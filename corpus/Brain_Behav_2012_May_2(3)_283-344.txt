Introduction
Convulsive interventions have been used to treat mental disorders since the 16th century and even today in the form of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Ugo Cerletti and Luigi Bini demonstrated ECT in Rome for the first time in 1938 (). The ECT intervention per se, that is, the application of electrical current to the scalp in order to provoke a generalized epileptic seizure, for the purpose of alleviating psychotic and depressive symptoms, is still much the same today as it was in the beginning. Modifications of Cerletti and Bini's original bitemporal placement of electrodes to the scalp, administering 120 V sine-wave electrical current to the head (), include the development of newer brief-pulse electrical current wave devices and unilateral (UL) placement of electrodes.

ECT was originally used in the treatment of schizophrenia. ECTs effectiveness for patients with depression was established in 1941 (). The use of ECT declined in the 1970s and 1980s after the introduction of pharmacotherapy for severe mental disorders (). The main indication for ECT also transformed from first-line to last-resort treatment for medication-resistant and very severe life-threatening clinical conditions (; ). However, in 2001, guidelines developed by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) advised that ECT should not only be used as a last resort (). Situations of increased risk that need special attention are mentioned by international guidelines, such as patients with disorders of the central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory system (; ; ). As a result of cognitive side effects (memory impairment) association with sine-wave current (), it is now advised that brief-pulse wave be the standard treatment (; ; ). The use of sine-wave constant voltage and constant energy devices is currently not considered justified (APA guidelines) ().

ECT spread rapidly from Europe to other continents and to the United States, due to the Second World War's displacement of psychiatrists (). In the beginning, ECT was administered without anesthesia (termed unmodified ECT) and later, under anesthesia together with muscle relaxant succinylcholine medication (termed modified ECT), in order to reduce side effects from the convulsions, such as bone fractures, teeth, tendon, and muscular damage. In the last decade, modified ECT has been recommended as the standard routine according to internationally established guidelines (; ; ).

ECT's mode of action has still not been clarified (). Despite documented efficacy for alleviating symptoms of depression (), ECT still remains controversial and stigma-bound. Reported side effects, such as memory impairment (), and whether ECT induces long-term permanent cognitive impairment remains yet obscure.

Worldwide, it has been estimated that about one million patients receive ECT annually (). ECT appears to have become a widely available treatment for mental disorders on all continents (), in USA/Canada and Latin America (; ), Western Europe (; ) and Russia (), Africa and Asia (). Despite international guidelines (; ; ), large variations in clinical practice between countries and regions have been reported (; ; ; ). Reports on ECT utilization also largely vary. There have been some international studies. A study by Van Waarde et al. () included data from nine other countries and another by Gazdag et al. () presented an overview of 13 surveys undertaken on the use of ECT in the past 10 years. In the United States, the nationwide number of persons ECT treated per 10,000 resident population per year, was estimated to be 4.9 in 1995 (). On the whole, there seems to be a paucity of updated ECT utilization surveys, reviews, and data. There is, therefore, an imminent need for a systematic international review concerning contemporary use of ECT. Against this background, the main objective of this article is to give a systematic contemporary overview (from 1990) of the extent to which ECT is used worldwide.

Briefly the following aspects were considered. ECT utilization: ECT rates according to population, administration frequency, and inpatient prevalence rates; ECT parameters: the manner in which ECT is applied (modified or unmodified, brief-pulse or sine-wave current, device type, electrode placement bilateral [BL] or unilateral [UL]); and ECT practice: diagnoses, indications, gender, age, conditions (consent or involuntary), settings (ambulatory), under which ECT is applied.

Material and Methods
Data sources and search strategy
A systematic literature search was undertaken in the following databases. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, SveMed and EBSCO/Cinahl, limited from 1990 to November 2010 (, ). Search terms intended for Medline were adapted as required for other databases. Terms used were “electroconvulsive therapy,”“electroshock,”“electroconvulsive,”“ECT,” combined with any of the following “use,”“utilization,”“practice,”“survey,”“statistical data,”“frequency,” limited to human studies and dating from 1990 to today. Relevant references, known to authors of this review published on governmental internet sites or from newly published text books () or reference lists in retrieved included papers, were also hand found.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria: Data-based observational studies or surveys with reported ECT utilization, frequency, or prevalence rates, by data collected from 1990 and above, for patients in psychiatric establishments (inpatients or outpatients) in well-defined continents, countries, regions, cities, or local hospitals. Also included were relevant studies published near the date limits for this study (from 1990), for geographical areas that had few pertinent publications.

Studies in the following languages were included: English, Scandinavian (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish), and European (German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish). In addition to authors’ European language fluency, the online Google translation tool (http://translate.google.com/) was used when needed (e.g., for Portuguese and Turkish).

Following exclusion criteria were included. Not data-based study or survey, no or unclear report of ECT utilization, frequency, prevalence rate, practice, in unclearly defined populations. All report of utilization frequency, prevalence rates of ECT in selected samples or subgroups (e.g., young/adolescent, elderly) or special populations (such as pregnancy, disability, mental retardation), and qualitative studies about clinician or physician subjective experience (views or opinions) on ECT.

Screening of literature
Two reviewers (KAL, BH) independently checked the titles, and where available, the abstracts of the studies identified by the electronic database searches. All references appearing to meet inclusion criteria, including those with insufficient details, were requested in full text. All reviewers (KAL, LJVS, BH) consisting of two pairs independently extracted data from the retrieved full-text articles according to a premade data extraction scheme. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus meeting/discussion, and the final decision was made by the first author (KAL).

Data extraction and data analyses
Where possible, utilization data have been presented as either (1) number of persons ECT treated per 10,000 resident population per year, that is, treated person rate (TPR), (2) number of ECT administrations per 10,000 resident population per year, that is, ECT administration rate (EAR), (3) the proportion in percent (%) of ECT-treated patients among the inpatient (psychiatric ward, hospital admitted) population, that is, inpatient prevalence (iP%), and (4) average number of ECTs administered per patient (in a series or course), that is, average ECT number (AvE). Information about ECT parameters, diagnoses and main indications, gender and age is also presented. Other information such as ethnicity, education, side effects, mortality, adverse events, use of written consent, involuntary conditions has also been noted.

Study selection
The study selection process, databases searched and total numbers of references identified (N= 1403), title and abstract screened (N= 851), full-text screened (N= 101), included for data extraction (N= 70) and full text excluded (N= 31) references are given in .

Flow chart of study-selection process.

Description of studies
Overview of included studies (N= 70) and data extracted is given in , sorted according to the continents: Australia and New Zealand (N= 7), Africa (N= 3), North and Latin America (N= 12), Europe (N= 33), and Asia (N= 15). Each reference was categorized according to the data presented, whether it represented the Land (n= 27), Region (n= 13), City (n= 11), or Hospital (n= 19).

Overview of full text excluded references (N= 31) and reasons for exclusion are given in . Five references were found not relevant in topic, 10 had no rate or prevalence data or insufficient/too sparse data, six were parallelly published in other languages than English or not possible to find/full-text retrieve, and the data in nine were evaluated too old, collected before 1990.

Detailed summery of findings tables of included full-text studies are presented in , – according to the five continents: (1) Australia and New Zealand, (2) Africa, (3) North and Latin America, (4) Europe and (5) Asia.

Seven studies were included from Australia and New Zealand, including a recent one from Sydney (). Only three of six studies from Africa were included, representing Malawi, Nigeria, and South Africa. The three excluded () were two from Nigeria and one from Egypt, due to data being too old (before 1990), insufficient, and sparse. One of the two included studies from Latin America, claimed representation of 17 Latin American and four Caribbean countries, but with unstated names except for Haiti being excluded (). Two of the 10 studies from North America represented Medicare populations (; ) leaving many of all USA's 50 States not represented. A study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) was found too old (). Altogether, 33 studies were included from Europe and nine were from the Nordic countries. Twelve identified European studies, including one study from Italy (), did not meet inclusion criteria (). Surveys including a number of countries were identified from Asia (; ; ) and 15 studies from this continent were included. ECT practice was verified from 27 Asian countries: Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, South Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam (), Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands (), and Saudi Arabia (). ECT was reported not available in all countries, such as Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Georgia, Laos, and Lebanon (), Micronesia and Palau (). The countries Cyprus, Macoa, Qatar, and Maldives had also been excluded by a survey ().

Overall, the included studies displayed a large heterogeneity in the presentation of rate and prevalence data and practice of ECT worldwide. On a global basis, a crude estimate (from numbers given in , –) of worldwide contemporary TPR (SD) (age &lt; 65 years) was 2.34 (1.56); EAR (SD), 11.2 (9.0); iP (SD) 6.1 (6.9); and AvE (SD) 8 (1.4). Globally, under half of all psychiatric institutions within the same country provided ECT. Main findings of ECT utilization, parameters, and practice from the five continents are presented below.

ECT Utilization
Treated person rate
Overview of TPR from all countries providing such data is illustrated in .

Worldwide Treated Person Rates (TPR)—number of ECTs per 10,000 resident population per year. [Correction added after first online publication on 20 March 2012: The TPR column for UK (Department of Health 2007) has been changed to 1.84.]

TPR () varied from 0.75 in New Zealand () to 4.4 in Victoria, Australia (). TPR in the USA Medicare population was 5.1 (5.7 women; 3.6 men) (). TPR by age groups (and therefore not included in ) ranged from 0.0001 (&lt;18 years) to 3.8 (&gt;65 years) in California (). TPR for the elderly (&gt;65 years) in the Medicare population was from 2.4 to 4.2, (; ) and varied from 3.8 West USA to 6.1 in the Northeast, as well as between rural (TPR 3.2) to large urban areas (TPR 6.0) (). TPR variations within the same State were reported from Louisiana, TPR (&gt;65 years): 2.8 urban parishes versus 1.9 rural parishes ().

TPR in Europe varied between countries and regions and between individual centers (), with the lowest TPR 0.11 in Poland (). The within-country regional variation in Belgium (TPR 2.6–10.6) was reported as significant (), which was also the case for Norway (TPR 1.83–3.44) (). In South Africa, TPR was 1.26 (). In Asia, TPR was only reported from Thailand 1.15 () and Hong Kong ranging 0.27–0.34 (; ; ).

Inpatient prevalence
Overview of iP from all countries providing such data is illustrated in .

Inpatient prevalence rate (iP%)—percent of ECT-treated patients among inpatient population.

The iP was highest in Africa 21–28% (; ), Nepal 22%, (), and overall in Asia estimated between &lt;9% and 26% (). In the United States, iP was lowest, from 0.4% to 1.3% (; ), similar to Hong Kong was 0.6–1.8% (; ). In Australia, iP ranged from 1% to 8% (; ), and in Europe from 0.6% (Hungary) () to 14% (Turkey) ().

Average ECT number
The AvE in New Zealand and Australia ranged from seven to 12 (; ; ), in Africa from one to 10, (; ), in USA from five (; ) to 12 (), USA overall seven to eight (; ; ), and in Brazil eight () (, –). AvE in Europe ranged from five () to 11 (), except Sweden where it was one to 22 (). AvE in Pakistan was one to 20 (), in Nepal two to 16 (), and generally in Asia between six and eight.

ECT Parameters
Unmodified and modified
All parameter report in Australia and New Zealand indicated modified ECT (; ; ; ), similarly in the United States (; ; ). ECT in Africa was generally administered unmodified and in Malawi modified after 2007 (; ). A study excluded from Nigeria reported modified ECT administered in 1979, but found too expensive ().

In Europe, all parameter report indicated modified ECT, except for Russia (in contrast to Hungary [], with obligatory anesthesia) where &gt;80% was unmodified (). In the Chuvash Republic, ECT was modified, but 40% without use of muscle relaxants (and administered mainly to women with schizophrenia) (). In Spain, 0.6% received unmodified ECT, and 2.3% without muscle relaxants ().

A large survey in Asia with 23 countries investigated reported 129,906 unmodified ECTs administered to 22,194 patients (55.7%) at 141 (54.9%) institutions in 14 countries (61%) (). Two-thirds of patients were treated unmodified in Japan (1997–1999) (), and 20% of all institutions administered only unmodified, with only sine-wave approved devices. In a later survey from Japan (2001–2003), unmodified comprised 57% of all administered ECTs (). Patients selected for modified (with anesthesia) in Japan were mainly elderly or with medical conditions (). In Thailand, almost all (94%) ECT administration was unmodified (). In India, both modified and unmodified ECT was administered (), 52% of patients received unmodified at 50% of all institutions, and 30% of institutions administered only unmodified.

Overall in Asia, only 45% of facilities used modified ECT exclusively (), in Hong Kong 87% modified (), and the Asian Pacific Region () and Katmandu, Nepal, used only modified (). Eight facilities in Asia reported succinylcholine muscle relaxant used routinely without anesthesia (). Anesthesia was also used without muscle relaxants in Japan, and extreme motion from the convulsions held down with aid of assistants restraining patient's shoulders, arms, and thighs ().

Overall, 26% Latin American countries used unmodified ECT (), except for all modified in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and one country in the Caribbean (; ).

Placement and devices
On a worldwide scale, BL placement was the preferred electrode placement. However, UL placement was the first main choice in Australia and New Zealand (; ; ; ), likewise to several European countries such as Vienna (), Munich (), Netherlands (), and Norway ().

In the United States, there was some sine wave (2%) () and some UL (16–21%) (; ; ) report, but BL placement (73–79%) and brief-pulse wave current (; ; ) was mainstream. Similarly, brief-pulse wave current devices were dominant in Europe, except sine-wave current still used in Spain 14% (), Russia 26% (), Belgium 34% (), Poland 30% (), Germany 39% (), and Hungary 52% ().

Overall electrode placement in Asia was BL (77%) (). Thailand () and Japan () reported only the use of BL and India always reported the use of BL in 82% (). In Asia, 58% of institutions used brief-pulse devices and 42% sine wave (). In Japan, the device type was often Japanese-produced Sakai C1, but also some had Thymatron® DGx devices (Somatics, Inc., http://www.thymatron.com) (). In India, a diversity of devices was in use, including locally made (). In Katmandu, Nepal, device type was only brief pulse ().

ECT Practice
Provision of ECT and training
In Australia, ECT was provided by 66% institutions and ECT training by 73% ().

In the tri-state New York City metropolitan region, 55% of institutions provided ECT (), 33% in Texas (), and 44% of all psychiatric hospitals in North Carolina (). A decrease from 1990 to 1994 in provision of ECT was reported in California and ECT provided by public institutions to be very low, &lt;6% ().

In Europe, ECT provision in the Netherlands was 23% (), Belgium nationwide 22% (), Flanders and Brussels capital region 26% (), Poland 34% (), Spain and Russia 46% (; ), France 51% (), Hungary 57% (), Germany 59% (), Norway 72% (), and in Denmark 100% (). In Norway, patients had to wait up to eight weeks for treatment due to a low capacity in administrating ECT ().

ECT was mainly performed by junior doctors in Denmark (), England (), and Norway (). In Norway, 6% of ECTs were administered by nurses () and in the Netherlands sometimes by geriatricians or physicians (). About one-third of clinics in England had developed clear policies to help guide junior doctors in administering ECT effectively (). ECT teaching programs were found at 59% of institutions in India (), and 78% in Japan, but rated in 10% as fair to poor (). Acceptable ECT training in Thailand was only found for five hospitals (). In Saudi Arabia, a two-lecture course on ECT was given every year for junior doctors, as well as practical demonstration and training ().

Diagnoses and diagnostic indication
Main diagnoses, diagnostic indication for ECT in Australia, New Zealand, USA, South America, and Africa, are illustrated in .

Diagnoses and ECT in Australia, New Zealand, USA, South America, Africa.

Affective disorder (unipolar/bipolar depression) was the main diagnoses in Australia and New Zealand (; ; ; ; ), but other main indications for administering ECT were also noted (), such as being too distressed to await drug response, patient preference, previous response, life saving, and medication resistance. Affective disorders (unipolar/bipolar depression) were also the main diagnoses in USA (72–92%), and schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorders were much less (8–29%) (; ; ; ; ; ; ). However in Africa, the main diagnoses were schizophrenia and psychotic conditions (60–83%) (; ; ), and in Brazil 49% of cases reported same conditions ().

Main diagnoses, diagnostic indication for ECT in Europe, are illustrated in .

Diagnoses and ECT in Europe.

Although affective disorders (unipolar and/or bipolar depression with or without psychosis) were the most prominent in Europe (), schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder were major in Hungary 64%, Chuvash Republic 88%, and Turkey 37% (; ; ).

Schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder were much less common in Belgium 5% (), Norway 5% (), Ireland 4% (), and Scotland 5% (). ECT for mania varied from 0.2% (Munich) () to 12% (Spain) (). The main indication for ECT was medication resistance, but also life saving, catatonia, previous good response, and patient preference (; ; ; ). ECT administered under pregnancy was noted at 10 Polish sites () and in Spain ().

Main diagnoses, diagnostic indication for ECT in Asia, are illustrated in .

Diagnoses and ECT in Asia.

Main diagnostic indication in Asia overall (; ; , ) was schizophrenia (; ; ). However, in Saudi Arabia (), Pakistan (), and Hong Kong (), depressive illness was the main indication (over 60%). Reasons for giving ECT to patients with schizophrenia (74%) in Thailand was small budget for mental health care and no antipsychotics included in the essential drug list from the Ministry of Health (). In India, ECT was prescribed to other diagnoses, including drug abuse (). Indication for ECT in Asia was also severe violence, suicide and refractory treatment (), need of rapid improvement (), drug resistance, or life-threatening situation (), and in Saudi Arabia 35% as first-choice emergency treatment ().

ECT-treated patients in Australia and New Zealand were mainly women (63–71%) (; ; ; ; ; ), and one-third of patients were above 65 years (; ; ; ; ; ). Similarly in the United States, 66–79% of patients were women (; ; ; ; ; ), and 48–59% were elderly (over 60 years) (; ; ). In New Zealand, &gt;80% were of European ethnicity () and in USA Caucasian white ethnicity was dominant (87% to &gt;90%) (; ; ; ; ). A typical ECT patient in the United States was said to be an elderly white female paying for treatment with insurance or private funds ().

In Europe, not all studies reported gender and age, such as Russia () and Denmark (). The percent of ECT-treated European women ranged from 44% to 81%. Mean age for ECT in Europe was overall high (49–66 years) (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ), except 33.1–35.1 years in Turkey (; ) and 34.4 years in the Chuvash Republic (). Patients above 64 years seldom received ECT in Turkey (1–3%) (; ), in the Chuvash Republic none (). UK's National Health Service data revealed 0.2% ECT-given young patients (16–18, but none &lt;16 years) in 2007 (). The highest treatment rates in the United Kingdom were found among those with Caucasian white ethnicity ().

In Africa, men were treated with ECT more often than women (29% women), and mean age was young (30.7 [], range 17–37 years []). Similarly, percent of ECT-treated female patients in Asia was generally low, for example, 28% Katmandu () 33% Emirates (), 39% India (), 28–63% Thailand (; ), and overall estimated to be 38% (). In some places, the female proportion was higher, for example, 51% Japan (), 56% Pakistan (), 60% Saudi Arabia (), and 68–88% Hong Kong (, ). In Saudi Arabia, the typical ECT patient was described to be a Saudi married woman, with medium level of education, living in the City, not employed outside the home, and with affective disorder (). Proportion of young (&lt;18 years) ECT-treated patients in Asia was overall 6% (), 5% Hong Kong (), 1% India (), and 11% (&lt;19 years) Katmandu (). In Thailand, ECT-treated patients with schizophrenia were younger than those with depression ().

Other data—conditions, adverse events, side effects, training, guidelines, legal regulations conditions
In Australia and New Zealand, consent by Mental Health Review Tribunal varied from 21% to 60% (; ). In the United States, use of informed consent was noted as 37% always and 26% never (), involuntary conditions and use of guardian consent ranged from 1–2% in Texas (; ), 3% California () to 29% North Carolina (). From 1993, mandatory report of ECT use to health authorities was initiated in Texas and ECT use was prohibited for patients &lt;16 years of age ().

Report of involuntary ECT conditions varied in Europe from 1% in Spain (), 3.2% Denmark (2009) (), to 20% Germany (), 24% Scotland (), and 26% in Finland (). In Scotland, 18% of patients received ECT under the safeguards of the Scottish Mental Health Act of 1984 (), and in England 60%, of those formally detained, did not consent to ECT treatment ().

The use of written informed consent documents was obligatory in Poland (), and reported as 15% in Germany (), 44% in Belgium (), and 50% in Norway (). Written informed consent was mainly obtained from family members in Japan (; ), Thailand (), and Pakistan (), and countersigning by a near relative practiced in Saudi Arabia (). In Hong Kong, 13% were judged incapable of giving informed consent ().

Adverse events and side effects
Adverse events (within two weeks after ECT) in Texas, in 1998 (), were eight deaths (two were noted as possibly anesthesia-related complications) and in 2000, 25 deaths (), with mortality rate (within two weeks after ECT) estimated at 14 deaths per 100,000 treatments (). Side effects were noted in 37% in Japan, including one case of compression fractures of vertebrae (). Side effects from unmodified ECT in India were fractures, dislocations, teeth injury, and one death in the one-year study period (). Mortality rate was estimated 0.08% in Thailand (), although there were no ECT-related deaths in the survey period.

Maintenance, continuation, and ambulatory ECT
Maintenance ECT was practiced in Texas (), and continuation ECT (C-ECT) in Australia (). Ambulatory ECT (A-ECT) was lacking in the Chuvash Republic (), rarely used in Belgium (), and not performed in Polish outpatients clinics (). A-ECT was reported available in 2% of Russian institutions () and 63% of Norwegian (). Proportion of A-ECT-treated patients was 15% in Norway (), 16% Wales (), 18% Ireland (), and 19% UK (). A-ECT was also practiced in Thailand () but A-ECT and C-ECT rarely were used in Hong Kong (). In India, C-ECT report varied from given to 1–10% to 60% of patients ().

Legislation and guidelines
In Victoria, Australia legislation requires mandatory monthly reports (). In Poland () and the Chuvash Republic (), the presence of an anesthetist under ECT was mandatory.

Locally developed guidelines were described in Norway (; ) and Vienna (), and in Belgium less than 44% of departments did not follow guidelines (). Guidelines were used only by 28% of Japanese institutions (). In Hong Kong, a hospital policy of patient assessment every one to two treatments during an ECT course was practiced only sometimes ().

Other—funding and attitudes
Over half (57%) funding of ECT in the United States was financed by public third party payment source (including Medicare) (). Attitudes of psychiatrists toward ECT were generally favorable in Europe, for example, in Spain (), Germany (), Russia (), and Norway (). Reasons for not prescribing ECT in Europe were attributed to lack of equipment, economy, and difficulties in recruiting anesthetist (; ; ; ).

Main findings of this review are summarized as follows:
There is a large variation in ECT utilization and practice worldwide today. Global crude estimates of TPR (age &lt; 65 years) is 2.34, EAR 11.2, iP 6.1, and AvE eight. Only some (usually under half) of all institutions within the same country provide ECT. Mandatory report of ECT use and monitoring by governmental agents is overall scant. Reporting of side effects, adverse events, and mortality is sparse. The results reflect that the guidelines by APA and Royal College of Psychiatrists are not internationally acknowledged, except in Western countries, and therefore the lack of implementation may be rational in these regions of the world.

Overall, there is a considerable variation in ECT administration and parameters worldwide. Unmodified ECT is substantially used today, not only in Asia (over 90%), Africa, Latin America, but also occurs in Europe (Russia, Turkey, and Spain). The most common electrode placement is BL, but a few places in Europe and Australia/New Zealand adhere to UL as first choice. Brief-pulse wave current devices are used worldwide, but old sine-wave stimulus and apparatus still in use.

In Western countries (Europe, USA, Australia, and New Zealand), ECT is at large administered to elderly female patients with depressive disorders. In those areas of the world (Asia, Africa, Latin America, Russia), where ECT is still often administered unmodified, it is predominantly prescribed to younger patients (often more male) with schizophrenia. ECT is administered worldwide under involuntary and guardian consent conditions (ranging from a few percent up to nearly two-thirds). (Involuntary conditions, implying also ECT administered under involuntary admission, are though in the extracted data but not always directly equivalent or indicative of involuntary [against wish] treatment.)

New trends are revealed. ECT is used as first-line acute treatment and not only last resort for medication resistant conditions in many countries. Other professions than psychiatrists (geriatricians and nurses) are administering ECT. ECT use among outpatients (ambulatory setting) is increasing.



Discussion
ECT utilization and practice are presented from all continents of the world in this review, representing a widespread use of ECT in the today's world. Two continents, Africa and Latin America, have sparse ECT country data, which might indicate a trend away from ECT (), but this does not at all seem to be the case in the rest of the world. Although the report of ECT seems abundant in Europe, Asia, and America, the data do not cover all countries known to have ECT practice. For example, no “up to date” 1990 and after ECT studies are identified from either Iceland or Canada.

Large variations between continents, countries, and regions in ECT utilization, rates, and clinical practice are displayed, despite international guidelines (; ; ). Due to no uniform standard of reporting ECT utilization, rates are computed in the data extraction to TPR per 10,000, to make it comparable. This revealed a large worldwide TPR variation, from 0.11 () to 5.1 (). Likewise worldwide iPs varied greatly. Although the large worldwide differences in ECT utilization have been pointed out previously (; ; ; ), and the differences between countries on the basis of practice reports are not so easy to compare (), overall variations in contemporary practice between the continents (Asia and Africa vs. USA, Australia and New Zealand, Europe) revealed by this review are immense. Explanations of these variations are complex, encompassing not only the diversity in organization of psychiatric services, but no doubt also grounded in professional beliefs concerning the efficacy and safety of ECT (). On a worldwide scale, the number of patients receiving unmodified ECT is large, nearly 20,000 of patients in India (), over 6000 in Thailand (), and overall in Asia estimated at 11.2 patients treated with unmodified ECT per 100,000 ().

Diverse reasons for this high use of unmodified ECT have been put forth, such as lack of equipment, personnel and anesthesiologists, contraindication for anesthesia, convenience, emergency, and economic purposes (). Whether these arguments are acceptable in this modern era and in light of knowledge about benefits and harms of ECT is another question. In spite of attempts to ban it (), the debate defending unmodified ECT practice (), and voices claiming this practice to be unjustified and unethical () is ongoing today. Unmodified ECT is still practiced in some parts of Russia, Turkey, and Spain (; ; ), and international guidelines (; ; ) appear to have failed () in influencing important aspects of today's ECT practice.

The practice in many countries of Asia (; , , ), Latin America (), and Africa (; ; ; ) bear a resemblance to the beginning of ECTs medical history in Europe (). The Asian practice of today resembles practice that was used in Finland in 1944 and 1964 (), where the majority of ECT-treated patients were diagnosed with schizophrenia (75–78%) and treated unmodified. Likewise, in 1944 in Finland, ECT was () more often given to men than women (36% women). In 1997 in Finland, a major shift occurred toward majority of patients (78%) having affective disorders (unipolar/bipolar depression) and treated modified (). This shift in Western world practice and the increasing use of ECT among women is also found both in USA and Australia, in the 1980s to 1990s (; ). Similar changes seem to be occurring in some areas of Asia (; ; ; ). One reason for the lingering ECT use among patients with schizophrenia might be availability of antipsychotic medication, such as in Thailand, where the essential drug list from the Ministry of Health does not include antipsychotics (). Also, shortage of anesthesiologist and negative images is another explanation that is given for having hindered Japanese psychiatrists from reforming ECT practice for a long time ().

Another explanation of practice differences, diagnostic and gender disparities between Asia and Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and USA might be the historical use of ECT, being much longer in Europe where it originated in 1938 () and its early spreading to the United States (; ; ). In Thailand, ECT was first administered unmodified in 1950, modified in 1974, and brief-pulse wave first applied in 1992 (). Whereas, in Japan, ECT was first administered unmodified in 1939 and modified 1958 (), but even so the practice of unmodified ECT in Japan in the 1990s is still profuse (; ).

In Europe, USA, and Australia/New Zealand, practice was almost entirely modified ECT and even in Hungary () anesthesia was obligatory. In several countries, Chuvash Republic, Russia, Spain, and Japan, the practice of modified ECT was sometimes without muscle relaxants (; ; ), and even assistants were used to restrain extreme motion from the convulsions in Japan (). The unusual practice of muscle relaxants without anesthesia is also undertaken in a few Asian institutions (), and availability and recruitment of anesthesiologists pointed out as a problem both in Asia and Europe (; ; ). On the other hand, Wales has no shortage of anesthesiologists ().

Preferred placement of electrodes worldwide (approximately 80%) is BL, as it was from the very beginning (), except for Australia, New Zealand (), Norway (), Vienna (), Munich (), and the Netherlands () where UL is the first choice, but they also use both types. Brief-pulse wave current devices appear widespread world widely. Many countries (Scandinavia, Australia, and New Zealand) adhere to brief-pulse wave and UL electrode placement as first choice (; ; ), no doubt due to the reported trade-off effect between effectiveness and memory impairment (), but switch to BL when the clinical response is judged as too poor. In spite of sine-wave current being declared unjustified by guidelines today (), it still occurs in Europe (14–52%) (; , ; ; ; ), Asia (30–58%) (, , ), and USA (2%) ().

Previous literature indicates a predominance of patients receiving ECT in Western countries to be elderly female with affective disorder (unipolar/bipolar depression) (; ; ; ; ), as is also confirmed by this review, and also in Hong Kong (). Except for age being younger, female and depression predominance was also the case for Saudi Arabia () and Pakistan (). In some European sites (Brussels and Wallonia in Belgium), ECT is regarded as an “antidepressant,” since it is used exclusively for the treatment of depressive disorder (). In contrast, ECT in Asia it is regarded as an “antipsychotic” agent (; , , ; ; ). Discrepancies in indication could be due to differences in diagnostic practice, a lower recognition, and under treatment of depressive disorder, and also lower mental health care budgets (). In contrast to Asia, the typical ECT patient in the United States is said to be an elderly white female paying for treatment with insurance or private funds (). Higher ECT treatment rates are found among Caucasian white ethnicity in Pennsylvania (), England (), and Western Australia (), which might imply discriminatory factors in treatment selection.

Worldwide, there is a general tendency toward a low, within-country, ECT provision by psychiatric institutions, varying from below 6% in USA (), to 23–51% in Europe (; , ; ; ; ), 66% in Australia (), and 59–78% in Asia (, ). In Norway, institutions even have waiting lists for ECT treatment (). Altogether, this might indicate a trend toward ECT being provided by specialized units, but could also be a result of worldwide paucity in ECT training (; , ; ), and even changing treatment trends.

ECT has for a long time been over held as a last-resort treatment for medication-resistant and very severe life-threatening clinical conditions (; ), as reported from USA (). However, a transformation in ECT indication into first-line acute treatment (life saving, catatonia, previous good response, and patient preference) is apparent not only in Europe (; ; ; ), but also in Saudi Arabia () and Australia (). Although world widely ECT is mainly administered by psychiatrists and trainee psychiatrists, another change is that of other professions than psychiatrists (geriatricians and nurses) administering ECT in Europe (; ). The trend toward increasing ambulatory ECT and ECT use among outpatients in Europe (15–19%) (; ; ; ) is conceivably, parallel to other ambulatory treatment tendencies, out of the best interest to the recovering patient and his caregivers.

Overall, the report of side effects, adverse events, and mortality rates is sparse. Although mortality rate is reported from Thailand (0.08%) () and Texas (14 deaths per 100,000 treatments within two weeks after ECT) (), it is not clear if the ECT-related deaths are due to lethal side effects (e.g., cardiac arrhythmia) or comorbid somatic illnesses or anesthetic complications.

ECT is administered worldwide under involuntary and guardian consent conditions, ranging from a few percent in USA and Europe 1–3% (; ; ; ; ) to 20–29% (; ; ; ). Involuntary conditions in the extracted data though cannot be taken as directly equivalent to or directly indicative of involuntary (against wish) treatment. In Asia, written informed consent is mainly obtained directly or counter signed by family members (; ; ; ). Consent given by legal bodies varies from 18% in Scotland (under the Scottish Mental Health Act) () to 60% in Sydney, Australia (by the Mental Health Review Tribunal) (). Mandatory ECT data reporting is almost nonexistent and found only in a few places (Texas, USA, and Australia) (; ; ). Likewise legislature regulating practice, such as obligatory anesthesia (), obligatory written informed patient consent (), ECT licensed facilities (), prohibited administered to persons under 16 years of age (), involuntary by order of court or legal body (; ), is also nonexistent.

Implications of findings
Worldwide improvement of ECT utilization and practice is needed, alongside development of an international minimal dataset standard applied in all countries. Continuous and mandatory monitoring and use of ECT health registrar reporting systems, taking into account patient confidentiality, would also ultimately reduce our knowledge gaps. This would again contribute to more uniform worldwide ECT practice, to the best for the patient.

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study are the extensive search strategy, high number of included studies, methodological transparency, and summary of findings table, providing an overview of contemporary worldwide use of ECT, which has not been undertaken in such detail previously. Limitations of this review are the inclusion of nonrandomized survey/questionnaire studies, based on practitioner accounts of ECT use, influencing the precision of the estimated rates, either to be overestimated or underestimated depending on the accuracy of the source. Seemingly, more accurate are direct reports from individual hospitals studies or national registers. The overall diversity in practice data reporting unclear representativeness of region or land as a whole and large heterogeneity in reported ECT utilization rates did not lend the data to meta-analyses. National overviews of ECT data published by regulatory bodies or governmental agencies on the internet are not so easily accessed, despite such internet sites being hand searched. National government overviews do not usually appear in the databases where systematic literature search of published journal articles and studies is undertaken.

Conclusion
Today utilization rates, practice, and ECT parameters vary greatly throughout continents and countries. Unmodified ECT is still in use (Asia, Africa, Latin America, and even in Europe). In spite of existing guidelines, there is no uniform worldwide practice. Large global variation in ECT utilization, administration, and practice advocates a need for worldwide sharing of knowledge about ECT, reflection, and learning from each other's experiences.

This study has been possible because of research commissioning on the topic “ECT for depression” from the Norwegian Directorate of Health to the Norwegian Knowledge Centre. We thank the Norwegian Knowledge Centre's research librarian K. T. Hammerstrøm (KTH) for designing and undertaking the literature search in collaboration with the authors. We also extend our gratitude to M. J. Cooke, Bergen University Psychiatric Hospital Psychosis Unit, for all her helpful English language correction. This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.
