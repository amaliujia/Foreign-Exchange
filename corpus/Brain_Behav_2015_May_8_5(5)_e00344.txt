In the Materials and Methods section, under the sub-headers of Questionnaires, Linköping's youth life events scale- adult, LYLES –A, the following was mentioned:

“The test–retest reliability has been found to be r = 0.79 (P &lt; 0.01) and kappa statistics (Cohen's kappa) item per item range between 0.44 and 1.0 (Finkelhor et al. 2007b).”

The correct reference citation for this statement should be (Nilsson et al. 2010) and not (Finkelhor et al. 2007b).

We apologize for this error.
