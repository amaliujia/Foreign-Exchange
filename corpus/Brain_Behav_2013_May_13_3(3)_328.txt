On page 149, the sentence “In these cisterns the sigma-1 receptor is present to buffer calcium entry overload (Mavlyutov et al. 2010)” should be changed to the following: “At these cisterns, the sigma-1 receptor may play an indirect action modulating intracellular calcium release (Mavlyutov et al. 2010).”

We regret this misinterpretation. It has no consequences for the reported analyses and conclusions.
