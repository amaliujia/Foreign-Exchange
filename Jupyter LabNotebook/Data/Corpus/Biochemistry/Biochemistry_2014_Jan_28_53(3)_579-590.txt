Metal cations
play several essential
functions in the biochemistry of RNA. Although Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions are the predominant
cations in cells, Mg2+ is considered to be the most important
in RNA folding.− Mg2+ can mediate helical packing, promote long-range interactions,,− organize multiway junction, stabilize
RNA motifs,− and reduce conformational fluctuations.,, Mg2+ is particularly
adept at stabilizing tightly packed phosphate oxygens found in several
RNA conformations because of its small ionic radius, high charge density,
and well-defined octahedral geometry that accommodates six inner-sphere
ligands. In addition, Mg2+ can either form outer-sphere
interactions with ligands through its first-hydration shell or specific
inner-sphere interactions by displacing a water molecule and interacting
directly with a ligand.

Following the discovery of the catalytic
properties of ribozymes,
the role of Mg2+ ions in catalysis has been intensively
investigated. Mg2+ ions can play either a direct or an
indirect role in the enzymatic mechanism.,− Direct roles have been demonstrated including nucleophile
activation,, coordination of nonbridging oxygens
of the scissile phosphate, promoting
the optimal geometry of the reactive species, and stabilization of the leaving group. Potential indirect roles have been proposed involving long-range
electrostatic stabilization and/or alteration
of pKa’s to facilitate a general
acid–base mechanism.,,

The Neurospora Varkud satellite (VS) ribozyme
is a member of the small nucleolytic ribozyme family that also includes
the hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and glms ribozymes.− The VS ribozyme self-cleaves at the phosphodiester bond between
G620 and A621 to generate products with 5′-OH and 2′–3′-cyclic
phosphate termini. Its secondary structure contains six helical domains:
the stem-loop I (SLI) contains the cleavage site and is considered
as the substrate domain, whereas stem-loops II–VI (SLII–SLVI)
form the catalytic domain (Figure A). Substrate recognition is defined by a high-affinity
kissing-loop interaction between the SLI and SLV terminal loops (Figure A) that induces a conformational change within the
SLI substrate that is necessary for catalysis.,− The proposed general acid–base mechanism involves
the close association of the SLI and SLVI internal loops to form the
active site,− where two nucleobases, G638 of SLI and A756 of the A730 loop, act as the general base and acid, respectively,
in the cleavage reaction.,− Although the secondary and tertiary structures of the VS ribozyme
are unique among the nucleolytic ribozymes, its cleavage mechanism
is similar to that of the hairpin ribozyme in which the active site
is also formed by the docking of two internal loops, and a nucleobase
from each loop participates in the general acid–base mechanism.

Primary and secondary structures of the Neurospora VS ribozyme and the SLVI RNA. (A) trans-Cleaving VS ribozyme (containing
wild-type residues 648–777) with an SLI substrate. The cleavage
site is shown by an arrow. Both the cleavage site internal loop and
the active-site internal loop are shaded in gray, and the I/V kissing-loop
interaction is boxed. (B) SLVI RNA, which includes the A730 loop of
the VS ribozyme (gray shading). Phosphate groups that display inhibitory
effects on cleavage when substituted by phosphorothioates are indicated
by an arrow, and the arrow is filled for those cases where the activity
can be rescued by addition of Mn2+ ions. For this study, single phosphorothioate SLVI RNAs were
prepared that contain either an Sp or Rp phosphorothioate
at one of the phosphates indicated by black stars.

The VS ribozyme is dependent on the presence of
divalent metal
ions (Mg2+, Mn2+, or Ca2+) or high
concentration of monovalent salt for its cleavage activity., Mg2+ ions have been found to be very important for several
aspects of folding and function in the VS ribozyme. They are critical
for substrate recognition, both for proper formation of the I/V kissing-loop
interaction and for the conformational change in SLI.,, In addition, they are required
for folding of the two three-way junctions and for formation of the active site., Metal cations
do not play a direct role in the general acid–base mechanism
but appear to play an indirect role by altering the pKa of the two key nucleobases.,

Phosphorothioate interference, chemical modifications, nucleotide
analogue interference mapping, and NMR studies have been previously
conducted in attempts to identify precisely the metal-binding sites
in the VS ribozyme.,,− In the phosphorothioate interference-rescue experiments, the effect
of pro-Rp phosphorothioate substitutions
in the VS ribozyme were monitored on the Mg2+-dependent
cleavage, and several substitutions were shown to reduce the cleavage
activity significantly. Interestingly,
the phosphorothioate inhibition of cleavage for select residues of
the SLI loop (U631), the SLV loop (C699), and
the A730 loop (G757 and C758) could be rescued
by thiophilic Mn2+ ions, suggesting that these phosphates
are involved in inner-sphere metal coordination.

Recently, we performed NMR studies with a small stem-loop
containing
the A730 internal loop, termed SLVI (Figure B), in order to gain structural insights into the formation of the
VS ribozyme active site. We established
that Mg2+ ions are required to stabilize the structure
of the A730 loop, and we determined the NMR structure of SLVI in the
presence of Mg2+ ions. The NMR structure reveals a cis-WC/WC G–A base pair and an S-turn motif in the
A730 loop that protrude the A756 into an enlarged minor
groove such that it becomes available to participate in catalysis.
Here, we extend these investigations by defining the precise locations
of associated Mg2+ ions by combining Mn2+-induced
paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) with Cd2+-induced
chemical-shift perturbation (CSP) of phosphorothioate RNAs. These
data are used to refine the NMR structure of SLVI to include five
Mg2+-ion binding sites. Four of the binding sites are associated
with known RNA structural motifs, including the GNRA tetraloop and
the G–U wobble pair. A comparison with similar structures from
the PDB reveals new insights into the role of cation-binding sites
in RNA structure. In agreement with the prior phosphorothioate interference-rescue
experiments with the VS ribozyme, one
Mg2+ ion is associated with the S-turn motif, revealing
its role in the folding of the A730 loop as well as a possible indirect
role in catalysis.

Experimental Procedures
Sample Preparation
Unlabeled, 15N-labeled,
and 13C/15N-labeled SLVI RNAs (Figure B) were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase
(prepared in-house) and purified as described previously. The SLVI RNAs containing phosphorothioate modifications
at nonbridging phosphate oxygens (phosphorothioate RNAs; Figure B) were purchased as diastereomeric mixtures (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, MA). These mixtures were first purified by denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20% acrylamide/bisacrylamide 19:1
and 7 M urea). The Rp and Sp isomers were subsequently
separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a μBondapak C-18 column (10
μm and 7.8 × 300 mm; Waters, MA) using a multilinear gradient
of HPLC-A (0.1 M ammonium acetate) and HPLC-B (0.1 M ammonium acetate
and 50% acetonitrile) buffers at 1 mL/min: (a) 0–10% HPLC-B
over 180 mL, (b) 10–13% HPLC-B over 120 mL, (c) 13–100%
HPLC-B over 5 mL, and (d) 100–0% over 5 mL. The precise determination
of configuration was made on the basis of enzymatic digestions with
snake venom phosphodiesterase and Nuclease P1.

The purified RNA samples were exchanged in NMR buffer
A (10 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 50 mM KCl, and 0.05 mM NaN3 in 90% H2O/10% D2O) with Amicon Ultra-4
centrifugation filter devices (Millipore, MA). The RNAs were then
heated at 95 °C for 2 min and then cooled in ice water for 5
min before changing to the final NMR buffer [NMR buffer A with either
5 mM MgCl2 99.995% (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) or a 5 mM mixture
of varying concentrations of MgCl2 99.995% and CdCl2 99.999% (Sigma-Aldrich, MO)]. For NMR studies in D2O, the samples were obtained by multiple cycles of lyophilization
and resuspension in 99.996% D2O.

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR experiments were conducted at
either 15 or 25 °C on Varian UnityINOVA 500 and 600
MHz spectrometers equipped with a pulse-field gradient unit and an
actively shielded z-gradient probe (either a 1H/13C/15N triple resonance probe or a 1H{15N–31P} indirect detection probe). The NMR spectra
were processed using the NMRPipe/NMRDraw package and analyzed with NMRView.1H, 13C, and 15N chemical shifts
were referenced to an external standard of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic
acid (DSS) at 0.00 ppm, and 31P chemical shifts were referenced to an external standard of 85%
phosphoric acid at 0.00 ppm.

Metal-Ion-Binding Studies
Manganese
(Mn2+) titrations were performed by adding small volumes
of a concentrated
solution (0.5 M) of 99.99% MnCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) directly
to the RNA sample to achieve final concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 40,
and 80 μM MnCl2. The first Mn2+ titration
was carried out with a 0.9 mM 13C/15N-labeled
SLVI sample in NMR buffer A with 5 mM MgCl2 and 100% D2O. The paramagnetic effect was monitored by collecting 2D 1H–13C CT-HSQC, and 2D 1H–13C HMQC spectra
at 25 °C. A second Mn2+ titration was carried out
with a 1.0 mM 15N-labeled SLVI sample in NMR buffer A with
5 mM MgCl2 and 90%:10% H2O/D2O. The
paramagnetic effect was monitored by 1D 1H watergate and imino- and amino-optimized 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra
at 15 °C. The third Mn2+ titration was carried out
with a 1.0 mM 15N-labeled SLVI sample in NMR buffer A with
5 mM MgCl2 and 100% D2O. The paramagnetic effect
was monitored by 2D long-range 1H–15N
HMQC spectra at 25 °C optimized
for detection of adenine N1/N3 atoms and purine N7/N9 atoms (JHN = 21 Hz).

Cadmium (Cd2+)
titrations were conducted by exchanging the RNA samples with Amicon
filters to NMR buffer A containing varying concentrations of CdCl2 and MgCl2. The total divalent-metal-ion concentration
was kept constant at 5 mM under all conditions. A first Cd2+ titration was conducted with a 0.2 mM 13C/15N-labeled SLVI RNA sample in 100% D2O and CdCl2 concentrations of 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, and 4.0
mM. Chemical-shift changes (1H and 13C) were
monitored for each CdCl2 concentration from 2D 1H–13C CT-HSQC, spectra recorded
at 25 °C. Additional Cd2+ titrations were conducted
for SLVI RNAs with phosphorothioate modifications (0.15–0.4
mM) in 90%:10% H2O/D2O and CdCl2 concentrations
of 0.0625, 0.125, and 0.25 mM. Chemical-shift changes (1H and 31P) were monitored for each CdCl2 concentration
from 1D 1H watergate and 1D 31P spectra recorded at 25 °C.

UV Spectroscopy and Determination
of Tm Values
Thermal-stability
studies of SLVI RNAs were
conducted with a Cary 300 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped
with a Peltier temperature-control accessory. All samples contained
5 μM SLVI RNA in NMR buffer A supplemented with divalent metal
ions (either 5 mM MgCl2 or 4.75 mM MgCl2/0.25
mM CdCl2). Control samples were also prepared that contained
only the selected buffers. Samples were heated from 25 to 98 °C
at a rate of 1 °C/min, and absorbance data were collected at
260 nm after each 1 °C temperature increment. Subtraction of
the control samples from the RNA samples was processed automatically
using a dual-beam mode. Melting temperatures (Tm) were determined from the second derivative of the absorbance
versus temperature curve, as previously described. Reported Tm are averaged values
derived from two or more individual UV-denaturation profiles.

Native
Gel Electrophoresis
Nondenaturing polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis was carried out on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, acrylamide/bisacrylamide
(37.5:1) in Tris-borate buffer (50 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.0) supplemented
with 20 mM magnesium acetate. The gels were prerun for 30 min at 200
V, loaded with RNA samples (2 μg of RNA at a concentration of
20 μM), and then run for 2 h at 250 V and 4 °C. The gels
were stained with Stains All (Sigma-Aldrich, MO).

Structural
Modeling of Mg(H2O)n2+-Binding Sites
Three-dimensional structures
of SLVI bound to Mg(H2O)n2+ complexes were determined by complementing previously defined
restraints with distance restraints to
position the five Mg(H2O)n2+ complexes. These new restraints were derived from Mn2+-induced paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) using
the ratio of signal intensity (I0/IMn) determined from 2D spectra collected at
0 μM MnCl2 (I0) and 10
μM MnCl2 (IMn). For each
signal in these spectra with I0/IMn ≥ 8-fold and 4 ≤ I0/IMn &lt; 8-fold, distance
restraints were set to 1.8–7.0 and 1.8–8.0 Å, respectively,
between a defined Mg2+ center and the nuclei giving rise
to the observed signal ( of ). When the identity of
the Mg2+ center could not be defined, ambiguous metal restraints
were defined with bounds of 1.8–10.0 Å ( of ). Restraints were also derived from Cd2+-induced 31P CSP of the sulfur-bound phosphorus from phosphorothioate
SLVI RNAs [ΔP = (δMg – δCd)] calculated from 1D 31P spectra collected in
5 mM MgCl2 (δMg) and 0.25 mM CdCl2/4.75 mM MgCl2 (δCd). Phosphorothioates
with ΔP ≥ 1.0 ppm were considered as inner-sphere
ligands, and a distance constraint of 1.8–2.2 Å was defined
between a Mg2+ center and the modified nonbridging phosphate
oxygen. Each phosphorothioate with 0.2 &lt; ΔP &lt;
1.0 ppm was considered as an outer-sphere ligand, and a distance restraint
of 1.8–7.0 Å was defined between a Mg2+ center
and the modified nonbridging phosphate oxygen. On the basis of a clustering
analysis of the nuclei that were most affected by Mn2+-induced
PRE (I0/IMn ≥ 8-fold) and Cd2+-induced CSP of phosphorothioates
(ΔP &gt; 0.2 ppm), we inferred five distinct Mg2+-binding sites for SLVI, termed sites 1–5, including
two pentahydrated Mg2+-ion complexes [Mg(H2O)52+; sites 1 and 3] and three fully hydrated Mg2+-ion complexes [Mg(H2O)62+; sites 2, 4, and 5].

Three-dimensional structures of SLVI
with bound Mg(H2O)n2+ complexes were calculated by restraining molecular dynamics and
simulated annealing with X-PLOR-NIH version 2.1.9 by adapting the two-stage protocol previously used for
structure determination of free SLVI. At stage one, an initial set of structures was calculated from RNA
structures with randomized backbone angles to which Mg(H2O)n2+ coordinates and parameters
derived from HIC-Up were added. Several
rounds of calculations were performed at this stage to allow stepwise
incorporation of restraints to metal-ion complexes. At the end of
stage one, 50 structures were obtained that satisfy all distance and
dihedral experimental restraints (no distance violation of &gt;0.2
Å
and no torsion angle violation of &gt;5°), including all of those
involving the five metal complexes. At stage two, these structures
were refined with the same set of restraints but were supplemented
with RDC restraints. A final set of 500
structures was calculated, from which the 20 lowest-energy structures
that satisfied the experimental restraints (no distance violation
&gt;0.2 Å, no torsion angle violation &gt;5°, and no RDC
violation
&gt;5 Hz) were selected for analysis. These 20 lowest-energy structures
were used to calculate an average structure that was minimized against
NOE and dihedral restraints. All structures were visualized and analyzed
with PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3 Schrödinger,
LLC.

Pattern Search of RNA Metal-Binding Motifs in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB)
Metal-binding motifs similar to those found in
SLVI were searched in all available X-ray, cryo-EM, and NMR structures
of the PDB using WebFR3D. The search
patterns were defined according to their sequential and structural
context in SLVI using the FR3D symbolic search algorithm. For each
search, the results were extracted from the FR3D html file (raw hits)
and filtered to remove the PDB files that did not contain metal ions.
For each resulting hit (hit with a cation), a heavy-atom superposition
of the nucleotides defining the search pattern was obtained between
the PDB coordinates of the hit and the SLVI average structure, and
this superposition was used to extract a pairwise heavy-atom rmsd.
In cases where residues used for the superposition differ, the base
of these residues was omitted for the superposition and rmsd calculation.
The superposition was also used to extract the distance between the
divalent metal ions of the two structures. For each FR3D search, those
structures with metal distances smaller than 4.5 Å were termed
positive hits and kept for further analysis.

Results
Probing Divalent
Metal-Ion-Binding Sites in SLVI through Mn2+-Induced Paramagnetic
Relaxation Enhancement (PRE)
To identify metal-ion-binding
sites in the SLVI RNA (Figure B), we performed
several Mn2+ titrations
and monitored them by NMR spectroscopy. Mn2+ is a paramagnetic
metal ion that specifically enhances the relaxation of nuclei located
within a short distance range (∼10 Å). The PRE is proportional to r–6 and can be used to derive distance (r) restraints
between the Mn2+ and the observed nuclei. Thus, Mn2+-induced PRE represents a common approach
for identifying divalent metal-ion-binding sites in RNA.,−

Most of the previously assigned 1H, 13C, and 15N signals in SLVI were probed using 2D 1H–13C and 1H–15N correlation
experiments recorded during the titration of 0–80 μM
MnCl2 to an SLVI RNA folded in 5 mM MgCl2. The
high concentration of Mg2+ is necessary for proper RNA
folding, whereas a ∼1000-fold lower concentration of Mn2+ is sufficient for specific binding of the paramagnetic ion
in the fast-exchange regime.,, At 10 μM MnCl2, the relaxation of several nuclei
in SLVI is specifically affected, as shown for aromatic signals of
the 2D 1H–13C CT-HSQC spectrum (Figure A,B) that either become significantly less intense
(G13) or completely disappear (G1, G3, G6, G9, C12, G19, G22, and G23). For each well-resolved signal in this
and other 2D spectra, the signal intensity was measured in the absence
(I0) and presence of 10 μM Mn2+ (IMn) to calculate a disappearance
ratio (I0/IMn). Interestingly, the signals that undergo the strongest decrease
in intensity (I0/IMn ≥ 8) correspond to 1H, 13C,
and 15N nuclei that are dispersed throughout the RNA (Figure C and  of the ). Thus, the results from
Mn2+-induced PRE are compatible with several divalent-metal-binding
sites in SLVI. The precise localization of these binding sites is,
however, not possible at this stage because specific phosphates involved
in metal binding could not be identified from Mn2+-induced
PRE as a result of the severe 31P spectral overlap and
the lack of specific 31P assignment.

Probing divalent-metal-ion-binding
sites in SLVI through Mn2+-induced PRE. The effect of Mn2+ ions on the relaxation
of SLVI nuclei is shown for aromatic (C6–H6 and C8–H8)
signals by comparing the 2D 1H–13C HSQC
spectra of SLVI RNA collected in (A) the absence and (B) the presence
of 10 μM MnCl2. Peaks that disappeared below the
noise level are denoted with empty ovals. (C) Summary of the effect
of Mn2+ ions on the relaxation of SLVI nuclei mapped on

large (I0/IMn ≥ 8-fold) and medium (4 ≤ I0/IMn &lt; 8-fold) PRE. Different symbols
are used to distinguish PRE of imino and amino N–H signals
(squares), N7, N9, and N3 signals (circles), aromatic C–H signals
(stars), and ribose C–H signals (diamonds).

Identification of Phosphate–Metal
Interactions by Cd2+-Induced 31P Chemical-Shift
Perturbation (CSP)
of Phosphorothioate RNAs
A phosphorothioate RNA contains
a modification that substitutes either the pro-Rp or the pro-Sp nonbonded phosphate
oxygen (pro-Rp/Sp OP) by a sulfur atom and significantly
alters the chemical shift of the associated 31P signal
such that it can be easily identified in a 1D 31P NMR spectrum.− Because phosphorothioates prefer thiophilic metal ions, like Cd2+, over Mg2+ ions, formation of phosphorothioate–metal
complexes can be monitored by recording 1D 31P NMR spectra
during Cd2+ titration., Chemical-shift
perturbations (CSP) of the sulfur-bound phosphorus have been associated
with coordination of Cd2+ ions, with large upfield shifts
being characteristic of inner-sphere coordination.,

To investigate the contribution of phosphates to metal coordination,
several SLVI RNAs containing single phosphorothioate modifications
were prepared (Figure B). Phosphorothioate
modifications of C7, A8, G9, and
C10 are of particular interest to examine metal binding
in the S-turn of SLVI. In addition, modification of A15 provides a positive control because an inner-sphere metal contact
has been previously reported at this position of a GAAA tetraloop, and modification of C24 provides
a negative control because this residue is not predicted to interact
with a metal ion. The phosphorothioate RNAs were prepared by chemical
synthesis as mixtures of pro-Rp and pro-Sp isomers, and reverse-phase HPLC was used
to separate the individual isomers. SLVI RNAs with a 5′-phosphorothioate
at a specific residue N are denoted as either N-Rp or N-Sp. With the exception of the C24-Rp/Sp mixture, all of the individual isomers were separated from their
mixtures in high purity.

The Cd2+-titration conditions
were carefully defined
to prevent Cd2+-induced structural changes in SLVI and/or
RNA aggregation that may result from an excess of Cd2+ ions., We first collected 2D 1H–13C CT-HSQC
spectra of a 0.2 mM 13C/15N-labeled SLVI RNA
sample in the presence of increasing Cd2+ concentrations.
Only small changes in chemical shifts were observed between 0 and
0.25 mM of Cd2+, suggesting that the SLVI structure remains
essentially intact. However, significant CSP are observed at Cd2+ concentrations ≥1.0 mM ( of the ), which indicates that the SLVI structure is significantly modified
by high Cd2+/RNA ratios. In addition, high Cd2+ concentrations cause smearing of SLVI on native gels (at 4 mM Cd2+; not shown) and a change in the shape of the UV melting
curves (at 1.5 mM Cd2+; not shown), in agreement with aggregation
of SLVI under these conditions.

To preserve the structural integrity
of SLVI, Cd2+ titrations
of phosphorothioate RNAs were thus performed at low Cd2+/RNA ratios. These titrations were monitored by 1D 31P
spectra (Figure ), and CSP of the sulfur-bound
phosphorus was determined for each phosphorothioate RNA using ΔP = (δMg – δCd), where
δMg = chemical shift (δ) at 5 mM MgCl2 and δCd = δ at 4.75 mM MgCl2/0.25
mM CdCl2 (Table ). A large CSP
(ΔP ≥ 1.0 ppm) was detected for the A15-Sp phosphorothioate (ΔP = 1.43
ppm; Figure A and Table ), as was previously observed for an equivalent phosphorothioate
of a GAAA tetraloop involved in an inner-sphere metal coordination. Similarly, the large CSP associated with the
G9-Rp phosphorothioate (ΔP = 1.62 ppm; Figure B and Table ) provides evidence for inner-sphere metal coordination
at the nonbridging G9pro-Rp phosphate oxygen. Smaller but still significant CSP (0.2 &lt; ΔP &lt; 1.0 ppm) for seven other phosphorothioates (C7-Rp/Sp, A8-Rp/Sp, G9-Sp, C10-Rp, and A15-Rp; Figure ,  of the , and Table ) are compatible with outer-sphere metal coordination. Finally,
the C10-Sp and C24-Rp/Sp phosphorothioates
display small CSP (ΔP &lt; 0.2 ppm;  of the  and Table ), as is expected for those not
involved in divalent metal coordination.

Effect of Cd2+ ions on the 1D 31P NMR spectrum
of selected SLVI RNAs containing single phosphorothioate modifications.
The 1D 31P spectra of (A) A15-Sp and A15-Rp, (B) G9-Sp and G9-Rp, and (C) A8-Sp and A8-Rp were collected in buffer containing
CdCl2/MgCl2 concentrations of 0.0:5.0, 0.0625:4.9375,
0.125:4.875, and 0.25:4.75 mM. Only the most downfield region of the
spectra containing the signal from the phosphorothioate is shown.

Previous reports have indicated
that phosphorothioate modifications
may affect RNA structure by inducing distortions in the sugar–phosphate
backbone;, thus, control experiments were performed
to verify that they have a minimal effect on the structure of SLVI.
First, 1D 1H imino NMR spectra were collected as part of
the Cd2+ titration of phosphorothioate SLVI RNAs, and these
spectra are all very similar to that of the unmodified SLVI ( of the ), suggesting that the phosphorothioate modifications
do not significantly affect the global structure of SLVI. In addition,
melting temperatures (Tm) were determined
for each phosphorothioate RNA by UV–vis spectroscopy (Table ). Generally, the observed Tm values of the phosphorothioate SLVI RNAs (Table ) are very similar to that of the unmodified SLVI
(74.6 ± 0.1 °C), further supporting that these modifications
do not alter the structural integrity of the RNA. However, significant
differences in Tm values are noted for
two phosphorothioate RNAs. The Tm value
for the A15-Rp phosphorothioate (82.5 ± 0.1 °C)
is 8 °C higher than that of the unmodified SLVI RNA, similar
to what was previously observed for an equivalent residue in a GAAA
hairpin loop. In contrast, the Tm value for the C7-Rp phosphorothioate
RNA (64.6 ± 1.1 °C) is 10 °C lower than that of the
unmodified SLVI RNA, indicating that this particular modification
destabilizes SLVI. Given the position of the C7 5′-PO4– in the S-turn, the destabilizing effect of the C7-Rp phosphorothioate
modification could be due to a perturbed divalent metal coordination
involving the modified atom. To investigate this possibility, Tm values were obtained in the presence of 0.25
mM Cd2+/4.75 mM Mg2+ (Table ). Interestingly, although this Cd2+-containing
buffer does not affect the stability of the unmodified SLVI RNA (Tm = 74.6 ± 0.2), it restores the stability
of the C7-Rp phosphorothioate RNA (Tm = 73.5 ± 0.2), implying that the modified position is
involved in metal coordination. Consequently, these controls support
the validity of the Cd2+-titration results, at least in
terms of inferring specific phosphate–metal interactions in
SLVI.

Structural Modeling of SLVI with Mg(H2O)n2+ Complexes
Three-dimensional
NMR structures of SLVI bound to Mg(H2O)n2+ complexes (SLVIMg) were determined
as previously reported for free SLVI (SLVIfree), with the addition of Mg2+-RNA distance
restraints derived from the Mn2+-induced PRE ( of the ) and the Cd2+-induced CSP of phosphorothioate
RNAs (Table ). Five Mg(H2O)n2+ binding sites (sites 1–5)
were defined by circumscribing into separate clusters atoms that were
most affected by the Mn2+ and Cd2+ titrations.
Metal complexes at sites 2, 4, and 5 were modeled as hexahydrated
Mg2+ complexes [Mg(H2O)62+], whereas those at sites 1 and 3 were modeled as pentahydrated Mg2+ complexes [Mg(H2O)52+],
given the evidence for inner-sphere metal coordination of the 5′-PO4– of A15 and G9 (Table ). The resulting 20 lowest-energy structures of
SLVIMg (Table ) are compatible
with all of the experimental restraints, indicating that the new Mg2+–RNA restraints are fully consistent with distance,
dihedral, and RDC restraints defined for structure determination of
the SLVIfree RNA. The NMR
structure of SLVIMg is very well-defined with an overall
heavy-atom rmsd of 0.33 ± 0.14 Å (Table ). Thus, the ensemble of SLVIMg structures is well-represented
by the minimized average structure (Figure ). By comparison, the NMR structure of SLVIfree was previously
determined with an overall heavy-atom rmsd of 0.67 ± 0.17 Å, indicating that the new Mg2+–RNA
restraints help to define better the SLVI structure.

Lowest-energy
structure of the SLVI RNA determined in the presence
of Mg(H2O)n2+ complexes.
The five Mg2+ ions associated with SLVI are shown (black),
but their bound water molecules were omitted for clarity. For SLVI,
only the heavy atoms are shown, and the ribbon replacing the phosphorus
and the nonbonded oxygen atoms is used to show the backbone. SLVI
nucleotides are color-coded: the loop-closing base pairs (G6-C21 and C10-G19) are dark gray,
C7 (C755) is magenta, A8 (A756) is green, G9 (G757) is gold, and A20 (A730) is blue.

The structure of SLVIMg reveals five well-defined
Mg2+-binding sites. The three outer-sphere metal-binding
sites,
sites 2, 4, and 5, are all located in the major groove of SLVI (Figure  and Table ). Site 2 is
located in the hairpin stem near the C10 5′-PO4– of the S-turn (Figure A), where G17 O6, U18 O4, and G19 O6 act as potential outer-sphere ligands and C10 5′-PO4– likely contributes to
electrostatic stabilization. Site 4 is associated with the U5–G22 wobble base within the 5′–3′
stem (Figure B), with U5 O4, G22 O6/N7/5′-pro-Rp OP, and
G23 O6/N7 acting as potential outer-sphere ligands and
G22 5′-PO4– ensuring
electrostatic stabilization. Interestingly, the Mg(H2O)62+ complex at site 4 also interacts with the base
of C21, forming a cation−π interaction. The
Mg(H2O)62+ complex at site 5 is found
at the extremity of the 5′–3′ stem (Figure C), close enough to G1 O5′/N7/O6,
A2 N7/5′-pro-Rp OP,
and G3 O6/N7 for outer-sphere coordination and to the 5′-PO4– of A2 and G3 for
electrostatic stabilization. For site 5, the position of the Mg(H2O)62+ complex is not as well-defined
as for sites 2 and 4 by the NMR data (Figure ), indicating that metal coordination may be undergoing dynamic exchange
of ligands.

Mg(H2O)62+-binding sites associated

a superposition of the 10 lowest-energy structures (left panel) and
the lowest-energy structure (right panel) are shown. The Mg2+ ions are shown in black, with their bound water molecules in white.

Inner-sphere ligands were determined
from Cd2+-induced CSP (ΔP &gt; 1.0 ppm).

Outer-sphere ligands were determined
by selecting all hydrogen-bond acceptors within 4.0 Å of a Mg(H2O)n2+ oxygen that were
in a favorable orientation for outer-sphere interaction in at least
5 of the 20 lowest-energy structures.

Electrostatic interactions were
determined by selecting 5′-PO4– within 8.0 Å of a Mg2+ ion.

Cation−π interactions
were determined for Mg2+ ions within 5.2 Å and at
an angle smaller than 52° from the ring centroid.

The
two inner-sphere metal-binding sites, sites 1 and 3 (Figure ), are formed by unique structural elements within
SLVI that contain electronegative pockets rich in phosphate oxygens,
with one of the phosphates involved in inner-sphere metal coordination
(A15 5′-pro-Sp OP at
site 1 and G9 5′- pro-Rp OP at site 3; Table ). Site 1 within the
G13A14A15A16 tetraloop
also utilizes three potential outer-sphere ligands identified as A15 O5′/5′-pro-Rp OP
and A16 5′-pro-Rp OP
(Table ). Remarkably, the Mg(H2O)52+ at site 1 is positioned on one face of
the G13 base, forming a cation−π interaction
(Figure A). Site
3 also involves several potential outer-sphere ligands identified
as C7 O3′/O5′/5′-pro-Rp OP, A8 O5′/5′-pro-Rp OP, and G9 O5′ (Table ). Moreover, site 3 is unique in that the 5′-PO4– of C7, A8, and G9 within the S-turn form an electronegative cluster resembling
a three-prong mount that holds the Mg(H2O)52+ complex (Figure B).

structures (left panel) and the lowest-energy structure (right panel)
are shown. Blue dotted lines represent inner-sphere metal binding

in panel A and the G9pro-Rp OP in panel B. The Mg2+ ions are shown in black, with
their bound water molecules in white.

Search for Metal-Binding Motifs in the PDB
To complement
our NMR study of metal-binding sites in SLVI, we used the WebFR3D
symbolic search algorithm to find similar
metal-binding sites in the PDB. The search patterns correspond to
sites 1–5 (Figure ), as summarized
in  of the . Positive hits from this search fit
the search pattern and also contain a metal ion that is within 4.5
Å of that found for the same motif in SLVI.

For the GNRA
motif in SLVI (site 1), the search pattern was defined by the consecutive
CGNRAG sequence (N is an undefined nucleotide and R is a purine),
with the first and last nucleotides forming a Watson–Crick
base pair. The search resulted in three positive hits with pairwise
heavy-atom rmsd values and metal distances to the SLVI average structure
of 1.0–1.3 and 0.7–4.1 Å, respectively (Figure A). All of these motifs adopt a GNRA tetraloop fold
with a metal ion in the minor groove interacting with the 5′-PO4– corresponding to that of A15 in SLVI, although this interaction does not involve inner-sphere
coordination as observed for SLVI. Remarkably, in all cases, the metal
ion forms a cation−π interaction with the conserved G
nucleobase of the motif.

Superposition of metal-binding sites in SLVI
with PDB structures
containing similar metal-binding sites identified using WebFR3D. The
metal-binding sites in SLVI are associated with the (A) GNRA hairpin
loop (site 1), (B) C10 5′-PO4– (site 2), (C) G22–U5 wobble (site 4),
and (D) 5′ end (site 5). The structure and Mg2+ ions
of SLVI are shown in black, whereas the other structures (PDB entries
in  of ) are shown in gray, with their associated metal
ion color coded according to the type of metal (Mg2+, green;
Na+, purple; Co3+, red; Ca2+, blue;
Ni2+, yellow; and Ir3+; light blue).

For site 2, the search pattern corresponds to a
3 bp helical domain
that matches the exact sequence of the first three base pairs of the
hairpin stem (C10-C12/G17-G19). The search resulted in eight positive hits, with pairwise heavy-atom
rmsd values and metal distances to the SLVI average structure of 0.6–1.1
and 1.6–3.4 Å, respectively (Figure B). From the superposition of the eight positive hits to the average
SLVI structure, it is clear that the associated metal ions always
lie in the major groove, although they occupy several different locations
within this ensemble of structures.

For the S-turn motif (site
3), two search patterns were defined
from the A730 loop sequence ( of
the ); however, only
one raw hit (i.e., without metal) was obtained corresponding to the
previously determined SLVI structure.

For the G–U base pair in SLVI (site 4), the search
pattern
was defined as a helical domain with three Watson–Crick base
pairs corresponding to nucleotides C4-G6/C21-G23 in SLVI. This search resulted in three positive
hits with pairwise heavy-atom rmsd values and metal distances to the
SLVI average structure of 1.0–1.9 and 1.5–2.0 Å,
respectively (Figure C). In one case (PDB
code 1FJG),
the divalent metal ion forms a cation−π interaction with
a cytidine.

For the purine stretch
at the 5′ end of the helix (site
5), the search pattern corresponds to a 3 bp helical domain that matches
the exact sequence of the three first base pairs in SLVI (G1-G3/C24-C26). The search resulted
in 16 positive hits with pairwise heavy-atom rmsd values and metal
distances to the SLVI average structure of 0.4–1.1 and 1.7–4.0
Å, respectively (Figure D). From the
superposition of the 16 positive hits to the average SLVI structure,
it is clear that the associated metal ions lie in the major groove,
although they occupy a variety of different locations in these structures.

Discussion
Powerful NMR Approach for Localization of Divalent Metal-Binding
Sites in RNA
The present work highlights the strength of
combining Mn2+-induced PRE experiments and Cd2+-induced CSP of phosphorothioate RNAs to localize divalent-cation-binding
sites in RNA. Mn2+-induced PRE experiments have been widely
used to probe RNA structures and to define metal-binding sites,,,, and can provide a large number of RNA–metal
restraints, especially for 1H, 13C, and 15N atoms of 13C/15N-labeled RNAs. However,
Cd2+-induced CSP of phosphorothioate RNAs identifies specific
metal–phosphate interactions and provides information on the
coordination state of the associated metal ions.,,− Thus, these two approaches
are complementary, and together they provide a large number of nonredundant
experimental restraints to define precisely metal-ion binding in the
SLVI RNA. An important consideration in using this dual approach is
ensuring that the different metal ions and chemically modified RNAs
employed do not affect the structural integrity of the RNA. Importantly,
the two metal ions used, Mn2+ and Cd2+, both
support the catalytic activity of the VS ribozyme and thus likely
the correct folding at the active site.,, In addition, experimental controls were performed
to ensure reliable measurement of distance restraints between the
RNA and the associated divalent metals. Overall, the distance restraints
derived from these data help to define better the structure of SLVI
and to allow the localization of five well-defined divalent metal-binding
sites in the major groove of the RNA. One of the metal-binding sites
is specific to the S-turn of the A730 loop of SLVI, whereas the other
four are commonly found in other RNAs. Thus, the NMR structure of
SLVI with bound divalent cations provides valuable insights into both
our general understanding of RNA–metal interactions and the
cation requirement for formation of the VS ribozyme active site.

New Insights about Known Cation-Binding Sites in RNA
According
to our FR3D search, four of the five metal-binding sites
in SLVI have been previously observed in similar RNA structures. Two
of these sites (sites 2 and 5) bind a hexahydrated Mg2+ ion within the major groove of A-form helical stems formed by standard
Watson–Crick base pairs. The site located at the 5′
end of SLVI (site 5) is formed by three consecutives purines. This
site offers a favorable environment for cations because of the presence
of several electronegative groups associated with the 5′-GAG-3′
sequence. This metal-binding site is not as well-defined by the NMR
data as other sites in SLVI, suggesting that more than one coordination
mode are possible and that diffuse binding may occur along the purine
stretch. Using FR3D, we identified 16 similar metal-binding sites
in purine patches with the same sequence and structure context. The
location of the metal is also not well-defined within these metal-binding
sites, further supporting that the major groove of consecutive purines
represents a common metal-binding site in double-stranded RNA that
allows diffuse binding over the Hoogsteen edge of these purines.,, In contrast, the binding of a
Mg2+ ion within the hairpin stem at site 2 is better defined,
with the base keto-oxygens of the 5′-GUG-3′ sequence
and the pro-Rp OP of the C10 5′-PO4– as potential outer-sphere
ligands. Using FR3D, we identified eight similar sites in the PDB,
and the location of the metal ion is more clearly defined within these
available structures than for the 5′-GAG-3′ site, indicating
fewer modes of metal coordination at the 5′-GUG-3′ site.
These results also point out sequence-dependent variations in cation
binding within the major groove of A-form RNA helices.

G–U
wobble pairs are well-known metal-binding sites that form depending
on the sequence and structure context.,,,− In SLVI, a metal ion is associated with the G22–U5 base pair in the 5′–3′ stem near the
A730 loop (site 4). The Hoogsteen edges of G22 and G23 are mainly involved in the interaction with the hexahydrated
Mg2+ ion, in agreement with previous studies. In the structure
of SLVI, a cation−π interaction is also observed between
the Mg2+ ion and the C21 nucleobase. To our knowledge, this interaction has not been
previously associated with a G–U wobble pair. Using FR3D, we
found three similar structures in the PDB. Interestingly, in one of
these three structures (PDB entry 1FJG), the bound
metal ion also forms a cation−π interaction with a cytidine.
In this case, however, the metal ion is located further from the center
of the base and has a larger angle with the centroid of the nucleobase,
suggesting a weaker cation−π interaction. In SLVI, the
nearby A730 loop may render C21 more accessible for a cation−π
interaction with the Mg2+ ion. However, given that the
G–U pair is found in a different context in SLVI versus the
full-length VS ribozyme, it is not clear if Mg2+ binding
at this site is relevant to the activity of the ribozyme.

The
GNRA tetraloop has been extensively characterized as a metal-binding
site.,,− In the context of the present study, the GAAA loop of SLVI was used
as a positive control because an inner-sphere divalent-metal interaction
involving the 5′-PO4– of A15 was previously identified in an equivalent position of a
GAAA hairpin on the basis of Cd2+ titration of phosphorothioates. These NMR results were essentially reproduced
here for the GNRA loop of SLVI. In addition, we identified a cation−π
interaction in the SLVI structure between the Mg2+ ion
and the pyrimidine ring of the first G nucleobase of the GNRA loop.
The importance of this cation−π interaction in the GNRA
fold has not been previously established, at least to our knowledge;
therefore, it is interesting to examine cation binding to other GNRA
loop structures in the PDB. Using FR3D, we identified three other
similar GNRA loop structures associated with a cation. Remarkably,
although the precise location of the cation differs between these
structures, it always interacts with the R 5′-PO4– and forms a cation−π interaction
with the conserved G nucleobase.

Cation-Binding Site in
the A730 Loop Is Important for the Activity
of the VS Ribozyme
From previous NMR studies, we established
that the presence of Mg2+ ions is required for the formation
of a stable A730 loop. It is now clear that binding of a specific
Mg2+ ion at the S-turn (site 3) is central to the folding
of the A730 loop. This S-turn brings
three phosphate groups in proximity to one another [5′-PO4– of C7 (C755), A8 (A756), and G9 (G757)] with
particularly short OP–OP distances between G9 and
C7 and between G9 and A8 (4.1 and
5.1 Å, respectively, in the average structure). This tight packing
of repulsive electronegative charges is dependent on the multidentate
chelation of a Mg2+ ion, which involves an inner-shell
ligand [5′-pro-Rp OP of G9 (G757)] and several potential outer-sphere ligands. Although
our FR3D search indicates that there is no precedent for a S-turn
structure in a similar loop context, the S-turn motif is found in
other structural contexts, both with or without a divalent cation.,− With the A730 loop being relatively small, this clearly imposes
topological and electrostatic constraints on the phosphate backbone
at the S-turn that prevents stable folding in the absence of metal
ions.

In previous work with the VS ribozyme, phosphorothioate
interference and manganese-rescue experiments suggested that the pro-Rp OP of G757 (G9)
and C758 (C10) are involved in direct metal
binding and that the phosphate group of C755 (C7) makes an outer-sphere contact to a metal ion or participates in
hydrogen bonding., The NMR studies of SLVI reveal
an outer-sphere metal contact for C755 (C7) pro-Rp OP and an inner-sphere metal contact for
G757 (G9) pro-Rp OP, in agreement with the biochemical studies. For C758 (C10), the NMR studies reveal
an outer-sphere contact to a Mg2+ ion but not the predicted
inner-sphere contact. Within SLVI, the
C758 5′-PO4– may partially
contribute to stabilization of the S-turn via an outer-sphere interaction
with a Mg2+ ion in the hairpin stem. However, within the
context of the VS ribozyme, this metal interaction may be modified
because of nearby elements of secondary and tertiary structures, including
formation of the active site between stem-loops I and VI. In summary,
our NMR studies of SLVI generally agree with phosphorothioate interference
of VS ribozyme cleavage, which indicates that the Mg2+-dependent
S-turn in the A730 loop is essential for catalysis by the VS ribozyme.

The Mg2+ ion at the S-turn
plays a structural role in
catalysis by the VS ribozyme by allowing the folding of the S-turn
in the A730 loop and enabling A756 to be extruded in the
minor groove to participate as a general acid in catalysis. In the hairpin ribozyme, which catalyzes phosphodiester-bond
cleavage by a similar mechanism, the
proposed general acid in the reaction (A38) also protrudes
from an S-turn structure that is stabilized by at least two divalent
cations., Although these cations do not
play a direct role in the cleavage mechanism, they may contribute
either through electrostatic stabilization or by modulating the pKa of functional residues., In the VS ribozyme, it is also unlikely that the Mg2+ ion at the S-turn plays a direct role in catalysis, given that its
binding site is remote from the scissile phosphate in a model of the
VS ribozyme active site. Nevertheless,
given that this Mg2+ ion is not too distant from the catalytic
site, we can not rule out the possibility that it contributes to the
chemistry of the reaction. It is known that the pKa value of the A756 and the G638 nucleobases are shifted toward neutrality to facilitate the cleavage
reaction,,− and that the pKa of these nucleobases
is modulated by the identity of the metal cation. Thus, the Mg2+ ion in the A730 loop clearly
plays a structural role in defining the VS ribozyme active site, but
it also likely contributes indirectly to the general acid–base
chemistry.
