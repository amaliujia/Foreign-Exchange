Lactimidomycin (LTM, 1) and iso-migrastatin (iso-MGS, 2) belong to the glutarimide-containing
polyketide family
of natural products. We previously cloned and characterized the mgs biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces
platensis NRRL 18993. The iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery
featured an acyltransferase (AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS)
and three tailoring enzymes (MgsIJK). We now report cloning and characterization
of the ltm biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964, which consists of
nine genes that encode an AT-less type I PKS (LtmBCDEFGHL) and one
tailoring enzyme (LtmK). Inactivation of ltmE or ltmH afforded the mutant strain SB15001 or SB15002, respectively,
that abolished the production of 1, as well as the three
cometabolites 8,9-dihydro-LTM (14), 8,9-dihydro-8S-hydroxy-LTM (15), and 8,9-dihydro-9R-hydroxy-LTM (13). Inactivation of ltmK yielded the mutant strain SB15003 that abolished the
production of 1, 13, and 15 but led to the accumulation of 14. Complementation
of the ΔltmK mutation in SB15003 by expressing ltmK in trans restored the production of 1,
as well as that of 13 and 15. These results
support the model for 1 biosynthesis, featuring an AT-less
type I PKS that synthesizes 14 as the nascent polyketide
intermediate and a cytochrome P450 desaturase that converts 14 to 1, with 13 and 15 as minor cometabolites. Comparative analysis of the LTM and iso-MGS
AT-less type I PKSs revealed several unusual features that deviate
from those of the collinear type I PKS model. Exploitation of the
tailoring enzymes for 1 and 2 biosynthesis
afforded two analogues, 8,9-dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM
(16) and 8,9-dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM
(17), that provided new insights into the structure–activity
relationship of 1 and 2. While 12-membered
macrolides, featuring a combination of a hydroxyl group at C-17 and
a double bond at C-8 and C-9 as found in 1, exhibit the
most potent activity, analogues with a single hydroxyl or methoxy
group at C-8 or C-9 retain most of the activity whereas analogues
with double substitutions at C-8 and C-9 lose significant activity.

Lactimidomycin
(LTM, 1) belongs to the glutarimide-containing polyketide
family of natural
products.1,2 Other members of this family include iso-migrastatin
(iso-MGS, 2), migrastatin (MGS, 3), the
dorrigocins (DGNs, 4–6), NK30424A and -B (7 and 8, respectively), the streptimidones (9 and 10), and cycloheximide (11) (Figure 1). Originally, 1 was
isolated from Streptomyces amphibiosporus ATCC 53964
for its potent cytotoxicity activity against various tumor cells;33 was isolated in Streptomyces sp. MK929-43F1 for its modest tumor cell migration inhibitory activity,4,5 and 4–6 were isolated from Streptomyces
platensis NRRL 18993 as inhibitors of carboxyl methyltransferases
involved in the processing of Ras-related proteins.6,7 Fermentation
optimization subsequently resulted in the isolation of 2 from S. platensis NRRL 18993.8 Identical to the cysteine adducts of 2,17 and 8 were first
isolated from Streptomyces sp. NA30424 for their
ability to inhibit PLS-induced TNF-α production by suppressing
the NF-κB signaling pathway.9 Mostly
known for their antifungal activity, 9 and 10 have been isolated from various Streptomyces species.10,11 Finally, best known as an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein translation, 11 was first isolated from Streptomyces griseus and has since been isolated from numerous Streptomyces species.12−14

53964, (B) selected
members of the glutarimide-containing polyketide family of natural
products (2–11), and (C) engineered glutarimide-containing
polyketides (16 and 17) bearing structural

Table 2.

Among the multitude of activities exhibited by the glutarimide-containing
polyketides, the tumor cell migration inhibitory activity of 3 and the protein translation initiation inhibitory activity
of 1 have by far most captured the interests of biologists
and chemists.1,2 Accordingly, synthetic analogues
of the 14-membered macrolide 3 have been prepared, some
with cell migration inhibitory activity ∼3 orders of magnitude
greater than that of the natural product, which have been pursued
as therapeutic candidates for treating tumor metastasis.15−17 A focused library of glutarimide-containing polyketides has been
isolated from optimized fermentations of S. platensis NRRL 18993 and S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53694, and
preliminary evaluation of these revealed that 12-membered macrolides,
as exemplified by 1 and 2, were also potent
inhibitors of tumor cell migration.1,2,18−20 While the exact modes of action
that dictate and differentiate cell migration inhibition from cytotoxicity
for the glutarimide-containing polyketides remain controversial, the
actin-bundling protein fascin has been identified as the target for
the cell migration inhibitory activity of 3,21 and blocking the translocation step in eukaryotic
protein translation initiation has been deduced as the mechanism for
the cytotoxicity of 1.22−24 The latter property
of 1, in contrast to 11 that blocks the
translocation steps in protein translation elongation, has been exploited
in the development of the Global Translation Initiation Sequencing
(GTI-seq) technology that allows high-resolution mapping of translation
initiation sites across the entire transcriptome.23,24 Small molecule inhibitors of protein translation have also shown
promise as potential chemotherapeutic agents for treating cancers.25

We have previously reported that 2 is the true natural
product of S. platensis NRRL 18993, and 3–6 are degradation products of 2 that occur during isolation,
which can be readily derived from 2 via a facile, H2O-mediated ring expansion or ring-opening rearrangement (Figure
S1 of the Supporting Information).26 We subsequently cloned and characterized the mgs biosynthetic gene cluster from S. platensis NRRL 18993 and confirmed 2 as the final product of
the iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery, which featured an acyltransferase
(AT)-less type I polyketide synthase (PKS) and three tailoring enzymes.27 We have recently revealed that the iso-MGS AT-less
type I PKS produces two nascent polyketide intermediates, 16,17-didehydro-8-desmethoxy-iso-MGS
(12) and 17R-hydroxy-8-desmethoxy-iso-MGS
(13). Further, the biosynthesis of 12 and 13 involves several unusual features that deviate from those
of the collinear type I PKS model, and the three tailoring enzymes
possess remarkable substrate promiscuity, accounting for the formation
of all congeners of 2 known to S. platensis NRRL 18993 from 12 and 13 (Figure S2 of
the Supporting Information).28

We have also optimized the fermentation
of S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 and isolated, in
addition to 1, three LTM
congeners, 8,9-dihydo-LTM (14), 8,9-dihydro-8S-hydroxy-LTM (15), and 8,9-dihydro-9R-hydroxy-LTM (13) (Figure 1A),18 the latter of which is identical
to 17R-hydroxy-8-desmethoxy-iso-MGS (13), one of the two nascent polyketide intermediates synthesized by
the iso-MGS AT-less type I PKS (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information).27,28 The structural
similarity, with distinct variations, between 1 and 2, and the isolation of the same biosynthetic intermediate 13 from both producers of 1 and 2, suggest close relationships in their biosynthetic pathways.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of the ltm biosynthetic cluster from S. amphibiosporus ATCC
53964. The LTM biosynthetic machinery features an AT-less type
I PKS nearly identical to that of 2 but a rare cytochrome
P450 desaturase functioning as the sole tailoring enzyme. Comparison
of the LTM and iso-MGS biosynthetic machineries allows deduction of
a biosynthetic pathway for 1, reveals new insights into
the biosynthesis of the glutarimide-containing polyketides, and sets
the stage to investigate several unusual features common to AT-less
type I PKSs. Exploitation of the tailoring enzymes for 1 and 2 biosynthesis affords two analogues, 8,9-dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM (16) and 8,9-dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM (17), which feature the 17R-hydroxyl group present in 1 and the 8R-hydroxyl or 8R-methoxyl groups present
in 2 (Figure 1C) and provide new
insights into the structure–activity relationship (SAR) of 1 and 2.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains, Plasmids,
and Culture Conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used
are summarized in Table S1 of
the Supporting Information. S.
amphibiosporus wild-type and recombinant strains were cultivated
on ISP4 or tryptic soy broth (TSB) medium at 28 °C.29Escherichia coli strains were
grown on lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 37 °C.30 Strains carrying antibiotic resistance markers were selected
in medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/mL), apramycin
(50 μg/mL), chroramphenicol (50 μg/mL), kanamycin (50
μg/mL), nalidixic acid (20 μg/mL), thiostrepton (5 μg/mL),
or trimethoprim (50 μg/mL), where appropriate.29,30

DNA Isolation, Manipulation, and Sequencing
Standard
procedures were used to manipulate purified DNA.30 Genomic DNAs were purified from S. amphibiosporus strains using the salting out procedure.29 Plasmids were isolated using available kits (Qiagen). Cosmid DNAs
were purified by the alkaline lysis method.17 PCRs were performed using the high-fidelity Expand PCR system according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche). Oligonucleotide primers
that were used are listed in Table S2 of the Supporting
Information. Southern analysis of S. amphibiosporus genomic DNA was conducted using DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and
Detection Starter Kit I following the manufacturer’s protocol
(Roche).

Genome Scanning and Sequence Analysis
Isolation of
the ltm biosynthetic gene cluster was performed by
the genome scanning method as described previously.27,31 A SuperCos1-based library of S. amphibiosporus ATCC
53964 was constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Agilent Technologies). Three cosmids, pBS15001, pBS15002, and pBS15003,
covering the entire ltm biosynthetic gene cluster,
were identified by probing with PKS genes identified from a genome
sampling library and were sequenced (Figure 2A). The DNA sequences obtained were analyzed by the Genetic Computer
Group (GCG) program, BLAST-X, N, and P available at National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Gene Inactivation in S. amphibiosporus by λ-RED-Mediated
PCR Targeting Mutagenesis
The ltmE, ltmH, and ltmK genes, located on pBS15001
and pBS15003 (Figure 2A), were inactivated
in S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 by λ-RED-mediated
PCR targeting mutagenesis.32 Specifically
designed primers (Table S2 of the Supporting Information) were used to amplify the disruption cassette from the template
plasmid pIJ773.32 The PCR-amplified cassette
is comprised of the aac(3)IV gene, conferring apramycin
resistance, and an RK2 origin of transfer (oriT),
and is flanked by DNA sequence homologous to regions immediately upstream
and downstream of the gene to be deleted. This cassette is used to
replace the target gene on the cosmid by homologous recombination,
yielding pBS15004 (ΔltmE), pBS15005 (ΔltmK), and pBS15008 (ΔltmH) (Figure
S3 of the Supporting Information). The
resulting mutant cosmids were introduced into the S. amphibiosporus wild-type strain through intergeneric conjugation between S. amphibiosporus and E. coli S17-1.29 Exconjugants with desired double-crossover recombination
were selected on the basis of apramycin resistance and kanamycin sensitivity.
The genotype of each mutant was confirmed by Southern analysis, and
the mutants were subsequently named SB15001 (ΔltmE), SB15002 (ΔltmK), and SB15005 (ΔltmH) (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information).

Generation of the ΔltmK Complementation
Strain SB15003
A 2.5 kb SacI–MscI DNA fragment carrying ltmK was first cloned from pBS15003 into pWHM7933 as a SacI–SmaI fragment, creating pBS15006.
From there, a 3.0 kb EcoRI–HindIII fragment was purified, Klenow
treated (Roche), and ligated into the EcoRV site of pBS11016,27 in which the aac(3)IV gene
is replaced by the neo gene conferring kanamycin
resistance, affording pBS15007. Expression of ltmK in pBS15007 is under the control of the ErmE* promoter.29 pBS15007 was transformed into E. coli S17-1 and conjugated into SB15002. Exconjugants were selected on
the basis of resistance to apramycin and kanamycin, yielding SB15003
as the ΔltmK complemented strain.

Generation
of the ltmK Overexpression Strain
SB15004
pBS15007 was transformed into E. coli S17-1 and conjugated into the S. amphibiosporus wild-type strain. Exconjugants were selected on the basis of resistance
to kanamycin, yielding SB15004.

Construction of Recombinant
Strains SB15006 and SB15007 for
Production of Novel Analogues
The three genes, mgsI, mgsJ, and mgsK, encoding the
three tailoring enzymes for 2 biosynthesis were amplified
by PCR from pBS1100627 individually. The ErmE* promoter was amplified by PCR from pWHM79.33 All primers for mgsI, mgsJ, mgsK, and ErmE*
contained different restriction enzyme sites (Table S2 of the Supporting Information). The resultant PCR products
were digested accordingly and ligated sequentially into the EcoRV
and XbaI sites of pBS1101627 to yield pBS15009,
in which the expression of each of the mgsIJK genes
was under the control of ErmE* (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). pBS15009 was then digested
with either Acc65I and PmeI or Acc65I and AflII, and the resultant
fragments were Klenow treated and self-ligated to afford the expression
construct pBS15010 (for mgsK) or pBS15011 (for mgsJK), respectively. pBS15010 or pBS15011 was finally introduced
into the ΔltmK mutant strain of SB15002 by
conjugation, and exconjugates, selected on the basis of apramycin
and kanamycin resistance, afforded the recombinant strain SB15006
(i.e., ΔltmK/mgsK) or SB15007
(i.e., ΔltmK/mgsJK), respectively
(Figure S4 of the Supporting Information).

S. amphibiosporus Wild-Type and Recombinant
Strain Fermentation and Isolation and HPLC Analysis of 1 and Related Metabolites 13–15
S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 wild-type and recombinant strains
were fermented as previously described.18 Large-scale fermentation to isolate 14 from SB15002
for structural characterization was similarly conducted after incubation
in production medium for 7 days. All metabolites were isolated as
previously described, and their identities were confirmed by either
HPLC analysis in comparison with authentic standards (for 13–15) or 1H and 13C NMR analyses (for 14).18,28

Isolation and Structural Elucidation of Analogues 16 and 17
SB15006 and SB15007 strains
were grown
on ISP4 medium for sporulation, and spores were harvested and preserved
as a 20% glycerol suspension at −80 °C. Large-scale fermentations
and metabolite isolation were similarly performed as previously described.18 From a 2 L fermentation of SB15006, 15 (5.0 mg) was purified, and from a 2 L fermentation of SB15007, 15 (2.0 mg) and 16 (5.2 mg) were purified.

Cytotoxicity
Assay
The cytotoxicity assay was conducted
using the MTT method as previously described.34 Generally, cells were seeded in 96-well plates (HeLa cervical carcinoma
cells, 3000 per well; MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, 10000 per well;
and Jurkat T cell lymphoma cells, 40000 per well) and cultured in
the presence of serial dilutions of the test compound, with vehicle
as a negative control, in a 5% CO2 incubator for 4 days.
MTT reagent (Millipore CT0-A) was added (10 μL/well), and incubation
continued for 5 h. Then, 100 μL of 2-propanol with 0.04 N HCl
was added to each well, and UV absorption for each well was determined
using a Synergy II plate reader at 570 and 630 nm. Experiments were
conducted in triplicate and repeated twice. Representative dose–response
curves are shown in Figure S5 of the Supporting
Information, from which EC50 values were determined
using GraphPad Prism (Table 2).

Results
Cloning
of the ltm Biosynthetic Gene Cluster
from S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964
The ltm biosynthetic gene cluster was cloned from S.
amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 by genome scanning (Materials and Methods).31 Genome
scanning and sequence analysis of a 100 kb DNA region from S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 revealed a gene cluster that
is highly conserved with the mgs gene cluster of S. platensis NRRL 18993 (Figure 2A and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). The putative ltm cluster was covered by three
overlapping cosmids, pBS15001, pBS15002, and pBS15003. Construction
of the SB15001 (ΔltmE), SB15005 (ΔltmH), and SB15002 (ΔltmK) mutant
strains and subsequent metabolite analysis by HPLC showed these mutants
all abolished LTM production, confirming the involvement of this gene
cluster in LTM biosynthesis (Figure 2B). Because
the boundary of the mgs cluster in S. platensis had been previously determined by systematic gene inactivation,27 we assigned the boundary of the ltm cluster by direct comparison between the mgs and ltm clusters (Figure 2A and Figure
S2A of the Supporting Information). The ltm cluster consists of nine genes, and as would be expected
from the structural similarity between iso-MGS and LTM (Figure 1), eight of the nine genes within the ltm cluster shared significant homology with genes involved in iso-MGS
production in S. platensis NRRL 18993 (Figure 2A, Table 1, and Figure S2
of the Supporting Information).

Assignment
and Annotation of the ltm Cluster
The overall
organization of the ltm cluster is
highly conserved with respect to the mgs cluster
from S. platensis NRRL 18993 (Figure S2A of the Supporting Information), and the deduced gene
products from both clusters show remarkable sequence homologies (Table 1 and Figure S2B of the Supporting
Information). ORFs immediately upstream [orf(−15)–orf(−1)] and downstream (orf10–orf26) of the ltm cluster encode proteins
with no apparent function in 1 biosynthesis. These findings
greatly facilitated the assignment of the ltm cluster
to nine genes (LtmBCDEFGHKL) that span approximately 55 kb (Figure 2A and Table 1).

Eight
of the nine genes within the ltm cluster have homologues
in the mgs cluster (Table 1 and Figure S2A,B of the Supporting Information).27 As a result, ltmC encodes an acyl carrier protein (ACP), ltmD encodes
an amidotransferase, ltmEFG encode three AT-less
type I PKSs, ltmH encodes a discrete AT, and ltmB encodes a type II thioesterase (TE). The three LtmEFG
AT-less type I PKSs together comprise 10 PKS modules. Bioinformatics
analyses of each of the 10 modules revealed that all ketosynthase
(KS) and ACP domains are functional as they contain the conserved
Cys-His-His catalytic triad for KS domains and the Ser residue for
phosphopantetheinylation in ACP domains. However, module-8 and module-9
of LtmF are unusual, with the former lacking an ACP domain and the
latter containing two ACP domains. Other domains within the 10 PKS
modules are also predicted to be functional. Thus, the six ketoreductase
(KR) domains (in module-2, -4, -6, -7, -9, and -11) all have the conserved
GxGxxG motif for NAD(P)H binding. The five dehydratase (DH) domains
(in module-2, -6, -9, -10, and -11) all contain the conserved HxxxGxxxxP
motif. Both methyltransferase (MT) domains (in module-6 and -7) are
characterized with the ExxxGxG motif highly conserved among various S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent MTs. Module-11 of LtmG
features a TE domain at its C-terminus, which catalyzes macrolactonization
and release of the completed polyketide product. Taken together, LtmCDEFG
constitute the functional LTM AT-less type I PKS, with LtmH providing
the AT activity in trans, for the biosynthesis of the nascent glutarimide-containing
polyketide intermediate (Figure 3A,B). The
glutarimide starter unit is assembled by the loading module of LtmCD
and PKS module-2 and -3 of LtmE. LtmE module-3 features the newly
discovered branching (B) domain, a hallmark of PKS modules that generate
a β-branch by catalyzing a Michael addition of a C2 unit to
the growing polyketide chain (Figure 3C).11,14,35,36 LtmB, a type II TE, plays an editing role to ensure polyketide biosynthesis
by removing mischarged substrates or aberrant intermediates that might
otherwise block the LTM AT-less type I PKS.37,38

the AMT domain. [SAM] denotes S-adenosylmethionine
as the methyl donor for the MT domain. Green ovals represent AT-docking
domains, and the yellow domains highlight the missing domains for
the LTM AT-less type I PKS predicted according to the colinearity
model for 14 biosynthesis.

Distinct differences also exist between the mgs and ltm clusters (Table 1 and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Within the ltm cluster, pathway-specific regulatory
genes are absent, whereas the mgs cluster has a regulatory mgsA gene. While there are three genes within the mgs cluster that encode the tailoring enzymes MgsIJK, ltmK is the only gene within the ltm cluster
that encodes a tailoring enzyme, indicative of variations in post-PKS
modifications between 1 and 2 biosynthesis.
Sequence analysis revealed that LtmK is a cytochrome P450 protein
with the conserved oxygen-activating (GxxT) and heme binding (GxxxCxG)
motifs, both critical for the activity of P450 enzymes. LtmK shares
homology with MgsK (32% identical and 47% similar)17 and other cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, such as PldB
(39% identical and 54% similar) for pladienolide B biosynthesis from S. platensis Mer-1110739 and
Ema1 (34% identical and 50% similar) for avermectin biosynthesis from Streptomyces tubercidicus R-922 (Figure S1D of the Supporting Information).40 Finally, the ltm cluster contains an additional ltmL gene that is absent in the mgs cluster.
LtmL shares homology with phosphopantetheinyl transferases, including
PptA (63% identical and 72% similar) for bleomycin biosynthesis from Streptomyces verticillus,41 SePptII
(57% identical and 65% similar) for erythromycin biosynthesis from Saccharopolyspora erythraea,42 and NysF (57% identical and 65% similar) for nystatin biosynthesis
from Streptomyces noursei.43 LtmL ensures that the LTM AT-less type I PKS is in its functional
holo form by phosphopantetheinylating the serine residues of each
of the 11 ACPs.41

Development of a Genetic
System for S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53694
An efficient genetic system for S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53694 was established by E. coli–Streptomyces intergeneric conjugation (Materials and Methods). S. amphibiosporus grows well on ISP4 medium, and sporulation typically requires incubation
for 10–14 days at 28–30 °C. The S. amphibiosporus wild-type strain shows extreme sensitivity to apramycin, kanamycin,
and thiostrepton, but its growth is not affected by trimethoprim (50
μg/mL) or nalidixic acid (20 μg/mL). Although protoplast-mediated
transformation in S. amphibiosporus was not successful
under all conditions examined, E. coli–S. amphibiosporus intergeneric conjugation can proceed with
high efficiency.29 With E. coli S17-1 (DNA methylation proficient) or E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002
(DNA methylation deficient) as donors and S. amphibiosporus spores as recipients, integrative plasmids such as pSET152 can be
introduced into S. amphibiosporus with conjugation
frequencies of 10–6 or 10–7, respectively
(Table S1 of the Supporting Information). Selected E. coli–Streptomyces shuttle vectors, commonly used in Streptomyces genetics,
including pKC1218, pKC1139, pBS3031, and pHZ1358 (Table S1 of the Supporting Information), with copy numbers varying
from one to 300 copies per cell,29 were
all successfully introduced by conjugation and were stably maintained
in S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53694.

Inactivation
of ltmE and ltmH Abolishing the
Production of 1, as Well as 13–15, in SB15001 and SB15005
The identity of the cloned gene
cluster that encodes the production of 1 was confirmed
by inactivation of ltmE and ltmH in S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53694 (Materials and Methods). The ltmE gene encodes
module-2 and -3 of the LTM AT-less type I PKS that is responsible
for the biosynthesis of the glutarimide starter unit, while ltmH encodes the sole AT that loads malonyl-CoA onto each
of the PKS modules for LTM biosynthesis (Table 1 and Figure 3A,C). Both ltmE and ltmH were inactivated by replacement of an
internal fragment, encoding the KS domain in PKS module-2 of LtmE,
and a 2.3 kb fragment, encoding essentially the entire LtmH, respectively,
with the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette
through λ-RED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis.32 The genotypes of the resulting mutant strains
of SB15001 (i.e., ΔltmE) and SB15005 (i.e.,
ΔltmH) were confirmed by Southern analysis
(Figure S3A,B of the Supporting Information). Both SB15001 and SB15005 were fermented under established conditions
for LTM production18 with the S.
amphibiosporus wild-type strain as a positive control. While
the wild-type strain produced 1, with 13–15 as minor metabolites (Figure 2B, trace II),
HPLC analysis revealed that SB15001 and SB15005 completely abolished
the production of 1 and the three minor cometabolites 13–15 (Figure 2B, traces III
and IV).

Inactivation of ltmK Abolishing 1 Production and Leading to the Accumulation of 14 as
the Nascent Polyketide Intermediate
The ltmK gene encodes the sole post-PKS tailoring enzyme in 1 biosynthesis, and inactivation of ltmK would therefore
allow one to identify the nascent polyketide intermediate and explore
the exact role of LtmK in tailoring the penultimate intermediate to 1 (Figure 3B). The ltmK gene was inactivated by replacing the entire gene with the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette through λ-RED-mediated PCR
targeting mutagenesis,32 and the genotype
of the resulting SB15002 strain was confirmed by Southern analysis
(Figure S3C of the Supporting Information). To complement the ΔltmK mutation in SB15002,
pBS15007, a construct in which the expression of ltmK is under control of the constitutive ErmE* promoter,29 was introduced into SB15002 by conjugation to
afford SB15003. Finally, to investigate the effect of overexpression
of ltmK on the production of 1, pBS15007
was also introduced into the S. amphibiosporus wild-type
strain by conjugation to yield SB15004. SB15002, SB15003, and SB15004
were subjected to fermentation, under the previously established condition
for 1 production,18 with the S. amphibiosporus wild-type strain as a positive control.
HPLC analysis indicated that SB15002 completely lost its ability to
produce 1, as well as 13 and 15, but rather exclusively accumulated a compound with a retention
time identical to that of 14 (Figure 2B, trace V). This compound was isolated and characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR, confirming its identity as 14 (Figure S6 of the Supporting Information).18 Production of 1, together
with 13 and 15, as well as 14, was restored to levels comparable to that of the S. amphibiosporus wild-type strain in SB15003 (Figure 2B, trace
VI). Finally, SB15004 produced an amount of 1 similar
to that in the S. amphibiosporus wild-type strain
(Figure 2B, trace VII), indicating that the
LtmK-catalyzed tailoring step from 14 to 1 was not rate-limiting in 1 biosynthesis. Collectively,
these data unambiguously established 14 as the nascent
product for the LTM AT-less type I PKS (Figure 3). On the basis of the iso-MGS biosynthetic paradigm, we now propose
a similar model for LTM biosynthesis that features the LTM AT-less
type I PKS (Figure 3).

Expression of mgsK or mgsJK in the ΔltmK Mutant
Resulting in the Production
of Novel Analogues
We have previously established that the
three tailoring enzymes MgsIJK possessed remarkable substrate promiscuity,
accounting for the formation of the various congeners of 2 known to S. platensis NRRL 18993 (Figure S2C of
the Supporting Information).27,28 We thus reasoned that MgsK could recognize 14 as a
substrate, catalyzing regio- and stereoselective C-8 hydroxylation,
the product of which could be further methylated by MgsJ to produce
an 8-methoxy analogue (Figure 3D). Two plasmids,
pBS15010 and pBS15011, in which the expression of mgsK or mgsJK is under the control of the constitutive ErmE* promoter, were constructed and introduced into the
ΔltmK mutant SB15002 (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). The resultant recombinant
strains SB15006 and SB15007 were fermented under the same conditions
previously established for production of 1, with SB15002
as a control. Upon HPLC analysis, it was apparent that 14 was essentially all converted into a new product (16) in SB15006 (Figure 2B, trace VIII), which
was then further converted into another new product (17) in SB15007 (Figure 2B, trace IX). The two
new products were isolated from large-scale fermentations of SB15006
and SB15007, and their structures were elucidated by a combination
of spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 16 and 17, featuring the 17R-hydroxyl group as in 1 and the 8R-hydroxyl or 8R-methoxyl
groups as in 2, are novel analogues that cannot be produced
by either the LTM or iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery alone, once again
highlighting the power of combinatorial biosynthesis in natural product
structural diversity.

Structural Elucidation of 16 as 8,9-Dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM and 17 as 8,9-Dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM
Both 16 and 17 were isolated as colorless oils (Materials and
Methods). High-resolution electrospray ionization (HRESI) MS
analysis of 16 afforded an [M + Na]+ ion at m/z 498.2461, establishing its molecular
formula as C26H37NO7 (calcd [M +
Na]+ ion at m/z 498.2466).
The 1H, 1H–1H COSY, and 13C NMR spectra of 16 are very similar to those
of 15 (Figures S7 and S8 of the Supporting
Information),18 except that the
signals at δH 5.27 (dd, J = 15.5,
8.0 Hz, H-7), δH 4.45 (m, H-8), and δH 2.15 (m, H-10) in 15 are shifted to δH 5.49 (dd, J = 15.6, 3.8 Hz, H-7), δH 4.14 (m, H-8), and δH 1.79 (m, H-10) in 16, respectively, in the 1H NMR spectrum and that signals
at δC 73.4 (C-8) and δC 39.4 (C-9)
in 15 are shifted to δC 68.9 (C-8) and
δC 42.2 (C-9) in 16, respectively, in
the 13C NMR spectrum (Table S3 of the Supporting Information). The correlations of H-8 with C-6,
C-7, and C-9 and H-9 with C-8 in the HMBC spectrum of 16 established the hydroxyl group attachment at the C-8 position (Figure 4A). Thus, the only difference between 16 and 15 is the absolute configuration at C-8, and the
coupling constant values between H-7 and H-8 are diagnostic in determining
the absolute configuration at C-8. These observations agreed well
with MM2 energy-minimized configurations for the model 12-membered
macrolides with an 8S- or 8R-hydroxyl
group, where the dihedral angel (ϕ) for H-7/H-8 is 171°
(hence, a large coupling constant) or 61° (hence, a small coupling
constant), respectively (Figure 4B). Thus,
as exemplified by 15 that contains an 8S-hydroxyl group, the observed H-7/H-8 coupling constant is 8.0 Hz.18 In contrast, for 2 or 17R-hydroxy-8-desmethyl-iso-MGS (18), each of
which contains a methoxyl and hydroxyl group at C-8 with an opposite
configuration to 15 (Figure 1),
the observed H-7/H-8 coupling constant value is 3.5 or 4.0 Hz, respectively.18,28 The observed H-7/H-8 coupling constant in 16 was 3.8
Hz (Table S3 of the Supporting Information), thereby assigning the 8R absolute configuration
to 16. Thus, 16 was established as 8,9-dihydro-8R-hydroxy-LTM, and this structure is consistent with MgsK
catalyzing the same regio- and stereoselective hydroxylation as it
does for 2 and its congeners.28

of the H-7/H-8 coupling constants.

The structure of 17 was established in a manner similar
to that used for 16. Thus, HRESI-MS analysis of 17 afforded an [M + Na]+ ion at m/z 512.2617, establishing its molecular formula
as C27H39NO7 (calcd [M + Na]+ ion at m/z 512.2623). The 1H, 1H–1H COSY, and 13C NMR spectra of 17 are very similar to those of 16 (Figures S9 and S10 of the Supporting
Information), except that the signals at δH 5.49 (dd, J = 15.6, 3.8 Hz, H-7) and δH 4.14 (m, H-8) in 16 are shifted to δH 5.27 (dd, J = 15.8, 4.4 Hz, H-7) and δH 3.54 (m, H-8) in 17, respectively, in the 1H NMR spectrum and that signals at δC 138.4
(C-7), δC 68.9 (C-8), and δC 42.2
(C-9) in 16 are shifted to δC 134.5
(C-7), δC 78.4 (C-8), and δC 40.7
(C-9) in 17, respectively, in the 13C NMR
spectrum (Table S3 of the Supporting Information). Compound 17 also has extra signals attributed to
a methyl group at δH 3.29 (s) and δC 56.5. These data indicate that 17 is an O-methylated
product at the C-8 hydroxyl group of 16, and the correlations
of H-8 with C-6, C-7, and C-9 and H3C-O with C-8 in the
HMBC spectrum clearly established the methoxyl attachment at C-8 in 17 (Figure 4A). Finally, 17 was established as 8,9-dihydro-8R-methoxy-LTM,
the 8R absolute stereochemistry of which was similarly
assigned on the basis of the relatively small H-7/H-8 coupling constant
of 4.4 Hz (Table S3 of the Supporting Information).

Cytotoxicity Assay of the Two New Analogues 15 and 16 in Comparison with 1, 2, and
Selected Congeners
The SAR emerging from the preliminary
screening of a previously constructed glutarimide-containing polyketide
library has revealed that (i) 12-membered macrolides, as exemplified
by 1 and 2, have more potent cytotoxicity
against select cancer cell lines than their 14-membered and ring-open
congeners, such as 3 and 4–6, respectively,
and (ii) congeners containing a C-17 hydroxyl group are generally
more potent than their C-16/C-17 dehydrated or saturated counterparts
(Figure 1).20,22 The new analogues 16 and 17, featuring both the 17R-hydroxyl group as in 1 and the 8R-hydroxyl
or 8R-methoxyl group as in 2, a combination
of functional groups that have not been evaluated previously, presented
an opportunity to expand the SAR beyond the natural 1 and 2 congeners. Thus, 16 and 17 were assayed for cytotoxicity against three cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells, HeLa cervical carcinoma cells, and Jurkat T lymphoma
cells, and their activities were compared with the activities of 1, 2, 13, 15, and 18 (Materials and Methods).20,22 The seven compounds are all 12-membered macrolides and, with the
exception of 2, all feature the C-17 hydroxyl group yet
have varying substitutions at positions C-8 and C-9 (Figure 1).

As summarized in Table 2 (also see Figure S5
of the Supporting Information), while 1 was most potent against all cell lines, compounds 13 and 15–17, which contain 9R-hydroxyl, 8S-hydroxyl, 8R-hydroxyl,
and 8R-methoxyl groups, respectively, were more potent
than 18, which contains two hydroxyl groups at 8R and 9R, and 2 and 18 were the least potent among all the compounds tested. These
findings reinforce the significance of the C-17 hydroxyl group but
now reveal new insights into the C-8 and C-9 substitution. (i) While
a double bond at C-8 and C-9 as found in 1 is the most
potent, a single substitution at C-8 or C-9 such as in 13 and 15–17 retains significant activity, whereas
double substitutions at C-8 and C-9 such as in 2 and 18 significantly reduce activity. (ii) While there is no significant
difference between C-8 and C-9 substitution as in 16 and 13, the 8S-hydroxyl group, as in 15, appears to be more potent than the 8R-hydroxy
counterpart as in 16. (iii) O-Methylation of the 8R-hydroxyl group also increases, albeit modestly, the potency,
as in 15 and 16. These findings should facilitate
the design, engineering, and preparation of additional analogues of 1 and 2 for anticancer drug discovery and development,
and 15 and 17, which have low nanomolar
potency on par with that of 1, warrant further mechanistic
and in vivo evaluation.

Discussion
LTM
(1) is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell migration
and eukaryotic protein translation. Cloning and sequencing of the ltm biosynthetic gene cluster from S. amphibiosporus ATCC 53964 revealed that it is highly similar to the mgs gene cluster from S. platensis NRRL 18993 that
encode iso-MGS (2) biosynthesis. The ltm cluster consists of nine genes that encode an AT-less type I PKS
(LtmBCDEFGHL) for biosynthesis of the nascent glutarmide-containing
polyketide intermediate 14 and a post-PKS tailoring enzyme
(LtmK) that converts 14 to 1. Inactivation
of ltmE or ltmH completely abolished
the production of 1, while inactivation of ltmK yielded a mutant strain in which 14 accumulated. Further,
the production of 1 can be restored in the ΔltmK mutant by expressing ltmK in trans.
These results support a model for 1 biosynthesis that
features the LTM AT-less type I PKS that is very similar to the iso-MGS
AT-less type I PKS. AT-less type I PKSs harbor unusual domains and
PKS architecture and often violate the colinearity rule that is a
hallmark for type I PKSs. Comparative studies of the LTM and iso-MGS
PKSs now provide an excellent opportunity to probe how AT-less type
I PKSs select and control reductive modifications during polyketide
chain elongation.

LtmCDEFG consist of the LTM AT-less type I
PKS with LtmH acting
iteratively in trans to load malonate onto each of the 11 modules
(Figure 3A). Although the exact mechanism is
not established, the LtmD amidotransferase likely catalyzes the formation
of the signature glutarimide moiety by transferring the amine group
from glutamine to the LtmC-tethered malonate on the loading module,
in a manner akin to that of MgsD,27 SmdH,11 and ChxD.14 After
one cycle of elongation by LtmE module-2, the formation of the glutarimide
moiety invokes an unusual PKS chemistry, requiring LtmE module-3 to
catalyze a Michael addition of the C2 unit to the α,β-unsaturated
thioester (Figure 3C). While LtmE module-3
is characterized with a typical KS and an ACP domain, it features
the newly discovered B domain.11,14,35,36 Recent structural and biochemical
characterization of the KS-B didomain for rhizoxin biosynthesis from Burkholderia rhizoxinica has confirmed their role in a PKS-mediated
Michael addition, and the KS-B-ACP domain architecture has been proposed
as a hallmark to search for PKS modules that catalyze β-branching
in polyketide biosynthesis.36 Previously,
this domain has been annotated as an unknown domain in iso-MGS biosynthesis27 and as an X domain in 9-methylstreptimidone
biosynthesis.11 On the basis of the recent
structural and biochemical evidence of the KS-B domain for rhizoxin
biosynthesis, we have now adopted the B domain nomenclature for the
glutarimide-containing polyketides.14 The
revised proposal for glutarimide biosynthesis sets the stage for characterizing
the novel biochemistry in vitro (Figure 3C).

Following the assembly of the glutarimide
starter unit, eight additional
rounds of extensions catalyzed by PKS modules 4–11 produce
the full length LTM polyketide backbone, which is finally cyclized
and released as the nascent PKS product 14. Given the
structural similarity between 1 and 2 (Figure 1) and the sequence and architectural homology between
the LTM and iso-MGS AT-less type I PKSs (Figure 3, Table 1, and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information), it is therefore remarkable
that the two PKSs synthesize distinct nascent polyketides, 14 for the LTM type I PKS and 12 and 13 for
the iso-MGS type I PKS (Figure 3B and Figure
S2C of the Supporting Information). Thus,
on the basis of the collinear model for type I PKSs, the LTM PKS would
minimally lack a MT domain in module-5, a KR, a DH, and an enoylreductase
(ER) domain in module-8, and a KR and ER domain in module-10. In contrast,
the iso-MGS PKS would minimally lack a DH domain in module-4, a MT
domain in module-5, a KR domain in module-8, and a KR and ER domain
in module-10. Intriguingly, while the loading module and modules 2–7
of the LTM and iso-MGS PKSs are essentially identical, the LTM PKS
affords a single polyketide product with a hydroxyl group at C-17
and the iso-MGS PKS yields two products, the major one of which features
a double bond at C-16 and C-17. There are also distinct domain architectural
differences between module-8 and -9 for the LTM and iso-MGS PKSs;
however, how these differences account for the structural variations
in the resultant polyketide products in 1 and 2 biosynthesis remains unknown (Figure 3A,B
and Figure S2B,C of the Supporting Information). AT-less type I PKSs are rich in unusual domains and PKS architecture,
and they often violate the colinearity rule most known for type I
PKSs.44,45 Comparative studies of the LTM and iso-MGS
PKSs, as well as PKSs that direct the biosynthesis of other glutarimide-containing
polyketides,1,2,10,11,27,28 should provide opportunities to probe some of these
properties, for example, how AT-less type I PKSs select and control
reductive modifications during polyketide chain elongation.

Accumulation of 14 as the sole metabolite in SB15002
(Figure 2B, trace V) and restoration of the
production of 1 and the two minor metabolites 13 and 15 in SB15003 (Figure 2B,
trace VI) suggested that the LtmK P450 enzyme acts as a desaturase
that catalyzes regio- and stereospecific desaturation of 14 to 1, with 13 and 15 as minor
products (Figure 3B). P450 enzymes that act
as desaturases are known, but the majority are associated with liver
or lung microsomes that catalyze various metabolic biotransformation
events in eukaryotes.46−48 Only a few P450 desaturases of bacterial origin have
been described,49−52 for example, CYP102A1 of Bacillus megaterium,49−51 CYP101A1 of Pseudomonas putida,49 and CYP199A4 of Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2.52 P450-catalyzed desaturation proceeds
via abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate to yield transient
free radical intermediates, which undergo elimination of a hydrogen
radical to afford the olefin product or recombination with a hydroxyl
radical to form the hydroxylated products. Regardless of a prokaryotic
or eukaryotic origin, all known examples of P450-catalyzed desaturation
are accompanied by hydroxylation, with hydroxylation generally being
the major course of the reaction; the P450 desaturases do not convert
the hydroxylated products into olefins.53 It is therefore highly significant that, under the fermentation
conditions tested, LtmK catalyzes the desaturation of 14 to 1 with minimal formation of the hydroxylated products, 13 and 15 (Figure 3B).
Mechanistic and structural characterization of LtmK may therefore
reveal new insights into how P450 desaturases control the fate of
the initial radical intermediate in partitioning between the elimination
and hydroxylation pathways.

Compared to LtmK, the MgsK P450
enzyme in 2 biosynthesis
catalyzes the hydroxylation at position C-8, which is further O-methylated
by the MgsJ methyltransferase to furnish the methoxyl group found
at C-8 in 2. Both MgsK and MgsJ have broad substrate
promiscuity, and exploitation of the tailoring steps in 1 and 2 biosynthesis therefore provides an attractive
opportunity to engineer novel glutarimide-containing polyketide natural
products. Indeed, introduction of mgsK and mgsJK into the ΔltmK mutant strains
resulted in the production of two novel analogues 16 and 17, featuring the 17R-hydroxyl group as in 1 and 8R-hydroxyl or 8R-methoxyl
group as in 2 (Figure 1C), a combination
of structural features not seen in the natural congeners of 1 and 2. Cytotoxicity assays of 16 and 17 against select cancer cell lines, in comparison
with those of 1, 2, and specific natural
congeners, allowed us to expand the emerging SAR of the glutarimide-containing
polyketide family of natural products. Given their fascinating modes
of action as inhibitors of tumor cell migration and eukaryotic protein
translation and the potent cytotoxicity of 1 and 2 against cancer cell lines, these findings lay the foundation
for facilitating the design, development, and preparation of additional
analogues of 1 and 2 for anticancer drug
discovery and development.
