UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM)
catalyzes the interconversion
between UDP-galactopyranose and UDP-galactofuranose. Absent in humans,
galactofuranose is found in bacterial and fungal cell walls and is
a cell surface virulence factor in protozoan parasites. For these
reasons, UGMs are targets for drug discovery. Here, we report a mutagenesis
and structural study of the UGMs from Aspergillus fumigatus and Trypanosoma cruzi focused on
active site residues that are conserved in eukaryotic UGMs but are
absent or different in bacterial UGMs. Kinetic analysis of the variants
F66A, Y104A, Q107A, N207A, and Y317A (A. fumigatus numbering) show decreases in kcat/KM values of 200–1000-fold for the mutase
reaction. In contrast, none of the mutations significantly affect
the kinetics of enzyme activation by NADPH. These results indicate
that the targeted residues are important for promoting the transition
state conformation for UDP-galactofuranose formation. Crystal structures
of the A. fumigatus mutant enzymes
were determined in the presence and absence of UDP to understand the
structural consequences of the mutations. The structures suggest important
roles for Asn207 in stabilizing the closed active site, and Tyr317
in positioning of the uridine ring. Phe66 and the corresponding residue
in Mycobacterium tuberculosis UGM (His68)
play a role as the backstop, stabilizing the galactopyranose group
for nucleophilic attack. Together, these results provide insight into
the essentiality of the targeted residues for realizing maximal catalytic
activity and a proposal for how conformational changes that close
the active site are temporally related and coupled together.

The cell
walls of several fungi
and mycobacteria contain galactofuranose (Galf),
the five-membered ring of galactose.1−3 In Mycobacterium
tuberculosis Galf functions as a
linker between the peptidoglycan and the mycolic acid layer.4 In the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, Galf is an
important component in the fungal cell wall assembly, where it is
found in galactomannan, glycoproteins, sphingolipids, and lipid-linked
glycans.2 Galf is also
a major cell surface virulence factor in several human protozoan parasites.5−7 Biosynthesis of Galf is initiated by the action
of UDP-galactopyranose mutase (UGM), a flavin-dependent enzyme that
converts UDP-galactopyranose to UDP-galactofuranose (Scheme 1).8,9 The reaction catalyzed by UGM
does not involve reduction/oxidation of the sugar; however, the UGM
activity has been shown to have an absolute requirement for the reduced
flavin.10−12 The role of the reduced flavin in the isomerization
reaction has been shown to involve the formation of a flavin-galactose
adduct. Formation of the flavin-sugar adduct allows ring opening and
recyclation to form the furanose. UDP remains bound and acts as a
nucleophile producing UDP-Galf and reduced flavin.13−15 Because the reaction of UGM is essential for Galf biogenesis and the structure and mechanism of this enzyme are unique
to microorganisms, UGMs have become major targets for drug design.9,16,17

Scheme 1 Reaction Catalyzed
by UGM
Crystallographic studies established
the UGM fold, which consists
of three domains (Figure 1A). FAD binds to
the Rossmann fold substructure within domain 1. The substrate binds
primarily to domains 2 and 3 with the galactopyranose (Galp) moiety near the isoalloxazine and the uridine packed
against a helix in domain 2 known as the “uridine wall”.18 The location of the C1 atom of Galp near the N5-FAD atom is consistent with mechanistic studies showing
that the N5-FAD atom functions as a nucleophile.11,14,15,19

changes associated with the binding of UDP-Galp (or
UDP) to AfUGM. FAD and UDP-Galp are colored yellow
and green, respectively.

Conformational change linked to substrate binding is an intriguing
aspect of UGM, particularly eukaryotic UGMs (eUGMs), which have two
mobile active site flaps rather than one as in bacterial UGMs. Structural
studies of Aspergillus fumigatus UGM
(AfUGM) showed that large conformational changes accompany substrate
binding.9,18 The largest of these involve the 180s flap
(residues 179–187) and 200s flap (residues 201–209)
(Figure 1). In the resting enzyme, the flaps
are open and the isoalloxazine is solvent exposed. In complexes with
the inhibitor UDP or the UDP-Galp substrate, the
flaps are closed and the isoalloxazine and inhibitor/substrate are
buried. Closure of the active site requires movements of up to 11
Å for the 180s flap and 15 Å for the 200s flap (Figure 1B). These large conformational changes enable a
hydrogen bond between the Galp moiety of the substrate
and Arg182, a residue that is conserved in all UGMs. Also, movement
of the flaps brings together residues from disparate parts of the
sequence to form interactions that presumably stabilize the closed
state, such as the His68-Glu181 ion pair and the Arg91-Asn207 hydrogen
bond. Other residues exhibit smaller conformational changes associated
with substrate binding. Gln107 shifts 3.4 Å to engage the uracil
ring, while Tyr104 shifts 2.4 Å to make room for the uracil.
Arg91 moves 5 Å to avoid the incoming 200s flap, resulting in
a hydrogen bond with Asn207. Finally, the phenyl group of Phe66 rotates
180° to contact the Galp moiety of the substrate,
an interaction that has been suggested to help position Galp for nucleophilic attack by the flavin N5.9,18 Together, these conformational changes assemble the constellation
of residues needed to bind the transition state conformation of the
substrate, create a protected environment for catalysis, and prevent
the severed UDP from migrating out of the active site during catalysis.

Several of the critical residues involved in active site closure
are unique to eUGMs. For example, the residues of the 200s flap are
found only in eUGMs, reflecting the fact that the bacterial enzymes
have only one mobile flap corresponding to the 180s flap of AfUGM.
Also, residues near the uridine, such as Gln107, Tyr104, and Tyr317
(AfUGM numbering), are unique to eUGMs, which results in a 5 Å
shift in the position of the UMP between the bacterial and eukaryotic
enzymes. Arg91 and Phe66 are likewise unique to eUGMs, although bacterial
UGMs have a His residue that could play the role of Phe66. These differences
in amino acids, along with differences in quaternary structure, are
thought to underlie the much larger conformational changes that are
associated with substrate binding in eUGMs.

To better understand
the origins of substrate recognition and active
site dynamics, we have targeted five active site residues of AfUGM
and Trypanosoma cruzi UGM (TcUGM) that
are unique to eUGMs: Phe66, Tyr104, Gln107, Asn207, and Tyr317 (AfUGM
numbering). We show that all five residues are important for activity.
Furthermore, the crystal structures of the AfUGM variants provide
insight into the roles that these residues play in substrate recognition
and facilitating the protein conformational changes that are associated
with formation of the E-S complex.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
UDP and UDP-Galp were purchased
from Sigma. UDP-Galf was synthesized following the
chemo-enzymatic procedure developed by the Lowary group.20 Pfu Ultra Hotstart High-Fidelity DNA polymerase
was obtained from Agilent Technologies. DpnI was
from Fisher. Escherichia coli TOP-10
chemical competent cells were obtained from Invitrogen. E. coli BL21 (DE3) chemical competent cells were
from Promega (Madison, WI). The plasmid miniprep kit was from Qiagen.
Primers were from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT). All other buffers
and chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific.

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis
Primers were designed to
create the following point mutations of conserved unique active site
eUGM residues: AfUGMF66A, AfUGMY104A, AfUGMQ107A, AfUGMN207A, AfUGMY317A,
TcUGMY100A, TcUGMQ103A, TcUGMN201A, and TcUGMY317F. In prokaryotic
UGMs the residue equivalent to F66 in AfUGM is a His residue (Supporting Information Figure S1).9 In the Mycobacterium tuberculosis UGM (MtUGM) this residue corresponds to His68. In order to determine
the role of this residue the MtUGMH68A mutant was created. Site-directed
mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions
(QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit) using as template the double
mutant AfUGMK344A/K345A gene cloned into pVP55A, while the TcUGM and
MtUGM genes were cloned into pVP56K.12,15 The mutations
were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Protein Expression and
Purification
Expression and
purification of wild-type AfUGM and all mutants were done under conditions
previously reported.12,15 Similarly, TcUGM and MtUGM variants
were expressed and purified following published protocols.12,15 In general, from ∼60 g of cell paste (6 L of autoinduction
media21), ∼15 mg of purified protein
was isolated. Protein quantitation was performed by measuring the
flavin absorbance at 452 nm and using an extinction coefficient of
10.5 mM–1 cm–1 for AfUGM and 10.8
mM–1 cm–1 for TcUGM and MtUGM.12,15 No significant changes in the flavin spectra were observed in any
of the mutant enzymes. The AfUGMK344A/K345A isoform was used, as this
enzyme can form good quality diffracting crystals.

Mutase Activity
Assay
The enzymatic activity of recombinant
UGMs was tested by monitoring the formation of UDP-Galp from UDP-Galf by HPLC. The assay was performed
in 0.1 mL of 25 mM HEPES, 125 mM NaCl, 20 mM dithionite, at pH 7.5,
at various concentrations of UDP-Galf. The reaction
was initiated by addition of enzyme at 50 nM for wild-type AfUGM,
1–3 μM for AfUGM mutants, 100 nM for wild-type TcUGM,
0.5–3 μM for TcUGM mutants, 15 nM for wild-type MtUGM,
and 500 nM for the MtUGMH68A. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C
until ∼30% conversion of UDP-Galf to UDP-Galp was achieved. The reaction was terminated by heat denaturation
at 95 °C for 5 min, in a DNA engine thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules,
CA). After centrifugation, the resulting mixture was injected onto
a PA-100 (Dionex) HPLC column. The sample was eluted isocratically
with 75 mM KH2PO4, pH 4.5, at 0.80 mL/min. Absorbance
at 262 nm was monitored to identify fractions containing substrate
and product. Under these conditions, UDP-Galp eluted
at 27.35 min and UDP-Galf at 34.19 min. The extent
of conversion was determined by comparing the integration of the substrate
and product peaks. The initial velocity data was fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation to obtain the kcat and KM values.

Flavin Reduction Assay
Wild-type and mutant forms of
AfUGM were analyzed using stopped-flow kinetic experiments as previously
described.22 Briefly, the enzyme and NADPH
were mixed under anaerobic conditions at 15 °C (in 50 mM sodium
phosphate, pH 7.0), and the reaction was monitored by measuring the
decrease in flavin absorbance at 452 nm. The absorbance changes were
fit to eq 1, which describes a single exponential
process where A is the absorbance at 452 nm, kobs represents the first-order rate constant
associated with the absorbance changes, B is the
amplitude of the change, and C is the final absorbance.
Kinetic parameters for the reduction of the enzyme as a function of
NADPH were obtained by fitting the kobs values to eq 2, where kred is the rate constant for flavin reduction, and KD is the dissociation constant for NADPH. 1   2  

Crystallization
of AfUGM Variants and Crystal Soaking
To aid crystallization,
the active site mutations of AfUGM were made
on the background of the K344A/K345A double surface mutant of AfUGM.
As described previously, K344A/K345A is amenable to high resolution
X-ray crystallography, whereas crystals of the wild-type enzyme exhibit
translational pseudosymmetry and weak diffraction.18 Residues 344 and 345 are on the surface of the enzyme,
far from the active site and oligomerization interfaces; the kinetic
constants of K344A/K345A are virtually identical to those of the native
enzyme.18

Hexagonal crystals of oxidized
AfUGM mutant enzymes AfUGMF66A, AfUGMY104A, AfUGMQ107A, AfUGMN207A,
and AfUGMY317A were grown as described previously.18 Briefly, the crystals were grown in sitting drops at room
temperature with a reservoir solution containing 1.2–1.4 M
ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M sodium acetate at pH 4.5. Equal volumes
of protein solution and reservoir solution were mixed, and large yellow
hexagonal crystals were obtained. The protein stock solution consisted
of 5–9 mg/mL enzyme in a buffer of 125 mM NaCl and 25 mM HEPES
at pH 7.5. Tris(3-hydroxypropyl)phosphine was added to the protein
solution to a final concentration of 1 mM just prior to setting up
crystallization experiments. The space group is P6522 with unit cell lengths of a = 217
Å and c = 321 Å. The asymmetric unit contains
one tetramer and 75% solvent.

Crystals of reduced, ligand-free
AfUGM mutant enzymes were obtained
by exchanging the mother liquor of the respective oxidized crystal
with a reducing cryobuffer containing 1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2
M sodium acetate pH 4.5, 25% ethylene glycol or glycerol, and 80 mM
dithionite. We note that AfUGM is fully reduced in solution by 80
mM dithionite.23 The yellow color of the
crystals was bleached upon soaking, consistent with reduction. When
the color transformation was complete (2–3 min), the crystals
were plunged into liquid nitrogen to trap the reduced state.

Crystals of reduced AfUGMF66A, AfUGMN207A, and AfUGMY317A complexed
with UDP were obtained by exchanging the mother liquor with the reducing
cryobuffer supplemented with 200 mM UDP. We note that the conformational
changes attendant to UDP binding are identical to those associated
with UDP-Galp binding, thus, UDP is a good surrogate
ligand for studying substrate recognition by AfUGM.18 Furthermore, UDP is more soluble and less expensive than
UDP-Galp, so it is preferable for crystal soaking
trials that require high ligand concentrations (e.g., 200 mM) to achieve
high binding occupancy. The soaking times were 12 min for AfUGMF66A,
30 min for AfUGMN207A, and 30 min for AfUGMY317A. Analogous soaking
experiments performed with crystals of AfUGMY104A and AfUGMQ107A did
not yield convincing electron density features for bound UDP and,
thus, only the ligand-free reduced enzyme structures are reported
for these variants. A crystal of reduced AfUGMF66A was also soaked
in 100 mM UDP-Galp for 75 min.

X-ray Diffraction
Data Collection and Refinement
Diffraction
data were collected on beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source
using a Taurus-1 CMOS detector in shutterless mode and beamlines 24-ID-E
and 19-ID of the Advanced Photon Source using ADSC Quantum 315 detectors
in conventional shuttered mode. The data were integrated using XDS24 and scaled with SCALA.25,26 Amplitudes were inferred from intensities with CTRUNCATE.26 Data processing statistics are listed in Tables 3 and 4.

Crystallographic
refinement calculations for the ligand free structures were initiated
from protein coordinates derived from either the 2.25 Å resolution
structure of reduced AfUGM (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 3UTF) or the 2.25 Å
resolution structure of reduced AfUGM complexed with UDP (PDB code 3UTG). These calculations
were performed with PHENIX.27 The B-factor
model consisted of an isotropic B-factor for each atom and TLS refinement
using one TLS group per protein chain. COOT was used for model building.28 The test set of reflections used for cross validation
corresponded to the one used in previous refinements of this crystal
form of AfUGM.18,22 The structures were validated
using MolProbity29 and the PDB validation
server. Ramachandran plots were generated with RAMPAGE30 through the PDB validation server. Refinement
statistics are listed in Tables 3 and 4. Coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have
been deposited in the PDB under the accession numbers listed in Tables 3 and 4.

Results
Flavin Activation
UGMs are active only in the reduced
form.10−12,15 In eUGMs reduction
occurs by reaction with NADPH.15,22,31 In order to test if the residues targeted in this study play a role
in the activation process, the rate of flavin reduction and the binding
affinity for NADPH were determined in the stopped flow spectrophotometer
under anaerobic conditions. No significant changes were determined
in the kred values for the AfUGM variants
(Table 1), suggesting that these residues are
not involved in transition state stabilization for the hydride transfer
step. Only minor changes in the KD values
were measured, which resulted in a less than 4-fold change in the kred/KD (Table 1). These results are consistent with the reductive/activation
process being largely unaffected by the mutations.

Effect on Mutase
Activity
The equilibrium of the UGM
reaction favors the formation of the pyranose sugar 17:1.32 Thus, to allow significant product accumulation
for accurate measurement, the activity was monitored in the reverse
direction, UDP-Galp from UDP-Galf. The results are shown in Table 2. All the
mutants were active; however, major changes in the kcat values were measured (15- to 500-fold decrease). In
addition, the mutants AfUGMF66A and AfUGMQ107A displayed significant
increases in KM. AfUGMQ107A has a 20-fold
higher KM than the wild-type enzyme. AfUGMF66A
is notable in that it could not be saturated with UDP-Galf in the kinetic assays, and so only the ratio of kcat to KM could be determined.
Almost identical effects are observed in the MtUGMH68A, where saturation
could not be obtained due to an apparent high KM value (Table 2). The TcUGM variants
displayed similar catalytic deficiencies as the corresponding AfUGM
mutants, indicating a conserved role of these residues in the eUGM
family of enzymes (Table 2). Inspection of
the kcat/KM values of all the mutant enzymes studied here shows a decrease of
100–1000, suggesting that these residues play important roles
in catalysis.

Crystal Structures of Ligand-Free AfUGM Variants
The
crystal structures of reduced AfUGM variants AfUGMF66A, AfUGMY104A,
AfUGMQ107A, AfUGMN207A, and AfUGMY317A were determined to high resolution
limits of 2.05–2.30 Å (Table 3). All four structures
exhibit the three-dimensional signatures of the reduced enzyme,22 such as butterfly bending of the isoalloxazine,
donation of a hydrogen bond from the N5-FADH2 atom to the
carbonyl of Gly62, and hydrogen bonding between the imidazole of His63
and the flavin ribityl O2′. None of the mutations have a noticeable
effect on the structure of the ligand-free, reduced enzyme. For example,
the pairwise root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) between the tetramers
of the mutant and wild-type enzymes span the range 0.2–0.5
Å for Cα atoms. For reference, the RMSDs between the individual
protomers of wild-type enzyme structure are 0.2–0.3 Å.
Within 10 Å of the mutation, the RMSD for all atoms is 0.1–0.7
Å (calculated after superposition of the tetramer). Thus, the
mutations do not induce large global or local conformational changes.
These results suggest that the catalytic defects of the mutant enzymes
are not due to perturbation of the resting enzyme structure.

Crystal Structures in Complex with UDP
The structures
of reduced AfUGMF66A, AfUGM207A, and of AfUGMY317A with UDP were determined
at 2.05–2.30 Å resolution (Table 4). In crystallo flavin reduction was obtained by soaking crystals of the oxidized
enzyme simultaneously in UDP and dithionite. We note that the conformational
changes attendant to UDP binding are identical to those associated
with UDP-Galp binding; thus, UDP is a good surrogate
ligand for studying substrate recognition by AfUGM.18 Detailed analysis of each structure is provided below.

Crystal Structure of AfUGMF66A-UDP
Electron density
maps clearly indicated that UDP was bound in the active sites of two
protomers (chains A and B) of the tetramer in the asymmetric unit
(Figure 2A). Half-site binding is also observed
in structures of the wild-type enzyme complexed with UDP or UDP-Galp.18 Weak density for the ribose
and pyrophosphate is also evident in a third chain (chain C) but UDP
was not modeled in this site.

Figure 2 Structure of AfUGMF66A-UDP. (A) Electron density
and interactions
for UDP complexed to reduced AfUGMF66A. The mesh represents a simulated
annealing F0–Fc omit map (3σ). (B) Comparison of the active sites
of AfUGMF66A-UDP (gray protein, pink UDP) and AfUGM-UDP-Galp (cyan protein, green UDP-Galp). The two
protein structures are essentially identical, except for the mutated
residue.

UDP bound to AfUGMF66A adopts
the same conformation and interactions
that are observed in the wild-type complex (Figure 2). In both structures, the uracil is sandwiched between the
aromatic rings of Tyr104 and Phe158 and forms hydrogen bonds with
Gln107. The ribose group hydrogen bonds to Asn163 and Trp167, while
the pyrophosphate is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with
Arg327 and three Tyr side chains (317, 419, 453). Both active site
flaps are closed in AfUGMF66A-UDP, as in the wild-type enzyme complexes
with UDP or UDP-Galp. The Cα RMSD between AfUGMF66A-UDP
and the wild-type UDP complex is only 0.1 Å for the 180s flap
and 0.2 Å for the 200s flap, indicating nearly identical flap
conformations in the two structures. In summary, AfUGMF66A-UDP mimics
the Michaelis E-S complex except for the obvious absences of the Phe66
side chain and Galp group. The fact that AfUGMF66A
has 200-fold lower kcat/KM (Table 1) suggests that Phe66
plays an important role in catalysis that is unrelated to flap closure
and establishing the correct conformation of the UDP part of the substrate.

An additional structure was determined from a reduced AfUGMF66A
crystal soaked in 100 mM UDP-Galp (Table 4). Although electron density for the UDP moiety
is strong and indicates nearly full occupancy, density in the region
expected for Galp is diffuse and disconnected from
the UDP (Supporting Information Figure S2). Thus, it was not possible to build the Galp moiety
with confidence. It is possible that the lack of Phe66 in this mutant
induces conformational disorder in Galp, implying
that Phe66 plays a role in stabilizing Galp for nucleophilic
attack. However, we caution that conformational disorder of the Galp moiety has been observed even in wild-type UGM-UDP-Galp structures, including AfUGM (PDB codes 3UKH and 3UKF (especially chain
E)33 and Klebsiella pneumoniae UGM (PDB code 3INT, chain A).14 Nevertheless, this structure
appears to be consistent with Phe66 playing the role of the Galp backstop.

Crystal Structure of AfUGMN207A-UDP
In this complex,
the electron density maps showed that UDP is bound in the active sites
of protomers A and B (Figure 3A). Occupancy
refinement indicated occupancies of 0.85 in chain A and 0.91 in chain
B (Table 4). We focus on protomer B below.

of AfUGMN207A-UDP. (A) Electron density and interactions

annealing F0–Fc omit map (3σ). (B) Electron density for the semiclosed
200s flap of AfUGMN207A. The mesh represents a simulated annealing F0–Fc omit
map (2.5σ). (C) Comparison of the 200s flaps of flaps of ligand-free
AfUGM (magenta), AfUGMN207A-UDP (gray), and AfUGM-UDP-Galp (cyan). UDP and UDP-Galp are colored pink and green,
respectively. The dashed line indicates the Asn207-Arg91 hydrogen
bond of AfUGM-UDP-Galp.

As in AfUGMF66A-UDP, the conformation of UDP bound to AfUGMN207A
is essentially identical to that bound to wild-type AfUGM (Figure 3A). Also, all the protein–ligand interactions
in the wild-type enzyme complex are also observed in AfUGMN207A-UDP.
Thus, the AfUGMN207A-UDP structure appears to mimic the Michaelis
complex, at least in terms of the UDP portion of the substrate.

Although the UDP adopts the active conformation, the protein conformation
of AfUGMN207A-UDP is a hybrid of the open and closed states of AfUGM.
Similarly, the 180s flap adopts the closed conformation that is characteristic
of the E-S complex; however, the 200s flap (residues 201–209)
adopts a intermediate conformation (Figure 3B and C). The RMSD between AfUGMN207A-UDP and the wild-type enzyme
UDP complex is just 0.1 Å for the 180s flap but 1.9 Å for
the 200s flap. The deviation of the 200s flap from the closed conformation
is most evident near residues Pro206-Ala207 (Figure 3C). This pair of residues is poised approximately 5 Å
from the closed conformation and 10 Å from the open conformation.
Thus, the 200s flap appears to have moved about two-thirds of the
way along the pathway from open to closed.

A striking feature
of AfUGMN207A-UDP is that Arg91 and Phe66 remain
in their open conformations. These residues are close together in
the left-hand side of the active site (as pictured in Figure 1B), and electron density for these side chains is
very well-defined (Figure 3A). Previous structural
studies have shown that in the wild-type enzyme, Arg91 moves by 5
Å to form a hydrogen bond with Asn207, while Phe66 rotates by
180° to contact the Galp moiety of the substrate
(Figure 1B). Apparently, the binding of UDP
has not provoked these movements in the AfUGMN207A enzyme. These results
suggest that the final 5 Å shift of the 200s flap from the semiclosed
to closed conformation is required to induce movement of Arg91 and
Phe66.

Crystal Structure of AfUGMY317A-UDP
In the structure
of reduced AfUGMY317A, electron density for UDP is observed for all
four protomers of the tetramer (Figure 4A).
Occupancy refinement in PHENIX indicated occupancies of 0.79–0.83
(Table 4).

Figure 4 Structure of AfUGMY317A-UDP. (A) Electron
density and interactions
for UDP complexed to reduced AfUGMY317A. The mesh represents a simulated
annealing F0–Fc omit map (3σ). (B) Comparison of the conformations
of UDP (pink) bound to AfUGMY317A and UDP-Galp (green)
bound to wild-type AfUGM. Side chains of AfUGMY317A are colored gray.
Side chains of wild-type AfUGM are colored cyan. Black and yellow
dashes represent hydrogen bonds in AfUGMY317A-UDP and AfUGM-UDP-Galp, respectively.

Mutation of Tyr317 to Ala profoundly alters substrate recognition
(Figure 4). The uracil bound to AfUGMY317A
occupies the ribose site of the wild-type enzyme, forming hydrogen
bonds with Asn163. In this unexpected binding pose, the uracil is
shifted by 5–6 Å relative to the wild-type enzyme-UDP/UDP-Galp complexes (Figure 4B). The ribose
and pyrophosphate of UDP bound to AfUGMY317A occupy the space reserved
for the 180s and 200s flaps of the wild-type enzyme complex. Thus,
the bound UDP prevents flap closure. Indeed, not only are the flaps
open, but the entire protein conformation of AfUGMY317A-UDP is virtually
identical to that of the ligand-free AfUGM (RMSDs of 0.3 Å for
the tetramer and less than 0.2 Å for the flaps). If UDP-Galp binds to AfUGMY317A in this manner, the Galp moiety would be approximately 10 Å from its normal position
in the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the AfUGMY317A-UDP structure suggests
that the mutation of Tyr317 to Ala promotes a catalytically nonproductive
conformation of the substrate.

UDP Exosite
Electron
density maps also suggested the
presence of UDP bound in a pocket outside of the active site (Figure 5). The strength of the density varies among the
protomers of a given tetramer and from protein to protein. In some
cases, for example, strong density is evident only for the uridine
portion of UDP. Protomer A of AfUGMF66A provides the best example
of UDP bound in the exosite (Figure 5).

Figure 5 UDP exosite
of AfUGMF66A. (A) Ribbon drawing of AfUGMF66A-UDP showing
the location of the exosite. As in Figure 1, domains 1, 2, and 3 are colored blue, yellow, and green, respectively,
and the active site flaps are red. The inset shows a surface representation
of the exosite. (B) Electron density and interactions for UDP bound
in the exosite. The mesh represents a simulated annealing F0–Fc omit
map (3σ).

The exosite is located
at a junction between domains 1 and 3 (Figure 5A). The uracil in the exosite UDP is 18 Å from
the flavin N5 atom. The bound UDP interacts mainly with a loop that
connects domains 1 and 3 (residues 288–292). The uracil is
wedged between the side chains of Phe291 and Tyr292 and forms three
hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone. The hydroxyls of the UDP ribose
hydrogen bond to backbone carbonyls, while the pyrophosphate forms
an ion pair with Lys288. The significance of the exosite is unclear.

Discussion
Previous structural work showed that the active
site conformations
of ligand-free and substrate-bound AfUGM are very different, with
the former being highly open and the latter tightly closed.18 The structure of TcUGM-UDP shows the same closed
active site.34 Although the structure of
ligand-free TcUGM has not been determined, sequence conservation and
molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the conformational changes
described for AfUGM also occur in TcUGM.35 For discussion purposes, the transition of eUGMs from open to closed
can be deconstructed into five conformation changes: (1) closure of
the 180s flap, (2) movement of Tyr104 away from and Gln107 toward
the incoming uracil ring, (3) closure of the 200s flap, (4) movement
of Arg91 to form a hydrogen bond to Asn207, and (5) rotation of Phe66
so that it contacts Galp. The results reported here
provide insight into the essentiality of these conformational changes
for realizing maximal catalytic activity, the temporal order of conformational
changes, and how the various aspects of active site closure are coupled.

Phe66 (Phe65 in TcUGM) has been called the “Galp backstop” because it packs against the Galp moiety of the substrate, and we previously suggested that the backstop
is important for positioning Galp for nucleophilic
attack by the flavin N5.9 Here, we probed
the importance of this interaction with the AfUGMF66A mutation.

The AfUGMF66A-UDP structure is essentially identical to that of
AfUGM complexed with UDP or UDP-Galp. This result
shows that rotation of Phe66 is not required for binding the UDP portion
of the substrate in the catalytically correct conformation. However,
since the activity of AfUGMF66A is compromised, the packing of Phe66
against the Galp moiety apparently is necessary for
full catalytic efficiency. This idea is consistent with the absence
of strong electron density for Galp in the AfUGMF66A-UDP-Galp structure (Supporting Information
Figure S2). We noted previously that bacterial UGMs have a
conserved His in place of AfUGM Phe66 and suggested that the His may
also function as the Galp backstop. Using the UGM
from M. tuberculosis we tested this
hypothesis by determining the activity of MtUGMH68A (Table 1). This mutant UGM displays a similar decrease in
activity as AfUGMF66A, supporting the role of the conserved His in
bacterial UGM as the Galp backstop.

We investigated
the role of Asn207 with the AfUGMN207A and TcUGMN201A
variants. This residue is known as the “mobile Asn”
because it moves by 10 Å during the closing transition.9 In the closed state, Asn207 (Asn201 in TcUGM)
form a hydrogen bond with Arg91 (Arg87 in TcUGM), an interaction that
has been suggested to stabilize the closed active site conformation.9,18 Absence of the Asn207-Arg91 interaction in AfUGMN207A appears to
prevent the 200s flap from forming the true closed conformation when
UDP is bound, instead adopting a semiclosed conformation (Figure 3C). These results suggest that the Asn207-Arg91
hydrogen bond is essential for full closure of the 200s flap, and
complete flap closure is necessary for full catalytic efficiency.
This analysis is consistent with molecular dynamics simulations that
show the equivalent residue in TcUGM (Asn201) is involved in opening/closure
of the 200 loop via interactions with Galp.35

Another interesting characteristic of
the AfUGMN207A-UDP structure
is that Phe66 remains in the open conformation; it does not rotate
into the active site as in the structures of the wild-type enzyme
complexed with UDP or UDP-Galp. This result suggests
that rotation of Phe66 is coupled to closure of the 200s flap. Steric
repulsion is the likely coupling mechanism. Upon substrate (or UDP)
binding, Pro206 invades the space occupied by Phe66, forcing rotation
of Phe66 to avoid steric clash. In the semiclosed conformation in
AfUGMN207A-UDP, Pro206 has not moved far enough to displace Phe66
(Figure 3C).

The AfUGMY317A-UDP structure
along with the kinetics of AfUGMY317A
and TcUGMY317F suggest an essential role for Tyr317 in substrate recognition.
UDP binds to Y317A in a catalytically nonproductive conformation in
which the implied Galp moiety would be directed away
from the isoalloxazine and toward the active site entrance. A salient
feature of the structure is the 5–6 Å misplacement of
the uracil (Figure 4B). It thus appears that
Tyr317, by hydrogen bonding to the pyrophosphate, is essential for
directing the UMP into its correct binding pocket. Site directed mutagenesis
of Tyr residues in K. pneumonia UGM
showed that Tyr resides that are predicted to interact with the pyrophosphate
moiety of UDP decrease the kcat/KM value of only 10-fold, with the major effect
originating from increase in the KM value.36 The overall contribution to catalysis of active
site Tyr residues in eUGMs is much greater than in the bacterial counterparts.
We propose that this might be due to the larger flexibility of the
active site in the eUGMs.

Activation of eUGMs has been demonstrated
to occur via the stereospecific
transfer of the pro-R hydride equivalent of NADPH
to reduce the flavin. We previously showed that the binding sites
for NADPH and UDP-Galp are distinct, although both
the nicotinamide of NADPH and the Galp of UDP-Galp must be close to the isoalloxazine for activity.22 Analysis of the reaction of the AfUGM mutants
studied here with NADPH shows minimal changes in the kred of KD values. These results
further show that the active site architecture of eUGM contains unique
and separate binding interactions for UDP-Galp and
NADPH.

The structures provide a hypothesis for the order of
conformational
changes that accompany substrate binding. The fact that the active
site is completely open in AfUGMY317A-UDP is consistent with the idea
that docking of the UMP group and formation of the uracil-Gln107 hydrogen
bonds occur early in active site closure. The observation in AfUGMN207A
that the 180s flap is fully closed while the 200s flap is semiclosed
supports the idea that the 180s flap achieves the closed conformation
before the 200s flap has finished closing, although we acknowledge
that mutational analysis of 180s flap is needed to further support
this hypothesis. Finally, the fact that the open conformation of Phe66
would clash with the closed 200s loop suggests that rotation of Phe66
likely occurs in concert with closure of the 200s loop. Collectively,
the structures suggest that closure of the active site begins with
the docking of the UMP group (Figure 6A), followed
by closure of the 180s flap (Figure 6A–B)
and the concerted rotation of Phe66 and movement of the 200s flap
(Figure 6B–C). These conformational
changes likely occur in TcUGM, based on the strong sequence identity
of the active sites of eUGMs and the high structural similarity of
the AfUGM-UDP and TcUGM-UDP complexes. Since analogous TcUGM and AfUGM
mutants display similar kinetic phenotypes, the results described
here can be extended other members of the eUGM family.

possible sequence of active site conformations
that are populated during substrate binding. (A) UMP docks into the
active site and forms hydrogen bonds with Gln107. (B) The 180s flap
closes. (C) The 200s flap closes as Phe66 rotates to the “in”
conformation.

Finally, the structures
revealed a new, low affinity binding site
for UDP located 18 Å from the flavin N5 atom. Density for UDP
was observed in all the mutant enzyme structures, indicating that
binding to this site is not an artifact of any particular mutation.
The exosite of wild-type AfUGM is unoccupied at soaking concentration
of 40 mM (see PDB 3UTG) and is weakly occupied at 200 mM UDP (data not shown). Thus, the
exosite has low affinity for UDP. The apparent low affinity suggests
that the exosite is physiologically irrelevant. Also, the structures
show that binding of UDP to the exosite does not inhibit binding of
UDP to the active site. Thus, the exosite does not play a role in
catalysis or regulation. On the other hand, the exosite is reminiscent
of the sites revealed by fragment-based lead discovery. Very high
ligand concentrations are used in fragment-based methods to discover
low affinity37 compounds that serve as
starting points for designing high affinity inhibitors. Analogously,
it is temping to consider the possibility of exploiting the exosite
in the design of molecules that inhibit the activity of AfUGM.
