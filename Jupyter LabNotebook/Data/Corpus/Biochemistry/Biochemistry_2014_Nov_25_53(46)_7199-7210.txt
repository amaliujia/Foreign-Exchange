Allosteric regulation is an essential
function of many proteins
that control a variety of different processes such as catalysis, signal
transduction, and gene regulation. Structural rearrangements have
historically been considered the main means of communication between
different parts of a protein. Recent studies have highlighted the
importance, however, of changes in protein flexibility as an effective
way to mediate allosteric communication across a protein. Scapharca dimeric hemoglobin (HbI) is the simplest
possible allosteric system, with cooperative ligand binding between
two identical subunits. Thermodynamic equilibrium studies of the binding
of oxygen to HbI have shown that cooperativity is an entropically
driven effect. The change in entropy of the system observed upon ligand
binding may arise from changes in the protein, the ligand, or the
water of the system. The goal of this study is to determine the contribution
of the change in entropy of the protein backbone to HbI cooperative
binding. Molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance
relaxation techniques have revealed that the fast internal motions
of HbI contribute to the cooperative binding to carbon monoxide in
two ways: (1) by contributing favorably to the free energy of the
system and (2) by participating in the cooperative mechanism at the
HbI subunit interface. The internal dynamics of the weakly cooperative
HbI mutant, F97Y, were also investigated with the same methods. The
changes in backbone NH dynamics observed for F97Y HbI upon ligand
binding are not as large as for the wild type, in agreement with the
reduced cooperativity observed for this mutant. The results of this
study indicate that interface flexibility and backbone conformational
entropy of HbI participate in and are important for the cooperative
mechanism of carbon monoxide binding.

Allosteric
regulation is an
essential function of many proteins that control a variety of different
processes such as catalysis, signal transduction, and gene regulation.1−3 Structural rearrangements have historically been considered the
main means of communication between different parts of a protein.
Recent studies have highlighted the importance, however, of changes
in protein flexibility as an effective way to mediate allosteric communication
across a protein.4−7

The dimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis (a blood clam) (HbI) is the simplest possible allosteric system,
with cooperative ligand binding between two identical subunits. HbI
is unusual in this regard, as other known allosteric hemoglobins invariably
incorporate unlike subunits. Because of its simplicity, HbI is an
excellent system for directly exploring key issues of allostery. Equilibrium
and kinetic experiments definitively establish that both O2 and CO bind cooperatively with no modulation of ligand affinity
by non-heme ligands.8,9 Cooperativity in CO binding is
evident in the increase in combination velocity as binding proceeds.9 Analyses of kinetic and equilibrium data for
both oxygen and CO within the framework of the MWC allosteric model
for wild-type HbI and its mutants10,11 provide remarkably
good agreement for binding both ligands, strongly suggesting a very
similar cooperative mechanism is operative for CO and O2. Consistent with these results are the crystallographic findings
of very similar structures for HbI-CO and HbI-O2.12,13 The dimer is formed by apposition of helices E and F,12,13 bringing the heme groups into close proximity and permitting more
direct communication in HbI than in mammalian hemoglobins. This assembly,
which we term an “EF dimer”, has now been found in hemoglobins
from echinoderms14 and megadalton annelid
hemoglobin complexes.15

Ligand binding
in HbI is associated with localized structural transitions
(Figure 1) characterized by only a slight change
in quaternary structure (3.3° subunit rotation) but with striking
tertiary changes at the dimeric interface, including the movement
of Phe 97 from the heme pocket into the interface.13 This side chain motion disrupts a cluster of well-ordered
water molecules. As a result, the observed water molecules in the
crystal structures are more abundant and more ordered in the unliganded
interface than in the liganded form.10,13 The limited
quaternary structural transitions of HbI permit the full expression
of cooperative oxygen binding within the crystal lattice,16 a rare phenomenon not even observed with the
related tetrameric S. ineaquivalvis hemoglobin.17 This property has permitted the use of time-resolved
crystallographic analysis with nanosecond time resolution to follow
the key kinetic structural transitions, triggered by photodissociation
of CO, that underlie cooperative ligand binding.18 These crystallographic results have been supplemented with
time-resolved X-ray solution scattering results that reveal overall
kinetic pathways that follow ligand release.19 The kinetic structural transitions revealed by these studies rely
on conformational flexibility whose thermodynamic contribution to
cooperative ligand binding is the subject of this study.

and F are shown at the bottom, to highlight the conformational transition
undergone by Phe 97 (red) upon CO binding. The structural representation
was drawn using VMD.26

Thermodynamic equilibrium studies of binding of oxygen to
HbI have
shown that cooperativity in HbI is an entropically driven effect.20 In particular, the differences in free energy
(ΔΔG) and entropy [T(ΔΔS)] between the first and second
oxygen binding event are −1.3 and −5.3 kcal/mol at 298
K, respectively. Hence, in HbI, binding of the second oxygen molecule
is made thermodynamically more favorable by a less negative ΔS. This effect could result from a ligand-linked change
in the conformational entropy of HbI, that of the water surrounding
HbI, or a combination of both. The idea that cooperativity could arise
from changes in protein conformational dynamics upon ligand binding
was originally introduced in 1984 by Dryden and Cooper.21 In this entropically driven allosteric mechanism,
small changes in the protein conformational fluctuations add up to
a significant difference in free energy (ΔΔG) and become the origin of the allosteric response. The importance
of changes to protein dynamics in ligand binding processes has recently
been highlighted in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation studies.22−24

All of this evidence implies a central role of the structure
and
dynamics of HbI and of the interfacial water in allosteric communication
between the two binding sites. In this study, we investigated how
changes in HbI flexibility contribute to cooperativity using molecular
dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy.

To analyze how changes
in protein dynamics are coupled to and correlated
with structural changes upon ligand binding, we compared the internal
dynamics of wild-type (WT) HbI with those of the F97Y HbI mutant.
In this mutant protein, the side chain at position 97 is locked in
the dimeric interface, mimicking the high-affinity conformation.25 In F97Y HbI, the structural transition associated
with ligand binding, from the low-affinity state to the high-affinity
state, is completely restricted. Relative to WT HbI, F97Y HbI has
reduced cooperativity, characterized by a Hill coefficient of 1.1.
Therefore, this mutant protein allowed us to examine the role played
by changes in protein flexibility in allostery when structural changes
associated with ligand binding are severely reduced and the protein
is trapped in a high-affinity state. We found that CO binding has
a weaker effect on the backbone NH dynamics of F97Y HbI than on those
of WT HbI, implying that the internal dynamics contribute to the cooperative
binding of carbon monoxide. This work demonstrates the importance
of the modulation of flexibility in cooperative ligand binding.

Materials
and Methods
Simulation Methods
The coordinates for the set of four
HbI systems, namely, wild type bound and free and F97Y HbI bound and
free, were obtained from PDB entries 3SDH, 4SDH, 2AUO, and 2AUP, respectively. The structure files for
the homodimer systems were generated using the corresponding plugin
within VMD version 1.9.1.26 The protein
and the water molecules that were resolved in the original PDB files
were placed in a 100 Å3 simulation box, which was
then filled with additional TIP3 water molecules. The net charge of
the system was neutralized with Cl– ions.

All simulations were implemented with NAMD27 version 2.9 along with the CHARMM27 force-field parameterization.28 The long-range electrostatic interactions were
computed with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method. A smooth cutoff
for the vdW interactions was set to 12 Å with a switching distance
of 10 Å. The distances for all hydrogen bonds in the homodimers
were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm,29 while those for the water molecules were kept rigid using the SETTLE
algorithm.30

The simulation protocol
goes as follows. First, the systems were
energy-minimized using a conjugate gradient method coupled to a line-search
algorithm for 50000 steps, which was more than sufficient to reach
convergence. The energy minimization was followed by a series of thermalization,
equilibration, and production runs under periodic boundary conditions
performed in the NPT ensemble. The thermalization
schedule was conducted using a time step of 0.5 fs under constant-pressure
(1 atm) conditions using a Langevin barostat by bringing the system
from a temperature of 10 K to the target temperature of 298 K in 10
K increments via temperature reassignments every 1.0 ps. Once the
target temperature was reached, the simulation proceeded for a total
of 300 ps. The systems were further equilibrated at a constant temperature
(298 K) and pressure (1 atm) for a total of 500 ps with 1 fs time
steps under the action of Langevin temperature control. The Langevin
pressure control values for the oscillation period and damping coefficient
were set to 200 and 100 fs, respectively, and the damping coefficient
in the Langevin thermostat was set to 0.1 ps–1.
The time step was then increased to 2 fs, and the systems were allowed
to equilibrate for 1 ns in the final preparation for production runs.
For each system, three 20 ns production runs and one 200 ns production
run were collected. The results from the 200 ns runs did not differ
significantly from those from the 20 ns runs; as a consequence, the
200 ns production runs were divided into 20 ns blocks and combined
with the 20 ns production runs for data analysis.

Additional
simulations of CO-bound and free WT HbI were performed
in the NVE ensemble. The systems were first minimized
using a conjugate gradient algorithm and then equilibrated in the
isothermal–isobaric ensemble using Langevin dynamics and the
Nosé–Hoover Langevin piston method. Subsequently, equilibration
was performed in the NVE ensemble with velocity reassignment
to generate three trajectories with independent velocities and to
ensure the stability of the temperature. The systems were then simulated
in the NVE ensemble for 8 ns. The first 2 ns were
sufficient for the final equilibration, as judged by the backbone
and all-atom rmsd. An additional 6 ns were collected and used to confirm
the results of the longer NPT ensemble simulations.
The Lipari–Szabo order parameters of the simulations in the NVE and NPT ensembles agree within the
error. In addition, the transitional behavior of the Phe 97 χ1 dihedral angle was observed in these shorter trajectories,
as well.

To characterize the structural and dynamical changes
between the
free and bound state of HbI, we calculated the radius of gyration,
the secondary structure, the rms fluctuations, the dihedral angle
χ1 defined by the C, Cα, Cβ, and Cγ atoms of residue Phe 97 in the WT and Tyr
97 in F97Y mutant HbI, and Lipari–Szabo order parameters31,32 using VMD26 along with bespoke programs
previously described elsewhere.33

Protein
Expression and Purification
HbI was expressed
in Escherichia coli Q-cells34 under the control of a T7 promoter, in M9 minimal medium supplemented
with a standard vitamin mix and a solution with traces of metals.35 To label HbI, the glucose and ammonium chloride
of M9 was substituted with 13C- and 15N-labeled
compounds, respectively. HbI was induced for 6 h with 1 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and supplemented
with 84 μM aminolevulinic acid (ALA).

HbI and F97Y HbI
were purified as previously described.35 Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 M Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl,
10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), and 5% (w/v) glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication,
duty cycle 7, for 30 s every minute for 5 min. The lysed cell solution
was treated with DNase1, RNaseA, and 6 mM MgCl2 for 30
min. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15000 rpm.
Contaminates salt out of solution at 45% saturation with ammonium
sulfate; HbI salts out at 95% saturation with ammonium sulfate. HbI
was isolated using a DEAE column in 40 mM 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic
acid (CHES) (pH 9.0) and a CM Sepharose column in 40 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) (pH 7.0).

Sample Preparation
CO-liganded samples
were prepared
by flushing the tubes with CO before adding CO-saturated hemoglobin
and sealing. Unliganded HbI samples were prepared from CO-HbI; to
remove CO, samples were first agitated and flashed with white light
in the presence of oxygen. Then to produce unliganded samples, O2-HbI was exposed to flashes with white light in a N2 environment overnight. A trace amount of sodium dithionite was added
to deoxy-HbI samples before being sealed with epoxy within the anaerobic
chamber. Absorbance at 534, 416, or 422 nm light indicates the presence
of deoxy-HbI, O2-HbI, or CO-HbI, respectively. Similar
procedures have been successfully used on other hemoglobins for many
years.36−38

NMR Spectroscopy
The backbone resonance
assignments
of HbI in the liganded and unliganded states were obtained39 and are available from the BioMagResBank as
entries 25285 and 25286, respectively. Three-dimensional (3D) sensitivity-enhanced
gradient-selected 1H–15N TROSY (transverse
relaxation-optimized spectroscopy) triple-resonance experiments [HNCA,
HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO]40,41 were conducted at 14.1 T and 298 K using uniformly 2H-, 13C-, and 15N-labeled 0.6 mM F97Y HbI [50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 95% H2O/5% D2O].
Additional 3D 15N-edited 1H–1H NOESY and HMQC-NOESY-HSQC experiments were conducted at 14.1 T
and 298 K and used to aid in the backbone resonance assignment of
F97Y HbI in both the free and bound states. All NMR 15N
relaxation experiments were performed at 298 K on uniformly 15N-labeled samples of HbI and F97Y HbI [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 150
mM NaCl, and 95% H2O/5% D2O] at the following
concentrations: 0.8 mM CO-HbI, 0.8 mM unliganded HbI, 0.7 mM CO-F97Y,
and 1.0 mM unliganded F97Y. All NMR triple-resonance and 15N spin relaxation data were collected on a Varian Inova spectrometer
operating at 600 MHz equipped with a triple-resonance cold probe.
The temperature was calibrated using a sample of 100% methanol. 15N R1 and R2 values and {1H}–15N NOEs were
measured using standard methods.42 Nine
relaxation delays, two of which were duplicates, were used to measure R1 and R2. Relaxation
delays ranged between 0 and 0.666 s for R1 and between 0 and 0.090 s for R2. The
interval between 180° pulses in the CMPG experiment used to measure R2 was 1.5 ms. Three sets of NOE data (proton-saturated
and nonsaturated spectra) were collected in an interleaved manner.
Data were acquired with 128 (t1) ×
2048 (t2) complex points and spectral
widths of 2200 × 8000 Hz. Data processing was performed using
NMRPipe,43 Sparky,44 and Curvefit (www.palmer.hs.columbia.edu), along with
programs written in house. Intensities of cross-peaks were used to
quantify relaxation, and uncertainties were estimated from duplicate
(R1 and R2) or triplicate (NOE) experiments.

Model-Free Analysis
The dominant source of an amide 15N spin relaxation is
the dipolar interaction with the attached
proton spin and the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) mechanism. The
experimentally measured relaxation rates R1 and R2 and the NOE are dependent on
linear combinations of the spectral density function at specific frequencies45 1   2   3  where c = ωNΔσ/√3, d = (μ0hγHγN/8π2)⟨rNH⟩–3, μ0 is the permeability of free space, h is Planck’s constant, γH and γN are the gyromagnetic ratios of the H and N nuclei, respectively, rHN is 1.04 Å, and Δσ = −162
ppm is the 15N CSA.

Relaxation rates were analyzed
using the Lipari–Szabo model-free formalism.31,32 The Lipari–Szabo model-free formalism assumes that the internal
motion of the N–H vector is uncorrelated with the overall rotational
motion of the protein and is characterized by two parameters: a generalized
order parameter, S2, which defines the
amplitude of the motion, and an effective internal correlation time,
τe, which measures the time scale. In the Lipari–Szabo
formalism extended by Clore et al.,46 the
spectral density function can be described as 4  where S2 = Sf2Ss2, 1/τf′ = 1/τf + 1/τm, and 1/τs′ = 1/τs + 1/τm. S2 is the generalized
order parameter, and Sf2 and Ss2 are the generalized order parameters
of the fast and
slow components, respectively, of internal motion. The order parameter
is a measure of the degree of freedom of the motion of the intermolecular
amide bond vector; S2 is equal to 1 if
the motion is completely restricted and is equal to 0 for isotropic
motion. τm is the isotropic rotational correlation
time, and τf and τs are the effective
correlation times of the fast and slow internal motions, respectively.
Both τf and τs are much faster than
τm.

Values of the R2/R1 ratio were used to estimate the rotational
diffusion
tensor using the program r2r1_diffusion (www.palmer.hs.columbia.edu). Residues that have a value of the R2 rate constant more than one standard deviation from the mean and/or
have NOE values of &lt;0.65 were excluded from this analysis.47

The relaxation data were analyzed using
the program FAST Modelfree48 (http://xbeams.chem.yale.edu/∼loria) and Modelfree 4.20 (www.palmer.hs.columbia.edu). Five
different motional models were used to facilitate the analysis of
the relaxation data.49 For models 1–4, S2 = Sf2. Model 1 optimizes Sf2 assuming
that internal motions are very fast (τf ≈
0) and slow internal motions are negligible (Ss2 = 1, and τs = 0). Model 2 optimizes Sf2 and τf = τe assuming slow internal motions are negligible (Ss2 = 1, and τs = 0). Models
3 and 4 are the same as models 1 and 2, respectively, but include
the chemical exchange term Rex. Model
5 optimizes Sf2, Ss2, and τs = τe and assumes that internal motions on the fast time scale are very
fast (τf ≈ 0).

Order parameters have
been used to estimate an upper bound for
the change in entropy, ΔS,
resulting from conformational restriction:50 5  where N is the total number
of affected nuclei, Sa,i and Sb,i are the order
parameters of the ith spin in states a and b, respectively,
and kb is Boltzmann’s constant.
This equation accounts for only the entropic effect of the part of
the conformational ensemble characterized by the set of S2 values and neglects any correlation between spins.

Results
Characterization of the Structure and Dynamics of HbI in Solution
Using MD Simulations
HbI Structure in Solution
Analysis
of the solution
structures of WT HbI and the F97Y mutant from the MD trajectories
in the free and CO-bound states shows only minor differences from
the X-ray structures of these proteins. HbI is a symmetric dimer in
solution; the small difference observed between the X-ray structures
of the two subunits is lost, and the system relaxes to a symmetric
structure during the equilibration period of the trajectories (Table 1). Our results are in agreement with those of a
previous Raman spectral study of unliganded HbI, where the observation
of only a single set of lines had indicated that the protein is symmetric
in solution.51 These results indicate that
the small asymmetry observed between the two subunits in the liganded
and unliganded HbI crystal structures results from lattice interactions
and is not fundamental to the function of HbI.

One of the main differences
observed in the X-ray structures of
the free and bound states of HbI is the movement of the side chain
of Phe 97 from the heme pocket into the interface,13 as indicated by the change in the χ1 angle
[from ≈60° to ≈160° upon binding CO (Figure 1)]. These conformations of the side chain of Phe
97 are termed as T- and R-state conformations, characterized by χ1 values of ≈60° and ≈160°, respectively.
Analysis of the MD trajectories showed that while the side chain of
Phe 97 always maintains the R-state conformation when bound to CO,
the side chain of Phe 97 fluctuates between the T- and R-state conformations
in the absence of CO, as shown in Figure 2a.
This result is remarkably different from the X-ray structures and
from what was observed in a previous MD study of HbI.13,52 The observed discrepancy can be explained considering that in this
study WT HbI and the F97Y mutant were simulated for a much longer
time. The MD trajectories previously collected by Zhou and co-workers
of WT HbI in the free and bound states are 1 ns long. We collected
longer trajectories, three 20 ns long and one 200 ns long trajectories
for each protein in each state. Each protein was equilibrated for
a period of 6 ns. The transition of the side chain of Phe 97 from
the T to R state occurs in the absence of CO during the equilibration
period, after which the side chain fluctuates between the two states.

residue 97. Shown are the distributions of the populations of dihedral
angle χ1, defined by the C, Cα,

calculated from the MD simulations of WT HbI (a) and F97Y HbI (b).
The histograms calculated from the MD trajectories of the unliganded
and liganded proteins are colored white and black, respectively.

For the entire lengths of the
simulations of F97Y mutant HbI, the
side chain for Tyr 97 is always in the bound-state conformation in
the presence and absence of CO, as observed in the X-ray structures
(Figure 2b).

Dynamics of HbI in Solution
The dynamics of HbI in
solution were analyzed to fully understand the dynamic changes undergone
by this protein upon ligand binding and particularly to investigate
the important role of the interfacial residues. In addition, to test
the hypothesis that the internal dynamics of HbI is coupled to its
allosteric regulation, the fast internal motions of the weakly cooperative
R-state mimetic, F97Y HbI, were simulated and compared with the dynamics
of WT HbI.

To characterize the internal dynamics, the Lipari–Szabo
order parameters, S2, were calculated
from the MD simulation of WT HbI and the F97Y mutant in the liganded
and unliganded states (Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information). To be able to validate our findings against experimental
data, we focused our analysis on the dynamics of the backbone amide
groups. The computed S2 values are in
good agreement with the experimentally determined values (described
below), as shown in Figure 3, with the exception
of helix C and the CD loop (highlighted with a red box in Figure 3), where the large errors in the order parameters
indicate that the MD simulations have not converged in these regions
of the protein. For this reason, residues from helix C and the CD
loop were excluded from the following analysis. The order parameter
difference between the free and bound states represents the change
in backbone NH dynamics that occurs upon ligand binding. The calculated
difference of the order parameters between the free and bound states
shows that there are small differences in the internal dynamics of
the protein in these two states (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information and Figure 4). In the WT protein, the largest differences are observed in the
pre-A, B, F, and G helices (Figure 4), while
the F97Y internal dynamics are most affected by binding in helices
E and F. From Figure 4, one can make the qualitative
observation that the residues surrounding the heme group become more
flexible upon ligand binding. This tendency is more evident in the
WT where, for example, the backbone amide groups of helices E and
F that become more flexible upon CO binding are located on the heme-facing
side of the helix. The backbone amide groups of both WT and F97Y HbI
become globally more flexible upon binding CO, but this effect is
more pronounced in the WT protein than in the F97Y mutant (Table 2). Comparison of the difference of the backbone
NH S2 values with the computed rms fluctuations
of each helix (Figure 5) shows a good correlation
of the data: a decreased average order parameter of a helix associated
with binding corresponds to an increased rms fluctuation from the
average structure of the helix, and vice versa. Helix G of WT HbI
shows the largest rms fluctuation difference between the free and
bound states. This is a result of the fraying of the N-terminus of
helix G that is observed with a much higher probability in the CO-bound
state (Figure 6). In addition, the C-terminus
of helix F is less stable in the CO-bound state of WT HbI than in
the unliganded state.

Figure 3 Comparison of the experimentally determined order parameters, S2, with those calculated from the MD simulations.
The S2 values are shown as a function
of the protein sequence for WT CO-bound HbI (a), unliganded WT HbI
(c), CO-bound F97Y HbI (e), and unliganded F97Y HbI (g). Experimentally
determined S2 values are shown as empty
circles, and S2 values calculated from
the MD simulations are shown as filled circles. The difference between
the simulated and experimental S2 (ΔS2 = SMD2 – Sexp2) is shown
as a function of residue number for WT CO-bound HbI (b), unliganded
WT HbI (d), CO-bound F97Y HbI (f), and unliganded F97Y HbI (h). Secondary
structural elements are shown at the top of each plot. Solid bars
represent α-helices, and lines represent loops. Helix C and
the CD loop are highlighted with a red box.

calculated from the MD simulations. The top panel shows ΔS2 = SCO2 – Sfree2 calculated
for each residue of WT and F97Y HbI mapped onto the respective structure.
The structure of WT HbI is shown on the left and that of F97Y HbI
on the right. The color scale goes from red (ΔS2 = −0.005) to white (ΔS2 = 0) to blue (ΔS2 = 0.005). Residues characterized
by a ΔS2 value of ≤−0.005
are colored red, and residues characterized by a ΔS2 value of ≥0.005 are colored blue. Proline residues
and residues located on helix C and on the CD loop are colored gray.
The structural representation was drawn using PyMOL.57 The bottom panel shows the difference in the order parameter
between the liganded and unliganded states, averaged for each secondary
structural element (ΔS2 = ⟨SCO2 – Sfree2⟩) between CO-bound and free WT HbI
(black) and F97Y HbI (red).

of HbI from the MD simulations. The rms fluctuations of each α-helix
of the protein are colored black for WT HbI and red for F97Y-HbI;
opaque and transparent bars are used for the liganded and unliganded
states, respectively. The backbone N, C, and O atoms were used to
calculate the rms fluctuations. The error bars were calculated from
the standard deviation among the trajectories.

results calculated from the MD simulation of WT HbI and the bottom

the top of each plot. Solid bars represent α-helices, and lines
represent loops.

Thermodynamic equilibrium studies
of binding of oxygen to HbI have
shown that binding of the second oxygen molecule is made more favorable
by a less negative entropic term, ΔS.20 The computed S2 values
for the backbone amide groups were used to estimate the change in
backbone conformational entropy associated with binding.50 The protein conformational entropic contribution
to the binding free energy of carbon monoxide (TΔS) was estimated to be 1.8 ± 0.6 kcal/mol for WT and
1.3 ± 0.6 kcal/mol for F97Y. The results of the MD simulations
show that as in the WT protein, F97Y HbI also becomes more flexible
upon binding CO but to a smaller degree than the WT protein. The reduced
effect that CO binding has on the internal dynamics of the protein
can explain the reduced cooperativity observed in this mutant protein
relative to that of WT HbI. Figure 7 shows
the contribution made by each helix to the conformational entropy.
Helices pre-A, F, and G make the largest contribution to the conformational
entropy. In the WT protein, the contribution from helix pre-A and
helix G is larger than in the mutant protein. The backbone amide dynamics
in the interfacial helices E and F are affected differently by binding
the ligand and consequently have opposite effects on the entropic
change associated with binding. Helix C and the CD loop were excluded
from this analysis because these regions of the protein need longer
trajectories to converge (Figure 3).

NMR Studies of HbI and F97Y HbI
HbI Is a Symmetric Dimer
in Solution
In agreement with
what was observed in the MD simulations, HbI is a symmetric dimer
in solution in both the liganded and unliganded states, as confirmed
by the observation of only one set of signals corresponding to a monomeric
subunit in two-dimensional (2D) 1H–15N correlation spectra (Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information).

Because of autoxidation of the heme iron
in oxygenated hemoglobins, carbon monoxide (CO) is often used as an
O2 mimic in studies that require long incubation with a
ligand, as in the studies reported here. There is strong evidence
that this is appropriate for HbI. As described above, crystallographic,
kinetic, and equilibrium studies combined with allosteric analysis
strongly imply a fundamental thermodynamic similarity in the cooperative
binding of both ligands to HbI.9,11−13

Figure S2 of the Supporting Information shows the different spectra acquired for CO-bound and unbound HbI.
The chemical shift differences between these two spectra are due to
the presence of the paramagnetic Fe2+ in the unliganded
state but also reflect the structural changes undergone by the protein
upon CO binding. Even the subtle ligand-linked structural changes
in HbI detected by X-ray crystallography (between 0.5 and 1 Å)
result in significant differences in chemical shift values. In HbI,
the structural change, although relatively localized, affects the
chemical environment of the entire dimeric interface because ligand
binding is coupled with a change in quaternary structure (3.3°
subunit rotation)13 in addition to striking
tertiary changes at the core of the interface.

Resonance
Assignments
The backbone assignments of unliganded
and CO-liganded HbI were determined (BioMagResBank entries 25286 and
25285, respectively).39 The backbone assignment
of unliganded F97Y HbI was determined using three-dimensional triple-resonance 1H–15N TROSY experiments, including HNCO,
HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH40 collected at 14.1 T and at 298 K using uniformly 2H-, 13C-, and 15N-labeled samples. Assignments
of the CO-bound F97Y mutant HbI were obtained by comparison with the
spectrum of CO-bound WT HbI supplemented by the use of 1H–1H NOESY and HMQC-NOESY-HSQC experiments.40 Each subunit of HbI consists of 146 residues.
In addition to the three proline residues that do not give rise to
a signal in a 2D 1H–15N correlation spectrum,
the residues that could not be assigned due to overlap or the lack
of a signal are listed in row a of Table S1 of the Supporting Information.

Effect of the Paramagnetic
Fe2+ in the Unliganded
State on the Relaxation Rates
The presence of a paramagnetic
center in the unliganded state of HbI dramatically affects the relaxation
properties of the nearby nuclei. Because of the increased transverse
relaxation rates, the signal of many of the residues on helix E and
helix F is too weak to be detected in the unliganded state. The paramagnetic
contribution, caused by interaction with the metal ion, to the transverse
and longitudinal relaxation rates is a function of the distance from
the Fe2+ ion with 1/r6 dependence.
As a consequence, the paramagnetic effect is the dominant contribution
to R1, R2,
and NOE for nuclei proximal to the Fe center but will be negligible
for nuclei that are &gt;11.5 Å from the paramagnetic center as
shown
in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. Residues with a non-negligible paramagnetic contribution to the
relaxation rates can be easily identified from a plot of the relaxation
times as a function of 1/rN–Fe6, where rN–Fe is the distance
between the amide N and the Fe2+ ion.53 The residues with a detectable signal that were used in
the model-free analysis were found not to be susceptible to the paramagnetic
interaction with the Fe2+ ion, as shown by the independence
of their transverse, T2, and longitudinal, T1, relaxation times from rN–Fe (Figure S3 of the Supporting
Information).

Internal Dynamics of HbI
NMR 15N longitudinal, R1, and transverse, R2, relaxation rate constants and {1H}–15N nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE)11 were measured for all the spectrally resolved
amide backbone groups
in WT and F97Y HbI in both the liganded and unliganded states at 14.1
T and 298 K (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information). Residues for which relaxation parameters could not be accurately
determined, because of severe spectral overlap or low signal intensities,
were excluded from the model-free analysis and are listed in rows
b and c, respectively, of Table S1 of the Supporting
Information.

Laboratory-frame relaxation data were analyzed
using the Lipari–Szabo model-free formalism.32 Knowledge of the rotational diffusion properties of HbI
is necessary for model-free analysis. Analysis of the R1/R2 ratio was used to estimate
the overall rotational correlation time47 and determine the axially symmetric diffusion model to be the best
representation for the rotational diffusion of WT HbI and F97Y HbI
in both the liganded and unliganded states. The F test was used to determine that the axially symmetric diffusion
tensor was an improvement over the isotropic diffusion model for both
WT and F97Y HbI in both the bound and free states. The resulting axially
symmetric diffusion tensor is described by Diso = (9.41 ± 0.01) × 106 s–1 and D∥/D⊥ = 1.05 ± 0.01 for WT HbI in the liganded state
and Diso = (9.88 ± 0.01) × 106 s–1 and D∥/D⊥ = 1.11 ± 0.01 for WT
HbI in the unliganded state. The axially symmetric diffusion tensor
that was found to describe the F97Y HbI mutant was characterized by Diso = (1.03 ± 0.01) × 107 s–1 and D∥/D⊥ = 1.07 ± 0.01 in the liganded
state and Diso = (9.86 ± 0.02) ×
106 s–1 and D∥/D⊥ = 1.17 ± 0.02 in the
unliganded state. The values of Diso and D∥/D⊥ obtained from the analysis of R1/R2 were used as initial input in the first round
of model selection in the model-free analysis.

The order parameters, S2, describing
the amplitude of the backbone motion on the picosecond to nanosecond
time scale, were calculated for WT HbI and F97Y HbI in the free and
CO-bound states (Figure 8 and Figure S5 of
the Supporting Information). These experimentally
determined S2 values were used for the
validation of the computational model, through direct comparison of
the simulated and experimental S2 values
(Figure 3). The NMR study of the internal dynamics
of WT HbI and F97Y HbI confirms that the dynamics are affected by
CO binding (Figure 8). A residue-by-residue
comparison between the free and bound states is difficult because S2 values are not available for the same residues
in both states. For this reason, the S2 values were averaged for each secondary structural element to draw
some general conclusions about the effect of ligand binding on the
dynamics of these proteins (Table 3), although
caution should be used particularly when the number of observations
is quite low and uneven.

and F97Y HbI. Order parameters, S2, are

HbI are shown as filled circles, and S2 values for unliganded HbI are shown as empty circles. Secondary
structural elements are shown at the top of each plot. Solid bars

a The number of residues whose

When
averaged S2 values are compared,
F97Y HbI is generally more rigid than WT HbI, in the free and bound
state. When the backbone NH order parameters calculated in the liganded
and unliganded states of each protein are compared, the most obvious
difference between the internal dynamics is observed at helix B, which
upon CO binding becomes more rigid in F97Y HbI than in WT HbI, where
the observed changes are more heterogeneous. The opposite is true
in helix G, which is more flexible in the bound state than in the
unliganded state for both proteins, but more so in WT HbI than in
F97Y HbI.

Most residues of HbI in the free state fit to simpler
models than
in the CO-bound state, indicating a reduced flexibility of the protein
in the unbound state. Figure 9 shows the residues
that required a chemical exchange contribution, Rex, to the relaxation model in the fitting. In the CO-bound
state, 10 residues, mostly located on interfacial helices E and F,
were fit to a motional model that used an Rex term, while only two residues required a non-zero chemical exchange
contribution to relaxation. The presence of a chemical exchange contribution, Rex, to R2 for residues
located on interfacial helices E and F indicates the presence of conformational
fluctuations occurring on the microsecond to millisecond time scale.
These fluctuations might be important in the ligand release mechanism.

and empty bars for CO-bound HbI and unliganded HbI, respectively (c).
Secondary structural elements are shown at the top of the plot. Solid
bars represent α-helices, and lines represent loops.

Fewer residues in F97Y HbI required the inclusion
of a chemical
exchange contribution to the transverse relaxation rate constant compared
to the number in the wild type, only four in the liganded state and
one in the free state, as shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information, confirming that this protein has reduced
flexibility relative to that of the wild type.

From the backbone
NH order parameters, the protein conformational
entropic contribution to the binding free energy of carbon monoxide
(TΔS) was estimated to be
1 kcal/mol. Because of the increased transverse relaxation rates,
the signal of many of the residues on interfacial helices E and F
is too weak to be detected in the unliganded state. Thus, because
of the presence of a paramagnetic center in the unliganded state of
HbI, we cannot collect NMR data for many of the residues of helices
E and F. The conformational entropy change that we estimated from
the order parameters accounts only for the changes in conformational
fluctuations of the residues with an experimentally derived order
parameter; furthermore, it neglects any correlation between spins.
When estimating the change in conformational entropy from the experimentally
derived order parameters, we are using a small subset of residues
for which we have data from both the bound and free states, 61 residues
for the WT and 42 for the F97Y mutant. This number of residues is
smaller than the total number of available experimentally derived
order parameters for the bound and free states. In addition, using
molecular dynamics simulations described above, we estimated that
the largest contribution to the conformational entropy of binding
comes from the backbone NH groups for which we do not have experimental
data. For these reasons, the value of TΔS estimated from the NMR order parameters needs to be taken
with caution but may represent a lower limit; nevertheless, it supports
the hypothesis that the increased protein backbone flexibility associated
with ligand binding contributes to cooperativity in HbI.

On
average, F97Y HbI is more rigid in the CO-bound state than in
the free state. The estimated contribution to the free energy of binding
arising from the conformational restriction associated with CO binding
is −4 kcal/mol. Unfortunately, accurate thermodynamic parameters
for the two steps of ligand binding to F97Y are not available. Again,
this result is likely to be inaccurate as it suffers from the same
limitations mentioned above, particularly because even more than for
WT HbI, we were not able to calculate the order parameters, S2, of many residues in the unliganded state.

The differences between the values of TΔS obtained from the experimentally determined S2 values and those obtained from the MD simulations result
from the lack of experimental relaxation data for many backbone NH
groups in the unliganded state for the wild type and particularly
for the F97Y mutant protein, and from the exclusion of the residues
of helix C and the CD loop in the evaluation of TΔS from the MD simulation (see above). Nevertheless,
the overall trend from both computational analysis and NMR experiments
is similar, thus supporting a contribution of conformational entropy
to HbI cooperativity.

Discussion
Structural
studies of HbI have been powerful in demonstrating the
important role of local structural rearrangements in cooperative ligand
binding. In this study, using computer simulation and NMR relaxation
methods, we tested the hypothesis that the dynamics of HbI are also
involved in HbI cooperativity. We demonstrate that the backbone flexibility
of HbI contributes to cooperativity in two ways: (1) by contributing
favorably to the free energy of binding and (2) by participating in
the cooperative mechanism at the HbI subunit interface.

To determine
if the changes in backbone NH dynamics observed for
HbI upon ligand binding were connected to its allosteric behavior,
we compared the results obtained for WT HbI with those of the high-affinity-state
mimic mutant protein F97Y HbI. This mutant protein of HbI explores
the mutation of the phenylalanine on helix F whose side chain conformational
transition, from the heme pocket to the dimeric interface, plays a
central role in the allosteric mechanism of HbI and is characterized
by a greatly reduced cooperativity. If the increased flexibility observed
upon binding drives cooperativity, we expected this mutant to show
a different change in dynamics upon ligand binding. Indeed, we found
that the change in backbone NH flexibility of F97Y HbI associated
with CO binding is diminished throughout this mutant protein relative
to the wild-type protein. The change in conformational entropy associated
with ligand binding is not as favorable in F97Y HbI as it is in WT
HbI. These results demonstrate that changes in conformational entropy
contribute together with structural changes to the cooperative mechanism
of HbI.

X-ray crystallography has shown that HbI undergoes a
quaternary
structural rearrangement upon ligand binding; the HbI subunits rotate
by 3.3°.13 In addition, helix F of
HbI undergoes the largest conformational change upon ligand binding.
This conformational rearrangement by helix F, including Phe 97, is
critical, as is evident by the loss of cooperativity in the F97Y mutant
of HbI. F97Y HbI undergoes a similar change in quaternary structure
characterized by a 3.0° subunit rotation.25 However, for both the unliganded and CO-bound states of
F97Y HbI, the tyrosine side chain at position 97 remains in the hydrophilic
interface; this prevents helix F from undergoing a conformational
transition that brings its backbone closer to the heme.13

In this study, we coupled molecular dynamics
simulations with NMR
relaxation measurements to investigate the role played by protein
dynamics in cooperativity. Because of the presence of a paramagnetic
center in the unliganded state of HbI, we were not able to collect
NMR data for many of the residues of interfacial helices E and F.
This dramatically impacted our ability to experimentally estimate
the effect of ligand binding on the internal dynamics of the protein,
and its role in cooperativity. Integration of the NMR data with the
results of the MD simulations of HbI and F97Y HbI in the unliganded
state has been essential to fully understand the dynamic changes of
the interfacial residues. MD simulations are not subject to the experimental
limitations of the NMR studies and allow us to collect data on all
the residues of the protein, including the interfacial residues that
may be particularly important to allostery. One important focus of
this study was the validation of the computational model through direct
comparison of the simulation results with experimental observations
of the structure and dynamics of HbI obtained using NMR spectroscopy.
The good agreement observed between the experimentally determined
order parameters and those calculated from the MD simulations (Figure 3) ensures that MD simulations of HbI and F97Y HbI
are able to capture the dynamics of these proteins and their changes
between the free and bound states. Our studies have shown that ligand
binding promotes a change in the backbone NH dynamics of helix F of
both HbI and F97Y HbI but does not affect the backbone NH dynamics
of the second interfacial helix (E) (Figure 4). Thus, both the structure and dynamics of helix F of wild-type
HbI are sensitive to ligand binding. The C-termini of helices F and
G are the regions of the protein whose backbone NH dynamics are affected
the most by ligand binding in both WT and F97Y, but the increased
flexibility observed for helix G upon binding in the WT protein is
not as large in F97Y HbI. In general, we observed that the backbone
NH groups of residues surrounding the heme group become more flexible
upon ligand binding (Figure 4), particularly
in the WT where, for example, the largest increase in flexibility
is observed for the residues of helices E and F that face the heme
group.

The changes in backbone NH dynamics observed upon CO
binding in
WT HbI and F97Y HbI have magnitudes similar to the magnitudes of those
previously observed in human HbA.36 Although
the subunits of HbI and HbA have the same myoglobin fold, their assembly
is very different; thus, HbI and HbA have completely different subunit
interfaces. For this reason, a direct comparison of the dynamics of
the proteins is difficult. The changes in dynamics of the backbone
amide groups observed in HbA upon CO binding exhibit a trend that
is much less uniform than what we observed for HbI and are instead
more randomly distributed along the sequence of the protein. In addition,
several residues on helices G and H were found to be dynamic on a
slow time scale (microsecond to millisecond) as indicated by the need
for a non-zero Rex term in the model-free
analysis.36 In HbA, helices G and H are
located along the intradimer interfaces: α1β1 and α2β2. In HbI, we found
that residues with a non-zero chemical exchange contribution, Rex, to R2 were mostly
located on helices E and F, which are also interfacial helices. These
results suggest that conformational fluctuations occurring on the
microsecond to millisecond time scale at subunit interfaces might
be important in the function of the protein.

Equilibrium thermodynamic
studies of oxygen binding show that HbI
cooperativity is driven by favorable changes in entropy. In this study,
we have probed the backbone dynamics of HbI to investigate the role
of conformational entropy in the cooperative mechanism of carbon monoxide
binding. Several studies have shown that the dynamics of the side
chain are rich and heterogeneous and are often more dramatically affected
by ligand binding than those of the backbone.54 In addition, it has been shown that the side chain dynamics are
uncoupled from those of the backbone.55,56 For these
reasons, it will be important to study the side chain dynamics of
a HbI as well as the backbone to fully characterize the dynamical
changes undergone upon CO binding and to obtain a more accurate estimate
of the changes in protein conformational entropy occurring upon ligand
binding. Nonetheless, although we observed subtle changes in backbone
NH dynamics upon CO binding, from these we obtain an estimate for
the difference in conformational entropy between bound and unbound
states of HbI that indicates a significant contribution to HbI cooperativity
(from the MD simulations, TΔS = 1.8 ± 0.6 kcal/mol). The change in conformational entropy
that we estimate from the MD simulations of F97Y mutant is not as
large as for the WT (TΔS =
1.3 ± 0.6 kcal/mol), which is consistent with the reduced cooperativity
observed for this mutant. This work provides the first direct evidence,
based on both experimental and computational approaches, that changes
in backbone conformational entropy favor HbI cooperativity.

The favorable entropic changes observed in cooperative oxygen binding
in HbI will have contributions from both protein conformational entropy
and solvent entropy. Previous studies of HbI have highlighted the
importance of the interfacial water molecules in the cooperative mechanism
of HbI.13,52 We are currently investigating the coupling
between the change in structure and dynamics of the interfacial helices
(E and F) and of the interfacial water and its role in cooperativity.
These studies will build on our findings presented here that establish
a contribution by protein conformational entropy to HbI ligand binding
cooperativity.
