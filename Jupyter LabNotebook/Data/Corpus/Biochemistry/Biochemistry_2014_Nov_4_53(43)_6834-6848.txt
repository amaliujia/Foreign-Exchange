Aromatic
amino acid hydroxylases
(AAAHs) constitute a family of pterin-dependent monooxygenases, including
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and tryptophan
hydroxylase (TPH).− Mammalian AAAHs share similar structural elements
in that they exist as homotetramers in which each monomeric unit is
comprised of three domains: an N-terminal regulatory domain, a catalytic
domain, and a C-terminal tetramerization domain., The
active site of AAAHs, housed in the catalytic domain of the enzyme,
coordinates with Fe(II) to drive the reaction via a facial catalytic
triad (His, His, and Glu), consistent with 2-His-1-carboxylate triads
found in similar metalloproteins. These
mononuclear non-heme iron(II)-containing enzymes utilize a pterin
cofactor (6R)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and dioxygen to oxidize
target aromatic amino acids. During the
hydroxylation reaction, BH4 is also subjected to a two-electron
oxidation, generating 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin, which is then
recycled to BH4 with the aid of two enzymes. First, 4a-carbinolamine
dehydratase dehydrates 4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin to quinonoid
dihydropterin (dehydration can also proceed nonenzymatically, owing
to a reasonably rapid rate in the absence of enzyme), which, in turn,
is reduced to BH4 by the NADH-dependent enzyme dihydropteridine
reductase (Scheme ).

Hydroxylation of Phenylalanine to Tyrosine by Phenylalanine Hydroxylase
(PAH) Results in Two-Electron Oxidation of the Cofactor, Tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4)
The oxidized form of the cofactor,
4a-hydroxytetrahydrobiopterin, is recycled to BH4 with
the aid of two enzymes, pterin 4a-carbinolamine dehydratase and dihydropteridine
reductase.

In particular, phenylalanine hydroxylase
(PAH) is a crucial metabolic
enzyme responsible for conversion of dietary phenylalanine to tyrosine,
serving two key purposes. Hydroxylation of phenylalanine in eukaryotic
organisms represents the only pathway toward generation of tyrosine,
an amino acid that serves as a precursor for neurotransmitters and as a building block in protein synthesis., Furthermore, organisms with properly functioning PAH avoid detrimental
side reactions that lead to formation of undesirable phenylalanine
derivatives, such as phenylpyruvate, a
scenario that surfaces when phenylalanine accumulates. Phenylketonuria
(PKU), a genetic disease leading to irreversible brain damage in children,
arises in humans when PAH is defective.,

Several
X-ray crystal structures of AAAH family members in complex
with pterin cofactors [PAH from Chromobacterium violaceum (cPAH), human PAH,, human TH, rat TH, and human TPH] illustrate
the contacts that are made with the enzyme upon cofactor binding (Figure a–e), confirming previous proposals that
the pterin binding site is highly conserved among all AAAHs., For example, in cPAH, two loop regions (residues 98–103 and
245–250), the main chain atoms of proline 117, and the side
chains of tyrosine 179 and aspartic acid 139 are involved in pterin
binding. Prior mutational studies of
second-coordination sphere residue Y179 in cPAH and the homologous amino acid Y325 in hPAH indicate that while it has an effect on pterin binding,
its contribution to phenylalanine binding is more pronounced. Furthermore,
another study showed Y325 in hPAH plays a role in stoichiometric binding
of iron and cooperative regulation by phenylalanine.

Acidic residue at position 139 in cPAH that is conserved in mammalian
PAH and in other AAAHs. (a) The crystal structure of cPAH bound to
iron and pterin (PDB entry 1LTZ) shows D139 (yellow) hydrogen bonds with pterin (white)
through three bridging water molecules (red spheres). (b) A similar
water-mediated interaction is observed in the crystal structure of
hPAH in its binary complex (PDB entry 1J8U), which is pushed out in favor of direct
interaction between E286 and pterin (c) when a substrate analogue,
thienylalanine (THA), is bound in the active site (PDB entry 1KW0). (d) Cocrystal
structure of rat tyrosine hydroxylase bound to pterin (PDB entry 2TOH). (e) Cocrystal
structure of tryptophan hydroxylase bound to pterin (PDB entry 1MLW). (f) Sequence alignment
of cPAH, mammalian PAHs, and other AAAHs, showing conservation of
an acidic residue at position 139 in cPAH, which is Glu in most other
AAAHs but Asp in cPAH (blue star, light blue shaded box). Asterisks
indicate Streptomyces coeruleorubidus PAH generates
meta-hydroxylated tyrosine.

The acidic, negatively charged residue at position 139 in
cPAH
is highly conserved among other PAHs, as well as within the entire
AAAH family (Figure f). Interestingly, unlike
the majority of AAAHs in which glutamic acid occupies this position,
in cPAH, the residue in this position is instead aspartic acid. In
the crystal structure of cPAH and an oxidized form of the cofactor,
7,8-dihydrobiopteirn (BH2), three water molecules bridge
the interaction between D139 and the cofactor (Figure a); one of the waters also occupies
a coordination site on iron. On the basis of the crystal structure
of hPAH bound to the fully reduced form of its cofactor, BH4 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1J8U], it is
evident that E286 associates with pterin through two water-mediated
contacts, in a manner similar to that of cPAH D139 (Figure b). Inclusion of thienylalanine (THA), a substrate
analogue for phenylalanine, causes displacement of the bridging water
molecules in the crystal structure (PDB entry 1KW0), resulting in direct hydrogen bonding between E286 and pterin
(Figure c). Furthermore, THA binding in the
active site results in pterin being repositioned 2.6 Å closer
to iron, likely representing its orientation
during the enzyme-catalyzed hydroxylation reaction. In the crystal
structure of oxidized pterin (BH2) in complex with rat
tyrosine hydroxylase, the cofactor adopts a flipped conformation such
that the dihydroxpropyl chain of the cofactor is oriented toward Glu332
(the second-coordination sphere residue analogous to Asp139 in cPAH)
and the water molecules seen bridging pterin and the acidic amino
acid are thus lost (Figure d). Tryptophan hydroxylase (TrpOH) also has been
crystallized with BH2. Like hPAH, TrpOH also binds to BH2 through two water-mediated contacts (Figure e).

With a goal of further
understanding the catalytic contribution
made by the conserved acidic amino acid residing in the second-coordination
sphere of an aromatic amino acid hydroxylase, we investigated mutants
of cPAH aspartic acid 139. The rationale for using cPAH in this study
is based on the following observations. First, despite the fact that,
unlike eukaryotic PAHs, cPAH is a monomeric enzyme consisting of only
a single (catalytic) domain, its structure shares a similar fold with
not only hPAH, but also TH and TPH, therefore
enabling its use as a model for AAAHs in general. Moreover, allosteric
activation by substrate has not been demonstrated in cPAH., However, it should be noted that with the discovery of a second
phenylalanine binding site in cPAH, the
idea that it too may be regulated in some way cannot be ruled out.
We hypothesized that the contribution of this negatively charged residue
to catalysis is multifaceted; the charge could be important in localization
and stabilization of iron, and the charge could be playing a key role
in positioning and stabilizing the cofactor in the transition state.
The corresponding residue in hPAH, E286, has been studied kinetically
using two constructs of hPAH: hPAHN122 and hPAHN102/C24; both studies concluded that E286 was important in
positioning the cofactor., Because E286 forms
a hydrogen bond with one water that also coordinates iron, Dickson
et al. ruled out the possibility that impaired metal binding contributed
to decreased enzymatic activity in their study. Moreover, it has been
proposed that the negative charge of Asp139 could be essential in
the stabilization of the positive charge in the pyrimidine ring of
the peroxy–pterin intermediate. Despite finding the conserved second-coordination sphere Glu/Asp
important in catalysis, no mechanistic insight was gained from these
studies. More importantly, previous studies lacked structural data
in support of the change in water structure that may be associated
with mutation. In this work, we investigated the contribution of Asp139
by generating point mutants (D139N, D139E, D139A, and D139K) to probe
several aspects of cofactor and substrate binding and catalysis. Unlike
previous studies, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to study
binding of ferrous iron, reduced pterin cofactor, and phenylalanine
in the enzyme’s active site. We also used high-resolution X-ray
crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations of mutants to correlate
structural changes in the active site (especially ordered solvent)
with activity.

Methods
Cloning of Mutant Enzymes
All point mutations of cPAH
(D139A, D139N, D139E, D139K, and D139H) were prepared using AccuPower PCR PreMix (Bioneer). The primers used for mutagenesis
were D139A (forward), 5′-GACGTGTTCCACGCCCTGTTCGGCCAC-3′,
D139N (forward), 5′-GACGTGTTCCACAACCTGTTCGGCCAC-3′,
D139K (forward), 5′-GACGTGTTCCACAAACTGTTCGGCCAC-3′,
D139E (forward), 5′-GACGTGTTCCACGAACTGTTCGGCCAC-3′,
and D139H (forward), 5′-GACGTGTTCCACCACCTGTTCGGCCAC-3′
(mismatched nucleotides are represented in boldface and italics).
Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

Protein Expression and
Purification
Wild-type and mutant
cPAH forms were purified from a pET3a vector in the absence of an
affinity tag as described previously., A large-scale
culture was grown to late log phase and induced with 1 mM isopropyl
β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Following induction at
18 °C for 16 h, cells were harvested and lysed via a French press.
The protein was then purified by a combination of anion-exchange chromatography
and size-exclusion chromatography. Enzymes were concentrated, buffer-exchanged
into 50 mM Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), and stored at −80 °C. The
protein concentration was determined via UV–vis spectroscopy.

Kinetics
The hydroxylation of phenylalanine was assayed
using a Shimadzu UV-2501 double-beam spectrophotometer equipped with
a thermostat-controlled cuvette holder by monitoring the production
of tyrosine at 275 nm (ε275 = 1405 L mol–1 cm–1). All assays were conducted at 20 ±
1 °C. The enzyme concentration used in assays varied from 1 μM
wild-type cPAH to 30 μM D139A. Assays also contained a 5-fold
excess of ferrous ammonium sulfate (FeSO4) with respect
to enzyme concentration, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1000 units/mL bovine
catalase, varied concentrations of tetrahydropterin cofactor, 6,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterine
(DMPH4) at saturated Phe (1 mM), and varied concentrations
of Phe at saturated DMPH4 (350 μM), in 0.1 M O2-saturated Na-HEPES (pH 7.4). All assays were conducted in
triplicate, and kinetic data were fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation vi = (Vmax[S])/(KM + [S]) using Kaleidagraph.
Data are given as means ± the standard deviation from three independent
experiments.

Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystallization
of mutants under study was carried out as described previously. Crystals were grown from microseeds of wild-type
protein in 5 μL drops (2 μL of protein, 2 μL of
reservoir solution, 0.4 μL of hexamine cobalt(III) chloride
additive, 0.4 μL of guanidine hydrochloride additive, and 0.2
μL of seeds) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method.
Crystals were cryoprotected by being soaked in 25% ethylene glycol
and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data from mutant crystals
D139A (1.40 Å), D139N (1.35 Å), and D139K (1.35 Å)
were collected on GM/CA beamlines at the Advanced Photon Source at
Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). Diffraction data were collected
on a Mar300 CCD detector (Mar USA) at 100 K and processed utilizing
HKL3000. The crystals contain one molecule
per asymmetric unit and belong to the primitive, triclinic P1 space group.

Structure Determination
The program
molrep from the ccp4 suite was used to determine the structure using a
previously published
structure of apo-cPAH (PDB entry 1LTU). For molrep,
all water molecules and other ions such as iron and chloride were
removed from the aforementioned model to limit model bias. Several
cycles of refinement and model building proceeded using Refmac5 and Coot, respectively.
Anisotropic B factors were used during the refinement
of all D139 mutant structures. Weights were also optimized during
the refinement process. The crystallographic data and refinement statistics
are listed in Table . All figures were rendered
with PYMOL (version 1.5.0.4).

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
We
performed unrestrained
molecular dynamics simulations of 10 systems to investigate cofactor
binding and resulting hydrogen bonding networks in silico. Therefore, we constructed (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin
(BH4)-bound systems for native cPAH and four mutants (D139A,
D139E, D139K, and D139N) by superposition of respective apo structures
with the BH4-bound enzyme (PDB entry 1LTZ). We modeled an unresolved loop region remote from the active
site based on the complete D139E structure (residues 126–134).
We discarded bound ethylene glycol residues as well as water molecules
showing van der Waals clashes with the cofactor in the modeled complex
(r = 1.5 Å). On the basis of these five systems,
we built 10 topologies in complex with Fe(II) and Co(II) ions. After
protein preparation using protonate3d, systems were solvated in a truncated octahedral box of TIP4P water
molecules with a minimal wall distance of 8.0 Å. The D139K mutants were prepared with a neutral lysine residue
to allow coordination to the metal ions.

Simulations were performed
using the GPU implementation of pmemd in AMBER14. Protein atoms were described
using the AMBER force field 99SB-ILDN, and the cofactor BH4 was parametrized in the Generalized
Amber Force Field (GAFF) in analogy to
earlier studies of BH2-bound PAH., Atomic point charges for BH4 were derived by RESP fitting
at the Hartree–Fock 6/31G* level in Gaussian03. van der Waals parameters for Fe(II) were taken
from an earlier study and fit for Co(II)
by a distance scan against a helium atom (r = 1.25
Å; ε = 0.014 kcal mol–1 cm–1). Simulations were performed in the NpT ensemble
at 300 K and 1.0 bar employing a 8.0 Å nonbonded cutoff. The
SHAKE algorithm allowed use of a time
step of 2 fs. After an extensive equilibration protocol had been employed, unrestrained sampling was conducted for 100
ns, thereby saving 50000 equally spaced snapshots for subsequent analysis.

Analysis of trajectories was performed using ptraj and cpptraj. After ensuring the stability of the simulations,
we extracted direct and solvent-mediated hydrogen bonds between residue
139 and BH4 using cpptraj’s default criteria (d &lt; 3.0 Å; α &lt; 135°). Solvation was
characterized by analysis of water positions in a cube with an edge
length of 2.0 Å centered on initial water positions of the native
systems. Interaction energies between residue 139 and BH4 were calculated from nonbonded interactions of all atom pairs, thus
summing electrostatic and van der Waals contributions. Error bars
were calculated from splitting the trajectory in 10 parts of 10 ns.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
All isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) experiments were conducted anaerobically under an
argon atmosphere at 25 °C using a GE/MicroCal ITC200 calorimeter as described previously. In experiments aimed to measure the affinity of cPAH and its mutants
for its native metal, Fe(II), 500 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate
was prepared in dialysis buffer containing 2.5 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP) and titrated into a 50 μM solution of protein also including
2.5 mM TCEP. TCEP was used to keep iron reduced. FeSO4 solutions
used in tetrahydropterin and phenylalanine binding experiments were
prepared in 10 mM HCl to keep iron in its reduced state. Prior to
initiation of the binding experiment, protein samples containing Fe(II)
were spotted on pH paper to ensure that the overall sample pH had
not been altered as a result of spiking the sample with iron prepared
in HCl. To gauge the effect of mutation on binding of tetrahydropterin
cofactor BH4, 1–5 mM solutions of (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride (BH4) were
titrated into a 50 μM solution of protein containing 50 μM
FeSO4. BH4 was used in ITC in favor of the same
form of pterin used in kinetics because the binding isotherms for
DMPH4 were very poor (refer to Figure 1 of the  for a comparison of pterins
used in this study). For experiments in which phenylalanine was titrated
into the reconstituted enzyme, 1 mM Phe was titrated into 50 μM
protein, 50 μM FeSO4, and 200 μM BH4.

A total of 18 injections, 2 μL/injection, with 180
s between injections, were performed for cPAH and the mutants (D139A,
D139K, D139N, and D139E). The data were baseline-corrected with NITPIC and analyzed using the one-site model in SEDPHAT., Figures were prepared using GUSSI.

Results
Steady-State
Kinetic Analyses of Asp139 Point Mutations
To understand
the contribution of the second-coordination sphere
residue aspartic acid 139, steady-state kinetic analysis was carried
out for the point mutants D139E, D139N, and D139A. The Glu mutation
was made because most AAAHs contain a Glu, not Asp, in this position.
To explore the importance of the negative charge and/or polarity from
this residue, we mutated Asp to the uncharged, yet polar, Asn and
to the positively charged residue, Lys. The Ala mutant was generated
to probe the effect of a complete loss of hydrogen bonding and charge
in the side chain. We also prepared a His mutant; however, this mutant
proved to be insoluble and could not be purified. The kinetic parameters
determined for the mutants are significantly different from those
of the wild-type enzyme (Table ). The KM values for DMPH4 [an analogue of
BH4 widely used in kinetic experiments (Figure 1 of the )] and l-Phe are
slightly higher with respect to the wild-type enzyme in D139E, D139N,
and D139A; however, the difference is not very significant and does
not necessitate distinction from the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, kcat values for the D139 point mutants are markedly
lower than those obtained for the wild-type enzyme; the kcat for D139E is 10-fold lower than that of wild-type
cPAH, while the kcat values for D139N
and D139A are 16- and 100-fold lower, respectively.

D139K						
Kinetic parameters for D139K could
not be determined.

The second-order
rate constants, kcat/KM, indicate that all three mutants
are catalytically less efficient in conversion of phenylalanine to
tyrosine than the wild-type protein. The kcat/KM data for the substrate DMPH4 reveal decreases of 14-, 25-, and 158-fold in D139E, D139N, and
D139A, respectively. Furthermore, the values of kcat/KM determined for phenylalanine
reveal decreases of 7-, 17-, and 81-fold in D139E, D139N, and D139A
mutants, respectively.

The ability of cPAH to catalyze the hydroxylation
reaction was
dramatically impaired in the D139K mutant. We attempted to obtain
steady-state kinetic parameters for this mutant; however, nonenzymatic
amounts of protein were required to achieve minimal product formation
of tyrosine. Therefore, this mutant is deemed inactive.

Iron Binding
in Asp139 Mutants
The substantial changes
we observed in kcat as a result of mutation
of aspartic acid 139 in cPAH raised the possibility that destabilization
of iron binding in the active site could be contributing to the reduction
in enzymatic activity. We used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)
as a direct measurement of iron binding in the active site. To prevent
the oxidation of iron, these experiments were conducted in an anaerobic
glovebox under an argon atmosphere with 2.5 mM TCEP. Experiments performed
in the absence of TCEP resulted in poor binding, probably because
of some oxidation of iron (data not shown). Dissociation constants
and thermodynamic parameters obtained from iron titration experiments
with wild-type cPAH and aspartic acid 139 mutants are summarized in
Table .

Titration of a 10-fold excess of FeSO4 into
wild-type
apo-cPAH at 25 °C produced a binding isotherm that could be satisfactorily
fit to a one-site model yielding a dissociation constant (Kd) value of 151 ± 28 nM and an NITC (measure of stoichiometry between protein
and ligand) value of 0.8 (Figure  and Table ). Comparatively, titration of iron into the D139N
mutant yielded a Kd value of 139 ±
62 nM, indicating that the metal binding ability of the enzyme was
not lost as a result of mutation. However, mutation of aspartic acid
139 to glutamate and alanine shows a moderate impairment of iron binding
(Figure  and Table ), corresponding to an approximate 4-fold increase in Kd for D139E and a 6-fold increase in Kd for D139A. Despite this reduction in metal binding affinity,
we hypothesize that because excess iron was added to the enzyme during
our steady-state kinetic analysis, the majority of active sites were
metalated and therefore did not contribute to the observed reduced
activity of the mutants. Furthermore, wild-type cPAH and all three
mutants shared similar positive entropy (ΔS) values (16–24 cal mol–1). This observed
increase in entropy is consistent with that demonstrated in a prior
metal binding study with cPAH from which
it was concluded that discharge of water from the active site leading
to iron coordination is the cause of the increased entropy upon metalation.
This suggests that the water networks in the immediate vicinity of
the metal are similar in the D139N, D139A, and D139E mutants to that
of the wild-type enzyme.

Representative ITC binding thermograms for binding
of Fe(II) to
(a) wild-type cPAH, (b) D139N, (c) D139A, (d) D139E, and (e) D139K.
The experiments were performed in an oxygen-free glovebox under an
argon atmosphere to prevent oxidation of iron.

We attempted to obtain a dissociation constant for iron binding
in the active site of the D139K mutant by titrating a solution containing
a 10-fold excess of FeSO4, yet no binding was observed
(Figure 2 of the ). Titration of a solution containing a 20-fold excess of FeSO4 generated a very weak, endothermic binding isotherm and a Kd of 76.5 ± 0.7 μM correlating to
an ∼500-fold reduction in binding affinity for iron (Figure  and Table ). From this
experiment, it is clear that the effect of the lysine mutation leads
to destabilization of iron. This result also explains why we are unable
to obtain kinetic information for this mutant: its ability to bind
iron in the active site is significantly impaired. Assuming that the
other substrates (phenylalanine and pterin) can still bind the active
site in a productive orientation, the hydroxylation reaction would
not be catalyzed by an enzyme deficient in iron.

Cofactor and
Substrate Binding
Because the crystal
structure of cPAH in the ternary complex (bound to both iron and its
cofactor, pterin) implicates aspartic acid 139 in pterin binding via
three water-mediated interactions (PDB entry 1LTZ), we again utilized ITC to assess each mutant’s ability
to bind (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin dihydrochloride
(BH4) to the Fe(II)-bound enzyme (see ). As in the iron binding experiments, to keep BH4 in its reduced state binding experiments were conducted in
an anaerobic glovebox under an argon atmosphere. The dissociation
constants and thermodynamic parameters are listed in Table .

The values for binding of wild-type
cPAH to both BH4 and l-Phe were obtained in a
previous study.

In a previous study, we determined the Kd for binding of BH4 to iron-reconstituted
wild-type cPAH
to be 24 ± 2 μM. Titration
of D139N and D139A mutant cPAH enzymes, containing iron-reconstituted
active sites (see ), with a 100-fold
excess of BH4 yielded Kd values
corresponding to approximate 5- and 16-fold decreased binding affinities,
respectively (Figure  and Table ). The data were fit agreeably to a one-site binding model,
yielding NITC values of 1 for each mutant,
indicating that both mutants bind BH4 in a 1:1 stoichiometry.
Unexpectedly, even though the D139E mutant suffered an impairment
in its ability to catalyze tyrosine formation, our ITC experiments
revealed that it binds pterin approximately 6-fold tighter than the
wild-type enzyme (Table  and Figure ).

in their reduced form, experiments were conducted under an argon atmosphere.
Titration of BH4 with D139K failed to generate a binding
isotherm.

We also observed some interesting
entropic changes with the Glu
mutant in comparison to the wild-type enzyme upon BH4 binding.
The mutant experienced a positive change in entropy larger than that
of the wild-type enzyme, with a ΔS of 7.4 cal
mol–1 K–1, as compared to a negligible
change in ΔS for the wild-type enzyme (−0.4
cal mol–1 K–1) upon BH4 binding (Table ). Although such a change
could mean that the mutant is more solvated in the pterin binding
site than the wild type, it could also be taken as an indication that
more ordered water molecules have been expelled from the local environment
of the Glu side chain to accommodate BH4 binding.,

We attempted to obtain a dissociation constant for binding
of BH4 in the D139K mutant but did not observe a binding
isotherm
for this reaction (Figure 2 of the ). Interestingly, mutation of aspartic acid 139
to lysine results in a loss of the enzyme’s ability to bind
not only iron (as discussed above) but also BH4, which
may explain why this mutant no longer behaves as a catalyst for hydroxylation
of phenylalanine (Table ).

We conducted
phenylalanine binding experiments to rule out the
possibility that changing the side chain of a residue implicated in
cofactor binding can also affect the enzyme’s ability to bind
substrate. These experiments were conducted anaerobically, in which
a 20-fold excess of phenylalanine was titrated into a solution containing
iron-reconstituted cPAH and excess BH4. As expected, we
did not notice a change in phenylalanine binding in D139N, D139A,
D139E, or D139K (Figure  and Table ). It is interesting to note that despite having
little affinity for iron or BH4, the D139K mutant binds
phenylalanine with the same affinity as wild-type cPAH. These data
rule out the idea that the decreased enzyme efficiency seen with D139A
and D139N mutants could be the result of impaired phenylalanine binding
and also indicate that the presence of a cofactor and/or iron in the
active site does not contribute to phenylalanine binding.

Molecular dynamics simulations allowed estimation of the
interaction
energies between residue 139 and the cofactor BH4 (see
Figure 3 of the ).
We found strong favorable interactions in the native system and the
D139E mutant with interaction energies ranging from −3.3 and
−5.8 kcal/mol correlating with experimental binding affinities.
Interactions in the D139K mutant are slightly favorable, whereas molecular
interactions in mutants D139A and D139N are consistently repulsive
with energies in the range of 0.3–1.3 kcal/mol. Presented values
reflect only direct interactions between the residues; thus, effects
on water networks are not captured as are effects of deprotonation,
which is expected for the neutral lysine side chain in mutant D139K.

Solvation Changes in the Active Site
To understand
the effect of each mutation on the local active site environment,
especially with respect to changes in the water network of the pterin
binding pocket, we obtained high-resolution X-ray crystal structures
of each mutant. Crystallographic data are summarized in Table . Crystals of D139N and D139K diffracted to 1.35
Å resolution, while crystals of D139A and D139E diffracted to
1.40 Å resolution. Molecular replacement was employed to determine
the structures, utilizing a previously determined apo-cPAH structure
(PDB entry 1LTU) as a search model, with waters deleted.
As described previously, cobalt was modeled
into electron density representing bound metal coordinated in the
active site by residues His138, His143, and Glu184. Crystallographic
data for D139N were refined to Rcrys and Rfree values of 16.2 and 20.0%, respectively
(Table ). The free R factors
for D139A, D139E, and D139K were within 3.6–4.0% of crystallographic R factors.

As discussed earlier, the pterin cofactor
is known to bind to cPAH through several side chain contacts, one
of which is mediated through three interactions of water with aspartic
acid 139. Because the overall crystal structures for the mutants were
almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, we focused our analysis
on the pterin binding pocket of the active site. A hydrogen bond network
consisting of waters 1–10 (Figure a,
PDB entry 3TK4) bridges the active site metal with
the carboxylate group of Asp139, the carbonyl group of Pro117, the
hydroxyl group of Tyr179, and the carboxylate of E184 (which also
coordinates the metal in a bidentate fashion). Because of improved
resolution, water molecules constituting this network have been assigned
on the basis of the 1.5 Å resolution crystal structure of cPAH
bound to Co instead of the 2.0 Å
structure of it bound to Fe (PDB entry 1LTV). Binding
of pterin in the active site (PDB entry 1LTZ) induces a displacement of waters 6 and
7, due to a steric clash with the O4 atom of the pterin moiety. Waters
9 and 10 are also lost to accommodate the dihydroxypropyl chain of
pterin, while a new water molecule is seen hydrogen bonding with both
waters 1 and 8 (Figure b,c). Since we were
unable to obtain structures of the mutants in the pterin-bound state,
we focused our analysis on the solvation state of the mutants in their
metalated form, prior to binding of the cofactor (Figure ). The B factors for waters contributing
to the hydrogen bonding network in the pterin pocket are listed in
Table S1 of the .

model and accordingly refining the model in Phenix, using simulated annealing parameters in which the protein was heated
to 5000 K and subsequently cooled to 300 K in 50 steps at a rate of
100 K/step. (a) The water network for D139E loses water 8 and sees
water 3 replaced with ethylene glycol, while (b) the D139N water network
is largely unperturbed. (c) In D139A, waters 12 and 15 appear, although
the occupancy for water 15 is quite weak. (d) In D139K, the water
network is disrupted by loss of water 3, while water 2 is displaced
by the ε-amino group of lysine, which coordinates the active
site metal. The corresponding 2Fo – Fc map after refinement is shown in Figure 6
of the .

are Fo – Fc simulated annealing omit maps contoured at 3σ.

The crystal structure of D139E
revealed it also retained two of
the three waters implicated in pterin binding (Figure a). The waters were in the same location as in wild-type cPAH,
one that hydrogen bonds with the metal (water 2) and the other forming
a 3.0 Å hydrogen bond with the N3 atom of the pteridine ring
(water 4). D139E assumes an orientation that positions the carboxylate
group away from the metal; the effect of this is registered on the
third water, which was displaced by ethylene glycol (used as the cryoprotectant)
and moved 2 Å from its normal location to prevent a steric clash
with glutamate. In aqueous solution, it can be assumed that water
would occupy the position taken by ethylene glycol. When water in
the D139E structure is modeled in this position with the pterin-bound
crystal structure (PDB entry 1LTZ), the distance between that water and the NH2 group of pterin is just 1.3 Å (Figure 4 of the ), indicating that pterin
must bind to this enzyme differently or this water would be lost upon
its binding. Loss of such an ordered water molecule may contribute,
at least in part, to the entropic change we observed upon BH4 binding
via ITC.

Interestingly, D139N retains two waters in the exact
same location
(Figure b), one that coordinates with the
metal directly (water 2) and another (water 4) that presumably hydrogen
bonds with the N3 atom in the pteridine ring at a distance of 2.8
Å. The third water (water 3), which forms a 3.3 Å hydrogen
bond with asparagine, while still present, has shifted because the
asparagine side chain has adopted an orientation slightly different
from that of aspartic acid (the Fo – Fc map contoured at 3.0σ shows weak, but
discernible, density for this water, indicating it was somewhat less
tightly bound than other clearly visible ones).

Unexpectedly,
in D139A, all three waters required for pterin binding
were present in the same location as wild-type cPAH, despite a lack
of hydrogen bonding partners through side chain contacts at position
139 (Figure c). Like the D139E active site,
the crystal structure reveals that the active site for the D139A mutant
has more water molecules than that of the wild-type enzyme, presumably
because of the cavity created upon the mutation. In the D139A mutant,
we observed a positive entropic change, ΔS,
in ITC experiments upon binding of pterin to D139A, consistent with
the crystallographic observation of a more solvated active site.

The crystal structure of D139K reveals that the lysine mutant lacks
several waters from the water network. Most noticeably, water 2, which
normally coordinates the metal, has been displaced by lysine, which
now ligates the metal (Figure d; see below).
Waters 3 and 6 are also absent from the water network of the lysine
mutant. The absence of waters 2 and 3, water molecules that normally
bridge Asp and the cofactor, may contribute to the lack of binding
seen via ITC, because these waters are needed to stabilize pterin
in the active site prior to substrate binding.

Molecular dynamics
trajectories allow investigation of the hydrogen
bonding and water network in the cPAH active site in the presence
of BH4. We observed strong water-bridged hydrogen bonding
between residue 139 and the cofactor in the native system with occupancies
of 0.91 and 0.80 for the Fe(II)- and Co(II)-bound systems, respectively.
Mutations are consistently found to weaken these interactions. Mutants
D139E, D139K, and D139N reduce water-bridged hydrogen bonding to occupancies
between 0.05 and 0.37, while D139A in the absence of polar atoms in
the side chain shows no hydrogen bonding at all. Direct hydrogen bonding
between BH4 and residue 139 is not observed in the native
state. Larger amino acids in mutants D139E and D139K allow some direct
interactions in both metal-bound states with occupancies between 0.014
and 0.068.

Changes in hydrogen bonding networks are reflected
in alterations
in water occupancies (see Figure 5 of the ). High occupancies for most water positions in
native cPAH are reduced in mutated systems. Coordination to the active
site metal prohibits the presence of water 2 in the D139K mutant.
We observe partial direct coordination of the side chain carboxylate
in D139E with Fe(II); thus, the occupancy of water 2 is reduced similarly.
In agreement with data from the D139A crystal structure, we identify
a new water positions (water 15) for mutants with small side chains
(D139A and D139N). Binding of this additional water molecule is facilitated
by hydrogen bonding of the side chain carboxamide to the carbonyl
oxygen of D135 [occupancies of 0.69 and 0.78 for Fe(II)- and Co(II)-bound
systems, respectively]. This additional hydrogen bond attracts the
side chain, thereby creating space for incorporation of an additional
water molecule.

Lysine 139 Coordinates the Active Site Metal
Clear
electron density of the ε-amino group of lysine in the D139K
crystal structure was seen occupying a coordination site on the active
site metal (Figure d), resulting in displacement
of a water molecule that normally ligates the metal. Octahedral coordination
of the metal is still achieved, despite a loss of this water molecule,
because the other ligands remain in place. Remarkably, mutation of
Asp139 to lysine resulted in it assuming the role of a first-coordination
sphere ligand of the active site metal, instead of its usual role
in the enzyme’s second-coordination sphere (as a residue that
is indirectly attached to a metal’s ligand, in this case, water).
Of added interest is the fact that, despite a complete lack of activity
and, most importantly, significantly impaired iron binding as judged
by ITC, strong density in the 2Fo – Fc map corresponding to bound metal is visible
in the active site. One possible explanation for this is that the
lysine mutant has greater affinity for an inhibitory metal such as
cobalt (used in the crystallization buffer) rather than iron. Alternatively, the metal-bound species of the
Lys mutant could be a minor population in solution, but one that has
crystallized preferentially over the major, nonmetalated species.
The kinetic and binding results with the lysine mutant may reflect
a steric clash with the cofactor, despite our observation in crystals
that it could be oriented toward the metal center. In solution, in
the presence of the native metal, the side chain of lysine may not
be engaged completely or at all with the metal, as indicated by ITC
data, and can prevent cofactor binding either by direct steric clash
or by preventing the formation of the water bridge.

This observation
was striking since lysine is widely regarded as a poor ligand for
metals. Typically, coordination of lysine with active site metals
occurs in one of two ways: either through its backbone carbonyl oxygen
atom or through a carbamylated lysine (a post-translational modification
in which lysine’s ε-amino group is carboxylated)., In fact, direct coordination of the ε-amino group with a transition
metal is rare. One such example is the 1.6 Å crystal structure
of the zinc metalloprotein leucine amino peptidase (PDB entry 1LAM), which reveals a binuclear zinc active site in which one
of the zinc atoms is ligated by a nearby lysine (Figure 7 of the ). Both the 3.0 and 1.95
Å crystal structures of ubiquitin (PDB entry 3H1U) and lysine 63-linked diubiquitin (PDB entry 2JF5) reveal that one of the surface lysine residues of ubiquitin
(Lys29) can coordinate cadmium (Figure 7 of the ). Similar to the D139K mutant of cPAH
described in the present study, artifactual lysine metal coordination
has also been observed in other systems, such as by replacement of
the copper-coordinating methionine in amicyanin with lysine, yielding
an enzyme that binds zinc instead of copper (PDB entry 3RYM), and by mutation of the axial heme iron methionine ligand
in a bacterial cytochrome c550 enzyme,
leading to coordination of the amino group of lysine with the heme
iron (PDB entry 2BH5).

Discussion
The
high-resolution crystal structure of cPAH in complex with the
oxidized form of its cofactor, BH2, in addition to crystal structures of other AAAHs,−,, shows an acidic amino acid in the enzyme’s second coordination
sphere engaged in numerous hydrogen bonding interactions. Specifically,
in cPAH the carboxylate of D139 lies 4.2 Å from the iron; however,
it utilizes a water molecule near the iron to form hydrogen bonds
both with iron and with the O4 atom of BH2. Likewise, the
equivalent residues in human PAH (E286), rat TH (E332), and human
TPH (E273) all reside 4.4 Å from the active site iron. Because
this residue is located close to the metal, it is reasonable to propose
that the charge it carries has a role in catalysis, perhaps through
stabilization of iron. We used ITC as a measure of direct metal binding
in the active site of wild-type cPAH and the D139 mutants studied
here. Replacing a carboxylate side chain with a carboxamide group
(D139N) does not appear to have an effect with respect to metal binding
(if anything, the protein’s affinity for iron was slightly
improved). However, removal of the polar atoms from the side chain
completely through the introduction of alanine at position 139 in
cPAH impairs the enzyme’s ability to bind iron. While the presence
of a polar side chain at position 139 seems to be important for metal
binding, the size of the side chain is also important. Introduction
of an additional CH2 and thus increasing the side chain’s
conformational entropy by mutating Asp to Glu lead to a decreased
affinity for iron even though the charge is the same. This is consistent
with the side chain playing a role in binding the metal, but the charge
is not the only important factor in this binding.

The aforementioned
crystal structure of cPAH in complex with BH2 shows three
hydrogen bonds, bridged by three water molecules,
between D139 and the NH2, N3, and O4 atoms in the pteridine
ring of BH2, suggesting that D139 contributes to catalysis
by properly orienting the cofactor. Previous kinetic studies of the
D139 equivalent residue in two different N-terminal regulatory domain-deleted
constructs of hPAH led to the conclusion that this residue plays a
key role in positioning of the cofactor for catalysis., One of the studies found that mutation
of E286 to alanine led to an increase in KM for pterin, while mutation to glutamine did not change the KM of pterin. Our kinetic results (Table ) do not reflect a change in the KM of pterin in D139A or D139N; however, a drastic change
in kcat was observed in each mutant. To
understand how changes in polarity and charge to D139 affected pterin
binding, we used ITC to directly measure each mutant’s affinity
for pterin. These studies indicate that the negative charge conveyed
by the Asp residue contributes to stronger binding with the cofactor,
possibly through strong hydrogen bonding with the bridging waters.
The trend observed in pterin binding in the wild-type enzyme and the
D139N and D139A mutants mirrored the trend in kcat values; however, the magnitude of the change in kcat is significantly more substantial than the
effect on pterin affinity. A possible explanation for the enhanced
binding ability in the D139E mutant for BH4 is that the
cofactor has bound somewhat directly to the side chain, instead of
indirectly through water-mediated contacts. Molecular dynamics data
support this view by showing stronger intermolecular interactions
and some extent of direct hydrogen bonding. If this is so, it may
explain why the D139E enzyme is less active than the wild-type enzyme;
the elimination of some water-mediated contacts in favor of direct
contacts between the cofactor and the glutamate side chain leading
to tighter binding between the two could mean that the cofactor is
trapped in an arrangement making it more difficult to undergo the
transition to the productive orientation required for catalysis in
the presence of Phe. Alternatively, it could also mean that the cofactor
is likely assuming an orientation similar to the productive form of
pterin binding in the absence of phenylalanine. This repositioning
of the cofactor in the active site is counterproductive for the enzyme
because typically hydroxylation of phenylalanine to tyrosine is tightly
coupled with oxidation of the cofactor; however, a second, uncoupled,
pathway is known to occur without forming product, in which BH4 can be directly oxidized to quinonoid dihydropterin, generating
H2O2. This effect
was observed in a previous study of PAH mutants that induce PKU and other studies using analogues of the substrate
or cofactor.,

Altogether, our results
seem to indicate that the conserved acidic
side chain plays a more prominent role in stabilizing the transition
state by placing pterin in a productive orientation with respect to
the metal center, most likely by direct hydrogen bonding. Such hydrogen
bonding involving the negative charge on the side chain could make
a more substantial contribution to pterin binding than indirect interactions
involving the bridging waters. These results are also consistent with
a model of pterin hydroxylation that proposes that the carboxylate
group of E286 (D139 in cPAH) may function to “stabilize the
positive charge delocalized in the pyrimidine ring of the peroxy–pterin
intermediate.”

Our results
highlight the importance of the bridging water molecules
in catalysis. The placement of these water molecules between the side
chain of Asp139 and the cofactor prevents direct contact between the
two, presumably preventing uncoupled hydroxylation of the cofactor.
It is interesting to note that these bridging water molecules, although
supported by Asp139, are more dependent on the metal for their existence
(the crystal structures of the Asn and Ala mutants show many of these
are retained). This dependence on the metal, particularly on one of
the waters that is directly coordinated to it, confers a distinct
advantage: when oxygen binds, it would displace the key water from
the coordination sphere of the metal, which would deform the network
of hydrogen bonds, leading to facile expulsion of the bridging waters
en route to the transition state. After completion of the reaction
cycle, the water structure around the metal and the acidic side chain
would be reestablished. These intervening waters would weaken the
oxidized cofactor, leading to its departure from the active site.
Thus, the bridging waters may also facilitate release of the oxidized
cofactor.

Molecular dynamics data strengthen these hypotheses,
as we observe
a strong hydrogen bonding network in the native system, including
solvent-bridged hydrogen bonds between residue 139 and the cofactor.
Mutations to larger residues (D139E and D139K) partially break the
formed water structures, partially compensated by direct hydrogen
bonding between the cofactor and the amino acid side chain. These
additional interactions might impair release of the oxidized cofactor.

In conclusion, we have shown that the mutations of aspartic acid
139 in the second coordination sphere of cPAH do not affect the enzyme’s
ability to bind its substrate, phenylalanine, but instead influence
both iron and cofactor binding. Previously, it was suggested that
an inhibitory complex forms between hPAH and BH4 requiring
its own dissociation prior to phenylalanine activation. Along those lines, recently a kinetic study
by Roberts et al. proposed that PAH can
form two different pterin complexes: one that orients BH4 in an unproductive form and another that orients it in a catalytically
productive form. Our studies are in agreement with this idea. The
acidic amino acid is essential to proper enzymatic function, because
it not only is important in stabilizing the cofactor properly through
bridging water molecules in the ground state (unproductive form) but
also plays an important role in stabilizing the putative peroxy–pterin
intermediate in the transition state.
