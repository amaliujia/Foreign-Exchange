NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase
(complex I) is a complicated, multisubunit, membrane-bound enzyme
that is crucial for respiration in many aerobic organisms. In mitochondria,
complex I oxidizes NADH in the mitochondrial matrix, reduces ubiquinone
in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and uses the free energy from
the redox reaction to translocate protons across the membrane, contributing
to the proton motive force. Complex I
is also a major source of reactive oxygen species in mitochondria,
and its dysfunctions are being increasingly implicated in neurodegenerative
diseases and mitochondrial disorders.

Mitochondrial complex I comprises two domains: a hydrophobic domain
that is embedded in the inner membrane and a hydrophilic domain that
protrudes into the matrix., NADH is oxidized by
a flavin mononucleotide cofactor in the hydrophilic domain, and the
electrons are then passed along a “chain” of iron–sulfur
(FeS) clusters to the ubiquinone binding site, located close to the
interface with the hydrophobic domain. All complexes I contain eight
conserved FeS clusters: two [2Fe–2S] clusters and six [4Fe–4S]
clusters.,, An additional
[4Fe–4S] cluster is present in a small number of prokaryotes, but not in any known mitochondrial complex I, so it is not discussed
further here. The eight conserved clusters are ligated by a set of
conserved sequence motifs;, they have been defined
structurally in the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus complex I and observed also in an electron
density map of complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica.

The FeS clusters in the complexes
I from a number of species have
been characterized extensively by X-band EPR spectroscopy. Oxidized
[2Fe–2S] and [4Fe–4S] clusters are diamagnetic, and
so no signals are observed in the EPR spectrum of oxidized complex
I. When the enzyme is reduced by NADH, the signals from five reduced
clusters are observed., The five signals observed in spectra
from the mitochondrial enzymes are named N1b, N2, N3, N4, and N5;
how to assign them to the eight now structurally defined clusters
has been much debated and only became clear recently.,− Signal N1b is a slow-relaxing signal from the [2Fe–2S]
cluster in the 75 kDa subunit (assigned because the same signal is
exhibited by overexpressed 75 kDa subunit homologues,,). Here, we use the nomenclature
from complex I from Bos taurus, the enzyme best studied
by EPR; the cluster with signal N1b is named 2Fe[75]. The remaining
four signals are from faster-relaxing [4Fe–4S] clusters. Interactions
between the cluster that exhibits signal N3 and the flavosemiquinone
radical, and the cluster that exhibits
signal N2 and the ubisemiquinone radical, showed that N3 is from the [4Fe–4S] cluster in the 51 kDa
subunit, 4Fe[51], and N2 is from the [4Fe–4S] cluster in the
PSST subunit, 4Fe[PS]., Signal N5 is from the 75 kDa
subunit and N4 is from the TYKY subunit because overexpressed homologues of the 75 kDa subunit exhibit signal
N5, but not signal N4; the results from site-directed mutagenesis
were used to assign N5 to the all-cysteine ligated cluster, 4Fe[75]C. Recently, signal N4 was assigned to the “first”
cluster in TYKY, 4Fe[TY]1, using double electron electron resonance.The FeS clusters in complex
I and the EPR signals (exhibited by the NADH-reduced mitochondrial
enzymes) that are assigned to them are summarized in Figure ; the clusters that are reduced by NADH correspond
to positions 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 in the seven-cluster chain between
the two active sites.

FeS clusters in mitochondrial complex I and their corresponding
EPR signals. The FeS cluster arrangement is from the structure of
the hydrophilic arm of complex I from T. thermophilus; the “N7” cluster (non-conserved)
has been deleted. The clusters are named according to their cluster
type and subunit location in B. taurus complex I
(black), and the EPR signals (N1b, N2, N3, N4, and N5, red) that are
exhibited by the NADH-reduced mitochondrial enzyme are indicated next
to the clusters that they have been assigned to;, clusters
in gray do not contribute to the EPR spectrum of NADH-reduced mitochondrial
complex I. The distances between the clusters are the distances between
the centers of the two closest atoms.

Here, we aim to determine the status of the three
clusters that
are not observed as reduced clusters in the EPR spectrum of NADH-reduced
complex I (clusters 2Fe[24], 4Fe[75]H, and 4Fe[TY]2, see Figure ). Are these clusters oxidized or reduced in the
NADH-reduced enzyme, and if they are reduced, why are they not observed
in EPR analyses? It has been suggested that they are reduced but not
apparent in spectra due to spin-coupling between the clusters, that the signals are so fast relaxing that they
are too broad to be distinguished, or
that they exhibit higher spin states so are not observed in the g ∼ 2 region. Furthermore,
there are two areas of particular confusion in the literature. First,
the signal from cluster 2Fe[24], N1a, is exhibited by the dithionite-reduced,
overexpressed 24 kDa subunit from the B. taurus enzyme
and its homologues and also by the dithionite-reduced
“flavoprotein subcomplex” of B. taurus complex I., Signal N1a is clearly distinct
from signal N1b (in particular, the gz values for N1a and N1b are ∼2.004 and ∼2.024,
respectively), so it is clear that N1a
is not present in spectra from the NADH-reduced mitochondrial enzymes.
In contrast, cluster 2Fe[24] in Escherichia coli complex
I is readily reduced by NADH (it is known to have a higher reduction
potential), and in this case, both signals
N1a and N1b are observed., Nevertheless, confusion
has arisen because it has been suggested that (an altered) signal
N1a is hidden by N1b in the spectra from the NADH-reduced mitochondrial
enzymes (suggesting that the 2Fe[24] cluster can be
reduced by NADH).,, Second, the reduction potentials of the clusters that give rise
to signals N1b, N2, N3, N4, and N5 in mitochondrial complex I were
measured in redox titrations.,− Signal N2 exhibits a relatively high potential (−0.05 to
−0.15 V), whereas the N1b, N3, N4, and N5 EPR signals were
all reported to exhibit similar reduction potentials of around −0.25
V. The four clusters giving rise to these signals were thus described
as “isopotential”, and (before the number of FeS clusters
in complex I was confirmed structurally) it became common practice
to describe all the chain of clusters between the flavin and cluster
4Fe[PS] (N2) as isopotential. Unfortunately, this practice has survived
the fact that there are six clusters between the flavin and cluster
4Fe[PS] (N2), not four—the idea that all six clusters are isopotential has been used widely as the basis for
modeling of electron transfer kinetics and electrostatic effects,
relevant to elucidating the role of intramolecular electron transfer
in energy transduction by complex I.− Part of the problem is that, despite the complete lack of any positive
evidence for the isopotential hypothesis, there is little direct evidence
against it either: reduction of complex I to −1 V using a EuII reagent revealed additional spectral features that suggest
the NADH-reduced enzyme is not fully reduced but failed to reveal any new signals that could be assigned to specific
clusters either.

Here, we use Mössbauer spectroscopy
to define the proportion
of reduced and oxidized clusters in mitochondrial complex I from Y. lipolytica (a eukaryotic model enzyme with very similar
spectroscopic properties to the B. taurus enzyme)
cultured on iron-57 and reduced by NADH. The Mössbauer technique
is sensitive to all the FeS clusters present, regardless of their
oxidation states, and thus offers a direct route to determine the
proportion of oxidized and reduced clusters.

Experimental Procedures
Preparation of Isotopically Labeled Yarrowia lipolytica Complex I
Samples of 56Fe complex I were prepared
from Y. lipolytica strain GB10 as described previously.− Samples of 57Fe complex I were prepared following the
same procedure, except that the cells were grown in synthetic medium
(pH 5.5) containing 0.69% yeast nitrogen base without iron (ForMedium,
UK), 4% glucose, 0.7% sodium glutamate, 0.08% Complete Supplement
Mixture (ForMedium), and 650 μg L–1 57FeSO4. 57FeSO4 was prepared by dissolving 57Fe (&gt;97% purity, CKGas Ltd.) in 300 mM H2SO4 overnight, in contact with a Pt wire to catalyze H+ reduction; the solution was corrected to pH 5.5 with 1 M Tris-Cl
(pH 7.5), and the iron concentration was determined using ferrene., The buffer used in the final step of the preparation contained 20
mM 3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
and 0.03% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside
(DDM); all samples were prepared in this buffer solution. The yield
of wet cells was ∼10 g L–1 from the synthetic 57Fe medium (compared to ∼35 g L–1 from the standard medium). The 57Fe- and 56Fe-containing enzymes displayed the same banding pattern in SDS PAGE,
the same elution volume in gel filtration, and the same specific NADH:hexaammineruthenium(III)
oxidoreductase activity (∼70 μmol NADH min–1 mg protein–1 in 100 μM NADH and 3.5 mM HAR,
pH 7.5, 32 °C).

EPR Spectroscopy
Complex I EPR samples (56Fe and 57Fe, final concentration ∼15 (mg protein)
mL–1) were reduced by 50 mM NADH (Sigma-Aldrich)
in an N2-containing anaerobic glovebox (Belle Technology,
UK) and frozen immediately. No signals were observed unless NADH was
added. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX X-band spectrometer using
an ER4119HS cavity, maintained at low temperature by an ESR900 continuous-flow
liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instruments, UK); the sample temperature
was measured with a calibrated Cernox resistor (Lake Shore Cryotronics
Inc., Westerville, OH). Spin quantitation of N2 was carried out by
double integration of the N2 signal recorded at 15 K, by comparison
to a 1 mM Cu(II) standard.

Mössbauer Spectroscopy
The oxidized Mössbauer
sample contained ∼16 (mg protein) mL–1 of 57Fe complex I (∼0.46 mM 57Fe) and was frozen
“as prepared”. Reduced complex I Mössbauer samples
(final concentration ∼24 (mg protein) mL–1, ∼0.73 mM 57Fe) were prepared by adding 50 mM
NADH to the enzyme in the anaerobic glovebox, and frozen immediately.
Mössbauer spectra were recorded on a spectrometer with alternating
constant acceleration. The minimum experimental line width was 0.24
mm/s (full width at half-height). The sample temperature was maintained
constant in either an Oxford Instruments Variox or an Oxford Instruments
Mössbauer-Spectromag cryostat with split-pair magnet system;
the latter was used for measurements with applied fields up to 7 T,
with the field at the sample orientated perpendicular to the γ-beam.
The γ-source (57Co/Rh, 1.8 GBq) was kept at room
temperature. By using a re-entrant bore tube, the source was positioned
inside the gap of the magnet coils at a position with zero field.
Isomer shifts are quoted relative to iron metal at 300 K. Zero-field
spectra were fitted using quadrupole doublets, and applied field measurements
were simulated with a spin Hamiltonian program based on the usual
nuclear Hamiltonian. In both cases the
line shapes were Voigt profiles, calculated using the complex error
function with the rational approximation of Hui et al., The Lorentzian contributions were fixed to the natural line width
of 57Fe spectra (0.2 mm/s).

Results
EPR Spectroscopy of 57Fe-Containing Complex I
Figure  compares X-band EPR spectra from
NADH-reduced samples of Y. lipolytica complex I containing
either 56Fe or 57Fe. The two sets of spectra
are very similar and typical of spectra from mitochondrial complex
I. By comparison with the extensively characterized spectra of bovine
complex I, the N1b, N2, N3, N4, and N5 signals are readily identified (the most clearly apparent features from each
signal are indicated in Figure ). The spectral
features of the 57Fe-containing complex I are broadened,
relative to those from the 56Fe-containing enzyme. The
broadening is particularly evident for signal N1b (resolved most clearly
at 12 and 25 K), and close inspection reveals that the N1b gz signal is split into an apparent
triplet, with relative intensities of ∼1:2:1. The splitting
can be attributed to hyperfine interactions with two I = 1/2 57Fe nuclei (56Fe has I = 0), and it is fully consistent with the assignment of signal N1b
to a [2Fe–2S]1+ cluster with localized valences.
In this case, the cluster ground state with S = 1/2
results from strong antiferromagnetic coupling between an FeIII center with spin S1 = 5/2 and an FeII center with S2 = 4/2, and the local hyperfine coupling tensors (referring
to S1 and S2) may be denoted A1(FeIII) and A2(FeII). Spin projection considerations then yield effective hyperfine coupling tensors
(referring to the total spin, S) of a1 = 7/3A1(FeIII) and a2 = −4/3A2(FeII). Based on this model, the
resolved hyperfine splitting of gz(N1b) could be readily simulated with the coupling constants a1,z(FeIII) = −43
MHz and a2,z(FeII) = +35 MHz, determined from applied-field Mössbauer measurements
on the [2Fe–2S]1+ clusters of putidaredoxin and the Rieske protein. As indicated by the stick spectrum included in Figure , the hyperfine pattern is actually a quartet (not a triplet)
because a1,z(FeIII) and a2,z(FeII) do not coincide. Incidentally, the intensity ratio of the apparent
line pattern is consistent with a high level of isotopic labeling
with 57Fe, because there are no obvious contributions from
nonlabeled (single line) or singly labeled (double lines) species.
The broadening of the other signals in Figure , which are from reduced [4Fe–4S] clusters, results from unresolved
hyperfine interactions with the 57Fe nuclei (reduced [4Fe–4S]
clusters exhibit both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling
to also achieve S = 1/2 spin states). Finally, similar
EPR spectra have been reported previously for the FeS clusters in
complex I in submitochondrial particles from the fungus Candida
utilis, grown in the presence of 57Fe. Signal N1b was resolved into a triplet, and
its gz signal was characterized
by an apparent hyperfine splitting of ∼1.2 mT (the value determined
here is ∼1.5 mT). In C. utilis, the signals
from the [2Fe–2S] cluster in succinate dehydrogenase and the
Rieske cluster in the cytochrome bc1 complex
were split similarly by hyperfine interactions, reiterating that the
behavior of signal N1b is not unusual in this respect.

I from Y. lipolytica containing 56Fe and 57Fe. Complex I was reduced by 50 mM NADH
under anaerobic conditions. Indicative features from the N1b, N2,
N3, N4, and N5 signals are marked. The top trace shows a simulation
for the resolved hyperfine splitting from 57Fe (I = 1/2) of N1b gz (see text), and the stick diagram denotes the splitting from
the ferric (15.2 G) and ferrous (11.4 G) subsites. Conditions: microwave
frequency ∼9.38 GHz, modulation amplitude 10 G, conversion
time 81.92 ms, time constant 20.48 ms.

Mössbauer Spectra from Oxidized 57Fe-Containing
Complex I
Figure  shows the zero-field
Mössbauer spectra of oxidized 57Fe-containing complex
I, recorded at 80 K. The oxidized enzyme does not exhibit any EPR
signals, so each molecule should contain two [2Fe–2S] and six
[4Fe–4S] oxidized clusters. Accordingly, Figure shows a relatively simple quadrupole
pattern without paramagnetic splitting, which is fit by summing two
doublet subspectra to reproduce the slight asymmetry that is apparent
in the peak intensities (see Table ). Subspectrum
1 (green) has a low isomer shift (δ = 0.25 mm/s) that is typical
of the ferric FeS4 subsites of oxidized [2Fe–2S]
clusters,− and a quadrupole splitting
(ΔEQ = 0.51 mm/s) that is consistent
with the expected range for oxidized cysteine-ligated [2Fe–2S]
clusters (0.52–0.85 mm/s),, clearly lower
than the value expected for the FeS2N2 subsite
of an oxidized Rieske protein (0.91 mm/s). The intensity of subspectrum 1 has been constrained to represent
14.3% of the total intensity (4 out of 28 Fe atoms); allowing the
relative intensities of subspectra 1 and 2 to vary freely did not
improve the fit significantly. Subspectrum 2 (blue) has an isomer
shift (δ = 0.43 mm/s) and quadrupole splitting (ΔEQ = 0.93 mm/s) that are consistent with the
known spectra of oxidized [4Fe–4S] clusters,, and it represents 85.7% of the total intensity (24 out of 28 Fe
atoms). Thus, the Mössbauer spectrum in Figure  is entirely consistent with the expected cluster ensemble
of complex I. Subspectrum 2 can be fit with a single doublet because
the subsites in oxidized [4Fe–4S] clusters are all equivalent
(Fe2.5+) due to valence delocalization., The lines are very broad because the large number of iron sites
that contribute to them are not perfectly equivalent (ΓL = 0.44 mm/s in a preliminary fit using Lorentzian line shapes).
Therefore, to describe the broadening effect, we used Voigt line shapes,
which comprise Gaussian distributions of Lorentzian line shapes, throughout
this work. Note also that one of the
[4Fe–4S] clusters in complex I has an unusual 3Cys1His ligation.
Previously, a similar [4Fe–4S]2+ cluster in 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydratase was shown to exhibit an entirely
symmetrical Mössbauer spectrum, matching the spectra of canonical
4Cys-ligated clusters. Therefore, although
the resolution of our spectra is not sufficient to rule out a unique
subspectrum from this single Fe subsite, we do not consider the 3Cys1His
cluster separately. Finally, the applied-field measurement shown in
Figure  could be reasonably well simulated
using S = 0 and the two subspectra from Figure , revealing no evidence for an appreciable amount
of any paramagnetic cluster.

Mössbauer Spectra from NADH-Reduced 57Fe-Containing
Complex I
First, we consider the two [2Fe–2S] clusters.
Signal N1b is clearly observed in EPR spectra from NADH-reduced Y. lipolytica complex I (see Figure ), and as described above, it is from cluster 2Fe[75] (see Figure ). There are no additional signals from reduced
2Fe clusters in the spectra shown in Figure ; in particular, signal N1a (described above), which would be exhibited
by cluster 2Fe[24] if it was reduced, is absent. Furthermore, in NADH-reduced B. taurus complex I, which has been characterized extensively
by EPR, signal N1b is substoichiometric; it increases in intensity
more than 3-fold when the enzyme is reduced to −1 V and has a low signal amplitude both in continuous-wave
X-band and echo-detected spectra., On the basis
of these results, we estimate that cluster 2Fe[75] is 1/3 reduced
by NADH in B. taurus complex I, and because of the
high similarity of the B. taurus and Y. lipolytica enzymes and their EPR spectra, we expect signal N1b to be similarly
substoichiometric in NADH-reduced Y. lipolytica complex
I. Consequently, we expect the two [2Fe–2S]
clusters in the NADH-reduced sample to contribute ∼0.3 reduced
and ∼1.7 oxidized clusters.

Second, as described above,
four signals from reduced [4Fe–4S] clusters are observed in
Figure : signals N2, N3, N4, and N5. Signal
N2 (from cluster 4Fe[PS], see Figure ) exhibits
a relatively high reduction potential, and so cluster 4Fe[PS] is very
likely fully reduced; signals N3, N4, and N5 (from clusters 4Fe[51],
4Fe[TY]1, and 4Fe[75]C, respectively) have all been reported to exhibit
reduction potentials of approximately −0.25 V.,− However, the stoichiometry of the NADH-reduced clusters has not
been established unambiguously. Signals
N3 and N4 increased relative to N2 in B. taurus complex
I reduced to −1 V (relative to in the enzyme reduced by NADH),
and the relative amplitudes of N2, N3, and N4 in both continuous-wave
X-band and echo-detected spectra suggest that N3, in particular, may
be substoichiometric., Clearly, if the clusters have
potentials of −0.25 V, they should be fully reduced in NADH
(approximately −0.4 V when [NAD+] is very low);
we return to this issue below. Here, we simply anticipate that the
six [4Fe–4S] clusters in the NADH-reduced sample will comprise
up to four reduced clusters and at least two oxidized clusters.

Figure  shows the zero-field Mössbauer
spectrum of NADH-reduced complex I. Like the spectrum of the fully
oxidized enzyme, the spectrum comprises essentially two simple peaks,
although both the peak asymmetry and width are increased. The data
in Figure  were modeled using four major subspectra:
one subspectrum for the “typical” equivalent mixed-valence
subsites in oxidized [4Fe–4S] clusters, two subspectra for
the “typical” mixed-valence subsites in reduced [4Fe–4S]
clusters, and one subspectrum for the valence-localized Fe3+ subsites in oxidized (and reduced) [2Fe–2S] clusters. A fifth,
minor, subspectrum was added to account for the valence-localized
Fe2+ subsites in reduced [2Fe–2S] clusters. The
best fit obtained with the Voigt line shapes (shown in Figure ) is defined by the parameters in Table . The subspectra from the oxidized [2Fe–2S]
and [4Fe–4S] clusters, subspectra 1 (green) and 2 (blue), respectively,
correspond closely to those from the oxidized sample. Subspectrum
1 represents purely ferric species, so it was constrained to account
for 13.1% of the total iron (1.67 [2Fe–2S]2+ clusters,
plus the ferric subsite of 0.33 reduced [2Fe–2S]1+ clusters; see below). A distinct subspectrum for purely Fe2+ species (subspectrum 3, cyan), a unique indicator for reduced [2Fe–2S]1+ clusters with spin S = 1/2, is poorly resolved
from the background. It is included only because the N1b signal is
present in the EPR spectrum. Subspectrum 3 clearly corresponds to
less than one iron out of 28 (1/28 = 3.6%), and it is included in
Figure  at ∼1.2%, based on our estimate
(described above) that only ∼1/3 of the N1b clusters are reduced.
The spectrum from the reduced [4Fe–4S] clusters exhibits slightly
higher isomer shifts and quadrupole splitting than exhibited by the
oxidized clusters,, and we introduced two “phenomenological”
subspectra in the fit, subspectra 4 and 5 (dark and light pink), to
account for distinguishable Fe2.5+Fe2.5+ and
Fe2+Fe2+ pairs, respectively, but without further distinction of individual clusters
(as expected, subspectra 2 and 4 are similar). To fit the data in
Figure , the relative contributions from the
oxidized and reduced [4Fe–4S] clusters were allowed to vary.
In the best fit (Table ) the relative intensities
are 44.5% of the total iron for [4Fe–4S]2+ and 41.2%
for [4Fe–4S]1+: on average, 3.1 oxidized clusters
and 2.9 reduced clusters. The best fit using only Lorentzian line
shapes gave very similar results: 3.0 oxidized and 3.0 reduced clusters.
However, the signal-to-noise level in the data suggests that it is
not appropriate to consider only a single, unique fit. Therefore,
fits to the data using different intensity ratios for subspectra 2
and (4 + 5) were optimized and evaluated. Consequently, we found that
the data are consistent with 3.1 ± 0.5 oxidized [4Fe–4S]
clusters and 2.9 ± 0.5 reduced [4Fe–4S] clusters in the
NADH-reduced sample.

Zero-field Mössbauer spectrum recorded at 160 K
on complex
I from Y. lipolytica reduced by NADH. The data were
fit using five quadrupole doublets with Voigtian line shapes (subspectrum
1, Fe3+ from oxidized and reduced [2Fe–2S], in green;
subspectrum 2, oxidized [4Fe–4S], in blue; subspectrum 3, Fe2+ from reduced [2Fe–2S], in cyan (top); subspectrum
4, Fe2.5+ pair from reduced [4Fe–4S], in dark pink;
subspectrum 5, Fe2+ pair from reduced [4Fe–4S],
in light pink); the sum of the five subspectra is shown in red, and
the parameters are given in Table .

The 0.1 and 7 T low-temperature measurements on
NADH-reduced complex
I shown in Figure  are consistent with the
overall assignment of oxidized and reduced species described above.
The paramagnetic [4Fe–4S]1+ clusters (dark and light
pink traces) show sizable paramagnetic splitting due to the presence
of induced static internal fields at the iron subsites, whereas the
diamagnetic [2Fe–2S]2+ and [4Fe–4S]2+ clusters are virtually unaffected in the weak-field condition (Figure A1, green and blue traces) (the substoichiometric
[2Fe–2S]1+ contribution was not included in the
simulations). With the strong applied field (7 T, Figure A2) the diamagnetic clusters also show magnetic splitting,
due to the nuclear Zeeman effect, although, importantly, their contribution
does not fully overlap those of the paramagnetic reduced clusters
(note the line at ca. +3 mm/s). Subspectrum 5 (light pink) originates
from the Fe2+Fe2+ sites of the [4Fe–4S]1+ clusters, which are coupled antiparallel to their respective
cluster spins to give positive effective a values
and large magnetic splitting. The fact that the distinct feature of
subspectrum 5 at ca. +3 mm/s does not increase its relative intensity
under high field conditions (along with the high-quality overall fit
to the high-field spectrum) rules out spin-coupling between reduced
paramagnetic clusters as an alternative explanation for the diamagnetic
behavior of some of the iron–sulfur clusters in NADH-reduced
complex I. (There are no direct bonds (mono- or diatomic bridges)
between the clusters, so long-range exchange coupling that is strong
enough to “survive” the strong 7 T field can be excluded
unambiguously.) Thus, the spectra in Figure  confirm that the diamagnetic clusters in NADH-reduced complex I
are oxidized. The relative intensities of the diamagnetic and paramagnetic
subspectra in Figure  suggest that 42% of
the iron is in oxidized [4Fe–4S]2+ clusters and
46% in reduced [4Fe–4S]1+ clusters, in reasonable
agreement with the ratio determined from the zero-field data (see
Table ).

tensors adapted from the magnetic Mössbauer spectrum of a bacterial
ferredoxin: a/gNβN = (−22, −23.4, −19.4) T for Fe2.5+Fe2.5+ and a/gNβN = (+17.2, +7.6, +8.7) T for Fe2+Fe2+., The simulations are not intended to be unique,
but to present a picture to support the quantification of the contributions
from the diamagnetic and paramagnetic subspectra. The substoichiometric
contribution from the Fe2+ subsite of [2Fe–2S]1+ clusters was neglected, and the relative intensities of
the other contributions were taken from the fit to the zero-field
data. (B) The residual spectrum from (A1) after subtraction of the
diamagnetic subspectra (the green and blue traces); the dark and light
pink traces are the simulations of the paramagnetic contributions
presented in (A1).

In summary, our Mössbauer data are consistent
with 5/3 oxidized
[2Fe–2S], 1/3 reduced [2Fe–2S], ∼3 oxidized [4Fe–4S],
and ∼3 reduced [4Fe–4S] clusters in NADH-reduced complex
I. Thus, approximately half of the clusters remain oxidized when complex
I is reduced by NADH: the clusters which are not observed in the EPR
spectrum simply remain oxidized. Our conclusion is consistent with
previous magnetic circular dichroism data, which did not reveal any
evidence for EPR-silent paramagnetic centers in B. taurus complex I. In conjunction with the
EPR analyses described above, our data suggest that, in the NADH-reduced
enzyme, cluster 2Fe[24] is fully oxidized and cluster 2Fe[75] is partially
reduced, cluster 4Fe[PS] (N2) is fully reduced and clusters 4Fe[75]H
and 4Fe[TY]2 are fully oxidized, and clusters 4Fe[51], 4Fe[75]C, and
4Fe[TY]1 are (on average) 2/3 reduced each.

Discussion
Reduction of the FeS Clusters in Mitochondrial Complex I by
NADH
The Mössbauer analyses presented here demonstrate
clearly that only a subset of the clusters in mitochondrial complex
I are reduced in the presence of NADH: the three clusters that are
not represented in EPR spectra of NADH-reduced mitochondrial complex
I are oxidized. Together, the EPR and Mössbauer results suggest
that the FeS clusters in mitochondrial complex I can be classified
as “high” or “low” potential clusters:
the high potential clusters are mostly (or entirely) reduced in NADH
(4Fe[51], 4Fe[75]C, 4Fe[TY]1, and 4Fe[PS], see Figure ), and the low potential clusters are mostly (or entirely)
oxidized (2Fe[24], 2Fe[75], 4Fe[75]H, and 4Fe[TY]2). The high and
low potential clusters alternate along the cluster chain from the
flavin to the ubiquinone-binding site (see Figure ).

Three possible reduction potential profiles for electron transfer
through the FeS clusters in complex I. In each case the potentials
of 4Fe[51], 4Fe[75]C, and 4Fe[TY]1 are −0.250 V, and the potential
of 4Fe[PS] is −0.15 V. The potentials of 2Fe[75], 4Fe[75]H,
and 4Fe[TY]2 are estimated according to different values of the protein
dielectric (see text). For ε → ∞ (black) the potentials
are −0.42 V for 2Fe[75] (1/3 reduced at −0.4 V) and
−0.48 V for 4Fe[75]H and 4Fe[TY]2 (5% reduced at −0.4
V); for ε = 20 (blue) and ε = 4 (red) the potentials are
shifted according to the electrostatic interactions calculated by
Couch and co-workers (for ε = 20,
−0.37 V for 2Fe[75], −0.43 V for 4Fe[75]H, and −0.42
V for 4Fe[TY]2; for ε = 4, −0.24 V for 2Fe[75], −0.30
V for 4Fe[75]H, and −0.25 V for 4Fe[TY]2). In gray: the two
flavin potentials are −0.39 and −0.29 V, the two ubiquinone
potentials are 0 and −0.12 V (for a complex I-bound ubiquinone);
2Fe[24] (−0.38 V) has been omitted as it does not lie between
the flavin and the quinone (values taken from ref ()).

The potential of 4Fe[PS] (N2) is higher than the
potentials of
the other clusters (see above), so it is very probably fully reduced
in NADH, accounting for one of the ∼3 reduced clusters. If
the 4Fe[51] (N3), 4Fe[75]C (N5), and 4Fe[TY]1 (N4) clusters were fully
reduced also, then there would be four reduced 4Fe clusters present
in NADH-reduced complex I—but the Mössbauer data presented
here are not consistent with four reduced 4Fe clusters. The substoichiometric
reduction of 4Fe[51] (N3), 4Fe[75]C (N5), and 4Fe[TY]1 (N4) by NADH
is supported by the relatively low signal amplitudes of N3 and N4
and their increased intensity when the enzyme is reduced to −1
V;, the behavior of N5 is more complicated because its
temperature dependence varies with the level of enzyme reduction. Conversely, as described above, redox titrations
provided potentials of around −0.25 V for all these three clusters,
so they should, in principle, all be fully reduced in NADH (approximately
−0.4 V). We propose the following explanation for the discrepancy.
The redox-titration data (signal amplitude vs set potential) were
fit using the Nernst equation or evaluated qualitatively for the midpoint
potential of the titration, but only limited low potential data were
available or included in the fitting, and the stoichiometries of the
reduced clusters were not measured (only assumed).,, Thus, it is likely that clusters 4Fe[51],
4Fe[75]C, and 4Fe[TY]1 do not display perfect Nernstian behavior,
especially at low potential—their EPR signal intensities vary
over a wider range of potential than expected, most likely because
of interactions between the reduced clusters. Non-Nernstian behavior
for some of the FeS clusters in complex I from E. coli has been described previously. However,
at relatively high potentials (where the probability of multiple reduced
clusters in the same molecule is low) the reduction potentials provide
a reasonable picture of the thermodynamics of cluster reduction. For
this reason we have used the “consensus” reduction potentials
of −0.25 V for 4Fe[51], 4Fe[75]C, and 4Fe[TY]1 in the kinetic
simulations described below. Finally, we note that we cannot absolutely
exclude the possibility that a small subset of the complex I molecules
present are unable to react with NADH (and so remain fully oxidized). However, the flavin is present stoichiometrically
(flavin:protein ratio ∼ 1:1); spin quantitation of signal N2,
using a Cu(II) standard, gave results which were consistent with the
stoichiometric reduction of the 4Fe[PS] (N2) cluster (N2:protein ratio
∼1:1); and EPR samples prepared in high DDM concentrations
did not display decreased signal intensities.

Much less is known
about the low potential clusters in mitochondrial
complex I. Our Mössbauer data support the proposal (described
above) that cluster 2Fe[75] (N1b) is only partly reduced in NADH-reduced
mitochondrial complex I. If 2Fe[75] (N1b) is 1/3 reduced in NADH (at
−0.4 V), then its apparent reduction potential is −0.42
V. Furthermore, our Mössbauer data confirm that cluster 2Fe[24]
(N1a) is not reduced by NADH in mitochondrial complex I. The reason
why 2Fe[24] remains oxidized in the intact enzyme but can be reduced
readily in overexpressed subunits and in the flavoprotein subcomplex
(described above) remains unclear. It is possible that the reduction
of 2Fe[24] is limited kinetically. Finally, there is no evidence,
from either EPR or Mössbauer analyses, for the reduction of
clusters 4Fe[75]H and 4Fe[TY]2 in any NADH-reduced complex I, although
additional spectral features (suggestive of interactions between adjacent
reduced clusters) were observed in B. taurus complex
I at −1 V. As an estimate, if 4Fe[75]H
and 4Fe[TY]2 are 5% reduced in NADH (at −0.4 V), then their
apparent reduction potentials are −0.48 V.

Effect of the Ensemble on Cluster Reduction
The reduction
potential profile for the seven FeS clusters between the flavin and
the ubiquinone binding site in complex I, constructed using the potentials
described above, is shown in black in Figure . The profile reveals an apparent pattern of alternating higher and
lower potential clusters. However, it is clear that electrostatic
interactions between adjacent clusters may influence their apparent
reduction potentials in redox titrations, and attempts have been made
to use calculations, based on the structure of the hydrophilic arm
of T. thermophilus complex I, to deconvolute the
intrinsic cluster potentials from redox titration data.,, For example, the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann
equation was used to calculate the expected shift in apparent reduction
potential of each cluster upon the reduction of each of the other
clusters, to define a set of pairwise interactions. However, the calculated values depend heavily upon the
modeling procedure and the value chosen for the protein dielectric
(ε), which is poorly represented by a single macroscopic parameter. With ε = 20, individual reduction potentials
were calculated to shift by up to 60 mV upon reduction of both adjacent
clusters.

The profile shown in
blue in Figure  shows the “dampening”
effect of removing the ε = 20 electrostatic interactions between
adjacent clusters from the potential profile deduced above: the interactions
exaggerate existing, intrinsic potential differences by shifting the
lower potential clusters yet lower. With ε = 4 the electrostatic
interactions are much larger, and individual
potentials are calculated to shift by up to 0.23 V when both adjacent
clusters are reduced. Consequently, the
reduction potential profile is flattened significantly when the ε
= 4 interactions are subtracted (shown in red in Figure ), and provided that the terminal 4Fe[PS] cluster acts as
a high potential “anchor”, the interactions alone are
sufficient to produce an alternating profile (like the black profile
shown in Figure ) from a set of intrinsically
isopotential clusters. Currently, we do not know which of the three
profiles in Figure  best represents the free
energy profile for transfer of a single electron through complex I.
We note only that EPR spectra from subcomplex Iλ, the hydophilic
domain of complex I produced by fragmentation of the enzyme close
to the 4Fe[PS] cluster, are identical
to those from intact complex I, except that N2 is decreased or missing (no additional signals are present). Similarly,
no additional EPR signals were observed when several residues around
cluster 4Fe[PS] in Y. lipolytica complex I were mutated,
resulting in the loss of signal N2. As
the high-potential 4Fe[PS] “anchor” cluster is missing
in both cases, these observations argue against electrostatic interactions
as the only reason why the 2Fe[75], 4Fe[75]H, and 4Fe[TY]2 clusters
have such low apparent reduction potentials. Thus, it is most likely
that electrostatic interactions only exaggerate intrinsic potential
differences between the clusters, favoring the ε = 20 (blue)
profile as the most representative possibility included in Figure . Finally, alternating profiles are exhibited by
redox titrations of a number of enzymes, including succinate dehydrogenase
and fumarate reductase, NiFe hydrogenase, and the photosynthetic reaction center., In particular, the electrostatic interactions between the hemes
in the reaction center have been characterized and their effects on
the potential profile and rates of electron transfer described.,

Rates of Electron Transfer along the Cluster Chain
Dutton and co-workers have described a simple approach to predicting
the rates of intramolecular electron transfer in proteins.,, Thus, we used Dutton’s
model for electron transfer in complex I to predict the time required for two electrons to transfer from
the flavin to a bound quinone along the chain of FeS clusters. We
used the same parameters as described previously, except that we altered the reduction potentials of the
seven clusters in the chain, to evaluate the three potential energy
profiles of Figure . With the flattest reduction
potential profile (ε = 4, red profile in Figure ) it takes 0.42 ms for ubiquinol to be formed in 50% of the
population of complex I molecules considered (the half-transfer time
is 0.42 ms). The time required is slightly longer than the time required
by the profile used by Dutton and co-workers because of the 0.05 V more-negative potential of cluster 4Fe[75]H
and because the potential of 4Fe[PS] (N2) was set to −0.15
V, instead of −0.1 V (with −0.1 V a significant fraction
of the population remains in the (semiquinone + reduced N2) state,
rather than going on to form ubiquinol); raising the potential of 4Fe[75]H from −0.3 to −0.25
V provides a half-transfer time of 0.16 ms. With the intermediate
profile (ε = 20, blue in Figure ) the
calculated half-transfer time is 7.9 ms, and with the most strongly
alternating profile (ε → ∞, black in Figure ) it is 36 ms.

There have been few attempts
to determine the rate of electron transfer along the chain of clusters
in complex I experimentally. Most notably, a fast freeze–quench
procedure has been used to attempt to monitor electron transfer in E. coli complex I. However,
as revealed by the seminal experiments of DeVault and Chance, freezing a sample in liquid nitrogen cannot
be relied on to prevent electron transfer between the clusters, and
in fact, in the complex I experiments, the electrons are always observed
on the highest potential clusters available to them, with the rate
at which pairs of electrons enter the chain being limited first by
NADH binding/hydride transfer and then by NAD+ dissociation.
Alternatively, complex I turnover (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreduction)
is a well-defined reaction that occurs at up to ∼200 s–1 (∼400 electrons transferred down the chain
per second) in isolated complex I., Consequently,
the maximum possible half-transfer time is 1.7 ms (if, which is highly
unlikely, intramolecular electron transfer is fully rate limiting).

Comparison of the experimentally determined limit of 1.7 ms with
the half-transfer times calculated using Dutton’s model suggests
that neither the ε → ∞ nor the ε = 20 profiles
shown in Figure  are able to support fast
enough electron transfer. Only the ε = 4 profile leads to a
rate of electron transfer that is fast enough to support the observed
rate of catalysis, but the relevance of this profile has been questioned
above. Alternative explanations for the mismatch in rates are that
the electron transfer model applied here is too simple to describe the system adequately, or that the standard
parameters used in the model are not appropriate for complex I (for
example, the reorganization energy used, 0.7 eV, may be too high for an FeS cluster). Recently, there have been two attempts to define the rates of
individual transfer steps in complex I using “atomistic”
approaches., These approaches highlight the
importance of specific residues, particularly aromatic residues, in
the intercluster regions, but the rates calculated for individual
transfer steps are, in fact, lower than those predicted by Dutton’s
empirical approach.

The Mössbauer data presented here
define the pattern of
oxidized and reduced clusters in NADH-reduced mitochondrial complex
I, and set limits on the apparent reduction potentials of the clusters
in redox titrations. The results highlight the need to consider how
the apparent potentials reflect both the intrinsic cluster potentials
and the electrostatic interactions between clusters; both factors
need to be better understood before models to calculate rates of electron
transfer can be further implemented and evaluated. Thus, a complete
understanding of how electrons transfer along extended cofactor chains
in redox enzymes will require an integrated thermodynamic and kinetic
approach that focuses on the cofactors as an ensemble rather than
as a collection of individual sites.
