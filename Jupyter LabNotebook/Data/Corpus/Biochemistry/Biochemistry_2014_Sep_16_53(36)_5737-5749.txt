Transforming growth factor beta isoforms, TGF-β1,
-β2,
and -β3, are small (25 kDa) secreted homodimeric signaling proteins.
They coordinate wound healing, modulate immune cell function, maintain
the extracellular matrix, and regulate epithelial and endothelial
cell growth and differentiation. Their
importance is demonstrated by the many human diseases that result
from disruption or dysregulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway,
including developmental disorders, such as Marfan’s disease, and adult diseases such as cancer and fibrosis.

TGF-β
isoforms signal through two surface receptors, known
as the TGF-β type I and type II receptors (TβRI and TβRII,
respectively). TGF-βs assemble TβRI and TβRII into
a TβRI2-TβRII2 heterotetramer in
a sequential manner, first by binding TβRII followed by recruitment
of TβRI. The stepwise assembly of
TβRI and TβRII into a TβRI2-TβRII2 heterotetramer is driven by binding of TβRI to a composite
TGF-β/TβRII interface., The assembly
of the TβRI2-TβRII2 heterotetramer
triggers a transphosphorylation cascade whereby the constitutively
active TβRII kinase phosphorylates TβRI in a negative
regulatory domain known as a GS box. This activates the TβRI
kinase, which phosphorylates cytoplasmic effectors, including the canonical nuclear-translocating Smad proteins, but others as well. The TGF-β type III receptor (TβRIII), a cell surface
proteoglycan with a short
noncatalytic cytoplasmic domain, binds all three TGF-β isoforms
and promotes the formation of the signaling complex with TβRI
and TβRII. The ability of TβRIII
to potentiate assembly of the signaling complex is especially important
for TGF-β2 since TGF-β2 binds TβRII weakly, and
most cells are poorly responsive to TGF-β2 in the absence of
TβRIII.

The TGF-β isoforms
are encoded by distinct genes and are
highly conserved relative to one another and across species, with
the human TGF-β isoforms sharing between 71–79% identity
(, Figure S1A). The
three-dimensional structures of the TGF-βs are similar, consisting
of two cystine-knotted monomers tethered together by a disulfide bond.− The monomers are described as adopting the shape of an extended
hand, and the homodimer is formed by packing the palm of one hand
into the heel of the other (, Figure S1B).

TGF-β isoforms are indistinguishable in
most cell-based reporter
gene and growth inhibition assays. The
primary exception is TGF-β2, which is 100–1000-fold less
potent than TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 in cell lines that lack
TβRIII.,, The TGF-β isoforms are nonetheless each required in vivo as
the isoform-specific null mice are inviable: TGF-β1 null mice
have an autoimmune-like inflammatory disease and die within a few
days of weaning,, TGF-β2 null mice exhibit
developmental defects of the heart, spinal column, urogenital tract,
eye, and inner ear and die just before birth, and TGF-β3 null mice are defective in lung development, have
cleft palate, and die about a day after birth. The phenotypic differences in the null mice correlate with
differences in tissue expression patterns. TGF-β1, for example,
is widely expressed in both developing embryos and adults, consistent
with the widespread multifocal inflammatory disease characteristic
of the TGF-β1 null mice, while TGF-β2 and TGF-β3
are abundantly expressed in the developing heart and lungs, consistent
with major developmental defects of these organs in the corresponding
null mice.

Though the three-dimensional structures of the isoforms
are similar,
intrinsic differences among them might also contribute to the requirement
of each in vivo. This was first suggested when it was shown that TGF-β1
and TGF-β3 have opposing effects in skin wound healing, with
topical application of purified TGF-β3 preventing and TGF-β1
promoting scarring. The mechanism in
wound healing has recently been shown to be due to differences in
chemoregulated cell migration, with TGF-β3
promoting epidermal cell migration, and TGF-β1 neither promoting
nor inhibiting migration. The differences
between isoforms have been further suggested by tissue explant studies
in which cleft palates, excised from developing TGF-β3 null
embryos, developed normally when exogenous purified TGF-β3 was
added to the culture medium, but not when TGF-β1 or TGF-β2
was added− and by gene replacement studies where “knock-in”
of the coding sequence for the mature domain of TGF-β1 into
the TGF-β3 locus, and vice versa, led to partial, but not complete,
rescue of the mutant phenotype., These results indicate
that there are indeed intrinsic differences between isoforms that
contribute to their distinct functions in vivo.

The solution
structure of TGF-β1 and the crystal
structure of TGF-β3 are similar:
the palm α-helix, α3, packs into the heel
of the other monomer to form a compact “closed” dimer
(, Figure S1B). TGF-β1
and TGF-β3 nevertheless appear to differ in solution, as NMR
secondary shifts and {1H}-15N heteronuclear
NOEs indicate that α3 is well-ordered and rigid in TGF-β1, but not in TGF-β3, (, Figure S2).
The disorder in the region corresponding to α3 in TGF-β3
is also suggested by the crystal structure of the TβRII/TGF-β3
complex, where the two subunits are rotated away from one another
by 101° in a noncanonical “open” conformation and
there is no electron density for α3 (Figure A). Though it is conceivable
that the open form of TGF-β3 might be a consequence of either
differences in the solution conditions under which the NMR studies
were performed (TGF-β1 in 5% D2O at pH 4.2 and TGF-β3
in 6% dioxane-d8, 2% methanol-d3, 87% H2O, and 5% D2O
at pH 2.9) or the low pH at which the TGF-β3/TβRII complex
was crystallized (pH 4.5), this is unlikely as TGF-β3 alone
was recently crystallized in the open form at neutral pH. The α-helix 3 region cannot be structurally
ordered in the open conformation since it would sterically overlap
with residues in the heel of the other monomer (Figure A). The overall conclusion based on a synthesis of these observations
is that in solution TGF-β3 undergoes a conformational equilibrium
between the “closed” and “open” states,
with the open state predominating (KCO ≫ 1; Figure A). TGF-β1 may
also undergo a similar equilibrium, but with the closed state predominating
(KCO ≪ 1).

Closed and open forms
of TGF-β3 and construct design for
this study. (A) Closed and open conformations of TGF-β3. Closed
form is from the crystal structure of unbound TGF-β3 (PDB code 1TGJ), while the open
form is from the crystal structure of the TGF-β3/TβRII
complex (PDB code 1KTZ; TβRII not displayed). Open form differs from the closed by
a 101° degree rotation of the monomers away from one another;
the open form also has no electron density for the α-helix 3
and connecting loops (residues 55–72, dashed line). Disorder
of α-helix 3 in the open form is likely caused by steric overlap
between residues near the C-terminal end of α-helix 3 and the
heel of the opposing monomer; this is shown by the structure below
the “closed” form in which TGF-β3 monomers from
the closed form (with an intact α-helix 3) have been overlaid
onto the partial monomer structures of the open form. Steric clashes
between α3 and the heel of one monomer and the other are highlighted
in green. (B) Amino acid sequence alignment of TGF-β1 and -β3
and the sequences of TGF-β131, TGF-β313 and TGF-β3H4.
Secondary structural elements correspond to those from the crystal
structure of TGF-β3 (PDB code 1TGJ). Residues from TGF-β1 are highlighted
with a gray background, while those from TGF-β3 with a blue
background; the same color scheme is used for TGF-β131, TGF-β313,
and TGF-β3H4. (C, D) Interaction of α-helix 3 of one monomer
with the heel of the other for the closed form of TGF-β1 and
-β3 (PDB codes 1KLC and 1TGJ,
respectively). Heel residues conserved between TGF-β1 and -β3
(L28, I22, M104, V106, and A41) are highlighted in light and dark
pink. Helical residues that differ between TGF-β1 and -β3
are highlighted in red.

The difference in KCO between
TGF-β1
and TGF-β3 might be due to differences in packing interactions
in the dimer interface, with more favorable interactions favoring
the closed form. The differences in KCO might alternatively be due to differences in the intrinsic stability
of α-helix 3, with a more stable helix more strongly resisting
the transition from the closed to open form (thus favoring the closed
form). The objective of this study was to investigate the underlying
basis for the differences in KCO between
TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 and whether this might underlie their
differences in biological activity.

Experimental Procedures
Plasmid
Constructs
The coding sequences for the mature
TGF-β3, TGF-β131, and TGF-β313 signaling ligands
(each 336 nucleotides in length) were synthesized (Genscript). The
synthetic genes were inserted between the NdeI and HindIII sites downstream of the T7 promoter in plasmid pET32a (Novagen).
The TGF-β3 A54L, H58Y, G63A, and T67Q mutant, termed TGF-β3H4,
was constructed by performing site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange
Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) of the T7-based TGF-β3
construct described above. The coding sequence for the mature domain
of TGF-β131 was also used to replace the corresponding sequence
for the mature domain of TGF-β1 in the CHO cell expression vector
pcDNA-GS-TGF-β1 (kindly provided by Dr. Peter Sun, NIAID, Rockville,
MD). The coding sequence for TGF-β131
in this expression vector (designated pcDNA-GS-TGF-β131) is
preceded by the rat serum albumin leader peptide and the TGF-β1
pro-domain, both of which are required for the proper maturation and
secretion of the mature dimer into the culture medium.

Protein Preparation
TGF-β3, TGF-β313, and
TGF-β3H4 were expressed in bacteria, refolded, and purified
using the procedure previously described for TGF-β3. TβRII-ED (residues 15–130) and
TβRI-ED (residues 7–91) were expressed in bacteria, refolded,
and purified as previously described., TGF-β1
and TGF-β131 were expressed and purified from conditioned medium
produced by an overexpressing stably transfected CHO cell line. The
cell line used to produce TGF-β1 has been previously described and was kindly provided from Dr. Peter Sun (NIAID,
Rockville, MD). The TGF-β131 cell line was generated by transfecting
the pcDNA-GS-TGF-β131 construct into CHO-lec3.2.8.1 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the same protocol for TGF-β1. The highest expressing stable transfected clone
was selected by ELISA and chosen for large-scale protein production
as described. TGF-β1 and TGF-β131
were purified as described, but with
the modification that ion-exchange chromatography was used in the
last step of the purification in place of size exclusion chromatography.
The ion-exchange chromatography was performed by dialyzing the TGF-β1
or TGF-β131 preparation into 0.1 M acetic acid and loading onto
a Source 15S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated
in ligand buffer (20 mM sodium acetate, 30% isopropanol, pH 4.0).
The column was then washed with three column volumes of ligand buffer
and eluted with 200–600 mM linear NaCl gradient in ligand buffer
over 10 column volumes. The corresponding dimer peak was pooled and
dialyzed against 4 L of 100 mM acetic acid (4 h/cycle, 3 cycles).

NMR Sample Preparation
Uniformly isotopically labeled
TGF-β313 and TGF-β3H4 used in the NMR studies were obtained
by growing transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)
cells (EMD Biosciences) on M9 minimal medium enriched with 0.1% (w/v) 15NHCl4 or 0.1% (w/v) 15NHCl4 and 0.3% (w/v) uniformly 13C-labeled d-glucose
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) following the procedure described
by Marley. Selectively isotopically labeled
forms of TGF-β131 were obtained by culturing CHO-lec3.2.8.1
cells stably transfected with the pcDNA-GS-TGF-β131 construct
in SFM4CHO serum free medium (Hyclone) custom formulated so that it
lacked leucine, tyrosine, glycine, valine, and cysteine. The labeled
amino acids (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) were added to the medium
according to the concentrations in its original formulation. Four
different selective labeling schemes, each with one 15N-labeled
amino acid and one 13CO labeled amino acid,
were used as shown in Table . NMR samples
of TGF-β313, TGF-β131, and TGF-β3H4 were prepared
by buffer exchanging the purified protein into 87% H2O,
5% D2O, 6% dioxane-d8 and 2%
methanol-d3 at pH 2.9. The buffer exchanged
protein samples, which had a concentration of 0.25–0.5 mM and
a volume of 325 μL, were transferred to clean Shigemi thinwall
microcells (Shigemi).

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR data were collected
at 40 °C
using a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm 1H{13C,15N} z-gradient “TCI”
cryogenically cooled probe (Bruker Biospin). Backbone resonances of
TGF-β313 and TGF-β3H4 were assigned by recording and analyzing
HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HCACO, and HBHACONH triple resonance
data sets. NMR data were processed and analyzed using the nmrPipe and Sparky software
packages, respectively. Backbone amide 15N T1, 15N T2, and
{1H}-15N NOE relaxation parameters were measured
in an interleaved manner at 40 °C at a 15N frequency
of 70.95 MHz using 1H-detected pulse schemes previously
described. The T1 and T2 data sets were each collected
using 8–10 delay times, varying between 16–3200 ms and
16–192 ms, respectively. The T1 and T2 relaxation times were obtained
by fitting relative peak intensities as a function of T1 or T2 delay time to a two-parameter
decaying exponential. NOE values were obtained by taking the ratio
of peak intensities from experiments performed with and without 1H presaturation and by applying a correction factor to account
for the incomplete recovery of both 15N and 1H magnetization.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
CD measurements were
performed at 25 °C in the far UV (200–250 nm) on a JASCO
J-815 spectropolarimeter using quartz cells with a path length of
1 mm. CD spectra were measured with 0.25 mg mL–1 TGF-β samples in 10 mM H3PO4 (pH 2.9)
and were processed by subtracting the buffer contribution. Experimental
data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity (degree × cm2/dmol).

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Binding Assays
SPR
binding studies were performed with a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE
Healthcare) and were analyzed using the software package Scrubber2
(Biologic Software). TGF-βs were biotinylated and captured on
carboxymethyl dextran (CM5) chips. This was accomplished by adding
a 1.25-fold excess of the purified TβRI and TβRII ectodomains
in 0.1 M NaHCO3 at pH 7.5 to TGF-β1, TGF-β3,
TGF-β131, TGF-β313, and TGF-β3H4 and then by adding
10 molar equivalents of sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce). Singly biotinylated
TGF-βs were separated from receptors and doubly and multiply
biotinylated forms by applying them to a Source S cation exchange
column (GE Healthcare) in the presence of 30% isopropanol at pH 4.0
and eluting with a linear 0–0.5 M NaCl gradient. Biotinylated
TGF-βs were captured by injecting them over a CM5 sensor chip
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) to which 5000 RU streptavidin had
been covalently attached to all four flow cells using an amine coupling
kit (GE Healthcare). Surface densities of captured TGF-βs were
kept at 50–300 RU to minimize rebinding artifacts. Binding
assays were performed by injecting 2-fold serial dilutions of the
receptors in duplicate or triplicate in HBS-EP buffer (GE Healthcare)
at a flow rate of 50 or 100 μL min–1 for kinetic
experiments. Surfaces were regenerated by a brief injection of 4 M
guanidine hydrochloride (10 s contact time at a flow rate of 100 μL
min–1). Baseline correction was performed by double
referencing. Kinetic analyses were performed
by global fitting with a simple 1:1 model. Standard errors were obtained
from the variation in the fitted parameters.

Sandwich Assay for Quantifying
Chemoregulated Cell Migration
The chemoregulated migration
assay was performed as previously
described. This was accomplished by monitoring
the migration of dermal fibroblasts from the center of native collagen
gels where the TGF-βs had been added at concentrations of 1,
10, 100, and 1000 pg mL–1. The migration of the
fibroblasts was then quantified by counting the cells along the length
of the collagen-containing cylinder using a digitally stepped microscope.
The measurements for each TGF-β at each concentration were performed
in triplicate. The experiment was repeated three times, and the reported
values are the mean from a single representative experiment; reported
errors correspond to the deviation among replicates.

Results
Design
and Production of TGF-β313 and TGF-β131
The hypothesis
of this study is that the difference in KCO is mainly determined by intrinsic differences
in the stability of α-helix 3 and that the isoform-specific
biological activities arise from differences in KCO. This hypothesis is based on the differences in the
calculated helical propensity of α-helix 3, which is nearly
10-fold higher for TGF-β1 compared to TGF-β3 (Table ). These calculations, which were performed using
the program Agadir,, show that much but not all of
the difference in the helical stability is due to substitution of
an α-helix-stabilizing alanine at position 63 in TGF-β1
with an α-helix-destabilizing glycine in TGF-β3 (Figure B). The alternative explanation, that packing interactions
between monomers differ, seems unlikely since all of the residues
in the “heel” region against which α3 is packed
are conserved between TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 (Figure C,D). The residues within α-helix 3 that interact
with residues in the heel region are also the same, except residue
58, which is a histidine in TGF-β3 but a tyrosine in TGF-β1
(Figure C,D).

To investigate our hypothesis, two TGF-β chimeras
were generated
in which residues 54–75 were swapped between TGF-β1 and
TGF-β3 (Figure B). The swapped region
corresponds to the region shown to be flexible in TGF-β3,, and includes α-helix 3
(residues 57–68) as well as several flanking residues. There
are nine amino acid differences in the swapped region, including L54,
Q57, Y58, K60, A63, Q67, H68, G71, and A75 in TGF-β1 and A54,
T57, H58, T60, G63, T67, L68, E71, and S75 in TGF-β3. The expectation
was that the TGF-β1 variant with the α3 region from TGF-β3
(designated TGF-β131) would be altered such that the open form
was favored (KCO ≫ 1), while the
TGF-β3 variant with the α3 region from TGF-β1 (designated
TGF-β313) would favor the closed form (KCO ≪ 1). To generate the TGF-β131 and TGF-β313
chimeric proteins, the coding sequences of both were synthesized and
inserted into a T7-based expression vector. TGF-β313 was obtained
by expressing it in E. coli and refolding and purifying
it as described for TGF-β3. TGF-β131
was also expressed at a level comparable to that of TGF-β313
in E. coli, but attempts to refold the denatured
monomers into native disulfide-linked dimers were unsuccessful. The
parent protein, TGF-β1, is similarly behaved, and therefore
TGF-β131 was produced using the same CHO cell expression system
previously used to produce TGF-β1. TGF-β313 and TGF-β131, as well as another variant described
below designated TGF-β3H4, were found to run as a single band
at 25 kDa on SDS gels under nonreducing conditions, but as a single
band at 12.5 kDa under reducing conditions (, Figure S3).

Backbone Amide Assignments
The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of TGF-β3
includes many intense signals
in the random coil region that arise from residue 54–75, which
are disordered. The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of TGF-β313, when recorded under identical
conditions, 87% H2O, 5% D2O, 6% dioxane-d8, and 2% methanol-d3 at pH 2.9 and 40 °C, has significantly improved spectral dispersion
and much more uniform signal intensities. These improved spectral
features enabled full assignment (102/102 expected non-proline residues)
of the backbone resonances of TGF-β313 using a single 0.4 mM 15N, 13C sample and standard triple-resonance experiments
implemented on a 700 MHz spectrometer (Figure A).

Assigned 1H–15N HSQC spectra of TGF-β313
and TGF-β131. (A) Assigned HSQC of TGF-β313 with peaks
labeled by their one letter amino acid code and residue number. (B) 1H–15N HSQC of 15N-tyrosine selectively
labeled TGF-β131 overlaid with the HN plane of HNCO data for
Scheme 1 (cyan) labeled TGF-β131. (C) 1H–15N HSQC of 15N-leucine selectively labeled TGF-β131
(black contours) overlaid with the HN plane of an HNCO for Scheme
2 (green contours), Scheme 3 (magenta contours) and Scheme 4 (cyan
contours) labeled TGF-β131. Peak labeled with a green asterisk
(*) was observed in the HN planes of all HNCO data.

TGF-β131 was expressed at a high level and
could be readily
purified from the conditioned medium produced by the stably transfected
CHO cells, but it proved impractical to prepare an 15N
or 15N,13C uniformly labeled sample for assignment
purposes owing to the high cost of the culture medium. Therefore,
an alternative labeling strategy was adopted in which residues in
unique i–i+1 dipeptides were selectively labeled with the corresponding 13CO-labeled amino acid at position i and the corresponding 15N-labeled amino acid at position i+1. This strategy is designed
to enable definitive assignment of the amide of residue i+1 by recording
the 1H–15N plane of an HNCO. This strategy
was previously used to successfully assign a number of residues in
CHO-cell derived TGF-β1,, but has the disadvantage
that unambiguous assignment of each amide requires preparation of
a separate sample. This limited the number of amides that could be
definitively assigned; accordingly two judiciously chosen residues
inside and outside the swapped region (L62 and L64 and Y39 and L45,
respectively) were assigned. The residues inside the swapped region
corresponded to those that had {1H}-15N NOEs
greater than 0.75 (i.e., were rigid) in TGF-β1, but significantly
less than 0.75 in TGF-β3 (i.e., were flexible), while those
outside the swapped region were chosen in regions that had {1H}-15N NOEs greater than 0.75 (i.e., were rigid) in both
TGF-β1 and TGF-β3. The labeling schemes designed to assign
Y39, L45, L62, and L64 are listed in Table .

Selective Labeling Schemes for TGF-β131
scheme	13CO labeled	15N labeled	unique dipeptide	
1	Gly	Tyr	G38-Y39	
2	Cys	Leu	C44-L45	
3	Val	Leu	V61-L62	
4	Gly	Leu	G63-L64	
The 1H–15N HSQC of the
Scheme 1 sample
(13CO-Gly, 15N-Tyr) exhibited 7–8
strong signals, while the 1H–15N HSQC
spectra of the Scheme 2, 3, and 4 samples (all of which were labeled
with 15N-Leu, but with a different 13CO-labeled amino acid) each exhibited 11–12 strong signals.
These spectra, shown in black contours in Figure B,C, are largely consistent with expectations based on the
amino acid content of TGF-β131, which contains 7 tyrosine and
10 leucine residues. The corresponding 1H–15N planes of the HNCO spectra, in contrast, exhibit either a single
signal in the Scheme 1 sample (Figure A, cyan
contours) or one signal with a unique chemical shift and one signal
that has the same chemical shift in the Scheme 2, 3, and 4 samples
(Figure B, green, magenta, and cyan contours,
respectively). The single signal of the Scheme 1 sample and the unique
signals of the Scheme 2, 3, and 4 samples are presumed to correspond
to Y39, L45, L62, and L64, respectively. The same signal present in
each of the Scheme 2, 3, and 4 samples has a very narrow line width
and is presumed to be L2, which lies near the N-terminus and is highly
flexible.

Flexibility and Conformational Preference Switched for TGF-β313
and TGF-β131
The backbone amide {1H}-15N NOEs were measured for both TGF-β313 and TGF-β131
at 40 °C on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer (Figure A, B). TGF-β313 residues 59, 60, 63, 66, 67, and 68
in α-helix 3 all have high NOE values (&gt;0.75) (Figure A). This suggests that the α-helix 3 of TGF-β313
is structurally ordered, which is similar to TGF-β1, not TGF-β3
(, Figure S2). TGF-β131
residues 62 and 64 in α-helix 3 region have low NOE values (0.35
and 0.47 respectively), while residues Y39 and L45 have high NOE values
(&gt;0.75), indicating that the α-helix 3 region of TGF-β131
is flexible. Thus, substitution of residues 54–75 from TGF-β1
into TGF-β3 caused α3 to become rigid, while substitution
of residues 54–75 from TGF-β3 into TGF-β1 caused
α3 to become flexible.

NMR relaxation and secondary structure analysis
of TGF-β313
and TGF-β131. (A) {1H}-15N NOEs of TGF-β313.
{1H}-15N NOE values for residues 57, 58, 61
62, 64, and 65 in α-helix 3 region of TGF-β313 could not
be accurately measured due to peak overlap. (B) {1H}-15N NOEs of residues Y39, L45, L62, and L64 in TGF-β131.
(C) Secondary structure probabilities of TGF-β313 calculated
from NMR secondary shifts by the program PECAN; positive and negative values indicate α-helical and
β-strand probabilities, respectively. Secondary structure diagram
shown along the top corresponds to that of TGF-β1 (PDB 1KLC).

The secondary structure of TGF-β313 was assessed
by analyzing
the secondary shifts using the program PECAN, which provide a sensitive
and accurate indicator of secondary structure propensities. This showed that α3 is highly probable
in TGF-β313 (Figure C). To directly
confirm that α3 was present in TGF-β313, we recorded a
three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY spectrum and identified
numerous dαN(i,i+3) and αN(i,i+4) NOEs which are diagnostic
for well-ordered α-helices (, Figure S4). Thus, α3 is structurally ordered in TGF-β313,
which is similar to TGF-β1, not TGF-β3.

TGF-β313,
in addition to forming a stable α-helix 3,
is also expected to adopt the closed state, with α3 from one
monomer packing against the heel of the other monomer. To investigate
whether the stable α3 in TGF-β313 also promoted the “closing”
of the dimer, the assigned chemical shifts common to TGF-β3
and TGF-β313 were compared (Figure A).
This showed that there were three regions with relative large chemical
shift perturbations centered about Ile22, Leu28, and Tyr50. These
residues were found to be either in the heel region or in the prehelix
loop, which in the closed form of TGF-β3, directly interact
with α3 (Figure B). This indicates that
the conformation of TGF-β313 differs from TGF-β3, most
likely because it adopts a closed conformation similar to TGF-β1.

between TGF-β3 and TGF-β313 and TGF-β3 and TGF-β3H4,
respectively. Plotted values correspond to the average chemical shift
perturbation of 1H and 15N chemical shifts given
by Δav = [(Δδ2NH + Δδ2N/25)/2]1/2 between
corresponding residues. (B, D) Residues with the largest shift perturbations
between TGF-β3 and TGF-β313 and TGF-β3 and TGF-β3H4,
respectively, mapped onto the crystal structure of TGF-β3 (PDB
code 1TGJ).

The backbone 15N T1 and T2 relaxation
times for residues in regions of
regular secondary structure of TGF-β313 were found to have mean
values of 1116 ± 66 and 60.0 ± 7.0 ms, respectively, when
measured at a 15N frequency of 70.95 MHz. These relaxation
times correspond to an isotropic rotational correlation time (τc) of 12.7 ns, which is very close to the 12.2 ns rotational
correlation time of TGF-β1 deduced from backbone 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times measured at 50.68 MHz (, Tables S1 and S2). The correspondence of the correlation
times for TGF-β313 with those of TGF-β1 would be unexpected
if the monomers were not rigidly packed against one another as in
TGF-β1, thereby providing further evidence that TGF-β313
predominantly adopts the closed form with the two monomers rigidly
packed against one another.

Flexibility and Conformational Preference
Also Switched for
Helix-Stabilized TGF-β3 Variant, TGF-β3H4
The
data presented above clearly demonstrate that swapping the region
between residues 54–75 swaps the flexibility and the position
of the KCO equilibrium. The effect of
swapping residues 54–75 on KCO could
be through an increase in the intrinsic stability of α3, or
alternatively through alterations in interactions between residues
in α-helix 3 and residues in the heel region of the other monomer.
Though it was previously hypothesized that helical stability was the
major contributor to differences in KCO between TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, this was not directly evaluated
through the studies of the two chimeras, TGF-β313 and TGF-β131.
To evaluate this more directly, a helix-stabilized variant of TGF-β3
was designed that had just four amino acid substitutions relative
to TGF-β3. The substitutions include H58Y, G63A and T67Q within
α3 and A54L outside α3. The H58, G63, and T67 residues
of TGF-β3 were selected for substitution since Agadir calculations
showed that these residues contribute the greatest to the helical
stability of α3 in TGF-β1 (Table ). The Agadir calculations further showed that simultaneous substitution
of all three residues increases the helical stability of α3
in TGF-β3 such that it is comparable to that of TGF-β1
(Table ). Two of the substituted residues
within α3 are expected to have no direct contact with the opposing
monomer A63 and Q67, while the third substituted residue, H58 packs
against the other monomer with surface area of 117 Å2. The A54L substitution was selected because L54 packs against A63
in TGF-β1 and may therefore indirectly stabilize the helix.

The helix-stabilized TGF-β3 variant, TGF-β3H4, was expressed,
refolded, and purified using the same procedure as TGF-β313.
The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of TGF-β3H4
showed highly dispersed peaks with uniform intensities. This indicated
that TGF-β3H4 likely adopts an ordered structure, similar to
TGF-β1 and TGF-β313. To examine this more directly, a 15N,13C labeled TGF-β3H4 sample was prepared,
and its backbone resonances were assigned using standard triple-resonance
methodology (Figure A). To examine the backbone
flexibility, a 15N-labeled TGF-β3H4 sample was prepared,
and the backbone {1H}-15N NOEs were measured
(Figure B). The {1H}-15N NOE measurements showed that TGF-β3H4 had a similar overall
pattern as TGF-β313, including T60, V61, A63, and Q67 within
α3, which all had high (&gt;0.75) {1H}-15N NOE values. The analysis of secondary structure propensities using
the program PECAN further showed there is a high probability for helix
formation in the α3 region (Figure C).
Thus, TGF-β3H4 has a structurally ordered α-helix 3 region,
similar to TGF-β1 and TGF-β313. TGF-β3H4 also appears
to adopt the closed conformation as a comparison of the assigned chemical
shifts of TGF-β3H4 with those of TGF-β3 identified the
same three regions in the comparison of TGF-β313 and TGF-β3
(Figure C,D).

Circular Dichroism Measurements
The TGF-β isoforms
have been previously analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) under acidic
conditions. These studies showed that
the measured helical content of TGF-β1 matched that calculated
from its three-dimensional structure, while that of TGF-β3 was
much lower than expected (at the time the only available structure
was the crystal structure of TGF-β3, which as noted, adopts
the closed form). Thus, it should be
possible to complement the NMR measurements described above with CD
measurements. TGF-β1, TGF-β3, TGF-β313, TGF-β131,
and TGF-β3H4 were therefore analyzed by CD under conditions
comparable to that previously used in Pellaud’s study (10 mM
phosphoric acid, pH 2.9) (Figure ). The CD
spectrum of TGF-β1 shows more negative ellipticity at 220 nm
and more positive elliptictiy at 200 nm compared to TGF-β3,
consistent with the NMR analysis that shows that TGF-β1 has
greater helical content. The CD spectra of TGF-β313 and TGF-β3H4
were furthermore shown to be similar to that of TGF-β1, while
the TGF-β131 spectrum was shown to be similar to that of TGF-β3.
These results confirm the prior conclusions drawn from the NMR studies:
TGF-β1, TGF-β313, and TGF-β3H4 include a stable
α3 and are predominantly closed, while TGF-β3 and TGF-β131
include a disordered α3 and are predominantly open. The similarity
of the CD spectra for the proteins in the two groups further suggest
that the position of the KCO equilibrium
is also qualitatively similar; i.e., KCO for TGF-β313 and TGF-β3H4 is similar to that of TGF-β1,
and KCO of TGF-β131 is similar to
that TGF-β3.

Biological Activities
TGF-β1 and TGF-β3
are indistinguishable in most commonly used cell-culture assays to
assess TGF-β activity, such as growth inhibition or Smad phosphorylation
assays. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 have however been shown to be
distinguishable in a chemoregulated migration assay in three-dimensional
collagen matrices, which is thought to underlie their distinct functions
in dermal wound healing. The assay is
performed using a “sandwich” format in which dermal
fibroblasts are plated at the interface between an upper and lower
matrix compartment in the presence of an isotropic distribution of
test mitogen. The migration of the fibroblasts in response to the
different conditions is examined by quantifying their disposition
within the collagen matrix. TGF-β3 is active in the sandwich
assay, eliciting directional migration in response to cytokine distribution,
while TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 neither promote nor inhibit directional
migration. This assay was performed using TGF-β131, TGF-β313,
and TGF-β3H4, together with TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 as
controls (Figure ). The assay was repeated
three times, and errors were calculated by statistical analysis. TGF-β131 gained function in this assay
so that it induced migration similar to TGF-β3, while TGF-β313
lost function and thus does not induce migration, similar to TGF-β1.
TGF-β3H4 had significantly diminished activity compared to TGF-β3
and is similar, but not identical, to TGF-β1 (Figure ). These data show that the biological activity
correlates with KCO: TGF-β3 and
TGF-β131 both favor the open form (KCO ≫ 1) and potently induce migration, while TGF-β1, TGF-β313,
and TGF-β3H4 favor the closed form (KCO ≪ 1) and have little to no ability to induce migration.

in the absence of ligands ranged from 1.3 to 2.0% and is represented
by the dashed horizontal lines.

Receptor Binding Properties
TGF-β1 and TGF-β3
had previously been characterized in terms of binding TβRII
and recruiting TβRI using SPR-based methods with immobilized
biotinylated TGF-βs., These measurements,
while demonstrating very overall similar affinities and kinetics,
had shown small differences in the dissociation rate for TβRI
binding by the TGF-β:TβRII complex. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3
have a similar association rate for TβRI recruitment, but TGF-β3
has slower dissociation rate and hence a slightly greater affinity. To determine whether these small differences
in TβRI binding were caused by differences in KCO, SPR kinetic analysis was performed with biotinylated
TGF-β1, TGF-β3, TGF-β313, TGF-β131, and TGF-β3H4.
To minimize artifacts that might arise from biotinylation, TGF-βs
were each prebound to the purified TβRI and TβRII ectodomains
and then biotinylated. The biotinylated TGF-βs were then isolated
using high resolution ion-exchange chromatography under denaturing
conditions, which not only enabled complete removal of the receptors,
but also separation of singly, doubly, and multiply biotinylated forms.
The singly biotinylated TGF-βs were then captured onto a high
density streptavidin surface. The sensorgrams, along with the fitted
kinetic traces, are shown in Figure . The
tabulated rate and dissociation constants are presented in Table .

TGF-β313 and TGF-β131 are shown to retain the same
kinetics and affinity for binding TβRII as TGF-β3 and
TGF-β1. The small difference in TβRI recruitment by TGF-β1
and TGF-β3 noted in the prior study is reversed: TGF-β131
has a characteristically slow off-rate, which is similar to TGF-β3,
and TGF-β313 has a faster off-rate, similar to TGF-β1.
TGF-β3H4 binds TβRII with the same kinetics and affinity
as TGF-β3, but its kinetics and affinity for recruiting TβRI
are characteristic of TGF-β3, not TGF-β1 (Figure E, Table ). Thus, even though
TGF-β3H4 has a stable α-helix 3 and adopts the closed
form, this does not affect the kinetics of TβRI binding. Together,
these results show that the small difference in TβRI recruitment
is not correlated with the differences in KCO.

Discussion
The unique phenotypes of the TGF-β
isoform-specific null
mice are largely explained by differences in the expression patterns
of the isoforms, indicating that the diversification of the TGF-β
superfamily to include three closely related TGF-β isoforms
has largely been driven by advantages that arise from differences
in their spatial-temporal expression patterns.− The expansion of functionality
by duplicating genes to fine-tune spatial-temporal expression, without
altering the properties of the ligands so that they can be distinguished
by the signaling receptors or other binding proteins, does impose
the fundamental limitation that the isoforms can only achieve their
distinct functions without overlap in their expression patterns. Thus,
there is some advantage for ligands of the superfamily to be distinguished,
either by the signaling receptors or by other binding proteins that
differentially regulate access to the signaling receptors.

The
objective of this study was to investigate whether the previously
reported differences in the equilibrium between the closed and open
monomer arrangements, KCO, was caused
by differences in helical stability and whether the differences in KCO might contribute to the unique requirement
of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 in vivo that has been previously
suggested based on gene replacement, and other
studies.,− The construction of the chimeric
proteins, in which the unstable palm helix in TGF-β3 was swapped
into TGF-β1 and the stable palm helix in TGF-β1 was swapped
into TGF-β3, and analysis of these by NMR and CD, showed that
swapping the helical regions swapped their preferred conformation.
TGF-β313 was shown to adopt the closed conformation characteristic
of TGF-β1 (Figures –, ), while TGF-β131
was shown to adopt the open conformation characteristic of TGF-β3
(Figures –).
The migration of dermal fibroblasts through a matrix of native collagen
was shown to correlate with the preferred conformation of the ligand,
with the predominantly closed ligands lacking detectable chemoregulated
migration activity, and the open ligands possessing potent chemoregulated
migration activity (Figure ).

The primary
limitation of the chimeras is that it is not possible
to determine whether the altered properties—specifically the
shifts in the KCO equilibrium or changes
in migration—were a direct consequence of changes in the helical
stability or altered conformation, or whether the inclusion of sequence
from the other isoform affected the equilibrium and migration through
other mechanisms. This limitation was addressed by generating another
TGF-β3 variant, TGF-β3H4, in which only four residues
were substituted. The substitution of these four residues was predicted
to increase the helical stability to a similar extent as the TGF-β313
chimera, but because only four residues were substituted rather than
nine, this decreased the likelihood that these residues would alter
either the conformation or migration through other mechanisms. Thus,
the finding that TGF-β3H4 adopted the closed conformation and
lost most of its activity in the migration assay provides strong,
though not conclusive evidence, that the shift in the KCO equilibrium toward the closed state is caused by an
increase in helical stability and that the activity in the migration
assay is specifically due to the open conformation. The finding that
the migration activity of TGF-β3H4 was not entirely abolished
might be because KCO is not as far shifted
to the closed form as that of the TGF-β313. This is not apparent
from either the TGF-β3H4 α3 secondary structure propensities
or magnitude of the TGF-β3H4–TGF-β3 shift perturbations,
which were indistinguishable from those of TGF-β313, but is
suggested by the {1H}-15N NOE data, which showed
somewhat increased flexibility in the prehelix loop (Figure b).

To investigate the underlying mechanistic
basis by which the alterations
in the sequence and conformation of the TGF-βs might alter activity,
the binding properties of TGF-β313, TGF-β131, and TGF-β3H4
for the signaling receptors, TβRI and TβRII, were investigated
using SPR. The previous SPR studies performed in our laboratory showed
that TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bound TβRII with the same
overall affinity and kinetics, but had small differences in their
ability to cooperate with TβRII to bind and recruit TβRI. This, together with the accompanying structures
of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bound to the TβRI and TβRII
ectodomains (, Figure
S3), suggested that these differences were due to residues 51, 57,
and 60 within the TβRI binding interface, which differ between
TGF-β1 and TGF-β3.

The SPR binding studies reported here showed that TGF-β131
had a somewhat higher affinity for TβRI due to a somewhat slower
disassociation rate, while TGF-β313 has a somewhat lower affinity
for TβRI due to a somewhat faster disassociation rate (Table ). This change in TβRI binding by TGF-β131
and TGF-β313 is consistent with the swap of residues 57 and
60, although it is impossible to rule out that the altered conformation
might have also had an effect since the change in TβRI binding
also correlates with the change of conformation. The SPR binding studies
further showed that the ability of TGF-β3H4 to bind and recruit
TβRI was indistinguishable from that of TGF-β3. The absence
of an effect on TβRI binding is consistent with the substitution
of none of the residues known to affect TβRI binding, but it
is inconsistent with the altered conformation, which was closed for
TGF-β3H4, but open for TGF-β3. The overall conclusion,
therefore, is that the small differences in the rate at which TβRI
disassociates is determined by whether the TGF-βs include the
residues previously shown to influence TβRI binding, not whether
they adopt the open or closed state.

This finding is perhaps
not surprising as the TβRI- and TβRII-bound
forms of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 have been shown to both be
closed,, and the rate of dissociation is presumably
determined by the rate at which all of the stabilizing interactions,
including those between residues 51, 57, and 60 of TGF-β and
TβRI mentioned above, are simultaneously disrupted. The finding
that the TβRI association kinetics do not correlate with the
conformation of the TGF-βs is somewhat surprising given that
some of the TGF-βs are predominantly open and must undergo a
transition to the closed form upon binding TβRI (since the bound
forms for TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 have been shown to be closed,). The fact that the association rates do not correlate suggests
that the kinetics of the open and closing transition are likely fast
compared to other steps required for TβRI recruitment, which
might well be the case given that the TβRII N-terminus has previously
been shown to undergo a disorder-to-order transition as it binds TβRI.,,

This leads us to conclude
that the differential effect of the TGF-βs
in the migration assay is due to differential interactions with other
TGF-β binding proteins that might be present. These differential
interactions could be mediated by the overall conformational differences
between the TGF-βs, or alternatively through direct recognition
of the substituted amino acid residues. There is at present insufficient
data to distinguish these mechanisms, but it is nevertheless tempting
to speculate that it is the former, not the latter, as the opening
and closing of TGF-β results in a very large overall change
in conformation that has a high potential to be differentially recognized,
either structurally or as a result of differences in charge or hydrophobicity.

There are several TGF-β binding proteins known, including
membrane-bound nonsignaling receptors, such the type III receptor,
or soluble proteins, such as the shed form of the type III receptor,
α2-macroglobulin, or decorin. These proteins could be derived
from the relatively low levels of calf serum (1%) that were added
to the collagen gels or proteins that are secreted or shed by the
dermal fibroblasts. The majority of TGF-β binding proteins preferentially
bind one isoform over the others. TGF-β2 binds the soluble type
III receptor, for example, with an affinity that is roughly 3-fold
greater than TGF-β1 and 4-fold greater than TGF-β3. Both α2-macroglobulin and decorin
preferentially bind TGF-β1 and TGF-β2., Hence, α2-macroglobulin and decorin might bind
TGF-β3 more transiently compared to TGF-β1, which in turn
could increase the rate at which TGF-β3 diffuses through the
collagen gels compared to TGF-β1. Collagen isoforms have not
been reported to bind TGF-βs, but if they do have a slight propensity
to interact, this could lead to the observed differences in the migration
assay, as TGF-βs that are closed or open might have a differing
propensity to interact with collagen thus affecting their diffusion
through the collagen matrix. Abundant decorin and collagen is present
in the epidermis; thus it seems plausible that the TGF-βs are
differentially interacting with these molecules, as opposed to the
soluble type III receptor or α2-macroglubin, which are mainly
present in serum.

The results present here have shown that residues
within helix
3 determine whether TGF-βs adopt the open or closed state and
that the open or closed state is likely responsible for the differential
activity of TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, as least as it relates
to signaling activity in the epidermis. The fact that intrinsic differences
among the isoforms do contribute to their unique activities most likely
reflects an added adaptation that has enabled the TGF-βs to
take upon their unique and distinctive functions in vivo.
