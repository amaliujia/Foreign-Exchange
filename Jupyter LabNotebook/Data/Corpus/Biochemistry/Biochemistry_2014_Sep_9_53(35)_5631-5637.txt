Flavo-diiron
proteins (FDPs)
are soluble cytoplasmic enzymes that catalyze reductive scavenging
of dioxygen and/or nitric oxide in anaerobic or microaerophilic microorganisms.− The active sites of FDPs contain a unique combination
of nonheme diiron-carboxylate and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactors,
as shown in Scheme .

FDPs function as the
terminal component in catalysis of reduction
of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide using NADH as the source of reducing
equivalents in a process termed nitric oxide reductase (NOR) activity.
The nitric oxide reduction occurs at the fully reduced FDP active
site (FMNH2-FeIIFeII), which can
reduce up to four molecules of NO to two molecules of N2O, leading to the fully oxidized (FMN-FeIIIFeIII) active site. To separate the roles of the FMN and diiron sites
in NOR turnover, a deflavinated FDP (deflavo-FDP) from Thermotoga
maritima (Tm) was investigated. The X-ray crystal structure
of Tm deflavo-FDP (Protein Data Bank entry 1VME) retained the head-to-tail homodimeric
subunit arrangement and diiron site structure characteristic of flavinated
FDPs., The dithionite-reduced deflavo-FDP reacted
with ≤1 equiv of NO to form a stable antiferromagnetically
coupled diferrous-mononitrosyl species (FeII{FeNO}7) with ground spin state S = 1/2 due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the S = 2 FeII and S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 centers ({FeNO}7 is the Enemark–Feltham notation for ferrous-nitrosyl). This through-bond coupling requires retention
of at least one of the bridging iron ligands shown in Scheme ., Reaction of the reduced deflavo-FDP
with excess NO led to substoichiometric (with respect to diiron sites)
generation of N2O and a stable S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species. These reactions were proposed to occur as illustrated in
Scheme  (where the curved line underneath
the iron pairs represents bridging ligand(s) from the protein and/or
solvent). The putative antiferromagnetically coupled diferric product
of the N2O-generating pathway was inferred from the absence
of any other iron-associated EPR signals and the UV–vis absorption
difference spectra of the NO-reacted protein. The stable S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species in the NO-reacted protein was proposed to arise from
a portion of the diferrous-mononitrosyl sites in which the iron centers
became magnetically uncoupled upon addition of the second NO, presumably
as a consequence of loss of the bridging ligand(s). A stable diferrous-mononitrosyl
(S = 1/2 FeII{FeNO}7) species was also generated upon reaction of the fully reduced
flavinated FDP (FMNH2-FeIIFeII) active
site with ≤1 equiv of NO.

We have more recently reported that reaction of the fully
reduced
flavinated FDP with excess NO led to an antiferromagnetically coupled
diferrous-dinitrosyl (S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2) intermediate preceding FMNH2 oxidation and formation
of diferric sites. On the basis of those
results, we suggested that the S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2 could convert to S = 0 FeIIIFeIII (diferric) and N2O without redox
participation of the flavin cofactor. Mössbauer spectroscopy
was crucial to identification of these various iron species. Here
we report an analogous multispectroscopic approach to characterization
of intermediates and products in the deflavo-FDP reactions with NO.
Our results indicate that the apparent branching shown in Scheme  originates from two distinguishable types of ferrous
sites and not from two differing reactions of the S = 1/2 diferrous-mononitrosyl species. Together
with the previous reports,, our deflavo-FDP results
confirm that N2O formation can occur via conversion of
an S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2 intermediate
to S = 0 diferric and clearly demonstrate that this
conversion can occur without the flavin cofactor. All results reported
here were obtained on the Tm deflavo-FDP.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
and General Procedures
Reagents and buffers
were of the highest grade commercially available. All reagents, protein,
and media solutions were prepared using water that had been passed
through a Milli-Q ultrapurification system (Merck Millipore, Inc.)
to achieve a resistivity of 18 MΩ. The buffer used for all experiments
was 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS)
(pH 7.3), which is hereafter termed buffer. Expression, isolation,
and purification of Tm FDP and 57Fe-enriched Tm FDP, analyses of protein,
iron, and FMN, and preparation and calibration
of ∼1.8 mM nitric oxide aqueous stock solutions from gaseous
NO or ∼20 mM NO delivery equivalent stock solutions of disodium
1-[(2-carboxylato)pyrrolidin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium 1,2-diolate (PROLI-NONOate)
(Cayman Chemical Co.) were conducted
as described in the cited references. The as-isolated Tm FDP routinely
contained ∼2 Fe and ≤0.2 FMN per monomer for both natural
isotopic abundance and 57Fe-enriched proteins. The residual
FMN was removed by the previously described protocol. All deflavo-FDP samples used in this work were analyzed
to contain ∼2 Fe/protein monomer. Deflavo-FDP concentrations
were determined using an ε280 of 110000 M–1 cm–1 (previously determined using the bicinchonic
acid protein assay). All FDP concentrations are given in protein monomer,
i.e., in diiron site equivalents. Reduced deflavo-FDP was prepared
by addition of 1 molar equiv of sodium dithionite from a concentrated
stock solution to anaerobic as-isolated deflavo-FDP solutions in buffer
followed by incubation for ∼1 h at room temperature.

Manually
Mixed Mössbauer Spectral Samples of Reduced
Deflavo-FDP with Substoichiometric NO
All manipulations were
conducted in an anaerobic N2-filled glovebox equipped with
a liquid N2-cooled cold well (Vacuum Atmospheres Co.).
The samples were prepared at room temperature from 800 μL of
a 500 μM 57Fe-enriched reduced deflavo-FDP solution;
400 μL of this solution was pipetted into a Mössbauer
cup and frozen in the cold well. To the remaining 400 μL was
added 8 μL of a PROLI-NONOate stock solution in deoxygenated
10 mM NaOH containing 20 mM NO delivery equivalents. The protein/PROLI-NONOate
mixture was incubated for 5 min, then pipetted into a Mössbauer
cup, and frozen in the cold well. The frozen samples were removed
from the glovebox and stored at 77 K until data were collected.

Rapid Kinetics
Stopped-flow UV–vis absorption
spectrophotometry and RFQ spectral sample preparations were performed
essentially as described previously for the flavinated Tm FDP. More detailed descriptions of these procedures
for the deflavo-FDP are provided in the .

Spectroscopies
EPR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker
ESP 300E X-band spectrometer equipped with a model ESR 900 (Oxford
Instruments, Inc.) helium continuous-flow cryostat. The following
standard parameters were used for spectral collection: modulation
frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 10.5 G; conversion time,
81.92 ms; time constant, 5.12 ms. The microwave power and temperature
were adjusted to collect spectra under nonsaturating conditions, and
these values are listed in the figure captions. 57Fe Mössbauer
spectra were recorded with two spectrometers using a Janis Research
Super-Varitemp dewar. Isomer shifts are reported relative to Fe metal
at 298 K. The simulations of Mössbauer spectra were calculated
with least-squares fitting using SpinCount and the standard spin Hamiltonian
described previously.

Results and Discussion
Two Spectroscopically
Distinct Iron Sites in Reduced Deflavo-FDP
The as-isolated
deflavo-FDP Mössbauer spectrum (Figure A) showed a single doublet with parameters typical
of high-spin ferric centers (Table ). The
lack of effect of an applied magnetic field and the single sharp doublet
(line width Γ = 0.31 mm/s) at low temperatures was indicative
of an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between equivalent iron
centers to give an S = 0 spin state lowest in energy.
No EPR or Mössbauer spectroscopic features that could be assigned
to mononuclear high-spin ferric sites were apparent. On the basis
of the UV–vis absorption spectrum and EPR silence, the anaerobic
treatment of as-isolated deflavo-FDP with dithionite was presumed
to reduce the antiferromagnetically coupled diferric site to ferrous. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectral
data in Figure B and Table  confirmed that all the iron was indeed reduced to the ferrous
state. The Mössbauer spectra of the dithionite-reduced deflavo-FDP
showed two doublets having parameters typical of high-spin ferrous
(Table ). The corresponding species comprised
60 and 40% of the total iron and will be termed diFeII and
FeIIi (Figure B), respectively.
The Mössbauer parameters of diFeII were indistinguishable
from those of the diferrous site previously reported for the reduced
flavinated FDP (FMNH2-FeIIFeII). The FeIIi species was
not observed in the flavinated FDP, and on the basis of the evidence
presented below, we use the subscript “i” to indicate
that this species is “inactive” with respect to the
N2O-generating pathway.

FeII{FeNO}7 in the flavinated FDP. The magnetic parameters for the S = 3/2 simulation are as follows: D = 12 cm–1, E/D = 0, and A = (−26, −25, −27) T. The spectra were collected at 4.2 K (A–C)
or 100 K (D) with a 45 mT magnetic field applied parallel to the γ-ray
direction. All spectral samples contained 500 μM diiron site
equivalents.

Mössbauer Spectroscopy Reveals Differing
Reactivities
of diFeII and FeIIi with Substoichiometric
NO
The Mössbauer spectrum resulting from manual mixing
of reduced deflavo-FDP with substoichiometric NO obtained at 100 K
(Figure D) exhibited three doublets. The doublet
corresponding to diFeII of the unreacted deflavo-FDP was
absent. Two of the doublets had equal areas and exhibited Mössbauer
parameters indicative of FeII (δ = 1.15 mm/s, and
ΔEQ = 2.05 mm/s) and {FeNO}7 (δ = 0.69 mm/s, and ΔEQ = 1.59 mm/s) components of the S = 1/2 FeII{FeNO}7 species previously
observed in the flavinated FDP. The combined
area of the FeII{FeNO}7 doublets was within
error equal to that of the diFeII species (60%) in the
unreacted sample. The third doublet in Figure D with δ = 1.28 mm/s and ΔEQ = 3.04 mm/s was identical to that of FeIIi in unreacted deflavo-FDP. This FeIIi species
accounted for 30% of the iron in the NO-reacted sample, which was
less than the 40% FeIIi in the unreacted sample.
The remaining 10% of total iron in the NO-reacted sample was a magnetically
isolated S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species (δ ∼ 0.65 mm/s, and ΔEQ ∼ −1.9 mm/s), which was observed in the
low-temperature spectrum (Figure C). Thus,
with substoichiomeric NO, all of the diFeII reacted to
form S = 1/2 FeII{FeNO}7, whereas only a portion of FeIIi reacted to give an S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species. These results imply that diFeII has a higher affinity for NO than does FeIIi. The total percentage of NO-bound iron species, 40% (30% S = 1/2 FeII{FeNO}7 plus 10% S = 3/2 {FeNO}7), obtained from the Mössbauer spectra was in good
agreement with the ∼0.4 equiv of added NO per iron. The manual
mixing conditions for the Mössbauer samples (see ) indicated that the {FeNO}7 species formed with substoichiometric NO were stable on a time scale
of at least minutes. The lack of diferric species also indicated that
no turnover occurred with substoichiometric NO on this time scale.

A Stable S = 1/2 Diferrous-Mononitrosyl
Formed within 100 ms of Mixing Reduced Deflavo-FDP with Substoichiometric
NO
Previously reported manual addition of ∼1 equiv
of NO to reduced deflavo-FDP resulted in a UV–vis absorption
spectral signature for {FeNO}7. The stopped-flow UV–vis absorption spectral time course (Figure A) developed the same {FeNO}7 spectral
signature with features at 420 nm (ε = 1350 M–1 cm–1), 459 nm (ε = 1300 M–1 cm–1), and 630 nm (ε = 400 M–1 cm–1) within ∼60 ms of mixing. The corresponding
300 s time course (Figure B) showed that this
{FeNO}7 spectral species was stable for at least several
minutes, which was also consistent with the manually mixed samples. Similarly, the 200 ms RFQ EPR spectrum of reduced
deflavo-FDP mixed with substoichiometric NO (∼0.6 NO per two
irons) exhibited the expected S = 1/2 EPR spectrum of FeII{FeNO}7 (Figure C),, and the spin concentration in
the RFQ sample was nearly equal to the concentration of the delivered
NO.

reduced deflavo-FDP stopped-flow mixed with deoxygenated buffer in
place of NO-containing buffer. Spectra in panel A were obtained in
13 ms intervals after the initial 1.3 ms spectrum. Concentrations
immediately after mixing were 190 μM reduced deflavo-FDP and
155 μM NO. The extinction coefficient axis is based on the delivered
NO concentration. (C) RFQ EPR spectra of 950 μM reduced deflavo-FDP
mixed with 560 μM NO (concentrations after mixing) in buffer
at 4 °C and quenched at 200 ms. The EPR spectrum was collected
at 4 K with a microwave power of 2.1 mW. The S = 1/2 species was at a concentration of 520 μM
as determined by double integration against a CuII(EDTA)
standard. The sharp g = 2 signal is due to a very small amount of an organic radical,
possibly residual FMN semiquinone. The minor sharp features straddling g = 2 are due to a Mn(II) impurity.

Rapid Reactions of Reduced Deflavo-FDP with Excess NO
Stopped-flow
UV–vis absorption spectral time courses for reactions
of reduced deflavo-FDP with excess NO (Figure ) showed the formation of two successive {FeNO}7 species
followed by a decay phase. The initial spectrum at 1.3 ms after the
mixing dead time (Figure A) exhibited a shoulder
at ∼420 nm, which is a characteristic feature in the absorption
spectrum of FeII{FeNO}7 (cf. Figure ). This shoulder became
less prominent as the time course approached 130 ms, during which
a more intense {FeNO}7 absorption spectrum developed. This
more intense absorption was maximized at ∼130 ms with features
at 340 nm (ε = 3000 M–1 cm–1), 453 nm (ε = 2000 M–1 cm–1) and 630 nm (ε = 500 M–1 cm–1). These features and the 453 nm extinction are consistent with conversion of essentially all the ferrous centers
to {FeNO}7 within 130 ms. The corresponding stopped-flow
reaction monitored over a 300 s time course (Figure B) showed gradual but not complete disappearance of the {FeNO}7 spectrum. Little or no further decrease in the spectral intensity
of Figure B was observed beyond 300 s. The
300 s UV–vis absorption spectrum resembles that of manually
mixed samples and, as inferred for those
samples, likely contains contributions from {FeNO}7 and
diferric spectra (see below).

in 13 ms increments up to 130 ms. The spectra in panel B were collected
on a logarithmic time scale from 130 ms to 300 s. Concentrations immediately
after mixing were 180 μM reduced deflavo-FDP and 900 μM
NO in buffer. The extinction coefficient axis is based on diiron site
concentration. Arrows indicate directions of absorbance changes. This
figure was reproduced from the Supporting Information of ref (). Copyright 2014 American
Chemical Society.

Corresponding RFQ EPR
spectra for the reaction of reduced deflavo-FDP
with excess NO collected at quench times of 130 ms, 10 s, and 60 s
are shown in Figure . The S = 1/2 FeII{FeNO}7 signal
was absent in all of these spectra. The signal with g values at 4.16 and 3.90 is due to an S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species, which formed within 100
ms after mixing and did not change in intensity over at least 60 s.
The average of the S = 3/2 spin
concentrations in the RFQ EPR samples was approximately 1 per diiron
site, indicating approximately half the iron consisted of magnetically
isolated {FeNO}7 centers, and that these centers formed
within 130 ms of mixing with excess NO. Because the stopped-flow UV–vis
absorption spectral time course with excess NO (Figure A) showed that essentially all the iron formed {FeNO}7 within 130 ms, approximately half the {FeNO}7 in
the RFQ samples of Figure  must be EPR silent
at a reaction time of ∼100 ms. It can be further inferred that
the residual {FeNO}7 UV–vis absorption at 300 s
in Figure B corresponds to the constant-intensity S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 EPR signal
in Figure . This in turn implies that the
EPR silent ∼50% of the rapidly formed {FeNO}7 decayed
to another EPR silent species with much lower UV–vis absorption
over the course of a few minutes. Anticipating the Mössbauer
results described below, we associate these two EPR silent species
with the diferrous-dinitrosyl and diferric species of the N2O-generating pathway shown in Scheme .

RFQ EPR spectral time course of the reaction of reduced deflavo-FDP
with excess NO in buffer at 2 °C. Spectra were recorded at 4
K and a microwave power of 260 μW. The reduced spectrum was
obtained prior to mixing with NO. Quench times following mixing with
NO are indicated in the figure. Concentrations immediately after mixing
were 120 μM diiron site equivalents and 1500 μM NO. The g = 1.98 signal in these spectra is due to the excess NO
in the samples. S = 3/2 spins
were quantified by comparison to an FeII(EDTA)NO standard.

RFQ Mössbauer Associates diFeII with the N2O-Generating Pathway
RFQ Mössbauer and parallel
EPR spectra of reduced deflavo-FDP mixed with 3 equiv of NO (the highest
practicable molar ratio that can be achieved in our system) were collected at quench times of 100 ms and
60 s. The RFQ Mössbauer spectra are shown in Figure , and the percentages of total iron for the various
species are listed in Table . At a reaction
time of 100 ms, the diFeII and FeIIi spectral features of the reduced deflavo FDP were replaced by three
new spectral species. Two of these species were doublets at 4 K, indicative
of either diamagnetic or integer spin systems. The parameters of the
most prominent doublet at 100 ms (δ = 0.74 mm/s, and ΔEQ = 1.85 mm/s) were nearly identical to those
assigned to the antiferromagnetically coupled [{FeNO}7]2 intermediate along the NOR catalytic pathway recently reported
for the flavinated FDP. Therefore, this
doublet in Figure  was assigned to the S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2 intermediate along
the N2O-generating pathway in Scheme . The second doublet in the 100 ms spectrum (diFeIII in
Table ) has spectral parameters identical
to those of the antiferromagnetically coupled diferric site in as-isolated
deflavo-FDP (Figure A and Table ). Because this doublet did not appear in the spectrum of
the starting reduced deflavo-FDP, it was assigned to the diferric
product of the N2O-generating pathway in Scheme . The Mössbauer spectral species assigned
to S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2 and diferric
sites at 100 ms (Figure B and Table ) together accounted for 62% of the total iron,
which was equal to that of diFeII prior to reaction with
NO. Between 100 ms and 60 s, the S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2 spectral species decreased from 55 to 10% of
the iron sites, and the diFeIII species increased from
7 to 47% percent of the total iron. Here again, the total of these
two species, 57%, was approximately the same as that of diFeII prior to reaction with NO. The diFeII, S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2, and diFeIII species
are thus logically assigned to the N2O-generating pathway
in Scheme .

parameters are given in the legend of Figure . The spectra were collected at 4.2 K and a magnetic field of 45

NO.

In the
absence of NO from Figure .

The third spectral component, labeled S = 3/2 in the 100 ms spectrum of
Figure , exhibited hyperfine splitting at
4 K and is characteristic
of magnetically isolated S = 3/2 {FeNO}7. The percentage
of the spectral species assigned to S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 in the 100 ms RFQ Mössbauer
spectrum (Figure B) was equal to that of FeIIi prior to reaction with NO (Table ). This observation is consistent with assignment of S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 as the
reaction product of FeIIi in the presence of
excess NO, as was the case with substoichiometric NO. No S = 1/2 FeII{FeNO}7 spectral
components were present in any of these RFQ Mössbauer spectra
(or in the parallel RFQ EPR spectra shown in Figure ).

RFQ EPR spectra of reduced deflavo-FDP mixed with 3 equiv of NO
in buffer and quenched at 100 ms and 60 s. The spectra were obtained
on portions of the same quenched samples used for the Mössbauer
spectra shown in Figure . The EPR spectra
were collected at 11 K and a microwave power of 200 μW. Concentrations
immediately after mixing were 500 μM reduced deflavo-FDP and
1500 μM NO. The sharp features straddling g = 2 are due to a Mn(II) impurity. The simulations (black lines)
are for an S = 3/2 species
with E/D = 0.021. The S = 3/2 spin concentrations were determined
with the software SpinCount developed by M. P. Hendrich.

Between 100 ms and 60 s, the RFQ Mössbauer
spectral species
assigned to S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 decreased from 38 to 20% in a manner concomitant with the
reappearance of the FeIIi species (Table ). EPR spectra of these RFQ Mössbauer samples
(Figure ) showed a parallel decrease in the
magnitude of the S = 3/2 signal.
This observation would seem to be inconsistent with the RFQ EPR time
course in Figure , which showed no such decrease
in the magnitude of the S = 3/2 signal. Unlike the time course in Figure , Figure  shows that the g = 1.98 signal due to free NO had disappeared in the 60 s spectrum.
Because the RFQ Mössbauer samples and their corresponding EPR
samples contained 1 mM total iron, a maximum of 1 mM of the initial
1.5 mM NO could have been consumed by reaction with the FDP (assuming
1 mol of NO reaction/mol of iron). This stoichiometry was consistent
with the 100 ms RFQ Mössbauer spectrum, which showed that all
of the iron is in the form of either {FeNO}7 or diferric
species. The disappearance of the free NO signal in the 60 s EPR spectrum
in Figure  could be due to escape of NO from
either the drive syringe or the mixing circuit in the interim between
collection of the 100 ms and 60 s samples. In any case, the decrease
in the level of the S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species and reappearance of FeIIi in the 60 s sample can be attributed to dissociation of NO
from the S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species accompanying the loss of free NO. This observation
is consistent with the apparently lower affinity of NO for FeIIi compared to that of diFeII observed
in the reactions with substoichiometric NO (Figure ). The absence of diFeII in the 60 s RFQ Mössbauer
spectrum (Table ) is consistent with the turnover
of diFeII according to Scheme .
The reappearance of FeIIi at 60 s indicates
its reaction with NO is limited to reversible formation of {FeNO}7.

Upon exposure of the 60 s RFQ Mössbauer sample
to air by
passing the sample in and out of a pipet for 5 min, the resulting
spectrum (Figure S1 of the ) showed two species: diFeIII (69%) and FeIIi (23%). The amount of diFeIII was approximately
equal to the amount of the diFeII species before the addition
of NO. The percentage of FeIIi species was unchanged,
indicating that it was not oxidized under these conditions. This air-exposed
sample was transferred to an EPR tube and frozen in liquid N2. A mononuclear S = 5/2 FeIII EPR signal (not shown) was detected at 26 K and determined
to account for 8% of the iron, an amount that was within the noise
of the Mössbauer spectrum. No S = 3/2 EPR signal was detected in this air-exposed sample.

N2O-Generating Pathway in FDP
The combined
spectroscopic and rapid kinetics results indicate that the N2O-generating pathway in deflavo-FDP is that shown in Scheme , which originates from the species identified here
as diFeII. This species accounted for 60% of total iron,
which is consistent with previously reported yields of N2O from reactions of reduced deflavo-FDP with excess NO. Our Mössbauer results verify the ultimate
production of antiferromagnetically coupled diferric sites (diFeIII) quantitatively upon reaction of the diFeII species
with excess NO. These NO-generated diferric sites are spectroscopically
indistinguishable from those in the as-isolated FDP. We have no direct
spectroscopic evidence of bridging ligand(s) in the diFeII species. However, because all the other species in Scheme  must contain bridging ligands to mediate their
antiferromagnetic coupling, retention of at least one of the bridging
ligands shown in Scheme  would seem to be
a reasonable presumption for diFeII.

Our results
associate the S = 3/2 {FeNO}7 species in the deflavo-FDP with an inactive ferrous species
(FeIIi), which was not detected in the flavinated
FDP. In the as-isolated deflavo-FDP,
we observed only one population of iron, consisting of antiferromagnetically
coupled diferric sites (STot = 0). Similarly,
the crystal structure of our preparation of the as-isolated deflavo-FDP
showed intact diiron sites having the structure depicted in Scheme  in both subunits of the homodimer. The minority population of FeIIi sites
must, therefore, have been generated during or after reduction of
the as-isolated deflavinated protein.

All of the species along
the N2O-generating pathway
shown in Scheme  for the deflavo-FDP had spectroscopic
parameters and kinetic behaviors very close to or indistinguishable
from their counterparts in the flavinated FDP. As was the case for the flavinated protein, only one sharp
Mössbauer doublet was observed for the diferrous-dinitrosyl
(S = 0 [{FeNO}7]2) species
in the deflavo-FDP, consistent with very similar coordination spheres
for the individual {FeNO}7 centers. Despite these nearly
identical Mössbauer parameters, the diFeII site
of the deflavo-FDP appeared to have a significantly higher affinity
for the second NO compared to that of the diferrous site in the flavinated
FDP. This higher second NO affinity of the diFeII site
in the deflavo-FDP was inferred from the absence of the diferrous-mononitrosyl
and presence of the diferrous-dinitrosyl species at 100 ms in the
RFQ reaction with excess NO (Figure  and Table ). The RFQ reaction of reduced flavinated FDP with
the same excess of NO, on the other hand, showed a substantial amount
of the diferrous-mononitrosyl species along with the diferrous-dinitrosyl
species in the 100–200 ms time range (which preceded any significant
FMNH2 oxidation). How the
absence of the FMN cofactor could lead to this increased second NO
affinity of the diFeII site in the deflavo-FDP is not obvious,
given the close resemblance of the protein and diiron site structures
in the Tm deflavo-FDP to those of other flavinated FDPs.,, In any case, our results confirm
that catalytically competent N2O generation in FDP can
occur via conversion of an antiferromagnetically coupled [{FeNO}7]2 site to a diferric site and that the FMN cofactor
is not required for this conversion.
