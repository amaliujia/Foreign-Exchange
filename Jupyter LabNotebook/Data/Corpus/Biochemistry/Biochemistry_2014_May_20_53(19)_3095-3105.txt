The triggers
for the aberrant
formation of extracellular plaques of the amyloid β (Aβ)
peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of the protein tau
remain as critical unanswered questions in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) research. Although the amyloid cascade hypothesis posits that
the aggregation-prone Aβ peptides are the causative agents in
AD, deposition of Aβ into the ordered
amyloid fibrils that are the primary component of plaques correlates
only weakly with disease severity. Subsequent
studies have suggested therefore that the primary toxic species in
AD are lower-molecular weight aggregates of Aβ lacking the highly
organized structure of amyloid fibrils. Supporting this hypothesis, numerous studies have demonstrated that
soluble Aβ aggregates, including both oligomers (aggregates
consisting of 2–20 peptides) and protofibrils (intermediates
on the amyloid fibril formation pathway consisting of hundreds of
peptides), are neurotoxic in cell culture and their presence correlates
with the progression of AD., Definitive proof of
the “toxic oligomer” hypothesis has yet to emerge, however,
hampered by a critical lack of clarity regarding the mechanism of
neuronal toxicity and the structures of the diverse array of nonfibrillar
assemblies of Aβ formed in vivo and even in vitro, motivating efforts
to characterize the structural details of the assembly process.

Formed by progressive proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor
protein (APP), Aβ peptides are found in lengths ranging from
39 to 49 amino acids. Aβ40 and Aβ42
are the primary products of the stepwise cleavage by γ-secretase
of the C99 C-terminal fragment of APP along two lineages: Aβ49
→ Aβ46 → Aβ43 → Aβ40 →
Aβ38/37 and Aβ48 → Aβ45 → Aβ42
→ Aβ39. Aβ40, the most
abundant, 40-amino acid form, is significantly less prone to aggregation
than Aβ42, the 42-amino acid form extended at the C-terminus
by two hydrophobic residues, isoleucine and alanine. Mutations in APP that result in higher ratios of Aβ42
to Aβ40 cause familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD), underscoring
the connection between the aggregation propensity of the C-terminal
region of Aβ and the occurrence of AD. Although Aβ peptides are primarily unstructured as monomers,
NMR experiments probing backbone and side chain dynamics have demonstrated
that Aβ42 has a more rigid C-terminal region compared to that
of Aβ40,− suggesting that slower motions in this region contribute
to the enhanced aggregation propensity of Aβ42. Recent technical
advances have made it possible to characterize the structure of both
fibrillar− and nonfibrillar (oligomeric and protofibrillar)
aggregates− of Aβ and their interactions with monomeric Aβ with atomistic resolution despite the challenges
associated with the large size, disordered structure, and transient
nature of aggregates. Using dark-state exchange saturation transfer
(DEST) NMR to probe the atomic-resolution structure and dynamics of
peptides within cytotoxic Aβ protofibrillar aggregates ranging
from 2 to 20 MDa lacking the linear, unbranched ordered structure
of mature amyloid fibrils, we have recently demonstrated that the
two additional residues in Aβ42 significantly slow motions across
the entire C-terminal region of Aβ42 (residues 31–42)
in the protofibril-bound state, suggesting that slowed motions may
contribute to aggregation propensity.

Although the toxicity of oligomeric forms of Aβ and
their
presence in disease are well-established, the trigger for the formation
of toxic oligomers from the constitutively present Aβ peptides
is unknown. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that other
Aβ variants, including N-terminally truncated pyroglutamate-modified
Aβ (e.g., pE3-42) and extended C-terminal forms (e.g., Aβ43),
may be more prone to aggregation than Aβ42 and may play a critical
role in AD by nucleating Aβ aggregation., Bearing a single additional threonine at the C-terminus relative
to Aβ42, Aβ43 appears more frequently in AD amyloid plaques
than Aβ40 despite a 1000-fold lower
cortical concentration. Aβ43 is
enriched 20- and 40-fold in the frontal and occipital cortices, respectively,
of patients with sporadic AD compared to nondiseased controls, twice
the enrichment of Aβ42 and 1 order of magnitude more enriched
than Aβ40. In a transgenic APP-expressing
mouse model of AD, Aβ43 is the earliest depositing Aβ
species, suggesting Aβ43 plays a crucial role in the early stages
of AD progression as a nucleator of Aβ aggregates. Previous studies have demonstrated that Aβ43
has aggregation properties similar to those of Aβ42,, yet Aβ43 is significantly more neurotoxic when applied to
cells in culture. Furthermore, earlier
onset of memory impairment, neuropathology, and plaque formation is
observed in a mouse model of AD in which a knock-in γ-secretase
bearing an FAD mutation increases the level of Aβ43 production
without changing Aβ42 levels.

Given the demonstrated potential of Aβ43 to be a nucleator
of toxic aggregates in AD, several important open questions remain
regarding the biophysical chemistry of Aβ43. Is Aβ43 more
prone to forming toxic aggregates than Aβ42? If so, why does
the addition of a hydrophilic amino acid at the C-terminus of Aβ
lead to greater aggregation propensity typically associated with hydrophobically
driven self-association? A clear understanding of the biophysical
properties of Aβ43 and its aggregates will provide insight into
its involvement in AD and serve as critical data for a potential target
for future AD therapeutics. In this study, we characterize the monomeric
and protofibril-bound states of Aβ43 under conditions that stabilize
protofibrils using solution NMR experiments sensitive to both the
structure and motions of Aβ peptides, properties that are known
to distinguish the aggregation propensity of shorter Aβ variants.
By demonstrating that the additional C-terminal threonine speeds and
enhances protofibril formation, alters the C-terminal monomer structural
ensemble, and contributes to slower motions of the peptide in both
the monomeric and protofibril-bound states, we provide a detailed
characterization of the aggregation and structural properties of Aβ43
that contribute to its unique role in AD.

Materials and Methods
Preparation
of Aβ Samples
Uniformly 15N-labeled Aβ43,
Aβ42, and Aβ40 were purchased from
rPeptide (Bogart, GA). To remove preformed aggregates, samples were
prepared from NaOH-treated lyophilized stocks as described previously. Aβ43 samples were diluted to concentrations
of 120, 25, and 15 μM in 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) and a 90% H2O/10% D2O mixture and maintained at 10 °C
at all times unless otherwise noted. Protofibril formation of 120
μM Aβ43 was monitored using a time course of 1H–15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC)
correlation spectra cross peak intensities. Establishment of an equilibrium
between monomers and protofibrils (i.e., &lt;10% change per day in
the concentration of monomers as measured by monomer resonance intensities)
in 120 μM Aβ43 samples occurred between 24 and 48 h, and
NMR experiments characterizing monomer–protofibril interaction
were performed after this point. For characterization of transverse
relaxation rates and scalar coupling constants of monomeric Aβ
peptides, 25 μM Aβ42 and 50 μM Aβ40 were prepared
as described above. Measurements of 1H–13C HSQC at natural abundance 13C were taken in 20 mM sodium
phosphate (pH 6.8) to prevent 13C signals arising from
HEPES buffer.

To investigate the effects of secondary structure
on Aβ chemical shifts and R2 values,
we prepared lyophilized stocks of 15N-labeled Aβ43
and Aβ42 as described above and diluted them to 100 μM
in 7.2 M urea, 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.9), and a 95% H2O/5% D2O mixture.

Electron Microscopy
Aliquots for
transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) studies were taken from 120 μM Aβ43 NMR
samples and diluted to 165 nM with 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) and a 90%
H2O/10% D2O mixture. Four microliters of the
diluted Aβ43 solution was immediately spotted onto an ultrathin
carbon film on holey carbon support grids (product code 01824, Ted
Pella, Reading, CA), washed three times with deionized H2O, stained with 5 μL of 3% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, Hatfield, PA) for 60 s, blotted, and left to air-dry. TEM
sample grids were then imaged with a Philips 410 transmission electron
microscope.

Solution NMR Experiments
All NMR
experiments were recorded
at 10 °C using a Bruker Avance III HD NMR spectrometer operating
at a 1H frequency of 850 MHz equipped with a Bruker TCI z-axis gradient cryogenic probe. Experimental sweep widths
and acquisition times (i.e., resolution) and the number of transients
were optimized for the necessary resolution, experiment time, and
signal-to-noise ratio for each experiment type but kept constant for
the same experiment conducted with different peptide (i.e., Aβ40,
Aβ42, and Aβ43) samples and different concentration conditions.

To measure the difference in transverse relaxation rates in the
presence and absence of Aβ43 protofibrils, in-phase 15N transverse relaxation rates (15N R2) were measured for Aβ43 at 120 and 25 μM with
an interleaved Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG)
experiment (hsqct2etf3gpsi3d, Topspin version 3.2, Bruker). Each interleaved
experiment comprises 90* and 1360* complex data pairs in the indirect 15N and direct 1H dimensions, respectively, with
corresponding acquisition times of 66 and 160 ms and sweep widths
of 15.8 and 10 ppm centered at 119 and 4.9 ppm, respectively. A CPMG
field of 556 Hz was used for all transverse relaxation measurements
with total R2 relaxation CMPG loop lengths
of 16.4, 32.9, 65.7, 131.4, 197.2, and 295.7 ms. An interscan delay
of 2.5 s was used. Data were processed with nmrPipe as follows. Data were apodized with a 10 Hz Gaussian function
for the 1H dimension and a cosine bell function for the 15N dimension. To resolve peaks for residues D7 and D23 only,
spectra were additionally processed separately with the following
change: free induction decays were apodized with a 2 Hz exponential
line broadening for the 1H dimension. Best-fit R2 relaxation rates were calculated by least-squares
optimization of 1H/15N peak intensities to single-exponential
decay functions. Given the low NMR signal intensity due to only ∼12
μM Aβ43 remaining monomeric at a total concentration of
120 μM, independent measurements of R2 were recorded, and the resulting transverse relaxation rates were
averaged. ΔR2, the difference in 15N R2 values in the presence (120
μM) and absence (25 μM) of protofibrils, was then calculated.

Dynamical differences in monomeric (15 and 25 μM samples)
Aβ42 and Aβ43 were observed by measurement of 15N R1, temperature-compensated 15N R2, and heteronuclear NOE experiments
using standard pulse sequences (hsqct1etf3gpsi3d, hsqct2etf3gpsitc3d,
and hsqcnoef3gpsi, respectively, from Topspin version 3.2). Each R2 experiment comprised six interleaved CPMG 15N R2 relaxation times of 16.4,
49.3, 82.2, 131.4, 197.2, and 263.7 ms at a CPMG field strength of
556 Hz. Each interleaved two-dimensional experiment comprised 128*
and 1360* complex data points in the indirect 15N and direct 1H dimensions, respectively, with corresponding acquisition
times of 94 and 160 ms and sweep widths of 15.8 and 10 ppm centered
at 119 and 4.9 ppm, respectively. Experiments were conducted with
16 transients per free induction decay and an interscan delay of 2.5
s, resulting in a total experiment time of 2 days. Data were processed
as described above. Each R1 experiment
comprised seven interleaved 15N R1 relaxation times of 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, and 1000
ms, with acquisition and processing parameters identical to those
described for R2. Heteronuclear NOE experiments
were conducted with a 5 s interscan delay (&gt;5T1 as measured), interleaving FIDs with and without saturation,
and 48 transients per free induction decay, with acquisition and processing
parameters identical to those described for R2.

To determine if differences in chemical shift and R2 observed for Aβ43 and Aβ42 arise
due to
structural changes, 1H–15N HSQC spectra
and temperature-compensated 15N R2 experiments were measured for 100 μM Aβ43 and
Aβ42 in 7.2 M urea, as described above. Each R2 experiment comprised six interleaved CPMG 15N R2 relaxation time points of 16.4,
49.3, 82.2, 131.4, 197.2, and 263.7 ms at a CPMG field strength of
556 Hz. Each interleaved two-dimensional experiment comprises 128*
and 1360* complex data points in the indirect 15N and direct 1H dimensions, respectively, with corresponding acquisition
times of 74 and 160 ms and sweep widths of 20 and 10 ppm centered
at 117.75 and 4.9 ppm, respectively. Experiments were conducted with
four transients per free induction decay and an interscan delay of
2.5 s, resulting in a total experiment time of 5.5 h. Data were processed
as described above.

Probing of the protofibril-bound state of
Aβ43 present at
120 μM was accomplished with dark-state exchange saturation
transfer (DEST) NMR spectroscopy using a series of interleaved, HSQC-based
experiments., Briefly, initial 1H magnetization is transferred to 15Nz by a refocused INEPT element, preferentially saturated in
the protofibril-bound state by 400 ms 15N radiofrequency
(RF) continuous wave pulses applied at a power of 500 or 375 Hz and 15N carrier frequency offsets between 6 and −6 kHz (for
500 Hz, 6, 4, 2.5, −2.5, −4, and −6 kHz offsets;
for 375 Hz, 4, 2.5, and −2.5 kHz offsets; three reference experiments
with no applied RF field), transferred to the NMR-visible monomeric
species by chemical exchange, and detected after INEPT transfer to 1H. Each interleaved two-dimensional experiment comprises 90*
and 2048* complex data points in the indirect 15N and direct 1H dimensions, respectively, with corresponding acquisition
times of 66 and 229 ms and sweep widths of 15.8 and 10.5 ppm centered
around 119 and 4.9 ppm, respectively. Data were processed as described
above. Attenuation of the NMR signal due to dark-state exchange saturation
transfer of each resonance was normalized to the average intensity
of each resonance in the three interleaved reference experiments (with
no RF power).

Quantification of Spectral Differences between
Monomeric Aβ42
and Aβ43
Chemical shift differences between Aβ42
and Aβ43 monomers were obtained from 1H–15N HSQC experiments measured at 10 and 37 °C. Each experiment
comprised 64* and 2048* complex data points in the indirect 15N and direct 1H dimensions, respectively, with corresponding
acquisition times of 31 and 229 ms and sweep widths of 24 and 10.5
ppm centered at 119 and 4.9 ppm (4.7 ppm at 37 °C), respectively.
Experiments were conducted with eight transients per free induction
decay. Data were processed as described above. To resolve the overlap
for residues D7, A21, V24, I31, I32, and M35, direct 1H
dimension data were separately processed with 1 Hz exponential line
broadening.

1H–13C HSQC experiments
conducted at 10 °C comprised 256* and 1024* complex data points
in the 13C and direct 1H dimensions, respectively,
with 96 transients per free induction decay. Data were processed as
described above.

For 100 μM Aβ43 and Aβ42
samples prepared in
7.2 M urea, chemical shift differences were quantified from similar 1H–15N HSQC experiments. Each experiment
comprised 128* and 2048* complex data points in the indirect 15N and direct 1H dimensions, respectively, with
corresponding acquisition times of 62 and 229 ms and sweep widths
of 24 and 10.5 ppm centered at 119 and 4.9 ppm, respectively. Experiments
were conducted with two transients per free induction decay. Data
were processed as described above, with 6.5 Hz Gaussian line broadening
in the direct 1H dimension.

3JHN-Hα scalar
coupling constants for 50 μM Aβ40, 25 μM Aβ42,
and 25 μM Aβ43 were obtained from alternate processing
of the high-signal-to-noise ratio HSQC experiment derived from a 15N R2 relaxation time point (16.4
ms) of the temperature-compensated 15N R2 experiments (see above) for 10 °C values, and from
HSQC spectra (see above) for 37 °C values. Free induction decays
were apodized with 1 Hz exponential line broadening in the direct 1H dimension, and a cosine bell function in the indirect 15N dimension. 3JHN-Hα values were determined by line-shape analysis using a custom script
in the software program R where the center position, widths, and intensities
of two Lorentzian functions were best fit to the 1H dimension
slices for the resonances corresponding to each backbone 1H–15N pair.

DEST Model Fitting
Kinetic and dynamic parameters describing
Aβ43 monomer–protofibril interactions and the Aβ43
protofibril-bound state were derived from experimental NMR data with
DESTfit as previously described. Briefly,
DESTfit was run with a pseudo-two-state fit type with the apparent
first-order association rate constant (konapp) set to the
maximal observed ΔR2, as previously
conducted in the analysis of DEST data for Aβ40 and Aβ42.,

Results
Aβ43 Assembles into Protofibrils Faster
and to a Greater
Extent Than Aβ42 or Aβ40
To determine the in vitro aggregation properties of Aβ43, 1H–15N HSQC peak intensities of resolved resonances
(Figure ) were monitored as a function of
time for 15N-labeled Aβ43 (120 and 25 μM).
At low concentrations (25 μM), Aβ43 aggregation is minimal
and Aβ43 remains ≈95% monomeric after 2 days. However,
at a higher concentration (120 μM), Aβ43 aggregates rapidly
with the intensity of NMR signals decreasing to ∼10% of the
original value within 1 day (Figure a). Transmission
electron microscopy analysis of 120 μM Aβ43 over time
confirms that the loss of the monomeric Aβ43 signal intensity
is concomitant with the formation of protofibrils. Protofibrils can
be detected as little as 1 h after sample creation and are present
at a much higher concentration after 24 h (Figure b,c). Although the atomic level structure and the heterogeneity
of the contacts stabilizing the core of protofibrils formed by each
Aβ variant are unknown, Aβ43 protofibrils are morphologically
similar as determined by microscopy to those we have previously observed
for Aβ42 and Aβ40. The rate
of aggregation can be described by fitting 1H–15N HSQC peak intensities to the exponential decay function I(t)/I0 = (1
– A1)e–t/τ1 + A1, where
τ1 is a time constant for protofibril formation and A1 is a constant representing the fraction remaining
monomeric after protofibril formation reaches equilibrium. Best-fit
parameters for Aβ43 protofibril formation under these conditions
are as follows: τ1 = 6 ± 1 h, and A1 = 10 ± 4%. This aggregation is much more rapid
than for Aβ40 or Aβ42, each of which requires &gt;1 week
to complete protofibril formation under identical conditions. Protofibril formation also proceeds to a greater
extent for Aβ43. After protofibril formation for 2 weeks, only
12 μM peptide remains monomeric compared to 20 μM Aβ42
or 120 μM Aβ40 at similar concentrations. Therefore, the addition of T43 both accelerates, and decreases
the critical concentration for, Aβ protofibril formation. At
37 °C, samples at concentrations of 25 μM that are stable
at 10 °C rapidly aggregate (Figure S1 of the ) into micrometer length fibrillar structures
much larger than the protofibrils formed at higher concentrations
at 10 °C, consistent with observations that low-temperature conditions
stabilize not only the monomer but also the protofibrillar intermediates. As observed for aggregation at 10 °C, faster
rates of monomer signal decay are observed for Aβ43 (τ1 = 0.45 ± 0.02 h, and A1 =
12 ± 1%) than for Aβ42 (τ1 = 0.94 ±
0.17 h, and A1 = 23 ± 5%).

Aβ43 aggregates into protofibrillar species
in a concentration-dependent
and time-dependent manner. (a) The ratio of monomeric NMR signal intensity
[I(t)/I0] decays exponentially as a function of time. Aβ43 at concentrations
of 25 μM (gray) and 120 μM (black) was monitored via HSQC
cross peak intensities for over 2 weeks. The significantly slower
aggregation of similar concentrations of Aβ42 (160 μM,
red) and Aβ40 (150 μM, blue) under identical conditions
is shown for comparison (data for Aβ40 and Aβ42 from ref ()). Transmission electron

are visible as little as 1 h after sample preparation and (c) protofibrils
are present at a higher concentration after 24 h. Arrows highlight
some of the protofibrils present, although many more are evident within
each image. Scale bars represent 200 nm.

C-Terminal Motions of Aβ43 Monomers Slowed Compared to
Those of Aβ42 Monomers
The following series of NMR
experiments characterizing the structure and dynamics of the monomeric
and protofibril-bound states of Aβ43 compared to Aβ42
(Figure ) provides a rationale for how the
addition of T43 results in the observed differences in aggregation.
Fast (picosecond to nanosecond) time scale motions of the backbone
positions of monomeric Aβ43 were compared to those of Aβ42
to determine if slower peptide dynamics contribute to the increased
aggregation propensity of Aβ43, as observed by Wang and co-workers
for Aβ40 and Aβ42. Therefore,
we measured 15N R2, 15N R1, and heteronuclear NOE for both
Aβ42 and Aβ43 under identical conditions. As expected
for the hydrophilic N-terminal region (residues 3–10), no significant
differences were observed between relaxation parameters for Aβ43
and Aβ42, showing that the N-terminal regions of Aβ behave
the same regardless of C-terminal length. However, 15N R2 values for residues 17–42 in Aβ43,
encompassing the entire central and C-terminal hydrophobic regions,
are significantly higher than those for Aβ42 (Figure a), suggesting Aβ43 has slower motions than
Aβ42 across the majority of the peptide. To confirm that the
observed increases in R2 values are not
the result of interactions between Aβ43 monomers and spontaneously
formed trace protofibrils potentially present at a concentration of
25 μM, R2 values were measured for
freshly prepared 15 μM Aβ43 where the concentration of
any trace aggregates would be lower. Although the signal-to-noise
ratio decreased and the uncertainty in R2 increased, no systematic decrease in R2 was observed for Aβ43 at 15 μM compared to Aβ43
at 25 μM (Figure S2 of the ), indicating the values at 25 μM Aβ43 faithfully represent
those of the free Aβ43 monomer.

Diagram of the NMR experiments conducted,
the phenomena probed
by these experiments, and a summary of the results.

Dynamics of the backbone of monomeric Aβ42 and Aβ43
as measured by (a) 15N R2,
(b) 15N R1, and (c) heteronuclear 15N–{1H} nuclear Overhauser effect (hetNOE)
values. Dynamical differences on the picosecond to nanosecond time
scale are observed for the central (R2) and C-terminal regions (R2, R1, and hetNOE) of Aβ43. Error bars denote
one standard deviation. Hydrophobic residues appear in green. 

Furthermore, significantly higher
values of the heteronuclear NOE,
associated with slower motions, are observed at positions 34, 35,
41, and 42 in Aβ43 (Figure c). In addition, R1 is significantly higher from residue 38 through
the C-terminus in Aβ43 (Figure b) just
as was previously observed in the more rigid C-terminus of Aβ42
compared to that of Aβ40. A higher 15N R1 is expected for slower motions
under these conditions and field because of the contribution of &lt;1
ns time scale motion to backbone relaxation in a disordered peptide. Together, 15N backbone dynamics experiments
confirm that dynamical differences, specifically slower motions, across
the picosecond to nanosecond time scale are present in the C-terminal
hydrophobic region of Aβ43 compared to that of Aβ42.

To determine whether the slower C-terminal motions observed for
Aβ43 are a result of an increased propensity of Aβ43 to
form stable structure or simply due to the higher molecular weight
of Aβ43, we compared the 15N R2 values in native buffer to those under denaturing conditions
[100 μM Aβ43 or Aβ42 in 7.2 M urea with the same
buffer used previously, 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.9)] where any stable or
transient secondary structure should be disrupted. Under denaturing
conditions, the difference between 15N R2 values for Aβ42 and Aβ43 is nearly completely
suppressed (Figure S3 of the ), suggesting that slower dynamics observed across the central and
C-terminal regions of Aβ43 under native conditions are due to
the formation of transient structure.

Structural Changes in the
C-Terminal Region of Monomeric Aβ
Induced by T43
To interrogate changes in structure that give
rise to the observed dynamical differences, we measured the chemical
shift differences between monomeric Aβ43 and Aβ42. Chemical
shifts are sensitive reporters of structure and structural changes
that are especially useful in systems such as Aβ43 where a low
sample concentration and a disordered structural ensemble preclude
characterization by traditional (1H–1H NOE-based) NMR structural methods. The differences between 1HN and 15N chemical shift deviations (Δδ) for Aβ43 and Aβ42
were measured under native conditions. Throughout the first 20 residues,
absolute 1HN and 15N chemical shift
differences were small, not exceeding 0.003 and 0.02 ppm (Figure ), respectively. However, large differences were
observed across the C-terminal region with 1HN and 15N Δδ values for residues I32 and G33
exceeding −0.04 ppm. Given the long sequence distance between
residues I32 and G33 and the Aβ43 C-terminus, the large Δδ
values for these residues are unlikely to result from a peptide conformation-independent
mechanism, suggesting that the Aβ43
C-terminal structural ensemble is distinct from that of Aβ42.
Further supporting this hypothesis that the chemical shift differences
between Aβ43 and Aβ42 are caused by differences in the
structural ensemble, C-terminal chemical shift differences between
Aβ43 and Aβ42 are preserved at 37 °C and are decreased
by a factor of approximately 2 under denaturing conditions (Figure
S4 of the ).

Chemical shift
differences between monomeric Aβ42 and Aβ43
span from residue 31 to the C-terminus. Differences in (a) proton, 1HN Δδ, and (b) nitrogen, 15N Δδ, chemical shifts between Aβ43 and Aβ42.
Large changes in chemical shifts for residue A42 in Aβ42 and
Aβ43 due to terminal effects are not shown.

To investigate if differences in local secondary structure
contribute
to the 1HN chemical shift differences observed
between Aβ43 and Aβ42, 3JHN-Hα coupling constants sensitive to backbone
ϕ angles were obtained by line-shape analysis of high-resolution 1H HSQC spectra. Our measured 3JHN-Hα couplings correlate extremely well
with previously reported 3JHN-Hα values for Aβ40 and Aβ42 (Figure S5 of the ) and are similar for Aβ40, Aβ42, and Aβ43 throughout
the majority of the peptide (residues E3–V39). However, 3JHN-Hα couplings
differ at the C-terminus of each peptide at both 10 °C (Figure ) and 37 °C (Figure S6 of the ). The near-maximal possible 3JHN-Hα value of T43 (8.9
Hz) demonstrates that the terminal residue of Aβ43 adopts a
ϕ angle near −120° far more often than the terminal
alanine of Aβ42 with a 3JHN-Hα value of 7.4 Hz. This difference is likely due to the increased
extended conformation propensity due to branching at Cβ. However, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 1Hα, and 1Hβ and chemical
shifts for the C-termini of Aβ42 and Aβ43 from natural
abundance 1H–13C HSQC spectra (Figure
S7 of the ) demonstrate
no significant shift differences in resolvable nonterminal residues
except a 0.2 ppm upfield Cα shift for I41, consistent with a
slightly lower helical or higher extended/coil propensity based on
refDB statistics for Ile. Taken together,
significant dynamical differences across the C-terminus and measurable
differences in 1HN and 15N chemical
shifts without hallmarks of the formation of stable secondary structure
(e.g., increased level of chemical shift dispersion and changes in
Cα and Cβ chemical shifts, large differences in 3JHN-Hα) suggest that addition
of T43 changes the population of transiently formed structure in the
C-terminal region of monomeric Aβ.

in Protofibril-Bound States of Aβ43
Because our previous
work demonstrated that the additional residues
in Aβ42 led to motions in the protofibril-bound state slower
than those of Aβ40, we used the same combination of 15N ΔR2 and DEST NMR to determine
if the additional threonine in Aβ43 also demonstrated slowed
C-terminal dynamics in the protofibril-bound state. By measurement
of the difference between transverse relaxation rates, 15N ΔR2, in the presence of Aβ43
protofibrils (high concentration, 120 μM) and in a low-concentration
reference sample without protofibrils (25 μM), a residue-by-residue
picture of the interactions stabilizing binding of Aβ43 to protofibrils
begins to emerge. In-phase 15N R2 values for 25 μM Aβ43 range from 1.60 ± 0.03 to
5.6 ± 0.2 s–1, representing those expected
for a peptide of this size under these conditions. For samples of
120 μM total Aβ43, where approximately 10% of the peptide
remains monomeric, R2 values are consistently
higher, from 2.8 ± 0.1 to 8.0 ± 0.6 s–1. It is important to note that the smooth variation in ΔR2 from position to position observed here (Figure a) and the external field and nucleus (15N vs 1HN) independence we described previously
for Aβ40 and Aβ42 under these conditions indicate that
ΔR2 does not arise from intermediate
time scale chemical exchange broadening, but rather a lifetime broadening
effect due to binding of the NMR visible monomer to the very high-molecular
weight (&gt;2 MDa) protofibril where transverse 15N magnetization
relaxes rapidly (faster than the rate of unbinding). In the case of Aβ43, the maximal ΔR2 of 2.9 ± 0.2 s–1 (Figure a) represents instead the apparent first-order association
rate constant (konapp) for binding. This finding is similar to
the previously reported values for Aβ40 (3.0 ± 0.2 s–1) at 270 μM and Aβ42 (2.4 ± 0.2 s–1) at 150 μM.

Protofibril-bound
state of Aβ43 probed at atomic resolution
by 15N ΔR2 and dark-state
exchange saturation transfer (DEST) NMR spectroscopy. (a) The enhancements
in 15N transverse relaxation rates [15N ΔR2 (○)] of 120 μM Aβ43 compared
to those of 25 μM samples arise due to interactions of the NMR
visible monomeric peptide with the protofibrils. The best-fit 15N ΔR2 is illustrated with
the solid black line. (b–e) 15N DEST experiments.

offsets from 6 to −6 kHz were used to saturate the protofibrillar
dark state with single-residue specificity, shown for residues E3,
L17, A30, and T43. Lines indicate the calculated saturation profiles
using the best-fit parameters for a 15N spin in a model
incorporating both tethered and direct contact states. Error bars
denote the standard deviation.

Residue-by-residue behavior in the protofibril-bound state
in exchange
with the population of monomers of Aβ43 can be probed directly
using DEST NMR. The experiment can be summarized as follows. Longitudinal 15N magnetization prepared in the DEST experiment is efficiently
saturated by weak, off-resonance, continuous wave pulses only in the
slowly tumbling protofibrils; the monomer is largely unaffected. This
saturation is then transferred to the pool of monomers when peptides
unbind from the aggregates. The subsequent attenuation of the monomeric
Aβ43 resonances is residue-specific (Figure b–e). The attenuation varies on the basis of the conformation
and motions in the protofibrillar state, with greater attenuation
observed for slower moving regions, revealing structural and dynamic
details of the protofibril-bound state.

An atomically detailed
model of the dynamic binding of Aβ
peptides to protofibrils can be created by combining the results of
DEST NMR and ΔR2 experiments, as
we have recently demonstrated for Aβ40 and Aβ42. As was the case for Aβ40 and Aβ42,
a two-state model with a single protofibril-bound state, where each
residue has a unique fit parameter for R2 in the bound state, cannot fit all the data simultaneously. However,
the DEST and ΔR2 data are consistent
with a simple modification to the two-state model where each residue
in the protofibril-bound state can be in direct contact with the aggregate
surface or tethered to the surface by the binding of residues further
down the chain (Figure a). In this model,
each residue experiences the same transverse relaxation rate when
in direct contact with the surface, R2contact, reflecting
the common, slow motions of the protofibril, and two residue-specific
properties: the ratio of the time spent in direct-contact states versus
states tethered to the surface via the direct interactions of other
residues in the same chain, K3, and the
average transverse relaxation rate when tethered, 15N R2tethered. This model adds the fewest number of parameters to a two-state
model that allows a good fit to the experimental data. The first-order rate constant describing the
binding of the monomer to the protofibril, konapp, is set to
3 s–1, the maximal value of ΔR2. Because the low equilibrium monomer concentration (12
μM) and accompanying low signal-to-noise ratio limited the number
of high-quality data points that can be measured in a 5 day DEST experiment
compared to that previously measured for Aβ40 and Aβ42,
the global kinetic parameters relating the binding and unbinding of
Aβ from the protofibrils at equilibrium could not be uniquely
determined from the DEST and ΔR2 data. R2contact is consistent with a single, residue-independent
value ranging from 10000 to 30000 s–1 and was set
to 19000 s–1 to match the values previously determined
for Aβ40 and Aβ42. The population
of transiently protofibril-bound monomer, pB, is consistent with values from 2 to 10%. Choosing a value of 4%,
the same as that for Aβ42 and similar to that for Aβ40
(6%), in combination with an R2contact of 19000 s–1 results in N-terminal values of residue-specific R2tethered similar
to those for both Aβ40 and Aβ42, and hence this choice
was made for further analysis. Although the values of R2contact and pB affect the quantitative values of the residue-specific
parameters, the interpretation of the data is independent of the chosen
values (see Figure S8 of the ).

Binding model and local parameters describing Aβ43 monomer–protofibril
interactions. (a) The dynamic binding of Aβ43 to protofibrils
can be described by a model incorporating two different ensembles
of states for each residue: in direct contact with the surface or
tethered via the binding of other residues. (b) Residue-specific equilibrium
constant (K3) values for Aβ40 (blue),
Aβ42 (red), and Aβ43 (black) describing the relative ratio
of direct contact and tethered states for each residue. (c) Residue-specific 15N R2tethered values for Aβ40 (blue), Aβ42
(red), and Aβ43 (black) describing the average structure and
motions of each residue when it is tethered to protofibrils by the
binding of other residues in the same chain. Error bars denote the
standard deviation. Values presented for Aβ40 and Aβ42
were taken from ref ().

The simple extension to the two-state
model captures an atomic
level picture of the dynamic ensemble of protofibril-bound structures
in two residue-specific parameters, K3 and R2tethered. K3, measuring the ratio
of direct contact to tethered states at any given residue, for Aβ43
is highest across residues 17–21 and residues 30–36
(Figure b), which comprise the central and
C-terminal hydrophobic regions of the peptide, respectively, indicating
that these residues are most likely to bind directly to the protofibril
surface. In contrast, lower values of K3 are found at the hydrophilic regions at the N-terminus and the region
connecting the hydrophobic patches. This pattern is similar to that
found for Aβ40 and Aβ42. The average value of K3 for Aβ43 for the fit parameters described
above is lower than that of Aβ42, which is lower than that of
Aβ40. This inverse dependence on Aβ length is likely a
result of an increasing level of competition between additional protofibril-binding
sites on the Aβ peptide with an increasing length. Unlike both
Aβ42 and Aβ40 where the value of K3 falls at the C-terminus, the value of K3 rises at T43, indicating that the terminal threonine of Aβ43
plays a role in directly mediating contact with protofibrillar aggregates.

The residue-specific values of R2tethered provide a quantitative
measure of the average motions of each residue of Aβ43 when
it is tethered to the protofibril surface (Figure c). Larger values of R2tethered correspond to slower motions,
most likely due to shorter tethering lengths. As previously observed
for Aβ40 and Aβ42, R2tethered values for Aβ43
are lowest in the hydrophilic N-terminal region, suggesting they are
most often far from the aggregate surface when other residues mediate
direct interaction. R2tethered values are higher in hydrophobic
regions and closely match those of Aβ42, showing significantly
slower motions than Aβ40 in the C-terminal hydrophobic region.
Taken together, these data suggest protofibril-bound states of Aβ43
are structurally and dynamically more similar to those of Aβ42
than those of Aβ40, with additional interactions in the protofibril-bound
state mediated directly by T43.

Discussion
Recent
evidence points to the potential of Aβ peptides other
than the most common Aβ40 and Aβ42 to seed toxic aggregates
in AD. Among these low-population species,
Aβ43 is of particular interest because its aggregation is a
hallmark of sporadic AD, the most common
form of AD, whose molecular origins are currently unknown.

Here,
we characterized the changes in the aggregation and structural
properties of the Aβ peptide introduced by the addition of a
single C-terminal threonine residue to form Aβ43. This terminal
extension alters the structure and dynamics of both the monomeric
state and the resulting protofibrillar aggregates. In the monomeric
state, slower motions that cannot be explained simply by a longer
peptide are evident across the C-terminus of Aβ43 relative to
Aβ42 (Figure ), supporting the hypothesis
of Wang and co-workers that slower motions in the monomeric state
of Aβ are correlated with a higher aggregation propensity. These dynamical differences are accompanied
by differences in chemical shifts (Figure  and Figure S7 of the ), suggesting that slower motions in Aβ43 can be attributed
to a distinct structural ensemble compared to that of Aβ42.
Although the structural ensemble is difficult to determine directly
because of the extremely low equilibrium concentration (12 μM),
Aβ43 chemical shifts are consistent with a highly disordered
protein as is observed for Aβ40 and Aβ42,, though small chemical shift differences across the C-terminus likely
arise from changes in transiently populated structures (e.g., hydrogen-bonded
turns). Differences in the monomeric state are mirrored in the aggregation
of Aβ43, which more rapidly forms protofibrils and has a critical
aggregation concentration much lower than those of Aβ42 and
Aβ40 (Figure ). In the protofibril-bound
state, the slow dynamics of the C-terminal residues when they are
tethered and the partitioning into tethered and directly bound states
of Aβ43 more closely resemble those of Aβ42 than those
of Aβ40, demonstrating a correlation between the aggregation
behavior and the dynamics in the protofibril-bound state. In addition,
the C-terminus of Aβ43 is involved in direct contact with the
aggregates more often than the adjacent residues, unlike at the termini
of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Stabilizing contacts between the C-terminal
ends of Aβ peptides at the core of transient oligomeric aggregates
are critical for overcoming the critical nucleus for formation of
partially ordered stable aggregates including protofibrils. Hence, the direct contacts formed by the C-terminal
threonine may provide an explanation for the protofibril formation
of Aβ43 being much more rapid than that of Aβ42. In summary,
these results support the hypothesis that small but significant differences
in the monomeric and protofibrillar structure and dynamics of Aβ43
result in an increased aggregation propensity, providing an explanation
for the observed enhanced toxicity of Aβ43 and a possible mechanism
for its suspected role in sporadic AD.

The correlation between
C-terminal Aβ length and aggregation
propensity has been studied extensively, primarily comparing the most
common species, Aβ40 and Aβ42. Lansbury and co-workers
demonstrated that C-terminal fragments of long Aβ species, Aβ26–42
and Aβ26–43, showed aggregation much more rapid than
that of Aβ26–40 but could not resolve a difference between
these species. Similarly, Vandersteen
et al. demonstrate that Aβ43 and Aβ42 both aggregate rapidly,
without a distinct lag phase in fibril formation monitored by thioflavin
T fluorescence, but could not quantitatively distinguish the aggregation
rates of Aβ42 from Aβ43. We
have shown that Aβ43 does dramatically increase the rate and
extent of protofibril aggregation relative to those of Aβ42.
Our results demonstrate that this higher aggregation propensity is
associated with slower motions in both the monomeric and protofibril-bound
states. Furthermore, our data attribute this difference in dynamics
to small but critical structural changes in the C-terminal structural
ensemble, similar to the significant structural differences observed
for Aβ42 due to the two additional residues present relative
to Aβ40. Although our results probe
the structure, motions, and aggregation of Aβ43 at atomic resolution,
future studies using molecular simulation may shed light on the specific
contacts stabilized by T43 in the monomeric and protofibril-bound
state that are difficult to exhaustively characterize using experiments
alone. The differences between the chemical shifts, R2, and DEST parameters of Aβ43 relative to those
of Aβ42 reported here will serve as important residue-specific
observables for direct validation of both the structure and dynamics
of simulated ensembles, as we have previously demonstrated for shorter
Aβ peptides.,

Although high-resolution
NMR experiments offer the ability to study
the structure and aggregation of Aβ peptides with atomistic
precision, the conditions used here are entirely in vitro under a single set of conditions, and the behavior under other conditions
as well as in vivo may be different. One important
difference between these experimental conditions commonly used for in vitro studies and the native environment is the concentration
of Aβ; while we used concentrations of &gt;10 μM, Aβ
peptides are typically present at concentrations of ∼25 nM.
However, the native environment is not homogeneous, and recent work
suggests that aggregation is initiated within endosomes that concentrate
Aβ to the micromolar range, leading to subsequent seeding of
extracellular amyloid formation. Hence,
the concentrations used for this work potentially correspond to the
effective conditions in vivo; the critical concentration
in the low micromolar range and more rapid aggregation of Aβ43,
compared to that of Aβ42, lead us to hypothesize that Aβ43
is able to nucleate toxic aggregates in endocytic compartments much
more frequently than shorter Aβ species. Therefore, we propose
a model in which Aβ43 aggregates either with itself or with
other highly aggregation-prone Aβ variants to seed subsequent
Aβ42 aggregation. The biochemical changes that lead to even
a small increase in the level of production of Aβ43, because
of impaired γ-secretase activity along the pathway to form Aβ40,
may be a critical trigger for AD. Additionally, therapeutic strategies
attempting to clear Aβ using either active (Aβ immunization)
or passive (administration of Aβ-binding antibodies) targeting
specifically Aβ43 should be investigated. For example, in the
mouse model of Saito et al. where Aβ43 is overproduced because
of a mutation, the ability of an Aβ43-specific immunotherapy
to prevent both plaque formation and the observed neurological deficits
could be tested. Further experiments to test the hypothesis that Aβ43
recruits Aβ42 aggregation in vitro by determining
the aggregation rates and atomic resolution mechanism of co-aggregation
in mixtures of Aβ peptides containing Aβ43 are ongoing
in the laboratory.
