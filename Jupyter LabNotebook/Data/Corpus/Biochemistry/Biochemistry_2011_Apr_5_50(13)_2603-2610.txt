Autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism (ARJP) is an early onset familial form of Parkinson’s disease. The distinguishing features of ARJP from the more prevalent idiopathic form of the disease include its earlier onset age, slower disease course, occasional dystonia, and long-lasting response to low doses of l-dopa. ARJP is thought to result from mutations in one or more genes, including the gene that encodes the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin,() accounting for approximately 50% of all cases. Parkin, as with all E3 ligases, is an important enzyme in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. It has been shown to covalently link ubiquitin to potential substrates such as Eps15,, CDCrel-1,() α-synuclein,() synphilin-1,() AIMP2,() and FBP-1.() However, confirmation of some of these substrates and their functional outcomes remains controversial., More recently, parkin has been shown to have an important role in mitochondrial function. Parkin ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins serves to recruit and assemble the autophagy machinery to clear impaired mitochondria.() Interestingly, the activity of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is decreased in the substantia nigra and other tissues in Parkinson’s disease patients. Further, several complex I inhibitors reproduce key features of Parkinson’s disease such as loss of dopaminergic neurons and motor deficits.,

Parkin is a multidomain E3 ubiquitin ligase consisting of 465 amino acids with five distinct domains: an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain followed by a unique parkin-specific domain (UPD), a RING0 domain, and two C-terminal RING domains separated by an in-between RING (IBR) domain.() The N-terminal Ubl domain has been shown to be essential for the ligase activity of parkin since deletion or mutation of this domain results in impaired E3 ligase activity., The Ubl domain has also been shown to participate in a variety of protein interactions. For example, binding of the Ubl domain to the S5a proteasomal subunit has been suggested to position parkin and its bound substrates near the degradation machinery.() Alternatively, the parkin Ubl domain has been shown to interact with the endocytotic protein, Eps15,,, in order to facilitate Eps15 ubiquitination used in the Akt signaling cascade.

Early onset PD has been linked to homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in the parkin gene. However, heterozygous mutations in parkin also exist and are more controversial() including some that are likely polymorphisms. Approximately 95 nonstop, missense mutations are associated with ARJP (see http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/PDmutDB and http://www.hgmd.org) and are located throughout the parkin gene resulting in single residue substitutions in the coded protein (for a summary see refs () and ()). This includes at least 20 substitutions at 16 different positions in the Ubl domain. Some disease state mutations localized to the Ubl domain have been shown to decrease the stability of the full-length parkin protein in vivo, although conflicting evidence has been presented for the effects of the mutations on E3 ligase activity.,, To date, it has been difficult to distinguish whether the observations arise from substitutions causing structural or folding alterations in parkin or are a result of disrupted protein interactions with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, potential substrates, or the S5a proteasomal subunit. One reason for this uncertainty has been the inability to purify parkin, its constitutive domains, and especially proteins containing disease-causing mutations on a large scale suitable for biophysical studies. To date, only the parkin Ubl, and IBR() domains have been purified and their three-dimensional structures determined. While some mutant forms of the parkin IBR domain have been isolated and characterized,() similar approaches have not been completed for the Ubl domain mutant containing proteins. To date, only two substitutions (K48A, R42P) have been structurally examined in the Ubl domain leaving the majority of the disease-related substitutions uncharacterized., Further, while a large number of mutations in the RING domains have been examined for interactions with different E2 enzymes () and ubiquitination,,− similar comprehensive studies have not been completed for the Ubl domain.

In this work we have examined proteins carrying ARJP disease-associated mutations at 13 of the possible 16 positions in the parkin Ubl domain in order to identify the impact of these substitutions on the Ubl domain structure, stability, and interactions with the S5a proteasome. Our work provides evidence that several ARJP disease state mutations cause drastic alterations in the Ubl domain structure and/or stability, while others disrupt binding to the S5a proteasomal subunit. These observations provide two different mechanisms that ARJP-associated missense mutations in the parkin gene may contribute to the dysfunction of the protein in the ubiquitination pathway.

Experimental Procedures
Cloning
The DNA fragment encoding the Ubl domain (residues 1−77) of human parkin was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET44a vector (Novagen). The substitutions G12R, V15M, D18N, A31D, K32T, R33Q, Q34R, P37L, R42P, A46P, K48A, T55I, and V56E in the Ubl domain were created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The DNA fragment encoding the UIMs (residues 196−309) of the human proteasomal S5a subunit was cloned into a pET21a vector (Novagen) modified to include a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site before the six-residue histidine C-terminal tag. For expression with an in-frame N-terminal GB1 fusion, the DNA fragment encoding the Ubl domain (1−77) was cloned into the NheI and XhoI sites of the GEV1 vector,() a generous gift from Dr. M. Clore (NIDDK, Bethesda, MD). The V56E substituted version of the GB1-Ubl domain fusion was created using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit.

Protein Expression and Purification
The Ubl domain, GB1-Ubl domain, and all substituted proteins were overexpressed in the BL21(DE3) Codon PlusRIL Escherichia coli strain and purified as previously described using the same chromatographic methods.() The S5a196−309 fragment containing both UIM regions was expressed with a six-residue histidine tag and purified using a Ni-NTA FPLC affinity column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion chromatography. Ubiquitin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was expressed from a pET3a vector as previously described.() The integrity of all proteins was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UWO Biological Mass Spectrometry Laboratory).

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed on a 600 MHz Varian Inova spectrometer equipped with either a 13C-enhanced triple resonance cold probe with z-gradients or an xyz gradient, triple resonance probe (Biomolecular NMR Facility, UWO). 1H chemical shifts were referenced directly to internal DSS at 0 ppm. Sensitivity-enhanced 1H−15N HSQC spectra() were recorded at 25 °C on 15N-labeled proteins in 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 30 μM DSS, and 10% D2O at pH 7.0. All spectra were processed with NMRPipe() software using a 60° shifted, cosine-squared function in both 1H and 15N dimensions and analyzed using NMRView.()

Protein Unfolding Experiments
Unfolding experiments were monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry using a Jasco J-810 instrument (Biomolecular Interactions and Conformations Facility, UWO). Spectra (190−250 nm) were initially measured at 5 °C using ten averaged scans for protein samples ranging in concentration from 20 to 80 μM in a 1 mm cell. Following this, the ellipticity at 222 nm was measured as a function of temperature between 5 and 95 °C using a 1 °C/min temperature gradient. Data were analyzed by plotting the observed ellipticity as a function of temperature and fitting for the melting point transition (Tm) and the enthalpy (ΔHm) according to eq . During the fitting process a heat capacity (ΔCp) of 3.1 kJ/(mol K) was used based on calculated accessible surface areas of the folded and unfolded Ubl domain., The data were found to be insensitive to heat capacity as fits done using ΔCp 0 kJ/(mol K) yielded near identical values for Tm and ΔHm.

The differences in stability (ΔΔG) between substituted Ubl domain proteins and the wild-type protein were calculated using ΔHm(wt), Tm(wt), and the differences in melting temperatures (ΔTm) between the wild type and the appropriate substituted proteins() according to eq .

Ubl Domain−S5a Binding Assays
Purified His-tagged S5a196−309 was mixed with untagged Ubl domain, substituted Ubl domain proteins, or ubiquitin at a 1:2 molar ratio, respectively, in a total volume of 300 μL and placed on a rotating shaker at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixture was then loaded onto a Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen) preequilibrated in binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8). The column was washed twice with 600 μL of binding buffer and then eluted (20 mM sodium phosphate, 250 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8). Elution samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on a tricine−polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue dye. Protein concentrations were determined using the extinction coefficient method measured in guanidine hydrochloride.()

Results
The three-dimensional structure of the parkin Ubl domain comprises a β-grasp fold (Figure ) containing a five-strand β-sheet (β1, H11−V15; β2, I2−F7; β3, R42−F45; β4, K48−L50; and β5, Q64−V70) and two α-helices (α1, S22-Q34; α2, V56-D60).() This structure is characteristic of other ubiquitin-like domains such as hPLIC-2 and hHR23a, and ubiquitin.() Despite these structural similarities, the parkin Ubl domain is nearly 11 kJ/mol less stable than ubiquitin.() The lower stability of the parkin Ubl domain may be an inherent property of the domain or might indicate that intramolecular interactions with other domains in the protein are needed to enhance its stability. Therefore, missense mutations in the Ubl domain could contribute to its improper folding, instability that would interfere with the overall structure of parkin or compromise its interactions with other proteins. To determine the effects of ARJP mutations on the structure and stability of the parkin Ubl domain, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create 13 of the possible substituted proteins. NMR spectroscopy was used to assess how each of these single residue substitutions might affect the overall structure of the proteins. Thermal denaturation, as measured by CD spectropolarimetry, was used to identify the change in stability caused by the substitutions. Both of these methods were used to determine whether structural alterations might render the Ubl domain ineffective for interaction with the proteasomal S5a subunit. The substitutions investigated covered most secondary structure regions of the Ubl domain including G12R (UbldG12R) and V15 M (UbldV15M) in β1; R42P (UbldR42P) in β3; K48A (UbldK48A) in β4; A31D (UbldA31D), K32T (UbldK32T), R33Q (UbldR33Q), and Q34R (UbldQ34R) in β1; V56E (UbldV56E) in β2; and D18N (UbldD18N), P37L (UbldP37L), A46P (UbldA46P), and T55I (UbldT55I) in loop regions (Figure ). The ARJP substitution UbldR42P () and another reported,() but not confirmed (UbldK48A), have been previously described() and are included here for completeness. The proteins covered 13 of the 16 sites for ARJP mutations. The only substitutions not assessed were at the initiating methionine position (M1L) and S10N and W54R that were reported after this work was started.

This figure was produced using the program PyMOL() using the human parkin Ubl domain structure (Protein Data Bank 1IYF).()

Most Ubl domain substituted proteins with the exception of UbldA31D, UbldR42P, UbldA46P, and UbldV56E expressed well and produced yields comparable to that of the wild-type protein. The UbldA31D protein expressed at very low levels, could not be purified to homogeneity, and was not further investigated in these studies. The UbldA46P and UbldV56E proteins were expressed, but more than 90% of the protein was found in the insoluble fraction of the cell lysate as determined from Coomassie stained gels (data not shown). Attempts to purify these proteins showed wide variations in heterogeneity and susceptibility to proteolysis as determined by mass spectrometry. The UbldT55I protein was expressed and could be purified intact, but preliminary NMR spectra showed a heterogeneous population of peaks with different line widths. The behaviors of UbldA31D, UbldA46P, UbldT55I, and UbldV56E are consistent with poorly folded protein structures that are sensitive to degradation and/or aggregation, similar to that observed for UbldR42P. To circumvent this issue, we selected a candidate protein (UbldV56E) to express as a fusion protein linked to the B1 domain from immunoglobulin G (GB1), similar to that described previously for UbldR42P.() The resulting protein GB1-UbldV56E could be expressed to high levels and purified to homogeneity for structural characterization.

Parkin R42P, A46P, and V56E Substitutions Cause Ubl Domain Unfolding
CD spectropolarimetry and NMR spectroscopy were used to determine whether any significant changes to the secondary and tertiary structures of the substituted proteins occurred compared to the wild-type Ubl domain. The CD spectrum of the wild-type Ubl domain at 5 °C had well-defined minima near 208 and 225 nm (Figure ) consistent with its three-dimensional structure, which contains approximately 21% α-helix and 43% β-sheet. A comparison of the CD spectra for UbldP37L (Figure ) and several other substituted proteins (UbldG12R, UbldV15M, UbldD18N, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, UbldQ34R, UbldK48A) with the wild-type Ubl domain showed less than 5% difference between the spectra, indicating that the secondary structure of these Ubl domain proteins was very similar to the normal protein at this temperature. A CD spectrum of UbldA46P (Figure ) showed very poor signal from α-helix or β-sheet structure indicating this protein was likely unfolded. Analysis of this sample using mass spectrometry subsequent to CD measurement revealed that a portion of the protein had undergone proteolysis.

Folding comparison of substituted Ubl domains using CD spectropolarimetry. The spectrum of the wild-type parkin Ubl domain is shown (−) compared to the UbldP37L protein (- - -) that maintained a similar fold. The spectrum of the UbldA46P protein (···) which had little secondary structure and was shown by mass spectrometry to be sensitive to proteolysis is also shown. All spectra were collected using 20−80 μM protein in 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0 at 5 °C.

Each of the Ubl domain substituted proteins was examined by comparing their 1H−15N HSQC spectrum with the wild-type parkin Ubl domain spectrum (Figure ). It was expected that a benign single site substitution should have only local effects on the spectrum reflecting the amino acid change whereas a greater disruption in structure would be reflected in a large number of spectral changes, especially for residues remote from the substitution. The 1H−15N HSQC spectra for the UbldG12R, UbldV15M, UbldD18N, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, UbldQ34R, UbldP37L, and UbldK48A proteins (Figure  and Figure S1 of ) all had well-dispersed peaks and similar spectral patterns to the wild-type Ubl domain spectrum. In several cases (UbldD18N, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, UbldP37L, and UbldK48A) the single amino acid substitutions resulted in minimal changes in the NMR spectrum. For example, in the UbldK32T protein (Figure A) the appearance of a new peak for T32 and a large shift of the neighboring R33 occurred while the remainder of the spectrum was unaffected. This is consistent with a minor environmental change around position 32 with little alteration in structure. In contrast, the 1H−15N HSQC spectrum for UbldV15M resulted in changes in chemical shift to the adjacent residues E16, V17, and D18 but also to V29 and V30 in the α1 helix and several residues (F4, V5, F7) in β2. In the Ubl domain structure, V15 packs against V29 and V30 and has backbone contacts with M1−V3 near the N-terminus, indicating the V15M substitution likely affected the packing between these residues. A similar observation was noted for the Q34R substitution.

Superposition of spectra for the parkin Ubl domain (black) with (A) UbldK32T (red) and (B) UbldV15M (red). In each panel selected residue assignments are shown that have the largest chemical shift differences from the wild-type Ubl domain. An arrow is used to indicate the positions of peaks for the substituted residue in the wild-type and substituted proteins.

Since the UbldV56E protein could not be purified in sufficient levels and was susceptible to proteolysis, the protein was linked to the B1 domain from immunoglobulin G (GB1; GB1-UbldV56E) to improve these properties. The resulting 1H−15N HSQC spectrum (Figure ) displayed a population of well-dispersed peaks that were in excellent agreement with those observed in the 1H−15N HSQC spectrum of the isolated GB1 domain.() This indicated that the GB1 domain maintained its native fold having little interaction with the UbldV56E portion of the construct. The remaining peaks arising from the UbldV56E protein had little resemblance to the 1H−15N HSQC spectrum of the wild-type Ubl domain or most of the substituted proteins (Figure ). The nondisperse nature of these peaks and their tight clustering between 8.0 and 8.5 ppm in the 1H dimension indicated the UbldV56E protein was unfolded. Subsequent to the NMR experiments, size exclusion chromatography showed the elution volume of GB1-UbldV56E was much smaller than expected for a 16 kDa protein, consistent with its unfolded structure. A similar observation has been made previously for UbldR42P.() Overall, these results indicate that the Ubl domain proteins containing the ARJP mutations G12R, D18N, K32T, R33Q, P37L, and K48A retain a similar three-dimensional fold as the wild-type domain, while at least two others (UbldV15M, UbldQ34R) have evidence of altered packing. In contrast, three substitutions (R42P, A46P, and V56E) result in gross structural differences due to unfolding of the domain.

The spectrum of the GB1-UbldV56E protein is plotted in black contours while the isolated GB1 protein is shown in red contours. The spectra were collected at 600 MHz in 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0 at 25 °C.

Folded ARJP Substituted Proteins Lead to Differential Ubl Domain Stability
The substituted proteins (UbldG12R, UbldV15M, UbldD18N, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, UbldQ34R, UbldP37L, UbldK48A) that exhibited a folded structure were examined to determine if the substitutions had altered the stabilities of the proteins. This was done using thermal unfolding of each protein and monitoring the change in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. Initial spectra were recorded at 5 °C where the CD spectra of the selected substituted proteins were similar to the wild-type protein (Figure ). Most of the melting curves for native parkin Ubl domain and the ARJP substituted proteins showed smooth sigmoidal transitions between folded and unfolded species indicative of a two-state unfolding process (Figure ). UbldD18N and UbldK32T had shallower slopes that might indicate some deviation from this model. The data were fit using eq  to determine the midpoint of the transition (Tm) and the enthalpy (ΔHm). The data showed that the parkin Ubl domain had a melting temperature (Tm) near 63 °C (Table ). There were three ARJP-substituted proteins that melted at higher temperatures (UbldG12R, UbldD18N, UbldP37L) and five substituted Ubl domain proteins that unfolded at lower temperatures including UbldR33Q and UbldK48A that melted nearly 10 °C lower than the wild-type protein. The difference in stabilities was calculated using the method of Becktel and Schellman using the ΔHm for the wild type and the Tm for each protein.() These results generally followed the order of the melting stabilities indicating that UbldD18N was the most stable protein and UbldK48A had the poorest stability.

Thermal unfolding curves for the parkin Ubl domain and substituted proteins resulting from ARJP disease state mutations. Data were collected using CD spectropolarimetry between 5 and 95 °C using a 1 °C/min temperature gradient. The ellipticity at 222 nm was plotted as fraction unfolded and fit according to equations described in . All samples were comprised of 20−80 μM protein in 10 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT, pH 7.0.

ARJP-Substituted Proteins Compromise S5a Interaction
The interaction of the parkin Ubl domain with the 19S regulatory subunit S5a was studied using residues 196−309 of the 377 amino acid protein. This fragment (S5a196−309) could be expressed and purified with a six-residue histidine tag and possesses ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIMs) shown previously to interact with the parkin Ubl domain.() To assess the impact of different ARJP substitutions on the interaction of the Ubl domain with S5a196−309, affinity pull-down experiments were employed. Figure  shows that His-tagged S5a196−309 bound to Ni-NTA beads successfully pulled down untagged parkin Ubl domain. The S5a fragment also bound similarly to UbldG12R, UbldD18N, and UbldQ34R, indicating these substitutions are not involved at the parkin Ubl domain−S5a interface. However, S5a196−309 interactions with the parkin- substituted proteins UbldV15M, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, and UbldP37L were notably weaker than wild-type Ubl domain, similar to previous observations with the UbldK48A protein.() Since NMR experiments show some of these proteins (UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, and UbldP37L) retain a similar three-dimensional fold as the parkin Ubl domain, this indicates the substitutions likely interfere with formation of a proper parkin Ubl domain−S5a interface. As expected, little or no interaction between S5a196−309 and ubiquitin was observed.

ARJP substitutions in the Ubl domain disrupt S5a interactions. His6-S5a196−309 was incubated with 2 molar equiv of the parkin Ubl domain, substituted protein, or ubiquitin for 1 h and then loaded onto a Ni-NTA spin column. Following elution the samples were fractionated on a 16.5% tricine gel and stained with Coomassie dye. The top panel shows the bound proteins eluted with His6-S5a196−309 as follows: UbldG12R (lane 1), UbldV15M (lane 2), UbldD18N (lane 3), UbldR33Q (lane 4), UbldQ34R (lane 5), UbldP37L (lane 6), UbldK48A (lane 7), Ubl domain (lane 8), ubiquitin (lane 9), and His6-S5a196−309 alone (lane 13). Lower quantities of UbldK32T (lane 11) were used in the assay (although at the same molar ratio as the other mutants) so parkin Ubl domain was assayed again at this concentration (lane 12). Molecular weight markers are shown in lane 10. The lower panel illustrates the pure proteins as used in the pull-down assay and correspond to the same labels.

Discussion
Of the 13 substituted proteins we examined, five of them (UbldA31D, UbldR42P, UbldA46P, UbldT55I, and UbldV56E) showed significant structural alterations. For the UbldA31D protein, its low level of expression in bacteria compared to wild type is evidence for a poorly folded protein with decreased stability that may be subject to proteolysis. Similarly, UbldA46P showed little secondary or tertiary structure and was easily degraded. The UbldT55I protein showed evidence of heterogeneity and aggregation in NMR spectra. In previous studies we used an N-terminal GB1 tag to stabilize and protect the Ubl domain proteins from degradation. Both UbldV56E and UbldR42P had 1H−15N HSQC spectra consistent with an unfolded state for the Ubl domain portion of the protein. In the parkin Ubl domain, V56 is 95% buried near the N-terminus of the short α2 helix and participates in hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of M1, V17, and L61. Molecular dynamics experiments suggest that substitution of this hydrophobic residue with a charged glutamic acid residue would disrupt these interactions.() Similarly, A46 is located in the loop region between β3 and β4, and the substitution of alanine to proline would disrupt its hydrogen bonding to I66 in β5. Further, the addition of proline at this position could restrict the flexibility of the loop. As shown previously for UbldR42P, disruption of hydrogen bonding within the β-sheet regions can lead to unfolding of the entire domain.()

The eight proteins that contained substitutions but formed folded domains showed differential interactions with the tandem UIM region from the S5a subunit, proposed to allow for efficient delivery of polyubiquitinated cargo to the proteasome for degradation. The UbldK48A substitution resulted in decreased binding with S5a consistent with previous results showing this residue is involved in the interaction with the UIM region(s) from either S5a or Eps15.() In contrast, the UbldV15M, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q, and UbldP37L proteins showed diminished binding compared to wild-type Ubl domain even though none of these residues lies on the binding interface required for S5a interaction. Three of the substitutions (UbldV15M, UbldK32T, UbldR33Q) lead to decreased stability of the Ubl domain. It is noted that V15, K32, and R33 all interact with F13 in sheet β1, a residue affected by S5a binding. The decreased stability of the Ubl domain carrying these substitutions suggests that some modification of the S5a binding site has occurred. It is not clear why decreased S5a binding to the UbldP37L protein occurs as this substitution leads to increased domain stability. The similarity of S5a binding to UbldG12R and UbldD18N compared to wild-type Ubl domain was in agreement with their maintenance of three-dimensional fold and similar or increased stabilities. Although G12 is affected by the interaction with the UIMs from Eps15, neither substitution is at the interaction surface for S5a.()

The downstream effects of some interactions of the parkin Ubl domain have been validated in vitro and in vivo. It was recently shown that the interaction of the parkin Ubl domain with the regulatory particle of the proteasome activates the 26S proteasome.() This interaction provides a direct link between the cellular ubiquitination machinery and the regulation of the degradation machinery in the cell. The upregulation of proteasome activity was also shown in Drosophila where a K71P substitution (corresponding to R42P here) showed no regulation of proteasome activity, further indicating that a correctly folded Ubl domain is essential to the function of parkin in vivo.

Several ARJP substitutions in the Ubl domain shown to cause unfolding (UbldR42P, UbldV56E) or large decreases in stability (UbldR33Q, UbldK48A) alter the behavior of the full-length protein in vivo. In work done by Henn et al.() ARJP substitutions including R33Q, R42P, K48A, and V56E resulted in decreased stability of the full-length protein in N2a cells. This effect was shown to be a result of an increased degradation of parkin by the 26S proteasome. Another interaction where substitutions in the Ubl domain have been shown to affect its function is in the parkin interaction with the SH3 domain of endophilin-A1.() It was observed that in vitro parkin ubiquitinated endophilin-A1. The Ubl domain with the reported ARJP causative substitutions R42P and K48A was shown to disrupt this interaction, providing a new link between mutations in parkin and disruption to proteins in synaptic transmission.

These results clearly demonstrate there are multiple outcomes of the different ARJP disease-state mutations in the parkin Ubl domain. Some of these substitutions (A31D, R42P, A46P, T55I, V56E) result in disruption of the domain fold. Others, while maintaining the three-dimensional fold of the Ubl domain, have defects in interactions with the S5a subunit including K48A that has not been clearly linked to ARJP. Further, one must consider the outcomes of three of the substitutions (G12R, D18N, Q34R) that have little effect on the three-dimensional fold or S5a interaction. The corresponding mutations in the parkin gene are observed in the heterozygous state,− and could simply be a result of a polymorphism that has little impact on the protein function. Alternatively, it is possible that some of the disease-state residues in the parkin Ubl domain could be stabilized or are important for other essential, unidentified interactions with the remaining portions of the protein.  Further studies will be needed to clarify the roles of these residues in parkin function and in ARJP.
