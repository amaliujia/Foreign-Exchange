The anthrax
protective antigen
(PA) is the receptor binding component of the anthrax toxin, a complex
of proteins that mediates the pathogenicity of anthrax disease. After
binding to the receptor, PA undergoes proteolytic processing by a
furin-like protease, which cleaves off the N-terminal 167 amino acid
residues of PA within domain 1 (residues 1–258), termed PA20. PA20 subsequently
dissociates and leaves behind domain 1′ (residues 168–258)
and the three remaining domains, constituting a 63 kDa fragment (PA63). This fragment then oligomerizes into either a heptameric or octameric structure
termed the prepore. Binding of PA to the receptor hijacks the host
cell receptor to allow targeting of the other two components of the
anthrax toxin, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), to the host
cell surface. Once the prepore has formed, the toxin is internalized
by receptor-mediated endocytosis.

The structural details of
PA binding to the host cell receptor
capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2) are known, bound to either
the monomeric 83 kDa PA or the heptameric
prepore. Both structural and biochemical
studies of the PA–CMG2 complex indicate that the binding interface
is comprised of domain 4 and a small loop from domain 2 (2β3–2β4
loop), which inserts into a groove on the surface of CMG2 (Figure ).,− The binding
affinity between PA and CMG2 is very high (Kd ∼ 200 pM) and increases
at acidic pH. At the same time, receptor
binding has been shown to improve the stability of the heptameric
form of PA to pH and to facilitate the internalization of the toxin-bound
prepore., Our recent NMR study of PA labeled with
5-fluorotryptophan also suggested that receptor binding significantly
stabilizes PA to both pH and temperature.

Structure
of the PA–CMG2 complex (PDB entry 1T6B). Eight histidine
residues are shown (green sticks). Domain 1, Ser15–Ala258 (magenta);
domain 2, Tyr259–Thr487 (blue); domain 3, Thr488–Arg595
(pink); domain 4, Phe596–Ile734 (yellow); vWA domain of CMG2
(orange). All the histidine residues in PA except His304 and His310
are shown. His304 and His310 are not observed in the structure. The
2β3–2β4 loop of domain 2 is also indicated.

To further investigate the changes
in stability of PA upon CMG2
binding, we used a histidine hydrogen–deuterium exchange (His-HDX)
method, which monitors the slow rate
of HDX of the C2 hydrogen of the imidazole group of histidine,
and followed the rate of HDX as a function of increasing concentrations
of guanidinium hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl). Thus, using this method, we can measure the equilibrium unfolding
of specific histidine residues within the protein. There are 10 histidine
residues in PA that are scattered throughout the molecule, one in
the PA20 domain, two in domain 1′, five in domain
2, and two in domain 4. Herein, we show that receptor binding leads
to a significant shift in the concentration of Gdn-HCl required for
full HDX (unfolding) of histidines located in separate domains, suggesting
that receptor binding has a global effect on the thermodynamic stability
of the protein. These studies are corroborated using fluorescence,
in which we were able to probe selectively fluorescence changes in
PA using a 4-fluorotryptophan-labeled von Willebrand factor A (vWA)
domain of CMG2, which is nonfluorescent. His-HDX-MS also allowed us
to determine the pKa and more accurate
solvent accessibilities of the histidines in the presence and absence
of the receptor and reveal differences in the microenvironment around
the histidine residues as a consequence of receptor binding. Our results
indicate that receptor binding has a profound long-range impact on
the stability and structure of PA, suggesting that, with a limit on
hingelike motions between domain 2 and domain 4, the protein can be
made to be significantly more stable. Because PA is the major antigenic
component of the current anthrax vaccine, our studies would indicate
that addition of CMG2 to a vaccine formulation could improve the stability
and overall efficacy of the vaccine.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Deuterium oxide (D2O, 99%) was
purchased from Cambridge Isotope laboratories (Andover, MA), and guanidine
hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl), deuterium chloride (DCl), and sodium deuteroxide
(NaOD) were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Lys-C was purchased
from Wako Chemicals USA (Richmond, VA); chymotrypsin and thermolysin
were from Sigma-Aldrich, and Glu-C was from Worthington Biochemical
(Lakewood, NJ). All other chemicals and materials used were either
reagent grade or of the highest quality commercially available.

Protein Expression and Purification
PA and the vWA
domain of CMG2, encoding residues 38–218, were expressed and
purified as described previously.− Labeling of CMG2 with
4-fluorotryptophan was conducted using the tryptophan auxotroph DL41
(provided as a gift from the Yale E. coli Genetic
Stock Center). 4-Fluorotryptophan was purchased from Gold Biotechnology
(St. Louis, MO).

Unfolding Experiments Followed by His-HDX
PA alone
(0.5 nmol) and the PA–CMG2 complex (0.5 nmol of PA and 2.5
nmol of CMG2) were incubated in 100 μL of 100 mM HEPES (pH*
7.5) made with D2O containing 1 mM MgCl2 and
various concentrations of Gdn-HCl for 48 h at 37 °C. The pH*
of the buffer was adjusted with diluted NaOD with a Solution Analyzer
model 4603 instrument (Amber Science, Eugene, OR) equipped with a
glass AgCl electrode (model 476086, Nova Analytics, Woburn, MA). The
reported pH* values are direct pH meter readings of the D2O buffer solutions calibrated with standard buffer solutions made
with H2O and are uncorrected for the isotope effect at
the glass electrode. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL
of formic acid, and the protein was freed from the salts using an
Ultra Micro Spin C4 column (Nest Group, Southboro, MA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions and dried in a Speed Vac.

The protein was then redissolved in 60 μL of 100 mM ammonium
bicarbonate and digested by 2 μg of Lys-C for 30 min at 25 °C.
The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL of formic acid, and
the digest was divided into three parts and then dried in a Speed
Vac. Two parts were further digested, one part by 1 μg of Glu-C
for 30 min and other part by 1 μg of chymotrypsin for 30 min.
The resulting three digests were dried in a Speed Vac and redissolved
in 30 μL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The three digests
at particular Gdn-HCl concentrations were mixed and analyzed by liquid
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) using
a Qstar quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems-MDS
Sciex, Foster City, CA) equipped with a TurboIonSpray ion source.
The protein digests were injected into a reverse-phase C18 column
(500 mm × 0.1 mm, Waters); the peptides were chromatographed
using a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 2 to 50% in aqueous 0.1%
formic acid over a period of 40 min at a rate of 30 μL/min,
and the elute was directly introduced into the mass spectrometer.
The total ion current was obtained in the mass range of m/z 400–2000 in the positive ion mode with
an acquisition time of 1 s for each scan.

The pseudo-first-order
rate constant (k) of the
HDX reaction was determined by monitoring changes in the ratios of
the M + 1/M isotopic peak of a given peptide before (time zero) and
after (time t) the HDX reaction, and fitting the
data to a first-order rate equation, and
the values were corrected upward to offset the decreased solvent concentration
caused by the volume effect of Gdn-HCl. The relationship between solvent
concentration and Gdn-HCl concentration was experimentally determined,
from which the correction factor to correct the rate constant of the
HDX reaction in Gdn-HCl solutions was obtained (text and Figure S1
of the ). The corrected
HDX rate was plotted against the concentration of Gdn-HCl. From the
plot, the midpoint (Cm) of the Gdn-HCl-induced
unfolding transition was estimated by fitting the denaturation curve
to a two-state model. The free energy change (ΔG°) in PA denaturation was estimated from the plot by calculating
the equilibrium constant (Keq) of denature/native
protein at each Gdn-HCl concentration as follows.where k is the first-order
His-HDX rate constant at a specific Gdn-HCl concentration, kN is the k for the native protein
(k at 0 M Gdn-HCl), and kD is the k for the fully denatured protein (can be
obtained from the plateau of the sigmoidal curve). The Keq value was used to determine the free energy change
of denaturation at each Gdn-HCl concentration with the equationwhere R is the gas constant
and T is the absolute temperature in kelvin. By plotting
the ΔG° values against the concentrations
of Gdn-HCl and extrapolating the fitted line to 0 M Gdn-HCl, we obtained
ΔG°water in the absence of
Gdn-HCl.

Unfolding Experiments Followed by Fluorescence Spectroscopy
PA alone and PA (1 μmol) complexed with 4-fluorotryptophan-labeled
CMG2 (4-FTrpCMG2, 2 μmol) in 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) containing
1 mM MgCl2 and various concentrations of Gdn-HCl were placed
in a Cary-Eclipse fluorimeter, and the fluorescence emission spectra
were recorded at 20 °C by exciting the tryptophan residues in
PA at 295 nm and monitoring the emitted light at 334 nm. The data
were fit to a three-state transition in the absence of CMG2 as described
previously.

Pulse Proteolysis Assay
The method described by Young
and co-workers was used to conduct the pulse proteolysis experiment. PA (100 μg, 6 μM) or PA with 48
μg (12 μM) of CMG2 was incubated overnight at room temperature
in 200 μL of 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl,
10 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2. The next day, 20
μL of 5 mg/mL thermolysin prepared in 2.5 M NaCl and 10 mM CaCl2 was added to the 200 μL of PA and PA–CMG2 complex
samples and incubated at room temperature for various periods of up
to 120 min. Aliquots (15 μL) were withdrawn at the different
time points, to which 5 μL of 50 mM EDTA and 4 μL of 6×
SDS–PAGE sample buffer were added to stop the proteolysis.
The solution was then boiled for 5 min, and 15 μL of the solution
was run on a 15% SDS–PAGE gel.

pH* Titration Studies
PA (0.5 nmol) and the PA–CMG2
complex (0.5 nmol of PA and 2.5 nmol of CMG2) were placed in 100 μL
of buffer with different pH* values (4.5–9.0) that contains
20 mM CHES, 20 mM HEPES, 20 mM MES, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2 and incubated for 50 h at 37 °C. The pH* of the buffer
was adjusted with diluted DCl or NaOD. The reaction was stopped by
adding 5 μL of formic acid, and the protein was freed from the
buffer salts using an Ultra Micro Spin C4 column (Nest Group) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and dried in a Speed Vac.
The protein was redissolved in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and digested
with Lys-C alone, a combination of Lys-C and Glu-C, or a combination
of Lys-C and chymotrypsin as described above. The resulting digests
were dried in a Speed Vac, redissolved in 0.1% TFA, and then analyzed
by LC–MS/MS using an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer as described
previously. The pseudo-first-order rate
constant (k) of the HDX reaction was determined as
described above, and the k values were plotted as
a function of pH*, from which the pKa of
each histidine residue and the half-life (t1/2) of the HDX reaction were determined.

Structural Analysis
A comparison of protein structures
was performed using PyMOL (Molecular Graphics System software, DeLano
Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). The structural data of PA (PDB entry 3Q8B) and the PA–CMG2
complex (PDB entry 1T6B) deposited in the Protein Data Bank were used in the comparison.
The same structural data were used to obtain the ASA (solvent accessible
surface are) values for the C2 atoms of the histidine residues
using GETAREA.

Results and Discussion
Stability
of PA and PA Bound to CMG2
To investigate
how the stability of PA changes upon binding to CMG2, we conducted
Gdn-HCl-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments on PA alone and
PA complexed with CMG2, using His-HDX-MS. Histidine residues in a
protein that are protected (to at least a certain extent) from the
solvent become exposed to solvent upon unfolding of the protein caused
by increasing concentrations of Gdn-HCl, which subsequently increases
the magnitude of HDX rates for the histidine residues as the protein
unfolds. The histidine residues we monitored were His211, His253 (domain
1′), His336 (domain 2), and His616 (domain 4). Four peptides
containing these four histidine residues, each containing one histidine
residue, were detected by LC–MS/MS (Table S1 of the ), and their precursor
ion spectra were used to calculate the pseudo-first-order rate constants
(k) for their HDX reactions.

During the study,
it became apparent that the HDX rates obtained in the Gdn-HCl solution
must be corrected upward. This is because the concentration of water
in a highly concentrated Gdn-HCl solution (e.g., 5 M Gdn-HCl) is significantly
lower than the concentration of water in a solution without Gdn-HCl.
This means that the amount of a heavy water molecule (D2O) available in such a solution in a defined volume is significantly
small, causing us to underestimate the HDX rates. We determined the
relationship between the water and Gdn-HCl concentrations in various
concentrations of Gdn-HCl solutions, from which an equation to correct
upward the experimentally obtained HDX rates was obtained (see the ). All the HDX rates measured
in Gdn-HCl solutions were corrected using this equation.

In
Figure , Gdn-HCl-induced denaturation
curves of PA alone (dashed line) and PA complexed with CMG2 (solid
line) monitored at these four histidine residues are shown. PA denatured
rapidly at very low Gdn-HCl concentrations, which prevented determination
of the Cm value (midpoint of the Gdn-HCl-induced
unfolding transition) for PA alone accurately. Nevertheless, we estimated
the Cm values by visual inspection, which
were ≈0.2, ≈0.2, and ≈0.5 M for His211, His253,
and His616, respectively (Table ). The Cm value at His336 could not be determined, because
this histidine is already exposed well to solvent in the native structure
as indicated by the high HDX rate for this residue at 0 M Gdn-HCl
(Figure C, dashed line). The Cm values for PA complexed with CMG2 were ∼2–5-fold
larger than those for PA alone (approximately 1 M at all four histidine
residues) as shown in Table . The data in
Figure  are representative of three separate
experiments. The values of Cm (molar)
for the PA–CMG2 complex were reproducible to ±12%. His211
is ∼70 Å from the binding interface. Thus, our data indicate
that PA is stabilized throughout most of the protein by receptor binding,
and the unfolding of these residues, despite being located in different
domains, occurs at concomitant Gdn-HCl concentrations. In addition
to the Cm values, we were able to estimate
the standard state Gibbs free energy values from linear extrapolation
of the His-HDX values as a function of denaturant, in the presence
of CMG2. The calculated ΔG° values were
approximately 4–5 kcal mol–1 at all four
histidine residues (Table ), suggesting that
all are stabilized to a similar extent.

Gdn-HCl denaturation
curves of PA alone (---) and PA complexed
with CMG2 (—). PA and the PA–CMG2 complex were incubated
in 100 mM HEPES (pH* 7.5) at 37 °C for 48 h in various concentrations
of Gdn-HCl. After the incubation, the protein was digested and the
resulting peptides were analyzed by LC–MS/MS. The HDX rates
of four histidine residues, His211 (A), His253 (B), His336 (C), and
His616 (D), were monitored to follow the Gdn-HCl-induced denaturation
of PA.

Previous fluorescence and 19F NMR unfolding experiments
in urea have shown that PA unfolds in two transitions, the first transition
being assigned to the unfolding of domains 1′–4 and
the second transition being mainly due to the PA20 domain,
which after cleavage with furin can freely dissociate and is stable
on its own.,, Here, we followed the Gdn-HCl-induced unfolding of PA by fluorescence
in the presence of CMG2, where we have labeled CMG2 with 4-fluorotryptophan
(4-FTrp). This effectively eliminates the fluorescence contribution
from the sole tryptophan (Trp59) of CMG2, because 4-FTrp is a nonfluorescent
analogue of tryptophan (see the inset of Figure ). The structure of CMG2 is largely
unchanged upon labeling, as evidenced by the far-UV CD spectrum of
wild-type (WT) CMG2 and 4-FTrpCMG2 (Figure S2 of the ). Gdn-HCl-induced denaturation curves
of PA alone and PA complexed with 4-FTrpCMG2 are shown in Figure . As we observed previously in urea, PA undergoes
two transitions by fluorescence, which we again have assigned to the
unfolding of domains 1′–4 constituting the PA63 region of PA at a low Gdn-HCl concentration (∼0.2 M) and
to the PA20 domain at higher (∼1.3 M) Gdn-HCl concentrations. In the presence of CMG2, we observed one single
transition at a Cm of ∼1.3 M, suggesting
that domains 1′–4 were significantly stabilized by receptor
binding. We did not see a further increase in stability above that
of the PA20 domain, suggesting that receptor binding largely
stabilizes residues up to the PA20 region. In any case,
these results agree well with the results obtained with the His-HDX-MS
method.

the emitted light at 334 nm. The inset shows fluorescence emission
spectra of PA and PA complexed with 4-FTrpCMG2.

Protease Susceptibility of PA and PA Bound to CMG2
Resistance
to proteolysis is an effective way to probe accessibility
to unfolded conformations in a protein, and we hypothesized that CMG2
binding would “tighten” the structure of the protein
and decrease the rate of proteolytic degradation. To test whether binding of CMG2 stabilizes PA against proteolysis,
we incubated PA and the PA–CMG2 complex (1:2 ratio) at room
temperature with thermolysin for different periods of time and analyzed
the resulting reactions by SDS–PAGE. In the case of PA alone,
the undigested PA band disappeared within 30 s and appeared to be
cleaved into two fragments (50 and 40 kDa) (Figure A). The two fragments, however, did not last long, fading
away within 60 min. In the case of PA complexed with CMG2, the undigested
band similarly disappeared within 30 s; however, the generated 50
kDa band was clearly seen even after incubation for 120 min (Figure B). The 40 kDa band faded away also within 60 min.
To determine the thermolysin cleavage site, we analyzed the PA–CMG2
complex treated with thermolysin by LC–MS. We observed one
major peak, in addition to the peaks that correspond to thermolysin
and CMG2. The major peak gave a mass of 47007.4 Da and likely encompasses
the 50 kDa band. The molecular weight matched well to the calculated
molecular weight of the C-terminal portion of PA, Ile326–Gly745
(47002.5 Da). Thus, the 50 kDa band is likely the C-terminal portion
of PA produced by the hydrolysis between Asp315 and Ile316. The site
has a preferred sequence recognized by this protease (X-Ile, X-Leu,
X-Val, or X-Phe, where X is any amino acid) and falls within the flexible region (His304–Ser319) that
cannot be observed in the crystal structures of PA or the PA–CMG2
complex.,, The thermolysin
resistance of the C-terminal fragment suggests that CMG2 remains bound
to the C-terminal fragment after the proteolytic cleavage, thus providing
continued resistance against thermolysin.

Proteolysis of PA alone
(A) and PA complexed with CMG2 (B) by thermolysin.
PA or PA complexed with CMG2 (100 μg) was incubated with 100
μg of thermolysin at room temperature for various periods of
time (up to 120 min). Aliquots were withdrawn at the different time
points and run on a 15% SDS–PAGE gel.

pKa Values and His-HDX Rates
In previous studies, we compared, using His-HDX-MS, the effect of
CMG2 binding on the rate of exchange at pH* 9.5; however, we were unable to determine the pKa values of the histidines, which this technique also
allows. Therefore, in a manner similar to our previous work, we conducted
a pH* titration study on PA alone and the PA–CMG2 complex using
His-HDX-MS. The protein was deuterated in different pH* buffers (4.5–9.0),
digested, and then analyzed by LC–MS/MS. All 10 histidine residues
were detected in different peptides (Table S2 of the ). The rate constants (k) for HDX of those histidine residues were calculated directly from
their precursor ion spectra. The obtained k values
as a function of pH* for six histidine residues (His86, His263, His304,
His310, His336, and His597) are shown in Figure . We could not obtain interpretable sigmoid curves for His211, His253,
His299, and His616 because of their slow HDX rates. All the histidine
residues in Figure  gave simple sigmoid curves
corresponding to a single pKa except for
His263 in PA, which showed a steep rise above pH* 7 without an explicit
inflection point (Figure B, dashed line).
We believe this curve reflects the increased local conformational
fluctuation and reversible unfolding around this residue at alkaline
pH*, causing the histidine residue to be exposed more to solvent,
rather than reflecting the acid dissociation of this residue. The
phenomenon was not observed for the same residue in the PA–CMG2
complex (Figure B, solid line), suggesting
that binding to the receptor increases the stability of this region
against alkaline pH*. The k value for His336 (Figure E, solid line) in the PA–CMG2 complex was
too low to produce interpretable sigmoidal curves.

Measured
pKa values from the sigmoid curves for
His86, His304, His310, His336, and His597 are shown in Table . Significant changes in pKa for His86 and His310 were observed, which was surprising
given that His86 is &gt;90 Å from the binding interface. In general,
the pKa of histidines depends on several
factors; however, the lower the pKa (&lt;6),
the stronger the tendency to be buried and uncharged at neutral pH,
while a higher pKa (&gt;7.5) generally
reflects
the greater potential for charge–charge interactions. The pKa of His86 decreased 0.61 pH unit upon binding
to CMG2 (from ∼6.7 to 6.1), while the pKa of His310 increased 1.68 pH units. In previous work, we compared
the distances of the histidine residues to potential hydrogen bond
donors and/or acceptors and in general found that the distances became
shorter in the presence of CMG2. Indeed,
for His86, the distance to the Gln121 backbone carbonyl decreases
from 3.43 to3.07 Å, and this decreased distance is likely reflected
in a slight lowering of the pKa. In contrast
to that of His86, the pKa of His310 increased
1.68 pH units upon binding to CMG2, from 6.26 to 8.06. We are not
able to offer an interpretation of the observed pKa change of this residue because His310 is not observed
in the crystal structures of PA and the PA–CMG2 complex. However,
the increased pKa suggests that one or
more acidic side chains (e.g., Asp or Glu) may come close to His310
upon binding to CMG2. Indeed, Glu308, Glu302, and Asp315 are local
candidates for interacting with His310.

pH* dependence of the k for HDX at the imidazole
group of six histidine residues in PA alone (---) and PA complexed
with CMG2 (—). PA and the PA–CMG2 complex were incubated
at different pH* values (4.5–9.0) at 37 °C for 50 h. After
the incubation, the protein was digested and the resulting peptides
were analyzed by LC–MS/MS. The pH* dependencies of the k values for HDX for (A) His86, (B) His263, (C) His304,
(D) His310, (E) His336, and (F) His597 are shown.

The standard errors are associated
with the sigmoidal curve fitting.

The pKa could not be determined mainly
because of the slow HDX rate.

Calculated from k at pH 9.0 instead of using kmax, because kmax could not be obtained because of the lack
of an interpretable sigmoidal curve.

In addition to His86 and His310, we were able to determine
the
pKa values of His263 (for only the PA–CMG2
complex), His304, His336 (for only PA), and His597. The pKa of His263 in the PA–CMG2 complex was determined
to be 6.77, which is close to the intrinsic pKa value of a histidine residue (pKa ≈ 6.5), suggesting little electrostatic
influence of the neighboring groups on this residue. The pKa of His336 in PA was slightly higher (7.25)
than the intrinsic pKa value of the histidine
residue, suggesting there is a moderate influence of the electron-donating
group(s) around this residue. The pKa values
of His597 in both PA and the PA–CMG2 complex were shifted almost
2 pH units toward alkaline values (≥8), indicating there is
a negatively charged group(s) in the proximity of this histidine.
As expected, the imidazole ring of His597 is in the proximity of the
carboxyl group of Asp608 and likely forms a salt bridge to this residue,
in agreement with the crystal structure.

We previously reported the half-lives [t1/2 (days)] of the HDX reactions of histidine residues in PA. Those t1/2 values
were calculated from the HDX rates obtained at a single pH* (9.5).
In this study, we calculated the t1/2 values
from the maximal rate constant (kmax)
obtained from the plateau to the alkaline side of the sigmoid titration
curve as described previously. The t1/2 values calculated in this way are considered
to be more accurate, because they are calculated from the kmax values obtained from the pH* titration curves
fit to multiple data points. The t1/2 values
for His86, His263 (for only the PA–CMG2 complex), His304, His310,
His336 (for only PA), and His597 were successfully determined from
their kmax values and are listed in Table . We could not obtain interpretable sigmoidal curves
for the remaining histidine residues mainly because of their slow
HDX rates; therefore, the t1/2 values
for those histidine residues were calculated from the k obtained at pH* 9.0.

The significant increases in t1/2 values
due to receptor binding were observed for three histidine residues,
His263, His304, and His336, suggesting that their solvent accessibilities
decreased upon receptor binding. The increased t1/2 value for His263 is probably due to the increased level
of stabilization of the local structure against alkaline pH* that
occurs upon receptor binding as discussed above. Because His263 and
His336 are observed in structures of PA and the PA–CMG2 complex,
we compared the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) values for the
C2 atoms of the histidine residues. The ASA values for
His263 and His336 in both structures were comparable (His263, 15.5
Å2 for PA and 11.1 Å2 for the PA–CMG2
complex; His336, 20.3 Å2 for PA and 18.1 Å2 for the PA–CMG2 complex). Therefore, we cannot explain
the results based on the ASA values. This discrepancy may reflect
the difference in protein structures in the solution and crystals.
The HDX reaction of the C2 hydrogen of the imidazole group
occurs only when the neutral and protonated forms of the imidazole
group are in equilibrium and the C2 atom is in direct contact
with water., Therefore, the HDX reaction can
be diminished when the number of water molecules assisting the acid–base
equilibrium of the imidazole group or having contact with the C2 atom is reduced. Thus, our results indicate that receptor
binding tightens the structure of PA, which leads to expelling water
molecules around these histidine residues.

Long-Range Stabilization
of PA upon CMG2 Binding
Our
Gdn-HCl-induced unfolding experiments clearly show that PA is stabilized
by CMG2, and the stabilization occurs not only in the domain that
directly interacts with CMG2 (His616 located in domain 4) but also
in domains that do not have direct contact with CMG2 (His211 and His253
located in domain 1′). Thus, we can safely say that both our
combined His-HDX, fluorescence, and protease sensitivity assays indicate
that the stabilization afforded by binding of CMG2 occurs up to His211
(which is ∼70 Å from the binding interface) does not seemingly
further influence the stability of the PA20 domain. Nonetheless,
our pH titration study using His-HDX-MS revealed that the microenvironment
around histidine residues in PA20, domain 2, and domain
4 changes upon receptor binding. The altered pKa of His86 in the PA20 domain indicates that the
binding to CMG2 influences the microenvironment of His86 even though
the residue is far from the CMG2 binding interface (&gt;90 Å).

Influence of Receptor Binding on Domain 2 and Domain 4 Dynamics
How does receptor binding influence residues that are far from
the binding interface? Previous experiments by Feld and co-workers
have indicated that domain 2 and domain 4 are part of a hinge that
dictates the oligomeric assembly of PA63, such that a tighter interaction favors the formation of
heptamers, whereas a weaker interaction may favor the formation of
octamers. This implies that domain 2 and domain 4 are capable of hingelike
dynamic motions that likely give rise to an overall plasticity in
the protein. By anchoring the domain 2–domain 4 interface,
hingelike motions are prevented, which in turn would effectively stabilize
domain–domain interactions and other noncovalent interactions
within the protein.

The PA–CMG2 Complex as a Potential
Immunogen in a Future
Anthrax Vaccine
PA is the key component of anthrax vaccines
currently licensed as well as vaccines under development. Efforts to develop protective adjuvants that
do not require the use of a cold chain for storage in areas where
a cold chain is not accessible or feasible are ongoing. Our study
finds that CMG2 thermodynamically stabilizes PA, and thus, CMG2 may
prevent structural perturbations to the protein under long-term storage
conditions. Further, the addition of CMG2 slowed the rate of proteolysis
by thermolysin. Addition of CMG2 to the vaccine formulation may prevent
premature degradation of the protein postinjection, possibly allowing
for a greater proportion of PA to ultimately be presented on antigen-presenting
cells. Finally, depletion of the actual PA concentration amenable
for interacting with the host immune system likely occurs because
of the interaction of PA with receptors present on the surface of
host cells, and the inclusion of CMG2 in a vaccine formulation should
prevent such a depletion of PA.

His-HDX-MS as a Tool To
Investigate Protein Stability
Studies have shown that amide
HDX in combination with mass spectrometry
can be used to provide information about the stability of specific
regions within a protein.− This work demonstrates that His-HDX-MS
is complementary to amide HDX, and to other conventional methods such
as fluorescence spectroscopy and CD spectroscopy for monitoring protein
stability. The advantages of this method over other methods include
(1) the ability to follow the side chain stability at a single histidine,
which may be more sensitive to the folded state of a protein (because
it may be the last part to be stabilized), and to monitor the stabilities of different sites within a protein
simultaneously, (2) compared to NMR or CD, the absence of a requirement
for large amounts of protein, (3) the fact that proteins do not have
to be pure, because mass spectrometry can detect peptide masses even
in complex mixtures, and (4) the fact that proteins can be in seemingly
any environment, such as a soluble monomer or part of a large oligomeric
multiprotein complex within the membrane. These advantages will allow
us to study the stabilities of proteins in more complex structures
and cellular milieu.
