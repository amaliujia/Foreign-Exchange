The parathyroid
hormone 1 receptor
(PTH1R) is a major regulator of serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis
and plays an important role in hypercalcemia and osteoporosis.− Within osteoblasts, the activation of the PTH1R elicits two distinct
signaling pathways. One is the protein
kinase A (PKA) pathway in which adenylyl cyclase (AC) is stimulated
through Gαs, associated with an
increase in bone mass. Activation of this
pathway by parathyroid hormone (PTH), under the trade name Forteo,
has been developed as a treatment for osteoporosis., However,
the effectiveness of the treatment is limited and requires a precise
dosing regimen to maintain its anabolic effect.

In a parallel fashion, the stimulation of PTH1R when
it is bound
to the molecular scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchange
regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) leads to activation of the protein kinase
C (PKC) pathway through phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ). This pathway is associated with catabolic activity;
the overstimulation of this pathway is believed to be the cause of
bone loss resulting from continuously elevated levels of PTH. However, the presence of NHERF1 and consequential
activation of the PKC pathway are important for normal bone growth,
as NHERF1 null mice showed a reduction in the rate of bone reabsorption
as well as bone formation, resulting in bone that is 25% weaker because
of a lack of collagen cross-linking. Hence,
while completely eliminating signaling through PLCβ would have
deleterious effects on bone health, knocking down its activity through
intermittent dosing with a NHERF1 inhibitor may provide improved PTH
based therapies.

The selectivity in signaling imparted by NHERF1
is associated with
the stabilization of a complex between PTH1R and PLCβ, in which
the C-termini of these two transmembrane proteins bind to one of the
two PDZ domains of NHERF1. It was originally reported that the C-terminus
of PTH1R bound only to the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1, but not to the PDZ2
domain. This observation is likely the
result of the C-terminus of NHERF1 binding to the PDZ2 domain in an
autoinhibitory fashion. More recent results
have shown that the C-terminus of PTH1R is capable of binding to PDZ1
or PDZ2, with equal affinity. Interestingly,
this study also demonstrated that binding to the PDZ1 domain (by the
C-terminus of either PTH1R or PLCβ) leads to the homodimerization
of NHERF1 through the PDZ2 domains. This
has led to the model in which a dimer of NHERF1 (formed through the
PDZ2 domains) stabilizes the colocalization of PTH1R and PLCβ
by binding to their C-termini (through the PDZ1 domains). The resulting
protein complex is anchored to the cytoskeleton through interactions
with ezrin through the ERM (ezrin, radixin, and moesin) binding motif
at the C-terminus of NHERF1.

The
PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 is a class I PDZ domain that recognizes
the X-(S/T)-X-Φ-COOH sequence, where Φ is a hydrophobic
residue. The binding motif for the NHERF1 PDZ1 domain has been further
refined to include D/E-(S/T)-X-(L/V/I/M)-COOH.,− The four C-terminal amino acids of PTH1R (ETVM) are
consistent with this motif. The C-terminus of PLCβ (consisting
of DTPL and ESRL for the β1 and β2 isozymes, respectively)
has also been shown to bind NHERF1. Interestingly,
the C-terminus of PLCβ3 was reported to bind to the PDZ2 domain
of NHERF1.

Here, we aim to identify
small molecule inhibitors of the interaction
of the C-terminus of PTH1R with the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1. Such a
molecule could serve as an important physiological tool for ascertaining
the importance of this interaction in the regulation of PTH1R stimulation,
possibly providing an avenue to address hypercalcemia. As NHERF1 has
been implicated in many cancers, acting as a molecular scaffold in
the regulation of transmembrane receptors, an inhibitor could provide
valuable insight into the mechanism of action. NHERF1 is also highly expressed in the kidneys where it
is linked to renal phosphate wasting, and therefore, a PDZ1 domain specific inhibitor would be a valuable
tool. Employing a combination of computational and nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR)-based screening methods, we have identified a number
of small molecules that bind to the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1. The experimentally
validated hits were tested for their ability to inhibit the interaction
of the 17 C-terminal amino acids of PTH1R with the NHERF1 PDZ1 domain
using NMR and fluorescence polarization. We further optimized the
inhibitor and conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine
the potential of future derivatives.

Experimental Procedures
Protein
Expression and Purification
Human NHERF1 PDZ1
(1–140) was cloned into a pET16 b(+) vector with an N-terminal
10-histidine tag. Unlabeled NHERF1 PDZ1 was expressed by growing a
250 mL culture of BL21 RIL Escherichia coli. The
culture was induced at an OD600 between 0.6 and 0.8 by
adding IPTG to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. After induction, the
culture was grown at 20 °C for 16–18 h. For 15N-enriched and 15N- and 13C-enriched protein
expression, the culture was grown to a density with an OD600 between 3 and 4, spun down, and resuspended in minimal medium of
equal volume [48 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 43 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.25× metal ion solution, 0.25× BME vitamins,
0.25× thiamine, 3 g/L 15NH4Cl, and 10 g/L
[13C]glucose (pH 8.0)].

NHERF1 PDZ1 was purified by first pelleting the E. coli cells at 4000 rpm for 15 min. Pelleted cells were resuspended in
lysis buffer [50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.02% (w/v)
NaN3, 2 mM MgCl2, 3 μL Benzonase per 50
mL, and 1 Roche protease inhibitor tablet per 50 mL (pH 8.5)]. The
resuspended cells were lysed using a French press, at a pressure of
1500 psi. The lysate was spun down at 40000 rpm for 25 min. The supernatant
was loaded onto a GE 5 mL HisTrap HP column using an ÄKTAxpress
instrument. The column was washed with wash buffer after being loaded
until a steady baseline was reached (absorbance of 280 nm). The wash
buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, and 10 mM imidazole (pH 8.5). A 20 column volume gradient of elution
buffer was used to elute NHERF1 PDZ1. Fractions (1.8 mL) of the elutant
were collected. The elution buffer was the same with 400 mM imidazole.
Fractions containing NHERF1 PDZ1, as determined by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were further
purified through size exclusion chromatography using an ÄKTA
purifier with a Superdex 75 16/60 column. The size exclusion buffer
was the same as the wash buffer used for the 5 mL HisTrap column purification,
without imidazole. The fractions containing NHERF1 PDZ1 were concentrated
using 10000 molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrators, spinning
at 3000g and mixing at intervals of 15 min. Protein
that was to be frozen for later use was dialyzed into 25 mM sodium
phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3,
and 5% (v/v) glycerol (pH 7.4). A reading of absorbance at 280 nm
was used to quantify NHERF1 PDZ1 with an extinction coefficient of
2464 M–1 cm–1, as determined by
Keck MS and Proteomics Resources at Yale University (New Haven, CT).

The C-terminal 17-amino acid peptide of human PTH1R (GPERPPALLQEEWETVM)
was expressed with a N-terminal thirodoxin (Trx) tag in a pET32a vector. A tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage
site was inserted between the Trx tag and peptide. After cleavage
by the TEV protease, only the 17 C-terminal amino acids of human PTH1R
(PTH1Rct) remained. A detailed description of the production and NMR
assignment of the peptide was published previously.

NMR Experiments
Experiments for
ligand binding analysis
and titrations to determine KD values
were conducted on a Bruker Avance III 700 MHz NMR instrument, equipped
with a 5 mm TCI cryoprobe. All experiments were conducted at 298 K.
Samples for initial ligand screening used a concentration of 50 μM
NHERF1 PDZ1 (1–140) and 2 mM ligand, in a buffer consisting
of 25 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 1% (v/v) DMSO-d6, and 5% (v/v)
D2O (pH 6.8). For 1H–15N HSQC
experiments, 16 scans were collected with 1024 points in the 1H dimension and 128 in the 15N dimension. Ligand KD values were determined using the same method
except that the buffer contained 2.5% (v/v) DMSO-d6. The ligand concentrations used for the titration were
0, 0.33, 0.67, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mM. 1H–15N HSQC spectra were processed using Topspin and analyzed using Sparky
3.115. The chemical shift perturbation
was calculated using eq .where Δobs is the normalized chemical shift, Δ1H is the change in the chemical shift in the 1H
dimension,
and Δ15N is the change in the chemical
shift in the 15N dimension.

Analysis of the normalized
peak shift values was conducted in Kaleidagraph 4.01, and eq  was used to determine Kd values.where Δobs is the observed
change in the chemical shift, Δmax is the chemical
shift when the protein is completely saturated with ligand, L is the ligand concentration, and P is
the protein concentration.

The competition binding experiments
were conducted on a Bruker
Avance III 600 MHz NMR instrument, equipped with a 1.7 mm cryoprobe.
The control sample consisted of 75 μM unlabeled NHERF1 PDZ1
with 30 μM 15N-labeled PTH1R C-terminus, in a buffer
that consisted of 25 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM TCEP,
0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 5% (v/v) DMSO-d6, and 5% (v/v) D2O (pH 6.8). DMSO-d6 was used to solubilize the core-CH3 for addition
to the sample. For 1H–15N HSQC experiments,
16 scans were collected with 1024 points in the 1H dimension
and 128 in the 15N dimension. The assignment of NHERF1
PDZ1 will be detailed in a separate publication and was deposited
in the BMRB as entry 19781.

Fluorescence Polarization Assay
Fluorescence polarization
(FP) measurements were taken on a Tecan Infinity 500 plate reader.
All experiments were conducted at 298 K in triplicate. Data were processed
using Kaleidagraph 4.01. The buffer used for the FP assay consisted
of 25 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM TCEP, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 0.5 mM Thesit, and 0.1 mg/mL IgG (pH 7.4). The 16 fluorescently
tagged C-terminal amino acids of PTH1R [FITC]βaPERPPALLQEEWETVM
(FITC-PTH1Rct) were used for the assay. For all experiments, the concentration
of FITC-PTH1Rct was 30 nM. For the competition experiment, a NHERF1
PDZ1 (1–140) concentration of 19 μM was used. KD was calculated using eq .where FPmin is the FP value when
no ligand is bound, FPmax is the FP value when all ligand
is bound, L is the ligand concentration, and P is the protein concentration.

To determine the IC50 value, we applied a four-parameter logistics function (see
eq ).where FPmin is the value when no
ligand is bound, FPmax is the FP value when all ligand
is bound, IC50 is the concentration of ligand at which
half the peptide binding is inhibited, and A is the
slope factor.

Library Screening
For computational
screening, we used
the apo-NHERF1 PDZ1 structure available from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) (entry 1G9O) and a 3000-compound diversity library
developed from Life Chemicals. The screenings were conducted using
Molecular Operating Environment 2012.10. Ligands were docked into the canonical peptide binding groove of
NHERF1 PDZ1, including the GYGF loop. “Triangle Matcher” was used for the placement of ligands
and “London dG” for the scoring of ligands.

To
generate a model of core-CH3 binding to the PDZ domain,
we used Autodock 4.0. The structures
resulting from Autodock that were in agreement with the chemical shift
perturbation data from NMR were selected for further refinement via
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We used the energy-minimized 1G9O structure [using
NAMD (see below)] and the default docking parameters, with the following
exceptions: ga_pop_size = 300 and ga_run = 256. It has been noted
that increasing the ga_pop_size up to 300 improves the results from
docking. The ligand efficiency of the
docking results was calculated using eq .where
LE is the ligand efficiency, ΔG is the Gibbs
free energy, and N is the
number of non-hydrogen atoms.

Energy minimization and MD simulations
were conducted with NAMD
2.9. Input files were generated using
VMD 1.9.1, psfgen 1.6, and solvate 1.5. The simulation box (48.4 Å
× 48.0 Å × 43.4 Å) was solvated with TIP3P water
with Na+ and Cl– ions added to neutralize
the system. Structures were energy minimized
for 50000 steps (0.1 ns), followed by 2500000 steps (5 ns) of MD (step
size of 2 fs) at 300 K and 1.01 bar. Identical MD simulations were
conducted with the methyl group of core-CH3 replaced by
the following groups: -CH2CH3, -CH(CH3)2, -C(CH3)3, -CH2CH2CH3, -CH2CH2CH2CH3, and -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. Analysis of hydrogen bonding was conducted
in VMD 1.9.1, using the parameters of a N–O distance of 3.5
Å and an angle of 90°. Hydrogen bond analysis was limited
to the last 3.5 ns of the simulation, after equilibrium had been reached.
Figures were created using Chimera 1.6.1.

Results
Of the 10 lowest-energy structures from our
computational screen
of the 3000-compound library, nine were commercially available and
therefore examined experimentally (Figure 1 of the ). On the basis of the chemical shift
perturbation of the assigned 1H–15N HSQC
NMR spectrum of NHERF1 PDZ1 (Figure ), only
one (F0911–3941) bound (see Figure 2 of the  for all chemical shift perturbations).
Mapping of the chemical shift perturbations onto the structure of
the PDZ domain clearly demonstrates that the compound is binding in
the canonical peptide binding groove and interacting with the GYGF
loop (Figure C). Note that the construct used
for our NMR experiments contained NHERF1(1–140), which is necessary
to enhance solution stability, while the X-ray structure (PDB entry 1G90) used in our modeling,
and in the figures, consists of only NHERF1(9–99). Importantly,
in all of our NMR experiments, there was no evidence that the extra
amino acids interacted with any of the peptides or small molecules
that were examined.

of residues (red) that undergo a significant perturbation (more than

The ability of F0911–3941 to inhibit the
interaction of
PTH1Rct with NHERF1 PDZ1 was examined by fluorescence polarization
experiments. We observed that FITC-labeled PTH1Rct bound to NHERF1
PDZ1 with an affinity of 19 ± 2 μM (see Figure 3 of the ). A KD value of 11 μM had previously been reported in
the literature. With a PDZ1 concentration
of 9 μM and the FITC-tagged PTH1Rct at a concentration of 30
nM, we observed an IC50 of 50 ± 5 μM for F0911–3941
(Figure ). This value is likely a low estimate
given the amount of NHERF1 PDZ1 used in the experiment was only sufficient
for 33% occupancy.

Compound
F0911–3941 competes for the binding of the C-terminus of PTH1R
to the PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 with an IC50 value of 50 ±
5 μM.

To develop a structure–activity
relationship for F0911–3941,
we searched the ZINC database for small molecules that were 50% structurally
similar. This search yielded 1272 compounds.
Using computational docking, these compounds were examined for their
ability to bind to NHERF1 PDZ1. Of the 10 lowest-energy hits, eight
were commercially available and examined for binding by NMR (see Figure
4 and Table 1 of the ). On the basis of chemical shift perturbation, all eight compounds
were found to bind to the GYGF loop of NHERF1 PDZ1 in a manner similar
to that of F0911–3941. However, given the low affinity of these
compounds, as measured by NMR (Table 1 of the ), they were not pursued further.

As an alternative approach, we asked if the central core scaffold
of F0911–3941 (denoted as core-CH3) displayed any
affinity for NHERF1 PDZ1. In Figure B, a superposition
of the 1H–15N HSQC spectra of NHERF1
PDZ1 with and without the core-CH3 structure is shown,
clearly demonstrating binding within the canonical peptide binding
groove and interaction with the GYGF loop (see Figure 5 of the  for a graph of all chemical
shift perturbations). The mapping of the chemical shift perturbation
(one standard deviation above the average) onto the X-ray structure
of PDZ1 is shown in Figure C. Next we tested
the ability of core-CH3 to inhibit the interaction of PTH1Rct
with NHERF1 PDZ1. Unfortunately, core-CH3 has an absorbance
profile that makes it unsuitable for FP experiments. We therefore
turned to NMR employing an 15N-labeled PTH1Rct, which allowed
us to observe the peptide while free and while bound to PDZ1. With
a sample of 30 μM [15N]PTH1Rct as a starting point
(the free spectrum), 75 μM natural abundance NHERF1 PDZ1 was
added providing the bound spectrum. As shown in Figure A, many of the peptide peaks are broadened below the noise
when it is bound to NHERF1 PDZ1. Upon the addition of core-CH3, the spectrum of the peptide moves toward the unbound state
(see Figure B). Using a conservative estimate
that 95% of NHERF1 PDZ1 is bound to core-CH3, an approximate KD of ≤300 μM can be calculated
for the binding of core-CH3 to NHERF1 PDZ1.

it is free (blue).

To obtain greater insight
into the interaction of core-CH3 with NHERF1 PDZ1, docking
and MD simulations were conducted. From
AutoDock, the lowest-energy complex conformation had a ΔG of −6.07 kcal mol–1, resulting
in a ligand efficiency of 0.43 kcal mol–1 heavy
atom–1 for core-CH3. The subsequent MD
simulations demonstrated that this was a stable structure with a number
of hydrogen bonds between core-CH3 and Y24 and G25 (Figure ). Additionally, during the simulations, there is
a shift in β-strand 2 of NHERF1 PDZ1, as a result of core-CH3
binding, consistent with the chemical shift perturbations in β-strand
2 upon binding. The amide resonance of G25 is broadened below the
noise level, suggesting an interaction with core-CH3. Unfortunately,
Y24 was not identified during our resonance assignment. We believe
that ligand binding may also have some long-range effects on β2
and helix α2. A superposition of the NHERF1 PDZ1 structure before
and after the MD simulation is provided as Figure 6 of the .

bonds are shown as dashed lines. Residues Y24 and G25 were shown to

F26 and R80 did not appear to interact significantly with core-CH3 during the simulation, they did show significant chemical
shift perturbation. (B) Plot of the distances between the amide proton
of Y24 and O3 (blue) and between G25 and O2 (green).

To examine the possibility of functionalizing the
core, we conducted
additional MD simulations. Given the hydrophobic nature of the pocket,
we restricted the search of substituent groups to hydrocarbons. The
methyl of the core was replaced with the following R groups: -C(CH3)3, -CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH3, -CH2CH2CH3, -CH2CH2CH2CH3, and -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3. We observed
that any R group with more than three carbons was not well tolerated
within the binding pocket; there were multiple steric clashes, requiring
significant conformational changes of helix α2 that were energetically
unfavorable. However, the compounds containing the R groups -C(CH3)3, -CH(CH3)2, -CH2CH3, and -CH3 were all found to be energetically
favorable based on the MD simulations (see Figure 7 of the ).

Discussion
More
than 150 human proteins containing at least one PDZ domain
have been identified. The PDZ domain binds to the C-terminus of its
partner proteins, often in the role of a molecular scaffold. As such,
the PDZ domains are designed to enhance the local concentrations of
the interacting proteins, bringing them into the proximity of each
other to facilitate an interaction that is transient and not designed
to be long-lived., Consistent with this physiological
role, the binding affinities for PDZ domains are typically in the
low micromolar range. Accordingly, the binding pocket of PDZ domains
is shallow and relatively nondescript with very few points of interaction,, and therefore, the interactions of PDZ domains with their targets
are typically difficult to inhibit.,

Although
it is a difficult task, there have been some successes
in inhibiting the interactions with PDZ domains reported within the
literature. Interestingly, most of the successful compounds are based
on an indole scaffold,− including a compound that has been shown to bind to NHERF1 and inhibit
the interaction with the C-terminus of cystic fibrosis transmembrane
regulator. In contrast, we present a
novel inhibitor, characterized by a quinoxaline core. Another striking
difference between our inhibitor and the previous small molecules
is the manner in which they target the GYGF loop: most of the compounds
previously reported contain a carboxyl group to interact with the
GYGF loop, in a fashion analogous to that of the C-terminus of the
naturally occurring peptides. In contrast, the compound presented
here interacts with the carboxylate binding loop via a hydroxyl group
and a carbonyl within the ring system (Figure A). A similar interaction has been presented by Thorsen et al. in
which an acryoylcarbamate inhibitor interacts with the GYGF loop via
a dichlorophenyl group instead of a carboxylic acid. A significant advantage of the compound presented here
is the small size; the molecular weight of our core compound is only
192, but it still maintains a micromolar IC50. Most of
the compounds presented previously are much larger while still providing
IC50 values in the micromolar range.

Future efforts
will focus on defining the regions of the molecule
that can be modified to enhance the affinity. On the basis of the
refined complex structure (Figure A), the
replacement of O1 with an aldehyde or methyl hydroxyl would allow
for hydrogen bonds with the side chain of R80 while simultaneously
maintaining the hydrogen bonds between O2 and O3 and the backbone
of the GYGF loop. Another potential improvement targets the small
lipophilic side chains at the position of the methyl in core-CH3 (see Figure 7 of the ). On the basis of our preliminary simulations, small modifications
are feasible and may provide additional interaction with the PDZ1
domain and thereby enhance affinity. Following along the lines of
the acryoylcarbamate inhibitor of Thorsen et al., we can envision addition of substitutions to the benzene
ring that would provide additional interactions within the peptide
binding groove.

In conclusion, core-CH3 identified
here binds to the
PDZ1 domain of NHERF1 and competes with the binding of the C-terminus
of PTH1R. The potency of the inhibitor is in line with those of other
PDZ inhibitors reported in the literature, but the small molecule
has the advantage of a low molecular weight, allowing for further
elaboration to increase its binding affinity. Further modifications
would certainly be required for specificity. Indeed, given the mode
of binding proposed here, we postulate that core-CH3 will
bind to PDZ2 of NHERF1 given that all of the main interactions are
with the backbone of the GYGF loop, a feature maintained by both PDZ
domains of NHERF1 and many other PDZ domains. Efforts to enhance the
affinity and specificity by the elaboration of core-CH3 as outlined here are currently underway.
