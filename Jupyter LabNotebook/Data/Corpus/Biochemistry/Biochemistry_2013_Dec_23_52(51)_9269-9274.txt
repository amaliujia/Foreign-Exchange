Introduction
Human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a positive-sense,
diploid RNA retrovirus of the Lentivirus family. HIV-1 is the major
cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) worldwide. While
current antiviral treatments have had a profound impact on the life
expectancy of infected individuals, HIV-1 remains a major global health
problem with reports estimating 34 million people infected worldwide
in 2010 (UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report, 2011; www.unaids.org). New therapeutics are still needed as the virus is highly variable,
and drug resistance by mutational escape develops swiftly.

Most of the traditional and recent antiviral
drugs such as emtricitabine,
rilpivirine, maraviroc, and raltegravir target the early life cycle
of HIV-1, prior to integration of the provirus, the one exception
being the protease inhibitor class such as saquinavir and lopinavir. One such target of the HIV-1 late life cycle
is the interaction between Gag, the major structural protein of HIV-1,
and the full-length viral RNA genome, in which the
viral polyprotein Gag binds the viral RNA with a high degree of specificity
through the Ψ-packaging domain located within the 5′-UTR
(Figure ). Following this initial binding,
further Gag protein binding and subsequent trafficking to the host
cell membrane allows packaging of the RNA genome into the budding
viron.−

representation of the in vitro biophysical assay.
Attached to the 5′ and 3′ ends of stem loop 3 (SL3)
are the TET fluorophore and blackhole quencher (BHQ1), respectively,
which form a destabilization assay in the presence of Gag. Small molecules
that inhibit the destabilation of SL3 are taken forward, after validation,
to a viral replication assay.

Targeting RNA or RNA–protein interactions with small
molecules
has been a relatively unexplored approach to small molecule intervention
compared to targeting protein active sites, with few examples, besides targeting the rRNA. Herman et al. targeted the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
of the hepatitis C virus (HCV); Butcher et al. and al-Hashimi et al. targeted
the frameshift and transactivation response (TAR) elements from HIV-1,
respectively. Cis-acting RNA elements such as the IRES, frameshift
sites, TAR and Ψ are far more highly conserved than conventional
protein targets, and mutational escape is therefore more difficult.

The core packaging domain of HIV-1 comprises
three stem loops (SL):
SL1 is the dimerization initiation site, SL2 contains the major splice
donor, and SL3 is known as the critical packaging element (Figure ).− These regions have been extensively interrogated by mutagenesis
to elucidate each SL’s contributions to genomic RNA packaging,, This has led to the concept that a structural switch occurs within
the 5′-UTR; associated with the change in function from translation
to encapsidation of the full-length RNA genome.− The switch
is suggested to be triggered by the binding of one or more Gag proteins
to the 5′-UTR., Gag is the structural polyprotein
of HIV-1 consisting of four major domains: the N-terminus matrix (MA-p17),
capsid (CA-p24), nucleocapsid (NC-p7), and the C-terminus p6. Gag is the effector molecule recognizing the
Ψ-packaging domain (and in particular SL3) in vivo. Thus, it is vital to use the authentic RNA ligand, the Gag polyprotein,
to identify a compound that will be inhibitory to RNA packaging in vivo, which, until now, has not been done.

Herein
we describe the identification of small molecules that are
able to disrupt the HIV-1 Gag/RNA interaction in vitro using a destablisation assay based on the interaction of the Gag
protein with the 14 base tetraloop of SL3 (Figure ). We then characterize the identified small molecules using
a cell based assay activity and highlight the selective binding of
NSC260594 to the tetraloop of SL3 by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Results
and Discussion
Initially we employed a fluorogenic destabilization
assay (Figure ) based on Gag’s ability
to affect the structure
of a molecular beacon modeled on SL3 of the Ψ-packaging domain. This assay was used to screen the LOPAC (1280
molecules, Sigma) and Diversity Set II (1363 molecules, NIH) libraries
with positive hits being defined as small molecules showing inhibition
greater than three standard deviations (21%) from the mean negative
control. On each plate, the positive (SL3) and negative (SL3 and Gag)
controls were used to calculate the Z′ score,
and any plate that failed to gain a Z′ greater
than 0.5 was rejected and the plate was rescreened. Confirmation of the primary hits was performed in triplicate
under the original screening conditions, and 78 compounds were identified
().

To assess the biological activity, of the compounds shortlisted
by the in vitro screen on HIV-1 replication, we employed a viral replication
assay based on protocols from Hu et al. (). The
protease inhibitor drugs saquinavir and
lopinavir were used as positive antiviral
controls as these FDA-approved drugs affect late stages of the viral
life cycle (). Furthermore, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) directed
against the CA-p24 domain of the Gag polyprotein was used to quantify
inhibition of virus production by the small molecules. Because of either high cytotoxicity (≤20
μM) of the small molecule on the 293T cells or low efficacy
(≥20 μM) of the small molecule within the viral replication
assay 75 of the 78 compounds were discarded () leaving compounds A1895, R0529,
and NSC260594 (). A1895 was discarded as A1895 has been identified in previous studies
looking at the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein.− R0529 shares
structural similarities to the Hoechst series of nucleic acid dyes
which are known to interact nonspecifically with DNA and RNA., NSC260594 is a quinolinium derivative similar in structure to known
DNA binding compounds such as SN 6999 and SN 7167., Quinolinium derivatives are known to bind in the minor groove of
DNA, but DNA minor groove binders have previously been documented
as having little to no binding toward RNA. While R0529 and NSC260594 both showed efficacy, both in the initial
screen based on the RNA hairpin SL3 and the viral replication assay,
far less is known about the interaction of NSC260594 with RNA.

Furthermore, the effect of NSC260594 on virus production (measured
by the CA-p24 ELISA) reflects the effect on viral infectivity (Figure ), indicating that NSC260594 affects particle production
and release. This is consistent with studies involving mutations to
Ψ, which show a similar decrease in particle production and
infectivity levels. This is in contrast to the protease inhibitors
saquinavir and lopinavir, where the effect on p24 production occurs
at a far higher concentration than the effect on viral replication
(). For these reasons we decided to focus our attention on NSC260594
and its interaction with the SL3 RNA.

Biological activity of NSC260594. (A)
24 h postinfection the expression
of β-galactosidase within the TZM-bl cell were imaged using
X-Gal (blue spots in images). (B) Viability of the 293T cells (blue
line, 50% inhibition (CC(50) = N/A)), viral production
from transfected 293T (green line, 50% inhibition (p24(50) = 11.3 ± 3.4 μM)) and infectivity of harvested viral
particles (red line 50% inhibition (IC(50) = 4.5 ±
1.8 μM)) in the presence of different concentrations of NSC260594.

We then employed circular dichroism
(CD) (), fluorescence melting () and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figures  and ) to provide structural insight on the binding
of NSC260594 to the RNA SL3 of the HIV-1 Ψ packaging domain.
From both the CD and fluorescence melting experiments we determined
that NSC260594 was interacting with SL3, with the fluorescence melting
data showing that above 30 μM of NSC260594 the RNA hairpin could
not be melted at 95 °C ().

Interaction between the structural analogue of SL3 (WT-3)
and the
two small molecules, NSC260594 and ellipticine, as monitored by 1H NMR. (A) Secondary structures of the WT-3 hairpin. In gray
are reported the nucleotides added to SL3 in order to have a well-defined
secondary structure suitable for NMR spectroscopy and in red the G9,
G10, and G12 guanines constituting the tetraloop of SL3. (B) 3-D model
of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid–WT-3 complex (PDB 1A1T) depicting the protein
and the RNA hairpin with a green and white ribbon, respectively. The
G9, G10, and G12 guanines essential for binding to the HIV-1 nucleocapsid
are represented in red. (C) WT-3 1H NMR titration experiments
with an increasing amount of the compounds NSC260594 and ellipticine.
The imino protons between 12 and 14.5 ppm (blue region) are attributed
to the Watson–Crick H-bonded base pairs of the stem of the
hairpin structure and imino protons between 10 and 11 ppm (red region)
are attributed to the WT-3 loop G bases. Red stars (★) highlight
the alteration of the G9, G10, and G12 imino signals, and black diamonds
(⧫) highlight peaks attributed to ellipticine.

For the 1H NMR spectroscopy Borer et
al. had previously
characterized and assigned the imino proton shifts of a stabilized
SL3 derivative (WT-3). The imino proton
NMR spectrum for WT-3 at pH 7.0 displayed well-defined peaks between
12 and 14.5 ppm due to Watson–Crick hydrogen bonded base pairs
within the stem of the hairpin structure, and by lowering the pH to
5.0, new imino signals appeared in the 10–11 ppm range (Figures  and ). These new peaks are attributed to the imino
protons of unpaired guanines (G9, G10, and G12) in the loop of SL3. 1H NMR titration experiments were performed at pH 5.0 to monitor
the interaction of NSC260594 with WT-3 focusing on the effect on the
loop imino protons of the hairpin structure. Titration of an increasing
amount of NSC260594 (up to 1.5 mol equiv) caused little change to
the imino peaks relative to the stem of WT-3 (peaks between 12 and
14.5 ppm, Figures  and ); by contrast the imino peaks attributed to guanines in
the G9-G10-A11-G12 RNA tetraloop (peaks between 10 and 11 ppm) are
significantly altered by up to 1 mol equiv of NSC260594 (Figures C and ). A new imino
peak at 10.23 ppm appeared upon the addition of 0.5 mol equiv of NSC260594
and further shifted upfield and sharpened following the addition of
additional amounts of the compound. The existing peak at 10.90 ppm
is broadened upon addition of NSC260594. These results suggest a well-defined
recognition of the loop by the small molecules NSC260594. Increasing
the molar equivalents of NSC260594 to greater than 1 caused no further
changes of imino protons for WT-3 (), consistent with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry
of NSC260594 by the RNA WT-3 tetraloop. As a control, similar titration
experiments were performed with the known nonspecific intercalator
ellipticine. Upon addition of ellipticine, the imino protons of the
stem of WT-3 were most perturbed, while no significant changes were
observed for the imino protons of unpaired guanines G9-G10-A11-G12
of the loop (Figure C). Indeed, the titration
gives rise to the appearance of major new sharp resonances around
12.7 ppm, suggesting stabilization of the stem of the hairpin. Furthermore,
the imino proton spectra continued to alter at equivalents greater
than 1 molar (). These results are consistent with the nonspecific intercalation
of ellipticine into the stem of the WT3 hairpin structure.

The
alteration of imino protons within the loop of WT-3 by NSC260594
compared to the change of the imino protons within the stem of WT-3
by ellipticine shows that the two small molecules have very different
modes of interactions with WT-3, and we hypothesize that NSC260594
recognizes the tetra-nucleotide loop of WT-3 and hinders the binding
of the Gag protein. The binding of HIV-1 NC protein to the RNA SL3
has been well characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (PDB 1A1T, Figure B). The SL3/NC structure
revealed that tight binding is mediated by specific interactions between
the NC protein and the G9-G10-A11-G12 RNA tetraloop. In the same way that mutation of the tetraloop inhibits
Gag interactions, binding of a small molecule here is likely to have
a similar disruptive effect.

In summary, we have developed and
applied an assay to identify
small molecules that disrupt the Gag/SL3 protein RNA interaction.
We then identified a subset of these molecules that showed biological
activity in a viral infectivity assay. Compound NSC260594 was found
to bind specifically to the tetraloop of SL3 of the HIV-1 Ψ-packaging
domain as judged by 1H NMR spectroscopy. These studies
represent a proof of concept for the identification of specific small
molecule inhibitors of RNA/protein interactions that are critical
for the HIV-1 life cycle.

Methods and Materials
Reagents
The RNA
oligonucleotides WT (CUA GCG GAG GCU
AG) and FQ WT (Tet-CUA GCG GAG GCU AG-BHQ1) and WT-3 (GGA CUA GCG
GAG GCU AGU CC) were synthesized and purified by IBA GmbH. Stock solutions
(100 μM for WT and FQ WT and 1 mM for WT-3) were made by resuspending
the RNA in molecular biology grade water and quantified by A260 at 95 °C, using the ε260 value as provided by the manufacturers, before the RNAs were aliquoted
and stored at −80 °C. All samples were freshly prepared
prior to each experiment, and the FQ WT was heated at 95 °C for
5 min and snap-cooled on ice for a further 5 min, before the addition
of the appropriate buffer. The expression and purification of the
GagΔp6 protein have been reported previously with the exception
that the purified GagΔp6 was rebuffered in 25 mM NaOAc, pH 6.5,
200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.25 mM ZnCl2 by gel filtration.

Small Molecule Screen
The small
molecule screen was
performed with a combination of the LOPAC 1280 (Sigma) and Diversity
Set II (NIH) libraries. The libraries were condensed from their original
10 mM DMSO stocks in a 96-well format to daughter plates containing
2 mM DMSO stocks in a 384-well format, with 320 small molecules and
64 empty wells for controls per plate.

For screening, each small
molecule from the daughter plates was first diluted to 100 μM
in buffer (25 mM NaOAc, pH 6.5) before 2 μL was transferred
to the 384 well assay (low volume flat bottom black NBS treated, Corning
3820). To the small molecules 4 μL of a 0.25 μM solution
of FQ WT RNA (25 mM NaOAc, 2.5 mM MgCl2) was added, and
the microplate was allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h
before 4 μL of a 2.5 μM GagΔp6 solution (25 mM NaOAc,
pH 6.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.25 mM ZnCl2) was added,
and the plate was incubated for 45 min at room temperature.

DMSO only (0.5% v/v) wells, which contained no small molecule,
were used as a negative control, while positive controls well consisted
of either an FQ WT RNA only or WT RNA as a “small molecule”
control. Dilution, transfer, and mixing of all solutions were carried
out using a Biomek NX liquid handling robot (Beckman Coulter). The
fluorescent measurements were taken at 25 °C using a Pherastar+ platereader (BMG LabTech) with an excitation filter of 510
nm and an emission filter of 540 nm.

Tissue Culture
HEK293T (ATCC CRL-11268) and TZM-bl
(ATCC) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL
penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, in humidified air with
5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were grown in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks and split 1:10 twice a week. The TZM-bl cell
line is a HeLa derivative that has been genetically engineered to
express CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 surface receptors, along with β-galactosidase
and firefly luciferase genes under the transcriptional control of
the HIV-1 LTR.

Virus Preparation and Cytotoxicity
Assays
Compounds
of interest from the small molecules screen were reordered from either
Sigma-Aldrich or the NIH and dissolved as 25 mM DMSO stocks. The 293T
cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning) at a
density of 1.86 × 105 cells/well in 150 μL of
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 24 h prior transfection. To prepare
the VSV-G-pseudotyped virus 293T cells were transfected (TransIT-LT1,
Mirus) with the Env-defective proviral DNA (pNL-Kp) and VSV-G (pVSV-G)
plasmids., Six hours post transfection, the small molecules
were added at the appropriate concentration (0–33 μM)
in 25 μL of media, and the cells were cultured for an additional
24 h. Transfection efficiency was measured by the addition of a GFP-expressing
vector (pEGFP-N1; Clontech). Viral production was measured by a p24-Capsid
ELISA, and cytotoxicity of the small molecules was determined using
the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocols.

Infectivity Assays
TZM-bl cells
were seeded onto 96-well
tissue culture plates at a density of 1.86 × 105 cells/well
in 150 μL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 24 h prior to infection.
The TZM-bl cells were challenged with 50 μL of supernatant from
the transfected 293T cells and incubated for 24 h. Viral infectivity
was visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-Gal, Sigma) and quantified using the 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG, Sigma) measured at 420 nm using a
Multiskan microplate reader (Thermo Electron).

P24 Capsid ELISA
Half area, white, high binding 96-well
plates (Greiner) were coated overnight with sheep anti-HIV-1 CA-p24
antibody (D7320, Aalto Bio Reagents) diluted in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate.
Prior to use, plates were blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in TBS followed
by four washes in 1× TBS. Samples and standards (recombinant
HIV-1 CA-p24: Centre for AIDS Reagents) diluted in 0.05% Empigen in
1× TBS were incubated in the plates for 1.5 h, followed by four
washes in 1× TBS and a 1 h incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
anti-HIV-1 CA-p24 mouse monoclonal antibody (BC 1071-AP, Aalto Bio
Reagents) diluted 1:8000 in a solution of 1× TBS containing 2%
fat-free milk powder (Marvel), 0.05% Tween (BDH) and 20% sheep serum
(PAA). Plates were washed four times with 0.1% Tween in PBS, incubated
with Lumiphos Plus (Lumigen) detection reagent, and luminescence levels
were determined using a Glomax luminometer (Promega).

Fluorescence
Melting
Fluorescence melting curves were
recorded on a Roche Lightcycler. Melting curves were acquired using
FQ WT RNA (25 mM NaOAc, pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2)
in the presence of NSC260594 (0–100 μM) with the temperature
ramped from 35 to 95 °C at 0.5 °C min–1.

Circular Dichroism
CD spectra were recorded on a Chirascan
Plus spectropolarimeter (Applied Biosciences). Spectra were acquired
using a WT-3 oligonucleotide sample at 5 μM (25 mM NaOAc, pH
6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) using an accumulation of two
scans from 320 to 190 nm using a 0.1 cm cell, a resolution of 0.1
nm, bandwidth of 1.0 nm, sensitivity of 2 mdeg, response of 2 s, and
a scan speed of 50 nm min–1. Titration experiments
with an increasing concentration of NSC260594 were performed by adding
an increasing amount of a 1 mM aqueous solution.

1H NMR Spectroscopy
NMR spectra were recorded
at 278 K using a 500 MHz Bruker Avance TCI spectrometer equipped with
a cryogenic TCI ATM probe. Water suppression was achieved using excitation
sculpting. Spectra were acquired using a WT-3 oligonucleotide sample
at 100 μM strand concentration in NMR buffer: 5 mM PBS (pH 7.0
or 5.0), 25 mM NaCl supplemented with 10% D2O. The samples
were heat cycled by equilibrating at 60 °C, then at 85 °C,
and again at 60 °C for a few minutes to ensure hairpin formation.
The samples were then kept at 4 °C. Titration experiments with
an increasing concentration of the small molecules (NSC260594 and
ellipticine) were performed by adding an increasing amount of a 1
mM aqueous solution of the small molecules.
