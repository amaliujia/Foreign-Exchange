The family
of terpenoid natural
products, which includes steroids and carotenoids, contains more than
70000 unique compounds that have been identified to date [Dictionary
of Natural Products (http://dnp.chemnetbase.com)]. This
vast chemodiversity belies relatively simple roots in just two fundamental
isoprenoid building blocks, the C5 compounds dimethylallyl
diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate., These simple
universal precursors can be coupled in head-to-tail fashion to generate
longer acyclic isoprenoids such as geranyl diphosphate (C10), farnesyl diphosphate (C15), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate
(C20),, which in turn are substrates for
terpenoid cyclases. While the specific mechanism of isoprenoid diphosphate
cyclization varies from one cyclase to another, common mechanistic
features include initial ionization of the allylic diphosphate substrate
followed by a complex reaction sequence that proceeds through electrophilic
attack on the internal double bonds involving multiple carbocation
intermediates.−

Product chemodiversity for an individual terpenoid cyclase
is a
measure of its function as a template and chaperone. A terpenoid cyclase
such as aristolochene synthase from Aspergillus terreus can be a strict chaperone and generate a single product with high
fidelity. Alternatively, a terpenoid
cyclase can serve as a more permissive chaperone and allow for multiple
cyclization cascades leading to complex product mixtures. For example,
γ-humulene synthase from Abies grandis generates
52 different sesquiterpene products from the substrate farnesyl diphosphate. Thus, the catalytic activity of a terpenoid
cyclase is described not only by its reaction kinetics but also by
the number and structural diversity of the reaction products it generates.

The structural basis of fidelity and promiscuity in terpenoid cyclase
reactions, particularly with regard to the code that relates the three-dimensional
contour of an active site template with its cyclization product array,
is a topic of intense interest in the field of enzyme structure and
function. Recently, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the
sesquiterpene cyclase epi-isozizaene synthase (EIZS)
from Streptomyces coelicolor at 1.6 Å resolution.− EIZS is classified as a class I terpenoid cyclase because it utilizes
a trinuclear magnesium cluster liganded by conserved DDXXD
and NDXXSXXXE motifs to trigger the formation of the initial substrate
carbocation and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Because
EIZS is moderately promiscuous, generating at least five minor sesquiterpene
products in addition to 79% epi-isozizaene from the
universal sesquiterpene substrate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP),, it is an ideal platform for the exploration of fidelity and promiscuity
in a terpenoid cyclization reaction. Minor products generated by an
enzyme may signal potential toeholds for the introduction of new activities
in nature and in the laboratory, and
this perspective applies to the terpenoid cyclases. For example, limited
mutations in the active site contour of γ-humulene synthase
can minimize the formation of several major products and maximize
the formation of a variety of normally minor products. Importantly, residues beyond those that define
the immediate active site contour can also significantly influence
the product ratios of a terpenoid cyclase.

Here, we describe the preparation, assay, and comparison of
26
single-site mutants of EIZS (three of which have been previously described) in which several key aromatic and aliphatic
amino acids comprising the hydrophobic active site contour have been
systematically varied (Figure ). We reasoned
that by leaving intact the residues responsible for triggering initial
substrate ionization (those residues that coordinate to divalent metal
ions and residues that hydrogen bond with the diphosphate group of
FPP), each mutant enzyme would be able to generate an initial allylic
cation from substrate FPP that might possibly be chaperoned through
an alternative reaction sequence because of the remolded active site
contour. We focused on three types of residues: (1) the aromatic triad
of F95, F96, and F198 [the aromatic ring faces of these residues encircle
the active site cavity and engage in cation−π interactions
with a quaternary ammonium analogue, the benzyltriethylammonium cation
(BTAC)]; (2) other aromatic residues
that define the active site contour, W203, W325, and F332; and (3)
aliphatic residues that contribute to the active site contour (L72
and V329) or lie just beneath the solvent-accessible surface of the
contour (A236).

(a) View of the hydrophobic EIZS active site in the wild-type
EIZS–Mg2+3–PPi–BTAC
complex showing
the locations of aromatic residues (red) and aliphatic residues (cyan)
that largely define the active site contour shown in panel b. Portions
of the protein structure in the foreground, including the α-helix
containing W325, V329, and F332, are cut away to allow the active
site to be viewed. Mg2+ ions are shown as magenta spheres.
P and O atoms of the PPi anion are colored orange and red,
respectively. C and N atoms of the BTAC cation are colored green and
blue, respectively. The solvent-accessible surface area contributed
by each residue is given in parentheses. Note that although A236 does
not contribute to the solvent-accessible surface area in the wild-type
enzyme, it is sufficiently close to the surface that substitution
of larger side chains will impact the surface contour.

X-ray crystal structure determinations of selected
mutants confirm
the structure of the remolded active site contour and illuminate the
binding mode of the analogue BTAC. Mutants retain varying levels of
catalytic activity and exhibit altered product profiles; indeed, some
mutants essentially lose the capacity to generate epi-isozizaene and instead generate completely new cyclization products.
Specifically, we have tripled the overall product profile, represented
by the number of characterized major and minor products generated
from substrate FPP. Additionally, we have converted EIZS into six
nominally different sesquiterpene synthases, each of which generates
an alternative sesquiterpene as the predominant product.

Materials and
Methods
Mutagenesis and Kinetic Assays
A total of 23 new single-site
mutants of EIZS were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis.
Mutations were introduced into the wild-type EIZS plasmid using forward
and reverse primers for each mutant as listed in Table . Two optimal conditions for PCR amplification of the insert
were applied: (1) 100 ng of each forward and reverse primer, 3 μL
of 10 mM dNTP mix, 100 ng of template plasmid, 5 μL of Pfu turbo polymerase buffer, and 1 unit of Pfu turbo polymerase diluted with water to a final volume of 50 μL
and (2) 150 ng of each forward and reverse primer, 3 μL of 10
mM dNTP mix, 150 ng of template plasmid, 5 μL of 10× PfuUltra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase buffer, and 1 unit
of PfuUltra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase diluted
with water to a final volume of 50 μL. Optimal PCR conditions
required initial denaturation of the reaction mixture at 95 °C
for 5 min, addition of polymerase followed by 30 cycles (denaturation
for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at primer Tm – 5 or 10 °C, and extension for 7 min at
72 °C), and a final 10 min extension at 72 °C followed by
a final hold at 4 °C. One microliter of DpnI was added to the
PCR mixture and incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h to digest the template.
PCR products were transformed into XL1-Blue cells for DNA isolation
and sequencing. DNA was purified (Qiagen mini-prep kit) from cultures
from single colonies, and DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility,
University of Pennsylvania) confirmed incorporation of the mutations.

Mutant proteins were expressed and purified using
procedures identical
to those previously reported. Steady-state
kinetic parameters for the generation of hydrocarbon products by EIZS
mutants were measured as previously described. Briefly, enzymes were solubilized in 50 mM piperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)
(PIPES) (pH 6.5), 20% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME). Each series of assays was
performed two or three times using 0.025–50 μM [1-3H]FPP (100 mCi/mmol). The optimal concentration of each EIZS
mutant was determined to be that at which the dependence of product
formation on enzyme concentration was linear and the level of substrate
turnover was &lt;10%. A 1 mL reaction mixture in a test tube was overlaid
with 1 mL of hexane immediately after addition of substrate, covered
with aluminum foil, and incubated for 12–15 min at 30 °C.
The reaction was quenched by the addition of 75 μL of 500 mM
EDTA (pH 8.0), and the mixture was vortexed for 20 s. The hexane extract
was passed through a silica gel column (1 cm of silica gel in a Pasteur
pipet) directly into a scintillation vial containing 5 mL of scintillation
fluid. The aqueous phase was extracted with an additional 2 ×
1 mL of hexane and passed through the same silica gel column. Finally,
the column was washed with an additional 1 mL of diethyl ether. A
Beckman scintillation counter was used to measure total product formation,
and the substrate concentration versus rate of product formation data
were fit by nonlinear regression using Prism to determine steady-state
kinetic parameters, kcat and KM, based on the known total enzyme concentration.

Analysis
of Sesquiterpene Product Arrays
FPP (80 μM)
was incubated with 0.8 μM EIZS wild type or each mutant in 6
mL of buffer [50 mM PIPES (pH 6.5), 15 mM MgCl2, 100 mM
NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 5 mM BME] and overlaid with 3 mL of HPLC grade n-pentane in a glass test tube at 30 °C for 18 h. The
reaction mixture was extracted three times with n-pentane; pentane extracts were dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated on an ice/water mixture under reduced
pressure until the volume reached 100 μL. Extracts were analyzed
using an Agilent 5890 Series II mass spectrometer with a 30 m ×
0.25 mm HP5MS capillary column in EI positive mode using a temperature
program with an initial hold at 60 °C for 2 min, a 20 °C/min
temperature gradient from 60 to 280 °C, a final hold at 280 °C
for 2 min, and a solvent delay of 3 min. Analysis of the organic extracts
resulting from the incubation of FPP with the mutant cyclases by gas
chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC–MS) revealed the formation
of mixtures of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons at m/z 204. Compounds were identified by comparison of their
individual mass spectra and chromatographic retention indices with
those of authentic compounds using the MassFinder 4.0 Program and
Database.

X-ray Crystal Structure
Determinations
The L72V, A236G,
W325F, and V329A EIZS mutants were crystallized by the hanging drop
vapor diffusion method using the same conditions employed for crystallization
of the wild-type enzyme. Briefly, a 4
μL drop of a protein solution [8 mg/mL EIZS mutant, 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM
TCEP, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mM BTAC] was added to a 4 μL
drop of precipitant solution [100 mM Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), 25–28%
polyethylene glycol 3350, and 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4] and equilibrated against a 1 mL reservoir of precipitant
solution at room temperature. Crystals of each mutant were isomorphous
with those of the wild-type enzyme (space group P21, a = 53.2 Å, b = 47.4 Å, c = 75.4 Å, β = 95.5°) and diffracted to 1.76–2.30 Å resolution
at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), beamline X-29, or
the Advanced Photon Source (APS), NE-CAT beamline 24-ID-C. Data collection

Crystals of unliganded
wild-type EIZS were prepared by soaking
crystals of the wild-type EIZS–Mg2+3–BTAC
complex in chelation buffer [5 mM 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid, 15 mM tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 100 mM Bis-Tris
(pH 5.5), 30% polyethylene glycol 3350, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 15% glycerol] for 7 days. Crystals diffracted
X-rays to 2.4 Å resolution at NSLS beamline X-29 and were isomorphous
with those of the liganded enzyme. Data
collection statistics are listed in Table .

F95M EIZS was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion
method. A 0.6 μL drop of protein solution [15 mg/mL F95M EIZS,
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mM BTAC] was
added to 0.6 μL of precipitant solution [100 mM Bis-Tris (pH
5.5), 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 25% polyethylene
glycol 3350] and equilibrated against a 110 μL well reservoir
of precipitant solution. Crystals appeared within 1 week. X-ray diffraction
data (2.45 Å resolution) were collected on a Rigaku IV++ image plate area detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200HB rotating anode
X-ray generator (8.048 keV and 1.5406 Å); crystals were isomorphous
with those of the wild-type enzyme. Data
collection statistics are listed in Table .

F95H EIZS was crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion
method. A 0.6 μL drop of protein solution [10 mg/mL F95H EIZS,
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10%
glycerol, 2 mM TCEP, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 2 mM BTAC] was
added to 0.6 μL of precipitant solution (40 mM KH2PO4, 16% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20% glycerol) and
equilibrated against a 110 μL well reservoir of precipitant
solution. Crystals appeared in 1 week and diffracted X-rays to 2.1
Å resolution at NSLS beamline X-29. Crystals belonged to space
group P212121 with
the following unit cell parameters: a = 46.7 Å, b = 75.6 Å, and c = 107.6 Å (one
monomer in the asymmetric unit).

Crystal structures were determined
by molecular replacement using
PHASER;, the atomic coordinates of wild-type EIZS
less ligand and solvent molecules were used as a search probe for
rotation and translation function calculations. Initial electron density
maps of each mutant clearly revealed the substituted amino acid side
chain, which was modeled into density and refined. The initial electron
density map of unliganded EIZS revealed an empty active site. Iterative
cycles of refinement and manual model building were performed with
PHENIX and COOT, respectively., Ligands and water molecules
were included in later cycles of refinement. Individual atomic B factors were utilized in refinement. Data collection and
refinement statistics for each structure are listed in Table . The rmsds of Cα atoms between wild-type
and mutant EIZS complexes were calculated with COOT.

Results
Catalytic
Activity of EIZS Mutants
Steady-state kinetic
parameters for all mutants reflect the generation of 3H-labeled
hexane-extractable products and are reported in Table ; data for the F96A, F198A, and W203F mutants, which were
previously reported by Aaron and colleagues, are included for comparison. In general, KM values for mutants of aromatic and aliphatic active site
residues are within 1 order of magnitude of those measured for wild-type
EIZS. The most significant difference in KM is observed for V329M EIZS, which exhibits a 20-fold higher KM value compared with that of the wild-type
enzyme. More significant changes are observed for the kcat values of various mutants; overall, changes in kcat tend to be greater for replacement of aromatic
residues than for substitution of aliphatic residues. In particular,
substitution of F95, F96, and F198 with smaller aliphatic side chains
results in 11–730-fold decreases in kcat. This aromatic triad encircles the active site (Figure ) and is proposed to stabilize carbocationic transition
states and intermediates through cation−π interactions.

Two tryptophan residues, W203
and W325, although only marginally
exposed to the central active site cavity compared to F95 and F96,
were substituted with phenylalanine to probe the importance of their
aromatic indole side chains. Whereas W203F EIZS exhibits a 250-fold
reduction in kcat compared to that of
wild-type EIZS, W325F EIZS shows only a modest 4-fold reduction in kcat. Thus, W203 has a stronger influence on
catalysis, probably because W203 contributes more surface area to
the active site contour than W325 (Figure ). The F332A mutant exhibits an 800-fold reduction in kcat, consistent with the fact that the edge of this aromatic
residue also defines part of the active site contour.

Substitution
of aliphatic residues L72, V329, and A236 with either
larger or smaller aliphatic side chains appears to be better tolerated,
with kcat values comparable to or within
1 order of magnitude of that measured for the wild-type enzyme (kcat = 0.084 s–1), except for
V329M EIZS, for which kcat is reduced
more than 100-fold to 6.4 × 10–4 s–1. Interestingly, A236M EIZS yields no detectable products, while
A236F EIZS exhibits a nearly 2000-fold reduction in kcat, suggesting that a small side chain at residue 236
is mandatory for efficient catalysis. Accordingly, A236G EIZS exhibits
nearly the same steady-state kinetic parameters as wild-type EIZS.

Sesquiterpene Product Arrays Generated by EIZS Mutants
Sesquiterpene
hydrocarbon mixtures generated by each of the EIZS
mutants were subjected to analysis and quantification by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) (Table ). Sesquiterpene
products identified in these mixtures are shown in Figure . In general, replacement of F95, F96, or F198 in
the aromatic triad compromises the generation of epi-isozizaene (18), generally more so for F96 and F198,
which each contribute more solvent-accessible surface area to the
active site contour than does F95 (Figure ). It appears that the fidelity of epi-isozizaene
formation is most sensitive to substitution of F96, particularly with
smaller aliphatic residues; the F96A, F96V, and F96L mutants generate
&lt;10% epi-isozizaene. Only F96Y EIZS, representing
a nearly isosteric substitution of the aromatic ring of residue 96,
retains the fidelity of epi-isozizaene generation,
in spite of a substantial 2400-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency
(kcat/KM).
It is nonetheless notable that the product distribution can be significantly
reprogrammed by only a single amino acid substitution for each member
of the aromatic triad, often with retention of significant catalytic
activity. For example, the F95M mutation converts EIZS into a predominant
β-acoradiene synthase, generating a mixture consisting of 68%
β-acoradiene (13) and only 32% epi-isozizaene (18), with only a 23-fold reduction in catalytic
efficiency. F95M EIZS is thus directed to make an entirely different
predominant cyclization product with relatively good catalytic efficiency.
Analysis of the biosynthetic manifold (Figure ) suggests that the observed change in product distribution is a
consequence of diversion of the normal cyclization of the homobisabolyl
cation intermediate.

The product numbering is identical to that in Figure . The predominant products of wild-type EIZS and certain EIZS
mutants are highlighted in cyan and blue boxes, respectively, and
side products are highlighted in yellow boxes; product percentages
are listed in Table . For the sake of clarity,
farnesene isomers 2 and 3 generated at low
levels (1%) by wild-type EIZS are not shown, nor is acora-3,5-diene
(14) generated at low levels (2%) by F95V EIZS. With
regard to product stereochemistry, it should be noted that the determination
of the absolute configuration of the (+)-epi-isozizaene
produced by EIZS has been previously reported. Although the absolute configurations of (+)-prezizaene
(16) and (+)-zizaene (17) produced by EIZS
mutants have not been directly determined, they can be provisionally assigned from the natural cyclization
mechanism, because they represent simple late-stage diversions of
the pathway. By contrast, generation of both enantiomers of β-cedrene
(12) has been directly determined for F198L EIZS by direct
chiral GC–MS comparison with authentic standards, as described
in the text. The formation of both (−)- and (+)-12 requires that EIZS or its mutants be capable of generating both
the (7S)- and (7R)-homobisabolyl
cations, as shown. The absolute configurations of the remaining aberrant
sesquiterpene cyclization products have not been determined and are
arbitrarily illustrated for (Z)-α-bisabolene
(5), β-curcumene (6), sesquisabinene
A (7), sesquiphellandrene (8), epi-β-santalene (9), epi-zonarene
(10), (−)-α-cedrene (11), β-acoradiene
(13), and helifolene (15). Formation of
the enantiomers of any of these compounds can readily be accommodated
by simple variations of the mechanistic scheme.

By contrast, replacement of the
phenyl ring with an imidazole group
in F95H EIZS results in the generation of a mixture of 50% β-curcumene
(6) and 44% epi-isozizaene (18), accompanied by only 2% β-acoradiene (13), along
with an additional 4% of two products of unassigned structure. Although
the overall catalytic efficiency is compromised 100-fold in this mutant,
the rigidity and perhaps the polarity of the substituted imidazole
side chain apparently favor early termination of the cyclization cascade
by direct deprotonation of the homobisabolyl cation. This suggests
that F95 plays a key role in stabilizing and directing the chemistry
of this monocyclic intermediate (Figure ).

Similarly, substitution of F198 with the progressively smaller
aliphatic residues leucine, valine, and alanine reduces the proportion
of epi-isozizaene to 24, 10, and 0% of the total
sesquiterpene products, respectively. Notably, F198L EIZS generates
instead 61% β-cedrene (12), of which 80% is (−)-β-cedrene
and 20% is (+)-β-cedrene based on GC–MS comparison with
authentic standards; F198L EIZS also generates 24% epi-isozizaene (18), 14% zizaene (17), and
1% sesquisabinene-A (7). While the catalytic efficiency
of this mutant is 236-fold lower than that of wild-type EIZS, it is
notable that a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to convert
EIZS predominantly into a β-cedrene synthase. Importantly, the
generation of (+)-β-cedrene indicates that synthetic sequences
proceeding through the alternative (7R)-homobisabolyl
enantiomer, rather than the normal (7S)-enantiomer
leading to (−)-β-cedrene and epi-isozizaene
formation, are feasible. The absolute configurations of the remaining
aberrant sesquiterpene cyclization products shown in Figure  have not been determined and are arbitrarily illustrated.

Interestingly, F96V EIZS and W203F EIZS generate 44 and 47% (Z)-γ-bisabolene (4), respectively, as
part of more complex product mixtures containing significantly reduced
proportions of epi-isozizaene (6 and 14%, respectively).
Early termination of the cyclization sequence by elimination of a
proton from the (4R)-bisabolyl cation intermediate
to yield 4 suggests that the steric bulk of each of these
residues, as well as presumed cation−π interactions with
F96, plays a key role in directing the biosynthetic fate of the (4R)-bisabolyl cation.

Finally, the F96W substitution
generates a mixture of 65% zizaene
(17), 9% (3Z,6E)-α-farnesene
(2), and only 3% epi-isozizaene (18), along with 23% of three unidentified sesquiterpene hydrocarbon
products. An increase in steric bulk at residue 96 thus redirects
the cyclization of the (7S)-homobisabolyl cation
to favor attack on the opposite face of the side chain trisubstituted
double bond. By contrast, as previously reported, F96A EIZS, bearing a much smaller, nonaromatic methyl side
chain, generates a mixture containing 70% of the acyclic sesquiterpene
(E)-β-farnesene (1); replacement
of this key aromatic side chain with a methyl group thus results in
the quenching of the initially formed farnesyl cation. While catalytic
efficiency is reduced &gt;800-fold in this mutant relative to that
of
wild-type EIZS, the catalytic efficiency for enzymatic formation of
(E)-β-farnesene by F96A EIZS (kcat/KM = 310 M–1 s–1) is nonetheless only ∼14-fold lower
than that reported for the wild-type wormwood (E)-β-farnesene
synthase (kcat/KM = 4500 M–1 s–1).

Substitutions for the aliphatic residues
L72, A236, and V329 mostly
result in less dramatic changes in the sesquiterpene product spectrum
compared to the changes seen upon replacement of aromatic residues.
All such mutants generate mixtures containing at least 60% epi-isozizaene, with the exception of L72V EIZS, which generates
a mixture of 43% epi-isozizaene (18),
14% zizaene (17), 3% sesquisabinene-A (7), 2% β-cedrene (12), and 38% of an as yet unidentified
sesquiterpene hydrocarbon product. The majority of these aliphatic
mutants generate zizaene in addition to epi-isozizaene,
representing the alternative cyclization stereochemistry for the common
(7S)-homobisabolyl cation intermediate (Figure ). Because the side chains of these aliphatic amino
acids make smaller contributions to the active site contour of wild-type
EIZS, the effects of their replacement may be limited. The overall
catalytic activity and the cyclization fidelity both strongly depend
on the presence of a small residue at position 236, which is normally
buried just beneath the solvent-accessible surface of the active site
contour. Thus, A236G EIZS generates a mixture of 70% epi-isozizaene (18), 2% zizaene (17), and
28% of a mixture of four unidentified sesquiterpenes with a near-normal
catalytic rate, whereas the corresponding A236F EIZS mutant generates
a mixture of 77% epi-isozizaene (18),
15% zizaene (17), and 8% β-cedrene (12) with a nearly 2000-fold reduction in kcat. By contrast, A236M EIZS is completely devoid of activity.

Crystal
Structures of Unliganded EIZS and Selected Mutants
X-ray
crystal structures of unliganded EIZS and selected mutants
were determined at resolutions of 1.76–2.46 Å. The structure
of unliganded EIZS, the first to be determined of the unliganded wild-type
enzyme, reveals an open active site conformation that is essentially
identical to that previously observed in the corresponding unliganded
D99N mutant, with an rmsd of 0.51 Å
for 308 Cα atoms between the two structures. Interestingly,
active site aromatic residue F96 adopts a different conformation in
the unliganded enzymes compared with the structures of all other wild-type
or mutant EIZS enzymes complexed with three Mg2+ ions and
PPi, regardless of whether the carbocation mimic, benzyltriethylammonium
cation (BTAC), is also bound. The change
in the conformation of F96 triggered by the binding of three Mg2+ ions and PPi and consequent full active site
closure corresponds to rotations of ∼105° and ∼10°
about side chain torsion angles χ1 and χ2, respectively (Figure ). Such induced-fit
conformational changes in the active site contour of a terpenoid cyclase
are unusual, but not unprecedented. For example, F578 of bornyl diphosphate
synthase undergoes a significant conformational change upon ligand
binding. Comparisons of high-resolution
unliganded and liganded contours of other terpenoid cyclases, however,
generally reveal conformational changes that reflect rigid-body movements
rather than significant modification of side chain conformations.

shown as magenta spheres. P and O atoms of the PPi anion
are colored orange and red, respectively. C and N atoms of the BTAC
cation are colored green and blue, respectively. Selected active site
residues are labeled. The aromatic side chain of F96 undergoes a significant

site undergoes the transition from a fully open to a fully closed
conformation.

X-ray crystal structures
of Mg2+3–PPi–BTAC complexes
were determined for the L72V, F95M,
F95H, A236G, and V329A mutants of EIZS, while the structure of the
complex with three Mg2+ ions and PPi was determined
for the W325F mutant. Each of these mutants was selected because it
exhibits significant residual catalytic activity [indeed, V329A exhibits
enhanced catalytic activity (see Table )]
and/or interesting differences in the array of resulting sesquiterpene
products compared to the wild-type enzyme (Table ). All of these mutants, except for F95H EIZS, were readily
crystallized under the same conditions as the wild-type protein. In
general, each single-amino acid substitution causes minimal structural
perturbations, with the following rmsds from the structure of the
wild-type EIZS–Mg2+3–PPi complex: L72V, 0.13 Å (340 Cα atoms); F95M, 0.17 Å
(340 Cα atoms); F95H, 0.22 Å (340 Cα atoms); A236G,
0.16 Å (340 Cα atoms); V329A, 0.08 Å (340 Cα
atoms); W325F, 0.18 Å (338 Cα atoms). The binding mode
of the Mg2+3–PPi cluster is
generally unchanged in each mutant, except that the PPi anion rotates slightly in F95M EIZS such that the bridging oxygen
atom moves ∼0.6 Å, and the Mg2+C ion moves ∼1.0–1.5 Å in the F95M and W325F mutants
(Figure ). Thus, site-specific mutations can
be made in the hydrophobic region of the active site without significantly
perturbing neighboring residues, including those that play an important
role in triggering substrate ionization.

(magenta), A236G (orange), and V329A (red) EIZS complexed with three
Mg2+3 ions, PPi, and BTAC, and W325F
EIZS complexed with three Mg2+3 ions and PPi (tan).

The position and orientation
of BTAC are unchanged in A236G EIZS
and V329A EIZS, which still generate epi-isozizaene
as the major sesquiterpene cyclization product [70 and 85%, respectively
(see Table )]. However, BTAC rotates by ∼20°
and moves ∼0.5 Å deeper into the active site of L72V EIZS
as a consequence of the smaller side chain at this position (Figure ). The proportion of epi-isozizaene
generated is reduced to 43% in this mutant. Interestingly, BTAC appears
to be absent from the active site of W325F EIZS, although some uninterpretable
electron density peaks are observed that could correspond to disordered
BTAC; the level of formation of epi-isozizaene generated
by this mutant is reduced to 50%. It thus appears that the movement
or disorder of BTAC in crystalline complexes with EIZS mutants correlates
with a higher potential for alternative cyclization sequences. Possibly,
more authentic mimics of carbocation intermediates in the EIZS-catalyzed
cyclization mechanism, such as (4R)-azabisabolene, which mimics the (4R)-bisabolyl
cation intermediate, would provide an even more sensitive indicator
of the potential for redirected cyclization cascades in EIZS mutants.

Discussion
Active Site Mutations Dramatically Enhance Product Chemodiversity
We have demonstrated that the hydrophobic active site contour of
EIZS can be remolded with single amino acid substitutions to adopt
a predictable, alternative shape based on analysis of three-dimensional
structures of wild-type and mutant enzymes. Furthermore, in a library
of 26 site-specific mutants, we have tripled the overall number of
major and minor characterized products, and we have converted EIZS
into six different sesquiterpene synthases that each generate an alternative
predominant cyclization product or, in one case, an elimination product.
Thus, F96W EIZS is a zizaene synthase, F95H EIZS a β-curcumene
synthase, F95M EIZS a β-acoradiene synthase, F198L EIZS a β-cedrene
synthase, and F96V EIZS and W203F EIZS are (Z)-γ-bisabolene
synthases. F96A EIZS is a simple (E)-β-farnesene
synthase (Table ). New cyclization products
include simple abortive derailment products resulting from direct
quenching of natural carbocationic intermediates, such as the quenching
of the (R)-bisabolyl cation to yield (Z)-α-bisabolene and (Z)-γ-bisabolene,
while other new cyclization products are, in effect, shunt metabolites
resulting from diversion of the natural cyclization cascade and subsequent
quenching of the derived carbocations, such as the alternative reaction
sequences leading to the generation of epi-zonarene
or β-acoradiene.

It is also noteworthy that the experimentally
observed product array of wild-type EIZS can be reconfigured by single-site
mutagenesis to convert a minor product into a major product, and vice
versa, in accord with previous studies of terpenoid cyclases. For
example, we previously reported that F96A EIZS is an (E)-β-farnesene synthase, because (E)-β-farnesene
is the predominant sesquiterpene product (70%); wild-type EIZS generates
only 5% (E)-β-farnesene. By contrast, we now show that F96W EIZS is a zizaene synthase,
because zizaene is the predominant sesquiterpene product (65%) (Table ); wild-type EIZS generates only 9% zizaene. In
the absence of an experimentally determined crystal structure of γ-humulene
synthase, Keasling and colleagues used homology modeling to guide
the mutagenesis of a limited number of active site hydrophobic residues,
similarly remolding the active site to reconfigure the product array. Noel and colleagues demonstrated that terpene
product ratios can also be reconfigured by mutagenesis of residues
remote from the active site, presumably by long-range structural effects
that propagate through the protein scaffolding.

Aromatic Residues Are Hot Spots for Reprogramming
or Reconfiguring
the Cyclization Cascade
Whether the cyclization cascade of
EIZS is reprogrammed to generate entirely new products or whether
the proportions of major and minor products are reconfigured, the
most striking results are obtained when aromatic residues are mutated.
Active site aromatic residues can stabilize carbocation intermediates
through cation−π interactions, as suggested for the side
chains of the aromatic triad of F95, F96, and F198. Additionally, aromatic residues provide significant steric
bulk and hydrophobic surface area as they define the contour of the
active site, which is evident in Figure .

Interestingly, certain product distributions in Table  can be mapped to specific aromatic residues with regard to
their influence on a specific carbocation intermediate. For example,
consider F96A EIZS. The steric bulk and weakly polar nature of the
F96 side chain presumably play a role in stabilizing the farnesyl
cation resulting from the initial ionization of FPP, because F96A
EIZS generates (E)-β-farnesene as an immediate
derailment product. Inspection of Figure  reveals
that the side chain of F96 is located ∼8 Å beneath the
plane defined by Mg2+A, Mg2+B, and Mg2+C. Furthermore, the plane
formed by Mg2+A, Mg2+C, and F96 is approximately perpendicular to that formed by the three
metal ions. We propose that F96 is ideally positioned to interact
with the initial farnesyl cation intermediate through both its steric
bulk and its capacity for cation−π interactions. The
diminished progress along the reaction sequence as the product arrays
of F96Y, F96L, F96V, and F96A are compared suggests that steric bulk
at position 96 is functionally important, presumably for ensuring
the close contact between the C1 and C6 atoms allowing (R)-bisabolyl cation formation.

In another more subtle example,
the partitioning of the (7S)-homobisabolyl cation
intermediate that leads either to
normal formation of epi-isozizaene or to aberrant
formation of zizaene is a function of the folding of the side chain
of this intermediate. The conformation of the (7S)-homobisabolyl cation directs the electrophilic attack on one face
or the other of the trisubstituted double bond of the side chain,
and this conformation is presumably enforced by the three-dimensional
contour of the active site. Mutants that exhibit significant increases
in the level of zizaene formation cluster in the lower region of the
active site where they decrease steric bulk: L72V, W325F, V329M, and
F332A. Although the methionine side chain in V329M EIZS is slightly
longer than the wild-type valine side chain, this substitution reduces
the steric bulk around the Cβ atom of the parent branched valine
side chain. Alternatively, both F96Y EIZS and F96W EIZS also produce
significantly elevated proportions of zizaene. Both mutants retain
the original aromatic character of the wild-type phenylalanine side
chain, and their larger side chains are located on the opposite side
of the active site from the L72/W325/V329/F332 cluster. Thus, the
partitioning of the (7S)-homobisabolyl cation toward
zizaene formation (Figure ) can be favored
either by pulling the intermediate into the void created by smaller
amino acid mutations in the L72/W325/V329/F332 cluster or by pushing
the intermediate toward this cluster by introducing larger amino acids
on the opposite side of the active site. This suggests that the L72/W325/V329/F332
cluster may chaperone the conformation of the prenyl side chain of
the (7S)-homobisabolyl cation to generate the acorenyl
cation leading to epi-isozizaene formation. A model
of the (7S)-homobisabolyl cation bound in the active
site of EIZS shows how the L72/W325/V329/F332 cluster may achieve
this chaperone function (Figure ).

(7S)-homobisabolyl cation bound in
the active site of wild-type EIZS, showing how the L72/W325/V329/F332
cluster could chaperone the precise conformation of the prenyl side
chain that would generate the acorenyl cation leading to epi-isozizaene formation as summarized in Figure .

Finally, the side chains of F95
and F198 are located in the rear
of the active site as viewed in Figure . Substitution
of these residues with smaller side chains other than alanine may
disfavor the 1,2-hydride shift that generates the natural (7S)-homobisabolyl cation intermediate, diverting the reaction
instead to the enantiomeric (7R)-homobisabolyl cation,
which in turn serves as a precursor of β-acoradiene and β-cedrene.
Indeed, of the 61% β-cedrene generated by F198L EIZS, 20% is
(+)-β-cedrene, which is derived from the (7R)-homobisabolyl cation intermediate (Figure ). As a further variation of this pathway branching, F95H EIZS generates
predominantly β-curcumene by direct deprotonation of the homobisabolyl
cation. Whether the (7S)- or (7R)-homobisabolyl cation is formed is presumably a consequence of the
precise folding of the preceding (4R)-bisabolyl cation
enforced by the active site contour. Thus, bulky side chains in the
rear of the active site (as viewed in Figure ) ensure the formation of the natural (7S)-homobisabolyl
cation intermediate that ultimately leads to epi-isozizaene.
Smaller side chains in this region may allow the formation of the
aberrant (7R)-homobisabolyl cation intermediate,
as observed for F198L EIZS.

Product Chemodiversity and Biotechnology
Applications
While numerous studies have been published to
date describing mutagenesis
of class I terpenoid cyclases and resultant changes in products generated,
many of these studies have focused on residues outside of the hydrophobic
active site pocket, such as residues coordinating to catalytically
obligatory metal ions,,− residues that
hydrogen bond with the substrate diphosphate group,, or residues thought to function in general acid–general base
or electrostatic catalysis.,, Relatively few studies have focused on site-specific mutants specifically
prepared to remold the hydrophobic active site contour of a class
I terpenoid cyclase, and fewer still have been explicitly guided or
accompanied by experimentally determined crystal structures.,,− Accordingly, we suggest that
our work with EIZS represents the first small step in a journey that
will ultimately allow us to correlate the three-dimensional structures
of experimentally verified remolded active site contours with reprogrammed
isoprenoid cyclization cascades.

Structure-based reprogramming
of terpenoid cyclase activity should have myriad applications in chemistry,
biology, and biotechnology. For example, given that plant (E)-β-farnesene synthase has been commercialized for
the large-scale production of (E)-β-farnesene
in the development of an aviation biofuel,− it is possible
that a bacterial or fungal sesquiterpene synthase, such as F96A EIZS or the Y92A mutant of aristolochene synthase
from Penicillium roqueforti, could be similarly adapted for large-scale biofuel generation. The
terpenoid cyclase step is typically the bottleneck in microbial biosynthetic
engineering experiments,, and plant sesquiterpene
synthases can be difficult to express in microbial fermentation systems. Thus, the availability of a microbial sesquiterpene
synthase engineered to generate a desired sesquiterpene product may
provide a useful alternative for the microbial production of advanced
biofuels.

It is possible, too, that the use of an engineered
bacterial terpenoid
cyclase could enhance the flux of sesquiterpene generation by virtue
of enhanced catalytic activity relative to that of a naturally occurring
plant enzyme. For example, bisabolane has recently been identified
as a new biosynthetic alternative to D2 diesel fuel, which is utilized
in compression ignition engines. Bisabolane
is generated by hydrogenation of (Z)-α-bisabolene,
which in turn is generated by the three-domain plant sesquiterpene
cyclase, α-bisabolene synthase from Abies grandis, in a microbial expression system (Figure ). The reported catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of this α-bisabolene
synthase is 38 M–1 s–1. However,
bisabolane can also be generated by the hydrogenation of β-curcumene
(Figure ), which is generated by F95H EIZS
with a kcat/KM of 2600 M–1 s–1 (Table ). Thus, the generation of the bisabolane precursor
β-curcumene by F95H EIZS is 68-fold more efficient than the
generation of the bisabolane precursor (Z)-α-bisabolene
by wild-type α-bisabolene synthase. Because no naturally occurring
β-curcumene synthase has been characterized (apart from a grape
sesquiterpene cyclase that generates a mixture of sesquiterpene products,
including 22% β-curcumene), the
reprogrammed catalytic activity of F95H EIZS may allow a more efficient
approach for economical biofuel generation.

D2 diesel fuel substitute
bisabolane can be generated by the hydrogenation
of (Z)-α-bisabolene or β-curcumene. F95H
EIZS exhibits 68-fold enhanced catalytic efficiency in the generation
of β-curcumene compared with the generation of (Z)-α-bisabolene by α-bisabolene synthase, so it is possible
that F95H EIZS could serve as a superior terpenoid synthase for microbial
biofuel generation.

Concluding Remarks
In closing, we
note that the grand
challenge in the engineering of a terpenoid cyclase is predictability:
can a terpenoid cyclase be reprogrammed in true a priori fashion using structure-based design? The reprogrammed cyclization
cascades of EIZS mutants result from divergent mechanistic sequences
that branch from a handful of key carbocation intermediates, such
as the farnesyl cation, the (4R)-bisabolyl cation,
or the (7S)- or (7R)-homobisabolyl
cation. The next step will be to study how the binding of stable analogues
of these common intermediates is affected by active site mutations.
Such an approach will provide the required foundation for predicting
how a carbocation intermediate can be managed and manipulated through
alternative mechanistic sequences. Future work in this regard will
be reported in due course.
