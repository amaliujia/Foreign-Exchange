The origin
of the high stability
of enzymes from thermophilic organisms has been assigned to several
factors that include a shortening of the loops, an increased content of α-helices and β-strands,− extension of the polar surface area,,, reduction of the total surface area through oligomerization, enhanced hydrophobicity, and stronger hydrogen bonding, and salt bridge interactions,,,− as well as an increase in the number of proline residues,, and a reduction in the numbers
of thermally labile asparagine, glutamine, methionine, or cysteine
residues. To design enzymes that can efficiently
catalyze reactions at high temperatures, an improved understanding
of the physical contributors to protein stability is essential.

Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) uses electrons from the cofactor
NADPH to reduce 7,8-dihydrofolate (H2F) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate
(H4F)., Because of its ability to carry
one-carbon units in different oxidation states, the product H4F is central in many biosynthetic pathways such as the de novo synthesis of purine bases, deoxythymidine triphosphate,
several amino acids, including methionine and glycine, and pantothenic
acid in prokaryotes. Recently, a DHFR from the moderate thermophile Geobacillus stearothermophilus (originally named Bacillus stearothermophilus in 1920 but transferred to the genus Geobacillus following
a reclassification in 2001) has been
characterized and examined with respect to its structural and kinetic
adaptation to moderately high temperatures.− It can serve as a good model
for studying the adaptation of thermophilic enzymes to extreme temperatures.

BsDHFR is moderately thermostable with a melting temperature at
67 °C. Like other characterized
DHFRs from mesophilic and psychrophilic organisms, BsDHFR is a monomer
in solution and was the first monomeric DHFR from a thermophilic species
to be characterized. The tertiary structure
of BsDHFR is closely related to that of other chromosomal DHFRs and
aligns well with that of DHFR from the mesophile Escherichia
coli (EcDHFR) (Figure ). The M20
loop of apo-BsDHFR, which forms part of the active site, adopts a
conformation similar to the “closed” M20 loop conformation
in the reactant complexes of EcDHFR. All
elements of secondary structure can be superimposed with the closed
conformation of EcDHFR except for helix E, which in BsDHFR is tilted
20° away from the adenosine binding site. The M20 loop in apo-BsDHFR
does not align well with that of apo-EcDHFR because this loop is disordered
in the latter case.,

structure of apo-BsDHFR
(PDB entry 1ZDR) and (B) overlay of apo-BsDHFR (red)
with the closed conformation of EcDHFR (blue, PDB entry 1RX2). Secondary structural elements are indicated, and ligands
in EcDHFR are shown as sticks.

The features that contribute to the stability of thermophiles
have
previously been discussed on the basis of a comparison of the thermophilic
BsDHFR to mesophilic EcDHFR. It has been suggested that the thermal
stabilization of BsDHFR is due to the extension of α-helices
and β-strands (α-helix E and β-strands B, C, and
E) and the insertion of prolines into loop regions (loops CD and GH). The structural flexibility of BsDHFR has also
been compared with that of EcDHFR. Interestingly, BsDHFR has a rigid
core but appears to display an overall pico- to nanosecond time-scale
flexibility higher than that of EcDHFR., However, the
extent to which each of these factors influences the thermostability
and flexibility of BsDHFR has not yet been addressed.

The amino
acid sequence of BsDHFR is 38% identical with that of
EcDHFR but 44% identical with that of DHFR from the psychrophile Moritella profunda (MpDHFR), although the melting temperature
of MpDHFR is ∼30 °C lower than that of BsDHFR. Hence, the role of individual amino acids in
the thermostability of BsDHFR was investigated here by site-directed
mutagenesis by replacing them with the equivalent residues in MpDHFR.
While apo-BsDHFR denatures at approximately 67 °C,G. stearothermophilus can thrive
at temperatures as high as 75 °C, and additional environmental factors must help maintain the folded
structure of BsDHFR in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All salts and cosolvents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. NADPH was purchased from Melfold. NADPD was synthesized
by enzymatic reduction of NADP+ (Melford) using the alcohol
dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter brockii with d8-2-propanol as the deuteride source. H2F was prepared by dithionite reduction
of folic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The concentrations
of NADPH(D) and H2F were determined spectrophotometrically
using extinction coefficients of 6200 cm–1 M–1 at 339 nm and 28000
cm–1 M–1 at 282 nm, respectively. Synthetic oligonucleotides were
purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
BsDHFR variants were generated
using the Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs)
following the manufacturer’s instruction from a pJGetit-based
vector harboring the gene encoding BsDHFR. The BsDHFR gene was purchased from Epoch Biolabs. Mutagenic primers
for generating BsDHFR-L20M, BsDHFR-A104Q, BsDHFR-P122E, and BsDHFR-P129D
were 5′-GTAAGGATAACCGCATGCCGTGGCACCTGC-3′,
5′-CGCAGAGCTGTTTCGCCAGACCATGCCGATTGTC-3′,
5′-CTAAGATCTTTGCATCTTTCGAAGGGGATACTTTCTATCCAC-3′,
and 5′-GGGGATACTTTCTATCCAGATATTTCTGATGACGAATGG-3′,
respectively (changes underlined). The sequences of BsDHFR variants
were verified by automated DNA sequencing (Molecular Biology Unit,
Cardiff University).

Protein Expression and Purification
For the production
of BsDHFR and its variants, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells
were transformed with the respective plasmid and grown to an OD600 of 0.6 in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL).
Expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were grown overnight
at 30 °C and harvested by centrifugation. Wild-type BsDHFR was
heat-precipitated at 55 °C to remove E. coli proteins. The variants of BsDHFR were not heat treated because of
their lower thermal stability. Supernatant solutions were applied
to SP-Sepharose cation exchange resin pre-equilibrated in 50 mM citrate
buffer (pH 5.0) and then eluted with a NaCl gradient (0 to 1 M) as
described previously, leading to essentially
pure proteins as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically
using an extinction coefficient of 25565 cm–1 M–1 at 280 nm.

Circular Dichroism
(CD) Spectroscopy
CD spectroscopy
was conducted on an Applied PhotoPhysics Chirascan spectrometer. CD
spectra were measured between 200 and 280 nm for enzyme (5 μM)
in degassed potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.0). The observed
ellipticities were converted to mean residue ellipticities (MRE) using
the equation [Θ]MRE = Θ/(10ncl), where Θ is the ellipticity in millidegrees, n is the number of backbone amide bonds, c is the
protein concentration in moles per liter, and l is
the path length in centimeters. CD unfolding measurements were performed
at 208 nm between 4 and 96 °C and spectra recorded in steps of
0.5 °C. The reaction buffer was incubated at each temperature
for 5 min before the measurement of the spectrum. A blank run was
always first performed using the buffer alone (containing the appropriate
concentration of ligand where appropriate). Melting temperatures were
extracted by fitting the data to an appropriate sigmoidal curve using
the spectrometer software.

Kinetic Measurements
All kinetic
experiments at pH
7 were performed in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer containing 100
mM NaCl and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Salt concentrations of
0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 M were used for the salt effect measurements.
Cosolvent concentrations of 17, 33, and 50% were used for cosolvent
effect measurements. The pH was adjusted after the addition of salts
and cosolvents. Details of dielectric constants and viscosities of
solvent mixtures are from ref ().

Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed
on a JASCO V-660 spectrophotometer directly under saturating concentrations
of NADPH (200 μM) and H2F (100 μM). The enzyme
activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm [ε340 (cofactor + substrate) = 11800 M–1 cm–1]. The reaction buffer
was preincubated at the desired temperature, and the temperature in
the cuvette was monitored immediately prior to data acquisition. The
enzyme (20–50 nM) and NADPH (10–400 μM) were incubated
together for 1 min, and the reaction was initiated by addition of
dihydrofolate (1–100 μM). When the concentration of NADPH
was varied, that of H2F was maintained at a saturating
level and vice versa. Initial linear rates of absorbance change were
fit using the software provided (JASCO Corp.). The kinetic parameters kcat and KM were
determined by fitting the change in the observed rate with substrate
or cofactor concentration to the Michaelis–Menten equation
using SigmaPlot 10.

Pre-steady-state kinetic experiments were
performed on a Hi-Tech
Scientific stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Hydride transfer rate constants
were measured by monitoring the fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) from protein to NADPH. The sample was excited at 297 nm and
the emission measured using an output filter with a cutoff at 400
nm. To avoid hysteresis, NADPH was preincubated with DHFR for 5 min
at the desired temperature in a thermostated syringe compartment and
the reaction initiated by rapidly mixing the sample with H2F. Final assay conditions were 20 μM DHFR, 8 μM NADPH(D),
and 100 μM H2F. To analyze the kinetic data, a single-exponential
fit was used.

Results and Discussion
Design of BsDHFR Variants
In contrast to the differing
thermostability, an alignment of BsDHFR, EcDHFR, and MpDHFR reveals
a high degree of sequence conservation, particularly in the N-terminal
region (Figure ). The sequence of BsDHFR is
44 and 38% identical with those of MpDHFR and EcDHFR, respectively.
In particular, many residues participating in binding of the substrate
(Leu28, Phe31, Lys31, and Ile96) and cofactor (Ala7, Ile14, Asn18,
Arg44, Thr46, Ile96, and Gly98) are fully conserved. Interestingly,
the sequence of BsDHFR is more identical to that of the psychrophilic
analogue MpDHFR than to that of EcDHFR. Hydrogen–deuterium
exchange experiments suggested that BsDHFR is more rigid than MpDHFR
at room temperature, especially in the protein core and loop subdomain., The higher rigidity of the loop regions of BsDHFR may be due to
additional proline residues. There are
11 proline residues in BsDHFR and 8 in MpDHFR, 7 of which are conserved.
Two of the nonconserved proline residues in BsDHFR (Pro107 and Pro142)
are in regions of secondary structure (α-helix F and β-strand
G, respectively). The other two, Pro122 and Pro129, can be found in
the FG loop and may contribute to the increased thermostability of
BsDHFR. These residues are substituted with Glu and Asp in MpDHFR
and EcDHFR, respectively. To investigate the influence of proline
residues on the thermostability and catalysis of BsDHFR, variants
BsDHFR-P122E and BsDHFR-P129D were prepared.

Sequence alignment (created
using ClustalW) of BsDHFR, EcDHFR, and
MpDHFR. The asterisks, colons, and periods
below the alignment indicate fully, strongly, and weakly conserved
residues, respectively. Water-accessible thermolabile residues are
highlighted in yellow. Proline residues are highlighted in blue. Red
boxes below the alignment indicate the residues that contact NADPH
in E. coli (PDB entry 1RX2). The secondary
structure is also indicated.

Another factor that may contribute to the thermostability
of BsDHFR
is the presence of fewer thermolabile residues in water-accessible
regions. In a high-temperature environment, asparagine and glutamine
are prone to deamidation and can induce cleavage of the peptide backbone,
whereas methionine and cysteine become more sensitive to oxidation. These amino acids are less common in thermophilic
proteins or are buried within the protein to prevent unwanted reactions. Indeed, BsDHFR and MpDHFR differ in the number
of water-accessible thermolabile residues. Moreover, several residues
involved in the binding of the cofactor are different from those in
MpDHFR. Noticeably, Met20 and Gln104 in MpDHFR, which are conserved
in many DHFRs, are substituted with Leu and Ala in BsDHFR, respectively.
Therefore, variants BsDHFR-L20M and BsDHFR-A104Q were prepared to
investigate the influence of thermolabile residues on the thermostability
and catalysis of BsDHFR.

Conformational Analysis by CD Spectroscopy
Far-UV CD
spectroscopy of BsDHFR showed characteristics of a folded structure
with well-defined secondary structural elements. There is a broad
negative peak at 222–208 nm for BsDHFR (Figure A) with a minimal mean residue ellipticity (MRE) of −6553
deg cm2 dmol–1 at 209 nm. The CD spectra
of all variants had similar shapes and shared a minimum at around
208 nm at 20 °C (Figure A). This suggests
that the secondary structures of the variants are similar to that
of wild-type BsDHFR.

BsDHFR, orange for BsDHFR-L20M, gold for BsDHFR-A104Q, brown for BsDHFR-L20M/A104Q,
dark green for BsDHFR-P122E, teal for P129D, and yellow-green for
BsDHFR-P122E/P129D) at 20 °C, (B) BsDHFR at 20 °C in the
presence of 2 M salts (green denotes no added salt, cyan NaCl, purple
KCl, and blue KF), and (C) BsDHFR at 20 °C in the presence of
50% organic cosolvents [light blue for methanol, dark blue for ethanol,
purple for 2-propanol, red for ethylene glycol, orange for glycerol,
yellow for sucrose (33%), and light green for THF] at pH 7.

The effects of salts and cosolvents
on the secondary structure
were also monitored by CD spectroscopy. Even in the presence of 2
M salts (NaCl, KCl, and KF), no major differences in the shape or
intensity in the protein CD spectrum were observed, suggesting that
in this concentration range Na+, K+, Cl–, and F– ions do not alter the secondary
structure of the protein (Figure B). BsDHFR
can also maintain its secondary structure in most organic cosolvents,
except in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (Figure C).
Some loss of structure was observed in the presence of 50% THF, as
has been seen for EcDHFR and MpDHFR.,

Thermostability
To determine the effect of the mutations,
salts, and cosolvents on the thermal stability of BsDHFR, melting
temperatures were measured by monitoring the change in MRE at 208
nm with increasing temperature (Table ). Tm was determined to be 66.2 ± 0.4 °C
for wild-type, unliganded BsDHFR, which is similar to the value reported
previously. The binding of ligands to
BsDHFR helped stabilize the protein at higher temperatures, while
the melting temperatures of the BsDHFR variants are lower than that
of the wild-type enzyme (Table ). Variants
with thermally labile residues incorporated (BsDHFR-L20M, BsDHFR-A104Q,
and BsDHFR-L20M/A104Q) are slightly more sensitive to thermal destabilization,
showing a 3–5 °C decrease in the melting temperature.
Conversely, proline residues in the loop regions of BsDHFR do not
contribute significantly to the thermal stability, as the melting
temperatures of BsDHFR-P122E, BsDHFR-P129D, and BsDHFR-P122E/P129D
decrease by only 1–2 °C.

The addition of salts
had a stabilizing influence on BsDHFR (Table ). The melting temperature of BsDHFR increased sharply
as the salt concentration increased from 0.1 to 0.5 M and plateaued
at higher concentrations (&gt;0.5 M) (Table ).
Eventually, the enzyme showed maximal stability when the salt concentration
reached 2 M, leading to an ∼8 °C increase in the melting
temperature. Of the cosolvents investigated, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol,
and THF generally showed a destabilizing effect, with THF causing
the greatest decrease in the melting temperature. While ethylene glycol
has little influence on the thermostability of BsDHFR, the melting
temperature increased slightly in the presence of glycerol and sucrose
(Table ). The protective and stabilizing effect
of sugars and polyols against thermal denaturation and/or inactivation
has also been observed in many other enzymes.− These compounds
may partially internalize the surface hydrophobic residues and enhance
hydrophobic interactions in the interior of the protein, allowing
the protein to resist the thermal unfolding process.

Kinetics of BsDHFR and
Variants
To understand how residues
Leu20, Ala104, Pro122, and Pro129 affect BsDHFR catalysis, steady-state
and hydride transfer rate constants were measured. The steady-state
rate constants (kcat) for the reduction
of H2F by NADPH were determined spectrophotometrically
in the presence of excess substrate and cofactor. The kcat for BsDHFR at pH 7 increased in an exponential fashion
up to 65 °C but decreased at higher temperatures because of the
thermal denaturation of the enzyme (Figure A). The kcat for all variants increased
exponentially up to only 55–60 °C. The kcat values of BsDHFR-A104Q, BsDHFR-P122E, BsDHFR-P129D,
and BsDHFR-P122E/P129D are similar to that of wild-type BsDHFR (Table ). However, variants BsDHFR-L20M and BsDHFR-L20M/A104Q
show an almost 2-fold decrease in the steady-state turnover numbers.
In addition, all variants were further characterized by measuring
the Michaelis constants for both NADPH and H2F (Table ). The KM values of
the variants are not markedly different from that of the wild type,
except for those of BsDHFR-A104Q and BsDHFR-L20M/A104Q, which show KM values for NADPH 5-fold lower than for the
wild type. This is not unexpected, as Gln104 in MpDHFR and Gln102
in EcDHFR play a key role in NADPH binding by forming hydrogen bonds
with its adenine moiety. Replacement of Gln104 with alanine in BsDHFR
therefore compromises NADPH binding in favor of improved thermostability.
These results suggest that the A104Q mutation affects binding but
not turnover while the L20M mutation affects turnover but not binding.
A likely explanation is that Leu20 is located in the center of the
ligand binding sites and a slight change in residue size (e.g., replacement
with the slightly longer residue Met) might lead to a subtle distortion
in the active site, which is sufficient to decrease the rate of steady-state
turnover but because of its position does not affect substrate binding.
The presence of Leu20 is therefore beneficial to both thermostability
and catalysis. All the mutations change the activation energy of the
BsDHFR-catalyzed turnover only moderately (Table ), suggesting that the catalytic cycle is not significantly
affected.

The chemical step in BsDHFR and each variant was interrogated using
a stopped-flow experimental setup to measure the rate constant for
hydride transfer (kH). In general, kH in the BsDHFR variants increased exponentially
to approximately 35–40 °C (Figure B). The kH of the wild-type enzyme, in
contrast, increased exponentially to 50 °C. Similar to kcat, the kH values
are much lower in BsDHFR-L20M and BsDHFR-L20M/A104Q, likely because
of the subtle distortion of the active site as discussed above. The
measured hydride transfer rate constants in BsDHFR-A104Q, BsDHFR-P122E,
BsDHFR-P129D, and BsDHFR-P122E/P129D are at least 1 order of magnitude
greater than the steady-state turnover rates at low temperatures (&lt;25
°C), implying that the actual reduction of the substrate is not
the rate-limiting step. As the temperature increases, the chemical
step becomes partially rate-limiting, providing hydride transfer rates
that are only 3–4 times higher than the turnover rates. In
contrast, the chemical step in BsDHFR-L20M and BsDHFR-L20M/A104Q is
partially rate-limiting across the whole temperature range; the hydride
transfer rate constants are only 2–3 times higher than the
steady-state turnover rate. Additionally, the mutation of Leu20 to
methionine leads to an increase in the activation energy (Table ). The kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) on kH were also measured for all the BsDHFR variants.
While the observed KIEs for all the BsDHFR variants decreased slightly,
these mutations did not affect the temperature dependence of the KIE
(Figure C).

Effect of Salt
on BsDHFR Catalysis
NaCl, KCl, and KF
all gave a maximal specific activity of BsDHFR at 0.1 M but showed
inhibitory effects above this concentration (Figure A). The inhibitory effect of KF was strongest. At 1 M NaCl,
the activity of BsDHFR was nearly 80% lower than in buffer without
salt, while the enzyme lost &gt;90% of its initial activity in the
presence
of 2 M NaCl. This effect was also observed for NaCl by Kim et al. In contrast, the hydride transfer rate constant
of BsDHFR was increased significantly by NaCl and KCl across the concentration
range studied at both room temperature and elevated temperature (Figure B), so hydride transfer remained a fast, non-rate-limiting
step in the reaction. The addition of 2 M NaCl increases kH by 267 and 99% at 20 and 40 °C, respectively, while
the effect of KCl is less pronounced; KF causes a slight increase
in kH to ∼1.0 M but a subsequent
decrease in kH above 1.5 M. The three
salts all had little effect on the KIE, which remained constant for
salt concentrations up to 1 M but decreased slightly at concentrations
above 1.5 M. It is not certain whether high-ionic strength buffers
represent the naturally functioning environment of BsDHFR. The optimal
growth NaCl concentration of G. stearothermophilus is relatively low (∼85 mM), but
the effect of molecular crowding within the cell may lead to a relatively
high ionic strength.

Effect of ionic strength on (A) the steady-state rate
constant
of BsDHFR at 20 °C, (B) the pre-steady-state rate constant at
20 °C (left) and 40 °C (right), and (C) the corresponding
KIEs. The buffer was 100 mM KiPO4 (pH 7) in
the presence of NaCl (cyan), KCl (purple), and KF (blue).

Effect of Cosolvent on BsDHFR Catalysis
The kcat at 20 °C and the kH at 20 and 40 °C for the BsDHFR-catalyzed
reaction
were measured in the presence of organic cosolvents (Figure ). Generally, increasing concentrations of cosolvents
led to decreases in both rate constants, but CD spectroscopy showed
that the secondary structure of BsDHFR is maintained (vide
supra). It is therefore likely that the reduction of the
rate constants is not related to solvent-induced structural changes.
Similar to the effect previously observed for MpDHFR, EcDHFR, and DHFR from the
hyperthermophile Thermotoga maritima (TmDHFR), the values of kH and kcat were not reduced in a manner
directly proportional to the medium viscosity but were decreased in
a manner proportional to the dielectric constant. The kH and kcat values decreased
to zero when the dielectric constant of the solvent was less than
∼50. The decrease in kcat and kH with a decreasing dielectric constant can
be interpreted as an indication that the dielectric constant affects
catalysis by influencing the shielding of stabilizing electrostatic
effects within the active site., As has also been observed
for other DHFRs,,, the KIE on both kH and kcat did not change proportionally with the solvent properties.
Although DHFRs with different thermal stabilities show different flexibility
and structural stability in cosolvents, their kinetic behavior in
organic cosolvents is essentially the same. Therefore, as seen for
MpDHFR and EcDHFR, it appears that large-scale, nonlocal motions are not directly
coupled to hydride transfer in BsDHFR.

green denotes no cosolvent, light blue methanol, dark blue ethanol,
purple 2-propanol, red ethylene glycol, orange glycerol, yellow sucrose,
and light green THF. In the case of dielectric constant data, lines
of best fit are shown.

Conclusions
BsDHFR is a moderately thermophilic enzyme.
Its melting temperature
was determined to be 66.2 ± 0.4 °C, and its steady-state
and pre-steady-state rate constants reach maxima around this temperature.
Additional thermostability of BsDHFR can be obtained by the addition
of ligands, salts, or cosolvents such as glycerol and sucrose. It
has been suggested that the thermostability of BsDHFR might be enhanced
by extra proline residues located in loop regions. However, replacing Pro122 and Pro129 in the FG loop with
acidic residues did not significantly affect the melting temperature.
Moreover, there are fewer thermolabile residues, such as methionine,
asparagine, and glutamine, in BsDHFR. Incorporation of thermolabile
methionine or glutamine residues had a stronger effect on the thermostability
of BsDHFR than removal of proline residues. Replacing Leu20 with methionine
caused a 5 °C decrease in the melting temperature of BsDHFR,
while replacing Ala104 with glutamine caused a 3 °C decrease
in the melting temperature but strengthened NADPH binding considerably.

In contrast, the KM for NADPH of TmDHFR
is much lower than those of other DHFRs, indicating very strong NADPH
binding. Because NADPH is quite unstable
at the optimal working temperature of TmDHFR (80 °C), the tight binding of NADPH in the active site
can stabilize both the enzyme and the cofactor. Tight ligand binding
has been observed in various hyperthermophilic enzymes, whose optimal
working temperature is &gt;80 °C.− As NADPH is considerably
more stable at the optimal working temperature of BsDHFR (60 °C),
BsDHFR can compromise its affinity for NADPH in favor of improved
thermostability.

The strategy for thermal adaptation of moderately
thermophilic
BsDHFR is considerably different from that of hyperthermophilic TmDHFR.
The lower limit of the working temperature of BsDHFR in vivo (30 °C) is close to the optimal
working temperature of mesophilic EcDHFR (37 °C), and the catalytic
activity of BsDHFR is comparable to that of EcDHFR, likely because
both enzymes can adopt the closed conformation. In EcDHFR, the ability to adopt the closed conformation
is crucial for catalysis, as it forms an ideal electrostatic and geometric
environment for hydride transfer. On
the other hand, crystallographic studies revealed that TmDHFR can
adopt only an open conformation, because
it forms a highly stable homodimer and the loops corresponding to
those involved in conformational changes in EcDHFR are buried in the
dimer interface instead. This likely prevents an ideal electrostatic
preorganization, as it exposes the active site to solvent molecules,
and makes TmDHFR almost inactive at low temperatures. However, dimerization is the main mechanism by which TmDHFR
achieves its extreme thermostability. In contrast, thermal adaptation of BsDHFR is attained by the removal
of thermolabile residues as well as rigidification of certain parts
of the enzyme (the M20, FG, and GH loops as well as the protein core). We have shown previously that monomerization
of TmDHFR and dimerization of EcDHFR do not give opposite effects
and, therefore, that TmDHFR cannot be considered simply as a dimer
of a monomeric DHFR.

In conclusion,
elongation of secondary structure elements observed
previously and the replacement of water-accessible
thermolabile residues with simple hydrophobic amino acids appear to
be the key contributors to the thermostability of BsDHFR, whereas
the addition of proline residues to loop regions plays only a more
minor role. However, in addition to the intrinsic thermostability
conferred by its amino acid sequence, additional stabilizing factors
such as ligand binding and interactions with salts and/or organic
compounds such as glycerol and sucrose must help BsDHFR achieve the
necessary stability in vivo to function at temperatures
above 70 °C. In general, catalysis by BsDHFR is very similar
to that of other monomeric DHFRs, despite having a melting temperature
more similar to that of TmDHFR than that of MpDHFR, reinforcing TmDHFR’s
position as a special case. It would be interesting to discover at
what temperature dimerization becomes a necessary mechanism for ensuring
stability in hyperthermophilic DHFRs.
