Caspases have a number of conformational
states in the zymogen as well as
the cleaved forms (Figure ). The procaspase
monomer assembles to an inactive dimer either through folding and
assembly, in association with death receptors in the cell, or in the
presence of kosmotropes in vitro.− Depending on the procaspase, the
dimer also forms an active yet uncleaved conformation. In general, caspases are activated by cleavage of the
polypeptide chain in a region that separates the large and small subunits
(intersubunit linker) (see ref () for a review of caspase structures and activation). The
cleaved caspase is found in an inactive zymogen-like form, where the
active sites are not well ordered, as well as a mature, active conformation
with intact active sites. The equilibrium between the apo-caspase
(inactive) and the mature caspase is modulated by binding of substrate
in the active site or by binding of inhibitors in allosteric sites.

Conformational states of caspases. The procaspase monomer
forms
dimers either through folding and assembly, where the dimer is the
most stable form (effector caspases, for example), through interaction
with death receptors (initiator caspases, for example), or through
the action of kosmotropes (sodium citrate, for example). The dimer
of the zymogen contains inactive and active conformations. Cleavage
of the intersubunit linker (red loop) results in the formation of
two active site loops, called L2 and L2′ (see Figure ), colored green and red, respectively, and separation
of the two subunits (large subunit, dark blue; small subunit, light
blue) to form the protomer. In the inactive zymogen-like caspase form,
loop L2′ (green) remains bound in the dimer interface and the
active site loops are disordered. In the active caspase, L2′
interacts with L2 of the opposite protomer and stabilizes the active
conformation. The equilibrium between the active and zymogen-like
caspase is affected by binding of substrate in the active site or
allosteric inhibitor to the dimer interface (or other allosteric sites).
As described here, the mature caspase ensemble also contains an inactive
conformer characterized by an intact substrate-binding pocket and
destabilized helix 3.

All caspases recognize aspartate in the P1 position of the
substrate,
so the design of activity-based inhibitors with specificity for individual
caspases has been particularly challenging. Inhibitors with selectivity
to the various caspases are of interest because of the differential
role of caspases in the development of certain tissues,, the involvement of caspases in neurodegeneration,, and
dysregulation of caspases in cancers., In contrast
to the conserved active site, the dimer interface is
less conserved among the caspase family members and has been shown
to be an allosteric site. Allosteric small
molecules that bind at the dimer interface
of several caspases, including caspase-3, induce large conformational
changes in active site loops, resulting in a zymogen-like conformation
that is inactive (see Figure )., Notably, the substrate-binding loop, called L3 (Figure ), is extended toward solvent rather than forming
a groove
on the protein surface as observed in the active enzyme. Overall,
the data from small molecule allosteric inhibitors suggest that caspase
allostery involves large conformational changes between the canonical
active state, with intact active site loops competent to bind substrate,
and a zymogen-like form with unordered active site loops unable to
bind substrate (Figure ).

(c) Comparison of active site residues F128, M61, F55, H121, and C163
for WT and V266H proteins. For panels b and c, amino acids are colored
yellow for the V266H variant and gray for WT caspase-3.

In contrast to the two-state allosteric model,
we have shown that
the mutation of V266 to histidine in the dimer interface, near the
binding sites for allosteric inhibitors, produces very subtle conformational
changes that nonetheless completely inactivate the enzyme. In the
procaspase, the mutation decreases the rate of dimer assembly, resulting in a hysteresis, although the protein
is fully
dimeric at equilibrium. In the mature caspase, steric clashes with
the bulkier H266 on β-strand 8 disrupt a conserved network of
water molecules and shift the neighboring Y195 (β-strand 7)
toward T140 in helix 3 (Figure )., In wild-type caspase-3, Y195 hydrogen bonds with T140 and with E190
through two water molecules (Figure b, red
spheres). In the V266H variant, the shift in Y195 results in a direct
hydrogen bond with T140. A new water molecule replaces the hydroxyl
group (compared to its position in the wild-type enzyme) to maintain
the hydrogen bonding network with E190 (Figure b, yellow sphere). In addition, a salt bridge between K137 (helix
3) and E190 is disrupted in the V266H variant (Figure b). The presence of H266 results in movements of two surface
β-strands [strands 4 and 5 (Figure a)]
such that F128 (β-strand 4) clashes with M61, which in turn
clashes with the catalytic residue H121 (Figure c). The movement of H121 disrupts hydrogen bonding with active site
loop 1 (called L1), which is mostly disordered in the crystal structure.
Molecular dynamics simulations of caspase-3(V266H) revealed that the
N-terminus of helix 3 transiently rotates into the dimer interface,
causing a distortion of the substrate-binding pocket. These subtle changes led us to suggest that one should
consider caspase-3 conformational dynamics as containing active and
inactive ensembles rather than a single active conformation and a
single inactive conformation as in the two-state allosteric model
(Figure , mature caspase native ensemble).

On the basis of our previous mutational
and structural studies
of the interface allosteric site,− we examined the putative allosteric network to gain
insight into
the inactive ensemble of caspase-3. Here, we describe two main groups
of mutations in the allosteric network. First, we generated a set
of single mutants to introduce steric clashes that mimic the V266
to histidine mutation at regions away from the allosteric interface
(Table , “steric clash” mutants;
Figure b,c). Second, we generated a set of
double mutants in the context of V266H designed to relieve steric
clashes induced by H266. These mutants are predicted to restore activity
in the H266 variant (Table , “restorative”
mutants; Figure b). We also examined the importance
of a salt bridge in helix 3 that is close to the dimer interface but
is absent in the V266H mutant. In this case, we replaced K137 and
E190 with alanine (Table , “salt bridge”
mutants; Figure b). Finally, we examined the
mutation of T140 to valine to probe the importance of hydrogen bonding
on stabilizing helix 3 (Table , “hydrogen
bonding” mutants; Figure b).

We show
that relieving steric clashes in the allosteric network
introduced by the V266 to histidine mutation results in increased
activity. We also show that the “steric clash” mutants
effectively mimic V266H. Surprisingly, however, helix 3 was able to
accommodate phenylalanine at position 140 and gained a new mechanism
to stabilize the helix. Overall, the data from enzyme activity assays,
molecular dynamics simulations, and X-ray crystallography show that
the native ensemble of mature caspase-3 contains a conformation with
a mostly intact substrate-binding pocket but with a destabilized helix
3, which appears to lower activity by distorting two surface β-strands
near the active site.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, Expression, and
Purification
Site-directed
mutagenesis was performed as described previously with plasmids pHC332
(WT caspase-3), pHC33203 [caspase-3(V266H)], and pHC332125 [caspase-3(Y195A)] and the primers
listed
in Table S1 of the . Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were transformed
with each of the plasmids, and proteins were expressed and purified
as previously described.−,,

Crystallization and Data Collection
With the exception
of the T140G variant, caspase-3 variants were crystallized in the
presence of Ac-DEVD-CMK as previously described., In the case of T140G, the protein was crystallized in the presence
of Ac-DEVD-CHO. Most crystals appeared within ∼3 days, although
some took as long as 3 weeks to grow. Cryoprotectants included 20%
PEG 400/80% reservoir
solution, 20% glycerol/80% reservoir solution, 20% MPD/80% reservoir
solution (most successful), or 10% MPD/90% reservoir solution systems.
Data sets were collected, and structures were determined by molecular
replacement using the wild-type caspase-3 structure for initial phasing
(PDB entry 2J30); structural models
were refined using Phenix, as previously described. Of the 17 proteins listed in Table , we report the
structures of all proteins except for the T140M and F55Y variants.
The 15 structures determined were within a 0.3 Å rmsd of wild-type
caspase-3 (Table S2 of the ). A summary of the data collection
and refinement statistics is given in Table S3 of the . We also analyzed the
structures with MolProbity, and the overall
score, clash score, and Ramachandran
percent favored are shown in Table S3 of the . All proteins demonstrated a clash score lower
than 10 with the exception of the Y195F/V266H variant. In that case,
the clashes fall into three categories: alternate side-chain conformations
that impinge on waters associated with the other side-chain conformation,
water molecules that are close to charged side chains, and salt bridges
between side chains.

Results
The Enzyme
Activity of Restorative Mutants Correlates with the
Proximity to H266
Our previous studies of caspase-3(V266H)
suggested that relieving steric clashes introduced by H266 should
return activity to the enzyme. To test
this hypothesis, we introduced mutations at
M61, F128, and Y195 in the context of H266, where each amino acid
was replaced with alanine. Tyrosine 195 was also replaced with phenylalanine
(Table  and Figure ). In addition, we replaced T140 with glycine to introduce a smaller
amino acid into helix 3 and disrupt the hydrogen bond with Y195. In
the V266H variant, M61 clashes with H121
and disrupts hydrogen bonding
between H121 and active site loop 1 (Figure c). Surface β-strands 4 and 5 (see Figure a) are observed to move relative to their positions in wild-type
caspase-3. The movement is exemplified by F128, which forms hydrophobic
contacts with M61 and F55 in wild-type caspase-3 (Figure c). In the V266H variant, F128 moves closer to the
active site, possibly causing M61 to clash with H121. The single mutants
M61A, F128A, T140G, Y195A, and Y195F were designed as controls for
the restorative double mutants, which have those same mutations in
the background of V266H. Data from enzyme activity assays show that
the single mutations have little effect on activity (Figure a and Table ). The activity
of the F128A variant is the lowest of the control mutants, being reduced
15-fold from that of the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, the enzyme
activity of the Y195F variant is very high, ∼75% of the activity
of wild-type caspase-3, demonstrating that the through-water hydrogen
bond with T140 is not critical for stabilizing helix 3.

are listed in Table . (b) Comparison of enzyme
activity relative to distance from H266, measured from α-carbons.
The solid line is present only to show trends in the data.

All double mutants exhibited some level of activity
compared to that of single variant V266H (Figure a), which exhibits activity below the detection limit of the
assay. Both Y195A and Y195F mutants were
made in the
context
of V266H to determine whether the smaller Y195 to alanine mutation
would lead to greater restoration of activity or if it would instead
be a change that was too drastic relative to the more conservative
change of Y195 to phenylalanine (Figure ).
The Y195A/V266H double mutant demonstrated activity &gt;500-fold higher
than that of the Y195F/V266H double mutant, showing that loss of the
bulky aromatic ring increases activity when V266 is also replaced
with histidine. The increase in activity (kcat/KM) was reflected
in both kcat and KM parameters,
where both parameters were similar to those of the wild-type caspase-3
(Table ). Indeed, the Y195 to alanine mutation
was the most successful in restoring activity, with the Y195A/V266H
double mutant having essentially the same activity as the control
Y195A single mutant (Table  and Figure a). In contrast,
the activity of the Y195F/V266H variant was ∼2600 times lower
than that of the wild type, demonstrating that steric clashes introduced
by H266 are not relieved by the conservative change of tyrosine to
phenylalanine
versus tyrosine to alanine. The fact that all of the double
mutants gained activity compared to that of the V266H single mutant
and the fact that the bulkier Y195F has activity lower than that of
the smaller Y195 to alanine substitution again suggest that steric
clashes are the primary cause of allosteric inactivation in the V266H
mutant. We note that, in general, the changes in activity for the
mutants listed in Table  were due to a decrease
in kcat values and that mutations that
introduced
steric clashes also demonstrated increases in KM. At present, the relationship between the allosteric network
and changes in the enzyme catalytic parameters is not known, although
both parameters may be affected by changes in the dynamics of active
site loops 1 and 3 (substrate-binding loop) as described below.

In helix 3, replacing T140 with glycine was not successful in restoring
activity to a significant level in the T140G/V266H double mutant.
In contrast, the single mutation, T140 to glycine, had no effect on
activity compared to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table ), indicating that introducing a glycine into the
N-terminal region of helix 3 does not affect positioning of the helix.
Together, the results for the T140G/V266H and Y195F/V266H double mutants
suggest that the new hydrogen bond between Y195 and T140 in the caspase-3(V266H)
variant (Figure b) is not the cause of the
decreased activity in the mutant.

Further from the dimer interface,
mutations in the active site
of M61 to alanine and F128 to alanine partially restored activity
to the V266H variant (Table  and Figure a). In general, the restoration of activity increased
with proximity to H266 (Figure b). For the
three double mutants (Y195A/V266H, F128A/V266H, and M61A/V266H), the
effectiveness of
the secondary mutation in alleviating steric clashes introduced by
H266 diminishes as the distance from the primary mutation increases.
In addition, the Y195 to phenylalanine mutation, as mentioned above,
is more bulky than the Y195 to alanine mutation, so its restorative
effect is diminished because steric clashes are relieved to a lesser
extent (Figure b). One outlier in the trend
is the T140G/V266H double mutant, which has lower than expected activity.
The data show that the steric clashes introduced by H266 are not alleviated
by mutations at T140 in helix 3.

It is important to note that
the four double mutants with low enzyme
activity were not fully processed during expression and purification
(Figure S1 of the ). In addition, we were unable to fully process the proteins using
granzyme B (data not shown). Thus, the activities shown in Figure  and Table  are likely to
represent only the portion of protein that is cleaved. The determination
of kcat is dependent on protein concentration,
which one assumes to be fully cleaved, so the activity of the cleaved
protein is under-represented and may be higher for these mutants than
what is listed in Table  because the protein
is a mixture of cleaved protein (active) and zymogen (inactive). We
also note that the amount of protein that is processed (Figure S1
of the ) does not
fully account for the low activity of the variants. The activities
of the mutants are 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that
of wild-type caspase-3, indicating
that the population of cleaved protein also has activity lower than
that of the wild-type enzyme.

Restorative Mutants Show
Multiple Conformations of H266
We determined the crystal
structures for the five restorative mutants
as well as the single-mutant controls to greater than 2 Å resolution
(Table S3 of the ). The structures of all control mutants were very similar to that
of wild-type caspase-3, except as noted below, with rmsds of &lt;0.3
Å
for all proteins (Table S2 of the ); however, the structures of the double mutants
showed features of the wild type as well as those of the V266H variant.
Wild-type caspase-3 contains six conserved water molecules that H-bond
to R164 and R164′ across the dimer interface (see the example
in Figure S3a of the ). In the case of double mutant Y195F/V266H, four of the conserved
central waters were displaced by H266 and H266′, the same as
observed in single mutant V266H. The remaining two of the six conserved
waters were replaced by cryoprotectant MPD, which H-bonds to the hydroxyl
of Y197 (Figure a). In addition, H266 is observed
in two conformations for one protomer and a single orientation in
the second protomer. The side chain of H266 is rotated toward Y197
(and faces R164), or it is rotated toward F195. In the active site
of caspase-3(Y195F/V266H), F128 is positioned between that of F128
in the wild-type or V266H structures, and M61 is observed in multiple
conformations that limit clashes with H121 (Figure S2a of the ).

For panels a–f, amino acids are colored yellow for the mutant

black mesh. In panel d, the position of Y197 is compared to that of
caspase-7 with an allosteric inhibitor, DICA, bound (pink, PDB entry 1SHJ).

We performed molecular dynamics simulations for
each of the mutants for a total time of 50 ns. The results for caspase-3(Y195F/V266H)
show that H266 rotates toward F195 (and H266′ rotates toward
F195′) within ∼15 ns, and the histidines remain in that
position for the duration of the simulation. Both E124 and E124′
remain inserted into the interface and interact with R164, while K137
is very dynamic and is positioned toward solvent throughout most of
the simulation. Interestingly, F195 is significantly more mobile than
Y195. With H266 rotated toward F195, the side chain of F195 also rotates
toward β-strand 6, which is not observed for Y195 in wild-type
caspase-3 (compare panels a and b of Figure ). In the active site of caspase-3(Y195F/V266H), H121 rotates toward
C163 within the first ∼15 ns and remains in that position for
the remainder of the simulation. Following the rotation of H121, M61
moves behind H121 (toward solvent) and prevents it from rotating back
toward active site loop 1 (see the example in Figure e). These movements are observed in one of the two active
sites in wild-type caspase-3, where the distance between T62 and H121
fluctuates between ∼6 and ∼9 Å. In the second active
site of wild-type caspase-3, the distance is
constant at ∼3 Å, demonstrating that the hydrogen bond
between T62 and H121 is maintained
during the time course of the simulation. A comparison of the distances
in wild-type caspase-3 and the M61A/V266H double mutant (as an example)
is shown in Figure S7 of the  (panels a and b).

250 ps intervals) of the 50 ns simulation to demonstrate movements
of the amino acids in the dimer interface. (e) Active site residues
for T140G/V266H at time zero (gray) and 29 ns (yellow). (f) Position
of helix 3 at time zero (gray) and 24 ns (yellow).

In contrast to the Y195F variant, the structure
of caspase-3(Y195A/V266H) demonstrates a single orientation for H266
(Figure b), which is observed to orient toward
A195 and away from R164. Likewise, H266′ is oriented toward
A195′ and away from R164′. Like caspase-3(Y195F/V266H),
the six conserved waters are missing from the interface. For this
variant, however, the active site residues more closely resemble their
positions in wild-type caspase-3 versus the V266H variant (Figure
S2b of the ). From
MD simulations, one observes
that H266 does not fluctuate from the original position; that is,
it does not rotate toward R164 (Figure c).
Although the salt bridge between K137 and E190 is observed in the
crystal structure, the MD simulations show that the interactions are
transient, because K137 appears to be dynamic and is exposed to solvent
throughout much of the simulation (data not shown). Also in contrast
to the Y195F variant, the position of H121 mostly remains in close
contact with loop 1, similar to that observed for wild-type caspase-3
(see the example in Figure 7b of the ). As a result, loop 1 is less mobile, and M61 does
not move toward H121.

Although the activity of single mutant
T140G is the same as that
of wild-type caspase-3 (Table  and Figure a), double mutant T140G/V266H regained only modest
activity compared to that of single mutant V266H. As with the other
H266 variants, four of the six central water molecules are displaced
by H266 and two water molecules are replaced by DTT molecules. The
DTTs H-bond with Y197 (Figure c). The side
chain of Y195 is observed in the same position as in the V266H variant,
but in this case, it forms a H-bond with N141 in helix 3 through two
water molecules (see the example in Figure S5b of the ). In addition, the active
site residues align closely with those of wild-type caspase-3 (Figure
S2c of the ). Interestingly,
the side chain of Y197 is observed in two conformations (Figure c). While one conformation is the same as that in
wild-type caspase-3, the second orientation is similar to that observed
upon binding of the allosteric inhibitor DICA (Figure d). In contrast to caspase with
an allosteric inhibitor
bound, however, the substrate-binding loop (L3) is intact in the T140G/V266H
variant, so R164 is intercalated between Y197 and P201, that is, in
the active conformation. In the alternate orientation, Y197 H-bonds
with two water molecules that contribute to a H-bond network in the
“124 loop” (contains E124), including backbone atoms
of I126, E123, C163, and G125 and the side chains of E124 and R164
(data not shown).

Results from MD simulations for the T140G/V266H
double mutant show
that H266 rotates toward Y195, although it appears to fluctuate between
the two conformations (Figure d). Interestingly,
the position of Y197 is similar to that of wild-type caspase-3, so
the second orientation observed in the crystal structure is not observed
in the MD simulations. The side chain of Y195 shows higher mobility
than it does in wild-type caspase-3, similar to that of F195 in the
Y195F/V266H variant (Figure a). In one active
site, the side chain of H121 rotates toward C163, similar to that
described above for the Y195F/V266H variant (Figure e, left panel). Following the rotation of H121, M61 rotates
toward solvent and prevents H121 from rotating back to its starting
position, as described above. In the second active site, H121 remains
in its original position, similar to that observed for wild-type caspase-3
(Figure e, right panel). Importantly, helix
3 is stable in one protomer, but in the second protomer, the N-terminus
of helix 3 rotates toward the dimer interface (Figure f). In this orientation, K137 (helix 3) no longer interacts
with E190 but rather interacts transiently with E124′ across
the dimer interface. In addition, K138 (helix 3) rotates toward E190.
These movements were observed for single mutant V266H, so combining the T140G mutation with H266 does
not prevent
helix 3 from sampling the inactive conformation. Overall, the data
for this double mutant show that the active site H121 catalytic group
can be characterized with intermediate mobility, fluctuating between
two conformations, and helix 3 remains destabilized.

As described
above, the single mutation of F128 to alanine resulted
in a decrease in kcat of ∼15-fold
(Table ). The structure of the F128A variant
demonstrated a dimer
interface (Figure S2c of the ) and active sites (Figure S2d of the ) very close
to those of wild-type caspase-3. We note, however, the presence of
a DTT molecule at the site of the mutation in the single mutant, although
no DTT molecules were observed in the active site of the double mutant.
Overall, there were no major structural perturbations due to the mutation.
MD simulations of the single mutant demonstrate that loop 1 appeared
to
be less mobile than that of wild-type caspase-3 due to replacement
of F128 on β-strand 4. Thus, double mutant F128A/V266H exhibited
activity only ∼20-fold lower than that of the F128A single
variant. The X-ray crystal structure of the double mutant shows that
H266 is observed in two orientations (Figure e), similar to that described for Y195F/V266H (Figure a) and T140G/V266H (Figure c). In
addition, Y195 is observed in the same orientation as in the V266H
single mutant; that is, it H-bonds directly with T140. Interestingly,
Y197 is observed in two orientations, as described above for the T140G/V266H
double mutant (compare panels c and e of Figure ). The second orientation of Y197 has the same H-bonding network
as in T140G/V266H. Like single variant F128A, the active site residues
are not perturbed by the mutation (Figure S2d of the ).

Results from MD simulations
for the double mutant (F128A/V266H)
show that, as described above, H266 moves toward Y195 and remains
in this position throughout the simulation (Figure b). Elsewhere in the dimer interface, E124 remains inserted
and close to R164, so it is not available to interact with K137′
across the interface. In addition, the distance between the hydroxyl
groups of Y195 and T140 fluctuates between 2.5 and 3.3 Å, so
the H-bond appears to be stable. Importantly, helix 3 is also
stable; that is, it does not rotate toward the interface as described
for the T140G/V266H variant (Figure f). Like
the single mutant (F128A), M61 does not block H121 but rather remains
near F55 and A128 (Figure b). For this mutant,
the MD simulations suggest that the presence of F128 on β-strand
4 is important for maintaining optimal flexibility in active site
loop 1. A decreased flexibility in loop 1 may correlate with the decrease
in kcat for the single and double mutants.

sites of M61A/V266H at time zero (gray) and 50 ns (yellow) demonstrate

The M61A single variant displayed enzyme activity
very similar to that of wild-type caspase-3 (Table ), and the structure overlaid very closely with that of wild-type
caspase-3 (Table S2 of the ). At the site of the mutation, the side chain of F128 is observed
to move toward the cavity produced by replacing M61 with alanine (Figure
S3b of the ), while
no other changes are observed in the active site. Like the T140G/V266H
double mutant described above, the M61A/V266H double mutant also had
very low activity (Table ). The crystal structure
of the double mutant shows that the salt bridge between K137 and E190
is intact, as in wild-type caspase-3, and that H266 resides in two
conformations (Figure f), as described above
for Y195F/V266H (Figure a), T140G/V266H (Figure c), and F128A/V266H (Figure e) variants. One observes that Y195 retains the direct H-bond with
T140, as in the V266H single mutant. In addition, F128 moves toward
the cavity generated by the M61 to alanine mutation, as observed in
the M61A single mutant (Figure S2e of the ). Molecular dynamics simulations of the double
mutant show that, as observed in the V266H single mutant, K137 interacts
with E124′
across the dimer interface, and the N-terminus of helix 3 rotates
toward the interface so that K138 interacts with E190 (Figure c). The data show that replacing M61 with alanine
does not relieve the effects of H266 on destabilizing helix 3. Elsewhere
in the interface, the rotation of helix 3 toward the dimer interface
disrupts interactions between Y195 and T140 because T140 rotates toward
the surface, so Y195 is observed to move further toward β-strand
6 (Figure d). In addition, H266 samples both
conformations observed in the crystal structure, in contrast to mutants
described above where H266 rotates toward Y195 and remains in that
position. In one active site, A61 fluctuates toward a solvent-exposed
position behind H121 (Figure e, left panel),
whereas in the second active site, A61 remains in the starting position,
interacting with F55 and F128 (Figure e, right
panel). One striking observation from the MD simulations is that the
movement of helix 3 toward the dimer interface results in an ∼7
Å
decrease in distance between the two active sites. The distance
between loop 1 and loop 1′ decreases from ∼42 to ∼35
Å,
which is due to the rotation of helix 3 and movements of surface
β-strands 4 and 5, as well as both loops, toward the interface.
In wild-type caspase-3, the distance fluctuates between 40 and 42
Å
over the course of the simulation (Figure S7c of the ).

Overall for the restorative
mutants, a destabilized helix 3 was
observed in the V266H single mutant, but no rotation in the helix
was observed in the F128A/V266H, Y195A/V266H, and Y195F/V266H double
mutants. We consider those three mutations to have a stabilizing effect
on helix 3 in the context of H266. The M61A/V266H and T140G/V266H
mutants (which have low activity), on the other hand, showed a destabilized
helix 3 similar to that of the V266H single mutant. Therefore, removal
of steric clashes introduced by H266 and stabilization of helix 3
are correlated with higher activity, whereas retaining the steric
clashes (Y195F/V266H, for example) and destabilization of helix 3
are correlated with lower activity.

Introduced Steric Clashes
Mimic the Inactive V266H Mutant and
Have Activity That Is Decreased Relative to That of the Wild-Type
Enzyme
We chose two sites in caspase-3, T140 and F55, located
in helix 3 and loop 1, respectively (Figure a), to introduce steric clashes. The rationale for these two sites
is based on the data described above for the restorative mutants.
T140 is located in helix 3 and is close to the region that is destabilized
in the V266H variant (Figure b), while F55
is located in active site loop 1 and forms a hydrophobic cluster with
F128 (β-strand 4) and M61 (loop 1) (Figure c). Our goal was to determine whether steric clashes elsewhere
in the allosteric network could mimic the effects of H266. In this
regard, we examined mutations of T140 to valine, methionine, or phenylalanine
and mutations of F55 to tyrosine or tryptophan. The T140V variant
removes H-bonding ability with Y195, while T140M and T140F increase
the size of the side chain. Likewise, the Y55
mutation introduces a hydroxyl group into the aromatic ring while
the mutation to tryptophan increases the side-chain volume by 38 Å3 compared to that with phenylalanine.

Enzyme activity
assays show that removal of the H-bond with Y195 using the isosteric
side-chain valine to replace T140 decreased activity ∼25-fold
(Table  and Figure a). The effects were not equivalent to those of the Y195F single
mutant described above (1.4-fold decrease), so the presence of V140
may also affect helix 3 in addition to removing the H-bond with Y195.
At present, however, it is not clear from the activity data why mutations
at the two sites are not equivalent. Increasing the size of the side
chain to that of methionine resulted in a ∼200-fold decrease
in activity, while the T140F mutant decreased activity only ∼4-fold.
In the active site, increasing the size of the side chain at position
55 had large effects on activity (Table  and
Figure a). The F55Y variant demonstrated ∼25-fold
lower activity than wild-type caspase-3, and the activity of the F55W
variant was ∼500-fold lower than that of wild-type caspase-3.

The crystal structure of the T140V variant shows that the six conserved
water molecules are present
in the dimer interface, as with wild-type caspase-3 (Figure a). The side chain of Y195 is shifted somewhat toward
helix 3, but it is closer to the position observed in wild-type caspase-3
than that of the V266H variant. At the site of the mutation, helix
3 overlays well with the comparable helix in wild-type caspase-3.
The salt bridge between K137 and E190 is intact, but a through-water
H-bond between Y195 and T140 is missing in the mutant (data not shown).
In the active site, the side chain of M61 is rotated so that the terminal
CH3 is oriented toward solvent, but F128, F55, H121, and
C163 overlay well with the wild-type active site (Figure b). Molecular dynamics simulations of this mutant
show that K137 is very mobile on one side of the interface, while
K137′ is less mobile and remains close to E190 for longer times
(data not shown). Helix 3 is less stable than observed in wild-type
caspase-3 but does not fully undergo the transition to the inactive
conformation (Figure c). Although K137 interacts
with the carbonyl of P201′ across the interface and K138 rotates
toward E190, the movements are transient such that the helical structure
is mostly favored. During the helix fluctuation, the side chain of
Y195 rotates approximately 90°, although
the hydroxyl retains its orientation toward helix 3 (Figure d).

The structure of the T140F variant shows that
the dimer interface overlays very closely with that of wild-type caspase-3
(Figure S6a of the ), and five of the six conserved water molecules are retained in
this variant (Figure e). Interestingly, the
side chain of F140 fills a cavity at the base of the dimer interface,
without causing movements in surrounding amino acids, and interacts
with Y195 through π-stacking interactions (Figure e). Molecular dynamics simulations also show little movement
in the interface or at the site of the mutation (Figure S6b of the ). Importantly, helix 3
remains in the position of the active conformation. In the active
site, F128 moves closer to M61, which is oriented
toward solvent as described above for the T140V variant (Figure f). In addition,
H121 remains positioned toward loop 1, but the side chain is rotated
approximately 90°. MD simulations show that, in one
active site, M61 rotates toward solvent even though H121 remains in
the orientation that faces loop 1. In the second active site, however,
H121 also rotates to face C163 (Figure S6c of the ). We also note that C163 is quite dynamic
in both active sites and fluctuates between orientations close to
substrate and facing loop 2 (Figure S6c of the ).

The enzyme activity data showed
that increasing the size of the
side chain at position 55 in loop 1 correlated with a decrease in
activity (Table ). Unfortunately, we are unable
to report the structure of the F55Y variant, but we determined the
structure of F55W to 1.9 Å resolution (Table S3 of the ). The active site groups
overlay well with those of wild-type caspase-3
with the exception of M61, which is displaced because of the large
tryptophan side chain. In addition, the indole nitrogen forms a new
H-bond with the carbonyl of G129, which resides on a turn between
β-strands 4 and 5 (Figure a). While
the electron density is good for W55 in both active sites, several
residues in loop 1 (H56–T62) are disordered in one active site,
indicating that the H-bond between the catalytic H121 and the backbone
carbonyl of T62 is disrupted (Figure b). In
the interface, the six conserved water molecules are present in the
mutant, and the interface overlays very closely with that of wild-type
caspase-3 (Figure S6d of the ). MD simulations of the F55W variant show that the H-bond between
W55 and G129 is maintained throughout the simulation, resulting in
a lower mobility of M61 (Figure c). In one
active site, the side chain of H121 rotates toward C163, as described
above for other mutants (Figure c, left panel).
In the second active site, however, H121 remains H-bonded to the carbonyl
of T62 in loop 1; that is, it does not rotate toward C163 (Figure c, right panel). In both active sites, M61 remains
in close contact with the hydrophobic cluster of F128 and W55 (Figure C). Finally, there are no major changes in the dimer
interface (Figure S6d of the ), and helix 3 remains stable, as shown by the lack of rotation in
K137 and K138 (Figure d).

a lack of electron density (black mesh) in active site 1 shows disorder
in several residues of loop 1 (left), whereas the loop is well ordered
in the second active site (right). MD simulations show movements in
the active site residues (c) and helix 3 (d) of F55W. (e and f) Comparison

yellow for the mutant and gray for WT caspase-3. For panels c, d,
and f, 200 frames (at 250 ps intervals) of the 50 ns simulations are
shown to demonstrate movements of the amino acids.

Overall, the steric clash mutants show that one
can effectively mimic the effects of H266 by introducing steric clashes
at other sites in the allosteric network. The data further support
the notion that the stability of helix 3 is important for maintaining
the active state within the native ensemble. Likewise, the mobility
of loop 1, possibly in combination with maintaining the H-bond between
H121 and T62, appears to affect activity, particularly with regard
to movement of M61 to a solvent-exposed position when H121 rotates
toward C163. Either destabilizing helix 3, changing the mobility of
loop 1, or both results in a decrease in activity.

The K137–E190
Salt Bridge Is Transient and Has No Effect
on Activity
The E190A and K137A mutants were designed to
test the importance of a salt bridge between K137 in helix 3 and E190
in the dimer interface (Figure b). Although
this salt bridge is present in wild-type caspase-3, it is disrupted
in the inactive V266H mutant, where K137 is exposed to solvent. This movement of K137 is likely due to distortion
of
the N-terminus of helix 3, as described above. On the basis of the
structure of the V266H variant, we suggested that the movement of
K137 could affect residues across the interface to destabilize the
L2–L2′ loop bundle, which has been shown to stabilize
the active site. Unexpectedly, both the
E190A and K137A mutants had full
enzymatic activity (Figure a and Table ), demonstrating that the salt bridge between E190
and K137 is unnecessary for catalysis.

The structures of the
E190A and K137A variants differ very little from that of wild-type
caspase-3, where one observes that the interfaces (Figure S6e of the ) and the active sites
(Figure S6f of the ) overlay very closely with those of wild-type caspase-3. A new water
molecule is in place of the side chains in both variants (Figure e), and the remaining hydrogen bonding network connects
N141 of helix 3 to E190. The molecular dynamics simulations for all
of the mutants described above show that the salt bridge between K137
and E190 is transient, which is consistent with the observation that
mutating either of the residues does not decrease the activity of
the enzyme. The crystal structure of the E190A variant shows that
Y195 retains a direct H-bond with T140 of helix 3 (Figure e, right panel), and MD simulations show that the
distance between the hydroxyl of Y195 and T140 fluctuates between
2.8 and 4.1 Å. Importantly, helix 3 is stable in both mutants.
Overall, the data
for the K137A and E190A variants show that removing the salt bridge
results in localized changes in the structure that have no effect
on the interface, helix 3, or the active sites, so there is no decrease
in enzyme activity.

Discussion
We have shown that mutations
in the context of H266 restore activity
by relieving steric clashes caused by placing a histidine in the center
of the dimer interface. The secondary mutations are most effective
when placed close to H266. Structural studies show that the mutations
affect the position of H266, which rotates toward either Y197 or Y195,
on opposite ends of β-strand 8. The data are consistent with
our previous studies in which we showed that replacing E124 with alanine
(E124A/V266H) also resulted in two conformations of H266. Molecular dynamics simulations of the mutants
show that
the orientation of H266 toward Y195 predominates (see Figure c, for example), possibly because Y195 has greater
mobility in the cavity than does Y197 and thus can more easily accommodate
the bulky histidine residue. The mobility of Y195 within the allosteric
site has been described previously.

The movement of the N-terminus of helix 3 toward the dimer interface
is characterized by an apparent rigid-body translation and rotation
toward the dimer interface, effectively decreasing the volume of the
central cavity of the dimer interface by ∼800 Å3 (from 1750 to 950 Å3). In addition, the mobility of active site loop 1 is increased
in caspase-3(V266H), and the S1′ binding pocket is narrower.
The restorative mutants in the context of H266 stabilize helix 3 such
that the native helix is favored over the inactive state. Furthermore,
molecular dynamics simulations showed that mutations closest to H266,
such as Y195A, had the greatest effects on preventing the rotation
of helix 3. In contrast, mutations at greater distances, for example,
M61A, were less effective in influencing the position of helix 3.
The data are consistent with the notion that helix 3 samples two conformations
within the native ensemble. In the active conformer, helix 3 is fully
formed, while in the inactive conformer, the amino terminus of helix
3 rotates toward the dimer interface, resulting in a shorter distance
between the two active sites and a smaller cavity in the dimer interface.
The activity of the enzyme reflects the relative population of each
conformation within the native ensemble.

The steric clash mutants
decreased activity by either affecting
the position of helix 3, affecting the mobility of loop 1, or both.
For example, increasing the size of the side chain at position 55
in active site loop 1 from phenylalanine to tyrosine to tryptophan
results in a progressive decrease in enzyme activity. Although we
were unable to report the crystal structure of the F55Y variant, the
structure of F55W shows a new hydrogen bond with β-strand 4,
and MD simulations show that the H-bond is stable throughout the simulation,
resulting in a lower mobility of loop 1.

A consistent theme
in the caspase-3 mutants described here is the
transient rotation of the catalytic H121 toward C163. Along with this
rotation, M61, and loop 1 in general, rotates toward active site loop
4. The movement results in positioning M61 toward solvent, which prevents
H121 from returning to its starting position, that is, hydrogen-bonded
with T62. We note that the conformations of H121 and of M61 shown
in our MD simulations were also observed in structural studies of
caspase-3 bound to the pentapeptide inhibitor, Ac-LDESD-CHO (Figure ). Weber and colleagues showed crystallographic
evidence of M61 rotated toward solvent, where M61 occupies the position of H121 if it were H-bonded
to T62. Thus, H121 cannot rotate toward T62 unless M61 rotates toward
the hydrophobic cluster of F55 and F128. The movements of H121 have
been suggested to be important for the catalytic mechanism of caspases, and our data suggest that the movement is coordinated
with mobility in loop 1. The data from MD simulations presented here
for the allosteric mutants at positions 55 and 128 show a change in
mobility of active site loop 1, suggesting that the loop dynamics
are critical for maximal enzyme activity. Changing the mobility of
loop 1, either increasing or decreasing mobility, results in a lower
activity. The conclusions are consistent with structural studies of
other caspases, where it is well-known that caspases are inhibited
through conformational changes in loop
1. For example, in the zymogen of caspase-8, loop 1 is locked in the
active site cleft through interactions with the intersubunit linker. A similar orientation was suggested for caspase-3
inhibited
by calbindin-D28K, where two helices in the EF-hand 1 region lock
loop 1 in the substrate-binding cleft. Likewise, high mobility is suggested by the disorder
of loop 1 in recently described structures of procaspase-3.

Comparison of the positions of H121 and M61 in wild-type
caspase-3.
X-ray crystal structures of wild-type caspase-3 with Ac-DEVD-CMK inhibitor
(gray) (PDB entry 2J30) or Ac-LDESD-CHO inhibitor (yellow) (PDB entry 3EDQ). The structure
with a pentapeptide inhibitor demonstrates two positions for H121
in both active sites. In addition, in active site 1, M61 is positioned
toward solvent and blocks rotation of H121 toward loop 1. In active
site 2, M61 retains contacts with the hydrophobic cluster of F55 and
F128. Similar conformations are observed for M61 and H121 in molecular
dynamics simulations of caspase-3 variants, as described in the text.

Mutations in helix 3 showed that
the new H-bond between T140 and
Y195 observed in caspase-3(V266H) is not the cause of inactivation.
We removed the hydrogen bonding potential of T140 and of Y195, and
the T140G/V266H and Y195F/V266H mutants remained inactive. In both
cases, helix 3 remained destabilized. Removing the hydroxyl group
of T140 also resulted in a destabilized helix 3. For example, the
T140V
single mutant demonstrated a 25-fold decrease in activity, and MD
simulations showed that, while the native helix was favored, the inactive
conformation was sampled by the variant. Although we were unable to
determine the crystal structure of the T140M variant, we infer that
the low activity of the mutant is also due
to increased mobility in helix 3. Thus, removing the hydroxyl group
of T140 appears to lower the free energy barrier between the fully
formed (active) and rotated (inactive) helix, and the lower enzyme
activity reflects the increase in the extent of sampling of the inactive
conformation. We previously showed that a double mutant in the allosteric
site, E124A/Y197C, resulted in a decreased activity and a destabilized
helix 3, which is consistent with the
effects on helix 3 described
here. Collectively, our data show that sites other than V266 can induce
similar effects by destabilizing helix 3, affecting the mobility of
loop 1, or both.

Helix 3 has been shown to be important in allosteric
regulation
of other caspases. In caspase-6, for example, the binding of zinc
to an allosteric site results in an extended conformation of helix
3, where β-strands 4 and 5 undergo a sheet-to-helix transition. The extended helix 3 also affects the positions
of the
adjacent helix 2 and active site loop 1, so the enzyme is catalytically
inactive. Furthermore, at the C-terminal end of helix 3, in a loop
connecting the helix to β-strand 6, S150 is phosphorylated by
p38-MAPK, an event reported to inhibit caspase-3 and prevent Fas-mediated
apoptosis in neutrophils. The site is
also conserved in caspase-8. Similarly,
caspase-6 is phosphorylated by ARK5 at S257,
resulting in a zymogen-like structure., On the basis
of our data for allosteric regulation of caspase-3,
particularly the role of helix 3 in allostery, we speculate that phosphorylation
of the loop C-terminal to helix 3 destabilizes the helix in a manner
described here for the caspase-3 variants.

Studies of caspase-3
inhibition have focused on activity-based
probes targeting the active site, or on allosteric
inhibitors that bind to the dimer interface and cause a conformational
shift to a structure similar to that of the inactive zymogen, where
the active site loops are disordered (see Figure ). Our data show the presence
of additional inactive conformations
in which the active site remains mostly intact, particularly the substrate-binding
loop, but a region of helix 3 is destabilized and rotates toward the
dimer interface. Targeting the inactive state within the native ensemble
may also provide additional probes for allosteric inhibition. Such
inhibitors would be expected to be highly specific and would depend
on the stability of helix 3 in the various caspases.
