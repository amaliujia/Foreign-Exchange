Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS)
spectrum disorders are characterized
by multiple organ system congenital anomalies that result from mutations
in genes encoding core cohesin proteins SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21, or
proteins that regulate cohesin function such as NIPBL and HDAC8. HDAC8
is the Zn2+-dependent SMC3 deacetylase required for cohesin
recycling during the cell cycle, and 17 different HDAC8 mutants have
been identified to date in children diagnosed with CdLS. As part of
our continuing studies focusing on aberrant HDAC8 function in CdLS,
we now report the preparation and biophysical evaluation of five human
HDAC8 mutants: P91L, G117E, H180R, D233G, and G304R. Additionally,
the double mutants D233G–Y306F and P91L–Y306F were prepared
to enable cocrystallization of intact enzyme–substrate complexes.
X-ray crystal structures of G117E, P91L–Y306F, and D233G–Y306F
HDAC8 mutants reveal that each CdLS mutation causes structural changes
that compromise catalysis and/or thermostability. For example, the
D233G mutation disrupts the D233–K202–S276 hydrogen
bond network, which stabilizes key tertiary structure interactions,
thereby significantly compromising thermostability. Molecular dynamics
simulations of H180R and G304R HDAC8 mutants suggest that the bulky
arginine side chain of each mutant protrudes into the substrate binding
site and also causes active site residue Y306 to fluctuate away from
the position required for substrate activation and catalysis. Significantly,
the catalytic activities of most mutants can be partially or fully
rescued by the activator N-(phenylcarbamothioyl)-benzamide,
suggesting that HDAC8 activators may serve as possible leads in the
therapeutic management of CdLS.

Cornelia
de Lange Syndrome (CdLS)
is a disorder of multiple congenital anomalies diagnosed in approximately
1 in 10 000 births. CdLS is characterized by growth retardation,
intellectual disability, distinctive facial features (synophrys, long
eyelashes, upturned nose, thin downturned lips), limb malformations,
and other organ disorders.1,2 CdLS is characterized
by a broad range of phenotypes; while the classical severe phenotype
is perhaps most recognizable, moderate and mild cases comprise more
subtle phenotypes that can be more challenging to recognize.

CdLS is a cohesinopathy in that the majority of diagnoses have
been linked to genetic defects in proteins that comprise or enable
the function of cohesin, the multiprotein complex that encircles sister
chromatids during the cell cycle. To date, CdLS has been linked to
mutations in genes encoding cohesin subunits SMC1A,3 SMC3,3,4 and RAD21,5,6 the
accessory protein NIPBL,7−9 and the zinc-dependent deacetylase
HDAC8.10−12 Mutations in NIPBL are predominant in classical CdLS
patients and account for about 60% of diagnosed cases, whereas mutations
in the other genes are less frequent (5% for SMC1A, and about 5% for
HDAC8, SMC3, and RAD21 together) and are seen in patients with more
variant phenotypes.

A biological function of the cohesin complex
and its mediators
is to ensure sister chromatid cohesion during the cell cycle. It is
also centrally involved in other important cellular processes, including
DNA repair and gene expression.13,14 Four proteins, SMC1A,
SMC3, RAD21, and STAG, assemble to form the cohesin complex with a
ring-like quaternary structure.14,15 The SMC1A and SMC3
subunits have similar topology: each contains a long, antiparallel
coiled-coil with a “hinge” domain at one end and an
ATPase domain at the other end. SMC1A and SMC3 assemble as a heterodimer
through hinge–hinge and ATPase–ATPase domain interactions.
The resulting cohesin ring is further stabilized by the binding of
RAD21 to the ATPase domains of SMC1A and SMC3. Finally, STAG binds
to RAD21 to complete the complex. Accordingly, SMC1A and SMC3 are
analogous to the two halves of a hinged bangle bracelet, and the STAG–RAD21
complex is analogous to the clasp that locks the bracelet shut. The
cohesin complex is believed to encircle sister chromatids via its
ring-like structure.14−16

The loading of chromatin onto the cohesin complex
is promoted by
NIPBL during G1 phase.14,16 However, chromatin entrapment
inside the cohesin ring is still reversible during this stage of the
cell cycle. After DNA replication during S phase, the acetylation
of SMC3 is essential for promoting sister chromatid cohesion.17−20 SMC3 acetylation at two conserved lysine residues (K105 and K106
in human SMC3) is catalyzed by the N-acetyltransferases ESCO1 and
ESCO2.17 During prophase, most of the cohesin
is released from the sister chromatids. The remaining cohesin localized
at centromeres is further cleaved by separase during anaphase. This
allows for the complete dissolution of the cohesin complex and separation
of sister chromatids.14,16,21

In order to recycle the cohesin complex for reuse during the
next
cell cycle, the acetylated lysines of SMC3 must be deacetylated after
dissolution of the cohesin complex. The deacetylation of SMC3 is catalyzed
by the Zn2+-dependent deacetylase Hos1 in yeast.22,23 Its human ortholog, histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8), was recently
identified as the SMC3 deacetylase by Deardorff and colleagues.10 Several patients with features overlapping CdLS
have been diagnosed with missense or nonsense mutations in HDAC8: to date, 17 missense mutations have been identified
that cause partial or complete loss of deacetylase activity (Figure 1).10−12

Figure 1 A total of 17 missense
mutations in HDAC8 have been identified
to date in children diagnosed with Cornelia de Lange Syndrome. Mutations
(red) are mapped onto the structure of the Y306F HDAC8–substrate
complex (PDB accession code 2V5W; note that the Y240N mutation is accompanied by the
deletion of K239). The bound substrate, Ac-Arg-His-Lys(Ac)-Lys(Ac)-aminomethylcoumarin,
is a gray stick-figure, and the active site Zn2+ ion is
a dark blue sphere. Monovalent cations required for structural stabilization
and regulation of catalytic activity are shown as orange and green
spheres. Purple and cyan segments indicate the flexible L1 and L2
loops, respectively, which can undergo conformational changes to accommodate
substrate and inhibitor binding.

HDAC8 is a class I metal-dependent histone deacetylase24−26 that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the acetyllysine side chain to
form free lysine and acetate; notably, HDAC8 can utilize histone and
nonhistone substrates.10,27,28 Active site residues important for HDAC8 catalysis include D178,
H180, and D267, which coordinate to the catalytically obligatory Zn2+ ion;29,30 tandem histidine residues H142
and H143, which serve as electrostatic catalyst and general base-general
acid, respectively;31,32 and Y306, which donates a hydrogen
bond to the scissile carbonyl group in the enzyme–substrate
complex, thereby assisting the Zn2+ ion in orienting and
polarizing the carbonyl for nucleophilic attack by Zn2+-bound solvent.31,33 A summary of the HDAC8 catalytic
mechanism is shown in Figure 2.26,27

Figure 2 Summary of the HDAC8 mechanism. Coordination
to Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding with Y306 activates the scissile
carbonyl of
acetyllysine for nucleophilic attack by a Zn2+-bound water
molecule with the assistance of general base H143. Electrostatic stabilization
of the resulting tetrahedral intermediate is achieved by Zn2+ and H142. Proton donation to the leaving amino group by H143 enables
collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate to form free lysine and acetate.

Recently, we reported X-ray crystal
structures of five missense
mutants of HDAC8 identified in children diagnosed with CdLS, showing
how individual amino acid substitutions 8–25 Å away from
the active site can trigger local conformational changes that impair
catalytic activity and thermostability.34 Here, we extend this analysis with the characterization of five
additional HDAC8 mutants using X-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics
(MD), and measurements of catalytic activity and thermostability.
Specifically, we report the X-ray crystal structures of G117E HDAC8
complexed with an inhibitor, and the double mutants P91L–Y306F
HDAC8 and D233G–Y306F HDAC8 complexed with a substrate (the
Y306F mutation deactivates catalysis to enable cocrystallization with
an intact acetyllysine substrate). Although HDAC8 mutants H180R and
G304R were not amenable to crystallization, the structural consequences
of these substitutions were evaluated in MD simulations. Interestingly,
compromised catalytic activity in three of these mutants can be partially
or fully rescued by a small molecule activator,35 as previously demonstrated for other CdLS HDAC8 mutants,34 suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy
for managing CdLS in children diagnosed with HDAC8 mutations.

Methods
Reagents
Most chemicals used for buffers or crystallization
were purchased from Fisher or Sigma, unless otherwise specified. The
HDAC inhibitors 4-(dimethylamino)-N-[7-(hydroxyamino)-7-oxoheptyl]benzamide
(M344) and trichostatin A (TSA) were obtained from Sigma and Cayman
Chemical, respectively. The HDAC8 activator N-(phenylcarbamothioyl)benzamide
was purchased from Oakwood Products, Inc. Inhibitor and activator
compounds were used without any further purification.

Expression
and Purification of HDAC8 Mutants
The P91L,
G117E, H180R, D233G, G304R, and Y306F mutations were introduced into
the HDAC8–6His–pET20b construct31 using standard protocols outlined in the Quickchange site directed-mutagenesis
kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Forward and reverse primers used
for PCR mutagenesis are listed in Table S1. Incorporation of desired mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Recombinant HDAC8 mutants P91L, P91L–Y306F, G117E, H180R, D233G,
D233G–Y306F, and G304R were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells according to a previously published
procedure,34 with minor modifications.
Briefly, 50 mL cultures (Lysogeny Broth (LB) media supplemented with
100 μg/mL ampicillin) were grown overnight and used to inoculate
1-L flasks (minimal media supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin).
Typically, 6 L were expressed for each mutant, except for G117E (12
L). Cells were grown at 37 °C until OD600 reach approximately
0.5, at which point the temperature was lowered to 18 °C, except
for G117E (16 °C). After 30 min, cells were induced by the addition
of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mM final
concentration for each mutant, except for G117E (0.1 mM)) and ZnCl2 (100 μM final concentration), and grown overnight at
18 °C, except for G117E (16 °C). Cells were pelleted by
centrifugation and kept at −80 °C until purification.
HDAC8 mutants were purified according to a previously described protocol.34 The protein was concentrated to 7–15
mg/mL. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance
at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient ε = 50 240
M–1 cm–1 for all the single
mutants, and ε = 48 960 M–1 cm–1 for all the double mutants.36

Enzyme Activity Assays
The catalytic activities of
HDAC8 mutants was measured using the Fluor-de-Lys tetrapeptide assay
substrate Ac-Arg-His-Lys(Ac)-Lys(Ac)-aminomethylcoumarin (BML-KI178-0005,
Enzo Life Sciences). Deacetylation of the substrate by HDAC8 is followed
by the cleavage of the amide bond linking the C-terminal 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin
to the peptide backbone by a protease developer, resulting in a fluorescence
shift. Activity assays were run at 25 °C in assay buffer [25
mM Tris (pH 8.2), 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl2] and contained 150 μM tetrapeptide substrate with the following
enzyme concentrations: 0.5 μM (wild-type), 0.5 μM (P91L),
1.5 μM (G117E), 3.0 μM (H180R), 1.0 μM (D233G),
or 3.0 μM (G304R) in a final volume of 50 μL. After 30
min, reactions were quenched by the addition of the same volume of
a developing solution containing 200 μM M344 (a known inhibitor
of HDAC8) and the commercial Developer II (BML-KI176-1250, Enzo Life
Sciences) in assay buffer. After 45 min, reaction solution samples
(100 μL) were transferred to a 96-well plate, and the fluorescence
of the aminomethylcoumarin product was measured using a Fluoroskan
plate reader (excitation = 355 nm, emission = 460 nm). All assays
were run in triplicate. Results are reported in Table 1.

Activity assays
with the HDAC8 activator35N-(phenylcarbamothioyl)benzamide were performed
under similar conditions. Briefly, the assay buffer contained 150
μM tetrapeptide substrate, 0, 1, 10, or 100 μM TM-251,
3% DMSO, and the following enzyme concentrations: 0.15 μM (wild-type),
0.25 μM (P91L), 1.5 μM (G117E), 3.0 μM (H180R),
0.40 μM (D233G), or 3.0 μM (G304R). Enzyme was first incubated
with the activator for 10 min before starting the reaction with the
substrate. Reaction time, developer, developing time, and fluorescence
reading were the same as described above. All assays were run in triplicate.

Thermostability Assays
The thermostabilities of HDAC8
mutants were determined using a thermal shift assay.37 Assay mixtures contained 5 μM HDAC8 mutant, 0 or
50 μM M344, 25 mM HEPES (pH = 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 500 μM
TCEP, and SYPRO orange dye (S6650, Life Technologies) at a 5×
final concentration. HDAC8 enzymes were incubated with or without
M344 for 45 min at 4 °C before the addition of SYPRO orange dye.
Since the M344 stock solution was prepared in DMSO, the corresponding
amount of DMSO was added to each enzyme for assays in the absence
of inhibitor. 20-μL samples of each mixture were transferred
to a 96-well plate (MicroAmp fast 96-well reaction plate, Applied
Biosystems). The plate was sealed (MicroAmp adhesive film, Applied
Biosystems) and incubated in a real-time polymerase chain reaction
instrument (StepOnePlus, Applied Biosystems) for 1 min at 20 °C
followed by a 1 °C increase per minute up to 90 °C. During
the thermal scan, fluorescence was monitored using a predefined filter
(ROX). Protein unfolding induces an increase in SYPRO orange fluorescence,
which was used to monitor thermal denaturation. Melting temperatures
(Tm) were designated as the inflection
point by fitting the initial portion of the curve (up to its maximum)
with a Boltzmann equation.37 All assays
were run in triplicate. Melting temperatures are reported in Table 1.

Crystallization
and Data Collection
Crystals of G117E
HDAC8 complexed with TSA were prepared by cocrystallization at 21
°C in sitting drops using the vapor diffusion method. A 500 nL
drop containing G117E HDAC8, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM KCl, 5% glycerol,
1 mM DTT, 2 mM TSA, and 0.03 M glycylglycylglycine was added to a
500 nL drop of precipitant solution and equilibrated against a 100-μL
reservoir of precipitant solution. The precipitant solution consisted
of 100 mM BisTris (pH 6.5), 10% (w/v) PEG 35000 (Fluka), and 4 mM
TCEP. Crystals of double mutants complexed with the tetrapeptide assay
substrate Ac-Arg-His-Lys(Ac)-Lys(Ac)-aminomethylcoumarin (Enzo Life
Sciences) were cocrystallized in similar fashion. Briefly, a 500 nL
drop containing 4.5 mg/mL HDAC8 double mutant, 2.5 mM substrate, 0.03
M glycylglycylglycine, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 76.4 mM KCl, 68.5 mM NaCl,
2.5% glycerol, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM DTT was added to
a 500 nL drop of precipitant solution and equilibrated against a 100
μL reservoir of precipitant solution. P91L-Y306F HDAC8 was cocrystallized
with substrate at 21 °C using a precipitant solution of 100 mM
Tris (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) PEG 35000 (Fluka), and 4 mM TCEP. D233G-Y306F
HDAC8 was cocrystallized with substrate at 21 °C using a precipitant
solution of 100 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) PEG 3350 (Hampton Research),
and 4 mM TCEP.

Typically, crystals appeared within 1–2
days for each mutant. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen
after transfer to a cryoprotectant solution consisting of precipitant
solution supplemented with 25–30% glycerol. X-ray diffraction
data were collected on beamline X29 at the National Synchrotron Light
Source (NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory, New York). Data collection
statistics are presented in Table 2. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000.38

Phasing, Model Building,
and Structure Refinement
Structures
were solved by molecular replacement using PHENIX39 with the atomic coordinates of the H143A HDAC8–tetrapeptide
substrate complex (PDB accession code 3EWF)31 less substrate,
ion, and solvent used as a search probe for rotation and translation
function calculations. Each model was refined through iterative cycles
of refinement with PHENIX and manual model rebuilding using COOT.40 Solvent molecules and inhibitors were added
after several rounds of refinement for each structure. For the D233G–Y306F
HDAC8–substrate complex, Translation libration screw (TLS)
refinement was performed in the late stages of refinement. TLS groups
were automatically determined using PHENIX.

Certain segments
in each structure (the N-terminus, the C-terminus, and a portion of
the L2 loop; side chains of some surface residues) appeared to be
disordered and were accordingly excluded from each final model as
summarized in the Supporting Information. Also, occasional ambiguous electron density peaks were observed
either on the protein surface (e.g., near F336 for the G117E HDAC8–TSA
complex; near M54, F189, F225, and V376 for the D233G–Y306F
HDAC8–substrate complex; or near F208 and K289 for the P91L–Y306F
HDAC8–substrate complex) or in the protein interior (e.g.,
near W141 for G117E HDAC8–TSA complex). Ambiguous electron
density near W141 likely corresponds to alternative conformations.
However, since such conformations were not confidently interpretable,
the W141 side chain was modeled in only one primary conformation.
Other ambiguous electron density peaks on the protein surface were
usually elongated and attributed to disordered PEG fragments or other
molecules present in the buffer solution used for crystallization.
However, since these electron density peaks were not confidently interpretable,
they were left unmodeled.

Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy
The secondary structures
of wild-type, H180R, and G304R HDAC8 enzymes were evaluated using
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy on an Aviv model 425 spectrometer
in a quartz cell with a 0.1 cm path length. Prior to each measurement,
enzyme was extensively buffer exchanged with 25 mM Tris (pH = 8.0)
and 5% (v/v) glycerol. Spectra were recorded at 4 °C in the far
UV region between 190–260 nm with a 5 μM enzyme concentration.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
GROMACS (GROningen MAchine
for Chemical Simulation) is a program for calculating MD simulations
written in ANSI C that is compatible with the GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER,
and CHARMM force fields.41−43 GROMACS is free and open source
online. The goal of the GROMACS developers is to enable MD calculations
on desktop-grade computing hardware instead of supercomputers to which
such calculations had previously been restricted. GROMACS comprises
an efficient and high-throughput molecular simulation suite of programs
that allow for hardware scaling, both in multiple computer clusters
and in single computers using multiple cores and graphics accelerators,
using both Message-Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing
(OpenMP) parallelization. A computer was built to exploit these features
as described in the Supporting Information.

The starting point for each MD simulation was the crystal
structure of wild-type HDAC8 as determined an enzyme–inhibitor
complex (PDB accession code 3RQD).44 After stripping the
coordinate file of all water and inhibitor atoms, amino acid substitutions
were made to the protein model in silico to generate
atomic coordinate sets for HDAC8 mutants H180R and G304R. The pdb2gmx command was then
run to generate a Gromacs-compatible topology, position restraint,
and structure file using the AMBER99SB-ILDN force field.45 A cubic or dodecahedral box was then defined
with faces ranging 10–17 Å away from the protein surface.
The box was filled with water molecules, and ions were added so that
the net charge of the system was 0. The protein–solvent system
was subject to energy minimization to ensure stability and the integrity
of subsequent MD runs. Thermal equilibration was run in two phases
to bring the system to the correct temperature, pressure, and density,
first using the constant number of particles, volume, and temperature
(NVT), and then the constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature
(NPT) equilibration schemes. Equilibration steps were judged to be
successful if the system quickly converged to the selected temperature
and if the pressure and density of the system remained stable for
a 100 ps run. All MD simulations were run for 10 ns with a step size
of 2 fs; frames were generated every 2 ps to sample each trajectory.

Results
H180R HDAC8
The imidazole side chain of H180 is one
of three protein ligands to the catalytically obligatory Zn2+ ion in the active site of HDAC8, so the substitution of H180 by
a bulky, positively charged arginine residue disrupts the metal binding
site. As a consequence, H180R HDAC8 is completely inactive (Table 1). Among all the CdLS
HDAC8 mutations identified to date,10−12 H180R HDAC8 is the only
one that involves the substitution of a residue that plays a direct
role in catalysis. Since our attempts to crystallize this critical
mutant in the presence and absence of ligands were unsuccessful, we
investigated the structural consequences of the H180R substitution
through MD simulations. Since the CD spectrum of H180R HDAC8 is essentially
identical to that of wild-type HDAC8 (Figure S1, Supporting Information), the overall fold of the mutant enzyme
is probably not significantly perturbed relative to that of the wild-type
enzyme. Therefore, wild-type HDAC8 serves as a suitable basis for
modeling and MD simulations of the H180R mutant.

MD trajectories were calculated for H180R HDAC8: one in which Zn2+ remained in the active site, coordinated by protein ligands
D178 and D267, and the other in which Zn2+ was absent from
the active site. We reasoned that while the H180R substitution would
destabilize Zn2+ binding, it might not completely abrogate
Zn2+ binding since the R180 side chain would not necessarily
block metal coordination by the remaining protein ligands. The 10
ns MD trajectory calculated for Zn2+-bound H180R HDAC8
reveals that the arginine side chain can fluctuate into the acetyllysine
binding groove of the active site, so the bulky R180 side chain may
sterically block substrates or inhibitors from binding even if a Zn2+ ion is weakly bound in the active site. While the conformation
of R180 occasionally fluctuates so as to minimize this blockage, the
guanidinium group generally remains in the region of the acetyllysine
Cα atom throughout the simulation (Figure 3a). Additionally, the steric bulk of the
R180 side chain triggers fluctuations of Y306 away from the “in”
conformation required for catalysis, such that the Y306 OH---Zn2+ separation increases by ca. 2 Å in comparison with
the wild-type enzyme (Figure 3b). Such fluctuations would also weaken inhibitor binding,
since Y306 typically hydrogen bonds with the Zn2+-bound
hydroxamate group of inhibitors.29−31

snapshots from the 10 ns MD simulation of
Zn2+-bound H180R HDAC8, with a tetrapeptide assay substrate
(blue) superimposed for reference (from the structure of the H143A
HDAC8–substrate complex, PDB accession code 3EWF). Zn2+ is a magenta sphere, R180 is red, and Y306 is yellow. (b) Y306 fluctuates
∼2 Å away from the “in” conformation required
for catalysis in H180R HDAC8 relative to its fluctuations in the wild-type
enzyme over the course of the 10 ns MD simulation. The fluctuations
of Y306 in the MD simulation of Zn2+-free H180R HDAC8 are
just slightly less (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

The 10 ns MD trajectory calculated
for Zn2+-free H180R
HDAC8 reveals that the arginine side chain protrudes into the acetyllysine
binding groove of the active site in a similar fashion as observed
for the Zn2+-bound mutant. Fluctuations observed for Y306
in Zn2+-free H180R HDAC8 are slightly less than those observed
in the Zn2+-bound mutant (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Even so, it appears that the conformation
of Y306 is sensitive to structural changes in the HDAC8 active site,
regardless of Zn2+ occupancy.

The H180R substitution
causes a significant decrease in thermostability,
with ΔTm = −5.8 °C;
equilibration with the inhibitor M344 does not enhance thermostability,
in contrast with wild-type HDAC8 (Table 1). This is consistent with MD simulations
indicating that substrate or inhibitor binding could be blocked by
the bulky R180 side chain. Since the hydroxamate group of M344 ordinarily
coordinates to the active site Zn2+ ion and hydrogen bonds
with Y306,31 the weakening of Zn2+ binding, the addition of steric bulk in the acetyllysine binding
groove, and the movement of Y306 away from the “in”
conformation observed in MD simulations completely disable inhibitor
binding. These features are similarly responsible for the complete
loss of catalytic activity exhibited by this mutant.

G304R HDAC8
G304 is located in a glycine-rich loop
that connects β-strand 8 to helix H1, ∼4 Å away
from the active site Zn2+ ion, and G304R HDAC8 is completely
inactive (Table 1).
Of the residues in the glycine-rich loop G302–G303–G304–G305,
G304 and G305 are strictly conserved among class I HDACs and HDAC-related
enzymes such as polyamine deacetylase.46,47 Importantly,
the glycine-rich loop is immediately adjacent to Y306, which must
adopt the “in” conformation for catalysis to enable
hydrogen bonding with the scissile carbonyl of substrate acetyllysine.31 Possibly, this glycine-rich loop confers flexibility
to facilitate conformational transitions between “in”
and “out” conformations for residue 306, as observed
in crystal structures of polyamine deacetylase,46,47 and MD simulations of HDAC348 and HDAC8
(N. H. Christianson, unpublished results).

Since our attempts
to crystallize G304R HDAC8 in the presence and absence of ligands
were unsuccessful, we investigated the structural consequences of
this amino acid substitution through MD simulations. The CD spectrum
of G304R HDAC8 is essentially identical to that of wild-type HDAC8
(Figure S1, Supporting Information), so
the overall fold of the mutant enzyme is essentially identical to
that of the wild-type enzyme. Thus, the wild-type enzyme structure
serves as a valid starting point for modeling and MD simulations of
the G304R mutant.

The 10 ns MD trajectory calculated for G304R
HDAC8 reveals that
the R304 side chain significantly protrudes into the acetyllysine
binding groove of the active site, so the bulky side chain will sterically
block substrates or inhibitors from binding. The R304 side chain generally
remains in this position during the entire course of the 10 ns simulation
(Figure 4a). Additionally,
the G304R substitution triggers significant fluctuations of Y306 away
from the “in” conformation required for catalysis, such
that the Y306 OH---Zn2+ separation increases by ca. 2 Å
in comparison with the wild-type enzyme (Figure 4b). Thus, even if R304 and the associated
glycine-rich loop were to move so as to allow acetyllysine binding,
this movement would also take Y306 out of the position normally required
for catalysis. These results suggest that mutations in the glycine-rich
loop could influence catalysis by compromising conformational fluctuations
required to position Y306 for catalysis.

Figure 4 (a) Superimposed 1 ns
snapshots from the 10 ns MD simulation of
Zn2+-bound G304R HDAC8, with a tetrapeptide assay substrate
(blue) superimposed for reference (from the structure of the H143A
HDAC8–substrate complex, PDB accession code 3EWF). Zn2+ is a magenta sphere, R304 is red, and Y306 is yellow. (b) Y306 fluctuates
∼2 Å away from the “in” conformation required
for catalysis in G304R HDAC8 relative to its fluctuations in the wild-type
enzyme over the course of the 10 ns MD simulation.

The G304R substitution causes a significant decrease
in thermostability,
with ΔTm = −6.8 °C;
equilibration with the inhibitor M344 does not enhance thermostability,
in contrast with wild-type HDAC8, indicating that inhibitor binding
is completely destabilized (Table 1). Since inhibitors generally hydrogen bond with Y306,29−31 the conformational transition of Y306 away from the “in”
conformation required for catalysis or inhibitor binding, as predicted
from MD simulations, could sufficiently destabilize binding so as
to be unobserved in thermal shift assays. Thus, it appears that both
the blockage of the acetyllysine binding site, as well as the movement
of Y306 away from the “in” conformation triggered by
the nearby G304R substitution, completely disable inhibitor binding,
substrate binding, and catalysis.

G117E HDAC8
G117
is located in helix B4, ∼20
Å away from the active site Zn2+ ion, close to the
protein surface and adjacent to the loop connecting β-strand
2 to helix B1. G117E HDAC8 exhibits 5% residual activity relative
to the wild-type enzyme (Table 1). The crystal structure of G117E HDAC8 was determined in
complex with the hydroxamate inhibitor TSA at 2.9 Å resolution.
Although the resolution is somewhat modest, it is clear that the overall
structure of G117E HDAC8 is generally similar to that of wild-type
HDAC8 in complex with TSA (root-mean-square (rms) deviation = 0.74
Å for 356 Cα atoms and 0.66 Å for 362 Cα atoms
for monomers A and B, respectively). No major structural changes are
observed for active site residues important for the chemistry of catalysis.

Electron density for the E117 side chain in helix B4 is oriented
toward solvent and is better defined in monomer A than in monomer
B (Figure 5a). The
substitution of the bulky glutamate side chain for that of the glycine
hydrogen atom does not significantly perturb the backbone conformation
of residue 117. In monomer A, the E117 carboxylate interacts with
the side chain of E66. Presumably, one of these two carboxylate side
chains is protonated to accommodate a hydrogen bond interaction (Figure 5a). Additionally,
helix B4 shifts ca. 0.5–1.0 Å, and the steric bulk introduced
by E117 triggers conformational changes in the nearby loop connecting
β-strand 2 to helix B1, with loop Cα atom shifts of up
to 2.5–2.6 Å (Figure 5b).

showing
the E117 side chain in the G117E HDAC8–TSA complex (monomer
A). Atomic color code are as follows: C = yellow, N = dark blue, O
= red, S = green. The side chain of E117 interacts with the side chain
of E66; one of these residues is presumably protonated to accommodate
this hydrogen bond. (b) Conformational changes induced by the G117E
mutation in the nearby loop connecting β-strand 2 to helix B1
in monomers A (yellow) and B (red) of G117E HDAC8 in comparison with
the wild-type HDAC8-TSA complex (blue) (PDB accession code 2V5W, monomer A). The
side chain of E117 in monomer B is characterized by weak electron
density and side chain atoms are not included in the final model after
the Cβ atom. However, these unmodeled atoms are included in
the figure as transparent sticks. (c) Comparison of the G117E HDAC8–TSA
complex (monomer A, yellow; inhibitor, brown carbon atoms) with the
wild-type HDAC8–TSA complex (monomer A, blue; inhibitor, white
carbon atoms). Two TSA molecules bind to the wild-type enzyme, but
only one molecule of TSA binds to G117E HDAC8. Significant conformational
differences are observed in the L1 and L2 loops between the two structures.

These conformational changes appear
to be transmitted through the
protein scaffolding to the L1 loop, which slightly constricts the
active site cleft and prevents the binding of a second TSA molecule
in a pocket adjacent to the active site (as observed for the wild-type
HDAC8–TSA complex29). This structural
change additionally appears to influence the L2 loop (Figure 5c). The binding of only one
molecule of TSA with consequent structural changes is also observed
in another CdLS mutant, T311M HDAC8.34

Finally, the G117E substitution causes a modest decrease in thermostability,
with ΔTm = −3.9 °C;
equilibration with the inhibitor M344 restores thermostability with
ΔTm = 3.0 °C, indicating that
inhibitor binding is favorable (Table 1). However, this ΔTm value is just about half that measured for M344 binding to wild-type
HDAC8 (ΔTm = 5.6 °C), so inhibitor
binding appears to be compromised in this mutant.

D233G HDAC8
The side chain of D233 is located on the
protein surface in the L6 loop connecting β-strand 6 to helix
F, ∼15 Å away from the active site Zn2+ ion,
and D233G HDAC8 exhibits 49% residual activity compared with the wild-type
enzyme (Table 1). In
wild-type HDAC8, D233 makes a hydrogen bonded salt link with K202
at the end of β-strand 5. The side chain of K202 additionally
donates a hydrogen bond to S276 in the L7 loop, so the D233–K202–S276
hydrogen bond network appears to be important for the stabilization
of loop conformations in the overall tertiary structure of HDAC8.

Cocrystallization of D233G HDAC8 with typical hydroxamate inhibitors
such as M344 or TSA yielded only poorly diffracting plate-like crystals
unsuitable for diffraction data collection. To circumvent this problem,
the Y306F mutation was introduced to inactivate the enzyme and enable
cocrystallization with a peptide substrate.33 This strategy recently proved successful in the study of three other
CdLS HDAC8 mutants,34 and here it proved
similarly successful for cocrystallization of D233G-Y306F HDAC8 with
the tetrapeptide assay substrate Ac-Arg-His-Lys(Ac)-Lys(Ac)-aminomethylcoumarin.
The crystal structure of this enzyme–substrate complex was
determined at 1.42 Å resolution and is similar to that of the
Y306F HDAC8–substrate complex33 (PDB
accession code 2V5W; rms deviation = 0.33 Å for 363 Cα atoms for both monomers
A and B). An omit electron density map shows that the tetrapeptide
substrate is essentially fully ordered in the active site of D233G–Y306F
HDAC8 (Figure 6a) and
adopts a conformation nearly identical to that observed in the complex
with Y306 HDAC8.33 No major structural
changes are observed for active site residues important for the chemistry
of catalysis.

and hydrogen bond interactions are shown as solid black and dashed
lines, respectively. The simulated annealing omit map (contoured at

at 3.0σ), each of which adopt two conformations. An ordered
water molecule fills the void created by the D233G mutation and hydrogen
bonds with K202 and a second water molecule. (c) Structure of the
Y306F HDAC8–substrate complex (monomer A, color coded as in
(a), PDB accession code 2V5W). Comparison with (b) illustrates structural changes
resulting from the D233G mutation.

Although the D233G mutation triggers only minor changes in
the
protein structure, these changes significantly compromise thermostability
with ΔTm = −6.8 °C (Table 1). The crystal structure
of D233G–Y306F reveals that two water molecules occupy the
void created by the deletion of the bulky D233 side chain (Figure 6b). Additionally,
the D233–K202–S276 hydrogen bond network is disrupted,
and the remaining K202–S276 hydrogen bond is weakened based
on the appearance of alternative, partially occupied conformers of
these side chains that exceed normal hydrogen bonding separations.
Thus, the most significant consequence of the D233G substitution appears
to be compromised thermostability due to perturbation of a hydrogen
bond network that stabilizes key tertiary structural interactions
involving the L6 loop, β-strand 5, and the L7 loop. MD simulations
of wild-type HDAC8 and D233G–Y306F HDAC8 indicate that the
rms fluctuation of K202 nearly doubles from 0.576 to 1.003 Å
in the absence of the D233 hydrogen bond; additional fluctuations
are also triggered in residues adjacent to K202, up to and including
F208 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Increased atomic fluctuations triggered by the D233G mutation
may be consistent with the significantly decreased thermostability
measured for this mutant.

P91L HDAC8
P91 is located in the
L2 loop, which flanks
one side of the active site and exhibits significant flexibility in
the binding of inhibitors and substrates.29−31,34,44,49 Accordingly, P91 is approximately 27–29 Å away from
the active site Zn2+ ion, depending on the conformation
of the L2 loop. With a residual catalytic activity of 86% compared
with the wild-type enzyme (Table 1), P91L HDAC8 is the least functionally compromised
of the mutants described herein.

As for D233G HDAC8, cocrystallization
attempts with P91L HDAC8 and hydroxamate inhibitors yielded only poorly
diffracting plate-like crystals. Accordingly, we prepared and cocrystallized
the inactive double mutant P91L–Y306F HDAC8 with the tetrapeptide
assay substrate Ac-Arg-His-Lys(Ac)-Lys(Ac)-aminomethylcoumarin. The
crystal structure of the D233G-Y306F HDAC8–substrate complex
was determined at 2.01 Å resolution and is quite similar overall
to that of the Y306F HDAC8–substrate complex33 (PDB accession code 2V5W; rms deviation = 0.30 Å for 363
Cα atoms and 0.36 Å for 356 Cα atoms for monomers
A and B, respectively). No major structural changes are observed for
active site residues important for the chemistry of catalysis. However,
the P91L mutation causes local structural changes that appear to increase
the flexibility of the L2 loop; even so, these changes only slightly
compromise enzyme thermostability (ΔTm = −0.8 °C; Table 1).

In HDAC8 crystal structures, higher thermal B factors
are usually
observed for residues contained in the L2 loop. Additionally, short
segments in the L2 loop are usually characterized by broken electron
density and presumed disordered in structures of HDAC8–inhibitor
complexes, but these segments are usually not disordered in inactive
HDAC8 mutant–substrate complexes.31,33,34 The only enzyme–substrate complex
in which a disordered L2 loop segment is observed is I243N–Y306F
HDAC8 complexed with the tetrapeptide assay substrate (PDB accession
code 4QA3):34 in monomer B only, D88 and D89 are disordered
and accordingly not modeled. The electron density map of the P91L–Y306F
HDAC8–substrate complex reveals that the D87–P91 segment
in monomer B flanking L91 is characterized by poor electron density
and is presumed disordered. In monomer A, although the main chain
atoms of this segment are characterized by nearly fully connected
electron density, these atoms are characterized by high thermal B
factors, and the side chains of Q84, E85, D88, D89, L91, D92, I94,
and E95 are characterized by broken or missing electron density (Figure 7). Thus, the P91L
mutation appears to increase the flexibility of the L2 loop. However,
this does not hinder substrate binding in the active site as indicated
by clear electron density for the tetrapeptide substrate (although
the N-terminal arginine residue of the substrate is partially disordered
(Figure S4)), nor does it hinder inhibitor
binding in view of the ΔTm of 5.9
°C for M344 binding, which is comparable to that of 5.6 °C
measured for the wild-type enzyme.

Figure 7 (a) Simulated annealing omit map of the
L2 loop segment flanking
residue 91 in the P91L–Y306F HDAC8–substrate complex
(monomer A, contoured at 2.7σ) indicates that the side chains
of residues Q84, E85, D88, D89, L91, D92, I94, and E95 are partially
or completely disordered (these side chains are represented as transparent
sticks). For comparison, the structure of the Y306F HDAC8–substrate
complex (monomer A, PDB accession code 2V5W) is shown in (b). Color codes are as
follows: C = yellow (P91L–Y306F HDAC8) or blue (Y306F HDAC8),
N = dark blue, O = red.

Catalytic Rescue by a Small Molecule Activator
Recently,
Singh and colleagues35 reported that N-acylthiourea derivatives can serve as selective activators
of HDAC8, and we demonstrated that one of these activators, N-(phenylcarbamothioyl)benzamide (designated “TM251”),
was capable of partially or completely rescuing the catalytic activity
of certain CdLS HDAC8 mutants in vitro.34 Here, we assessed the ability of TM251 to rescue
catalytic activity in the current set of five CdLS mutants (Table 3).

As for wild-type HDAC8,
the catalytic activities of G117E, D233G,
and P91L HDAC8 mutants are enhanced in dose-dependent fashion by TM251.
Specifically, we observe a 2–3-fold activation for these mutants,
and the catalytic activity of P91L HDAC8 and D233G HDAC8 could be
restored to a level comparable to that of the wild-type enzyme. However,
the catalytic activity of the completely inactive H180R and G304R
mutants could not be rescued by TM251. As previously observed in the
evaluation of other CdLS HDAC8 mutants,34 mutants that are completely inactive cannot be rescued by TM251;
mutants that exhibit residual activity can be rescued partially or
completely by TM251.

Discussion
To date, nearly all of
the mutations identified in HDAC8 in subjects
with CdLS-like disorders (Figure 1) map onto regions of the protein structure that ordinarily
might not be selected for mutagenesis to probe enzyme structure–function
relationships. Protein residues corresponding to missense mutations
are distributed randomly throughout the protein structure, both near
and far from the active site. Surprisingly, some of these distant
mutations significantly affect catalysis. Thus, the study of disease-linked
mutations provides intriguing new clues regarding long-range effects
on the chemistry of catalysis in the enzyme active site.

Some
of the amino acid substitutions presented herein exert their
influence over distances ranging 15–25 Å or greater, e.g.,
as observed for G117E HDAC8, D233G HDAC8, or P91L HDAC8. A common
theme that emerges from the study of these mutants, which exhibit
a wide range of residual activities (5–86%), taken together
with our previously reported structure–function relationships
for HDAC8 mutants C153F, A188T, I243N, T311M, and H334R,34 is that HDAC8 activity is highly sensitive to
the conformation of the L1 and L2 loops flanking the active site,
or structural elements that abut these loops. The L1 loop and especially
the L2 loop adopt variable conformations in the binding of inhibitors
and substrates,29−31,34,44,49 and can fluctuate significantly
in MD calculations.50 Thus, the conformational
flexibility of these loops required for optimal catalytic function
can be compromised by amino acid substitutions within the loops themselves,
as observed for P91L HDAC8, or by amino acid substitutions elsewhere
that trigger structural changes propagating through the protein scaffolding
to these loop(s), e.g., as observed for G117E HDAC8.

Other CdLS-related
HDAC8 mutations exert a more direct effect on
catalysis, such as the H180R mutation that removes a protein ligand
to the catalytically obligatory Zn2+ ion. While MD simulations
indicate that metal binding is not sterically precluded in this mutant,
these simulations indicate that R180 can protrude into the substrate
binding site and hinder the binding of acetyllysine. While the conformation
of R180 fluctuates in MD simulations, it does not adopt a conformation
that would allow ready access for substrate or inhibitor binding.
The blockage of the substrate binding groove, along with compromised
Zn2+ binding, are consistent with the lack of inhibitor
binding observed suggested by the insignificant ΔTm in the presence and absence of inhibitor M344 (Table 1).

The deleterious
effects on catalysis resulting from the G304R mutation
similarly result from partial blockage of the acetyllysine binding
site, even though the R304 side chain is capable of fluctuations that
could minimize steric interactions with the substrate. The MD simulations
provide additional insight on compromised catalysis in both G304R
HDAC8 and H180R HDAC8 that is perhaps more subtle, in that both amino
acid substitutions cause the conformation of Y306 to fluctuate away
from its required position for catalysis (Figures 3 and 4). Since Y306F
HDAC8 is nearly devoid of catalytic activity,33 mutations that cause Y306 to move away from the “in”
conformation similarly will be catalytically incompetent. Interestingly,
that G304R HDAC8 is completely devoid of catalysis suggests a potential
dynamical function for the flexible glycine-rich segment G302–G303–G304–G305
adjacent to Y306, which may facilitate the transition of Y306 between
“out” and “in” conformations in a possible
induced-fit substrate binding model.

While the direct correlation
of clinical severity with catalytic
activity or thermostability of CdLS HDAC8 mutations is challenging,
it is clear that the clinical phenotype is very sensitive to mutations
that even slightly compromise activity or thermostability. For example,
P91L HDAC8 exhibits 86% residual activity and just a slightly lower
melting temperature (ΔTm = −0.8
°C), yet the male diagnosed with this mutation exhibits significant
deformities in the upper limbs.11 In contrast,
however, one male and one female diagnosed with H334R HDAC8, which
exhibits 91% residual activity and a significantly lower melting temperature
(ΔTm = −7.0 °C),34 each present with a relatively moderate CdLS
phenotype.11 It is likely that disease
severity is related to total cellular HDAC8 activity.

However,
two main complicating factors in determining genotype–phenotype
correlations are the relatively few mutations identified to date,
and the X-linked nature of the HDAC8 clinical presentation. As an
inactivated X-linked gene, random differential expression of wild-type
and mutant alleles in various tissues and peripheral blood is seen
in female patients.11 Thus, expression
of the wild-type allele likely alleviates the severity of the defective
HDAC8 encoded by the mutant allele due to the location and extent
of inactivation of the mutant allele. As expected for an X-linked
disorder, the range of CdLS phenotypes outlined by Kaiser and colleagues11 shows that males are typically more affected.
In situations where a male presents with CdLS symptoms and a mutant
HDAC8 is diagnosed, e.g., as for P91L HDAC8, the clinical presentation
can tend to be more severe even though catalytic activity and thermostability
are less severely compromised.

Significantly, most CdLS HDAC8
mutants respond in vitro to the small molecule activator
TM251. Indeed, the catalytic activities
of 5 of the 10 missense mutants studied to date can be restored to
wild-type levels (Figure 8). Of these 10 missense mutants, only H180R HDAC8 and G304R
HDAC8—each diagnosed in a female patient—are catalytically
inactive and cannot be rescued by TM251 (while C153F HDAC8 exhibits
2% the activity of the wild-type enzyme, it can only be slightly reactivated
by TM25134). The structural basis for the
lack of reactivation in each of these mutants is the steric blockage
of substrate or product binding: in C153F HDAC8, the product acetate
release channel is blocked,34 and in H180R
HDAC8 and G304R HDAC8, the substrate binding groove is partially or
fully blocked (Figures 3 and 4). Additional factors include loss of
Zn2+ in H180R HDAC8 and the fluctuations of Y306 away from
the “in” conformation required for catalysis in H180R
HDAC8 and G304R HDAC8. These results suggest that unless a CdLS mutation
directly affects the conformation or chemical function of a catalytic
residue, the catalytic activity of a CdLS HDAC8 mutant may be partially
or fully rescued by a small molecule activator such as TM251.

Figure 8 Summary of
dose-dependent activation of mutant HDAC8 activity by
TM251. Data for the P91L, H180R, D233G, G117E, and G304 mutants are
recorded in Table 3; data for the C153F, A188T, I243N, T311M, and H334R mutants are
reported by Decroos and colleagues.34 The
activity level for wild-type HDAC8 in the absence of activator is
indicated by a dashed line. Catalytic activity for several mutants
can be restored to wild-type level or better by TM251, and all but
two mutants (H180R and G304R) exhibit at least some activation by
TM251.

Despite the intriguing results
acquired with TM251 as an activator
of CdLS HDAC8 mutants, we have as yet been unsuccessful in preparing
crystalline ternary complexes with activator, substrate, and CdLS
HDAC8 mutants. However, Srivastava and colleagues have utilized enzymological,
biophysical, and molecular modeling approaches to understand the molecular
basis of HDAC8 activation by TM251.51 Interestingly,
these investigators find that TM251 binds to HDAC8 at two sites in
a cooperative manner; additionally, TM251 modestly enhances inhibitor
binding affinity by approximately 2-fold. From analysis of the enzyme
structure and molecular modeling of enzyme–activator complexes,
these investigators conclude that TM251 binds near the active site,
potentially stabilizing active site loops that are important for the
binding of substrates and inhibitors.

In summary, the current
study demonstrates that TM251 or similar
small molecule activators35 may potentially
be useful in the clinical management of CdLS in patients diagnosed
with HDAC8 mutations, as long as these mutations do not directly affect
catalytic residues in the active site. Moreover, it is interesting
that the study of disease-linked mutations in HDAC8 elucidates new
structure–activity relationships that ordinarily might not
be explored in classical structure-based enzyme mutagenesis approaches.
Specifically, since CdLS mutations occur randomly throughout the protein
structure, and since these mutations affect catalysis as indicated
by the disease phenotype, the locations of these mutations both near
and far from the active site illuminate new long-range relationships
between the structure of the protein scaffolding and the chemistry
of catalysis in the active site. Future studies will continue to probe
these structural relationships, as well as the ability of small molecule
activators to rescue aberrant HDAC8 function.
