The Ca2+-triggered
fusion of docked synaptic and secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane
causes temporal release of neurotransmitter and hormone release, respectively.
Members of the SNARE family (soluble N-ethylmaleimide
sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) and accessory proteins
juxtapose vesicles and target membranes and, along with Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin and other factors, catalyze fusion. Synaptotagmins,
a family of ∼16 isoforms, consist of a short N-terminal lumenal
(or extracellular) domain, a single transmembrane α-helix, an
unstructured linker, and two C2 Ca2+-binding domains, termed
C2A and C2B. Depending on the isoform, they are localized to synaptic/secretory
vesicles or the plasma membrane. Synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) acts as a
primary Ca2+ sensor for fast synchronous synaptic vesicle
release and insulin secretion. Synaptotagmins constitute a highly
evolutionarily conserved protein family, especially for their Ca2+-binding domains. Although some biochemical studies of Syt1
have been conducted on brain extract or mammalian cell line immunoprecipitated
protein, the bulk of biochemical characterization, which requires
larger amounts of Syt1, has been conducted on the Escherichia
coli-expressed C2AB fragment of Syt1 consisting of only C2A
and C2B domains. Clearly, Syt1 expressed in E. coli lacks post-translational modifications, which have been reported
in the mammalian-derived Syt1 studies.

Syt1 is N-glycosylated() at Asn24() and O-glycosylated
at Thr15 and Thr16() in the luminal domain.
In the COS-7 mammalian
cell line, O-glycosylation has been reported to occur only in the
presence of synaptobrevin.() In PC12 cells,
both N- and O-glycosylations contribute to the proper targeting of
Syt1 to secretory vesicles and Syt1 endocytosis., In
addition to glycosylation, all five cysteines (Cys74, Cys75, Cys77,
Cys79, and Cys82) in the Syt1 transmembrane proximal region are stably
palmitoylated in PC12 and CV1 cells., Palmitoylation
appears to be required for complete N-glycosylation of Syt1.() Apart from Syt12, all Syt isoforms have at least
one transmembrane proximal cysteine residue.

Syt1 can be phosphorylated
at Thr125 and Thr128 by casein kinase
II, (Thr128 of Syt1 in Rattus norvegicus corresponds to Thr129 of Syt1 in Bos taurus identified
in ref ()) and at
Thr112 by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and
protein kinase C() as shown in vitro. In
vivo, K+-evoked depolarization or treatment with phorbol
ester in rat brain synaptosomes and PC12 cells induces an increase
in the level of phosphorylation at Thr112.()

Here we describe the expression, purification, and biochemical
properties of insect cell-expressed full-length mammalian Syt1. In
addition, we compare the biochemical properties of insect cell-expressed
full-length mammalian Syt1 to those of the still widely used, prokaryotically
expressed, Syt1-C2AB fragment. Using mass spectrometry, we have performed
the first comprehensive analysis of several post-translational modifications
of Syt1. Our results show that insect cell-expressed Syt1 carries
some of the previously described post-translational modifications
(glycosylation and phosphorylation) along with several new phosphorylation
and O-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we have identified a novel post-translational
modification of Syt1, tyrosine nitration. Furthermore, we have screened
for lipid binding partners of Syt1 and Syt3 using a new large set
of lipids. In addition to previously reported interactions with anionic
lipids, phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
[PtdIns(4,5)P2],− and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3],() Syt1 also interacts with additional phosphorylated
phosphatidylinositides and other anionic lipids. Furthermore, Syt1
interacts with different phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides in
a similar fashion, where the lysine rich region on the C2B domain
(with minor contributions from Arg398 and Arg399) mediates Ca2+-independent interactions and the C2A, C2B Ca2+-binding loops mediate Ca2+-dependent interactions.

Experimental Procedures
Protein Expression
Full-length rat synaptotagmin 1
(1–421) and full-length
Syt1 Gln154Cys, Cys74Ser, Cys75Ser, Cys77Ser, Cys79Ser, Cys82Ser,
Cys277Ser coding sequences were cloned into the pvl1393 vector (Pharmingen).
For affinity purification, a 3C protease cleavable His10 tag and a
1D4 tag were added at the C-terminus. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with pvl1393 carrying
the Syt1 gene and linearized AcNPV DNA (Sapphire Baculovirus DNA,
Orbigen) using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). Baculovirus was amplified
in Sf9 cells in 10% fetal bovine serum containing SF900-II (Gibco)
medium.

Large-scale protein expression was performed by infection
of Trichoplusia ni (Hi5) cells in Insect-Xpress medium
(Biowhitaker)
at a cell density of 2.0 × 106 cells/mL with an infection
course of 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed with
an M-110EH microfluidizer processor at 18000 psi (Microfluidics).

Protein Purification
Detergent Screen for Extraction of Syt1 from Insect Cell Membranes
The efficiency of different detergents in extracting Syt1 from
insect membranes was screened by adding 1 wt % (g)/v (mL) of a detergent
to 1 mL of membranes and solubilizing them for 4 h at 4 °C. Samples
were spun at 100000 rpm for 30 min. All detergents were from Anatrace.
Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
(4 to 15%) was performed on the supernatant, containing detergent-solubilized
Syt1, and Syt1 was detected by Western blotting with an anti-His antibody.
Syt1 was observed in samples solubilized with n-decyl
β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM), FOS-10, FOS-14, n-ocytl β-d-glucopyranoside (OG), and HEGA-10.
Syt1 was not observed in samples solubilized with CHAPS, CHAPSO, CYGLU-3,
and LDAO. For further purification, after membrane purification, Syt1
was extracted from membranes with either FOS-14 or DDM.

Purification
After membrane purification and detergent
extraction, Syt1 was subsequently “batch” purified with
Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) at 4 °C, followed by 1D4 antibody affinity
purification, in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 5% glycerol, 1% FOS-14 (or DDM), and protease inhibitors. In general,
although the purity after 1D4 affinity purification was higher, the
yield was lower, so we frequently skipped this step. From the NiNTA
resin, the protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole (pH 7.5), 500
mM NaCl, and 0.02% DDM, and from the 1D4 antibody column using the
1D4 peptide. Syt1 was further purified by ion exchange chromatography
[MonoS resin (GE Healthcare)] and/or size exclusion chromatography
[KW-803.5 (Shodex)] to remove the Syt1 fragment of residues 111–421
from the full-length protein. For ion exchange, Syt1 was loaded in
0.1 M NaCl, 25 mM MES (pH 6.0), 0.02% DDM, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol.
Size exclusion chromatography was conducted in 50 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% DDM with or without 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol.
For experiments other than lipid-overlay assay tags were removed using
PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) in size exclusion chromatography
buffer.

Dye Labeling
The mutant full-length Syt1 (1–421,
Cys74Ser, Cys75Ser, Cys77Ser, Cys79Ser, Cys82Ser, Cys277Ser, Gln154Cys)
fragment was purified in the same way as the wild-type protein, and
the purified sample was mixed with Cy5-maleimide (GE Healthcare) in
50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 0.02%
DDM and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Free dye was separated from
labeled protein using ion exchange (MonoS). The presence of Cy5 dye
on Gln154Cys was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The labeling efficiency,
estimated by ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) dye and protein
absorption at respective wavelengths, was ∼55–80%.

Syt1-C2AB and Syt3-C2AB Expression and Purification
R. norvegicus Syt1(96–421), Syt3(292–587),
Syt1(96–421) Arg398Glu/Arg399Glu (termed Syt1-C2AB RR), and
Syt1-C2AB(96–421) Lys326Glu/Lys327Ala (termed Syt1-C2AB KK)
fragments were tagged with biotin, expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins, and purified as previously described.() Syt1(96–421) Arg398Glu/Arg399Glu and
Syt1(96–421) Lys326Glu/Lys327Ala fragments with an N-terminal
Avitag were generated by gene synthesis (Geneart, AG) and subcloned
into the pGEX6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). The GST tag was cleaved
with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) for all experiments. The
absence of DNA contamination() of purified
C2AB fragments was confirmed by the lack of UV–vis absorption
at 260 nm.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Analysis
CD data were collected
on an Aviv202-01 spectrometer equipped with
a thermoelectric unit using a 1 mm path-length cell. Protein samples
were at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL in buffer containing 20 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mM KCl, and 0.02% dodecyl maltoside (DDM).
The protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280 nm.
Wavelength scans were measured from 190 to 270 nm every 1 nm with
an averaging time of 1 s.

Lipids
Egg phosphatidylcholine (eggPC), dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine
(DOPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine
(POPE), brain phosphatidylserine (PS), brain sphingomyelin (SM), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol) (PtdIns), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol-3′-phosphate)
(PtdIns3P), brain phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol-5′-phosphate)
(PtdIns5P), brain phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2],
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol-3′,5′-bisphosphate)
[PtdIns(3,5)P2], 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol-3′,4′,5′-trisphosphate)
[PtdIns(3,4,5)P3], 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Lissamine Rhodamine
PE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC), and 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (SOPS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids as chloroform
or chloroform/methanol/water solutions. Dihydrocholesterol was from
Sigma-Aldrich, and it was used instead of cholesterol to prevent cholesterol
oxidation.

Reconstitution of Full-Length Syt1 and Binding to Supported
Lipid Bilayers
Liposomes for Syt1 reconstitution were made
from either 100% POPC
or an 80:20 POPC/SOPS mixture. Liposomes used to make supported lipid
bilayers were made from an 80:20 POPC/SOPS mixture. Liposomes were
made by a dry-film method, in which we dried the chloroform solution
of lipids under argon while continuously manually rotating a round
glass tube to make a thin lipid film. The thin lipid film was further
dried overnight under vacuum. Lipid films were rehydrated in 50 mM
Hepes (pH 7.0) and 150 mM NaCl at room temperature with intermittent
vortexing. An aqueous content dye, 250 mM calcein, was added during
rehydration to lipids used for Syt1 reconstitution. Both calcein and
calcein-free liposomes were frozen and thawed in liquid nitrogen five
times and extruded through a 50 nm pore filter (Avanti Polar Lipids).
For reconstitution of full-length Syt1 into calcein-POPC/SOPS liposomes,
Cy5-labeled Gln154Cys, Cys74Ser, Cys75Ser, Cys77Ser, Cys79Ser, Cys82Ser,
Cys277Ser Syt1 was mixed with liposomes at protein:lipid ratio of
1:4000 and decyl maltoside (Anatrace, Inc.) to a lipid ratio of 1:2.
The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by 15
min at room temperature, and passed over a 12 cm × 0.5 cm CL4B
resin (GE Healthcare) column in detergent-free buffer. Fractions containing
proteoliposomes were collected on the basis of the calcein absorption
wavelength (495 nm). Protein-free POPC/SOPS supported lipid bilayers
were formed on quartz slides by incubation of quartz/glass sample
chambers with 7 mg/mL liposomes for 20–30 min at room temperature.
Sample chambers were constructed from quartz slides and borosilicate
glass coverslips that were cleaned as previously described.() The single-molecule/particle images were collected
with a prism-based total internal reflection (TIR) fluorescence microscope
as previously described.() An alternating
488 nm/635 nm laser illumination sequence was used to determine the
location of calcein-liposome and Cy5-Syt1 spots. Collected images
were corrected for background fluorescence and fluorescent spots localized
as previously described.() In Figure , calcein and Cy5 spots were colocalized and the
number of colocalized spots was counted; 75% of supported lipid bilayer-bound
calcein-liposomes contained Cy5-Syt1.

Lipid Overlay Assay
Membrane Lipid Strips, PIP Strips,
and SphingoStrips (Echelon Biosciences)
contained 100 pmol of a single lipid species spotted on a hydrophobic
membrane. Full-length Syt1(1–421), Syt1-C2AB(96–421),
and Syt3-C2AB(292–587) constructs were incubated with Membrane
Lipid Strips, PIP Strips, and SphingoStrips (Echelon Biosciences)
following the manufacturer’s instructions in an identical buffer
containg 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% dodecyl maltoside,
1% nonfat milk, and either 0.1 mM EGTA or 0.1 mM EGTA and 1.1 mM CaCl2. Binding of Syt to lipids was detected in the following manner.
Full-length Syt1 carrying a 1D4 tag was detected with an anti-1D4
antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase secondary antibody. Alkaline
phosphatase was detected with the BCIP/NBT substrate system (Thermo
Scientific). Syt1-C2AB(96–421) and Syt3-C2AB(292–587)
carrying a biotin tag were detected with streptavidin conjugated to
fluorophore AlexaFluor647 (Life Technologies). Streptavidin-AlexaFluor647
fluorescence was imaged using a fluorescence scanner (Typhoon, Amersham).
To quantify binding of full-length Syt1, Syt1-C2AB(96–421),
and Syt3-C2AB(292–587) constructs to lipids, the chromogenic
or fluorescence intensity of lipid spots on Membrane Lipid Strips,
PIP Strips, and SphingoStrips was integrated and background subtracted
using UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific) gel and blot analysis software.

Biosensor Assay
Site specifically biotinylated Syt1-C2AB
and Syt3-C2AB were immobilized
on a streptavidin tip, and binding of various liposomes to Syt was
assessed using biolayer interferometry. Syt3 immobilized in this configuration
was previously found to be functional as determined by its ability
to bind to the SNARE complex.() Because
of the high avidity of the interaction (many Syt1 on the tip with
many lipids on the vesicle), the binding is nearly irreversible, and
thus, equilibrium has not been reached in these measurements. However,
because all interactions are evaluated under identical conditions,
such measurements are informative, and similar caveats apply to commonly
used pull-down experiments. Liposomes used in the biosensor assay
were composed of various phospholipids, cholesterol, and a single
anionic lipid species used as a target lipid for assaying its interaction
with Syt. Compositions of liposomes in molar ratios are listed in
Table . The headgroup composition of phospholipids
mimicked the ratio reported for total brain extracts,, the exception being that anionic lipids (PS, PtdIns, and phosphorylated
phosphatidylinositols) were added at twice the concentration reported
for total brain extract and synaptic vesicles because 90–100%
of those lipids are located in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane
and the outer leaflet of synaptic vesicles. Liposomes were made by
a dry-film method in the following way. All chloroform solutions of
lipids were mixed at the molar ratios mentioned above and dried under
argon as a thin lipid film on the wall of a round glass tube while
the glass tube was continuously manually rotated. The thin lipid film
was further dried overnight under vacuum. Thin lipid film was then
rehydrated in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EGTA at
40 °C with occasional vortexing. The liposome solution was then
frozen and thawed five times in liquid nitrogen and extruded through
a 50 nm pore filter (Avestin, Inc.). Lissamine rhodamine absorption
was used to determine the concentration of extruded liposomes. The
size of the extruded liposomes was checked by dynamic light scattering;
all mixtures had radii of approximately 50 nm (data not shown).

An Octet system (ForteBio, Inc.) equipped with streptavidin
SA
biosensors (ForteBio, Inc.) was used to study the Syt1-C2AB–
and Syt3-C2AB–lipid interactions in the absence and presence
of Ca2+. N-Terminally biotinylated Syt1-C2AB, Syt1-C2AB
KK, Syt1-C2AB RR, and Syt3-C2AB constructs at 2.5 μg/mL in 20
mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCl, 100 μM EGTA, and 0.05% Tween
20 were agitated at 1000 rpm and bound to streptavidin SA biosensors
(ForteBio, Inc.) with typical capture levels of 2.0–2.9 nm
between different proteins. Syt-loaded biosensors were equilibrated
in Tween 20-free buffer. Syt-loaded biosensors were incubated with
5 μM liposomes in the case of Syt3C2AB and 20 μM liposomes
in the case of Syt1-C2AB, Syt1-C2AB RR, and Syt1-C2AB KK in 20 mM
Hepes (pH 7.2), 150 mM KCl, 100 μM EGTA or 100 μM EGTA,
and 1.1 mM Ca2+ at 25 °C. To ensure that binding of
liposomes is synaptotagmin specific, 5 μM liposomes were incubated
with streptavidin biosensors to which synaptotagmin was not attached,
and no binding was observed (Figure A). As
a control to show that binding of Syt to streptavidin biosensors is
specific and mediated by the N-terminal biotin tag, we incubated streptavidin
biosensors with 5 mM biotin for 2 h at room temperature prior to the
addition of 2.5 μg/mL N-terminally biotinylated Syt1-C2AB under
the conditions described above. When the streptavidin biosensors are
preblocked with biotin, we observe no binding of N-teminally biotinylated
Syt to biosenors (data not shown).

Detection of Nitrated Tyrosines in Synaptic Vesicle Proteins
Frozen brains from 3–4-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories International. Synaptic
vesicles were purified as previously described,() with an exception that the controlled-pore-glass chromatography
step was omitted and the peripheral protein removal step was followed.
The P3 fraction described by Hell et al.() was used for our experiments. The presence of synaptic vesicles
in the P3 fraction was confirmed by enrichment of α-synaptophysin,
and the presence of Syt1 and synaptobrevin as detected by Western
blotting with their respective antibodies (Synaptic Systems) (data
not shown). The diameter of particles in the P3 fraction was ∼43
± 9 nm as determined by dynamic light scattering (Malvern Instruments)
(data not shown), consistent with reported synaptic vesicle size.() For detection of nitrated tyrosines of synaptic
vesicle proteins, purified synaptic vesicles (P3 fraction) were mixed
with 10% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 100
mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EGTA, incubated at 40 °C for 30 min, boiled,
loaded onto a 4 to 15% SDS–PAGE gel, and blotted on PVDF membranes.
Proteins with nitrated tyrosines were detected with primary monoclonal
anti-nitrotyrosine rabbit IgG (Life Technologies) and horseradish
peroxidase-linked secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories)
antibodies and detected on the film using enhanced chemiluminescence
(GE Healthcare). For the detection of Syt1, anti-nitrotyrosine primary
and secondary antibodies were stripped using a Western blot stripping
buffer (Thermo Scientific) and blots were restained with primary monoclonal
anti-Syt1 (BD Transduction Laboratories) and horseradish peroxidase-linked
secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) antibodies and detected
on the film using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare). Nitrotyrosine
bovine serum albumin (Cayman Chemicals) was used as a positive control
for anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and antibody stripping, and as a negative
control for the anti-Syt1 antibody. The location of the SDS–PAGE
markers (Rainbow full range, GE Healthcare) on the film relative to
the developed bands was manually marked with a pen.

Mass Spectrometry
Sample Preparation
The SDS–PAGE gel band of
insect cell-expressed and -purified full-length Syt1 was Coomassie-stained
(Bio-Rad) and destained in 200 μL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate
in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile (ACN) for 15 min, and then 200 μL
of 100% ACN was applied for 15 min at room temperature. Dithiothreitol
(DTT) was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and incubated at
65 °C for 30 min to reduce the disulfide bonds. The reduced cysteines
were then alkylated with the addition of iodoacetamide (IAA) at a
final concentration of 20 mM and incubated at room temperature in
the dark for 30 min. The iodoacetamide was then removed, and washes
were performed with 200 μL of distilled water followed by addition
of 100 μL of ACN. Then ACN was removed, and 50 μL of the
0.01 μg/μL trypsin solution was added to the diced gel
band, allowed to rehydrate at 4 °C for 30 min, and then incubated
at 37 °C overnight. The tryptic mixtures were acidified with
formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 1%. Peptides were extracted
three times from the gel plugs using 50% ACN and 1% FA, concentrated
with a SpeedVac to a desired volume (∼18 μL), and subjected
to liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
Nanoflow reverse phase LC–MS/MS was performed using a capillary
HPLC system (Agilent 1200, Agilent Technologies) coupled with a linear
ion trap mass spectrometer LTQ-FT Ultra Hybrid ion cyclotron resonance
mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) through a nanoelectrospray ionization
source built in house. Eight microliters of the tryptic peptides was
preconcentrated and desalted onto a ZORBAX 300SB-C18 trap
column [5 μm (inside diameter) × 5 mm, Agilent Technologies]
with 5% ACN and 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 15 μL/min for 5 min.
The separation of the tryptic peptides was performed on a C18 reverse phase column [75 μm (inside diameter) × 360 μm
(outside diameter) × 100 mm (length)] packed in house with a
4 μm 100 Å pore size C18 reversed phase stationary
phase (Synergy, Phenomenex) kept at a constant 40 °C using a
column heater built in house at a flow rate of 380 nL/min. The mobile
phases consisted of 5% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (A) and
95% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). A 90 min linear gradient
from 18 to 35% B was used. Data were acquired using the Xcalibur (version
2.0.6) software supplied with the instrument. The LC runs were monitored
in positive ion mode by sequentially recording survey MS scans (m/z 400–2000), in the ICR cell,
while three MS2 were obtained in the ion trap via CID for the most
intense ions.

Database Searching and Protein Identification
MS/MS
spectra were extracted from raw data files and converted into mgf
files using PAVA (University of California, San Francisco, CA). Mascot
version 2.2 (Matrix Science Inc., London, U.K.) and X!Tandem() were used to perform database searches against
the human subset SwissProt database of the extracted MS/MS data. The
peptide tolerance was set at ±10 ppm with the MS/MS tolerance
set at ±0.6 Da. Trypsin specificity was used allowing for one
missed cleavage. The modifications of Met oxidation, protein N-terminal
acetylation, nitrotyrosine, and peptide N-terminal pyroglutamic acid
formation were allowed for, and Cys carbamidomethylation was set as
a fixed modification. Search results can be viewed in the gpmDB (http://rat.thegpm.org) using accession code GPM64500003242.

Results
Insect Cell-Expressed Full-Length Synaptotagmin 1
Full-length
Syt1 has been expressed in various mammalian cell lines
for cell-based assays, but not in quantities amenable for purification
and biochemical studies. To obtain the post-translational modifications
found in natively expressed Syt1, we expressed Syt1 in a eukaryotic
expression system using insect cells. After purification with affinity
chromatography (utilizing His and 1D4 tags), a SDS–PAGE gel
showed that insect cell-expressed Syt1 contains three bands: a full-length
construct with an apparent molecular mass of ∼65 kDa (the sequence-predicted
molecular mass is 47.4 kDa) that constituted the majority of the protein,
a minor degradation product of ∼40 kDa, and a small amount
of SDS-resistant dimer (running slightly above the 105 kDa molecular
mass marker) (Figure A). N-Terminal sequencing
of the 65 and ∼40 kDa SDS–PAGE bands showed that the
former band starts with residue Val2 while the latter band starts
with residue Lys111. Western blots against the C-terminal tag confirmed
that both species end at residue Lys421 (data not shown). Thus, the
degradation product corresponds to the C2AB fragment. The observation
of these three SDS–PAGE bands (the main product at ∼65
kDa, a small amount of SDS-resistant dimer, and the C2AB fragment)
is consistent with the SDS–PAGE profile of Syt1 purified from Rattus synaptic vesicles.() The
C2AB degradation fragment can be separated from the full-length species
using either ion exchange or size exclusion chromatography (Figure D).

Syt1-C2AB fragment in the presence and absence of Ca2+.

Full-Length Syt1 Is Folded
To determine whether insect
cell-expressed and -purified Syt1 is
folded, we measured its circular dichroism spectrum and compared it
to that of the prokaryotically expressed Syt1-C2AB fragment (Figure B,C). The spectrum of the C2AB fragment has a minimum
at 218 nm indicative of a mainly β-sheet rich fold (Figure C), as previously reported.() The circular dichroism spectrum of full-length Syt1 (Figure B) is indicative of a folded protein with an increased
α-helical contribution (with minima at 208 and 222 nm) compared
to that of the C2AB fragment. This increase in α-helical content
is expected as full-length Syt1 contains a transmembrane α-helix.
In addition, the luminal domain of Syt1, which is highly homologous
to that of Syt2, probably encompasses an additional α-helical
segment, as suggested by the crystal structure of the Syt2–botulinum
neurotoxin B complex.() While it is unknown
if the luminal segment remains α-helical in the absence of botulinum
neurotoxin B, it is nevertheless predicted to be α-helical by
secondary structure prediction algorithms.

The E. coli-expressed Syt1-C2AB fragment binds
anionic lipids, phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
[PtdIns(4,5)P2], by simultaneously coordinating Ca2+ to
Ca2+-binding loops of the C2A and C2B domains and to PS
and PtdIns(4,5)P2.,, Thus, to further confirm that insect cell-expressed Syt1 is functionally
folded, we tested its ability to bind PS-containing lipid membranes
in a Ca2+-dependent manner. We reconstituted full-length
Syt1 into liposomes (here termed Syt1-liposomes) with or without PS
and assayed the Ca2+ dependence of binding of Syt1-liposomes
to PS-containing supported lipid bilayers by single-molecule fluorescence
microscopy (Figure ). Liposomes were fluorescently labeled by entrapment of the water-soluble
dye, calcein, inside the liposomes, and the number of fluorescent
liposomes bound to the supported lipid bilayer was counted. To confirm
that binding of Syt1-liposomes to the supported lipid bilayers is
mediated by Syt1, we removed the cytoplasmic domain of Syt1 from the
Syt1-liposomes via digestion with the chymotrypsin protease (Figure A, right bar chart). As a further conformation that
binding of Syt1-liposomes to Syt1-free supported lipid bilayers is
mediated by Syt1, we labeled Syt1 with a fluorescent dye at a specific
site and counted the number of optically colocalized Syt1 and liposome
particles bound to supported lipid bilayers (Figure B). Thus, binding of liposomes with and without PS to PS-containing
supported lipid bilayers is dependent on the presence of both Syt1
and Ca2+.

Full-length
Syt1 binds PS bilayers in a Ca2+-dependent manner. (A)
Binding of full-length Syt1 reconstituted into 100% PC liposomes,
fluorescently labeled with the aqueous content dye, calcein, to 80:20
PC/PS supported lipid bilayers is dependent on Ca2+ and
Syt1. The left panel shows a cartoon of the experiment. The middle
panels show representative images of supported lipid bilayers in the
presence and absence of Syt1 where bright spots are calcein-labeled
liposomes. The blue lines on top of the images represent the wavelength
of the excitation laser (488 nm). The right panel shows the mean number
of calcein-bound liposomes bound to the bilayer after a 5 min incubation
and after unbound liposomes were washed off with buffer containing
the respective amount of Ca2+. Error bars indicate the
standard deviation. (B) Binding of fluorescently labeled full-length
Syt1 reconstituted into 80:20 PC/PS liposomes to supported lipid bilayers
is dependent on Ca2+. Fluorescently labeled Syt1 was reconstituted
in 80:20 PC/PS aqueous content labeled liposomes and incubated over
80:20 PC/PS bilayers for 20 min at different Ca2+ concentrations.
The left panel shows a cartoon of the experiment. The three middle
panels show representative images of supported lipid bilayers in the
absence of Ca2+ (left image) and presence of Ca2+ (middle and right images). The lines on top of the images represent
the wavelengths of the excitation laser (blue for 488 nm and red for
635 nm). The two images in the presence of Ca2+ show the
same field of view that is optically split into two channels to monitor
labeled liposomes and labeled Syt1. An example of a colocalized Syt1
and liposome spot is marked in red and blue, respectively. The right
panel shows the average number of Syt1-liposomes bound by counting
the number of spots colocalized to the supported lipid bilayer imaged
after unbound liposomes were washed off with buffer containing the
respective amount of Ca2+. Error bars indicate the standard
deviation. Note that the concentration of Syt1-liposomes was different
from that for the experiments shown in panel A. For both experiments,
the number of spots was counted in four different 80 μm ×
80 μm areas of the bilayer for two different bilayers.

Identification of Post-Translational Modifications of Insect
Cell-Expressed Mammalian Syt1
Syt1 expressed in mammalian
cell lines or immunoprecipitated from
synaptic vesicles has several post-translational modifications.−,,,,, We have analyzed post-translational modifications
of Hi5 insect cell-expressed Syt1 to evaluate how closely the pattern
of post-translational modifications match the ones reported for mammalian
cells. Although we obtained good coverage of peptides (70–86%
of the Syt1 sequence), we were unable to observe the transmembrane
domain (residues 52–94) that is predicted to have several palmitoylation
sites (Cys74, Cys75, Cys77, Cys79, and Cys82). Our mass spectrometry
analysis revealed both previously reported and new post-translational
modifications (Figure A).

Post-translational
modifications of Syt1. (A) Shown is the sequence of Syt1 from R. norvegicus along with Syt1 post-translational modifications.
The transmembrane domain is colored cyan (residues 58–79),
the C2A domain yellow (residues 143–264), and the C2B domain
gray (residues 274–377). Cysteine residues are colored orange
(Cys74, Cys75, Cys77, Cys79, Cys82, and Cys277). Cysteines predicted
to be palmitoylated are marked with wavy lines (Cys74, Cys75, Cys77,
Cys79, and Cys82). Residues reported in the literature as glycosylated
are colored brown (Thr15, Thr16, and Asn24). Residues reported in
the literature as phoshorylated (Thr112, Thr127, and Thr128) are colored
magenta. Post-translational modifications identified here by mass
spectrometry are marked by black squares: Thr26 (O-glycosylated, colored
brown), Ser30 and Thr128 (phoshorylated, colored magenta), and Tyr151,
Tyr216, Tyr229, Tyr311, Tyr364, and Tyr380 (nitrated, colored green).
(B) Local sequence alignments of R. norvegicus synaptotagmin
isoforms for residues carrying post-translational modifications identified
here by mass spectrometry: tyrosine nitration, phosphorylation, and
O-glycosylation, as indicated on top of the sequences. The post-translationally
modified residue numbers correspond to those of Syt1. (C) Detection
of proteins with nitrated tyrosines in synaptic vesicles. Shown is
a representative Western blot of rat synaptic vesicles (SV). A 4 to
15% SDS–PAGE gel was blotted first with primary anti-nitrotyrosine
antibody (left) and then with primary anti-synaptotagmin 1 antibody
(right). SDS–PAGE molecular mass markers (shown as ticks in
three lanes in each gel) have been marked on both films with a pen
on the basis of the locations of the SDS–PAGE molecular mass
markers on the Western blot membrane. Arrows point to the location
of Syt1. Nitrotyrosine BSA (nBSA) was used as a positive and negative
control. (D) SDS–PAGE gel (4 to 15%) stained with Commassie
dye of insect cell-expressed and -purified Syt1 treated with PNGaseF
or not treated, as indicated. Right and left lanes contained molecular
mass markers.

Tyrosine Nitration
We detected nitration in 6 of 11
surface accessible tyrosine residues,
three in the C2A domain (Tyr151, Tyr216, and Tyr229) and three in
the C2B domain (Tyr311, Tyr364, and Tyr380) (Figure B). Tyrosine nitration is a new post-translational modification
of Syt1 that has not been previously reported for any synaptotagmin
isoform. Integration of the peak intensity for the individual Syt1
peptides suggests a stoichiometry for the nitrotyrosine modifications
of 1–10% depending on the site, with the exception of Tyr151,
which appears to be ∼100% modified because an unmodified form
was not identified. The estimated 1–10% modification for the
other sites is a lower limit as the modification is likely to decrease
the ionization potential of the respective peptides. Despite the low
level of modification of individual sites within the protein population,
low-level modifications can have significant signaling and other bioactive
effects on a system.−

To test whether tyrosine nitration is present
in vivo, we purified Rattus synaptic vesicles, performed
SDS–PAGE, and
performed Western blotting with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. Although
synaptic vesicles contain many different proteins,() we observed five distinct nitrated tyrosine bands (Figure C) whose identities are unknown. However, the location
of one of these bands is consistent with Syt1 (Figure C), suggesting that tyrosine nitration reported here might
occur in vivo. Sequence alignment showed that Tyr151 is conserved
among all Rattus synaptotagmin isoforms, Tyr216 is
conserved in all but Syt3, Syt8, Syt12, and Syt13 isoforms, Tyr229
is conserved in Syt1–Syt3, Syt5, Syt9 and Syt10, Tyr311 is
conserved in all isoforms apart from Syt12 and Syt13, Tyr364 is conserved
in Syt1–Syt3, Syt5, Syt6, Syt9, and Syt10, and Tyr380 is present
in only Syt1 (Figure B). Interestingly, R. norvegicus Syt1 Tyr311 corresponds to the same residue
as the tyrosine characterized in Drosophila melanogaster’s Syt AD3 mutant (D. melanogaster Tyr364Asn).() Mutation of this Syt1 residue, Tyr311Asn, has
an effect on both Syt1-mediated Ca2+-triggered exocytosis() and Syt1 endocytosis.()

Syt1 Tyr364 is a part of the Ca2+-binding region
of
the C2B domain and is only partially conserved (Figure B). Although Tyr364 participates in Ca2+ coordination
via its backbone oxygen, it is possible that nitration of its side
chain will influence the conformation of the Ca2+-binding
loops. Sequence comparison of Syt isoforms (Figure B) shows that Syt4, Syt8, Syt11–Syt13, and Syt15 do
not have a tyrosine residue at this position. Interestingly, these
same isoforms have been either shown or predicted not to bind Ca2+ via their Ca2+-binding loops., Furthermore, the same isoforms bind anionic lipids and the syntaxin–SNAP-25
binary complex in a Ca2+-independent manner and inhibit
SNARE-mediated, Ca2+-triggered lipid mixing.()

Phosphorylation
We detected phosphorylation of the
previously reported Thr128 site() and of
a new Ser30 site (Figure A). Ser30 is the
first reported phosphorylation site in the
Syt1 luminal domain. However, we did not observe the previously characterized
phosphorylation sites, Thr125 (detected in vitro after reaction with
casein kinase II) and Thr112 (detected in vitro after reaction with
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and protein
kinase C).() Phosphorylation sites Thr112,
Thr125, Thr128, and Ser30 are not conserved among different Rattus synaptotagmin isoforms (Figure B) and thus are likely isoform specific. The lack of detected phosphorylation
of Thr112 and Thr125 is likely due to the lack of required kinases
in insect cells and/or a low fraction of insect cell-expressed Syt1
phosphorylated at these sites.

Glycosylation
We detected O-glycosylation of Thr26
(Figure A), which is a new O-glycosylation
site. We did not detect O-glycosylation
at the previously reported sites, Thr15 and Thr16,() which is not surprising because O-glycosylation of Thr15
and Thr16 requires the presence of synaptobrevin.() Analogous to the previously reported O-glycosylation sites
Thr15 and Thr16 and N-glycosylation site Asn24, the newly detected
O-glycosylation site Thr26 is not conserved among Syt isoforms (Figure B). Our mass spectrometry data did not show N-glycosylation
of the previously reported Asn24 site that was detected for Syt1 obtained
from synaptic vesicles, PC12 cells, and COS-7 cells, with N-glycan
complexity varying between expression sources.− The presence
of some form of N-glycans on Hi5 insect cell-expressed Syt1 cannot
be excluded because we have not used mass spectrometry methods that
would allow detection of complex N-glycans. To test whether N-glycosylation
is present in Hi5 insect cell-expressed Syt1, we treated purified
Syt1 with PGNase F (Figure D). Purified Syt1
shows three bands in the ∼65 kDa region, and only the faint
top band disappears after incubation with PGNase F (Figure D), suggesting that a small fraction of Syt1 could
be N-glycosylated. Interestingly, analogous to the observed differences
in N-glycosylation of Syt1 among different mammalian expression sources,− the level of N-glycosylation of Syt1 in insect cells also varies
with the expression source: for Sf9 cell expression,
approximately half of Syt1 is N-glycosylated (compare Figure S6C and
Figure S6D of ref ()). Furthermore, differences in glycosylation pathways between insect
and mammalian cell lines have been previously described.()

Comparison of the Lipid Binding Profile of Insect Cell-Expressed
Syt1 and E. coli-Expressed Syt1-C2AB and Syt3-C2AB
Fragments
Synaptotagmin isoforms Syt1 and Syt3 bind anionic
lipids, phosphatidylserine
(PS) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2], in
a Ca2+-dependent manner via the Ca2+-binding
loops of the C2 domains.,, In addition, the Syt1-C2AB fragment binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 in a Ca2+-independent manner via its lysine rich region of the C2B
domain.,, Both PS and
PtdIns(4,5)P2 are enriched in the synaptic plasma membrane and are
therefore poised to interact with Syt1 and participate in synaptic
vesicle–plasma membrane interaction and fusion. In light of
reports about the role of Syt1 in synaptic vesicle, and Syt3 in multivesicular body() endocytosis
and recycling, processes in which a different set of anionic lipids
is likely involved,() we screened for other
potential lipid binding partners of synaptotagmin isoforms Syt1 and
Syt3 (Figure ). In addition, to determine
if the previously uncharacterized full-length Syt1 binds lipids different
from the isolated C2AB fragment (residues 96–421), we compared
lipid binding profiles of insect cell-expressed full-length Syt1 and E. coli-expressed Syt1-C2AB and Syt3-C2AB fragments using
two different lipid binding assays, the lipid overlay assay (Figure ) and the biosensor assay (Figure ). Using a lipid overlay
assay, an array of single-lipid species was simultaneously tested
for interaction with a protein of interest (Figure A), thus allowing rapid screening of protein–lipid
interaction with a large number of different classes of lipids. We
tested the interaction of full-length Syt1 and Syt1-C2AB and Syt3-C2AB
fragments with 26 lipids from different lipid classes (sterols, sphingolipids,
and phospholipids) in the presence and absence of Ca2+.
Using a biosensor assay, a protein of interest tethered to an array
of biosensors was simultaneously assayed for its interaction with
an array of liposomes containing a single target lipid species and
lipids found in plasma and synaptic vesicle membranes, that is, lipids
that are the in vivo lipid membrane milieu of Syt (Figure A).

shows a representative example of a lipid strip from a lipid overlay

fragment (for full names of lipid acronyms, see below). Each dark
spot on the strip corresponds to a Syt1-C2AB fragment bound to a single
lipid species. (B) Lipid binding profile of full-length Syt1 and Syt1-C2AB

or fluorescence intensities of all spots on Lipid Strips were integrated
and corrected for background intensities. The shown intensities are
in arbitrary units (AU). The reproducibility of lipid binding was
tested for a subset of lipids: error bars represent standard deviations
from means of two or three independent experiments. Abbreviations:

in the presence of Ca2+ (left sensogram) and streptavidin

(middle sensogram) and presence (right sensogram) of Ca2+. We measured interactions between C2AB fragments of Syt3, Syt1,
Syt1 Arg398Glu/Arg399Glu (Syt1-C2AB RR), and Syt1 Lys326Glu/Lys327Ala
(Syt1-C2AB KK) with liposomes containing PC, PE, SM, cholesterol,

phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols [PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, PtdIns5P,

fragments, respectively, captured by streptavidin biosensors. The

KK and Syt1-C2AB RR mutants with the lipids in the absence (D) and
presence (E) of Ca2+.

The lipid overlay assay showed that, in addition
to the previously
reported Ca2+-dependent binding of Syt1 to anionic lipids
PS and PtdIn(4,5)P2, both full-length insect cell-expressed Syt1 and
the E. coli-expressed Syt1-C2AB fragment bind to
PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, PtdIns5P, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and sulfatide in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (Figure B). The
main differences in anionic lipid biding between the Syt1-C2AB fragment
and full-length Syt1 are in the Ca2+-dependent binding
of full-length Syt1 to gangliosides (GM1 and GD3) and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.
Thus, interaction of full-length Syt1 with GM1, GD3, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3
lipids might occur through Syt1’s luminal, transmembrane, and/or
membrane proximal regions, through the linker (residues 69–95),
or it might be due to the post-translational modifications in the
C2AB domain. The amount of Syt1 bound to PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns5P
in the presence of Ca2+ using the lipid overlay assay exceeded
the amount bound to PS and PtdIns(4,5)P2.

We compared the lipid
binding profile of the Syt1-C2AB fragment
with that of Syt3; Syt3's physiological function is yet unknown, but
Syt3 shares many biochemical properties,, with Syt1. With the exception of sulfatide, the C2AB
fragments of Syt1 and Syt3 interact with the same lipids, although
the extent of binding differs in several cases (Figure B). The Syt3-C2AB fragment binds both PtdIns3P and PtdIns5P
in a Ca2+-dependent manner, but less well than Syt1.

Because the lipid overlay assay was performed at a single time
point and at a single concentration of lipids, it is uncertain whether
Syt–lipid interactions have reached equilibrium and if the
observed difference in the extent of binding of Syt to different anions
has different affinities or different on or off rates. In addition,
the observed extent of binding of Syt to various lipids can be due
to the spatial arrangement of lipid charges in this assay, which is
likely different than the one in liposomes composed of multiple lipid
species. For the lipid overlay assay, patches of lipid contain 100%
of the lipid species of interest (Figure A),
which results in dense packing of lipids and, consequently, dense
packing of lipid charges. This spatial arrangement of charge is likely
different from that in liposomes composed of multiple lipid species.
Liposomes usually contain a few percent of anionic lipids that, in
the absence of liquid–liquid or liquid–solid phase separation,
diffuse in the plane of the bilayer and mix with other lipids. Consequently,
the local concentration, in the absence of phase separation, of any
individual lipid is typically relatively low, and in the case of charged
lipids, the charges are likely dispersed.

To compare how the
lipid binding profile shown in Figure  compares
to a situation in which anionic charges
are dispersed and present at physiological concentrations in liposomes
containing other lipids, we repeated the lipid binding assay using
liposomes (for a subset of anionic lipids identified in Figure ). Anionic lipids, PS, PtdIns, and various phosphorylated
PtdIns’s at physiologically comparable concentrations, were mixed with other lipids at ratios and identities corresponding
to the composition of synaptic vesicles, and Table . The C2AB fragments of Syt1 and Syt3 were tethered
to the biosensors in a site specific manner, and binding of liposomes
to the biosensors in the presence and absence of Ca2+ was
evaluated at a set time point. Syt1 and Syt3-C2AB domains interact
with the same lipids as in the lipid overlay assay in the presence
of Ca2+. The two lipid binding assays mostly differ in
detection of Ca2+-independent interactions, especially
in the case of PtdInsP2s and PtdInsP3 (Figure B,C) where binding to these lipids is prominent when they are packed
less tightly in the context of liposomes.

We tested which previously
identified lipid biding regions of Syt1
[the Ca2+-binding loops, the Lys rich region (residues
324–327) of the C2B domain, or the Arg398 and Arg399 residues
of the C2B domain,] are involved in binding to the
lipids used in our screen. We compared PS, PtdIns, PtdInsPs, PtdInsP2s,
and PtdInsP3 binding profiles for the Syt1-C2AB fragment with the
lipid biding profiles of the Syt1-C2AB Lys326Glu/Lys327Ala and Arg398Glu/Arg399Glu
mutants (Figure D,E). In the absence of Ca2+, we detected binding of wild-type protein and both mutants
only to phosphorylated PtdIns and not PS (Figure D). However, in the absence of Ca2+, the Lys326Glu/Lys327Ala
mutant binds phosphorylated PtdIns's less well than the wild type
while the Arg398Glu/Arg399Glu mutant binds them to the same degree
or slightly better. In the presence of Ca2+, the wild-type
protein and both mutants bind to both PS and phosphorylated PtdIns's
with the exception of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Furthermore, both the Lys326Glu/Lys327Ala
and Arg398Glu/Arg399Glu mutants bind PS, PtdInsP, and PtdInsP2 as
well as the wild type (Figure E). Thus, areas
other than the Ca2+-binding loops are involved in Ca2+-independent binding of Syt1 and the phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides
used in our screen (Figure D), while binding
in the presence of Ca2+ to PS and phosphorylated phosphatidylinositides
is predominantly mediated through Ca2+-binding loops (Figure E). Both observations are consistent with previously
reported interactions of the Syt1-C2AB fragment with PtdIns(4,5)P2.,,

Discussion
We showed that mammalian full-length Syt1
can be expressed and
purified from insect cells and performed an extensive characterization
of the post-translational modifications and lipid binding properties
of the purified protein. We found both previously described and several
new post-translational modifications and lipid binding partners. Syt1
binds anionic phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner
by coordinating Ca2+ between its Ca2+-binding
loops and anionic phospholipid headgroups.() The two anionic phospholipids with which Syt1 has been previously
shown to interact in a Ca2+-dependent manner, PS and PtdIns(4,5)P2,, are both enriched in the inner leaflet of the synaptic plasma membrane.
Syt1 has also been reported to interact in a Ca2+-independent
manner with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3,() a lipid
also enriched in the plasma membrane.()

We performed lipid binding assays in two contexts: one in
which
single lipid species were tightly packed and the other in which anionic
lipids were dispersed among other lipids. Tight packing might be similar
to a situation in which lipids would be located in lipid domains within
cell membranes, while the latter lipid arrangement is similar to a
situation in which anionic lipids are spaced far from one another.
Interestingly, in both settings, binding of Syt1 to several phosphorylated
phosphatidylinositides is stronger than binding to PS or PtdIns(4,5)P2.
Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and its phosphorylated derivatives [PtdIns3P,
PtdIns4P, PtdIns5P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] comprise ∼10% of the total cell lipids. Their
enrichment in cell organelles is highly specific and dynamic and is
maintained by phosphorylation of inositol at positions −3,
−4, and/or −5 by different classes of PtdIns kinases.() PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 have been
shown to be enriched in the plasma membrane; PtdIns4P is enriched
in the Golgi but can also be found in the plasma membrane, while PtdIns3P
and PtdIns(3,5)P2 are enriched in early and late endosomes where they
play a role in trafficking of these organelles.()

Binding of Syt1 to phosphorylated PtdIns enriched
in the plasma
membrane [PtdIns4P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3]
likely reflects Syt1’s role in synaptic vesicle exocytosis.
Binding to non-plasma membrane PtdIns's [PtdIns3P, PtdIns5P, PtdIns(3,4)P2,
and PtdIns(3,5)P2] reported here may play a role in synapototagmin-mediated
synaptic vesicle recycling. Syt1, in addition to being the primary
Ca2+ sensor for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release,
is also necessary for endocytosis of synaptic vesicles.() The role of synaptotagmin in endocytosis seems
to be conserved across species because it is observed in plants,() nematodes,() insects,() and mammals.() The
mechanism of Syt1-mediated endocytosis is poorly understood; it is
sensitive to Ca2+ concentration() and thought to involve AP2–clathrin interactions() and/or AP2-independent interactions involving
Syt1’s C-terminal domain.() While
PtdIns(4,5)P2 is required for the formation of the clathrin coat,
pinching of the recycled vesicle from the plasma membrane requires
destruction of PtdIns(4,5)P2.() Thus, it
is possible that Syt1’s association with endosomal phosphorylated
PtdIns plays a role in the synaptic vesicle recycling mechanism.

Syt1 and Syt3 C2 domains share many biochemical properties with
regard to the interaction with SNARE proteins, PS-containing lipid
membranes, SNARE-mediated lipid mixing, and membrane bending.,,, However, Syt3 is not involved in fast neurotransmitter release,() and its role in neurons is currently unknown.
It is therefore important to expand the biochemical characterization
of the Syt3-C2AB fragment and detect differences between lipid interactions
of Syt1 and Syt3. Similar to those with Syt1, interactions of the
Syt3-C2AB fragment with phosphorylated PtdIns likely point to its
role in vesicle recycling. As a case in point, Syt3 is the only synaptotagmin
isoform found in T cells where it is localized to multivesicular bodies
and is reported to control recycling of CXCR4 through multivesicular
bodies, thus controlling chemokine-induced T cell migration.() Interestingly, we find (Figure D,E) that the mode of interaction of the Syt1-C2AB fragment
with phosphorylated PtdIns is conserved: in the absence of Ca2+, the primary site of interaction is the lysine rich region
in the C2B domain (Lys324–Lys327) with a minor contribution
from Arg398 and Arg399, while in the presence of Ca2+,
the Ca2+-binding loops seem to primarily interact with
singly and doubly phosphorylated PtdIns. Our data are consistent with
previously characterized interaction of Syt1 with PtdIns(4,5)P2.,,

Using a lipid overlay assay,
we observed an interaction of full-length
Syt1 but not of the Syt1-C2AB fragment with the gangliosides used
in our screen, GM1 and GD3, suggesting that either the luminal region,
the transmembrane domain, residues 69–95 of the unstructured
linker, or post-translational modifications of the C2AB domain mediate
this interaction. Although direct interaction between Syt1 and gangliosides
has not been previously reported, the Syt1–ganglioside interaction
is physiologically relevant because botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B)
gains entry into cells by binding Syt1 only in the presence of gangliosides.() Although gangliosides might be interacting with
several regions on Syt1, the interaction is likely mediated via Syt1
luminal and/or transmembrane domains on the basis of the following.
First, the Syt1-BoNT/B binding site is located on the luminal/transmembrane
domain of Syt1, and gangliosides are necessary for that interaction., Second, the luminal domain of Syt1 faces the same membrane leaflet
in which gangliosides are preferentially located (extracytoplasmic
leaflet of the plasma membrane).

We have also identified an
interaction of Syt1 with sulfatides.
Sulfatides are highly enriched in myelin sheets and are not abundant
in other tissues. During myelogenesis in oligodendrocytes, Syt7,() not Syt1, is a likely Ca2+ sensor
during lysosomal exocytosis and endocytic recycling of the oligodendroglial
plasma membrane. Our lipid binding assay shows that Syt1, not Syt3,
binds sulfatide in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Because of
the different localization of sulfatides relative to Syt1, sulfatide
binding to Syt1 likely is not physiologically relevant and reflects
charge architecture requirements for Syt1–anionic lipid binding.

We found that Syt1 can be nitrated at 6 of 11 surface-exposed tyrosine
residues, three in the C2A domain (Tyr151, Tyr216, and Tyr229) and
three in the C2B domain (Tyr311, Tyr364, and Tyr380), and that Syt
might contain nitrated tyrosines in vivo. Tyrosine nitration has not
been previously reported for any synaptotagmin isoform, while other
proteins involved in synaptic vesicle fusion, syntaxin1A,() NSF,() and potentially
SNAP25,,, but not synaptobrevin
2,() have been found to be S-nitrosylated.

Nitration and nitrosylation play a role in modulation of synaptic
transmission/exocytosis under both normal and pathological conditions.
Nitric oxide (NO) modulates long-term potentiation (LTP), a mechanism
thought to be responsible for learning and memory formation in the
brain, by acting as a retrograde secondary messenger from the postsynaptic
to presynaptic neuron. Its role is still unclear because some studies
suggest that NO’s presence is required for the induction of
LTP, while other reports suggest that its presence
reduces the magnitude of LTP.() In addition
to the potential role of nitric oxide in LTP, increased levels of
protein nitration and nitrosylation have been observed in brain tissue
from patients with neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s)
as well as diabetes. The molecular mechanism by which synaptic protein
nitration and nitrosylation are connected with LTP and neurodegenerative
diseases is unknown. Interestingly, S-nitrosylation of syntaxin at
Cys145 disrupts its interaction with Munc18, but not with its SNARE
complex partners, SNAP25 and synaptobrevin., Treatment with NO slightly increases the extent of formation of
the SNARE complex both in vitro and in rat hippocampal synaptosomes,() while NSF nitrosylation has an inhibitory effect
on SNARE disassembly and exocytosis.()

Tyr311 that we found to be nitrated is located close to the lysine
rich region of the C2B domain (residues 324–327) that has been
implicated in interaction with phosphorylated inositides.,,, In D. melanogaster’s Syt1 (Tyr364Asn in D. melanogaster), the Tyr311Asn mutation decreases the amount
of exocytosis at Drosophila’s neuromuscular
junction. The decrease in the amount of exocytosis may be caused by
affecting oligomerization of Syt,, Syt1’s
Ca2+ affinity,() and/or the
Syt1–syntxin/SNAP-25 interaction.() In addition to its effect on Ca2+-triggered exocytosis
and Syt1–syntaxin/SNAP-25 interaction, the Tyr311Asn mutant
partially inhibits Syt1 endocytosis in PC12 cells;() thus, nitration of Tyr311 might have an effect on synaptic
vesicle recycling.

The second nitrated residue in C2B, Tyr364,
is a part of the Ca2+-binding motif and is partially conserved
among synaptotagmin
isoforms (Figure B). Nitration of the Tyr364
side chain could potentially change the conformation of the Ca2+-binding loop and alter Ca2+ binding. Tyr364 is
located between Asp363 and Asp365, and mutation of these residues
(corresponding to D. melanogaster Asp416Asn and Asp418Asn)
abolished C2B domain-mediated Ca2+ triggering of synchronous
synaptic vesicle fusion.() Sequence comparison
of Syt isoforms (Figure B) shows that the
same synaptotagmin isoforms (Syt4, Syt8, Syt11–Syt13, and Syt15)
that do not have a tyrosine residue at position 364 (that have been
either shown or predicted not to bind Ca2+ via the Ca2+-binding loops,) bind anionic lipids
and the syntaxin/SNAP-25 complex in a Ca2+-independent
manner and inhibit SNARE-mediated lipid mixing in vitro.()

The third nitrated C2B residue, Tyr380,
is located in the loop
leading to the proposed SNARE interaction helix() on the side of the C2B domain opposite from Ca2+-binding loops, thus potentially modulating the Syt1–SNARE
interaction. Tyrosines that are nitrated in the C2A domain, Tyr151
and Tyr216, are clustered together opposite of the Ca2+-binding loops while Tyr229 is very close to the Ca2+-binding
loop, and nitration could potentially change the conformation of the
loop. Tyr229 is adjacent to Asp230 and in the vicinity of Asp232 (corresponding
to D. melanogaster Asp282 and Asp284), mutations
of which abolish C2A-mediated Ca2+-triggered suppression
of asynchronous synaptic vesicle fusion.() Finally, the Syt1 tyrosine nitrations reported here could alter
its Ca2+-mediated interactions with anionic lipid and/or
SNARE and other proteins, thus modulating Ca2+-triggered
synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis.

Several studies suggest
that phosphorylation can modulate neurotransmitter
release,− although the role of Syt1 phosphorylation at the
previously characterized in vitro sites (Thr112, Thr128, and Thr125)
is unknown. Following stimulation with K+ depolarization
or phorbol esters in PC12 cells and in rat synaptosomes, the fraction
of Syt1 phosphorylated at Thr112 increased,() whereas in chromaffin cells, mutations of Thr112, Thr125, and Thr128
had no detectable effect on exocytosis.() However, the effect of phosphorylation on exocytosis may be subtle
because only a small fraction of total Syt1 is phosphorylated in vivo.() We have detected phosphorylation at two sites
in Syt1: the previously reported Thr128 site() and the new Ser30 site. The previously reported Thr112, Thr125,
and Thr128 phosphorylation sites are located in the linker region
between transmembrane and Ca2+-binding C2 domains, while
the new Ser30 phosphorylation site is located in the luminal Syt1
domain. Consequently, the potential physiological role of Syt1 phosphorylation
at Ser30 is likely different from that for the other phosphorylation
sites.

The N-terminal luminal domain of Syt1, containing both
N- and O-glycosylation
sites, is highly conserved across species,() although it is not conserved among different synaptotagmin isoforms.
For Syt1, both O-glycosylation and N-glycosylation regulate Syt1’s
localization to exocytic vesicles., The newly identified
O-glycosylation site at Thr26 might be specific for insect cell expression,
so characterization of Syt1 purified from natural sources will be
required.

In summary, we expressed and purified mammalian Syt1
in insect
cells at levels amenable to biochemical studies and characterized
the purified protein in unprecedented detail. We have shown that mammalian
Syt1 expressed and purified in insect cells is properly folded and
carries post-translational modifications already identified in mammalian
cells along with a new post-translational modification of Syt1, tyrosine
nitration, and new phosphorylation and O-glycosylation sites. In addition,
we have expanded the panel of anionic lipids with which Syt1 and Syt3
interact. We found that interaction of the Syt1-C2AB fragment with
different anionic lipids is conserved and mediated by the same regions
in the C2AB fragment. Ca2+-independent interactions seem
to be primarily mediated via a lysine rich region in the C2B domain
with a minor contribution from Arg398 and Arg399, while Ca2+-dependent interactions are primarily mediated via the Ca2+-binding loops. In conclusion, insect cell-expressed full-length
mammalian Syt1 should be a useful tool for further elucidation of
the functional roles of Syt1, its post-translational modifications,
and its interactions with various lipid and protein binding partners
in the synaptic vesicle cycle.
