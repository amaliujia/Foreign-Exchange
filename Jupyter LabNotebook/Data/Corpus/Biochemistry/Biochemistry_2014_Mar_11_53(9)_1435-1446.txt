Cytochrome
P450 (CYP) enzymes
activate molecular dioxygen for hydroxylation of a diverse library
of substrates, many of which are saturated alkanes with low reactivity.
Almost all P450s must accept electrons from redox partners containing
flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or FeS cofactors to initiate and complete
monooxygenase activity. P450s have traditionally been divided into
two classes depending on the type and organization of their redox
partners. Class I enzymes consist of multiple redox partners where
NAD(P)H-derived electrons are successively ferried to the P450 heme
through a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) flavoprotein and a [2Fe-2S]
iron–sulfur cluster ferredoxin. Class I systems are predominately
found in prokaryotes, although they also are present in vertebrate
mitochondria where the cytosolic ferredoxin, adrenodoxin (Adx), shuttles
electrons from membrane-tethered adrenodoxin reductase (Adr) to a
number of membrane-bound CYPs. Most mammalian microsomal P450s fall
into type II, which are present at the highest concentrations in the
liver and adrenal glands, where they are responsible for xenobiotic
clearance and steroid biogenesis. These P450s are membrane-bound and
accept electrons from membrane-bound cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)
that contains FAD and FMN redox cofactors.

We now know that
the class I versus class II definition is too
limited, and various combinations have been discovered. The P450cin system is one of these outliers, having an FMN-containing flavodoxin redox
partner instead of a 2Fe-2S ferredoxin. The sequence of cindoxin (Cdx)
is 37% homologous to those of both the human CPR-FMN domain and bacterial fusion protein XplA. To date, there have been only three crystal structures
of a P450 in a complex with its redox partner determined: the FMN-heme
domains of P450BM3, the Adx–CYP11A1
complex, and the recent Pdx–P450cam
structures., The Adx–CYP11A1 and P450BM3 FMN-heme
crystal structures exhibited few differences compared to the isolated
domains. However, a large structural change was observed in the Pdx–P450cam
X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures. These two structures are consistent
with data gathered over many years supporting
the role of Pdx in promoting structural changes in P450cam necessary
for O2 activation, electron transfer, and product formation.
As a step toward elucidating the structural details of the Cdx–P450cin
complex, we have determined the structure of Cdx and used computer
simulations to develop a hypothetical model of the complex. This model
has been used to guide mutagenesis studies. We also have conducted
some initial experiments to determine if binding of Cdx to P450cin
results in structural changes similar to what has been observed in
the P450cam system.

Experimental Procedures
Cdx Six-His Cloning and
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
For
ease of purification, Cdx was cloned into the Pet22B vector as a C-terminal
six-His-tagged fusion protein. Briefly, Cdx was amplified with primers
containing NdeI (forward) and XhoI (reverse) restriction sites from
the Cdx-PcWori construct, kindly provided by J. DeVoss. The gel-purified
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product was then ligated into Pet28
cut with the same enzymes. The resulting construct, Cdx-Pet28, encoded
eight extra residues at the C-termini consisting of a Leu-Glu dipeptide
followed by a six-His tag. PIPE mutagenesis utilizing overlapping complementary 5′ primer ends was used
to amplify mutant constructs for all mutants. PCR proceeded with 28
cycles of denaturation at 95 °C followed by a combined extension
and annealing step at 68 °C for 30 s.

Expression, Purification,
and Characterization of Protein
Untagged PcWori-Cdx was expressed
and purified as described previously. The Cdx-Pet28 plasmid was chemically transformed
into DE3 BL21 Star (Invitrogen) and plated overnight at 37 °C
on Luria-Bertani broth agar plates. A single colony was used to inoculate
100 mL of overnight 2×YT culture, and 5 mL of overnight culture
was used to inoculate 1 L of Terrific Broth (7 L total). The cultures
were grown at 225 rpm and 37 °C to a final OD600 of
1–1.5. The temperature was decreased to 30 °C and the
rate of shaking to 125 rpm. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) was not added because small scale trials showed much higher
protein yields from noninduced cells. The cells were centrifuged 17–24
h later and pellets stored at −80 °C. Cell pellets were
then thawed and resuspended in 300 mL of lysis buffer containing 50
mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 50 mM KCl, 2 μg/mL apostatin, 2
μg/mL pepstatin, 20 μg/mL trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mM PMSF,
10 mM MgCl2, 0.7 g of lysozyme, and 10 μg/mL DNase.
Cells were spun on a magnetic stirrer for 1 h at 4 °C, sonicated,
and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded over nickel-NTA superflow
resin (Clontech). Cdx does not bind very tightly, and the column was
washed with 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM KCl and
only 5 mM imidazole. Buffer containing 50 mM imidazole was used for
elution. Yellow fractions were pooled and diluted 2-fold with sodium
phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mM KCl, and 2 mM DTT and loaded directly onto
a DEAE-Sepharose FastFlow (GE Healthcare) drip column. The column
was washed in the buffer described above with 200 mM KCl and eluted
in 250 mM KCl. Fractions with an A415/A280 ratio of &gt;0.3 were pooled and concentrated
in an Amicon 10 kDa molecular mass cutoff filter unit (Millipore).
Protein to be used for crystallography was then loaded onto a Superdex
26/60 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column and run at a rate of 1
mL/min in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5). Samples consisting of a single
band on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and with an A415/A280 ratio of &gt;0.35 were subsequently pooled and concentrated.
Untagged Cdx was expressed and purified analogously with the following
exceptions. IPTG was added when the temperature was reduced to 30
°C, and the lysate was loaded directly onto DEAE resin followed
by a second identical DEAE purification.

Characterization of Cdx
The FMN content was determined
by adding 20 μL of 10% SDS to 10 μM Cdx in 1 mL of 50
mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) and measuring the concentration of free FMN
using an ε450 of 12.2 mM–1 cm–1. Both the wild type
and mutants had a UV–vis peak at 456 nm with a shoulder characteristic
of FMN-bound enzymes. The A450/A357 absorbance ratio was 1.1–1.2, consistent
with previous results. The peak at 456
nm was readily bleached upon reduction with excess dithionite in the
wild-type and mutant enzyme, indicating reduction of the FMN cofactor.
Our A280/A456 ratio was never above 0.38 in contrast to a previously reported
value of 0.67. Repeated attempts to introduce
excess FMN failed to increase this ratio. However, our calculated
ε456 of 10.8 mM–1 cm–1 was identical to that calculated previously, and gave a range of 95–99% FMN incorporation. All calculations
were performed using the yellow, fully oxidized form of the enzyme.

Cloning, Expression, Purification, and Characterization of P450cin
Although P450cin is expressed robustly in a PcWori vector used
previously,, we often had problems performing
PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. In many instances, the N-terminal
portion of the P450cin gene was deleted while the rest of the vector
remained intact. We believe this may be due to a calculated propensity
to form a hairpin between the N-terminus of P450cin and the flanking
PcWori vector sequence predicted using the Integrated DNA Technology
oligo analyzer tool. We therefore performed PCR to amplify P450cin
with NdeI and HindIII restrictions sites using the forward primer
GA GGT CAT ATG ACA AGT CTG TTC ACC ACC GCC and the reverse
primer GGA AAG CTT TCA TTC CGA CAG TCG CTTG. Restriction
sites are shown in bold. The PCR product was gel purified and ligated
into the Pet23a vector (Invitrogen) cut with NdeI and HindIII restriction
enzymes. A stop codon at the end of the coding sequence ensured an
untagged enzyme. P450cin was expressed and purified as described previously with the following modifications. Pet23a-P450cin
was transformed into chemically competent BL21 DE3 cells (Invitrogen)
and induced at 22 °C with 1 mM IPTG. The heme precursor, δ-aminolevulinic
acid (200 μM), was also added, and the rate of shaking was set
to 120 rpm for 36 h. Wild-type and mutant P450cin had an A280/A392 ratio between 1.2
and 1.3 in the presence of excess substrate. Protein concentrations
were calculated using a substrate-bound ε392 of 132
mM–1 cm–1. The heme content was estimated to be &gt;95% using a standard alkaline
pyridine hemochromogen assay and an εred557 of 34.7 mM–1 cm–1 for a type B heme.

Crystal Growth, Data Collection, and Refinement
of a Cdx Surface
Entropy Reduction Mutant
The Cdx surface entropy reduction
triple mutant (E134A/E135A/E138A), here termed SER-Cdx, containing
a C-terminal six-His tag fusion was purified as described above. Protein
was concentrated to 1.5 mM in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5). Crystals were set
up in EasyXtal 15-well hanging drop crystal trays (Qiagen). The wells
contained 250 μL of 100 mM Hepes (pH 7) and 1.7–2.1 M
ammonium sulfate. The drops consisted of 1 μL of protein mixed
with 1 μL of well solution. Crystals were bright yellow and
hexagonally shaped, growing from yellow droplets over a period of
3–5 days. Intensity data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron
Radiation Lightsource (Menlo Park, CA) on beamline 7-1 using a Q315R
detector. Intensities were integrated and scaled using HKL2000, and
the space group was determined to be P3221 (Table ). Initial phases were not readily
determined using the CPR FMN domain (FMN-CPR) as a search model, or
upon conversion to polyalanines despite the high level of sequence
identity (37%). Therefore, we used Sculptor to provide a better phasing model for molecular replacement. A Cdx-FMN-CPR
sequence alignment file was fed into Sculptor implemented in the Phenix
package along with the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) file of the CPR-FMN domain without the FMN cofactor (PDB entry 1B1C). Sculptor performs
a series of steps, including pruning and morphing of particular model
side chains as well as B factor smearing to increase
the level of agreement between the model and the target. Thereafter,
phases were easily determined by molecular replacement using Phaser. Individual coordinates were refined with anisotropic B factors for protein and the FMN cofactor, while water B factors were refined isotropically. A summary of data
collection and refinement statistics is presented in Table .

Catalytic Activity As Determined by NADPH Turnover
NADPH
turnover assays were performed at room temperature on a Cary
3E UV–visible spectrophotometer. An established reconstituted
assay was used to measure NADPH consumption, in which cindoxin reductase is replaced by Escherichia coli flavodoxin reductase (Fldr). In this reconstituted system, NADPH-derived
electrons are transferred from Fldr to Cdx and then to P450cin for
1,8-cineole hydroxylation. For the Y96L mutant and the SER-Cdx mutant,
10 μM Fldr, 4 μM Cdx, and 0.25 μM P450cin were mixed
in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 1 mM 1,8-cineole. NADPH turnover
was initiated by adding NADPH from a 20 mM stock solution at a final
concentration of 400 μM. In all cases, control reactions were
performed in cineole-free buffer. NADPH consumption was followed by
the loss of absorbance at 340 nm and the rate determined by dividing
the slope of the curve by 6.22 mM–1 cm–1. Rates were subtracted from those of
control reactions conducted in buffer lacking cineole, and the kcat was determined by dividing by the micromolar
amount of P450cin used. In assays in which the concentrations of SER-Cdx
and Cdx Y96L mutants were increased 10-fold, control reactions also
had a 10-fold increase in these mutants to subtract background NADPH
consumption. The remaining mutants used in the NADPH activity screening
assays had varying redox partner ratios in addition to the appropriate
wild-type controls. The percent activity was determined by dividing
the kcat of the mutant by the kcat of the wild type. Assays that were preformed
three or more times are presented with error bars, while those performed
fewer times are presented without error bars.

Stopped-Flow OxyP450cin
Formation
A stock solution
of 2 mM P450cin was reduced by being titrated in a 100 mM stock of
sodium dithionite to a final concentration of 20 mM in anaerobic buffer
[50 mM KPi (pH 7.5) and 100 μM cineole] in an anaerobic
glovebox. After 30 min, the sample was passed over a PD10 desalting
column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer, giving a final
stock concentration of 160–200 μM. The exact concentration
and confirmation of the reduced form of P450cin (determined by a Soret
peak shift to 415 nm) were determined by UV–vis spectroscopy
of the diluted protein in an anaerobic cuvette using the ferrous substrate-bound
extinction coefficient (ε411 = 106 cm–1 mM–1). We have previously
shown that binding of oxygen to P450cin results in a shift in the
absorbance peak from 411 nm, characteristic of the Fe(II) state, to
418 nm, characteristic of the Fe(II)–O2 state. Oxygen binding and the subsequent decay were
followed by tracking the absorbance at 418 nm on an SX.18MV stopped-flow
apparatus (Applied Photophysics) upon rapid mixing of reduced P450cin
and oxygenated buffer [50 mM KPi (pH 7.5) and 100 μM
cineole] with and without Cdx. The syringes were kept at 4 °C
using a circulating water bath that cooled the syringes and reaction
cell. Final concentrations upon mixing were 10 μM Cdx, 5 μM
P450cin, and 100 μM cineole. The initial increase at 418 nm
occurs within 50 ms and was evident for shorter collection times of
2 s but not as obvious for log base collection times of 10 and 20
s used to follow the decay of the oxy complex. Curve fitting was performed
using IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Inc.) over a time interval of 100 ms to
10 s.

Stopped-Flow P450cin–Cdx Electron Transfer
Single-electron
transfer between P450cin and Cdx was conducted using an SX.18MV stopped-flow
apparatus (Applied Photophysics), in a manner similar to that described
previously with a few modifications.
Briefly, protein samples were degassed with repeated cycles of purging
with argon followed by degassing under vacuum. Samples and buffer
purged of oxygen were transferred to an anaerobic glovebox. Cdx (16
μM) was reduced in anaerobic buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate,
20 unirs/mL catalase, 20 units/mL glucose oxidase, and 1 mM glucose)
via titration in a solution of dithionite that was calibrated against
cytochrome c. The solution was intermittently placed
in an anaerobic cuvette and the UV–vis absorbance measured.
Titration was halted when the intensity of the 456 nm UV–vis
peak was reduced to approximately 0.02, leaving ∼1.85 μM
oxidized Cdx (ε456ox = 10.8 mM–1 cm–1). This gave
a total starting Cdx concentration of ∼14 μM and ensured
that there was no excess dithionite present. The anaerobic cuvette
was transferred back to the anaerobic chamber and drawn into a gastight
Hamilton syringe. P450cin was diluted to 10 μM in CO-saturated
buffer, giving final concentrations of 7 μM Cdx and 5 μM
P450cin upon mixing. It was assumed that electron transfer was rate-limiting,
and a single-exponential model was used to fit the data for the wild
type (&gt;0.5 s), the triple glutamate mutant (0.5 s), and the Y96L
mutant
(2 s). Graphs and calculations were generated using IgorPro.

Fldr–Cdx
Electron Transfer
The transfer of an
electron from Fldr to Cdx was assayed by following the decrease in
absorbance at 456 nm characteristic of a transition from oxidized
FMN to the reduced hydroquinone form. FAD-bound enzymes show a much
lower absorbance than FMN-bound enzymes, allowing us to use a concentration
of Fldr with no appreciable absorbance. This also had the effect of
sufficiently slowing the electron transfer rate for quantitation.
The absorbance of NADPH with a peak at 340 nm also does not overlap
with the flavin peak at 456 nm at the concentrations used in this
assay. Excess Cdx (20 μM) was mixed with a small amount of Fldr
(0.25 μM) in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.8). NADPH (200 μM)
was added to initiate the reaction, and the absorbance was measured
at 456 nm for 1.5 min using a Carry 3E UV–visible spectrophotometer.
The initial rates were estimated from the slope of the curves for
the first 20 s in which the curves were linear. kET was estimated by using an ε456ox of
10.8 mM–1 cm–1  and dividing the slope of the curve by the concentration
of the rate-limiting enzyme (Fldr).

Brownian Dynamics–MD
Docking
We generated an
atomistic model of the P450cin–Cdx complex using a combination
of Brownian dynamics (BD) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
The BD simulations were used to dock Cdx to P450cin, and a subsequent
MD simulation was used to refine a particular complex selected from
the BD trajectories. The approach we used is similar to that of Motiejunas
et al. except our BD simulations did
not include restraints derived from biochemical data. The BD method
that we employed models proteins as atomically detailed rigid bodies
and generates translational and rotational displacements using the
Ermak–McCammon algorithm. The
SDA program was used to conduct the BD
simulations. The SDA energy function, from which the forces that drive the BD simulations are derived,
contains four contributions: (1) interactions of the charges on one
protein with the electrostatic potential due to another protein, (2)
the electrostatic desolvation energy due to the charges on one protein
entering the low-dielectric cavity of another protein, (3) the nonpolar
desolvation energy due to the burial of the solvent-accessible surface
of atoms on one protein in the cavity of another protein, and the
(4) soft-core repulsion interactions between atoms on different proteins.
For the sake of computational efficiency, these energy contributions
are precomputed on cubic grids. The electrostatic potentials are obtained
by finite-difference solution of the nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann
equation using the APBS program package, in which the solvent is represented by a dielectric continuum. The
solvent dielectric constant was set to 78 with an ionic strength corresponding
to 50 mM NaCl.

Crystal structures of both the substrate-free
and substrate-bound forms of Cdx (PDB entries 4L77 and 4FMX, respectively) were
used in the BD simulations. Initial configurations were prepared by
placing the larger of the two proteins, P450cin, at the origin, where
it was kept fixed in place during the BD simulations, and the smaller
protein, Cdx, at a random position 300 Å away. The relative diffusion
constants for Cdx diffusion around the fixed P450cin were calculated
from diffusion constants for Cdx and P450cin, which were estimated
on the basis of the crystal structures using the Hypropro 10 package. Each BD trajectory was prolonged for 500 μs,
or until Cdx traveled 400 Å from the origin, at which point the
simulation was stopped. The simulation time step was changed from
20 to 1 ps when the separation between the two proteins was &lt;20
Å. For each system (substrate-free and substrate-bound Cdx),
20000 BD trajectories were generated.

The BD trajectories that
produced encounters between Cdx and P450cin
were clustered to identify a candidate complex to be refined with
an atomistic MD simulation. The clustering revealed that both substrate-free
and substrate-bound Cdx formed complexes with P450cin, although the
substrate–P450cin complex gave slightly better clustering,
so we chose the open form of P450cin for further analysis. We selected
the P450cin–Cdx complex that had the shortest substrate-free
Cdx flavin–P450cin heme distance, as well as the longest lifetime
among the 20000 BD trajectories.

The complex was immersed in
a rectangular box of water molecules
with initial dimensions of 127 Å × 118 Å × 149
Å. Following energy minimization, a 300 ps MD trajectory was
generated at a constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 bar) using
NAMD version 2.8. The lengths of bonds
to hydrogen atoms were held fixed using the SHAKE and SETTLE algorithms. The
equations of motion were integrated with a reversible, mutiple-step
algorithm with a time step of 2 fs for
electrostatic forces and 1 fs for bonded and short-range nonbonded
forces. The smooth particle mesh Ewald method with a fourth-order interpolation scheme was used to calculate the
electrostatic interactions, and the real-space contributions were
truncated at 12 Å. Nosé–Hoover–Langevin
pistons were used for pressure control,
and a Langevin dynamics scheme was used for temperature control. The
CHARMM22 force field was used for the
proteins, the TIP3P force field for water,
and the CGenFF force field for the FMN
cofactor.

Results
Analysis and Comparison
of the SER-Cdx Crystal Structure
Although there are various
P450cin structures available, including
substrate-bound, substrate-free, and nitric oxide-bound structures, the crystal structure of its redox partner,
Cdx, has remained elusive. After exhaustive crystallization trials,
we were not able to improve upon one-dimensional plates that gave
unusable highly anisotropic X-ray data. We therefore took advantage
of an approach used previously to promote crystal packing by reducing
the surface entropy.− We mutated Glu134, Glu135, and Glu138 to alanines
as directed by the Surface Entropy Reduction Prediction server (SERp)
at the University of California at Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA). The triple mutant readily yielded hexagonal
crystals that diffracted beyond 1.2 Å. The resolution was limited
by our particular choice of detector and not by the diffracting power
of the crystals. Crystals were highly ordered and well-packed and
belongs to space group P3221 (Table ).

The sequence of Cdx is similar to those
of human FMN-CPR, bacterial nitric oxide synthase, and sulfite reductase
FMN domains, as well as to those of other flavodoxins with levels
of sequence identity of &gt;39%. There are several highly conserved
regions
(Figure A), including the phosphate binding
loop (P-loop), the tyrosine-containing loops (Y1 and Y2 loops), and
the β-sheets proceeding these loops (β3 and β4).
The SER-Cdx (SER stands for surface entropy reduction) crystal structure
is shown in Figure B. The crystal structure
reflects the sequence conservation with an α–β–α
fold topology characteristic of all flavodoxins and FMN-CPR. Alternating
parallel β-strands (β2−β1−β3−β4−β5
arrangement) form a five-layer central core with standard interstrand
H-bonds between amide nitrogen and carbonyl carbons. The β-strands
sweep toward the FMN binding domains, while the α-helices run
in the opposite direction around the periphery of the protein. Helices
3 and 5 are completely α-helical, while helices 1, 2, and 4
are capped by shorter 310-helical segments.

the FMN binding pocket. (D) Stereo model showing key interactions
discussed in the text.

As expected, the overall structure of SER-Cdx is similar
to that
of FMN-CPR with a few notable differences. In agreement with other
bacterial flavodoxins, SER-Cdx does not have the extra N-terminal
helix that is present in FMN-CPR. Also, the partitioning of β5
into segments “a” and “b” does not occur
in Cdx like it does in FMN-CPR and most other bacterial flavodoxins.
Instead, a long loop travels from helix 5 to a short β5 strand
near the flavin. Some degree of conformational rigidity may be maintained
in this loop as the Gln118 ε-nitrogen H-bonds with the Thr122
γ-oxygen. In some “long chain” flavodoxins, this
loop is the site of an ∼20-amino acid insertion that is absent in Cdx.

FMN Binding Site
A high degree of sequence conservation
is evident in the loops surrounding the FMN cofactor (Y1, Y2, and
P) as well as many of the adjoining β-sheets and α-helices
(Figure ). This high degree of sequence conservation
is undoubtedly a result of specific protein–flavin interactions
in the FMN binding site depicted in panels B–D of Figure . The FMN cofactor is situated at the apex of five
pairs of β-strands and α-helices, making contacts with
the Y1 and Y2 loops. Three conserved aromatic residues, Tyr59, Tyr97,
and Phe100, play a prominent role in FMN binding (Figure ). The isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between
Y1 loop Tyr59 (bridging β3 and H3) and Y2 loop Tyr97 (bridging
β4 and H4). Try59 sits on the re side with
a 40° tilt with respect to the FMN plane, while Tyr97 resides
on the si side, making coplanar π–π
stacking interactions with the isoalloxazine ring. The analogous residues
are important for FMN binding in rat CPR. Tyr97 is universally conserved as a Tyr/Phe and has been shown to
influence the FMNsq/hq redox potential in Desulfovibrio
vulgaris. The sequence conservation
of the β4 sheet prior to the Y2 loop in Cdx is probably needed
to properly position Tyr97 over the isoalloxazine ring. In particular,
the highly conserved Thr58 H-bonds to the Ala103 amide nitrogen in
H4 via its hydroxyl group (Figure C). The
Thr58 carbonyl also H-bonds with FMN ribityl O2 while O3 points into
the solvent.

Y2 loop Phe100 is also conserved as an aromatic
Phe/Tyr and is close to the isoalloxazine ring but is too far for
significant stacking or van der Waals contacts. Despite this, Paine
et al. showed that mutations to Leu or Gln at this position result
in a 50% decrease in FMN binding affinity. In the same study, these mutants were shown to have significant
NMR backbone 1H and 15N chemical shifts for
helix and loop residues near the FMN binding site, even after correcting
for changes expected due to the loss of phenylalanine. These data
suggest that the conserved Phe/Tyr residue plays an indirect role
in FMN binding by positioning the Y2 loop for favorable interaction
with the FMN ring system.

H-Bonds between the protein and the
pyridine heteroatoms as well
as ribityl oxygen atoms are consistent with what is observed in other
flavodoxins as well as CPR-FMN. In particular,
the pyridine N1 and O2 atoms H-bond with Y2 loop backbone atoms (Thr99
and Asn101) analogous to that of human CPR-FMN. However, the Thr99
side chain hydroxyl makes an additional H-bond with the pyridine O4
atom that cannot be accomplished in FMN-CPR because of the His at
this position. The ribityl O4 atom H-bonds with side chains Asn13
(δ2 N atom) and Thr127 (hydroxyl group), which is similar to
what has been seen in CPR-FMN.

The FMN phosphate binding loop
(P-loop) connecting β1 and
H1 shows a high degree of sequence conservation and features H-bonding
between Thr9/Thr11 hydroxyls and phosphate oxygen atoms (Figure ). FMN phosphate–protein interactions may
also be stabilized by the amino end of the H1 dipole that terminates
adjacent to the negatively charged phosphate groups as previously
suggested for CPR-FMN. The high degree
of conservation of the Y1 loop, Thr58, and the β4 sheet creates
a loop-FMN structural relationship that is remarkably consistent when
overlaid with other FMN-binding proteins. Much of this conservation
is probably also important for establishing unique flavoprotein-FMN
redox potentials as previously discussed.,,

A superposition of FMN-CPR and Cdx
shows an expected strong degree
of structural homology between Cdx and FMN-CPR (Figure A). However, there are substantial deviations in the terminal
helices (H1 and H5) as well as the β2–H2 loop and H2
helix of Cdx. Note that the helix numbering used for Cdx is different
from that of FMN-CPR because of an extra N-terminal helix for the
latter, as well as defining a short three-residue α-helix as
a loop in Cdx. These are also regions with the lowest degree of sequence
homology. The triple-glutamate mutant crystallizes with a buried hydrophobic
patch between two molecules related by a 2-fold rotation (Figure B). This interaction is likely to be key in obtaining
high-quality diffracting crystals as the E134A and E135A single mutants
failed to crystallize. The E134A/E135A/E138A triple-mutant methyl
groups point into a hydrophobic core created by crystal packing at
the interface of the two molecules. E134A forms van der Waals contacts
with the same residue on its symmetry-related partner. E135A is buried
in the Ala16, Thr19, and Thr20 γ-carbons, while the E138A methyl
sits close to the Thr20 γ-carbon. The wild-type enzyme would
have exhibited abundant ionic repulsion under the same scenerio, making
crystallization in this packing configuration highly unlikely.

Redox partner interactions are governed by electrostatic
complementarity
where the electronegative surface of the flavoprotein pairs with the
electropositive portion of the P450. Cdx carries a high negative charge
with a theoretical pI of 4.06 as a consequence of having 23 acidic
residues and only seven basic amino acids. Furthermore, an APBS calculation
predicts a charge of −13e after in
silico mutation of the alanines back to glutamates. As with other P450 systems, the electronegative
surface surrounding the exposed edge of the FMN complements the electropositive
region on the proximal side of P450cin that is the closest approach
of the heme to the surface. To develop a model of the Cdx–P450cin
complex, we turned to a combined BD–MD simulation-based approach.
This approach provided a structural model giving us insight into specific
protein interactions and ultimately guided our structure–function
mutagenesis studies.

Cdx–P450cin Model
We used
a docking approach
combining BD and MD to generate an atomistic model of the Cdx–P450cin
complex. As described in , initial docking was conducted using rigid-body BD, and the complex
was refined by MD simulation, which samples the local side chain flexibility
not permitted in the BD simulations. The model generated by BD and
MD depicted in Figure  shows several hydrophobic
and complementary electrostatic contacts that are likely important
for complex formation. P450cin Arg346 and Cdx Asp94 form an interconnected
network of charge–polar interactions with each other and with
the FMN ligand (Figure B). Specifically, Arg346
forms a salt bridge with Asp94 and a charge–polar interaction
with the FMN ribityl hydroxyl group. Asp94, in turn, completes the
network by forming an amide nitrogen H-bond with the FMN ring O2 atom.
Asp94 may also play a general role in P450 redox recognition as it
is conserved across bacterial flavodoxins, although it is an Asn in
human CPR. Cdx Tyr96 protrudes into a hydrophobic cleft created by
P450cin Val105, Ala106, and Phe109 of helix C and loop CD, as well
as Leu348. Tyr96 also forms a π–π stacking interaction
with P450cin Arg102. In summary, the major interactions in our model
include a combination of electrostatic interactions between Arg346
and the FMN hydroxyl group/Cdx Asp94, and hydrophobic interactions
between P450cin and Cdx Tyr96.

Testing the Hypothetical
Model
We next generated a
series of mutants to test our hypothetical model. A summary of the
results is presented in Figure D and Table . In all, 15 single mutations near the FMN binding
site failed to show a marked reduction in catalytic activity. This
is reminiscent of a number of mutations made in FMN-CPR where mutating
only Asp148 gave a significant reduction (70%) in activity. Despite these modest effects, the Cdx triple
mutant used for crystallography reduced NADPH turnover activity by
92% of that of the wild type (the EEEA mutant in Figure D). This observation coupled with the fact that the single
mutants, E134A, E135A, and E138A, do not significantly effect activity
suggests that this region may provide a large electronegative patch
for initial nonspecific binding rather than being responsible for
particular interprotein electrostatic interactions.

The involvement of Cdx Tyr96 and P450cin Arg102 and
Arg346 in the
modeled complex interface prompted us to examine each mutant individually.
The Y96F mutant had near-wild-type NADPH turnover activity, suggesting
that the Tyr hydroxyl group is not important for binding. We next
tested the Y96L mutant. This mutant gives the characteristic flavoprotein
spectrum with an A280/A456 ratio almost identical to that of the wild type, indicating
that FMN binding is not compromised. The Y96L mutant, however, exhibits
a marked decrease in kcat by &gt;8-fold
from
847 to 96 min–1. However, increasing the Y96L Cdx
concentration to 40 μM (10-fold increase) increases activity
to ∼40% of the wild-type activity with a kcat of 353 min–1. This concentration
dependence on activity suggests that Y96L is involved in protein–protein
binding but is probably not critical to electron transfer.

We
also conducted stopped-flow kinetics to isolate the effect of
the Y96L mutant on the first electron transfer step between Cdx and
P450cin (Table ). The hydroquinone species
of Cdx transfers a single electron to P450cin to produce a ferrous
iron center that in the presence of CO gives the characteristic 450
nm Soret band. This characteristic allows us to easily use stopped-flow
spectroscopy to follow the first electron transfer to P450cin. Under these conditions, wild-type Cdx and the
Y96L mutant give rates (k) of ∼6.6 s–1 (χ2 = 4.4 × 10–5) and ∼2.1
s–1 (χ2 = 1.0 × 10–4), respectively. The difference in the two plots in Figure A clearly shows that the first electron transfer
is hampered in the Y96L mutant. However, this difference still cannot
account for the 8-fold reduction seen in NADPH turnover assays. We
therefore assayed the transfer of an electron from Fldr to Cdx to
discern whether part of the reduction in activity was due to impaired
recognition between these two proteins (Table ). The nature of this assay dictates that Fldr is limiting, so we
cannot directly compare rates between assays. However, we can discuss
relative rates as shown in Figure B. Wild-type
Cdx is reduced by Fldr at rate that is more than twice as fast (kET = 48.1 ± 5.7 min–1) as that of the Y96L mutant (kET = 18.8
2.9 ± min–1). The NADPH turnover assay utilizes
a large excess of Fldr, so it is unlikely that moderate differences
seen in the Fldr–Cdx assay (where Fldr is limiting) could explain
the large decrease in the rate of NADPH consumption for this mutant.
Because the effects of the Y96L mutant on the first electron transfer
are moderate, it is likely that the second electron transfer step
in which oxy-P450cin is reduced to give product is severely hampered.
Even so, it is possible that even with excess Fldr the rate of reduction
of Cdx remains close to 18.8 min–1, so that the
large decrease in the rate of NADPH turnover in the Y96L mutant is
due to the combined effect of both slow reduction and oxidation of
the Cdx Y96L mutant.

The P450cin R102A and R346A
mutants both showed substantial decreases
in NADPH turnover activity with kcat values
of 82.4 ± 13.7 and 44.0 ± 13.6 min–1,
respectively. Decreases in wild-type activity of 90% (R102A) and nearly
95% (R346A) support our model in which Arg102 forms π–π
base stacking interactions with Cdx Tyr96 and P450cin Arg346 ion pairs
with Cdx Asp94. Increasing the concentration of R102A P450cin 10-fold
restores activity to only ∼18% of that of the wild type, with
a kcat value of 154.4 ± 12.8 min–1. Increasing the R346A mutant concentration 20-fold
(5 μM) failed to give a measurable increase in the turnover
activity for the Arg346 mutant.

The glutamates in the SER-Cdx
mutant (E134, E136, and E138) used
for crystallization are not near the proposed interaction interface.
Given that the single-alanine mutants do not effect the activity,
it was plausible that the total net charge is important for an initial
nonspecific recognition but that a specific orientation is required
for electron transfer. However, despite a large decrease in NADPH
activity, the SER-Cdx mutant showed a rate constant similar to that
of the wild type (k ∼ 9.3 s–1; χ2 = 4.0 × 10–5) for the
first electron transfer (Figure A and Table ). In addition, the rate of transfer of electrons
from Fldr to Cdx is reduced by only 50% (Figure B and Table ). This observation leaves open
the possibility that the decreased kcat for NADPH turnover is due to a weakened ability to transfer the
second electron to oxy-P450cin, but it also is possible that on–off
rates important under steady state conditions have been altered.

Decay Kinetics of Oxy-P450cin
It has been known for
some time that the binding of oxidized Pdx to oxy-P450cam dramatically
decreases the stability of oxy-P450cam., This is very
likely due to Pdx favoring the more open conformation of P450cam in
which the O2 binding site is solvent-exposed., Given our docking results, we were interested in understanding if
a similar phenomenon occurs when Cdx binds to P450cin. Oxy-P450cin
is not nearly as stable as oxy-P450cam, but the decay of oxy-P450cin
can readily be followed using stopped-flow spectroscopy (Figure C). The spontaneous decay of oxy-P450cin is biphasic
with a kfast of 0.77 s–1 (t1/2 ∼ 0.9 s) and a kslow of 0.08 s–1 (t1/2 ∼ 8.5 s), with the slower rate accounting
for ∼75% of the reaction. In the presence of oxidized Cdx,
the rate of oxy-P450cin decay is monophasic with a k of 0.69 s–1 (t1/2 ∼
1 s). Therefore, Cdx decreases the stability of oxy-P450cin ∼10-fold,
while Pdx decreases the stability of oxy-P450cam 150-fold. We also found that the addition of Cdx to substrate-bound
P450cin, which is fully high-spin with a Soret band at 392 nm, does
not shift P450cin to the low-spin form with a Soret band at 418 nm.
In sharp contrast, the addition of Pdx to substrate-bound P450cam
shifts P450cam to the low-spin form. We
now know that this change is due to an active site opening that allows
water to enter and coordinate the heme iron. These results show that
Cdx must induce some changes that result in destabilization of the
oxy complex, but these changes are not large enough to allow water
to enter the active site and coordinate the heme iron. Therefore,
whatever structural changes Cdx may induce are modest compared to
those resulting from the binding of Pdx to P450cam.

Discussion
As expected, the crystal structure of Cdx is very similar to those
of related FMN proteins involved in P450 electron transfer. However,
one unique feature of Cdx is Tyr96, which extends out into solution.
This residue is a Thr in the FMN domain of mammalian CPR. The computer
docking studies predict that Tyr96 will be positioned between the
FMN of Cdx and heme of P450cin, and indeed, the mutagenesis studies
show that Tyr96 is quite important. Although the Y96L mutant has a
substantially reduced activity in steady state assays, the activity
does increase with an increasing mutant Cdx concentration, indicating
that the role of Tyr96 is primarily in binding and not electron transfer.
The docking studies also indicate that P450cin Arg346 and Arg102 are
important, and the mutagenesis supports these predictions. The effect
of the Arg102 mutant is complicated by the fact that this Arg also
interacts with a P450cin heme propionate. Arg346, however, extends
out into solution, so the functional effects of mutating Arg346 are
likely confined to Cdx binding and electron transfer. R346A exhibits
only 5% of the wild-type activity, and the activity remains low even
when the Cdx concentration is increased, indicating that Arg346 is
involved in more than just binding of Cdx. Precisely what additional
role Arg346 might play is open to speculation, but our computer-generated
model has Arg346 closely approaching the Cdx FMN and Asp94. Therefore,
it is possible that Arg346 plays an important role in electron transfer.

Interestingly, only the triple-Ala mutant affects the activity;
each individual mutation (E134A, E135A, or E138A) has little effect.
Our model also shows that these residues are not involved in direct
binding. The role of this large electronegative patch could be to
promote rapid formation of an electrostatically bound complex. This
could be followed by Cdx sampling the surface of P450cin until it
settles into a stable complex that is optimal for electron transfer.
However, the triple mutant delivers the first electron at approximately
the same rate as the wild type, so the decrease in steady state activity
is likely due to changes in the second electron transfer step, reduction
of oxy-P450cin to give the product.

Our results also indicate
that Cdx does not play the same major
effector role as Pdx does in the P450cam system. Cdx does not shift
P450cin from high-spin to low-spin, so unlike binding of Pdx to P450cam,
binding of Cdx is unlikely to cause a major closed-to-open conformational
change. Nevertheless, Cdx does increase the rate of decay of the oxy-P450cin
complex. Our docking model shows that Cdx very closely approaches
the heme thiolate ligand, and such a close approach should affect
the electronic properties of the thiolate ligand and coordinated ligands,
as has been observed when Pdx binds to P450cam. In addition, the optimal
computer docking model uses the substrate-free open conformation of
P450cin. The open-to-closed transition involves not only opening of
the substrate access channel but also structural changes at the Cdx
docking site. Thus, Cdx binding may favor binding to a partially open
state that destabilizes oxy-P450cin but is not sufficiently altered
to give the large changes in the active site observed in the fully
open P450cin structure. Subtle changes
in the local hydrogen bonds to the thiolate ligand could also contribute to stability changes.

Finally,
subtle differences between the P450cam and P450cin active
sites may explain why the former requires a greater effector role
with respect to its redox partner. A key amino acid in the proposed
effector function of P450cam is Asp251 (Figure ). This highly conserved Asp is critical to activity in P450cam,
and the corresponding Asp in P450cin, Asp241, is also essential. It is believed that the essential role of Asp251
is the delivery of protons from the solvent to the iron-linked dioxygen. Proton shuttling is important because it is
required for protonation of the distal O2 O atom to promote
O–O bond heterolysis and formation of Compound I. However,
Asp251 ion pairs with Lys178 and Arg189 in the closed conformation.
This strong ion pair would likely prevent Asp251 from shuttling protons
into the active site (Figure ). The ion pairs
are ruptured when Pdx binds, thus freeing Asp251 to serve its proton
shuttling function. The structure of P450cin in this region is substantially
different. Asp241 is not ion paired with any basic side chain but
instead is connected to bulk solvent via a continuous H-bonded network
involving His176 (Figure ). As a result, the
active site would not need to open to the extent observed in P450cam
to shuttle solvent protons into the active site. P450cin redox partner
binding may not play as significant a role in triggering the catalytic
machinery required for proton-coupled electron transfer.
