Iron–sulfur (Fe–S)
proteins are among the most ancient of macromolecules. They are involved in various biochemical processes, including
nitrogen fixation, metabolic catalysis, regulation of gene expression,
and electron transfer.− The major pathway for Fe–S cluster biosynthesis,
the ISC pathway, is highly conserved across the many species in which
it occurs. Defects in this machinery underlie
many human diseases and aging processes.−

IscU (Isu1 and Isu2 in yeast; ISCU
in human) is a major player
among the several proteins involved in the ISC pathway. IscU is the
scaffold protein on which the Fe–S cluster is assembled and
from which the Fe–S cluster is delivered to a receiver apoprotein.
Structures of forms of IscU containing Zn2+ or [2Fe–2S]
ligated have been determined by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography.− However, studies from our laboratory have shown that
IscU in the absence of metal or Fe–S cluster populates two
distinct conformations that interchange on a subsecond time scale,, and interact differentially with
other proteins involved in Fe–S cluster assembly and delivery.,, The S-state is structured, and
the D-state lacks secondary structure but is not unfolded. In addition, N13–P14
and P100–P101, two peptidyl-prolyl peptide bonds that are trans in the S-state, become cis in the
D-state. We report here that the D ⇄
S equilibrium is pH-dependent, with the S-state favored at intermediate
pH values and the D-state favored at high and low pH. NMR studies
demonstrate that the transition at low pH is explained by differences
in the pKa values of two conserved histidine
residues (H10 and H105) in the S- and D-states. The origin of the
transition at high pH remains to be determined. We postulate that
IscU evolved these properties to match changes in proton inventory
in the cluster assembly and transfer reactions.

Materials and Methods
Protein
Production and Purification
Unlabeled IscU
samples were produced and purified as described previously. [U–15N]- and [U–13C, U–15N]-labeled samples of IscU protein
were prepared according to procedures adapted from earlier studies., A colony of BL21 cells transformed with the pTrc 99A plasmid containing
the IscU gene was used to inoculate 5 mL of TB liquid medium containing
100 μg/mL ampicillin. The cells were grown overnight at 37 °C,
and a 100 μL of inoculum was transferred to 250 mL of TB liquid
medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The culture was subsequently
grown for 12 h at 37 °C.

Cells from this 250 mL culture
were used to inoculate 1000 mL of M9 medium containing 100 μg/mL
ampicillin and supplemented with 1 mL of vitamin solution, 1 g of 15NH4Cl, and 4
g unlabeled glucose to produce [U–15N]-IscU. The
culture was induced at an OD600 of ≈1 by adding
IPTG to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Protein production was allowed
to proceed for 12 h, after which cells were harvested and stored at
−80 °C. For production of [U–13C, U–15N]-IscU, unlabeled glucose was substituted with 4 g of [U–13C]-d-glucose. For production of [13C,15N-His; 15N-Tyr]-IscU, the M9 medium contained
100 μg/mL ampicillin, 1 g/L unlabeled-NH4Cl, 4 g/L
unlabeled-glucose, 0.1 g/L [U–13C, U–15N]-histidine, and 0.17 g/L [U–15N]-tyrosine.
In order to further suppress scrambling of the labeled amino acids,
the following amino acids were also added to the medium: 0.5 g/L alanine,
0.4 g/L arginine, 0.4 g/L aspartic acid, 0.05 g/L cystine, 0.4 g/L
glutamine, 0.65 g/L glutamic acid, 0.55 g/L glycine, 0.23 g/L isoleucine,
0.23 g/L leucine, 0.42 g/L lysine hydrochloride, 0.25 g/L methionine,
0.13 g/L phenylalanine, 0.1 g/L proline, 2.1 g/L serine, 0.23 g/L
threonine, and 0.23 g/L valine. Protein purification was conducted
as described previously., The elution buffer
for this step consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, 0.5
mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl. Fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis,
and those appearing homogeneous were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration,
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The isotopic
labeling efficiency was determined by mass spectrometry.

NMR Samples
and pH Titrations
Unless otherwise noted,
the NMR sample buffer contained 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10% D2O, 50 μM DSS, and 50 μM NaN3. The concentration
of [U–15N]-IscU was 1 mM unless specified otherwise.
DSS was used as an internal reference for all titration data. To adjust
the pH value of the solution, 100 mM HCl or NaOH was added gradually
to the IscU samples. The pH readings were recorded both before and
after the NMR measurements. The average values of the two are reported.

NMR Data Collection
NMR data were collected at the
National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison (NMRFAM) on Varian
(Agilent) VNMRS spectrometers equipped with z-gradient cryogenic probes.
DSS was used as an internal reference for all NMR chemical shift measurements.

Assignment of Histidine Signals
IscU has two histidine
residues, H10, which is followed by Y11, and H105, which is followed
by C106. The 1Hε1–13Cε1 peaks of the two histidine residues were assigned
by reference to spectra of [13C,15N-His; 15N-Tyr]-IscU. We collected NMR data at pH 6.0 because we found
that the histidine backbone amide peaks broadened at higher pH values.
The following steps led to the assignment of the 1Hε1–13Cε1 peak from
H10. (i) As expected, a single peak was found in the HNCO spectrum
corresponding to the through-bond connectivity between H10 13C′ and Y11 15N (Figure a). (ii) Two peaks were observed in the CBCA(CO)NH spectrum (Figure b). Both of these peaks share 1H and 15N frequencies with the single peak from the HNCO spectrum,
showing that they originate from 13Cβ–13Cα of H10 and the 15N–1H Y11. (iii) Two peaks were observed in the HBCB(CGCD)HD spectrum,
correlating 13Cβ with the 1Hδ2 of its side chain for each of the two histidine
residues. Only one of these peaks aligns with the 13Cβ peak from the CBCA(CO)NH spectrum, indicating that
this peak correlates 13Cβ of H10 with
the 1Hδ2 of its side chain. By exclusion,
the other peak of the HBCB(CGCD)HD spectrum corresponds to the 1Hδ2 of H105 (Figure c). (iv) The aromatic HCCH-TOCSY experiment showed cross-peaks correlating
the 1Hδ2–13Cδ2 signal assigned to H10 with a 1Hε1–13Cε1 from the same residue, leading to the
assignment of the 1Hε1–13Cε1 peak from H10 (Figure d). The peaks from H105 were assigned by difference. Because the
D-state of IscU dominates at pH 6, we concluded that these peaks arise
from residues in the D-state. The 13C-edited NOESY spectrum
(Figure e) exhibited off-diagonal peaks connecting
the peak assigned to H105 in D-state with a peak assigned to H105
in the S-state. Full cross-assignment of the peaks assigned to H10
and H105 in the S- and D-states was confirmed by a 2D 1H–13C zz-exchange spectrum obtained at pH 9.66
(Figure ).

NMR spectra of [13C,15N-His; 15N-Tyr]-IscU used in assigning NMR signals to
H10 and H105. Data were
collected at pH 6.0 and 25 °C. Under these conditions, the only
peaks assigned to H10 were from the D-state, whereas residue H105
exhibited peaks from both the S- and D-states (H105(S) and H105(D),
respectively). (a) Because IscU contains only one H–Y dipeptide
(that from H10–Y11), the single peak in the 2D HNCO spectrum
is assigned to the connectivity between H10-13C′
and Y11-1HN. (b) The two peaks observed in the
2D CBCA(CO)NH spectrum, which aligned with the signal assigned to
Y11-1HN, provided the 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts of H10. (c)
The 2D HBCB(CGCD)HD spectrum served to extend the assignment from
H10 13Cβ to the side-chain 1Hδ2 of that residue. The other peak was then assigned
to the 13Cβ–1Hδ2 connectivity of H105. (d) The 2D aromatic HCCH-TOCSY spectrum showed
the single-bond 1Hδ2–13Cδ2 and 1Hε1–13Cε1 connectivities from H10 as diagonal
peaks connected by crosspeaks (dashed line). The 1Hε1–13Cε1 diagonal
peak from H105(D) was observed. Although the 1Hδ2–13Cδ2 from H105(D) (seen in panel
c) was missing because of the long mixing time of the pulse sequence,
it was observed in a spectrum accumulated with a shorter mixing time
(data not shown); a peak (labeled with a triangle) was seen corresponding
to the H105(D) 13Cε1–1Hδ2 connectivity. A peak was observed and assigned
to H105(S) 1Hε1–13Cε1 by virtue of exchange crosspeaks (solid line) linking
the signals from this residue in the two conformational states. The
peaks marked by asterisks apparently correspond to aromatic residues
that became partially labeled through scrambling of the histidine
label. (e) The 2D aromatic 13C-edited NOESY spectrum exhibited
chemical exchange peaks linking (dashed line) the diagonal peaks at
8.22 and 8.36 ppm assigned, respectively, to H105(S) 1Hε1 and H105(D) 1Hε1.

peaks labeled H10(S → D) and H10(D → S) link the peaks
assigned to H10(S) and H10(D), and off-diagonal exchange peaks labeled
H105(S → D) and H105(D → S) link the peaks assigned
to H105(S) and H105(D). Note that the peaks from the D-state are more
intense than those from the S-state, indicating that the D-state predominates
at this pH.

Conformational Equilibrium
and Its pH Dependence
The
dissociation of the acid HA to the base A– and a
proton is represented by

In the case of n titratable
groups, the equilibrium can be written as

In the two-state D ⇄ S equilibrium of IscU, the S-state
is favored at intermediate pH and the D-state is favored at high and
low pH. Here, we consider the transition at low pH. If we assume that n protonation–deprotonation steps are involved in
the equilibrium with similar pKa values,
then we havewhere [S]
and [D] are the relative population
of the S- and D-states of the protein, respectively. This can be rearranged
toWe determined [S]/[D] as a function
of pH
from the relative intensities of the Trp76 1Hε1–15Nε1 peaks assigned to the S-
and D-states in 15N-HSQC spectra (Figure ). Fitting these data to eq  yielded
the number n and average pKa value for the titrating groups.

If the exchange of
the titratable group falls under the fast exchange
regime, then the chemical shifts average toThe averaged chemical shift (δ) becomes
a weighted sum of the mole fraction of the acid (χHA) and its chemical shift (δHA) and the mole fraction
of the conjugate base (χA) and its chemical shift
(δA). ThusFitting the chemical shifts and corresponding
pH information to eq  yields the pKa value of the titrating group as well as the chemical
shifts in its protonated and deprotonated states.

Results
pH Dependence
of the IscU D ⇄ S Equilibrium
Previous studies have
shown that the S- and D-states of IscU give
rise to different spectral signatures on the slow chemical shift time
scale., Convenient signals for monitoring the S-
and D-states are those from the side-chain 15Nε1–1Hε1 of the single tryptophan
residue W76. We acquired a series of 2D 15N-HSQC spectra
of [U–15N]-IscU at 25 °C at different pH values
and used the relative intensities of the peaks assigned to the S-
and D-states (Figure ) to determine [S]/([S]
+ [D]). The pH range over which the equilibrium could be studied by
2D 1H–15N NMR was limited to a maximum
of ∼9.6 by the base-catalyzed exchange of the side-chain amide
proton of W76 with protons from solvent water and a minimum of ∼5.4
by protein precipitation at low pH. The results of this analysis (Figure a) showed that IscU transitions from the S-state
to the D-state as the pH is lowered. A plot of log([S]/[ D]) vs pH
(Figure b) yielded a straight line with a
fitted slope of 0.50 and an intercept of 6.5. This result indicates
that the D ⇄ S equilibrium is driven by the binding/release
of two protons and suggests that the residues involved might be histidines.
IscU contains two conserved histidines, H10 and H105.

Determination of the pKa Values
of the Histidine Residues of IscU
We collected 1H–13C HMQC spectra of [13C,15N-His; 15N-Tyr]-IscU at 25 °C as a function of pH,
which enabled us to track the positions of the 1Hε1–13Cε1 crosspeaks from H10 and
H105 (Figure ). The 1H chemical
shifts of these crosspeaks are plotted as a function of pH in Figure a, and the 13C chemical shifts are plotted
in Figure b. The histidine peaks assigned
to the D-state yielded titration curves with fitted pKa values of 7.01 (from 1H shifts) and 6.99
(from 13C shifts) for H10(D) and 6.32 (from 1H shifts) and 6.26 (from 13C shifts) for H105(D) (Table ). Complete titration curves could not be determined
for the histidine peaks assigned to the S-state because the signals
lost intensity as the pH was lowered as a consequence of S →
D conversion and could not be followed below pH 6. Nevertheless, the
upper bounds of the pKa values could be
estimated for H10(S) as 5.6 from the pH dependence of its 1Hε1 signal and for H105(S) as 5.5 from the pH dependence
of its 1Hε1 signal and 5.3 from the pH
dependence of its 13Cε1 signal. The peak
assigned to 13Cε1 of H10(S) (Figure b) has an anomalous chemical shift and exhibited
a small pH dependent shift with a midpoint of pH 7.9. This small shift
in the opposite direction to that expected for titration of H10(S)
itself must represent a spectroscopic shift resulting from protonation/deprotonation
of some other group.

We confirmed the results for the D-state by carrying out the titration
at 45 °C, where the D-state predominates (spectra not shown).
The pKa values determined for H10(D) and
H105(D) from the pH dependence of His 1Hε1–13Cε1 signals in 1H–13C HMQC spectra of [U–13C]-IscU
were very similar to those obtained at 25 °C (Table ).

We determined pH dependence of the D ⇄

(Figure ). In contrast to the data from the 15Nε1–1Hε1 signal of W76 (Figure a), a S → D
shift was observed at high pH.

pH. [S]/([S] + [D]) was obtained from the average intensities of the
peaks from H10(D) and H105(D) and H10(S) and H105(S).

Discussion
Previous studies have
shown that IscU exists in equilibrium between
two different conformational states, a more structured state (S) and
a more dynamic state (D) that lacks secondary structure but is not unfolded in that it stabilizes two cis peptidyl-prolyl peptide bonds that are trans in the S-state. Results presented here
show that the D ⇄ S equilibrium is pH-dependent, with the S-state
predominant around pH 7 and the D-state stabilized at high and low
pH (Figure ). The high pH transition observed
in 1H–13C data was missed in the 1H–15N NMR data (Figures  and a). This can be explained if
the rate of exchange of the W76 1Hε1 with
solvent is much higher in the D-state than in the S-state, as would
result from higher solvent accessibility of W76 in the D-state. From
the pH dependence of the high pH limb, we infer that the S →
D transition involves a decrease in the proton affinity of one or
more cysteine residues. Confirmation of this will require selective
labeling of the cysteine residues. The plot of log([S]/[D]) vs pH
(Figure b) indicated the involvement of two
protonation/deprotonation steps in the lower limb. By following the
pH dependence of chemical shifts of signals assigned to the two conserved
histidine residues (H10 and H105) in the S- and D-states, we determined
their pKa values. In the D-state, H10
and H105 titrate with relatively normal pKa values of 7.0 and 6.5, respectively (Table ). However, in the S-state, both histidine side chains have abnormally
low pKa values. Although full titration
curves could not be determined accurately for H10 and H105 in the
S-state, we estimated the upper limits for their pKa values as 5.3 and 5.6, respectively, from the average
of their fitted values in Table . The minimum
change in pKa value resulting from the
S → D transition was found to be 1.7 pH units (7.0–5.3)
for H10 and 1.1 pH units (6.5–5.4) for H105. This indicates
that the S → D transition increases the proton affinity at
H10 by a factor of ≥50 and at H105 by a factor of ≥13.
In principle, the pH at which log ([S]/[D]) = 0 (6.5 from Figure b) should be the mean of the average pKa values for the two residues (H10 and H105) in their
S- and D-states: (7.0 + 5.3)/2 + (6.5 + 5.4)/2 = 6.1 from Table . The agreement, although not ideal, is likely within
experimental error given the neglect of the high pH limb in analysis
of the pH dependence of S ⇄ D. Because of peak overlap, we
were unable to obtain a sufficient number of points at high pH to
analyze both the high and low pH limbs from the 1H–13C peak intensities (Figure ).

H105 appears to be conserved absolutely in IscU from all organisms,
and H10 is conserved absolutely in all organism classes with the exception
of some α-proteobacteria. H10 in
the S-state exhibits anomalous chemical shifts and titration behavior.
The H10(S) 13Cε1 peak exhibits a pHmid at ∼8.2 that may correspond to the protonation/deprotonation
step(s) responsible for the S → D conversion at high pH. When
H10(S) accepts a proton at low pH, as inferred from the chemical shift
of the H10(S) 1Hε1 peak, the H10(S) 13Cε1 peak shifts in a direction opposite
to normal. The PACSY database, which
enables searches of structures that correspond to NMR chemical shifts,
yielded a match for the unusual IscU H10(S) 13Cε1 chemical shift of 137 ppm at pH 8.5. The match was to H111 of an
ATPase, a histidine residue largely buried in a hydrophobic cavity
near a lysine residue (BMRB 5576; PDB ID: 1mo8). Although
the position of H10 was not defined in the NMR structure of the S-state
of IscU (PDB ID: 2l4x), the imidazole ring of residues homologous
to H10 were found buried adjacent to a short α-helix in the
X-ray structures of [2Fe–2S]-IscU (PDB ID: 2z7e) and the IscU–IscS complex (PDB ID: 3lvl) and the NMR structure of Zn-bound SufU (PDB ID: 2azh).

What may explain the evolutionary conservation of
these two residues
of IscU that have very different chemical properties in the two conformational
states? IscU, as the scaffold protein for Fe–S cluster assembly
and delivery, is a hub protein that interacts with several different
partner proteins in this process. Results from our laboratory have
shown that the cysteine desulfurase (IscS) and the Hsp70-type chaperone in its ADP-bound state (HscA:ADP) each bind preferentially to the D-state of IscU,
whereas the iron-delivery protein (IscX) and the Hsp40-type cochaperone (HscB), each bind
preferentially to the S-state of IscU. Thus, in the course of Fe–S
cluster biosynthesis, IscU may potentially interconvert between its
D- and S-states six times: (S) predominant state of free IscU (1)
→ (D) IscU–IscS (first sulfur transfer) (2) →
(S) IscU–IscX (first iron transfer) (3) → (D) IscU–IscS
(second sulfur transfer) (4) → (S) IscU–IscX (second
iron transfer and cluster assembly) followed by formation of IscU[2Fe–2S]–HscB
(5) → (D) IscU–HscA(ADP) (6) → (S) free IscU.

Many of the processes taking place in Fe–S cluster assembly
and delivery involve protonation and deprotonation steps. Thus, it
is tempting to speculate how these might be coupled to the changes
in proton affinity of IscU accompanying S ⇄ D interconversion.
The coupling could be direct or through chains of water molecules.
Because the binding of metal ions, such as Zn2+ or Fe2+, has been shown to shift the S ⇄ D equilibrium completely
to the S-state, the D-state appears to
have a low affinity for metals. NMR studies have shown that the cysteine
desulfurase, IscS, binds preferentially to the D-state of IscU. This interaction minimizes metal binding to IscU
and thus ensures that its cysteine residues are unligated and available
to pick up the sulfur atom generated by IscS through its catalysis
of the conversion of l-cysteine to l-alanine. Protonation
of the metal ligand H105 would serve to inhibit metal binding. The
increased proton affinity of IscU could assist in the deprotonation
of the cysteine Sγ of IscU that picks up sulfur from
IscS.

The S-state favored by interaction with IscX:Fe2+ puts IscU into the conformation that
binds metal
ions. The two protons released upon the D → S conversion may
serve to protonate the IscX side chains that ligate Fe2+ and catalyze transfer of the iron ion to IscU. The S-state is further
stabilized upon formation of the Fe–S cluster. Once deprotonated,
H105 is in the state to bind one of the iron atoms of the cluster,
as observed in the X-ray structure of [2Fe–2S]-IscU.

Fe–S cluster transfer first involves
formation of the HscB–IscU[2Fe–2S]–HscA(ATP)
complex. We have postulated that the attack of one, or probably two,
cysteine side chains of the acceptor protein on the iron atoms of
the cluster bound to IscU serves to trigger the cascade of reactions
leading to cluster transfer. The attack
of two cysteine −SH groups would liberate two protons; these
could be transferred to the displaced side chains of IscU, most likely
those of H105 and one of the cysteines. Protonation of H105 would
favor S → D conversion, and the ensuing conformational change
could lead to activation of the ATPase, converting HscA:ATP to HscA:ADP.
ATP hydrolysis liberates a proton that could be picked up by H10.
HscA:ADP binds preferentially to the D-sate of IscU, and this interaction would ensure complete release of the
cluster to the acceptor protein. Finally, exchange of bound ADP with
ATP regenerates HscA:ATP, which releases IscU and allows it to regain
its predominant S-state.

Our results clearly show that the histidine
residues of IscU have
very different proton affinities in its D- and S-states. As noted
above, additional experiments will be required to determine the origin
of the S → D shift at high pH. If, as suspected, the shift
arises from decreased proton affinity of cysteine residue(s), then
this would point to higher cysteine reactivity in the D-state than
that in the S-state.
