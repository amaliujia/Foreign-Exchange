Photosynthesis
is the biological
process by which light energy is converted to chemical energy through
the formation of sugars from CO2. Plants and cyanobacteria
utilize water, which is present in abundance on earth, as the ultimate
electron donor to reduce CO2. Oxidation of water liberates
molecular oxygen, which is the source of the earth’s oxygenic
atmosphere. Thus, oxygenic photosynthesis sustains life on earth as
both an energy source and an oxygen source.

The water oxidation
reactions take place in photosystem II (PSII)
protein complexes embedded in thylakoid membranes.− The catalytic site of water oxidation is the water oxidizing center
(WOC), which consists of a Mn4CaO5 cluster and
surrounding amino acid ligands (six carboxylate groups and one imidazole
group belonging to the D1 and CP43 subunits).− Water oxidation proceeds through
a cycle of five intermediates designated Sn states (n = 0–4),− with a larger value of n implying a higher oxidation
state of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. Among them, the
S1 state is the most stable in the dark, and the Sn state (n = 0–3)
advances to the next Sn+1 state upon one-electron
abstraction by a chlorophyll cation, P680+, which is produced
by light-induced charge separation, via the redox-active tyrosine
YZ. The S4 state is a transient state that immediately
relaxes to the S0 state releasing O2.

Chloride has long been known to be an indispensable cofactor for
water oxidation.− Upon Cl– depletion, S-state transitions beyond
the S2 state are blocked and O2 evolution is
inhibited.− O2 evolution can still occur when Cl– is replaced by monovalent anions such as Br–, NO3–, and I–,, but at a lower rate. Upon these substitutions for Cl–, the S3 → S0 transition is mainly retarded., It has been suggested that two types of Cl– with
high and low affinities are involved in water oxidation.− Indeed, X-ray crystallographic studies of PSII from the thermophilic
cyanobacteria Thermosynechococcus elongatus and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus showed two binding sites for
Br– or I– near the Mn4CaO5 cluster upon replacement of Cl–., The recent high-resolution (1.9 Å)
X-ray structure of PSII from T. vulcanus confirmed
that one Cl– ion is indeed bound to each of these
sites. One of these Cl– ions (Cl-1) is located 6.6 Å from Mn4 and is surrounded by
the side chains of D2-K317 and D1-N181, the backbone NH group of D1-E333,
and two water molecules, while the other Cl– (Cl-2)
is located 7.4 Å from Mn2 and surrounded by the backbone NH groups
of CP43-E354, D1-N338, and D1-F339 and two water molecules (Figure ). However, another X-ray study (at 2.9 Å resolution)
of T. elongatus PSII showed only one Cl– at the Cl-1 site, and furthermore, PSII
treated with the herbicide terbutryn contained in addition to the
Cl-1 site (designated Cl-1A), a second Cl–-binding
site (Cl-1B) near Cl-1A. Thus, there
are possibilities that the Cl–-binding sites are
dependent on PSII preparations or even that Cl– changes
its binding site during the S-state cycle.

Structure
around the Mn4CaO5 cluster and
two Cl– ions deduced from the X-ray crystal structure
of photosystem II at 1.9 Å resolution (Protein Data Bank entry 3ARC). Amino acid side chains, backbone amides, and water
molecules, which directly interact with the Mn cluster and Cl ions
or are involved in a hydrogen bond network, are shown.

Because Cl-1 and Cl-2 interact with the backbone
amides of ligands
to the Mn4CaO5 cluster, at D1-E333 and D1-H332
for Cl-1 and at CP43-E354 for Cl-2, it has been proposed that Cl– functions to maintain the structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. In addition,
because Cl-1 is located close to the entrance of a possible proton
channel, Cl-1 has been proposed to have a function of forming a proton
pathway from the Mn4CaO5 cluster to the lumen.,, Recent molecular dynamics and
Monte Carlo simulations have proposed that one role for Cl– might be to prevent the formation of a salt bridge between D2-K317
and D1-D61 that could suppress proton transfer. Also, kinetic measurements of Ca2+/Sr2+- and Cl–/I–-exchanged PSII showed
significant retardation of the S3YZ• → (S3YZ•)′
→ S0 kinetics in PSII containing bound Sr2+ and I–, suggesting that the Ca2+ and
Cl– sites are connected though a hydrogen bond network
that acts as a channel for proton release. It was further proposed that proton transfer is promoted by the
movement of Cl– between the Cl-1A and Cl-1B sites. However, there is still a lack of evidence for
the functional roles of Cl– at each of the binding
sites. Light-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference
spectroscopy is a powerful method for examining the detailed molecular
structures and reactions of the WOC during water oxidation.− Structural information about the Mn cluster, amino acid side chains,− protein main chains, and water molecules, coupled to the S-state transitions has been obtained. Hasegawa et
al. previously detected S2-minus-S1 (hereafter designated S2/S1) FTIR difference spectra of PSII preparations in which Cl– is replaced with various monovalent anions. Substitution with Br–, I–, and NO3–, which supported O2 evolution, restored the overall features
of the spectrum, whereas Cl– depletion and replacement
with F– and acetate, which suppressed O2 evolution, induced significant structural changes in the carboxylate
and amide regions. They further identified the NO stretching bands
of NO3– in the S2/S1 spectrum of Cl–/NO3–-replaced PSII using isotope-labeled NO3– (15NO3– or N16O3–) and discussed the structure of
NO3– at the Cl– site., However, in light of the information from the recent X-ray structures
that suggested two Cl– sites probably exist around
the Mn4CaO5 cluster,,,, the questions
of which Cl– site the NO3– ion binds and whether both of them have been detected by FTIR arise.
These questions are essential for the investigation of the role of
Cl– in the water oxidation mechanism using NO3– substitution.

In this study, we
have used light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy
to investigate the functional role of Cl– bound
to the Cl-1 site through analysis of mutant PSII complexes isolated
from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803
in which D2-K317, which directly interacts with Cl-1, is replaced
with Arg. In addition, we monitored the vibrations of NO3–, which was substituted for Cl–, and examined the effect of the D2-K317R mutation to study the interaction
of NO3– in the Cl-1 site. The obtained
data revealed that the strong structural coupling exists between the
Cl-1 site and the Mn4CaO5 cluster and support
a model in which D2-K317 and Cl-1 are involved in a proton transfer
pathway in the S3 → S0 transition.

Materials
and Methods
Construction of Mutants
The D2-K317R mutant and WT
control strain were constructed according to the method of Tang et
al. except that the recipient strain
Tol145/CP47-His, obtained by transforming strain Tol145 with genomic DNA from strain PSII-His, also encoded a C-terminal His-tagged derivative
of CP47. Plasmid pDC074 was used as the parental vector for site-directed
mutagenesis. Mutations were introduced
into the plasmid by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
so that the AAA codon specifying D2-K317 was replaced with the AGA
codon (to make D2-K317R). A silent mutation was also introduced at
F311 (TTT to TTC) to create an EcoRI site to allow
detection of mutants. A WT control strain was generated using the
pDC074 plasmid. The genotypes of the cyanobacterial strains were confirmed
by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing.

Cell Growth and Isolation
of His-Tagged PSII Oxygen-Evolving
Complexes
Cells were maintained on BG-11 plates containing
5 mM glucose, 25 mg/L kanamycin, 15 mg/L erythromycin, and 10 μM
DCMU. Oxygen-evolving His-tagged PSII
complexes were isolated from 30 L cultures using the procedure described
by Service et al. The presence of the
engineered mutations in the final culture was verified by PCR and
DNA sequencing. The rates of light-saturated oxygen evolution determined
in the presence of 50 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.5), 500 mM sucrose, 30 mM
CaCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, and electron acceptors 1
mM potassium ferricyanide and 0.1 mM 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone
(DCBQ) were in the range of 2000–2900 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h–1 for both the
WT and mutant complexes, in line with previous values obtained with
His-tagged and untagged WT PSII complexes., In particular, this O2 evolution activity of WT is similar
to that reported by Pokhrel et al., although
higher values have been reported by Debus and colleagues. It should be noted that our assay buffer contains
sufficient calcium (30 mM) to maintain O2 evolution. Even
in the absence of calcium in the buffer, the O2 evolution
activity of the PSII core complexes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is decreased only by 25–45%. Growth experiments were performed by measuring the OD730 of liquid BG-11 cultures inoculated to an initial cell
density with an OD730 of 0.01. Four 30 mL cultures were
grown for each strain in Corning cell culture flasks (25 cm2, canted neck, vente) at 29 °C at a constant irradiance of 40
μE m–2 s–1 fluorescent white
light and at 100 rpm. Chloride depletion was performed by replacing
all chloride salts in the medium with their nitrate equivalents.

For examination of the Cl– concentration dependence
of the O2 evolution activity, O2 evolution of
the PSII core complexes was measured in an assay buffer containing
500 mM sucrose, 120 mM MES-NaOH (pH 6.5), 30 mM Ca(OH)2, and 10 mM Mg(OH)2 together with 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20,
or 40 mM NaCl, in the presence of 0.5 mM DCBQ as an electron acceptor.
The lowest Cl– concentration was 0.6 mM because
of the Cl– contamination from the original buffer
[50 mM Mes-NaOH (pH 6.0), 1.2 M betaine, 20 mM CaCl2, 10
mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 100 mM histidine hydrochloride,
and 0.04% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside
(DM)], in which the PSII core complexes were suspended.

FTIR Measurements
The PSII complexes were suspended
in a 10 mM Mes-NaOH (pH 6.0) buffer containing 5 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 40 mM sucrose, and 0.06% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM) and concentrated to ∼2.25 mg of Chl/mL
using Microcon-100 (Amicon). In the experiments that aimed to study
the effect of NO3– replacement for Cl–, the core complexes were first treated with NO3– in a 20 mM Mes-NaOH buffer (pH 6.0) containing
100 mM NaNO3, 5 mM Ca(OH)2, 40 mM sucrose, and
0.06% DM. The sample was then washed with a buffer with the same content
except for 10 mM NaNO3 and was concentrated to ∼2.5
mg of Chl/mL. An aliquot of the sample suspension (10 μL) in
the buffer with Cl– or NO3– was mixed with 1 μL of 100 mM potassium ferricyanide and dried
on a CaF2 plate (25 mm × 25 mm) under N2 gas in an oval shape (6 mm × 9 mm). The sample was hydrated
by placing 2 μL of a 40% (v/v) glycerol/water solution in a
sealed IR cell without touching the sample. For solution measurements, the dried sample was resuspended with
0.8 μL of water and sandwiched with another CaF2 plate
with a circular groove (10 mm inner diameter, 1 mm width) as described
previously. The sample temperature was
kept at 10 °C by circulating cold water through a copper holder.

Flash-induced FTIR difference spectra were measured on a Bruker
IFS-66/S spectrophotometer equipped with an MCT detector (InfraRed
D316/8) at 4 cm–1 resolution. Flash illumination was performed by a Q-switched Nd:YAG
laser (Quanta-Ray GCR-130, 532 nm, ∼7 ns full width at half-maximum)
with a power of ∼7 mJ cm–1 pulse–1 at the sample point. For the measurements of S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra, the sample was first illuminated
by two preflashes (1 s interval) followed by dark adaptation for 10
min. A single-beam spectrum (100 scans, 50 s scan) was recorded twice
before illumination of a single flash and once after the illumination,
and then the sample was adapted to the dark for 10 min. This process
of measurement and dark adaptation was repeated 48 and 24 times for
WT and D2-K317R, respectively, and the spectra were averaged to calculate
the S2/S1 and dark/dark (noise level) spectra
(the diagram of the measurement procedure is shown in Figure S1 of
the ). Spectra were
measured using two different samples to obtain final average data.

A similar measurement scheme was used for the PSII sample treated
with NO3–. In this case, the dark incubation
time was 5 min and single-beam spectra were recorded by 20 s scans
reflecting faster S2 relaxation with NO3– (τ ∼ 200 and 100 s with Cl– and NO3–, respectively, under our measurement
conditions). The cycle was repeated 168 times, and the data were averaged
to calculate S2/S1 difference spectra.

For the measurements of FTIR difference spectra of the S-state
cycle, after two preflashes followed by dark adaptation for 15 min,
four flashes were applied with 10 s intervals. Single-beam spectra
(20 scans, 10 s scan) were measured before, between, and after the
flashes. The sample was then adapted to the dark for 15 min; this
entire cycle was repeated 17 or 18 times, and the data were averaged
to calculate the difference spectra upon first, second, third, and
fourth flash illumination (the details of the measurement procedure
are shown in the diagram in Figure S1 of the ).

When double difference spectra were calculated,
factors for subtraction
were determined to minimize the least-squares of the double difference
between 1470 and 1270 cm–1 representing the symmetric
COO– region. The spectral analysis was performed
using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc.).

Results
The D2-K317R
mutant and its WT control strain were constructed
in the phycocyanin-deficient “olive” strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which contains approximately
twice as much PSII as the widely used glucose-tolerant strain. Both D2-K317R and the WT control strain also
expressed a C-terminal His-tagged derivative of CP47 to allow isolation
of His-tagged PSII complexes. The D2-K317R mutant retained the ability
to grow photoautotrophically at rates similar to that of the WT control
in both liquid BG-11 medium and BG-11 medium that had been depleted
of chloride (Figure S2 of the ). Oxygen evolution in young cultures grown mixotrophically in the
presence of 5 mM glucose to a concentratioon of 1–2 μg
of chlorophyll/mL was also experimentally indistinguishable from that
of the WT control strain, with both giving light-saturated rates of
530–600 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h–1 in the presence of the electron acceptors
0.1 mM DCBQ and 1 mM potassium ferricyanide. These data therefore
suggest that the conservative replacement of D2-K317 with Arg does
not have drastic effects on PSII activity in vivo under the experimental conditions used.

Figure a shows an S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum
in the typical protein region (1800–1200
cm–1) of a hydrated film of His-tagged oxygen-evolving
PSII core complexes isolated from the WT control strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The spectral features were very
similar to those reported previously for PSII complexes from the same
species− as well as from T. elongatus., Bands at 1450–1300 cm–1 have been assigned
to the symmetric COO– stretching vibrations of carboxylate
residues, while asymmetric COO– bands appear at
1600–1500 cm–1., The strong features in these regions indicate that the several carboxylate
groups are coupled to the structural changes in the S1 →
S2 transition. The features in the 1700–1600 cm–1 region are mainly attributed to the amide I bands
(C=O stretches of backbone amides), representing the conformational
changes of proteins around the WOC., Amide II bands
(NH bends and CN stretches of backbone amides) that are coupled to
amide I bands appear around 1550 cm–1, superimposing
with the asymmetric COO– bands., Recently, it was shown that the CN/NH2 vibrations of
a guanidinium group most probably from CP43-Arg357 are present at
1700–1600 cm–1. The negative band at 1748 cm–1 has been assigned
to the C=O stretching vibration(s) of a COOH group(s) in the
hydrogen bond network around the Mn4CaO5 cluster.

Flash-induced S2/S1 FTIR difference
spectra
in the 1800–1200 cm–1 region of moderately
hydrated films of the PSII complexes from WT (a) and the D2-K317R
mutant (b) of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and (c)
their double difference spectrum (a minus b).

Figure b shows the S2/S1 difference spectrum of a hydrated film of PSII from the D2-K317R
mutant. The spectral features are clearly different from those of
the WT spectrum, although the signal intensities were basically identical,
consistent with the similar O2 evolution activities. In
the symmetric COO– stretching region (1450–1300
cm–1), the most prominent negative band at 1398
cm–1 is upshifted to 1403 cm–1 with a sharper bandwidth, while the positive and negative peaks
at 1364 and 1417 cm–1, respectively, are slightly
upshifted to 1367 and 1419 cm–1, respectively, with
weakened intensities. In the asymmetric COO–/amide
II region (1600–1500 cm–1), the intensities
of positive peak at 1587 cm–1 and the negative peaks
at 1543 and 1524 cm–1 were significantly weakened
in the K317R mutant. In the amide I region (1700–1600 cm–1), the band pattern significantly changed: a new peak
appeared at 1619 cm–1, and the positive peaks at
1652 and 1670 cm–1 became smaller and stronger,
respectively. The CN/NH2 bands of Arg, which was introduced
by the K317R mutation, could be involved in this region. The negative
band at 1748 cm–1 due to a COOH group(s) was changed
to a positive feature with peaks at 1748 and 1742 cm–1. The negative peak at 1705 cm–1 could be the signal
of YD, or YZ in some inactive centers.

These spectral differences
are better expressed in the WT-minus-K317R
double difference spectrum (Figure c). As
expected, prominent features are observed in the symmetric COO– regions with positive peaks at 1443, 1407, and 1362
cm–1 and negative peaks at 1417 and 1394 cm–1. Also, large features were observed in the amide
I and amide II/asymmetric COO– regions. Positive
peaks at 1703, 1653, 1635, 1588, 1552, 1535, and 1514 cm–1 and negative peaks at 1690, 1677, 1618, 1545, and 1525 cm–1 were observed. The COOH band was detected as a negative peak at
1749 cm–1.

Figure  (red line) shows the S2/S1 FTIR difference
spectra of NO3–-treated core complexes
of WT (a) and D2-K317R (b) in comparison
with the corresponding spectra of untreated PSII (black lines; identical
to parts a and b of Figure , respectively).
The overall features were very similar between the untreated and NO3–-treated PSII in both WT and K317R, but
some differences were also observed. (1) A negative dip at 1355–1353
cm–1 almost disappeared by the overlap of the positive
intensity in this region. (2) In the amide II region, the intensities
of the negative bands at 1562, 1543, and 1524 cm–1 in WT and 1568, 1537, and 1520 cm–1 in K317R became
weaker. (3) The intensities of the peaks in the amide I region (1700–1600
cm–1) were generally weakened. (4) In WT, the negative
peak at 1748 cm–1 was changed to a positive peak
at 1743 cm–1, whereas in D2-K317R, no prominent
change was observed at this position.

Flash-induced S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra
of NO3–-treated PSII complexes (red lines)
from WT (a) and D2-K317R (b), and (c) their double difference spectrum
(a minus b) in comparison with the corresponding spectra of untreated
PSII (black lines, identical to Figure ).

In Figure c, a WT-minus-K317R double difference
spectrum of the NO3–-treated PSII (red
line) is compared with that of the untreated PSII (black line, identical
to Figure c). The spectral features in the
symmetric COO– region (1450–1300 cm–1) were very similar, reflecting similar structural changes in the
carboxylate groups even after NO3– treatment.
In contrast, the band intensities were much smaller in the amide I
and II regions, although the overall features and band positions were
similar. The latter observation, however, should be carefully interpreted
because the amide I and II bands of protein main chains are generally
sensitive to subtle differences in sample conditions.

It has
previously been shown that the asymmetric NO stretching
vibrations of NO3– bound near the Mn4CaO5 cluster exhibit bands only in the 1450–1250
cm–1 region., Thus, the NO3–-induced spectral changes near 1350 cm–1 mentioned above should involve the bands of NO3–. To identify the NO3– bands in the
S2/S1 difference spectra and examine the effect
of the D2-K317R mutation on the NO3– bands,
the S2/S1 spectra of PSII treated with isotope-labeled 15NO3– were measured for WT and
D2-K317R. Figure  compares the spectra in
the NO3– region of the 15NO3–-treated and 14NO3– (natural abundance)-treated PSII core complexes
(red and black lines, respectively) of WT (a) and K317R (b). Small
but clear differences were observed around 1350 cm–1.

S2/S1 FTIR difference spectra in the 1500–1200
cm–1 region of the 15NO3–-treated PSII complexes (red lines) from WT (a) and
D2-K317R (b) in comparison with those of 14NO3–-treated PSII (black lines, Figure ).

Isotope-edited NO3– bands without
protein contributions were obtained in the 14NO3–-minus-15NO3– double difference spectra (Figure ). The
spectrum of WT (Figure a) showed a large positive
peak at 1368 cm–1 concomitant with a negative peak
at 1417 cm–1, a broad negative signal at ∼1320
cm–1, and a positive signal at 1279 cm–1. These features were similar to the previously reported 14NO3–-minus-15NO3– double difference spectra of the PSII membranes and PSII core complexes from spinach, in which bands were observed at 1406, 1369, 1323,
and 1288 cm–1 and at 1415, 1369, 1319, and 1284
cm–1, respectively.

14NO3–-minus-15NO3– double difference
spectra of the
S2/S1 difference spectra of the NO3–-treated PSII complexes from WT (a) and D2-K317R
(b) and double difference spectra of the dark-minus-dark spectra of
WT (c) and D2-K317R (d) representing noise levels.

Similar band features were also observed at 1430,
1265, 1324, and
1285 cm–1 in the 14NO3–-minus-15NO3– double difference spectrum of D2-K317R (Figure b). The signal intensities were also similar to those of WT
(Figure a), indicating that the Cl– ion(s) at the same site(s) as WT was replaced with NO3– in D2-K317R. The random noise levels of these
spectra are shown in the corresponding double difference spectra of
the dark-minus-dark spectra of WT (Figure c) and D2-K317R (Figure d). It is clear that
the negative peak at 1417 cm–1 in WT is upshifted
to 1430 cm–1 in D2-K317R. The strongest peak at
1368 cm–1 and the positive peak at 1279 cm–1 seem to be slightly downshifted and upshifted to 1365 and 1285 cm–1, respectively, by the D2-K317R mutation. The broad
feature at ∼1320 cm–1 in WT was changed to
a relatively sharp peak at 1324 cm–1 in K317R.

Figure  shows the FTIR difference spectra
of the S-state cycle obtained by applying four flashes on the hydrated
films of WT (black lines) and D2-K317R (red line). The spectral features
of WT were very similar to those reported previously.− In particular, the spectral intensities of the individual S-state
transitions were comparable to those by Debus and colleagues., The effects of the mutation on the first-flash spectrum were similar
to those of the S2/S1 spectrum in Figure , e.g., slight upshifts of the peaks at 1416, 1398,
and 1364 cm–1 to 1418, 1402, and 1366 cm–1, respectively, in the symmetric COO– region and
decreases in intensities of the 1588, 1543, and 1523 cm–1 peaks in the asymmetric COO–/amide II region.
The change of the negative COOH band at 1747 cm–1 to a positive band at 1744 cm–1 was also similar
to Figure . However, some differences were
detected especially in the amide I region; the intensity increases
at 1619 and 1674 cm–1 in Figure  were not detected in Figure a. This
could be due to subtle changes in the sample conditions, such as the
extent of hydration, that affect the intensities of the amide I bands.

Flash-induced
FTIR difference spectra of the S-state cycle in moderately
hydrated films of PSII complexes from WT (black lines) and D2-K317R
(red lines): (a) first flash, (b) second flash, (c) third flash, and
(d) fourth flash.

The features of the second-flash
spectra, which mostly represent
the S2 → S3 transition, were similar
between WT and D2-K317R especially in the symmetric COO– region (1450–1300 cm–1) except for small
frequency shifts (from 1445 to 1443 cm–1 and from
1395 to 1399 cm–1, respectively) (Figure b). However, the features of the asymmetric COO–/amide II region at 1600–1500 cm–1 were rather different, e.g., the appearance of a negative peak at
1543 cm–1 and the decrease and increase in the intensity
of the 1569 and 1506 cm–1 bands, respectively. These
changes following the second flash in the D2-K317R mutant were similar
to those in FTIR spectra of several mutants of carboxylate residues
around the Mn4CaO5 cluster detected by Service
et al.

It is notable that the overall
spectral intensities significantly
decreased and band features almost disappeared by mutation at the
third- and fourth-flash spectra. This can be ascribed to a significant
decrease in the efficiency of the S3 → S0 transition of the D2-K317R core complexes because of partial dehydration
of the PSII protein in the moderately hydrated film used for the experiments.

To confirm this idea, an FTIR spectrum of the S-state cycle was
measured using a solution sample of D2-K317R (Figure , red line). In the third-flash spectrum (Figure c, red line), peaks at 1702, 1609, 1544, 1513, 1410,
1384, and 1346 cm–1 corresponding to the peaks at
1699, 1608, 1543, 1508, 1414, 1384, and 1345 cm–1, respectively, in the third-flash spectrum of WT (Figure c, black line) were clearly shown. Also, in the
fourth-flash spectrum (Figure d, red line),
peaks at 1581, 1442, 1420, 1398, and 1255 cm–1 corresponding
to the peaks at 1586, 1444, 1419, 1396, and 1253 cm–1, respectively, in the fourth-flash spectrum of WT (Figure d, black line) were observed. These observations
indicate that the S3 → S0 transition
as well as the S0 → S1 transition is
not blocked in the D2-K317R mutant in solution. The spectral similarities
suggest that there are no drastic structural changes in the S3 → S0 and S0 → S1 transitions between D2-K317R and WT. Furthermore, it is notable
that the negative COOH band at 1748 cm–1, which
was observed in the S2/S1 spectrum of WT but
was absent in the spectrum of the hydrated film of K317R (Figure a, b), appeared in the first-flash spectrum of the
solution sample of this mutant (Figure a,
red line). Another characteristic of the solution spectra is stronger
features in the amide I region (1700–1600 cm–1), indicative of more flexible movements of the protein main chains
around the Mn4CaO5 cluster in solution than
in a hydrated film.

Discussion
The side chain of D2-K317
interacts with one of the two Cl– ions, Cl-1, in
the high-resolution (1.9 Å) X-ray
structure of PSII. Cl-1 is linked with
the Mn4CaO5 cluster through the backbone NH
group of D1-E333, a bridging ligand to Mn2 and Mn4, and also through
a hydrogen bond network that includes water molecules and D1-D61 (Figure ). These water molecules in the network involve
W1 and W2, which are the direct ligands to Mn4 and candidates for
substrate water. Thus, it is expected that the impact of the mutation
of D2-K317 provides insight into the structural coupling of Cl-1 with
the Mn4CaO5 cluster and its role in the water
oxidation reaction.

The D2-K317R mutant retained O2 evolution activity [2000–2900
μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h–1] as well as basic features of the S2/S1 FTIR difference spectrum (Figure ), suggesting that no serious alterations took place in the structure
of the Mn4CaO5 cluster. These observations also
provide evidence that Cl– is basically retained
in the WOC of the D2-K317R mutant, because Cl– depletion
inhibits O2 evolution,− and the previous FTIR
spectrum of Cl–-depleted PSII showed a much weaker
intensity in the symmetric COO– band at ∼1400
cm–1. Although the
spectra are broadly similar, the D2-K317R mutation did, however, induce
some clear differences in the S2/S1 FTIR spectrum
in the symmetric COO– stretching (1450–1300
cm–1), asymmetric COO– stretching/amide
II (1600–1500 cm–1), amide I (1700–1600
cm–1), and COOH (1750–1700 cm–1) regions (Figure ). This indicates that
D2-K317 is structurally coupled with the Mn4CaO5 cluster, even though it is ∼7 Å from the nearest Mn
ion (Mn4), and that the mutation perturbs the COO–/COOH groups and protein conformations that undergo structural changes
upon the S1 → S2 transition.

The
WT-minus-K317R double difference spectrum (Figure c) showed peaks at 1443, 1417, and 1407, 1394, and
1362 cm–1 in the symmetric COO– stretching region. The primary candidates for the carboxylate groups
responsible for these peaks are those of D1-E333 and D1-D61 because
of the putative interactions with D2-K317 through Cl-1 and/or water
molecules as mentioned above. Previous FTIR measurements of the D1-D61A
mutant, however, did not show drastic
changes in the symmetric COO– region of the S2/S1 difference spectrum. The peak at 1394 cm–1 agrees with that of CP43-E354 in the S1 state, which has been identified using the CP43-E354Q mutant., However, the corresponding band in the S2 state at 1431
cm–1 in the previous study, was not observed in this study. The COO– signal
as a counterpart of the negative COOH peak at 1749 cm–1 (see below) should appear in this COO– region.
However, the spectrum of NO3–-treated
PSII, which did not show this negative COOH signal, also provided
similar double difference signals at 1442, 1416, 1405, 1392, and 1360
cm–1 in the COO– region (Figure c), indicating the contribution of this deprotonation
reaction to the COO– signals is not large. Thus,
at present, it is difficult to assign the COO– signals
affected by the D2-K317R mutation to specific carboxylate residues.

The coupling of the Cl-1 site with the Mn4CaO5 cluster was more directly examined by NO3– replacement of Cl– in WT and D2-K317R. By taking
a double difference between the spectra of the 15NO3–- and 14NO3–-treated samples, one can abstract only the vibrations of NO3– ions coupled to the Mn4CaO5 cluster., Furthermore, via examination
of the effect of the D2-K317R mutation, the interaction of the NO3– bound to the Cl-1 site can be specifically
studied. Hasegawa et al. previously showed
using spinach PSII that NO3– replacing
Cl– near the Mn4CaO5 cluster
has asymmetric NO stretching bands only at 1450–1250 cm–1, which provided evidence that the NO3– is free from metal binding. From careful analysis
of the 14NO3–-minus-15NO3– and N16O3–-minus-N18O3– signals, they concluded that NO3– has
a rather asymmetric structure in the S1 state showing split
bands at 1415 and ∼1320 cm–1, while it has
a more symmetric structure in the S2 state showing a band
at ∼1370 cm–1.

Our 14NO3–-minus-15NO3– S2/S1 double
difference spectrum of PSII from WT Synechocystis in moderately hydrated films at 283 K (Figure a) showed band features at 1417, 1368, 1320, and 1279 cm–1 similar to those of spinach PSII (1406, 1369, 1323, and 1288 cm–1 and 1415, 1369, 1319, and 1284 cm–1 for PSII membranes and core complexes, respectively) in the pellet
forms at 250 K, indicating that the interaction of NO3– at the Cl– site(s) is very similar
between higher plants and cyanobacteria. Also, the sample forms (moderately
hydrated films vs pellets) and temperatures (283 K vs 250 K) are not
related to the frequencies of NO3– bands.
In the D2-K317R mutant, the band pattern and intensities of the NO3– signals did not change significantly (Figure b), consistent with similar binding of NO3– in the WT and mutant. Upon closer inspection,
however, it is clearly seen that the highest-frequency peak at 1417
cm–1 is upshifted to 1430 cm–1. Also, a rather broad feature around 1320 cm–1 became sharper with a peak at 1324 cm–1 and positive
peaks at 1368 and 1279 cm–1 slightly downshift and
upshift to 1365 and 1285 cm–1, respectively. Because
it is highly expected that the D2-K317R mutation predominantly perturbs
the NO3– at the Cl-1 site, these changes
indicate that the observed NO3– bands
contains the vibrations of NO3– at the
Cl-1 site. This also indicates that the NO3– at the Cl-1 site, and thus probably the Cl– ion
at this site in untreated PSII, has a specific structural coupling
with the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the interaction
is perturbed upon formation of S2. It is likely that the
observed NO3– signals are the result
of the overlap of the bands of NO3– at
the Cl-1 and Cl-2 sites, although further investigation is necessary
to prove the involvement of the NO3– signal
at the Cl-2 site.

On the basis of the assignments of the NO3– bands by Hasegawa et al.,, the highest-frequency
peak at 1417 cm–1 can be assigned to one of the
split NO stretching vibrations of 14NO3– with an asymmetric structure in the S1 state,
while the lowest-frequency peak at 1279 cm–1 can
be assigned to the other NO stretching vibration of 15NO3–. A large upshift of the former peak by
∼13 cm–1 and a smaller upshift of the latter
by ∼6 cm–1 imply a larger split of the asymmetric
NO stretching vibrations with an upshift of the center of the frequency
gap. This observation suggests that NO3– at the Cl-1 site in the S1 state has a more asymmetric
interaction and weaker hydrogen bonding in the D2- K317R mutant than
in WT. This change may be caused by the changes in the hydrogen bond
properties (e.g., acidity of the NH group, distance, and angle) and
the electrostatic interaction (a positive charge is more distributed
over the side chain in Arg than Lys) by the Lys to Arg mutation. The
change in the interaction of chloride in the Cl-1 site by this mutation
is consistent with the observation that the O2 evolution
activity of the core complexes at relatively low Cl– concentrations (&lt;10 mM) is lower for the D2-K317R mutant than
for WT [Figure S3 of the ; also consistent data were observed by Pokhrel et al.], suggestive of the reduced binding affinity
of Cl–. The biphasic curves in Figure S3 of the  could be due to the minor
heterogeneity in the preparations. This susceptibility to Cl– of the isolated core complexes, however, did not provide a drastic
effect in vivo as shown in the similar growth curves
between D2-K317R and WT even in the medium depleted of Cl– (Figure S2 of the ).

The involvement of a COOH/COO– group(s)
in the
hydrogen bond network around D2-K317 and Cl-1 was also revealed by
the change in the C=O stretching band of COOH at 1750–1740
cm–1; the negative peak at 1748 cm–1 in the untreated PSII from WT was changed to a positive peak at
1742–1743 cm–1 by both the D2-K317R mutation
and NO3– treatment upon examination in
moderately hydrated films (Figures  and ). It is presumed that the D2-K317R mutation and
the Cl– to NO3– change
affected the pKa of a nearby COOH/COO– group(s) though a hydrogen bond network. Service et
al. previously observed very similar
effects on the COOH bands by D1-E65A, D2-E312A, and D1-E329A mutations
and concluded that these residues are in a common network of hydrogen
bonds that includes water molecules and carboxylate groups and mutation
of any of these residues disrupts the network. Indeed, the X-ray structure showed that D1-E65 and D2-E312 are located near
D2-K317 with distances of 4–6 Å and mutually related through
a hydrogen bond network that includes water molecules (Figure ). Thus, it is logical that D2-K317 is also involved
in the same hydrogen bond network affecting the pKa of a COOH group(s) upon the S1 → S2 transition. The involvement of water molecules in this hydrogen
bond network was revealed by the recovery of the negative COOH band
at 1748 cm–1 when the D2-K317R mutant was examined
in solution rather than in film (Figure a).
The decrease in the intensity of the 1748 cm–1 band
by dehydration of the sample was previously reported by Service et
al. in the PSII core complexes of WT Synechocystis. Our observation of the absence of this band
in the hydrated film of the D2-K317R mutant formed at a relative humidity
of 95% (by 40% glycerol/water) despite
the presence of the band in the same hydrated film of WT indicates
that sensitivity to dehydration is increased by this mutation. These
results are consistent with the view that the carboxylate groups showing
the 1748 cm–1 band, D2-K317, and water molecules,
some of which are deleted by partial dehydration, are connected through
a common hydrogen bond network.

The carboxylate residue responsible
for the negative peak at 1748
cm–1 has not yet been identified. It could arise from several carboxylate groups involved
in the hydrogen bond network rather than one specific residue. This
view is consistent with the fact that a specific peak of the symmetric
COO– vibration coupled with the COOH band at 1748
cm–1 was not clearly identified in the 1450–1300
cm–1 region (see above). Although the carboxylate
group of D1-E329 is ∼15–20 Å from D2-K317, D1-E65,
and D2-E312, Service et al. suggested
that the postulated network extends for at least 20 Å.

FTIR spectra of the S-state cycle (Figure ) showed that the efficiency of the S3 → S0 transition significantly decreased in the moderately hydrated
film of the D2-K317R mutant. Because the PSII core complexes from
the D2-K317R mutant retained a relatively high O2 evolution
rate [2000–2900 μmol of O2 (mg of Chl)−1 h–1] and the FTIR spectra in the
solution sample of the K317R mutant exhibited better S-state cycling
(Figure ), this observation indicates that
the sensitivity of the S3 → S0 transition
to sample dehydration is increased by the K317R mutation. The FTIR
spectra of Pokhrel et al. of the hydrated
film of D2-K317R were very similar to our solution spectra of the
same mutant (Figure ), probably because of
a higher extent of hydration, which is determined by the ratio of
a glycerol/water solution enclosed in the sample cell [20% (v/v) glycerol/water
in the work of Pokhrel et al. vs 40%
in our experiment]. Service et al. also observed a decrease in the S3 → S0 efficiency caused by D1-D61A, D1-E65A, and
D2-E312A mutations and suggested the participation of these residues
in a proton egress channel from the Mn4CaO5 cluster
to the lumen. These carboxylate residues are all located near D2-K317
and connected through hydrogen bonds (Figure ). Thus, together with a hydrogen bond network involving D2-K317
that affects pKa values of COOH/COO– groups, the observation of the decrease in the efficiency
of the S3 → S0 transition suggests that
D2-K317 and the Cl-1 site are also involved in the same proton pathway
as D1-D61, D1-E65, and D2-E312. The involvement of Cl-1 in a proton
pathway is consistent with the recent molecular dynamics and Monte
Carlo simulation, in which depletion of Cl-1 induces formation of
a salt bridge between D2-K317 and D1-D61 that suppresses the proton
transfer. The X-ray structure at 1.9
Å resolution detected many water
molecules in this putative pathway. Thus, it is presumed that the
effect of mutation, which slightly altered the hydrogen bond network
in the proton pathway, was more emphasized by removal of some of these
water molecules in partially dehydrated PSII proteins. Proton release
is thought to take place in the three transitions other than the S1 → S2 transition., Because the efficiency of the S2 → S3 transition was not significantly affected by the K317R mutation
(Figure ) and the S0 → S1 transition is proposed to be unaffected by Cl– depletion, it is possible that the
proton pathway involving Cl-1 functions mainly in the S3 → S0 transition. The role of Cl– in the proton pathway in the S3 → S0 transition is consistent with the previous time-resolved UV absorption
studies, in which replacement of Cl– with other
functional monovalent ions retards the rate of the S3 →
S0 transition.,

Broser et al. recently found another
Cl– site (Cl-1B) in the vicinity of Cl-1 (Cl-1A)
but distinct from the Cl-2 site in the X-ray structure (3.2 Å
resolution) of terbutryn-bound PSII core complexes. The Cl-1B site
exhibited an even higher occupancy (∼70%) than Cl-1A (∼30%).
The Cl-1B site also interacts with the side chain of D2-K317 along
with the side chains of D1-R334 and D1-N335. Thus, we cannot fully
exclude the possibility that our observation of the effect of the
D2-K317R mutation is actually related to Cl-1B, which could be moved
from the Cl-1A site during the S-state cycle or by some other condition.

In conclusion, FTIR measurements
of the D2-K317R mutant in combination
with Cl–/NO3– replacement
have provided experimental evidence that the Cl-1 site is structurally
coupled with the Mn4CaO5 cluster and that the
D2-K317R mutation perturbs the changes in protein structure induced
by formation of the S2 state. This is consistent with the
previous FTIR studies that showed significant FTIR changes by Cl– depletion or replacement of Cl– with
nonfunctional univalent anions such as F– and acetate. However, this work is the first to show a specific
interaction of Cl-1 with the WOC. One of the roles of Cl-1 may be
to stabilize the structure of the WOC through interactions with the
protein backbone connecting two ligands (D1-E333 and D1-H332) to the
Mn4CaO5 cluster, thereby preserving a rigid
hydrogen bond network around the WOC. It was also shown that the hydrogen
bond network involving D2-K317 and Cl-1 controls the pKa of COOH/COO– groups coupled to the
Mn4CaO5 cluster. The presence of this hydrogen
bond network and the decrease in the efficiency of the S3 → S0 transition by partial dehydration of the
D2-K317R mutant suggest that D2-K317 and Cl-1 are involved in the
proton transfer pathway from the Mn4CaO5 cluster
to the lumen, which functions mainly in the S3 →
S0 transition. It is also possible that structural changes
in the Mn4CaO5 cluster during the S-state cycle
are relayed to Cl-1 through the D1-E333 and D1-H332 ligands, thereby
changing the structure and activity of the proton channel, to gate
proton transfer.
