The
multicomponent protein toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase
(ToMO) activates molecular oxygen to oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons.
Prior to dioxygen activation, two electrons are injected into each
of two diiron(III) units of the hydroxylase, a process that involves
three redox active proteins: the ToMO hydroxylase (ToMOH), Rieske
protein (ToMOC), and an NADH oxidoreductase (ToMOF). In addition to
these three proteins, a small regulatory protein is essential for
catalysis (ToMOD). Through steady state and pre-steady state kinetics
studies, we show that ToMOD attenuates electron transfer from ToMOC
to ToMOH in a concentration-dependent manner. At substoichiometric
concentrations, ToMOD increases the rate of turnover, which we interpret
to be a consequence of opening a pathway for oxygen transport to the
catalytic diiron center in ToMOH. Excess ToMOD inhibits steady state
catalysis in a manner that depends on ToMOC concentration. Through
rapid kinetic assays, we demonstrate that ToMOD attenuates formation
of the ToMOC–ToMOH complex. These data, coupled with protein
docking studies, support a competitive model in which ToMOD and ToMOC
compete for the same binding site on the hydroxylase. These results
are discussed in the context of other studies of additional proteins
in the superfamily of bacterial multicomponent monooxygenases.

Bacterial
multicomponent monooxygenases
(BMMs) comprise a family of enzymes that can hydroxylate or epoxidize
a variety of hydrocarbon substrates.1 Enzyme
systems in this superfamily contain either three or four component
proteins that are necessary for catalysis. Included are (i) a catalytic
hydroxylase housing two carboxylate-rich diiron active sites; (ii)
a 12–16 kDa regulatory protein; (iii) an NADH oxidoreductase
containing an NADH binding site, a flavin adenine dinucleotide, and
a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin cluster; and (iv) a Rieske protein that is present
only in the four-component BMMs.2 Protein
interactions involving three-component BMMs have been thoroughly discussed
in the literature.3−5 Four-component BMMs are less well investigated and
more complicated, because of their more extended electron transfer
(ET) chain. In three-component BMMs, the NADH oxidoreductase directly
reduces the diiron(III) centers in the hydroxylase, each by two electrons,
without the need for additional proteins.6−8 In contrast,
the NADH oxidoreductase of four-component BMMs is incapable of directly
reducing the hydroxylase.9 Instead, this
reduction is effected by the Rieske protein, designated ToMOC for
the four-component BMM toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase
(ToMO). Thus, either a ternary complex, involving the hydroxylase
(ToMOH), ToMOC, and the NADH-oxidoreductase (ToMOF) proteins, must
form, or sequential interactions between ToMOC and ToMOH may occur,
as diagrammatically represented for the four-component BMM, ToMO,
in Scheme 1. Scheme 1 intentionally omits any contribution from the regulatory protein,
ToMOD.

Scheme 1 Model for the Intermolecular Single-ET Events within the Four-Component
BMM, Toluene/o-Xylene Monooxygenase (ToMO)
Interactions of the regulatory protein with the hydroxylase have
been thoroughly described for the four-component BMM toluene 4-monooxygenase
(T4MO) using both equilibrium binding measurements10 and X-ray crystallography.11,12 Reported functions
of the regulatory protein include opening oxygen access to the diiron
active site of the hydroxylase13,14 and closing the entry
point for an aromatic substrate within the hydroxylase.11 The roles of the regulatory protein with respect
to ET kinetics and the function of the ET proteins remain unexplored
for four-component BMMs, however.a To address
this issue, we carried out steady state and pre-steady state experiments
with the four-component BMM ToMO from Pseudomonas sp. OX1. We find that excess ToMOD inhibits steady state turnover
and that this inhibition is dependent on the concentration of ToMOC
and the temperature of the reaction. ET studies demonstrate that the
interaction between reduced ToMOC (ToMOCred) and oxidized
ToMOH (ToMOHox) is diminished in the presence of ToMOD.
Finally, chemical cross-linking and protein docking studies support
a competitive binding model, in which ToMOC and ToMOD compete for
binding to the same region of ToMOH. These conclusions provide evidence
for a dynamic interaction of ToMOH with both ToMOD and ToMOC. Possible
functions for these interactions are discussed in the context of previous
reports on three- and four-component BMMs.

Experimental Procedures
General
Methods
Plasmids for the component proteins
of ToMO were generously provided by the Di Donato laboratory (Naples,
Italy). Expression and purification of ToMOC, ToMOD, ToMOF, and ToMOH
were carried out as reported previously.15,16 NADH and N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) were purchased from Roche and Sigma,
respectively. ToMOH is an (αβγ)2 dimer,
with carboxylate-bridged diiron centers contained in each α
subunit. In this work, the concentration of ToMOH is represented as
that of the (αβγ)2 dimer.

Steady State
Kinetics and Analysis
Reactions were examined
in 400 μL volumes of 0.1 M Tris buffer at pH 7.3. Each reaction
mixture contained 2 μM ToMOH (4 μM diiron active sites),
0.5–120 μM ToMOD, 2–16 μM ToMOC, 0.1 μM
ToMOF, and saturating levels of toluene (∼6 mM).17 Reactions were initiated by addition of NADH
to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. The absorbance change at 340 nm,
corresponding to conversion of NADH to NAD+, was monitored
as a function of time. The temperature was maintained at either 10
or 37 °C using a circulating water bath. The reaction cuvette
was held in a thermostated compartment attached to a circulating water
bath. The rate of NADH consumption was calculated by fitting the initial
absorbance change at 340 nm to a linear function. The negative slope
of this line was divided by both the extinction coefficient of NADH
(6220 M–1 cm–1) and the concentration
of ToMOH diiron sites (4 μM) to yield the NADH consumption per
diiron active site. The resulting values were plotted as a function
of ToMOD concentration. Fits to the data were examined for a standard
Michaelis–Menten model, a cooperative model, and a competitive
model (eq 1). 1  In all
cases, ToMOD was treated as a substrate,
a common method for evaluating promoter proteins.18 The competitive model was clearly best as indicated by
the lowest adjusted R2, the lowest error
of the fitted parameters, and residual values closest to zero.

Colorimetric
Reductive Titrations
Anaerobic titrations
were performed in sealed cuvettes in 50 mM potassium phosphate and
50 mM NaCl (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. In a nitrogen-filled chamber, solutions
of 40–50 μM ToMOC and either 40 μM anthraquinone-1,5-sulfonic
acid (Em° = −175 mV vs NHE),19 100 μM 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (Em° = −137 mV vs NHE),20 or 17.5 μM indigo carmine (Em° = −125 mV vs NHE)21 were prepared. Each solution was sealed in a quartz cuvette with
a screw cap equipped with a rubber septum. A buffered dithionite solution
was loaded into a gastight Hamilton syringe with a repeating dispenser.
The syringe and cuvette were removed from the anaerobic chamber, and
each ToMOC/dye solution was titrated with the buffered solution of
dithionite. An HP diode array spectrometer was used to monitor the
UV–vis spectrum of the sample throughout the course of the
titration. The solution was allowed to reach equilibrium, which was
achieved when no further absorbance change was observed (5–30
min). The equilibrium absorbance spectrum for each titration point
was fit to a linear combination of oxidized and reduced absorbance
spectra of ToMOC and the dye (eq 2). The reduction
potential of ToMOC was determined from a modified Nernst equation
(eq 3)22 2   3  where Edye°′ and EToMOC°′ are the midpoint potentials of
the dye and ToMOC, respectively; ndye and nToMOC are the number of electrons that the components
can acquire upon reduction; F is Faraday’s
constant; and E is the equilibrium midpoint potential
of the solution.

Stopped-Flow Kinetics and Analysis for Single-Wavelength
Measurements
Single-wavelength kinetic data were obtained
using a Hi-Tech Scientific
(Salisbury, U.K.) SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped
with a photomultiplier tube and a tungsten lamp. To remove oxygen
from the reaction lines, the instrument was scrubbed overnight with
anaerobic buffer containing ∼5 mM sodium dithionite. Immediately
prior to each experiment, the stopped-flow lines were washed with
dithionite-free, anaerobic buffer to remove any excess dithionite.
Reactions were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate and 50 mM
NaCl at pL 7.0. The pD was calculated by adding 0.4 to the value reported
by the pH meter. The temperature was held constant using a circulating
water bath. Temperatures for all stopped-flow reactions were 13 °C,
except where noted otherwise. Protein samples were made anaerobic
by cycling between vacuum and argon using a Schlenk line. The anaerobic
protein samples were brought into a chamber filled with a nitrogen
atmosphere for handling prior to stopped-flow analysis. In the nitrogen
chamber, the two reactants were loaded into separate Hamilton Sample-Lock
syringes equipped with a male luer adapter. The syringes were sealed
and removed from the nitrogen atmosphere for loading onto the prewashed
stopped-flow. Protein concentrations listed for stopped-flow experiments
are concentrations after rapid mixing of the reaction components.
Three or more individual traces were averaged to obtain the final
traces shown here. The data were analyzed using OriginLabs 9.0 or
9.1. Single- and double-exponential fits were compared as models for
each of the averaged traces.

For reactions between ToMOCred and ToMOHox, ToMOCred was prepared
by titrating ToMOCox with a buffered solution of dithionite
under a nitrogen atmosphere. When the regulatory protein was included,
ToMOD was added to the syringe containing either ToMOHox or ToMOCred. Using the stopped-flow, the absorbance change
at 458 nm was monitored for each reaction condition. This wavelength
provides the greatest difference in molar extinction coefficient for
the oxidized and reduced forms of ToMOC. Single-exponential fits were
adequate to fit all experimental traces. In some cases, double-exponential
fits resulted in lower adjusted R2 values.
However, in all cases, double-exponential fits also produced greater
errors of the fitted parameters. The error for double-exponential
fits was greater than 10 times the output parameter. For this reason,
double-exponential fits were not further considered.

Stopped-Flow
Kinetics and Analysis for Multiwavelength Measurements
Multiwavelength
kinetic data were obtained using a Hi-Tech Scientific
SF-61 DX2 stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a diode array
detector and a xenon lamp. Anaerobic preparation of the stopped-flow
was the same as indicated for single-wavelength measurements (above).
Reactions were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate and 50 mM
sodium chloride at pH 7.0 and 13 °C. Under a nitrogen atmosphere,
reduced ToMOF (ToMOFred) was prepared by adding 1.5 equiv
of NADH. ToMOCox and ToMOFred were loaded into
separate Hamilton Sample-Lock syringes equipped with a male luer lock.
Absorbance changes from 380 to 750 nm were monitored as a function
of time. The reaction was very fast (complete in 15 ms), such that
only the first three data points displayed a change in absorbance.
Because of the speed of the reaction, the absorbance traces are shown
and discussed but were not fit to a kinetic model.

Cross-Linking
Experiments
A solution of 120 μM
ToMOC or ToMOF and 60 μM ToMOH was prepared in 25 mM MOPS buffer
at pH 7.0. For reaction mixtures containing the regulatory protein,
ToMOD was added to a final concentration of 120 μM. The zero-atom
cross-linking agent EDC was added to the protein solution to a final
concentration of 450 mM. The reaction mixture was kept on ice for
1 h. An equal volume of 1 M sodium acetate and 25 mM MOPS at pH 6.8
was added after 1 h to quench the reaction. The products were loaded
onto a Sephadex S200 column (1.6 cm × 60 cm). The protein was
eluted with 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol (v/v), and 150 mM NaCl.
Fractions of 3 mL were collected throughout the elution. The fractions
were analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy. The absorbance at 280
and 458 nm was plotted as a function of elution volume.

Results
and Discussion
Effect of ToMOD and ToMOC Concentration on
Steady State Activity
To assess the effects of ToMOD on catalysis,
we performed steady
state reactions with varying concentrations of ToMOD. Influenced by
prior reports with three-component BMMs,4 we assessed activity at both 10 and 37 °C (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Steady state activity as a function of ToMOD concentration
at 10
°C (○) and 37 °C (■). Reactions of 2 μM
ToMOH, 4 μM ToMOC, 0.5–120 μM ToMOD, 0.1 μM
ToMOF, and saturating amounts of toluene (∼6 mM) were initiated
by addition of 0.2 mM NADH. The rate of NADH consumption as a function
of ToMOD concentration fit well to a ToMOD inhibition model (eq 1
of the Supporting Information). The vertical,
dashed line in the figure demarcates a 1:1 ratio of ToMOD to ToMOH
diiron sites.

At substoichiometric
concentrations of ToMOD, the rate of NADH
consumption increases with increasing ToMOD concentration at both
10 and 37 °C. Under these conditions, ToMOD acts as a promoter
protein. X-ray crystallography indicates that promotion by ToMOD arises
through conformational changes exerted on ToMOH upon binding of ToMOD.
These conformational changes within the hydroxylase enable dioxygen
access to the diiron active site and subsequent oxygen activation.13,14 With excess ToMOD, however, we observed an inhibitory effect, Ki,ToMOD.b Importantly,
ToMOD is much more effective at inhibiting the reaction at 37 °C
than at 10 °C.

Similar steady state experiments were performed
with varying concentrations
of ToMOC (Figure 2 and Table 1).

Figure 2 Steady state activity at various concentrations of ToMOC graphed
as a function of ToMOD concentration. At 37 °C, the rate of NADH
consumption as a function of ToMOD concentration was determined for
varying concentrations of ToMOC, 4 μM (black squares), 8 μM
(red circles), 10 μM (blue triangles), and 16 μM (pink
inverted-triangles). Each reaction mixture contained 2 μM ToMOH,
0.1 μM ToMOF, saturating toluene, and 0.2 mM NADH.

Upon increasing the concentration of ToMOC, there
are significant
shifts in the apparent kcat, Km,ToMOD, and Ki,ToMOD values,
as numerically shown in Table 1. The most dramatic
change is in the Ki,ToMOD, which reflects
much weaker ToMOD inhibition at high concentrations of ToMOC. The
dependence of Ki,ToMOD on ToMOC concentration
demonstrates that the inhibitory function of ToMOD is linked to the
action of ToMOC.

Table 1 Steady State Parameters
[ToMOC] (μM)	kcat (s–1)	Km,ToMOD (μM)	Ki,ToMOD (μM)	
4	1.88(5)	0.57(6)	44(4)	
6	2.00(5)	0.75(8)	60(5)	
10	2.5(2)	0.8(1)	110(30)	
16	2.34(6)	0.87(9)	330(50)	
X-ray crystallographic data indicate that binding
of the T4MO regulatory
protein to its hydroxylase covers the entrance to the aromatic substrate
channel and shrinks its diameter.11,12 Attenuation
of substrate access may therefore also contribute to inhibition at
the higher ToMOD concentrations. To assess this possibility directly,
steady state experiments with varying concentrations of ToMOD were
performed at 0.75 and 5 mM toluene (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Turnover as a function of toluene and ToMOD concentrations. At
37 °C, the rate of NADH consumption as a function of ToMOD concentration
was determined at 0.75 mM (■) and 5.0 mM (○) toluene.
Each reaction mixture contained 2 μM ToMOH, 2 μM ToMOC,
0.1 μM ToMOF, toluene, and 0.2 mM NADH.

The kcat,ToMOD increases from
2.1(1)
s–1 at 0.75 mM toluene to 2.7(4) s–1 at 5 mM toluene. In contrast, Ki,ToMOD is unaltered, yielding values of 14(2) and 17(5) μM for 0.75
and 5 mM toluene, respectively. Thus, covering of the aromatic substrate
channel by ToMOD does not affect Ki,ToMOD under the conditions presented here. Instead, this inhibition constant
depends directly on ToMOC concentration. The data provide further
support for the model involving direct competition between ToMOC and
ToMOD for binding to the hydroxylase. This result may arise either
through competition for the same binding location or by one protein
at the same site triggering allosteric changes that alter the conformation
of ToMOH and affect the binding of the other protein at a remote site.

The sites of the interaction between BMM regulatory proteins and
their respective hydroxylases are well documented.11,12,23,24 The regulatory
proteins bind to the hydroxylases in a region originally termed the
“canyon” for the first BMM hydroxylase characterized
by X-ray crystallography, sMMOH25 from
soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). Subsequent X-ray crystallography
demonstrated that the canyon region occurs in all members of the BMM
family.12,23,26 The canyon
is defined by a significant depression at the surface of these hydroxylases
formed between α and
β subunits across the dimer interface. The shortest distance
between the diiron active sites and the surface of the hydroxylases,
∼12 Å, exits at one of the canyon walls, the locale of
regulatory protein binding.12,23,24 Although short distances are not required for biochemical ET,27−29 binding of ToMOC to ToMOH in the canyon would provide the most efficient
distance for ET.30 If ToMOC were to bind
in the canyon, which we consider to be quite likely for efficient
ET, ToMOD would compete with ToMOC for binding to ToMOH.

Electron Transfer
To assess competition between ToMOD
and ToMOC for binding to ToMOH, we evaluated intermolecular ET. Monitoring
ET provides a direct assessment of inhibition without the need to
unravel the complex kinetics of steady state turnover involving four
protein components and multiple substrates. In these investigations,
we examined the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ET from ToMOCred to ToMOH by exploiting redox-dependent absorbance features
of ToMOC. Upon oxidation of ToMOCred, the absorbance at
458 nm increases 2-fold (Supporting Information), allowing for kinetic characterization of ET to and from ToMOC
as well as facile redox determination by colorimetric methods. The
midpoint potential of ToMOC was determined by a colorimetric reductive
titration to be −130(30) mV versus NHE (Supporting Information). This midpoint potential is near that
reported for T4moC (−173 mV vs NHE)31 and lies between those expected for the [2Fe-2S] cluster of ToMOF
(−205 mV vs NHE at 25 °C)32 and the diiron center in ToMOH (+48 mV vs NHE at 4 °C).5 These results indicate that the Rieske cluster
of ToMOC is thermodynamically suitable for shuttling electrons from
the redox centers of ToMOF to the redox centers of ToMOH. ET from
the reduced ToMOF to ToMOCox is rapid (complete in &lt;15
s) and much faster than steady state turnover (Supporting Information). Despite this limitation with respect
to kinetic quantitation, these results demonstrate that ET between
ToMOF and ToMOC is not rate-limiting along the ET pathway and that
a ternary complex involving ToMOF, ToMOC, and ToMOH is not necessary
for ET from ToMOF to ToMOC.

We next assessed ET to ToMOHox from ToMOCred as monitored by stopped-flow UV–vis
spectroscopy. The data were obtained using limiting concentrations
of ToMOCred, such that only a single electron would be
transferred to the hydroxylase to form one-electron reduced, mixed-valent
ToMOH (ToMOHmv). Figure 4 shows
the observed rate constants derived from single-exponential fits of
the absorbance change at 458 nm. At excess ToMOH, the observed rate
constant depends linearly upon the concentration of ToMOH, from which
a second-order rate constant of 0.42(5) μM–1 s–1 could be derived (Figure 4), consistent with a bimolecular reaction between the two
proteins. The observed absorbance change corresponded to complete
oxidation of ToMOCred. At ToMOH concentrations of ≥200
μM, the solution viscosity began to affect the instrument mixing
time, and it was not possible to obtain meaningful results in this
range. These data do not permit the evaluation of the true ET reaction
(see the Supporting Information for more
complete studies). The role of ToMOD in this reaction is discussed
in the following section.

Figure 4 ET from ToMOCred to ToMOHox as a function
of ToMOH concentration. kobs values for
the reaction between 5 μM ToMOCred and varying concentrations
of ToMOHox at pH 7.0 and 13 °C. The data fit well
to a linear function with a slope of 0.42(5) μM–1 s–1.

Effect of ToMOD on ET
With the use of pre-steady state
single-mixing stopped-flow experiments, we examined the effect of
increasing concentrations of ToMOD, premixed with ToMOHox, on electron transfer from ToMOCred. Under these conditions,
the observed rate constant for ET decreased significantly as the concentration
of ToMOD increased. Figure 5 shows the average
absorbance change at increasing concentrations of ToMOD. A control
experiment revealed that preincubation of ToMOD with ToMOCred did not change the results from those obtained in the absence of
ToMOD (Supporting Information, Figure S6).
Thus, ToMOD slows the reaction between ToMOCred and ToMOHox through its interaction with ToMOH. An inhibitory effect
upon ET could be a consequence of competitive binding, noncooperative
allosteric effects including conformational changes, or an alteration
of the ToMOH redox potential in the presence of ToMOD. The last possibility
is suggested by the finding that, for the three-component BMM soluble
methane monooxygenase (sMMO), addition of the regulatory protein to
the hydroxylase shifts the redox potential to a more negative value.5 Thus, alteration of the redox potential of ToMOH
by ToMOD binding would not be unprecedented. Attenuation of the redox
potential of ToMOH by ToMOD, however, would not give rise to a Ki,ToMOD that depends on ToMOC concentration,
as we report here on the basis of steady state data. Therefore, we
propose either that ToMOD and ToMOC compete for binding to the same
location on ToMOH or that ToMOD enforces allosteric effects on ToMOH,
inhibiting ET from ToMOCred to ToMOHox throughout
turnover.

Figure 5 ET from ToMOCred to ToMOHox preincubated
with ToMOD. The absorbance at 458 nm was monitored for the reaction
between ToMOCred and ToMOHox preincubated with
0 μM (black), 25 μM (green), 50 μM (orange), and
125 μM (violet) ToMOD. The absorbance change at 458 nm over
time is plotted on a logarithmic scale (top), and the observed rate
constants obtained from single-exponential fits of the data are shown
as a function of the ratio of ToMOD to ToMOH diiron sites (bottom).

Binding Interactions
To verify further that ToMOC and
ToMOH interact and that this interaction is perturbed by ToMOD, we
studied the binding of these proteins by use of the zero-atom cross-linking
agent EDC. The cross-linking reaction was analyzed by gel chromatography
to separate the products by size without denaturation. Absorbance
measurements (Figure 6) were obtained for isolated
fractions from the column flow-through. The absorbance at 458 nm was
used as a way to determine the ToMOC retention time. The elution volumes
for ToMOC and ToMOH alone are 80 and 60 mL, respectively (Figure 6, black traces). When ToMOC and ToMOH were incubated
with EDC, the elution point of ToMOC shifted to 55 mL, overlapping
with the peak of ToMOH alone (Figure 6, red
traces). The reduction of retention time demonstrates that cross-linking
of the two proteins increases the hydrodynamic radius of both ToMOH
and ToMOC, showing that the two proteins bind in solution. In the
presence of ToMOD, the absorption intensity at 458 nm was much stronger
in the low-molecular weight fraction than in the high-molecular weight
fraction. This result indicates that cross-linking of ToMOC and ToMOH
is less efficient in the presence of ToMOD (Figure 6, purple traces), consistent with competition between ToMOD
and ToMOC for a binding site on ToMOH. This result cannot distinguish
between allosteric and direct competition for such a location.

Figure 6 Cross-linking
of ToMOC and ToMOH in the presence and absence of
ToMOD. Values of absorbance at 458 nm (top) and 280 nm (bottom) as
a function of elution volume are shown. Elution of ToMOC alone is
shown with a solid black line; elution of ToMOH alone is shown with
a dotted black line. Elution of the reaction mixture of ToMOC, ToMOH,
and the cross-linking agent EDC is shown as a red trace with red dots.
Elution of the reaction mixture of ToMOC, ToMOH, ToMOD, and the cross-linking
agent EDC is shown as a purple trace with empty squares. Absorbance
measurements at 458 nm were performed for each fraction, whereas absorbance
measurements at 280 nm were an output from the Äkta fast protein
liquid chromatography system.

ToMOF, on the other hand, did not cross-link with ToMOH under
the
same reaction conditions (Supporting Information). This result demonstrates that ToMOF would be incapable of transferring
electrons to ToMOH because the two proteins cannot bind one another,
a conclusion that is supported by the fact that there is no steady
state activity in the ToMO system in the absence of ToMOC.9

Finally, to distinguish between direct
competition and indirect
allosteric inhibition, we used a computational approach involving
an automated protein docking program.33−35 Guided by X-ray crystal
structure information,12,26,36,37 we examined binding between T4moC and either
ToMOH, T4moH, or the T4moHD complex.c The T4MO
proteins used for this docking model are highly homologous with ToMO,
display similar chemistry,9,38 and have known structures
from X-ray crystallography.10−12 When T4moC was docked to either
hydroxylase alone, the preferred binding site was conclusively at
the canyon regions of the proteins (Figure 7A). This binding mode was similar for all 10 of the lowest-energy
predictions (Chart S1 of the Supporting Information). When the T4moHD complex was used, the best predicted T4moC binding
site was nonsensical for efficient ET (Figure 7B), being far removed from the hydroxylase diiron center, and not
conserved among the 10 lowest-energy structures provided by the docking
model (Chart S2 of the Supporting Information). Upon removal of one of the two regulatory proteins from the hydroxylase
complex, T4moC bound to the canyon region on the side of T4moH from
which ToMOD was removed (Figure 7C). In this
case, the 10 lowest-energy structures all revealed binding of T4moC
in a canyon region of the hydroxylase (Chart S3 of the Supporting Information). Use of the docking program
necessitated removal of the 2Fe-2S Rieske cluster (see page 1 of the Supporting Information), which limits our ability
to compute a distance for ET. The model nonetheless is consistent
with a competitive binding model supported by ET and steady state
turnover presented here and a recent X-ray crystal structure.a

Comparison of Three- and
Four-Component BMMs: Conserved Control
of Electron Transfer
The BMM regulatory proteins have been
shown (i) to couple NADH consumption with hydrocarbon oxidation,39 (ii) to gate hydrocarbon substrate11 and dioxygen13,14 access to
the diiron active sites, and (iii) to alter the redox potential of
the catalytic diiron active site.5,40 Competition
between the reductase and regulatory protein of the three-component
BMM, sMMO, has been described in detail.3,4,41 Recent studies of soluble butane monooxygenase (sBMO)
also reveal a dual promotion and inhibition effect of the regulatory
protein on turnover.42 Because the Rieske
protein of the four-component BMMs is much smaller than the NADH oxidoreductase
of three-component BMMs, the Rieske protein might bind to the hydroxylase
in a ternary complex with the regulatory protein. The present results,
however, indicate that competitive binding between the electron transfer
partner of the hydroxylase and the regulatory proteins is retained
even in four-component BMMs. Additional evidence for competitive binding
is available (see footnote a), which agrees
with our conclusions. Conservation of this competition in both three-
and four-component BMMs reveals that nature has preserved this mechanism
despite radically altering the ET partners, suggesting that this feature
of catalysis is indispensible. Competitive binding between the ET
and regulatory proteins may provide a mechanism for controlling unwanted
ET during dioxygen activation protecting the oxygen-activated intermediates
from unwanted reduction.3,41,43

a While this paper was in revision,
a related study of T4MO appeared,43 to
which we draw the reader’s attention. These structural studies
for T4MO are consistent with the results and conclusions presented
here.

b The ratio of ToMOC to
diiron sites
in ToMOH is 1:1 for the data in Figure 1. At
this ratio, maximal NADH consumption occurs at a 1:1 ratio of ToMOD
to ToMOH diiron sites, which was the first indication of binding competition
or allostery during steady state catalysis.

c The Rieske, regulatory, and hydroxylase
proteins of T4MO are designated T4moC, T4moD, and T4moH, respectively.
The complex of T4moH with two regulatory proteins is termed T4moHD.
