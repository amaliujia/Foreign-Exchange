14-3-3s are well-known universal adapter proteins of small size
(28–30 kDa), which are widely distributed among eukaryotes.
These proteins participate in multiple cellular processes due to their
ability to recognize over 300 partner proteins. The partner proteins usually contain phosphorylated Ser/Thr
within one of the three established consensus motifs., It is thought that 14-3-3s act as homo- and/or heterodimers formed
by different isoforms encoded by distinct genes. The dimeric cup-like structure of the 14-3-3 is extremely stable. Stability of 14-3-3 was put into a
basis of the popular “molecular anvil hypothesis”, according
to which the rigid 14-3-3 dimer can force structural rearrangements
in some partner molecules, thereby regulating their activity and properties. Binding of 14-3-3 can stabilize the structure
of certain target proteins and prevent their dephosphorylation and/or
degradation., Indeed, phosphorylation followed by 14-3-3
binding plays an important role in regulation of apoptosis, cell division,
signal transduction, ion-channels functioning, etc. 14-3-3s bind diverse protein targets and can also prevent
aggregation of certain model protein substrates.− This chaperone-like
activity of 14-3-3 is not strictly dependent on target protein phosphorylation− and was suggested to play an important role in pathogenesis of certain
neurodegenerative diseases., It was proposed that
the phosphopeptide binding and a chaperone-like action of 14-3-3 are
functionally and structurally separated; however, until now the exact regions responsible for chaperone-like
activity of 14-3-3 have not been identified.

Until recently
the dimeric form of 14-3-3 was considered to be
crucial for most of its activities. Phosphorylation
of Ser58 located at the dimer interface can regulate the
dimeric state of 14-3-3, and phosphomimicking
mutation S58E induces partial dissociation of 14-3-3 dimers. However, the presence and functional activity
of 14-3-3 monomers remain questionable. It is known that a 14-3-3
dimer, having two binding sites, interacts with doubly phosphorylated
peptides with 30-fold higher affinity than with singly phosphorylated
peptides. Therefore it appears that upon
dissociation 14-3-3 will lose its ability to regulate partners that
have more than one 14-3-3-binding site. Moreover, the dimeric state
of 14-3-3 was proposed and further demonstrated to be essential for stability of 14-3-3 in vivo.
However, 14-3-3 monomers participating in the 14-3-3 homo- and heterodimer
formation and accumulating upon phosphorylation of Ser58 by a range of protein kinases still
possess phosphopeptide binding site and hypothetically can retain
some functionality and even can acquire a new one. Intriguingly, the
recently discovered alternatively spliced monomeric variant of human
14-3-3ε lacking the first 22 N-terminal residues was sufficient
to protect HEK293 cells from UV-induced apoptosis by a yet unknown
mechanism.

Thus, despite an attractiveness
of the hypothesis postulating instability
of 14-3-3 monomers and their inability to interact with and to regulate
their partners, the real situation appears to be more complex. Indeed,
studies using artificial dimer-deficient mutants showed that the monomeric
14-3-3 can bind Raf kinase (but is unable to regulate its activity) and interact with cytoplasmic part of the glycoprotein
Ibα (GPIbα). Using the Drosophila system, the monomeric form was shown to interact
with and modulate activity of a slowpoke calcium-dependent potassium
channel. However, all these investigations
were performed at a cellular level on dimer-deficient mutants of 14-3-3,
which were not characterized structurally. Therefore, the question
remained whether these mutant proteins were good model systems for
in vitro and in vivo studies. Earlier we found that substitution of
only three amino acids at the dimer interface of the human 14-3-3ζ
(12LAE14 → 12QQR14) leads to a complete dissociation of 14-3-3ζ without
affecting its helical folding. We also
demonstrated that such monomeric mutant of 14-3-3ζ interacts
with phosphorylated small heat shock protein HspB6 (Hsp20) with affinity
comparable to (or even higher than) that of the wild type (WT) dimeric
protein.

In the present study we
have characterized the interaction of the
monomeric 14-3-3ζ mutant with phosphorylated HspB6 (pHspB6)
by several biophysical and biochemical methods. We found that the
14-3-3ζ monomer can be significantly stabilized upon interaction
with the phosphorylated target. We also compared the chaperone-like
activities of the HspB6 and the wild type dimeric 14-3-3ζ with
that of the monomeric 14-3-3ζ and demonstrated that the monomeric
protein has the highest chaperone-like activity, effectively preventing
a heat-induced aggregation of myosin subfragment 1 (S1).

Experimental Procedures
Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification
cDNA
of the full-length wild type human 14-3-3ζ was cloned into pET23b
vector using NdeI and XhoI restriction
sites as described earlier. The resulting
plasmid was used for creation of the so-called WMW monomeric mutant
form of 14-3-3 (here, 14-3-3ζm), carrying three amino
acid replacements of 12LAE14 by 12QQR14. The WT human HspB6
(Hsp20) was also cloned into pET23b using NdeI and XhoI sites as described earlier. Like 14-3-3ζm, S16D mutant of HspB6 was obtained
by the site-directed mutagenesis as described earlier., The integrity and correctness of all constructs were verified by
DNA sequencing in Evrogen (Moscow, Russia, http://evrogen.ru/).

Corresponding plasmids were used to transform chemically
competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS or Rosetta
cells. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG. Protein purification included ammonium sulfate
fractionation followed by anion-exchange chromatography using a High
Trap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and size-exclusion chromatography
using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit skeletal
myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was prepared by chymotrypsinolysis of myosin
filaments. All proteins were homogeneous
according to the SDS–PAGE. Protein
concentrations were measured by absorbance at 280 nm.

Phosphorylation of HspB6
HspB6 was phosphorylated by
catalytic subunit of a recombinant mouse protein kinase A (PKA). The reaction was started by addition of PKA
and lasted for 1 h at 37 °C. EDTA was added up to the final concentration
of 10 mM to stop the reaction. The 100 μL aliquots of reaction
mixture were frozen and stored at −20 °C. This procedure
led to incorporation of approximately one mole of phosphate per mole
of HspB6 and was accompanied by an increase in the electrophoretic
mobility of HspB6 on the native gel electrophoresis as observed earlier.

Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation Coupled with Multiangle
Laser Light Scattering (AF4-MALLS)
AF4 was performed using
an Agilent autosampler and pump connected to a Wyatt Eclipse 3+ Separation
System (Wyatt Technology Corp., USA). Detection included an Agilent
UV detector (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA) as well as Dawn HELEOS
II online multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector and OptilabT-Rex
differential refractive index (RI) detector (both Wyatt Technology).
Separations were performed using a 5-kDa MW cutoff regenerated cellulose
membrane (Microdyn-Nadir GmbH, Germany) in the 275-mm channel with
350-μm thick spacer. The samples (0.5–2 mg/mL) were prepared
in AF4 buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 15 mM ME) and loaded in 40 μL volume (20–80
μg of protein per load). The collected light scattering data
were fitted to the Zimm formalism using Astra v5.3.4 software (Wyatt
Technology) for calculation of weight-averaged molar mass.

Limited Chymotrypsinolysis
Chymotrypsinolysis was performed
in buffer C (20 mM Tris/acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT) at
37 °C and the weight ratio TLCK-treated chymotrypsin/substrate
equal to 1:1000–1:5000. Isolated unphosphorylated or phosphorylated
HspB6 (pHspB6) (0.52 mg/mL or 29 μM per monomer), isolated 14-3-3ζ
WT or 14-3-3ζm (0.81 mg/mL or 29 μM per monomer),
or the mixtures of unphosphorylated/phosphorylated HspB6 with either
14-3-3ζ WT or 14-3-3ζm were incubated with
protease for different time intervals; each reaction was stopped by
addition of the SDS-sample buffer containing PMSF up to the final
concentration of 2 mM. The samples were boiled and analyzed by SDS–PAGE
on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Quantitative densitometry was performed
using ImageJ 1.45s software. To determine the nature of proteolytic
peptides samples were collected after 60 min incubation (weight ratio
protease/substrate of 1:1000), each reaction was stopped by addition
of 2 mM PMSF. Desalted samples were analyzed using MALDI TOF/TOF ultrafleXtreme
mass-spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) and using the massXpert software.

To analyze the effect of phosphate on
14-3-3 chymotrypsinolysis, we used two buffers with identical ionic
strength, but different composition, namely, 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer
(pH 7.5), containing 115 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT or 50 mM Na-phosphate
buffer (pH 7.5), containing 2 mM DTT. 14-3-3ζm (0.81
mg/mL) or BSA (0.5 mg/mL) as a control were incubated for 25 min at
37 °C in these buffers and then subjected to chymotrypsinolysis.
The weight ratio TLCK-chymotrypsin/substrate was 1:1000 in the case
of 14-3-3 and 1:200 in the case of BSA. The protein composition of
the samples was analyzed by SDS–PAGE followed by quantitative
densitometry.

CD Spectroscopy
Far-UV CD spectra of HspB6 or pHspB6
(0.4 mg/mL), 14-3-3ζ WT, and 14-3-3ζm (0.6
mg/mL) were recorded at 20 °C in buffer CD (8 mM HEPES/Na (pH
7.3), 25 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT). All spectra
were recorded in the range of 190–260 nm at a rate of 0.5 nm/min
in 0.2 mm cell on a Chirascan circular dichroism spectrometer (Applied
Photophysics).

To determine the thermal stability of proteins,
14-3-3ζm alone (0.6 mg/mL or 22 μM per monomer)
or its equimolar mixture with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated HspB6
(22 μM) was incubated in buffer CD for 30 min at 37 °C.
Samples were further heated with a rate of 1 °C/min in the range
of 20–70 °C with simultaneous registration of ellipticity
at 222 nm. The data were transformed into dependence of the fraction
of folded protein [(ΘT,°C –
Θ70°C)/(Θ20°C −Θ70°C)*100%] on temperature (T, °C). By plotting d[Θ222]/dT against temperature, we were
able to determine maxima corresponding to the thermal transition of
isolated proteins or their mixture.

Fluorescence Measurements
Intrinsic Trp fluorescence
of HspB6 and pHspB6 (0.055–0.16 mg/mL or 3–9 μM
per monomer) was recorded at 25 °C in buffer F (20 mM HEPES/Na,
pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 15 mM ME). Fluorescence
was excited at 297 nm and recorded in the range of 310–400
nm (slits width 5 nm) on a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian
Inc.).

Fluorescence spectroscopy was also used for registration
of temperature-induced changes in protein structure. 14-3-3ζm alone (0.2 mg/mL or 7 μM per monomer) or its mixture
with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated HspB6 (7 μM per monomer)
was incubated in buffer F for 20–30 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence
was excited at 297 nm (slit width 5 nm) and recorded at 320 or 365
nm (slit width 2.5 nm). The protein samples were heated in the range
of 15–80 °C with the rate of 1 °C/min in automatic
Peltier Multicell Holder of Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian
Inc.) and cooled back with the same rate. For determination of the
half-transition temperatures, we plotted completeness of transition
determined by the method of Permyakov and Burstein against temperature.

To investigate protein aggregation
induced by elevated temperatures,
we also monitored light scattering of the samples during its heating
from 15 up to 80 °C with 1 °C/min rate. The light scattering
was recorded by enlightening the sample at 350 nm and measuring scattering
at 355 nm (slits width 5 nm). All data were corrected for retardation
of the temperature inside the cell, compared to the cell holder, during
heating.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
DSC was used
to analyze thermal denaturation of 14-3-3ζ WT, its S58E and
S58E/S184E/T232E mutants mimicking naturally occurring phosphorylation, and also for estimation of the thermal stability
of 14-3-3ζm and HspB6. Protein samples containing
14-3-3ζ WT or 14-3-3ζm (0.9 mg/mL or 32 μM
per monomer), phosphorylated or unphosphorylated HspB6 (0.9 mg/mL
or 50 μM per monomer), or the mixture of 14-3-3ζm with either HspB6 or pHspB6 (32 μM of 14-3-3 and 50 μM
of HspB6) in buffer DSC (30 mM HEPES/Na buffer, pH 7.3, containing
100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) were heated at a constant rate
of 1 °C/min from 5° up to 85 °C on a DASM-4 M differential
scanning calorimeter (Institute for Biological Instrumentation, Pushchino,
Russia). The thermal unfolding of all proteins studied was fully irreversible
as judged from comparison with a second heating of the same sample.
Calorimetric curves were corrected for instrumental background as
described earlier and transition temperature
(Tm) was determined from the maximum of
the thermal transition.

Thermal Aggregation of Myosin Subfragment 1 (S1)
Aggregation
of isolated S1 (0.46 mg/mL) or its aggregation in the presence of
14-3-3ζm, 14-3-3ζ WT, or HspB6 at different
S1/chaperone weight ratios (1:0.1–1:1) was monitored by measuring
an apparent absorbance at 360 nm at 43 °C in 20 mM HEPES/Na buffer
(pH 7.0), containing 115 mM NaCl and 4 mM DTT. Under these conditions
aggregation of S1 started after 20–30 min incubation at 43
°C. All measurements were performed on a Cary 100 UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) equipped with a Biomelt multicell
holder.

Results
14-3-3ζm Interacts with Phosphorylated HspB6,
but not with Its Phosphomimicking Mutant (S16D) or Unphosphorylated
HspB6
To investigate the interaction between 14-3-3ζm and HspB6 and to estimate molecular mass and stoichiometry
of the complex, we used asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4)
coupled with multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) detector and
refractometer. In this system the smaller particles were focused and
eluted first followed by particles of larger size. This system provides
information about homogeneity and molecular masses of molecules that
are separated by size.

14-3-3ζm eluted as a
narrow peak (Figure A; curve 1) corresponding
to monodisperse particles with a mass of 27.8 ± 0.3 kDa and polydispersity
index (PDI) of 1.01 ± 0.01 (). These values are in good agreement with our previous
data. HspB6 was eluted as a broad peak
with a maximum at 14.5–15 min (Figure A; curve 2). However, HspB6 was also almost monodisperse () with the PDI of 1.02 ± 0.08 and
was likely presented by dimers (Mw = 33.9
kDa ± 0.9 kDa), having different conformation in solution. When
14-3-3ζm was mixed with phosphomimicking mutant of
HspB6 (S16D) or with unphosphorylated HspB6 the elution profile was
indistinguishable from the algebraic sum of the profiles corresponding
to isolated proteins (Figure A; compare curves
1 + 2 and 3). This means that 14-3-3ζm does not interact
with either phosphomimicking mutant of HspB6 (S16D) or with unphosphorylated
HspB6. However the elution profile changed significantly when HspB6
phosphorylated by PKA was mixed with 14-3-3ζm (Figure A, curves 4 and 5). In this case the elution profile
was substantially different from the algebraic sum of elution profiles
of isolated 14-3-3ζ and HspB6 (Figure A; compare curves 4 and 5 with curve 1 + 2). When the mixture subjected
to fractionation contained an excess of 14-3-3ζm,
we detected two peaks, apparently corresponding to free 14-3-3ζm and to the complex of 14-3-3ζm with phosphorylated
HspB6 (Figure A; curve 4). In the case of
an equimolar mixture of 14-3-3ζm and phosphorylated
HspB6, we observed only one peak corresponding to the complex formed
by these two proteins (Figure A; curve 5).
Moreover, the fractions from this peak contained equal quantities
of both proteins (Figure B), again indicating
formation of the complex in a 1:1 molar ratio. This conclusion was
finally confirmed by the mass distribution of the particles eluted
in the peak corresponding to this complex (). The complex formed by the two proteins was almost monodisperse
(PDI = 1.01 ± 0.02) with a molecular mass of 45.0 ± 1.0
kDa that correlates well with the sum of the calculated masses of
14-3-3ζ (27.75 kDa) and HspB6 (17.14 kDa) monomers.

Interaction
of 14-3-3ζm with HspB6 analyzed by
asymmetric flow field flow fractionation. (A) Elution profiles of
14-3-3ζm (47 μM; curve 1), pHspB6 (33 μM;
curve 2), the mixture of 14-3-3ζm with S16D mutant
of HspB6 (47 μM of 14-3-3ζm and 33 μM
of HspB6; curve 3), the mixture of 14-3-3ζm with
pHspB6 (47 μM of 14-3-3ζm and 33 μM of
HspB6; curve 4), and equimolar complex of 14-3-3ζm with pHspB6 (33 μM of each respective to monomers; curve 5)
obtained under conditions described in . For comparison, the algebraic sum of 14-3-3ζm and HspB6 elution profiles is also added to the plot (dashed
curve 1 + 2). (B) SDS gel electrophoresis of fractions from the peak
of the complex formed by pHspB6 and 14-3-3ζm. Typical
result is shown. The positions of molecular mass standards (in kDa),
14-3-3 and HspB6 are indicated by arrows.

Thus, the monomeric mutant of 14-3-3ζ has
the same selectivity
and specificity as the dimeric 14-3-3ζ. It is unable to bind
unphosphorylated HspB6 or its S16D mutant and forms a tight complex
with phosphorylated HspB6. Interaction with 14-3-3ζm presumably induces dissociation of the HspB6 dimer as the stoichiometry
of the heterocomplex formed is close to 1:1.

Phosphorylated HspB6 Makes 14-3-3ζm Less Susceptible
to Proteolysis
It is possible that tight interaction between
14-3-3ζm and
phosphorylated HspB6 can affect structure of individual proteins within
the complex. In order to analyze the effect of phosphorylated HspB6
on 14-3-3ζm, we used several biophysical and biochemical
methods.

We first analyzed the effect of HspB6 on limited proteolysis
of 14-3-3ζ. Trypsinolysis of 14-3-3ζ leads to accumulation
of a major comparably stable peptide of ∼20 kDa,, which can interfere with the band of intact HspB6 having the same
apparent molecular weight on SDS–PAGE. Therefore, we used chymotrypsin
which produces only a minor 14-3-3-derived peptide with an apparent
molecular mass ∼20 kDa and two other major peptides with slightly
lower (∼17–18 kDa) and significantly higher (∼24
kDa) apparent molecular masses as compared with HspB6 (Figure A, 14-3-3ζm).

Limited chymotrypsinolysis
of 14-3-3ζ (A), HspB6 (B), and
their mixture (C). The samples, containing 14-3-3ζ (0.81 mg/mL),
HspB6 (0.52 mg/mL), or both proteins (indicated above each gel) were
incubated at 37 °C in the presence of TLCK-chymotrypsin at a
weight ratio protease/substrate of 1:1000 and analyzed by SDS–PAGE.
Time of incubation (in min) is indicated on the top of each lane.
Positions of molecular mass standards (in kDa), and positions of 14-3-3
and HspB6 are indicated by arrows. (D) Kinetics of the 14-3-3 band
degradation during chymotrypsinolysis of isolated 14-3-3ζm (open squares), isolated 14-3-3ζ WT (filled triangles),
or of the mixture of 14-3-3ζm with either unphosphorylated
(filled squares) or phosphorylated HspB6 (open circles). At represents 14-3-3 band intensity at
the time point t and A0 represents initial intensity.

In good agreement with the earlier data, we found that 14-3-3ζm is more
susceptible to proteolysis
than the wild type protein. For instance, even 90 min incubation of
the wild type protein with chymotrypsin was not accompanied by a significant
decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to the intact
14-3-3 (Figure A), whereas even a short 10
min incubation with chymotrypsin leads to significant disappearance
of the 14-3-3ζm band (Figure A). Peptide patterns observed after chymotrypsinolysis of both unphosphorylated
and phosphorylated HspB6 were very similar (Figure B); however, the rate of proteolysis of phosphorylated HspB6
was noticeably higher than that of the unphosphorylated protein (Figure B). If the mixture of 14-3-3ζm and
HspB6 was subjected to proteolysis, the pattern of accumulated peptides
was identical to the sum of patterns observed for two isolated proteins.
Addition of unphosphorylated HspB6 had no effect on the rate of 14-3-3ζm chymotrypsinolysis (Figure C, left).
On the contrary, when the 14-3-3ζm–pHspB6
complex was subjected to proteolysis, the rate of 14-3-3ζm degradation and concomitant accumulation of 14-3-3-derived
peptides of ∼24 and ∼17 kDa was significantly decreased
(compare left and right panels of Figure C,D).
The data presented indicate that interacting with 14-3-3ζm phosphorylated (but not unphosphorylated) HspB6 stabilizes
the 14-3-3ζm structure. At the same time the complex
formation does not affect the rate of pHspB6 proteolysis and as before
phosphorylated HspB6 was less stable than its unphosphorylated counterpart
(compare left and right panels on Figure B,C).
Since retardation of 14-3-3ζm proteolysis was observed
even after complete degradation of intact pHspB6, we can suppose that
stabilization of 14-3-3ζm is induced by short peptides
of HspB6 containing Ser16 in consensus sequence recognized
by 14-3-3.,

Which of pHspB6 Peptides Stabilize 14-3-3ζm?
To identify specific peptides of phosphorylated HspB6
that could stabilize 14-3-3ζm, we used MALDI/TOF
mass spectrometry and analyzed the composition of chymotryptic peptides
obtained after proteolysis of 14-3-3ζm alone or in
the presence of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated HspB6 (data not
shown). The main and the largest peptide of HspB6 also visible on
the gels on Figure B,C had the molecular mass
of 11450/11531 Da and corresponded to singly phosphorylated (∼80
Da) C-terminal peptide HspB6a.a.54–160. This peptide
of HspB6 contains a rather stable α-Crystallin domain. The next peptide having a molecular mass of
7180/7259 Da corresponded to a shorter HspB6a.a.54–117 fragment also containing a single phosphorylated site (∼80
Da). Mass prediction by massXpert indicated
that both phosphorylated peptides remaining resistant to proteolysis
derive from the C-terminal part of the molecule and contain Ser59. This site is only weakly phosphorylated by PKA and is not
phosphorylated by PKG, and the primary
structure at Ser59 (RAPS59VA) differs from the
consensus motifs recognized by 14-3-3. Moreover, prolonged incubation with chymotrypsin (90 min) results
in practically complete degradation of 11450/11531 peptide of phosphorylated
HspB6 with a significant portion of 14-3-3 remaining uncleaved (Figure C, right). At the same time even after long incubation
(90 min), a rather large portion of 11450/11531 peptide of unphosphorylated
HspB6 remained uncleaved, whereas the band of 14-3-3 was completely
vanished (Figure C, left). Therefore, it seems
very unlikely that the peptides containing weakly phosphorylated Ser59 bind to and stabilize 14-3-3ζm. Thus, the
major peptides of HspB6 visible on Figure B,C cannot account for 14-3-3ζm stabilization.

It is reasonable to suppose that the fragment of HspB6 containing
the major site phosphorylated by PKA, that is, Ser16, is
responsible for 14-3-3ζm stabilization. However,
secondary structure predictions () indicate that the N-terminus of HspB6 is unstructured and therefore
highly susceptible to proteolysis. In addition, this part of the molecule
contains many aromatic and hydrophobic residues (e.g., Trp11, Phe29, Phe33, Tyr53, Tyr54 shown on ) that could serve
as potential cleavage sites for chymotrypsin. Since the N-terminal
part of HspB6 is accessible to chymotrypsinolysis, even short incubation
with protease is accompanied by formation of very short peptides which
cannot be unequivocally detected on SDS–PAGE and determined
by mass-spectroscopy. Utilization of trypsin will lead to the same
situation as the flexible N-terminus of HspB6 contains many potential
sites for trypsin cleavage (e.g., Arg13, Arg14, Arg27, Arg32, Arg56, ), and this will again lead to accumulation
of short peptides. These features hamper unequivocal determination
of stabilizing peptide of HspB6.

The minimal 14-3-3-binding
fragment of pHspB6, RRApS16APL, does not contain
potential sites for
chymotrypsinolysis and would remain intact even under exhaustive digestion.
We suppose that all peptides derived from the N-terminus of phosphorylated
HspB6 and containing RRApS16APL fragment are able to interact
with 14-3-3ζm and retard its proteolysis. If this
suggestion is correct, the ligand-bound state of 14-3-3ζm is more stable to limited chymotrypsinolysis than its form
devoid of target peptides/proteins.

Effect of Phosphate on Chymotrypsinolysis of 14-3-3ζm
Inorganic phosphate can affect interaction of 14-3-3
with its ligands., We supposed that phosphate somehow
imitates interaction of 14-3-3 with its ligands and therefore can
affect chymotrypsinolysis of 14-3-3ζm. To check this
suggestion we performed 14-3-3ζm chymotrypsinolysis
in two buffers that had the same ionic strength and pH but differed
in chemical composition, that is, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 containing
115 mM NaCl (Figure A, left) and 50 mM Na/phosphate
pH 7.5 (Figure A, right). We varied ionic
strength and phosphate concentration; however, in all cases the presence
of phosphate led to a significantly reduced rate of 14-3-3ζm proteolysis (Figure A,C). This effect
was specific to 14-3-3ζm and could not be explained
by lower protease activity in phosphate buffer. Indeed, the rate of
chymotrypsinolysis of BSA was even slightly higher in phosphate than
in Tris buffer (Figure B,C). These results
agree with earlier observations indicating that phosphate might activate
chymotrypsin. However, phosphate inhibited
chymotrypsinolysis of 14-3-3ζm supporting our hypothesis
that binding of small molecules mimicking substrate makes 14-3-3ζm more stable. At the same time, this also means that it is
desirable to avoid utilization of phosphate buffers in any studies
analyzing interaction of 14-3-3 with phosphorylated partners since
phosphate can inhibit this interaction.

Effect of phosphate on
the limited chymotrypsinolysis of 14-3-3ζm. (A, B)
14-3-3ζm (0.81 mg/mL) or BSA (0.5
mg/mL) in two buffers differing only by the presence or absence of
phosphate was incubated at 37 °C with chymotrypsin at a weight
ratio protease/substrate equal to 1:1000 (14-3-3ζm) or 1:200 (BSA) for different times (indicated above each lane in
min). Protein composition of the samples was analyzed by SDS–PAGE.
Molecular mass standards (in kDa) and positions of 14-3-3 and BSA
are indicated by arrows. (C) Kinetics of the 14-3-3ζm or BSA band degradation determined by densitometry of the gels presented

Stabilization of 14-3-3ζm by pHspB6 Determined
by Far-UV CD Spectroscopy
It has been shown that the monomeric
mutant of 14-3-3ζ possesses the same α-helical structure
as the WT dimeric protein but is less thermostable. We supposed that phosphorylated HspB6 will affect not only
stability to proteolysis but also thermal stability of 14-3-3ζm. We used far-UV CD spectroscopy to monitor the changes in
the secondary structure of 14-3-3ζm upon heating.
Isolated HspB6 is enriched in β-structure and has a CD spectrum of low amplitude with a negative
maximum at ∼208 nm (see Figure A inset).
Phosphorylation of HspB6 by PKA slightly decreased the amplitude of
its CD spectrum (data not shown). In any case the amplitudes in the
CD spectra of HspB6 or pHspB6 were very small in comparison with the
α-helical 14-3-3 protein that has a pronounced negative maximum
at 222 nm (Figure A). Therefore, by measuring
ellipticity at 222 nm (Θ222), we were able to follow
temperature-induced changes in helicity of 14-3-3ζm independent of the presence of HspB6 in the sample.

Investigation of the
thermal stability of 14-3-3ζm by means of far-UV
CD spectroscopy. (A) Far-UV CD spectra of 14-3-3ζm (0.6 mg/mL; solid line) and HspB6 (0.4 mg/mL; dashed line
– main figure and inset). (B) Dependence of fraction of folded
14-3-3ζm alone (solid line) or in the complex with
pHspB6 (dashed line) on temperature. The samples were preincubated
for 30 min at 37 °C and heated from 20 to 70 °C at a constant
rate of 1 °C/min on Chirascan dichroism spectrometer (Applied
Biophysics). (C) The rate of 14-3-3ζm unfolding obtained
by differentiating the curves presented on panel B. The temperatures
characterizing the maximal unfolding rate of 14-3-3ζm with or without pHspB6 are presented in Table .

Upon heating the fraction of folded 14-3-3ζm was
gradually decreased and the protein became completely unfolded at
∼60 °C (Figure B,C). Addition
of pHspB6 induced decrease in the unfolding rate of 14-3-3ζm (at temperatures below ∼47 °C) and increased
cooperativity of the transition at the maximal unfolding rate (Figure B,C). The maximal rate of unfolding of isolated
14-3-3ζm was observed at 49.5 ± 0.3 °C,
whereas in the presence of phosphorylated HspB6 the maximal rate of
14-3-3ζm unfolding was detected at 53.0 ± 0.1
°C (Figure C, Table ). Thus, interaction
with pHspB6 increases thermal stability of 14-3-3ζm measured by CD spectroscopy.

Estimation of Thermal Stability of 14-3-3ζm–pHspB6 Complex by Trp Fluorescence
Fluorescence
spectroscopy was also used for analysis of the effect of pHspB6 on
thermal stability of 14-3-3ζm. Trp59 has
been shown to determine the intrinsic fluorescence of 14-3-3ζ. This tryptophan residue is located in the vicinity
to the ligand-binding groove of 14-3-3, and therefore its fluorescence
can be successfully used for following interaction of 14-3-3 with
its targets.

The only tryptophan residue of HspB6 (Trp11) is located at the N-terminus very close to the 14-3-3-binding motif
(see ). As already mentioned,
theoretical predictions indicate that the N-terminus of HspB6 is very
flexible and predominantly unordered. If these predictions are correct,
Trp11 will be exposed to the solvent and will have fluorescence
spectrum characteristic to Trp residues contacting with solvent and
belonging to the so-called class II of Trp in proteins according to
the classification of Burstein et al. Indeed, normalized fluorescence spectrum of HspB6 completely coincides
with the spectrum of class II Trp residues, and phosphorylation of
HspB6 by PKA does not change its fluorescence (, panel A). These data complement our conclusions
about flexibility and unstructured nature of the N-terminus of HspB6.

Our data indicated that heating up to ∼60 °C does not
dramatically affect Trp fluorescence of HspB6 (, panel B), and therefore the presence of HspB6 will
not interfere with 14-3-3s Trp fluorescence at least at temperatures
below 60 °C. We followed the thermally induced changes in the
14-3-3ζm fluorescence in the absence or presence
of phosphorylated HspB6 and determined corresponding half-transition
temperatures. Half-transition of isolated 14-3-3ζm occurred at 51.1 ± 0.2 °C (, Table ) in good agreement with
our earlier published data. Addition
of phosphorylated HspB6 induced increase of half-transition temperature
which became equal to 53.3 ± 0.1 °C (, Table ). Thus, both the
data of CD and fluorescence spectroscopy indicate that binding of
phosphorylated HspB6 increases thermal stability of 14-3-3ζm (Figure B,C, ).

Stabilization of 14-3-3ζm by pHspB6 Determined
by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
For more detailed
analysis of the thermal unfolding of 14-3-3ζm in
its complex with pHspB6, we applied differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), that is, the method commonly employed to study protein unfolding and protein–protein interaction. However, prior to DSC studies on the 14-3-3ζm–pHspB6 complex, it was necessary to analyze thermal
unfolding of isolated protein partners.

Figure A shows that the monomeric mutant of 14-3-3ζ is much
less thermostable than its dimeric counterpart. The thermal transition
of 14-3-3ζm was observed at 51.1 °C, that is,
at the temperature more than 10 °C less than the corresponding
transition of the 14-3-3ζ WT (Tm = 61.8 °C). Interestingly, similar low temperature transitions
(at 49.0–51.5 °C) were also observed on the DSC profile
of 14-3-3ζ with S58E mutation mimicking phosphorylation of 14-3-3ζ
occurring in vivo (). This mutation,
however, induced only partial dissociation of 14-3-3 dimers., Therefore, on these thermograms we observed two peaks, presumably
corresponding to 14-3-3 monomer (the low temperature peak) and dimer
(the high temperature peak on ). Thermal unfolding of 14-3-3ζm was fully irreversible
as it was accompanied by aggregation of the protein (Figure ; curve 1).

Thermal stability of 14-3-3ζm and HspB6 studied
by DSC. The samples containing 14-3-3ζm (A; solid
line) or 14-3-3ζ WT (A; dashed line) alone (0.9 mg/mL or 33
μM per monomer), HspB6 (B; solid line) or pHspB6 (B; dashed
line) alone (0.9 mg/mL or 50 μM per monomer), or the mixture
of 14-3-3ζm with HspB6 (C; solid line) or pHspB6
(C; dashed line) were heated from 5 to 80 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min
on a DASM-4 M differential scanning calorimeter and the excess heat
capacity (Cp) was measured
during the heating. The initial curves were processed as described
previously. The transition temperatures
(Tm) for proteins determined as maxima
of the peaks on thermograms are presented in Table .

Aggregation of 14-3-3ζm and HspB6 measured
by
light scattering. The samples, containing 14-3-3ζm (10 μM per monomer; curve 1), or HspB6 (10 μM per monomer;
curve 2), pHspB6 (10 μM per monomer; curve 3), or the mixture
of 14-3-3ζm with HspB6 (curve 4) or pHspB6 (curve
5) were heated from 15 to 80 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min and
the light scattering was simultaneously measured on a Cary Eclipse
spectrofluorometer as described in .

Figure B represents the
DSC profiles for
HspB6 and pHspB6. It is clearly seen that phosphorylation of HspB6
significantly increases the thermal stability of the protein by shifting
its thermal transition by almost 4 °C toward a higher temperature,
from 65.8 to 69.7 °C. It should be noted that the thermal denaturation
of HspB6 was fully irreversible as no cooperative transitions were
observed during reheating of the samples. In this respect, HspB6 is
quite different from the other members of the sHsp family (αB-Crystallin
(HspB5), HspB1, HspB8) whose thermal denaturation studied by DSC was
completely reversible.,, The irreversible nature of thermal denaturation of HspB6 seems to
be due to its temperature-induced aggregation (Figure ; curve 2), which also is not characteristic for the other
members of the sHsp family., It is noteworthy that
phosphorylation of HspB6 not only makes it more thermostable (Figure B), but also dramatically reduces its aggregation
measured by light scattering (Figure ; curve
3).

DSC profiles obtained for 14-3-3ζm in the
presence
of either HspB6 or pHspB6 are represented on Figure C. In accordance with our earlier published data and the data presented above (Figure ), the monomeric 14-3-3ζ can interact only
with phosphorylated HspB6, but not with unphosphorylated HspB6 or
its S16D mutant. DSC profile of the mixture of 14-3-3ζm with ∼1.5 molar excess of unphosphorylated HspB6 demonstrates
two peaks roughly corresponding to the peaks of isolated proteins
(Figure C; solid line). However, the peak
of 14-3-3ζm became slightly shifted toward higher
temperature and the area under the HspB6 thermal transition was significantly
(by ∼60%) decreased (Figure ; compare
solid lines on panel C and B). The above-mentioned minimal changes
of thermogram can be due to the interaction of unphosphorylated HspB6
(acting as chaperone) with 14-3-3ζm which becomes
unfolded in the course of heating. In favor of this assumption, the
light scattering data show that HspB6 and 14-3-3ζm mutually prevent temperature-induced aggregation of each other (Figure , compare curves 1, 2, and 4).

Phosphorylated
HspB6 induces much larger changes in thermogram
of 14-3-3ζm. For instance, thermal transition of
14-3-3ζm is shifted by ∼3 °C toward higher
temperature (Tm increases from 51.1 to
53.9 °C, Table ), and the area under
this transition is significantly increased (by ∼80% in comparison
with that in the case of unphosphorylated HspB6) (Figure C).

The following explanation can be proposed for the
DSC data. The
specific 14-3-3ζm–pHspB6 complex is stabilized
by noncovalent bonds between two proteins; hence, dissociation of
this complex is accompanied by disruption of these bonds that will
have an endothermic effect. This is reflected in a significant increase
of Tm and calorimetric enthalpy (the area)
of the 14-3-3ζm thermal transition. This effect is
observed only in the case of phosphorylated HspB6. Unphosphorylated
HspB6 weakly and nonspecifically interacts with 14-3-3ζm, and therefore its effect at low temperatures is negligible.
Further increase of temperature is accompanied by dissociation of
both specific and nonspecific complexes of 14-3-3ζm with HspB6. Dissociated 14-3-3ζm becomes unfolded
and aggregates. Both HspB6 and pHspB6 possess chaperone-like activity
and inhibit 14-3-3ζm aggregation. Therefore after
14-3-3ζm denaturation (above 60 °C) the temperature
dependence of light scattering for 14-3-3ζm–pHspB6
complex is very similar to that of the mixture of 14-3-3ζm with unphosphorylated HspB6 (Figure , curves 4 and 5).

Prevention of Myosin S1 Aggregation by 14-3-3ζ
As mentioned earlier, monomeric 14-3-3ζ retains substrate-binding
site and is able to interact with certain protein targets with affinity
comparable or even higher than the WT dimeric 14-3-3. It is also possible that monomeric 14-3-3 will acquire
some new properties because a rather large area buried in the dimer
interface becomes exposed upon dimer dissociation. It has been reported that 14-3-3 possesses its own chaperone-like
activity and is able to prevent aggregation of partially denatured
proteins.− Therefore, we investigated the ability of different forms of 14-3-3ζ
to prevent aggregation of myosin subfragment 1 (S1) as a model substrate
which was earlier successfully used for analysis of protein aggregation and chaperone-like activity of HspB1 (Hsp27). Incubation of S1 at the heat shock temperature
(43 °C) causes its aggregation, easily detectable by spectroscopic
techniques. S1 was incubated at elevated temperature and the effect
of 14-3-3ζm or dimeric 14-3-3ζ WT on the kinetics
of S1 aggregation was monitored by measuring optical density at 360
nm. Both forms of 14-3-3ζ suppressed aggregation and formation
of flocculated amorphous aggregates of S1 in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure ). At all tested weight ratios
S1:14-3-3ζ (in the range of 1:0.1–1:1), the 14-3-3 monomer
was much more effective than its dimeric counterpart (Figure A–D). For instance, at the weight ratio S1/14-3-3ζ
equal to 1:1 monomeric 14-3-3 almost completely prevented temperature-induced
aggregation of S1, whereas dimeric 14-3-3 only slightly retarded aggregation
of S1 (Figure D).

Prevention of the myosin
S1 aggregation by 14-3-3ζm, 14-3-3ζ WT, and
HspB6. S1 aggregation initiated by incubation
at the heat shock temperature (43 °C) was monitored by measuring
optical density at 360 nm on a Cary 100 UV–visible spectrophotometer.
(A–D) Aggregation of S1 alone (0.46 mg/mL; curve 1) or in the
presence of 14-3-3ζ WT (curve 2) or 14-3-3ζm (curve 3) at different S1/14-3-3 weight ratios which are indicated
on each panel. Curve 0 demonstrates that under conditions of the experiment
14-3-3ζm (as well as 14-3-3ζ WT and HspB6)
does not aggregate. (E) Comparison of the chaperone-like activities
of pHspB6 (curve 2), HspB6 (curve 3), 14-3-3ζ WT (curve 4),
and 14-3-3ζm (curve 5) at a S1/chaperone weight ratio
equal to 1:0.55. Curve 1 represents control aggregation of S1.

We also compared chaperone-like activity of HspB6
and 14-3-3ζ.
Under conditions used the dimeric 14-3-3ζ WT and phosphorylated
HspB6 possessed roughly equal moderate chaperone-like activity and
equally decelerated aggregation of S1 (Figure E, curves 2 and 4). At the same time unphosphorylated HspB6 and,
especially, monomeric 14-3-3ζm possessed a much higher
chaperone-like activity and their effect on S1 aggregation was substantially
more pronounced (Figure E, curves 3 and 5).

Discussion
In the cell 14-3-3 proteins are predominantly
present in the form
of stable homo- or heterodimers. However,
it is reasonable to assume that dimers can be formed only by specific
interaction of corresponding monomers which are transiently accumulated
in the cell after protein biosynthesis and can participate in subunit
exchange. Interestingly, it was shown that specific protein substrates
might induce subunit exchange within 14-3-3 dimers leading to formation
of selected heterodimers presumably via a substrate-bound monomeric
14-3-3. Recently published data indicate
that certain cells can have a splicing isoform of 14-3-3 that is unable
to form stable dimers. Moreover, posttranslational
modifications (such as phosphorylation of Ser58) can induce
dissociation of 14-3-3, and therefore
certain signals can lead to accumulation of monomers. Thus, under
certain conditions the monomeric molecules of 14-3-3 would be present
in the cell. However, up to now the structure, properties, and fate
of 14-3-3 monomers remain poorly understood. Pilot investigations
concerning monomers of 14-3-3,,, were made at a cellular level
using extensively mutated proteins with poorly characterized structure.
In the previous study, we characterized physicochemical properties
of the monomeric form of 14-3-3ζ containing minimal number of
mutations. Here, we analyze properties
of the monomeric 14-3-3 and investigate the effect of phosphorylated
target protein bound to 14-3-3 on its stability.

Earlier, it
was shown that the dimeric 14-3-3γ interacts
with phosphorylated HspB6 but is unable to form tight complexes with
unphosphorylated HspB6 or its phosphomimicking mutant, S16D. Here, by using AF4-MALLS we found that the monomeric
14-3-3ζ also does not interact either with unphosphorylated
HspB6 or its phosphomimicking mutant S16D. At the same time the dimer-deficient
mutant of 14-3-3 forms stable complexes with the phosphorylated HspB6,
with the apparent total molecular mass of 45.0 ± 1.0 kDa. This
molecular mass corresponds well with molecular mass expected for a
1:1 complex formed by a monomer of 14-3-3 and monomer of phosphorylated
HspB6 (Figure  and ). These data are in good agreement with our earlier results and indicate that both monomeric and dimeric
14-3-3 tightly interact with phosphorylated HspB6. Formation of this
complex is accompanied by dissociation of the usually rather stable
dimers of HspB6.

Pseudophosphorylation of HspB6 (Ser16Asp substitution)
appears
to be insufficient for 14-3-3 binding as only the phosphorylated HspB6
forms stable complexes with monomeric and dimeric 14-3-3. Likewise,
the necessity of phosphorylation and an inadequacy of phosphomimicking
mutation was previous reported for interaction of 14-3-3 with human
keratin 18. On the other hand, Asp/Glu
mutant of synaptopodin was able to bind
14-3-3 similarly to phosphorylated protein supporting the suggestion
that both the primary structure and environment of phosphorylated
Ser/Thr (or Asp and Glu mimicking the site of phosphorylation) are
important for recognition of target proteins by 14-3-3.

Interaction
of monomeric or dimeric 14-3-3 with pHspB6 might be
important for cardioprotective action of HspB6 and its regulation
of smooth muscle contraction. Both activities strongly correlate with
phosphorylation of HspB6 at Ser16 by cyclic nucleotide-dependent
protein kinases;,, however, the molecular mechanism of these activities remains obscure.
We speculate that when present at a relatively high concentration,
phosphorylated HspB6 can displace certain enzymes (protein kinases,
phosphatases, etc.) or other factors from their complexes with 14-3-3
(discussed in ref ()). It is possible that proteins released during this process participate
in cardioprotection and/or regulation of smooth muscle contraction.

Monomeric 14-3-3 is significantly less stable to limited proteolysis
than its dimeric counterpart (ref () and Figure A). This
can be due to unmasking of certain sites buried at the subunit interface
or due to the overall destabilization of the structure. Addition of
phosphorylated HspB6 significantly retarded proteolytic degradation
of the monomeric 14-3-3 (Figure C) and in
the presence of phosphorylated HspB6 the rate of 14-3-3ζm degradation became comparable with that of the dimeric 14-3-3
(Figure D).

Ser16 of HspB6
is the main site effectively phosphorylated
by the cyclic-nucleotide dependent protein kinases. Moreover, Ser16 is located in the sequence RRApS16APL exactly corresponding to the consensus motif recognized
by 14-3-3. Therefore the N-terminal tail of HspB6 appears to be important
for interaction with 14-3-3. This region
of the small heat shock proteins is very mobile and flexible. This
property of the structure can at least partially explain why all attempts
to crystallize the full-length human small heat shock proteins were
so far unsuccessful. Recently published data provide important information
on the structure of α-crystallin domain of small heat shock
proteins, with only preliminary data being available
on structure and location of the N-terminal segment. The absence of accurate structural information complicates
a detailed analysis of the HspB6 and 14-3-3 interaction. In addition,
certain peculiarity of the primary structure of HspB6 hampers accurate
identification of peptides responsible for stabilization of the monomeric
14-3-3ζ. However, the limited proteolysis data indicate that
even rather short phosphorylated fragments of HspB6 derived from its
N-terminal segment make 14-3-3ζm more stable to proteolysis.
We observed similar stabilization upon addition of inorganic phosphate
(Figure ), that is supposed to occupy phosphopeptide-binding
pocket of 14-3-3. The data presented mean that ligand binding stabilizes
the structure of 14-3-3ζm.

Since binding of
phosphorylated HspB6 affected susceptibility of
14-3-3ζm to proteolysis, we supposed that formation
of the complex can affect the stability of individual proteins. By
using different spectroscopic methods we found that addition of phosphorylated
HspB6 increased the temperature of 14-3-3ζm unfolding,
as measured by far-UV CD spectroscopy (Figure ), and increased half-transition temperature measured by fluorescent
spectroscopy (, Table ). Thus, after binding of the phosphorylated HspB6,
the 14-3-3ζm molecule became more resistant to temperature-induced
unfolding.

The stabilizing effect of HspB6 on the 14-3-3ζm structure was further analyzed by means of DSC and light
scattering
(Figures  and ). We
found that phosphorylated HspB6 shifted the thermal transition of
14-3-3ζm and significantly increased the enthalpy
of this transition (Figure C, Table ). This effect appears to be due to multisite specific
interactions between the two proteins. In the case of unphosphorylated
HspB6, we did not observe such specific interaction, and any effect
of HspB6 could be explained by its nonspecific chaperone-like action.

Chaperone-like activity of 14-3-3 was first observed in 1996, when
14-3-3 solubilized ubiquitin-editing zinc finger enzyme A20, altering
its cellular localization. Further, it
was found that 14-3-3 can act as a conventional chaperone preventing
aggregation of protein substrates, or even by
dissolving preformed aggregates. It is
thought that 14-3-3 predominantly interacts with proteins containing
intrinsically disordered regions. Among
these proteins there are many proteins tending to aggregate and 14-3-3
is thought to prevent their aggregation. However, insufficient concentration
of 14-3-3 induces aggregation leading to formation of inclusion bodies., Chaperone-like activity of 14-3-3 is substrate-dependent: it can
either prevent or promote aggregation of analyzed proteins or have
no effect.,

By using subfragment 1 of rabbit skeletal
muscle myosin as a model
substrate, we found that 14-3-3ζm was more effective
than the dimeric WT protein in preventing temperature-induced aggregation
(Figure ). Moreover, the chaperone-like effect
of 14-3-3ζm was no less than that of the unphosphorylated
HspB6 and significantly stronger than that of the phosphorylated HspB6
(Figure E). The mechanism of chaperone-like
action of 14-3-3 remains elusive. However,
it is generally supposed that chaperones predominantly recognize and
bind misfolded hydrophobic regions on the surface of target proteins.
Monomerization of 14-3-3 is accompanied by exposure of a number of
hydrophobic residues that are normally buried in the subunit interface
(), and therefore it is not surprising that 14-3-3ζm possesses higher chaperone-like activity than the wild type dimeric
14-3-3ζ. We suggest that in vivo the chaperone action of 14-3-3
might be dependent on the monomeric form of the protein and can be
regulated by the monomer/dimer equilibrium.

To summarize, we
conclude that the monomeric 14-3-3 retains certain
properties of its dimeric counterpart. The monomeric 14-3-3ζm is significantly less stable than the dimeric 14-3-3ζ.
However, the stability of the 14-3-3ζm can be at
least partially recovered by its interaction with target proteins.
In addition, due to the exposure of residues that are normally buried
in the dimer interface, the monomeric 14-3-3 has different properties
and possesses higher chaperone-like activity than the dimeric protein.
