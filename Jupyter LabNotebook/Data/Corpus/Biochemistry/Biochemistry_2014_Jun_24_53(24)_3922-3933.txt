The Gram-positive
bacterium
and opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus causes skin and life-threatening systemic infections in mammals. Critical to S. aureus growth, survival, and virulence is its ability to capture iron from
its host. In mammals, the largest repository
of iron is present in complex with protoporphyrin (heme) in hemoglobin
(Hb). To capture and assimilate this heme-bound iron form, S. aureus has specifically optimized a series of
nine iron-regulated surface determinant (Isd) proteins, denoted IsdA
through IsdI.

Heme capture from Hb is accomplished by IsdB and
IsdH that are
anchored at the cell surface of S. aureus. IsdB preferentially captures heme from Hb, whereas IsdH can capture
heme from both Hb and the Hb-Haptoglobin complex., The
acquired heme is subsequently transferred through the cell wall via
a relay system of proteins exhibiting different affinities for heme
and involves heme transfer from IsdB to IsdA and IsdC, which in turn
relay heme to IsdE, the lipoprotein component of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter IsdEDF., From there, heme is
transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by action of this ABC
transporter system and oxidized in the cytoplasm by IsdG and IsdI
to release iron from heme for cellular use in S. aureus.,,

The Hb receptors
IsdB and IsdH are comprised of two and three NEAr
transporter (NEAT) domains, respectively,, which
enable them to rapidly acquire heme from Hb. The structurally conserved
NEAT domain is comprised of ∼120 amino acids and adopts a characteristic
immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold.− The single NEAT domains of IsdA and IsdC, and the C-terminal NEAT
domains of IsdB and IsdH have been shown to bind heme,− and are comprised of a hydrophobic heme-binding site which envelops
the heme within the proteins by a 6-stranded antiparallel β-sheet
on one side and a short α-helix of the other side. A conserved YXXXY motif in the heme binding
pocket of these NEAT domains, where one tyrosine binds the iron and
the other tyrosine is involved in hydrogen-bonding to the axial tyrosine,
appears to be key for heme binding, as other NEAT domains lacking
this motif do not bind heme.− However, in the crystal structure of IsdB-N2, two
axial ligands consisting of a conserved tyrosine (Y440) and methionine
(M362) coordinate heme in the protein heme binding pocket. The Met-Tyr axial coordination of IsdB-N2 is
unique in heme iron binding proteins. The conserved Y440 is important
for heme binding, but M362 is necessary for heme transfer to IsdA.
The unique iron coordination of IsdB is predicted to be important
for its unique role as a Hb receptor and initiator of heme import
by the Isd pathway.

However, the
NEAT domains have evolved different functions, even
within the same protein: IsdB and IsdH are modular proteins that include
multiple NEAT domains, two and three, respectively, and their N-terminal
NEAT domains, IsdB-N1, IsdH-N1, and IsdH-N2, do not bind heme and
are instead involved in protein–protein interactions.,

Recent studies have shown that inactivation of the isdB gene, but not isdH, significantly
decreases hemoglobin
binding and impairs the ability of S. aureus to utilize hemoglobin as an iron source. Furthermore, specific mutations within IsdB Hb-binding domain resulted
in a significant reduction in virulence of S. aureus variants. Thus, IsdB appears to be
the predominant Hb-binding receptor for heme acquisition by S. aureus.

IsdB is comprised of five protein
segments: NEAT1 (residues 145–270,
IsdBN1), NEAT 2 (residues 338–458, IsdBN2), a linker region between N1 and N2 (residues 271–337), an
N-terminal segment (residues 40 to 144), and a C-terminal segment
(residues 459–613). The N-terminal region contains a secretion
signal motif (residues 1–39) for protein translocation to the
cell wall, and the C-terminal segment contains a C-terminal membrane-anchoring
LPXTG motif and a highly charged C-terminal residue stretch (residues
614–643), enabling protein anchoring to the cell wall via sortase
A activity. IsdBN2 is the heme-binding
domain of IsdB, while the N-terminal
segment and IsdBN1 are required for the rapid kinetics
of the methemoglobin (metHb)/IsdB reaction (ref () and Zhu et al., manuscript
under review)). IsdB linker region between N1 and N2 drives the equilibrium
of the metHb/IsdB reaction, whereas IsdB’s C-terminal segment
is not directly involved in the heme assimilation reaction (Zhu et
al., manuscript under review). These data strongly suggest that, except
for the IsdB’s C-terminal region, all other protein segments
of IsdB are necessary and act in concert for rapid and efficient heme
capture from metHb.

Initial studies demonstrated that IsdB N1-linker-N2
(residues 145–458)
acquires heme from metHb slowly in a reaction that reaches almost
full transfer upon equilibrium (Zhu et al., manuscript under review).
We found that addition of amino acids 125–144 to an IsdB N1-linker-N2
protein fragment stabilizes the protein construct while resulting
in a comparable rate of heme transfer from metHb (Zhu et al., manuscript
under review). This indicates that the region encompassing amino acids
125–144, while not critical for the rapid kinetics of the metHb/IsdB
reaction, may play an important structural role for IsdB. In the present
study, IsdBN1 is thus denoted as the protein fragment spanning
amino acid residues 125–272. To initiate detailed structural
studies of IsdB and to identify key residues interacting with metHb,
we have solved the three-dimensional (3D) structure of IsdBN1 in solution. We investigated which residues of IsdBN1 are important mediators of IsdBN1:metHb protein–protein
interactions using 2D 1H–15N correlation
HSQC NMR experiments and by monitoring amide 1H/15N chemical shift changes. Potentially crucial residues of IsdBN1 identified from NMR were further investigated using site-directed
mutagenesis and in vitro heme transfer experiments.
Results from these studies indicate that F164, and to a lesser extent
Y167, of IsdB are important mediators of IsdBN1/metHb interactions
and play a key role in the rapid kinetics of heme transfer from metHb
to IsdB. Taken together, our findings provide a structural and biochemical
basis for the role of IsdBN1 in enhancing the rate of extraction
of metHb heme by the IsdB N2 domain.

Experimental Procedures
DNA Cloning,
Protein Expression, and Purification of IsdBN1 and IsdBN1 Variants
DNA cloning of IsdB
NEAT 1 domain (IsdBN1) encompassing residues Leu125 to
Asp272 of IsdB was accomplished as previously described. DNA constructs encoding IsdB amino acid stretches
Leu125–Asn458 (referred to as IsdBN1-L-N2), Leu125–Asn339 (IsdBN1-L), Glu271–Asn458
(IsdBL-N2), Glu304–Asn458 (IsdB35LN2), Lys319–Asn458 (IsdB20LN2), and Asn339–Asn458
(IsdBN2) were amplified using PCR from a pET-21d plasmid
containing the isdb gene encoding residues 40–613
of IsdB as described in ref (). DNA cloning of IsdH NEAT1 (IsdHN1, residues
Ala86-Leu229) and NEAT2 (IsdHN2, residues Gln321-Asn464)
was amplified by PCR from S. aureus strain ATCC 6538 genomic DNA. The PCR products were ligated into
pET-46 Ek/LIC (Novagen) plasmid. pET46-DNA vectors encoding IsdBN1-F164D, IsdBN1-Y167D, IsdBN1LN2-F164D,
IsdBN1LN2-F164A, IsdBN1LN2-Y167D, and IsdBN1LN2-F164D/Y167D protein variants were generated using the
QuikChange Lightening (Agilent Technologies) site directed mutagenesis
kit using wild type IsdBN1-pET46 or IsdBN1-L-N2-pET46 vector as the starting template. All constructs were confirmed
by Sanger sequencing and include the amino acids MAHHHHHHVDDDDKM
added to the N-terminus of the IsdB protein sequences.

Protein
expression was carried out as in Fonner et al. To produce unlabeled proteins, Escherichia
coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with plasmids containing isdB fragments were grown in LB medium to an OD600 nm reading of 0.6, upon which 1 mM IPTG was added to induce protein
expression, and cells were grown for an additional 6 h. To produce
uniformly 15N or 15N/13C-labeled
IsdB proteins, BL21(DE3) E. coli cells
transformed with the respective IsdB pET46 plasmids were grown in
M9 minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl (1.5
g/L), or 15NH4Cl and 13C-labeled-glucose
(3.0 g/L) (Cambridge Isotopes) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources,
respectively. Cells were grown to an OD600 nm reading
of 0.6, upon which 1 mM IPTG was added to induce 15N or 15N/13C labeled protein expression, and cells grown
for an additional 10 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
4000g for 15 min, and resulting cell pellets stored
at −20 °C until further use. Cells were thawed and resuspended
in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8) with
freshly prepared 0.1 mM PMSF and lysed using an M-110L microfluidizer
instrument (Microfluidics). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation
at 12 000g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the
supernatant applied to a nickel affinity chromatography column containing
5 mL bed volume of HisPur Ni-NTA Resin (Thermo Scientific). The column
was washed with 2× the bed volume of lysis buffer and eluted
with the same buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Protein-containing
fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH
8.0. Protein concentration was established by measuring the absorbance
at 280 nm (OD280 nm) and an extinction coefficient
ε of 18 910 M–1 cm–1, protein purity assessed by SDS-PAGE, and protein molecular mass
confirmed with mass spectrometry using MS instruments of the Proteomics
and Metabolomics Mass Spectrometry Facility of Montana State University.

NMR Spectroscopy
Multidimensional (2D and 3D) heteronuclear
(1H, 15N, 13C) NMR spectra were recorded
on a 1 mM IsdBN1 protein solution containing 50 mM sodium
phosphate, 400 mM sodium chloride, 1.0 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 0.01%
sodium azide, at pH 6.8, in either 95% H2O/5% D2O or 100% D2O (for acquisition of 3D 13C-edited 1H–1H TOCSY and 13C-edited 1H–1H-NOESY NMR spectra) on a four-channel
Bruker AVANCE III 600 spectrometer equipped with a TCI NMR cryoprobe
at 298 K (25 °C). Extracted backbone and side chain resonance
assignments are reported in ref () and have been deposited in the BMRB as entry
19056. For hydrogen/deuterium (1H/2H) solvent
exchange experiments, 500 μL of a 1 mM 15N-labeled-IsdBN1 solution previously lyophilized was resuspended in 500 μL
of 100% D2O and 2D 1H–15N
correlation HSQC spectra collected at
subsequent times. To ensure that the IsdBN1 protein was
unaffected by the lyophilization process, a control experiment was
performed whereby another protein sample was lyophilized and resuspended
in H2O. The resulting 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC NMR spectrum was identical to that of unlyophilized 15N-labeled IsdBN1. In addition, 2D CLEANEX-PM NMR
experiments were performed to identify
amide hydrogens undergoing fast chemical exchange with solvent. All
data were processed and analyzed with NMRPipe and Sparky software.

NMR Protein
Structure Calculations
Interproton NOE
assignments were determined from analysis of 3D 15N-edited 1H–1H NOESY (NOE mixing period τm = 100 ms) and 3D 13C-edited 1H–1H NOESY (τm = 100 ms) spectra. Assignments
of NOE resonances were performed using a combination of manual inspection
and automated NOE assignment using the UNIO’10 Version 2.0.2
software., Hydrogen bond restraints were identified
from NH signals protected from 1H/2H solvent
exchange. Backbone Φ and Ψ dihedral angles constraints
were derived from 1Hα, 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shift
data using the program TALOS+. For the
final set of protein structure calculations, 200 structures of IsdBN1 were generated with CYANA 2.1 using CYANA’s standard
simulated annealing protocol, and 40 structures with
the lowest residual target functions were selected for water refinement
in AMBER9 using the AMPS-NMR web portal and a standard restrained molecular dynamics
protocol implemented within the AMBER99SB force field, a generalized
Born model, and a 10 Å TIP3P water box. From the set of 40 structures, 20 IsdBN1 structures with
lowest conformational energy and no experimental distance and dihedral
angle constraints violations greater than 0.5 Å or 5°, respectively,
were selected to generate a final ensemble of low conformational energy
IsdBN1 protein structures. The overall quality of each
IsdBN1 structure was assessed using PROCHECK-NMR, MolProbity, Verify3D, and the protein structure validation suite (PSVS)
software. The 20 conformers of IsdBN1 have been deposited in the protein data bank as PDB ID code 2MOQ. Protein structure
figures were prepared using the PYMOL graphics program. Structural homology was identified with the
DALI server, and the structural superposition
of Isd protein structural homologues was accomplished using the SSM
superposition module of the Coot software.

Size-Exclusion Chromatography
MetHb and Isd proteins
singly or as a 1:6 molar mixture (metHb (20 μM), subunit molecular
weight of 16 125 Da and Isd protein (120 μM)) were equilibrated
in 20 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7 buffer at
room temperature for 30 min. A 50 μL aliquot of the sample was
loaded onto a high-performance size exclusion column, Superdex 75
(1 × 30 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer at a flow rate of
0.4 mL/min and ambient temperature. Each chromatogram was recorded
using wavelengths of 230, 280, and 406 nm. To specifically display
the elution profile of metHb, only 406 nm chromatograms are shown
in Figure . To calculate the change in molecular
mass for each complex, the elution volume was compared to a standard
curve generated from known proteins eluted under the same conditions.

NMR Studies of metHb Binding to IsdBN1
Binding
of IsdBN1 to methemoglobin (metHb) was investigated using
2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC NMR experiments recorded at 298 K. Freshly purified 15N-labeled IsdBN1 protein was dialyzed into NMR
buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 100 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM EDTA,
0.1 mM PMSF, 0.01% sodium azide at pH 6.8) to which 5% (v/v) D2O was added, and the solution concentrated to 0.5 mM final
protein concentration. A metHb stock solution was prepared by dissolving
8 mg of lyophilized human metHb (Sigma) in 10 mL of NMR buffer followed
by dialysis against 2 × 1 L NMR buffer. The solution was concentrated
using a 10 kDa (MWCO) centrifugal spin concentrator to a protein concentration
of 0.5 mM (αβ dimer, MW 32 000). Production of
metHb:IsdBN1 NMR samples was accomplished by mixing 500
μL of the 0.5 mM human metHb stock solution with 0–1500
μL of the 0.5 mM 15N-labeled IsdBN1 stock
solution. The resulting protein mixtures were concentrated back to
a 500 μL volume, equilibrated for 30 min, and then analyzed
by NMR. 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC spectra
were recorded at metHb:IsdBN1 protein ratios of 1:0.5,
1:0.75, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, and 1:3. Competition experiments were carried
out by adding progressive amounts of non-isotopically labeled IsdBN1 (0.25–1.35 mM) to a 0.5 mM equal molar metHb:15N-IsdBN1 sample solution, followed by the recording
of resulting 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC
spectra. Hb binding studies of IsdBN1 variants as monitored
by 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC NMR experiments
were conducted in a similar manner.

Preparation of Apo-IsdB
Proteins for Heme Transfer Experiments
Apo-IsdB proteins,
used in in vitro heme transfer
experiments, were prepared using the methyl ethyl ketone heme extraction
method as reported in ref (). Briefly, a 5 mL aliquot of a 0.2 mg/mL IsdB protein solution
dissolved in 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8, was adjusted to a pH of 2.8 using
a 6 M HCl stock solution, to which an equal volume (5 mL) of methyl
ethyl ketone was added and the resulting mixture vortexed. Following
separation of the organic and aqueous phases, the aqueous phase was
collected and dialyzed against 4 L of water overnight in two 2 L steps.
The resulting protein solution was subsequently dialyzed into 20 mM
sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.5 buffer.

Spectroscopic
Measurement of Heme Transfer
Rates of
heme transfer from metHb to IsdBN1-L-N2 and other N1/N2
containing IsdB protein constructs were measured using a conventional
UV/vis spectrometer (Thermo Evolution 60s) at 25 °C by monitoring
spectral changes of the Soret absorption band at 406 nm as described
in ref (). Briefly,
4 μM holo-metHb (Sigma) was rapidly mixed with 25 μM apo-IsdB
protein in 20 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.5
buffer, and changes in absorbance at 406 nm were monitored for 30
min. Each reaction was repeated in triplicate. The data was plotted
and analyzed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software
Inc.), and all reactions were fit to a single exponential decay function
to extract heme transfer rates and kinetic parameters.

Results
Three-Dimensional
Solution Structure of IsdBN1
NMR assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone and side-chain
atom resonances were accomplished using
standard multidimensional (1H, 15N, 13C) experiments as a first step toward solving the 3D structure of
the first NEAT domain of IsdB (IsdBN1) in solution. The
resulting chemical shifts have been deposited as BMRB entry 19056. A total of 1535 1H–1H NOEs were identified from analysis of 3D 15N- and 13C-edited 1H–1H-NOESY spectra.
Of these, 825 sequential and long-range NOE together with 277 dihedral
angle and 92 hydrogen-bond distance restraints were used for the final
IsdBN1 structure calculations (Table ). As mentioned, a structural ensemble of low conformational energy
IsdBN1 conformers was determined using a standard simulated
annealing protocol of CYANA 2.1 followed by “water refinement”
of selected conformers using the program AMBER9. An overlay of 20
conformers of IsdBN1 with the lowest residual CYANA target
function value, and no NOE or dihedral angle violations greater than
0.5 Å or 5°, respectively, is shown in Figure . The ensemble of IsdBN1 structures demonstrates
that IsdBN1 adopts a well-ordered structure spanning residues
124–264, with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for the final
set of IsdBN1 structures relative to a calculated mean
structure of 0.65 Å for backbone atoms of residues 129–134,
147–150, 153–157, 174–178, 183–189, 196–202,
205–207, 210–215, 219–227, 233–242, and
245–256, corresponding to IsdBN1 well-defined secondary
structural elements α1, β1a, β1b, β2, β3,
β4, β5a, β5b, β6, β7, and β8,
respectively (see Figure ). The C-terminal
segment of the protein (residues 265–271) is disordered, as
evidenced by the lack of short- and long-range 1H–1H NOEs and the presence of amide hydrogens undergoing fast 1H/2H solvent exchange. Largest RMSDs apart from
the N- and C-termini of the protein are observed for backbone atoms
located in loop regions of IsdBN1, including loop 2 spanning
residues 158–172 and labeled L2 in Figure . This loop interconnects β-strands β1b and β2,
and is comprised of a stretch of aromatic amino acids (F164–Y165–H166–Y167)
whose 1H/15N amide NMR resonances were unobservable
in the 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of 15N or 15N/13C IsdBN1 samples,
thus precluding assignment of sequential or short-range NOEs for this
region of the protein.

of aromatic amino acid residues F164, Y165, H166, and Y167 that comprise
the aromatic motif of loop 2 (L2) are shown as stick models.

Overall, the IsdBN1 structure adopts a characteristic
immunoglobin (Ig) β-sandwich-like-fold that is comprised of
two antiparallel five-stranded β-sheets similar but not identical
to the architecture of other NEAT domains− (see Figure ). The first
five-stranded β-sheet of IsdBN1 is comprised of β-strands
β1a-β2-β3-β6-β5b, and the second β-sheet
incorporates β-strands β1b-β4-β7-β8-β5a.
IsdBN1’s Ig fold differs from a prototypical Ig
structural motif in that each β-sheet is comprised of five extended
antiparallel β-strands as compared to four in the canonical
Ig structural fold. In addition, a short α-helical structural
element spanning residues 129–134 followed by a long loop (L1)
spanning residues 135–146 initiates the 3D fold of IsdBN1. This structural feature is not typically seen in other
heme-binding NEAT domains but seems characteristic of hemoglobin binding
NEAT domains.,,,

As anticipated, since IsdBN1 is closely related to the
hemoglobin (Hb)/haptoglobin (Hp) IsdH receptor, structural alignment
of IsdBN1 using the DALI software identified two closely related structural homologues, IsdHN1 and IsdHN2, two of the three NEAT domains of IsdH that
participate in Hb- but not in heme-binding,, (IsdHN1 PDB entry 2H3K, 2.1 Å RMSD
over 139 aligned residues with 43% sequence identity, and IsdHN2 PDB entry 4IJ2, 2.0 Å RMSD over 133 aligned residues with 65% identity, respectively).

A structural overlay and sequence alignment of the NEAT motif of
IsdBN1 with IsdHN1, IsdHN2, and IsdA
is shown in Figure A and B, respectively.
Comparison of IsdBN1 with IsdHN1 reveals that
the structures are quite similar for core residues with both comprised
of a disordered L2 loop when uncomplexed with metHb. For IsdHN1 and IsdHN2, this disordered
loop becomes ordered and forms a short α-helix upon binding
to metHb, as observed in the crystal structures of these two NEAT
domains of IsdH in complex with metHb.,, In contrast, NEAT domains that bind heme such as
IsdAN have a comparable solvent exposed region, but the
latter is devoid of a stretch of aromatic amino acids and adopts a
well-folded α-helical structure in the absence of heme bound
ligand. Such a structural arrangement
appears to be critical to form a well-defined heme-binding pocket
of the IsdAN protein. The
L2 region (or equivalent) of S. aureus NEAT domains thus appears to be highly adaptable to the specific
functions imparted onto NEAT domain structural folds.

3D structure of IsdBN1 (blue)
with that of other NEAT domain containing proteins: IsdHN1 (green, PDB entry 2H3K), IsdHN2 (cyan, PDB entry 4FC3), and IsdAN (light brown,
PDB entry 3QZN) with secondary structural elements and L2 labeled. (B) ClustalW

and aromatic amino acids that were substituted by aspartic acids within
IsdBN1 sequence denoted by an asterisk (∗) above
their one-letter code. The location of IsdBN1 secondary
structural elements is shown above the sequence.

Another notable difference between Hb-binding NEAT domains
such
as IsdBN1 and NEAT domains specialized to bind heme is
the presence of a short N-terminal α-helix followed by an extended
loop (L1) which together wrap around the first five-stranded antiparallel
β-sheet of IsdBN1’s Ig-like fold. While this
region seems specific to Hb-binding NEAT domains, it is unclear if
residues within L1 directly interact with Hb, at least based on examination
of reported crystal structures of IsdHN1/IsdHN2-metHb complexes., Our structural study of IsdBN1, however, indicates that this L1 region is important for
the overall global fold and structural stability of IsdBN1, as initial investigations of an IsdBN1 protein construct
spanning only residues 140–270 revealed that the latter was
poorly soluble and expressed in insoluble inclusion bodies of E. coli (data not shown). The 3D structure of IsdBN1 reveals the presence of three hydrophobic amino acids (Leu129,
Ile133, and Ile138) that participate in important van der Waals contacts
with amino acid residues located in the first five-stranded β-sheet
of IsdBN1, and are thus most likely responsible for the
decreased stability of our initial IsdBN1 (residues 140–270)
construct.

Structural Docking of IsdBN1 onto
IsdHN2-Hb Complex and Engineering of IsdBN1 Protein
Variants
with Altered Hb-Binding Properties
The SSM module of the
Coot program was utilized to generate
a model of IsdBN1 in complex with methemoglobin (metHb)
(Figure ). The superposition and docking were
based on the recently published crystal structure of an IsdHN2-Hb complex. Most notable in the model
is that the disordered L2 loop region of IsdBN1 is positioned
opposite of the two α-helices A and E of the α-subunit
of metHb (Figure ). In the solution structure
of IsdHN1, a comparable loop (Loop 2) to that of IsdBN1, comprised of IsdHN1 residues Y125-Y126-H127-F128-F129-S130,
is disordered in the free form of IsdHN1, but undergoes a conformational change to form a short α-helix
upon Hb binding as observed in the crystal structure of IsdHN1:Hb. Equivalent amino acid residues
of IsdHN2 undergo a similar transition upon Hb binding
to form a well-ordered short α-helix upon formation of an IsdHN2:Hb complex. Two aromatic residues
in the loop 2 structure of IsdHN2 in particular, F365 and
Y368, appear to be key modulators of IsdHN2 binding to
metHb, as their side chains project outward from IsdHN2 ’s short α-helix structure and position themselves
at the interface of the IsdHN2:metHb complex.

Considering the high sequence conservation between
IsdBN1 and IsdHN2, examination of our model
of IsdBN1:metHb protein suggests that aromatic residues
F164 and Y167 of IsdBN1 may be key elements of IsdBN1’s Hb-binding
interface and may participate in critical interactions with metHb.
To investigate this possibility, three additional IsdBN1 protein constructs (i.e., IsdBN1 F164D and Y167D single
mutants, and F164D/Y167D double mutant) were engineered, with F164
and Y167 replaced by aspartic acid. Aspartic acid was selected as
amino acid choice for the site-directed mutagenesis experiments because
we anticipate that Asp, as a negatively charged residue, would have
a greater disrupting effect on IsdBN1’s capability
to bind metHb. Investigations of IsdBN1 proteins containing
F164D, Y167D, and F164D/Y167D amino acid substitutions could thus
provide strong evidence that the Hb-binding site of IsdBN1 includes these aromatic residues within loop 2, and that hydrophobic
interactions mediated by F164 and Y167 in wild type IsdBN1 are crucial for the formation of an IsdBN1:metHb complex
capable of transferring heme from metHb to IsdB.

Monitoring
of IsdBN1 Binding to metHb by Size Exclusion
Chromatography and 2D 1H–15N Correlation
HSQC NMR Spectroscopy
We examined IsdBN1’s
ability to bind metHb using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). When
injected singly, IsdBN1 and metHb migrate as single species
with apparent molecular mass of 19.4 kDa and 32.5 kDa, consistent
with monomeric and dimeric forms, respectively. At a 6:1 molar ratio
IsdBN1:metHb, the migration time (of metHb) is identical
to the elution time of metHb alone (Figure , chromatograms 1 and
2), indicating that formation of a tight complex between IsdBN1 and metHb does not occur. In contrast, mixtures of metHb
with IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 at a 6:1 molar ratio
under identical conditions shifted the metHb peak to now elute earlier
(Figure , chromatogram 3 and 4). The change
in elution volume correlated to an increase in molecular mass of ∼19
kDa, consistent with both IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 preferentially
binding one subunit of the α/β metHb dimer, at least under
the experimental SEC conditions. Thus, despite both high sequence
and structural similarities to IsdHN1 and IsdHN2, IsdBN1 has subtle yet significant differences in its
interactions with metHb.

proteins. Gel filtration

depicts the absorbance of the heme Soret band at 406 nm. Stacked chromatograms
are displayed with an offset of 200 milli-absorbance units. The dashed
line indicates the elution time of free metHb. The decrease in elution
volume for IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 in complex with
metHb correlates to an increase in molecular mass of 19 kDa consistent
with one IsdH Neat domain binding metHb. The decrease in elution volume
of IsdBN1-L in complex with metHb correlates to
an increase in molecular mass of ∼10 kDa, indicating less than
one IsdBN1-L bound per metHb.

To establish whether IsdBN1 does bind metHb, but
just
with a much lower affinity than that detectable by gel filtration,
NMR titration experiments were used to investigate the metHb binding
reaction to IsdBN1. NMR conditions allow for the “ligand”
and “receptor” concentrations to be kept much higher,
thus permitting the probing of weaker affinity interactions observed
via observation of changes in amide 1H/15N chemical
shifts, NMR signal intensity, and/or increases in spectral line broadening
as a function of the progressive addition of one reactant to the other.
Selective 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC
spectra from these titration experiments are shown in Figure . In the absence of metHb free in solution, the
2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of IsdBN1 exhibits well-resolved NH signals with 1H and 15N resonance linewidths characteristic of a well-folded monomeric
18 kDa protein (Figure , panel A). Progressive
titration of 15N-IsdBN1 up to a 1:1 molar ratio
of metHb to IsdBN1 elicited significant spectral changes
in the 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-IsdBN1. Most notable were the significant loss
of spectral intensity for the majority of the NH resonances and significant
spectral line broadening (Figure , panel B).
Upon further addition of 15N-IsdBN1 to this
solution mixture and up to a 3:1 IsdBN1:metHb molar ratio,
well dispersed 15N/1H amide resonances were
again observable and signal intensity recovered (Figure , panel C), indicating that addition of excess 15N-IsdBN1 does not result in formation of a larger nonspecific
aggregate with metHb but rather that the excess 15N-IsdBN1 protein remains free in solution. Specificity of the IsdBN1:metHb binding reaction was further verified by adding unlabeled
IsdBN1 to an NMR sample mixture of the 1:1 15N-IsdBN1:metHb complex. Addition of unlabeled IsdBN1 to the solution mixture causes 15N/1H amide signals of free 15N-IsdBN1 to reappear
in the corresponding 2D 1H–15N correlation
HSQC spectrum (Figure , panel D). These data
indicate that unlabeled IsdBN1 is able to compete out the 15N-labeled IsdBN1 which is originally bound to
metHb, and that formation of a specific IsdBN1:metHb complex
is reversible.

The metHb ratios are expressed in terms of a dimeric αβ
(MW 32.5 kDa) metHb species.

Additionally, to further rule out that these spectral changes
are
not due to nonspecific protein aggregation but rather are caused by
specific binding of IsdBN1 to metHb, these titration experiments
were repeated using apoHb (lacking heme) and an unrelated 15N-labeled crenarchaeal viral protein, E73, whose structure has been
solved in our laboratory and which does not interact with metHb. As shown in  Figure S1, titration of apoHb up to 1:1 molar ratio with IsdBN1 had no effect on the corresponding 2D-1H–15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-IsdBN1. Similarly,
no increase in NH resonance linewidths or loss of signal intensity
was observed upon addition of metHb to an unrelated 15N-E73
protein NMR sample (data not shown). These data thus confirm that
complex formation between 15N-IsdBN1 and metHb
is the results of specific interactions between the two proteins,
and that the loss of signal intensity observed in corresponding 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC spectra of 15N-IsdBN1:metHb samples is due to the slower overall reorientation
time of the complex in solution compared to free 15N-IsdBN1.

Analogous 2D 1H–15N
correlation NMR
titration experiments were conducted using the IsdBN1 protein
variants described above to assess the effect of amino acid substitutions
of L2 residues on the metHb binding properties of IsdBN1. Similar to what is observed for wild-type IsdBN1, titration
of 15N-IsdBN1(Y167D) up to a 1:1 molar ratio
of 15N-IsdBN1(Y167D):metHb resulted in the same
near complete disappearance of NH-resonance signals in the corresponding
2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the complex
(Figure , panels E and B), indicating that,
from an NMR standpoint, IsdBN1(Y167D) can still form a
complex with metHb. Further addition of 15N-IsdBN1(Y167D) to the solution mixture resulted in the full reappearance of 1H/15N amide signals in resulting 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra, although at a noticeable lower
excess concentration than what was needed for the wild-type 15N-IsdBN1 titration experiments. Addition of unlabeled
IsdBN1(Y167D) to the 1:1 15N-IsdBN1(Y167D):metHb sample resulted in the recovery of NH signal intensities,
also at a lower concentration than what was needed for wild type IsdBN1, suggesting that IsdBN1(Y167D) forms a weaker
complex with metHb and that Y167 modulates, albeit weakly, IsdBN1-metHb protein–protein interactions. In contrast,
progressive titration of 15N-IsdBN1(F164D) with
metHb resulted in no perturbation of signal intensity, or chemical
shift changes, or line broadening of NH signal in the 2D 1H–15N correlation HSQC spectrum of the 15N-IsdBN1(F164D): metHb mixture at equal molar ratios (Figure , panel E), indicating that substitution of Asp
for Phe at residue position 164 completely abrogates IsdBN1 binding to metHb at least under the conditions of these NMR titration
experiments, and that F164 is a critical mediator of IsdBN1-Hb protein–protein interactions. Taken together, IsdBN1 can form a weak complex with metHb and F164 within the L2
loop region of IsdBN1 is indeed a critical mediator of
IsdBN1:metHb protein–protein interactions.

Heme Transfer
Experiments
The effects of amino acid
substitutions within the Hb-binding region of IsdBN1 on
the rate of heme transfer from metHb to IsdBN1-L-N2 were
assessed by monitoring changes in UV–visible absorption of
the Soret band at 406 nm. Mixing of wild-type IsdBN1-L-N2 with metHb (Figure A) results in a rapid
decrease in the absorbance band at 406 nm which, when plotted as a
function of time, could be best fit with a single exponential decay
function with an observed rate constant of k1obs = 0.040 ± 0.001 s–1. Substituting
Y167 to Asp (i.e., mixing of IsdBN1(Y167D)-L-N2 with metHb) showed little effect on the rapid heme transfer rate
between IsdB and metHb (k1obs = 0.062
± 0.001 s–1), suggesting that Y167 does not
contribute significantly to IsdB-Hb interactions that promote heme
transfer from metHb to the NEAT 2 domain of IsdB. This result is consistent
with the NMR titration experiments which indicated that the 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled
IsdBN1(Y167D):metHb complex is very similar to the 2D 1H–15N-HSQC spectrum of wild-type 15N labeled IsdBN1:metHb complex (Figure , panels E and B). In contrast, the heme transfer rate between
metHb and IsdBN1(F164D)-L-N2 displayed a
4-fold decrease compared to wild-type IsdBN1-L-N2. Unexpectedly, the F164 mutation did not abolish heme capture despite
the apparent absence of metHb binding in the NMR titration experiments.
The intermediate rate suggests that although F164 contributes to metHb
binding, the substitution to Asp is not sufficient to completely abrogate
all metHb binding and subsequent heme transfer from metHB to IsdB
(Figure A). Interestingly, a re-examination
of the docked IsdBN1-metHb structure shows that the disruptive
effects expected for substitution of F164 to Asp may have been offset
by formation of a buried salt bridge with Lys 11 of metHb. Indeed
substituting F164 to Ala eliminates this interaction, and mixing IsdBN1(F164A)-L-N2 with metHb results in a slower
rate of heme transfer from metHB to IsdB (Figure A). Only upon mutations of both F164 and Y167 aromatic residues
to Asp (IsdBN1(F164D, Y167D)-L-N2) is
heme transfer between metHb and IsdB virtually abolished (k1obs = 0.004 ± 0.001 s–1) (Figure A). The heme transfer rate for
this IsdB double mutant is now equivalent to the rate of heme transfer
for IsdB proteins lacking the NEAT 1 domain (i.e., IsdBL-N2 and k1obs = 0.004 ± 0.001 s–1). Interestingly, a small but consistent difference
is observed in the heme transfer rates between metHb and IsdBN1(F164D, Y167D)-L-N2 and IsdBL-N2 versus that of metHb and IsdBN2. Since IsdBN2 does not interact with metHb directly, and its slow heme transfer
rate is thought to represent spontaneous heme dissociation from metHb
and reassociation with the apo-N2 domain, the slightly faster heme
transfer rate observed with IsdBL-N2 and IsdBN1(F164D, Y167D)-L-N2 suggests that residues
within the linker region contribute to metHb binding. Further analysis
of the two constructs IsdB35LN2 and IsdB 20LN2 (which contain 35 and 20 residues of the linker region extending
from the N2 domain) exhibit comparable heme transfer rates to that
of the IsdBN2 only domain, indicating that metHb interacting
residues may reside within the first half of the linker region. Consistent
with these results, size exclusion chromatography of a 6:1 molar ratio
IsdBN1-L:metHb mixture now showed a decrease in
the elution time of metHb, indicating IsdBN1-L can
form a complex with metHb (Figure ).

IsdBN2. Heme transfer was followed by monitoring changes
in absorbance at 406 nm over a 30 min time period. Only the first
5 min of the reactions are shown for clarity.

To investigate the effect of linker further, we re-examined
the
heme transfer ability of IsdBN1-L + IsBN2 under the same conditions. As reported, addition of the linker region
to the NEAT 1 domain accelerates the heme transfer rate far greater
than when attached to the IsdBN2 domain. Since SEC analysis of IsdBN1-L:metHb
did not show any presence of free heme, the increase in the heme transfer
rate between metHb and IsdBN2 would have to be attributed
to an increase in the efficiency of heme extraction by IsdBN2 as a result of covalent attachment to IsdB NEAT1 and linker domains.

Overall, these results demonstrate that amino acid residues within
loop 2 of IsdBN1 and, in particular, F164 contribute to
the Hb binding site of IsdB, and that efficient heme extraction from
Hb and efficient heme transfer to IsdB require synergistic interactions
between all three IsdB N1, linker, and N2 domains (IsdBN1-L-N2).

IsdBN1–Linker Interactions
Since
increases in heme transfer function and affinity to metHb by IsdBN1 following covalent attachment of the linker domain could
have arisen from a structural change in IsdBN1, we analyzed
the effect of the linker domain on the structure of IsdBN1 using NMR. Analysis of the 2D 1H–15N HSQC NMR data of the 15N-labeled IsdBN1-L protein relative to IsdBN1 showed no observable changes
in the N1 resonances in IsdBN1-L, implying little
interactions take place between linker and the N1 domain at least
in solution in the absence of metHb (see  Figure S2).

Discussion
In
this study, we report the 3D solution NMR structure of the first
NEAT domain of IsdB, IsdBN1 spanning residues 125–270
of the full-length native IsdB protein. Inspection of the structure
reveals that IsdBN1 is comprised of a prototypical β-sheet
rich immunoglobin-like fold similar to the ones observed for other
NEAT domain-containing proteins solved to date.

A DALI-based
structural alignment of IsdBN1, together
with structural information obtained from other NEAT-domain containing
proteins and structures reported in the PDB protein database, indicates
that IsdBN1 is most structurally similar to the NEAT 1
and NEAT 2 domains of IsdH, referred to as IsdHN1 and IsdHN2. This similarity is not unexpected, since IsdBN1 shares 46% and 65% amino acid sequence identity with IsdHN1 and IsdHN2, respectively. As mentioned, most of the (1H, 15N, 13C) NMR resonance signals originating
from IsdBN1 could be assigned to specific amino acids except
for one large contiguous stretch of residues located within the loop
2 region of IsdBN1 including four aromatic residues (F164Y165H166Y167) that, based
on our structural analysis and recent mutational studies, are critical
for IsdBN1 binding to Hb. Interestingly, a similar difficulty
with NMR resonance assignments was reported for corresponding IsdHN1 residues (Y125,Y126H127F128) in the solution NMR structure of free IsdHN1. The lack of observable NMR signals
for the four aromatic residues (F164Y165H166Y167) of IsdBN1 likely results from
substantial line broadening in the NMR spectrum which is most likely
due to chemical exchange on an intermediate (ms) time scale, reflecting
the intrinsic flexibility of L2 residues in the unbound solution state
of IsdBN1, similar to its homologue IsdHN1.

Recent studies investigating the importance of aromatic residues
within L2 have shown that they are critical for generating high affinity
interactions between IsdB, or IsdHN1 and IsdHN2, and Hb.,,, Experiments in which either single or multiple residues
within the L2 aromatic region were substituted resulted in a several
fold decrease in Hb binding, loss of Hb binding to S. aureus cells, or a significant decrease in the
rate of in vitro heme transfer from metHb to IsdB. Interestingly, in the crystal structures of IsdHN1:metHb and IsdHN2LN3:metHb protein complexes, these aromatic
residues adopt a well folded α-helical structure and interact
with amino acids of the A chain α-helix of metHb., The crystal structures of these protein complexes also reveal that
different aromatic residues within this “aromatic motif”
participate in formation of the Hb-binding interface of IsdH. The relatively high degree of flexibility within
the L2 region may be a prerequisite for specific Hb binding to IsdBN1, supporting a “folding upon binding” model
which is often observed for intrinsically disordered regions of proteins,, and the plasticity of Hb-binding NEAT domain architectures. However,
despite this flexibility, the particular nature of the aromatic residues
within the aromatic motif of IsdBN1, IsdHN2,
and IsdHN1 seems to be specific to each Hb-binding NEAT
domain, as swapping the aromatic motif of IsdHN1 for that
of IsdBN1 resulted in the inability of S.
aureus cells to bind to Hb. Further, engineering of an IsdBN1LN2 chimeric protein
construct in which the IsdBN1 domain is modified to include
the aromatic residues of IsdHN1 can no longer rapidly transfer
heme from metHb to IsdB. These data thus
demonstrate that the amino acid context surrounding the L2 aromatic
residues is necessary to promote tight Hb binding and rapid heme capture
from metHb to IsdB. The specific molecular context around the aromatic
motif of IsdBN1 and IsdHN1 may be the basis
for the weaker affinity of IsdBN1 for metHb (Kd is estimated in the micromolar range in this study)
compared to IsdHN1 (Kd has
been reported to be ∼20 nM for wild type IsdHN1 as
measured by SPR in ref ()).

In contrast to the IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains
that can form high affinity complexes with metHb,, IsdBN1 appears to bind metHb very weakly. Only in the presence
of millimolar concentrations of IsdBN1 and metHb were interactions
between the two proteins observable when studied by NMR. This result
is consistent with a recent study by Bowden et al. which demonstrates that immobilized metHb on nickel beads
was unsuccessful at pulling down a single domain of IsdBN1 (residues 126–270) or IsdBN1-L (residues 126–336)
in pull down assays, whereas a high affinity (nanomolar) interaction
with metHb could only be observed when both IsdB NEAT domains and
the intervening linker are present and contiguous. We observed that addition of the linker region is needed
to observe complex formation by gel filtration analysis, indicating
that the linker domain further increases the affinity of IsdBN1 for metHb. How the linker imparts this effect is, however,
unclear. In the IsdHN2LN3:metHb crystal structure, there
are no obvious protein–protein interaction sites between the
linker region and Hb. We also checked using NMR to see if addition
of the linker region changed the N1 domain structure.

Analysis
of the 2D 1H–15N HSQC NMR
data of 15N-labeled IsdBN1-L versus IsdBN1 proteins indicated that little if any interaction takes
place between linker and the N1 domain. This observation was also
made for IsdHN2LN3. In fact, based on the NMR titration
data, it would appear that the very C-terminal residues extending
from the N1 domain (residues Thr269–Asp272) act as a hinge
point within the IsdB multidomain structure. Support for this observation
is further gathered by examination of the crystal structure of IsdHN2LN3 in complex with metHb whereby comparable residues are
not observed in the electron density map, suggesting that the equivalent IsdH linker residues remain flexible
even upon binding to Hb. Linker protein interactions thus appear to
be an independent function separate from the N1 domain.

In the
NMR titration study with 15N-IsdBN1 and metHb,
attempts to identify specific amides interacting with
metHb via identification of 1H/15N amide chemical
shift perturbations proved unsuccessful, due to the significant line
broadening taking place in the 2D 1H–15N HSQC NMR spectrum of the 15N-IsdBN1:metHb
complex. This uniform broadening of NMR resonances happened quickly
upon mixing of the two proteins, and only resonances from the very
C-terminal residues (residues Thr269–Asp272) remained visible.
The NMR titration data did, however, indicate that the IsdBN1 protein appears to preferentially interact with metHb at a 1:1 ratio.
At an equal molar ratio of 15N-IsdBN1:metHb
(expressed in α/β metHb dimeric units) near complete line
broadening of the resonance was observed. At IsdBN1:metHb
ratios exceeding this, NMR resonance signals (indicative of free IsdBN1) reappeared. Previous binding studies on IsdH-N1 and -N2
have shown that each IsdH domain displays a higher binding affinity
for the α-subunits versus β-subunits of metHb, and SEC
analysis herein showed that IsdH-N1 and -N2 domains preferentially
bind only one metHb subunit. Therefore, IsdBN1 may be binding
in a similar manner, with specificity preference for the α-subunits
of Hb. It is important to note that the Clubb’s laboratory
has also shown clearly by both gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium
analysis that IsdH-N1/N2 domains can bind both α and β
subunits, and that the binding of all four Hb subunits is clearly
evident in the crystal structures of IsdHN2 and IsdHN2/N3 with metHb., Full length IsdB must
also bind to both the α and β subunits of Hb, as IsdB
can get about 70% of metHb heme in a single phase kinetics process (Zhu et al., manuscript under review).

Extensive studies aimed at identifying specific IsdB/H residues
that interact with Hb have focused on the conserved aromatic residues
within loop 2, a structural “aromatic motif” which appears
to be only present in the Hb-binding NEAT domains. Pishchany et al. demonstrated that mutation of any of these residues
within IsdB abrogated Hb binding to S. aureus cells and slowed heme transfer between metHb and IsdBN1-L-N2. Consistent with this data, our NMR and kinetic analysis results
demonstrate that F164 is indeed critical for IsdBN1 binding
to metHb and IsdBN1-L-N2’s ability
to rapidly extract heme from metHb and to a lesser extent Y167. The
fact that heme transfer can still occur with each amino acid substitution
is consistent with previous observations that although residues within the Hb-binding “aromatic motif”
site are important for IsdB and IsdH binding metHb, other residues
within IsdH-N1 and -N2 and IsdB-N1 domains are also important for
mediating IsdB/metHb protein–protein interactions. Analysis
of our docked model of IsdBN1 to metHb suggests that residues
within the loops spanning β1b and β2, β7 and β8,
and β3 and β4 are poised to make subtle contacts with
metHb. Similar interaction sites are also observed for IsdH-N1 and
-N2, and a comparison of IsdH and IsdB reveals no obvious differences
as to why IsdHN1 and IsdHN2 domains have a high
binding affinity for metHb whereas IsdBN1’s affinity
for metHb is lower.

Our heme transfer studies have revealed
that a contiguous IsdBN1-L-N2 is needed for
rapid transfer rates consistent
with other recently reported results. Interestingly, Bowden et al. have showed that an IsdBN1-L + IsdBN2 construct could also rapidly transfer heme in
vitro, suggesting that the IsdB linker region may also play a role
in metHb binding. We have observed a similar effect. This increase
in heme transfer function appears to be in stark contrast to IsdH
where an IsdHN2-L + IsdHN3/metHb mixture
resulted in only a negligible increase in heme transfer rate compared
to N3 alone. Thus, although IsdH and IsdB appear to function similarly
with respect to heme binding, the molecular mechanism of IsdB heme
capture from metHb appears to be subtly but significantly different
from that of IsdH. Further, our engineered IsdBN1(F164D,Y167D) double mutant constructs still displayed a faster heme transfer
rate than the apparent rate of heme dissociation (off rate) from metHb.
Heme transfer experiments using IsdBL-N2 constructs
of various linker length (Figure B) suggest
that residues within IsdB linker region that are interacting with
Hb and thereby contributing to an enhanced rate of heme transfer from
met-Hb must reside within the N-terminal half of the linker domain
as neither the 20L-N2 or 35L-N2 construct rescues the heme transfer
effect of IsdBL-N2 (see Figure B). No high-resolution structure has been reported for IsdB
linker domain. However, IsdB linker shares 70% sequence identity to
the IsdH linker region, which has been shown to adopt a three-helix
bundle structure in solution. CD spectroscopy
indicates that IsdB linker has propensity to form α-helical
structure. Thus, based on sequence similarity and CD data, one would
expect the linker structures of IsdB and IsdH to be similar if not
identical. However, NMR studies of IsdB linker in our laboratory do
not support this expectation. There appears to be no obvious “direct”
interactions of IsdH linker region with Hb that could provide a rationale
for the enhanced heme transfer effect observed, yet clearly the N1-linker
region of IsdB must be imparting a certain degree of structural strain
on Hb to facilitate heme release and/or to increase the rate of heme
dissociation from Hb upon complex formation with IsdB. In the crystal
structure of IsdHN1LN2 with metHb, no obvious structural
changes are observed for metHb upon binding to IsdH. Thus, the molecular mechanism by which IsdB linker region
enhances heme capture and transfer from metHb remains to be established.
It is possible that determination of a 3D structure of IsdBN1LN2 could reveal important structural changes within IsdB linker domain
that could explain its effect on heme transfer from metHb.

In
summary, we have solved the 3D solution NMR structure of the
hemoglobin-binding NEAT domain of IsdB, IsdBN1, encompassing
IsdB residues 125–270. We report that IsdBN1 adopts
a canonical immunoglobin-like fold, similar to that of other NEAT
domains and displays greatest structural similarity to NEAT 1 and
2 domains of IsdH, a closely related Hb/Haptoglobin-Hb receptor.,, The functional importance of
two aromatic residues, F164 and Y167 within a conserved stretch of
aromatic residues has been investigated and shown to be important
for IsdB binding to Hb. We find that F164 is critical for IsdBN1 binding to Hb and for an IsdBN1LN2 protein to
acquire heme from Hb efficiently, whereas residue Y167 appears more
resilient to amino acid substitution. Finally, we demonstrate that
the IsdB linker region increases the rate of heme transfer between
metHb and IsdBN2 in vitro, and that this functional difference
appears to be a result of an increase in the affinity of IsdB-N1 domain
for metHb via interactions of IsdB linker domain with metHb. Together,
these results show that it is the covalent and synergistic actions
of all three domains N1-L-N2 of IsdB that are necessary to facilitate
rapid heme transfer between metHb and IsdB.
