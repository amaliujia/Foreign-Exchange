In striated muscles, invaginations
from the plasma membrane, termed
transverse tubules (T-tubule), function in the excitation–contraction
coupling machinery. BIN1 (isoform8) plays a critical role in the biogenesis
of T-tubules. BIN1 contains an N-terminal BAR domain to sense and
induce membrane curvature, an isoform8-specific polybasic motif (exon10)
as the phosphoinositide binding module and a C-terminal Src homology
3 (SH3) domain for the recruitment of downstream proteins such as
dynamin 2. Previous studies of N-BAR domains focused on elucidating
mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and generation (MC-S&amp;G).
Less is known about how MC-S&amp;G is regulated. We found that the
SH3 domain binds to the exon10 motif more strongly compared to the
proline-rich domain (PRD) of dynamin 2. Furthermore, we found that
the MC-S&amp;G ability of full-length BIN1 is inhibited on membranes
lacking PI(4,5)P2. Addition of PI(4,5)P2 in
the membrane activates BIN1 to sense and induce membrane curvature.
Co-presence of the SH3 domain and exon10 motif leads to the strongest
phosphoinositide-mediated control of BIN1 function. Addition of SH3
domain ligand (such as PRD peptides), as well as addition of the water-soluble
PI(4,5)P2 analogue, can both enhance the MC-S&amp;G ability
of BIN1 on membranes without PI(4,5)P2, indicating that
the key to activate BIN1 is to disrupt the exon10–SH3 interaction.
The nonsense mutation K436X, found in centronuclear myopathy (CNM)
patients, abolishes SH3 domain binding with either exon10 or the PRD
motif, resulting in increased membrane deformation capacity. Our results
suggest an autoinhibition model for BIN1 that involves a synergistic
regulation by membrane composition and protein–protein interactions.

Cell membrane
remodeling is
accomplished through the precise temporal and spatial assembly of
membrane-interacting peripheral proteins.1,2 BIN1,
also known as amphiphysin2, is such a protein involved in regulating
membrane shape transitions during endocytosis and membrane trafficking.3,4 Recently, BIN1 has drawn a lot of attention due to its implication
in several human diseases.5 BIN1 proteins
are involved in cancer progression, heart failure, and late-onset
Alzheimer’s disease.5,6 However, the tissue-specific
pathological mechanisms and disease pathways remain unclear. BIN1’s
capacity for membrane deformation is contributed by its N-terminal
BAR domain (Figure 1), which forms a dimerized
helical bundle and binds to membranes with its positively charged
concave interface.7 BIN1 is subject to
alternative splicing, leading to isoforms with specific functions
in various tissues.8,9 The BIN1 isoform8, which is enriched
in striated muscle tissues, contains a polybasic sequence (exon10
motif) acting as a phosphoinositol-binding motif (Figure 1).10,11 Past studies have shown that
the isoform8 has phosphoinositide binding specificity toward PI(4,5)P2in vitro.10 The
physiological function of BIN1 isoform8 is to induce plasma membrane
invaginations to form transverse tubules (T-tubules), which propagate
action potentials.3,10,12,13 In addition to the N-terminal membrane-modulating
domain, the C-terminal SH3 domain serves as an adaptor for downstream
ligand recruitment. SH3 domains are found in a great variety of BAR
domain proteins.11 SH3 domains recruit
downstream proteins primarily through interaction with canonical PxxP
sequences.11,14 For instance, endophilin recruits
dynamin to the neck of a clathrin-coated pit to accomplish membrane
scission.15,16 This is achieved by the hydrophobic interaction
between the aromatic residues in the SH3 domain and the PxxP sequence
in dynamin.17−19

Figure 1 Domain diagrams of human BIN1 isoform8 variants investigated
in
this study.

Recent studies have pointed
out that the SH3 domain can act not
only as a recruiting module but also can regulate protein conformation
and function through an autoinhibition mechanism in which the SH3
domain intramolecularly binds to the rest of the protein resulting
in a closed, inactive conformation. The Haucke group provided structural
evidence supporting an SH3 domain-mediated autoinhibition in syndapin1
in which the SH3 domain interacts with the BAR domain and locks syndapin
into a state with compromised membrane deformation capacity.20 Addition of dynamin1-derived PRD peptide dissociates
the SH3 domain of syndapin1 from the BAR domain and rescues membrane
curvature generation.20 Such a regulatory
role of SH3 domain also exists in N-BAR domain proteins. The SH3 domain
of endophilin is able to complex with the N-terminal membrane-inserting
helix (H0) to regulate BAR domain dimerization kinetics.21 Both experiments and simulations have demonstrated
that H0 is bound with the SH3 domain of the second monomer
within the same dimer in solution, and this interaction slows the
subunit exchange between N-BAR dimers.21,22 Moreover,
McMahon et al. reported that both endophilin and amphiphysin are autoinhibited
through their SH3 domain, which impairs their membrane recruitment.16 In the BIN1 isoform8, the binding between exon10
and SH3 domains suggests a potential mechanism for autoinhibition.
Both a pull-down assay and NMR have shown that the exon10 motif can
directly bind to the SH3 domain.11 The
binding interface of the SH3 domain for exon10 overlaps with that
for PRD peptides.11 Such intramolecular
complexation inhibits dynamin recruitment. However, little is known
about the impact of autoinhibition on the membrane remodeling capacity
of BIN1, particularly in the context of MC-S&amp;G.

We found
that exon10 binds with SH3 domains with higher affinity
compared to PRD due to an enrichment of basic residues in exon10.
Using micropipette-assisted tether-pulling, we found that full-length
BIN1 cannot sense curvature of membrane tubules lacking PI(4,5)P2, as opposed to BIN1 variants lacking either exon10 or SH3
domain. Addition of PI(4,5)P2 or dynamin 2-derived proline-rich
domain significantly enhances the curvature sensing ability. Corresponding
findings were obtained from a membrane deformation assay. We expanded
our study to disease mutations in the SH3 domain and found that an
SH3 truncation mutant showed loss of PI(4,5)P2-regulated
MC-S&amp;G. Taken together, our data suggest an autoinhibition mechanism
in BIN1 and synergistic activation by PI(4,5)P2 and downstream
proteins.

Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The fluorophores Alexa Fluor 488 C5-maleimide
and TexasRed-1, 2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-phoethanolamine
triethylammonium salt (TR-DHPE) were from Invitrogen Life Technologies
(Grand Island, NY). Streptavidin-conjugated microspheres with a diameter
of 6 μm were from Polysciences (Warrington, PA).

DNA Construct
Expression Protein Purification
DNA sequences
coding for BIN1 N-BAR* (1–282) and BIN1-FL (1–454) were
amplified by PCR and inserted into mKate-N1 and pGEX-4T-2 vector.
The CNM-related mutation K436X and the exon10-deleted mutant were
constructed by standard primer-directed PCR mutagenesis. All constructs
were sequenced. BIN1 variants were expressed as GST-fusion proteins
in BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-RIL bacteria (Stratagene). Transformed cells
were grown at 37 °C to reach an OD600 of 0.8, after which protein
expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 16 h at 18 °C. Bacteria
were spun down, resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM
NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4), and finally lysed on ice by tip
sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto
a GST-affinity column equilibrated with lysis buffer. Elution was
carried out using the following buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM reduced
glutathione, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. GST-tag cleavage was accomplished
through thrombin digestion at room temperature for 4 h, and BIN1 was
further purified by ion exchange and gel filtration (GE Healthcare).
BIN1 was labeled on its endogenous cysteine residues, through overnight
incubation with Alexa 488 C5-maleimide (Invitrogen) at 4 °C.
Passing three times through a desalting column removed free fluorophores.
Protein concentrations were measured by standard Bradford assay (Thermo
Scientific, 0.5%–1% uncertainty in protein concentration, n = 3), and concentrations of fluorophores were determined
by absorbance at 494 nm (assuming a molar extinction coefficient of
71 000 cm–1 M–1). The labeling
efficiency was calculated as follows: Labeling efficiency [%] = Alexa
488 concentration/protein concentration × 100. All protein samples
used in our study were ultracentrifuged after thawing to remove potential
aggregates. Before each experiment, protein concentrations were assessed
via Bradford assay. No sample stored at 4 °C for longer than
1 week was used in this study.

Peptide Synthesis and Purification
The exon10 peptide
(sequence: RKKSKLFSRLRRKKN) and dynamin 2-derived proline-rich
domain peptide (sequence: PPQIPSRPVRIPPGI) were synthesized
via solid phase peptide synthesis, using 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
(FMOC) chemistry. After resin cleavage, peptides were purified by
reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purity
of the synthesized peptides was &gt;95%. The molecular weight of the
peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The rhodamine-conjugated
PRD peptides were labeled at the N-terminus.

Cell Culture, Transfection,
and Confocal Fluorescence Imaging
Myoblasts (C2C12 cells)
were cultured in DMEM medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in MatTek
glass bottom culture dishes to 95% confluency before transfection.
Transfection was done via Lipofectamin2000 (Life Technologies, Invitrogen),
using 1.5 μg of mKate-tagged DNA and incubation at 37 °C,
5% CO2 for 5 h before change to culture medium. After 24
h, cells were imaged with a confocal microscopy (FV300) laser scanning
system based on an inverted microscope IX81 (Olympus, Center Valley,
PA) using a 60×, 1.2 NA water immersion lens (Olympus). Images
were imported into, and processed with, ImageJ.

Liposome Preparation
Liposomes used in the tubulation
assay were prepared using a composition of 64% DOPC/26% DOPS/10% DOPE,
or 68% DOPC/20% DOPS/2% PI(4,5)P2/10% DOPE. Mixtures of
lipids were air-dried to form thin films and left under a vacuum for
at least 2 h before rehydration in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4
buffer. The final lipid concentration was 1 mg/mL. After sonication
for 15 min, liposomes were extruded through 400 nm nuclepore membranes
(Whatman) five times. All liposome dispersions were stored at 4 °C.

GUVs (64% DOPC/26% DOPS/10% DOPE or 68% DOPC/20% DOPS/2% PI(4,5)P2/10% DOPE) were prepared by the standard method of electroswelling
in 0.3 M sucrose solution.23 0.5% DSPE-Bio-PEG2000
and TR-DHPE were also included in the lipid mixtures. The osmolarity
of GUV dispersions was measured with a micro-osmometer (Advanced Instruments
Inc., Norwood, MA).

Liposome Tubulation Assay
BIN1 variants
were incubated
with liposomes (lipid composition described above) in 20 mM Hepes,
150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer at room temperature for 30 min. The final
protein concentration was 5 μM, and the lipid concentration
was 0.2 mg/mL. Then samples were adsorbed to carbon/Formvar supported
copper grids (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) for 5 min.
Grids were washed with buffer and blotted on a filter paper (Whatman)
to remove excess sample. The grids were stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl
acetate for 1 min. Excess stain was washed away, and the samples were
dried at room temperature. Samples were observed with a JEM 1011 transmission
electron microscope (JEOL, USA) with an accelerating voltage of 100
kV. Images were analyzed with ImageJ.

BIN1 Curvature Sorting
Measurements
Protein curvature
sorting measurements were carried out in a chamber constructed from
glass slides, containing GUV dispersions and protein solution. Two
micropipettes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), which were
fabricated with the help of a pipette puller and a microforge, were
inserted into the sample chamber through a three-dimensional motorized
manipulator system (Luigs and Neumann, Ratingen, Germany). The lateral
tension of micropipette-aspirated vesicles was controlled by adjusting
the height of a connected water reservoir, and measured by a pressure
transducer with a DP-28 diaphragm (Validyne Engineering, Los Angeles,
CA). Membrane tethers were pulled with the help of a streptavidin-coated
bead that was moved with a second aspiration pipette. Kalman-averaged
images of the tether cross section (xz plane, which
was orthogonal to the axis of the tether) allowed measurement of the
tether fluorescence intensities. These images were obtained using
a stepwidth of 0.15 μm and a total imaging depth of 6 μm,
and were background-corrected and analyzed in an elliptical region
of interest to obtain the protein and lipid intensity signals under
varying tensions. For each protein, at least five independent experiments
were carried out and binned after analysis.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
(ITC) Measurements
ITC binding reactions were performed with
a MicroCal iTC200 system
(GE Healthcare, Life Sciences) at 25 °C. Protein and peptide
samples were dialyzed side by side in 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4 buffer containing
0 mM, 50 mM, or 150 mM NaCl. A total of 40 μL of the ligand
in the injection syringe was titrated into a 200 μL reaction
cell in 16 or 20 cycles. The duration of each injection was 4 or 5
s with an interval of 120 s between injections. ITC data from at least
four independent experiments were analyzed with MicroCal’s
custom scripts in Origin 7.0 (OriginLab). Integrated heats from all
the binding reactions could be fitted well with a single-site binding
model. Concentrations used in the ITC measurement were as follows.
Exon10-SH3 domain binding: 500 μM exon10 peptide in the injection
syringe and 50 μM GST-SH3 domain in the reaction cell; PRD-SH3
domain binding: 1 mM PRD peptide in the injection syringe and 50 μM
GST-SH3 domain in the reaction cell; exon10-SH3/K436X mutant binding:
500 μM exon10 peptide in the injection syringe and 50 μM
GST-SH3/K436X mutant in the reaction cell; exon10–IP3 binding:
500 μM exon10 peptide in the injection syringe and 25 μM
IP3 in the reaction cell.

Results
Exon10 Motif
Binds to the SH3 Domain More Strongly than the
PRD Peptide
We compared the exon10–SH3 domain to the
PRD–SH3 domain binding affinity through ITC. We first titrated
the synthetic exon10 peptides (RKKSKLFSRLRRKKN) into recombinant
GST-SH3 domains (derived from BIN1) (Figure 2A,B). Because of the basic nature of the exon10 peptide, we investigated
the effects of the salt concentration on exon10-SH3 domain binding.
Consistent with expectation, lowering ionic strength increases the
affinity of the exon10 peptide for the SH3 domain, indicating that
the exon10–SH3 binding is driven by electrostatic interactions
(Figure 2C). Fitting with a single site binding
model yielded a dissociation constant Kd of 3.9 ± 0.2 μM in 50 mM NaCl buffer (Figure 2A, data are represented as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) of at least six trials) and 11.3 ± 0.6
μM in 150 mM NaCl buffer (Figure 2B).
Of course, this affinity of SH3–exon10 interactions will be
enhanced in the full-length protein through the tethering effect because
the binding partners are localized within the same polypeptide chain.24,25 When the exon10 peptide was titrated into BIN1-FL protein, the reaction
did not reach saturation rendering the determination of Kd and stoichiometry inaccurate due to the low affinity
for the full-length protein (data not shown). The reduced affinity
of exon10 binding to full-length protein compared to SH3 domain is
consistent with a competition of free exon10 with the endogenous exon10–SH3
complex and thus supports an autoinhibition model involving exon10–SH3
binding.

Figure 2 The binding affinity of the exon10–SH3 complex is higher
than that of SH3–PRD. Both are dependent on solution ionic
strength. The association between exon10–SH3 and PRD–SH3
was characterized by ITC in which 500 μM exon10 peptide or 1
mM PRD (derived from dynamin 2) was titrated into 50 μM GST-SH3
domain (derived from BIN1) in (A) 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.4
buffer and (B) 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Curves were
fitted by a single-site binding model, and the dissociation constant, Kd, and the fit standard error are shown for
each titration. Of note, the stoichiometry, N, of
each titration is found to be close to 1, indicating a single SH3
domain binding site for both ligands. Reducing the salt concentration
enhances both exon10–SH3 and PRD–SH3 association. (C)
Comparison of averaged dissociation constants at varied solution conditions.

SH3 domains are known proline-rich domain recruiters.26 To evaluate this binding strength, we titrated
a PRD peptide (PPQIPSRPVRIPPGI, derived from dynamin 2)
into a GST–SH3 domain solution. As for exon10–SH3 domain
binding, ionic strength-sensitive PRD–SH3 domain binding was
observed, albeit with lower binding affinity (Figure 2A,B). The Kd obtained for the
SH3–PRD interaction was 13.7 ± 1.2 μM and 68.3 ±
4.9 μM in 50 mM and 150 mM NaCl buffer, respectively (Figure 2A,B). The salt effect on the dissociation constant
agrees with the extensive patch of negative electrostatic potential
covering a large portion of the dynamin binding site of the SH3 domain14 and two conserved Arg residues in the PxRPxR
consensus sequence26 of the dynamin 2 PRD
domain. The weaker binding affinity of the PRD peptide to the SH3
domain compared to the exon10 motif (Figure 2C) further supports the notion that the SH3 domain can be masked
from its PRD ligand due to the stronger exon10–SH3 interaction.
Ligand recruitment may require sufficiently high concentration of
the downstream proteins to compete with the exon10 motif. Alternatively,
other regulatory mechanisms may release the SH3 domain, for example,
through phosphoinositide binding during plasma membrane binding.11

It is currently unclear how exactly the
exon10 motif interacts
with membranes. CD spectra of exon10 peptides in solution, as well
as on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes, reveal a characteristic
peak of random coils at 204 nm (Figure S1, Supporting
Information).27 This observation
implies that exon10 peptides, unlike the membrane-inserting, amphipathic
helices in N-BAR domain proteins,28−31 do not adopt secondary structure
upon membrane association. It is likely that the exon10 motif may
not be able to penetrate into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer
to induce membrane curvature.32 This finding
is compatible with the highly charged nature of the exon10 sequence.
Furthermore, corresponding behavior has been found for the effector
domain of the myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS-ED)
peptide, which is another membrane binding peptide enriched in basic
residues.33,34

Curvature Sensing Ability of BIN1-FL Is Inhibited
on PI(4,5)P2-Absent Membranes
It has been shown
that N-BAR domains
function as curvature sensors.35−37 The curvature sensing process
is defined as enrichment of proteins on curved membranes, and in turn,
stabilization of tubular membranes. This is crucial to a great number
of cellular processes. Particularly, BIN1 is responsible for the membrane
tubulation process in myocytes. We have previously demonstrated that
the N-BAR domain from BIN1 preferentially partitions onto cylindrical
tethers compared to flat membranes.37 We
next asked how the exon10–SH3 domain interaction affects MC-S&amp;G
and whether phosphoinositides regulate the BIN1–membrane interaction
through a mechanism similar to their regulation of dynamin recruitment.11 To compare membrane curvature sensing of BIN1-FL
on membranes with and without PI(4,5)P2, we used a micropipette-assisted
tether-pulling assay.

For this purpose, the following two lipid
compositions were chosen that are meant to mimic inner leaflet headgroup
compositions (but to prevent lipid demixing): (1) 68% DOPC/20% DOPS/10%
DOPE/2% PI(4,5)P2 (abbreviated as (+) PI(4,5)P2); (2) 64% DOPC/26% DOPS/10% DOPE (abbreviated as (−) PI(4,5)P2). The charge densities in these two compositions are similar
assuming that the charge of PI(4,5)P2 is −3 at physiological
buffer conditions.38−41 A tubular membrane was pulled from a pipette-aspirated giant unilamellar
vesicle (GUV) by a polystyrene bead, and membrane tension was controlled
by the aspiration pressure in the micropipette. The radius of the
cylindrical tubule is inversely related to membrane tension. The membrane
curvature of the tether can therefore be well controlled by changing
the aspiration pressure. Figure 3A,B shows
fluorescence intensities of the tether cross-section in both protein
and lipid channel plotted against membrane tension. On (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes, by increasing membrane tension, the protein fluorescence
signals on the tether cross sections were observed to increase, while
the fluorescence intensities for the lipid channel were decreasing
(Figure 3A). In sharp contrast, for (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes, both protein and lipid fluorophore
fluorescence intensities decreased when the tether radius decreased
(Figure 3B). To obtain a quantitative characterization
of the curvature sensing ability of BIN1-FL, we calculated the ratio Ir of protein (green label) and lipid (red label)
fluorescence intensities on the tether (Ir = Igreent/Iredt) and divided it by the corresponding
ratio on the vesicle (Ir0 = Igreenv/Iredv). This partitioning
ratio, Ir/Ir0, can be shown
to be proportional to the protein density on the tether normalized
by the protein density on the GUV.42,43Ir/Ir0 has been observed for several (albeit not
all) proteins to vary linearly with the square root of membrane tension
Σ1/2, in accordance with a first-order thermodynamic
theory.42−44 The slope of the Ir/Ir0 – Σ1/2 relationship is
related to the curvature sorting ability of a given protein. We found
significant curvature sorting of BIN1-FL on membranes containing PI(4,5)P2. However, on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes, the
partitioning ratio barely increases with the square root of membrane
tension yielding a linear fit slope substantially smaller compared
to the case of (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes (Figure 3C).

Figure 3 Curvature sensing ability of BIN1-FL is inhibited on membranes
lacking PI(4,5)P2. Alexa488 conjugated BIN1-FL (40 nM)
was incubated with TexasRed-DHPE labeled GUVs. A GUV was aspirated
by a micropipette, and membrane tension was controlled by the aspiration
pressure. A tether was pulled by an aspirated streptavidin-coated
polystyrene bead, and the confocal images of the tether cross sections
were recorded. Fluorescence intensities of protein and lipid in tether
cross sections were plotted against membrane tension Σ. The
protein intensities responded differently to changes in the membrane
tension on (A) (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes and (B) (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes. (C) Data from 10 vesicles were binned
(vertical error bars represent SEM; horizontal error bars show SEM
of the square root of membrane tension) for two different lipid compositions.
The solid lines show linear fits to guide the eye. Membrane curvature-coupled
protein partitioning behavior is only observed on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. (D) demonstrates similar protein adsorption isotherm
on (+) PI(4,5)P2 or (−) PI(4,5)P2 GUVs.
Error bars: SEM. Lipid compositions: (+) PI(4,5)P2: 68%
DOPC/20% DOPS/10% DOPE/2% PI(4,5)P2; (−) PI(4,5)P2: 64% DOPC/26% DOPS/10% DOPE. Buffer: 50 mM NaCl, Hepes buffer,
pH 7.4. F.I.: fluorescence intensity; a.u.: arbitrary unit.

We note that in the curvature
sensing assay, we selected for analysis
GUVs displaying comparable protein fluorescence intensities, in order
to exclude the influence of protein density on curvature coupling.36 We found that BIN1-FL binds to (±) PI(4,5)P2 GUVs with comparable affinities. Figure 3D shows a titration of BIN1-FL into (±) PI(4,5)P2 GUVs. The dissociation constant Kd was obtained by fitting a Langmuir isotherm model to the titration
curve. BIN1-FL binds to (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes with a Kd of 371 ± 59 nM and to (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes with a Kd of 883 ±
165 nM, respectively. We only fitted data for which membrane tubulation
was not visible on GUVs. The membrane binding affinity was slightly
increased on the PI(4,5)P2-present membrane possibly due
to the multivalency of the PI(4,5)P2 headgroup39 and/or increased membrane penetration driven
by PI(4,5)P2.45 The effect of
PI(4,5)P2 on the curvature sensing ability of BIN1-FL is
more dramatic than the effect on membrane binding. Overall, our data
suggest that BIN1 senses membrane curvature in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner.

The PI(4,5)P2-Dependent Curvature
Sorting Ability
Requires Co-Presence of SH3 Domain and exon10 Motif
We next
aimed to evaluate possible mechanisms responsible for the differing
curvature sorting abilities of BIN1 on (±) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. Specifically, we asked whether exon10–SH3 association
contributes to the dependency of BIN1 function on lipid composition.
Therefore, curvature sorting was determined on (±) PI(4,5)P2 compositions for truncated BIN1 versions (Figure 1) meant to disrupt SH3–exon10 interactions:
BIN1 N-BAR (aa: 1–254, Figure 4A), BIN1
N-BAR* (aa: 1–282, Figure 4B), and BIN1-FL-Δexon10
(BIN1-FL-Δaa: 255–269, Figure 4C). The PI(4,5)P2-dependent curvature sorting was weaker
in mutants lacking SH3 domain and/or exon10 (Figure 4A–C). These observations demonstrate that the co-presence
of the exon10 and SH3 domain is responsible for hindering curvature
coupling of BIN1 on membranes without PI(4,5)P2. We acknowledge
that the curvature sensing ability of BIN1 truncates is higher on
(+) PI(4,5)P2 compared to (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes, which may indicate specific effects of PI(4,5)P2 on membrane interactions with BAR domains.45 However, all truncation variants do show significant curvature sorting
behavior on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes (Figure 4A–C), different from the full-length protein
(Figure 3C). Thus, only for BIN1-FL, membranes
lacking PI(4,5)P2 result in an inactive state incapable
of sensing membrane curvature. Addition of PI(4,5)P2 to
the membrane allows exon10 to interact with the membrane and releases
the SH3 domain. Deletion of either SH3 domain or exon10 motif disrupts
this regulatory mechanism. Taken together, BIN1 is autoinhibited via
an exon10–SH3 complex and can be activated through phosphoinositides
in the membrane.

Figure 4 Curvature sensing ability of BIN1 variants lacking either
exon10
or SH3 domain is less dependent on PI(4,5)P2 than BIN1-FL.
Normalized ratio of fluorescence intensities between protein and lipid
channels were plotted against the square root of membrane tension
for (A) N-BAR (400 nM), (B) N-BAR* (40 nM), and (C) BIN1-FL-Δexon10
(400 nM) on GUVs (±) PI(4,5)P2. Error bar: SEM.

Membrane Curvature Generation
Ability of BIN1-FL Is Compromised
on (−) PI(4,5)P2 Membranes
BIN1 is not
only a membrane curvature sensor but also a curvature generator.29,30 N-BAR domains from BIN1 can induce membrane tubulation.37 To investigate if the curvature generation capacity
of BIN1 is autoinhibited and regulated by phosphoinositides, we characterized
the membrane morphologies modulated by BIN1 and its variants via negative
staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the absence of
BIN1 protein, liposomes did not show membrane tubules for either (+)
PI(4,5)P2 or (−) PI(4,5)P2 composition
(Figure 5A). Upon the incubation with 5 μM
BIN1-FL, tubules with a diameter of 28.4 ± 0.7 nm were generated
from (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. Vesiculation (individual
vesicles boxed in Figure 5A) was observed as
well, which is a general feature for N-BAR domain containing amphipathic
membrane-inserting helices.30,46 However, significantly
less membrane shape changes were observed on (−) PI(4,5)P2 liposomes. The morphology of those vesicles was similar to
the ones in the lipid control (Figure 5A).
This finding confirms that the curvature generation ability of full-length
protein is inhibited on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes,
in correspondence with the curvature sensing ability of BIN1-FL.

Figure 5 Tubulation
capacity of BIN1-FL is autoinhibited on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes in vitro. The autoinhibition in
curvature generation requires co-presence of exon10 and SH3 motif.
(A) Electron micrographs of LUVs (±) PI(4,5)P2 (0.2
mg/mL) incubated with 5 μM BIN1-FL, N-BAR* and BIN1-FL-Δexon10
in 20 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 at room temperature. Samples were
negatively stained and imaged by TEM. In the lipid control sample,
no membrane tubules were observed. Upon the addition of BIN1-FL, tubulation
and vesiculation (generation of vesicles with the diameter less than
30 nm, boxed in the BIN1-FL/(+) PI(4,5)P2 panel) were induced
only on the PI(4,5)P2-containing membrane. Much less curvature
generation through BIN1-FL was observed in membranes without PI(4,5)P2. Neither N-BAR* nor BIN1-FL-Δexon10 showed lipid composition-dependent
tubulation capacity. Reduced membrane reshaping ability of BIN1-FL-Δexon10
variant is due to the lower membrane binding capacity. Scale bar:
200 nm. (B) Confocal images of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with BIN1-FL,
N-BAR* or N-BAR* D151N mutant conjugated with red fluorescence protein,
mKate, at the C-terminus. In vivo, membrane tubules
are induced both by BIN1-FL and N-BAR*, indicating release of autoinhibition
at the plasma membrane. Scale bar: 20 μm.

Next we aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the inhibited
curvature generation results from the co-presence of SH3 domain and
exon10. We therefore studied the tubulation ability of BIN1 N-BAR*
and BIN1-FL-Δexon10 on the two lipid compositions (±) PI(4,5)P2 (Figure 5A). As expected, BIN1 N-BAR*
domains are able to induce spontaneous tubulation from both lipid
compositions. For the BIN1-FL-Δexon10 mutant, reduced tubulation
was observed. The number of membrane tubules decreased compared to
BIN1-FL and N-BAR*. This can be explained by the compromised electrostatic
interactions of BIN1-FL−Δexon10 with the membrane. The
membrane deformation ability of BIN1-FL−Δexon10 is similar
in the absence or presence of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane.
We conclude that as for curvature sensing, the PI(4,5)P2-dependent tubulation ability of BIN1-FL is caused by the co-presence
of SH3 domain and exon10.

We next asked if BIN1 is autoinhibited
at the plasma membrane.
When transfecting plasmids encoding a red fluorescent protein conjugated
to BIN1 N-BAR* or BIN1-FL in C2C12 myoblasts, membrane tubulation
was caused by both constructs. As shown in Figure 5B, invaginations from the cell membrane were induced by both
N-BAR* and BIN1-FL, suggesting that autoinhibition of BIN1’s
membrane sculpting ability is released at the plasma membrane. Contrarily,
a tubulation-defective version of N-BAR* (mutation D151N within the
N-BAR* domain) leads to essentially homogeneously distributed fluorescence
in cells (rightmost panel in Figure 5B). This
observation is in accordance with the compromising effects of disease-related
mutations in BAR domains on membrane deformation and further supports
the role of full-length BIN1 in T-tubule biogenesis in vivo.3,10 The spontaneous activation of BIN1-FL at plasma membranes
likely is due to their specific lipid composition. It is known that
PI(4,5)P2 is enriched in the inner leaflet of the plasma
membrane.47 Given our observations that
the binding of exon10 to PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane switches
BIN1 into an active conformation allowing sensing and induction of
membrane curvature (Figures 3 and 5), BIN1-FL likely is activated upon plasma membrane
binding and remains inactive in the cytosol or other intracellular
compartments.

We hypothesize that another way to activate BIN1
is through dissociation
of the exon10–SH3 complex by SH3 domain association with a
ligand, such as dynamin 2 or other PRD domain containing proteins.
Such an activation mechanism has been proposed in the autoinhibition
model of syndapin, in which the addition of the PRD peptide rescued
the tubulation ability of syndapin.20,46 Consistent
with this finding, ligand binding to the SH3 domain of the cytoskeletal
protein IRSp53 leads to activation of this protein.24 We therefore next tested if downstream ligand recruitment
affects BIN1 autoinhibition.

PRD Peptide Releases Autoinhibition of BIN1-FL
Curvature Sensing
and Generation
So far, we have demonstrated that PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane modulates membrane curvature sensing and
generation ability of BIN1. In order to test our hypothesis that SH3
domain ligands are able to release autoinhibition, we preincubated
BIN1-FL with 200 μM PRD (well above Kd at the ionic strength chosen; see Figure 2) peptide prior to performing curvature sensing measurements on (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes. Co-incubation with PRD peptide enhanced
the protein partitioning onto the membrane tether. The protein fluorescence
intensities increased while the membrane tether got narrower as indicated
by the drop in lipid fluorophore intensities (Figure 6A). Note that the trend of protein signal changing with membrane
tension (green data points in Figure 6A) is
opposite compared to the one in Figure 3B,
although no PI(4,5)P2 was present in the membrane. The
slope of the Ir/Ir0–Σ1/2 relationship deviates significantly from the case in which
the PRD was absent (Figure 6B). The activation
of BIN1-FL through PRD peptides on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes further supports our hypothesis that the exon10–SH3
complexation compromises the membrane remodeling function of BIN1.
Either the binding to PI(4,5)P2 (by exon10) or PRD motif
(by SH3 domain) can release the autoinhibitory interaction and induce
BIN1 to adopt a conformation suitable for membrane remodeling.

Figure 6 Addition of
PRD increases the curvature sensing and generation
capacity of BIN1 on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. (A)
Membrane curvature sensing assay was performed using the (−)
PI(4,5)P2 lipid composition in 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM NaCl,
pH 7.4 buffer. 40 nM BIN1-FL was preincubated with 200 μM dynamin
2-derived PRD peptide for 15 min prior to the experiment. A membrane
tether was formed as described in the Materials and
Methods. Fluorescence intensities of protein and lipid on the
tether cross sections were measured and plotted against membrane tension
Σ. BIN1-FL enriched on the tether when increasing membrane tension
as opposed to Figure 3B where PRD was absent.
Panel (B) demonstrates that association with PRD peptide activates
the curvature sensing ability of BIN1-FL on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. (C) Electron micrographs of 5 μM BIN1-FL
or 5 μM BIN1-FL mixed with 200 μM PRD peptide interacting
with LUVs (±) PI(4,5)P2 in the 20 mM Hepes, 50 mM
NaCl buffer. Samples were stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution
for contrast enhancement. Scale bar: 200 nm. Morphologies of the liposomes
were categorized into three types: intact vesicles: vesicles with
diameters larger than 30 nm; vesiculation: vesicles with diameter
less than 30 nm; and tubulation. BIN1-FL induces vesiculation of (+)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes but not of (−) PI(4,5)P2 liposomes. The inset shows an enlarged image of the vesicles
in the boxed area. The scale bar in the inset is 50 nm. Addition of
PRD peptide results in both increased tubulation and vesiculation
from the (−) PI(4,5)P2 LUVs. The percentage of the
three membrane morphologies was quantified through image analysis.

We next investigated if coincubation
with PRD peptide is able to
rescue the membrane deformation ability as well. PRD peptide (200
μM) was first incubated with BIN1-FL (5 μM) before addition
to (−) PI(4,5)P2 LUVs. As a control, BIN1-FL was
added (at the same concentration) to (±) PI(4,5)P2 LUVs without PRD peptides. The tubulation assay was performed in
50 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM (Figure 5) due
to the dependence of PRD-SH3 binding on salt concentration and to
achieve consistency with experimental conditions used for the tether-pulling
assay. TEM images of each condition are shown in Figure 6C. In order to quantitatively evaluate the membrane curvature
generation capacity, we divided the observed morphologies into three
groups: (1) vesiculation: liposomes with diameters less than 30 nm;
(2) tubulation: elongated membranes; and (3) unchanged vesicles with
diameters larger than 30 nm. We consider both small vesicles and tubules
as products of membrane curvature generation.30 Consistent with Figure 5, BIN1-FL produces
membrane curvature only on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. Curvature
induction by BIN1-FL at low ionic strength predominantly leads to
vesiculation. As shown in the boxed area in Figure 6C, uniformly sized vesicles were formed after incubating BIN1-FL
with (+) PI(4,5)P2 liposomes. However, vesiculation and
tubulation are rarely seen in the (−) PI(4,5)P2 sample.
Preincubation of the PRD peptide with full-length protein effectively
increased the number of both membrane tubules and vesiculated liposomes
in the (−) PI(4,5)P2 sample. To obtain a quantitative
evaluation of BIN1 activation achieved by association with PRD peptides,
the percentages of three morphological groups are plotted in Figure 6C. Over 90% of the membrane morphologies induced
by BIN1 from the (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes belong to vesiculation,
while more than 80% of the events are intact vesicles in the case
of (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. Co-incubation with PRD
peptides resulted in an enhancement of tubulation and vesiculation
abilities of BIN1-FL and a decrease in the occurrence of intact vesicles
for membranes lacking PI(4,5)P2.

To summarize, we
demonstrated that adding PRD peptides activates
both curvature sensing and curvature generation capacity of BIN1,
in agreement with our autoinhibition model. The key to activate BIN1
membrane remodeling ability is to dissociate the exon10–SH3
mediated inhibitory complex. Our model indicates a regulation/activation
mechanism in BIN1 through plasma membrane localization and protein–protein
interactions.

Analogue of PI(4,5)P2 Headgroup
Releases the Inhibited
Membrane Curvature Sensing Ability of BIN1 on (−) PI(4,5)P2 Membranes
So far, we have shown that PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane, or the association with an SH3 domain ligand,
activates BIN1 MC-S&amp;G. To further support this finding, we asked
if addition of a water-soluble PI(4,5)P2 analogue leads
to release of BIN1 autoinhibition on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. We chose d-myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)
as an analogue of the PI(4,5)P2 headgroup. We used ITC
to find out if IP3 is able to bind to the exon10 motif and to determine
the corresponding affinity. The binding between exon10 peptide and
IP3 is dependent on ionic strength. The averaged Kd of exon10 binding with IP3 in 0 mM NaCl buffer is 1.02
± 0.1 μM, while the Kd in 50
mM NaCl buffer is 5.6 ± 0.8 μM (Figure 7A). At physiological ionic strength, the Kd was too high to be obtainable by ITC, implying that
the interaction between exon10 peptides and IP3 molecules is dominated
by electrostatic interactions. Since the salt concentration used for
the curvature sensing assay was 50 mM, we chose to carry out curvature
sensing measurements in the presence of 20 μM IP3 (around four
times higher than Kd at this ionic strength)
and 40 nM BIN1-FL incubated with (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes.
If IP3 were able to dissociate exon10 from the SH3 domain, then a
release in autoinhibition would be expected. Indeed, we observed an
enhancement of protein localization on the membrane tether. The partitioning
ratio Ir/Ir0 is observed to
always be higher compared to BIN1-FL alone on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes (Figure 7B). However, the
released curvature sensing ability (as indicated by the slope in Figure 7B) is weaker in the presence of IP3 than in the
case of the BIN1-FL protein alone on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes
(Figure 3C). There are two possible explanations
for the partially released curvature sensing function. First, membrane
binding of exon10 may be required to fully release the MC-S&amp;G
capacity of BIN1. Second, it is reasonable to assume that the binding
affinity of exon10 motif with membranous PI(4,5)P2 is stronger
than with IP3. This is a common effect for protein–membrane
interactions that are enhanced by proximity, local ionic strength,
and favorable orientation achieved on the surface of membranes.48−50

Figure 7 IP3
(water-soluble analogue of PI(4,5)P2 headgroup)
binds to exon10 motif and releases membrane curvature sensing ability.
(A) In vitro binding affinity between exon10 and
IP3 was characterized by the ITC measurement in which 500 μM
exon10 peptides were added to 25 μM IP3 in buffer containing
0 mM or 50 mM NaCl. The interaction between exon10 peptide and IP3
was significantly affected by solution ionic strength. (B) Membrane
curvature sensing assay was performed by mixing 20 μM IP3 with
40 nM BIN1-FL and (−) PI(4,5)P2 GUVs in Hepes, 50
mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer.

CNM-Related SH3 Domain Truncation Abolishes BIN1 Autoinhibition
Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a congenital myopathy with abnormal
cell nuclei displacement in skeletal muscles.12,51,52 Mutations in the human BIN1 gene have been
shown to cause CNM. Three single point mutations in the BAR domain
region have been shown to interfere with the membrane tubulation capacity
of BIN1 and to lead to disorganized T-tubules.53−56 Two additional nonsense mutations
were found to be located in the C-terminal SH3 domain.54,56 Previous studies have suggested that CNM-related mutations in the
SH3 domain disrupt the binding interface with proline-rich sequences
and interfere with the ability to recruit dynamin 2. In fact, cellular
experiments showed that the colocalization of BIN1 C-terminal mutants
and dynamin 2 were decreased relative to BIN1-FL.56 Because the SH3 domain binding interface for exon10 overlaps
with that for the proline-rich domain,11 we asked how the disease mutation at the SH3 domain C-terminus affects
the autoinhibitory interaction with exon10.

First, to test if
the SH3 domain bearing the CNM-associated mutation K436X can bind
to exon10, we performed ITC measurements in which exon10 peptide (500
μM) was added to GST-SH3-K436X mutant (50 μM). Limited
and constant amounts of heat were generated during the titration (Figure 8A). The ITC titration profile is similar to a control
where exon10 peptides were titrated into pure buffer (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Compared
to Figure 2B, we conclude that the truncation
mutant K436X compromised the binding between SH3 domain and exon10
motif. We hypothesize that the deletion of the C-terminus disrupts
the interface responsible for recruiting both exon10 motif and PRD
peptide.

Figure 8 Autoinhibition is absent in the disease mutant K436X. Membrane
recruitment of PRD peptide is enhanced by PI(4,5)P2. (A)
ITC measurement of titrating 500 μM exon10 peptide to 50 μM
GST-SH3-K436X mutant indicates no detectable binding. Buffer: 20 mM
Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4. (B) Electron micrographs of BIN1-FL-K436X
mutants with LUVs (±) PI(4,5)P2. K436X mutant is able
to induce membrane tubules from liposomes lacking PI(4,5)P2, implying that curvature generation capacity of K436X mutant is
not regulated by PI(4,5)P2. Scale bar: 200 nm. (C) Confocal
fluorescence images of 2 μM rhodamine labeled PRD peptide only,
or 2 μM PRD peptides mixed with 2 μM Alex488 labeled BIN1-FL,
BIN1-FL-K436X, or N-BAR* on vesicles (±) PI(4,5)P2. All images show the rhodamine channel under the excitation only
by the 543 nm laser. BIN1-FL, but neither K436X mutant nor N-BAR*
domain, is able to recruit dynamin 2 derived PRD peptide to the membrane.
Scale bar: 5 μm. (D) Quantifications of the PRD fluorescence
intensities (F.I.) in the absence/presence of BIN1-FL or BIN1-FL-K436X
on (±) PI(4,5)P2 vesicles. Comparison of the PRD fluorescence
intensities in the presence of 2 μM BIN1-FL or BIN1-FL-K436X
on vesicle (±) PI(4,5)P2 was tested by Student’s t-test. (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes show significantly
enhanced membrane density of PRD peptides. n.s.: p &gt; 0.05; ***: p &lt; 0.005.

If the truncated SH3 domain is unable to associate with the
exon10
motif, one would expect the autoinhibitory effect on the membrane
curvature sensing and generation ability to vanish for this mutant.
To test this hypothesis, tubulation assays were performed by incubating
the CNM mutant K436X with liposomes with or without PI(4,5)P2. In contrast to WT BIN1-FL, where tubulation was inhibited on (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes, tubulation was observed in both cases,
independent of PI(4,5)P2 (Figure 8B). This observation further supports the autoinhibition model in
BIN1, which requires not only the co-presence but also the integrity
of each binding partner.

Dynamin 2 is a large GTPase with diverse
roles in cellular functions.
Mutations in dynamin 2 contribute to deficits at the sarcotubular
network indicating that misregulation of dynamin 2 leads to the pathogenesis
of neuromuscular diseases.57,58 Membrane recruitment
of dynamin 2 via BIN1 is critical for healthy muscle development.56 The SH3 domain is the module responsible for
recruiting dynamin 2 by the interaction with PRD domains. We asked
how autoinhibition of BIN1 can modulate the recruitment of downstream
signaling molecules and whether activation of membrane remodeling
and downstream ligand recruitment act in synergy.

To answer
this question, we synthesized a rhodamine-labeled PRD
peptide and incubated it with GUVs in the presence or absence of BIN1
variants. The PRD peptide itself does not bind to (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes in 50 mM NaCl (Figure 8C).
Contrarily, on GUVs preincubated with 2 μM BIN1-FL (labeled
with Alexa488 dye), significant enhancement of rhodamine fluorescence
was observed (Figure 8C). Of note, images of
vesicles were obtained at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm. To exclude
bleed-through from Alexa488 into the rhodamine channel, imaging parameters
(illumination intensity and detector settings) were carefully selected.
In contrast to BIN1-FL, the disease mutant K436X is incapable of recruiting
PRD peptides to the membranes (Figure 8C),
consistent with the decreased dynamin 2 localization on BIN1-positive
tubules in cells.56 This supports the hypothesis
that the PRD binding interface is disrupted in the truncation mutant.
As a negative control, the coincubation with BIN1 N-BAR* domain failed
to bind PRD peptides as well (Figure 8C), confirming
that the recruitment of the PRD domain requires the presence and integrity
of the SH3 domain.

To further understand the influence of phosphoinositides
on dynamin
2 membrane recruitment, we repeated the PRD recruitment assay on (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes. We argue that the presence of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane will compete with the SH3 domain to bind
to the exon10 motif and increase the availability of the SH3 domain
for PRD recruitment. Similarly, the PRD peptide does not bind to (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes on its own. Indeed, the signal of PRD
peptides recruited by BIN1-FL on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes
is weaker than on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes (Figure 8C). However, no PRD peptide is recruited to (−)
PI(4,5)P2 membranes via either the BIN1-FL-K436X mutant
or the N-BAR* domain, as expected. We quantified PRD fluorescence
at the membrane for each experimental condition. The decrease in the
PRD membrane recruitment on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes
via BIN1 is statistically significant (Figure 8D). Little PRD peptide is recruited by the K436X mutant to the membrane
regardless of the lipid composition, further confirming that the functional
SH3 domain is the key factor for recruiting downstream ligands. The
weaker PRD membrane recruitment on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes not only supports the autoinhibition model but also implies
a synergistic regulation of BIN1 function through exon10-PI(4,5)P2, and SH3 domain-ligand binding.

Phosphoinositides Slow
BIN1 Diffusion on the Membrane
Protein oligomerization on
membranes is an important mechanism contributing
to MC-S&amp;G by peripheral proteins.44 It has been shown that BAR domain proteins form lattice-like coats
on tubular membranes.59 Protein oligomerization
can amplify MC-S&amp;G.60 To ask whether
the activation of BIN1 MC-S&amp;G on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes
might be caused by effective protein assembly, we characterized the
lateral diffusion of BIN1-FL on (±) PI(4,5)P2 membranes
via the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) method.
BIN1-FL showed fluorescence recovery in the bleached region on both
membrane compositions (Figure S3A, Supporting
Information). However, the averaged recovery half-time t1/2 of BIN1 on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes is 2.5-fold slower than that on (−) PI(4,5)P2 membranes. The averaged mobile fractions on (±) PI(4,5)P2 membranes are not significantly different (Figure S3B–D). Recently, Lappalainen et al. reported
that the F-BAR protein syp1 can induce PI(4,5)P2 clusters,
which act as hot spots for protein oligomeric assembly.61 Consequently, the lateral diffusion of proteins
on membranes is inhibited. It is likely that the slower BIN1-FL diffusion
on membranes with PI(4,5)P2 is caused by protein oligomerization.
This assumption is consistent with the observation that a BAR domain
mutant inefficient in oligomerization diffuses faster on the membrane.61 The formation of oligomerized BIN1 networks
on (+) PI(4,5)P2 membranes might lead to enhanced MC-S&amp;G.

Discussion
One of the major findings of the present contribution
is that the
exon10 motif and C-terminal SH3 domain serve dual roles in regulating
the function of BIN1. The exon10 motif causes autoinhibition via association
with the SH3 domain and allows for membrane modulation by targeting
PI(4,5)P2. Similarly, the SH3 domain has two functions:
autoinhibition and ligand recruitment. Autoinhibition is a regulatory
mechanism found in other BAR domain proteins as well. It has been
reported that various inputs work synergistically to regulate membrane
localization and functional activation.20,24 One example
is the F-BAR domain protein syndapin1, which can form a molecular
clamp between SH3 and BAR domain that leads to a compact, autoinhibited
conformation unable to generate membrane curvature.20,59 The activation of syndapin requires the binding of dynamin to the
SH3 domain to induce an open conformation.20,46 Such coupling between membrane curvature generation and dynamin
recruitment was also found for endophilin/amphiphysin.16 In fact, a great number of peripheral proteins
contain domains, such as the SH3 domain, specialized for the recruitment
of downstream ligands. Autoinhibition mediated by SH3 domains is also
found in the cytoskeletal proteins N-WASP and IRSp53.24,62,63 Intramolecular autoinhibition
and simultaneous activation by specific membrane localization and
ligand recruitment may be a general mechanism for proteins to control
their function.

The autoinhibition model that we propose for
BIN1 is shown schematically
in Figure 9. BIN1 is in an inhibited state
via the interaction between PI(4,5)P2 sensing motif exon10
and SH3 domain, consistent with an earlier study showing that the
exon10 peptide binds to the SH3 domain in a region overlapping with
the binding interface of the proline-rich domain.11 In the autoinhibited state, exon10 is masked from interacting
with the membrane, and ligand recruitment through the SH3 domain is
impaired. We showed that in the autoinhibited state, BIN1 still binds
to, but cannot reshape the membrane. Upon membrane association, the
local membrane composition becomes critical in determining if BIN1
is active or not. Particularly, PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane
plays an important role in releasing autoinhibition. On membranes
where PI(4,5)P2 is absent, BIN1 remains in a resting state,
unable to sense and induce curvature (Figure 3 and 5). However, the presence of PI(4,5)P2 in the membrane attracts exon10 away from the autoinhibitory
interaction. This may explain the observation that T-tubules are enriched
in PI(4,5)P2 and that production of BIN1 and PI(4,5)P2 during the differentiation of C2C12 cells is upregulated.10 In addition to functional regulation by phosphoinositides,
the binding of SH3 domain ligands to BIN1 results in activation of
membrane remodeling (Figure 6). The synergy
of the SH3 domain binding to other proteins along with membrane localization
through PI(4,5)P2 might be important for T-tubule biogenesis.
Such cooperativity has also been reported for other BAR domain proteins
with regard to their binding to dynamin and AP-2/clathrin in endocytosis.64

Figure 9 Proposed schematic illustration of how membrane composition
and
protein–ligand interaction cooperatively regulate membrane
remodeling function of BIN1. BIN1-FL protein rests in a closed conformation
through the interaction between SH3 and exon10 motifs. Exon10 is prevented
from the interaction with membrane. Upon association with the membrane
lacking PI(4,5)P2, BIN1-FL protein is still blocked in
the inactive state unable to sense or induce membrane deformation.
Binding with PI(4,5)P2 or the PRD containing proteins,
such as dynamin 2 can induce an conformational change in BIN1 and
activate MC-S&amp;G. However, the CNM-related nonsense mutation disturbs
the autoinhibitory interaction leading to an unregulated membrane
modulation.

Moreover, we provided
new insights into how CNM-related disease
mutations in SH3 domain contribute to pathogenesis mechanisms (Figure 9). In vivo cellular experiments
have suggested that the nonsense mutation in the SH3 domain compromised
the recruitment of dynamin 2.56 Our results
not only support this claim but also show that the disease-related
truncation of the SH3 domain interferes with autoinhibition through
compromised binding to exon10 (Figure 8A).
Consequently, the curvature sensing and generation ability of the
K436X mutant is no longer regulated by PI(4,5)P2 (Figure 8B). It can be hypothesized that active BIN1 adopts
an open conformation favorable for membrane interaction. This assumption
is supported by the finding that C-terminal disease mutants bind myotubularin
(MTM1) more efficiently due to an increased accessibility of the MTM1
binding site in the open conformation.65 Such conformational change is induced by the loss of the exon10–SH3
interaction. In summary, membrane remodeling by BIN1 is a synergistic
process that involves correct membrane localization and ligand binding.
It requires cooperative spatial and temporal assembly of proteins
to precisely regulate the membrane deformation.
