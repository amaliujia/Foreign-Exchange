Mammalian
nitric oxide synthases
(NOSs) require the cofactor (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin
(H4B) to convert l-arginine to l-citrulline and nitric oxide,, an important second-messenger molecule in neural and cardiovascular
systems. The mammalian NOS enzyme family
consists of three isoforms, neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS),
and endothelial NOS (eNOS). Each isoform
is active only as a homodimer because the pterin binding site is located
right at the dimer interface and monomeric NOS does not bind H4B or the substrate. The dimer
interface is formed between two N-terminal heme binding oxygenase
domains that is further stabilized by the coordination of a Zn2+ ion ligated to two cysteine thiols from each subunit (ZnS4), (Figure ). H4B plays the role of a redox active one-electron donor that
activates the heme-bound O2, resulting in the formation
of an H4B radical. With l-Arg as the substrate, this radical is then re-reduced by obtaining
an electron from the ferrous NO complex generated at the end of the
catalytic reaction, thus allowing the release of NO from the ferric
heme., All NOS isoforms share a strikingly similar
pterin binding pocket with comparable H4B binding affinities,
and cofactor and substrate binding events have been shown to synergistically
stabilize the NOS dimer.− Low-temperature sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
and urea dissociation studies indicate that the relative dimer strengths
of the three mammalian NOS isoforms decrease from eNOS to nNOS to
iNOS and that the role of H4B in dimer stability is less
critical in eNOS., The structural basis for this
disparity, however, is not yet fully understood.

the bovine eNOS dimer in complex with H4B (Protein Data
Bank entry 9NSE). The Zn2+ binding site is
located at the dimer interface and ∼15 Å from the center
of the pterin binding pocket in both molecules A and B of the dimer.
Chain A is colored green, chain B yellow, pterin blue, and heme orange.
All structural figures were prepared with PyMol (http://www.pymol.org).

One way of exploring the relationship
between dimer stability and
H4B binding is to investigate the pterin binding pocket
using various pterin analogues. Moreover, inactive pterin analogues
could potentially serve as NOS inhibitors,− and have proven to be useful in probing the function
of H4B.− In this study, we have determined the crystal structures of three
novel pterin compounds (Figure ) analogous
to H4B bound to eNOS, which has unexpectedly provided important
insights into the intimate connection among the Zn2+, pterin,
and substrate binding sites.

Materials and Methods
Protein Expression and Purification
The bovine holo-eNOS
pCWori construct containing an AmpR gene and an N-terminal six-His tag was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells already containing the
calmodulin plasmid (with a ChlR gene), and the cells were then plated on LB agar with ampicillin
(100 μg/mL) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/mL). E.
coli cells inherently lack the machinery to synthesize H4B, ensuring that eNOS would remain free of H4B.
A single colony was used to inoculate each 5 mL of LB starter culture
(100 μg/mL ampicillin and 35 μg/mL chloramphenicol). The
culture was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with 220 rpm agitation.
Each liter of TB medium (100 μg/mL ampicillin and 35 μg/mL
chloramphenicol) was inoculated with 2 mL of LB starter culture. The
cells were grown at 37 °C with agitation at 220 rpm until the
OD (600 nm) reached 1.0–1.2. Protein expression was then induced
by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside and
0.4 mM δ-aminolevulinic acid. New doses of ampicillin and chloramphenicol
were also added, and cell growth resumed at 25 °C and 100 rpm
for 24 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation and stored
at −80 °C.

Cells were thawed and resuspended by
being stirred for 3 h at 4 °C in buffer A [50 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 7.8), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM l-Arg, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 200 mM NaCl]. The
following protease inhibitors were added to buffer A before lysis:
trypsin inhibitor (5 μg/mL), pepstatin A (1 μg/mL), and
leupeptin (1 μg/mL). Cells were lysed by being passed through
a microfluidizer at 18K psi (Microfluidics International Co.). The
soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 17000 rpm and 4
°C for 1 h. The crude extract was then loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate column pre-equilibrated with 10 bed volumes of
buffer A. After being loaded with the crude extract, the column was
washed with 10 bed volumes of 10 mM imidazole in buffer A before being
eluted with a 10 to 200 mM imidazole linear gradient in buffer A.
Colored fractions were pooled and loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP
Sepharose column pre-equilibrated with buffer B [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.8), 10% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.5
mM l-Arg, and 200 mM NaCl]. The column was then washed with
10 bed volumes of buffer B and eluted with 10 mM NADP+ in
buffer B. Colored fractions were pooled and concentrated in a 30000
molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) Amicon concentrator at 4 °C. The
eNOS heme domain used for crystallization was generated by limited
trypsinolysis: a 20:1 eNOS:trypsin weight ratio was used for a 1 h
incubation at 25 °C. The digested sample was then loaded onto
a Superdex 200 column (HiLoad 26/60, GE Healthcare) controlled by
an FPLC system and pre-equilibrated with buffer B to separate the
heme domain and flavin-containing fragment generated by the trypsin
digest. Fractions were pooled according to an A280/A395 spectral ratio of &lt;1.7,
and sample homogeneity was determined by SDS–PAGE.

H2B Analogues
The preparation
of pterin compounds 6-acetyl-2-amino-7,7-dimethyl-7,8-dihydro-4(3H)-pteridinone (1 in Figure ), 2-amino-9a-methyl-6,7,8,9,9a,10-hexahydrobenzo[g]pteridin-4(3H)-one (2),
and 2-amino-9a-methyl-8,9,9a,10-tetrahydrobenzo[g]pteridine-4,6(3H,7H)-dione (3) used in this study has been previously described.,

Crystal Preparation
All eNOS heme domain samples were
prepared for crystallization by being concentrated to 12 mg/mL in
buffer B using a 30000 MWCO Amicon concentrator. Cocrystallization
was conducted by combining protein with 5 mM cofactor and 5 mM l-arginine. Crystals were grown at 4 °C in 18–20%
PEG 3350 (w/v), 250 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM cacodylate (pH 6.25),
and 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in a sitting-drop vapor
diffusion setup. Freshly grown crystals were passed stepwise through
a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% PEG 3350, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
10% (w/v) trehalose, 5% (w/v) sucrose, 5% (w/v) mannitol, 10 mM cofactor,
and 5–10 mM l-Arg for 4–6 h at 4 °C before
being flash-cooled with liquid nitrogen.

X-ray Diffraction Data
Collection, Processing, and Structure
Refinement
Cryogenic (100 K) X-ray diffraction data were
collected remotely at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL)
using the data collection control software Blu-Ice and a crystal mounting robot. An ADSC Q315r CCD detector
at beamline 7-1 or a Mar325 CCD detector at beamline 9-2 was used
for data collection. Raw data frames were indexed, integrated, and
scaled using HKL2000. The binding of
H4B cofactors was detected by the initial difference Fourier
maps calculated with REFMAC. The pterin
molecules were then modeled in COOT and
refined using REFMAC. Water molecules were added in REFMAC and checked
by COOT. The TLS protocol was implemented
in the final stage of refinements with each subunit as one TLS group.
The refined structures were validated in COOT before being deposited
in the Protein Data Bank. The crystallographic data collection and
structure refinement statistics are listed in Table  with Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry codes included.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterization
of the H4B Binding Pocket
As shown in Figure , the three dihydropterin
analogues retain the ring structure of H4B and introduce
variations only in the side chain. Figure  shows the electron density of the three dihydropterin analogues
bound to eNOS. Compound 1 (Figure A) exhibits the strongest and most well-defined electron density.
As expected from its structural similarity to H4B, compound 1 fits into the pterin binding pocket quite well, maintaining
most of the interactions found with H4B: the π–π
stacking with W449, the H-bonds from its 2-aminopyrimidine nitrogens
to the heme propionate A, the H-bond from O4 to R367, and the van
der Waals contacts with aromatic residues of the other subunits (W76
and F462). Therefore, it is not surprising that the tetrahydro form
of 1 can support the conversion of l-arginine
to NO in nNOS. From kinetic studies,
the estimated KD for 1 is
115 μM compared to a value of 1.1 μM for H4B.

(A) Active site of bovine eNOS in complex
with pterin analogue 1 with the 2Fo – Fc electron density
map contoured at 1.0σ.
The strong density supports binding to the pterin site even though
the compound lacks the ability to form a hydrogen bond with Ser104
of chain A. (B and C) Active site of bovine eNOS in complex with 2 and 3, respectively, with the 2Fo – Fc density map
contoured at 1.0σ. The density for 2 is not as
strong as that for analogue 1 but supports binding of 2 with the extra methyl facing F462, while the density for 3 is weaker than that for 1 or 2 yet strong enough to support binding of 3 in the shown
orientation. (D) Active site of bovine eNOS in complex with pterin
analogue 1 as shown in panel A but overlaid with the
2Fo – Fc map (1.0σ) calculated using the data collected with a crystal
supplemented with 50 μM Zn acetate during the cryoprotectant
soaks. The poorly defined pterin and substrate density at best supports
partial occupancy. The color scheme for this figure and Figure  is as follows: Chain A is colored green, chain
B yellow, pterin blue, substrate l-arginine cyan, and the
heme orange.

However, the two additional
H-bonds from the dihydroxypropyl side
chain of H4B to the carbonyls of S104 and F462 are lost
in 1. Unique to 1 is the close contact from
one of its methyl groups at the C7 position to the W447 side chain
of the other subunit. Both 2 and 3 in the
dihydro oxidation state introduce a third cyclohexane ring to replace
the H4B side chain. Although the third ring is tolerated
by the pterin binding pocket, the extra methyl group at C7 may generate
steric clashes with the protein. As a result, 2 (Figure B) and 3 (Figure C) exhibit weaker electron density. Crystals of the eNOS–3 complex diffract poorly, which we have found correlates
well with poor ligand binding. Because 3 is structurally
similar to 2 and differs only in the carbonyl O atom
on the cyclohexane ring, the additional steric crowding of this oxygen
in 3 very likely accounts for why this pterin analogue
binds more poorly. Overall, the inability of the three pterin analogues
to form hydrogen bonds with S104 and F462 and the steric clashes from
their protruding methyl groups may be attributed to a binding affinity
that is poorer than that of the native pterin, H4B.

Disruption
of the Zn2+ Binding Site
As shown
in Figure , a single Zn2+ ion is
situated at the dimer interface where it is tetrahedrally coordinated
by symmetry-related Cys residues along the dimer axis. The Zn2+ is ∼15 Å from the center of the pterin binding
pocket in both subunits A and B of the dimer. Quite unexpectedly,
we found that the binding of 1 completely disrupts the
Zn2+ binding region, as evidenced by a total lack of electron
density for residues 91–109 and the Zn2+ (Figure A). It has been known for some time that both Zn2+ and H4B contribute to dimer stability,,, but this is the first indication
that there is a relatively long-range communication between these
two sites. To probe whether the binding of 1 and the
binding of Zn2+ are mutually exclusive, we soaked crystals
of the eNOS–1 complex in a cryoprotectant solution
supplemented with 50 μM Zn acetate. The crystal structure shows
that Zn2+ binding is restored (Figure D), while the electron density for 1 and the
substrate, l-Arg, are poorly defined (Figure D). We next soaked crystals at a more moderate Zn acetate
concentration of 20 μM. In this case, 1 and l-Arg bind well but the Zn2+ site is disordered (data
not shown). In contrast, binding of 2 and binding of 3 do not interfere with Zn2+ binding (Figure B,C). The interdependence of pterin and l-Arg binding is well-known and is very likely mediated by the fact
H4B H-bonds to the same heme propionate as the α-amino
group of l-Arg (Figure ).−

a reference bovine eNOS structure with bound H4B and an
ordered Zn2+ site (PDB entry 9NSE). This is to illustrate the disordered
Zn2+ site resulting from binding of compound 1 to the pterin pocket. The lack of electron density spans residues
91–109 in chain A and residues 91–111 in chain B. (B
and C) Zn2+ binding site of bovine eNOS in complex with 2 and 3, respectively. The 2Fo – Fc density map
is at a contour level of 1.0σ and shows a fully ordered Zn2+ site, supporting undisrupted Zn2+ binding. (D)

with 50 μM Zn acetate. The Zn2+ site is fully ordered,
while compound 1 is disordered in structure.

How Does the Pterin Site Communicate with
the Zn2+ Site?
These results clearly show that
there is a strong
long-range communication between the Zn2+, pterin, and
substrate binding sites. To explain why, we next conducted a detailed
comparison between the eNOS–1 complex with a disordered
Zn2+ and the fully ordered eNOS structure with H4B bound. By superposition of the α-carbon backbone of chains
A (Figure B), we see that chain B has shifted
away by a significant distance. For comparison, we next superposed
H4B-bound to H4B-free eNOS structures (Figure A) and did the same for bound structures of 2 (Figure C) and 3 (Figure D). In these cases, chain B does not move significantly
relative to chain A. For the sake of consistency, we superposed the
α-carbon backbone of chain B and observed a similar shift in
chain A. To further quantify the observation, we calculated the root-mean-square
deviations (rmsds) of chains A and B for residues 121–482 in
each pair of structures. For the eNOS–1 complex
superposed on the basis of only chain A with an H4B-bound
eNOS reference structure (PDB entry 9NSE), the rmsd of chain B is 1.23 Å,
compared to the values of 0.27–0.44 Å calculated with
the same method against the same reference structure for either an
H4B-free structure or other pterin analogue structures
that do not disrupt the Zn2+ site (Table ).

four panels, the superposition was conducted in Coot only on chain
A of both structures to observe the relative deviation in chain B.
The color scheme is as follows. For the H4B-bound structure,
chain A is colored yellow and chain B green. For the H4B-free or pterin analogue-bound structures, chain A is colored red
and chain B blue. (B–D) Superposition of an H4B-bound

Chain A of each structure was superposed
with chain A of H4B-bound eNOS (PDB entry 9NSE), and all rmsds
were calculated using LSQMAN (http://xray.bmc.uu.se/usf/).

A close examination
of the eNOS–1 structure
reveals that chain B moves away from chain A because of the methyl
groups on C7 of 1 (Figure B).
Accommodating these methyl substituents forces W447 of chain B to
shift away from chain A. The shift of W447 is not merely absorbed
locally, but instead induces a global change in the entire chain B
as a rigid body. The repulsion between the methyl group of 1 and W447 occurs in a symmetrical manner in both subunits, resulting
in the slight opening of the dimer interface. The widened dimer interface
causes disruption of key backbone contacts between the Cys-bearing
Zn2+ binding hairpin fragment (residues 95–102)
that includes contacts between C101 and N468 (Figure B). Loss of those key interactions leads to the total disordering
of the Zn2+ binding site. Comparatively, the H4B-free eNOS structure (Figure A) and those
in complexes with 2 (Figure C)
and 3 (Figure D) show practically
no shift of W447. The extra methyl group in 2 and 3 is not directly pointing to W477, causing no disruption
of the dimer interface. In the same way, we also compared the H4B-bound eNOS structure to the structure of the eNOS–1 complex supplemented with 50 μM Zn2+ giving
a restored Zn2+ site, and the resulting superposition shows
a tighter dimer (Figure A) and a restored
W447 position (Figure B) at the expense of
weakened binding of 1 (Figure D). It also should be noted that residues directly contacting H4B, W447, W449, and F462, are conserved in both nNOS and eNOS.

structures, chain A is colored red and chain B blue. H4B is colored cyan, the pterin analogue purple, and the heme orange.

For the pterin analogue-bound form, chain A is colored red and chain
B blue. H4B is colored cyan, the pterin analogue purple,
and the heme orange.

What Does This Communication Reveal about the NOS Dimer?
These results reveal that the eNOS dimer is able to loosen up and
expand to accommodate 1. The side effect is that all
hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the Zn2+ binding
site, mainly the two between N468 and C101, are weakened or lost,
as shown in Figure . This effect being compounded
on both chains causes a complete disruption of Zn2+ binding
and destabilization of the dimer.

Previous studies have shown
that eNOS has the most stable dimer compared to nNOS and iNOS. To obtain NOS–pterin complexes, it is
necessary to purify NOS in the absence of H4B and only
eNOS, not nNOS, is stable enough without H4B during purification
and the proteolysis required to generate the heme domain for crystallization.
Two attempts were made to purify nNOS with pterin-free buffer or the
buffer supplemented with 1, but the protein denatured
completely upon trypsinolysis required for generating the heme domain.
This very likely reflects the fact that the eNOS dimer is more stable
than nNOS: it can survive purification without H4B bound
and can bind 1 without disruption of the dimer. This
also suggests that the combination of intersubunit contacts attributed
to the greater dimer strength of eNOS allows it to survive disruption
of the Zn2+ site without complete disruption of the dimer.

Summary
Even though the importance of H4B in
stabilizing the
NOS dimer has been known for some time, this study provides the structural
basis for the intimate structural communication among H4B, Zn2+, substrate binding, and dimer stability. It is
important to note that zinc-free NOS retains near full catalytic activity,
although the dimer is substantially less stable. A number of biochemical studies,− have shown that the main role of the zinc site is to promote H4B binding, which in turn increases the affinity for the substrate, l-Arg. The study presented here provides a structural basis
for this interdependence. We were fortunate that the additional stability
of the eNOS dimer allowed us to probe perturbations at the dimer interface
without totally disrupting the dimer, which would preclude any detailed
crystallographic analysis as in the case of nNOS. It is remarkable
that the mere addition of the methyl groups in 1 can
have such a dramatic effect on the Zn2+ site. This underscores
the exquisite fine-tuning of interactions that stabilize the NOS dimer
and the close interdependence of the Zn2+, pterin, and
substrate binding sites.
