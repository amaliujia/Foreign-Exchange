Phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PheH), a liver enzyme that catalyzes
the hydroxylation of excess phenylalanine in the diet to tyrosine,
is activated by phenylalanine. The lack of activity at low levels
of phenylalanine has been attributed to the N-terminus of the protein’s
regulatory domain acting as an inhibitory peptide by blocking substrate
access to the active site. The location of the site at which phenylalanine
binds to activate the enzyme is unknown, and both the active site
in the catalytic domain and a separate site in the N-terminal regulatory
domain have been proposed. Binding of catecholamines to the active-site
iron was used to probe the accessibility of the active site. Removal
of the regulatory domain increases the rate constants for association
of several catecholamines with the wild-type enzyme by ∼2-fold.
Binding of phenylalanine in the active site is effectively abolished
by mutating the active-site residue Arg270 to lysine. The kcat/Kphe value is
down 104 for the mutant enzyme, and the Km value for phenylalanine for the mutant enzyme is &gt;0.5
M. Incubation of the R270K enzyme with phenylalanine also results
in a 2-fold increase in the rate constants for catecholamine binding.
The change in the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum seen in
the wild-type enzyme upon activation by phenylalanine is also seen
with the R270K mutant enzyme in the presence of phenylalanine. Both
results establish that activation of PheH by phenylalanine does not
require binding of the amino acid in the active site. This is consistent
with a separate allosteric site, likely in the regulatory domain.

Phenylalanine
hydroxylase (PheH)
catalyzes the first step in the catabolism of excess phenylalanine
in the diet, its hydroxylation to tyrosine. The enzyme activity in
the liver responds in a cooperative fashion to phenylalanine concentrations,
with low activity at basal concentrations of phenylalanine and increased
activity when the concentration of phenylalanine in the blood rises.1 The molecular basis for this behavior is not
well-understood.2 The initial rate of formation
of tyrosine by purified PheH is very low unless the enzyme is first
incubated with phenylalanine.3 The phenylalanine-activated
enzyme displays positive cooperativity with phenylalanine as the substrate,
with a Hill coefficient of ∼2,4 consistent
with additional cooperative interactions between different active
sites. The enzyme can also be phosphorylated on Ser16; this decreases
the concentration of phenylalanine required for activation.5,6 On the basis of extensive studies of the kinetics of activation
of liver PheH under a variety of conditions, Shiman and co-workers7 proposed a model for the regulation of the enzyme.
Key features of the model are that the resting form of the enzyme
has little activity and that activation by phenylalanine is associated
with a change in the active-site structure, allowing productive binding
of substrates. The site at which phenylalanine binds to activate the
enzyme was proposed to be distinct from the active site.8

The initial sequencing of PheH and the
related aromatic amino acid
hydroxylases tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase allowed the identification
of two structural domains in these proteins, a homologous C-terminal
catalytic domain and a variable N-terminal domain.9 Subsequent analyses of mutant proteins established that
the N-terminal domains are responsible for the divergent regulatory
properties of the enzymes, while the C-terminal catalytic domains
are responsible for substrate specificity10,11 and contain a C-terminal helix responsible for oligomerization.12−14 The crystal structure of a mutant form of rat PheH lacking the 24
C-terminal residues confirmed the presence of discrete regulatory
and catalytic domains and provided a structural rationale for phenylalanine
activation.15,16 In this structure, the N-terminus
of the regulatory domain lies across the active site of the enzyme,
partially occluding it (Figure 1). This observation
led to the proposal that the conformational change that occurs upon
activation by phenylalanine involves the displacement of this N-terminal
tail, allowing access of substrates to the active site. Recently,
Jaffe et al.17 proposed a structural model
for the activated enzyme in which the regulatory domains dimerize.

The active-site iron is colored orange.

There is no structure of PheH containing the regulatory domain
that also has bound phenylalanine, leaving the location of the allosteric
site unknown. Kobe et al.15 identified
a possible site in the regulatory domain for phenylalanine based on
their observation that the regulatory domain of PheH has a fold similar
to that of the regulatory domain in 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
that contains an allosteric site for serine.18 The same fold was subsequently identified in a number of other allosteric
proteins and termed an ACT domain.19−21 More recently, Li et
al.22 reported that addition of phenylalanine
to the isolated regulatory domain of PheH altered the elution of the
protein from a gel filtration column and changed the chemical shifts
in a nuclear magnetic resonance heteronuclear single-quantum coherence
spectrum of the protein, providing evidence of a phenylalanine binding
site in the regulatory domain. Subsequently, Zhang et al.23 reported that binding of phenylalanine to the
isolated regulatory domain is linked to its dimerization, as predicted
by the model proposed by Jaffe et al.17 In contrast, Thorolfsson et al.,24 based
on the application of calorimetry to intact and truncated proteins,
concluded that phenylalanine activation involves binding only in the
active site. Flydal et al.25 reported that
PheH from Caenorhabditis elegans has a Hill coefficient
of 0.9 and is thus not cooperative but will bind two molecules of
phenylalanine per subunit. Mutation of two residues in the catalytic
domain of this protein to those found in human PheH decreased the
stoichiometry of phenylalanine binding and increased the Hill coefficient
to 1.4. These authors concluded that interactions with the catalytic
domain prevent binding of phenylalanine to the regulatory domains
of the mammalian enzymes and that this closure of the site in the
regulatory domain is required for cooperativity.

Clearly, knowledge
of the identity of any regulatory site for phenylalanine
is critical to understanding the structural basis for regulation of
PheH.2 To address the question of whether
activation of PheH by phenylalanine involves binding of the amino
acid to an allosteric site outside of the catalytic site, we have
now characterized the effects of binding of phenylalanine to a mutant
PheH in which binding of the amino acid in the active site has been
abolished. Because activation is proposed to be associated with increased
access to the active site due to displacement of the N-terminus from
the active site, we have used the kinetics of binding of catecholamines
to the active-site iron as a measure of the accessibility of the active
site. The global conformational change upon phenylalanine activation
is accompanied by a change in the fluorescence emission of the enzyme,
mainly due to altered solvent exposure of Trp120;26 this has been used as a separate probe for activation.

Experimental
Procedures

(La Jolla, CA). The pGro7 plasmid was from Takara Bio, Inc. (Otsu,
Shiga, Japan). Pfu polymerase was from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA).
Ampicillin was purchased from Research Products International Corp.
(Mount Prospect, IL). Chloramphenicol and ferric chloride were from
Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). l-Arabinose was from Alfa
Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Magnesium sulfate and Tween 20 were from EMD
Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA). Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) was from Gold Biotechnology, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Leupeptin
was from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Ibaraki-Shi, Osaka, Japan). Lysozyme
was from MP Biomedicals (Santa Ana, CA). Streptomycin sulfate was
from Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B and
Q Sepharose Fast Flow resins were from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences
(Pittsburgh, PA). l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester
hydrochloride, epinephrine bitartrate, and norepinephrine bitartrate
monohydrate were from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA). All
other chemicals were from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) or Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO).

l-Phenylalanine obtained from all
commercial sources examined contains trace amounts of l-tyrosine
and other amino acids that interfered with the quantification of tyrosine
formation by PheH Δ117 R270K. Consequently, the amino acid was
purified further by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
on a C18 μBondapak (19 mm × 300 mm) prep column using 2.5%
methanol as the mobile phase, injecting 0.25 mL aliquots of 5 mg mL–1 phenylalanine per run. The absorbance at 258 nm and
fluorescence emission at 303 nm upon excitation at 275 nm were monitored
simultaneously; the complete UV spectra of individual peaks were also
recorded using an in-line diode array detector. The phenylalanine
peaks eluting at ∼23 min were collected; the eluents from multiple
runs were pooled and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator.

Protein Expression and Purification
A synthetic gene
for wild-type rat PheH optimized for expression in Escherichia
coli was obtained from DNA2.0 (Menlo Park, CA). The gene
was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides
encoding the restriction sites for NcoI (5′-ATACCATGGGCGCTGTTGTACTGGAA-3′)
and BamHI (5′-ATAGGATCCTTAGCTCTTAATCTTCTG-3′).
This amplified gene was inserted into pET23d, and the resulting construct
(pERPH2.0) was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)
cells containing plasmid pGro7. The expression vector for the mutant
PheH R270K was generated by mutagenesis of pERPH2.0 using Pfu polymerase
and the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol. The oligonucleotides used
as primers were 5′-CTGTACCCAATACATTAAGCACGGTAGCAAACCGATG-3′,
and 5′-CATCGGTTTGCTACCGTGCTTAATGTATTGGGTACAG-3′.
The expression vector for PheH Δ117 R270K was generated by mutagenesis
of the plasmid pERPHΔ11727 with Pfu
polymerase using the oligonucleotides 5′-CTGCACACAGTACATTAAGCATGGATCGAAGCCCATG-3′
and 5′-CATGGGCTTCGATCCATGCTTAATGTACTGTGTGCAG-3′
as primers. In all cases, the DNA sequence of the final plasmid used
for expression was determined.

All protein purification steps
were performed at 4 °C except for the chromatography, which was
conducted at room temperature. The expression and purification of
wild-type PheH were modified from those described by Daubner et al.27 LB-Miller medium (100 mL) supplemented with
0.1 mg mL–1 ampicillin, 35 μg mL–1 chloramphenicol, and 0.5 mg mL–1l-arabinose
was inoculated with one colony of BL21(DE3) pGro7 pERPH2.0. After
the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C, Fernbach flasks (2.8
L) containing 2.0 L of LB-Miller medium, 4.0 mM magnesium sulfate,
1.0 mM ferric chloride, 0.1 mg mL–1 ampicillin,
50 μg mL–1 chloramphenicol, and 0.5 mg mL–1l-arabinose were inoculated with 14 mL each
of the small culture. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.4; the temperature was then lowered
to 18 °C. When the A600 reached ∼0.8,
expression of the enzyme was induced with IPTG at a final concentration
of 0.5 mM. After 21 h at 18 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 7500g for 15 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets
were stored at −80 °C. Frozen cell pellets were thawed
and resuspended at 8 mL g–1 in lysis buffer [30
mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 20
mM l-phenylalanine, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetic
acid (DTPA), 1 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin A (pH
7.2)] containing 0.1 mg mL–1 phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF) and 0.3 mg mL–1 lysozyme and lysed
by sonication. Nucleic acids were precipitated with 2% streptomycin
sulfate. After centrifugation, the supernatant was stirred at room
temperature for ∼2 h and then loaded onto a Phenyl Sepharose
CL-4B column (2.6 cm × 46 cm) equilibrated with lysis buffer.
The column was washed with 2.5 column volumes of lysis buffer and
then with 2.5 column volumes of lysis buffer containing 4.8% dimethylformamide
and 0.1% Tween 20. PheH was eluted with 30 mM HEPES, 10–15%
glycerol, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin A, 50 μM
DTPA, and 0.037% Tween 20 (pH 7.2). If the purity of the eluted protein
was &lt;90%, the protein was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast-Flow column
(1.6 cm × 57 cm) and washed with 250 mL of the same buffer. PheH
was eluted with a gradient from 0 to 300 mM KCl in a total volume
of 1.2 L of 30 mM HEPES and 10% glycerol (pH 7.2). The purified PheH
was concentrated to ∼30 mL using an Amicon stirred cell concentrator
(EMD Millipore Corp.) with a 30 kDa NMWL filter. The iron content
of the concentrated PheH was determined using the procedure of Roberts
et al.28 An amount of ferrous ammonium
sulfate sufficient to result in a total iron concentration equivalent
to one iron atom per monomer was added to the purified protein, and
the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The protein was precipitated
by addition of ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation, resuspended in
30 mL of 30 mM HEPES, 10–15% glycerol, 1 μM leupeptin,
and 1 μM pepstatin A (pH 7.2), and then dialyzed against the
same buffer for ∼24 h.

PheH R270K was expressed and purified
as described for wild-type
PheH with minor modifications. Expression cultures were incubated
at 18 °C throughout growth and expression, and cells were harvested
∼26 h after induction. The expression and purification of PheH
Δ117 were performed using the method of Roberts et al.28

PheH Δ117 R270K was expressed with
GroEL/ES in E.
coli BL21(DE3) cells using the pERPHΔ117 R270K and
pGro7 plasmids. One colony that had grown at 37 °C overnight
on an LB agar plate containing 0.1 mg mL–1 ampicillin
and 34 μg mL–1 chloramphenicol was used to
inoculate 100 mL of LB medium containing 0.1 mg mL–1 ampicillin, 0.1 mg mL–1 chloramphenicol, and 0.5
mg mL–1l-arabinose. After growth overnight
at 37 °C, 12 mL aliquots were used to inoculate six Fernbach
flasks each containing 1 L of LB medium with 0.1 mg mL–1 ampicillin, 0.1 mg mL–1 chloramphenicol, and 0.5
mg mL–1l-arabinose. The cultures were
allowed to grow at 37 °C until the A600 reached ∼0.4, at which time the temperature was lowered to
20 °C. The cultures were induced with 60 mg L–1 IPTG when they reached an A600 of ∼0.7.
After 18 h at 20 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 7500g for 15 min. The cell pellets were resuspended
at 8 mL g–1 in 100 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin, 0.1 mg mL–1 PMSF, and 0.1 mg mL–1 lysozyme (pH 7.0). The lysate
was passed through an 18 gauge needle until the lysate became homogeneous
and then stirred for 20 min. The suspension was lysed by sonication.
After centrifugation for 30 min at 15000g, streptomycin
was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1%; after
being stirred for 20 min, the solution was centrifuged for 30 min
at 15000g. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant
to yield 40% saturation; after being stirred for 20 min, the solution
was centrifuged for 30 min at 15000g. The precipitated
protein was resuspended in resuspension buffer [100 mM HEPES, 0.1
mM EDTA, 15% glycerol, 1 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin
(pH 7.0)]. The protein was then dialyzed twice against resuspension
buffer over 12 h. The dialyzed protein was centrifuged for 30 min
at 15000g and then applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast-Flow
column (1.6 cm × 57 cm) equilibrated with resuspension buffer.
The column was washed with buffer until the A280 was lower than 0.1. The protein was then eluted with a
gradient from 0 to 250 mM NaCl in resuspension buffer. Fractions showing
PheH at a purity of &gt;90% by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
were
pooled and dialyzed against 100 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM EDTA, 15% glycerol,
1 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin (pH 7.0), with three
changes over 12 h. The protein was concentrated to 100–150
μM using an Amicon stirred cell concentrator containing a PM30
ultrafiltration membrane (EMD Millipore) and stored at −80
°C. Typically, 6 L yielded ∼50 mg of purified protein.

Assays
Protein concentrations for the PheH R270K mutant
proteins were determined using the extinction coefficients for wild-type
PheH and PheH Δ117.27 The phenylalanine
hydroxylase activity of PheH Δ117 R270K was determined by HPLC
on a Gemini-NX C18 150 mm × 2.0 mm column with a mobile phase
of 0.1% acetic acid. The assays contained 3 μM enzyme, 0–100
mM purified l-phenylalanine, 250 μM 6-methyltetrahydropterin,
80 mM HEPES, 60 μg mL–1 catalase, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
and 5 μM ferrous ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0). These conditions
were the same as those used previously for the wild-type enzyme,27 although much lower concentrations of phenylalanine
and enzyme were required in that case. Assays were initiated with
enzyme and quenched at 0, 5, and 10 min with a 50% volume of 2 M HCl;
in all cases, the reaction of the mutant enzyme was linear over this
time period. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10000g and diluted 10-fold with 0.1% acetic acid before being
injected onto the HPLC column. Tyrosine was detected by fluorescence
with the excitation wavelength set at 275 nm and the emission wavelength
set at 303 nm. A standard curve of 0–100 μM l-tyrosine was used to quantify the amount of tyrosine produced.

To determine the relative stoichiometry of tetrahydropterin oxidation
and tyrosine formation, assays contained 10 or 20 μM enzyme,
100 μM 6-methyltetrahydropterin, 100 mM purified l-phenylalanine,
and 80 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). Reactions were initiated by the addition
of 6-methyltetrahydropterin and quenched after 5 min with a 50% volume
of 2 M HCl. The amount of tyrosine produced was then determined by
HPLC as described above.

The binding of catecholamines to PheH
was monitored using an Applied
Photophysics (Leatherhead, Surrey, U.K.) SX20 stopped-flow spectrophotometer.
PheH (46 μM in iron) in 0.2 M HEPES (pH 7.0), with or without
2.0 mM l-phenylalanine, was mixed with varying concentrations
of each catecholamine and the reaction followed at 700 nm. The binding
of phenylalanine was monitored by a stopped-flow method with fluorescence
detection, with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and a cutoff filter
at 345 nm; the path length of the cell was 10 mm, and the entrance
and exit slit widths were set to 0.35 mm. Enzyme (5 μM) in 0.2
M HEPES (pH 7.5) in one syringe at 25 °C was mixed with 0.025–2
mM l-phenylalanine from the second. All concentrations are
after mixing.

Data Analysis
Individual stopped-flow
traces were analyzed
as single and multiple exponentials using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software,
Reading, PA). Stopped-flow traces for the binding of multiple concentrations
of each catecholamine to PheH were fit globally using KinTek Explorer.29 In each fit, all rate constants, extinction
coefficients, and y-axis offsets were allowed to
vary. Confidence intervals for the best fit values for each rate constant
were determined using the FitSpace module for KinTek Explorer.30 The confidence intervals reported here are the
values for each parameter that yield a sum square error that is 30%
larger than that for the best fit when all other parameters are optimized.

Results
Characterization of PheH R270K
In the active site of
PheH, the carboxylate of the bound amino acid substrate forms ionic
interactions with Arg270 and hydrogen bonds with the amide of Thr278
and the hydroxyl of Ser349 (Figure 2). Mutagenesis
to lysine of the homologous residue in TyrH, Arg316, increases the Km value for tyrosine to &gt;10 mM and decreases
the kcat/Ktyr value by 3700-fold.31 Consequently, Arg270
in PheH was mutated to lysine to decrease the level of binding of
the amino acid substrate in the active site of that enzyme. The mutation
was incorporated into both the intact protein and PheH Δ117,
a mutant PheH that lacks the regulatory domain. The activity of the
enzyme was measured with the latter, because it is fully active in
the absence of activation by phenylalanine,27 simplifying the kinetics. The mutant enzyme had no detectable activity
at phenylalanine concentrations of &lt;1 mM. When the activity was
determined at phenylalanine concentrations from 5 to 100 mM, there
was detectable activity that increased in a linear fashion with the
phenylalanine concentration. This kinetic behavior sets a lower limit
on the Km value for phenylalanine of PheH
R270K of 0.5 M and precludes measurement of a kcat value. A kcat/Kphe of 1.7 ± 0.2 M–1 min–1 could be determined from these data. This value is down 106-fold from the value for the wild-type enzyme.27

Figure 2 Amino acid substrate interactions in the active site of phenylalanine
hydroxylase. The figure is based on the structure of the catalytic
domain of human phenylalanine hydroxylase with norleucine (nLeu) and
tetrahydrobiopterin (Protein Data Bank entry 1MMT).

Because mutagenesis of monooxygenases such as PheH
frequently results
in an uncoupling of hydroxylation and consumption of reducing equivalents,
the relative stoichiometry of tetrahydropterin oxidation and tyrosine
formation was determined for PheH R270K by determining the amount
of tyrosine produced from a limiting amount of tetrahydropterin. Only
0.92 ± 0.09% of the pterin was oxidized to produce tyrosine;
the rest was likely oxidized directly to dihydropterin.32

Catecholamine Binding
The effect
of activation by phenylalanine
on the accessibility of the active site in PheH was analyzed by measuring
the rate constants for binding of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine,
and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester (DOPAME) to the active-site
iron for different forms of the enzyme. The complexes formed upon
binding of the catechol oxygens to the iron are readily detected from
the absorbance of a catecholate-to-metal charge transfer band near
700 nm.33 Representative traces observed
upon mixing the enzyme with dopamine are shown in Figure 3. For each catecholamine considered here, the traces
for the wild-type enzyme could be fit (R2 &gt; 0.99) as single-exponential increases,a with
the rate constant for formation of the complex increasing linearly
with the catecholamine concentration. To obtain the individual rate
constants, the data for all concentrations of each catecholamine were
fit globally with Scheme 1, which describes
a simple reversible binding. The values for the second-order rate
constant for association (k1) range from
0.7 to 4 mM–1 s–1 for the different
catecholamines (Table S1 of the Supporting Information and Figure 4). The k1 values for epinephrine and norepinephrine are 3–6-fold
lower than those for DOPAME and dopamine, indicating that the β-hydroxyl
group results in slower binding of the catecholamine. The values for
the rate constants for dissociation (k–1) are small and are not significantly different from 0 s–1 in general; this is consistent with Kd values of &lt;5 μM, in line with previous studies.34,35

iron of PheH. Reactions were performed by mixing 23 μM PheH

Figure 4 Rate constants for binding of catecholamines
to PheH variants.

Mutant variants of PheH
that lack the N-terminal regulatory domain
do not require activation by phenylalanine.27 In addition, the structures of the isolated catalytic domain of
PheH with catecholamines bound show the catechol oxygens as ligands
to the metal and the amine moiety exposed to solvent, so that catechols
have unhindered access to the iron.36 Consequently,
the binding of catecholamines to a mutant PheH lacking the regulatory
domain (PheH Δ117) was analyzed to determine the limiting rate
constants for binding in the absence of any effect of the regulatory
domain on access of ligands to the active site. The traces again could
be described as single-exponential increases in absorbance, and the
concentration dependencies were fit globally using the mechanism in
Scheme 1 (Figure 3B).
For all four catecholamines, the values for k1 with PheH Δ117 were larger than those for the wild-type
enzyme (Table S1 of the Supporting Information and Figure 4); the magnitude of the increase
varied for each catecholamine. The value for dopamine showed the smallest
change, increasing by 68%. The value for epinephrine experienced the
largest change, increasing to nearly 4 times that with wild-type PheH.
These increases are consistent with the absence of the regulatory
domain resulting in increased accessibility of the active-site iron.
The k1 values for epinephrine and norepinephrine
with PheH Δ117 were again significantly lower than those for
DOPAME and dopamine, indicating that the effect seen with the wild-type
enzyme is due to differences in binding to the catalytic domain and
not the presence of the regulatory domain.

The proposal that
the regulatory domain no longer blocks access
to the active site in the phenylalanine-activated enzyme predicts
that this form of the enzyme should bind catecholamines like PheH
Δ117. However, the absorbance traces resulting from mixing phenylalanine-activated
wild-type PheH with DOPAME or dopamine were markedly slower and more
complex than in the absence of phenylalanine, fitting poorly to single
exponentials with at least two phases visible at the higher catecholamine
concentrations (Figure 3C and Figure S1 of
the Supporting Information).

One
possible explanation for the complex binding kinetics of the
activated wild-type enzyme is that binding of phenylalanine in the
active site is affecting catecholamine binding. Because phenylalanine
binds in the active site of PheH R270K much more weakly than in the
case of the wild-type enzyme, any effect of phenylalanine on binding
of catecholamine to this mutant protein should reflect only changes
due to binding of the amino acid at a site other than the active site.
As is the case with the wild-type enzyme in the absence of phenylalanine,
the kinetics of binding of all four catecholamines to the mutant protein
were monophasic (Figure 3D), allowing the data
to be analyzed using the mechanism of Scheme 1. The resulting kinetic constants are given in Figure 4 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information. All of the k1 values are within 2-fold
of the values for the wild-type enzyme and significantly lower than
the values for PheH Δ117.

The catecholamine binding kinetics
for PheH R270K in the presence
of phenylalanine were much simpler than those of the wild-type enzyme
in the presence of the amino acid, resembling instead those of PheH
Δ117 and the unactivated wild-type enzyme (Figure 3E). For all four catecholamines, the values for k1 with phenylalanine-treated PheH R270K were larger than
the respective values in the absence of phenylalanine, and the increase
in the rate constant for the mutant protein was comparable to that
seen upon removing the regulatory domain from the wild-type enzyme
(Figure 4). Indeed, for all but DOPAME, the
values were within error of the k1 values
for PheH Δ117. Thus, binding of phenylalanine to PheH R270K
makes the active site as accessible as complete removal of the regulatory
domain. In light of the effect of this mutation on phenylalanine binding
in the active site, this increased accessibility requires that there
be a separate site for phenylalanine.

Stopped-Flow Fluorescence
Spectroscopy of Phenylalanine Binding
Activation of PheH
by phenylalanine is accompanied by a change
in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the protein, which shifts
to longer wavelengths.37,38 This allows the conformational
change to be monitored by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy.
As shown in Figure 5A, mixing of either wild-type
PheH or PheH R270K with 250 μM phenylalanine results in a relatively
slow increase in the fluorescence emission at wavelengths greater
than 345 nm. At this concentration of phenylalanine, the magnitudes
of the fluorescence change are comparable for the two enzymes, although
the change occurs ∼5-fold faster for the wild-type enzyme.
The observation of this fluorescence change in a mutant protein unable
to bind phenylalanine in the active site establishes that a protein
conformational change consistent with activation involves binding
at a site other than the active site. Analysis of the magnitude of
the fluorescence change as a function of the concentration of phenylalanine
showed that the behavior of the wild-type enzyme is more complex than
that of the mutant protein, with the apparent binding of a second
phenylalanine resulting in a decrease in the total fluorescence change
(Figure 5B).

light was passed through a 345 nm cutoff filter. The lines in panel
B are from fits to ΔF = ΔFtot[phenylalanine]/(K1 + [phenylalanine]
+ [phenylalanine]2/K2) for
the wild-type enzyme and to ΔF = ΔFtot[phenylalanine]/(Kd + [phenylalanine]) for the mutant enzyme. Conditions: 0.2 M HEPES,
pH 7.5, 25 °C.

Discussion
The
results of the experiments described here strongly support
a model in which activation of PheH by phenylalanine involves binding
at a site other than the active site. In light of the evidence that
phenylalanine will bind the isolated regulatory domain,22,23 the most likely location for this allosteric site is in the regulatory
domain.

Mutagenesis of Arg270 of PheH decreases the level of
binding of
the amino acid substrate in the active site to negligible levels at
accessible phenylalanine concentrations. This is consistent with the
ionic interaction between the carboxylate of the substrate and the
side chain of Arg270 being critical for binding. The decrease in affinity
calculated from the decrease in the kcat/Kphe value is 106-fold, while
the increase in the Km value sets a lower
limit of 3500-fold.27 The kcat/Kphe value measured from
tyrosine formation reflects only the turnovers that result in the
formation of tyrosine, so that it will be decreased by unproductive
oxidation of the tetrahydropterin substrate. Such uncoupling has been
described previously for a number of mutants of PheH and the other
aromatic amino acid hydroxylases.39−42 Unproductive enzyme-catalyzed
tetrahydropterin oxidation still requires binding of both the pterin
and the amino acid substrate before a reaction with oxygen occurs.
It is the unproductive breakdown of an oxygen-containing intermediate
prior to hydroxylation of the amino acid that results in the unproductive
turnover.39,43,44 Correction
of the kcat/Kphe value for PheH R270K for its 99% unproductive turnover yields a
decrease of 12000-fold from that of the wild-type enzyme. This is
comparable to the 3700-fold decrease in the kcat/Km value for tyrosine when
the identical mutation is incorporated into tyrosine hydroxylase.

No structure of PheH that has been activated by phenylalanine is
yet available, so that the details of the structural changes accompanying
activation are not known. The proposal that activation is a consequence
of the movement of the N-terminus of the regulatory domain away from
the active site15 predicts that molecules
that bind the active site should do so more readily with the activated
enzyme. We selected binding of catecholamine to the active-site iron
to test this prediction. The primary interaction of catecholamines
with PheH is with the active-site iron36 rather than with active-site residues, so that binding is less likely
to be perturbed by any change within the active site than binding
of a pterin or amino acid analogue would be. In addition, the ligand-to-metal
charge transfer absorbance at ∼700 nm allows the binding of
a catechol to the iron to be readily monitored. The increase in the
association rate constants for all four of the catecholamines analyzed
here when the regulatory domain is absent supports a model in which
activation involves increased active-site accessibility due to displacement
of the N-terminal inhibitory peptide. Catecholamines do bind to the
unactivated enzyme with significant rate constants, establishing that
the iron is not completely inaccessible to solvent in the unactivated
enzyme; this result is consistent with the known structure of PheH
containing the regulatory domain (Figure 1).
Critically, the magnitudes of the increases in the rate constants
for formation of the catecholamine complexes by PheH R270K when phenylalanine
is added agree well with the increases in these rate constants for
the wild-type enzyme when the regulatory domain is removed. Thus,
binding of phenylalanine at a site outside of the active site has
the same effect on the accessibility of the active-site iron to catecholamines
that complete removal of the regulatory domain does. This result provides
substantive support for the proposed model of activation. It also
establishes that a conformational change that makes the active site
more accessible involves phenylalanine binding at a site separate
from the active site.

A number of lines of evidence have established
that the conformational
change accompanying activation of PheH involves changes more extensive
than simple displacement of an inhibitory peptide from the active
site. The activated enzyme has a higher affinity for hydrophobic surfaces,
a feature used in the most common purification protocol for PheH,45 so that activation changes the exposure of hydrophobic
residues on the protein surface. There is a significant change in
the protein fluorescence due mainly to changes in the fluorescence
emission maximum of Trp120.26,37 This residue is distant
from the active site but close to the interface between the catalytic
and regulatory domains, so that this interface is altered in the activated
protein. A more detailed analysis of the structural change accompanying
activation from mass spectrometric analysis of the effects of phenylalanine
on the exchange of deuterium from solvent into peptide amides showed
that the entire interface between the two domains incorporates deuterium
more rapidly in the activated enzyme, not just the 30 N-terminal residues.46 The proposal of Jaffe et al.17 provides a model for this change in the interactions between
the two domains.

The change in tryptophan fluorescence emission
when PheH is activated
by phenylalanine was selected as a direct measure of this larger conformational
change upon activation. That this fluorescence change is seen even
with the R270K enzyme provides further evidence that phenylalanine
activation is due to binding outside of the active site. Thus, binding
of the amino acid to a site outside of the active site is associated
with both the local change that exposes the active site and the more
global change in the protein conformation.

There are differences
between wild-type PheH and the R270K protein
in the effects of phenylalanine on both the binding of catecholamines
and the fluorescence change. In both cases, the wild type exhibits
more complex behavior; this is likely due to binding of the amino
acid in the enzyme active site. We have not attempted to develop a
complete kinetic model for binding of catecholamine to the activated
wild-type enzyme. A minimal model in which there is competition between
binding of the catecholamine to the iron and binding of phenylalanine
in the active site gives an improved fit to the data but still does
not fully replicate the kinetics (results not shown). The decrease
in the magnitude of the fluorescence change at higher concentrations
of the amino acid suggests that binding at the active site may be
associated with an additional change in the environment of Trp120.
Fully activated PheH still exhibits a Hill coefficient of ∼2
for phenylalanine,47 consistent with interactions
between the active sites of different subunits. Mutagenesis of Trp120
to phenylalanine significantly decreases the cooperativity of the
activated enzyme,26 suggesting that the
conformation of the protein near this residue is linked to the homotropic
activation involving active-site binding. Cys237 lies at the interface
of the catalytic, regulatory, and oligomerization domains of the enzyme
and is close to Arg68 in the regulatory domain. The R68V and C237D
mutants do not require activation by phenylalanine but still have
Hill coefficients that are not significantly different from the value
for the wild-type enzyme,48 providing further
evidence of the linkage of subunit–subunit interactions to
binding of the amino acid substrate in the active site.

The
regulation of PheH is clearly complex. As proposed by Shiman,8 phenylalanine binding is required for formation
of the active enzyme. This work establishes that the initial activation
by phenylalanine involves binding at a site other than the active
site. The evidence that the isolated regulatory domain will bind phenylalanine
and the loss of allosteric properties when the regulatory domain is
removed establish the regulatory domain as the likely site for the
activating allosteric site.

a There is
a much slower increase in
absorbance at longer times visible in several of the traces; this
was ascribed to the slow oxidation of catecholamines and was not included
in the kinetic analyses. Possibly as a result of this slower increase,
fitting the data to two exponentials rather than one resulted in a
statistical improvement in the fitting in several cases (from R2 &gt; 0.99 to R2 &gt;
0.999). However, the trends seen in Figure 4 were unaffected.
