A hallmark
of penicillin-binding protein 2 (PBP2) from penicillin-resistant
strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is insertion of
an aspartate after position 345. The insertion resides on a loop near
the active site and is immediately adjacent to an existing aspartate
(Asp346) that forms a functionally important hydrogen bond with Ser363
of the SxN conserved motif. Insertion of other amino acids, including
Glu and Asn, can also lower the rate of acylation by penicillin, but
these insertions abolish transpeptidase function. Although the kinetic
consequences of the Asp insertion are well-established, how it impacts
the structure of PBP2 is unknown. Here, we report the 2.2 Å resolution
crystal structure of a truncated construct of PBP2 containing all
five mutations present in PBP2 from the penicillin-resistant strain
6140, including the Asp insertion. Commensurate with the strict specificity
for the Asp insertion over similar amino acids, the insertion does
not cause disordering of the structure, but rather induces localized
flexibility in the β2c−β2d loop. The crystal structure
resolves the ambiguity of whether the insertion is Asp345a or Asp346a
(due to the adjacent Asp) because the hydrogen bond between Asp346
and Ser362 is preserved and the insertion is therefore Asp346a. The
side chain of Asp346a projects directly toward the β-lactam-binding
site near Asn364 of the SxN motif. The Asp insertion may lower the
rate of acylation by sterically impeding binding of the antibiotic
or by hindering breakage of the β-lactam ring during acylation
because of the negative charge of its side chain.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the
causative agent of
the sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea. Penicillin was the primary
treatment for gonorrhea for more than 40 years, but in 1987 was withdrawn
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a recommended
treatment because of the increasing prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae strains exhibiting resistance. Extended-spectrum cephalosporins
and fluoroquinolones then became the mainstay for treatment, but again,
because of increasing resistance, fluoroquinolones were withdrawn
in 2007; this was followed by cefixime in 2012.1 The current recommendation from the CDC for treatment of
gonorrhea is dual therapy with ceftriaxone and either azithromycin
or doxycycline. However, strains of N. gonorrhoeae have been identified with high-level resistance to azithromycin,2 and together with the recent isolation of strains
with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone,3−5 this portends
that strains exhibiting resistance to essentially all antibiotics
will soon emerge.

The lethal targets for penicillin and other
β-lactams are
the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which function as transpeptidases
(TPases), carboxypeptidases, or endopeptidases during the latter stages
of cell-wall synthesis.6−8 As structural analogues of the acyl-d-Ala-d-Ala peptide substrate for PBPs, β-lactams bind to the
active site of PBPs and acylate a serine nucleophile, forming a long-lived
covalent intermediate that renders the active site unavailable to
bind peptide substrate. There are four PBPs in the N. gonorrhoeae genome. PBP1 and PBP2 are high-molecular mass (HMM) PBPs that are
essential for growth; PBP1 is a bifunctional glycosyl transferase
and TPase important for peptidoglycan biosynthesis during cell growth,
whereas PBP2 is a monofunctional TPase involved in cell division.9 In contrast, PBP3 and PBP4 are nonessential low-molecular
mass PBPs that catalyze carboxypeptidase and endopeptidase activity in vitro.10,11 While PBP4 does not appear to
be expressed, when assessed by binding of a fluorescent β-lactam,
a strain with a double deletion of PBP3 and PBP4 exhibits a much stronger
morphological phenotype and grows slower than either of the strains
with individual deletions.10

In the
stepwise transformation of N. gonorrhoeae from a
penicillin-susceptible strain to a strain exhibiting high-level
resistance, acquisition of a mutated allele of PBP2 is the first and
prerequisite step.12,13 These variants of PBP2 contain
mutations that lower the second-order rate of acylation by penicillin
without any apparent impairment of the essential TPase function of
the PBP. Examination of the sequence of penA, the
gene encoding PBP2, from a number of penicillin-resistant strains
of N. gonorrhoeae reveals that there are generally
five to eight amino acid changes in PBP2 compared to wild-type penA from the penicillin-susceptible strains, FA19 and LM306.14−17 These changes include insertion of an aspartate codon after position
345 (termed Asp345a) and a variable number of substitutions toward
the C-terminal end of the protein. The Asp insertion is a consistent
feature of penA sequences obtained from penicillin-resistant
strains15 and is the only amino acid selected
for in random insertional mutagenesis experiments at position 345a.16 The crystal structure of PBP2 is known,17 and the insertion is positioned on the β2a−β2d
hairpin loop that is in the proximity of the active site. This loop
is connected to the conserved SxN active-site motif via a hydrogen
bond between Asp346 and Ser363 (the x of the SxN motif).17 The curiosity of this insertion is that because
it is adjacent to an existing aspartate (Asp346), the actual location
of the insertion is ambiguous; it could reside before or after Asp346,
i.e., Asp345a or Asp346a.18 Interestingly,
there is a strict requirement for an Asp-Asp pair to achieve penicillin
resistance. Insertion of nearly all other amino acids at either position,
including the similarly charged glutamate or similarly shaped asparagine,
lowers the rate of acylation by penicillin but cannot transform N. gonorrhoeae to higher resistance, suggesting that these
insertions disrupt the essential TPase function of PBP2.16,18 These data also indicate that the Asp insertion, whether at position
345a or 346a, contributes to penicillin resistance in a very specific
way.

PBP2 derived from the penicillin-resistant gonococcal strain
FA614019 contains the Asp insertion along
with four C-terminal
substitutions, which together lower the rate of acylation of PBP2
by 15-fold.17 In a previous study, we assessed
the relative contributions of the four C-terminal substitutions versus
the Asp insertion and found that they each lowered the rate of acylation
of PBP2 with penicillin G by 6-fold. Surprisingly, a crystal structure
of PBP2 containing the four C-terminal substitutions (PBP2-6140CT)
showed very little difference when compared with that of wild-type
PBP2 from FA19, suggesting a subtle mechanism of penicillin resistance.17 To date, however, full-length constructs of
PBP2 containing the Asp insertion have failed to crystallize, thus
restricting our understanding of how this insertion contributes to
penicillin resistance.

Here we report the crystal structure
of the TPase/β-lactam-binding
domain of PBP2 harboring the Asp insertion and the four C-terminal
mutations, determined at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure shows
that functionally the Asp insertion comes after Asp346, as the first
Asp of the pair retains its interaction with Ser363, while the second
Asp points directly toward the β-lactam-binding site where it
interferes with binding of the antibiotic or the chemistry of acylation.

Experimental
Procedures
Cloning, Expression, and Purification of a Truncated PBP2 Construct
Truncated constructs comprising only the TPase/β-lactam-binding
domain of PBP2 (residues 237–581) were generated by cloning
nucleotides 709–1746 of the wild-type penA gene from FA19 or nucleotides 709–1749 of the penA gene from the N. gonorrhoeae penicillin-resistant
strain 6140 into pMALC2KV, a derivative of pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs,
Beverly, MA). This construct fuses PBP2 to maltose-binding protein
(MBP) containing a hexahistidine tag at its N-terminus and an intervening
tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease site between the two proteins. A
segment of the protein that protrudes from the TPase domain, comprising
residues 283–297, was also removed, and fusion of Pro282 and
Arg298 was made with an intervening glycine (with the goal of introducing
a β-turn). The final purified constructs encoded proteins of
331 (termed PBP2-t3-wt) and 332 amino acids (termed PBP2-t3-6140).

The expression constructs were transformed into Escherichia
coli GW6011 cells; 2 L of cell culture was grown at 37 °C,
and protein expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mM isopropyl
β-d-thiogalactoside, followed by overnight incubation
at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, lysed in 20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol (TNG), and the
MBP–PBP2 fusion protein was purified on a 5 mL HisTrap FF column
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). The fusion protein was pooled, concentrated
to 2–3 mL by ultrafiltration, mixed with His6-tagged
TEV protease at a molar ratio of 10:1, and dialyzed overnight at 4
°C against TNG to allow cleavage of the fusion protein and to
remove imidazole. The resulting digest was then passed over a 5 mL
HisTrap HP column equilibrated with TNG. Purified PBP2-t3-wt and PBP2-t3-6140
did not elute in the flow-through but instead were eluted by a TNG/15
to 250 mM imidazole linear gradient. Uncleaved fusion protein, His6-TEV, and His6-maltose-binding protein remained
bound to the column and were eluted with a TNG/250 mM imidazole wash
step. The purified proteins were pooled, dialyzed into 20 mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol, and concentrated by ultrafiltration.

Acylation Rates of PBP2-t3 Constructs
The reaction
of β-lactam antibiotics with PBPs is described by eq 1: 1  where E·S is the noncovalent
enzyme–antibiotic complex, E–S′ is the acyl–enzyme
complex, and P is the hydrolyzed antibiotic.20 The second-order rate constant (k2/Ks) is a direct measure of the reactivity of
an antibiotic for a PBP. k2/Ks constants for the reaction of PBP2 variants with the
fluorescent penicillin Bocillin-FL (Life Technologies Inc., Grand
Island, NY) were determined by measuring time-dependent decreases
in the intrinsic fluorescence of PBP2. Under subsaturating conditions,
when [S] &lt; Km, the kinetics are described
by eq 2: 2  where [S] is the β-lactam concentration, ka is the pseudo-first-order rate constant of
formation of the E–S complex at a given [S] value, v is the initial rate of formation of the E–S complex,
and Et is the total enzyme concentration. k2/Ks is the slope
of a plot of ka versus [S].20 The deacylation rate (k3) is very slow compared to the acylation rate and can be ignored
for these experiments.

Acylation of PBP2 by Bocillin-FL quenches
the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein, thus providing a real-time
measurement of formation of the acyl–enzyme complex. The fluorescence
quenching curves of PBP2 variants were recorded at 25 °C on a
Quanta Master fluorimeter (QM4, Photon Technology International, Inc.,
Birmingham, NJ) with fluorescence excitation at 295 nm and emission
at 331 nm (slit widths of 2 and 4 nm, respectively). PBP2 was diluted
into 2 mL of binding buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8)] to a final
concentration of 1 μM and then mixed with Bocillin-FL. The time-dependent
decrease in intrinsic fluorescence was recorded immediately after
the addition of Bocillin-FL in the subsaturating concentration range
of 5–10 μM. At least two independent experiments were
performed with a new protein sample each time. Data were corrected
for the buffer and ligand background signals. The quench curves of
intrinsic fluorescence were then used to calculate pseudo-first-order
rate constants of acylation (ka) at each
Bocillin-FL concentration. Using eq 2, k2/Ks values were
derived from plots of ka versus [S], where
the slope of the line defines the second-order acylation rate constant.
The reported value for k2/Ks is the average of at least two such plots. All curve-fitting
analyses and calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism version
4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).

Sodium
Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE)-Based Binding Assay
k2/Ks constants for the reaction
of truncated constructs of wild-type PBP2 and PBP2-6140 with meropenem
were determined by a SDS–PAGE-based competition assay using
Bocillin-FL. Each PBP2 variant (1 μM) was incubated with 10
μM Bocillin-FL in the presence of increasing concentrations
(0.05–100 μM) of meropenem to a final volume of 50 μL
at 25 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL
of 5× SDS–PAGE sample buffer, and the mixture was boiled
at 98 °C for 2 min. Acylated PBP2 was then separated from free
β-lactam using 10% Mini-Protean TGX SDS–PAGE gels (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc.). Gels were scanned using a Kodak EDAS 290 UV imaging
system (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak, New Haven, CT),
followed by staining with Coomassie R-250 to confirm equivalent loading.
Bocillin-FL-bound PBP2 was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ
version 1.48 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Data points
were normalized to the maximum of the fluorescence intensity (defining
the complete saturation of PBP2 by Bocillin-FL). Data from three independent
experiments (each in duplicate) were used to determine IC50 values of meropenem for each PBP2 variant, from which second-order
acylation rate constants were derived using eq 3:20 3  where (k2/Ks)U is the rate constant of an unlabeled
compound, (k2/Ks)L is the rate constant of Bocillin-FL, and [SL] is the concentration of Bocillin-FL used in the competition experiment.

All curve-fitting analyses and calculations were performed using
GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Proteolytic Susceptibility of PBP2-6140 Mutants
The
susceptibility of purified full-length (i.e., residues 44–581)
PBP2 and PBP2-6140 mutants to proteolysis was determined by conducting
a time course of trypsin digestion, separating the resulting fragments
on SDS–10% polyacrylamide gels, and staining with Coomassie
R-250, as described previously.18

Crystallization
and Data Collection
Crystallization
trials of PBP2-t3-6140 were performed using a Gryphon liquid-handling
robot (Art-Robbins, Sunnyvale, CA) in 96-well sitting-drop plates
(INTELLI-PLATE, Art-Robbins). The protein was screened at a concentration
of 9.2 mg/mL using the vapor-diffusion method against a number of
commercially available sparse matrix screens, including JCSG+ Suite
and JCSG Cores I–IV Suite (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). For each
well, 200 nL of protein was mixed with 200 nL of well solution. Conditions
under which crystals were obtained were later optimized in 24-well
Limbro plates (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) using 2 μL
hanging drop volumes.

Structure Determination
Crystals
were cryoprotected
in mother liquor, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction
data were collected at SER-CAT beamline ID22 at the Advanced Photon
Source at the Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL) in 1°
oscillations with an exposure time of 3 s per frame and a crystal–detector
distance of 200 mm. Data were processed with HKL2000.21 The structure was determined by molecular replacement using
the CCP4 program PHASER22 with the TPase
domain of wild-type PBP2 as the search model [molecule A of Protein
Data Bank (PDB) entry 3EQU].17 The structure was determined
with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and then refined by alternating
rounds of REFMAC refinement23 and manual
building using O.24 Residues 542–545
of molecule A and residues 504–511 and 543–545 of molecule
B could be not be modeled because of weak or absent electron density.
Alternative conformations were modeled for the side chain of Ser551
in molecule A. A non-native alanine at the N-terminus resulting from
the construct was modeled as Ala236 in both molecules of the asymmetric
unit.

The stereochemistry of the final model was assessed by
PROCHECK.25 The φ and ψ angles
for Leu447 in both molecules of the asymmetric unit occupy the disallowed
region of the Ramachandran plot. Both of these residues, however,
exhibit excellent electron density. These residues are present on
the α9−α10 loop; its conformation is influenced
by the absence of the N-terminal domain of PBP2 in the truncated construct
(see Results and Discussion). Asp346a and
Thr347 of molecule B both occupy the generously allowed region of
the Ramachandran plot, but these findings can be explained by the
weak electron density at the Asp insertion site.

Results and Discussion
A Truncated
Construct of PBP2 Exhibits Wild-Type Rates of Acylation
by β-Lactams
Despite extensive screening, full-length
constructs of PBP2 containing the Asp345a insertion have failed to
crystallize to date; therefore, we designed, expressed, and purified
a truncated construct of PBP2 to provide a new vehicle for crystallization
(PBP2-t3-wt). This construct contains only the TPase/β-lactam-binding
domain of the enzyme (amino acids 237–581) minus a segment
of 15 residues between Pro282 and Arg298. This segment was excluded
because, in the absence of the N-terminal domain, these residues would
form a distinct protrusion from the TPase domain that might impede
crystallization (see below). A similar construct was also made using penA from the penicillin-resistant strain 6140 (PBP2-t3-6140).

Before we proceeded with crystallization trials, it was important
to determine whether the absence of the N-terminal domain impacted
the acylation rate of the truncated PBP2 constructs. The second-order
rates of acylation (k2/Ks) of (full-length) wild-type PBP2 and PBP2-t3-wt for
the fluorescent penicillin, Bocillin-FL, were nearly identical, and
the corresponding k2/Ks acylation rates for PBP2-6140 (full-length PBP2 containing
five mutations) and PBP2-t3-6140 are also very similar (Table 1 and Figure 1). For both
full-length and truncated constructs, the fold difference between
the wild type (14-fold) and 6140 (9-fold) was also similar. These
data indicate that removal of the N-terminal domain does not significantly
impact the β-lactam-binding activity of the TPase domain and
that mutations associated with penicillin resistance have the same
impact on the acylation kinetics.

acylation of Bocillin-FL against full-length
and truncated constructs of wild-type PBP2 and PBP2 from the penicillin-resistant
strain 6140. For each experiment, the pseudo-first-order rates of
acylation (ka) were plotted vs the concentration
of Bocillin-FL. Shown is the average plot of at least two or more
independent experiments, where the slope of the line yields the second-order k2/Ks value.

Because the only acylated structure
of PBP2 determined to date
is in complex with meropenem (see below), we also measured k2/Ks acylation constants
of PBP2-t3-wt and PBP2-t3-6140 for meropenem (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 1 of the Supporting Information). These were 313400 ± 63500 M–1 s–1 for PBP2-t3-wt and 68100 ±
14500 M–1 s–1 for PBP2-t3-6140,
corresponding to a nearly 5-fold decrease in acylation rate. This
shows that mutations contributing to penicillin resistance can also
discriminate against a carbapenem.

Structure Determination
Crystals of PBP2-t3-6140 were
obtained at 18 °C over wells containing 21% PEG 6000 buffered
with 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.8). The space group of the crystals is P21, and there are two molecules in the asymmetric
unit. The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement
using the TPase domain of wild-type PBP2 as a search model17 and refined to 2.2 Å resolution with a
crystallographic R factor of 21.3% with excellent
stereochemistry (Table 2).

Comparison between Molecules A and B of the Asymmetric Unit
Overall, the two molecules in the asymmetric unit adopt similar
structures and superimpose with a rmsd of 0.86 Å for all common
main chain atoms (Figure 2). There are, however,
some structural differences of note. In the crystal structures of
both wild-type PBP2 and PBP2-6140CT (which contains the four C-terminal
substitutions but lacks the Asp345a insertion), 10–11 residues
of the β3−β4 loop could not be modeled because
of flexibility.17 In molecule A of the
crystal structure of PBP2-t3-6140, all residues of the loop are visible
in the electron density, thus providing the first structural view
of these residues (Figure 3). In contrast,
residues 504–511 in molecule B exhibit weak or absent electron
density and could not be modeled. This region is significant because
two mutations associated with penicillin resistance (P504L and A510V)
reside in this loop.17 The differences
in this region between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit suggest
the degree of flexibility in the β3−β4 loop is
influenced directly by crystal packing interactions. Hence, the structural
impact on this loop of mutations associated with antibiotic resistance
must be assessed with caution. Other regions that differ in the two
molecules of the asymmetric unit are the β2a−β2d
hairpin, the loop between α9 and α10, the N-terminal end
of α8, and the β5−α11 loop (Figure 2). As features on the surface of the molecule, all
these differences could result from the different crystal packing
environment around each molecule.

strains of N. gonorrhoeae are labeled in red. Arrows

A and (B) molecule B.

Comparison with the Structure of Wild-Type PBP2
As
shown in Figure 2 of the Supporting Information, the respective TPase domains of wild-type PBP2 (within the full-length
structure) and PBP2-t3-6140 do not differ significantly in structure.
The rmsds of 0.75 Å (molecule A to molecule A) and 0.77 Å
(molecule B to molecule B) between all common main chain atoms in
the TPase domains indicate a very close superimposition for both molecules
of the asymmetric unit. Hence, the absence of the N-terminal domain
in PBP2-t3-6140 does not have any significant impact on the structure
of the TPase domain of PBP2 and is congruent with the nearly identical
rates of acylation observed for the t3 constructs compared to the
full-length proteins (see above). This result also reinforces the
idea that the β domains of PBPs (whether N-terminal or C-terminal)
serve mainly as pedestals either to project the catalytic domain toward
its peptidoglycan substrates or to target the protein to appropriate
sites of cell-wall synthesis, rather than having any direct effect
on enzyme function.17,26

Aside from the insertion
site and the aforementioned β3−β4 loop, the other
differences are minimal (Figure 4). The shift
in residues 388–403, which is a β-hairpin loop that connects
α9 with α10, can be explained by the absence of the N-terminal
domain because, in the structure of full-length PBP2, this loop packs
directly against the N-terminal domain and those contacts are lost
in PBP2-t3-6140. In fact, this is the only difference between the
two structures that can be attributed directly to the absence of the
N-terminal domain. As expected, there is also a difference at the
Pro282-Arg298 “join” in PBP2-t3-6140. The removal of
residues 283–297 (with addition of a Gly linker), however,
was a very successful strategy because there is only a marginal difference
in the structure immediately preceding and following the join. The
join itself exhibits excellent density, even though the Gly linker
is non-native (Figure 3 of the Supporting Information).

in cartoon form, with PBP2-t3-6140 colored blue and wild-type PBP2
colored yellow. Regions exhibiting structural differences are indicated.
The β-hairpin region of PBP2-t3-6140 is colored green. The location
of the Asp insertion is indicated by a red sphere, corresponding to
the Cα position, and that of Ser310 by a purple sphere.

Structural Impact of the
Asp Insertion
The primary
goal of determining the structure of PBP2-t3-6140 was to determine
the structural effects of the Asp insertion, which by itself causes
a 6-fold decrease in the rate of acylation by penicillin G and, when
combined with the four C-terminal substitutions, a 15-fold decrease.17 The first observation from the structure is
that the electron density in the immediate vicinity of the insertion
is relatively weak (Figure 5). This is more
pronounced in molecule A than in molecule B and occurs C-terminal
to the existing aspartate (Asp346). It leads to slight uncertainty
in the position of several side chain residues, including the inserted
Asp, Thr347, and His348. Nevertheless, it is clear that the insertion
does not cause disordering of the β-hairpin loop region but
rather introduces only localized flexibility at the insertion site.

electron density is shown, contoured at 1σ: (A) molecule A and
(B) molecule B.

A second observation
is that the insertion is best described functionally
as an Asp346a insertion. As shown by superimposition with the structure
of wild-type PBP2 (Figure 6), the structural
shift occurs after Asp346, which is essentially unchanged in position
and makes the same hydrogen bonding interaction with Ser363 of the
SxN motif that is present in wild-type PBP2. Finally, the β2a−β2d
hairpin loop has shifted relatively little, with the biggest difference
being a longer loop between β2b and β2c as a result of
the additional residue. Overall, these structural observations agree
closely with our previous mutagenesis data that show the effect of
the Asp insertion to be highly specific.18

The hydrogen bond between Asp346 and Ser363 is shown as a dashed line,
and the inserted Asp is labeled in red.

How Does Asp346a Lower the Rate of Acylation by Penicillin?
Having analyzed the structure, we must now consider how the insertion
contributes to penicillin resistance, i.e., how Asp346a lowers the
rate of acylation by penicillin. We envision two potential mechanisms
that, on the basis of the crystal structure and biochemical data,
could account for the effects of the Asp insertion.

By lengthening
the β2c−β2d loop, the primary effect of the insertion
is to project the new aspartate side chain directly toward the active
site, potentially placing it within hydrogen bonding distance of Asn364.
The latter is part of the SxN active-site motif that is found in all
serine-based PBPs and β-lactamases. The mechanistic role of
Asn364 in both transpeptidation and β-lactam binding is not
entirely clear, but it is required for activity27 and participates in the rich hydrogen bonding environment
within the active site. This network involves both Ser310, which is
the nucleophile that forms the acyl–enzyme bond with peptide
substrates and β-lactam antibiotics, and Lys313, which is believed
to activate the serine nucleophile by functioning in PBPs as a general
base.26,28−30 Although disruption
of the hydrogen bonding network by the inserted Asp might be responsible
for the decreased rates of acylation with β-lactams, the close
overlap of active-site residues in both the wild-type and 6140 structures
of PBP2 shows the hydrogen bonding is essentially the same in the
presence of the insertion (Figure 7). The apparent
flexibility around the Asp insertion site and with it the absence
of a stable hydrogen bond with Asn364 also make this mechanism uncertain.

Figure 7 Stereoview
of a superimposition of the structures of PBP2-t3-6140
and wild-type PBP2 in which a meropenem molecule was docked via superimposition
with a crystal structure of PBP2 in complex with meropenem. Wild-type
PBP2 is colored yellow, PBP2-t3-6140 blue, and meropenem orange. The
hydrogen bond between Asp346 and Ser363 is shown as a dashed line,
and the inserted Asp is labeled in red. The three conserved active-site
motifs of PBPs are labeled in blue.

Another possibility is that the Asp insertion directly hinders
the binding or acylation reaction with β-lactams. To examine
this possibility, we docked meropenem into the structure of PBP2-t3-6140,
using as a guide the crystal structure of the PBP2 acyl–enzyme
complex with meropenem (A. Fedarovich, R. A. Nicholas, and C. Davies,
unpublished observations) (Figure 7). To date,
this is the only structure of an acylated complex of PBP2. The relevance
of this model is supported by the 5-fold lowering of the acylation
rate for meropenem against the 6140 variant of PBP2 compared to that
of the wild type. It shows that although the inserted aspartate does
not reach far enough to clash directly with meropenem, its side chain
lies near the 6-hydroxyethyl group and the opened β-lactam ring.
One possible consequence of the Asp346a mutation, therefore, is that
its negative charge impedes binding of what is predominantly a hydrophobic
region of the antibiotic, i.e., the thiazolidine ring and the ethyl
of the hydroxyethyl group. The region equivalent to the hydroxyethyl
in penicillin G is the benzyl R1 group, and thus, any unfavorable
interaction between a negative charge and a hydrophobic region might
be greater. In support of this, the difference in acylation rates
between the wild type and 6140 variants of PBP2 is greater for penicillin
(15-fold) than for meropenem (5-fold). Finally, it is equally possible
that the proximity of a new negative charge in the active site interferes
with the chemistry of acylation by altering the electrostatic environment
of the active site.

Preservation of TPase Function
A
key question to address
is how TPase function is preserved in the presence of an insertion
of Asp into the active site. Our previous studies have shown that
there is a very fine line between gaining resistance via mutations
that lower the rate of acylation by penicillin and maintaining essential
TPase function in PBP2.18 It is clear that
the integrity of the β2c−β2d loop and its interaction
with the SxN motif via a hydrogen bond between Asp346 and Ser363 are
vital for TPase function and that only subtle changes in this region
can be tolerated. Our structure of PBP2-t3-6140 shows that the β-hairpin
loop (β2a−β2d) is mostly unchanged in structure,
with an only localized impact in the immediate vicinity of the Asp
insertion, and that the hydrogen bond between Ser363 and Asp346 is
preserved, even though the insertion is immediately after Asp346.
The superimposition of wild-type PBP2 with PBP2-t3-6140 (Figure 7) shows that the amino acids comprising the three
conserved motifs of the active site overlap remarkably closely. Thus,
significant remodeling of the active site has not occurred as a result
of the Asp insertion, and the key catalytic residues remain appropriately
positioned for catalysis.

Mutations that contribute to resistance
against β-lactams must not impair binding or acylation of the
peptide substrate. There is a remarkable specificity for an aspartate
insertion at position 346a because only this insertion can contribute
to penicillin resistance without causing irreparable damage to TPase
function.18 In a previous study, we showed
that mutation to alanine of either residue mediating the Ser363–Asp346
hydrogen bond both ablated TPase activity and increased the proteolytic
susceptibility of PBP2, revealing the importance of this connection
for the integrity of the active site, whereas the proteolytic susceptibility
of PBP2-6140 containing the Asp insertion was the same as that of
wild-type PBP2. In a similar manner, we examined the proteolytic susceptibility
of PBP2-6140 with insertions of Glu, Asn, and His at position 346a
(Figure 4 of the Supporting Information). The proteolytic susceptibility of all three of these mutants is
the same as that of wild-type PBP2, showing that, like Asp346a, these
insertions do not decrease the stability of the active-site region.
These data indicate that these mutations impair TPase function by
a specific mechanism, with their side chains presumably interfering
with either the binding or acylation of the peptide substrate. Elucidation
of exactly how Asp346a preserves TPase activity when other insertions
abrogate it, however, must await determination of the structure of
PBP2 in complex with a cell-wall peptide or peptide mimetic.

Conclusion
We have determined the crystal structure of a truncated construct
of N. gonorrhoeae PBP2 containing the Asp345a insertion
implicated in penicillin resistance. The new aspartate is functionally
an Asp346a insertion, as the position of Asp346 is essentially unchanged
from that of the wild type. The inserted side chain points directly
toward the active site, where its negative charge may impede binding
of β-lactams via repulsion against hydrophobic regions of the
antibiotic or more simply alters the acylation chemistry that results
in opening of the β-lactam ring by perturbing the electrostatic
balance around the serine nucleophile.
