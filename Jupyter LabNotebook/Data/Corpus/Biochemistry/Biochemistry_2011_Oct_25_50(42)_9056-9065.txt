The S100 family consists of
a group of about 25 dimeric, calcium-signaling proteins. Calcium binding
to an S100 protein produces a conformational change that exposes a
hydrophobic surface, allowing recruitment of other proteins that leads
to a biological response. Each S100 protein is comprised of two EF-hand
calcium-binding sites per protomer connected by a central linker.
The first site, formed by helix I a calcium-binding loop and helix
II, has relatively weak calcium binding ability.− The second motif
contains helix III–loop–helix IV and has a higher affinity
for calcium. The dimeric nature of the S100 proteins allows them to
bind to two or more target molecules simultaneously. For example,
S100B is a well-characterized member of the family that has been shown
to bind a diverse array of targets, including annexin A6, p53, RAGE,
and NDR kinase.− In addition, S100B has been shown to be a biomarker for brain injury() and is linked to neurological diseases such as
Parkinson’s and schizophrenia.,

Dopamine
D2 receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that transmit the signal
from extracellular dopamine to the cytoplasm in several neuronal cell
types. Downstream targets affected by dopamine binding to the D2 receptor
include adenylate cyclase,() inwardly rectifying
potassium channels,() and voltage activated
N-type calcium channels.() Like S100B,
the D2 receptor has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease
and schizophrenia as well as drug addiction. The dopamine D2 receptor
contains seven transmembrane domains and has the ability to dimerize.() There are several different types of dopamine
receptor that are classified based on the sequence of their third
cytoplasmic loop (IC3) that connects the membrane spanning α5
and α6 helices. The dopamine D2 receptor IC3 is also the main
site of interaction for several proteins including calmodulin() and GTP-coupled proteins giving rise to a variety
of signal transduction events.

Calcium dependence is a defining
characteristic of S100B interactions. For example, S100B binds to
p53 in a calcium-dependent manner and inhibits p53 function, promoting
cell survival.() The NMR solution structure
of Ca2+-S100B with a bound p53-derived peptide shows the
p53 adopts an α-helical conformation and binds to helices III
and IV of S100B along a flat hydrophobic pocket.() This same calcium-dependent interaction is also observed
for NDR kinase, and TRTK peptides., Recent work identified S100B as a potential binding partner of the
dopamine D2 receptor using a bacterial two-hybrid assay.() This result was surprising as live-cell based
two-hybrid assays typically have not been amenable to the search for
binding partners of calcium-binding proteins.() This caveat is one of the major hurdles in studying calcium-signaling
networks. In the case of the bacterial two-hybrid assay intracellular
free calcium in E. coli is tightly regulated between
100 and 300 nM,, well below the reported calcium
dissociation constants for S100B (Kd ∼
20–60 μM) and most other S100 proteins.,, This suggests the interaction
of S100B with the D2 receptor interaction could be calcium independent.
It was also demonstrated that S100B could enhance D2 receptor downstream
events in HEK293 cells,() although the
role of calcium in this interaction is not yet fully understood. Resting
calcium concentrations in mammalian cell types are also well below
the S100B dissociation constant for calcium.() One suggestion is that S100B might be required for efficient surface
presentation of receptors, like the dopamine D2 receptor, on the plasma
membrane.() In a similar case S100A10 has
been shown to bind to serotonin receptors and annexin A2, allowing
them to be targeted to lipid domains in the plasma membrane. Interestingly,
S100A10 knockout mice display depression like symptoms, a phenotype
linked to problems in the serotonin-signaling pathway.()

In this work we used gel filtration, peptide array,
and NMR experiments to understand the mechanisms of interaction between
S100B and the dopamine D2 receptor. In particular, we examined the
ability of calcium to modulate this interaction and identified the
regions on both S100B and the D2 receptor required for complex formation.
The work shows that S100B binding to the receptor is localized to
the C-terminus of the IC3 loop. Interestingly, there is a clear, albeit
weak association between S100B and the IC3 in the absence of calcium,
and this association is strongly enhanced upon calcium binding to
S100B.

Experimental Procedures
Protein Constructs and Purification
Expression and
purification of unlabeled and uniformly 15N-labeled S100B
were completed as described previously., The purified
protein was thoroughly dialyzed against multiple changes of EDTA-containing
buffer to remove all calcium, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0.
The apo-S100B protein was then dialyzed into a 3 mM KCl solution at
pH 8.0, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C.

A construct
containing residues R217-Q345 (IC3) from the D2S dopamine receptor
was a generous gift from K. Neve (Oregon Health and Science University,
Portland, OR).() This region, containing
the entire IC3 as identified by TM-Finder,() was moved into a p11 plasmid (Structural Genomics Consortium-Toronto)
containing a TEV protease cleavable His6 purification tag.
A synthetic gene construct covering residues S288-Q345 of the D2S
receptor (IC3-C58) and containing a TEV protease cleavable His6 tag was synthesized (DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, CA) and placed
in a pJ404 plasmid under control of the T5 promoter. Synthetic peptides
comprising residues R217-K241 (IC3-N25), S288-I315 (IC3-M28), and
Q316-Q345 (IC3-C30) were purchased (Biobasic, ON, Canada). Purity
of the peptides (&gt;95%) was confirmed by HPLC and ESI-MS.

His6-IC3 and His6-IC3-C58 proteins were expressed
and purified in identical manners. BL21 DE3 E. coli cells containing the appropriate construct plasmid were grown in
Luria Broth with ampicillin at 37 °C to an OD600 of
0.6. Protein expression was induced for 6 h with addition of 1 mM
IPTG. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet
was resuspended in 50 mM NaH2PO4 and 500 mM
NaCl at pH 8.0 (Buffer A). Cells were lysed using a French pressure
cell, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 38 000
rpm for 1 h. The lysate was then applied to a HiTrap Ni2+ FastFlow column (5 mL) (G.E. Healthcare, QC, Canada) equilibrated
in Buffer A. The column was washed to a steady baseline with 10 column
volumes of Buffer A supplemented with 62.5 mM imidazole. Proteins
were step eluted with Buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions
containing purified proteins were pooled and TEV protease was added
in a 1:100 ratio based on amount of protein in the pooled fractions.
During TEV cleavage the protein was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C
into Buffer A to remove imidazole. Protein solutions were reapplied
to a HiTrap Ni2+ FastFlow column (5 mL) (G.E. Healthcare,
QC, Canada), and the flow-through, containing the cleaved IC3 or IC3-C58
proteins, was collected. Further protein purification was achieved
using a HiTrap S-HP column (5 mL) (G.E. Healthcare, QC, Canada) and
a linear salt gradient. The final purified proteins were verified
by SDS-PAGE and ESI-MS. From ESI-MS the mass obtained for the IC3
was 15 295.7 ± 0.7 Da, which corresponds closely to the
calculated mass of 15 293.5 Da. The mass obtained for IC3-C58
was 6781.9 ± 0.1 Da, which corresponds well to the calculated
mass of 6780.7 Da.

Pull-Down Assays
For pull-down experiments His6-IC3 was exhaustively dialyzed into 50 mM Tris-HCl, 200 mM
NaCl, 0.2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at pH 7.5. All buffers
and protein solutions were treated with Chelex resin to ensure the
complete removal of contaminating calcium. S100B and IC3 proteins
(75 μM) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio (S100B protomer:IC3) in the
presence and absence of 2 mM calcium and incubated at ambient temperature
for 1 h. Ni2+-NTA spin columns (Qiagen, ON, Canada) were
equilibrated in dialysis buffer prior to addition of the S100B/IC3
mixture (600 μL). Spin columns were then washed three times
with dialysis buffer and eluted with 600 μL of dialysis buffer
supplemented with 500 mM imidazole. Samples were taken of the applied,
unbound, and eluted fractions and run on SDS-PAGE gels, which were
then stained with Coomassie blue dye.

Peptide Array Experiments
Lyophilized S100B protein
(100 μM) was resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl at
pH 7.0 (TBS). Solutions and proteins were supplemented with either
10 mM EDTA or 1 mM calcium depending on whether calcium-free (apo)
or calcium-saturated S100B was needed. A G-25 desalting column (10
mL, GE Healthcare, QC, Canada) was washed with H2O and
then equilibrated in TBS. The column was loaded with S100B (1 mL),
and the two most concentrated fractions (0.5 mL) were pooled for further
experiments. A solution of Alexa-Fluor 680 C2-maleimide (Invitrogen,
ON, Canada) in methanol (5 mM, 100 μL) was prepared and mixed
with 100 μL of TBS. A portion of this solution (100 μL)
was transferred to the pooled S100B protein solution and gently mixed
for 2 h at room temperature. The solution was passed through a G-25
desalting column; fractions containing the Alexa-S100B protein were
collected and dialyzed exhaustively into TBS to remove any free Alexa-Fluor
680. The final concentration of Alexa-S100B was determined using the
Alexa-Fluor 680 extinction coefficient (ε679 nm = 184 000).

Peptide arrays were synthesized by FMOC
chemistry using an Auto-Spot Robot ASP222 (Amimed) on nitrocellulose
membranes., Sequential peptides of the IC3 were spotted
on each array membrane. Two arrays, using peptides 18 amino acid residues
in length and stepping through the IC3 sequence by either one or two
residues, were created producing two nonidentical but overlapping
arrays. Each array was washed with methanol followed by TBS supplemented
with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-Tween). Membranes were blocked using either
TBS-Tween with 5% w/v skim milk powder (blocking buffer) for Ca2+-S100B experiments, or 1X Blocker (Pierce, ON, Canada) in
TBS-Tween for apo-S100B experiments, followed by washing with TBS-Tween.
Alexa-S100B (0.05 μM protomer) was diluted into blocking buffer
and incubated with each array for 2 h at room temperature. In each
case, the solution was removed and the array washed several times
with TBS-Tween. Arrays were imaged using an Odyssey imaging system
(LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).

Gel Filtration Experiments
Purified S100B and IC3-C58
proteins were dialyzed into buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150
mM NaCl at pH 7.4. S100B and IC3-C58 were mixed in a 1:1 ratio (50
μM protomer, 500 μL) and supplemented with either 10 mM
EDTA or 1 mM CaCl2 for calcium-free or calcium-saturated
experiments. A Superdex G75 analytical gel filtration column (1 cm
× 30 cm) (GE Healthcare, QC, Canada) was equilibrated with buffer
prior to sample injections (500 μL) of the S100B/IC3-C58 solution.
An elution rate of 0.5 mL/min was maintained, monitored at 280 nm.
Since S100B and IC3-C58 proteins absorb poorly at 280 nm, the collected
fractions (0.5 mL) were assessed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie
blue dye.

NMR Titration Experiments of S100B and IC3
All NMR
experiments were performed at 35 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz
spectrometer with pulsed-field gradient triple resonance probe. Protein
solutions were prepared in 50 mM MOPS, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM
DTT, and 5 mM NaN3 at pH 7.0 in 90% H2O/10%
D2O using DSS as an internal reference. In addition, imidazole
was added as an internal pH standard to ensure the sample pH was maintained
during titrations.() Samples contained
either apo-S100B (200 μM protomer) or Ca2+-S100B
(100 μM protomer). Ca2+-S100B experiments contained
6 mM calcium chloride. Apo-S100B experiments used EDTA-treated protein,
and all buffers were treated with Chelex resin (BioRad, ON, Canada)
to remove any free calcium. In all experiments concentrated stocks
of peptides (IC3-C58, IC3-N25, IC3-M28, and IC3-C30) were made up
in the appropriate buffer (with and without calcium), identical to
that of the S100B protein. S100B protein concentrations were determined
by amino acid analysis (The Hospital for Sick Children-Amino Acid
Analysis Facility, Toronto) done on triplicate samples with peaks
corresponding to alanine and leucine used to calibrate protein concentration.

Titration experiments were monitored using sensitivity-enhanced 1H–15N HSQC spectra collected for each addition
of peptide.() Spectra were collected with
1024 complex points in the 1H dimension and 64 increments
in the 15N dimension. Data were processed using NMRPipe() and analyzed using NMRViewJ.() Titrations were followed using additions of the appropriate
peptide solution until a minimum of 2.0 equiv of peptide per S100B
subunit had been added. In all cases, the volume of added peptide
was less than 10% of the total starting sample volume (600 μL).
The change in chemical shift for selected peaks in the Ca2+-S100B spectrum with each addition of peptide was determined as Δδ
= [(Δ1H2) + ((Δ15N/5)2)]1/2.() To reduce measurement
errors in the relatively small apo-S100B chemical shifts, only the
change in proton chemical shift was used during fitting. Titration
binding data were fit according to the equationwhere Pt is the
total S100B protein concentration, Lt is
the total IC3 ligand peptide concentration, Kd is the dissociation constant, and N is the
maximum chemical shift change upon ligand binding. A global Kd value was calculated for each peptide titration
by simultaneously fitting the chemical shifts from six different residues
in Ca2+-S100B or ten different residues in apo-S100B to
the above model.

Results
In the dopamine receptor family the third cytoplasmic
loop (IC3) defines the receptor subtype and is known to mediate cytoplasmic
protein interactions between the dopamine receptor and the rest of
the signaling pathway. There are two isoforms of the D2 receptor,
which vary by a 29 amino acid insertion in the IC3, the D2S (short,
IC3-129 residues), and the D2L (long, IC3-158 residues). Both the
D2L and D2S variants of the IC3 have been shown to interact in a similar
manner with S100B,() indicating that the
insertion in the D2L receptor is not likely involved in the recognition
of S100B. Therefore, for simplicity the D2S isoform of the IC3 region
covering residues R217-Q345 of the transmembrane receptor was utilized
in this study (Figure ). Structural information
about this region of the D2 dopamine receptor is not available. The
IC3 is highly basic and has a pI of 11.5. The crystal structure of
the closely related D3 dopamine receptor does not contain electron
density in the region of the IC3, and crystals were obtained only
when the majority of the D3-IC3 was removed.() This suggests that the IC3 is present as a flexible loop and mediates
protein interactions mostly through contiguous stretches in its sequence.

Schematic
diagram of the dopamine peptides used for S100B binding experiments.
The amino acid sequence for the third cytoplasmic loop of the dopamine
D2S receptor (IC3) is shown (R217-Q345). Regions within the IC3 that
were expressed from E. coli or synthesized as peptides
are indicated by bars above the protein sequence near the N-terminus
(IC3-N25) and C-terminus (IC3-C58, IC3-M28, IC3-C30).

Apo- and Calcium-Bound S100B Interact with IC3
The
hexahistidine-tagged IC3 (His6-IC3) was expressed and purified
from E. coli for structural analysis and interaction
with S100B. The IC3 yield was low, and the protein was prone to proteolysis.
Nevertheless, a sufficient quantity of purified protein was obtained
to test the interaction between S100B and the IC3 using a Ni2+ pull-down assay. Given that S100B is a calcium-binding protein that
interacts with its binding partners in a calcium-dependent manner,
the binding of S100B with IC3 was examined in the absence and presence
of calcium. His6-IC3 was bound to Ni2+-resin
spin columns in the presence of apo- and Ca2+-S100B. Bound
proteins were eluted from the column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure ). His6-IC3 protein was found to coelute
with Ca2+-S100B from the Ni2+ column. Interestingly,
even in the absence of calcium, apo-S100B bound to His6-IC3, although to a lesser extent than Ca2+-S100B. This
indicates that both apo- and Ca2+-S100B were able to bind
with the IC3 region of the dopamine D2 receptor.

Interaction of IC3 with
S100B from affinity chromatography. The SDS-PAGE gel in the top panel
shows His6-IC3 (lanes 1–3) and apo-S100B (lanes
4–6) loaded on the Ni2+ resin column (lanes 1, 4)
and the wash fraction (lanes 2, 5) followed by elution with excess
imidazole (lanes 3, 6). In the bottom panel purified apo-S100B (lanes
1–3) and Ca2+-S100B (lanes 4–6) were incubated
together with His6-IC3 and applied to Ni2+ resin
(lanes 1, 4), washed from the resin as unbound fractions (lanes 2,
5), and bound protein eluted (lanes 3, 6) with excess imidazole containing
buffer.

Identification of IC3 Binding Regions with S100B
The
IC3 loop from the dopamine D2 receptor is much larger than typical
S100B binding partners previously identified. Therefore, it is likely
that a smaller portion of the IC3 is involved in the interaction with
S100B and experiments were conducted to delineate the interaction
site(s) more precisely. To determine the region of IC3 that binds
to S100B peptide array experiments were conducted using a nested series
of 18-residue sequences linked to a nitrocellulose membrane. The first
peptide of the arrays corresponded to residues R217-A234 of the D2S
receptor, the N-terminal 18 residues of the IC3. Two different arrays
were constructed in which subsequent 18-residue peptides continued
to step through the IC3 by either one or two amino acids. Both array
types were probed for binding to either apo-S100B or Ca2+-S100B, labeled with Alexa-Fluor 680 at position C84, previously
shown to be benign to target protein binding when fluorescently labeled.() The results of the array that stepped through
the IC3 region by two residues at a time (Figure ) showed that both apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B were
able to bind to the IC3 region of the D2 receptor. In addition, the
pattern of peptides from the IC3 that bound to apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B was very similar. These observations were confirmed
with arrays that stepped through the IC3 sequence by one residue.
It is interesting that the peptide arrays did not show obvious differences
in affinity between apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B that were
observed in the pull-down experiments. This is likely due to the relatively
high local concentrations of peptide on each spot and the concentrations
of S100B protein needed to visualize a positive interaction. In combination
with the different buffer conditions used in the apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B arrays it has been shown that this makes comparison
of spot intensities as a means for relative affinities difficult.()

Representative peptide arrays of the IC3 regions probed
with S100B. The 129-residue sequence of IC3 was arrayed on cellulose
membranes and probed with fluorescently labeled S100B in the (A) absence
and (B) presence of calcium. These arrays consist of 18-residue peptides
synthesized at each spot on the membrane and stepping through the
IC3 sequence two residues at a time. The coordinates of each spot
on the arrays are identified by row (A, B, C) and column numbers (1,
2, 3) beside and above the arrays, respectively. (C) An example of
the peptide sequence progression from spot to spot is shown using
the array coordinates (E7–E10, F1). S100B was fluorescently
labeled with Alexa Fluor 680 at position C84 and then used to treat
the membranes in the presence of (A) EDTA or (B) calcium. Red fluorescence
is indicative of bound S100B protein.

The most intense binding was observed for peptide
F1 in both the apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B arrays. A closer
analysis of the array data revealed two distinct binding regions in
the IC3, which were selected for further study. The major region covered
the C-terminal 58 amino acids (IC3-C58), denoted by peptides D6-F7.
A second minor region identified from a single spot (A3) on the arrays
included the N-terminal 25 residues of the IC3 (IC3-N25). A large
area comprising residues K241-S288 (A6-D5) from the IC3 exhibited
very little observable fluorescence for both apo- or Ca2+-S100B, indicating this region of IC3 is not a major interacting
site for S100B. Further analysis of the IC3-C58 region from the peptide
array experiments showed that it could be subdivided into two smaller
regions demonstrating more intense S100B binding, separated by a small
region with weaker binding (E1-E5). The C-terminal 30 residues of
the IC3 (IC3-C30) (E10-F7) and the 28-residue region adjacent to it
(IC3-M28) (D6-E1) peptides split the IC3-C58 region close to the middle.
Because the array sequences contain overlapping peptides, the region
E2-E9 is represented in both IC3-C30 and IC3-M28 peptides. This series
of four peptides (Figure ) was used to identify
the binding locations of IC3 on both apo- and Ca2+-S100B
as well as the strength of the interactions.

Disordered IC3-C58 Interacts with S100B
The IC3-C58
peptide was expressed, purified, and analyzed by circular dichroism
(CD) spectropolarimetry. The resulting spectrum showed one region
of stronger ellipticity near 200 nm, typical of a disordered protein
(data not shown). In addition, a 1H–15N HSQC spectrum collected using 15N-labeled IC3-C58 showed
the majority of the peaks were very intense and collapsed into a small
central region centered between 7.1 and 8.0 ppm (1H shifts,
data not shown). These data show that IC3-C58 is disordered in solution
and lacks regular secondary structure.

The formation of complexes
between IC3-C58 and both apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B was examined
using gel filtration chromatography. Mixtures of S100B and IC3-C58
proteins were applied to an analytical gel filtration column in the
presence of either EDTA (apo-S100B) or excess CaCl2. Since
S100B and IC3-C58 have poor absorbance characteristics at 280 nm,
fractions were collected from the gel filtration column and examined
by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis, providing a clear image of the proteins
and potential complexes (Figure ). The data
showed that S100B, in the absence of IC3-C58, eluted at an earlier
volume than the D2 receptor protein, consistent with the larger dimeric
nature of S100B (21 kDa) compared to IC3-C58 (6.5 kDa). When the IC3-C58
and Ca2+-S100B proteins were combined a notable shift to
a higher molecular weight was noted for both proteins consistent with
complex formation between the proteins. In the absence of calcium,
a reproducible shift to higher molecular weight was also observed
although this was not as obvious as with IC3-C58 and Ca2+-S100B. As with the peptide array experiments, these results indicate
that apo-S100B can interact with the C-terminal 58 residues of the
D2 IC3 region. However, the interaction is considerably stronger upon
calcium binding to S100B.

Identification of the S100B-IC3 complex by gel
filtration. Bacterially expressed and purified IC3-C58 was preincubated
with either apo-S100B or Ca2+-S100B and loaded on an analytical
Superdex-75 gel filtration column. Eluted fractions were collected
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The top two panels show
the individual apo-S100B and IC3-C58 proteins. The bottom two panels
show the mixture in the presence of 10 mM EDTA (apo-S100B) or 1 mM
CaCl2 (Ca2+-S100B).

IC3-C58 Binds to Ca2+-S100B with High Affinity
The peptide array experiments identified distinct regions near
the N-terminus (IC3-N25) and C-terminus (IC3-C58) in the IC3 that
interact with S100B. In order to verify these interactions and determine
the strengths of the interactions with S100B, titrations of the individual
peptides with apo- and Ca2+-S100B were monitored by NMR
spectroscopy. These experiments also allow detailed information about
the regions of S100B involved in the interaction with IC3 to be identified.
Figure  shows that in the absence of calcium
several residues in S100B underwent small chemical shift changes (&lt;0.1
ppm) upon addition of IC3-C58. These included residues V52, K55, V56,
M57, and T59 in helix III and M79, V80, A83, E89, and E91 in helix
IV. All chemical shifts observed were in the fast exchange regime.
Using a global fitting approach for 1:1 binding between IC3-C58 and
an S100B protomer, changes in chemical shift were fit simultaneously
to eq  to obtain a Kd of 274 ± 58 μM (Figure C).

Interaction
of IC3-C58 with apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B identified by
NMR spectroscopy. 1H–15N HSQC spectra
of (A) 15N-labeled apo-S100B (200 μM) in the absence
(black) and presence (red) of IC3-C58 peptide and (B) Ca2+-S100B (100 μM) in the absence (black) and presence (red) of
IC3-C58 peptide. In both spectra residues affected by the addition
of IC3-C58 are labeled. Dotted circles indicate residues that have
shifted from their original positions but could not be located in
the S100B-IC3-C58 complex. Chemical shift changes for selected residues
in (C) apo-S100B and (D) Ca2+-S100B plotted as a function
of IC3-C58 concentration and globally fit to provide dissociation
constants (Kd) of 274 ± 58 and 1
± 1 μM, respectively.

In contrast to the interaction between apo-S100B
and IC3-C58, titrations between IC3-C58 and Ca2+-S100B
led to much larger chemical shift changes in the 1H–15N HSQC spectra (Figure B). The largest
chemical shift changes in Ca2+-S100B were noted for A9,
D12, Q16, and S18 (helix I), V52, V56, and T59 (helix III), and A75,
F76, A78, V80, and A83 (helix IV). Similar to apo-S100B, the changes
in chemical shift for Ca2+-S100B appeared in the fast or
fast-intermediate exchange regime allowing assignment of Ca2+-S100B bound to IC3-C58 to be completed based on previous assignments.() In addition, all changes in chemical shifts
appeared to be linear, suggesting only a single binding event was
occurring (, Figure
S1). Global fitting of the titration data for several residues found
in different regions (helix I, linker, helices III, IV) of the S100B
protein yielded an approximate Kd near
1 μM for the interaction of IC3-C58 with each Ca2+-S100B protomer (Figure D). This indicates
that the affinity for IC3-C58 is ∼300-fold higher for Ca2+-S100B compared to apo-S100B.

Titrations of IC3-N25
into either apo-S100B or Ca2+-S100B resulted in no significant
changes in the 1H–15N HSQC spectra (data
not shown). Although peptide array experiments were suggestive of
an interaction with S100B the titration indicates that the affinity
is very weak. It is important to note that only a single peptide spot
displayed observable binding in the IC3-N25 region of peptide arrays
(for example, Figure ), even with a large
excess of free S100B used in the array experiments, while large contiguous
peptide regions were observed for IC3-C58 binding to S100B. These
results indicate that the C-terminal portion of the IC3 for the dopamine
D2 receptor is the major site of interaction with S100B, and this
interaction is accentuated upon calcium binding to the S100 protein.

Evidence for Multiple Binding Regions in IC3 for Ca2+-S100B
Structures of different S100 proteins bound to peptides
representing protein target-binding regions vary from 12 (TRTK-12)
to 30 (Siah1-interacting protein, SIP) residues., At 58 residues, the IC3-C58 region would, therefore, be considered
an unusually large S100B binding region. Since peptide array experiments
suggested two separate binding areas (IC3-M28, IC3-C30) might exist
within the IC3-C58 region, we used peptides for both regions (Figure ) to determine how these might contribute to binding
with S100B. In both cases, no significant chemical shift changes were
observed in apo-S100B despite addition of excess IC3-M28 or IC3-C30
peptides (data not shown).

The titration of IC3-M28 to Ca2+-S100B showed several changes in the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum (Figure A and  Figure S2) although in
general the magnitude of the chemical shift changes were smaller than
observed for IC3-C58. Titrations with the IC3-C30 peptide and Ca2+-S100B produced very similar results (Figure B and  Figure
S3). Interestingly many of the affected residues in Ca2+-S100B were the same for both IC3-C30 and IC3-M28 peptides including
A9, D12, S41, V56, A78, A83, and C84. The chemical shift changes for
multiple residues in each of these peptides were globally fit to determine
dissociation constants of ∼98 and ∼148 μM for
binding of IC3-C30 and IC3-M28, respectively, to Ca2+-S100B
(Figure ). These values are nearly 2 orders
of magnitude higher than observed for IC3-C58. Since the overall trends
for residues that shifted in Ca2+-S100B were very similar
for IC3-C58 and its subpeptides IC3-M28 and IC3-C30 ( Figure S4), attempts were also made
to fit the data for 2:1 stoichiometry (i.e., two IC3-M28 peptides
to each Ca2+-S100B protomer) assuming that each peptide
might bind to two different regions akin to the intact IC3-C58 peptide.
Attempts to fit to this model yielded similar affinities with poor
fits and large errors likely a result of the overall weak affinity
of these individual peptides for Ca2+-S100B. Nevertheless,
the low affinity of IC3-M28 and IC3-C30 suggest that regions within
both peptides contribute to the higher affinity binding of IC3-C58.

Dotted circles indicate residues that have shifted from their original

Chemical shift changes (Δδ) for indicated residues in
Ca2+-S100B were plotted as a function of (C) IC3-M28 and
(D) IC3-C30 concentrations. Global fitting was completed for 1:1 binding
using the residues indicated between each peptide and the S100 protomer
as described in the  section. This yielded dissociation constants (Kd) of 149 ± 26 μM for IC3-M28 and 98 ±
12 μM for IC3-C30. Attempts to fit the data for 2:1 binding
(2 peptides per protomer) yielded similar results with larger errors.

Identification of the IC3 Binding Surface on S100B
The magnitudes of the chemical shift changes for binding of IC3-C58
to Ca2+-S100B and apo-S100B were used to identify the surface
of interaction for the IC3 with S100B (Figure ). For apo-S100B the only contiguous area of residues experiencing
relatively large chemical shift changes was located on helices III
and IV. However, several of these residues are not surface accessible
in the apo-S100B structure including V52, V56, F76, V80, and A83.
It may be possible that apo-S100B is undergoing a ligand-induced conformational
change upon presentation of IC3-C58, a finding noted previously for
the interaction of apo-calmodulin with the cardiac sodium channel
NaV1.5() or myosin.() The discontinuity of the surface for IC3-C58 binding
to apo-S100B is in agreement with the lower binding affinity observed.

Potential
binding surfaces for the IC3 region of the dopamine D2 receptor mapped
to the surfaces of apo-S100B and Ca2+-S100B. Residues in
the dimeric structures of (A) apo-S100B (2PRU)() and (B) Ca2+-S100B (1MQ1)() that shifted more than 0.25 standard deviations above the
average chemical shift change in IC3-C58 titrations are indicated
in different shades of red to denote the two protomers in the S100B
dimer. Only residues for one protomer are labeled.

The interaction of IC3-C58 with Ca2+-S100B shows a contiguous interaction surface is formed at the junction
of helices III and IV of S100B, typical for many S100 target–protein
interactions. Some of these residues, including V56 (helix III) and
F76, M79, V80, A83, and E89 (helix IV), were also affected in apo-S100B
upon IC3-C58 interaction. In addition, there is a smaller region of
interaction on the opposite face of Ca2+-S100B, running
along the solvent exposed side of helix I composed of residues A9,
I11, D12, and Q16. This region on helix I is found in each of the
Ca2+-S100B IC3-peptide titrations (IC3-C58, IC3-C30, IC3-M28)
and is similar to a binding surface found on Ca2+-S100A6
for Siah 1 interacting protein (SIP) binding.() The two distinct regions of chemical shift changes on Ca2+-S100B may indicate that IC3 utilizes two binding sites.

Discussion
Characterization of S100B-IC3 Binding
A variety of
three-dimensional structures have shown that calcium-binding to most
S100 proteins results in a conformational change that exposes a hydrophobic
binding pocket used to recruit target protein partners.,,,,, Although S100B
has been observed to interact with a wide variety of proteins, most
of these have been identified from in vitro experiments. In vivo interactions derived from two-hybrid or co-immunoprecipitation
experiments tend to work poorly for S100B and most other EF-hand containing
proteins due to the calcium-binding requirement.() The recent identification of the dopamine D2 receptor as
an S100B target protein using a bacterial two-hybrid assay() presents one of the first cases where a binding
partner for S100B has been identified using these methods. Since intracellular
free calcium is tightly regulated near 100–300 nM in E. coli(,) and 100–200 nM in humans,() well below the calcium dissociation constants
for most S100 proteins, this suggested that S100B might be interacting
with the dopamine D2 receptor in the calcium-free state.

Peptide
array, gel filtration, and NMR titration experiments identified the
C-terminal portion of the dopamine D2 receptor IC3 loop (IC3-C58)
as the major interacting site with both apo- or Ca2+-S100B.
Sequence alignments of IC3-C58 with S100B binding sequences from p53,
NDR kinase, and TRTK-12 showed there are no clear sequence similarities
in any of these peptides other than a basic pI and several hydrophobic
residues in the sequences. A TRTK consensus sequence, at the N-terminus of the IC3() is apparent,
although this region (IC3-N25) showed little binding to S100B. This
observation is consistent with the ability of S100B to bind multiple,
diverse targets with little sequence similarity.

A Unique Interaction of IC3 with Apo-S100B
The affinity
of the interaction between apo-S100B and the IC3-C58 region of the
dopamine D2 receptor was ∼274 μM. This binding affinity
is similar to those measured for some other apo- and Ca2+-S100 protein interactions including apo-S100A4 and F-actin (∼550
μM),() apo-S100P and melittin (residues
1–26, ∼200 μM),() apo-S100A12
and the receptor for advanced glycated end-products (RAGE) (residues
129–336, ∼140 μM),() Ca2+-S100B with the N-terminus of p53 (residues 1–29, Kd ∼ 76 μM), and Ca2+-S100A2 with p53 (residues 362–393, Kd ∼ 106 μM).() In addition,
several well-studied protein–protein interactions have been
identified for calmodulin, an EF-hand protein structurally distinct
from S100B, which in the calcium-free state often binds to proteins
that contain short IQ motifs (consensus – (I/L/V)Q(X)3R(X)4(R/K),
X = any residue).() These apo-calmodulin
interactions include an IQ motif in neurogranin (Kd ∼ 60 μM),() the
IQ motif in Purkinje cell protein 4 (PEP-19) (Kd ∼13 μM),() and the
IQ motif from the cardiac sodium channel NaV1.5 (∼0.2
μM).() The solution structure of
CaM bound to the NaV1.5 IQ motif() reveals that IQ binding has partially opened the CaM binding site
to an intermediate position and the IQ motif has moved into the hydrophobic
binding pocket. This ligand induced conformational change may also
be occurring when IC3-C58 binds to apo-S100B, as indicated by the
chemical shift changes of buried residues, particularly in helices
III and IV. A search of the D2-IC3 sequence did not reveal any obvious
sequence similarity to the IQ motif. These observations indicate that
the dopamine D2 receptor likely interacts with apo-S100B in a unique
manner from the IQ motif interaction with calmodulin and support a
calcium-free recruitment suggested from bacterial two-hybrid experiments.()

Calcium Enhancement of IC3 Binding to S100B
Gel filtration
and NMR experiments indicated that calcium-binding to S100B leads
to an ∼300-fold increase in affinity for IC3-C58 compared to
the apo-state. The affinity (Kd ∼
1 μM) is similar to interactions of Ca2+-S100B with
SIP (Kd ∼ 5 μM),() TRTK-12 (Kd ∼
0.3 μM),() myelin-associated glycoprotein
(Kd ∼ 7 μM),() and guanylate cyclase (Kd ∼
2 μM).() Separation of IC3-C58 into
two smaller regions, IC3-C30 and IC3-M28, reduces this binding by
∼100-fold, indicating that at least a portion of each of these
regions is required for optimal interaction. This observation is similar
to that observed by Lee and co-workers for the interaction of Ca2+-S100A6 with the C-terminus of SIP.() In this structure, SIP forms a tandem two-helix arrangement where
one helix (helix A) binds in the hydrophobic surface between helix
III and helix IV of Ca2+-S100A6, while the second helix
(helix B) makes contacts with helix I on the opposite face of S100A6.
Both helices of SIP are needed for maximal binding since helix A shows
reduced binding to Ca2+-S100A6 and helix B does not have
any observable binding. The surface of Ca2+-S100B displays
similar features as SIP for the interaction with IC3-C58 having the
largest changes in chemical shift near helices I, III, and IV. This
ability of Ca2+-S100B to function in complex formation
with more than one protein region may also be important for the recruitment
of multiple target proteins. For example, S100A10 and S100A11 can
bind annexin A1 and A2 in combination with membrane spanning proteins
dysferlin, NS3, or TASK-1 to function in membrane repair.− The current observations suggest that the S100B interaction with
the dopamine D2 receptor may fall into this class of S100 binding.

The recognition of the IC3 loop from the dopamine D2 receptor by
apo-S100B may represent a new type of calcium-insensitive target interaction
for an S100 protein. For dopamine signaling this association may provide
an rapid response to calcium and enhanced formation of the S100B-IC3
complex. For example, it has been shown that the calcium affinities
of S100B, and S100A1, can be increased
in the presence of a target protein. Alternatively, it is possible
that calcium binding to S100B results in inactivation of the dopamine
receptor through altered binding since S100B can increase D2 receptor
stimulation of the dopamine-signaling pathway in HEK293 cells() at resting calcium concentrations. This idea
fits well with the observation that calcium-activated calmodulin can
interact with the IC3-N25 region of the dopamine D2 receptor, resulting
in reduced signaling.() Calcium is also
known to reduce intracellular cAMP, which is normally up-regulated
when dopamine binds to the D2 receptor, by inhibiting adenyl cyclase
type V and activating CaM-sensitive phosphodiesterases., The current work identifies the region of the dopamine D2 receptor
recruited by both apo- and Ca2+-S100B and paves the way
for future biochemical studies to elucidate the mechanism of these
interactions in the signaling pathway.
