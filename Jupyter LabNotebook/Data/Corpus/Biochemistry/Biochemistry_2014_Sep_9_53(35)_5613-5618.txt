The recent demonstration of
efficacy of a CFTR potentiator in patients carrying at least one copy
of G551D CFTR was a quantum leap for CF therapy, being the first instance
of a therapeutic intervention based on a small molecule that directly
targets the mutant gene product.− The potentiator, VX-770, known as Ivacaftor or Kalydeco,
did not exhibit similar efficacy in patients homozygous for the more
common mutation, ΔF508, however. This difference could be attributed to the well-established difference
in the molecular phenotypes of the two mutations, namely, a gating
defect for G551D and a combined trafficking and gating defect for
ΔF508, but we wondered if the two
mutants might also differ with regard to the more recently established
mutant CFTR phenotype of thermal instability.

Results from three
laboratories provided strong evidence that the
channel function of ΔF508 CFTR exhibits severe thermal instability.
In Xenopus oocytes and
HEK cells, conductance due to ΔF508
CFTR channels rescued at the surface by low temperature and activated
by PKA and ATP rapidly decreased if the temperature was increased
to 37 °C, an effect that could be traced to a reduction in open
probability. A similar thermal instability was detected in ΔF508
CFTR channels reconstituted in planar bilayers., This
severe gating defect, manifest at temperatures in excess of ∼28
°C, was rescued to varying extents by single and multiple, second-site suppressor mutations.
The apparent disparity in clinical efficacy of VX-770 in compound
heterozygotes (ΔF508/G551D) carrying one copy of G551D CFTR, and a G551D homozygote carrying two copies of G551D CFTR, as well as the modest efficacy of VX-770 seen
in ΔF508 homozygotes, suggested to us that ΔF508 CFTR
channels and G551D CFTR channels might differ in their thermal stabilities.
Might it be, for example, that the well-known trafficking defect seen
with ΔF508 CFTR is, at least in part, a reflection of thermal
instability apparent in a channel function assay, a thermal instability
that might be lacking in the normally trafficked G551D channels?

We compared the thermal stability of G551D CFTR channels expressed
in Xenopus oocytes with that previously reported
by us for ΔF508 CFTR channels. We found, contrary to our initial
expectations, that G551D CFTR channel function was thermally unstable
at 37 °C, although G551D CFTR channel behavior differed from
that of the ΔF508 channels in several important respects. First,
thermal deactivation was more rapid, although less complete, than
that seen with ΔF508 CFTR. Second, following a 37 °C thermal
challenge, the conductance due to G551D channels recovered almost
fully (85%), in contrast to that seen with ΔF508 channels, which
although variable, was on average 43% of the original conductance.
Most importantly, however, G551D CFTR channels appeared to be protected
from thermal instability at 37 °C by CFTR potentiators, including
VX-770. Furthermore, potentiators also provoked an increase in conductance
due to G551D channels at 37 °C, following thermal deactivation,
a condition more like that in vivo. These results
provide a mechanistic basis for the differing efficacy of VX-770 in
patients carrying G551D and ΔF508 CFTR and have important implications
for the design of assays for small molecule screening.

Materials and
Methods
Mutagenesis and in Vitro Transcription
CFTR mutants were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis method
similar to those reported previously.− The sequences in the
region of the mutation were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. CFTR
cRNAs for Xenopus oocyte injection were synthesized
using the mMessage mMachine T7 Ultra transcription kit (Ambion).

Preparation and Microinjection of Oocytes
Xenopus
laevis oocytes were prepared using methods previously described
in detail., Briefly, oocytes were defolliculated
by mechanical agitation (1–2 h) in a Ca2+-free solution
containing 82.5 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM
HEPES (pH 7.5) with 0.2 Wünsch units/mL Liberase Blendzyme
3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) and maintained
in a modified Barth’s solution containing 88 mM NaCl, 1 mM
KCl, 0.82 mM MgSO4, 0.33 mM Ca(NO3)2 0.41 mM CaCl2, 2.4 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM HEPES-Hemi-Na,
and 250 mg/L Amikacin with 150 mg/L Gentamicin (pH 7.5). Stage V to
VI oocytes were injected with CFTR cRNA plus cRNA encoding the human
β2-adrenergic receptor. The CFTR RNA concentration
was adjusted so that the maximal steady state-stimulated conductance
was less than 200 μS (∼12.5–25 ng/oocyte).

Whole-Cell
Recordings
Individual oocytes were continuously
perfused with Frog Ringer’s solution, which contained 98 mM
NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and
5 mM HEPES-Hemi-Na (pH 7.4). CFTR channels were activated using 10
μM isoproterenol (a β2-adrenergic agonist)
and 1 mM IBMX (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor) as the stimulating cocktail
(Isop+IBMX) to increase the level of intracellular cAMP., The data were acquired using an Oocyte 725 amplifier (Warner) and
the pClamp 8 data acquisition program (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
CA). Oocytes were maintained under the open circuit condition, and
the membrane potential was periodically ramped from −120 to
60 mV over 1.8 s. Data are reported as means ± the standard error
of the mean, and a t test was performed where appropriate.

Temperature Control
The bath temperature was controlled
using a Dual Automatic Temperature Controller (CL-200) and an in-line
solution heater/cooler (SC-20) (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and
monitored in real time using a thermo probe positioned near the oocytes.
The temperature was digitized and recorded using a USB Data Acquisition
Device (DI-158, DATAQ Instruments, Inc., Akron, OH). All experiments
were begun at room temperature (22–23 °C) unless otherwise
specified.

Reagents
Isobutylmethyl xanthine
(IBMX) and isoproterenol
(Isop) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The following compounds
were kindly provided by R. Bridges (Rosalind Franklin University,
Chicago, IL) and The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF): 4-[4-oxo-2-thioxo-3-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)thiazolidin-5-ylidenemethyl]-benzoic
acid (CFTRinh-172 or CF172), 2-[(2-1H-indol-3-ylacetyl)methylamino]-N-(4-isopropylphenyl)-2-phenyl-acetamide (PG-01 or P2),
and 4-methyl-2-(5-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenol
(VRT-532 or P1). Genistein was purchased from TCI America (Portland,
OR). N-(2,4-Di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide
(VX-770 or Ivacaftor) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston,
TX).

Results
G551D Channels Exhibit Thermal Instability
Figure A shows the results of a representative
experiment
in which an oocyte expressing G551D CFTR channels was exposed to an
increase in temperature from 22 to 37 °C for 10 min. The results
of three such experiments are summarized in Figure B. The effect of the thermal challenge was qualitatively similar
to that we previously reported for ΔF508 channels expressed
in Xenopus oocytes, a rapid, transient increase in
conductance followed by a profound reduction, and partial recovery
after the bath temperature was returned to 22 °C. However, there
was a distinct, quantitative difference between the thermal deactivation
of G551D CFTR and that we previously reported for ΔF508 CFTR. The rate of thermal deactivation was more rapid
for the G551D channels [t1/2 = 0.3 min
(±0.04; n = 3) vs 3.7 min (±0.3; n = 11) for ΔF508 channels] (P &lt; 0.05). More striking, however, was the
greater extent of recovery following the thermal challenge, 85 ±
15% (n = 3) for G551D and 43 ± 15% (n = 3) for ΔF508 (P &lt; 0.05). The relatively rapid and nearly complete recovery
of the G551D channels was reminiscent of that seen with ΔF508
channels when the phenylalanine deletion was combined with a nearby,
second-site suppressor mutation like I539T (ΔF508/I539T CFTR). Upon comparison to contemporaneous experiments
with ΔF508 CFTR channels (see Figures  and ), it also appeared that the extent
of thermal deactivation was lower for G551D channels. The conductance
remaining after thermal deactivation, expressed as a percent of the
initial, activated steady state conductance at 22 °C, averaged
40 ± 8.1% (n = 7) for G551D and 7 ± 1.4%
(n = 6) for ΔF508. Taken together, these results
suggested that G551D CFTR channels, despite their rapid, thermal deactivation,
are less severely impacted by the elevated temperature than ΔF508
channels.

Thermal instability of G551D CFTR channels. (A) Following stimulation
[10 μM isoproterenol and 1 mM IBMX (hatched bar and crosshairs)],
an oocyte expressing G551D CFTR was warmed to 37 °C (gray bar
and circles) for 10 min. After recovering at 22 °C, the oocyte
was exposed to 10 μM CF172. (B) Summary of G551D CFTR conductance
before and after thermal deactivation (P &lt; 0.05).
① represents the initial conductance following stimulation.
② is the minimal conductance at 37 °C. To save space,
the period prior to and during CFTR stimulation by the stimulatory
cocktail is not shown. The half-time for G551D CFTR activation averaged
37.2 ± 4 min (n = 18), and the half-time for
ΔF508 CFTR activation under comparable conditions averaged 7.0
± 2.0 min (n = 18). A prolonged half-time for
activation by cAMP is a consistent feature of G551D channels and is
compatible with the long closed times seen in single-channel recordings.

CFTR Potentiators Protect G551D CFTR Channels but Not ΔF508
CFTR Channels from Thermal Deactivation
The unexpected finding
of thermal instability of G551D channel function prompted us to compare
the effects of CFTR potentiators on the two constructs during a 37
°C thermal challenge. In a previous report, we examined the effect
of several potentiators obtained from CFF, VRT-532 (P1), PG-01 (P2),
and Genistein, on the thermal stability of ΔF508 CFTR channel
function. Although each of these compounds
increased conductance due to ΔF508 CFTR channels at 22 °C,
none of them protected ΔF508 CFTR channels from thermal deactivation
at 37 °C. In fact, one of the potentiators (P2) actually exacerbated
both the rate and extent of thermal deactivation at 37 °C. As
illustrated in Figure , however, similar experiments
employing oocytes expressing G551D channels produced dramatically
different results.

Differential effects of CFTR potentiators on the thermal
instability
of G551D CFTR channels. (A) Following stimulation at 22 °C, an
oocyte expressing G551D CFTR was warmed to 37 °C (gray bar and
circles) and then exposed to 10 μM CF172 at 37 °C. Note
the break on the time axis. (B–E) Following stimulation, oocytes
expressing G551D CFTR were exposed to 10 μM VX-770, 10 μM
P2 (PG-01), 50 μM Genistein, and 10 μM P1, respectively,
warmed to 37 °C (gray bar and circles) in the presence of potentiators,
and then exposed to 10 μM CF172 at 37 °C. (F) Summary of
the ratio of conductance at the end of warming (g2) and the initial steady state conductance prior to exposure
to the potentiators (g1). Doses of the
potentiators were chosen on the basis of the maximal concentration
reported in the literature as well as our previous study.,,− With respect
to the activated conductance prior to the application of potentiator,
the P values for stimulation by Genistein, P1, P2,
and VX770 are all &lt;0.05.

Panels A–E of Figure  compare
representative
experiments in which we tested the effects of four CFTR potentiators,
VX-770, P1, P2, and Genistein, on the thermal stability of conductance
due to G551D CFTR channels. As summarized in Figure F via comparison of the conductance near the termination of
the thermal pulse with that seen prior to exposure to a potentiator,
all four potentiators protected G551D CFTR channels from thermal deactivation,
albeit to varying extents. It can be seen that, at a predetermined
maximal dose, VX-770 (10 μM) and P2 (10 μM) were the most
potent as protectors, whereas P1 and Genistein (50 μM) was less
so. Also, note that the steady state-activated conductance due to
G551D CFTR channels exhibited substantial variation from oocyte to
oocyte.

VX-770 did not protect ΔF508 CFTR from thermal deactivation.
(A) Following stimulation, an oocyte expressing ΔF508 CFTR channels
was warmed to 37 °C (gray bar and circles) for 10 min. It was
then exposed to 10 μM CF172 after being cooled to 22 °C.
(B) Summary of conductance due to ΔF508 CFTR before and after
a temperature challenge (P &lt; 0.05). (C) Following
stimulation, an oocyte expressing ΔF508 CFTR was exposed to

after being cooled to 22 °C. (D) Summary of VX-770-modified ΔF508

VX-770 stimulated G551D but not ΔF508 CFTR channels at 37
°C. (A) Following activation of conductance via an increase in
intracellular cAMP concentration (see ), an oocyte expressing G551D CFTR was warmed to 37
°C (gray bar and circles). The oocyte was then exposed to 10
μM VX770 and subsequently to 10 μM CF172 at 37 °C.

warmed to 37 °C (gray bar and circles) and then exposed to 10
μM VX770 at 37 °C. (C) Summary of the conductance due to

VX770. The CF172-insensitive conductance was subtracted from the final
analysis. (D) Summary of conductance due to ΔF508 CFTR channels
at 37 °C before and after stimulation by 10 μM VX770.

VX-770 Did Not Protect
ΔF508 CFTR from Thermal Deactivation
Our previous study
produced no evidence that potentiators could
protect ΔF508 CFTR channels from thermal instability. VX-770 was not tested in this earlier study,
however, as the compound was not available to us. Panels A and C of
Figure  show the
results of representative experiments that compared thermal deactivation
of conductance due to ΔF508 channels, with and without prior
exposure to VX-770. Consistent with our previous report, as summarized in panels B and D of Figure , VX-770, like VRT-532, P2, and Genistein, was without
effect on the thermal instability
of ΔF508 CFTR channel function. Recently, Wang et al. reported that ΔF508 CFTR channels exhibited
thermal instability in detached patches that was exacerbated by treatment
with VX-770, an effect not detected in the studies presented here.

Potentiator Efficacy following Thermal Deactivation of CFTR
Channels
The results described above point to an important
difference in the effect of CFTR potentiators like VX-770 on G551D
and ΔF508 CFTR channels that may have a counterpart in the efficacy
of VX-770 in patients carrying these mutations. In a patient’s
first encounter with the drug, however, any G551D CFTR channels would
presumably be partially deactivated, raising the question of the efficacy
of potentiators in channels previously inactivated by exposure to
37 °C. Panels A and B of Figure  show the results of representative experiments
in which we investigated the efficacy of the most potent potentiator,
VX-770, in oocytes expressing G551D CFTR channels when the drug was
applied following the completion of thermal deactivation at 37 °C,
to better mimic the in vivo condition. Exposure to
VX-770 induced a robust increase in the conductance due to G551D channels
at 37 °C (Figure A,C). Because of the
small sample size and the large variance, this robust increase did
not reach statistical significance, although the stimulatory effect
of VX770 was unambiguous in each case. Comparison of the data summarized
in Figure  with that in Figure  suggests that VX-770, when applied at 37 °C, not only
“protected” the G551D CFTR channels but also increased
conductance beyond that seen at 22 °C. Consistent with our previous
report, however, neither VX-770 nor any
of the other potentiators previously tested [P1, P2, and Genistein
(not shown)] produced significant stimulation of ΔF508 channels
when applied at 37 °C (Figure C,D). Figure D summarizes the efficacy of VX-770 in G551D and
ΔF508 CFR channels at 37 °C.

Discussion
The
introduction of a CF therapeutic that directly targets the
CFTR chloride channel was an important validation of the promise of
high-throughput screening and should invigorate the search for a new
generation of compounds that target the more common mutation, ΔF508.
The results presented here have implications for such future drug
discovery efforts. G551D channels, like ΔF508 channels, exhibit
thermal instability. It would seem appropriate, therefore, to add
assays of the thermal stability of channel function to those currently
used to screen chemical libraries for efficacious compounds; that
is, screening should include assays for “protection”
from thermal instability, and compound efficacy should be compared
at 37 °C. Yu et al. reported that,
in membrane patches detached from FRT cells at room temperature, Ivacaftor
(VX-770) was effective in increasing the open probability of a variety
of CFTR channel constructs bearing mutations that adversely affected
channel gating, consistent with a previous report of an increase in
the open probability of ΔF508 CFTR channels under similar conditions. However, in FRT cell layers assayed in Ussing
chambers at 37 °C, the efficacy of Ivacaftor on conductance due
to ΔF508 CFTR channels was minimal, whereas a robust activation
of conductance due to G551D channels was detected, despite a minimal
conductance prior to exposure to Ivacaftor. It seems clear that CFTR potentiators, compounds selected for their
ability to increase CFTR channel open probability, can, among other
things, stabilize the activated state of G551D CFTR channels at 37
°C, an effect that may provide clues about the mode of action
of these compounds and ultimately their binding sites.

Trafficking
and Thermal Stability of Channel Function
The finding that
ΔF508 CFTR channels, rescued by a low temperature
at the surface of Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells, exhibit
thermally induced decreases in open probability raised the question
of whether the thermal instability of ΔF508 CFTR channel function
is directly related to the well-established temperature sensitivity
of ΔF508 CFTR trafficking.− The simplest model, perhaps, would hold that the decrease in open
probability that is evident at 37 °C is a manifestation of the
same temperature-dependent unfolding process that, within the cell,
triggers a quality control mechanism that leads ultimately to the
intracellular degradation of the misfolded protein. Our results, however,
seem to argue against this simple model. Clearly, G551D CFTR channels,
which are trafficked normally or nearly normally, nevertheless exhibit
severe thermal instability of channel function. On the other hand,
the difference between G551D and ΔF508 CFTR could simply be
one of degree. It may be that the G551D CFTR channels, although thermally
unstable, may not proceed as far along the unfolding pathway at 37
°C as do the ΔF508 channels. G551D CFTR channels would,
thereby, escape intracellular degradation but nevertheless fail to
contribute adequately to chloride conductance due to the thermal instability
of channel function that seems likely to reduce channel open probability
at 37 °C.
