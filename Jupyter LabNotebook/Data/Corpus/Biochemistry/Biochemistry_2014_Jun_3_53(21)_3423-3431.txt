Isoprenoids
are essential secondary
metabolites that are assembled from the five-carbon units isopentenyl
pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These building blocks
are the products of one of two biosynthetic pathways that are differentially
distributed throughout various organisms: whereas humans and other
animals utilize the mevalonate pathway, certain species of bacteria,
protozoa, and plants have evolved an independent pathway known as
the non-mevalonate or 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Importantly,
none of the seven enzymes comprising the MEP pathway have homologues
in humans, making them attractive targets
for the development of selective drugs against many human pathogens,
including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum.

The first committed step in the MEP pathway is governed by 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) reductoisomerase (DXR), which catalyzes
a retroaldol–aldol rearrangement of DXP,, followed
by reduction by NADPH to yield MEP (Scheme ). Fosmidomycin is a natural product produced by Streptomyces bacteria that inhibits DXR with Ki values
in the range of 10–8 to 10–7 M.− Although it is effective in the treatment of malaria caused by P. falciparum,, fosmidomycin, its acetyl
analogue, and their phosphonate ester prodrugs are poorly active against M. tuberculosis., Understanding the nature
of interactions between fosmidomycin and DXR for the purposes of designing
improved alternatives is therefore invaluable.

Alignment of DXR sequences from several pathogens revealed
a highly
conserved HPXWXMG motif
that forms a flexible loop that exists in a closed conformation when
fosmidomycin or another dianion (i.e., DXP, sulfate, or phosphite) is bound and
in an open conformation when this ligand is absent (Figure ). Of particular note
in this flexible loop is Trp203 (numbering based on DXR from M. tuberculosis, MtDXR), whose indole ring
is believed to protect the active site from bulk solvent. However, a direct link between this residue
(or the loop as a whole) and catalytic events has yet to be established.
In this work, we have addressed this concern using site-directed mutagenesis
together with steady-state kinetics, pre-steady-state kinetics, and
kinetic isotope effects. Moreover, we evaluated inhibition and binding
thermodynamics between fosmidomycin and Trp203 variants, with unexpected
results that may have implications for inhibitor design.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
All
chemicals were of analytical or reagent
grade and were used without further purification unless otherwise
stated. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, yeast) was purchased
from Calzyme. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was purchased from
Roche. Fructose-1,6-diphosphate (FDP) aldolase (rabbit muscle) was
purchased from Sigma. M. tuberculosis DXR and Escherichia coli DXP synthase were expressed and purified as reported previously,
and their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using
the respective extinction coefficients (ε280 = 37500
M–1 cm–1 for MtDXR, and ε280 = 50310 M–1 cm–1 for DXS) calculated from their amino acid sequence
using the ProtParam utility and verified
by the Bradford assay. Dibenzyl 3-[(benzyloxyamino)propyl]phosphonate
was prepared as described by Ortmann et al. with the following modifications. (1) The reductive amination of
dibenzyl (3-oxopropyl)phosphonate with O-benzylhydroxylamine
hydrochloride and sodium cyanoborohydride was maintained at pH 3 by
dropwise addition of concentrated HCl in the presence of an indicator,
and (2) following the published workup, the product was purified by
flash chromatography with 100% ethyl acetate. Fosmidomycin was prepared
from dibenzyl 3-[(benzyloxyamino)propyl]phosphonate by N-formylation
and hydrogenolysis, as described by Haemers et al.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis

were prepared according
to the protocol of the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent).

forward and reverse directions are listed below, with the mutated
nucleotides underlined: W203G, 5′-GGTGCCCACCCGACTGGGTCCATGG-3′

Synthesis of 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-Phosphate (DXP)
The dicalcium salt of fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP) was used as
starting material, as it was more economical than the alternatives.
To a 20 mL stirred aqueous suspension containing 4.0 g of the dicalcium
salt was added Amberlite IR-120(H+) portionwise until the
suspension cleared. The supernatant was
adjusted to pH 7 with solid K2CO3, resulting
in the formation of a white precipitate. Following centrifugation
at 15000g for 4 min, the supernatant was assayed
for FDP using FDP aldolase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
and this served as the starting material for DXP synthesis, as previously
described. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by a spectrophotometric assay with MtDXR. DXP was converted to the barium salt by the addition of 1 molar
equiv of Ba(OH)2·8H2O, added portionwise
with stirring and pH adjustment with glacial AcOH to maintain a pH
of 7.0–7.5. After centrifugation at 15000g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was concentrated to ∼20
mL by rotary evaporation, resulting in additional precipitate. After
a second round of centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with
3 volumes of EtOH and incubated in a dry ice/EtOH bath for 30–40
min. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 15000g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining
barium salt was desiccated to a constant weight. To a stirred suspension
of the barium salt (1.3 g) in 55 mL of H2O was added 0.5
M HCl dropwise until a clear solution was obtained (pH ∼5.5).
Na2SO4 (0.5 M) was added dropwise until no additional
BaSO4 precipitate was formed. After centrifugation at 15000g for 10 min, the supernatant was decolorized with activated
charcoal [1% (w/v), previously rinsed of impurities with EtOH]. After
the charcoal had been pelleted, the supernatant was passed through
a 0.45 μm syringe filter, and the resulting solution of DXP,
sodium salt was purified on cellulose, as previously described.,

Steady-State Kinetics and Inhibition by Fosmidomycin
The
NADPH stock concentration and initial velocities were determined
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (ε340 = 6.22 mM–1 cm–1). DXP and fosmidomycin stock concentrations were determined by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (120 s delay between transients)
with 5 mM imidazole as an internal standard., In the absence of inhibitor, reactions were initiated at 25 °C
by the addition of 10–66 nM MtDXR to cuvettes
(final volume of 1.0 mL) containing DXP (31–5800 μM),
200 μM NADPH, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10 mM MgCl2. Data were fit with eq  by nonlinear regression
using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Corp.) to determine apparent kcat (left form), kcat/Km (right form), and Kmwhere [E]t is the total enzyme
concentration. For inhibition assays, reactions were initiated at
25 °C by the addition of 10 nM MtDXR to cuvettes
(final volume of 1.0 mL) containing fosmidomycin (0–10 μM),
1 or 2 mM DXP, 200 μM NADPH, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 10
mM MgCl2. Because of the slow onset of inhibition by fosmidomycin,
reaction velocities were measured after a steady state had been attained
(∼1–5 min).

Pre-Steady-State Kinetics
Pre-steady-state
kinetics
were measured with an Applied Photophysics SX-20 stopped-flow spectrophotometer
fit with a 20 μL flow cell (10 mm path length) with a dead time
of 1.08 ms. Transients from four to six repeat drives were averaged
for all stopped-flow assays. The reaction chamber and all reagents
were thermostated at 25.0 °C with a circulating water bath. Both
syringes contained 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, and 200 μM NADPH. One syringe additionally contained DXP
(final concentrations after mixing of 5.0, 7.0, and 10 mM for wild-type MtDXR, W203F, and W203Y, respectively), and the other syringe
additionally contained MtDXR (final concentrations
after mixing of 10, 10, and 20 μM for wild-type MtDXR, W203F, and W203Y, respectively). The NADPH absorbance decay
at 340 nm (ε340 = 6.22 mM–1 cm–1) was monitored for 2 s. The regions of the transients
including the burst and linear steady-state region were fit with eq  by nonlinear regression using Pro-DataViewer (Applied
Photophysics)where ΔA is the amplitude
of the burst, kburst is the apparent first-order
rate constant, and vss is the steady-state
rate, governed by the Michaelis–Menten equation (eq ), following the burst.

Synthesis of (4S)-[4-2H1]NADPH (NADPD)
NADPD
was synthesized on a 0.3 mmol scale
as previously described, with some modifications.
The oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)
(260 mg, 0.316 mmol) was incubated with 130 mg (0.721 mmol) of d-[1-2H]glucose (98 atom % D) in 83 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 40% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in a final
volume of 23 mL. The reaction was initiated with 2.5 mg (50 units,
as determined by the manufacturer) of G6PDH and the mixture incubated
at 30 °C. The progress of the reaction was assessed by monitoring
the A260/A340 ratio. After 100 min, the A260/A340 ratio reached a plateau of ∼3.6,
indicating completion of the reaction. Ice-cold ethanol (270 mL, 12
volumes) was added, and the sample was incubated at −20 °C
for 1 h. A white precipitate was recovered by centrifugation for 15
min at 15000g and 4 °C. After being briefly
air-dried, the pellet was resuspended in 2.0 mL of 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0) and 200 mM NaCl. The crude NADPD product was purified by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a semipreparative
C18 column (Vydac, 5 μm, 22 mm × 250 mm). The C18 column
was pre-equilibrated with 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl at
a flow rate of 8 mL min–1. After the first 8–10
min, NADPD began to elute as indicated by A340. At this point, solvent was switched to 100% methanol, and all fractions
with absorbance at 340 nm were collected and pooled. To promote the
stability of NADPD, the pH of the pooled
fractions was quickly increased via the addition of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH
9.2) to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the resultant solution
was stored overnight at 4 °C without decomposition. After rotary
evaporation to dryness, the material was redissolved in 25 mL of 10
mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) (pH 7.7) and subsequently desalted
in 5 mL portions by reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column (Teledyne/ISCO
RediSep RF high-performance Gold). The column was pre-equilibrated
in 10 mM TEAB buffer, and samples were applied by syringe at a flow
rate not exceeding 30 mL min–1. After the sample
had been washed with an additional 20 mL of TEAB buffer, NADPD was
eluted with 20 mL of 100% methanol. Fractions (1.5 mL) were collected
and assayed for chloride content by being mixed with an aqueous AgNO3 solution. Fractions (elution volume of 16.5–31.5 mL)
containing NADPD (by A340) and no chloride
were pooled and concentrated by rotary evaporation to remove methanol
(confirmed by 1H NMR). The final NADPD solution, displaying
an A260/A340 ratio of ∼3, was frozen and stored at −20 °C.

Primary Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effects
Kinetic isotope
effects on kcat and kcat/Km were determined simultaneously
by global data fitting to eq  using SigmaPlot
(Systat)where V is the maximal velocity, Fi is the fraction of deuterium in NADPH (0 or
1), and EV/K and EV are the
kinetic isotope effects minus 1 on kcat/Km (V/K) and kcat (V), respectively.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
A VP-ITC calorimeter
(GE, formerly MicroCal) equilibrated to 298 K was used for all measurements.
Pilot studies revealed that over the time course of injections (2–3
h), a small amount of MtDXR aggregation had occurred,
leading to a ligand-independent release of heat at later injections
(data not shown). This behavior was avoided by dialysis of the concentrated
protein for 2 h at 298 K against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, and 5% glycerol, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at
13000 rpm to remove insoluble material. For each ITC experiment, the
calorimeter cell was loaded with 10–15 μM MtDXR (monomers), 200 μM NADPH, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM
MgCl2, and 1.7% glycerol. The injection syringe was loaded
with the identical solution except with 50 μM fosmidomycin in
place of the enzyme. After an initial injection of 5 μL, each
injection was 10 μL. Values of ΔH°,
ΔS°, Kassoc, and stoichiometry (n) were determined by fitting
with MicroCal software. Because n was always close
to but less than 1 when all four parameters were allowed to vary,
it was assumed that the active monomer concentration was lower than
that determined by A280; thus, following
the recommended practice,, the monomer concentration
input into the software was decreased until n was
calculated to be 1.00, at which point it was fixed and the other three
parameters were determined again. Values of ΔG° and Kd were calculated using the
thermodynamic relationships ΔG° = −RT ln Kassoc and Kd = 1/Kassoc.

Determination
of the Structure of DXR Trp203 Mutants
The Trp203 mutant
proteins were used for crystallization experiments.
The protein retained the purification tag. Crystals of MtDXR grew under multiple conditions that were screened to identify
the best crystals of each mutant protein. Crystals of W203F were grown
by hanging drop vapor diffusion using a mother liquor containing 30%
PEG 8000, 200 mM NH4OAc, and 50 mM MES (pH 6.5). Crystals
were harvested and cryoprotected using Paratone-N oil and cryocooled
directly in liquid nitrogen. The W203F crystal was used for diffraction
experiments at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline
7-1. The crystal indexed to a tetragonal space group as seen previously
with M. tuberculosis DXR bound to the antibiotic
FR-900098 (PDB entry 4A03). Crystals of W203Y grew via hanging
drop vapor diffusion using a mother liquor containing 6% PEG 4000,
20% MPD, and 50 mM MES (pH 5.5). The W203Y mutant crystal was mounted
in a nylon loop and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen without further
cryoprotection. Diffraction was performed at SSRL beamline 9-2 and
revealed a new orthorhombic space group.

The structure of W203F
was determined by molecular replacement using the protein coordinates
from a low-resolution structure of MtDXR bound to
1-deoxy-l-erythrulose, Mn2+, and NADPH that we had determined by molecular replacement
from the coordinates of PDB entry 4A03. The structure of W203F was determined
using the PHASER module of PHENIX to
identify two protein chains in the asymmetric unit; electron density
for the N-terminal purification tag and residues 1–10, as well
as the final C-terminal residue, was missing, so that the final model
contains residues 11–388 for both chains. The structure of
W203Y was determined by molecular replacement using the protein coordinates
from the W203F structure and four chains identified in the asymmetric
unit. The final model of W203Y contained residues 12–387 for
chain A, 12–389 for chains B and D, and 12–388 for chain
C. Structures of both mutants were refined through manual model building
with COOT and refinement with PHENIX. Diffraction and refinement statistics are presented
in Table .

Results and Discussion
Steady-State
Kinetics
Steady-state kinetics was determined
for four Trp203 mutants of MtDXR (Table ). While alteration to Gly and Ala abolished activity,
the kcat and kcat/Km values of the Phe and Tyr mutants
remained within factors of 3 and 20 of those of the wild type, respectively.
These findings are in agreement with those of Fernandes et al., who mutated the corresponding Trp residue in
the Synechocystis enzyme to Phe, Leu, Val, and Ala
in an attempt to broaden the substrate specificity; all but the Phe
variant were found to be particularly impaired. These data strongly
suggest that DXR requires an aromatic residue in the flexible loop
for effective catalysis.

Pre-Steady-State Kinetics
By monitoring
transient kinetics
under multiple-turnover conditions, one can often obtain kinetic information
not available during steady-state measurements. In previous stopped-flow
studies, when MtDXR was premixed with NADPH and then
rapidly mixed with DXP, a burst in the oxidation of NADPH was observed
during the first turnover. This burst
was attributed to the slow release of MEP (koff) following kchem, the net rate
constant that includes isomerization, reduction, and release of NADP+ (Scheme ). When this was repeated
with W203F, the data appeared to be linear throughout the experiment
(Figure ). With W203Y, a significantly diminished
burst was observed. In this case, fitting of eq  revealed that the burst rate (kburst) relative to wild-type MtDXR had decreased from
49.7 ± 0.5 to 11 ± 2 s–1, and the burst
amplitude (expressed as the mole percentage of protein monomers) had
decreased from 48% to 9.5%. The loss of burst behavior in the two
mutants is indicative of a change in the rate-limiting step in which kchem has become smaller than koff. According to Scheme , kburst is related to kchem and koff by eq  and the burst amplitude is given by eq .Using these equations, kchem and koff were calculated to
be 3.3 ± 0.7 and 7.4 ± 1.3 s–1, respectively,
for W203Y. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme had previously been estimated
to have a kchem of 48.8 ± 1.9 s–1 and a koff of 8.4 ±
0.5 s–1. Thus, pre-steady-state
analysis confirms that mutation of Trp203, at least to Tyr, resulted
in a decrease in the rate of chemistry by 1 order of magnitude while
leaving the rate of MEP release essentially unchanged.

Burst Kinetics
Model for Pre-Steady-State Experiments with MtDXR
Pre-steady-state kinetics. The oxidation
of NADPH was monitored
by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm upon mixing 5, 7, and 10 mM
DXP with wild-type MtDXR (blue, 10 μM), W203F
(red, 10 μM), and W203Y (green, 20 μM), respectively,
in the presence of 200 μM NADPH and 10 mM MgCl2.

Kinetic Isotope Effects
Kinetic isotope effect (KIE)
studies were pursued to confirm the change in the rate-limiting step
upon mutation suggested by the pre-steady-state kinetics. KIEs are
a powerful tool for establishing kinetic mechanisms, as their magnitudes
not only reflect the isotope-sensitive step giving rise to the intrinsic
KIE but also are sensitive to other kinetically significant steps.
In enzyme-catalyzed reactions, primary deuterium KIEs can be measured
on kcat/Km, symbolized D(V/K),
or kcat, symbolized DV. These observed KIEs are related to the intrinsic KIE, Dk, moderated by forward (cf for kcat/Km and cvf for kcat) and reverse (cr) commitment
factors and the equilibrium isotope effect (DKeq) according to eqs  and .Inspection
of these equations reveals that
the difference between D(V/K) and DV lies solely in the respective
forward commitments. As the isotope-sensitive step becomes more rate-limiting,
these commitments decrease and the observed KIE increases toward the
intrinsic value. On the one hand, if D(V/K) and DV are similar
in magnitude, then cf and cvf are similar, and we can conclude that the isotope-sensitive
step is equally rate-limiting on both steady-state parameters. On
the other hand, if one of these KIEs is lower than the other, this
indicates the existence of a slow step unique to that kinetic parameter.

By measuring steady-state kinetics with a varying DXP concentration
and a fixed saturating NADPH or (4S)-[4-2H]NADPH (NADPD) concentration, a D(V/K) of 2.2 ± 0.2 and a DV of 1.35 ± 0.04 were measured for wild-type MtDXR (Table ), in agreement with values reported
by Argyrou and Blanchard using a similar MtDXR construct. Thus, cvf is significantly
greater than cf. When Trp203 was mutated
to Phe or Tyr, the D(V/K) values remained unchanged at 2.4 ± 0.9 and 2.1 ± 0.5,
respectively, but the DV values increased
to 2.1 ± 0.4 and 1.9 ± 0.2, respectively. This indicates cvf was lowered by mutation to become approximately
equal to cf.

To gain insight into
the significance of these forward commitment
factors, it is useful to examine a kinetic mechanism operative under
the conditions of the KIE measurements. Strictly, MtDXR employs a steady-state random mechanism,, but under initial velocity conditions and with the knowledge that
NADPH is a “sticky substrate” (i.e., it tends to react
rather than dissociate from the ternary complex), a simplified steady-state ordered mechanism can be assumed,
as in Scheme  (see the  for a more detailed account of this
mechanism). cf is given by eq  (note that DXP dissociation, k–1, is much faster than isomerization, k2), and cvf is given by eq .For wild-type MtDXR, cvf is larger than cf because of the slow release of MEP, k4 (equivalent to koff in Scheme ), which is consistent with the burst behavior observed
in pre-steady-state kinetics. For the two mutants, the nearly equivalent cf and cvf values
indicate that MEP dissociation is no longer significant (i.e., k2 &lt; k4), consistent
with the loss of burst kinetics, and cvf can be approximated by eq .Further, the fact that cvf is nearly
equal to cf implies
that isomerization from DXP to MEsP is not favored (i.e., k2 &lt; k–2). Therefore, regardless of the DXP concentration, only the isomerization
(k2 and k–2) and reduction (k3) steps contribute
to the rate upon mutation of Trp203. This finding establishes a functional
link between the flexible loop and chemical barrier crossing.

Inhibition by Fosmidomycin
Despite extensive medicinal
chemistry efforts, few compounds have been identified with activity
rivaling fosmidomycin. Accordingly, it often serves as a reference
compound for benchmarking DXR inhibition. While fosmidomycin inhibited
wild-type MtDXR with a Ki of 93 ± 10 nM, it surprisingly exhibited more potent inhibition
of W203F (60 ± 20 nM) and W203Y (14 ± 2 nM) (Table ). Considering that each variant has a unique Km for DXP, the Km/Ki ratio provides a more realistic description
of the relative specificity of each for fosmidomycin over the substrate;
thus, as tryptophan is changed to phenylalanine or tyrosine, the Km/Ki increases from
1500 to 18000 or 28000, respectively (Table ).

Thermodynamics of Fosmidomycin Binding
The reason for
the enhanced preference for binding of fosmidomycin to the Trp203
mutants was not immediately apparent; therefore, isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) was performed in an attempt to dissect the binding
energy into enthalpic and entropic components. Previous ITC studies
with MtDXR have been reported at 279 K because its
protein stability is better at lower temperatures. Consistent with this observation, the preparations of Trp203
mutants displayed some precipitation over prolonged incubations at
298 K, which was used in our kinetic and inhibition studies. Because
we desired to maintain this temperature for all experiments, 1.7%
glycerol was included in the calorimeter cell and syringe, which successfully
stabilized the proteins throughout the titrations without interfering
with the binding thermodynamics. Fosmidomycin was titrated against
each enzyme in the presence of 200 μM NADPH and 10 mM MgCl2 at pH 7.5 and 298 K (Figure ). The
dissociation constant in each case was ∼2-fold lower than the
respective inhibition constant but followed the same order: wild type
&gt; W203F &gt; W203Y (Table ). The Kd of 59 ± 5 nM for wild-type MtDXR
is lower than the value of 290 nM reported at 279 K with 2 mM MnCl2. The reason for the discrepancy
is not apparent, as lower temperatures are expected to yield tighter
affinity for exothermic binding, and the nature of the metal (i.e.,
Mg2+ vs Mn2+) was shown not to be significant
for binding of fosmidomycin to E. coli DXR. The free energy of binding to wild-type MtDXR was found to be evenly distributed between enthalpy
and entropy (Table ). Strikingly, when Trp203
was mutated, the binding enthalpy became more exothermic by 2.8 kcal/mol
(W203F) and 5.4 kcal/mol (W203Y), exceeding the reduction in entropy
of 2.5 kcal/mol (W203F) and 4.0 kcal/mol (W203Y), respectively. Thus,
mutation of this residue to Phe and Tyr resulted in 75% and 91% enthalpy-driven
binding of fosmidomycin, respectively.

The origin of the elevated binding
enthalpy when altering Trp203
is not immediately clear. The major exothermic contributions to binding
are noncovalent interactions formed in the enzyme–inhibitor
complex, while the major endothermic contributions are hydrogen bonds
in the unliganded enzyme between the protein and bound water molecules,
which must be displaced to accommodate the inhibitor. When binding
becomes more exothermic, as in the case of the Trp203 mutants, one
of three situations is most likely involved: (1) the bound complex
experiencing a net increase in the strength of noncovalent interactions,
(2) the unliganded protein being less hydrated, or (3) a combination
of both. On one hand, when considering only noncovalent interactions,
the hydrophobicity of residue 203 cannot be the major determinant
because changes to more hydrophobic (i.e., Phe) and less hydrophobic
(i.e., Tyr) side chains both resulted in more exothermic binding.
Alternatively, the binding enthalpy may be influenced by differences
in hydrogen bonding to this residue in the enzyme–inhibitor
complex (vide infra). On the other hand, when considering
the unliganded enzymes and in the absence of large changes in protein
conformation that would be unexpected for this point mutation, W203Y
would be assumed to be the most hydrated because of phenol’s
polarity and potential for forming hydrogen bonds; this would have
resulted in less exothermic binding, which was not observed.

Structural
Investigation of MtDXR Trp203 Variants
To
address the surprising differences in the enthalpy of binding
of fosmidomycin to the Trp203 variants, the crystal structures of
W203F and W203Y in the presence of Mn2+, fosmidomycin,
and NADPH were determined using diffraction data to 2.3 and 1.8 Å,
respectively. The active sites of all protein chains in W203F and
W203Y showed electron density for all three ligands. This result differs
from the published structure of wild-type MtDXR (PDB
entry 4AIC),
which showed only one of the two subunits was occupied by fosmidomycin
(Figure A), but is similar to the structure
bound with the analogous inhibitor FR-900098 (the acetyl derivative
of fosmidomycin), which features fully occupied active sites (PDB
entry 4A03). Comparison of the structural deviation between
any pairs of chains between the mutant and closed wild-type structures
gave a root-mean-square displacement of &lt;0.4 Å between all
Cα atoms, demonstrating that there are no large conformational
changes to the structures. The aromatic side chains of the wild-type
and mutant enzymes all adopt the same torsional angles and fill a
hydrophobic pocket formed by Pro265 and Met267. The additional residues
within 4 Å of the Trp203 side chain of wild-type MtDXR, Ser245 and His248, are unchanged in the mutants.

In the
three fosmidomycin-bound MtDXR structures, the inhibitor’s
phosphonate moiety not only makes contacts with active-site residues
(Ser213, Asn218, Ser177, and Lys219) but also forms a hydrogen bond
with one of three water molecules that form a hydrogen bond network
to His248 (Figure ), a residue that is critical
for DXP binding and turnover. Although
the positions of these water molecules are essentially unchanged among
the variants, residue 203 appears to impinge upon this water network.
In particular, the indole nitrogen of Trp203 is 3.3 Å from the
water molecule (W1) that interacts directly with the phosphonate group,
and therefore, Trp203 may serve as a hydrogen bond donor. Whereas
W203F lacks the ability to hydrogen bond, the phenolic oxygen of Tyr203
in W203Y makes a 2.6 Å hydrogen bond to the third water molecule
(W3) in the network. On the basis of the observed enthalpy differences,
one may speculate that residue 203 attenuates the strength of the
water network. Accordingly, using W203F as a reference point, the
Trp–W1 hydrogen bond in wild-type MtDXR disrupts
the water network and therefore moderately destabilizes the complex.
In contrast, the Tyr–W3 hydrogen bond may reinforce the water
network, significantly stabilizing its complex.

Active-site structures
of (A) wild-type MtDXR
(PDB entry 4AIC), (B) W203F, and (C) W203Y in complex with fosmidomycin, NADPH,
and Mn2+. Possible hydrogen bonds (yellow dashed lines)
are shown connecting His248, three water molecules (W1–W3),
the inhibitor’s phosphonate group, and Trp203 or Tyr203.

It is important to note that we
cannot exclude differences in hydration
of the unliganded complexes as a contributor to the increased binding
enthalpy exhibited by W203F and W203Y relative to that of wild-type MtDXR (vide supra). Greater hydration of
the unliganded wild-type enzyme could result from the surface area
of the indole group being larger than those of benzene and phenol,
requiring more ordered water molecules in its vicinity. Alternatively,
this could be the result of structural differences among the variants
in their unbound states. Attempts to crystallize the proteins in the
absence of fosmidomycin were unsuccessful, so a structural basis for
evaluating this possibility cannot be found. Nevertheless, in light
of the low root-mean-square displacements observed for the backbones
of the enzyme–inhibitor complexes, we expect the unbound complexes
to be similarly superimposable and thus similarly hydrated.

Conclusions
and Implications for Inhibitor Design
On the basis of structural
data, several groups have considered
DXR’s conserved flexible loop an essential catalytic element.,,− By demonstrating
a change in the rate-limiting step upon alteration of Trp203 in this
loop, we have established a functional link between this structural
element and chemical barrier crossing. The inhibition and binding
studies with fosmidomycin reinforce the importance of the loop as
a determinant in ligand association. Most importantly, the results
of the calorimetry study suggest a significant amount of untapped
binding energy might be exploited through formation of new interactions
between an inhibitor and the loop, either directly or via the active-site
water network. Thus, rather than realizing this binding potential
through alteration of the protein, as described in this work, we envision
construction of fosmidomycin derivatives with polar moieties extending
from its propyl backbone. Although DXR’s active site is intolerant
to many substitutions to the fosmidomycin core, substituents at the
position α to the phosphonate have been well accommodated.,
