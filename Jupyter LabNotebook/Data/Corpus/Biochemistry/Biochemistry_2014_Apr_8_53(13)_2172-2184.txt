Alternative
splicing of the
human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) genome is a highly regulated
process that involves site-specific recruitment of host factors to
viral RNA control elements., The splicing pattern
is complex, as more than 40 spliced isoforms are produced from a single
9.7 kb genome. Recent deep sequencing
data using a clinical isolate show the HIV-1 transcript pool may include
upward of 100 different spliced products that vary with time, cell
type, and infected individual. Along with
unspliced genomic RNA, the pool encompasses two major classes of spliced
transcripts, a 1.8 kb class and a 4 kb class, which derive from the
combinatorial usage of five 5′ donor and eight 3′ acceptor
sites. The 1.8 kb transcripts are completely spliced and encode viral
proteins Tat, Rev, and Nef, whereas the 4 kb class consists of singly
spliced transcripts that encode Env, Vpu, Vif, and Vpr. Efforts to
understand the splicing mechanism in HIV-1 have revealed all of the
3′ acceptor sites are suboptimal, primarily because of nonconsensus
polypyrimidine tracts and branch points., A proper balance
of spliced transcripts is maintained through the use of cis regulatory signals functioning as silencers or enhancers., The cis signals, collectively termed splicing regulatory
elements (SREs), are binding sites for members of the mutually antagonistic
SR and hnRNP protein families. Generally, SR proteins bind enhancer
elements to activate suboptimal splice sites, whereas hnRNP proteins
counteract this activity through interactions with silencer elements., Despite extensive research that has aimed to understand the HIV-1
splicing mechanism, the series of molecular events that determine
whether a 3′ splice site will be activated or repressed remains
largely unknown.

Among the 3′ acceptor sites, regulation
at splice site A7
(ssA7) has been the most thoroughly studied.− Splicing of site D4 to A7 is required to remove the env intron containing the Rev responsive element (RRE) and produce the
1.8 kb multiply spliced (Rev-independent) transcripts. An intronic
splicing silencer (ISS), a bipartite exonic splicing silencer (ESS3a/b),
and two exonic splicing enhancers (ESE2 and ESE3) constitute the core
SREs that control the activity of ssA7., RNA secondary
structure probing revealed the ISS, ESE, and ESS3b elements are located
in the apical portion of three stem loop domains:, SL1ISS, SL2ESE, and SL3ESS3. These sites
were additionally shown to bind the host hnRNP A1 (SL1ISS, SL3ESS3, and SL2ESE3) and ASF/SF2 (SL2ESE3) proteins to repress or activate ssA7 usage.−, Two mutually incompatible models
have been proposed to explain the regulation of ssA7.,,, The model suggested by Krainer et al. asserts hnRNP A1 initially
binds a high-affinity UAG element on ESS3b, followed by cooperative
assembly in a 3′–5′ direction along weaker sites. Cooperative binding of multiple hnRNP A1 molecules
is sufficient to unwind the RNA secondary structure and displace an
SR protein bound to its cognate ESE element upstream from ESS3b., The Kjems and Branlant groups independently proposed an alternative
model for ssA7 regulation., Their model posits hnRNP
A1 cooperatively assembles on the ssA7 SRE locus within the context
of a conserved RNA secondary structure to effectively occlude ASF/SF2
recognition of the ESE elements. Footprinting studies of multiple
hnRNP A1 proteins bound to the ssA7 locus showed discrete protection
patterns, inconsistent with binding-induced unwinding of the RNA secondary
structure. Given the discrepancies between the two models, it is obvious
that a better understanding of the RNA binding properties of hnRNP
A1 is needed.

Human hnRNP A1 is an ∼36 kDa protein composed
of tandem
N-terminal RNA recognition motifs, collectively known as UP1, and
a C-terminal glycine-rich domain. The
UP1 domain confers nucleic acid binding specificity, whereas the glycine-rich
domain facilitates protein–protein contacts and interacts with
nucleic acids nonspecifically.− The binding properties of hnRNP A1 have been studied to a greater
extent with nucleic acid substrates that contain a low degree of structural
complexity, as compared to substrates that adopt defined secondary
structures. These studies have revealed hnRNP A1 interacts with nucleic
acids over a wide affinity range, preferentially binds single-stranded
nucleic acids, and has a higher specificity for purines than for pyrimidines.−,, Moreover, in vitro selection experiments showed
hnRNP A1 binds a 5′-UAGGGA/U-3′ consensus sequence with
nanomolar affinity.

Structural
insights into the determinants of sequence-specific
binding have been provided through the crystal structure of UP1 bound
to single-stranded telomeric DNA, which contains two copies of a high-affintiy
TAGG motif. In the crystal, UP1 forms a dimer in which the relative
intra-RRM orientation is antiparallel. This arrangement positions RRM1 from one monomer in contact with
RRM2 from the symmetry-related monomer, therefore creating an extended
nucleic acid binding platform. In the crystal structure, the single-stranded
telomeric DNA stretches in a 5′–3′ direction
from RRM1 of one monomer to RRM2 of the other monomer. The extended
binding platform observed in the UP1 dimer has been used to explain
the high-affinity binding properties of target nucleic acid sequences
as well as hnRNP A1 functional mechanisms. While the UP1–DNA structure offers a wealth of insight into
principles of sequence-specific recognition, the structure does not
explain how hnRNP A1 recognizes complex RNA secondary structures as
observed for the ssA7 SRE locus.

Our previously determined solution
NMR structure of SL3ESS3 revealed the ESS3b element (5′-GAUUAG-3′)
adopts a
quasi-symmetric heptaloop that we reasoned forms a binding surface
for hnRNP A1. Using titration calorimetry,
we determined both RRM domains of UP1 are required to form a 1:1 high-affinity
complex with SL3ESS3 in which binding does not disrupt
the RNA secondary structure. Here, we
have further characterized the binding properties of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex by conducting a systematic mutational and biophysical
study. Key findings of this work reveal the SL3ESS3 secondary
structure is highly conserved across several HIV-1 subtypes and is
an important determinant in forming a high-affinity UP1–SL3ESS3 complex and binding involves multiple contact points primarily
with purine bases of the ESS3b loop. Moreover, the data presented
here shed light on how UP1 interacts with stable stem loop structures.

Materials
and Methods
Phylogenetic Analysis of ESS3 Elements
Nucleotide sequences
(excluding recombinants) comprising the ESS3b stem loop region (NL4-3
coordinates) were derived from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database
(http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/mainpage.html) for HIV-1 group M subtypes (12 total) for which at least 10 sequences
had been submitted. Sequences for individual subtypes were aligned
in Geneious (version 6.1.7) using the ClustalW multiple-sequence alignment
algorithm. Consensus sequences and logos
for individual subtypes were generated also using Geneious (version
6.1.7) based on the majority nucleotide present at each site. Regions
of conservation for each subtype were defined on the basis of a threshold
frequency (represented as the height of the logo) of 75% within the
consensus logo for the corresponding aligned sequences, and nucleotides
most representative of these conserved sites were used for subtype-specific
secondary structure predictions. A global consensus sequence and logo
were also determined using an alignment of the consensus sequences
for each subtype using the same method in Geneious.

Likelihood
mapping implemented in Tree Puzzle (version 5.2) was used to determine if sufficient phylogenetic signal
was present for the group M consensus sequence alignment prior to
tree reconstruction. This alignment was then used to infer a maximum
likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree (Figure ) and to calculate the overall mean genetic distance in Mega (version
5.2). The tree was outgroup-rooted using
the consensus sequence for HIV-1 group O sequences also acquired from
the Los Alamos HIV database. The Kimura two-parameter model with invariant
sites was chosen for both the tree reconstruction
and distance calculations based on the likelihood ratio test of log
likelihood values provided using the nucleotide model test also implemented
in Mega. A series of 2000 bootstrap replicates was performed in addition
to a partition analysis in Phylopart (version 2.0) based on a percentile distance threshold of 9% and bootstrap
support of ≥80%.

Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree inferred
from HIV-1 group
M subtype-specific consensus sequences. The Kimura two-parameter model
with invariant sites was used for ML tree reconstruction and calculation
of the mean genetic distance. The HIV-1 group O consensus sequence
was used for outgroup rooting of the tree. Asterisks denote bootstrap
support of ≥80% for 2000 replicates. Branch lengths are presented
in substitutions per site (sub/site) and scaled according to the scale
bar depicted at the bottom. The overall mean genetic distance was
0.165 ± 0.041 sub/site.

In Vitro Transcription of SL3ESS3 Constructs
SL3ESS3 and the cytosine-substituted
constructs were transcribed in vitro using recombinant
T7 RNA polymerase expressed from BL21(DE3) cells. Synthetic DNA templates
were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and
correspond to the NL4-3 HIV-1 subtype. Transcription reactions were
conducted using standard procedures, in reaction
volumes ranging from 10 to 30 mL and mixtures subsequently purified
via urea–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroelution
and washed multiple times in a Millipore Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal
filter device. The RNA was then dried in a Vacufuge Plus (Eppendorf)
and resuspended in a buffer consisting of 120 mM KCl, 10 mM K2HPO4, and 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 6.5). NMR samples were
dried down in buffer and resuspended in a 90% H2O/10% D2O mixture. Prior to being used, each RNA was heated to 95
°C for 2 min and snap-cooled on ice to ensure a single hairpin
conformation, as determined by nondenaturing PAGE. The six-nucleotide
ESS3b loop construct was purchased from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon
RNAi Technologies and deprotected following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Concentrations were determined using theoretical molar extinction
coefficients calculated with NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher).

UP1 Expression
and Purification
The N-terminal (His)6-UP1 fusion
(used for ITC and size exclusion chromatography)
was prepared as previously described. For NMR studies, a C-terminal UP1-(His)6 fusion was used
because it gave better resolved 1H–15N HSQC spectra. We previously showed UP1 binds SL3ESS3 with identical thermodynamics despite the location of the (His)6 tag. Briefly, UP1-(His)6 was transformed into BL21DE3 cells and grown in M9 medium
supplemented with either 1 g/L 15NH4Cl for HSQC
titrations or 1 g/L 15NH4Cl and 2 g/L [13C]glucose for backbone assignments. The labeled UP1-(His)6 constructs were purified via nickel affinity chromatography
using a 1 mL Hi-trap column (GE Biosciences) followed by further purification
and buffer exchange using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg (GE Biosciences)
gel filtration column. The purity was evaluated via sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS)–PAGE, and the concentration was determined using
a theoretical molar extinction coefficient. Protein stock solutions
were kept in a buffer consisting of 120 mM KCl, 10 mM K2HPO4 (pH 6.5), and 0.5 mM EDTA at 4 °C until they
were used.

Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatographic
Titrations
Chromatographic titrations were performed with
a Superdex 200 10/300
GL column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). Each RNA was heated to 95
°C for 2 min and snap-cooled on ice to ensure a single hairpin
conformation. Samples in 120 mM KCl, 10 mM K2HPO4, and 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 6.5) were loaded into a 100 μL loop and
run at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. Samples were run at 5 μM RNA,
and complexes were prepared by increasing the level of UP1 to give
molar ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, and 1.5:1.

Calorimetric Titrations
Titrations were performed at
25 °C using a VP-ITC calorimeter (MicroCal, LLC). The N-terminal
(His)6-UP1 construct was used for all titrations. To avoid
adding reducing agent to the ITC cell, two Cys-to-Ser point mutations
were introduced at positions 43 and 175. The Cys-to-Ser mutant gave
identical HSQC spectra, confirming the protein behaves like the wild
type. The RNA constructs were prepared by being dried down in water
utilizing a Vacufuge Plus (Eppendorf) and resuspended in 120 mM KCl,
10 mM K2HPO4, and 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 6.5). The
samples were diluted to concentrations of 2.5–3 μM for
the wild type and cytosine-substituted SL3ESS3 constructs.
The ESS3b loop construct was prepared at a concentration of 20 μM.
Prior to titrations, the samples were annealed by being heated at
95 °C for 2 min and snap-cooled on ice. UP1 was prepared at a
concentration of 335 μM for ESS3b loop titrations and 50 μM
for SL3ESS3 titrations. UP1 was titrated into ∼1.4
mL of RNA over 35 injections of 8 μL each. Each titration was
performed in three replicates. Prior to nonlinear least-squares fitting
in Origin version 7.0, the raw data were corrected for dilution by
subtracting the average heats from the last few points of the saturated
upper asymptotes.

NMR Spectroscopy
RNA secondary structures
were confirmed
with one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR of the imino region on
a Varian 600 MHz instrument equipped with an HCN room-temperature
Bioprobe. Spectra were recorded at 283 K using the Wet pulse sequence
with 256 scans at a spectral width of 15000 Hz. Sample concentrations
of 300 μM were prepared for SL3ESS3 and the cytosine-substituted
constructs. The ESS3b loop was prepared at a concentration of 50 μM.
Each sample was annealed and snap-cooled prior to collection.

1H–15N HSQC titrations were performed
on a Bruker 900 MHz spectrophotomer (TXI cryoprobe) with the HSQCETFPF3GPSI
pulse sequence at 298 K. Titrations of unlabeled SL3ESS3 into 15N-labeled UP1-(His)6 were performed
at molar ratios from 0.25 to 1.0 in 120 mM KCl, 10 mM K2HPO4, and 0.5 mM EDTA (pH 6.5) in a 90% H2O/10%
D2O mixture. 1H–15N HSQC chemical
shift assignments for free UP1 were taken from the BMRB (18728) and further confirmed for our construct by running
the standard suite of triple-resonance NMR experiments: HNCACB, HNCO,
and C(CO)NH. All spectra were recorded at 298 K. All NMR data were
processed with NMRPipe/NMRDraw and analyzed
using NMRView J.

Saturation Transfer Difference
NMR
NMR-STD experiments
were conducted at 5 μM UP1 and 100 μM SL3ESS3 for fully protonated RNA and 10 μM UP1 and 200 μM SL3ESS3 for 2H(GC)-labeled SL3ESS3. All
samples were prepared in buffer consisting of 120 mM KCl, 10 mM K2HPO4 (pH 6.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 99% 2H2O. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker 800 MHz
spectrometer at 298 K running a modified version of the zgf2pr pulse
sequence. The on-resonance frequency was set to 1.15 ppm with an irradiation
time of 1.25 s and a power level of 60 dB.

Results
Evidence of
Phylogenetic Conservation of the ESS3 Stem Loop
Structure
To determine the level of conservation of the ESS3
stem loop structure (SL3ESS3), we performed alignments
of HIV-1 subtypes derived from group M for which there are at least
10 sequences in the Los Alamos HIV database. The mean number of HIV-1
ESS3 sequences analyzed is 2860, with the total number of sequences
per subtype provided in Table S1 of the . Maximum likelihood analysis for group M subtype-specific
consensus sequences revealed a relatively large amount of nucleotide
diversity for the ESS3b stem loop region with a mean genetic distance
of 0.165 ± 0.041 substitute per site and a low frequency of statistical
support for individual clusters (Figure ).
However, as shown in Figure , phylogenetic
conservation is observed for particular regions within the sequence
for all subtypes analyzed. The most conserved features occur in three
subregions: the ESS3b element, a five-nucleotide stretch upstream
of ESS3b, and a five-nucleotide stretch downstream of ESS3b. Secondary
structure predictions using the most frequently occurring nucleotides
of the consensus logos reveal the five-nucleotide stretch regions
form stable base pairs in all strains, which universally exposes the
ESS3b element at the apex of stem loop structures (Figure S1 of the ). Although not predicted,
the subtype-specific secondary structures might potentially form noncanonical
pairs within the adjacent loop regions. Given the moderate conservation
observed for the individual subtypes, a global consensus sequence
and logo were determined from subtype-specific alignments (Figure B). The consensus sequence determined here for the
ESS3 stem loop structure is 5′-GAUCCRUKCGAUUAGUGARCGGAUU-3′,
where R corresponds to A or G and K corresponds to G or U. As expected,
the global consensus sequence shows a high level of conservation of
compensatory base pairing proximal to ESS3b with secondary structure
predictions further supporting a conserved stem loop structure (Figure C). The consensus secondary structure consists of
a 5 bp lower helix, a 4 bp upper helix, and a five-nucleotide single-stranded
ESS3b loop. Using the ESS3 stem loop structure derived from NL4-3,
we previously showed the predicted GU base pair adjacent to the ESS3b
loop does not form, which increases the loop size to seven nucleotides. Furthermore, the AC juxtaposition that separates
the lower and upper helices forms a pH-dependent AH+C base
pair in NL4-3 that enhances the thermodynamic stability of the stem
loop structure by ∼1.5 kcal/mol. The phylogenetic results presented here are consistent with previously
published work using a much smaller data set., The
ability to form a stable stem loop structure that exposes the ESS3b
silencer element is a phylogenetically conserved structural motif
in group M viruses.

using the NL4-3 numbering system. As depicted, the alignments show
three subregions with a high level of sequence conservation: the ESS3b
loop, a five-nucleotide stretch upstream of ESS3b, and a five-nucleotide
stretch downstream of ESS3b. (B) Global consensus logo of the ESS3
stem loop structure derived from subtype-specific alignments. (C)

the ESS3b silencer.

The ESS3 Stem Loop Structure
Is Required To Form a High-Affinity
UP1–SL3ESS3 Complex
The phylogenetic conservation
of the ESS3 stem loop structure suggests RNA structure may contribute
to its silencer activity. Early biochemical mapping studies with hnRNP
A1 yield mixed results regarding the integrity of the stem loop structure
within the protein–RNA silencer complex, however.,,, Using CD spectroscopy and the UP1 domain of hnRNP A1, we previously
showed the ESS3 stem loop structure remains intact within the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex. Moreover, calorimetric
titrations revealed UP1 binds SL3ESS3 as a high-affinity
(Kd = 37.8 ± 1.1 nM) 1:1 complex,
where the binding profile is characterized by a large favorable change
in enthalpy (ΔH° = −38.8 ±
2.1 kcal/mol) and opposed by an unfavorable change in entropy (−TΔS° = 28.7 ± 2.1 kcal/mol).
Repeat calorimetric titrations of the complex performed here under
slightly different buffer conditions [140 mM K+ (pH 6.5)]
are in excellent agreement with previously published results (Table ), further validating the thermodynamic signature
of this interaction.

Each construct
is defined by
its mutation in the loop, which is represented in bold in the 5′

sequence. The data were collected at 298 K, 140 mM K+,
and pH 6.5. The thermodynamic parameters were derived from fits to
a single-site binding isotherm (three replicates).

F represents the
factor by which the Kd of the mutant SL3ESS3 construct changes relative to that of the wild type.

Standard errors for stoichiometries
were less than 5%.

To assess
whether the ESS3 sequence alone is sufficient for high-affinity
UP1 binding, we conducted calorimetric titrations using a six-nucleotide
oligomer that mimics the ESS3b loop sequence. Isolated ESS3b does
not contain any detectable secondary structure as determined by 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy (not shown); therefore, thermodynamic measurements
using this construct report primarily on sequence determinants of
binding. As shown in Figure , UP1 binds the
ESS3b loop very weakly (Kd = 4.2 ±
0.4 μM) and with a thermodynamic signature markedly different
from that of the UP1–SL3ESS3 interaction (Table ). The UP1–ESS3b loop complex shows large
reductions in free energy (ΔΔG°
= 3.0 kcal/mol) and enthalpy (ΔΔH°
= 29.4 kcal/mol) relative to those of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex. By contrast, the loss of entropy upon formation of the
UP1–ESS3b complex is smaller compared to that observed for
the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex (Table ). Collectively, the thermodynamic results provide clear evidence
that UP1 recognizes the ESS3 stem loop structure using a fundamentally
different set of interactions compared to how it recognizes the single-stranded
isolated ESS3b oligomer.

determinant. (A)

to a single-site isotherm. Changes in binding affinity are illustrated
by the slope of the curve, with a lower slope indicating weaker binding.
The comparison of the ESS3b loop oligomer (5′-GAUUAG-3′)
to SL3ESS3 demonstrates the importance of structured elements
in the interaction. Calorimetric titrations were performed at 298
K in pH 6.5 phosphate buffer containing 140 mM K+.

Single-Cytosine Substitutions
Reveal the Importance of Conserved
ESS3b Nucleotides in Stabilizing the UP1–SL3ESS3 Interaction
Having established the importance of secondary
structure in the UP1–SLess3 interaction, we sought
to determine the energetic contribution of each ESS3b nucleotide position
within the context of the folded RNA. Stoltzfus et al. previously
reported the ESS3b loop sequence is conserved across different HIV-1
group M clades, with a determined 5′-G(Y/A)UAG-3′ consensus
motif. Their results are consistent with
the alignments performed here. The ESS3b consensus motif resembles
the high-affinity hnRNP A1 winner sequence identified by in
vitro selection experiments; however, only a single UAG copy
is present in ESS3b, whereas two copies are present in the winner
sequence. To assess the energetic contribution
of the ESS3b motif to high-affinity UP1 binding, we prepared a series
of SL3ESS3 constructs in which each position of the 5′-GAUUAG-3′
apical loop was mutated to a cytosine residue. Fluorescence competition
assays have demonstrated hnRNP A1 to have lower binding affinities
with pyrimidines, particularly cytosine. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra recorded for the mutant
constructs show the cytosine substitutions do not affect the global
secondary structure of SL3ESS3 as diagnostic imino signals
of base-paired regions were observed (Figure S2 of the ). An additional imino
signal appeared in the spectrum recorded for the G8454C construct,
however. On the basis of the chemical shift (∼11.9 ppm) of
the additional signal, we predict G8454C forms a new Watson–Crick
base pair with G8459.

As a preliminary measure of the binding
properties, we monitored stepwise titrations of UP1 with the SL3ESS3 constructs (wild-type and mutant) via analytical size
exclusion chromatography. Chromatographic traces of each titration
are shown in Figure . Consistent with our
previous solution NMR studies, free SL3ESS3 elutes from
the column as a symmetric peak indicative of a stably folded structure
(Figure ). Upon titration of UP1 to a 0.5:1
molar ratio, the elution profile shows two peaks, of roughly equal A280 intensities, consistent with free and UP1-bound
SL3ESS3 species. At a 1:1 molar ratio, the A280 intensity of the free peak is reduced to &lt;20% of
its starting A280 intensity, whereas a
completely resolved symmetrical peak is observed for the complex.
Further increasing the molar ratio to 1.5:1 leads to a complete loss
of the free SL3ESS3 peak with no evidence of additional
higher-order complexes (Figure ). These data
are in excellent agreement with the 1:1 stoichiometry observed by
titration calorimetry (Figure ) and validate
the method as a qualitative tool for assessing UP1–RNA binding
properties.

Cytosine substitutions of conserved ESS3b loop nucleobases affect
the stability of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex. Analytical
size exclusion chromatographic titrations of UP1 into wild-type and
cytosine-substituted SL3ESS3 constructs. Titrations were
performed by incubating a fixed amount (5 μM) of RNA with increasing
amounts of UP1 until a final molar ratio of 1:1 was reached. Each
complex was resolved at 277 K on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). Vertical dashed and solid lines correspond
to free and UP1-bound SL3ESS3, respectively. The variation
in the amount of free RNA remaining at a 1:1 molar ratio is indicative
of differences in UP1–SL3ESS3 binding affinity.

As shown in Figure , the chromatographic
traces of the mutant titrations show UP1 binds the SL3ESS3 cytosine-substituted constructs with similar 1:1 stoichiometries.
For each titration event, a well-resolved complex peak is observed.
The traces offer insight into the relative binding affinities as clear
differences in the amount of complex formed across the titrations
are observed. Notably, the data show the G8454C, A8458C, and G8459C
constructs bind UP1 with affinities lower than that of wild-type SL3ESS3 because a significant peak for free RNA is observed at
a 1:1 molar ratio (Figure ). By comparison,
both U-to-C substitutions exhibit a titration profile very similar
to that of the wild-type construct. Taken together, these qualitative
results reveal U-to-C substitutions have only minor effects on complex
stability, whereas G/A-to-C substitutions measurably destabilize the
complex.

A more quantitative description of the ESS3b nucleotides
involved
in high-affinity UP1 binding is provided via calorimetric titrations
with the SL3ESS3 cytosine-substituted constructs (Figure ). In agreement with the chromatographic titrations,
the calorimetry results show the U8456C and U8457C constructs have
thermodynamic signatures similar to those of wild-type SL3ESS3 (Table ). Indeed, U8456C binds UP1 with
an identical affinity, whereas U8457C shows an ∼3-fold reduction.
For both constructs, a large favorable change in enthalpy is the thermodynamic
driving force of complex formation. By comparison, the G/A-to-C constructs
show binding affinities reduced from 3- to 11-fold (Table ). These results are generally consistent with the
qualitative binding properties measured by size exclusion chromatography
(Figure ). Relative to wild-type SL3ESS3, the A8455C construct showed the smallest perturbation in binding
free energy (ΔΔG° = 0.6 kcal/mol),
whereas perturbations for G8454C (ΔΔG° = 1.0 kcal/mol) and G8459C (ΔΔG° = 0.9 kcal/mol) were larger and approximately equal in magnitude.
Notably, the 8458C construct displayed the largest reduction in binding
free energy (ΔΔG° = 1.4 kcal/mol,
corresponding to an ∼10-fold decrease in Kd) and enthalpy (ΔΔH°
= 19.5 kcal/mol) relative to those of wild-type SL3ESS3. The collective thermodynamic data clearly show UP1 discriminates
less against U-to-C substitutions than against G/A-to-C substitutions
within the context of SL3ESS3. Moreover, the data reveal
the high-affinity nature of the UP1–SL3ESS3 interaction
derives from more than a single-site interaction because the construct
with the weakest affinity (A8458C) still binds with a Kd in the high nanomolar range and approximately 13-fold
tighter than the ESS3b loop.

Calorimetric titrations reveal the energetic
contribution of ESS3b
nucleobases to the stability of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex.
Representative isotherms of UP1 titrated into each respective cytosine-substituted
SL3ESS3 construct are illustrated. Differences in binding
affinities are reflected by the slope of the curve, with a smaller
slope indicative of weaker binding. Titrations were performed at 298
K, 140 mM K+, and pH 6.5. Processed isotherms fitted with
a nonlinear 1:1 binding isotherm are shown. Average values and standard
deviations of the dissociation constants (three replicates) are provided.

Double-Cytosine Substitutions
Reveal UP1 Interacts with Multiple
Purine Nucleobases of the ESS3b Loop
The UP1 titrations with
single-cytosine-substituted SL3ESS3 constructs revealed
a specific preference for G and A residues in the apical ESS3b loop.
Therefore, we decided to probe for thermodynamic synergy between pairs
of ESS3b residues by measuring binding affinities using double-cytosine-substituted
SL3ESS3 constructs. For these studies, three constructs
were prepared: G8454C/G8459C, A8455C/A8458C, and U8456C/U8457C. The
rationale behind the design of the constructs derives from the approximate
sequence symmetry of the ESS3b loop sequence, 5′-GAU⊙UAGU-3′
(where ⊙ represents the axis of mirror symmetry), and from
our previously determined SL3ESS3 structure in which we
showed the apical loop has quasi-stereochemical symmetry. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra recorded
for the double-cytosine-substituted constructs showed that each folds
with the expected stem loop structure (Figure S2 of the ). The additional imino
signal observed for the G8454C construct is missing in the G8454C/G8459C
construct, thus supporting the prediction that a new Watson–Crick
pair forms between G8454C and G8459C.

As with the single-cytosine-substituted
constructs, initial UP1–RNA binding properties were assessed
by size exclusion chromatography (Figure A).
Analysis of the chromatographic traces shows UP1 binds the double-cytosine-substituted
constructs with a 1:1 stoichiometry and with a binding affinity trend
consistent with the single mutants [Kd(G/A)2-to-(C)2 &gt; Kd(U)2-to-(C)2]. The chromatographic titrations of the double mutants
did not show conclusive evidence of a further reduction in binding
affinity compared to those of the single mutants, however.

Double-cytosine
substitutions reveal UP1 makes multiple stabilizing
contacts with the ESS3b loop. (A) Analytical size exclusion chromatographic
titrations of UP1 into double-cytosine-substituted SL3ESS3 constructs performed as described in the legend of Figure . The reduced binding affinities of UP1 for the
G8454C/G8459C and A8455C/A8458C constructs are evident by the amount
of free RNA remaining at a 1:1 molar ratio. (B) Representative isotherms
of UP1 titrated into double-cytosine-substituted SL3ESS3 constructs performed as described in the legend of Figure . The calorimetric results show a further decrease
in binding affinity for the G8454C/G8459C and A8455C/A8458C constructs
relative to those of the single-cytosine substitutions.

To gain a more quantitative description of how
the double-cytosine
substitutions affect UP1 binding affinity, calorimetric titrations
were repeated. The calorimetry results are consistent with the binding
affinity trend observed via size exclusion chromatography (Figure B). As summarized in Table , UP1 binds the U8456C/U8457C construct with an affinity comparable
to that of wild-type SL3ESS3, corresponding to a small
free energy perturbation of 0.5 kcal/mol. This result agrees favorably
with the U8456C (ΔΔG° ≈ 0)
and U8457C (ΔΔG° = 0.6 kcal/mol)
substitutions and further supports the conclusion that UP1 exhibits
low-level discrimination between uracil and cytosine nucleobases.
The G8454C/G8459C construct also binds with comparable affinity to
the corresponding single G-to-C substitutions (Table ). The free energy perturbation for G8454C/G8459C relative
to that of the wild type is 1.1 kcal/mol, whereas the free energy
perturbations for G8454C and G8459C are 1.0 and 0.9 kcal/mol, respectively.
A reasonable interpretation of these results is that sufficient residual
binding energy is provided through favorable interactions with the
remaining wild-type bases so that effects of the double G-to-C substitutions
are compensated. Consistent with this conclusion, the A8455C/A8458C
construct showed a further 2-fold (A8458C) or 6-fold (A8455C) reduction
in binding affinity relative to those of the single A-to-C constructs
and a 20-fold reduction relative to that of wild-type SL3ESS3, which corresponds to a free energy perturbation of 1.8 kcal/mol.
On the basis of these results, we conclude that both GA and AG dinucleotide
steps of the apical loop contribute to high-affinity (Kd &lt; 100 nM) UP1 recognition, where the adenosine bases
form primary contact points.

NMR Detection of Binding Epitopes
To glean further
molecular insight into the UP1–SL3ESS3 binding mechanism,
saturation transfer difference NMR (STD-NMR) was used to probe the
SL3ESS3 binding epitopes. STD-NMR spectroscopy allows direct
detection of protons located at a binding interface by selectively
irradiating NMR signals of a receptor molecule while detecting the
saturation transfer to its bound ligand via a difference spectrum.
Here, NMR signals of UP1 were selectively irradiated, and site-specific
binding epitopes were detected via saturation transfer to SL3ESS3 (Figure ). The SL3ESS3 NMR signals most attenuated by the saturation transfer correspond
to a subset of the aromatic and ribose protons. The sites of closest
contact were more precisely determined by repeating the STD-NMR experiment
with a selectively 2H(GC)-labeled SL3ESS3 construct.
As shown in Figure B, the difference spectrum
reveals the H2 protons of A8455 and A8458 are in the proximity of
UP1. In addition, slightly weaker saturation transfer is observed
to the H1′ positions of A8455 and A8458 along with the H2 and
H5 positions of A8450, U8452, and U8457. Collectively, these results
are consistent with the mutagenesis data presented above and further
indicate UP1 interacts site-specifically with nucleobases of the SL3ESS3 apical loop.

Having identified the UP1 binding epitopes on SL3ESS3, we monitored 1H–15N HSQC titrations
of 15N-labeled UP1 with wild-type SL3ESS3. Using
published chemical shift assignments and our own backbone NMR experiments,
the majority of the free UP1 1H–15N correlation
peaks were assigned for the construct used here. Because of the large
size of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex (∼35 kDa), de novo backbone chemical shift assignments of the complex
have not been completed at this time. Nevertheless, comparing 1H–15N HSQC spectra of the apo and holo forms
of UP1 reveals qualitative information about the binding surface and
possible sites of conformational change. As shown in Figure , large chemical shift perturbations are observed
upon addition of SL3ESS3 to 15N-labeled UP1
(final molar ratio of 1:1), with signals of the free form disappearing
and reappearing at new positions. Stepwise titrations of SL3ESS3 into 15N-labeled UP1 reveal slow exchange on the NMR
chemical shift time scale (Figure B), consistent
with the nanomolar binding affinity determined by calorimetry (Table ). The signals undergoing slow exchange map to a
broad surface that encompasses RRM1, the inter-RRM linker, and RRM2
(Figure C). On RRM1, the amide backbone positions
most affected by addition of SL3ESS3 map to β1 and
β3, whereas the positions showing the largest perturbations
on RRM2 map to β3 and β4. More delocalized perturbations
are observed on α1, α2, and loop 1 from RRM1 as well as
α2 and loop 2 from RRM2. The broad surface detected here is
consistent with our previous results showing both RRM domains of UP1
are necessary to form a high-affinity complex with SL3ESS3. Given the clear evidence of binding
specificity observed in both the chromatographic and calorimetric
titrations along with the specific ESS3b loop epitopes detected by
STD-NMR, a reasonable interpretation of these results is that binding
of SL3ESS3 induces a conformational change in UP1; however,
additional NMR experiments are needed to fully understand the binding
profile reported by the 1H–15N HSQC titrations.

Discussion
Balanced expression of HIV-1 proteins requires
inefficient splicing
of the RNA genome. In addition to suboptimal 3′ acceptor sites,
regulation is mediated through a dynamic competition between host
hnRNP and SR proteins for viral splicing regulatory elements. Efforts
to understand mechanisms of HIV-1 splicing have revealed some splicing
regulatory elements are embedded within stable stem loop structures.
These observations suggest a functional role for RNA structure as
a regulatory factor; however, correlations between RNA structure and
HIV-1 splicing have yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we used
phylogenetics to show the HIV-1 ESS3 stem loop structure is highly
conserved among different group M subtypes. The host hnRNP A1 protein
binds ESS3 to repress splicing at the upstream acceptor site A7, and
our results reveal the binding affinity of the UP1 domain for SL3ESS3 depends on the integrity of the stem loop structure as
well as purine nucleobases within the ESS3b loop. Given these observations,
we hypothesize the ESS3 stem loop structure functions as a “structural
beacon” to direct site-specific and high-affinity hnRNP A1
assembly over otherwise degenerate YAG genomic sites.

Collectively,
the results presented here demonstrate that maintenance
of secondary structure within the ESS3 stem loop structure through
compensatory substitutions has been more conserved throughout the
evolution of HIV-1 than the primary nucleotide sequence. Although
phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences is useful for interpreting
many aspects of evolutionary relationships, conservation and selective
pressure are primarily inferred at the amino acid level, not at the
individual nucleotide level. Conservation through maintenance of base
pairs within RNA secondary structure implicates another level of selective
pressure and demonstrates the power of combining phylogenetic analysis
with methods for analyzing RNA structure.

Although the ESS3
stem loop structure is conserved, subtype-specific
differences in folding patterns and predicted stabilities are seen
(Figure S1 of the ). Of note, the structural predictions shown in Figure S1 of the  do not account for the
possibility of noncanonical base pair interactions within the loop
regions. Five of the 12 subtypes fold with secondary structures identical
to the global consensus structure shown in Figure C, whereas the remaining subtypes show minor structural variations.
ESS3 elements derived from subtypes B, CRF1, and CRF2 fold into stem
loop structures that contain either one or two purine-rich bulges
in the adjacent helical regions. The average predicted thermodynamic
stability for these stem loop structures is −7.3 kcal/mol.
By comparison, the ESS3 stem loop structures derived from subtypes
A1, CRF6, and CRF42 fold with either 2 × 1 or 2 × 2 internal
loops and with a lower average thermodynamic stability (−4.6
kcal/mol). The internal loops of these secondary structures are purine-rich
and could potentially form noncanonical base pairs as observed in
model RNA oligomers.− The F1 subtype shows the most divergent ESS3 stem
loop fold. Its helix is perfectly base paired, and the apical ESS3b
loop is expanded to 11 nucleotides. The four additional nucleotides
are all purines with an alternating GA/AG juxtaposition. The common
feature among all subtypes is an exposed ESS3b loop with a global
consensus 5′-GAUUAGU-3′ motif (Figure B). Low-frequency substitutions are observed at positions
1, 2, and 5, however. Interestingly, in the SL3ESS3 structure
derived from NL4-3, the uracils in positions 3 and 4 form part of
a U-turn-like motif and the uracil in the seventh position is flipped
out. The conservation of uracils at positions 3, 4, and 7 may reflect
pressure to maintain a particular ESS3b stereochemical geometry.

As reported here, the binding affinity of UP1 for ESS3 shows a
striking dependence on the stem loop structure (Figure  and Table ). There is an ∼150-fold
decrease in binding affinity (nanomolar to micromolar) when the apical
sequence is removed from the stem loop context. The large reduction
in stability is accompanied by a marked decrease in binding enthalpy
(ΔΔH° = 29.4 kcal/mol). The magnitude
of ΔΔH° is comparable to binding
enthalpies reported for some single RRM domains bound to short (&lt;8
nucleotides) model RNA oligomers.− This observation indicates the
stability of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex derives in
part from intermolecular contacts that depend on RNA structure. Specific
UP1 recognition of the ESS3b loop embedded within a conserved RNA
structure may explain regulatory properties of hnRNP A1 on splice
site A7, as well as other 3′ acceptor sites. The large binding enthalpy of the UP1–SL3ESS3 complex is consistent with enthalpies reported for other tandem
RRM–RNA interactions where the RNA strands are long enough
to traverse both RRM domains., We previously showed
the tandem RRMs of UP1 are required for high-affinity SL3ESS3 recognition. In light of the data presented
here, we predict the ESS3 stem loop structure facilitates contact
with both RRM domains of UP1, an interaction that obviously does not
take place with the isolated ESS3b loop sequence.

The single-cytosine
substitutions provide further insight into
the role of conserved ESS3b nucleobases. The thermodynamic signatures
reveal UP1 has a preference for purines over pyrimidines, where A8458
and G8459 likely form sites of primary contact. The further reductions
in binding affinity observed for G8454C/G8459C and A8455C/A8458C suggest
partial synergy between pairs of purine nucleobases, although other
effects such as induced changes in the ESS3b loop geometry cannot
be ruled out. In general, these results are consistent with fluorescence
competition experiments that showed UP1 binds purines with higher
affinity than pyrimidines. The data are
also in agreement with available UP1–DNA crystal structures
where stacking interactions between signature aromatic residues (of
the RNP1 and RNP2 motifs) and AG dinucleotides are observed. In line with the available UP1–DNA structures
and consistent with our mutational studies, the STD-NMR spectra reveal
UP1 makes close contact with A8455 and A8459 (Figure B). Furthermore, binding of SL3ESS3 to UP1 induces
changes in the 1H–15N correlation peaks
of both RRM domains and the inter-RRM linker. Collectively, the data
presented here describe a UP1 binding mechanism that is likely very
different from existing models used to interpret the alternative splicing
activity of hnRNP A1.

In summary,
we have shown the ESS3 stem loop structure is phylogenetically
conserved across different HIV-1 group M subtypes. Our results clearly
show the structure and ESS3b nucleobases are key UP1 binding determinants.
On the basis of the collective work presented here, we propose HIV-1
uses RNA structural beacons to direct recruitment of hnRNP A1 to specific
genomic splice sites. It will be of interest to see if the ESS3 structural
variants observed for different HIV-1 subtypes correlate with changes
in UP1 binding affinities and levels of ssA7 usage.
