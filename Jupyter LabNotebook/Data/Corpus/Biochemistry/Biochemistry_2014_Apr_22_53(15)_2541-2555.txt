A central goal of biology is
to understand the factors responsible for the enormous rate enhancements
provided by enzymes. A distinguishing feature of enzymes relative
to small-molecule catalysts is the use of noncovalent interactions
to position substrates and functional groups relative to one another,
and many X-ray structures of enzymes reveal apparent networks of interactions.
However, understanding how these structural features position active
site residues, how important different features are in this positioning,
and how they operate together requires extensive functional tests.

Three catalytic strategies have been identified for the enzyme
ketosteroid isomerase (KSI): stabilization of the incipient oxyanion
via an oxyanion hole, facilitated proton abstraction via a general
base (Figure ), and localization and positioning
of the substrate via binding interactions.− In particular, the nature of the
hydrogen bonding interactions in the oxyanion hole has been extensively
investigated using experimental− and theoretical− approaches. Recently, the oxyanion hole has been fully ablated,
yet 109-fold of the overall 1012-fold catalysis
remains, indicating that other features—those noted above or
hitherto unidentified catalytic sources—are responsible for
the remaining billion-fold catalysis. We previously showed that anion–aromatic interactions with
Phe54 and Phe116 help position the general base carboxylate via favorable
interactions between the carboxylate and the partial positive charges
situated on the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic rings. Here we investigate the roles of more distal active site
interactions to better understand how the general base is positioned.

Steroid
isomerization reaction of (A) 5(10)-estrene-3,17-dione
[5(10)-EST] and (B) 5-androstene-3,17-dione (5-AND) catalyzed by the
general base Asp38 in ketosteroid isomerase in Comamonas testosteroni. The isomerization process involves two sequential proton transfer
reactions: transfer of a proton from C4 of the steroid to Asp38, followed
by transfer of a proton from Asp38 to C6 of the steroid in 5-AND and
C10 of the steroid in 5(10)-EST.

Prior studies have suggested that residues not directly participating
in the chemical transformation can play important roles in enzymatic
catalysis. For example, the activity of a catalytic antibody was increased
by 102-fold through mutation of only non-active site residues,
an effect that was attributed to repositioning active site residues
for optimal geometries. Mutation of loop
residues ∼10 Å from the active site and mutation of residues
directly within the trypsin binding pocket were required to change
the substrate specificity of trypsin to that of chymotrypsin. In each study, the residues identified were
not obvious a priori from visual inspection of the
enzyme’s structure. More generally, the overall folded structure
of an enzyme is necessary to establish the active site architecture
and to position the residues within it.−

Motivated by these and other prior results and the current
challenge
to understand the positioning of catalytic groups, we probed nearby
residues that might contribute to the positioning and thus the function
of the catalytic base Asp38 in KSI. Our results highlight the extended
nature of catalytic sites and the need to understand effects extending
beyond readily identifiable catalytic residues. The insights provided
by this and related studies provide crucial information toward the
development of predictive models to describe the roles of distal residues
and active site features in catalysis.

Methods
All buffers
were prepared with reagent grade materials or better.
All reagents were of the highest purity commercially available (≥97%),
except for the substrate 5(10)estrene-3,17-dione [5(10)-EST] (Steraloids,
Inc.). Solutions of the steroid substrate slowly converted to 4-estrene-3,17-dione
(product) as determined by thin layer chromatography. The concentrations
of substrate stock solutions were determined by measuring the absorbance
change at 248 nm for the acetate-catalyzed conversion of substrate
to product and using the molar absorptivity of the product (14800
M–1 cm–1). Independent measurements with ≥93% pure substrate and ≥99%
pure substrate agreed within experimental error, indicating ≤7%
product in the substrate stock did not affect kinetics measurements.
All substrate stocks contained ≤7% product contamination.

KSI Mutagenesis,
Expression, and Purification
QuikChange
(Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the mutations
into KSI genes from C. testosteroni encoded on pKK22-3
plasmids or pET21c plasmids. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing
mini-prep DNA from DH5α cells. Proteins were expressed and purified
as previously described. The final purity
was &gt;99% as estimated on the basis of a Coomassie-stained sodium
dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. The protein
concentration was determined using the calculated molar extinction
coefficient in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride according to the method
of Gill et al.

Kinetics Experiments
Reactions with 5(10)-EST were
conducted at 25 °C in 10 mM buffer with 2% DMSO (v/v) added as
a cosolvent for substrate solubility, 1 mM sodium EDTA, and 2 mM DTT
and were monitored continuously at 248 nm in a PerkinElmer Lambda
25 spectrophotometer. A constant ionic strength of 100 mM was maintained
in all samples using NaCl. The following buffers were used: sodium
citrate, pH 4.3–5.9; sodium phosphate, pH 6.1–8.0; sodium
3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonate (MOPS), pH 6.3–8.3.
The molar absorptivity for the product of 14800 M–1 cm–1 was previously determined using commercially
available 4-estrene-3,17-dione. The values
of kcat, KM, and kcat/KM were determined by fitting the initial rates as a function of substrate
concentration (typically eight concentrations that varied from 2 to
600 μM) to the Michaelis–Menten equation. At least three
determinations at differing enzyme concentrations (varying at least
4-fold overall) were averaged.

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal diffraction data
were collected at SSRL beamline BL9-1 using a wavelength of 0.98 Å. The reflections were indexed and integrated
with XDS; the intensities
were scaled, merged, and converted to amplitudes with SCALA and TRUNCATE.() Molecular
replacement was performed with AMoRe using
the 3CPO structure, and refinement was performed with REFMAC5.(,) Manual model building was conducted with COOT.()

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Classical MD simulations
of wild-type (WT) and mutant KSIs were initiated from relevant crystal
structures. For WT KSI and the A114G, S42G, and V40G/S42G mutants,
chains C and D of the crystal structure of KSI D38N with bound equilenin
[Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1QJG] were used
as an initial structure. For the D38E and D38E/A114G mutants, chains
A and B of unliganded D38E KSI (PDB entry 4L7K) were used. For the P39G and D38E/P39G mutants, the unliganded structure of
KSI P39A (PDB entry 3MHE) determined herein was used. For the P39G/V40G/S42G mutants, chains
A and B of KSI P39G/V40G/S42G with bound equilenin (PDB entry 3OV4) were used. For
D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G, the crystal structure of unliganded D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G
(PDB entry 3NM2) determined herein was used.

KSI was simulated as a dimer
with bound 17-oxo-andro-3,5-dien-3-olate in all cases. This ligand
corresponds to the intermediate in the steroid isomerization reaction
of 5-androstene-3,17-dione (5-AND), while the kinetics experiments
were performed for the isomerization reaction of the 5(10)-EST substrate
(Figure ). Changes in rates due to mutation
have been shown to be qualitatively consistent between these two substrates. Furthermore, prior simulations using the intermediates
of the isomerization reactions of 5-AND and 5(10)-EST were found to
be qualitatively similar.

The crystal
structures were modified as needed to obtain a complete
dimeric structure of the protein. For simulations initiated from the
P39A crystal structure (PDB entry 3NM2), the complete chain in the asymmetric
unit (chain B) was aligned by root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) minimization
of Cα atoms with respect to the 1QJG crystal structure
to obtain a dimer. Similarly, for D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G, the single
monomeric unit in the structure (PDB entry 3NM2) was aligned by rmsd minimization with
respect to 1QJG to obtain a dimer. Note that the initial conformation of the catalytic
base, residue 38, in the P39G/V40G/S42G and D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G mutants
differs significantly from that of the WT and is directed more toward
the solvent. This difference persists throughout the simulations and
is addressed in . In
the 3NM2 and 3OV4 crystal structures,
residues Pro39Gly, Val40Gly, Gly41, and Ser42Gly were not present
and were added using Profix, with peptide
bonds in the trans conformation, which is consistent
with that observed in the D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G structure (PDB entry 3NM2). In cases where
Ala125 was absent (PDB entries 4L7K and 3OV4), this C-terminal residue was also added
using Profix.

The structures were further modified to incorporate
the ligand,
add protons as needed, and solvate the system. In cases where a bound
equilenin ligand was present (PDB entries 1QJG and 3OV4), an energy-minimized structure of the
steroid intermediate (17-oxo-andro-3,5-dien-3-olate) was aligned with
equilenin by minimizing the rmsd of the C3, O3, C4, C17, and O17 atoms
in the steroid and the corresponding atoms in equilenin. For cases
where equilenin was absent (PDB entries 4L7K and 3NM2), the steroid intermediate was aligned
by minimizing the rmsd of the Cα atoms for each monomer
with respect to the equilenin-bound 1QJG crystal structure. Aspartic acid residues
38 and 99 were considered to be protonated, and the steroid intermediate
was considered to be deprotonated. Histidines 6 and 100 were protonated
at the ε-position, and histidine 122 was doubly protonated,
based on protonation states determined using H++  and inferable hydrogen bonds observed in the 1QJG crystal structure.
Each system was immersed in a truncated octahedral box with 12900
explicit water molecules and four sodium counterions to ensure a neutral
system.

The AMBER99SB force field, was employed
for the
protein, and the rigid TIP3P water model was used for the water molecules. Charges for the intermediate state
of the steroid were determined using the restrained electrostatic
potential (RESP) method and are the same
as those reported previously. Missing
steroid force field parameters were obtained from the Generalized
Amber Force Field (GAFF). A 10 Å
real space cutoff was used for nonbonded interactions, and long-range
electrostatics were treated with the particle mesh Ewald method., Bonds involving hydrogen were constrained to their equilibrium bond
lengths using LINCS.

A multistep
equilibration procedure was performed prior to data
collection for each system. First, the positions of the solvent and
ions were optimized using the steepest descent energy minimization
algorithm; subsequently, the solvent and ions were equilibrated at
constant NVT for 500 ps at 300 K using the Nosé-Hoover
thermostat., Then the positions of the solvent
and ions were optimized again by energy minimization, followed by
optimization of the full system. The system was then annealed from
50 to 300 K, heating in increments of 50 K over 10 ps and maintaining
the temperature during each interval for 50 ps at constant NPT at a pressure of 1 atm using the Nosé-Hoover
thermostat and Parrinello-Rahman barostat. The system was then simulated at constant NPT for
2 ns. A configuration consistent with the equilibrated average volume
from this simulation was extracted and further equilibrated at constant NVT for 2 ns. These simulations were extended for additional
production for 20 ns, and configurations were saved every 1 ps. A
time step of 1 fs was used in all simulations. All simulations were
performed using Gromacs. Two independent
trajectories were performed for each dimeric system, resulting in
data for four active sites that were averaged to obtain the data presented
in the main text; data for individual trajectories are presented in
the .

Results
and Discussion
The general base of KSI, Asp38, is situated
at the end of a β-sheet
and the beginning of a loop (Figure A), with
its side chain proximal to those of Phe54, Met112, Ala114, and Phe116
(Figure B). Prior studies have suggested the
presence of favorable anion–aromatic interactions between the
carboxylate oxygens of Asp38 and the hydrogen atoms on the aromatic
rings of Phe54 and Phe116. A structured
loop connecting two stands of an antiparallel β-sheet via a
β-turn begins with the general
base Asp38 and contains Pro39, Val40, Gly41, Ser42, Glu43, and Pro44,
with a cis peptide linkage between Asp38 and Pro39
(Figure B). Our very simple expectation was
that the structure of this loop and packing interactions with the
nearby hydrophobic side chains would help to orient Asp38 to act as
a general base. However, the underlying energetic contributions to
catalysis of the structured loop and packing interactions cannot be
ascertained through structural inspection alone; in particular, the
structure does not indicate which residues are needed for optimal
general base catalysis, which have larger or smaller contributions,
or whether the entire loop or portions of the loop function as cooperative
units.

the bound substrate during the isomerization reaction. (B) Detailed
view of the general base and surrounding residues with labels. Colors

Prior kinetic studies
showed that the D38E mutation leads to a
240-fold decrease in kcat, and a crystal structure of this mutant showed
that the mutation perturbs the position of the general base by ∼1
Å without introducing additional structural rearrangements. These results suggested that the rate reduction
arises predominantly from local mispositioning of the general base
upon lengthening its side chain by one methylene group and allowed
us to use the D38E mutation in double-mutant systems to probe the
effects of other mutations on general base positioning. In the simplest model, if a residue is important
for positioning the general base, mutation of that residue will lead
to a less deleterious effect in a KSI mutant with an already mispositioned
general base (i.e., in the D38E mutant background) than in WT KSI
with a well-positioned general base (i.e., in the Asp38 background).
We previously applied this double-mutant cycle approach to assess
the roles of Phe54 and Phe116, which directly interact with the Asp38
carboxylate atoms and apparently contribute to the positioning of
the Asp38 carboxylate group via the anion–aromatic interactions
noted above.

To further investigate
the effects of the D38E mutation, we compared
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of WT and D38E KSI (Table  and Figure ). Because we
have more precise structural information for bound equilenin, an intermediate
analogue, than we do for the reaction substrate and product, we simulated
the dynamics of the KSI·intermediate complex (see ). Mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)
calculations of the catalyzed reaction could provide further insight
into the impact of these mutations, but the large number of mutations
in this study and the long simulation times required to achieve convergence
precluded the use of these more expensive methods.

Standard deviations among the four data sets are given in parentheses.

Consistent with the X-ray structures,
the carboxylic acid moiety
of the Glu at position 38 is displaced, with an average donor–acceptor
distance &gt;1 Å larger than that with Asp at this position (Table ). Furthermore, the general base in the D38E mutant
occupies several conformations with different donor–acceptor
distances that are visible in the probability distributions of these
distances (Figures S1 and S2 of the ). Root-mean-square fluctuations (rmsfs) of the
side chain carbon atoms (Table ) and atomic
isodensity surfaces of the general base carboxylate (Figure ) also illustrate more mobility of the general base
than in WT. The MD results are consistent with mispositioning and
a greater degree of motion of the mutant Glu carboxylate group than
of the WT Asp group and support the use of this comparison in double-mutant
cycles designed to probe the effects of packing and loop residues
on the positioning of Asp38.

Hydrophobic Packing with the General Base
Side Chain
Crystal structures of KSI show that the hydrophobic
side chains of
Met112 and Ala114 are situated within 4 Å of the general base
side chain (Figure B), suggesting that hydrophobic
packing with these side chains may restrict the conformational freedom
of the general base and position it within the active site. To functionally
probe this hypothesis, we used double-mutant cycles, illustrated schematically
in Figure A for Ala114, with the M112A and
A114G mutations to reduce the size of each hydrophobic side chain.
The M112A and A114G mutations gave 33- and 225-fold decreases in kcat, respectively (Table , Figure B,C). Throughout this study, we
observe similar reductions in kcat and kcat/KM (Figure S6
of the ) and will
discuss only rate reductions in kcat for
the remainder of the paper. We have utilized a substrate known to
be limited by a chemical rather than physical step;, nevertheless,
there are two chemical steps in the KSI reaction (Figure ), and it is possible that the rate-limiting step
changes with different mutations, an
interesting and potentially informative possibility that is not addressed
in this study.

Double-mutant cycle designed to test the roles of Met112
and Ala114
in positioning the general base. (A) Mutation of Asp38 to the “mispositioned”
Glu general base allows it to populate alternate conformations (vertical
arrows). Mutation of Ala114 affects the positioning of the general
base starting from an enzyme with a positioned general base (top horizontal
arrow) but has a smaller effect for an enzyme with a mispositioned
general base (bottom horizontal arrow). For the sake of clarity, only
the double-mutant cycle for Ala114 is shown. Effects on kcat for mutation of (B) Met112 to Ala and (C) Ala114 to
Gly in KSI with a positioned Asp general base and a mispositioned
D38E mutant general base. Values are from Table .

The A114G mutational effect was
greatly reduced in the D38E mutant
background, from 225- to 15-fold, whereas the M112A effect was within
3-fold in both general base backgrounds. The larger effect of the
Ala114 mutation with Asp than with Glu as the general base suggests
that it helps to position the general base, whereas the similar effect
from mutation of Met112 in both backgrounds suggests that other interactions
are sufficient for near-optimal positioning of the general base. Met112
might instead contribute to catalysis via interactions with the oxyanion
hole, a model that can be tested via future double-mutant cycles with
oxyanion hole mutants, or to the overall stability of the active site.

In MD simulations of the A114G mutant, we
observed a nearly negligible
decrease in the distance between the catalytic base hydroxyl oxygen
and C4 of the steroid and a small yet potentially significant increase
in the distance between the catalytic base hydroxyl oxygen and C6
of the steroid (Table ). In addition to this
change, the active site of the A114G mutant exhibits a small conformational
rearrangement, relative to the WT, with the catalytic base shifted
slightly in the direction of the absent methyl group in Ala114Gly
(Figure ). The remainder of the enzyme’s
structure is unaffected by the A114G mutation (Figure S3 of the ), and the oxyanion hole
hydrogen bonds are maintained (Table S3 of the ). Thus, the MD results support a decrease
in the level of general base function and overall catalysis because
of a reorientation of the carboxylate toward the cavity created by
the A114G mutation (Figure B) and provide
no indication of an effect due to broader conformational sampling
of the carboxylate group (Figure C). We nevertheless
caution that the proton transfer reaction is likely to occur in conformers
with shorter distances between the proton donor and acceptor that are minimally sampled by equilibrium MD
simulations (Figures S1 and S2 of the ).

37–42 and the catalytic base side chain (Asp38) are depicted
as color-coded balls and sticks with the corresponding atoms in the

reference. The average structure of the steroid intermediate from
the MD trajectories is shown as balls and sticks, as well. In addition,
the average structure of Ala114(Gly) is shown for the A114G and V40G/S42G
mutants. A representative data set is shown in each case, with the
remaining data sets provided in the .

Models illustrating possible
effects of mutations on the positioning
of the catalytic base carboxylate group (red) in the KSI active site.
(A) In WT KSI, packing interactions with Ala114 position the Asp carboxylate
relative to the substrate. The cavity created by the Ala114Gly mutation
allows the carboxylate to populate a single mispositioned conformation
(B) or occupy multiple conformations within the active site with a
subset of conformations that are mispositioned (C).

Role of the Catalytic Base Loop in General
Base Positioning
As described above, the general base Asp38
in KSI is situated at
the beginning of a loop that is composed of Pro39, Val40, Gly41, Ser42,
Glu43, and Pro44 (Figure ). This loop connects
two strands of an antiparallel β-sheet and meets the geometrical
definition of a type II β-turn. A role for Pro39 in positioning the general base was suggested previously
by Choi et al. on the basis of the deleterious rate effects from mutations
of Pro39 to alanine or glycine, as well as a crystal structure of
the P39A mutant that showed the general base carboxylate displaced
by ∼3 Å relative to the WT. We mutated each loop residue in both the Asp38 (WT) and D38E mutant
backgrounds to functionally test each for a role in general base positioning,
and we made several combined mutations to probe for cooperative and
collective effects.

Mutations of the loop residues Pro39 and
Val40 to glycine led to 51- and 71-fold decreases in kcat, respectively. Smaller rate reductions of 2–20-fold
were observed for mutations of the remaining residues in the loop,
G41V, S42G, E43G, and P44G (Figure  and Figure
S7 of the ). In the
D38E background, mutation of residues 42 and 44 led to 2–3-fold
rate reductions, slightly smaller than in the WT background, suggesting
only a small role of these residues in general base positioning. In
contrast, mutation of Glu43 to glycine in the mispositioned D38E background
gave effects that were ∼2-fold larger than in the native Asp38
background, suggesting that Glu43 plays a slightly larger role in
catalysis with the mutant Glu than with the native Asp general base.

Double-mutant
cycles designed to test the role of the loop residues
Pro39–Pro44 in positioning the general base. Effects on kcat for the mutation of loop residues in KSI
with a positioned Asp38 general base and a mispositioned D38E mutant
general base are shown. Values are plotted relative to WT KSI on the
left-hand side and relative to the D38E mutant on the right-hand side.
Data are from Table .

Turning to the residues giving the largest effects, Pro39,
Val40,
and Gly41, we found that the rate reduction due to mutation of each
of these residues was considerably smaller in the D38E background
than with the WT Asp general base (Figure  and Figure S7 of the ), suggesting that each of these residues plays a role in positioning
the general base for catalysis. Mutation of Pro39 to glycine in the
D38E background retained a 13-fold rate decrease, apparently consistent
with Pro39 also providing some positioning for the mutant Glu general
base.

These kinetics results for each loop
residue mirror the conservation
of each position. A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), sequence search for KSI gave 419 sequences with an Asp residue at
the position equivalent to Asp38. All of these sequences had proline
at position 39 and glycine at position 41; position 40 was highly
conserved as a hydrophobic residue (313 Val, 51 Ile, 47 Leu, and 7
Ala residues and 1 Phe residue). Conversely, the amino acids present
at positions 42–44, which had the smallest functional impacts,
were variable. These observations are broadly consistent with homology
studies of β-turns in proteins, which have shown that the analogues
of positions 39 and 40 exhibit slight preferences for proline, while
the analogues of positions 41 and 42 exhibit slight preferences for
glycine.,

Overall, these results lead to the
general conclusion that the
loop aids in positioning the general base; i.e., the anion–aromatic
interactions with Phe54 and Phe116 and the side chain packing with
Ala114 are not alone sufficient to favor an optimally positioned general
base carboxylate group. These results further suggest that the loop
does not act as a single cooperative unit: there are different effects
at different positions, and there are different levels of importance
of individual residues, relative to the alternative mutated residues,
in positioning the general base Asp38. Below we further analyze the
effects of each mutation and the role of each loop residue.

Pro39
The effect of Pro39 mutations in both the WT
and D38E backgrounds could result from restriction of the conformational
freedom of the backbone, and/or from accessing
conformations favored by a cis peptide bond. Proline
is unique among the amino acids in its ability to adopt a stable cis isomer of its peptide bond, and the cis conformation is conserved in the two homologous KSIs for which structures
are available., In contrast, the trans isomer is observed in crystal structures of Pro39 mutants, suggesting
that the cis conformation may be important for KSI
activity. To learn more about the role
of Pro39, we turned to MD simulations.

simulations of WT KSI and the P39G mutant reveals a greatly perturbed
average structure of the loop in the P39G mutant (Figure ), suggesting that the remainder of the loop must
compensate for the trans conformation at the mutant
position to bring the loop back to the core β-strands that it
connects. Furthermore, the larger rmsfs of the Cα atoms of each loop residue in the P39G mutant, relative to WT (Table ), and the broader distributions of dihedral angles
for the other loop residues for the P39G mutant, relative to WT (Figure ), are indicative of increased loop flexibility.

Results obtained by averaging over
two 20 ns MD trajectories and two active sites. Standard deviations
among the four data sets are shown in parentheses.

These results suggest that the P39G
mutation increases the conformational
flexibility of the backbone in the loop that bears the general base,
but a catalytic effect would arise only if the base itself were mispositioned
or exhibited increased flexibility. The MD simulations show increased
average proton donor–acceptor distances for both proton transfer
positions relative to those of the WT (Table ), and the probability distributions of these distances are broader,
as well (Figures S1 and S2 of the ), consistent with the rate reductions observed experimentally. These
probability distributions and the three-dimensional atomic isodensity
surfaces of the catalytic base carboxylate (Figure ) reveal two types of conformations: a “catalytically
competent” type (loosely defined), in which the carboxylic
acid group is situated near C6 of the steroid, and a “catalytically
incompetent” type, in which the carboxylic acid is disordered
and interacts with the solvent. The most probable
distances in each type of conformation are provided in Tables S1 and
S2 of the .

The functional and MD results together suggest that Pro39 works
with the rest of the loop to position the catalytic base such that,
when Pro39 is mutated to glycine, the mutant residue adopts the trans configuration, the remaining loop residues become
more flexible, and the positioning of the general base side chain
is disrupted. The cis conformation is ∼2.5
kcal/mol less stable than the trans conformation
for non-prolyl amino acids in solution, providing an estimate for the upper limit of the conformational
preference of the remaining loop residues of the Pro39 mutants for
the cis conformation relative to the trans conformation.

Val40
A recent study using continuum
electrostatics
calculations and a structure-based algorithm to predict catalytically
important residues in enzymes suggested that remote residues make
only small contributions to catalysis in the homologous KSI from Pseudomonas putida. However,
we observe a 71-fold rate decrease with the distal V40G mutation (Figure ).

Structural inspection revealed that Val40
is situated at the interface of the KSI dimer and is positioned to
pack against Val74 in a loop in the adjacent monomer (Figure A), raising the possibility that packing interactions
extending across the dimer interface contribute to function. To test
whether loop–loop packing interactions across the dimer interface
could help structure the loop adjacent to Asp38 and thereby help to
position the general base, we determined the effect of the V74G mutation
in KSI with the structured WT loop and in a construct with multiple
loop residues mutated to glycine (P39G/V40G/S42G) to ensure that loop
positioning was disrupted (as will be discussed further below).

Double-mutant
cycle analysis designed to test the hypothesis that
packing interactions across the dimer interface position the general
base in KSI. (A) In WT KSI, Val40 of monomer A (gray) and Val74 of
monomer B (gold) are situated near each other. (B) Effects on kcat for mutation of Val74 to Gly with a WT loop
sequence and with the loop residues mutated to glycine are shown,
where the Gly loop designation refers to the P39G/V40G/S42G mutant
background. Values are averages from three or more independent measurements
and are from Table .

The V74G mutation decreased activity 5-fold with the loop
residues
intact, whereas the same mutation slightly increased activity in an
enzymatic background with the loop residues mutated to glycine (Figure B). These data suggest that packing interactions
across the dimer interface provide a modest but significant contribution
to the positioning of the general base.

To gain insight into the effects of the V74G mutation and the residues
with which it interacts, we examined the average structures from the
MD simulations of each mutant in the residues proximal to Val74. In
MD simulations of the P39G mutant (and other mutants containing the
P39G mutation), we observe a conformational change in the backbone
of residues 74–76 (Figure  and Figure
S13 of the ), whereas
the average structure of residues 74–76 is well maintained
in MD simulations of WT KSI and mutants not containing the P39G mutation.
This observation suggests the existence of a structural link between
these sites such that a perturbation in one loop affects the structure
of the other across the dimer interface. On the basis of the contributions
of the residues in the general base loop to positioning the general
base described above, these results are consistent with packing interactions
between these loops that affect each loop’s structure and thereby
help to position the general base.

Ribbon diagrams of the average structure
of WT KSI (left) and the
P39G mutant (right), both colored gray, highlighting the conformational
changes in the catalytic base loop residues (38–43, green)
and the proximal residues across the dimeric interface (74–76,
blue). The backbone structures of these two regions in the D38N-equilenin
crystal structure (PDB entry 1QJG) are colored red for reference. Structures were aligned
by minimization of the rmsd of the Cα atoms in the
dimer.

An alternative model for the effects
of the V40G mutation is suggested
by inspection of crystal structures. Val40 is situated to pack against
the residues in the β-strand bearing Ala114, which positions
the general base via hydrophobic packing interactions with its side
chain as described above. Mutation of Val40 might disrupt the positioning
of the general base by perturbing the packing interactions with the
adjacent β-strand, thereby perturbing the packing interactions
between Ala114 and the general base. The 71- and 5-fold rate reductions
due to the V40G and V74G mutations, respectively, are smaller than
the 200-fold rate reduction due to the A114G mutation, which is consistent
with the rate effects of the V40G and V74G mutations acting through
Ala114, whereby hydrophobic packing interactions with Val40 and secondary
effects from Val74 would help position Ala114, which in turn positions
the general base as described above.

To probe this alternative
model, we examined the average structure
from MD simulations of the V40G/S42G mutant. The structure of this
mutant exhibits a conformational change in the general base side chain
that is similar to the conformational change observed upon mutation
of Ala114 (Figure ). In addition to this change,
the average structure of Ala114 in the V40G/S42G mutant is shifted
further from the general base side chain relative to its position
in the WT enzyme. These observations are consistent with the model
in which mutations of the more distal Val40 and Val74 affect the positioning
of the general base via perturbation of the packing interactions between
the general base Asp38 and the hydrophobic side chain of Ala114. This
model leads to the testable prediction that the V40G and V74G mutations
will be less deleterious in the A114G background.

Gly41
The loop residue Gly41 was found to be conserved
among KSI homologues in a BLAST sequence search and occurs at a position
of a β-turn that is frequently glycine according to surveys
of the Protein Data Bank., Furthermore, KSI crystal
structures indicate that the backbone dihedral angles of Gly41 are
in a region of the Ramachandran plot that is unfavorable for all other
amino acids (Figure ). The 14- and 20-fold
rate decreases observed experimentally for the G41A and G41V mutations,
respectively (Table ), support the hypothesis
that adoption of a backbone conformation more favorable for glycine
than for the other amino acids at position 41 is important for the
loop structure, Asp38 positioning, and thus KSI activity. Furthermore,
the smaller 4-fold effect of the G41V mutation in the D38E mutant
background suggests that Gly41 helps to position the general base.
The similar rate reductions from mutations of Gly41 to alanine and
the bulkier valine provide no support for the alternative model in
which unfavorable steric overlap involving the side chain is responsible
for the rate reductions in these mutants.

MD simulations of
WT KSI and the D38E mutant reveal the preponderance of a single conformation
of Gly41, one that is unfavorable for all other amino acids (Figure ). We did not perform MD simulations of the Gly41
mutants, because of the unavailability of an appropriate crystal structure,
but in simulations of mutants with P39G, multiple conformations of
Gly41 are observed, including regions of Ramachandran space that are
accessible to all other amino acids and not unique to glycine residues
(Figure ). Gly41 appears to aid general base
positioning and catalysis by allowing a loop conformation that requires
occupancy of a region of Ramachandran space that is inaccessible to
other amino acids.

Ser42, Glu43, and Pro44
The observation,
described
above, that the overall structure of the loop is important for general
base positioning and KSI activity might suggest significant contributions
from all of the residues in the loop. In particular, crystal structures
of KSI illustrate that the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser42 is positioned
to hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of Pro39, suggesting
that this interaction could stabilize the native loop structure. Nevertheless,
the S42G mutation led to an only 6-fold rate decrease (Figure ). The results from MD simulations of the S42G mutant
are virtually indistinguishable from those of WT KSI in all analyses
performed: donor–acceptor distances (Table ), atomic isodensity surfaces (Figure S4 of the ), and Ramachandran plots
(Figure S5 of the ). These similarities in the MD simulations are consistent with the
small experimental rate reduction.

Mutations of the remaining
residues comprising the loop, Glu43 and Pro44, led to rate reductions
of 2- and 11-fold, respectively, for kcat (Figure ). Surprisingly, mutation of Glu43
to glycine in the mispositioned D38E background gave effects that
were ∼2-fold larger than in the native Asp38 background. Alternate
conformations may be allowed with E43G that increase the probability
of reaction utilizing the alternative Glu38 general base. Future tests
of our understanding might involve attempts to reoptimize catalysis
with Glu at position 38 or at other positions in the loop.−

Multiple Glycine Mutations for Evaluating the Contribution of
the Full Loop to General Base Positioning
To obtain an upper
bound on the catalytic effect of the loop, we mutated all of the loop
residues to a polyglycine loop and conducted a double-mutant cycle
analysis as described above. Mutation of the loop to an all-glycine
sequence with Asp38 present led to a 1700-fold rate decrease (Figure A), and mutation to Glu38 had no additional effect
(Figure B), indicating that any preferential
positioning of Asp at position 38 had been eliminated.

Double-mutant
cycle analysis designed to test the collective role
of the catalytic base loop in positioning the general base in the
KSI active site. (A) Effects on kcat for
mutation of the residues in the loop to glycine, where the Gly loop
designation refers to the P39G/V40G/S42G/E43G/P44G mutant. (B) Effects
on kcat for mutation of the Asp38 general
base to Glu with a WT loop sequence and with the residues in the loop
mutated to glycine. Values are from Table .

The 1700-fold effect from conversion
to the all-glycine loop (Figure A) is larger
than the 240-fold effect from mutating
Asp to Glu with the WT loop (Figure B) and
constitutes our best estimate for the full contribution of the loop
to positioning, relative to an unpositioned loop. The smaller effect
from the D38E mutation alone, with the WT loop present, would be expected
if the WT loop helped position Glu to function as the general base,
relative to an all-glycine loop. Alternatively, the larger effect
on activity from conversion to the all-glycine loop with Asp38 present
could arise from secondary structural effects from mutation of the
loop that impair catalysis in other ways. However, the similar KM values for WT KSI and the all-glycine loop
mutant (Table ) provide no evidence for binding
effects due to the mutations, and several additional observations,
described below, also provide no indication of structural rearrangements
beyond the general base position. We therefore suggest that the 1700-fold
effect provides a reasonable measure of the overall positioning effect
from the loop, relative to the unstructured all-glycine loop and in
the context of the rest of KSI being folded.

To directly test whether mutating
multiple loop residues to glycine
introduces further structural rearrangements, we determined the crystal
structures of the P39G/V40G/S42G (PDB entry 3OV4) and D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G
(PDB entry 3NM2) mutants at 1.8 and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively. Refinement
details are given in Table S4 of the . The catalytic rates of the these mutants are within
2-fold of the catalytic rates of the all-glycine loop mutants, and
the D38E mutation has a negligible rate effect in both the P39G/V40G/S42G
and all-glycine mutant backgrounds (Table ), suggesting that these structures are representative of the all-glycine
loop mutants.

The overall structures of these mutants can be
superimposed with
that of WT KSI [PDB entry 8CHO()] with Cα rmsds of 0.71 and 0.52 Å, respectively, for a single monomer,
excluding residues 38–42, suggesting that these mutations do
not cause significant rearrangements outside of the loop. We observed
poor electron density for the loop backbone atoms in both structures,
suggesting that the loop is disordered, as would be expected.

This disorder observed in the loop residues appears to affect general
base positioning. In the P39G/V40G/S42G mutant, the loop residues
have poorly defined electron density, the refined position of the
Asp38 carboxylate group in all four chains of the asymmetric unit
is displaced by ∼2.5 Å relative to that of the WT (Figure ), and the normalized B factors
in the Asp38 side chain are larger than those in the WT enzyme (Table
S5 of the ). Furthermore, a distinct refined position of
this carboxylate group is found in each
asymmetric unit of this structure. These structural data, similar
to the functional data presented above, suggest that the all-glycine
loop disrupts positioning of the Asp38 general base.

Superposition of the
1.8 Å structure of the P39G/V40G/S42G
mutant determined herein (PDB entry 3OV4, carbon atoms colored green) and the
previously determined 2.3 Å structure of WT KSI (PDB entry 8CHO, carbon atoms colored
blue). In both structures, oxygen atoms are colored red and sulfur
atoms yellow. The crystal structure of the P39G/V40G/S42G mutant shows
that the base is mispositioned relative to WT KSI in all four chains
in the asymmetric unit. The overall root-mean-square deviation between
the two structures for backbone atoms is 0.6 Å. For the sake
of clarity, only the A chain is shown for the P39G/V40G/S42G structure.
The Asp38 carboxylate group is displaced by ∼2.5 Å in
the mutant compared to WT KSI, as indicated by the green and blue
circles, respectively.

To further investigate the positioning of the general base
in the
polyglycine loop mutants, we performed MD simulations of the P39G/V40G/S42G
and D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G mutants and compared these results to those
of the single mutants examined above. The calculated rmsfs of Cα atoms in the loop (Table )
suggest that the rmsfs of the polyglycine mutants are similar to or
smaller than those of the single glycine mutant, a result that is
somewhat surprising. Ramachandran plots of the residues in the loop
(Figure ), however, illustrate that the polyglycine
loop mutants P39G/V40G/S42G and D38E/P39G/V40G/S42G exhibit many local
minima in residues 39–42, consistent with the presence of a
disordered loop. We caution that while these distributions illustrate
an increase in the number of allowed conformations for the polyglycine
mutants, they may not be quantitatively accurate on the basis of the
limitations of equilibrium MD simulations.

The increased flexibility
observed in MD simulations of the loop
due to polyglycine mutation would impact the rate only if it affects
the reactive interface of the general base and the substrate. The
average donor–acceptor distances from these simulations are
larger than those of the single-glycine mutants and significantly
larger than those observed in the WT (Table ). The distance distributions are slightly broader than those of
the single mutants, as well (Figures S1 and S2 of the ). These results support
the presence of an increased level of disorder in the general base
side chain and are consistent with the experimentally observed rate
reductions (Table ). The slightly broader
configuration space sampled by the general base can be visualized
in the atomic isodensity surfaces (Figure ).

Finally, we asked whether the loop residues act independently
or
cooperatively to position the general base. In a model of full cooperativity
of all of the loop residues, any mutation in the loop would disrupt
the positioning of the general base. This was ruled out by the data
presented above showing that single mutations in different loop residues
gave different effects (Figure ). Figure  shows the results of successively mutating loop
residues to Gly. The increasing effect from adding more residues again
argues against the unlikely fully cooperative model. On the other
hand, the effect from mutation to the all-glycine loop of 1700-fold
is much smaller than that predicted from a model of fully independent
contributions from each residue. Such a model predicts multiplicative
effects from the individual mutations and an effect of 105.7-fold (Table ). Thus, an intermediate model
is supported in which the residue identity at individual loop positions
affects the contributions from certain other residues. Accurately
describing the detailed nature of the partially cooperative interactions
among these loop residues, as well as designing alternative yet effective
loop sequences, provides future challenges for both theory and experiment.

Effects
of mutating multiple loop residues to glycine on kcat in KSI with a positioned Asp38 general base
and a mispositioned Glu (D38E mutant) general base. Values are plotted
relative to that of WT KSI on the left-hand side and relative to that
of the D38E mutant on the right-hand side. Data are from Table .

Conclusions and Implications
We draw enzyme mechanisms showing so-called catalytic residues,
but we know that these residues must be placed within the context
of a folded protein. Understanding the functional interrelationships
between the catalytic groups and their protein surroundings is an
important and difficult current challenge in enzymology. Developments
in this area have implications for understanding how enzymes have
evolved and for developing effective strategies for designing protein
and nonprotein catalysts with activities and specificities that rival
those of naturally occurring enzymes. Our results reveal interrelationships
involving and surrounding a highly efficient general base within an
enzyme active site and provide valuable benchmarks to facilitate the
development of general and quantitative models for these effects.

Prior work provided strong evidence of anion–aromatic interactions
between the Asp38 carboxylate oxygen atoms and two active site Phe
residues, and such interactions appear to be a common alternative
to hydrogen bond networks for positioning catalytic residues. Packing interactions of Ala114 but not Met112
with the Asp38 side chain contribute to its positioning and function.
These disparate observations underscore the need to supplement structural
studies with functional analysis, and double-mutant cycles as conducted
herein are particularly incisive as functional probes.

The loop
that begins with the general base (Figure ) also contributes to its positioning, and we have uncovered
catalytic contributions as large as 103-fold from this
loop. From another perspective, the anion–aromatic and packing
interactions are insufficient to optimally position the general base,
a conclusion that could not have been drawn from structural inspection
alone. Further investigation of the loop contributions, via functional
analysis, structural determination, and simulations, revealed differential
contributions from individual loop residues and further suggested
contributions both from disfavoring alternative, noncatalytic conformations
and from limiting the mobility of the general base.

Multiple interactions
position the general base in the KSI active
site. The structural model shows the residues that have been mutated
as sticks. Residues are colored according to the interaction suggested
from the functional and structural data to position the general base.

The residues of the loop bearing
the general base in KSI exhibit
partial cooperativity [i.e., mutations of different loop residues
have different effects, and mutations of multiple residues have effects
beyond mutation of the first (Figure )],
but these effects fall far short of exhibiting energetic independence.
Structurally, given the limited packing of protein loops relative
to their interiors, we might generally expect multistate structural
behavior of loops, with multiple conformational states explored and
mutations affecting the “shape” of the conformational
energy landscape, in contrast to a single dominant folded–unfolded
transition as in a two-state, fully cooperative process.

Protein
sectors have been suggested to evolve and function together,, and evolution has “mixed and matched” domains, as
in dehydrogenases that use the same NAD(P)H cofactor but reduce different
substrates., The KSI loop adjoining Asp38
appears to position this residue to act as a general base without
influencing substrate binding or the neighboring oxyanion hole. Identifying
functional regions such as this may ultimately define the extent of
interactions needed to create a functional catalytic motif, whether
through evolution or design, and may allow us to independently alter
substrate specificity and/or mutate the catalytic residue into another
catalytically active group to perform distinct chemistries.

Understanding protein substates, the conformational ensembles that
describe them, and how such ensembles can be shaped and limited by
engineering and by evolution to allow specificity and catalysis present
major current challenges that will likely require a tight feedback
loop between experiment and computation. Here we have begun this interaction
focusing on the groups interacting with KSI’s general base,
and new predictions arise from the MD simulations conducted herein.
Nevertheless, we emphasize the need, moving forward, to further develop
computational methods that can efficiently provide extensive quantitative
and nontrivial predictions that can subsequently and independently
be experimentally tested.

In cases where similar mutational
effects are observed in the WT and D38E backgrounds, it is also possible
that the residue in question contributes similarly in positioning
the D38 and D38E side chains for general base function. This alternative
model is not supported by the evidence noted above that Glu positioning
is different from that of Asp and does not utilize anion–aromatic
interactions with Phe56 and Phe116.

The proton transfer reaction will
occur at distances significantly shorter than those sampled in equilibrium
MD simulations. Here, we define catalytically competent conformations
as those with proton donor–acceptor distances similar to those
observed in simulations of WT KSI, whereas catalytically incompetent
conformations are those with large donor–acceptor distances
(&gt;4 Å).
