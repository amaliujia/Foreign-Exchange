Despite improvements
in chemotherapy,
BRAF/MEK inhibitors, cytokine treatments, immunotherapies, vaccines,
and combinatorial approaches for treating malignant melanoma (MM),− long-term survival (&gt;3 years) remains very poor for a majority
of
patients (&gt;70%), and side effects from these treatments are sometimes
quite severe.,, These
issues are even more problematic after the onset of metastasis and/or
when drug-resistant mechanisms arise., As with many
cancers, survival from MM is most promising when it is detected early,
so the development of useful biomarkers for detection and more recently
for personalized medicine approaches is ongoing., One
such marker, S100B, is especially important to monitor because its
level is elevated in &gt;90% of MM patients and its protein level
correlates
directly with poor survival (&lt;1 year) and relapse, and it is especially
predictive when used in combination with other diagnostic indicators.− On the other hand, for the few MM patients (5–10%) who have
low levels of S100B, the MM vaccine is most effective at providing
longer survival times.,

The S100B protein is a
marker for melanoma, and when its level
is elevated, it contributes to disease progression., While the mechanism of elevated S100B levels toward MM progression
is not fully understood, it contributes to lowering protein levels
of the tumor suppressor p53 in a Ca2+-dependent manner., Specifically, p53 is sequestered by Ca2+-bound S100B
(CaS100B), its phosphorylation in the C-terminal negative
regulator domain blocked,− its oligomerization disrupted, and its degradation promoted.,,, Because p53
is typically wild-type in MM,, efforts are underway
to specifically inhibit formation of the CaS100B–p53
complex,, and restore
p53 levels, particularly in cases in which the cancer is resistant
to kinase inhibitors or other therapeutic options. As a proof of principle, blocking the CaS100B-dependent
effect on p53 via RNA interference or by small molecule inhibitors
(also known as SBiXs) restores p53 protein levels
and its tumor suppression activities, including UV-activated apoptosis.,, One such inhibitor, pentamidine
(also termed SBi1), entered stage II clinical trials for the treatment
of relapsed or refractory malignant melanoma in patients with wild-type
p53 and detectable S100B (www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier
NCT00729807). However, despite this promising line of inquiry, efficacy,
specificity, and toxicity issues need to be improved significantly
for SBiX lead molecules and warrant further investigation
using drug design approaches.

In previous structure–function
studies of S100B,− three persistent binding sites were identified in CaS100B–target
and CaS100B–SBiX complexes (Figure ). Site 1 interactions were first highlighted via
the structure of CaS100B bound to the C-terminal regulatory
domain of p53, while sites 2 and 3 were
elucidated in the detailed characterization of the CaS100B–SBi1
complex. Here we describe a series of
inhibitors, which occupy only the central binding site on CaS100B (site 2) through a covalent attachment to Cys84. To fully characterize
this binding site, a series of “site 2” CaS100B–SBiX complexes were subjected to crystallization
trials. Five new CaS100B–SBiX complexes
were identified (i.e., for CaS100B–SC124, CaS100B–SBi4172, CaS100B–SC1982, and CaS100B–SC1475). As a group, these “site 2”
inhibitors display a meaningful effect in cellular assays on their
own, but as discussed here, they also provide promise for defining
how to link SBiX molecules bound in sites 1 and 3,
as part of a new chemical scaffold, which can occupy all three persistent
binding pockets within CaS100B, simultaneously. These data
also identify a common conformational change that occurs as a result
of “site 2” occupation, which is necessary to consider
in future therapeutic design efforts.

Binding sites 1–3. Shown is a ribbon
diagram of the S100B
dimer with the three persistent binding sites shaded. The sites were
identified in CaS100B–target and CaS100B–SBiX complexes. Site 1 interactions were first highlighted
via the structure of CaS100B bound to the C-terminal regulatory
domain of p53, while sites 2 and 3 were
elucidated in the detailed characterization of the CaS100B–SBi1
complex.

Experimental Procedures
Purification
15N-labeled
S100B (rat and
bovine) was expressed and purified (&gt;99%) with methods similar
to
those described previously., The concentrations
of S100B stock solutions were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA). The S100B was stored at a concentration
of ∼10 mM in 0.25 mM Tris (pH 7.2) and 0.25 mM DTT at −20
°C until use.

Fluorescence Polarization Competition Assay
(FPCA)
The LOPAC1280 (Sigma-Aldrich) compound library was
screened using
an adaptation of a previously reported fluorescence polarization competition
assay. Briefly, the compounds were screened
for binding to Ca2+-loaded S100B by measuring changes in
fluorescence polarization upon competition with the TAMRA-labeled
version of peptide TRTK12, which is derived from CapZ protein residues
265–276 (TRTKIDWNKILS).
The FPCA was performed in 0.2 μM S100B (rat), 25 nM TAMRA-TRTK12,
50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 0.3% DMSO in 1536-well plates with 8 μL
per well.

NMR Spectroscopy
Purified 15N-labeled S100B
(rat) protein was dialyzed against 0.25 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 0.25
mM DTT and concentrated to 10–15 mM using Amicon Ultra centrifugal
filter units with a 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff; the concentration
was determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and protein was then
aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. The Ca2+-loaded
S100B–SBiX heteronuclear single-quantum coherence
(HSQC) samples contained 0.5 mM S100B subunit, 0.625 mM SBiX, 0.34 mM NaN3, 15 mM NaCl, 5% DMSO-d6, 10 mM CaCl2, 10% D2O, 0.2% TPEN, and 10 mM Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.2 with HCl. HSQC
NMR data were collected at 37 °C with a Bruker Avance 800 US2
(800.27 MHz for protons) instrument equipped with pulsed-field gradients,
four frequency channels, and triple-resonance, z-axis
gradient cryogenic probes. Data were processed with NMRPipe, and proton
chemical shifts were reported with respect to the H2O or
HDO signal taken as 4.608 ppm relative to external TSP (0.0 ppm).
The 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced as previously
described using the following ratio of the zero-point frequency: 0.10132905
for 15N to 1H. A series of three-dimensional
HNCA, HNCOCA, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-edited
HMQC-NOESY-HSQC NMR experiments were conducted, and the data were
sufficient to unambiguously assign all the observable backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift values
of S100B in the compound-bound state (Figures S1–S5 of the ).

Crystallographic Studies
Crystallization
All crystallization experiments were
conducted using vapor diffusion methods and performed as follows using
purified 15N-labeled S100B (bovine) protein. CaS100B–SBi4172 crystals were grown in sitting drops consisting

CaCl2, and 4 mM SC1475 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1
M Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. CaS100B–SC124
crystals were grown in sitting drops consisting of a 0.75:0.75 μL
protein solution [40 mg/mL S100B, 10 mM cacodylate (pH 7.2), 7.5 mM
CaCl2, and 4 mM SC124 prepared in DMSO-d6] and mother liquor [40% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1
M Hepes (pH 7.0), and 7.5 mM CaCl2]. The crystals were
grown over a period of 1–14 days at 295 K. Crystals were flash-cooled
directly from the crystallization drop.

Structure
Determination and Refinement
To determine
the structure of CaS100B in complex with SBiXs, we performed molecular replacement (MR). A search model from a
previous S100B structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1MHO(,)] was generated by removing coordinates for ligands and water. Molecular
replacement was conducted within the AUTOMR function of the PHENIX software suite.
The models were finished by manual building within COOT. The models were refined by the PHENIX.REFINE function of the PHENIX software suite. Ligands and waters were incorporated into the models
by visual inspection of the |Fo| –
|Fc| omit maps. The structure refinement
statistics are summarized in Table .

Cell-Based Assay with WM115 Malignant Melanoma Cells
The
malignant melanoma cell line, WM115, was obtained from American
Type Tissue Collection (ATCC) and cultured in minimum essential medium
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 100 units/mL penicillin-streptomycin (PS). The cells were
infected with SMARTvector 2.0 lentiviral particles containing either
nontargeting scrambled or anti-S100B shRNA according to manufacturer’s
recommendations (Thermo Scientific-Dharmacon). The following day,
the medium containing lentivirus was removed, the cells were washed
twice with PBS and trypsinized, and each well was expanded into a
24-well plate containing growth medium supplemented with puromycin
(0.5 μg/mL). Upon confluence, the wells were trypsinized and
single-cell diluted into 96-well plates. Positive clones with a reduction
in the level of S100B protein expression were maintained in puromycin-containing
medium.

A cellular screen was then
developed with these WM115 cell lines, and further test compounds
were shown to bind S100B in vitro. In this cellular
assay, the ability of SBiX molecules to inhibit the
growth of WM115 melanoma cells infected with shRNA lentivirus (Dharmacon)
targeting S100B (shRNAS100B, i.e., low S100B) or a scrambled
control (shRNAscrambled, i.e., high S100B) was examined
quantitatively. The methods used were similar to those used previously
and included the use of a Biomek FX Laboratory Automation Workstation
(Beckman-Coulter) equipped with a 96-channel pipetting head. Specifically, 20 μL of MEM (Corning) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μg/mL puromycin, and 1% Pen/Strep
was added to each well of a 384-well, clear bottom, tissue culture
plate (Corning) containing 600 cells per well such that growing uninhibited
they reach 80% confluence in 5 days. After the cells had grown for
24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidity-controlled incubator,
20 μL of the compound was added directly to the cell culture
medium, while control cultures received an equivalent amount of DMSO.
After being incubated for an additional 4 days, the cells were lysed
by transferring 20 μL of lysis buffer consisting of 1.8% Igepal
with a 1:10000 dilution of SYBR Green I (10000×, Invitrogen)
to each well. The plates were then returned to the incubator for 24
h. The fluorescence intensity was then read through the bottom of
the plate using a PolarStar fluorescent plate reader (BMG) using 485
nm excitation and 520 nm emission filters. The SYBR Green fluorescence
is used to measure total DNA that in turn correlates with the cell
number as previously described. The EC50 of each compound was determined using serial dilutions and
performed in a minimum of three replicates. Hill curves of each replicate
were generated using Origin Data Analysis Software.

To analyze
changes in total p53 protein levels upon treatment with
SC1982, WM115 cells were seeded in triplicate at a density of 70 ×
105 cells in 60 mm dishes in 1× MEM (Cellgro) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL PS, and 0.5 μg/mL puromycin and allowed
to adhere overnight. The following day, the old medium was removed
and new medium containing 5 μM SC1982 or DMSO was added. The
cells were harvested 4 h post-treatment using cold 1× RIPA lysis
buffer [0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 M NaCl, 2.5% deoxycholic acid,
10% Igepal, and 10 mM EDTA] and subjected to Western blotting.

Western blotting was performed using 30 μg of cell lysates
loaded on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
gel (NuPage), which was subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes
(Millipore) and reacted with p53 mouse monoclonal antibody (DO-1,
Santa Cruz), mouse anti-S100B antibody (BD Biosciences), and mouse
anti-GAPDH antibody at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers.
The blots were then reacted with goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories) and treated with Immobilon Western
Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) at dilutions recommended
by the manufacturer.

Results
The binding of CaS100B to p53 downregulates tumor suppressor
activity in cancer cells such as malignant melanoma,, so a search for small molecule inhibitors that bind CaS100B and prevent formation of the CaS100B–p53
complex was undertaken. A fluorescence polarization competition assay
(FPCA) was performed against the 1280-compound Library of Pharmacologically
Active Compounds (LOPAC1280). Because of the location
of Cys84 within the CaS100B binding pocket (i.e., between
sites 1 and 3), the focus of this investigation was a series of covalent
complexes from this that were predicted to covalently bind at Cys84
of CaS100B. SBi4172 is a structural analogue of the covalent
modifier SC0844 and was thought to bind
similarly. SC124, or disulfiram, is a known covalent modifier. The chemical nature of SBi4434 suggests the
possibility of adduct formation and is confirmed here. To gain additional
opportunities for characterization of covalent adducts, compounds
were also taken from a previously reported screen versus the 2000-compound
Spectrum Collection. The compounds characterized
in this study include SC1982 and SC1475, which were reported in the
previous study as being dependent on Cys84 for binding, but the formed
covalent adducts were not investigated. Cellular and biophysical characterization of these covalently bound
inhibitors was explored, including their three-dimensional structures
when bound to CaS100B (Tables –).

NMR Studies
Backbone resonance assignments were completed
for each SBiX–S100B complex using standard
multidimensional heteronuclear NMR data, and the chemical shift perturbations
in CaS100B (with or without the compound) were evaluated
as described for other S100B inhibitors.,− In general, the SBiX complexes studied here showed
the largest perturbations within a well-defined binding pocket of CaS100B comprising helices 3 and 4 and loop 2 (termed the “hinge”
region). These observations are consistent with the FPCA, which identified
SBiXs that compete with TRTK12 peptide binding.

Chemical
Shift Assignments
Titrations of compound into CaS100B were monitored using 1H–15N HSQC
NMR experiments, as previously described.− Because perturbations
were not always easily tracked during the titration, a series of HNCA,
HNCOCA, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-HNH (HMQC-NOESY-HSQC)
NMR experiments were collected at the end of each titration to unambiguously
assign all the chemical shift values in the compound-bound state.
The reaction products for five small molecules (SC124, SC1475, SC1982,
SBi4172, and SBi4434) bound to CaS100B were assessed by
monitoring perturbations of backbone 1H–15N HSQC correlations after the compounds were added and fully reacted
(Figure  and Figures S1–S5 of the ).

Assigned two-dimensional 1H–15N HSQC
NMR spectra. The binding of five small molecules (SC124, SC1475, SC1982,
SBi4172, and SBi4434) to CaS100B was assessed by monitoring
perturbations of backbone 1H–15N HSQC
NMR experiments. Chemical shift perturbations in NMR spectra for CaS100B in the presence of SBi4172 could not be measured as
the compound caused CaS100B to from soluble aggregates.
The solid horizontal line is plotted at the mean perturbation (in
hertz) plus one standard deviation for each data set.

In the presence of SC124, many of the 1H–15N HSQC correlations of CaS100B were
perturbed,
with the most significant perturbations (≥mean ± SD) occurring
for residues in loop 2 (His42) and helix 4 (Ser78, Thr81, Thr82, Ala83,
Glu86, Phe87, and His90). Likewise, several other residues in loop
2 (Phe43, Leu44, Glu45, and Glu46) and helix 4 (Cys84, His85, and
Glu89) either broadened and/or disappeared upon addition of SC124.

Similarly, residues in loop 2 and helix 4 were perturbed for modifications
via SC1982 (loop 2, His42 and Leu44; helix 4, Ser78, Thr82, Ala83,
Cys84, His85, Glu86, and Glu89) and SBi4434 (loop 2, Ser41, His42,
and Phe43; helix 4, Thr81, Thr82, Ala83, Cys84, His85, and Glu86).
For SC1475, changes in loop 2 (His42 and Lys48), helix 4 (Val80, Thr81,
Thr82, and His85), and helix 1 (Met7) were found in solution. These
data are all consistent with the notion that SC124, SC1475, and SC1982
all react with Cys84 because loop 2 and helix 4 are in the proximity
of each other in the crystallographic structures of CaS100B
and have been previously described to facilitate the binding of small
molecules. For SBi4172, the chemical shift perturbations during the
reaction could not be measured because the compound induced aggregation
of CaS100B (Figure S4 of the ). To further characterize the structural impact
of covalent modifications at Cys84 on CaS100B, we next
determined the structures of the S100B complexes with each compound
by X-ray crystallography.

Covalent
Modifications at Cys84 Affect Target Binding of CaS100B
The structures of CaS100B–inhibitor
complexes (SC124, SC1475, SC1982, SBi4172, and SBi4434) are compared,
each of which was confirmed to have the SBiX molecule
covalently bound to Cys84 of CaS100B (Figure ). In all five of these structural models, each CaS100B subunit consists of four helices (helix 1, E2–G19; helix
2, K28–L40; helix 3, E49–D61; helix 4, D69–F88),
two small antiparallel β-strands, and a Ca2+ ion
bound to both the typical and noncanonical EF-hand calcium binding
domains. Likewise, the typical EF-hand is in the “open”
Ca2+-bound conformation, as is generally found in CaS100B structures, and the dimer
interface is aligned as a symmetric X-type four-helix bundle comprising
helices 1, 1′, 4, and 4′.,−, Comparison of these five structures
to that of CaS100B (PDB entry 1MHO()) with no
drug target reveals a strong conservation of the global fold (Table ); however, deviations in the positions of several
side chains in the target binding site of CaS100B were
observed, as necessary, to accommodate the binding of various SBiX molecules. These include residues in helix 4 and/or loop
4 and in helix 1 (i.e., His15) in some cases, as described below (i.e.,
for the CaS100B–SC124 complex). The specifics of
each structure also provide details of potential synthetic strategies
for engineering a single molecule that occupies all three persistent
“pockets” within the S100B target binding site, so the
individual structures and specific structural changes will be discussed
in some detail.

Chemical modification of Cys84 of CaS100B.
Shown are
schematics that provide an overview of the chemical modification of
Cys84 by compounds (A) SC124, (B) SC1475, (C) SC1982, (D) SBi4172,
and (E) SBi4434.

CaS100B–SC124
The X-ray structure
of a product resulting from mixing SC124 (disulfiram) with Ca2+-bound S100B (CaS100B–SC124) was determined
at 1.58 Å resolution (Figure ). The asymmetric
unit included two CaS100B subunits (chains A and B) forming
the biologically active form of dimeric CaS100B. Residues
Met0–Phe88 and Met0–Glu89 were modeled in chains A and
B, respectively. In the final refined model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.215
and 0.253, respectively), all residues were in the favored (100%)
regions of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers (Table ). Each subunit of CaS100B–SC124
was found to coordinate two calcium ions as is typical of S100 proteins, and electron density was also clearly observed
in the target binding sites for each subunit of CaS100B
as a result of nucleophilic attack of Cys84 by SC124 (Figures  and ). The structure of
the bound product was also consistent with what has been found previously
with other protein adducts involving SC124 (Figure ). Interestingly, though, the Cys84-bound
SC124 adduct has somewhat different positions in each subunit of CaS100B, and this was the first indication that this region,
termed site 2, of CaS100B can accommodate various orientations
for small inhibitors. Curiously, the binding of SC124 causes the side
chain of Glu89 in one subunit to occupy a pocket that can tightly
coordinate a Zn2+ ion,,, and as a result, His15 is reoriented. Note, in Zn2+-bound structures of CaS100B described elsewhere,,, Zn2+ is coordinated
by residues His15, His25, His85, and Glu89.

S100B–SC1475
The X-ray structure of a product
resulting from mixing SC1475 (3,4-dimethoxydalbergione) with Ca2+-bound S100B (CaS100B–SC1475) was determined
at 2.18 Å resolution (Figure ). The asymmetric
unit included two CaS100B subunits (chains X and A) of CaS100B, and in both chains, residues Met0–Glu89 were
modeled into the electron density. In the final refined structure
(Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.213 and 0.251, respectively), all residues were in the
most favored (98.9%) or allowed (1.1%) regions of the Ramachandran
plot with no outliers (see Table ). In each
subunit, two Ca2+ ions, one SC1475 molecule, and 19 waters
were resolved from the calculated electron density of the CaS100B–SC1475 structure. It was also clear that SC1475 covalently
modified CaS100B via nucleophilic substitution of Cys84
into the benzoquinone moiety of the drug. Such a reaction is not uncommon,
has been observed in toxic metabolites of acetaminophen, and results
in the tautomerization of the moiety (Figure ), as previously found. Upon inspection,
no hydrogen bonds were observed from residues of CaS100B
to SC1475, but the small molecule was situated in a hydrophobic pocket
defined by residues in loop 2, termed the “hinge region”
of S100B (Phe43) and helix 4 (Ile80, Ala83, Phe87, and Phe88). Specifically,
the hydroquinone moiety of SC1475 stacks with Phe43, and the alkene
moiety aligns favorably with the aromatic ring of Phe87. His15 is
observed to swing outward from the Zn2+ binding site as
observed in other CaS100B–SBiX structures,
and unlike CaS100B complexes of SBi4172, SC124, and SC1982,
Glu89 does not invade the Zn2+ binding site (vide
infra).

His25, and His85 is also rendered.

CaS100B–SC1982
The X-ray structure
of CaS100B bound to SC1982 (Rubescensin A; CaS100B–SC1982) was determined at 1.65 Å resolution (Figure ). The asymmetric unit contained one CaS100B subunit, and density for Met0–Glu91 could be readily
modeled with the second subunit mapped on the basis of its location
within the crystal symmetry. In the final refined model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.177
and 0.214, respectively), all residues were in the highly favored
(100%) region of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers (Table ). Each subunit of CaS100B–SC1982
was found to coordinate two Ca2+ ions (one in each EF-hand),
and one SC1982 molecule occupied each of the target protein binding
sites via covalent modification (in the region termed site 2). Specifically,
the alkene of SC1982 is reduced via Michael addition from the thiol
of Cys84 from CaS100B (Figure ). After covalent attachment, SC1982 makes two hydrogen
bonds to the backbone carbonyls of loop 2 (His42 and Phe43) and forms
several hydrophobic interactions with residues in the target binding
pocket of CaS100B, including those in loop 2 (Phe43) and
helix 4 (Ile80, Phe87, and Phe88). His15 is once again observed to
move outward from the Zn2+ binding site, and like the structures
of CaS100B–SC124 and CaS100B–SBi4172,
the covalent binding of SC1982 causes the side chain of Glu89 to intrude
into a region of the protein, which can bind Zn2+, and
causes the side chain of His15 to rotate away fairly drastically.

of His42 and Phe43. The neighboring Zn2+ binding site composed
of Glu89, His15, His25, and His85 is also rendered.

Electron density for a highly coordinated atom
that is too dense
to be water was identified. As calcium is prevalent in the system
and because of the identity of the contributors in the coordination
(Asp63, Asp69, and six water molecules), a third calcium ion was modeled
into this density (confirmed by anomalous difference maps).

CaS100B–SBi4172
The X-ray structure
of chelerythrine-bound CaS100B, CaS100B–SBi4172,
was determined at 1.73 Å resolution (Figure ). The asymmetric unit in the drug complex included two S100B
subunits (chains A and B) forming the biologically active dimeric
form of CaS100B. In chain A, residues Met0–Glu89
were modeled into the electron density, and in chain B, only Ser1–Glu89
could be resolved. Each subunit of the CaS100B–SBi4172
complex coordinated two Ca2+ ions; however, only one molecule
of SBi4172 could be observed and was located in the model for chain
B. Sparse density was observed in the analogous binding pocket of
chain A, but it was not sufficiently well defined for accurate modeling
of the SBi4172 inhibitor. A more detailed analysis of chain A showed
that a lack of density in the second subunit likely occurred as a
result of spatial restraints imposed by the crystal packing. In the
final refined model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.230 and 0.268, respectively),
all residues in both subunits were in the favored (98.9%) or allowed
regions (1.1%) of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers (Table ). As clearly defined by the calculated electron
density maps, SBi4172 was found to react with Cys84 via hydration
of a double bond of SBi4172 (Figure ). Once SBi4172 was covalently bound, a dioxole
oxygen atom of SBi4172 was found to make water-bridged interactions
with the backbone carbonyl of Phe43. Otherwise, SBi4172 was situated
in a hydrophobic pocket composed of side chains within loop 2 (Phe43),
helix 4 (Ile80, Ala83, Phe87, and Phe88), and helix 1′ (Val7,
Val8, and Ile11). Like the earlier inhibitor-bound CaS100B
complexes, the side chain moiety of His15 was found to move out of
the established Zn2+ binding site of CaS100B.

colored yellow. SBi4172 is found within persistent binding site 2.

CaS100B–SBi4434
The X-ray structure
of SBi4434 {2,3-bis[(2-hydroxyethyl)thio]-1,4-naphthoquinone} bound
to CaS100B (CaS100B–SBi4434) was determined
at 1.08 Å resolution (Figure ). The asymmetric
unit included two S100B subunits (chains A and X) forming the biologically
active dimeric form of S100B. In chain A, residues Met0–Glu91were
modeled while only residues Met0–Phe88 of chain X could be
resolved. Each subunit in the CaS100B–SBi4434 structure
bound two calcium ions and a SBi4434 molecule. In the final refined
model (Rcrys and Rfree values of 0.192 and 0.211, respectively), all residues
were in the favored (99.4%) or allowed regions (0.6%) of the Ramachandran
plot with no outliers (Table ). Sole among the structures described here, the high resolution
of the diffraction data produced by the CaS100B–SBi4434
crystal allowed for the inclusion of riding hydrogen atoms in this
particular model. As clearly defined by the calculated electron density
maps, SBi4434 covalently modifies CaS100B at Cys84. As
seen, the thiol of Cys84 substitutes for one of the thioglycol moieties
of SBi4434 (Figure ). The second thioglycol
moiety is allowed much conformational flexibility as evidenced by
the sparse electron density for these atoms as well as the alternative
conformations of the moiety modeled in the two inhibitor molecules.
The compound does not make any hydrogen bonds with the protein but
is nestled in a hydrophobic pocket formed by loop 2 and helix 4 with
the aromatic rings of SBi4434 stacked between the side chains of Phe43
and Phe87. In this model, His85 swings out of the Zn2+ binding
site.

Cell-Based Assay
To determine whether
covalent modification
of Cys84 affects cell proliferation in malignant melanoma, its effect
on the growth of WM115 malignant melanoma cells, which express elevated
levels of the S100B protein, was measured as described previously. Briefly, proliferation of WM115 cells stably
transfected with either shRNAscrambled (i.e., high S100B)
or shRNAS100B (i.e., low S100B) was evaluated in triplicate
following a 4 day incubation in the absence or presence of each compound
at varying concentrations (Table ). For each
titration, knockdown of the S100B protein was confirmed by Western
blot analysis (3-fold decrease; n = 4) (Figure ), and EC50 values were determined using
the average of three or more titrations. With SC1475 as an exception
(ratio of 1.00), it was found that lower concentrations of SC124,
SC1982, and SBi4172 were needed to inhibit cell growth with the shRNAscrambled versus the shRNAS100B knockdown WM115
cells (1.50 &lt; ratio &lt; 3.57). This is consistent with the compounds
having specificity toward S100B-containing cells; however, only titrations
with SC1982 were shown to be S100B-selective (1.77-fold) with a statistically
significant t-test (p = 0.001; n = 8). Consistent with this result, p53 levels were 2-fold
higher (n = 4) in the presence than in the absence
of SC1982 (in Figure , compare lanes 1 and
3 and lanes 2 and 4, respectively). This result along with an observation
of S100B expression-dependent growth inhibition suggests that SC1982
displays an on-target effect of S100B inhibition with subsequent p53
restoration. The last compound, SBi4434, showed fluorescence interference
with the SYBR Green dye, so it was excluded from further evaluation.

blot analysis. The control without drug was treated with
the same DMSO concentration (0.01%). The addition of SC1982 did not
affect the protein levels of S100B in the shRNAscrambled or shRNAS100B cell lines. However, both shRNAscrambled and shRNAS100B cell lines had a measurable gain in total
p53 protein levels in the presence of SC1982. This result along with
an observation of S100B expression-dependent growth inhibition suggests
that SC1982 displays an on-target effect of S100B inhibition with
subsequent p53 restoration.

Discussion
Malignant melanoma is the fifth and seventh
most common cancer
among men and women, respectively, so
the discovery of novel therapeutics for its treatment remains a high
priority. Elevated S100B is a prognostic indicator for assessing disease
progression, disease recurrence, and metastatic potential in patients
with MM.− It is also established that S100B not only is a clinical marker
but also binds to and negatively regulates p53 at the protein level., While the p53 tumor suppressor protein is mutated in many human
cancers, it is typically wild-type (wt,
&gt;90%) in MM,, so restoring p53 protein by inhibiting
S100B represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating MM. While
low-molecular weight compounds that block the p53 binding site on
S100B and inhibit formation of the S100B–p53 complex exist,
improving their affinity, efficacy, and specificity remains a priority.
Thus, S100B represents a new cancer target, and improved SBiXs should provide novel therapeutic(s) for treating MM by
restoring active p53 protein.

Structure–function
characterizations of five novel inhibitors
of the CaS100B–p53 interaction are presented here.
Of the five compounds, SC1982 has the most significant hydrogen bonding
network within the CaS100B binding pocket, and interestingly,
it demonstrated the highest level of target specific activity in the
WM115 cellular assay. Note that despite the relatively low EC50 of SC124, expectations should be tempered when considering
this compound. SC124 is small with a scaffold lacking complexity.
It forms no hydrogen bonds with the target protein and lacks even
a consistent binding pose within the two monomers of S100B. These
details leave little potential for SC124 as a therapeutic that would
not be sequestered elsewhere within the cell, and unsurprisingly,
it lacks statistically significant S100B expression-dependent growth
inhibition.

Such target specific effects are important when
considering the
relationship between off-target effects and toxicity. This is particularly
important when considering the therapeutic application of covalent
modifiers because their off-target effects are not uncommon and are
often severe. One successful example of a drug linked to the protein
via Michael addition is Afatinib, which is used in the treatment of
metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)., The target specific effect of SC1982 (Figure  and Table ) is reassuring and warrants further
investigation as a chemical scaffold for engineering novel SBiX molecules. In fact, SC1982 and each compound presented
here offer a new chemical scaffold for continued SAR studies for improving
affinity and specificity.

These structures can be used for guiding
the design of new inhibitors
using multiple approaches. The most straightforward of these is via
“tethering” new functional moieties onto the existing
covalently bound compound(s) and keeping the covalent bond in place. A second strategy is to develop quickly reversible
covalent modifications, as described previously, for the inclusion of an α-cyanoacrylamide functionality.
This modification increases the intrinsic reactivity of an olefin
and eliminates the formation of irreversible adducts. Such an approach
could enhance the bioavailability and selectivity of the inhibitory
compound. For Cys84 of CaS100B, such a cyanoacrylamide
(or cyanoacrylate) would react with cysteine thiols under physiological
conditions in an energetically favorable manner and become rapidly
reversible, including having off rates on the subsecond to second
time scales. In this situation, the level
of off-site targeting is significantly reduced, and the covalent nature
of the adduct for the target of interest is long-lived, as needed
for therapeutic efficacy.

A third approach to obtaining high-affinity,
high-specificity S100B
inhibitors with these data is to engineer compounds that make use
of all three persistent pockets in the p53 binding site. In this regard,
the inhibitors presented here are particularly important because they
are located within the persistent binding pocket termed “site
2”. Therefore, regardless of whether these inhibitors are covalently
bound, they provide exquisite detail for how to connect chemical moieties
in sites 1 and 3. Therefore, the inhibitors presented here can be
considered in combination with chemical functionalities described
in previous structural studies of other SBiXs− to produce a ligand capable of binding all three persistent binding
sites simultaneously. The simultaneous occupation of sites 1 and 2
will be of interest first because “site 3” binders within CaS100B have been thoroughly described elsewhere.

Although
the mechanisms involved in adduct formation may differ
between compounds, SC124, SC1475, SC1982, SBi4172, and SBi4434 (as
well as for SC0844 and SC322 studied
previously), together these compounds comprise a subset of S100B inhibitors
that impact the conformational state of CaS100B in a similar
manner. In particular, an adduct added to Cys84 clashes with side
chains on helix 4 and thereby rotates a Zn2+ binding residue,
Glu89, into a new location. As a result, residues comprising the Zn2+ binding site (His15, His25, His85, and Glu89) are subsequently
reordered. Although the particulars of this effect on the Zn2+ binding site may be unique to an individual compound and may or
may not have an effect on S100B activities, the covalent modifier
family of SBiXs described here is “hallmarked”
by this common structural perturbation (Figure ). Table  lists the effect through measurements
of directional movements of atoms and torsions of residue side chains.
The most disruptive feature of this conformational change is an intrusion
of Glu89 into the Zn2+ site with a subsequent exit of one
of the localized histidine side chains. Further investigation may
prove this to be a meaningful observation because the oxidation of
Cys84 has functional implications with regard to the regulation of
S100B by redox. The inhibitory properties
of these compounds may in part be attributed to the manipulation of
this natural regulatory Zn2+ binding feature of S100B and
are very likely functionally important.

Distortion of the zinc
binding site is a hallmark of the S100B
covalent inhibitor family. Shown are ribbon diagrams of CaS100B in the presence (yellow) and absence (gray) of a covalent modifier
(SC1982) with residues and ligands of interest shown as sticks. The
covalent modifier family of SBiXs is hallmarked by
perturbation in the conformational state of the residues forming the
Zn2+ binding site (His15, His25, His85, and Glu89). Commonly,
Glu89 is seen intruding on the Zn2+ with a subsequent displacement
of a histidine side chain.

Although we have demonstrated a restoration in p53 levels
alongside
the inhibition of S100B, it must be noted that within WM115 malignant
melanoma cells, S100B has been associated with factors other than
p53. For instance, S100B was found to enhance cell viability and modulate
MAPK signaling by binding directly to the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase
(RSK). The formation of this complex blocks ERK-dependent phosphorylation
of RSK and sequesters RSK into the cytosol, preventing it from acting
on nuclear targets. Thus, S100B has been shown to increase the level
of cell survival in malignant melanoma by contributing to abnormal
ERK/RSK signaling.Also, a target of S100B
is the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is
upregulated in late metastatic stages of samples from melanoma patients.
The overexpression of RAGE is associated with mesenchymal-like morphologies
in WM115 cells and results in greater migration abilities and reduced
proliferation properties. This supports a role of RAGE in the metastatic
switch of melanoma cells. Interestingly, overexpression of RAGE results
in the increased level of expression of S100B and lower levels of
p53, ERK1/2, cyclin E, and NF-κB.
