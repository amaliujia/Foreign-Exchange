A locked nucleic acid (LNA)
is a useful chemical modification.− Mixed oligonucleotides consisting of LNA, DNA, and RNA residues
have improved polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments,() single-nucleotide polymorphism assays,, RNA interference,, antisense mRNA technology,() microRNA profiling and regulation,, aptamers,() LNAzymes,() microarrays,() and nanomaterials.() These applications require that LNA oligonucleotides
possess specific melting temperatures (Tm) and free energies of association for complementary sequences (ΔG°).()

The thermodynamic
stability of nucleic acid duplexes has been described with the nearest-neighbor
model, which takes into account energetics of nearest-neighbor base
pairs and assumes that interactions beyond neighboring nucleotides
can be neglected.− The total enthalpy and entropy of duplex annealing are calculated
by summation of doublet termswhere Nbp is the number of duplex base pairs. The first term on the
right side of eq  is the sum over all internal
nearest-neighbor doublets (ΔH°i,i+1). The second term (ΔH°init) represents
the “initiation” enthalpy, which includes the formation
of the duplex first base pair, corrections for the extra hydrogen
bond of G·C versus A·T in terminal base pairs,() and terminal base–solvent interactions.
The initiation parameter varies with the nature of terminal base pairs., Equation  also includes an entropic symmetry
correction (ΔS°symmetry) of −1.4 cal mol–1 K–1, which is added when a duplex consists of
two identical, self-complementary oligonucleotides.

The nearest-neighbor
model accurately predicts thermodynamics and melting temperatures
(±1.5 °C) of native oligonucleotides.− It appears that the nearest-neighbor model also predicts
well single-base mismatches, and some chemical modifications,
including single LNAs.− Because LNAs increase duplex stability and change the specificity
of base pairing,, LNA nearest-neighbor parameters
differ significantly from DNA parameters.

The LNA parameter
set is incomplete and does not cover many useful sequences. Thermodynamic
parameters have been published for isolated LNA·RNA base
pairs introduced into 2′-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotides, and for isolated LNA·DNA base pairs.() However, many applications benefit from other types of LNA modifications.
For example, a triplet of LNA residues appears to maximize mismatch
discrimination and improves single-nucleotide polymorphism assays.() Fully LNA-modified probes can selectively capture
genomic DNA sequences.() To determine the
parameters for consecutive LNAs, we measured the stability of duplexes
using the fluorescence melting method.() The energetics of LNA effects was determined from the difference
between LNA-modified and native (core) duplexes. Because we used standard
experimental conditions (1 M Na+ and pH 7), new parameters
are compatible with existing DNA parameters.

Materials and Methods
Oligonucleotides were synthesized
at Integrated DNA Technologies, purified by HPLC,() and dialyzed against storage buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl and
0.1
mM Na2EDTA (pH 7.5)].() Concentrated
oligonucleotide samples were tested by mass spectroscopy (molecular
weights were within 2 g/mol) and capillary electrophoresis (&gt;90%
pure). DNA concentrations were determined from predicted extinction
coefficients (ε) and sample absorbance at 260 nm using the Beer–Lambert
law., LNA nucleotides were assumed to possess
the same extinction coefficients as DNA ones. Coefficients of Texas
Red (14400 L mol–1 cm–1) or Iowa
Black RQ (44510 L mol–1 cm–1)
were added to the ε of labeled oligonucleotides.

Primary Set of Oligonucleotides
Figure A shows the sequences studied. Fluorescent Texas Red dye (TXRD)
is attached at the 5′ end of the top strand, and Iowa Black
RQ quencher (IBRQ) is attached at 3′ end of the complementary
strand. This design efficiently quenches fluorescence when the strands
are annealed because the dye and the quencher are in close contact.
We use notation of oligonucleotide manufacturers; LNA nucleotides
are indicated with + in front of the base symbol (e.g., +A denotes
an adenine LNA nucleotide). Cytosine of +C is 5-methylated because
oligonucleotide manufacturers usually synthesize the methylated version
of LNA cytosine.

(A) Eight sets of sequences were studied. Various matched
and mismatched LNA·DNA base pairs were introduced at the “X·Y”
site (X and Y can be A, C, G, T, +A, +C, +G, or +T). (B) Example of
analysis. Thermodynamic effects of LNA nucleotides (+N) were determined
from the stability differences between LNA-modified duplexes and core
DNA sequences.

The set of DNA duplexes contains a triplet of consecutive
LNAs located either in the interior of the strand labeled with Texas
Red or in the interior of the complementary strand labeled with Iowa
Black RQ. Eight possible LNA·DNA base pairs (X·Y ≡
+A·T, A·+T, +T·A, T·+A, +C·G, C·+G,
+G·C, and G·+C), and 24 mismatches were introduced at the
X·Y site. Core duplexes were also measured. They contained DNA·DNA base pairs
(X·Y ≡ A·T, T·A, C·G, and G·C), and
the same terminal Texas Red–Iowa Black RQ pair was also measured.
This design is economical; each oligonucleotide is used in several
duplexes. Thirty-six duplexes were melted for each set except for
set 3. This set consisted of 27 duplexes because its two sequences,
GTAGGGGTGCT-IBRQ and GTA+G+G+GGTGCT-IBRQ, were not obtained with sufficient
purity.

For sets 1–4, the same base flanks the X·Y
site on the 5′ and 3′ sides. For sets 5–8, the
flanking bases are different and each of the four bases (A, T, C,
and G) occurs once on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the X·Y
base pairs. This design ensures that every possible nearest-neighbor
interaction is present several times within the data set.

Figure A also shows that duplex lengths range from 10 to
12 bp. Such short sequences are likely to melt in a two-state manner.
Nevertheless, non-two-state behavior may occur even for short oligonucleotides
if they form stable self-complementary structures, e.g., hairpins
or dimers. OligoAnalyzer version 3.1 (http://www.idtdna.com/analyzer/Applications/OligoAnalyzer/) confirmed that our sequences do not form such structures.

This paper follows previous conventions to represent duplex sequences.() A slash divides the strands in an antiparallel
orientation. The sequence is oriented 5′ to 3′ before
the slash and 3′ to 5′ after the slash (for example,
CA/GT represents the 5′-CA-3′/3′-GT-5′
doublet with two Watson–Crick base pairs). Mismatched nucleotides
are underlined or colored red. Ribonucleotides are distinguished from
deoxyribonucleotides by the “r” prefix, e.g., rA.

Melting Experiments
We followed our previously described
method for fluorescence melting experiments.() The melting buffer contained 1 M NaCl, 3.87 mM NaH2PO4, 6.13 mM Na2HPO4, and 1 mM Na2EDTA and was adjusted to pH 7.0 with 1 M NaOH.() Buffer reagents of p.a. grade purity were bought from ThermoFisher
Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA).

Melting experiments were performed
at 13 different total single-strand concentrations (19, 30, 46, 70,
110, 160, 250, 375, 570, and 870 nM and 1.3, 2.0, and 3.0 μM).
Duplex samples were prepared at the highest Ct of 3 μM. Complementary oligonucleotides were mixed
in a 1:1 ratio in the melting buffer, heated to 95 °C, and slowly
cooled to room temperature. Aliquots of the 3 μM solution were
diluted with the melting buffer to make 12 remaining samples. Low-binding
Costar microcentrifuge tubes (catalog no. 3207, Corning, Wilkes Barre,
PA) were used to reduce the level of binding of oligonucleotides to
the tube surface.

We pipetted 25 μL of the melting sample
into two wells of a 96-well PCR plate (Extreme Uniform Thin Wall Plates,
catalog no. B70501, BIOplastics BV, Landgraaf, The Netherlands). A
significant discrepancy between wells alerted us to an erroneous measurement.
Using the Bio-Rad iQ5 real-time PCR system, the fluorescence signal
in the Texas Red channel was recorded every 0.2 °C while the
temperature was increased from 4 to 98 °C and decreased back
to 4 °C over two cycles. Subsequent temperature cycles were not
used because they were unreliable; Tm sometimes
increased, indicating the evaporation of water or degradation of dye.
The iQ5 system maintained a temperature rate of 25 °C/h. Analysis
was conducted in Microsoft Excel. We programmed VBA software to automate
melting profile analysis, including baseline selection using a second-derivative
algorithm.() The fraction θ was calculated
[θ = (F – FL)/(FU – FL)] from the fluorescence of the DNA sample (F), the fluorescence of the upper linear baseline (FU), and the fluorescence of the lower linear baseline
(FL). If a duplex melts in a two-state
manner, dissociation of the fluorophore from the quencher is likely
coupled to the duplex-to-single strand melting transition and θ
represents the fraction of melted duplexes.

The melting temperature
was defined as the temperature at which θ = 1/2. The average standard deviation of Tm values was 0.4 °C. Transition enthalpies, entropies,
and free energies were determined from fits to individual melting
profiles and from the dependence of melting temperature on DNA concentration.,,, These two analytical methods assume that melting transitions proceed
in a two-state manner; that is, intact duplex and unhybridized single
strands are dominant, and partially melted duplexes are negligible
throughout the melting transition. The methods also assume that transition
enthalpies and entropies are temperature-independent. If ΔH° or ΔS° values differed
more than 15% between these two methods, the duplex did not melt in
a two-state manner.,, In that case, we excluded ΔH° or ΔS° values from further analysis because they were inaccurate.

Stabilizing Effects of LNA Modifications
Locked nucleic
acids increase duplex stability and alter the melting transition enthalpy,
entropy, and free energy. As shown in Figure B, we determined these LNA contributions (ΔΔH°, ΔΔS°, and ΔΔG°37) from the difference between LNA-modified
and core duplexes.() LNA modifications
were located at least five nucleotides from the terminal fluorophore
and the quencher. In this design, terminal labels do not interact
with LNAs and do not influence differential thermodynamic values between
modified and core duplexes.

Figure B
shows an example of the analysis for the Set1–11 duplex. Entering
ΔH° from Table S1 of the , we determined the experimentally measured
differential enthalpic change [ΔΔH°(A+T+G+TC/TACAG)]
to be −97.6 – (−86.4) = −11.2 kcal/mol.
In the nearest-neighbor model, this enthalpic contribution is a sum
of enthalpies of base pair doubletsRearrangement of eq  places unknown LNA parameters on the left sideThe right side of eq  contains the experimentally measured enthalpic change and two previously
determined nearest-neighbor parameters.() McTigue, Peterson, and Kahn investigated the thermodynamics of interactions
between LNA·DNA and DNA·DNA base pairs. We used their parameters
to account for LNA–DNA interactions that occur in the beginning
and at the end of a section of consecutive LNAs. Parameters from their
32NN set (Table 4 of ref ()) were entered into eq A similar equation was constructed for each
LNA duplex. Analogous equations were set up for ΔΔS° and ΔΔG°37 contributions.

Determination of LNA Nearest-Neighbor Parameters
Selecting
two bases from the set of four (A, T, C, and G) with replacement leads
to the creation of 16 nearest-neighbor doublets.() Because antiparallel strands of native DNA duplexes exhibit
structural symmetry, some doublet sequences are identical, e.g., AC/TG
and GT/CA. Therefore, 10 nearest-neighbor parameters are sufficient
to represent internal DNA·DNA doublets. No such symmetry exists
for LNA·DNA base pairs. The +A+C/TG doublet differs from the
+G+T/CA doublet. Sixteen nearest-neighbor parameters are needed for
consecutive LNA·DNA base pairs.

We measured 62 perfectly
matched LNA duplexes. Sixty of them melted in a two-state manner.
Their thermodynamic values were used to determine the parameters.
Each of the 16 LNA doublets was well represented in this data set
with the following numbers of occurrences: 8 +A+A/TT, 8 +A+C/TG, 8
+A+G/TC, 8 +A+T/TA, 8 +C+A/GT, 6 +C+C/GG, 7 +C+G/GC, 8 +C+T/GA, 8
+G+A/CT, 7 +G+C/CG, 4 +G+G/CC, 8 +G+T/CA, 8 +T+A/AT, 8 +T+C/AG, 8
+T+G/AC, and 8 +T+T/AA.

First, we examined enthalpic effects.
Equation  was constructed for each LNA duplex.
This thermodynamic
analysis produced the set of 60 linear equationswhere M is a 60 × 16 matrix
of the number of occurrences for each LNA nearest-neighbor doublet
in 60 duplexes, Hn–n is the vector
of 16 unknown parameters, and Hexp is the
column vector of experimentally measured enthalpic contributions.
The parameters reported by McTique et al. were subtracted from the
enthalpic contributions as shown in eqs  and . Because the number of unknown parameters (16) was less than the number of equations (60), eq  was overdetermined.()We solved it using singular-value decomposition
(SVD)() by minimizing χ2 where σH is
the diagonal matrix whose elements are experimental errors of ΔΔH°. Because these errors were similar, they were set
to a constant value of 3 kcal/mol and the SVD fit was not error weighted.
Singular-value decomposition was conducted using Microsoft Excel Add-in,
Matrix.xla package, version 2.3.2 (Foxes Team, L. Volpi, http://digilander.libero.it/foxes). Calculations were repeated using the Excel LINEST function, yielding
the same values. We also examined matrix M for degeneracies.
The rank of matrix M was 16. Because the rank was equal
to the number of unknown parameters, the matrix had no singular values,
and the parameters were unique and linearly independent.−

Next, we replaced ΔΔH° values
with ΔΔS° or ΔΔG°37 values in eqs –. Analogous analyses gave us nearest-neighbor
parameters for entropies and free energies.

Error Analysis
Error estimates of parameters were obtained
from bootstrap simulations.() These calculations
estimate the dependence of parameter values on the data set. Many
bootstrap data sets were created from the original data set. A different
value of the parameter was usually determined from each bootstrap
data
set. The bootstrap estimate of the parameter error is given by the
standard deviation of all these parameter values.

In our simulations,
the bootstrap data sets were the same size as the original data set;
i.e., the sets contained data from 60 duplexes. The duplex data were
randomly drawn, with replacement, from the original data set. This
means that the entire experimental data set was used in each drawing.
This procedure produced bootstrap data sets in which some duplex data
from the original data sets were present multiple times and other
data were not selected. We generated 5 × 104 bootstrap
data
sets. Equation  was solved for each data set
using SVD, and 16 parameters for the consecutive LNAs were determined.
If the rank of M was less than 16, the particular bootstrap
data
set did not contain all possible nearest-neighbor doublet sequences.
Thermodynamic parameters could not be determined in this case; therefore,
the bootstrap set was excluded from analysis, and a replacement data
set was drawn. Fewer than 3% of the data sets were excluded. Standard
deviations and averages were calculated from bootstrap parameter estimates.
The average parameters determined from bootstrap analysis agreed with
the parameters determined from the original data set.

We have
analyzed the error in free energy calculated from entropic and enthalpic
contributions (ΔΔG° = ΔΔH° – TΔΔS°). Enthalpies and entropies of DNA melting transitions
are correlated.() The errors of the enthalpic
contribution, σ(ΔΔH°), and
the entropic contribution, σ(ΔΔS°), are also highly correlated; their correlation coefficient
is usually above 0.99., If the uncertainty in ΔΔG° is estimated by error propagation,() the covariance cov(ΔΔH°,ΔΔS°) significantly decreases the errorEquation  indicates
that the free energy is determined more precisely than the enthalpic
or entropic contributions alone. The similar error compensation decreases
the error in the melting temperature calculated from ΔH° and ΔS°.() This analysis demonstrates that it is useful to report
the ΔΔH° and ΔΔS° parameters in Tables – beyond their individual errors. If the parameters
are rounded to their error estimates, the calculated free energies
and melting temperatures may be less precise.

Validation Melting Experiments
Validation sets were
measured by ultraviolet spectroscopy as previously described.() Absorbance at 268 nm was recorded every 0.1
°C using a Beckman DU 650 spectrophotometer. The temperature
was changed at a rate of 25 °C/h in the range from 10 to 98 °C
using a high-performance temperature controller (Beckman-Coulter,
Brea, CA). Both heating and cooling melting profiles were collected.
Sloping baselines were subtracted from the melting profiles,() and the melting temperature was defined as the
temperature at which the fraction of melted duplexes equaled 0.5.

Nearest-Neighbor Parameters for Single-Base Mismatches
There are 12 possible LNA·DNA mismatches (+A·A, +C·C, +G·G, +T·T, +A·C, +C·A, +A·G, +G·A, +C·T, +T·C, +G·T, and +T·G). In our design, mismatches
were located in the center of LNA triplets. Enthalpic, entropic, and
free energy effects were determined from the differences between the
energetics of LNA mismatch duplexes and core DNA duplexes.

As
an example, let us consider the Set1–17 duplex containing the +G·G mismatch. The enthalpic contribution from the
A+T+G+TC/TAGAG duplex
subsequence is calculated from the difference in the total enthalpy
of the Set1–17 (TXRD-CGTCA+T+G+TCGC)
and Set1–10 (TXRD-CGTCATGTCGC) duplexes (Table S1 of the )The nearest-neighbor model assumes that this
contribution is the sum of four nearest-neighbor doublets. We used
the parameters of McTigue et al.() for
two doublets (A+T/TA and +TC/AG). An equation similar to eq  was constructed. The left side contains two unknown
parameters

Equation  was
built for each mismatched duplex. Sequences having the +G·G mismatch were grouped into the subset. The
resulting system of linear equations was overdetermined and was solved
by SVD analysis. Eight unknown nearest-neighbor parameters (+A+X/TY, +C+X/GY, +G+X/CY, +T+X/AY, +X+A/YT, +X+C/YG, +X+G/YC, and +X+T/YA) were obtained (+X ≡
+G, and Y ≡ G). This procedure was repeated
for 12 +X·Y mismatch types, and 96 parameters
(8
× 12) were determined. The thermodynamic values of LNA duplexes
containing mismatches can be predicted from eqs  and  using new parameters.

SVD analysis
indicated that the number of linearly independent equations and the
rank of matrix M was seven for mismatches. Eight fitted
nearest-neighbor parameters are useful, but they are not a unique
solution,, because a
constraint equation relates the numbers of eight doublets (N)The constraint decreases the number of unique
parameters to seven for each mismatch type. Equation  is valid for duplexes containing mismatches within consecutive
LNAs.

Unique, linearly independent parameters can be constructed
from linear combinations of eight nonunique parameters. The similar
constraint limits the number of unique parameters for some DNA mismatches.
Allawi and SantaLucia proposed seven linearly independent sequences
for DNA mismatches.() They added a C·G
base pair to nonunique doublets to create linearly independent triplets.
Using a similar procedure, we have added the +C·G base pair to
LNA doublets and created seven unique triplets (+A+X+C/TYG, +C+X+C/GYG, +G+X+A/CYT, +G+X+C/CYG, +G+X+G/CYC, +G+X+T/CYA, and +T+X+C/AYG). A single LNA mismatch lies in the center. Using
SVD analysis, seven parameters for those triplets were determined
for each +X·Y mismatch type (Table S3
of the ).

The
energetics of any LNA +X·Y mismatch sequence
(+K+X+M/LYN) could also
be calculated from unique triplet parametersThe +K·L and +M·N pairs are Watson–Crick
base pairs adjacent to the mismatch. The numbers of seven triplets, N(triplet), are related to the numbers of doublets: N(+A+X+C/TYG) = N(+A+X/TY), N(+C+X+C/GYG) = N(+C+X/GY), N(+G+X+A/CYT) = N(+X+A/YT), N(+G+X+C/CYG) = N(+G+X/CY) – N(+X+A/YT) – N(+X+G/YC) – N(+X+T/YA), N(+G+X+G/CYC) = N(+X+G/YC), N(+G+X+T/CYA) = N(+X+T/YA), and N(+T+X+C/AYG) = N(+T+X/AY). The doublet and triplet
parameter sets predict identical thermodynamic values for any LNA
mismatch sequence. Both parameter sets are implementations of the
same nearest-neighbor model and do not take into account any next-nearest-neighbor
or longer interactions.

Results
Nearest-Neighbor Parameters for Consecutive LNAs
Thermodynamic
values were measured for the primary oligonucleotide set using fluorescence.() The melting process was monitored using Texas
Red dye and Iowa Black RQ quencher, which were attached at the termini
of duplexes. These labels appear to be optimal for melting experiments,
as other fluorophores (FAM, HEX, and TET) do not provide reliable
thermodynamic values and may ruin the two-state nature of melting
transitions.()

Fluorescence versus
temperature plots
always exhibited single, S-shaped transitions that were reversible.
Figure  presents examples of averaged melting
profiles. Pictured duplexes have a TXRD-CGTCA+T+A+TCGC base sequence. The DNA matched duplex (dashed line) is more
stable than the LNA duplex containing the +A·A mismatch (dotted line) in Figure . This
stability order is sequence-dependent and not universally observed.
If LNAs cause large duplex stabilization and a single mismatch destabilizes
a duplex less, the mismatched LNA duplex will be more stable than
the matched DNA duplex of the same base sequence. This occurs often
for +G·T, +T·G, +G·G, and +G·A mismatches.

Average fluorescence melting profiles of LNA and core
DNA duplexes. The DNA duplex of Set1–01 (TXRD-CGTCATATCGC)
is shown (−–−). The first isosequential LNA duplex
(Set1–02, TXRD-CGTCA+T+A+TCGC) is perfectly matched (—).
The second LNA duplex (Set1–13, TXRD-CGTCA+T+A+TCGC) contains the +A·A mismatch (···).
Melting experiments were conducted in 1 M Na+ buffer, and Ct was 375 nM.

Thermodynamic values were extracted from melting
profiles. First, the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy were estimated
from fits to individual melting profiles.() We fitted only data within the transition where fraction θ
ranged from 0.15 to 0.85. Second, ΔH°,
ΔS°, and ΔG°37 were determined from graphs of 1/Tm versus ln Ct/4. These graphs
were linear over a 150-fold range of 13 DNA concentrations (Figure
S1 of the ). When
the 1/Tm data point deviated from the
fitted straight line by a value more than twice the value of the propagated
error, it was removed from the fit as an outlier. Fewer than 1% of
all graph points were excluded. Melting temperatures and thermodynamic
values for the primary data set are presented in Table S1 of the . The enthalpy, entropy,
and free energy are negative because they are reported for the annealing
reaction, which is customary practice.

Our thermodynamic analysis
assumed a two-state nature of melting transitions. When this assumption
is valid, both 1/Tm versus ln Ct/4 plots and fits to melting profiles yield
the same results. If thermodynamic values differed more than 15% between
these two methods, the specific duplex did not melt in a two-state
fashion, and its thermodynamic data were removed from further analysis,
averages, and fitting of nearest-neighbor parameters. For the primary
data
set, average differences between both methods in ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG°37 values were 7.2, 8.3, and 2.5%, respectively.

Duplexes exhibiting deviations from the two-state melting behavior
are listed in Table S1 of the . The non-two-state melting transitions may occur when the cooperativity
of the melting process is low and the duplex melts in several stages.
The oligonucleotides can also fold into alternative stable structures,
broadening the melting transition or splitting it into two S-shaped
transitions. We did not observe the second transition in any melting
profile. Duplexes also have a terminal dye–quencher pair that
can interact with neighboring base pairs; this could change duplex
melting behavior and local base pair cooperativity. Because fluorescence
depends on dye–quencher distance and orientation, the fluorescent
signal is more sensitive to non-two-state behavior than the UV absorbance
signal. If dissociation of the dye from the quencher does not coincide
with duplex melting, discrepancies in thermodynamic analysis are likely
to occur and thermodynamic values could be inaccurate.

The majority
of duplexes in the data set (&gt;93%) exhibited two-state melting
transitions, and the average ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG°37 values of those duplexes were used to determine nearest-neighbor
parameters. Table  shows the nearest-neighbor parameters for consecutive LNAs. Standard
errors were estimated from bootstrap analysis. The free energy values
calculated from the Gibbs thermodynamic relation (ΔΔG°37 = ΔΔH°
–
310.15ΔΔS°) agreed within 0.09 kcal/mol
with the ΔΔG°37 values
determined from SVD analysis. This agreement confirms the consistency
of our method.

Entropic contribution to the Gibbs free energy at 37
°C.

Because ΔΔG°37 is negative for all nearest-neighbor doublets in Table , consecutive LNAs always stabilize a DNA duplex
and the effect is sequence-independent. The most stabilizing doublets
are +C+C/GG (ΔΔG°37 =
−2.3
kcal/mol) and +G+G/CC (ΔΔG°37 = −2.0 kcal/mol). The smallest LNA impact is seen
for the +A+A/TT (−0.6 kcal/mol) and +T+T/AA (−0.8 kcal/mol)
sequences. Effects of LNAs on ΔΔG°37 are approximately proportional to the duplex fraction of
G·C base pairs. Introduction of LNAs stabilizes cytosine-guanine
base pairs ∼0.9 kcal/mol more than adenine-thymine base pairs.
The ΔΔS° values vary widely from
−23.5
to 0.7 cal mol–1 K–1.

Software Implementation of New Parameters
Thermodynamic
parameters in Table  are differential thermodynamic
parameters; i.e., they represent deviations from native DNA duplexes.
To calculate the total enthalpy for any LNA-modified sequence, one
predicts the transition enthalpy for the native DNA duplex (ΔH°) according to eq  and adds
the differential parameters (ΔΔH°)
to take into account LNA effectsBoth sums of eq  contain the same doublet sequences; the difference is in
LNA modification (CA/GT vs +C+A/GT). Parameters for the same base
sequences could be combined. Addition of differential LNA parameters
(ΔΔH°) and DNA nearest-neighbor
parameters() gives full nearest-neighbor

Calculated from
the 32NN set of ref ().

As an example, we present calculations for the perfectly
matched 5′-TA+C+AGG-3′ duplex.The first and last parameters represent initiation
interactions using the concept of a fictitious end base (E).,, Transition entropies and free
energies can also be casted into full parameters using analogous relationships.

Accuracy of Thermodynamic Parameters for Consecutive LNAs
To verify the analysis and applicability of the nearest-neighbor
model, we used new parameters to predict thermodynamics of the primary
data
set. New LNA parameters accurately predicted ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG° values for these short duplexes. The average relative errors
were 3.3, 3.5, and 2.9%, respectively. This is comparable to the accuracy
reported for nearest-neighbor parameters of native nucleic acids where
standard deviations of thermodynamic values ranged from 3 to 8%.()

To estimate the robustness of the new
parameters, it is important to test their performance with an independent
validation set of duplex oligomers that were not used to derive the
parameters. We have measured 53 additional LNA-modified duplexes.
The oligonucleotides did not have any fluorescent labels or quenchers
attached. Their melting transitions were followed using UV spectroscopy.() These LNA duplexes ranged from 8 to 10 bp in
lengths, from 10 to 88% in G·C content, and from 20 to 60% in
LNA content. Figure  presents a comparison
of experimentally measured melting temperatures with predictions.
Good agreement is observed. Additional details are listed in Table
S2 of the . The new
parameters in Table  result in an average Tm prediction error of 2.1 °C (χ2 = 2549).

Comparison of predicted and experimentally measured melting
temperatures for the validation set of 53 chimeric LNA·DNA duplexes
in 1 M Na+. We have predicted melting temperatures from
parameters listed in Table  (○) and
using the Exiqon Tm prediction 1.1 tool (http://lna-tm.com) (⊞).

Exiqon also developed a thermodynamic model of
locked nucleic acids.() Because their parameters
have not been publicly disclosed and the algorithm has not been described
in detail, we relied on Tm predictions
that were obtained online using their software. Comparison of experimental
melting temperatures reveals that the Exiqon model tends to overestimate
melting temperatures for our validation set. The average Tm prediction error is 4.2 °C, and χ2 is equal to 7981. This level of accuracy agrees with the values
reported by the developers where a standard deviation of 5.0 °C
was obtained for Tm predictions of chimeric
LNA·DNA duplexes.() Assuming a normal
distribution of measured melting temperatures, probability P of the null hypothesis that this χ2 difference
occurs by random chance is less than 0.01. Thus, a two-tailed F-test for the ratio of χ2 values, indicates that the new parameters from Table  predict melting temperatures more accurately than the Exiqon software.

Nearest-Neighbor Parameters for Single-Base Mismatches
From the primary data set, we determined nearest-neighbor parameters
for single mismatches using SVD analysis. Table  shows eight doublet
parameters for each of 12 LNA mismatch types. Thermodynamic parameters
are influenced by flanking base pairs and the type of mismatch. The
doublet format of nearest neighbors simplifies software implementation,
but eight parameters for mismatch doublets are not unique, which was
demonstrated in . The
constraint equation (eq ) limits the number
of linearly independent parameters to seven for each mismatch type.
The unique parameters were constructed in triplet format and are listed
in Table S3 of the .

Parameters for the
difference between LNA mismatches and matched DNA·DNA pairs.

To investigate trends and relationships of mismatch
stabilities, we predicted thermodynamic values for all possible LNA
triplets with a central mismatch. Matched base pairs flank the mismatch
on both 5′ and 3′ sides. There are four possibilities
for each flanking base pair (+A·T, +T·A, +C·G, and
+G·C). Sixteen triplets, therefore, exist for each mismatch type
(+A+X+A/TYT, +A+X+C/TYG, +A+X+G/TYC, +A+X+T/TYA, +C+X+A/GYT, +C+X+C/GYG, +C+X+G/GYC, +C+X+T/GYA, +G+X+A/CYT, +G+X+C/CYG, +G+X+G/CYC, +G+X+T/CYA, +T+X+A/AYT, +T+X+C/AYG, +T+X+G/AYC, and +T+X+T/AYA).
There are 4 × 3 = 12 mismatch types because three types exist
for each LNA nucleotide (for example, +A·A, +A·C, and +A·G for LNA adenine). The total
number of unique triplets is therefore 16 × 12 = 192. Contributions
to the free energy of the duplex transition (ΔG°37) were predicted for these triplets containing
LNA mismatches, DNA mismatches, and related perfectly matched sequences
using parameters from Tables  and  and ref (). Table 1 of ref () seems to have typographical errors, so we used parameters
from Table 2 of ref () instead. To model mismatch effects in the interior of a duplex,
initiation free energies were not taken into account.

The LNA
triplets were sorted according to free energy contributions. The least
stable LNA mismatch is +A+C+T/TCA (ΔG°37 = 2.7 kcal/mol).
The same C·C mismatch context is also
the most destabilizing for DNA·DNA single-base mismatches.()

The most stable LNA mismatch is the +G·T mismatch within the context of +G+G+C/CTG (−5.5 kcal/mol).
It is interesting that the most stabilizing DNA mismatch occurs in
the same sequence context, but it is the G·G mismatch instead, GGC/CGG (−2.2 kcal/mol).

Average ΔG°37 values over 16 triplet contexts produced a trend
of decreasing stability for mismatches within consecutive LNA·DNA
base pairs: +G·T ≫ +G·G &gt; +T·G ≈ +G·A &gt; +C·A &gt; +T·T &gt; +A·G ≈ +C·T &gt; +A·A &gt; +A·C ≈ +T·C &gt; +C·C. The trend of relative stabilities of RNA·RNA mismatches closely
resembles this trend:() rG·rU ≫ rG·rG &gt; rU·rU &gt; rA·rC &gt; rC·U &gt; rA·A ≈ rA·rG ≈ rC·rC. The stability trend
of DNA·DNA mismatches shows some similarities:()G·G &gt; G·T ≈ G·A &gt; T·T ≈ A·A &gt; T·C &gt; A·C &gt; C·C. The main differences between LNAs and DNAs are the higher relative
stabilities of +G·T and +C·A mismatches and the lower relative stability of the +A·G mismatch. The order of stability of hybrid RNA·DNA mismatches
is between the trends of RNA·RNA and DNA·DNA mismatches., The most stable mismatch is the rG·T mismatch, like in RNAs, while the rC·A mismatch has relatively low stability, like in DNAs.

Mismatch Discrimination
To study the dependence of
mismatch discrimination on oligonucleotide sequence, the free energy
of mismatch discrimination (ΔΔG°)
was defined as the difference between mismatched and matched duplexes.
The ΔΔG° value quantifies the amount
of destabilization due to a mismatch. Let us define G·G mismatch discrimination in the +T+G+T/AGA LNA tripletand in the isosequential DNA tripletValues of ΔΔG° are positive because the lower stability of the mismatch makes
ΔG°37 less negative. The larger
the ΔΔG° values, the stronger the
destabilization and mismatch discrimination. The positive difference
between eqs  and  [ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)]
indicates that LNAs increased the level of mismatch discrimination.
The negative difference means that LNA modifications decreased the
level of mismatch discrimination. We have predicted these free energy
differences for the entire set of 192 possible mismatch triplets.
Figure  shows the range of ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)
values for each mismatch type. LNA modification enhances discrimination
for 85% of sequences and weakens it for 8%. Free energy differences
are insignificant, that is, between −0.2 and 0.2 kcal/mol,
for 7% of mismatches.

Differences in mismatch discrimination between LNA and
DNA sequences. Free energies of duplex destabilization caused by mismatches
[ΔΔG° = ΔG°37(mismatch) – ΔG°37(match)] were predicted for triplets containing the central
mismatch and all possible neighboring base pair combinations. The
difference between these ΔΔG° values
between LNA and DNA is plotted. The positive ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)
value implies that LNA modifications destabilize the mismatch and
increase the level of mismatch discrimination relative to DNA. Error
bars indicate the range from the minimum to the maximum value. A gray
box marks the range from the 25th to 75th percentile, and the horizontal
line within the box shows the median value.

Figure  shows that LNAs
negatively impact discrimination of +G·T mismatches and some +C·A mismatches.
It appears that base pairs flanking a mismatch affect discrimination
as well. The +G·C base pairs adjacent to a mismatch decrease
the level of discrimination, while +A·T or +T·A base pairs
increase it. To quantify this effect, we averaged ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)
differences over possible triplet sequences containing a specific
flanking base pair. The order of increasing mismatch discrimination
resulting from the flanking base pair is as follows: +G·C &lt;
+C·G &lt; +A·T ≈ +T·A [with average ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)
differences of 0.9, 1.2, 1.6, and 1.7 kcal/mol, respectively]. The
effect is not dependent on the flanking base pair location because
the base pairs on the 5′ side of the mismatch exhibit the same
trend as the base pairs on the 3′ side. In agreement with these
observations, +G+G+C/CTG and +G+C+G/CAC mismatches
exhibit the largest decreases in the level of discrimination from
DNA to LNA with ΔΔG°(LNA) –
ΔΔG°(DNA) differences of −1.7
and −1.5 kcal/mol, respectively.

The largest increases
in the level of mismatch discrimination, i.e., the most positive ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)
differences, are seen for the +C·C mismatch
in the +T+C+C/ACG triplet
(3.4 kcal/mol), the +A·G mismatch in +T+A+G/AGC and +T+A+T/AGA (3.4 kcal/mol), and the +T·C mismatch in +A+T+C/TCG (3.2 kcal/mol). LNAs significantly enhance discrimination
of all +G·G, +G·A, +A·A, and +T·T mismatches, as well.

The free energies in Figure  were calculated at 37 °C, the temperature of the human
body. In some biological applications, for instance, polymerase chain
reaction, oligonucleotides are annealed at higher temperatures. Analysis
at 60 °C reveals a similar dependence of LNA discriminatory effects
on mismatch type (data not shown). However, values of ΔΔG°(LNA) – ΔΔG°(DNA)
increased by ∼0.5 kcal/mol for the +G·T, +C·A, and +A·C mismatches. This result suggests that the positive effect of LNA
on mismatch discrimination increases with temperature. For example,
LNAs improve mismatch discrimination, in relative terms with respect
to DNA, for half of +G·T mismatches at
60 °C, while such positive effects are rare at 37 °C.

In our analysis, we assumed negligible heat capacity effects (ΔCp ∼ 0). This has also
been assumed for previously published thermodynamic parameters, although
recent comprehensive studies() detected
small heat capacity changes, ∼50 cal mol–1 K–1 bp–1. Because similar mismatch
discrimination trends are predicted at different temperatures, the
veracity of this assumption does not seem to seriously influence the
results of mismatch analysis.

Validation of Nearest-Neighbor Parameters for LNA Mismatches
To test the accuracy of mismatch parameters, we measured the stability
of LNA mismatches described in the previous paragraphs. Table  lists sequences and their melting temperatures.
Neither dye nor quencher was attached to these oligonucleotides. Their
melting temperatures were determined using ultraviolet melting experiments.
LNA modifications were predicted (1) to decrease the level of mismatch
discrimination of VAL-A and VAL-B sequences, (2) not to affect discrimination
of VAL-C and VAL-D sequences, and (3) to enhance mismatch discrimination
of VAL-E, VAL-F, and VAL-G sequences. Considering limitations of the
nearest-neighbor model,, the predicted discrimination
effects (ΔTm) agree with experimental
measurements for all seven sequence sets.

Differences between melting temperatures of mismatched and perfectly
matched duplexes.

New LNA mismatch parameters result in an average Tm prediction error of 2.9 °C for the sequences
in Table . The accuracy of DNA mismatch parameters () is the same. For DNA or LNA matched duplexes,
average errors of predicted melting temperatures are less than 1.3
°C. The lower accuracy of mismatch predictions suggests that
mismatched duplexes are more likely to deviate from assumptions of
the nearest-neighbor model and two-state transitions. A small perturbation,
like a single-nucleotide mismatch, does not usually break down assumptions
of the nearest-neighbor model, but it may increase the magnitude of
interactions propagating beyond nearest-neighbor nucleotides. These
long-range interactions are often of electrostatic origin and likely
become more significant in buffers with low counterion concentrations
(&lt;40 mM Na+). We expect the weaker H-bonding interactions
and increased nucleobase flexibility at the mismatch site. This potentially
decreases cooperativity and increases deviations from the two-state
melting behavior.

Discussion
Characteristics of Effects of LNA on Duplex Stability
The LNA modifications placed at every second or third nucleotide
position are very effective in increasing the duplex stability and
affinity for complementary targets.() Mismatch
discrimination is improved most if the triplet of consecutive LNAs
is centered on the mismatch site.() A single
LNA modification usually discriminates less. We were therefore motivated
to study thermodynamics of consecutive LNAs to expand the published
nearest-neighbor model of single LNA modifications and improve our
understanding of LNA·DNA duplex stability.

We employed
the fluorescence melting method to measure the stability of modified
oligonucleotide duplexes.() This new technology
allows measurements for large sets of duplexes with unprecedented
speed, and its accuracy is similar to the accuracy of the ultraviolet
optical melting method. Using the fluorescence method, the experimental
errors of ΔH°, ΔS°, ΔG°, and Tm were 8%, 9%, 4%, and 0.4 °C, respectively. If the duplex
melts in the two-state manner, the thermodynamic values are in agreement
between both methods. The transition enthalpies and entropies measured
using the fluorescence differed by &lt;4% from the values determined
by the UV melting method.() The free energy
values agreed within 2.5% when the optimal Texas Red–Iowa Black
RQ pair was attached to the duplex terminus. These differences are
similar or smaller than the errors seen in UV melting experiments
where the errors of ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG° are ∼8,
∼8, and ∼4%, respectively.,

The
fluorescence melting method relies on the dye–quencher pair
attached to one of the duplex termini as shown in Figure B. When the duplex melts, the dye and the quencher dissociate,
giving the increase in the magnitude of the fluorescence signal. Although
the terminal dye–quencher pair stabilizes the duplex, it is
attached to both the LNA-modified duplex and the core duplex. The
Texas Red–Iowa Black RQ labels therefore change the ΔH°, ΔS°, and ΔG° values of both duplexes to the same amount. The
thermodynamic impact of LNA modification is determined from the difference
between the LNA-modified and core duplexes. We have shown previously
that these thermodynamic differences (ΔΔH°, ΔΔS°, and ΔΔG°) are not affected by terminal labels.() The stabilizing effect of labels cancels out
in this analysis.

Using SVD, we determined nearest-neighbor
parameters for consecutive LNA·DNA base pairs. New parameters
accurately predict melting temperatures of chimeric LNA·DNA duplexes.
The average error was ∼2 °C, which is the best accuracy
that can be achieved by the nearest-neighbor model., If LNA modifications amount to a moderate perturbation of a DNA
duplex, new parameters are most accurate. Analysis of the validation
data
set (Table S2 of the ) suggests that accuracy decreases slightly as the percentage of
LNA modifications increases. The duplexes of VAL-01–VAL-33
are predicted more accurately (average error of 1.5 °C) than
VAL-34–VAL-53 duplexes (3.0 °C). The LNA content is low
for the VAL-01–VAL-33 subset (20–25%) and varies from
30 to 60% for the latter subset.

We also predicted melting temperatures
for 11 duplexes from published sources where one strand was LNA-modified
from 89 to 100%. Initiation parameters for terminal LNAs were assumed
to be identical to DNA initiation parameters.() Table S4 of the  shows results. The average error of Tm predictions was higher for these duplexes (2.7 °C) than the
error seen for the set of VAL-01–VAL-33 duplexes (1.5 °C).
If an LNA strand is modified ≥50%, LNAs induce structural changes
that could propagate beyond neighboring base pairs. In that case,
the nearest-neighbor parameters and the model may be less accurate.

Thermodynamic parameters reveal the nature of stabilizing effects.
The single strand to helix transition of nucleic acid is usually driven
by favorable enthalpic changes associated with an increased level
of stacking and H-bonding interactions. Entropic changes are unfavorable.
Because single strands explore more degrees of freedom than the strands
in the relatively stiff duplex structure, duplex formation incurs
the entropic loss. Locked nucleic acids have been reported to alter
both transition enthalpy and entropy,, so the origin
of LNA effects is uncertain.

The free energy change due to LNA
residues can be divided into enthalpic (ΔΔH°) and entropic (−TΔΔS°) components, which are presented in the second and
last columns, respectively, of Table . The
values suggest that the stabilizing effect is of enthalpic origin.
Consecutive LNAs induce favorable changes in the transition enthalpy,
making it more negative by −1 to −9 kcal/mol per each
nearest-neighbor doublet. Changes in the entropic contribution to
the free energy (the last column of Table ) are either unfavorable or negligible. The values of −TΔΔS° range from 0 to
7 kcal/mol at 37 °C and are smaller in magnitude than ΔΔH°. Thus, we conclude that the higher stability of
consecutive LNA·DNA base pairs is mostly the result of favorable
contributions to the transition enthalpy. This is the case for all
nearest-neighbor doublets, confirming that enthalpy drives stabilization
of consecutive LNAs regardless of base sequence.

These thermodynamic
observations are related to structural changes. Stabilizing enthalpic
effects of LNAs are equated with enhanced stacking interactions, potentially
improved H-bonding of base pairs, and weakened hydration of the duplex
state.() The LNA cytosine C5-methyl group,
which is not
present in the native DNA, may also increase the stacking energies
due to additional van der Waals interactions with neighboring bases.() The entropic contributions of LNAs originate
from backbone conformational preorganization, which is the result
of restrictions of ribose flexibility in the C3′-endo (N-type)
conformation., Because the modified ribose is
similarly constrained in the single
strand and in the duplex conformations, it has been argued that the
smaller entropic loss occurs upon formation of LNA·DNA rather
than DNA·DNA base pairs.

While we observe that the stabilization
of consecutive LNAs is driven by enthalpic changes, McTigue et al.
reported that the stabilizing effects of a single LNA modification
are mostly entropic in origin.() Taken
together, these findings suggest that the entropic changes characterized
by restriction of nucleotide local conformations are achieved by the
introduction of a single LNA nucleotide. Additional adjacent LNAs
stabilize the duplex further by favorable enthalpic changes. This
mechanism may explain the conflicting reports in the literature regarding
the origin of LNA stabilization.

Structural studies have shown
that both isolated and consecutive LNA residues restrict ribose conformation
space and introduce structural changes in the double helix toward
A-form. For example, LNAs widen the minor groove and decrease the
value of the rise and the twist.− The 1H NMR experiment with the
C+TGA+TA+TGC sequence that contains only isolated LNA modifications
failed to show significant changes in base stacking.() In contrast, LNAs in the C+TGC+T+TC+TGC sequence containing
consecutive modifications enhanced base stacking.() Our fluorescence experiments using 2-aminopurine also detected
enhanced stacking interactions in LNA triplets.() These apparent discrepancies can be reconciled assuming
that the energetic impact of a single LNA in the duplex interior is
dominated by entropic changes, and the subsequent addition of consecutive
LNAs stabilizes duplexes by favorable enthalpic changes that are associated
with enhanced stacking interactions.

Energetics of LNA modifications
introduced at the duplex terminus may have a different character.
Kaur et al. measured impacts of isolated LNA modifications at various
positions.() The interior modifications
decreased entropic
loss in agreement with our rationale, but stabilizing effects of the
terminal modification were driven by favorable enthalpic changes.
We have not studied consecutive LNAs at the duplex terminus.

The A-form helical conformation that is preferred by LNA·DNA
duplexes is also dominant in RNA·RNA and RNA·DNA duplexes.
In fact, ribose puckering of the LNA·DNA duplex resembles closely
the puckering of the RNA·DNA hybrid.() However, the structural similarity does not mean the same thermodynamic
parameters. The LNA·DNA nearest-neighbor doublets are on average
1.4 kcal/mol more stable than RNA·DNA doublets.() For example, the ΔG°37 of +C+C/GG is −4.1 kcal/mol, while rCrC/GG is only half as
stabilizing, −2.1 kcal/mol. The sequence dependence of parameters
is also different. The least stable LNA doublet is +A+A/TT, while
the rArA/TT doublet is more stable than five other RNA·DNA doublets.
These significant differences reveal that thermodynamic parameters
of RNA·DNA duplexes are not good approximations of LNA·DNA
thermodynamics. The different composition of the ribose moiety, different
patterns of hydration in the minor groove, the extra methyl group
of +C, and subtle variations of the helical structure potentially
explain these thermodynamic differences.

Enhanced Mismatch Discrimination Is Not Unique for Locked Nucleic
Acids
We show in  that LNA·DNA
and RNA·RNA mismatches exhibit a similar trend of stabilities,
which deviates from the stability trend of DNA mismatches. To inquire
whether the mismatch discrimination is similarly enhanced in RNA duplexes,
like it is enhanced in LNAs, we predicted the free energy of mismatch
discrimination (eq ) for RNA, RNA·DNA,
LNA, and DNA triplets. For each mismatch type, the ΔΔG° values were averaged over 16 possible triplet sequences
containing the central mismatch. Predictions were based on the established
nearest-neighbor parameters for matched LNA, DNA, and RNA base pairs
(Table  and refs (), (), and ()). For mismatches,
the complete set of thermodynamic parameters is available for LNA·DNA
and DNA·DNA pairs (Table  and ref ()). Because parameters for
many RNA·DNA mismatches are unknown, we averaged ΔΔG° for eight rG·T sequence
contexts reported by the Sugimoto group() and predicted the average ΔΔG°
values for rA·A, rG·G, and rC·C mismatches. Their parameters
were recently determined.() The rA·rA, rG·rG, and rC·rC RNA·RNA mismatches were approximated
by the algorithm of Davis and Znosko.() Mathews, Sabina, Zuker, and Turner parameters were used for the rG·rU mismatch.() The
RNA calculations were conducted with MELTING version 5.0.3.()

Figure  shows
the average free energies of duplex destabilization due to a mismatch.
The general trend of increasing discriminatory power for the A·A, G·G, and C·C mismatches is as follows: DNA·DNA ≪
RNA·DNA &lt; RNA·RNA ≤ LNA·DNA. These mismatches
destabilize the LNA·DNA and RNA·RNA duplexes more than the
DNA·DNA duplexes. To a lesser degree, the level of mismatch discrimination
also increases in RNA·DNA duplexes. The opposite trend is seen
for the wobble G·T base pair. The DNA·DNA
mismatch shows the strongest discrimination. The +G·T, rG·T, and rG·rU mismatches discriminate less.

Free energies of duplex destabilization
due to a mismatch [ΔΔG° = ΔG°37(mismatch) – ΔG°37(match)] were predicted for triplets containing
the central mismatch. The ΔΔG° values
are averaged for each mismatch over 16 possible nearest-neighbor base
contexts and are plotted as a function of nucleic acid backbone character
(DNA, RNA, LNA, and hybrid duplexes). The free energy of rG·T mismatch discrimination was averaged over eight
available triplet contexts.()

This analysis suggests that the enhanced mismatch
discrimination is not a unique property of locked nucleic acids but
rather the result of structural changes of nucleic acids from B-form
to A-form. DNA·DNA duplexes in water solutions are in B-like
conformations. The RNA·DNA hybrids fold into structures that
are intermediates of A- and B-forms. The RNA·RNA duplexes occur
in the A-form conformation, which is also the structure of LNA·DNA
base pairs., As the conformational equilibrium
is shifted toward the A-form, the level of mismatch discrimination
increases. This is likely the result of energetic changes in stacking
interactions, H-bonding of base pairs, and hydration envelope when
the duplex turns to the A-like conformation.

The one significant
structural change from B-form to A-form is the compaction of the rise
between base pairs along the helical axis. The rise is significantly
smaller in the A-form (0.26 nm) than in the B-form (0.34 nm). Because
of the shorter distances, LNA nucleotides in the A-like structure
may engage in stronger stacking interactions, which are disrupted
by mismatches. If our hypothesis is correct, the enhancements of mismatch
discrimination can be expected for any modification that shifts the
conformation equilibrium from B-form to A-form, e.g., 2′-O-methyl-RNA, 2′-O-[2-(methoxy)ethyl]-RNA,
2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-RNA, and N3′→P5′-phosphoramidate-DNA.− As discussed earlier, +G·T mismatches
are the exception; their level of mismatch discrimination decreases
when LNA-modified guanine is introduced at the mismatch site. This
could be a result of improved stacking interactions of guanine with
neighboring bases. These stacking interactions are not significantly
weakened by a thymine mismatch because the G·T pair is stabilized
by two hydrogen bonds and is well-stacked in the duplex structure.
Small pyridine bases are expected to stack less than large purine
bases. This may explain the opposite discriminatory effects of LNAs
in +T·G versus +G·T mismatches.

Chemical differences among LNA, RNA, and DNA are
the composition and conformation of the ribose moiety. Another difference
is the C5-methyl group in pyrimidine nucleobases. In RNA, uracil and
cytosine are typically unmethylated. In DNA, thymine is C5-methylated
and cytosine is not. In LNA nucleotides, both thymine and cytosine
are C5-methylated.

Wang and Kool investigated thermodynamic
effects of C5-methyl and 2′-OH groups in DNA and RNA duplexes.() The methyl group stabilized duplexes on average
by 0.25 kcal/mol, and its effects on ΔG°
were largely independent of 2′-hydroxyl effects. The C5-methyl
appeared to enhance base stacking. Ziomek et al. studied 5-alkyl and
5-halogen analogues of uracil in (rArUrCrUrArGrArU)2 duplexes.() The methyl group stabilized the RNA duplex slightly
(ΔΔG° &lt; 0.1 kcal/mol). Sugimoto
et al. examined thermodynamics of pyridine methyl groups in RNA·DNA
mismatches.() The rG·dU mismatches
were found to be less stable than rG·dT mismatches regardless of neighboring sequence context. The free
energy contribution of the thymine C5-methyl was estimated to vary
from 0.1 to 0.5 kcal/mol. The methyl moiety likely has a similar thermodynamic
impact on the LNA cytosine residue.()

The extra methyl group of pyrimidines is not the driver of mismatch
discrimination trends. The increase in the level of discrimination
occurs in purine mismatches (+A·A and +G·G) and in the sequence contexts that do not contain
methylated LNA cytosine. For example, LNAs increase free energies
of +A·A mismatch discrimination in the
center of the +G+A+G triplet by 1.0 kcal/mol. Further, relative to
DNA, the extra C5-methyl group is present in LNA cytosine, but not
in RNA cytosine. In both cases, the level of mismatch discrimination
increases; i.e., both LNA and RNA duplexes have more discriminatory
power than DNA. The presence of the C5-methyl group does not appear
to be essential for discriminatory effects.

Oligonucleotide Design and Online Software
Sufficient
mismatch discrimination is important for many oligonucleotide applications.
Locked nucleic acids enhance discrimination due to two impacts. First,
LNAs increase the stability of oligonucleotide probes. This allows
the use of shorter sequences with more discriminatory power because
the mismatch has a much larger impact on the duplex stability in shorter
sequences than in longer ones.() This length
effect is very significant in duplexes with &lt;30 bp. The ΔΔG° and ΔTm differences
between matched and single-base mismatched duplexes can double when
the duplex length is decreased from 25 to 17 bp.

Second, locked
nucleic acids can also increase specificity directly if they are located
at or next to the mismatch site. We have discovered that the triplet
of LNA residues containing the mismatch in the center has the largest
discriminatory power; a single LNA modification usually discriminates
less.() We therefore recommend using the
LNA triplet
at the mismatch site. This design will increase the discriminatory
power for a majority of mismatches (in particular, for A·G, T·C, C·C, G·G, A·A, and T·T). New results
also pinpoint several anomalies. LNAs in some +G·T and +C·A mismatches impact discrimination
negatively. In these cases, is it not advised to introduce the LNA
modifications at the mismatch site, but LNAs could be placed ≥2
bp from the mismatch to increase the stability of the probe–target
duplex and make the probe shorter. The short probe will likely exhibit
more discriminatory power. Alternatively, the probe could be redesigned
to target the complementary strand if it is available in the biological
sample. This will change the +G·T mismatch
into the +T·G mismatch; the latter one
is more likely to show positive effects of LNA on discrimination.

It is also important to optimize the location of mismatches within
the probe. The mismatches at the terminus or adjacent to the terminus
(penultimate mismatches) show significantly less discrimination than
the mismatches in the duplex interior., It is preferable
to place mismatches at least 3 bp from the termini of the probe–target
duplex. Although the mismatch site in the center of the duplex maximizes
the discrimination, it is not essential for the mismatch to be located
exactly in the center of the oligonucleotide probe. As long as the
mismatch is positioned in the interior of the duplex and not next
to the termini, its discriminatory power (ΔΔG°) will be very close to the maximum.

To help design optimal
LNA oligonucleotides, free software is available at the IDT websites http://biophysics.idtdna.com and http://www.idtdna.com. The web tools predict melting temperatures, free energies, and
the extent of hybridization using the latest nearest-neighbor parameters,
including parameters from Tables  and . It is important to enter conditions of the experiments
(e.g., cation and DNA concentrations) to obtain the relevant predictions.
Users can test effects of LNA modifications and mismatches at any
location within their sequence. The potential LNA probes can be compared
with unmodified probes to estimate benefits of modifications. The
probes can be ranked by their mismatch discrimination energetics (ΔΔG° and ΔTm) and tuned
to the hybridization temperature of a specific application. It is
often optimal if the probe has a melting temperature 3–5 °C
above the annealing temperature. The perfectly matched probe–target
duplex will be stable, while the mismatched duplex is likely to be
unstable under those conditions and will not give a false positive
signal.

Many applications also require that chimeric oligonucleotides
bind effectively and exclusively to DNA complements. The design must
therefore exclude sequences that can form stable hairpins, dimers,
and other self-folding structures. This is important because LNA·LNA
base pairs are more stable than isosequential LNA·DNA base pairs.() Because thermodynamic parameters for LNA·LNA
base pairs, LNA bulges, and hairpin loops are unknown, it is not currently
possible to accurately predict the propensity of an LNA oligonucleotide
to form self-folding structures. The simple approach is to avoid long
stretches of consecutive LNAs. This approach makes stable LNA·LNA
duplexes less likely to appear but also unnecessarily impedes probe
design. Accurate predictions of LNA·LNA base pair stability would
be useful.

The tendency of the base sequence to form hairpins
can be estimated by the hairpin function of the IDT OligoAnalyzer
tool.() The self-dimer function shows the
potentially
stable structures that can form between two molecules. The heterodimer
function estimates interactions between the probe and the primers.
If the predicted structure contains several consecutive LNA·LNA
base pairs, it could be stable enough to compete with the formation
of the probe–target duplex and the assay would be negatively
impacted. For such sequences, a single LNA modification could be a
better choice than the LNA triplet.

The design of real-time
PCR hydrolysis probes (e.g., TaqMan probes) calls for additional considerations.
This family of assays relies on the 5′ exonuclease activity
of the polymerase, which degrades the probe and releases the dye attached
to the 5′ terminus of the probe. Locked nucleic acids cannot
be introduced at the 5′ terminus of the probe or at the adjacent
nucleotide because they would increase nuclease resistance and interfere
with the desired probe degradation.

Future Challenges
Although the new parameter set is
a significant addition toward a complete thermodynamic model of LNA
modifications, parameters for some important LNA structures have yet
to be determined (mismatches adjacent to a single LNA modification,
LNA·LNA base pairs, bulges, and tandem mismatches). We also do
not have parameters for LNAs at duplex termini, although such modifications
are employed in PCR primers. The parameters in Table  were determined for mismatches located in the interior of
a duplex and will not be accurate at the terminus. The mismatch in
the terminal or penultimate position often affects duplex stability
less than the same mismatch located in the interior, i.e., ≥3
bp from the terminus of the duplex.()
