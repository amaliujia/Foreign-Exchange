Nonheme Fe(II)/αKG-dependent
oxygenases make up a large superfamily of enzymes catalyzing diverse
reactions, including demethylations, hydroxylations, ring expansions,
and epoxidations., Many of these enzymes have important
functions in human health because of their role in O2 sensing,, DNA repair,, histone demethylation, and RNA processing,, making this
superfamily a growing class of therapeutic targets., As the consensus chemical mechanism is an ordered sequential one,
with O2 reacting at the Fe prior to oxidation of the primary
substrate (Scheme ),, identifying features of the active site by which substrate binding
stimulates O2 reactivity is crucial to understanding the
chemistry of this superfamily. An ideal enzyme for interrogating these
connections is Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), because of the extensive
contacts with the primary substrate.

Proposed Chemical Mechanism of FIH
Human cells sense O2 through the hypoxia inducible
factor
(HIF) pathway, which is controlled by a small number of αKG
oxygenases, including FIH., HIF is an αβ
dimeric transcription factor that regulates numerous genes involved
in tissue development, controlling processes such as glycolysis, erythropoiesis,
and angiogenesis.,− In the presence
of O2, FIH hydroxylates the β-carbon of HIF1α-Asn803, which is found in the C-terminal
activation domain (CTAD) of HIF1α. CTAD-Asn803 hydroxylation
blocks recruitment of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREBP),
preventing HIF-dependent gene transcription., The
connection between CTAD-Asn803 positioning and O2 reactivity is critical to understanding how substrate stimulates
O2 activation in this enzyme superfamily, as well as illuminating
FIH’s role as an O2 sensor.

The consensus
chemical mechanism for FIH is based upon an array
of kinetic and spectroscopic studies of FIH and other αKG oxygenases.
Kinetic studies of thymine hydroxylase, FIH, CAS, and TauD support
the ordered, sequential binding of αKG and primary substrate
followed by O2.− Although αKG, O2, and an oxidizable
compound are all substrates for these enzymes, we will refer to the
oxidizable substrate as the “primary substrate”. Spectroscopic
studies of CAS,− TfdA, FIH, and TauD revealed
that the Fe(II) released an aquo ligand after the primary substrate
bound, creating a site for O2 binding. Binding and activation
of O2 lead to the oxidative decarboxylation of αKG
and the formation of a highly reactive ferryl intermediate (Scheme ). Although the precise sequence of intermediates
is not known, the ferryl intermediate has been observed in TauD− and P4H, demonstrating that H atom
abstraction by the ferryl intermediate occurs, with the next step likely to be •OH rebound
to hydroxylate the primary substrate.

The most intriguing feature
of the consensus mechanism is that
binding the primary substrate stimulates O2 reactivity.,, Loss of an aquo ligand when the
primary substrate is bound opens a coordination site for O2 binding, as observed upon binding of the primary substrate in several
αKG-dependent oxygenases, including CytC3, TauD, CAS, and FIH.,, Although aquo release is central
to the widely accepted model for substrate-stimulated O2 activation, we note that simple ligand
exchange is insufficient for O2 activation in these enzymes.
For example, substrate binding to FIH leads to only fractional release
of the aquo ligand, and mutagenesis suggests
that hydrogen bond donors to the αKG are necessary for full
activity in this enzyme. Computational
studies− and mechanistic probes− further point to turnover being
limited by steps after O2 binds to the Fe(II). These and
related observations lead us to propose that substrate-stimulated
O2 reactivity arises from bonding changes throughout the
active site, ranging from aquo release at the iron cofactor to altered
contacts in the second coordination sphere.

A focus of this
research in our lab is to identify those active
site features that change upon substrate binding to stimulate O2 activation in αKG oxygenases. Although the precise
sequence of intermediates formed during turnover is not known, we
define O2 activation as the steps between O2 binding and oxidative decarboxylation (Scheme ) by virtue of the irreversible chemistry; this step is depicted
as the nucleophilic attack of the putative ferric superoxide on the
α-keto position of αKG. On the basis of known crystal
structures of FIH,,, we have used point mutagenesis to identify several essential second-coordination
sphere interactions in FIH, including those hydrogen bonding to Fe(II)
ligands, as well as FIH-Gln239, an anchor residue that
forms two hydrogen bonds with the target residue, CTAD-Asn803 (Figure ). Intriguingly,
disruption of this two-point hydrogen bond in the FIH-Gln239 → Asn point mutant led to a decrease in kcat of 250-fold, but a negligible change in KM(CTAD). This was attributed
to a combination of steric hindrance near the open coordination site
on Fe(II) and incorrect CTAD positioning for the HAT step. Subsequently,
it was shown that an irreversible step associated with O2 activation was rate-limiting in wild-type FIH (WT-FIH), suggesting that the slower turnover for the
Gln239 → Asn variant could arise from slower O2 activation. This suggests the intriguing possibility that
target residue position may stimulate O2 activation and
that the overall structure of the active site is crucial for O2 activation.

are
given in angstroms (Protein Data Bank entry 1H2L()).

This study tests the
role of Gln239 in substrate hydroxylation
in αKG oxygenases. As FIH hydroxylates a specific target residue
within a large peptide (CTAD-Asn803), our focus was directed
at this target residue pocket, formed by the side chains of FIH residues
Tyr102, His199, Arg238, and Gln239 (Figure ). Five FIH-Gln239 → X variants were prepared (X = Ala, Asn, Glu, His, and Leu)
to vary the bulk and hydrogen bonding potential within the target
residue pocket. Although these variants exhibited significantly reduced
steady-state rate constants that decreased monotonically with increasing
residue bulk, CTAD binding affinity was unaffected by mutation. In
contrast to the case in WT-FIH, O2 activation was appreciably
uncoupled from CTAD hydroxylation in the variants; uncoupled O2 activation was partially suppressed in D2O. These
data establish that the proper orientation of CTAD-Asn803 by FIH-Gln239 is required for substrate hydroxylation,
most likely because of the need for the proper target residue positioning
during steps after O2 activation.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
All reagents were purchased from commercial
vendors and were not further purified, with the exception of the 39-mer
CTAD peptide. The 39-mer CTAD peptide corresponding to the C-terminal
activation domain of human HIF1α, (HIF1α788–826) contained a Cys800 → Ala change (underlined)
(DESGLPQLTSYDAEVNAPIQGSRNLLQGEELLRALDQVN).
This was purchased as a desalted peptide from EZBiolab (Carmel, IN)
with free N- and C-termini. The peptide was purified as previously
described using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) to obtain &gt;95% pure CTAD. The
19-mer CTAD peptide corresponding to HIF1α788–806 also contained a Cys800 → Ala change and was purchased
at &gt;95% purity from EZBiolab with free N- and C-termini. The CTAD-Asn803 → Gln peptide was the 19-mer sequence but contained
the Asn803 → Gln change (DESGLPQLTSYDAEVQAPI).

FIH Mutations
The Stratagene QuikChange
mutagenesis
kit was used to introduce the mutations into the pET28a-FIH construct. All mutations were sequenced (Genewiz) to confirm
that the DNA sequence contained only the desired point mutation. Sequenced
plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression.

Protein Expression and Purification
WT-FIH and all
variants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli with
an N-terminal His6 tag and purified as previously described. Three additional residues (NH2-GlySerHis-)
from the fusion protein remained on the N-terminus following thrombin
cleavage. Purified FIH was buffer-exchanged into 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.00).
The purity (&gt;95%) of each variant was assessed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis.

Steady-State Kinetics Assays
All
assays used saturating
concentrations of FeSO4 (25 μM) and ascorbate (2
mM) and an ambient O2 concentration (217 μM at 37.0
°C) and were performed in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.00) at 37.0 °C
unless specifically noted otherwise. DTT (200 μM) was added
to assays for FIH-Gln239 → His and FIH-Gln239 → Glu when these variants were tested in D2O,
as nonlinear progress curves were observed otherwise. Assays in which
CTAD was the varied substrate (from 15 to 300 μM) utilized a
saturating αKG concentration (500 μM). Assays with αKG
as the varied substrate (from 2.5 to 100 μM) utilized a fixed
CTAD concentration of 100 μM [∼KM(CTAD)] to conserve on the use of the peptide. Assay reagents
were mixed and incubated for 2 min at 37.0 °C before the addition
of enzyme ([E]T = 1.5–10 μM). Reaction aliquots
(5 μL) were quenched with a 75% acetonitrile/0.2% TFA mixture
(20 μL) saturated with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid
and analyzed for peptide hydroxylation using a Bruker Daltonics Omniflex
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF MS) instrument. Initial rates were determined from five
to seven quenched time points (0 to ∼15% fractional conversion).
The nonlinear least-squares fitting of initial rate data to the Michaelis–Menten
equation yielded the apparent steady-state rate constants, kcat and kcat/KM. All assays were replicated a minimum of three
times.

Solvent Kinetic Isotope Effects (SKIEs)
Steady-state
assays for SKIEs were performed under the same conditions reported
above, with the exception that all reagents were prepared in D2O. Deuterium oxide (D, 99.9%) was purchased from Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA) and used as received. Working FIH
stock solutions were made by diluting high-concentration stocks from
H2O into D2O containing 50 mM HEPES (pD 7.00).
Assays were performed in 50 mM HEPES (pD 7.00), with a final D2O percentage estimated to be 96%. SKIEs were calculated from
the direct comparison of kinetic parameters observed in buffers containing
H2O and D2O; e.g., D2Okcat = kcat(H2O)/kcat(D2O).

Succinate Quantification
The coupling between the two
half-reactions was determined by monitoring the production of succinate
and CTADOH concentrations in several quench points from
a common reaction. Reactions of αKG (500 μM), FeSO4 (25 μM), CTAD (350 μM), and FIH (5–10
μM) were conducted at 37.0 °C and analyzed similarly using
previously reported procedures.,, As HEPES interfered with the succinate analysis, the reaction buffer
consisted of 50 mM Tris (pL 7.00). A Hamilton PRP-X300 anion exclusion
column was used to separate the succinate produced from the quenched
reactions, and UV detection at 210 nm was used to determine the succinate
concentration. Using aliquots from the same quenched assay, a Bruker
Daltonics Omniflex MALDI-TOF MS was used to determine the CTADOH concentration. The coupling ratio (C) was
determined by taking the ratio of the rate of succinate formation
and the rate of CTADOH formation from matched time points.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The FIH–CTAD binding
constants were measured through quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan
fluorescence of (Co + αKG)FIH upon CTAD binding at room temperature
(∼20 °C). The fluorescence cuvette contained FIH (1.5
μM), CoSO4 (25 μM), αKG (500 μM),
and 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.05). This solution was titrated with 50 mM HEPES
(pH 7.05) containing CTAD (1 mM), FIH (1.5 μM), CoSO4 (25 μM), and αKG (500 μM). All titrations were
performed aerobically. After each addition of titrant, samples were
gently mixed and allowed to equilibrate for 5 min before being excited
at 295 nm. The fluorescence intensities at 330 nm were plotted versus
the total CTAD concentration and fit using eq where I is
the measured fluorescence intensity, [E] is the protein concentration,
[S] is the total CTAD concentration, n is the number
of binding sites, and KD is the binding
affinity. The initial intensity (I0) and
final intensity (If) were obtained from
measured spectra.

Results
Variants of FIH-Gln239 were used to test the effect
of target residue positioning on substrate hydroxylation in FIH. The
variants were designed to vary hydrogen bonding potential (Gln239 → Glu and Gln239 → His) and cavity
size (Gln239 → Ala, Gln239 → Asn,
and Gln239 → Leu) in the target residue pocket of
FIH. The Gln239 variants were kinetically characterized
in the steady state with CTAD as the varied substrate, giving the
apparent rate constants kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD). The
kinetic characterization revealed significantly diminished rate constants
for turnover, leading us to determine the binding affinity of CTAD
as well as the coupling ratio of the two half-reactions for each point
mutant.

Kinetic Characterization of Gln239 → X Variants
We hypothesized the positioning of CTAD-Asn803 by FIH-Gln239 was necessary to support turnover and therefore focused
our studies on steady-state characterization by monitoring CTADOH formation via MALDI-TOF. Although O2 uptake was
the first method that we considered, the slow turnover for FIH makes
high-precision kinetic determinations by this method challenging.
Assays using fixed concentrations of αKG (500 μM) and
O2 (217 μM) and varied concentrations of CTAD (15–300
μM) were used to measure initial rates, which where then fit
to the Michaelis–Menten equation to obtain the apparent steady-state
rate constants, kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD). The Michaelis
constant for αKG was determined for each variant [KM(αKG) = 4–7 μM], which was slightly
lower than that for WT-FIH [KM(αKG) = 16 μM]. Because of the O2 concentration is subsaturating,
the apparent kcat encompasses all steps
after CTAD binding, including those involved in O2 binding
and activation. All of the Gln239 → X variants exhibited
a significant decrease in kcat (Figure ). The Gln239 → Ala (kcat = 1.27 ± 0.10 min–1) variant
was most active, as the kcat decreased
20-fold relative to that of WT-FIH, whereas the kcat for Gln239 → Asn (0.14 ± 0.02
min–1) decreased 200-fold. The kcat for variants capable of one-point hydrogen bonding
decreased &gt;1200-fold: Gln239 → His (0.023 ±
0.003 min–1) and Gln239 → Glu
(0.024 ± 0.002 min–1). We were unable to observe
hydroxylation from the Gln239 → Leu variant.

ascorbate (2 mM), αKG (500 μM), FeSO4 (25 μM),
and CTAD (0–300 μM) were in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.00). The
inset shows the steady-state kinetics of Q239N (▲),Q239H (■),
and Q239E (◆) in H2O. FIH (1.5–30 μM),
ascorbate (2 mM), αKG (500 μM), FeSO4 (25 μM),
and CTAD (0–300 μM) were in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.00).

Steps from CTAD binding through
the first irreversible step (decarboxylation)
comprise kcat/KM(CTAD) (Scheme ). The effect of each point variant
on kcat/KM(CTAD) was nearly identical to their effect on kcat, indicating that the variants affected a step that was separate
from CTAD binding.

Minimal Chemical Scheme for Uncoupling
We tested the activity of FIH-Gln239 → Asn using
a 19-mer CTAD peptide containing the complementary CTAD-Asn803 → Gln point mutation, which switched the residues at this
interface. This switch mutation was designed to restore the bulk and
hydrogen bonds observed between WT-FIH and WT-CTAD. However, the activity
level was below our detection limit (0.002 min–1), as hydroxylated CTAD-Asn803 → Gln was not detected
upon being incubated with FIH-Gln239 → Asn. WT-FIH
was similarly unreactive toward this variant CTAD, as WT-FIH hydroxylated
the 19-mer WT-CTAD with an appreciable rate, but did not hydroxylate
the variant CTAD (Table ).

Binding Affinity of CTAD for Gln239 → X Variants
The binding affinity of each FIH variant for CTAD was measured
by titration using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of FIH. A
solution containing CTAD (1 mM) was titrated into a solution containing
FIH (1.5 μM) while the fluorescence at 330 nm was monitored
(λex = 295 nm); both solutions were anaerobic and
contained CoSO4 (25 μM) and αKG (500 μM).
The change in fluorescence intensity (330 nm) was plotted as a function
of CTAD concentration and fit to eq . The experimentally
determined KD for each point mutant (Table ) was similar to that of WT-FIH (78 ± 7 μM),
indicating the thermodynamics of CTAD binding was not affected by
point mutation.

Uncoupled Turnover
in the Gln239 → X Variants
The kinetic
parameters of the Gln239 → X mutations
led us to explore the coupling of O2 activation to substrate
hydroxylation. We hypothesized that if the conformational state of
CTAD-Asn803 were incorrect for HAT, then the two half-reactions
would uncouple to produce more succinate than hydroxylated product
(CTADOH). Quenched aliquots from reaction mixtures containing
saturating concentrations of αKG (500 μM) and CTAD (350
μM) in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.00) were analyzed for CTADOH via MALDI-TOF MS and succinate via HPLC. Tris buffer was used for
these assays to minimize the background signal in the HPLC chromatograms
that arose due to buffer components.

The coupling values for
the Gln239 → X (X = Ala, Asn, Glu, and His) variants
were obtained by taking the ratio of the rates of formation for succinate
and CTADOH. Variants produced three to five succinates
per equivalent of CTADOH; succinate formation was observed
for the Gln239 → Leu variant [kobs(suc) = 0.08 min–1], indicating O2 activation occurred even though CTAD hydroxylation was not
detected for this variant (Table ). This uncoupling
is similar to the values found previously for second-coordination
sphere variants of FIH.

The coupling of WT, Gln239 → Ala,
and Gln239 → Asn in deuterated buffer was used to
determine
if the coupling ratio changed between protonated and deuterated buffers.
The coupling for WT FIH in H2O (C = 1.0
± 0.1) and D2O (C = 1.0 ± 0.1)
was in agreement with our previous work, showing WT remains tightly coupled under all tested conditions.
However, the coupling ratio in D2O for Gln239 → Ala (C = 1.4 ± 0.2) and Gln239 → Asn (C = 2.2 ± 0.2) approached unity,
indicating that solvent deuteration led to more tightly coupled turnover
for these variants.

Solvent Kinetic Isotope Effects (SKIEs)
SKIEs on both kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD) were used to
test the importance of
solvent-dependent steps during turnover. Initial rates from steady-state
assays using saturating αKG concentrations (500 μM), ambient
O2 concentrations (217 μM), and varied concentrations
of CTAD (15–300 μM) were fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation (Figure ). Turnover was faster in
D2O with both WT-FIH and each variant, leading to an inverse
SKIE on kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD) (Table ). However, these SKIEs must be considered in the context
of the solvent-dependent uncoupling observed for the variants.

Discussion
The
ordered sequential consensus mechanism for αKG oxygenases
leads to coupled turnover when primary substrate binding stimulates
reactivity toward O2, a phenomenon termed substrate-induced
activity enhancement, priming, or triggering by
different groups. As primary substrate does not directly bind to the
Fe(II), altered local contacts within the active site likely stimulate
O2 activation. Although the idea of stimulated O2 activation refers to the empirical observation of increased turnover
rates induced by substrate binding, the dominant model used to explain
this focuses on aquo release, which creates an open coordination site
for O2 binding. In our opinion,
broader changes within the active site are correlated with this effect,
such as the position of the primary substrate.

FIH is notable
in that enzyme–substrate contacts are quite
extensive because the substrate is a large peptide (CTAD), with the
target residue positioned above the Fe by a two-point hydrogen bond
to the side chain of an anchoring residue, FIH-Gln239., This study varied the sterics and H-bonding potential of this anchor
residue to test its role in hydroxylating CTAD-Asn803.

CTAD Hydroxylation
Is Slowed by Gln239 Variants
Each of the Gln239 → X variants (X = Ala, Asn,
Glu, His, or Leu) altered the hydrogen bond potential and/or bulk
of the target residue pocket, disrupting the positioning of the target
residue. This incorrect positioning could have impacted any one of
several steps within the kinetic mechanism, which may be distinguished
through analysis of steady-state kinetic parameters and coupling ratios.
The significant reduction in kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD) relative
to those of WT-FIH indicated that the anchor residue played a prominent
role in supporting turnover. Keeping in mind the observation that
the binding affinity of CTAD was unchanged from that of WT-FIH (Table ), we are led to conclude that the predominant role
of FIH-Gln239 is to position substrate for a chemical step
rather than to bind CTAD.

Although it may seem surprising that
the anchor residue FIH-Gln239 contributes very little to
the CTAD binding affinity, this is consistent with prior studies of
CTAD variants. As the length of the CTAD has been shown to have a
significant affect on the KM, and the binding affinity of WT-FIH for CTAD
is indistinguishable from the Michaelis constant, it appears that
the dominant factor in CTAD binding is the surface contact with FIH,
with only minor contributions from the target residue pocket. Alanine
scanning point mutagenesis of CTAD revealed that CTAD-Val802 was the most significant residue for CTAD binding, with a 2-fold
increase in the KM(CTAD) for the CTAD-Val802 → Ala variant. Molecular
dynamics studies suggested that this mutation led to reorientation
of Asn803, perhaps because of disruption of the tight turn
conformation in residues 801–803 of CTAD. Further support for
a minimal impact of FIH-Gln239 on CTAD binding is the observation
that FIH hydroxylates substrates with target residues other than asparagine., The structural features of these substrates suggest the overall
contact between FIH and the CTAD peptide is important in determining
substrate binding to FIH.,

Inverse SKIEs and Coupling
We recently reported inverse
SKIEs for WT FIH, on both kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD). This was due to the isotopically sensitive metal–aquo
fractionation prior to a rate-limiting step for WT-FIH. Importantly,
WT-FIH exhibited fully coupled turnover, such that O2 activation
always led to substrate hydroxylation. Consequently, it was deduced
that the rate-limiting step for kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD) was
an irreversible step immediately after aquo release. This step is
depicted as the oxidative decarboxylation of αKG in Scheme .

For each of the Gln239 →
X variants, inverse SKIEs were measured on both kcat and kcat/KM(CTAD) when determined from the rate of CTADOH formation (Table ). Although the SKIE data
resembled those reported for WT-FIH, turnover for these variants was
significantly uncoupled, which precluded the use of SKIEs to diagnose
rate-limiting steps in the steady state. Nevertheless, uncoupling
in the variants depended on solvent isotopic composition (Table ), suggesting that the ferryl intermediate could
form even when CTAD was improperly positioned. The fact that C approached unity in D2O for these variants
suggested that the main effect of the Gln239 → X
change was to perturb the hydroxylation step.

Sterics and H-Bonding Impact
Substrate Hydroxylation
A simple model to explain how the
target residue pocket impacts productive
turnover is one in which multiple conformational states of the target
residue are adopted but only one conformation supports hydroxylation.
X-ray crystal structures of (M+αKG)FIH bound to CTAD or Notch-derived peptides revealed that the target residue adopted a specific rotameric
conformation, with a side chain torsional angle (HN–Cα–Cβ–Cγ) of −71°.
This is observed for both Notch target residues Notch-Asn210 and Notch-Asn1945 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 3P3P and 3P3N, respectively].
As a good deal of flexibility near Gln239 was observed
crystallographically for (Fe+αKG)FIH when CTAD was absent (PDB
entry 1MZF), changing the hydrogen bonding potential and
packing density of this anchor residue should alter the target residue
position above the Fe(II). The significant reduction in catalytic
efficiency for each point mutant strongly suggests that the major
role of FIH-Gln239 is to stabilize the proper rotamer of
CTAD-Asn803 that can undergo hydroxylation during turnover.

The kinetic data further suggest that packing near the target residue
may also impact O2 activation in FIH. The overall trend
in the kinetic parameters measured by coupled turnover (Table ) was dominated by bulk, as the kinetic parameters
for the Gln239 → X point variants decreased monotonically
in a series: X = (Ala &gt; Asn &gt; Glu and His ≫ Leu). As
the kinetic
parameters of the variants listed in Table  are functions of all steps leading to CTAD hydroxylation, it is
not possible to separately identify the impact of the variants on
O2 activation. However, the coupling data directly measured
succinate production (Table ), which reports
directly on O2 activation. The rates of succinate production
clearly showed that each variant produced succinate much more slowly
that WT-FIH, suggesting that O2 activation was slowed in
these variants. As the packing about CTAD-Asn803 is quite
tight in WT-FIH, it is possible that
the Gln239 → X variants excluded CTAD-Asn803 from the proper conformation, which could impede access of O2 to the Fe(II) as well as hydroxylation by the putative ferryl
intermediate (Scheme ).

Conclusion
This work establishes that proper positioning of the primary substrate
(CTAD) is required to support coupled turnover by FIH. We conclude
that proper positioning of substrate is crucial for the hydroxylation
of CTAD as well as for stimulation of O2 activation. Mispositioned
CTAD impedes O2 activation, suggesting that the environment
near the Fe(II) cofactor plays a marked role in O2 activation.
