Organic anion
transporting polypeptides
(OATPs, gene symbol SLCO) are solute carrier superfamily
members that mediate the sodium-independent transport of a wide range
of amphipathic organic compounds including bile acids, steroid conjugates,
thyroid hormones, anionic peptides, numerous drugs, and other xenobiotic
substances., Among the 11 human OATPs, OATP1B1 is one
of two liver-specific OATPs. It is a glycoprotein of 691 amino acids
with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 84 kDa and 12 putative
transmembrane domains. Under normal physiological
conditions, this transporter seems to be exclusively expressed at
the basolateral membrane of human hepatocytes and plays a pivotal role in the uptake of numerous drugs including
statins and sartans from the portal and systemic blood into hepatocytes., Several studies have shown the possible involvement of OATP1B1 in
drug–drug interactions. For example, in organ transplant patients,
the OATP1B1 inhibitor cyclosporine A increased the mean AUC of fluvastatin, pravastatin, and
rosuvastatin, which are all substrates
of OATP1B1. Pharmacogenomic correlation studies revealed that the SLCO1B1 c.521 T &gt; C SNP was associated
with myopathy in 85 patients who were taking 80 mg of simvastatin
daily. Thus, OATP1B1 can be the cause
of interindividual variance in drug pharmacokinetics, and it could
be used as an effective target for rational drug design to improve
lack of drug efficacy or prevent adverse side effects.

Computer-based
in silico approaches have become powerful tools
to virtually predict transporter–ligand interactions., They can be performed from two different perspectives: either ligand-based
or transporter-based. With respect to the ligand-based method for
substrates of OATP1B1, a pharmacophore model was generated with published Km values, and it demonstrated that the key molecular
features for substrate transporter interactions appeared to be two
hydrogen bond acceptors at either end of a large hydrophobic area. Similar structure requirements for OATP1B1 substrates
were also derived from comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA)
on the basis of competitive inhibitors of estradiol-17β-glucuronide. In contrast, transporter protein-based methods
for OATP1B1 are currently limited because there is no high resolution
crystal structure available. As an alternative, homology models for
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1 have been generated based on the known
structure of bacterial major facilitator superfamily transporters.− On the basis of these models, several groups using chimeric proteins
and site-directed mutagenesis have identified transmembrane (TM) domains
2, 6, 8, 9, and 10 to be important for proper function of OATP1B1.− Furthermore, positive amino acid residues R57, K361, and R580 seem
to be part of the substrate binding and/or translocation pathways
in OATP1B1. In addition, a recent report
showed that amino acids at positions 45, 545, and 615 in OATP1B1 are
crucial for substrate recognition. When these amino acids were replaced
by the corresponding amino acids found in OATP1B3, OATP1B1 was able
to transport the OATP1B3-selective substrate cholecystokinin 8. In the present study, we focused on TM10 of
OATP1B1 and performed cysteine scanning mutagenesis to determine accessibility
and potential involvement of individual amino acid positions in the
substrate binding site/translocation pathway. The results of this
study will help to better understand the multispecificity of OATP1B1
and eventually help in predicting and preventing adverse drug–drug
interactions.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
Radiolabeled
[3H]estrone-3-sulfate
(57.3 Ci/mmol) and [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide
(46.9 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Perkin-Elmer (Boston, MA). Unlabeled
estrone-3-sulfate and estradiol-17β-glucuronide were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Unlabeled valsartan, MTSES, and
[2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide
(MTSET) were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (North
York, Ontario, Canada). Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and maleimide-PEG2-biotin were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford,
IL). The polyclonal anti-His antibody was purchased from Covance (Princeton,
IL), whereas the monoclonal antibody to detect Na+/K+ ATPase α subunit was purchased from Abcam (Boston,
MA).

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
The previously described
human OATP1B1*1b with a six His-tag at the C-terminal end in the pcDNA5/FRT
vector was used for all experiments. Site-directed
mutations were performed with the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers containing the codon
for cysteine (either TGT or TGC) flanked by 18 perfectly matching
nucleotides on both sides. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing.

Cell Culture and Transfection
Human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells were grown as previously described. HEK293 cells were plated at 250 000 cells/well on
24-well plates for transport assays or at 1 250 000
cells/well on six-well plates for surface biotinylation. Twenty-four
hours later, OATP1B1 and the respective cysteine mutants were transiently
transfected using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), and 48 h later the transfected
cells were used for the assays.

Transport Assay
Uptake was performed according to a
previously published method. Briefly,
HEK293 cells were carefully washed with prewarmed uptake buffer (142
mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.5 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 12.5 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4) and then incubated with 200 μL of uptake buffer containing
substrate for the indicated time periods at 37 °C. Uptake was
stopped by removing the substrate solution and washing the cells with
ice-cold uptake buffer. To determine uptake of [3H]estrone-3-sulfate
and [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide, the cells were
then solubilized with 300 μL of 1% Triton X-100 per well and
200 μL were used for liquid scintillation counting. From the
remaining lysate, protein concentration was determined for each well
using the BCA protein assay kit. For the uptake of valsartan, the
cells in each well were treated with 135 μL of 7.5 mM ammonium
formate (pH 5.0)/acetonitrile/methanol = 2:1:1 by volume containing
15 μL of losartan (100 ng/mL, analytical internal standard)
for 20 min at room temperature with constant agitation. After centrifugation,
the supernatants were subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. Cells transfected
with the empty vector served as background control in all experiments.
Kinetic experiments were performed under initial linear rate conditions.
To calculate transporter-specific uptake, the values obtained with
empty vector transfected cells were subtracted from the values obtained
with cells transfected with OATP1B1 or its mutants, and the resulting
uptake values were normalized for surface expression levels of the
constructs. When the effects of MTSES or MTSET were investigated,
cells were pretreated with uptake buffer in the absence or presence
of 10 mM MTSES or 10 mM MTSET for 10 min at 37 °C.

Cell Surface
Biotinylation and Western Blotting
Cell
surface biotinylation was performed essentially following a published
procedure. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
HEK293 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS,
pH 7.4) and treated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.4)
for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were lysed and the biotinylated proteins
were captured using NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce Biotechnology), and
after centrifugation the biotinylated proteins were recovered by incubating
the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer containing 50 mM DTT for 30
min at room temperature. Samples were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
OATP1B1 and its cysteine mutants were detected using a polyclonal
anti-His antibody (1:2500 dilution), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000 dilution). Na+/K+-ATPase was used as loading control for normalization and was detected
with a mouse anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α subunit
antibody (1:5000 dilution). ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway,
NL) was used for detection. Protein band intensities were quantified
with the Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA).

Maleimide Biotinylation
Forty-eight hours after transfection,
HEK293 cells were washed with prewarmed uptake buffer (37 °C,
pH 7.4) and then incubated with either uptake buffer alone or uptake
buffer containing 10 mM MTSES or 10 mM MTSES and 1 mM estrone-3-sulfate
or 10 mM MTSES and 0.75 mM estradiol-17β-glucuronide for 10
min at 37 °C to label the accessible cysteines. Then, cells were
washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0) and treated
with maleimide-PEG2-biotin (0.5 mg/mL in PBS, pH 7.0) for
1 h at 4 °C. The biotinylated protein was captured using NeutrAvidin
beads and then recovered from the beads by boiling with 2× Laemmli
buffer containing 50 mM DTT for 5 min. Samples were separated using
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and after transfer to nitrocellulose
membranes analyzed as described above.

Determination of Valsartan
by LC/MS/MS Analysis
Standard
curves were prepared in the respective cell lysate matrix and used
for each analysis. Losartan was used as analytical internal standard
at a concentration of 10 ng/mL. The LC/MS/MS system consisted of a
Shimadzu LC-20AD (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) and a Waters
Quattro Premiere mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA).
The desolvation gas (nitrogen) flow rate was 650 L/h, the cone gas
(nitrogen) flow rate was 60 L/h, the source temperature was 120 °C,
and the desolvation temperature was 350 °C.

The mass spectrometer
was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode using positive ion
electrospray (ESI). The valsartan product ion was formed using a capillary
energy of 2.5 kV and a cone energy of 30 V. Product ion formed at
the collision energy of 22 eV (m/z 436.39 → 207.20) was monitored. The mobile phase used for
high-performance liquid chromatography was 7.5 mM ammonium formate
(pH 5.0)/acetonitrile/methanol = 2:1:1 by volume, and the flow rate
was 0.5 mL/min. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Luna
C-18 column (5 μm, 50 × 2 mm) fitted with a C18 guard column
(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA).

Data Analysis
Statistical significance
was calculated
using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test,
and P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant (SigmaPlot
12.0, Systat Software, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). To obtain apparent Km and Vmax values,
nonlinear regression analysis was performed, and the experimental
data were plotted using Eadie–Hofstee plots.

Results
To determine to what extent cysteine replacement of the amino acids
in TM10 (Figure ) would affect the functional
activity of OATP1B1, wild-type OATP1B1 and each of the cysteine mutants
were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Figure A demonstrates that most mutants were able to mediate uptake
of both OATP-model substrates estrone-3-sulfate and estradiol-17β-glucuronide.
Transport of each substrate was negligible in each of the mutants
F534C, F537C, Q541C, and A549C. Surface expression analysis (Figure B) revealed that F534C and F537C were not expressed
at the surface. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates demonstrated
that mutants F534C and F537C were synthesized as unglycosylated proteins
of 60 kDa instead of 84 kDa (data not shown) suggesting that these
two mutations affect protein stability, folding, and/or trafficking,
and they were omitted from further analysis. In contrast, although
Q541C and A549C did only show minimal substrate uptake (less than
20% of estrone-3-sulfate transport and less than 2% of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
transport of wild-type OATP1B1), their surface expression levels were
comparable to wild-type OATP1B1. However, because of their overall
low transport function, these two mutants were also omitted from further
analysis. Because surface expression of the different mutants after
correction with the loading control Na+/K+ ATPase
was variable, all further functional results were corrected for their
surface expression levels. Compared to wild-type OATP1B1 cysteine
mutants of amino acid residues in the second half of TM10 (Figure ) showed overall reduced substrate transport (Figure C). Mutating G551 to a cysteine residue resulted
in about a 2-fold increase in estrogen-3-sulfate uptake compared to
wild-type OATP1B1, while estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake was
not affected.

are indicated with black circles.

Substrate transport and surface expression of OATP1B1 and the TM10
cysteine mutants. (A) Uptake of 0.1 μM [3H]estrone-3-sulfate
(black bars) or 1 μM [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide
(gray bars) was measured with HEK293 cells transfected with empty
vector, OATP1B1, or 34 cysteine mutants at 37 °C for 30 s (estrone-3-sulfate)
or 2 min (estradiol-17β-glucuronide), respectively. After the
values obtained with empty vector transfected cells were subtracted,
results were calculated as a percentage of uptake activity for OATP1B1.
Each bar is the mean ± SD of three individual experiments. An
asterisk (*) indicates values significantly different from that of
OATP1B1 (p &lt; 0.05). The amino acid on the left
side (D527) is located close to the predicted extracellular side of
TM10, while the one on the right side (K561) is located at the predicted
cytoplasmic side of TM10. (B) Biotinylated membrane proteins were
subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-His antibody detecting
the C-terminal end of OATP1B1 and the mutant proteins. The plasma
membrane marker Na+/K+ ATPase α subunit
was used as protein loading control. (C) Uptake values shown in (A)
were corrected for protein expression and are given as normalized
uptake. Asterisks (*) indicate values significantly different from
that of OATP1B1 (p &lt; 0.05).

After it was established that most mutants were functional,
the
effect of the negatively charged and membrane impermeable MTSES on
wild-type OATP1B1 and its different cysteine mutants was examined.
Figure A summarizes the results obtained for
estrone-3-sulfate uptake and shows that wild-type OATP1B1 and most
of the tested mutants were not affected, at least for this substrate,
by preincubation with MTSES. Estrone-3-sulfate uptake by R532C, V542C,
L545C, G551C, T553C, and V556C was significantly inhibited by pretreatment
with MTSES. Interestingly, MTSES pretreatment also resulted in stimulation
of estrone-3-sulfate uptake for S548C and G552C. In the case of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake (Figure B), MTSES pretreatment resulted
in reduced uptake for G552C, H555C, and V556C, while uptake by N544C
and L545C was stimulated by 3- and 6-fold, respectively.

Effect of MTSES
on estrone-3-sulfate and estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake by OATP1B1 and its TM10 cysteine mutants. HEK293 cells transfected
with empty vector, OATP1B1, or the cysteine mutants were treated with
uptake buffer (white bars) or 10 mM MTSES (black bars) for 10 min
at 37 °C. After the cells were washed, cell uptake of (A) 0.1
μM [3H]estrone-3-sulfate or (B) 1 μM [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide was measured at 37 °C
for 30 s or for 2 min, respectively. Results were normalized for surface
expression and are presented as percentage of each control. Each bar
is the mean ± SD of three individual experiments. An asterisk
(*) indicates values significantly different from its control (p &lt; 0.05).

Because MTSES affected L545C most strongly, resulting in
inhibition
of estrone-3-sulfate but stimulation of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake, kinetic analyses of both substrates were performed to determine
to what extent apparent affinity and maximal transport rates were
affected by MTSES pretreatment. The Eadie–Hofstee plot in Figure A clearly shows that like wild-type OATP1B1,, mutant L545C exhibits biphasic
transport kinetics of estrone-3-sulfate with a high affinity low capacity
(Km1 = 0.9 μM; Vmax1 = 95.9 pmol/normalized mg/min) and a low affinity
high capacity (Km2 = 15.6 μM; Vmax2 = 298 pmol/normalized mg/min) component
(Table ). However, after pretreatment with
MTSES only a single Km value of 89.7 μM
and a Vmax value of 1018 pmol/normalized
mg/min could be calculated (Table ) indicating
that for estrone-3-sulfate transport the presence of MTSES on L545
affects both apparent binding affinity as well as substrate translocation.
In contrast, the Eadie–Hofstee plot for estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake (Figure B) shows only a single phase
and demonstrates that in the presence of MTSES the apparent affinity
is not changed (Table ), but the Vmax value is increased about 4-fold (Table ).

estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake by L545C in the presence and
absence of MTSES. HEK293 cells transfected with empty vector or L545C
were treated with uptake buffer (black circles) or 10 mM MTSES (white
circles) for 10 min at 37 °C. After the cells were washed, uptake
of (A) [3H]estrone-3-sulfate and (B) [3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide
was measured with increasing substrate concentrations (0.02–500
μM for estrone-3-sulfate and 1–50 μM for estradiol-17β-glucuronide)
at 37 °C for 20 s (estrone-3-sulfate) or 1 min (estradiol-17β-glucuronide).
Net uptake was calculated by subtracting the values obtained with
empty vector transfected cells from L545C-expressing cells and normalized
for surface expression. Each value is the mean ± SD of three
individual experiments. Lines were drawn using the Enzyme kinetics
function of SIGMAPLOT 12.

To more directly test whether L545 is involved in
substrate binding,
we tested whether MTSES-labeling of L545C could be protected by the
presence of substrate using maleimide biotinylation. In these experiments,
cells transfected with empty vector, wild-type OATP1B1, or mutant
L545C were treated with maleimide-PEG2-biotin for 1 h at
4 °C after having been preincubated with uptake buffer (Figure ; Control) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell lysates
were then treated with NeutrAvidin beads, and after a centrifugation
step bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using
an anti-His antibody. If a free cysteine residue of the transporter
was available, maleimide biotinylation would result in a band on the
Western blot. As can be seen in Figure  (control),
only mutant L545C reacts with maleimide-biotin, confirming that none
of the cysteine residues present in wild-type OATP1B1 are accessible
to maleimide and therefore suggesting that all extracellular cysteine
residues form disulfide bonds or are otherwise inaccessible. However,
after replacing the leucine residue at position 545 with a cysteine,
this cysteine residue is accessible to maleimide-biotin and a band
can be seen on the Western blot. Cells were also treated with maleimide-biotin
after a preincubation with 10 mM MTSES (Figure , MTSES), a mixture of 10 mM MTSES and 1 mM estrone-3-sulfate (Figure , MTSES + E3S), or a mixture of 10 mM MTSES and
0.75 mM estradiol-17β-glucuronide (Figure , MTSES + E17βG). Maleimide biotinylation of L545C was completely
prevented by preincubation with MTSES, indicating that L545C indeed
reacted with MTSES. Simultaneous preincubation of MTSES with estrone-3-sulfate,
fully restored maleimide biotinylation of L545C to the control level,
suggesting that estrone-3-sulfate protected MTSES labeling of L545C.
However, protection of MTSES labeling was not observed with estradiol-17β-glucuronide,
whose transport was actually stimulated in the presence of MTSES.

Effect
of MTSES, estrone-3-sulfate, and estradiol-17β-glucuronide
on maleimide labeling of L545C. Empty vector, OATP1B1, and L545C transfected
HEK 293 cells were preincubated with uptake buffer (control), 10 mM
MTSES (MTSES), a mixture of 10 mM MTSES and 1 mM estrone-3-sulfate
(MTSES + E3S), or a mixture of 10 mM MTSES and 0.75 mM estradiol-17β-glucuronide
(MTSES + E17βG) for 10 min at 37 °C to react and thus label
the accessible cysteine residue with MTSES. After the cells were washed,
they were treated with maleimide-PEG2-biotin for 1 h at
4 °C. Then, cell lysates were reacted with NeutrAvidin, and bound
proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with an anti-His
antibody.

To test whether the observed effects
were due to the negative charge
introduced by MTSES or a steric effect of MTSES, we treated cells
expressing wild-type OATP1B1 and certain mutants with the positively
charged and membrane impermeable MTSET. The results are summarized
in Figure  and demonstrate that estrone-3-sulfate
uptake of mutant L545C was also strongly inhibited by MTSET (Figure A), indicating that MTSES and MTSET have more likely
a steric effect than an effect due to the charge of the modifying
reagent. Similarly, MTSET slightly inhibited estrone-3-sulfate uptake
of G551C and V556C as did MTSES (Figure A).
However, in contrast to MTSES, there was no inhibition of estrone-3-sulfate
uptake by MTSET treatment of T553C. Furthermore, while MTSES treatment
of S548C and H555C did not affect estrone-3-sulfate uptake and treatment
of G552C resulted in a stimulation of uptake, treatment of all three
mutants with MTSET resulted in inhibition. For estradiol-17β-glucuronide,
MTSET treatment had either no effect (N544C and V556C) or inhibited
uptake (L545C, G552C, and H555C) but did not stimulate as MTSES (Figure B). Mutants G552C and H555C were affected in a similar
way because both MTSES and MTSET inhibited estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake.

Comparison of the effect of MTSES and of MTSET on estrone-3-sulfate
and estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake by OATP1B1 and selected
TM10 cysteine mutants. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty
vector, OATP1B1, and its cysteine mutants were treated with uptake
buffer (white bars), 10 mM MTSES (black bars), or 10 mM MTSET (gray
bars) for 10 min at 37 °C. After the cells were washed, uptake
of (A) 0.1 μM [3H]estrone-3-sulfate or (B) 1 μM
[3H]estradiol-17β-glucuronide was measured at 37
°C for 30 s or for 2 min, respectively. Results were normalized
for surface expression and are presented as the percentage of each
control. Each bar is the mean ± SD of three (MTSES and MTSET)
or six (control) individual experiments. An asterisk (*) indicates
values significantly different from its control (p &lt; 0.05).

The results presented
so far strongly suggest that L545 might be
part of the estrone-3-sulfate binding site/translocation pathway,
and thus that leucine at position 545 is crucial for proper estrone-3-sulfate
transport. Therefore, we replaced leucine at position 545 with random
amino acids and compared the uptake of estrone-3-sulfate of these
mutants with wild-type OATP1B1 (Figure ).
We used PROVEAN and SNAP, two algorithms available online that predict
the effect amino acid replacements have on the biological function
of proteins. Although both algorithms predicted all the tested replacements
to be neutral, estrone-3-sulfate uptake was strongly reduced for all
but the asparagine replacement, supporting the conclusion that L545
is important for OATP1B1-mediated estrone-3-sulfate transport.

Effect of random
mutagenesis of L545 on OATP1B1-mediated estrone-3-sulfate
uptake. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector,
OATP1B1, or some randomly generated mutants. Uptake of 0.1 μM
[3H]estrone-3-sulfate was measured for 1 min at 37 °C,
and results for empty vector transfected cells were subtracted from
OATP1B1 or mutant expressing cells. Results are given as means ±
SD of three individual experiments. An asterisk (*) indicates values
significantly different from OATP1B1 (p &lt; 0.05).

Because it has been reported that
OATP1B1 can transport valsartan, we used
valsartan as a model drug substrate
and determined the uptake of valsartan by cysteine mutants from N544
to V556 because mutants in this range showed effects for estrone-3-sulfate
and estradiol-17β-glucuronide transport. As can be seen from
Figure A, all mutants were able to transport
valsartan, even A549C which transported less than 20% of estrone-3-sulfate
and estradiol-17β-glucuronide when compared to wild-type OATP1B1
showed a similar valsartan uptake as OATP1B1 (Figure A). We pretreated the mutants with MTSES or MTSET to test
whether transport of this commonly used drug would be similarly affected
by cysteine modifications and whether there would be charge effects.
MTSES pretreatment reduced uptake of mutants L545C, A549C, G551C,
G552C, and H555C (Figure B, black bars). Similarly,
MTSET pretreatment did not stimulate valsartan uptake (Figure B, gray bars). In contrast to MTSES pretreatment,
mutant H555C was not affected by MTSET pretreatment, suggesting that
the effect of MTSES at this amino acid position is possibly a charge
effect. All other mutants were inhibited (L545C and A549C) or tended
to be inhibited (G551C and G552C) by MTSET, suggesting that these
effects were steric rather than charge-dependent. When comparing the
amino acid residues that, when pretreated with MTSES, resulted in
inhibition or stimulation of transport of the three tested substrates
(Figure ), it becomes clear that the different
substrates need a similar but not identical set of residues within
TM10 with which they interact.

Effect of cysteine mutation and MTSES
or MTSET treatment on valsartan
uptake mediated by OATP1B1 and its TM10 cysteine mutants. HEK293 cells
were transiently transfected with empty vector, OATP1B1, and its cysteine
mutants. (A) Uptake of 1 μM valsartan was measured for 8 min
at 37 °C by LC/MS/MS, and results are given as percentage of
uptake activity for OATP1B1. (B) Cells were treated with uptake buffer
or 10 mM MTSES for 10 min at 37 °C. After the cells were washed,
uptake of 1 μM valsartan was measured for 8 min at 37 °C
by LC/MS/MS. Results were normalized for surface expression and are
presented as the percentage of each control. Each bar is the mean
± SD of three individual experiments. An asterisk (*) indicates
values significantly different from its control (p &lt; 0.05).

in TM10 of OATP1B1. Residues where MTSES inhibited estrone-3-sulfate
(E3S), estradiol-17β-glucuronide (E17βG), or valsartan
are labeled blue; residues where MTSES stimulated substrate uptake
are labeled red.

Discussion
In
this study, we used cysteine scanning mutagenesis of TM10 in
OATP1B1 to determine accessibility and potential involvement of the
mutated amino acid residues in the substrate binding site/translocation
pathway. Our data indicate that estrone-3-sulfate, estradiol-17β-glucuronide,
and valsartan are transported by OATP1B1 using overlapping but not
mutually exclusive binding sites/translocations pathways.

MTSES
as well as MTSET preincubation of wild-type OATP1B1 did not
affect transport of estrone-3-sulfate, estradiol-17β-glucuronide,
or valsartan, indicating that similar to OATP2B1 all extracellular cysteine residues form disulfide bonds
and cannot react with these cysteine reactive reagents or that reaction
with existing cysteines does not affect the function. In addition,
most of the 34 mutants were not affected by MTSES pretreatment, and
the mutants that were affected are within the cytoplasmic half of
the putative TM10.

Although transport of the three substrates
was affected by MTSES
labeling of very similar amino acid positions (Figure ), there were clear differences. The most prominent difference
was that labeling of L545C by MTSES inhibited estrone-3-sulfate and
valsartan uptake but stimulated transport of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
(Figures A,B and B).
Because the compelling inhibition of estrone-3-sufate and stimulation
of estradiol-17β-glucuronide, we performed kinetics for these
two substrates. For estrone-3-sulfate, kinetic analyses revealed that
the mutant L545C exhibited biphasic kinetics (Figure A, Table ) similar to the wild-type
OATP1B1.,, However, after
labeling with MTSES, both the apparent Km value and the Vmax value increased,
and the data could no longer be fitted to biphasic but only to monophasic
kinetics. Thus, pretreatment with MTSES resulted in a transporter
that when compared to wild-type OATP1B1 had a lower affinity and a
higher capacity to transport estrone-3-sulfate. When we previously
compared OATP1B1 with OATP1B3 with respect to estrone-3-sulfate transport,
OATP1B3 was the transporter with the lower affinity and higher capacity. Therefore, MTSES pretreatment of the OATP1B1
L545C mutant converts this transport protein into a functional OATP1B3,
at least with respect to estrone-3-sulate uptake. Whether the same
is true for other substrates will have to be determined in future
studies. The importance of L545 for estrone-3-sulfate uptake was already
documented previously, and more recent
findings extended this for the OATP1B3 specific substrate cholecystokinin
8. When the three amino acids at positions 45, 545, and 615 in OATP1B1
were replaced by their OATP1B3 counterparts, OATP1B1 was able to transport
cholecystokinin 8, further supporting
the importance of L545 for OATP1B1 transport.

The suggestion
that L545 might be part of the estrone-3-sulfate
binding site/translocation pathway was confirmed by maleimide labeling
experiments that demonstrated protection of MTSES labeling by estrone-3-sulfate
but not by estradiol-17β-glucuronide (Figure ) and by the fact that MTSES labeling changed the apparent
affinity for estrone-3-sulfate transport, although it did not affect
the apparent affinity for estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake (Table ).

Kinetic analysis performed for estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake of L545C revealed that the apparent Km value of 19.4 μM (Table ) was
higher than the values (3.8–9.7 μM) reported previously,,− suggesting that the cysteine at this position might have an effect
on estradiol-17β-glucuronide binding. However, there was no
further effect of MTSES pretreatment on apparent affinity. Nevertheless,
treatment with MTSES increased the maximal transport rate of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake by about 4-fold (Vmax of 167 pmol/normalized
mg/min in control versus Vmax of 618 pmol/normalized
mg/min in MTSES), suggesting that the stimulation of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake could be due to accelerated translocation of the substrate
through OATP1B1 perhaps by facilitating interaction of the substrate
with the protein in an optimal configuration due to the negative charge
of MTSES. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that treatment
with the cationic MTSET inhibited estradiol-17β-glucuronide
uptake by about 60% (Figure B), indicating
that indeed the negative charge of MTSES contributed to the marked
stimulation of estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake by L545C and
that the positive charge attached to the protein through MTSET hinders
such an optimized configuration of estradiol-17β-glucuronide
within the binding pocket of OATP1B1. An alternative explanation would
be that the additional positive charge brought into the presumable
binding pocket that already contains several important positively
charged amino acids would increase the binding strength for negatively
charged substrates and lead to an inhibition of transport via an increase
in the apparent affinity as for example seen for mutations at position
R580 for estradiol-17β-glucuronide, estrone-3-sulfate, and bromosulfophthalein
uptake. However, because the apparent
affinity is not affected, L545 does not seem to be close to the estradiol-17β-glucuronide
binding site (translocation pathway). A similar but less pronounced
stimulation/inhibition of the different substrates was observed with
mutant G552C. While MTSES labeling stimulated estrone-3-sulfate uptake,
it inhibited uptake of estradiol-17β-glucuronide and valsartan
(Figures AB and B).

Mutant A549C which showed dramatically reduced estrone-3-sulfate
and estradiol-17β-glucuronide transport (Figure ) had normal transport of valsartan (Figure ). Pretreatment with MTSES as well as with MTSET resulted
in a very strong inhibition of valsartan uptake. Besides amino acids
affecting more than one substrate, we also identified residues that
only affected transport of one of the three substrates: labeling of
N544C with MTSES stimulated estradiol-17β-glucuronide uptake
but did not affect transport of estron-3-sulfate (Figure ) or valsartan (data not shown) uptake. Taken together,
these results demonstrate clearly that a set of common but not identical
amino acids are involved in the substrate binding sites/translocation
pathways for the different OATP1B1 substrates.

In conclusion,
our results demonstrate that several amino acids
in the cytoplasmic half of TM10 of OATP1B1 are part of the substrate
binding site/translocation pathway. While none of the three tested
substrates is handled in the exact same way, this study identified
five amino acids that are particularly important for the transport
of all the three substrates. Among these, the leucine at position
545 seems to be part of the estrone-3-sulfate binding site/translocation
pathway. Thus, the present study provides novel insight toward a better
understanding of the multispecificity of OATP1B1 at the molecular
level.
