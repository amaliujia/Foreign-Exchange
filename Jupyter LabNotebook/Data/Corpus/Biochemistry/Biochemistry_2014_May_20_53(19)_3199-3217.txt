Ubiquitination,
covalent attachment
of the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin to target proteins, controls
a wide array of cellular functions, including protein quality control,
cell cycle progression, transcription, endocytosis, DNA repair, and
cellular signaling.− Ubiquitin is attached to target proteins via an isopeptide bond
linking the side-chain amino group of lysine residues of the target
to the terminal carboxylate group of ubiquitin (Gly76). This modification
is allowed by the sequential catalytic activity of three enzymatic
systems: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase)., The more widely
understood form of ubiquitination involves the attachment of a polyubiquitin
chain in which successive ubiquitin groups are linked to one of the
seven lysines, or the N-terminal amino group of the preceding monomer,
to generate homopolymeric structures of one of eight linkage types.
Polyubiquitin chains of distinct three-dimensional architecture are
thus generated depending on which amino group of ubiquitin is used
for chain extension (lysine 6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48, or 63 or the amino
group of Met1). A polyubiquitin chain of a given linkage type signifies
a specific type of functional outcome.,− For example, Lys48 (K48)-linked chains and, to some extent, K11-linked
chains usually serve as the signal for proteasomal degradation, whereas
K63 chains signal other types of functions, such as DNA repair, endosomal–lysosomal
sorting, and NF-κB signaling.,

Ubiquitination
is a reversible post-translational modification
like phosphorylation. Deubiquitinating enzymes, or DUBs, can hydrolytically
remove ubiquitin from protein adducts to counteract ubiquitination.
Accordingly, DUBs are known to play key regulatory roles in numerous
cellular processes that rely on ubiquitination., The human genome encodes approximately 100 DUBs, and most of their
biological functions are yet to be determined. They can be grouped
into five major families based on the structure of their catalytic
domain: ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal
hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian tumor proteases (OTUs), JAB1/MPN/MOV34
metalloenzymes (JAMMs), and Machado-Josephin domain proteases (MJDs)., Mechanistically, these enzymes can be divided into two main groups:
cysteine proteases and zinc metalloproteases. The zinc metalloproteases
consist of only one family, the JAMMs, whereas the other four families
are cysteine proteases.,,

The JAMM family of metallo DUBs is mechanistically related
to the
well-known metalloprotease thermolysin, despite having sequences substantially
different from that of thermolysin. Generally, the active sites of
thermolysin-like metalloproteases contain a Zn2+ ion coordinated
by two histidines, an aspartate (or a glutamate), and a water molecule.
The water molecule is held in place by hydrogen bonding with a different
glutamate residue from the second coordination sphere, in addition
to the metal ion, and acts as the nucleophile during the hydrolysis
reaction.,− Of the 14 JAMM proteins
in the human genome, only seven contain a complete set of conserved
residues needed for Zn2+ coordination in the active site,
six of which, AMSH, AMSH-LP (AMSH-like protein), BRCC36, RPN11 (POH1),
MYSM1, and CSN5, are known to have isopeptidase activity toward proteins
conjugated to ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers.,,,−

Endocytic sorting of cell-surface receptors to lysosomes for
their
degradation is executed by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes
required for transport) machinery, which consists of four different
macromolecular assemblies, ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III., Internalized receptors (cargo) are ubiquitinated in their cytosolic
parts by attachment of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which then
serve as a signal for subsequent sorting and delivery of cargo to
lysosomes via the multivesicular bodies (MVB) pathway., Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to receptors are required
for their binding to the ESCRT machinery, whose members shuttle the
cargo and package it into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in MVBs (endosomes
carrying ILVs are known as MVBs). The ESCRT members appear to play
distinct roles in this sorting process. ESCRT-0 clusters ubiquitinated
cargo on early endosomes and subsequently passes it to the next member,
ESCRT-I, which is responsible for recruiting ESCRT-II. ESCRT-I and
-II work in tandem to bend the membrane, creating membrane buds, while
ensuring that the cargo is confined to these newly formed buds. In
the final step of cargo sorting, components of ESCRT-III assemble
at bud necks to catalyze the scission process, whereby the newly formed
vesicles carrying cargo are released into the lumen of the endosome.,− Subsequently, these newly formed ILVs fuse with the
lysosome, delivering the cargo for its destruction. It is important
to note that the cargo is deubiquitinated prior to its sequestration
into ILVs to spare ubiquitin from being destroyed in the process.
Accordingly, certain members of ESCRT-III feature binding domains
for recruiting AMSH and USP8 (also known as UBPY), the two mammalian
DUBs known to regulate endocytic sorting.,,− It is not clear why
two DUBs, one exquisitely specific for the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin
chain (AMSH) and the other with no specificity (USP8), are chosen
for this task. Interestingly, in mammals, the initial complex, ESCRT-0,
can also recruit both DUBs, the functional significance of which remains
to be elucidated. One possibility is
that recruitment of AMSH might be required for shortening polyubiquitin
chains, so that the cargo can be passed easily from ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-I
and -II, a necessity arising because the latter two complexes manifest
affinity for the polyubiquitin chain weaker than that of ESCRT-0.
The chain shortening action of AMSH is consistent with its high selectivity
for Lys63-linked chains; it can disassemble Lys63-linked chains but
perhaps cannot remove ubiquitin completely from the cargo. In contrast,
the recruitment of USP8 at the ESCRT-0 stage might lead to complete
deubiquitination of the cargo, resulting in its falling off from the
ESCRT complexes. This would likely facilitate its recycling back to
the plasma membrane.,

Our laboratory has been
interested in understanding the role AMSH
plays at the ESCRT-0 stage in regulating endocytic sorting. So far,
we have determined the structure of AMSH and established a mechanism
of its activation upon binding to the STAM component of ESCRT-0. Specifically,
using site-directed mutants, we have shown recently that the UIM domain
of STAM, abutting its SH3 domain that it uses to bind to AMSH, could
facilitate catalysis by binding to the proximal ubiquitin of a diubiquitin
substrate. (In diubiquitin, a lysine
residue of one ubiquitin, called the proximal ubiquitin, is covalently
attached to the last carboxylate group, Gly76, of the other ubiquitin,
called the distal ubiquitin.) Such a mode of binding could lead to
catalytic activation of the DUB upon its association with ESCRT-0.
We wish to provide structural data in support of the biochemical evidence
with the hopes of clearly establishing the mechanism underlying the
recruitment and activation of AMSH at ESCRT-0. For this reason, we
purified a ternary complex consisting of a catalytically inactive
construct of Sst2, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe orthologue
of AMSH, the UIM-SH3 construct representing STAM, and the Lys63-linked
diubiquitin substrate with the aim of crystallizing it. Although we
are yet to crystallize the ternary complex, our efforts in this direction
so far have yielded cocrystal structures of the enzyme bound to diubiquitin,
its substrate, and bound to ubiquitin, its product. Our structural
analysis provides important insights into the mode of substrate recognition
and shows that one of the products of the diubiquitin substrate, that
is the distal ubiquitin, can remain tightly bound to the enzyme after
the hydrolysis reaction, as the carboxylate group of ubiquitin’s
Gly76 is coordinated to the active-site metal and is also hydrogen-bonded
with the conserved glutamate that is used for holding the nucleophilic
water. These product specific interactions appear to offset the contribution
of the proximal ubiquitin in a diubiquitin substrate, thus explaining
the close correspondence between the affinity for the product and
that for the substrate (the dissociation constant with ubiquitin rivals
the Michaelis constant, KM, for the Lys63-linked
diubiquitin substrate). It is thus likely that the cytosolic form
of AMSH, and by extrapolation similar JAMM DUBs, would be bound to
ubiquitin and exist in an inhibited state.

Methods
Cloning, Expression,
and Purification
Full length Sst2
and the UIM-SH3 domains of HseI (STAM orthologue of S. pombe) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the S.
pombe cDNA library (a kind gift from K. Gould, Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, TN). The catalytic domain of Sst2 (residues
245–435), here termed Sst2cat, and a longer construct
of Sst2 (residues 221–435) containing the putative SH3 binding
motif (SBM), here termed Sst2Δ220, were both subcloned
into pGEX-6P1 vectors using standard cloning protocols. The DNA encoding
the UIM-SH3 domains of HseI was subcloned into the pGEX-6P1 vector.
Human ubiquitin was also subcloned into a pGEX-6P1 vector. The resulting
recombinant DNA constructs were transformed into Escherichia
coli Rosetta cells to be expressed as a recombinant protein
fused with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag
at their N-termini and purified as described. Six liters of Luria-Bertani
cultures was grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 600
nm reached 0.4–0.6 and then induced with 0.1–0.3 mM
isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to allow overexpression
of the protein at 18 °C overnight. The next day, the cells were
centrifuged at 8630g for 10 min at 4 °C and
the pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
400 mM KCl. Lysozyme was added to the suspension, which was then lysed
via a French press. The lysate was centrifuged at 22000g for 45 min at 4 °C to remove the cellular debris. The supernatant
was further clarified by centrifugation again at 100000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The GST-tagged protein was purified using
a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. After removal of the GST tag with PreScission protease (GE
Biosciences), the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) in a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 1
mM DTT (pH 7.6) using a Superdex S75 column (GE Biosciences). All
protein samples were concentrated, and the final concentrations were
measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Samples were flash-frozen
and stored at −80 °C until they were used.

Glu286Ala,
Asp354Ala, and Thr319Ile mutations were introduced individually into
the Sst2cat construct by site-directed mutagenesis following
the standard protocol. Additionally, the Glu286Ala, Asp354Ala, Tyr234Val,
Thr235Asp, and Glu239Lys point mutations were all introduced sequentially
into the Sst2Δ220 construct (this construct therefore
contains five mutations). The presence of these mutations was confirmed
by DNA sequencing. The resulting GST-tagged mutants were expressed
in E. coli and purified following the purification
methods described above.

To avoid issues that may arise as a
result of an N-terminal pentapeptide
cloning artifact from ubiquitin prepared via GST affinity chromatography,
ubiquitin was prepared from a pRSETA plasmid (gift from P. Loll, Drexel
University, Philadelphia, PA) for isothermal titration calorimetry
experiments. After cells had been induced with 300 μM IPTG at
an OD600 ranging from 0.4 to 0.6, expression was conducted
overnight at 18 °C. Cells were harvested at 3570g, and pellets were resuspended in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5).
The suspension was lysed via two rounds of a French press, and the
lysate was heated to 80 °C for 5 min before centrifugation at
100000g for 1 h. The lysate was loaded onto a column
containing SP-Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated
in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5), and ubiquitin was eluted by applying
a step gradient with 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 1 M NaCl. Ubiquitin
was further purified by size exclusion chromatography in a buffer
consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT using
a Superdex S75 column (GE Biosciences).

Lys63-linked diubiquitin
was synthesized enzymatically according
to published methods using Lys63Arg and
Asp77 ubiquitin mutants, with some modifications. Human E1, Uev1a,
and Ubc13 and the two mouse ubiquitin mutants were purified separately
and then mixed in a reaction buffer containing 80 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), 20 mM ATP, 20 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. The reactions
were conducted overnight at 37 °C and quenched at room temperature
with a 10-fold excess of buffer A [50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5)].
To separate synthesized diubiquitin from unreacted ubiquitin, the
quenched reactions were loaded onto a MonoS cation exchange column
(GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A and eluted using a
linear gradient with buffer B [50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 1
M NaCl]. Diubiquitin was concentrated and stored at −80 °C
until it was used. For one of our crystallography experiments, we
also used a form of Lys63-linked diubiquitin that was obtained by
semisynthesis.

Crystallization and Data
Collection
Crystallization
was performed by sitting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature.
Crystals of Sst2cat were grown from the mother liquor containing
0.2 M ammonium phosphate dibasic (pH 8.0) and 20% (w/v) poly(ethylene
glycol) 3350, with either 2.7% (w/v) 1,6-hexanediol or 91 mM glycine
included as an additive. With the help of one of these additives,
the crystals attain their maximal size in 1–5 days. Crystals
of Sst2catT319I grew in 1 week in 0.03 M citric acid, 0.07
M bis-tris propane (pH 7.6), 20% PEG 3350, and 1.8% benzamidine hydrochloride
(additive).

To prepare a complex of Sst2 and ubiquitin, Sst2cat and ubiquitin were mixed in a ratio of 1:1.6. Crystals
of the complex, here termed Sst2cat–Ub, formed at
room temperature in 1 week in 0.2 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate
(pH 8.3) and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. Sst2cat–Ub also
crystallized in 60 days in 0.02 M zinc chloride and 20% (w/v) PEG
3350 (pH 4.5). With the goal of forming a complex between Sst2 and
diubiquitin, Sst2catE286A and Lys63-linked diubiquitin
(synthesized artificially by E. Strieter, University of Wisconsin—Madison)
were mixed in a ratio of 1.5:1 to form the complex. Crystallization
was performed by sitting drop vapor diffusion at room temperature,
and crystals grew in 3 days from the mother liquor containing 0.2
M ammonium phosphate dibasic (pH 8.0) and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. Sst2catD354A and ubiquitin were also mixed in a ratio of 1.8:1
to make the complex. Crystals of the complex, here termed Sst2catD354A–Ub, also formed at room temperature in 1 week
in 1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.05 M HEPES sodium (pH 7.0), and 20% (w/v)
PEG 3350.

The three-protein complex consisting of Sst2Δ220, the UIM-SH3 domain of HseI, and Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub2) was buffer exchanged into 50 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 50 mM NaCl,
and 1 mM DTT. The three-protein complex was formed by first mixing
Sst2Δ220 and the UIM-SH3 domain from HseI to form
an initial complex, which was purified by size exclusion chromatography
on a Superdex S75 column (GE Biosciences). Fractions from the sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
gel corresponding to the Sst2–UIM-SH3 complex were pooled,
concentrated, and complexed with enzymatically synthesized K63-Ub2. This three-protein complex was then purified by size exclusion
chromatography, again on a Superdex S75 column (GE Biosciences). SDS–PAGE
fractions corresponding to the three-protein complex were pooled and
concentrated for crystallography. Initial crystallization experiments
were performed at 20 °C. A Genomics Solutions Cartesian “Honeybee”
963 crystallization robot was used to set up approximately 700 conditions
in a sitting drop format. Large crystals of Sst2 in complex with enzymatically
synthesized diubiquitin (Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2) grew after 1 month at 20 °C from the MCSG-1 crystal
screen (Microlytic) mother liquor containing 0.2 M MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350.

Crystals
were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant solution (20–25%
ethylene glycol) and flash-frozen by being plunged into liquid nitrogen.
Crystals of Sst2cat formed from additive 2.7% (w/v) 1,6-hexanediol
were soaked in 2.5 mM zinc chloride for 45 min and washed with 25%
ethylene glycol, which was also used as the cryoprotectant. Finally,
the crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction
data for Sst2cat, Sst2cat–Ub, and Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2 were collected at 100
K using a Mar300 CCD detector at beamline 23-ID-D, and diffraction
data for Sst2catT319I and Sst2catE286A–Ub
were collected at 100 K using a Mar300 CCD detector at beamline 23-ID-B
at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne,
IL). All data were processed with HKL3000.

Structure Determination and Refinement for Sst2cat in
Its Free Form
Three crystal structures were obtained
for Sst2cat in two space groups. The difference in space
groups resulted from crystals that formed from different additives
in the same mother liquor. Crystals of Sst2cat grown using
glycine as an additive crystallized in the P212121 space group and diffracted to 1.8
Å. Data were collected, and the structure was determined by molecular
replacement with MolRep of the ccp4 suite using the catalytic domain of AMSH-LP as a search model. A homology model for the
catalytic domain of Sst2 was generated on the basis of the crystal
structure of the catalytic domain of AMSH-LP using the SWISS-MODEL
homology modeling server. Crystals of
Sst2cat grown using 1,6-hexanediol as an additive crystallized
in the P21 space group and diffracted
to 1.45 Å. This structure was also determined by molecular replacement
(MR) with MolRep using the Sst2cat structure as a search model. Initial refinements of both structures
were conducted in Refmac5 using rigid
body refinement followed by restrained refinement. The model was built
using Coot, and subsequent rounds of
refinement were conducted in PHENIX,, yielding Rcrys and Rfree values
of 20.2 and 23.8%, respectively, for the P212121 crystal and 16.7 and 19.2%, respectively,
for the P21 crystal. During refinement,
TLS, was also used, with the entire asymmetric
unit taken as one group.

Native Sst2 coordinates two metals,
one in the active site and one serving a structural role away from
the active site. Using crystals of Sst2cat belonging to
the P21 space group, a fluorescence edge
scan was run to detect zinc in the crystal, and data were collected
at a wavelength of 1.283 Å. The crystal diffracted to 1.67 Å,
and the structure was determined using zinc single-wavelength anomalous
dispersion (Zn-SAD). Experimental phasing was performed with AutoSol in the PHENIX suite,, using Phaser to calculate experimental
phases and RESOLVE for density modification
and initial model building, yielding interpretable density in the
experimental map. Subsequent rounds of model building and refinement
were conducted in Coot and PHENIX,, respectively, yielding Rcrys and Rfree values of 17.7 and 21.1%, respectively.
TLS Motion, was used during refinement, using
one group.

Crystals of the MIC-CAP mutant, Sst2catT319I, belong
to the P21 space group and diffracted
to 1.9 Å resolution. Data were collected, and the structure was
determined by MR with MolRep using the
structure of Sst2cat as the search model. After initial
rigid body and restrained refinement with Refmac5, additional rounds of refinement and model building were
conducted as described above, yielding Rcrys and Rfree values of 18.9 and 21.6%,
respectively.

Structure Determination and Refinement of
Sst2cat–Ub-Bound Structures
Sst2cat bound to
ubiquitin (Sst2cat–Ub) crystallized in two different
space groups, arising from different crystallization conditions. The
crystal obtained from 0.2 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate and
20% (w/v) PEG 3350 (pH 8.3) crystallized in the P21 space group and diffracted to 1.97 Å resolution.
After detection of zinc by running a fluorescence edge scan, data
were collected at a wavelength of 1.281 Å using Zn-SAD. The structure
was determined as described above, using AutoSol to generate an experimental map with interpretable density,
allowing cycles of model building and refinement using Coot and PHENIX,, respectively.
The final model yielded Rcrys and Rfree values of 17.7 and 20.7%, respectively.
Crystals of Sst2cat–Ub grown in 0.02 M zinc chloride
and 20% (w/v) PEG crystallized in the P212121 space group and diffracted to 1.63 Å
resolution. Data were collected, and this structure was determined
by MR with MolRep using the Zn-SAD-determined
Sst2cat–Ub structure as a search model. The model
was initially refined in Refmac5 using
rigid body followed by restrained refinement. Rounds of model building
and refinement in Coot and PHENIX, gave Rcrys and Rfree values of 19.5 and 21.5%, respectively. TLS, was used, with one group, during refinement of both structures.

Crystals of Sst2catE286A–Ub, which crystallized
in the P212121 space
group, and Sst2catD354A–Ub, which crystallized in
the P21 space group, diffracted to 1.74
and 2.05 Å resolution, respectively. These structures were also
determined by MR using the previously described Zn-SAD-determined
Sst2cat–Ub structure as a search model. MR, followed
by rounds of refinement and model building, was conducted as described
above. The final models yielded Rcrys and Rfree values for the E286A mutant bound to ubiquitin
of 20.3 and 23.2%, respectively, while the Rcrys and Rfree values for the D354A
mutant bound to ubiquitin were 20.5 and 25.3%, respectively.

Structure
Determination and Refinement of Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2
Crystals of Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2, which crystallized in the P212121 space group, diffracted to
2.3 Å resolution, and the structure was determined by MR using
MolRep of the ccp4 suite using a model generated by superposition of Sst2cat with the structure of AMSH-LP bound to diubiquitin (PDB entry 2ZNV()) as the search model. After superposition of the structures,
AMSH-LP atoms were removed, leaving a model of Sst2 bound to diubiquitin.
The model was built using Coot and refined
using Refmac5, yielding Rcrys and Rfree values of 21.3
and 26.3%, respectively. TLS, was used during structure
refinement in which one group was selected for chain A (Sst2), five
groups were selected for chain B (distal ubiquitin), and three groups
(proximal ubiquitin) were selected for chain C. Optimized weighting
was also applied during structure refinement. All figures for all
structures described were rendered with PYMOL (version 1.7.0.0).

Determination of Kinetic Parameters
The kinetic parameters
were determined as described previously. Briefly, the enzyme (25 nM Sst2cat or 1.25 μM T319I
mutant) was incubated in reaction buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0),
20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT] with four concentrations
of diubiquitin, ranging from 20 to 100 μM. To elucidate initial
rate measurements, these reactions were conducted at 20 °C for
7.5 min (wild type) or 15 min (T319I mutant). We attempted to obtain
initial velocity measurements for the E286A mutant, but no activity
was detected under these conditions. The reactions were quenched by
the addition of 5× SDS–PAGE sample buffer. Because of
ubiquitin aggregation upon boiling, samples were not boiled prior
to being loaded on an SDS–PAGE gel. Bands corresponding to
monoubiquitin were integrated using ImageJ. Ubiquitin standards ranging from 6 to 40 μM were used to draw
calibration plots, which were used to quantify the amount of ubiquitin
produced via the cleavage of diubiquitin. All kinetic data were analyzed
using Kaleidagraph and fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation Vi = (Vmax[S])/(KM + [S]).

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) experiments were conducted at 25 °C to determine
the binding affinity of Sst2 with ubiquitin and diubiquitin using
a GE/MicroCal ITC200 calorimeter. The protein solutions
were dialyzed overnight in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 50 mM NaCl,
exchanging the buffer three times. A typical experiment consisted
of titrating 0.4–1 mM ubiquitin (mono or di) into a 40–50
μM protein solution. A total of 28 injections (1.4 μL/injection)
were performed over the course of an experiment. Each experiment had
a spacing of 180 s between injections that allows for a return to
baseline before the subsequent injection. The data were baseline corrected
by NITPIC and analyzed using a one-site
model from SEDPHAT.

Results
Isolation of
a Sst2–UIM-SH3 Domain–Lys63-Linked
Diubiquitin Ternary Complex
We have previously shown that
an AMSH construct spanning its DUB domain and its N-terminally adjacent
SH3 binding motif (SBM) can be activated by the UIM-SH3 construct
of the ESCRT-0 member STAM. To characterize
the underlying activation mechanism structurally and to gain insights
into the mode of recruitment of AMSH to ESCRT-0, we aimed to crystallize
the ternary complex consisting of a catalytically inactive DUB domain
construct of AMSH (bearing the active-site Glu to Ala mutation), UIM-SH3,
and Lys63-linked diubiquitin. However, we were unable to crystallize
this ternary complex, or even the binary complex of AMSH with diubiquitin.
We then turned to Sst2, the S. pombe orthologue of
AMSH. Catalytic constructs of Sst2 (Figure ), including many of its mutants, showed better expression and appeared
to be suitable for crystallization (the construct alone and its mutants
readily yielded crystals from multiple conditions). To generate the
corresponding ternary complex with the S. pombe constructs,
we prepared a similar inactivating mutant of the enzyme by replacing
the active-site Glu with Ala and prepared a complex with Lys63-linked
diubiquitin. Crystallization trials of this binary complex yielded
crystals, but surprisingly, these crystals happened to be those of
Sst2 bound to ubiquitin, a product fragment of diubiquitin. Thus,
in contrast to our expectation that the active-site Glu to Ala mutant
would be inactive, as has been seen in other thermolysin-like proteases,, there was enough hydrolytic activity under the crystallization conditions
to cleave diubiquitin, leading to cocrystallization with the product
(see below). To completely inactivate the enzyme so that it could
form a stable complex with the diubiquitin substrate and the UIM-SH3
construct, we had to introduce an additional mutation by changing
an active-site zinc-coordinating Asp to Ala. Furthermore, Sst2, while
sharing a high level of sequence similarity with AMSH in both its
catalytic and MIT (microtubule interacting and trafficking) domain
(for binding to ESCRT-III members), bears three substitutions in its
corresponding SBM that are presumed to render the SBM nonfunctional
for binding to the SH3 domain of STAM (Hse1 in S. pombe). We therefore engineered three mutations in this domain (Figure ) to restore a functional SBM as found in the human
counterpart (see below), with the hope of creating a construct of
Sst2 that would bind to the UIM-SH3 domain of Hse1. Indeed, a ternary
complex consisting of the catalytically inactive Sst2 DUB construct,
Lys63-linked diubiquitin, and the UIM-SH3 domain could be purified
via size exclusion chromatography, indicating that a stable complex
was formed among the three proteins (Figure 1 of the ). Despite several attempts to conduct
crystallization trials, the complex so far has yielded crystals of
only the enzyme bound to Lys63-linked diubiquitin. The crystal structures
of these two complexes allow comparison of Sst2 bound to the product,
generated, as described previously, in situ from
a mixture of enzyme (catalytically impaired because of the Glu to
Ala mutation, yet with some residual activity) and its substrate.
Additionally, we decided to take advantage of Sst2’s crystallizability
to understand the basis of the MIC-CAP mutation at the atomic level by generating the Thr319Ile mutant
in the DUB domain of Sst2.

Comparison of AMSH, AMSH-LP, and Sst2. (a) Domain
structures of
AMSH, AMSH-LP, and Sst2. The JAMM domain is colored blue, while the
SBM and MIT domains are colored purple and green, respectively. Sst2cat and Sst2Δ220 were used to crystallize
product- and substrate-bound structures, respectively. Sst2Δ220 contains mutations that both inactivated the enzyme (for substrate
binding) and knocked in a functional SBM for recognition of the SH3
domain of STAM. (b) Comparison of the SBM of AMSH, AMSH-LP, and Sst2.
Mutations made in the SBM of Sst2 to make it functional for SH3 binding
are colored red. (c) The isopeptide bond of diubiquitin is formed
between proximal ubiquitin (UbP), which donates its lysine, and distal
ubiquitin (UbD), which donates its C-terminal carboxylate group. In
other protease systems, UbD and UbP are equivalent to the P and P′
fragments, respectively, of a peptide bond.

Structure of the Catalytic Domain of Sst2 in Its Free Form
Structure
Determination
To gain structural insights
into Sst2, we have crystallized a construct spanning the catalytic
domain of the protein, here termed Sst2cat (residues 245–435).
Sst2cat crystallized in two different space groups, P21 and P212121. The P21 form has
two subunits in the asymmetric unit, whereas the P212121 form has three subunits.
The structure of Sst2cat was determined by zinc single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion (SAD) and also by molecular replacement (MR)
using the structure of the catalytic domain of AMSH-LP as the search
model (see Table  for crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics).
The structures were refined yielding satisfactory crystallographic
and free R factors with good stereochemistry.

Like the DUB domain of AMSH-LP and AMSH,, its two most closely related homologues, the structure of Sst2cat features a JAMM core with two characteristic insertions,
insertion 1 (Ins-1, residues 308–333) and insertion 2 (Ins-2,
residues 388–413). These insertions play an important role
in ubiquitin recognition and contribute key functional groups for
catalysis performed by these enzymes. The JAMM core consists of a
mixed β-sheet, which adopts the shape of a partially open β-barrel
sandwiched by two α-helices, one on top (α1) and one on
the bottom (α3) (Figure a), an architectural
feature shared among the members of JAMM domain proteins, such as AfJAMM and Prp8.,− As seen in AMSH-LP and AMSH, the catalytic site is lined mostly
by residues from the JAMM core, from the loop between α1 and
β2, α3, β6, and the loop following it (Figure a). The catalytic zinc is held in tetrahedral geometry
by residues from the JAMM core, coordinated by His341, His343 (located
on β6 and immediately following it), Asp354 (located on α3),
and a water molecule that is hydrogen bonded to Glu286 (located on
the loop segment following α1) (Figure b). This zinc site is complemented by the conserved serine residue
on α3 (Ser351), which serves as the oxyanion-stabilizing side
chain. The second, structural zinc is located approximately 14 Å
from the active-site zinc and is coordinated by the residue His356
from the JAMM core and residues His404, His406, and Cys397 from Ins-2
(Figure c), the same set of equivalent residues
that coordinate the second zinc ion in AMSH-LP and AMSH.

and Ins-2 of Sst2 are colored aquamarine, yellow, and green, respectively.
The insets show the active-site zinc and the structural zinc. (b)

site, located 14 Å from the catalytic center. (d) Cis peptide
conformation of Pro388 in Sst2 (aquamarine) forming a hydrogen bond
with backbone NH groups of Gly256. AMSH is colored pink for reference.

The structure of Sst2 can be superimposed
with those of AMSH and
AMSH-LP with Cα root-mean-square deviations (rmsds) of 0.71
and 0.59 Å, respectively, indicating substantial structural conservation
between these JAMM DUBs. A noteworthy difference, however, is the
presence of a cis peptide unit in Sst2, Asp387-Pro388. The cis conformation
permits the carbonyl group of Pro388 to engage in a hydrogen bond
with the backbone NH group of Gly256, from the turn segment of the
N-terminal β-hairpin of Sst2cat (Figure d). The significance of the cis peptide unit is
unclear at the moment. Perhaps such hydrogen bonding could provide
extra stability to the helix starting from Pro388, a helix that contributes
a critical cysteine (Cys397) for holding the structural zinc in position.

Structure of the Complex with Lys63-Linked Diubiquitin
Crystallization
of Sst2 and Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub2) was accomplished
by using an Sst2 construct, termed Sst2Δ220, which
spans residues 221–435 and was designed
to contain the SBM motif from AMSH by incorporation of three point
mutations: Tyr234Val, Thr235Asp, and Glu239Lys. To prevent the cleavage
of diubiquitin, we also introduced two mutations into the active site;
Glu286, which binds to the nucleophilic water, and Asp354, which coordinates
the catalytic zinc, were both mutated to alanine, resulting in an
inactive form of Sst2 [unlike the Glu286Ala mutant alone, which exhibited
residual activity (see below)]. As described before, crystals containing
the complex of Sst2Δ220 and K63-Ub2 formed
from a mixture purified via gel filtration chromatography comprising
Sst2Δ220, the UIM-SH3 domain from HseI, and K63-Ub2. It is likely that K63-Ub2 forms a tight complex
with Sst2, as indicated by ITC measurements with a catalytically inactive
mutant, revealing a KD of 1.1 ± 0.1
μM (Table ), whereas the UIM-SH3 construct
may have somewhat weaker affinity for the binary complex, which could
explain why we are unable to crystallize the ternary complex. The
structure was determined by molecular replacement using a model of
Sst2–K63-Ub2 generated by superimposition of Sst2cat with the structure of AMSH-LP bound to K63-Ub2 (PDB entry 2ZNV()) and refined yielding satisfactory
crystallographic, free R factors and good stereochemistry
(Table ). The 27 N-terminal residues (221–247)
of Sst2Δ220 were not resolved in the crystal structure.
Moreover, because of a lack of side-chain density, the final model
has alanine substitutions of the following residues in Sst2: Phe248,
Lys249, Glu297, Asn331, and Val434. Furthermore, poor density in chain
C (proximal ubiquitin), presumably resulting from positional disorder
(Figure 2 of the ), forced us to delete residues 7–11, 28–42, 47, and
70–76 from chain C.

The overall three-dimensional
fold of Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2 is highly
similar to the structure of
the DUB domain of AMSH-LP bound to K63-Ub2 (PDB entry 2ZNV) with an rmsd of
1.19 Å of Cα atoms over 266 residues from both Sst2 and
K63-Ub2. K63-Ub2 binds to Sst2Δ220 in an extended conformation around the isopeptide linker (Figure a), with the majority of the protein contacts contributed
by the distal ubiquitin (Figure c), consistent
with the mode of diubiquitin binding observed in AMSH-LP. Comparison
of the buried surface areas for distal and proximal ubiquitin using
PISA, 1120 and 426 Å2, respectively, further augments this observation. Sst2Δ220 features a catalytic channel spanning approximately 20 Å, occupied
largely by the C-terminal tail of the distal ubiquitin, allowing proper
orientation of the isopeptide bond in the active site. The active
site of Sst2 normally coordinates zinc, but our structure is in the
apo (unmetalated) state, because of two mutations in residues contributing
to zinc coordination: mutation of Asp354 to alanine has a direct impact
on metal affinity, because it is a member of the catalytic triad that
coordinates to zinc. Metal affinity is further diminished by an additional
mutation, to Glu286, which indirectly coordinates zinc by binding
the nucleophilic water. In place of zinc, the active site of Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2 contains a water molecule.
This structure also reveals an alternative rotameric conformation
of Cys288 in Sst2, resulting in the formation of a partially occupied
disulfide bond with Cys317 (see below).

Sst2 is colored orange and distal ubiquitin bound to AMSH-LP yellow.

Proximal Ubiquitin Recognition
Proximal
ubiquitin binding
is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of AMSH-LP bound
to K63-Ub2. Figure d shows the
superposition of Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2 and AMSH-LP bound to K63-Ub2 (PDB entry 2ZNV()). The primary areas of Sst2 contributing to the recognition
of proximal ubiquitin stem from the Zn2+ coordination loop
of Ins-2 and a loop that links helix α3 to strand β6 in
the JAMM core. The residues engaged in proximal ubiquitin recognition
via van der Waals interactions or hydrogen bonding, are completely
conserved between AMSH-LP and AMSH. Phe403 makes three van der Waals
contacts with the isopeptide segment of diubiquitin: the Cζ
and Cε2 atoms of Phe403 form van der Waals contacts
with the Cδ atom of Lys63 from the proximal ubiquitin (4.1 and
3.9 Å, respectively), and the Cε2 atom of Phe403
makes an additional contact with the carbon atom of Gly76 from the
distal ubiquitin. Additional hydrophobic contacts with proximal ubiquitin
are likewise formed from the Cβ atom of Phe403 and the Cζ
atom of Phe349 with the Cγ atom of Gln62 and the Cγ atom
of Lys63 from proximal ubiquitin, while Pro405 forms a stacking interaction
with Phe4 of the proximal ubiquitin (Figure b). Consistent with the AMSH-LP–K63-Ub2 crystal
structure, hydrogen bonding interactions from two residues in Sst2,
Thr347 and Ser352, also make an important contribution to the recognition
of proximal ubiquitin. The Oγ atom and NH from the main chain
of Thr347 make hydrogen bonds with the Oε and Nε atoms
of Gln62, while both the Oγ atom and main-chain NH of Ser352
form hydrogen bonds with Oγ2 of Glu64 (Figure b).

Earlier mutational studies in both AMSH
and AMSH-LP on residues that engage in binding of the proximal ubiquitin
found a significant reduction in kcat with
a minimal change in KM as compared to
those of the wild-type enzyme, therefore indicating a role for the
proximal ubiquitin in the rate-limiting step of catalysis with little
involvement in the ground-state interaction with the substrate., It is likely that through their interactions with the proximal ubiquitin,
these residues play a critical role in properly orienting the isopeptide
for Lys63 linkage specific deubiquitination.

Crystallization
of Sst2 in Its Product-Bound State
Residual Activity in the
Glu286Ala Mutant
To improve
our understanding of interactions with Lys63-linked polyubiquitin
substrates, we first attempted to cocrystallize the Glu286Ala mutant
of Sst2cat with Lys63-linked diubiquitin. The mutation
was presumed to render the enzyme inactive on two accounts. (1) Glu286
plays a role in holding the catalytic water in its position allowing
it to serve as the fourth ligand for the active-site zinc. Its mutation
to Ala is likely to lead to a loss of zinc from the active site., With the loss of zinc, there is no water to act as a nucleophile.
(2) The glutamate is also presumed to function as both a general base
and acid in the hydrolysis reaction, assuming that Sst2 hydrolyzes
its substrates following a thermolysin-like mechanism. Quite unexpectedly,
the crystals obtained from a solution containing both Sst2catE286A and Lys63-linked diubiquitin (prepared semisynthetically) proved instead to be those of Sst2catE286A bound to one ubiquitin moiety occupying the distal site. Thus,
this structure yielded a view of the enzyme’s product-bound
state, in which the product was actually generated from reaction during
crystallization trials. Because this product-bound structure contained
the E286A mutation in the enzyme, we also cocrystallized Sst2cat with ubiquitin (herein termed the Sst2cat–Ub
complex) to visualize product contacts with the wild-type enzyme (resulting
in two additional structures of the enzyme bound to its product).
Because the structures share many similarities, we will use the Sst2catE286A structure to describe the interactions of Sst2 with
ubiquitin.

Sst2cat–Ub crystallized in two
different space groups, P21 and P212121, with two subunits
in the asymmetric unit of both crystal forms (Figure 3 of the ). The structure of the P21 form of wild-type Sst2cat–Ub
was determined by Zn SAD, and the refined model was used as the search
model for determining the structure of both the wild-type protein
and the E286A mutant ubiquitin complexes in the P212121 form (see Tables  and  for crystallographic
data collection and refinement statistics). Interestingly, the subunits
in the asymmetric unit of wild-type Sst2cat–Ub in
the orthorhombic crystal form show zinc-mediated packing at the interface
(Figure 4 of the ). Two zinc ions are found at the interface, related by a 2-fold
noncrystallographic symmetry. The tetrahedral coordination around
these zinc ions is furnished by two His residues from one subunit,
a Glu from the symmetry-related partner, and a chloride ion (Figure
4b of the ). These
zinc-coordinating interactions appear to provide substantial stabilization
leading to the packing of the monomers in the crystallographic dimer
as observed here. Additional hydrogen bonding interactions (two copies
of Ser324-Gln428, each pair contributing two hydrogen bonds) and van
der Waals packing of aromatic side chains (Phe328) also contribute
to dimer formation. The zinc and chloride ions found at the dimer
interface might have been from the reservoir solution, which contained
ZnCl2.

Structures of Sst2cat–Ub (1.6 Å) and Sst2catE286A–Ub (1.7
Å) provide insights into the product-bound
state of the enzyme. Like the distal moiety of the substrate in the
diubiquitin-bound structure, ubiquitin as the product is held tightly
by a number of intermolecular interactions that include hydrogen bonding,
van der Waals contacts, and salt bridges, with most of the interactions
contributed by contacts holding its extreme C-terminal hexapeptide
LRLRGG motif in the active-site cleft (Figure ). This hexapeptide segment, as observed in the substrate-bound state,
aligns itself at the active-site cleft as an extended β-strand,
in register with strand β5 of Ins-1, and is engaged in backbone
and side-chain interactions with strand β5 on one side and helix
α3 from the JAMM core on the other. Interestingly, the JAMM
core residues involved in ubiquitin binding on helix α3 are
conserved in AMSH, AMSH-LP, and Sst2, while residues from strand β5
of Ins-1 that contribute to distal ubiquitin recognition are not entirely
conserved in all three proteins (Figure 5 of the ), suggesting that the JAMM core residues
are structurally important while the insertion residues, which evolved
later, are more interchangeable.

are outlined by electron density from a 2Fo – Fc map contoured at 1.2σ.

Generally, ubiquitin-interacting
proteins recognize a hydrophobic
patch surrounding Ile44 of ubiquitin (the I44 patch).− Like other cysteine protease DUBs and AMSH-LP, Sst2 also recognizes
the I44 patch in the distal ubiquitin. The structures of both ubiquitin
and diubiquitin complexes of Sst2 show contacts with residues in this
patch, which consists of Leu8, Ile44, Val70, and the Cβ atom
of His68 of ubiquitin (Figure a). In the case
of AMSH-LP, the aliphatic side chains of Val328 and Phe332 in Ins-1
interact with the residues of the hydrophobic patch. However, in both
Sst2 and AMSH, Val328 is substituted with Glu322 and Glu316, respectively.
The model of AMSH244 bound to Lys63-linked diubiquitin predicts that
Glu316 of AMSH might form electrostatic and polar interactions with
Arg42 and Gln49; however, in Sst2, the
equivalent residue, Glu322, forms an electrostatic interaction with
only Arg42 of ubiquitin. Our structures of ubiquitin- and diubiquitin-bound
complexes of Sst2 reveal that Phe326 in Ins-1 makes a number of van
der Waals contacts with the residues of the I44 patch, while Gln329
in Ins-1 makes van der Waals contacts with the side chain of Leu8
(Figure a). These complex structures also
reveal the interactions of Met364 from the JAMM core of Sst2 with
Ile36, Leu69, Leu71, and the Cγ atom of Thr7 in the distal ubiquitin,
which forms the hydrophobic pocket opposite the I44 patch (Figure c). Thus, as the foregoing discussion has indicated,
many of the interactions seen with the distal ubiquitin in the structure
of Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2 are preserved
in the product-bound structure.

Superposition of the DUB domain
of AMSH, the AMSH-LP–K63-Ub2 complex, and the Sst2catE286A–Ub complex
reveals that most of the residues involved in distal ubiquitin recognition
are conserved (Figure a). However, the two
substitutions of Thr313 and Glu316 in AMSH and Thr319 and Glu322 in
Sst2 in place of Met325 and Val328 in AMSH-LP imply that the catalytic
domain of Sst2 shares more similarities with AMSH than AMSH-LP as
far as ubiquitin binding is concerned. Comparison to the structures
of AMSH and AMSH-LP shows three substitutions in the distal binding
site (Figure b). Interestingly, despite these
substitutions, the number of interactions with ubiquitin is not significantly
altered. For example, substitution of Gly at position 318 of Sst2
in place of Asn in AMSH and Asp in AMSH-LP leads to a loss of hydrogen
bonding and salt bridge interaction with Arg74 of ubiquitin, but hydrogen
bonding of Arg74 with Thr319 of Sst2 reestablishes this interaction.
Overall, these structures show that the distal site is evolutionarily
less constrained than the proximal site.

Product Specific Interactions
In the diubiquitin-bound
structure, the Cα atom of Gly76 forms a hydrophobic interaction
with the Cε2 atom of Phe403 and is located adjacent
to the metal center, showing how the scissile peptide bond in the
substrate would be placed adjacent to the nucleophilic water (Figure b). Contrary to our expectation, the hydrolysis
of diubiquitin by the E286A mutant means that the active-site water
and the metal are still intact in this mutant. Interestingly, the
structure of Sst2catE286A–Ub does reveal zinc in
the active site and water coordinating the zinc ion. Some interesting
differences can be seen between the E286A product-bound structure
and that represented by wild-type Sst2cat–Ub. In
the latter, the carboxylate group of Gly76 of ubiquitin coordinates
the catalytic zinc to maintain its tetrahedral coordination while
also forming a hydrogen bond with Glu286 (Figure a). In contrast, the former shows the same carboxylate group
displaced from Zn2+ by a water that has taken its place
in the metal coordination sphere (Figure b).
This is remarkable because it appears as if we have managed to crystallize
a form of the product complex representing a transient solution species
in which the product is about to depart and the catalytic water is
about to reestablish its contact with the active-site metal.

of Gly76 from distal ubiquitin (P-product fragment) replaces the catalytic

the carboxylate group of Gly76. (c) In Sst2catD354A, water
is occupying the zinc site. In all panels, electron density from a
2Fo – Fc map is shown as blue mesh (at 1.0σ).

Although subtle, changes in a loop (flap) located at the
top of
the active site (near the proximal ubiquitin binding site) could also
be observed. The prime residues of interest in this loop are Leu402
and Phe403 (Figure a), coming from the Ins-2
segment that also is responsible for coordination of the structural
zinc. The loop appears to have moved away from van der Waals contact
with Thr316, creating an opening, likely to accommodate the displaced
carboxylate in Sst2catE286A–Ub. This is significant
because in all of our other structures (free form, substrate-bound
form, and product-bound form in which the C-terminal ubiquitin carboxylate
coordinates with zinc), Phe403 and Leu402 make van der Waals contacts
with Thr316 and Asp315, resulting in a closed conformation (Figure b,c,e). Comparison of the van der Waals contacts
made in all four structures is summarized in Table .

In Sst2cat–Ub, Phe403 and Thr316 reaching
out
to one another across the cleft are located 4.0 Å apart, a distance
that is close to that of a van der Waals contact between the two.
Also contributing to the closed conformation are Leu402 and Thr316,
which are 4.4 Å apart, while Phe403 approaches the Cα atom
of Gly76 of ubiquitin from the top, making a close van der Waals contact
with this residue. In the free form of Sst2cat, the closed
conformation at the active-site cleft is maintained in the absence
of substrate, as well; however, the mobility of the loop results in
Phe403 establishing a contact with Asp315 (instead of Thr316) and
Leu402 makes a contact with Thr316. This slight change in interacting
partners has completely closed the active-site cleft from the proximal
end. Interestingly, the structure of Sst2Δ220 bound
to K63-Ub2 also reveals a closed position of the loop,
which makes van der Waals contact with the hydrocarbon portion of
the acceptor Lys residue in the proximal ubiquitin. However, this
residue, in fact, the two-residue turn segment, Leu402-Phe403, needs
to move apart relative to Thr316 to make room for the diubiquitin
substrate to position itself correctly in the active site. (These
observations are also true in the structure of AMSH-LP bound to diubiquitin.)
It seems likely that the β-turn segment is dynamic, fluctuating
between open and closed forms; the substrate binds to the open form,
perhaps by conformational selection. Superposition of all of our structures
for the catalytic domain of free Sst2, ubiquitin-bound Sst2 (Sst2cat–Ub and Sst2catE286A–Ub), and diubiquitin-bound
Sst2 reveals that Leu402 and Phe403 are mobile (Figure a). The different mobility of side chains of Asp315, Leu402,
and Phe403 shows that these three residues are involved in a conformational
change between the free form and ubiquitin-bound form.

It is
likely that the dynamics of the active-site flap may contribute
to the recognition of specific Ub lysine linkages in addition to its
role in catalysis. To probe whether the dynamics from this flap are
associated with linkage specificity, we mutated Phe395 in AMSH to
alanine (corresponding to the same residue as Phe403 in Sst2). The
mutant exhibits significantly impaired catalytic activity; however, like the wild-type enzyme, it was still
unable to cleave Lys48-linked diubiquitin [we used up to 2 μM
enzyme and 23 h reaction time, but failed to detect any product (Figure
7 of the )]. This
observation does not rule out the possibility that dynamics of the
flap could be a factor behind linkage specificity. More detailed studies
using point mutants of the other residues from the flap and Thr316
and Asp315 are required to probe the contribution of the flap to linkage
specificity. Of note, Sst2, unlike AMSH, appears to cleave Lys48-linked
diubiquitin, albeit with an efficiency significantly lower than that
of the Lys63-linked chain. Under conditions in which formation of
the product from K63-linked diubiquitin is essentially complete in
1 h, the enzyme takes nearly 24 h to produce an appreciable amount
of product from Lys48-linked diubiquitin (see Figure 8 of the ). The plant orthologue
AMSH3 appears to be adept at cleaving both Lys63- and Lys48-linked
chains. It will be interesting to know
the basis of relaxed specificity in going from AMSH to AMSH3 and if
the dynamic nature of the flap is an underlying factor.

Structural
Effect of the MIC-CAP Disease-Causing Thr to Ile
Mutation
Recently, a whole-exome sequencing analysis led
to the discovery of recessive mutations in the gene encoding AMSH
that cause microcephaly capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome. MIC-CAP syndrome, diagnosed at or shortly after
birth, is characterized by severe microcephaly (a condition in which
an infant’s head is significantly smaller than the heads of
other children of the same age and sex) with progressive cortical
atrophy, intractable epilepsy, profound developmental delay, and excessive
small capillary malformations on the skin.,− The phenotype is attributed to the accumulation of
ubiquitinated proteins, suggesting a loss of enzymatic function of
AMSH, consistent with similar accumulation of polyubiquitinated species
seen in knockout mice studies., The study that discovered
that mutations in AMSH could lead to MIC-CAP syndrome reported six
missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, two translational frameshift
mutations, and three intronic mutations. Five of the six missense mutations occur within the MIT domain of
AMSH, and the sixth, Thr313Ile, occurs within the JAMM domain. Because
the crystal structure of AMSH bound to ubiquitin is not known, we
took advantage of our structure to gain insights into possible effects
the mutation may have on the structure of AMSH and its ubiquitin recognition.

In Sst2, the corresponding residue is
Thr319, which makes a hydrogen-bonding contact using its side-chain
OH group with the backbone NH group of Leu73 of ubiquitin as seen
in the structure of Sst2cat–Ub (and other ubiquitin-bound
structures reported here, as well). In the structure of Sst2cat, this side chain is solvent-exposed. Mutation to Ile is unlikely
to cause any serious perturbation to its overall three-dimensional
structure. It thus appears that the mutation may weaken interactions
with ubiquitin required for substrate recognition and/or catalysis.
It is also possible that mutation to Ile may introduce additional
steric clash with ubiquitin. To examine this, we generated an in silico model of the mutant based on the ubiquitin-bound
structure of the wild-type enzyme and subjected it to refinement for
generating a model with optimized contacts. The final model shows
that isoleucine could be accommodated in place of threonine without
causing any serious steric clash with ubiquitin. Indeed, the X-ray
structure of the Thr319Ile mutant of Sst2cat in its free
form reveals minimal changes in the protein structure adjacent to
the Ile319, with the global structure of the mutant remaining largely
unchanged relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. The most noticeable
change in the Ile mutant was localized around the site of mutation:
the side chain of Glu322, adjacent to Ile319, is oriented perpendicular
to its original conformation in the free and ubiquitin-bound forms
of Sst2cat (Figure a). This is
interesting because when ubiquitin is bound to Sst2cat,
Thr319 makes a hydrogen-bonding contact with Glu322 (distance of 2.6
Å between Oγ of Thr and Oδ of Glu), which is the
only contact the latter residue makes with a protein atom. This contact
appears to hold Glu322 in a position so that it could engage in hydrogen-bonding
and electrostatic contacts with Arg42 of ubiquitin as seen in the
crystal structure of Sst2cat–Ub (Figure b). Thus, it is possible that substitution with
Ile may lead to a loss of this interaction as well, explaining the
substantial effect on the enzyme’s catalytic activity (Table ).

Thr319 observed in the Sst2cat–Ub complex. Residues
of Sst2 and Ub involved in interaction are colored aquamarine and

On the basis of the structural
analysis presented above, we expected
that loss of contacts with Leu73 and perhaps also with Arg42 of ubiquitin
with the T319 mutant may destabilize the Michaelis complex relative
to the wild-type enzyme. However, our kinetic analysis shows a substantial
effect on kcat with little change in KM, consistent with results from a similar study
with the Thr313Ile mutant of AMSH. It
appears that interactions involving the Thr residue are particularly
important in aligning the scissile peptide bond in the proximity of
the catalytic groups during formation of the transition state in the
enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

A Reactive Cysteine Adjacent to the Active
Site
A pair
of cysteines (Cys288 and Cys317), with one of them adjacent to the
catalytic site and solvent-exposed (Cys317), appears to be conserved
within AMSH-like DUBs, as seen by comparison of the sequences of AMSH,
AMSH-LP, and Sst2 (Figure 5 of the ). The distance between the two thiol groups is
4.4 Å. Cys317 contributes to two interbackbone hydrogen bonds
with Gly75 of ubiquitin. Interestingly, in two of our structures (Sst2Δ220–K63-Ub2 and the free form of Sst2cat from the P21 space group),
the Fo – Fc map shows residual positive density that could be easily
interpreted as an alternative rotameric conformation of Cys288, a
conformation that brings the two cysteines within disulfide-forming
distance, allowing us to model a disulfide bridge between the two
cysteines (Figure f). It is possible that
under oxidative conditions this pair will exist as a fully occupied
disulfide bridge (DTT in our purification buffer may be responsible
for reduction of the disulfide, giving us only a partial population
of the oxidized form and none in other structures). A similar observation
was also made in the case of AMSH, while a fully occupied disulfide
bond was observed in AfJAMM, the first ever JAMM domain protein to
be structurally characterized., The reason behind the
presence of the cysteine pair with the potential to form this disulfide
bond is not clear at the moment. One possibility may be the endosome-bound
form requires the disulfide bond. Association with ESCRT-III through
the MIT domain is required for deubiquitination of the cargo before
formation of intraluminal vesicles in MVBs, an interaction that is
especially tight (KD ∼ 60 nM). It has been proposed that the VPS4 complex will
catalyze the dissociation of AMSH from the ESCRT-III members at the
end of MVB biogenesis so that the DUB and the ESCRT members can be
reused for another around of endocytic sorting., It is tempting to speculate that the disulfide bridge may render
AMSH stable enough so that it can be dissociated from the ESCRT-III
complex after the action of VPS4 but still remain folded.

Discussion
As mentioned earlier, AMSH is thought to share
distinct mechanistic
similarities with the well-studied metalloprotease thermolysin. On the basis of this assumed similarity with
thermolysin, the mechanism of diubiquitin cleavage by AMSH and closely
related enzymes (such as Sst2) is illustrated in Figure . Abstraction of a proton by the active-site glutamate (Glu286
in Sst2), the presumed general base, activates the zinc-bound water,
converting it into a potent nucleophile. This nucleophilic water then
attacks the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond, leading to
a tetrahedral intermediate, which is stabilized by the interaction
of the oxyanion with a nearby serine serving as the oxyanion-stabilizing
residue [Ser351 in Sst2 (Figure e)]. The leaving
group, the proximal ubiquitin, then departs, being aided by the transfer
of a proton to the amine group by the same glutamic acid, now working
as a proton donor. The departure of the leaving group is accompanied
by the collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate forming the carboxylate
group of the P (unprimed) fragment. At this stage, the carboxylate
group of the P-product fragment, which corresponds to the distal ubiquitin
in the diubiquitin substrate, is coordinated to the catalytic zinc
(Figure ). Finally, the P fragment dissociates,
making room for the catalytic water to reestablish its coordinating
position adjacent to the active-site zinc. The mechanism dictates
that Glu286 be an essential residue for catalysis. In contrast, we
observed that the Glu286Ala mutant of Sst2 still has some residual
activity, much like the case of matrilysin,, suggesting that Glu286 in Sst2 may not be playing the role of the
general base in the hydrolysis reaction. Instead, it may be required
for stabilization of the transition state through hydrogen bonding
with the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond and for donation
of a proton to the leaving group. This is consistent with the observation
that Glu286 is seen as the donor in the hydrogen bonding interaction
with the carboxylate of Gly76 of ubiquitin (Figure  and Figure 6 of the ) in our crystal structures. Because these crystals were grown from
solutions with pH values ranging from 7 to 8, our data indicate that
Glu286 may have a relatively high pKa,
at least 7, and would therefore remain protonated during catalysis.
To be an effective general base, the glutamate must ionize readily
below pH 7, as seen in the case of thermolysin., Although the exact nature of the active-site Glu in Sst2 and related
enzymes remains to be characterized, our structural studies point
to the possibility that, in Sst2, the zinc-bound water may be ionized
significantly to serve as the nucleophile directly, as was proposed
for matrilysin., Future studies aimed at delineating
the pH dependence of activity should reveal more insight into the
mechanism of Sst2 and related enzymes. Moreover, mutation of Glu to
Ala in thermolysin-like enzymes leads to loss of Zn, unlike the case
for Sst2 and matrilysin. On the basis of these observations, we propose
that Sst2 may behave more like matrilysin rather than like thermolysin.
It remains to be seen whether AMSH and other related enzymes behave
like Sst2.

Proposed mechanism of hydrolysis by Sst2 and related enzymes, based
on a thermolysin-like mechanism. UbP (green) denotes proximal ubiquitin,
while UbD (orange) indicates distal ubiquitin. Steps of the mechanism
that we have captured crystallographically are shown in boxes i.,
ii., v., and vi. In boxes ii. and vi., atoms that were modeled in
because they were absent due to mutation are colored pink.

In the context of diubiquitin hydrolysis, the fate
of the P-product
fragment after hydrolysis may become relevant as this fragment is
engaged in a number of interactions with the enzyme. This is especially
important because the binding to the substrate occurs predominantly
through interactions of the distal ubiquitin (which corresponds to
the P fragment of the substrate). The proximal ubiquitin does not
seem to contribute significantly to substrate binding, although its
interactions are important during the transition state of the reaction,
as revealed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments with AMSH, which
showed that mutation of residues that bind to the proximal ubiquitin
affects kcat but not KM. Consistent with this observation,
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies reveal that like that
of AMSH, Sst2’s affinity for ubiquitin is similar to the KM for diubiquitin hydrolysis (Figures  and ).

wild-type Sst2. The inset shows a gel from kinetic reactions, showing
ubiquitin standards and different concentrations of the substrate
(K63-Ub2) sampled. Each reaction mixture contained 25 nM
Sst2cat, and each reaction proceeded for 7.5 min at 20
°C before being quenched with 5× SDS–PAGE sample
buffer. Bands corresponding to monoubiquitin were integrated using
ImageJ.

Our structures provide insight
into the nature of the interaction
with the P-product fragment. All of the interactions with the distal
ubiquitin of the substrate are still intact in the product-bound form.
The major difference between the substrate-bound state and the product-bound
state is with respect to interactions of the Gln62-Lys63-Glu64 tripeptide
segment with Phe4 of the proximal ubiquitin, interactions that would
be relevant only to substrate binding but will be absent in the product.
These interactions are replaced by interactions associated with metal-coordinating
binding of the carboxylate group in the product-bound form. One of
the carboxylate oxygens of ubiquitin’s Gly76 occupies the void
left by the nucleophilic water. The other oxygen is engaged in a hydrogen
bonding interaction with Glu286 working as the hydrogen bond donor
(the distance between the oxygen atoms is 2.7 Å). These interactions
of the carboxylate on Gly76 of ubiquitin may contribute to the tight
binding of the product, although, surprisingly, mutation of Glu286
to Ala did not result in any loss of ubiquitin affinity. In fact,
the mutant actually appears to bind ubiquitin slightly stronger than
the wild-type enzyme (Table ). It is possible that the active-site structure in the mutant
has changed, which might account for the anomalous behavior we are
observing here. The role of Glu286 and ubiquitin’s Gly76 interaction
is therefore not clear at the moment. Nevertheless, our studies seem
to provide a rationale for the observation that, for both AMSH and
Sst2, the affinity for the product (KD for ubiquitin) matches the KM value
observed with the diubiquitin substrate (Table ). The structural data may provide a rationale for this observation
if we assume that the carboxylate group of the product binding to
zinc offsets the loss of interactions contributed by the proximal
ubiquitin. This may imply that the free cytosolic form of AMSH may
remain inhibited by binding to ubiquitin, as the concentration of
free ubiquitin in cells is close to the KD values we have measured.

Proteases in general are tightly regulated, revealing their full
catalytic potential only when desired. Several means of regulation
of protease activity have been well characterized, examples of which
include sequestration of proteases through compartmentalization, such
as caspases,− proteasome,− and lysosomal proteases,− and conversion
of precursor enzymes to active forms through zymogen activation, such as digestive enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin,
and reversible posttranslational modification. However, the mechanism
underlying regulation of the catalytic activity of DUBs is relatively
poorly understood. Recent reports show
that some cysteine DUBs can be regulated by reversible oxidation of
their catalytic cysteine., More generally, however,
a substantial number of DUBs appear to be regulated via association
with other proteins, including ubiquitin, serving as both a part of
their substrates and their product.− Accordingly, a number of DUBs
feature additional domains appended to or inserted into their catalytic
domain for associating with other proteins (activators), which in
turn induce productive forms of the associated DUB., Activation upon binding to other macromolecules can be allowed by
realignment of active-site residues, if they were misaligned in the
unbound state, or removal of steric occlusion by a conformational
transition induced upon activator binding., This is especially important for DUBs that exist in two distinct
pools, in the free form when not bound to anything and in their active
form as a population of protein-bound enzymes.

It appears from
our studies that, for AMSH and related enzymes
like Sst2, the close correspondence between the affinity for ubiquitin
and the KM value for the substrate may
serve to regulate their catalytic activity. They could be inhibited
when present in the free enzyme pool but manifest their full catalytic
prowess upon assembly with other proteins, such as ESCRT-0 in the
case of AMSH. Because the intracellular concentration of free ubiquitin
is expected to be higher than that of the K63-linked polyubiquitin
chain and is close to the dissociation constant for free ubiquitin
(our studies), one would expect the free
enzyme would be inhibited. Assembly with other protein complexes may
serve to activate these enzymes by providing additional factors that
tip the balance toward better recognition of the substrate over free
ubiquitin, such as the ubiquitin-binding UIM domain present in STAM,
in whose case the UIM domain appears to provide additional strength
to substrate binding by engaging with the proximal ubiquitin.
