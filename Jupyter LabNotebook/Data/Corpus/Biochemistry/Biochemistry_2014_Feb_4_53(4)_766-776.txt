Ribonucleotide
reductases (RNRs,
Figure ) catalyze the conversion of nucleoside
5′-diphosphates (NDPs) to deoxynucleotides (dNDPs) and play
an essential role in supplying balanced dNTP pools for DNA replication
and repair. The RNRs have been classified
based on the metallo-cofactors used to generate a transient cysteine
thiyl radial that is essential for catalysis. The class I RNRs contain two subunits (α and β) with
subclassification (Ia, Ib, and Ic, Figure ) based on the dimetallo-cofactor located in β. Class Ib RNRs,
as with class Ia enzymes, were long thought to use a diferric-tyrosyl
radical (FeIII2-Y·) cofactor because the
cluster can self-assemble and has catalytic activity.− Recently however, the class Ib RNRs have been isolated and characterized
from their endogenous sources (Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis) in sufficient amounts to establish that the cofactor is a dimanganic-tyrosyl
radical (MnIII2-Y·).− While most prokaryotes have multiple
RNRs, B. subtilis has a single essential class Ib
RNR found in the nrdI-nrdE-nrdF-ymaB operon.− The apparent
tight binding of the subunits of the B. subtilis RNR and the low reported specific activities of this
and other class Ib enzymes (, SI-Table 1), provided the impetus to maximize its catalytic activity
for future structural determination.

Ribonucleotide reduction catalyzed by
class I RNRs. (A) The class
Ib RNRs are composed of NrdE (α) and NrdF (β) which are
proposed to form an α2β2 complex
during substrate turnover (only one α/β pair depicted).
The stable dimaganic-Y· housed in β (1 Y·/β2) oxidizes an essential Cys residue in the active site of
α to a thiyl radical through a long-range radical transfer process
involving redox-active amino acids in both subunits. Reduction of
NDPs to dNDPs occurs concomitant with oxidation of two Cys residues
to a disulfide. The disulfide is rereduced by a thioredoxin (TR) or
NrdH (a glutaredoxin-like thioredoxin), thioredoxin reductase (TRR),
and NADPH. (B) The dimetallo-cofactors of the class Ia and Ic β
subunits.

In all class I RNRs, α (designated
NrdE for class Ib and
NrdA for class Ia, Figure ) contains the active
site for NDP reduction and binding sites for allosteric effectors
that control substrate specificity. The
class Ia α contains a second allosteric site in its N-terminal
ATP cone domain that controls the overall rate of nucleotide reduction
and is absent in the class Ib α subunits. The β subunit
(NrdF for class Ib and NrdB for class Ia) are all dimeric (β2) with the class Ia housing a FeIII2-Y· cofactor (typically with 3.6 Fe/β2 and
1 Y·/β2) and the class Ib housing a MnIII2-Y·, whose stoichiometry remains to be optimized
in all systems.

Recent data suggest
that in addition to allosteric effectors, quaternary
structure(s) of the class I RNRs, including subunit affinity and its
dependence on nucleotide binding, are all important in regulating
RNR activity. The subunit affinity in
the E. coli and human class Ia RNRs have reported Kd’s of ∼0.2 μM in the presence
of substrate (CDP)/effector (ATP).− While there is now a
consensus that the active quaternary structure of E. coli class Ia RNR is α2β2,− the eukaryotic Ia structure is open to debate [(α2)n(β2)m (n = 1, 3 and m = 1, 3)].− Recent studies have further revealed that the active complexes of
both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic RNRs are dynamic.,,, The quaternary structures of the class Ib RNRs, especially with
the MnIII2-Y· cofactor, have been much
less extensively studied and remain to be determined.,,

Since the establishment
that class Ib RNRs possess a MnIII2-Y·
cofactor, many efforts have been made to isolate
and characterize these enzymes.−,− With one exception, the reported activities
of purified class Ib RNRs, whether endogenously or recombinantly sourced,
are substantially lower (, SI-Table 1) than their class Ia counterparts
(5000–8000 nmol min–1 mg–1). Recently our lab isolated the class
Ib RNR from B. subtilis with NrdE and NrdF copurifying
in a 1:1 ratio through three chromatographic steps in the absence
of nucleotides and Mg2+, suggesting “tight”
subunit affinity. However, while the RNR
was 80% pure, its catalytic activity was low (∼160 nmol min–1 mg–1). Efforts to reconstitute
active RNR using recombinantly expressed NrdE and reconstituted MnIII2-Y· NrdF also resulted in low catalytic
activity.,

In this paper, we report optimization
of the catalytic activity
of the B. subtilis RNR by separation of active MeIII2-Y· loaded-NrdF (Me = Fe or Mn) from the
apo- and mismetalated forms and that the active form has 1 Y·/β2 and 4 Mn/β2. We also report the identification,
cloning, expression, and purification of candidate genes for the endogenous
reductants for B. subtilis RNR: TrxA and YosR, a
thioredoxin and a glutaredoxin-like thioredoxin, respectively, and
TrxB, a thioredoxin reductase. Activity assays with a 1:1 ratio of
MnIII2-Y· NrdF:NrdE using either TrxA or
YosR with TrxB gave specific activities of ∼1250 nmol min–1 mg–1, 7-fold higher activity than
the FeIII2-Y· cofactor, and substantially
higher than other class Ib RNRs (, SI-Table 1). A comparison of
the ability of DTT versus the endogenous reductants to support RNR
activity with purified or unpurified MnIII2-Y·
NrdF revealed that the use of the endogenous reductants contributed
significantly more to the activity enhancement relative to the cluster
loading of NrdF. Activity assays with CDP/ATP and increasing concentrations
of NrdE:NrdF maintained in a 1:1 ratio gave an apparent Km of 25 nM, 10-fold lower than the apparent Kd for the Ia RNRs with the same substrate/effector pair., The quaternary structure of each subunit and a 1:1 mixture of NrdE:NrdF
at physiological concentrations (1 μM) was examined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sedimentation
velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) in the absence of
nucleotides. These studies reveal that NrdE is a monomer, MeIII2-Y· NrdF is a dimer, and the 1:1 mixture of NrdE
and NrdF is a mixture of subunits and higher molecular weight species.
These studies set the stage for determination of nucleotide binding
and how it effects subunit interactions and quaternary structure in
a class Ib RNR.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Chemical
reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
at the highest purity available. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase,
and isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG) were purchased
from Promega (Madison, WI). All DNA sequencing of cloned genes was
carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers
Laboratory. Ni-NTA Fast Flow affinity resin was from Qiagen. Complete
EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets and calf alkaline phosphatase
(20 μmol min–1 μL–1) were purchased from Roche Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Amicon
Ultra-15 centrifugal filter devices were from Millipore. N-Terminally
His6-tagged NrdI and apo-NrdF were expressed and purified
as reported previously., Apo-NrdF was reconstituted with
MnIII2-Y· and FeIII2-Y· as previously described.,

Cloning, Expression,
and Purification of N-Terminally His6-tagged TrxA, TrxB,
and YosR
The genes trxA, yosR, and trxB were amplified
by PCR using B. subtilis JH624 genomic DNA (a gift
from A. Grossman in the Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute
of Technology) as a template and the primers listed in , SI-Table 2. The amplified
DNA fragments were digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET14b
(Novagen) using T4 DNA ligase to create the vectors pXZtrxA, pXZtrxB,
and pXZyosR.

TrxA and YosR were overproduced from pXZtrxA and
pXZyosR, respectively, transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS E.
coli cells (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 1 L of ampicillin-supplemented
(Amp, 100 μg/mL) LB broth in 6 L Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 °C
with 200 rpm shaking. At an OD600 of 0.8, IPTG was added
to a final concentration of 0.2 mM and cultures were incubated for
an additional 2 h before harvest. TrxB was overproduced from pXZtrxB
transformed into BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus RIL-X E. coli cells (Agilent Technologies) following the same procedure with the
exception that baffled 2.8 L Fernbach flasks were used for culture
growth and incubation postinduction was extended to 3 h before harvest.
Typical yields were 2.4–3.0 g cell paste L–1 for all strains.

The purification of all three proteins was
the same through the
nickel affinity step unless otherwise noted and was carried out at
4 °C. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended to 0.2
g paste mL–1 in buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate,
300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.6) supplemented
with protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by passage through a French
pressure cell at 14 000 psi and the debris was removed by centrifugation
(35000g, 20 min). Streptomycin sulfate solution was
added to the stirring cell extracts dropwise over 10 min to a final
concentration of 1% (w/v). After an additional 15 min of stirring,
precipitated materials were removed by centrifugation (35000g, 20 min). The streptomycin treatment was not used in the
purification of TrxB as it caused precipitation of the desired protein.
Clarified extracts were incubated with Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in
buffer A for 1 h (1 mL of resin per 2.5 g of cell paste) on a rocker.
The resin was then packed into a column and washed with 20 column
volumes (CVs) of buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 20
mM imidazole, 5% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.6) before eluting protein with
buffer C (50 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, 5%
(w/v) glycerol, pH 7.6). Protein-containing fractions were identified
using 15% SDS-PAGE gels and were then pooled and desalted on a Sephadex
G-25 column with buffer D (50 mM sodium phosphate, 5% (w/v) glycerol,
pH 7.6).

TrxA was purified further with a Sephadex G-75 column
(41 ×
2.5 cm, 0.25 mL min–1) equilibrated with SEC buffer
(50 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6). The fractions containing
TrxA, assessed by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and desalted with an Amicon
Ultra-15 YM-3 centrifugal filter (3000 MWCO). Typical yields were
11 ± 4 mg TrxA g–1 cell paste. Purity was assessed
by 15% SDS-PAGE (, SI-Figure 1), and protein concentrations were estimated by ε280 of 12 700 M–1 cm–1 (DNASTAR Lasergene 8). The specific activity (SA) of the purified
TrxA was ∼8–20 U/mg by the 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) assay.,

YosR and TrxB were further
purified by anion exchange chromatography
on a BioCAD SPRINT FPLC system (PerSeptive Biosystems). Protein was
loaded onto a Poros HQ/20 column (Applied Biosystems, 1.6 cm ×
10 cm) equilibrated in AEX buffer (25 mM Tris, 5% (v/v) glycerol,
pH 7.6) supplemented with 100 mM NaCl. The column was washed with
1 CV of equilibration buffer before development with a 100 mL linear
gradient from 100 to 700 mM NaCl in AEX buffer. YosR eluted in the
range of 350–450 mM NaCl (flow rate = 2 mL min–1) and TrxB in the range of 230–280 mM NaCl (flow rate = 1
mL min–1). Fractions containing TrxB were pooled
by activity, exchanged to 50 mM NaPi, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and concentrated
with an Amicon Ultra-15 YM30 centrifugal filter device (30000 MWCO).
Fractions containing YosR, as assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE, were pooled,
desalted, and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-15 YM-3 centrifugal
filter device. YosR was subjected to further purification using the
SEC method described for TrxA. Typical yields were 3 mg YosR g–1 cell paste and 0.4 mg TrxB g–1 cell
paste. Purity was assessed by 15% SDS-PAGE (, SI-Figure 1). The concentration of YosR was estimated
by ε280 of 11 000 M–1 cm–1 (DNASTAR Lasergene 8). The concentration of TrxB
was estimated with the BCA assay using BSA as a standard. The FAD content of TrxB was determined as previously
described. SAs of YosR and TrxB of ∼20–26
U/mg and 415 U/mg, respectively, were determined using the DTNB assay., One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing a ΔA412 of 1.0 min–1.,

Purification of NrdE
NrdE was purified as previously
described except that buffer supplementation with NaCl and an additional
anion exchange chromatographic step were introduced (see ).

Purification of holo-MeIII2-Y· (Me
= Fe or Mn) Subsequent to Cofactor Assembly
EDTA (pH 7.6)
to a final concentration of 5 mM was added to 1 mL of reconstituted
MeIII2-Y· NrdF (40 μM Mn-loaded protein
or 300 μM Fe-loaded protein, ∼0.6 Y·/β2). Subsequent steps were at 4 °C. Samples were mixed,
clarified by centrifugation (20817g, 2 min), and
loaded onto a MonoQ 10/100GL anion exchange column (GE Healthcare,
10 × 1 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5% (w/v) glycerol
and 100 mM NaCl. The column was washed with 1.3 CVs of equilibration
buffer before elution with a 100 mL linear gradient from 100 to 350
mM NaCl in Tris buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL min–1. Apo-/mismetalated NrdF eluted at 250–280 mM NaCl (peak 1,
Figure ) and holo-protein at 280–310
mM (peak 2, Figure ). Fractions (2 mL) containing
protein were identified by A280, and protein
from each peak was pooled, exchanged into storage buffer (50 mM HEPES,
5% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.6), and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15
YM30 centrifugal filters. Typical yields were 35–45% of MnIII2-Y· NrdF and 53–63% of FeIII2-Y· NrdF. Pooled fractions were analyzed for metal
content, Y· content, and activity as described subsequently.

Separation
of holo-MnIII2-Y· NrdF (A)
and holo-FeIII2-Y· NrdF (B) from apo-/mis-metalated
NrdFs by anion exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column. The material
eluting in the void volume in (A) is NrdIox. Peak 1 corresponds
to apo-/mis-metalated NrdF and 2 to holo-MeIII2-Y· NrdF.

Metal Analysis of NrdF
Mn concentrations were determined
using a Perkin-Elmer Analyst 600 atomic absorption spectrometer and
a standardized Mn solution from Fluka. Iron concentrations were determined
by the ferrozine assay.

Y· Determination
by EPR Spectroscopy
Spectra were
acquired at 77 K on a Bruker EMX-X band spectrometer using a liquid
N2 finger dewar. Acquisition parameters for the MnIII2-Y· and FeIII2-Y·
cofactors of NrdF were described previously. Spin quantification was carried out by comparing the double integral
of the signal intensity to that of a reference sample of E.
coli NrdB (417 μM Y·, 1.2 Y·/β2) as described previously.

Activity Assays
Assays were carried out in a final
volume of 200 μL containing: 0.5–1 μM MeIII2-Y· NrdF (Me = Fe or Mn), 1 equiv of NrdE, 3 mM
ATP, 1 mM [5-3H]-CDP (ViTrax, specific activity ≈
1100 cpm nmol–1), reductant [8–20 mM DTT
or 40 μM TrxA (8–20 U/mg) or YosR (20–26 U/mg),
0.4 μM TrxB (415 U/mg), and 1 mM NADPH], 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6,
15 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM EDTA at 37 °C. The reaction
was initiated by addition of [5-3H]-CDP. Aliquots (35 μL)
were removed over 4 min and quenched by incubation at 100 °C
for 2 min. The method of Steeper and Steuart was used to quantitate
dCDP. One unit of activity is the amount
of enzyme required to catalyze 1 nmol dCDP min–1. The effect of the allosteric effectors dATP (0.4 μM to 4
mM) or ATP (50 μM to 4 mM) on activity was carried out as described
above.

The concentration dependence of RNR activity using a
1:1 mixture of α and β was measured with subunit ratios
varying from 0.01–1 μM. At concentrations below 0.1 μM,
BSA was included in the assay solution to a final concentration of
0.2 mg/mL. These data were fit to eq  with
Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR).

Quaternary Structural Analysis of 1:1 Mixtures of α:β
Using Biophysical Methods
Anion Exchange Chromatography
NrdE
and MeIII2-Y· NrdF (Me = Fe or Mn, 1 Y·/β2, ∼3.6 Me3+/β2, 1450 U/mg
[MnIII2-Y·] or 125 U/mg [FeIII2-Y·]) were mixed in a 1:1 ratio at 5 μM in
50 mM HEPES, 5% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.6 in a total volume of 0.5–1
mL. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 min and at room temperature
for 10 min, followed by centrifugation (20817g, 1
min, 4 °C). All subsequent steps were at 4 °C. Samples were
injected onto a MonoQ anion exchange column equilibrated in 50 mM
Tris, pH 7.6, 5% (w/v) glycerol and 100 mM NaCl. The column was washed
with 1 CV of the equilibration buffer and then developed with a 160
mL linear gradient from 100 to 500 mM NaCl in Tris buffer at a flow
rate of 1 mL min–1 (, SI-Figure 2). Fractions (2 mL) containing protein
were identified by A280, pooled, exchanged
into storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 5% (w/v) glycerol), and
concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 YM30 centrifugal filter. The
metal content, radical content, and activity of the isolated complex
was measured as described above.

SEC
Samples of NrdE (3 μM), holo-FeIII2-Y·
NrdF (23 μM), holo-MnIII2-Y· NrdF
(1 μM), and 1:1 mixtures of α:β
(1 μM) in a total volume of 200 μL were centrifuged (20817g, 10 min, 4 °C) and then injected onto a Superdex
200 10/300 GL column (10 × 300 mm, ∼24 mL) connected to
an ÄKTA Purifier FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted
at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min–1 using
50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA.
Molecular weights were calculated as previously described using the experimentally measured s20,w (subsequent section), the Stokes radius (Rs) estimated from the SEC retention times, and
the correlation function of Laurent and Killander. The column was calibrated using a High Molecular Weight
Gel Filtration kit (GE Healthcare) containing the following standards:
Blue Dextran 2000 (void volume determination), thyroglobulin (669
kDa, Rs = 85.0 Å), ferritin (440
kDa, Rs = 61.0 Å), aldolase (158
kDa, Rs = 48.1 Å), conalbumin (75
kDa, Rs = 36.4 Å), and ovalbumin (44 kDa, Rs = 30.5 Å).

SV-AUC–Experimental
Design
Concentration-dependent
SV experiments were performed using a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge
at the MIT Biophysical Instrumentation Facility with Fe-β2 (1.2 Y·/β2, 4.0 Fe/β2, 130 U/mg), Mn-β2 (0.9 Y·/β2, 4.0 Mn/β2, 1545 U/mg), and α. Individual
subunits were analyzed in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 150
mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, whereas 1:1 mixtures of
α and β were analyzed in 50 mM NaPi, pH 7.6,
150 mM NaCl, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP to allow experiments to
be monitored by A230. Protein was exchanged
into buffer using three cycles of concentration-dilution with an Amicon
Ultra-15 YM30 centrifugal filter. The final filtrate was used as the
SV reference buffer. Samples spanning 0.1–1.5 OD at A230, A250, or A280 (SI-Table 3) were prepared in a total volume of 500 μL by mixing
concentrated protein solution with reference buffer to the desired
final concentration for each experiment. Epon charcoal double sector
cells (12 mm) assembled with quartz windows were loaded with ∼440
μL reference solution and ∼430 μL sample solution,
radially calibrated, and thermally equilibrated at 20 °C for
1.5–2.0 h prior to initiating the experiment. Sedimentation
was measured over 18–19 h with absorption detection at 20 °C
and an angular velocity of 35 000 rpm. Scans were collected
every 1.2 min using ProteomeLab XL-I Graphical User Interface, version
4.5b (Beckman).

Analysis
Method
Individual data sets
were fit with the c(s) model implemented in Sedfit with a resolution
(N) = 200–250, and a regularization factor
(P) = 0.95., Distributions were
converted to the standard state (s20,w) using a solvent density (ρ) = 1.018 g mL–1 (Tris buffer) or 1.023 g mL–1 (NaPi buffer), solvent viscosity (η) = 1.164 cP (Tris buffer) or
1.170 cP (NaPi buffer), and the partial specific volume
(v̅) of the species analyzed (, SI-Table 4); these values were calculated
and temperature corrected with Sednterp. All MnIII2-Y· NrdF data sets and the
NrdE and NrdE:FeIII2-Y· NrdF data collected
at physiological concentrations (∼1 μM) were fit with
the program Sedphat using the “hybrid local continuous/global
discrete species model” for a more rigorous determination of s20,w and Mw. The best fit s20,w for each species was used to determine Rs and the frictional ratio (f/fo) with Sednterp by turning off the temperature corrections,
setting ρ = 0.998 g mL–1 and η = 1.002
cP, and calculating the Mw values using
the amino acid sequences of NrdE and NrdF (including the His-tag).

Hydrodynamic Modeling
Predictions of
the s20,w, frictional ratio (f/fo), and Rs for each species were determined using the program HYDROPRO and structural models of NrdE and NrdF (PDB 4DRO) (, SI-Table 4). A crystallographic structure of B. subtilis NrdE
is not available, and therefore the web-based server PHYRE was used to generate a NrdE model by threading
onto the Salmonella typhimurium NrdE structure (PDB 1PEM, 45% identity to B. subtilis NrdE; see ).

SDS-PAGE Densitometry
The ratio of α:β
in 1:1 mixtures was estimated by densitometry using standard curves
prepared from known amounts of NrdE and NrdF as described previously. See  for details.

Results
Purification of MeIII2-Y· NrdF (Me
= Fe or Mn) to give 1 Y·/β2
The low
amounts of Y· and metal content in class Ib β subunits
examined to date suggest that NrdFs (, SI-Table 1) are heterogeneous mixtures of holo-
and apo-/mismetalated protein. On the basis of the report of partial
separation of Bacillus anthracis holo- and apo-NrdF,B. subtilis NrdF was examined
on different anion exchange resins with MonoQ ultimately effecting
complete separation of holo-Fe-β2 and Mn-β2 from apo-/mismetalated-NrdF (Figure ). Analysis of pooled peak 2 by atomic absorption and EPR spectroscopy
revealed 4.1 ± 0.3 Mn/β2 and 1.00 ± 0.09
Y·/β2 for MnIII2-Y·
NrdF and by ferrozine assay and EPR spectroscopy 4.0 ± 0.1 Fe/β2 and 1.05 ± 0.05 Y·/β2 for FeIII2Y· NrdF (, SI-Figure 3). In contrast,
pooled protein from peak 1 (Figure ) typically
had 0.1 Y·/β2, ∼1.0 metal/β2, and no detectable activity. Holo-NrdF from peak 2 has been
used in all subsequent experiments.

Purification of B. subtilis TrxA, YosR, and
TrxB
The highest activities of class I RNRs have been achieved
with endogenous reducing systems that are distinct for different class
Ib RNRs (see , SI-Table
1). Mining of B. subtilis JH624 genome revealed a number of candidate genes. Thioredoxin (trxA, TR), YosR (yosR, a NrdH or glutaredoxin-like
thioredoxin,), and thioredoxin reductase (trxB, TRR) were ultimately pursued due to homology to the
reductants that maximally supported RNR activity in B. anthracis., His-tagged versions of these genes were cloned, overexpressed
in E. coli, and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography.
Each protein required additional purification steps. For TrxA, Sephadex
G-75 SEC yielded ≥99% pure protein (, SI-Figure 1) with a specific activity of ∼11–20
U/mg using the DTNB assay in the presence of NADPH and TrxB. For YosR,
Poros HQ/20 FPLC anion exchange chromatography followed by Sephadex
G-75 SEC resulted in ≥95% pure protein (, SI-Figure 1) with a specific activity
of ∼20–26 U/mg. Finally, nearly homogeneous TrxB with
a full complement of FAD was obtained with Poros HQ/20 anion exchange
(≥95% pure, , SI-Figure 1) and had a specific activity of 415 U/mg in the presence
of either TrxA or YosR.

Assay Optimization
Historically,
the activity of each
subunit for class Ia RNRs has been assayed independently in the presence
of an excess of the second subunit due to weak subunit interactions., Similar assays of Ib RNRs have been carried out using this protocol.,,,,,, Our previous results, however, suggested the B. subtilis RNR could be assayed as a holo-enzyme by using
equivalent amounts of each subunit. To
validate the use of a 1:1 ratio of subunits, experiments were therefore
initially carried out using 0.5–1 μM NrdF, increasing
amounts of NrdE (1, 5, or 10 equiv), 3 mM ATP, and the endogenous
reductants TrxA/TrxB/NADPH. The results with both Fe- and Mn-loaded
NrdF in a 1:1 ratio with NrdE gave activity very similar to that in
the presence of a 5–10-fold excess of NrdE (data not shown).
Thus, all further studies used a 1:1 ratio of the subunits.

Optimization
of Effector (ATP, dATP) Concentrations
Previous studies of
the Fe-loaded S. typhimurium, Lactococcus
lactis, and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis class Ib RNRs reported that dATP strongly stimulated
CDP reduction, while ATP had only a marginal stimulatory affect.,,, These results contrast with the class Ia RNRs, in which dATP stimulates
activity by binding to the specificity site of α at low concentrations
and inhibits at high concentrations by binding to both the specificity
and activity site leading to an α4β4 inhibitory complex., This quaternary structure is
inaccessible in Ib RNRs as they lack the ATP cone domain essential
for α4β4 formation. Thus, studies with both ATP and dATP were carried out,
and the results are shown in Figure . ATP
maximally stimulated CDP reduction at 1.5–2 mM, while dATP
showed maximal stimulation at 8–10 μM followed by rapid
inhibition at higher concentrations. The effects were similar with
Fe-loaded NrdF (data not shown), although the activity was 5-fold
lower. The dATP behavior was unexpected as there is no ATP cone domain,
and it is distinct from other reported class Ib enzymes.,,, The Mg2+ dependence was also examined and gave an optimum
activity at 10–15 mM, while EDTA had no effect on the activity
(data not shown).

Effector nucleotide concentration-dependence of CDP reduction

a 1:1 mixture of MnIII2-Y· NrdF and NrdE.
Assays were conducted with 0.5 μM of each subunit. Error bars
represent ±1 standard deviation from the mean. (A) Dependence
of B. subtilis RNR activity on ATP. (B) Dependence
of B. subtilis RNR activity on dATP.

The SA of B. subtilis RNR under
optimized conditions
with CDP/(d)ATP is among the highest reported for any member of this
subclass (Table ; , SI-Table 1). Holo-MnIII2-Y· and FeIII2-Y· NrdF gave, respectively,
1475 ± 129 and 125 ± 23 U/mg with TrxA and 997 ± 9
U/mg and 106 ± 8 U/mg with YosR (Table ). Given that we believe both cluster loading and reductant identity
are important contributors to RNR activity, we compared the activities
of purified and unpurified MeIII2-Y· NrdF
using both DTT and TrxA/TrxB/NADPH to establish the relative contributions
of each factor to the overall activity enhancement observed with B. subtilis RNR. Surprisingly, the use of the endogenous
reducing system had a much greater effect on activity (5–10-fold
enhancement with MnIII2-Y·) than did cluster
assembly (0–2-fold enhancement, Table ). This starkly contrasts with the B. anthracis RNR,
where similar activities were observed with DTT and Trx1.

Reconstitution of Active
RNR from Recombinant NrdE and Reconstituted
NrdF
The most distinct aspect of the copurification of endogenous
NrdE and NrdF was that the complex was maintained in the absence of
substrates, effectors, and Mg2+. Analysis of a 1:1 mixture NrdE:NrdF (5 μM) on a MonoQ FPLC
column reproduced this result (, SI-Figure 2). A single peak eluted between 380–410 mM NaCl,
behavior distinct from NrdE alone (two peaks that eluted between 265–300
mM NaCl and 325–340 mM NaCl) and reconstituted NrdF (two peaks
that eluted in the range of 250–280 mM NaCl and 280–310
mM NaCl) using the same NaCl gradient. SDS-PAGE densitometry analysis
of the fractions showed a 1:1 subunit ratio (, SI-Figure 4). Both the recovered Fe- and Mn-loaded
complexes were active in CDP reduction (116 ± 5 U/mg and 889
± 6 U/mg, respectively) and contained a nearly full complement
of metal (Fe/β2 = 3.8 ± 0.2; Mn/β2 = 3.8 ± 1.6) and Y· (Fe-β2 = 1.2
Y·/β2, Mn-β2 = 0.7 Y·/β2).

Km for α/β
Interaction
Recent Western blot analysis of wild type B. subtilis JH624 using antibodies to NrdE and NrdF revealed
that the two proteins
were present in the crude cell extracts in a 1:1 subunit ratio at
∼1 μM. Thus, CDP reductase
activity using a 1:1 subunit ratio was examined with subunit concentrations
that ranged from 0.01 μM to 1 μM in the presence of ATP
(3 mM) and TrxA/TrxB/NADPH. The results are shown in Figure . Fitting the data to eq  gave Vmax = 124 ± 6 U/mg and Km = 0.06 ± 0.01 μM for Fe-β2 and Vmax = 1081 ± 36 U/mg
and Km = 0.025 ± 0.003 μM for
Mn-β2. The apparent affinity between the subunits
is ∼10× greater than for the class Ia RNRs and the B. anthracis class Ib RNR.,,

Quaternary Structure by
SEC
SEC was used initially
to estimate the molecular weights of the subunits and quaternary structure(s)
of holo-RNR. When run at physiological concentrations (∼1 μM),
NrdF (Fe- or Mn-loaded) eluted predominantly as a single peak (Figure A) with a molecular weight of 80.1 kDa (Table ), consistent with a dimer. A small amount of monomer
was also observed (49.6 kDa, Table ). NrdE
also eluted as a single peak (Figure A) with
a molecular weight of 82.7 kDa (Table ), consistent
with a monomer. The results with holo-RNR are shown in Figure B. The chromatogram reveals a series of broad peaks
with retention times ranging from 37–60 min, indicating the
presence of interconverting species. Regardless of the metal loading,
the highest percentage of protein eluted at Ve = 47 min, corresponding to a molecular weight of 204.6 kDa
(Table ), suggesting, in conjunction with
the other hydrodynamic properties, the presence of an α2β2-like complex with a structure similar
to the elongated S. typhimurium class Ib holo-RNR
(Table ). However,
these results clearly indicate that the quaternary structure(s) of
the B. subtilis class Ib RNR are not stable in the
absence of substrate or effector nucleotides, resulting in an ensemble
of different interconverting species, despite the low experimentally
measured Km (Figure ).

Quaternary Structure by
SV-AUC
SV experiments with
each subunit and with a 1:1 mixture of subunits were carried out at
different concentrations (, SI-Table 3) to gain further insight into their quaternary states.
To aid in the analysis of our experimental data, HYDROPRO was used to predict hydrodynamic properties
for NrdF and NrdE from the NrdF crystal structure (PDB 4DRO) and a threading model of NrdE using the S. typhimurium NrdE structure (PDB 1PEM). Predictions were also
made for docking models of the B. subtilis α2β2 complex prepared by in silico alignment of the subunit models with the E. coli class Ia RNR globular docking model and the elongated X-ray structure
of the S. typhimurium class Ib holo-RNR., The results of the HYDROPRO calculations are summarized in , SI-Table 4.

The
sedimentation behavior of MnIII2-Y· NrdF
(1–11 μM), NrdE (1–30 μM), and NrdE:FeIII2-Y· NrdF (25 nM to 7 μM) were determined
and analyzed using the c(s) model in Sedfit and, due to the detection
by the c(s) fits of interactions occurring on the time scale of sedimentation,
with Sedphat. The details of these analyses are presented in the  and in SI-Figures 5–7.
The results for 1 μM MnIII2-Y· NrdF
are shown in Figure C and reveal two peaks
representing stable, noninteracting entities at all concentrations
examined (, SI-Figure
5). Globally fitting the data sets in Sedphat yielded s20,w = 3.64 and 4.72 S for each entity, along with the
corresponding Mw’s listed in Table . These results, in comparison with HYDROPRO predictions
(, SI-Table 4) and
SEC results (Table ), suggest that the predominant
species is a dimer and the minor species is a monomer. These results
are consistent with the general reports that all class I small subunits
are dimers.

The results of similar experiments with NrdE are
shown in Figure C and , SI-Figure 6. At 1 μM NrdE, a
single peak with an s20,w = 5.56 S is
observed. However, analysis
of increasing protein concentrations to 9 μM reveal a second
peak at s20,w = 7.40 S (, SI-Figure 6A) and at still higher
concentrations (30 μM), larger oligomeric states (, SI-Figure 6B). Thus,
NrdE is in a regime where the protein is not stable and aggregates
on the time scale of our experiments. The NrdE data analyzed in Sedphat,
when compared to the HYDROPRO predictions (, SI-Table 4) and our SEC data (Table ), suggest that the peak at low concentrations is the NrdE
monomer. As the protein concentration increases NrdE appears to form
a dimer that is unstable and continues to aggregate (, SI-Figure 6). We note that α,
in prokaryotic and eukaryotic class Ia RNRs, in general exhibits low
solubility and that aggregation has been reported by SAXS and EM analyses. However, ours is the first systematic report
of the complexity of α aggregation.

The analysis of a
1:1 mixture NrdE:FeIII2-Y· NrdF using c(s)
is shown in Figure D (also see , SI-Figure
7). Even at 1 μM, dynamic behavior of the subunits is indicated
by the reaction boundary that has apparent peaks at 4.38 and 9.66
S. A plot of the best fit f/fo from the c(s) models versus loading concentration (Figure E) reveals a sharp decrease as the protein concentration
increases. As described in more detail in the , this observation indicates the presence
of interconverting species. The data were imported into Sedphat, and
the peaks were treated as discrete species with individual f/fo. The calculated hydrodynamic properties of the smaller species (s20,w = 3.64 S) are consistent with a NrdF monomer.
For the larger species (s20,w = 9.59 S),
the analysis suggests the presence of oligomeric structures that are
similar to, but smaller than, that predicted for an α2β2 complex (, SI-Table 4). As noted however, this is clearly not a discrete species
as this peak shifts to larger s20,w, and
larger complex(es) of unknown composition become evident as the protein
concentration increases (Figure F, , SI-Figure 7). Thus, we
currently do not have a model for the behavior of the 1:1 NrdE:NrdF
complex. Further analysis requires the presence of different substrate
and effector pairs after their binding stoichiometries are established
and requires development of a method to specifically reduce the Y·
in NrdF to prevent chemistry during the analysis.

Discussion
In 2010, it was shown
that class Ib RNRs can assembly a MnIII2-Y·
cofactor with the aid of the unusual
flavodoxin NrdI and O2in vitro and that enzymes isolated from three endogenous
sources have a similar cluster.,, More recently, in vitro assembly of a MnIII2-Y· cofactor using species specific NrdIs have been
carried out in B. subtilis,,Streptococcus sanguinis,B. anthracis, and B. cereus() with similar results. The interesting observation
that a FeIII2-Y· cofactor can self-assemble
in these enzymes in vitro and maintain catalytic
activity, although demonstrably lower than the Mn-loaded cofactor
(, SI-Table 1),−,, raises important biological questions as to the nature of the active
cofactor in vivo and whether it changes with the
growth conditions of the organism. Given that many pathogenic organisms () require a class Ib RNR for aerobic growth and
that humans use a FeIII2-Y· class Ia RNR,
the distinctions in the mechanisms of cofactor biosynthesis, allosteric
regulation, and quaternary structure offer new opportunities for therapeutic
intervention. Thus, understanding the basic properties of the Ib RNRs,
as well as their similarities and differences to one another and to
class Ia RNRs, is an important first step.

Recent studies on
the class Ib RNRs (with the MnIII2-Y· NrdF)
from B. anthracis and B. cereus have
identified and characterized the endogenous
reductants required to make deoxynucleotides at optimum rates., Despite this important contribution, however, these and other class
Ib RNRs (, SI-Table
1) still have low catalytic activity. The B. anthracis MnIII2-Y· NrdF assembled with NrdI gave
0.3–0.4 Y·/β2, but the reported activity
was only 44–70 U/mg., Similar activities
were observed using DTT (40–63 U/mg) alone or with either TR
or NrdH., The B. anthracis FeIII2-Y· NrdF with 0.6 Y·/β2 was reported to have activity of only 8 U/mg. This value is very low given the high Y· content,
which in the case of the Ia RNRs, is correlated with activity. Our initial report on the activity of endogenous B. subtilis RNR using DTT as reductant was also low, 160
U/mg. To study the class Ib RNRs, we thus felt that we needed to better
understand the basis for the low catalytic activity, which we believed
to lie with cluster assembly in NrdF and the reductant used to support
NDP reduction. Our studies show that apo-/mismetalated forms of NrdF
can be separated from holo-protein, yielding MnIII2-Y· NrdF with 1 Y·/β2 and 4 Mn/β2. Contrary to our expectations, the purity of MeIII2-Y· NrdF was only a minor factor in activity enhancement
(Table ). Rather, the identity of the reductant
used to support turnover was the major limiting factor in obtaining
highly active RNR from B. subtilis. The optimum endogenous reducing system was TR/TRR/NADPH,
which supported catalytic activity of ∼1450 U/mg. However,
the major contributor to high enzymatic activity may vary from species
to species, given that with B. anthracis, Trx1 and
DTT yielded similar activities using poorly loaded MnIII2-NrdF. The basis for the
low activity in the B. anthracis system is likely
associated with mismetalated NrdFs which interfere with formation
of an active RNR complex.

The availability of highly active B. subtilis NrdF
and NrdE have allowed us to assemble an active RNR with a 1:1 ratio
of subunits and to analyze the resulting activity in physiological
concentration ranges (Figure ). The Km of 0.025 μM contrasts with values of
∼0.2 μM measured for the Ia RNR subunits, in which each
subunit is assayed independently in the presence of a 5–10-fold
excess of the second subunit to generate the “active”
complex., All the assays on the B. anthracis RNR were carried out using the class Ia method., These conditions could alter quaternary structures (α and
α/β structures) and result in inhibition under these assay
conditions (see discussion below). With bacterial systems, we now
believe that all assays of enzymatic activity should be carried out
with a 1:1 ratio of the two subunits, accompanied by a study to establish
the optimum concentration range for maximum active complex formation
with each RNR.

Two issues warrant further discussion of our
results with B. subtilis in comparison those with B. anthracis (and B. cereus) Ib RNRs: the
nature of the endogenous
reductant(s), and the nature and dynamics of
their quaternary structure(s). In the studies of Gustafsson et al.,
interrogation of the B. anthracis genome identified
three thioredoxins, two potential thioredoxin reductases, and three
potential glutaredoxin-like proteins all of which were cloned, expressed,
and screened for their ability to support RNR activity. The turnover numbers for the B. anthracis RNR were highest with Trx1/TR1 and 7-fold greater than with NrdH/TR1
(, SI-Table 1). Furthermore,
under their growth conditions, Western analysis revealed that Trx1
was the predominant RNR reductant in the cell.

We used the B. anthracis genes as queries of the B. subtilis genome and
identified six thioredoxin-like proteins (TrxA, Ydbp, YtpP, YdfQ,
YusE, and YusI), one thioredoxin reductase (TrxB), and two glutaredoxin-like
proteins (YosR and BdbA). TrxA and TrxB are homologues of B. anthracis Trx1 (75% identity) and TR1 (87% identity),
suggesting they likely function as the reducing system for the B. subtilis RNR. In addition, previous gene knock-out experiments
of all of these proteins and the growth of the resulting deletion
mutants in rich or minimal medium revealed that only TrxA and TrxB
are essential., Using these purified proteins,
we established that endogenous reductants effect a ∼10-fold
increase on RNR activity relative to DTT (Table ) in contrast with the B. anthracis RNR. We also note that we have observed a 20-fold
difference between endogenous reductant and DTT with the S.
sanguinis class Ib RNR.

It was pointed out previously that B. subtilis has
a second class Ib RNR, located in the bnrdEFI operon,
which could potentially be physiologically important. The gene yosR, recently reannotated
as nrdH, is adjacent to this operon,, prompting us to examine this protein in our assays as well. As was
observed with the B. anthracis RNR, YosR(NrdH) exhibits
activity similar to TrxA in ribonucleotide reduction (Table ). In B anthracis, as noted above,
Western analysis suggested that TrxA was the endogenous reductant.
Previous studies in B. subtilis have established
that the bnrdEFI operon is dispensable for its survival
under numerous growth conditions,,, supported by transcriptional analysis under rich
and minimal growth conditions in which both yosR and bnrdEFI were expressed at very low levels. Thus, TrxA is most likely the physiological reductant in B. subtilis as well.

The most interesting observation
from our studies is associated
with our analysis of quaternary structure. We expected tight subunit
association in the absence of nucleotides (dNTPs), based on our isolation
of endogenous B. subtilis RNR and the concentration dependence of activity (Figure ), in contrast to the class Ia RNRs (Kd of 0.4 μM)., Our studies using SEC
and SV-AUC, however, revealed that this is not the case (Figure ). Under physiological concentrations (1 μM)
with no nucleotides, both methods revealed mixtures of subunits and
complexes of subunits. GEMMA analysis of the B. anthracis class Ib RNR in the absence of nucleotides also revealed mixtures
of subunits and an α2β2 complex. In neither our case, nor in the case of these
earlier studies, however has a study of affinities and the rates for
subunit association and dissociation been carried out.

Finally,
the observation of potent inhibition of RNR activity by
dATP given the absence of an ATP cone domain deserves comment. The
results are distinct from all class Ib RNRs reported to date, which
show no inhibition even at concentrations of 1 mM dATP.,,,, Furthermore, with dATP and the B.
anthracis RNR, the GEMMA analysis revealed individual subunits,
αβ2, and α2β2, but no large quaternary states were reported. Thus, the cause for the potent inhibition with the B. subtilis RNR requires further study.

Our studies,, suggest that the paradigm of
RNR as α2β2 in the literature needs
to be re-examined. The difficulties
associated with obtaining structures of prokaryotic RNRs with both
subunits present are likely associated with the dynamics of their
interactions. Undoubtedly these dynamics will be affected by the presence
of ATP, dNTPs, and Mg2+, and studies of these effects under
physiologically relevant conditions are currently in progress. In
order to carry out these types of studies, highly active protein with
fully loaded metallo-cofactor is essential, and our studies reported
herein present the foundation to investigate quaternary structure
and its connection to the enzymatic activity and allosteric regulation
of RNRs.
