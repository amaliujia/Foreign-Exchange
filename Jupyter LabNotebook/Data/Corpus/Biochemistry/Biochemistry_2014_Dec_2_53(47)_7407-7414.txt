Connexin
proteins form hexameric assemblies known as hemichannels.
When docked to form gap junction (GJ) channels, hemichannels play
a critical role in cell–cell communication and cellular homeostasis,
but often are functional entities on their own in unapposed cell membranes.
Defects in the Connexin26 (Cx26) gene are the major cause of hereditary
deafness arising from dysfunctional hemichannels in the cochlea. Structural
studies of Cx26 hemichannels properly trafficked and inserted in plasma
membranes, including their clustering that forms a plaque-like feature
in whole gap junctions, are limited. We used atomic force microscopy
(AFM) to study the surface topography of Cx26 hemichannels using two
different membrane preparations. Rat Cx26 containing appended carboxy
terminal V5 and hexahistidine tags were expressed in baculovirus/Sf9
cell systems. The expressed Cx26 proteins form hemichannels in situ
in Sf9 cells that were then purified either as (1) Sf9 membrane fragments
containing Cx26 hemichannels or (2) solubilized hemichannels. The
latter were subsequently reconstituted in liposomes. AFM images of
purified membrane fragments showed clusters of protein macromolecular
structures in the membrane that at higher magnification corresponded
to Cx26 hemichannels. Hemichannels reconstituted into DOPC bilayers
displayed two populations of channel heights likely resulting from
differences in orientations of inserted hemichannels. Hemichannels
in the protein rich portions of purified membranes also showed a reduced
channel height above the bilayer compared to membranes with reconstituted
hemichannels perhaps due to reduced AFM probe access to the lipid
bilayer. These preparations of purified membranes enriched for connexin
hemichannels that have been properly trafficked and inserted in membranes
provide a platform for high-resolution AFM imaging of the structure,
interconnexon interactions, and cooperativity of properly trafficked
and inserted noncrystalline connexin hemichannels.

The connexin (Cx) family of
proteins is a group of ubiquitously expressed transmembrane proteins
with high conservation of structure and genetics between species.
Cx proteins form assemblies in the cell plasma membranes known as
hemichannels (or connexons) consisting of 6 Cx subunits. Hemichannels
on apposing cells dock together to form gap junction (GJ) channels
that facilitate cell–cell communication through transport of
ions, metabolites, and other small molecules between neighboring cells.
Undocked hemichannels have been shown to be present in cells1 and have demonstrated ionic conductance states
as well as metabolite, dye, and Ca2+ transfer.2−6 Gating of hemichannel and GJ channel activity is regulated by many
factors, including Ca2+, pH, phosphorylation, and redox
state.7−10 During oxidative stress, hemichannels lose regulation leading to
unchecked hemichannel opening that ultimately results in cell death.11,12 To better understand the structures that determine the activity
of hemichannels, imaging of these structures within membrane environments
must be performed.

Previous imaging has extensively revealed
subnanometer resolution
3-D structures of Cx hemichannels and GJ channels using X-ray crystallography,
X-ray diffraction, and electron crystallography.13−17 All are based on crystallized or quasi-crystallized
arrangements of GJ channels. In contrast, atomic force microscopy
(AFM) allows high resolution imaging of noncrystalline biological
samples in aqueous, nonstatic environments. Previously, high resolution
AFM images of the extracellular surface of Cx26 hemichannels derived
from force dissected quasi-crystalline dodecameric channels showed
fine details and conformational changes in response to either Ca2+ or low pH.18,19 However, native undocked hemichannels
exist in noncrystalline clusters and populations are often diffuse
in the native membrane environment. The open and closed states of
Cx43 and Cx40 hemichannels reconstituted in lipid bilayers contained
noncrystalline patches of membrane bound hemichannels that showed
Ca2+ induced conformational changes when exposed to high
Ca2+ concentrations.20,21 However, reconstitution
of hemichannels does not always mimic the native composition of eukaryotic
plasma membranes and can have widely varying protein densities. It
also lacks the cellular control for correct, directed trafficking
and insertion of hemichannels into membranes. In order to overcome
this limitation, we have utilized purified membrane fragments from
cells expressing Cx26 hemichannels at high levels.

In this study,
we focused on imaging of noncrystalline Cx26 hemichannels,
which allows for easier high resolution imaging due to their shorter
cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Connexins share a common topology with
high sequence conservation in their N-terminus, transmembrane domains,
and extracellular loops. Connexins larger than 40 kDa have C-termini
that contain as much mass as the transmembrane and extracellular domains
combined. The amino acid sequences of the connexin C-termini vary
considerably, with each containing critical regulatory regions essential
to channel function. The cytoplasmic domains are very flexible and
probably act similarly to intrinsically disordered proteins.22 This inherent flexibility has made imaging high
resolution structural details difficult.

Here, we report AFM
imaging of noncrystalline Cx26-V5-His6 hemichannels expressed
through baculovirus infected Sf9 insect cells.
We take advantage of the fact that connexins readily form hemichannels
or channels in the membranes of baculovirus infected Sf9 cells that
allow for purification of milligram quantities of hemichannels. It
is important to emphasize that we studied Cx26 not only for its short
C-terminus, but also because genetic defects in the human gjbeta2
gene (Cx26) are the leading cause of the most common type of hereditary
congenital hearing impairment due to altered structure that can prevent
docking of hemichannels or alter trafficking of molecules through
the channels.23−25 We used purified membrane fragments of Sf9 cells
containing Cx26 hemichannels to image the structure of dispersed hemichannels
in membranes and compared these to images of purified hemichannels
reconstituted in 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DOPC) liposomes. The hemichannels expressed in the purified membrane
fraction of cells showed regions of clustering. The protrusion of
hemichannels above the membrane was reduced in comparison to the reconstituted
hemichannel preparations.

Experimental Procedures
Baculovirus Expression
of Hemichannels in Insect Cells
Rat Cx26-V5-His6 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_001004099.1)
was expressed through cloning into a pBlueBac baculovirus system as
previously described in Beahm et al.26 Baculoviruses
were generated and used for subsequent infection of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The techniques
for applying this to expression of connexin hemichannels have been
described extensively in our previous publications.24,26−28

Insect Cell Membrane Purification
In Sf9 cells, Cx26
readily forms channels and hemichannels in the plasma membrane and
internal membranes. Hemichannel expressing Sf9 cell membranes were
purified using our published protocol.27

Hemichannel Purification
Solubilized hemichannel proteins
were purified from baculovirus expression in Sf9 cells utilizing the
hexahistidine tag for affinity purification, as we have previously
reported.13,24,26,27,29

Reconstitution of Hemichannels
1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine
(DOPC) lipids (Avanti Polar
Lipids, Alabaster, AL) (5 mg/mL) in chloroform were vacuum-dried.
The lipids were then resuspended in 150 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1.8 mM
MgCl2 buffer (pH 7.5) (final DOPC concentration of 0.8
mg/mL) with n-octyl-β-d-glucoside
(OG) (5 mg/mL). The mixture was briefly vortexed followed by 15 min
of sonication to create mixed detergent–lipid liposomes. Purified
Cx26-V5-His6 hemichannels in elution buffer were added
at 1:200 to the liposomes. The mixture was sonicated for 2 min and
then gently mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. The detergent was removed
to create proteoliposomes by treatment with Biobeads (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA) (0.1 g/mL) twice for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C.

AFM Imaging of Hemichannels
Imaging was performed on
a multimode atomic force microscope with a Nanoscope IIIA or Nanoscope
V controller utilizing a fluid cell (all from Bruker, Santa Barbara,
CA). A TRP300A cantilever (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA) with
spring constants 0.02 N/m (contact mode) and 0.08 N/m (tapping mode)
was used for all imaging. For imaging of the reconstituted hemichannels,
proteoliposomes were deposited on freshly cleaved mica (20 μL)
and allowed to attach for 30 min. The sample was heated for 5 min
at 37 °C to induce liposomal fusion. The sample was then rinsed
3 times with “imaging buffer” (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM PMSF,
pH 7.4) and then imaged in appropriate buffer. For imaging of membrane
fragments containing hemichannels, 20 μL of the Sf9 membrane
suspension was deposited on mica. The mica had been incubated with
“pretreatment buffer” (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.5)
that we found reduced rolling or folding of the flexible membranes.
After a 10 min incubation to allow absorption of the membrane fragments
onto the mica, samples were rinsed twice in “pretreatment buffer”
and then rinsed in an imaging buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4)
just prior to imaging in the buffer. Images were taken with raster
scans at rates between 1 and 2 Hz for tapping mode images and 5–10
Hz for contact mode. The samples were imaged with scan sizes ranging
from 10 μm × 10 μm to 100 nm × 100 nm. High
resolution images were taken with pixel sizes less than 1 nm.

Gel and
Western Blots
Isolated membranes and purified
hemichannels were checked for purity by gel staining for protein bands
and Western blots. Between 5 and 15 μL of sample were mixed
with 2x Novex Tricine SDS Buffer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA
LC1676) in the presence of 5% BME. The samples were boiled for 10
min and loaded on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. For
protein staining, the gels were then fixed and stained with SYPRO
Ruby solution (Life Technologies S-12000) overnight. For Western blots,
the gels were transferred to PVDF membrane using the iBlot dry blotting
system. Band detection was performed using the Li-Cor Odyssey Fc (Li-Cor
Biosciences, Inc., Lincoln, NE) after reaction with ECL Luminata Forte
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Analysis of Lipid Bilayers
Containing Cx26 Hemichannels
Lipid bilayers were deposited
on mica substrates following the procedure
described for preparing reconstituted hemichannels for AFM imaging.
The mica substrate was broken into pieces and put into 1.5 mL Eppendorf
tubes. Twenty microliters of loading sample buffer, Novex Tricine
SDS Sample Buffer (Life Technologies) mixed with 5% BME, was added
to the tubes. The tubes were then boiled for 10 min in a thermo block
and loaded on an SDS gel PAGE 4–20% acrylamide for Western
blotting. Band detection was performed with an anti-His primary antibody
(Life Technologies) and an anti-mouse fluorescent secondary antibody
and imaged by an Odyssey Fc instrument.

Electron Microscopy
Samples of isolated membranes (5
μL) were applied to carbon coated grids, rinsed with ddH20, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and then air-dried.
Electron microscopy (EM) was performed by using a 120 kV FEI Tecnai
transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). Images were
acquired at 30 000 magnification using a TVIPS TemCam-F224
2k × 2k CCD camera (TVIPS, Gauting, Germany).

Data Analysis
of AFM Data
Images were initially processed
using the Nanoscope Analysis 1.4 software package (Bruker, Santa Barbara,
CA) to apply image flattening to correct for piezotube motion artifacts
and a low pass Gaussian filter to eliminate electrical and mechanical
noise. We used the Origin Pro 7.5 software package (OriginLabs, Northampton,
MA) to determine the mean bilayer heights by plotting a histogram
of the pixel heights and then fitting Gaussian curves to each histogram
to determine the peak and standard deviation of the distributions.
All subsequent statistical analyses were also performed with Origin
Pro 7.5. All statistical values are reported as mean ± standard
deviation.

Results
Baculovirus Sf9 infected
cells are an excellent system for expressing
eukaryotic proteins in quantities typically required for structural
biology experiments. In the case of connexins, the protein subunits
oligomerize to form hexamers or dodecamers in situ that have been
shown to be structurally and functionally the same as proteins expressed
exogenously in other cells or in native systems.3 The resulting hemichannels were either (1) recovered in
the membrane fragment fraction of the expressing cells or (2) solubilized
from cell membranes and purified as detergent stabilized hemichannels.

EM and
Biochemical Validation of Purified Membranes Containing
Hemichannels
Protocols for purifying GJs depend on the fact
that the intrinsic protein to lipid ratio is high in these membrane
specializations and increased after detergents extractions, making
density gradient separation methods effective for isolating highly
enriched fractions containing GJs. Hemichannel-containing membranes
also had a high protein to lipid ratio, and thus, these same methods
yield good results for our hemichannel membranes as well.30 To purify membranes containing Cx26 hemichannels,
partially disrupted membranes were collected utilizing a membrane
selective sucrose gradient followed by washing with detergents. Because
density gradient fractionation is selective for overall density but
not for protein composition, we concentrated and further enriched
membrane fragment fractions containing high density expressions of
Cx26 by taking advantage of the genetically appended His6 tag binding to Ni-NTA beads for affinity separation.

Following
successful purification of membrane fragments containing hemichannels,
the membrane fragments were imaged with EM (Figure 1). Electron micrographs of uranyl acetate stained purified
membrane fragments show the presence of hemichannel structures (Figure 1B) whose appearance in these projection images we
previously referred to as “doughnut-like”. Gel staining
and Western blotting of these membranes confirmed the presence of
Cx26 proteins in the purified membrane fraction (Figure 1C,D).

Cx26 expressing Sf9 cells. (A,B) Representative electron micrographs
of uranyl acetate stained purified membranes without Cx26 expression
(uninfected) (A) and with Cx26 expression (B). The inset in (B) shows
a “doughnut-like” hemichannel structure present in the
membrane (circled in white). (C,D) Protein staining (C) and Western
blots (D) confirmed the presence of Cx26 in these preparations, while
a similar analysis of uninfected cells did not contain any Cx26 bands.
Oligomeric forms of Cx26 in the sample are due to protein aggregation
when running the gel and are overemphasized in the Western blot.

Membranes from uninfected Sf9
cells were imaged as a negative control.
In this case, we did not use a Ni-NTA affinity purification step because
there was no His6 tag expressed in this sample. No doughnut-like
structures were seen in these uranyl-acetate stained membranes. Furthermore,
only trace amounts of proteins were found within these membranes (Figure 1C) and none of these very faint bands were identified
as Cx26 in matched Western blots (Figure 1D).

AFM of Purified Membrane Fragments with Cx26 Hemichannels
Purified membranes of Sf9 cells expressing Cx26 were deposited
onto freshly cleaved mica and imaged in aqueous buffer (Figure 2). Membrane fragments greater than 500 nm in diameter
were further imaged at high resolution to examine the Cx26 structure.
Smaller bilayers were more susceptible to membrane disruption when
imaged and thus, high resolution images of these proved difficult
to record. Since the AFM z-resolution is very accurate,
it was easy to identify single layers from double layers or folded
membranes; heights greater than 12 nm were most likely either due
to the presence of GJs (double membranes containing two docked hemichannels)
or due to the superposition of hemichannel layers that occurred during
sample deposition, respectively. Some of the bilayer fragments displayed
inhomogeneity throughout the surface as cross section showed distinct
clusters with two populations of bilayer thickness (Figure 2A–D), while other fragments showed more homogeneous
height profiles (Figure 2E). The membrane in
Figure 2E contained small protein-rich islands
in a lipidic membrane. The height difference between the two populations
in the membranes exhibiting multiple heights was measured by first
finding the pixel height in localized regions (outlined in Figure 3) and then plotting the heights as a histogram (Figure 3). Gaussian distributions fit to each histogram
better quantified the height of the two bilayer populations. The height
of the bilayers in the lower population was 5.9 ± 1.6 nm, which
were not statistically different from the heights measured for the
homogeneous membrane population 5.2 ± 0.6 nm (t test, p &gt; 0.05). The step height difference
between
the lipidic and protein rich regions in the membranes was determined
to be 1.8 ± 0.4 nm (n = 6 measurements). The
regions of the bilayer displaying an increased thickness, we believe,
contain greater concentrations of hemichannels. Magnified images of
the membrane patches showed the presence of hemichannels dispersed
throughout the membranes (Figure 4). The protrusion
height of these hemichannels above the surrounding protein and lipid
was limited to 0.4 ± 0.2 nm (n = 18). The dense
packing and overall increased height in the step regions most likely
contributed to this lower protrusion height of the hemichannels.

(A–E) Purified Cx26 hemichannel containing fragments were deposited
on the mica substrate and imaged. Shown here are several AFM images
of large (&gt;500 nm) purified membrane fragments containing Cx26
hemichannels.
The height profile section of the membrane (white line) is shown below
its corresponding image. Note the difference in thickness between
the purely lipidic domains and hemichannel containing regions. In

different orientations and lipidic regions (arrow).

EM and Biochemical Validation of Purified Detergent Stabilized
Hemichannels
In our comparison of two ways of making hemichannel-containing
membranes, we used purified hemichannels collected from baculovirus
membranes via full membrane disruption and detergent solubilization.
The DoDM detergent stabilizes membrane proteins to allow them to retain
their structure and prevent aggregation. Detergent stabilized hemichannels
were imaged with EM with uranyl acetate as the contrast agent (Figure 5). These channels were present in “doughnut-like”
structures typical of hemichannels. Protein staining and Western blotting
of SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of Cx26 hemichannels as the primary
constituent of the purified lysate. This evidence confirmed the successful
purification of hexamer hemichannels for eventual reconstitution and
imaging with AFM (Figure 4).

Cx26 expressing Sf9 cells. (A) Electron micrograph of a uranyl-acetate
stained Cx26 hemichannel preparation typically used for reconstitution
into DOPC vesicles. (B) Staining an SDS PAGE with Sypro Ruby for protein
content confirmed the presence of a strong Cx26 band in this sample
that is further verified by Western blotting (C). Oligomeric forms
of Cx26 in the sample are due to protein aggregation when running
the gel and are overemphasized in the Western blot.

AFM Of Cx26 Hemichannels Reconstituted into
Lipid Membranes
As we did for the isolated membrane preparations,
we compared hemichannel
containing reconstituted membranes to ones prepared without hemichannels.
Prior to imaging bilayers formed by the proteoliposomes, bilayers
formed from liposomes containing only DOPC were imaged to measure
their size, heights, and surface structure. We used DOPC for hemichannel
reconstitution because these lipids have a very low phase transition
temperature (−17 °C), which facilitates the facile formation
of bilayers, as has been previously documented.13,20,21,29 These lipid
bilayers showed a step height of ∼5.5 nm (data not shown),
consistent with dimensions from the literature on DOPC bilayer thickness.31

Next, we imaged Cx26 hemichannels reconstituted
into DOPC lipid bilayers. Purified Cx26 hemichannels were reconstituted
in mixed DOPC/OG liposomes. The DoDM and OG were subsequently removed
with polystyrene beads. The DOPC proteoliposomes were deposited on
mica and imaged with AFM in the presence of calcium free buffers to
ensure open configurations of the hemichannels (Figure 6). The presence of hemichannel proteins in the liposomes was
confirmed by Western blots of the deposited liposomes (Figure 6D). These hemichannels were solely from the lipidic
membranes on the mica since extensive washing of the sample in the
AFM chamber was performed, thus removing any hemichannels in solution
prior to this analysis.

Figure 6 Cx26 hemichannels reconstituted in DOPC liposomes
and deposited
on mica to form flat membranes. (A–C) Hemichannels were observed
in DOPC bilayers with insets showing zoomed images of the hemichannels
(location indicated by cyan arrow, scale bar is 2 nm). (D) The presence
of Cx26 in the liposomes was confirmed with a Western blot of liposomes
deposited on the mica substrate. (E) Membrane patches with no hemichannels
present (white arrows) were also observed indicating that some liposomes
do not contain hemichannels. (F) Image showing the presence of hemichannels
of different heights in the same bilayer. (G) Enlarged images of the
channels highlighted in F (scale bar is 2 nm). (H) Cross-sections
of the membrane showing the height of the membrane along the lines
in F.

Not all of the liposomes appeared
to contain hemichannels. Some
samples showed flat areas where no obvious protrusions were present
(Figure 6E). This indicates that the liposomes
were not completely saturated with protein. The hemichannels reconstituted
into DOPC bilayers displayed two distinct populations of hemichannels
based on the protrusion heights (Figure 6F–H).
The measured hemichannel heights were fit to multiple Gaussians (Figure 7). The heights of the populations based on these
fits were measured to be in two groups of 0.9 ± 0.3 nm and 2.3
± 0.3 nm (n = 58), respectively. Small variations
between the heights are most likely due to the influence of the imaging
force. The protrusion height of the hemichannels imaged with AFM was
statistically significantly greater for the reconstituted hemichannels
compared to those imaged in the membranes (p &lt;
0.01) (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Histograms of protrusion
heights of Cx26 hemichannels in purified
membrane fragments compared to populations of reconstituted hemichannels.
The mean protrusion height of hemichannels in the purified membranes
(blue) was lower than for hemichannels reconstituted in DOPC liposomes
(red). A Gaussian fit was applied to the two populations of heights
observed for reconstituted hemichannels (green line). The protrusion
heights were measured as 0.9 ± 0.3 nm and 2.3 ± 0.3 nm reconstituted
hemichannels and 0.4 ± 0.2 nm for hemichannels in purified membrane
fragments.

Discussion
We
report for the first time AFM imaging of noncrystalline Cx26
hemichannels in purified membranes expressed through baculovirus infection
of insect cells. Preparations of native single (undocked) hemichannel
layers isolated from mammalian cells have not been documented, most
likely because they are too dispersed in the plasma membrane and do
not survive the detergent enrichment. Most reports of single hemichannel
layers were from mechanically or chemically split GJs. In addition,
the trafficking of GJ channels in native mammalian systems is highly
regulated32 with the caveat that cells
maintain only a small number of open hemichannels and subsets of open
GJ channels.33

Our Sf9 membrane preparations
have the advantage of cellular trafficking
of hemichannels to the membrane along with guided insertion of hemichannels
into the membrane. Consequently, the hemichannels in a single membrane
fragment face the same direction in the membrane bilayer (cytoplasmic
or extracellular) compared to a random orientation when hemichannels
are reconstituted into liposomes. AFM images of purified membrane
fragments containing Cx26 hemichannels have patches where the lipid
bilayers were thicker. This is likely due to the clustering of hemichannels
in the membranes into protein-rich regions. GJ channels are well characterized
to form clusters that favor improved interaction energy between cell
membranes.34 In the Owicki model of GJ
channel clustering, long-range protein aggregation into GJ plaques
arises from interparticle interactions as well as lateral pressures
between the junction and the surrounding glycocalyx.35,36 Whether dense hemichannel packing occurs in internal membrane compartments
(ER, Golgi apparatus, trafficking vesicles) has yet to be determined.
Normal trafficking of hemichannels occurs through anterograde pathways
after which they are fused into the plasma membrane and then coalesce
on the edges of GJ plaques where they dock and form GJ plaques.37,38 Cx26 hemichannels in our present work appear to display aggregating
behavior in some of the membranes as the proteins did not appear to
be spread homogeneously throughout the membrane. Clustering of ion
channels and receptors in single cell plasma membrane is not unusual,
and they serve as important communication links between the cells
and their surroundings.39 Large lipidic
patches of membrane could be observed (Figures 2, 3) next to the protein-rich regions. The
step height between the protein-rich and lipidic membrane regions
was 1.8 ± 0.4 nm. This step height is similar to protrusion heights
for Cx26 GJ channels measured with EM, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray
crystallography. Measurements of protrusion heights obtained from
the X-ray crystallographic atomic model were 1.9 nm for the cytoplasmic
domains and 2.3 nm for the extracellular domain.14 It is important to note that this is probably an estimate
since these GJ channels were not membrane embedded as well as the
protrusion height measurement represented one-half the distance measured
for the docked dodecameric GJ channel.

High resolution images
of the cytoplasmic domains of the hemichannel
were likely to be reduced slightly by the presence of the His6 and V5 tags on the Cx26 connexins. The presence of terminal
tags would increase the floppiness of cytoplasmic side of the hemichannels
and could possibly inhibit imaging slightly. The protrusion heights
of the hemichannels measured in purified membrane fragments were lower
than those previously reported for crystal and quasi-crystalline structures.
The heights were likely reduced due to the high density and disorder
of the surrounding proteins reducing the true height of the channel
compared to its surrounding. The protrusion height of hemichannels
in DOPC bilayers was observed to be greater than those found in the
membranes with 0.4 ± 0.2 nm for the hemichannels in purified
membrane fragments and 0.9 ± 0.3 nm and 2.3 ± 0.3 nm for
the two populations of channels observed in reconstituted DOPC membranes.
The greater protrusion height observed for the reconstituted proteins
is likely a result of the AFM probe being able to access the membrane
more easily due to lower hemichannel densities.

The protrusion
height of the reconstituted hemichannels showed
distinct populations likely due to differences in the cytoplasmic
and extracellular structures. The measured protrusion height above
the bilayer for the reconstituted channels measured by AFM was 0.9
± 0.3 nm and 2.3 ± 0.3 nm. Fiber diffraction analysis of
pellets containing partially oriented GJs revealed that the extracellular
gap between two membranes with GJ channels was ∼3.5 nm thick,
which would estimate extracellular protrusions of ∼1.8 nm.15 Similar sizes were observed in density maps
of Cx26 GJ channels reconstituted into DOPC membranes with extracellular
gaps of ∼4 nm for reconstituted Cx26 in a DOPC membrane (∼2
nm per an extracellular protrusion).29,40 Measurements
of the cytoplasmic tails have been more elusive due to the flexibility
of the cytoplasmic tails. In the best structurally preserved part
of the three layer structure, the cytoplasmic protrusion heights measured
in these EM density maps were ∼2–2.5 nm for Cx26 containing
a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site of 6 amino acids,
but without a 14 amino acid V5 epitope tag.29 In addition, this structure was determined at 4 °C temperature,
so the assumption is that it would be more rigid under these conditions
than in our room temperature AFM imaging chamber. It should also be
noted that the X-ray crystallographic data were recorded from crystals
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. We found that, as measured with AFM,
the cytoplasmic face of Cx26 hemichannels is highly sensitive to the
applied force with decreases in the observed protrusion height from
1.7 nm at 50 pN of force to 0.2 nm at 70 pN in quasi-crystalline packing.18 Dispersed hemichannel proteins should have increased
flexibility allowing the proteins to flatten more easily due to the
lack of a lattice structure. The intrinsically high flexibility of
the cytoplasmic surfaces and hemichannel dispersion likely accounts
for the population height observed for reconstituted hemichannel proteins.
The hemichannels with lower protrusions of 0.9 ± 0.3 nm are most
likely cytoplasmic while the larger protrusion heights (2.3 ±
0.3 nm) are the extracellular domains, which are more rigid.

We report high resolution AFM imaging of noncrystalline disordered
Cx26 hemichannels expressed in membranes for the first time. Previous
studies on the structure of hemichannels with AFM have revealed high
resolution structures of hemichannels. Images of hemichannels that
had been force dissected with AFM have revealed in great detail the
structure of extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of hemichannels
in quasi-crystalline structures.18 However,
these docked hemichannel systems vary from native hemichannel presentations,
which involve formation of disordered hemichannel arrays in the plasma
membrane and subsequently aggregate into GJ edges in order to dock.41 Structures of disordered noncrystalline hemichannels
have also been studied in reductionist systems involving reconstituted
proteins in lipid bilayers.20,21 These systems fail
to represent the complex environments seen in cellular systems where
the proteins are trafficked to a plasma membrane, which contains diverse
lipid compositions and other membrane proteins, before the hemichannels
freely diffuse to the edge of a GJ.37,38 The system
presented in this paper for AFM imaging allows study of connexin hemichannels
in a more complex membrane environment that includes mixed lipid composition
and other membrane proteins, which more closely mimics the environment
of native cells. The behavior of the Cx26 hemichannels in the purified
membrane environment differs from proteoliposomal systems through
increased density of channels and apparent aggregation of proteins
in the membranes. In addition to showing clustering of properly trafficked
connexin hemichannels, this system presents unique opportunities to
study the structure of hemichannel proteins and their cooperative
behavior using electrophysiological and high resolution imaging with
AFM.
