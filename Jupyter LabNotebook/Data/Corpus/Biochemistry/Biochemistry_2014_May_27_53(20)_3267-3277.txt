It has been
shown that semen
gelation and liquefaction following ejaculation are important processes
in mammalian reproduction.− Immediately following ejaculation,
semen becomes highly viscous and forms a semisolid gelatinous mass
called the semen coagulum., The dense network of
fibrous proteins that comprise the coagulum temporarily entraps and
immobilizes spermatozoa allowing various chemical processes to occur,
and providing the female reproductive tract sufficient time to prepare
for fertilization.− The semenogelin proteins (SEM1 and SEM2), originating
from the seminal vesicles, are the primary components of the semen
coagulum and play a role in reducing spermatozoon motility.− Subsequent semen liquefaction is dependent on prostate specific
antigen (PSA), a protease that degrades the fibrous coagulum structure., Liquefaction occurs approximately 20 min following ejaculation and
results in increased spermatozoon motility.,

Interestingly, recent work indicates that PSA-generated peptide
fragments of the semenogelin proteins form amyloid fibrils in semen., Amyloid fibrils are protein aggregates that have fibrillar morphology
and extensive β-sheet structure and are generally formed by
hydrophobic residues found in the fibrillar core., Although
amyloid fibrils are typically involved in neurodegenerative diseases,, SEM fibrils have been shown to enhance infection by both HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus) and CMV (cytomegalovirus).,, This property of the SEM fibrils makes them
similar to the previously identified, cationic SEVI (semen-derived
enhancer of viral infectivity) amyloid fibrils, which promote HIV
infection by facilitating the attachment of HIV-1 virions to cellular
targets.− Because sexual transmission accounts for approximately
80% of new HIV infections, and semen markedly
enhances HIV infection rates in vitro,,−,− semen-derived amyloid fibrils that increase HIV infectivity may
be targets for therapeutic development.

Of the many peptide
fragments of SEM1 and SEM2 generated during
PSA cleavage, the peptide fragment of SEM1 corresponding to residues
86–107 [SEM1(86–107)] is a highly prevalent peptide
fragment found in fresh semen. SEM1(86–107),
a cationic peptide with a pI of ∼10, forms amyloid fibrils
that enhance HIV infection. Endogenous
amyloids in semen are composed of this peptide, suggesting that fibrillar SEM1(86–107) is present
in regular, unmanipulated semen. The levels of SEM1(86–107)
in semen directly correlate with donor-dependent variations in HIV-enhancing
activity, and semen lacking SEM fibrils does not enhance HIV-1 infection., As such, strategies aimed at disrupting the structure of SEM1(86–107)
may limit semen-mediated transmission of HIV. To date, no studies
have examined the detailed structural properties of SEM1(86–107)
or SEM fibrils or the molecular forces stabilizing these structures.
This work focuses on understanding the conditions that drive SEM1(86–107)
fibril formation and dissociation and dissects how the residues of
SEM1(86–107) are arranged in the context of SEM1(86–107)
fibrils. In particular, the SEM1(86–107) fibril structure was
determined via hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
(HDXMS) and hydroxyl radical-mediated protein modification and used
to understand what interactions drive the formation and maintain the
stability of these HIV infectivity-enhancing amyloid fibrils. Knowing
which residues are exposed in the SEM1(86–107) fibril structure
(i.e., residues with exposed side chains not involved in backbone
hydrogen bonding) will reveal which residues likely interact with
HIV or the cell surface, a prerequisite for fibril-mediated enhancement
of HIV infectivity. Conversely, knowing which residues comprise the
SEM1(86–107) fibril core will allow for the design of specific
inhibitors of SEM1(86–107) fibril formation or compounds that
cause fibril disaggregation.

Experimental Procedures
Buffers
All buffers
were prepared using Milli-Q water
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) and filtered through a 0.45 μm pore
nitrocellulose membrane prior to use. PBS (phosphate-buffered saline)
pH 7.7, PBS pH 5.5, ABS (acetate-buffered saline) pH 5.5, PBS pH 2.5,
and 20 mM NaPB (sodium phosphate buffer) pH 7.7 were prepared as described
previously.

Peptide Synthesis and Concentration
Measurement
SEM1(86–107)
is a 22-residue peptide corresponding to residues 86–107 of
the human semenogelin 1 protein (Figure A).
SEM1(86–107) was purchased from Celtek Peptides (Franklin,
TN) at 98% purity. To remove residual acid present in the lyophilized
sample after purification, the peptide was subjected to three rounds
of lyophilization and resuspension in Milli-Q water. The molecular
mass of SEM1(86–107), as determined by ExPASy’s proteomics
server, is 2445.3 Da.

and pH dependence of fibril formation.
(A) SEM1(86–107) peptide sequence. Acidic residues are colored
red, basic residues blue, and His residues purple. (B) SEM1(86–107)
fibril formation was assessed by ThT fluorescence following incubation
for 24 h in PBS pH 7.7 (black line) or PBS 2.5 (red line). (C) Far-UV
CD spectra were measured prior to (blue line) and following (black
and red lines) SEM1(86–107) fibril formation at pH 7.7 (blue
and black lines) and 2.5 (red line). (D and E) SEM1(86–107)
fibril formation was also assessed by AFM imaging after incubation
for 24 h in PBS pH 7.7 (D) or PBS 2.5 (E). Scale bars in panels D
and E correspond to 500 nm.

Because SEM1(86–107) does not contain any aromatic
residues,
the concentration was determined using the absorbance at 205 nm. Concentration measurements were performed in
0.1 M K2SO4 and 5 mM KH2PO4 adjusted to pH 7.0 with potassium hydroxide. SEM1(86–107)
was diluted into the measurement buffer such that the absorbance at
205 nm was between 0.3 and 0.8 (∼1000-fold dilution for 12
mg/mL peptide). An extinction coefficient (ε205)
of 27.0 mL mg–1 cm–1 was calculated
according to the method reported by Scopes.

Fibril Preparation
SEM1(86–107) fibrils were
prepared by the dissolving dry SEM1(86–107) peptide in 3.5
mM HCl pH 2.5 and adjusting the concentration to 7.5 mg/mL (3.066
mM). This stock solution was diluted 3-fold in a dilution buffer [one
part 7.5 mg/mL SEM1(86–107) stock solution to two parts dilution
buffer] to yield 2.5 mg/mL (1.022 mM) SEM1(86–107) in PBS pH
7.7 or 2.5 as reported previously. The
samples were prepared on ice, and fibril formation was facilitated
by agitating the samples at 37 °C for 24 h in a New Brunswick
(Edison, NJ) gyratory water bath shaker (G76) at ∼180 rpm.

Thioflavin T Fluorescence Assays
Thioflavin T (ThT)
fluorescence assays were used to confirm SEM1(86–107) fibrillation.
Aliquots of SEM1(86–107) were withdrawn from incubation samples
(2.5 mg/mL, 1.022 mM) and diluted to 0.11 mg/mL (46.5 μM) in
PBS pH 7.7 containing a final concentration of 5.45 μM ThT [25
μL of 2.5 mg/mL SEM1(86–107) was mixed with 30 μL
of 100 μM ThT in NaPB pH 7.7 and 495 μL of PBS pH 7.7].
Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer
(Horiba Jobin Yvon, Kyoto, Japan). The samples were excited at 440
nm, and emission was collected at 482 nm for 90 s and averaged. Additionally,
emission spectra were collected between 450 and 550 nm. The ThT fluorescence
emission intensities were corrected for fluctuations in lamp intensity
by dividing the fluorescence signal by the lamp intensity. The reported
ThT fluorescence values and errors are the averages and standard deviations
of at least three independent experiments.

Atomic Force Microscopy
Imaging
Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) imaging was used to probe the morphology of SEM1(86–107).
A volume of 15–25 μL of a SEM1(86–107) peptide
solution was incubated for 20 min on freshly cleaved mica. The mica
was subsequently washed three or four times with 1 mL of Milli-Q water
and allowed to dry overnight. The mica surface was imaged in air at
room temperature and humidity in AC tapping mode on a MFP-3D atomic
force microscope (Asylum Research, Santa Barbara, CA) using a silicon,
Al reflex coated cantilever with a tip radius of 9 nm, a resonant
frequency of 70 kHz, and a spring constant of 2 N/m (AC240TS, Olympus
America Inc., Center Valley, PA). Images were analyzed using Igor
Pro MFP3D (Wavemetrics Inc., Portland, OR), and AFM amplitude images
are reported.

Far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
SEM1(86–107)
secondary structure was assessed at pH 7.7 before and after fibril
formation using far-UV circular dichroism (CD). For the SEM1(86–107)
monomer samples, lyophilized SEM1(86–107) was dissolved in
20 mM NaPB pH 7.7 or NaPB pH 2.5 at 0.25 mg/mL. For the SEM1(86–07)
fibril samples, the 2.5 mg/mL peptide was incubated in PBS pH 7.7
for 24 h at 37 °C with agitation to induce fibril formation.
The SEM1(86–107) fibrils in PBS pH 7.7 (12 μL) were separated
from the supernatant via centrifugation at 14000 rpm (20200g) and room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and
the aggregated species were resuspended in 300 μL of 20 mM NaPB
pH 7.7, a buffer in which the SEM1(86–107) fibrils are stable
(Figure ). Far-UV CD spectra were recorded
on a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter at room temperature in a 1 mm quartz
cuvette. The ellipticity of the peptide solution (θ) was corrected
by subtracting the buffer baseline and converted to molar ellipticity
[Θ] using the following equation:where M is the peptide molecular
mass, l is the light path length in centimeters,
and c is the peptide concentration in milligrams
per milliliter.

pH dependence of SEM1(86–107) fibril dissociation.
Preformed
SEM1(86–107) fibrils were resuspended in the indicated buffers.
After 24 h, the presence of fibrils was assessed by relative ThT emission
at 482 nm (A) and AFM imaging (B–F). Scale bars in panels B–F
correspond to 500 nm.

SEM1(86–107) Fibril Dissociation Assay
SEM1(86–107)
fibrils (2.5 mg/mL) were centrifuged at 14000 rpm (20200g) at room temperature, and the supernatant was removed. The fibril
pellet was resuspended in PBS pH 7.7, 20 mM NaPB pH 7.7, PBS pH 5.5,
ABS pH 5.5, or PBS pH 2.5 for 24 h at room temperature. After resuspension
for 24 h, AFM images were taken and ThT fluorescence emission intensity
was measured.

Hydrogen–Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry
Sample
Preparation
Hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) was
assayed in the exchanged monomer, exchanged fibril, in-exchange monomer,
and unexchanged monomer samples to determine which residues constitute
the SEM1(86–107) fibrillar core. The exchanged monomer sample
reflects the maximal amount of deuterium incorporation and controls
for back-exchange (deuterium loss after quenching). The exchanged
fibril sample is used to probe the protection of amide hydrogens in
the fibril, and the in-exchange monomer is used to measure the amount
of deuterium incorporation that occurs after quenching. SEM1(86–107)
fibrils (2.5 mg/mL) prepared in PBS pH 7.7 were pelleted by centrifugation
at 14000 rpm (20200g) for 20 min at 4 °C. The
supernatant was removed, and the pellet containing the fibrils was
resuspended in 20 mM NaPB pH 7.7, 98% D2O, and 2% H2O. In parallel, the exchanged monomer sample was prepared
by dissolving the lyophilized peptide monomer in the same buffer to
a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. Both the fibril and monomer samples
were allowed to exchange for 1 h at 25 °C. These HDX conditions
were chosen because monomers do not form fibrils within this incubation
period and the fibrils are stable under these conditions (Figure ). In addition, D2O exposure for 1 h is sufficient
to fully exchange the monomer because longer exchange times do not
lead to more deuterium incorporation and direct injection of this
sample into the mass spectrometer confirmed that this sample had nearly
100% deuterium incorporation prior to proteolytic cleavage and chromatography
separation. This result suggests that the freshly dissolved peptide
is monomeric because, to observe 100% HDX, all amide hydrogens must
be accessible, which would not be the case if oligomerization occurred.
Following exchange, the samples were quenched and the fibrils were
dissociated by placing the samples on ice and diluting them 10-fold
in 20 mM NaPB pH 2.3 (100% H2O). This dilution generates
a 0.25 mg/mL peptide solution in 20 mM NaPB pH 2.5 (9.8% D2O). These quenching conditions were chosen because HDX is reduced
at low temperatures,, and a pH of 2.5 minimizes the
hydrogen–deuterium exchange rate, and leads
to dissociation of SEM1(86–107) fibrils (Figure ). Similarly, the in-exchange monomer samples were prepared
by dissolving the dry SEM1(86–107) peptide at 0.25 mg/mL in
ice-cold 20 mM NaPB pH 2.5 and 9.8% D2O (the quenching
conditions). In addition, 0.25 mg/mL SEM1(86–107) monomer was
dissolved in H2O-based 20 mM NaPB pH 2.5 to produce unexchanged
monomer samples. Following quenching, a nonspecific fungal protease
type XIII from Aspergillus saitoi was added, and
the samples were analyzed by electrospray ionization liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (ESI-LC–MS) on the Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap
XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). For further details
regarding proteolytic cleavage and liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis, see the .

Hydrogen–Deuterium
Exchange Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis
Following elution
and detection, peptide fragments in the unexchanged
monomer control samples were identified by SEQUEST in the Proteome
Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) or manually with
ExPASy’s FindPept tool and used
as input for ExMS. Mass peak centroids
for the exchanged monomer and fibril, and in-exchange control samples,
were identified by ExMS or calculated from peaks identified during
manual inspection of the data.

The mass peaks identified by
ExMS were used as input for HDsite,, a program
that attains close to amino acid resolution by deconvoluting the shape
of each isotopic peak to extract the percent HDX for each residue.
The percent exchange was calculated for each individual sample (exchanged
monomer, exchanged fibril, and in-exchange monomer), using no back-exchange
correction. This analysis demonstrated that the percent HDX of the
exchanged monomer is larger than the percent HDX of the exchanged
fibril and that the percent HDX of the in-exchange monomer is negligible.
Because the percent HDX in the in-exchange monomer was negligible
and HDSite does not correct for in-exchange, no in-exchange correction
was used in this analysis. However, the exchanged monomer samples
were used to correct for back-exchange during calculation of the fibril
HDX in the HDSite program because HDSite can correct for back-exchange.
HDsite does not calculate the HDX for the first two residues in the
sequence because it assumes that these residues completely back-exchange
during the liquid chromatography separation step. Peptide sequences used in the HDsite calculations are shown
in Figure S1A of the . All reported results are the average of five independent experiments
with the error calculated as the standard deviation of the mean.

Hydroxyl Radical-Mediated Modification Mass Spectrometry Sample
Preparation
Hydroxyl radical-mediated modification of the
SEM1(86–107) peptide was monitored using ESI-LC–MS to
determine which residues constitute the SEM1(86–107) fibrillar
core. A volume of 10 μL of SEM1(86–107) fibrils (2.5
mg/mL) in PBS pH 7.7 was centrifuged at 14000 rpm (20200g) for 20 min at 20 °C, and the supernatant was removed. The
pelleted fibrils or 0.025 mg of dry SEM1(86–107) monomer was
dissolved in 100 μL of 20 mM NaPB pH 7.7 containing either 0,
0.0005, 0.005, 0.05, or 0.1% hydrogen peroxide (final peptide concentration
of 0.25 mg/mL). These modification conditions were chosen because
SEM1(86–107) fibrils are stable under these buffer conditions
(Figure ) and the SEM1(86–107) monomer
does not form fibrils over the duration of the experiment. Furthermore,
phosphate buffer does not interfere with hydroxyl radical-mediated
protein modification, making it suitable for this analysis. The samples were placed in a 1 mm quartz cuvette
and exposed for 2 s to a 3 mJ, 266 nm, Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium
aluminum garnet) laser, courteously set up by V. Ermolenkov in I.
Lednev’s laboratory at the University at Albany, The State
University of New York (Albany, NY). Exposure of hydrogen peroxide
to ultraviolet light produces hydroxyl radical species that react
with the peptide’s amino acid residue side chains.− Although hydroxyl radicals can also cleave the peptide backbone
or lead to peptide cross-linking, modification of the residue side
chains is more favorable and little to no backbone cleavage or cross-linking
occurs under these conditions because of the limited production of
free radicals. The peptide concentrations
in the unfibrillated and fibrillated samples were the same, ensuring
that the ratio of hydroxyl radical to peptide remains constant at
a given hydrogen peroxide concentration. In addition, the fibrils
remained evenly suspended in the cuvette during UV exposure.

Following UV irradiation, the samples were immediately quenched with
25 μL of 100 mM methionine in 3% formic acid (final concentrations
of 20 mM methionine and 0.6% formic acid), flash-frozen with liquid
nitrogen, and lyophilized to remove residual hydrogen peroxide., Methionine was used to quench the reaction because it is more reactive
to hydroxyl radicals than other amino acids.−,− Formic acid was added to the sample to lower the
pH and dissociate any aggregated species. To confirm that the quenching
conditions were sufficient, 0.025 mg of dry SEM1(86–107) monomer
was dissolved in 100 μL of 0.005 or 0.1% hydrogen peroxide in
20 mM NaPB pH 7.7 mixed with 25 μL of 100 mM methionine in 3%
formic acid. These prequenched samples (hydroxyl radical-mediated
modification was quenched prior to UV exposure) were then exposed
to UV radiation. Following lyophilization, the samples were analyzed
by ESI-LC–MS before and after proteolytic cleavage. For further
details regarding the proteolytic cleavage and LC–MS analysis,
see the .

Hydroxyl
Radical-Mediated Modification Mass Spectrometry Data
Analysis
Mass spectra were collected by the LTQ Orbitrap
XL Xcalibur program and deconvoluted to a single charge state using
Xcalibur Xtract version 2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). For
the uncleaved peptide samples, the elution peak areas of the unmodified
(2445.33 Da) and modified peptides were calculated. The following
mass shifts were considered according to the modifications identified
by Wang and Chance: oxidation (+15.99
Da mass shift; peptide masses of 2461.32, 2477.31, 2493.30, 2509.29,
and 2525.28 Da), carbonyl addition (+13.98 Da mass shift; peptide
mass of 2459.31 Da), histidine ring opening (−23.02, −22.03,
and −10.03 Da mass shifts; peptide masses of 2422.31, 2423.30,
and 2435.30 Da), degaunidation (−43.05 Da mass shift; peptide
mass of 2402.28 Da), and decarboxylation (−30.01 Da mass shift;
peptide mass of 2415.32 Da). The elution peak areas were used in the
following equation to determine the percent modification of each sample:where %HR
is the percentage of hydroxyl radical-modified
peptide, Amod is the elution peak area
of each modified peptide, and Aunmod is
the elution peak area of the unmodified peptide.

Using these
data, the percentage of hydroxyl radical-mediated peptide modification
was determined as a function of hydrogen peroxide concentration (Figure
S2 of the ). Importantly,
the percent modification in the unmodified (0% H2O2) or prequenched samples (quenched prior to UV irradiation)
is lower than in the fibril sample, indicating that little modification
of the peptide occurred prior to H2O2 exposure
or after quenching. Therefore, the 0% H2O2 samples
were chosen for further analysis as controls because the values of
percent modification in both the 0% H2O2 samples
and prequenched controls were close to zero. In addition, the 0.05%
H2O2 samples were chosen for further analysis
because the percent modification as a function of H2O2 concentration is linear from 0 to 0.05% H2O2, indicating that the modifications do not change the reactivity
of the peptide toward hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, there is noticeable protection of the fibril relative
to the monomer at 0.05% H2O2 (Figure S2 of the ). Single and double oxidations
were the most common modifications, while the contribution of other
modifications to the total peptide concentration was relatively small.
Therefore, in the subsequent analysis of proteolytically cleaved samples,
only singly and doubly oxidized peptides were considered.

In
the cleaved peptide samples, unmodified peptide fragments were
identified manually with ExPASy’s FindPept tool and the masses of singly or doubly oxidized
peptide fragments were calculated by adding 15.99 or 31.98 Da to the
monoisotopic masses of the unmodified peptides. Peptide proteolytic fragment peaks were identified in Xcalibur
version 2.0.7, and the elution peak area for each peptide was calculated.
For each peptide fragment, the elution peak areas were used to calculate
the percent modification of each modifiable residue, assuming that
modification is evenly distributed between modifiable residues in
the peptide sequence, according to the following equation:where R is the percent
modification
of each modifiable residue within a given peptide fragment, A1ox is the elution peak area of the peptide
containing one oxidized residue, A2ox is
the elution peak area of the peptide containing two oxidized residues, Aumod is the elution peak area of the unmodified
peptide, and m is the number of modifiable residues
in the peptide fragment. Arg, Cys, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro,
Trp, Tyr, and Val residues were considered to be modifiable. Ala,
Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, Gly, Ser, and Thr residues were not considered
to be modifiable because the rate of reaction of these residues with
hydroxyl radicals is much lower than the rates of other residues or
their primary modification is not oxidation.,

Using these values, the percent exposure of residues in the
fibril
relative to the monomer was calculated for each peptide fragment via
the following equation:where E is the percent exposure
of a given peptide fragment, F is the percent modification
of the modified fibril sample, M is the percent modification
of the modified monomer sample, F0 is
the percent modification in the 0% H2O2 fibril,
and M0 is the percent modification in
the 0% H2O2 monomer.

The percent exposure
calculated for each peptide fragment was used
in an averaging algorithm to determine the average percent exposure
for each residue. Peptide fragments in the 0.05% hydrogen peroxide
monomer containing no modifications were excluded from analysis because
they contain no information about the percent exposure of residues
in the fibril. Furthermore, peptide fragments containing Leu107 were
excluded from analysis because the percent exposures of peptide fragments
ending with Leu107 were extremely variable compared to corresponding
peptide fragments ending with Leu106. Thus, the average percent exposure
for Leu107 is reported as zero with a large error bar because an accurate
modification percentage cannot be assigned. The high variability in
oxidation of Leu107 in the SEM1(86–107) fibrils may be due
to its location at the C-terminus of the peptide. A similar effect
is not observed at the N-terminus of the peptide because hydroxyl
radicals react much slower with Asp than Leu., Using the peptide fragments shown in Figure S1B of the , the average percent exposure
for each residue was calculated using the following equation:where EOHi is the average
percent exposure for residue i in the fibril relative
to the monomer, ni is
the number of peptide fragments
containing residue i, Ej is the percent exposure for peptide fragment j containing residue i (calculated from
eq ), and mj is the number of modifiable residues in peptide fragment j. For details regarding the choice of this averaging algorithm,
see the .

Equation  calculates the exposure of each
residue in a weighted average using the exposure values of the peptide
sequences containing a given residue. Although different residues
in the same peptide can be modified to different extents, this averaging
procedure assumes that modifiable residues within a given peptide
are modified equally.

Modification profiles, calculated from
three independent experiments,
were normalized to the value reported for residue 95, which on average
showed 100% exposure. Error bars reflect the standard deviation between
three normalized, independent experiments.

Results
pH Dependence
of SEM1(86–107) Fibril Formation and Dissociation
To probe the conditions required for SEM1(86–107) fibril
formation and dissociation and determine acceptable buffer conditions
for structural assays, the effect of pH on SEM1(86–107) fibril
formation and dissociation was tested. The SEM1(86–107) peptide
(2.5 mg/mL) was incubated in PBS pH 7.7 or PBS pH 2.5. Prior to incubation
in pH 7.7 buffer, SEM1(86–107) had a far-UV circular dichroism
(CD) spectrum typical of a random coil with a minimum at ∼200 nm (Figure ). Following agitation in PBS pH 7.7 at 37 °C for 24 h to promote
fibril formation,, far-UV CD spectra, ThT fluorescence
spectra, and AFM images were acquired to assess fibril formation.
Consistent with prior reports, SEM1(86–107)
formed typical fibril structures following incubation in PBS pH 7.7.
The far-UV CD spectrum of SEM1(86–107) after agitation in PBS
pH 7.7 exhibits a minimum at ∼220 nm and a maximum at ∼195
nm (Figure ), which indicate β-sheet
secondary structure and are consistent
with amyloid fibril formation. Secondary
structure content analysis of the spectra according to the method
of Yang et al. indicates that the sample
is composed primarily of β-sheets. Although the minimum at ∼220
nm was broad, the far-UV CD spectrum is similar to far-UV CD spectra
obtained for other amyloid fibrils.− Upon excitation at 440 nm, the
ThT emission spectrum in the presence of the SEM1(86–107) peptide
in PBS pH 7.7 exhibited a maximum at ∼482 nm (Figure ), indicative of amyloid fibrils. AFM images confirmed that these samples formed fibrillar
aggregates with a diameter of ∼6 ± 2 nm (Figure ). The lag time for fibril formation in PBS pH 7.7
was between 12 and 24 h. Conversely, when SEM1(86–107) was
incubated in PBS pH 2.5, the far-UV CD spectrum was typical of random
coil, there was little to no ThT fluorescence, and fibrils were not
observed in AFM images (Figure ), suggesting
that SEM1(86–107) does not form fibrils within 24 h at this
pH (Figure ). Overall, these results suggest
that SEM1(86–107) forms fibrils within 24 h in PBS pH 7.7 but
not in PBS pH 2.5.

The pH dependence of SEM1(86–107)
fibril dissociation was also tested. Fibril dissociation was compared
at pH 7.7 and 2.5 to determine acceptable buffer conditions for structural
assays. In addition, fibril dissociation was tested at pH 5.5 to mimic
the pH conditions following mixing of semen (pH ∼7.7) with vaginal fluid, which under normal conditions
has a pH of ∼5.2. Determining
SEM1(86–107) fibril stability at pH 5.5 will provide an assessment
of whether these fibrils would be stable and available for enhancing
HIV infection upon deposition of semen in the vaginal tract. Fibril
dissociation was tested in two buffers, PBS and ABS, both at pH 5.5.
As expected, preformed SEM1(86–107) fibrils resuspended for
24 h in pH 7.7 buffer (in the presence and absence of physiological
salt concentrations) exhibited strong ThT fluorescence signals, and
fibrils were readily detected in AFM images (Figure ). In contrast, preformed SEM1(86–107) fibrils resuspended
in PBS pH 2.5 exhibited almost no ThT fluorescence, and fibrils were
not observed in AFM images, suggesting that fibril dissociation occurs
at this pH (Figure ). The fact that a pH value
of 2.5 completely dissociates SEM1(86–107) fibrils facilitates
structural analyses of these fibrils by HDXMS and hydroxyl radical-mediated
modification. Interestingly, fibrils resuspended in pH 5.5 buffer
appear to undergo only partial dissociation after 24 h because there
was a partial decrease in ThT fluorescence and fibrils were detected
in AFM images (Figure ). These observations
suggest that after treatment for 24 h at pH 5.5, there is a low level
of SEM1(86–107) fibril dissociation, but the majority of the
fibrils are still intact. Notably, the pH dependence of fibril formation
and dissociation for SEM1(86–107) is similar to that of PAPf39
(also called SEVI when in the amyloid form), another semen-derived,
amyloid fibril-forming peptide fragment that increases HIV infectivity. These results indicate that HIV-enhancing semen
fibrils are more stable at neutral pH than acidic pH, but slightly
acidic pH conditions, reflecting the mixing of vaginal fluid with
semen, permit preformed SEM1(86–107) fibrils to maintain a
fibrillar conformation.

The SEM1(86–107) fibril structure
is of interest because
SEM1(86–107) and peptide fragments containing the SEM1(86–107)
sequence form fibrils that enhance HIV infectivity, and the endogenous
levels of these fragments in semen correlate with semen’s HIV-enhancing
activity., Knowledge of the structural characteristics
of the SEM1(86–107) fibrils will improve our understanding
of the molecular interactions that stabilize the SEM1(86–107)
fibrils and render them able to enhance HIV infection. The subsequent
experiments are aimed at identifying the residues that comprise the
fibrillar core (i.e., residues involved in forming the cross-β
structure) using two different approaches: hydrogen–deuterium
mass spectrometry (HDXMS),,,− and hydroxyl radical-mediated labeling.,,,,−

Identification of the SEM1(86–107)
Fibril Core Sequence
by HDXMS
HDXMS was used to determine the residues that comprise
the SEM1(86–107) fibrillar core. These assays make use of the
fact that exposed amide hydrogens exchange with deuterium more readily
than amide hydrogens involved in hydrogen bonds within the fibril
core.,,− Using this methodology, the fibril core sequence was determined
by measuring the HDX in three samples: the exchanged monomer, exchanged
fibrils, and in-exchange monomer as an additional negative control
(see  for details).
As expected, the masses of peptides in the exchanged monomer sample
were greater than the masses of the same peptides in the exchanged
fibril sample, indicating that sequences within the fibril are protected
from HDX, relative to the monomer (Figure S3 of the ). Importantly, there is negligible
deuterium incorporation in the in-exchange peptide fragments, indicating
that there is limited deuterium incorporation after quenching (Figure
S3 of the ).

The extent of HDX in each sample was used to calculate the HDX profile
for the fibrils., The results of this analysis
indicate that residues 86–92, 96–98, 100, and 104–107
of the SEM1(86–107) peptide are protected from HDX (approximately
&lt;20% HDX) and suggest that these residues are part of the SEM1(86–107)
fibrillar core (Figure ). Residues 93–95,
99, and 101–103 are less protected from HDX (approximately
&gt;40% HDX) and are therefore most likely not involved in the β-sheet
SEM1(86–107) fibril core structure (Figure ). It should be noted, however, that the HDX of His99 is quite
variable (large error bar), and as such, this residue may be protected,
in which case residues 96–100 would all be part of the fibrillar
core.

fibrils calculated using HDSite. Residues
colored red are exposed, while residues colored blue are protected
and predicted to be part of the fibril core. The percent HDX values
of residues colored gray were not determined by this method. Error
bars are the standard deviations of five independent experiments.

Identification of the SEM1(86–107)
Fibril Core Sequence
by Hydroxyl Radical-Mediated Modification
Similar to HDX,
hydroxyl radical-mediated modification assays can probe which residues
are exposed in the amyloid fibrils and be used to determine which
residues comprise the fibrillar core. Unlike the HDX assays, however,
hydroxyl radical-mediated modification probes exposure of amino acid
side chains rather than backbone amide hydrogens. In these assays,
the SEM1(86–107) monomers and fibrils were exposed to a 266
nm laser in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to induce hydroxyl radical-mediated
modification. Analysis of the peptide samples revealed that the fibrils
were protected from hydroxyl radical-mediated modification (∼0.6%
modification at 0.05% H2O2) relative to the
monomer (∼5% modification at 0.05% H2O2). These findings, together with the observation that minimal hydroxyl
radical-mediated modification occurred following quenching (Figure
S2 of the ), suggest
that hydroxyl radical-mediated modification can be used to map the
core residues of the SEM1(86–107) fibrils.

The percent
modification of each residue following hydroxyl radical-mediated modification
was determined by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide and LC–MS
analysis. The results of the analysis revealing exposed residues in
the fibril relative to the monomer are shown in Figure . The percent exposure of some residues was not determined
(gray residues with no bar in Figure ) because
these residues are not readily modified by hydroxyl radicals (see  for more details). As seen
in the HDX assays, residues Leu87, Leu90, His91, Arg98, Leu100, and
Leu106 are protected from hydroxyl radical-mediated modification in
the fibril (&lt;60% modification), suggesting that they are part of
the fibrillar core. Also consistent with the HDX results was the observation
that Lys95 (∼100% modification) is exposed in the fibril, suggesting
it is not part of the fibrillar core. Conversely, Lys92 is exposed
as assessed by hydroxyl radical-mediated modification (∼80%
modification) but protected as assessed by HDX. In addition, His99
is protected as assessed by hydroxyl radical-mediated modification
(∼20% modification) yet not involved in the β-sheet fibril
core structure as assessed by HDX. The discrepancy in the exposure
of Lys92 and His99 may occur because HDX and hydroxyl radical-mediated
modification probe the exposure of residues differently: HDX probes
backbone amide hydrogen protection, while hydroxyl radical-mediated
modification probes amino acid residue side chain exposure. In addition,
Lys92 and His99 are on the edges of the fibrillar core as defined
by HDXMS (and confirmed by hydroxyl radical-mediated modification),
making disagreement between the two methods more likely for these
residues. The discrepancy between the results for His99 may also be
explained by the fact that the standard deviation was quite large
in the HDX assay, which suggests that this residue is most likely
protected.

SEM1(86–107) fibril core sequence determined by hydroxyl
radical-mediated modification. Vertical bars represent the percent
exposure of residues in the SEM1(86–107) fibrils as calculated
by eq . Residues colored red are exposed, while
residues colored blue are protected and predicted to be part of the
fibril core. The percent exposure values of residues colored gray
were not determined by this method. Error bars reflect the standard
deviations of three independent experiments.

Importantly, there is overall agreement between the HDX and
hydroxyl
radical-mediated modification results (Figure ). To compare the percent HDX and hydroxyl radical-mediated modification
of the SEM1(86–107) fibrils, the profiles were rescaled (normalized)
between zero and one according to the smallest and largest percent
exposure values. As shown in Figure , there
is a qualitative linear correlation between the percent HDX and hydroxyl
radical-mediated modification for residues 90–92. Similarly,
the exposures of residues 95–106 also have a qualitative linear
correlation between the two measurement methods. Qualitative rather
than quantitative agreement between HDX and hydroxyl radical-mediated
modification is expected because of the limited number of residues
that can be analyzed by hydroxyl radical-mediated modification and
the fact that the two assays probe completely different parameters
(backbone amide hydrogen vs amino acid side chain exposure). Therefore,
the presence of such a trend strongly suggests that the identified
core sequences are valid. In particular, both methods show that residues
86–91, 96–100, and 104–107 of the SEM1(86–107)
peptide are protected, suggesting that these sequences are part of
the fibrillar core. In agreement with experimental assays, sequence-based
computational prediction− of amyloidogenic residues in SEM1(86–107) suggests a similar
pattern in which residues 86–91 and 102–107 are predicted
to be amyloidogenic (Figure S4 of the ).

Lines in panel A are shown to guide the eye. Black bars in panel B
are the values calculated from HDXMS experiments, and gray bars are

assays. Residues colored red are exposed, while residues colored blue

of residues lacking bars was indeterminate. Error bars are the standard
deviations of at least three independent experiments.

Discussion
SEM fibrils, in particular
SEM1(86–107), have recently been
identified as amyloid fibrils in semen that markedly enhance HIV-1
infection., These amyloids join SEVI as naturally occurring factors that may play major roles
in propagating the sexual spread of the virus. Consistent with the
notion that semen amyloids play a significant role in the ability
of semen to enhance HIV infection is the fact that the levels of these
amyloidogenic peptides correlate with HIV-enhancing activity, and
that semen deficient in these fibrils lacks the ability to enhance
infection.,, This work
provides the first detailed structural characterization of the SEM1(86–107)
fibrils, via examination of the pH dependence of SEM1(86–107)
fibril formation and dissociation and identification of its amyloid
core region.

Examination of the pH dependence of SEM1(86–107)
fibril
formation and dissociation revealed that, similar to PAPf39 (SEVI),, the SEM1(86–107) peptide forms fibrils at neutral pH but
not at pH 2.5. Furthermore, the fibrils of both peptides are stable
at pH 7.7, partially dissociate at pH 5.5, and fully dissociate at
pH 2.5. Thus, it appears that the pH
dependence of fibril formation and dissociation is a common property
between semen-derived amyloids and may play a role in the biological
function of semen-derived amyloid fibrils. It is worth noting that
the pH of semen is ∼7.7 whereas
the pH of vaginal fluid is ∼5.2. Because semen is buffered, a mixture of semen with vaginal fluids
generates a solution with a pH of 5–6,, a pH at which SEM1(86–107) fibrils undergo only partial dissociation
(Figure ) and, therefore, should be capable
of enhancing HIV infection. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), a common disorder
in which changes in vaginal flora render vaginal fluid less acidic,
is associated with a 60% increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition in women. It is tempting to speculate that mixing of BV
vaginal fluid with semen would lead to more neutral conditions that
favor SEM1(86–107) fibril stability (Figure ), and that this could facilitate HIV transmission by promoting
the activity of semen fibrils.

In addition to the demonstration
of the pH dependence of SEM1(86–107)
fibril stability, the core sequence of SEM1(86–107) was determined
using both hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and
hydroxyl radical-mediated protein modification. These assays showed
that residues 86–91, 96–100, and 104–107 of SEM1(86–107)
are protected from HDX and hydroxyl radical-mediated modification
and are part of the fibrillar core. Conversely, residues 92–95
and 101–103 are less protected from modification and are therefore
likely solvent-exposed. Importantly, these two methods, which apply
very different chemistry, lead to similar conclusions with regard
to exposed versus buried residues in the fibril structure. Using this
structural information, the following SEM1(86–107) fibril structure
is proposed: residues 86–91, 96–100, and 104–107
form β-strands, and residues 92–95 and 101–103
form turn or loop regions. Importantly, fibril structures that contain
three or more β-strand segments have been documented.− For instance, models based on experimental data predict that the
HET-s prion forms triangular fibrils, and α-synuclein,
tau, Ure2p, amylin, and the B1 domain of IgG binding protein G form
superpleated β-sheets.,,− Thus, it is possible that SEM1(86–107) forms
triangular fibrils or superpleated β-sheets. Furthermore, because
short stretches of two to six residues can form β-arcs or tight turns, it is possible that exposed residues 92–95 and 101–103
form turn regions in the fibril structure.

The structural information
obtained by the hydrogen–deuterium
exchange and hydroxyl radical-mediated protein modification assays
also provides potential insight into the pH dependence of SEM1(86–107)
fibril formation and dissociation. Within the SEM1(86–107)
sequence, there are three residues that undergo changes in their ionization
states between pH 7.7 and 2.5: Asp86, His91, and His99. Interestingly,
all of these residues are on the edges of the fibrillar core regions.
Asp86 and His91 flank the 86–91 fibril core region, while His99
is on C-terminal edge of the 96–100 fibril core region. Having
these ionizable residues at the edges of the fibril core sequence
may help regulate the pH dependence of fibril formation and dissociation.
At low pH, the His residues become positively charged while the Asp
residue becomes neutral, causing an increase in the peptide net charge.
Fibril formation may not occur at low pH because the positively charged
His residues disfavor burial within the fibril core, while neutralization
of the N-terminal Asp residue increases the net positive charge at
the N-terminus. A similar mechanism can be used to explain the dissociation
of preformed fibrils at low pH. If the residues are located at the
edge of the aggregated regions, they can disrupt fibril structure
at low pH. Therefore, the location of the ionizable residues relative
to the aggregated regions of the SEM1(86–107) peptide may be
essential for determining their effect on the pH dependence of fibril
formation and dissociation.

Knowing the SEM1(86–107)
fibril core sequence also provides
information about fibril properties that are crucial for SEM1 fibril-mediated
enhancement of HIV and CMV infection., The fact that
residues 92–95 and 101–103 of the SEM1(86–107)
sequence are solvent-exposed in the fibrils reveals interesting insights
into the mechanisms of fibril action. The exposed regions of the peptide
contain three positively charged residues (Lys92, Lys95, and Arg98),
which may facilitate electrostatically mediated binding of virions
to the fibrils. Exposure of positively charged residues is consistent
with the notion that the cationic properties of semen fibrils are
crucial for their ability to enhance viral infection.,, Interestingly, the N-terminal
region of the PAPf39 peptide, which contains the majority of positively
charged residues in the sequence, is exposed on the PAPf39 fibril
(SEVI) surface. The PAPf39 and SEM1(86–107)
peptides have no sequence similarity, suggesting that exposure of
cationic residues in the two fibrils results from different fibril
structures. Thus, exposure of cationic residues may be a general semen
amyloid fibril property, and both PAPf39 and SEM1(86–107) fibrils
may interact with HIV and the cell surface to enhance HIV infection.
At the same time, the data identifying residues 86–91, 96–100,
and 104–107 as the amyloid core of SEM1(86–107) suggest
that peptides or small molecules targeting these regions may disrupt
the SEM1(86–107) fibril structure. Disrupting the fibrillar
state of SEM1(86–107) may potentially be used as a microbicide
strategy to antagonize the activity of these fibrils because the monomeric
states of amyloidogenic SEM peptides lack the ability to enhance HIV
infection., Future studies will aim to target the amyloid
core region of SEM1(86–107) through the design of sequence
specific antagonists and test the effects of these antagonists on
SEM1(86–107) structure and HIV-enhancing activity. Conversely,
rather than disrupting the fibril structure, exposed residues can
be targeted by compounds that inhibit interactions of fibrils with
HIV or the cell surface.
