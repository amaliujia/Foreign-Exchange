In 1996 a heme b containing and chlorite degrading oxidoreductase was discovered
in chlorate- and perchlorate-reducing facultative anaerobic bacteria
(PCRB). The metalloprotein (EC 1.13.11.49)
was found to degrade chlorite to chloride and molecular oxygen, and
the misleading and chemically incorrect name chlorite dismutase (Cld)
was assigned to it. As it was initially
found in PCRBs, it was attributed a role of protecting PCRBs from
accumulation of harmful chlorite. In recent years, homologous proteins
were found in many other bacterial and archaeal phyla. Reconstruction
of the phylogeny of chlorite dismutases as well as elucidation of
X-ray structures revealed the presence of two main clades of active
enzymes as well as similarities in overall fold and heme cavity architecture
with another relatively new family of so-called dye-decolorizing peroxidases.−

X-ray structures are available for representatives of both
phylogenetically
separated main Cld lineages. Three-dimensional structures of Clade
1 comprise homopentameric Clds from Dechloromonas aromatica (PDB codes 3QO8, 3QO9: 3.05
and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively) and “Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii”
(3NN1, 3NN2: 1.85 and 1.94 Å
resolution, respectively) and homohexameric
Cld from Azospira oryzae (2VXH: 2.1 Å), whereas Clade 2 Clds seem to be homodimeric proteins [Cld from Nitrobacter winogradskyi (3QPI: 2.1 Å)]. Besides differences in oligomeric architecture, Clds of Clades
1 and 2 exhibit differences in subunit structure− as well as in conformational and
thermal stability. Despite these disparities
in overall structure and stability, the heme binding cavity provides
an almost identical environment in Clds from both clades.− This is supported by the fact that both the high-spin and low-spin
forms of Clds from CandidatusNitrospira
defluvii (NdCld) and Nitrobacter winogradskyi (NwCld) exhibit similar standard reduction potentials of the Fe(III)/Fe(II)
couple as well as similar chlorite degradation
activity (NdCld: kcat/KM = 6.2 × 105 M–1 s–1; NwCld: kcat/KM = 2.1 × 106 M–1 s–1) .,

The prosthetic
group in chlorite dismutases is heme b, which is
proximally coordinated by a histidine (His160, NdCld numbering)
that is hydrogen-bonded to a glutamate residue (E210). This couple
of amino acids, together with neighboring lysine (K141) and two tryptophan
residues (W145, W146), are found in all structures of functional Clds
solved so far (Figure ).− The most prominent and fully conserved
amino acid residue on the distal side of functional Clds is an arginine
(R173). Its side chain is flexible and is found in diverse conformations
in crystal structures of Clds: either pointing away from the heme b iron toward the putative substrate entrance, or oriented toward the active site., The latter
conformation seems to be stabilized by anionic ligands. Being the only charged residue in the distal
side, R173 was proposed to participate in the chlorite degradation
mechanism. Namely, R173 was suggested to be involved in substrate
binding and reduction as well as in stabilization of the transient
intermediate hypochlorous acid (reaction ).,

The following redox pathway has
been proposed based on a few studies.− The native ferric heme enzyme
is oxidized to a transient intermediate
(compound I) state, which — in analogy to conventional heme
peroxidases — was suggested to be an oxoiron(IV)porphyryl radical
[Por•+Fe(IV)=O] (reaction ). The reaction product hypochlorous
acid must be kept close to the oxoferryl-oxygen since it serves as
two-electron donor, thereby restoring the Fe(III)-state and releasing
chloride and dioxygen (reaction ). In the second
half-reaction, an O–O bond is formed, a reaction so far only
described in the water-splitting manganese complex of photosystem
II of oxygenic phototrophic organisms and in a yet uncharacterized enzyme of an anaerobic methane-oxidizing
bacterium.

Proof of reactions  and  requires the characterization
of the electronic and spectral
properties of the involved (transient) redox states and reaction products,
the kinetics of interconversion and the role(s) of the conserved heme
cavity residues in these reactions. Two Clds have been used for those
studies so far, namely, chlorite dismutases from Dechloromonas
aromatica (DaCld), and NdCld, suggesting a catalytic role for the distal arginine, and the formation of protein radical(s). Notably, DaCld and NdCld show tremendous spectral differences [e.g.,
the Soret maximum at pH 7.0 has been reported to be at 393 nm (DaCld) and 408 nm (NdCld)]. Diverse spectral properties could be related to significant differences
in the conformational and thermal stability of enzymes in solution, since the crystal structures, show
an almost identical heme cavity architecture. Six crystal structures
of NdCld variants were solved successfully [see ref () and this work], whereas
no structures of DaCld mutants are reported.,

In this study we have analyzed the role of residues suggested
to
be important for the catalysis of chlorite degradation (R173, E210,
K141, W145, and W146) (Figures  and ), with special emphasis on the role of conserved
residues on the proximal side and further evaluation of the distal
arginine. The single mutants R173E, R173Q, E210A, K141E, W145F, W145V,
W146Y and the double mutants W145V/W146Y, R173Q/E210A, and R173Q/W146Y
were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli and
thoroughly biochemically characterized. Recombinant production and
first characterization of distal mutants R173A and R173K were reported
previously and are studied more extensively
in this work. In detail, the effect of mutation(s) on the UV–vis
spectra, the redox properties of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, the enzymatic
parameters of chlorite degradation (KM, kcat, and kcat/KM) as well as the kinetics of cyanide
binding were analyzed. Moreover, mutants R173E, W145V, W145F as well
as R173Q/W146Y were structurally characterized using X-ray crystallography.
The structures of these mutants together with already available structures
of wild-type NdCld and the variants R173A and R173K and the obtained biochemical/physical data allow a comprehensive
structure–function analysis of this new enzyme family. The
importance of R173 in the chlorite degradation reaction and formation
of the Cld-cyanide complex is demonstrated and discussed as is the
role of the K141-E210-H160 triad in maintenance of the heme cavity
architecture and redox properties.

Materials and Methods
Site-Directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and
Purification
To obtain plasmids for expressing the NdCld
variants R173A, R173K,
R173E, R173Q, E210A, K141E, W145F, W145V, W146Y mutagenesis was carried
out using PhusionFlash polymerase (Finnzymes) with primers and their
reverse complements listed in . The plasmid encoding the N-terminal
TEV-cleavable Strep-II tagged fusion protein wild-type NdCld (without
the N-terminal signal peptide) was used as template. Cloning of the
wild-type NdCld plasmid was described previously. To obtain plasmids for expressing the double mutated NdCld
proteins R173Q/W146Y and R173Q/E210A, the plasmid of R173Q was used
as a template. Similarly, for the double mutant W145V/W146Y the plasmid
of W146Y was used as template (). Total volume of mutagenesis PCR was 20 μL and a two-step
thermocycle was followed (98 °C for denaturation, 72 °C
for annealing and elongation). Original templates were digested with DpnI (Fermentas) and PCR product was transformed into E. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was extracted
using GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Fermentas), and sequencing was
performed from T7prom and T7term by LGC Genomics to confirm successful
site-directed mutagenesis.

Recombinant wild-type NdCld was expressed
in E. coli Tuner (DE3) cells (Merck/Novagen, Darmstadt,
Germany) and purified via a StrepTrap HP 5 mL (GE Healthcare) column
as it was described previously. All mutants
were expressed and purified using the same protocol as for the wild-type
protein.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing
The
NdCld variants W145V, R173Q/W146Y were concentrated to 10 mg/mL and
stored in buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2% glycerol) and crystallized
in conditions containing high ammonium sulfate and low pH ranges from
3.5 to 4.5 (derived from condition 13 of JCSG+ commercial screen,
Qiagen), which is similar to crystallization conditions of the wild-type
NdCld. For cryoprotection, the crystal
was soaked stepwise in the mother liquor containing increasing concentrations
(10%) of ethylene glycol up to final 50% (v/v). The mutant R173E was
crystallized in 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4, and 40% (v/v) ethylene
glycol (condition 2 from the Cryol+II screen, Emerald Biosciences),
which already served as a cryoprotectant. W145F with and without cyanide
was crystallized in 0.7–0.8 M ammonium citrate dibasic in 100
mM sodium acetate buffers pH 4.4–4.5 and 30% (v/v) ethylene
glycol.

Diffraction data were collected either in-house on a
Bruker Microstar (Bruker AXS Inc.) rotating anode at 1.54 Å wavelength
or at several ESRF beamlines (ID23-1, BM14-U). Integration and scaling
was done with XDS and XSCALE for data
collected at ESRF beamlines, while diffraction data in-house was integrated
and scaled with the software package Proteum2 (Bruker AXS Inc.). Data
collection statistics are summarized in Table .

Phasing, Model Building, Refinement, and Validation of the Structures
All structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program
MOLREP. Chain A from the wild-type NdCld
structure (3NN1) was used as search template.

Model building and refinement steps were performed with PHENIX
suite and COOT. The overall structure quality was judged with the web server MOLPROBITY. Refinement statistics are summarized in Table .

In assessing the data quality and establishing
the resolution cutoff
we relied on novel, recently published criteria based on correlation
coefficient CC1/2. We then
performed a controlled paired-refinement,, where the starting model was refined using the same refinement protocol
against both a full data set and a truncated version (to 2.85–2.95
Å) of the full data set. The resulting two models were then compared
in terms of R values (Rwork, Rfree) to judge which model was better
(). In all cases apart from W145F CN, the paired-refinement showed
superior model quality and lower R factors when high-resolution diffraction
cutoff was used. In case of W145F CN we opted for the high-resolution
cutoff as well, despite slightly higher R-factor
because of good model quality and lower overall B-factors.

Structure
factors and coordinates are deposited in the Protein
Data Bank: R173E (entry code 4M05), W145V (4M08), W145F (4M07), cyanide complex
of W145F (4M06), and R173QW146Y (4M09), respectively.

UV–vis Spectroscopy
Spectra
of wild-type NdCld
and mutants were recorded between 250 and 800 nm with an Agilent 8453
diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard). Protein concentration
varied between 10 and 25 μM in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0
. The enzymes were reduced with 10 mM sodium dithionite from a freshly
prepared stock solution.

Steady-State Kinetics
Chlorite dismutase
mediated degradation
of chlorite was monitored by measuring the release of O2 using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygraph Plus; Hansatech Instruments,
Norfolk, United Kingdom) inserted into a stirred water bath kept at
30 °C. The electrode was equilibrated to 100% O2 saturation
by bubbling O2 to the reaction mixture for at least 10
min and for 0% saturation by bubbling with N2 for at least
15 min to derive an offset and calibration factor. Reactions were
carried out in O2-free 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0,
with 10 μM to 2 mM NaClO2 added from a stock made
in the same buffer. Reactions were started by addition of 20 nM of
wild-type NdCld or 200–400 nM of mutants. With increasing chlorite
concentrations, irreversible inactivation of the enzyme occurred,
as was evident with inspection of individual time traces. Therefore
it was important to use only the initial linear phase for rate computation
of the Michaelis–Menten parameters. Molecular oxygen production
rates (μM O2 s–1) were obtained
from initial linear time traces (&lt;10% substrate consumed) and plotted
against chlorite concentrations.

Transient-State Kinetics
The experiments were carried
out with a stopped-flow apparatus (model SX-18MV, Applied Photophysics)
equipped for both conventional and sequential measurements. The optical
quartz cell with a path length of 10 mm had a volume of 20 μL.
The fastest time for mixing two solutions and recording the first
data point was 1.3 ms. All measurements were performed at 25 °C.
For studies on cyanide binding to ferric wild-type NdCld and the mutants,
the conventional stopped-flow mode was used, and the decrease of the
absorbance at the respective Soret maximum was monitored. In a typical
experiment, one syringe contained 0.5 μM enzyme in 50 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0, and the second syringe contained at least a 5-fold
excess of cyanide in the same buffer; in detail cyanide concentrations
ranged from 2.5 μM to 5000 μM. A minimum of four measurements
were performed for each ligand concentration. The apparent second-order
rate constants, kon, were obtained from
the slope of a plot of kobs versus cyanide
concentration. Routinely, cyanide binding was also monitored by using
the diode array detector (Applied Photophysics), which allowed the
synthesis of artificial sets of time-dependent spectra as well as
spectral analysis of enzyme intermediates.

Spectroelectrochemistry
All experiments were carried
out in a homemade optical transparent thin-layer spectro-electrochemical
(OTTLE) cell.,, The three-electrode configuration consisted of a gold minigrid working
electrode (Buckbee-Mears, Chicago, IL), a homemade Ag/AgCl/KClsat microreference electrode, separated from the working solution
by a Vycor set, and a platinum wire as the counter electrode., The reference electrode was calibrated against a saturated calomel
(Hg2Cl2) electrode before each set of measurements.
All potentials are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE,
+242 mV).

Potentials were applied across the OTTLE cell with
an Amel model 2053 potentiostat/galvanostat. Constant temperature
was maintained by a circulating water bath, and the OTTLE cell temperature
was monitored with a Cu-costan microthermocouple. UV–vis spectra
were recorded using a Varian Cary C50 spectrophotometer. The OTTLE
cell was flushed with Argon gas to establish an oxygen-free environment
in the cell.

Spectroelectrochemical experiments were performed
using 650 μL
samples containing 4–6 μM of wild-type or mutant NdCld
in 150 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, plus 100 mM NaCl, in the presence
of various mediators: methyl viologen, lumiflavine-3-acetate, methylene
blue, phenazine methosulfate, and indigo carmine. The concentration
of each mediator in the cell was 4.6 μM, except for methyl viologen
(230 μM). Nernst plots consisted of at least five points and
were invariably linear with a slope consistent with a one-electron
reduction process (n-values of wild-type and mutant
NdClds varied between between 1.0 and 1.4).

Variable temperature
experiments for NdCld as well as for selected
mutants were carried out using a nonisothermal cell configuration
over a temperature range from 10 to 35 °C. The temperature of the reference electrode and the counter
electrode was kept constant, whereas that of the working electrode
was varied. Parametrization of enthalpic and entropic components was
possible by calculating ΔSrc°′ from the slope
of the plot E°′ versus temperature; ΔHrc°′ could be obtained from the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation, thus
from the slope of the plot E°′/T versus 1/T.,

Results
Recombinant Production and Spectral Characterization
of NdCld
Variants
Native and mutated NdClds were expressed in E. coli. With the exception of the double mutant R173Q/E210A,
the heme occupancy in all variants was higher than 85% meaning that
the purity numbers (Reinheitszahlen) ASoret,max/A280 nm varied between 1.7 and
2.2 ().

Figure  shows the UV–vis
spectra of oxidized (ferric) and reduced (ferrous) states of wild-type
NdCld and all mutants investigated in this work. The spectroscopic
properties of ferric wild-type NdCld are indicative of a dominating
high-spin (HS) heme b10 with a Soret maximum
at 408 nm, Q bands at 535 and 570 nm, and a charge-transfer (CT) band
at 640 nm (Figure  and ). Charge-transfer bands are typical for
high-spin heme proteins and are located within the range 610–650
nm, with five-coordinated (5c) HS being typically ≥640 nm and
six-coordinated (6c) HS around 630 nm.

UV–vis spectra

oxidized (ferric) and reduced (ferrous) states at pH 7.0. (A) UV–vis
spectra of distal side variants including the double mutant R173Q/W146Y.
(B) UV–vis spectra of proximal side variants. Spectra of ferric
proteins are depicted in black, and those of ferrous forms are in
red.

With the exception of the double
mutant R173Q/E210A, the Soret
maxima of all variants were red-shifted (408–414 nm) compared
to the native protein. The distal mutants R173K and R173E as well
as the proximal variants E210A and K141E had their Soret maximum at
414 nm and did not show any absorbance in the CT region, indicating
that the heme group had pronounced low-spin character.

Upon
addition of cyanide to these ferric proteins, the corresponding
low-spin variants were formed having the Soret maxima around 420 nm
(see below), that is, red-shifted by 9–12 nm compared to the
corresponding high-spin state. Concomitantly, the CT absorbance disappeared.
Upon reduction by dithionite, most of the variants showed similar
high-spin ferrous spectra with Soret maxima between 432 and 435 nm
and Q bands at 558–560 and 590 nm (Figure  and ). Spectra
of ferrous R173K, E210A, and the double mutant R173Q/E210A exhibited
blue-shifted Soret maxima at 428, 430, and 424 nm respectively indicating
the presence of ferrous low-spin species.

X-ray structures of NdCld
R173E, W145V, W145F, and R173Q/W146Y
The X-ray structures
of wild-type chlorite dismutase from “Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii” as well as the two
variants R173A and R173K have been published recently. In order to enable a comprehensive analysis of the structural
and functional role of conserved active site residues in Clds the
X-ray structures of additional variants (R173E, W145V, W145F, R173QW146Y)
were determined (Figure ). Data were collected
and crystal structures were refined for R173E, W145V, and R173QW146Y.
In both W145V and R173QW146Y, an imidazole served as the sixth ligand
of the heme b. The mutant W145F was crystallized
without and with cyanide bound to the heme iron.

W145V crystallized
in the hexagonal space group P3221, whereas
W145F, R173E, and R173QW146Y crystallized in the monoclinic space
group C2 (Table ). Each subunit
of wild-type NdCld and its mutants is composed of two topologically
equivalent ferredoxin-like domains, as was described in detail by
Kostan et al. The overall structure of
the subunits of the mutants does not change compared to the wild-type
protein, with r.m.s.d. deviations between equivalent Cα atoms ranging from 0.310 Å for mutant W145F+CN to 0.518 Å
for the R173Q/W146Y double mutant (Figure A).

The five subunits in the wild-type and mutant proteins
are arranged
in a ring-like fashion around a central channel. The active site of
NdCld is located in a cavity of the C-terminal ferredoxin-like domain
with heme b embedded in a defined hydrophobic environment.
On the distal heme side, the only residue able to provide a positive
charge, or to shift toward the active site in the presence of an anionic
ligand, is Arg173. In wild-type NdCld arginine 173 was shown to be
oriented away from the heme iron and points toward the putative substrate
entrance (Figure B). In the structure of the mutant R173K, the lysine side chain points
into the heme cavity and forms a hydrogen bond with a trapped sulfate
anion. Figure C,D depicts the structures of R173Q and R173E with imidazole and
acetate (present in crystallization solution) bound at the distal
site of the heme iron. The side chain of the negatively charged glutamic
residue in R173E is oriented away from the heme iron, similar to what
is observed for R173 in wild-type NdCld. In the mutant protein, the
side chain of L168 shifts toward E173, filling in this way the cavity
occupied in the wild-type NdCld by the guanidinium group of R173 (Figure ).

Figure A depicts
the proximal H-bonding
network of wild-type NdCld including H160-E210-K141. The H-bond between
the proximal histidine and E210 (2.7 Å) keeps the heme ligand
in the imidazolate state. Only small changes were observed when W146
was exchanged by tyrosine except an increase in the bond length between
H160 and the heme iron (Figure B). The proximal
NdCld variants W145V and W145F were designed with the rationale to
probe the role of this fully conserved aromatic residue in redox catalysis.
One of the heme propionate carboxylate groups interacts with the NE1
atom of Trp145 which might indicate the possibility of forming a radical
site at this position during enzyme turnover. Upon its replacement by a smaller valine, a cavity is formed (Figure C), and the neighboring W146 (oriented orthogonally
to W145 in the wild-type Clds) is tilted by about 20° compared
to the wild-type structure. Additionally, the H-bonding network within
the conserved amino acid triad K141, E210, and H160 on the proximal
side is weakened in the absence of W145 (Figure ), with both K141 and E210 forming alternative H-bonds with solvent
molecules. Additionally, in the mutant W145V the H-bond between E210
and H160 appears 0.6 Å longer compared to the wild-type protein
(2.7 Å) (Figure C).

As expected,
upon replacement of the W145 residue by a bulky phenylalanine,
the architecture of the heme cavity is similar to wild-type NdCld,
with one important difference. In the mutant W145F the H-bond between
E210 and H160 is broken (length: 3.2 Å) (Figure D). We did not succeed in obtaining the crystal structures
of NdCld K141E and E210A.

The double mutant R173Q/W146Y was
designed to mimic chlorite dismutase-like
proteins that differ in their active site composition from the canonical
Clds, such as the Cld-like protein from Listeria monocytogenes. In this variant, only minor structural effects were observed (Figure ), for example, a change in the orientation of L168
(as in R173E, see above), while Y146 is found in the same position
as W146 in wild-type NdCld.

Enzymatic Activity of NdCld Mutants with
Chlorite
In
order to probe the effect of exchange of active site residues of “Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii” on the degradation
of chlorite, the release of O2 at pH 7.0 was followed polarographically
(Table ). As long as the substrate concentration
was below 1 mM (in order to avoid Cld inactivation), a typical Michaelis–Menten
behavior was seen, and data could be fitted best with a single rectangular
hyperbola function (). Wild-type NdCld has a catalytic efficiency kcat/KM of 6.2 ×
105 M–1 s–1 and a KM of 69 μM. Exchange of Arg173 decreased
the catalytic efficiency [wild-type (100%) &gt; R173A (5%) &gt; R173Q
(2.9%)
&gt; R173K (2.4%) &gt; R173E (2.3%)] and increased the Michaelis constant
[wild-type (100%) &lt; R173A (130%) &lt; R173Q (188%) &lt; R173E (283%)
&lt; R173K (1301%)]. It was interesting to see that (i) R173E is still
able to degrade ClO2– to some extent
(its kcat is still ∼6.3% of the
wild-type value) and that (ii) substitution of a R173 by another basic
amino acid (lysine) increased the KM by
a factor of 13 (Table ).

From the proximal variants, W146Y exhibited an enzymatic
activity
very similar to the wild-type protein. Tryptophan 146 is not directly
involved in the proximal H-bonding network that stabilizes heme ligation
by H160. By contrast, exchange of the direct H-bonding partner (E210)
of the proximal histidine by alanine leads to a decrease of the catalytic
efficiency by 87% compared to the wild-type protein. The significant
increase in the KM value of the variant
E210A (382 μM) compared to the wild-type enzyme reflects a more
than 5-fold decrease in chlorite binding at the distal heme cavity.
By comparison, the effect of disruption of the hydrogen bond between
lysine 141 and glutamate 210 in the mutant K141E was relatively small
(Table ). The two variants having the fully
conserved proximal tryptophan 145 exchanged (W145F and W145V) exhibit kcat/KM values of
about 20% of the wild-type enzyme.

The effects of mutations
in the three double variants on the enzymatic
activity seemed to be additive. The double mutant R173Q/E210A has
the lowest catalytic efficiency and a turnover number smaller than
1 s–1. The double mutant of NdCld R173Q/W146Y, which
mimics the heme cavity of the chlorite dismutase-like protein from Listeria monocytogenes, still has a catalytic efficiency
of 1.9 × 104 M–1 s–1.

Kinetics of Formation of the Low-Spin Cyanide Complex of Cld
Variants
Cyanide is a low-spin ligand that is often used
to probe the accessibility of the active site of heme proteins. Manipulation
of the (distal) heme cavity architecture is often reflected by changes
in both binding rates as well as in the strength of binding of cyanide
to the ferric heme iron. Figure A shows a
representative spectral conversion when ferric mutant W145F was mixed
with cyanide monitored with the stopped-flow apparatus. The corresponding
time trace followed at 408 nm is depicted in the inset. Cyanide converts
the high-spin (S = 5/2) ferric iron state to the
low-spin (S = 1/2) ferric state, thereby shifting
the Soret maximum from 408 to 420 nm with a clear isosbestic point
at 414 nm. The time traces could be fitted best by a double-exponential
equation [obtaining pseudo-first-order rate constants kobs(1) and kobs(2); Figure A] with kobs(1) being
responsible for more than 90% of the decrease in absorbance and kobs(2) showing no dependence on concentration
of cyanide (Figure B, inset) as was reported
for wild-type NdCld. As a consequence,
the apparent second-order rate (kon) constant
for cyanide binding was calculated from the slope of the linear plot
of kobs(1) versus cyanide concentration
(Figure B). In contrast, cyanide binding to
distal arginine mutants R173Q, R173Q/W146Y, and R173E was monophasic,
and kobs was obtained by single exponential
fits, which is in agreement with cyanide binding studies of R173A
and R173K.

Kinetics of cyanide binding
to ferric high-spin NdCld Trp145Phe
followed by stopped-flow spectroscopy. (A) Spectral changes upon reaction
of 0.5 μM NdCld W145F with 10 μM cyanide measured in the
conventional stopped-flow mode. The first spectrum shows native high-spin
NdCld W145F (Soret band at 408 nm), the second spectrum was recorded
1.3 ms after mixing. Subsequent spectra show the formation of the
low-spin cyanide complex (absorbance maximum 420 nm). Arrows indicate
changes of absorbance with time. Conditions: 50 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.0, and 25 °C. The inset shows a typical time trace at 408
nm with double exponential fit (0.7 μM NdCld W145F and 15 μM
cyanide). Linear dependence of kobs(1) and kobs(2) (inset) from the cyanide
concentration is shown in (B) for NdCld W145F (black), NdCld W145V
(red), NdCld W146Y (green), NdCld W145V/W146Y (blue), as well as in
(C) for NdCld R173E (black), NdCld R173Q (red), and NdCld R173Q/W146Y
(green).

Obtained data suggest that manipulation
of proximal W145 and W146
only slightly affected cyanide binding at the distal side (Table ). By contrast, in both E210A and K141E mutants
cyanide binding was extremely slow, and the dissociation constant
increased by 4 orders of magnitude (Table ). Since in (i) all four variants the H-bond between E210 and H160
is extended or broken, and (ii) cyanide binding of W145F (with broken
H-bond) is similar to wild-type NdCld, these differences in cyanide
complex formation cannot be related with the imidazolate character
of the proximal histidine. It is reasonable to assume that the performed
mutations at E210 and K141 led to significant changes of both the
proximal and distal heme cavity architecture, which is also reflected
by the high low-spin character of these variants that hinders cyanide
binding.

As already previously reported, cyanide
binding to wild-type NdCld and the variants R173A and R173K were monophasic,
and exchange of R173 showed a significantly decreased bimolecular
rate constant as well as increased KD values
[= koff/kon, with koff representing the intercepts
of the linear plots in Figure B,C]. Upon exchanging
the positively charged arginine 173 with the negatively charged glutamate,
cyanide binding is even more impeded, whereas the binding kinetics
of NdCld R173Q and R173Q/W146Y is comparable with R173A and R173K
(Figure C and Table ). In any case, Table  demonstrates that
the impact of exchange of arginine 173 on the catalytic efficiency
of chlorite degradation is significantly smaller than on the binding
of the low-spin ligand cyanide.

Spectroelectrochemical
Analyses
Figure  depicts a representative
family of spectra of ferric wild-type
NdCld (Figure A) and variants R173E (Figure B), R173K (Figure C), and
W145F (Figure D) at different applied potentials
in the OTTLE cell. The pentameric wild-type metalloprotein is directly
reduced to its ferrous form with absorption maxima at 435 and 560
nm with a clear isosbestic point at 420 nm. The calculated reduction
potential for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, determined from the corresponding
Nernst plot (inset to Figure A), was calculated
to be at −0.113 ± 0.001 V at 25 °C and pH 7.0. The slope of the Nernst plot indicates that
a single electron is exchanged.

For wild-type NdCld: λox = 410 nm and λred = 435 nm. For the variants, the corresponding Soret
maxima of the ferric and ferrous states are summarized in Table .

Table  summarizes
the E°′ values obtained for the various
Cld variants. The mutant R173Q exhibited a wild-type-like reduction
potential, whereas exchange of arginine 173 by negatively charged
glutamate shifted the reduction potential by about 120 mV to more
negative values. Additionally, mutation of arginine 173 to small and
uncharged alanine lowered E°′ by 66 mV.
In both R173E and R173A variants, the ferric state has been stabilized
due to deletion of the positively charged guanidinium group. In all
these distal mutant proteins, the maximum of the Soret band of the
ferrous form was at 435 nm and no clear shoulder at 424 nm was observed,
indicating no O2 binding to the ferrous state.

In addition,
for wild-type Cld
and the variants R173K and W145F the enthalpic and entropic contribution
to the reduction reaction has been calculated.

Obtained data are not reliable due
to formation of the Fe–O2 adduct.

ND, not determined.

At first sight, it was surprising
that exchange of arginine 173
by positively charged lysine also shifts the standard reduction potential
to a more negative value compared to wild-type NdCld. However, this
nicely reflects the pronounced low-spin character of this variant
(see ).

The proximal heme
cavity variants W146Y showed a wild-type like
redox behavior suggesting very limiting reorganization of H160 and
E210. The E°′ value of the mutant W145V
was slightly more positive (ΔE°′
= +29 mV) compared to wild-type NdCld. Compared to the reorganization
of the proximal H-bonding pattern observed in the X-ray structure
of W145V (see above), this effect is small. Exchange of tryptophan
145 by valine disrupts the H-bond between the heme propionate and
the NE1 of the mutated tryptophan residue (which should lower E°′, since the negative charge of the propionate
group increases upon the disappearance of the H-bond, in which it
acts as H-bond acceptor). Additionally, this mutation promotes a reorientation
of the side chains of K141 and E210, resulting in a weakening of the
H-bond between H160 and E210 (which should decrease the anionic character
of the proximal His and increase E°′)
as seen in the X-ray structure. Most probably both effects partly
compensate in W145V.

Although the overall X-ray structure of
W145F was wild-type-like,
one significant difference concerns the breaking of the H-bond between
the proximal histidine and E210. This was nicely reflected by the
measured reduction potential for the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple, which
was much more positive (ΔE°′ =
+117 mV) compared to the wild-type enzyme. In the X-ray structure
additionally a limited rearrangement of K141 is seen. Similarly, exchange
of lysine 141 by glutamate increased the reduction potential by 119
mV. The effect cannot be of electrostatic origin, since in this variant
K141 was replaced by a negative residue. More likely also this mutation
has disrupted the interaction between E210 and H160. Thus, weakening
of the H-bonding network within the triad K141-E210-H160 and especially
breaking of the H-bond between E210 and H160 leads to complete loss
of the imidazolate character of H160 and significantly increases the
reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple.

It was not
possible to obtain reliable E°′
values for the E210A as well as the double mutants W145V/W146Y and
R173Q/E210A, since the corresponding ferrous states easily bound dioxygen
thus not allowing exact determination of concentrations of pure ferrous
forms in the equilibria. Interestingly, E°′
of the double mutant R173Q/W146Y of NdCld (−133 mV) is slightly
more negative than E°′ the wild-type
protein and of the corresponding single mutants, indicating that the
effect of the two point mutations on E°′
is not additive. This variant resembles the residues of the heme cavity
of a chlorite dismutase-like protein from Listeria monocytogenes (Table ).

To gain a deeper insight
into the mechanism of E°′ modulation
of wild-type NdCld and the variants R173K
and W145F, the temperature dependence of the reduction potential was
investigated (Figure ). This allows parametrization
of the corresponding enthalpic (ΔH°′rc) and entropic (ΔS°′rc) components of the reduction reaction., Fe(III) reduction enthalpy and entropy for wild-type NdCld and for
its R173K and W145F mutants are invariantly positive (Table ). Therefore, in all proteins
the reduction potential is the result of two opposing contributions:
an enthalpic term, which disfavors Fe(III) reduction, and an entropic
contribution, which instead favors Fe(III) reduction. Thus, the enthalpy
and entropy changes partially compensate. The negative E°′ of native Cld is due to the large enthalpic term (+29
kJ mol–1), which overcomes the smaller, yet relevant,
entropic contribution (+63 J K–1 mol–1). The significant enthalpic stabilization of the ferric enzyme is
consistent with the anionic character conferred to the proximal histidine
by the H-bond network formed with the E210 and K141. Compared to plant
heme peroxidases, this effect seems to be partially offset by mutation-induced
deletion of the hydrogen bond connecting one of the heme propionates
with the ring of the native tryptophan and by the increased hydrophobicity
of heme pocket. The positive reduction
entropy of native Cld is consistent with reduction-induced solvent
reorganization effects in the catalytic site, since the decreased
electrostatic interaction of the metal ion in its reduced form with
the water molecules in the cavity should lead to a decrease in ordering., Further contributions to the positive ΔS°′rc value could arise from a reduction-induced increase of the
flexibility of the side chain of R173.

Reduction thermodynamics
of wild-type NdCld and the variants R173K
and W145F. (A) Temperature dependence of the reduction potential and
(B) E°′/T versus 1/T plots for wild-type NdCld (circles), NdCld R173K (squares)
and NdCld W145F (diamonds). The slope of the plot yields the ΔSrc°′/F (A) and −ΔHrc°′/F (B) values, respectively. Solid lines are least-squares
fits to the data points. All experiments were carried out in 150 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mM NaCl.

The relevant increase in the reduction potential of the Fe(III)/Fe(II)
couple induced by the W145F mutation [ΔE°′
(mutant – wild-type) = +117 mV] has a fully enthalpic origin.
In fact, replacement of the native tryptophan residue with a phenylalanine
significantly reduces ΔHrc°′, but does not modify
ΔSrc°′. This is consistent with the
structural effects of the present mutation, which are limited to the
proximal heme site and cause the breaking of the H-bond between H160
and E210, thereby decreasing the anionic character of the latter.

Surprisingly, replacement of R173 with a lysine deeply alters the
reduction thermodynamics of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple. In fact the E°′ of the R173K mutant does not show any pronounced
temperature dependence (please note in Table  the big errors, which are a consequence of the very small impact
of temperature on E°′). This behavior
again reflects the pronounced low-spin character of the mutant R173K
(see above), which diminishes the reduction induced reorganization
within the heme site.,

Discussion
Chlorite
dismutases constitute a novel heme enzyme family with
a structurally unique active site and peculiar enzymatic properties.
Being first described in perchlorate-respiring bacteria that actually produce chlorite as metabolic intermediate,
it has been found that other bacterial groups such as nitrite-oxidizing
bacteria and cyanobacteria also encode this enzyme, and the chlorite-degrading
activity of Clds from nitrite oxidizers was demonstrated.,− As these organisms are not known PCRB, and it appears
to be rather unlikely that chlorite is the main in vivo substrate of their Clds. This raises the question about the physiological
role of functional Clds in these organisms and the nature of the oxidant
and electron donor that catalyzes reactions  and  in these organisms. In order to address
these challenging questions and identify candidate substrates other
than chlorite, it is important
to first understand the impact of active site residues on the well-established
chlorite degradation activity. This was the aim of this study.

Three papers that report on mutational analyses of Cld functionality
have been published so far using DaCld (chlorite dismutase from perchlorate-respiring Dechloromonas aromatica(,)) and NdCld
(Cld from nitrite-oxidizing “Candidatus Nitrospira
defluvii”) as model proteins. It
was interesting to see that DaCld and NdCld, although having the active
site residues at almost identical positions, exhibit significant differences
in spectral properties and conformational stability.,−, As the conformational
and thermal stability of NdCld is high and its mutants can readily be structurally elucidated by X-ray
diffraction, we focused on the Nitrospira protein as model chlorite dismutase in this work.

In all known functional and highly efficient Clds arginine 173
is fully conserved and represents the only charged amino acid in the
distal heme cavity and a role in the ClO2– degradation activity has been postulated. It has been proposed to bind the anionic oxidant chlorite [pKa (chlorous acid, HClO2) = 1.97] (reaction ) as well
as to keep the proposed anionic intermediate hypochlorite [pKa (hypochlorous acid, HClO) = 7.53] in the reaction sphere. In the presence of
the guanidinium group the anionic conjugate base, that is, hypochlorite,
dominates (reaction ). Conformational flexibility
of R173 as suggested by inspection of the available X-ray structures− would be compatible with this role. It was interesting to see that
despite exchange of R173 by small hydrophobic alanine (R173A), neutral
glutamine (R173Q), positively charged lysine (R173K), and negatively
charged glutamate (R173E) the respective mutants still exhibited chlorite
degradation activity with relatively similar catalytic efficiencies
between 2.2 and 5% of the wild-type activity at pH 7.0. More insightful
is the inspection of the steady-state turnover number, kcat, and the Michaelis constant, KM. With 14 s–1 R173K had still 32.5% of the
wild-type turnover, followed by R173A (6.5%), R173E (6.3%), and R173Q
(5.4%). By contrast, the KM value of R173K
was the highest (898 μM) followed by R173E (195 μM), R173Q
(130 μM), R173A (90 μM), and the wild-type protein (69
μM). If the conserved arginine residue is critical for binding
and stabilizing anionic substrates and intermediates, it seems peculiar
that the positively charged lysine in the mutant R173K had an even
lower affinity for chlorite than R173E. However, the spectral properties
of both ferric and ferrous R173K mutant (Table ) as well as the redox data (Table ) suggest
the existence of mainly low-spin ferric heme in R173K. A low-spin
heme was also detected in the R183K mutant of DaCld. The X-ray structure shows that the lysine side chain points
into the heme cavity to a water molecule that coordinates the Fe(III). Additionally, the lysine forms a hydrogen bond
with a trapped sulfate ion from the cryo-solution. The low-spin character of R173K could derive from the deprotonation
of the coordinating water in close proximity to two positively charged
species, that is, Fe(III) and the positively charged lysine side chain.
This would be consistent with the lower reduction potential of the
Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple compared to the native enzyme (ΔE°′ = −53 mV), as well as its nearly
independence from temperature (ΔS°′rc close to 0 J K–1 mol–1). Existence of a low-spin complex in R173K is also reflected by
a cyanide binding rate that is 3 orders of magnitude lower and a cyanide
complex dissociation constant that is 50-times higher than in wild-type
NdCld (Table ).

In the crystal structure
of R173E (Figure ), the side chain points
away from the heme iron. The ferric and
ferrous UV–vis spectra suggest a noticeable low-spin portion
in R173E. Despite the presence of the carboxylate group, the mutant
was still active and its KM value for
chlorite was only increased by a factor of 2.8. By contrast, it dramatically
decreased the rate of cyanide binding as well as the stability of
the resulting low-spin complex (Table ). If
R173 is exchanged by a neutral side chain, kcat is decreased by a factor of about 20 (R173A, R173Q), but KM is increased only by a factor of 1.3 (R173A)
and 1.9 (R173Q). Again, this decrease in chlorite degradation activity
and affinity for the anionic substrate is modest compared to the decrease
in the rate of cyanide binding as well as the stability of the resulting
cyanide complex.

These data suggest that the distal arginine
is important for chlorite
binding and reduction but not fully essential for reaction . Even in its absence chlorite can bind and react
with the ferric enzyme. The impact of exchange of Arg173 was significantly
more pronounced when the binding of cyanide was studied. At pH 7 cyanide
is protonated (pKa of HCN is 9.2) and
R173 is unprotonated (pKa of 6.5) as was
demonstrated recently. Arginine 173 must
therefore act as proton acceptor before cyanide can bind to the Lewis
acid Fe(III). Thus, R173 promotes the deprotonation reaction as well
as stabilization of the resulting cyanide complex (Table ). Binding to and oxidation of the enzyme by chlorite
(pKa = 1.97) does not need the presence
of a proton acceptor, but the arginine may support the attraction
of the anionic substrate to the heme cavity as well as contribute
to the stabilization of the initial Fe(III)-ClO2– complex. It is not as essential as is the distal histidine in heme
peroxidases that must deprotonate hydrogen peroxide before Compound
0 formation (i.e., Fe(III)-O-O-H complex) can occur. Most probably
R173 is more important in reaction  for keeping
hypochlorite in the reaction sphere for redox reaction with compound
I. Chlorite dismutases are inactivated during degradation of chlorite,
but the mechanism is unknown. It will be interesting to answer this
question in the near future using the R173 mutants designed in this
work.

The proximal heme cavity of functional chlorite dismutases
is characterized
by a conserved H-bonding network including H160-E210-K141. Its disruption
significantly alters the redox properties of the heme iron as well
as the ligand binding behavior at the distal side. In both E210A and
K141E, cyanide binding was almost completely impaired, and in the
latter variant the reduction potential was more positive than in the
native enzyme. Pronounced binding to molecular oxygen of the ferrous
form of E210A in the spectroelectrochemical experiments also suggests
some reorganization at the distal heme cavity. In wild-type NdCld,
the proximal histidine has some imidazolate character due to its H-bond
to E210. Upon exchange of E210 or neighboring K141, this noncovalent
bond is disrupted, H160 becomes neutral, and the electron density
at the heme iron is decreased. Simultaneously, the low-spin character
of the respective proteins increases (Figure  and ). Again, as
was already observed with the R173 variants, the impact of these structural
changes on the chlorite degradation capacity was much smaller compared
to the impact on the formation of the Cld-cyanide complex.

Generally,
the proximal H-bonding network in Clds seems to be very
labile and can easily be disrupted. While the mutant W146Y showed
wild-type-like biochemical and physical properties, exchange of tryptophan
145 by phenylalanine significantly increased the E°′ value of the Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple. This can be explained
by the X-ray structure of W145F that shows a complete break of the
H-bond between E210 and H160 thereby decreasing the electron density
at the heme iron. Thus, the proximal heme cavity architecture in chlorite
dismutases is very susceptible to perturbances. This could also be
the reason for the observed differences between NdCld and DaCld. Whereas the crystal
structures, show almost identical active sites, the
biophysical properties are very different. The reported Soret maximum
of ferric DaCld at 393 nm might reflect disruption of the interaction
between the heme iron and the proximal histidine. This assumption
is also supported by recent findings with proximal mutants of DaCld where the variant W155F (corresponding to W145F
in NdCld) showed dramatic differences compared to wild-type DaCld
including loss of the characteristic pentameric oligomerization state,
secondary structure as well as of the prosthetic group. The fact that
also proximal mutants of NdCld could be crystallized (whereas crystallization
of DaCld variants failed) suggests that
recombinant NdCld is the more suitable model Cld for future mechanistic
studies.
