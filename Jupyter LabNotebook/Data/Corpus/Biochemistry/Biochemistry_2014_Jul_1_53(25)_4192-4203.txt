Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58
is a plant pathogen
responsible for the formation of crown gall tumors and known for its
use in agricultural biotechnology. The close physical relationship
between A. tumefaciens C58 and plants (rich sources
of diverse sugars) combined with the fact that its genome encodes
five members of the mandelate racemase (MR) subgroup of the enolase
superfamily (ENS) with unknown functions and substrate specificities
suggests that A. tumefaciens C58 is a source of novel
sugar catabolic pathways. For example, Gci (UniProt entry A9CEQ8;
locus tag Atu3139), a member of the MR subgroup of the ENS, recently
was shown to catalyze the novel cycloisomerization of d-galactaro-1,4-lactone
(γ-galactarolactone) to 5-keto-4-deoxy-d-galactarate
in a pathway for degradation of d-galacturonate, the major
component of pectin found in plant cell walls. This pathway is initiated
by a uronate dehydrogenase that oxidizes d-galacturonate
to d-galactaro-1,5-lactone (δ-galactarolactone); a lactone isomerase (GLI; UniProt entry A9CEQ7;
locus tag Atu3138) then converts δ-galactarolactone to γ-galactarolactone, the substrate for Gci.

The ENS has &gt;30000
members in addition to the ubiquitous enolases. All members of the ENS share a common overall
structure: an N-terminal capping domain that contains the substrate
specificity-determining residues and a C-terminal barrel domain that
contains the catalytic residues. The active site is located at the
interface between the capping and barrel domains and is protected
from the solvent by flexible loops from the capping domain. In addition
to these structural similarities, members of the ENS share a common
mechanistic step, abstraction of a proton α to a carboxylate
group by an active site general base. Proton abstraction generates
an enolate intermediate that is stabilized by coordination to a conserved
magnesium ion.−

In this work, we describe the assignment of the in
vitro enzymatic activity to UniProt entry A9CG74 (locus tag
Atu4196),
a functionally uncharacterized member of the MR subgroup, which is
encoded by the A. tumefaciens C58 genome. Screening
of A9CG74 with a library of acid sugars and a semicarbazide assay
revealed dehydration of m-galactarate as well as
an activity with d-galacturonate. Previously reported m-galactarate dehydratases from the ENS, GalrD/TalrD and
GalrD-II, did not show activity with d-galacturonate,, nor did previously discovered d-galacturonate dehydratases,
GalurDs, show activity with m-galactarate (unpublished
work). Although details of the reaction mechanism for the reaction
with d-galacturonate remain to be established, the structure
of the observed product, 3-deoxy-d-xylo-hexarate
or 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexarate, suggests an
unexpected reaction for the ENS, abstraction of the proton α
to the aldehyde group to form 3-deoxy-d-threo-hexulosuronate that undergoes a 1,2-hydride transfer similar to
the benzylic acid rearrangement to form the observed 3-deoxy-d-xylo-hexarate or 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexarate.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification
The gene
encoding A9CG74 was amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
from genomic DNA isolated from A. tumefaciens C58
using Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR mixture contained
5 μL of 10× Pfx amplification buffer, 0.3 mM dNTPs, 1 mM
MgSO4, primers at 0.3 μM each (forward primer, 5′-CAT
GAG GAA GAC TGA CAT ATG AAA ATC GAT CGC ATG C-3′; reverse primer,
5′-CGA TGA AGC TCG AGT CAG GCG AAG GCA TAA GAA CC-3′),
1 unit of Pfx DNA polymerase, and 50 ng of genomic DNA in a total
volume of 50 μL. The amplification was performed using a PTC-200
gradient cycler (MJ Research) with the following cycling profile:
94 °C for 5 min; followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s,
60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min and 30 s; followed by
a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. The amplified gene was
cloned into the pET-17b vector using conventional cloning methods.
Proteins were expressed by growing 8 L of Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells in LB broth (supplemented with 100 μg/mL
ampicillin) at 37 °C while the sample was shaken at 220 rpm for
24 h. IPTG was not used to induce expression.

The genes encoding
A9CG74 orthologs UniProt entry B3Q5L5 (locus tag RHECIAT_PC0000418
from Rhizobium etli strain CIAT 652) and UniProt
entry B9JNP7 (locus tag Arad_7740 from Agrobacterium radiobacter strain K84) were cloned using ligation-independent cloning into
a pAVITAG tagless vector. The vector amplification reaction mixture
contained 5 μL of 10× KOD buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2, primers at 0.3 μM each (forward primer, 5′-AAC
CTC TAC TTC CAA TCG CAC CAT CAT CAC CAC CAT TG-3′; reverse
primer, 5′-TAT ATC TCC TTC TTA AGG TTA AAC AAA ATT ATT TCT
AG-3′), 10 ng of vector template, and 1 unit of KOD polymerase
in a total volume of 50 μL. The vector was amplified with the
following cycling profile: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles
of 95 °C for 30 s, 66 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45
s; the products were purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit
and eluted with 40 μL of water. The reaction mixture for amplifying
the genes contained 5 μL of 10× KOD buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs,
2 mM MgCl2, primers at 0.3 μM each (forward primer,
5′-TTA AGA AGG AGA TAT ACC ATG GTG N-3′, where N denotes
12 complementary nucleotides to the gene; reverse primer, 5′-GAT
TGG AAG TAG AGG TTC TCT GCN-3′, where N denotes 12 complementary
nucleotides to the gene), 10 ng of vector template, and 1 unit of
KOD polymerase in a total volume of 50 μL. Gene inserts and
vectors then were digested in separate reaction mixtures (10 μL)
containing 5 μL 10× buffer 2, 0.1 μL of 100×
bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mM dNTPs, and 1 unit of T4 DNA polymerase.
The digestions were incubated at 22 °C for 60 min followed by
75 °C for 20 min. The digested vector (15 ng) was then combined
with 2 μL of the digested insert and incubated at 22 °C
for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mM EDTA.
The plasmids were transformed into E. coli DH10B
cells using heat shock. Proteins were expressed by growing 8 L of E. coli strain DH10B cells grown in 8 L of LB broth (supplemented
with 100 μg/mL ampicillin) at 37 °C while the sample was
being shaken at 220 rpm rpm for 24 h. IPTG was not used to induce
expression.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4650g and
4 °C) and resuspended in 30–40 mL of low-salt buffer [20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 5 mM MgCl2]. Cells were lysed
by sonication and pelleted by centrifugation (31000g and 4 °C) to remove cell debris. The supernatant was loaded
onto a 125 mL Dowex DEAE column equilibrated with 1250 mL of low-salt
buffer. The column was washed with 800 mL of low-salt buffer, and
the protein was eluted with a linear 1800 mL gradient of 0 to 50%
high-salt buffer [1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and 5 mM MgCl2] followed by 300 mL of 100% high-salt buffer. The purity
was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Fractions containing the protein
of the appropriate size were pooled and loaded onto a 20 mL Q-Sepharose
column equilibrated with 200 mL of low-salt buffer. The column was
washed with 100 mL of high-salt buffer, and the protein was eluted
with a linear 700 mL gradient of 100 to 0% high-salt buffer. The purity
was checked by SDS–PAGE. Fractions containing the protein of
the appropriate size were pooled and brought to a final concentration
of 1 M (NH3)2SO4 before being loaded
onto a 50 mL Phenyl Sepharose column. The column was washed with 100
mL of ammonium sulfate buffer [1 M (NH3)2SO4, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and 5 mM MgCl2], and
protein was eluted with a 200 mL linear gradient of 100 to 0% ammonium
sulfate buffer. The protein purity was checked via SDS–PAGE.

The gene encoding DHDPS Pfam family member Q7CU96 (locus tag Atu4189
from A. tumefaciens C58) was cloned into the pMAL-c2x
vector containing a maltose binding protein (MBP) tag using Gibson
assembly because of incompatible restriction
enzyme sites. Separate amplifications of the vector and gene were
performed to incorporate regions of homology, followed by incorporation
of the gene into the vector using the homologous regions. Primers
were designed using a 25 bp overlap with the terminal ends of the
gene encoding Q7CU96 and with a 30 bp overlap with the pMAL-c2x vector.
The reaction mixture for amplification of the vector (50 μL)
contained 20 ng of pMAL-c2x vector template, vector amplification
primers at 0.5 μM each (forward primer, 5′-TGA AAT CCT
TCC CTC GAT CCC GAG GTT GTT G-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAA
TTC GGA TCC TCT AGA GTC GAC CTG CAG GCA AGC-3′), 0.4 mM dNTPs,
10 μL of 5× HF buffer, 3% DMSO, and 1 unit of Phusion DNA
polymerase. The vector reaction was amplified using the following
cycling profile: 95 °C for 30 s; followed by three cycles of
95 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min;
followed by three cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 30
s, and 72 °C for 5 min; followed by 26 cycles of 95 °C for
10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min; followed by a
final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture for
amplification of the gene (50 μL) contained 15 ng of Q7CU96
template in pET28a vector, insert amplification primers at 0.5 μM
each (forward primer, 5′-CAA CAA CCT CGG GAT CGA GGG AAG GAT
TTC AAT GAC GAC ATT TGA TAT TCG CCA G-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCT
TGC CTG CAG GTC GAC TCT AGA GGA TCC GAA TTC TTA TTT CCA GCT GGC CAG
CAG G-3′). The reaction was amplified as follows: 98 °C
for 4 min; followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 55 °C
for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; followed by a final extension at
72 °C for 7 min. After amplification, 25 μL of each PCR
product was digested for 16 h at 37 °C with 20 units of DpnI
enzyme. Assembly of the full-length DNA construct (20 μL total)
was achieved using 35 ng of pMAL vector, 35 ng of the gene of interest,
and 15 μL of 1.33× assembly mix. The assembly mix was incubated
at 60 °C for 5 min, 4 °C for 5 min, and finally 50 °C
for 60 min. The solution was then dialyzed and electroporated into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in LB at 37 °C while
the sample was being shaken at 220 rpm. When the OD600 reached
0.5, the cells were induced by addition of IPTG to a final concentration
of 1 mM. Growth was continued at 20 °C with shaking at 220 rpm
for an additional 16 h, at which point the cells were harvested as
described above. The cells were sonicated, clarified, and loaded onto
a 60 mL amylose column equilibrated with binding buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 M NaCl]. The column was then
washed with 720 mL of binding buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM
MgCl2, and 0.2 M NaCl]. The MBP-tagged protein was eluted
with 240 mL of maltose elution buffer [20 mM maltose, 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.9), and 0.2 M NaCl]. The column was then washed with 180 mL
of water, 180 mL of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 180 mL of water
and finally equilibrated with 360 mL of binding buffer. Fractions
containing the MBP-tagged protein were pooled, and Factor Xa was used
to cleave the MBP tag in 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) dialysis
tubing during dialysis against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 2 mM CaCl2, and 0.15 M NaCl for 16 h at 4 °C. The protein was then
loaded onto a 125 mL DEAE column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.9) and 5 mM MgCl2. The column was washed with 600
mL of binding buffer followed by a linear gradient over 750 mL to
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 M NaCl. Fractions
containing the enzyme (32 kDa) were pooled and loaded on the amylose
column to remove the MBP tag (42 kDa) using the same method that is
described above but instead by collecting the flow-through.

Screening
A9CG74, B3Q5L5, and B9JNP7 with a Library of Acid
Sugars
Proteins were screened for dehydration using a library
of 77 mono- and diacid sugars as previously described. Reactions (50 μL) were performed in UV-transparent
96-well plates (Corning) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM substrate, and 1 μM enzyme. The reaction
mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h before the addition
of 250 μL of a 1% sodium acetate/1% semicarbazide mixture (semicarbazide
solution); the plates were incubated for at least 1 h before the absorbance
was recorded at 250 nm (ε250 = 10200 M–1 cm–1) with a Tecan Plate Reader.

Kinetic Assay
for m-Galactarate Dehydratase
Activity
The rate of m-galactarate dehydration
was determined by performing an end-point semicarbazide assay. For
each reaction, 1 μM A9CG74 was incubated with 0.1–10
mM m-galactarate in 20 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) (pH 7.9) and 5 mM MgCl2. Aliquots were taken
at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 min and quenched with 5 volumes of a semicarbazide
solution. After incubation for 1 h at 22 °C, the absorbance at
250 nm was recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda14 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
Kinetic constants were determined using OriginPro.

Polarimetric
Assay for Determining the Regiospecificity of A9CG74
The
regiochemical preference of A9CG74 for dehydration of m-galactarate was determined by combining 5 mM m-galactarate,
10 μM enzyme, and 5 mM MgCl2 in 50
mM HEPES (pH 8.0) and monitoring the progress of the reaction using
a Jasco P-1010 polarimeter. The change in optical rotation was recorded
at 20 °C using a sodium line filter (589 nm), a 10 cm path-length
cuvette, and a 1 s integration time for 30 min. The specific optical
rotation was calculated for each sample.

1H NMR Spectra
of the m-Galactarate
Dehydration and the d-Galacturonate Reaction Products
All 1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Unity INOVA
500NB MHz spectrometer unless otherwise noted. Dehydration reactions
were performed in H2O solvent (800 μL total) containing
20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.9), 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM sugar,
and 10 μM enzyme. Reaction mixtures in which m-galactarate was the substrate were incubated for 16 h at 22 °C,
and reaction mixtures in which d-galacturonate was the substrate
were incubated for 1 week at 22 °C. The reaction mixtures were
lyophilized; the residue was dissolved in 800 μL of D2O before the 1H NMR spectra were recorded. For the reaction
with m-galactarate, the pD was adjusted to 2 with
5 μL of 1 M DCl.

Stereochemical Assignment of Solvent Hydrogen
Incorporation
A9CG74 was exchanged into a deuterated buffer
by diluting 1 mL
of 200 μM enzyme into 9 mL of potassium phosphate buffer at
pD 8.1 made using 99.9% D2O and concentrating the enzyme
to 1 mL using a 10 mL Amicon filter with a Millipore 10000 MWCO poly(ether
sulfone) ultrafiltration membrane; this procedure was repeated five
times. A reaction mixture (800 μL) containing 2 mM substrate,
5 mM MgCl2, and 10 μM enzyme in 20 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pD 8.1) was incubated at 22 °C overnight. For the reaction
in which galactarate was the substrate, the pD was adjusted to 2.0
with DCl before the 1H NMR spectra were recorded.

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis of A9CG74 and Activity Assays
Mutants were constructed
using the single-overlap extension procedure.
The first PCR mixture to generate the megaprimers (50 μL) contained
50 ng of the pET-17b vector containing the gene encoding A9CG74, primers
at 0.5 mM each, 10 μL of 5× GC buffer, 3% DMSO, 0.4 mM
dNTPs, and 1 unit of Phusion DNA polymerase. The 5′-megaprimer
was generated by pairing the T7pro primer with an antisense primer
containing the desired mutation (Table S1 of the ). The 3′-megaprimer was generated
by pairing the T7term primer with a sense primer containing the desired
mutation. The PCR cycle was as follows: 98 °C for 4 min; followed
by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C
for 30 s; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The
megaprimers were gel-purified (Qiagen) and used to generate the full-length
mutant gene. The PCR mixture (50 μL) for amplifying the full-length
mutant gene contained 40 ng of each megaprimer, 10 μL of 5×
GC buffer, 3% DMSO, 0.4 mM dNTPs, and 1 unit of Phusion DNA polymerase.
An initial PCR program to extend the megaprimers was performed as
follows: 98 °C for 4 min followed by five cycles of 98 °C
for 20 s, 55 °C for 25 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Next, T7pro
and T7term primers were added to bring the final primer concentration
to 0.5 mM, and the PCR program was continued as follows: 35 cycles
of 98 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 25
s followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 5 min. The
full-length mutant genes were then gel-purified and ligated into the
pET17b vector. Proteins were expressed and purified as described for
the wild-type A9CG74 protein.

The H191N and H292Q mutant proteins
were assayed by incubating 1 μM enzyme with 2–10 mM m-galactarate using the same method described for the wild-type
enzyme. No turnover was detected. These were also assayed for d-galacturonate activity using the 1H NMR assay described
above, and no reaction was observed.

Determination of the Activity
of Q7CU96 (DHDPS member)
Q7CU96 was tested for activity on
the product of the A9CG74 reaction,
2-keto-3-deoxy-d-galactarate (2k3dgalr), and its enantiomer,
5-keto-4-deoxy-d-glucarate (KDG). To synthesize 2k3dgalr,
a 2 mL reaction mixture containing 20 μM A9CG74, 40 mM m-galactarate, 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.9), and 2
mM MgCl2 was incubated at 22 °C for 16 h. When the
reaction was complete, the product was verified by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. The solution was stored in 0.5 mL aliquots at −20
°C. For the synthesis of KDG, a 2 mL reaction mixture containing
100 μM d-glucarate dehydratase from E. coli, 50 mM d-glucarate, 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.9), and 2 mM MgCl2 was incubated at 22 °C for 16
h. The product was verified and stored as described for 2k3dgalr.

Q7CU96 was tested for aldolase activity with both 2k3dgalr and KDG
in a coupled enzyme assay containing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
The reaction mixture (1 mL) contained 10 mM substrate, 100 μM
Q7CU96, 2 units of LDH, 0.1 mM NADH, 75 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.9), and 15 mM MgSO4. The decrease in absorbance at
340 nm was monitored for 10 min.

Q7CU96 was tested for dehydratase/decarboxylase
activity with both
2k3dgalr and KDG in a coupled enzyme assay containing α-ketoglutarate
semialdehyde dehydrogenase (αKGSDH, UniProt entry Q9I1Q0 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and diaphorase. In this reaction,
Q7CU96 decarboxylates 2k3dgalr to form α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde
that is oxidized by αKGSDH with NAD+ to form α-ketoglutarate
and NADH. The reduction of iodonitrotetrazolium (INT) by diaphorase
using NADH was detected at 500 nm. The reaction mixture (1 mL) contained
2 mM substrate, 1 μM Q7CU96, 0.1 μM αKGSDH, 4 units
of diaphorase, 1.6 mM INT, 0.16 mM NAD+, 75 mM HEPES (pH
7.9), and 2 mM MgSO4; 10 μM Q7CU96 was required to
detect activity when KDG was used as the substrate. Reaction rates
were measured for both substrates using the same assay. For 2k3dgalr,
the substrate concentrations varied from 2 to 500 μM and 0.1
μM Q7CU96 was used; for KDG, substrate concentrations varied
from 10 μM to 5 mM and 10 μM Q7CU96 was used. Kinetic
constants were determined using OriginPro.

A 1H NMR
spectrum of the reaction mixture (800 μL)
was obtained using the following conditions: 2 mM 2k3dgalr, 10 μM
Q7CU96, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.9), and 2 mM MgCl.

Crystallization and Structure Determination
B9JNP7,
an orthologue of A9CG74, was crystallized by sitting drop vapor diffusion
using 96-well Intelliplates (Douglas Instruments). Crystallization
drops were assembled by combining 0.5 μL of protein [11 mg/mL
in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 M NaCl]
with 0.5 μL of reservoir buffer. Crystals grew from several
conditions, yielding a sulfate-liganded structure [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) entry 4JN7] that crystallized in 2 M ammonium sulfate and 100 mM Bis-Tris-HCl
(pH 5.5) and an l-malate/Na2+-liganded structure
(PDB entry 4JN8) that crystallized in 20% PEG3350 and a 0.15 mM mixture of racemic
malate. Dodecahedron-shaped crystals grew from both conditions with
dimensions of 100 μm on a side and were of the same space group
(I422), although they had slightly different unit
cell dimensions. Single crystals were extracted, transferred to the
reservoir condition supplemented with either 20% glycerol (4JN8) or 20% ethylene
glycol (4JN7), and vitrified by being plunged in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected
at the Advanced Photon Source (beamline 31-ID of Argonne National
Laboratory) using a wavelength of 0.9788 Å and a Rayonix 225
HE detector (Rayonix, LLC). Data were integrated in MOSFLM and scaled using SCALA. The automated molecular replacement program BALBES calculated a number of molecular replacement models and
output a potential solution utilizing 3RR1 (31% identical sequence)
as the search model. The automated building program ARP/WARP was used to fit the majority of the structure,
followed by iterative rounds of model building within COOT and refinement within PHENIX. The structures contained a single polypeptide per asymmetric
unit with a solvent content of 50%. The identity of the metal ion
in the l-malate structure was based on the average distance
to the protein ligands and the malate ion, all of which were approximately
2.4 Å, consistent with Na2+ instead of Mg2+. The quality and stereochemistry of the final structure were verified
using MOLPROBITY (refinement statistics
listed in Table ).

Modeling m-Galactarate and d-Galacturonate
into the Crystal Structure of PDB Entry 4NJ7
To examine the potential modes
of binding of m-galactarate and d-galacturonate,
both compounds were docked in the active site of the crystal structure
(PDB entry 4JN7) of B9JNP7 liganded with l-malate. PRIME docking, an anchor-and-grow
docking method, was used. Briefly, a ligand was built from a core
fragment (l-malate), and the conformations were sampled to
identify the low-energy pose of the ligand. PRIME docking uses an
all-atom OPLS force field with a generalized Born implicit solvent
model for all energy evaluations and samples ligand conformations
in dihedral angle space. All atoms from l-malate other than the carboxylate group that coordinates to
Arg382 and the carbon atom α to the carboxylate group were removed
to create the core fragment. Both ligands were built using the Maestro
(version 9.3.35) Edit/Build panel. The ligands were subsequently energy
minimized and converted into dockable forms using LigPrep (version
4.0515). Parameter files were generated for the ligands using the
utility script hetgrp_ffgen (Schrodinger Inc.). PRIME docking then
built the ligand from the core fragment in an arbitrary conformation
in the active site. The conformations of the ligand were sampled by
gradually varying the dihedral angles in 10° increments. The
conformations were clustered into 50 different bins, and one conformation
from each bin was energy minimized in the active site. The conformation
with the lowest energy was selected. The core fragment atoms of each
ligand were docked in two different binding modes, i.e., alternate
ends of the ligand coordinating to Arg382. After the low-energy poses
were identified, the relative binding energy of the ligands corresponding
to each pose was evaluated. The relative binding energies corresponding
to two alternate poses of m-galactarate and d-galacturonate are listed in Table .

RT-qPCR
of RNA Isolated from A. tumefaciens C58
A single colony of A. tumefaciens C58
from a plated culture was used to inoculate 5 mL of Agrobacterium minimal medium (ABM) [3 g/L K2HPO4, 1 g/L NaH2PO4, 1 g/L NH4Cl, 0.3 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.15 g/L
KCl, 0.01 g/L CaCl2·2H2O, and 0.0025 g/L
FeSO4·7H2O (pH 7.0)] containing 0.4% d-glucose. After the OD600 reached 1, the cells were
washed five times as follows. The culture was dispensed into 1.5 mL
Eppendorf tubes and pelleted in a table-top Eppendorf centrifuge at
8000 rpm for 1 min; the cell pellet was then resuspended in 0.5 mL
of ABM lacking a carbon source. After five washes, the cells were
resuspended in 0.5 mL of ABM lacking a carbon source and used to inoculate
ABM containing either 0.4% d-glucose or d-galacturonate
as the sole carbon source. The cell density of each culture was then
brought to an OD600 of 0.1 by dilution into Agrobacterium minimal medium. Cells were harvested
when the OD600 reached 0.2 by adding an equal volume of
RNAlater solution (Qiagen), incubating at 22 °C for 5 min before
pelleting, and then removing the supernatant. The cell pellets were
frozen at −20 °C until all pellets were harvested. Total
RNA was isolated from the cells using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen).

cDNA was reverse-transcribed using the ProtoScript M-MuLV First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly,
a mixture of 300 ng of RNA and 2 μL of 50 mM random hexamers
was brought to a final volume of 8 μL and incubated for 10 min
at 65 °C to denature the nucleic acid; this was performed for
RNA harvested from cells grown on glucose and cells grown on d-galacturonate. Ten microliters of 2× ProtoScript II Reaction
Mix and 2 μL of 20X ProtoScript II Enzyme mix were added to
each reaction mixture, and the mixtures were incubated at 42 °C
for 1 h followed by 85 °C for 5 min. A negative control containing
water instead of reverse transcriptase was generated using the same
procedure.

RT-qPCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 (Roche).
Reaction
mixtures (10 μL) contained primers at 0.5 μM each, 15
ng of cDNA, and 5 μL of 2× SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche).
Reaction mixtures were cycled with an initial hold at 95 °C for
5 min followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for
10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s during which SYBR green fluorescence
was monitored. ΔCp (change in crossing
point) and ΔΔCp were calculated
for each carbon source. The fold change compared to the glucose control
was determined using the formula 2–ΔΔCp.

RNA-Seq of RNA Isolated
from A. tumefaciens C58
A
single colony of A. tumefaciens C58
was used to inoculate 5 mL of 0.4% d-glucose-supplemented Agrobacterium minimal medium and grown to an OD600 of 0.5. Cells were washed twice to remove the carbon source
and then inoculated into 0.4% d-galacturonate or 0.4% d-glucose minimal medium and grown for 2 h. RNA was then harvested
as described above. Samples were submitted to the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology
Center for library preparation, data collection, and analysis.

Results
and Discussion
Eight of the 12 ENS members encoded by the A. tumefaciens C58 genome are members of the MR subgroup.
A9CG74 has a DxH motif
at the end of β-strand 3 similar to the catalytic residues in d-galactonate dehydratases (Figure )
but does not catalyze the dehydration of d-galactonate; d-galactonate dehydratases do not catalyze the dehydration of m-galactarate or d-galacturonate. A9CG74’s in vitro activity was
determined using biochemical assays, and its biological function was
established by transcriptomics.

Bioinformatics of A9CG74
and Its Homologues
In a sequence
similarity network, A9CG74 clusters with ∼25 other proteins
at a BLASTP e-value cutoff of 10–85 (Figure ). The sequences of members of this
cluster are &gt;60% identical, and they are from either Agrobacterium or Rhizobium, each of which is a member of the Rhizobiaceae family. An alignment
of the sequences in this cluster shows that both the active site catalytic
residues and substrate binding residues in the capping domain are
conserved (Figure ). The enzymes in this cluster
likely are orthologues based on sequence identity and shared catalytic/substrate
specificity-determining residues.

its sequence is &gt;60% identical with those of other members of this
cluster.

RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR on
Neighboring Genes
The A9CG74
genome neighborhood encodes eight genes that are conserved in the
genome neighborhoods of other members of the cluster: Q9CU96 (locus
tag Atu4189), a member of the dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS)
superfamily; Q7CU97 (locus tag Atu4190), a potential lactonase; Q7CU98
(locus tag Atu4191), GntR regulator; Q7CU99 (locus tag Atu4192), Q7CUA0
(locus tag Atu4193), A9CG73 (locus tag Atu4194), and Q7CUA2 (locus
tag Atu4195), ABC transporters; and A9CG75 (locus tag Atu4197), mutarotase
(Figure ). The species of Agrobacterium in this cluster share most of these genes, except that a LysM gene,
which encodes a cell wall lytic protein, replaces the mutarotase in
the A. radiobacter K84 genome. Additional differences
are present in the Rhizobia members, e.g., the absence of a mutarotase
and the presence of an additional ENS member (Figure , gene A). An additional NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase
is located adjacent to the GntR regulator (Figure , gene B). Rhizobia also contain an additional dipeptide transport
system and conserved genes, including a flavoprotein and a nitroreductase.
Because these genes are not conserved, they likely are not necessary
for the metabolism of m-galactarate.

The bracket denotes a partially sequenced genome.

We sought to determine which of the neighboring genes are
upregulated
when A. tumefaciens C58 is grown on d-galacturonate
as a carbon source. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that A9CG74
and its surrounding genes were upregulated (Figure ); however, the genome encodes at least two additional pathways
for d-galacturonate degradation, so it is possible that the
genes in the genome neighborhood of A9CG74 are part of a much larger
set of coregulated genes involved in d-galacturonate metabolism,
of which those involved in m-galactarate degradation
are a subset.

Upregulation of the A9CG74 genome neighborhood genes when A. tumefaciens C58 is grown on d-galacturonate
compared to d-glucose. Gene annotations: (1) galactarate
dehydratase III, (2) mutarotase, (3) a potential lactonase, and (4)
dehydratase/decarboxylase (DHDPS).

Transcript analysis was performed to determine which genes
are
cotranscribed. The genes encoding Q7CU96 (locus tag Atu4189, a member
of the DHDHPS superfamily) and the potential lactonase Q7CU97 (locus
tag Atu4190) were found to be on the same transcript (Figure , lane 3); furthermore, the genes encoding the mutarotase
A9CG75 (locus tag Atu4197) and GalrD-III A9CG74 (locus tag Atu4196)
were found to be on the same transcript (Figure , lane 4). Although the mutarotase could not utilize m-galactarate, d-galacturonate is a substrate (data not shown);
the mutarotase could be involved in the conversion of d-galacturonate
to galactarate by catalyzing interconversion of the hemiacetals of d-galacturonate, one of which likely is a substrate for a uronate
dehydrogenase., Additional experiments would
be needed to determine the physiological role of the mutarotase encoded
by A9CG75.

Transcript analysis of the amplified product from cDNA constructed
starting from cells grown on d-galacturonate vs Agrobacterium gDNA. Amplification from cDNA shows adjacent genes A9CG74 and A9CG75
are cotranscribed as are adjacent genes Q7CU96 and Q7CU97: lane 1,
NEB 1 kb ladder; lane 2, NEB 100 bp ladder; lane 3, amplicon from
primers spanning the intergenic region between A9CG74 and A9CG75 from
cDNA (expected size of 550 bp); lane 4, amplicon from primers spanning
the intergenic region between Q7CU96 and Q7CU97 (expected size of
950 bp); lane 5, same as lane 3 but from gDNA (expected size of 550
bp); lane 6, same as lane 4 but from gDNA (expected size of 950 bp).

RT-qPCR and transcriptional analysis
allowed us to establish the
neighboring genes that are upregulated and likely involved in m-galactarate metabolism, focusing the possible genes involved
in a metabolic pathway in Agrobacterium to A9CG74,
Q7CU97, and Q7CU96. Both A9CG74 and Q7CU96 were successfully purified
and functionally characterized. Unfortunately, Q7CU97 was insoluble.

A9CG74 (GalrD-III) and Its Orthologues Are m-Galactarate
Dehydratases
Screening A9CG74 with a library
of 77 acid sugars revealed dehydration of m-galactarate
as well as a semicarbazide “hit” for d-galacturonate
(vide infra). This laboratory previously reported
two orthologous families of galactarate dehydratases in the enolase
superfamily, GalrD/TalrD and GalrD-II; however, the active site residues
in those enzymes differ from those found in A9CG74., Kinetic
constants for A9CG74 with m-galactarate were determined
with an end point assay (kcat = 0.12 ±
0.05 s–1; Km = 80 ±
30 μM; kcat/Km = 1.5 × 103 M–1 s–1) and are similar to those previously reported for GalrD/TalrD and
GalrD-II., B3Q5L5 and B9JNP7, orthologues of A9GC74,
also showed similar screening results (Table ). Thus, we conclude that A9CG74, B9JNP7, and B5Q5L5 are orthologous
galactarate dehydratases with catalytic residues unlike those previously
described for galactarate dehydratases in the ENS.

X-ray Structure
An X-ray structure of GalrD-III from A. radiobacter K84 (UniProt entry B9JNP7, with l-malate and Na+; PDB entry 4JN7) was determined that showed an (α+β)
capping domain and a (β/α)7 β-barrel
domain characteristic of enolase superfamily members. The α+β
capping domain contains residues 1–115 at the N-terminus and
residues 322–395 at C-terminus of the polypeptide; the barrel
domain contains residues 116–321.

Residues located in
20s and 50s loops in the capping domain interact with the substrate,
determining substrate specificity. In GalrD-III, both the 20s loop
and 50s loops are short, containing residues 14–16 and 35–39,
respectively; Arg 16 from the 20s loop forms H-bonds with the nearby
carboxylate group of the substrate, and Y36 from the 50s loop forms
H-bonds with both the carboxylate and the hydroxyl oxygen on the adjacent
carbon. The C-terminus containing residues 375–395 extends
near the active site, allowing Arg 382 to form H-bonds with the proximal
carboxylate group of the substrate (Figure A).

Structure of GalrD-III (PDB entry 4JN7) liganded with l-malate (magenta)
and Na+ (purple). (A) Overall structure. Loops containing
residues for substrate specificity are colored yellow. (B) Active
site view with l-malate colored magenta, substrate specificity
residues (R382, R16, and Y36) colored yellow, catalytic residues (H191
and H292) colored orange, and metal binding residues (D189, E216,
and E242) colored green.

The ligands that coordinate the essential Mg2+ ion are
Asp 189, Glu 216, and Glu 242 located at the C-terminal ends of β-strands
3–5, respectively (Figure B). As expected
for a member of the MR subgroup, His 292, located at the C-terminal
end of β-strand 7, forms a hydrogen-bonded dyad with Asp 265,
located at the C-terminal end of β-strand 6; together, these
residues act as the general basic catalyst that initiates the reaction.

Unlike other MR members that contain two Lys residues at the C-terminal
end of β-strand 2, GalrD-III contains a KxS motif consisting
of Lys 149 and Ser 151 at β-strand 2 that would not be catalytic.
Instead, GalrD-III shows a catalytic DxH motif at the C-terminal end
of β-strand 3 as observed in d-galactonate dehydratase, containing Asp 189 that coordinates the essential
Mg2+ and His 191 that would be the general acid catalyst
for dehydration (Figure B).

Regiochemistry
of Galactarate Dehydration
As a diacid, m-galactarate has two stereochemically distinct α-protons
available for abstraction. Thus, two enantiomeric “2-keto-3-deoxy
galactarate” products are possible. Polarimetry was used to
determine the configuration of the A9CG74 product by comparing its
optical rotation to those reported for GalrD/TalrD and GalrD-II that
abstract the α proton from different “ends” of m-galactarate., The specific optical
rotations ([α]58920) for the products
of the GalrD/TalrD- and GalrD-II-catalyzed reactions are +4°
and −4°, respectively., The specific
optical rotations for the products produced by A9CG74, B9JNP7, and
B5Q5L5 are −4°; i.e., the orthologues produce 2-keto-d-threo-4,5-dihydroxyadipate as observed for
the GalrD-II-catalyzed reaction.

Stereochemistry of Galactarate
Dehydration
A sequence
alignment of members of the cluster containing A9CG74 revealed a conserved
KxS motif at the end of β-strand 2, a conserved DxH motif at
the end of β-strand 3, and the His-Asp dyad at the ends of β-strands
7 and 6, respectively. These catalytic residues are similar to those
in d-galactonate dehydratase (Figure ). To determine whether His residues in the DxH motif and His-Asp
dyad are important, H191N (β-strand 3) and H292Q (β-strand
7) were characterized. Neither mutant was active with either m-galactarate or d-galacturonate, confirming their
importance.

The stereochemical course of dehydration of m-galactarate catalyzed by A9CG74 was determined by comparing
the 1H NMR spectra of the products obtained in D2O and H2O; solvent-derived deuterium is incorporated into
the 3-pro-S position (Figure ). Using the model with m-galactarate in the active
site (Figure A), we propose the mechanism
shown in Figure . On the basis of its proximity
to the α-proton, His 292 abstracts the proton from the α-carbon.
His 191, which forms an H-bond with the departing hydroxide at C3,
facilitates the departure of the hydroxide leaving group. This model
shows that Lys 149 from the KxS motif at the C-terminal end of β-strand
2 is not involved in catalysis but rather is involved in coordinating
the substrate. Lys 149 forms an H-bond with one carboxylate of the m-galactarate substrate; similarly, when d-galacturonate
is modeled into the active site, Lys 149 forms an H-bond with the
aldehyde.

Lys 149 that forms an H-bond with the substrate is colored tan and
the essential Mg2+ light green. His 292 is positioned to

The aldehyde functional group instead of the carboxylate of d-galacturonate is coordinated to the Mg2+ ion. His 292
is positioned to abstract the proton located α to the aldehyde
group. Residue colors are the same as in panel A.

Proposed mechanism for the dehydration of m-galactarate
by GalrD-III. Proton abstraction is performed by His 292 followed
by general acid-catalyzed dehydration by His 191. H292 then facilitates
tautomerization to the final product, 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate.

A9CG74 Catalyzes a Novel
Dehydration Reaction with d-Galacturonate
The acid
sugar library screening of A9CG74
revealed low-level activity with d-galacturonate. However,
the 1H NMR spectrum of the product formed after incubation
for several days was not that expected for dehydration initiated by
abstraction of the proton α to the carboxylate group (Figure ). Instead, the product was identified as either
3-deoxy-d-xylo-hexarate or 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexarate on the basis of the 1H–13C HSQC and 13C NMR spectra (Figures S1 and S2
of the ). Because
neither of these products will react with semicarbazide, we hypothesized
that an intermediate that would react with semicarbazide (such as
a dehydration product) was formed and later consumed. When B9JNP7
and B5Q5L5, other members of this cluster, were incubated with d-galacturonate, the same product was formed.

Representative 1H NMR spectra of the product of the
reaction of A9CG74 with d-galacturonate as a substrate. (A)
Spectrum of the product when d-galacturonate is incubated
with GalrD-III for 1 week in H2O at pH 7.9. (B) Spectrum
of the product when d-galacturonate is incubated with GalrD-III
for 1 week in D2O at pH 7.9.

We rationalize the formation of this unexpected product as
follows.
Instead of catalysis of dehydration by abstraction of the proton from
the carbon α to the carboxylate group, the proton α to
the aldehyde group is abstracted, resulting in a semicarbazide active
product; then, the dehydration product undergoes a reaction similar
to the benzilic acid rearrangement (a 1,2-hydride transfer) in which
the aldehyde group is oxidized to a carboxylate group and the adjacent
carbonyl group is reduced to an alcohol (Figure ).

Proposed mechanism for the reaction of GalrD-III using d-galacturonate. Rather than abstraction of the proton α
to
the carboxylate from d-galacturonate (1), the
proton α to the aldehyde is abstracted and dehydration occurs
to yield 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexulosuronate (2). A rearrangement similar to the benzylic acid rearrangement
(1,2-hydride shift) yields 3-deoxy-d-xylo-hexarate or 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexarate (3) (uncertain stereochemistry at C2).

The ability of A9CG74 and orthologues to catalyze this reaction
reveals the ability of members of the ENS to catalyze an unexpected
reaction, although we propose that the active site stabilizes the
enolate anion obtained by abstraction of the proton α to the
aldehyde group by bidentate coordination to the active site Mg2+ as well-established for reactions catalyzed by MR and previously
characterized acid sugar dehydratases in the MR subgroup (including
dehydration of m-galactarate by A9CG74). On the basis
of the lowest-energy modeled structure of d-galacturonate
in the active site of B9JNP7 (PDB entry 4NJ7), the aldehyde oxygen instead of one
of the carboxylate oxygens coordinates to the Mg2+ (Figure B). On the basis of this model, we propose that
His 292 catalyzes abstraction of the proton from the carbon α
to the aldehyde group. Dehydration would then occur by His 191 functioning
as the general acid that facilitates departure of the hydroxide leaving
group, yielding compound 2 (Figure ). Compound 2 then undergoes a 1,2-hydride transfer
similar to the benzylic acid rearrangement to produce 3-deoxy-d-xylo-hexarate or 3-deoxy-d-lyxo-hexarate (Figure , compound 3). The mechanism of this reaction
was not investigated.

Q7CU96 Is a Dehydratase/Decarboxylase That
Acts on 2-Keto-3-deoxy-galactarate
Both RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR
experiments confirmed that the gene encoding
Q7CU96, a member of the dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) superfamily
and proximal to the gene encoding A9CG74, is upregulated when A. tumefaciens C58 is grown on d-galacturonate
(a possible metabolic precursor to m-galactarate)
as a carbon source (Figure ). The upregulation
and proximity of these genes suggest that Q7CU96 may participate downstream
of A9CG74 in a metabolic pathway for m-galactarate
degradation. Q7CU96 was tested for activity on the product of the
A9CG74 reaction, 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate, as well as its enantiomer,
5-keto-4-deoxy-d-glucarate., Q7CU96 is
similar in sequence to other DHDPS members known to be aldolases,
suggesting that it is the aldolase that cleaves 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate
to pyruvate and tartronate semialdehyde. This activity was investigated
using a lactate dehydrogenase coupled assay that would reduce pyruvate
to lactate using NADH; however, no activity was observed.

Next,
the ability of Q7CU96 to catalyze dehydration of 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate
followed by vinylogous decarboxylation was tested by monitoring the
formation of α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde by coupling the reaction
with α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (αKGSDH),
an enzyme that oxidizes α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde to α-ketoglutarate
using NAD+ (Figure A). Activity
was detected, and the kinetic constants were determined: kcat = 1.6 ± 0.1 s–1, Km = 27 ± 9 μM, and kcat/Km = 5.9 × 104 M–1 s–1. The formation of α-ketoglutarate
semialdehyde was confirmed using 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure B). Thus, together, A9CG74 and Q7CU96 transform m-galactarate to α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde that
would be oxidized to α-ketoglutarate.

(B) Partial 1H NMR spectrum of the product of the reaction
of Q7CU96 with 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate as the substrate. The peak
at 4.87 ppm corresponds to the proton on C5; the multiplet at 1.95–2.15
ppm corresponds to the remaining protons on C3 and C4.

Conclusions
From both in
vitro enzymatic activity and in vivo transcriptomics,
we propose that the dehydration
of m-galactarate is the physiological function of
A9CG74 and that the product of this reaction, 2-keto-3-deoxy-galactarate,
is converted to α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde and then α-ketoglutarate.
We propose the name GalrD-III to indicate both the physiological role
and its mechanistic uniqueness from previously reported galactarate
dehydratases that do not contain the same active site residues., The unexpected, unprecedented reaction observed with d-galacturonate,
abstraction of the proton α to an aldehyde group, suggests that
aldoses could be substrates for uncharacterized members of the ENS.
