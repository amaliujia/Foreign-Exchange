The Arabidopsis
thaliana H+-ATPase genes, AHA1 and AHA2, belong to a protein family of eleven
100 kDa, plasma membrane-localized P-type ATPases. AHA proteins belong
to the electrogenic class of P-type ATPases responsible for generating
primary active membrane potentials, which also includes the Ca2+-ATPase of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the Na+/K+-ATPase of mammalian cells. Specifically, AHAs link ATP catalysis to the active transport of
protons out of the cell, thereby establishing a transmembrane proton
motive force (PMF) that drives many secondary transport processes.− The PMF is composed of both a pH gradient and an electrical membrane
potential that can reach in excess of −250 mV in roots. AHAs are highly expressed in cell types specialized
for active transport, including phloem tissue, guard cells, and epidermal
root hairs, and are major consumers of cellular ATP.,−

Of the 11 genes encoding functional proteins, AHA1 and AHA2 are the two most highly expressed
isoforms,
are abundant in all tissues and developmental stages based on EST
expression data, and are estimated to make up to 80% of all AHA activity.,, The plasma membrane proton pumps
are hypothesized to play roles in the control of tip growth by generating
localized proton fluxes, and are highly regulated
to control guard cell opening and closure in response to biotic and
abiotic stimuli.− Using reverse-genetic analysis, roles for AHA3 in pollen development,
AHA4 in salt stress, and AHA10 in proanthocyanidin and vacuole biosynthesis
have been reported.− However, the essential, yet genetically redundant,
nature of AHA1 and AHA2 has complicated
reverse-genetic approaches to elucidate specific cellular functions
for these two proteins. To create a more
facile system for investigating AHA1 specific functions, we developed
transgenic endogenous double aha1/aha2 knockdown lines rescued with a tandem affinity-purification (TAP)-tagged
AHA1, thereby replacing ∼70% of the AHA protein in crude seedling
and vegetative extracts with a fusion protein capable of facilitating
isoform-specific methods including purification, biochemical analysis,
and mass spectrometry.

An increasing interest in defining protein-interaction
networks
has been greatly facilitated by emerging proteomic, genomic, and imaging
technologies.− An especially significant contribution to the identification
of protein interactions is the growing access to modern mass spectrometry
(MS) resources and the ability to perform quantitative experiments. Recently, two large Arabidopsis protein-interaction networks have been published including a yeast
two-hybrid approach that identified 6200 interactions among 2700 proteins and a split ubiquitin approach focused on membrane
proteins that revealed 541 interactions between 239 proteins. No AHA1 or AHA2 protein interactions were identified
in the yeast two-hybrid interactome database, and only two high-confidence
candidates, both annotated as leucine-rich repeat kinases, were generated
by the split ubiquitin approach. Furthermore, proteins previously
published to interact with the plasma membrane proton pumps were not
identified in these interactome studies.−,,,

Affinity purification of epitope-tagged proteins combined
with
mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis has become a widely established
method for the characterization of protein complexes, and tandem affinity-purification
tags have been successfully used to investigate protein complexes
in plants via these affinity-purification mass spectrometry (AP–MS)
approaches.−, Affinity-purification mass spectrometry
methods have also been combined with chemical cross-linking for the
purification of low-abundance plasma membrane protein complexes from
plants.

Herein, we report the functional
rescue of aha1/aha2 double-knockout
plants with a TAP-tagged AHA1 genomic transgene (Ntapi:gAHA1). We
observed reduced vertical root growth in Ntapi:gAHA1 transgenic rescue lines, but no other phenotypic consequences in
overall plant growth was apparent under standard laboratory growth
conditions. To investigate the basis of the short-root phenotype and
to assess the validity of using these plants for future AHA1 functional
studies, we used a metabolically labeled mass spectrometry approach
to characterize proteins showing increased or decreased abundance
in Ntapi:gAHA1 compared to wild-type plants. We used
affinity purification followed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify
AHA1-interacting protein candidates by Ntapi:AHA1 copurification and
investigated the effect of in vivo elicitation on copurifying proteins.
The Ntapi:gAHA1 transgenic plants reported here will
provide an important tool for AHA1 isoform-specific biochemical analysis,
identification of new protein interactions, and verification of interactions
previously identified using heterologous techniques.

Experimental
Procedures
Plant Materials and Growth Conditions
Mutants (ecotype
Columbia) carrying homozygous T-DNA insertions in AHA1 (aha1–6, SALK016325) and heterozygous insertions
in AHA2 (aha2–4, SALK082786) were created by crossing as described previously. Seeds were germinated on plates containing half-strength
Murashige &amp; Skoog (M&amp;S) salts, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.7%
(w/v) agar. Seedlings were transferred to soil/perlite mixture and
grown under constant light at 21 °C.

Root Growth Assays
Root growth asssays were conducted
as described previously.,

DNA Extraction and Plant
Genotyping
Plant genomic DNA
was extracted using the method of Krysan et al. with the elimination
of the phenol/chloroform step. The presence
of aha1–6 and aha2–4 T-DNA insertion or wild-type alleles was determined by
PCR using allele-specific primers spanning the T-DNA and AHA1 or AHA2 genomic junctions (T-DNA LB: TCAAACAGGATTTTCGCCTGCT;
S016325 LP: CGTCTCAACAAAAGTCTCTTTCA; S016325 RP:
CGAAAGATCAACCTCGTGAGT; S082786 LP: ATGTTCATTGCAAAGGTGGTG;
and S082786 RP: CCCATTAGCTCGTGGTTATTG).

Cloning and Transformation of TAP-Tagged
AHA1
Cloning
of a 9.9 kb genomic region containing AHA1 with 3377
bp of upstream and 1100 bp of downstream DNA (gAHA1) was described previously. A unique SalI restriction-enzyme site was created at the 5′
end of the AHA1 open reading frame using the QuikChange
II XL kit (Stratagene) and the following mutagenic primers:

Forward: GATTTCTTCTGGGTGAAGATGTCGACTCTCGAAGATATCAAGAACGAGA

Reverse: TCTCGTTCTTGATATCTTCGAGAGTCGACATCTTCACCCAGAAGAAATC

The gAHA1 fragment was subcloned into the Agrobacterium transformation vector pGreenII0179 at the SacI and XhoI sites. The N-terminal TAPi tag was amplified with a high-fidelity
polymerase from the gateway cloning vector ntapi.289.gw using the following primers designed to append SalI restriction overhangs:

Forward: AAGTCGACCGTGGTGGACAACAAGTTCAA

Reverse: TTGTCGACGAAGAAGATCCTCCTCCTCCCAGTGCGCCGCTG

Adenosine overhangs were added with Taq polymerase, and the fragment
was cloned into pCR2.1. Ntapi SalI restriction fragments
were cloned into the unique AHA1 SalI site. Constructs
were confirmed by sequencing and used to transform aha1–6/aha1–6;AHA2/aha2–4 plants via Agrobacterium-mediated
floral dip, strain GV3101 carrying pSOUP. Transgenic seeds were selected on hygromycin media (half-strength
M&amp;S, 1% sucrose, 0.7% agar, and 25 μg/mL of hygromycin).
Hygromycin-resistant (HygR) aha1/aha1;aha2/aha2 plants
complemented by the presence of the N-terminal Ntapi:gAHA1 construct were isolated in the T2 population by PCR genotyping.

Plasma Membrane Preparation
Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 9 days in half-strength M&amp;S liquid
media as described previously. Nine day
old seedlings were extracted in 2× (v/w) homogenization buffer
(230 mM sorbitol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM potassium
metabisulfite, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
1 mM ammonium molybdate, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche)). Microsomes were collected as previously described. The microsomal pellet was resuspended in resuspension
buffer (330 mM sorbitol, 5 mM KCl, and 5 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.8) and homogenized in a Teflon homogenizer, and plasma membranes
were enriched by phase partition as described previously. Protein concentrations were determined with
Bradford assays.

Protein Purification
Plasma membrane
protein (100–500
μg) was solubilized with 10:1 (w/w) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in resuspension buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Unsolubilized
material was pelleted in a benchtop microcentrifuge at full speed
for 30 min at 4 °C. Solubilized upper-phase protein (0.1 mg,
100–200 μL total volume) was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C
with 15 μL of rabbit IgG agarose resin (Sigma, A9294) or 10
μL of IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Life Sciences, 17-0969-01)
equilibrated in resuspension buffer with 0.1% (w/v) DDM. Resin was
pelleted at 0.8 rcf for 1 min, and supernatant was discarded. Resin
was washed two times at 4 °C for 10 min with a 100× volume
of resuspension buffer containing 1% NP40 followed by a final wash
in a 100× volume of resuspension buffer containing 1% NP40 and
0.01% SDS. Resin was pelleted for 1 min at 0.8 rcf between each wash,
and supernatant was discarded. Protein was eluted overnight at 4 °C
with 30 units AcTEV protease (Invitrogen).

SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE
analysis was performed on Novex 10%
Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) using 1× Novex Tris-Glycine SDS
running buffer or on NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels using 1×
MOPS running buffer at 80 V for 3 to 4 h. Protein samples were diluted
1:1 in Laemmli sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol (BioRad).
For western blot, gels were incubated at room temperature for 20 min
in 100 mL of equilibration buffer (2× NuPAGE transfer buffer,
10% methanol, and 1:1000 NuPAGE antioxidant). Proteins were transferred
to PVDF using the iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen) using program
P3 for 12 min. Immunoblotting was performed according standard protocols
using HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG for colorometric visualization
or rabbit anti-CBP (Calmodulin-binding protein, Genscript) followed
by IRDye goat anti-rabbit (LI-COR) for membranes visualized with a
LI-COR Odyssey infrared scanner.

Blue Native PAGE
Three micrograms of plasma membrane
protein was combined with 1% digitonin in membrane-solubilization
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) as previously
described. NativePAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen)
was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1×,
and NativePAGE 5% G-250 sample additive was added to a final concentration
of 0.06%. Samples were run on NativePAGE Novex 3–12% Bis-Tris
gels at 150 V for 20 min with dark blue cathode buffer followed by
45 min with light blue cathode buffer. Gels were washed for 20 min
in equilibration buffer (80 mL of ddH20, 10 mL of 20×
transfer buffer, 10 mL of methanol, and 100 μL of NuPage antioxidant),
transferred to Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore) using an iBlot dry
blotting system (Invitrogen). Membrane was allowed to dry 30 min.
Immunoblotting was performed according to a standard protocol using
rabbit anti-CBP and IRDye goat anti-rabbit (LI-COR). Membranes were
visualized with a LI-COR Odyssey infrared-imaging system.

Metabolic Labeling
and Mass Spectrometry
Seedlings
for metabolically labeled mass spectrometry experiments were grown
in 1× M&amp;S micronutrient solution supplemented with 1.5 mM
CaCl2, 0.75 mM MgSO4, 0.625 mM KH2PO4, 2.3 mM MES salts, and 29.2 mM sucrose. Natural abundance
(14N) or heavy (15N) NH4NO3 ( 0.825 g) and 14N or 15N KNO3 (0.96
g) were added to 1 L of media, and the pH was adjusted to 5.7 with
KOH. Fourteen milligrams of seeds was grown in 75 mL of sterile media
supplemented with ampicillin. Seeds were stratified in the dark for
2 nights at 4 °C and then grown under constant light with gentle
shaking for 9 days. Seedlings were spun-dry and weighed, and equal
fresh weights of heavy and light seedlings were combined. Microsome
and plasma membrane purification proceeded as above. Methanol/chloroform
extraction was performed on plasma membrane and soluble fractions
as previously described. Protein was
suspended in 8 M urea/50 mM NH4HCO3 with gentle
sonication and diluted to 1 M urea using 50 mM NH4HCO3. A BCA protein assay was performed to determine protein concentration.
Aliquots of samples were reduced with 5 mM DTT at ∼50 °C
for 45 min, alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature
for 45 min, and digested overnight at 37 °C with a 50:50 mixture
of trypsin/lys-C (total protein/enzyme ratio 100:1). Samples were
acidified with 0.3% TFA and desalted using Waters tC18 sep-pak columns
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After drying
the samples, peptides were solubilized in LC–MS quality 0.1%
formic acid. Approximately 5 μg of samples was loaded for analysis
using an Agilent 1100 LC system inline with an LTQ Orbitrap XL. Peptides
were separated over an in-house packed reversed-phase analytical column
(Magic-C18, 200 Å, 3 μm, Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) with
a postloading mobile phase elution gradient of 0–40% B over
3 h (A, 0.1% formic acid; B, 95% CH3CN and 0.1% formic
acid) at 200 nL/min. Data-dependent analysis was performed in the
LTQ Orbitrap XL using FTMS preview mode and full MS scan acquisition at 100 000 resolving power. The
top five ions, excluding unassigned and +1 charge states, were repeatedly
isolated with a 2.5 Da window for CID analysis in the linear ion trap
using a normalized collision energy of 35.0 and activation Q and time
of 0.25 and 30 ms, respectively. Dynamic exclusion was used for 40
s with a repeat count of 1 throughout the duration of analysis. The
TAIR9 proteome database was searched using Mascot v2.2, allowing one
missed tryptic cleavage, +2 and +3 charge states, a peptide tolerance
of 20 ppm, and MS/MS ion tolerance of 0.6 Da. Carbamidomethylation
was set as a fixed modification, and phosphorylated S/T/Y, deamidated
N/Q, and oxidated M were set as variable modifications. A reverse
database was appended and concurrently searched. Data was filtered
to a 1% false discovery rate using in-house developed software (available
at http://www.biotech.wisc.edu/sussmanlab/home), and ratio calculations were performed using Census. Every sample was manually median-normalized
prior to analysis.

Quantitative Analysis of Metabolically Labeled
Proteomes
Peptides with Mascot scores below 30 or peak correlations
below 0.8
were discarded from analysis. Peptide ratios were averaged to achieve
a single ratio for every protein identified. Proteins showing 14N/15N and reciprocal ratios of ≥1.2 or
≤0.8 identified in each experimental pair were subjected to
manual verification. Peptides were blasted against the TAIR10 protein
database (www.arabidopsis.org) to determine uniqueness, and nonunique peptides were discarded.
Reciprocal protein ratios for proteins identified by three or more
peptides in 14N/15N and 15N/14N tissue pairs were tested for statistical significance using
a two-sample, two-tailed student’s t test
with p ≤ 0.05. Protein-abundance changes were
strengthened when the protein was identified in both biological replicates
and the direction of change in both replicates agreed. Proteins showing
opposite abundance changes in reciprocal pairs were discarded.

Mass
Spectrometry of IgG-Purified Proteins
IgG-purified,
TEV-eluted protein samples were TCA/acetone-precipitated, and pellets
were suspended in 7.4 μL of 8 M urea, 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5), and 1 mM Tris-HCl for 5 min and subsequently diluted
to 30 μL with 1.25 μL of 25 mM DTT, 2.5 μL MeOH,
18.75 μL of 25 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) for
reduction and alkylation. Samples were incubated at 50 °C for
15 min and cooled on ice to room temperature. IAA (1.5 μL of
55 mM) was added, and samples were incubated at room temperature in
the dark for 15 min. The reaction was quenched with 4 μL of
25 mM DTT. Eight microliters of trypsin (10 ng/μL Trypsin Gold,
Promega Corp., in 25 mM NH4HCO3) and 6.5 μL
of 25 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 8.5) was added to a final
volume of 50 μL. Digestion proceeded for 2 h at 42 °C followed
by an additional 5 μL of trypsin for a final enzyme/substrate
ratio of 1:40. Digestion proceeded overnight at 37 °C. Digestions
were quenched with 2.5% TFA to 0.3% final concentration, and 8 μL
(∼700 ng) was loaded for nanoLC–MS/MS analysis. Microsomal
and two-phase plasma membrane-enriched fractions were delipidated
with methanol/chloroform separation prior to digestion. One-hundred
micrograms of microsomal protein and 10 μg of plasma membrane-enriched
fractions were precipitated in methanol/chloroform/water (4:1:1),
and the protein pellet at the organic and aqueous interphase was washed
in neat methanol. The protein was dried then digested as above in
a 100 μL total volume with a 1:40 ratio of trypsin/substrate.
Peptides were analyzed by nanoLC–MS/MS using the Agilent 1100
nanoflow system (Agilent Technologies) connected to a linear hybrid
ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap XL, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. HPLC was
performed on in in-house fabricated 15 cm C18 column packed with MAGIC
C18AQ 3 μm particles (Michrom BioResources, Inc.) in a laser-pulled
tip (P-2000, Sutter Instrument) using 360 μm × 75 μm
fused silica tubing. Sample loading and desalting were done at 15
μL/min using a trapping column in line with the autosampler
(Zorbax 300SB-C18, 5 μM, 5 × 0.3 mm, Agilent Technologies).
Peptide elution solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent
B was 0.1% formic acid and 95% acetonitrile in water. The flow rate
was 200 nL/min. The column was loaded, desalted, and equilibrated
for 20 min in 1% solvent B followed by an increase to 40% solvent
B over 195 min, ramped to 60% solvent B over 20 min, increased to
100% solvent B in 5 min, and held at 100% solvent B for an additional
3 min. The column was re-equilibrated to 1% B for 30 min. MS/MS data
acquisition was gathered in a data-dependent mode as follows: MS survey
scans from m/z 300 to 2000 were
collected in centroid mode at a resolving power of 100 000.
MS/MS spectra were collected on the five most abundant signals in
each survey scan. Dynamic exclusion for 40 s of precursors up to 0.55 m/z below and 1.05 m/z above previously selected precursors was employed to increase
the dynamic range and to maximize peptide identifications. Singly
charged ions and ions for which the charge state could not be assigned
were rejected from consideration for MS/MS.

Quantitative Analysis
Label-free raw data files were
converted to Mascot generic format (mgf) through initial open-source
mzXML format conversion using the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) software
suite version 4.4. Mgf files were searched against the Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR9 database with decoy reverse
entries and common contaminants were included for a total of 27 279 Arabidopsis protein-coding genes and 62 523
total entries using in-house Mascot search engine 2.2.07 (Matrix Science)
with variable methionine oxidation and asparagine and glutamine deamidation.
Peptide mass tolerance was set at 20 ppm with fragment mass at 0.8
Da. Protein annotations, identification significance, and spectral-based
quantification were done using Scaffold software (version 3.6.3, Proteome
Software Inc., Portland, OR.) Protein identifications were accepted
if they were established with greater than 95% probability and contained
at least two peptides using a 1% false discovery rate. Protein probabilities
were assigned using Protein Prophet. Proteins
containing nonunique peptides that could not be assigned on MS/MS
analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony.
Metabolically labeled raw data was acquired, converted, and searched
as above. Mascot search results were transformed to pepXML format
using TPP software with an in-house-generated false-discovery-rate
filter. FDR for peptide identification was set at 10% for for low-quality
MS/MS spectra to be allowed and available for manual inspection if
desired. Relative quantification of 14N/15N
peptide ratios was performed using TPP tools and Census software (Scripps
Research Institute).

Results
Complementation with a
TAP-Tagged AHA1 Transgene
Our lab has previously
shown that wild-type AHA1 or AHA2 transgenes successfully rescue aha1/aha1;aha2/aha2 double-knockdown embryo
lethality. We therefore wished to test
whether an AHA1 transgene fused to a tandem affinity-purification
(TAP) tag could
also rescue embryonic lethality. A TAP-tag construct optimized for
use in plants containing two tandem protein A domains separated from
a calmodulin-binding protein domain (CBP) by a TEV protease site was
ligated to the 5′ end of a genomic AHA1 open
reading frame ().

Arabidopsis (Col-0, aha1/aha1;AHA2/aha2) were transformed with the Ntapi:gAHA1 clone via Agrobacterium-mediated
floral dip, and successful transformation events were selected on
hygromycin media., Plants were allowed to self,
and PCR genotyping of the T2 population identified aha1/aha1;aha2/aha2 double-knockdown plants carrying the Ntapi:gAHA1 transgene. We recovered two independent rescue lines expressing Ntapi:gAHA1 (Ntapi:gAHA1a and Ntapi:gAHA1b; TAPa and TAPb). A band of approximately 125 kDa was detected in
western blots from denaturing SDS protein gels of Ntapi:gAHA1 microsomal fractions probed for protein A. Following two-phase partitioning,
the majority of protein A staining enriches in the plasma membrane
phase (Figure ). In addition to the major
band between the 110 and 130 kDa markers, we commonly observe the
slightly higher and smaller ∼70–80 kDa bands on western
blots. Smaller bands may be due to partial proteolysis of the C-terminal
regulatory domain, whereas larger bands may be due to alterred migration
resulting from bound lipid or detergent molecules. 

Previous
studies of the Nicotiana plumbaginifolia plasma membrane proton pump, PMA2, indicate that the protein is
present in the membrane as hexameric complexes, especially after activation
by fusicoccin and subsequent 14-3-3 protein binding., To determine the molecular weight of nondenatured Ntapi:AHA1, purified
plasma membranes were run on blue native gels and probed with rabbit
anti-CBP antibody. We observed two bands migrating close to the 242
and 720 kDa markers. Proteins may migrate higher than expected in
blue native gels based on detergents and dyes used or bound lipids;
thus, these bands likely correspond to dimeric and hexameric complexes
observed previously (Figure ).

Upper panel is coomassie stained, and lower panel is a western blot
probed with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG.

Three micrograms of Ntapi:gAHA1 or wild-type plasma membrane protein
was run on blue native gels. Proteins were transferred to membranes
and probed with rabbit anti-CBP antibodies.

The efficiency of aha1/aha2 double-knockdown
rescue
by Ntapi:gAHA1 was assessed by comparing the genotypes
of aha1–6/aha1–6;AHA2/aha2–4;Ntapi:gAHA1a progeny to the ratios expected on
the basis of Mendelian segregation for either a single or two unlinked
insertional events (Table ). The presence
of multiple insertions and complex transgenic loci following Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is common., Progeny ratios differed significantly from both expected scenarios
based on chi-squared analysis but more closely resembled a scenario
involving two unlinked transgene insertional events. A reduction in
the number of rescued progeny from the expected number was observed
and could be due to altered expression, translation, trafficking,
or biochemical activity of the fusion protein. A similar segregation
analysis of Ntapi:gAHA1b progeny was not performed
because the genotype of the transformed seedling was aha1–6;aha1–6/aha2–4;aha2–4.

Ntapi:gAHA1 Plants Exhibit Reduced Root Length
When grown vertically
on standard half-strength M&amp;S with 1%
(w/v) sucrose nutrient media, we observed approximately 20% reduced
root length in Ntapi:gAHA1 plants compared to wild-type
or aha1/aha2 double knockdown mutants rescued with
a wild-type AHA1 transgene (gAHA1) (Figure A). We looked for additional growth changes such
as the time to first bolting (Figure B) and
plant growth in soil (Figure C), but we did
not observe readily apparent differences. Work in our lab has previously
shown that aha2 single-knockdown mutants exhibit
root-growth phenotypes when seedlings are grown under stress conditions
(high external pH, high external potassium, and toxic cations) that
alter or rely on the proton motive force., To determine effects of the TAP-tagged AHA1 protein on the proton
motive force, we grew Ntapi:gAHA1 plants in the presence
of gentamicin and lithium chloride. Under these conditions, aha2 knockdowns show enhanced root growth compared to wild-type
plants because of the reduced proton motive force that energizes the
reduced uptake of these toxic compounds. Ntapi:gAHA1 lines show similar root-growth phenotypes to aha2 single knockdowns rescued with a gAHA1 transgene
(Figure D).

growth (mm) of plants on half-strength M&amp;S with 1% (w/v) sucrose

to determine statistical difference (p &lt; 0.005, n ≥ 12). (B) Sixteen seedling of each genotype were

Proteome Analysis of Ntapi:gAHA1 Plants
With the ultimate goal of using Ntapi:gAHA1 plants
for the in planta physiological investigation of AHA1, we wished to
establish how closely transgenic lines resembled wild-type plants
beyond merely visible phenotypes. To this end, we compared the plasma
membrane and soluble proteomes of Ntapi:gAHA1 plants
to wild-type and gAHA1 rescue lines using a metabolically
labeled mass spectrometry approach to determine whether expressing Ntapi:AHA1 had proteomic consequences. Equal wet weights
of seedlings grown in natural-abundance (14N) and isotopically
heavy nitrogen (15N) liquid media were mixed prior to protein
extraction. Subsequent downstream sample processing and mass spectrometry
analysis was identical for paired tissues, and the relative abundance
of a peptide from the original tissue can be determined by calculating
the ratio of 14N/15N peptide intensity. A ratio of 1.0 indicates no difference in peptide
abundance between metabolically labeled tissue pairs; a ratio greater
than 1.0 indicates increased peptide abundance from 14N-grown
tissue compared to 15N-grown tissue; and a ratio less than
1.0 indicates decreased peptide abundance in 14N-grown
tissue

We generated 14N/15N and reciprocal 15N/14N tissue pairs of liquid-grown, 9 day old
wild-type/wild-type, wild-type/gAHA1, and wild-type/Ntapi:gAHA1a plants and performed biological duplicates
for each experimental pair. Proteomic analysis of both soluble and
plasma membrane proteomes was performed. The number of unique peptides
and proteins identified by tandem mass spectrometry from each metabolically
labeled tissue pair is summarized in . Approximately half of the protein
identifications in all samples were based on a single peptide and
were discarded from further analysis (). For proteins identified by more than
one peptide, peptide ratios were averaged to achieve a single 14N/15N protein ratio. Protein ratios for plasma
membrane (Figure ) and soluble (Figure ) fractions were plotted as the ratios from 14N/15N to reciprocal 15N/14N genotype pairs.

calculated by averaging median-normalized peptide ratios determined
by Census, with a minimum MASCOT score of 30. Calculated protein ratios
for reciprocally labeled tissue pairs were plotted for proteins identified
by two or more peptides in both samples. The number of proteins showing
reciprocal ratios of ≥1.2 and ≤0.8 in each sample are
indicated.

Following manual verification
of proteins showing 14N/15N and reciprocal ratios
of ≥1.2 or ≤0.8,
no proteins met all of the required criteria (see ) in 14Nwild-type/15Nwild-type and reciprocal plasma membrane or soluble protein fractions.
In wild-type/gAHA1 tissue pairs, only AHA1 itself
showed statistically significant and reciprocal abundance changes
in both biological replicates (Table ). Despite
the reduced levels of AHA1 protein at the membrane, gAHA1-rescue lines show no observable phenotypes under standard laboratory
growth conditions. In wild-type/Ntapi:gAHA1 tissue
pairs, we identified nine plasma membrane proteins that were differentially
abundant in all three reciprocal experiments with at least a 20% abundance
change in one experiment (Table ). The majority
of proteins identified show decreased abundance in Ntapi:gAHA1 seedlings compared to wild-type, but two, the phosphate transporter
ATPT2 and AHA1 itself, show increased abundance. The known cellular
roles of identified proteins include membrane transport (ATPT2), cell
wall structure (SVL2), vesicle trafficking (PATL1), and microtubule
structure and organization (DREPP).−

TAP-Tag-Mediated Purification
of AHA1
With the goal
of using Ntapi:gAHA1 plants to facilitate efficient
isoform-specific purification of AHA1 from Arabidopsis tissue, we investigated the ability to specifically purify Ntapi:AHA1
with IgG purification resin. We developed a modified tandem affinity-purification
protocol to purify Ntapi:AHA1 using only the first affinity-purification
step to limit the possibility of losing protein interactors with increased
sample handling. Purification of Ntapi:AHA1
from plasma membrane fractions by IgG resin is demonstrated by western
blot in Figure . Including 0.1% SDS in the
IgG resin washing buffer decreases nonspecifically bound proteins
while retaining high Ntapi:AHA1 antibody reactivity in eluted fractions.
Using normalized spectral counts as a relative quantification of the
abundance of Ntapi:AHA1 in membrane and purified samples, the protein
enrichment from upper-phase fractions by IgG resin is approximately
3.5-fold under mild washing conditions (Table ). Addition of 150 mM NaCl further reduces MS identification of contaminating
proteins but also results in loss of Ntapi:AHA1 staining in western
blots of TEV-eluted fractions (). We therefore routinely use washing conditions containing
0.1% SDS with no additional salts for reducing background protein
contamination while retaining specifically bound Ntapi:AHA1.

Purification
of Ntapi:AHA1 visulized by western blot. One-hundred
micrograms of solubilized plasma membrane protein was incubated with
IgG purification resin, washed three times with 0.1% SDS in resuspension
buffer followed by three times with AcTEV, and eluted overnight with
AcTEV protease. Eluted proteins were acetone-precipitated and resuspended
directly in Laemmli sample buffer with reducing agent. One microgram
of nonplasma membrane (non-PM) and plasma membrane (PM) wild-type
or Ntapi:gAHA1 protein and half of TEV-eluted proteins were loaded
on 4–12% NuPAGE gels. The left panel is silver stained for
total protein, and the right panel is a western blot probed with rabbit
anti-CBP followed by LI-COR IRDye goat anti-rabbit antibody. Size-marker
values are in kDa.

Identification
of Ntapi:AHA1-Copurifying Proteins
After
establishing specific IgG purification of Ntapi:AHA1, we pursued the
identification of Ntapi:AHA1-copurifying proteins using an affinity-purification
mass spectrometry approach. Ntapi:gAHA1 and wild-type
plants were grown in 14N and 15N liquid media
and combined prior to homogenization as described previously. More
than three technical purification replicates were performed on 14NNtapi:gAHA1/15Nwild-type and
reciprocal 14Nwild-type/15NNtapi:gAHA1 tissue pairs. Eluted proteins were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry
analysis, and proteins showing reciprocal 14N/15N ratios deviating from 1.0 between wild-type and Ntapi:gAHA1 seedlings were subjected to manual analysis. Four proteins showed
increased purification from Ntapi:gAHA1 plants compared
to wild-type including two additional AHA isoforms (Table ). The enrichment of AHA9 and AHA11 from Ntapi:gAHA1 versus wild-type protein extracts was validated
by searching the raw data for peaks corresponding to unique peptides
from each isoform (Figure ). Because of the
high degree of sequence identity between isoforms, many other AHA
peptides were discarded from our analysis; however, a list of all
identified AHA peptides and their 14N/15N ratios
are included in the  ().

Peptides unique to other
AHA isoforms enrich with Ntapi:AHA1 after
TAP-tag-mediated purification. Metabolically labeled 14NNtapi:gAHA1/15Nwild-type (red) and reciprocal 14Nwild-type/15NNtapi:gAHA1 (blue)
plasma membrane pairs were incubated with IgG resin, washed, and eluted
overnight with TEV protease. The raw data was inspected manually for
peaks corresponding to the indicated unique peptides from AHA1, AHA9,
and AHA11.

Response of Ntapi:AHA1-Copurifying Proteins to in Vivo Treatment
Because of the autoinhibited state of AHA proteins, we wished to investigate whether treatment in vivo with compounds known or hypothesized to cause AHA
activation would effect identification of NTapi:AHA1-copurifying
proteins. The fungal phytotoxin fusicoccin (FC) binds to and stabilizes
the AHA phosphorylated C-terminus and 14-3-3 protein complex, causing
permanent activation of the pump. We
hypothesized that treating liquid-grown seedlings with FC would increase
mass spectrometry identification of 14-3-3 proteins in IgG-purified
eluates, which we failed to identify in nonelicited copurification
experiments (). Nine day old Ntapi:gAHA1 liquid-grown 14N + FC/15N – FC and reciprocally treated pairs
were subjected to combined homogenization, purification, and MS analysis
as previously described. Treatment of seedlings with 1 μM FC
for 30 min increased purification of AHA11 and several 14-3-3 protein
isoforms including GRF1, GRF2, and GRF3 (Table ). Auxin also regulates plasma membrane proton pump activity by phosphorylation,
although the protein kinases and/or phosphotases responsible have
not been identified. Additionally, the
inhibitory effect of auxin on root growth is well-established and
likely involves regulation of proton pump activity. When seedlings were treated with 1 μM indole-3-acetic-acid
for 15 min, we observed decreased copurification of the protein kinase
PHOT1 (Table ).

Discussion
Herein,
we describe the functional rescue of aha1/aha2 knockdown embryonic lethality in Arabidopsis by stable transformation with an N-terminal
TAP-tagged genomic AHA1 transgene, and we used an affinity-purification
mass spectrometry approach to copurify candidate Ntapi:AHA1-interacting
proteins. The ability to identify proteins interacting with AHA1 in planta is a particular strength of our approach that
is not feasible with heterologous methods used to identify protein
interactions, including the yeast two-hybrid and split ubiquitin systems.

While we observed a slight reduction in the number of endogenous
double knockdown, transgene-rescued progeny from the expected numbers
based on Mendelian segregation, this could be a result of non-WT transgene
expression or altered translation, trafficking, or activity of the
tagged protein, resulting in some amount of embryonic lethality. Western
blots of two-phase separated membranes showed that Ntapi:AHA1 was
enriched with plasma membrane fractions compared to nonplasma membrane
fractions, as expected. This result alleviated concerns that the TAP
tag could be deleteriously affecting proper maturation and trafficking
of Ntapi:AHA1 protein, although we cannot rule out the possibility
that a portion of the protein may be mistrafficked or misfolded.

Ntapi:gAHA1-rescue lines exhibited minimal observable
phenotypic consequences beyond the ∼20% reduced vertical root
growth on standard media. However, mass spectrometry revealed a subtle
plasma membrane proteomic phenotype of Ntapi:gAHA1 plants. Several proteins showing abundance differences in Ntapi:gAHA1 versus wild-type plants have reported roles
in cell wall structure, vesicle trafficking, and cell elongation,
and these proteins could be contributing factors to the observed Ntapi:gAHA1 short-root phenotype. SVL2 is related to the
plasma membrane anchored, glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase
protein SHV3. SHV3 plays a role in cell wall rigidity, and knockout
mutants exhibit ruptured root hairs and swollen guard cells. PATL1 is expressed in root tip cells and plays
an important role in membrane trafficking and cell plate maturation,
both important processes for cell elongation.,, AtPrx34 is a known cell wall associated
peroxidase expressed in root cells that plays a role in cell elongation.
Knockout lines of a closely related gene, AtPrx33, have short roots, and double knockouts exhibit an additive effect. The DREPP family protein identified in our study,
PcaP1, has microtubule destabilizing activity that results in the
negative regulation of hypotcotyl elongation. A closely related gene, PcaP2, negatively regulates
root hair tip growth. These two proteins
bind to Ca2+/calmodulin complexes; therefore, our Ntapi:AHA1 construct may be interefereing with normal regulation
and activity of this protein with respect to calmodulin binding. Together,
the altered abundance of these proteins in Ntapi:gAHA1 seedlings may be contributing to reduced vertical root growth. It
is also possible that other tip growing systems may be affected. For
example, if pollen tube growth of endogenous knockout pollen carrying
the Ntapi:gAHA1 transgene is also negatively affected,
it may explain the reduced numbers of Ntapi:gAHA1 rescue progeny we observed.

Because of the essential nature
of AHA1 and AHA2 and the number
of important plant processes in which they are hypothesized to function,
we hypothesize that many interacting proteins, including protein kinases
important in the regulation of AHA by phosphorylation at multiple
sites in the C-terminal regulatory region, are yet to be identified. Initial experimentation to identify Ntapi:AHA1-interacting
proteins identified two additional copurifying AHA isoforms, AHA9
and AHA11. We and others have shown that AHA proteins form multimeric
complexes in plasma membranes, but whether those complexes are homomultimeric
or heteromultimeric with respect to isoform composition has not been
shown. Our copurification results suggest that these complexes are
mixed in their isoform composition and further opens the possibility
that the isoform composition of native AHA complexes could play important
regulatory or signaling roles. These
results are in contrast to a recent publication by Bobik et al., which
showed that Nicotiana plumbaginifolia H+-ATPase isoforms PMA2 and PMA4 did not oligomerize
with each other. The different results
may be due to differences in experimental design, including the use
of natural versus overexpression promoters or differences in the biological
activity of H+-ATPase isoforms from Arabidopsis versus Nicotiana. We also observed increased copurification of AHA11 after treatment
with the fungal toxin FC, suggesting that the isoform composition
of quaternary AHA complexes may be constantly in flux and responsive
to the environment. One obvious limitation is that our rescue plants
do not express AHA2, which, because of its high expression levels
and shared sequence identity with AHA1, we would predict to be the
most common isoform to complex with AHA1. In the absence of AHA2,
other isoforms may be artifactually incorporating into multimeric
AHA complexes.

The autoinhibited state of AHA1 may reduce our
ability to identify
interacting proteins. We therefore tested if we could expand the identification
of copurifying proteins by combining in vivo treatments that are hypothesized
or known to regulate AHA activity with metabolic labeling, affinity
purification, and mass spectrometry. The dynamic copurification of
PHOT1 and 14-3-3 in response to exogenous auxin or fusicoccin suggest
that further experiments will reveal similar, and potentially novel,
AHA1-interacting proteins in response to specific conditions. A current
limitation is the inability to discern whether proteins with differential
abundance in purified samples after in vivo elicitation reflect true
Ntapi:AHA1-interacting proteins or indicate changes in the abundance
of these proteins in plasma membrane fractions prior to purification
with IgG resin. We addressed this problem by also analyzing an aliquot
of unpurified plasma membrane samples with tandem mass spectormetry;
however, the increased sample complexity of nonpurified samples can
result in decreased peptide identification and inconclusive results,
especially for less abundant proteins. Introducing cross-linking reagents
to maintain protein interactions while increasing the denaturing quality
of washing steps to remove nonspecifically bound proteins from the
purification resin will facilitate the identification of interacting
proteins in the future.
