Although cannabinoids are active
at several G protein-coupled receptors and ion channels, only two
“true” cannabinoid receptors are recognized, namely
CB1 and CB2. Interest
in the latter has sparked as it appeared as an important therapeutic
target in inflammatory and painful conditions,, while
not being involved in the psychoactive cannabinoid effects, which
are mainly CB1-mediated. As such, increasing effort is
being spent in the development of CB2-based therapeutic
agents., Nonetheless, controversies exist, for instance,
in CB2 pharmacology and distribution.− At least two
CB2 receptor isoforms have been identified, with tissue-
and species-specific expression patterns., It
has been found that CB2 agonists may elicit distinct responses
at CB2 receptors from different species. Moreover, functional selectivity, defined as the ability
of a receptor to couple to different signaling pathways depending
on the ligand that stimulates it, has
been reported for CB2. Further
complexity is added to the CB2 receptor pharmacology with
the recent finding that their intracellular activation modulates neuronal
function. Because CB2 receptors
have been found to signal through Ca2+,− we used calcium imaging and extracellular
and intracellular administration of cannabinoid ligands to investigate
the functionality of plasmalemmal versus intracellular CB2 receptors in U2OS cells stably expressing CB2.

Experimental
Procedures
Chemicals
Anandamide, AM630, WIN55,212-2, 2-arachidonoyl
glycerol (2-AG), and d-[Trp7,9,10]-substance P were obtained
from Tocris Bioscience (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All other
chemicals were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).

Cell Culture
The
CB2-β-arrestin2-GFP-U2OS
(CB2-U2OS) cell line was kindly provided by M. Caron and
L. S. Barak (Duke University, Durham, NC); the CB2 receptor
sequence is the CNR2_Human sequence (GenBank accession code P34972). CB2-U2OS cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 mg/mL Zeocin, and 200 μg/mL G418 at
37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The serum
was removed 24 h prior to experimentation. In experiments that aimed
to evaluate Gq-dependent signaling, cell starvation was concomitant
with incubation of d-[Trp7,9,10]-substance P (24 h).

Immunocytochemistry
and Confocal Imaging Studies
U2OS
cells transiently transfected with the GFP-tagged CB2 receptor
(kindly provided by M. Caron and L. S. Barak) and with Rab7-RFP (Addgene,
Cambridge, MA) 48 h earlier were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed
in phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted with DAPI Fluoromont G (Southern
Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Cells were imaged using a Carl Zeiss 710
two-photon confocal microscope with a 63× oil immersion objective,
using a 1× digital zoom, with excitations set for DAPI, GFP,
and DsRed at 405, 488, and 561 nm, respectively. Images were analyzed
using Zen 2010 (Zeiss), as previously reported.

Calcium Imaging
Measurements of
[Ca2+]i were performed as previously described.− Briefly, cells were incubated
with 5 μM Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) in HBSS at room temperature
for 45 min, washed with dye-free HBSS, and incubated for an additional
45 min to allow dye de-esterification. Coverslips were mounted in
an open bath chamber (RP-40LP, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) on
the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TiE, Nikon Inc.,
Melville, NY), equipped with a Perfect Focus System and a Photometrics
CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). During the experiments,
the Perfect Focus System was activated. Fura-2 AM fluorescence (emission
at 510 nm), following alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm, was
acquired at a frequency of 0.25 Hz. Images were acquired and analyzed
using NIS-Elements AR version 3.1 (Nikon Inc.). After appropriate
calibration with ionomycin and CaCl2, and Ca2+-free and EGTA, respectively, the ratio of the fluorescence signals
(340 nm to 380 nm) was converted to Ca2+ concentration.

Intracellular Microinjection
Injections
were performed
using Femtotips II, InjectMan NI2, and FemtoJet systems (Eppendorf)
as previously reported.− Pipettes were backfilled with an intracellular solution
containing 110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) or the
compounds to be tested. The injection time was 0.4 s at 60 hectoPascal
with a compensation pressure of 20 hectoPascal to ensure that the
microinjected volume was &lt;1% of the cell volume. The intracellular
concentration of chemicals was determined on the basis of the concentration
in the pipet and the volume of injection. The cells to be injected
were Z-scanned before injection, and the cellular volume was automatically
calculated by NIS-Elements AR version 3.1 (Nikon Inc.).

Statistics
Data are expressed as means and the standard
error of the mean. One-way analysis of variance, followed by post
hoc Bonferroni and Tukey tests, was used to assess significant differences
between groups; P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Effects of Extracellular
versus Intracellular Administration
of CB2 Agonist 2-Arachidonoyl Glycerol on the Cytosolic
Ca2+ Concentration of CB2-Expressing U2OS Cells
We evaluated the Ca2+ response of U2OS cells stably
expressing the CB2 receptor to bath application and intracellular
microinjection of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG).
Increasing concentrations of 2-AG (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM) were
applied extracellularly to CB2-U2OS cells, which elevated
the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, by 7 ± 3.4 nM (n = 31 cells), 12 ±
5.1 nM (n = 43 cells), and 87 ± 3.1 nM (n = 56 cells), respectively (Figure A). The effect of the latter concentration of 2-AG was statistically
significant (P &lt; 0.05) and sensitive to CB2 blockade with AM630 (1 μM, 10 min). In the presence
of AM630, Δ[Ca2+]i was reduced to 14 ±
3.6 nM (n = 49) (Figure A,B).
The effect of 2-AG on [Ca2+]i was delayed by
1–2 min and increased gradually (Figure B).

Extracellular administration of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG)
to CB2-U2OS cells elevates [Ca2+]i. (A) Comparison of the increases in [Ca2+]i produced by extracellular administration of 2-AG (0.01–1
μM) and 1 μM 2-AG in the presence of CB2 receptor
antagonist AM630 (1 μM); P &lt; 0.05 compared
with basal levels (∗) or with 1 μM 2-AG (#). (B) Representative
recordings of increases in [Ca2+]i in response
to 1 μM 2-AG in absence or presence of 1 μM CB2 antagonist AM630.

In experiments using
the intracellular microinjection technique,
injection of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM 2-AG (final concentrations
inside the cell) induced robust and significant increases in [Ca2+]i of CB2-U2OS cells of 264 ±
11 nM (n = 6 cells), 653 ± 19 nM (n = 6 cells), and 938 ± 22 nM (n = 6 cells),
respectively, while control buffer microinjection had an insignificant
effect of 49 ± 4 nM (n = 6 cells) (Figure A–D). In the presence of co-injected CB2 antagonist AM630 (1 μM), 0.1 μM 2-AG elevated
[Ca2+]i by 58 ± 4 nM (n = 6 cells), similar to that of control buffer microinjection; the
effect of 0.1 μM 2-AG on [Ca2+]i of untransfected
U2OS cells was also insignificant, measuring 34 ± 5 nM (n = 6 cells) (Figure A,B,E,F).

bottom left) in CB2-U2OS cells, or microinjection of 0.1
μM 2-AG into control U2OS cells (bottom right). (B) Comparison

(middle), and 6 min after (right) intracellular administration of

0.1 μM 2-AG (F). Arrows denote the injected cells; the fluorescence
scale (0–3) is illustrated in each panel and magnified in the
left panel of part C.

In all series of experiments using intracellular injection,
CB2-U2OS cells were pretreated for 1 min with 1 μM
AM630
(applied extracellularly), to exclude the possibility that the injected
cannabinoid ligands leaked from the pipet and triggered plasma membrane
receptor-mediated effects.

Functional and Morphological Evidence of
Localization of CB2 to Endolysosomes in CB2-Transfected
U2OS Cells
CB2-U2OS cells were incubated
for 1 h with
either 1 μM bafilomycin A1, a V-type ATPase that prevents lysosomal
acidification, or 30 μM rapamycin,
which blocks the last step of the engulfment of molecules by endolysosomes
via microautophagy. Under the conditions
described above, the effect of 0.1 μM 2-AG on [Ca2+]i, initially measuring 653 ± 19 nM, was drastically
reduced to 36 ± 4.8 nM (n = 6 cells) and 67
± 9.1 nM (n = 6 cells) (Figure A–E). In U2OS cells co-expressing GFP-tagged CB2 receptors and RFP-tagged Rab7, a small GTPase associated
with both endosomes and lysosomes, we
observed an extensive colocalization of CB2 and Rab7 (Figure F). Lysosomal disruption using bafilomycin A1 greatly
reduced the extent of the merged signal of CB2 and Rab7
(Figure F).

or microautophagy inhibitor rapamycin (30 μM, incubation for
1 h, right). (B) Comparison of the increases in [Ca2+]i elicited by 2-AG under the conditions described above; P &lt; 0.05 when compared with 2-AG microinjection (∗).

CB2 receptor and RFP-tagged Rab7, an endolysosomal marker,

bafilomycin A1 markedly reduces the extent of the merged immunostaining
of CB2 and Rab7.

Intracellular, but Not Extracellular, Administration of Anandamide
Elevates the Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentration of CB2-Expressing U2OS Cells
CB2-U2OS cells extracellularly
treated with progressive concentrations of anandamide (0.01, 0.1,
and 1 μM) failed to respond with a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Figure 1 of the ); incubation with CB2 antagonist AM630
(1 μM) did not modify the response to 1 μM anandamide
(Figure 1 of the ).

However, CB2-U2OS cells responded to intracellular
administration of anandamide (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM, final concentrations
inside the cell) with significant and concentration-dependent elevations
of [Ca2+]i: 124 ± 7.4, 368 ± 8.4,
and 574 ± 7.2 nM, respectively [n = 6 cells
for each concentration tested (Figure A,B)].
The anandamide-induced increase in [Ca2+]i was
fast and transient (Figure A); blockade of
intracellular CB2 receptors upon co-injection of 1 μM
AM630 prevented the effect of microinjected anandamide (1 μM),
reducing it to 37 ± 4.1 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A–D)], a response similar to that elicited
by control buffer microinjection (Figure ).
Characteristic images depicting the increases in the Fura-2 fluorescence
ratio at 340 and 380 nm upon microinjection of anandamide (1 μM)
in the absence or presence of AM630 (1 μM) are shown in panels
C and D of Figure .

(B) Comparison of the increases in [Ca2+]i produced
by microinjected anandamide (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM) and anandamide

or in the presence of 1 μM AM630 (D). Arrows denote the injected
cells; the fluorescence scale (0–3) is illustrated in each
panel and magnified in the left panel of part C.

Anandamide produced negligible effects in control untransfected
U2OS cells regardless of whether it was applied extracellularly (Figure
2 of the ) or intracellularly
(Figure 3 of the ).

WIN55,212-2 Produces CB2 Receptor-Dependent Increases
in Ca2+ Concentration in CB2-U2OS Cells
Extracellular administration of WIN55,212-2 (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM)
elevated [Ca2+]i by 11 ± 8.1 nM (n = 27 cells), 17 ± 6.3 nM (n = 38
cells), and 262 ± 6.8 nM [n = 46 cells (Figure A,B)]; the latter effect was statistically significant
(P &lt; 0.05) and sensitive to CB2 blockade
with AM630 [1 μM, incubation for 10 min, Δ[Ca2+]i reduced to 12 ± 6.8 nM (n = 36
cells)] (Figure A,B). The Ca2+ response
elicited by WIN55,212-2 occurred with a latency of 1–2 min
(Figure B), similar to the effect of bath-applied
2-AG (Figure B).

Extracellular administration
of WIN55,212-2 to CB2-U2OS
cells elevates [Ca2+]i. (A) Comparison of the
increases in [Ca2+]i produced by extracellular
administration of WIN55,212-2 (WIN, 0.01–1 μM) and 1
μM WIN55,212-2 in the presence of CB2 receptor antagonist
AM630 (1 μM); P &lt; 0.05 compared with basal
levels (∗) or with 1 μM WIN55,212-2 (#). (B) Representative
recordings of increases in [Ca2+]i in response
to 1 μM WIN in the absence or presence of 1 μM CB2 antagonist AM630.

Microinjection of WIN55,212-2 (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μM,
final
concentrations inside the cell) into CB2-U2OS cells triggered
fast, transient, and concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i of 257 ± 5.3, 635 ± 7.1, and 924
± 17 nM (n = 6 cells for each concentration
tested), whereas when 1 μM AM630 was co-injected with 1 μM
WIN55,212-2, a small and insignificant increase in Ca2+ concentration, of 31 ± 4.6 nM (n = 6 cells),
was apparent (Figure A,B). Representative
examples of the increase in the F340/F380 fluorescence ratio produced by intracellular
administration of WIN55,212-2 or AM630 and WIN55,212-2 are shown in
panels C and D of Figure . The insignificant
Ca2+ responses to extracellular and intracellular administration
of WIN55,212-2 in control U2OS cells are illustrated in Figures 2
and 3 of the , respectively.

(0–3) is illustrated in each panel and magnified in the left
panel of part C.

Effects of Extracellular
2-AG and WIN55,212-2 Are Mediated by
Gq Coupling of CB2 Receptors
2-AG (1 μM),
anandamide (1 μM), or WIN55,212-2 (1 μM) was bath-applied
to CB2-U2OS cells treated overnight with chemicals interfering
with G protein signaling. After cholera toxin (CTX, 100 ng/mL) pretreatment,
2-AG produced an increase in the [Ca2+]i of
83 ± 5.1 nM [n = 61 cells (Figure A,B)] similar to the effect of 2-AG on untreated cells. CTX
irreversibly abolishes the GTPase activity of the Gs α subunit,
inducing continual activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased intracellular
levels of cAMP. In this manner, it hinders ligands of Gs-coupled receptors
from eliciting their Gs-dependent effects. After pretreatment with
the Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 ng/mL), the response
of 2-AG was negligibly modified, measuring 85 ± 4.2 nM [n = 53 cells (Figure A,B)]. Conversely,
pretreatment of CB2-U2OS cells with Gq blocker d-[Trp7,9,10]-substance P (D-SP, 100 ng/mL) greatly reduced the effect of 2-AG to 7 ± 2.7 nM [n = 67 cells (Figure A,B)].

The Ca2+ responses
produced by bath-applied 2-AG and
WIN55,212-2 are prevented by a Gq protein inhibitor. (A) Representative
examples of the Ca2+ responses induced by 1 μM 2-AG
(top), 1 μM anandamide (ANA, middle), or 1 μM WIN55,212-2
(WIN, bottom), applied by bath to CB2-expressing U2OS cells
in the presence of cholera toxin (CTX, 100 nM, top), which occludes
Gs-dependent signaling, Gi/o blocker pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 nM,
middle), or Gq protein inhibitor d-[Trp7,9,10]-substance
P (D-SP, 100 μM, bottom); 2-AG and WIN55,212-2 increased [Ca2+]i, and the response was Gq protein-mediated.
(B) Comparison of the mean amplitude of the Ca2+ responses
produced by extracellular administration of 1 μM 2-AG (left),
1 μM anandamide (middle), or 1 μM WIN55,212-2 (right)
in the absence and presence of the indicated G protein inhibitors; P &lt; 0.05 compared with WIN55,212-2 alone (∗).

The Ca2+ response elicited
by anandamide was largely
similar and not significant regardless of whether anandamide was applied
alone [Δ[Ca2+]i of 9 ± 4.7 nM (n = 33 cells)] or after stimulating Gs-dependent signaling
with CTX (100 ng/mL), inhibiting Gi/o with PTX (100 ng/mL), and inhibiting
Gq with D-SP (100 ng/mL). The Δ[Ca2+]i values were 8 ± 5.2 nM (n = 29 cells), 6 ±
4.8 nM (n = 41 cells), and 7 ± 2.3 nM (n = 36 cells), respectively (Figure A,B).

D-SP pretreatment drastically diminished the effect induced
by
WIN55,212-2, reducing it to 58 ± 3.9 nM, while in the presence
of CTX or PTX, WIN55,212-2 increased [Ca2+]i to similar extents as in their absence: Δ[Ca2+]i values were 257 ± 6.8 nM (n = 53 cells)
and 243 ± 7.9 nM (n = 47 cells) in cells pretreated
with CTX and PTX, respectively, and 262 ± 6.8 nM (n = 49 cells) for WIN55,212-2 alone (Figure A,B).

Intracellular CB2 Receptors Couple to Gq Proteins
Overnight treatment of CB2-U2OS cells with CTX (100
ng/mL) or PTX (100 ng/mL) failed to significantly modify the Ca2+ response elicited by intracellular administration of 0.1
μM 2-AG (Figure A,B). Under the conditions
described above, 2-AG increased [Ca2+]i by 654
± 21 nM (n = 6 cells) and 629 ± 18 nM (n = 6 cells), respectively, while the response to 2-AG alone
measured 652 ± 19 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)]. After incubation of cells with D-SP (100
ng/mL), the effect of 2-AG was greatly decreased to 62 ± 23 nM
(n = 6 cells), indicating participation of a Gq-dependent
pathway in the response (Figure A,B).

Intracellular
microinjection of 2-AG, anandamide, or WIN55,212-2
produces Gq-dependent Ca2+ responses in CB2-expressing
U2OS cells. (A) Averaged Ca2+ responses induced by intracellular
administration of 0.1 μM 2-AG (top), 0.1 μM anandamide
(ANA, middle), or 0.1 μM WIN55,212-2 (WIN, bottom) in CB2-U2OS cells pretreated with cholera toxin (CTX, 100 nM, top),
pertussis toxin (PTX, 100 nM, middle), or Gq protein inhibitor d-[Trp7,9,10]-substance P (D-SP, 100 μM, bottom); each
ligand increased [Ca2+]i, and the response was
sensitive to Gq protein blockade. (B) Comparison of the mean amplitude
of the Ca2+ responses produced by intracellular administration
of 0.1 μM 2-AG (left), 0.1 μM anandamide (middle), or
0.1 μM WIN55,212-2 (right) in absence and presence of the indicated
G protein inhibitors; in each group of data, P &lt;
0.05 compared with 2-AG, anandamide, or WIN55,212-2 alone (∗).

Upon pretreatment with CTX (100
ng/mL) or PTX (100 ng/mL), intracellular
injection of anandamide (0.1 μM) elevated [Ca2+]i of CB2-U2OS cells by 359 ± 7.2 nM (n = 6 cells) or 355 ± 11.2 nM (n =
6 cells), respectively; these effects are similar to those triggered
by microinjected anandamide alone [368 ± 8.4 nM (n = 6 cells)], indicating that Gs and Gi/o proteins are not mediating
its effect. Upon D-SP (100 ng/mL) pretreatment, intracellular anandamide
produced an insignificant Ca2+ response of 38 ± 6.3
nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)].

Similarly, CTX and PTX (both at 100 ng/mL) pretreatment did not
significantly modify the response of CB2-U2OS cells to
microinjected WIN55,212-2 (0.1 μM). Δ[Ca2+]i values were 668 ± 13 nM (n = 6 cells)
and 641 ± 9.8 nM (n = 6 cells) after CTX and
after PTX, respectively, and 635 ± 7.1 nM for WIN55,212-2 alone.
However, blocking Gq proteins with 100 ng/mL D-SP basically abolished
the effect of intracellular WIN55,212-2. In this case, Δ[Ca2+]i decreased to 27 ± 5.4 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)].

Activation
of Intracellular CB2 Mobilizes Ca2+ from Distinct
Pools
CB2-U2OS cells incubated
with Ca2+-free saline responded to microinjection of 0.1
μM 2-AG with a 457 ± 5.2 nM increase in [Ca2+]i (n = 6 cells), while the effect of
control buffer microinjection was negligible {Δ[Ca2+]i = 29 ± 1.7 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)]}. The response to 2-AG was reduced in Ca2+-free versus Ca2+-containing HBSS [Δ[Ca2+]i = 653 ± 19 nM (Figure )], indicating mobilization of both intracellular and extracellular
Ca2+ pools. Using a pharmacological approach, we further
sought to identify the intracellular sources of Ca2+ involved
in the response to microinjected 2-AG. Pretreatment of cells with
ryanodine receptor blocker ryanodine (10 μM, 1 h) did not significantly
modify the Ca2+ response to 2-AG, which measured 452 ±
5.9 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)]. Conversely, pretreatment with Ned-19 (5 μM, 15 min),
which blocks endolysosomal Ca2+ release via the NAADP-sensitive
two-pore channels, decreased the extent
of the Ca2+ elevation produced by 2-AG to 349 ± 4.3
nM (n = 6 cells); inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
(IP3R) inhibition induced by treating CB2-U2OS
cells with heparin and xestospongin C (10 μM, 15 min) also induced
a significant decrease in the response to 2-AG {Δ[Ca2+]i = 168 ± 3.6 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)]}. When both IP3Rs and the two-pore
channels were blocked, the Ca2+ response to intracellular
microinjection of 2-AG was completely abolished {Δ[Ca2+]i = 34 ± 2.4 nM [n = 6 cells (Figure A,B)]}.

Discussion
In addition to the effects initiated at
the plasma membrane, G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) may also trigger signaling cascades
upon their activation within the cell. The emerging paradigm of functional intracellular GPCRs is particularly
significant in the case of lipid messengers that are generated intracellularly
and may target their receptors at both sites, (reviewed in ref ()). We and others reported
the functionality of intracellularly expressed CB1 receptors,, as well as their ability to use Ca2+ as a second messenger. To evaluate whether CB2 receptors
elicit Ca2+ signaling upon plasmalemmal or intracellular
activation, cannabinoid ligands were administered extracellularly
or microinjected into U2OS cells stably expressing CB2.

We noticed that extracellular administration of 2-AG induced a
small increase in [Ca2+]i of CB2-U2OS
cells only at the highest concentration tested here (1 μM).
Bath application of anandamide did not elevate [Ca2+]i of CB2-U2OS cells. While 2-AG produced a gradual
increase in [Ca2+]i of CB2-U2OS cells,
a robust Ca2+ response was induced by extracellular administration
of WIN55,212-2, which is a cannabinoid agonist displaying high affinity
and/or intrinsic activity at this receptor., The
CB2 specificity was indicated by the ability of CB2 antagonist AM630 to inhibit
the effects of extracellular administration of 2-AG and WIN55,212-2
in CB2-U2OS cells and by the unresponsiveness of untransfected
U2OS cells to bath application of WIN55,212-2.

Similar to CB1, CB2 receptors couple to Gi
proteins and inhibit cAMP formation or activate MAPK., However, coupling to Gs or Gq of CB1 receptors has also
been reported., While a cannabinoid-dependent
[Ca2+]i increase may occur downstream of Gi,, we noticed that the CB2-dependent effects of 2-AG or
WIN55,212-2 were completely contingent on Gq in our paradigm. WIN55,212-2
also activates Gq downstream of CB1; moreover, it can trigger a CB2-dependent signaling
pathway different from that elicited by other ligands. Thus, the discrepancy between the effects of extracellular
administration of anandamide, 2-AG, and WIN55,212-2 in our study may
be a result of the reported functional selectivity at CB2 receptors.,

In a recent study, we demonstrated
that anandamide can trigger
fast CB1-dependent Ca2+ signaling upon microinjection
but is ineffective upon extracellular administration in CB1-transfected cells. To test the hypothesis
of functional intracellular CB2 receptors in CB2-U2OS cells, intracellular injections of 2-AG, anandamide, or WIN55,212-2
were conducted. When 2-AG or anandamide was microinjected, concentration-dependent
elevations of [Ca2+]i were observed, and the
Ca2+ response pattern was very fast, which is in contrast
with the delayed, modest response and lack of effect, respectively,
observed with the extracellular administration of these two agonists.
Likewise, intracellular administration of WIN55,212-2 resulted in
a concentration-dependent and robust effect. WIN55,212-2 and 2-AG
produced Ca2+ responses with an amplitude higher than that
of anandamide, which is consistent with the full agonistic activity
at CB2 receptors reported for these ligands., The sensitivity of these responses to the intracellular blockade
of CB2 and the unresponsiveness of control, untransfected
U2OS cells to microinjected cannabinoids were considered to be indicative
of CB2 specificity. We further noticed that interfering
with Gq-dependent, but not with Gs- or Gi/o-dependent, signaling prevented
the effect of microinjected 2-AG, anandamide, or WIN55,212-2. Moreover,
the endocannabinoids and WIN55,212-2 trigger similar signaling pathways
upon intracellular administration, despite their unrelated chemical
structure.

The accumulating evidence pointing to endolysosomes
as intracellular
locations where GPCRs initiate
signaling,,,, prompted us to evaluate
whether this may be the case for CB2. In an initial functional
study, we found that the effect of intracellular 2-AG is abolished
by lysosomal disruption. Because rapamycin reduced the effects of
microinjected 2-AG, ligand microautophagy may be a necessary step in the activation of endolysosomally located
CB2. The localization of CB2 to lysosomes was
confirmed by an additional study, providing morphological evidence
that CB2 colocalizes with the endolysosomal-associated
small GTPase Rab7. Lysosomal disruption with bafilomycin A1 markedly
reduced the fluorescence intensity of both CB2 and Rab7,
supporting the findings of the functional study.

Next, we sought
to examine the pools of Ca2+ mobilized
upon activation of intracellularly located CB2. The reduction
in the amplitude of the Ca2+ response of CB2-U2OS cells incubated with Ca2+-free saline to microinjected
2-AG indicated that both influx of extracellular Ca2+ and
release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores occur downstream
of intracellular CB2 activation. Using a pharmacological
approach, we further determined that 2-AG-induced stimulation of intracellular
CB2 results in Ca2+ mobilization from endolysosomes
via NAADP-sensitive two-pore channels and from the endoplasmic reticulum
via the IP3R. This effect correlates well with the localization
of CB2 at the endolysosmes, as well as with the localization
of NAADP-generating enzymes, at the membrane of
acidic organelles.

Thus, we conclude
that intracellular CB2 receptors are
functional, endolysosomally located, and Gq-coupled in CB2-U2OS cells, and their activation mobilizes NAADP-sensitive acidic-like
Ca2+ stores and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive
endoplasmic reticulum pools. In addition, we note that CB2 agonists elicit discrepant and delayed effects and exhibit a considerably
lower potency when administered extracellularly as opposed to intracellularly.
Although these effects appear to be Gq-mediated, it may be that a
considerable pool of plasmalemmal CB2 receptors do not
couple with Gq/Ca2+ signaling. Conversely, Gq coupling
and associated Ca2+ responses may be a characteristic of
intracellularly located CB2, in which case the delay in
the effects elicited by agonists upon extracellular administration
may be a result of the latency necessary for membrane permeation.
Nonetheless, differential activation of plasmalemmal CB2 by the three agonists (applied extracellularly) is more likely to
be a result of the functional selectivity at CB2,, which is supported by the previous finding that 2-AG (which promotes
agonist-directed trafficking at CB2) has a low potency at eliciting CB2-mediated
Ca2+ responses. Binding of
a particular agonist to a GPCR results in the enrichment of a unique
set of receptor conformations based on the microaffinity of the agonist
for each conformation; because distinct conformations presumably couple
receptors differently to specific G proteins and intracellular effectors,
individual agonists ultimately produce distinct effects. As such, anandamide, 2-AG, and WIN55,212-2 may
induce conformational changes in plasmalemmal CB2, resulting
in distinct responses, as observed in the study presented here. However,
we note that this is not the case with intracellular, endolysosomally
located CB2, which appears to couple to the same Gq-mediated
Ca2+ pathway in response to intracellular administration
of the three agonists; moreover, the three agonists have higher potency
and efficacy at eliciting intracellularly initiated CB2-dependent Ca2+ responses. Thus, functional selectivity
may apply more to plasmalemmal than to intracellular CB2.

On a different note, plasma membrane-located CB2 is
internalized upon agonist stimulation and slowly recycled back to
the cell surface via a Rab11-dependent pathway, while rapid recycling,
via Rab4, does not occur. Moreover, in
the case of CB2, not all receptors are recycled, and chronic
agonist stimulation does not promote switching from recycling to degradative
pathways, supporting the hypothesis of a putative role of sequestration
of the CB2 receptor to the cytoplasm following internalization.

Our results, together with those of others, add further complexity to the CB2 receptor pharmacology
and argue for careful consideration of receptor localization in the
development of CB2-based therapeutic agents. Moreover,
because 2-AG is intracellularly produced “on demand”, its first target may be intracellularly located
CB2, which may be relevant both in physiological states
and in pathologies with an increased level of production of endocannabinoids.
