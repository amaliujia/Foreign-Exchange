The lipid
droplet protein perilipin 2 (Plin2, also known as adipose differentiation-related
protein, ADRP, or adipophilin) has been shown to play a key role in
lipid droplet formation and intracellular
triglyceride accumulation− and to bind lipids with high affinity,− yet little is known about the structure or location of its lipid
binding site(s). This represents a significant gap in knowledge since
there is evidence that Plin2’s binding capacity may influence
several lipid parameters including fatty acid uptake, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated cholesterol uptake/efflux,, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) content in mouse models
of obesity. In fact, a genetic variation
in the Plin2 gene causing a serine to proline mutation
(Ser251Pro) results in dysregulation of plasma lipid and lipoprotein
profiles in humans, possibly due to disruption
of helical structure within a putative lipid binding site. As part
of the Plin (or PAT, for perilipin/ADRP/TIP47) family of lipid droplet targeting proteins
which includes Plin1/perilipin, Plin2/ADRP, Plin3/TIP47, Plin4/S3–12,
and Plin5/OXPAT, Plin2 shares high sequence homology with members
of the group. With Plin1 and other lipid droplet-associated proteins such as caveolins, the targeting and anchoring of proteins depends
on targeting signals in the form of hydrophobic sequences. These signals
are not, however, conserved in Plin2, suggesting different lipid droplet targeting mechanisms exist among
lipid droplet associated proteins. In support of this, Plin2 contains
two lipid droplet targeting domains that are not hydrophobic in nature., These domains are nonoverlapping suggesting that targeting of Plin2
to lipid droplets is controlled by the tertiary structure in which
contributing residues are brought together to form the targeting signal., Likewise, the lipid binding site of Plin2 may also be defined by
the tertiary structure of the protein and may not be easily described
by a linear sequence motif. In keeping with this, there is evidence
that binding of cholesterol and other lipids by membrane proteins
often occurs in grooves between helices and involves conserved spatial
motifs.− On the basis of sequence similarity and predicted structure,, several conserved regions
within Plin2 have the potential to bind lipids including (1) a highly
conserved N-terminal hydrophobic domain (residues 1–115) known
as the PAT domain, that is involved in lipid droplet
stabilization, lipid accumulation, and proteasomal degradation of
Plin2;, (2) the N-terminal 11-mer repeating domain
located within residues 103–215, that is believed
to participate with part of the C-terminal domain to regulate secretion
of milk lipids by forming an adaptive link between lipid droplets
and the plasma membrane; (3) two predicted
lipid droplet targeting domains in the middle and C-terminal regions
of the protein;, and (4) a C-terminal α–β
domain and a 4-helix bundle domain reminiscent of the LDL receptor
binding domain of apolipoprotein E. The
last structure was predicted based on homology between Plin2 and the
known crystal structure of the closely related Plin3. In Plin3, the α–β domain and 4-helix
bundle fold together into an L-shape, forming a cleft (13 Å at
its widest, 18 Å long, and 10 Å deep) with several hydrophobic
residues and a deep polar pocket of sufficient size to accommodate
lipid ligands and interact with their polar groups. Since Plin2 and
Plin3 share 42% overall sequence identity throughout and 35% identity
in the C-terminal region (NCBI BLAST), substantial structural similarity
is expected. In fact, a comprehensive study has shown that sequences
with at least 25% identity over at least 80 residues have backbone
structures that overlay closely. Recently,
a structural model was presented for Plin2 based on sequence similarity
to the known three-dimensional structures of Plin3, apolipoprotein
A1, the signal receiver domain of a putative luxo repressor protein,
and dihydroorotate reductase. Work presented
here supports that an apolipophorin-like N-terminal domain and a Plin3-like
C-terminal domain together can account for the overall tertiary fold
of Plin2. Others have noted structural similarities between apolipoproteins
and the N-terminal domain of Plin proteins. Both contain 11-mer repeats (located within helix α4 and the
α–β domain in Plin2) that are found in other lipid-
or membrane-associated proteins including phosphate cytidyltransferases
and synucleins, suggesting these domains
may serve as lipid interacting sites in these proteins. In support
of these findings, others have shown that structure predictions of
11-mer repeats, such as those described in the N-terminal regions
of Plin2 and Plin3, do not produce stable helical entities in proteins
such as synucleins, and only adopt a helical structure
upon interaction of lipid ligands or lipid membranes. Interestingly Bulankina et al. demonstrated that the 11-mer
repeat region in Plin3 interacted with lipid droplet membranes through
residues 87–198. Moreover, it
was suggested that Plin3 adopts a distinct N-terminal and C-terminal
structure that extends upon membrane interaction to accommodate the
lipid structure and cause lipid reorganization. Thus, despite structural similarities between Plin2 and
Plin3, differences in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions contribute
to the distinct functions of the proteins.

The present investigation
was undertaken to examine the structure and location of the Plin2
lipid binding site(s) within conserved domains by characterizing Plin2
and several deletion mutants using molecular modeling, fluorescence
binding, circular dichroism, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) techniques. Evidence is provided that lipid binding by Plin2
does not require the full-length protein but instead employs residues
from two helical bundle domains for highest affinity lipid binding
and targeting to lipid droplets, activities that are dependent on
strong Plin2-lipid or Plin2-membrane interactions. Crucial residues
within these domains are 119–251, a region that contains helix
α4, the α–β domain (α5, β3),
and part of helix α6, included in the cleft region. Residues
within ConSurf analysis shows that surface-exposed residues within
the cleft are highly conserved and likely to be functionally important.
Furthermore, flexible docking of stearic acid and cholesterol into
this region indicates favorable interactions with both ligands and
the cleft formed from a polar pocket with surrounding hydrophobic
residues. Since mutations in this region of Plin2 resulted in dysregulation
of plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles in humans, study of the functional importance of this area is warranted.

Plasmids
The full coding sequence of mouse Plin2 cDNA was cloned into pQE9-His
vector (Origene, Rockville, MD) following standard procedures. Unique
restriction sites BamHI and HindIII
were introduced by PCR amplification with the following forward and
reverse primers: Plin2-forward, 5′-CAC GGA TCC ATG GCA GCA
GCA GTA GTA GAT CCG CAA C-3′ and Plin2-reverse, 5′-GTG
AAG CTT TTA CTG AGC TTT GAC CTC-3′. The forward primer was
designed with a silent mutation where guanine was replaced by adenine
in the Plin2 sequence to remove a BamHI site located

Expression
and Purification of Recombinant Proteins in Escherichia coli Cells
Recombinant Plin2 and the deletion mutants were purified
as previously described with some modifications. Briefly, proteins were overexpressed in E. coli host strain M15 and grown at 37 °C in 1 L cultures containing
2X-YT medium with 100 μg/mL ampicillin until OD600 = 0.8, followed by induction with IPTG (1 mM). After 1 h, cells
were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C for 30 min at 3500g). For purification of Plin2, Plin2-I, Plin2-N1, and Plin2-N2,
pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer A then sonicated. Lysates
were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 25000g, and the pellet was solubilized in Buffer B and applied to a Ni-NTA
column equilibrated in Buffer B. The column was sequentially washed
with buffers B, C and D, and E. The protein was eluted using Buffer
L and then checked for purity by SDS-PAGE analysis. For deletion mutants
Plin2-C1 and Plin2-C2, the pelleted cells were resuspended in Buffer
F, sonicated, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 25000g. The resulting pellet was washed 2× each with buffers
G and H, solubilized in Buffer I, and centrifuged at 4 °C for
15 min at 25000g. The supernatant was then sequentially
dialyzed against PBS containing 10 mM DTT in decreasing concentrations
of urea (6, 5, and 4 M urea). The protein in 4 M urea was then loaded
onto a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in Buffer J. The column was then
sequentially washed with the buffers J and K, and then eluted with
Buffer L. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described in
ref () allowed assignment
of protein purity.

Plin2 Structural Prediction and Analysis
The Hopp and Woods hydropathy analysis method (web server: http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/molkit/hydropathy/index.html) was used to predict hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments within
Plin2 based on a hydrophilicity index assigned to the amino acids,
averaged over six successive residues. The PAT domain and two lipid
droplet targeting domains in Plin2 were previously described.,, The secondary structure of Plin2
was predicted by the PredictProtein server at http://www.predictprotein.org. This method has greater than 72% accuracy,
on average, in assigning α-helical, β-strand (extended)
or loop conformation to protein residues. Secondary structural predictions
of the Plin2 N-terminal region (residues 1–171) were consistent
with further analysis by PSIPRED,, SAM, and SABLE2. On
the basis of their significant (35%) sequence identity, the Plin2
C-terminal domain structure was modeled by homology to the structure
of residues 209–431 in Plin3 from
Protein Data Bank entry 1SZI() by using Modeler,, as implemented in the ModWeb Web server (salilab.org/modweb). Given
the absence of close homologues of known structure to the Plin2 N-terminal
region, this sequence was submitted for analysis by the Pcons fold
recognition web server (http://pcons.net/) to identify
the three-dimensional structural fold providing the most compatible
amino acid environments and secondary structures. By comparing the
top-scoring predictions from 11 different three-dimensional modeling
methods (Pcons, Pmodeller, PconsM, blast, forte, fugue, hhpred2, nfold,
rpsblast, sam-t02, and sam-t08), Pcons selected the structural model
for the N-terminal Plin2 region showing the highest degree of structural
consensus among the results. The degree of amino acid conservation
within 38 homologues of the C-terminal domain of ADRP was assessed
by ConSurf (http://consurf.tau.ac.il/), which automatically
detects homologues, performs multiple sequence alignment, and maps
amino acid conservation values onto the structure., Molecular graphics figures were rendered using PYMOL (Schrödinger,
LLC). Stearic acid interactions with
the modeled Plin2 C-terminal domain were assessed by extracting the
3-dimensional structure of stearic acid from the PDB X-ray structure
1HMT. Partial charges were assigned to
its atoms with Molcharge v. 1.3.1 software from OpenEye Scientific
Software (http://www.eyesopen.com; Santa Fe, NM). Low-energy
(favorable) flexible conformations of highly flexible stearic acid
were then generated by using Omega2 v. 2.3.2 (also from OpenEye Scientific
Software). Similarly, the 3-dimensional structure of cholesterol (residue
3001D) was extracted from PDB entry 3KDP. Partial
charges were assigned with Molcharge, and low-energy conformations
of the cholesterol hydrophobic tail were sampled with Omega2. The
stearic acid and cholesterol conformers were evaluated for their ability
to interact favorably with the conserved cleft in the 3-dimensional
model of the C-terminal domain structure of Plin2 by using SLIDE version
3.3.5 software to dock each conformer of stearic acid or cholesterol
into the cleft between the α–β domain and 4-helix
bundle, and selecting the orientation and conformation with the most
favorable predicted ΔGbinding to
Plin2, as assessed by SLIDE AffiScore. SLIDE models side-chain flexibility
in both molecules during docking.

Cells
Culture and Transfections
Mouse L cell fibroblasts expressing
CFP-labeled Plin2 and the deletion mutants were generated as described using mammalian expression vector pECFP-N1 and
unique restriction sites (XhoI, KpnI) introduced by PCR. Resulting expression plasmids were sequenced
to verify identity and fidelity and then stably transfected into L
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 from Life Technologies (Grand Island,
NY) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Clones surviving
selection with G418 were cell-sorted for strong CFP signal under sterile
conditions using an INFLUX cell sorter (BD scientific, Palo Alto,
CA) and screened by Western blot analysis and fluorescence imaging
to ensure stable expression of CFP-labeled protein. Mock transfectants
(clones transfected with vector DNA without insert) were generated
in parallel and were designated as controls.

Urea Denaturation Studies
To show the effects of protein unfolding on Plin2 tryptophan residues,
protein-denaturation studies in the presence of urea were performed
as described. In brief, the intrinsic
tryptophan fluorescence (excitation 295 nm, emission 300–400
nm) of three Plin2 tryptophans located at positions 283, 286, and
398 was collected using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Varian, Walnut Creek, CA) at constant temperature (25 °C) before
and after addition of increasing amounts of urea (up 6 M) to Plin2
(100 nM) in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5. Samples were
allowed to equilibrate 2 min after addition of each urea aliquot.
Data were corrected for background scatter originating from the buffer
and analyzed to graphically show the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum
at increasing urea concentrations and the percent fluorescence remaining
after each addition.

Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Binding
Studies
The binding of cholesterol and stearic acid to Plin2
was examined by measuring the fluorescence quenching of Plin2 tryptophan
residues after addition of ligand as described., In brief, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Plin2 (100 nM
in 10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5) was monitored from
300 to 400 nm after excitation at 295 nm (to minimize interference
from Plin2 tyrosine fluorescence) both before and after addition of
increasing increments of cholesterol, stearic acid, arachidonic acid,
and docosahexaenoic acid (up to 100 nM) using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Data was corrected for background scatter originating
from the buffer and increasing ligand without protein present. The
intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in the presence of different concentrations
of ligand was plotted as the maximum fluorescence difference (ΔF = Fo – F) vs ligand concentration to yield a saturation curve where F and Fo were the measured fluorescence
emission intensity of the protein solution in the presence and absence
of ligand, respectively. The dissociation constant Kd was determined from the double reciprocal plot of the
saturation curve. Linear regression of 1/[1 – (F/Fmax)] versus [ligand]/(F/Fmax) yielded a slope = 1/Kd and ordinate intercept = nEo/Kd where F represented
fluorescence intensity at a given concentration of ligand, Fmax was
the maximal fluorescence, [ligand] was the ligand concentration, Eo was the protein concentration, and n equaled the number of
ligand binding sites.

NBD-Labeled Ligand Binding Assays
Since not all of the deletion mutations contained tryptophan residues,
a fluorescent ligand binding assay was developed using NBD-cholesterol
and NBD-stearic acid as described.− In brief, NBD-labeled lipids were added
incrementally (0–300 nM) to proteins (Plin2 and Plin2 deletion
mutants) at 100 nM in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH 7.5). Samples were
allowed to mix 2–5 min after each addition before exciting
at 469 nm. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 490 to
600 nm and integrated. Data were corrected for both background scatter
originating from the buffer and increasing ligand without protein
present. A saturation curve developed by plotting fluorescence intensities
vs ligand concentration and the double reciprocal plot of this curve
allowed determination of Kd as discussed
previously.

Colocalization Studies
To show the
ability of Plin2 and the deletion mutants to target to lipid droplets,
colocalization studies were performed as described, with
cells expressing full-length Plin2 or one of the deletion constructs.
Cells seeded at a density of 50 000 cells/well in 4-well chamber
slides (EZ Slide, Millipore, Billerica, MA) were treated overnight
with oleic acid (100 μM) 4–5 h after plating. After 16
h, cells were incubated with NBD-Cholesterol (2 μM) for 2 h,
then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature followed
by washing (3×) with PBS. The cells were then blocked with 2%
BSA and incubated with rabbit anti-CFP antibody (1:50) for 1 h at
room temperature. Since the transfected cells express CFP-labeled
proteins (as described above), anti-CFP was used in place of anti-Plin2
to discriminate endogenous Plin2 from the transfected mutant proteins.
After extensive washing, cells were incubated with Cy5 labeled antirabbit
secondary antibody (1:100) in 2% BSA for 1 h. Cells were washed with
PBS and mounted with coverslips using fluorogel mounting medium (Electron
Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA). As a control, cells were also labeled
with the Cy5-labeled secondary antibody alone. Images were acquired
sequentially on an Olympus FluoView 1000 Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope
(Olympus Inc., Center Valley, CA) equipped with an IX81 automated
inverted microscope and operated with Fluoview software. Fluorescence
emission was detected using 488 nm excitation and 500/100 band path
emission filter for NBD-cholesterol (green channel) and 635 nm excitation
with a 725/30 band path filter for the Cy5 emission (red channel).
To minimize photobleaching, samples were exposed to the light source
for minimal time periods. Image files were analyzed using Metamorph
software (West Chester, PA). Images derived from the red and green
channels were combined and appeared as yellow to orange where superimposition
of images derived from the red and green channels overlapped.

Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer Microscopy
Acceptor photobleaching
experiments were performed as previously described, on
cells labeled as described above by measuring the fluorescence emission
of the NBD donor through the 500/100 nm filter upon excitation at
488 nm both before and after photobleaching of the Cy5-acceptor excited
at 635 nm. Control experiments were performed to limit interference
from nonspecific fluorescence including (1) imaging nonlabeled cells
to determine autofluorescence in the green channel (NBD) while maintaining
maximum dynamic range; (2) adjusting the gain and black levels in
the red channel after excitation at 635 nm to limit fluorescence bleed-through
into the green channel; (3) photobleaching NBD-labeled donor cells
without Cy5 present to check for nonspecific fluorescent increases
in the donor channel to ensure that the donor intensity was not affected
by bleaching the cells; and (4) leaving one or two cells unbleached
during the FRET experiment to serve as in-field bleaching control.
To calculate the FRET efficiency (E), representing
the efficiency of energy transfer between donor and acceptor, the
following equation was used: E = 1 – (IDA/ID) where IDA is donor fluorescence intensity before acceptor
photobleaching and ID is the donor fluorescence
intensity after acceptor photobleaching. An average E value was calculated from the NBD fluorescence emission increase
after photobleaching. The intermolecular distance R between NBD-label and the Cy5-labeled Plin2 was calculated from
the equation R = R0(1/E – 1)(1/6), where E was
experimentally determined and R0 was the
Förster radius for the NBD-Cy5 FRET pair (56 Å). Since
accurate determination within the cellular environment of parameters
of the probes (e.g., donor quantum yield, acceptor extinction coefficient,
and dipole orientation factor between donor/acceptor pair) involved
in the calculation of R0 is difficult,
interaction distances (R) were also presented in
terms of R0, with R0 &lt; 75 Å such that κ2 &lt; 4.

Circular Dichroic Analysis of Secondary Structure
The far UV circular dichroic (CD) spectra of each protein was measured
in phosphate buffer (10 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5 with
10 mM NaCl) in the presence and absence of ligand (cholesterol or
stearic acid) to a final concentration of 5 μM. Experiments
were performed at 25 °C in a 1 mm path length cuvette using a
JASCO J-815 CD spectrometer (JASCO Analytical Instruments, Easton,
MD). Experiments with ligand were allowed to incubate for 2–5
min prior to each scan to allow maximal protein–ligand interaction.
CD spectra were recorded from 270 to 190 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm/min
with a time constant of 1 s and bandwidth of 2 nm. For each experiment,
10 iterations were performed in triplicate. Secondary structure analysis
was carried out using the CDSSTR analysis program with results reported as percentages of regular α-helices,
distorted α-helices, regular β-strands, distorted β-strands,
turns and unordered structures. In a separate experiment, measurements
on purified recombinant Plin2 were performed at 5 °C, 25 °C,
and 40 °C to determine the dependence of secondary structure
on temperature.

Statistics
All values were expressed
as the means ± SE. Statistical analyses were performed using
Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA with Newman
Keuls posthoc test (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA) to determine statistical
significance. Values with P &lt; 0.05 or less were
considered significant.

Results
Prediction of Plin2 Secondary
Structure and Conserved Domains
To understand how ligand
binding relates to structure, the secondary structure of Plin2 was
predicted using several prediction programs including PredictProtein, PSIPRED,, SAM, and SABLE2. Results from these
programs indicated that the secondary structure of Plin2 is mostly
α-helical in nature (9 α-helices) with 5 β strands
interconnected by random coils (Figure A).
The Plin2 N-terminal region contains two β-strands (β1,
β2) and four α-helices (α1, α2, α3,
and α4). On the basis of homology to the C-terminal domain of
the crystal structure of Plin3, the Plin2 C-terminal region is predicted
to contain an α–β domain (α5, β3),
a 4-helix bundle (α6- α9), and two β-strands (β4,
β5) that together form a deep cleft that is conserved in the
perilipin family and large enough to bind lipids. In addition, several conserved regions have been identified
within Plin2 including a highly conserved hydrophobic domain within
the N-terminal region (residues 1–115) known as the PAT domain
(Figure B), which was shown to participate
in the stabilization and accumulation of lipid droplets and to determine
proteasomal degradation of Plin2;− an 11-mer repeating
unit of unknown function within residues 103-215 (Figure A); and two lipid droplet targeting domains, located in the middle and C-terminal regions (Figure B) that participated with part of the C-terminal domain to
regulate secretion of milk lipids., Alternating
patterns of hydrophobic/hydrophilic segments are observed in Plin2
(Figure C) and Plin3 (Figure D) over the N-terminal PAT domain and 11-mer repeat region
from patterns of hydrophobicity predicted using the method of Hopp
and Woods. In keeping with the high degree
of homology shared between these proteins, similar hydrophobic characteristics
were observed for both Plin2 and Plin3. Large segments of hydrophobic
sequence conducive to membrane targeting were not observed with either
protein, suggesting that regions within the protein come together
spatially to form larger recognition surfaces for hydrophobic ligands
including the membrane itself.

Predicted secondary structure and conserved
domains of Plin2. On the basis of prediction software (SABLE2, SAM
and PsiPRED) and the known X-ray crystal structure of the homologous
Plin3 protein, the predicted structure of Plin2 (A) contains nine
α-helices and five small β strands interconnected by random
coils and unordered structure. Several regions of interest include
the PAT domain (B), 11-mer repeat region (A), two lipid droplet (LD)
targeting domains (B), and the C-terminal area containing an α–β
domain (A) and 4-helix bundle (A) that together formed a cleft region.
Residues that line the cleft (indicated by *) include Val-203, Tyr-215,
Ala-233, Arg-236, Val-237, Ala-240, Thr-325, Val-326, Asn-329, Gln-331,
Trp-398, Leu-399, Val-400, Pro-402 and Phe-403. Hopp-Woods hydrophilicity
plots for Plin2 (C) and Plin3 (D) were generated using a server at
the Colorado State University (http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/molkit/hydropathy/index.html) to provide predicted hydrophilic (lines above zero) and hydrophobic
regions (below zero) within the proteins. Line diagrams of Plin2 and
the deletion mutants (E) include full-length Plin2 (containing amino
acid residues 1–425); Plin2-C1 (residues 119–425); Plin2-C2
(residues 251–425); Plin2-N1 (residues 1–119); and Plin2-N2
(residues 1–251); and Plin2-I (residues1–171 and 219–425).

To assess the lipid binding affinities
of these regions, Plin2 and several Plin2 deletion mutants that contain
select regions within Plin2 with the potential to bind lipids were
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as recombinant
proteins. The deletion mutants included regions containing the PAT
domain, one or two of the lipid droplet
targeting domains,, or the central alpha/beta domain
residues near the cleft in the C-terminal region (Figure E).

Effect of Urea and Temperature
on Plin2 Structure: Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence Quenching and
CD Analysis
Recombinant full-length Plin2 protein was overexpressed
and purified as described in the  section (see ). To determine if the recombinant Plin2 protein
was conformational and functionally intact, two distinct experiments
were performed. First, to show the effects of protein unfolding, Plin2
was titered against increasing amounts of urea, up to 6 M. Protein
unfolding was monitored via tryptophan fluorescence, as described
in ref () and in
the  section. Tryptophan
fluorescence, in contrast to tyrosine fluorescence, is sensitive to
solvent polarity; therefore it can be used as a measure of protein
folding. Plin2 contains three tryptophan
residues in the C-terminal region at positions 283, 286, and 398.
More importantly, the tryptophan residues are located in the 4-helix
bundle of the predicted binding region of the protein. Analysis of
the Plin2 tryptophan fluorescence emission collected from 300 to 400
nm showed the refolded full-length Plin2 protein exhibited a typical
emission spectra with maxima at 327 nm (Figure A), indicating a blue-shift relative to tryptophan in water where
the fluorescence maximum is 348 nm. Addition
of increasing concentrations of urea (up to 6 M) resulted in fluorescence
quenching of one or more of the three tryptophan residues (Figure A). A red-shift in the emission maxima to 332 nm
at 4.6 M urea was observed, indicating increased exposure of the residues
to the hydrophilic solvent. At 6 M urea, only 22% of the initial tryptophan
fluorescence remained indicating substantial exposure of the tryptophan
residues to the solvent. It is this 78% decrease in tryptophan fluorescence
and red shift that is indicative of denaturation of the refolded protein
(Figure B).

Tryptophan fluorescence (total and percent
of initial) upon urea denaturation and circular dichroism of Plin2
as a function of temperature. Protein-denaturation studies were performed
by addition of increasing aliquots of urea (0–6.0M) to recombinant
Plin2. The tryptophan emission spectra (A) upon excitation at 280
nm and percent fluorescence of initial (B) was determined to show
the overall effect of solvent polarity upon protein stability. Exposure
of tryptophan residues to solvent upon denaturation resulted in decreased
fluorescence due to quenching of residues. The effect of temperature
on Plin2 secondary structure was determined by circular dichroism
(C) to show Plin2 unfolding at temperatures above 40 °C.

Second, to show the effects of
protein unfolding on Plin2 secondary structure, changes in the CD
spectra at increasing temperatures were examined. At room temperature
(25 °C) recombinant Plin2 exhibited a double minimum at ∼208
and 222 nm signifying substantial amounts of α-helices were
present (Figure C). However, the molar ellipticity
at 208 nm was lower than at 222 nm suggesting a subtle influence of
random coils and β-sheets. Upon lowering the temperature to
5 °C, the minima at 208 and 222 nm were intensified, consistent
with slower conformational transitions and enhanced resolution. In
contrast, at 40 °C the protein began losing its secondary structure
as the peak intensities approached zero molar ellipticity (Figure C). Results from these studies indicated that Plin2
tryptophans in the refolded protein were sensitive to urea denaturation.
Moreover, CD analysis of the secondary structure of the refolded protein
was consistent with predictions and exhibited enhanced resolution
at lower temperatures but destabilization when temperatures were increased
above room temperature.

Tryptophan Quenching Binding Studies: Full-Length
Plin2 Binds Cholesterol, Stearic Acid, Arachidonic Acid, and Docosahexaenoic
Acid (DHA) with High Affinity
The binding affinities of full-length
Plin2 for cholesterol, stearic acid, arachidonic acid, and DHA were
determined by measuring changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
of Plin2 upon ligand addition as described in the  section. Fluorescence quenching of one
or more of the three tryptophan residues located in the C-terminal
4-helix bundle resulted in a decrease in fluorescence signal intensity
when ligand was added. It should also be noted that in some cases
binding of ligand can increase tryptophan fluorescence. In situations
where an increase is observed, the tryptophan residues become embedded
in a hydrophobic environment either by directly interacting with the
lipid residue or by a conformational change in which the reverse of
tryptophan quenching occurs. Since addition of the lipid ligand was
seen to cause conformational changes in Plin2, the decrease in tryptophan
fluorescence upon lipid binding in the present work is thought to
arise from the exposure of tryptophans to water. Saturable binding
curves for cholesterol (Figure A), stearic
acid (Figure B), arachidonic acid (Figure C), and DHA (Figure D) were
observed and the dissociation constant Kd determined for each ligand to reveal Kd values of 7 ± 1 nM, 80 ± 9 nM, 22 ± 1 nM, and 46
± 6 nM, respectively at a single site that was not necessarily
the same for each ligand. Thus, Plin2 exhibited very high affinity
for cholesterol and less so for the saturated fatty acid stearic acid,
consistent with values obtained from previous studies.,, High affinity binding was also
observed with the polyunsaturated fatty acids arachidonic acid (20:4n-6)
and DHA (22:6n-3), indicating that the purified recombinant Plin2
protein contained an active ligand binding site for these lipids.

Tryptophan
quenching binding assays. The Plin2 binding affinity for cholesterol
(A), stearic acid (B), arachidonic acid (C), and DHA (D) was determined
when titered with increasing amounts of ligand (1–120 nM) using
a quenching of tryptophan fluorescence assay as described in the . Inset, a linear plot of 1/(1
– F/Fmax) versus
[ligand]/(F/Fmax) allowed
determination of the dissociation constant Kd where the slope of the line = 1/Kd and the ordinate intercept = nEo/Kd and F represent fluorescence
intensity at a given concentration of ligand, Fmax is the maximal fluorescence, [ligand] is the ligand concentration, Eo is the protein concentration, and n equals the number of binding sites. Analysis of multiple
curves yielded Kd of 7 ± 1 nM, 80
± 9 nM, 22 ± 1 nM, and 46 ± 6 nM for cholesterol, stearic
acid, arachidonic acid, and DHA, respectively.

NBD-Labeled Binding Studies: Plin2 and Deletion Mutants Bind Cholesterol
and Stearic Acid with Selective Affinity
Recombinant Plin2
deletion mutants were overexpressed and purified as described in the  section (see ). To establish
the ability of Plin2 and the deletion mutants to bind lipids such
as cholesterol and stearic acid, NBD-labeled lipid binding assays
were performed as previously described.− The NBD-fluorophore in NBD-lipids was sensitive
to environmental hydrophobicity and therefore provided a useful tool
to determine ligand binding affinity. NBD-cholesterol showed minimal
fluorescence in aqueous buffer with an emission maximum (λmax) equal to 545 nm. Addition of Plin2 or the deletion mutant
proteins resulted in increased fluorescence with shifts in λmax to blue wavelengths (0–5 nm) indicating binding
of the probe to a site increasingly more hydrophobic than the aqueous
buffer (Table ). With full-length Plin2, Kd = 11 ± 2 nM (Table ), in keeping with results from the tryptophan quenching studies
(Figure A) and with previous reports., In comparison, deletion mutants Plin2-C1 (Figure B), Plin2-I (Figure F), Plin2-N2 (Figure E), and Plin2-C2 (Figure C) showed significantly less affinity for NBD-cholesterol (Table ). Most interestingly, deletion mutant Plin2-N1
(Figure D) did not bind NBD-cholesterol, showing
little to no increase in fluorescence over the buffer control. This
last result indicated that the cholesterol binding site for Plin2
did not reside within the PAT domain.

Titration of Plin2 and the deletion mutant
proteins with NBD-cholesterol. The binding affinities of Plin2 (A),
Plin2-C1 (B), Plin2-C2 (C), Plin2-N1 (D), Plin2-N2 (E), and Plin2-I
(F) for NBD-cholesterol were determined using a fluorescence binding
assay. The titration of the recombinant proteins with NBD-cholesterol
was followed by an increase in fluorescence (excitation 480 nm, emission
540 nm). The data representing the mean ± SE of three independent
measurements were fit to a single binding site model as described
in . Inset, a linear
plot of 1/(1 – F/Fmax) versus [ligand]/(F/Fmax) was used to determine the Kd as previously
described where F represents fluorescence intensity
at a given concentration of ligand, Fmax is the maximal fluorescence, and [ligand] is the ligand concentration.

no detectable binding was observed.

In a similar fashion, the full-length protein bound
NBD-stearic acid with Kd = 121 ±
12 nM. These results were comparable to the higher affinity observed
(Kd = 80 ± 9 nM) with unlabeled stearic
acid in the tryptophan quenching study (Figure B). Likely, the decrease in affinity observed with the labeled ligand
was due to the NBD group and its position within the binding pocket.
However, despite the differences in Kd values between the labeled and unlabeled ligands, both bound with
affinities consistent with results from previous reports., NBD-lipid binding studies were also performed with acyl CoA binding
protein (ACBP), a cytosolic lipid binding protein that exclusively
binds long-chain fatty acyl CoA but not
cholesterol or fatty acids. When increasing
concentrations of NBD-lipids were added to ACBP in solution, no increase
in fluorescence was observed after background subtraction, indicating
that ACBP did not bind either lipid (data not shown). These results
support the specificity of Plin2 for NBD-labeled lipids.

Intracellular
Targeting and FRET Analysis
The extent of Plin2/lipid interactions
on the lipid droplet surface were determined in a series of experiments
using NBD-labeled cholesterol in colocalization and FRET assays. First,
colabeling of NBD-cholesterol with Cy5-labeled Plin2 overexpressed
in L cells was accomplished as described in the  section and repeated with each deletion mutant.
Simultaneous acquisition of multiple confocal images of NBD-cholesterol
colabeled with Cy5-proteins revealed the following: (1) Plin2 (Figure A) and Plin2-I (Figure F)
expression cells showed increased numbers of lipid droplets as compared
to the control (data not shown) and other mutant expression cell lines.
Likewise, these expression cells showed full targeting to the lipid
droplet surface. (2) Plin2-C1 (Figure B) and
Plin2-C2 (Figure C) expressing cells exhibited
partial targeting to lipid droplets, resulting in diminished lipid
droplet number as compared to cells expressing full-length protein
or Plin2-I. (3) Plin2-N2 (Figure E) also showed
partial lipid droplet targeting but diminished number of lipid droplets
as compared Plin2-C1 or -C2 expression cells. (4) In contrast, Plin2-N1
(Figure D) showed no targeting and the least
amount of lipid droplets. These results suggested that Plin2 lipid
droplet targeting was closely related to the amount of lipid droplets
produced. Second, in expression clones that targeted to lipid droplets,
FRET analysis was performed as described in previous work, to ascertain if the Cy5-labeled proteins and the NBD-cholesterol
(ligand) are in close proximity for binding. With appropriate choice
of fluorescent probes, FRET detects direct interactions at the molecular
level when the donor and acceptor are in within distances of 10–100
Å. FRET was observed between NBD-cholesterol (donor) and Cy5-labeled
Plin2 (acceptor) by measuring the amount of increase in donor intensity
after acceptor photobleaching. The calculation of the FRET efficiency
(E), a measure of the extent of probe overlap, was
determined as 25 ± 5 (Table ), values
consistent with efficient overlap of electronic states and direct
interaction of NBD-cholesterol and Plin2 on the lipid droplet surface.
The FRET efficiency represents a mean interaction distance of 1.20R0. Using the calculated Förster radius, R0 = 56 Å, the mean interaction distance
was calculated as 67 ± 4 Å, indicating close proximity (Table ). In a similar fashion, FRET was performed with
NBD-cholesterol and the Cy5-labeled deletion mutants to show FRET
occurred between the NBD-labeled ligand and the following deletion
mutants: Plin2-C1, Plin2-C2, and Plin2-I with R values
ranging from 85 to 96 Å (Table ). No
FRET was observed with Plin2-N1 or Plin2-N2. Taken together, these
findings were consistent with results from the binding studies and
indicated that Plin2 and several of the deletion mutants directly
interacted with NBD-cholesterol on the lipid droplet surface.

Confocal microscopy
colocalization of NBD-cholesterol and Cy5-labeled cells expressing
Plin2 and the deletion mutants. Colocalization experiments of NBD-cholesterol
and Cy5-labeled L cells overexpressing Plin2 (A), Plin2-C1 (B), Plin2-C2
(C), Plin2-N1 (D), Plin2-N2 (E), or Plin2-I (F) were performed as
described in the  section.
Images were acquired sequentially and fluorescence emission was detected
upon 488 nm excitation and 500/100 band path emission filter for NBD-cholesterol
(green channel) and 635 nm excitation with a 725/30 band path filter
for the Cy5 emission (red channel). Images derived from the red and
green channels were combined and appeared as yellow to orange where
superimposition of images derived from the red and green channels
overlapped.

(ND) in Plin2-N1 or Plin2-N2 expression cells. Values reflect mean

from 20 to 30 cells. Intracellular targeting indicated localization
sites of Cy5-Plin2 (red) and NBD-cholesterol (green) where yellow-to-orange
indicated colocalization of the probes.

Circular Dichroic Analysis of ADRP and Deletion Mutants
To further examine how structure affects function, the secondary
structures of Plin2 and the deletion mutants were analyzed by circular
dichroism (CD) both with and without ligand (cholesterol and stearic
acid). In the absence of ligand, the CD spectrum for full-length Plin2
(Figure A, solid line) showed a double minimum
at ∼208 and 222 nm signifying the presence of substantial amounts
of α-helices. The molar ellipticity was slightly lower at 208
nm than at 222 nm, however, indicating a significant amount of unordered
structure or random coil. A similar trend was visible in the spectra
for Plin2-N1 and Plin2-N2 before addition of ligand (Figure D,E, solid lines). In contrast, the CD spectra for
deletion mutants Plin2-C1, Plin2-C2, and Plin2-I (Figure B,C,F, solid lines) showed a fairly well balanced
molar ellipticity at both wavelengths along with a strong positive
peak at 190–200 nm, indicating that these mutants had less
unordered structure and retained strong α-helical character.
These results were supported when the data were analyzed using CDSSTR
software. Quantitative analysis of multiple CD spectra revealed that
deletion mutants Plin2-C1, Plin2-C2, and Plin2-I exhibited the lowest
proportion of unordered structure (29%, 29%, and 31%, respectively)
and high α-helicity (Table ). Similar
results were shown by SELCON2 analysis (data not shown).

Circular dichroic
analysis of Plin2 and the deletion mutants. Far ultraviolet (UV) circular
dichroic (CD) spectra of Plin2 (A), Plin2-C1 (B), Plin2-C2 (C), Plin2-N1
(D), Plin2-N2 (E), and Plin2-I (F) was shown in the presence or absence
of ligand (cholesterol or stearic acid, 5 μM). Solid line indicates
protein without ligand. Spectral trace designated by closed circles
indicates protein incubated with cholesterol; open circle indicates
protein incubated with stearic acid. Each spectrum represents an average
of 10 scans repeated in triplicate.

Further analysis
of the secondary structure of Plin2 showed that Plin2 contained 21.8%
α-helices and 24.5% β-strands based on analysis by CDSSTR
analysis (Table ) with similar results observed
with SELCON3 analysis (data not shown). A comparison of the secondary
structure of Plin2 to that of each deletion mutant showed that Plin2-C1
and Plin2-C2 had a higher percentage of α-helices (regular and
distorted) than Plin2. These results were consistent with secondary
structure predictions (Figure A) since Plin2-C1
contained the 4-helix bundle (α6, α7, α8, α9)
and Plin2-C2 contained α7, α8, α9, giving them the
highest α-helical percentage within the group. In contrast,
the other three deletion mutants Plin2-I, Plin2-N1, and Plin2-N2 exhibited
less α-helical structure than full-length Plin2 based on both
methods of analysis with results showing a respective 16.4%, 10.5%,
and 16.5% α-helical structure (regular and distorted). The percentage
of β-sheets (regular and distorted) was also significantly higher
in Plin2 (24.5%) when compared to Plin2-C1 (11.5%) and Plin2-C2 (19.1%)
but significantly less than Plin2-I (30.2%), Plin2-N1 (40%), or Plin2-N2
(27.2%). Results from CDSSTR analysis showed that Plin2 had significantly
more β-turns (21.8%) than Plin2-C2 (19.1%) but less than Plin2-N2
(23.4%). There were no significant differences between Plin2-C1, Plin2-I
(19.3%), and Plin2-N1. In summary, in the absence of ligand, the C-terminal
region of Plin2 (residues 119–436) exhibited a strong α-helical
character with less unordered structure as compared to the full-length
protein or mutants containing the N-terminal region (residues 1–119).
Alternatively, the N-terminal region of the protein contained significantly
more unordered structure than the C-terminal region.

The effect
of ligand binding on secondary structure was also examined. The addition
of cholesterol (Figure A, closed circles)
and stearic acid (Figure A, open circles)
altered the shape of the CD spectrum of full-length Plin2, intensifying
the minima at 208 nm with cholesterol but diminishing the peak when
stearic acid was present. These alterations were reflected by significant
changes in the percent composition of α-helical structures where
an increase and decrease respectively was observed when cholesterol
and stearic acid were added to the protein. With the deletion mutants,
subtle changes in the CD spectra were also observed upon addition
of ligands. As with the full-length protein, the CD spectrum of Plin2-C1
showed a significant increase in the intensity of the 208 nm minimum
when cholesterol was added but a significant decrease upon addition
of stearic acid, reflecting significant increases in both disordered
helices and unordered structures while decreasing the percentage of β-sheets
(Figure B, Table ).
Subtle conformational changes in the CD spectra were also observed
with Plin2-C2, Plin2-I, and Plin2-N2 upon ligand addition, reflecting
significant changes in percentage of α-helices and β-sheets
based on CDSSTR analysis (Table ). All three
mutants exhibited significant decreases in α-helical structure
when cholesterol was added, concomitant with significant increases
in β-sheet and unordered structure (Table ). In summary, the CD results were consistent with the predicted
secondary structure (Figure ) and indicated
that several of the proteins were sensitive to ligand binding. Lack
of conformational change upon ligand binding with deletion mutant
Plin2-N1 was consistent with results from the binding studies which
indicated that this mutant did not bind cholesterol or stearic acid.
Interestingly, the decrease in signal, along with the increase in
unordered structure upon addition of stearate, was indicative of a
more flexible binding pocket that does not enhance the secondary structure
of Plin2. Conversely, addition of cholesterol enhanced CD signal and
increased the percentage of α-helical character. This increase
in structured secondary structure suggests that binding of cholesterol
was dependent on a defined secondary structure.

The Tertiary
Structure of the Plin2 C-Terminal Domain Defines a Cleft That Can
Interact Favorably with Stearic Acid and Cholesterol
The
tertiary structure of Plin2 (Figure A) was
modeled by using two comparative modeling approaches. Homology modeling
by Modeler (web server: http://salilab.org/modweb) was employed for the C-terminal domain based on its sequence similarity
to Plin3, since this technique provides the most accurate structural
models. Modeler constructed a homology model of the structure of C-terminal
residues 190–409 of murine Plin2 (Figure A) based on its alignment with murine Plin3 (also known as TIP47)
with 38% sequence identity, well above the 25% threshold required
for confident homology modeling. In the
absence of a structural template with high enough sequence similarity
to the N-terminal region of Plin2 to allow homology modeling, the
next most accurate approach, fold recognition, was used. This approach
defines the best-matching structural template in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) based on the compatibility of the query sequence with the
primary and secondary structure of the NMR or crystal structure being
evaluated as a template, and the favorability of the 3-dimensional
chemical interactions of each residue with its neighbors when modeled
using that particular 3-D structure. The Pcons.net (http://pcons.net) server was used to model residues 1–171 of murine Plin2
based on the consensus of predicted structures from 11 different fold
recognition methods. Of the 10 highest-consensus structural models
provided by Pcons, two corresponded to functionally relevant apolipoprotein
structures that form compact α-helical bundles: apolipophorin
III (PDB entry 1AEP, residues A6–A158); and apoliprotein
A-I (PDB entry 2A01, residues A44-A187. The apolipophorin-based
model for Plin2 was chosen based on having higher sequence identity
(20%, relative to 10% sequence identity for apolipoprotein A-I). Additionally,
the matched region of Plin2 corresponds to the entire helical bundle
structure of apolipophorin, including a fifth, irregular helix, as
shown in yellow in Figure A. This model is
consistent with previous studies suggesting N-terminal domain homology
with apolipoproteins., Together, the N-terminal apolipophorin
(left side of Figure A) and C-terminal Plin3-based
structural model (right side of Figure A)
cover all but the 18 linking residues between the two domains and
the 16 C-terminal residues of Plin2, which could not be modeled due
to lack of homology. A close sequence match in the PDB was found for
13 of the 18 linking residues in Plin2 (VDNAITKSELLVD) which
match residues A136–A153 in PDB entry 1E6B (VNNAITKGFTALEKLLVN),
forming an α helix. The central
residues FTAL in this known structure are an insertion corresponding
to a full turn of helix not found in the Plin2 sequence. Though the
matching sequence comes from a glutathione S-transferase,
which is unlikely to be a functional homologue of Plin2, an exact
match of 9/13 residues between these two peptides means they are statistically
likely to fold the same, as an α helix as previously described. Thus, the C-terminus (yellow sphere at bottom
center of Figure a) of the apolipophorin-like
domain and the N-terminus (blue sphere) of the Plin3 domain may well
be connected by a helical linker. The model presented here is consistent
with the solution based structures for Plin3 described by Hynson et
al., who show the Plin3 C-terminal domain as one-half of an elongated
structure. Their volumetric profile is
consistent with end-to-end packing of the N-terminal and C-terminal
domains in the Plin3 solution structure.

Plin2 has an apophorin-like
N-terminal domain and a Plin3-like C-terminal domain containing a
potential lipid binding cleft. The N-terminal domain structure of
Plin2 (residues 1–171; shown in yellow ribbons) was modeled
using the n-fold fold recognition server via Pcons,
based on the high degree of Plin2 sequence and secondary structural
compatibility with the three-dimensional structure of apolipophorin
III (PDB entry 1AEP), and this model’s consensus with the top-scoring results
from 11 other fold recognition predictions for the N-terminal Plin2
sequence, all of which are α-helical bundles. This structure
contains five helices connected by turns in a compact bundle. This
model for the N-terminal 171 residues of Plin2 received a Pcons consensus
score of 0.77, indicating a high degree of shared features with the
top-scoring models from the different fold recognition methods. A
value of 0.77 corresponds to 98% sensitivity (meaning 98% of the proteins
of similar fold are predicted correctly) and 94% specificity (meaning
that 94% of proteins with dissimilar folds will not be incorrectly
assigned as similar in fold). The homology model of the C-terminal
domain of Plin2 appears to the right in panel (a), based on its 38%
sequence identity with the crystal structure of the corresponding
region in Plin3 (residues 191–437, PDB entry 1SZI). The structure
contains a 4-helix bundle (cyan, green, orange, and red helices),
which together with an α–β domain (blue, magenta,
and light gray) form the cleft. Stearic acid (the U-shaped light blue-colored
stick figure, with carboxylate oxygens in red) is shown positioned
in this cleft, based on the most energetically favorable binding mode
predicted by SLIDE. Cleft residues include
Val203, Tyr215, Ala233, Arg236, Val237, Ala240, Thr325, Val326, Asn329,
Gln331, Trp398, Leu399, Val400, Pro402, and Phe403. (b) ConSurf analysis
of residue conservation in the perilipin family, color-mapped onto
the surface of the Plin2 C-terminal domain. The position of the cleft
is indicated by the predicted binding mode for stearic acid (light
blue stick figure). Dark blue to green surface indicates the most
highly and next most highly conserved residues in perilipins mapped
onto the Plin2 structure, and yellow to red indicate increasingly
low conservation. (c) Atom-colored surface representation of the same
region in Plin2 (green for carbon, blue for nitrogen, and red for

to the predicted position of the carboxylate group in stearic acid.

ConSurf multiple-sequence alignment of 38 diverse proteins
in the Plin family yielded conservation values for each residue, which
were color-mapped onto the surface of the Plin2 C-terminal domain
structure and defined a cleft region (Figure b). In the model, blue identified highly conserved residues with
a gradient toward green, yellow, orange and red indicating decreasing
chemical conservation. The Plin2 model was also colored by atom type,
with blue for nitrogen atoms, green for carbon, and red for oxygen
atoms (Figure c). In both models the most
favorable mode of stearic acid interaction with the cleft was predicted
by SLIDE molecular docking to reveal
5613 favorable conformers of stearic acid generated by Omega2, including
protein side-chain and ligand single-bond rotations for steric complementarity
between stearic acid and Plin2. The result was an orientation of stearic
acid and conformation of Plin2 side chains that yielded a favorable
predicted ΔGbinding (−7.5
kcal/mol). The resulting orientation of stearic acid matches a highly
conserved surface patch in Plin2 (blue region, Figure b), as well as placing the terminal carboxylate group of stearic
acid within favorable distance of conserved hydrogen-bonding groups,
including the Arg236 guanidinium on helix α6, the side-chain
amines of Asn329 (helix α6) and Trp398 (β4), and the main-chain
nitrogen of Gly401 (β4), all absolutely conserved between Plin2
and Plin3. Since some of the deletion mutants (e.g., Plin2-N2 or Plin2-C2)
remove several residues contributing to the cleft, the stearic acid
binding orientation would likely differ in those cases. In fact, Plin2-C2
most likely retains lipid binding ability despite the lack of key
structural features of the cleft domain (helix α4, the α–β
domain, and part of helix α6) due to retention of interacting
residues including Asn329, Trp398 (β4), and Gly401. Docking
of cholesterol into the same cleft (Figure d) resulted in greater predicted affinity of binding (−9.6
kcal/mol) relative to steric acid. Cholesterol formed interactions
with several residues including Val205, Phe208, Val211, the aliphatic
part of Lys213, and Tyr217 in the α–β domain, Thr325
and Val328 in helix α7, and Pro402 in strand β4. Hydrophobic
contacts were also made with the collar region created by the conserved
residues identified in Plin3. Since these
residues are conserved between Plin2 and Plin3, similar lipid interactions
are also possible in Plin3.

Discussion
Previous
studies demonstrated that Plin2 binds lipids with high affinity− and is involved in lipid droplet formation, triacylglycerol accumulation,− fatty acid uptake, and
lipoprotein regulation., Despite these findings, little
is known regarding the structural and functional requirements of Plin2–lipid
interactions that facilitate these processes. To address this issue,
truncated Plin2 mutants were designed to contain one or more predicted
domains conserved among the Plin protein family to identify structural
motifs required for Plin2 lipid binding. Studies herein provide the
following new insights. First, the N-terminal PAT domain is not involved
in lipid binding since the Plin2-N1 mutant (containing the PAT domain)
showed no evidence of binding lipids. These results are consistent
with earlier studies that give evidence that the PAT domain is involved
in other roles including lipid droplet stabilization, lipid accumulation,
and proteasomal degradation of Plin2. Second, Plin2 residues 119–251, containing helix α4,
the α–β domain, and part of helix α6 form
a Plin3-like cleft found to be important for highest affinity lipid
binding. This follows from findings that mutants containing residues
119–251 (Plin2-C1 and Plin2-N2) showed the highest affinity
for cholesterol and stearic acid ligands, while those lacking these
residues exhibited the least (Plin2-C2) or no (Plin2-N1) lipid binding.
With Plin2-C2, NBD-stearate and NBD-cholesterol binding decreased
up to 9-fold when compared to the full-length protein and more than
3-fold when compared to Plin2-C1, resulting in a protein that still
targeted to lipid droplets but with the lowest affinity of all the
mutants that showed binding. Results finding residues 119–251
important to binding are not surprising, since the region includes
structures found in the X-ray crystal of Plin3 that form a cleft of
sufficient size to accommodate lipid ligands. In addition, other work shows that the region of Plin2 within residues
119–426 is able to fold and function independently from the
rest of the protein. Some of the residues
within the cleft region, however, are not entirely essential for lipid
binding since removal of the α–β domain (residues
171–219) resulted in a mutant (Plin2-I) with similar binding
affinity to that of the full-length protein. It should also be noted
that affinities for the two ligands (cholesterol and stearic acid)
were distinctly different. For example, Plin2-I showed a 3-fold decrease
in NBD-cholesterol binding as compared to the full-length protein,
but with NBD-stearic acid no significant change in binding was observed.
The results suggest that Plin2 has slightly different determinants
for cholesterol and stearic acid binding. For instance, the proposed
lipid binding site in the C-terminal domain (Figure ) has some shared interactions for cholesterol and stearic
acid binding, but different footprints due to the different chemical
structures of the individual ligands. Consistent with this, Plin2
is known to support binding to an array of lipids with diverse structures
such as phospholipids, sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and fatty acids.− In the present study, we show for the first time that Plin2 binds
polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid, a ω6
fatty acid that is precursor to several families of pro-inflammatory
eicosanoid lipid mediators, and DHA, a ω3 fatty acid associated
with anti-inflammatory benefits, with high affinity (Kd = 22 ± 1 nM and 46 ± 6 nM, respectively). These results
suggest that lipid droplets may act as physiological stores for essential
fatty acids. In addition, since Plin2 binds arachidonic acid with
2.1-fold higher affinity than DHA and close to 4-fold higher affinity
than stearic acid, these findings support Plin2 selectively sequestering
proinflammatory fatty acids to the lipid droplet surface. Consistent
with this, arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids have been detected
on lipid droplets that colocalize with Plin2.

Discrete targeting
of the Plin2 mutants to lipid droplets was also demonstrated. Deletion
mutants Plin2-N1, containing residues 1–119 (the PAT domain)
and Plin2-N2, comprised of residues 1–251 (the PAT domain,
helix α4, α5-β3 domain, part of helix α6)
did not target to lipid droplets or show FRET interactions, consistent
with earlier work demonstrating that N-terminal deletion mutants containing
residues 1–131 were not found on lipid droplets., Addition of 52 residues to the PAT domain salvaged targeting ability
in previous studies,, suggesting the presence of a
lipid droplet targeting domain in the central region of the protein.
With regard to C-terminal mutants, both Plin2-C1 (containing residues
119–426) and Plin2-C2 (residues 251–426) targeted to
lipid droplets, consistent with previous reports., However, removal of residues 154–174 in other studies showed lack of targeting, while exclusion of
residues 172–218 in the present work resulted in a protein
that targeted lipid droplets and interacted with NBD-cholesterol in
FRET assays. Despite some inconsistencies between reports, these results
reinforce the idea that Plin2 contains two independent, nonoverlapping
targeting domains in its internal and C-terminal sequence that need
consideration of the tertiary structure to understand their structure.
Likewise, the fluorescence binding data supported that the ligand
binding site of Plin2 is not dictated by a linear structural motif
within the primary sequence. Much like the regions required for lipid
droplet targeting, domains involved in forming the lipid binding pocket
of the protein come from noncontiguous parts of the protein. This
motivated the modeling of Plin2 tertiary structure to understand how
these regions organize into functional lipid binding and targeting
domains. The tertiary structure of Plin2 was modeled using Modeler
and Pcons, also providing insights into the differences in ligand
binding affinities among the mutant proteins. Comparative modeling
revealed the Plin2 tertiary structure contained an apolipophorin III-like
N-terminal domain and a TIP47-like C-terminal domain, which were linked
by 18 residues. Consistent with earlier predictions and X-ray crystal
data for the most similar proteins, the modeled N-terminal domain
is likely to form an α-helical bundle,, while the C-terminal domain contained a highly conserved cleft formed
from the union of the α–β domain and the 4-helix
bundle with high homology to the corresponding crystal structure of
this region in Plin3. ConSurf multiple-sequence
alignment identified highly conserved residues within the Plin family
which localize to the cleft. SLIDE molecular docking revealed favorable conformers of stearic acid and cholesterol
interaction in the cleft region. Key residues predicted to interact
with stearic acid included Trp398, Gly401, and two residues in helix
α6, Arg236 and Asn329 that are conserved between Plin2 and Plin3,
suggesting conservation of function. Cholesterol formed interactions
with several residues in the same region as stearic acid including
Val205, Phe208, Val211, Lys213, and Tyr217. However, cholesterol also
interacted with residues Thr325 and Val328 in helix α7, and
Pro402 in strand β4 near the C-terminal end of the protein.
Orientations of stearic acid and cholesterol within the cleft were
favored energetically, with cholesterol predicted to have greater
affinity of binding relative to stearic acid (ΔGbinding of −9.6 kcal/mol versus −7.5 kcal/mol).
These results were consistent with experimental binding results that
showed Plin2 bound NBD-cholesterol with higher affinity than NBD-stearic
acid. Deletion mutants that remove residues contributing to the cleft
(e.g., Plin2-I) would also be expected to differ in binding interactions
and affinity, as was observed with the experimental data demonstrating
higher affinity for stearic acid than cholesterol with deletion mutant
Plin2-I and decreased affinity for cholesterol when compared to the
full-length protein. Moreover, Plin2-C2 is missing some structures
that form the cleft domain but retention of several interacting residues
(Asn329, Trp398, Gly401, Thr325, Val328, and Pro402) likely contributes
to its ability to bind both stearic acid and cholesterol, although
at decreased affinity. These results support that the predicted cleft
in the C-terminal region of Plin2 favorably binds lipids.

Structural
changes induced by mutation or ligand addition were also examined.
Plin2 in the absence of ligand was significantly helical. However,
the percentage of helical content doubled in the Plin-C1 and Plin-C2
mutants, in which the N-terminal domain and part or all of the α–β
domain were absent, suggesting that the C-terminal region is much
more strongly helical than the N-terminal region. These trends were
preserved in the presence of both cholesterol and stearic acid, suggesting
that ligand binding does not dissolve or nucleate helical structure
in Plin2. Consistent with these findings, Hynson et al. showed that
the C-terminal region of the homologous Plin3 protein was mostly α-helical
with little β-strand content. In
addition, the Plin3 N-terminal was found to increase the percentage
of amino acid residues forming β-strand, turns, and random coil. CD analysis of the Plin2 N-terminal region showed
similar results, despite the sequence-based prediction of predominantly
helical structure for the N-terminal half of the protein. One interpretation
of these results is that the N-terminal helices are less stable and
fluctuate more without the presence of lipid ligand or membrane. Indeed,
studies with the Plin3 protein show the N-terminal region is highly
elongated in solution, suggesting that Plin3 N-terminus becomes a
highly structured domain upon interaction with lipids or membrane. However, the Plin2 N-terminal domain may interact
differently, and these domain orientations could also change when
associated with a lipid droplet. It should be noted that conformational
change in another lipid droplet protein, Plin1 occurs upon hyperphosphorylation,
allowing access to lipids in the droplet.− This raises the question as to
whether the C-terminal domain of Plin2, containing the suggested binding
site for stearic acid and cholesterol, is likely to undergo a large-scale
rearrangement upon interacting with lipid droplets. Amphipathic α-helical
bundles with tightly packed hydrophobic cores, like that found in
Plin2, are not typically observed to alter conformation significantly
due to the considerable energy it would take to disrupt the extensive
favorable hydrophobic interactions within the core. Even the highly
hydrophobic helical bundles in integral membrane proteins like cytochrome
c oxidase typically only show coupled motion of helices rather than
any reorganization of interfaces. Viral
fusion with host membranes has been shown in some cases to depend
on the formation of helical bundles as a rate-limiting step. The same phenomenon has been observed for Hsp12
stress proteins, which are unfolded in the cytosol and then adopt
helical conformation upon interaction with the membrane. Because the helical bundles in Plin2 have polar
surfaces, however, it is hard to imagine any configuration or rearrangement
in which they could be favorably buried inside a lipid milieu. Thus,
association could be with the surface of the lipid droplet, through
interaction with polar headgroups, or by a tethering mechanism. Indeed
this was shown through a series of experiments by McManaman et al.
in which the polar surface of the helical bundles targeted to membranes
in nonionic solutions and were displaced as salt was added. These results further support that the 4-helix
bundle in the C-terminus of Plin2 can interact with polar headgroups
of the lipid droplet thereby binding and sequestering lipids.

Lipid droplet targeting was also associated with maintenance of the
helical regions in both the N- and C-terminal helical bundles, as
evidenced by Plin2 and Plin2-I being fully targeted to lipid droplets,
while the other mutants were partially or fully targeted to the cytoplasm.
Fluorescence binding and FRET results with labeled cholesterol support
strong interactions between cholesterol and the native Plin2 structure,
with weaker interactions with Plin2-C1, Plin2-C2, Plin2-I, and Plin2-N2
constructs. No evidence for cholesterol (or stearic acid) interaction
with Plin2-N1 was detected. These results support the crucial role
of the C-terminal helical bundle region of Plin2 that is homologous
to Plin3 for binding lipids; this region contains the conserved cleft.
Other recent reports support the functional importance of the Plin
family’s C-terminal regions., The C-terminal
region of Plin1 contains a C-terminal region, implicated in binding
AB-hydrolase domain containing-5 (ABHD5), a cofactor that prevents
the activation of adipose tissue triacylglycerol lipase. Patel et
al. demonstrated that fusing the carboxy
terminal region of Plin1 to the amino terminus of Plin2 was sufficient
to stabilize ABHD5 and suppress basal lipolysis. For Plin5, Sztalryd
et al. demonstrated that fusing the carboxy
terminal region of Plin5 to Plin2 generated a protein that was able
to recruit lipid droplets to mitochondria, whereas Plin2 by itself
did not. Our work supports specific lipid binding as a function for
the C-terminal region in Plin2.

In summary, the modeled tertiary
structure for Plin2 highlighted the structural and functional features
necessary for ligand binding and lipid droplet targeting. The PAT
domain was not required for lipid binding or lipid droplet targeting;
removal of this domain resulted in C-terminal mutants with high affinity
for lipids. Crucial elements contained within residues 119–251
in the C-terminal region include the central α–β
domain, along with the conserved end of helix α6, which form
part of the cleft region. Removal of these residues decreased binding
with cholesterol and stearic acid ligands several-fold. Evidence of
the functional relevance of this region was recently provided in studies
with a human Plin2 variant where a serine to proline mutation at residue
251 caused individuals with the minor allele to exhibit decreased
plasma triglyceride and decreased VLDL levels. Structurally, the mutation would be predicted to disrupt
helix α6. In the present work, both cholesterol and stearic
acid were shown through molecular docking experiments to interact
favorably with a cleft formed by conserved residues within the C-terminal
region, including helix α6. Furthermore, the modeled interactions
together with the mutant construct binding studies suggest that this
conserved cleft is a site of favorable lipid interaction for both
cholesterol and stearic acid.
