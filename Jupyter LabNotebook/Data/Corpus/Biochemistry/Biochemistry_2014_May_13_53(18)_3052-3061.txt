Stalling
of DNA replication
forks results from insufficient nucleotide precursors, damaged template
DNA, collisions between replisome and transcriptional complexes, or
difficult to replicate genomic regions., In some cases,
fork stalling leads to uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities,
generating an excess of RPA-coated ssDNA and activating the DNA damage
response (DDR). The DDR is mediated by ATM, ATR, and DNA-dependent
protein kinase activity and recruitment of a number of fork remodeling
and DNA repair proteins.

One such
protein is SMARCAL1, a SNF2 ATP-dependent fork remodeler
that facilitates rescue of stalled DNA replication forks.,− SMARCAL1 is activated by phosphorylation by ATR, and its deficiency
increases cellular sensitivity to replication stress agents and leads
to accumulation of ssDNA and double-strand breaks.,, Mutations in SMARCAL1 lead to the autosomal-recessive
pleiotropic disorder Schimke Immunoosseous Dysplasia (SIOD). SMARCAL1 is recruited to stalled forks through
a direct interaction with RPA. Binding
is mediated by the 32 N-terminal residues of SMARCAL1,,, which is homologous to previously
characterized RPA interaction motifs of the human uracil-DNA glycosylase
(UNG2), RAD52, XPA, and Timeless-interacting protein (TIPIN).,, In addition to localizing SMARCAL1
to damaged forks, RPA enforces a preference of SMARCAL1 for ssDNA
regions on the leading strand template.

RPA is the predominant eukaryotic single-stranded DNA binding
protein
and essential for virtually all DNA transactions, including the DDR., RPA protects ssDNA from nucleases and prevents the formation of
aberrant structures and reannealing,− while also serving as a scaffold
that links the substrate to the succession of enzymes that process
the DNA. RPA is a modular heterotrimer composed of 70, 32, and 14
kDa subunits that together contain seven globular domains and one
disordered domain (Figure ). Binding of ssDNA
is mediated by four OB-fold domains: the RPA70A, -70B, and -70C domains
and the RPA32D domain. In addition to binding ssDNA, RPA interacts
with numerous DNA-processing proteins.,,− These interactions have been
mapped by our laboratory and others to the RPA70N, -70A, -70B, and
-32C domains.,,− The RPA70N and -32C domains are the primary mediators
of protein interactions., RPA32C serves as the
primary contact point for multiple DDR and repair proteins, including
XPA, UNG2, RAD52, TIPIN, and SMARCAL1.,,,− Although RPA32C is known to recruit SMARCAL1 through an N-terminal
RBM, the details and strength of this RPA32C–SMARCAL1 interaction
are not known.

We report here the characterization of the RPA32C–SMARCAL1
interface at the molecular level. The X-ray crystal structure of RPA32C
was determined, and the interaction with SMARCAL1-RBM peptides was
characterized by isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism
(CD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and computational
modeling. These results provide insight into the molecular basis for
the recruitment of SMARCAL1 to stalled replication forks and how the
interaction of DDR and repair proteins with RPA32C is fine-tuned by
the selection of residues at the binding interface.

Methods
RPA32C Expression
and Purification
The previously reported
RPA32C construct, RPA32172–270, was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 and purified as described previously. The optimized RPA32C construct, RPA32202–270, was cloned into pBG100 (Vanderbilt Center for Structural Biology)
and transformed into BL21-DE3 cells (New England Biolabs) for expression.
Overnight cultures were prepared from single colonies and used to
inoculate 1 L of Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. The cultures were grown
at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.5–0.6, at which time
isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added
to a final concentration of 1 mM and cultures were grown for an additional
5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in buffer
A [50 mM Hepes, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME), and
10 mM imidazole (pH 7.5)]. The supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-NTA Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer
A and washed with buffer A. Following elution with buffer B [50 mM
Hepes, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM BME, and 250 mM imidazole (pH 7.5)], (His)6-tagged H3C protease was added to the eluate and the mixture
dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer A and subjected to
Ni2+-NTA chromatography to remove the cleaved (His)6 tag. The RPA32202–270 protein obtained
was &gt;95% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis analysis. The production of 15N-labeled
RPA32172–270 and RPA32202–270 for
NMR studies was performed using the same protocols except that cells
were grown in M9 medium containing 0.5 g of 15NH4Cl per liter as the sole nitrogen source.

SMARCAL1-RBM Expression
and Purification
The cDNA encoding
SMARCAL1 residues 1–32 containing the RBM was cloned into pBG101
(Vanderbilt Center for Structural Biology) and the protein expressed
in E. coli BL21-DE3 cells as an N-terminally tagged
(His)6-GST fusion containing an H3C protease recognition
sequence. SMARCAL11–32 was expressed and purified
as described above for RPA32202–270, with an additional
S75 gel filtration (Amersham) step in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 75 mM NaCl,
5 mM DTT buffer. The SMARCAL17–32 peptide was purchased
from Genescript at &gt;95% purity as determined by high-performance
liquid
chromatography and used without further purification.

Isothermal
Titration Calorimetry
RPA32172–270 and
SMARCAL11–32 were exchanged into a buffer
containing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT,
and ITC data were acquired using a MicroCal VP isothermal titration
calorimeter. An initial injection of 2 μL of 800 μM SMARCAL11–32 into 60 μM RPA32172–270 in the sample cell was followed by additional 10 μL injections.
The data were analyzed using the Origin software provided by MicroCal.
The binding constant (Kd) and thermodynamic
parameters were calculated from the average of three separate titrations
by fitting the data to a single-site binding model using nonlinear
least-squares fitting.

X-ray Crystallography
RPA32C202–270 (RPA32C) was dialyzed into a buffer containing
20 mM Tris (pH 7.5)
and concentrated to 15 mg/mL. Crystals were observed by hanging drop
vapor diffusion at 21 °C from drops containing a 1:1 ratio of
RPA32C and 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and 20% PEG 3350. Initial
attempts to crystallize the protein were not successful, and crystals
were obtained only after the protein was dialyzed against the low-ionic
strength buffer. Following optimization of pH and PEG concentration,
hexagonal crystals were obtained and grew to full size in ∼3
days. Prior to data collection, MPD was added to a final concentration
of 20% and crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction
data were collected at sector 21 (Life Sciences Collaborative Access
Team, LS-CAT) of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL). All data
were processed with HKL-2000. RPA32C
crystallized in space group P65 and contained
one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Initial phases were obtained
by molecular replacement with PHASER using
the NMR structure of RPA32C [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1DPU] as a search model.
Iterative cycles of model building and refinement were performed using
COOT and PHENIX., The structure was deposited in
the PDB as entry 4OU0. PyMOL (Schrödinger) was used for structure visualization
and analysis. Data collection and structure refinement statistics
are listed in Table S1 of the .

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR studies were performed on
Bruker Advance III 500 or 600 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with
5 mm single-axis z gradient inverse cryogenic probes.
Spectra were recorded using band-selective, optimized flip angle short
transient, 15N–1H heteronuclear multiple-quantum
coherence (SOFAST-HMQC) spectra. Spectra
were recorded with 1024 data points in the direct proton, 96 points
in the indirect nitrogen dimension, and a recycle delay of 200 ms.
All data were processed and analyzed with NMRpipe and Sparky (University of San Francisco, San Francisco,
CA). The previously assigned backbone 1H and 15N NMR chemical shifts for RPA32172–270 were transferred
to RPA32C.

NMR spectra were acquired
at 25 °C in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0) with
75 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT. The concentration of [15N]RPA32C
was adjusted to 250 μM for titrations with the SMARCAL1 peptides.
Data points were collected at SMARCAL1 concentrations of 0, 20, 60,
120, 200, 360, and 600 μM. Titrations of 250 μM [15N]SMARCAL1 were performed with RPA32C at concentrations of
0, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μM. The chemical shift perturbations
in a titration of labeled RPA32C with SMARCAL17–32 were analyzed using a weighted average of the change in chemical
shift (Δδ) upon binding based on the net perturbations
in both the 1H and 15N dimensions calculated
using the standard equation (eq ):For in situ proteolysis experiments,
1 μL of Proteinase K (Clontech) dissolved at a ratio of 1/100
(w/v) was added to NMR samples and SOFAST-HMQC spectra were collected
at 10 min intervals. The starting concentration in these experiments
was 200 μM [15N]RPA32172–270 or
250 μM [15N]SMARCAL11–32.

CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra of RPA32C, SMARCAL17–32, and SMARCAL17–32-bound RPA32C
were collected using a Jasco J-810 spectrometer outfitted with a Peltier
temperature control module. All spectra were collected at 25 °C
in 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) buffer containing 75 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT.
Spectra were collected using a 2 nm bandwidth at 1 nm intervals with
each data point averaged for 5 s. The RPA32C and SMARCAL17–32 concentrations were 15 and 20 μM, respectively.

Homology Modeling
Homology models were generated using
Modeler version 9.13,− the HEX (http://hexserver.loria.fr/) server, and the RosettaDock server (http://rosie.rosettacommons.org/docking)− using default settings. The structure of RPA32C in complex with
the UNG2 peptide (PDB entry 1DPU) was used as a template
for Modeler and RosettaDock. Our structure of RPA32C and a Pymol-generated
SMARCAL17–32 α-helix were used for docking
with HEX.

Results
Interaction of the SMARCAL1
RPA Binding Motif with RPA32C
The primary interaction of
SMARCAL1 with RPA has been previously
mapped to a motif in the N-terminal region (SMARCAL1-RBM) and the
C-terminal globular domain of the RPA32 subunit (RPA32C).,, The interaction was identified
by pull-down assays, but the affinity of the interaction was not quantified.
Here, we employed isothermal titration calorimetery (ITC) to measure
the affinity of RPA32172–270 for SMARCAL1-RBM (Figure ). A dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 ± 0.1 μM was measured, which was stronger
than all previously characterized interactions of RPA32C with target
protein fragments except for that with TIPIN, which was measured to
be 0.5 μM. Binding of SMARCAL1-RBM
to RPA32C was exothermic, suggesting that multiple hydrogen bonds
are formed when the two molecules interact.

μM RPA32172–270 in the cell and 10 μL
additions of 800 μM SMARCAL11–32.

Optimization of the RPA32C Construct by Limited
Proteolysis
The solution NMR structure of RPA32C in complex
with a UNG2 peptide
was determined previously using a 99-residue RPA32172–270 construct. However, in this construct,
only the 67 C-terminal residues formed the globular RPA32C domain
and no residues outside of this domain were involved in binding to
target proteins. Assuming that the flexible disordered N-terminal
residues are not needed for binding and would inhibit crystallization,
we set out to identify the minimal RPA32C fragment that retains folding
and binding activity. To this end, we took advantage of the NMR assignments
available for RPA32172–270 and performed limited proteolysis in situ (in the
NMR tube). This allowed us to determine how many N-terminal residues
lie outside of the globular core. The NMR chemical shift is a highly
sensitive, residue-specific probe of structure and binding. The use
of two-dimensional 15N–1H NMR correlation
spectroscopy allowed us to monitor the backbone amides of RPA32C and
follow the cleavage of the disordered N-terminal residues as they
were digested by Proteinase K. This protease was chosen because there
are a number of consensus cleavage sites within the residues outside
of the globular RPA32C core.

The series of RPA32172–270 spectra acquired prior to and after incubation with Proteinase K
(Figure A) shows that 30 residues disappeared
from the spectrum as they were cleaved by the protease. The peak for
residue A202 was the most N-terminal residue that could be identified
as having only very little change in peak position and intensity.
Hence, this residue was chosen as the N-terminus of a new RPA32C202–270 construct. To confirm that the globular core
was not affected by the truncation, we compared the two-dimensional
(2D) 15N–1H correlation spectra of [15N]RPA32202–270 and RPA32172–270 (Figure B). The data show that there are
only very minor perturbations in chemical shifts. Thus, truncation
of the N-terminus to A202 did not disrupt folding of the globular
RPA32C domain.

High-Resolution X-ray Crystal
Structure of RPA32C
The
crystal structure of the optimized RPA32C202–270 construct (hereafter RPA32C) was determined by molecular replacement
using the NMR structure of RPA32C extracted from the coordinates of
the UNG2 complex (PDB entry 1DPU) as a search model. The
crystallographic model was refined against diffraction data extending
to 1.4 Å resolution (Table S1 of the ). We note that RPA32C was soluble under all sparse
matrix conditions examined at concentrations up to 40 mg/mL under
standard buffer conditions, and crystals could be obtained only by
drastically lowering the ionic strength of the buffer.

As anticipated,
the RPA32C crystal structure reveals the same three-helix bundle capped
by a β-hairpin that is observed in the NMR structure of RPA32172–270 determined in the presence of a peptide fragment
of UNG2 (Figure A). Almost all of the noticeable
differences between the structures are in loops (Figure C), which are presumably somewhat more flexible than the globular
core. Overall, the structures are very similar; for example, the Cα
atom root-mean-square deviation is only 0.57 Å. Further comparisons
of the structures for the free protein and the complex reveal that
the binding of targets requires only minor conformational adjustments.
These comparisons also support the proposal of a significant electrostatic
contribution to binding from the acidic target binding surface (Figure B). The similarity between the RPA32C structures
in the absence and presence of the target peptide also extends to
the positions of critical RPA32C side chains, which need not reorient
to bind the UNG2 peptide (Figure C) or presumably
other target proteins.

of side chains of RPA32C are highlighted, corresponding to those residues
in the structure of the complex within 3.5 Å of the UNG2 peptide.

Structural Analysis of
the SMARCAL1–RPA32C Complex
Multiple-sequence alignment
of SMARCAL1 suggests its RPA32C binding
motif is similar to that of XPA, UNG2, Rad52, and TIPIN.,, In previous studies of the interactions
of peptide fragments of these target proteins, the peptides were found
to undergo a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding., To determine if this was the case for SMARCAL1, CD spectra were
collected for free RPA32C, free SMARCAL11–32, and
the complex (Figure ). All three exhibited
CD spectra with pronounced double minima at 208 and 222 nm indicating
the presence of α-helical secondary structure. To determine
if binding to RPA32C induced formation of additional helical content
in SMARCAL11–32, the CD spectra of RPA32C and SMARCAL11–32 were summed and compared to the spectrum of their
complex. A clear difference is seen in optical ellipticity at 222
nm between the summed spectra and the spectrum of the complex (Figure ), suggesting a 20% increase in α-helical
content upon binding of SMARCAL11–32 to RPA32C.
This change in helical content is supported by the increased level
of dispersion in the 1H dimension and the appearance of
six new amide cross-peaks in the 2D 15N–1H NMR spectrum of [15N]SMARCAL11–32 upon
addition of unlabeled RPA32C (Figure A). Together,
these data indicate that the binding of SMARCAL11–32 to RPA32C induces a disorder-to-helix transition in SMARCAL1 similar
to that induced in UNG2 and TIPIN upon binding to RPA32C.,

Because the peptide fragments
of XPA, UNG2, and Rad52 in our previous
studies consisted of ∼20 residues, we hypothesized that the
SMARCAL1–RPA32C binding site is similar in size and therefore
not all 32 residues of SMARCAL11–32 were required
for binding to RPA32C. Multiple-sequence alignment of the RPA32C binding
motifs from XPA, UNG2, Rad52, and TIPIN (Figure ) suggested SMARCAL112–27 forms the core of the
binding site. To determine the minimal SMARCAL1 peptide needed to
bind RPA32C, we again performed limited proteolysis in an NMR tube
with the protease Proteinase K. Similar to our experiment with free
RPA32C, addition of Proteinase K resulted in a progressive loss of
peak intensity for a select number of [15N]SMARCAL11–32 amide cross-peaks, and a number of SMARCAL1 peaks
were protected from proteolysis (Figure B).
Even though resonance assignments for [15N]SMARCAL11–32 were not available, these data were sufficient
to infer that a fragment of ∼25 residues remained bound to
RPA32C, supporting our hypothesis that a shorter SMARCAL1 peptide
could be designed (Figure B). On the basis
of the data and alignments, we selected SMARCAL1 residues 7–32.

Sequence
alignment of RPA32C target interaction motifs. The asterisks
above the SMARCAL1-RMB sequence identify the SMARCAL1-RBM residues
in contact with RPA32C in our RosettaDock model. Residues colored
green and red represent those that are conserved and highly conserved,
respectively. The residues corresponding to the critical alanine residue
at position 14 in SMARCAL1 are highlighted in bold. The box is drawn
to show the residues that correspond to the RPA32C binding region
in the NMR structure of the complex with UNG2. The two columns at
right list the pI values of all residues in the motif (pIall) and of only residues in the box (pIbox). The alignment
was generated using ClustalW.

To determine if this smaller fragment (hereafter
SMARCAL1-RBM)
bound to RPA32C in the same manner as SMARCAL11–32, a progressive series of complexes were analyzed by 2D 15N–1H NMR using [15N]RPA32172–270 and [15N]RPA32C titrated with SMARCAL11–32 and SMARCAL1-RBM (Figure A–C). The
first step was to determine chemical shift perturbations of RPA32172–270 induced by the binding of SMARCAL11–32 (Figure A). To compare the effect of reducing
the flexible N-terminal linker of RPA32C, the experiment was repeated
with RPA32C (Figure B). The comparison of
the two sets of spectra shows that SMARCAL11–32 induces
similar chemical shift perturbations, as reflected in the overlay
of the spectra obtained in the presence of the peptide (Figure D). Thus, truncation of the linker does not interfere
with the binding of SMARCAL11–32. The third step
of this analysis was to examine the chemical shift perturbations induced
in RPA32C by the truncated SMARCAL1-RBM identified from our proteolytic
digest (Figure C). To compare the effect of
removing the six N-terminal residues, the spectrum of RPA32C bound
to SMARCAL1-RBM was overlaid on the spectrum with SMARCAL11–32 (Figure E). The observation of similar chemical
shift perturbations shows that the smaller peptide binds at the same
site. A small number of minor differences are evident in Figure E, which we attribute to the different lengths of
the two SMARCAL1 peptides. Together, these data show that structural
analysis of the complex can be performed with RPA32C and SMARCAL1-RBM.

Deeper insight into how SMARCAL1-RBM interacts
with RPA32C was
obtained from an examination of the magnitude of the NMR chemical
shift perturbations in RPA32C induced by the binding of the peptide.
Using a cutoff of 0.24 ppm, a total of 15 residues were identified
as being significantly perturbed (Figure A).
The RPA32C residues exhibiting the greatest chemical shift change
upon binding of SMARCAL17–32 were T267, Y256, D268,
and T258. The chemical shift perturbations are mapped on the crystal
structure in Figure B. Notably, these RPA32C
residues correspond well to the residues closest to the UNG2 peptide
in the RPA32C complex (Figure C). This observation
provides additional support for the generation of structural models
of the RPA32C–SMARCAL1-RBM complex based on the homology to
the structure of the UNG2 complex and NMR chemical shift perturbation
data.

Three different approaches were utilized to independently
model
the RPA32C–SMARCAL1-RBM complex. First, a homology model of
the complex was directly generated using Modeler with the structure
of the RPA32C–UNG2 peptide complex as a template. The model
showed that SMARCAL1-RBM could be readily accommodated at the same
binding site in RPA32C as the UNG2 peptide, in particular, the formation
of an α-helix by the SMARCAL1 residues (14–27) directly
in the binding site. Notably, the remaining SMARCAL1 residues, 7–13
and 28–32, were disordered in this model because the algorithm
does not generate structural models for residues lacking the template
and only 17 residues in the UNG2 peptide are ordered. Next, the HEX
rigid-body docking server in conjunction with RPA32C NMR chemical
shift perturbations defining the SMARCAL1-RBM binding site were used
to perform a series of docking calculations using our RPA32C crystal
structure and a computationally generated α-helical model of
SMARCAL17–32. The critical finding from this docking
calculation is that SMARCAL1-RBM bound not only to the same surface
of RPA32C as the Modeler model but also with the same polarity and
register.

To enhance the quality of the model, we turned to
RosettaDock,
a Monte Carlo-based algorithm, to calculate the lowest-energy conformation
of the RPA32C–SMARCAL1-RBM complex.− Docking of
the peptide to the protein using cycles of random rigid-body perturbation
was performed followed by optimization of side chain conformations
using the complex of RPA32C with the UNG2 peptide (PDB entry 1DPU) as a template.
A total of 1000 independent models of the RPA32C–SMARCAL1-RBM
complex were generated and scored on the basis of van der Waals bonding,
hydrogen bonding, implicit Gaussian solvation, side chain rotamer
probabilities, and electrostatics.− Figure  shows the lowest-energy conformer from the ensemble of best
scoring RosettaDock models. Notably, the SMARCAL17–32 peptide adopted an α-helical conformation, through residues
not only in the RPA32C binding site but also throughout the entire
peptide. While our CD and NMR analyses support the disorder-to-helix
transition in the peptide, there is no direct evidence that the peptide
forms a stable helix throughout its whole length as suggested by this
model. Contacts of Structural Units analysis was used to assign contacts between RPA32C and the SMARCAL1-RBM
peptide (Figure ). The complex is seen to
have a number of complementary electrostatic interactions between
acidic residues of RPA32C (e.g., E252 and D258) and basic residues
in SMARCAL1-RBM (e.g., R17 and K19). Hydrophobic interactions are
also observed, including A20 in SMARCAL1-RBM, which contacts S250,
G253, I255, Y256, and T267 in RPA32C. These RPA32C residues also play
a key role in the hydrophobic interactions with XPA, UNG2, RAD52,
and TIPIN peptides.

Contacts of Structural Units analysis.

Discussion
The in situ proteolysis NMR method used here to
identify the optimal RPA32C construct length should be applicable
to other proteins with well-folded domains connected via flexible
linkers and provides an additional example of the complementarity
of NMR and X-ray crystallography. The crystal structure of free RPA32C
allowed the first detailed analysis of the conformation changes required
for target binding. Comparisons with the NMR structures of RPA32C
in complex with UNG2 and TIPIN reveal that in fact, target binding
requires only modest changes in the structure of RPA32C. The chemical
shift perturbation data reported here confirm that like other RPA32C
interaction partners, SMARCAL1 binds to the common RPA32C interface.
Our structural model is consistent with these data, suggesting that
there is little change in RPA32C structure outside of select side
chain rearrangements.

The structural model of SMARCAL1-RBM bound
to RPA32C is similar
to the experimentally determined structures of UNG2 and TIPIN bound
to RPA32C., As noted in our previous study,
the RPA32C binding interface is devoid of hydrophobic pockets typically
found at protein binding interfaces and, rather, is relatively flat. The importance of this characteristic is underscored
by the strong conservation of alanine at the position in the binding
motifs that contacts Y256 of RPA32C (Figure ). The flatness of the binding site combined with a modest burial
of hydrophobic surface (613.7 Å2 for the SMARCAL1-RBM)
suggests that additional molecular forces have significant roles in
molecular recognition of targets by RPA32C.

The contribution
of electrostatic interactions to the binding of
RPA32C targets is evident from the charge complementarity of the acidic
RPA32C binding surface and the presence of multiple basic residues
in the target binding motifs. Sequence
alignment with UNG2, XPA, RAD52, and TIPIN shows that SMARCAL1-RBM
is considerably less basic than other RPA32C binding partners because
of the incorporation of a number of glutamates between residues 7
and 15 (Figure ). Hence, we did not anticipate
the SMARCAL1-RBM to bind to RPA32C with an affinity as strong as that
of the other targets and were initially surprised to observe that
in contrast, it bound more tightly than XPA, RAD52, and UNG2. However,
further consideration of the sequences suggests an explanation: stabilization
of the helical conformation in the RBM by key side chain residue pairs.
In this model, α-helical side chain i + 4 interactions
(E7–K11, E8–K12, R10–E14, K11–E15, E15–K19,
and K27–E31) in SMARCAL1-RBM serve to lower the energetic cost
of the disorder-to-helix transition required for binding of SMARCAL1-RBM
to RPA32C and offset the absence of favorable intermolecular electrostatic
interactions for other RPA32C targets such as XPA, UNG2, and RAD52.
A similar line of reasoning would also explain the stronger binding
of TIPIN to RPA32C, as it has the same potential helix-stabilizing i + 4 interactions as SMARCAL1-RBM (Figure ).

In order to interact with its numerous targets involved
in DNA
replication, damage response and repair, RPA32C must be able to orchestrate
the recruitment of other proteins in the DNA processing machinery
to the DNA substrate. To perform this function efficiently, RPA32C
is tethered via a flexible linker to the DNA binding apparatus of
RPA, allowing it to adopt a wide range of orientations to facilitate
recruitment and remodeling of the multi-protein machinery. In response
to replication stalling caused by genotoxic stress, SMARCAL1 regresses
replication forks to generate 4-way junctions important for fork restart,
thereby preventing the accumulation of excess ssDNA when helicase
and polymerase activity are uncoupled. Thus, SMARCAL1’s function
is vital to efficiently reset the DNA replication fork to enable repair
of fork-stalling lesions.

Upon encountering DNA damage, proteins
involved in halting the
cell cycle (e.g. TIPIN) and in resetting the replication fork (e.g.
SMARCAL1) are required prior to recruitment of DNA repair proteins
(e.g. UNG2, XPA, RPA52) to mend the damaged DNA. The higher affinity
of SMARCAL1 and TIPIN for RPA32C compared to the DNA repair proteins
may play a role in the sequence of DNA processing events at DNA damage
sites where RPA orchestrates the recruitment of multiple proteins.
Although this speculation is intriguing, the mechanisms for this cascade
of hand-offs remain obscure and are currently under investigation
in our laboratory.
