A gain-of-function
mutation (T635A) in the transient receptor potential
(TRP) channel TRPC3 results in abnormal channel gating and causes
cerebellar ataxia in the dominant Moonwalker (Mwk) mouse mutant. However, the underlying molecular and
structural mechanisms are unclear. Here, we used a combined approach
of computational modeling and functional characterization of proposed
TRPC3 mutants. Our findings support a mechanism by which the hydrogen
bonding capability of threonine 635 plays a significant role in maintaining
a stable, closed state channel. This capability is lost in the Mwk mutant, suggesting a structural basis for the disease-causing
phenotype in the Mwk mouse.

The transient
receptor potential
(TRP) family of ion channels is a large family of cation channels
of diverse functionality. Members of the TRP family have a wide range
of sensitivities, including temperature, membrane stretch, and internal
Ca2+ concentration, and are involved in numerous physiological
functions.1,2 With a wide variety of functions, the N-
and C-termini of TRP channels also exhibit a wide variety of structural
domains. However, the structural core of the TRP channels consisting
of a homotetramer of six transmembrane α-helices, topologically
similar to the voltage-gated K+ channels, remains constant
throughout all subtypes of the channel family.

Of the seven
subfamilies of the TRP channel family, the “canonical”
TRPC subfamily is found in the largest variety of species, including
the first species in which TRP channels were found, Drosophila
melanogaster. The TRPC subfamily has six members, which can
be divided into two groups by sequence identity: TRPC1, -4, and -5
and TRPC2, -3, and -6 with 41 and 69% sequence identity, respectively.
The physiological and pathological roles of the different TRPC channels
are beginning to emerge. Genetic mouse models have revealed a role
for TRPC3 in the cerebellum.3−5 Moreover, TRPC3 is part of a key
signaling pathway that is affected in cerebellar ataxia in mice and
humans,6 and recently, the first functionally
pathogenic variant in the human TRPC3 gene was identified in a patient
with adult-onset cerebellar ataxia7 (OMIM
entry 616410). Interestingly, not only the loss but also a dominant
gain-of-function mutation in TRPC3 causes cerebellar ataxia. The ataxic Moonwalker (Mwk) mouse harbors a single
nonsynonymous point mutation in exon 7 of the Trpc3 gene, resulting in a threonine-to-alanine amino acid change (T635A
according to UniprotKB entry B1ATV3) in the cytoplasmic S4–S5
linker region of the TRPC3 channel protein (Figure 1A) and in altered channel gating.5 The molecular and structural mechanisms by which the Mwk mutation leads to abnormal TRPC3 channel gating remain to be characterized.

linker region. (A) Schematic of the six-transmembrane TRPC3 channel
protein, in which the six transmembrane helices, S1–S6 (numbered

(checkered box), another predicted coiled coil domain (gray box),
and a predicted CIRB domain (light gray box). The Mwk mutation (T635A) resides within the S4–S5 linker region and
is indicated by a yellow circle. The sequence alignment of the wild-type
and mutant mouse TRPC3 S4–S5 linker region is shown below.

channels than in TRP channels. The analysis includes Kv’s 1.x–10.x for a total of 40 sequences
analyzed for Kv channels, and all representatives of the TRPC, TRPM,
TRPV, TRPA, TRPP, and TRPML subfamilies for a total of 28 sequences
analyzed for TRP channels. Figures made using WebLogo and MAFFT sequence
alignments of all Kv and TRP channels identified in ref (38).

Interestingly, gain-of-function mutations in the S4–S5
linker
region have also been described in other TRP channels, highlighting
the importance of this region for TRP channel function. Recently,
the mutation of a glycine to a serine nearer to S4 in this region
of TRPC4 and TRPC5 was shown to result in constitutively active channels.8 Similarly, a gain-of-function mutant of the yeast
TRP channel (YVC1) and diseases linked to mutants of TRPV3 and TRPV4
and TRPML3 have been seen in the same region9−12 (Figure 1B). With the recently published high-resolution structure of TRPV1,13,14 the first of its kind of any TRP channel, it is clearer than ever
that this disease-implicated region is in fact the structurally and
functionally relevant S4–S5 linker domain that links the pore
domain to the other transmembrane helices of the channel (Figure 1C).

In this study, we used a combined approach
of computational modeling
and functional characterization of proposed mutants to investigate
the mechanistic basis of the Mwk mutation in the
S4–S5 linker of TRPC3. Previously, a phosphorylation-related
mechanism was proposed.5 However, our findings
described here favor a mechanism in which the hydrogen bonding capability
of residue 635 plays a significant role in maintaining a stable, closed
state channel. This capability is lost in the Mwk T635A mutant, thereby providing a structural basis for the gain-of-function
disease phenotype in the Mwk mouse.

Experimental
Procedures
Plasmids
The FLAG-tagged TRPC3 plasmid has been described
previously.5 Point mutations were introduced
by site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies). All constructs
were verified by Sanger sequencing. The HA-NFAT1(1–460)-GFP
expression construct was obtained from Addgene.

Cell Culture,
Transfections, and Cellular Assays
Neuro-2a
cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown under standard
conditions. Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 Transfection
Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For cell death assays, cells transfected with FLAG-TRPC3 constructs
were fixed after 24 h with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to indirect
immunofluorescence using an antibody to FLAG (1:500, Sigma). Cell
survival and death were assessed on the basis of cell integrity and
the morphology of the nucleus as determined using the DNA dye DAPI
(Vector Laboratories). Cell counts were conducted in a blinded manner,
and 50–100 cells were counted per condition. Cells were acquired
from three independent experiments. For NFAT translocation assays,
cells transfected with FLAG-TRPC3 constructs alongside GFP-tagged
NFAT were fixed after 18 h with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected
to indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies to FLAG (1:500, Sigma),
GFP (1:500, Clontech), and the DNA dye DAPI (Vector Laboratories).
Cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of GFP-NFAT were scored in 50–100
FLAG-positive cells. Cells were acquired from three independent experiments.
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism.

Biotinylation of Cerebellar
Slice Cultures
Cerebellar
organotypic slice cultures were prepared as described previously,5 and biotinylation experiments were conducted
as described previously15 using Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin
(Thermo Scientific) and StrepTactin sepharose (GE Healthcare). Protein
lysates prepared with RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) were subjected
to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) followed by immunoblotting with anti-TRPC3 (1:200,
Alomone) and anti-Actin (1:1000, Abcam) antibodies. Antibody binding
was detected by enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare).

Homology Modeling
The S1–S6 regions of mouse
TRPC3 and rat TRPV1 have a sequence identity of only ∼19%,
despite both being in the TRP channel family. Additional methods were
therefore employed to ensure an optimal sequence alignment, such as
transmembrane helix prediction, disorder prediction, and glycosylation
site data. Transmembrane helix prediction was performed with TMHMM,16 GlobPlot,17 PSIPRED,18 and Jpred19 to aid
confirmation of helix placements in alignments with the TRPV1 sequence.
In initial alignments, the S1 and S4–S6 alignments were consistent
and robust to changes in alignment methods and to slight variations
in sequence. In contrast, the S2–S4 alignment was less robust.
Thus, even in the final alignment, the S2 helix included some gaps.
However, this is unlikely to have a major influence on our results,
as our primary focus is on the S4–S5 linker and S6 helix regions
of the protein. To inform our alignment, previously published data
on the placement of extracellular and intracellular loops from glycosylation
site data were used.20 Additionally, both
the Regional Order Neural Network21 (RONN, http://www.strubi.ox.ac.uk/RONN) and disEMBL22 (http://dis.embl.de) servers predicted a sequence
of Q568–P578 between the S3 and S4 helices of mouse TRPC3 to
be disordered, informing the removal of this region (continuing to
P593) from the final MAFFT23 alignment
used to build the homology model on the rat TRPV1 structure.

In total, five templates were used in homology modeling: the Kv 1.2/2.1
chimera structure (PDB entry 2R9R), the TRPV1 apo structure (PDB entry 3J5P), the TRPV1 apo
structure (PDB entry 3J5P) with the Kv 1.2/2.1 channel chimera structure for the S4–S5
linker, the TRPV1 DkTx- and RTX-bound structure (PDB entry 3J5Q) with the Kv 1.2/2.1
channel chimera structure for the S4–S5 linker, and the TRPV1
capsaicin-bound structure (PDB entry 3J5R) with the Kv 1.2/2.1 channel chimera
structure for the S4–S5 linker. One hundred models of mTRPC3
were made with MODELLER version 9.1024 on
each of these templates (generating a total of 500 models). All of
these models were made using the same sequence alignment, and none
of them included the Q568–P593 region. Modeling required the
use of both the multichain and the multitemplate protocols in MODELLER,
allowing all four chains of the homotetrameric mTRPC3 to have similar
conformations through symmetry restraints. The top models according
to the MODELLER scoring function were chosen to examine a possible
mechanistic basis for the Mwk gain-of-function phenotype.
Potential hydrogen bonding partners were determined after adding hydrogens
and according to the Baker–Hubbard definition25 as implemented in MDTraj.26 Final
model quality was assessed with PROCHECK.27 Additional assessment of the localization and orientation of the
S4–S5 in the bilayer was conducted via insertion of the top
atomistic models into a coarse-grained template using CG2AT.28 The template was created via a 100-ns coarse-grained
self-assembly simulation, in which a POPC bilayer was allowed to form
around a coarse-grained model of the mTRPC3 using the MARTINI force
field29 within Gromacs version 4.5.5.30

Results
Similar TRPC3 Localization
and Calcium Influx in Wild-Type and Mwk Neuronal
Cells
The mutated Mwk TRPC3 channel is expressed
at levels similar to that of wild-type
TRPC3 in the mouse cerebellum.5 Furthermore,
we found in biotinylation experiments that equal amounts of TRPC3
were localized to the cell surface in cerebellar slice cultures from
both wild-type and Mwk mice (Figure 2A), suggesting that the Mwk mutation does
not alter the normal expression pattern of TRPC3 at the plasma membrane
in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Electrophysiological recordings
have shown that Mwk Purkinje cells are profoundly
impaired in their intrinsic and evoked electrophysiological properties
consistent with a gain-of-function mutation in TRPC3.3,5 Moreover, Mwk (T635A) but not wild-type TRPC3 robustly
induced cell death upon overexpression in mouse neuronal cell lines,
including NSC-345 and Neuro-2a cells (Figure 2B). This is consistent with the Mwk mutation being a gain-of-function mutation, which renders the channel
in a more open conformation, thereby allowing nonrestricted influx
of calcium into the transfected cells causing cell death. To demonstrate
that the overexpression of mutant TRPC3 increases calcium influx,
we co-expressed a GFP-tagged version of the calcium-sensitive transcription
factor NFAT alongside TRPC3. Under normal conditions, inactive NFAT
is phosphorylated and resides in the cytoplasm; however, upon calcium
influx, NFAT is dephosphorylated by calcineurin and translocates to
the nucleus where it activates gene expression.31 Indeed, we found that overexpression of mutant but not
wild-type TRPC3 significantly increased the nuclear localization of
GFP-tagged NFAT, indicative of increased calcium signaling downstream
of mutant TRPC3 (Figure 2C,D). Consistent with
these in vitro findings, increased calcium signaling
is also evident in vivo in the Mwk cerebellum.32

Figure 2 The gain-of-function Mwk mutation in TRPC3 causes
increased cell death and calcium signaling in neuronal cells. (A)
Equal amounts of TRPC3 are expressed at the cell surface in the mouse
cerebellum. Biotinylated cerebellar slice cultures from wild-type
(WT) and Mwk mice were lysed and subjected to pull-down
experiments using streptavidin beads, followed by immunoblotting for
TRPC3 and actin. Abbreviations: I, input; S, supernatant; B, pellet
(biotinylated fraction). (B) Overexpression of Mwk (T635A) but not wild-type (WT) TRPC3 significantly induced cell
death in mouse Neuro-2a cells (mean ± SEM; n = 3; ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test; p &lt; 0.005). V denotes vector control. (C and D) Overexpression
of Mwk (T635A) but not wild-type (WT) TRPC3 causes
significant nuclear localization of co-expressed GFP-tagged NFAT (mean

h after transfection and subjected to indirect immunofluorescence
using antibodies against FLAG, GFP, and the DNA dye DAPI. Cells transfected
with mutant TRPC3 have a more rounded appearance because of their
impending cell death. (E) The in vitro gain-of-function
phenotype of Mwk TRPC3 is not likely to be mediated
by phosphorylation. Overexpression of the phospho-mimic T635D mutation
but also of the control T635N mutation did not induce cell death in
mouse Neuro-2a cells (mean ± SEM; n = 3; ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test). (F) Overexpression
of the phospho-mimic T635D mutation but also of the control T635N
mutation did not cause significant nuclear translocation of GFP-NFAT
(mean ± SEM; n = 3; ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s
post hoc test).

Functional Characterization
of TRPC3 Phosphometic Residues
One proposed explanation for
the abnormal TRPC3 channel gating
observed in the Mwk mouse was the loss of an inhibitory
phosphorylation by protein kinase C γ (PKCγ).5 PKCγ has been shown to inhibit TRPC3 channel
activity in overexpression experiments in heterologous cell lines.33−36 Moreover, the mutated threonine 635 in Mwk TRPC3
was shown to be phosphorylated by PKCγ in an in vitro kinase assay.5 To assess the possible
effect of phosphorylation at threonine 635 on cell survival and calcium
signaling, we expressed a TRPC3 mutant in which this threonine was
replaced with aspartate (T635D) to mimic phosphorylation at this site.
We found that overexpression of the TRPC3 T635D mutant did not cause
cell death or an increased level of calcium signaling, consistent
with the hypothesis that phosphorylation at this site is inhibitory
(Figure 2E,F). However, to our surprise, we
also did not detect any effect on cell death or calcium signaling
when overexpressing a TRPC3 mutant, in which threonine 635 was replaced
with asparagine (T635N), which is neither a phospho-mimic nor itself
phosphorylated (Figure 2E,F). We therefore
sought an alternative explanation for the observed functional consequences
of the TRPC3 Mwk mutation.

TRPV1 and Kv Channel Structures
Provide Initial Clues
The striking sequence identity between
the S4–S5 linker region
of mouse TRPC3 and that of Kv channels encouraged us to examine a
wide variety of structural and functional data available for the transmembrane
region of Kv channels. Indeed, the corresponding threonine of the
Kv1.2/2.1 chimera structure (PDB entry 2R9R, a proposed open state structure) points
inward toward the S6 helix, suggestive of a key role in determining
channel open state probability. However, in Kv channels, it is thought
that the threonine corresponding to the mTRPC3 T635 (T320 according
to UniprotKB entry P63142) fits inside a groove in the S6 helix along
with a conserved isoleucine.37 The same
threonine to alanine mutation that induces the Mwk phenotype in TRPC3 produces faster desensitizing Kv channels. This
suggests that the alanine mutation stabilizes the closed state in
Kv channels, instead of destabilizing it as in mouse TRPC3, hinting
that the mechanism may not be conserved.

Previously, a number
of structures of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels were used as
templates for modeling studies aimed at understanding TRPC channel
structure–function relationships. While the overall sequence
identity of Kv and TRP channels is poor,38 the S4–S5 linker region is surprisingly similar between TRPCs
and Kv channels (Figure 1B). Even more striking
is the fact that the threonine mutated in the Mwk mouse is more highly conserved in Kv channels than in TRP channels
(Figure 1D). However, while Kv channel structures
provide a good template for the S4–S5 linker, the pore-lining
S6 helices of Kv and TRP channels differ substantially. For example,
the Kv channel has the PVP motif, which causes a functionally significant
kink in the helix, but this is not present in TRP channels. The recently
determined high-resolution structures of TRP channels make the role
of the S4–S5 linker in TRP channels clearer.13,14,39 In addition, the TRPV1 structure provided
the first confirmation that the proposed homology to the Kv channel
structure was in fact correct: despite a low sequence identity, the
structural similarity between the TRPV1 structure and previous structures
of voltage-gated channels is significant (∼1 Å root-mean-square
deviation for the tetrameric transmembrane domain). Notably, the intracellular
portion of the channel, especially the region of S6 near the S4–S5
linker, is crucial to gating. This can be seen explicitly in the conformational
difference between the ligand-bound (open) and apo (closed) states
of the recently determined structures of TRPV1.14

Modeling the Mwk TRPC3 Channel
With
this evidence in hand, the Mwk mutation in the S4–S5
linker could disturb intramolecular interactions within TRPC3 that
are important for the gating mechanism of the channel. To test this
hypothesis, we built homology models of the mouse TRPC3 transmembrane
region based on available high-resolution structures of homotetrameric
6TM ion channels (see Experimental Procedures). First, the high-resolution apo structure of TRPV1 was used on
its own, and then the Kv 1.2/2.1 chimera structure was also included.
A multitemplate combination consisting mostly of the apo TRPV1 structure,
but including the linker region of the Kv channel chimera structure,
was then devised. The full tetrameric transmembrane domain, including
the TRP box motif, was modeled. The final sequence identity was 17%
to the Kv 1.2/2.1 chimera sequence and 21% to the TRPV1 sequence (Figure 3A,B).

Figure 3 Homology modeling reveals potential for hydrogen
bonding. (A) Sequence

of S3 to facilitate modeling. Transmembrane helices are indicated

top view and a side view. Coloring indicates separate chains of the
tetrameric channel. The S1–S4 helices of the purple chain have
been removed for the sake of clarity in the side view figure. (C)
Homology models of TRPC3 indicate that the threonine 635 (in green)
mutated in the Mwk mouse has the potential for hydrogen
bonding with the end of helix S6. The first quadrant shows an overlap
of four models and the resulting T635 orientation. The remaining quadrants
show three possible hydrogen bonding partners: S735 (cyan), Y736 (magenta),
and the adjacent R634 (yellow). (D) Overexpression of the TRPC3 mutants Mwk (T635A) and T635V significantly induced cell death in
mouse Neuro-2a cells (mean ± SEM; n = 3; ANOVA
followed by the Newman–Keuls post hoc test; p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05). (E) Overexpression
of the TRPC3 mutants Mwk (T635A) and T635V caused
significant nuclear translocation of GFP-NFAT (mean ± SEM; n = 3; ANOVA followed by the Newman–Keuls post hoc
test; p &lt; 0.0001). (F) Overexpression of the TRPC3
mutants S735A and Y736F did not induce cell death upon overexpression
in Neuro-2a cells (mean ± SEM; n = 3; ANOVA
followed by the Newman–Keuls post hoc test). See also Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information. (G) Other
possible hydrogen bonding partners on the S6 helix (indicated as wheat
mesh) were not seen as being viable for experimental validation as
they pointed away from the site in question. Building homology models
using the capsaicin-bound open state TRPV1 structure, however, indicated
a further possible hydrogen bonding interaction with N726 (red) on
helix S6. This interaction is with an adjacent subunit, and not the
same subunit as with residues predicted with models based on the apo
TRPV1. N726 is 10 residues toward the center of the membrane along
S6 compared to other residues suspected to interact with T635.

The resulting models were broadly
reasonable (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information) and, upon their insertion
into a POPC bilayer of the S4–S5 helix, proved to be amphipathic
and parallel to the bilayer plane, while residue T635 was not in a
position likely to interact with lipids. In all of the resulting models
of mTRPC3, the T635 residue in the S4–S5 linker pointed inward,
toward the pore domain, and in some models within the ensemble, hydrogen
bonds to residues at the end of helix S6 were seen (Figure 3C). These observations were consistent with the
experimental results that showed that replacing threonine 635 with
the polar amino acid aspartate or asparagine produced the wild-type
phenotype (Figure 2), suggesting that the wild-type
phenotype was propagated by the hydrogen bonding capabilities of all
three of these amino acids.

Evidence of Hydrogen Bonding and Search for
a Partner
To further test whether a substitution that would
abrogate the hydrogen
bonding would behave like the Mwk mutation, we replaced
the threonine residue at position 635 with valine (T635V), a nonpolar
amino acid that is isosteric with threonine. Upon overexpression in
neuronal cells, the TRPC3 T635V mutant caused increased calcium influx
and cell death, similar to the Mwk TRPC3 mutant T635A
(Figure 3D,E). Although overall the cellular
phenotype was not as strong as for the Mwk mutation,
this result supports the suggestion that the loss of a critical hydrogen
bond contributes to the Mwk gain-of-function phenotype.

Once this phenotype was established, we undertook further investigation
of the specific hydrogen bonds seen in the models. Indeed, serine
735 and tyrosine 736 at the end of helix S6 emerged as possible hydrogen
bonding partners (Figure 3C, full description
available in Tables S1–S3 of the Supporting
Information). However, some indication of possible hydrogen
bonds with backbone carbonyls at this end of S6 was also seen, but
only in initial models based on the Kv 1.2/2.1 chimera structure (Table
S3 of the Supporting Information). Moreover,
as this type of interaction is less tractable to address via mutagenesis
experiments, this initial finding was not pursued experimentally.

To experimentally address the viability of the proposed hydrogen
bonding partners, tyrosine 736 was mutated to phenylalanine (Y736F)
and subjected to cell death assays in neuronal cells. However, overexpression
of the TRPC3 Y736F mutant did not result in a Mwk-like phenotype in these assays (Figure 3F).
Similarly, serine 735 was replaced with nonpolar residues (alanine,
valine, or leucine) and overexpressed in neuronal cells (Figure 3F and Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information). These nonpolar mutants behaved like wild-type
TRPC3 and did not mimic the gain-of-function Mwk phenotype in vitro. These results indicate that neither of the proposed
residues’ side chains interacts as a hydrogen bonding partner
with T635. As an alternative explanation, the channel might be able
to compensate for the loss of hydrogen bonding.

While S735 and
Y736 were immediate candidates, the other possible
hydrogen bonding side chains along S6 were excluded because of their
location on the wrong side of the helix to facilitate interactions
(Figure 3G). This encourages a view that, as
seen in some models, the threonine could be hydrogen bonding to a
backbone carbonyl to stabilize the closed state channel in this region
of S6. However, upon construction of models of mouse TRPC3 based on
the two ligand-bound structures of TRPV1, an unexpected tentative
interaction with N726 on the S6 helix, which is 10 residues closer
to the center of the membrane, was seen with an adjacent subunit,
rather than of the same subunit as had been seen for the previous
potential partners discussed. However, this was seen only upon visual
inspection and not supported by more rigorous Baker–Hubbard
determination of hydrogen bonding (see the Supporting
Information). Alternatively, it is possible that the T635 hydrogen
bond partner sought is to other residues on the S4–S5 linker,
which was seen in models but not investigated experimentally because
they were not expected to result in the large effect seen in the Mwk mouse (Figure 3C).

Discussion
In this study, through a combination of modeling and functional
experiments, we have investigated a possible mechanistic basis for
the Mwk mouse disease phenotype, which is caused
by the mutation of TRPC3’s threonine 635 to an alanine (T635A).
We have shown that the Mwk gain-of-function phenotype
most likely arises because of the loss of the hydrogen bonding capabilities
of threonine 635. Together, our findings suggest that the ataxic phenotype
in the Mwk mouse is the result of the loss of this
hydrogen bond, thereby destabilizing the closed state TRPC3 and resulting
in a constitutively active channel.

While it is not clear currently
which residue forms a hydrogen
bonding interaction with threonine 635, our studies have narrowed
the possibilities for these interactions. The possibilities of S735
and Y736 presented by homology modeling were investigated experimentally
with negative results. This leaves four possibilities remaining: (1)
One of these is a hydrogen bonding partner, but the channel has some
way of compensating for its loss. (2) The T635 side chain hydrogen
bonds to a backbone carbonyl not tractable to investigate via simple
mutagenesis experiments. (3) The hydrogen bonding partner is adjacent
on the S4–S5 linker and was not investigated experimentally.
(4) Hydrogen bonding is in fact with an adjacent subunit with a residue
such as N726. Alternatively, it is conceivable if somewhat unlikely
that the mTRPC3 channel adopts a conformation in this region very
different from that seen in the TRPV1 and Kv structures that were
used as templates.

Because the threonine to valine mutant (T635V)
recapitulated the Mwk phenotype to a lesser extent
than the Mwk threonine to alanine mutant (T635A)
upon overexpression in neuronal
cells, it is possible that there are other steric interactions at
play that help to stabilize the closed state channel further. This
supports the proposal that removing the hydrogen bonding partner is
not entirely sufficient to reproduce the Mwk phenotype,
as such a mutation could leave these steric interactions intact and
other compensatory mechanisms might then result in no significant
change in phenotype.

In looking at models of mTRPC3, we were
most interested in hydrogen
bonding that might stabilize the closed state structures through hydrogen
bonding to T635; therefore, the apo TRPV1 structure was the focus
as a model template. However, models based on the ligand-bound TRPV1
structures resulted in a new suggestion (N726) as a possible interaction
partner for T635. Because the sequences and functional properties
of TRPV1 and TRPC3 are quite different, it is possible that the open
state structures of TRPV1 and TRPC3 do not correspond. Additionally,
the interaction with N726 is seen for the TRPC3 model on the TRPV1
capsaicin-bound structure, which has an outer pore more closed than
that of the RTX/DkTx-bound structure. Thus, this model could indeed
correspond to a closed state TRPC3, indicating a real possibility
that N726 is a viable bonding partner.

Also of note is the peculiar
sequence identity between the S4–S5
linker of TRPC3 and Kv channels. This similarity adds another interesting
feature to the question of Kv–TRP structure–function
similarities, as it is still unclear if the similar topology of voltage-gated
channels and TRP channels has functional significance. Very few sequences
of the high identity of this S4–S5 linker region have previously
been noted between TRP and voltage-gated channels. While this similarity
in the S4–S5 linker is remarkable on its own, it also promotes
our confidence in an S6 helix facing T635 despite a low overall sequence
identity. Additionally, the high percentage identity at the end of
helix S6 between rTRPV1 and mTRPC3 encourages our analysis here. In
hypothesizing that T635 of the S4–S5 linker of mTRPC3 plays
a significant functional role, we are not positing that the S1–S4
linker necessarily also has a strong functional role, as it was seen
in the TRPV1 structures that its movement is minimal upon ligand binding
and channel opening. In fact, we suggest that the S4–S5 linker
plays a role in stabilizing the S6 helix, which the side chain of
residue T635 seems to face, even upon placement in a bilayer.

Together, these studies have resulted in further insights into
a likely mechanism of the Mwk mouse phenotype. However,
further refinement of the homology models, including more extensive
membrane-embedded simulations, could help in the more robust exploration
of the conformational stability and dynamics of these models. It would
also be of possible interest to include the recent TRPA1 channel structure
as an additional template, and possibly to compare the output of membrane
protein-specific tools such as MEDELLER40 and/or Rosetta Membrane41 with those
of the used MODELLER. Additionally, a more exhaustive alanine scan
of the region of the protein identified in this study and/or the use
of non-natural amino acids in mutations might yield further insights
into a definitive hydrogen bonding for the T635 residue of the TRPC3
channel. Ultimately, the future crystallization of additional TRP
channels including TRPC3 should provide a better template for modeling
the functional effect of the Mwk mutation and other
ataxia-causing TRPC3 mutations.

Overall, it remains clear from
the current studies that understanding
the structural–functional significance of the S4–S5
linker of TRP channels has important implications to understanding
the mechanistic basis of certain diseases. For the first time, with
access to structural information through the recent high-resolution
TRP channel structures, we are able to hypothesize more clearly about
this mechanistic basis, at least in the case of the Mwk mouse model of cerebellar ataxia. Mechanistic insight like this
might help in the development of targeted treatments to ion channels
including TRPC3 for cerebellar ataxia in the future.
