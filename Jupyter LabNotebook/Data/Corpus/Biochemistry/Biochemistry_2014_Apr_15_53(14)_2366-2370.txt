Amyloid fibrils are filamentous
protein aggregates arranged in cross-β structures, in which
the individual subunits contain β-strands that run approximately
perpendicular to the fibril axis, forming β-sheets that run
parallel to the fibril axis., A large number of proteins
can form amyloids, exhibiting biological effects that can be pathological
or functional. Pathological amyloids are
implicated in diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, and type 2 diabetes. Functional
amyloids are used in normal biological functions such as bacterial
biofilm formation, human melanin synthesis, or as storage units for peptide hormones. Prions, proteinaceous infectious agents, tend
to form amyloid fibrils that can also be pathological, as in Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, or functional, such as HET-s, which is used in fungal mating-type determination.
The biological activity of an amyloid is uniquely determined by its
molecular structure, so accurate structural characterization is key
to understanding the pathogenicity or function of the amyloid.

Previous studies have found that some amyloids appear to maintain
their structures after dehydration,− though these studies
have been limited to observations of amyloids with stacked β-sheet
architectures,,, in which the amyloid cores consist of approximately parallel β-sheets
8–10 Å apart., Amyloid fibrils formed
from the yeast prion-forming domain Sup35NM have been shown to have
in-register parallel β-sheet structures in hydrated and dehydrated
states but different fiber diffraction
patterns, indicating structural changes
within the subunit while essentially maintaining the same cross-β
hydrogen bonding arrangement. It has been suggested that the Huntington’s
disease-related poly glutamine amyloid has a water-filled nanotube
structure, and high resolution models
of Alzheimer’s disease-related Aβ 1–40 amyloids
have shown water-accessible cores,, indicating
that certain complex amyloid structures could be significantly impacted
by dehydration. The fungal prion-forming domain HET-s(218–289)
forms a two-rung β-solenoid structure with a hydrophobic core that is not solvent accessible. Previous studies on HET-s(218–289) hydration
have shown that fibrils rehydrated after lyophilization showed identical
spectra to fibrils that had not been lyophilized. In this study, we show that despite a lack of water-accessible
structures, the complex molecular architecture of HET-s(218–289)
is substantially affected by dehydration. The effects of dehydration
on fibril structure are reversible but not completely so.

Experimental
Procedures
Preparation of Fiber Diffraction Specimens
HET-s(218–289)
was recombinantly expressed, purified, and fibrillized into the β-solenoid
form at pH 7.5 as previously described. After fibrillization, fibrils were moved into pH 4.0, dilute HCl
by three rounds of ultracentrifugation and resuspension. Oriented
sols were made as described elsewhere. A solution of HET-s(218–289) was centrifuged at 264000g into a soft pellet and freeze–thawed five times.
The pellet was sheared through a 0.5 mm glass capillary to induce
orientation and sealed with an oxygen torch. Dried fiber specimens
were prepared by hanging 12 μL droplets between sealed, silanized,
and sanded capillaries and drying at nominal 100% relative humidity
(RH). After drying, specimens were stored at 0%, 33%, 75%, 83%, 98%,
and 100% RH in specimen chambers containing
silica gel and saturated solutions of MgCl2, NaCl, KCl,
K2SO4, and water, respectively. Zero percent
relative humidity specimens were rehydrated by inundating the silica
gel in the specimen chambers with water. Lyophilized specimens were
prepared by lyophilizing HET-s(218–289) fibril solutions followed
by resuspension in water before forming dried fibers.

Data Collection
and Processing
X-ray fiber diffraction
data were collected at the BioCAT beamline at the Advanced Photon
Source at Argonne National Laboratory, and at the Biological Small-Angle
X-ray Scattering beamline 4–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Lightsource. Diffraction data were transformed into reciprocal space and background subtracted using WCEN. Meridional and equatorial plots were produced
from processed patterns using WCEN by integrating over a 30°
angle centered on each axis. Plots from each diffraction pattern were
linearly scaled using a coefficient determined by least-squares fitting
of the continuous equatorial diffraction data between 0.03 and 0.20
Å–1 (∼33–4 Å).

Results
Comparison
of Hydrated Forms of HET-s(218–289)
To compare the
structures of fully hydrated and dried specimens under
high humidity conditions, X-ray fiber diffraction was performed on
oriented sols and dried fiber specimens (Figure ). Oriented sols are concentrated HET-s(218–289) solutions
sealed in glass capillaries, thus ensuring full hydration. Diffraction
patterns from sols showed a large amount of water diffraction, seen
around the edges of the patterns as a broad ring at ∼3.5 Å
resolution (∼0.3 Å–1) (Figure A). The water diffraction is much stronger than
the very weak amyloid diffraction, though the sample still shows orientation.
The strong water and weak amyloid diffraction show that even after
ultracentrifugation, the HET-s(218–289) pellets retain a large
amount of water relative to protein. Diffraction from dried fibers
maintained at nominal 100% relative humidity (RH) showed relatively
stronger amyloid diffraction and better orientation than oriented
sol patterns (Figure B). Qualitative comparisons
of layer line spacings and relative equatorial intensities in these
dried fiber patterns and oriented sol diffraction patterns indicated
that the structures were similar. Quantitative comparisons could not
be performed owing to the weak diffraction and low orientation of
the oriented sol patterns. HET-s(218–289) β-solenoid
diffraction has been discussed in detail elsewhere., Briefly, the two-rung repeating unit produces the characteristic
4.7 Å cross-β meridional reflection, reflecting the distance
between β-strands. An additional 9.4 Å meridional reflection
is caused by the two-strand thick repeating unit, while off-meridional
diffraction maxima at 8.5 Å arise from the helical symmetry of
the fibril. Equatorial diffraction consists of a series of diffraction
maxima of comparable intensities, indicative of a roughly cylindrical,
packed structure, distinct from a stacked β-sheet architecture.,

Fiber Diffraction of HET-s(218–289)
under Different Relative
Humidities
To determine the impact of dehydration on HET-s(218–289)
structure, we collected diffraction data from specimens first dried
at nominal 100% RH and further dried to 0%, 33%, 75%, 83%, and 98%
RH (Figure A–F). To assess the reversibility
of dehydration, the 0% RH specimen was rehydrated at nominal 100%
RH, and diffraction data were collected (Figure G). For comparison, meridional and equatorial intensities were integrated,
plotted, and scaled by least-squares fitting of the equatorial data
between ∼30 and 4 Å (∼0.03–0.25 Å–1) resolution (Figure H,I).
Dehydration did not affect the projection of the structure on the
fiber axis; meridional relative intensities did not change (Figure H). Meridional diffraction spacings were also not
perturbed, indicating that the helical parameters of the fibrils were
unchanged. Diffraction along the equator, however, showed substantial
changes on dehydration. By 83% RH, there was virtually complete loss
of ∼50 Å and ∼17 Å maxima. While very low
resolution diffraction such as the ∼50 Å maximum can sometimes
be related to interfibril packing within a specimen, this is unlikely
to be the case in HET-s(218–289), as we have consistently observed
this intensity maximum in diffraction from many different preparations
and specimens., The relative strengthening of
the ∼11 Å (0.09 Å–1) maximum suggested
a collapse of the triangular hydrophobic core of HET-s(218–289)
into a more parallel arrangement, resembling a stacked β-sheet
structure. Rehydration of the desiccated specimen resulted in incomplete
recovery of low resolution diffraction maxima, with an equatorial
plot closely resembling the 98% RH plot.

To quantitate the level of structural
changes caused by dehydration,
correlation coefficients (CC) were calculated between the equatorial
data from each pair of specimens in two different resolution ranges.
In the intermediate resolution range (∼30–4 Å,
∼0.03–0.25 Å–1) meaningful correlation
(CC &gt; 0.8), with the 100% RH specimen was
lost by 83% RH (Table ). When the full available
resolution range was used (100–4 Å, 0.01–0.25 Å–1), meaningful correlation was lost by 98% RH (Table ), although comparisons using CCs across the full
resolution range may not be as useful as comparisons using intermediate
resolutions, owing to the high sensitivity of the ∼50 Å
intensity maximum to dehydration. CCs also showed that the rehydrated
specimen correlated more closely with the 98% RH specimen than with
the nominal 100% RH specimen.

In order to be more comparable
to fibrils studied by ssNMR, HET-s(218–289)
fibrils in solution were
lyophilized and rehydrated prior to fiber diffraction specimen preparation.
The resultant fibrils provided fiber diffraction patterns consistent
with two-rung β-solenoid diffraction (Figure S2, ), but poor orientation
prevented quantitative comparisons owing to the inability to perform
accurate background subtraction. Qualitative comparisons of relative
intensities of the ∼17 and ∼11 Å equatorial maxima
(Figure ) are more similar to the 98% RH and
rehydrated specimens (Figure E,G), which show
a more intense ∼11 Å relative to the ∼17 Å,
while the 100% RH specimens show the opposite (Figure F).

Modeling the Effect of
Dehydration
Molecular models
were constructed by modifying the ssNMR structure of HET-s(218–289)
in efforts to reproduce the types of structural change that can give
rise to our observed fiber diffraction patterns. Our modifications
of the structure take into account interatomic contacts but are not
otherwise optimized. While our modifications are hypothetical, the
modeling emphasizes the overall changes in architecture necessary
to produce diffraction patterns consistent with the experimental results.
Comparisons between simulated and experimental data were performed
at resolutions between 0.030 and 0.125 Å–1 (∼33–8
Å), as agreement between the ssNMR model and experimental data
was only reliable in this range, probably owing to disorder within
the fibril that we were unable to simulate and problems with comparing
diffraction patterns that represent static averaged data and ssNMR
models, which represent ensemble structures. We have previously shown
that the fibrils that provide the characteristic β-solenoid
diffraction patterns also produce ssNMR spectra identical to those
used for ssNMR structure determination. Simulated diffraction from the ssNMR structure (Figure A) fit the 100% RH experimental data well (Figure D), with a CC of 0.85.

The ssNMR model of
HET-s(218–289) was modified to fit the 0% RH experimental data
by straightening the β-strands into a stacked β-sheet
structure (Figure B). The simulated equator
from this structure showed the loss of the ∼17 Å maximum
but did not produce an ∼10 Å maximum with the same sharpness
and intensity as the experimental pattern (Figure E), resulting in a CC with the experimental data of 0.73.
However, by using the same stacked β-sheet model (Figure B) in a two-protofilament arrangement (Figure C), the calculated equator showed increased intensity
and sharpness in the ∼10 Å maximum, the result of increased
∼10 Å sampling caused by increasing the number of β-sheets
stacked together. The CC between the two-protofilament model and the
experimental data was 0.97.

Discussion
We
have shown that dehydration of amyloid fibrils with complex
structures can significantly perturb the molecular structure. Similar
dehydration-related changes to amyloid diffraction patterns have been
observed elsewhere, but knowledge of
the hydrated structure of HET-s(218–289) provides us with further insights into the nature of the
structural changes. By molecular modeling and comparisons of calculated
and experimental diffraction patterns, we have shown that the observed
dehydration-related structural change is consistent with a transition
to a stacked β-sheet structure. Reproduction of the medium resolution
diffraction from our dehydrated specimens required a two-protofilament
model, suggesting that dehydration may induce the close association
of fibrils. Previous ssNMR observations of HET-s(218–289) had
shown that fibrils that had never been dried or had been lyophilized
and rehydrated had identical spectra, indicating that dehydration
of HET-s(218–289) fibrils was fully reversible. Our observations suggest that drying of our
fiber diffraction specimens is reversible, but not completely. Taken
together with the ssNMR results, these observations suggest that structural
changes in the individual subunits are reversible, but long-range
fibril interactions, which cannot be seen with ssNMR, are not fully
reversible. We might speculate that this irreversibility could be
caused by the formation of stable close interactions of the fibrils
during dehydration, as suggested by our molecular modeling.

Our results with HET-s(218–289) show that dehydration effects
can occur even in the absence of water-accessible channels. This observation
indicates that water on the surface of the fibril can play a substantial
role in its molecular structure. This does not appear to be the case
for stacked β-sheet amyloids,− possibly because the
crystalline nature of the β-sheet packing provides structural
stability against deformation caused by dehydration. Our observations
show that differences in hydration can affect amyloid structure, suggesting
that hydration must be controlled during studies in order to obtain
reproducible results. Our results show that water can play an important
role in amyloid structure even when no obvious water-accessible features
are present, emphasizing the importance of the surface solvent.
