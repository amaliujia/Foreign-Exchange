ATP-binding cassette transporter
G1 (ABCG1) belongs to the G branch of the ABC transporter superfamily
that includes five half-transporters, ABCG1, ABCG2, ABCG4, ABCG5,
and ABCG8. The putative structure of the G branch consists of one
NH2-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and one COOH-terminal
membrane-spanning domain (MSD) that contains six putative transmembrane
α-helices (Figure.A).− Some of the G family members,
such as ABCG1 and ABCG2, function as homodimers,, whereas
other family members, such as ABCG5 and ABCG8, function as heterodimers. ABCG1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) and Golgi and plasma membranes in macrophages and other cell
types.,− The half-transporter mediates
cholesterol efflux onto lipidated lipoproteins like high density lipoprotein
(HDL) but not onto lipid poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I).,,,, Mice lacking ABCG1 accumulate lipids in
macrophages and in hepatocytes and show
a significantly decreased level of plasma HDL after being fed a high
cholesterol diet or treated with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist
T0901317.

Predicted topology of ABCG1 and sequence alignment for ABCG family.
Only part of sequence alignment that includes the conserved sequence
(NPADF) is shown. The sequence alignment was performed by ClustalW2.
Panel B: Expression of wild type and mutant ABCG1. Whole cell lysates
were made from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with empty vectors
(V) or vectors containing wild type ABCG1 (WT) or mutant ABCG1 (NPDF-A)
cDNA and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Membrane was
cut into halves along the 82 kDa based on the prestained protein standards
(Life technology). The bottom part was probed with a polyclonal anti-ABCG1
antibody, H-65 (Santa Cruz), and the top part was detected with a
polyclonal anticalnexin antibody. Antibody binding was detected using
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse or with donkey antirabbit
IgG (Sigma) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce).
The membranes were then exposed to Kodak BioMax MR films (Kodak).

cholesterol efflux onto lipidated apoA-I was carried out as described
in . HEK293 cells were
transiently transfected with empty vector (V) or plasmid containing
cDNA of wild type or mutant ABCG1, NPDF-A, in which Asn316, Pro317,
Asp319, and Phe320 were replaced with Ala simultaneously. The cells
were then labeled with [3H]-cholesterol. After washing,
the cells were incubated with 5 μg/mL lipidated apoA-I. The
radioactive content of the media and cells was measured separately.

ABCG1 is highly expressed in macrophages and plays an important
role in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in vivo. Overexpression
of ABCG1 in macrophages significantly increases macrophage RCT in
vivo, whereas knockdown or knockout of ABCG1 expression
in macrophages markedly decreases macrophage RCT in vivo. However, the precise role of macrophage ABCG1
in the protection against the development of atherosclerosis remains
uncertain. Transplantation of bone marrow lacking ABCG1 into low density
lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr–/–) mice shows conflicting effects. Out et al. observed a moderate increase in atherosclerosis, whereas two other
independent groups reported that macrophages lacking ABCG1 decrease
atherosclerosis in hyperlipidemic Ldlr–/– mice., The explanation for this discrepancy is
not yet clarified. More recent findings have shown a complex role
of ABCG1 during the progression of atherosclerosis, depending on the
atherosclerotic stages examined. Lack of ABCG1 leads to a significant
increase in early atherosclerotic lesion size but causes retarded
lesion progression in the more advanced stages in Ldlr–/– mice. Interestingly, Schou et al. recently
reported that a genetic variation in ABCG1 promoter (−376C
&gt; T) that reduces mRNA levels of ABCG1 by about 40% is associated
with increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic heart disease.

ABCG1 and ABCA1 have been shown to promote
cellular cholesterol
efflux synergistically., The efflux of cholesterol
and phospholipids onto apoA-I mediated by ABCA1 converts apoA-I into
nascent HDL, which can then act as an efficient acceptor for ABCG1-mediated
cholesterol efflux. It has been demonstrated that ABCA1 and ABCG1,
but not SR-BI, are responsible for macrophage RCT in vivo. Knockout of both ABCA1 and ABCG1 in mice leads
to dramatic foam cell formation and acceleration of atherosclerosis.− In addition, it has been shown that ABCG1-mediated cholesterol translocation
plays an important role in pancreatic β-cell insulin secretion.− ABCG1 is required for reconstituted HDL (rHDL)-promoted insulin
secretion. Lack of ABCG1 expression dramatically reduces pancreatic
β-cell insulin secretion both in vivo and in vitro. However,
how ABCG1 mediates cholesterol efflux is unclear.

Most recently,
we found that ABCG1 is palmitoylated at five cysteine
residues. This covalent posttranslational modification is required
for ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. We also found that one highly conserved cysteine residue located
at position 514 (Cys514) in the first putative transmembrane α
helix plays an important role in ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux.
Replacement of Cys514 with Ala or Ser essentially eliminates ABCG1-mediated
cholesterol efflux. The transmembrane
domains of the ABC transporters vary considerably between different
ABC proteins. In contrast, the NBDs of the ABC transporters are highly
conserved. Each NBD contains three highly conserved sequence elements
(the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif, and a signature motif) that
play critical roles in ATP binding and hydrolysis and in the provision
of energy for the transporter to translocate its substrates across
the cell membranes. In addition to the traditional conserved motifs,
we found that a highly conserved sequence exists in the G branch of
the ABC transporter superfamily (Figure A).
The sequence is located between the NBD and MSD and contains five
amino acid residues. Asn, Pro, Asp, and Phe are completely conserved
among all of the five G subfamily members. The middle amino acid residue
is an Ala in all subfamily members except for ABCG5, where it is a
Phe (Figure A). To define its functional role,
we replaced these amino acid residues with Ala simultaneously or individually.
Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transiently or stably expressing
wild type or mutant ABCG1 were labeled with 3H sterols.
The efflux of sterol onto lipidated apoA-I and rHDL was examined.
We found that mutations of Asn316 and Phe 320 within the conserved
sequence impaired ABCG1 trafficking to the cell surface and reduced
cellular sterol efflux conferred by ABCG1.

dried under nitrogen gas in a glass tube and suspended in 500 μL
of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After that, 2 mg of recombinant
apoA-I in 500 μL of PBS was added, and the sample was sonicated

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis and Cell Culture
Human ABCG1
cDNA was cloned from human hepatocytes HepG2 as described and used as the template to generate mutations
using QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kits according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Oligonucleotides bearing mismatched
bases at the residue to be mutated were synthesized by IDT, Inc. (Coralville,
IA). The presence of the desired mutation and the integrity of each
construct were verified by DNA sequencing (TAGC, Edmonton, Canada).

HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (glucose, 4.5 g/Liter) containing 10% (v/v) FBS under
a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The cell lines stably
expressing wild type or mutant ABCG1 were generated as described., Several subclones were isolated, and the expression of ABCG1 was
confirmed by Western Blot analysis using a rabbit anti-ABCG1 polyclonal
antibody, H-65.

Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis
of ABCG1
The cells expressing wild type or mutant ABCG1 were
collected and
lysed in lysis buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 7.4) containing 1X Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors. Protein
concentration was determined by BCA protein assay. The same quantities
of total proteins were used to immunoprecipitate ABCG1 from the whole
cell lysates. Anti-C-Myc antibody 9E10 and anti-ABCG1 antibody 4497-conjugated
beads were used to immunoprecipitate C-Myc tagged and untagged ABCG1,
respectively. The whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitated ABCG1
eluted from the beads by 1× SDS loading buffer were fractionated
by 8% SDS-PAGE, which was followed by immunoblotting with specific
antibodies indicated. Antibody binding was detected using IRDye-labeled
goat antimouse or antirabbit IgG (Li-Cor Biosciences). The signals
were detected by a Licor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences).

Sterol Efflux Assay
Sterol efflux assay was performed
as described previously.,, Briefly, on day 1, HEK293 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were
transfected with plasmids expressing wild type or mutant ABCG1 using
Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h, the cells were directly labeled with
[3H]-cholesterol or [3H]-7-ketocholesterol (2
μCi/ml) for 16 h and then washed three times in 1 mL of DMEM
containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After, the cells were
incubated with DMEM containing 0.02% BSA and 5 μg/mL lipidated
apoA-I or rHDL. The media were collected. The cells were lysed in
0.5 mL of lysis buffer B (0.1 N NaOH, 0.01% SDS). The radioactive
content of the media and cells was measured separately by scintillation
counting. Sterol transfer was expressed as the percentage of the radioactivity
released from the cells into the media relative to the total radioactivity
in cells plus media.

Biotinylation Analysis of ABCG1
Cell surface proteins
were biotinylated as described., Briefly, HEK293 cells
transiently expressing wild type or mutant ABCG1 were biotinylated
using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Pierce). The cells were lysed in 200 μL of lysis buffer
A containing 1X protease inhibitors. A total of 40 μL of the
cell lysate was saved and 150 μL of the lysate was added to
60 μL of a 50% slurry of NeutrAvidin agarose (Pierce). The mixture
was rotated overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3000g for 5 min, the pellets were washed and the cell surface
proteins were eluted from the beads by adding 2 × SDS loading
buffer and incubated for 5 min at 85 °C. Proteins were then analyzed
by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.

Immunofluorescence of ABCG1
Confocal microscopy was
carried out as described previously.,− Briefly, the cells growing on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde
and permeabilized using cold methanol. After blocking, the cells were
incubated overnight in 1XPBS containing 1% BSA and specific antibodies
indicated. The cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat
antirabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 568 goat antimouse IgG (Life Technologies
Inc.). After washing, coverslips were mounted on the slides with one
drop of Antifade reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). Protein localization was determined
using a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (filters: 406
nm for DAPI, 488 nm for Fluor 488, and 543 nm for Fluor 568).

Subcellular
Fractionation
The experiment was carried
out as described in ref () with modifications. Briefly, two plates (100 mm) of 85%
confluent cells stably expressing wild type or mutant ABCG1 were collected
and resuspended in 2.0 mL of ice-cold, low ionic strength buffer C
(10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2) containing
1X Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors. The cells were then disrupted
with 40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer with a loose-fitting pestle.
The homogenates were then made isotonic by the addition of 0.4 mL
of 1.46 M sucrose in buffer C. The samples were centrifuged at 10 000g for 15 min at 4 °C. Next, 2 mL of the supernatant
was loaded on top of 10 mL of linear sucrose gradient (10%–40%).
Samples were centrifuged at 335 000g for 20
h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 1 mL fractions were collected
from the top to the bottom of the gradient, precipitated with TCA
and subjected to SDS-PAGE (8–20%) and immunoblotting as described
above.

Statistics
All statistical analyses were carried out
by GraphPad Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad Software) and SPSS. Student’s t test was used to determine the significant differences
between wild type ABCG1 and each mutant ABCG1. The significant differences
between groups were also analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Significance
was defined as p &lt; 0.05. Results are presented
as mean ± SD.

Results
Effect of the Conservative
Sequence on ABCG1-Mediated Cellular
Sterol Efflux
The G subfamily members are different from
other ABC transporters. They contain an NH2-terminal cytoplasmic
NBD. We found that, in addition to the traditional conserved motifs
in the NBD, the five ABCG subfamily members contain one single highly
conserved sequence existing between the NBD and the transmembrane
domain. This sequence contains five amino acid residues (Asn, Pro,
Ala, Asp, and Phe) in all G family members except for ABCG5, in which
it is NPFDF (Figure A). This sequence is also
completely conserved among different species of ABCG1. We replaced
Asn 316, Pro 317, Asp 319, and Phe 320 in ABCG1 with Ala simultaneously
(NPDF-A) to investigate their potential roles in ABCG1-mediated sterol
efflux. As shown in Figure B, the expression
levels of NPDF-A and wild type ABCG1 were comparable in transiently
transfected HEK 293 cells. However, cells expressing mutant NPDF-A
showed a significant reduction in cholesterol efflux compared with
cells expressing wild type ABCG1 (Figure C).

Next, we substituted Asn316, Pro317, Asp319, and Phe320 with Ala
individually to determine the roles of these amino acid residues in
ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux. The wild type and mutant ABCG1
were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and showed comparable protein
levels (Figure A). Mutations P317A and D319A
had no significant effect on ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux (Figure A, lanes 4 and 5). On the other hand, mutations
N316A and P320A significantly reduced cellular cholesterol efflux
compared with wild type ABCG1 (Figure A, lanes
3 and 6).

Effects of individual residues within the conserved sequence on
ABCG1-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux. Panels A and B: Cholesterol
efflux to lipidated apoA-I. The experiments were carried out as described
in Figure C. Samples tested are indicated
in the figures. Values are mean ± SD of at least 3 independent
experiments. The bottom figures in Panels A and B were representative
figures showing protein levels. Expression of wild type and mutant
ABCG1 in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing wild type and mutant
ABCG1 was determined as described in Figure B except that ABCG1 was detected with a polyclonal anti-ABCG1 antibody,
4497. Calnexin was detected with a mouse monoclonal anticalnexin antibody.
Antibody binding was detected using IRDye-labeled goat antimouse or
antirabbit IgG (Li-Cor). The signals were detected by a Licor Odyssey
Infrared Imaging System. Panel C: 7-ketocholesterol efflux to lipidated
apoA-I. The experiment was performed as described in the legend to
Figure C except that the cells were labeled
with [3H]7-ketocholesterol. Panel D: Cholesterol efflux
to lipidated apoA-I or rHDL. The experiment was performed as described
in the legend to Figure C. V: control cells.
WT: wild type ABCG1-expressing cells. Panels E and F: Cholesterol
and 7-ketocholesterol efflux to rHDL. The experiment was performed
as described in the legend to Panels A and B except that the acceptor
used was rHDL (5 μg/mL). Values are mean ± SD of one experiment
that was performed in triplicate. * or # indicates p &lt; 0.05; ** or ## indicates p &lt; 0.01; ***
or ### indicates p &lt; 0.001. *Compared with the
control cells that were transiently transfected with empty vector
(V). #Compared with wild type ABCG1-expressing cells (WT). Similar
results were obtained from at least one more independent experiment.

To further define how Asn316 and
Phe320 affected ABCG1-mediated
cellular cholesterol efflux, we mutated Asn316 to Asp (N316D) and
Gln (N316Q) and mutated Phe320 to Ile (F320I) and Tyr (F320Y). We
also made a double mutation N316AF320A, in which both Asn316 and Phe320
were mutated to Ala. A catalytic dead mutation K120M, in which the
conserved lysine residue located at position 120 in the Walker A motif
of ABCG1 was mutated to methionine, was used as a negative control
because it virtually eliminates ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux., Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates isolated from transiently
transfected HEK293 cells showed that wild type and mutant forms of
ABCG1 were all expressed at similar levels (Figure B). Mutation F320Y showed the same phenotype as wild type
ABCG1 (lane 8). However, when compared with cells expressing wild
type ABCG1, cells expressing mutant N316AF320A, N316Q, N316D, F320I,
or K120 M displayed reduced cholesterol efflux to lipidated apoA-I
(Figure B, lanes 3 to 7).

It has been
reported that ABCG1 mediates oxysterol efflux., Thus, we investigated whether mutations of Asn316 and Phe320 affected
the ability of ABCG1 to mediate cellular 7-ketocholesterol efflux,
the most abundant nonenzymatic oxysterol in the atherosclerotic lesions. As shown in Figure C,
when compared with cells transfected with empty vector, HEK 293 cells
expressing wild type ABCG1 or F320Y showed similarly increased efflux
of 7-ketocholesterol. However, mutations N316A, N316Q, F320A, and
F320I significantly reduced cellular sterol efflux compared with wild
type ABCG1.

Most recently, we made rHDL using purified recombinant
apoA-I and
examined the capacity of rHDL to mediate cholesterol efflux in HEK293
cells stably expressing ABCG1. We found that rHDL mediated ABCG1-dependent
cholesterol efflux more efficiently than lipidated apoA-I (Figure D). Thus, we examined the effect of ABCG1 mutants
on cellular cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol efflux to rHDL. As shown
in Figures E and F,
when compared with cells expressing wild type ABCG1, cells expressing
N316A, N316Q, N316D, and F320A displayed a significant reduction in
sterol efflux to rHDL. Mutation F320I also reduced cellular sterol
efflux to rHDL compared with wild type ABCG1, albeit to a lesser extend,
whereas mutations P317A, D319A, and F320Y had no significant effect.
These data were similar to what we observed in sterol efflux to lipidated
apoA-I. Taken together, our findings reveal the important role of
Asn at position 316 and Phe at position 320 of ABCG1 in cellular cholesterol
and oxysterol efflux conferred by ABCG1.

Effects of Mutations N316Q
and F320I on ABCG1 Stability
Next, we performed a pulse-chase
experiment to determine if mutations
on Asn316 and Phe320 affected ABCG1 stability. HEK 293 cells stably
expressing wild type or mutant N316Q or F320I were metabolically labeled
with [35S]-Met/Cys and then chased with excess Met/Cys
for the indicated time periods. As shown in Figure , at the 1 h time point (lane 5), the 35S labeling
of wild type (Figure A), N316Q (Figure B), and F320I (Figure C)
was reduced to approximately 50% compared to the 0 time point. At
4h (lane 7), the 35S labeling of wild type and mutant ABCG1
was reduced to around 15%. Thus, mutations N316Q and F320I did not
affect ABCG1 stability.

Metabolic labeling of cells with 35S Cys/Met. The experiments were performed
as described in . Briefly,
HEK293 cells stably
expressing wild type ABCG1 or mutant N316Q or F320I were metabolically
labeled with [35S]-Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml). ABCG1 was
immunoprecipitated from same quantities of total proteins and then
subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%). ABCG1 protein was detected by immunoblotting
with a polyclonal anti-ABCG1 antibody, 4497. 35S signal
was detected by X-ray film exposure. Similar results were obtained
from two more independent experiments. Top figures in each panel were
representative figures showing 35S signal levels and ABCG1
protein levels. Bottom figures in each panel were relative densitometry.
The densitometry was determined using Image J Analysis Software. The
relative densitometry was the ratio of the densitometry of 35S signal to that of ABCG1 protein signal at the same time point.
Percentage of relative densitometry was the ratio of the relative
densitometry of ABCG1 at different time points to that of ABCG1 at
time 0. Values are mean ± SD of three independent experiments.
The percentage of relative densitometry of ABCG1 at time 0 was defined
as 100%.

Effect of Mutations of
Asn316 and Phe320 on ABCG1 Oligomerization
ABCG1 is a half-transporter
and functions as a homodimer. Thus, we
studied whether mutations N316Q and
F320I had any effect on ABCG1 oligomerization. Coexpression of half
ABC transporters with two different tags, followed by immunoprecipitation
is a common technique to determine ABCG transporter oligomerization.,, We employed the same technique
to explore the homo-oligomerization of mutant ABCG1. ABCG1 was tagged
with a C-Myc or HA tag at its COOH-terminus (ABCG1-Myc and ABCG1-HA).
We first examined if C-Myc and HA tags affected trafficking of ABCG1
to the plasma membrane using confocal microscopy. As shown in Figure A, no ABCG1 signal was detected in mock-transfected
HEK293 cells. The distribution patterns of ABCG1-Myc and ABCG1-HA
in transiently transfected HEK293 cells were similar to that of untagged
wild type ABCG1, colocalized with the plasma membrane marker, Na+/K+-ATPase (Figure A, right).
Thus, C-Myc and HA tags did not affect ABCG1 trafficking to the cell
surface. Next, ABCG1-Myc and ABCG1-HA were transiently cotransfected
to HEK293 cells, and ABCG1-Myc was immunoprecipitated from whole cell
lysates. We observed that ABCG1-HA was coimmunoprecipitated with ABCG1-Myc
in the cotransfected cells (Figure.B, lane
6), indicating that ABCG1 forms homo-oligomers, consistent with previous
findings., Similar experiments were performed on cells
cotransfected with C-Myc- and HA-tagged mutant N316Q or F320I. As
shown in Figure B (lanes 7, 8), N316Q-HA and
F320I-HA were efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with N316Q-Myc and
F320I-Myc, respectively. Therefore, mutations N316D and F320I had
no significant effect on ABCG1 homo-oligomerization.

of N316Q and F320I on ABCG1 oligomerization.
Panel A: Immunofluorescence of ABCG1. The subcellular localization
of tagged and untagged wild type ABCG1 in transiently transfected
HEK 293 cells was determined by confocal microscopy as described in . Briefly, 48 h after transfection,
ABCG1 was detected using polyclonal anti-ABCG1 antibody (H-65). Location
of ABCG1 is indicated in green. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and
are shown in blue. The plasma membrane marker, Na+K+-ATPase, was detected using a monoclonal antibody and is shown
in red. Transfectants tested expressed either untagged or tagged wild
type ABCG1 as indicated in the figure. An x–y optical section of the cells illustrates the distribution
of the wild type and mutant proteins between the plasma and intracellular
membranes (magnification: 100×). Panel B: Immunoprecipitation
of C-myc tagged ABCG1. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with
a combination of wild type or mutant ABCG1-Myc and ABCG1-HA. C-Myc
tagged wild type or mutant ABCG1 was immunoprecipitated from same
amount of whole cell lysates and then were fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE,
followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody to detect HA-tagged
ABCG1. The same blot was also incubated with anti-ABCG1 antibody 4497
to detect total ABCG1 proteins. Similar results were obtained from
at least two more independent experiments.

Effects of Mutations on ABCG1 Trafficking
Several lines
of evidence have shown that ABCG1 is localized to the plasma membrane.,,,, Thus, we carried out biotinylation experiments
to investigate whether mutations on Asn316 and Phe320 influenced trafficking
of ABCG1 to the plasma membrane. We were able to detect wild type
ABCG1 but not calnexin in the cell surface proteins (Figure A, biotinylation, lane 2), suggesting that ABCG1
can be trafficked to the plasma membrane, consistent with previous
reports., Mutants NPDF-A, N316AF320A, N316D, N316Q,
and F320I all showed much less cell surface levels compared to the
wild type ABCG1 (Figure A, lanes 3 to 7),
even though the protein levels in whole cell lysates were similar
(Figure A, whole cell lysate, lanes 2 to 8).
However, mutation F320Y did not cause any reduction in the cell surface
ABCG1 (lane 8). Thus, mutations of Asn316 and Phe320 but not F320Y
affected ABCG1 trafficking to the cell surface.

Effects of mutations
of Asn316 and Phe320 on ABCG1 trafficking.
Panel A: Biotinylation of cell surface proteins. HEK293 cells transiently
expressing WT or mutant ABCG1 were biotinylated exactly as described
in . Biotinylated cell
surface proteins (biotinylation) and total proteins from whole cell
lysate were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. ABCG1 and
calnexin were detected using a polyclonal anti-ABCG1 antibody, H-65,
and a monoclonal anticalnexin, respectively. Similar results were
obtained from at least two more independent experiments. Panel B:
Immunofluorescence of wild type and mutant ABCG1. The subcellular
localization of wild type and mutant ABCG1 in stably or transiently
transfected HEK 293 cells was determined by confocal microscopy as
described in the legend to Figure A. ABCG1
was detected with H-65 and indicated in green. Nuclei were stained
with DAPI and shown in blue. The plasma membrane marker, Na+K+-ATPase was shown in red. Transfectants tested expressed
either wild type or mutant ABCG1 as indicated in the figure (magnification:
100× ).

To further confirm the
finding and determine the subcellular localization
of these mutations, we performed confocal microscopy on HEK 293 cells
stably expressing wild type, N316Q, or F320I. We also examined the
subcellular localization of mutations N316A, P317A, D319A, and F320Y
in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. ABCG1 was shown as green
(Figure B, left panel). The plasma membrane
marker, Na+/K+-ATPase, was shown as red (middle).
No ABCG1 signal was detected in mock-transfected HEK293 cells. As
shown in Figure B, a significant amount of
wild type ABCG1, as well as mutations P317A, D319A, and F320Y that
had no significant effect on ABCG1-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux,
were detected on the cell periphery (left), colocalized with the plasma
membrane marker Na+/K+-ATPase, and shown as
yellow (right). The subcellular distributions of N316Q, F320I, and
N316A were significantly different from that of the wild type protein.
In the merged panel (right), N316Q, F320I, and N316A were not overlapped
with Na+/K+-ATPase. Thus, taken together, mutations
N316Q, N316A, N316D, F320A, and F320I impaired ABCG1 trafficking to
the plasma membrane.

To further define the subcellular localization
of mutant ABCG1,
we next incubated the cells with an anticalnexin antibody (red, middle)
and observed that there were significant quantities of F320I were
colocalized with the ER marker (right), but the majority of N316Q
were not overlapped with the ER calnexin (Figure A). Next, we employed a cell fractionation assay to further
elucidate the subcellular distribution of mutant N316Q. HEK293 cells
stably expressing the wild type or mutant transporter were disrupted
and applied to a sucrose density gradient. The distribution patterns
of subcellular organelles in control, wild type ABCG1, or mutant N316Q-expressing
cells were the same. Thus, only the distribution of subcellular organelles
obtained from N316Q-expressing cells was shown in Figure B. We observed that wild type ABCG1 was present
in various fractions including the Golgi (GM130), the ER (calnexin),
the plasma membrane (Na+K+-ATPase), the late
endosome/lysosome (Rab11), and the early endosome (EEA1) (Figure B). The distribution pattern of N316Q was different
from that of wild type ABCG1. The majority of N316Q resided in fractions
6 to 8, which were partially overlapped with the late endosome/lysosome,
Rab11. Taken together, our data clearly show that mutations N316Q
and F320I impair proper cellular trafficking of ABCG1. The mutant
proteins were mainly localized intracellularly.

Effect of mutations N316Q
and F320I on ABCG1 trafficking. Panel
A: Immunofluorescence of wild type and mutant ABCG1. The experiment
was performed as described in the legend to Figure A. ABCG1 was detected with H-65 and indicated in green. Nuclei
were stained with DAPI and shown in blue. The ER marker, calnexin,
was shown in red (magnification: 100×). Panel B: Cell fractionation
of wild type and mutant ABCG1. Cell lysates were fractionated as described
in . Briefly, HEK293
cells stably expressing wild type or mutant ABCG1 were disrupted by
incubation with ice-cold, low ionic strength buffer C followed by
homogenization with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were made
isotonic and centrifuged. The supernatant was loaded on top of linear
sucrose gradient (10%–40%) and then subjected to centrifugation.
After that, 1 mL fractions were collected from the top to the bottom
of the gradient, precipitated with TCA, and subjected to SDS-PAGE
(8–20%). After electro-transferring, the membranes were cut
into halves between the 40 kDa and 30 kDa protein standards. The top
membranes were blotted with a polyclonal antibody, 4497, and a monoclonal
anti-GM130 antibody or with a polyclonal anticalnexin and a monoclonal
anti-Na+K+-ATPase antibody. The bottom membranes
were blotted with a monoclonal anti-EEA1 or a monoclonal anti-Rab11
antibody. Similar results were obtained from one more independent
experiment.

It has been reported
that substrates and modulators of P-glycoprotein
can function as chaperones to facilitate
processing of the misfolded P-glycoprotein mutants. On the other hand, the processing of misfolded
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutant,
delta F508, can be corrected when the culture temperature is reduced
to 26 °C. The direct substrates
of ABCG1 are not well understood. Thus, we examined if trafficking
of mutations N316Q and F320I was affected by reduced culture temperature.
As shown in Figure , wild type ABCG1 was colocalized
with Na+K+-ATPase. However, mutations N316Q
and F320I were still mainly localized intracellularly when the cells
were cultured at 26 °C. Thus, unlike CFTR delta F508, the processing
of ABCG1 mutants N316Q and F320I could not be rescued by reduced culture
temperature.

Immunofluorescence of ABCG1. The experiment was carried
out as
described in the legend to Figure A except
that the cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant
ABCG1 cDNA and cultured for 48 h after transfection under a 26 °C
incubator with 5% CO2. ABCG1 was detected with H-65 and
indicated in green. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and shown in blue.
The plasma membrane marker, Na+K+-ATPase was
shown in red (magnification: 100 × ).

Discussion
In the present study, we identified a highly
conserved sequence
present in all five ABCG family members and in different species of
ABCG1. The sequence that is located between the NBD and MSD contains
five amino acid residues, Asn, Pro, Ala/Phe, Asp, and Phe. Asn316
at the first position and Phe320 at the last position in the conserved
sequence of ABCG1 play an important role in regulating ABCG1 trafficking.
Replacement of Asn316 with Ala, Gln and Asp, or Phe320 with Ala and
Ile affected trafficking of ABCG1 to the cell surface and impaired
cellular cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol efflux conferred by ABCG1.
The mutant proteins were mainly localized intracellularly. However,
mutation of Phe320 to Tyr had no significant effect on ABCG1 trafficking
and sterol efflux activity.

Most recently, Tarling et al. reported
that ABCG1 is located in endosomes but not in the plasma membrane.
They proposed that ABCG1 functions as an intracellular cholesterol
transporter to transfer sterols to the inner leaflet of intracellular
vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane and deliver cellular
cholesterol to exogenous HDL. One unanswered question in this model
is how ABCG1 is removed from vesicles before they fuse with the plasma
membrane because no ABCG1 is detected on the cell surface in their
studies. On the other hand, several independent groups have shown
that ABCG1 is localized to the plasma membrane and to intracellular
organelles such as the Golgi and endocytic recycling compartments
in different cell types such as baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, HEK293,
HeLa, and THP-1 cells.,,,, Further, endogenous
ABCG1 in macrophages is redistributed from intracellular compartments
to the plasma membrane after treatment with an LXR agonist. Vaughan et al. reported that ABCG1 redistributes
cholesterol to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where cholesterol
can be removed by HDL. Thus, it is possible
that mutations on Asn316 and Phe320 disturb proper trafficking of
ABCG1 and, consequently, impair ABCG1-mediated cellular sterol efflux.

How do these mutations affect ABCG1 trafficking? One simple explanation
is that they may grossly disrupt ABCG1 structure and cause misprocessed
proteins. Mutations that significantly perturb protein structure are
unlikely to escape the surveillance machinery that traps misfolded
proteins in the ER and targets them for degradation., For example, misfolded mutants of the human P-glycoprotein
and CFTR are retained in the ER and rapidly degraded, resulting in
lower protein levels., However, mutations N316A and
F320I did not affect ABCG1 stability (Figure ). Thus, mutations of Asn316 and Phe320 may not result in a major
perturbation of the structure of ABCG1. It has been reported that
heterodimerization of ABCG5 and ABCG8 is required for trafficking
of ABCG5 and ABCG8 from the ER to the Golgi.,, Here, we found that mutations N316Q and
F320I had no effect on ABCG1 homo-oligomerization (Figure B). Studies in ABCA1 and ABCA3 transporters have
suggested that a conserved xLxxKN signal sequence located in the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain is required for the export of
the two transporters from the Golgi. Ala
mutation of the conserved signal sequence causes ER retention. The
author proposed that xLxxKN signal sequence functions as a Golgi exit
signal, targeting ABCA transporters to a post-Golgi sorting station
for further selective delivery. The NPADF sequence is completely conserved
in all species of ABCG1. Thus, it is possible that this sequence may
function as a selective trafficking signal to target ABCG1 to a proper
sorting station. The NPADF sequence is also completely conserved in
other ABCG family members, except for ABCG5 that has NPFDF. The cellular
localization of ABCG4 is unclear. However, ABCG2 is mainly localized
on the cell surface. ABCG5 and ABCG8
form a heterodimer in the ER and are transported to the apical membranes. The potential role of the NPADF sequence in
trafficking of these ABCG transporters remains the subject of ongoing
investigation. We also checked the presence of NPADF in several ER
proteins and found that they do not contain the NPADF sequence. Interestingly,
they all contain at least one NxxxF motif. For instance, ER resident
protein 44 contains N83QVVF and N174YRVF, protein disulfide-isomerase has N189SDVF and N224LLDF, eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 3 contains N39LEGF and N204IANF, calreticulin-3 has N42DSRF, endoplasmin
has N96KEIF, and calnexin contains N175LDQF and N404PDFF. Unlike ABCG1, which does not contain an ER retention
signal, these ER proteins have an ER retention signal, HDEL/KDEL/HVEL.
It will be of interest to investigate the potential role of the NxxxF
sequence in trafficking of these proteins.

ER cholesterol levels
play a critical regulatory role in the process
of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). The transport
of SREBP-2 from the ER to the Golgi for further processing is inhibited
when ER cholesterol levels are more than 5% of total ER lipids. ABCG1 has been shown to facilitate cholesterol
transfer out from the ER. Overexpression
of ABCG1 enhances process of SREBP-2 and increases levels of nuclear
form SREBP-2. Thus, regulation of ER-to-Golgi
trafficking of ABCG1 may play an important role in maintaining cellular
cholesterol homeostasis. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate the important role of the conserved sequence
NPADF in ABCG1 trafficking.
