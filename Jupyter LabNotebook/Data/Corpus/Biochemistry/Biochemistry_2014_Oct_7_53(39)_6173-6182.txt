For decades, epidemiological studies
have reported an inverse relationship
between the risk for developing coronary heart disease and plasma
concentrations of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs)., Indeed,
HDL protects against the development and progression of atherosclerosis
by several mechanisms, including reductions in oxidative damage, endothelial
dysfunction, and inflammation (reviewed in ref ()). A growing body of evidence
now strongly suggests that the “function” of HDL is
a better indicator of cardiovascular risk and has ignited an ongoing
debate about whether higher HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are truly
athero-protective.− This is especially important in light of a recent
Mendelian randomization
study that revealed a lack of association between a lowered risk of
myocardial infarction and genetic mechanisms that increase plasma
HDL-C levels.

Relevant to the studies
described herein, HDL is also known to
be athero-protective primarily by virtue of its role in reverse cholesterol
transport (RCT) whereby HDL transports cholesterol from peripheral
tissues to the liver for excretion via bile formation., In the final steps of RCT, scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI),
the most physiologically relevant HDL receptor, facilitates the selective uptake of cholesteryl ester
(CE) from HDL into hepatocytes for disposal., The selective uptake process involves two steps in which (i) HDL
must bind to the extracellular (EC) domain of SR-BI and
(ii) lipid alone is transferred from HDL to the plasma membrane, without
holoparticle uptake.− The selective uptake activity of SR-BI is not dependent
on other proteins, and our recent evidence
of the existence of SR-BI oligomers, supports the
notion that HDL-CE uptake occurs via a nonaqueous pathway, possibly
involving the formation of a “hydrophobic channel”.

The anti-atherogenic properties of SR-BI
and its ability to promote RCT are firmly established
by studies in mice and humans. Hepatic overexpression of SR-BI in
mice,, markedly lowered
HDL-C levels, enhanced cholesterol catabolism and excretion, and slowed
atherosclerosis.− On the other hand, a 50% reduction in the level of
SR-BI
expression or full disruption of the
SR-BI gene, in mice significantly increased
plasma HDL-C levels yet dramatically accelerated atherosclerosis.− More recently, mutations of SR-BI, identified in patients
with high HDL-C levels,, were associated with
impaired cholesterol transport functions., The correlation of elevated HDL levels with high levels of plasma
cholesterol is due to the dramatic defect in RCT resulting from SR-BI
deficiency and is a perfect example of
how the flux of
cholesterol
is a more important determinant of cardiovascular risk than steady-state
levels of HDL-C.

One approach to improving cholesterol flux
out of the body, and
ultimately HDL “function”, is to enhance the removal
of HDL-CE via SR-BI. A critical first step in developing new approaches
for promoting the selective uptake of HDL-CE requires a clear understanding
of the structural determinants underlying proper SR-BI/HDL alignment
via “productive complex” formation. SR-BI is a glycosylated cell surface receptor, that consists of a large EC domain anchored by two transmembrane
domains and two cytoplasmic domains. CD36,
a class B scavenger receptor with a predicted
topology similar to SR-BI, binds HDL but is unable to mediate efficient
HDL-CE selective uptake., This feature of CD36
was exploited to generate SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors., These “domain swap” chimeras were generated by exchanging
the cytoplasmic domains, the transmembrane domains, and/or the EC
domain of SR-BI with those of CD36. In these studies,, only chimeras containing the EC domain of SR-BI were able to mediate
selective uptake of HDL-CE regardless of the origin of the transmembrane
domains and/or cytoplasmic domains, thus establishing that the EC
domain of SR-BI is the sole requirement for the selective uptake of
HDL-CE. In fact, a spectrum of rather distinct SR-BI-mediated activities
appears to be an inherent property of the EC domain of SR-BI, including
the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol (FC), increased cellular
FC mass, and enhanced sensitivity of FC to exogenous cholesterol oxidase.,

To further define and characterize extracellular subdomains
within SR-BI that are required for cholesterol transport, we constructed
a series of 16 SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors that span the entire
EC domain of SR-BI to delineate regions that are essential for HDL
binding and HDL-CE selective uptake. Because CD36 binds HDL but cannot
mediate efficient selective uptake, we hypothesized that our entire
panel of SR-BI/CD36 chimeras would bind HDL at levels similar to that
of wild-type SR-BI, but only some chimeras would be unable to mediate
selective uptake of HDL-CE. We also anticipated that these chimeras
would provide insight into which subdomains are required for efflux
of FC to HDL and distribution of FC in the
plasma membrane.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
The
following antibodies were used: anti-SR-BI
antibody directed against either the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain
or the EC domain (Novus Biologicals, Inc., Littleton, CO), anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Millipore, Billerica, MA), peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG, and peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse
secondary IgG (GE Healthcare), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and
Alexa633-conjugated

g/mL) was purchased from Biomedical Technologies, Inc. [125I]Sodium iodide and [3H]cholesterol were purchased from
PerkinElmer,
and [3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether (COE) was purchased
from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). EZ-Link
sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and streptavidin agarose resin were obtained from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO),
cholesterol oxidase (Streptomyces), acyl:CoA cholesterol
acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor (i.e., Sandoz 58-035), and cholesterol,
4-cholesten-3-one, and cholesteryl oleate standards
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). All other reagents
were of analytical grade.

Plasmids
The murine SR-BI (GenBank
accession number Q61009) and rat
CD36 (GenBank accession number AAH72543) coding regions were cloned into
the pSG5 vector (Invitrogen) to produce pSG5[mSR-BI]and pSG5[rCD36] (herein termed
SR-BI and CD36, respectively). The following SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors
were generated by replacing the designated SR-BI sequence with the
corresponding region of CD36: SC(51–56),
SC(63–71), SC(75–79), SC(85–89), SC(92–98),
SC(140–148), SC(153–165), SC(184–192), SC(219–223),
SC(232–237), SC(271–277), SC(282–287), SC(297–302),
SC(370–375), SC(385–394), and SC(423–434). Cloning,
mutagenesis, and sequencing were performed by Top Gene
Technologies (Pointe-Claire, QC).

Cell Maintenance and Transfection
COS-7 cells were
maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin,
and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Cells were transiently transfected with
FuGENE 6 (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and as previously described. Cells were assayed 48 h post-transfection, with the exception of
free cholesterol efflux
assays, in which cells were assayed 72 h post-transfection.

Cell Lysis
COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type
SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were washed twice with cold
PBS (pH 7.4) and lysed with 1% NP-40 cell lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/mL
pepstatin, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/mL leupeptin,
and 10 μg/mL aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined
by the Lowry method as previously described.

Cell Surface Receptor Expression
Two methods were used
to assess receptor expression at the cell surface. Cell surface biotinylation
of SR-BI and SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors in transiently transfected
COS-7 cells was performed as
previously described. In separate experiments,
cell surface expression of
SR-BI and SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors was verified by flow cytometry
as described using the Accuri 6 cytometer (BD Biosciences; Blood Center
of Wisconsin) or FACS Calibur (Flow Cytometry Core, Medical College
of Wisconsin).

Receptor Oligomerization
COS-7 cells transiently expressing
wild-type SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were lysed in PBS
containing protease inhibitors. Receptor oligomerization was assessed
by 6% PFO–PAGE as previously described.

HDL Labeling, Cell Association of [125I]HDL, and
Uptake of [3H]HDL-COE
Human HDL was doubly radiolabeled
with nonhydrolyzable [3H]COE and [125I]dilactitol
tyramine as described previously. Preparations
of radiolabeled HDL had an average 3H specific activity
of 242.25 dpm/ng of protein and an average 125I specific
activity of 279.11 dpm/ng of protein. COS-7 cells
transiently transfected with cDNA encoding empty pSG5 vector, wild-type
SR-BI, or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were assayed for cell association
of [125I]HDL and selective uptake of nonhydrolyzable [3H]COE as previously described. Statistical analysis was conducted by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA).

Free Cholesterol Efflux and Cholesterol Oxidase
Sensitivity
COS-7 cells expressing the empty pSG5 vector,
wild-type SR-BI,
or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were prelabeled with [3H]cholesterol and assayed for the release of free
cholesterol from cells to HDL or for sensitivity to exogenous cholesterol
oxidase 72 or 48 h post-transfection, respectively, as previously
described. Statistical analysis was conducted
by one-way
ANOVA.

Results
Design of SR-BI/CD36 Chimeras
A detailed schematic
outlining the location of each chimeric region within the EC domain
of SR-BI is shown in Figure A. Murine SR-BI
and rat CD36 primary sequences were aligned using ClustalW [72% similar
sequences (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/)],
and protein secondary structure was predicted using Jpred analysis
[http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-jpred/ (Figure B)]. To generate a panel of chimeric receptors,
we chose regions of similar secondary structure, taking care to avoid
sites of N-linked glycosylation,, as well as
regions containing cysteine residues and disulfide bonds. We identified 16 small regions of interest that
were
suitable for swapping and that spanned the length of SR-BI’s
EC domain, with each region ranging in length from 5 to 13 amino acids.
Chimeras were named on the basis of the amino acids in the SR-BI sequence
that were swapped for the corresponding regions in CD36 as follows:
SC(51–56),
SC(63–71), SC(75–79), SC(85–89),
SC(92–98), SC(140–148), SC(153–165), SC(184–192),
SC(219–223), SC(232–237), SC(271–277), SC(282–287),
SC(297–302), SC(370–375), SC(385–394), and SC(423–434).

dashes for random coils.

SR-BI/CD36 Chimeric Receptors Are Expressed at the Cell Surface
cDNA encoding wild-type SR-BI and SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors
was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and examined for cell
surface expression using two different methods. First, we used receptor
biotinylation to assess the level of expression of chimeric receptors
at the cell surface (Figure A). Although all
chimeric receptors localize to the cell surface, five chimeras [SC(51–56),
SC(85–89), SC(153–165), SC(297–302), and SC(370–375)]
exhibited levels of expression lower than that of wild-type
SR-BI. With the exception of SC(51–56) and SC(297–302),
a lower level of expression for these chimeric receptors was confirmed
by flow cytometry analyses using antibodies directed against the EC
domain of SR-BI (Figure B). Interestingly,
flow cytometry analyses also revealed significantly increased levels
of expression of SC(92–98),
SC(219–223), and SC(282–287), which was not mirrored
by our biotinylation experiments.

SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors are expressed
at the cell surface.
(A) COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36
chimeric receptors were assessed for cell surface expression by sulfo-NHS-LC
biotinylation. Immunoblot analyses of biotinylated SR-BI at the cell
surface (from 150 μg of total lysate) (top panel) and in 20
μg of total cell lysate (middle panel) are shown using an antibody
directed against the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SR-BI. GAPDH
was detected as a loading control (bottom panel). Data are representative
of three independent experiments. (B) Surface expression of wild-type
SR-BI or SR-BICD36 chimeras in COS-7 cells assessed by flow cytometry
using an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of SR-BI.
Data are expressed as a percentage of SR-BI expression following subtraction
of empty vector values. Data are the average of at least nine independent
transfections. As determined by one-way ANOVA, *p = 0.01–0.05, **p &lt; 0.005, and ***p &lt; 0.001.

Chimeric Receptors Display Variable Ability To Bind HDL and
Mediate Selective Uptake of HDL-COE
To determine whether
swapping regions of the SR-BI EC domain with a corresponding region
of CD36 altered SR-BI function, wild-type and chimeric SR-BI/CD36
receptors were tested for their ability to bind HDL and mediate selective
uptake of HDL-COE following transient transfection in COS-7 cells.
Our analysis revealed that 11 of the 16 chimeric receptors [SC(63–71),
SC(75–79), SC(92–98), SC(140–148), SC(153–165),
SC(219–223), SC(282–287), SC(297–302), SC(370–375),
SC(385–394), and SC(423–434)] displayed a markedly reduced
ability
to bind HDL [ranging from 6 to 55% of that of wild-type SR-BI (Figure A)].
These decreases in the level of binding were accompanied by similar
decreases in the rate of selective uptake of HDL-CE (11–46%
of that of wild-type SR-BI) (Figure B).
The SC(271–277) chimeric receptor was also defective in HDL
binding and mediating
the uptake of HDL-CE; however, the decreases, though statistically
significant, were not as drastic. While SC(85–89) bound HDL
at levels similar to that of wild-type SR-BI, its ability
to mediate the selective uptake of HDL-CE was decreased by 30%. On
the other hand, while SC(75–79) and SC(297–302) exhibited
statistically significant decreases in their ability to
bind HDL, their ability to mediate the selective uptake of HDL-CE
was reduced, though not statistically
significant.

HDL binding and selective uptake of HDL-COE in cells expressing
wild-type SR-BI and SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors. COS-7 cells transiently
expressing wild-type SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were incubated
at 37 °C for 1.5 h with [125I]DLT/[3H]COE-labeled
HDL (10 μg of HDL protein/mL), after which cells were processed.
In parallel, cells were plated in separate wells to assess cell surface
expression by flow cytometry. Cell-associated HDL (A) and selective
uptake of HDL-COE (B), both normalized to cell surface expression,
are shown. Data represent means ± SD of at least three independent
experiments, each performed in triplicate. As determined by one-way
ANOVA, *p = 0.01–0.05, **p &lt; 0.005, and ***p &lt; 0.001.

Several Chimeric Receptors Display a Reduced
Ability To Stimulate
the Efflux of Free Cholesterol to HDL
Apart from its role
in facilitating HDL-CE uptake, SR-BI also has the ability to stimulate
the release of free cholesterol from cells.− Therefore,
COS-7 cells transiently expressing either
wild-type SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were assessed for
their ability to stimulate the efflux of FC to HDL acceptors. Analysis
of our panel of chimeric receptors revealed that seven chimeras [SC(63–71),
SC(92–98), SC(140–148), SC(153–165), SC(219–223),
SC(385–394), and SC(423–434)] displayed a marked reduction
in their
ability to stimulate the efflux of FC to HDL [45–79% decreases
in efflux compared to that of wild-type SR-BI (Figure )]. As noted above, these same receptors also had
an impaired ability to bind HDL and mediate selective uptake of HDL-CE.
Interestingly, despite the inability to bind HDL, SC(282–287),
SC(297–302), and SC(370–375) showed no differences in
their capacity to release FC from cells
to HDL as compared to that of wild-type SR-BI.

Efflux of [3H]cholesterol to HDL by wild-type SR-BI
and SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors. COS-7 cells transiently expressing
empty pSG5 vector, wild-type SR-BI, or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors
were prelabeled with [3H]cholesterol and incubated with
50 μg/mL HDL for 4 h at 37 °C to measure the efflux of
[3H]cholesterol to the HDL acceptor. Values represent means
± SD of eight independent experiments, each performed in quadruplicate.
As determined by one-way ANOVA, *p = 0.01–0.05
and **p &lt; 0.001.

Several Chimeric Receptors Display a Weakened Ability To Redistribute
Plasma Membrane Pools of Free Cholesterol
Upon addition of
exogenous cholesterol oxidase, a higher membrane content of cholestenone
reflects the ability of SR-BI to increase the size of the pool of
plasma membrane FC available for oxidation. COS-7 cells transiently expressing either wild-type
SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were assessed for their ability
to redistribute plasma membrane pools of FC upon treatment of cells
with exogenous cholesterol oxidase 48 h post-transfection. Analysis
of our panel of chimeric receptors revealed that five chimeras [SC(63–71),
SC(92–98), SC(140–148), SC(153–165), and SC(219–223)]
displayed significant decreases in their levels of cholestenone
production (Figure ), suggesting that these
chimeras were defective in their ability to redistribute FC in the
plasma membrane. It is interesting to note that receptors harboring
chimeric regions in the C-terminal half of the EC domain of SR-BI
displayed wild-type levels of cholestenone production, despite having
impaired abilities to mediate HDL-CE uptake and/or efflux of FC to
HDL. These observations reinforce the notion that the cholesterol
transport functions of SR-BI are separable, and that individual (possibly overlapping) regions of
the EC domain are responsible for each task of SR-BI.

Sensitivity of cells
expressing wild-type SR-BI and SR-BI/CD36
chimeric receptors to cholesterol oxidase. COS-7 cells transiently
expressing wild-type SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors were prelabeled
with [3H]cholesterol and incubated with 0.5 unit of exogenous
cholesterol oxidase for 4 h to determine cholesterol oxidase sensitivity.
Values represent means ± SD of three independent experiments,
each performed in quadruplicate. As determined by one-way ANOVA, *p = 0.01–0.05, **p &lt; 0.005, and
***p &lt; 0.001.

Impaired Function of SR-BI/CD36 Chimeras Is Independent of Oligomer
Formation
We, and others− have shown that SR-BI is able
to form dimers and
higher-order oligomers in cells and tissues. It is hypothesized that
oligomerization forms a “hydrophobic channel” that facilitates
the delivery of cholesterol from HDL to the plasma membrane.,− While the putative oligomerization domains are thought
to localize to the transmembrane domains,, it is certainly possible that regions within the EC domain of SR-BI
may also contribute to SR-BI oligomerization. To determine whether
exchanging small EC regions of SR-BI for corresponding areas in CD36
altered the ability of SR-BI to form multimeric complexes and facilitate
its normal cholesterol transport functions, we performed PFO–PAGE,
a variation of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed
in the presence of perfluorooctanoic acid, that is often used to evaluate
the molecular mass of homomultimeric membrane protein complexes.,− As shown in Figure , all chimeric receptors
displayed wild-type patterns of oligomerization with bands appearing
at ∼75, 150, and &gt;330 kDa, representing the monomer, dimer,
and higher-order
oligomer species, respectively. While the dimeric and oligomeric bands
do not appear clearly for the SC(153–165) chimeric receptor,
other blots (not shown) do show formation of
these complexes. These data suggest that the amino acids within the
swapped extracellular regions are not required for the formation of
multimeric SR-BI complexes.

SR-BI/CD36 chimeric receptors display wild-type
oligomerization
patterns. COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type SR-BI or SR-BI/CD36
chimeric receptors were lysed and subjected to 6% PFO–PAGE.
Protein bands were detected using an antibody directed against the
C-terminal tail of SR-BI.

Discussion
The goal of this study was to design chimeric
SR-BI/CD36 receptors
that would define the boundaries of small extracellular regions of
SR-BI that are responsible for its various cholesterol transport functions.
As CD36 binds HDL but is unable to mediate efficient selective uptake
of HDL-CE,, we hypothesized that all of the
chimeric receptors would bind HDL,
but only some would be unable to mediate selective uptake of HDL-COE.
Surprisingly, a majority of the 16 chimeric receptors were unable
to bind HDL and mediate the selective uptake of HDL-CE. Further, many
of these SR-BI/CD36 chimeras were also unable to stimulate the efflux
of FC to HDL or enhance the accessibility of membrane FC to exogenous
cholesterol oxidase. Together, our findings move the field forward
by identifying discrete subdomains of the extracellular domain of
SR-BI that are critical for this
receptor’s various cholesterol transport functions.

Constructing
chimeras between functionally distinct yet structurally
homologous receptors is a unique approach to mapping the functional
determinants of proteins.− For our studies, the use of SR-BI/CD36 chimeras was
ideal as the
two proteins belong to the class B family of scavenger receptors and
have EC domains sequences that are 72% similar. We used flow cytometry
and cell surface biotinylation analyses to demonstrate that all SR-BI/CD36
chimeras were present at the cell surface. The only differences noted
were for SC(51–56) and SC(297–302). This discrepancy
may be explained by variations in transient expression
of the mutant receptor in separate experiments.

Our analyses
revealed that the chimeras could be separated into
four different groups in terms of HDL binding and selective uptake
of HDL-CE. In the first group, SC(51–56), SC(184–192),
and SC(232–237) chimeric receptors had no effect on any of
the SR-BI-mediated functions
that were tested. Interestingly, replacement of residues 85–89
exhibited only 30% less CE uptake, despite 50% less expression of
this chimeric receptor at the cell surface. In the second group, as
would be expected, defective functions correlated with a decreased
level of cell surface expression, but for only SC(153–165)
and SC(370–375), suggesting some level of impairment in receptor
trafficking. In
the third group, impaired abilities to bind HDL and mediate the selective
uptake of HDL-CE were observed for SC(63–71),
SC(140–148), SC(271–277), SC(297–302), SC(385–394),
and SC(423–434), despite normal levels of expression at the
cell surface. In the
final group, SC(92–98),
SC(219–223), and SC(282–287) displayed extremely low
levels of HDL binding and selective uptake
of HDL-CE despite their high levels of cell surface expression (41–59%
higher than that of wild-type SR-BI).

In a previous study, we
designed nonconservative and conservative mutations at V67, L140/L142,
V164, and V221 to demonstrate that the hydrophobicity of this region
of the N-terminal half of the EC domain was critical for SR-BI’s
cholesterol transport functions. Many
of the chimeras tested in this study harbored swapped
residues that overlapped with these regions. Kyte–Doolittle
analysis of these swapped segments confirmed
that the hydrophobicity of these regions was indeed altered (data
not shown), corroborating our findings that changes in hydrophobicity
in this region of the N-terminal half of the EC domain of SR-BI have
an impact on receptor function. Recently, Neculai et al. published
the crystal structure for the EC domain of LIMP-2, a member of the class B scavenger receptor family to which
SR-BI
and CD36 also belong., By homology modeling, a structure
of the EC domain of SR-BI was inferred
and suggested the presence of a three-helix bundle that projects hydrophobic
side chains that may be required for HDL binding. Two of these α-helices
are fully replaced by our chimeras, SC(140–148) and SC(153–165),
and display defective HDL binding. Given that LIMP-2 shares 34%
sequence identity and 56% sequence homology with human SR-BI, the presence of a helix bundle in this area
of SR-BI
deserves extensive investigation.

The C-terminal half of the
EC domain of SR-BI contains cysteine
(Cys) residues that are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds, that most likely maintain the EC domain of SR-BI in a specific conformation
that supports its cholesterol transport functions. Although we took care to avoid Cys residues in the design
of our chimeric receptors, many SR-BI/CD36 swapped regions are located
between Cys251 and Cys384, the first and last extracellular Cys residues,
respectively, in the linear sequence of SR-BI. As such, we can speculate
that the impaired HDL binding and CE uptake abilities observed with
the chimeras within this region may be due to the fact that CD36 residues
could alter the conformation of this extracellular region in a manner
that prevents proper formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds.
Recently, mutation of a highly conserved proline residue at position
297 in SR-BI was discovered in patients with very high HDL-C levels. In our studies, SC(297–302) displays
an inability to bind HDL and a reduced ability to mediate
uptake of HDL-CE, which supports the findings of Vergeer et al. The only other known extracellular mutations
of human SR-BI are located
at Ser112 and Thr175, and do not reside in any of the
chimeric receptors generated for this study.

The findings from
this study are also consistent with other reports
that ascribe the various lipid transport functions of SR-BI to discrete
functional extracellular subdomains of the receptor.,,,, For example, three SR-BI/CD36 chimeras [SC(282–287),
SC(297–302), and SC(370–375)] exhibited normal levels
of efflux
compared to that of wild-type SR-BI, despite being unable to bind
HDL. The differences in these activities were independent of SR-BI
expression at the cell surface at 48 and 72 h, the times post-transfection
at which HDL binding
and FC efflux were measured, respectively (data not shown). The swapped
segments are all located in the same extracellular region that harbors
the Cys residues and intramolecular disulfide bonds. The normal levels
of efflux parallel our previous findings that suggest this region
of the C-terminal half of the EC domain of SR-BI may not be responsible
for efflux functions, even with possible disruptions in conformation
of this portion of the protein. Our findings
are also consistent with previous observations
that the efflux function of SR-BI is not dependent on HDL binding., Similarly, all chimeric receptors with swapped regions in the C-terminal
half of the EC domain of SR-BI were able to reorganize plasma membrane
pools of free cholesterol to an extent similar to that of wild-type
SR-BI, as judged by the membrane content of cholestenone upon addition
of exogenous cholesterol oxidase. Again, these findings are in agreement
with previous studies demonstrating that mutations in this region
of SR-BI do not affect the receptor’s ability to maintain accessibility
to exogenous cholesterol oxidase, and support
the notion that HDL binding is not required for this function of SR-BI.,

It has been hypothesized that the delivery of HDL-C to the
plasma
membrane is facilitated by the formation of SR-BI oligomers. We have previously reported that self-association
of
SR-BI is likely mediated by regions within the C-terminal half of
SR-BI. Specifically, this region possesses
a “GXXXG”
dimerization motif, as well as a putative leucine zipper, both of
which are known to mediate protein dimerization., Indeed, SC(423–434) disrupts both of these domains, and most
cholesterol transport functions
were impaired. However, PFO–PAGE analysis suggests that SC(423–434)
and all other chimeras maintain their ability to form oligomers.
On the basis of these data, we cannot exclude the possibility that
mutation of these motifs may not have been disruptive enough to prevent
oligomerization or that these motifs work in concert with other, as
yet unidentified, regions of the receptor that are responsible for
SR-BI oligomerization. Alternatively, the HDL binding site may differ
between the two proteins (i.e., it is located in two noninterchangeable
regions of CD36 and SR-BI). On the other hand, if the entire HDL
binding site in CD36 was indeed swapped into SR-BI, it is possible
that the secondary structure of CD36 differs from that of SR-BI, and
this portion of the receptor must interact or fold with other regions
of the CD36 EC domain (that are not present within the EC domain of
SR-BI) to function properly.

Taken together, our findings confirm
that the N-terminal region
is required for efficient efflux of FC to HDL and the ability to redistribute
FC in the plasma membrane, supporting our previous findings and suggesting that the hydrophobicity of this
region may be critical for efficient cholesterol transport. Further,
our data support the notion that while a specific fold or conformation
of the C-terminal half of the EC domain of SR-BI is required for mediating
proper binding to HDL and selective uptake of HDL-CE, disruption of
this region does not significantly impact the ability of this receptor
to facilitate the release of free cholesterol from cells to HDL. Creation
of smaller swapped regions between the two receptors or investigation
of the role of specific amino acids by site-directed mutagenesis may
help further define the discrete boundaries of the subdomains in the
EC domain of SR-BI that are responsible for its various cholesterol
transport functions.
