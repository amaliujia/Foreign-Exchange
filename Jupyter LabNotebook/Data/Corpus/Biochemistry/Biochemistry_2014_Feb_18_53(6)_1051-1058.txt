Pyruvate
carboxylase (PC, EC
6.4.1.1.1) is a member of the family of biotin-dependent metabolic
enzymes and supplies oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis and the replenishment
of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates that have been removed to
synthesize other molecules such as amino acids and fatty acids.− In vertebrates and many bacteria, the enzymic activity is tightly
regulated by the allosteric activator acetyl CoA., As
in the other biotin-dependent carboxylases, the initial step in the
reaction catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase involves the ATP-dependent
carboxylation of the biotin prosthetic group in the biotin carboxylase
(BC) domain active site. This reaction is thought to proceed via a
carboxyphosphate intermediate produced by the transfer of a phosphoryl
group from MgATP to bicarbonate, (Figure , reaction 1). This intermediate is then thought to decarboxylate
in the BC domain active site to produce carbon dioxide that carboxylates
the biotin (Figure , reaction 2). The carboxybiotin
thus formed then moves to the carboxyl transferase (CT) domain where
it transfers its carboxy group to pyruvate to form oxaloacetate (Figure , reaction 3). From the structure of Rhizobium
etli PC (RePC), and kinetic
analyses of mutant forms of the enzyme, Zeczycki et al. proposed a mechanism for the formation of carboxyphosphate
involving deprotonation of bicarbonate by Glu305, with transfer of
a proton to Glu218 that also interacts with Lys245 (see Figure ).

Partial reactions catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase that
together
form the overall pyruvate carboxylation reaction.

Reaction scheme adapted from ref () showing the proposed involvement of Glu218, Glu305,
and Lys245 in the nucleophilic attack of bicarbonate on MgATP, resulting
in the formation of carboxyphosphate in the BC domain active site
of RePC.

Another residue that is highly conserved in the active site
of
the BC domain is His216, which hydrogen bonds with the 3′-hydroxyl
group of bound MgATP and the carboxyl group of Glu218 in RePC and with the carboxyl group of the
equivalent residue in Staphylococcus aureus PC (Glu211). Thus, His216 provides a link between the bound
nucleotide and the residues that participate in the formation of carboxyphosphate
from bicarbonate and MgATP.

In this work, we explore the role
of His216 in the binding of MgATP
to the BC domain of RePC and the cleavage of ATP
resulting in the formation of carboxyphosphate as an intermediate
in the carboxylation of biotin.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
IPTG, malate dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase
were obtained from Roche. HisPur cobalt IMAC resin was obtained from
Thermo Scientific. All other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich

Construction of the RePC Mutants
Mutagenesis
was conducted on the 1.0 kb XhoI–SacII PC gene fragment corresponding to the allosteric domain using
a Quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations
were verified by DNA sequencing (Macrogen). The primers used to generate
H216N, E218Q, and E305A mutants were H216N-F (5′-GAGCGCGCCCGCAACGTCGAAAGCC-3′;
underlining indicates nucleotide substitution), H216N-R (5′-GGCTTTCGACGTTGCGGGCGCGCTG-3′),
E218Q-F (5′-GCCCGCCACGTCCAAAGCCAGATCC-3′),
E218Q-R (5′-GGATCTGGCTTTGGACGTGGCGGGC-3′),
E305A-F (5′-CGCATCCAGGTCCAACACACGGTGAC-3′),
and E305A-R (5′-GTCACCGTGTGTTGGACCTGGATGCG-3′),
respectively. The corrected mutations were verified by DNA sequencing
(Macrogen). The equivalent fragment of the wild-type RePC gene in the expression clone, was then replaced with
the mutagenized fragments.

Expression and Purification of RePC
The bacterium Escherichia coli BL21(DE3),
containing
the pCY216 plasmid, which encodes the E. coli BirA gene, was transformed with either the wild-type RePC or mutant RePC plasmid. The cultures
were grown in 8 L of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 6.25 g/L
arabinose, 10 mg/L biotin, 200 mg/L ampicillin, and 30 mg/L chloramphenicol
at 37 °C until an OD600 of 1.0–1.2 was reached.
The cultures were subsequently cooled on ice for 30 min, induced via
addition of 0.1 mM IPTG, and incubated for approximately 36 h at 16
°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4039g and 4 °C for 15 min. The harvested cells were disrupted
by incubation with 1 mg/mL lysozyme followed by mechanical disruption
of the cells using a Bead-Beater (Biospec). Nucleic acids were removed
from the lysate by protamine sulfate precipitation, and the total
proteins were subsequently precipitated with 36% (w/v) saturated ammonium
sulfate. The total proteins were then suspended in loading buffer
[300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO3, and 10 mM imidazole
(pH 7.4)] prior to being loaded onto 20 mL of HisPur cobalt resin. RePC was selectively eluted from the resin using elution
buffer [300 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO3, and 150
mM imidazole (pH 7.4)]. Purified PC was stored at −80 °C
in storage buffer containing 30% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH
7.8), and 1 mM DTE.

Determination
of the Biotin Content of RePC
Aliquots of
the enzyme were digested in triplicate with 0.2% (w/v)
chymotrypsin (Sigma) in 0.2 M KH2PO4 (pH7.2)
at 37 °C for 24 h followed by digestion with 0.45% (w/v) protease
from Streptomyces griseus at 37 °C for 48 h.
The biotin assay was performed as described by Rylatt et al. in triplicate. The enzyme concentrations mentioned
are determined by the total amount of enzymic biotin in the purified
wild-type and mutant RePC proteins.

Sedimentation
Analysis of the Enzymic Quaternary Structure
Sedimentation
velocity analytical centrifugation was performed
with a Beckman Proteome Lab XL-A (Beckman-Coulter, Palo Alto, CA)
ultracentrifuge using the absorbance optics system to visualize the
protein at a wavelength of 280 nm. Two-sector cells were used, and
data were acquired every 0.003 cm. Data were collected as 300 absorbance
scans with a nominal time increment of 1 min at 30 °C at a speed
of 40000 rpm. In all cases, enzyme samples were prepared at a concentration
of 1.56, 0.5, or 0.4 μM in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH7.8) and 1 mM DTE
with or without 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM pyruvate, and 0.1 mM
acetyl CoA. The computer-captured data were analyzed with SEDFIT. The partial specific volume of the enzyme was
calculated from the amino acid composition using SEDNTERP (http://www.bbri.org/RASMB). The density of the Tris-HCl buffer
(1.005 g/mL) was assumed to be the density of the enzyme solution.

Pyruvate Carboxylation Activity Assays
The initial
rates of the enzymatic carboxylation of pyruvate were determined using
a coupled spectrophotometric assay in which the oxaloacetate was converted
to malate using malate dehydrogenase. The concomitant oxidation of
NADH was measured by the change in absorbance at 340 nm. The enzymic activity was determined at 30 °C
in a 1 mL reaction mixture containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 6 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 20 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM pyruvate,
0.25 mM acetyl CoA, 0.22 mM NADH, and 5 units of malate dehydrogenase. kcat values were calculated by dividing the measured
reaction velocity by the biotin concentration of the RePC used in the assay.

Oxamate-Stimulated Oxaloacetate Decarboxylation
Assays
All assays were performed as described by Attwood
and Cleland at 30 °C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl
(pH 7.8) with
0.02 mM oxaloacetate, 1 mM oxamate, and 0.25 mM acetyl CoA. Assays
were initiated by the addition of the wild type to a final concentration
of 0.45 μM and H216N to a final concentration 0.64 μM;
however, prior to the addition, a background rate of oxaloacetate
decarboxylation was established, and this rate was subtracted from
the rate in the presence of the enzyme.

Steady-State Bicarbonate-Dependent
ATP Cleavage Activity Assays
The specific activities for
the wild-type- and H216N-catalyzed,
bicarbonate-dependent ATP cleavage were determined in triplicate using
a coupled spectrophotometric assay in which pyruvate kinase and lactate
dehydrogenase were used as coupling enzymes. The reactions were performed at 30 °C in a 1 mL reaction volume
containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 20 mM NaHCO3, 0.25
mM acetyl CoA, 10 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.22 mM NADH, 5 units of
pyruvate kinase, and 4 units of lactate dehydrogenase. MgATP concentrations
were varied between 1 and 400 μM, and free Mg2+ concentrations
were maintained at 5 mM by varying the concentration of added MgCl2.

Single-Turnover Bicarbonate-Dependent ATP Cleavage Activity
Assays
The rate of ATP hydrolysis by wild-type RePC was measured using a rapid chemical quench-flow instrument (RQF-3,
KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at a constant temperature of 30 °C
in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.25 mM acetyl CoA, 5
mM MgCl2, and 20 mM NaHCO3. A 19 μL mixture
of 1 μCi of an [α-32P]ATP solution (10 nM,
final concentration) was mixed with 19 μL enzyme solution (with
increasing reaction concentrations of the enzyme of 2, 3.5, 5, 7,
10, 20, and 40 μM). The reaction was quenched by 2 M HCl at
various times after initiation (between 0.1 and 80 s) and the mixture
expelled from the instrument; 1 μL of the quenched solution
was spotted onto a PEI-cellulose TLC plate prespotted with 1 μL
of a 20 mM ATP/ADP mixture and subsequently developed in an ATP/ADP
separation solution containing 0.5 M LiCl and 1 M formic acid. The
bands corresponding to ATP and ADP were visualized with a UV lamp
and cut into pieces, and radiolabeled nucleotides were quantified
by Cherenkov counting. From these measurements, the fractions of the
original ATP converted to ADP were calculated at the different reaction
times. To estimate the amount of ATP that spontaneously hydrolyzed
in the reaction time, [α-32P]ATP was mixed with water
instead of enzyme and analyzed, and any required corrections were
made to the sample data. To estimate the end point of the ATP enzymatic
hydrolysis, 19 μL of an enzyme solution was manually mixed with
19 μL of an [α-32P]ATP solution and the reaction
was allowed to proceed for 5 min, after which the reaction was quenched
by the addition of 280 μL of 2 M HCl. The fractions of the original
ATP converted to ADP were plotted versus reaction times, and first-order
exponential curves were fit by nonlinear least-squares regression
to estimate the observed first-order rate constant for MgATP cleavage
at each enzyme concentration. A secondary plot of these observed first-order
rate constants (kobs) versus enzyme concentration
was produced, and the data were fit to eq  using
nonlinear least-squares regression to obtain estimates of the Kd for the binding of MgATP to the enzyme and
the intrinsic rate constant (kcat) for
MgATP cleavage.

The
rates of ATP hydrolysis by H216N,
E218Q, and E305N mutant RePC were measured by manual
acid quench experiments. An enzyme solution was prepared containing
9 nM [α-32P]ATP (5 μCi), 0.25 mM acetyl CoA,
5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM NaHCO3 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 7.8), and increasing concentrations of the mutant enzymes (2.2,
4.5, 8.9, 17.8, and 35.6 μM) in a total volume of 100 μL.
Various times after the reaction had been started (0.5–20 min),
5 μL aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and added
to 40 μL of 2 M HCl. The rate constants of MgATP hydrolysis
at each concentration of the mutant enzymes, the Kd of MgATP binding, and the kcat of MgATP hydrolysis were determined as for the wild-type enzyme.

Phosphorylation of MgADP by Carbamoyl Phosphate
The
rate of ADP phosphorylation by carbamoyl phosphate was determined
for the wild type and H216N using a spectrophotometric assay in which
hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as coupling
enzymes. Reactions were performed at
30 °C in a 1 mL reaction mixture containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH
7.8), 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MgADP, 0.25 mM acetyl CoA, 0.5 mM
glucose, 0.5 mM NADP, 5 units of hexokinase, and 4 units of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase. Carbamoyl phosphate concentrations were varied between
0.5 and 40 mM.

Stopped-Flow Measurements of Mg·Formycin-A-5′-Triphosphate
(MgFTP) Binding to RePC
The fluorescence
measurement of the kinetics of Mg·formycin-A-5′-triphosphate
(MgFTP) binding and displacement by MgATP were as described by Geeves
et al., except experiments were performed
at 30 °C. A KinTek SF-2004 instrument (KinTek Corp.) was used
in these measurements. Excitation was at 310 nm, and a 350 nm cut-on
filter was used to monitor emission. Measurements were taken at 30
°C in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM NaHCO3. In binding experiments, the
solution of MgFTP (10 μM, final concentration) was rapidly mixed
with the solution of either wild-type RePC or H216
(0.5 μM, final concentration), and the trace of fluorescence
emission produced by the excitation of FTP with 310 nm light was recorded
using a 350 nm cut-on filter. In displacement experiments, the solution
of preformed complex MgFTP·WT or MgFTP·H216N (10 μM
MgFTP and 0.5 μM wild type or H216N, final concentrations) was
rapidly mixed with the solution to give a final MgATP concentration
of 1 mM, and the kinetic trace of fluorescence quenching was recorded.

Results
Sedimentation Analysis of the Quaternary Structure of Wild-Type RePC and H216N
Table  shows
that from the analytical ultracentrifugation analyses, the distribution
of quaternary structures in H216N is very similar to that of the wild-type
enzyme in the presence and absence of acetyl, pyruvate, and MgCl2. This indicates that the mutation of His216 has not destabilized
the quaternary structure of the enzyme.

and Oxamate-Stimulated Oxaloacetate
Decarboxylation
The kcat values
for wild-type RePC- and H216N-catalyzed pyruvate
carboxylation are listed in Table . Thus,
the reaction catalyzed by H216N occurs at only 0.45% of the rate of
that catalyzed by wild-type RePC. The kcat values for oxamate-stimulated decarboxylation of oxaloacetate
are listed in Table . Thus, the rate of the
reaction catalyzed by H216N is 36% of that catalyzed by wild-type RePC.

From Table , H216N showed a 9-fold increase in Km for MgATP compared to that of wild-type RePC while having a kcat that was 19% of
that for the wild-type enzyme, resulting in a decrease in kcat/Km of 98% compared
to that of wild-type RePC. For MgADP phosphorylation,
H216N showed a 2.9-fold increase in Km for carbamoyl phosphate compared to that of wild-type RePC, and the kcat was only 1.3% of that
for the wild-type enzyme, resulting in a decrease in kcat/Km of 99.5% compared to
that of wild-type RePC (see Table ).

Single-Turnover Measurements of the Bicarbonate-Dependent
MgATP
Cleavage Reaction
Figure a shows
the time courses of bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage reactions
at various concentrations of wild-type RePC. At most
enzyme concentrations, the reactions were complete within 20 s, with
essentially all of the MgATP converted to MgADP. The rates of approach
of the reactions to completion are clearly dependent on enzyme concentration,
and Figure c shows a plot of the observed
first-order rate constants derived from fits of the data sets in Figure a to single-exponential processes (solid lines in
Figure a) versus the concentration of wild-type RePC. Figure b shows similar time
courses for reactions with mutant H216N, and in these cases, reactions
were mainly complete within 1200 s, indicating much slower reactions
were catalyzed by mutant H216N and those rates were also dependent
on the concentration of H216N. Figure d shows
a plot of the observed first-order rate constants derived from fits
of the data sets in Figure b to single-exponential
processes (solid lines in Figure b) versus
the concentration of wild-type RePC. The solid line
represents a fit of the data to eq . Similar
experiments were also performed with mutants E218Q and E305A (data
not shown). The values of Kd and kcat obtained from fits of the kobs data versus enzyme concentration to eq  for wild-type RePC and its mutants are listed
in Table . The values of Kd were similar for both wild-type and mutant forms of RePC, indicating that none of the mutations had large effects
on binding of MgATP to the enzyme. However, the mutations all had
very marked effects on kcat, with mutant
H216N having a kcat that was ∼1%
of that of wild-type RePC and those of E218Q and
E305A being ∼2%.

by Stopped-Flow Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Panels a and b
of Figure  show the time
course of the increase in fluorescence associated with the binding
of MgFTP to wild-type RePC and mutant H216N, respectively.
Panels c and d of Figure  show the time course
of the decrease in fluorescence as MgFTP dissociates from MgFTP·wild-type RePC and MgFTP·H216N complexes, respectively. The observed
first-order rate constants derived from fits of these data to single
exponentials are listed in Table . Both binding
and dissociation rate constants are similar for wild-type RePC and mutant H216N, indicating that the H216N mutation
has little effect on binding of the nucleotide to the enzyme and supporting
the observations from the single-turnover MgATP cleavage experiments.

Discussion
The mutation of His216 to asparagine does
not affect the stability
of the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Hence, the effects of the
mutation are due to direct effects on the reactions of the enzyme
and are informative of the role of this residue in those reactions.
His216 obviously has an important role or roles in catalysis as mutation
of this residue reduces the rate of the overall pyruvate carboxylation
reaction by &gt;99%. As might be expected, the main effects of the
mutation
lie in the reactions that occur in the BC domain of the enzyme where
MgATP cleavage and biotin carboxylation occur and not in the CT domain,
where pyruvate carboxylation itself occurs. This is evidenced by the
relatively weak effect of the mutation of His216 to asparagine on
oxamate-stimulated oxaloacetate cleavage that occurs in the CT domain
and the much larger effects on MgATP cleavage and MgADP phosphorylation
that occur in the BC domain.

Steady-state bicarbonate-dependent
MgATP cleavage is coupled with
biotin carboxylation and primarily rate-limited in the absence of
pyruvate by a combination of the rates of decarboxylation of carboxyphosphate
and carboxybiotin., The decrease in kcat for bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage observed
in mutant H216N may be as a result of a change in the rate-limiting
step, perhaps to that of the formation of carboxyphosphate. The increase
in Km in H216N may be in part due to a
decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for MgATP. From the structure
of the enzyme, His216 appears to play
a role in the binding of the nucleotide by interacting with its 3′-hydroxyl
group, with N1 of the imidazole ring of His216 positioned 3.0 Å
from the 3′-hydroxyl oxygen of the bound ATPγS (see Figure ). The strong effect of the His216 mutation on MgADP
phosphorylation in terms of the reduction in kcat indicates that His216 has a major role in the formation
of carboxyphosphate and the cleavage of MgATP. This is because carbamoyl
phosphate is an analogue of carboxyphosphate and the MgADP phosphorylation
reaction is analogous to the reverse of reaction 1 in Figure .

Reaction scheme showing
the proposed proton relay involving His216,
Glu218, and Glu305 in the BC domain active site leading to the deprotonation
of bicarbonate and the transfer of a phosphoryl group from bound MgATP
leading to the formation of carboxyphosphate (1). Carboxyphosphate
decarboxylates, and the resultant PO43– deprotonates biotin while the carbon dioxide carboxylates it; carboxybiotin
and Pi then leave the BC domain (2). Glu305 is deprotonated
by the solvent leading to reversal of the proton relay (3). When MgADP
dissociates, His216 moves away from Glu218. Note that bound Mg2+ ions are not illustrated for the sake of clarity.

To ascertain whether the major
effect of the H216N mutation is
on MgATP binding or the reaction in which the transfer of a phosphoryl
group from MgATP to bicarbonate occurs, the kinetics of the single-turnover
bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage reaction were measured. This
represents the first application of this kinetic approach to the study
of pyruvate carboxylase and provides a direct way of determining the
intrinsic rate constant of MgATP cleavage and the dissociation constant
of the enzyme·MgATP complex. The results described above clearly
show that the H216N mutation has little effect on the binding of MgATP
to the enzyme, but a very strong effect on the catalytic step in the
reaction compared to that of wild-type RePC. The
lack of an effect of the H216N mutation on nucleotide binding is supported
by the similarity of the kinetics of MgFTP binding and dissociation
between wild-type and H216N RePC. This indicates
that either the interaction between N1 of the imidazole of His216
and the 3′-hydroxyl group of MgATP (see Figure ) provides little in the way of binding stabilization or the
replacement of His216 with asparagine still allows this interaction
to occur in much the same way as with histidine. This lack of an effect
of the H216N mutation on MgATP binding suggests that its effects on
the steady-state bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage reaction are
largely due to the inhibition of the MgATP cleavage step itself. In
fact, the value of kcat determined from
the single-turnover experiment is very similar to the kcat determined in the steady-state experiments for mutant
H216N. This indicates that in the steady-state reaction, the phosphoryl
transfer step between MgATP and bicarbonate in mutant H216N has become
slow enough to be rate-limiting.

Similar single-turnover MgATP
cleavage experiments were also performed
with mutants E218Q and E305A. The resulting kinetics are remarkably
similar to those of the H216N mutant, with the mutations having little
effect on MgATP binding but strong inhibitory effects on the phosphoryl
transfer reaction itself. Because neither Glu218 nor Glu305 has direct
contact with bound MgATP in the BC domain active site, the lack of
an effect of mutation of these residues on MgATP binding is not unexpected.
As shown in Figure , in the active site of
the BC domain of RePC with MgATPγS bound, His216
is positioned to potentially form hydrogen bonds with both the 3′-hydroxyl
group of the nucleotide and the carboxyl group of Glu218, which in
turn could hydrogen bond with that of Glu305. In the BC domain with
no bound nucleotide, His216 moves away from and out of alignment with
Glu218, so that it no longer interacts so strongly with that residue.
This suggests that the binding of the nucleotide correctly positions
His216 to optimally interact with Glu218. The presence or absence
of the acetyl CoA bound to the subunit does not affect the positioning
of these residues, indicating that this is not a locus of activation
of the enzyme by this allosteric activator. In the presence of a bound
nucleotide, N3 of the imidazole ring of His216 is &gt;1 Å closer
to Glu218 than the side chain amino group nitrogen of Lys245, which
is closer to the γ-thiophosphoryl group of the bound ATPγS
and is indeed important for MgATP binding as shown by Zeczycki et
al.

If we accept the proposal of
Zeczycki et al. that Glu305 deprotonates
bicarbonate concomitant with the
transfer of a phosphoryl group from MgATP and there is a proton relay
system involving proton transfer from Glu305 to Glu218, how might
His216 fit into this scheme? We can postulate that the binding of
MgATP to the BC domain active site results in the repositioning of
His216 through its interaction with the 3′-hydroxyl group (see
Figure ). This places N3 of the imidazole
ring adjacent to the protonated carboxyl group of Glu218. If N3 is
unprotonated, it could extract the proton from Glu218, triggering
the series of proton transfers that ultimately results in the deprotonation
of bicarbonate and the formation of carboxyphosphate. Once biotin
has been carboxylated and leaves the BC domain active site, the proton
relay would be reversed and dissociation of MgADP from the active
site would result in the movement of His216 away from Glu218. The
positioning of residues and proton transfer leading to phosphoryl
transfer are coordinated by the binding of the nucleotide through
its interaction with His216.

If this proton relay scheme is
correct, the mutation of any of
the three residues involved would be expected to have a similar effect
on the catalysis of MgATP cleavage, which is exactly what was observed
in the single-turnover MgATP cleavage experiments described above.
Adina-Zada et al. measured pH profiles
of bicarbonate-dependent MgATP cleavage catalyzed by a mutant form
of PC from Bacillus thermodenitrificans that lacked
biotin and thus decoupled MgATP cleavage from biotin carboxylation.
A residue with a pK of 6.6 was observed in the pH
profile for the reaction; this residue needed to be deprotonated for
the reaction to occur and could correspond to His216. In the reverse reaction, His216 would need to be protonated
so that the transfer of a proton to carbonate could occur as MgATP
is formed from carboxyphosphate.

Apart from being well-conserved
among pyruvate carboxylases, residues
equivalent to His216, Glu218, and Glu305 in RePC
are also well-conserved among other biotin-dependent carboxylases,
including acetyl CoA carboxylase, propionyl CoA carboxylase, and methylcrotonyl
CoA carboxylase. This suggests that the proposed mechanism of coordination
of MgATP binding with catalysis and the proton relay mechanism is
also likely to occur in these related enzymes. The biotin carboxylase
subunit of acetyl CoA carboxylase also has an ATP grasp fold, as does carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, which shares some mechanistic similarities with
the biotin-dependent carboxylases. However, sequence alignments show
that in the carbamoyl phosphate synthetases, the residues equivalent
to His216 and Glu305 in RePC are glutamate and serine,
respectively (Glu215 and Ser307, respectively, in the E. coli enzyme). In the structure of E. coli carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase, Glu215 interacts with both the 2′- and
3′-hydroxyls of the bound nucleotide but is not positioned
to interact with Glu217 (the residue equivalent to Glu218 in RePC). Thus, the proposed proton relay mechanism may be
restricted to the biotin-dependent carboxylases.

In this work,
we have provided evidence that supports the proposal
that three residues in the BC domain active site of RePC form a proton relay system to promote the phosphorylation of bicarbonate.
We have also proposed that the binding of the nucleotide in the BC
domain active site repositions His216 to establish this proton relay
system; thus, His216 coordinates catalysis with substrate binding.
