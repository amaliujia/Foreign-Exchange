Here we report the first complete
structure of a bacterial Fe–S l-serine dehydratase
determined to 2.25 Å resolution. The
structure is of the type 2 l-serine dehydratase from Legionella pneumophila that consists of a single polypeptide
chain containing a catalytic α domain and a β domain that
is structurally homologous to the “allosteric substrate binding”
or ASB domain of d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The enzyme exists as a dimer
of identical subunits, with each subunit exhibiting a bilobal architecture.
The [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster is bound by residues from the C-terminal
α domain and is situated between this domain and the N-terminal
β domain. Remarkably, the model reveals that the C-terminal
cysteine residue (Cys 458), which is conserved among the type 2 l-serine dehydratases, functions as a fourth ligand to the iron–sulfur
cluster producing a “tail in mouth” configuration. The
interaction of the sulfhydryl group of Cys 458 with the fourth iron
of the cluster appears to mimic the position that the substrate would
adopt prior to catalysis. A number of highly conserved or invariant
residues found in the β domain are clustered around the iron–sulfur
center. Ser 16, Ser 17, Ser 18, and Thr 290 form hydrogen bonds with
the carboxylate group of Cys 458 and the carbonyl oxygen of Glu 457,
whereas His 19 and His 61 are poised to potentially act as the catalytic
base required for proton extraction. Mutation of His 61 produces an
inactive enzyme, whereas the H19A protein variant retains substantial
activity, suggesting that His 61 serves as the catalytic base. His
124 and Asn 126, found in an HXN sequence, point toward the Fe–S
cluster. Mutational studies are consistent with these residues either
binding a serine molecule that serves as an activator or functioning
as a potential trap for Cys 458 as it moves out of the active site
prior to catalysis.

Given that l-serine
serves as a major source of one-carbon units for methylation reactions,
it is not surprising that its metabolism is a tightly regulated process.1 Indeed, high rates of serine biosynthesis have
been reported in human colon carcinoma, rat sarcoma, and rat hepatoma
cell lines, attesting to a possible role in tumor cell growth.2,3 In many bacteria, defects in the phosphorylated pathway of l-serine production result in auxotrophy,4,5 whereas
high levels of l-serine can be toxic.6

All organisms contain enzymes that specifically deaminate l-serine to produce pyruvate and ammonia. In eukaryotes, these
enzymes
utilize pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) for activity, and they
are believed to function in metabolism by providing pyruvate for gluconeogenesis
and the citric acid cycle. Strikingly, in bacteria, the serine dehydratases
contain Fe–S clusters rather than PLP.7−9 Most, if not
all bacteria, produce at least one Fe–S l-serine dehydratase,
and some, such as Escherichia coli, produce several
that are differentially expressed.8,10 The ubiquitous
nature of these enzymes attests to their fundamental importance, but
it is not known why bacterial l-serine dehydratases utilize
an Fe–S cluster rather than PLP. Recent reports suggest that
these enzymes play a protective role in guarding against high intracellular l-serine levels that are detrimental to the organism. In E. coli, high serine levels interfere with incorporation
of alanine into the peptidoglycans at a critical point in cell wall
synthesis.10,11 In some mycobacteria that are
missing l-serine dehydratase, high serine levels inhibit
growth by blockage of glutamine synthetase,12 and in Campylobacteri jejuni, l-serine
dehydratases are essential for host colonization.13 Importantly, the l-serine dehydratases must function
in a manner that does not deplete the levels of l-serine
required for viability. They appear to accomplish this task by maintaining
a high Km for l-serine along
with a high kcat for efficient turnover.8,14

The bacterial Fe–S l-serine dehydratases from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus(15) and E. coli(8) have been
shown to contain a diamagnetic [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster in which
three of the irons are thought to be ligated by cysteine residues
whereas the fourth presumably interacts with the substrate, similar
to that observed in aconitase.16 A potential
catalytic mechanism for l-serine dehydratase is shown in
Scheme 1. The model is based on mechanistic
studies with aconitase and other 4Fe-4S dehydratases.8,9,14 Most nonredox 4Fe-4S proteins
contain a cubane structure in which three of the four iron atoms are
ligated to protein cysteine residues. Using aconitase as a model,
the fourth iron is generally described as the catalytic metal that
is ligated to water and interacts directly with the substrate according
to the general mechanism depicted in Scheme 1. A catalytic base extracts a proton from the α carbon, and
the Fe–S cluster acts as a Lewis acid, which coordinates the
leaving hydroxyl group of the substrate. The aminoacrylate dehydration
product is protonated at the β carbon to form iminopyruvate
that is subsequently rehydrated with the loss of ammonia to form pyruvate.
Site-directed mutagenesis studies with the Legionella pneumophilal-serine dehydratase have revealed that the critical cysteines
are found in a C-X41-C-X10-C sequence pattern.14

Scheme 1 At least four
types of Fe–S l-serine dehydratases
that differ in their domain content and arrangement have been identified.17 They all contain a catalytic or α domain
that harbors the binding site for the Fe–S cluster as well
as a β domain whose function has not yet been completely defined.
In the type 1 enzymes, the α and β domains are found on
separate polypeptide chains, whereas in types 2–4, they are
located on a single polypeptide chain.17,18 In the type
2 and 4 enzymes, the β domain is found at the N-terminus, whereas
in the type 3 enzymes, the β domain is located at the C-terminus.
A partial structure of the L. pneumophilal-serine dehydratase representing the β domain alone (residues
11–161), determined in 2006 by the Midwest Center for Structural
Genomics, revealed that its fold had a molecular architecture similar
to that of the “allosteric substrate binding” or “ASB”
domain observed in some d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases.14 The d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases
function in metabolism by catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step
in serine biosynthesis.1 The β domains
of type 1, 3, and 4 l-serine dehydratases contain an additional
segment of polypeptide that appears to be similar to the “ACT”
domain also found in the d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases.
In addition, type 1 and 3 l-serine dehydratases require potassium
for activity, whereas the type 2 enzymes do not.18

The ASB domain in d-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
functions
in enzyme regulation by binding substrate, and possibly phosphate,
which act as allosteric effectors.19,20 It is thought
that the ASB domain plays a similar role in the l-serine
dehydratases by binding serine as an allosteric ligand. Activation
by l-serine binding at a second, noncatalytic site has been
demonstrated by kinetic analysis of the type 2 enzyme from L. pneumophila, although the location of the effector binding
site has not yet been directly demonstrated to reside in the β
domain.18,21 The bacterial Fe–S l-serine
dehydratases represent only the second group of proteins in which
ASB domains have been found.17 Interestingly,
both the l-serine dehydratases and the d-3-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenases are involved in some aspect of l-serine metabolism.

Here we report the first complete structure of the L. pneumophilal-serine dehydratase determined to 2.25 Å resolution.
Each subunit of the dimeric enzyme adopts a distinctly bilobal architecture
with the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster situated between the N- and
C-terminal domains. Remarkably, the model reveals that the C-terminal
cysteine residue, which is conserved among the type 2 l-serine
dehydratases, functions as a ligand to the iron–sulfur cluster
through a “tail in mouth” configuration. The molecular
architecture described herein serves as a paradigm for the bacterial l-serine dehydratases in general.

Materials and Methods
Cloning
of the Gene Encoding Serine Dehydratase
The
gene encoding L. pneumophilal-serine dehydratase
was cloned from genomic DNA obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection as previously described.14 It
was placed between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pSV281, which provided
a hexahistidine tag at the N-terminus of the protein after expression.

Protein Expression and Purification
BL21 DE3 cells
containing the plasmid were grown in lysogeny broth medium supplemented
with kanamycin at 37 °C with shaking until an optical density
of 0.5–0.7 was reached at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced
via the addition of 3 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside,
and the cells were grown until an optical density of 1–3 was
reached at 600 nm. The cells were recovered by centrifugation, suspended
in buffer [50 mM MOPS (pH 7.0) or 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0)],
and lysed by sonication in an anaerobic chamber in the presence of
0.16 mg/mL lysozyme and then treated with 5 mg of DNAase after being
stirred for 10 min. Protein was purified in the anaerobic chamber
on a Talon Cobalt metal affinity column using standard procedures.14,21 Mutant proteins were prepared by PCR as previously described22 and purified in the same manner that was used
for the wild-type enzyme.

Kinetic Analysis
Activity was measured
by following
the absorbance of product (pyruvate) formation at 250 nm.14 The concentration of the active enzyme was determined
from the charge transfer absorbance of the Fe–S center at 400
nm using an extinction coefficient of 13750 M–1 cm–1. The kinetic parameters, kcat and Km, were determined by fitting the l-serine concentration-dependent plot to the cooperative Michaelis–Menten
equation 1  where v is the velocity as
a function of substrate concentration, V is the maximal
velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, Km is the Michaelis constant, n is the Hill
coefficient, and kcat is V/[Et]. Double-reciprocal plots were fit by linear regression
analysis, which yielded values for the slopes. Slope replots and plots
of velocity versus inhibitor concentration at a constant substrate
concentration were produced as described by Segel.23 Slope replots were fit either by linear regression analysis
or in the case of d-serine to a second-degree polynomial.
The values for Ki were estimated graphically
where the x-axis intercept equals −Ki. The data points in plots of velocity versus
inhibitor concentration were connected from point to point using the
smooth fit function of Kaleidograph and are used only to show either
linear or plateauing functionality. Linearity indicates that the velocity
can be driven to zero at an infinite inhibitor concentration, consistent
with simple competitive inhibition. A plateau demonstrates that activity
cannot be driven to zero at an infinite inhibitor concentration indicating
partial inhibition.

Size Exclusion Chromatography
Protein
(8–10
mg/mL) isolated in the anaerobic chamber was applied to a 1.6 cm ×
100 cm column of Sephacryl S-200 at ambient room atmosphere and developed
with 50 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) that had been deoxygenated in the
anaerobic chamber. Fractions were assayed for catalytic activity,
and the absorbance at 280 nm was measured.

Protein Expression and
Purification for X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The pSV281-lpLSD plasmid was used to transform
Rosetta2(DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen). The cultures
were grown in M9 medium supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol
at 37 °C with shaking until an optical density of 1.0 was reached
at 600 nm. Methionine biosynthesis was suppressed by the addition
of lysine, threonine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine,
and selenomethionine, and 10 mg/L ferrous ammonium sulfate was also
added. After an additional 30 min, the flasks were cooled to room
temperature, and protein expression was initiated by addition of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM.
The cells were allowed to express protein for 18 h before being harvested.

Protein purification was performed in a COY anaerobic chamber at
ambient temperature. The cells were lysed using 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme
in standard lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM NaCl, and
20 mM imidazole (pH 8)]. After cell lysis was complete, 0.05 mg/mL
DNaseI was added for nucleotide degradation. The lysed cells were
subsequently sealed in centrifuge bottles and spun at 45000g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column,
and after being rigorously washed, the protein was eluted with 50
mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole (pH 8). The
sample was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl.
After dialysis, the protein concentration was adjusted to approximately
10 mg/mL based on an extinction coefficient of 2.16 mg–1 mL cm–1 at 280 nm. Dithiothreitol was added to
a final concentration of 8 mM. The Fe–S cluster was reconstituted
by adding an 8-fold molar excess of FeCl3 dropwise (100
mM stock) over 15 min, followed by a similar addition of Na2S. The mixture was allowed to stir for 5 h, followed by dialysis
against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl. The solution was
diluted with 3 volumes of 50 mM CHES (pH 9) and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose
column that had been equilibrated in the same buffer (pH 9). The protein
was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 800 mM NaCl and dialyzed
against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mM NaCl. The final protein
concentration was 15 mg/mL.

Crystallization
Crystallization
conditions were initially
surveyed in a COY anaerobic chamber at ambient temperature by the
hanging drop method of vapor diffusion using a laboratory-based sparse
matrix screen. Single crystals were subsequently grown via vapor diffusion
against 100 mM homopipes (pH 5.0), 9–13% poly(ethylene glycol)
3400, and 200 mM tetramethylammonium chloride. The crystals grew to
maximal dimensions of ∼0.4 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.05 mm
in 2 weeks. They belonged to space group P3121 with the following unit cell dimensions: a = b = 81.4 Å, and c = 267.5 Å.
There was one dimer in the asymmetric unit.

Structural Analysis
Prior to X-ray data collection,
the crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing
20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 15% ethylene glycol, 250 mM NaCl,
250 mM tetramethylammonium chloride, and 100 mM homopipes (pH 5.0).
X-ray data were collected at the Structural Biology Center beamline
19-BM at a wavelength of 0.9794 Å (Advanced Photon Source). The
X-ray data were processed and scaled with HKL3000.24 Relevant X-ray data collection statistics are listed in

Results and Discussion
Overall
Molecular Architecture of the Fe–S l-Serine Dehydratase
A previous report on an l-serine
dehydratase from E. coli indicated that it exists
as a dimer in solution.8 Crystals used
in this investigation belonged to the space group P3121 with two subunits in the asymmetric unit. To confirm
the quaternary structure of the L. pneumophila enzyme,
we used size exclusion chromatography. Chromatography of the purified
enzyme on a Sephacryl S-200 column showed a single main peak with
a trailing shoulder (Figure 1). After elution
from the column, the enzyme retained significant activity that corresponded
to the main absorbance peak. The molecular weight of the main peak
was determined to be 95500 and that of the shoulder to be approximately
56200. These molecular weights correspond well to the calculated molecular
weights of 98952 and 49476 for dimeric and monomeric molecules, respectively.
This is consistent with a monomer–dimer equilibrium under the
conditions used for the chromatography, with only the dimer exhibiting
catalytic activity. Furthermore, these data suggest that the dimer–dimer
contacts are critical to the catalytic integrity of the active site
and may have implications concerning the relationship of in
vivo activity and enzyme expression levels.

Figure 1 Size exclusion chromatography
of the L. pneumophila dehydratase. The enzyme was
run on a 1.6 cm × 100 cm column
of Sephacryl S-200. The absorbance at 280 nm (●) and the enzyme
activity (○) are plotted as a function of elution volume.

Overall, the quality of the electron
density for both polypeptide
chains in the asymmetric unit was excellent with the exceptions of
several surface loops (breaks between Lys 161–Asn 167 and Ile
250–Phe 259 in subunit A and between Asp 160–Asn 167
and Lys 332–Ser 337 in subunit B). Shown in Figure 2a is a ribbon representation of the serine dehydratase
dimer. It has overall dimensions of ∼100 Å × 80 Å
× 60 Å and a total buried surface area of 4800 Å2. The iron–sulfur clusters are separated by ∼25
Å. There are three cis-peptide bonds at Pro
15, Pro 289, and Pro 395. Both Pro 15 and Pro 289 reside approximately
10 Å from the active site, whereas Pro 395 abuts one side of
the iron–sulfur cluster. Shown in Figure 2b is a stereoview of one subunit, which is distinctly bilobal in
architecture. The N-terminal or β domain, delineated by Met
1–Lys 161, is dominated by a five-stranded mixed β sheet
that is flanked on one side by four α helices. The C-terminal
domain, which harbors the active site cluster, is composed of 11 α
helices. Given that the α carbons for the two subunits of the
dimer superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.25 Å,
the following discussion will refer only to subunit B.

Figure 2 Structure of the L. pneumophila dehydratase. A
ribbon representation of the dimer is presented in panel a with the
metal clusters depicted in space-filling representations. A stereoview
of one subunit of the enzyme is displayed in panel b. The N-terminal
β-domain is colored light blue, whereas the C-terminal α
domain is shown in purple. This figure and Figures 3 and 5–7 were prepared with PyMOL.33

The electron density corresponding to the iron–sulfur
cluster
is presented in Figure 3a. Unexpectedly, the
C-terminal cysteine residue, Cys 458, serves as a ligand to the iron–sulfur
cluster. As indicated in Figure 3b, the C-terminal
carboxylate group is hydrogen bonded into the active site via the
backbone amide groups of Ser 16 and Ser 18 and the side chains of
Ser 18 and Thr 290. In addition, the side chain of Ser 16 lies within
hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of Glu 457. Both
Ser 16 and Ser 18 are part of the β domain. The other ligands
to the irons are Cys 343, Cys 385, and Cys 396. Importantly, the position
of Cys 458 serves as an excellent mimic for where the natural substrate, l-serine, binds as discussed further below.

Figure 3 Active site of the L. pneumophila dehydratase.
The observed electron density for the iron–sulfur cluster is
shown in panel a. The map, contoured at 3σ, was calculated with
coefficients of the form F0 – Fc, where F0 is the
native structure factor amplitude and Fc the calculated structure factor amplitude. A close-up view of the
active site is displayed in panel b. The dashed lines indicate potential
hydrogen bonds.

Catalytic Activity with
Other Amino Acids
Since the
substrate of the enzyme is an amino acid, which is also thought to
act as an allosteric effector, all of the other naturally encoded l-amino acids as well
as d-serine and l-cystine (CysS-SsyC) were tested
for their ability to act as substrates or inhibitors. Previously, l-cysteine and d-serine were reported to be competitive
inhibitors of the type 2 dehydratase from E. coli,8 and l-cysteine was reported
to be a competitive inhibitor of the type 1 dehydratase from P. asaccharolyticus.31 The only
other amino acid besides l-serine that shows catalytic activity
with the L. pneumophila enzyme studied in this investigation
is l-threonine, but only at a very low level. Specifically,
it exhibits approximately 3% of the level of activity seen with l-serine and shows a Km of 288 mM
compared to a Km of 2 mM for l-serine for the wild-type enzyme. The Hill coefficient for l-threonine is 2.3 ± 0.5 compared to a value of 1.40 ± 0.04
for l-serine. The apparent cooperativity is likely due to
the different affinities of the substrate for the effector and catalytic
sites.

The amino acids that display significant inhibition of
enzymatic activity are l-cysteine, d-serine, l-histidine, and glycine. Strikingly, l-alanine was
not an effective inhibitor. Double-reciprocal plots of activity varying l-serine at fixed inhibitor concentrations are most consistent
with simple competitive inhibition for l-cysteine and l-histidine with Ki values of 60
μM and 11.4 mM, respectively (Figure 4). The slope replots are linear as are plots of velocity versus inhibitor
concentration, indicating that the velocity goes to zero at an infinite
inhibitor concentration, which is consistent with simple competitive
inhibition (Scheme 2, dashed box). Interestingly, l-cystine does not inhibit the enzyme at 1 mM and only shows
approximately 12% inhibition at 20 mM.

Scheme 2 Figure 4 Inhibition
kinetics of the L. pneumophila dehydratase
with l-cysteine (top) and d-serine (bottom). For
the left panels, the l-serine concentration was varied at
different fixed concentrations of inhibitor and double-reciprocal
plots of velocity vs l-serine concentration are shown: (top
left) 0 (●), 50 (○), 100 (◆), 150 (▲),
200 (▼), and 300 (filled half-square) μM l-cysteine
and (bottom left) 0 (●), 5 (○), 25 (◆), 50 (▲),
100 (▼), and 200 (filled half-square) mM d-serine.
The middle panels shows slope replots of data from the double-reciprocal
plots. The right panels show plots of velocity vs inhibitor concentration
at fixed substrate concentrations: (top right) varying l-cysteine
concentrations with 25 (●), 50 (○), and 100 (◆)
mM l-serine and (bottom right) varying d-serine
concentrations at 2 (●), 10 (○), and 50 (◆) mM l-serine. The y-axes of the double-reciprocal
plots are reciprocal velocity with the velocity measured as the change
in absorbance at 250 nm per minute. Double-reciprocal plots were fit
by linear regression analysis that yielded values for the slopes.
Slope replots and plots of velocity vs inhibitor concentration at
a constant substrate concentration were fit either by linear regression
analysis or in the case of d-serine to a second-degree polynomial.
The values for Ki were estimated graphically
from the x-axis intercept, which equals −Ki. The data points in plots of velocity vs inhibitor
concentration were connected from point to point using the smooth
fit function of Kaleidograph.

The reciprocal plots for d-serine and glycine also
appear
to show competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 7 and 11 mM, respectively. However, the slope replot
for d-serine displays a slight nonlinear character, and the
plot of velocity versus inhibitor concentration shows distinct plateauing
with retention of activity at higher inhibitor concentrations, indicating
only partial inhibition. The plots of velocity versus glycine concentration
(not shown) are not linear but do not show a distinct plateau. This
along with the linear slope replot suggests that glycine inhibition
is predominately competitive. Classically, partial inhibition occurs
when the substrate and inhibitor bind to separate sites on the enzyme
and the IES complex is capable of turning over to yield product (Scheme 2). Previous investigations have provided additional
evidence of two sites, a catalytic site and an effector site. The
enzymatic product, pyruvate, is capable of activating the enzyme at
high concentrations after initial product inhibition at lower concentrations,14 and previous transient kinetic analyses indicate
that there is a second noncatalytic site for l-serine that
is responsible for activation of the enzyme.21 Therefore, the partial inhibition observed here may be more complex
than simple partial competitive inhibition, with the inhibitor and l-serine competing at two distinct sites, the catalytic and
effector sites, rather than mutually exclusive sites. Scheme 2 depicts three scenarios. The central portion, in
the dashed box, depicts simple competitive inhibition. The bottom
portion depicts binding of the inhibitor to an allosteric site, competing
with substrate activation and producing partial inhibition, and the
top portion depicts substrate activation through binding to the allosteric
site. If the concentration of d-serine were to increase,
it would decrease the activation effect of l-serine if it
was not capable of activation itself (in Scheme 2, b &gt; 1 &gt; a). The residual
activity
remaining at a high inhibitor concentration might reflect, at least
partially, the catalytic turnover of the unactivated enzyme.

Mutational
Analysis
Possible Catalytic Residues
The area surrounding the
Fe–S cluster is occupied by a large number of polar side chains
that are absolutely conserved across all four types of l-serine
dehydratases. These include Ser 16, Ser 17, Ser 18, His 19, Ser 53,
Thr 57, His 61, His 124, Asn 126, Ser 147, and Thr 290. In addition,
Thr 63 is invariant in the type 1–3 enzymes and is a serine
residue in members of the type 4 family. These conserved residues
cluster together as shown in Figure 5. Note that His 61 is invariant in the type 1–3
enzymes. In members of the type 4 family that we have examined where
it is missing, the proteins show no catalytic activity. It is possible
that the type 4 family members are pseudoenzymes because bacteria
containing them always appear to express an active l-serine
dehydratase, as well.

Figure 5 Cluster of conserved residues. Within the l-serine
dehydratase
family, there is a cluster of conserved residues located near the
interface of the β and catalytic domains.

Previous mutation of Cys 458 to alanine demonstrated that
there
was little change in the activity of the enzyme (see Table 3).14 Both the Km and kcat increased
slightly, and the kcat/Km decreased slightly. This would indicate that the coordination
of this cysteine residue to the Fe–S cluster is not essential
for activity. In contrast, mutations to Cys 343, Cys 385, and Cys
396 resulted in a complete loss of activity.14 The crystal structure confirms that these latter three cysteines
form the critical structural coordination with the Fe–S cluster.
As noted above, Cys 458 is anchored into the active site by multiple
hydrogen bonds to its carboxylate group (Figure 3b). This hydrogen bonding pattern would still form with the alanine
replacement so that the C-terminal alanine in the mutant enzyme may
be performing the same function. The iron coordination by Cys 458
probably plays a key role in protecting the cluster from oxygen, which
would be consistent with the relative insensitivity of the L. pneumophila enzyme to oxygen exposure.17

measurable activity.

Clearly,
Cys 458 serves as an excellent mimic for the location
of the substrate, l-serine. As indicated in Scheme 1, dehydration of l-serine is assisted by
extraction of the proton from its α carbon by a catalytic base.
Given that there are no potential catalytic bases close enough to
the α carbon of Cys 458 to perform this function in the structure
described here, our current model represents a “precatalytic”
conformation. There are two histidine residues (His 19 and His 61)
within approximately 6 Å of the Cys 458 α carbon, however,
that could possibly move within catalytic distance upon a conformational
rearrangement initiated by serine binding (Figure 6). Mutation of His 61 to alanine results in a complete loss
of catalytic activity. Importantly, the Fe–S cluster is still
intact because the charge transfer absorbance (∼400 nm) is
not diminished (not shown), thus suggesting that His 61 may serve
as the catalytic base. Mutation of His 19 to alanine has an effect
on both Km and kcat. In addition, the mutation has a significant effect on
the Ki for l-cysteine and essentially
no effect on the Ki for d-serine.
Most likely, His 19 is involved in substrate binding because the mutation
mainly affects the interaction with the competitive inhibitor, l-cysteine.

in orange, whereas
the β domain is displayed in green.

Possible Effector Site Residues
Cys 458 is coordinated
to the fourth Fe atom in the cluster, which by analogy to other 4Fe-4S
proteins, such as aconitase, is expected to be the external or catalytic
iron that interacts with the substrate. In addition, it is extensively
hydrogen bonded, largely by residues from the β domain. It is
thus likely that Cys 458 occupies the same position as the substrate
or a position similar to that of the substrate when it binds to the
active site. We hypothesize that activation of the enzyme by l-serine, presumably by binding to an effector site in the β
domain, displaces Cys 458 and opens the active site for catalysis.

The β domain of the L. pneumophila dehydratase
has the same structural fold as the ASB domain of d-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which
binds its substrate allosterically. The two domains superimpose with
a root-mean-square deviation of 2.8 Å for 111 structurally equivalent
α carbons. They differ significantly in two regions. As shown
in Figure 7, the
loops connecting the second and third α helices of the domains
adopt different orientations beginning at Glu 72 in the L.
pneumophila dehydratase. The second difference is the presence
of a β hairpin motif in the β domain of the L.
pneumophila dehydratase, which is lacking in the M. tuberculosis ASB domain.

Figure 7 Comparison of the β domain to the
ASB domain. Structurally,
the β domain of L. pneumophila dehydratase
is similar to the ASB domain of the M. tuberculosisd-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. Shown is a superposition
of the L. pneumophila β domain (purple) onto
the M. tuberculosis ASB domain (light blue). Coordinates
for the M. tuberculosis ASB domain were obtained
from the Protein Data Bank (entry 1YGY).

By analogy to the ASB domain in d-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase, l-serine is thought to bind to the β
domain of l-serine dehydratase as an allosteric ligand. In
this regard, His
124 and Asn 126 may be particularly significant. This HXN (His 124-X-Asn
126) sequence is the same motif that binds l-serine in the
ACT domain of E. colid-phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase (His 344-X-Asn 346). Inspection of the crystal structure
of the L. pneumophila dehydratase shows that His
124 and Asn 126 are, indeed, in the vicinity of the active site with
their side chains both pointing toward the Fe–S cluster (Figure 6). Mutation of His 124 and Asn 126 to alanine (H124A/N126A)
results in a mutant enzyme with a 17-fold higher Km and a kcat approximately
one-third of that of the wild-type enzyme, resulting in a 49-fold
decrease in kcat/Km (Table 3). Since the kcat/Km is essentially a second-order
rate constant for ligand binding at low concentrations, this result
is consistent with these residues potentially being involved with
activation of the enzyme. Moreover, because they do not participate
in extensive hydrogen bonding in this structure, they are poised to
bind a ligand with a minimal energy cost. l-Serine may act
as an effector by binding to these residues. Alternatively, l-serine may allosterically bind in a different location, causing
the C-terminal Cys 458 to be released from the Fe–S cluster
and subsequently to bind to His 124 and Asn 126, which could serve
as a latch to prevent it from interfering with subsequent substrate
binding at the active site. The inhibition constants for l-cysteine and d-serine for the L. pneumophila dehydratase H124A/N126A double mutant are more consistent with the
latter scenario (Table 3). Whereas the Ki for d-serine actually decreases slightly,
that for l-cysteine increases slightly more than 3-fold.
If His 124 and Asn 126 act as a latch to tether the C-terminal cysteine
away from the substrate binding pocket during catalysis, their absence
would likely result in more competition at the active site for the
substrate competitive inhibitor, l-cysteine. Additional data
from cocrystallization and site-directed mutagenesis studies will
be required to further probe the catalytic mechanism of this fascinating
enzyme. These experiments are in progress.

The novel “tail
in mouth” configuration revealed
in this structure, where the C-terminal cysteine residue provides
a unique fourth ligand to the Fe–S cluster, is typically found
in the type 2 l-serine dehydratases. Other types do not usually
contain a terminal cysteine residue, although there are some that
do. This suggests that its mechanism may differ in several key ways
from that of the other types, including how their activity is regulated.
Indeed, it has already been demonstrated that type 1 and 3 l-serine dehydratases require a monovalent cation for activity whereas
the type 2 enzymes do not.18 As far as
we can tell, it appears that each bacterial species expresses only
a single type of active l-serine dehydratase.17 Furthermore, the type 1 enzymes appear to be
found mainly in Gram-positive bacteria, whereas type 2 enzymes are
typically observed in Gram-negative bacteria. Apparently, nature has
produced several different types of Fe–S l-serine
dehydratases to catalyze the same reaction with a species-specific
distribution. This raises the following question: if the four types
are regulated differently, is it because they are matched to some
aspect of the bacterium’s metabolism? This study represents
a significant step toward understanding the functions of these families
of enzymes and the roles that they play in the diverse lifestyles
of bacteria.
