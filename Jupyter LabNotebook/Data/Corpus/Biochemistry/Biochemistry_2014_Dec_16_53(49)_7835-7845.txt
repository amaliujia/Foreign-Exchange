Motor activity of myosin III is regulated
by autophosphorylation.
To investigate the role of the kinase activity on the transporter
function of myosin IIIA (Myo3A), we identified the phosphorylation
sites of kinase domain (KD), which is responsible for the regulation
of kinase activity and thus motor function. Using mass spectrometry,
we identified six phosphorylation sites in the KD, which are highly
conserved among class III myosins and Ste20-related misshapen (Msn)
kinases. Two predominant sites, Thr184 and Thr188, in KD are important for phosphorylation of the KD as well as the
motor domain, which regulates the affinity for actin. In the Caco2
cells, the full-length human Myo3A (hMyo3AFull) markedly enlarged
the microvilli, although it did not show discrete localization within
the microvilli. On the other hand, hMyo3AFull(T184A) and hMyo3AFull(T188A)
both showed clear localization at the microvilli tips. Our results
suggest that Myo3A induces large actin bundle formation to form microvilli,
and phosphorylation of KD at Thr184 and Thr188 is critical for the kinase activity of Myo3A, and regulation of
Myo3A translocation to the tip of microvilli. Retinal extracts potently
dephosphorylate both KD and motor domain without IQ motifs (MDIQo),
which was inhibited by okadaic acid (OA) with nanomolar range and
by tautomycetin (TMC) with micromolar range. The results suggest that
Myo3A phosphatase is protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A). Supporting
this result, recombinant PP2Ac potently dephosphorylates both KD and
MDIQo. We propose that the phosphorylation–dephosphorylation
mechanism plays an essential role in mediating the transport and actin
bundle formation and stability functions of hMyo3A.

Class III myosin, a member of
the myosin superfamily, is unique in having an N-terminal kinase domain
joined to a myosin motor domain.1 Myosin
III is found in the photoreceptor cell of the eye and the stereocilia
of the inner ear hair cells.2,3 In vertebrates, two
isoforms of class III myosin, myosin IIIA (Myo3A) and myosin IIIB
(Myo3B), have been found,4,5 of which most studies
have been done with Myo3A. The human myosin IIIA (hMyo3A) is responsible
for progressive nonsyndromic hearing loss in humans (DFNB30),6 and a mouse model shows age-dependent degeneration
of the stereocillia in inner ear hair cells.7 The physiological function of hMyo3A is still unknown, but recent
studies have suggested that hMyo3A may function as a cargo carrier.8−10

Immunohistochemical studies have shown that Myo3A localizes
at
the tip of stereocillia in inner ear hair cells.3 Fish myosin IIIA (bMyo3A) accumulates in the distal ends
of rod and cone ellipsoid and colocalizes with the plus-distal ends
of inner segment actin filament bundles, where actin forms the microvilli-like
calycal processes.2 Furthermore, GFP–bMyo3A
localizes at the tip of filopodia in Hela cells.11 Since the plus-end of actin filaments of the actin bundles
in filopodia localizes at the tips, the localization of bMyo3A at
the filopodial tips suggests that this myosin traveled on actin filaments
and accumulated at the end of the actin track. Supporting this view,
it was found that hMyo3A has an extremely high affinity for actin
in its dephosphorylated form,12,13 while it has very slow
actin-translocating velocity, which is consistent with low actin-activated
ATPase activity.14,12,15 Recently, it was found that espin 1, which has an activity of actin
filament elongation, binds myosin III, which suggested that myosin
III plays a role in transporting espin 1.16 These findings further supported that myosin III may function as
a cargo transporter.

A critical issue is that autophosphorylation
markedly reduces the
affinity for actin,12,13 suggesting that this is an important
regulatory mechanism for the function of myosin III. Since myosin
III phopshorylates by itself, it is postulated that regulation of
phosphorylation is achieved by protein phosphatases, although the
identity of such protein phosphatases is unknown. It is suggested
that autophosphorylation of the Myo3A motor may act as a means for
its regulation in photoreceptors and inner ear hair cells under specific
cellular conditions.17

Another important
question is the functional significance of myosin
IIIA in actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Myosin IIIA is found in
stereocilia in sensory hair cells, and a myosin IIIA aberration causes
outer hair cell degeneration.7 Moreover,
overexpression of myosin IIIA results in elongation of stereocilia.16 These results suggest the involvement of myosin
IIIA in the structural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton.

In the present study, we identified the phosphorylation sites in
the kinase domain (KD), which are important for the kinase activity
of Myo3A and thus translocation of myosin in cells. We found that
two identified phosphorylation sites are important for the regulation
of hMyo3A localization on actin-bundle based structures of microvilli
in cells. Moreover, we identified that protein phosphatase type 2A
is responsible for dephosphorylation of Myo3A. These findings are
a major step toward understanding the regulation mechanism of hMyo3A
function in vivo. It should be noted that one of our identified sites
(Thr184) was quite recently reported from another group.18 Interestingly, myosin IIIA enlarges the slender
actin bundles produced by espin 1 to thick and long microvilli-like
protrusive structures.

Experimental Procedures
Reagents and Protein
Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was
purified according to Spudich and Watt,19 and actin filaments were stabilized by phalloidin. Restriction enzymes
and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly,
MA). Formic acid, ammonium bicarbonate, urea, dithiothreitol (DTT),
and iodoacetamide (IAA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). Sequencing-grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega
(Madison, WI). HPLC-grade acetonitrile was purchased from Burdick
and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Water was purified using a Milli Q system
(Millipore, Molsheim, France). Smooth muscle myosin RLC (LC20) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified
as described.20,21 PP2Ac and PP1c genes were cloned
into pFast-Bac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Life technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) containing FLAG-tag from rat cDNA. Smooth muscle MLCK was purified
from turkey gizzard as described.22

Generation
of the Human Myosin IIIA Construct
Total
RNA was prepared from human retinal pigment epithelia cell line ARPE-19
(ATCC, Manassas, VA) using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA minikit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Human myosin IIIA (hMyo3A) cDNA was generated
by reverse transcription (Superscript reverse transcriptase II; Life
technologies, Carlsbad, CA) with specific primers.

The amplified
DNA fragments were ligated into pFast-Bac1 baculovirus transfer vector
(Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA), containing FLAG-tag or 6xHis-tag
at the C-terminus, or GST-tag at the N-terminus. Alanine point mutations
were created by site-directed mutagenesis.23 All of the clones were sequence verified. The recombinant baculovirus
expressing hMyo3A derivatives was produced according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.

Expression and Purification of hMyo3A Variants and PPases
To express recombinant hMyo3A and PPases, 200 mL of sf9 cells (about
1 × 109 cells) was infected with each virus expressing
hMyo3A variant. The infected cells were cultured for 3 days at 28
°C. The FLAG-fused recombinant proteins were purified from sf9
cells using 100 μL of anti-FLAG affinity column, and bound proteins
were eluted by FLAG peptide in an elution buffer.24,25 The 6xHis-fused recombinant proteins were purified from sf9 cells
using 100 μL of native Ni-NTA column and eluted with a linear
gradient of 200 to 500 mM imidazole in PBS buffer.12 Baculoviruses expressing GST-fused recombinant proteins
were lysed in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 400 mM NaCl, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
and the supernatant was applied to 100 μL of glutathione–Sepharose
resin (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI). Fusion proteins were eluted
off the GST beads in an elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 10 mM glutathione.26 The purified
proteins were stored at −70 °C after buffer change (PBS
buffer with 10% glycerol). The protein concentration was measured
using the Bradford method, with BSA as the standard.

Gel Electrophoresis
Analysis
SDS-PAGE was carried out
on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gel using the discontinuous buffer
system of Laemmli.27 Molecular mass markers
used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa), galactosidase
(116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum
albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa),
myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and lactalbumin (14.2 kDa).
Gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.

LC-MS/MS Analysis
and Database Search
LC-MS/MS analysis
was performed independently in two laboratories: Yamaguchi University
(Japan) and Korea Basic Science Institute (Korea). In Yamaguchi University,
the protein sample was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF
membrane and stained by CBB to visualize protein. The KD band was
excised and subjected to mass spectrometry. Proteins on the PVDF were
reduced with DTT at 65 °C for 1 h and carboxymethylated with
monoiodoacetic acid. After the PVDF was washed with 2% acetonitrile,
the proteins on the PVDF membrane were digested either with Lys-C
or trypsin at 37 °C for 18 h. The digested peptides were desalted
with ZipTipC18 (Millipore), dried, and redissolved in 2% acetonitrile
and 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were separated by one-dimensional liquid
chromatography (DiNa, KYA technology, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with
reversed phase C18 column. The mobile phases, A and B, consist of
2% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic
acid, respectively. The separated peptides were introduced into a
quadruple-linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometer (4000QTRAP, AB
SCIEX) equipped with Picotip emitter (New Objectives). The MS/MS spectra
of phosphopeptides were acquired either by Prec79(−)-triggered
IDA (information based data acquisition) or MRM (multiple reaction
monitoring)-triggered IDA. The acquired MS/MS spectra were then subjected
to database search using either Mascot (Matrix Sciences) or ProteinPilot
(AB SCIEX) to determine phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation
sites determined in all sample preparations (both Lys-C and trypsin
digestion), all data acquisitions (both Prec79(−)-triggered
IDA and MRM-triggered IDA), and all database search (Mascot and ProteinPilot)
were Ser73, Ser177, Ser178, Thr184, Thr188, and Thr302.

In the
Korea Basic Science Institute, the experiment was done as follows:
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and “in gel digestion”
was performed with trypsin (1:50 proteinase-to-protein) as described.28 In brief, bands were washed and digested by
trypsin at 37 °C for 16 h in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The
peptide samples were dissolved in mobile phase A for Nano-LC/ESI-MS/MS.
Peptides were identified using MS/MS with a nano-LC-MS system consisting
of nanoACQUITY UltraPerformance LC System (Waters Corporation, Milford,
MA) and a LTQ FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, West Palm Beach,
FL) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. An autosampler was used
to load the peptide solutions onto a C18 trap-column (Waters Corporation,
Milford, MA). The peptides were desalted and concentrated, and then
the trapped peptides were separated on a 150 mm homemade microcapillary
C18 column.

The mobile phases, A and B, were composed of 0%
and 100% acetonitrile,
respectively, and each contained 0.1% formic acid. The LC gradients
used are 5% B for 5 min, 15% B for 5 min, 50% B for 70 min, 95% B
for 5 min. We applied 95% B for the next 5 min and 5% B for another
5 min. The voltage for an electrospray was 2.5 kV. In each duty circle
of mass analysis, one high-mass resolution (100 000) MS spectrum
was acquired using the FT-ICR analyzer, followed by five data-dependent
MS/MS scans using the linear ion trap analyzer. For MS/MS analysis,
normalized collision energy (35%) was used throughout the collision-induced
dissociation (CID) phase.

All MS/MS spectral data were manually
analyzed for peptide identification.
Oxidized methionine and carbamidomethylated cysteine (only for reduced
and alkylated protein sample) were considered as a modification. MS/MS
spectra were analyzed with Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4, Thermo
Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL) against the Myosin-IIIa protein database
(Uniprot number Q8NEV4). Proteome Discoverer was used with a monoisotopic
mass selected, a precursor mass error of 25 ppm, and a fragment ion
mass error of 0.8 Da. Full tryptic peptides were selected with two
potential miscleavage. Phosphorylations at serine, threonine, and
tyrosine residues and oxidation at methionine residues were considered
as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylated cysteine was chosen
as a fixed modification. Only peptides with high confidence are included.
All MS/MS spectra identified as modified peptides were manually confirmed.

Kinase Assay
Autophosphorylation of hMyo3A-KD variants
was detected by incorporation of 32P using [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was done in the buffer containing 30
mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1
mM DTT, 1 μM microcystin-LR, 250 μM cold ATP, and 250
μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (1000 Ci/mmol) (GE Healthcare,
Wauwatosa, WI) at 25 °C. The phosphorylated hMyo3A variants were
subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the incorporation of 32P into
phosphorylated kinase domain was detected by phosphorimaging using
the Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI).
Following phosphorimaging, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R-250.

Actin Activated ATPase Assay
The
ATPase activity was
measured in buffer A (30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 μM microcystin-LR, 1 mM ATP)
in the presence of 0.036 μM hMyo3A-MDIQo with or without kinase
domain variants in the presence of an ATP regeneration system (20
units/mL pyruvate kinase and 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate) at 25 °C.29 hMyo3A-MDIQo was preincubated with hMyo3A-KD
variants for 1 h in the absence of actin; then actin-activated ATPase
activity was monitored after addition of actin (10 μM final).
Data fitting and analysis were performed by using GraphPad Prism.

PPase Assay
The hMyo3A-KD, hMyo3A-MDIQo, and LC20 were phosphorylated and used as substrates of PPases. The
autophosphorylation of hMyo3A-KDs was done in the buffer containing
30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA,
1 mM DTT, and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 25
°C. HMyo3A-MDIQo (36 nM) was phosphorylated by 36 nM hMyo3A-KD(WT)
in the buffer containing 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 30 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, and 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 25 °C. LC20 (5 μM) was phosphorylated
by MLCK (5 μg/mL) in the buffer containing 50 μg/mL of
calmodulin (CaM), 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 12.5 mM β-glycerol-phosphate,
25 mM MgC12, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 0.25 mM DTT, and 50
μM [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 25 °C.

The PPase activity was measured in 1 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KCl,
30 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT, 0.5−10 nM PPase, and
2 mM cold-ATP with or without PPase inhibitors for 30 min at 25 °C.
All assays were initiated by adding PPase to the reaction mixture.
The reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the incorporation
of 32P into the protein was measured by phosphorimaging
using the Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa,
WI). Following phosphorimaging, the gel was stained with Coomassie
Brilliant blue R-250. Data fitting and analysis were performed using
GraphPad Prism.

GST-Pull
Down Assay
A 30-μL sample of 50% slurry
of glutathione–Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa,
WI) was equilibrated in PBS buffer (2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Na2HPO4, and KH2PO4).
GST-hMyo3A-KD(D150N) variants (10 μg) were phosphorylated with
1 μg of KD(WT)-flag for 1 h in total volume of 20 μL.
The slurry was mixed with 10 μg of GST-hMyo3A-KD variants and
3 μg of hMyo3A-MDIQo in total volume of 100 μL and then
incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed
three times with 1 mL of the PBS buffer, and then SDS loading buffer
was added to the samples, and the mixture was heated at 100 °C
for 5 min. Proteins were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE and stained by Coomassie
Brilliant blue R-250.

Cell Culture and Transfection
Caco2
cells (ATCC) were
cultured with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were kept in 5%
CO2 at 37 °C. BD-Matrigel (BD biosciences, San Jose,
CA; Catalog No. 356237) was used as a substrate for culturing the
cells. Transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000
(Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacture’s
instructions. Plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen mini- or maxi-prep
columns. The cells were observed at 20 h after transfection. Actin
was stained with Alexa 488-phalloidin.

Cell Fixation
Cells cultured on glass coverslips were
fixed with a fixation buffer (4% formaldehyde, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice
with PBS, and mounted using Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Life technologies,
Carlsbad, CA). For actin staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.05%
Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and stained with
Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

Confocal
Microscopy
Fluorescence images were obtained
with a Leica DM IRB laser scanning confocal microscope controlled
by Leica TCS SP II systems (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany)
equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 60× 1.40 NA oil immersion objective
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The images were processed
using Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).

Results
Identification
of Autophosphorylation Sites in KD of Human Myo3A
We expressed
N-terminal KD using a baculovirus expression system
(Figure 1A). The expressed KD having FLAG-tag
was purified using anti-FLAG affinity chromatography, and KD with
an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa was purified (Figure 1B). We first performed a phosphoamino acid analysis
of autophosphorylated KD and found that threonine residues are predominantly
phosphorylated (Figure 1C). To
identify the phosphorylation sites, we performed a mass spectrometry
analysis. The KD band in the SDS-PAGE gel was excised, digested in
gel, and subjected to a mass spectrometry analysis as described in Experimental Procedures. Mass spectrometry analysis
was done for both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated KD. Six phosphorylation
sites in KD were identified by MS/MS, Ser73, Ser177, Thr178, Thr184, Thr188, and Thr302 (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). The results from the mass spectroscopy analysis for Thr184 and Thr188 are shown in Figure S1B, Supporting Information. Among the identified six phosphorylation
sites, four of the phosphorylated sites were located at the activation
loop (Ser177, Thr178, Thr184, and
Thr188 in hMyo3A-KD).

It is known that the
kinase domain of myosin IIIA (Myo3A) shows
high homology in different species. Among the identified residues,
Ser177, Thr178, Thr184, and Thr188, but not Ser73 and Thr302, are conserved
among various species (Figure S2A, Supporting
Information).

The human Myo3A kinase domain has more
than 41% homology with Msn
kinases belonging to the STE20 kinase family, and Ser177, Thr178, Thr184, and Thr188 are
also conserved among Msn kinases (Figure S1A, Supporting Information). Figure S2B, Supporting
Information, shows sequence alignment of the activation loop
of various STE20 protein kinases. Thr/Ser184 and Thr188 are highly conserved among various kinases of this family,
and it is plausible that phosphorylation at these sites is critical
for the activation of other protein kinases. On the other hand, many
protein kinases in STE20 family have Ser/Thr at position 178 and phosphorylation
at the site might influence the kinase activity in this family.

Autophosphorylation of the Kinase Domain Activates the Protein
Kinase Activity
To see whether autophosphorylation in the
kinase domain regulates the protein kinase activity of Myo3A, we examine
the effect of autophosphorylation on the protein kinase activity using
myelin basic protein (MBP) as a common substrate. The hMyo3A-KD was
first incubated with or without cold ATP; then the phosphorylation
reaction was started by adding [32P]-ATP, and incorporation
of 32P into MBP was monitored. The protein kinase activity
was markedly increased by autophosphorylation (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Note that no 32P incorporation to hMyo3A-KD was detected for the prephosphorylated
hMyo3A-KD, which suggests that the phosphorylation sites were saturated
with phosphorylation with cold ATP during preincubation for 90 min.

Determination of the Predominant Phosphorylation Sites
In
order to investigate the predominant autophosphorylation sites,
we performed site-directed mutagenesis, in which the phosphorylation
sites (Ser73, Ser177, Thr178, Thr184, Thr188, and Thr302) were substituted
for Ala (S73A, S177A, T178A, T184A, T188A, and T302A). The hMyo3A-KD
derivatives were measured for autophosphorylation activity in the
presence of [γ-32P]ATP (at 25 °C for 5 min),
and subjected to phosphoimage analysis.

Phosphoimage analysis
revealed that T178A, T184A, and T188A mutations decreased the autophosphorylation
and MBP phosphorylation activities of hMyo3A-KD (Figure 2A). On the other hand, S73A, S177A, and T302A mutations did
not notably reduce autophosphorylation. These results suggest that
Ser73, Ser177, and Thr302 are not
important for autophosphorylation activity of hMyo3A-KD. Consistently,
T178A, T184A, and T188A mutants showed a marked decrease in the protein
kinase activity against MBP (Figure 2B). These
results suggest that Thr178, Thr184, and Thr188 are important for the kinase activity and autophosphorylation
of hMyo3A-KD. The effect of mutation of these sites on autophosphoryation
was examined in more detail.

hMyo3A-KD mutants (1 μg) were incubated with 0.25 mM [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic protein (MBP) for 5 min at 25 °C.

hMyo3A-KD mutants. Upper, phosphoimages; lower, input amount of hMyo3A-KD

The T178A mutant was autophosphorylated
with prolonged time although
the phosphorylation was significantly slower than that for the wild-type
(WT) (Figure 2B). Both T184A and T188A mutants
failed to be autophosphorylated even with prolonged phosphorylation
time (Figure 2B). These results suggest that
Thr184 and Thr188 are important for the autophosphorylation/protein
kinase activity of Myo3A. These results are consistent with Figure 1C, which shows that predominant autophosphorylation
sites are threonine residues.

It is possible that the purified
hMyo3A-KD is phosphorylated at
certain sites prior to the autophosphorylation reaction. To determine
the major sites phosphorylated during the autophosphorylation reaction,
we prepared hMyo3A-KD(D150N), which has no kinase activity, and examined
the phosphorylation by the wild-type hMyo3A-KD (Figure 3). T184A mutation markedly decreased phosphorylation
of hMyo3A-KD(D150N) by the wild-type hMyo3A-KD. On the other hand,
while T188A mutation reduced wild-type hMyo3A-KD induced phosphorylation,
the effect was not as much as that of T184A mutation. The result suggests
that Thr188 of isolated hMyo3A-KD is phosphorylated to
a certain extent, and Thr184 is the major site phopshorylated
during the phosphorylation reaction.

KD catalyzed by wild
type KD. GST-KD(D150N) having no intrinsic kinase activity was incubated

Phosphorylation of the
Motor Domain of Myosin IIIA by hMyo3A-KD
It has been shown
that the KD phosphorylates the motor domain of
Myo3A.12,13 We purified the motor domain without the
KD (hMyo3A-MDIQo) and studied the effect of mutation of the phosphorylation
sites in the KD on the phosphorylation of the motor domain.

The mutation of Thr184 and Thr188 markedly
diminished the phosphorylation of hMyo3A-MDIQo (Figure 4). It was shown previously that the phosphorylation of the
motor domain inhibits its actin-activated ATPase activity.12,13 Therefore, these results suggest that the phopshorylation of Thr184 and Thr188 is important for the regulation of
the motor activity of Myo3A. To address this issue, we measured the
actin-activated ATPase activity of hMyo3A-MDIQo in the presence of
each hMyo3A-KD derivative. hMyo3A-MDIQo was preincubated with each
hMyo3A-KD derivative for 1 h in the presence of 1 mM ATP, then F-actin
was added to start the actin-activated ATPase reaction. Addition of
the KD(WT) significantly diminished the actin-activated ATPase activity
of hMyo3A-MDIQo, which is thought to be due to phosphorylation of
the motor domain.

variants:

amount of hMyo3A-MDIQo and hMyo3A variants stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue R-250. The reaction was done with 36 nM of hMyo3A-KD
variants, 36 nM of hMyo3A-MDIQo, and 0.25 mM [γ-32P] ATP at 25 °C for 1 h.

The ATPase activities of hMyo3A-MDIQo preincubated with either
hMyo3A-KD(T184A) or hMyo3A-KD(T188A) were similar to that in the absence
of hMyo3A-KD (Figure 5). This
result is consistent with the result that these mutations inhibit
the kinase activities of the KD (Figure 2). On the other hand, KD(T178A) inhibited the ATPase activity
to the same extent as KD(WT) (Figure 5). These results strongly suggest that Thr184 and
Thr188 of the kinase domain are the most important sites
for the kinase activity.

Figure 5 Effect of the mutation at the kinase domain
on the actin activated
ATPase activity of the motor domain of hMyo3. Actin activated ATPase
activity was measured as described in Experimental
Procedures. The ATPase activity of hMyo3A-MDIQo phosphorylated
by each hMyo3A-KD variant is compared with hMyo3A-MDIQo without phosphorylation
by hMyo3A-KD. The relative activities of hMyo3A-MDIQo with each hMyo3A-KD
variant are shown. The actin-activated ATPase activity (100%) is 0.82
± 0.05 s–1. The data shown are the means of
at least three independent experiments.

Binding of the KD to the Motor Domain
To study whether
the KD has a binding activity to the motor domain, we performed motor
domain pull-down assay using GST-KD derivatives. GST-KD was autophopshorylated
prior to the binding assay. The phosphorylated GST-KD did pull-down
the motor domain (hMyo3A-MDIQo), while GST alone failed to pull-down
hMyo3A-MDIQo, suggesting that the KD has a binding activity to the
motor domain (Figure S4, lanes 1 and 2, Supporting
Information). We asked the question whether autophosphorylation
of kinase domain influences the binding to the moror domain. To address
this question, each KD mutant was subjected to the binding assay.
None of the muations including T184A and T188A influenced the binding
of GST-KD to hMyo3A-MDIQo (Figure S4, Supporting
Information). The result suggests that the kinase domain interacts
with the motor domain, which may facilitate the phosphorylation of
the motor domain; however, the phosphorylation of the KD or the kinase
activity of the KD does not influence the interaction between the
KD and the motor domain.

The Kinase Activity Influences the Translocation
of Full-length
hMyo3A to the Tip of Microvilli
It has been found that Myo3A
localizes at the tip of stereocilia in inner ear hair cells and the
plus ends of actin filament bundles of the microvilli-like calycal
processes.2,3 Therefore, we studied the role of phosphorylation
at critical sites in the KD on translocation of Myo3A in microvilli,
an actin bundle structure similar to stereocilia. When Caco2 cells
were transfected with espin 1, thin and short microvilli-like protrusions
were produced from the apical surface of the cells (Figure 6A). Coexpression of full-length human myosin IIIA
(hMyo3A(WT)) induced much longer and thicker microvilli-like apical
protrusions (Figure 6B). It was previously
reported that Myo3A elongates the length of filopodia induced by espin
1 in Cos7 cells,16 and the present result
is consistent with the earlier report. Moreover, our result suggests
that Myo3A ties-up the actin bundles produced by espin 1 to make thick
and long microvilli-like protrusive structures. Espin 1 localizes
throughout the microvilli, and hMyo3A(WT) well colocalized with espin
1 throughout the microvilli but did not show discrete localization
within the microvilli (Figure 6B). On the other
hand, hMyo3A(D150N), a kinase dead variant of full-length myosin IIIA,
showed discrete localization at the tips of microvilli (Figure 6C). This suggests that the kinase activity, and
thus autophosphorylation, attenuates the microvilli tip localization
of Myo3A. On the other hand, elimination of the kinase activity did
not change the distribution of espin 1 in the microvilli. The result
suggests that the majority of Myo3A may not efficiently transport
espin 1 or transported espin 1 is immediately pushed back together
with actin because of fast actin treadmill. We then asked a question
of which residues in the KD are critical for the translocation of
Myo3A in microvilli. To address this question, we coexpressed GFP–full
length hMyo3A(T184A) and hMyo3A(T188A) with espin 1 in Caco2 cell
(Figure 6D,E). GFP–full length hMyo3A(T184A)
and hMyo3A(T188A) showed significant accumulation at the tip of microvilli
(Figure 6D,E). It should be noted that these
mutant Myo3A did not alter the localization of espin 1 in microvilli.
These results suggest that autophosphorylation at Thr184 and Thr188 is critical for the translocation of Myo3A
in cells. These results are consistent with the role of these sites
on autophosphorylation of the KD, in which Thr184 and Thr188 are critical for autophosphorylation.

Identification of hMyo3A
Specific PPase
Since the extent
of phosphorylation of Myo3A is controlled by the relative rate of
autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase (PPase),
we attempted to identify the protein phosphatases responsible for
the dephosphorylation of Myo3A. To identify hMyo3A specific PPase,
we examined the dephosphorylation of hMyo3A-KD using retina tissue
extracts with or without PPase inhibitors, okadaic acid (OA) and tautomycetin
(TMC), which distinguish the different types of PPases (Figure 7A,B).

Figure 7 Identification of hMyo3A-KD specific PPase from
pig retina. (A)
Phosphorylated hMyo3A-KD (P-KD, 36 nM) was incubated with tissue extracts
(pig retina and ear bone) for 30 min. (lane 1) P-KD alone; (lane 2)

mean ± SEM from three independent sets of experiments. The radioactive
band was excised and subjected to Cerenkov counting. The value of
untreated was set as 100%. IC50 of OA and TMA was 2 nM
and 93 nM, respectively.

The hMyo3A-KD specific PPase activity
was significantly inhibited
by a low concentration (IC50 = 2 nM) of OA, whereas the
inhibition required high concentration (IC50 = 93 nM) of
TMC (Figure 7A,B). This result suggests that
the hMyo3A-KD specific PPase is type 2A PPase. To confirm this, we
made recombinant phosphatase type 1 catalytic domain (PP1c) and phosphatase
type 2A catalytic domain (PP2Ac) and measured the dephosphorylation
of phosphorylated hMyo3A-KD (Figure 8). The
recombinant PP2Ac markedly dephosphorylated hMyo3A-KD, whereas PP1c
showed low activity in dephosphorylation of hMyo3A-KD (Figure 8A), although both recombinant PPases showed similar
dephosphorylation activity for LC20 (Figure 8B). Figure 8C–E shows the inhibition
of PP2Ac for dephosphorylation of hMyo3A-KD. The concentration dependence
of the inhibition by OA and TMC is nearly identical to that of Myo3A
phosphatase in retina extract (see Figure 7). This result further supports that PPase type 2A is responsible
for dephosphorylation of hMyo3A.

Since phosphorylation in the motor domain regulates the affinity
of hMyo3A to actin, we examined dephosphorylation of the hMyo3A-MDIQo
by retina extract, PP1c, and PP2Ac (Figure S5, Supporting Information). hMyo3A-MDIQo was first phosphorylated
by hMyo3A-KD and then subjected to dephosphorylation in the presence
of retina extract, PP1c, and PP2Ac. The hMyo3A-MDIQo was dephosphorylated
by retina extract or PP2Ac, whereas PP1c did not effectively dephosphorylate
the motor domain. Interestingly, both PP1c and PP2Ac showed higher
dephosphorylation activity for the kinase domain than for the motor
domain.

Discussion
Six phosphorylation sites
in the KD of human Myo3A are identified
by mass spectrometry analysis in the present study. Four out of six
identified phosphorylation sites in KD were located at the activation
loop (Ser177, Thr178, Thr184, and
Thr188). All four residues are conserved among myosin IIIs
from various species, and all but Ser177 are also conserved
among Msn kinases belonging to the STE20 kinase family. The result
suggests that these protein kinases are also autophosphorylated at
these residues, which regulate the kinase activity.

Two phosphorylation
sites, Ser177 and Thr184 in mouse Myo3A, were
previously reported.30 While this study
was underway, Ser177, Thr178, and Thr184 were reported as phosphorylation sites in
the KD of hMyo3A.18 These sites are also
identified in hMyo3A in this study. Thr184 of hMyo3A site
was identified as a major autophosphorylation site, but Ser177 and Thr178 were not major sites, and S177A and T178A
mutation did not affect the autophosphorylation of the KD. Furthermore,
we newly identified an additional predominant site (Thr188) in hMyo3A-KD, which is located in the activation loop of the kinase
domain. Among these sites, T184A and T188A mutation notably diminished
the kinase activity, suggesting that the phosphorylation of these
sites activates the kinase. T184A and T188A mutation almost completely
inhibited the autophosphorylation activity.

It is known that
phosphorylation in the activation loop activates
various protein kinases.31 For instance,
PKA32 and PKC33 are phosphorylated at Thr197 and Thr500 [PKC
βII34], respectively, corresponding
to Thr184 of hMyo3A, in the activation loop catalyzed by
PDK1,35 which causes marked activation
of the kinase activity. Our result suggests that Thr184 is one of the major sites of autophosphorylation, and the phosphorylation
at this site notably enhances the kinase activity. While other protein
kinases such as PDK1 might also phosphorylate this site for activation,
based upon our present result, it is likely that Myo3A is autophosphorylated
in cells. Threonine at this site is replaced by other residues in
several STE20 families (Figure S2B, Supporting
Information).

We also found that Thr188 is
phosphorylated and T188A
mutation markedly diminishes the kinase activity. This residue is
pretty well conserved among Ser/Thr kinases with some exceptions,
but this residue is replaced by proline for tyrosine kinases.36 In some kinases in STE20 family, the threonine
residue at this position is replaced by valine or cysteine (Figure
S2B, Supporting Information).

When
this site of the inactive KD is mutated to alanine, notable 32P incorporation is achieved by active KD, which suggests
that a significant fraction of Thr188 is phosphorylated
before the 32P incorporation reaction. Alternatively, prior
phosphorylation of Thr184 is required for the phosphorylation
of Thr188.

Taken together, it is thought that the
phosphorylation of Thr188 is critical for the activation
of the kinase activity and
the phosphorylation at this site may not be readily dephosphorylated
by protein phosphatases. It was reported previously for PKA that T201A
mutation (corresponding to Thr188 of hMyo3A) reduced the
protein kinase activity. It was suggested that the −OH moiety
of Thr201 is within hydrogen bonding distance from Lys168, which has an important role in the transfer of γ-phosphate
of ATP.37 Since several Ser/Thr kinases
have valine and cysteine, and tyrosine kinases have proline in this
position, it is not clear whether the threonine residue at this position
hydrogen bonds with lysine in the catalytic lobe. However, we cannot
exclude a possibility that T188A mutation inactivates the activity
due to disruption of hydrogen bonding.

On the other hand, incorporation
of 32P was markedly
reduced for T184A mutation, suggesting that the Thr184 site
is easily available for autophosphorylation and is susceptible to
dephosphorylation reaction. Since Myo3A autophosphorylates this site,
it is plausible that this site is phosphorylated in cells in basal
conditions and the dephosphorylation can be achieved upon the activation
of the responsible protein phosphatases.

An important question
is the identity of such protein phosphatases.
Present results demonstrated that protein phosphatase type 2A is responsible
for the dephopshorylation of Myo3A for both the kinase domain and
the motor domain. When Caco2 cells were transfected with the wild-type
Myo3A, it did not localize at the tip of microvilli. This suggests
that Myo3A is in the phosphorylated form, since the unphosphorylatable
constructs showed the tip localization (Figure 6). It is plausible that PP2A needs to be activated for translocation
of hMyo3A to the tip of microvilli.

Previous studies showed
that full length Myo3A and espin 1 colocalize
at filopodia in Cos7 cells without discrete localization.16 However, the elimination of the kinase domain
of Myo3A induced accumulation of espin 1 and full length Myo3A at
filopodial tips.16 Since phosphorylation
of the motor domain of Myo3A markedly changes the affinity for actin,12,13 it is thought that dephosphorylation of Myo3A facilitates the translocation
of Myo3A due to the increase in the affinity for actin, and it transports
espin 1 to filopodial tips. However, Myo3A and espin 1 are found in
stereocilia, a microvilli-like structure, in vivo.16 Moreover, it was found that single nucleotide polymorphisms
of the Myo3A gene are linked with an increase in
risk for colon cancer.38 Therefore, we
used microvilli of a colon cancer cell line (Caco2) as a model to
investigate the function of Myo3A in vivo.

We found that espin
1 induced thin and short protrusions in Caco2
cells. The result is consistent with the finding in a kidney epithelial
cell line, LLC-PK1-CL4, in which overexpression of espin 1 induced
actin bundles to form apical protrusions.39 Interestingly, we found that coexpression of Myo3A with espin 1
induced much thicker and longer microvilli-like apical protrusions,
and Myo3A and espin 1 colocalized throughout the body of microvilli.
This result is consistent with the finding that Myo3A binds to espin
1.16 Furthermore, our result suggests that
Myo3A influences the function of espin 1 to facilitate actin bundles.
In contrast to the observation of Myo3A/espin 1 in filopodia, Myo3A
does not alter the localization of espin 1 in microvilli, and espin
1 localized throughout the microvilli, although the kinase dead Myo3A
was localized at the tip of microvilli. These results suggest that
Myo3A does not transport espin 1, although it can bind to espin 1.
It was shown previously that the Myo3A binding domain (ankyrin repeats
domain) of espin 1 without the actin binding site translocates to
filopodial tips along with Myo3A.16 Together
with the present results, it is thought that espin 1 can move together
with Myo3A if the actin binding activity is eliminated, but espin
1 having the actin binding activity associates with large actin bundles
in microvilli. It is plausible that espin 1 ends up showing colocalization
with Myo3A due to its binding affinity to Myo3A. The present finding
supports this notion, and it is likely that the distribution of espin
1 is dependent on the affinity with actin and Myo3A. Based upon these
findings, we propose the following model: Myo3A and espin 1 form a
complex composed of multiple Myo3A/espin 1 molecules. This complex
binds to a number of actin filaments to produce large actin bundles,
thus creating a thick microvilli structure.

Myo3A is recruited
to the espin 1 induced original apical thin
protrusion through the binding to espin 1 presumably by diffusion,
and once it forms a complex with espin 1, it facilitates production
of large actin bundles because the complex containing multiple espin
1 molecules can converge multiple actin filaments.

We also found
that the length of microvilli is notably increased
with Myo3A coexpression. It is postulated that tight actin bundles
containing a large number of actin filaments at the tip of the protrusion
increases the density of plus ends of actin filaments. It is anticipated
that this changes the equilibrium of polymerization and depolymerization
of actin at the plus end toward polymerization, thus elongating microvilli,
although we cannot exclude a possible function of other factors in
elongation process of microvilli.
