Factor
inhibiting HIF (FIH) is a cellular O2-sensing enzyme, which
hydroxylates the hypoxia inducible factor-1α. Previously reported
inverse solvent kinetic isotope effects indicated that FIH limits
its overall turnover through an O2 activation step (Hangasky J. A. , Saban E. ,
and Knapp M. J.   (2013 ) Biochemistry 52 , 1594 −1602 23351038 ). Here we characterize the rate-limiting step for O2 activation by FIH using a suite of mechanistic probes on
the second order rate constant kcat/KM(O2). Steady-state kinetics showed
that the rate constant for O2 activation was slow (kcat/KM(O2)app = 3500 M–1 s–1) compared with other non-heme iron oxygenases,
and solvent viscosity assays further excluded diffusional encounter
with O2 from being rate limiting on kcat/KM(O2). Competitive
oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effect measurements (18kcat/KM(O2) = 1.0114(5)) indicated that the transition state for O2 activation resembled a cyclic peroxohemiketal, which precedes the
formation of the ferryl intermediate observed in related enzymes.
We interpret this data to indicate that FIH limits its overall activity
at the point of the nucleophilic attack of Fe-bound O2— on the C-2 carbon of αKG. Overall, these results
show that FIH follows the consensus mechanism for αKG oxygenases,
suggesting that FIH may be an ideal enzyme to directly access steps
involved in O2 activation among the broad family of αKG
oxygenases.

Mammalian
cells respond to decreased
cellular pO2 levels through the enzyme-catalyzed reaction
of O2 with the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α
or HIF).1 HIF mediates the transcription
of hundreds of genes in response to hypoxia2 with the functions of the gene products ranging from glucose and
iron metabolism to cell proliferation and angiogenesis.3,4 Factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) is a non-heme Fe(II)/αKG oxygenase
that turns-off the transcriptional activity of HIF5,6 by
hydroxylating the β-carbon of Asn803 within the C-terminal
activation domain (CTAD) of HIF (Scheme 1).7−9 Because O2 activation chemistry is central to hypoxia
sensing by HIF, identifying the chemical steps involved in O2 activation may point the way to methods for perturbing HIF-controlled
gene expression.

Scheme 1 Consensus Chemical Mechanism of αKG Oxygenases,
Adapted for FIH
FIH is proposed to
follow the consensus mechanism for Fe(II)/αKG oxygenases (Scheme 1) for which the steps are supported to varying degrees
by spectroscopic, computational, and kinetic studies.10−15 VTVH MCD methodologies have been used to spectroscopically identify
the release of the aquo ligand upon substrate binding to FIH16 and other Fe(II)/αKG oxygenases including
TauD and CAS.17,18 O2 is thought to bind
as a ferric superoxide at the open coordination site and then attacks
the C-2 carbonyl of αKG to ultimately form succinate and a ferryl
intermediate. The molecular details following O2 activation,
including isolation of the ferryl intermediate and observation of
HAT have been characterized in the Fe(II)/αKG oxygenases TauD15,19−24 and P4H25 and the related Fe(II)/αKG
halogenases CytC326 and SyrB2.27

In contrast to the steps following ferryl
formation, those steps of O2 activation are poorly understood.
Computational studies suggest that nucleophilic attack on the C-2
carbonyl of αKG is the rate-limiting step on kcat/KM(O2), with
a cyclic peroxohemiketal proposed as the transition state.28−30 Although this reaction sequence is supported by pre-steady-state
kinetics and an oxygen-18 kinetic isotope effect (18O KIE)
study of TauD,31 insight into O2 activation is limited because HAT or product release is rate-limiting
in TauD and other well-characterized αKG oxygenases.20,32,33 Consequently, O2 activation
is too rapid to allow for the identification of any intermediates
prior to the ferryl.

Recent studies showed that the rate-limiting
step for FIH differed from that of other characterized αKG oxygenases.16,34 Upon FIH binding to CTAD, there is partial retention of the aquo
ligand16 suggesting that aquo release may
be less facile in FIH than in other enzymes. The inverse SKIE on kcat(34) for FIH indicates
that the aquo release reaches equilibrium prior to an irreversible
step that is the overall rate-limiting step in FIH; in other words,
the overall rate limiting step either precedes or coincides with the
formation of the ferryl. This suggests that FIH either deviates from
the consensus chemical mechanism or could provide a unique system
to access other steps of mechanistic interest. In this work, we probe kcat/KM(O2), which focuses on the limited subset of steps that are involved
in binding and reacting with O2, to understand O2 activation by FIH. Steady-state kinetics under conditions of varied
solvent viscosity indicated that diffusional encounter of O2 with FIH was not rate limiting on kcat/KM(O2). Furthermore, we determined
the 18O KIE on kcat/KM(O2) (18kcat/KM(O2) = 1.0114(5)),
identifying the rate-limiting step as formation of the peroxohemiketal.
This showed that the chemical steps of O2 activation on
FIH followed the consensus mechanism, indicating that FIH only differs
from other αKG oxygenases in that this O2 activation
step is the overall rate-limiting step during turnover.34

Materials and Methods
Materials
All
reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received
unless noted. The sequences of the synthetic 19- and 39-mer CTAD peptides
corresponded to the C-terminal activation domain (CTAD) of HIF-1α788–806 and HIF-1α788–826, respectively,
with a Cys800 → Ala point mutation. Peptides were
purchased from EZBiolab (Carmel, Indiana, USA) with free N- and C-termini.
The CTAD788–806 peptide (purity &gt;95%) was used
without further purification; however CTAD788–826 was purchased as a desalted peptide and purified to &gt;95% purity
using RP-HPLC as previously described.34

Protein Expression and Purification
FIH was overexpressed
in Escherichia coli and purified as previously reported.34,35 Thrombin cleavage of the His6 tag led to three additional
residues preceding the native sequence of FIH on the N-terminus (NH2-Gly-Ser-His-). The purity of the protein (&gt;95%) was assessed
through SDS-PAGE.

Steady-State Kinetic Assays with Varying
O2
All assays were performed in an AtmosBag (Sigma-Aldrich)
with the O2 concentration of the reaction buffers equilibrated
to the O2 partial pressue within the bag. The atmosphere
of the bag was equilibrated for 30 min with a controlled mixture of
N2 and O2. HEPES, pH 7.00 (50 mM) was gently
stirred for 5 min in a 37.0 °C water bath to equilibrate the
reaction buffer with the atmosphere, and then the O2 concentration
was measured using a Clarke electrode.

Steady-state assays in
which O2 was the varied substrate (0.020–1 mM) utilized
a fixed CTAD788–826 concentration of either 80 μM
(∼KM(CTAD)) or 150 μM (∼2KM(CTAD)) and saturating concentrations of FeSO4 (25 μM), αKG (100 μM), and ascorbate (2
mM), prepared in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00. Upon addition of all reagents
except FIH, the reaction mixture (45 μL) was incubated at 37.0
°C for an additional 2 min. The enzyme stock was equilibrated
to the atmosphere by gently pipetting the solution down the side of
the microcentrifuge tube, before injecting an aliquot (5 μL)
to initiate the assays. Reaction aliquots were removed throughout
a 3 min time course, quenched in 75% acetonitrile/0.2% TFA (20 μL)
saturated with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and analyzed for
the initial rate of formation of CTADOH using a Bruker
microFlex MALDI-TOF-MS. Initial rates were determined as previously
described34 and fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation resulting in the apparent kinetic parameters kcat, kcat/KM(O2), and KM(O2).

Solvent Viscosity Effect
Assays to test for rate-limiting
diffusional encounter of O2 utilized a fixed CTAD788–826 concentration of 80 μM (∼KM(CTAD)) and saturating concentrations of FeSO4 (25 μM),
αKG (100 μM), and ascorbate (2 mM), with the exception
of the addition of sucrose (25% w/w) to the 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00,
to give a relative visocisty of η/η0 = 2.4.36 Reactions were performed as described above
to determine initial rates with O2 as the varied substrate,
which were then fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation.

Steady-State
Kinetic Assays with CTAD788–806
Assays
in which CTAD788–806 was varied (0.10–4.6
mM) were performed at 37.0 °C in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00, and contained
ascorbate (2 mM), αKG (1 mM), FeSO4 (50 μM),
and an ambient O2 concentration (217 μM). Assays
in which αKG was varied (0.005–1 mM) were also performed
at 37.0 °C in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00, and contained ascorbic acid
(2 mM), FeSO4 (50 μM), and CTAD788–806 (750 μM), with an ambient O2 concentration (217
μM). Reagents were mixed and incubated at 37.0 °C for 2
min before initiating turnover with enzyme (5–20 μM).
At predetermined time points, aliquots were quenched in 75% acetonitrile/0.2%
TFA (20 μL) saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid.
Initial rates were detemined as described above and fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation resulting in the apparent kinetic parameters kcat, kcat/KM, and KM.

18O KIE Sample Preparation and Analysis
Assays used to determine
the 18O KIE contained αKG (1.0 mM), CTAD788–806 (250 μM), FeSO4 (50 μM), and O2 (280 μM) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00. Buffer was equilibrated
to ambient O2 concentration (280 μM) by gently stirring
for 2 days at 21 °C. All reagents were prepared freshly using
the equilibrated buffer and gently mixed to make a common reaction
mixture. This reaction mixture was injected into a 10 mL crimp vial
sealed with a butyl rubber stopper (Geo-Microbial Technologies, Inc.;
Ochelata, OK), ensuring all air was removed. After a 3 min incubation
of the vial at 37.0 °C, each reaction was initiated with an injection
(20 μL) of a high concentration FIH stock that had been equilibrated
to room temperature (21 °C). Reactions were quenched using 6
M HCl, 3.5 M ZnCl2 (40 μL) after an extended reaction
time such that the fractional conversion based on O2 was
as high as 35%. An aliquot (5 μL) was removed to determine the
reaction progress by measuring CTADOH formation using a
Bruker MALDI-TOF-MS. The quantity of CTADOH produced was
used to determine the fractional conversion of O2 for each
quenched reaction. The sealed crimp vials containing the quenched
reactions were stored inverted and submerged in water until analysis
by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).

The 18O KIE samples were carefully transferred into pre-evacuated 25 mL
glass vessels fitted with a glass high vacuum stopcock (Chemglass).
The filling procedure is described in detail by Emerson et al.37 but briefly consisted of flushing the neck of
the bottle with a gentle stream of CO2 to displace air
followed by introduction of sample water from a small diameter tubing
(∼3 mm) to the bottleneck. Upon opening the stopcock slowly,
sample water is drawn into the evacuated bottle until the bottle is
approximately half full. The headspace gases and water are then equilibrated
by gently shaking in a 25 °C water bath overnight. Before IRMS
analysis, the sample water was removed using aspiration, leaving ∼0.5
mL of sample in the bottle. Headspace gases in the bottle were then
analyzed for the δ18O of O2 using a gas
chromatograph interfaced to an Elementar Isoprime IRMS.38 All δ18O isotopic values were
reported using standard delta notation relative to the Vienna standard
mean ocean water (VSMOW).39 Equation 1 was used to convert the δ18O to
an R value (18O/16O isotopic
ratio), where Rstd is the standard isotopic
value for O2 in air (0.0020531)40 and Rf is the 18O/16O isotopic ratio at O2 fractional conversion f. 1  To determine the 18O/16O isotopic ratio at t = 0 (R0), a sample was prepared from the common reaction
stock containing αKG (1.0 mM), CTAD788–806 (250 μM), FeSO4 (50 μM), and O2 (280 μM) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00, and injected into a sealed
crimp vial. After incubation for 3 min at 37.0 °C, an aliquot
of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00 (20 μL), was injected into the vial
immediately followed by an injection (40 μL) of 6 M HCl, 3.5
M ZnCl2 to quench the reaction.

The 18O KIE was determined by fitting Rf/R0 vs f to eq 2, where f is the fractional conversion of
O2 in the reaction aliquot, Rfis the 18O/16O isotope ratio
of the aliquot, and R0 is the 18O/16O isotope ratio of the blank. 2  

Results and Discussion
The O2 activation mechanisms of Fe(II)/αKG oxygenases
are of enormous interest due to the biomedical significance of these
enzymes.12,41,42 FIH hydroxylates
the HIF transcription factor for hypoxia sensing, and other members
are involved in processes such as DNA and RNA repair and histone demethylation,12,43,44 placing some of these enzymes
into biological roles that are more concerned with regulation than
with bulk turnover of metabolites. A crucial mechanistic feature of
these enzymes is O2 activation to form an active oxidant,
identified in several enzymes as a ferryl species.19,25,26 Despite the importance of the chemical steps
leading up to formation of the ferryl, these steps remain largely
uncharacterized. Because the overall rate-limiting step for FIH either
precedes or coincides with ferryl formation,34 FIH could be an excellent enzyme to interrogate steps involved in
O2 activation that are common to other αKG oxygenases,
provided that FIH follows the consensus mechanism.

Steady-State Kinetics with
Varying O2
To characterize the steps limiting
the rate of O2 activation by FIH, steady-state kinetic
assays with O2 as the varied substrate were performed using
a fixed CTAD788–826 concentration. Because our assays
used subsaturating CTAD concentration due to reagent expenses, these
steady-state assays used two different CTAD788–826 concentrations to measure the second order rate constant, kcat/KM(O2).

Figure 1 Steady-state kinetics with varying O2. Reactions contained
FIH (0.25–0.5 μM), ascorbate (2 mM), αKG (100 μM),
FeSO4 (25 μM), and CTAD788–826 (80
μM,●, or 150 μM, ■) in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.00,
37.0 °C.

The initial rate data
using 80 μM CTAD788–826 was fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation with kinetic parameters of kcatapp = 33 ±
3 min–1 and kcat/KM(O2)app = 0.17 ± 0.03 μM–1 min–1 (Figure 1, Table 1). The steady-state assays with varying O2 using an increased CTAD concentration (150 μM) resulted in kcat/KM(O2)app = 0.21 ± 0.04,
which is statistically equivalent to the kcat/KM(O2)app at 80 μM CTAD788–826. These results indicated that kcat/KM(O2) was independent of CTAD concentration
as expected for the sequential consensus mechanism (Scheme 1). The high value for the Michaelis constant (KM(O2)app &gt; 200 μM) was in agreement with
previous reported values (90–237 μM) obtained using oxygen
consumption assays and 14CO2 capture assays45,46 and is thought to be essential for a proportionate sensory response
by FIH to increasing pO2.

When converted into standard
units, kcat/KM(O2)app = 3.5 × 103 M–1 s–1, it was clear that the rate constant for O2 activation
in FIH was significantly slower than those for non-heme iron oxygenases
that are not involved in O2 concentration sensing, such
as TauD (1.5 × 105 M–1 s–1),33,47 tyrosine hydroxylase (6.0 × 104 M–1 s–1),48 and lipoxygenase (∼5.0 × 105 M–1 s–1).49,50 In contrast, the slow rate constant for O2 activation
and the high Michaelis constant for O2 found for FIH are
found in those non-heme iron oxygenases implicated in O2 sensing, such as PHD251 and Jumonji C
domain-containing histone demethylases.52 The small magnitude of kcat/KM(O2) for FIH is intriguing, raising
the potential for FIH and these putative O2 sensors to
use an unusual strategy for O2 activation. Although it
is likely that a slow chemical step limits kcat/KM(O2) and O2 activation, it was necessary to test diffusional encounter
as a possibility for the rate-limiting step.

Solvent Viscosity Effect
To test for diffusional encounter with O2 as a partially
rate-limiting step on kcat/KM(O2), we performed steady-state assays under
varied solvent viscosity. Although kcat/KM(O2) is orders of magnitude
slower than expected for a diffusional process (ca. 1 × 109 M–1 s–1), we could not
dismiss the possibility that there was an unfavorable pre-equilibrium
leading to a very small fraction of FIH being competent for reaction
upon collision. For diffusion controlled processes, kcat/KM(O2) would
decrease in the presence of added viscosogen due to a lower diffusion
rate as observed for other enzymes such as superoxide dismutase53,54 and carbonic anhydrase.55,56

Our assays were
performed as described above in the presence and absence of the viscosgen
sucrose, giving a final relative viscosity (η/ηo) of 1.0 and 2.4, respectively (Figure 2).
At increased solvent viscosity, the resulting kinetic parameter kcat/KM(O2)app = 0.18 ± 0.04 μM–1 min–1 was indistinguishable from
the kinetic parameter collected in the absence of viscosogen (Table 2). The resulting insignificant solvent viscosity
effect on kcat/KM(O2) indicated that diffusional encounter with
O2 did not limit the rate constant for O2 activation
in FIH.

Diffusion limited rate constants may be found with
enzymes that have achieved catalytic perfection, reflecting a physiological
role that requires bulk turnover of a large quantity of substrate.
For example, diffusion limited rate constants fit well for SOD’s
cellular function to scavenge superoxide to minimize oxidative damage.57 As an O2 sensor, one would imagine
that FIH turnover could be limited by collisional encounter. However,
the absence of a viscosity effect on kcat/KM(O2) and kcat showed that FIH was not diffusionally limited under
varied O2 concentration. This implicates a chemical step
as rate-limiting under conditions of low O2 concentration,
consistent with prior results indicating that kcat was limited by a step that followed aquo release but preceded
the HAT.34

Competitive 18O Kinetic Isotope Effect
Because kcat/KM(O2) encompasses
all steps between diffusional collision of FIH with O2 through
the subsequent irreversible step, the 18O heavy atom isotope
effect on this rate constant is an ideal reporter of the rate-limiting
step. We employed competitive 18O/16O KIE measurements
using O2 at natural isotopic abundance to identify the
rate limiting step on kcat/KM(O2) in FIH. The 18O/16O isotopic abundance of residual O2 was measured by IRMS
from quenched reactions of FIH, which were fit to eq 2 resulting in a 18kcat/KM(O2) = 1.0114(5) (Figure 3). Because the typical range of values for 18kcat/KM(O2) is 1.00–1.03, this places O2 activation
by FIH in a clear context when considered next to the mechanisms followed
by other non-heme Fe enzymes.31

Figure 3 18O fractionation (Rf/R0) versus the fractional conversion of O2 in
quenched reactions of FIH. Each reaction contained αKG (1.0
mM), CTAD788–806 (250 μM), FeSO4 (50 μM), and O2 (280 μM) in 50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.00, 37.0 °C. Data are fit to eq 2; 18kcat/KM(O2) = 1.0114(5).

18kcat/KM(O2) reflects the changes in O–O bonding
between molecular O2 and the transition state of the kinetically
irreversible step on kcat/KM(O2).58,59 Because the 18O equilibrium isotope effect (18O EIE) provides an upper
limit for the 18O KIE,60 previously
calculated 18O EIEs for the equilibrium Fe2+ + O2 ⇔ X provide an excellent yardstick for the
transition state structure based upon the value of 18kcat/KM(O2) (Chart 1).31 For
example, the calculated 18O EIE for X = Fe3+(O2–) is small (18O EIE =
1.0080),31 meaning that rate-limiting formation
of this intermediate would lead to a correspondingly small value for 18kcat/KM(O2). A larger 18O EIE is calculated for X =
ferric peroxo-carbonate (18O EIE =1.0129),31 a structure resembling the putative peroxohemiketal, which
is in good agreement with the observed 18kcat/KM(O2) for
FIH, suggesting that the rate-limiting step for FIH proceeds through
a transition state that resembles this structure. In contrast, the
observed 18kcat/KM(O2) is inconsistent with the 18O EIE calculated for X = ferryl (18O EIE = 1.0287),31 indicating that the ferryl intermediate is formed
after the rate-limiting step on kcat/KM(O2) in FIH.

Chart 1 Proposed Transition
State Structures from 18O EIEa
a 18O EIE values were calculated in ref (31).



18kcat/KM(O2) has been utilized to study the O2 activation pathways of other non-heme iron enzymes including soluble
methane monooxygenase,61 ACCO,62 TauD,31 HppE,31 and tyrosine hydroxylase.63 In each case, the magnitude of 18kcat/KM(O2) provided
important insight into the chemical strategy followed for O2 activation. For those enzymes in which O2 binds at Fe2+, the initial step is the reversible formation of a Fe3+(O2–) adduct, which subsequently
requires electrons from cofactor or (co)substrate to activate the
O–O bond for chemistry. In the case of TauD, this activation
takes the form of a nucleophilic attack of the Fe3+(O2–) on the C-2 keto position of αKG.31

The 18kcat/KM(O2) for FIH (1.0114(5))
is very similar to that observed for TauD (18kcat/KM(O2) = 1.0102),31 indicating a common transition state structure
for αKG decarboxylation in these two enzymes. The larger value
for the 18kcat/KM(O2) for FIH than for TauD is likely due to
the slower turnover rate of FIH. The observed 18kcat/KM(O2) will approach the 18O EIE when the forward commitment,
which is the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants for disappearance
of the species immediately preceding the rate-limiting step, is small
as might be expected for the slower chemistry in FIH.

Scheme 2 O2 Activation in αKG Oxygenases
The chemical strategy for O2 activation in
αKG oxygenases was predicted by DFT calculations to proceed
through the nucleophilic attack on the αKG cofactor28,29 and is supported by the 18O KIE results. The self-consistent
field (SCF) calculations predicted that decomposition of the initially
formed cyclic peroxohemiketal intermediate was barrierless29 leading to decarboxylation with the formation
of a Fe2+(peroxysuccinate) intermediate prior to formation
of the ferryl(succinate). Because the decarboxylation is irreversible, kcat/KM(O2) only reports on steps between the collision with O2 and
this decarboxylation step (Scheme 2).

Studies to date that address O2 activation chemistry in
αKG oxygenases have relied on steady-state mechanistic probes
and point mutagenesis22,45,64−67 and suggest that hydrogen bonding contacts to the αKG play
an important role in facilitating decarboxylation. Further insight
into oxidative decarboxylation has been hampered by the identity of
the rate limiting steps in TauD and other αKG oxygenases. In
the cases of TauD,20 P4H,25 CytC3,32 and by analogy DAOCS68 and the histone demethylase KDM4E,69 HAT by the ferryl or product release are partially
rate-limiting on turnover at elevated O2 concentration,
preventing the accumulation of any species involved in O2 activation during the pre-steady-state. A crucial difference between
these other enzymes and FIH is that several lines of evidence indicate
that decarboxylation is rate limiting in FIH, suggesting that FIH
may allow direct access to steps involved in O2 activation.

Conclusions
We have used multiple kinetic probes to characterize
O2 activation by FIH. Unlike other previously characterized
Fe(II)/αKG enzymes, turnover in FIH is fully limited by the
rate of O2 activation. This kinetic feature is consistent
with the function of FIH as an O2 sensor; strong oxidants
such as the ferryl would be short-lived, ensuring tight coupling between
O2 activation and CTAD hydroxylation. It may be possible
that other biomedically important Fe(II)/αKG enzymes such as
the JmjC and JmjD domain-containing hydroxylases and PHD2 employ a
similar mechanistic strategy to regulate their function. If so, rate-limited
O2 activation may be a more common mechanistic feature
among Fe(II)/αKG oxygenases than is currently appreciated.
