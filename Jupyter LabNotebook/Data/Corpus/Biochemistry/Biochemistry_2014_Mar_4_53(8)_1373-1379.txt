Skeletal
and cardiac muscle
Ca2+ release channels, also known as ryanodine receptors
(RyRs), are responsible for the release of Ca2+ from the
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), an intracellular Ca2+ storage
compartment, during muscle excitation. Both skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac (RyR2) isoforms of RyR are homotetramers
of a 560 kDa subunit and are regulated by various molecules and proteins,
including Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, protein kinases and
phosphatases, and Ca2+ binding proteins such as calmodulin.−

Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations dynamically change
from submicromolar to micromolar levels during muscle excitations,
which regulate RyR ion channels by positive and negative feedback
mechanisms. Mechanical interaction (RyR1) or a small influx of Ca2+ (RyR2) triggers RyR channels to open, and released Ca2+ at a micromolar level possibly allows neighbor RyRs to open
by a positive feedback mechanism. Mechanisms for closing RyR channels
are not well-understood. Several possibilities include Ca2+-dependent inactivation through a direct or indirect mechanism, time-dependent
inactivation, and depletion of SR Ca2+ stores. Ca2+ binding domains were characterized using truncated and full-length
RyR forms.− Point mutations in RyR2 Glu3987 or RyR3 Glu3885 (corresponding to
RyR1 Glu4032) drastically reduced the level of Ca2+-dependent
activation of the channel, which indicated the location of a Ca2+ activation site in RyRs., Other experiments
have revealed two EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites in RyR1 (RyR1
amino acids 4081–4127).− Using truncated forms of proteins,
the affinity for Ca2+ was measured to be 60 μM to
3.8 mM, a range that exceeds the affinities for Ca2+ activation.
The results suggest that the region may be involved in inactivation
of RyRs by millimolar levels of Ca2+. Single-channel studies
indicated that released Ca2+ through RyR inhibits the same
RyR channel;, therefore, it is probable that
cyotoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations reach millimolar levels
locally around the inactivation site of RyRs. RyR1 is inhibited by
∼1 mM Ca2+, but ∼10-fold higher concentrations
are required to inhibit RyR2 channel activities., Therefore, RyR1–RyR2 chimera channels were constructed and
analyzed to identify the Ca2+ inactivation site in RyRs,
revealing that an ∼1300-amino acid sequence in the C-terminus
is responsible for inactivation.,

Another
physiological divalent cation, Mg2+, is well-known
to inhibit RyR activities. Two possible mechanisms of inhibitory effects
by Mg2+ have been recognized. (1) Mg2+ competes
off Ca2+ at the Ca2+ activation site (A site),
and (2) Mg2+ binds to a lower-affinity Ca2+ inactivation
site (I site) to facilitate its inhibitory effects., In addition, Mg2+ was reported to “activate”
RyR2 at 10–100 μM Ca2+. This activation was observed in rat ventricular SR and
rabbit recombinant RyR2, but not in rabbit ventricular SR. Further,
Mg2+ activation has never been reported on RyR1.

Here, we pursued the previous studies using RyR1–RyR2 chimera
channels, to improve our understanding of the structural
basis of differential regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by Ca2+ and Mg2+. We constructed 18 chimeras and determined their
Ca2+-dependent channel activities and Mg2+-dependent
regulation. Two distinct regions were found to be involved in isoform-specific
Ca2+-dependent inhibition of RyR channels. Moreover, we
found that a RyR1–RyR2 chimera carrying the RyR2 EF-hand Ca2+ binding domain was activated by Mg2+.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
[3H]Ryanodine was obtained from
PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA) and unlabeled ryanodine from Calbiochem
(La Jolla, CA). Protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche (Indianapolis,
IN) and Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and human embryonic kidney (HEK)
293 cells from American Type Culture Collection. Full-length wild-type
RyR1 cDNA was provided by G. Meissner (University of North Carolina,
Chapel Hill, NC). Full-length wild-type RyR2 and R1 chimera cDNAs
were provided by J. Nakai (Saitama University, Saitama, Japan).

Construction of RyR cDNAs
Full-length rabbit RyR1 and
RyR2 cDNAs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors pCMV5 and
pCIneo, respectively. RyR1–RyR2 chimera cDNAs were constructed
by using common restriction enzyme sites or by introducing new restriction
enzyme sites by site-directed mutagenesis or by polymerase chain reaction.
Single- and multiple-base changes and deletions were introduced by Pfu-turbo polymerase-based chain reaction, using mutagenic
oligonucleotides and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Complete mutated DNA fragments amplified
by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Sequences and numbering were
described previously.,

Expression of Full-Length
RyRs in HEK293 Cells
RyR
cDNAs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells with FuGene6 (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Cells were maintained
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high-glucose Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and
were plated the day before transfection. For each 10 cm tissue culture
dish, 3.5 μg of cDNA was used, and cells were harvested 48 h
after transfection. To prepare crude membrane fractions, cells were
homogenized with 0.3 M sucrose, 150 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole (pH7.0),
0.1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM glutathione (oxidized),
and protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged for 45 min at
100000g, and pellets were resuspended in the aforementioned
buffer without EGTA and glutathione. Expression levels of RyRs in
each transfection were determined by Bmax measurements of binding of [3H]ryanodine to the crude
membrane fractions (see below).

[3H]Ryanodine
Binding
[3H]Ryanodine
binding experiments were performed with crude membrane fractions as
described previously., Unless otherwise indicated, membranes
were incubated with 2.5 nM [3H]ryanodine in 20 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), 0.15 M sucrose, 200 mM KCl, 0.3 mM glutathione (oxidized),
protease inhibitors, and the indicated Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations. Nonspecific binding was assessed using a
1000–2000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. Effects of Mg2+ on channel activity at 100 μM Ca2+ (Figures C and C) were measured in
the absence of glutathione. After 20 h, samples were diluted with
6 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters preincubated
with 2% polyethyleneimine in water. Filters were washed three times
with 5 mL of an ice-cold 100 mM KCl, 1 mM KPipes (pH 7.0) solution.
The radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by liquid
scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine. In
parallel experiments, the Bmax of [3H]ryanodine binding was determined by incubating homogenates
for 4–5 h with a nearly saturating concentration of 20 nM [3H]ryanodine in 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.0), 0.6 M KCl, protease
inhibitors, and 0.1 mM Ca2+. All experiments were performed
at room temperature (22–24 °C).

Biochemical Assays and
Data Analysis
Free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained
by including the appropriate amounts
of Ca2+ and EGTA in the solutions as determined using the
stability constants and a computer program published by Shoenmakers
et al. Free Ca2+ concentrations
of ≥1 μM were verified with the use of a Ca2+ selective electrode.

Results are given as means ± the
standard error (SE). The significance of the differences in data among
three or more groups (p &lt; 0.05) was determined
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s
test. Otherwise, a Student’s t test was used.

Results
Two Regions in the C-Terminal Quarter of RyRs Are Involved in
Ca2+-Dependent Inactivation
Both RyR1 and RyR2
have similar affinities at the micromolar level for Ca2+ activation, but RyR2 has an ∼10-fold lower affinity for Ca2+ inhibitory effect than RyR1., Studies with
RyR1–RyR2 chimera channels demonstrated that the C-terminal
quarter of RyR is crucial for this difference.,

In this study, we pursued these observations by constructing
and expressing 18 additional RyR1–RyR2 chimera channels. We
measured the binding of [3H]ryanodine to crude membrane
fractions of HEK293 cells expressing recombinant rabbit WT RyR1, WT
RyR2, and the RyR1–RyR2 chimera channels at various Ca2+ concentrations. Ryanodine specifically binds to RyRs and
is widely used as a probe for RyR channel activity because of its
preferential binding to the open state of RyR channels. Accordingly, we used [3H]ryanodine
binding as a measure of the apparent affinity for Ca2+-dependent
activation and inactivation. As shown in Figure.A, we observed an atypical bell-shaped curve with WT RyR2; the curve
had a plateau level at 10–100 μM Ca2+. This
has already been reported in microsomes of rat heart and recombinant
rabbit RyR2. It was also reported that
∼1 mM Mg2+ restored the normal bell-shaped Ca2+-dependent curve of recombinant RyR2 with activation at 10–100
μM Ca2+. We confirmed the effect of 1 mM Mg2+ on the Ca2+-dependent regulation of rabbit recombinant
RyR2, but we did not observe the suppression of WT RyR1 at 10–100
μM Ca2+ in the absence of Mg2+ (Figure A). In this study, we characterized some RyR1–RyR2
chimera channels in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ for comparison
with WT RyR1 and WT RyR2 (see below).

Two regions are involved in isoform-specific
Ca2+-dependent
inactivation of RyRs. (A) Ca2+-dependent changes in the
activities of WT RyR1 (●) and WT RyR2 (○) were measured

(n = 4–9). (B) Schematic of R21 and R0 chimeras

chimeras in the absence (left) or presence (right) of 1 mM Mg2+. Solid red and blue lines represent mean values of WT RyR1
and WT RyR2, respectively, from panel A. Data are means ± SE
(n = 4–5).

In previous studies, RyR1 channels carrying the C-terminal
quarter
of RyR2 [R1 chimera (Figure B)] showed essentially
the same Ca2+ inactivation affinities as WT RyR2., In our study, we confirmed impaired Ca2+-dependent inactivation
of R1 chimera (Figure S1 of the ). The IC50 values of the R1 chimera are &gt;10-fold greater
than that of WT RyR1 and even slightly higher than that of WT RyR2.
To further narrow the critical domain for Ca2+-dependent
inactivation of RyRs, we first divided the C-terminal quarter of RyR2
into two segments and determined Ca2+-dependent regulation
of the two chimera channels (Figure B). Ca2+ inactivation affinities for both the R21 chimera (RyR1 amino
acids 1–3725 and 4299–5038; RyR2 amino acids 3692–4250)
and the R0 chimera (RyR1 amino acids 1–4301; RyR2 amino acids
4254–4968) were between those of WT RyR1 and WT RyR2 (Figure C). Ca2+ activation affinities of R21
and R0 chimeras were comparable with that of WT RyR1 (Table ). The higher EC50 of WT RyR2 is likely
due to the suppression of activities at 10–100 μM Ca2+ in the absence of Mg2+. Apparent IC50 values of Ca2+ for R21 and R0 were significantly higher
than that of WT RyR1 in the absence and presence of 1 mM Mg2+ (Figure B), suggesting that both regions
are required for isoform-specific Ca2+-dependent inactivation.
We also found that activities of R21 chimera were suppressed at 10–100
μM Ca2+, and the suppression was relieved by 1 mM
Mg2+. However, we did not observe the same trend with the
R0 chimera (Figure C; see also Figure C). The results also suggest that Mg2+ activated recombinant WT RyR2 at 10–100 μM Ca2+ through the region highlighted by the R21 chimera (RyR2 amino acids
3692–4250).

Two EF-Hand Ca2+ Binding Motifs Involved in Ca2+-Dependent Inactivation
We further narrowed the
regions that were included in isoform-specific Ca2+ inactivation
of RyR by subdividing the RyR2 region highlighted in R21 chimera channels
(Figure A). This
region contains two EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs (EF1 and
EF2) in tandem.− Four additional RyR1 backbone chimeras were constructed;
they contain either of the two EF-hands (R41 and R51), both (R41′),
or neither (R51′), from the RyR2 sequence. The R51′
chimera showed essentially the same Ca2+ activation and
inactivation profiles as WT RyR1 (Figure B).
The R41 chimera, which contains only EF2 from the RyR2 sequence, had
a slight increase in IC50 compared with that of WT RyR1,
but the difference was not significant in the absence of Mg2+. In contrast, the R41′ chimera, containing both EF1 and EF2
of RyR2, and R51, carrying only EF1 from RyR2, showed significantly
increased IC50 values. These Ca2+-dependent
inactivation curves were similar with that of the R21 chimera (IC50 values were insignificantly different from that of R21 in
the absence of Mg2+). An increase in IC50 for
Ca2+ in R41′ and R51 chimeras was also observed
in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ (Figure A,B). Although the IC50 of R41 was also significantly
increased in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+ compared with that
of WT RyR1, the change was only modest as compared with the IC50 values of R41′ and R51 (Figure A). The results indicate that the EF-hand Ca2+ binding
domain, especially the N-terminal EF-hand (EF1), is a strong determinant
for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of RyR. Among these four
chimera channels, activities of R41′ and possibly R51 chimeras
were suppressed with 10–100 μM Ca2+ (Figure B, left panel). The R41′ chimera was significantly
activated by 1 mM Mg2+ at 100 μM Ca2+ (Figure C). The R51 chimera was subtly but insignificantly
activated, and R41 and R51′ chimeras were not activated (Figure C). The results suggest that EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites are critical for the suppression of recombinant RyR2
at 10–100 μM Ca2+, which is relieved by 1
mM Mg2+.

Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Loop Regions
Involved in Ca2+-Dependent Inactivation
The last
700 amino acids
of RyR2, located in the R0 chimera channel, were further divided into
two regions (Figure A). According to the bioinformatic
sequence analysis and biochemical studies, the region most likely
contains six transmembrane domains, (see also
Figure A). The R61 chimera (RyR1 amino acids
1–4301 and 4582–5037; RyR2 amino acids 4254–4521)
carries a divergent cytoplasmic domain (∼25% homologous) and
the first transmembrane segment from RyR2, and the R71 chimera (RyR1
amino acids 1–4581; RyR2 amino acids 4522–4968) contains
five other RyR2 transmembrane segments together with two cytoplasmic
loops (S2–S3 and S4–S5) and the C-terminal tail. Ca2+-dependent activation and inactivation curves indicated that
R61 was essentially the same as WT RyR1, whereas the IC50 of R71 significantly increased similar to that of the R0 chimera
(Figure B). Neither chimera seemed to be suppressed
at 10–100 μM Ca2+, which is consistent with
the R0 chimera (Figures C, C, and B). The results indicate that
the last 450 amino acids form another critical region for isoform-specific
Ca2+-dependent inactivation.

R121b and R131b are 11.2 ± 1.3 and 12.3 ± 0.7 mM, respectively.
Data are means ± SE (n = 5). (C) Effect of 1
mM Mg2+ on R121b and R131b chimeras. Data are means ±

In the R71 chimera region, the N-terminal half
(RyR2 amino acids
4522–4780) is more divergent (65% identical) than the C-terminal
half (RyR2 amino acids 4781–4968; 93% identical). Therefore,
we further constructed eight chimera RyR channels to identify which
transmembrane region, cytoplasmic loop, or combination of both in
the N-terminal half is important for Ca2+-dependent inactivation
(Figure A,B). As shown in Figure C, the R81b chimera (RyR1 amino acids 1–4629
and 4688–5037; RyR2 amino acids 4560–4617), carrying
the S2 transmembrane of RyR2, showed a higher IC50 than
WT RyR1, and other chimeras containing S2 of RyR2 also had increased
IC50 values.

Two additional chimeras, R121b and R131b,
were constructed to assess
whether the two regions are sufficient for RyR2-type Ca2+-dependent inactivation (Figure A). These chimeras carry RyR2 domains of the S2
transmembrane (R81b) or S2 transmembrane with the S2–S3 cytoplasmic
loop (R91b) in addition to the RyR2 EF-hand region identified in the
R41′ chimera. Ca2+-dependent inactivation of both
chimeras was essentially the same as that of WT RyR2 (Figure B), which suggests that two distinct regions of
RyR are sufficient for isoform-specific Ca2+-dependent
inactivation. One region contains two EF-hand Ca2+ binding
motifs, and the other is the second transmembrane segment and possibly
its flanking region. Activities of both R121b and R131b chimeras were
suppressed at 10–100 μM Ca2+ (Figure B), which is consistent with the involvement of
RyR2-type EF-hands (R41′ region). Consistently, both R121b
and R131b were activated by 1 mM Mg2+ at 100 μM Ca2+ (Figure C).

Discussion
Previous studies with RyR1–RyR2 chimeras have indicated
that the C-terminal quarter of RyRs is crucial for Ca2+-dependent inactivation., Du et al. showed that the replacement of any one of the
three RyR1 domains located in the C-terminal quarter with corresponding
RyR2 domains increased the IC50 for Ca2+ (Figure ). Furthermore, the region corresponding to RyR2
amino acids 4143–4334 represented the middle domain (Figure ). Our current
results with RyR1 backbone chimeras clearly demonstrated that two
distinct regions, the EF-hand domain and the second transmembrane
segment (S2) in RyR1, are required for high-affinity Ca2+-dependent inactivation (∼1 mM). Both regions are involved
in the domains that have been described in the previous papers (Figure ). Although studies with RyR2–backbone chimeras
remain to be performed, our current studies succeeded in narrowing
the regions responsible for Ca2+-dependent inactivation
of RyR1.

Diagram of domains for Ca2+-dependent inactivation.
Sequence domains suggested by RyR1–RyR2 chimera analyses in
previous work,, and this study are shown as open boxes together with other identified
regulatory domains., EF denotes the position of two
EF-hand Ca2+ binding sites. P indicates three potential
phosphorylation sites. CaM represents calmodulin.

We also calculated the gain of activity of each chimera by
normalizing
the peak values of Ca2+-dependent activity to Bmax values (Table S1 of the ). It was reported that RyR1 activity was suppressed
in the native skeletal muscle membrane fraction, whereas RyR2 activity
was relatively high., In the study presented here,
we observed that the average WT RyR2 activity is higher than that
of WT RyR1, but with a less pronounced difference. It is possible
that a lack of accessory proteins such as FK506-binding proteins, and addition of oxidized glutathione, which
specifically regulates RyR1 in the recombinant system, minimized the difference.

The deletion
of the negatively charged region (RyR1 amino acids
1872–1923), known as the D3 divergent region, from RyR1 reduced
the affinity for Ca2+-dependent inactivation by 3-fold. However, a RyR1 backbone chimera carrying the
D3 region of RyR2 was inhibited by Ca2+ with an affinity
similar to that of WT RyR1. Therefore,
deleting a large 52-amino acid sequence possibly caused a conformational
change, allosterically affecting Ca2+-dependent inactivation
rather than highlighting the difference between Ca2+-dependent
inactivation of RyR1 and RyR2.

Our results suggest that the
EF-hand domain is most likely a sensor
for Ca2+-dependent inactivation. The Ca2+ binding
signal could be transmitted to the transmembrane effector site, possibly
located in S2. Ikemoto and colleagues proposed that an interdomain
interaction between the N-terminal and central domains of RyR1 is
crucial for channel regulation. Such
a regulatory mechanism may fit with this long-range interaction; that
is, the conformation of the interaction between the EF-hand domain
and the S2 segment (or possibly their flanking regions) is changed
upon binding of Ca2+ to EF-hands. Studies that include
determination of the proximity between domains by FRET measurements and three-dimensional structure analysis and direct monitoring of domain–domain
interaction need to be performed to test
this hypothesis. Affinities of Ca2+ for recombinant RyR1
and RyR2 EF-hand domains were similar in the equilibrium binding experiments, which does not explain the difference in Ca2+-dependent inactivation of RyR1 and RyR2 channel activities.
A possible explanation is that the affinities of domain interactions
are different, which affects isoform-specific Ca2+-dependent
inactivation.

Fessenden et al. scrambled
amino acid
sequences of EF1 and EF2 in full-length RyR1 and expressed the mutant
RyR1s in 1B5 RyR-deficient myotubes for functional characterization.
They found that the EF1-scrambled mutant showed an ∼2-fold
increase in its IC50 for Ca2+. These results
are in good agreement with the study presented here that EF1 is important
for Ca2+-dependent inactivation (Figure A).

It should be noted that the EC50 values
for Ca2+ of R41′ and R81b chimeras were not essentially
different
from that of WT RyR1 (Table  and Figure B, R81b, Ca2+-dependent activity change
not shown). However, the chimera carrying both RyR2 regions, the R121b
chimera, was substantially activated by a lower concentration of Ca2+ compared to WT RyR1 (Figure C).
A similar effect was observed in the R131b chimera, which carries
the R41′ and R91b chimeric region of RyR2. The same effects
were observed in earlier studies with RyR1–RyR2 chimera channels. As discussed, a conformational change in chimera
channels may affect channel activation. Nevertheless, we found that
Ca2+-dependent inactivation of R121b and R131b were additives
of R41′ and R81b or R91b, which most likely indicates the importance
of two domains in Ca2+-dependent inactivation.

It
was reported that the activities of RyR2 in rat ventricular
muscle, as well as in recombinant rabbit RyR2, were suppressed at
10–100 μM Ca2+, and the suppression was relieved
by 1 mM Mg2+. It is perhaps due to the conformational change
during sample preparation or the lack of accessory proteins; a different
preparation with RyR2 from rabbit ventricular muscle was not activated
by Mg2+. In this study, we
confirmed this effect on recombinant RyR2 and found that the recombinant
rabbit RyR1 was not activated by Mg2+. Although the physiological
significance of the effect remains unknown, we found that the EF-hand
region of RyR2 is responsible for this effect. It is conceivable that
binding of Mg2+ to the EF-hand Ca2+ binding
sites at physiological concentrations (0.5–1 mM) stabilizes
the channel conformation and renders them more sensitive to Ca2+ activation and other modulators.

In summary, we advanced
our understanding of the structure–function
aspect of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of RyRs. Our results
suggest that calcium ions bind to EF-hand regions and the functional
signal is transmitted to the effector site (possible inactivation
gate) in the second transmembrane segment. Thus, further studies for
narrowing the region, ideally at the single-amino acid level, will
lead us to define the molecular structure of the inactivation gate
of RyRs.
