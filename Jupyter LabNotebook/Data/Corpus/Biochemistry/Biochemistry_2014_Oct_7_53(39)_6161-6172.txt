Cytochrome
P450 (P450) subfamily
4A enzymes are historically important and also of considerable interest
because of the biological activity of some of their products. Lauric
acid 12-hydroxylation was the assay used in the first successful P450
solubilization/separation/reconstitution studies of Lu and Coon with
rabbit liver microsomes. Although what
is known today as (rabbit) P450 2B4 was of the most interest in the
subsequent efforts to first purify a mammalian P450, our current knowledge base of catalytic specificity would suggest that a P450 subfamily 4A enzyme
might have been the object of the original study. P450 4A subfamily enzymes have been studied extensively
in several animal models and exhibit activity with a number of lipid
substrates.− In humans, P450 4A11 appears to be the only subfamily 4A P450 enzyme,
with the (CYP) 4A22 gene not encoding an active protein.

The subfamily 4A P450s have several general
properties in common.
They use fatty acids and other long chain compounds as substrates. Part of the heme becomes covalently attached
in several, but this phenomenon does not appear to be linked to catalytic
activity., In contrast to several other P450s that
oxidize fatty acids, many of the subfamily 4A P450s selectively catalyze
ω-hydroxylation because of steric restriction in the active
site. No subfamily 4A P450 crystal structures
are yet available, but some insight into structural features has been
gleaned from site-directed mutagenesis.,

One
of the more interesting translational aspects of (human) P450
4A11 research is the association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism
(rs1126742) with an increased level of salt-sensitive
hypertension. The polymorphism has been
associated with a 40% attenuation of arachidonic acid ω-hydroxylation
activity because of the F434S amino acid substitution associated with
the polymorphism. The reaction product,
20-OH-eicosatetraenoic acid, has been shown to have both hypertensive
and hypotensive properties in animal models. The same reaction is also catalyzed by some human subfamily 4F P450s.,

Although there is considerable interest in P450 4A11 because
of
the biological properties of some of its products,− the amount
of biochemical information about it is limited.,,, With recombinant
P450 4A11 and the prototypic reaction of lauric acid 12-hydroxylation,
varying (respective) kcat and Km values of 15 min–1 and 57
μM, 38 min–1 and
200 μM, and 20 min–1 and 11 μM, respectively, have
all been reported. Maximal activity is achieved in the presence of
cytochrome b5 (b5). Kawashima et al. reported a lack of detectable arachidonic acid
ω-hydroxylation activity by recombinant P450 4A11, but Gainer
et al. did find activity (kcat = 2.2 min–1), as we have in our
own laboratory (with parameters similar to those of Gainer et al., unpublished results).

Despite the interest
in P450 4A11 and its catalytic activities,
very little is known about which step(s) in the catalytic cycle (Figure ) limits activity. Studies with other human and
experimental animal P450s have shown that steps 2, 4, 7, and 9 can
all be rate-limiting in different reactions., We utilized the approach of analyzing rates of individual reaction
steps and measuring KIEs to kinetic models to determine which steps
might be limiting, as has been done with several other P450s.,− We conclude that major factors limiting the rate
of lauric acid 12-hydroxylation are the rate of transfer of an electron
from b5 and the rate of C–H bond
breaking. The intrinsic KIE was attenuated in steady-state kinetic
measurements because it is not the only rate-limiting step.

P450 scheme.

Experimental Procedures
Chemicals
Lauric (dodecanoic) acid (d0, d3, and d23) and
12-OH lauric acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. Lauric acid labeled with only
one isotopic atom (d1 or t1) was prepared by the reaction of 12-bromododecanoic
acid with NaB2H4 or NaB3H 4, respectively, in (CH3)2SO. The d1 (2H) reaction
was conducted on a 10 mmol scale and the t1 (3H) reaction on a 0.10 mmol scale (with 5 mCi of NaB3H4, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis,
MO), and the product was recrystallized from a C2H5OH/H2O mixture. The yields for the two reactions
were 78 and 87%, respectively; the atomic excess of d1-lauric acid was 90%, and the specific radioactivity
of t1-lauric acid was 0.23 mCi/mmol. [1-14C]Lauric acid was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals.
Other chemicals were of the highest commercially available grade.

Enzymes
P450 4A11 was expressed in Escherichia
coli from a pCW4A11 plasmid including a (His)6 tag at the C-terminus. Expression and purification of P450 4A11
were conducted as previously described, with some modifications., Briefly, the E. coli strain transformed with the
pCW(Ori+) vector was inoculated into Terrific Broth (TB)
medium containing 100 μg mL–1 ampicillin and
1.0 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The expression
cultures (1 L) were grown at 37 °C for 3 h and then at 28 °C
while being shaken at 200 rpm for 48 h in 2.8 L Fernbach flasks. The
bacterial inner membrane fraction containing P450 4A11 was isolated
and prepared from TB expression cultures using ultracentrifugation
(105g for 60 min). The prepared membrane
fraction was solubilized overnight at 4 °C in 100 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA,
10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate
(CHAPS) (Anatrace, Maumee, OH). The solubilized fraction, following
ultracentrifugation (105g for 60 min),
was then loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate column (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA), and the proteins were eluted with a buffer containing
300 mM imidazole. The eluted fractions containing P450 4A11 were subsequently
dialyzed at 4 °C against 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.4) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1 mM EDTA. The protein preparations
were &gt;90% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (data not presented).

Rat NADPH-P450 reductase and human b5() were expressed in E. coli and
purified as described previously. Apo-b5 was prepared from b5 by acid-acetone
extraction as described previously.,Pseudomonas sp. protocatechuate dioxygenase was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Microsomes were prepared form a mixture of 10 individual human liver
samples (mixed on the basis of equal mass) using a general differential
centrifugation procedure. The source
of the human liver tissue was the Nashville Regional Organ Procurement
Agency (approved by the Institutional Review Board).

Enzymatic Assays
Typical incubations included 0.2 μM
P450 4A11, 0.4 μM NADPH-P450 reductase, 0.4 μM b5, 150 μM l-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, and the indicated concentration
of lauric acid (usually added as an aqueous solution of sodium laurate)
in a final volume of 0.50 mL. b5 was included
because it stimulated the catalytic activity (Figure ). Following temperature equilibration to 37 °C for 5
min, reactions were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-regenerating
system consisting of 0.5 mM NADP+, 10 mM glucose 6-phosphate,
and 1 IU mL–1 yeast glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reactions generally proceeded at 37 °C
for 15 min and were terminated with 1.0 mL of CH2Cl2 and the mixtures centrifuged (103g for 10 min). A 0.8 mL aliquot of the CH2Cl2 layer (lower phase) was transferred to a clean tube. An additional
1.0 mL of CH2Cl2 was added to the supernatant
to extract the products, followed by centrifugation at 103g. The organic layers were combined, and the solvent
was removed under a N2 stream.

Effect of b5 on lauric acid 12-hydroxylation
activity of P450 4A11. Products were measured using the GC method,
using a substrate concentration of 100 μM.

For GC–MS analysis, the dried extracts were converted
to
trimethylsilyl ethers by incubation with 50 μL of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing
trimethylchorosilane [1% (v/v)] at 75 °C for 20 min [procedure
based on BSTFA product specification/typical procedure provided by
the supplier (Supelco/Sigma-Aldrich) (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Supelco/Product_Information_Sheet/4746.pdf)]. The derivatized samples were allowed to cool, mixed using a vortex
device, and transferred to sealed Teflon-capped glass vials for autoinjection
on a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph, using an Rtx-5 column [5%
diphenyl/95% dimethylpolysiloxane capillary (w/w)] [30 m × 0.32
mm (inside diameter) × 0.25 μm (film thickness)], as previously
described. 10-Hydroxydecanoic acid was
used as an internal standard. Hydroxylated products of lauric acid
at the ω and ω-1 positions were identified by their characteristic
mass fragmentation patterns. Turnover numbers of the hydroxylation
of lauric acid at the ω and ω-1 positions by P450 4A11
were determined by a GC flame ionization detector (Shimadzu GC2010
instrument with a flame ionization detector). The distribution of
products was based on the relative peak areas of the GC chromatograms
(using 10-hydroxydecanoic acid as an internal standard). Similar rates
were observed for GC–MS and the radioactive assays (vide infra).

In the case of reactions with human liver
microsomes, the microsomes
(1 mg of protein mL–1) were used directly with the
lauric acid substrates and the NADPH-generating system.

With
1-14C-labeled lauric acid as a substrate, the dried
extracts were dissolved in 100 μL of CH3OH and then
aliquots were analyzed on a reversed-phase (octadecylsilane, C18) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column [5
μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm (Waters, Milford, MA)] coupled with
a radioisotope detector (IN/US Systems β-RAM, Tampa, FL). Reaction
products and substrate were eluted at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min–1 using an increasing linear gradient of CH3CN [including 0.1% (v/v) HCO2H] from 40 to 95% (v/v) over
30 min.

Steady-state kinetic results were fit to hyperbolic
plots in GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to determine kcat and Km values, plus the
standard error (SE) [see also  (vide infra)].

Spectral Binding Titrations
Purified P450 4A11 was
diluted to 2.0 μM in 0.10 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4),
and binding spectra (350–500 nm) were recorded following subsequent
additions of lauric acid or 12-OH lauric acid using an OLIS-Aminco
DW2a spectrophotometer (Online Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA) as
described previously., The difference between the absorbance
maximum and minimum was plotted versus the ligand concentration, and
binding constants (Kd) and the SE were
estimated using GraphPad Prism, either using either a hyperbolic fit
or a quadratic equation.

Burst Kinetic Analysis
Burst kinetic
analysis of lauric
acid hydroxylation was conducted in a quench-flow apparatus (model
RQF-3, KinTek Corp., State College, PA) as previously described. P450 4A11 (100 pmol) was reconstituted as described
above and incubated in the presence of 100 μM [1-14C]lauric acid, in a total volume of 20 μL (per injection).
Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing with 20 μL of 10 mM
NADPH for a period of time ranging from 0.5 s to 4 min (as indicated)
at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with 300 μL of 3% (w/v)
CCl3CO2H, and the production of 12-OH lauric
acid was quantitated using HPLC as described for steady-state reactions.

Kinetic Isotope Effects (KIEs)
Noncompetitive (intermolecular)
KIEs
Noncompetitive
(intermolecular) KIEs were measured by comparing kcat and Km values measured
with d0-, d3-, and d23-lauric acid as substrates,
using the conventions of Northrop, for expressing
KIEs as DV = Hkcat/Dkcat and D(V/K) = (Hkcat/HKm)/(Dkcat/DKm). KIEs were measured for both 12- and 11-hydroxylation.

Competitive (intermolecular) KIEs
Competitive (intermolecular)
KIEs were examined by incubating the P450 4A11 system with an equimolar
mixture of d0- and d23-lauric acid (100 μM each) and measuring the relative
amounts of 11- and 12-OH lauric acid formed by GC–MS. All four
peaks were separated from each other because of the effect of the
deuterium isotope on chromatography (tR values of 16.5, 17.0, 19.0, and 19.4 min for d22-11-OH lauric acid, d0-11-OH
lauric acid, d22-12-OH lauric acid, and d0-12-OH lauric acid, respectively).

Intramolecular
(competitive) Deuterium KIEs
Intramolecular
(competitive) deuterium KIEs were measured using d1-lauric acid by LC–MS of the product 12-OH lauric
acid, with the KIE being equal to 2 times the ratio of the intensities
of the peaks at m/z 215 (d0) and 216 (d1),
after correction for 13C contributions and the atomic excess of the d1 substrate. (The statistical factor of 2 was used because all lauric
acid molecules in the reaction have two C–H bonds and one C–D
bond at C-12.)

An Intramolecular Tritium KIE
An
intramolecular tritium
KIE was estimated using t1-lauric acid
(0.23 mCi mmol–1). Incubations with 100 μM t1-lauric acid were terminated after 15 min at
37 °C via the addition of 50 μL of 6 M HCl. The aqueous
reaction mixture was washed five times with 5 volumes of (C2H5)2O. The radioactivity in the aqueous phase
was measured using a liquid scintillation counter to estimate the
amount of t-H2O released, and the (C2H5)2O phase was evaporated to dryness.
The residue was dissolved in CH3CN, and an aliquot was
used to measure tritium retention in 12-OH lauric acid by HPLC, using
a radio-flow detector. The tritium KIE, T(V/K), was expressed as (disintegrations per minute
of 12-OH lauric acid)/(disintegrations per minute of 3H2O) [because the protiated lauric acid is in a large excess
of tritium and exchange of lauric acid with the enzyme is fast (vide infra), the competition is between the C–T bond
and all of the C–H bonds in the lauric acid pool].

Intrinsic
Deuterium KIE (Dk)
The intrinsic
deuterium KIE (Dk) was
estimated from the deuterium and tritium KIE values using the approach
of Northropand
the appropriate tables.

Pre-Steady-State
Kinetics
General
Pre-steady-state
kinetic analysis was conducted
using an OLIS RSM-1000 instrument (Online Instrument Systems, Bogart,
GA), in the rapid-scanning absorbance mode. Typical conditions used
1.24 mm slits and 600-line, 300 nm gratings. The temperature was 37
°C in the case of the measurements involving substrate and product
binding and reduction of ferric P450 4A11.

Substrate and Product Binding
One syringe contained
2.0 μM P450 4A11 in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4);
the other syringe contained 100 μM lauric acid or 12-OH lauric
acid [added from a CH3OH stock, final concentration of
0.5% (v/v) CH3OH in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.4)]. From the collected spectra, traces of ΔA390 and ΔA418 were fit
to progress curves using DynaFit.

Reduction of Ferric P450 4A11
Anaerobic
tonometers− containing the reagents were used to load the stopped-flow
syringes,
which had been scoured overnight with a mixture of 1 mM protocatechuic
acid and 0.03 unit mL–1Pseudomonas sp. protocatechuate dioxygenase. The contents of the tonometers
and syringes were under a CO atmosphere (positive pressure). One syringe
contained 2 μM P450 4A11, 2.4 μM NADPH-P450 reductase,
60 μM l-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,
and (when indicated) 200 μM sodium laurate in 100 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The other syringe contained 300 μM
NADPH in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer. Both syringes contained
an oxygen scrubbing system composed of 1 unit mL–1 protocatechuate dioxygenase and 0.25 mM protocatechuate. Plots of
decreases in A390 were used in that the
ΔA450 rates were found to be slower
because of an unexpectedly slow rate of CO binding (vide infra).

Oxidation of b5
b5 (3.0 μM)
in 200 mM Tris-acetate buffer
containing 75 μM l-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 10 mM EDTA, and 1 μM 5-deazaflavin was photoreduced, as monitored in an OLIS-Cary
14 spectrophotometer (Online Instrument Systems) (2–3 min with
a 500 W lamp positioned 15 cm away, immersed in a beaker of H2O to prevent heating) and then transferred anaerobically to
the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, where it was mixed with an equal
volume of air-saturated 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
(The amines Tris and EDTA are sources of electrons.) Traces of ΔA409 and ΔA424 were fit to single-exponential plots.

The experiment was repeated with 3.0 μM P450 4A11 or
a mixture of 3.0 μM P450 4A11 and 3.0 μM b5, in the presence of 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.
Reduction was also conducted with 1 μM 5-deazaflavin and light
(vide supra). Absorbance changes at 424 and 409 nm
were used to estimate the rate of b5 oxidation
upon reaction of O2 with ferrous P450 4A11.

Other
Assays
NADPH oxidation rates were estimated by
ΔA340 measurements using 0.15 μM
NADPH (no generating system; Δε340 = 6.22 mM–1 cm–1). Formation of H2O2 in reactions (500 μL) was initiated by adding
50 μL of 10 mM NADPH and terminated with the addition of 1.0
mL of CCl3CO2H [3% (w/v)] after 2 min. H2O2 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically
following reaction with ferroammonium sulfate and KSCN. Reduction of O2 to H2O
was estimated by a subtractive method described previously.

Kinetic Fitting
DynaFit was used to fit some of the kinetic and binding
data, e.g., substrate
and product binding ().

Results
Reaction Stoichiometry
Lauric acid
hydroxylation was
demonstrated to be stimulated by b5 (Figure  and Figure S1 of the ). A similar dependence has been found for ω-hydroxylaiton
of arachidonic acid with P450 4A11. Apo-b5 was not effective (Figure S1 of the ). Analysis of the overall reaction stoichiometry
showed a pattern typical of mammalian P450s, with ∼30% of the
electrons from NADPH used for hydroxylation of lauric acid (Table ). All studies were conducted with 1 mM dithiothreitol
or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine present, in that these reductants
(or glutathione) were consistently found to enhance catalytic activity
2–3-fold. The remainder of the reducing equivalents were used
to reduce O2 to H2O2 and H2O (Table ).

Stoichiometry of P450 4A11 Lauric
Acid Hydroxylation
reaction	rate (min–1)	
NADPH oxidation	28 ± 1	
lauric acid 12-hydroxylation	8.6 ± 0.5	
H2O2 formation	13 ± 3	
H2O formation	3 ± 1	
Results are presented
as means ±
the standard deviation (SD) (range) of duplicate assays.

H2O formation was determined
by calculating the difference between NADPH oxidized and the sum of
H2O2 formation and products produced and then
dividing by 2 (the SD for H2O formation estimated from
the square of sums of squares of individual SD values).

To
define the steps that limit the overall rate, we analyzed the
rates of individual steps.

Substrate Binding (step 1 of Figure )
450 4A11, as isolated, is in a mixed
iron spin state,
mostly in the low-spin form; second-derivative analysis, indicated ∼10% high-spin iron. Addition of lauric acid is
associated with a shift in the spin state to high spin (“type
I”). The apparent Kd was 6.7 ± 0.3 μM. Fitting of the rate of
the change (Figure ) yielded an apparent kon of 2 × 106 M–1 s–1 (1.2 × 108 M–1 min–1) and a koff of
4 s–1 (240 min–1), assuming a
two-state model (Kd = 2 μM). This kon value is on the same order of magnitude of
rate constants reported for P450 2A6, much faster than seen for some other P450s for which productive
binding probably involves multiple steps.,

Rates
of binding of lauric acid and 12-OH lauric acid to P450 4A11.
The samples were mixed in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer as described
in . Because of the
low Kd values, estimates were made by
fitting the reaction of 2 μM P450 4A11 and 2 μM ligand
using DynaFit. Panels A and B show the changes in signals in opposite
directions for the binding of lauric acid, and panel C shows the binding
of 12-OH lauric acid. The red lines are fits to the rate constants
that follow, using DynaFit (). (A and B) Lauric acid: kon = 2 ×
10 M–1 s–1 or 1.2 × 108 M–1 min–1, and koff = 4.0 s–1 or 240 min–1. (B) 12-OH lauric acid: kon = 2 × 106 M–1 s–1 or 1.2 × 108 M–1 min–1, and koff = 1.3 s–1 or 78 min–1.

Product Release (step 9 of Figure )
Interaction of 12-OH lauric acid with P450 4A11 resulted in a shift
of the basal high-spin iron component to a low-spin component, yielding
a spectral change that was the opposite of that seen for the substrate
lauric acid (or other fatty acids) and sometimes termed “reverse
type I” (Figure B). Titration with 12-OH lauric acid yielded an apparent Kd of 5.1 ± 2.1 μM (Figure D). Analysis of the kinetics of binding yielded
an apparent kon of 2 × 106 M–1 s–1 (1.2 × 108 M–1 min–1) and a koff of 1.3 s–1 (240 min–1), assuming a two-state model. The koff rate is much faster than the overall rate of catalysis (Table ). An experiment designed to detect a possible burst
reaction was clearly negative (Figure ), indicating
that a rate-determining step does not occur after product formation.

Lauric acid. (B) 12-OH Lauric acid. The Kd values for (C) lauric acid and (D) 12-OH lauric acid were 6.7 ±

and SE were calculated from the single titrations shown in the plots,
utilizing GraphPad Prism.

Lack of burst kinetics for P450 4A11-catalyzed ω-hydroxylation
of lauric acid. The assays were conducted with 100 pmol of P450 at
37 °C. (A) Conventional steady-state kinetics. (B) A rapid quench
apparatus was used for short time intervals. The resulting data points
are fit to rates using linear regression analysis. The horizontal
line in panel B (100 pmol of product, i.e., y-axis
100) is drawn to represent a single turnover of the enzyme.

Reduction of Ferric P450
4A11
Ferric P450 4A11 was
reduced by NADPH-P450 reductase in the presence of the substrate lauric
acid (50 μM), under anaerobic conditions. The rates measured
at 390 and 418 nm (decreased absorbance) represent the reduction of
the high- and low-spin components, respectively, and were nearly identical
[340 ± 10 and 280 ± 25 min–1, respectively,
for the fast phase (Figure )]. In both cases,
a slower second phase (5 ± 1 and 6 ± 1 min–1, respectively) followed.

Reduction of ferric P450 4A11 and CO binding
to Fe2+ P450 4A11. The samples were mixed in a stopped-flow
spectrophotometer
as described in . Traces
are shown for reactions that included 100 μM lauric acid. The
red lines show fits to the estimated rates, using the OLIS software
(parallel first-order rates in panels A–C and pseudo-first-order
rate in panel D). (A) The rates of the fast phase were 0.80 ±
0.05 s–1 and 48 ± 3 min–1 and of the slow phase 0.080 ± 0.01 s–1 and
4.8 ± 0.6 min–1. (B) The rates of the fast
phase were 5.7 ± 0.2 s–1 and 340 ± 10
min–1 and of the slow phase 0.080 ± 0.01 s–1 and 4.8 ± 0.6 min–1. (C) The
rates of the fast phase were 4.7 ± 0.4 s–1 and
280 ± 24 min–1 and of the slow phase 0.10 ±
0.02 s–1 and 6.0 ± 1.2 min–1. (D) For binding of CO to Fe2+ P450 4A11, the rate was
1.1 ± 0.1 s–1 or 66 ± 7 min–1.

P450 reduction experiments are
usually monitored at 450 nm, recording
the formation of the Fe2+–CO complex. In this case
(Figure ), the kinetics of the fast phase
(at 454 nm) were much slower than those measured at 390 or 418 nm,
i.e., 48 ± 3 min–1. This apparent discrepancy
was shown to be due to an unexpectedly slow rate of CO binding (Figure D). At 50% (v/v) CO (nominal aqueous concentration
of ∼500 μM), the rate measured for the binding of CO
was 66 min–1 (1.1 s–1), corresponding
to a second-order rate constant of ∼2 × 103 M–1 s–1 (1.2 × 105 M–1 min–1), much less than expected
for a diffusion-controlled reaction. Other P450s have shown high rate
constants; e.g., for P450 101A1, a reported rate constant is 5 ×
106 M–1 s–1, 50-fold
higher.

Transfer of the Second
Electron to the P450 4A11 Fe2+–O2 Complex
from b5
P450 4A11 reactions are
stimulated ∼2-fold by b5 (Figure ), as reported
previously by others. Apo-b5, devoid of heme, was not able to stimulate P450 4A11
lauric acid hydroxylation (Figure S1 of the ). These results indicate that b5 functions in this case by transferring an electron to
the FeO22+ entity (Figure ).

b5 was photochemically reduced
and mixed with air, being oxidized at a rate of 0.11 min–1 at 23 °C (data not shown). The experiment was repeated in the
presence of photochemically reduced P450 4A11. A separate experiment
with reduced P450 4A11 alone (reduction verified spectrally before
introduction into the stopped-flow syringes) did not show a clear
FeO22+–complex spectrum. When the mixture
of reduced P450 4A11 and b5 was mixed
with air, the b5 was oxidized at a rate
of 0.8 min–1 (at 23 °C), as judged by absorbance
measurements at 390 and 424 nm (Figure ).
These studies indicate that the rate of b5 electron transfer to the FeO22+ form of P450
4A11 is relatively slow (∼1 min–1 at 23 °C),
consistent with the modest enhancement (2-fold at 37 °C) of rates
by b5 (Figures  and ).

and 1.0 μM 5-deazaflavin [in 200 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH
7.4) containing 10 mM EDTA], was deoxygenated and then photoreduced
(500 W lamp, 3 × 1 min) (verified using steady-state spectroscopy).
The sample was introduced into the stopped-flow spectrophotometer
and mixed with an equal volume of air-saturated 100 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (23 °C). Analysis of the data yielded first-order rates
of 0.079 ± 0.010 min–1 at 409 nm and 0.080
± 0.013 min–1 at 424 nm. When the rate of reoxidation
of photochemically reduced b5 was analyzed
under these conditions in the absence of P450 4A11, the reoxidation
rate was 0.11 min–1 (data not shown).

C–H Bond Breaking and KIEs with Recombinant
P450 4A11
One approach to judging the influence of the rate
of C–H
bond breaking on the overall reaction is the use of KIEs.,, Preliminary KIE studies with d0 and d23 (perdeutero)
lauric acid suggested a relatively low KIE in noncompetitive (intermolecular)
steady-state kinetic studies (Table ). This
was the case for both 12- and 11-hydroxylation (the latter accounting
for &lt;10% of the product).

Products were measured
using the
GC method. The SE estimates are derived form within each hyperbolic
fit of plots of the reaction rate (v) vs substrate
concentration (S) in GraphPad Prism, and the SE in
the quotients is the fractional square root of the sum of the fractional
squares of the SE in both operators. The variation in the Km values for 11-hydroxylation is attributed
to the low rate for this reaction; e.g., see the plot for the microsomal
reaction in Figure .

More detailed studies were conducted with 12-d3-lauric acid (Figure ), in which
C–H bonds are substituted with deuterium only at the major
site of hydroxylation, i.e., C–H bond breakage. These experiments
also yielded low KIEs in noncompetitive, intermolecular experiments
(Table ). Inverse KIEs (i.e., &lt;1) were
also observed for the minor product, 11-OH lauric acid (Table ).

Effect of deuteration at carbon 12 on product distribution

to a KIE. The bottom traces show GC traces with d0-lauric acid (with or without NADPH), and the top traces
show the corresponding experiment with 12-d3-lauric acid (100 μM in each case), with or without NADPH.
The peaks identified as 11- and 12-OH lauric acid are designated with
arrows, as is the internal standard 10-OH lauric acid.

The low KIEs could be used to infer rapid C–H
bond cleavage.
However, the observed “metabolic switching” (from 12- to 11-hydroxy product) is not consistent
with this view. For a more appropriate analysis of the KIE, it is
necessary to know the intrinsic KIE (Dk) for C–H bond cleavage at carbon 12.

One approach to
estimating Dk is with
the use of an “isotopically sensitive branching” method,
which can be applied when a minor product is also produced., In the literature, this method has been applied to kcat (DV) results (actually
applied to single-value results measured at high substrate concentrations)., With the knowledge that the reaction is irreversible and ignoring
secondary KIEs, Jones et al. transformed
eq 1 (which is eq 10 of ref ())into
eq 2which when transposed to the P450
4A11 system
with the nomenclature used here givesand in this case
(Table ) leads toand Dk = 13, the
apparent intrinsic isotope effect, which is consistent with the large
degree of metabolic switching (Table ).

An alternate approach to estimating Dk comes from Northrop, using noncompetitive
intramolecular KIEs (V/K) and the
relationshipusing
the nomenclature applied in this paper.
We used MS analysis of the 12-OH lauric acid obtained from an incubation
of 12-d1-lauric acid to determine a D(V/K) value of 1.9 ±
0.1 (n = 3). 12-t1-Lauric
acid was prepared, and the ratio of tritium in the 3H2O (from cleavage of the C–T bond) and [3H]-12-OH lauric acid (cleavage of the C–H bond, divided by
2 for statistical reasons) was used to calculate a T(V/K) of 3.5 ± 0.1 (n = 3). Solving the equation and using a set of tables,Dk ∼ 20 and Tk ∼ 77 (with a 14% SE).

The
overall conclusion is that the 12-hydroxylation reaction has
a relatively high intrinsic KIE, Dk, of
10–20, typical of a number of P450s.,,, The observed
(noncompetitive) KIE is attenuated but still significant in the steady-state
kinetic results.

Competitive (intermolecular) KIEs were measured
using an equimolar
mixture of d0- and d23-lauric acid. The KIE for 12-hydroxylation was 1.3 ±
0.2, and the KIE for 11-hydroxylation was 0.9 ± 0.1.

KIEs with Human
Liver Microsomes
P450 4A11 is a major
lauric acid ω-hydroxylase in liver microsomes, and we compared
some of the KIE results, in this context of a more functional biological
system. Only the work with d0- and 12-d3-lauric acid was done (Figure ). As in the case of
purified P450 4A11, 11-hydroxylation was a minor reaction. From the
results obtained here, the following values were calculated for 12-hydroxylation: DV = 1.2 ± 0.2, and D(V/K) = 2.1 ± 0.7. For 11-hydroxylation,
the values were as follows: DV = 1.0 ±
1.2, and D(V/K) = 0.15
± 0.26. The high SEs in the 11-hydroxylation results are due
to the low rates observed with the d0 substrate,
but the graph conveys the conclusion that the patterns (low KIE for
12-hydroxylation, strong metabolic switching to 11-hydroxylation)
are similar to those with the purified enzyme system.

The methods are described in . Assays were conducted in duplicate, and the points indicate the
means ± the range. As described in , parameters were estimated using hyperbolic fits
in GraphPad Prism, and SE values are from those fits. Rates are expressed
on a milligram protein basis. The following parameters were obtained:
for d0 12-hydroxylation, Vmax = 1.10 ± 0.06 nmol of product formed min–1 (mg of protein)−1 and Km = 48 ± 7 μM; for d3 12-hydroxylation, Vmax = 0.94 ±
0.11 nmol of product formed min–1 (mg of protein)−1 and Km = 86 ± 22
μM; for d0 11-hydroxylation, Vmax = 0.96 ± 1.18 nmol of product formed
min–1 (mg of protein)−1 and Km = 1890 ± 2530 μM; for d3 11-hydroxylation, Vmax =
0.96 ± 0.12 nmol of product formed min–1 (mg
of protein)−1 and Km = 288 ± 55 μM.

Discussion
Although human P450 4A11 has been the subject
of considerable interest
because of its potential role in hypertension, there is no crystal structure and relatively little work
has been published regarding its mechanism or, for that matter, any
of the subfamily 4A P450s.,,, In this study, we considered
a prototypic ω-hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by P450 4A11
and what steps are at least partially rate-limiting in catalysis.
We conclude that at least two steps in the catalytic cycle, steps
4 and 7, contribute to the overall steady-state rate. Steps 1, 2,
and 9 were shown to be rapid and because of this do not affect the
overall rate.

The binding and release of ligands, at least the
substrate and
product, appear to be faster and simpler than in the case of some
of the other human P450s, e.g., 3A4,, 1A2, and 19A1. These
P450s appear to have more complex, multiphasic kinetics, and movement
to the proximity of the iron is a slower, more complex process, which
in some of the cases involves multiple ligands being present., The differences may be due to the size of the active site, although
this is still unknown in the case of P450 4A11. The fatty acid arachidonic
acid is almost twice as long as lauric acid and is still a substrate. It is possible that P450 4A11 has a much more
rigid site, but this is also a matter of speculation. What is known
is that subfamily 4A P450s have restricted active sites, which is
somewhat intuitive as evidenced by their proclivity to oxidize terminal
methyl groups, an energetically unfavorable reaction. Evidence of
the oxygenation of even a chlorine atom positioned at the ω
position has been presented.

b5 stimulates a number of P450s in
an “allosteric” mode, instead of electron transfer. One can speculate that b5 may act in this mode because of its ability to bind and restrict
motion of a flexible protein. P450s 2E1 and 2A6 also require electron
transfer for the stimulatory effect of b5,, and these enzymes are known to have relatively
rigid, compact structures.,

The reduction
of P450 4A11 is relatively rapid in the catalytic
cycle (Figure ). Binding of lauric acid clearly
shifts the iron equilibrium toward the high-spin form (Figure ). However, both high- and low-spin P450 4A11 iron
showed similar rates of reduction by NADPH-P450 reductase (Figure ). Although the view has been expressed that a shift
in oxidation–reduction potential is associated with substrate
binding and spin-state changes, equivalent
rates of reduction of high- and low-spin P450 iron have been shown
here (Figure ) and for P450 1A2.

The slow rate of CO binding (Figure D)
was unexpected; we have not noticed this previously with other mammalian
P450s.,,,, The reason for the
slow binding is unknown. Some plant P450s have low CO affinity, but this is a case of a slow kon rather than a fast koff. There can be speculation about restricted access to the heme iron,
based on the work with a rat orthologue. One question that arises is whether O2 access is also
restricted. However, we were unable to detect an Fe2+–O2 complex in our work (Figure ). If
the rate of O2 access were similar to that of CO (∼60
min–1), it would still be faster than overall turnover
but could begin to contribute in that the overall rate of O2 consumption is 28 min–1 for the enzyme (Table ).

There has been considerable interest in
identifying rate-limiting
steps in P450 reactions since research in the field began.− KIEs were used in some early work,,, although in many of these cases, it is not possible
to interpret whether the finding of a significant primary KIE meant
that C–H bond breaking contributed to a change in rate. Today
there is no consensus regarding a single, unified rate-limiting step
in all P450 reactions. However, in several cases, there is evidence
that certain steps are limiting (this varies depending upon the experimental
system and the particular oxidation reaction being studied). In the
human P450 7A1-catalyzed 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol, reduction
of the ferric iron was concluded to be the most rate-limiting step. With some P450s, there is evidence that b5 stimulates reactions, and if apo-b5 does not, then presumably b5 is donating an electron to the Fe2+–O2 complex to facilitate the reaction (i.e., that step must be limiting). This is the case with at least some of the catalyses
of human P450 2A6 and 2E1. With human P450 2E1 and the oxidation of ethanol,
the most rate-limiting step follows product formation,, giving rise to burst kinetics and a KIE on Km. For several P450s, high KIE values are observed in noncompetitive
experiments, e.g., P450s 1A2, 2A6, and 2D6, indicative
of major C–H bond breaking limitation on rates.

KIE studies
can be complicated in that enzymatic reactions are
complex and include multiple steps, only one of which is generally
involved in C–H bond cleavage., Two kinds
of KIE measurements are particularly relevant for estimating the contribution
of C–H bond cleavage to an overall reaction rate: (i) the intrinsic
KIE (Dk), which is an estimate for the
KIE of the individual chemical C–H bond breaking step, and
(ii) the noncompetitive intermolecular KIE, preferably D(V/K), which expresses the degree
to which the Dk is expressed. A low D(V/K) value coupled with
a high Dk indicates that C–H bond
breaking is not a very rate-limiting step in the overall reaction. While measurement of D(V/K) (and DV) (Table ) is generally straightforward (if a suitable deuterated
substrate is available), estimating Dk for a reaction may be more complex because of “masking”
that results from “commitment to catalysis” and related
factors.

Two main approaches to
estimating Dk have been used, the isotopically
sensitivie branching methodand the tritium
isotope method (“Northrop
method”)., The former can be applied when
there is metabolic switching to an alternate product, as in the case of ω-1 hydroxylation here (Figure ). The Northrop approach requires the comparison
of D(V/K) and T(V/K) with similarly labeled substrates,
which is possible here through chemical synthesis, and had been previously
applied to other P450 reactions., Both approaches
yielded high values for Dk, 13 and ∼20,
respectively. These values may be compared with the low expressed
values of DV and D(V/K) observed for ω-hydroxylation
(1.2–2.3) in Table , indicating weak
expression of a high intrinsic KIE. The situation is similar to that
of P450 3A4-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydoxylation, with a high Dk value established by Northrop’s
method but a low observed D(V/K).

The concept of a
relatively low KIE in typical experiments but
a high intrinsic KIE is not novel, having been revealed by Miwa, Lu,
and their associates with ethoxycoumarin reactions. One question that can be asked is what the relationship
is between the magnitude of a primary KIE (for a noncompetitive intermolecular
comparison) and the contribution of a rate-limiting step. The situation is complex with a P450 system,
in that some of the steps (Figure ) are reversible
and there are also steps that result in the production of reduced
and partially reduced oxygen species (Table ). In previous work with another rabbit P450 1A2, kinetic modeling
suggested that a KIE of 8.4 was related to an estimated 11-fold change
in the rate of the C–H bond cleavage step due to deuteration, but relating a smaller KIE to an actual ratio
is more difficult. With the information available here, we can conclude
that only step 7 (Figures  and ) contributes at least partially to limiting rates of hydroxylation.

Generalized
catalytic P450 scheme with measured rates or rate constants.

In conclusion, we have analyzed
the P450 4A11 catalytic mechanism
and found two steps that appear to be partly rate-limiting, steps
4 and 7 (Figure ). Steps 1, 2, and 9 all
appear to be too fast to be rate-limiting. We have not measured rates
of steps 3, 5, 6, and 8, which are all more difficult or not even
possible. Efforts to characterize a rate-limiting step by the nature
of the accumulating spectral species in the steady state were unsuccessful
because of the dominance of ferrous b5 in the spectra (data not presented). Another point that should be
made, in closing, is that the overall flux of the catalytic cycle
(Figures  and ) is
a function of not only forward rates but also the leakiness of the
system and abortive reduction of oxygen (Figure  and Table ), which can undermine
the catalytic efficiency of the system.
