Phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation
are the major reversible intracellular post-translational modifications
of serine and threonine residues. Phosphorylation in humans is controlled
by more than 650 protein kinases and protein phosphatases, which provide
exquisite control over site-specific phosphorylation at numerous sites
in proteins, with the majority of intracellular proteins subject to
phosphorylation. In contrast, in humans,
OGlcNAcylation (β-O-GlcNAc modification of
serine or threonine, via addition of β-d-N-acetylglucosamine) is controlled by only one OGlcNAc transferase
(OGT), with three isoforms in humans, which adds OGlcNAc, and only
one OGlcNAcase (OGA), which removes OGlcNAc (Figure )., Despite this more limited set of enzymes
for the addition and removal of β-O-GlcNAc,
hundreds of intracellular proteins have been positively identified
as being modified by OGlcNAcylation, with OGlcNAc cycling on serine
and threonine residues on time scales similar to those of phosphorylation.
OGlcNAcylation is responsive to energy homeostasis and nucleotide,
amino acid, and lipid availability, with sugar transfer via UDP-OGlcNAc,
providing responsiveness to metabolism, stress, and nutrient access. Interestingly, OGlcNAcylation often occurs at
sites of phosphorylation, with the effects of OGlcNAcylation sometimes
opposing those of phosphorylation, and sometimes having effects that
are similar to those of phosphorylation., Competing phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation appear to be particularly important in transcription,
including modifications of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain,
c-myc, CREB, C/EBP, and the estrogen receptor, among other examples.,−

Phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation are dynamic intracellular post-translational
modifications of serine and threonine residues of proteins. OGT denotes O-GlcNAc transferase and OGA O-GlcNAcase.

To provide a structural basis
for understanding some of the effects
of phosphorylation versus OGlcNAcylation, we examine herein the effects
of phosphorylation versus OGlcNAcylation within the α-helix,
the most common protein secondary structure. The effects of phosphorylation
on α-helical structure have been examined in a number of contexts,
including model α-helical peptides, coiled coil peptides, and
designed peptides.− The effects of phosphorylation on structure have also been examined
in random coil, polyproline II helix (PPII), and β-hairpin contexts,
as well as within globular proteins.−

In model α-helices, Doig found that phosphoserine (pSer)
stabilized the α-helix when at or near the N-terminus (N-cap
or first three residues of the α-helix) and destabilized the
α-helix when in the interior. Doig
also found that phosphoserine could be stabilizing in the interior
of an α-helix when phosphoserine was located with an i, i + 4 relationship with respect to a
lysine residue. No examination of the
effects of threonine phosphorylation, or of modification at the C-terminus
of the α-helix, was conducted in these critical initial studies.
In a model peptide and in a designed four-helix bundle, De Grado found
that an Arg-X-pSer sequence was highly stabilizing at the N-terminus
of the α-helix, with phosphorylation at all four sites of the
tetramer resulting in a significant stabilization of the helical bundle
relative to the nonphosphorylated bundle. In contrast, Vinson found substantial destabilization of a coiled
coil upon phosphorylation at an interior helical position, with greater
destabilization due to phosphothreonine (pThr) than phosphoserine. Interestingly, when the internal serine was
placed within the structural context of multiple arginine residues,
serine phosphorylation was found to be stabilizing to the coiled coil,
although notably phosphothreonine here was still destabilizing. No structural basis for the differential effects
of serine phosphorylation versus threonine phosphorylation was provided
beyond the α-helical propensity of threonine being lower than
that of serine. These effects in model peptides, with phosphorylation
generally stabilizing at the N-terminus and generally destabilizing
in the interior of an α-helix unless phosphoserine is in the
vicinity of positively charged residues, are consistent with data
for several native proteins subject to phosphorylation.,−

In contrast, relatively few data exist on the
effects of OGlcNAcylation
on structure, or on the direct comparison of the effects of phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation. In the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain repeat
(SYSPTSP), phosphorylation of serine residues induces binding to the
Pin1 WW domain as a polyproline helix, while OGlcNAcylation of Thr
induces a β-turn conformation.− In the disordered N-terminus
of the estrogen receptor, OGlcNAcylation also induces a β-turn
formation, whereas phosphorylation of the same residue opposes the
turn conformation. Within the loop region
between two α-helices of a designed α-helical hairpin,
Chan found that both phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation reduced the
rate of fibril formation, even though neither modification appreciably
affected the structure of the soluble protein or its Tm. Waters has demonstrated
in model β-hairpin peptides that phosphorylation disrupts β-hairpin
formation, whereas OGlcNAcylation at a different residue stabilizes
the β-hairpin, both via native effects of the post-translational
modifications on the β conformation and via either repulsive
(phosphorylation) or attractive (OGlcNAc) interactions with a cross-strand
tryptophan residue.−, In the only examination
of the effects of phosphorylation and glycosylation on α-helicity,
Koksch, Hackenberger, and co-workers found that phosphorylation and
glycosylation (though here β-galactose, not β-OGlcNAc;
others have found substantial structural differences between modification
with a sugar and the N-acetyl-amino sugar analogue) were destabilizing in the solvent-exposed central
sequence of a coiled coil, although a single O-galactose
could be incorporated with no effect on α-helicity.

Recently, we examined the effects of phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation
on the structure of peptides from the proline-rich domain of the protein
tau, in which hyperphosphorylation is associated with formation of
the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) observed in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and other tauopathies,
while OGlcNAcylation is protective against NFT formation.,,,, In that study, we found that, within proline-rich
sequences, phosphorylation induces polyproline helix while OGlcNAcylation
opposes polyproline helix, with the structural effects of threonine
phosphorylation being greater than those of serine phosphorylation
and the structural effects of phosphorylation being greater than those
of OGlcNAcylation., Particular conformational restriction
was observed at dianionic phosphothreonine residues, with highly restricted 3JαN coupling constants (mean 3JαN = 3.5 Hz across eight
phosphothreonine residues in six peptides; 3JαN can be corresponded to the ϕ backbone torsion
angle through a parametrized Karplus relationship) and evidence of a stable hydrogen bond between phosphothreonine
and its own amide hydrogen. Interestingly, in that study, one peptide,
tau196–209, exhibited nascent α-helical structure.
In that peptide, which contains PGSPG(S/T) repeats observed as α-helix
nucleation sites in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we found that both
phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation had similar structural effects,
with both post-translational modifications opposing α-helix
formation. These results suggest a context dependence of the structural
effects of phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation, consistent with the
observation that at some sites these modifications have opposing functional
effects whereas at other sites these modifications have similar functional
effects. Therefore, we sought to conduct a rigorous examination of
the effects of phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation of serine and threonine
on α-helicity, within a well-controlled model peptide system,
as a function of helical position, to provide a structural basis for
understanding functional effects of the major intracellular serine
and threonine post-translational modifications.

Results
A series
of peptides was synthesized on the basis of model Baldwin
α-helical peptides, Ac-(YG)AKAAAAKAAAAKAA(GY)-NH2 (Figure ), with the Tyr added for
concentration determination and located at the N-terminus (for peptides
with C-terminal modifications) or C-terminus (all other peptides)
as appropriate to avoid interactions with the sites of modification.
Serine and threonine residues were introduced at the N-terminal amino
acid (residue 1) (Ac-XKAAAAKAAAAKAAGY-NH2), at an internal amino acid (residue 5) (Ac-AKAAXAKAAAAKAAGY-NH2), and at the C-terminal amino acid (residue 14, counting
from the first Ala to employ consistent numbering across all peptides)
(Ac-YGAKAAAAKAAAAKAX-NH2) to examine the effects of post-translational
modifications at the N-terminus, in the interior, and at the C-terminus
of an α-helix (Figure ). All positions
were chosen to avoid potential i, i + 4 interactions with lysine residues. Peptides with serine, phosphoserine, threonine, and phosphothreonine
residues were synthesized via trityl-protected serine and threonine,
followed by trityl deprotection, phosphitylation, oxidation, and peptide
cleavage/deprotection, yielding the peptides with site-specifically
phosphorylated amino acids., OGlcNAcylated peptides
were synthesized using the protected Fmoc-Ser/Thr-(Ac3OGlcNAc)-OH,
synthesized via a modification of the method of Arsequell, followed
by initial peptide purification, O-deacetylation, and final peptide
purification, yielding peptides site-specifically incorporating a
single Ser or Thr OGlcNAc.,, All peptides were examined by circular dichroism at 0.5 °C
(Figures – and Table ). Peptides were also examined
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine residue-specific
structural changes (Tables  and  and ).,

Sequences
of peptides examined in this study. Top: the alanine-rich
model α-helical peptide. Middle: peptides with modifications
at the N-terminal residue (residue 1), at a central residue (residue
5), and at the C-terminal residue (residue 14; numbering based on
other peptides, using the first Ala as residue 1, excluding the N-terminal
YG) of a model α-helix. GY or YG sequences were added for concentration
determination. The peptide with the C-terminal modifications employed
the YG at the N-terminus to avoid potential interaction of the post-translational
modification with the tyrosine. Bottom: peptides examined for the
effects of phosphorylation at residues 2 and 10. Peptides were also
synthesized with proline in place of serine or threonine at residues
1, 2, 5, 10, and 14.

where [θ]C is the mean residue ellipticity at 222
nm of 100% random coil, which equals 2220 – 53T, [θ]H is the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm
of 100% α-helix, which equals (−44000 + 250T)/(1 – 3/n), where T is
the temperature in degrees Celsius (0.5) and n is
the number of residues (16).

Experiments were
conducted in 5
mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) with 25 mM NaCl in D2O (unless
otherwise indicated). The peptide Ac-ASer(OPO32–)AAAAKAAAAKAAGY-NH2 exhibited a 3JPHβ of 7.4 Hz (with identical coupling to both diastereotopic serine
Hβ protons) at 278 K and a 3JPHβ of 6.7 Hz at 298 K (Figure S93 of the ).

Peptides with an N-terminal serine residue all exhibited
α-helicity
comparable to or greater than that of alanine (Figure ), consistent with the known ability of serine to function
as an N-cap via hydrogen bonding of the serine lone pair electrons
with unsatisfied amide hydrogens.,− Notably, phosphoserine and serine-O-GlcNAc have multiple hydrogen
bond acceptor lone pairs, suggesting their capability to function
similarly. Phosphoserine may also contribute to stability at the N-terminus
of an α-helix via favorable helix dipole interactions.,,, Interestingly, Ser-OGlcNAc exhibited α-helicity comparable
to that of Ser but had a substantially more α-helical 3JαN coupling constant, which correlates
with the ϕ torsion angle (here, 3JαN = 3.3 Hz for SerOGlcNAc, corresponding to ϕ
= −53°, compared to 3JαN = 5.1 Hz, average ϕ = −68°, for
Ser, as expected for a peptide that is 50% α-helical and 50%
random coil), suggesting substantial conformational restriction is
involved in the N-terminal helix-stabilizing effects of Ser-OGlcNAc.
The magnitude of this coupling constant in Ser-OGlcNAc strongly suggests
a conformationally restricting interaction that is present in both
the α-helical and random coil states.

As has been previously
observed, a dianionic N-terminal phosphoserine
is more α-helix-stabilizing than the monoanionic phosphoserine
(typical pKa of ∼5.8). The increased α-helicity for the phosphoserine
dianion could be due to a more favorable helix–dipole interaction,
better oxygen hydrogen bond acceptors in N-capping due to a greater
negative charge per oxygen, and/or greater conformational restriction
of dianionic phosphoserine than serine or monoanionic phosphoserine.
NMR of the phosphoserine residue (Table  and ) indicates a highly downfield-shifted
phosphoserine amide proton chemical shift, which has previously been
observed by us and others for dianionic phosphoserine and phosphothreonine,
and is consistent with a hydrogen bonding interaction of phosphoserine
with its own amide hydrogen.,,,,− The dianionic phosphoserine also exhibited greater ϕ conformational
restriction than the monoanionic phosphoserine [3JαN = 3.6 Hz (average ϕ = −56°)
and 4.4 Hz (average ϕ = −62°), respectively]. We
have also observed in polyproline helices, which lack both secondary
structure interactions with hydrogen bond donors and an appreciable
helix dipole, that the dianionic phosphorylated residues induce a
greater structural change than monoanionic phosphates, both by CD
and by NMR., These data suggest a role for
conformational restriction due to phosphorylation, in addition to
the electrostatic effects and hydrogen bonding effects of phosphorylation,
in inducing structural change.

The peptide with an N-terminal
threonine residue was less α-helical
than the peptide with Ser or Ala at the N-terminus, consistent with
previous data on α-helix propensities in general and at the
N-terminus in particular (Figures  and  and Table ).,,,− OGlcNAcylation of threonine resulted in a significant increase in
α-helicity, generating a peptide with α-helicity comparable
to that of the Ala peptide. As was observed for serine, threonine
phosphorylation resulted in an increase in α-helicity, with
greater α-helicity for the dianionic state than the monoanionic
state. For both OGlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, a higher level
of induced structure and a greater overall structural change were
observed for threonine modification than for serine modification:
of all peptides in the series with N-terminal modifications, the least
α-helical peptide contained unmodified threonine while the most
α-helical peptide contained dianionic phosphothreonine. NMR
confirmed CD data (Table  and ): unmodified threonine
was more disordered than serine, whereas phosphothreonine was highly
ordered, with an overall change in ϕ (3JαN = 3.5 Hz for ThrOPO32–, corresponding to an average ϕ = −55°, compared
to 3JαN = 6.2 Hz for
Thr, corresponding to an average ϕ = −76°; overall
Δ3JαN = 2.7 Hz)
larger than the change for Ser (Δ3JαN = 1.5 Hz). Dianionic
phosphothreonine also induced greater amide chemical shift dispersion
than any other peptide with N-terminal Ser and/or Thr residues. Interestingly,
while the peptide with ThrOGlcNAc had greater induced α-helicity
than that with SerOGlcNAc by CD, greater ϕ main chain conformational
restriction was observed for SerOGlcNAc by NMR, suggesting additional
conformational restriction induced by the sugar.

Doig observed that the largest
structural effects of serine phosphorylation
were at the second residue of α-helical peptides. We found that the effects of serine and threonine
phosphorylation were also magnified at this position, with dianionic
phosphothreonine at residue 2 generating the most α-helical
peptide in this study (Figure ). By NMR, both
phosphopeptides also exhibited highly restricted backbone conformations
at the phosphorylated residue [3JαN values of 4.3 Hz (pSer) and 3.7 Hz (pThr) as dianionic
phosphates] compared to those of the nonphosphorylated peptides (Table ). The phosphothreonine amide hydrogen exhibited
a particularly downfield chemical shift (δ = 10.24 ppm, compared
to δ = 8.63 ppm for nonphosphorylated Thr) as well as exchange
dynamics (including reduced peak magnitude) that were different from
those of any amide in this study, consistent with an especially favorable
interaction with this amide in this peptide. In addition, NMR data
indicated particular χ1 conformational restriction
for phosphothreonine in this peptide, with a 3JHαHβ of 10.4 Hz, which corresponds, to phosphothreonine adopting almost exclusively a χ1 = −60° torsion angle (g– or m) (Figure S25 of the ). Dianionic phosphothreonine
at residue 2 also induced two of the four most downfield resonances
of alanine amide protons (δ = 8.97 and 8.72 ppm) of any peptides
in this study, with an alanine in the peptides with phosphothreonine
at residue 5 (δ = 8.82 ppm) and at residue 10 (δ = 8.80
ppm) being the others (see the  for complete NMR data), suggestive of strong local stabilizing interactions
induced by phosphothreonine. These structural effects correlated with
α-helical structure: with increased temperature, which resulted
in reduced α-helical content [CD (Figure S16 of the )], the phosphothreonine
amide chemical shift became more upfield and the 3JαN increased, as was observed for other,
less α-helical peptides in this study.

(pH 4) (open magenta circles). CD experiments were conducted in water

The effects of serine post-translational
modifications were examined
in the interior of the α-helix at residue 5 (Figure ). As described previously by Vinson and by Doig,, phosphorylation of serine here was significantly destabilizing with
respect to α-helicity, with the destabilizing effect of phosphorylation
being larger than the stabilizing effect observed at the N-terminus.
Interestingly, despite the lower α-helicity observed by CD,
the dianionic phosphoserine by NMR still exhibited an α-helical 3JαN (4.5 Hz) and a more
restricted 3JαN than
monoanionic phosphoserine (5.7 Hz), suggestive of a strong local stabilizing
interaction. Serine OGlcNAcylation also destabilized the α-helix,
though to an extent smaller than that observed for phosphorylation.

Threonine is more α-helix-destabilizing
than serine. Both
residues are helix-destabilizing because of the combination of side
chain hydrogen bond donors and acceptors capable of multiple hydrogen
bonds with the main chain, with Thr being additionally destabilizing
because of the greater steric demand of a β-branched amino acid.,,, Thus, as expected, the peptide with an interior threonine (residue
5) was substantially less α-helical (Figure ) than the peptide with serine (Figure ), and both peptides were less α-helical than the peptide with
alanine here (Figure  and Table ). Both post-translational modifications exacerbated the low
α-helical propensity of threonine. In this case, in contrast
to all previous results and all other results herein, the dianionic
phosphothreonine was less structurally modifying (here, less destabilizing
to the α-helix) than the monoanionic phosphothreonine. This
reduced α-helical disruption could be due to the combination
of α-helix-destabilizing effects of phosphothreonine being partially
counteracted by the ability of phosphothreonine to more effectively
nucleate the shorter C-terminal α-helix (e.g., in residues 5–14,
with strong α-helix nucleation by phosphothreonine at the N-terminus
of the short α-helix, as seen above). Consistent with this interpretation,
by NMR, phosphothreonine at residue 5 exhibited a quite downfield
amide chemical shift (δ = 9.50 ppm) and a small 3JαN of 4.1 Hz consistent with α-helix.
Alternatively, the increased α-helicity of dianionic versus
monoanionic phosphothreonine here could potentially be due to a favorable
interaction with the i – 3 lysine residue,
though this interaction is expected to contribute minimally and was
not apparently significant for phosphoserine at this position. Here, the most disruptive post-translational
modification was Thr OGlcNAcylation, which rendered the peptide almost
fully random coil. ThrOGlcNAc is a highly sterically demanding amino
acid, which in general leads to a bias against α-helix and polyproline
helix and a greater preference for more extended conformations, as
has been observed for other sterically demanding amino acids such
as tert-leucine, fluorinated amino acids, and non-Aib
α,α-dialkylglycines.,,,−

phosphate (pH 7 or as indicated) and 25 mM KF at 0.5 °C.

To examine the basis for the unexpected
reduced structural effects
of dianionic versus monoanionic phosphothreonine at residue 5 of the
α-helix, peptides were synthesized with threonine or phosphothreonine
at residue 10 of the α-helix (Figures  and ). Peptides were also synthesized with
serine or phosphoserine here, to determine whether there is an inherent
effect of α-helical position on the structural effects of phosphorylation
(Figure ). The unmodified Thr-containing peptides
(Thr at residue 5 or 10) had similar α-helicities, indicating
that there is no inherent difference in the effects of threonine at
different interior residues of the α-helix, as expected on the
basis of previous data on helix propensities as a function of α-helical
position., In contrast, at residue 10, phosphothreonine
was highly disruptive to the α-helix, with the dianionic phosphothreonine
inducing a complete random coil CD spectrum of the peptide, and the
monoanionic phosphothreonine also inducing disruption of the α-helix
greater than that observed by any modification at residue 5 of the
α-helix. Similarly, phosphoserine was also highly disruptive
to the α-helix at residue 10, with a greater disruption of the
α-helix by phosphoserine at residue 10 than at residue 5 and
with a greater disruption as dianionic phosphoserine than as monoanionic
phosphoserine. Interestingly, by NMR, phosphothreonine and phosphoserine
still exhibited significantly downfield chemical shifts (δ =
9.41 and 9.01 ppm, respectively) and small 3JαN values (4.5 and 3.3 Hz, respectively) indicative
of restricted ϕ (corresponding to average ϕ values of
−63° and −53°, respectively), consistent with α-helix formation but also observed
in proline-rich peptides adopting a polyproline helix., In addition, the peptide with dianionic phosphothreonine also exhibited
the greatest chemical shift dispersion of the alanine amide protons
(σ = 0.43 ppm, compared to σ = 0.32 ppm for the peptide
with dianionic phosphothreonine at residue 2 and σ = 0.08–0.19
ppm for all other Thr-containing peptides), with two significantly
upfield alanine amide resonances (δ = 8.80 and 8.61 ppm), suggestive
of substantial local structure around phosphothreonine despite an
overall random coil structure. These data are consistent with the
interpretation that the structural effects of threonine phosphorylation
at residue 5 are a balance of disruption of α-helical structure
of the residues N-terminal to phosphothreonine via a phosphate–amide
interaction, versus a significant induction of a shorter α-helix
for the C-terminal residues (e.g., residues 5–14, as was observed
at position 1 or 2 of an α-helix). In contrast, at residue 10,
the effects of phosphorylation on α-helical induction are inherently
minimal because only four residues are C-terminal (one α-helical
turn; in general, very short α-helices are inherently unstable), while exhibiting a strong anti-α-helix
signal due to the phosphate–amide interaction disrupting the
hydrogen bonding pattern necessary for α-helix propagation.
More generally, these data indicate that phosphorylation in the interior
of an α-helix is more disruptive when the phosphorylation site
is closer to the C-terminus. Most broadly, these data indicate a particularly
strong disruption of the α-helix by phosphothreonine when in
the interior of an α-helix, comparable to the effects of proline
within α-helices.,−

The effects of serine and threonine post-translational
modifications
were examined at the C-terminus of the α-helix (Figure ). There has been no prior measurement of the effects
of phosphorylation at the C-terminus of an α-helix, although
Doig noted that molecular dynamics simulations, which can underestimate
hydrogen bonding and n → π* noncovalent interactions
and overestimate electrostatic interactions, suggested strong disruption
of the α-helix. Serine and threonine
exhibit enhanced frequencies and α-helical propensities at the
C-termini of α-helices because of their ability to function
effectively as C-caps via their hydrogen bond donor capabilities in
bonding to exposed amide carbonyls.,,,,− In contrast, in α-helices, the helix macrodipole is stabilized
by positively charged residues at the C-terminus and destabilized
here by negatively charged residues.,, The data indicate that both serine and threonine
exhibit enhanced α-helical propensity at the C-terminus relative
to interior positions, with somewhat greater α-helicity for
serine than for threonine, as expected. In contrast, both OGlcNAcylation
and phosphorylation disrupted the α-helix at the C-terminus
of α-helices, with greater α-helical disruption upon phosphorylation
than OGlcNAcylation. Interestingly, by NMR, dianionic phosphoserine
and phosphothreonine exhibited substantially larger 3JαN values (6.3 and 6.2 Hz, respectively)
and more upfield amide chemical shifts (Table ) than in any other phosphopeptides in this study or in proline-rich
peptides examined previously, suggesting a weakening of the phosphate–amide
interaction, potentially due to either an unfavorable α-helix
macrodipole or the importance of amide hydrogen bonding to the i – 4 carbonyl in α-helices, which competes
with the amide–phosphate interaction. Interestingly, the C-terminal
carboxamide chemical shifts for the peptides with ThrOGlcNAc (δ
= 7.50 and 7.39 ppm) and ThrOPO32– (δ
= 7.89 and 7.25 ppm) were divergent from those of any other peptides
in this study [7.63–7.70 and 7.22–7.25 ppm (7.30–7.35
ppm for C-terminal modifications)] (Tables S30 and S40 of the ). Notably, while both
post-translational modifications were disruptive at the interior and
at the C-terminus of α-helices, for threonine the effects of
phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation were observed to be greater at
the interior of α-helices than at the C-terminus, whereas for
serine the effects were comparable in both locations (Figures  and ). These differences may potentially be due to the less favorable
phosphate–amide interactions for phosphoserine than for phosphothreonine
(e.g., as observed in smaller downfield amide chemical shifts for
phosphoserine in all peptides).

at residue 10, and blue those at residue 14. Each plot in this figure
includes the CD data of a series of isomeric peptides (N1, N5, N10,
and N14).

Interestingly, the effects of
post-translational modifications
described above are qualitatively similar to those that are expected
for proline residues. N-Terminal proline residues nucleate the α-helix
via conformational restriction and effective presentation of the carbonyl
hydrogen bond acceptors for i + 4 amide protons.
Internal proline residues strongly disrupt α-helices, and C-terminal
proline residues serve as α-helix stop signals, as a result
of proline preventing propagation of the hydrogen bonding pattern
of an α-helix due to the absence of an amide hydrogen, as well
as a steric clash between proline and the prior amino acid when both
are in α-helical conformations.,,,− To directly compare the effects of serine and threonine post-translational
modifications with those of proline, peptides were synthesized with
proline at residues 1, 2, 5, 10, and 14 of the model peptides (Figure ). As expected, peptides with proline at the N-terminus
(residue 1 or 2) exhibited substantial α-helix, though the level
was lower than that observed for peptides with N-terminal serine or
threonine derivatives (Figure a)., In contrast, internal proline residues (position 5 or 10) strongly
disrupted the α-helix, resulting in a random coil CD signature,
similar to those observed for Thr(OGlcNAc) at residue 5 or for phosphothreonine
or phosphoserine at residue 10 (Figure b).
C-Terminal proline residues modestly disrupted α-helicity, in
a manner similar to the effects of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine
at these positions (Figure c). Overall, proline
substantially modulated α-helicity in this series of peptides
as a function of position, as expected (Figure d).

Phosphorylation of threonine at residue 2 and at
residue 10 produced
the greatest structural effects of any peptides in this study: phosphothreonine
at residue 2 yielded the most α-helical peptide herein, while
phosphothreonine at residue 10 yielded the peptide with the least
α-helical content, with the peptide exhibiting a complete random
coil signature. Peptides with threonine or phosphothreonine at residue
2 or 10 were examined further by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, using 1H–13C HSQC experiments, to identify the
residue-specific effects of modification in these peptides (Figure ; expanded spectra in Figures S90 and S91 of the  and Tables S23 and S24
of the ). By chemical
shift index analysis, upfield changes in the Hα chemical shift,
downfield changes in the Cα chemical shift, and upfield changes
in the Cβ chemical shift are indicative of increased α-helical
content at a given residue., These experiments indicated
that the structural effects observed by circular dichroism were consistent
with structural changes throughout the peptides, with phosphorylation
making alanine and lysine residues more α-helical (i.e., southeastern
movement of resonances in Figure a) in the
peptide with phosphothreonine at residue 2 but making alanine and
lysine residues less α-helical upon phosphorylation at residue
10 (i.e., northwestern movement of resonances in Figure b). The mean chemical shift of alanine Cα
resonances was 51.39 ppm for the peptide with phosphothreonine at
residue 2 (Δδ = +0.65 ppm upon phosphorylation), versus
49.33 ppm for the peptide with phosphothreonine at residue 10 (Δδ
= −0.74 ppm upon phosphorylation), indicating significant overall
differences in induced structure upon phosphorylation as a function
of location within the α-helix (Table S45 of the ). Of additional note is
the difference in phosphorylation-induced changes in the Hα
and 13Cα chemical shifts of threonine, which exhibited
0.24 ppm upfield and 3.41 ppm downfield changes, respectively, upon
phosphorylation at residue 2, but 0.16 ppm upfield and 0.61 ppm downfield
changes, respectively, upon phosphorylation at residue 10. Overall,
the phosphothreonine 13Cα chemical shift at residue
2 was 2.89 ppm downfield of that at residue 10, despite almost no
difference (0.09 ppm) in the 13Cα threonine chemical
shift in the nonphosphorylated peptides, consistent with the large
difference in α-helicity of the two phosphorylated peptides.
The effects of phosphorylation on the Hβ, Cβ, and Cγ
Thr resonances were also substantially dependent on structural context,
as were the effects on Hα, Hβ, and Cβ resonances
of Ala and Lys residues [see the  for quantitative comparisons of NMR data for threonine-containing
peptides (Tables S34–S46) and serine-containing peptides (Tables
S25–S33)].

1H–13C HSQC spectra (Hα–Cα
region) of peptides with nonphosphorylated (green) and phosphorylated
(red) threonine. Experiments were conducted at 278 K in D2O containing 5 mM phosphate (pH 4 for nonphosphorylated peptides
and pH 8 for phosphorylated peptides) and 25 mM NaCl. Full spectra
are given in the . (a) Peptides with threonine or phosphothreonine at residue 2. (b)
Peptides with threonine or phosphothreonine at residue 10.

The effects of serine/threonine post-translational
modifications
on α-helicity could also be read out across all serine/threonine-containing
peptides via analysis of the chemical shift of the N-terminal acetyl
group, which reports on the structure at the N-terminus of the peptide
(Table  and Tables S29 and S39 of the ). The most α-helical
peptides exhibited the most downfield acetyl chemical shifts, with
N-terminal phosphorylation inducing further downfield shifts. In contrast,
the least α-helical peptides exhibited more upfield acetyl chemical
shifts.

To confirm the reversible structural effects of phosphorylation,
the peptides with phosphothreonine at residue 2 and phosphothreonine
at residue 10 were incubated with Antarctic phosphatase, a nonspecific
phosphatase. The peptide with phosphothreonine at residue 2 exhibited
a reduced α-helical content as a function of time upon exposure
to phosphatase, while the peptide with phosphothreonine at residue
10 exhibited a change from a random coil signature to α-helix
upon desphosphorylation by phosphatase, in a manner consistent with
the effects observed in isolated peptides (Figures S17–S20
of the ). In general,
phosphatases act preferentially on random coil structures. Interestingly,
despite the random coil overall structure of the peptide with phosphothreonine
at residue 10, this peptide exhibited relatively slower dephosphorylation,
consistent with local structure around phosphothreonine potentially
sterically reducing access to the substrate. Collectively, these results
emphasize that reversible phosphorylation may function as a trigger
to induce or disrupt α-helix, depending on the position of the
phosphorylation site within an α-helix.

We have previously
identified that phosphothreonine may adopt a
highly conformationally restricted structure, in which the Cβ–Hβ bond is, surprisingly, in an eclipsed
or near-eclipsed conformation with the Oγ–P
bond. On the basis of a parametrized
Karplus relationship for P–H three-bond coupling constants,
the expected 3JHβP for
an eclipsing interaction is 10.6 Hz. All
phosphothreonine-containing peptides were analyzed by 31P NMR (Table ). Peptides with greater α-helicity
or conditions that strongly promote α-helix formation [lower
temperature and/or addition of trifluoroethanol (TFE)] were observed
to have larger (more conformationally restricted) 3JHβP values, close to that expected for
an eclipsed C–H/O–P bond (maximum observed 3JHβP of 9.6 Hz), while peptides
or conditions (higher temperature) that exhibited lower α-helical
content by CD were observed to have smaller 3JHβP values, consistent with more disordered conformations
(minimum observed 3JHβP of 7.8 Hz, which still represents only a 30° average deviation
from an eclipsed conformation). Notably, even under conditions where
the peptide is disordered, the 3JHβP for phosphothreonine residues was larger than has
been normally observed for phosphoserine residues (typically 3JHβP ∼ 6 Hz for each
of the diastereotopic β protons), as has been seen previously
for phosphothreonine in other peptides and proteins, suggestive of
inherently substantially greater conformational restriction at the
individual amino acid side chain level for phosphothreonine than phosphoserine.−

Discussion
We have described the direct comparison of the
effects of two competing
intracellular post-translational modifications, phosphorylation and
OGlcNAcylation, on the stability of the α-helix, the most common
secondary structure in proteins, examining separately the effects
of serine and threonine modification and the effects of modifications
at the N-terminus, at internal positions, and at the C-terminus of
the α-helix. Within α-helices, we found the effects of
phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation to be qualitatively similar, though
differing in magnitude, with effects of phosphorylation in most cases
being greater than those of OGlcNAcylation. At the N-terminus of the
α-helix, both post-translational modifications were stabilizing,
with phosphorylation in the more physiologically important dianionic
state the most stabilizing. In addition, we found greater induced
α-helicity with phosphothreonine than phosphoserine. Notably,
all post-translational modifications at the N-terminus (residue 1
or 2) generated peptides that were more α-helical than peptides
with alanine, the most helix-stabilizing canonical residue. In contrast,
at a position in the interior of an α-helix, both post-translational
modifications were destabilizing, with particular α-helix destabilization
for post-translationally modified threonine residues. Both threonine
OGlcNAcylation and threonine phosphorylation were capable of nearly
complete disruption of the α-helix, in a manner dependent on
position in the α-helix, with phosphothreonine effects representing
a balance of strong helix-inducing effects at the N-terminus of an
α-helix and strong helix-disrupting effects in the interior
of an α-helix. Phosphorylation was more disruptive to the α-helix
at a more C-terminal interior position (residue 10) than at a more
N-terminal interior position (residue 5) of the α-helix. The
data on phosphorylation at the N-terminus and interior of α-helices
are consistent with previous data for phosphorylation in model peptides
and in coiled coils, although larger effects were observed in coiled
coils, potentially because of the roles of tertiary structure, additional
side chain–side chain interactions, and multiple modifications
(two to four phosphorylated residues) in these contexts.,, Most previous studies examined
only serine phosphorylation, although Vinson observed severe effects
of threonine phosphorylation on coiled coil stability.

This work represents the first direct
comparison of the effects
of phosphorylation versus OGlcNAcylation within the context of an
α-helix. These data suggest α-helices as one context in
which phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation may have similar structural
and, potentially, functional effects, the latter of which are observed
in some cases of these post-translational modifications., Both post-translational modifications are stabilizing at the N-terminus
of an α-helix but are destabilizing at the interior or at the
C-terminus of an α-helix, effects that enhance the native α-helix
propensities of serine and threonine. The contrasting effects of these
post-translational modifications at the N-terminus (induce α-helix)
versus the interior or C-terminus (disrupt α-helix) of an α-helix
suggest that both OGlcNAcylation and phosphorylation enhance α-helical
start and stop signals in proteins, defining the boundaries of α-helical
structure and recognition epitopes., Given the
general observation of OGlcNAcylation and phosphorylation in transcriptional
regulatory elements and the broad importance of α-helical recognition
epitopes in transcription, these data suggest the possibility of direct
structural effects of both post-translational modifications on transcription,
via both induction and disruption of recognition α-helices.,,,−

The results herein in α-helices stand in contrast to
the
results of our previous investigation of the effects of phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation on the structure of the proline-rich domain of
tau and of proline-rich model peptides. In these proline-rich contexts,
the post-translational modifications had opposing structural effects,
with phosphorylation inducing polyproline helix formation and OGlcNAcylation
confirming the native biases of serine and threonine and opposing
polyproline helix.,, The effects of OGlcNAcylation in disfavoring formation of both the
polyproline helix and the α-helix at the interior of an α-helix,
and with greater induced effects observed in the more compact structure
of an α-helix compared to the somewhat more extended polyproline
helix, are consistent with the effects of OGlcNAcylation being significantly
steric in nature. The role of the OGlcNAc in stabilizing the N-terminus
of an α-helix is less clear. The effect could be due to overall
conformational restriction, in the presence of reduced steric restraints
at the N-terminus of the α-helix. Alternatively, the sugar notably
adds several additional hydrogen bond acceptors, which could potentially
function in helix capping. In contrast to OGlcNAcylation, the effects
of phosphorylation appear to be primarily mediated through the interaction
of the phosphate with the amide backbone (see below), with additional
effects due to α-helix macrodipole interactions (for anions,
favorable at the N-terminus and unfavorable at the C-terminus). In
total, these data emphasize the importance of structural context when
considering the effects of protein post-translational modifications
and provide a basis for understanding situations in which phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation may be opposing (e.g., yin-yang) versus complementary
in their effects, both of which have been described in numerous biological
contexts.,,,,,

We previously observed in proline-rich peptides that the structural
effects of threonine modification were greater than those of serine
modification, with a highly conformationally restricted structure
observed for phosphothreonine, including restriction of ϕ to
a conformation compatible with either α-helix or polyproline
helix (mean 3JαN = 3.5
Hz for dianionic pThr, versus mean 3JαN = 5.4 Hz for dianionic pSer) and evidence of a phosphate–amide
side chain–main chain hydrogen bond, via highly downfield amide
H chemical shifts (mean δ = 9.63 ppm for pThr, and mean δ
= 8.99 ppm for pSer) and slow amide exchange at the phosphorylated
residues at pH 8, even at high salt concentrations (1 M NaCl) and
elevated temperatures.,,, Both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine
exhibited conformations distinct from expected random coil values
(3JαN ∼ 6–8
Hz) observed for nonphosphorylated residues in multiple proline-rich
peptide contexts, and in particular, phosphothreonine and phosphoserine
had greater conformational restriction than the standard phosphomimic
Glu (Glu 3JαN = 5.8–6.3
Hz). Notably, the side chain–main chain hydrogen bonding previously
observed, by us and others, would be highly disruptive within α-helices.,− Vinson previously observed in coiled coil peptides that threonine
phosphorylation was particularly structurally disruptive to α-helices,
compared to serine phosphorylation., Similarly,
Hilser observed larger effects of threonine over serine phosphorylation
in model polyproline helix-mediated protein–protein interactions. In addition, Corzana et al. have observed greater
conformational restriction in ThrOGlcNAc over SerOGlcNAc amino acids,
as well as more generally in glycosylated threonine over glycosylated
serine amino acids.,,− The data herein are consistent with all
of these observations, with structural effects of threonine phosphorylation
and threonine OGlcNAcylation observed herein greater than those of
the same post-translational modifications on serine. In particular,
the significant conformational restriction at phosphothreonine, combined
with larger induced structural effects seen by CD and by NMR, suggests
a special role for phosphothreonine residues in protein structure.
Collectively, these data from multiple structural contexts suggest
threonine residues as potential hot spots in structural modulation
via protein post-translational modifications compared to serine residues,
with larger induced effects for threonine modification than serine
modification.,

Notably, the effects of
serine and (particularly) threonine modification
by OGlcNAcylation and (particularly) phosphorylation are similar to
those observed for proline residues on α-helices. Proline is
an α-helix inducer at the N-terminus of α-helices, because
of the conformational restriction of its ϕ torsion angle to
one similar to that in α-helices and its ready presentation
of its carbonyl as a hydrogen bond acceptor to interact with i + 4 amide hydrogens and thus nucleate the first turn of
the α-helix.−,,− In contrast, proline is widely recognized as being highly disruptive
to α-helices in their central residues, primarily due to proline’s
inability to propagate hydrogen bonding patterns of α-helices
because of the absence of an amide hydrogen bond donor.,,,,,,,, Interestingly, the kinks induced in α-helices with central
proline residues can cause these exposed hydrogen bonding groups to
be potent sites for protein–protein interactions in membranes.,,− Proline residues are also destabilizing at the C-terminus of α-helices,
again because of the absence of a hydrogen bond donor, as well as
a preference for a non-α-helical conformation in the pre-proline
residue, which can cause fraying and distortions of the last turn
of the α-helix or alternatively adoption of nonhelical conformations
at proline.,,,,,,,, The effects of proline disruption
of α-helices are reduced at the C-terminus compared to in the
interior of the α-helix, with greater interior effects closer
to the C-terminus than to the N-terminus, as was observed here for
phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation. We
previously observed that phosphothreonine is a particularly conformationally
restricted amino acid, capable of adopting a structure similar to
that of proline via two noncovalent interactions: (1) side chain cyclization
via side chain–main chain phosphate–amide hydrogen bonding
and (2) an n → π* interaction between consecutive carbonyls. Because of its dramatic structural effects,
proline is widely recognized as a start and stop signal for α-helices.,,− Notably, the
structural effects of threonine phosphorylation on α-helix stability
were found herein to be greater than those of proline, and the effects
of threonine OGlcNAcylation were found to be comparable to those of
proline (Figures b,c and ). The data herein suggest phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation
can function like proline, but as inducible start and stop signals
in α-helices, with induction of the α-helix at the N-terminus
and disruption of the α-helix in the interior and at the C-terminus
of α-helices.

At the N-terminus of peptides, both phosphoserine
and phosphothreonine
strongly promoted α-helix, with phosphorylation inducing α-helicity
greater than that observed in peptides containing alanine. In addition,
greater induced α-helicity was observed for phosphothreonine
at residue 2 than at residue 1. Analysis of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine
residues in α-helices in high-resolution structures in the PDB
(structures at ≤2.4 Å, 90% sequence identity cutoff) indicated
a strong preference for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine to be at
or near the helical N-terminus when they were present in α-helices
(pSer: 1h4x, 2fwn, 3mk1, 3ql6, 2w5w, 2bik, 3f3z, 1mki, and 3qic; pThr: 3ot9, 4iza, 2ga3, 2jfl, 2w8d, 2wtv, and 3u02; PDB entry 1r0z was the only example
among these structures in which an α-helical phosphorylated
residue was outside the first turn of the α-helix). In a majority
of these examples, the phosphorylated residue was the first α-helical
residue. These structures revealed a common structural motif in which
multiple noncovalent interactions centered on phosphorylation lead
to stabilization of the α-helix (Figure ).− The phosphate interacts with its own amide
hydrogen (residue i) via hydrogen bonding. The i – 1 carbonyl, conjugated to the phosphoresidue
amide, engages in an n → π* interaction with the i (phosphorylated) residue carbonyl (an interaction expected
to be strengthened due to the amide–phosphate hydrogen bond,
generating a better donor carbonyl group at the i – 1 residue, as is done by thioamide donors, and a better
hydrogen bond acceptor at the i residue due to the
n → π* interaction,). The i – 1 and i carbonyls hydrogen bond
with the i + 3 and i + 4 amide hydrogens.
In addition, in some cases (e.g., PDB entry 3ql6), the i – 1 carbonyl also interacts with the i +
1 amide in a bidentate hydrogen bond and the i –
2 carbonyl engages in a hydrogen bond with the i +
2 amide hydrogen. In these structures, the phosphate group interacts
with only its own amide hydrogen and does not directly interact with
the subsequent amides. One exception is PDB entry 2wtv, which contains
two consecutive phosphothreonine residues, one at the N-cap position
(which exhibits i – 1···i + 1 and i – 1···i + 2 phosphate–amide hydrogen bonds) and one at
the N-terminus of the α-helix (which interacts with its own
amide hydrogen but does not interact with other helical residues).

resolution, residues 196–205; (b) PDB entry 1h4x,Bacillus subtilis sporulation factor SpoIIAB,
1.16 Å resolution, residues 56–71] and (c) phosphothreonine
(right, pdb 2w8d,B. subtilis lipoteichoic acid synthase, 2.35 Å resolution, residues 295–305)
residues at the N-terminus of the α-helix. The lactoperoxidase
structure (a) also includes an Asn-linked β-OGlcNAc two residues
C-terminal to the α-helix (residue 205, with residues 204 and
205 in extended conformations). Hydrogen bonds are denoted with black
dashed lines; n → π* interactions (here, Oi–1–Ci=Oi distances of 2.85–2.90 Å and
Oi–1–Ci=Oi angles of 88–115°)
are denoted with magenta dashed lines.

These structures suggest a general mode by which phosphorylation
stabilizes α-helices when it occurs at the N-terminus: in addition
to a favorable interaction of the dianionic phosphate with the α-helix
macrodipole,, an interaction that would be
maximized by the phosphate being located directly adjacent to the
peptide backbone, phosphorylation promotes a strong phosphate–amide
hydrogen bond with its own amide hydrogen; this entropically favorable
intraresidue phosphate–amide interaction structurally organizes
the prior residue (e.g., as in pre-proline effects) and aligns both
the i – 1 and i carbonyls
via n → π* interactions (favorable in α-helices)− to effectively hydrogen bond with the i + 3 and i + 4 amide hydrogens. This interaction also may promote
interactions of the i – 1 and/or i – 2 carbonyl with the i + 1 and/or i + 2 amide hydrogens, potentially providing hydrogen bond
acceptors for all α-helical amide groups and suggesting a plausible
structural basis for the observation of the α-helicity for phosphorylated
residues at the N2 position being greater than that at the N1 position
of alanine-rich peptides. This observation also correlates with observed
downfield N-terminal acetyl chemical shifts for N1 and N2 phosphopeptides
compared to other phosphopeptides (Table ).
The strength of this network of noncovalent interactions also explains
the observation that the peptide with the N5 phosphothreonine is more
α-helical as a dianion than a monoanion, because of strong helix-inducing
effects (e.g., organizing residue 4, and possibly residue 3) at the
N-terminus of the shorter α-helix in this case counteracting
the strong helix-destabilizing effects of phosphothreonine in the
interior of an α-helix.

Serine/threonine phosphorylation
is the most prominent reversible
intracellular post-translational modification, with phosphorylation
observed on a majority of proteins involved in signal transduction
and transcription. OGlcNAcylation has also been observed on numerous
intracellular proteins that are important in signal transduction and
transcription, often on sites that have also been identified as phosphorylation
sites. Because of a reduced number of tools for the examination of
OGlcNAcylation compared to the number for phosphorylation, including
in particular a limited repertoire of antibodies, the absence of convenient
radiolabeling methods, and more challenging synthetic methods, the
effects of OGlcNAcylation on protein structure and function are substantially
less well understood.,− Even greater challenges exist for the more complex glycosylation
events observed extracellularly, which are employed in cell–cell
communication and cell recognition and are modulated in several diseases,
including cancers, inflammatory diseases, and bacterial and viral
infections.− This work examined the effects of β-OGlcNAc modification on
α-helical peptides. Notably, these effects are expected to be
general for OGlcNAcylation but are not expected to be general for
all serine/threonine glycosylation events nor for N-linked glycosylation.,− In particular, the effects of β-OGlcNAc modification might
be quite different from the effects of modification with α anomers
of sugars, which is common in extracellular proteins. Indeed, in a
limited number of examples, including antifreeze proteins and the
prion protein, dramatic structural differences were observed between
modification of Ser/Thr residues with α anomers versus β
anomers of sugars.,, Data to date suggest that β anomers exhibit substantial steric
effects near the backbone, similar to β-branched and aromatic
amino acids, whereas α anomers are more compatible with compact
protein conformations.

The data herein, combined with those
previously observed for the
effects of phosphorylation on structure in proline-rich peptides,,, suggest a general mode for effects
of serine/threonine phosphorylation on structure. Previously, we found
that phosphorylation induced polyproline helix and resulted in particular
ϕ conformational restriction (3JαN = 3.0–5.5 Hz, corresponding to ϕ
= −50° to −70°), with a value of ϕ consistent
with both polyproline helix and α-helix, as well as strong evidence
of a phosphoserine/phosphothreonine side chain–main chain hydrogen
bond and suggestion of a potential n → π* interaction
between the n – 1 carbonyl (conjugated to
the pSer/pThr amide) and the carbonyl of the phosphoresidue, an interaction
consistent with either polyproline helix or α-helix.,,, Phosphorylation, particularly on threonine, has strong conformational
effects, inducing a compact value of ϕ (which can be observed
as a small 3JαN) and
interaction with its own amide hydrogen (which can be observed as
downfield phosphoserine/phosphothreonine amide chemical shifts and
reduced rates of amide exchange at pH 7–8, even at elevated
temperatures or high salt concentrations). Downfield amide chemical
shifts on phosphorylation have also been observed by others, within
both disordered and ordered peptides, although usually these are not
investigated in a pH range of 7–8 that is necessary to ensure
dianionic phospho-residues (typical pKa values of 5.5–6.0), because of expected (though not observed
by us) increases in amide exchange rates decreasing sensitivity in
the NMR experiment. The effects of phosphorylation on structure observed
herein and previously indicate that side chain–main chain phosphate–amide
hydrogen bonding could be the primary context for the interpretation
of the local structural effects of serine/threonine phosphorylation,
with conformational changes that could be favorable or unfavorable
with respect to secondary structure in a manner readily rationalized
on the basis of these interactions. These results also suggest that
serine/threonine phosphorylation should be highly disruptive to β-sheet
formation.− Notably, tyrosine phosphorylation is not expected
to allow local interaction with the protein backbone and thus is not
expected to exhibit structural effects similar to those observed for
serine/threonine phosphorylation.

Conclusion
The
results herein comprise a systematic investigation of the structural
effects of phosphorylation versus modification with β-d-O-GlcNAc (OGlcNAcylation) on the stability of α-helices
via modification on serine versus threonine hydroxyls, and at the
N-terminus, internal, or C-terminal α-helical positions. Phosphorylation
and OGlcNAcylation are the major intracellular post-translational
modifications of serine and threonine, occurring via regulated enzymatic
responses to a multitude of intracellular and extracellular signals
and resulting in diverse downstream intracellular responses. The results
herein, in combination with our previous results on the effects of
phosphorylation and OGlcNAcylation in disordered regions of proteins,
should provide a broad context for interpreting structural and potentially
functional effects of post-translational modifications of serine and
threonine in intracellular proteins.
