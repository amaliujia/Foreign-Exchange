The lactose
permease of Escherichia coli (LacY) specifically
binds and transports d-galactose and disaccharides containing
a d-galactopyranosyl
ring with a H+ (galactoside/H+ symport) and
does not recognize d-glucose or d-glucopyranosides,
which differ in the orientation of the C4-OH group only. By utilizing
the free energy released from the energetically downhill movement
of H+ in response to the electrochemical H+ gradient
(Δμ̃H+, interior negative
and/or alkaline), LacY catalyzes the uphill (active) transport of
galactosides against a concentration gradient. Because coupling between
sugar and H+ translocation is obligatory, in the absence
of Δμ̃H+, LacY can also transduce
the energy released from downhill sugar transport to drive the uphill
H+ transport with the generation of Δμ̃H+, the polarity of which depends upon the direction
of the sugar gradient (reviewed in refs () and ()).

X-ray crystal structures of wild-type (WT) LacY, the conformationally restricted mutant C154G,, and a single-Cys mutant with a covalently bound inactivator have been determined in the same inward-facing
conformation. In each structure, 12 transmembrane α-helices
are arranged in two six-helix pseudosymmetrical bundles linked by
a long cytoplasmic loop between helices VI and VII. The two six-helix
bundles surround a deep hydrophilic cavity that is tightly sealed
on the periplasmic face and open to the cytoplasmic side only (an
inward-facing conformation). Although the crystal structures suggest
that LacY is rigid, a wealth of biochemical–spectroscopic data− demonstrate that the molecule can open alternatively to either side
of the membrane upon sugar binding, thereby providing evidence of
an alternating-access model for symport (reviewed in refs () and ()).

The initial X-ray
structure of LacY was obtained with a density
at the apex of the central cavity, but at ∼3.5 Å resolution,
side-chain interactions with bound sugar cannot be identified clearly., However, biochemical–biophysical studies show that LacY contains
a single galactoside-binding site and that the residues involved in
sugar binding are located at or near the apex of the central cavity
in the molecule (Figure ). Although the specificity
of LacY is strongly directed toward the C4-OH group of the d-galactopyranosyl ring, the C2-OH, C3-OH, and C6-OH groups are also
important in the following order: C4-OH ≫ C6-OH &gt; C3-OH
&gt; C2-OH., The residues responsible for
sugar binding are located in helices
IV, V, and VIII. Cys-scanning mutagenesis, site-directed alkylation,
thiol cross-linking, and direct binding assays show that Glu126 (helix
IV) and Arg144 (helix V) are critical for substrate binding and probably
charge paired.− Trp151 (helix V), two turns removed from Arg144, stacks aromatically
with the galactopyranosyl ring., Glu269 (helix VIII),
another irreplaceable residue,, is also essential for
sugar recognition and binding and cannot even be replaced with Asp
without dramatically decreasing the affinity., Furthermore, mass spectrometry studies suggest that Glu269 may interact
with the C3-OH group of the galactopyranosyl ring.

entry 2V8N)
viewed from the side with the N-terminal six-helix bundle on the right
and the C-terminal six-helix bundle on the left. Already known sugar-binding
residues are depicted using blue van der Waal spheres, while Asn272
identified in this study is colored red. The NPG sugar is shown as
sticks at the apex of the central cavity.

Cys-scanning mutagenesis and
site-directed
alkylation studies suggest that Asn272,
Gly268, and Val264 on the same face of helix VIII might also be components
of the sugar-binding site, and to gain further insight, we conducted
a set of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The simulations indicate
that Asn272, one turn removed from critical Glu269 in helix VIII,
is very likely a component of the sugar-binding site, while the backbone
at Gly268 or Val264 is unlikely to be directly involved in binding.
Consistently, binding studies with purified mutant LacY molecules
show that of a dozen replacements for Asn272 only mutant N272Q binds
NPG with an affinity similar to that of the WT. All other replacements
exhibit either markedly decreased affinity or no significant binding.
Interestingly, mutant G268A also exhibits a significant decrease in
affinity, suggesting that it may be peripherally involved in binding,
and mutant V264A binds sugar with good affinity, demonstrating that
it is not a component of the sugar-binding site.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Oligonucleotides for site-directed mutagenesis
were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville,
IA). A QuikChange II mutagenesis kit was obtained from Agilent Technologies,
Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New
England Biolabs Inc. (Ipswich, MA). Lactose and p-nitrophenyl α-d-galactopyranoside (NPG) were from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Melibiose was obtained from Acros Organics.
[d-glucose-14C(U)]Lactose was from Moravek Biochemicals,
Inc. (Brea, CA). The penta-His antibody–horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) conjugate was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Supersignal West
Pico Chemiluminescent substrate kits for Western blotting were from
Pierce (Rockford, IL). Micro BCA protein assay kits were from Thermo
Scientific (Rockford, IL).

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
The Multipurpose
Atom-Typer for CHARMM (MATCH), was used to obtain
parameters for NPG. The crystal structure of WT, substrate-free LacY,
in an inward-facing conformation, and including N-terminal Met1 to
C-terminal Ala417 (PDB entry 2V8N), was inserted into a phosphatidylethanolamine lipid
bilayer by aligning the centers of mass of the protein TM domain and
the POPE bilayer, respectively, and removing lipids to avoid protein–lipid
steric clashes. The system was solvated by explicit water molecules,
and counterions were added to achieve electrical neutrality. The three
simulation systems were relaxed using a 10000-step conjugate gradient
energy minimization followed by gradual heating from 0 to 310 K over
120 ps at a constant temperature (310 K) and volume (NVT ensemble). Equilibrated positions of lipids, water molecules, and
the protein were obtained by a series of consecutive 500 ps simulations,
where the harmonic restraints on these groups were successively released
at a constant temperature (310 K) and pressure (1 atm) (NPT ensemble). To introduce the NPG sugar molecule, WT LacY with β-d-galactopyranosyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside
(TDG) coordinates (PDB entry 1PV7) was superimposed on the 1.5 ns NPT-equilibrated LacY structure followed by alignment of NPG with TDG.
Water molecules were removed to eliminate water–NPG steric
clashes, and the equilibration protocol was repeated, i.e., energy
minimization and equilibration of water molecules and protein atoms,
respectively, followed by unrestrained simulation of the wild-type,
G268C, and V264C systems for 206, 79, and 89 ns, respectively.

The MD simulations were conducted with the NAMD 2.7 software package, and the CHARMM22 and CHARMM36 force fields, were used for the protein and lipids, respectively. The TIP3P model
was used for the water molecules. A reversible
multiple-time step (MTS) algorithm was
used to integrate the equations of motion with time steps of 1 fs
for bonded forces, 2 fs for short-range, nonbonded forces, and 4 fs
for long-range, electrostatic forces. The smooth particle mesh Ewald
method, was used to calculate electrostatic interactions.
The short-range interactions were cut off at 12 Å. All bond lengths
involving hydrogen atoms were held fixed using the SHAKE and SETTLE algorithms.
A Langevin dynamics scheme was used for thermostating. Nosé–Hoover–Langevin
pistons were used for pressure control., Molecular
graphics and simulation analyses were generated with VMD version 1.9.1.

Construction of Mutants
All mutants
were constructed
by site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid pT7-5 containing the cassette lacY gene with a C-terminal six-His tag as a template. All
mutations were verified by sequencing of the entire lacY gene and the restriction sites.

Lactose Transport
E. coli T184 [lacI+O+Z–Y– (A) rpsL met–thr–recA hsdM hsdR/F′ lacIq O+ ZD118 (Y+A+)], cells were
transformed with plasmid pT7-5 encoding WT LacY or a
given mutant and grown in LB broth containing 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin
at 37 °C overnight. The culture was diluted into 30 mL of LB
broth and induced with 1 mM (final concentration) IPTG at an OD600 of 0.6. After being induced for 1 h, the cells were assayed
for transport of [1-14C]lactose (10 mCi/mmol, final concentration
of 0.4 mM) by rapid filtration.

Western
Blotting
The cells used in the lactose transport
assays were lysed by sonication. A membrane fraction was obtained
by ultracentrifugation (2.2 × 105 × g, 4 °C for 20 min) and suspended in 0.1 M KPi (pH
7.5) and 10 mM MgSO4. An aliquot of the sample containing
2 μg of membrane protein was used for Western blotting and probed
with the penta-His antibody–HRP conjugate to indentify LacY.

LacY Purification
E. coli XL-1 blue
cells transformed with plasmid pT7-5 encoding a given mutant were
grown in 1 L of LB broth containing 0.1 mg/mL ampicillin at 37 °C
overnight. A 10-fold dilution of the culture was grown in a fermenter
and induced with 0.3 mM (final concentration) IPTG at an OD600 of 0.6. After being induced for 3 h, the cells were harvested and
lysed with a French press. His-tagged LacY in the cell lysate was
purified as described previously. Purified
LacY was solubilized in 50 mM NaPi (pH 7.6) and 0.01% DDM,
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C
until use. The protein concentration was determined by a Micro BCA
protein assay.

NPG Binding
NPG binding measurements
were made with
an SLM-Aminco 8100 spectrofluorometer as described previously with minor modifications. In a 1 cm × 1
cm cuvette, purified WT or a given mutant was diluted in 50 mM NaPi (pH 7.5) and 0.01% DDM to a final concentration of 1 μM
in a volume of 2 mL. α-NPG was added to a given concentration,
and then 30 mM (final concentration) melibiose was added to displace
NPG. Changes in fluorescence resulting from Trp → α-NPG
FRET were recorded while the sample was being constantly stirred and
corrected for dilution caused by addition of the ligand. KD values were determined with GraFit version 6 (Erithacus
Software, London, U.K.) using “1Site-Ligand Binding”
equation

Results
MD Simulations
With the LacY WT crystal structure (PDB
entry 2V8N)
as a starting point, NPG was docked according to coordinates from
the WT structure with β-d-galactopyranosyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (TDG) coordinates (PDB entry 1PV7) (see ). A set of three MD simulations of WT,
G268C, and V264C LacY disclose one major pose of NPG in which Asn272
contributes directly to sugar binding (Figure ). As observed by contact analyses reporting &lt;3.5 Å protein–NPG
interactions, the sugar molecule interacts with residues thought to
be involved in sugar binding (Figure A). A
guanidino group at position 144 (Arg), a carboxyl group at position
126 (preferably Glu), an aromatic residue at position 151 (preferably
Trp), and a carboxyl group at position 269 (Glu) are obligatory for
sugar binding (reviewed in ref ()). The nitro group in NPG is proximal to Ala122 in all three
simulations, which is consistent with previous observations. Rather than being fixed in a single position
with respect to the surrounding protein, the NPG molecule is highly
dynamic, although with one clearly defined preferred binding pose.
This is particularly evident in the wild-type simulation, where NPG
visits the alternative locations in the wide, water-filled cytoplasmic
cleft (Figure A).

Residues Asn272 and Glu269 on helix VIII make contacts
with NPG
(Figure A). In all three simulations, sugar
binding dynamics between Asn272 and the sugar-interacting residue
Glu269 are synchronized (Figure B). However,
neither the backbone at position 268 nor that at position 264 appears
to make contact with the galactopyranosyl ring of NPG (Figure A). In events where Asn272 and Glu269 are in the
proximity of the galactopyranosyl moiety, known sugar-binding residues
Glu126, Arg144, and Trp151 are also exposed to NPG (Figure C).

Lactose Transport
Of 12 Asn272 replacement
mutants
tested, only four (N272D, N272V, N272S, and N272Q) transport lactose
to a steady-state level of accumulation that is ≥30% of the
steady state established by WT LacY in 30 min (in decreasing order,
N272D, N272V, N272S, and N272Q). Mutants N272G and N272A accumulate
to levels that are ∼25 and ∼20% of that of the WT, respectively,
and the activities of the remaining mutants are negligible (Figure A,B). The initial rate of transport by mutant N272D
approximates that of the WT, but the initial rates of transport observed
with mutants N272V, N272Q, and N272S are drastically lower than that
of the WT. Mutant V264A accumulates lactose as well as WT. Although
the initial rate of transport by mutant G268A is similar to that of
the WT, the steady-state level of accumulation is only ∼40%
of that of the WT.

N272W, V264A, or G268A, or no permease was measured at 0.4 mM lactose
for given times as described in . Expression of WT LacY and each mutant as determined by Western
blotting.

Western blotting with the anti-His
antibody reveals that each mutant
is expressed at approximately the same levels as WT LacY (Figure A–C, bottom panels). Therefore, the differences
in transport activity are not due to variations in the expression
of the mutants.

NPG Binding
NPG is a high-affinity
sugar analogue of
lactose, and previous studies show that
the distance between Trp151 in the binding site and the nitrophenyl
group of NPG (∼12 Å) is a favorable distance for Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET). Because the analogue has a broad
absorption spectrum with a maximum at 306 nm (not shown), NPG affects
Trp fluorescence by two simultaneous processes: (1) by serving as
a nonfluorescent FRET acceptor from Trp151 in the binding site and
(2) by acting as an inner filter and absorbing irradiated excitation
light at 295 nm, as well as fluorescence emission of Trp. To discriminate
between the two processes, another lactose analogue, melibiose, which
is not fluorescent and does not absorb light over the range of wavelengths
studied, was used. Addition of saturating concentrations of melibiose
in the absence of NPG causes little or no change in the emission spectrum
of Trp. However, when melibiose is added after incubation with NPG,
an increase in Trp fluorescence is observed because of displacement
of NPG from the binding site. Thus, the increase in Trp fluorescence
upon addition of melibiose represents a specific FRET effect, and
the remainder of the fluorescence change that is not restored by melibiose
represents the nonspecific inner filter effect caused by NPG in solution.
The apparent affinity for NPG is estimated from the concentration
dependence of the specific fluorescence change after addition of excess
melibiose at various NPG concentrations (Figure A–E). The calculated KD of 19
± 1 μM obtained for WT LacY (Figure F) is the same as that obtained previously.

fluorescence induced by addition of melibiose are plotted as a function
of NPG concentration. Differences obtained with mutants N272D, N272E,
N272F, N272S, and N272V were too small for accurate measurement.

In addition to WT LacY, significant
fluorescence changes are observed
with mutant N272Q (Figure E) and to a lesser
extent with mutant N272A (Figure D), and KD values of 20 ± 2 and 143 ± 39 μM,
respectively, are obtained (Figure F and Table ). In contrast, the fluorescence changes observed
with mutants N272D, N272V, N272E, N272F, and N272S were too small
to allow estimates of binding constants. Significant fluoresecence
changes are also observed with mutant V264A, which yield a KD of 30 ± 4 μM (Figure B and Table ). However, mutant G268A
exhibits smaller changes in fluorescence and an affinity for NPG (∼8-fold)
lower than that of WT LacY (Figure C and Table ).

Kinetics of Selected Mutants
The kinetics of lactose
transport for WT LacY and mutants N272D, N272Q, N272V, V264A, and
G268A were measured to determine whether there is a correlation between
the measured KD values and the kinetic
constants (Figure  and Table ). The Km obtained for WT LacY
is ∼0.8 ± 0.1 mM with a Vmax of 442 ± 14 nmol (mg of protein)−1 min–1, in reasonable agreement with previous findings. The Km obtained
for mutant N272D is ∼5 times higher than that of the WT, and
the Vmax is approximately the same as
that of the WT. Replacing Asn272 with Val leads to an ∼15-fold
increase in Km, with a Vmax significantly higher than that of the WT. Remarkably,
although WT LacY and mutant N272Q have essentially the same KD for NPG (Table ),
the Km obtained for lactose transport
is more than 40 times higher for N272Q than for the WT, with a lower Vmax. Finally, replacement of Val264 or Gly268
with Ala has little or no effect on either Km or Vmax (data not shown).

Discussion
The
specificity of LacY for the substrate is directed exclusively
toward the galactopyranosyl ring of the substrate. Thus, the monosaccharide d-galactose is the most specific sugar for LacY, although it
has a very low affinity. Remarkably,
substitutions on the anomeric carbon, particularly if they are hydrophobic,
can lead to a marked increase in affinity (up to ∼3 orders
of magnitude) with no change in specificity.

Asn272 (helix VIII), positioned one turn from Glu269 toward
the
cytoplasmic side, is proximal to the galactopyranosyl ring. Cys-scanning
mutagenesis of helix VIII reveals that mutant N272C transports lactose
only 30% as well as the WT, and site-directed
alkylation demonstrates that mutants N272C, G268C, and V264C are protected
against alkylation by the substrate, suggesting that all three positions
might be in the vicinity of the sugar-binding site. Moreover, sequence alignment data also show that Asn272
is conserved in bacterial galactoside/H+ symporters. Because the interactions of LacY with the substrate
are based primarily upon biochemical findings (reviewed in refs () and ()), to investigate further
a possible role of Asn272, Gly268, and Val264 in sugar binding, we
initially utilized molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

The
simulations reveal a highly dynamic NPG substrate that adopts
a similar docking position in the WT, G268C, and V264C simulations.
It was possible to monitor substrate entering and leaving this docking
pose by tracking interactions between residues Glu269 and Asn272 and
the C4-OH group on the NPG galactopyranosyl ring (Figure B). It is particularly evident in the &gt;200 ns
WT
simulation that the sugar visits alternative positions in the cytoplasmic
cleft. In both mutant simulations, NPG remains in a binding pose that
also involves interaction between the guanidino group of Arg144 and
the C6-OH group of the galactopyranosyl ring. While Glu126 is relatively
far removed, Trp151 is stacked with the under side of the galactopyranosyl
ring and the nitrophenyl group is directed toward Ala122 (Figure C). It is clear that
backbone positions 264 and 268, which have been implicated in sugar
binding, do not interact directly with NPG. Of all atoms in these
positions, the backbone carbonyl oxygen at position 268 is closest
(14.4 ± 3.2 Å), which corroborates an 8-fold decrease in
the affinity of the G268A mutant. Because mutations G268C and V264C
are also relatively far from the NPG-binding site, it is likely that
the three simulations sample the same fundamental protein–sugar
interactions.

Mutagenesis shows that except for mutant N272D,
in which significant
NPG binding cannot be measured, all other replacement mutants tested
exhibit significantly decreased initial rates of lactose transport.
Furthermore, only mutants N272D and N272V accumulate lactose to a
steady state comparable to that of the WT (Figure A,B). Mutant N272Q exhibits low transport activity, but transport
activity in the other mutants is essentially moribund. The transport
defect in mutants N272F, N272Y, and N272W may be due to the bulky
aromatic side chain at position 272, which could sterically block
binding. The low activity of mutants N272G and N272A suggests that
the amide group of Asn272 is probably important for binding.

Mutant N272Q with the most conservative replacement for Asn has
a KD that is essentially the same as that
of the WT, and replacing the amide group with virtually any other
amino acid residue except Ala essentially abolishes NPG binding. Even
with Ala in place of Asn272, the NPG affinity decreases by almost
8-fold. Although it is tempting to try to relate the transport data
presented to the binding observations, it should be emphasized that
the transport studies are conducted with lactose, which binds with
very low affinity, while the binding data are obtained with the high-affinity
homologue NPG. Thus, although the 45-fold increase in Km for mutant N272Q relative to that of the WT may explain
the relatively low lactose transport activity, the KD for NPG is the same as that of the WT. In a similar
vein, there appears to be no correlation whatsoever among decreased
NPG affinity, increased Km, and transport
activity.

In any case, primarily on the basis of the MD simulations
and the
NPG binding data in conjunction with the earlier site-directed alkylation
experiments,, it seems highly probable that
Asn272 is a component of the sugar-binding site in LacY. Previous
site-directed alkylation shows that two additional mutants, V264C
and G268C, are also protected by sugar against NEM labeling. In this
study, replacement of Val264 with Ala does not affect either NPG binding
or the kinetics of lactose transport, indicating that Val264 is not
a component of the sugar-binding site. However, mutant G268A exhibits
an ∼8-fold increase in its KD (i.e.,
a moderate decrease in affinity), but lactose transport remains unchanged.
Although the results are somewhat ambiguous, they imply that the backbone
at the position of Gly268 might interact with bound sugar and that
the moderate decrease in affinity exhibited by mutant G268A may be
due to the steric hindrance. Another possibility is that a Gly residue
at position 268 provides flexibility near the binding site.
