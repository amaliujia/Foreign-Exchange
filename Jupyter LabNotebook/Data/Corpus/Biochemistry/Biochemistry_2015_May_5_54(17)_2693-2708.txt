Heme oxygenase
(HO) is the only
known mammalian enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme and
the production of carbon monoxide, a gaseous signaling molecule. Heme serves multiple cellular and systemic roles
ranging from oxygen carrier in globins, and electron
transport in cytochromes to gas sensor
in various proteins, i.e., Ec DOS,, soluble
guanylate cyclase, and CooA. However, free heme can be commensurably toxic
because it undergoes Fenton-like reactions, producing reactive oxygen
species, which in turn induce oxidative stress and cell death. The concentration of free heme has been estimated
to be very low, with measured values of 0.1 μM or below in erythrocytes.

By degrading pro-oxidant free heme, HO
confers tissue protection.
In a reaction that requires three equivalents of oxygen and seven
electrons supplied by NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 reductase, HO
cleaves the heme ring to yield CO, iron, and biliverdin.− Biliverdin is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase.
In addition to removing free heme, the end products of the HO reaction
have cytoprotective effects. HO-derived iron drives the synthesis
of ferritin, which serves as a protective sink for intracellular redox-active
iron, bilirubin circulates in an albumin-bound
form in the blood and acts as an antioxidant, and CO exerts anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antiproliferative
effects. CO also functions in oxygen sensing
and acts as a signaling molecule that can stimulate soluble guanylate
cyclase to produce guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate.

Two principal isozymes of HO, referred
to as HO1 and HO2, have
been identified in mammals. HO1 and HO2
are products of separate genes and differ
in their regulation and tissue distribution. The first HO to be identified, HO1 is an inducible form of the enzyme and is
present in high concentrations in tissues responsible for heme catabolism,
e.g., liver, spleen, bone marrow, and senescent red blood cells. In
most other tissues, HO1 levels typically are low to undetectable under
basal conditions, but rapidly increase when cells are subjected to
diverse chemical or physical stresses. HO1 is the same inducible protein
that has been known as heat shock protein 32. HO2 expression, by contrast, is constitutive and predominantly in
brain, testes, and neural tissues. Though it does not respond to transcriptional
activation by environmental stress, HO2 has a glucocorticoid response
element in its promoter region, which, in the presence of corticosterone,
may modulate HO2 expression in a tissue-specific manner in the brain and in an age-related fashion in testis. Accordingly, hmox2, the gene
encoding HO2 in rat testis was shown to manifest distinctly sized
transcripts as well as differential expression through various developmental
stages. The perpetual presence of HO2
was conjectured to be vital for testicular function to counterpoise
the reactive oxygen species produced by spermatozoa, with antioxidants
biliverdin and bilirubin, generated from the HO2 reaction, and hence
protect the extremely sensitive sperm cells from the damaging effects
of oxygen radicals.

Structurally,
HO2 has the same α-helical
fold as HO1 with the imidazole nitrogen
of a conserved histidine in the catalytic domain (His25 in HO1 and
His45 in HO2) acting as a heme iron ligand. HO1 and HO2 are highly
homologous (55% identity, 76% similarity for the human proteins) and
are anchored to the microsomal membrane via a similar stretch of 20
hydrophobic residues at their C-termini. Significant differences between these proteins lie in their N-termini,
where HO2 contains an extra 30 amino acid segment, and in their C-termini
between residues 240–295 (HO2 numbering). In this latter region,
HO2, unlike HO1, contains two short amino acid stretches, each containing
a Cys-Pro dipeptide identified as heme regulatory motifs (HRMs). Earlier
studies in our lab have demonstrated that the two Cys residues in
the C-terminal HRMs form a reversible thiol/disulfide redox switch
that modulates the affinity of HO2 for heme as a function of redox
poise,, although the physiological relevance of
this has been questioned. We will designate
the forms of HO2 in which the two C-terminal Cys residues are in the
reduced or oxidized (disulfide) state as HO2R or HO2O, respectively. Furthermore, mutagenesis coupled with electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and magnetic circular dichroism studies
indicated that in the HO2R state, Cys265 can ligate to
Fe3+-heme. One possibility
is that the thiolate of Cys265 could ligate to the catalytic site
heme; however, the heme in HO2 is securely sandwiched between two
helices, as in HO1., The other scenario is that the HRMs form an independent heme binding
site(s), as suggested by studies from the Maines’ laboratory.

While earlier X-ray crystallographic studies
of HO2 revealed interesting
insights into the catalytic core, they failed to provide any structural
insight into the HRMs (C265P266 and C282P283) encompassing the C-terminal region. Of the 288-residue soluble portion of HO2, one construct
that successfully crystallized lacked the two HRM motifs and only
consisted of residues 1–264. Furthermore, the electron density
for residues 1–28 and 249–264 was not observed. Hence,
a total of 68 residues, 28 and 40 at the N- and C-termini respectively,
were missing in the crystal structure. Another 2.5 Å structure
of soluble apo-HO2 (residues 1–288), containing the HRMs was
obtained and deposited (pdb ID 4WMH); however, like the published structure
of the core (1–264), only the electron density for residues
31–237 could be observed. Therefore, while biochemical studies
have indicated an important functional role of HRMs as a redox switch
that regulates heme binding to the enzyme,, a structural perspective of this redox-dependent differential regulation
of substrate (heme) binding to HO2 was missing.

HRMs are found
to modulate the activity of other heme-regulated
proteins, such as the transcription factors, Bach1,, Rev-Erb, and eukaryotic initiation
factor 2α (elF2α) kinase. Although important roles of the HRMs have been demonstrated by mutational
analyses, there is little direct structural insight into how this
motif regulates these systems. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
EPR, electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), and X-ray absorption
(XAS) analyses, we have now shown that the two HRMs near the C-terminus
of HO2 are in a disordered region. Our results indicate that, upon
reduction of the disulfide bond between Cys265 and Cys282, the C-terminal
region including the two HRMs interacts with the catalytic core of
HO2 and that the cysteines in the HRMs directly interact with a second
bound heme.

Materials and Methods
HO2 Expression and Purification
The truncated form
of human HO2(1–288) devoid of the sequence encoding for the
membrane-spanning region at the C-terminus was cloned in a pET28a
(Novagen) vector using the restriction sites NdeI and EcoRI. This resulted in a construct which contained the truncated hmox2 gene preceded by a thrombin cleavage site and a His
tag at the N-terminus.

The hmox2-containing
pET28a plasmid was transformed into BL21-(λDE3) cells. Cells
were grown in Luria Broth (LB) media containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin
at 37 °C until they reached an A600 of 0.8–1.0, then were induced with 1.0 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 25 °C for another
18–20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm
for 30 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall RC3C Plus centrifuge using an
H6000 swinging bucket rotor, weighed, and frozen at −20 °C.

Approximately 8.0–10.0 g of cells obtained per liter of
cell culture was resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris,
400 mM KCl, 4.0 mM imidazole, 0.05% Triton X-100 (v/v) pH 8.0). Into
this suspension, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied
Science) (1 tablet/50 mL) was added along with phenyl methyl sulfonyl
fluoride (1.0 mM final concentration), DNAase I (5 units/mL), and
a pinch of RNAase and lysozyme. The suspension was allowed to stir
at 4 °C for approximately 30 min. Cells were then lysed by sonication
for a total process time of 10 min with repetitive cycles of 7.5 s
of pulse-on and pulse-off. This lysate was further pelleted by spinning
at 30 000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman L8-80M ultracentrifuge
using a Type 45 Ti fixed angle rotor. The supernatant was loaded onto
a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) (Qiagen) affinity column. After
the column was washed extensively with lysis buffer, HO2 was eluted
using a linear gradient of 20–250 mM imidazole contained in
50 mM Tris, 400 mM KCl, pH 8.0 buffer. The HO2 eluted in a broad band
beginning at ∼50 mM imidazole. Aliquots of the fractions were
run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie blue to
determine purity. Fractions with at least 95% purity were combined
and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0. The HO2 concentration was determined using ε280 = 23 505 M–1 cm–1. HO2 was then treated with thrombin
(3 units/mg HO2) at 4 °C for 16 h to cleave the N-terminal His
tag, and the protein was loaded back onto the Ni-NTA column. The cleaved
HO2 now eluted in the wash, and the His tag was retained.

The
cleaved HO2 fractions were then incubated with benzamidine
sepharose resin (GE Biosciences) to bind and hence remove thrombin,
and then treated with 1 mM (final) 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride
to ensure that any remaining thrombin activity was inactivated. Before
use, the purified HO2 was dialyzed against an appropriate buffer and
concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (Millipore)
with a 10-kDa molecular weight cutoff.

Triple-Labeling of HO2
for NMR Studies
For expression
of [U-2H, 15N, 13C]-HO2, the hmox2-containing pET28a plasmid was freshly transformed
into BL21-(λDE3) and plated onto H2O-based LB medium. From an isolated colony, overnight growth was
started in 50 mL of H2O-based M9 minimal medium. Cells were centrifuged the following day, washed
3–4 times with 2H2O-based minimal media,
and then used to inoculate 1 L of 2H2O-M9 minimal
medium (cell density dilution of 1/50), which was supplemented with
vitamin mix (5.0 mg/L thiamine, 1.0 mg/L d-biotin, 1.0 mg/L
choline chloride, 1.0 mg/L folic acid, 1.0 mg/L niacinamide, 1.0 mg/L d-pantothenic acid, 1.0 mg/L pyridoxal, 0.1 mg/L riboflavin) and 1 mL trace elements solution from a 1000×
stock made in 60 mM HCl (50 mM FeCl3, 20 mM CaCl2, 10 mM each of MnCl2 and ZnSO4, and 2 mM each
of CoCl2, CuCl2, NiCl2, Na2MoO4 and H3BO3). Furthermore, 1.0 g/L 15NH4Cl and
1.0 g/L [13C, 2H] glucose (Cambridge Isotope
Laboratories) were added as sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Cells
were allowed to grow at 37 °C for approximately 6 h until they
reached an A600 = 0.8–1.0. At this
point, cells were induced with 1.0 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and grown at 25 °C for another 18–20
h before harvesting by centrifugation. [U-2H, 15N, 13C]-HO2 was purified as described above. Electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry analysis revealed the amount of label
incorporation to be 99.8%.

NMR experiments were performed on
HO2O and HO2R in both the apo and the Fe3+-heme containing (Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R) forms. For disulfide bond reduction, HO2
was transferred into an anaerobic chamber (Vacuum Atmospheres, Inc.)
and reacted for 1 h with a 25-fold molar excess of anaerobically prepared
Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Thermo Scientific).
TCEP was then removed by dialyzing the protein in an anaerobic buffer
against 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.0. Once retrieved from the
dialysis tubing, a sample of HO2 was reacted with 5,5′ dithiobis(nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) to measure thiol groups.
For this, approximately 5–10 μM HO2 was withdrawn in
a 1 mL reaction volume in 50 mM Tris, 8 M urea, pH 8.5 buffer in a
sealed cuvette. After the baseline was adjusted, the protein solution
was treated with 50 μL of DTNB solution from a 10 mM stock.
The absorbance at 412 nm was recorded and, using ε412 = 0.0136 μM–1 cm–1, the
concentration of thiols was calculated.

To prepare NMR samples, heme was added to apo-HO2 from a stock
solution freshly prepared in 15% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 0.1 M
NaOH and buffered at pH 7.0. The heme concentration was determined
by using ε385 = 58.4 mM–1 cm–1. Heme was added to the
protein solution in small increments, monitoring the increase in A404 until the ratio of absorbance of the Soret
peak to that at 280 nm (A404/A280) was constant. Approximately 1.2 mM Fe3+-HO2O and 0.67 mM Fe3+-HO2R [U-2H, 15N, 13C]-HO2 in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM
KCl pH 7.0 plus 10% 2H2O were used to conduct
triple-resonance experiments for sequential backbone assignments.

1H-15N HSQC was performed also on zinc protoporphyrin
(ZnPP)-bound HO2 to monitor any increase in the number of peaks upon
substitution of paramagnetic heme with the diamagnetic ZnPP. ZnPP-bound
HO2 was prepared similarly to heme-bound HO2 except that the concentration
was determined using an extinction coefficient of ε412 = 87.4 mM–1 cm–1.

NMR Experiments for 3D Assignments
All spectra were
acquired at 30 °C on an 800 MHz Varian Inova instrument equipped
with a four-channel pulsed-field gradient triple-resonance cold probe.
Multidimensional experiments used for Cα, Cβ, C′,
N, and HN assignments entailed: TROSY version of 2D 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and 3D HN(CO)CA,
HNCA, HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNCO, and HN(CA)CO. All these experiments
were based on those described in the literature, with minor modifications. The acquisition parameters for the experiments
are summarized in Table .

Experiments
marked with asterisk

labeled-HO2.

Data were processed
using NMRPipe and
analyzed using SPARKY. Time-domain data
in the acquisition dimension were zero-filled to the power of 2 and
apodized with exponential/Gaussian window function. Mirror image linear
prediction was applied to the indirect 15N dimension acquired
with constant-time evolution. Data in the indirect dimensions were
apodized with cosine bell function and zero-filled also to the power
of 2. SAGA and EZ-ASSIGN programs were used for automated backbone resonance assignments,
which are listed in the .

Preparation of HO2 with Selective 15N, 13C-Cysteine
and 2H-Cysteine Labeling
The Escherichia
coli cysteine auxotroph, BL21-(λDE3) selB::kan
cys51E() (kindly provided
by Dr. Paul Ortiz de Montellano, University of California, San Francisco),
henceforth called cysE, was utilized in these preparations.
The cysE gene in E. coli encodes
for enzyme serine acetyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion
of serine to O-acetylserine during cysteine biosynthesis. Thus, the
mutation in the cysE gene disrupts the cysteine biosynthetic
pathway, allowing isotopically labeled cysteine to be incorporated
into the protein by externally supplying it in the growth medium.
Because of the kanamycin resistance of the cysE cells,
the cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid pGEX4T2 containing
the truncated hmox2 gene described previously rather than the pET28a/ hmox2 construct, which also has kanamycin resistance, as above.

Transformed cysE cells were plated on an LB-agar
plate containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL kanamycin,
and 30 μg/L l-cysteine hydrochloride. Overnight growth
was started in 50 mL of LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin,
50 μg/mL kanamycin, and 30 μg/L l-cysteine hydrochloride,
inoculated with a single colony. Cells were pelleted and resuspended
to a cell density dilution factor of 20 mL in 1 L of enriched M9 media.
The enriched media was prepared by first autoclaving the M9 salt solutions
containing 1.0 g/L NH4Cl and then supplementing with amino
acids along with the vitamin and trace element solutions. A 1000×
stock solution for both vitamins and trace elements was prepared in
accord with the concentrations finally desired in the growth media
and added separately. Amino acids were prepared as a 10× stock
and autoclaved. The amino acid solution contained alanine, glutamate,
leucine, and lysine, each at 4.0 g/L (required concentration in the
growth medium of 400 mg/L), and arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid,
glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, methionine, proline, phenylalanine,
threonine, tyrosine, serine and valine, each at 2.0 g/L (required
concentration of 200 mg/L). Tryptophan and 15N, 13C- cysteine or 2H-cysteine were directly added to the
media at concentrations of 50 mg/L and 70 mg/L respectively. Finally,
2.0 mM filter-sterilized MgSO4, 5.0 g/L d-glucose,
and antibiotics were added.

Growth conditions were similar to
those stated above except that
the cells were cultured for only 6 h after induction to avoid scrambling
of the label. HO2 was purified on a glutathione sepharose 4B column
and, subsequently, the GST domain was cleaved and separated as reported
earlier. Label incorporation was confirmed
using chymotrypsin-digest followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. Labeled HO2R was generated using the same TCEP reduction protocol described
above. Samples for HSQC experiments were dialyzed against 50 mM NaH2PO4, 50 mM NaCl pH 7.0 instead of 50 mM Tris-HCl,
50 mM KCl, pH 7.0, to avoid the intense natural abundance peaks from
Tris in the 2D 1H-13C HSQC experiments.

For the heme-bound HO2 (Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R) HSQC samples, heme was also added in a
similar fashion as detailed above. Protein was then passed through
a Zeba spin desalting column (7 kDa molecular weight cutoff) (Thermo
Scientific), to remove excess heme and DMSO. Desalting the protein
of DMSO was important because the later manifests an intense natural
abundance 13C peak from methyl groups at approximately
2.6, 41.5 ppm (1H, 13C), around the same region
where we expected to see Cβ carbon from cysteines involved in
the disulfide bond in 2D 1H–13C HSQC.

Sample Preparation for X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
and Fe K-edge XAS Measurements
EXAFS experiments were performed
on wild type Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R as well as on the Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R states of the double mutants, C127A/C265A
and C127A/C282A. While wild type HO2 was expressed and purified from
the pET28a construct using Ni-affinity columns as described above,
variants were made in pGEX4T2 and purified using the glutathione-affinity
columns. Each of the three protein samples
was split with half of the samples reduced with TCEP, as described
above. Thus, the XAS analyses were performed on six heme-bound samples:
2.0 mM wild type Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R, 1.0 mM C127A/C265A variants of Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R, and 1.0 mM C127A/C282A
variants of Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R. All samples were made in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.0.
Proteins were mixed with 20% glycerol, transferred to the EXAFS cuvettes,
and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Experiments were performed in
triplicate on two separate HO2 preparations.

Fe K-edge XAS data
on the solution samples were measured on beamline 7-3, which is the
standard biological solution XAS beamline at SSRL under standard ring
conditions of 3 GeV and ∼350 mA ring current. Other optical
components used for the experiments were a Si(220) double-crystal
monochromator for energy selection and a Rh-coated harmonic rejection
mirror. Spectra were collected in the fully tuned configuration of
the monochromator. Data on the solution samples were measured in fluorescence
mode using a Canberra 30-element solid-state Ge detector. Internal
energy calibration was accomplished by simultaneous measurement of
the absorption of a Fe foil placed between two ionization chambers
situated after the sample. The first inflection point of the foil
spectrum was fixed at 7111.2 eV. Scans were monitored for photoreduction
throughout the course of data collection, and every sample showed
a small edge-shift associated with photoreduction. The effect of photoreduction
was not observed in the EXAFS region. The Fe K-edge spectral comparisons
presented here are single scan averages to eliminate effects of beam-related
photoreduction. The EXAFS spectra presented for all data sets are
9–25 scan averages and were obtained at a similar signal-to-noise
ratio. A second-order polynomial was fit to the pre-edge region and
subtracted from the entire spectrum as background. A four-region spline
of orders 2, 3, 3, and 3 was used to model the smoothly decaying postedge
region. Data were normalized using the Pyspline program by subtracting a cubic spline and assigning the
edge jump to 1.0 at 7200 eV. Data were renormalized in Kaleidagraph
for quantitation and comparison purposes.

Theoretical EXAFS
signals, χ(k), were calculated using the
program FEFF (Macintosh version 8.4)− on xyz coordinates obtained from the crystal structure of cytochrome c. The structure used for the FEFF calculations was the
truncated active site and included the heme group and the axial amino
acid ligands. The theoretical models were fit to the data using EXAFSPAK. The structural parameters varied during the
fitting process were the bond distance (R) and the
bond variance σ2, which is related to the Debye–Waller
factor resulting from thermal motion, and static disorder of the absorbing
and scattering atoms. The nonstructural parameter E0 (the energy at which the photoelectron wave vector k is 0) was also allowed to vary but was restricted to a
common value for every component in a given fit. Coordination numbers
were systematically varied in the course of the fit but fixed within
a given fit. EXAFS data were fit over k = 2–13.7
Å–1.

EPR and ENDOR Spectroscopy
EPR and
ENDOR experiments
were conducted on unlabeled, selectively 15N, 13C-cysteine labeled, and selectively 2H-cysteine labeled
wild type Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R. Samples containing 50% glycerol were prepared with final
protein concentrations of approximately 1.0 mM. Samples were transferred
to ENDOR tubes and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The 2 K CW EPR/ENDOR
measurements at 35 GHz were performed with a spectrometer described
previously using 100 kHz field modulation
and dispersion mode detection under rapid passage conditions. The 35 GHz pulsed 13C MIMS ENDOR
spectra were obtained using a laboratory-built spectrometer.,

The MIMS ENDOR spectra were recorded with the pulse sequence tp–T–tp–τ–tp–τ-echo, where tp is the
microwave pulse duration and T is the duration of
the applied rf pulse. Frequencies within the rf range chosen for the
spectra were accessed randomly (stochastic ENDOR). Signal averaging
was accomplished by collecting multiples of such spectra rather than
by multiple acquisitions at each frequency.

For a single molecular
orientation and for nuclei with a nuclear
spin of I = 1/2 (1H, 13C),
the ENDOR transitions for the ms =1/2 electron manifolds are observed
at frequencies given by the equationwhere ν
is the nuclear Larmor frequency
and A is the orientation dependent hyperfine coupling.

Results
Three-Dimensional NMR Experiments of Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R
Initially, we
assumed that the NMR spectrum of apo-HO2, without paramagnetic heme
(Fe3+; in a linear combination of S =
5/2 and S = 3/2 states), would be the best NMR assignment
target. It was expected that the assignments would be transferrable
to the more biologically relevant heme-bound state, since the crystal
structures of the HO2 catalytic core in its heme-bound and apo forms
are nearly superimposable. However, apo-HO2O showed dramatic changes in the chemical shifts when overlaid
on Fe3+-HO2O (Figure ). Moreover, apo-HO2O precipitated at 30 °C during
the course of the 4-h run and was thus deemed unsuitable for the long
3D assignment experiments. Therefore, studies here focused on Fe3+-HO2O, with the expectation that several residues
in the heme vicinity cannot be assigned due to paramagnetic broadening.
Hence, a suite of triple-resonance NMR experiments was conducted on
[U-2H, 15N, 13C]-Fe3+-HO2O for sequential backbone assignments. The construct contained
residues 1–288, comprising all HRMs and lacking only the membrane-spanning
region at the C-terminus.

Overlay of the 800 MHz 1H- 15N TROSY-HSQC
spectra of Fe3+-HO2O in red with apo-HO2O in blue, showing changes in chemical shifts in all parts
of the protein. Inset zooms in on the crowded region in the middle
of the spectrum. HO2 was present at a concentration of 250 μM
in 50 mM Tris HCl, 50 mM KCl, pH 7.0 buffer. The spectra were collected
at 30 °C.

At concentrations above
10 μM, HO2 is homodimeric in solution
as gauged by quantitative gel-filtration and NMR relaxation experiments. Hence, it was necessary to perdeuterate the
nonexchangeable sites in HO2 to improve the sensitivity and resolution
in the NH-detected dimension, which occurs as a result of decreased
amide proton transverse relaxation rates. The extent of 2H incorporation was verified with electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. A difference in molecular
weight of 58 Da from an expected mass of 36 915 Da for a fully
triple-labeled protein was noted, revealing 99.8% label assimilation.
Sample conditions for NMR experiments were determined by testing protein
stability in different buffers of pH values ranging from 4.5 to 9.0
at intervals of 0.5 pH units and acquiring several 15N-1H HSQCs for heme-bound HO2 at temperatures ranging from 15
to 45 °C at intervals of 5 °C each (data not shown). After
comparing all the spectra, the optimal buffer pH and temperature for
running the experiments were determined.

The 15N-1H TROSY HSQC of [U-2H, 15N, 13C]-labeled Fe3+-HO2O is shown in Figure . The spectrum exhibits
degenerate, sharp peaks in the 7.7–8.5 ppm chemical shift region,
characteristic of an intrinsically unfolded domain and less intense, well-dispersed peaks in the remaining
amide region reflective of a structured core domain. 15N-1H TROSY spectra were also collected at a larger spectral
width (16.75 to −7.25 ppm) in the 1H dimension to
identify NH peaks that may have plausibly shifted away from the typical
amide proton spectral window due to paramagnetic effects. However,
no additional NH peaks could be identified on either side of the normal
amide range (data not shown). The spectra recorded for sequential
backbone assignments included the TROSY versions of 2D 15N-1H HSQC and 3D HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB,
and HN(CO)CACB TROSY experiments. These experiments have provided
the 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO chemical shifts of (i–1)th and (i)th amino acid residues to connect the
adjacent amino acids through heteronuclear scalar correlations. For
assignment purposes, peaks specifying the chemical shifts of various
backbone nuclei of a particular residue were gathered and grouped
into data cliques called generic spin systems (GS). A total of 140 out of the 279 non-proline residues could
be assigned with complete certainty. This included approximately 78%
of the residues at the N-terminus that are not seen in the electron
density map and 92% of the non-proline residues (34 of 37) at the
C-terminus. Thus, the NMR results allow assignment of nearly all residues
in the HRM-containing C-terminal domain, which were either missing
in the electron density map or were not a part of the construct used
in the X-ray structure determination (Figure ). Although EZ-ASSIGN and SAGA programs were entrusted for most of
the assignments, some of the degenerate regions at the C-terminus
had to be identified manually using strip plots in SPARKY and using
specialized pseudo-4D experiments ().

which no electron density was observed in the crystal structure. Yellow
areas indicate assigned residues and black boxes encompass HRMs.

Assignments of core residues were
sparse and scattered (). The small
number of assignments of the core can directly be attributed to incomplete
spin systems (). These omissions can occur due to
the combined effects of the α-helical nature of HO2, which causes
crowding of peaks in the same center of the spectrum where the intense
peaks of the unfolded tails occur, the large size of the protein (63
kDa for the dimer), and line-broadening caused by the paramagnetic
Fe(III) center. The ferric heme in HO2 resides in a combination of S = 5/2 and S = 3/2 states. When the electron
spin T1 relaxation time (τs) is shorter than the rotational correlation time (τc) of the protein, it is not possible to observe NMR signals of nuclei
sensing the paramagnetic Fe3+ center. τs for Fe3+ (high spin) is
10–10–10–11 s, which is
much shorter than τc for the 63-kDa dimeric HO2 of
2.8 × 10–8 s. Hence
it is expected that the heme will broaden away the resonances for
any residues within a radius of approximately 10 Å surrounding the ferric heme-center. From distance
measurements performed on the crystal structure, this would encompasses
15 residues: T41-Q49 and Y154-G159 in the proximal and distal helices,
respectively. Obviously, it would be desirable to work with the HO2
protein with a diamagnetic heme; however, that state is not available
in either the ferric or ferrous forms. As a next best step, the heme
can be converted to a low-spin ferric (S = 1/2) state
by azide or cyanide coordination, which
should reduce the radius of nuclei affected by paramagnetic broadening.
Regretfully, no increase in the number of peaks was detected for the
azide complex (), while the cyano complex revealed a significantly reduced
number of peaks (data not shown). The diamagnetic ZnPP-bound HO2O was also monitored in 15N-1H TROSY
HSQC to see if some of the weaker peaks would be more intense (). However, there
was no increase in either the intensity or the number
of peaks. Together, these experiments suggest that paramagnetics is
not the only cause of signal loss in oxidized HO2.

In an attempt
to reduce the number of intense peaks in the center
of the NMR spectrum, we also collected data on HO2 constructs in which
the N-terminal region (residues 1–28) was absent. However,
many chemical shift changes for the core resonances were observed,
indicating deletion of this region leads to major structural/dynamical
changes in the protein.

Because of the above considerations,
we focused on the spectra
of wild-type Fe3+-HO2O for assignments, even
though some of the resonances would be unobservable due to the paramagnetism
and the crowding effect mentioned above. While the overall assignment
of the NMR spectrum for HO2O was not complete, most of
the assignments for the C-terminal area containing the HRMs could
be made (Figure ). It is to be noted that
peaks pertaining to cysteines in the HRMs could not be identified
in the 3D spectra, and therefore additional experiments using specifically
labeled Cys (described below) were performed for their unambiguous
identification. The secondary structure of the C-terminal region was
delineated using the chemical shift index (CSI) method,, which makes use of the difference between the observed chemical
shift and the random coil value assigned in an unfolded conformation
to a particular amino acid type. Random
coil chemical shifts are primarily determined by the chemical composition
of the side chain of a given amino acid, while chemical shifts for
residues within α-helices or β-sheets are characteristic
of the respective secondary structures and exhibit opposite signs,
negative and positive for helices and sheets, respectively. The resulting CSI plot (Figure ) generated for the α-carbons of residues 245–288
of Fe3+-HO2O clearly demonstrates that this
C-terminal region is present as an unfolded and dynamic random coil.
CSI analysis of the N-terminal region, residues 1–28, indicates
that this region also exists as an unfolded, dynamic random coil ().

in the C-terminal tail of Fe3+-HO2O. The values
of CSI for β-strand, α-helix, and random coil are +1,
−1, and 0, respectively, as defined by the program CSI. Missing indices correspond to M262, which could
not be assigned and the prolines (254, 266, and 283) for which assignments
cannot be determined in the H-detect experiments. The assigned secondary
structure illustrates the C-terminal region to be a random coil in
Fe3+-HO2O.

Three-Dimensional NMR Experiments of Fe3+-HO2R
Aiming to identify the changes that occur, if any,
in the C-terminal tail of the reduced protein, NMR spectra of the
Fe3+-HO2R were collected. Qualitatively, the 15N–1H TROSY HSQC evinced similar spectral
characteristics as those of Fe3+-HO2O with overlapping,
degenerate peaks occupying the central portion of the spectrum and
dispersed, weaker peaks in the remaining amide region (Figure ); however, significant differences may be noted.
Although peaks in the TROSY spectrum of Fe3+-HO2R were generally weaker than those of Fe3+-HO2O, the disordered N-terminal region had peaks at nearly the same intensity.
This indicates that the structure of the N-terminal region of HO2
is independent of the redox state of the C-terminal HRMs. In addition,
this region serves as a suitable internal standard to examine peaks
in the C-terminal region. Further, when compared with Fe3+-HO2O, the spectrum for Fe3+-HO2R manifested at least 12 new peaks and disappearance of approximately
seven. Unfortunately, because these 12 peaks were rather weak had
incomplete GSs, we were unable to assign them.  summarizes the total number
of peaks picked in different spectra in HO2O and HO2R. It is clear that Fe3+-HO2O has significantly
more GSs with a complete set of six rungs—about 106 compared
to 62 for Fe3+-HO2R.

Significantly, the
seven peaks that are absent in the Fe3+-HO2R spectrum correspond to residues 267–272 in the vicinity of
HRM1 (C265P266) in the C-terminal tail (Figure ). These peaks are extremely intense in the Fe3+-HO2O spectrum, and no new peaks of similar intensity
appear in the spectrum of Fe3+-HO2R. The loss
of peaks most likely results from the interaction of the HRM with
paramagnetic heme or from interaction of cysteines with the catalytic
core.

that have disappeared in the reduced form.

To examine if coordination of HRM-cysteine to the paramagnetic
Fe3+ in Fe3+-HO2R is the only cause
of broadening of peaks in the C-terminal region, 15N-1H TROSY of diamagnetic ZnPP-bound HO2O and HO2R were collected (Figure ). Surprisingly,
in the ZnPP-HO2R spectrum, the same peaks (corresponding
to residues 267–272) disappear, as those seen for Fe3+-HO2R. Therefore, it is unlikely that paramagnetism is
the single cause of the peak disappearance in Fe3+-HO2R. Evidently, an additional effect is in play. If we hypothesize
that the tail were to (transiently) dock to the core region, this
would cause line-broadening effects for the HRM resonances, making
them more difficult to detect and assign. We have some additional
evidence that such a docking process occurs in Fe3+-HO2R. For example, in that state, some HO2 core residues were
noted to undergo slow to intermediate exchange causing doubling of
peaks.

1H- 15N TROSY overlay of the ZnPP-bound HO2O (blue) and HO2R (orange). Inset shows residues
that have completely disappeared in the HO2R spectrum.
These are the same residues in the C-terminal region around Cys265
as those monitored for Fe3+-HO2R. HO2 was present
at a concentration of approximately 200 μM each in 50 mM Tris,
50 mM KCl, pH 7.0 buffer.

Therefore, we suggest that the HRM region is no longer a
dynamic
random coil in the reduced state. Regretfully, because of lacking
assignments, we have not been able to characterize its structure,
or its docking location as of yet.

Assignment of the Cysteine
Residues in the TROSY Spectra of
Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R
As we could not identify backbone signals for the cysteine
residues themselves from the 3D spectral assignment procedure, we
selectively labeled the cysteine residues in HO2, allowing the unambiguous
assignments of their NMR signals and serving as a direct monitor of
the impact of changing redox conditions. 15N, 13C-cysteine labeled HO2 was expressed and purified as described in
the . 3D HNCA, HN(CA)CO, and HNCACB
experiments were collected in a 2D mode using parameters listed in
Table  in the . These experiments select for residues that contain both15N and 13C labels, hence suppressing signals
from residues that became isotopically enriched due to scrambling.
NH peaks for the three cysteines of HO2 (Cys127, Cys265, and Cys282)
could be observed for the HO2O, while none of these signals
were seen in the corresponding spectra of the HO2R (). We would expect
to have at least observed the signal for Cys127; however, even in
the spectra of the oxidized protein, the signal for Cys127 is much
weaker than those for Cys265 and Cys282. Therefore, in the reduced
protein this resonance may be buried among the multitude of signals
arising from the catalytic core.

Fe K-Edge EXAFS
Fe K-edge EXAFS data for wild-type
Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R and the corresponding C127A/C265A and C127A/C282A variants are presented
in Figure A–C, respectively. The spectra
of wild-type and the C127A/C265A variant in the oxidized and reduced
states differ between k ≈ 4–9 Å–1. This difference indicates that, upon reduction,
a first shell structural change occurs at the Fe center. On the other
hand, the EXAFS data for HO2O and HO2R of the
C127A/C282A mutant are very similar over the entire EXAFS region indicating
that, when Cys265 is present alone, there is little to no change in
the geometric structure upon changes in redox state.

A comparison of k3-weighted EXAFS data
of (A) WT Fe3+-HO2° (green line), WT Fe3+-HO2R (black line), (B) C127A/C265A Fe3+-HO2O (blue line), C127A/C265A Fe3+-HO2R (black
line), and (C) C127A/C282A Fe3+-HO2O (red line),
C127A/C282A Fe3+-HO2R (black line).

FEFF fits were performed on the EXAFS data from
all six samples.
The first shell of the wild type and C127A/C265A forms of Fe3+-HO2O were fit with 5.5 Fe–N/O components followed
by single and multiple scattering component from the heme ring at
higher R values. Since EXAFS has an ∼20% error
in coordination number determination, these data are consistent with
either a five- or six-coordinate first shell of light atoms. Attempts
to improve the first shell by inclusion of an Fe–S component
resulted in only negligible improvement (see below).

To test
for the presence of an Fe–S(Cys) interaction, all
data sets were fit with and without an Fe–S component. For
the fits with an Fe–S component the starting structure for
the first shell included 5 Fe–N (tests were also performed
with 5.5 Fe–N) at ∼2.0 Å and 1 Fe–S at ∼2.25
Å, and for the fits without an Fe–S component, the starting
structure for the first shell included 4 Fe–N at 2.0 Å
and 0, 1, or 2 Fe–O at ∼2.1 Å. The second and third
shells of EXAFS data were fit with single and multiple scattering
contributions from the heme ring. Fits to all data
sets improved (as indicated by an improvement in the goodness of fit
parameter F) upon the addition of an Fe–S interaction and were
consistently better than the fits without an Fe–S component.
This would be expected, as addition of a weak contribution to the
EXAFS data could be accommodated in the fit giving a false improvement
in the F values. This is affirmed by the Fe–S
σ2 value (related to Debye–Waller factor),
which was characteristically high indicating either a weak interaction
or partial cysteine coordination, where present.

To parse the
structural differences between oxidized and reduced
protein and to deterministically ascertain the presence of the Fe–S
component, two fit parameters were compared: the Fe–S σ2 and the change in F values
of the fit upon addition of the Fe–S component. The results
are presented in Tables  and . A large Fe–S σ2 (larger than 1000)
and a small change in fit F value (less than 0.1)
between the fits with and without Fe–S indicates negligible
improvement upon addition of the Fe–S component and hence the
absence of Fe–S binding. On the basis of this analysis, the
best fits to the Fourier transforms and corresponding EXAFS data are
presented in , and the complete set of fit parameters are presented in . The fits indicate
that an Fe–S bond is not present in Fe3+-HO2O and the C127A/C265A variant of Fe3+-HO2O, while all other systems have an Fe–S(Cys) bond (including
the Fe3+-HO2° and Fe3+-HO2R forms
of the C127A/C282A variant). Since the C127A/C282A variant can only
form an Fe–S bond using Cys265, these EXAFS data indicate that
Cys265 participates in Fe–S coordination in this variant. The
Fe3+-HO2R form of C127A/C265A also shows the
presence of an Fe–S component, indicating that Cys282 can also
bind to the Fe site. In wild type HO2, where both Cys265 and Cys282
are present, the reduced form shows the strongest evidence for S-ligation.
On the basis of the EXAFS data, either of the two cysteine residues
appear to act as a ligand to Fe in wild type Fe3+-HO2R. Our structural model of a low-spin, six-coordinate heme
site with an axial N(His) and a S(Cys) ligand is observed in several
other protein systems, including human cystathionine beta-synthase., EXAFS data on the oxidized protein show a coordination of 5 Fe–N
at 1.98 Å and 1 Fe–S at 2.29 Å, which is, within error, identical to our results, lending
support to the EXAFS-based structure in the HO2 systems presented
here.

Fe K-Edge XANES
To obtain complementary
information
to that obtained from Fe K-edge EXAFS analysis, the Fe K-edge XAS
data for Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R and for the corresponding double mutants, C127A/C265A and
C127A/C282A, are presented in Figure A–C,
respectively. The rising edge energies (measured at 0.5 normalized
intensity) for Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R are at 7123.6 and 7122.8 eV, respectively. The values
for the Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R forms of the C127A/C265A variant are 7123.5 and 7123.0 eV,
respectively, and at 7123.1 eV for the Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R forms of the C127A/C282A variant
(Table ). Both the edge positions and the
spectral shape of the data presented in Figure  indicate a change in values for Fe3+-HO2O and
the C127A/C265A variant of Fe3+-HO2O upon disulfide
bond reduction to Fe3+-HO2R, while no change
is indicated for the C127A/C282A variant upon reduction.

The shift in the rising-edge to lower energy
upon disulfide bond
reduction is characteristic of either a change in redox state of the
iron or a switch in ligation from a light (N, O) to a heavy ligand
(typically S or Cl). The redox state of iron remained ferric, since
TCEP was exhaustively removed from HO2R samples before
Fe3+-heme addition, as demonstrated conclusively by EPR
and UV–visible spectra (data not shown). Therefore, the observed
energy shift is most likely due to a ligation change. The trends in
edge data shift upon reduction in wild-type and C127A/C265A variant
are consistent with the EXAFS results and indicate S binding in the
disulfide-reduced form of these two proteins. The smaller shift in
the C127A/C265A variant can be interpreted as a weaker coordination
of Cys282 compared to Cys265, and it is expected that in wild-type
Fe3+-HO2R, the dominant Fe–S coordination
is via Cys265; however a smaller contribution from Cys282 cannot be
ruled out based on the XAS data. In the C127A/C282A variant, the edge
data for Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R overlay and are qualitatively similar to the reduced form
of wild-type and the C127A/C265A variant. This together with the EXAFS
data suggest that Cys265 is bound to the Fe center in both the OHO2O and HO2R forms of this variant.

Together, the Fe K-edge EXAFS and XANES data strongly support sulfur
coordination in wild-type HO2R and its variants. The data
also suggest that Cys265 binds with somewhat higher affinity relative
to Cys282 to the Fe center, but both cysteine residues are able to
coordinate upon reduction.

EPR and ENDOR Analyses
The X- and
Q-band EPR spectra
of Fe3+-HO2O show the ferric heme to be predominantly
in the high-spin state with gperp = 5.8,
and a weak low-spin signal (signal X) with rhombic g-values g = [2.87, 2.26, 1.63] (Figure ) (). As reported earlier for myoglobin and HO1,− the high- and low-spin signals are assigned to hexacoordinate Fe3+ heme with N/O (His/water) ligation and the low-spin signal
to hexacoordinate Fe3+ heme, with His/OH serving as the
two axial ligands. In Fe3+-HO2R, the high-spin
signal (observed with Fe3+-HO2O) remains at
approximately the same intensity and a new low-spin signal appears
with rhombic g tensor, g = [2.41, 2.26,
1.91] (signal Y). The spectrum of Fe3+-HO2R also contains the weak low-spin signal X from
Fe3+-HO2O as evidenced in the shoulder at g = 2.87. The new low-spin signal Y observed
for Fe3+-HO2R corresponds to that commonly observed
for ferric heme bound with thiolate as an axial ligand., The appearance of this signal without loss of intensity from heme X suggests that signal Y is associated with a
second bound heme.

The arrows show the g-values for the high and low
spin state of the heme.

To further characterize the low-spin ferric-heme of HO2, 1H and 13C ENDOR experiments were performed on samples
in H2O/D2O buffer and on protein that had been 2H-Cys and 13C-Cys labeled. 1H ENDOR
spectra were collected at multiple fields between g = 2.9 and 2.4 (). In the spectrum taken at the g1 =
2.87 feature of signal X of Fe3+-HO2O in H2O buffer (Figure ), there
is a 1H signal with A = 10 MHz that is
lost upon exchange into D2O buffer. In agreement with previous
reports on several heme proteins,, this is assigned
to HxO as one of the heme axial ligands
in Fe3+-HO2O; histidine is the second axial
ligand.

1H 35 GHz CW ENDOR spectra of Fe3+-HO2R recorded at the two unique g values. Spectra
were recorded in H2O (black), D2O (red), or
in H2O with 2H-Cys-labeled protein (green).
The braces show the range of the proton coupling. Experimental conditions:
Temperature, 2 K; Microwave frequency, 34.9 GHz; Modulation amplitude,
2G; RF sweep rate, 1 MHz/s; rf excitation was broadened to 100 kHz.

The 1H ENDOR spectrum
collected at g1 = 2.41 for signal Y of Fe3+-HO2R (Figure ), where signal X gives only a minor contribution
to the EPR intensity, exhibits a
broad feature corresponding to A ≈ 7 MHz.
This 1H ENDOR spectrum was unaffected by D2O
exchange, indicating that the heme center responsible for signal Y does not have an aqua (HxO)
ligand. Instead, the response at g1 =
2.41 from proton(s) with A ≈ 7 MHz is eliminated
in a 1H ENDOR spectrum collected from 2H-Cys-labeled
Fe3+-HO2R (Figure ).
This result provides direct evidence for cysteine ligation to the
ferriheme of Fe3+-HO2R. The only previous investigation
of hyperfine coupling to protons/deuterons of a cysteine bound to
a heme iron was for a compound I. The
coupling (&lt;6 MHz) is slightly less than that observed for Fe3+-HO2R; however, in compound I, spin coupling between
the porphyrin radical and the S = 1 ferryl would
be expected to reduce the observed coupling. Cysteine coordination
is confirmed by 13C MIMS ENDOR spectra of [13C-Cys]-labeled Fe3+-HO2R (Figure ). The 13C MIMS ENDOR spectrum at g1 = 2.41 shows a doublet centered at the 13C larmor frequency, with the very small hyperfine coupling
of A1 = 0.30 MHz. These peaks are absent
in the unlabeled sample (black); inspection of 13C hyperfine
spectra coupling at the three unique g-positions
suggest that A is roughly isotropic, Aiso ≈ 0.3 MHz.

The absence of the signal from
the exchangeable aqua ligand for
signal Y, and the presence of a 13C signal
from the 13C-Cys labeled protein indicate that the species
responsible for signal Y has a Cys, but not an aqua,
ligand, suggesting a His/Cys coordination environment.

Discussion
The HRM, containing a cysteine-proline (CP) diad, has recently
received increasing attention as an important sequence motif in heme-binding
and heme-regulated proteins.,, The functional significance of the CP motif has, however, remained
elusive from a structural or physiological standpoint. It has been
proposed to moderate biochemical processes via cysteine ligation of
the heme iron, speculated mostly through mutational analysis on a
limited number of proteins.

We
set out to conduct structural studies on Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R using NMR, EPR, ENDOR,
and XAS spectroscopies in order to probe if and how the HRM is involved
in redox regulation of HO2. In attempts to understand the function
of HRMs in HO2, our lab had previously demonstrated approximately
10-fold differential affinity of HO2 for Fe3+-heme that
was dependent on the redox state of the two HRMs present in the C-terminal
region. However, a tryptophan fluorescence
quenching study showed only a small (2.5-fold) difference in heme
affinity between Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R. Furthermore, continuous-wave
electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) studies had evinced a large
proportion of low-spin Fe3+ heme with g-values characteristic of thiol ligation in Fe3+-HO2R as opposed to a predominant high-spin state indicative of
His/water ligation in Fe3+-HO2O. On the basis of these results combined with
mutagenesis studies, we proposed that, in Fe3+-HO2R, Cys265 interacts with the active site heme. However, on the basis of 13C-NMR and mutagenesis
studies, Ortiz de Montellano’s group concluded that any interactions
between heme and the Cys265 thiolate are transient.

In another related study, resonance Raman (RR) revealed
that the
Fe3+-heme spin-state is not a function of the redox state
of cysteines in HO2 but rather a temperature-dependent phenomenon. In both Fe3+-HO2O and
Fe3+-HO2R samples, identical spectral features
suggestive of the six-coordinate low-spin Fe3+ were observed
for data collected at 77 K, while bands characteristic of high-spin
Fe3+ heme were observed at 273 K. An earlier RR study on HO1 had also showed an increase in the low-spin
population at lower temperatures. Both
CW-EPR and RR spectroscopy are powerful techniques for revealing oxidation
state, spin state, and ligands of the metal cofactor (although limited
to paramagnetic species for EPR). For example, the presence of a coordinating
Cys in cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) was confirmed by the detection
of a Fe(III)-S(Cys) stretching mode sensitive to 34S-labeling. However, further information about changes in
the overall protein structure and in metal–ligand bond distances
upon changes in redox state of the HRMs was needed to more fully understand
the role of the HRMs in heme binding to HO2.

Given the lack
of consensus about the role of the HRMs of HO2 and
their ability to bind heme, we performed studies to clarify whether
or not the HRMs are involved in binding heme and to reinvestigate
the redox dependence and the stability of such an Fe–S interaction.
The methods used in this study, including XAS, EXAFS, EPR, and ENDOR,
confirm the involvement of the HRMs in heme binding when the protein
is in the disulfide-reduced state (i.e., Fe3+-HO2R). From the shift of the Fe K-edge to lower energy in the reduced
proteins relative to their corresponding oxidized forms, it was deduced
that a heavy ligand, likely ‘S’, coordinates to the
metal center. Furthermore, EXAFS was used to determine the atomic
neighbors of the Fe3+ atom and their bond distances, and
the results indicate that, while there is no ‘S’ ligand
in the Fe3+-HO2O, sulfur coordination was present
in Fe3+-HO2R. Lastly, 1H ENDOR spectra
of Fe3+-HO2R and [2H-Cys]-labeled
Fe3+-HO2R clearly demonstrate cysteine ligation
and lack of water ligation in the species with a resonance at g = 2.41.

In addition to confirming a role for the
HRMs of Fe3+-HO2R, the results of the current
study address the role
of the HRMs from a structural perspective. NMR results indicate that
the region containing the HRMs is unstructured and mobile in Fe3+-HO2O. Seven of the strong peaks corresponding
to residues 267–272 in the vicinity of Cys265 and Cys282 of
the HRMs in the C-terminal region are absent from the TROSY spectrum
of Fe3+-HO2R. This result supports the conclusions
from ENDOR and EXAFS that the HRM is involved in paramagnetic heme
coordination in this state. However, and surprisingly, upon comparing
the spectra of Fe3+-HO2R and ZnPP-bound HO2R, we again found that peaks corresponding to residues 267–272
were missing in the ZnPP-bound HO2R. Hence, while a paramagnetic
effect likely is an important contributing factor, we hypothesize
that the loss in signal intensity is also partially caused by (transient)
docking of the HRM region on the HO2 core.

The results described
here can be related to a working model (Figure ) that represents the catalytic core of HO2 as
a well-structured domain that tightly binds heme in both the Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R redox
states. On the basis of our NMR results, the C-terminal tail containing
the HRMs is represented as a highly mobile unstructured domain that
gains some structure and docks near/on the catalytic core in the Fe3+-HO2R state. Figure  also
presents two testable models for how Fe3+-HO2R binds heme. The first option is that the cysteine thiolate of one
of the HRMs (most likely Cys265) ligates to heme bound in the catalytic
site. The second option is that the HRM directly binds a second heme.

Model
describing the redox-dependence of heme binding to the HRMs
of HO2. In Fe3+-HO2°, the thiolate of Cys265 is sequestered
in a disulfide bond and is unavailable to ligate heme. However, upon
reduction of the disulfide bond in Fe3+-HO2R, the free thiolate is available to bind to heme. Further studies
are required to discriminate between binding of Cys265 to heme in
the catalytic core or directly to a second heme in the HRM. However,
as discussed in the manuscript, we favor the latter scenario.

The EPR spectrum of Fe3+-HO2R is consistent
with either His/Cys or Cys/H2O ligation, but the 1H ENDOR spectrum of Fe3+-HO2R exchanged into
D2O clearly demonstrates that the g =
2.41 signal is not associated with H2O. Therefore, it is
not unreasonable to suppose that Cys265 or Cys282 can ligate to the
heme at the catalytic core with His45, providing a direct way for
the protein to sense the redox state of the cell.

On the other
hand, the heme in HO2 is securely sandwiched between
two helices, and the position of the
heme is nearly identical in HO1,, which does
not have HRMs. Therefore, from a structural perspective, it would
be surprising for a Cys-thiolate in the C-terminal tail heme to disrupt
the local structure and displace the Fe3+-H2O bond at the catalytic core of HO2 to become ligated to the catalytic
site heme.

The current NMR data can neither confirm nor refute
this hypothesis
since assignments of the core were sparse and scattered, hence providing
no structural insights into the events occurring at the catalytic
site upon reduction of the disulfide bond. However, the EPR and ENDOR
results favor binding of a second heme to the HRM. While Fe3+-HO2O contains a high-spin and low-spin signal (X) characteristic of His/OHx ligation,
Fe3+-HO2R contains both the high-spin heme and
signal X associated with Fe3+-HO2O as well as signal Y, suggesting that this form of the
protein contains a mixture of His/water and His/Cys ligation. Since
the high-spin signal associated with heme ligation at the core remains
relatively the same in both Fe3+-HO2O and Fe3+-HO2R, the appearance of a new low spin species
in Fe3+-HO2R suggests the binding of a second
heme rather than conversion of the His/water-ligated heme at the core
to His/Cys. Therefore, we favor the second hypothesis described in
Figure  in which Fe3+-HO2R contains two hemes - one bound at the catalytic site and
the other at the HRM.

That the HRMs could form an independent
heme binding site(s) was
suggested by studies from the Maines’ laboratory. Heme bound to 10-residue peptides spanning either
Cys265 or Cys282 with seemingly high affinity, though with slightly
higher affinity to the peptide containing Cys265. Indeed, a recent characterization of heme binding to peptides
with CP-containing motifs demonstrates that Kd values can be as low as ∼1 μM. While these values are weak in comparison to the affinity
of the catalytic site of HO2 for heme (Kd = 0.03 μM), it suggests that
in Fe3+-HO2R heme could be bound by catalytic
site in addition to one of the C-terminal HRMs. Therefore, the results
presented above suggest that the weak and/or transient interactions
of the HRMs with heme may be due to the lower affinity of the HRMs
for heme as compared to that of the catalytic site and/or incomplete
occupancy of the potential binding sites.

Recent NMR studies
of a 23-mer peptide containing a CP-motif demonstrate
that cofactor binding increases structural definition in the immediate
vicinity of the CP motif. The results
are consistent with what was observed in our NMR studies, in which
residues near the HRMs appeared to lose mobility upon reduction of
the disulfide bond. Therefore, the loss of peaks corresponding to
the residues near the HRMs in HO2 could be from heme binding as well
as docking near the catalytic core, as suggested by results of the
NMR experiments with ZnPP bound to the catalytic core of HO2.

The potential for an independent binding site(s) at the HRMs of
Fe3+-HO2R is not inconsistent with the NMR-derived
hypothesis that the (heme-bound) HRM region docks on the core of HO2
upon reduction of the disulfide bond. This hypothetical docking may
be important for transferring information about cellular conditions
to the rest of the protein. For instance, the HRMs of HO2 have been
implicated in NO sensing, while the HRMs
could reasonably be involved in sensing heme levels. In addition,
as suggested by our model (Figure ), heme
could be trafficked between the HRM and the catalytic core, which
would necessarily involve interaction of the HRM with the catalytic
core.

Experiments validating the inference that the HRMs of
Fe3+-HO2R form an independent heme binding site(s)
are described
in the accompanying paper, while further
experiments are underway to explore the possible role of such a site.
Regardless, the results presented here imply an important role for
HRMs in sensing the redox state of the cell and/or in heme homeostasis.
