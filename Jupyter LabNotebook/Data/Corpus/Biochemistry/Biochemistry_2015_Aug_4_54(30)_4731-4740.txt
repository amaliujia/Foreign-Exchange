Tau fibrils are the main proteinacious
components of neurofibrillary
lesions in Alzheimer disease. Although RNA molecules are sequestered
into these lesions, their relationship to Tau fibrils is only poorly
understood. Such understanding, however, is important, as short fibrils
can transfer between neurons and nonproteinacious factors including
RNA could play a defining role in modulating the latter process. Here,
we used sedimentation assays combined with electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR), fluorescence, and absorbance spectroscopy to determine the
effects of RNA on Tau fibril structure and growth. We observe that,
in the presence of RNA, three-repeat (3R) and four-repeat (4R) Tau
form fibrils with parallel, in-register arrangement of β-strands
and exhibit an asymmetric seeding barrier in which 4R Tau grows onto
3R Tau seeds but not vice versa. These structural features are similar
to those previously observed for heparin-induced fibrils, indicating
that basic conformational properties are conserved, despite their
being molecular differences of the nucleating agents. Furthermore,
RNA sustains template-assisted growth and binds to the fibril surface
and can be exchanged by heparin. These findings suggest that, in addition
to mediating fibrillization, cofactors decorating the surface of Tau
fibrils may modulate biological interactions and thereby influence
the spreading of Tau pathology in the human brain.

Intracellular
lesions in Alzheimer
disease brain are characterized by neurofibrillary tangles in cell
bodies, neuropil threads in cytoplasmic processes, and dystrophic
neurites around senile plaques.1 All of
these lesions contain Tau fibrils. Recent evidence suggests that the
progression of Tau pathology2,3 could be based on the
cell-to-cell transfer of Tau aggregates via axonally connected neurons.4−6 Once taken up by recipient cells, Tau fibrils are thought to recruit
native, unfolded Tau proteins in a process of template-assisted conversion.7 The molecular mechanism of this process is poorly
understood.

Adult human brain expresses six different Tau isoforms,
ranging
in size from 352 to 441 amino acids, all of which are deposited in
the brains of Alzheimer disease patients.8 The isoforms can be divided into three-repeat (3R) Tau and four-repeat
(4R) Tau based on the number of microtubule binding repeats present.9 The repeats are 31 to 32 amino acids in length
and together constitute the protease-resistant core of the fibril.10−12 The remaining N- and C-terminal residues comprise a fuzzy, unstructured
coat13 that protrudes from the fibril core.14 Removal of these regions results in the truncated
Tau constructs K18 (4R) and K19 (3R)15 that
show greatly accelerated aggregation kinetics.16 Presumably, the N- and C-termini fold back onto the repeat
region,17 preventing self-assembly. Both
truncated and full-length Tau form fibrils with an amyloid-type cross-β
structure, in which β-strands extend perpendicular to the long
fibril axis and are spaced ∼4.7 Å apart.18,19

Fibril assembly is initiated by a critical nucleation step
in which
multiple Tau molecules join into a propagation-competent structure.20 This step is facilitated by negatively charged
cofactors such as heparin,21,22 fatty acids,23,24 and RNA25,26 that act to counter the positive charge
within the repeat region of Tau. In the absence of cofactors, Tau
does not aggregate unless it is used at concentrations far exceeding
cellular levels and subjected to extremes of pH, temperature, or ionic
strength.27,28

It is currently unknown what events
initiate Tau fibrillization
in the cell. Phosphorylation of Tau increases the soluble pool of
the protein based on its lowered affinity to microtubules.29−32 However, whether phosphorylation alone is sufficient to induce fibrillization
remains unresolved. Additional cellular factors, including those that
are applied in vitro, could play a critical role.
Although RNA was found to stimulate Tau aggregation, compared to other
cofactors, its effects on fibril formation are still poorly understood.
Also, despite being sequestered into the fibrillar lesions of Tau
in Alzheimer disease33 and other tauopathies,34 it remains unclear whether RNA binds to fibrils.
Here, we investigated the formation of Tau fibrils in the presence
of RNA. Our findings provide insights into fibril structure and propagation
that could have important implications for the spreading of Tau pathology.

Materials
and Methods
Expression and Purification of Tau
Tau constructs K18
and K19 (in pET28) with their natural cysteines replaced by serines
and single cysteines introduced at positions 309, 310, 311, 317, 322,
and 326 were expressed and purified as previously described.35 Briefly, BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Agilent)
transformed with the appropriate pET28 vectors were grown at 37 °C
to an OD600 of 0.8–1.0. Expression was induced with
1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells
were incubated for 3 1/2 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were then centrifuged
at 3000g for 15 min, and pellets were resuspended
in 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM PIPES (J.T. Baker), 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
pH 6.5, buffer. Bacterial samples were stored at −80 °C
until further use. For purification, bacteria were heated to 80 °C
for 20 min, cooled on ice for 5 min, lysed by 1 min of sonication,
and pelleted at 15 000g for 30 min. Tau-containing
supernatants were precipitated with a 55% w/v addition of ammonium
sulfate. Samples were rocked at 25 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged
at 15 000g for 10 min. Protein pellets were
resuspended in dH2O containing 4 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),
sonicated for 40 s, and syringe-filtered (0.45 μm Acrodisc GxF/GHP
filter (Pall Life Sciences)). The samples were then loaded onto a
Mono S 10/100GL column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a linear 50
mM to 1 M NaCl gradient. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pooled
samples were further purified on a Superdex 200 size exclusion column
(GE Healthcare) using the following elution buffer: 100 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 20 mM Tris at pH 7.4. Monomeric Tau was precipitated
overnight at 4 °C with the addition of a 4-fold volumetric excess
of acetone containing 5 mM DTT. Precipitated Tau was sedimented, washed
with acetone (2 mM DTT), and stored at −80 °C.

Spin Labeling
of Tau Monomer
Precipitated Tau pellets
were dissolved in 200–400 μL of 8 M guanidine hydrochloride.
A ∼10-fold molar excess of [1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl]
methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) spin label (Toronto Research Chemicals,
Downsview, Canada) was added to Tau and allowed to incubate for at
least 1 h. Tau samples were then purified with a PD-10 column (GE
Healthcare) to remove denaturant and unreacted spin label. The elution
buffer consisted of 10 mM HEPES, (J.T. Baker) at pH 7.4 and 100 mM
NaCl. Concentrations of Tau monomers were determined using the BCA
method (Thermo Scientific).

EPR Measurements of Fibrils
Fibrils
were formed by
incubating 35 μM spin-labeled Tau and 70 μg/mL polyA RNA
(Sigma P9403) for 3 days with stirring in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES
buffer at pH 7.4. The RNA was polydisperse (ranging in size from ∼0.2
to 2 kb), as judged by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fibrils were also
prepared with 30–65 μM spin-labeled Tau with polyU (Sigma
P9528), double-stranded polyAU (Sigma P1537), tRNA (Sigma R8759),
or RNA extract from baker’s yeast (Sigma R650) at concentration
ranges of 140–200 μg/mL or with polydA (Sigma P0887)
at 36 μg/mL. Additionally, assembly was performed with a 4-fold
molar excess of polyglutamate (Sigma P1943) or with double-stranded
DNA, circular (pET28) or linear (Sigma D4522), at 100–200 μg/mL.
Notably, in both cases, double-stranded DNA failed to properly induce
fibrillization. Fibrils were pelleted at &gt;100 000g for 30 min. Pellets were washed with buffer, centrifuged
further
for 10 min, and transferred to 0.60 mm i.d. × 0.84 mm o.d. borosilicate
capillaries (VitroCom CV6084-100). Samples were measured by a Bruker
EMX spectrometer fitted with an ER 4119HS resonator using a 12 mW
incident microwave power and 150 G scan width. Spectra were normalized
according to the total number of spins using double integration. A
minor background that resulted from Tau monomers (&lt;2.0 mol %) was
subtracted from all spectra.

Seeding Kinetics
Tau-seeded aggregation
was monitored
using an acrylodan fluorescence assay previously described.36 Fibril seeds were prepared by incubating 25
μM K18 or K19 with 50 μg/mL of polyA RNA in 100 mM NaCl,
10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer for 3 days with stirring. Fibrils were
cooled on ice for 15 min and continuously sonicated for 20 s at power
setting 3 in a Fisher Scientific Sonifier (150 Series) to induce fibril
breakage. Fragmented fibril seeds (10% monomer equivalents) were added
to 10 μM K18 or K19 monomer to initiate aggregation. Monomer
included 98% cysteine-free Tau (cysteines replaced with serines) and
2% Tau labeled at cysteine 310. Reactions included the addition of
20 μg/mL polyA RNA. Aggregation kinetics were measured using
a Fluorolog 3 fluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon). The excitation wavelength
was set at 360 nm, and emission spectra were collected from 400 to
600 nm. The excitation and emission slit widths in these experiments
were 5 nm. To depict seeded growth, the inverse of the emission maxima
were plotted as a function of time.

Successive Seeding
Successive seeding reactions were
carried out with and without the addition of polyA RNA as a cofactor.
Initial reactions (1.4 mL) contained 25 μM K18 or K19 WT, 125
μg/mL RNA, and 10% seeds (monomer equivalents). Reactions proceeded
for 24 h. Five hundred microliters was removed, sonicated on ice,
and used to provide fibril seeds for the following reaction. Each
additional reaction (25 μM Tau monomer) was seeded with 10%
seeds (monomer equivalents) from the previous reaction and was incubated
for 24 h with or without 125 μg/mL polyA RNA. Fibrils from each
reaction were centrifuged at &gt;100 000g for
30 min. Pellets were washed with buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4), centrifuged again for 10 min, taken up in 1× sample
buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol,
0.001% bromophenol blue), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Where appropriate,
bands were quantified by ImageJ.

RNA Binding to Tau Fibrils
and Exchange with Heparin
Tau/RNA fibril seeds were prepared
as described under Seeding Kinetics. Ten
percent seeds (monomer equivalents)
was added to 25 μM K18 or K19 monomer with 50 μg/mL polyA
RNA in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, buffer. Samples were inverted
three times and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Fibrils were centrifuged
at &gt;100 000g for 30 min, and pellets were
dissolved in 60 μL of 2% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate. To supernatants
was added 60 μL of 2% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate, and both pellets
and supernatants were brought to 1250 μL with buffer. RNA contained
in pellets was determined at Abs260 using a Cary 100 Bio
UV–visible spectrophotometer. In heparin exchange experiments,
fibrils were formed with RNA and K18 or K19 Tau as before. Heparin
(average MW = 4400, Celsus, EN-3225) or fluorescently conjugated heparin
(average MW = 18 000, Invitrogen, H7482) was then added for
final concentrations of 50 and 2.5 μM, respectively. On the
basis of the RNA size distribution (0.2–2 kb), these concentrations
corresponded to a ∼66–660-fold molar excess of Celsus-heparin
over RNA and a ∼3.3–33-fold molar excess of Invitrogen-heparin
over RNA. It is likely that the molecular weight of heparin affects
its binding affinity to Tau fibrils, with higher molecular weight
species exhibiting increased affinity. However, since heparin is also
inherently heterogeneous (the commercial forms are isolated from porcine
intestinal mucosa), the specific sugar composition and the particular
pattern of sulfonation will affect fibril binding as well. Similar
arguments will apply for binding of Tau fibrils to heparan sulfate
proteoglycans on the cell surface (see Discussion). Samples were inverted five times and incubated 24 h at 37 °C.
Subsequently, fibrils were sedimented and resuspended as before. Absorbance
of fluorescent heparin was determined in both pellet and supernatant
at 490 nm. RNA present was determined by absorbance at 260 nm, with
minor contributions from fluorescent heparin subtracted.

Binding of
Heparin to Fibrils Detected by Anisotropy Measurements
Binding
of fluorescein-conjugated heparin to Tau/RNA fibrils was
monitored in a Fluorolog 3 fluorometer equipped with automated dual
polarizers (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) at an excitation wavelength of 480
nm and emission wavelength of 516 nm, with slitwidths set at 4 and
8 nm, respectively. The G-factor was determined according
to G = IHV/IHH, where IHV and IHH are the vertically and horizontally polarized
emissions when the sample is excited with horizontally polarized light.
The anisotropy (r) was computed by the fluorometer
software according to r = (IVV – GIVH)/(IVV + 2GIVH).37 Integration times were 0.1 s. Baseline anisotropy was measured
with fluorescent heparin alone (in 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,
buffered solution). Fibrils were then added to heparin for final concentrations
of 6 μM Tau fibrils (monomer equivalents) and 40 nM heparin
with a final volume of 500 μL. All measurements were performed
at 37 °C.

Negative Stain Electron Microscopy (EM)
To confirm
the fibrillar nature of the Tau aggregates, 250-mesh carbon-coated
copper grids were placed for 40 s onto 10 μM Tau protein, stained
for 30 s with 2% uranyl acetate, and then air-dried on filter paper.
The samples were examined with a Philips/FEI Tecnai-12 electron transmission
microscope at 80 keV.

Results
Tau Fibril Structure
A first step in the fibrillization
of Tau is the formation of a multimeric nucleus.20,38,39 In this step, negatively charged cofactors
are thought to induce conformational changes in the intrinsically
disordered Tau monomers40 and to increase
the local Tau concentration by simultaneously binding to multiple
positively charged monomers.25 We previously
showed that fibrils formed in the presence of heparin assume a parallel,
in-register β-sheet structure.35,41 Since cofactors
play a critical role in fibril nucleation, an important, yet unanswered,
question is whether these auxiliary factors modulate overall fibril
structure. In order to address this question, we first examined whether
substitution of heparin by RNA affects β-strand arrangement
and registry. For this purpose, six single-cysteine mutants of K18
and K19 (cysteines in positions 309, 310, 311, 317, 322, and 326)
were labeled with the paramagnetic nitroxide label MTSL.42 The sites were chosen to represent the stable
core of the third microtubule binding repeat, which is critical for
fibril formation.43 Spin-labeled Tau was
allowed to aggregate in the presence of RNA (polyA) for 3 days under
agitation (see Materials and Methods). Continuous-wave
EPR measurements produced single-line spectra for all fibrils (Figure 1A). The collapse
of the three-line spectra that are normally observed for MTSL-labeled
proteins can be explained by the exchange interaction between multiple
spin labels. This is achieved by parallel, in-register arrangement
of β-strands in which labels attached to identical positions
in different Tau molecules are stacked along the fibril axis.44 Fibrils formed in the presence of other RNA
species such as polyU, double-stranded RNA (UA), tRNA, and whole yeast
RNA extract produced similar results (Figure 1B). Also, different negatively charged polymers
such as single-stranded DNA and polyglutamate produced fibrils that
resulted in similar single-line characteristics (Figure 1C). Combined, these data suggest
that the parallel, in-register arrangement of β-strands is a
common feature of Tau fibrils, independent of the cofactor that is
used to induce aggregation.

Figure 1 EPR analysis of Tau fibrils. Single cysteines
in K18 and K19 monomers
were spin-labeled with the nitroxide label MTSL and allowed to fibrillize
in the presence of polyanionic cofactors. All spectra were taken at
150 G and normalized to the same number of spins. K18 and K19 fibrils
were formed in the presence of (A) polyA, (B) polyU, polyAU, tRNA,
and yeast RNA extract, and (C) polydA and polyGlu. The single-line
EPR spectra observed for all fibrils indicate that, regardless of
cofactor, β-strands in the proteins are aligned parallel and
in-register.

Asymmetric Seeding Barrier
Despite the structural commonalities,
packing interactions between β-sheets could vary substantially,
resulting in different overall conformations. Indeed, K18 and K19
fibrils, both of which (in the presence of heparin) form parallel,
in-register β-strands,35 are conformationally
distinct.45 In order to gain further insights
into the structure of RNA-induced fibrils, we next investigated their
seeding properties. Since RNA interferes with the commonly used thioflavin
assays of Tau fibril formation,46 we chose
an acrylodan-based fluorescence assay to monitor seeded fibril growth.36 In this assay, acrylodan is attached to a single
cysteine of the protein and fibril assembly is observed through the
blueshift in the fluorescence emission maximum that occurs when the
label moves from an aqueous environment in the disordered monomer
to a hydrophobic environment in the folded fibril. First, K18 and
K19 monomers were individually labeled at position 310 and mixed with
their respective cysteine-free counterparts (molar ratio of 1:50).
These mixtures were then combined with 10 mol % seeds (monomer equivalents)
of K18 and K19. Samples were excited at 360 nm, and inverse emission
maxima were plotted as a function of time (Figure 2). While K18 monomers grow onto K18 seeds,
K19 monomers do not (Figure 2A). K19 seeds, however, facilitate growth of both K19 and
K18 monomers, although the latter monomers grow less efficiently (Figure 2B). The data indicate
that the previously observed asymmetric seeding barrier for heparin-mediated
fibril growth is also preserved for fibrils formed in the presence
of RNA. Furthermore, the data suggest that important structural properties
of the fibrils are conserved.

Figure 2 Seeding properties of 3R and 4R Tau. Tau fibril
seeds (10% monomer
equivalents) were mixed with monomers of K18 and K19 (98% cysteine
free, 2% acrylodan labeled at position 310). As the labeled Tau monomers
incorporate into the fibrils, the emission maxima shift to the blue.
Inverse emission maxima plotted against time depict fibril growth:
(A) K18 seeded growth and (B) K19 seeded growth. Values represent
mean ± SD (n = 3 experiments). Tau concentration,
10 μM; cofactor, 20 μg/mL polyA RNA; excitation, 360 nm.
An asymmetric seeding barrier prevents 3R Tau from growing onto 4R
Tau seeds but not vice versa.

RNA Sustains Fibril Growth
Although it is clear that
RNA is needed for nucleation, its role in fibril growth is not established.
Here, we asked whether Tau fibril propagation could be sustained if
RNA was omitted in consecutive cycles of seeding. The overall design
of these experiments is outlined schematically in Figure 3A. Tau fibrils were first grown
in a seeded reaction that included cofactor (cycle 1, Figure 3A). These fibrils were then
sonicated and subjected to four consecutive cycles of seeding with
cofactor either present or absent (cycle 2–5, Figure 3A). After each cycle, the samples
were divided into two fractions: one for seed production via sonication
and another for fibril sedimentation and SDS-PAGE analysis. The Coomassie-stained
gels revealed that K18 and K19 fibrils propagated in the presence
of RNA with similar amounts of fibril mass produced in each cycle
(Figure 3B, left panels).
When RNA was omitted during the elongation steps, fibril formation
ceased (Figure 3B,
right panels). The weak bands observed for cycles 2 and 3 (respective
intensities of 24 and 2.0% for K18 and 24 and 2.1% for K19) are due
to the seeds that were added to the reactions, and in the case of
cycle 2, some residual aggregation as cofactor was carried over from
cycle 1. The results demonstrate that RNA drives the amplification
of Tau fibrils.

Figure 3 RNA sustains template-assisted fibril growth of 3R and
4R Tau.
(A) Schematic diagram illustrating consecutive cycles of seeding and
growth used in the experiment below. Beginning with cycle 2, RNA was
omitted from all reactions. Only control experiments contained RNA
throughout. After each cycle (24 h of growth at 22 °C), fibrils
were sedimented by ultracentrifugation (100 000g) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. (B) Fibril growth
in the presence (left panel) and absence (right panel) of polyA RNA:
upper panels, K18; lower panels, K19. Each reaction contained 10%
seeds and 25 μM Tau. PolyA RNA, 125 μg/mL. (C, D) Tau
fibril seeds (10% monomer equivalents) were mixed with K18 and K19
monomers (98% cysteine free, 2% acrylodan-labeled at position 310).
(C) K18 growth onto K18 seeds in the presence and absence of RNA.
(D) K19 growth onto K19 seeds in the presence and absence of RNA.
The data demonstrate that RNA sustains template-assisted fibril growth.

In order to gain additional support
for cofactor-mediated fibril
growth, we directly monitored the incorporation of Tau monomers into
preformed fibrils using the acrylodan-based seeding assay from above.
Specifically, K18 and K19 fibrils were formed in the presence of RNA
and upon shearing were used as seeds for fibril propagation. In the
presence of RNA, Tau monomers faithfully incorporated into the seeds
(Figure 3C,D). These
data agree with our previous observations (Figure 2) and are plotted for reference purposes
only. Importantly, in the absence of RNA, no incorporation occurred
(Figure 3C,D).

RNA Binding
Next, we asked whether RNA physically associates
with Tau fibrils or whether the interactions are of transient nature.
For this purpose, K18 and K19 fibrils were formed in the presence
of polyA with 10% fibril seeds present to expedite aggregation. After
sedimentation, the pellets were dissolved in buffer containing 2%
SDS. The supernatants were adjusted to the same SDS concentration
as that of the pellets. Absorption spectra were taken of the supernatant,
the solubilized pellets, and control samples that contained RNA only
(Figure 4A,C). The
absorption maxima at 260 nm are indicative of RNA. The protein itself
has negligible absorbance at this wavelength, as it harbors only a
single aromatic tyrosine. Quantification of three independent experiments
for each K18 and K19 seeded growth reveals that the majority of RNA
(∼90%) became incorporated into the fibrils (Figure 4B,D). On the basis of the size
distribution of RNA (0.2–2 kb), one RNA molecule bound to ∼40–400
Tau molecules. Notably, dilution of Tau fibrils into buffer lacking
RNA did not lead to the dissociation of Tau fibrils (Figure S1A). Furthermore, elevated concentrations of salt
(500 mM NaCl) caused only minor dissociation of RNA (Figure S1B) and had no effect on fibril mass (Figure S1C). The findings suggest that RNA is
firmly associated with the fibrils.

Figure 4 RNA binds to Tau fibrils. K18 and K19
fibrils were formed for 2
h at 37 °C from a mixture of Tau monomers (25 μM), respective
seeds (10%), and polyA RNA (50 μg/mL). (A) Absorption spectra
of solubilized K18 pellets (red), supernatants (blue), and total RNA
(black). (B) Corresponding normalized intensities for experiments
performed in triplicate. (C) Absorption spectra of solubilized K19
pellets, supernatant, and total RNA (color coding as above). (D) Corresponding
normalized intensities for experiments performed in triplicate. Values
represent mean ± SD. The data indicate that the majority of RNA
is associated with K18 and K19 fibrils.

Cofactor Exchange
The question arose as to whether
RNA/Tau fibril interactions could be perturbed by polyanions. We hypothesized
that heparin, a polysulfonated glycosaminoglycan, might affect the
interactions by competing for binding sites. In order to test this
hypothesis, we added a 2-fold molar excess of heparin (based on the
concentration of Tau monomers) to preformed K18/RNA fibrils. After
incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, RNA had almost completely transferred
into the supernatant (Figure 5A). The filamentous nature of K18 fibrils before and after
the addition of heparin was verified by negative stain transmission
electron microscopy (Figure 5B,C). Next, an equivalent set of experiments was carried out
with K19 fibrils. Again, addition of heparin caused transfer of RNA
into the supernatant (Figure 5D), although, in this case, transfer was less efficient. Importantly,
in the absence of heparin, RNA was almost exclusively found in the
pellet (Figure 4).
The addition of heparin to K19/RNA fibrils did not affect the filamentous
nature of the fibrils (compare Figure 5E with Figure 5F). The data indicate that heparin causes the release of RNA
from Tau fibrils.

Figure 5 RNA dissociates from Tau fibrils. K18 and K19 fibrils
(25 μM
monomer added to 10% seeds) were grown in the presence of RNA (50
μg/mL) and subsequently incubated for 24 h with heparin (50
μM). (A) Normalized absorbance at 260 nm for solubilized K18
pellet and supernatant. (B) K18/RNA fibrils. (C) K18/heparin fibrils

solubilized K19 pellet and supernatant. (E) K19/RNA fibrils. (F) K19/heparin
fibrils after heparin/RNA exchange. Intensities represent mean ±
SD (n = 3 experiments). Bar, 400 nm. The data suggest
that heparin replaces the majority of RNA that is bound to K18 and
K19 fibrils.

Since heparin does not
absorb in the visible spectrum, it remained
unclear whether heparin had replaced RNA on the fibril. To address
this question, we added fluorescein-conjugated heparin to Tau/RNA
fibrils and incubated the samples for 24 h at 37 °C. As before,
pellets and supernatants were adjusted to the same volume containing
2% SDS (which solubilizes the fibrils). The absorbance at 260 nm revealed
that the majority of RNA was released from K18 and K19 fibrils (Figure 6A,B). The results
are similar to those obtained for nonconjugated heparin (Figure 5A,D), suggesting
that the fluorescein modification and the change in average molecular
weight (see Materials and Methods) did not
affect the ability of heparin to release RNA from the Tau fibril cores.
Notice that, again, the release of RNA from K19 fibrils was less efficient
than that from K18 fibrils. This could reflect differences in RNA
binding between the conformationally distinct fibrils. Specifically,
some of the RNA binding sites in K19 fibrils might be in the interior
rather than on the surface. Conjugated heparin was detected by measuring
the absorbance at 490 nm. Importantly, the majority of heparin (∼80%)
associated with the K18 and K19 fibrils (Figure 6C,D). In both cases, the molar ratio of heparin
to Tau was approximately 1:13.

Figure 6 Heparin replaces RNA on Tau fibrils. K18
and K19 fibrils (25 μM
monomer added to 10% seeds) were grown in the presence of RNA (50
μg/mL) and subsequently incubated for 24 h with fluorescein-conjugated
heparin (2.5 μM). (A, B) Normalized absorbance at 260 nm for
solubilized K18 and K19 pellets and supernatants. (C, D) Normalized
absorbance at 490 nm for solubilized K18 and K19 pellets and supernatants.

concentration, 6 μM; heparin concentration, 40 nM; excitation,
480 nm; emission, 516 nm. Arrows mark additions of Tau fibrils or
Tau monomers to fluorescein-conjugated heparin. The large changes
in fluorescence anisotropy observed in E and F imply that heparin
binds to Tau fibrils.

In a last set of experiments, we sought to monitor heparin-to-fibril
binding in real time. We reasoned that the tumbling of conjugated
heparin would decrease as it bound to Tau fibrils. The fluorescence
anisotropy of conjugated heparin was monitored as a function of time.
The addition of K18/RNA and K19/RNA fibrils resulted in a steady increase
in fluorescence anisotropy (Figure 6E,F), suggesting that the cofactor had associated with
the fibrils. To ensure that the increase in anisotropy was not the
result of heparin binding to residual K18 and K19 monomers, we monitored
the anisotropy changes in the presence of K18 and K19 monomers alone.
Only small increases in anisotropy were observed (Figure 6G,H). Combined, these findings
demonstrate that heparin binds to Tau fibrils and replaces RNA on
the fibril surface.

Discussion
Neurofibrillary lesions
composed of the microtubule associated
protein Tau are a defining hallmark of Alzheimer disease and other
Tauopathies. Although RNA was already identified in the late 90s to
be a major nonproteinaceous component of these lesions33,34 and was shown to stimulate Tau fibril formation in vitro,25,26 it remained unknown whether RNA physically
associates with Tau fibrils. In this study, we investigated the RNA/Tau
interaction and examined the effects of RNA on fibril conformation
and growth.

We observed that fibrils formed in the presence
of different RNA
species (as well as DNA and polyglutamate) assume a parallel, in-register
arrangement of β-strands. This structure was previously observed
for Tau fibrils formed in the presence of heparin,35 suggesting that the strand arrangement is a conserved property
of Tau fibrils that is not modulated by inducers. We furthermore identified
an asymmetric seeding barrier in which 4R Tau grows onto 3R Tau seeds
but not vice versa. The existence of a similar barrier for RNA- (this
study) and heparin-induced Tau fibrils36 indicates that the lateral associations between β-sheets in
these fibrils are similar. The findings are remarkable considering
that the nucleating agents are molecularly distinct and that Tau monomers
exhibit a high degree of conformational plasticity.36,47 They suggest that two key features of the fibril structure are preserved:
(1) strand arrangement, which reflects interactions parallel to the
long fibril axis, and (2) β-sheet packing, which reflects interactions
perpendicular to the fibril axis. However, since differently packed
conformers in an ensemble of 4R Tau fibrils could produce the same
seeding barrier,45,48 the relative populations of conformers
could vary in a cofactor-dependent manner.

Our experiments on
template-assisted growth demonstrate that RNA
is required for the recruitment of Tau monomers onto seeds. The specific
role RNA plays in this process remains unclear. Although Tau monomers
are intrinsically disordered, long-range interactions within the protein
could lower the accessibility to the repeats and hence prevent docking
of the monomers to the fibril ends. Specifically, it has been recognized
that the N- and C-termini of Tau might interact with residues in the
third microtubule binding repeat. These interactions produce discontinuous
epitopes that are recognized by the antibodies Alz-50 and MC-1.49 Further support for this double-hairpin (or
paperclip) model was provided by FRET measurements in which donor
and acceptor fluorophores in the repeats and in the termini came into
close proximity.17 NMR experiments provided
a refined model in which an intricate network of transient long-range
interactions establishes a dynamic structural ensemble of loosely
packed Tau monomers.50 The binding of cofactors
could have a direct effect on these ensembles. In support of this,
heparin was observed to compact the microtubule binding domain and
to break long-range interactions that could prevent sampling of aggregation-competent
conformers.51 However, since in the current
study only truncated Tau, which lacks the N- and C-termini, was used,
it is unlikely that conformational changes alone can explain the cofactor
dependence on growth. Alternatively, the cofactor could lower the
activation barrier of docking, allowing positively charged side chains
in the repeat region to stack. Additionally, the cofactor could stabilize
the growing fibril by directly binding to its surface. In support
of this, we found that RNA associates with fibrils.

If RNA molecules
bound parallel to the long fibril axis, as has
been proposed for heparin,52 then a single
nucleic acid molecule, depending on polymer length, could associate
with tens or hundreds of layers of Tau proteins. This could compensate
the charge repulsions between protruding lysines that are stacked
in the parallel, in-register structure of the fibril. Even minor (substoichiometric)
incorporation of cofactors12,38,53 could hence result in major reinforcement of the fibril structure.
Importantly, a fibril-stabilizing function of cofactor has recently
been observed for heparin.54 The specific
effects cofactors assert on fibril stability are most likely dependent
on polymer length and type. Whether cofactor is needed to stabilize
Tau fibrils could also be dependent on conformation. Indeed, the Tau
disease mutant ΔK280,55 which forms
fibrils that are structurally distinct from those of wild-type Tau,56 does not require cofactor for fibrillization.12

Regardless of the stabilizing role of
cofactors, the decoration
of Tau fibrils with nonproteinacious molecules could encode important
biological information. The nature of the cofactor on the surface
of the fibril could influence how the fibril interacts with cellular
components. The uptake of Tau fibrils, for example, is, at least in
part, mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).57 The efficiency of this process could depend
on the accessibility of binding sites and the particular nature of
the cofactors that decorate the fibril. We observed that heparin replaces
RNA on the fibril surface. A similar mechanism could facilitate fibril
binding to HSPGs on the cell surface. Exchangeable cofactors on the
surface of Tau fibrils may enhance fibril transmission between neurons,
whereas nonexchangeable ones may inhibit it. A new intricate model
emerges in which cofactors not only sustain template-assisted growth
but also are part of the fibril structure (Figure 7). In some fibrils, cofactors may be not
only bound to the surface but also incorporated into the amyloidogenic
core. The K19 fibrils that were characterized in this study may be
one example. In these fibrils, a significant population of RNA molecules
could not be replaced by heparin (Figures 5 and 6).

Figure 7 Schematic model
for cofactor participation in Tau fibril growth
and decoration. RNA (blue) not only sustains template-assisted growth
but also decorates the fibril surface. Heparin (red) can substitute
RNA on the surface and thereby change the properties of the fibril.
Different conformers of Tau fibrils (squares, triangles, and hexagons)
will have distinct associations. The decoration of Tau fibrils with
other cofactors (not shown) could produce a complex structural ensemble
with diverse biological activities.

The molecular species that decorate the surface of Tau fibrils in vivo may depend on multiple factors including fibril
conformation, localization, cell type, and metabolic state. It is
notable that approximately 20% of the Tau lesions in the hippocampal
and entorhinal regions of Alzheimer disease brain does not contain
RNA.33 Associations with other cofactors58−61 are a plausible explanation.

The template-assisted conversion
of Tau exhibits remarkable similarities
to the conversion of prion proteins,62,63 where RNA,64,65 HSPGs,66 lipids,67,68 and combinations of cofactors68,69 are found to stimulate
conformational transitions. These similarities underscore common molecular
mechanisms in the propagation of the misfolded species. A detailed
understanding of the Tau/cofactor interactions and their biological
consequences could be critical for interfering with the intracerebral
spreading of Tau pathology.
