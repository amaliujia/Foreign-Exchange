Aggregations of denaturing proteins in the presence of
mini-αA-chaperone
or chimeric mini-chaperone (CP1). (A) Heat- and EDTA-induced ADH (5
μM) aggregation in the presence of mini-αA (40 μM)
or mini-αA (Δ87–88, 40 μM) at 37 °C.
(B) Heat-induced citrate synthase (4 μM) aggregation assay at
43 °C in the presence of mini-αA (40 μM) or CP1 (40
μM). (C) ADH (5 μM) aggregation in the presence of mini-αA
(40 μM) or CP1 (40 μM). (D) Chaperone-like activity of
mini-αA or CP1 peptide toward DDT-induced aggregation of LA
at 37 °C.
