The P-glycoprotein drug pump
(P-gp, ABCB1) catalyzes the ATP-dependent efflux of a wide range of
hydrophobic compounds.− The 1280 amino acids of human P-gp are organized as two tandem repeats that are joined by
a linker region. Each repeat consists of an NH2-terminal
transmembrane domain (TMD) containing six transmembrane (TM) segments
followed by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD).

There is a considerable
degree of cross talk between the TMDs and
NBDs during the reaction cycle as drug binding activates ATPase activity
and ATP hydrolysis leads to efflux of the drug from the TMDs. Although
there is no high-resolution crystal structure of human P-gp, homology
models− based on the crystal structures of P-gps from Caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, or bacterial Sav1866 showed that the TMDs were connected to the NBDs by four intracellular
loops (ICLs). The ICLs were proposed to act as “ball-and-socket”
joints to connect the TMDs to the NBDs and act as transmission interfaces. ICL1
(TMD1–NBD1), ICL2 (TMD1–NBD2), ICL3 (TMD2–NBD2),
and ICL4 (TMD1–NBD2) mediate linkages between domains. The
crystal structure of C. elegans P-gp predicted that
the most important connections between the TMDs and NBDs in human
P-gp would involve ICL2 as 14 amino acids in this loop were predicted
to connect TMD1 to NBD2 via salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, or van der
Waals interactions. The structure of ICL2 appears to be critical for
biosynthesis of P-gp as point mutations in this region inhibit maturation.

An accurate model of human P-gp is important
for understanding
its mechanism and for in silico docking studies for
the discovery of novel inhibitors.,, Homology models of human P-gp based on the mouse
and C. elegans crystal structures generally yielded
similar structures., There was, however, a significant
difference in the structure of ICL2. ICL2 connects TM segments 4 and
5 (Figure A). ICL2 appears to play a key role
in coupling NBD1–TMD2 interactions because cysteines introduced
into ICL2 (A266C) and NBD2 (F1086C) could be cross-linked and the
F1086C change abolished activity. While
both structures predict that residues 261–267 form an interhelical
loop (IH2) (forms the ball portion of the ball-and-socket ICL2–NBD
connection), adjacent amino acids were predicted to adopt loop or
α-helical structures in the mouse or C. elegans structures, respectively. The difference is significant because
only the C. elegans model suggests the presence of
a salt bridge between Glu256 and Arg276. Here, we tested whether the
Glu256–Arg276 salt bridge plays an important role in P-gp folding.

The amino acid sequences
of human, mouse, and C. elegans are similar (Figure B). Homology models
of human P-gp based on the mouse or C. elegans structure,
however, predict quite different structures for the ICL2 segments
(residues Val253–Ala259 and Gly269–Lys272) that flank
IH2 (residues Arg262–Phe267) (Figure C,D). The mouse-based homology model predicts that the Val253–Ala259
and Gly269–Lys272 segments would be loops (Figure C), whereas the C. elegans-based
model predicts that these segments would be present as α-helices
(Figure D). One critical structural difference
between the two models is that only the C. elegans-based model predicts that Glu256 forms a salt bridge with Arg276
(Figure D).

We predicted that a salt
bridge between residues Glu256 and Arg276
might be an important structural determinant for folding of P-gp because
mutational analysis of ICL2 suggests that it plays a key role in folding
of human P-gp. For example, mutation of glycine residues in the ICLs showed that Gly to Val changes at positions
251, 268, and 269 in ICL2 inhibited folding and maturation of P-gp
from the core-glycosylated form (150 kDa) in the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) to the mature (170 kDa) protein containing complex carbohydrates.
By contrast, none of the Gly mutations in ICL1, -3, or -4 inhibited
maturation.

To test if the charged
amino acids Glu256 and Arg276 were important
for maturation, we characterized mutants E256A and R276A. Figure E shows that E256A or R276A mutations inhibited
maturation. While the mature 170 kDa protein was the major product
of wild-type P-gp, the immature 150 kDa protein was the major product
of mutants E256A and R276A.

We then tested whether mutations
of other charged amino acids in
the ICL2 segment between Val253 and Arg276 also inhibited maturation
of P-gp (Glu255, Lys271, Lys272, Glu273, and Glu275). It was found
that the E255A, K271A, K272A, E273A, and E275A mutants were different
from the E256A and R276A mutants because they yielded mature 170 kDa
P-gp as their major product (Figure E). The
results in Figure E suggest that interactions
between Glu256 and Arg276 were important for maturation of P-gp.

If a salt bridge between Glu256 and Arg276 were important for the
maturation of human P-gp, it would be expected that an E256R/R276E
mutant would still mature. Accordingly, we reversed the positions
of the glutamic acid and arginine residues (E256R/R276E) and tested
the mutant’s ability to undergo maturation. The mature 170
kDa P-gp protein was the major product in mutant E256R/R276E (Figure A). The 170 kDa protein was resistant to treatment
with endoglycosidase H but sensitive to treatment with PNGase F (Figure B). The E256R or R276E mutation, however, inhibited
maturation of P-gp (Figure A). For example,
Figure B shows that the 150 kDa E256R protein
was sensitive to treatment with endoglycosidase H or PNGase F. Similar
results were obtained when mutant R276E was treated with endoglycosidase
H or PNGase F (data not shown). These results suggest a salt bridge
between residues 256 and 276 promoted P-gp maturation.

Reversal of the Glu256
and Arg276 positions yields a mature and
active P-gp. (A) Whole cell sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) extracts
of wild-type P-gp and mutants E256R, R276E, and E256R/R276E. (B) Whole
cell SDS extracts described above treated with endoglycosidase H (H)
or PNGase F (F) and samples subjected to immunoblot analysis. (C)
ATPase activities measured in the presence of various concentrations
of verapamil.

To test if mutant E256R/R276E
yielded an active protein, the histidine-tagged
mutant was expressed in HEK293 cells, isolated by nickel chelate chromatography,
and assayed for verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity. Verapamil was
used because it is transported by P-gp and strongly stimulates (&gt;10-fold) the ATPase activity of human
P-gp. The E256R/R276E mutant showed verapamil-stimulated
ATPase activity that was similar to that of the wild-type protein
(Figure C). The results suggest that the structure
of the regions flanking IH2 is consistent with the structure of C. elegans P-gp (Figure D) and that
interaction between residues 256 and 276 is critical for the synthesis
of the protein.

Is a salt bridge between residues 256 and 276
essential for activity?
To address this question, we first tested whether it was possible
to promote maturation of the E256A or R276A mutant. We previously
showed that P-gp was inactive when it was trapped in the ER as a core-glycosylated
intermediate. Drug substrates (e.g.,
cyclosporine A) can promote maturation of P-gp processing mutants.

Mutants E256A and R276A were expressed
in HEK293 cells in the presence
or absence of 10 μM cyclosporine A. Samples of whole cell sodium
dodecyl sulfate extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. It
was observed that the presence of 10 μM cyclosporine A promoted
maturation of both mutants to yield the mature form of P-gp as the
major product (Figure S1A of the ). The putative Glu256–Arg276 salt bridge was not essential
for activity as both the E256A and R276A mutants showed wild-type
verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity (Figure S1B of the ).

In this study,
we provide biochemical evidence that the structure
of ICL2 in human P-gp resembles the crystal structure of C.
elegans, rather than that of mouse P-gp. The presence of
a salt bridge between Glu256 and Arg276 was found to promote maturation
of human P-gp. Only the C. elegans P-gp structure
predicted that these residues would be close enough to interact. The
presence of a Glu256–Arg276 salt bridge in ICL2 may promote
enhanced folding of P-gp during synthesis in the ER.

Residues
Glu256 and Arg276 in human P-gp are also conserved in
mouse (Glu252 and Arg272, respectively) and C. elegans (Glu280 and Arg300, respectively) P-gps. The C. elegans P-gp structure shows that Glu280 and Arg300 could form a salt bridge
(Figure D). Although the side chains of mouse
P-gp (Glu252 and Arg272) are not in the proper orientation (Figure C) to form a salt bridge, they may still form a
salt bridge under more dynamic, physiological conditions. The distance
between the α-carbons of Glu252 and Arg272 in mouse P-gp is actually shorter (11.4 Å) than the distance
between the α-carbons of Glu280 and Arg300 in C. elegans P-gp (12.3 Å).

How might a Glu256–Arg276 salt
bridge promote folding of
human P-gp? One possibility is that it promotes packing of the TM
segments because ICL2 links TM segments 4 and 5. In support of this
hypothesis, we previously reported that a W232R mutation in TM4 appears
to act as a suppressor mutation to rescue P-gp processing mutants
through hydrogen bond interactions with Asn296 in TM5. Processing mutations likely trap polytopic membrane
proteins like P-gp and CFTR in protease-sensitive conformations with
incomplete packing of the TM segments., Suppressor
mutations in the TMDs can rescue P-gp processing mutants by promoting
packing of the TM segments.,

The Sav1866 bacterial
drug pump contains the equivalent glutamate
(Glu205), but the arginine residue is not conserved (Asn225). Although the distances between the α-carbons
of Glu205 and Asn225 (11.4 A) are similar to those of mammalian P-gp,
a salt bridge may not be necessary for folding of Sav1866. This may
be due to differences in the bacterial and eukaryotic folding pathways.
