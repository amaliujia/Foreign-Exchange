Human NEMO (NF-κB
essential modulator) is a 419 residue scaffolding
protein that, together with catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ,
forms the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, a key regulator of NF-κB
pathway signaling. NEMO is an elongated homodimer comprising mostly
α-helix. It has been shown that a NEMO fragment spanning residues
44–111, which contains the IKKα/β binding site,
is structurally disordered in the absence of bound IKKβ. Herein
we show that enforcing dimerization of NEMO1–120 or NEMO44–111 constructs through introduction
of one or two interchain disulfide bonds, through oxidation of the
native Cys54 residue and/or at position 107 through a Leu107Cys mutation,
induces a stable α-helical coiled-coil structure that is preorganized
to bind IKKβ with high affinity. Chemical and thermal denaturation
studies showed that, in the context of a covalent dimer, the ordered
structure was stabilized relative to the denatured state by up to
3 kcal/mol. A full-length NEMO-L107C protein formed covalent dimers
upon treatment of mammalian cells with H2O2.
Furthermore, NEMO-L107C bound endogenous IKKβ in A293T cells,
reconstituted TNF-induced NF-κB signaling in NEMO-deficient
cells, and interacted with TRAF6. Our results indicate that the IKKβ
binding domain of NEMO possesses an ordered structure in the unbound
state, provided that it is constrained within a dimer as is the case
in the constitutively dimeric full-length NEMO protein. The stability
of the NEMO coiled coil is maintained by strong interhelix interactions
in the region centered on residue 54. The disulfide-linked constructs
we describe herein may be useful for crystallization of NEMO’s
IKKβ binding domain in the absence of bound IKKβ, thereby
facilitating the structural characterization of small-molecule inhibitors.

The cytoplasmic
scaffolding
protein NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), also known as IκB
kinase γ (IKKγ), is a compelling but also a challenging
target for drug discovery.1 In complex
with the catalytic IKKα and IKKβ proteins, NEMO forms
the active kinase IκB kinase (IKK), which performs a key role
in activating NF-κB pathway signaling.2 IKK phosphorylates IκB and triggers its proteolytic degradation,
allowing transcription factor NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus
where it modulates expression of biological effector genes.3,4 NF-κB pathway signaling is a major regulator of many important
biological processes, including cell proliferation, cell survival,
and elements of the immune response, and is considered a drug target
for a range of pathologies including inflammation5 and several kinds of cancer.6 A peptide derived from the NEMO binding domain (NBD) of IKKβ
has been used in multiple studies to show that inhibition of the interaction
of NEMO with IKKα/β can block cytokine-induced NF-κB
activation, NF-κB-dependent gene expression and inflammation
in animal models.7−10 Thus, developing pharmaceutically useful inhibitors that bind to
NEMO and block its interaction with IKKα/β is of interest
as a therapeutic strategy.

Human NEMO is a 419 amino acid protein
that contains five main
domains: helix 1 (HLX1, sometimes called “coiled-coil 1”),
helix 2 (HLX2), a coiled-coil domain (CC), a leucine zipper domain
(LZ), and a C-terminal zinc finger (ZF), as illustrated in Figure 1A. Although the stoichiometry of active NEMO in vivo has been the subject of considerable debate,11−14 most available data now point to a NEMO homodimer as the primary
functional form of the protein.15,16 There is strong evidence
that the NEMO dimer adopts a highly extended structure,14 and NEMO has been proposed to interact with
a number of various proteins at different sites along its length.17−19 Although no crystal structure has yet been reported for full-length
NEMO, some of these interactions have been characterized in atomic
detail through generation of X-ray cocrystal structures of the binding
partner with a fragment of NEMO (Figure 1B).16,20,21 In one such structure, it was
shown that the NEMO binding domain of IKKβ (residues 701–745)
interacts with the region of NEMO extending from approximately residues
44–111, within the helix 1 domain.16 The structure shows that, in complex with a 44-mer peptide derived
from IKKβ, NEMO44–111 exists as an α-helical
coiled coil that binds two molecules of IKKβ, one on each face
of the symmetric NEMO dimer (Figure 1B). We
have recently shown that interactions along the length of IKKβ701–745 contribute to NEMO binding. These studies confirmed
and extended previous reports by showing that IKKβ residues
734–742 occupy the major binding energy hot spot on NEMO,7 and identified two additional regions within
IKKβ701–745 that are critical for high affinity
binding to NEMO.22

Figure 1 Domain structure of NEMO.
(A) Schematic representation of the structure
of human NEMO, showing the named domains helix 1 (HLX1), helix 2 (HLX2),
coiled-coil (CC), leucine zipper (LZ), and zinc finger (ZF). Also
shown are the locations of NEMO’s 11 cysteine residues (identified
by residue number above the cartoon), and of Leu107 which we mutated
to cysteine in some NEMO constructs. The binding site locations for
selected NEMO ligands are indicated by colored bars under the cartoon.
(B) Regions of NEMO that have been characterized crystallographically:
NEMO44–111 in complex with IKKβ peptide (PDB: 3BRV);16 NEMO150–272 in complex with vFlip (PDB: 3CL3);20 NEMO252–336 in complex with diubiquitin
(PDB: 2ZVN);42 and NEMO397–417 (PDB: 2JVX).58 Regions for which no structure has been reported are shown
as a string of dots (one dot per ∼5 amino acids). Below is
shown a close-up view of the 2:2 complex of NEMO44–111 (green) with IKKβ701–745 (orange) from Rushe
et al.16

Despite interest in the NEMO/IKKβ interaction as a
drug target,
several features of NEMO make drug discovery against this site challenging.
As a cytoplasmic protein, NEMO is not a candidate for targeting with
an antibody or other biopharmaceutical agent, and therefore must be
targeted using a small-molecule (i.e., synthetic organic) drug or
other drug class that is membrane permeable. Moreover, as a protein–protein
interaction (PPI), the IKKβ binding site on NEMO falls into
a class of drug targets that has been considered challenging for small-molecule
drug discovery.23−27 There are also obstacles to obtaining a crystal structure of NEMO
or the relevant IKKβ binding domain of NEMO in an unbound state,
which limits the use of structure-based approaches in any drug discovery
effort. Although Rushe et al. were able to obtain a cocrystal structure
of NEMO44–111 with IKKβ701–745, they found that this NEMO fragment was disordered in the absence
of IKKβ peptide and thus is not a good candidate for crystallization.16 In contrast, we have recently reported evidence
suggesting that residues 44–111 of NEMO are not disordered
in the context of the full-length protein.15 Nevertheless, in the absence of a means to crystallize full-length
NEMO, the disorder in smaller fragments containing the IKKβ
binding domain presents an obstacle to obtaining a crystal structure
of this critical region of NEMO in an unbound state, or to cocrystallizing
NEMO with small-molecule ligands to obtain information on their binding
modes.

Here we characterize the structure and stability of the
IKKβ
binding domain of NEMO, and use biochemical and biophysical approaches
to investigate how the active coiled-coil conformation of NEMO can
be stabilized through formation of appropriately positioned interchain
disulfide bonds. We demonstrate that covalent dimerization of NEMO44–111 or NEMO1–120, either through
oxidation of the native cysteine at position 54 or by introduction
of a cysteine at position 107 through a Leu107Cys mutation, induces
formation of a coiled-coil structure that is stable in the absence
of IKKβ peptide. We quantify the degree of stabilization afforded
by interchain disulfide bonds at each of these two positions using
chemical and thermal denaturation, and show that the disulfide-stabilized
constructs are active for binding IKKβ. We further show that,
when expressed in mammalian cells, full-length NEMO-L107C forms covalent
dimers upon treatment of the cells with H2O2, and that NEMO-L107C can bind endogenous IKKβ and reconstitute
NF-κB signaling in mammalian cells in culture. Taken together,
our results show that the IKKβ binding region is natively ordered
as a coiled coil within the NEMO dimer, and identify noncovalent interactions
in the region of NEMO centered on Cys54 as a major contributor to
coiled-coil stability. Furthermore, the disulfide-stabilized constructs
we describe may enable crystallization of NEMO’s IKKβ
binding domain in the unbound state or with small-molecule inhibitors.

Experimental
Procedures
Construction of Bacterial and Retroviral Expression Vectors
Bacterial expression of the NEMO1–120 and NEMO44–111 constructs used the backbone vector pDEST-His-SUMO
containing an N-terminal 9xHis-SUMO tag (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
The human NEMO1–120 or NEMO44–111 sequence together with an N-terminal tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage
site was cloned into this vector through two rounds of PCR using the
standard Gateway cloning protocol. In the first round of PCR, the
TEV cleavage site was added to the N terminus of NEMO 1–120
or 44–111 using primers containing both the TEV cleavage site
and a partial NEMO sequence. A full-length human NEMO cDNA containing
cysteine-to-alanine mutations at positions 11, 76, 95, 131, and 16728 was used as a template. In the second round,
attB sites were added to both ends of the first round PCR product
using primers containing attB/attP sites. Primer sequences are provided
in the Supporting Information. All PCRs
were performed on an MJ Mini Personal Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) using
the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, then 30 cycles of
95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s,
followed by 72 °C for 10 min at the completion of the cycles,
and then 4 °C until the run was stopped. A total volume of 50
μL was used for PCRs, and reactions consisted of 37 μL
of water, 5 μL of DeepVent thermal buffer, 1 μL of DeepVent
polymerase (2.5 U/μL) (New England Biolabs), 1 μL of dNTP
(10 μM), 1 μL of template (50 ng/μL), 2.5 μL
of forward primer (10 μM), and 2.5 μL of reverse primer
(10 μM). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification
Kit (Qiagen). The BP reaction was performed in a total volume of 5
μL, which included 0.4 μL of pDONR221 (375 ng/μL),
3.6 μL of PCR product (70 ng/μL), and 1 μL of Gateway
BP Clonase II Enzyme mix. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for
1 h, and reactions were then quenched by adding 0.5 μL of proteinase
K and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. Products were transformed
into DH5α competent cells, and colonies were isolated on LB
plates containing kanamycin (50 μg/mL). Plasmids were purified
from kanamycin-resistant colonies using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep
Kit (Qiagen), and were sequenced to verify that the DNA sequences
were inserted successfully into pDONR221. The LR reaction was then
performed in a total volume of 5 μL, containing 1 μL of
pDEST-His-SUMO (100 ng/μL), 2 μL of pDONR221-target DNA
(125 ng/μL), 1 μL of Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme mix,
and 1 μL of water. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for
1 h, and reactions were quenched by adding 0.5 μL proteinase
K and incubating at 37 °C for 10 min. Products were transformed
into DH5α competent cells and transformed colonies were selected
on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). As above, plasmids
were purified by using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and
sequenced to verify their integrity.

Retroviral vectors (in
pBABE-puro) for expression of wild-type and 7xAla NEMO have been described
previously.15 The pBABE vector for the
expression of L107C was created by PCR-based overlap mutagenesis to
change Leu codon 107 (CTC) to Cys (TGC) in the 7xAla NEMO mutant vector.
The L107C change was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Details of retroviral
vector constructions can be found at www.nf-kb.org.

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis
All codon changes in bacterial
expression vectors for NEMO were created using the following procedures.
First, PCR using mutant oligonucleotides was performed under the following
conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, then 15 cycles of 95 °C for
30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 7 min, followed by
68 °C for 10 min at the completion of the cycles, and then 4
°C until the run was stopped. Components of the PCRs were as
described above. After PCR, 1 μL of DpnI was added and the samples
were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. A volume of 5 μL of the
reaction was then transformed into DH5α competent cells. Plasmids
with mutations were selected and sequenced as described above.

Plasmid expression vectors for the expression of FLAG-tagged 7xAla,
5xAla, and 7xAla/L107C NEMO were created by subcloning PCR-amplified
cDNA fragments into pcDNA-FLAG with EcoRI and BamHI, as described previously for wild-type pcDNA-FLAG-NEMO.28 pcDNA-HA-TRAF6 was described previously.29

Protein Expression and Purification
For protein expression,
plasmids were transformed into T7 express competent Escherichia
coli BL21 (DE3) cells (New England Biolabs) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions, and transformants were selected
on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). A single colony
was used to inoculate 50 mL of LB with ampicillin, and the culture
was incubated at 37 °C overnight with shaking. For large-scale
expression, 1 L of LB containing ampicillin was inoculated with 10
mL of the overnight culture. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an
OD600 of 0.4–0.6. To induce protein expression,
IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and cells were grown
for an additional 2 h. Then 2.5 g of cells were isolated by centrifugation
and were lysed using a microfluidizer in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing
1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM PMSF, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 1 tablet of Roche protease
inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 18000g for 15 min, and the supernatant discarded, to leave a
pellet containing cell debris together with inclusion bodies containing
the target protein. The pellet was washed and suspended using wash
buffer (lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100). The washed
inclusion body pellet was centrifuged as described above, and the
wash step was repeated with water to remove the Triton X-100. Inclusion
bodies were solubilized with 8 M Urea, by pipetting repeatedly until
the inclusion bodies were thoroughly dissolved. This solubilization
step can take as long as overnight to maximize the inclusion body
dissolution, and to give time for full oxidation of cysteine thiols
into disulfides. The denatured target protein was refolded on a HisTrap
HP 5 mL column and purified. The on-column refolding and purification
were performed under the following conditions: 10 mL of dissolved
inclusion bodies was loaded onto the column, the bound protein was
refolded by washing the column with 20 column volumes of a linear
gradient of 8 M urea with nickel column binding buffer (20 mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole), and then the refolded
protein was eluted from the column with elution buffer (20 mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). Elution of the protein
was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm, and the fractions containing
protein were combined and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal
filter unit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein
was quantified by absorbance at 280 nm using a NanoDrop 2000 instrument
(Thermo Scientific), using extinction coefficients calculated by the
ExPASy Proteomics Server.30

The 9xHis-SUMO
fusion partner was removed using TEV protease, as described previously.31 Briefly, the tagged proteins were dialyzed into
TEV reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT).
TEV protease was added to the 9xHis-SUMO-NEMO substrate at a ratio
of 1:100, based on O.D.280, and the reaction mixture incubated
overnight at 4 °C. The product mixture was loaded onto a HisTrap
HP 5 mL column to separate the untagged NEMO from the cleaved 9xHis-SUMO
fusion partner. The cleaved NEMO protein was concentrated and dialyzed
into 50 mM HEPES buffer. The protein was flash frozen and stored at
−80 °C. All variants were analyzed by mass spectrometry
to confirm the intact mass. Samples were estimated to be &gt;95% pure
as determined by SDS-PAGE. After removal of the fusion partner, the
NEMO44–111 constructs contained no tryptophan or
tyrosine and, therefore, had negligible absorbance at 280 nm. For
these proteins, the concentrations were measured at 205 nm in a 1
cm path length quartz cuvette, using an extinction coefficient that
was calculated from the amino acid sequence as described.32 Quantifications were performed in triplicate.

All constructs containing cysteines at position 54 and/or 107 were
found to exist as 100% covalent dimer after purification, as shown
by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, provided that sufficient time was allowed
during solubilization of the inclusion bodies to ensure oxidation
of free cysteines. For the constructs containing cysteine at both
positions 54 and 107, which would migrate as a dimer in nonreducing
SDS-PAGE even if only one disulfide were present, full oxidation was
demonstrated using the colorimetric thiol reagent 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB). To prepare 100% monomeric forms of the cysteine-containing
constructs, the protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with
25 mM DTT in 6 M urea. The urea was removed by buffer exchange, using
an Amicon column, into a storage buffer for monomeric protein of 50
mM HEPES buffer containing 25 mM DTT.

DTT Reduction Tolerance
Test
To assess each construct’s
tolerance to DTT, NEMO1–120 proteins at a concentration
of 100 μM were incubated in water containing 25 mM DTT at 4
°C for various periods of time, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE
without boiling. To determine whether the protein could be reduced
under denaturing conditions, 100 μM of protein was incubated
with 25 mM reducing agent (TCEP or DTT) with or without 6 M urea at
room temperature for 1 h. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE together
with a control sample that was boiled in reducing buffer containing
100 mM DTT. To determine the DTT concentration required to reduce
Cys54-containing NEMO dimers under denaturing conditions, NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with 6 M urea plus various concentrations of DTT.

Circular Dichroism
Spectroscopy
CD spectra were measured
using an Applied Photophysics CS/2 Chirascan instrument with a 1 mm
path length quartz cuvette at a scan speed of 2 nm/s. Unless otherwise
indicated, spectra were measured at 10 μM NEMO protein (based
on NEMO monomer) in sodium phosphate at pH 7.4 at 25 °C. The
buffer background was subtracted. The measured ellipticity in millidegrees
(θ) was converted to mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRE) using the following equation: 1  where C is the molar concentration, n is the number of residues, and l is the
path length in cm. The CD spectra in water and phosphate buffer were
found to be identical, and so the results were combined and treated
as replicates. Three independent measurements were conducted for each
NEMO sample. The percent α-helix content was determined by comparing
the [θ]MRE at 222 nm measured after 2 h of incubation
at room temperature in aqueous buffer (20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4) with
that measured in 97% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), using the equation
below: 2  

Urea-Induced Denaturation Studies
NEMO protein was
incubated at 25 °C for at least 1 h with freshly prepared urea
solution diluted to different concentrations, in 20 mM phosphate,
pH 7.4, before CD measurement of mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm
as described above. Preliminary measurements showed no difference
in denaturation curves when the protein was incubated for 1 or 24
h, indicating that an incubation time of 1 h was sufficient to reach
equilibrium. To determine whether the denaturation was reversible,
identical samples of 100 μM NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C)
were treated either with 4 M urea to ensure complete denaturation,
or with water as a control. After 1 h at 25 °C, each sample was
diluted 10-fold into water. After 30 min of refolding, CD spectra
were taken. There was no difference between the urea treated group
after refolding and water treated group (Figure S1, Supporting Information), indicating denaturation was fully
reversible.

Denaturation data were fitted by nonlinear least-squares
analysis to a two-state model containing additional terms to capture
the effect of urea on the measured ellipticity of the fully folded
and fully unfolded protein, as described.33,34 The equation used for fitting was: 3  where yf and mf are the intercept
and
slope of the urea dependence of [θ222]MRE for the fully folded protein, yu and mu are the corresponding intercept
and slope of the fully unfolded protein, ΔGH2O is the free energy of unfolding at zero
urea, m is the slope of the unfolding transition
region, R is the molar gas constant, and T is absolute temperature. This model was used because the
urea denaturation curves for NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C)
and for the corresponding NEMO44–111 construct showed
a positive linear slope at urea concentrations above the level required
for full denaturation of the protein, indicating that in these cases
urea has a small but significant effect on the ellipticity of the
fully denatured protein. Fitting the denaturation curves for these
constructs to the above equation while allowing mu to have a small positive value gave a better fit to
the data. For the other disulfide-stabilized constructs, allowing mu to have a nonzero value had no significant
effect on the curve fits or the values of the parameters ΔGH2O or m that were obtained
from the fitting; for the monomeric constructs NEMO1–120(des4C) and NEMO44–111(des3C), a value for mu of ∼0 was clearly preferred. In no
case was a nonzero value for mf indicated,
and so this parameter was fixed at zero for all data fits. Thus, only
for NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C) and NEMO44–111(des3C/L107C) was a pretransition or post-transition slope allowed,
with a positive value for mu being allowed
in these two cases. For the monomeric constructs NEMO1–120(des4C) and NEMO44–111(des3C), the value of yf, the ellipticity corresponding to fully folded
protein, was poorly defined by the experimental data because the protein
was &lt;50% folded even at zero urea. Therefore, in fitting the data
for these two constructs, we fixed the yf at the mean value observed for the other three constructs in the
series, based on the assumption that the fully folded state would
have an α-helical content similar to that seen for the native
states of the other constructs of the same length. For all denaturation
experiments we found that measurements made at the lowest and highest
urea concentrations (zero and 7.76 M urea) were variable and frequently
anomalous, and therefore data for these extreme urea concentrations
were excluded from fitting in all cases.

To linearize the denaturation
data, for the purpose of more clearly
illustrating the extrapolation to zero urea, we calculated the free
energy of unfolding, ΔG, at each urea concentration
using the following equation, 4  where the minimum and maximum ellipticities, yf and yu, are the
values determined for each construct from the nonlinear regression
analysis using eq 5. ΔG was then plotted against urea concentration to generate the linear
plots.

Thermal Denaturation Studies
Proteins, at a concentration
of 10 μM in 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, were heated from 5 to 90
°C at a rate of 2.5 °C/min, using the internal temperature
control function of the CD spectrometer. Spectra from 180 to 260 nm
were taken at a scanning rate of 0.5 s/nm. No obvious difference in
melting curves was seen when the slower ramping rate of 1 °C/min
was used, suggesting that the selected rate was appropriate. Thermal
denaturation was completely reversible, as demonstrated by comparing
the CD spectra NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C) before and
after thermal denaturation and refolding (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The melting temperature Tm for each protein was estimated from the maximum of a
plot of the first derivative of θ222 was against
temperature. Each result represents the average of two independent
experiments.

Fluorescence Anisotropy Binding Assay
All bacterially
expressed NEMO variants were characterized by measuring their binding
affinities with IKKβ peptide (residues 701–745) in a
direct binding format using fluorescence anisotropy (FA) as described
previously.15,22 Assays were performed in 96-well
nontreated black polystyrene plates (Corning Costar), using a SpectraMax
M5 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For
each experiment, 50 μL of water, 50 μL of 4× TNT
buffer (200 mM Tris, 800 mM NaCl, 0.04% Triton X-100, 4 mM DTT, pH
7.5), 50 μL of N-terminally FITC-labeled IKKβ peptide
(60 nM), and 50 μL of NEMO protein at varying concentrations
were added to each well to give final concentrations of 15 nM FITC-IKKβ
in 50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.5 in
a total volume of 200 μL. The plates were incubated on a plate
shaker (UltraCruz shaker for microplates, Santa Cruz Biothechnology)
for 1 h at 250 rpm, and were then incubated at 25 °C for 5 min
before fluorescence was measured. Samples were read by excitation
at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm in high sensitivity mode. Values
were the averages of 100 measurements for each well, and each experiment
was done in duplicate. After background subtraction the anisotropy
values, A, were fitted by nonlinear least-squares
regression to the modified quadratic binding equation shown below:15 5  where A0 is the
anisotropy observed for unbound FITC-IKKβ, Amax is the maximum anisotropy signal at saturating [NEMO],
[R]T and [L]T are the total concentrations of
NEMO protein and FITC-IKKβ, and KD is the binding affinity. When fitting the binding data for the monomeric
constructs NEMO1–120(des4C) and NEMO44–111(des3C), the value of Amax was fixed
at the average value observed for the three disulfide-stabilized constructs
in the same series.

Mammalian Cell Culture and Transfection
A293T cells
and NEMO-deficient mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Biologos, Montgomery, IL) and penicillin–streptomycin as described.15,28 A293T cells were transfected with plasmids for expression of FLAG-tagged
NEMO or HA-tagged TRAF6 proteins using the polyethylenimine (PEI)
method as described previously.28 Retrovirus
stocks for the expression of NEMO proteins were prepared by cotransfecting
BOSC23 packaging cells as described previously.15,28 After infection, retrovirally transduced NEMO-deficient fibroblasts
were selected with 1 μg/mL puromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

Western Blotting and Co-Immunoprecipitation
Western
blotting was performed as described previously.15 For the analysis of FLAG-NEMO proteins from transfected
A293T cells, whole-cell extracts were prepared in AT buffer (20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM DTT, 1% v/v Triton X-100, 20% w/v
glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/mL PMSF, 1
μg/mL leupeptin, 1 μg/mL pepstatin). Samples containing
approximately equal amounts of protein were then boiled in SDS-sample
buffer (0.625 M Tris, pH 6.8, 2.3% w/v SDS, 10% w/v glycerol) with
or without 5% β-mercaptoethanol. For analyzing H2O2-induced NEMO dimerization, transfected A293T cells
were treated with 0.2 or 1 mM H2O2 for 10 min
and samples were lysed directly in SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol.
For analyzing total NEMO or phosphorylated IκBα, retrovirally
transduced NEMO deficient cells were treated with 20 ng/mL TNFα
(R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 10 min and then lysed directly
in SDS sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples
containing approximately equal amounts of protein were then analyzed
by Western blotting with anti-NEMO antiserum (#2685, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA; 1:1000 dilution) or anti-phospho-IκBα
antiserum (#9246, Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000 dilution). In
all cases, the primary antibody–antigen complexes were detected
with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antiserum and Supersignal
Dura West chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific).

Co-immunoprecipitation
experiments on transfected A293T cells were performed as described
previously.15 Briefly, cells in 35-mm tissue
culture dishes were lysed in 200 μL of AT buffer. An aliquot
(5 μL) was saved as the input sample. A 100 μL aliquot
of the lysate was immunoprecipitated with 30 μL of anti-M2 FLAG
agarose beads (cat #A2220; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After washing, bound
proteins were removed by heating the beads for 10 min at 90 °C
in SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol. Samples (input
or immunoprecipitate) were then analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE followed
by Western blotting with anti-FLAG (cat #2368; Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA), anti-IKKβ (sc-7607; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
or anti-HA (sc-805; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500) antiserum, as
described above.

TNFα-induced Cell Death Assays
NEMO-deficient
mouse fibroblasts reconstituted with 7xAla NEMO or 7xAla/L107C NEMO
were treated with 50 ng/mL TNFα (R&amp;D Systems) for 18 h,
and the number of live cells was determined using a crystal violet-based
cell viability assay, as described previously.15,28

Results
Protein Design, Expression, and Purification
NEMO fragment
44–111 has previously been reported to be structurally disordered
in the absence of bound IKKβ peptide.16 Our attempts to design a stabilized form of the IKKβ binding
domain of NEMO were guided by two hypotheses. One hypothesis was that
a substantially longer NEMO construct, encompassing residues 1–120
would generate additional noncovalent interactions sufficient to stabilize
the dimeric coiled-coil structure seen in the bound complex with IKKβ.
The second hypothesis was that covalent dimerization through one or
two appropriately positioned disulfide bonds would induce a stable
coiled-coil. The first 120 residues of NEMO contain four cysteine
residues, at positions 11, 54, 76, and 95 (Figure 1A). We have previously shown that none of these cysteines
is required for the IKKβ binding activity of full-length NEMO,
either in vitro or in cells.15 Therefore, in designing constructs containing specific, interchain
disulfide bonds, we changed all other cysteine residues to alanine,
to eliminate the possibility of disulfide-linked aggregation or non-native
disulfide bonding and thereby facilitate the generation of structurally
homogeneous proteins. Figure 2A shows that,
of the three cysteines in the structurally characterized region of
NEMO encompassing residues 44–111, Cys76 and Cys95 are positioned
such that they cannot participate in interchain disulfide bonds in
the IKKβ-bound conformation of the protein. Cys54, on the other
hand, appears well positioned to form a disulfide bond cross-linking
the two NEMO monomers that form the coiled coil (Figure 2B). The distance between the two Cys54 β
carbons is 4.3 Å, within the range of 3–6 Å required
for disulfide bonds in proteins.35 We therefore
designed a construct, NEMO1–120(des3C/C54), in which
cysteines 11, 76, and 95 were changed to alanine but Cys54 was retained,
to allow us to test the effect of a single interchain disulfide at
position 54 on the structure and properties of NEMO1–120, compared to a second construct, NEMO1–120(des4C),
in which all four native cysteines (11, 54, 76, and 95) were changed
to alanine.

are well positioned to form an interchain disulfide bond. (C) Close-up

such that cysteine residues introduced through L107C mutation would
be suitably positioned to form an interchain disulfide bond.59 (D) Schematic representation of the eight NEMO
constructs made in the current work. The TEV cleavage site is indicated
by a red triangle. The identities of the residues present at positions
54, 76, 95, and 107 (and at position 11 for the NEMO1–120 proteins) are indicated for each construct using the single letter
code for the amino acid.

The most important region of NEMO for binding IKKβ
lies roughly
between residues 89 and 104,22 some distance
from Cys54. Therefore, we wished to determine whether introduction
of an interchain disulfide closer to the 89–104 region would
stabilize the structure of this key part of the IKKβ binding
domain. Examination of the cocrystal structure of NEMO44–111 with IKKβ701–745 showed that Leu107 is positioned
such that mutation to cysteine should allow formation of an interchain
disulfide bond with minimal disruption of the polypeptide backbone
conformation (Figure 2C). We therefore made
a third construct, NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C), in which
all four native cysteines were changed to alanine, and a cysteine
was introduced at position 107. Finally, we created a fourth construct
that contained both the native Cys54 and the L107C mutation, designated
NEMO1–120(des3C/C54/L107C), to test the effect of
interchain disulfide bonds at both of these positions on the structure
and stability of NEMO1–120. The structures of these
four NEMO1–120 constructs are shown schematically
in Figure 2D. To enable us to distinguish effects
due to construct length from effects due to the introduction of interchain
disulfide bonds, we created a corresponding set of mutants based
on the minimal IKKβ binding region NEMO-44–111, designated NEMO44–111(des3C), NEMO44–111(des2C/C54), NEMO44–111(des3C/L107C), and NEMO44–111(des2C/C54/L107C) (Figure 2D).

The NEMO
constructs described above were
expressed in bacteria
as SUMO fusion proteins containing an N-terminal 9xHis tag for affinity
purification and a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site between
the SUMO domain and the first NEMO residue (Figure 2D). The SUMO fusion partner was used to improve expression
and to provide additional bulk to facilitate analysis of NEMO protein
binding properties by fluorescence anisotropy (FA). The TEV site was
designed such that removal of the 9xHis-SUMO fusion partner with TEV
protease left only three non-native amino acids (Gly-Ser-Gly) at the
N terminus of the NEMO protein. The proteins were expressed in E. coli, resolubilized from inclusion bodies under denaturing
conditions in 8 M urea, and refolded on a Ni/NTA metal ion affinity
column before being eluted from the column with an imidazole gradient.
Analysis of the products by SDS-PAGE showed that, with the exception
of NEMO1–120(des4C) and NEMO44–111 (des3C) which contain no cysteines, all constructs purified as covalent
dimers, and could be reduced to monomers of the expected size by boiling
in 100 mM DTT for 5 min (Figure 3A). The 9xHis-SUMO
fusion partner was removed by incubation of the purified fusion constructs
with TEV protease, followed by removal of the cleaved 9xHis-SUMO fragment
by passage over a Ni/NTA metal ion affinity column, as described in Experimental Procedures (Figure 3B–D). Notably, constructs containing Cys54 were highly
resistant to reduction under native conditions. For example, treatment
of the cleaved NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) with 25 mM DTT
at 4 °C achieved only ∼50% reduction even after 3 weeks
(Figure 3B), with NEMO1–120(des3C/C54/L107C) showing even less reduction under similar conditions.
Either boiling or denaturant (urea) was required in addition to DTT
to completely reduce the dimer (Figure 3C).
Even under denaturing conditions, 25 mM DTT or TCEP was required to
reduce Cys54-containing constructs within 1 h (Figure 3D). In contrast, NEMO1–120(L107C) was readily
reduced by DTT even in the absence of urea (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 Analysis of NEMO constructs by SDS-PAGE. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis
showing that NEMO1–120(des4C) and NEMO44–111(des3C) purify as monomers, while the other cysteine containing NEMO1–120 and NEMO44–111 constructs as
isolated are predominantly covalent dimers that can be reduced to
monomers by boiling under reducing, denaturing conditions. (B) Susceptibility
of the NEMO1–120 proteins to reduction with 25 mM
DTT after removal of the 9xHis-SUMO fusion partner using TEV protease.
The cleaved products were treated with 25 mM DTT in water at 4 °C
for various times, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE without boiling.
The C54 containing constructs are highly resistant to reduction under
nondenaturing conditions, whereas the construct containing only a
single disulfide at position 107 is readily reduced. The result shown
is representative of two independent experiments. (C) SDS-PAGE analysis
showing that TEV-cleaved NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) can
be reduced by 25 mM DTT or TCEP (1 h at room temperature) under denaturing
conditions. (D) SDS-PAGE analysis (without boiling) of TEV-cleaved
NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) incubated with various concentrations
of DTT, decreasing from 25 mM in 2-fold dilutions, in 6 M urea for
1 h at room temperature, showing that 25 mM DTT is required to reduce
NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) even under denaturing conditions.

Introduction of Interchain
Disulfides Induces Increased α-Helical
Structure in NEMO
To test the hypothesis that the NEMO N-terminal
domain α-helical coiled-coil can be stabilized by the inclusion
of all residues from 1 to 120 or by covalent dimerization through
appropriately placed disulfides, we characterized the structure and
stability of the eight NEMO constructs shown in Figure 2D using circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry, after removal
of the 9xHis-SUMO tag with TEV protease. The α-helical content
was quantified by comparison to the spectrum obtained for the same
construct in 97% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), a solvent which favors
α-helix formation,36,37 as shown in Figure
S3 (Supporting Information). Fully reduced,
monomeric NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) gave a CD spectrum
indicating only 37% α-helical structure (Figure 4A), identical to the helical content of NEMO1–120(des4C) which contains no cysteines (Table 1). These values are similar to the 32% α-helical content seen
with the monomeric construct NEMO44–111(des3C) (Table 1), suggesting that extension of this shorter fragment
to include residues 1–43 and 112–120 was not sufficient
to stabilize a coiled-coil structure. In contrast, CD analysis of
the same construct in the oxidized state, which is a covalent dimer
due to an interchain disulfide bond at position 54, showed a substantial
increase in α-helical content to 60% (Figure 4A). NEMO1–120 containing an engineered interchain
disulfide at position 107 (NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C))
or containing disulfides at both positions 54 and 107 (NEMO1–120(des3C/C54/L107C)) similarly showed 60–70% α-helical
content (Table 1). In the shorter NEMO44–111 constructs, the presence of disulfide bonds at
positions 54 and/or 107 increased α-helical content to an even
greater degree, with the values ranging from 75 to 88% α-helix
depending on the construct (Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information and Table 1).

reduced, monomeric TEV-cleaved NEMO1–120(des3C/C54)

disulfide bond at position 54, possesses a substantially α-helical
structure (solid line). Spectra shown are representative of two independent
experiments. (B) Overlaid CD spectra (20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4) showing

h n.d.: Not done.

In the published X-ray crystal structure of NEMO44–111 with IKKβ701–745, amino
acids 44–48
and 111 are not visible in the structure, suggesting that these terminal
residues are substantially disordered or mobile. The residual GSG
tripeptide left at the N termini of our constructs after TEV cleavage
presumably also is disordered. Thus, for the NEMO44–111 constructs adoption of the conformation seen in the crystal structure
would correspond to 60 residues of α-helix out of 70 residues
total = 86% α-helix content. Thus, the level of α-helix
content observed for the three disulfide-stabilized NEMO44–111 constructs, shown in Table 1, is consistent
with the nearly complete adoption of the active conformation of the
protein that was seen crystallographically.16 For the longer NEMO1–120 constructs, adoption
of a fully α-helical structure between residues 50 and 108,
with the remainder of the protein being disordered, would correspond
to an α-helix content of 49% (60 out of 123 residues). The extent
of α-helix content observed for the disulfide-stabilized forms
of NEMO1–120 thus indicates that an additional dozen
or so of the ∼60 residues outside the immediate IKKβ
binding region are also α-helical in these constructs. This
interpretation is consistent with the observation that a fraction
of NEMO1–120(des4C) spontaneously adopts an α-helical
structure even as a monomer. Taken together, the above results show
that enforcing covalent dimerization via an interchain disulfide bond
at position 54 and/or position 107 stabilizes a conformation of NEMO
that is largely α-helical in the IKKβ binding region extending
roughly from residues 50–108, but that the protein outside
of this region remains largely unstructured especially in the longer,
NEMO1–120 constructs.

Disulfide-Stabilized NEMO
Constructs Show Increased Binding
Affinity for IKKβ
To determine whether the increased
α-helical content of the disulfide-stabilized NEMO constructs
described above is due to stabilization of the active α-helical
coiled-coil conformation seen crystallographically for NEMO44–111 bound to IKKβ701–745 peptide,16 we tested the ability of each protein to bind
FITC-labeled IKKβ701–745. FITC-IKKβ701–745 has been shown previously to bind to both full-length
NEMO22 and to truncated NEMO constructs
that contain the NEMO N-terminal domain.16 For these measurements, we used the FA binding assay that we have
described previously.22 In this assay,
a fixed concentration of 15 nM FITC-IKKβ701–745 is incubated with various concentrations of NEMO protein. The binding
affinity can be determined by plotting total anisotropy versus NEMO
concentration and fitting to the appropriate quadratic or hyperbolic
binding equation.15,38 We used the intact 9xHis-SUMO
fusion proteins for these initial measurements to maximize the reduction
in tumbling rate of the labeled peptide upon binding, so as to ensure
a robust change in anisotropy.

We initially measured the binding
of FITC-IKKβ701–745 to the four NEMO1–120 constructs. We also compared the binding activity of NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) as a covalent dimer versus as a fully reduced monomer,
so as to directly test the consequences for activity of the presence
or absence of an interchain disulfide bond in the same construct.
The results show that the monomeric forms of NEMO1–120 bound IKKβ701–745 with only micromolar affinity,
but the forms stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds at positions
54 and/or 107 bound 6–30-fold more strongly (Figure 5A, Table 1). A similar pattern
of activities was seen for the NEMO44–111 constructs
des3C, des3C/L107C, and des2C/C54/L107C (des2C/C54 was not tested)
(Figure S5A, Supporting Information). To
make sure that the binding activities of the constructs were not influenced
by the presence of the 9xHis-SUMO we repeated the measurements with
the NEMO1–120 constructs after removal of the fusion
partner. The results showed that the presence of the fusion partner
had no significant effect on the binding properties of the constructs
(Figure S5B, Supporting Information). Taken
together, these results indicate that the disulfide-stabilized forms
of NEMO are active, and that covalent dimerization preorganizes the
polypeptide in a conformation that confers relatively high affinity
binding with IKKβ.

in Experimental Procedures. Results show the

an extra term to account for the effect of urea on the observed ellipticity
of the fully denatured protein (see text). Plotted are average values
from three independent experiments; error bars are standard deviations.

Information). In panels (A)–(D) the cysteine-containing
constructs are present in their oxidized, covalently dimeric form.

Interchain Disulfide Bonds
Increase the Resistance of NEMO to
Chemical and Thermal Denaturation
To assess the effect of
covalent dimerization on the stability of the α-helical structure
of NEMO, we performed chemical and thermal denaturation experiments
on the NEMO constructs using CD to monitor loss of secondary structure.
A decrease in mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (θ222) indicates a decrease in α-helical content.39 These measurements were done using the TEV-cleaved NEMO
constructs to avoid interference from the presence of the 9xHis-SUMO
fusion partner. Preliminary time-course measurements showed that the
extent of denaturation attained its equilibrium value within 1 h,
leading us to choose an incubation period of 1 h for subsequent experiments.
As shown in Figure 5B, all four NEMO1–120 constructs were completely denatured by 8 M urea at 25 °C.
However, at lower concentrations of urea they showed different degrees
of denaturation. NEMO1–120(des4C), which contains
no cysteine and thus cannot form covalent dimers, was highly sensitive
to denaturant. Indeed, the CD analysis showed that NEMO1–120(des4C) is &lt;50% ordered even in the absence of urea. NEMO1–120(des3C/C54) and NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C)
showed [urea]50 values of 1.5–2.0 M, indicating
that the presence of a single interchain disulfide bond at position
54 substantially stabilized the protein. The presence of two disulfides,
at 54 and 107, resulted in additional stabilization, as shown by NEMO1–120(des3C/C54/L107C)
which gave a [urea]50 value of 4.3 ± 0.5 M. In comparing
the denaturation curves for NEMO1–120(des3C/C54)
and NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C), it is notable that the
construct containing the engineered Cys107 has a much steeper slope
than that containing only the native Cys54.

We analyzed the
urea denaturation curves to determine the free energy of unfolding
of each variant extrapolated to zero urea, ΔGH2O, by fitting the results to a two-state
unfolding model (eq 3, Experimental
Procedures) using nonlinear regression (Figure 5B).33,34 This analysis is valid only if
denaturation is reversible. We therefore tested reversibility by incubating
NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C) in 4 M urea for 1 h, conditions
which fully denature this construct (Figure 5B), and then diluting the protein 10-fold into aqueous buffer to
give a final urea concentration of 0.4 M. The CD spectrum of the renatured
protein was indistinguishable from that of a protein sample that was
treated identically in the absence of urea (Figure S1, Supporting Information), showing that urea denaturation
of the protein was fully reversible. Analysis of the denaturation
curves showed that the monomeric NEMO1–120 construct
containing no cysteines is largely denatured even in the absence of
urea, with ΔGH2O &lt;
0 at 25 °C (Table 1). The presence of
a single interchain disulfide at position 54 stabilized the folded
state to give ΔGH2O =
0.7 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, while the engineered disulfide at position
107 achieved a greater stabilization of 2.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol. The
NEMO1–120 construct containing disulfides at both
54 and 107 was the most stable, with ΔGH2O = 3.0 ± 0.2 kcal/mol. The denaturation
behavior of the NEMO44–111 constructs was essentially
identical to that seen for the longer NEMO constructs, both qualitatively
(Figure 5C) and quantitatively (Table 1). The denaturation data for the NEMO1–120 and NEMO44–111 were also plotted in a linearized
form, as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), and showed good linearity, further validating the use of a two-state
unfolding model.

We also characterized the stability of the
NEMO variants in response
to thermal denaturation. We monitored the structure of each protein
by CD using ellipticity at 222 nm measured while slowly increasing
the temperature of the sample from 5 to 90 °C. As shown in Figure 5D, the NEMO 1–120 variants showed a range
of melting temperatures. NEMO1–120(des4C) gave a
melting temperature of Tm = 27 ±
2 °C, consistent with this monomeric construct being &lt;50%
structured at room temperature. The presence of a single disulfide
at either position 54 or 107 substantially stabilized the proteins,
resulting in Tm values of 33 and 45 °C,
respectively. The construct containing two disulfides was highly stable
to thermal denaturation, melting only at 67 ± 4 °C. The
thermal stabilities of the NEMO44–111 constructs
were also measured, and gave similar results to those seen with the
longer NEMO1–120 proteins (Table 1 and Figure S4, Supporting Information).

The L107C Mutation Can Mediate Covalent Dimerization of Full-Length
NEMO, and Does Not Affect NEMO’s Ability to Activate NF-κB
Signaling and Bind to TRAF6 in Cells
We have previously shown
that Cys54 can engage in interchain disulfide bonding to form a covalent
NEMO dimer in the context of full-length NEMO protein,15,28 but that the presence or absence of a disulfide at Cys54 does not
affect the binding affinity for IKKβ because full-length NEMO
is constitutively dimeric even when fully reduced in vivo.15 The structural and functional consequences
of introducing a cysteine at position 107 into full-length NEMO have
not previously been investigated, however. To gain additional evidence
that the L107C mutation we introduced into the NEMO1–120 and NEMO44–111 constructs does not compromise
the protein’s function, we introduced the L107C change into
full-length NEMO and evaluated the activity of this construct in a
range of cellular assays. The L107C change was made in the 7xAla NEMO
background to allow us to evaluate disulfide formation at position
107 without interference from the cysteines present in wild-type protein
at positions 54 and 347, which can mediate covalent dimerization of
NEMO in vivo.15,28 We have previously
shown that the 7xAla NEMO mutant can fully restore NF-κB signaling
when expressed in NEMO-deficient mouse fibroblasts.15 First, we determined whether a cysteine at position 107
can mediate interchain disulfide bond formation in full-length NEMO
in cells. FLAG-tagged versions of wild-type, 7xAla, and 7xAla/L107C
NEMO were expressed in A293T cells and the protein’s propensity
to form disulfide mediated dimers was assessed in two ways: (1) by
the formation of dimers post-lysis in the presence of molecular oxygen,
and (2) by the formation of dimers when intact cells were treated
with hydrogen peroxide. We have shown previously that exposure of
cell lysates to molecular oxygen can induce NEMO dimer formation in
a Cys54/347-dependent fashion.28 Therefore,
we lysed cells overexpressing the relevant NEMO proteins under oxidizing
conditions and then analyzed NEMO protein by Western blotting under
reducing (plus β-mercaptoethanol) or nonreducing (no β-mercaptoethanol)
conditions. As shown in Figure 6A, wild-type
NEMO and 7xAla/L107C NEMO (but not 7xAla NEMO) were converted to covalent
dimers when cells were lysed under these nonreducing conditions, and
these dimers were reduced to monomers by treatment of the lysates
with SDS sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol before SDS-PAGE.
Similarly, treatment of intact cells with H2O2 induced wild-type and 7xAla/L107C NEMO, but not 7xAla NEMO, to form
covalent dimers (Figure 6B). Indeed, we generally
found that the L107C mutant formed disulfide-bonded dimers more efficiently
than wild-type NEMO under both conditions.

Samples were then analyzed by anti-FLAG Western blotting. The positions

(B) Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of H2O2 for 10 min and whole-cell extracts were prepared

was then performed as in (A). Shorter (top) and longer (bottom) exposures

in L107C dimer with H2O2 treatment (upper image)
and the dose-dependent dimerization of wild-type NEMO (bottom image).

extracts were subjected to anti-NEMO Western blotting (top panel).
Cells were also treated (+) with 20 ng/mL of TNFα for 10 min
and extracts were subjected to Western blotting for phospho-IκBα
(middle panel). For the bottom graph, cells were treated with 50 ng/mL
TNFα for approximately 18 h, and the number of viable cells
was quantified by crystal violet staining. % Cell Viability is percentage

with triplicate samples, with the indicated standard deviations. (E)
A293T cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for HA-TRAF6
and for the indicated FLAG-tagged NEMO proteins or an empty vector.
The identity of the NEMO constructs is as follows: w.t., wild-type
NEMO; 7xAla, NEMO in which the seven cysteine residues at positions
11, 54, 76, 95, 131, 167, and 347 have each been mutated to Ala; 5xAla,
NEMO in which the five cysteine residues at positions 11, 76, 95,
131, and 167 are mutated to Ala, such that Cys54 and Cys347 are retained;
L107C, 7xAla NEMO in which the additional mutation L107C has been
introduced. The 7xAla and 5xAla NEMO constructs have been described
previously.15 Extracts from cells were
immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads (IP: FLAG) and then Western
blotted for either HA-TRAF6 (top) or FLAG-NEMO (bottom). The identity
of the HA-TRAF6 protein was confirmed by anti-TRAF6 Western blotting
[not shown]. The lanes marked Input include ∼5% of the extract
used in the immunoprecipitation.

To assess the ability of L107C NEMO to participate in NF-κB
signaling, we conducted three experiments. First, by coimmunoprecipitation
using anti-FLAG beads, we found that overexpressed FLAG-7xAla/L107C
NEMO could interact with endogenous IKKβ in A293T cells, as
could FLAG-tagged wild-type and 7xAla NEMO (Figure 6C). Second, NEMO-deficient fibroblasts were retrovirally transduced
with 7xAla or 7xAla/L107C NEMO, or a control vector containing no
gene. Cells were then treated with TNFα for 10 min to measure
phosphorylation of IκBα or for 18 h to assess the ability
of the given NEMO protein to protect cells from TNFα-induced
cell death. Cells expressing either 7xAla or 7xAla/L107C NEMO showed
an increase in phospho-IκBα in response to 10 min treatment
with TNFα (Figure 6D, middle), whereas
control cells showed no phospho-IκBα in the presence or
absence of TNFα. Moreover, 7xAla NEMO and 7xAla/L107C NEMO both
restored the ability of the NEMO-deficient cells to survive when treated
with TNFα for 18 h, whereas transduction with an empty retroviral
vector did not protect these cells (Figure 6D, bottom). Activation of the NF-κB pathway in response to
TNFα requires that NEMO interact not only with IKKβ through
its N-terminal domain, but also with IκB through NEMO’s
C-terminal zinc finger domains40,41 and (noncovalently)
with di-Ubiquitin through NEMO’s central CoZi domain.42 NEMO has also been shown to interact with E3
ligase TRAF6 for activation of a variety of downstream signaling pathways
that are important for normal cell function, and several human disease
mutations specifically affect the NEMO-TRAF6 interaction.43,44 Therefore, as an additional measure of NEMO activity, we assessed
the ability of our Cys mutant NEMO proteins to interact with TRAF6.
As shown in Figure 6E, all NEMO Cys mutants
(7xAla, 5xAla [7xAla + C54/347], and 7xAla/L107C) interacted with
TRAF6 as efficiently as wild-type NEMO, as measured by coimunoprecipitation
from transfected A293T cells. Thus, the functional assay shown in
Figure 6D provides evidence that 7xAla/L107C
NEMO retains the ability to productively interact with key binding
partners at sites up and down its length.

Taken together, these
results demonstrate that a cysteine at residue
107 of NEMO can participate in disulfide formation in the context
of full-length NEMO when expressed in mammalian cells, and that the
L107C mutation does not affect the ability of NEMO to functionally
interact with IKKβ, IκB, diubiquitin or TRAF6 or to activate
productive NF-κB signaling in mammalian cells.

Discussion
In this work we tested the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain
of NEMO possesses a stable coiled-coil structure in the dimeric state,
where dimer formation is induced either by the introduction of interchain
disulfide bonds or by noncovalent interactions between NEMO polypeptides
of sufficient length. The results show that enforcing dimerization
through one or two appropriately positioned disulfide bonds results
in essentially full ordering of the α-helical coiled-coil region
between approximately residues 50 and 108, which constitutes the IKKβ
binding region of NEMO. This induced ordering preorganizes this region
of NEMO for binding IKKβ, as shown by the accompanying enhancement
in IKKβ binding affinity. In contrast, NEMO residues 1–50
appear to be largely disordered in both bound and unbound states.
The finding that enforcing dimerization of the NEMO IKKβ binding
domain induces a stable α-helical coiled coil supports our previous
proposal that the IKKβ binding region of NEMO is ordered in
the context of the full-length protein, which is constitutively dimeric.15

An interesting feature of our findings
is that the presence of
an interchain disulfide bond at position 54 versus position 107 appears
to stabilize the active, coiled-coil conformation of NEMO to different
extents. Constructs containing a single disulfide at position 54 were
relatively easy to denature, but were exceptionally difficult to reduce,
whereas constructs containing a single disulfide at position 107 were
more difficult to denature but easier to reduce. The resistance to
reduction of NEMO molecules containing Cys54 suggests that a disulfide
at this position is buried within a relatively extensive and intimate
contact interface, thereby restricting access by the reducing agent.
Examination of the published X-ray crystal structure of NEMO44–111 in complex with IKKβ701–745 indicates that
the interaction between the NEMO polypeptides is close and relatively
extensive in the vicinity of Cys54, as compared to the much less intimate
contact in the region of Leu107 (Figure 7).16 There is minimal direct interaction between
the NEMO monomers outside of these two localized contacts (Figure 7C). The greater free energy of unfolding with NEMO1–120(des4C/L107C) and NEMO44–111(des3C/L107C),
compared to the constructs containing only a disulfide at Cys54, is
consistent with this interpretation. Denaturation of the constructs
containing a single disulfide at position 107 involves disruption
of the intimate contact between the NEMO monomers in the vicinity
of amino acid 54, while the presence of a disulfide at position 54
presumably locks this region together such that denaturation involves
primarily the disruption of only the weaker interaction around Leu107.
This interpretation also accounts for the different slopes of the
urea denaturation curves for the constructs with a single disulfide
at position 107 versus position 54. According to the widely used Transfer
Model for protein denaturation,45 the degree
of cooperativity observed in chemical denaturation experiments, represented
by the slope factor m in eq 3, reflects the extent to which the solvent-exposed surface area of
the protein increases upon denaturation.46,47 Thus, the large slopes seen for the proteins containing only a disulfide
at 107 indicates that denaturation is accompanied by a large increase
in solvent-exposed surface area relative to the other constructs.
We therefore conclude that the difference in denaturation behavior
and ease of reduction between the NEMO constructs containing a single
disulfide at position 54 versus 107 derives from a close and favorable
contact between NEMO monomers in the region centered on residue 54,
which remains strong even when Cys54 is changed to alanine. The large
denaturation energy seen in the construct containing disulfides at
both of these positions likely has a different explanation, presumably
reflecting the fact that the denatured state in a doubly cross-linked
NEMO dimer is highly constrained and compact, and benefits from only
a fraction of the entropy gain that accompanies denaturation of the
singly cross-linked forms. Note that full-length NEMO, though constitutively
dimeric, does not have interchain disulfides in the normal reducing
environment of the cell15,28 and, therefore, the
presence of a cysteine that can be oxidized at position 54 to form
a disulfide in the dimer interface is unlikely to play a major role
in NEMO function under normal cellular conditions.

Our results additionally
provide quantitative insight into the
energetics of coiled-coil formation in the IKKβ binding domain
of NEMO, as illustrated in Figure 8. The binding
of monomeric NEMO44–111(des3C) to IKKβ can
notionally be separated into two steps: (1) association of two disordered
monomers to form an ordered noncovalent coiled-coil dimer, with free
energy ΔGDimeriz, and (2) binding
of two IKKβ molecules to this noncovalent dimer to form the
final complex. The self-association of NEMO monomers can be further
subdivided into three notional steps. 1(a) Colocalization of the monomers
into close proximity, with an energetic cost equal to the configurational
entropy cost of colocalizing two molecules from a 1 M standard state
such that their translational and overall rotational motions are coupled
(ΔSConfig). 1(b) Adoption of a fully
α-helical structure separately by each monomer, with an energy
cost for each corresponding to the inverse of the free energy of unfolding,
ΔGH2O, for NEMO44–111(des3C). 1(c) Interaction of the two α-helical monomers to
form a noncovalent, coiled-coil dimer, with the release of interaction
energy ΔGInteract. If the hypothetical
preorganized noncovalent NEMO44–111 dimer is assumed
to bind IKKβ with a similar affinity to that observed for the
disulfide-stabilized NEMO44–111 covalent dimers,
then the 20-fold difference in IKKβ binding affinity between
dimer (step 2) and monomer (labeled as step 3 in Figure 8) implies that ΔGDimeriz is small (−RT ln20 = 1.8 kcal/mol).
Given that ΔSConfig is known to
be a large number (6–12 kcal/mol48−53) and ΔGH2O is negative,
the noncovalent interaction energy between NEMO44–111 monomers, ΔGInteract, must be
considerable. Specifically, to account for the 6–30-fold difference
in IKKβ binding affinity, the NEMO monomers must interact sufficiently
strongly that approximately (1/30)–(1/6) = ∼3–15%
of the NEMO protein exists as dimer at the concentration of 0.1–1
μM at which binding is seen in our assays. Thus, even the relatively
small NEMO fragments we use here appear to show some tendency to preassociate,
presumably mediated by close and energetically favorable contacts
in the vicinity of residue 54. The interaction affinity is low, however,
and therefore under the conditions of our experiments the constructs
lacking any interchain disulfide bonds are largely monomeric, consistent
with the previously published NMR data for NEMO44–111.16 The ∼35% α-helix content
we observed with these constructs therefore presumably reflects mostly
adventitious helix formation within a monomeric polypeptide. The observation
that the shorter NEMO44–111(des3C) binds IKKβ
approximately as strongly as the longer NEMO1–120(des4C) confirms that regions outside residues 44–111 do not
significantly contribute to NEMO self-association or to IKKβ
peptide binding. The energy diagram for the longer, NEMO1–120 constructs should therefore look essentially identical to that shown
in Figure 8, as the additional residues present
in these longer constructs do not contribute to IKKβ binding
and remain largely disordered even in the bound state.

Figure 8 Energetic relationship
between NEMO–NEMO interaction and
coiled-coil formation in NEMO44–111. The binding
of monomeric NEMO44–111(des3C) to IKKβ can
notionally be separated into two steps: (1) association of two disordered
monomers to form an ordered noncovalent coiled-coil dimer, with free
energy ΔGDimeriz, and (2) binding
of two IKKβ molecules to this noncovalent dimer to form the
final complex. The self-association of NEMO monomers can be further
subdivided into three notional steps. 1(a) colocalization of the monomers
into close proximity (represented by a dashed red circle), where ΔSConfig is the configurational entropy cost of
colocalizing two molecules from a 1 M standard state such that their
translational and overall rotational motions are coupled. 1(b) adoption
of a fully α-helical structure separately by each monomer, with
an energy cost for each corresponding to the inverse of the free energy
of unfolding, ΔGH2O,
for NEMO44–111(des3C). 1(c) Interaction of the two
α-helical monomers to form a noncovalent, coiled-coil dimer,
with the release of interaction energy ΔGInteract. If the hypothetical preorganized noncovalent NEMO44–111 dimer is assumed to bind IKKβ with a similar
affinity to that observed for the disulfide-stabilized NEMO44–111 covalent dimers, then the 20-fold difference in IKKβ binding
affinity between dimer (Step 2) and monomer (Step 3) implies that
ΔGDimeriz is small (−RT ln20 = 1.8 kcal/mol). Given that ΔSConfig is known to be a large number (6–12
kcal/mol, see text) and ΔGH2O is negative, the noncovalent interaction energy between NEMO44–111 monomers, ΔGInteract, must be considerable. The energy diagram for the longer, NEMO1–120 constructs would look essentially identical to
that shown here, as the additional residues present in these longer
constructs do not contribute to IKKβ binding and remain largely
disordered even in the bound state.

Although a wide range of values have been reported for the
binding
affinity of NEMO for IKKβ,15,16,22,54,55 studies using full-length NEMO in conjunction with IKKβ701–745 peptide indicate an affinity for this interaction
in the single digit nanomolar range.22 It
is noteworthy that even our disulfide-stabilized, constitutively dimeric
N-terminal domain constructs of NEMO showed affinities that are ∼10-fold
larger than that observed for the full-length protein. There are several
possible reasons for this difference. It is unlikely that the lower
affinity results from the Cys-to-Ala changes at positions 76 or 95,
because we have previously shown that these changes in full-length
NEMO do not affect binding affinity for IKKβ701–745.15 However, one possibility is that,
notwithstanding our careful selection of the disulfide locations,
the positioning of the disulfides in our constructs is not fully compatible
with high affinity binding of IKKβ. We consider this explanation
unlikely, however, for two reasons. We have previously shown that
oxidation of Cys54 does not affect the binding affinity of full-length
NEMO for IKKβ,15 and we show here
that introduction of the L107C mutation into full-length NEMO did
not affect its ability to bind IKKβ, IκB, diubiquitin,
or TRAF6 or to mediate TNFα-induced activation of NF-κB
in cells. Furthermore, the ability of the full-length NEMO 7xAla/L107C
protein to form a covalent dimer upon treatment of cells with H2O2 supports our hypothesis that these residues
are appropriately positioned in the native structure to form an interchain
disulfide bond. Moreover, it is unlikely that attenuation of IKKβ
binding affinity of such similar magnitude would occur with two disulfides
at such different locations within the NEMO structure. Nevertheless,
even small differences in structure resulting in conformational or
dynamic constraints on the NEMO structure could account for a difference
in binding affinity of the magnitude that we observed, and therefore,
we cannot rule out this possibility. An alternative explanation for
the discrepancy in binding affinities between our constructs and full-length
NEMO is that regions of the NEMO sequence downstream of the N-terminal
120 residues are required for maximal IKKβ binding affinity.

One practical consequence of our results is to enable the identification
of forms of the NEMO N-terminal domain that would be amenable to crystallization
in the unbound state, or cocrystallization with small molecules identified
in screens for inhibitors of the IKKβ binding site on NEMO.56 In the absence of conditions for crystallizing
full-length NEMO or larger fragments that contain the IKKβ binding
domain, cocrystallizing compounds with only the IKKβ binding
region itself, as was done with IKKβ701–745,16 would appear to be the best option.
However, the high degree of disorder that these workers demonstrated
for the NEMO44–111 in the absence of IKKβ
peptide suggested that crystallization of unbound NEMO44–111 would not be possible. Nor is it likely that a weak-binding small
molecule occupying a small portion of the IKKβ binding site
would stabilize an ordered NEMO structure in the same way that the
45-mer IKKβ peptide does. Our results show that the IKKβ
binding region of NEMO can be induced to adopt a stable coiled-coil
structure in the absence of ligand, by introduction of an interchain
disulfide bond at position 54 and/or position 107, and that the resulting,
rigidified proteins are compatible with IKKβ binding and NF-κB
signaling in vivo. Given the large number of single
amino acid changes along the length of NEMO that are associated with
human disease,57 we find it surprising
that a NEMO protein with eight scattered amino acid changes (as in
L107C)) retains normal activity. However, we have only looked at the
ability of the 7xAla and L107C NEMO mutant proteins to support signaling
to NF-κB in response to TNFα, and to bind to TRAF6. Therefore,
we cannot rule out the possibility that other activities are defective
in these NEMO mutants.

Our results also suggest that the regions
of NEMO between approximately
residues 1 and 44 are disordered in our NEMO1–120 constructs both in the bound and unbound state. In the published
crystal structure of NEMO44–111 in complex with
IKKβ701–745 electron density could be resolved
only for the residues from residues 49 to 110,16 suggesting that a few additional residues could also be
dispensed with. Given the strong correlation between structural order
and the prospects for obtaining protein crystals that diffract with
high resolution, our results suggest that our shorter, disulfide-stabilized
constructs NEMO44–111(des2C/C54), NEMO44–111(des3C/L107C) and NEMO44–111(des2C/C54/L107C),
or versions of these constructs that are further truncated to remove
a small number of amino acids at the N terminus, are good candidates
for crystallization in an unbound state, and for cocrystallization
with inhibitors.
