Na+/K+-ATPase
is the energy-transducing enzyme of the plasma membrane that
catalyzes the coupled active transport of Na+ and K+ in most higher eukaryotic cells., Two
subunits of the enzyme (α and β) are essential for this
pumping function, but the α-subunit
contains the ATP binding site and the ion transport pathways. Many preparations of the enzyme from different
cell types also contain a third subunit (FXYD protein) that regulates
function.

In addition to its essential
ion pumping function, Na+/K+-ATPase may also
act as a signal transducer. When intact
cells are exposed to digitalis drugs that are known to be highly specific
inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATPase (e.g., ouabain,
digoxin, and digitoxin), a number of intracellular signaling pathways
are activated, leading to highly cell specific downstream consequences., To date, two ouabain-activated pathways that are growth-related
have been identified in a variety of cell types: the EGFR/Src–Ras–ERK
pathway and the PI3K1A–PDK–Akt pathway., In cells that are capable of proliferative growth, ouabain-induced
signaling causes either stimulation or inhibition of growth depending
on the cell type,, with unclear downstream mechanisms
for either growth stimulation or inhibition., In
the terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes where nontoxic concentrations
of ouabain cause hypertrophic growth, the two pathways are activated
in parallel, but only the PI3K1A–PDK–Akt pathway seems
to be relevant to ouabain-induced hypertrophy.,

Ouabain activation of the EGFR/Src–Ras–ERK signaling
pathway was the first to be discovered;, hence, a significant
amount of work on how it may be linked to Na+/K+-ATPase has been conducted. On the basis of the original observations
of Tian et al., a large body of subsequent
research has advanced the hypothesis that the initial event of this
drug-induced signaling is due to a normal preexisting pool of inactive
Src that is bound to intracellular domains of the α-subunit
of Na+/K+-ATPase, and that binding of ouabain
to the extracellular domains of the α-subunit leads to the disinhibition
of this Src, allowing the stimulation of the EGFR/Src–Ras–ERK
pathway and its downstream growth consequences.

There is a paucity
of experimental data about the mechanism through
which the ouabain-inhibited Na+/K+-ATPase may
lead to the activation of PI3K1A. Nevertheless, because of the repeated
advocacy of the hypothesis that a preformed complex of Src and Na+/K+-ATPase is the receptor for all ouabain-induced
signaling,− it has been tacitly assumed that this postulated Src–Na+/K+-ATPase complex also initiates the ouabain activation
of cell signaling through PI3K1A., The primary
aims of this work were the testing of this assumption and the clarification
of the mechanisms of drug-induced cell signaling through the ubiquitous
Na+/K+-ATPase.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines
SYF cells, deficient for tyrosine kinases
Src, Yes, and Fyn, and Src++ cells, a control expressing
endogenous wild-type Src but lacking expression of Yes and Fyn, were
mouse fibroblasts obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin
(100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). When cultures
reached approximately 80–90% confluence, cells were serum-starved
overnight before being used for the signaling experiments.

Adult
Mouse Cardiomyocyte Culture
Isolation and culture
of adult cardiomyocytes from cardiac specific Na+/Ca2+ exchange knockout mice were performed following the procedures
previously described., For the cell signaling experiment,
myocytes were cultured in MEM containing 2,3-butanedione monoxime
(BDM) and 1 mg/mL BSA overnight and then transferred to the same medium
without BDM before the indicated treatments.

SDS–PAGE and Western
Blot Analysis
This was
performed as previously described. Briefly,
cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed
in modified radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing
1 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin,
and 10 nM okadaic acid. Cell lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4
°C and centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min. Samples were subjected
to 8 or 10% SDS–PAGE, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed
with appropriate antibodies by standard procedures. The immunoreactive
bands were developed and detected using enhanced chemiluminescence.
For quantitative comparisons, images were scanned with a densitometer.
Different dilutions of samples were subjected to SDS–PAGE,
and multiple exposures of the films were used to ensure that quantifications
were made within the linear range of the assays. The primary antibodies
and their sources were as follows: anti-cSrc [sc-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA)], anti-PI3-kinase p110α [611398 (BD Biosciences)],
anti-PI3-kinase p85α [06-497 (EMD Millipore Corp.)], anti-phospho-Akt
[9271 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.)], anti-Akt [9272 (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.)], anti-phospho-ERK [9106 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc.)], anti-ERK [sc-94 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)], and anti-GAPDH
[sc-20357 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)]. The horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology.

PI3K1A Kinase Activity Assay
Src++ cells,
SYF cells, and mouse cardiomyocytes were cultured in 100 mm dishes.
Each sample was collected from three dishes, and the assay was conducted
as described previously. Briefly, cells
were lysed with ice-cold buffer containing 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES,
10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM
MgCl2, 2 mM Na3VO4, 10% glycerol,
1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 50 μM leupeptin,
and 2 mM PMSF (pH 8.1) and solubilized by continuous rotation for
1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (16000g for
15 min), the supernatant was collected, and equal amounts of protein
(0.5–2 mg) from control and ouabain-treated cells were incubated
with an anti-PI3K p85α antibody. After overnight incubation,
protein A-agarose was added, and the immune complex was washed four
times with buffer [100 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4,
and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)] and resuspended in 40 μL of buffer
[180 mM NaCl and 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)]. PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitates
was assayed directly on the beads by a standard procedure with phosphatidylinositol
(Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and [γ-32P]ATP
used as substrates. The reactions were performed at room temperature
and stopped after 10 min by addition of 80 μL of 1 M HCl. The
lipids were extracted with 160 μL of a chloroform/methanol mixture
(1:1), spotted on a thin-layer chromatography plate, and separated
with a chloroform/acetone/methanol/glacial acetic acid/H2O mixture (40:15:13:12:8). The radioactivity of the phosphorylated
lipid product PIP3 was quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-Triphosphate (PIP3) Immunostaining
SYF and Src++ cells cultured on coverslips were fixed
with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin.
After being blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 15 min in room
temperature, cells were incubated with mouse anti-PIP3 IgM [Z-P345
(Echelon Biosciences)] overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation
with secondary antibody Alexa 488 anti-mouse for 1 h at 37 °C.
Cell nuclei were then stained with 0.5 μg/μL propidium
iodide [P21493 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies)]
for 5 min. The fluorescence-labeled cells on microscope slides were
mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent [P36930 (Life Technologies
Corp., Invitrogen)] and sealed with nail polish. Cell images were
acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica
Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and the average intensity of
PIP3 was normalized by the number of nuclei.

Co-Immunoprecipitation
SYF and Src++ cells
were lysed in RIPA buffer. The total amount of 1.2 mg of protein as
incubated with anti-PI3-kinase p85α antibody [06-195 (EMD Millipore
Corp.)] overnight at 4 °C. Protein A agarose beads were added
for 3 h at 4 °C. The bead-bound immunocomplexes were eluted in
the sample loading buffer at 55 °C for 20 min. The supernatants
were collected and then were subjected to SDS–PAGE for Western
blot analysis. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α1 antibody [α6F (Department
of Biological Science, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA)] and
anti-PI3-kinase p85α [sc-1637 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)].

Fibroblast Proliferation Assay
SYF and Src++ cells
were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 25000 cells
per well in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. Then the cells were
incubated with 1% FBS overnight and then with and without ouabain
for an additional 12 h. After cells had been detached with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA
[25200-056 (Life Technologies Corp.)], cell numbers were counted using
a Z2 Coulter Particle Count and Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.).

Results
Ouabain-Induced
Activation of PI3K1A in SYF Cells
This
mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line lacking expression of Src, Yes,
and Fyn has been used in previous studies to explore the role of Src
in ouabain-induced stimulation of the EGFR/Src–Ras–ERK
pathway., In the following experiments, therefore,
we used the SYF and control Src++ cells to investigate
the relation of Src to ouabain-induced activation of PI3K1A.

We compared the basal levels of several signal pathway proteins that
are relevant to this study in SYF and Src++ cells using
Western blots. As expected, Src was not detected in SYF cells, but
the basal levels of Akt, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of
PI3K1A, and ERK1/2 were not significantly different in the SYF and
control cells (Figure ). We then exposed intact
SYF and Src++ cells to ouabain for 5 min, immunoisolated
PI3K1A from the lysates, and assayed its activity by a standard procedure,
measuring the product (PIP3) on TLC plates (Figure ). The results indicated that ouabain treatment of the cells
activated PI3K1A in both SYF and control cells. To see if this finding
could be confirmed by a different assay, the intact cells that were
similarly exposed to ouabain were fixed and stained with an anti-PIP3
antibody (Figure ). The results confirmed
that the level of PIP3 increased in both SYF and Src++ cells
upon exposure to ouabain (Figure A,B). Interestingly,
the basal level of PIP3 prior to ouabain exposure was lower in SYF
cells than in Src++ cells (Figure C).

Consequences of Ouabain-Induced Activation of PI3K1A in SYF
Cells
The findings described above prompted us to determine
if Src deletion affected the ouabain activation of the entire PI3K1A–PDK–Akt
pathway and its growth consequences in SYF cells. The results of the
experiments of Figure  showed that ouabain
activated Akt in both SYF and Src++ cells and that Src
inhibitor PP2 did not prevent the ouabain activation of Akt in Src++ cells. In the experiments depicted in Figure , we compared the effects of ouabain on the proliferative
growth of the SYF and Src++ cells. Because of the known
existence of signal amplification mechanisms for ouabain effects on
cell proliferation, and due to biphasic
effects of ouabain (stimulation followed by inhibition) in cell proliferation
studies, in conducting the experiments
depicted in Figure , we first determined by
preliminary experiments (data not shown) the optimal ouabain concentration
(100 nM) for stimulation and then compared its effects on the two
cell lines. The results showed significant stimulation by ouabain
in both cell lines. The combined data of Figures  and  indicated that Src was not necessary
for ouabain activation of the PI3K1A–PDK–Akt pathway
and the resulting increase in the level of proliferation of these
fibroblasts.

treatment. Akt activations were expressed by ratio of p-Akt to total
Akt (*P &lt; 0.05 and **P &lt; 0.01

Effects of Ouabain on ERK1/2
in SYF and Src++ Cells
Previous studies that have
been interpreted to support the necessity
of Src for ouabain-induced activations of ERKs were conducted with
SYF and SYF+Src cells that strongly overexpress Src., To see if similar results could be obtained with Src++ cells that contained normal Src levels, we performed the experiments
depicted in Figure . Ouabain did not activate
ERKs in SYF cells but caused activation in Src++ cells.
This activation was prevented by the Src inhibitor PP2 (Figure ).

treatment. ERK activation was assayed by the ratio of phosphorylated
ERK to total ERK (*P &lt; 0.05 vs control; n = 6–11).

Effects of Src Inhibition on Ouabain-Induced Activation of Akt
and Increase in the Level of Protein Synthesis in Adult Mouse Cardiac
Myocytes
To explore the role of Src in ouabain activation
of the PI3K1A–PDK–Akt pathway and the resulting hypertrophic
growth, we used terminally differentiated isolated adult mouse cardiac
myocytes. For these experiments, myocytes isolated from Na/Ca exchanger
1 (NCX1) knockout mouse hearts, in which ouabain induces hypertrophy
but no increase in contractility, were
used. The experiments depicted in Figure  showed
that pretreatment with Src inhibitor PP2 did not prevent ouabain-induced
activation of Akt in myocytes of NCX1 knockout mice. The results of
the experiments depicted in Figure  indicated
that PP2 was also ineffective in blocking the ouabain-induced increase
in the rate of protein synthesis in isolated myocytes. The findings
depicted in Figures  and  strengthened the conclusions of the experiments with SYF
cells, suggesting the redundancy of Src to ouabain-induced activation
of the PI3K1A–PDK–Akt pathway and its growth consequences.

with ouabain (50 μM) for 5 min (*P &lt; 0.05
vs control; n = 5).

for 4 h before the media were changed to those containing [3H]leucine. Cells that were preincubated with PP2 (2 μM) for
30 min and untreated controls were incubated with ouabain (10 μM)
for 12 h (*P &lt; 0.05 and **P &lt;
0.01 vs control; n = 4).

Effects of Ouabain on the Interaction of the α-Subunit
of Na+/K+-ATPase with the p85 Subunit of PI3K1A
in SYF Cells, Src++ Cells, and Adult Mouse Cardiac Myocytes
Ouabain-activated interaction between Na+/K+-ATPase and PI3K 1A was detected previously in neonatal rat cardiac
myocytes, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
We conducted similar studies on the mouse cells used here. Ouabain
similarly increased the level of p85 immunoprecipitation with the
α-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase in SYF cells,
Src++ cells, and adult myocytes (Figure.), indicating the irrelevance of Src to this protein–protein
interaction.

Discussion
Activation
of PI3K1A by ouabain was first reported in renal epithelial
cells in relation to control of apoptosis, then in the same cells in relation to internalization of Na+/K+-ATPase at the clathrin-coated pits, and subsequently in cardiac myocytes,, where ouabain induces hypertrophic growth that seems to be similar
to beneficial physiological hypertrophy. It is important, therefore,
to attempt to clarify the mechanism by which the ouabain-inhibited
Na+/K+-ATPase is linked to activation of PI3K1A.

PI3K1A is an obligatory dimer of p85 and p110, and its activation
reflects the reversal of the inhibitory effect of p85 on the catalytic
activity of p110 without the dissociation of the dimer., The most common way of disinhibiting the kinase is through binding
of its p85-SH2 domains to the tyrosine-phosphorylated motifs of the
receptor tyrosine kinases., There are, however,
several other established ways in which this disinhibition may occur.− One such alternative mechanism is the direct binding of the Src-SH3
domain to the proline-rich domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K1A. This
has been demonstrated to be the mechanism of activation of PI3K1A
by some extracellular signals. We were
prompted to test if Src is similarly involved in ouabain-induced activation
of PI3K1A for two reasons (1) because the complex of Src with Na+/K+-ATPase has been proposed to be the initial
target of all signaling initiated by ouabain and related digitalis
drugs, and (2) because recent evidence has led
to questions about whether there is direct contact between Src and
Na+/K+-ATPase.,

The
mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn
(SYF cells) have been used extensively to determine the possible involvement
of Src in the activation of PI3K1A by various extracellular stimuli.− SYF cells have also been used to assess the role of Src in ouabain-induced
activation of ERKs through the EGFR/Src–Ras–ERK1/2 pathway., In these prior studies, SYF+Src cells in which Src was overexpressed
were used. In the studies presented here, using SYF cells and the
appropriate control Src++ cells, we have now confirmed
the necessity of Src for ouabain-induced activation of the EGFR/Src–Ras–ERK1/2
pathway (Figure ), but we have also clearly
established that ouabain-induced activation of the PI3K1A–PDK–Akt
pathway is independent of Src (Figures –). Our findings also show that the Src-independent
activation of PI3K1A and Akt by ouabain leads to stimulation of proliferative
growth in fibroblasts (Figure ) and hypertrophic
growth in cardiac myocytes (Figure ).

If Src is unnecessary for the ouabain-induced activation of PI3K1A,
what is the mechanism of the linkage between Na+/K+-ATPase and PI3K1A? The co-immunoprecipitation experiments,
both in fibroblasts and in cardiac myocytytes (Figure ), suggest that the more likely mechanism is the direct interaction
of the p85-SH3 domain with a proline-rich domain of the α-subunit
of the ouabain-inhibited Na+/K+-ATPase (Figure ). This hypothesis is supported by numerous studies
showing that PI3K1A may indeed be activated by interactions of p85-SH3
domains with proline-rich domains of several other proteins,, and by previous data suggesting that a specific proline-rich domain
of the α-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase (TPPPTTP87) may be involved in dopamine-induced internalization of
Na+/K+-ATPase at the clathrin-coated pits. However, the working hypothesis of Figure  is far from being established because of the known
limitations of the supporting co-immunoprecipitation studies, i.e.,
the possibility that the detergents used in such studies may be inducing
the noted interaction between the denatured α-subunit and the
native PI3K1A. Further testing of the hypothesis is needed.

Postulated
domain–domain interactions of the α-subunit
of Na+/K+-ATPase and the p85 subunit of PI3KIA.

Regardless of the main implication
of these studies, the following
aspects of our findings require further discussion.

In our studies
on the effects of ouabain on SYF and Src++ cells, the ouabain
concentration (100 nM) used to detect the drug’s
stimulation of proliferation in these fibroblasts (Figure ) is significantly lower than the ouabain concentrations
(10–100 μM) used in the signaling experiments (Figures –). Such seeming
discrepancies between the ouabain sensitivities of the long-term proliferation
experiments and the short-term signaling experiments have been noted
previously and are caused by signal amplification
between receptor occupancy and the far downstream growth effects. The suggested mechanisms of this amplification
are yet to be explored.

With regard to the ouabain concentrations
(10–100 μM)
used in the signaling experiments with these fibroblast cell lines,
it is appropriate to ask if the use of such high drug concentrations
is consistent with the early data and conclusions, that
ouabain-induced signaling occurs in a manner independent of changes
in intracellular ion concentrations. Fibroblasts contain only the
α1 isoform of Na+/K+-ATPase, and the K0.5 value for the ouabain inhibition of this
rodent isoform is ≥100 μM. Considering the long-established reserved capacity of the Na+/K+-ATPase in a variety of cell types,,, showing that ∼50% inhibition
of the pump is needed before significant changes in normal Na+/K+ gradients occur, it is likely that in our present
short-term signaling experiments, there is also little or no ouabain-induced
change in Na+/K+ gradients.

Finally, it
is of special interest that in experiments depicted
in Figure  where cellular PIP3 contents were
assayed by immunostaining, we noted (Figure C) that prior to ouabain exposure, the basal level of PIP3 was lower
in SYF cells than in Src++ cells. This suggests that in
spite of the irrelevance of Src with respect to ouabain-induced activation
of PI3K1A, Src family kinases may be involved in the regulation of
the steady state levels of PIP3 by an unknown mechanism, perhaps through
the control of the lipid phosphatases that degrade PIP3.

In
conclusion, these studies clearly rule out the presumed role
of Src in ouabain-induced activation of PI3K1A and point to the necessity
of focusing on the alternative mechanisms by which digitalis drugs
activate PI3K1A and regulate several important physiological processes.
