The explosion of biological data in the
genomics era has filled databanks with large amounts of genetic information.
Understanding of these data and making correlations are vital for
maximally advancing the fields of biology and medicine. This necessitates
accurate methods in bioinformatics and computational chemistry. One
important area that bioinformatics and computational chemistry address
is finding, predicting, and determining RNA structure from sequence.

RNA participates in a variety of cellular
functions involving gene expression and regulation. RNA typically
folds in a hierarchical way., Base pairs form to generate
motifs such as helixes and loops. Higher order interactions between
these features result in three-dimensional structures. On that basis,
knowledge of secondary structure is critical for the prediction of
tertiary structure. Secondary structure prediction algorithms utilizing
experimental thermodynamic data− have relied on nearest neighbor models.− Finding regions of genome sequences
that code for structured RNA often also relies on nearest neighbor
models.,− Because RNA molecules
and their reverse complements can fold similarly, the thermodynamics
of GU pairs provides information about the reading direction because
their complement, CA, forms less stable base pairs.

Prediction of GU pairs is also important
because they are the most common non-Watson–Crick pair and
have functions in a wide variety of RNAs. For example, GU pairs are
found within two helical regions and at the junction of a helix and
multibranch loop in eukaryotic 5S rRNA., A GU pair
in the third position of the acceptor stem in tRNAAla distorts helix geometry and is important in Escherichia coli for recognition
by alanine aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.− Local helix geometry
due to a conserved GU pair may also be important for binding of a
yeast intron with hPrp8 or L32 protein., The U-rich
tail of guide RNAs bind to a purine-rich region in unedited pre-mRNA
to generate recurring 5′AGA/3′UUU motifs that may help
RNA editing proteins bind to the major groove., The 5′ leader of HIV-1 can switch between helixes containing
GU pairs to promote translation or packaging of its genome.

GU pairs expose the exocyclic amino group
of guanine in the minor groove, presenting a unique site for hydrogen
bonding to facilitate function and molecular recognition. For example,
a GU amino group at the splice site in the Tetrahymena thermophilia group I intron helps bind and align the splice site− and stabilize the transition state of the splicing reaction. Šponer et al. reported a common tertiary
interaction involving a GU pair, where the exocyclic NH2 of the G and the 2′OH of the U form hydrogen bonds, respectively,
with the 2′OH and carbonyl oxygen of a cytidine in a GC pair
of another helix.

GU pairs can
be metal ion binding sites.− Colmenarejo and Tinoco observed that Co(NH3)63+ preferably binds to 5′GU/3′UG and 5′GG/3′UU
over 5′UG/3′GU pairs, whereas Mg(H2O)62+ binds tightest to 5′UG/3′GU. This preference may explain why 5′UG/3′GU
is the most prevalent tandem GU motif in rRNA. The propensity for binding metal ions allows design of
sequences that bind heavy metals to facilitate solving of X-ray structures.,

Prediction of GU pairs often relies on a nearest neighbor
model for folding stability. The database of RNA sequences from which
GU nearest neighbor parameters were derived is relatively small, however, compared to that for Watson–Crick
nearest neighbors. To expand the database,
optical melting experiments were carried out on 29 oligoribonucleotide
duplexes. Linear regression analysis on the expanded database provides
a revised set of individual nearest neighbor (INN) parameters, which are reported herein. The parameters provide
stability increments for internal and single terminal GU pairs. Stability
increments for additional terminal GU pairs have been reported by
Nguyen and Schroeder.

Materials and Methods
Design of Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides were designed
to expand the previous database to provide
all possible combinations of base pair triplets containing GU pairs
flanked by Watson–Crick pairs in different orientations (Table ) and to have a substantial representation of each
nearest neighbor containing a GU pair. An additional six sequences
containing the 5′GG/3′UU doublet provided nine new representations
for that motif, which had only one representation. Care was taken
to select self-complementary sequences that do not favorably form
alternative secondary structures, such as hairpins or loops.

Synthesis and Purification of Oligoribonucleotides
Sequences for the following oligoribonucleotide duplexes were purchased
from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT): r(AGGCUU)2, r(AUGCGU)2, r(AGUCGAUU)2, r(CUGGCUAG)2, r(5′CAGAGGAGAC/3′GUCUUUUCUG), r(CAGUCGAUUG)2, r(CCGAAUUUGG)2, r(CGGAAUUUCG)2, r(CGGAUAUUCG)2, r(CGGGCGUUCG)2, r(CUGGAUUCAG)2, r(GAGAGCUUUC)2, r(GAGGAUCUUC)2, r(5′GAGUGGAGAG/3′CUCAUUUCUC), r(GGUUCGGGCC)2, and r(GUGAAUUUAC)2 (the / denotes
a nonself-complementary duplex). Purity was checked by NMR except
for those forming duplexes with adjacent GU pairs, which were checked
by thin layer chromatography. All other sequences were synthesized
and purified as previously described. All sequences were desalted with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges ().

UV Melting
RNA duplexes with concentrations from 10–6–10–3 M were melted in 0.5
mM Na2EDTA, 1 M NaCl, and 20 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7,
which maintains a stable pKa over a wide
temperature range. Absorbance at 280
nm, typically from 15 to 80 °C, was measured on a Beckman Coulter DU
640 spectrophotometer.

NMR Experiments
Spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova
500 or 600 MHz spectrometer. The buffer for NMR was 80 mM NaCl, 18.8
mM NaH2PO4, 1.16 mM Na2HPO4, 0.02 mM Na2EDTA, pH 6.0, to which 15 μL of D2O was added to provide a lock signal. One-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired with the water 1H signal
suppressed with a binomial 1:1 shaped pulse. Two-dimensional 1H–1H NOESY and 1H–1H TOCSY spectra were acquired with the
water signal suppressed by a WATERGATE-type pulse sequence with flipback., Two-dimensional 1H–1H NOESY spectra
for r(AUGCGU)2 were also measured in D2O.

Spectra were processed
with NMRPipe and resonances were assigned
with SPARKY. Proton chemical shifts were
referenced to a temperature-dependent water chemical shift, δ,where T is temperature in
Kelvin. The internal reference standard
for water was 2,2-dimethylsilapentate-5-sulfonic acid.

Melting Data Analysis
Melting curves for each duplex
were fit to a two-state model with MeltWin 3.5 to derive values for ΔH° and
ΔS°. The melting temperature, TM, was plotted against ln(CT/a) to provide another measure of ΔH° and ΔS°:Here R is the gas constant
(1.987 cal K–1 mol–1), CT is the total concentration of strands, and a is 1 for self-complementary duplexes and 4 for non-self-complementary
duplexes. Sequences were added to the database if ΔH° values derived from averaging fits of melting curves agreed
within 15% with these derived from eq (), consistent with the two-state model.

Linear Regression to Fit Nearest Neighbor Parameters
Nearest neighbor thermodynamic parameters were obtained with a regression
function reported by Xia et al. Matrix
calculations were performed with R and
independently verified with Mathematica 8.0 and Octave. All three software packages
yielded nearly identical results.

Terms representing free energy
contributions from non-GU nearest neighbors, that is, helix initiation
(ΔG°init), symmetry (ΔG°sym), terminal AU pairs (ΔG°term AU), and Watson–Crick
nearest neighbors (ΔG°j (WC
NN)), were subtracted from the free energy
found from the TM–1 vs
ln(CT/a) plots (ΔG°i(duplex)) to provide an experimental
free energy attributable to the GU components of each duplex:where i and j are labels for each different duplex and INN parameter,
respectively, NN stands for nearest neighbor parameter, and mij is the number of terminal
AU pairs. For example,Here, ΔG°37(GU component) contains four 5′GG/3′CU nearest
neighbors and two 5′GG/3′UU nearest neighbors. Values
for Watson–Crick nearest neighbors from Xia et al. were used because experimental measurements
on 22 duplexes not included in the fitting by Xia et al. are predicted within experimental error (). Making the new GU parameters
consistent with the Xia et al. parameters
provides compatibility with loop parameters derived with Xia et al. nearest neighbor parameters and allows easy
adoption by programs using those parameters.

Each experimental
duplex ΔG°37 was given an error
limit of ±4% to account for systematic errors unless the percent
difference between parameters found from TM–1 vs ln(CT/a) and averaged curve fits was greater. For the seven latter
cases, this percent difference was doubled to provide an error limit.
Error limits for ΔH° were assumed to be
12%. The symmetry contribution, 0.43
kcal/mol in ΔG°37, has no error and was therefore subtracted from ΔG°37 of self-complementary duplexes before
calculating the error limit.

The GU component free energies
were placed into M × 1 matrix G, where M is the
number of duplexes.S is an M × N matrix containing
the counts of each nearest neighbor doublet in a duplex, where N is
the number of GU nearest neighbor parameters being fit. GNN is an N × 1 matrix that contains
the nearest neighbor parameters to be derived from G and S.

The general law of error propagation was used to
calculate the variances for each duplex., Multiplication
of both sides of eq () by an M × M matrix, σ–1, containing the variances in the diagonals yielded error-weighted
matrices from which thermodynamic parameters were derived.The values in GNN are thus Sσ–1·Gσ. The variances of each INN parameter are obtained with singular
value decomposition (SVD) (ref (), ). Nearest
neighbor parameters for ΔH° were found
through the same process, and ΔS° parameters
were calculated from ΔS° = (ΔH° – ΔG°)/TM.

Nearest neighbor parameters for Watson–Crick
pairs were obtained from fitting published data for 112 duplexes,
which included the 90 duplexes that Xia et al. previously fit, and
22 additional duplexes (). The symmetry contribution, if present, was subtracted from each
thermodynamic parameter derived from the TM–1 vs ln(CT/a) plot. Matrix calculations were carried out as described
above to generate ΔG°37 and
ΔH° for each nearest neighbor parameter,
with all three software packages yielding similar results.

The F-test was used to test the hypothesis that a least-squares
model can fit the dependence of Gσ on Sσ and GNN., If the F-value is larger than the critical F-value
for N and N − v degrees of freedom at the 5% significance level, where N is the number of duplexes and v the number of nearest
neighbor parameters, or if the p-value is less than
0.05, then the hypothesis that there is a dependence of Gσ on GNN may be accepted.

The paired t-test was used to evaluate the significance of the differences
between predictions of thermodynamic properties with the updated parameters
and those reported by Mathews et al. and
the difference between experimental values and predictions by each
set of nearest neighbor parameters. The difference between each pair
of a set with b values of a variable, X, before and after treatment is defined as μ(XD) = μ(X1) –
μ(X2), where X2 represents the response of X1 to treatment. The null hypothesis states
that μ(XD) = 0. To test this and
the alternative hypothesis that μ(XD) ≠ 0, the mean and standard deviation of the difference between
each block of values is found.A t-ratio is defined as

If the t-ratio is
greater than t-value for (b –
1) degrees of freedom or less than its negative, then the null hypothesis
is rejected at the 0.05 significance level.

For example, in
using the paired t-test to evaluate how well experimental
ΔG°’s are predicted by nearest
neighbor parameters, b is the number of duplexes
whose ΔG°’s are being tested and XD is the difference between the predicted and
experimental ΔG° for each sequence.

The probability density function (PDF), f(t), of the Student’s t-distribution
was used as a measure of how significantly a given INN parameter contributes
to the model,, with smaller values of f(t) indicating greater contribution,where Γ is the gamma function, r = N – v degrees
of freedom and t = ΔG°j(NN)/σj(NN), that is, the quotient of the
free energy of the INN parameter over the estimate of its error. Calculations
were carried out with R using the anova
and t-test functions, and the critical t-value was determined with the qt function in R.

Results
Table  lists results
for duplexes in the database used for determination of nearest neighbor
parameters for GU pairs. Most of the duplexes are six to eight base
pairs in length and have melting temperatures in the 30–70
°C range. For the 29 new duplexes reported here, the average
difference between ΔG°37, ΔH°, and ΔS° derived from TM–1 vs ln(CT/a) plots and averaged curve fits are
2%, 7%, and 8%, respectively. Three duplexes, r(AGGCUU)2, r(AUGCGU)2, and r(GUCGUAC/), with TM’s less than 25 °C
that were included in the database of Mathews et al. were omitted from the new database. Determination of thermodynamics
from optical melting curves is difficult when the TM is less than 25 °C.

With the Exclusion of the 5′GGUC/3′CUGG Motif, the Experimental Results
Can Be Fit to a Nearest Neighbor Model
The results in Table  were fit to a nearest neighbor model for GU pairs
after subtracting contributions from Watson–Crick nearest neighbors
(eq ). This method avoids conflating thermodynamic
parameters for Watson–Crick pairs with the idiosyncrasies of
GU pairs. Published thermodynamics for duplexes with all Watson–Crick
pairs () were used
to test published parameters for Watson–Crick pairs. Fitting the expanded database of 112 duplexes
gave INN parameters within error of the values reported by Xia et
al. (Table ).
Most free energy parameters did not change by more than 0.05 kcal/mol
at 37 °C. Consequently, the GU component values were calculated
from eq () by subtracting
the previously published Watson–Crick thermodynamic values so that the GU parameters are consistent with
the widely used Watson–Crick parameters.

Values for initiation, terminal AU, and nearest
neighbors with only Watson–Crick pairs are from ref () when not in parentheses
and derived from an expanded database when in parentheses. Values
for nearest neighbors with GU pairs were derived using the Xia et
al. parameters for Watson–Crick nearest neighbors.

For fitting GU parameters, duplexes containing the
motif, 5′GGUC/3′CUGG, were excluded from the regression due to its poor fit in the nearest
neighbor model. For the other 70 duplexes,
12 GU INN parameters were initially derived by linear regression,
which included a penalty term for terminal GU pairs to correct for
the fact that two duplexes with the same nearest neighbors can have
different numbers of GU pairs and therefore different number of hydrogen
bonds. A similar term was required for terminal AU pairs. Fitting of additional parameters would not give
a unique fit. This 12 parameter fit gave
values of −0.02 ± 0.06 kcal/mol and 2.34 ± 1.17 kcal/mol
for the terminal GU penalty ΔG°37 and ΔH°, respectively (). The PDF for the terminal GU penalty
ΔG°37 and ΔH° were 0.38 and 5.6 × 10–2, respectively,
indicating that the term is not statistically significant. Therefore,
the data were fit without a terminal GU term. The resulting nearest
neighbor parameters are listed in Table .

The free energy parameters at 37 °C for 5′UG/3′AU,
5′UU/3′AG, and 5′AU/3′UG are less favorable
than previously reported by at least
0.43 kcal/mol. This corresponds to at least a factor of 2 for an equilibrium
constant at 37 °C. The ΔG°37 values for each of the tandem GU motifs are more favorable than
previously reported. The 5′UG/3′GU nearest neighbor
contributes favorably to helix stability by −0.57 kcal/mol,
whereas previous data provided an unfavorable increment of 0.30 kcal/mol. Similarly increased stability from 0.47 to −0.25
kcal/mol at 37 °C was found for 5′GG/3′UU, which
was previously represented by a single duplex (Table ).

Estimated errors of the free energy parameters for
most nearest neighbor motifs are less than 0.10 kcal/mol (Table ). The p-value for the F-test is less than 2.2 × 10–16,
indicating that there is a linear dependence of the free energy of
a duplex on the occurrence of each nearest neighbor parameter in it
at the 5% significance level. The PDF
values from the Student t-distribution (Table ) are small for ΔG°37 except for the 5′GG/3′UU
motif. The relatively large PDF for the 5′GG/3′UU motif
may be attributed to the small magnitude of its free energy and large
error compared to those of most of the other INN parameters.

Table  lists results for apparently
two-state duplexes that were omitted from the database fitted because
their TM’s are less than 25 °C.
The predicted thermodynamic parameters for r(AGGCUU)2 and r(AUGCGU)2 do not agree well with those
measured. The NMR spectra of r(AGGCUU)2 and r(AUGCGU)2 have strong H2′-H6/8 cross peaks
and a sequential H2′, H1′-H6/8 proton walk in 2D 1H–1H NMR () that indicate the duplexes adopt
a largely A-form conformation. For r(AUGCGU)2, however, the presence of
broad on-diagonal peaks and exchange cross peaks in the aromatic region
of the 2D spectra and of more imino resonances in a 1D spectrum than
the number of imino protons in the sequence indicates the presence
of alternate conformations. The presence of broad on-diagonal peaks,
particularly for A1H8 and H2, in the aromatic region of the 2D spectra
for r(AGGCUU)2 also suggests multiple conformations at 0 °C.

Table  also lists duplexes
that do not melt in a two-state manner. There are many possible reasons
for this.,− The average difference
between experimental and predicted TM for
these sequences is 10.0 °C, while the predicted free energy is,
on average, within 1.33 kcal/mol of the experimental free energy (Table ). Evidently, the INN model may provide useful predictions
for non-two-state sequences even though ΔH°
from the van’t Hoff equation is erroneous.

The Expanded Database Improves Predictions of Duplex Stability
Using the previous parameters, the
correlation coefficients between experimental values for ΔG°37, ΔH°, and
ΔS° and those predicted for the 70 duplexes
in Table  are 0.89, 0.86, and 0.85, respectively.
Comparisons of the values of ΔG°37, ΔH°, and ΔS°
of the 70 duplexes as predicted with the previous parameters, and those in Table yielded,
respectively, means of the differences of −0.36 kcal/mol, −1.75
kcal/mol, and −4.5 eu. The paired t-test gives t-values of −3.386, −2.528, and −2.257,
respectively, which have absolute magnitudes greater than 1.995, indicating
that the two sets of parameters differ with a significance level of
0.05 for 69 degrees of freedom. Furthermore,
the respective p-values of 1.2 × 10–3, 1.4 × 10–2, and 2.7 × 10–2 are less than 0.05. This again indicates that the new parameters
predict the thermodynamics of RNA duplexes significantly differently
from those published previously.

Using the set of GU parameters in Table , the correlation coefficients between experimental values for ΔG°37, ΔH°, and
ΔS° and those predicted for the 70 duplexes
in Table  are 0.95, 0.89, and 0.87, respectively.
Comparison of experimental values of ΔG°37, ΔH°, and ΔS° of the 70 duplexes and those predicted with the set of GU
parameters in Table  yielded means of differences
of −0.05 kcal/mol, 0.58 kcal/mol, and 2.1 eu and t-values of −0.544, 0.590, and 0.686, respectively, which have
absolute magnitudes less than 1.995. The corresponding p-values of 0.59, 0.56, and 0.50 are greater than 0.05. These results
show that the thermodynamic properties predicted with the new INN
parameters are not significantly different from experiment. The same analysis yielded means of differences
of −0.41 kcal/mol, −1.17 kcal/mol, and −2.4 eu
and t-values of −2.752, −1.096, and
−0.736, with corresponding p-values of 7.6
× 10–3, 0.28, and 0.46 for ΔG°37, ΔH°, and ΔS°, respectively, when experimental properties were
compared with predicted properties using previous parameters. Evidently, the expanded database provides
improved modeling of the thermodynamics of GU pairs.

The Nearest Neighbor Model Is Not Perfect
While the
nearest neighbor model predicts well the ΔG°37 for most of the duplexes in Table , there are likely to be other terms that partially control
stability. For example, there are four duplexes, r(GGCGUC)2, r(AGUCGAUU)2, r(UCACGUGG)2, and r(CCGAAUUUGG)2 with predicted ΔG°37 values not within 1.0 kcal/moland
20% of the 1/TM vs ln(CT/a) experimental values. No pattern
is evident for these duplexes. A series of 1D spectra were acquired
for r(CCGAAUUUGG)2 at different temperatures (Figure ) because its predicted free energy is 1.5 kcal/mol more favorable
at 37 °C than measured. These spectra show that the imino protons
of all but U8, which is in the GU pair, and G10, which is in the terminal
base pair disappear with each other, consistent with the duplex melting
in a two-state manner. The results suggest that the nearest neighbor
model does not include all factors that determine stabilities of duplexes
with GU pairs.

1D 1H imino spectra of r(CCGAAUUUGG)2 from 0 to 45 °C.

The expanded database allows preliminary testing
of models beyond the nearest neighbor model. For example, terminal
GU pairs could be considered separately and a base pair triplet model used for internal GU pairs. Comparison
of measured values of ΔG°37 for terminal GU pairs with those predicted from the parameters in
Table  give a standard deviation within 0.30
kcal/mol at 37 °C (). For the 16 triplets, 5′WGY/3′XUZ, with WX and YZ
as Watson–Crick pairs, 12 measured ΔG°37(GU component) values are within 0.5 kcal/mol
of the predicted values and the others within 1.0 kcal/mol (). The nearest neighbor
model is apparently a reasonable approximation, and considerably more
data would be required to develop a triplet model.

One clear
exception to the nearest neighbor model is multiple terminal GU pairs. Thus, the parameters in Table  cannot be used beyond the first terminal GU pair at a helix
end. Parameters for additional terminal GU pairs have been published
by Nguyen and Schroeder.

Imino Proton NMR Spectra of Several Duplexes Are Consistent
with the Expected Base Pairing
To check for expected base
pairing, NMR imino proton spectra were measured for 12 duplexes. All
had chemical shifts from 10 to 15 ppm (Figure ). Chemical shifts for GH1 and UH3 of GU pairs were relatively upfield
(10–12 ppm), consistent with expectations. Chemical shifts for UH3 in AU pairs resonated between 13
and 15 ppm and GH1 in GC pairs resonated from 12 to 13.5 ppm, as expected., The absence of an imino peak for a terminal base pair in r(CUGGCUAG)2 indicates
exchange with water. The G3-H1 and U7–H3 resonances of r(CUGGAUUCAG)2 appear to
overlap, as evident by the presence of a single large peak. These
chemical shift signatures show that the RNA sequences form the expected
duplexes.

were acquired at 0 °C for r(AGGCUU)2 and r(AUGCGU)2; 1 °C for r(AGUCGAUU)2; 5 °C for others.

Discussion
GU pairs are the most common non-Watson–Crick
base pairs in RNA structures. Thus, the thermodynamics of GU pairs
are important for finding regions of RNA that are structured,,−, predicting the secondary
structure or determining structure on
the basis of chemical modification, and/or NMR
data.

GU pairs can serve as binding
sites for proteins or metal ions and participate in tertiary interactions., Thus, a better characterization of the thermodynamic properties
of GU pairs can improve prediction of secondary and tertiary structure
and help predict binding sites for metal ions and target sites for
therapeutics. For example, GU pairs in group I introns can bind cations,
including Mg2+, Co3+, and Os3+.,,, Divalent metal ion binding by GU pairs, which have greater negative
potential in the major groove than other base pairs, was postulated
as important for activating RNA catalysis. Divalent ions that interact with a GU pair help catalyze splicing
by group I and group II introns− and cleavage by HDV ribozyme. Metal
ion binding with RNA neutralizes negative potential, which may promote
higher order RNA folding. The 5′GG/3′UU
and 5′GU/3′UG motifs particularly contain greater negative
potential in the major groove than their Watson–Crick counterparts.

Not including sequences containing the 5′GGUC/3′CUGG motif, the database
in Table  expands from 35 to 70 the duplexes
used to fit nearest neighbor parameters for GU pairs. This expansion
includes published data not included in the original database,− along with 29 new measurements (Table ). Two of the original 35 duplexes were removed from the database
because their melting temperatures were below 25 °C, which makes
it difficult to analyze the melting curves. A third duplex, r(AUCUAGGU)2, was omitted
because two-state melting could not be confirmed. The expanded database
contains GU pairs flanked by Watson–Crick pairs in all possible
orientations (Table ). The new set of GU INN
parameters were obtained with consideration for propagated errors
from experiment and from Watson–Crick nearest neighbor parameters.
Errors for the free energies of individual nearest neighbors were
less than 0.2 kcal/mol for tandem GU pairs and 0.1 kcal/mol for other
GU motifs. The 5′GG/3′UU motif, which was previously
represented by a single sequence, was added to the fitting. The favorable
free energy of −0.25 ± 0.16 kcal/mol for 5′GG/3′UU
is in better agreement with the value of −0.5 kcal/mol used
by Mathews et al. to optimize secondary
structure prediction than with the previous single experimental measurement
of 0.47 kcal/mol.

GU Pairs Are Generally Less Stable than GC and AU Pairs
The free energies of formation for many of the duplexes with GU pairs
(Table ) can be compared with the free energies
when the U or G of the GU pairs is replaced with a C or A, respectively,
to form GC or AU pairs (Table ). Because many
of the latter duplexes terminated with a 3′ phosphate, the
comparisons assume that the 3′ phosphate has negligible effect
on ΔG°37 at 1 M NaCl., Duplexes containing GC pairs in place of GU pairs are more stable
at 37 °C by 1.8 ± 0.8 kcal/mol per GU pair (Table ). This is presumably due to the presence of an
additional hydrogen bond in GC pairs and unfavorable backbone distortion
due to GU pairs. Terminal substitutions all have a less than average
effect while internal substitutions have a larger than average effect,
as expected if backbone distortion is less important for a terminal
GU.

The effect of replacing GU with GC pairs can be compared
to replacing AU pairs with GC pairs (). On average, replacing an AU pair with a GC pair
stabilized a duplex by 1.5 ± 0.4 kcal/mol per AU pair. In this
case, there was no apparent difference between terminal and internal
substitutions.

Duplexes containing AU pairs in place of GU pairs
are more stable at 37 °C by 0.6 ± 0.7 kcal/mol per GU pair
(Table ). While the difference is zero within
the standard deviation, in only 2 of 11 cases is the GU duplex more
stable than the AU duplex and in both cases the difference is within
the experimental error of 4%.

Unlike terminal AU pairs, no penalty
for terminal GU pairs is required to account for base pair composition.
The terminal AU penalty of 0.45 kcal/mol at 37 °C was considered
to account for numbers of base pairing hydrogen bonds. Thus, the penalty for terminal GU pairs was assumed to
be equal to that of AU pairs, consistent
with wobble GU pairs at the end of a helix having two hydrogen bonds. When the terminal GU parameter was included
in the reparameterization of GU nearest neighbor thermodynamic parameters,
the free energy of each nearest neighbor parameter differed by no
more than 0.01 kcal/mol from that calculated without it (Table  and ). The lack of a terminal GU penalty may arise from the flexibility
of a terminal GU pair which allows optimization of hydrogen bonding
and stacking interactions without incurring the energetic penalty
associated with an interior GU distorting the backbone. For example, even for an internal GU pair, optimal
stability may be found with only one hydrogen bond due to stacking
energies., Thus, flexibility of terminal GU’s
may compensate for the difference between the free energy of formation
of two and three hydrogen bonds in GU and GC pairs, respectively.

Tandem GU Pairs Have Structural Features That Correlate with
Their Thermodynamic Properties
With the exception of 5′GGUC/3′CUGG, the 5′UG/3′GU
motif is more stable than 5′GU/3′UG (Table ). Available structures show that 5′UG/3′GU
contains interstrand stacking between the guanines,− whereas 5′GU/3′UG
does not.,, The favorability
of the 5′UG/3′GU motif relative to the 5′GU/3′UG
motif is consistent with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that predict a one hydrogen bond GU pair predominates in duplexes containing the 5′GU/3′UG
motif while a two hydrogen bond model predominates in duplexes containing
the 5′UG/3′GU motif. There is also less overlap of negative
potentials in 5′UG/3′GU than in 5′GU/3′UG. In two different sequences containing the 5′UG/3′GU
motif, there is also intrastrand stacking between each GU pair and
its Watson–Crick neighbors., By comparison,
the 5′GU/3′UG motif contains less overlap between the
GU pairs and Watson–Crick purine neighbors, but has intrastrand
stacking between the tandem GU pairs. Furthermore, the 5′UG/3′GU motif preserves the A-form
of RNA more than 5′GU/3′UG.

The 5′GGUC/3′CUGG motif is an exception to the above generalizations.
NMR spectra and modeling indicate that the GU pairs of r(GAGGUCUC)2 contain two hydrogen bonds, whereas the GU pairs in r(GGCGUGCC)2 contain only one hydrogen bond. This difference would contribute to the favorable free
energy of 5′GGUC/3′CUGG compared to that of 5′GU/3′UG in other
contexts, such as 5′CGUG/3′GUGC. Pan et al. saw similar hydrogen-bonding scenarios
in MD simulations. Additional stability
for the 5′GGUC/3′CUGG motif may also be conferred from less overlap of
its negative electrostatic potentials between a GC and GU pair than
for its related motif, 5′CGUG/3′GUGC. These patterns may
explain the poor fit of nearest neighbor parameters for the 5′GU/3′UG
motif when duplexes containing the 5′GGUC/3′CUGG motif are included in the
fit. Alternatively, the extra stability of the 5′GGUC/3′CUGG motif over 5′CGUG/3′GUGC may arise from
poor cross-strand overlap between the U in a GU pair and the C in
its neighboring GC pair in 5′CGUG/3′GUGC. Stacking interactions
alone do not contribute to the stability of nearest neighbor motifs
comprised of the same base pairs, however, as evident from the comparable
stability of 5′UG/3′GU and 5′GG/3′UU.
This contrasts with the expectation that the free energy of 5′GG/3′UU
is between the other tandem GU motifs because its base stacking is
intermediate among them. Understanding
the interactions responsible for the observed sequence dependence
of thermodynamics presents a challenge to computational chemists.

GU Pairs of RNA Are More Stable than GT Pairs of DNA
Comparison of ΔG°37 values
for GT nearest neighbors in DNA with
those measured for GU nearest neighbors show that GT nearest neighbors
are on average 0.84 ± 0.36 kcal/mol less stable than their GU
counterparts. The extra stability of GU relative to GT is also evident
from comparisons of ΔG°37 (GU
or GT component) for duplexes containing comparable triplet motifs
(Table ). This may reflect a possible hydrogen
bond between the amino group of guanine and the O2′ of uracil, which is not possible with DNA. MD simulations
utilizing residual dipolar coupling (RDC) restraints suggest that
the 5′TG/3′GT motif contains a bifurcated hydrogen bond similar to that in the 5′GU/3′UG
motif., Another difference between GT and GU is
that the 5′GGTC/3′CTGG motif fits the nearest neighbor parameters for the
5′GT/3′TG motif better than their respective uracil-substituted
RNA motifs. Consistent with the relative
stabilities of GT and GU nearest neighbors, component free energies
of GT pairs in duplexes are consistently less favorable than those
of GU pairs flanked by the same Watson–Crick pairs (Table ).
