In 1992,
Potts and co-workers discovered in the
cyanobacterium Nostoc
commune a gene encoding a product resembling protozoan and
mammalian myoglobins. It was remarkable that a protein commonly associated
with dioxygen transport was found in cyanobacteria and intriguing
that the gene was located within a nitrogen fixation operon. Subsequent
investigations have provided evidence that N. commune “cyanoglobin” belongs to a distinct and well-represented
lineage of the hemoglobin (Hb) superfamily, which has been given the general name of truncated hemoglobins (TrHbs)
in reference to their primary structures containing ∼30 fewer
amino acids than myoglobin (Mb). N. commune cyanoglobin
is thought to be involved in dioxygen scavenging, presumably to protect
the nitrogenase from oxidative damage.

Shortly after the discovery of cyanoglobin, two light-induced
TrHb
genes, LI410 and LI637, were found
in the unicellular photosynthetic eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas
eugametos (moewusii). Crystallization and subsequent structure determination
of the globin domain of the LI637 gene product (hereafter
CtrHb) provided the first glimpse of a TrHb fold. The heme group is buried in the protein, which adopts a
two-on-two helical topology resulting from the shortened sequence.
LI637, a protein targeted to the chloroplast, was one of the first
TrHbs to be studied in vivo. Protection against oxidative
damage was also proposed as a function for this Hb.

Genes encoding proteins containing one or more Hb
domains are present
in virtually all forms of life and occur in three distinct lineages,
including the TrHb family. Recent genome
analyses show a preponderance of TrHbs in cyanobacteria and green
algae. The phylogenetic data support the
rise of TrHbs soon after the appearance of life on this planet, emerging
perhaps 3 billion years ago., During this early phase
of life on Earth, atmospheric dioxygen levels were low (10–6 atm). Elevation of the dioxygen level resulted from subsequent geological
upheaval and the evolution of photosynthesis roughly 2 billion years
ago., Given that the TrHb scaffold was formed
long before the development of our current aerobic environment, an
attractive original role for these proteins is dioxygen detoxification,
as put forth for the modern N. commune and C. eugametos proteins.

The search for globin physiological
functions in unicellular photosynthetic
organisms is further guided by the observation that many Hbs (including
members of the TrHb family) are capable of reacting with nitrogen–oxygen
compounds such as nitric oxide (NO•),, nitrite, and peroxynitrite. The reactions
include oxidation, e.g., generation of nitrate from nitric oxide by
oxy Hb; reduction, e.g., formation of nitric oxide from nitrite by
deoxy Hb; and isomerization, e.g., conversion of peroxynitrite to
nitrate by ferric (met) Hb, each process depending on the redox and
ligation state of the protein. Such chemical versatility can be attained
by alterations of the heme environment without disruption of the fold. Reactive nitrogen
species (RNS) are present in and around photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria
as products of enzymes involved in nitrite or nitrate reduction; they
also are produced in the diffusion-limited reaction of NO• and superoxide, a reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, deoxygenation
and RNS regulation are conceivable functions for TrHbs in these organisms.

Among RNS, NO• is a focus of Hb research as these
proteins are generally capable of NO• dioxygenation., The overall NO• dioxygenase (NOD) reaction can
be summarized as

To
undergo multiple turnovers, the protein must be re-reduced to
the O2-binding competent ferrous state (step 4). Unlike
the flavohemoglobins, which contain a flavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD) binding domain that allows for efficient heme redox cycling, proteins such as THB1 would require intermolecular
electron transfer to accomplish this last step.

NO• plays a role as a signaling molecule in a
variety of cellular processes, including several in the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a close relative of C.
eugametos. Specifically in the former, NO• inhibits the import of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, and also
nitrate reductase activity. These observations support the idea that
NO• can regulate the assimilation of nitrogen and direct attention to the possible involvement
of globins in processes related to NO•.

Several
TrHb genes have been identified within the nuclear genome
of C. reinhardtii. Following the current UniProtKB
annotations, these are designated THB1–THB4, but at least 10 putative genes may contain TrHb domains. Most C. reinhardtii TrHbs are
hypothetical proteins. Exceptions are the products of “THB8”, the level of expression of which is increased
&gt;1000-fold under anoxic conditions, and “THB7” and “THB12”, which display
mild upregulation under hypoxic conditions. These proteins have not been characterized fully, and the chemistry
associated with them is unclear. Recently, the gene product of THB1 has been identified in in vivo work
focused on intraflagellar transport (IFT) and the BBSome, an IFT cargo
adaptor. In this case, as well, functional
information is missing.

Knowledge of amino acid sequences and in vitro properties far exceeds physiologic data for the
TrHbs of cyanobacteria
and unicellular photosynthetic algae. In fact, it has been difficult to obtain biological information
in part because these globins occur at relatively low levels and are
generally not essential under most growth conditions. THB1 offers
a rare opportunity to explore the properties of a TrHb and connect in vitro and in vivo information in a model
organism. With the goals of testing specific functional hypotheses
and relating in vivo and in vitro data, we report on the structure and reactivity of the purified
recombinant protein and demonstrate the possible involvement of the
protein in nitrogen metabolism.

Materials and Methods
Chlamydomonas Cell Culture
Strains
CC-125, CC-1086, CC-1690, and CC-2453 were obtained through the Chlamydomonas
Resource Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN). Strains g1
and bbs4-1 were from the Witman lab. Cells were maintained
on tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium agar plates until the cells
were used. Liquid cell cultures were grown in Sager-Granick M medium,, unless noted otherwise, at 20 °C under constant agitation and
illuminated with cool white fluorescent light on a 14/10 (on/off)
cycle to synchronize cell growth. For flagella isolation experiments,
cells were aerated by being bubbled with 5% CO2 and 95%
air.

Antibody Production, Protein Analysis, and Gene Expression
Polyclonal antibodies were prepared using the synthetic peptide
AADTAPADSLYSRC, which corresponds to the first 13 amino acids of THB1
(excluding the initial Met) followed by a single cysteine for covalent
attachment to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein. Antibodies
were raised in rabbit (Covance, Princeton, NJ), affinity purified
using the same synthetic peptide, and stored frozen at a protein concentration
of approximately 1.5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) until
they were used.

Whole cell protein was extracted from actively
growing cultures of C. reinhardtii by resuspending
approximately 1 × 107 cells/mL in 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.0), 10% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
(TCEP, BondBreaker, Thermo Scientific), followed by boiling for 10
min and separating the protein on a 16.5% Tris-tricine SDS–polyacrylamide
gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). For silver staining, gels
were fixed and stained according to manufacturer’s protocol
(Silver Stain Plus Kit, Bio-Rad). Flagellar isolation was performed
using the dibucaine method as previously described. In these experiments, whole cell samples were collected
immediately prior to dibucaine treatment. After flagellar abscission,
cell bodies were separated from flagella by centrifugation (3 min
at 1150g). Concentrated whole flagella and corresponding
whole cell and cell body proteins were separated on 4 to 15% Mini-PROTEAN
TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For Western blots, the proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose (Whatman), blocked with dry milk,
probed with appropriate antibodies, and detected using chemiluminescence.
Rabbit polyclonal antisera (and dilutions) were anti-PLD (1:5000), anti-BBS4 (1:2000), and anti-βF1-ATPase (1:80000). Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were anti-IC2 (1:400) and anti-IFT139 (1:20).

For gene expression analysis, total cell RNA was extracted
from
actively growing cells using the RNeasy Plant RNA extraction kit with
optional on-column DNA digest (Qiagen), and the quantity and purity
of RNA were determined using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific). cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA using an iScript
cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using PrimeTime quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) probes (Table S1 of the ) and 1× SsoFast Probes
Supermix (Bio-Rad) on a Bio-Rad CFX Real Time Detection system using
40 cycles of 10 s, 95 °C melt steps and 20 s, 60 °C elongation
steps per cycle. Normalized gene expression was calculated from biological
duplicates performed in triplicate wells and normalized relative to
the expression of the CBLP control gene using CFX Manager.

Recombinant Protein Production
The coding sequence
for the THB1 gene was obtained from GenBank (EU095254.1) and used to create a synthetic gene that was inserted into the
pJExpress414 plasmid after codon optimization for expression in a
bacterial host system (DNA 2.0, Menlo Park, CA). Recombinant THB1
(below termed rTHB1) was obtained as described previously for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 GlbN. As in this case, overexpression results in the production of the
apoprotein, which fractionates into inclusion bodies. Following urea
solubilization and gel filtration chromatography, the holoprotein
was prepared by addition of excess hemin (Sigma) to refolded apoprotein,
further purified by anion exchange chromatography, and lyophilized
for storage at −20 °C as necessary.

Mass spectrometry
was performed on an Acquity/Xevo-G2 UPLC-MS instrument (Waters) and
returned a molecular mass of 14564 Da for purified rTHB1, in excellent
agreement with the mass of 14564.4 Da expected for the polypeptide
lacking the initial methionine. The protein concentration was determined
on a per-heme basis with an extinction coefficient at 409 nm of 125
mM–1 cm–1 (ferric state, pH 7.0)
obtained by the hemochromogen assay., The apoprotein
extinction coefficient was estimated to be 5.96 mM–1 cm–1 on the basis of the amino acid composition.

Plasmids for Y29F and K53A rTHB1 production
were obtained via QuikChange
(Qiagen) mutagenesis of the pJexpress414 plasmid containing the codon-optimized THB1 gene as per manufacturer’s instructions. Primers
were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Sequencing
was performed by GENEWIZ, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ). Overexpression
and purification of the Y29F and K53A variants were performed in the
same manner as for wild-type rTHB1.

O2 Scavenging
and Reduction Systems
When
solutions needed to be scrubbed of dissolved O2, the protein
was incubated, and data were collected in the presence of the coupled
glucose oxidase/catalase oxygen-scavenging system (GODCAT). Final concentrations of the various components
were 16.7 mM d-(+)-glucose (Amresco, Solon, OH), 0.02 mg/mL
bovine catalase (Sigma), and 0.04 mg/mL Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase (Sigma).

When dithionite (DT) (Alfa Aesar,
Ward Hill, MA) was not appropriate for reduction of the ferric protein,
a ferredoxin (Fd)/NADP+ reductase system was used. Final concentrations of the various components
(all from Sigma) were 0.04 mg/mL bovine catalase, 2.8–3.0 mM
glucose 6-phosphate, 10 μM NADPH, catalytic amounts of Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
catalytic amounts of spinach Fd/NADP+ reductase, and 30
μg/mL spinach Fd.

pH Titration of Ferric and Ferrous rTHB1
by Absorption Spectroscopy
The pH titration of ferric wild-type
rTHB1 was obtained with a
sample (15 μM) in 5 mM phosphate (pH 11.0). Spectra were obtained
from 700 to 260 nm in ∼0.2 pH unit decrements achieved by adding
0.1 or 1 M HCl until a pH of 4.0 was reached. Complementary data were
obtained from two separate titrations (acid range from pH 7.2 to 3.0
and base range from pH 7.2 to 13.0). The pH titration of ferric Y29F
rTHB1 was obtained in a similar fashion in the pH ranges of 7.4–10.2,
7.4–3.3, and 9.0–14. A coarse pH titration of ferric
K53A rTHB1 was performed between pH 4.8 and 10.2 in ∼1 pH unit
increments. Data from ferric wild-type and Y29F rTHB1 between pH 5
and 10 over the 430 and 700 nm range were subjected to singular-value
decomposition using SciLab. Global fitting
of significant vectors was performed with Savuka.

The pH titration of ferrous wild-type rTHB1 was obtained
from separate samples for each pH value from pH 4 to 10.8. Each sample
contained ∼7 μM ferric rTHB1 in 100 mM buffer; different
buffers were used depending on the desired pH (acetate/phosphate for
pH 4.0–6.3, phosphate for pH 6.5–8, borax for pH 8.3–9.0,
and glycine for pH 9.5–10.5). Spectra for each sample in the
ferric state were collected prior to reduction to determine the concentration
of the protein using the pH-dependent extinction coefficient determined
in the ferric rTHB1 titration. Ferrous rTHB1 was then obtained by
adding 2 mM DT to the sample, and the reduction was monitored as a
function of time. Data points to form the titration curve were collected
when the Soret band displayed maximal absorbance. The change in absorbance
with time suggested damage to the protein caused by DT. The data may
not correspond to a true equilibrium titration and are therefore less
accurate than in the ferric state.

Ligand Binding Studies
Lyophilized ferric rTHB1 was
dissolved in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) to generate a concentrated
stock of the protein (∼2 mM). From this stock, samples containing
∼8 μM rTHB1 were prepared for the collection of absorbance
spectra. The cyanomet complex (i.e., the ferric protein with cyanide
bound as the distal ligand) was obtained by addition of a 5-fold excess
of KCN. The ferric–NO• adduct [Fe(II)–NO+] was prepared by addition of a 130-fold excess of NO• as released by 6-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-nitrosohydrazino)-N-methyl-1-hexanamine (MAHMA-NONOate, Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI). In both cases, spectra were recorded until saturation
was observed. The ferrous state was generated by incubation of the
rTHB1 sample with GODCAT prior to the addition of DT. The ferrous
cyano complex was obtained by reduction of the cyanomet complex with
excess DT; likewise, the ferrous NO• adduct [Fe(II)–NO]
was obtained by DT reduction of the ferric NO• adduct.
O2- and CO-bound rTHB1 samples were generated in buffer
sparged with either O2 (Air Gas, research grade, 99.999%
pure) or CO gas (Air Gas, chemically pure grade, 99.5% pure) and reduced
with either the Fd/NADP+ reduction system or DT in the
presence of GODCAT, respectively.

Nitric Oxide Dioxygenase
and Griess Assays
The procedure
used MAHMA-NONOate as the NO• donor and the Fd/NADP+ reductase system for rTHB1 reduction. Specifically, ∼10
μM rTHB1 samples were prepared from a concentrated rTHB1 stock
in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) equilibrated with air (∼21%
O2, 230 μM). The components of the Fd/NADP+ reduction system were added except for Fd, and a reference UV–vis
spectrum of ferric rTHB1 was collected. Approximately 30 μg
of Fd was added (2.5 μM Fd, final concentration) to the sample,
which resulted in observable Fd-mediated rTHB1 reduction. Absorbance
data were collected from 600 to 300 nm every minute, with a scan rate
of 600 nm/min.

Once rTHB1 was saturated with O2,
MAHMA-NONOate, quantitated by absorption spectroscopy at high pH (ε250 = 7.25 mM–1 cm–1), was added to the sample to generate 2 or 3 equiv
of NO•. The dead time for manual mixing was 15 s,
after which the reaction of NO• with oxy rTHB1 was
followed. Once the sample had recovered to the oxy state, a new addition
of MAHMA-NONOate was made, and this protocol was repeated a total
of five to eight times. As a control, a second sample containing buffer
and the Fd/NADP+ reductase system was prepared with no
rTHB1 present (“–THB1”) and was treated in the
same manner as the sample containing rTHB1 (“+THB1”).
Horse skeletal muscle Mb (Sigma) was subjected to an analogous procedure
for the purpose of comparison. The kinetics of MAHMA-NONOate decomposition
were determined in an independent experiment and yielded a half-life
of 2–3 min at pH 7 (not shown).

Nitrite was quantitated
at the end of each experiment using the
Griess assay. The NOD reaction mixtures
were split into two fractions to which 4 μM FAD (final concentration)
was added. To one of these samples was added A. niger nitrate reductase (NR, Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.075
unit/mL along with an NADPH regeneration system to convert nitrate into nitrite stoichiometrically. After
∼20 min, both samples were treated with the Griess reagents
(GR) as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY). Absorbance spectra were collected from 600 to 300
nm every minute until complete conversion was reached by the sample
containing the largest amount of nitrite (20−50 min). Nitrite
concentrations were obtained from a calibration curve produced under
the same conditions that were used for the NOD reaction and yielded
an ε520 of 26.9 μM–1 cm–1 for the diazonium product. The same protocol was
used to determine the amount of nitrate produced in NOD reactions
in the presence of horse skeletal muscle Mb. Kinetic simulations were
performed with KinTek Explorer.

UV–Visible
Spectrophotometry
Absorbance spectra
were collected on either a Varian Cary-50 or an AVIV 14DS instrument.
For extinction coefficient measurement, pyridine hemochrome spectra
were acquired in triplicate, from 600 to 500 nm in 1 nm steps, using
a 1 s averaging time per step. Ligand binding, NOD, and Griess assays
were monitored using the Cary50 scanning kinetics mode. Optical spectra
were collected using an averaging time of 0.1 s, from 700 to 300 nm,
every 60 s, until sample equilibration was achieved.

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR data were acquired at 14.1 T with
a Bruker Avance or Avance II spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic
acid through the temperature-corrected 1H2O
line (4.76 ppm at 298 K). 13C and 15N chemical
shifts were referenced indirectly in accordance with their respective
Ξ ratios. NMR data were processed
using NMR Pipe 3.0 or TopSpin 2.1 (Bruker
BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Analysis of NMR spectra was completed
using Sparky 3.

Unlabeled or uniformly 15N-labeled rTHB1 samples were exchanged from 50 mM Tris purification
buffer into 300 μM phosphate or 20 mM phosphate (pH 7.5–8.0,
10% 2H2O) and first examined in the ferric state
in the absence of an exogenous ligand. Ferric wild-type, Y29F, and
K53A rTHB1 samples ranged from 500 μM to 3 mM heme in 270–600
μL at pH 7.0–7.6. Initial 1H spectra were
collected at either 298 or 308 K over a large spectral width to detect
high-spin species. An increased population of the high-spin form of
ferric rTHB1 was achieved by lowering the sample pH to 5.4 at 298
K.

To generate the ferrous state of wild-type, Y29F, and K53A
rTHB1,
a ∼2 mM protein solution [25 mM borate (pH 9.1–9.5)]
was placed in a glovebox under a continuous Ar (AirGas purity 4.8)
stream. After approximately 10 min, the protein was reduced with 2.5
molar equiv of DT. The solution was transferred to an NMR Shigemi
tube, and the tube was sealed with Parafilm. Samples produced in this
manner remained completely reduced over the time scale of NMR data
acquisition (days to weeks). Ferrous 15N-labeled WT and
unlabeled Y29F and K53A rTHB1s were investigated by collecting one-dimensional
(1D) 1H spectra with water presaturation. 1H–15N HSQC, 1H–15N histidine selective
long-range HMQC data were collected on the wild-type protein, and
homonuclear two-dimensional (2D) NOESY and DQF-COSY data were acquired
on the Y29F variant as described previously.

For electron self-exchange (ESE) measurements, a 1.8 mM sample
of ferric wild-type [15N]rTHB1 in 250 mM borate (pH 9.2)
and a 10% 2H2O/90% 1H2O mixture was incubated with GODCAT and purged with Ar as described
above. A substoichiometric amount of DT was added, resulting in a
mixture containing ferric and ferrous protein in an ∼2.2:1
ratio. As estimated by the relative integrated intensities of resolved
amide signals in relaxed 1H–15N HSQC
spectra, the ferrous and ferric populations remained stable over the
course of 24 h (final ferric:ferrous ratio of ∼2.6:1).

The kinetics of ESE were estimated on a mixture of ferric and ferrous
rTHB1 using a 1H–(NZ)–1H ZZ exchange experiment. The sample was initially screened by comparing
standard 15N–1H HSQC data with a 15N–(NZ)–1H 2D ZZ exchange
spectrum (ZZ mixing time of 452 ms) recorded as detailed previously. The small difference in 15N shifts
between ferrous and ferric forms necessitated the use of 1H–(NZ)–1H 2D ZZ exchange data., NZ ZZ mixing times were 452, 271, 701, 158, 565, 362,
1018, and 452 ms. 1HZ–15NZ heteronuclear cross-relaxation was minimized with 1.3 ms
G3 1H inversion pulses every 10 ms during the NZ mixing time; these pulses were applied 2800 Hz downfield of the 1H2O line to limit the saturation of water magnetization,
which was maintained at equilibrium during the ZZ period. Because
of the low cross-peak intensity and sample variation with time, the
data provide an estimate of the lower limit of the kinetics of ESE.

The cyanomet state of rTHB1 was prepared by incubation of ferric
rTHB1 with a 1.5–6-fold molar excess of potassium cyanide for
at least 30 min prior to data acquisition. Cyanomet wild-type rTHB1
samples were prepared at pH 7.5; protein concentrations ranged from
2 to 5.5 mM in either 10% or 99.9% 2H2O solutions.
Data were acquired at 298 K. 1H homonuclear data (1D, NOESY,
and DQF-COSY) and natural abundance 1H–13C HMQC data were collected on both wild-type and Y29F rTHB1 under
similar conditions. In addition, wild-type rTHB1 was studied using 1H–1H TOCSY, 1H–15N HSQC, 1H–15N histidine selective long-range
HMQC, three-dimensional (3D) NOESY-HSQC, and 3D TOCSY-HSQC experiments
as described previously.−

Results and Discussion
Figure A presents the primary structure
of THB1, which has the features of a “group I” TrHb
(TrHb1 for short), one of three branches of the TrHb family. Of the few TrHb1s that have been studied, the
closest relatives are also shown: C. eugametos LI6374 (CtrHb, 48% identity) and the cyanobacterial globins from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (49% identity) and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (46% identity). The three-dimensional structures of
these proteins are available in the cyanomet form [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) entries 1DLY, 1S69, and 4L2M, respectively].
The Cα traces of the three structures superimpose with root-mean-square
deviations of &lt;0.8 Å over 90% of the chain. This similarity
raises the expectation that the TrHb1 fold is robust and representative
of THB1. The structure of cyanomet CtrHb with appropriate amino acid
replacements (Figure B, prepared with SWISS-MODEL) was used to guide the analysis of the rTHB1
NMR data.

(A) Sequence alignment of THB1 and related TrHb1s: CtrHb, heme
domain of C. eugametos LI637; GlbN 6803, GlbN from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803; GlbN 7002, GlbN from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. The sequence numbering is for
THB1. Helices are denoted A–H according to the secondary structure
of CtrHb (PDB entry 1DLY) and Perutz notation. Residues of interest are His77 (the proximal
histidine, His F8), Tyr29 (termed “B10” by analogy to
the three-dimensional structure of mammalian Hbs), and Lys53 (“E10”).
These positions are highlighted in bold. The N-terminal sequence is
colored red and was used to raise anti-THB1 antibodies. (B) Structural
model of THB1 prepared with SWISS-MODEL. The program selected CtrHb with bound cyanide (PDB entry 1DLY) as the best template
for homology modeling. (C) b Heme structure and numbering.

Purified rTHB1 appeared as a single band on silver-stained
SDS–polyacrylamide
gels (Figure A, lane 1). The heme-reconstituted
protein is highly soluble in aqueous buffer and has a far-UV circular
dichroism spectrum consistent with the helical content of CtrHb (Figure
S1 of the ). The
high affinity of rTHB1 for heme and its reproducible behavior in solution
suggest that this protein can serve as a good substitute for endogenous
THB1. The characterization of the purified protein was initiated with
optical spectroscopy to gain insight into heme coordination, association
with various diatomic ligands, and stability to acid.

polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against a THB1 peptide.

rTHB1 Binds Diatomic Ligands
Figure A–D shows the absorption spectra of rTHB1
with and
without the usual complement of diatomic ligands at neutral pH: O2, CO, and NO• in the ferrous state and CN– and NO• in the ferric state. Of
note is the formation of the cyanide adduct of the ferrous state (Figure C) by DT reduction of cyanomet rTHB1. Ferrous cyano
rTHB1, however, could not be obtained by addition of cyanide to reduced
rTHB1. Absorbance maxima and extinction coefficients are listed in
Table . Each spectrum is distinctive and can
be used for the purpose of identifying species occurring in mixtures
and enzymatic assays.

pH Dependence of Heme Axial
Coordination in Ferric rTHB1
Figure  and Figure S2 of the  illustrate the pH response
of rTHB1 monitored via absorbance measurements in the absence of added
ligand. Below pH 4.8, the Soret band experiences a sharp decrease
in intensity (apparent pKa of 3.72 ±
0.01 and a Hill coefficient of 3.45 ± 0.15, where the uncertainties
are the errors of the fit); a shallower drop occurs at pH &gt;10.8
(apparent
pKa of 12.49 ± 0.01 and a Hill coefficient
of 1.25 ± 0.03). Both acid and alkaline transitions (Figure S2
of the ) are accompanied
by spectral alterations between 400 and 700 nm characteristic of a
change in heme coordination. The acid transition is likely coupled
with protonation of the proximal histidine, the loss of heme from
the protein cavity, and protein unfolding, whereas the nature of the
alkaline transition is unclear as the spectral features at very high
pH (broad absorption band at 588 nm, Soret maximum at 398 nm, and
shoulder at 350 nm) do not match those of free hemin under the same
conditions.

indicate the direction of the change as the pH is decreased. (B) Absorbance

is the result of fitting the data according to a modified Henderson–Hasselbalch
equation assuming a single ionization event [pKa = 6.48 (see the text)]. (C) Absorbance of the ferrous protein
at 559 nm as a function of pH.

The spectral response in the range of pH 4.8–10.8
is shown
for the visible region in Figure A. Figure B presents the pH titration curve described by the
absorbance at 540 nm. The 430–700 nm data, when analyzed by
singular-value decomposition, yield two
principal abstract vectors. Global fitting returns an apparent pKa of 6.48 ±
0.07 with a Hill coefficient of 0.86 ± 0.03 and indicates a transition
involving one proton. However, imperfect isosbestic points (482, 522,
and 598 nm) and the sloping baselines required to achieve a good fit
(Figure B) hint at the participation of an
additional low-population species or secondary ionization event.

The main spectral component between pH 4.8 and 6.5 is consistent
with a high-spin, water-bound species. In contrast, the main component between pH 6.5 and 10.8 has low-spin
character and is not readily recognized. Its appearance eliminates
the possibility of a ferric hydroxy complex or a ferric pentacoordinate species and supports coordination of a protein residue to the iron on the
distal side. This behavior parallels that of ferric CtrHb.

pH Dependence of Heme Axial Coordination
in Ferrous rTHB1
The response of ferrous rTHB1 to pH, shown
in Figure C, is also reminiscent of that observed
for CtrHb. Between
pH 7 and 10, the protein spectrum is consistent with that of a six-coordinate
low-spin complex. At acidic pH, the spectral
features of a four-coordinate heme emerge
with broad Soret and α–β bands suggesting loose
association of the heme with the protein. The intermediate state,
presumably a five-coordinate species with the proximal histidine as
sole axial ligand, does not become highly populated under the explored
conditions, although there is evidence of this state at neutral pH
(Figure S3 of the ). The apparent pKa for the global six-coordinate
to four-coordinate transition is ∼6.6.

Optical Data for the Endogenous
Coordination on the Distal Side
Two plausible candidates
for axial coordination on the distal side
of the heme are the residues at position B10, as proposed in CtrHb, and E10, as in the two cyanobacterial GlbNs
introduced in Figure A., In THB1, Tyr29 occupies the B10 position and Lys53 the E10 position.
To determine the identity of the distal ligand, we first replaced
Tyr29 (B10) with a phenylalanine. The Y29F variant binds heme tightly
and yields optical spectra (not shown) similar to those of the wild-type
protein. In addition, the pH response has transitions in the acidic,
neutral, and alkaline regions that match closely those of the wild-type
protein (Figure S2 of the ). In particular, the transition near neutral pH occurs with an apparent
pKa of 6.82 ± 0.05 and a Hill coefficient
of 0.97 ± 0.05, obtained by global fitting. The minor perturbations
caused by the Y29F replacement suggest that, in ferric wild-type THB1,
Tyr B10 is not an axial ligand to the iron.

In contrast, the
K53A replacement causes pronounced changes in the optical spectrum
and its pH response. At neutral pH, ferric K53A rTHB1 has a spectrum
(Figure ) reminiscent of ferric wild-type
and Y29F rTHB1 at acidic pH, indicating the presence of a water molecule
on the distal side of the heme and the absence of a sixth endogenous
ligand. There is little change in the spectrum from pH 5 to 8 (Figure
S4 of the ). Starting
at pH ∼8, the Soret band, the Q-band, and charge transfer band
begin to decrease as the pH is increased. At pH 10, the charge transfer
band has almost disappeared and both the Soret band and the Q-band
shift to the red (Soret maximum of 406–408 nm; Q range of 502–534 nm) in an apparent aquomet–hydroxymet
transition. These data implicate Lys53 (E10) as the distal ligand
to the iron responsible for the six-coordinate low-spin features detected
optically in wild-type and Y29F rTHB1. The absence of a 602 nm maximum
in these spectra also suggests that Tyr B10 does not coordinate the
iron when K53 is removed. Interestingly,
the spectra of ferric and ferrous wild-type and Y29F rTHB1 resemble
those reported for the Met100Lys variant of cytochrome c550, with allowance for a
blue shift caused by the thioether cross-links in the cytochrome.
Similarity to complexes with N–Fe–N coordination is
also noted.

and in the reduced state at pH 7.1. The ferric state undergoes an

NMR Data for the Identification of Lys53 as the Distal Axial
Ligand
Optical spectra have limited information content,
and amino acid replacements can have unanticipated consequences; confirmation
of the ligation scheme was therefore pursued by NMR spectroscopy.
At pH 7.6, the 1H spectrum of ferric rTHB1, shown in Figure A, contains moderately shifted resonances supporting
a predominant low-spin complex. The spectrum also showed a minor population
of low-intensity, far-downfield broad resonances characteristic of
a high-spin (S = 5/2) complex. In accordance with the absorbance data, the
population of this high-spin form increased when the pH was decreased
(Figure B) and was therefore attributed to
an aquomet species. As the pH was increased above 8, the broad lines
disappeared, and only the spectrum with comparatively narrow features
could be detected (not shown). At pH 7.0, the Y29F variant also displays
a predominant low-spin species (Figure C).
In contrast, the K53A rTHB1 spectrum at neutral pH contains only the
resonances of an aquomet complex (Figure D).
As the pH is increased to 9.1, a broad spectrum consistent with mixtures
of aquomet and hydroxymet forms is obtained (not shown).

One-dimensional 1H spectra of ferric rTHB1: (A) wild
type at pH 7.6 (∼9% high-spin), (B) wild type at pH 5.4 (intensity
×4 compared to trace A, ∼90% high-spin), (C) Y29F variant
at pH 7.0 (intensity of downfield region ×3, ∼40% high-spin),
and (D) K53A variant at pH 7.4. Resonances marked a–d correspond
to the 3-CH3, 8-CH3, and 2-vinyl βtrans and βcis protons, respectively, from the low-spin wild-type and Y29F
species. Data were recorded in a 10% 2H2O/90% 1H2O mixture at 298 K.

Analysis of 1H–13C HMQC and
DQF-COSY
data identified the ring signals from Tyr29 and Phe29 in wild-type
and Y29F rTHB1, respectively (Figure S5 of the ). The moderate line widths and modest
downfield shifts of Tyr29 ring protons are inconsistent with ligation
to the heme iron. In neither case were any NOE contacts observed between
the aromatic ring at position 29 and the heme cofactor. Signals from
a potential sixth ligand were not immediately apparent in these spectra.

In the proximity of the iron, paramagnetic effects can broaden
lines and render resonance identification difficult. These effects
were attenuated by reduction to the ferrous state, which was conducted
at high pH (9–9.5) to populate fully the diamagnetic complex
according to the optical data. The water presaturation 1H 1D spectrum of ferrous wild-type rTHB1 (Figure A) and ferrous Y29F rTHB1 (Figure B) at pH 9.5 (10% 2H2O/90% 1H2O) and pH* 9.2 (90% 2H2O/90% 1H2O), respectively, revealed a set of six single-proton
resonances between −1.4 and −3.4 ppm. Such large upfield
shifts are expected of nuclei directly above and below the porphyrin
macrocycle. These signals are absent from the spectra of the K53A
variant (Figure S6C of the ). In agreement with expectations, of the reduced proteins only K53A
rTHB1 shows broad features typical of S &gt; 1/2 states (Figure S6C–E of the ).

Y29F rTHB1 in a 10% 1H2O/90% 2H2O mixture (pH* 9.2). Heme meso, Asn87 NH, and resolved Lys53
signals are labeled.

J correlation data [DQF-COSY (Figure A)] collected on Y29F rTHB1 unequivocally connect
the upfield-shifted signals and trace a -CH-(CH2)4- system attributed to a lysine. NOE data (Figure B–D) confirmed dipolar contact with three of the four
heme meso protons. Assignments are provided in Table S2 of the . A strikingly similar
set of aliphatic resonances has been reported for the Met100Lys variant
of cytochrome c() and
lends further support to the ligation of a lysine to the iron. In
addition, a resonance corresponding to two labile protons was detected
at −7.8 ppm. Strong NOEs to the lysine aliphatic chain (Figure B) and to the heme α meso proton (not shown)
and splitting into a doublet in 15N-labeled samples (Figure A) secure assignment to the NζH2 of the lysine. The chemical shifts of the Lys53 side chain are listed
in Table S3 of the . We conclude that the distal ligand in ferrous rTHB1 is Lys53. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented example of
a His–Fe–Lys coordination scheme in a hemoglobin.

Lys53 signals. Black symbols in panel D denote heme meso signals.

The pH titrations of ferric and
ferrous wild-type rTHB1 (Figure ) suggest
that K53 is a heme ligand in the ferric
state. To test this hypothesis, we sought to measure ESE in wild-type
rTHB1. A sample of uniformly 15N-labeled ferric wild-type
rTHB1 was prepared at pH 9.2 to favor the endogenous hexacoordinate
state (Figure ). Substoichiometric addition
of DT resulted in a mixture of ferrous and ferric rTHB1. In fully
relaxed 1H–15N HSQC spectra, the downfield-shifted
amide NH signals from Asn87 (see below) report on the proportion of
reduced and oxidized species. The mixture shown in Figure  originally contained approximately 31% reduced
rTHB1. Little oxidation occurred during the course of data acquisition
(28% reduced rTHB1 present at the end). Two-dimensional 1H–(NZ)–1H data were collected
to take advantage of the resolved 1H shifts and the apparent
slow exchange between the two states. The observation of specific
cross peaks connecting corresponding ferrous and ferric amide NH resonances
is direct evidence that under these conditions, an electron transfer
event interconverts the redox forms of rTHB1.

peaks are from Asn87 NH. (B) Matching region of a 1H–(15NZ)–1H ZZ exchange NMR spectrum
(τmix = 701 ms) recorded on the ferrous/ferric mixture.
The square pattern is caused by redox interconversion.

In favorable cases, measurement of the cross and
diagonal peak
intensities as a function of the NZ mixing time provides
data for determining the rate constant of exchange. The population drift and low signal-to-noise ratio prevented
a detailed analysis of the exchange process, but an estimate could
be obtained from the backbone amide cross peak of Asn87. An effective
ESE rate constant was found to be 0.4 s–1 at 1.8
mM total protein (apparent second-order rate constant of ∼0.2
mM–1 s–1). Although this number
pertains to nonphysiological conditions, it indicates that rTHB1 can
exchange electrons at a rate ∼1 order of magnitude slower than
that of the bis-histidine GlbNs under similar conditions. ESE kinetics have been measured from 107 to 102 M–1 s–1 in a variety of heme proteins, including cytochromes c (His-Met, 107–102 M–1 s–1), cytochromes b5 (His-His, 105–104 M–1 s–1), and aforementioned GlbNs (His-His, 103–102 M–1 s–1). The rather slow kinetics for rTHB1
suggest that structural reorganization may limit the rate of electron
transfer. Rapid lysine decoordination or solvent exchange dynamics
may explain the slow but detectable ESE and be responsible for the
broad line shape of the Lys53 NζH2. Overall, the
data are consistent with Lys53 being the reversible distal ligand
in both the ferric and ferrous states of rTHB1.

Cyanomet rTHB1
Has a Distal H-Bond Network
Upon addition
of cyanide, the 1H NMR resonances of rTHB1 sharpen significantly
(Figure A). This complex is stable and was
chosen for the study of a representative species with a bound exogenous
ligand. The number and intensity of hyperfine-shifted resonances indicate
that two forms of the protein coexist in a 5.5:1 ratio. Heme signals
from both forms are readily assigned with homonuclear NOESY, DQF-COSY,
and TOCSY data, aided by natural abundance 1H–13C HMQC spectra. Resonance attribution is performed on the
basis of 13C shift, 1H intensity, and 1H–1H scalar coupling patterns (Figure S7 of the  contains the vinyl couplings).
Assignment to specific peripheral substituents (Figure C) is achieved using intra-heme NOE connectivities. For example,
the 1-CH3/2-vinyl and 3-CH3/4-vinyl pairs are
distinguished by the observation of a small 8-CH3-to-1-CH3 effect. Figure S8 of the  shows the heme group with relevant intra-heme NOEs. Table  lists the chemical shifts of the heme peripheral
substituents. The heme methyl chemical shift pattern displayed by
the minor form is consistent with heme orientational isomerism, as are NOEs (not shown).

The conformation
of the distal pocket, where exogenous ligands
bind and chemistry usually occurs, is an important determinant of
reactivity. In cyanomet rTHB1, two exchangeable protons, not split
into a doublet when the protein is uniformly labeled with 15N, are detected at 27.0 ppm (major isomer) and 24.8 ppm (minor isomer)
(Figure A). These efficiently relaxed protons
have strong NOEs to resonances at 10.2 ppm (major isomer) and 9.68
ppm (minor isomer), themselves J-coupled to signals
at 8.12 and 7.90 ppm, respectively. 13C data (Figure S9
of the ) prescribe
assignment to Hδ and Hε resonances of two (major and minor)
tyrosine rings rotating rapidly about their Cγ–Cζ
axis. Similar sets of OηH and ring signals are detected in other
cyanomet TrHb1 spectra, and are characteristic of Tyr
B10 as it forms a hydrogen bond to the axial cyanide. In rTHB1, this
residue is Tyr29, as confirmed with partial sequential assignments
secured with 15N-separated NOESY and TOCSY data. Ring-to-ring
NOEs to the adjacent Phe28 indicate a geometry compatible with that
of CtrHb (PDB entry 1DLY). Consistent with this, the spectrum of cyanomet Y29F rTHB1 (Figure B) does not contain any labile proton resonances
downfield of 16 ppm, whereas the cyanomet K53A rTHB1 variant displays
a 1H NMR spectrum (Figure C) similar
to that of the wild-type protein and contains the characteristic Y29
OηH signal. The direct involvement of the distal lysine in stabilizing
exogenous cyanide therefore seems unlikely.

The 1H–15N HSQC data of wild-type
rTHB1 reveal two NH2 groups belonging to the major isomer
and having 1H signals at 11.11 and 5.27 ppm (15N at 96.3 ppm) and 8.63 and −0.90 ppm (15N at 103.3
ppm). The first of these NH2 groups has NOEs to the rings
of Phe28 and Tyr29 and is assigned to Gln54 (E11). The other is assigned
to Gln50 (E7). A model of the distal hydrogen bond network to cyanide
is illustrated in Figure S10A of the .

The sequence alignment of Figure A and
analogy to the determined structures of cyanide-bound GlbN (PDB entry 4L2M) and CtrHb (PDB
entry 1DLY)
suggest that several residues should be in close contact with the
heme group. Thus, an upfield-shifted valine with NOEs to the 3-CH3, 4-vinyl Hβcis, and ring protons of Phe28
is assigned to Val94, in the G helix. Near the 1-CH3 group,
the signals of a Leu and a Phe ring belong to Leu73 and Phe57, respectively.
In contact with the 2-vinyl, Phe, Val, and Ala side chains are detected
and identified as Phe91, Phe28, Val94, Val119, and Ala122. Tyr68,
along with Phe57 and Leu73, is in contact with the 8-CH3 group, whereas the 5-CH3 group has NOEs to Phe41 and
Phe42. A representative set of NOEs is shown in Figure S11 of the . All assignments are consistent
with the observed scalar connectivities and 1H–15N-based sequential assignments. A model of the proximal side
of the heme is illustrated in Figure S10B of the .

An additional conserved feature
of TrHb1s is the formation of a
side chain–main chain hydrogen bond between a histidine at
the beginning of the G helix (Nδ acceptor) and an amide in the
turn preceding it (NH donor). In rTHB1, this helix capping interaction
involves Asn87 NH and His90 Nδ1 and is in large part responsible
for the downfield shift of Asn87 NH (major 1H signal at
11.22 ppm; minor signal at 11.33 ppm). In the absence of an exogenous
ligand, these resonances remain downfield-shifted and are useful markers
of the redox state of the protein as mentioned above. Protein chemical
shifts are listed in Table S4 of the .

Overall, the spectroscopic results confirm
that cyanomet rTHB1
resembles in fold and heme pocket geometry the related Synechocystis GlbN (PDB entry 1S69), Synechococcus GlbN (PDB entry 4L2M), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis TrHbN (PDB entry 1RTE), Tetrahymena pyriformis trHb (PDB entry 3AQ5), and C. eugametos CtrHb (PDB entry 1DLY). The distal hydrogen
bond network that stabilizes exogenous ligands is present. Despite
the conserved fold and the conserved Tyr B10, however, the proteins
are significantly different in the absence of an exogenous ligand.
At neutral pH, bis-histidine coordination of the heme iron through
His F8 (proximal) and His E10 is observed in ferric and ferrous GlbNs.,,M. tuberculosis TrHbN and T. pyriformis trHb bind water in the
ferric state (aquomet form) and become five-coordinate species upon
being reduced to the ferrous state., In C. eugametos CtrHb, Tyr B10 was proposed to be the sixth
ligand to the iron, and in C.
reinhardtii THB1, the distal ligand is Lys E10. These different
coordination modes are expected to condition heme reactivity.

The structure of THB1 in the absence of exogenous ligand remains
to be fully elucidated. The resemblance to the bis-histidine GlbNs
of Figure A is expected because of the common
E10 ligation. In GlbNs, Tyr B10 is not in the heme pocket, which would
explain the small effect of the Y29F replacement on the acid–base
transition observed at pH 6.5 in rTHB1 (Figure S2 of the ). This transition, attributed
to the ionization equilibrium of Lys53, occurs ∼3.5 pH units
lower than for a solvent-exposed lysine and indicates a free energy
expenditure on the order of 20 kJ/mol, similar to the cost of ligating
the proximal histidine at pH 3 but to
be compensated for at neutral pH.

rTHB1 Is Capable of Efficient
NOD Activity
NOD activity
is a common function of globins that is often imputed to TrHbs. For
example, M. tuberculosis TrHbN and T. pyriformis TrHb1 are both likely to serve in the capacity of NO• detoxifiers. Although there are differences in the heme pockets
of these proteins, they share the distal hydrogen bond network identified
by NMR spectroscopy in cyanomet rTHB1. This network may enhance the
superoxide character of the O2-bound state and facilitate
the NOD reaction. In the case of C. reinhardtii,
NOD activity may be useful for protection from nitrosative damage
and for the regulation of processes involving NO•.

To investigate the ability of rTHB1 to undergo multiple NOD
turnovers, a simple in vitro assay was designed that
utilizes the optical spectra shown in Figure  (see ). Figure A illustrates typical results. At time zero, a
molar equivalent of MAHMA-NONOate was added to a sample containing
rTHB1-O2 and the Fd/NADP+ reduction system.
An immediate decrease in absorbance at 581 and 545 nm registers the
disappearance of rTHB1-O2. At the end of this rapid phase,
the spectrum corresponds to a mixture of ferric rTHB1 and rTHB1-O2 (66 and 34%, respectively, in this particular experiment).
The protein then returns to 100% rTHB1-O2 under the effect
of the enzymatic reduction system and dissolved O2. Under
these conditions, conversion is observed from the ferric state directly
to the oxy state without detection of a ferrous intermediate.

in absorbance in the visible region. Samples contained ∼10
μM protein in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) and a Fd/NADP+ reduction system. (A) Time traces at 545 nm (top line, blue)
and 581 nm (bottom line, green) upon repeated addition of 1 equiv
of MAHMA-NONOate to wild-type rTHB1-O2. The first addition
occurred at time zero; subsequent additions are marked by vertical
arrows. (B) Same as panel A, using 1.5 equiv of MAHMA-NONOate. The
additional minor phase during the “turnover” period
corresponds to buildup and decay of the ferric–nitrosyl adduct.
(C) Time trace at 545 nm (blue) and 633 nm (green) upon repeated addition
of 1 equiv of MAHMA-NONOate to K53A rTHB1-O2. (D) Time
trace at 545 nm (blue) and 581 nm (green) upon repeated addition of
1 equiv of MAHMA-NONOate to Y29F rTHB1-O2.

Subsequent additions of MAHMA-NONOate lead to the
same sawtooth
behavior. The proportion of ferric state at the minimum of absorbance
varies, with a tendency for an increase over the course of multiple
NO• injections. At concentrations of the NO• donor capable of releasing 3 rather than 2 times the
amount of protein, the ferric form binds NO•, giving
rise to the altered profile shown in Figure B. At no point was the ferrous–nitrosyl adduct of rTHB1 detected.
The same experiment conducted with horse skeletal muscle Mb gave the
profile shown in Figure S12 of the .

To verify that rTHB1 turns over NO• and forms
nitrate, the end mixtures were subjected to the Griess assay. The Griess assay depends on the reaction of
sulfanilic acid with nitrite to form an activated diazonium salt,
ultimately producing the detected azo dye. Under conditions of excess
Griess reagents, colorimetric product formation reports on nitrite
concentration. In the absence of rTHB1, oxidation of NO• by O2 generates detectable quantities of nitrite most
likely through the NO• + 1/2O2 reaction. In the presence
of rTHB1, however, a negligible amount of nitrite is found in solution
(Figure S13 of the ). This indicates that an enzymatic reaction consumes NO• considerably faster than the enzyme-free processes. Addition of A. niger NR to convert nitrate to nitrite showed that in
the rTHB1 sample, ∼90% of NO• released by
MAHMA-NONOate was oxidized to nitrate. A comparable yield was obtained
with Mb.

The minimal set of reactions in the NOD assay includes
(1) release
of NO• by MAHMA-NONOate (first-order decay, measured
independently), (2) reaction of NO• with rTHB1-O2 (eqs  and ,
considered irreversible), (3) reduction of ferric rTHB1 via reduced
Fd, (4) Fd re-reduction, and (5) O2 binding by ferrous
rTHB1 (reversible, measured independently in the absence of NO•). Although accurate rate constants for NOD activity
cannot be obtained with this assay, it is possible to test the plausibility
of the mechanism by simulating the kinetic traces corresponding to
each NO• addition. Reproduction of the experimental
data shown in Figure A can be achieved with
a first phase dominated by the release of NO• by
MAHMA-NONOate and a second phase limited by the rate of reduction
of Fd by the NADPH system. At higher NO• concentrations
(Figure B), reversible binding of NO• to ferric rTHB1 must also be included to account for
the additional spectral feature.

The simplest interpretation
of the data is that rTHB1 can process
NO• efficiently in the test tube and that it undergoes
no or little damage as it turns over the substrates. This supports
the possibility that if O2 and NO• are
simultaneously available to THB1 in the cell, NOD activity is likely.
Multiple turnovers, however, require a reducing agent. Reductants
such as NADPH and glutathione are not effective with the recombinant
protein when used in reasonable concentrations (data not shown). The
identity of the reducing agent in the cell, dedicated to THB1 or not,
is not known.

The NOD assay was repeated with Y29F and K53A
rTHB1. Qualitatively,
the sawtooth pattern shown in Figure A is
observed with both proteins (Figure C,D),
and nitrate yields are comparable to those obtained with wild-type
rTHB1 (Figure S13 of the ). However, two differences are noted with the variants. First, the
intensity of the Y29F rTHB1 spectrum decreases steadily throughout
the experiment. We hypothesize as proposed by others that Tyr B10 stabilizes bound dioxygen and that its replacement
with a phenylalanine exacerbates competing processes such as autoxidation
(i.e., superoxide release), ultimately leading to heme damage. Second,
the proportion of ferric protein reached after addition of MAHMA-NONOate
to K53A rTHB1-O2 is higher than for the wild-type protein
and Y29F variant, and the recovery to the oxy state is slower than
for those two proteins. These observations are consistent with a coordinated
Lys E10 facilitating electron transfer from the reducing system. We
also expect Lys E10, once displaced from its axial position, to engage
in a salt bridge with a heme propionate and modulate iron accessibility.

the structural and chemical data, we pursued the in vivo characterization of THB1. To this end, we generated an anti-THB1
polyclonal antiserum. In a previous study, presence of THB1 was confirmed by the identification through mass
spectrometry of two proteolytic fragments from the flagella of the C. reinhardtii bbs4-1 mutant. One of the peptides corresponds
to an N-terminal extension to the truncated globin domain and most
of the short α helix. The N-terminal extension is only a few
residues long (Figure A), and analysis of
the THB1 sequence with PredAlgo, a program
designed to reveal protein subcellular localization in green algae,
does not suggest targeting to a specific organelle of the cell. On
the basis of evidence that the N-terminal extension is expressed and
unlikely to be important for protein targeting, this region of the
protein was chosen for anti-THB1 antibody production.

Polyclonal
antibodies raised against the N-terminal proteolytic fragment (red
sequence in Figure A) recognize rTHB1 (Figure B, lane 1) and a protein within whole cell extracts
of C. reinhardtii at the molecular weight that corresponds
to full-length THB1 (Figure B, lane 2). The
purified polyclonal antibodies appear to be highly specific; the only
other detected band gives a weak response at a molecular weight slightly
below 40000, seen only after prolonged overexposure (data not shown).

Given the assumption that THB1 interacts in some form with NO•, the native function of THB1 may well be linked to
cellular activity that either creates NO• or is
regulated by the molecule. Nitrogen metabolism is a potential target
for THB1 as it is both regulated by NO• and can produce NO• through
a low-efficiency side reaction of NR acting on nitrite. Nitrogen usage in C. reinhardtii is complicated by the fact that not all laboratory strains metabolize
nitrogen in the same way. Both CC-1690 and CC-125 are commonly used
laboratory strains of C. reinhardtii; CC-1690 is
assumed to be genetically identical to the original Sager 21 gr laboratory
strain, but CC-125 carries mutations within both the NIT1 and NIT2 genes. The NIT1 gene encodes the only NR found within C. reinhardtii; it is responsible for reducing nitrate
to nitrite via an NADPH-dependent reaction. NIT2 encodes
a transcription factor required for expression of genes involved in
nitrogen assimilation and is activated by nitrate. A cell with nonfunctional copies of either NIT1 or NIT2 is thus prevented from utilizing nitrate
as a source for nitrogen. Figure A shows
immunodetection of THB1 in protein extracts from whole cells grown
in Sager-Granick M medium. THB1 is found in strain CC-1690 but is
not detected in strain CC-125. The NIT1 and NIT2 mutations in the CC-125 strain can be separated using
strains CC-1086 (containing only a mutation to the NIT2 gene) and CC-2453 (containing only a mutation to the NIT1 gene). As seen in Figure A, only strains
with functional versions of the NIT2 gene express
detectable levels of THB1 within the cell.

control. (B) Western blot of whole cell extracts probed with antibodies

(C) Transcript abundances of THB1 relative to CBLP, as determined by qPCR. Averages ± the standard
deviation of three independent experiments performed on a mixture
of biological duplicates are shown (nd, not detected). All samples
were grown in Sager-Granick M medium except “NH4+” and “NO3–”, which are strain CC-1690 grown in ammonium and nitrate,
respectively, as in panel B.

When nitrate is present in the growth medium, NIT2 induces expression of the nitrate assimilation pathway. Sager-Granick
M medium uses 3.75 mM ammonium nitrate as the nitrogen source (i.e.,
equal amounts of ammonium and nitrate). When the M medium is modified
to contain 7.5 mM ammonium chloride or 7.5 mM potassium nitrate, the
amount of THB1 within C. reinhardtii strain CC-1690
varies (Figure B). When nitrate is absent
from the medium, there is a marked depletion of THB1 protein from
the cell. When cells are grown in original M medium and then placed
in medium with only ammonium as a nitrogen source, the level of THB1
gradually decreases over the course of 48 h (Figure S14A of the ). Conversely, when cells
are grown in the presence of ammonium as the sole nitrogen source
and then switched into the original M medium, detectable levels of
THB1 appear within 6 h (Figure S14B of the ).

The transcriptional regulation of the THB1 gene
was followed using RNA isolated from these individual strains (Figure C). The level of gene expression for the THB1 gene was undetectable when either strain CC-125 or
CC-1086 was analyzed; however, both CC-1690 and CC-2453 (containing
functional NIT2 genes) possessed equivalent levels
of the transcript. The CC-1690 strain reduced its level of THB1 transcripts when grown in a nitrate-free (7.5 mM ammonium)
medium, in agreement with the depletion of the protein seen in the
immunoblot (Figure A,B). In summary, these
observations are consistent with induced expression of THB1 being dependent on the presence of nitrate.

The Presence of THB1 in
Flagella Is Not Related to Flagellar
BBS4 Levels
A previous study reported that THB1 and three
other proteins, all identified by mass spectrometric analysis of bands
excised from an SDS–polyacrylamide gel, were greatly enriched
in flagella of the nonphototactic mutant bbs4-1 compared
to its parent strain g1, which shows strong negative phototaxis. The bbs4-1 mutant was generated
from strain g1 (nit1, NIT2) by insertional
mutagenesis with a DNA fragment containing NIT1 as
the selectable marker; the mutant is
null for BBS4, which encodes a critical component
of the BBSome, a multiprotein flagellar IFT cargo adapter. The apparent accumulation of THB1 and the other
proteins in the flagella of bbs4-1 relative to the
flagella of g1 raised the possibility that one or more of these proteins
might be interfering with phototaxis. These results also led to the
suggestion that these proteins are continuously cycling through the
flagella and that their export from the flagella is dependent on the
BBSome.

The availability of an antibody to THB1 and the finding
that THB1 expression could be regulated by the presence
or absence of nitrate in the medium allowed us to reexamine the possibilities
of a phototactic effect and a relation to the BBSome for THB1. To
determine whether THB1 levels in the flagella are dependent on BBS4,
we probed Western blots of isolated flagella from bbs4-1 and g1 with anti-THB1. As previously reported, THB1 was detected in the flagella of bbs4-1 but not g1 cells (Figure S15A of the ). Surprisingly, THB1 was also either not present
or present at exceedingly low levels in g1 whole cells or cell bodies
lacking flagella. THB1 transcripts also were not detected in g1, similar
to strains carrying nit2 mutations (Figure S15B of
the ). Although g1
was originally wild type for NIT2, our
current g1 strain failed to grow with either nitrate or nitrite as
the sole nitrogen source; in contrast, bbs4-1 was
NIT2, as expected (Figure S15C of the ). This suggests that the g1 strain maintained in
the Witman lab and used in this study and that of Lechtreck et al. is a nit1 nit2 double mutant,
most likely as a result of acquiring a spontaneous mutation in the NIT2 gene some time during the dozen or so years between
generation of the bbs4-1 strain and the comparative
analysis of the two strains by Lechtreck et al. The results indicate that the differences in THB1 levels
in flagella of g1 versus bbs4-1 seen previously and
again here simply reflect differences in THB1 expression. Importantly,
flagella isolated from normally phototactic CC-1690 cells expressing
both BBS4 and THB1 had levels of THB1 indistinguishable from that
of bbs4-1 flagella (Figure ). Therefore, a lack of BBS4 does not lead to an accumulation of
THB1 in flagella, and the presence of THB1 in flagella is unlikely
to explain the phototaxis defect in bbs4-1 cells.

Test
of the dependence of THB1 on BBS4 for flagellar export. Western
blots of whole cells (WC), deflagellated cell bodies (CB), and isolated
flagella from CC-1690 and bbs4-1 were probed with
the indicated antibodies (IB). Equivalent amounts of cells and cell
bodies and a 10-, 100-, or 1000-fold excess of flagella were loaded
(1× is 105 whole cells or cell bodies, 10× flagella
is 2 × 106 flagella, etc.). The axonemal protein IC2
and the IFT protein IFT139 were used as loading controls. The β
subunit of the ATP synthase was used to assess the possible level
of cell body contamination of the isolated flagella. Flagellar levels
of THB1, which are too high to be ascribed to cell body contamination,
are equivalent in the presence (CC-1690) and absence (bbs4-1) of BBS4.

Of the four proteins
identified as being abnormally present in
fractions of bbs4-1 versus g1 flagella, only THB1 was present in the aqueous phase enriched
for flagellar matrix proteins; the rest, including phospholipase D
(PLD), were present in the detergent phase enriched for membrane proteins.
PLD has subsequently been shown to undergo a massive redistribution
from the cell body to the flagella in the absence of BBS4; this redistribution
is rapidly reversed when BBS4 is reintroduced into the flagella by
fusing bbs4-1 cells with wild-type cells. The results of Figure  confirm that PLD accumulates in flagella of bbs4-1 cells but not in flagella of wild-type cells, in this case strain
CC-1690. Therefore, PLD does cycle through the flagella, and export
of PLD from the flagella is dependent on the BBSome. Such BBSome-mediated
export may be a feature of many membrane-associated proteins that
undergo such cycling. In contrast, because
THB1 is a small soluble protein, it may diffuse freely through the
barrier that separates the flagellar and cytosolic compartments; recent
studies indicate that this barrier is permeable to soluble proteins
of less than ∼50 kDa., Moreover, the fact
that THB1 can enter the flagella strongly suggests that it is present
in the cell cytoplasm and not strictly localized to a particular cell
organelle. It may or may not have a specific function inside the flagellum.

Possible THB1 Function
Our results strongly suggest
that the expression of the THB1 gene is not constitutive
but rather linked to the source of nitrogen available to the cell.
This expression pattern also resembles that of NR, which is known
to be under the control of the NIT2 gene product. A minimal interpretation of the data holds that
THB1 and NR expressions are linked because THB1 is required to eliminate
the NO• released by NR. In addition to recycling
the nitrogen to nitrate and lowering NO• levels
temporarily, THB1 could also temper S-nitrosylation and other RNS
reactions. A similar mitigation role has been proposed for GlbN in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Like THB1, Synechococcus GlbN occurs at low levels
in the cytoplasm, although unlike THB1, it is constitutively expressed.
Challenging the Synechococcus cells with NO• or a high concentration of nitrate reveals that GlbN protects against
ROS and RNS.

With its structural plasticity, its ability to
bind ligands, and its NOD activity, THB1 may participate in downstream
regulatory processes. Recent studies have indeed found multiple NO-regulated
pathways within C. reinhardtii, including copper
stress response, hypoxia, and ammonium and nitrate transport., NO• regulation would not, however, be limited
to THB1 because physiologic conditions exist under which exogenous
NO• is present while synthesis of THB1 is dramatically
curtailed. Another agent, possibly one of the other many putative
hemoglobins, would be needed to manage the NO• load.
In fact, potentially overlapping roles of all hemoglobins will complicate
the identification of an unambiguous THB1 phenotype in future experiments
with knock-down strains. The interrelation of NO•, RNS, and ROS chemistries in and out of the cell also presents special
difficulties for the interpretation of results obtained under various
challenges to cell growth.

Conclusion
We have shown that in
THB1 the heme iron
has two axial ligands: the proximal histidine in the F helix and a
displaceable distal lysine (neutral Lys53) in the E helix. The structure
of the His–Fe–Lys protein is expected to resemble that
of GlbN in the bis-histidine state. The His–Fe–Lys scheme,
like the His–Fe–His scheme, provides a means of enhancing
electron transfer kinetics, affecting ligand association and dissociation
rates, and influencing the reduction potential relative to a pentacoordinate
counterpart. These effects can be harnessed to control NOD activity
and other enzymatic reactions with requirements of redox cycling and
substrate access and egress. In vitro, rTHB1 is an
efficient NO• dioxygenase, and the link to nitrogen
metabolism, specifically expression of NR, suggests that a similar
activity occurs in the cell. Further investigation will establish
the distinct advantages and disadvantages of the His–Fe–Lys
scheme under various cellular conditions of ROS load, RNS load, and
pH.

Hemoglobins first appeared more than 3 billion years ago
in a biosphere substantially different from ours. Without significant
atmospheric oxygen and with a host of highly reduced molecules, stringent
control of redox chemistry must have been essential to the earliest
forms of life. Hbs have been retained since those early days and have
remained within the genetic toolbox of organisms across the entire
spectrum of life. Many of these Hbs have been proposed to function
in roles related to reactive nitrogen usage.,,C. reinhardtii is a well-studied
model organism,− and exploring the function of TrHbs within this alga
will harness a wealth of knowledge for defining the role of these
proteins. The study of THB1 presented here constitutes a first step
toward a comprehensive investigation of photosynthetic microbial Hbs.
