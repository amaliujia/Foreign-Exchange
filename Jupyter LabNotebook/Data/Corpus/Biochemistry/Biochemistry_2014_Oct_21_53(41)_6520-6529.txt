Apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease
I (APE1) is an essential base excision repair enzyme that catalyzes
a Mg2+-dependent reaction resulting in the cleavage of
the phosphodiester backbone 5′ of an abasic site within double-stranded
DNA., Pre-steady-state turnover rates for APE1’s
endonuclease activity have been estimated to be greater than 700 or 850 s–1, whereas steady-state turnover rates are approximately 2
s–1. Thus, substrate
turnover is diffusion-limited, and the slow step of the reaction occurs
after the chemistry. In fact, product
release has been proposed to be the slow step of the reaction. The endonuclease reaction involves a one-step
associative phosphoryl transfer mechanism, with water serving as the
nucleophile and preference for the Rp stereoisomer during cleavage. However, the number of metal ions involved and their coordination
in the enzyme remains controversial. A two metal ion mechanism was
first proposed by Steitz and co-workers for Klenow fragment,, related polymerases, and associated exonucleases. Since then, there has been a general assumption that most
enzymes that cleave DNA, including APE1, will in fact use two metal
ions. APE1 is most closely related in
structure to Escherichia coli exonuclease
III, which binds a single metal ion in the active site. The two metal ion assumption was challenged
by Tainer and co-workers, who put forth a mechanism for APE1 involving
only one metal ion based on structural and enzymatic characterizations
of an APE1–DNA complex. In that
work, they reported a 3.0 Å structure with one Mn2+ ion bound to E96 in the active site with cleaved DNA.

Crystal
structures of APE1 with Pb2+ bound in the active
site of the enzyme were then reported, and a two metal ion mechanism
was proposed. In this mechanism, coordinating
residues for the metal ions included D70 and E96 for one metal and
H309, D210, and N212 for a second metal ion, despite the fact that
Mg2+ strongly prefers coordinating oxygen ligands. The two metal ion binding sites then formed
the basis of a proposed moving metal ion mechanism involving Mg2+ binding first to a site coordinated by D210 and N212 and
then moving 5 Å to a site coordinated by D70, E96, and D308., Finally, a 25Mg solid-state NMR study reported that APE1
binds one mole equivalent of Mg2+, which is disordered
due to its coordinating ligands, suggesting plasticity in the active
site.

Recently, a 2.4 Å resolution
structure of an APE1–Mg2+–product complex
was reported in which Mg2+ is coordinated solely to E96, as was
shown previously for the Mn2+ complex. Although the effect
of substituting E96 on the catalytic activity was characterized in
this recent study, there is currently
no solution data for direct metal binding by APE1. In the absence
of substrate, Mg2+ is coordinated by D70 and E96 in crystal
structures reported to date at moderate resolution.

In this study, we present the highest resolution
structure of APE1
as a complex with bound Mg2+ determined at 1.4 Å,
the structure of APE1 bound to Mn2+, and the first apo-APE1
structure (i.e., without bound metal). Our motivation for this study
was to establish a structural basis for metal binding in the absence
of substrate and to determine the contributions of specific residues
on metal binding and catalysis by APE1. Our results provide new insights
on the initial capture of metal ion by APE1 involving remarkable plasticity
of a metal-coordinating ligand within the active site.

Materials and
Methods
Preparation of Human APE1 Proteins
For crystallization,
a single amino acid substitution (C138A) was introduced within the
N-terminally truncated protein lacking the first 40 amino acids (Δ40APE1).
DNA encoding residues 40–318 of APE1 was inserted within the
PET-28a vector by using the NheI and XhoI restriction sites. Site-directed
mutagenesis was then used to introduce a C138A mutation, which was
confirmed by DNA sequencing. This protein was expressed as an N-terminal
hexa-His tagged protein and purified as previously described for the
C65A and wild-type Δ40APE1 proteins. In brief, the cells were lysed by using a French press, and the
crude extract was subjected to purification by Ni-NTA and SP-Sepharose
ion-exchange chromatography. The affinity tag was then removed by
treatment with thrombin, and the protein was further purified by SP-Sepharose
ion-exchange chromatography.

For differential scanning fluorimetry
assays, full-length human wild-type D70A, E96A, D70A/E96A, D210A,
and D308A APE1 proteins were expressed as N-terminal-hexa His-SUMO
fusions and prepared as previously described. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce codon changes for
D70A, E96A, D210A, and D308A using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene,
Inc. Primers for D70A are 5′-gctcttggaatgtggctgggcttcgagcctg-3′
and 5′-caggctcgaagcccagccacattccaagagc-3′;
for E96A, 5′-gttctctgaacatttggtcgcttgaaggcacagtatatc-3′
and 5′-gatatactgtgccttcaagcgaccaaatgttcagagaac-3′,
for D210A, 5′-atgtgccacattgagggctccacacagcacaag-3′
and 5′-cttgtgctgtgtggagccctcaatgtggcacat-3′;
and for D308A, 5′-tgataggacagtgagcactgccgagggcc-3′
and 5′-ggccctcggcagtgctcactgtcctatca-3′.
In brief, the fusion proteins were first adhered to Ni-NTA affinity
resin (Qiagen, Inc.). On-column cleavage with the SUMO-specific protease
Ulp1 was used to cleave full-length APE1 encoding one extra N-terminal
residue, Ser, followed by the native sequence. APE1 was eluted from
Ni-NTA agarose resin (Qiagen, Inc.) and then applied to a tandem Q-Sepharose
and SP-Sepharose. After loading the sample, the Q-Sepharose column,
which binds any contaminating SUMO protein, was removed, and a linear
NaCl gradient (10 column volumes from 50 mM to 1 M) was then applied
to the SP-Sepharose column. Fractions containing APE1 protein were
pooled and concentrated.

Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystals were obtained
by mixing equal parts (1 μL each) of microseeds with a precipitant
solution containing 100 mM MES, pH 6.0, 200 mM NaCl, 18–21%
PEG 4000, and C138A Δ40 hAPE1 (10 mg/mL) buffered in 10 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5. The protein was diluted from a stock (120 mg/mL) stored in
50 mM MES, pH 6.0, 1 mM DTT, and 300 mM NaCl. Self-nucleated crystals
of APE1 were obtained under similar conditions and used to produce
microseeds.

Metal Complexes
Complexes with either MgCl2 or MnCl2 were obtained by cocrystallization under conditions
similar to those described above with the exception that 1 mM MgCl2 or 5 mM MnCl2 was added directly to the protein
prior to crystallization. Crystals were cryocooled in 100 mM MES,
pH 6.0, 200 mM NaCl, 22% PEG 4000, 20–22% ethylene glycol,
and either 1 mM MgCl2 or 5 mM MnCl2.

Data
Collection
Data for the Mg2+ complex
with C138A Δ40 APE1 were collected at beamline GM/CA 23ID-D
at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, and processed
with HKL2000. For the APE1–Mn2+ complex, anomalous data were collected on a Bruker X8 Prospector
(Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA) with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418
Å) at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystem. Data were integrated
using SAINT and scaled with SADABS. XPREP was used
to determine the space group and to analyze the data. The apo-APE1
data were also collected on our home source instrument and processed
as described for the MnCl2 complex. All of the crystals
belong to space group P21212, with cell dimensions as shown in Table .

Structure Determination and Refinement
The apo and
metal complex structures were phased by molecular replacement (MOLREP) using the coordinates of a previously refined
structure of C138A Δ40 hAPE1 as the search model. Several rounds
of initial refinement were carried out using REFMAC5, accompanied by iterative model building using COOT. Following placement of well-ordered water molecules,
excluding those in the repair active site of the enzyme, bound metal
was identified in difference Fourier maps. The position of Mn2+ was determined by anomalous difference Fourier analysis
using the phases from the starting molecular replacement model prior
to addition of Mn2+. The Mn2+ ion was identified
as the highest peak (14.0σ) in the anomalous difference Fourier
map as compared to the next highest peak at 5.4σ. For the Mg2+ structure, a single Mg2+ ion was placed in the
highest positive peak in the Fo – Fc difference electron density map (11.55σ).
The next highest peak in this difference map was 6.2σ. A distinctive
feature of the Mg2+ difference peak was its somewhat elongated
shape, suggesting potential disorder. Following refinement of a single
Mg2+ placed in the middle of the difference electron density
peak, positive peaks were observed on either side of its central location.
The Mg2+ ion was then modeled as two partially occupied
sites within the difference peak observed prior to its inclusion in
the model, and the occupancy of each site was adjusted manually based
on examination of difference electron density peaks leading to one
site (site B) with an occupancy of 0.65 and the other (site A), 0.35.
Similarly, there is evidence for disorder of one of the coordinating
water ligands for the bound Mg2+ in the form of an elongated
difference peak. Later stages of refinement were done using anisotropic
temperature factors in REFMAC5. For the
apo and Mn2+ structures, the final rounds of refinement
were carried out by using PHENIX with
isotropic temperature factor refinement. Statistics for refinements
are compiled in Table . Coordinates have been
deposited with the PDB under entries 4QH9, 4QHD, and 4QHE for Mn2+-bound, apo, and Mg2+-bound APE1 structures, respectively.

Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
Assays
Differential
scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays were
carried out in 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 4× SYPRO
orange (Invitrogen). The final concentration of full-length (FL) APE1
used in the DSF assays was 2 μM, diluted from a 2.48 mM stock
solution, buffered in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 100 mM NaCl. FL APE1
was incubated with 10 μM to 2.56 mM Mg2+ or Mn2+ for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of
SYPRO orange dye. Reactions were then measured using a Roche Light
Cycler 480 with an excitation wavelength of 483 nm and emission of
568 nm. The change in melting temperature (Tm) for each reaction was calculated by subtracting the Tm for the reaction containing no metal ion from
that containing metal and plotted against metal ion concentration.

Enzyme Assays
APE1 endonuclease assays were performed
as previously described using a fluorescently labeled substrate. Abasic DNA substrate used for the in
vitro abasic DNA cleavage assay was annealed from 5′-(HEX)-AATTCACCGGTACC(THF)CCTAGAATTCG-3′
and its complementary strand, where HEX is a hexachlorofluoroscein
tag at the 5′ end of the abasic site containing strand and
THF is tetrahydrofuran. The oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland
Certified Reagent. Reaction conditions were 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5),
50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mg/mL BSA, 20 nM DNA
substrate, and varying concentrations of FL APE1 enzymes, as specified,
in a final volume of 10 μL. Before use, FL APE1 enzyme stocks
were diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl,
1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT to a concentration 2-fold higher
than the final value.

Reactions were assembled on ice, and enzymes
were added to initiate the reaction. Reaction mixtures were incubated
at 37 °C for 15 min and then terminated by the addition of 10
μL of 99.5% formamide. Denatured DNA products were separated
on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea. All gels
were run in 1× TBE buffer (90 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM
EDTA) at 200 V for 1 h at room temperature. Following electrophoresis,
the HEX labeled DNA bands were visualized using an SHG 532 nm green
laser and LPG filter on a Fujifilm FLA-5100 system. Fluorescence was
quantified using Multi Gauge V3.1 software. For metal titration assays,
20 nM DNA substrate was incubated with 0.6 nM FL APE1 (WT) in a final
volume of 10 μL for 15 min at 37 °C in buffer as above
except that the MgCl2 or MnCl2 concentrations
were 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, or 8.0 mM. Specific activities were
determined for concentrations of enzyme within the linear range of
the assay and assigned values relative to the wild-type enzyme.

Results
Crystals of C138A Δ40 APE1 Diffract to High Resolution
To date, the crystal structures reported for APE1 all contain bound
metal, Mg2+, Pb2+, or Sm3+ ions,,, which appear to be required for
crystallization of wild-type or N-terminally truncated versions of
APE1. In this work, we sought to analyze the effects of metal binding
in APE1 at high resolution. Ideally, one would crystallize APE1 in
the presence and absence of metal ions in the same crystal form. To
accomplish this, we substituted a surface residue with the goal of
changing the packing interactions within the lattice and obtaining
APE1 crystals under conditions that would not require metal ions for
crystallization. We selected C138 for substitution due to its solvent
accessibility and tendency to form a disulfide bond with C138 from
a neighboring molecule in the samarium acetate crystal form. Substitution of Cys 138 with Ala does not affect
APE1’s endonuclease activity., Thus, we initially
prepared C138S and C138A Δ40 APE1, referring to an N-terminally
truncated form lacking 39 amino acids from the N-terminus. The C138S
Δ40 APE1 was even more soluble than the wild-type sequence and
did not crystallize in initial screening experiments. However, following
an incomplete factorial screen, crystals of the C138A Δ40 APE1
were obtained from a sodium chloride and PEG 4000 containing precipitant
solution without the use of divalent metal ions. We refer to this
structure as the apo structure of APE1 crystallized in the absence
of metal bound to the active site. We also cocrystallized APE1 in
the same lattice with either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Interestingly,
this is the same lattice that we obtained for C65A APE1, but, in that case, the crystallization conditions
contained Sm3+. These crystals diffract to high resolution
with complete data collected in the best case to 1.4 Å for the
Mg2+ complex (Table ). Data for
the apo and Mn2+ structures were collected to 1.65 and
2.2 Å, respectively, on our home source instrument (see ). The lower resolution of
the Mn2+ data set results from a strategy designed to collect
relatively complete anomalous data that would allow unambiguous identification
of metal binding sites in this structure. Previously, the highest
resolution structures reported were a 1.92 Å for the wild-type–Mg2+ complex and 1.9 Å for the C65A APE1. Thus, our crystals
exhibit a marked improvement in resolution, allowing us to analyze
alternate side chain conformations within the active site for the
Mg2+ and apo structures. The structures were determined
by molecular replacement and refined as described in the .

Mn2+ Binds to
D70 and E96 in the Active Site of APE1
It has been previously
shown that Mn2+ will effectively
substitute for Mg2+ to promote APE1 catalysis, albeit with
a pre-steady-state catalytic rate reduced by a factor of ∼1.5-fold,
as determined by rapid quench flow techniques. Structurally, Mn2+ has the advantage of having an anomalous
signal that can be measured using Cu Kα X-radiation. We determined
a 2.2 Å crystal structure for an APE1–Mn2+ complex
(Table ) and confirmed the site of bound Mn2+ by anomalous difference Fourier analysis (Figure A). A 14σ anomalous difference peak corresponds
to the refined Mn2+ position in our final model for this
complex, with D70 and E96 serving as coordinating ligands. There is
no anomalous peak consistent with binding of Mn2+ to a
second proposed metal site involving H309, D210, and N212 as coordinating
ligands. Thus, Mn2+ does not appear to bind to this second
site despite a much higher propensity to accept coordinating N atoms
as ligands than Mg2+. In the APE1–Mn2+ structure, Mn2+ is coordinated by one oxygen atom from
D70 and one from E96 with coordination distances of 2.3 and 2.1 Å,
respectively, and the four remaining ligands are water molecules with
coordinating distances of 2.2–2.4 Å (Figure B). The six coordinating ligands exhibit octahedral coordination
geometry for the Mn2+ bound to APE1. D308 is too far away
to coordinate Mn2+ directly but is hydrogen-bonded to two
of the coordinating water molecules at distances of 2.6 and 2.7 Å,
respectively. The only other residue within hydrogen-bonding distance
of a metal coordinating water molecule is K98.

Metal binding sites are
shown for Mn2+, Mg2+, and apo APE1 crystals
structures. In each panel, the protein model
is shown as a gray cartoon rendering, with D70, E96, and D308 shown
as stick renderings with carbons in yellow and oxygens in red. (A)
The anomalous difference Fourier map (magenta) contoured at 6σ
(magenta mesh) and 2Fo – Fc difference electron density map contoured
at 1.2σ (blue mesh) are shown for the Mn2+–APE1
complex structure. Both D70 and E96 directly coordinate the Mn2+ ion. (B) A cartoon and stick rendering of the metal binding
site as in panel A is shown with coordination distances for protein
and water ligands bound to Mn2+. (C) Initial Fo – Fc difference electron
density map contoured at 3σ (green mesh) and final 2Fo – Fc difference
electron density map contoured at 1.2σ (blue mesh) are shown
for the Mg2+–APE1 complex structure. Mg2+ atoms (pink spheres) and one water molecule (red spheres) are shown
modeled in the elongated Fo – Fc difference peaks. The Mg2+ site
denoted as the B site is shown in (D) and the A site in (E) along
with coordinating ligands and distances. (F) The final 2Fo – Fc electron density
map is shown for the metal binding site of apo APE1 structure (i.e.,
without bound metal). Red spheres are water molecules. (G) The metal
binding site in the apo structure is shown with a water molecule (red
sphere) coordinated to D70 and E96.

Mg2+ Exhibits Disorder within the Active Site of
APE1
In the crystal structure of the APE1–Mg2+ complex determined at 1.4 Å, a single elongated 11.55σ Fo – Fc peak
was identified as the Mg2+ binding site (Figure C). There is no evidence for Mg2+ bound
to another site in the Fo – Fc map. As described in the , refinement efforts led to a model with
two partially occupied Mg2+ sites that are 0.7 Å apart:
one involving coordination primarily with E96 (A site, 0.35 occupancy)
and the second involving coordination with both D70 and E96 (B site,
0.65 occupancy) (Figure D,E). The designations
of A and B in this context refer to alternate conformations for the
Mg2+ in our crystal structure and should not be confused
with previous reports in which a second proposed binding site involving
coordination with D210, N212, and H309 was referred to as the B site. As noted above, there is no evidence in our
structures for binding to this second site. The A site for Mg2+ in our structure is more closely associated with the A conformation
of E96 at a distance of 2.0 Å between the coordinating oxygen
and Mg2+. This same E96 coordinating oxygen is 2.4 Å
from the B site for Mg2+. Similarly, the coordinating oxygens
from D70 and the B conformation of E96 are 1.9 and 2.0 Å, respectively,
from Mg2+ in the B site, whereas that same D70 oxygen is
2.5 Å from Mg2+ in the A site (Figure D,E). Although three of the coordinating waters are in common,
there is evidence for one water ligand that is unique to each of the
two Mg2+ sites, providing further evidence for modeling
of two different Mg2+ positions. Coordinating waters are
1.9–2.5 Å from the metal positions. As was true in the
Mn2+ structure, D308 is 4.0 Å from the closest Mg2+ site and therefore not close enough to coordinate the metal
directly. However, D308 is hydrogen-bonded to two water molecules
that coordinate Mg2+ in the structure with distances of
2.7 and 2.8 Å. In this structure, K98 is too far away, but Y171
is hydrogen-bonded to one of the two coordinating water molecule conformations
associated with the disordered Mg2+ at a distance of 2.8
Å.

Glu 96 Adopts Three Different Conformations in APE1 Structures
In the apo structure, there is only one conformation observed for
E96 (Figure F), and in place of bound metal,
there is a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to D70 (2.66 Å) and
E96 (2.45 Å) (Figure G). Although the
apo protein and metal complexes reported here were crystallized in
the same lattice, there is some variation in b, the
longest cell parameter. In the Mg2+ complex structure, b is 137.5 Å, whereas in the other two structures,
apo and Mn2+ complex, b is approximately
141 Å (Table ). Structural differences
in the backbone atom positions that correlate with the difference
in this cell parameter include residues 77–86, 98–102,
and 106–113, which comprise surface loop and helical elements
in the structure (Figure A). Thus, the difference
observed in the position of K98 in the Mn2+ vs Mg2+ structure likely results from this difference in the b cell parameter.

Structural comparisons are shown for different APE1 structures.
(A) Differences between the Mg2+-bound APE1 (blue ribbon
rendering) and apo-APE1 (red) or Mn2+-bound APE1 (green)
structures are shown close-up and in the context of the full structure
(inset) for the surface loop (amino acids 98–102) and two alpha
helices (amino acids 77–86 and 106–113, respectively).
Structural differences appear to correlate with the length of the b cell axis (Table ), which is shorter
in the Mg2+-bound APE1 structure. (B) Active site residues
are shown in stick renderings with carbons in gray, oxygens in red,
and nitrogens in blue for superimposed structures of apo-APE1, APE1–Mg2+, and APE1–Mn2+. Overall, active site residues
in each of the structures have a single conserved conformation including
D210, N212, and H309 in all three structures. Small differences in
the conformation for Y171 were observed. Remarkably, three different
conformations for E96 were found in apo-APE1 (pink), APE1–Mg2+ (marine blue), and APE1–Mn2+ (yellow).
Mg2+ (marine blue) and Mn2+ (yellow) are depicted
as spheres in the active sites. (C) A comparison of our Mg2+-bound APE1 structure with that of a ternary complex with DNA and
Mg2+ bound to APE1 (PDB ID: 4IEM) reveals a single conformation for D210,
N212, and H309, as was true for our three structures. Differences
are observed in the conformations for E96 and R177 in the DNA-bound
complex (orange) due to intercalation in the DNA. Bound Mg2+ ions are shown as blue spheres for our structure and orange for
the DNA complex.

Of relevance to the present
study is an analysis of residues within
these three structures that vary in side chain conformation. Within
these three structures, 24 residues have side chain conformations
that differ significantly from one another. Most of these residues
are surface residues, with the most prevalent being Glu, Lys, and
Arg residues; see Table  for a complete list
of residues with varying side chain conformations. While some variations
in side chain conformation for surface residues may result from poorly
resolved density, residues within the active site, with few exceptions,
have well-ordered electron density. Overall, the structures of the
active site residues are remarkably similar in all of our structures.
Notably, important active site residues including D210, N212, and
H309 along with surrounding residues show no differences in conformation
in the three structures (Figure B). In the
mechanism proposed by Tainer et al., N212 and H309 play critical roles
in positioning the scissile P–O3′ bond for catalytis,
whereas D210 activates a nucleophilic water that attacks the bond. Small differences in the position of Y171 are
apparent in the three structures, but the only residue in the active
site that exhibits markedly different conformations in the metal-bound
versus apo structure is E96. The conformation of E96 observed in the
apo structure is clearly distinct from the E96 conformation observed
in the Mg2+- and Mn2+-bound structures (Figure B).

Conformational
Plasticity of E96 Correlates with Metal Binding
Sites Observed in APE1
The structures of the active sites
of APE1 with Mg2+ bound in the presence and absence of
abasic site containing DNA also show remarkably few differences. R177
in the product-bound complex intercalates at the abasic site adopting
a significantly different conformation than in the complex without
DNA, and Y171 adopts a slightly different conformation in the two
structures (Figure C). The only other residue
that adopts a significantly different conformation is E96. In the
DNA-bound complex, E96 serves as the sole protein ligand for bound
Mg2+ and adopts a conformation similar to that observed
in our apo structure (Figure D). Thus, collectively,
there are three different binding sites identified for Mg2+ and three different conformations for E96 in these two Mg2+-bound structures (Figures C). The first
conformation of E96 is also observed in the APE1–Mn2+ structure, with D70 and E96 ligands bound to the B site observed
in the Mg2+ structure (Figure A).
A second E96 conformation is observed for coordination to the A site
in the Mg2+ structure (Figure B),
and a third conformation of E96 observed in both the product complex
and the apo structure positions of E96 to coordinate metal and product
DNA in the APE1–Mg2+–DNA complex (Figure C,D). This metal binding site is 2.1 Å from
the Mg2+ site A in our structure that is coordinated primarily
by E96. Collectively, these different metal binding sites and conformations
of E96 may represent different sites of occupancy for the bound metal
ion and the ability to move from an initial capture site to a site
involving interaction with bound substrate.

Structural models suggest
movement of Mg2+ between an
initial capture site and a final DNA-bound position within the active
site of APE1. A gray cartoon rendering of the APE1 structure is shown
with stick models (carbons in specified colors; oxygens in red) for
D70 and E96. (A) Mg2+ (blue sphere) is bound in the B site
with E96-B conformation (blue stick) and coordinating waters (red
spheres) representing initial capture of the metal in the active site.
(B) Mg2+ shifts to bind in the A site to the E96-A conformation
(light green stick) and coordinating waters (red spheres), possibly
in an intermediate binding mode. The gray sphere indicates the position
of the B site Mg2+ metal. (C) In the presence of DNA, Mg2+ (pink sphere) bound to E96 shifts to interact with substrate
DNA in this catalytically competent mode. The gray stick rendering
is the A conformation of E96. The DNA-bound model is from the APE1–DNA
complex structure (PBD ID: 4IEM). (D) Mg2+ bound to E96 in 4IEM structure is superimposed
on the apo APE1 structure. The conformation of E96 within these two
structures is similar. Thus, the conformational plasticity of E96
may facilitate initial capture, an intermediate binding mode, and
a catalytically relevant binding mode for Mg2+.

D70, E96, and D308 Are Involved in Metal
Binding by APE1
To examine metal binding by APE1, we employed
differential scanning
fluorimetry (DSF) as a measure of metal binding through determination
of the melting temperatures. In this assay, the dye SYPRO orange was
used to monitor unfolding of the protein with increasing temperature;
the inflection point of the transition curve (Tm) is calculated from plotting the fluorescence intensity against
the temperature. Full-length APE1 was
used for these experiments. The melting temperature of APE1, as measured
by DSF, is ∼48–50 °C. Addition of increasing concentrations
of MgCl2 or MnCl2 increased the melting temperature
of APE1 by a maximum of 4.5–6.4 °C, respectively (Figure ), consistent with stabilization of the structure
upon binding of metal.

Effect of metal binding on the stability of wild-type,
D70A, E96A,
D70A/E96A, D308A, and full-length APE1. Differential scanning fluorimetry
was used to measure the change in melting temperature, which is plotted
versus the concentration of Mg2+ (A) or Mn2+ (B).

To determine the role of E96,
D70, and D308 in binding metal ions,
we prepared substituted full-length APE1 proteins D70A, E96A, D70A/E96A,
and D308A and measured binding of MgCl2 or MnCl2 at concentrations up to 2.6 mM using DSF. We elected to substitute
these acidic residues with Ala in order to ensure that no metal binding
through the side chain atoms would be possible. As a control to assess
metal binding in solution to the proposed site involving D210, N212,
and H309, we also prepared and analyzed D210A APE1. Melting temperatures
of D70, E96, D70/E96, and D308 were 50.3, 50.6, 50.0, and 48.2 °C,
respectively and thus were similar to the Tm of the wild-type protein, 48.4 °C. However, the D210A enzyme
exhibited a significantly lower melting temperature of 38.4 °C,
suggesting that this substitution was destabilizing and cannot be
compared directly to the other enzymes. The melting temperature of
D210A APE1 did increase by 2.5 °C maximally upon addition of
increasing concentrations of Mg2+. As shown in Figure , addition of metal to D70A, E96A, D70A/E96A, or
D308A proteins has no effect on the melting temperature, consistent
with loss of stabilization by metal. A slight decrease of −0.9
°C in the Tm was observed upon addition
of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ to the D70A APE1 protein.
Similar results were obtained for addition of Mg2+ or Mn2+ to E96A or the doubly substituted D70A/E96A APE1 proteins
with decreases of Tm of −0.9 and
−1.35 °C, respectively. The Tm for the D308A protein was unaffected by addition of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Thus, in the absence of bound substrate,
we conclude that D70, E96, and D308 play a role in metal binding,
resulting in stabilization of APE1. This result is consistent with
our crystallographic results for Mg2+- and Mn2+-bound complexes with APE1 in which both D70 and E96 directly coordinate
metal and D308 coordinates metal through a water molecule (Figure ).

D70A/E96A APE1 Shows Significantly Impaired
Enzymatic Activity
Having established a role for D70, E96,
and D308 in the binding
of metal as assessed by DSF, we next sought to determine the effects
of substituting these residues on catalytic activity. Enzymatic activity
for the endonuclease activity of wild-type, D70A, E96A, D70A/E96A,
D308A, and D210A enzymes was measured as previously described. The D70A and E96A enzymes exhibited modest decreases
of 8.7- vs 8.4-fold, respectively, in activity compared to that of
the wild-type protein, as shown in Table .
However, the D70A/E96A enzyme had significantly lower activity than
either single substitution, with an approximately 300-fold decrease
relative to that of the wild-type protein. In contrast, D308A has slightly higher than wild-type activity,
suggesting that, although it contributes to capture of metal under
the conditions used for DSF experiments, it plays a much less significant
role under the conditions of catalysis where the ratio of metal to
enzyme is at least 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in the DSF
assay. Thus, the relative contribution of D308 in binding metal is
smaller during catalysis. The D210A enzyme had no observable activity
under the conditions assayed.

Mg2+-Catalyzed APE1 Activity Is Higher than That
of Mn2+
Both Mg2+ and Mn2+ are coordinated by D70 and E96 in the absence of bound substrate
and coordinated by E96 alone in the presence of DNA product in crystal
structures. Thus, it was of interest to compare steady-state activity
of full-length APE1 catalyzed by Mg2+ or Mn2+ and determine optimal concentrations supporting activity. The concentration
of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ was varied from 0.25
to 8 mM for reactions containing 0.6 nM APE1, a concentration within
the linear response range of the assay. Under the conditions of our
assay, the cleavage rates for Mg2+ at low concentrations
of metal were approximately 1.7-fold higher than those for Mn2+ at the same concentrations, especially at the lower concentrations
used, as shown in Figure . However, each showed
optimal activity between 4 and 8 mM.

Comparison of catalytic activity supported
by varying concentrations
of Mg2+ or Mn2+. In this experiment, 0.6 nM
full-length APE1 (WT) was used in the reaction mixture containing
20 nM HEX labeled DNA substrate and increasing concentrations of MgCl2 or MnCl2 (i.e., 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0
mM). The percentage of cleaved product is represented as a function
of metal concentration. For all concentrations, activity catalyzed
by Mn2+ is lower than that of Mg2+.

Discussion
Collectively, our studies
support a role for a single preformed
metal binding site in APE1 involving D70, E96, and, to a lesser extent,
D308 in facilitating endonuclease activity. All three of these residues
appear to be essential for stabilization of the enzyme by Mg2+ or Mn2+ measured by DSF, as substitution with Ala for
any of these residues results in loss of stabilization. These findings
are supported by our structural results and those of others, in which D70 and E96 directly coordinate the bound metal and D308
is hydrogen-bonded to coordinating water ligands. No experimental
evidence was found for binding to the previously proposed B site involving
coordination by D210, N212, and H309, consistent with results reported from the solid state 25Mg NMR study.

To determine what
role a preformed metal binding site might play
in catalysis, we determined the enzymatic activity of D70A, E96A,
and D308A enzymes. Modest reductions in specific activity, 8.4- to
8.7-fold, were observed for D96A or E70A enzymes, respectively, and
slightly increased activity was observed for D308A (Table ). In previous reports for enzymatic analysis of
E96A APE1, reductions in activity range from 15-fold to 105-fold, with
several groups reporting 400- to 600-fold reductions.− Thus, we felt it was important to compare all of the substituted
APE1 enzymes prepared in the same way and to the same level of purity
in our system. Our results for E96A are in fairly close agreement
with the most recently reported 15-fold reduction in activity for
E96A. Our 8.7-fold reduction in D70A
APE1 activity is in close agreement with a previous report of a 6.7-fold
reduction in activity. Finally, we find
that D308A is slightly more active than that of wild-type enzyme,
while a previous study reported a modest 1.4-fold reduction in activity. These results suggest that substitution of one
of the three residues, D70, E96, or D308, involved in coordinating
metal has relatively modest effects on enzymatic activity. However,
the D70A/E96A enzyme had a much more profound effect and is ∼300-fold
less active than the wild-type enzyme and ∼30-fold less active
than the singly substituted enzymes, D70A and D96A APE1. These decreases
in activity are not comparable to those observed for residues involved
directly in the chemistry of the reaction such as D210 or H309, which
have reductions in activity of 30,000 and 25,000-fold, respectively.,− However, the decrease in activity observed for the
D70A/E96A APE1 enzyme is sufficiently large to suggest an important
role in the overall reaction. The proposed role for the single Mg2+ ion is to help position the substrate and stabilize the
transition state and 3′-OH leaving group. Although the substrate would likely have bound metal ions
associated with it, these metal ions would not be strategically located
to facilitate the reaction. Thus, potentially, the advantage of a
preformed metal binding site for the enzyme is the increase in effective
metal concentration at the desired site to promote catalysis.

Of particular interest was our finding that Mg2+ is
disordered in our 1.4 Å structure and exhibits two partially
occupied binding sites involving coordination by D70 and E96. Two
independent lines of evidence support this finding. In two other lower
resolution crystal structures available for APE1 with bound Mg2+ (PDB IDs: 4LND and 3U8U),
the position of Mg2+ corresponds to one or the other of
the two binding modes that we identified (Figure ). In solid-state 25Mg NMR studies, a single mole
equivalent of Mg2+ was bound to APE1 in both the presence
and absence of bound THF containing oligonucleotide substrate with
two distinct resonances for Mg2+. This result is consistent
with disorder of the Mg2+ due to differences in coordinating
ligands and thus plasticity in the active site. Our results now provide a structural context for the observed
disorder of bound Mg2+ in the absence of bound DNA and
implicate E96 as the residue conferring plasticity to the active site.
These results set the stage for the ability of Mg2+ to
move in the enzyme.

A comparison of coordinating ligands and distances for
Mg2+-bound APE1 structures. Two other structures from the
PDB, 4LND (A)
and 3U8U (B),
are shown superimposed
on our Mg2+–APE1 structure. A cartoon rendering
of our APE1 structure is shown in lime green. (A) The B conformation
of E96 from our Mg2+ structure (marine blue) is in a similar
conformation to that of E96 in 4LND (pink, oxygens in red). The A conformation
of E96 is shown in gray. (B) The A conformation of E96 in our Mg2+ structure shown in lime green is in a similar conformation
to that of E96 in 3U8U shown in orange; oxgyens are shown in red. The B conformation of
E96 is shown in gray. D70 is shown in a stick rendering with carbons
in blue and oxygens in red for our structure, with carbons in pink
for 4LND (A)
and with carbons in orange for 3U8U (B). Bound Mg2+ for our structure
is shown as a blue sphere in (A) and a green sphere in (B). Mg2+ in 4LND is shown as a pink sphere in (A) and in 3U8U is shown as an orange sphere in (B).

As observed in pre-steady-state
measurements of APE1’s endonuclease
activity, under steady-state conditions
as shown in Figure , the rate of reaction
for Mn2+ is also slower than that for Mg2+ at
lower concentrations, but it is more similar at higher concentrations.
In crystal structures of APE1–DNA–Mn2+ and
APE1–DNA–Mg2+ complexes, Mn2+ and
Mg2+ are both coordinated by E96 and the DNA product, and
in APE1–Mg2+ and APE1–Mn2+ structures,
the metals are coordinated by D70 and E96. However, we did not observe
disorder in Mn2+ binding in our APE1–Mn2+ structure as was observed for Mg2+. On the basis of structural
analysis, we cannot determine whether this is a property of Mn2+ vs Mg2+ or whether the much lower resolution
of the Mn2+ structure masks this type of disorder. The
fact that the Mn2+-catalyzed endonuclease reaction is slower
in both pre-steady-state and steady-state
experiments suggests that there may be differences in the reaction
catalyzed by Mn2+ vs Mg2+. One possibility is
that the larger size of Mn2+ affects its ability to move
similarly to Mg2+ within the active site and thereby affects
the rate of the reaction, as previously suggested.

In conclusion, our studies provide evidence for initial
capture
of metal ion in the active site of APE1 by D70 and E96 and suggest
that this capture is important for catalysis. Our structures provide
evidence for structural plasticity within the active site involving
E96, which directly coordinates Mg2+ and is captured in
three different conformations. This novel plasticity observed for
E96 provides a possible mechanism for binding of Mg2+ in
three different positions all involving coordination with E96, two
observed in our APE1–Mg2+ structure and the third
in the product DNA complex structure (4IEM).
