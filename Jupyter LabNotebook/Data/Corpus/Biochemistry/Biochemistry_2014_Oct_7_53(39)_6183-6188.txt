The Erwinia ligand-gated
ion channel (ELIC) is a cation-selective GABA-gated
ion channel originally identified in the enterobacterium Erwinia
chrysanthemii. ELIC shares considerable structural homology
with eukaryotic Cys-loop receptors, a class of neurotransmitter-gated
ion channels that underpin fast synaptic transmission. One of the
major problems in understanding the mechanisms of action of this family
of channels is the paucity of high-resolution structures. An X-ray
crystal structure of ELIC was determined in 2008, and the following
year, the structure of the Gloeobacter ligand-gated
ion channel or GLIC, from the bacterium Gloeobacter violaceous, was determined.− These bacterial receptors were found to share many
structural features
with Cys-loop receptors, although they do not possess an N-terminal
α-helix, an intracellular domain, or the disulfide-bonded loop
that gives the eukaryotic family its name. GLIC is activated
by protons and ELIC by a range of small amine molecules, including
GABA., The potency of GABA at ELIC is low compared
to those of its eukaryotic
counterparts, but work on bacterial receptors in other systems, suggests that even if the potencies are not in the same range, their
mechanisms of action at homologous proteins are similar, making ELIC
an attractive model system for understanding the molecular mechanisms
of Cys-loop receptors.

ELIC shows a low level of sequence identity
with Cys-loop receptors
overall, but many key features are conserved. The functional receptor
is pentameric, with a large extracellular domain (ECD) that contains
the ligand binding site and a transmembrane domain (TMD) consisting
of four α-helices from each subunit (termed M1–M4). The
M2 α-helix from each subunit lines the pore, and this region
in particular is highly homologous in sequence (&gt;60%) to Cys-loop
receptors. It is, however, unusual
in that it contains a large aromatic Phe residue that points into
the pore lumen (Figure ). This was proposed
as a reason that ELIC
was not functional in early studies that sought to identify an activating
ligand, a hypothesis supported by studies of molecular dynamics and
Brownian dynamics. Subsequent studies
have shown that ELIC is readily opened
by a range of amine molecules,, and even when mutations
are introduced to prevent desensitization, the structure of the pore
is such that the Phe is present in the lumen. As the pore has been used as a model for Cys-loop receptors,
the aim of this study was to probe the role of this Phe residue, to
determine if the ELIC channel is indeed representative of Cys-loop
receptor pores.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Picrotoxinin (PXN) was
kindly provided by
R. Duke (University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia) after separation
and purification by recrystallization following short column vacuum
chromatography from picrotoxin purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich Australia. All other regents were from Sigma-Aldrich
and of the highest grade that could be obtained.

Cell Culture
and Oocyte Maintenance
Xenopus
laevis oocyte-positive females were purchased from NASCO
(Fort Atkinson, WI) and maintained according to standard methods.
Harvested stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were washed
in four changes of Ca2+-free ND96 [96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl,
1 mM MgCl2,
and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)], defolliculated in 1.5 mg mL–1 collagenase type 1A for approximately 2 h, washed again in
four changes of ND96, and stored in ND96 at 16 °C containing
2.5 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 mM gentamycin, and 0.7 mM
theophylline.

Receptor Expression
ELIC (GenBank
accession number ADN00343.1) was kindly provided by
C. Ulens. For expression in Xenopus oocytes, it was
cloned into pGEMHE with the signal sequence of the
human α7 nACh receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed
with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). cRNA
was transcribed in vitro from the linearized pGEMHE
cDNA template using the mMessage mMachine T7 transcription
kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with
20 ng of cRNA, and currents were recorded 1–3 days postinjection.

Electrophysiology
Using two-electrode voltage clamp, Xenopus oocytes were clamped at −60 mV using an OC-725
amplifier (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), Digidata
1322A, and the Strathclyde Electrophysiology Software Package (Department
of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow,
U.K.). Currents were recorded at 5 kHz and filtered at a frequency
of 1 kHz. Microelectrodes were fabricated from borosilicate glass
(GC120TF-10, Harvard Apparatus,
Edenbridge, Kent, U.K.) using a one-stage horizontal pull (P-87, Sutter
Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and filled with 3 M KCl. Pipette resistances
ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 MΩ. Oocytes were perfused with ND96 at
a constant rate of
12 mL min–1 with complete solution exchange within
5 s. Drug application
was accomplished via a simple gravity-fed system calibrated to run
at the same rate. Inhibition by test compounds was measured at the
GABA EC50 for each mutant.

Analysis and curve fitting
were performed using Prism version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA). Concentration–response data for each oocyte were normalized
to the maximal current for that oocyte and the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) for a series of oocytes pooled and plotted
against agonist or antagonist concentration and iteratively fit to
the four-parameter logistic equation. Statistical analysis was performed
using a Student’s t test.

Docking
The three-dimensional structure of PXN was
extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database (reference code PXN
= CIBCUL10), and the protonated form was constructed using
Chem3D Ultra 7.0 (CambridgeSoft, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and energy-minimized
using the MM2 force field. Docking was as described previously using an ELIC crystal structure (entry 2VL0) downloaded from
the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Docking of PXN into ELIC was conducted
using GOLD 3.0 (The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre, Cambridge,
U.K.). The binding site was constrained as a docking sphere with a
20 Å radius surrounding either the Cα atom of
residue
6′ or 16′ in chains A and C. Ten genetic algorithm runs
were performed on each docking exercise using default parameters.
The structures were visualized using PyMOL version 1.3 and ViewerLite
version 5.0.

Results
Activation of ELIC by GABA
ELIC has been previously
shown to be activated by a range of small molecules containing an
amine group, including cysteamine and GABA., Here
we used GABA, and its application produced large, concentration-dependent,
reversible inward currents. Plotting peak current amplitude against
a range of GABA concentrations yielded an EC50 of 1.6 mM
(pEC50 = 2.78 ± 0.04; n = 7) and
a Hill slope of 2.5 ± 0.7, similar to the values found in other
studies.,

Mutant Receptors
To explore the
role of phenylalanine
in the pore of ELIC we substituted this residue with a selection of
other amino acids covering a range of sizes and hydrophobicities,
and we also introduced negatively charged residues as molecular dynamic
simulation data have suggested that this will favor the open channel. We observed some increases in EC50 compared
to those of wild-type receptors when we substituted Phe16′
with Glu, Leu, and Thr, but there were no significant changes to EC50 with Ala, Asp, Gln, Trp, or Tyr (Table ). These data show many residues are tolerated at this location,
and that no specific chemical properties (such as aromaticity or hydrophobicity)
are required. The negatively charged amino acids Glu and Asp have
different effects: Asp at this position yielded an EC50 similar to those of wild-type receptors, while Glu caused
a 16-fold increase in EC50. As residue 16′ is some
distance from the binding site,
these data suggest that it may play some minor role in channel gating
(as the term EC50 includes contributions from both binding
and gating), although
we cannot rule out the fact that this and some of the other mutations
may cause a global structural change that affects the binding site.
However, as many pore-lining substitutions in many Cys-loop receptors
have not been reported to cause a global structural change, we consider
this less likely. The largest change in EC50 was for Leu,
which is surprising as Leu is found at position
16′ in many nACh receptor subunits, but these data are consistent
with the fact that the structure in this region differs from that
of its eukaryotic relatives.

We also made mutations at the Q2′ and T6′ positions. Q2′N, T6′A and T6′S mutations caused no change to the GABA EC50 values. Q2′A receptors did not respond to application of 100 mM GABA suggesting that they were either non-functional or not expressed. F16′S in combination with T6′S (T6′S/F16′S) caused no significant increase in EC50.

PXN Inhibition
Wild-type ELIC was
inhibited by PXN
with an IC50 of 72 μM, similar to previous findings. This
value is considerably lower than values
reported for GLIC and other Cys-loop receptors where it is known to
bind in the pore and suggests that PXN mediates its action in ELIC
by binding elsewhere on the protein. Given the homology between the
M2 regions of all these receptors, it is surprising that PXN cannot
bind, and thus, we considered whether a PXN binding site could exist
in the pore and whether PXN cannot access this site because of the
narrow entrance resulting from the presence of a ring of Phe residues
at position 16′. We therefore examined the potency of PXN over
a range of mutant receptors where the size of the residue was varied.
These data showed that substitution with residues smaller than Phe
increased PXN potency (Table ,  and Figure ), resulting in IC50 values more
similar to those observed with GLIC and Cys-loop receptors. A plot
of pIC50 versus side chain size (Figure ) shows a distinct relationship (R2 = 0.7), supporting our hypothesis, although
there are some anomalies, such as the relatively high IC50 for F16′A; we speculate that this may be due to extra flexibility
in this region caused by insertion of a small residue.

Combining the F16′S and T6′S mutations ablated the increase in PXN potency, indicating that even when PXN can access the pore, it has specific binding requirements which involve T6′ (Table ).

Proadifen Inhibition
To further
confirm our hypothesis
that high-affinity inhibition by PXN depends on it being able to access
its binding site deep in the pore and was not due to changes in other
properties caused by the mutations, we examined inhibition by another
compound that does not act via a pore binding site. Proadifen was
one of the most potent inhibitors we previously identified in ELIC
with an IC50 of 8 μM. Unlike that of PXN, the potency of this compound did
not change when we examined its effects in F16′S, T6′S and F16′S/T6′S mutant ELIC (Table ), consistent
with a site of action that is not in the ion-permeable pore. These
data also support
our assumption that there has been no global change in the structure
of ELIC caused by the pore-lining mutations.

Docking Data
The
binding orientation and location of
PXN have been studied in a number of Cys-loop receptors using ligand
docking (with homology models where structures are not known) and
have shown that it is deep in the pore, close to positions −2′,
2′, and/or 6′. These data
allow potential molecular interactions to be identified and tested.
As the structure of ELIC is known, it provides the opportunity for
similar in silico studies here, although some caution
must be applied, as the structure most likely is in the closed state.
We docked PXN into the ELIC pore and identified possible binding poses
in two regions: above F16′ and close to position 6′.
Examination of multiple poses for those molecules bound close to F16′
revealed that the locations of PXN were broadly similar but that there
were some variations in orientations; a similar finding was observed
for PXN bound close to position 6′ (see Figure ). One orientation of PXN close to
position 6′ is shown in Figure , where
it can be seen to be stabilized by several hydrogen bonds with the
Thr residues at position 6′,
which is consistent with a high-affinity binding site at this location. These data
therefore support our hypothesis that PXN could bind in the pore with
high affinity at a location that would be expected given its homology
to Cys-loop receptor pores.

Discussion
ELIC
is a cationic GABA-gated bacterial ligand-gated ion channel
that is functionally and structurally similar to vertebrate GABA-gated
receptors. ELIC has the advantage of
a known high-resolution
structure,
making it a potentially useful system for understanding structure–function
relationships in eukaryotes. However, the ELIC pore is unusual as
it possesses a Phe residue at position 16′ that faces into
the channel lumen (Figure ); this might be
expected to impede channel
access. Here we show that this is the case for the channel blocking
compound PXN, but increasing or decreasing the size of residue 16′
does not cause major changes to GABA-induced activation, indicating that
the properties of the residue at this location do not significantly
modify receptor function.

We have previously shown
that many Cys-loop receptor pore blockers
also block the pores of ELIC and GLIC but are generally less potent
at ELIC., Docking studies indicate that the 2′
and/or 6′ channel-lining
residues are likely binding sites for many of these compounds in ELIC,
and there are many mutagenesis studies in Cys-loop receptors that
demonstrate the importance of these two residues (e.g., refs (−)). Similarly, mutations of residues 2′ and 6′ in ELIC
abolish inhibition by α-endosufan, one of the most potent noncompetitive
antagonists of this receptor, supporting a binding location close
to these two residues. However, despite the similarity of pore-lining
residues, PXN is more than 1 order of magnitude less potent in ELIC
than in GLIC, where it has a potency similar to those of Cys-loop
receptors., The data presented here provide
a solution to this apparent conundrum,
as substitution of Phe16′ with a smaller residue such as Ser
results in an IC50 for PXN (4.5 μM) that is similar
to that observed for GLIC (2.6 μM) and those observed for Cys-loop
receptors., Substitution with a larger residue,
such as Trp, has no effect on
the PXN IC50. Our data therefore suggest that Phe at position
16′ sterically blocks the access of large pore binding antagonist
molecules to the channel, while smaller residues do not. The fact
that high concentrations of PXN block wild-type ELIC suggests that
it has a low-affinity site of action elsewhere on the protein, as
has been also suggested for GABAA receptors (e.g., ref ()).

Our data support
our in silico studies that indicate
the PXN pore binding site is close to position 6′: mutation
of this residue has a significant effect on potency only when the
residue is accompanied by an F16′S mutation, suggesting that
PXN can enter the pore and bind close to residue 6′ only when
there is a small residue at position 16′. A site of action
at position 6′ is consistent with the effects of mutating homologous
residues in 5-HT3, GABA, and glycine receptors; in these
proteins, alterations to residue 6′ have significant effects
on the sensitivity of PTX,,, and these results are therefore similar to the results we obtained
in our modified ELIC. It should be noted, however, that in GluCl picrotoxin
may bind in a slightly different location, as the structural data
reveal it is located further to the intracellular side of the pore,
close to residue −2′.

We also probed inhibition by the local anesthetic proadifen. This
is not a classic Cys-loop channel blocker, although
inhibitory effects have been reported. The IC50 values for proadifen did not change
much with any of the pore-lining mutations. These data support the
proposal that proadifen stabilizes the desensitized state of the receptor
by acting at a site outside the channel pore,
as has been proposed for nACh receptors, and also supports our suggestion that the pore mutations
do not globally change ELIC structure. Binding sites outside the pore
have been identified using mutagenesis, photolabeling in Cys-loop
receptors, and crystal structures of ELIC and GLIC bound
with the general anesthetics bromoform, propofol, and desfluorane.−

Our data also reveal that F16′ can be substituted with
residues
that have quite distinct chemical properties without having major
effects on EC50 values, as previously shown for an F16′A
mutant (&lt;10-fold change in cysteamine EC50), indicating
that the residue
at this location does not significantly affect receptor function.
The largest changes we observed in EC50 (32- and 16-fold)
were for F16′L and F16′E, respectively. An increase
with F16′L was unexpected as residue 16′ is Leu in many
Cys-loop receptors. We speculate it may be less favorable in ELIC
because of the adjacent Tyr: recent studies have shown an
engineered ring of F16′ residues in the nACh receptor results
in a novel refractory conformation; however, in combination with an
engineered ring of Y17′ residues, there was a high open probability
even in the absence of ligand. Thus,
the context of amino acids in the pore is critical in this region.

The increase observed for the F16′E alteration was less
unexpected: charged residues are rarely found lining Cys-loop pores,
where presumably they could inhibit ion flux (e.g., by repelling or
binding to charged ions passing through the channel),
or they may be thermodynamically unfavorable (e.g., similar charges
may face each other).
Nevertheless, a recent molecular dynamics study probing the possible
effect of F16′E in ELIC concluded that such an alteration would
have a favorable effect on the receptor: it suggested that the pore
would be more
hydrated, and the protein would have a more dynamic channel, exhibiting
more movement of the pore-lining α-helices. However, our observed increase in EC50 suggests
it is less favorable. We did not observe a similar increase with F16′D,
suggesting
that the longer side chain of Glu is responsible. Substitutions with
Ser and Thr also caused small increases in EC50, but all
were &lt;10-fold, indicating no major effect. Replacement with Trp
had no effect,
demonstrating that there is sufficient space at this location to accommodate
a residue even larger than Phe.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated
that the F16′ residue
at the extracellular end of the ELIC pore does not play a major role
in the function of the protein, as its replacement with a range of
other amino acids has no major effect on GABA-activated currents. This
residue may, however, prevent access of large, pore-blocking antagonists
from reaching their binding sites lower in the channel. Overall, our
data can explain why channel blockers have lower potencies in ELIC
than at either GLIC or Cys-loop receptors and show that using ELIC
as a model for interactions with such compounds (for in silico and functional studies) is likely to be more accurate if their entry
into the pore is permitted by substitutions of F16′.
