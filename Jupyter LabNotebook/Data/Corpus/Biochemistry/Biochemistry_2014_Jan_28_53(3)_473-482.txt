Binuclear
non-heme iron enzymes
are an expanding class that carries out a variety of important reactions
through dioxygen activation. Some of the most-studied enzymes in this
class are ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which initiates radical chemistry to generate DNA building blocks,
methane monooxygnease (MMO), which hydroxylates
methane to methanol, and Δ9 desaturase (Δ9D), which inserts a double bond
into fatty acids to produce lipid precursors. Crystallographic− and spectroscopic− studies have shown that these enzymes share a common 2-His/4-carboxylate
ligand set where the diiron core in the biferrous active site is weakly
magnetically coupled through two μ-1,3-carboxylate bridges.
In these enzymes, the diiron site serves as a “cofactor”,
since it rapidly reacts with and activates O2 and remains
tightly bound throughout the reaction with substrate. Diferric-peroxo
(DFP) intermediates have been observed− for all three of the
above enzymes, which further convert into high-valent intermediates
in RNR and MMO.

In contrast, the two ferrous ions are the “substrate”
in the ferritins, as these enzymes perform a ferroxidase reaction
to generate an oxo/hydroxo diferric product, which is then released
from the site and stored in a nanocage as a ferric mineral core. Each catalytic subunit contains a ferroxidase
site that catalyzes this reaction between the biferrous center and
O2. A similar DFP intermediate from fast dioxygen reaction
has been observed during the ferroxidation reaction.,

To understand the unique ferroxidase reaction in the substrate
site of the ferritins, crystallographic and spectroscopic studies
on bullfrog M ferritin have been performed.− Crystal structures of the active sites are shown in Figure . These crystal structures were obtained with divalent
proxies (i.e., Mg(II), Co(II), and Cu(II)) for Fe(II), since the Fe(II)
substrate rapidly reacts with O2, and thus only ferric
structures have been observed in the vicinity of the ferritin active
sites after soaking ferritin protein crystals in solutions of Fe(II)., For this reason, protein crystallography of ferritin is a less informative
probe of metal binding at the active site than for the related proteins
where diiron sites remain occupied. Although the three crystal structures
with different divalent metals display variations in the ligand set
of one metal site (M2 in Figure ) and the
binding mode of the terminal carboxylate to the other metal site (M1,
Figure ),,, it is clear that the substrate site has a coordinating
environment that is distinct from that of the cofactor sites, as it
has only one μ-1,3 carboxylate bridge and is more weakly bound
to the protein (Figure ). This structural
difference allows the diferric product to leave the active site for
formation of the ferric mineral core.

A combined spectroscopic methodology
of circular dichroism (CD),
magnetic CD (MCD), and variable-temperature, variable-field (VTVH)
MCD has been applied to define the wild-type (WT) substrate site in
M ferritin under biologically relevant solution conditions, enabling its comparison to the binuclear non-heme
iron cofactor sites.−, CD and MCD spectroscopies
probe the ligand-field (LF) transitions characteristic of the coordination
of each iron in the active site. These transitions can be correlated
to a specific iron center based on their VTVH MCD behavior. This methodology also determines the zero-field
splitting (ZFS, D (axial), E (rhombic))
of each Fe(II) and exchange coupling (J) between
two iron centers (reflecting bridging).

The spectra obtained
for the biferrous active site of the ferritin
showed 4 LF transitions that were paired by their VTVH MCD behaviors.
Based on their LF splitting patterns, the two sets of transitions
identified two inequivalent 5-coordinate irons in the active site
(Figure b). This result indicates that the
substrate site is ligated by one water on each iron in addition to
the protein-based ligands, as shown in Figure a, with an open coordinate position on each iron that could react
with O2 in a bridged structure. The water in the active
site was thought to be important in the formation of the diferric
oxo/hydroxo species, since the protons provided by the coordinated
water would facilitate the decay of the DFP intermediate.

active site structure of WT M ferritin; and (b) its
CD and MCD spectra. Coordination number for each iron site was obtained
from VTVH MCD data. Adapted and modified from ref ().

In a study by Tosha et al., the substrate site in M ferritin
was
modified by substituting two of the natural amino acids of the Fe2
site with those found in the cofactor sites, creating the Q137E/D140H
double variant. However, the kinetic
results indicate that despite having the same ligand set, the double
variant was not converted into a cofactor site in that the double
variant exhibited very slow O2 reaction without the observed
formation of a DFP intermediate.

In the present study, we have
applied CD/MCD/VTVH MCD spectroscopic
methodology to define the geometric and electronic structure of the
biferrous active site in the Q137E/D140H double variant of M ferritin
and to correlate this structure with its slow O2 reactivity.
The CD/MCD/VTVH MCD spectra of two single variants (D140H and Q137E)
were obtained in parallel and compared to the WT M ferritin spectra
(Figure b) to evaluate the structural contribution
associated with each ligand substitution, in order to elucidate the
double-variant active site ligation. Comparison of the ferritin double
variant active site obtained in this study to that of D84E RNR, which
has the same ligand set but rapidly reacts with O2, revealed
important factors required for an effective O2 reaction.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
MOPS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich),
sodium chloride (EMD Chemicals, Inc.), deuterium oxide (99.9 atom
% D, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), d3-glycerol (98 atom % D, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories),
and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate (Baker) were purchased commercially
and used as obtained. Before being cycled into the glovebox (&lt;1
ppm O2), D2O was made anaerobic by pumping it
with argon gas (99.9% pure) for ∼5 h, and d3-glycerol was degassed by heating it
for ∼8 h under vacuum (10–3 Torr). Fe(II)
stock solutions, used for reconstitution of the apoprotein, were freshly
prepared before each experiment by adding anaerobic D2O
to a premeasured amount of solid ferrous sulfate in the glovebox.

A QuikChange Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for site-directed
mutagenesis on frog M-ferritin in pET-3a, and recombinant ferritin
variants were expressed in Escherichia coli, and then purified as previously described., To remove iron from the core and potential binding sites, anaerobic
reductive dialysis was performed in the presence of dithiothreitol. For near-infrared (NIR) MCD measurements, the
protein buffer solution was exchanged with a deuterium oxide buffer
solution of 100 mM MOPS buffer (with100 mM NaCl) at pD = 7.0 until
D2O comprised more than 99.5% of the solvent. This protein
solution was concentrated to 1–7 mM diiron active centers
(0.04–0.3 mM protein nanocages) and degassed by rapidly purging
with vacuum and argon cycles for ∼30 min.

Samples were
studied in the absence of dioxygen (glovebox with
an N2 atmosphere). CD samples were prepared by adding incremental
amounts of Fe(II) stock solution to the degassed apoprotein solution
and incubating for ∼15 min. An anaerobic quartz cuvette was
used, and the sample temperature was kept constant by a circulating
water bath. The biferrous active site was also monitored by CD for
any effect on the active site due to the glycerol. MCD samples were
prepared by adding 2 Fe(II)/active site (determined based on anaerobic
CD titration results; see ) and rapidly mixing the protein solution with d3-glycerol (50% v/v for the final concentration)
until the sample became homogeneous. The protein samples were then
injected into the MCD cell (with a 0.2–0.3 cm–1 thick spacer between two quartz windows), and immediately frozen
in liquid N2.

Spectroscopic Methods
NIR (600–2000
nm; 5000–16 666 cm–1) CD and MCD data
were collected on a Jasco J730 spectrapolarimeter operating with a
liquid N2-cooled InSb detector. The MCD spectra were obtained
at various fields up to 7 T and temperatures between 1.6 and 15 K,
using an Oxford magnet (either SM 4–7T or SM 4000–7T).
The sample temperature was measured with a calibrated Cernox resistor
(Lakeshore Cryogenics) inserted into the MCD cell. For each field
and temperature, MCD spectra were baseline-corrected by subtracting
the apoprotein spectrum and by averaging the (+) and (−) signals.
VTVH MCD data were collected for 7 isotherms (1.8 K, 3 K, 5 K, 7.5
K, 10 K, 15 K, 25 K) at variable fields (0 T, 0.7 T, 1.4 T, 2.1 T,
2.8 T, 3.5 T, 4.2 T, 4.9 T, 5.6 T, 6.3 T, 7.0 T), and normalized to
the observed intensity at lowest temperature and highest field (1.8
K, 7 T) for all isotherms taken at a given wavelength.

The CD
and MCD spectra were simultaneously fit with Gaussian bandshapes to
find the minimum number of peaks required. The VTVH MCD data were
fit using the approaches described in the . A goodness-of-fit parameter and visual comparison
of the simulations to the data with error bars were used to determine
final fit results.

Results and Analysis
D140H Variant
(Reported as EQH mutant in ref ())
The D140H single
amino acid substitution changes the Asp140 in Figure a to a His residue. If this His binds to the Fe2 site, only
one of the two Fe(II) centers should be affected by this ligand change.
The CD and MCD spectra of this variant are shown in Figure a and are different from those of the biferrous
active site in WT ferritin in Figure b. The
CD data show changes in more than two features in the spectrum, reflecting
the sensitivity of CD to conformational changes in the vicinity of
the site. MCD, by contrast, focuses directly on the electronic structure
of the biferrous center. All the transitions in the D140H ferritin
MCD spectrum are at energies similar to those of the WT site, indicating
that this site has two inequivalent 5-coordinate (5C) iron centers.
However, relative to the WT MCD spectrum in Figure b, this alteration perturbs the feature at 7600 cm–1, which loses intensity, and the feature at 11 100 cm–1, which changes sign from positive to negative (Figure a, bottom). This perturbation of two LF transitions
indicates that the His ligand binds to one of the two ferrous centers
of the active site and that the two perturbed LF transitions are associated
with that Fe. From Figure , the His would
coordinate to Fe2.

K) spectra

site in the D140H ferritin single variant. The experimental data are
shown in the black line and the Gaussian bands from simultaneous peak
fit are shown in color (overall fit, red; each peak, green, blue,
cyan, and pink). Spectra require 4 LF transitions from two inequivalent
irons. Arrow indicates the energy where VTVH data were collected;
(b) VTVH data collected at 5530 cm–1 (green points
with error bars) and the obtained doublet fit (solid line).

The VTVH MCD data on the D140H
ferritin were collected at 5530
cm–1 (arrow in Figure a)
and fit using the two methods (equations S1–S3) in . Each ferrous center has
a ground state with S = 2. These two iron centers
can undergo both single center ZFS and exchange coupling between the
centers, thus leading to a complicated set of ground state non-Kramer
doublets for the biferrous active site (see ). In the first method, sums of non-Kramers
doublets are used to fit the ground state parameters (g-tensor with Ms value) and the excited state energies
of the combined metal site (, doublet model). Because exchange coupling (J)
between two ferrous centers is comparable to the ZFS of each iron
(D, E), both J and
ZFS (D, E) were considered together
in a spin-Hamiltonian analysis of the doublet fit results to describe
the ground state electronic structures (). In the second method, each electronic transition was correlated
to a specific iron center using the fact that the MCD intensity is
proportional to the spin-expectation values of the single iron center
in the binuclear ferrous wavefuctions (, spin-projection model).

From the doublet fit, the
lowest doublet gave the parameters of g∥ = 8 and δ0 = 4.1 cm–1, which
indicate an Ms = ±2 ground state.
At around 15 K, a low-lying excited state
starts to populate, requiring an additional excited-state doublet
to fit the VTVH MCD data in Figure b. The
best fit was obtained with g|| = 4, which
is associated with the Ms = ±1 sublevel,
at an excited state energy of ∼6 cm–1.

A spin-Hamiltonian analysis was then used to define the range of J, D, and E/D values for the biferrous site associated with the doublet fit parameters
obtained above. A fit of the VTVH MCD data in Figure b to the spin-Hamiltonian gives −15 cm–1 &lt; D1 &lt; −12 cm–1 (E1/D1 =
0.3–0.33), 10 cm–1 &lt; D2 &lt; 12 cm–1 (E2/D2 = 0.2–0.25) with −1
cm–1 &lt; J &lt; 0 cm–1, showing that the two Fe(II) centers are weakly antiferromagnetically
coupled and that the single mutation did not significantly perturb
the weak bridging interaction present in the WT enzyme (J ≈ −0.3 cm–1).

The saturation magnetization behavior of the data
in Figure b was then correlated to a specific
Fe(II) center,
using the spin-projection model described in . From this analysis, the Fe(II) center associated
with the transition at 4775 cm–1 in Figure a was shown to have a ZFS of −14.6 ±
1 cm–1 and E/D ≈ 0.33 ().
This spin projection analysis also gives the exchange coupling J ≈ −0.16 ± 0.15 cm–1, which is consistent with the spin-Hamiltonian analysis of the doublet
model fit to the VTVH MCD data in Figure b.

Q137E Single Variant (reported as EED mutant
in ref ())
The Q137E single amino acid substitution changes Gln137 (amide) in
Figure a to a Glu residue (carboxylate), which
is capable of binding to both iron sites (i.e., to form a second bridge).
The CD and MCD spectra for this variant are shown in Figure a. Compared to the spectrum of WT ferritin (Figure b), the CD and MCD spectral features from both iron
centers are perturbed. Their simultaneous Gaussian peak fit requires
3 LF transitions, at 4500, 8400, and 10 300 cm–1. The band at 10 300 cm–1 could reflect
an Fe site that is 5C (paired with the 4500 cm–1 transition) or 6C (paired with the 8400 cm–1 transition).
However, the two bands at 10 300 cm–1 and
8400 cm–1 showed different binding behaviors in
a CD titration of the apoprotein with Fe(II) (), indicating that these two transitions
are from different iron centers. Based on the different binding behaviors,
the band at 10 300 cm–1 (paired with 4500
cm–1) reflects 5C iron site, and the band at 8400
cm–1 reflects another 5C iron site. Therefore, the
biferrous active site coordination is determined to be 5C + 5C iron
centers. Although the coordination numbers of both irons are the same
as the WT ferritin, the large LF changes for both Fe(II) centers indicate
that both irons are perturbed by the Q to E mutation, indicating formation
of a second carboxylate bridge between the two Fe centers.

Spectra of
the Q137E ferritin single variant: (a) CD (290 K) spectra
(top) and MCD (1.8 K, 7 T) spectra (bottom) of the biferrous active
site in the Q137E ferritin single variant. The experimental data are
shown in the black line and the Gaussian bands from simultaneous peak
fit are shown in color (overall fit, red; each peak, blue, pink, and
cyan). Spectra require 3 LF transitions from two inequivalent iron
centers. Arrow indicates the energy where VTVH data were collected.
(b) VTVH data collected at 7570 cm–1 (pink points
with error bars) and the obtained doublet fit (solid line) (* is the
baseline due to the protein precipitation and is not affected by the
magnetic field, indicating it is not a metal centered transition).

VTVH MCD data taken at 7570 cm–1 (arrow in Figure a) were
analyzed using the methods (equations S1–S3)
in . The doublet
analysis gave ground-state parameters of g|| = 8 and δ0 = 3.0 cm–1 (Ms = ±2) and an excited-state energy of
∼6 cm–1, with g|| = 4 (Ms = ±1). The spin-Hamiltonian
analysis associated with these ground- and excited-state parameters
gave the ZFS parameters, −13 cm–1 &lt; D1 &lt; −10 cm–1 (E1/D1 = 0.3–0.33),
9 cm–1 &lt; D2 &lt;
11 cm–1 (E2/D2 = 0.2–0.25), and an exchange coupling
−1 cm–1 &lt; J &lt; 0 cm–1. It is noted that the J value is
determined to be small and negative, which is similar to that of the
WT enzyme and the D140H single variant. Based on proteins and model
studies, μ-1,3 carboxylate bridges generally show small negative J’s that are not necessarily additive (i.e., the
number of μ-1,3 carboxylate bridges does not determine the magnitude
of J). However, the data do show at least one μ-1,3
caboxylate bridge is present for all three active sites (WT and both
single variants), because μ-1,1 carboxylate and μ-H2O bridges both give small positive J values
and an μ-OH bridge would have strong antiferro-coupling (i.e.,
−J &gt; 10 cm–1).−

These VTVH MCD data were further correlated to a specific
Fe(II)
center, using the spin-projection model in , with the ZFS and J range obtained from
the spin-Hamiltonian analysis. From this fitting, it was determined
that the Fe(II) center associated with the 8400 cm–1 transition has a ZFS of −11.7 ± 0.8 cm–1 and E/D ≈ 0.33 (). The exchange coupling
was determined to be J ≈ −0.18 ±
0.15 cm–1, consistent with the results of fitting
the doublet model.

Q137E/D140H Double Variant
(reported as EEH
mutant in ref ())
From the above results, the D to H mutation perturbed one Fe, indicating
His binding to Fe2, and the Q to E mutation perturbed both irons,
indicating bridge formation between two iron centers. Based on the
above results, the double variant Q137E/D140H of ferritin should,
in principal, correlate to the cofactor site of D84E RNR, which has
the same ligand set. The CD, low-temperature (LT) CD, and MCD data
for this double variant are shown in Figure . Compared to WT ferritin, the MCD spectrum of the double variant
clearly shows the effect of His binding (MCD sign change for one iron
site, Figure b vs Figure ) and the LF transition energy slightly changed, which could
be associated with the bridge formation. The simultaneous Gaussian
fit for these spectra requires 4 LF transitions, at 4540, 8240, 9460,
and 11 100 cm–1. Thus, the two irons in the
active site are inequivalent. The band at 4540 cm–1 reflects a 5C Fe site (paired with 9460 cm–1 or
11 000 cm–1) or 4C (paired with 8240 cm–1). Based on these possible pairings, the biferrous
active site coordination in the double variant of ferritin is either
4C + 6C, or 5C + 5C (or 6C).

Spectra of the Q137E/D140H ferritin double variant:
CD (280 K)
spectra (top), low temperature CD (3K) spectra (middle), and MCD (1.8
K, 7T) spectra (bottom) of the biferrous active site in the Q137E/D140H
ferritin double variant. The experimental data are shown in the black
line and the Gaussian bands from simultaneous peak fit are shown in
color (overall fit, red; each peak, green, pink, orange, and purple).
Spectra require 4 LF transitions from two inequivalent irons.

VTVH MCD data were collected for
3 LF transitions at the energies
indicated by arrows in Figure a that minimize
overlap with other bands. The data and their fits are shown in Figure b–d and analyzed using the methods described
in  (equations S1–S3).
The doublet model gives ground-state parameters of g|| = 8 and δ0 = 4.6 cm–1 (i.e., an Ms = ±2 ground state)
with an excited state at ∼7 cm–1 with g|| = 4 (i.e., Ms = ±1). These parameters indicate that the two Fe(II) sites
have different signs of D and are both quite rhombic.
The spin-Hamiltonian analysis gives −15 cm–1 &lt; D1 &lt; −13 cm–1 (E1/D1 =
0.3–0.33), 12 cm–1 &lt; D2 &lt; 14 cm–1 (E2/D2 = 0.2–0.25), and −1
cm–1 &lt; J &lt; 0 cm–1. The J value indicates that the double variant
also has weak antiferromagnetic coupling between the two Fe(II) centers.
To pair the LF transitions and determine the coordination environment
of each Fe(II), the spin-projection fitting of the VTVH MCD data was
performed. Based on this analysis, the transitions at 4540 cm–1 and 9460 cm–1 are associated with
the iron site with D ≈ −14.9 ±
1.0 cm–1 and E/D ≈ 0.33 (), and the transition at 11 100 cm–1 is
associated with an iron site with D ≈ +13.6
± 0.8 cm–1 and E/D ≈ 0.2 ().
The exchange coupling is J ≈ −0.15
± 0.15 cm–1. The Fe(II) with LF transitions
at 4540 cm–1 and 9460 cm–1 is
5C, and the second Fe(II) with transitions at 8240 cm–1 and 11 000 cm–1 is either 5C or 6C, as
the LF splitting for that iron site (∼3000 cm–1) is in a range that can be consistent with both. The ground and
excited state parameters obtained for the single and double variants
are summarized and compared to those of WT ferritin in Table .

Discussion
The combination of CD, MCD, and VTVH MCD spectroscopies
has been
applied to the biferrous active site in the Q137E/D140H double variant
of M ferritin that converts the ligand set of the ferroxidase site
into one that is equivalent to the diiron cofactor site in D84E RNR.
However, this double variant site has a different geometric and electronic
structure compared to that of the cofactor site in D84E RNR that correlates
with its much decreased O2 reaction rate. The ferritin
double variant has 4 LF transitions, which are paired as shown in
Figure a, indicating that the two irons are
5C + 5C (or 6C), while the biferrous site in D84E RNR has 3 LF transitions,
which are paired as shown in Figure b, indicating
5C + 4C iron coordination. Therefore,
the coordination environment at the active sites of ferritin double
variant is more saturated than that of D84E RNR. This requires the
presence of at least one extra ligand in the double variant in ferritin
either from the terminal carboxylate or from water. If the active
site of the ferritin double variant did not have a water ligand, the
5C + 5C coordination would require that the two terminal carboxylates
have bidentate binding at both iron centers. In this case, only two
LF transitions from two similar ferrous centers would be observed,
as found for the resting Δ9D active
site (Figure c). However, the four LF transitions observed in the ferritin double
variant indicate that the two ferrous ions in the active site possess
inequivalent coordination environments. Therefore, with two bridging
carboxylates, if one iron has a terminal bidentate carboxylate then
the second would possess at least one water ligand.

Comparison of MCD spectra
and inferred active site structures of
the Q137E/D140H ferritin double variant, D84E RNR, and resting Δ9D: (a) MCD spectrum (top) and the active
site structure (5C + 5C, bottom) of the Q137E/D140H ferritin double
variant. Since Glu137 forms a second bridge, the water molecule on
Fe1 (Figure ) was replaced with the carboxylate
oxygen ligand. Due to the His140 ligand replacing Asp140, the water
molecule on Fe2 site is likely redirected relative to WT (Figure ), which could affect the O2 reactivity.
There could be additional water binding or a change in the carboxylate
binding mode (mono- vs bidentate E23 and E103); (b) D84E RNR, MCD
spectrum (top) and matching crystal structure of the active site in
D84E RNR (bottom), adapted and modified from refs ( and ); (c) Δ9D, MCD spectrum (top) and matching crystal structure of
the active site (bottom), adapted and modified from refs ( and ).

Additional water coordination to one of the irons in the
active
site of the ferritin double variant would explain the difference in
O2 reactivities between this double variant site and a
cofactor site as in D84E RNR. While it is possible to form the oxidized
ferric species by iron auto-oxidation, the fact that the iron oxidation
rate of this double variant (0.2 s–1) is still an
order of magnitude faster than auto-oxidation in the L subunit recombinant
ferritin (∼0.01 s–1), which has no functional
catalytic site,, indicates that the iron oxidation
observed in the double variant reflects the reaction of O2 with the biferrous active site, likely through a DFP intermediate.
The rate constants for the O2 reaction with the biferrous
site (through a DFP, k1) and the decay
of the DFP (k2) were estimated for the
double variant (eq ) and compared to those
of D84E RNR (Table ).Since a peroxo intermediate
was not observed in the double variant, the DFP formation rate should
be limiting, and the DFP rapidly decay (relative to k1) to form the differic–oxo(hydroxo) species. Therefore, k1 is calculated from the kinetic data in ref () based on the initial diferric–oxo(hydroxo)
formation rate (monitored ΔA350 nm), and the lower limit of k2 is estimated
by assuming that the DFP intermediate would not be observed when A650 nm &lt; 0.01. As shown in Table , the k1 for the rate
of the O2 reaction of the double variant is 2 orders of
magnitude slower than that of D84E RNR, while the lower limit of the k2 value is similar between the double variant
and D84E RNR. This decreased rate of DFP-formation could result from
the presence of an active site water ligand in the double variant
relative to D84E RNR, as it could block O2 binding or alter
the orientation of the redox active orbitals required for O2 bridging. Therefore, although the protein-derived ligands are the
same as those of a cofactor site, the presence of additional water
ligation in the double variant active site of ferritin limits its
ability to activate O2. Interestingly, WT ferritin, which
has a 5C + 5C active site, thus an additional ligand relative to the
D84E RNR cofactor site, has comparable DFP formation and decay rates
to D84E RNR (Table ). These rates suggest
that WT ferritin has the optimal orientation of the open coordination
positions on both Fe(II) to
allow O2 to react in the bridging mode required for 2e– reduction. Based on the
active site structure resulting from the spectroscopic studies in
ref () (Figure a), the orientations of the open coordination positions
in WT ferritin would derive from H-bonding of the coordinated water
to the Q137 and D140 ligands. These water ligands would also contribute
to the rapid DFP decay through proton donation to efficiently complete
the ferroxidase reaction.

and calculated (Q137E/D140H variant) from ref () (20 °C); k1 is calculated based on the initial diferric-oxo(hydroxo)
formation rate (Vi monitored
at ΔA350 nm) based on the assumption
that the DFP immediately decays to the diferric-oxo(hydroxo) species
as soon as formed. The lower limit of k2 is estimated by assuming that the DFP intermediate would not be
observed when A650 nm &lt; 0.01.

While the hydrophilic
environment of the active site, which provides
the additional water ligand in the double variant, is important in
limiting the O2 reaction rate, electrostatic and steric
effect must also be considered. Mutation of the ligands could change
the charge distribution (with no net charge change) around the active
site, thus affect the dioxygen accessibility. In addition, steric
effects, mostly caused by the mutation of the aliphatic chain into
a ring (D to H), could reduce the O2 reaction rate by blocking
access to the active site, as suggested in the previous kinetic studies. Because the dioxygen channel in ferritin is
not well-defined, we focus on the active site pocket in WT ferritin
and the double variant (WT ferritin obtained from crystal structure,
RCSB 1MFR, ref (); the double variant obtained by substituting the ligands from the
WT crystal structure (Q137 to E and D140 to H), optimizing this structure
with α-carbon position constraints using DFT, and placing the optimized structure into the protein active
site). The pocket volume of WT ferritin is calculated as ∼70–100
Å3 within 6 Å from the center of two irons. This
volume is reduced to ∼40–70 Å3 in the
double variant, which, however, is still large enough to bind both
water and dioxygen (total ∼30 Å3). Therefore,
the volume change in the active site pocket does not make a major
contribution to the slower O2 reaction rate of the double
variant. Alternatively, this mutation does change in the shape of
the active site pocket (Figure a vs b), which
could reduce O2 accessibility to the proper binding mode.
However, D84E RNR (obtained from crystal structure, RCSB 1PIZ, ref ()) has an even smaller active
site pocket (&lt;30 Å3) as shown in Figure c, yet shows a fast O2 reaction rate
(Table ) compared to that of the double variant.
This indicates that the dynamic properties of the protein can provide
flexibility at the active site for O2 binding. Therefore,
although electrostatic and steric effects could contribute to the
low k1 in eq ,
the additional water ligand present in the double variant is likely
the major contributor in limiting this O2 reaction.

indicated with darker colored spaces and blue dashed line. Mutation
in the active site changes the shape of the active site pocket, which
could limit the accessible orientation of dioxygen binding ((a) vs
(b)). However, the double variant has 10–40 Å more space
compared to the cofactor site in D84E RNR, which rapidly reacts with
O2 ((b) vs (c)).

To obtain insight into the origin of the water ligation difference
between the double variant of ferritin and D84E RNR, the overall protein
scaffolds and their water accessibilities were compared (Figure ). Even though both active sites share 4-helix bundle
structures, D84E RNR has additional protein segments surrounding its
4-helix bundle, while the 4-helix bundles in the ferritin subunits
are more exposed (Figure a). This difference
in protein scaffolds would isolate the active site in D84E RNR from
the solvent environment, relative to the active site in the double
variant (Figure b). In addition, hydrophilic
residues near the active site in ferritin could contribute to the
water access through a channel observed in the crystal structure (Figure ). (It was recently shown that that these hydrophilic
residues are important for Fe(II) transfer from the ion channel to
the active sites; R.K. Behera and E.C. Theil, in review).

of WT ferritin (RCSB 3RBC, ref ()) showing hydrophilic nature
near the active site. This structure was chosen because it has a diiron
active site, and this view was selected because ordered waters are
in a direction allowing a view of the metal site in Figure b.

Since ferritin has the task of rapidly collecting and storing
free
iron discharged from damaged iron proteins during oxidative stress, the ability to detect and remove iron from the
surroundings is an essential feature of its substrate site. Therefore,
ferritin active sites are optimized for iron substrate access, which
is consistent with the hydrophilic protein environment near the biferrous
site. Alternatively, the cofactor sites activate O2 for
reactions with substrate with a slower decay of the peroxo intermediate
that allows its control for enzymatic function. The hydrophobic environment
required in biferrous cofactor sites and the hydrophilic environment
required in diiron substrate sites are achieved through first and
second sphere contributions from the protein scaffold. Thus, the contributions
of iron ligands to protein catalytic activity can be sufficiently
modulated by the protein scaffold, to limit the ferritin double variant
in its cofactor reactivity with the O2.
