Peptidylglycine monooxygenase
catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of amidated peptides
that serve as important signaling molecules in numerous endocrine
pathways. Specifically, the enzyme hydroxylates
the α-C atom of the glycine-extended C-terminus of the propeptide
in a reaction involving the transfer of four electrons to O2, two from the C–H bond and two from an external reductant.
To conduct this conversion, the enzyme stores the external electrons
on a pair of copper atoms that are termed CuH and CuM [also denoted
H-site and M-site, respectively (Figure )]
that are reduced to the Cu(I) state by an external reductant, which
is ascorbate under physiological conditions. During turnover, oxygen
is believed to bind to Cu(I) at the M-center where it forms a Cu(II)–superoxo
species. This activated intermediate then abstracts a H-atom from
the α-CH entity of the nearby substrate to form peroxide and
a substrate radical. O–O bond cleavage coupled to radical rebound
generates a hydroxylated product and a high-valent species [Cu(III)–oxo
or Cu(II)–O•–] that is reduced to
the resting enzyme by a second electron transfer from H to M.

Structure of
the PHM active site taken from Protein Data Bank entry 1OPM. This figure shows
the H-site coordinated to the Nδ atom of H107, H108, and Nε
of H172, and the oxygen binding (catalytic) M-site coordinated to
Nε of H242 and H244 and the thiother S of M314. The side chain
of the conserved E313 is shown forming an H-bond to the main chain
amide nitrogen of H244. The bound substrate (diiodotyrosylglycine)
is colored green.

This mechanism has attracted
much attention because of a number
of unique attributes, many of which have been revealed by crystallography
(Figure ).− First, the copper centers are 11 Å apart, separated by a solvent-filled
cleft in the protein that imposes restrictions on intrasite electron
transfer.− It has been proposed that the physical separation prevents the second
electron from being transferred until after the enzyme has committed
to catalysis, thereby harnessing the strong electrophilic reactivity
of the Cu(II)–superoxo entity., Second, the
coordination chemistry at each copper is unusual. The M-site is coordinated
by H242, H244, and a weak interaction with the thioether of M314,− which nevertheless plays a critical role in catalysis, because mutation
to His, Cys, or Asp results in an ∼95% loss of activity., The H-site is bound by three coordinating His residues, H107, H108,
and H172,, mutation of any one of which also eliminates
&gt;95% of the catalytic activity. The H-site undergoes an unusual
conformational
change at low pH in which a Met residue (part of a H107H108M109 triad) coordinates to the copper and
shuts off activity. Furthermore, unlike
similar sites in other copper proteins, H does not appear to bind
exogenous ligands.

Understanding
the individual roles of the electron transfer (H)
and oxygen-activating (M) centers is key to unraveling the overall
catalytic mechanism. Much of the relevant chemistry, including the
template for the binding of oxygen at CuM and the state of CuH immediately
prior to ET, occurs in the Cu(I) state that is opaque to many traditional
spectroscopic methods because of its d10 configuration.
Available insight into the structure and reactivity of the Cu(I) forms
of PHM and its variants has been derived from X-ray absorption spectroscopy,
the one spectroscopic technique that can inform on the Cu(I) state,,,− but the analysis gives only a structural perspective
averaged over both copper centers. It is clearly important to obtain
site-specific structure–reactivity data for the H- and M-centers
individually, to assess the detailed role of each in the overall catalytic
process.

We have constructed and characterized two PHM variants
that when
metalated bind copper and silver at only a single center. The H242A
variant is an M-site deletion mutant that removes one of the two histidines
necessary for tight binding of copper to the M-site. In previous work, we showed that a similar deletion of one of
three histidines at the H-site was insufficient to abrogate copper
binding at this site. Accordingly, we constructed double mutant H107AH108A
in which removal of two of three histidines now prevents metal binding
at the H-center. Here we present a detailed study of each of these
single-site variants, in which we show that they do indeed report
the individual chemistry and spectroscopy of each site.

Materials and
Methods
Buffers and ascorbate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
at a minimal
purity of 99%. Beef liver catalase was acquired from Roche. Substrates
Ac-Tyr-Val-Gly (Ac-YVG) and dansyl-Tyr-Val-Gly (dansyl-YVG) were purchased
from Peptide International and American Peptide Co., respectively.

Construction
of Mutants
All variants were constructed
using the PHM catalytic core sequence (PHMcc) comprised of residues
42–356. The H107AH108A variant was constructed as previously
reported., H107AH108A was individually introduced into
pBS.ΔProPHM382s (obtained as a gift from B. A. Eipper and R.
E. Mains) using splicing by overlap extension (SOEing). Sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers
(Table S1 of the ) encoding ∼20 bases downstream and upstream of the mutation
were used for site-directed mutagenesis and paired with primers upstream
and downstream of two restriction enzyme sites, ClaI and XbaI. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) products were purified on agarose gels. Final
PCR products were extracted with phenol and chloroform, digested using
restriction enzymes (NEB), fractionated on agarose gels, purified
via a Qiagen PCR kit, and then ligated into the pCIS.2CXXNH expression
vector (also a gift from B. A. Eipper and R. E. Mains). Sequence analysis
was performed on mutant clones, and Qiagen midi prep was used to ensure
20 μg/20 μL of recombinant DNA for transfection.

Screening
PHMcc Single-Site Mutants
CHO DG44 cells
were transfected with the recombinant DNA using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). The transfected cells were subsequently selected for Dhfr cell lines in α-minimum Eagle’s medium
containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum., Only those cells that retained the Dhfr gene (colocated
with PHM on the plasmid) were capable of growth under these conditions.
Monoclonal cell lines were created by serial dilution into 96-well
plates, to select for wells that contained single-cell colonies. These
were passed individually into a fresh 96-well plate, grown to confluence,
and screened via Western blotting for PHMcc production under similar
conditions. The strongest producers were inoculated into a Hollow
Fiber Bioreactor with a MWCO of 5000 (Fibercell Systems, Inc.).

Western Blot Analysis
CHO DG44 cells were incubated
in DMEM/F12 medium containing 0.5% Fetal Clone II (FCII, Fisher) for
at least 24 h before a sample was collected. It was then mixed with
SDS and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Each sample was separated
by 8 to 25% SDS–PAGE and then transferred to an Immobilon P
membrane (Millipore) using the PhastSystem (Applied Biosciences).
PHM proteins were visualized using rabbit antibody 246 [rPAM(116–131)] diluted 1:1500 and secondary antibody anti-rabbit
IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:1000, followed by an AP Conjugate Substrate
kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

PHMcc Expression and Purification
Variant cell lines
H242A (kindly provided to us by R. E. Mains and B. A. Eipper) and
H107AH108A (constructed in house) were grown as described previously., Briefly, the stably transfected cell lines were thawed from a freezer
stock in a T75 flask with 20 mL of DMEM/F12 medium containing 10%
FCII serum (Fisher). At 80% confluence, the cells were passed into
five NUNC triple flasks (500 cm2 per flask) that were also
grown to confluence. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 50
mL of medium with 10% FCII serum prior to being inoculated into the
extra-capillary space (ECS) of a Hollow Fiber Bioreactor (Fibercell
Systems 4300-C2008, MWCO of 5000, 3000 cm2 surface area)
precultured first with 2 L of 50 mM PBS (pH 7.35) and then with 2
L of DMEM/F12 10% FCII serum.,,, Individual bioreactors containing
each of the variants were fed with DMEM/F12/10% FCII serum for a month,
after which the serum level was reduced to 0.5% FCII serum. At this point, the bioreactors were fed with
0.5% serum-containing medium every other day, and spent medium (20
mL) from the ECS was collected and frozen at −20 °C for
later purification. After being harvested in the bioreactor for a
month (300 mL), each variant was purified as previously described.

Reconstitution with Copper
Initially,
the single-site
variants were dialyzed against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0)
overnight and then reconstituted with up to 2 equiv of cupric sulfate
by slow addition (60 μL/h) followed by exhaustive dialysis.
This procedure led to copper:protein ratios close to 1. Thereafter,
the single-site mutants were reconstituted with 1.3 equiv of cupric
sulfate, dialyzed overnight against 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer,
concentrated using ultrafiltration, and passed through a desalting
spin column to remove any remaining unbound cupric ions. The protein
concentration was determined by OD280 on a Cary 50 UV–vis
spectrophotometer at room temperature using an absorbance at 280 nm
for a 0.1% solution (1 mg/mL in a 1 cm path length cell) of 0.980. The copper concentrations were determined using
a Perkin-Elmer Optima 2000 DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometer (ICPOES).

Reconstitution with Silver
All silver
reconstitutions
were conducted in a dark room, with the sample and the silver nitrate
stock solutions (100 mM) covered by aluminum foil. Variants were exhaustively
dialyzed against MES buffer (50 mM, pH 6.0) overnight, to exchange
residual phosphate and chloride ions present in the buffer used for
enzyme isolation. The protein was then reconstituted with 1.3 equiv
of a freshly prepared AgNO3 solution using a syringe pump
at a rate of 30 μL/h. The reconstituted protein was gently stirred
for 1 h and then passed through two MES buffer-equilibrated desalting
columns. The M109I variant was reconstituted with 2.5 equiv of freshly
prepared AgNO3 at a pump rate of 30 μL/h followed
by stirring for 1 h, and two cycles of desalting on MES buffer-equilibrated
spin columns. Protein concentrations were determined as described
for copper above. Silver concentrations were determined by ICPOES.

Activity Measurements
The enzymatic activities of H107AH108A
and H242A were measured by monitoring oxygen consumption in a Rank
Brothers oxygen electrode at 37 °C as previously reported. The reaction was performed in a water-jacketed
cell at 37 °C. The mixture (2 mL) contained 100 mM MES (pH 5.5),
200 μL of a 6 mg/mL catalase solution (∼50000 units),
a 5 μM copper sulfate solution, 10 mM ascorbate, and 80 μM
dansyl-YVG substrate. The reaction mixture was allowed to equilibrate
for several minutes, after which it was capped and a baseline was
measured for 50 s. The reaction was then initiated by adding 10–30
μL of enzyme, through the cap of the reaction vessel with a
50 μL Hamilton syringe. The enzyme concentration for mutants
was varied from 100 to 350 μM. Oxygen consumption was monitored
and analyzed as previously reported.,

Collection
and Analysis of EPR Spectra
Quantitative
X-band (9.4 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Elexsys E500
spectrometer equipped with a Bruker ER049X SuperX microwave bridge,
and an E27H lock-in detector. Temperature control was provided by
a continuous nitrogen flow cryostat system, in which the temperature
was monitored with a Bruker W1100321 thermocouple probe. Frozen Cu(II)
protein samples at concentrations between 100 and 500 μM in
50 mM MES buffer (pH 5.8, with no cryoprotectant) were measured in
4 mm silica tubes at 90–110 K under nonsaturating power conditions.
EPR spectra were simulated using SIMPIP, developed at the University
of Illinois (Urbana, IL) and described in detail elsewhere.

Sample Preparation for XAS
The oxidized
protein samples
were prepared in a single step by 5-fold dilution of enzyme at a concentration
of 4 mM in Cu(II) with either 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)
or 50 mM MES and 50 mM formic acid (pH 5.5 or 3.5), as necessary.
Ethylene glycol was added to a concentration of 20% of the total volume.
Reduced protein samples were prepared under anaerobic conditions by
5-fold dilution with pH-adjusted anaerobic buffers to which 5 mM ascorbate
had been added along with 20% ethylene glycol. Samples were transferred
to XAS cuvettes and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The final concentration
of copper or silver varied from 600 to 1200 μM.

Collection
and Analysis of XAS Data
Samples were measured
as aqueous glasses in 20% ethylene glycol at 10 K. Copper K-edge (8.9
keV) and Ag K-edge (25.5 KeV) extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data were
collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource operating
at 3 GeV with currents close to 500 mA maintained by continuous top-off.

Cu K-edges were measured on beamline 9-3 using a Si[220] monochromator
and a Rh-coated mirror upstream with a 12.5 keV energy cutoff to reject
harmonics. Data were collected in fluorescence mode using a high-count
rate Canberra 100-element Ge array detector with maximal count rates
per array element of &lt;120 kHz. A nickel oxide filter and Soller
slit assembly inserted in front of the detector was used to reduce
elastic scattering relative to the Cu Kα fluorescence. Four
to six scans of a sample containing only buffer were averaged and
subtracted from the averaged data for each protein sample to remove
the Ni Kβ fluorescence and produce a flat pre-edge baseline.

Ag K-edge data (25.5 KeV) were measured on beamline 7.3 using nitrogen-filled
ion chambers operating at 1.5 kV. The energy cutoff mirror (used for
harmonic rejection) was removed to achieve the high energy, and the
Si(220) monochromator was fully tuned to optimize incident counts.
While the setup did not provide for harmonic rejection, the level
of harmonic contamination at this energy was expected to be low. Energy
calibration was achieved with a Ag foil placed between the second
and third ionization chambers. The EXAFS was detected by Ag Kα
fluorescence using a Canberra 30-element detector with count rates
kept below 120 Hz per channel to avoid saturation. Soller slits and
a Pd foil were used to attenuate the elastic scatter peak. Four to
six scans of a sample containing only buffer were averaged and subtracted
from the averaged data for each protein sample to remove the Pd Kβ
fluorescence and produce a flat pre-edge baseline.

Data reduction
and background subtractions were performed using
the program modules of EXAFSPAK. Output
from each detector channel was inspected for glitches and dropouts
before inclusion in the final average. Spectral simulation was conducted
using EXCURVE version 9.2− as described previously. Simulations of the EXAFS data used a mixed-shell
model consisting of imidazole from histidine residues and S from methionine
coordination. The threshold energy, E0, was set at 8985 eV for Cu and 25520 eV for Ag. Refinement of structural
parameters included distances (R), coordination numbers
(N), and Debye–Waller factors (2σ2) and included multiple scattering contributions from outer-shell
atoms of imidazole rings and from linear CO groups.

CO Binding
Purified WT PHMcc, H107AH108A, and H242A
were concentrated to approximately 4 mM Cu in 20 mM phosphate (pH
8.0). The pH was then adjusted by diluting the concentrated enzyme
four times with 50 mM MES/HEPES/CHES/formate mixed buffer at pH 3.5
or 7.5 in a septum-sealed conical vial. Samples were purged under
a gentle stream of CO gas for 5 min before the addition of a 5-fold
excess (5 mM) of anaerobic buffered ascorbate and then incubated under
an atmosphere of pure CO for an additional 5 min.

Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy
After reaction
with CO, protein solutions were loaded into the IR cell (50 μm
path length) at a final concentration of 1 mM in copper. After the
protein data had been collected, the cell was flushed with buffer
and a baseline was recorded. FTIR data were recorded on a Bruker Tensor
27 FTIR spectrometer at room temperature with a sample chamber that
was continuously purged with dry CO2-free air. Samples
were equilibrated inside the instrument sample chamber for 15 min
to allow purging of water vapor and CO2 prior to data collection.
One thousand scans were collected for each sample and buffer spectrum
from 2200 to 1950 cm–1 at a nominal resolution of
2 cm–1. Baseline subtraction and spectral analysis
were performed using the GRAMS AI Spectroscopy Software (Thermo).

Results and Discussion
Copper Binding Stoichiometry and Catalytic
Activity
Each of the two single-site variants was tested
for its capacity
to bind copper. Apoproteins were incubated with up to 2 equiv of cupric
sulfate added slowly by syringe pump, followed by exhaustive dialysis
or desalting on at least two spin columns. For H242A, the stoichiometry
of Cu(II) binding was 1.11 ± 0.03 (average of five measurements),
while for H107AH108A, the stoichiometry was 1.09 ± 0.15 (average
of six measurements). The catalytic activity of each variant was measured
using the standard assay of oxygen uptake on an oxygen sensitive electrode
where the slope of the O2 concentration versus time plot
is a direct measure of enzyme activity. Reactants (excluding the enzyme)
were incubated together for several minutes prior to initiation by
the enzyme. The slope of the oxygen concentration versus time curve
did not change after initiation, even at high protein concentrations
(up to 350 μM). This is in marked contrast to the case for the
WT enzyme, which gives slopes approaching the diffusion limit of oxygen
across the electrode membrane at enzyme concentrations of ≤30
μM. We conclude that neither variant has measurable catalytic
activity, consistent with the hypothesis that each represents a single-site
mutant, where the absence of the second copper atom completely abrogates
catalytic activity.

Structural Properties of the Cu(II) Proteins
XAS and
EPR spectra were recorded on the oxidized forms of H107AH108A and
H242A variants to provide spectroscopic evidence of their formulation
as single-site derivatives. Previous EXAFS data for the cupric form
of the WT protein were consistent with ligand sets of (His)3(OH2) and (His)2(OH2)2 for H and M, respectively, where the S(Met) interaction at M is
undetectable., Also, EXAFS spectra of the oxidized
forms of metal site His to Ala mutants such as H107A, H108A, and M314H were
found to be extremely similar to those of WT and to each other, because
the ligand sets differ by an average of 0.5 His ligand per copper.
In the present case, the expectation is that single-site H and M spectra
should likewise be similar, a prediction borne out by the nearly identical
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) (Figure a) of the two variants. Although the H-center should have
one more histidine per Cu(II), the overall two-site equatorial coordination
is consistently 4N/O. Any EXAFS difference should then be manifest
only in the outer-shell signatures of imidazole ligation in the Fourier
transforms (FT) around 3 and 4 Å, respectively. Figure a compares the FTs of H242A and H107AH108A variants.
In line with prediction, the intensity of the first shell is very
similar, while a significant increase in the outer-shell amplitude
is observed for the H242A H single site. Panels b and c of Figure  show simulations of the M-site [2N(His) + 2O(solvent)]
and H-site [3N(His) + 1O(solvent)], respectively, with their metrical
parameters listed in Table . The fits were
obtained by constraining the Debye–Waller (DW) factors for
the outer-shell imidazole atoms to be the same in each fit, while
allowing the imidazole occupation number to increase from 2 (M-site)
to 3 (H-site). The excellent agreement between theory and experiment
for the outer-shell features is convincing evidence of the predicted
ligand sets of H- and M-sites, respectively.

Coordination numbers are generally
considered accurate to ±25%.

In any one fit, the statistical
error in bond lengths is ±0.005 Å. However, when errors
due to imperfect background subtraction, phase shift calculations,
and noise in the data are compounded, the actual error is closer to
±0.02 Å.

Fits
modeled histidine coordination
by an imidazole ring, which included single and multiple scattering
contributions from the second-shell (C2/C5) and third-shell (C3/N4)

Cu–N–C3, −126°; Cu–N–N4, 163°;
Cu–N–C5, −163°.

Distances of the Cu–N(His)

fits to the oxidized proteins.

Figure  compares EPR spectra for the H242A
and H107AH108A variants. The spectra show significant differences
in the parallel region (Figure a), while simulations
(Table  and Figure b,c) show that the origin of these differences is largely the difference
in the value of g∥ with the H-site
single variant (H242A) having a lower value than the M-site single
variant (H107AH108A). This is expected on the basis of Peisach–Blumberg
correlations that predict that sites with more N donors have lower
values of g∥. The effect of adding together the spectra of the two variants
in equal (0.5) proportions and comparing the sum with the spectrum
of the WT protein is shown in Figure d. The
composite spectrum is a reasonable match to that of the WT protein
as predicted if the EPR spectra of the individual sites are additive
and the sites do not interact. The residual after subtraction of the
composite spectrum from the WT is shown in Figure e, where the lack of any broad underlying signal again suggests
that the two sites do not interact or that any interaction cannot
be detected at the temperature of the measurement (170 K). On the
other hand, the g and A values of
the single-site variants correlate less well with the two-site simulation
of the WT spectrum reported earlier and included in Table  for comparison. It
is unclear whether this discrepancy relates to inadequacies in the
two-site fitting model or to perturbations in the single-site variants
relative to the WT protein, but the good correspondence between WT
and the 50:50 composite spectrum suggests the former. The bottom panel
of Figure  shows expanded views of the parallel
region for the spectra shown in parts a, d, and e of Figure .

Structural Properties of the Cu(I) Centers
The Cu(I)
forms of the single-site variants were prepared by ascorbate reduction
of their cupric forms. The structures and chemistry of the reduced
sites are distinct and offer a more sensitive basis for assessing
the fidelity of the single-site variants with respect to the native
protein. Previous studies of WT PHM and a variety of H- and M-site
variants have provided working assignments for spectral signatures
characteristic of the H- and M-site Cu(I) centers. For example, on
the basis of EXAFS and FTIR of unligated variants and their CO complexes
conducted as a function of pH, CuH(I) was predicted to
be coordinated to two or three His residues at pH &gt;6 in a configuration
that did not bind CO, whereas a conformational switch to a His + S(Met)
form was observed at pH &lt;6, which now bound CO with a ν(C≡O)
of 2110 cm–1. CuM(I) was coordinated
by two His residues and a weakly bound S(Met) and bound CO at all
pH values with a ν(C≡O) of 2092 cm–1. All of these systems bound copper at both sites., Therefore,
while the spectral assignments were generally consistent with the
available data, the uncertainties introduced by the presence of two
chemically inequivalent Cu(I) centers led to ambiguity.

Figure b shows X-ray absorption edge data for the reduced
H242A (H-site) variant at pH 7.5 (red) and pH 3.5 (blue). The absorption
edges show significant differences. At pH 7.5, a relatively intense
feature is observed at 8983.7 eV indicative of low-coordinate Cu(I)–bis-imidazole
complexes− and suggesting that at neutral pH the H-center binds
only two of the three available histidine ligands. Analysis of the
EXAFS (Figure , top panel) confirms this conclusion
where the metrical environment simulates to two imidazole ligands
with a characteristically short Cu–N(imid) distance of 1.89
Å (Table )., These data present the intriguing result that one of the three His
ligands is dissociated at neutral pH and imply that a significant
conformational change occurs upon reduction. At a low pH (3.5), a
different coordination is observed, depicted by a decrease in the
8983 eV intensity (Figure b, blue trace),
and the attenuation of the Cu–N peak and the appearance of
a new Cu–S interaction at ∼2.3 Å in the Fourier
transform (Figure , bottom panel). These changes
are similar to those reported earlier for the WT enzyme, absent in
the M109A variant, and interpreted as a conformational switch induced
by a protonation event that allows the noncoordinating M109 to flip
into a coordinating position. The Cu–S
and Cu–N distances (Table ) are now
typical of three coordination, implying that the Cu(I) retains two
His residues, but the Cu–N DW factor has increased, suggesting
more disorder in the Cu(I)–histidine diad. The data do not
indicate whether the protonating species is a H107 as previously suggested, but the following scenario could account for
the data. At neutral pH, the WT CuH binds H107 and H108 in a linear
configuration with H172 dissociated; when the pH is lowered, H107
is protonated and induces a conformational change to a form involving
a triad of H108, H172, and M109.

and pH 3.5 (bottom). Parameters used in the fits are listed in Table .

The DW value derived
via simulation of the low-pH data using an
N2S ligand set requires comment. The DW is nearly twice
that observed for the low-pH form of the WT protein, where contributions
from both the H- and M-centers are averaged. As discussed above, our
model for the low-pH transition at the H-center in WT PHM involves protonation of one of the coordinating
His residues, and replacement with the S ligand of the nearby M109
residue. Because the H-center single-site variant appears to coordinate
only two His residues at neutral pH, it is reasonable to ask whether
the high DW reflects the fact that the low-pH form of the H242A variant
is two- rather than three-coordinate, resulting from the protonation
and replacement of one of these with M109. However, from simulations,
neither the goodness of fit nor the values of the bond lengths support
a two-coordinate structure, with the Cu–S distance well-defined
at its three-coordinate value of 2.25 Å. We may conclude that
the high DW must arise from an increased level of disorder in the
site, perhaps as a result of multiple species present at equilibrium.
One possibility is that the pKa for the
protonation event in the variant may be lower than its WT value (4.6), leading to only partial conversion between the
Met-off and Met-on forms. Alternatively, more than one His residue
may be protonated, resulting in more complex speciation with fluxional
Cu–His coordination. Thus, the ligand dynamics of the low-pH
Cu(I)–N2S site of the H-center [strong Cu–S(Met)
with disordered Cu–His coordination] appear to be different
from those of the M-center (vide infra) where the
reverse appears to be true.

XAS data were also collected on
the H107AH108A (M-site) variant
and are shown in Figures c (edge data at pH
7.5 and 3.5) and  (EXAFS data at pH 7.5, 5.5,
and 3.5). Absorption edges are generally typical of three-coordinate
species. EXAFS analysis (Table ) indicates
the presence of two imidazole ligands and one methionine ligand as
expected for the His2Met ligand set with distances typical
of this coordination environment. The surprising feature of these
spectra is the variation in the intensity of the Cu–S(Met)
interaction as the pH is lowered, where the simulations show a significant
increase in DW factor with an increase in pH. One explanation of this
behavior is that the M-center is comprised of two different conformers,
a Met-on form (low pH) and a Met-off form (neutral pH) interconverting
via a deprotonation event. The observed distances appear to validate
this hypothesis. At neutral pH, both the Cu–N and Cu–S
distances are short and suggestive of two coordination; therefore,
it is reasonable to posit that the site is fluxional and interconverts
between His-His and His-Met ligand pairs. At low pH, the distances
become longer and become more characteristic of three coordination,
with a marked decrease in the DW factor of the Cu–S(Met) interaction.
We hypothesize that protonation of a noncoordinating residue removes
some constraint on the configuration of the three copper-binding residues,
allowing them to relax to a more stable conformational state.

for reduced Cu(I) forms of the M-site variant (H107AH108A) at pH 7.5
(top), 5.5 (middle), and 3.5 (bottom). Parameters used in the fits
are listed in Table .

The fluxional model predicts that an equivalent fit should
be obtained
using parameters that represent the average of the two interconverting
conformers. We tested this prediction for both neutral and low-pH
states using a model that allowed Cu–N and Cu–S shell
occupancies to vary while keeping the overall coordination number
fixed at 2. At pH 7, an adequate fit (F = 0.38 vs
0.26) could be obtained with 1.45 Cu–N(His) and 0.55 Cu–S(Met)
at the same distances but with lower DW factors (Figure S1 of the , top panel). At low pH,
however, simple averaging resulted in poorer simulations, but introduction
of a substoichiometric Cu–N interaction at 1.87 Å led
to a much improved fit (0.28 vs 0.47), particularly with respect to
the low-R shoulder in Figure  (bottom panel) and with more reasonable DW factors of the Cu–N
shells (Figure S1 of the , bottom panel). This may suggest the presence of both two-coordinate
and three-coordinate conformers existing in equilibrium at low pH
arising from more complex ligand dynamics.

Examination of the
crystal structure suggests a plausible explanation
for this behavior. The distance between the main chain amide N of
the M-coordinating H244 and one of the carboxylate oxygens of E313
is 2.78 Å, which is in the range expected for a H-bond between
these residues. E313 is part of the fully conserved E313M314C315 triad. We note that protonation of
the carboxylate side chain of E313 would sever this H-bond and remove
the constraint on the position and conformation of H244 as well any
constraint on E313’s neighbor, the M314 copper ligand. The
pH dependence of M-site S(met) coordination was not detected in our
previous pH-dependent study of the WT protein, largely because it was obscured by or averaged into the
pH-dependent conformational switch at the H-center, and it is therefore
unclear whether the M-site undergoes the same pH-dependent change
in the WT protein.

CO Complexes
We also investigated
the CO binding properties
of both single-site variants as a function of pH, using FTIR and XAS.
Panels a and b of Figure  compare the FTIR
in the 2200–1950 cm–1 region for the CO complexes
of H242A (H-site) at pH 7.5 and 3.5. On the basis of previous assignments
derived from measurements of the WT and M109A derivatives, an H-site
single-site variant is predicted to bind no CO at neutral pH but forms
a CO complex at low pH where the S donor atom from M109 enters the
coordination sphere. In line with these
predictions, no ν(CO) is observed at pH 7.5, whereas a rather
weak band centered at 2102 cm–1 is found at pH 3.5,
blue-shifted relative to that of the WT protein by ∼8 cm–1. The carbon–oxygen stretching frequency of
Cu(I)–carbonyl complexes is a sensitive index of coordination
and/or ligand conformation. ν(C≡O) is a measure of the
C–O bond order, which is modulated by the degree of back-bonding
from the filled d shell of Cu(I) into the empty π-antibonding
orbitals on CO, and is further influenced by the donor power of the
other ligands to Cu(I). These trends are illustrated by the frequency
of carbonmonoxy hemocyanin [Cu(His)3, 2043–2063
cm–1] relative to PHM and DBM [Cu(His)2(Met), 2089–2093 cm–1], where substitution
of the stronger histidine donor for the weaker thioether results in
less back-bonding and a higher frequency for PHM/DBM.,, However, CO frequencies are also
highly sensitive to metal site electronic structure, conformational
state, and site polarity. In Thermus thermophilus, ν(C≡O) for the CuB–CO photoproduct
of the caa3 oxidase is 10 cm–1 higher than that of the ba3 CuB–CO photoproduct, even though the ligand set consists of three
His residues in both cases,, which indicates at
least two conformations in the Fea3–CuB active site cavity. PHM and DBM likewise
share identical ligand sets at CuM, but their ν(C≡O)
values differ by 3 cm–1; CO frequencies of hemocyanins
from different species vary between 2043 and 2063 cm–1. The 8 cm–1 shift
in ν(CO) for the H242A variant is therefore not inconsistent
with the Cu(His)2S(Met)CO coordination proposed for the
low-pH CO complex of the H-center in the WT protein, but the His-Met
donor power, ligand conformation, or the site polarity must be different
in the H single-site variant. It is also unclear why the intensity
of the low-pH band is so much lower than that of the WT protein.

FTIR spectra
of single-site Cu(I)–CO complexes: (a) H-site
CO at pH 7.5, (b) H-site CO at pH 3.5, (c) M-site CO at pH 7.5, and
(d) M-site CO at pH 3.5.

Panels c and d of Figure  compare
the CO
complexes of the H107AH108A (M-site) variant at pH 7.5 and 3.5. Both
spectra show the intense 2092 cm–1 band previously
assigned to the M-site carbonyl. These data provide an unambiguous
assignment of the origin of this IR band. The arguments in the preceding
paragraph relating small changes in ν(C≡O) to conformational
variation among complexes of the same ligand set have a converse,
namely, that invariant frequencies are indicators of highly similar
coordination and conformation. The invariant ν(C≡O) of
WT and H107AH108A carbonyls therefore establishes that the ligand
set and conformation of the carbonyl are identical in WT and the M
single-site variant. The low-pH spectrum also shows a small shoulder
at 2111 cm–1. This feature could be due to a small
component of a different conformation because bands at a similar frequency
(with a much higher intensity) were observed previously for a low-pH
H-site CO complex of the WT enzyme, which was shown to have a similar
ligand set due to low-pH-induced flipping of M109 (vide supra). However, the structural differences
between conformers and the factors that control their distribution
are unknown at this time.

XAS was used to compare the structures
of the H- and M-site carbonyls
as shown in Figures d (XANES) and a,b (EXAFS). Metrical parameters, including those
of the coordinated CO derived from multiple scattering analysis, are
listed in Table . The two carbonyls appear
to be extremely similar with Cu–C and Cu–O distances
of 1.80 and 2.85 Å and Cu–C–O angles of 171°
and 179° for the H- and M-site complexes, respectively. From
these values (and assuming errors in bond lengths of ±0.02 Å
and angles of ±10°), the C–O bond distances calculate
out as 1.05 ± 0.08 Å, which is consistent with the expected
C–O distance of a coordinated carbonyl of ∼1.1 Å.
Other details of the complexes reveal essentially identical ligand
sets of two His residues, one S, and one CO, all with comparable and
chemically reasonable distances and Debye–Waller factors. These
structures are consistent with our predictions based on previous studies
of the WT and its CO complexes. However, the M-site CO EXAFS data
measured at pH 7.5 are of further interest because they establish
that the Met ligand is fully coordinated to Cu(I) in the carbonyl
(fully Met-on), even though M314 exists in Met-on and Met-off conformations
in the unligated M-site at neutral pH. In this regard, the M-site
CO structure corresponds to the Met-on conformation of the unligated
M-site at pH 3.5, suggesting that CO binding provides a greater driving
force than H-bonding (vide supra) in M-site conformational
organization. This observation also rationalizes the invariant 2092
cm–1 frequency of the M–CO complex over the
full pH range.

Coordination numbers are generally
considered accurate to ±25%.

In any one fit, the statistical
error in bond lengths is ±0.005 Å. However, when errors
due to imperfect background subtraction, phase shift calculations,
and noise in the data are compounded, the actual error is closer to
±0.02 Å.

Fits
modeled histidine coordination
by an imidazole ring, which included single and multiple scattering
contributions from the second-shell (C2/C5) and third-shell (C3/N4)
atoms, respectively. The Cu–N–Cx angles were as follows: Cu–N–C2, 126°;
Cu–N–C3, −126°; Cu–N–N4, 163°;
Cu–N–C5, −163°.

Metrical parameters for the CO ligand
were simulated using full multiple scattering treatment. Cu–C
and Cu–O distances and Cu–C–O angles were allowed
to float in the fits.

in the fits are listed in Table .

Silver Binding
We used single-site
mutant H107AH108A
to test whether other metals such as Ag(I) could bind at the M-center.
When the M-site variant was reacted with an excess (1.3) of molar
equivalents of silver nitrate in MES buffer (pH 6.0), followed by
two rounds of desalting on MES buffer-equilibrated spin columns, the
protein bound 1.06 ± 0.15 Ag(I) per protein, indicating tight
binding of silver. This result was then used to examine whether the
WT protein would similarly bind silver and whether the binding was
selective for the M-site. Ag(I) is electronically homologous to Cu(I)
and in general shows similar coordination chemistry, although Ag is expected to have a higher affinity for ligand
sets with S donors. Therefore, we used the M109I variant of the WT
protein to control against M109 flipping that occurs at low pH and
could influence Ag(I) binding at the H-center. The M109I variant (containing
intact M- and H-sites) was incubated with 2.3 equiv of silver nitrate
followed by two desalting steps and the silver content measured by
ICPOES. The protein was found to bind 0.84 ± 0.11 Ag(I) per protein.
Taken together, the results of these experiments imply that Ag(I)
binds selectively at the M-center and has little or no affinity for
the H-center. [Note that the analogous experiment of reacting Ag(I)
with the H-site variant H242A was deemed unreliable as deletion of
a single histidine may not be sufficient to abrogate binding of silver
to the remaining His and Met at the M-site.]

The ligand environments
of the silver complexes of H107AH108A and M109I were investigated
by EXAFS measurements at the silver absorption edge. The high energy
of the Ag K-edge makes these experiments challenging because of the
low intensity and beam heterogeneity at the large monochromator angles
necessary to reach the required energy (25.5 keV). These factors restricted
the usable k range of the data to ≤11 Å–1. EXAFS data for the M109I variant are shown in Figure . Simulation of the data requires the presence of
both Ag–N and Ag–S components, but because both components
have very similar phases, they are correlated given the restricted
data range in k space. Notwithstanding, a good fit
was obtained with one Ag–N(His) component at 2.2 Å and
one Ag–S component at 2.5 Å, although alternatives of
similar quality could be obtained varying the N- and S-shell occupancies
but keeping their sum equal to 2. These results are similar to those
obtained for the Cu(I) complex of H107AH108A at neutral pH and validate
the conclusion that silver binds exclusively at the M-center. EXAFS
data for the Ag(I) complex of H107AH108A were of poorer quality (data
not shown) but could be simulated by a N + S ligand set. However,
the poorer data coupled to the correlation discussed above led to
large uncertainties in both distances and coordination numbers, and
the simulations are considered unreliable.

Experimental and simulated
Fourier transform and EXAFS (inset)
for the 1:1 Ag(I) complex of the M109I derivative of WT PHM. Data
were collected at the Ag K-edge (25515 eV) and simulated with one
Ag–N(His) component at 2.18 Å and one Ag–S component
at 2.47 Å. Calculations included multiple scattering contributions
from the histidine ligand using geometric parameters as listed for
the copper EXAFS spectra in Table .

Conclusions
We
have prepared and characterized two variants of PHM that contain
mutations in the metal binding ligands at each of the two Cu centers.
These derivatives bind only a single copper atom, suggesting that
they indeed correspond to enzyme states with each of the two copper
sites singly occupied. The variants are completely devoid of catalytic
activity, emphasizing the obligatory requirement for both copper centers
in the catalytic mechanism. The H242A variant contains copper only
in the H-center, while the H107AH108A variant contains copper only
in the M-center.

Detailed spectroscopic studies of the Cu(II)
and Cu(I) forms of
these derivatives provide robust assignments for spectral features
previously observed in the WT protein. In particular, the unique chemistry
of the M-center, including its His2S(Met) ligation, and
reactivity toward CO generating a carbonyl complex with ν(CO)=2092
cm–1 are faithfully reproduced in the H107AH108A
variant. Likewise, the low-pH conformational switch described previously
for the H-center is also observed in
the H242A variant. However, the study also uncovers new structural
elements of both sites in the cuprous forms, which were previously
obscured by spectral overlap between the two inequivalent coppers
of the WT protein. For example, the H-center coordinates only two
of its three His ligands in the Cu(I) state, while the M-site appears
to undergo interesting pH-dependent conformational dynamics between
Met-on (low-pH) and Met-off (neutral pH) forms. These new observations
provide unique and critical insight into the catalytic roles of each
copper center.

Ag(I) is iso-electronic with Cu(I) and has been
shown to be handled
by similar cellular transport processes. Although complexes of Ag in the Ag(III) state exists, the instability
of the Ag(II) state renders the metal unsuitable for a functional
substitute for copper in enzymes such as PHM and DBM. However, substitution
of one of the metal centers with Ag(I) would create heterobimetallic
complexes in which the spectroscopy of the two centers does not overlap,
allowing the structural elements of each site to be studied independently.
Such studies would be a useful adjunct to single-site variants, as
the effect of M-site metal occupancy on the structure of the H-site
(and vice versa) could be distinguished. With this in mind, we used
the H107AH108A variant to find conditions under which the Ag(I) ion
could be incorporated at the PHM center and followed up with studies
of Ag(I) with a WT analogue that showed that Ag(I) bound selectively
at the M-center to generate a complex that gave structural (EXAFS)
parameters similar to those of the Cu(I) complex. These data open
the door to further investigations of the individual chemistry and
spectroscopy of the metal centers in PHM. Although more challenging,
the preparation of Ag/Cu heterobimetallic complexes is underway, and
their detailed analysis will be the subject of future studies from
this laboratory.
