The number of sequences in the
UniProtKB/TrEMBL and UniProtKB/SwissProt databases is increasing exponentially,
with &gt;54 million nonredundant entries as of March 2014 (Release
2014_03). However, the functions of less than 1% of these proteins
have been experimentally characterized (UniProtKB/SwissProt). Most
of the annotations in the sequence databases are based on automated
methods that transfer the function from the “closest”
homologue; however, this procedure is unreliable. Given the number of proteins with unknown functions, conducting
biochemical and genetic experiments for each protein individually
is unrealistic.,

Characterization of an in vitro activity has been considered to be sufficient to
assign biological function to an uncharacterized (unknown) enzyme.
However, with the recognition that enzymes often are promiscuous in vitro and that this promiscuity may be irrelevant in vivo, in vivo evidence is necessary
to confirm the in vitro activity as well as establish
the in vivo metabolic/physiological function. For
enzymes that function in metabolic pathways, characterization of the
pathway in which the enzyme participates facilitates the assignment
of both the correct in vitro activity as well as
the physiological role of the enzyme.

This laboratory has been
interested in understanding the structural basis for divergent evolution
of function in the enolase superfamily, with the name reflecting the
most abundant member of the superfamily. Functional assignment in
the enolase superfamily provides a paradigm for the challenges faced
in assigning functions to unknown enzymes discovered in genome projects:
sequence homology alone is insufficient to transfer functional annotations
from previously characterized members. For example, the majority of
members of the mandelate racemase (MR) subgroup within the enolase
superfamily catalyze the dehydration of acid sugars in catabolic pathways,, although the substrate specificities of these are unknown.

Members of the enolase superfamily share two conserved characteristics:
an initial partial reaction and a structural scaffold. To date, all
characterized members catalyze functionally diverse reactions initiated
by abstraction of the proton of a carbon located α to a carboxylate
group to form an enolate anion intermediate. For the proton abstraction
to be kinetically competent, the intermediate is stabilized by coordination
to a required Mg2+ ion. The intermediate then can undergo
different fates such as the elimination of water or ammonia, cycloisomerization,
epimerization, or racemization.

Also, all structurally characterized members contain an N-terminal
(α + β) capping domain that determines the substrate specificity
and a C-terminal (β/α)7β-barrel domain
(a modified TIM-barrel domain) that contains the residues required
for catalysis. The active site is located at the interface between
the capping and barrel domains. The barrel domain contains three carboxylate
ligands for the required Mg2+ located at the ends of third,
fourth, and fifth β-strands and conserved acid/base catalysts
located at the C-terminal ends of the second, sixth, and/or seventh
β-strands. The identities and positions
of these catalytic residues provide the ability to catalyze different
reactions using the same structural scaffold. The identities and locations
of the metal ion binding ligands and acid/base catalysts allows the
superfamily to be partitioned into seven subgroups. The conserved
metal binding and catalytic residues of the subgroups are presented
in , Table 1. The
MR subgroup is one of the largest subgroups, with a conserved His-Asp
dyad located at the ends of the seventh and sixth β-strands
functioning as an acid/base catalyst.

In this article, we report
the l-lyxonate dehydratase (LyxD) function, a novel in vitro activity for a previously uncharacterized member
of the MR subgroup, and the pathway in which LyxD participates to
allow l-lyxonate to be used as a carbon source.

Materials and
Methods
Screen for Dehydration Activity
Enzymes were screened
for acid sugar dehydration activity with a library of 77 mono- and
di-acid sugars using the semicarbazide assay. The reaction solutions contained 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 5 mM
MgCl2, 1 mM acid sugar, and 1 μM enzyme. The reactions
(50 μL) were performed in Corning 96-well UV-transparent plates
and were incubated at 30 °C for 16 h. A 250 μL aliquot
of a 1% semicarbazide solution in 1% sodium acetate was added; after
incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the absorbance was measured
at 250 nm with a TECAN microplate reader (ε = 10,200 cm–1 M–1).

Kinetic Assays of l-Lyxonate Pathway Enzymes
LyxD activity was quantitated
using a continuous enzyme-coupled spectroscopic assay. The 200 μL
mixture reaction contained 20 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.16 mM NAD+, 0.025 mM to 1 mM l-lyxonate,
3 μM 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-lyxonate dehydratase (L-Kdl dehydratase),
3 μM α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (αKGSDH),
and 21 nM LyxD. The reduction of NAD+ was monitored by
the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (ε = 6220 M–1 cm–1) with a PerkinElmer Lambda-14 UV–vis
spectrophotometer.

Assays for the two pathway proteins L-Kdl
dehydratase and αKGSDH were similarly performed: the 200 μL
mixture reaction contained 20 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.16 mM NAD+, 0.025 mM to 1 mM l-lyxonate,
and 3 μM l-lyxonate dehydratase. However, for the L-Kdl
dehydratase assay 3 μM αKGSDH and 21 nM L-Kdl dehydratase
were added, and the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm was measured.
For the αKGSDH assay, 21 nM αKGSDH and 3 μM L-Kdl
dehydratase were added. These conditions provided a limiting amount
of the assayed enzyme and an excess amount of the coupling enzyme
in the reactions.

Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification
The genes encoding L-Kdl dehydratase (UniProt ID Q9I1Q1) and αKGSDH
(UniProt ID Q9I1Q0) were PCR-amplified from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 ATCC 47085 genomic DNA. The 100 μL reactions contained
1 ng of DNA, 20 μL of 5× Phusion HF buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP,
1 μL of NEB Phusion enzyme, and 40 pmol primers complementary
to the beginning and end of the genes containing desired restriction
enzyme sites and used a PTC-200 Gradient thermocycler. The digested
PCR products were ligated into the pET-15b vector linearized with
the same restriction enzymes. The ligation product was transformed
in XL1Blue electrocompetent cells.

The proteins were expressed
in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with expression
plasmids grown at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/mL ampicillin
until OD600 = 0.5, at which point the cells were induced
by the addition of 1 mM IPTG; growth was continued overnight. The
cells were harvested by centrifugation (15 min at 4500g), resuspended in binding buffer (5 mM imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, and 20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9), lysed by sonication,
and clarified by centrifugation. The lysate containing the His-tagged
protein was loaded on a 5 mL HisTrap FF crude column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with binding buffer and eluted with a linear 80 mL gradient
from 0% to 100% of elution buffer (1 M imidazole, 0.5 M NaCl, and
20 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.9).

The expression αKGSDH yielded
soluble His-tagged protein, which was purified by a Ni2+ column as mentioned above. L-Kdl dehydratase was not soluble with
the His-tag; however, it was soluble when purified using the pMAL-c2X
plasmid containing maltose binding protein (MBP-Tag). The protein
was loaded on MBP Trap HP (GE Healthcare) and eluted with MBP elution
buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, and 10 mM maltose).

The gene encoding the LyxD from Labrenzia aggregata IAM 12614 (UniProt ID A0NP48) was cloned into expression vector
pNIC28-BSA4 by PCR and the ligation-independent cloning method as
previously described. The resulting plasmid
was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli containing
the pRIL plasmid (Stratagene) and used to inoculate a 20 mL 2xYT culture
containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol.
The culture was allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator. The overnight culture was used to inoculate
2 L of ZYP-5052 autoinduction media (Studier). The expression culture
was placed in a LEX48 airlift fermenter and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h and then at 22 °C overnight
(16–20 h). The culture was harvested, pelleted by centrifugation
at 6000g for 10 min, and stored at −80 °C.

The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer
(20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol,
and 5 mM MgCl2) and lysed by sonication. The lysate was
clarified by centrifugation at 35,000g for 45 min.
The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 1 mL HisTrap Ni-NTA column
(GE Healthcare) using an AKTAxpress FPLC (GE Healthcare), washed with
10 column volumes of lysis buffer, and eluted in buffer containing
20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol,
and 5 mM MgCl2. The purified sample was loaded onto a HiLoad
S200 16/60 PR gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer containing
20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM DTT. The purity of the protein was analyzed by SDS–PAGE,
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Site-directed mutants were generated using the overlap extension
method. PCR reactions (50 μL) containing
1 ng of plasmid encoding wild-type l-lyxonate dehydratase,
5 μL of 10× PCR buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTPs,
40 pmol of each primer, and 0.5 units of Phusion (NEB) were performed
to yield megaprimers. The 3′-megaprimer was constructed using
the T7term primer and a sense primer encoding the desired mutation.
The 5′-megaprimer was constructed using the T7pro primer and
an antisense primer encoding the desired mutation. The PCR cycle was
as follows: 95 °C for 4 min followed by 26 cycles of 95 °C
for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and 15 s,
followed by 7 min at 72 °C. The primers were purified by 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis followed by gel extraction (Qiagen). The second
reaction mixture (50 μL) contained 5 μL of 10× PCR
buffer, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dNTPs, 40 pmol each of T7pro and
T7term, 200 pmol of each megaprimer, and 1 unit of Phusion enzyme.
The PCR cycle described above was utilized for this reaction. The
mutant fragments were digested with XhoI (NEB) and NdeI (NEB) and cloned into the pET-15b vector. The plasmids
were sequenced to confirm the presence of the expected mutations.

Growth Experiments
Luria–Bertani broth (LB) cultures
(4 mL) of single colonies were grown overnight. Then, the cultures
were washed three times with 0.5 mL of M9 minimal medium (6.78 g/L
Na2HPO4 7H2O, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L NH4Cl, and 0.5 g/L NaCl). The cells
were resuspended in M9 medium and then used to inoculate fresh 4 mL
glucose M9 minimal media cultures to a starting OD600 of
0.05. The cultures were grown to OD600 of 0.4; then, the
cells were washed three times in M9 minimal medium. The washed cells
were used to inoculate 300 μL of the M9 medium containing a
library of aldonates and aldoses in a Honeycomb 2 plate. The experiments
were performed at 37 °C using a Bioscreen-C automated growth
curve analysis system measuring absorbance at 600 nm every 20 min.

qRT-PCR. Pseudomonas aeruginosa
PAO1 ATCC
47085 was grown in 5 mL of 0.4% glucose M9 minimal medium. The cells
were harvested and washed 3 times with M9 minimal medium. The cells
were used to inoculate two 5 mL cultures of M9 minimal medium, one
containing 0.4% l-lyxonate, and the second 0.4% glucose.
Both cultures were grown to a final cell density OD600 of
0.1. Then cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.5. For preparation of RNA, an equal volume of RNAprotect
bacteria reagent (Qiagen) was added to each culture. After 5 min,
the cells were harvested (10,000g for 5 min at 4
°C); RNA was isolated from the cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s protocols. The isolated
RNA was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm, with one
OD corresponding to 44 μg mL–1. The purity
and integrity of the RNA were assessed spectrophotometrically and
with a 2% agarose gel.

Reverse transcription was performed on
1 μg of RNA by using the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA
synthesis kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
For each gene, 1 μL of the resulting cDNA was PCR-amplified
in 20 μL of reaction mixture. Primers for each gene were designed by the Universal Pro-Be library
system (Roche Applied Science). Real-time PCR was carried out in 96-well
plates using a Roche LightCycler 480 (LC480). The 20 μL PCR
reaction was prepared by adding 1 μL of cDNA template, 2 μL
each of 150 nM forward and reverse primers, and 10 μL of SYBR
2× the concentration of Green Master Mix (Roche). Also, real
time PCR reactions with isolated RNA samples as template were performed
to assess contamination by genomic DNA. The PCR conditions were 1
cycle at 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C
for 15 s, followed by 60 °C for 1 min. The efficiencies of the
primers were calculated as 95 ± 2%. The gene expression data
were expressed as Cp or cross-point value; the 16S rRNA gene was used
as a reference. The data were analyzed by the 2–ΔΔCT calculation method and are the averages
of three biological replicates. Primer sequences are provided in , Table 2.

Crystallization
and Data Collection
LyxD from L. aggregata IAM 12614 (UniProt ID A0NP48) was crystallized by the sitting
drop vapor diffusion method using Hampton Research crystallization
screens. The protein solution (0.5 μL; 12 mg/mL) was mixed with
an equal volume of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 100
μL of the same reservoir solution at room temperature. Acceptable
crystals were obtained using 0.5 M magnesium formate and 0.1 M Bis-Tris
at pH 6.5 as precipitant. Crystals were mounted on cryoloops using
20% glycerol as the cryoprotectant and were flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline
X29 of National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory.
The crystals belong to tetragonal space group I422
with the unit cell parameters a = b = 135.24 and c = 116.73 Å. Data collection
statistics are presented in Table .

The diffraction data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 to generate
a unique set of X-ray intensity data. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using
MOLREP (search model: 3SQS) and initially refined as a rigid body. The initial model was used to generate phases,
and the structure was rebuilt by ARP-wARP. The model was refined in stages by CNS 1.1; the refinement parameters
are included in Table . Model evaluation, addition of water molecules, and fine
adjustment of the final model were carried out with COOT. Structure refinement converged with excellent
geometrical parameters of bond lengths and angles. Model coordinates
and structure factors have been deposited at the PDB (3STP). Because the protein
sample was prepared in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2 and crystallized
with magnesium formate, a magnesium ion with six coordination sites
was modeled in the active site.

Results and Discussion
Sequence
Similarity Network
A representative node sequence similarity
network for the acid sugar dehydratases in the enolase superfamily
is shown in Figure  (MR, d-glucarate
dehydratase, and d-mannonate dehydratase subgroups). This
network was constructed using a BLAST e-value threshold of 10–85 and collects all sequences sharing &gt;95% sequence
identity into the same “metanode”. The circled cluster
in Figure  represents the sequences that are
the subject of this study. At this e-value threshold, the sequences
in the various clusters share ∼40% sequence identity. Gray
nodes represent proteins for which the in vitro activity
is unknown; nodes that are colored have assigned in vitro activities. To date, 9 different functions
have been reported within the MR subgroup, MR, and 8 acid sugar dehydratases
with different substrate specificities, including d-arabinonate
dehydratase (AraD),l-fuconate
dehydratase (FucD),d-galactonate
dehydratase (GalD),d-tartrate
dehydratase (TarD),d-gluconate
dehydratase (GlcD),,l-talarate/galactarate
dehydratase (TalrD/GalrD),l-galactonate dehydratase, and l-rhamnonate dehydratase (RhamD). Enzymes
with novel substrate specificities/functions are expected to populate
the gray clusters.

Representative node sequence similarity network for the
enolase superfamily member excluding the enolase subgroup. Sequences
are shown schematically as nodes (circles); BLAST connections with
E-values ≤10–85 are shown as edges (lines)
that connect the nodes. At this E-value, sequences with known functions
cluster together suggesting that the other clusters likely are isofunctional.
Sequences that have unknown functions are colored gray. The circled
cluster is the LyxD family.

Substrate Identification Using the Acid Sugar Library
Two
uncharacterized proteins, one from Verminephrobacter eiseniae (UniProt ID A1WLE4) and the second from Dianorosiobacter shabila (UniProt
ID A8LS88), were screened for dehydration activity on a library of di- and
monoacid sugars using the semicarbazide assay. After a 16 h incubation at 30 °C, both proteins quantitatively
converted 1 mM l-lyxonate and 1 mM d-gulonate to
their 2-keto-3-deoxy dehydration products; 1 mM l-mannonate
was converted to its dehydration product with a 50% yield. The configurations
of these three acid sugars are identical at carbons 2–4 (Scheme ). The kinetic constants for the three substrates
were determined for both enzymes using a coupled enzyme assay. Dehydration
of l-lyxonate and d-gulonate occurred with values
for kcat/Km of ∼104 M–1 s–1 (Table A); in contrast, dehydration of l-mannonate occurred with low catalytic efficiency.

Genome Neighborhood
We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to determine
the in vivo functions of these enzymes because (1)
its genome is expected to encode an efficient LyxD (70% sequence identity
with A1WLE4 and A8LS88; Table A; the specificity
determining residues in the active site are conserved) and (2) the
organism is genetically tractable. Using M9 minimal medium in the
presence of 0.4% l-lyxonate, d-gulonate, or l-mannonate, we observed growth only with l-lyxonate
(Figure ); therefore, we conclude that P. aeruginosa PAO1 has a catabolic pathway for the utilization
of l-lyxonate. In many sugar catabolic pathways, an aldose
is oxidized by a dehydrogenase to form an aldonolactone; after hydrolysis
by a lactonase, the linear aldonate is dehydrated and further catabolized.
Accordingly, we also attempted to grow P. aeruginosa in the presence of l-lyxose, d-gulose, or l-mannose; however, no growth was observed (, Figure 1).

Growth screening of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. P. aeruginosa PAO1 can utilize l-lyxonate, d-gulonate, l-mannonate, and l-arabinonate as the carbon source. E. coli is not able to metabolize l-lyxonate.

The genome neighborhood of the
gene encoding LyxD in P. aeruginosa PAO1 is shown
in Figure ; this genome context is conserved
for other members of the LyxD family including the two kinetically
characterized LyxD (UniProt IDs A1WLE4 and A8LS88). A plausible pathway for the catabolism
of l-lyxonate is shown in Scheme . This pathway involves dehydration of the product of the LyxD-catalyzed
reaction, 2-keto-3-deoxy-5R-hydroxypentanoate, also
known as 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-lyxonate (L-Kdl) or 2-keto-3-deoxy-l-arabinonate (L-Kda), to generate α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde
(αKGS) that is the substrate for a dehydrogenase that generates
α-ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Candidate
proteins to perform both of these functions are encoded by the genome
neighborhood.

Genome neighborhood of the gene encoding LyxD in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The functions of the proteins
were predicted based on the identities/functions of their closest
homologues. From RT-PCR, the genes encoding LyxD and L-KdlD colored
in purple are cotranscribed. The transporter presumably is a l-lyxonate transporter.

Transcriptomics
To investigate whether the genes that
encode the LyxD and the putative L-Kdl dehydratase and αKGS
dehydrogenase are up-regulated when P. aeruginosa PAO1 is grown on l-lyxonate as carbon source, qRT-PCR was
used to measure transcript levels relative to the level observed with d-glucose as carbon source (, Table 2). The genes encoding these putative enzymes in the l-lyxonate catabolic pathway as well as others in the genome
neighborhood are upregulated 5- to 20-fold when l-lyxonate
was used as the carbon source compared to growth on d-glucose
(Figure ). The up-regulated genes encode a
member of the amidohydrolase (AH) superfamily (IPR006992), a member
of the 4-hydroxythreonine-4-phosphate dehydrogenase family (IPR005255;
PdxA-like protein), LyxD (IPR001354), a member of the fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase superfamily (IPR005255; the putative L-Kdl dehydratase),
and a dehydrogenase (IPR016161; the putative αKGS dehydrogenase;
αKGSDH).

QRT-PCR results. The genes in the genome neighborhood
of LyxD are upregulated 5–20-fold when the bacteria are grown
on l-lyxonate (compared to d-glucose).

We also used the cDNA generated from the RNA transcripts
isolated when l-lyxonate was used as a carbon source to determine
which genes are cotranscribed, with the expectation that these would
participate in the same pathway. In Figure , the genes on the same transcript are designated with the same color:
(1) green, a transporter, the member of the AH superfamily and the
PdxA-like protein; (2) magenta, a second transporter, LyxD, and L-Kdl
dehydratase; and (3) orange, αKGSDH. These transcript assignments
are in good agreement with the qRT-PCR results in which genes on the
same transcript are equivalently up-regulated.

Characterization of the
Pathway Enzymes: L-Kdl Dehydratase
To further explore the l-lyxonate catabolic pathway, the genes that were up-regulated
in P. aeruginosa PAO1 were separately cloned into
the pET-15b expression vector and overexpressed, and the proteins
were purified to homogeneity. Unfortunately, the putative LyxD was
expressed as an insoluble protein; however, because it shares 70%
sequence identity with the kinetically characterized LyxDs and its
active site contains the same substrate specificity determining residues
(vide infra), we conclude that this protein is a
LyxD.

On the basis of the transcript analysis and the known
functions of homologues of the proteins encoded by the neighboring
genes (Figure ), we proposed that the next
enzyme in the catabolic pathway is L-Kdl dehydratase (Scheme ). Although L-Kdl is an intermediate in the l-arabinose catabolic pathway, the dehydratase that converts
L-Kdl to α-ketoglutarate semialdehyde in that pathway is a member
of the dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS) superfamily.

The putative L-Kdl dehydratase encoded
by the P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome is a member of the
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) superfamily. However, the genome neighborhoods of Labrenzia
aggregata IAM 12614 and several other organisms that encode
a LyxD lack the putative L-Kdl dehydratase from the FAH family; instead,
they include a gene that encodes a member of the DHDPS family that
likely is the L-Kdl dehydratase.

The previously characterized
2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate dehydratase (D-Kda) in the FAH
superfamily utilizes Mg2+ to stabilize the enolate anion
intermediate. The mechanism
of the putative L-Kdl dehydratase reaction in the DHDPS superfamily
is expected to involve the formation of a Schiff base between the
substrate and an active site Lys residue. The kinetic constants for the FAH superfamily L-Kdl dehydratases
from P. aeruginosa PAO1 (UniProt accession ID Q9I1Q1) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (UniProt accession
ID Q7CX99) and the DHDPS superfamily dehydratase from L. aggregata (UniProt accession ID A0NP47) were measured with a coupled enzyme
assay (Table ). The catalytic efficiencies
of all three dehydratases are 104–105 M–1 s–1, so these analogous
enzymes have evolved to catalyze the reaction with the same catalytic
efficiencies.

semialdehyde, the product of the L-Kda/L-Kdl dehydratase (Scheme ). The kinetic constants were determined with a
spectrophotometric assay and are presented in Table . As predicted, this protein catalyzes the αKGSDH reaction
(catalytic efficiency 105 M–1 s–1).

AH and PdxA-Like Enzymes
The genes encoding the AH
and PdxA-like proteins are up-regulated in l-lyxonate grown
cells (green, Figure ); however, they are
not involved in the catabolism of l-lyxonate. The substrates
for these enzymes are unknown. The genome for P. aeruginosa PAO1 encodes an authentic PdxA protein, so the presence of this
paralogue suggests a new, but as of yet unknown, function for this
PdxA-like protein.

Phenotypes of Transposon-Insertion Mutants
To further determine whether the genes in the neighborhood of that
encoding LyxD were required for growth on l-lyxonate, we
performed growth experiments using strains from a P. aeruginosa PAO1 mutant library generated by transposon-insertion mutagenesis. Mutant strains containing disruptions in the
genes encoding LyxD, the nearby transporter, and L-Kdl dehydratase
(purple, Figure ) lost the ability to grow
on l-lyxonate (Figure ). Mutant strains
containing disruptions in the genes encoding the member of the AH
superfamily and the PdxA-like protein retained wild type growth on l-lyxonate.

Growth phenotypes of knockouts. Knockouts of genes in P. aeruginosa PAO1 encoding a transporter, PdxA-like protein,
porin, l-lyxonate transporter, LyxD, and αKGSDH were
tested for growth on l-lyxonate. Strains carrying deletions
in the genes encoding the l-lyxonate transporter, LyxD, and
αKGSDH lost their ability to utilize l-lyxonate.

These results provide further
support for not only the in vitro activities but
also the results from the transcriptomic studies. Taken together,
our in vitro enzymatic assays and in vivo physiological studies establish that LyxD, L-Kdl dehydratase, and
αKGSDH are responsible for the catabolism of l-lyxonate.

X-ray Structure
A structure for LyxD from L. aggregata IAM 12614 (UniProt AC A0NP48, with Mg2+, and PDB
entry 3STP)
was determined that showed the bidomain structure observed in other
members of the enolase superfamily: an (α + β) capping
domain and a (β/α)7β-barrel domain. The
α + β capping domain contains residues 1–145 at
the N-terminus and residues 377–390 at the C-terminus of the
polypeptide; the barrel domain contains residues 146–337.

In members of the MR subgroup, the distal portion of the substrate
interacts with the 20s and 50s loops in the (α + β) capping
domain, so these are important in determining substrate specificity.
In LyxD, the 20s loop is long, containing residues 14–45 (Figure ); the 50s loop is very short, containing only residues
65–66.

(A) Structure of LyxD from L. aggregata IAM 12614 (PDB: 3STP). The “20s loop” is colored orange. (B) Active site
structure. The substrate is colored green, and the specificity-determining
residues are colored gray. Residues in yellow are conserved catalytic
residues.

We were unable to obtain a liganded
structure for any LyxD. The 20s loop is closed in PDB entry 3STP, so it was used
as a template for in silico docking of l-lyxonate (Figure ). The ligands for the
required Mg2+ ion are Glu 214, Glu 240, and Glu 266 located
at the C-terminal ends of third, fourth, and fifth β-strands.
As expected for a member of the MR subgroup, His316, located at the
C-terminal end of the seventh β-strand, forms a hydrogen-bonded
dyad with Asp289, located at the C-terminal end of the sixth β-strand;
together, they act as the general basic catalyst that initiates the
reaction.

In other MR members, two Lys residues are located
at the C-terminal end of the second β-strand, the first acting
as an electrophile to interact with one oxygen of the substrate’s
carboxylate group and a second acting as an acid/base catalyst. In
the LyxD family, Lys177 and Arg 179 (KxR motif) are located at the
C-terminal end of the second β-strand.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed to investigate
the catalytic roles of Arg 179 and His 316 (Table B). The H316Q mutant had no detectable catalytic activity,
as expected if His 316 is the general base that initiates the reaction.
Also, the R179Q mutation also abolished LyxD activity. Mutating Arg
179 to a Lys gave rise to an insoluble protein, preventing kinetic
characterization. In the vicinity of Arg 179, Tyr 216 points toward
the active site; mutation to Phe did not affect the activity, suggesting
that Tyr 216 has no catalytic role (Table B). The sequence alignment of LyxD orthologues showed that His 316
and Arg 179 are conserved (Figure ).

Multiple sequence alignment of LyxD orthologues. Secondary
structure elements are shown on top based on the 3STP structure: α-helices
with squiggles, β-strands with arrows, and turns with TT. Conserved
residues are highlighted in black. The red boxes denote the required
His 316 and Arg 179 that are the conserved catalytic residues. ESPript
(http://espript.ibcp.fr) was used to generate the alignment.

Conclusions
Many
members of the MR subgroup of the enolase superfamily are encoded
by gene clusters/operons that encode proteins involved in sugar catabolism
(e.g., kinases, dehydratases, dehydrogenases, and aldolases). The members of the previously uncharacterized
cluster in Figure  were identified as LyxDs.
Enzymatic, phenotypic, and transcriptomic data identify the catabolic
pathway in which LyxD participates, the conversion of l-lyxonate
to α-ketoglutarate.
