Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common
nosocomial sources of soft-tissue and skin infections and has more
recently become prevalent in the community setting as well. Since
the use of penicillins to combat S. aureus infections
in the 1940s, the bacterium has been notorious for developing resistances
to antibiotics, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). With the persistence of MRSA as well as many
other drug resistant bacteria and parasites, there is a growing need
to focus on new pharmacological targets. Recently, class II fructose
1,6-bisphosphate aldolases (FBAs) have garnered attention to fill
this role. Regrettably, scarce biochemical data and no structural
data are currently available for the class II FBA found in MRSA (SaFBA).
With the recent finding of a flexible active site zinc-binding loop
(Z-Loop) in class IIa FBAs and its potential for broad spectrum class
II FBA inhibition, the lack of information regarding this feature
of class IIb FBAs, such as SaFBA, has been limiting for further Z-loop
inhibitor development. Therefore, we elucidated the crystal structure
of SaFBA to 2.1 Å allowing for a more direct structural analysis
of SaFBA. Furthermore, we determined the KM for one of SaFBA’s substrates, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,
as well as performed mode of inhibition studies for an inhibitor that
takes advantage of the Z-loop’s flexibility. Together the data
offers insight into a class IIb FBA from a pervasively drug resistant
bacterium and a comparison of Z-loops and other features between the
different subtypes of class II FBAs.

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for what is commonly referred
to as a staph infection. Symptoms of staph infections range from skin
and soft tissue infection to necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, and
even death.1 Although staph infections
are predominantly transmitted nosocomially, S. aureus has also been found in cases outside of a hospital setting.2−6 In 2011, there were over 80,000 cases resulting in more than 11,000
deaths reported in the US caused by various strains of S.
aureus.3 Even with several advances
having been made in combatting S. aureus infections
in the form of various antibiotics, the bacterium has continued to
survive and develop resistances.7−13

Infections by S. aureus were initially treated
using penicillin starting in the 1940s; however, within a few years
resistance to the treatment had emerged.1 To combat this resistance, a penicillin analogue known as methicillin
was created. Methicillin was first utilized to treat staph infections
in 1959 and worked in the same manner as other penicillins by disrupting
the class of proteins known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs),
transpeptidase enzymes involved with cross-linking bacteria cell wall
precursors.1 Disruption of PBPs leads to
weakened cell walls and eventually cell death. Yet, by the 1960s cases
of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
strains began to emerge in Europe and the US.14 Currently there are strains of MRSA resistant to all β-lactams
including penicillin derivatives and cephalospoins, as well as other
non-β-lactam antibiotics such as aminoglycosides like vanomycin,
fluoroquinolones, and macrolides.7−13

MRSA was first thought to only occur in a hospital setting
under
conditions that increased the risk factor for exposure.6 However, in the 1980s there were several outbreaks
of MRSA in patients who had not encountered a hospital setting. Furthermore,
in 1999 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on four previously
healthy children whose skin infections were treated with cephalosporins,
but whose eventual death was proven to be caused by MRSA.5 As such MRSA is typically categorized into three
main categories: Hospital-Acquired (HA), Healthcare-Associated Community-Onset
(HACO), and Community-Acquired (CA). Although the number of MRSA cases
reported has been on the decline, there were over 80,000 cases reported
in the US in 2011, greater than 75% of which were either HA- or HACO-MRSA.2−4 Interestingly, from 2005 to 2011 the incident rates of HA-MRSA and
HACO-MRSA has declined by ∼54% and ∼27%, respectively,
but CA-MRSA rates have only dropped by ∼5%.4 The CDC estimates that roughly one-third of people carry
some variant of S. aureus in their nose and that
nearly one in 50 people carry MRSA without any symptoms.3

With the persistence and evolving nature
of MRSA, increasing focus
has been placed on potentially new pharmacological targets. One such
target is S. aureus’s fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase (SaFBA). As a class II fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase,
SaFBA falls into one of two classes of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolases
(FBAs). Both class I and class II FBAs catalyze the reversible aldol
condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) with glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate (G3P) to form fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP).15 However, the two enzyme classes differ in their
mechanism of catalysis and prevalence among species. Specifically,
class I FBAs utilize a lysine residue to generate a nucleophilic enamine
from DHAP, whereas class II aldolases utilize a Zn(II) cation to stabilize
the DHAP enolate intermediate involved in the aldol condensation reaction.
Also, the location of a key amino acid side chain responsible for
proton extraction and addition significantly differs.16−18 Beyond the differences in their reaction mechanisms, the two classes
of FBAs distinctly differ in their distribution among species. Higher
organisms such as humans possess only class I FBAs, whereas protozoa,
bacteria, fungi, and blue-green algae primarily have class II FBAs,
with a few possessing both.19−21

Class II FBAs are essential
for the survival of both Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria as shown through knockout studies of several
organisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia
coli, Streptomyces galbus, Bacillus subtilis, Peudomonas aeruginosa,
Streptococcus pneumonia, and Candida albicans in which deletion
of the fba gene resulted in a loss of viability.22−31 Even in organisms that possess both class I and class II FBAs, such
as E. coli, the lack of the class II FBA was shown
to be detrimental.23,32,33 As a result, significant efforts have been taken to develop inhibitors
of class II FBAs for use as treatments related to bacterial and protozoan
infections such as tuberculosis.34−38 Therefore, selective inhibitors developed for class
II FBAs are unlikely to generate toxic effects through disruption
of the human class I FBA thus making class II FBAs a highly sought
after bacterial target for pharmacological development.

Class
II FBAs can be categorized as class IIa or class IIb on the
basis of sequence homology. Although class IIa FBAs were traditionally
thought to be all dimers, recent findings have shown that there exist
certain exceptions, such as the class IIa FBA from Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MtFBA), which forms a tetramer.17 Meanwhile, class IIb FBAs can range from dimers
to tetramers to even octomers and tend to be shorter in amino acid
length than their class IIa counterparts.17,19,20,39,40 Furthermore, sequence alignments of class IIb FBAs
suggest that this group might be divided into at least four additional
subtypes (i-iv) although certain discrepancies exist within the purely
sequence-based categorization.40,41 To date, only the structures
of class IIb-i FBAs have been studied in regard to their enzymatic
capacities.20,42−45 Based on sequence composition,
SaFBA appears to belong to the class IIb-iv of FBAs; however, no structure
of either SaFBA, or a proposed class IIb-iv FBA, has yet been reported
(Figure 1).

Figure 1 Sequence alignment of class II FBAs. FBAs
are from Staphylococcus
aureus (S. aureus; Q5HE75), Bacillus anthracis (B. anthra; PDB entry 3Q94_A), Giardia
lamblia (G. lamblia; 3GAK_B), Helicobacter
pylori (H. pylori;3N9S_A), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M. tuber; NP_334786), and Escherichia coli (E. coli; PDB entry 1DOS_A). FBA names
are colored based on class II grouping: tan denotes class IIb-i, purple
denotes class IIb-iv, and black denotes class IIa. Secondary structure
of SaFBA according to Defined Secondary Structure of Proteins (DSSP)
is shown as tan cylinders (helical regions), teal arrows (β-sheets),
and tan lines (loops). Hashed lines represent residues for which electron
density was not defined in the crystal structure. Green line represents
the active site loop. Cyan line represents the Z-loop. Breaks denote
regions were SaFBA does not have residues. Black brackets indicate
residues that are part of SaFBA’s active site. Amino acids
are color-coded with respect to being acidic (red), basic (blue),
polar uncharged (yellow), and hydrophobic nonpolar (green).

This lack of information has proven
problematic in light of the
discovery that 8-hydroxyquinoline-2-carboxylic acid (HCA) inhibits
MtFBA, a class IIa FBA. Unlike previous class II FBA inhibitors whose
design has centered primarily on developing analogues of DHAP and
FBP to act as competitive active site inhibitors, HCA capitalizes
on the flexibility of an active site zinc-binding loop (Z-loop) found
within MtFBA to act as a noncompetitive inhibitor.46 This mode of inhibition appears to side step previous issues
of class I FBA promiscuity of the substrate mimic-styled inhibitors,
plus the need for inhibitors to possess highly charged phosphate groups,
which hinder membrane permeability.19,34−37,43,47−49 Regrettably, the composition of the Z-loop region
as well as other potential structural features in the vicinity appear
to differ between the two subclasses of FBAs and even among class
IIb FBA subtypes (Figure 1).

To gain
a more complete understanding of how SaFBA compares to
its class II FBA counterparts, the first X-ray crystal structure of
SaFBA was elucidated to 2.1 Å and compared to that of MtFBA as
well as to other class IIb FBAs. Analysis of the crystal structure
was performed revealing that the Z-loop in SaFBA can be readily displaced
from the active site. Furthermore, the KM value for one of the SaFBA substrates, FBP, as well as the Ki for HCA were determined and compared to those
of MtFBA.

Production and Purification of SaFBA
The production
of the FBA expression vector for a methicillin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (SaFBA) was generated using Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 optimized
synthesis by Genscript, Inc. The SaFBA expression construct encodes
the 289 amino acids from UniProtKB entry Q5HE75.1 as well
as six histidines and a stop codon to generate a C-terminal histidine
tag. The pET11a-fbaA plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) by heat-shock transformation for enzyme
expression. The resulting plasmid was then purified, restriction analyzed,
and sequenced to verify the construct. The expression system produced
a C-terminal, His-tagged fusion protein, which is herein termed SaFBA.
Cells containing SaFBA were grown in 12 L of LB broth containing 100
μg/mL ampicillin until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached.
Expression of the SaFBA was induced by addition of IPTG to a final
concentration of 0.4 mM, and the culture was grown for an addition
4–6 h at 25 °C. Following this period, the bacterial cells
were isolated via centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and stored at −80 °C. The cell pellets were
suspended in Buffer A [300 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0)] and lysed
by addition of 5 mg of chicken lysozyme followed by sonication. The
insoluble cell debris was separated via centrifugation for 45 min
at 17,000 × g. SaFBA was purified from the resulting
supernatant by using a Qiagen Ni-NTA column and eluted with Buffer
A containing 300 mM imidazole followed by buffer exchange into Buffer
B [100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tricine (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM ZnCl2] by passage over a Superdex-S200 High Resolution column.
The purified SaFBA was concentrated to 12 mg/mL via 10,000 molecular
weight cutoff centrifugal filter units (Millipore Cork, IRL) at 4000
× g. The final protein was then filtered through
0.22 μM Costar spin filters. All protein concentrations were
determined through UV–visible spectroscopy at 280 nm using
molar extinction coefficients experimentally derived by the method
of Gill and von Hippel.50

FBA Enzymatic
FBP Cleavage Assays
The activity of FBAs
was monitored through a fluorescence-based assay measuring the increase
in fluorescence due to conversion of resazurin to resorufin via diaphorase
when coupled with the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. The assay
mixture (final volume of 50 μL) contained 0.4 mM NAD+, 8 units/mL GAPDH, 0.01% (w/v) BSA, 2 mM DTT, 15 mM NaH2AsO4, 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.8), 100 mM CH3COOK,
180 nM MtTPI, 1 unit/μL diaphorase, and 50 μM resazurin.
A final assay concentration of 40 nM SaFBA was used. All assays were
performed at room temperature and in duplicate using Costar 96-well
half area, black flat-bottom polystyrene plates (Corning). All FBA
activity assays were conducted using a TECAN M1000 plate reader by
measuring the fluorescence of resorufin at 585 nm when it was excited
at 535 nm. A standard curve for FBP conversion was determined previously
for the conversion to molecules turned over.46 The values for KM and kcat were determined from the rates of the initial velocity
data as the concentration of FBP was varied from 0 μM to 4000
μM for the Michaelis–Menten equation, ν = Vmax/(1 + KM/[S]),
using the Enzyme Kinetics Module of SigmaPlot, version 12.2 (SPSS,
Inc.).

The IC50 value for the inhibition of SaFBA
by HCA was determined at HCA concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mM,
with the FBP concentration held constant at 250 μM. The percent
inhibition (I%) was calculated using the formula I% = [1 – (νsample – νnegative control)/(νpositive control – νnegative control)] × 100. The
resulting I% values were fit via nonlinear regression
to the equation I% = I%max/(1 + IC50/ [HCA]) using the Enzyme Kinetics Module of
SigmaPlot. The IC50 value for citrate inhibition of SaFBA
was conducted in a similar manner with the exception that sodium citrate
at a pH = 7.8 was utilized and its concentration was varied from 0
mM to 140 mM.

To determine the mode of action of HCA, inhibition
studies were
conducted using HCA concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 μM
with three additional concentrations of FBP ranging from 125 to 1,000
μM used to initiate the reaction. Initial velocity data were
fit using nonlinear regression analysis to each of the equations describing
partial and full models of competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive,
and mixed inhibition using the Enzyme Kinetics Module of SigmaPlot.
On the basis of the analysis of fits through “goodness-of-fit”
statistics, the full mixed inhibition model was determined with the
equation ν = Vmax/ [((KM/[S]) × (1 + [I]/Ki)
+ (1 + [I]/(α × Ki])], where
[S] = [FBP], [I] = [HCA], and Ki is the
constant for dissociation of HCA from free SaFBA.

Crystallization
of SaFBA
The initial crystal conditions
for SaFBA were determined through high-throughput screening of Qiagen
Classics I and II screens in a 96-well sitting drop format using an
Art Robbins Phoenix robot. Drops contained 0.4 μL of precipitate
with a 100-μL reservoir volume. Initial screening resulted in
crystals from conditions with 1.8 M ammonium citrate (pH 7.0) and
12 mg/mL of SaFBA; however, further screening containing 1.6 M ammonium
citrate (pH 7.5) produced the most viable crystals. These crystals
were optimized using the Additive HT Screen from Hampton Research.
Final SaFBA crystals were obtained through hanging-drop vapor diffusion
at 20 °C and included using a 500-μL reservoir of 1.6 M
ammonium citrate (pH 7.5) with 4-μL hanging drops mixed 1:1
with protein solution and an additional 0.25 μL of 3 M dimethylethylammonium
propanesulfonate, a zwitterionic nondetergent sulfobetaine termed
NSDB-195.

X-ray Structure of SaFBA
An X-ray data set was collected
using a crystal mounted onto a nylon loop flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
The crystal was mounted under a stream of dry N2 at 100
K. An SaFBA data set with resolution to 2.10 Å was collected
at Advance Light Source (ALS) beamline 4.2.2 using a monochromatic
X-ray beam of 1.00 Å with a CMOS_8 M detector. X-ray images were
indexed, processed, integrated, and scaled using XDS.51 An initial phase solution was elucidated using holo-MtFBA
[Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4DEF] as a starting model for molecular replacement using
Phaser.52 The structure was refined using
iterative cycles of model building and refinement using COOT and phenix.refine,
respectively.53,54 Water molecules were added to
2Fo–Fc density peaks of &gt;1σ using the Find Water COOT program
function.
The final model was checked for structural quality using the CCP4
suite programs Procheck and Sfcheck. The data refinement statistics
are listed in Table 1.

Results
Determination
of SaFBA Crystal Structure
To understand
more clearly how structural features, such as the Z-loop in SaFBA
compare to other class II FBAs, SaFBA was expressed, purified, and
screened against several suites of commercially available precipitant
screens followed by optimization via an additive screen. The final
crystal condition was comprised of 1.6 M ammonium citrate pH 7.5 and
was optimized with 3 M NDSB 195, yielding a 2.1 Å data set in
a P21212 space group (Table 1).

SaFBA was observed as a dimer in the asymmetric
unit with the secondary structure of each monomer resembling the TIM
barrel fold of other class II FBAs, such as MtFBA (Figure 2a,b). The dimeric nature of SaFBA in the asymmetric
unit is consistent with the oligomeric state suggested by size exclusion
chromatography (data not shown). Of the SaFBA’s 295 amino acids,
all showed good electron density except for residues 1, 144, 145,
183–187, and 288–295. The structure is comprised of
12 α-helices and 8 β-sheets. Comparison of SaFBA and MtFBA
immediately highlighted the differences between class IIb and class
IIa FBAs. Several helices such as α3, α5, and α6
are shifted considerably, and helices α8b, α8c, and a
310 in MtFBA are not present in SaFBA (Figure 2c). This is reflective of the additional length
that class IIa FBAs possess over their class IIb counterparts.

but only partially in the SaFBA structure. (d) SaFBA same as in (b)
but overlaid with HpFBA-TD4 (PDB code: 3N9S_A) shown in maroon. The β5α5
loop (green) and the β6α6 loop (blue) for which is density
was observed in the HpFBA-TD4 structure and only partially in the
SaFBA structure.

Conversely, evaluation
of SaFBA to the class IIb FBA from Helicobacter pylori (HpFBA) illustrates a higher degree
of commonality. However, some noticeable differences are still present,
particularly in relation to the β5α5 and β6α6
loops (Figure 2d). The β5α5 loop
consisting of SaFBA residues 139–148, termed the active site
loop as it contains a residue critical for the deprotonation/protonation
step of the class II FBA-facilitated reaction, is highly flexible
in the apo and holo forms of class II FBAs as evidenced by almost
all elucidated class II FBA structures missing electron density of
at least one, or more, residues within this region.20,42,55 Likewise, in the active site loop of our
SaFBA structure only residues Glu144 and Gln145 are missing.

Unlike the active site loop within class II FBAs, the β6α6
loop containing residues 177–191, and previously termed the
Z-loop, is almost always well-defined structurally.17,19,20,34,42,44,45,49,56−60 This loop forms part of the substrate pocket as well as contains
a histidine residue involved in coordination with the active site
Zn(II) ion.46 Between class IIb FBAs, such
as HpFBA, whose structures have been reported, and SaFBA, HpFBA possess
two additional residues within this region. Additionally, all previously
reported class IIb FBAs also possess an α-helix located near
the Z-loop not seen in either SaFBA or MtFBA (Figure 2d). It is unclear whether this helix is influential in the
enzyme’s functionality, but it may be part of the reason as
to why HpFBA’s Z-loop is two residues longer than that of SaFBA.
Interestingly for the SaFBA structure, there was no electron density
observed for residues 183–187 in its Z-loop, and His181 was
displaced from its coordination of the Zn(II) ion. Closer inspection
of this region using a simulated omit map revealed Fo–Fc density of a citrate
molecule coordinating the active site Zn(II) in a tridentate manner
(Figure 3). This interaction is curiously similar
to that observed previously between MtFBA and the Z-loop inhibitor
HCA. Naturally, the likely source of this citrate ion is the crystallization
condition that contained 1.6 M ammonium citrate. Along with the three
coordinating bonds to the citrate ion, the active site Zn(II) also
forms an additional three coordinating bonds with residues His86 and
His209 and a water molecule. These interactions yield a coordination
number of 6 (T6) for the active site Zn(II) similar to
that of the FBP-bound structure of MtFBA and different from the T5 coordination found in the inhibitor-bound structure of HpFBA
for which the entire protein was observed including the active site
loop (Figure 4).17,43 This coordination
state is also different from the T5 coordination state
observed in the HCA bound MtFBA structure. Additionally, the citrate
ion forms hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) with Asn233 and Gly210, as well
as a network of H-bonds through several waters to Glu137, His181,
and Asp85 (Figure 3).

Probing SaFBA’s Substrate Affinity
for FBP, HCA, and
Citrate
FBAs catalyze the reversible aldol condensation of
DHAP with G3P to form FBP. To gain insight on the affinity of SaFBA
for FBP, a fluorescence-based assay was employed. Using the initial
slopes over a series of FBP concentrations, the KM and kcat values of SaFBA
for FBP were found to be 239 ± 16 μM and 69.5 ± 1.6
min–1, respectively (Figure 5a). These values fall within the range of several other class II
FBAs.61−64

as the HCA concentration was increased from 0 to 2 mM. (d) Plot of
inhibition of SaFBA as the citrate concentration was increased from
0 to 560 mM. All plots were fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation. 

Previously, we illustrated that
HCA inhibited SaFBA activity; however,
this data was obtained at a concentration of FBP over 3-fold lower
than its KM.46 Therefore, to gain a more complete analysis of HCA’s inhibition
of SaFBA a dose–response relationship was conducted using a
total of five different concentrations of FBP and ten different HCA
concentrations. This allowed for determination of the mode of inhibition
of HCA for SaFBA as well as to clarify whether that mode would be
consistent with the noncompetitive manner observed when HCA inhibited
MtFBA (Figure 5b). Surprisingly, unlike MtFBA
whose kcat changed while its KM remained constant, both the kcat as well as the KM values of SaFBA varied
for each condition tested. This along with nonlinear regression analysis
indicated that HCA inhibits in a mixed manner with a Ki of 96 ± 22 μM (Figure 5b).

With a citrate ion located in the active
site coordinating with
the active site Zn(II) ion in a similar manner as that of HCA in the
MtFBA-HCA structure, the ability of citrate to inhibit SaFBA was also
explored.46 Analyzing the dose–response
inhibitory effects of citrate ion on SaFBA, while at the KM of FBP, revealed an IC50 of 56.9 ± 3.5
mM with an Imax of 76.9 ± 1.9% (Figure 5d). This was 250-fold higher than that observed
for HCA, IC50 of 227 ± 29 μM, at the same concentration
(Figure 5c). Interestingly, previous studies
on bacteria have proposed a citrate concentration within the cytoplasm
in the range of 7–21 mM.14,65 At the higher end of
this range, SaFBA might be inhibited ∼10%, or more, pending
mode of inhibition. This suggests inhibition of SaFBA by citrate may
warrant future studies to flesh out its biological significance.

Discussion
Structural Based Categorization of Class II FBAs
Previously,
class II FBAs could be grouped into either IIa or IIb on the basis
of their sequence homology and oligomeric state.19,20,39,40,64 Genetic studies of several pathogenic bacteria in
which the fba gene was removed resulted in a loss
of viability for the organism.22−31 As a result, over the past few years the potential benefit of using
class II FBAs as targets for therapeutic development has spurred the
elucidation of a number of class II FBA structures.17,19,20,34,42,45,66 Taking this additional structural information into consideration,
the differences within these classes become readily apparent. For
instance among class IIa FBAs, MtFBA possesses several helices facilitating
a tetrameric organization setting itself structurally apart from all
other structurally characterized class IIa FBAs, such as the one from E. coli as well as a recent unreported protein data bank
entry from Campylobacter jejuni (PDB Code: 3QM3).17 However, MtFBA is likely not alone in its tetrameric organization.
Other class IIa FBAs, such as Mycobacterium leprae and Coryenbacterium glutamicum, may contain similar
structural elements whose purpose in light of the MtFBA structure
can now be realized.41 Naturally, with
the additional structural insight the MtFBA structure provided, a
case can be made for two subtypes of class IIa, class IIai and class
IIaii.

Similar to MtFBA, the SaFBA structure appears to have
the same clarifying effect for class IIb FBAs. Previously, Plaumann
et al. proposed possible functional roles to delineate class IIb FBA
subtypes, while Henze et al. further outlined at least four class
IIb FBA subtypes (i-iv).40,41 Due to the limited
data at the time neither group could definitively assemble each putative
class IIb FBA studied into an appropriate subtype. Regrettably, subsequent
reported structures of class IIb FBA structures from H. pylori and Giardia lamblia (GlFBA)
provided only a little additional clarity. Although their sequence
alignment score as determined by ClustalW was 0.41, analysis of the
structures by the Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies
(PISA) server revealed a score of 0.80 indicating that they likely
belong to a single subtype.41,67 Intriguingly, when
SaFBA was run through the PISA server it was shown to be most similar
to the FBA from Bacillus anthracis (BaFBA) with a
score of 0.88 and when compared to GlFBA both SaFBA and BaFBA scored
roughly 0.70 implying that SaFBA and BaFBA likely fall into their
own subtype. Using SaFBA along with the recent deposition of class
IIb FBAs from B. anthracis (PDB Code: 3Q94) and Coccoidioides
immitis (PDB Code: 3PM6) into the PDB, an updated categorization of class
IIb subtypes can be envisioned (Figure 6).42 Specifically, the class II FBAs from G. lamblia and H. pylori contain an insertion
of ∼21 residues that does not align with SaFBA or other class
IIb FBAs such as BaFBA (Figure 1). The result
of this insert is an additional α-helix seen in several class
IIb FBAs but missing in others (Figure 6).
The additional helix seen in the likes of GlFBA and HpFBA confirm
the assertion by Henze et al. that they belong to the same subtype,
class IIb-i. Although neither SaFBA nor BaFBA were previously analyzed
for a class IIb subtype, both share &gt;79% similarity and &gt;80%
identity
with Bacillus subtilis which was categorized as class
IIb-iv.41 Furthermore, the nearly completely
conserved crystal structures of SaFBA and the currently unreported
BaFBA implicate that they belong to the same subtype. It remains to
be determined structurally whether other subtypes exist as previously
reported or what, if any, the functional differences between each
subtype may be.40,41 Therefore, SaFBA can most accurately
be classified as a class IIb-iv. It is interesting to note that the
additional helix in class IIb-i FBAs is positioned very near the Z-loop,
and the composition of this helix may play a role in substrate binding.
In the case of GlFBA, a shift in this loop was noticed when comparing
the unbound structure to that of GlFBA with FBP bound.44 Only with further mutagenesis and enzymatic
testing will reveal the function and significance of this discrepancy
between class IIb FBAs be elucidated.

helix seen in class IIb-i FBAs due to the 21 amino acid insertion.

Z-Loop Based Inhibitors
Previously, HCA was revealed
to be a potential inhibitor for class IIa FBAs.46 Specifically, several structures of MtFBA demonstrated
the concept that HCA capitalized on the flexible dynamic nature of
the Z-loop to create a hydrophobic pocket to bind. Based on both class
IIa and IIb FBAs relying on an active site Zn(II) ion for enzymatic
function, not surprisingly the identity of residues that comprise
their active sites remain largely conserved (Figure 4). This includes those located in the Z-loop involved with
coordination of the active site Zn(II). However, as previously discussed,
the Z-loop itself is not entirely conserved between class IIa and
class IIb FBAs, nor are many of the structural features surrounding
it (Figures 1 and 2).
Naturally, this spurred speculation whether the dynamic range observed
in the Z-loop of MtFBA and the ability of HCA to capitalize on this
feature is an isolated example, representative of only class IIa FBAs,
or of class II FBAs in general. Fascinatingly, the SaFBA structure
proposes the latter. Specifically, the SaFBA structure disclosed the
ability of the small molecule citrate to wedge itself between the
Z-loop of SaFBA and its Zn(II) in a related manner to that observed
between MtFBA and HCA. Hence, demonstrating that even class IIb FBAs
can be vulnerable to small molecules such as HCA, or other small molecules
derived from that platform, which are designed to exploit the dynamic
nature of the Z-loop (Figure 3).

Interestingly,
while HCA inhibited the class IIa FBA from M. tuberculosis in a noncompetitive manner, the data from this study shows that
HCA inhibits the class IIb FBA from S. aureus in
a mixed fashion and with an almost 8-fold weaker Ki. Since class II FBAs all function via an active site
Zn(II) ion, the reason for the different modes of inhibition may be
more closely tied to the structural differences between the two subclasses.
Structures of class IIb FBAs from G. lamblia and B. anthracis have been solved with FBP and DHAP bound respectively
and illustrate that they bind in an identical fashion to that of MtFBA.17,44 One of the major differences between class IIa and IIb FBAs is that
class IIa possesses an active site loop which is ∼5 residues
longer. As a result of this longer active site loop, HCA binding is
not influenced by a substrate being present. Conversely, the presence
of a substrate in a class IIb FBA would cause the hydrophobic pocket
that HCA takes advantage of to be constricted due to the reduced length
of the active site loop. As a result, for class IIb FBAs the presence
of HCA likely reduces the ability for the active site loop to interact
with the substrates. The fact that HCA appears to bind more tightly
to MtFBA than SaFBA, as indicted by their differences in Ki, suggests that the longer active site loop aids in HCA
binding. Since the active site loop does not appear to form any direct
interactions with HCA in MtFBA, it is likely that the reduced strain
on the hydrophobic pocket of the binding site is responsible for the
increase in binding. Of course more data will be necessary to verify
these conclusions such as determining HCA’s mode of action
against other class IIa/b FBAs as well as obtaining a crystal structure
of a class IIb FBA with HCA bound. However, the fact that the mobility
of the Z-loop allows for the incorporation of small molecules, such
as HCA and citrate, that capitalize on the coordination of the active
site Zn(II) ion, as well as the active site residue, adds to the structural
information on class II FBAs which can be utilized to design potential
inhibitors.
