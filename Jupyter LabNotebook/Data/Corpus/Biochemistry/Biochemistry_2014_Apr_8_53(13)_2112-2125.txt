Iron-containing proteins are
integral components of fundamental physiological processes such as
DNA synthesis, gene regulation, respiration, oxygen transport, and
degradation of xenobiotics., The relative availability
of iron in the host environment is an important determinant of virulence,
which is why iron bioavailability is associated with sepsis, and an innate response of the immune system is
to deploy iron-binding proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin
to decrease free iron concentrations to vanishingly low levels (≈10–18 M) in plasma. In spite
of the iron-limiting conditions imposed by the host, pathogenic bacteria
can establish infections, which is a manifestation of the molecular
mechanisms that have evolved in pathogens to procure iron from their
host. Approximately 95% of all iron in mammals is found in hemoglobin
heme. Consequently, hemoglobin and other
host proteins that scavenge hemoglobin or heme from blood plasma,
such as hemopexin, haptoglobin, and serum albumin, are a source of
iron for pathogenic bacteria. Indeed,
pathogenic bacteria are able to overcome the extremely low levels
of free iron within their mammalian hosts by deploying several iron
and heme iron acquisition systems.− Some Gram-negative bacteria
deploy the has (heme acquisition system), which is
characterized by the secretion of the hemophore HasA to bind and sequester
extracellular heme and deliver it to a specific outer membrane receptor,
HasR, for subsequent internalization.,,

HasA hemophores from Serratia marcescens (HasAsm),,Pseudomonas aeruginosa (HasAp),, and Yersinia pestis (HasAyp) have been structurally
characterized in their heme-free (apo) and heme-bound (holo) forms.
The structures of HasAp, HasAyp, and HasAsm are
composed of an “α-helix wall” packed against a
“β-sheet wall” and two extended loops that bridge
the α-helix and β-sheet walls. The heme iron of HasAp
and HasAsm is coordinated by Tyr75 and His32, with each
axial ligand harbored in distinct loops, termed the Y75 and H32 loops,
respectively (Figure A). This combination
of axial ligands has been observed only in hemoglobin M Saskatoon, hemoglobins from invertebrates,, and heme d1 in cytochrome cd1 reductase, whereas examples
of heme proteins that utilize Tyr as the only protein-provided ligand,
which include hemoglobins M, methemalbumin, catalase, HasAyp, Isd hemophores secreted by
Gram-positive organisms, and heme-binding
periplasmic binding proteins,, are relatively more
abundant. The main difference between apo- and holo-HasAp (or HasAsm) is a large reorganization of the H32 loop, which relocates
the His32 side chain approximately 30 Å (Figure B). The role played by His32 in heme binding has been investigated
using the H32A mutant of HasAp., The X-ray crystal structure
of the holo form revealed a noncrystallographic dimer linked by cofacial
interaction of two heme molecules, which are coordinated by Tyr75;
each subunit is nearly identical in structure to the apoprotein, including
the open conformation of the H32 loop. These observations suggested
that heme loads onto the Y75 loop while the H32 loop is in the open
(apo-like) conformation. Subsequent closure of the H32 loop in wild-type
(wt) HasAp excludes water from the heme environment and provides the
sixth ligand to the heme. This idea found
additional support in the structure of monomeric H32A holo-HasAp in
complex with imidazole, which revealed the heme iron coordinated by
Tyr75 and an exogenous imidazole. While the H32 loop is not completely
defined in the imidazole complex, segments with clearly discernible
electron density indicate a closed loop conformation similar to that
seen in wt holo-HasAp. Moreover, the plane of the coordinated imidazole
in H32A holo-HasAp is nearly superimposable with the His32 imidazole
plane in wt HasAp. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies
of H32A holo-HasAp and its imidazole complex provided corroborating
evidence that loading of hemin on the Y75 loop triggers closure of
the H32 loop, even in the absence of the His32 side chain.

HasA hemophores display structural conservation of the
proximal
loop (coral) but divergence in the structure and function of the distal
loop (green). Structures of (A) apo-HasAp [Protein Data Bank (PDB)
entry 3MOK]
and (B) holo-HasAp (PDB entry 3ELL) illustrate the large conformational
rearrangement of the distal loop (green) caused by heme binding, which
results in heme axial ligation by His32 and Tyr75. In contrast, the
structures of (C) apo-HasAyp (PDB entry 4JER) and (D) holo-HasAyp (PDB entry 4JET) illustrate the minimal reorganization of the distal loop upon heme
binding and the coordination of heme by only one protein-provided
ligand, Tyr75. The Cl– ion that coordinates to the
distal site is shown as a yellow sphere.

Kinetic studies of binding of heme to wt apo-HasAp using
rapid
mixing techniques coupled to electronic absorption, electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR), and resonance Raman spectroscopic methods identified
two distinct kinetic phases. The spectroscopic
changes in the first phase, which is complete within 20 ms, are indicative
of efficient loading of heme onto the Y75 loop, while the slower phase,
which lasts ≈1 s at 4 °C, reflects closure of the H32
loop and coordination of the heme iron by His32; accordingly, the
H32A variant exhibits only the first millisecond phase corresponding
to the loading of hemin onto the Y75 loop. Taken together, our structural and kinetic investigations clearly
demonstrate that hemin loads onto the Y75 loop within a few milliseconds,
where it is coordinated by Y75, and triggers closure of the H32 loop
and coordination of the heme on a time scale of seconds. A recent
study conducted with the H32A mutant of HasAsm produced
a similar model for heme loading.

Amino acid sequence alignments of HasA proteins from Yersinia species show conservation of Tyr75 and His83
in the Y75 loop, but no conservation of His32. Structural characterization of HasA from Y. pestis, apo- and holo-HasAyp, where residue 32 is a glutamine,
led to three important observations. (i) The Gln32-bearing loop adopts
a closed conformation in apo-HasAyp (Figure C). (ii) Tyr75 is the only endogenous heme ligand in holo-HasAyp. (iii) Binding of heme to apo-HasAyp occurs on
a submillisecond time scale with minimal structural reorganization
(Figure D). This
study of HasAyp highlights variations in the coordination
state of hemin in HasA hemophores, but it also underscores a strong
structural conservation of the proximal loop, which includes the invariant
Tyr75 ligand and its hydrogen bond partner, His81 (Figure ). The function of this hydrogen bond, which is
thought to enhance the phenolate character of Tyr75, has been proposed
to be essential for proximal hemin coordination by Tyr75.,, A low-resolution crystal structure
of H83A holo-HasAsm has been reported, but poor electron
density did not permit the determination of whether Tyr75 remains
coordinated to the heme iron in H83A holo-HasAsm. Resonance Raman and NMR spectroscopic studies,
however, led the same authors to suggest that in the absence of His83
the Tyr75–Fe bond is severed. Thus, the H83A mutant of HasAsm was described as a five-coordinate species, with His32 as
the only axial ligand at pH 5.2, His32 and water as axial ligands
at neutral pH, and His32 and a hydroxide ligand at basic pH. A different study proposed that in the absence
of Tyr75, His83 likely acts as a heme iron ligand,, but direct experimental support for this notion is lacking.

Given the structural conservation of the Y75 loop in HasA hemophores,
and the proposed requirement for the His83–Tyr75 unit for coordination
of hemin by Tyr75, we conducted a structural and spectroscopic characterization
of the Y75A and H83A HasAp mutants. Our high-resolution crystal structures
of H83A HasAp clearly demonstrate that in the absence of His83, the
Tyr75 ligand remains coordinated to the heme iron at neutral pH and
at pH 5.4. These structures also show that in the absence of the His83
side chain, a water molecule can substitute for the missing Nδ atom of His83 to interact with the Oη atom of Tyr75 and aid its coordination to the ferric heme iron.
NMR spectroscopic studies conducted with Y75A and H83A apo-HasAp demonstrate
that disruption of the Tyr75–His83 hydrogen bond induces significant
conformational disorder in the Y75 loop, which propagates into neighboring
elements of secondary structure. Stopped-flow UV–vis absorption
and rapid-freeze-quench resonance Raman (RFQ-RR) analyses of the binding
of hemin to Y75A and H83A apo-HasAp show biphasic kinetics comparable
to those observed in wt HasAp. These results suggest that the importance
of hemin iron axial ligation in the process of the acquisition of
hemin by HasAp should not be overestimated and point toward noncovalent
interactions as factors dominating heme capture and the formation
of holo-HasAp.

Experimental Procedures
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Y75A and H83A HasAp mutants
were constructed in the background of the gene encoding the truncated
form of HasAp missing the last 21 C′-terminal residues. Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies,
Inc., and were used without further purification in conjunction with
the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA). Primers used to install the Y75A mutation were 5′-GGCGGCGATCTGCATGCGACCCTGTTT-3′
and 5′-GCTAAACAGGGTCGCATGCAGATCGCCGCC-3′
and those use for the H83A mutation 5′-CTGTTTAGCAACCCGAGCGCGACCCTGTGGGGC-3′
and 5′-GCCCCACAGGGTCGCGCTCGGGTTGCTAAACAG-3′,
where the underlined codons represent target substitutions. Each gene
construct was transformed into XL1-Blue competent cells (Stratagene)
for amplification, and the DNA sequence was verified by SeqWright
(Houston, TX). The recombinant DNA plasmid with the correct sequence
was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-GOLD(DE3)
competent cells for subsequent protein expression.

Protein Expression
and Purification
Expression, purification,
and reconstitution of Y75A and H83A HasAp with heme were conducted
using previously described methods. The
oligomeric state of the mutant hemophores was determined with the
aid of a gel filtration column (Superdex 75 prep grade, GE Healthcare),
calibrated with cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), chymotrypsin
(25 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa) standards, in 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl buffer. The preparation of wt, Y75A,
and H83A HasAp uniformly labeled with 15N ([U-15N]HasAp, [U-15N]Y75A HasAp, and [U-15N]H83A
HasAp) or labeled with both 15N and 13C (wt
[U-13C,U-15N]HasAp, Y75A [U-13C,U-15N]HasAp, and H83A [U-13C,U-15N]HasAp)
was performed as previously described for wt and H32A HasAp.

Crystallization and Data Collection
HasAp mutants in
100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8) (Y75A) or 100 mM Tris (pH 7.6) (H83A)
were concentrated to 15 mg/mL and screened for crystal growth at 20
°C using Compact Jr. (Emerald biosystems) sitting drop vapor
diffusion plates. Equal volumes of protein and crystallization solution
were equilibrated against a 100 μL reservoir volume. Crystals
of Y75A HasAp were obtained within 24 h from Crystal Screen 2 (Hampton
Research) condition #32 [1.6 M (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), and 200 mM NaCl]. Crystals were transferred
to a solution containing an 80% crystallization solution and 20% glycerol
before being frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Crystals
of H83A HasAp were obtained from three distinct conditions. (1) Wizard
II (Emerald biosystems) condition #11 [10% 2-propanol, 100 mM sodium
cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 200 mM zinc acetate] produced nondiffracting
small crystals that grew as clusters of small needles in approximately
24 h at 20 °C. Refinement of the crystallization conditions was
conducted using the Hampton Additive screen (Hampton Research). Plate-shaped
clusters that diffracted to high resolution were obtained from 10%
2-propanol, 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 200 mM zinc acetate,
and 3% dioxane. These crystals were transferred to a solution containing
a 75% crystallization solution and 25% ethylene glycol before being
frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. (2) Crystals were obtained
in approximately 3 days at 20 °C from Hampton Crystal Screen
2 condition #23 [1.6 M (NH4)2SO4,
100 mM MES (pH 6.5), and 10% dioxane]. Crystals were transferred to
a solution containing an 80% crystallization solution and 20% ethylene
glycol before being frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection.
(3) Crystals were obtained in approximately 3 days at 20 °C from
1.6 M (NH4)2SO4, 100 mM MES (pH 5.4),
and 10% dioxane. Samples were transferred to a solution containing
an 80% crystallization solution and 20% ethylene glycol before being
frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. High-resolution diffraction
data from all crystals were acquired at Advanced Photon Source IMCA-CAT
beamline 17ID using a Dectris Pilatus 6M pixel array detector.

Structure
Solution and Refinement
Diffraction intensities
were integrated and scaled using XDS and
Scala, respectively, and the Laue class
was checked using Pointless. Coordinates
from the structure of wt HasAp [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3ELL] were used for molecular
replacement with Molrep searching for
a single molecule in the asymmetric unit for all data sets. Structural
refinement of positional and anisotropic atomic displacement parameters
and manual model building for both mutants were performed with Phenix and Coot, respectively.
Structure validation was conducted using Molprobity, and figures were prepared using CCP4mg and PyMol (http://www.pymol.org). Data collection
and refinement statistics are summarized in Table .

Rmerge = ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) – ⟨I(hkl)⟩|/∑hkl∑iIi(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is
the intensity measured for the ith reflection and
⟨I(hkl)⟩ is the average
intensity of all reflections with indices hkl.

Rfactor = ∑hkl||Fobs(hkl)| – |Fcalc(hkl)||/∑hkl|Fobs(hkl)|. Rfree is calculated in an identical manner using
5% of the randomly selected reflections that were not included in
the refinement.

Rmeas is the redundancy-independent (multiplicity-weighted) Rmerge.,Rpim is the precision-indicating (multiplicity-weighted) Rmerge.,

Y75A HasAp
Following initial refinement,
prominent
difference (Fobs – Fcalc) electron density was observed near the heme on the
side that would normally be occupied by Tyr75. Three peaks were present
in this region that were at an angle of approximately 120° and
separated by approximately 1.3 Å. Refinement with an ethanol
molecule at this site resulted in positive Fobs – Fcalc electron density
at the C2 atom of ethanol, indicating an underestimation
of electrons, whereas placement of a formate ion did not yield any
residual electron density. Similar electron density was observed from
four diffraction data sets ranging from 0.95 to 1.30 Å resolution
obtained from four unique crystallization conditions: Hampton Crystal
Screen 2 condition #23 described above, Hampton Crystal Screen 2 condition
#32 [1.6 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5), and 0.1 M sodium
chloride], Hampton Crystal Screen 2 condition #42 [1.5 M ammonium
sulfate, 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5), and 12% (v/v) glycerol], and Hampton
Crystal Screen 1 condition #38 [1.4 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate
and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5)]. Herein, we report only the 0.95 Å
resolution data obtained with Crystal screen 2 condition #23. Because
the electron density was not consistent with any of the crystallization
components, protein storage buffer, or purification buffers, it is
likely that the formate ion was present in the heme used in the reconstitution
of the apoprotein.

H83A HasAp
Condition 1 produced
a monoclinic crystal
form, henceforth termed H83Amono. Molecular replacement
searches in space groups P21 and P2 produced correlation coefficients of 0.62 and 0.30, respectively.
Therefore, subsequent structural refinement was conducted in space
group P21. Initial structure solution
and refinement were conducted using in-house diffraction data collected
with Cu Kα radiation. Large peaks greater than 10σ were
observed in the difference Fourier maps (Fobs – Fcalc) that were tentatively
assigned as zinc ions from the crystallization solution. No anomalous
signal was observed at these sites using Cu Kα data. An X-ray
fluorescence scan indicated that zinc was indeed present in the crystal.
Consequently, data for structural refinement were collected at a wavelength
of 1.0000 Å, which still yields an appreciable anomalous signal
for Zn ∼ 2.6e–. In addition,
diffraction data were collected at a low-energy remote wavelength
(λ = 1.28414 Å, 9655 eV), which resulted in the disappearance
of the anomalous difference density at the Zn sites but an increase
at the heme Fe site. Condition 2 produced an orthorhombic crystal
form (H83Aortho), and condition 3 produced crystals at
pH 5.4 (H83ApH5.4), which were obtained from attempts to
grow crystals in a pH range of 5.0–5.5, to explore the ligation
state of Tyr75 under acidic conditions. The structure was determined
as described above for H83Aortho.

NMR Spectroscopy
Sequential backbone assignments of
wt apo-HasAp were obtained at 32 °C with the aid of two- and
three-dimensional NMR experiments [1H–15N HSQC, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH] conducted in a Varian
Unity Inova 600 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance
probe. Given that the 1H–15N HSQC spectra
of Y75A and H83A apo-HasAp are very similar to that of wt apo-HasAp,
sequential backbone assignments for the two mutants were obtained
at 32 °C with the aid of 1H–15N
HSQC, HNCA, and HN(CO)CA experiments conducted in a Bruker Avance
800 spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm TCI 1H/13C/15N cryoprobe. Protein samples for three-dimensional
NMR data acquisition were in phosphate buffer (20 mM, 95% H2O, 5% D2O, pH 7.0) at concentrations ranging between 2.5
and 5.0 mM. Two- and three-dimensional NMR spectra were processed
using NMRPipe and analyzed with Sparky.1H chemical shifts were referenced
to the proton reference of DSS at 0 ppm, while 15N and 13C shifts were referenced indirectly using ratios of 0.101329118
and 0.251449530, respectively. The effect
of temperature on the 1H–15N HSQC spectra
of wt and mutant proteins was determined in a 600 MHz Bruker Avance
III spectrometer equipped with an inverse H/C/N triple-resonance probe,
using samples with concentrations in the range of 1.0–1.7 mM.

RR and EPR Spectroscopy
RR spectra were recorded using
a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67 m with variable gratings)
equipped with a Princeton Instruments liquid N2-cooled
CCD detector (LN-1100PB). Excitation at 406 nm was provided by a krypton
laser (Innova 302, Coherent), and a Kaiser Optical supernotch filter
was used to attenuate Rayleigh scattering. Off-Soret excitations were
provided by an argon laser (Innova 90, Coherent). Spectra at room
temperature were recorded in a 90° scattering geometry on samples
mounted on a reciprocating translation stage. Frequencies were calibrated
relative to indene and CCl4 and are accurate to ±1
cm–1. CCl4 was also used to check the
polarization conditions. The integrity of the RR samples, before and
after laser illumination, was confirmed by direct monitoring of their
UV–vis spectra in the Raman capillaries. Low-temperature spectra
were recorded in a backscattering geometry on samples maintained at
∼105 K in a liquid nitrogen coldfinger. Frequencies were calibrated
relative to aspirin and are accurate to ±1 cm–1. Sodium selenate (Sigma) was chosen as an internal standard and added at a final concentration of 100 mM
to 500 μM samples of Y75A and H83A holo-HasAp, to determine
their relative resonance enhancement based on the ν4 intensity at 406 nm excitation and 105 K. EPR spectra of holo-HasAp
variants were recorded on a Bruker E500 X-band EPR spectrometer equipped
with a superX microwave bridge and a dual-mode cavity and a helium-flow
cryostat (ESR 900, Oxford Instruments, Inc.). Quantitation of the
EPR signals was performed at 8 K under nonsaturating conditions by
double integration and comparison with Cu(II)-EDTA standards.

Stopped-Flow
UV–Vis Spectroscopy
Stopped-flow
experiments were performed with an SX20 stopped-flow UV–vis
spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) with a 1 cm path length cell equilibrated
at 4 °C. Solutions of apo-HasAp variants in 200 mM HEPES buffer
(pH 7.0) were prepared, and their concentrations were calculated as
previously described on the basis of a 280 nm molar extinction coefficient
(ε280) of 27.13 mM–1 cm–1 for both variants. The apoproteins were diluted to yield concentrations
ranging from ∼40 to 400 μM in the same buffer. Hemin
was dissolved in 1 mM NaOH and diluted to a final concentration of
10 μM just before the stopped-flow experiments using an ε385 of 58.4 mM–1 cm–1.
After each measurement, remaining premixed solutions were recovered
from the stopped-flow apparatus to confirm the protein and hemin concentrations.
Control experiments using 1:1 mixtures of a hemin solution and buffer
were run to confirm that the UV–vis spectrum of hemin remains
unchanged during the course of stopped-flow experiments. Complete
sets of time-resolved spectra were examined by global analysis using
a Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm (Pro-K software, Applied Photophysics),
which results in pseudo-first-order rate constants k1obs and k2obs. The reported
rate constants are from global analyses and are the average of at
least three different rapid mixing experiments.

Rapid-Freeze-Quench
Experiments
Our protocol for the
preparation of RFQ samples was described in detail recently. Glass syringes (2 mL) were loaded with 0.6 mM
apo-HasAp variants in 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) and a 0.6 mM hemin solution
in 10 mM NaOH before being mounted on a System 1000 Chemical/Freeze
Quench Apparatus (Update Instruments) equipped with a water bath maintained
at 4 °C. Reaction times were controlled by varying the syringe
displacement rate from 2 to 8 cm/s or by varying the length of the
reactor hose after the mixer. Five milliseconds was added to the calculated
reaction times to account for the time of flight and the freezing
time in liquid ethane. Mixed samples (250 μL) were trapped in
liquid ethane at or below −120 °C in glass funnels attached
to NMR tubes. The frozen samples were packed into the tube as the
assembly sat within a Teflon block cooled to −120 °C with
liquid nitrogen. Liquid ethane was subsequently removed by incubating
samples at −80 °C for 2 h. RR analyses before and after
cryosolvent removal showed no spectral changes except for the loss
of ethane bands. End point samples were generated by collecting reaction
mixtures in NMR tubes at room temperature before they were frozen
in liquid ethane.

Results
Y75A and H83A Holo-HasAp
Mutants Adopt a Monomeric Structure
in Solution
As is the case for wt HasAp, the bacterial expression
of Y75A and H83A HasAp results in accumulation of a much larger proportion
of apo hemophore relative to its holo counterpart in the E.
coli host cells. Hence, the two mutants were purified in
their apo form using a previously reported protocol, which utilizes
hydrophobic affinity chromatography to separate apo and holo hemophores. The holo hemophore was prepared from its corresponding
apo form by heme reconstitution in vitro, as described
in . Sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that both
mutant proteins migrate with apparent masses of ∼19 kDa. Mass
values measured with the aid of ESI-MS are 18667 Da (Y75A) and 18693
Da (H83A), which are in good agreement with the molecular masses calculated
from amino acid sequences, 18668 Da (Y75A) and 18694 Da (H83A). The
apparent molecular masses of Y75A and H83A determined by size exclusion
chromatography are 16.9 and 17.6 kDa, respectively, indicating that
both mutant proteins are monomeric in solution (Figure S1 of the ).

Like wt Holo-HasAp, the
Y75A and H83A Variants Exist as Six-Coordinate
High-Spin–Low-Spin Equilibrium Mixtures
Figure  shows the electronic absorption spectra of wt (black),
Y75A (red), and H83A (blue) HasAp. The UV–vis absorption spectrum
of Y75A exhibits a Soret peak at 407 nm and a characteristic high-spin
marker charge transfer band at 624 nm. Intense Q bands at 535 and
568 nm also support the presence of a low-spin contribution. This
high-spin–low-spin equilibrium is consistent with axial coordination
that includes a His side chain and an exogenous ligand as revealed
by the X-ray crystal structure of Y75A holo-HasAp (see below). The
UV–vis spectrum of H83A is primarily indicative of a high-spin
conformation at room temperature with a broader Soret band at 405
nm, Q bands at 489 and 550 nm, and a high-spin marker band at 608
nm (Figure ). UV–vis spectra recorded
at low temperatures confirm that the low-spin conformation becomes
dominant below 100 K (Figure S2 of the ).

Room-temperature UV–vis spectra of wt, Y75A, and
H83A holo-HasAp.

The room-temperature
RR spectrum of Y75A is characteristic of a
mixture of six-coordinate high-spin (6cHS) and six-coordinate low-spin
(6cLS) hemes with ν3 and ν2 at 1479
and 1560 cm–1, and 1505 and 1579 cm–1, respectively (Figure A). Observed frequencies
and intensity ratios between 6cHS and 6cLS bands in the RR spectrum
of Y75A differ from those of the wt protein, but qualitatively, the
RR spectra of Y75A are comparable to those of the wt protein. The
RR spectra of H83A confirm the presence of a 6cHS–6cLS temperature-dependent
equilibrium, with the 6cHS configuration, ν3, ν2, and ν10 at 1477, 1561, and 1605 cm–1, respectively, dominating at room temperature and
6cLS contributions beginning to prevail at 110 K (Figure B). Accordingly, the EPR spectra of Y75A and H83A
holo-HasAp recorded at 8 K show rhombic signatures with resonances
centered around g = 2 as expected for S = 1/2 low-spin ferric heme species (Figure C).

The Crystal Structures of Y75A, H83A, and wt Holo-HasAp Are
Highly Homologous
The structure of Y75A holo-HasAp was refined
using data diffracting to 0.95 Å resolution (Table ). Crystals of H83A HasAp were obtained from three different
conditions (see ),
and the corresponding structures were refined using data diffracting
to 0.89 Å (H83Aortho), 1.32 Å (H83Amono), and 1.25 Å (H83ApH5.4) resolution. The overall
structure of the mutants is nearly identical to that of wt holo-HasAp
(Figure  and Figure S3 of the ). It is noteworthy that
in the H83A mutant, Tyr75 remains coordinated to the heme iron in
both structures obtained at pH 6.5 (Figure C and Figure S3A of the ) as well as in the structure obtained at pH 5.4 (Figure S3C of the ). In the Y75A HasAp structure
(Figure B), His83 remains in the position
it occupies in the wt protein and therefore does not coordinate the
heme iron. In the H83Amono structure, the hairpin loop
adjoining β6 and β7 is disordered, as suggested by the
absence of electron density, which is demarcated by asterisks in Figure C. In the H83Aortho structure, strand
β8 is shorter than in the wt protein (Figure S3A of the ). Surprisingly, although
both mutations are on the Y75 loop, the conformation of the H32 loop
is significantly more affected than the conformation of the Y75 loop. This is illustrated in Figure , which depicts the conformational changes affecting the backbone
and side chains of residues in the H32 loop of H83A HasAp (cyan) and
Y75A HasAp (green) relative to their conformations in wt HasAp (magenta).
In contrast, the structure of the Y75 loop remains nearly unchanged
relative to the Y75 loop in wt HasAp. Note, however, that despite
the conformational changes in the H32 loop, the coordinated imidazole
rings of His32 in the wt and mutant proteins are identical, as is
the seating of the heme.

Overall structure of the Y75A and H83A mutants
that is very similar
to that of wt HasAp (PDB entry 3ELL). The Cα root-mean-square
deviations (rmsds) from comparing the wild-type structure (A) to the
structure of Y75A HasAp (B) is 0.571 Å, and that from comparing
the wild-type structure to the structure of H83Amono HasAp
(C) is 0.448 Å. Secondary structures are colored cyan (α-helices),
magenta (β-strands), and gray (loops). Residues Ser2–Ala183
were used to calculate the rmsds using the secondary structure matching
algorithm in Superpose via the CCP4 interface.

Replacing Tyr75 or His83 in the Y75 loop of HasAp with a noncoordinating
Ala causes conformational changes in the His32 loop. Close-up views
of the H32 (top) and Y75 (bottom) loops of H83A HasAp (cyan) and Y75A
HasAp (green) superposed with the structure of wt HasAp (magenta).

Heme binds to the Y75A HasAp mutant
in a single orientation, which
is evident from the Fobs – Fcalc electron density map in Figure A. Given that the heme seating is also identical
to that observed in wt HasAp, it allows similar interactions between
the heme propionates and Gly35 and Arg129 (Figure S4 of the ). Prominent difference
electron density (Fobs – Fcalc) was observed near the heme on the side
that would normally be occupied by Tyr75 in the wt protein. Structure
refinement with an ethanol molecule at this site resulted in positive Fobs – Fcalc electron density at the C2 atom of ethanol, indicating
an underestimation of electrons. Placement of a formate ion at this
site did not yield residual electron density upon refinement; thus,
a formate ion was modeled at this site. It is noteworthy that the
same electron density was observed in four distinct diffraction data
sets ranging in resolution from 0.95 to 1.3 Å, which were obtained
from four different crystallization conditions (see ). Herein, we report only the structure
obtained from crystals diffracting to 0.95 Å resolution. Given
that the protein is initially purified in its apo form and then reconstituted
with heme in vitro, we surmise that the most likely
source of formate stems from the heme or the dimethyl sulfoxide used
to dissolve heme for the heme reconstitution experiments. The plane
of the modeled formate ion is aligned with the heme α–γ-meso
axis, which allows one of the formate oxygen atoms to coordinate the
heme and also form a hydrogen bond with Nδ of His83
(2.6 Å). This hydrogen bonding interaction is similar to the
hydrogen bond formed in the wt protein between the coordinated phenolic
oxygen of Tyr75 and Nδ of His83. The second oxygen
in the formate molecule interacts with the backbone carbonyl group
of Thr76 (3.8 Å). The side chain of His83, which also displays
very well-defined electron density, is placed in a position identical
to the position it occupies in the wt protein, where it does not coordinate
the heme iron.

3σ are shown as blue mesh. FMT denotes the formate ion and EG
ethylene glycol. The Zn2+ ion in panel C is shown as a
sphere.

Tyr75 and His32 axially coordinate
the heme iron in the H83Aortho (Figure B), H83Amono (Figure C),
and H83ApH5.4 (Figure D) structures.
The Fobs – Fcalc electron density maps
show that both axial ligands exhibit very well-defined electron density
in all structures, as does the heme, which is bound to the protein
in a single orientation, thus clearly demonstrating that Tyr75 remains
coordinated to the heme iron, even at pH 5.4. The seating of the heme
is the same in all three structures and identical to that observed
in wt HasAp, although the heme propionates adopt different conformations
in the three structures (also see Figure S4 of the ). In all structures, Tyr75 coordinates
the heme iron in a conformation identical to that seen in wt HasAp.
In addition to coordinating the heme iron, the phenolic oxygen of
Tyr75 forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule in the H83Aortho (Figure B) and H83ApH5.4 structures (Figure D), or with the oxygen
atom of an adventitious ethylene glycol (used as a cryoprotectant)
in the H83Amono structure (Figure C). These hydrogen bonding interactions experienced by Tyr75 in the
H83A mutant effectively replace the Tyr75 Oη···His83
Nδ hydrogen bond seen in wt HasAp. These observations
are in agreement with the significance of the hydrogen bond between
Tyr75 and His83 in allowing coordination of Tyr75 to the heme iron., Importantly, however, our finding that Tyr75 coordinates the heme
in all available structures is in contrast with conclusions derived
from spectroscopic studies suggesting that the Tyr–Fe bond
is severed in the H83A mutant of HasAsm.,

During refinement of the H83Amono structure, large
peaks
greater than 10σ were observed in the Fobs – Fcalc maps, which
were tentatively attributed to zinc ions from the crystallization
solution. No anomalous signal was observed at these sites using diffraction
data from Cu Kα X-rays. An X-ray fluorescence scan at the synchrotron
indicated that zinc was indeed present in the crystal (Figure S5A
of the ). Hence,
data for structural refinement that were collected at a wavelength
of 1.0000 Å yielded an appreciable anomalous signal for Zn. In
contrast, diffraction data collected at a low-energy remote wavelength
(1.28414 Å), which resulted in the disappearance of the anomalous
difference density at the Zn sites and increased the magnitude of
the anomalous signal at the heme iron site, confirmed the presence
of Zn (Figure S5B of the ). One of the zinc ions interacts with the heme propionates, which
induces a conformation distinct from that observed for the heme propionates
in wt HasAp. In the H83ApH5.4 structure, heme propionate
6 interacts with the side chain of Arg129 and thus adopts a conformation
similar to that in the wt protein. In contrast, heme propionate 7
adopts a different conformation, which places the carboxylate group
within hydrogen bonding distance of the backbone NH and CO groups
of Arg33, Gly35, and Val37 (Figure S4E of the ).

Y75A and H83A Apo-HasAp
Have Disordered Y75 Loops
The
X-ray crystal structures of Y75A and H83A holo-HasAp indicate minimal
changes in the structure of the Y75 loop and small changes in the
H32 loop relative to those of the wt protein. Despite considerable
effort, however, we were unable to grow crystals of Y75A or H83A apo-HasAp.
We hypothesized that conformational disorder in the apoproteins may
prevent crystal growth; thus, we conducted NMR spectroscopic studies
in solution aimed at probing disorder in the apoproteins. A suite
of five experiments (see ) allowed sequential backbone assignments for 93% of non-proline
residues in wt apo-HasAp (Table S1 of the ). Chemical shift indexing of Cα chemical shifts was used to identify elements
of secondary structure in solution, which were found to be consistent
with elements of secondary structure observed in the crystal structure
of wt apo-HasAp (Figure S6A of the ). The 1H–15N HSQC
spectrum of each of the mutant apoproteins, with the exception of
a few cross-peaks, can be nearly superimposed with the HSQC spectrum
of wt apo-HasAp (Figure S7 of the ), which indicates that overall, the structures of the mutant apo
hemophores are similar to the structure of wt apo-HasAp. Given the
high degree of similarity in the HSQC spectra of wt and mutant proteins,
the sequential backbone assignments of Y75A and H83A apo-HasAp were
obtained relatively readily (Tables S2 and S3, respectively, of the ). Plots comparing Cα chemical shift indexes of wt and mutant proteins (Figure
S6 of the ) also
demonstrate that neither the Y75A mutation nor the H83A mutation caused
significant changes in the structure of the apoproteins.

Closer
inspection of the HSQC spectra shows mostly small differences in the
weighed chemical shifts (Δδweighed) obtained
from comparing the chemical shifts of cross-peaks in Y75A apo-HasAp
(Figure A) or H83A apo-HasAp (Figure B) with corresponding cross-peaks in wt apo-HasAp.
Importantly, the comparison also reveals that several cross-peaks
in the spectra of the mutants (i) are missing (red triangles in Figure ), (ii) are broadened and have intensities significantly
lower than those of their counterparts in the spectrum of wt HasAp
(blue squares), or (iii) are split (green diamonds). In addition,
some of the affected resonances exhibit pronounced changes in intensity,
split farther apart, or disappear with changes in temperature. An
example is shown in Figure S8 of the , where the two cross-peaks originating from G128
(α2) in Y75A apo-HasAp become progressively more separated as
the temperature is lowered from 32 to 15 °C. In comparison, G128
in the wt protein gives rise to a unique cross-peak at all temperatures.
The observations described above indicate that the corresponding residues
in the mutant apoproteins are indeed affected by conformational disorder.
Mapping the missing, broadened, and split cross-peaks in the spectra
of the mutants onto the X-ray crystal structure of wt apo-HasAp using
the same color scheme as in the plots (Figure ) reveals that the Y75 loop, the neighboring α2 helix, some
of the β-strands near the loop, and a portion of the distal
loop emerging from β2 are affected by conformational disorder
in both mutants.

whose cross-peaks disappear are denoted with red triangles; residues
whose cross-peaks split are denoted with green diamonds, and residues
whose cross-peaks are broadened and have decreased intensity are denoted
with blue squares. These residues have been mapped on the wt apo-HasAp

The Y75A and H83A Apo-HasAp
Variants Conserve the Characteristic
Biphasic Kinetics of Hemin Loading Observed in the wt Protein
As previously described for wt apo-HasAp, the stopped-flow absorption data of the acquisition of hemin by
the Y75A and H83A variants correspond to a biphasic process. The stopped-flow
traces obtained with Y75A are very similar to those observed with
wt HasAp as they reveal a millisecond intermediate species with Soret,
Q, and high-spin CT bands at 403, 498, and 620 nm, respectively (Figure  and Figure S9 of the ). Low-spin Q bands at 535 and 568 nm begin to grow
∼20 ms after mixing at 4 °C. The H83A variant also reveals
the formation of a high-spin intermediate with Soret, Q, and high-spin
CT bands at 397, 496, 532, and 616 nm (Figure S9 of the ). After completion of
this first millisecond phase, the UV–vis spectra further evolve
to new predominantly high-spin components at 405, 489, 550, and 608
nm (Figure ).

association of 4.7 μM
hemin with (A) Y75A and (B) H83A apo-HasAp at 60 μM. Red and
black traces are representative of early and late phases of the reaction,
respectively; the blue traces are hemin/buffer controls. Also shown
are plots of observed rate constants vs apo-HasAp concentration.

In previous work, we analyzed the
biphasic behavior of loading of hemin to wt apo-HasAp with a multistep
model, in which formation of a reversible hemin–apoprotein
complex proceeds quickly before slower iron(III) coordination steps
begin to take place:Assuming that k1[apo-HasAp] and k–1 ≫ kcoord1 and kcoord1 ≫ kcoord2 produces eq :This model explains the hyperbolic
dependence of k1obs on the apo-HasAp concentration.
In contrast, k2obs shows no dependence
on the apo-HasAp concentration, as expected for an intramolecular
reaction that corresponds to the closure of the H32 loop and coordination
of the iron by His32.

This same analysis was used to extract Kd, kcoord1, and kcoord2 values from the stopped-flow data obtained
with the
variant proteins (Table ). The Y75A substitution
results in a 4-fold higher Kd value without
a significant change in the rate of the first coordination step, kcoord1. The second kinetic phase reflects kcoord2 and is ∼3 times faster in Y75A
than in wt HasAp, but it remains low, i.e., in the millisecond time
scale expected for a significant protein loop rearrangement (Table ).

Kinetic Parameters
for the Binding
of Hemin to wt and Mutant HasAp Proteins at 4 °C
 	wt	H32A	Y75A	H83A	
Kd (μM)	35	61	129	30	
kcoord1 (s–1)	552	830	539	118	
kcoord2 (s–1)	5.2	n.o.	14.4	20.5	
The k1obs values for H83A apo-HasAp
also follow a hyperbolic dependence on apoprotein concentration as
seen with the Y75A variant, but the curve for H83A rises more quickly
and achieves a lower plateau, indicating lower values of Kd and kcoord1 (Figure ). Compared to those of wt HasAp, the H83A substitution
does not appear to change the Kd value
but does decrease kcoord1 5-fold. In contrast,
the kcoord2 value is increased ∼4-fold
in the H83A variant compared to that of wt HasAp (Table ). In addition to kinetic rates, the global fitting analyses
provide electronic absorption spectra of the millisecond intermediates
in individual proteins (Figure S9 of the ). These computed spectra suggest that distinct
high-spin heme–protein intermediate complexes form in Y75A,
H83A, and wt HasAp.

The Millisecond Intermediate in Y75A Is Likely
Coordinated by
His83, while in H83A, Y75 Is the Likely Axial Ligand to the Hemin
Iron
Rapid-freeze-quench resonance Raman (RFQ-RR) experiments
were performed in an effort to characterize the millisecond intermediate
heme–protein complexes in Y75A and H83A HasAp. The high-frequency
RR spectrum of the 6 ms RFQ sample of Y75A shows porphyrin modes indicative
of a mixture of 5cHS and 6cHS species with ν3 modes
at 1492 and 1481 cm–1, respectively (Figure A). High-spin heme iron(III) species with O atom
axial coordination typically exhibit ν3 modes that
are intense relative to the ν4 and ν2 modes,− and the high ν3/ν4, ν2 intensity ratio observed in the RFQ-RR spectra of the millisecond
intermediate formed in wt HasAp supported the notion that Y75 is the
first coordinating ligand to the iron(III). In contrast, the RR spectra of the 6 ms samples of Y75A show ν3 modes that are weak relative to the ν2 and
ν4 modes, which suggest that the initial coordination
to the iron(III) involves an endogenous ligand, presumably His83,
rather than a solvent molecule. Over time, these high-spin contributions
are replaced by 6cLS modes with ν3 and ν2 at 1505 and 1582 cm–1, respectively. On
the basis of the crystal structure of Y75A holo-HasAp, we assign this
transition to the closure of the H32 loop on the heme pocket and intercalation
of a solvent molecule between the heme iron(III) and His83.

High-frequency
RR spectra of RFQ samples of the reaction of 1 equiv
of hemin with (A) Y75A apo-HasAp and (B) H83A apo-HasAp (protein concentration
after mixing of 300 μM and excitation wavelength of 406 nm;
all spectra are normalized to the intensity of the ν4 feature observed between 1371 and 1377 cm–1).

The high-frequency RR spectra
of the 6 ms RFQ sample of H83A exhibit
ν4, ν3, and ν2 modes
at 1374, 1493, and 1572 cm–1, respectively, that
are characteristic of a pure 5cHS species with an O atom axial ligand;
they are analogous to but spectrally distinguishable from free hemin
(Figure B). These 5cHS porphyrin skeletal
modes are also different from the 5cHS signals observed in the 6 ms
RFQ sample of wt HasAp (Figure S10 of the ). Longer reaction times allow for the conversion
of this five-coordinate complex to a mixture of 6cHS and 6cLS heme
conformers. Attempts to detect vibrational modes involving iron(III)
axial ligands such as tyrosinate modes or ν(Fe–OH) modes
using off-Soret excitation and 18OH2–D2O solvent exchange were unsuccessful for both the Y75A and
H83A variants (data not shown).

Discussion
Y75A and H83A
Substitutions Do Not Affect the Structure of Holo-HasAp
Previous
investigations of the process of loading of hemin onto
HasAp showed that within 20 ms hemin binds first to the Y75 loop.
This rapid process, which is believed to include the coordination
of Tyr75 to the heme iron, is followed by a slower reorganization
of the H32 loop and coordination of the heme by His32, which occurs
within ∼1 s at 4 °C., In contrast
to the large rearrangement of the His32-bearing loop, the Y75 loop
retains its structure in the apo and holo forms of the hemophore.
The structural conservation includes the Tyr75 Oη···His83 Nδ hydrogen bond, which
is thought to play a pivotal role in hemin binding by increasing the
phenolate character of the Tyr75 axial ligand and allowing it to coordinate
the ferric ion in hemin, yet our high-resolution crystal structures
of the Y75A and H83A holo-HasAp mutants are remarkably similar to
that of wt holo-HasAp. In particular, in all three H83A holo-HasAp
structures, the heme iron is coordinated by both His32 and Tyr75 and
the structure of the Y75 loop is unaltered relative to that of wt
holo-HasAp (see Figures  and ). Interestingly, the void left by the His83 to Ala substitution
is filled by a water molecule in the H83Aortho structure
at pH 6.5 and in the structure at pH 5.4, and this crystallographically
defined water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the phenol oxygen of
the coordinated Tyr75. In the H83Amono structure, the same
void is filled with an ethylene glycol molecule that acts as a hydrogen
bond partner to the coordinated Tyr75. It is also noteworthy that
the side chain of Tyr75 remains coordinated to heme, even at pH 5.4,
despite the absence of the His83 side chain. Clearly, these observations
demonstrate that His83 and the Tyr75 Oη···His83
Nδ hydrogen bond are not essential for maintaining
the integrity of the heme-binding pocket in holo-HasAp or the coordination
of hemin iron by Tyr75.

In the Y75A holo-HasAp structure, we
observed well-defined elongated electron density below the hemin iron,
which was modeled as a formate ion (Figure A); as indicated above, the most likely source of this formate ion
is our hemin stock. Nevertheless, the structure of the loop, including
the position of the His83 side chain, can be superimposed with that
observed in the Y75 loop of wt holo-HasAp, suggesting that in the
absence of formate, the heme iron is coordinated to a water molecule
and His32, as has been suggested on the basis of spectroscopic studies
of Y75A holo-HasAsm.

The Y75
Loop Is Partially Disordered in the Variant Apoproteins
In
contrast to the success we experienced growing single crystals
of wt, Y75A, and H83A holo-HasAp, we were unable to grow crystals
of the apo form of these variant proteins despite extensive screening
of conditions. Because we suspected conformational disorder was hindering
crystal growth, we turned to solution NMR and obtained the sequential
backbone assignments of wt, Y75A, and H83A apo-HasAp. As expected,
the NMR spectra of wt apo-HasAp are consistent with a well-ordered
structure, which is in agreement with the well-defined electron density
defining its X-ray crystal structure. The HSQC spectra of Y75A or H83A apo-HasAp are nearly identical
to the HSQC spectrum of their wt counterpart. Detailed inspection,
however, reveals that several cross-peaks corresponding to residues
in the Y75 loop, helix α2, and several β-strands in Y75A
and H83A apo-HasAp are affected by conformational disorder (see Figure ). The crystal structure of wt apo-HasAp (Figure ) shows that Tyr75 and His83 are involved in several
hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions within the loop. Figure A shows the hydrogen bond between the phenol oxygen
of Tyr75 and Nδ of His83, as well as the hydrogen
bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of His83 and the side chains of
Arg129 and His134 in helix α2, and the Leu85 carbonyl···His134
NH hydrogen bond, which mediate interactions between the Y75 loop
and helix α2. Also apparent is a group of hydrophobic interactions
(Figure B) that include the hydrophobic portions
of the Tyr75 and His83 side chains, helix α2 (Met141), strands
β5 (Leu85), β4 (Leu73), β3 (Tyr56), and β2
(Phe46), and the hairpin loop connecting strands β2 and β3
(Phe51). This extensive and intricate network of H-bonding and hydrophobic
interactions that propagates into a significant portion of the structure
stabilizes the structure of the Y75 loop in the apoprotein, but replacing
Tyr75 or His83 with Ala results in conformational disorder in the
Y75 loop in apo-HasAp.

residues shown as sticks.

The Kinetics of Hemin Binding in the Two Variants Are Only Marginally
Affected Relative to Those of the wt, but the Two Variants Form Distinct
Millisecond High-Spin Intermediates
The relatively severe
changes introduced into the Y75 loop and the concomitant conformational
disorder introduced into neighboring structural domains in Y75A and
H83A apo-HasAp are likely to result in the initial distribution of
[apo-HasAp·hemin] substates during the process of hemin loading.
However, rapid interconversion between these [apo-HasAp·hemin]
substates is likely to take place, and the conformational disorder
observed in Y75A and H83A apo-HasAp does not dramatically impact the
rates of hemin loading in the variants compared to that in the wt
protein (Table ). Both variants show Kd values for the initial [apo-HasAp·hemin]
complex in the same micromolar range as that of the wt protein, and
the first coordination event defined by kcoord1 occurs in similar time frames for all three proteins. The variants
show kcoord2 values slightly higher than
that of the wt, but here again the differences are small.

In
contrast, the RFQ-RR analyses of the two variant proteins clearly
reveal that they form distinct millisecond intermediates. In Y75A,
the intermediate shows an intensity ratio between ν4 and ν3 porphyrin skeletal modes consistent with
coordination of His83 to the heme iron before closure of the H32 loop,
coordination of H32, and displacement of the H83 ligand by a water
molecule; coordination of His32 and rearrangement at the Fe–His83
site are not kinetically resolved and are possibly coupled events.
In comparison, the RFQ-RR spectrum of the intermediate in H83A supports
iron coordination by an O atom, either from solvent or from Tyr75,
before coordination of the second axial ligand, His32. Importantly,
despite these differences in coordination geometry in the [HasAp-hemin]
millisecond intermediates of the variant and wt proteins, all three
proteins follow equivalent kinetic profiles.

We have previously
proposed that π–π stacking
interactions between residues in the Y75 loop and hemin contribute
significantly to a “sticky” hydrophobic platform that
facilitates hemin capture., Within this framework,
the Tyr75 Oη···His83 Nδ hydrogen bond contributes to the hemin loading process by positioning
the Oη of Tyr to coordinate the heme iron (Figure ). In absence of a Tyr75 Oη···His83
Nδ hydrogen bond in the apo Y75A mutant, the conformational
disorder of residues in the Y75 loop may permit coordination of the
incoming hemin by H83. Subsequent scission of the His83–Fe
coordination bond and movement of the His83 side chain away from the
iron and toward its position in the structure of wt holo-HasAp are
likely a consequence of loop reorganization driven by the establishment
of productive π–π stacking and hydrophobic interactions
between hemin and side chains in the Y75 loop. Isothermal titration
calorimetry measurements with HasAsm revealed ≈250-
and ≈400-fold decreases in heme affinity in the H83A and Y75A
variants, respectively, relative to that of the wt protein. Our pre-steady state measurements show that
these mutations have little impact on the rates of formation of holoproteins
and therefore suggest that changes in binding affinity primarily reflect
increases in dissociation rates. Consequently, the data suggest that
axial ligation plays a prominent role in slowing the loss of hemin
from the hemophore, but the on rate of loading of hemin onto the apo
hemophore is governed by noncovalent hydrophobic interactions. In
this context, the changes in Kd and kcoord1 observed with the Y75A and H83A variants
relative to those of wt HasAp likely reflect changes in hydrophobic
and π–π stacking interactions between the porphyrin
macrocycle and the Y75 loop. Hence, the data at hand suggest that
HasA hemophores utilize hydrophobic interactions to capture hemin
while controlling its release via the heme iron axial coordination.
Future studies aimed at dissecting the thermodynamics and kinetics
of hemin capture and release with complementary variants, such as
Y75F and H83F, Y75F/H83F, and Y75A/H83A, will contribute to the establishment
of this mechanistic model.
