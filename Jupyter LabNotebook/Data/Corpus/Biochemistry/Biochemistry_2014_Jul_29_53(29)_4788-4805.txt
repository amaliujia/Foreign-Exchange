The hotdog-fold superfamily
is a functionally diverse family of evolutionarily related enzymes,
which share a common α + β-fold. The founding member of
this superfamily is the Escherichia coli β-hydroxydecanoyl-holo acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydrase/isomerase. Smith and co-workers
coined the name “hotdog-fold” to represent the observed
tertiary structure consisting of a 5-turn α-helix cradled by
a curved, 7-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The functional unit
was reported as a dimer, with the subunit interface joining the two
sheets into a continuous 14-stranded β-sheet. The two active
sites are located at opposite ends of the interfaced sheets.

Soon after the report of the dehydratase/isomerase, the hotdog-fold
was observed in the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 (Ps 4-HB-CoA
TE) and shortly thereafter in the 4-HB-CoA
thioesterase from Arthrobacter special strain AU
(Ar 4-HB-CoA TE) (Figure A and B). Both thioesterases catalyze the final
step of the 4-chlorobenzoate-degradation pathway., Surprisingly,
the two thioesterases share little sequence identity (&lt;25%), and
although the tertiary structures are alike, the arrangements of the
dimers, which form the respective (biological unit) tetramers, differ.
Specifically, the dimers of the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE associate
β-sheet-to-β-sheet, with the active sites directed to
solvent, whereas in the Ps 4-HB-CoA TE structure
the dimers are rotated 180° such that the active sites are directed
to the dimer–dimer interface.−

(dimer of dimers) of the hotdog-fold superfamily
clade AA member 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 represented in Pymol. The two structural representations are related by a 90° vertical
rotation. The red and pink subunits comprise one dimer, and the light
blue and royal blue subunits comprise the other dimer. The inert substrate
analog, 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA (shown in stick with green carbon atoms,
red oxygen atoms, blue nitrogen atoms, and a yellow sulfur atom),
is bound to each of the four active sites. (B) Pymol stereo representation
of the superposition of the tetrameric structures (dimer of dimers)
of the hotdog-fold superfamily clade AB member 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
thioesterase (subunits are colored dark teal) from Arthrobacter sp. strain AU (3) and YdiI from E. coli (subunits
are colored gray). The bound ligands, 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA (black)
and phenacyl-CoA (cyan), respectively are shown in stick. (C) Pymol
stereo representation of the superposition of the tetrameric structures
(dimer of dimers) of E. coli YbdB (cyan) and YdiI

of dimer) of E. coli YdiI bound with phenacyl-CoA
at the active site formed by subunits A, B, and C (shown in stick

yellow sulfur atoms).

Most relevant to the catalytic mechanism is the fact that
even
though the secondary structural elements that form the active sites
of the two thioesterases are highly conserved, the constellation of
catalytic residues is dissimilar as is the spatial location of the
essential catalytic carboxylate residue., Based on the
noted structural differences, the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE
and Ps 4-HB-CoA TE are viewed as prototypes of two
evolutionarily distinct clades of thioesterases within the hotdog-fold
superfamily. Notably, the common fold that
links these two structural clades dictates that, for all members,
substrate recognition is directed at holoACP or CoA-based
thioester metabolites.

The thioesterases constitute a large
subfamily within the hotdog-fold
superfamily. The biological function of the thioesterase is defined
by the identity of its in vivo substrate(s) (i.e.,
physiological substrate(s)) in combination with the biochemical context,
as determined by protein partners and/or elements of regulation. When
subjected to an in vitro activity screen, the typical
hotdog-fold thioesterase displays hydrolytic activities toward a range
of thioesters that extend well beyond the physiological substrate(s).− Whereas this lack of substrate specificity might, in earlier times,
have been interpreted as evidence for an “under-evolved”
enzyme (befitting the role of “scavenger”), it is now
well recognized that substrate promiscuity is a key trait of highly
evolvable enzymes (for review, see ref ()). We posit that this trait is inherent in the
simplicity and plasticity of the architecture of the hotdog-fold.

Presently, we have carried out a case study of two paralogs, namely,
YdiI and YbdB from E. coli. These thioesterases are
related by 59% sequence identity and are distinguished by very diverse
biological functions as detailed in the preceding companion paper and depicted in Scheme . Briefly, in E. coli, YdiI participates in menaquinone
biosynthesis as a catalyst for the hydrolysis of the pathway intermediate,
1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA.− YbdB, on the other hand, assists
in the biosynthesis of the siderophore enterobactin through catalyzed
hydrolysis of aberrant aroyl-holoEntB thioesters
that, as dead-end pathway intermediates, act to block enterobactin
formation.−

Biological Functions of E. coli YdiI
and YbdB
Herein, the structural
determinants for substrate recognition and
catalysis in these two paralogs are reported, and analyzed, within
the context of evolution of hotdog-fold thioesterase function. In
addition, because YdiI and YbdB are members of the same family clade
as Ar 4-HB-CoA TE (Figure B and C), a comparison of the relevant
elements of structure and mechanism with those of this evolutionarily
more distant relative is made, to identify those elements, which have
been retained despite extensive sequence divergence. The findings
are interpreted to suggest that a phosphopantethiene binding site
is conserved for targeting CoA and holoACP-based
thioester metabolites, and that the location of the ACP or adenosine
3′,5′-diphosphate binding site on the surface of the
thioesterase serves to promote promiscuity toward these two classes
of thioesters. Furthermore, we infer that the divergence in the alkyl/aryl
binding site sequence is important for the evolution of new biological
function. Finally, we propose that the roles played by the conserved
catalytic residues in thioester hydrolysis change in the process of
adaptation of the thioesterase to its new physiological substrate.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
The substrate benzoyl-CoA was purchased from
Aldrich/Sigma and the substrate 4-hydroxybenzyol-coenzyme A (4-HB-CoA)
was synthesized as previously reported. The inert substrate analog undecan-2-one-coenzyme A (UDO-CoA) was
synthesized as reported in ref (), and the inert substrate analogs 2,4-dihydroxyphenacyl-coenzyme
A (2,4-DHP-CoA) and phenacyl-coenzyme A (P-CoA) were synthesized by
reaction of CoA with 2-bromo-2′,4′-dihydroxyacetophenone
or 2-bromo-acetophenone, respectively (see the  for details). The enzymatic synthesis
of [14C]-benzoyl-CoA from [14C]-benzoate, CoA,
and ATP is detailed in the . Recombinant E. coli YbdB and YdiI, having C-terminal
His6-tags, were prepared as described in the companion
paper. Recombinant E. coli YbdB and YdiI, without the His6-tags (i.e., native),
were prepared as detailed in the .

Preparation of YbdB and YdiI Site-Directed Mutants
Site
directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange PCR
strategy (Stratagene) with the ydiI-His6/pET-23a or ybdB-His6/pET-23a plasmid
as template and commercial primers and Pfu Turbo as the polymerase.
The sequence of the mutated gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
The recombinant plasmids were used to transform competent E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells. The mutant proteins were
purified to &gt;90% homogeneity (as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis),
using the protocol described for the wild-type YdiI-His6 and YbdB-His6, in a yield
of 10–40 mg protein/g wet cell paste.

Determination of Steady-State
Kinetic Constants
Thioesterase
activity was measured using a 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) coupled assay. Reactions were monitored at 412 nm (Δε
= 13.6 mM–1·cm–1) using a
Beckman 640U spectrometer. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C
in 0.5 mL solutions containing 50 mM K+HEPES (pH 7.5),
1 mM DNTB, a known concentration of thioesterase, and varying concentrations
of thioester (0.5Km to 5Km). The catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA in 50 mM K+HEPES (pH 7.5) was directly monitored at 300 nm (Δε
= 11.8 mM–1·cm–1).

The initial velocity data, measured as a function of substrate concentration,
were analyzed using the software program Enzyme Kinetics v1.4 and
eq :where v is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximum velocity, [S] is the substrate
concentration, and Km is the Michaelis
constant. The kcat was calculated from Vmax/[E], where [E] is the total enzyme concentration
as determined by using the Bradford method.

Inhibition constants (Ki) were
determined
by measuring the initial velocity at varying substrate concentration
(0.5Km to 5Km) and fixed, changing inhibitor concentration (0, Ki, and 2Ki). The data were
fitted to eq  (to define the slope inhibition
constant Kis for competitive inhibition)
or to eq  (to define the respective intercept
and slope inhibition constants Kii and Kis for noncompetitive inhibition), respectively.where [I] is the inhibitor concentration, Kis is the slope inhibition constant, and Kii is the intercept inhibition constant.

YdiI 18O-Solvent-Labeling Experiments
A
typical 18O-labeling experiment was carried out as follows.
A 4.0 mL solution containing 89 μM YdiI in 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane
(Tris) and 50 mM NaCl (at pH 8.4) was lyophilized. To the resulting
powder, 370 μL of 99.2% enriched H218O
was added. After 15 min incubation on ice, the enzyme was assayed
to confirm the retention of catalytic activity. To this solution,
30 μL of lyophilized (30 μL of 10 mM stock concentration
in normal isotopic water) benzoyl-CoA suspended in 99.2% H218O water was added to yield final enzyme and substrate
concentrations of 889 and 750 μM, respectively. The reaction
mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then filtered
using a 10 kDa microseparation filter (Millipore). The filtrate was
acidified with 10 μL of 6 M HCl and extracted four times with
1 mL aliquots of ethyl acetate. The pooled extracts were dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was evaporated in
vacuo. For the (multiple-turnover) control experiment, a
20 μL aliquot of the 89 μM YdiI stock solution was used.
Following lyophilization, the resulting powder was suspended in 370
μL of 99.2% H218O, and to this solution
30 μL of 10 mM benzoyl-CoA in 99.2% H218O was added. The final concentrations of YdiI and benzoyl-CoA were
45 and 750 μM, respectively. The GC/MS analyses were conducted
using an Agilent 5975C Series GC/MS apparatus with a Triple-Axis detector.
The temperature program used is as follows: 250 °C inlet, 80
°C initial temperature held for 1 min and ramped to 180 °C
at a rate of 7 °C/min, then ramped to 250 °C at a rate of
20 °C/min and held for 6 min. The mass analyzer was set to detect
in the range of 50–450 m/z. The benzoic acid eluted in the time frame of 7.5–8.0 min.

Rapid-Quench Studies of the YdiI-Catalyzed Hydrolysis of [14C]benzoyl-CoA under Single and Multiple Turnover Conditions
Experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a rapid-quench
instrument from KinTek Instruments. For the multiple-turnover reaction
of YdiI-catalyzed hydrolysis of [14C]-benzoyl-CoA, the
final enzyme and substrate concentrations used were 10 and 50 μM,
respectively, whereas for the single-turnover reaction, respective
concentrations of 50 and 5 μM were employed. The reactions were
initiated by mixing the enzyme with the [14C]-benzoyl-CoA
in 10 mM K+HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 M NaCl
and then quenched after a specific time with 0.2 M HCl. The protein
was separated from the quenched reaction mixture using a 10 000
MWCO centrifuge column (Millipore). The [14C]-benzoyl-CoA
and [14C]-benzoic acid were separated on an analytical
C18 column (RESTEK) by HPLC using the same procedures as described
above, and then quantified using an in-line β-RAM4 (Lab Logic)
scintillation counter. Peak integrations were performed by using Laura
software (Lab Logic), and the relative ratios were used to calculate
the substrate and product concentrations. The time course data were
fitted by iterative simulation using the KinTek Corp. Global Kinetic
Explorer software program.

YdiI Stopped-Flow Kinetic Experiments
A DX.17MV sequential
stopped-flow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, U.K.)
with a dead time of 3 ms was used for measurement of transient rate
constants of YdiI-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA. All reactions
were carried out in triplicate using 50 mM K+HEPES buffer
(pH 7.5) at 25 °C as the solvent. The substrate concentration
was monitored at 300 nm (Δε = 11.8 mM–1·cm–1). A single-turnover reaction mixture
initially consisted of 60 μL of 124 μM YdiI mixed with
60 μL of 100 μM 4-HB-CoA to give a final concentration
of 62 μM YdiI and 50 μM 4-HB-CoA. The time course data
were fitted to the single exponential eq .
The multiple-turnover reactions contained 60 μL of 200 μM
4-HB-CoA mixed with 60 μL of 20, 32, and 40 μM YdiI. The
final concentration of 4-HB-CoA was 100 μM, and the final concentrations
of YdiI were 10, 16, and 20 μM.Y0 and Yt are the reaction
solution
absorbance at time t = 0 and t,
respectively. A is the amplitude of the total absorbance
change, and k is the apparent rate constant.

YbdB and
YdiI Crystallization and X-ray Crystallographic Data
Collection
Purified wild-type YbdB was concentrated to 10–15
mg/mL in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), plus 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and purified wild-type YdiI was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in
20 mM Tris buffer pH 8.3, plus 50 mM NaCl. Initial crystallization
conditions were identified using the Index Screen (Hampton Research)
setup in Corning 96-well crystallography plates. Crystals of complexes
of YbdB and YdiI with their respective inhibitors were obtained via
cocrystallization of YbdB with 2,4-DHP-CoA or P-CoA or via cocrystallization
of YdiI with 2,4-DHP-CoA, P-CoA, or UDO-CoA using the hanging-drop
vapor diffusion method (0.5 mL well solution). In the case of YbdB,
1.0 μL of protein at 10–15 mg/mL was combined with well
solution containing 2 mM substrate analog and 2.0 M sodium malonate
(pH 7.0). In the case of YdiI, the drop volume, protein concentration,
and substrate analog concentration were the same as those used for
YbdB crystallization but the well solution contained 0.07–0.08
M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) and 0.18–0.20 M magnesium acetate.
Crystals of YbdB·(2,4-DHP-CoA) and YbdB·(P-CoA) grew at
17 °C as rectangular plates, to dimensions of ca. 0.2 ×
0.2 × 0.05 mm3 within 3 days. Crystals of YdiI·(2,4-DHP-CoA),
YdiI·(P-CoA), and YdiI·(UDO-CoA) grew at 17 °C to the
dimensions of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3 within 4 days.

YbdB·(2,4-DHP-CoA) crystals were transferred to paratone N
and flash-cooled in a stream of gaseous N2 at 100 K, whereas
YbdB·(P-CoA) crystals were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen
without additional cryoprotection. YdiI·(2,4-DHP-CoA), YdiI·(P-CoA),
and YdiI·(UDO-CoA) crystals were dehydrated by soaking for 5
min in paratone N before flash-cooling in a stream of gaseous N2 at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data for crystalline YbdB·(P-CoA)
were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven
National Laboratory, Beamline X12C and then processed using HKL2000. X-ray diffraction data for crystalline YbdB·(2,4-DHP-CoA)
were collected using Cu Kα radiation from a Rigaku RU-300 generator
equipped with an R-Axis IV++ image plate (Boston University School
of Medicine) and then processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK. All other data sets were collected on a Bruker
MICROSTAR microfocus rotating anode with Helios optics equipped with
a Platinum 135 CCD detector using a four-circle kappa goniometer (Boston
University) and then processed using Bruker Proteum 2 software. The
data collection and processing statistics are provided in Table .

Refinement
of the X-ray Structures of YbdB and YdiI Bound with
Substrate Analogs
Phases for all structures were determined
by molecular replacement using the known structures of apo-YbdB (PDB ID 1VH9; ref ()) and apo-YdiI (PDB ID 1SBK; Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium), as the
respective search models, in conjunction with the MOLREP software
of the CCP4 program package. The models
thus generated were refined with PHENIX using individual B-factor refinement (occupancies were not refined).
Waters were added using Coot’s water picking algorithm and
then were manually inspected to ensure good placement. The final models were validated using tools
implemented in PROCHECK. The dihedral
angles of all residues are within the allowed region of the Ramachandran
plot. Refinement statistics and model geometry for all five structures
are listed in Table . The final model of the
YbdB·(2,4-DHP-CoA) complex includes two YbdB subunits and two
2,4-DHP-CoA molecules minus the C-terminal Gly137 in both subunits,
and the Leu136 in subunit B. The final model of the YbdB·(P-CoA)
complex includes four YbdB subunits (two dimers) and four P-CoA molecules.
The final models of the YdiI complexes include four subunits and four
2,4-DHP-CoA or P-CoA ligands, plus eight subunits with 13 UDO-CoA
molecules (eight are bound to the active sites and five are located
at the protein surface). The refinement statistics are summarized
in Table .

Results and Discussion
Structural
Determinants of YbdB and YdiI Substrate Specificity
and Catalysis
For the purpose of examining the structural
determinants for substrate binding, 2,4-dihydroxyphenacyl-CoA (2,4-DHP-CoA),
phenacyl-CoA (P-CoA), and undecan-2-one-CoA (UDO-CoA) (see Chart  for chemical structures) were synthesized to serve
as stable keto-thioether (O=C–CH2—S)
analogs of the corresponding in vitro thioester substrates
2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA, and decanoyl-CoA, respectively. The Kis values,
determined for the analogs as competitive inhibitors of YbdB and YdiI-catalyzed
benzoyl-CoA hydrolysis are reported in Table  (the Lineweaver–Burk plots are shown in Figure SI1 in the ). The structures of YbdB
in complex with 2,4-DHP or P-CoA were determined, as were structures of the respective YdiI complexes derived from
all three substrate analogs (the statistics are reported in Table ; the electron density maps of the bound ligands
are shown Figure SI2 in the ).

The substrate used was 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA,
and the reaction was monitored at 300 nM.

Noncompetitive inhibition was observed: Kis = 210 ± 10 μM and Kii = 1130 ± 100 μM.

Structures of Selected Substrates, Substrate Analogs, and Products:
1,4-Dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA (1), 2-Hydroxybenzoyl-holoEntB (2), Benzoyl-CoA (3), Coenzyme A (4), 2,4-Dihydroxyphenacyl-CoA
(5), and Undecan-2-one-CoA (6)
The YbdB (137 amino acids) and YdiI (136 amino acids) quaternary
structures are best described as a dimer of dimers (see superimposed
structures in Figure C and the YdiI structure,
with subunits labeled, in Figure D). The monomer
possesses a five-turn α-helix, which is wrapped by a sheet formed
by five antiparallel β-strands. Monomers associate in the usual
manner, β-sheet-edge-to-β-sheet-edge, to form an elongated
sheet, which stacks back-to-back with the sheet of the opposing dimer;
the four respective central α-helices are thus located at the
solvent interface. Both the tertiary and quaternary structures of
YbdB and YdiI thioesterases are closely matched, and they are quite
similar to those of the prototype of the type AB clade, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain AU (Ar 4-HB-CoA TE) (Figure B).

The four YdiI or YbdB active sites are
located at the interfaces
of the subunits that comprise the respective dimer units. A loop from
one of the two subunits of the opposing dimer appears to contribute
to ligand binding through interaction with the ligand pyrophosphate
moiety. Henceforth, the subunits which form paired active sites are
referred to as subunits “A” and “B”, and
the subunit that contributes the pyrophosphate-binding loop as subunit
“C” (for illustration, see YdiI in Figure D). In the text and figures that follow, the residues located
on designated subunit C are labeled with a double asterisk (**), those
located on subunit B with a single asterisk (*), and those located
on subunit A are not labeled with an asterisk.

The structures
of the respective YbdB·(2,4-DHP-CoA) and YbdB·(P-CoA)
complexes superimpose with the structure of the apo-YbdB structure (PDB 1VH9) with Cα RMSD values of 0.37 and 0.43 Å,
respectively. Likewise, the structures of the YdiI·(2,4-DHP-CoA)
and YdiI·(P-CoA) complexes superimpose with the structure of apo-YdiI (PDB entry 1SBK) with Cα RMSD values of 0.58 and
0.56 Å, respectively. Only in the case of the structure of the
YdiI·(UDO-CoA) complex are significant ligand-induced conformational
changes observed (RMSD 1.14–1.18 Å). Three secondary structural
elements (α-helix residues Leu9-Gly16 and loop residues Gln48-Leu53
and Thr74-Lys79; Figure SI3 in the ), located at the acyl-binding site region of the
active site, shift to expand the binding pocket occupied by the long
UDO-CoA aliphatic chain (Figure A). In contrast,
the binding pockets observed in the YdiI·(P-CoA) (Figure B) and YbdB·(P-CoA) (Figure C) are unchanged.

the bound ligands of the (A) YdiI·(undecan-2-one-CoA), (B) YdiI·(phenacyl-CoA),
and (C) YbdB·(phenacyl-CoA) complexes. The ligands are shown
in stick with green carbon atoms, red oxygen atoms, blue nitrogen
atoms, orange phosphorus atoms, and a yellow sulfur atom.

Overall, the three-dimensional structures of YbdB
and YdiI are
highly similar despite the noted divergence in sequence. The pairwise
sequence alignment and the locations of substituted residues on the
three-dimensional structure are provided in the  (Figure SI4). Here, we examine the
differences in YbdB and YdiI active site residues and their interaction
with the different substrate analogs. For convenience, the findings
are presented by section starting with the binding interactions involving
the substrate CoA nucleotide, followed by the phosphopantetheine arm,
the thioester substituent, and, last, the aryl or alkyl unit.

Structure
analysis and Mutagenesis of the CoA Nucleotide-Binding
Site
The substrate specificity profile analysis reported
in the companion paper showed that YdiI
and YbdB are highly active catalysts toward the hydrolysis of thioesters
containing CoA as the thiol group. For instance, the substrate specificity
constants (kcat/Km) measured for the YdiI- and YbdB-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions
of benzoyl-CoA are 7 × 105 and 2 × 105 M–1·s–1, respectively (Table ). The X-ray structures of the YbdB and YdiI complexes
indicate that the CoA nucleotide-binding site is formed at the interface
of subunits A–C (Figure A). The nucleotide
moiety resides at the protein surface where it interacts with surface
residues via the 3′-phosphate (hydrogen bond formation with
the Arg91 side chain) and 5′-pyrophosphate (hydrogen bond formation
with the backbone amide NHs of the hairpin turn residues 109**, and
110**, and 111**) (Figure B). The high B-factors
(Figure SI5, ) observed
for the atoms of the nucleotide compared to the surrounding protein
side-chains in the crystalline complex indicate motion or disorder
and thus, the absence of tight binding (note that the occupancies
were not refined). The polar side chains of the β-turn-β
motif of subunit C could conceivably interact with the nucleotide
if they were to assume alternate, yet accessible, rotomer conformations.
However, aside from His106**, these residues differ between YbdB and
YdiI (Figure B; sequence alignment shown in
Figure SI4A in the ), and furthermore, they are not stringently conserved among the
respective sets of YbdB and YdiI orthologs. The differences in the residues that frame the nucleotide binding
sites in YdiI and YbdB culminate in the formation of two very distinct
surface topologies having unique steric and electrostatic features
(Figure C).

Ala mutants were constructed to independently query if the
side
chains of the stringently conserved residues Arg91 and His106** contribute
to substrate binding. At the same time, the Ala mutant was made to
test the contribution by side chain of Ser109**, which in the YdiI
structure is located within hydrogen bond distance of the 5′-α-phosphate
group (Figure B). The steady-state kinetic
constants kcat and kcat/Km were determined for hydrolysis
of the benzoyl-CoA substrate, catalyzed by the purified mutant enzymes
(Table ). The kcat and kcat/Km values measured for S109A** and H106A** YdiI are not significantly
different from those measured for wild-type YdiI. On the other hand,
the kcat and kcat/Km values measured for the R91*A YdiI
is reduced ∼10-fold, indicating that Arg91* facilitates productive
(i.e., oriented for catalysis) substrate binding. We note here, and
will revisit in later discussion, that Arg91* corresponds to Arg102*
in clade AB prototype Ar 4-HB-CoA TE, wherein Arg102*
has been shown to contribute to substrate binding.,

Structure of the Pantetheine-Binding Site
The pantetheine
arm assumes an extended conformation as it threads through the tunnel-like
channel formed by residues His89, His90 (Val90 YdiI), Arg91, Pro92
(Ser92 YdiI), Gly55, and Leu52 located on one subunit and by the residues
Gly82* and Val81* located on the opposing subunit (Figure A). The backbone amide C=Os of His(Val)90
and Gly82* are positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the respective
NH functions of the pantetheine moiety. The side chains of Pro(Ser)92,
Leu52, and Val81* enclose the binding site, excluding solvent. The
B-factors of the atoms that comprise the pantetheine arm are similar
to those of the surrounding side chains (∼7–12 Å2) indicating that these are the most highly immobilized atoms
of the ligand in its bound state (Figure SI5, ).

YbdB·(P-CoA) and YdiI·(P-CoA)

distances (Å) between potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors
are shown for YdiI (dark gray) and YbdB (teal). The side chains are
shown in stick and labeled to identify the conserved residue, or with
the YbdB residue followed by YdiI residue in brackets. (A) Pantetheine
moiety binding site is shown. (B) Catalytic site is shown. The red
and magenta colored dashed-lines connect the phenacyl carbonyl carbon
atom with the one of the two Glu63* carboxylate group oxygen atoms.

The hydrogen bond formation, combined
with the desolvation of the
hydrophobic sites, and the van der Waals attractive forces acting
on the closely packed atoms are expected to generate substantial binding
energy. Indeed, the binding energy derived from the pantetheine arm,
combined with the small contribution made by the weak protein surface
interactions with the nucleotide, leads to tight CoA binding (Table ) and, hence, to tight substrate binding. In addition,
the steric and electrostatic properties of the binding site are likely
to play a key role in the placement of the thioester moiety in register
with the catalytic residues, as required for productive substrate
binding, a determinant of turnover rate (kcat).

Structure Analysis and Mutagenesis of the Catalytic Site
The substrate thioester group and the YdiI/YbdB active site residues
that surround it comprise the reaction center. The structures of YdiI
and YbdB bound with P-CoA represented in Figure B show that the residues at this site are conserved, and that the
positions of the respective P-CoA ligands are the same (Figure B). However, to the extent that the steric properties
of the inhibitor methlyene ketone moiety (O=C—CH2SCoA) differ from those of the substrate thioester moiety
(O=C—SCoA), the observed alignment of the catalytic
residues is an approximation. Nevertheless, we find that the P-CoA
ring carbonyl group is positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from the
α-helix Gly55 backbone amide NH moiety, and to interact with
the positive pole of the helix macro dipole. Substrate activation
via polarization of the thioester C=O by the α-helix
N-terminus is common to the catalytic mechanisms employed by hotdog-fold
thioesterases.,,− It is therefore a component of the posited catalytic mechanism(s)
depicted in Scheme .

Two Chemical Pathways
for YdiI- and YbdB-Catalyzed Hydrolysis of
Benzoyl-CoA and the Roles That the Amino Acid Residues at the Respective
Catalytic Sites Might Play in Catalysis
The oxygen atom transfer from
water to Glu63* (black filled circle) or benzoic acid (gray filled
circle) is illustrated.

The YbdB and YdiI
reaction centers also include His54, Gln58, and
Ser67*. The imidazole ring N(1) of His54 is located in close proximity
to the P-CoA O=C—CH2 oxygen atom; however,
the orientation of the imidazole ring observed in the structure is
not consistent with hydrogen bond formation with the ligand C=O
(Figure B). We speculate that the stringent
conservation of His54 is the result of the space-filling property
of its imidazole ring, which might contribute to the alignment of
neighboring residues. Notably, the replacement of the His54 residue
with Ala resulted in a 126-fold reduction in kcat and a 514-fold reduction in kcat/Km as measured for H54A YdiI-catalyzed
benzoyl-CoA hydrolysis (Table ). The H54A
YbdB mutant proved to be inactive. Thus, His54 appears to be an important
residue for catalysis.

The methylene carbon atom (highlighted
green in Figure B) of the P-CoA O=C—CH2 moiety corresponds to the substrate thioester sulfur atom.
In the
YbdB structure, the methylene carbon atom is within close proximity
of the Gln48 side chain NH2 and the Ser67* side chain OH,
which indicates possible substrate activation via hydrogen formation
with one or both hydrogen bond donors. On the other hand, in the YdiI
structure, the methylene carbon atom of the P-CoA O=C—CH2 moiety is more distant from the Gln48 NH2, but
it is still in close proximity of the Ser67* hydroxyl group. To assess
whether Gln48 and Ser67* are required for efficient catalysis, the
respective Ala mutants were prepared for steady-state kinetic analysis.
Compared to the kinetic constants measured for benzoyl-CoA hydrolysis
catalyzed by wild-type YdiI, the Q48A YdiI mutant kcat value was reduced 354-fold and the kcat/Km value was reduced 1800-fold
(Table ). The Q48A YbdB mutant was found to
be inactive. Therefore, we conclude that Gln48 plays an important
role in YdiI and YbdB catalysis, and thus, in Scheme  we depict hydrogen bond formation between Gln48 and the CoA
thiolate-anion leaving group. On the other hand, Ala replacement of
YdiI Ser67* reduced the kcat value only
7-fold and the kcat/Km value only 4-fold (Table ) (YbdB
was not tested). This finding indicates that Ser67* does not make
a major contribution to catalytic efficiency.

The side chains
of stringently conserved His89* and Glu63* are
aligned for formation of a hydrogen bond between the N(3)H (of the corresponding imidazole
tautomer) and one of the two Glu63* carboxylate oxygen atoms (Figure B, Scheme ). This interaction
orients the Glu63* carboxylate group and thus, it is expected to assist
Glu63* as the active site nucleophile, or base catalyst. Ala replacement
of the YdiI His89* residue results in a 22-fold reduction in kcat and a 288-fold reduction in kcat/Km as measured for catalyzed
benzoyl-CoA hydrolysis (Table ). Catalytic
activity could not be detected for the E63*A and E63*Q YdiI mutants,
nor was it observed for the E63*A YbdB mutant. The E63*D YdiI mutant
was found to retain some activity; however, the kcat is reduced 443-fold and the kcat/Km is reduced 2118-fold relative
to the corresponding wild-type YdiI kinetic constants (Table ). We conclude that the carboxylate group of the
Glu63* residue and the length of the Glu63* side chain are critical
determinants of catalysis. The His89* contributes to the catalytic
efficiency through the assisted alignment of Glu63*.

The close
proximity of the Glu63* carboxylate group to the P-CoA
O=C—CH2 carbonyl carbon (Figure B), observed in the YdiI and YbdB complexes is consistent
with the role of Glu63* as the catalytic base or nucleophile (Scheme ). Unfortunately, the orientation of the Glu63*
carboxylate group observed in the respective structures does not allow
the distinction to be made between Glu63* function in nucleophilic
catalysis and Glu63* function in base catalysis. First, the O=C—CH2 moiety is not properly aligned with the Glu63* carboxylate
group for nucleophilic attack, and second,
there is insufficient space between the carbonyl carbon and the Glu63*
carboxylate group for a water molecule to bind (see Figure SI6 in
the ). Owing to this
ambiguity, we were impelled to carry out further investigation, namely,
the 18O-solvent isotope labeling and transient kinetic
studies reported below.

Structure of the Aryl/Alkyl Group-Binding
Site
The
alky/aryl group-binding sites of YdiI and YbdB are located at the
subunit–subunit interfaces formed within the respective dimer
units (Figure A). The structures of YbdB and
YdiI bound with P-CoA reveal a solvent inaccessible aryl group-binding
site in the case of YbdB (Figure C), and a
partially open aryl group-binding site in the case of YdiI (Figure B). The substrate aryl/alkyl group-binding regions
in YdiI and YbdB are largely conserved (Figure B). The common residues include Val80, Val81, His54, Pro49, Phe50,
Gln48, and Glu63* plus Ser67*, whereas binding site residues Phe71*,
Met68*, and Thr15* of the YbdB correspond to the YdiI residues Tyr71*,
Val68*, and Met15*. The aromatic rings of the conserved Phe50 residues
and of the YdiI Tyr71* and YbdB Phe71* residues contribute to solvent
exclusion (Figure A and B and Figure SI3 in
the ).

and YdiI·(phenacyl-CoA) complexes (enzyme carbon atoms are colored
cyan and gray, respectively; ligand carbons atoms colored green and
black, respectively) to show the residues that contribute to the phenacyl
binding pocket in the context of the residues that form the catalytic
site. Panel (A) shows the locations of the residues on the main chain
of subunit A and of subunit B, whereas panel (B) highlights the residues.

and YdiI·(2,4-dihydroxyphenacyl-CoA) complexes (enzyme

hydrogen bonds with the ring hydroxyl groups (dashed lines colored
teal or black for the short bond distances and gray and cyan for the
long bond distances; lengths are shown in angstroms).

The comparatively high catalytic efficiencies that
YbdB and YdiI
display with benzoyl-CoA serving as substrate, suggests that the benzoyl
groups of the respective physiological substrates (hydroxy)benzoyl-holoEntB and 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA serve as the key
substrate recognition motif. Indeed, the findings from the substrate
specificity analysis demonstrated that ring hydroxylation does not
significantly alter the value of kcat/Km. To gain insight
into the mode of interaction between the binding pocket and the hydroxylated
benzoyl ring, the X-ray crystal structures of YbdB and YdiI in complex
with 2,4-DHP-CoA were determined. As shown in Figure C, the O=C—CH2S groups of the 2,4-DHP-CoA
ligands are similarly oriented through hydrogen bond formation with
the Gly55 backbone amide NH. On the other hand, the 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl
rings are “flipped” 180° relative to one another.
The ring orientation observed in YbdB allows hydrogen bond formation
between the ring C(2)OH and the His54, whereas the ring orientation
observed in YdiI allows hydrogen bond formation between the ring C(2)OH
and the Asn48.

Kinetics and Mechanisms of YdiI Catalysis
Glu63*
Function in Catalysis
The X-ray crystallographic
structures of YdiI and YbdB bound with inhibitors, and the kinetic
properties of the respective Glu63* site-directed mutant enzymes,
support Glu63* as the key catalytic residue. However, as noted previously,
the structural data do not allow a clear distinction to be made between
the role of Glu63* in catalysis as the nucleophile or the general
base (Scheme ). With the objective of making
this distinction, we carried out transient kinetic and solvent 18O-labeling experiments. Precedent for the experimental approach
employed here derives from earlier work performed on the type AB and
type AA clade prototypes,Ar and Ps 4-HB-CoA TE. For both thioesterases, catalysis
proceeds via the nucleophilic catalysis pathway with rate-limiting
hydrolysis of the mixed anhydride intermediate formed with the Asp17
of Ps 4-HB-CoA TE or with the Glu73* of Ar 4-HB-CoA TE.,

To provide context for
the experimental results reported below, we first point out that the
time courses measured for the Ps and Ar 4-HB-CoA thioesterases defined a rapid “burst” of
substrate consumption associated with the first catalytic turnover
of 4-HB-CoA followed by a slower steady-state rate followed in subsequent
turnovers. These results, combined with the observation of normal
solvent kinetic isotope effects on the respective kcat values, were interpreted as evidence for the formation
of the mixed anhydride intermediate in the catalytic pathways of these
thioesterases. Second, we note that the solvent 18O-labeling
experiments that were carried out to determine the regiochemistry
of hydrolytic cleavage of the mixed anhydride intermediate formed
from 4-HB-CoA showed that with the Ps 4-HB-CoA TE
intermediate hydrolysis occurred solely at the 4-hydroxybenzoyl carbonyl
carbon, whereas with the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE intermediate hydrolysis occurred with 90% H218O attack at the 4-hydroxybenzoyl carbonyl carbon and
10% at the Glu73* carbonyl carbon. Finally,
we showed (1) that the burst phase kinetics and the 10% transfer of 16O from enzyme to the 4-hydroxybenzoate product are not displayed
by the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE E73D* mutant, consistent with
a switch from nucleophilic catalysis to base catalysis, and (2) that
the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE T77A* mutant displays burst phase
kinetics, a 10-fold reduction in the rate constant governing the hydrolysis
of the mixed anhydride intermediate, and the loss of regiospecifity
in H218O attack (consistent with the role of Thr77* in orienting the water nucleophile
for attack at the 4-hydroxybenzoyl carbonyl carbon).

The Presteady-State
Time Course for YdiI Catalysis
Because YdiI proved to be
the more robust of the two paralogs, it
was used as the experimental subject. Transient kinetic methods were
employed to monitor substrate consumption over the first few catalytic
turnovers to detect nucleophilic catalysis by observing a “burst
phase” (for formation of the reaction intermediate) associated
with the first turnover. Accordingly, stopped-flow absorbance techniques
were used to measure the time course for the initial turnovers of
4-HB-CoA, catalyzed by YdiI, at pH 7.5. The 4-HB-CoA was employed
as substrate because the para-hydroxybenzoyl-thioester
chromophore possesses a strong absorption band at 300 nm, which is
eliminated upon cleavage of the thioester substituent. Thus, the progress
of the reaction could be monitored directly, that is, without the
use of the DTNB coupling agent.

Note that if the rate of thioester
cleavage is fast relative to an ensuing step (e.g., the hydrolysis
of the mixed anhydride intermediate formed by Glu63*), the rate of
the first catalytic turnover will exceed the rate of subsequent turnovers.
In addition, if the internal equilibrium position favors the forward
direction, the amount of substrate consumed will roughly correspond
to the concentration of the YdiI employed in the reaction, which is
set at a level high enough for monitoring a single turnover. The predicted
“burst” of substrate consumption was, however, not observed
in the time courses measured for the hydrolysis of 100 μM 4-HB-CoA
in the presence of 10, 16, or 20 μM YdiI (see Figure A). Instead, the first catalytic turnover on YdiI
was found to take place at the same rate as the ensuing turnovers,
namely, 5.8 s–1, which is comparable to the steady-state
rate constant kcat = 5.2 s–1.

100 μM 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
catalyzed by 10 μM (green), 16 μM (red), and 20 μM
(black) YdiI in 50 mM K+HEPES (pH 7.5) at 25 °C. Reactions
were monitored at 300 nm using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. (B)

mixed 14C-labeled anhydride intermediate and/or [14C]-benzoate remaining in reaction solution upon the acid quench.
(C) Same as in (B) except that 4 μM YdiI and 50 μM [14C]-benzoyl-CoA were used.

For confirmation of this finding, a second method was used
to monitor
the catalytic turnovers. Specifically, [14C]-benzoyl-CoA
was used as substrate (the radiolabel facilitates precise quantitation
of the reaction solution components) in conjunction with rapid acid-quench
and HPLC chromatographic techniques. The acid-quench denatures the
protein, thereby releasing product and unconsumed substrate. If the
mixed anhydride is present, it is expected to undergo hydrolysis in
the quench solution, releasing [14C]-benzoic acid to the
product pool. The [14C]-benzoic acid and the unconsumed
[14C]-benzoyl-CoA were separated, and the level of radioactivity
in each fraction was measured. The time courses determined for the
reactions carried out using two different ratios of enzyme to substrate
(1:2.5 and 1:12.5) showed the same result, which is no “burst”
phase associated with the first turnover (Figure B and C, respectively).

Taken together, these results
indicate that the cleavage of the
substrate thioester moiety occurs in a chemical step that is slower
than the ensuing step(s), a finding that is consistent both with the
general base catalysis mechanism and with the nucleophilic catalysis
mechanism wherein the formation of the anhydride intermediate is rate-limiting.

Catalysis of a Single-Turnover Reaction in H218O Solvent
As illustrated in Scheme , the Glu63* base-catalyzed, single-turnover reaction of benzoyl-CoA
in H218O solvent is predicted to proceed with
incorporation of an 18O into the carboxylate group of the
benzoic acid product to form [18O, 16O]-benzoate.
If, on the other hand, the Glu63* reacts with the benzoyl-CoA to form
the mixed anhydride intermediate, and hydrolysis occurs at the Glu63*
carbonyl carbon, the solvent 18O atom will transfer to
the Glu63* and the bridging 16O atom of the anhydride will
transfer to the benzoate to form [16O2]-benzoate.
Conversely, attack of the H218O at the benzoyl
carbonyl carbon of the mixed anhydride intermediate will form [18O, 16O]-benzoate as the product rather than [16O2]-benzoate (Scheme ).
Formation of the [16O2]-benzoate is thus diagnostic
of the intermediacy of the mixed anhydride, whereas formation of [18O, 16O]-benzoate is consistent with general base
catalysis as well as nucleophilic catalysis that proceeds via attack
of the H218O at the benzoyl carbonyl carbon
of the mixed anhydride intermediate.

Accordingly, a single-turnover
reaction was carried out using a mixture of wild-type YdiI (889 μM)
and benzoyl-CoA (750 μM) in 99.2% H218O at pH 7.5. The benzoic acid was isolated from the acid-quenched
reaction mixture by solvent extraction and then subjected to mass
spectral analysis. The mass spectrum of the benzoic acid standard,
at natural isotopic abundance, is characterized by the parent ion
(M*) peak at 122.1 m/z, parent ion
fragment (M*–OH) peak at 105.1 m/z, and parent ion fragment (M*–COOH) at 77.1 m/z. The parent ion (M*) and parent ion fragment
(M*–OH) were used as reporters of 18O-incorporation
from the H218O solvent. The mass spectrum (not
shown) of the benzoic acid isolated from a control reaction, in which
the enzyme was absent, was the same as that of the standard, thereby
showing that the benzoic acid is not subject to isotopic exchange
under these conditions. The mass spectrum of the benzoic acid isolated
from the single-turnover reaction showed peaks 122.1 m/z ([16O2]-benzoic acid parent
ion) and 124.1 m/z ([18O, 16O]-benzoic acid parent ion) at a 1:5 ratio (20% 16O-incorporation) (Figure A). The
ratio of the parent ion fragment (M*–OH) peaks at 105.1 m/z and 107.1 m/z is 1.34:1.00. Similar results were obtained for experiments
carried out in triplicate. The 17% [16O2]-benzoic
acid observed for the single-turnover reaction is contrasted with
the 4% [16O2]-benzoic acid observed for the
multiple-turnover reaction of benzoyl-CoA (750 μM) catalyzed
by wild-type YdiI (45 μM), for which 6% is the predicted maximum
value. This result is analogous to that obtained previously for the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE, and it can be interpreted as evidence for
the formation of a mixed anhydride intermediate. However, because
we did not observe a burst phase associated with the first turnover
in the multiple-turnover reaction time course, we cannot distinguish
between nucleophilic catalysis coupled with preferred (not strict)
regiochemistry of hydrolysis of the anhydride intermediate at the
benzoyl carbonyl carbon versus competing mechanistic pathways in which
Glu63* base catalysis dominates over Glu63* nucleophilic catalysis
(see Scheme ).

GC/MS spectra of benzoic
acid samples isolated from the acid-quenched
reaction mixtures generated from the incubation of benzoyl-CoA with
wild-type or mutant YdiI in 99.2% H218O buffered
at pH 7.5 and 25 °C with 50 mM K+HEPES. Reaction solutions
initially contained (A) 889 μM wild-type YdiI and 750 μM
benzoyl-CoA; (B) 45 μM wild-type YdiI and 750 μM benzoyl-CoA;
(C) 933 S67A* YdiI and 750 μM benzoyl-CoA; (D) 810 μM
E63D* YdiI and 750 μM benzoyl-CoA.

For the purpose of extending the comparison between YdiI
and the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE, the single-turnover reaction
in solvent
H218O was carried out with the YdiI mutants
S67A* and E63D*. The mass spectral data shown in Figure C and D define ratios of [16O2]-benzoic
acid to [18O, 16O]-benzoic acid equal to 1:9
and 1:12 (10% and 7.7% 16O-incorporation into product),
respectively. The reduction in 16O-incorporation observed
with the YdiI E63D* mutant is consistent with that observed of the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE E73D* mutant. In contrast, whereas the 16O-incorporation observed with the YdiI S67A* mutant is decreased,
it was increased for the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE T77A* mutant,
thus indicating that the S67* and T77* contribute to catalysis differently.

Substrate Binding and Product Dissociation
The binding
affinities of YdiI and YbdB toward the substrate benzoyl-CoA are approximated
by the P-CoA competitive inhibition constants Kis = 7.8 ± 0.4 μM for YdiI and Kis = 65 ± 6 μM for YbdB (Table ). The X-ray crystallographic structures of the YdiI·(P-CoA)
and YbdB·(P-CoA) complexes show that the orientation of P-CoA
is such that only the CoA moiety has access to solvent. An analogous
scenario is indicated by the X-ray structure of the homolog Ar 4-HB-CoA TE in complex with 4-hydroxyphenacyl-CoA. Based on structural data alone, one would predict
ordered product release, with CoA departure occurring first. Indeed,
in earlier work, this prediction was verified for the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE by demonstrating noncompetitive (mixed-type) product
inhibition for CoA (Kis = 16 ± 2
μM, Kii = 29 ± 2 μM)
and competitive product inhibition for 4-hydroxybenzoate (Kis = 240 ± 80 μM). In the present work, CoA was also shown to be a noncompetitive
product inhibitor of YbdB-catalyzed benzoyl-CoA hydrolysis (Kis = 210 ± 10 μM, Kii = 1130 ± 100 μM) (Figure SI9A, ; Table ); however, for YdiI, competitive inhibition by CoA was observed
(Kis = 16 ± 1 μM) (Figure SI9B, ; Table ). Competitive inhibition is consistent with ordered product
release only if the dissociation of CoA follows that of benzoic acid.
The release of benzoic acid from the YdiI ternary product complex
could occur providing that the aryl/alkyl group-binding pocket opens
to solvent. Although the binding site is largely closed in the X-ray
crystal structure of the YdiI·(P-CoA) complex (Figure B), it is open in the structure of the YdiI·(UDO-CoA)
complex (Figure A), thus suggesting that release
of benzoic acid before CoA release might be possible.

Rate-Limiting
Chemistry
The apparent rate constant
(kobs) governing the catalytic turnover
of YdiI·(benzoyl-CoA) to YdiI·(CoA)(benzoic acid) was determined
for the reaction of 20 μM [14C]-benzoyl-CoA with
50 μM YdiI at pH 7.5 and 25 °C. The time course for the
single-turnover reaction (Figure ) was fitted
by iterative curve simulation using the reaction sequence YdiI + benzoyl-CoA
↔ YdiI·(benzoyl-CoA) → YdiI·(CoA)(benzoic
acid) in conjunction with the KinTek Corporation Global Kinetic Explorer
software to define the benzoyl-CoA kon = 50–125 μM–1·s–1 and koff =
400–650 s–1, and for the chemical step(s) kobs = 15–19 s–1. The
steady-state kcat = 18 s–1 is in agreement with the range of values defined for kobs. Taken together, the values of the microscopic rate
constants (indicating that substrate binding is not rate-limiting),
the absence of a “burst” phase associated with the first
turnover in the presteady-state multiple-turnover time course (Figure ), and the observed normal solvent (H2O vs D2O) isotope effect on kcat (Hkcat/Dkcat = 1.9 ± 0.1 for YdiI and Hkcat/Dkcat = 2.2 ± 0.1 for YbdB) show that the chemistry, rather
than substrate binding or product release, is rate-limiting.

Divergence of Structural
Determinants of Catalysis and Biological
Function in YbdB and YdiI
In this section, we compare YbdB
to YdiI to identify key differences in structure that support functional
divergence. Next, we contrast the divergence in structure–function
between YbdB and YdiI to that with the evolutionarily more distant Ar 4-HB-CoA thioesterase. X-ray crystallographic structures
of this homolog as well its mechanisms
of substrate recognition and catalysis have been detailed in previous reports.

Substrate Recognition
The respective physiological
thioester substrates targeted by YdiI and YbdB,− namely, 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA and (hydroxy)benzoyl-holoEntB, differ both in the structure of the appendage to the phosphopantetheine
thiol moiety (viz., adenosine-3′, 5′-diphosphate vs
the ACP domain of EntB) and in the structure of the organic acid moiety
(1,4-dihydroxynapthoic acid vs (hydroxy)benzoic acid). The narrow
channel, which leads from the protein surface to the site of catalysis,
binds the phosphopantetheine moiety using desolvation and weak electrostatic
forces derived from close packing to augment the two hydrogen bonds
derived from backbone amide groups (Figure A). Thus, tight binding of the phosphopantetheine moiety is preserved
despite the differences in YbdB and YdiI sequence that exist in this
region (Figure A).

The adenosine-3′,5′-diphosphate
unit of the CoA thioester and the ACP domain of the holoEntB thioester are accommodated by the protein surface formed at
the interface of three of the four subunits that comprise the dimer
of dimers (Figure A). Whereas the YbdB and
YdiI main chain conformations in this region are quite similar, the
steric and electrostatic topological features of the surface are not
(Figure C), and this is because of the divergence
in the sequence in this region (Figure B).
YbdB has evolved recognition of the ACP domain in EntB while maintaining
compatibility with the adenosine-3′,5′-diphosphate moiety
of CoA. Simple inspection of the interacting surfaces does not reveal
the nature of the protein–protein interaction, and thus far,
our attempts to crystallize the complex have not been successful.

Unlike the case of YdiI, the substrate range of YbdB does not include
fatty acyl-CoA thioesters or 1,4-dihydroxynaphthyl-CoA. Such a divergence in substrate recognition might
be attributed to the observed differences in the residues that form
the respective alkyl/aryl unit-binding sites. Of special interest
is the Val68 residue in YdiI, which is replaced by the larger Met68
in YbdB (Figure B; Figure SI8, ). In the companion paper, we reported a ∼50-fold increase in the kcat/Km value for
YbdB M68V-catalyzed 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA hydrolysis compared
to that of wild-type YbdB, and a ∼10-fold increase in kcat/Km value for
YbdB M68V-catalyzed lauroyl-CoA hydrolysis. The additional space in
the YbdB aryl/alky group binding site gained by the mutation is one
possible explanation for the increased activity with the larger substrates.
An alternative possibility is that the replacement of the Met68 with
Val reduces the packing of the hydrophobic side chains in the binding
site, and this in turn promotes the open conformation observed in
the structure of the wild-type YdiI·(UDO-CoA) complex (Figure A; Figure SI9, ). As we pointed out, there exists a
high (although not 100%) correlation of the occurrence of Met68 with
the predicted YbdB proofreader function in the enterobactin pathway
and of Val68 with the predicted YdiI 1,4-DHN-CoA thioesterase function
in the menaquinone pathway.

YbdB, YdiI, and the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE share high
catalytic efficiency toward the metabolite 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, as
is demonstrated by their respective kcat/Km values of 7 × 104, 6 × 105, and 5 × 107 M–1·s–1., Whereas the kcat values for all three homologs are similar
(5, 2, and 7 s–1, respectively), the Km value for the Ar 4-HB-CoA thioesterase
is significantly lower (21, 9, and 0.1 μM, respectively). The
inhibition constants indicate ∼10-fold tighter CoA binding
to YdiI (Kis = 16 μM) (Table ) and to the Ar 4HB-CoA TE (Kis = 29 μM) than CoA binding to YbdB (Kis = 210
μM) (Table ). The three residues that
are responsible for desolvation of the substrate pantetheine moiety
in YbdB match those in the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE, whereas
YdiI possesses a Ser92 in place of the YbdB Pro92 (Figure A) or the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE Pro103
(Figure A). The CoA adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate
binding region also contains residues that the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE shares with one (Ser120 with Ser109) or both (Arg102
with Arg135, Arg102 with Arg91, and His117 with His106) of the homologs
(Figures B and A).
In view of the low overall sequence identity between the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE and the two paralogs, the similarities in their CoA-binding
sites are striking.

The region of the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE that has
undergone
considerable specialization for divergence of function is the aryl/alkyl
moiety binding site (Figure B). The function
of the 4-HB-CoA TE in the 4-chlorobenzoate degradation pathway dictates that the thioesterase discriminates
between the first pathway intermediate 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA (4-CB-CoA)
and its product, 4-HB-CoA, with high efficiency. Indeed, there is a ∼10 000 difference in kcat/Km values that
derives from a comparatively smaller 4-CB-CoA kcat value (0.25 s–1) and a much larger Km value (113 μM). The kcat/Km value for benzoyl-CoA (8 × 103 M–1·s–1) is also ∼10 000-fold smaller
than that for 4-HB-CoA owing, primarily, to the large Km value (240 μM). In
contrast, YbdB and YdiI do not select the ring C(4)OH as indicated
by the observation that benzoyl-CoA and 4-HB-CoA are equally active
substrates. The special tailoring of
the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE aryl group-binding site for optimal
4-HB-CoA binding includes the engagement of the ring C(4)OH in an
extensive hydrogen-bond network (see Figure B)., In contrast, the aryl group binding sites
of YbdB and YdiI are largely nonpolar, and the respective crystal
structures of the respective 2,4-DHP-CoA complexes indicate that the
C(4)OH does not form a hydrogen with a binding site residue (Figure C).

Catalytic Mechanism
The key residues
that form the
catalytic site in YbdB and YdiI are stringently conserved (Figure B). The catalytic site residues of YbdB and YdiI
are matched with their positional counterparts in the catalytic site
of Ar 4-HB-CoA TE (Figure C), save three notable exceptions. Specifically, the His89 of YbdB
and YdiI, which functions (via hydrogen-bond formation) to orient
the catalytic carboxylate residue (Glu63*), is replaced with Phe100
in the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE. The catalytic carboxylate
residue (Glu73*) of the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE is instead
oriented through hydrogen-bond formation with Asn96*, which is located
on the subunit opposite of that which contributes the His89 in YbdB
and YdiI (Figure A). The counterpart to the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE Asn96* is Leu85* in YbdB and Ile85* in YdiI.
Despite the difference in the locations of the respective hydrogen-bond
donors, the orientation of the Glu73* carboxylate group in the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE is the same as that observed for the corresponding
Glu63* carboxylate groups in YbdB and YdiI (Figures A and B). Likewise, the Thr77* and
Gln78 of the Ar 4-HB-CoA TE and the Ser67* and Gln58
of YbdB and YdiI occupy the same positions in the respective catalytic
sites. Despite the similar positioning of these residues, the experimental
probes (viz., transient kinetics and 18O-solvent labeling)
originally used to define the catalytic mechanism of Ar 4-HB-CoA TE proved to be less effective
when applied to YdiI catalysis. Indeed, it is not clear that Glu63*
functions as nucleophile only, or that a competing pathway exists
in which it functions as general base (Scheme ).

Conclusion
What have we learned
with regard to the evolution of substrate
recognition from this comparative analysis? First, we have shown that
YdiI and YbdB, and their distant relative Ar 4-HB-CoA
TE, have retained the CoA-binding site inherited from an ancient (type
AB) clade member, and that this recognition
motif has been conserved in YbdB despite the divergence in structure
which underlies holoEntB recognition. Although the
respective interaction surfaces of the EntB ACP domain with EntD and
EntF have been described,, the EntB ACP–YbdB
interface has yet to be defined. Second, it
is evident that the divergence in the aryl-group binding site is the
basis for the divergence in substrate specificity that supports the
diverse set of biological functions acquired by these three homologs.
Third, the multitasking aryl group binding site discovered in YdiI
(viz., recognition of fatty acyl-CoA as well as aryl-CoA metabolites)
is quite intriguing and warrants further investigation.

What
have we learned about the adaptation of the catalytic mechanism
with evolving substrate recognition? The take-home lesson is that
inherent in the catalytic scaffold of any given hotdog-fold thioesterase
is the potential for catalyzed hydrolysis via a single-step, general
base catalysis pathway and a two-step, nucleophilic catalysis pathway.
We speculate further that the energy profiles for the competing reaction
coordinates are differentiated by subtle differences in local, and
possibly global, residue usage. And thus, along with the sequence
divergence that accompanies the evolution of a new function is the
divergence of catalytic mechanism employed by a conserved constellation
of catalytic residues. A small shift in the position of the substrate
thioester group relative to the catalytic carboxylate group caused
by a switch in the structure of the physiological substrate might
be most readily accommodated by the switch from nucleophilic catalysis
to base catalysis or vice versa.

In this paper, the term “holo” is used to specify that the ACP serine residue
is functionalized with a phosphopantetheinyl group. Also, the term
“(hydroxy)benzoyl” is used in a generic sense to signify
that the organic acid unit of the thioester is benzoic acid or a benzoic
acid adduct that possesses one or two ring hydroxyl groups.

For ease of referencing, the Pseudomonas thioesterase clade has been named “type
AA” to signify that the active site catalytic carboxylate residue
and the thioester-polarizing α-helix N-terminus residue are
contributed by the same subunit of the functional dimer., The Arthrobacter thioesterase clade was named “type
AB” because these two active site residues are located on the
opposing subunits of the dimer.

To date, our attempts at generating
crystals of YbdB in complex with undecan-one-CoA have not been successful.

The respective tetrahedral
oxyanion
intermediates associated with substitution at an acyl carbonyl carbon
are not included in this model because thioesters and anhydrides,
owing to their low-energy anionic leaving groups (viz., thiolate anion
and carboxylate anion, respectively), are reported to undergo concerted
nucleophilic substitution reactions rather than follow the classical
addition–elimination pathway.
