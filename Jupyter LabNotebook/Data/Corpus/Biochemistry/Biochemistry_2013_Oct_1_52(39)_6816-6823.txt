Zinc and
copper are essential
metal ions for most organisms but exhibit a number of important differences.
The biological functions of copper primarily utilize its redox activity,
which contributes to the toxicity of this metal. Redox-inactive zinc is more abundant in biological systems
and is required by many more proteins. The tight binding of zinc and copper to biological metal sites means
that the intracellular availability of both has to be carefully controlled. Copper trafficking generally involves metallochaperones
that deliver the metal to specific targets by ligand-exchange reactions., No zinc metallochaperone is currently known, although metallothioneins involved in zinc storage have been proposed
to also act as a direct source of zinc for target proteins.,

Zinc export from the cytosol of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 occurs via the P-type ATPase
ZiaA. In the same organism, the P-type
ATPase PacS, along with the copper metallochaperone Atx1, traffic
copper to the thylakoids for photosynthesis and respiration., ZiaA and PacS each possess a single N-terminal metal-binding domain
(MBD; ZiaAN and PacSN respectively) structurally
similar to Atx1 in having a M/IXCXXC metal-binding motif anchored
on a ferredoxin (βαββαβ) fold
(Figure ).− ZiaAN is
unusual in having an unstructured C-terminal extension that contains
seven His residues that are involved in Zn(II) binding. We have recently shown that the Zn(II) affinity
of ZiaAN is up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those
of PacSN and Atx1. The Cu(I)
affinities of copper and zinc trafficking proteins in Synechocystis all fall within approximately 1 order
of magnitude at pH 7.0. However, the
Cu(I) affinity of Synechocystis Atx1
is almost 10-fold greater than that of PacSN (and ZiaAN), and this Atx1 can dimerize in the presence of Cu(I),, which enhances its Cu(I) affinity. The
Cu(I) affinities of the trafficking sites are at least 6 orders of
magnitude greater than their Zn(II) affinities, consistent with theoretical studies, yet Atx1 has been proposed to be able to bind zinc in vivo.

(A) Structure of the head-to-head dimer of Cu(I)–Atx1, which is also dimeric in solution., The Cu(I) ions are coordinated by Cys12 and Cys15 from one monomer
and Cys15 from the adjacent chain. The loop 5 His61 residue hydrogen
bonds with Cys15 from the same chain and with Cys12 across the dimer
interface. (B) Structure of PacSN with Cu(I) coordinated
by Cys14 and Cys17, with the loop 5 Tyr65 residue hydrogen bonding
to Cys17. The sequences of the copper
binding motifs and the loop 5 residue in Atx1, PacSN, and
ZiaAN are compared in (C). The Atx1 variants in which the
MXCXXC motifs from PacSN and ZiaAN have been
introduced are called Atx1PacSN (MRCAAC motif)
and Atx1ZiaAN (MDCTSC motif), whereas the PacSN variants possessing the Atx1 and ZiaAN M/IXCXXC sequences are referred to
as PacSNAtx1 (IACEAC motif) and PacSNZiaAN (MDCTSC motif). In all of these variants,
the loop
5 residue has not been changed.

The non-Cys residues in the M/IXCXXC motifs of metal-trafficking
proteins have been implicated in metal binding and transfer.− This includes contributing to Zn(II) coordination in a Zn(II)-transporting
ATPase form Escherichia coli (E. coli), facilitating the rate and extent of dissociation
of the Atx1–Cu(I)–BCA complex [BCA (bicinchoninic acid)
is a tight Cu(I) ligand used as a copper-transfer partner mimic],
influencing the flexibility of this part of the protein, and forming
potentially important hydrogen-bonds, particularly with the Cys ligands.
In this work, we use the Synechocystis system to help understand the importance of the non-Cys residues
in M/IXCXXC motifs on the binding of zinc and copper. We have grafted
the motif from ZiaAN onto both Atx1 (Atx1ZiaAN) and PacSN (PacSNZiaAN) and have swapped these regions between Atx1 and PacSN, giving Atx1PacSN and PacSNAtx1, respectively (Figure C).
These mutations have a limited effect (maximum ∼3-fold) on
Cu(I) affinity. However, introducing the ZiaAN loop has
a dramatic influence on the Zn(II) affinities of both Atx1 and PacSN. In its crystal structure, Zn(II)–Atx1ZiaAN forms a side-to-side dimer with the monomers bridged
by a single Zn(II) ion. The introduced Asp11 residue on the MDC12TSC15 motif is involved in an intermolecular hydrogen
bond with Ser14 from the adjacent molecule. In a crystal structure
of Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN, the
metal ion is coordinated by the carboxylate of the corresponding Asp
residue, which must be the cause of the enhanced Zn(II) affinity.
The comparison of Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN crystal structures provide additional insight into potential
intermediate sites formed during Zn(II) trafficking in Synechocystis.

Materials and Methods
Site-Directed
Mutagenesis
The Atx1ZiaAN, Atx1PacSN, PacSNZiaAN, and PacSNAtx1 mutants (Figure C) were generated using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene)
with pETATX1 (encoding full length Atx1) and pETPACS71 (encoding PacSN, which constitutes the
first 71 amino acids of PacS) as templates
and the primers given in Table S1 in the . Both strands of all DNA constructs were confirmed
by sequencing.

Protein Purification, Reduction, Quantification,
and Analysis
Proteins (including His61Tyr Atx1)
were purified, reduced and quantified as previously reported,,, and the Atx1ZiaAN, Atx1PacSN, PacSNZiaAN, and PacSNAtx1 variants were
verified by mass spectrometry. Far-UV (185–250 nm) circular
dichroism (CD) spectra and analytical
gel filtration chromatography were performed
as described previously. The dimerization constant (Kdim) for Cu(I)–Atx1PacSN was
determined by gel filtration as described previously.

Zinc Titrations and the Determination of
Zn(II) and Cu(I) Affinities
Titrations of Zn(II) into apo-proteins
were performed in 25 mM
4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (Hepes) pH 7.4
plus 100 mM NaCl and monitored for changes in absorbance at 240 nm
on a λ35 UV/vis spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). Zn(II) affinities were measured using the competitive
chelator RhodZin-3 in 25 mM Hepes pH 7.4 plus 100 mM NaCl. Data were fit to a model (eq ) considering a single species (ZnP, where P is the apo-protein)
for Atx1ZiaAN and PacSNZiaAN to obtain the Zn(II) affinity of the apo-protein (KZn) and two species (ZnP and ZnP2, see eq ) for His61Tyr Atx1, Atx1PacSN, and PacSNAtx1 to determine both KZn and the affinity of the apo-protein for zinc-protein
(KZn2). Below are eqs  and :whereand where [L], [P] and
[Zn] represent total
RhodZin-3, protein, and zinc concentrations, respectively, and Kb is the zinc affinity of RhodZin-3.

For
Cu(I) affinity (KCu) determinations, the
chromophoric ligand bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS) was used in 20
mM Hepes pH 7.0 plus 200 mM NaCl. Data were fit to a 1:1 Cu(I):protein
model (eqs  and ),, except in the case of Atx1PacSN, for which
data at multiple Cu(I) concentrations were fit to a model that also
considers dimerization of the Cu(I)–protein (eq ) using a Kdim of 5.7 × 104 M–1 (vide
infra). Below are eqs –:where [L], [P] and [Cu] represent
total BCS, protein, and copper concentrations, respectively, and β
is the formation constant of [Cu(BCS)2]3–.

Protein Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection, Structure Determination,
and Refinement
Atx1ZiaAN (25 mg/mL)
loaded with 1 equiv of Zn(II) in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.0 and 100 mM NaCl
was crystallized anaerobically from 1.6 M trisodium citrate pH 6.5
using the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion (1 μL protein
and 0.5 mL well solution). PacSNZiaAN (10 mg/mL) loaded with 1 equiv of Zn(II) in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.0 plus
35 mM NaCl was crystallized from 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5 plus 10% (w/v)
PEG 4000 and 5% (w/v) isopropanol (condition 1) using the sitting
drop method (250 nL protein and 100 μL well solution). A second
crystal form of Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN was obtained from 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 plus 0.2 M NaF (condition
2). All crystals were frozen using N-paratone oil
as the cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on
beamline I02 at the Diamond Light Source (Didcot, U.K.). The identity
of the metal was confirmed by calculation of an anomalous difference
Fourier map using additional data sets collected both above [high-energy
remote (hrm)] and below [low-energy remote (lrm)] the zinc K-edge
(peak) to confirm the presence and absence, respectively, of the anomalous
signal (Table ). Data were processed and integrated
using iMOSFLM and scaled with Scala., The structures
were solved by molecular replacement using Molrep and 2XMT (Atx1) and 2XMW (PacSN) as the search
models. Final models were produced with
iterative cycles of refinement (Refmac5) and model-building using
COOT.,

Results and Discussion
Protein Purification and
Characterization
Mass spectra
(Table S2 in the ) show that Atx1ZiaAN, PacSNAtx1, and PacSNZiaAN are purified
without their N-terminal Met residue. Atx1PacSN is isolated as a mixture of full length protein and protein missing
Met1 (Table S2 in the ). CD spectra (Figure S1 in the ) demonstrate fully folded proteins and domains in all cases.

Oligomerization
State of the Apo and Metal-Loaded Proteins
For most proteins
studied, the addition of Zn(II) causes a decrease
in absorbance at 240 nm (Figure  and Figure
S2 in the ) in the
UV/vis spectrum [the absorbance at 240 nm does initially increase
upon the addition of Zn(II) to apo-PacSNAtx1 ( Figure S2B)].
This seems counterintuitive considering that the formation of Zn(II)–S
bonds is normally accompanied by an increase in absorbance at this
wavelength due to the appearance of S(Cys)→Zn(II) ligand to
metal charge transfer bands. However,
a number of factors can give rise to changes in absorbance at 240
nm, including the protonation state of the Cys ligands, and the observed
effects are probably the result of several contributing factors. Regardless
of the absolute values, the change in absorbance at this wavelength
upon Zn(II) addition does give insight into the stoichiometry of the
complexes formed. The Zn(II) titrations (Figure  and Figure S2 in the ) show an inflection point at ∼0.5 equiv, followed by a plateau
after 1 equiv, for all proteins except Atx1ZiaAN, for which the decrease in absorbance at 240 nm is linear up to
1 equiv (Figure A). These data indicate the
formation of a single Zn(II)-form (ZnP) for Atx1ZiaAN, as previously seen for ZiaAN, and two Zn(II)-loaded species (ZnP and ZnP2)
for PacSNZiaAN, His61Tyr Atx1, Atx1PacSN, and PacSNAtx1, as found
for wild type (WT) Atx1 and PacSN. Consistent with this, most of these proteins elute as dimers from
a gel filtration column when loaded with 0.5 equiv of Zn(II) (Figure  and Figure S3 and Table S3 in the ), whereas Atx1ZiaAN elutes as a monomer, most probably as a mixture of apo- and
Zn(II)-protein (Figure A and Table S3 in the ). The elution volume of
PacSNZiaAN loaded with 0.5 equiv
of Zn(II) decreases (apparent molecular weight increases) with increasing
protein concentration, consistent with a relatively weak ZnP2 dimer (Figure B and Table S3 in the ). Atx1ZiaAN and PacSNZiaAN elute as monomers
when loaded with 1 equiv of Zn(II) (Figure A,B and Table S3 in the ). All of the other proteins have a greater tendency to dimerize
at the relatively high protein concentrations used for the gel filtration
experiments (90–200 μM) and are recovered with approximately
0.5 Zn(II) equiv (Figure S3 and Table S3 in the ).

Plots of absorbance at 240 nm against
Zn(II) concentration for
apo-Atx1ZiaAN (A, 40 μM) and apo-PacSNZiaAN (B, 50 μM) in 25 mM Hepes
pH 7.4 plus 100 mM NaCl.

Plots of absorbance at 240 nm against elution volume from a gel
filtration column for Atx1ZiaAN (A) and of absorbance
at 280 nm against elution volume for PacSNZiaAN (B). Data were acquired in 25 mM Tris pH 7.5 plus 200
mM NaCl. Data shown for apo-protein (blue line), protein loaded with
1 equiv of Cu(I) (green line), and protein with 0.5 (red line, also
magenta line for PacSNZiaAN) and
1 (black line) equiv of Zn(II) at the loaded protein concentrations
given in Table S3 in the  [PacSNZiaAN with 0.5 equiv of Zn(II)
was loaded at 50 (red line) and 150 (magenta line) μM].

We have previously shown that
although WT apo-Atx1 is a monomer,
when the protein is loaded with 1 equiv of Cu(I) [Cu(I)–Atx1],
it elutes from a gel filtration column as a dimer. However, the elution
volume increases upon lowering the protein concentration below 100
μM, indicative of dimer dissociation in this concentration range,
and an equilibrium constant (Kdim) of
(5 ± 2) × 105 M–1 has been
determined. The mutation of His61 into
a Tyr, the residue in the corresponding position on loop 5 in PacSN and ZiaAN (Figure ), results
in monomeric Cu(I)–Atx1 and a His residue at this key location,
whose side chain hydrogen bonds with the Cys ligands (Figure ), favors dimerization. All of the apo-variants
loaded with 1 equiv of Cu(I) elute as monomers on a gel-filtration
column (Figure  and Figure S3 and Table S3
in the ) except for
Cu(I)–Atx1PacSN, which elutes as a dimer
(Figure S3A and Table S3 in the ). A dimerization constant of (6 ± 1) × 104 M–1 was determined for Cu(I)–Atx1PacSN (Figure S4 in the ), ∼10-fold lower than that of WT Atx1. This lowered dimerization constant for Atx1PacSN and the absence of dimer formation for Atx1ZiaAN demonstrate that residues in the native IACEAC motif
of Atx1 contribute to the stability of the dimer formed in the presence
of Cu(I).

Zinc(II) and Copper(I) Affinities
Introducing the metal-binding
motif of Atx1 into PacSN has almost no effect on Zn(II)
affinity (KZn), whereas replacing the
sequence of Atx1 with that of PacSN decreases the Zn(II)
affinity 3-fold (Figure A and Table ). The His61Tyr Atx1 mutation decreases the Zn(II)
affinity by a similar amount (Table ), and
this loop 5 residue is therefore not involved in Zn(II) binding. The
affinity of apo-protein for Zn(II)-protein (KZn2) is enhanced 2- to 3-fold in Atx1PacSN and PacSNAtx1 but is almost unaltered by the
His61Tyr Atx1 mutation (Table ). The largest
changes in Zn(II) affinity (up to 40-fold) result from introducing
the ZiaAN sequence into PacSN and Atx1 (Figure B and Table ). Atx1ZiaAN has the highest Zn(II) affinity of all the
proteins studied, ∼2- and 15-fold tighter than those of ZiaAN and PacSNZiaAN, respectively
(Table ).

Values
for the monomeric protein
determined from titrating apo-protein into [Cu(BCS)2]3– at multiple Cu(I) concentrations.

The Cu(I) affinity (KCu) of monomeric
WT Atx1 is approximately an order of magnitude greater than those
of WT PacSN and ZiaAN at pH 7 (Table ). Some of this difference
is due to the presence of His61 on loop 5 of Atx1 because replacement
with a Tyr, the residue found in this position in both PacSN and ZiaAN, results in a ∼2.5-fold decrease in
Cu(I) affinity (Table ). The introduction of the metal-binding motif of PacSN has almost no effect on Cu(I) affinity of Atx1, but KCu decreases ∼2- to 3-fold in Atx1ZiaAN (Figure  and Table ). The introduction of the Atx1 loop into PacSN (in PacSNAtx1) does increase the Cu(I)
affinity ∼3-fold (Table ), whereas
the Cu(I) affinity of PacSNZiaAN is
very similar to that of PacSN (Table ). The non-Cys residues in the loop can influence the Cu(I) affinity
by a similar amount as that seen upon mutating the loop 5 residue.
These mutations all change the second-coordination sphere, which has
a small effect on the Cu(I) affinity of copper-trafficking proteins,
with the most important contribution being from residues that can
influence the pKa values of the Cys ligands.,

Titration
of [Cu(BCS)2]3– with apo-Atx1PacSN (A) and apo-Atx1ZiaAN (B) in
20 mM Hepes pH 7.0 plus 200 mM NaCl. In (A), the [Cu(BCS)2]3– concentration ranges from 2.0 to 16.0
μM in the presence of an excess of BCS (46–168 μM).
In (B), the [Cu(BCS)2]3– concentration
is 14.0 μM with an excess of BCS (72 μM) present. The
fit of the data in (A) to eq  using a dimerization
constant (Kdim) of 5.7 × 104 M–1 gives a KCu of
(5.6 ± 0.1) × 1017 M–1, and
the fit of the data in (B) to eq  gives a KCu of (1.8 ± 0.1) × 1017 M–1.

Crystal Structures of Zn(II)–Atx1ZiaAN and Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN
To gain insight into the structural causes of the large
changes in Zn(II) affinity, Zn(II)–Atx1ZiaAN and Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN have been crystallized. Atx1ZiaAN loaded with
1 equiv of Zn(II) crystallizes as a Zn(II)-bridged dimer (Figure ), an arrangement that is probably relevant for
all the ZnP2 forms that we have observed in solution (Table
S3 in the ). This
arrangement (contact area ∼450 Å2) is remarkably
similar to that of the side-to-side Cu(I)2–Atx1
dimer (rmsd for Cα atoms
of ∼0.6 Å for each of the two monomers) even though the
tetranuclear Cu(I) cluster is replaced by a single Zn(II) ion. This
dimer is also very similar to that observed for WT Zn(II)–Atx1, though some of the monomer-monomer interactions
are different [oligomeric (mainly dimeric) forms are commonly observed
in crystal structures of metalated forms of this Atx1,]. The Zn(II) site in the Atx1ZiaAN dimer is
coordinated by Cys12 and Cys15 from each monomer in a tetrahedral
arrangement, with Zn(II)–Sγ distances of ∼2.3–2.4
Å and Sγ–Zn–Sγ angles of 101–121°. The Oδ2 atom of
Asp11 on the mutated motif is involved in an intermolecular hydrogen
bond with Ser14 (Oγ), also from the mutated region.
A further intermolecular hydrogen bond is present between Asn25 (Nδ2) and Ala57 (CO) as in the [Cu(I)2–Atx1]2 structure. The dimer arrangement of Zn(II)–Atx1ZiaAN, with monomers linked by a single metal ion,
is also similar to those seen in crystal structures of metal-bound
forms [Cu(I), Hg(II), Cd(II), or Pt(II)] of human Atx1 (HAH1).,

of Zn(II)–Atx1ZiaAN showing
the Zn(II) site at the dimer interface. The introduced Asp11 residue
is not involved in coordinating Zn(II) but makes an intermolecular
hydrogen bond with Ser14 (not shown). The zinc ion is shown as a gray
sphere with the anomalous density (orange mesh) contoured at 12σ.

Different metal site structures
are found in two crystal forms
of Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN (Figure ). In crystals obtained from condition 1 (a monomer
in the asymmetric unit), Zn(II) is bound by Cys14 and Cys17 from the
MDCTSC motif with Zn(II)–Sγ distances of ∼2.3
Å. Coordination is completed by Asp13 (monodentate) from the
same chain, as well as by His48 from an adjacent monomer, with Zn(II)–Oδ2 and Zn(II)–Nδ1 distances of
1.95 and 2.05 Å, respectively (Figure A). The bond angles range from 104 to 120°, consistent with
tetrahedral coordination.

Structures of the Zn(II) sites in the two different
crystal forms
of Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN. The
monodentate carboxylate ligand in (A) is replaced by a water ligand
in (B), and Asp13 has moved away from the Zn(II) ion. The anomalous
density for zinc is shown (orange mesh) contoured at 5σ.

In the alternate crystal form
(condition 2), the asymmetric unit
contains a dimer with the monomer-monomer interface distal from the
metal site. Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN is a monomer in solution (Figure B and Table
S3 in the ), and
this crystallographic dimer is therefore an artifact. The metal site
structure in this form of Zn(II)–PacSNZiaANis similar to that found in the condition 1 crystal structure except
that Asp13 is replaced by a water ligand with a Zn(II)–O distance
of ∼2.1 Å (Figure B). The carboxylate
group of Asp13 points away from the metal site, is solvent exposed,
and is not involved in any interactions.

Attempts to crystallize
ZiaAN have been unsuccessful,
and NMR studies could not determine the structure of the high affinity
Zn(II) site. NMR has also been used to
investigate the MBD of the related Zn(II)-exporting ATPase from E. coli (ZntA). In this
case a (Cys)2Asp Zn(II) site has been suggested, but because
of the limitations of NMR data, neither the precise Zn(II) coordination
number nor the geometry of the site could be resolved. This NMR study
also suggested the possibility of a water ligand completing the coordination
environment because of the solvent exposure of the Zn(II) site. Surprisingly,
a recent NMR study of cyclic peptides that mimic Cu(I)- and Zn(II)-binding
CXXC motifs (MTCSGCSRPG and MDCSGCSRPG, respectively)
has found that the Asp residue (underlined) coordinates Cu(I) but
not Zn(II). The crystal structures of
Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN are the
first of a Zn(II) site bound by a CXXC motif involved in zinc transport.
These structures provide strong evidence that the Asp residue preceding
the CXXC motif binds Zn(II) in a monodentate fashion and that a water
ligand can occupy the fourth coordination position of a tetrahedral
site in the MBDs of Zn(II)-transporting proteins.

Insight into
Zn(II) Trafficking Provided by the M/IXCXXC Motif Variants
The
sequence of
the metal-binding motif has a much more significant influence on Zn(II)
than Cu(I) affinities, and introducing the ZiaAN sequence
into Atx1 and PacSN increases the Zn(II) affinity by up
to ∼40-fold. This is due to the side chain of Asp13 coordinating
Zn(II), as seen in a Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN crystal structure (Figure A), which
must also be the cause of the higher Zn(II) affinity of ZiaAN. The two crystal forms of PacSNZiaAN have Zn(II) sites with Cys2His coordination, with either
the carboxylate of Asp13 or a water molecule as the fourth ligand.
A carboxylate group has a lower affinity for Zn(II) than Cys and His, consistent with replacement of Asp13 and not
the other ligands by water. The coordination of Zn(II) by Asp18 in
ZiaAN tunes its Zn(II) affinity so that it is tighter than
those of the Cu(I)-trafficking proteins (with two Cys ligands) but
below that of the Zn(II) sensor (His2Asp2 coordination
for SmtB from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus)., It has been suggested that Asp18 prevents
ZiaAN from forming a stable complex with Cu(I)–Atx1. A negatively charged residue close to the CXXC
motif appears to be conserved in ATPases for metals (divalent) other
than copper, and repulsion has been suggested as a common mechanism
to prevent the binding of Cu(I). The presence of an Asp adjacent to
the first Cys of the CXXC motif has almost no effect on Cu(I) affinity,
as it is not required for coordination but is important for Zn(II)
binding. With Zn(II) bound to ZiaAN, the negative charge
of Asp13 will no longer contribute to repulsing Atx1. As observed
in our crystal structures, this Asp can readily dissociate, which
may occur as Zn(II) is subsequently trafficked, allowing the negative
charge to help prevent unwanted interactions (vide infra). The increase
in Zn(II) affinity due to the introduction of an additional Zn(II)
ligand appears to be sufficient to allow the MBDs of zinc and copper
transporters that have very similar structures, to discriminate between these metals. It is therefore likely that
the Zn(II) affinity of ZiaAN (10–10 M)
is in the range of physiological free zinc concentrations in Synechocystis, although this has not been determined.
This is supported by the observation that in E. coli up-regulation of ZntA expression occurs at nanomolar levels of intracellular
free Zn(II), which matches the Zn(II)
affinities of both the MBD and the trans-membrane site of ZntA (∼108 M–1).

The His residue (His48) involved in Zn(II) coordination in the PacSNZiaAN structures belongs to an adjacent
molecule. The recruitment of this His ligand only occurs at the high
protein concentrations required for crystallization [Zn(II)–PacSNZiaAN is monomeric in dilute solution
(Figure B and Table S3 in the )] and is probably replaced
by a water ligand in solution. However, in ZiaAN, His residues
from the unstructured C-terminus interact in solution with Zn(II)
bound to the CXXC site. These interactions
were proposed to either aid metal transfer or alter intramolecular
interactions. The observation that the side chain of Asp13 can be
replaced by water when a His ligand is present highlights the fluxionality
of this Zn(II) site, which will assist Zn(II)-trafficking. Our structures
suggest two possible intermediates involving one of the His residues
from the unstructured region of ZiaAN, which could be important
for zinc transfer. The coordination of Zn(II) by two His residues
from the C-terminal region of ZiaAN (as well as by two
Cys residues) would result in loss of the Asp ligand, enabling it
to maintain a repulsive interaction with Atx1, to potentially hinder
Cu(I) binding.

When the CXXC site of Atx1 binds 1 equiv of Zn(II),
an exposed
Zn(II) site with Cys2(H2O)2 coordination
will be present, which will be susceptible to ligand exchange reactions.
This form may play a role in Zn(II) trafficking as it has been suggested
that Atx1 can bind zinc in Synechocystis. The unsaturated nature of such a Zn(II) site
also makes it prone to coordinating additional ligands, such as Asp18
in ZiaAN. Two additional Cys ligands can also be recruited
from a second protein molecule, as seen in the crystal structure of
Zn(II)–Atx1ZiaAN (Figure ), and as indicated for other proteins in this work, and also
WT Atx1,, by studies in solution (Figures  and , and Figures S2 and
S3 and Table S3 in the ). These tetrathiolate sites are reminiscent of Zn(II) structural
sites, and their buried nature suggests
they have limited functionality for Zn(II) trafficking but may play
a role in storing the metal. However, given the fact that these dimers
are relatively weak, there is likely fast dimer-monomer exchange so
that Zn(II) can be easily accessed for the supply of endogenous Zn(II)-binding
proteins. We have recently shown that
heterodimers between partner proteins (e.g., Atx1 and PacSN) are formed in the presence of Zn(II) and are more stable than the
corresponding homodimers, and may have a role in regulating the activity
of copper-transporting ATP-ases.

Conclusions
The
Zn(II) affinity of the MBD of a cyanobacterial zinc transporter
is greatly enhanced by the presence of an Asp in the metal-binding
motif due to the ability of the carboxylate group of this residue
to coordinate the metal. The Zn(II) site in the MBD seems highly fluxional,
which must be important for trafficking this metal and for other potential
roles that the ligands, and particularly the Asp residue, may need
to perform. The residues in the M/IXCXXC metal-binding motif of copper
and zinc trafficking proteins have little influence on Cu(I) affinity.
