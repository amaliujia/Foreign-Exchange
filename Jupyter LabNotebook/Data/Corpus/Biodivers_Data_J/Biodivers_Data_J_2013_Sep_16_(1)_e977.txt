Introduction
Galichitsa Mt is situated between the lakes Ohrid and Prespa. It is a long, narrow mountain, extending in a North-South direction, continuing in Albania Southwardly. The side of the mountain facing Ohrid Lake is steep, rocky and to a great extent bare, thus resembling the mountains of the Dinaric Alps. This, and the presence of associated dry valleys, makes this part of Galichitsa difficult to access. The opposite, eastern side of Galichitsa, however, is quite different, with slant slopes completely overgrown with forests that go down to the Prespa Valley. Regarding its morphogenesis, the origin of Galichitsa is related to radial tectonic movements that took place in the Tertiary period, when this mountain massif actually developed. The geological structure is mainly limestone. Erosion of the karstic material has left deep traces in the rock, forming all kinds of relief: crevices, hollows, depressions and karstic fields. From a geological standpoint, the island “Golem Grad” situated in Lake Prespa, also belongs to the Galichitsa Mountain, which was split in the past by tectonic movements () (Figs , , ).

The first reports for the spider fauna of Galichitsa Mt. came from ,  and . This information was summarized later by , who reported 83 species. Additional data can be found again in the papers of , , , , ,  and . All these data are summarized by . The aim of this study is to present a review of the spider fauna of Galichitsa Mt. due to critical incorporation of available literature data and unpublished faunistic records carried out by sporadic research in the last 10 years.

Materials and methods
The spider material treated herein comes from two major sources. The first part comprises critical incorporation of all available literature records concerning the distribution of spiders of Galichitsa Mt. The second part comprises original collections made in the last 10 years during field surveys covering most of the territory of the mountain (Fig. , Table ). The spiders have been collected mainly by hand, under stones, by sweeping and sewing (Figs , , ). The names of the collectors: P. Beron (P.B.), G. Blagoev (G.B.), C. Deltshev (C.D.), M. Komnenov (M.K.), S. Lazarov (S.L.), B. Petrov (B.P.), E. Stojkoska (E.S.). and D. Vidincheva (D.V.) are mentioned by their abbreviations in Table . The taxonomic arrangements of the species list follow . The material is deposited in the Natural History Museum (Skopje) and National Museum of Natural History (Sofia).

Analysis
Species composition
A total of 294 species of spiders from 31 families have been found in Galichitsa Mt. New for the mountain are 85 species, 20 of them are also new to the spider fauna of FYR of Macedonia. High species richness was recorded for 5 of the families: Linyphiidae – 40 species, Lycosidae – 37 species, Gnaphosidae – 31 species, Araneidae – 27, and Theridiidae – 24 species (Table ). The degree of exploration of the group in the mountain is about 60%. The number of the species of Galichitsa Mt is high and represents about 45% of the spider fauna of the country (). This is also evident from a comparison with the number of spiders reported from the other mountains in the Balkan Peninsula: West Rhodopes – 418 (38%) ), Pirin – 324 (30%) (), Rila – 280 (26%) (), Central Stara Planina – 270 (25%) ().

Zoogeographical analysis
According to their current distribution the established 294 species can be classified into 16 zoogeographic categories, grouped into 5 chorological complexes (Cosmopolitan; Holarctic; European; Mediterranean; Endemic) (Table , Fig. ). The data concerning the general distribution and the chorological characteristics of spiders are taken from ,  and .

Cosmopolitan species complex
Cosmopolitan species complex (COS + SCO) includes only 6 (2%) species widespread in Europe. While the species Pholcus
phalangioides, Parasteatoda
tepidariorum, Steatoda
triangulosa, and Tegenaria
domestica are connected with human buildings, Prinerigone
vagans can be accepted as a mountain element. The species is well represented in the woodlands and high altitude zones of the mountains. Tetragnatha
nitens was reported from the Galichitsa Mt by , and there is no new data on its distribution in the mountain.

Holarctic species complex
Holarctic species complex (H + P + WP + ECA) is best represented and comprises 196 (66.7%) species. The Palearctic species s. l. are dominant (125 species, 42.5%), followed by Holarctic (44 species, 15%); Europeo-Central Asiatic (18 species, 6.1%) and West Palearctic (9 species, 3.1%).

This complex includes especially widespread species associated with lowlands, woodlands and high altitude zones of mountains. Most of the species are well represented in the mountains. Characteristic mountain elements are Frontinelina
frutetorum, Gongilidium
rufipes, Pityohyphantes
phrygianus, Tenuiphantes
tenuis, Trichoncus
affinis, Drassodes
lapidosus, Haplodrassus
signifer. Some xenotopic species are widely distributed in the mountains and reach the highest summits as aeronauts (). Meioneta
rurestris and Oedothorax
agrestis, which inhabit the mountain zone in dense populations, also belong to this complex.

European species complex
European species complex (E + MSEE + EE + SEE) comprises 49 (16.7%) species. The European species s. l. are dominant (39 species, 13.3%), followed by Southeast European (5 species, 1.7%), Middle and Southeast European (2 species, 0.7%), and East European (3 species, 1.0%).

The complex includes widespread species, which inhabit both lowlands and mountains. Мountain elements are the species Pardosa
albatula, Inermocoelotes
falciger, Inermocoelotes
karlinskii, Malthonica
ferruginea, Malthonica
silvestris, Cybaeus
angustiarum, Zelotes
apricorum. Meta
menardi and Metellina
merianae, found only in caves, can also be placed into this complex.

Mediterranean species complex
Mediterranean species complex (MCA + M + SE + NM + NEM) includes 24 (8%) species. The Mediterranean species s. l. are dominant (12 species, 4%), followed by North Mediterranean (7 species, 2.4%), North-East Mediterranean and (3 species, 1%) and Mediterranean-Central Asiatic and South European (each by 1 species, 0.3%).

The main part of the established species is presented in the lower and dry parts of the mountain, occurring in the xerothermic oak forests and meadows. Characteristic for the mountain zone are: Tmarus
piochardi, Heliophanus
kochii, Heliophanus
melinus, Macaroeris
flavicomis, and Pellenes
moreanus.

Endemic species complex
Endemic species complex (BP+GA) comprises 18 (6.2%) species. The group of Balkan endemic species (16 species, 5.5%) comprises mainly mountain elements, such as: Dysdera
pectinata, Dysderocrates
storkani, Cheiracanthium
macedonicum, Zodarion
ohridense, Zelotes
babunaensis, Xysticus
macedonicus and Pellenes
moreanus. They are characteristic for forest and subalpine parts of the mountain, while Pachygnatha
clerckoides inhabits the coastal vegetation of water basinsin lower parts of the mountain. Centromerus
acutidentatus, Lepthyphantes
centromeroides, Palliduphantes
byzantinus, Palliduphantes
spelaeorum, Palliduphantes
trnovensis, Tegenaria
paragamiani are found only in caves.

The local endemics: Zora
prespaensis and Xysticus
tenebrosus
ohridensis, can be regarded also as mountain elements. They are known from single localities and need additional faunistic and taxonomic studies.
