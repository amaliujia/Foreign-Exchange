Introduction
With many Southeast Asian countries included, Indo-China is among the 34 richest floristic regions of the world (), and its plant diversity is still under investigation. In the region, Myanmar is one of the countries where the floristic work has been insufficiently carried out, so many new species or noteworthy plant collections are still being reported from that country (). In order to explore further diversity of the flora, the present study targeted plant species that have not been recorded from Myanmar but are widely recognized in its neighbouring countries, such as southern part of China and Thailand. A member of an large aquatic genus, Potamogeton L., Potamogeton
distinctus A. Benn. is one of these species.

Potamogeton
distinctus is among the broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species that is widely distributed in East Asia and Southeast Asia, including the southern part of China and Thailand (). Both the only floristic checklist of Myanmar and the first aquatic plants checklist of Myanmar do not include this species but lists morphologically similar other broad-leaved long-petioled species, Potamogeton
nodosus Poir. and Potamogeton
wrightii Morong (, ). Whereas the other reported Potamogeton species from Myanmar can be easily distinguished from Potamogeton
distinctus, e.g., by the shape of submerged or floating leaves, the two broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton can only be recognized with floral morphology because the reliable diagnostic character of Potamogeton
distinctus is the flower with two carpels, which is four-carpellate in the other species (); this characteristic, of course, could not be applied to non-flowering specimens, which many of Potamogeton collections from Myanmar are. This indicates that Potamogeton
distinctus might be misidentifed as one of the other broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species and thus overlooked in the flora.

Potamogeton is known to have aneuploidy, polyploidy, and hybridization (). The different cytotypes, i.e., aneuploids and polyploids, are phylogenetically well clustered (); hence no inter-specific taxonomic confusions occur by aneuploidy and polyploidy. On the other hand, the known numerous inter-specific hybrids may cause a confusion, because the hybrids are in most cases difficult to recognize solely based on morphological investigation (). In Myanmar, although no natural Potamogeton hybrids have been reported, among the listed nine species and two synomyous ones by  or six species by  are Potamogeton
nodosus and Potamogeton
wrightii, both of which are known to hybridize with Potamogeton
distinctus in China (). Hence, taxonomic confusion might have occurred in the inventory of Potamogeton
distinctus in Myanmar with apparent hybridiｚations with the other broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species.

In such cases, analysis of plant DNA sequence data can provide an effective method, that is known as DNA barcoding (e.g., , , ). This method was initially launched to target diverse plant groups with universal DNA markers, e.g., flowering plants (trnH-psbA and the multi-copy internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS): ), vascular plants (matK + rbcL: ), or land plants (matK + rbcL: ). Recently the applications of DNA barcoding shifted to target narrow plant groups with respective unique DNA markers, e.g., Compsoneura of Myristicaceae (matK + trnH-psbA: ), Combretaceae (trnH-psbA: ), Hymenophyllaceae (rbcL, trnSGG, and trnH-psbA: ), mosses (trnH-psbA and rps4: ), Phoenix of Arecaceae (psbZ-trnfM: ), or Viburnum of Adoxaceae (trnH-psbA and nrITS: ). Barcoding studies occasionally lead to discoveries of new records of plants species from surveyed regions (, ). In Potamogeton, four candidate DNA markers were tested and of these nrITS was proposed as the most useful DNA barcoding marker (). The nuclear DNA marker would be applicable for any purposes because almost all Potamogeton species as well as hybrids were distinguishable with this marker (e.g., , , , ). Meanwhile, in order to understand precisely the apparent hybridization events, plastid DNA (ptDNA) markers should be simultaneously applied, so that maternal phylogenetic information would be available (). The candidate markers included atpB-rbcL (), rpl20-rps12 (), and trnT-trnL, trnL, trnL-trnF ().

The present study aimed to assess the potential occurrence of Potamogeton
distinctus and its inter-specific hybrids, if any are present, in Myanmar. To do so, we applied a taxon-specific DNA barcoding method. First, in order to evaluate the utility of selected DNA barcoding markers, we performed simultaneous molecular phylogenetic analyses based on a sample set of precisely identified broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton specimens, occasionally suplimented with some GenBank accessions. Then, using the DNA barcoding markers, we assigned broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton specimens from Myanmar, which could not be identified by morphology due to either the lack of diagnostic floral characters or intermediate vegetative morphology or both. The resulting molecular insights of broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species in Myanmar will be used to document a new record of Potamogeton species for the flora of Myanmar, to discuss the origin and the evolution of hybrids of Potamogeton in Myanmar, and to propose DNA barcoding markers for future Potamogeton studies.

Materials and methods
Plant material
We carried out a field expedition to Myanmar in 2008 and collected four relevant specimens, i.e., broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton specimens, including three non-flowering and one flowering ones in Shan state (Table ). None of the specimens could be morphologically identified as any of three broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species potentially distributed in Myanmar (Potamogeton
distinctus, Potamogeton
nodosus, and Potamogeton
wrightii) due to either the lack of diagnostic floral characters or intermediate vegetative morphology or both. The morphological characters of the unidentified specimens were summarized to facilitate comparison with the three Potamogeton species (Table ).

To evaluate the utility of selected DNA barcoding markers through performing molecular phylogenetic analyses, comparative materials of Potamogeton
distinctus, Potamogeton
nodosus, and Potamogeton
wrightii were collected in Japan, Mexico, and Thailand (Table ). As we failed to collect hybrids of Potamogeton
distinctus, the nrITS data sets of two Potamogeton hybrids were obtained from GenBank: Potamogeton
×malainoides Miki (Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
wrightii) and Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus (). Besides, two outgroup species were selected following  and included into the sample set; those were Potamogeton
lucens L. and Potamogeton
perfoliatus L. Note that four out of the six comparative materials were previously used for molecular phylogenetic analyses ().

The voucher specimens are retained in either of the following herbaria: BKF; MBK; RAF; TI; TNS. Those of  are kept in HIB. Sequences were deposited at the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and their accession numbers and voucher information are given in Table .

DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing
For the newly obtained samples, total genomic DNA was extracted and sequencing of five plastid regions was performed using the procedure outlined by . For the sequencing, previously used accessions were occasionally involved. We selected the following DNA regions that were used in previous molecular studies of Potamogeton as DNA barcoding markers: atpB-rbcL (), rpl20-rps12 (), trnT-trnL, trnL, trnL-trnF (, ), and nrITS (e.g., , , , ). The atpB-rbcL (seven samples), rpl20-rps12 (nine), trnT-trnL (four), trnL (five), and trnL-trnF (five) regions of chloroplast DNA were amplified and directly sequenced using primers atpB-2F and rbcL-2R () for atpB-rbcL (779–787 bp), rpl-20 and 5'-rps-12 () for rpl20-rps12 (794 or 813 bp), and Po-trnT2F () and “b” () for trnT-trnL (807–809 bp), “c” and “d” () for trnL intron (593 bp), and “e” and “f” () for trnL-trnF (403 bp). Note that trnT-trnL was missing from Potamogeton sp. (N. Tanaka &amp; al. 080662).

Sequences of the nrITS were obtained using primers ITS-4 and ITS-5 () under the same conditions used for the phyB amplification in . The total length was 713 bp. On direct sequencing of ten samples, overlapping double peaks were found at the same sites for complementary strands in the electropherograms. These products were cloned using a TOPO TA Cloning kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). At least 16 clones per sample were chosen and their sequences were determined using the same procedure as that used in the first PCR followed by direct sequencing. For the cloned sequences, nucleotides that were not detected by direct sequencing were regarded as PCR errors.

Data analysis
Sequences of the atpB-rbcL, rpl20-rps12, trnT-trnL, trnL, trnL-trnF, and nrITS regions were manually aligned using the simple indel coding method of . Gaps associated with mononucleotide repeat units were removed from consideration in the phylogenetic analysis because of problems related to homology assessment () and because technical artifacts might be responsible for the variation (). One representative sequence was used for accessions having the identical combined sequence.

Phylogenetic analyses were independently performed for data sets of ptDNA (atpB-rbcL, rpl20-rps12, trnT-trnL, trnL, trnL-trnF) and nrITS, respectively. Phylogenetic inference was performed using maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP* 4.0b10 () and Bayesian inference (BI; ) in MrBayes 3.1.2 () as described by ; the only differences were the best-fit model for BI analysis on ptDNA (F81) and nrITS (HKY). The Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was run for 1 million generations for both ptDNA and nrITS data sets. Four incrementally heated chains were used that started from random trees and sampled one out of every 100 generations. The first 25% of the sampled generations (250,000 generations for each data set, respectively) were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining trees were used to calculate a 50% majority-rule consensus tree and to determine posterior probabilities for branches. The data matrices and the MP trees are available from the TreeBASE (S14928).

Taxon discussion
Potamogeton
distinctus shows a wide range of phenotypic plasticity, especially in leaf morphology. It seems to be that the two-carpellate flower, the diagnostic character of the species, is essential for precise morphological identification in the field; identification with vegetative morphology alone is to be avoided (see Discussion).

Analysis
Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on ptDNA and nrITS
The length of the combined five ptDNA regions alignment containing ten accessions totaled 3456 bp, of which two characters were parsimony-informative. Based on this data set, one MP tree (tree length = 27 steps; consistency index = 1.0; retention index = 1.0) and a BI 50% consensus tree were obtained. These trees showed congruent phylogenetic relationships and thus only the MP tree is presented here (Fig. ).

The length of nrITS alignment composed of 20 accessions totaled 645 bp, of which six characters were parsimony-informative. In the phylogenetic analysis of nrITS data set, one MP tree (tree length = 43 steps; consistency index = 1.0; retention index = 1.0) and a BI 50% consensus tree were obtained. These trees showed congruent phylogenetic relationships and thus only the MP tree is presented here (Fig. ).

In both ptDNA and nrITS trees, the three morphologically closely related species were well differentiated from one another. With Potamogeton
lucens and Potamogeton
perfoliatus as outgroup, Potamogeton
wrightii and the clade of Potamogeton
distinctus and Potamogeton
nodosus were clustered (63 MP bootstrap (BS), 1.0 BI posterior probability (PP) in ptDNA; 87 MP BS, 1.0 PP in nrITS). Potamogeton
nodosus from Mexico and Potamogeton
nodosus-related nrITS sequence of Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus HDZY5-7 showed variation, yet the two sequences were clustered each other (62 MP BS, 0.99 BI PP). GenBank accessions of Potamogeton
×malainoides and Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus () have diverged heterogeneous nrITS sequences, and non-hybrid species have homogenous nrITS sequences (Fig. ).

DNA barcoding for broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton specimens from Myanmar
Of the four broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton specimens from Myanmar, two were genetically identical to Potamogeton
distinctus from Japan and Thailand (N. Tanaka &amp; al. 080061, N. Tanaka &amp; al. 080657; Figs , ). Another specimen had Potamogeton
wrightii haplotype and both of the heterogeneous nrITS sequences of Potamogeton
×malainoides (N. Tanaka &amp; al. 080631; Fig. ); the other of the remaining two exhibited Potamogeton
distinctus haplotype and both of the heterogeneous nrITS sequences of Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus (N. Tanaka &amp; al. 080662; Fig. ).

Utility of DNA barcoding markers for Potamogeton species
The combined five ptDNA regions were separately analyzed to facilitate the utility as individual DNA markers. The comparison included nrITS. Between the closely related species, Potamogeton
distinctus and Potamogeton
nodosus, where two nucleotide substitutions were observed in nrITS, atpB-rbcL exhibited one nucleotide substitution, while trnT-trnL showed a difference in mononucleotide repeat unit (Tables , ). Among the three species, in which ten nucleotide substitutions were found in nrITS, atpB-rbcL included one length variation (indel) and two nucleotide substitutions; trnT-trnL region had two mononucleotide repeat units, in which repeat numbers are differed.

Discussion
In order to assess the potential occurrence of Potamogeton
distinctus and its hybrids, if any are present, in Myanmar, the present study applied a taxon-specific DNA barcoding method. The simultaneous molecular phylogenetic analyses successfully distinguished broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species, Potamogeton
distinctus, Potamogeton
nodosus, and Potamogeton
wrightii, as well as hybrids among them, Potamogeton
×malainoides (Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
wrightii) and Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus (Fig. ). The obtained phylogeny is congruent with the nuclear 5S-NTS phylogeny of , the only molecular phylogeny that resolves the three Potamogeton species relationships. Below we will document a new record of Potamogeton species for the flora of Myanmar, discuss the origin and the evolution of hybrids of Potamogeton in Myanmar, and propose DNA barcoding markers for future Potamogeton studies.

Potamogeton
nodosus, a new record for the flora of Myanmar
Applying the comparative samples’ sequence data as DNA barcodes, the broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton specimens from Myanmar were genetically assigned. As a result, two out of four specimens were identified as Potamogeton
distinctus, a widely distributed species in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, including southern part of China and Thailand, but not in Myanmar (). Here we document a new record for the flora of Myanmar.

Hybridization among broad-leaved long-petioled Potamogeton species in Myanmar
The taxon-specific DNA barcoding also revealed two hybrids of Potamogeton in Myanmar, and among which was Potamogeton
×malainoides (Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
wrightii). This hybrid is known from China (), yet a difference is found between the Chinese and Myanmar cases in maternal lineage: Potamogeton
×malainoides from China has Potamogeton
distinctus as a maternal parent (), but that from Myanmar has Potamogeton
wrightii as a maternal parent. This kind of reciprocal hybridizations occasionally occur in Potamogeton, i.e., Potamogeton
×anguillanus, Potamogeton
×fluitans, Potamogeton
×inbaensis, Potamogeton
×lanceolatifolius, Potamogeton
×sudermanicus, and Potamogeton
×suecicus (reviewed in ). In terms of morphology, Potamogeton
×malainoides in Myanmar showed both Potamogeton
distinctus character, i.e., larger number of leaf veins, and that of Potamogeton
wrightii, i.e., the acute to acuminate leaf tip (Table ), and no major differences are found between the reciprocal hybrids (). In other cases of Potamogeton hybrids, reciprocal hybrids are partly distinguishable, e.g., reciprocal Potamogeton
×anguillanus shows no differences in morphology but exhibited differences in drought tolerance (); Potamogeton
×inbaensis with different maternal lines is roughly distinguishable by leaf morphology ().

The other hybrid of Potamogeton identified in Myanmar is Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus. This hybrid is also known from China, yet no maternal lineage was conclusively identified in the previous study (). The present study successfully identified Potamogeton
distinctus as the maternal lineage of this hybrid for the first time. From the morphological point of view, it is difficult to evaluate the morphological intermediacy between the parental species as both species show large phenotypic plasticity in quantitative morphology, e.g., leaf petiole length.

Utility of DNA barcoding markers for Potamogeton species
 reported that nrITS is the most useful marker for DNA barcoding of Potamogeton. The present study verified its utility by distinguishing three closely related species, Potamogeton
distinctus, Potamogeton
nodosus, and Potamogeton
wrightii, as well as hybrids among them (Fig. , Table ). Meanwhile, in order to understand hybridization events precisely, we simultaneously used plastid DNA markers, including those used in previous molecular studies, i.e., atpB-rbcL (), rpl20-rps12 (), and trnT-trnL, trnL, trnL-trnF (, ). Given that atpB-rbcL showed higher utility than the others (Table ), here we propose nrITS and atpB-rbcL as DNA barcoding markers for Potamogeton species. Note that trnT-trnL has similar resolution to distinguish closely related Potamogeton species, yet the differences are found only in mononucleotide repear units, which technical artifacts might be responsible for the variation ().

The taxon-specific DNA barcoding method presented here will be applicable in elucidating further diversity of Potamogeton in other floras. With some modification on marker selection, this method will be also applicable for floras that focus on other taxa.
