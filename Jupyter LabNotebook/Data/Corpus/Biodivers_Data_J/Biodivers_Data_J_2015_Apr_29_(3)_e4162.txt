Introduction
The Rio Nhamundá is one of the south-draining Guiana Shield tributaries of the Rio Amazonas, Brazil. The river is located between the Uatumã-Jatapú and Trombetas rivers (Fig. ), and comprises the administrative border between Amazonas and Pará States. Chemically, the Rio Nhamundá is of the clearwater type (), being poor in sediments, dissolved minerals, and humic compounds ().

The ichthyofauna of the southern Guiana Shield rivers is poorly known in comparison to the northern Brazilian Shield rivers (), and few scientific collections appear to have been made in the area (). One exception is the Trombetas river, which has been extensively surveyed over several years (). Aquarium hobbyists have, however, explored parts of the Rio Nhamundá in search of new discus (Cichlidae: Symphysodon spp.) variants (), and ornamental fishermen currently operate on the river and specialise mainly in the catching of these discus (pers. obs.).

The aim of this study is to assess our current knowledge of Siluriformes (catfishes) of the Rio Nhamundá, and to report the results of a preliminary survey of the lower reaches of the river (i.e. downstream of the last major cataracts).

Materials and methods
Desk survey
In order to assess the current knowledge of the catfishes of the Rio Nhamundá we carried out a survey of Web databases as well as published checklists and literature. The Web databases searched were FishBase (), Catalog of Fishes (), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; http://www.gbif.org). The FishBase and GBIF searches were conducted using the rfishbase 0.2-2 () and rgbif 0.5.0 () packages in the R programming language (); a script to repeat these searches is presented in Suppl. material . The Catalog of Fishes was searched manually using their Web interface (date 05-03-14) using the terms "Nhamundá" and "Nhamunda" to avoid potential discrepancies due to the accent on the last letter. Local searches were performed on PDF copies of the Checklist of Catfishes (), the Check List of the Freshwater Fishes of South and Central America (), and on over 3,500 locally stored articles on Neotropical ichthyology in PDF format (search script is available in Suppl. material ). We additionally checked records for the neighbouring Trombetas and Uatumã rivers using rfishbase, rgbif, Catalog of Fishes, and Checklist of Catfishes. The database at the fish collection of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA) was also searched for catfish records from the Nhamundá drainage.

Field sampling techniques
Fishes were collected during the November 2013 dry season using a combination of methods mostly targeting larger species: gill netting, rod and line fishing, spear fishing, hand netting, and hand catching using snorkelling equipment. Fishes were photographed alive whenever possible following the recommendations outlined in , and were then euthanised using a eugenol (clove oil) solution. Subsequent image manipulation was carried out using GIMP (http://www.gimp.org/), also following . Tissue samples—usually from muscle and fin membranes on the right-side pectoral-fin base—were taken from a subset of specimens and stored in absolute ethanol in the tissue collection of the Laboratório de Evolução e Genética Animal, Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM:CTGA). Fishes to be retained as vouchers were then fixed in 10% formalin before being transferred to 70% alcohol for long-term storage in the fish collection of INPA. Other institutional abbreviations follow .

Description of collection sites
Our survey of the Rio Nhamundá was undertaken at seven main sampling locations on the lower reaches of the river, and these are shown in Fig. . Two distinct environments were observed in our survey area: (1) a narrower, sinuous, and faster flowing upstream section encompassing sampling sites NH05, NH08, and NH04 (Fig. ); and (2) a wider, slow-moving, lake-like lower section of the river encompassing sampling sites NH12, NH02, and NH01 (Fig. ).

Sampling site NH01 comprised a small rocky promontory of a black lateritic conglomerate layer forming part of the island town of Nhamundá (Fig. ). The rocks were broken up into large and small boulders overlying a sand/sediment substrate (Fig. ), and numerous holes were present in the rocks. Water temperature was 32.0°C (daytime), and water movement was minimal. This specific habitat did not appear to be common in the immediate area, at least on the basis of the amount of rock exposed above the water. Sampling site NH02 comprised a floating wooden pen made by ornamental fishermen to house discus before resale, with terrestrial plants overhanging to provide shade for the discus. Sampling site NH12 comprised a rocky outcrop at the base of a hill (Fig. ). Rocks at NH12 were of a soft red lateritic type, and formed piles of large and small boulders above and below the water. Substrate at this site otherwise comprised fine sand and sediment, and water movement was minimal. Sampling site NH10 comprised a sandy beach of the Rio Paratucu, a right-hand tributary of the lower Rio Nhamundá.

Sampling site NH04 comprised a fairly typical representation of the upstream section of the river, mainly characterised by the presence of woody debris (Fig. ), i.e. fallen trees of varying states of decomposition (Fig. ). The river margin substrate was clay/soil, and water movement was moderate to strong depending on how exposed the trunks were to the main river current. Water temperature here was 28.9°C (daytime). Rocky habitats were uncommon in the upstream section of the river, with two exceptions being sampling sites NH05 (Fig. ) and NH08. These comprised two shallow areas of fast flowing water over a substrate of eroded bedrock and sand, forming a network of vertical fissures and crevices. Water temperature at NH05 was 28.3°C (night).

Measurements and meristic techniques
Measurements of preserved material were taken with dial callipers to a precision of 0.1 mm. All measurements and counts for symmetrical features were taken from the left side of the specimen. For loricariids, measurements and meristic counts follow , and terminology for lateral plate rows follows . Terminology of colour pattern follows .

Specimen identification
We used published literature to identify the specimens collected during our fieldwork, and we also provide here the characters found in those references that we used to make each identification. The identifications of the specimens from the INPA collection were also cross-checked. When required, we examined photographs of type material on the All Species Catfish Inventory Web page (http://acsi.acnatsci.org).

We try to keep terminology consistent across species, but also attempt to maintain a degree of agreement with original authors' work in order to aid in referring back to their characters. For example, when reporting the Farlowella, we refer to the "scutes" of  as "plates", following , but maintain reference to the "plates of second lateral row" of  instead of "mid-dorsal lateral plates" of .

We were conservative in applying names to the specimens collected, i.e. individuals were assigned to nominal species wherever possible, especially in cases where no modern literature for the group was available. In order to differentiate undetermined from undescribed species, we use consistent and informative tag-names following  for the latter, and simply "sp." for the former. If a putatively undescribed species could be determined as being allied to a nominal species, we used the "aff." qualifier in order to link the record to other collection events and species. For species with significant inter-individual variation and uncertainty in the identification, we used the "cf." qualifier, although we tried to avoid that wherever possible.

Molecular methods
DNA barcodes were generated for at least one individual per species. Methodology for DNA extraction, PCR and sequencing follows , but using primers FishF1 and FishR2 (). Chromatograms were assembled in Geneious () and aligned manually using the translated amino acid sequence. The nucleotide data was uploaded to GenBank in accordance with their DNA barcode submission tool, and comprises accession numbers KP772569:KP772605.

We also searched the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD; http://www.boldsystems.org/; search term: "Genus species") and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide; search term: "Genus species COI"), in order the evaluate the current coverage of deposited COI sequence data for the fishes we collected (date 20-03-14).

Notes
Identification as a possibly undescribed species similar to Tatia
musaica, follows , , , and  based on the following characters: strongly contrasting dorsal (black) and ventral (white) colour pattern, with irregular lateral pigmentation extending nearly to ventrum; pigmentation extending onto caudal fin lobes as medial stripes; pigmented dorsal-fin spine; bifid third nuchal plate; and long post-cleithral process surpassing the nuchal plates.

Specifically, our specimens differ from T.
musaica as described by  (images can be found on the All Species Catfish Inventory Web page; http://acsi.acnatsci.org/base/image_list.html?mode=genus&amp;genus=Tatia) in at least two aspects: unpigmented area dorso-posteriorly to the orbit (slightly elongated and smaller than orbit diameter); and third nuchal plate larger and unpigmented (including some of the surrounding skin). Our examination of topotypic T.
musaica material from the Río Atabapo of Colombia/Venezuela confirm these differences, in addition to a 5.2% COI sequence divergence (32 mutations over 615 bp). Our Nhamundá specimens are also similar to Tatia
melanoleuca as described by , but differ from this species mainly in respect to the distribution of dark pigmentation on the caudal fin, dorsal-fin spine, and lateral surfaces.

Sixteen individuals were caught either by hand from their lodgements in woody substrates (sampling sites NH04 and NH08), or more effectively using a hand net at the surface after attracting insects—on which they were feeding—with a light (sampling site NH12); under such conditions they appeared abundant on the lower Nhamundá. An example of a live specimen is pictured in Fig. .

Two lots of Centromochlus from the INPA fish collection were collected from the Rio Nhamundá. Both were out on loan at the time of this study and could not be examined here, but the first—36 specimens of Centromochlus sp. "orca" (INPA 35086)—contains a fish clearly conspecific with our T.
aff.
musaica based on the assigned tag name, and so we have included this lot under our T.
aff.
musaica. We were unsure of the identity of the second—a record of a Centromochlus sp. "pigmento" (INPA 35087) referred to by  as Centromochlus sp.—and so have not included this species in the checklist.

Notes
Identification to species level follows  based on the following characters: short post-cleithral process (about 60% of head length) not reaching vertical through origin of dorsal fin; and body colouration dark brown.

Four individuals were caught by hand from their lodgements in woody substrates at the margin of the main river (sampling site NH04). The species was also observed in rocky habitats (sampling sites NH08 and NH12), but were more difficult to catch in this situation. An example of a live specimen is pictured in Fig. .

Notes
Identification to species level for this specimen could not be adequately made using morphological characters due to the small size of the immature specimen. However, rather than exclude the individual, we compared the DNA barcodes to the COI sequences presented by  in their doradid phylogeny. The specimen clustered with, and was 1.36% divergent from (seven mutations in 516 bp), Scorpiodoras
heckelii (GenBank KC555695), and is most likely conspecific given the known distribution of the species and its congeners ().

Notes
Identification to species level follows  and  based on the following characters: rounded caudal fin with larger lower lobe; distinct cranial fontanelle; maxillary barbels long, extending to caudal (extended only to caudal peduncle in our specimen); dorsal spine notched anteriorly; dark stripe along lateral line (in our specimen this comprised just a elongated blotch under the dorsal fin); base of caudal with dark bar; and obliquely angled dark saddle behind head (from dorsal insertion to base of opercle); and body and fins irregularly mottled.

One individual was caught by hand-net on the Rio Paratucu (sampling site NH10), and delivered a painful sting, confirming that many heptapterids are venomous (). This specimen is pictured in Fig. .

Notes
Tentative identification to genus level follows  and  based on the following characters: occipital process narrow, reaching dorsal plate; fontanel continued to base of occipital process, with bridge above the posterior margin of the eye; dorsal-fin and pectoral-fin spines strong; humeral process spine-like; and dorsal fin with six branched rays.

Given the large diversity of the group, and the paucity of modern treatments dealing with heptapterids, we are currently unable to identify this fish to species level, and our genus identification is tentative. Important characters include the caudal fin lobes of approximately equal length, maxillary barbels not surpassing anal fin (left barbel is damaged in our specimen), the complete lack of dark longitudinal stripe, the wedge-shaped mark on the dorsal-fin, and the dark saddle anterior to the dorsal fin.

One individual was caught by hand-net on a sandy beach habitat (adjacent to sampling site NH05). This specimen is pictured in Fig. .

Notes
Identification to species level follows , and  based on the following characters: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; snout naked with fleshy tentacles lacking odontodes; 8-9 branched dorsal-fin rays (three individuals with nine rays and eight individuals with eight rays); and black colour with small white dots (apparent on body and fins in life, but only apparent on abdomen in preserved material).

We note that Ancistrus, and particularly the Amazonian species, are a group in dire need of taxonomic revision.

Eleven individuals were caught by hand on both woody (sampling site NH04) and rocky substrates (sampling site NH01). The species appeared abundant throughout the river. An example of a live specimen is pictured in Fig. .

Notes
Following , , , , , and  we report the following combination of characters allowing a genus-level identification only: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; snout naked with fleshy tentacles lacking odontodes; body and head wide and extremely flattened; snout long and pointed; seven branched dorsal-fin rays; six branched pectoral-fin rays; eyes large (orbit diameter approximately 20% of HL) and situated high on the head; narrow gill openings; and colouration black, with small yellow-white dots in life.

Among the superficially similar nominal Ancistrus—e.g. A.
dolichopterus Kner, 1854, A.
hoplogenys (Günther, 1864), A.
leucostictus (Günther, 1864), A.
lithurgicus Eigenmann, 1912, A.
macrophthalmus (Pellegrin, 1912), and A.
ranunculus Muller, Rapp Py-Daniel &amp; Zuanon, 1994—this fish is most similar in the shape of head and eyes to A.
macrophthalmus and A.
lithurgicus. However, the fish collected from the lower Nhamundá had just three branched anal-fin rays, compared to four for both of these species. More individuals will need to be collected, and further investigation of available names in Ancistrus carried out in order to discover if this indeed represents an undescribed species.

Two individuals were caught by hand at night from rocky substrates (sampling site NH01). An example of a live specimen is pictured in Fig. .

Notes
Identification to species level follows ,  and  based on the following characters: lateral plates with well-developed keels; hypertrophied odontodes present along snout margin; three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; large interorbital distance; pronounced medial ridge on snout; head plates with sinuous rows of odontodes; interopercular plate with between 15 and 20 strong and distally hooked odontodes; pectoral spine roughly same length as head, with long odontodes; and spots on body roughly same size as those on head.

Nine individuals were caught by hand from woody substrates (sampling sites NH04 and NH08). In addition to the main river stem, the species was also observed in lake and igarapé habitats, and appeared abundant. It was not found in association with rocks.

Collins; Event: eventDate: 2013-11; Record Level: institutionCode: INPA; basisOfRecord: PreservedSpecimen

Notes
Following  and  we report the following combination of characters allowing a genus-level identification only: five rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; lateral plates not keeled; dentaries forming angle of &lt; 90°; dentary teeth almost twice as long as premaxillary teeth; dentary teeth widely spaced with medial gap between tooth cups as wide as the tooth cups themselves; supraorbital crests very distinct; dark E-shaped pattern on snout (irregular in some individuals); pattern on body of oblique dark bands (almost horizontal wavy stripes in some individuals), with dark bands generally wider than pale bands (i.e. body more dark coloured than pale coloured); dorsal fin with complete bands; and caudal fin with dark vertical bands.

The Hypancistrus from the Nhamundá is ostensibly similar to Hypancistrus
furunculus Armbruster, Lujan &amp; Taphorn (2007), but we hypothesise that it represents a distinct species from H.
furunculus due to the pronounced supraorbital crests, wide gap between the dentary tooth cups, and colour pattern of wide dark bands and thin pale bands. We await the description of a number of similar species from the Brazilian Shield rivers, some of which may end up being more closely related to this fish than H.
furunculus is. The species is known in the aquarium trade as Hypancistrus sp. "L475" ()

Twelve individuals were caught by hand at night from rocky substrates (sampling site NH01). Four examples of live specimens are pictured in Fig.  to illustrate variation in colour pattern.

Notes
Identification to species level follows  based on the following characters: evertible cheek plates with &gt; 10 hypertrophied odontodes; dentaries forming angle of &lt; 90°; deep body, not dorso-ventrally flattened; lips lacking fimbriae; villiform teeth of equal size in premaxilla and dentary; colour pattern of four irregular dorsal saddles (first and second are usually combined in small specimens); dorsal and caudal fins without orange margin (in life); head plates not outlined in black; dark bar between eyes, e-shaped dark blotch on the snout (broken in some specimens); and fins with dark and light bands of approximately equal width (irregular in some specimens).

An interesting observation is that our specimens exhibited variation in terms of the degree of abdomen plating and markings: adult specimens from collection points near the mouth of the river (sampling sites NH01, NH02 and NH12) showed complete abdominal plating and a vermiculated pattern (Fig. , ); those from further up the river (sampling sites NH04, NH05 and NH08) lacked abdominal plating and associated colouration (Fig. , ), with the exception of one individual that was partially plated with discrete spots (Fig. , ). In light of this variation we were hesitant in referring all these individuals to Peckoltia
vittata, and hence we use the "cf." qualifier. The three DNA barcodes we generated from the different phenotypes/sites, however, were identical.

Twenty-eight individuals were caught by hand from both woody substrates (sampling sites NH02, NH04, NH05, and NH08) and rocky substrates (sampling sites NH01 and NH12). Two further specimens of this species are reported from the collection of fishes at INPA.

Identification to genus level follows  and  based on the following characters: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; lateral plates without pronounced keels; fully plated snout lacking tentacles; hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males; lack of whisker-like odontodes on the cheek plates; extremely hypertrophied odontodes on an elongated pectoral-fin spine in both females and males; sucking disk without fimbriae; and greater than 20 teeth per jaw ramus.

Using the above references we were unable to identify the specimens to species level, as the individuals differed from the colour patterns diagnostic of the other species in the genus. We hypothesise that these individuals represent a new species of Pseudolithoxus, and intend to document this in more detail in a separate publication.

Seventeen individuals were captured by hand from crevices in rocky habitats exposed to strong current (sampling site NH08). Live colouration is shown in Fig. .

Collins; Event: eventDate: 2013-11; Record Level: institutionCode: INPA; basisOfRecord: PreservedSpecimen

Notes
Identification to species level follows  and  based on the following characters: seven predorsal plates; dorsal fin located opposite anal fin; three rows of abdominal plates; five rows of anterior lateral plates, with middle row incomplete; plates of second lateral row diamond-shaped; fourth row of anterior lateral plates sharply keeled; odontodes on lateral plates small; snout-mouth-length / head-length &gt; 0.5; body-depth / pelvic-fin-length &lt; 0.86; pectoral-fin-length / snout-mouth-length &gt; 0.65; snout-mouth-length / pectoral-fin-length &gt; 1.0; and fin spines and rays with dark spots.

The above characters are consistent with F.
nattereri, but some key differences in colour pattern are noted.  report: for most specimens of F.
nattereri, the first anal and dorsal fin rays are entirely darkly pigmented (our specimen has spotted rays); a distinct dorso-lateral dark-stripe is present from base of snout to dorsal fin (this stripe was not apparent in the preserved specimen, but was observed in life); and upper and lower caudal fin lobes pigmented with dark stripes of equal size, with stripes often not reaching caudal fin base (the stripes in our specimen reached the caudal base).  recognise that F.
nattereri probably comprises a complex of species.

One individual was caught by hand from shallow, fast flowing water over a rocky/sandy substrate (sampling site NH05). The live specimen is pictured in Fig.  (caudal fin in Fig. )

Notes
Identification to species level follows ,  and  based on the following characters: lower jaw not projecting beyond upper jaw; head large and rounded in dorsal view; head and body with numerous small papillae; insertion of pelvic fin though vertical of posterior base of dorsal; short caudal peduncle; rounded caudal fin; post-cleithral process short, not reaching vertical through dorsal fin origin; axillary pore absent; lateral-line canal terminating on caudal peduncle; premaxillary dentigerous plates with lateral margins posteriorly prolonged; colour brown, with dark mottled appearance; and caudal fin with dark dots irregularly distributed.

An important inconsistency should be noted regarding the caudal fin shape.  described the caudal fin of B.
villosus as being "notched", but figured a specimen with a rounded caudal fin (). The photograph of the holotype (FMNH 53219) on the All Species Catfish Inventory Web page (http://acsi.acnatsci.org/base/image_list.html?mode=genus&amp;genus=Pseudopimelodus) shows a fish lacking most of the caudal fin.

Trichomycteridae

Notes
Record follows data from .

Analysis
Desk survey
Our survey of the online databases revealed a single species record from the Rio Nhamundá: an unidentified Ossancora (Doradidae) which on further investigation was found to comprise two paratype lots of Ossancora
asterophysa Birindelli &amp; Sabaj Pérez, 2011 (ROM 88244, MZUSP 7838). The literature survey revealed three further species from the river: Hassar
orestis (Steindachner, 1875) (MZUSP 9547); Pygidianops
amphioxus de Pinna &amp; Kirovsky, 2011 (MZUSP 104675); and Centromochlus sp. (INPA 35087). By contrast, the survey of the Web databases and checklists for the Trombetas river listed 44 siluriform species, while the study of  listed 95 siluriform species from the Trombetas. From the Uatumã river, the desk survey of Web databases and checklists provided five species.

The collection of fishes at INPA held nine lots of catfishes previously collected from the Nhamundá. One of these records (Centromochlus sp., INPA 35087) was also recorded in the literature survey (). As stated previously, because this lot was out on loan at the time of writing this manuscript, we were not able to examine the specimens and have therefore omitted this species from the total species count due its ambiguity.

Our review of the genetic databases shows GenBank holds COI data for nine of the 24 species we obtained DNA barcodes from and identified as a known species (number of records in parentheses): Trachycorystes
trachycorystes (1), Astrodoras
asterifrons (1), Scorpiodoras
heckelii (2), Farlowella
nattereri (1), Peckoltia
vittata (1), Phractocephalus
hemioliopterus (1), Pinirampus
pirinampu (7), Pseudoplatystoma

villosus (1). The BOLD database also holds COI data for nine species: Farlowella
nattereri (3), Loricaria
cataphracta (5), Peckoltia
vittata (16), Pseudoloricaria
laeviuscula (3), Rineloricaria
lanceolata (3), Phractocephalus
hemioliopterus (4), Pinirampus
pirinampu (10), Pseudoplatystoma

Discussion
Inventory of Siluriformes
Our desk and museum collection surveys show that few ichthyological surveys of the Rio Nhamundá have taken place, and that our collection is one of the first to be made on the river. Not including the unverified Centromochlus sp., we report three species from the desk survey, eight species from the museum survey, and 28 species from our field survey; three species (Tatia
aff.
musaica, Peckoltia
cf.
vittata, Pseudoloricaria
laeviuscula) were recorded from both the museum and field surveys. Therefore, a total of 36 siluriform species are currently known from the river. Of these, one we were unable to determine (Pimelodella sp.), and four we suggest could represent undescribed species (Tatia
aff.
musaica, Ancistrus sp. "INPA 43862", Hypancistrus sp. "INPA 43863" and Pseudolithoxus sp. "INPA 43888").

The checklist is far from complete, however, missing entirely families such the callichthyids and aspredinids, although we sampled habitats most likely to yield these groups, such as igarapés, only superficially. Despite this, we feel that rapid publication of even modest datasets and small-scale surveys can make valuable additions to biodiversity science in the Amazon by both presenting the early discovery of new species and the extension of ranges for known species. The study also highlights the paucity of neotropical ichthyological data in GBIF/GenBank, and makes a small contribution.

Biogeography
The biogeographic composition of the collection is interesting. While many of the species recorded were cosmopolitan inhabitants of the lowland Amazon—e.g. Auchenipterichthys
longimanus, Goeldiella
eques, Hypoptopoma
incognitum, Lasiancistrus
schomburgkii, Loricaria
cataphracta, Pseudoloricaria
laeviuscula, Rineloricaria
lanceolata, Calophysus
macropterus, Pimelodus
blochii, and Phractocephalus
hemioliopterus—there are suggestions of connections to more specialised faunas. For example: the presence of Ancistrus
dolichopterus and Dekeyseria
scaphirhyncha suggests links to the Rio Negro fauna; Tatia
nigra, on the other hand, is only known from the neighbouring Uatumã and Trombetas rivers, both south draining rivers of the Guiana Shield; two species—Tatia
aff.
musaica and the undescribed Pseudolithoxus sp.—appear to have some connection with the Río Orinoco; while the presence of Leporacanthicus
galaxias in the Nhamumdá is strange, and may shed some light on its apparently disjunct distribution in the Rio Tocantins,—a north-draining Brazilian Shield river some 2,000 km to the east—the Río Orinoco (), and apparently also the Rio Aripuanã, an affluent of the Rio Madeira (). Thus, the ichthyofauna of the Rio Nhamundá appears to have some interesting affiliations to several faunal areas. This is perhaps exemplified by the best known fish from the river, the discus (Symphysodon spp.). Specimens exported from this locality are famous in the aquarium trade for their phenotypic variability (). Genetic groups of both the Heckel (S.
discus) and brown (S.
aequifasciatus) discus species are found in sympatry in the Rio Nhamundá, an area that may in fact comprise a zone of natural hybridisation between the two species ().

In summary, the Rio Nhamundá may therefore be an important sampling location for uncovering biogeographic patterns of fishes of the Lower Amazon and Guiana Shield. Of more urgent importance, however, is the sensitivity of freshwater ecosystems to anthropogenic activities and the requirement for catchment-specific conservation plans (). Here, even rapid biodiversity surveys are of upmost importance in revealing alpha diversity (), with these surveys being subsequently used to inform conservation priorities (). In particular, further surveys are required in the upper section of the Rio Nhamundá above the cataracts, an area that may well harbour endemic or range-restricted species ().

We thank Manoel Torres for the use of his boat, as well as Silvio, Maria and Moura for their assistance, hospitality, and collecting expertise during our trip on the Rio Nhamundá. We also thank John Friel, Nathan Lujan, Jonathan Armbruster, José Birindelli, and an anonymous reviewer for suggesting improvements to the paper. We are also grateful to Cláudio Zawadzki for offering his advice with the identification of the Hypostomus, and to Renildo Ribeiro de Oliveira and Lúcia Rapp Py-Daniel for assisting our access to the INPA collection. Permits emitted to Susana Caballero Gaitán (UniAndes) allowed us to collect the topotypic Tatia
musaica from the Río Atabapo.
