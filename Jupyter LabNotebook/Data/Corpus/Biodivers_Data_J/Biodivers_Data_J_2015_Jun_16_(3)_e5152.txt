Introduction
Upon description by , the genus Aristathlus included two species: A.
imperatorius
 (type species of the genus by original designation) and A.
regalis
.  revised the genus Aristathlus and provided redescriptions and diagnoses for the species, as well as detailed documentation of the male genitalia.

While  regarded Aristathlus as close to Zelus,  provided notes comparing these two genera with each other and also with another four Neotropical harpactorine genera with elongate bodies and heads (Atopozelus
, Ischnoclopius
, Iquitozelus
, and Heza
).  concluded that the species of Aristathlus do not belong in these genera because of the particular structure of the head, legs and genitalia.

Aristathlus
imperatorius, originally described from French Guiana, has been recorded from Brazil (states of Amazonas, Pará, and Mato Grosso) (), Colombia, and Peru (). This species shows variation in pronotal color pattern, ranging from a narrow, median U-shaped pale or yellowish marking, to a wider marking reaching the humeral angles (), as well as the metanotum, which is yellow or sometimes black ().

Reduvius
iopterus Perty, 1834 was described from the region of the Rio Negro (a river in the Amazon region of Brazil), and its original description was accompanied by a dorsal habitus drawing () (Fig. ).  included this species in the genus Zelus Fabricius, 1803, and since then, it has been listed in catalogues as Z. iopterus () (, ​, ).

The type specimen of Reduvius
iopterus ought to be deposited at the Zoological Collection in Munich, as are many of Perty's type specimens, but it is now considered lost ().  were also unable to locate the type specimens of A.
imperatorius.

Taxon discussion
Given that Perty’s type specimen is lost, we base our conclusions on Perty's original description and illustration of R.
iopterus () (Fig. ). We also examined several specimens identified as A.
imperatorius (Fig. ,  and ). The examined material is deposited in the following institutions: American Museum of Natural History, New York, USA (AMNH), Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia (ICN), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (MNRJ). From our examination of the specimens of A.
imperatorius, we conclude that this species is a junior subjective synonym of Reduvius
iopterus.

Both  and  described or illustrated the same color pattern and body structure for both R.
iopterus and A.
imperatorius. The main congruent aspects are the pale or yellowish U-like pattern on the dark posterior lobe of the pronotum, the yellow scutellum, the dark hemelytra, the metallic colored hemelytral membrane, and the swollen mesofemur () (Figs , ).

There is no doubt that a synonymic proposal would be better based on the examination of the type specimens of the taxa involved. However, the identities of the known species in Aristathlus are not in dispute, even though Bergroth’s type specimens for both species have not been located and may be lost ().

Neotype designations have to be done carefully (). Article 75 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature () clearly states that if there is no complex problem to be resolved (such as the identity of a taxon), there should not be any neotype designations (Article 75.2). Because the identity of Aristathlus species is not in dispute, we therefore refrain from designating such neotypes.

The taxonomic revision was carried out by accurately examining the differences between male gentalia of the two species involved. These differences are congruent with the color patterns exhibited by each of the species. Therefore, color pattern is an accurate way of identifying species in Aristathlus even when no other morphological data are available, which is the situation faced here. As far as we are aware, there are no species of Neotropical Harpactorini that could be confused with R.
iopterus or A.
imperatorius, based either on the coloration pattern or on the body and leg structure. Reduvius
iopterus cannot be confused with the other species of Aristathlus, A.
regalis, since it is easily distinguished from R.
iopterus or A.
imperatorius by its conspicuous yellow markings, including a transverse yellow band on the corium (​). We regard the evidence presented sufficient to warrant the synonym proposed here.

Discussion
Even though we have not examined the type specimens for these two species, the original descriptions (, ) and the illustration from () (Fig. ) allow us to confidently propose the synonymy suggested above, given that the color pattern and leg structure are the same in the two named species.

It is also noteworthy that both taxa were recorded from the Amazon region, in which there is no other species known to us with the same general coloration and body structure, which reinforces the present synonymy. The superficial resemblance of Aristathlus to Zelus in the elongated body, as suggested by , was possibly the reason why Reduvius
iopterus was placed in Zelus (as Zelus
iopterus) by .

Finally, in accordance with Article 67 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (), A.
imperatorius Bergroth, a junior synonym of A.
iopterus (Perty) still remains the type species of Aristathlus Bergroth.
