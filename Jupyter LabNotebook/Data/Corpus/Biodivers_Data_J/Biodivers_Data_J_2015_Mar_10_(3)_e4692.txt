Introduction
Fairyflies (Hymenoptera: Chalcidoidea: Mymaridae) are internal egg parasitoids of insects except two species that parasitize the larvae of eulophids (). From India, 31 genera and 134 species of Mymaridae have been reported so far (, ). The mymarid fauna of India is not well documented as several states and biodiversity rich areas of India have not been surveyed so far for mymarids. Because mymarids are small to tiny, only Malaise traps and yellow pan traps yield good field collections. In this paper, we document new records of mymarids for the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. One species, Dicopus
longipes (Subba Rao), is reported as new to India.

Materials and methods
Parasitoids were collected from Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Palakkad, and Idukki districts of Kerala and Coimbatore and Salem districts of Tamil Nadu using sweep netting, yellow pan traps and Malaise traps in different ecosystems (). Collected specimens were processed using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) () and card/slide mounted for identification. Voucher specimens are deposited in the reference collections of the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (ICAR-NBAIR), Bangalore, India and the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Western Ghat Regional Centre, Calicut, India.

Diagnosis
Dicopus
longipes (Fig. ​​) differs from D.
noyesi Manickavasagam by the following features: antennal scape uniformly slender (distinctly bulging subapically in D.
noyesi), F1 almost as long as F2 (distinctly shorter in D.
noyesi), F6 and F7 slightly bottle shaped, the apex of each segment shorter and wider (F5 to F7 bottle-neck shaped, the apex of each segment distinctly long and narrow in ​D. noyesi).

Distribution
​ Malaysia (); India (Kerala).  have mentioned that D.
longipes is known from India, but it appears to be incorrect. After  described it from Malaysia-Sabah under Kubja, the only subsequent reference to this species was by  when he synonymised Kubja with Dicopus.
