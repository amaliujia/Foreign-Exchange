Introduction
According to the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ 2012 - http://www.monclimatmasante.qc.ca/situation-au-québec.aspx), several climate changes are expected in the 21th century in Québec province and adjacent areas: a) winters beginning later and ending earlier, b) winters generally getting milder, c) summers getting longer and hotter, d) thunderstorms becoming more numerous, often with heavier rain, and e) more snow on the ground in the north, and less in the south. Late winters with milder conditions are beneficial for insect species and allow them to be on the wing later than usual during a season, especially during fall. Such late-flying species exist in the family Hemerobiidae (Neuroptera), a family of small soft-bodied insects, often referred to as the brown lacewings. The native Micromus
posticus (Walker, 1853) belongs to this family. The purpose of this paper is to provide new information on its distribution and new phenology in Québec. This paper is the first in a series in which the senior author is planning to review species that are changing their northern distribution range due to climate warming.

Materials and methods
Micromus
posticus was rare in the surveyed area. No specimens were seen or collected from 2007 to 2010. Only three specimens were collected in 2011. Their collection data are given below and in order to compare these captures with specimens collected elsewhere, the data of the latest specimens preserved in public collections in Québec, and in the Canadian National Collection, in Ottawa, are compared in Table .

Habitat
An acre of original mixed forest was continuously monitored from 2007 to 2011 using a black light trap permanently operating from March to December, 10 funnel Lindgren traps installed year round throughout the lot, and 10 yellow pan traps set on the ground since 2007 and maintained year round exactly in the same location during this study. The experimental lot is located on private land in Aylmer, Québec (45° 24' N; 75° 50' W), on the north shore of the Ottawa River, 10.5 km northwest of the national capital Ottawa (Ontario).

The studied area consists of a mixed forest on a limestone outcrop. The red cedar (Thuya
occidentalis) is the dominant tree but white spruce (Picea
glauca) and hemlock (Tsuga
canadensis) being the largest and the oldest on the lot, and approximately 140 years old. The white spruce are at the end of their life span and are often knocked down by the ice storms, heavy snow and strong winds. The hemlock is much more resistant to environmental conditions, are still standing healthy and are less prone to climatic damage. Balsam firs (Abies
balsamea) are common too but are small, and often rotting inside for an unknown reason. Scattered hardwoods include sugar maple (Acer
saccharum), bitternut (Carya
cordiformis), red oak (Quercus
rubra), aspen (Populus
tremuloides), American linden (Tilia
americana) and several small ironwood trees (Ostrya
virginiana). In the northern portion of the lot, the canopy is more open and the undergrowth of a small area is infested with numerous black buckthorns (Rhamnus
frangula). Vinegar-tree sumacs (Rhus
typhina), are confined to the sides of the main entrance and the northern side, established after the entirely forested lot was partially opened for the construction of the house. Tatarian honeysuckle bush (Lonicera
tatarica) are scattered in an area whereas there are only two individuals of the red-berried elder (Sambucus
pubens) which badly suffered and almost died during the 2012 long summer drought. The undergrowth is not very rich because the litter is rapidly processed and considerably reduced by earthworms and also due to the closed canopy which does not allow much light to reach the ground. In addition, the soil dries out almost every summer, sometimes deep, supporting only a few herbaceous plants which can resist such adverse ecological conditions. Nevertheless, the large-flowered trillium (Trillium
grandiflorum) is the most noticeable herbaceous plant among the spring flora. The poison ivy (Toxicodendron
radicans) resists summer droughts and forms a thick mat behind the house, and the large-leaved aster (Aster
macrophyllus) is the most common flowering plant among the fall undergrowth.

Diagnosis
Body length: 6-7.5 mm; wing span: 10-20 mm. Head, body and appendages yellow to brownish, wings brownish (Fig. ). Fore wing with radial sector (Rs) bearing 4 main veins; distance between the inner gradate cross-veins not more than their length (Fig. ); hind wing hyaline without maculation (Fig. ). Male ectoproct with a styliform and slightly dorsally produced ventral lobe (Fig. ); gonarcus with two spine-like anterior structures with and lateral triangular indentation and a broadly oval dorsal projection (Fig. ). For more details and extensive description see .

Discussion
The status of so called "rare" species is often difficult to establish in fall occurring species because very little collecting is made in September, and almost never in November or December. Consequently, a proportion of the apparent rarity of a species may not be real but due to the lack of appropriate collecting events. Nevertheless, Micromus
posticus seems truly rare since only 49 specimens (Ontario, 23 specimens; Québec, 26 specimens) were collected in these two provinces over the last 100+ years, on the basis of specimens housed in public collections (Table ).

Although Micromus
posticus has been reported from British Columbia and Yukon, the majority of the known collection sites, are located along the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system (). In Ontario, all known localities are spread between Lake Erie and Ottawa. In Québec, the known distribution of this species is restricted southwest to the vicinity of Aylmer, and eastwards to around Montréal Island (Fig. ). Aylmer represents a new locality record for Québec.

The collection dates on the 2nd and 8th November for Aylmer specimens constitute new collecting records for this species. In comparison, the latest previously known specimen was collected on November 1st, 1983 (Table ). However, it must be pointed out that its collection locality, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, is 148 km east of Aylmer and represents on average warmer area. The latest capture, in Old Chelsea, a village 12 km north of Aylmer, took place on October 17. In Ottawa, 11.5 southeast of Aylmer, the latest known specimens was captured on October 15, 1961. In conclusion, our collecting of Micromus
posticus in Aylmer, November, was 1-7 days later than any of the known specimens collected from Québec and 16-22 days later than those collected in the neighbouring localities. According to , the northward migration of trees in the eastern United States is currently underway. In regards to insects, the relaxed cold limitations should favour some pests (), but native species should be favoured as well. If this anticipated scenario of species changing their distribution limits northwards continues, Micromus
posticus will fly over the latitudes of Aylmer or Montréal more often and will get permanently established there in a near future.
