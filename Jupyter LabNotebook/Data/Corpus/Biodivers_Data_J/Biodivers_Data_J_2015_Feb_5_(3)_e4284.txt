Introduction
In the recent checklist of the herpetofauna of Vietnam,  listed 46 skink species of the family Scincidae. Since then five new species have been described from Vietnam, viz. Scincella
apraefrontalis Nguyen, Nguyen, Böhme &amp; Ziegler, 2010 (), Scincella
darevskii Nguyen, Ananjeva, Orlov, Rybaltovsky &amp; Böhme, 2010 (), Tropidophorus
boehmei Nguyen, Nguyen, Schmitz, Orlov &amp; Ziegler, 2010 (), Sphenomorphus
tonkinensis Nguyen, Schmitz, Nguyen, Orlov, Böhme &amp; Ziegler, 2011 (), Sphenomorphus
sheai Nguyen, Nguyen, Van Devender, Bonkowski &amp; Ziegler, 2013 () and two species newly recorded for the country, namely Sphenomorphus
mimicus Taylor, 1962 (), and Sphenomorphus
incognitus (Thompson, 1912) ().

In Son La Province, previous studies documented a total of 11 species of Scincidae (, , ). In Dien Bien Province, , , and  recorded six species of skinks. During recent field work in northwestern Vietnam, a number of skinks was collected from Copia, Sop Cop and Muong Nhe nature reserves. Morphological examination revealed six new records of Scincidae for Son La and Dien Bien provinces that are provided herein.

Materials and methods
Sampling
Field surveys in northwestern Vietnam were conducted by Anh Van Pham, Tan Van Nguyen, Ngoc Thi Bich Nguyen, Men Thi Nguyen, and Hoang Van Tu (hereafter AVP et al.) between June 2013 and May 2014 and by Truong Quang Nguyen, Anh Van Pham, Hai Ngoc Ngo, Tan Van Nguyen, and Hoang Van Tu (hereafter TQN et al.) in September 2014 in the Copia and Sop Cop nature reserves (Son La Province); by Dzung Le Trung, Bach Viet Nguyen, Ngat Thi Bui, Hoa Phuong Vu (hereafter DTL et al.) between May 2012 and August 2014 in Muong Nhe Nature Reserve (Fig. ). Specimens were collected by hand between 9:00–23:00. After taking photographs, specimens were anaesthetized in a closed vessel with a piece of cotton wool containing ethyl acetate, fixed in 80% ethanol and subsequently stored in 70% ethanol. Voucher specimens were subsequently deposited in the collections of the Tay Bac University (TBU), Son La Province and the Hanoi National University of Education (HNUE), Hanoi; and the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (IEBR), Hanoi, Vietnam.

Morphological characters
Measurements were taken with a digital caliper to the nearest 0.1 mm. The following abbreviations are used: SVL: Snout-vent length, TaL: Tail length, AG: Axilla-groin distance (from posterior junction of forelimb and body wall to anterior junction of hind limb and body wall with the limbs held at right angles to the body), HL: Head length (from tip of snout to posterior margin of parietal), HW: Head width (at the widest point of temporal region), SL: Snout length (from anterior corner of eye to tip of snout), SFlL: Snout-forelimb length (from tip of snout to anterior junction of forelimb and body wall, with the limb held at right angles to the body), FlL: Forelimb length (from anterior junction of forelimb and body wall to the tip of fourth finger, with the limb held at right angles to the body), HlL: Hind limb length (anterior junction of hindlimb and body wall to the tip of fourth toe, with the limb held at right angles to the body). Scalation: Paravertebral scales (number of scales in a line from posterior edge of parietals to dorsal point opposite posterior margin of the medial precloacals); ventral scale rows (number of scales from first gular to anterior margin of precloacals).

Head longer than wide; rostral wider than high; supranasals absent; prefrontals separated from each other by frontal; parietals in contact posteriorly; one pair of enlarged nuchal scales; loreals 2; supraoculars 4, followed by two small postsupraoculars; primary temporals 2; secondary temporals 2; lower eyelid scaly; supralabials 7, the fifth and sixth below the eye, separated from it by a row of small scales; external ear present, with three very small lobules, tympanum deeply sunk; mental wider than long; infralabials 7; postmental undivided; midbody scales in 34–36 rows; dorsal scales between lateral stripes in ½ + 8 + ½ rows, smooth, as large as the lateral scales; paravertebral scales 68–74; ventrals in 65–69 transverse rows, smooth; precloacals 2, enlarged; medial subcaudals not widened; limbs short, pentadactyl; fingers and toes meeting when adpressed; subdigital lamellae smooth, 11 under fourth finger and 15–18 under fourth toe.

Coloration in alcohol. Dorsum and tail base bronze brown; upper lateral zone with a dark gray stripe, in width of 3 or 4 scales, from behind eye to tail base; light dorsolateral stripe present on neck and shoulder, the lower margin of dark stripe with some broken light spots; lower lateral zone light gray; ventral white. For coloration in life see Fig. .

Distribution
In Vietnam, this species is a common species known from Lao Cai and Lang Son provinces in the North southwards to Dong Nai Province. Elsewhere, this species has been recorded from India, Bhutan, China, Taiwan, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia (Nguyen et al., 2009). This is the first record of the species in Dien Bien Province.

Ecology
The specimens were collected between 9:00 and 12:00 on the ground. The surrounding habitat was secondary forest of small hardwood, bamboo and shrub.

Discussion
Except for Eutropis
macularius and Sphenomorphus
indicus, the remaining recorded species from Dien Bien and Son La provinces are poorly known in Vietnam due to their rarity or cryptic lifestyle in or under the leaf litter (, , ). Scincella
devorator and Sphenomorphus
cryptotis were recently described from northern Vietnam by  based on a collection from Nghe An and Quang Ninh provinces. Scincella
ochracea and S.
monticola were recorded for the first time from the country by  and by , respectively. Our new findings increase the total number of the family Scincidae species to nine in Dien Bien Province and 14 in Son La Province, comprising five species of Eutropis, one species of Lygosoma, two species of Plestiodon, five species of Scincella, two species of Sphenomorphus, and four species of Tropidophorus (see Table ).
