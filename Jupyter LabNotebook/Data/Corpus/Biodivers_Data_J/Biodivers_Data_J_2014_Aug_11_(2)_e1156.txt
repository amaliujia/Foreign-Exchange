Introduction
Dorylaims, the representatives of the nematode order Dorylaimida, with more than 2500 valid species and more than 250 valid genera (), are one of the most important taxa among Nematoda. Their diversity has been characterized with some success in several temperate (Europe, New Zealand, South Africa and USA) and a few tropical (Costa Rica and India) areas, but it remains poorly explored or nearly totally unknown in many other territories. The study of dorylaimid fauna of southeast Asia, and more particularly of Vietnam, has received little attention as only 25 species belonging to 15 genera were identified in this country until the end of the past decade in a total of 12 contributions (see Table  for a summary of available data). More recent studies by , however, suggest that the Vietnamese dorylaimid fauna is significantly richer.

The information regarding the occurrence of members of the family Belondiridae Thorne, 1939 in Vietnam is especially poor as it is limited to the original description of two species of the genus Dorylaimellus Cobb, 1913, namely Dorylaimellus
vietnamensis Ahmad &amp; Sturhan, 2000 and Dorylaimellus
vietnamicus Gagarin &amp; Nguyen, 2004. This contribution provides new data on three known belondirid genera and species, which are recorded for the first time in the country.

Materials and methods
Nematological surveys were conducted in three locations of Northern Vietnam: Cuc Phuong National Park, Ninh Binh Province, in August 2009; Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park, Quang Binh Province, in July 2010; Huu Lien Nature Reserve, Lang Son Province, in May 2013. Soil samples from each location consisted of 200 g of soil from up to 10 cm depth. Soil samples were kept in plastic bags and brought to laboratory. Nematodes were extracted by a modified Baermann funnel technique, killed by heat, fixed in hot formaldehyde 4%, transferred to anhydrous glycerol according to , and mounted on glass slides for further handling.

Microphotographs were taken with a Nikon Eclipse 80i light microscope provided with differential interference contrast optics (DIC) and a Nikon Digital Sight DS-U1 camera. Specimens were deposited in the collections of the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (IEBR), Vietnam; the Andalusian Research Group on Nematology, University of Jaén, Spain and the Institute for Zoology, Department of Terrestrial Ecology, University of Cologne, Germany.

Description
Specimens examined (n=4): Four females in good condition (Figs , ).

Measurements: See Table .

Female: Slender nematodes of medium size. Habitus very weakly curved ventrad upon fixation. Body cylindrical, tapering towards both ends, but more so towards the anterior one. Cuticle bearing fine transverse striations, about 2.0 µm thick at neck region, 2.0 µm at mid-body, and 8–10 µm at tail. Lateral chords 7–8 µm wide or occupying one-fifth of mid-body diameter. Lip region cap-like, offset from adjacent body by a constriction, twice as wide as high and less than one-fifth (16–18%) of body diameter at neck base; lips separate, their inner portion forming liplets; papillae low, hardly protruding. Amphid fovea cup-shaped, its opening at level of the cephalic constriction and occupying 6 µm or ca three-fourths of lip region diameter. Odontostyle fusiform, as long as lip region diameter, with aperture occupying one-third of its total length. Guiding ring simple but distinct, located at 9 µm or 1.1 times the lip region diameter from the anterior end. Odontophore simple, rod-like. Pharynxbipartite, consisting of a slender muscular anterior section, which bears a minute (but perceptible) mucro at its beginning (observed in the four specimens examined); a deep constriction separating both sections; basal expansion nearly cylindrical, occupying 63–71% of total neck length and surrounded by a distinct spiral muscular sheath. Cardia conoid to cylindroid. Genital system mono-opisthodelphic, with the anterior branch reduced to an uterine sac ca twice the body diameter long whereas the posterior one is well developed: reflexed ovary does not reach the oviduct-uterus junction, oocytes first in two rows and then apparently in a single row; oviduct joining the ovary sub-terminally and consisting of a slender portion with prismatic cells and a moderately developed pars dilatata with distinct lumen; conspicuous sphincter between oviduct and uterus; uterus long, tripartite, consisting of a proximal wider region, narrower and longer intermediate section and a nearly sphaerical distal part; vagina 20–23 µm long, extending inwards ca one-half of body diameter, with pars proximalis surrounded by a very perceptible sphincter, pars refringens totally absent and pars distalis well developed; vulva a transverse slit. Prerectum long, 4.7–5.2 anal body widths long. Rectum shorter, 0.8–0.9 times anal body width. Tail short and rounded.

Male: Not found.

Distribution
Axonchium
thoubalicum  was collected in Cuc Phuong National Park, in soil around roots of Parashorea
chinensis in karst forest.

Taxon discussion
This species is  known to occur onlyin India, from where it was originally described on the basis of three females and one male, and later reported by , who provided measurements of two females and two males. The Vietnamese material herein examined perfectly fits the general morphology of the type material (females) (unfortunately, male was not collected in Vietnam), especially concerning the genital system. Moreover, the morphometrics of the two Indian populations and the Vietnamese one largely overlap in spite of the few number of available specimens in the three cases. The ranges of several ratios and measurements, however, are significantly widened, for instance c = 50–70 vs 53–55 in type material, V = 47–57 vs 52–54, etc. Thus, no reasonable uncertainty persists on the identity of this material.

Notes
This is the first record of this genus and this species in Vietnam, which might display a Oriental biogeographical range.

Description
Specimens examined (n=4): One female and three males in good condition (Fig. ).

Mesurements: See Table .

Adult: Slender to very slender nematodes of small size. Habitus upon fixation nearly straight in female and slightly curved ventrad in males, especially in posterior body region. Body cylindrical, tapering towards both ends, but more so towards the anterior extremity. Cuticle thin, bearing fine transverse striations throughout the body. Lateral chords 4 µm wide, occupying ca one-fifth (20%) of mid-body diameter. Lip region continuous, tapering, somewhat truncate, 1.7 times as wide as high and ca one-fourth (25%) of body diameter at neck base; labial framework weakly sclerotized; lips amalgamated, with low papillae. Amphid fovea difficult to observe in the specimens examined. Odontostyle very short and narrow, but having perceptible lumen and aperture. Guiding ring simple. Pharynx consisting of a slender and weakly muscular anterior region which enlarges rather abruptly, pharyngeal expansion nearly cylindrical, occupying about one-half of total neck length and surrounded by a weak but well distinguishable spiral muscular sheath. Cardia rounded conoid, enveloped by the intestinal wall.

Female: Genital system mono-opisthodelphic. Anterior branch rudimentary, reduced to a uterine sac up to 1.5 times the corresponding body diameter long. Posterior branch well developed, but the detailed composition of its tract indistinguishable in the only one specimen examined. Tail rounded, slightly clavate, with the outer cuticle layer visibly thickened and showing radial striation.

Male: Genital system diorchic, with opposite testes. In addition to the ad-cloacal pair, situated at 5 µm from cloacal aperture, there are two ventromedian supplements, the posteriormost of which is located out of the range of the spicules, at 45 µm from the ad-cloacal pair. Spicules dorylaimoid, slightly curved ventral, 6.3 times as long as wide and 1.2 times as long as anal body diameter. Lateral guiding pieces difficult to observe. Tail short and rounded,  visibly concaveventrally, the outer cuticle layer less expanded than in the female. Caudal pores, if present, obscure.

Distribution
Belondira
murtazai  was collected in Cuc Phuong National Park, in soil around roots of Parashorea
chinensis in karst forest.

Taxon discussion
Above description fits very well the original one of this species by  and the revised one by , the latter based on the study of type material. A few minor differences, however, may be noted in the morphometrics of Indian and Vietnamese populations, but their ranges widely overlap, for instance slightly smaller general size (L = 0.77–0.94 vs 0.85–1.06 mm in type material as described by Siddiqi) and somewhat longer odontostyle (3–5 vs 3–4 µm). A major tentative difference between both populations is the length of the prevulval uterine sac (up to 1.5 vs 2.3–3.0 times the body diameter); nevertheless, the morphometrics given by Siddiqi certainly covers only a few out of the 12 female paratypes as Ferris et al., who examined two female paratypes loaned by Siddiqi, stated (p. 26) that the “anterior uterine branch is 1.7–2.0 body widths long”, and their Fig. 11E shows that this structure is hardly more than 1.5 times the body diameter. Ferris et al. (op. cit.) regarded Belondira
rafiqi Suryawanshi, 1972, also recorded in India, as a junior synonym of Belondira
murtazai, a decision that seems to be well supported and is herein followed.

Notes
This is the first record of this genus and this species in Vietnam, which might display a Oriental biogeographical range.
