Introduction
Lehmann JGC (1818) Botanische Beobachtungen. Coldenia, Colsmannia, Cynoglossum, Omphalodes. Der Gesellschaft Naturforschender Freunde zu Berlin Magazin für die neuesten Entdeckungen in der gesammten Naturkunde, Vol. 8 (1814–1818): 91–100, with 4 Figures (Plates IV–VII) [Apparently in the printed paper the plates referred to as IV to VII in the text were misnumbered I to IV, and the numbering corrected by hand at least in the attached copy and the online version from Göttingen []. For a pdf of the original publication see Suppl. material .

Many contributions on Boraginaceae by German botanists up to the late 20th century were published in discontinued serial publications and have rarely if ever been cited in modern scholarly literature. Unawareness of such previous studies may lead to loss of valuable information and avoidable misunderstandings. A paper by , "What is Cynoglossum
lusitanicum L.", is a particularly good example, as the topic had – with similar results as to the assignment of Cynoglossum
lusitanicum to the genus Omphalodes – already been discussed by Lehmann in 1818, not cited in that article. When discussing this apparently language-related issue with other taxonomists, the suggestion was made to make these older papers available in English. We accordingly are here starting a series of republications of such valuable older literature. To improve readability, we translated the text, which is written in a 200-year-old German, not literally but freely whenever helpful for better clarity, using also . In Lehmann's text we checked and completed his citations [in square brackets], linking them to online resources with the original literature, as available. If necessary, we applied current names based on recent phylogenetic investigations of the mentioned taxa. Plant names in footnotes are cited in conformity with international standards, adapted from IPNI. In the references we added links to the publication corresponding to each, with standard abbreviation, from the online version of  (onward): "Taxonomic Literature II (TL-2): Taxonomic Literature: A selective guide to botanical publications and collections with dates, commentaries and types (Stafleu et al.)" at the  Smithsonian Institution Libraries.

Coldenia


This genus belongs to the Pentandria
Monogynia among the nutlet-bearing Asperifoliae[1], its closest relative being the genus Heliotropium. Linné [: 125] grouped it with his Tetrandria
Tetragynia, and it has been retained in that position by most botanists, even by Willdenow[2] and Persoon[3]. Tracing back to Linné's first editions of his Species Plantarum reveals though that he had not had the opportunity to adequately investigate this plant [Coldenia
procumbens] as he specifically states that “Others may study the fruiting on live plants, I did not see it achieved”.

Gaertner [], in his work “De fructibus et seminibus plantarum Vol. 1. p. 329”, assigns to this genus four stamens and a style[4] with two stigmas. Jussieu [] (Genera Plant. pag. 130) followed Linné’s generic characters but adds the question “does Coldenia rather have five stamens?”, especially because he had received a second species which according to Dombey’s affirmation displayed a calyx as well as a corolla with five incisions and thus needed to be classified with Pentandria
Monogynia. The plant he refers to is identical to the one described by Dr. Persoon [] (Synopsis plant. 1. pag. 157) as Tiquilia
dichotoma – being Lithospermum
dichotomum of the Flora Peruviana [Ruiz &amp; Pavón] Vol. 2 pag. 5. tab. 111 [fig. c].

The habitus of the plants clearly indicates that the genus Tiquilia belongs to Coldenia[5]. The affiliation of Coldenia to the nutlet-bearing Asperifoliae is evident from a comparison with its next of kin Heliotropium, and I would consider Coldenia
procumbens as only an a b n o r m a l species, if I had not personally seen pentamerous and pentandrous flowers on several plants collected in Guinea. Only the lowest flowers mostly lacked the fifth part in calyx and corolla as well as the fifth stamen, but all were monogynous. – In no case did I find 'bilocular nuts' which had also been reported for Coldenia
procumbens, but rather in every case I identified four distinct, basally connate nutlets[6], two of which were sometimes not fully developed.

[1] Boraginales (or Boraginaceae s. l. sensu APG III, ).

[2] No year indicated, but most probably : 712.

[3] No year indicated, but most probably : 1.

[4] Lehmann, to designate the style, used the now obsolete term “Staubweg”, literally “dust way”, i.e., pollen thoroughfare or stylar transmission canal.

[5] ,  again separated Tiquilia from Coldenia. Molecular phylogenetics prove Coldenia to be a member of Cordiaceae () and Tiquilia of Ehretiaceae ().

[6] Lehmann apparently used seed ("Saamen") for the dispersal unit and nut or nutlet ("Nuss", "Nüsse") for the structural/morphological unit.

Colsmannia [Lehm.] (new genus)

Natural character.


CAL[YX]. Perianth monophyllous [synsepalous, fused], five-parted, campanulate, petaloid [showy], very large, persistent, with pentagonal base: lobes ovate-lanceolate, patent, acute at the apex, longer than corolla.

COR[OLLA]. With a single petal [sympetalous, fused], tubular-campanulate, shorter than calyx. Tube cylindrical. Limb tubular-ventricose, five-toothed. Throat bare, open.

STAM[ENS]. Filaments five, somewhat fleshy, inside corolla tube. Anthers subulate-sagittate, united in a pyramidal fascicle, free at base, erect, as long as filaments.

PIST[IL]. Ovules four. Style filiform, longer than corolla. Stigma obtuse.

PER[ICARP][7]. Absent. Calyx swollen, enclosing seeds at the bottom.

SEM[EN – SEED]. Nutlets four, two opposite ovate, triangular, bone-like, shiny, smooth, fixed to the receptacle, perforate at the base, two often aborted.

 


Essential character.



Calyx five-parted, petaloid, very large, pentagonal at base. Corolla cylindrical-campanulate, shorter than calyx. Throat bare. Anthers hastate, free. Nutlets four, triangular, ovate shiny bone-like, perforate.



Obs. 1) 
Similar to Onosma especially as to corolla, but differing in: 1) calyx with pentagonal base, petaloid, longer than corolla, with lobes ovate-lanceolate, patent. 2) Anthers with a free base, in no way connected. 3) Nutlets with a perforate base.



Obs. 2) 
The species that shows these generic characters was collected in the Orient by Tournefort, if I’m not mistaken.


[7] Apparently Lehmann did not recognize that “nutlets” are parts of the fruit.

Colsmannia
flava [Lehm.][8]
Plate IV. [Fig. 1]
Root brown, white inside, woody in the upper part, apparently perennial. Stems several, erect, simple, half-foot and more [&gt;15 cm], like the whole plant very densely covered with yellow, appressed, soft hairs, thus the species name “flava”. Leaves perfectly entire, sericeous, obovate-lanceolate, somewhat obtuse, attenuate at base; the lower ones petiolate, the upper ones sessile, alternate. Inflorescence: terminal raceme. Flowers with pedicels, pendulous before anthesis, eventually erect; the lower ones with lanceolate bracts longer than pedicels. Dry calyx [v.s. = vidi siccum, i.e. = on herbarium material] colored, pale-yellow, sericeous, sometimes four-parted; fourth lobe two times larger than the remaining ones, with bifid apex. Corolla yellow, with subpubescent external face. Style purplish. Seeds are nutlets. Dry material seen.

This genus is distinct in the first place from all other members of the family Boraginaceae or Asperifoliae by its petaloid calyx. As I have already mentioned, it most closely resembles the genus Onosma [: 196], and within it, Onosma
sericeum[9]. The genus Triplaris[10], a tree in the Dioecia
Decandria, has a rather similar calyx, except that, same as the corolla of that plant, it only has three parts.

I have named this genus after my revered friend, Professor Colsmann from Copenhagen; already well known to all botanists by his exemplary description of the plants belonging to Gratiola collected by Dr. König; and even more so by his vast knowledge of all domains of natural sciences and by the rare largesse by which he grants access to his excellent botanical, entomological, and mineralogical collections to anyone desiring to educate himself; a forthcoming that earned him wide-ranging reverence and affection.

[8] Colsmannia is now treated as synonym of Onosma. Colsmannia
flava is actually Onosma
flava (Lehm.) Vatke ex Boiss., Fl. Orient.: 186. 1875 (urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:119655-1), but apparently no DNA phylogeny is available for confirmation.

[9] Onosma
sericea Willd., Sp. Pl. 1: 774. 1798 (urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:119807-1).

[10] Triplaris Loefl. (Polygonaceae).

Cynoglossum - Omphalodes
These two genera markedly differ in habit and especially by the strikingly different aspects of their seed, which in the case of Omphalodes one would hardly call nutlets, were it not in order to include them among the nutlet-bearing Asperifoliae. Initially separated, they later were reunited by most botanists. At first, I would like to make some general remarks concerning various species of the genus Cynoglossum, to then present a monographic review of the Omphalodes species.

Cynoglossum
lateriflorum[11]. Lamarck [] Dict. enc. Vol. 2 pag. 239. no. 10, and Cynoglossum
lineare[12] Ruiz. et Pavon. Fl. Per. Vol. 2. pag. 6 [] are one and the same plant. The later name has therefore to be deleted from the system.

Cynoglossum
angustifolium. Willd. [] Sp. plant. T. 1. P. 2 p. 763[13], Cynoglossum
emarginatum. Lamarck [] Illustr. Vol. 1. p. 400. no. 1799[14] and Cynoglossum
racemosum Schreb. [] in Nov. Act. Nat. Curios. T. II. [in fact: III] [see also Cynoglossum
cristatum Schreb.] Pag. 475[15] also are one and the same plant. Schreber’s (e a r l i e r) description slightly differs only with respect to the nutlets from that of Willdenow. I know with certainty that Lamarck’s plant also belongs here because I saw original specimens during my stay in Paris; and all three are assigned the same synonym of Tournefort ["Cynoglossum
orientale minus, flore campanulato caeruleo”, : 7]. The name given by Schreber seems to have been completely ignored by recent botanists [e.g., ].

Cynoglossum
cristatum. Schreber [] in Nov. Act. Nat. Curios. Vol. III. pag. 476[16] is the very plant that was (l a t e r) described by Lamarck [] 400, no. 1800, and others under the same name. Also in this case, it appears that Schreber's description has been overlooked.

Cynoglossum
echinatum. Thunberg [] Prodr. Fl. Capens. Pag. 34[17], and Myosotis
cynoglossoides Lamarck [] Illust. Vol. 1. pag. 396 no. 1778 again are one and the same plant. Thunberg [] later described this species in detail in the 5th [in fact: 3rd!] part, pag. 43. [in fact: 48!] of the first volume of Schrader’s neuem Journal für die Botanik 1806. Lamarck’s description of the seeds is very accurate; I agree that this plant should be placed in Myosotis[18].

Cynoglossum
hirsutum. Thunb. [: 34] l.c. and Cynoglossum
lanceolatum Forsk. [][19] Descript. p. 41 also do not differ from each other.

Cynoglossum
cheirifolium. Linn. [: 134][20] and Anchusa
lanata. Linn. [: 914][21] are also one and the same plant. Vahl had noted this when studying Linnaeus's herbarium, and Hornemann [] included that note in the Enumerat. Plant. Hort. Bot. Hafn. [in fact: Hortus regius botanicus hafniensis Vol. 1 (1813)] Vol. 1. pag. 177. The plant that Willdenow [] described as Cynoglossum
cheirifolium in his Enumeratio pl. hort. Bot. Berol. Vol. 1 pag. 180 is, according to Hornemann (l. c. [a.a.O. = am angegebenen Ort]), a different species, and the described characteristics seem to support that view. However, the study of specimens from the local [Berlin] botanical garden convinced me that this is not true and I suspect that, only due to a slip of the pen of Willdenow was the calyx said to be larger (or better, longer) than the corolla.

Cynoglossum
fulvum. Rudolphi [] in Schrader’s Journal für die Botanik 2nd vol. 1799[22] 4th Stück [part] pag. 279, Cynoglossum
clandestinum. Desfont. [] Fl. Atlant. T. 1 pag. 159. tab 42, and Cynoglossum
officinale Brot. [] Fl. Lusit. I. pag. 295 are all identical (compare Hoffm. et Link. [] Flore portugaise I. pag. 190). Dr. Persoon [] falsely believes (Synops. plant. I. 159) that Rudolphi’s plant belongs to the Buglossa[23] and is closely related to Anchusa
italica. I would like to parenthetically add that Anchusa
italica Retz. [] Observ. bot. Fasc. I. pag. 12 is not different from Anchusa
paniculata. Ait. [] Hort. Kew. ed. I. [vol. 1] pag. 177 and that Anchusa
officinalis of [][24] Fl. Atlant. I. pag. 157 also belongs to this group.

Cynoglossum
Dioscorides. Villars []. Fl. Delph. [Dauphiné] Vol. 2 pag. 457. is neither a variant of Cynoglossum
officinale as Willdenow [] sp. plant. T. I. P. 2. pag. 760 [Spec. Pl. ed. 4 2(1)] claims nor is it identical with Cynoglossum
montanum[25] or Cynoglossumsylvaticum [: 77] as is commonly believed. I own a specimen that Villars himself communicated to me, which totally differs from Cynoglossum
officinale as well as from Cynoglossum
sylvaticum.

Cynoglossum
laevigatum. Linné [][26].

The famous Pallas [: 486] described this plant under the name Rindera
tetraspis in the first volume of his “Reise” (append. No. 100 [p. 486] tab. 100 [in fact: 101]) but later on, in his Flora Rossica [: 96] listed it as Cynoglossum
Rindera, which the younger Linné [] (Supplement pag. 130)[27] had originally proposed. The latter author must have considered it to be different from the Cynoglossum
laevigatum of his father, because he chose to describe it under a d i f f e r e n t name, in contrast to Willdenow's [] (Spec. plant. T. I, P. 2. p. 763) e r r o n e o u s quote. Now this Cynoglossum
laevigatum has been assigned by Schultes [: 30], along with some other species [of the genus Cynoglossum] to a separate genus newly named Mattia[28]. At a first glance, Cynoglossum
laevigatum along with Cynoglossumlanatum and Cynoglossumumbellatum seem indeed to make up an own genus, considering the differences in flowers and seeds. But if one compares the flowers and seeds of Cynoglossum
glastifolium, Cynoglossumangustifolium, Cynoglossumstamineum, Cynoglossumcristatum, Cynoglossumlateriflorum and some other less known species, which Mr. Schultes [] perhaps did not have the opportunity to compare, the transition to the remaining Cynoglossa is very striking, and I thus believe that these species may not be considered to constitute a genus of their own. If one persists in separating them, they should at least be left under the earlier and more commonly known generic name [Rindera].

Cynoglossum
lusitanicum. Linn. [] Sp. plant. ed. I. p. 293 [in fact: 193].

This name has been applied to no less than five, perhaps even more completely different plants. Linnaeus's Cynoglossum
lusitanicum, as we learn through Link [], according to Smith (the owner of Linnaeus's herbarium) is a Siberian plant (compare Schrader’s Neues Journal für die Botanik 1. Band 1806. 3rd Stück [piece] pag. 183 [in fact: 139][29]) which, as we also know from Link, does not occur in Portugal[30].

Cynoglossum
lusitanicum. Vahl [] Symb. bot. 2. pag. 34.

This plant, which I will describe further down as Omphalodes
amplexicaulis does not grow wild in Portugal either (compare Brot. [] Fl. lusit. Vol. I. pag. 296) and is also apparently extinct in the gardens. The specimen stored in Vahl’s collection is from the Botanical Garden of Madrid, edited by Dr. Bernades in July 1760 and designated with the Tournefortian [: 140] name Omphalodes
lusitanica elatior cynoglossi folio. I do not understand how plants described as

Cynoglossum with leaves clasping the stem, cordate and smooth at the margins. Vahl l. c. [: 34]

could have been put together with the Linnaean [: 193]



Cynoglossum

 with linear-lanceolate, rough leaves.


Cynoglossum
lusitanicum. Brot. [] Fl. lusit, I. pag. 296 is entirely different from the above-mentioned plants, and has been described by Professor Link [in ] as Omphalodes
nitida Flore portugaise I. pag. 192–94, which is gorgeously depicted in tab. 25. Willdenow [] listed this species in his Enumeratio plant. Hort. Berol. Vol. I. pag. 181 under the name Cynoglossum
nitidum.

Cynoglossum
lusitanicum. Lamarck [] Dict. enc. Vol. 2. pag. 239 I do not consider different from Cynoglossum
lusitanicum Brot., or from Omphalodes
nitida Link. Lamarck’s description, more than his diagnosis, is generally appropriate, while not totally correct. What I have seen in the Paris collections as Cynoglossum
lusitanicum was identical with Omphalodes
nitida. Prof. Link considers Lamarck’s plant as a different species (comp. [] Flore portugaise I. pg. 195).

Cynoglossum
lusitanicum. Miller [] Dict. no. 6 is a mere variety of Omphalodes
linifolia.

Finally, the Abbée [sic] Fortis [] in his Osservazioni sopra Cherso ed Osero pag. 68. describes a Cynoglossum
lusitanicum, which is certainly different from all other plants bearing that name. Because his description is short and little known, it may be appropriate to repeat it here: “Plant one foot [30 cm] tall. Root biennial, woody. Leaves ovate-lanceolate, absolutely entire, villous, ciliate towards base. Stems slightly striate, rough. Flowers small, opposite to leaves, pale blue. Seeds small, muricate. Fortis l.c. [locus citatus = place cited before]”.
