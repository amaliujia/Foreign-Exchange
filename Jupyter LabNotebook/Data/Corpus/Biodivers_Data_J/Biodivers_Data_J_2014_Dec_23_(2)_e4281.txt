Introduction
Vigna Savi is a large pantropical genus of the tribe Phaseoleae with 90 species distributed in six subgenera (, , ). Among the subgenera of the genus Vigna only the subgenus Ceratotropis (Piper) Verdc. has its center of species diversity in Asia and it is popularly known as Asian Vigna (). The subgenus Ceratotropis comprises about 22 species in all three sections viz. Aconitifoliae Tomooka &amp; Maxted, Angulares Tomooka &amp; Maxted and Ceratotropis (Piper) Verdc. (, ). However,  have described a new species V.
sahyadriana Aitawade, K.V. Bhat &amp; S.R. Yadav from India recently. Thus, the number of species in the genus Vigna subgenus Ceratotropis is now 23.

During field survey of plants of the family Leguminosae – Papilionoideae in Western Ghats of India, the authors collected an interesting species of Vigna on hill slopes at about 1200 m elevation above mean sea level in Nasik and Satara districts of Maharashtra, India. It interestingly possesses underground cleistogamous flowers on positively geotropic branches. This unusual character of Vigna species encouraged its detailed study, which revealed that it represents an un-described species of the genus Vigna subgenus Ceratotropis. It has been confirmed by the perusal of relevant literature (, , , , , , , , , ,  and ) and experts' opinion on the identity of the species. It is described and illustrated here.

Flowering and fruiting
August–November.

Diagnosis
Vigna
yadavii is morphologically close to Vigna
dalzelliana (Kuntze) Verdc. but differs in its underground obligate cleistogamous flowers on positively geotropic branches, hairy calyx, small corolla, linear style beak and dimorphic seeds.

Etymology
The species is named in honor of Prof. S.R. Yadav, Department of Botany, Shivaji University Kolhapur, India (MS), in recognition of his valuable contribution to taxonomy of flowering plants of Western Ghats of India.

Distribution
India, Maharashtra, Nasik Dist., Kasara-Ghat near Igatpuri and Kalvan, Saptashrungi hills; Satara Dist., Thoseghar.

Ecology
Vigna
yadavii is a twining annual herb, which grows on hill slopes in grasses and herbs at about 1200 m elevation from above sea level in Western Ghats of India. The common associates of the species are Abelmoschus
manihot (L.) Medik., Apluda
mutica L., Carissa
congesta Wt., Crotalaria
pallida Ait., C.
mysorensis Roth., C.
leptostachya Benth., Cymbopogon
martinii (Roxb.) Wats., Elephantopus
scaber L., Eragrostis spp., Flemingia
strobilifera (L.) R.Br. ex Ait., Hemidesmus
indicus (L.) R.Br. ex Shult., Themeda spp. and Urena
lobata L.

Notes
Vigna
yadavii shows morphological similarities with Vigna
dalzelliana (Kuntze) Verdc. but differs from the latter species by the characters given in Table . The presence of underground obligate cleistogamous flowers on positively geotropic branches is most useful distinguishing characteristics of V.
yadavii. In addition to this, dimorphic seeds and differences in hilum, aril, style beak and corolla are also useful distinguishing characteristics of the new species. Vigna
dalzelliana has a unique flattened style beak but that of V.
yadavii is linear. The poorly developed aril of seeds of the cleistogamous flowers is also diagnostic feature of V.
yadavii.

During rainy season (August–November), the species produces chasmogamous flowers on aerial branches and underground obligate cleistogamous flowers on positively geotropic branches. The cleistogamous flowers are much smaller than chasmogamous flowers and white-albino in color. They remain closed. The pods of cleistogamous flowers are colorless, short, curved and 3–5-seeded. There are no structural differences in chasmogamic and cleistogamic flowers except for the smaller size and white albino color of the latter.
