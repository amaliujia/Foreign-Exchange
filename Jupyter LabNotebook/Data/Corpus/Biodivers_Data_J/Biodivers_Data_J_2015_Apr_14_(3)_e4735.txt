Introduction
Between 1870 and 1940, the genus Trigonopselaphus Gemminger and Harold was treated as a dumping ground for species with securiform labial palpomere 3 and metallic coloration. Eventually species were moved out of Trigonopselaphus and into other genera such as Gastrisus Sharp, Nausicotus Sharp, and Torobus Herman (see  for the catalogue and  for the morphogroups in Torobus), but great uncertainty still exists regarding the taxonomic boundaries of these genera. Recently, I have started dealing with the taxa originally placed in Trigonopselaphus: I erected the genus Terataki Chatzimanolis () to deal with several taxa that had been moved to Torobus and I revised the genus Trigonopselaphus (submitted) to establish the limits in that genus.

In this paper, I review the genus Scaponopselaphus Scheerpeltz. Scaponopselaphus was described () based on a single species and single specimen, Trigonopselaphus
mutator Sharp, 1876. Sharp himself contemplated whether or not he should place the species in Trigonopselaphus (sensu ; currently this would be Torobus Herman) or erect a new genus for it, given that he thought that the absence of postcoxal process distinguished it from other species in Trigonopselaphus. Sharp (1876, p. 145) decided to place the species in Trigonopselaphus since "[Trigonopselaphus] has already scarcely any definite meaning”. Here, I reaffirm the generic status of Scaponopselaphus by providing novel morphological characters and I also describe a new species from Colombia.

Materials and methods
Photographs were taken using a Visionary Digital Passport System with a Canon EOS 40D camera and MP-E 65 lens. Images were automontaged using Helicon Focus 6.2.2. SEM photographs were taken using a Neoscope JEOL desktop SEM and processed using the Fluid Mask 3 software. All specimens were examined using an Olympus SZX10 stereomicroscope. Measurements were made using an ocular micrometer. Width: length ratio measurements were made on the widest and longest parts of the structure. The comparison between the length of the median lobe and the paramere excludes the bulbous basal part of the median lobe. Total body length is measured from the anterior margin of frons to the posterior margin of tergite VIII. Terminology and label data follow the procedure established by  and used in other Xanthopygina taxonomic works (e.g., , , , , , ). The type locality of Scaponopselaphus
mutator (Sharp) has been corrected as indicated in .

Diagnosis
Scaponopselaphus can be distinguished from all other genera in Xanthopygina by the combination of the following characters: (1) Head with distinctive microsculpture (Fig. ); (2) labial palpomere 3 (P3) securiform (Fig. ); (3) pronotum with broad and convex lateral margins (Fig. ); (4) mesotarsomere 1 in males with spatulate setae [unknown in other Xanthopygina] (Fig. ); (5) tergites III-V with curved (arch-like) carina (Fig. ); and (6) sternite VII in males with small porose structure (Fig. ). Male specimens in Scaponopselaphus can always be easily identified by the spatulate state on mesotarsomere 1, but some species in Phanolinopsis Scheerpeltz, Styngetus Sharp, Xenopygus Bernhauer may look superficially like Scaponopselaphus. However, these taxa do not have securiform labial P3 and their pronotum is not convex. Perhaps the most confusing scenario can be if someone has unsorted female specimens of Scaponopselaphus, Torobus and Zackfalinus Chatzimanolis; all these taxa have securiform labial P3 and somewhat similar head. However, Scaponopselaphus can be distinguished from these two genera based on the microsculpture of the head and the shape of the pronotum.

Distribution
Known from the state of Pará in Brazil, the department of Vaupés in Colombia, the province of Sucumbios in Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, the departments of Loreto and Madre de Dios in Peru and from Suriname (Fig. ).

Ecology
Specimens of Scaponopselaphus have been collected from wet tropical lowlands, however, further details on their habitat are unkown since almost all taxa have been collected with malaise or flight intercept traps. It is possible that the genus prefers forested habitats near rivers based on recent collecting events.

Eyes large, length of eyes / length of head = 0.58, distance between eyes as wide as 1.44 times length of eye.

Pronotum subquadrate, width: length ratio = 1.13; with scattered large umbilicate punctures, distance between punctures varies but typically equals 0.5-1 times diameter of puncture. Mesoscutellum with medium-sized punctures, punctures not confluent. Elytra with large, almost confluent punctures; each row with approximately 11 punctures (measured at middle of elytron). Abdominal tergites III-V with strongly delineated curved (arch-like) carina.

Secondary sexual structures. Males with posterior border of sternite VII with deep U-shaped emargination; sternite VIII with deep, broad U-shaped emargination medially; sternite IX with deep V-shaped emargination medially. Females with no obvious secondary sexual structures. Aedeagus as in Fig. ; paramere divided to near base into two lobes; lobes narrower and subequal in length to median lobe; in dorsal view each lobe converging to rounded apex; in lateral view paramere slightly convex; with peg setae (sensory spinules) as shown in Fig. , scattered throughout length of two lobes. Median lobe in dorsal view converging to narrow pointed apex; with single narrow dorsal tooth; in lateral view becoming much narrower near apex.

Diagnosis
Scaponopselaphus
diaspartos can be distinguished from S.
mutator based on the following characters: epicranium flatter and distance between eyes longer in S.
diaspartos than in S.
mutator; pronotum punctation more dense in S.
diaspartos than in S.
mutator (Fig. ); and elytra punctation more sparse in S.
diaspartos than in S.
mutator (Fig. ). Additionally, the following characters can be used to distinguish between males of the two species: in S.
diaspartos posterior border of sternite VII with deeper median emargination than in S.
mutator; in S.
diaspartos peg setae are more scattered in the paramere (Fig. ) than the peg setae of S.
mutator (Fig. ); and the median lobe of in S.
diaspartos is as long as the paramere (Fig. ) while the median lobe in S.
mutator is longer than the paramere (Fig. ).

Etymology
The specific epithet is derived from the modern Greek word διάσπαρτος (scattered) and refers to the distribution of the peg setae on the parameres. The epithet is a noun in apposition.

Distribution
Known from Vaupés, Colombia.

Notes
These two specimens look rather similar to S.
mutator, however, I am unable to place them in that species without male specimens from the same locality.

Discussion
In the recently completed molecular phylogeny of Xanthopygina, Scaponopselaphus was shown to be the sister group of Elmas Blackwelder (​). Elmas is a rather distinctive genus of xanthopygine rove beetles with several unique morphological features (see ,  for details) and at first glance, Elmas and Scaponopselaphus do not share many morphological characteristics. While a morphological phylogeny of Xanthopygina is still in preparation and a list of synapomorphies for the two genera is not currently available, there are certain common features worth mentioning here. First of all, the overall bauplan of the head for both genera is similar. Both genera have securiform labial palpus 3, which appears rather similar, and it is unlike the securiform palpus of Zackfalinus or Dysanellus Bernhauer (see  for details on the morphology). Also, the secondary sexual structures on sternites VII-IX have the same kind of medial emarginations, although it is worth pointing out here that Elmas does not have a porose structure on sternite VII as in Scaponopselaphus.

Scaponopselaphus does not appear to be very common in collections around the world. During the last 15 years, I was able to locate the genus only in the four museum collections listed in the Materials and Methods sections as depositories, even though I have visited most major museums in North America and Europe. However, I doubt that the genus is rare in the field and it is more likely that we have not sampled adequately at the correct habitat. Based on recent collecting events, it appears that Scaponopselaphus is easily collected with flight intercept traps in localities near rivers and it is quite likely that many more new species are awaiting discovery in South America.
