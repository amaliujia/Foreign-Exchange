Introduction
The  currently consists of ten accepted Tylorida species distributed in parts of Asia, Australasia and Africa.  established genus Tylorida on the basis of Meta
striata Thorell, 1877. Currently valid as Tylorida
striata (Thorell, 1877), this species has a long and interesting taxonomic and faunistic history. In a series of publications on spiders from Malaysia and Papua New Guinea,  described Meta
striata based on female specimens collected from Kandari (now Kendari), South east Sulawesi, Indonesia mentioning this species is also found on Amboina (now Ambon Islands), Indonesia.  described its male from Sumatra.  reported a male from Bandar Bahive, Sumatra. He noted that it is not easy to identify this species on the basis of previous literature and warned that, difficulty in understanding its femoral setae could lead to its placement in wrong genus.  nicely illustrated the male palp showing the coiled spermatic ducts.

 described Tylorida
magniventer from an unknown location in Japan which was later synonymised with T.
striata by . Tylorida
striata has been reported a number of times from Japan (, , ).  reported the species from Andai, North New Guinea based on a female specimen; ,  reported the species based on a female from South New Guinea;  reported a male from Taiwan;  illustrated female epigynum and male palp using Australian specimens.

 examined male holotype of Sternospina
concretipalpis Schmidt &amp; Krause, 1993 from the Comoros Islands and synonymised with T.
striata, thus extending the species distribution far to the west. They noted conspicuous distributional gap and speculated that it may be due to lack of study, particularly from the Indian subcontinent. A detailed morphological description and phylogenetic position of T.
striata in reference to its genus was provided in the atlas of Tetragnathidae (). However, the whereabouts of Thorell's type(s) of Meta
striata were unknown (, ).

Materials and methods
Syntypes of Meta
striata were loaned from Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria, Genoa, Italy (MSNG) at Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, The Netherlands for examination by Siddharth Kulkarni and imaged using Nikon DS-Ri1 mounted on Leica M165C™ stereozoom microscope, Indonesian material using Zeiss™ Stemi SV11 stereomicroscope and Indian material using Brunel IMXZ™stereozoom microscope and imaged using Canon 1200D™ mounted camera. Indonesian specimens are deposited at Naturalis Biodiversity Center (RMNH), Leiden, The Netherlands and Indian specimens are deposited at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), Mumbai. Map was prepared using . All morphological measurements are in millimetres (mm).

Description
Syntypes (Fig. ) (examined by Siddharth Kulkarni). Two adult females, undissected epigyna, abdomen detached from cephalothorax; abdomen of one female damaged right laterally. Measurements of one syntype. Total length 5.36, carapace 2.03, 1.60 wide, abdomen 2.74 long, 3.14 high.

Carapace brown, sternum and legs fawn; trichobothrial sockets on proximal quarter length of femora IV. Abdomen yellowish brown with shiny guanine patches lined from apex towards ventral side, as also seen in live specimen (Fig. ). Abdomen globose, roughly triangular in lateral view with two small tubercles at apex. Epigynal plate flat, 1.5 times wider than long, coils of fertilization ducts seen translucently (Fig. ).

Dissected epigynum in other material shows, coiled and sclerotized fertilization and copulatory ducts, parallel just before joining spermatheca (Fig. ​).

Remarks
The female length of T.
striata per taxonomic literature and examined specimens ranges between 3.2-5.5 mm (Suppl. material ​).  reported average size of female as 10 mm which is an error (pers. comm. Fernando Álvarez-Padilla).

Synonymy
Original description of T.
stellimicans by ​ mentioned 'excessivement voisine' (extremely close) to T.
striata distinguished T.
stellimicans on the basis of arrangement and size of eyes. This description is of sub-adult T.
striata where eye dimensions vary and ventral side of abdomen including epigynal plate surface is blackish. Also, wide distribution of T.
striata including locality region of T.
stellimicans and apparent absence of records elsewhere of T.
stellimicans; we propose T.
stellimicans as synonym of T.
striata.

Taxon discussion
 stated the location of type material was uncertain and possibly in the Natural History Museum of the city of Geneva based on unpublished notes of Levi. The type(s) of T.
striata are not there and none of Thorell’s types have been deposited in Geneva (pers. comm. Peter Schwendinger, Curator, Natural History Museum, Geneva). There is likely to be confusion between Geneva (Switzerland) and Genoa (Italy) due to similar spellings and pronunciation. Many of Thorell’s types have been deposited at Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Genova (also known as the Natural History Museum of Giacomo Doria, Genoa). The existence of two syntypes collected by O. Beccari in 1874 from Kandari, Indonesia was confirmed (Fig. ) at this museum in Genoa.  mentions collection of three females, but only two were found in the vial labelled as ‘Cotypi’ and one remaining specimen is missing.

Discussion
The new record of T.
striata from the Indian peninsula joins the disjunction of this species’ distribution between Comoros Islands and China to Australia (Fig. ). Interestingly, the species is found on either sides of the Wallace line, thus distributed throughout the two ecozones of Asia (Indo-Malayan &amp; Palearctic) and Australasia. The record from Comoros Islands, which belongs to the Afrotropical ecozone is noteworthy. The wide distribution of T.
striata could be attributed to the dispersal and adaptive capacity of this species. On the other hand, Tylorida
sataraensis Kulkarni, 2014 is restricted to a smaller part of Western Ghats in India (). These distributional variations of species belonging to same genus may suggest contrasting adaptive capacities, since T.
striata undoubtedly sustains in anthropogenically exploited habitats whereas, T.
sataraensis is a habitat specialist, currently under threat of habitat degradation (, ). Two other Tylorida species having T.
striata-like globose abdomen, Tylorida
mornensis (Benoit, 1978) and Tylorida
seriata (Thorell, 1899) are only known from their respective type localities (Fig. ). Tylorida
seriata has not been reported since its original description from Cameroon whereas T.
mornensis was recorded again from its type locality Seychelles and reported as endemic (, ​). Whether this is a natural disjunction, or due to lack of study (​) or a case of synonymy similar to T.
stellimicans needs to be resolved, subject to a future genus revision.
