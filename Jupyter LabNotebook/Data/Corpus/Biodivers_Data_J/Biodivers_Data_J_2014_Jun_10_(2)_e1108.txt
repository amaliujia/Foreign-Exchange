Introduction
Amrum is a small barrier island off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It covers an area of about 20 km2, though considerable areas of saltmarsh vegetation are exposed at low tide. Amrum has been the subject of many botanical surveys and this survey continues that tradition (, , , , ).

Amrum is approximately 10 km long and 3 km wide at its widest point (Fig. ). Its main habitats run in north-south bands along the island. In the west are open sand flats with a sparse fore-dune vegetation, moving eastward there is a complete dune succession ending in conifer plantations. Beyond the plantations is arable farmland and grazing. Along the eastern shore are mainly saltmarshes and mudflats. Other important habitats include freshwater ponds, marshes and ditches, heathland, urban areas and the seawall.

These data were used in a study of change in the islands flora (). They are published in the hope that they will help future studies.

Sampling methods
Study extent
The survey covered all vegetated areas of the island were access was permitted. In fact, this covers most of the island, however, some nesting bird colonies and private gardens are completely inaccessible.

Sampling description
The biodiversity of each 1 km2 varies considerable so there was no set time limit for surveying a particular square. Grid squares were surveyed as intensively as considered necessary to find all but the rarest species. Aerial photographs, maps, previous surveys and local experts were all used to direct surveying to all potentially important habitats. The grid is based upon the spatial reference system EPSG:31467 - DHDN / Gauss-Kruger zone 3 (Fig. ).

Quality control
Some Salix specimens where identified by R.D. Meikle.

Geographic coverage
Description
Amrum is one of the North Frisian Islands, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Its western coast faces the North Sea and the eastern coast faces the Wadden Sea (Fig. ).

Coordinates
54° 36' 22.9602" and 54° 42' 44.1936" Latitude; 8° 17' 26.5308" and 8° 24' 12.6138" Longitude.

Taxonomic coverage
Description
The study covers all vascular plants growing in the wild. Obviously cultivated plants were excluded, though trees planted for forestry were included as these form so much of the island's habitats. Some examples of natural habitats on Amrum are illustrated (Fig. ).

Temporal coverage
Data range: 2008 7 05 – 2008 7 20; 2007 8 17 – 2007 8 31.
