Introduction
Carpenter ants are among the largest and most common ants in the world and are found in all biogeographical regions (, ). Currently 1,058 species, 495 subspecies and 31 fossil species of Camponotus are known worldwide (), with 62 species and subspecies reported from India (). Despite their large size and abundance, carpenter ants are difficult to identify. Although  compiled the Camponotus of India, their taxonomy in India remains problematic and chaotic. Taxonomy of Camponotus in India needs attention as  highlights major changes in the taxa included earlier by .

The significant contributions pertinent to this study include , , , , , ,  and . Here we describe a new Indian species, Camponotus
parabarbatus sp. n., collected in Shivalik range of Northwest Himalaya. An identification key of Camponotus species is provided from the Shivalik hills of Indian Himalaya.

Materials and methods
The specimens were collected by hand in the foothills of Indian Himalaya, the Shivalik range. Specimen examination was conducted with a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereomicroscope. For digital images, an MP evolution digital camera was used on the same microscope using Auto-Montage (Syncroscopy, Division of Synoptics, Ltd.) software. These images were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS5. Holotype and paratypes have been deposited in PUPAC, Punjabi University Patiala Ant Collection, Patiala. One paratype will be deposited at BMNH, Natural History Museum, London, UK and one at California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, USA. Morphological definitions for measurements (accurate to 0.01 mm) include:

TL (Total Length) – HL+ML+PL+GL

;

HL (Head Length) – length of head, excluding mandibles, measured in a straight line from anteriormost point of median clypeal margin to midpoint of occipital margin in full-face view

;

;

EL (Eye Length) – maximum length of eye as measured in oblique view of the head to show full surface of eye

;

;

ML (Mesosoma Length) – diagonal length of mesosoma in lateral view from the point at which pronotum meets cervical shield to posteroventral corner of mesosoma

;

PW (Pronotum Width) – maximum width of pronotum in dorsal view

;

PL (Petiole Length) – In profile, the maximum length of the petiole node, measured in a straight horizontal line from immediately above the dorsal base of the anterior petiolar tubercle to the posterior margin

;

mTbL (midtibia Length) – maximum length of midtibia in lateral view, with tibial base and apex in the same plane of focus, and with tibia at right angle to femur

;

hTbL (hindtibia Length) – maximum length of hindtibia in lateral view, with tibial base and apex in same plane of focus, and with tibia at right angle to femur

;

GL – length of the gaster in lateral view from the anteriormost point of first gastral segment to the posteriormost point of the last segment

Description
Description of worker (Fig. ):

Worker measurements: TL: 5.10–6.85, HL: 1.23–1.98, HW: 0.92–1.70, EL: 0.32–0.41, SL: 1.15–1.39, ML: 1.87–2.38, PW: 0.77–1.15, PL: 0.19–0.23, mTbL: 1.00–1.06, hTbL: 1.36–1.44, GL 1.80-2.28 (n = 11).

Head: Head subtriangular, longer than wide in major worker (HW/HL = 0.86, n = 1), with arched margins laterally, posterior margin shallowly concave (Fig. ), distinctly elongate in minor worker (HW/HL = 0.75–0.77, n = 10), subrectangular with subparallel lateral margins and convex posterior margin; frontal carinae sinuous; clypeus in full-face view with anterior margin projected beyond anterior margin of gena; anterolateral corner of clypeus forming right angle, carinate in major worker, in minor worker clypeus relatively less carinate, with anterior margin only slightly extending beyond anterior margin of gena, anterolateral corner broadly rounded; scape short (SL/HW = 0.68), fails to reach occipital margin in major worker, distinctly elongate in minor worker (SL/HW = 1.18–1.44) surpassing posterior margin by about 0.33 of its length; mandible with six teeth in minor and seven in major with seventh tooth reduced.

Mesosoma: Mesosomal outline in lateral view smoothly arched; propodeal dorsum forming obtuse angle with declivity (Fig. ); propodeum compressed laterally; propodeal spiracle round; tibia tubular.

Petiole: petiolar scale broad, dorsally convex.

Sculpture: Head microreticulate, reticulation coarser on gena; mesosoma finely reticulate, gastral reticulations even feebler, appearing gently transversally striate. Mandible and scape with scattered punctures. Entire body shiny.

Vestiture: Pilosity yellowish; head, mesosoma, and all gaster segments with dense, erect, long setae; gena, entire ventral surface of head and mandible with dense shorter erect and suberect setae; scape with short, subapressed hairs; hindtibia without row of spiny bristles on ventral margin in addition to 3–4 suberect setae at distal end near spurs; body covered with very short, appressed, white pubescence, more distinct on head and gaster.

Color: Body black, regardless of size: antenna and leg reddish brown; trochanters yellow brown.

Description of Gyne (Fig. ):

Gyne measurements: TL: 9.06–9.25, HL: 1.97–2.00, HW: 1.48–1.55, EL: 0.51–0.56, SL: 1.26–1.27, ML: 2.74–2.94, PL: 0.23–0.28, mTbL: 1.12–1.14, hTbL: 1.53–1.54; GL 4.03-4.12 (n = 3).

As in major worker, with modifications expected for caste and the following differences: head more elongate, sides relatively straight, occipital margin convex; mandible, clypeus and gena brownish. Head narrower than in conspecific major workers; mandible 7 toothed; scape barely reaches the posterior margin of head. Reticulate sculpture more pronounced on head; scutum with scattered wide, shallow punctures. Propodeum dorsum forms right angle with declivity.

Etymology
The species epithet parabarbatus is a compound word meaning “similar to barbatus”.

Distribution
This species seems to be rare in the Shivalik range of Northwest Himalaya although collected from both forested and non-forested areas of the region. Most workers were collected from vegetation while gynes and some workers were found under a large stone.

Notes
Camponotus
parabarbatus resembles to the Camponotus
barbatus distributed in Southeast Asia () but can be easily distinguished from the latter. The head of the major worker of Camponotus
parabarbatus is subtriangular with a shallowly concave posterior margin, the eyes well within the lateral cephalic margins, and the scape barely touches the posterior margin of head, while in Camponotus
barbatus majors the head is subrectangular with gently convex posterior margin, eyes almost touching the lateral cephalic margins, scape surpasses the posterior margin of head by about 0.25 of its length. In Camponotus
parabarbatus minor workers, the scape surpasses the posterior margin of head by about 0.33 of its length, whilst in Camponotus
barbatus the scape does so by half its length. Additionally, Camponotus
parabarbatus is uniformly jet-black whereas Camponotus
barbatus is red brown in color.
