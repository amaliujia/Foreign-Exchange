Introduction
The genus Limnatis
 is a well known leech taxon of nasal leeches. Leeches of this genus have been reported to infest nasopharyngeal cavities of large mammals, including red deer () and humans (, , , , ). Although  placed sixteen species under this genus,  grouped only three species in Limnatis: L.
nilotica (), the type species of the genus, L.
bacescui
, and L.
paluda ().

The type locality of L.
nilotica is Egypt, and this species has been reported to occur mainly in Middle Eastern countries (, , , ). The second species, L.
bacescui was only known from its type locality, Romanian Dobruja (). As L.
nilotica, the last species L.
paluda has mainly been identified in Middle Eastern countries, and is sometimes distributed sympatrically with the first species (, , , ). However, Limnatis
paluda was first described from Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and was stated to be a cattle leech there (). Its taxonomic status was revisited by . Although Moore could not examine Ceylonese materials of L.
paluda, many studies followed his classification on this species. Despite its impact as a parasite of humans and other large mammals, there have been very few distributional studies of Kazakhstan nasal leeches of Limnatis. To our knowledge, L.
nilotica was identified from Bilikol Lake, Jambyl Province, southern Kazakhstan by . In addition, this species was recently recorded in Kazakhstan along with neighboring countries, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan (). The second (TD) and last (KN) authors collected Limnatis leeches from Almaty Province, southeastern Kazakhstan, near the border with China. Based on morphological examination and molecular phylogenetic analyses, the taxonomic status of this leech was clarified. In addition, its genetic diversity based on mitochondrial DNA data is briefly discussed.

Materials and methods
Leeches were collected from the Suygaty Valley located at the left bank part of the Ily River Depression, Almaty Province, Kazakhstan (Fig. ). The specimens were preserved in absolute ethanol (EtOH) in the field. For DNA extraction, botryoidal tissue was removed from the posterior part of the body around the caudal sucker of every specimen, and then preserved in absolute EtOH. The remainder of the body was fixed in 10% formalin and preserved in 70% EtOH. Four measurements were taken: body length (BL) from the anterior margin of the oral sucker to the posterior margin of the caudal sucker, maximum body width (BW), caudal sucker length (CL) from the anterior to the posterior margin of the caudal sucker and caudal sucker width (CW) from the right margin to the left margin of the sucker. Examination, dissection of 2 specimens (KUZ Z702 and Z703; see below), and drawing of the specimens were conducted using a stereoscopic microscope with a drawing tube (Leica M125). Specimens used in this study have been deposited in the Zoological Collection of Kyoto University (KUZ).

The numbering convention is based on : body somites are denoted by Roman numerals and the annuli in each somite are given alphanumeric designations.

Sequences of mitochondrial COI as well as 12S, tRNAVal and 16S (12S–16S) were determined for 2 specimens from Almaty Province. The extraction of genomic DNA and DNA sequencing methods followed . Primer sets for the PCR and cycle sequencing (CS) reactions used in this study were as follows: for COI, LCO 1490 (PCR and CS) and HCO 2198 (CS) (), and LCO-in2 (CS) (5’-GCTATTACAATATTACTTACAGATCG-3’) (this study) and HCO-out (PCR and CS) (); for 12S–16S, 12SA-in (PCR and CS) and 12SB-out (PCR and CS) (). The PCR reaction mixtures were heated to 94°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94°C (10 s each), 43°C for COI or 52°C for 12S–16S (20 s), and 72°C (42 s each), and a final extension at 72°C for 6 min. The sequencing mixtures were heated to 96°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 96°C (10 s each), 50°C (5 s each), and 60°C (42 s each). The obtained sequences were edited using DNA BASER (Heracle Biosoft S.R.L.). The DNA sequences listed in Table 1 were newly obtained in this study, and were deposited with the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC).

To determine the phylogenetic position of Kazakhstani Limnatis, 10 previously published sequences were obtained from the INSDC for use in molecular phylogenetic analyses (Table ). One praobdellid species, Limnobdella
mexicana
, which was identified as a sister lineage in previous phylogenetic studies (, ), was used as an outgroup taxon.

Sequences of mitochondrial COI were aligned by eye, as no indels were observed. Mitochondrial 12S–16S sequences were aligned using MAFFT v. 7.213 FFT-NS-2 (). Genetic distances for each marker were calculated by an uncorrected p-distance, and then neighbour-joining trees were constructed with nonparametric bootstrapping () based on 1,000 replicates using MEGA 6 (). All missing positions were eliminated for each sequence pair. Therefore, the tRNAVal and 16S regions were removed from the 12S–16S sequences, when uncorrected p-distances were calculated.

Habitat
During night time, the leeches examined in this study were found crawling in a small pond (Figs , ) fed from an artificial well on a small hill. The hill is situated in the clayey gravelly desert at the foot of the arid low mountains Ulken Boguty at 1270 a.s.l. (Fig. ). Although at one time local inhabitants grazed domesticated animals around the well, at present there are no dwellers in the area.

Genetic data
Neighbour-joining trees generated based on both the COI (Fig. ) and 12S (Fig. ) genes showed that the present Limnatis specimens from Kazakhstan form a monophyletic lineage with a sequence from L.
nilotica collected in Israel (BS = 86% in COI, 98% in 12S). In the neighbour-joining tree based on COI sequences, this monophyletic lineage and one sequence obtained from the Afghan L.
paluda formed a well-recovered clade (BS = 100%). In addition, the neighbour-joining trees revealed that sequences obtained from L.
nilotica collected in Namibia and Croatia do not form a monophyletic group.

The COI uncorrected p-distance between the Kazakhstani L.
paluda and the Israeli L.
nilotica was 0.2% (Table ) based on 12S sequences consisting of 353 bp which showed that the sequences of the former are identical with that of the latter (Table ). The COI uncorrected p-distance between Kazakhstani L.
paluda and that from Afghanistan was 0.5%, and that between the Israeli L.
nilotica and the Afghan L.
paluda was 0.6%. The COI and 12S uncorrected p-distances between the Kazakhstani, Israeli, and Afghan Limnatis sequences and the remaining sequences of L.
nilotica were 7.3–9.7% and 2.8%, respectively. The COI uncorrected p-distance between the Namibian L.
cf.
nilotica and the Croatian L.
cf.
nilotica was 11.9%, and that based on 12S was 3.9%.

Taxon discussion
The present 4 specimens of Limnatis clearly belong to Limnatis
paluda sensu  based on the following characteristics: VI a1 and a2 forming 1 annulus (a1 + a2) on venter; XXIV quadrannulate; sensillae small, undeveloped; each jaw bearing numerous salivary papillae; monostichodont teeth numbering 30–46 on each jaw; and body surface uniform brownish with lateral marginal stripes in orange.  provided incomplete morphological characteristics of L.
paluda, describing its colour as uniform brown without any bands but with reddish lateral margins, and not very numerous teeth. Although  could not examine specimens of L.
paluda from its type locality, he identified Limnatis leeches from Punjab and Baluchistan, which presently belong to Pakistan, as L.
paluda based on their colouration as well as their limited number of teeth on each jaw.

 stated that L.
paluda could be clearly distinguished from Limnatis
nilotica by its limited number (30–47) of teeth on each jaw (the latter species has numerous teeth on each jaw). He also mentioned that the numbers of teeth in L.
paluda and L.
nilotica never overlapped.  also mentioned that the number of teeth in L.
paluda was at most 45, but that of L.
nilotica ranged from 45 to 60. However,  and  noted that L.
nilotica possessed 30–50 teeth on each jaw. Based on the specimens collected in Azerbaijam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,  reported that L.
nilotica bore 38–40 teeth on each jaw. In addition, L.
bacescui possessed 50–54 teeth on each jaw (). Although Limnatis species are well known as nasal leeches, the taxonomic status of each species seems to be far from clarified. Each nominal species of the genus Limnatis including L.
paluda should be revised based on specimens collected from the type locality.

As mentioned above, the taxonomic identities of Limnatis species have not been fully settled. According to the present neighbour-joining trees and p-distance data, however, the Israeli Limnatis leech, of which DNA sequences have been deposited with INSDC, should be assigned to Limnatis
paluda as mentioned in (), because it forms a monophyly with the present Kazakhstani L.
paluda specimens, and the p-distances of the COI and 12S sequences show extremely low genetic divergence (0.2% in COI and no differences in 12S). In addition, it is highly likely that L.
cf.
nilotica of Croatia and Bosnia and L.
cf.
nilotica of Namibia do not belong to the same species, because those specimens are paraphyletic consistently in the present phylogenetic trees, and the former is highly diverged from the latter (11.9% in COI and 3.9% in 12S). These uncorrected p-distance values are greater than those between L.
paluda and the Namibian Limnatis species (7.3–7.4% in COI and 2.8% in 12S) as well as L.
paluda and the Balkan Limnatis specimens (9.2–9.7% in COI and 2.8% in 12S).

It is noteworthy that the specimens of Limnatis
paluda analysed in this study have low genetic divergences (0.2–0.5% in COI and 0% in 12S). The COI uncorrected p-distances between the present Kazakhstani specimens and the Israeli specimen are lower than that between the former and the Afghan specimen (0.5%) and that between the latter and the Afghan L.
paluda (0.6%). The collection locality in Kazakhstan is ca. 4,000 km from Israel, and ca. 2,000 km from Afghanistan. In contrast, Israel is at most ca. 3,500 km from Afghanistan. Because few DNA sequences of L.
paluda are available, it may be difficult to reveal its detailed genetic structure. However, the results of the mitochondrial genetic analyses at least shed light on the discordance between the COI genetic divergence between the Kazakhstani L.
paluda and the Israeli specimen and the geographic distance between the collection localities.  revealed low genetic diversity in the European medicinal leeches, and suggested that medicinal leeches dispersed rapidly and widely via their host animals as these leeches are ectoparasitic species. Because Limnatis species are endoparasitic leeches that attach to the nasopharyngeal cavities of mammals, they likely achieve long-distance dispersal. Except when they parasitise the mammalian nasopharyngeal cavities, Limnatis species generally inhabit a freshwater environment. One of the routes of the Silk Road passed through the Ili River Depression (), near the collection locality of the present specimens. Therefore, Limnatis
paluda have possibly dispersed by means of freshwater places along the trade route as stepping stones, and thus human activities may have influenced the distribution of L.
paluda. In either case, further taxonomic studies of Limnatis species should be performed to clarify their taxonomic positions. In addition, future molecular studies should elucidate the biogeographical history of Limnatis
paluda.
