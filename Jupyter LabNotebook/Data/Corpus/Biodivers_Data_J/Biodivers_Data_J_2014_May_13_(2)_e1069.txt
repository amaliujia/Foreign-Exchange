Introduction
With its wealth of plant diversity, Myanmar (Burma) constitutes a significant component of the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot with elements of the India, the Indochina, and the Sino-Japanese floristic regions (ca, 13,500 vascular plants: ; ). Yet, while neighboring countries’ floristic diversity has been exposed through international projects, such as Flora of China, Flore du Cambodge, du Laos et du Vietnam, and Flora of Thailand, thus far no reliable sources of Myanmar’s flora have been published except a checklist of spermatophytes contributed by . In order to revise the flora of Myanmar, a decade-long continuous inventory has been conducted by Japanese botanists (), which thus far partly contributed a local checklist (Mt. Popa: ) and a taxon-specific checklist (aquatic plants: ).

The aim of floristic research is not only to count the total number of species but also to evaluate the native flora’s evolutionary origins by comparing with related floristic regions. From this aspect, it is useful to obtain as much information as possible, e.g., chromosome data (). This is especially important for floristic surveys for aquatic plants, in which infra- or inter-specific chromosome variation is widely known (). The proportion of species for which the chromosome number is known is less than 1% in some little-collected tropical areas (), probably including the southeast Asian country of Myanmar.

Aquatic plants, which is polyphyletically evolved in fern and fern allies, basal angiosperms, monocots, and eudicots, is known as having numerous chromosomal variation, thus an excellent model for this aim. Here, in addition to the previous contributions of chromosome counts for new or noteworthy aquatic plants from Myanmar (Najas
tenuis: ; Nechamandra
alternifolia: ), we present three more chromosome counts for the aquatic monocots of Myanmar: Limnocharis
flava (Alismataceae), Sagittaria
trifolia (Alismataceae), and Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus (Potamogetonaceae). A brief review of cytological researches in 45 non-hybrid aquatic monocots plus two well-investigated inter-specific Potamogeton hybrids in Myanmar is also given with a broad focus on those distributed in neighboring areas, i.e., the Indian, the Indochina, and the Sino-Japanese floristic regions.

Materials and methods
Chromosome observation
Plant materials of Limnocharis
flava (Alismataceae), Sagittaria
trifolia (Alismataceae), Najas
tenuis (Hydrocharitaceae), Nechamandra
alternifolia (Hydrocharitaceae), and Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus (Potamogetonaceae) were collected in the expeditions to Myanmar (Bago Division and Shan State) in 2008. The collections were rigorously identified based on morphological characters using the original protologues as well as a previous taxonomic treatment by . Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus (Potamogetonaceae) was identified by DNA barcoding method (). The first set of the voucher specimens was retained in Forest Department Office, Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry, Union of Myanmar (RAF); the duplicates are deposited in two Japanese herbaria: Makino Botanical Garden (MBK) and the University of Tokyo (TI).

Root tips collected in the field were pretreated with 0.002 M 8-hydroxyquinoline at 4 °C in 12 h, and fixed with freshly mixed Carnoy’s fixative (3: 1 ethyl alcohol: acetic acid) for at least 30 min, and then preserved at 4 °C in 12 h. For microscopic observation, root tips were soaked in 1 N HCl for 1 h followed by 10 min at 60 °C. After being immersed in tap water, the materials were stained in a drop of 1.5% orcein acetate solution on a slide glass in 5 min., and then squashed. Then somatic chromosome numbers of the three taxa were obtained by light microscopic examination. For each species, at least two cells were used to confirm the numbers.

Distribution for each species follows .

Literature review
Chromosome researches for aquatic monocots of Myanmar were reviewed with a broad focus on Myanmar and related floristic regions, i.e., the Indian, the Indochina, and the Sino-Japanes floristic regions. The focal species include 45 non-hybrid aquatic monocots listed in ,  as well as well-investigated two inter-specific Potamogeton hybrids (). Initial literature search was carried out with  as well as Index to Plant Chromosome Numbers (Missouri Botanical Garden, http://mobot.mobot.org/W3T/Search/ipcn.html), followed by extensive literature review with original references. For some species, mostly cosmopolitan ones, only a few representative literature references are given for each chromosome number. Since a comprehensive cytological review was given for aquatic plants (), including almost all the taxa listed in the present study, our literature review focused on literature published in 1993 or later. Due to incapability of original references, some rare chromosome counts are not included; those references are mostly published in 1970 or earlier, and written not in English. No detailed references are given for Potamogetonaceae and Ruppia because an exhaustive cytological review was published by , .

Analysis
The chromosome counts given for 45 non-hybrid species of aquatic monocots of Myanmar as well as well-investigated two Potamogeton hybrids among them were reviewed with a focus on infra-specific chromosome variation (Table ). The cited literature references also include chromosome counts obtained from related floristic regions, i.e., the Indian, the Indochina, and the Sino-Japanese floristic regions. For widespread species, cytological information from other regions is cited.

Discussion
Of 45 non-hybrid aquatic monocots and two interspecific hybrids among them, more than two thirds have no chromosome variation. Meanwhile, the following nine species have infra-specific chromosome variation, i.e., Acorus
calamus, Cryptocoryne
crispatula, Blyxa
echinosperma, Hydrilla
verticillata, Najas
graminea, Ottelia
alismoides, Vallisneria
spiralis, Monochoria
hastata, and Monochoria
vaginalis (Table ). Among the cytologically variable aquatic monocots are Acorus
calamus, Ottelia
alismoides, Vallisneria
spiralis, and Monochoria
vaginalis, for which unique chromosome counts are obtained from each floristic region. Myanmar is known as including borders among the Indian, the Indochina, and the Sino-Japanese floristic regions (), yet in the aquatic flora, it is unknown which flora is more influenced. Future research with a focus on such species will address this issue.

Potamogeton is known as having numerous inter-specific hybrids, and each parental combination is varied from intra-ploidy crosses to inter-ploidy ones (). The present study revealed Potamogeton
distinctus × Potamogeton
nodosus as another intra-ploidy hybrid of Potamogeton at tetraploid level.
