Introduction
The southern African Mydidae fauna is the most diverse world-wide both in terms of species numbers and generic diversity. The seminal work by  on the southern African mydids based primarily on specimens he collected himself throughout western South Africa, in which he described no fewer than 108 new species (106 of which are still valid) and 12 new genera (11 of which are still valid), provided a comprehensive overview of this unique fauna.  added to the knowledge following the examination of additional material from Namibia (then South-West Africa).

Taxonomic history
At the start of this review, Namadytes Hesse, 1969 is known from five species with an interesting taxonomic history.

 described the genus Namadytes (p. 278) based on two female specimens and representing two distinct species, i.e., Namadytes
vansoni Hesse, 1969: 280 from Seeheim, Namibia and Namadytes
prozeskyi Hesse, 1969: 282 from Arechadamab, Namibia. On page 284, Hesse describes the genus Namamydas Hesse, 1969 based on a single male specimen, identified as Namamydas
maculiventris Hesse, 1969, collected by himself and his colleagues from the South African Museum (now Iziko South African Museum) at Vioolsdrift on the South African bank of the Orange River, which represents the border with Namibia. Hesse comments on the unique arrangement of the male aedeagal prongs being fused medially in this species.

 established the synonymy of Namadytes and Namamydas based on the collection of female and male specimens at the Excelsior farm No. 127, Namibia, of a new species, Namadytes
cimbebasiensis Hesse, 1972. He writes (p. 139), "The discovery of two additional species of Namadytes from South West Africa, described below, and of which one is represented by both sexes, proves without doubt that the male sex of Namadytes (unknown at the time of description) is identical generically with the male described by me as Namamydas. The latter genus thus falls away as a synonym of Namadytes."

 cataloged all five valid Namadytes species.

Goals of this review
As can be seen from the above information, Namadytes and its five species were represented by nine specimens prior to this study. Two species, i.e., Namadytes
prozeskyi and Namadytes
vansoni, were known from females only, while Namadytes
maculiventris and Namadytes
pallidus were known only from males, and Namadytes
cimbebasiensis from both sexes.

This review is based on an additional 61 specimens from numerous natural history collections accumulated over the past 35 years representing all previously known species. Such an increase in specimen number, their geographic occurrence expanding the range of the genus considerably, and substantial morphological variation suggested that a few new species might be represented among the material. However, this not the case and to the contrary the number of valid species is reduced to three by synonymy.

Materials and methods
Morphological terminology and abbreviations for setae follows , , ,  except for the term 'aedeagal epimere', which is used as described by  on page 32. Abdominal tergites are abbreviated in the descriptions with 'T', and sternites are abbreviated with 'S'. The terms prothoracic, mesothoracic, and metathoracic are abbreviated 'pro', 'mes', and 'met', respectively. The term pubescence (adjective 'pubescent') refers to the short, fine microtrichia densely covering certain body parts. Other generalized terms follow the Torre-Bueno Glossary of Entomology . Species descriptions are based on composites of all specimens and not exclusively on the holotype and are compiled from a character matrix of 149 features and 224 character states assembled with Lucid Builder (version 3.5) and eventually exported as natural language descriptions. These species descriptions have been deposited in the DRYAD data depository and can be accessed in XML-format following the SDD (Structure of Descriptive Data) standard. When available, species are fully described in the male sex while females are only described with those features that differ. The structure of terminalia is only described once for the genus except when species differ. Additional species-specific features of the male terminalia should be interpreted from the provided illustrations.

The female genitalia and male terminalia are first excised and macerated in 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) at 55 °C followed by neutralization in acetic acid (CH3COOH) and rinsing in distilled water (H2O). They are temporarily stored in 75% ethanol (C2H5OH) for examination and illustration and eventually sealed in polyethylene vials containing 100% glycerine (C3H8O3) and attached to the specimen's pin. Morphological features were examined using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V12 stereo microscope. Illustrations were observed with a camera lucida, drawn, inked, and scanned. The setation on terminalia is not shown. Wing length is measured from the tegula to the distal tip of the wing. Whole habitus photographs of pinned specimens were taken using a Visionary Digital Passport II system (base and StackShot only), an Olympus E-30 digital SLR, a 50 mm macro lens (equivalent to 100 mm focal length in 35 mm photography), and a 25 mm extension tube. The specimens were illuminated by a Falcon FLDM-i200 LED dome-light for even and soft light. Adobe DNG-format images were stacked using HeliconFocus software. Photographs of particular features were taken on a Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V12 stereo microscope and an attached Olympus PEN E-PL5 digital camera. All specimen photographs have been deposited in Morphbank:: Biological Imaging. These images can be automatically harvested by the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and are available under the respective species page.

The following data on species occurrences are given (where available): country, state/province, county, locality, geographic co-ordinates (formatted in both decimal and degrees minutes seconds latitude/longitude), elevation (in meters), date of collection (format: yyyy-mm-dd), habitat information, sampling protocol (if other than hand netting), collector, catalog number (a unique specimen number and any other identifying number), depository (institution and collection code), number of specimens and sex, life stage, name of person who identified the specimen, and any other previous identifications (note that for synonymized species the holotype still retains its status as a primary type specimen and therefore the particular material examined list will include two (or more) holotypes; see the entry under 'previousIdentifications' for the original identification by the author). Each specimen is listed with a unique specimen number (either an institutional catalog number or an AAM-XXXXXX number used by the senior author) that will allow the re-investigation as well as provide a unique Life Science Identifier (LSID). The occurrence of all species is illustrated in distribution maps plotted with SimpleMappr () with all of those localities for which co-ordinates are available. Type localities are plotted with a square symbol while all other specimens are plotted with a circular symbol. The distribution map includes Biodiversity Hotspots sensu Conservation International and the electronic shape-files were obtained from: . The specimen occurrence data are deposited as a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A) in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The dichotomous, interactive key has been build with Lucid Phoenix and the multi-access, matrix-based key with Lucid Builder and both have been deposited in the IdentifyLife archive, registered in Lucidcentral, and made available on the senior author's research web-site. All taxon names have been registered in ZooBank ().

Namadytes
vansoni
 Hesse, 1969 – : 278. ; : 331. catalog

Description
Female genitalia (Fig. ): densely arranged anteriorly directed setae present on T7–8 and S7–8; T8 with broad anterior rectangular apodeme; T9 formed by wide, rectangular sclerite with median protuberance; T9+10 entirely fused, T10 divided into 2 heavily sclerotized acanthophorite plates, 8–10 acanthophorite spines per plate; 2 spermathecae, all equally large, formed by ± expanded heavily sclerotized ducts; individual spermathecal duct short; S9 (furca) formed by 1 sclerite, ring–like (joined anteriorly and posteriorly), anterior furcal apodeme present, 2 lateral projections forming divided apodeme, lateral furcal apodeme present, median furcal bridge absent.

Male terminalia (e.g., Fig. ) T1–7 well-developed, entirely sclerotized, T8 postero-medially weakly sclerotized, with anterior transverse sclerotized bridge connecting lateral sclerites; T7–8 anteriorly with 2 lateral apodemes; S6 regular, without any special setation postero-medially, S8 simple plate, entire (undivided) ventro-medially, not fused to T8 dorso-laterally; epandrium formed by single sclerite (fused medially ± entirely), distally in dorsal view blunt, evenly rounded; subepandrial sclerite without lateral or median protuberances; hypandrium strongly concave, cup-shaped, entirely sclerotized ventrally (forming a single sclerite), entirely fused with gonocoxite, forming a gonocoxite-hypandrial complex, supra-hypandrial sclerite absent; gonocoxite dorso-ventrally flattened in distal ½, higher in proximal ½, without median or lateral protuberance, gonocoxal apodeme absent; 2 functional aedeagal prongs, short and wide, medio-distally connected; aedeagal epimere absent; lateral ejaculatory process present, large cylindrical sclerite; ejaculatory apodeme formed by single dorso-ventrally oriented plate; ventro-median margin of dorsal aedeagal sheath heavily sclerotized (appearing entirely closed); dorsal aedeagal sheath long, sperm sac entirely covered; sperm sac appearing ± heavily sclerotized.

Diagnosis
The genus (Fig. ) is distinguished from other Syllegomydinae by the structures of the male genitalia (aedeagal prongs fused medially), the presence of a V-shaped indentation on the dorso-median antepronotum, and the presence of a tuft of setae on the infra-halter sclerite (ventral to halter base and posterior to metathoracic spiracle), with the exception of females of one species. Furthermore, flies are relatively small with a wing length of 6.6–14.2 mm and the males exhibit a yellow to light brown abdomen, which is unusual for southern African Mydidae.

Distribution
Namadytes is distributed in southern Africa and restricted to Namibia and north-westernmost South Africa (Fig. ).

Taxon discussion
Males are unique in the arrangement of their medially fused aedeagal prongs and the yellow to light brown abdominal coloration. Females in contrast are more generalized and similar to other female Mydidae occurring in southern Africa. However, the antero-median V-shaped indentation on the antepronotum and the presence of white setae on the infra-halter sclerite are relatively easy to observe and distinguish the females from other Mydidae. There is considerable sexual dimorphism and the setation, for example on the anatergites, is always easier to observe in males. Intra-specific variation in the abdominal coloration, especially in females, is likewise substantial, which probably led Hesse to describe a species twice.

Diagnosis
This rather small species (wing length in males 6.6–8.1 mm and in females 9.6–12.7 mm) is distinguished from congeners by the entirely grey pubescent vertex, the short postpedicel (only about 4 times as long as combined length of scape and pedicel), the grey pubescent scutellum, and the few white setae on the infra-halter sclerite, which are absent in some females.

Distribution
Namibia (Hardap, Karas) and South Africa (Northern Cape) (Fig. ).

Biology
Habitat
Namadytes
cimbebasiensis has recently been collected on dune scrub and in Acacia savanna in the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park of the Kalahari Desert by J.G.H. Londt.

Discussion
Namadytes
cimbebasiensis is very distinct and the smallest species of Namadytes. All specimens, originating from only five collecting events, are either greasy or are not in the best condition so that in particular the pubescence patterns might differ in freshly mounted material.

Type locality
Namibia: Hardab: Excelsior No. 127 (25°24'00''S, 016°12'00''E) (Fig. ).

Biodiversity hotspot
Not known to occur in any of the southern African biodiversity hotspots (Cape Floristic Region, Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany, or Succulent Karoo) (Fig. ).

♂ terminalia: Fig. , , .

Female: unknown.

Diagnosis
This large species (wing length in males 9.6–12.2 mm, females unknown) is distinguished from congeners by the entirely white pubescent vertex and postgena, by the long postpedicel (about 7 times as long as combined length of scape and pedicel), the long white scutal setation, the yellow postpronotal lobes, the densely grey pubescent mesopostnotum, anatergite, and katatergite, the yellow to light brown coloration of the legs, and the long, erect white setae dorsally on the metathoracic femur.

Distribution
Namibia (Karas) and South Africa (Northern Cape) (Fig. ).

Discussion
 (p. 148) alludes to the morphological similarity of Namadytes
maculiventris and Namadytes
pallidus. We regard the differences between the male holotype of Namadytes
maculiventris and the male holotype and paratype of Namadytes
pallidus as intraspecific variation. So far, only 4 specimens of this species, all males, have been collected in southern Namibia and Vioolsdrift in South Africa.

Type locality
South Africa: Northern Cape: Vioolsdrift (28°46'10''S, 17°37'37''E) (Fig. ).

Biodiversity hotspot
Not known to occur in any of the southern African biodiversity hotspots (Cape Floristic Region, Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany, or Succulent Karoo) (Fig. ).

Diagnosis
This large species (wing length in males 7.1–8.9 mm and in females 10.9–14.2 mm) is distinguished from congeners by the wing venation in that cell r5 is open and therefore M1 terminates in C (and not in R1), the predominantly apubescent vertex, the short proboscis that is only about half the length of the oral cavity, the long white setose anatergite, and the setose katepimeron.

Distribution
Namibia (Erongo, Karas, Kunene) (Fig. ).

Biology
Flight behavior
Females of this species (as Namadytes
prozeskyi syn. nov.) were observed by  to have a hop-like flight in contrast to the low-flying males, which show the characteristic rapid gliding flight behavior in order to locate females for mating. A similar observation has recently been made for Namibimydas
psamminos Dikow, 2012 (, p. 92).

Oviposition
Females usually oviposited in shallow depressions, such as hoof prints and in particular on the lip of these prints, in the sandy Kuiseb river bed and followed a Mydidae-characteristic oviposition sequence of sand-ovipositing species (for details see , p. 149). The insertion of the abdomen into the sand took about 9 seconds while the egg-laying with buried abdomen lasted for 6 seconds. The eggs were orange, hyaline, and pear-shaped and measured 2 x 1 mm (length x maximum width).

Habitat
Namadytes
vansoni has been collected in riparian vegetation along a dry river bed, in thornveld in a dry river bed, and on barren gravel plains.

Discussion
This species exhibits substantial intra-specific variation (Figs , ) and is the most variable species. However, it is also the species known from the most specimens (61 specimens in total) and has the largest geographic range. Prior to this study, Namadytes
vansoni is only known from the sole female holotype (Fig. , ). Only through female and male specimens collected during a single collecting event is it possible to associate both sexes and hence appreciate the pronounced sexual dimorphism (Figs , , ).  hints in the description of Namadytes
prozeskyi, which is also only known from a single female holotype, at the similarity to Namadytes
vansoni and while he provides quite a few minor differences, we attribute these to intra-specific variation. With the increased number of specimens available in our study, we cannot differentiate the two species and therefore synonymize Namadytes
prozeskyi (described on page 282) with Namadytes
vansoni (described on page 280) by page priority.

Type locality
Namibia: Karas: Seeheim (26°48'53''S, 017°47'57''E) (Fig. ).

Biodiversity hotspot
Not known to occur in any of the southern African biodiversity hotspots (Cape Floristic Region, Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany, or Succulent Karoo) (Fig. ).

Identification Keys
Key to Namadytes species
1	Anatergite setose; cell r5 open (M1+2 terminating into C); proboscis about ½ length of oral cavity; katepimeron setose	

Namadytes
vansoni

	
–	Anatergite asetose; cell r5 closed (M1+2 terminating into R1); proboscis short, less than ½ length of oral cavity; katepimeron asetose	

	
2	Infra-halter sclerite (ventral to halter base and posterior to metathoracic spiracle) with only very few white setae (Fig. ); metathoracic femur with only short, appressed yellowish setae dorsally; postpedicel only about 4 times as long as scape and pedicel combined; mystacal setae white or yellow and only sparsely covering facial gibbosity; smaller flies: male wing length = 6.6–8.1 mm, female wing length = 10.6-11.9 mm	

Namadytes
cimbebasiensis

	
–	Infra-halter sclerite long white setose (Fig. ); metathoracic femur with long, erect white setae dorsally; postpedicel about 7 times as long as scape and pedicel combined; mystacal setae white and densely covering facial gibbosity; larger flies: male wing length = 9.6–12.2 mm, females unknown	

Namadytes
maculiventris

	
There is considerable sexual dimorphism and the setation, for example on the anatergites, is always easier to observe in males. Intraspecific variation in the abdominal coloration, especially in females, is likewise substantial.

Discussion
Morphological characteristics
Namadytes species exhibit two remarkable morphological characteristics unknown in any other Mydidae genus.

The antepronotum is anteriorly not entire as in all Mydidae, but has a V-shaped indentation medially that is easily visible (Fig. ).

A small sclerite ventral to the halter and posterior to the metathoracic spiracle, here termed the infra-halter sclerite (Fig. , ), is unique within Mydidae. This sclerite is usually long, densely white setose, but only sparsely white setose Namadytes
cimbebasiensis males and sometimes even asetose in females of this species.

Biology
The knowlegde of the biology of Namadytes is very scarce as there is hardly any information on habitat preferences or flight behavior available on collecting labels. However,  provided some information on Namadytes
vansoni (as Namadytes
prozeskyi syn. nov.) based on his year-long study of Mydidae at the Gobabeb Research and Training Centre in the central Namib Desert, which is summarized under the biology section of that species.

Although not directly observed by Wharton, he suggests that mating with teneral or very young females might occur in Namadytes as well and is an important adaptation for short-lived species in desert environments (, p. 149).

Seasonal incidence
Namadytes has primarily been collected during February through June, during the Southern Hemisphere late summer to early winter, as well as in October (Southern Hemisphere spring) (Table ). Namadytes
cimbebasiensis, ranging from north-western South Africa to south-western Namibia (Fig. ) occurs during March–May, while Namadytes
maculiventris, the species with the smallest geographic range restricted to southern Namibia (the type locality is on the South African bank of the Orange River, Fig. ), occurs in February–March and October, and Namadytes
vansoni, the most abundantly collected species distributed throughout much of Namibia (Fig. ), occurs in February–June and October. It is interesting to note that the October records represent the collecting events of the holotypes of Namadytes
pallidus (junior synonym of Namadytes
maculiventris) and Namadytes
prozeskyi (junior synonym of Namadytes
vansoni).

 studied the Mydidae fauna at the Gobabeb Research and Training Centre, which is located in the center of the species' north-south range in the central Namib desert (23°33'37''S 015°02'26''E), for an entire year and collected Namadytes
vansoni (identified as Namadytes
prozeskyi) between April through June (Southern Hemisphere fall to early winter). The southernmost occurrence record of Namadytes
vansoni is from Rotegab farm No. 95 (27°20'00''S 018°25'00''E) collected in April, which is only some 85 km (straight line) south-east of the type locality Seeheim (26°48'53''S 017°47'57''E) where the holotype was collected in October. The northernmost occurrence records around Khorixas in southern Kunene Region are all from May (Southern Hemisphere late fall).

Namadytes has not been sampled during the hottest months of the year, i.e., December–January, but has been collected in the cooler spring and late summer to early winter months. However, when one takes a closer look at the temperature and rainfall patterns at specific localities, taken from World Weather Online (), a different picture emerges (see Table  for details). At Gobabeb, the hottest months are March–April (Suppl. material ) and the wettest are February–April and June (Suppl. material ) coinciding with the occurrence of Namadytes
vansoni. Further north at the northernmost distribution of this species around Khorixas, where it occurs in May, the average temperature is higher in May than in any other month between February–August (Suppl. materials , ). At the type locality of Namadytes
vansoni (Seeheim near Keetmanshoop), the holotype was collected during May, which is one of the coolest months during the year (Suppl. materials , ). Namadytes
maculiventris occurs at Aus and Vioolsdrift during the hotter months of the year (February–March, Suppl. materials , , , ) and during one of the median temperature months (October) near Keetmanshoop. Namadytes
cimbebasiensis occurs in March–April during a time of high temperature (see Suppl. materials ,  for nearest available weather station in Upington) and during a cooler month (May) at its type locality near Maltahöhe (Suppl. materials , ). Despite not occurring during the peak of the summer, locally Namadytes does occur during the hottest months as well as cooler time sod the year.

These data provide a glimpse at the temperature tolerance within species as, for example, Namadytes
maculiventris occurs at Vioolsdrift with an average high temperature of 19 °C (March) and near Keetmanshoop with an average high temperature of 32 °C (October).

Biodiversity hotspots
The biodiversity hotspots
sensu Conservation International () are areas of high plant endemism in which the habitat has been destroyed to a considerable extant and which are under threat of more destruction. Evaluating the presence/absence of Diptera species in these priority areas earmarked for conservation can determine whether these species will also be preserved when funding is made available for their protection (e.g., ). In a number of recent taxonomic revisions on Mydidae (, ), it was discovered that several species within the studied genera are endemic to a particular hotspot, occur within a hotspot (but are not endemic to it), or occur only outside of these hotspots. Of the three species dealt with in this contribution, none occur or are endemic to any biodiversity hotspot sensu Conservation International (see Fig. ). Therefore, species of Namadytes would not benefit when only the biodiversity hotspots will receive funding for conservation and future habitat destruction and lack of conservation initiatives might have an effect on local populations.
