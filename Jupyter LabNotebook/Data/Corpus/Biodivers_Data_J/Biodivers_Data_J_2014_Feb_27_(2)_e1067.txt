Introduction
The parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera) have been considered as a keystone group that has a disproportionately large role in maintaining the diversity of other animals and plants (). This is mainly a result of the profound and often highly specialized interactions between them and other organisms (particularly plants and other insects), as well as their inherent contribution to biodiversity by being a large and ramified group (). In spite of its importance, parasitoid wasps have rarely been considered in conservation biology efforts. For example, there are no parasitoid wasps among the 302 species of Hymenoptera included in The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (http://www.iucnredlist.org/). Very few countries have provided information or strategies to be used in species conservation of parasitoid wasps (e.g. , , ).

The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC, http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/) exists to provide advice regarding the status of wildlife species that are nationally at risk of extinction or extirpation. Its committee of experts assesses and designates which wildlife species are in some danger of disappearing from the national territory. As part of its work, COSEWIC produces a Species Candidate Lists based on Prioritization Criteria (http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct3/index_e.cfm#p1). There has never been a species of braconid parasitoid wasp being considered by COSEWIC, mostly because lack of available information about any potential species to be considered.

This paper is an effort to provide new and/or updated information about species of Microgastrinae wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) with potential to be considered by COSEWIC to be included in future Species Candidate Lists. Microgastrinae is one of the most diverse and important groups of parasitoids wasps (, , ).

Materials and methods
This paper is mostly based on the study of specimens from the Canadian National Collection of Insects 

(CNC). In a few cases, examination of photographs and distribution records of specimens deposited in the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario 

(BIO) was done by accessing public data available in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (http://www.boldsystems.org/).

Out of the 28 genera of Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) present in Canada (), 13 genera (representing almost 80 species) were examined for species of potential interest in conservation efforts. A total of 16 species were identified as meeting the Prioritization Criteria by COSEWIC (see below for criteria used), and were selected for this paper. Other genera, where more taxonomic work is needed (e.g., Cotesia, Dolichogenidea, Microplitis, Pholetesor) will be evaluated in future works. There are 194 described species of Microgastrinae in Canada (, ).

For every selected species, a brief summary of its broad geographical distribution is provided, with detailed and in many cases new information of its distribution and collecting dates in Canada, hosts (Lepidoptera) if known, and color pictures of the wasp species. A preliminary assessment is then made using the prioritization criteria developed by COSEWIC (http://www.cosewic.gc.ca/eng/sct0/appdx_e1_2_e.cfm): Proportion of the species global range in Canada, Details on existing global conservation status, Canadian population size and trends, Threats, Small extent of occurrence or area of occupancy are also discussed. That information is provided to comply with COSEWIC standards when considering potential candidate species. Meeting the COSEWIC criteria allows a species to be evaluated and eventually incorporated to the COSEWIC Species Candidate Lists – and once in those lists, the species can be studied further and considered for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, if applicable.

Most of the photos were taken with a Keyence VHX-1000 Digital Microscope, using a lens with a range of 13–130 ×. Some of the species were photographed with a Canon EOS 60D with MPE-65 lenses (aperture: 4.0, ISO: 100, CR2 format images), and a 600EX-RT Speedlight (manual) flash; the camera was mounted on a Kaiser copy stand with a Z-stepper (Stackshot) to allow for taking of multiple images. Multiple images through the focal plane were taken of a structure and these were combined to produce a single in-focus image. For the pictures taken with the Canon camera, the Zerene Stacker program (http://zerenesystems.com/cms/stacker) was used; the software associated with the Keyence System produced the focused images taken with that camera.

Maps with the distribution in Canada of all species were generated using SimpleMappr (http://www.simplemappr.net/).

This genus is distributed from the Neotropics (Costa Rica, Mexico) to central and eastern United States ().  mentioned Alphomelon
winniewertzae from Canada (Ontario, Marmora, one female specimen deposited in the CNC), and  recorded the species as also present in the province of Quebec, without giving more details. Here complete information of that second record is provided for the first time (Quebec, Old Chelsea, Gatineau Park, Summit of King Mountain, one female specimen deposited in the CNC). The species has been reported by  as a parasitoid of Calpodes
ethlius and Euphyes
vestris (Lepidoptera: Hesperidae). Based on the information available, Alphomelon
winniewertzae could be distributed in Canada in an area between the rivers Ottawa and Saint Lawrence (44–45°N, 77–78°W). That represents less than 5% of the global range of the species. Alphomelon is mostly a Neotropical genus, with only three species reaching the Nearctic (mostly southern and eastern US), and Alphomelon
winniewertzae is the only known in Canada and the northenmost species of the genus.

The distribution of this species was originally reported from southern Canada (Rondeau Provincial Park) to the Florida keys in the United States (). Subsequent work has expanded the known range towards tropical areas such as Mexico () and Costa Rica (). Canada remains as the northern limit, representing less than 5% of the global range of the species. Until now only a single female specimen, collected in 1973 in Rondeau Provincial Park, was known from Canada (); here additional specimens are reported from two new localities (Ontario, Point Pelee National Park and Brockville, specimens deposited in BIO). The new records, all from 2012, confirm the current presence of Apanteles
samarshalli in Canada, significantly expand the distribution of the species in southern Ontario, and slightly expand its northern range up to 45°N. Nothing is known about the hosts caterpillars parasitized by Apanteles
samarshalli, but most of the specimens have been collected in hammock forests, and most of the known localities share in common the presence of oaks trees (genus Quercus) or cedar (Juniperus, Cupressus).

Threats: Residential and commercial development – medium to high (the areas where the species occur are already heavily populated); Agriculture and aquaculture – unknown; Human intrusions and disturbance – medium; Natural system modifications – high (alteration of the areas would likely extirpate the species from Canada); Invasive and other problematic species and genes – unknown but likely low, unless another wasp species parasitizing the same host would be introduced (and then competing for the same host, an scenario not likely to occur); Climate change and severe weather – unknown. Small extent of occurrence or area of occupancy: Recorded from a few localities in Canada. Limiting biological factors: Host distribution (limited to southeastern Canada) may affect the distribution of the wasp in the country.

Distribution

This species was described by  and considered to be widely distributed in the Nearctic. However, a recent revision of the species combining molecular, biological and geographical data () found that the species is restricted to western North America. The specimens from eastern Canada mentioned in  actually represent Venanus
heberti (see above for details on that species). Here complete details on the localities where Canadian specimens of Venanus
pinicola were collected are reported for the first time (Alberta, Banff National Park, Mount Eisenhower, Johnston Canyon; British Columbia, Langford, Robson, Hixon, Victoria; Yukon Territory, Pelly Crossing; all specimens deposited in the CNC). Venanus
pinicola has been reported by  as a parasitoid of Coleotechnites
milleri and Coleotechnites
starki (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae).

Existing global conservation status: None (species is not listed on Natureserve nor has it been assigned a Canadian national conservation status rank). Canadian population size and trends: No information on population size is available, although the species has been repeatedly collected over a span of 50 years, between July and August. Threats: Residential and commercial development – medium to high (some of the areas where the species occur in Canada are already heavily populated); Agriculture and aquaculture – unknown; Human intrusions and disturbance – medium; Natural system modifications – high (alteration of the natural areas currently protected would likely extirpate the species from Canada); Invasive and other problematic species and genes – unknown but likely low, unless another wasp species parasitizing the same host would be introduced (and then competing for the same host, an scenario not likely to occur); Climate change and severe weather – unknown but likely low (climate change increasing the temperatures would not affect much the presence of this species in Canada, because it is already distributed in warmer areas).

Discussion
This paper is the first to consider braconid parasitoid wasps in conservations efforts in Canada. Out of the 28 genera of the subfamily Microgastrinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) present in the country, 13 genera and close to 80 species were studied, and 16 species were identified as potential candidates to be included in the Species Candidate Lists of COSEWIC. As such it is just a preliminary effort, to be expanded with more studies in the near future. Based on the analyses made, some recommendations and comments are provided below.

Because of the relationship that any microgastrine wasp has with its lepidopteran host(s), it will be important to link future conservation efforts with studies done within Lepidoptera. This is an opportunity to work together on the biological and ecological sides of both host and parasitoid species. For example, search for parasitoid wasps can be conducted by rearing caterpillars (e.g. ).

Several of the species of microgastrine wasps dealt with in this paper are found in protected areas. Having those species added to COSEWIC lists will also increase the profile of those particular protected areas.

A significant number of the species were collected in or nearby Ottawa. This is a collecting artifact (due to the continue presence of entomologists in the Canadian capital for more than 150 years), but it actually provides an opportunity to explore further the population dynamics of some of those species. Two ideal candidates would be Lathrapanteles
heleios and Pseudapanteles
gouleti.

At least one species (Microgaster
deductor) might be linked to climate change (), although the current information is not enough to conclude on this matter.

Two of the species mentioned in this paper (Distatrix
carolinae and Exix
columbica) are only known from one specimen, in both cases collected 50–60 years ago. Both might be rare species, or be already extinct, but more collecting effort in the type localities will be needed.
