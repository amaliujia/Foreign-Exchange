Introduction
The Chalcidoidea fauna of India has not been systematically surveyed covering the whole country and its biodiversity hotspots like Western ghats, Eastern Himalayas and the northeastern region have been badly neglected. Though extensive faunistic studies have been carried out on encyrtids (), mymarids (, ) and aphelinids () in India, several descriptions are based on single specimens without taking into consideration geographical variation and not adequately illustrated. Hosts are not known for most of the known species as collections are made using passive methods like Malaise traps and yellow pan traps. We have been attempting to document the Indian species of Encyrtidae and Mymaridae with good images to facilitate their easy identification along with their hosts. We report here additions to the fauna of Indian Encyrtidae and Mymaridae and new hosts and distribution data for some species.

Materials and methods
Extensive surveys were carried out in Ri-Bhoi, Jaintia hills, East Khasi hills, and West Khasi hills districts of Meghalaya and surrounding areas and in southern India for collection of Chalcidoidea. Different collecting methods (host rearing, net sweep, yellow pan trap and Malaise trap) were used for collection from different ecosystems. Collected parasitoids were processed and curated as per standard protocol () and identified using appropriate keys. Voucher specimens are deposited in the collections of the ICAR-National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (ICAR-NBAIR), Bangalore, Karnataka, India. All measurements were done using the measurement module of Leica M205A stereo microscope and are relative. Imaging was done using Leica M205A stereo microscope and composite images were obtained from image stacks using Combine ZP. The images were touched up for clarity using Adobe Photoshop Elements 11.

Head hypognathous, in front view about as long as broad (Fig. ). Fore wing (Fig. ) infuscate.

The specimens examined by us agree with the illustrations provided by  (see Figs. 1588-1591) except for the presence of the scutellar spot and the setal bunch on scutellum (lost in the holotype illustrated by Hayat). The original description indicates that C.
ajmerensis is dorsally dark brown, but apparently its colour is quite variable.

Male (Fig. ) with head yellow with a median infuscate patch; antenna brownish with elongate whorls of setae; mesosoma dark brown except scutellum orange / yellowish with a basal yellowish-white patch as in female and a few short blackish setae near apex, lacking a setal bunch; metasoma dark brown; legs yellowish; wings more or less hyaline; scape 4.6x longer than wide; funicle segments cylindrical, subequal, each about twice as long as wide, clothed with long seta; clava entire, as long as preceding two funicle segments, base of clava with 8 scale like setae; fore wing hyaline, 2.5x as long as wide; marginal vein shorter than stigmal; postmarginal vein very short; linea calva interrupted by 4 or 5 lines of seta.

Distribution
India: Rajasthan (); new record for southern India (Karnataka).

Biology
