Introduction
The European Commission published the European Community Biodiversity Strategy, providing a framework for development of Community policies and instruments in order to comply with the Convention on Biological Diversity. This Strategy recognises the current incomplete state of knowledge at all levels concerning biodiversity, which is a constraint on the successful implementation of the Convention. Fauna Europaea contributes to this Strategy by supporting one of the main themes: to identify and catalogue the components of European biodiversity into a database in order to serve as a basic tool for science and conservation policies.

With regard to biodiversity in Europe, both science and policies depend on a knowledge of its components. The assessment of biodiversity, monitoring changes, sustainable exploitation of biodiversity, and much legislative work depend upon a validated overview of taxonomic biodiversity. Towards this end Fauna Europaea plays a major role, providing a web-based information infrastructure with an index of scientific names (including important synonyms; i.e. alternative names still in use, or at lead found in recent literature) of all living European land and freshwater animals, their geographical distribution at country level and some additional useful information. In this sense, the Fauna Europaea database provides a unique reference for many user-groups such as scientists, governments, industries, conservation communities and educational programs.

Fauna Europaea started in 2000 as an EC-FP5 four-year project, delivering its first release in 2004. After thirteen years of steady progress, in order to improve the dissemination of Fauna Europaea results and to increase the general awareness and acknowledgement of Fauna Europaea contributors, novel e-Publishing tools have been used to prepare data papers of all 58 major taxonomic groups ().

Data-papers &amp; gap-analysis
In order to improve the dissemination and citation of Fauna Europaea and to increase the acknowledge of the Fauna Europaea contributors, a special Biodiversity Data Journal Series has been compiled using novel e-Publishing tools, called Contributions on Fauna Europaea, preparing data-papers of all major Fauna Europaea taxonomic groups. This work was initiated during the ViBRANT project and is further supported by the recently started EU BON project. This contribution represents the first publication of the Fauna Europaea Annelida–Hirudinea data sector as a BDJ data paper.

In the EU BON project () also further steps will be made on implementing Fauna Europaea as a basic tool for biodiversity research and for taxonomic expertise evaluation and management in Europe, using Fauna Europaea as a standard reference for taxonomic Information. The Fauna Europaea data-papers will contribute to a quality assessement on biodiversity data by providing estimates on gaps in taxonomic information and knowledge (see Table ).

General description
Purpose
Fauna Europaea is a database of the scientific names and distribution of all living, currently known European land and fresh-water animal species assembled by a large network of experts. An extended description of the Fauna Europaea project can be found in . A summary is given in the sections below.

The Annelida–Hirudinea, together with their allies Acanthobdellea and Branchiobdellea, are one of the 58 Fauna Europaea major taxonomic groups, covering 98 species (Fig. ). The data were acquired and checked by two specialists (Tables , ).

Additional information
The Hirudinea or leeches form a quite small group of macrophagous or blood-sucking annelids, including about 680 species (), probably derived from a lineage of freshwater oligochaetes. Their presence in the sea, and in terrestrial habitats, is secondary, following a primary radiation in freshwater habitats. About 15% of the ca. 680 species described thus far (), including many representatives of the Piscicolidae and all members of the Ozobranchidae, are marine; ca. 100 species (all members of the Americobdellidae, Cylicobdellidae, Haemadipsidae, Xerobdellidae, a few Hirudinidae and one member of the Salifidae) are terrestrial or semiterrestrial, all the remaining Hirudinea live in freshwater habitats. Three main feeding styles can be recognized among the leeches. The Rhynchobdellida, represented in the continental fauna of Europe by members of the Glossiphoniidae (Fig. ) and the Piscicolidae, are provided with a stiff protrusible proboscis through which they pierce the skin of their preys (cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates, mollusks, insect larvae) and suck their body fluids or tissues; within the Arhynchobdellida, many representatives of the Hirudiniformes (in Europe, those of the family Hirudinidae) are provided with toothed muscular ‘mandibles’ used to produce superficial wounds in the skin of their vertebrate hosts, the blood of which they feed on, while those of other families (in Europe, Haemopidae and Xerobdellidae (Fig. ), and also the Erpobdelliformes (only family Erpodbellidae native in Europe) are macrophagous and ingest whole preys, e.g. insect larvae, crustaceans, oligochaetes. Most leeches are temporary ectoparasites, their contact with their hosts being limited to the feeding phase, but many members of the Rhynchobdellida live more ore less permanently attached. All leeches are hermaphrodite. Large species may suck human blood. Hirudo spp. have been traditionally used in medicine.

The Annelida–Hirudinea database in Fauna Europaea includes also information on two smaller annelid groups, the Branchiobdellea and the Acanthobdellea, often treated in the past as members of the Hirudinea, in which case the true leeches (i.e., the Hirudinea of most current classifications) are often renamed Euhirudinea (e.g., ). Today, the Hirudinea (in strict sense, corresponding to Euhirudinea of other classifications), Branchiobdellea and Acanthobdellea are treated by most authorities as distinct lineages within the clitellate annelids, alongside the taxa traditionally grouped as the Oligochaeta, Acanthobdellea and Branchiobdellea. All Branchiobdellea, ca. 140 species worldwide (), are small (1–12 mm) freshwater worms that live on crustaceans, mainly crayfish. The Acanthobdellea, 2 species of cold riverine waters, are parasitic on fish, mainly salmon.

Molecular phylogenetic studies have heavily impacted on the internal classification of the Hirudinea (e.g., ) and more progress is expected from further studies. Detailed molecular systematics studies have shown gross errors in the traditional delineation of leech species, including the case of the European medicinal leech – a concept under which other species must be recognized besides Hirudo
medicinalis Linnaeus, 1758 (). On the other hand, reproductive isolation seems not to be completed between lineages currently treated as distinct species, such as within the same group of species (S. Utevsky, pers. com.). Discrepancies between the results of morphological vs. molecular systematic analyses have also been noted in other groups, as in the endemic lineage of Dina species inhabiting Lake Ochrid () and future reassessments are likely to increase the number of taxa worth recognition at the species level.

A revised delineation of genera and families is also suggested by a first molecular taxonomic study on Branchiobdellea ().

Project description
Title
This BDJ data paper includes the taxonomic indexing efforts in Fauna Europaea on European Annelida–Hirudinea covering the first two versions of Fauna Europaea worked on between 2000 and 2013 (up to version 2.6).

Personnel
The taxonomic framework of Fauna Europaea includes partner institutes, providing taxonomic expertise and information, and expert networks taking care of data collation.

Every taxonomic group is covered by at least one Group Coordinator responsible for the supervision and integrated input of taxonomic and distributional data for a particular group. The Fauna Europaea checklist would not have reached its current level of completion without the input from several groups of specialists. The formal responsibility of collating and delivering the data of relevant families rested with a number of Taxonomic Specialists Table . For Annelida–Hirudinea the Group Coordinator is Alessandro Minelli, who is also Taxonomic Specialist together with Boris Sket. Associate Specialist Serge Utevsky deserves credit for his important contributions at various levels, especially for Hirudinidae, and for distribution in Eastern European Table  countries.

A more detailed overview of the Fauna Europaea classification and expertise network for Annelida–Hirudinea can be found here: http://www.faunaeur.org/experts.php?id=80.

Data management tasks are taken care of by the Fauna Europaea project bureau. During the project phase (until 2004) a network of principal partners took care of diverse management tasks: Zoological Museum Amsterdam (general management &amp; system development), Zoological Museum of Copenhagen (data collation), National Museum of Natural History in Paris (data validation) and Museum and Institute of Zoology in Warsaw (NAS extension). Since the formal project ending (from 2004, till 2014) all tasks have been undertaken by the Zoological Museum Amsterdam.

Study area description
The area study covers the European mainland (Western Palearctic), including the Macaronesian islands, excluding the Caucasus, Turkey, Arabian Peninsula and Northern Africa (see: Geographic coverage).

Design description
Standards. Group coordinators and taxonomic specialists have to deliver the (sub)species names according to strict standards. The names provided by Fauna Europaea are scientific names. The taxonomic scope includes issues like, (1) the definition of criteria used to identify the accepted species-group taxa, (2) the hierarchy (classification scheme) for the accommodation of the all accepted species, (3) relevant synonyms, and (4) the correct nomenclature. The Fauna Europaea 'Guidelines for Group Coordinators and Taxonomic Specialists', include the standards, protocols, scope, and limits that provide the instructions for the more than 400 specialists contributing to the project, strictly following the provisions of the current edition of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Data management. The data records could either be entered offline into a preformatted MS-Excel worksheet or directly into the Fauna Europaea transaction database using an online browser interface (see Fig. ). Since 2013 the data servers are hosted at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin.

Data set. The Fauna Europaea basic data set consists of: accepted (sub)species names (including authorship), synonym names (including authorship), a taxonomic hierarchy/classification, misapplied names (including misspellings and alternative taxonomic views), homonym annotations, expert details, European distribution (at country level), Global distribution (only for European species), taxonomic reference (optional), occurrence reference (optional).

Funding
Fauna Europaea was funded by the European Commission under various framework programs (see Acknowledgement).

Sampling methods
Study extent
See spatial coverage and geographic coverage descriptions.

Sampling description
Fauna Europaea data have been assembled by principal taxonomic experts, based on their individual expertise, including literature sources, collection research, and field observations. In total no less than 476 experts contributed taxonomic and/or faunistic information to Fauna Europaea. The vast majority of the experts are from Europe (including EU non-member states). As a unique feature, Fauna Europaea funds were set aside for rewarding/compensating for the work of taxonomic specialists and group coordinators.

To facilitate data transfer and data import, sophisticated on-line (web interfaces) and off-line (spreadsheets) data-entry routines were built, integrated within an underlying central Fauna Europaea transaction database (see Fig. ).

A first release of the Fauna Europaea index via the web-portal has been presented on the 27th of September 2004, the most recent release (version 2.6.2) was launched on the 29th August 2013. An overview of Fauna Europaea releases can be found here: http://www.faunaeur.org/about_fauna_versions.php.

Quality control
Fauna Europaea data are unique in the sense that they are fully expert-based. Selecting leading experts for all groups assured the systematic reliability and consistency of the Fauna Europaea data.

Furthermore, all Fauna Europaea data sets are intensively reviewed at regional and thematic validation meetings, at review sessions on taxonomic symposia (for some groups), by Fauna Europaea Focal Points (during the FaEu-NAS and PESI projects) and by various end-users sending annotations using the web form at the web-portal. Additional validation on gaps and correct spelling was effected at the validation office in Paris.

In conclusion, in general we expect to get taxonomic data for 99.3% of the known European fauna. The faunistic coverage is not quite as good, but is nevertheless 90–95% of the total fauna. For the Annelida–Hirudinea (this paper) the taxonomic coverage is 100% (see Table ), but the distribution by country is still incomplete, especially for the Branchiobdellea.

Checks on technical and logical correctness of the data have been implemented in the data entry tools, including around 50 "Taxonomic Integrity Rules". This validation tool proved to be of huge value for both the experts and project management, and contributed significantly to preparation of a remarkably clean and consistent data set. This thorough reviewing makes Fauna Europaea the most scrutinised data sets in its domain.

Step description
By evaluating team structure and life cycle procedures (data-entry, validation, updating, etc.), clear definitions of roles of users and user-groups, according to the taxonomic framework were established, including ownership and read and writes privileges, and their changes during the project life-cycle. In addition, guidelines on common data exchange formats and codes have been issued (see also the 'Guidelines for Experts' document).

Geographic coverage
Description
Species and subspecies distributions in Fauna Europaea are registered at least a country level, i.e. for political countries. For this purpose the FaEu geographical system basically follows the TDWG standards. The covered area includes the European mainland (Western Palearctic), plus the Macaronesian islands (excl. Cape Verde Islands), Cyprus, Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya. Western Kazakhstan and the Caucasus are excluded (see Fig. ).

The focus is on species (or subspecies) of European animals of terrestrial and freshwater environments. Species in brackish waters, occupying the marine/freshwater or marine/terrestrial transition zones, are generally excluded.

Coordinates
Mediterranean (N 35°) and Arctic Islands (N 82°) Latitude; Atlantic Ocean (Mid-Atlantic Ridge) (W 30°) and Ural (E 60°) Longitude.

Taxonomic coverage
Description
The Fauna Europaea database contains the scientific names of all living European land and freshwater animal species, including numerous infra-groups and synonyms. More details about the conceptual background of Fauna Europaea and standards followed are described above and in the project description paper(s).

This data paper covers the Annelida–Hirudinea content of Fauna Europaea, including 9 families, 98 species, 9 subspecies and 42 (sub)species synonyms (see Fig. ).

All species described to date are included in the current version of the data base. We may expect a future increase of species numbers for Erpobdellidae (ca 10 or even more species), and perhaps one or two species in other families, e.g. Glossiphoniidae and Piscicolidae (see Table ). A reliable assessment of the expected number of species is not feasible at present for the Branchiobdellidae.

Fauna Europaea was funded by the European Commission under the Fifth Framework Programme and contributed to the Support for Research Infrastructures work programme with Thematic Priority Biodiversity (EVR1-1999-20001) for a period of four years (1 March 2000 - 1 March 2004), including a short 'NAS extension', allowing EU candidate accession countries to participate. Follow-up support was given by the EC-FP5 EuroCAT project (EVR1-CT-2002-20011), by the EC-FP6 ENBI project (EVK2-CT-2002-20020), by the EC-FP6 EDIT project (GCE 018340), by the EC-FP7 PESI project (RI-223806) and by the EC-FP7 ViBRANT project (RI-261532). Continuing management and hosting of the Fauna Europaea services was supported by the University of Amsterdam (Zoological Museum Amsterdam) and SARA/Vancis. Recently the hosting of Fauna Europaea is taken over by the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, supported by the EC-FP7 EU BON project (grant agreement №308454).
