K+ (KATP) channels, acquire resistance to
myocardial ischaemia. However, the mechanism of SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection is
yet to be fully understood. Adenoviral SUR2A construct (AV-SUR2A) increased
SUR2A expression, number of KATP channels and subsarcolemmal
ATP in glycolysis-sensitive manner in H9C2 cells. It also increased
K+ current in response to chemical hypoxia, partially
preserved subsarcolemmal ATP and increased cell survival. Kir6.2AFA, a mutant
form of Kir6.2 with largely decreased K+ conductance, abolished
the effect of SUR2A on K+ current, did not affect SUR2A-induced
increase in subsarcolemmal ATP and partially inhibited SUR2A-mediated
cytoprotection. Infection with 193gly-M-LDH, an inactive mutant of muscle
lactate dehydrogenase, abolished the effect of SUR2A on K+
current, subsarcolemmal ATP and cell survival; the effect of 193gly-M-LDH on
cell survival was significantly more pronounced than those of Kir6.2AFA. We
conclude that AV-SUR2A increases resistance to metabolic stress in H9C2 cells by
increasing the number of sarcolemmal KATP channels and
subsarcolemmal ATP.

1 Introduction
Cardiac sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive K+
(KATP) channels are gated by intracellular ATP and are
viewed as a link between cellular metabolism and membrane excitability. These
channels are closed under physiological conditions and are opened only during
ischaemia, which protect the myocardium against ischaemic damage. Structurally,
sarcolemmal KATP channels in vivo are
composed of an inward rectifier, Kir6.2 and Kir6.1, SUR2A, an ATP-binding
protein, and accessory proteins that are glycolytic and ATP-producing enzymes
[reviewed in 1]. Recently, it has been
shown that cardiomyocytes from transgenic mice overexpressing
KATP channel regulatory subunit, SUR2A, acquire resistance
against hypoxia and other types of metabolic stresses. The mechanism of
SUR2A-mediated cardioprotection seems to be associated with increased numbers of
sarcolemmal KATP channels, earlier activation of
KATP channels during stress, shortening of the action
membrane potential and consequent decrease in Ca2+ influx
[2]. It should be, however, said
that in some recent studies a mechanism of cytoprotection afforded by
KATP channels independent from the channel activity was
reported. More specifically, it has been suggested that enzymes that are
physically associated with KATP channel subunits regulate
subsarcolemmal/intracellular ATP levels, which, in turn, promotes cellular
survival under metabolic stress [3-5]. It is therefore possible that SUR2A-mediated
cardioprotection has a component in addition to the increased channel
activity.

Therefore, we have undertaken this research to elucidate the
channel-dependent and channel-independent mechanisms of SUR2A-mediated
cytoprotection. It has been shown that rat heart embryonic H9C2 cells are good
experimental model to study SUR2A, KATP channels and
cardioprotection [6]. As an example,
these cells have been used to uncover the effect of increased SUR2A expression
on cellular response to metabolic stress [7,8], which was shown to correspond to adult hearts
exposed to hypoxia [2]. Here, we have
generated adenovirus containing gene encoding SUR2A and tested the effect that
this construct has on survival of H9C2 cells exposed to severe metabolic stress.
We have elucidated the mechanism underlying SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection and
found out that there is more to the cardioprotection by SUR2A than previously
thought.

2 Methods
2.1 H9C2 cells and viral constructs
H9C2 cell rat embryonic heart H9c2 cells (ECACC, Salisbury, UK) were
cultured in a tissue flask (at 5% CO2) containing
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
and 2 mM glutamine. For electrophysiological experiments,
the cells were plated on a 35 × 10-mm
culture dish containing 25-mm glass cover-slips. The cells were cultured in
incubators (Galaxy, oxygen control model, RS Biotech, Irvine, UK). For the
experiments H9C2 cells were infected with adenoviral constructs containing
either green fluorescent protein (GFP, gift from C. Sunderland, University
of Dundee; cells infected with GFP have served as control cells in this
study), gly193-M-LDH (a catalytically inactive mutant of M-LDH,
[9], Kir6.2, or Kir6.2AFA (a
mutant form of Kir6.2 where the pore GFG was mutated into AFA leading to
largely reduced K+ conductance, [10]). When intracellular and subsarcolemmal ATP levels
were measured cells were infected with adenovirus containing luciferase and
annexin VI-luciferase genes respectively. All these adenoviruses were
generated and used as described in details in [4,5]. The recombinant SUR2A
adenovirus (AV-SUR2A) was generated using the AdEasy XL Adenoviral Vector
System (Stratagene). SUR2A gene was cloned into a shuttle vector
pShuttle-CMV by PCR using the following primers containing restrict enzyme
sites Bgl II/Xho I, sense, 5′-GCAGATCT GGC AGG CTG TTG GTA GCT CA-3′,
antisense, 5′-GCCTCGAG CTA CTT GTT GGT CAT CAC CA-3. The positive clones
containing DNA inserts were linearized with Pme I and transformed into
BJ5183-AD-1 competent cells to perform homologous recombination in
Escherichia coli between the shuttle vectors
carrying SUR2A gene and a large adenovirus containing plasmid following
electroporation. Recombinants were identified from single colonies,
linearized, and then transfected into HEK293 cells to produce infective
adenovirus virions. Adenoviral particles were obtained by cell extraction
after 7–10 days of transfection, and the primary virus was
further amplified by infection of AD-293 cultures, amplified virus stock is
prepared by 4 rounds of freeze/thaw. The virus titer is determined using
QuickTiter Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. To infect H9C2 cells, a solution of
recombinant adenovirus was mixed with culture medium, and cells were exposed
to the virus with a multiplicity of 10 viral particles/cell for 48 h.

2.2 Real time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from heart of rat H9C2 cells using TRIZOL
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's
recommendations. Extracted RNA was further purified by RNeasy Plus Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Crawley, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat
primers for all KATP channel subunits were designed as
depicted on Table 1. All
KATP channel subunits were measured using these primers
apart on SUR2A that was measured by combining SUR2A rat (Table 1) and mouse (sense:
ACTATGGAGTCCGAGAACTA, antisense: AGGTTTGGACCAGTATCACA) primers. The
structural similarity between mouse and rat SUR2A is 93%, but the primers
used for mouse SUR2A do not recognize RAT SUR2A and
vice
versa. Therefore, we have used mouse SUR2A to make
adenoviral construct, so that we can examine the level of adenoviral SUR2A
expression in host H9C2 cells. To measure total SUR2A mRNA levels we have
combined both sets of primers. The reverse transcription (RT) reaction was
carried out with ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK).
A final volume of 20 µl of RT reaction containing 4 µl of 5× buffer, 3 mM
MgCl2, 20 U of RNasin® Ribonuclease
inhibitor, 1 U of ImProm-II reverse transcriptase,
0.5 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 0.5 µg of oligo(dT), and 1 µg of RNA was
incubated at 42 °C for 1 h and then
inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. The
resulting cDNA was used as a template for real time PCR. A SYBR Green I
system was used for the RT-PCR and the 25 µl reaction
mixture contained: 12.5 µl of iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix
(2×), 7.5 nM each primers, 9 µl of
ddH2O, and 2 µl of cDNA. In
principle, the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial
denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 10 s of
denaturing at 95 °C, 15 s of annealing
at 56 °C, and 30 s of extension at
72 °C. The real time PCR was performed in the same
wells of a 96-well plate in the iCycler iQ™ Multicolor Real-Time Detection
System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Data was collected following each cycle and
displayed graphically (iCycler iQ™ Real-Time Detection System Software,
version 3.0A, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Primers were tested for their ability
to produce no signal in negative controls by dimer formation and then with
regard to the efficiency of the PCR reaction. Efficiency is evaluated by the
slope of the regression curve obtained with several dilutions of the cDNA
template. Melting curve analysis tested the specificity of primers.
Threshold cycle values, PCR efficiency (examined by serially diluting the
template cDNA and performing PCR under these conditions) and PCR specificity
(by constructing the melting curve) were determined by the same software.
Each mouse cDNA sample was measured at three different quantities (and
duplicated at each concentration, the corresponding no-RT mRNA sample was
included as a negative control (blank). To determine relative mRNA
expression (normalised to the wild type) we have used glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a control gene. The calculation of
relative mRNA expression was performed as described [11]. The relative expression ratio
(R) of SUR2A is calculated using equation
R = (EK)ΔCPK(WT-TG)/(ER)ΔCPR(WT-TG)
where EK is the real time PCR
efficiency of SUR2A gene transcript,
ER is the real time PCR
efficiency of GAPDH gene, ΔCPK is the crossing point
deviation of wild type-transgene (infected) of SUR2A gene transcript while
ΔCPR is the crossing point deviation of wild
type-transgene of GAPDH gene transcript.

2.3 Patch clamp electrophysiology
To monitor whole cell K+ current the gigaohm seal
patch clamp technique was applied in the perforated-patch whole cell
configuration. H9C2 cells were superfused with Tyrode solution (in mM: 136.5
NaCl; 5.4 KCl; 1.8 CaCl2; 0.53 MgCl2; 5.5
glucose; 5.5 HEPES-NaOH; pH 7.4). All pipettes (resistance 3–5 MΩ), were filled with (in mM): KCl 140,
MgCl2 1, HEPES-KOH 5 and amphotericin B (Sigma,
240 μg/ml) (pH 7.3). For all cells monitored, the
membrane potential was normally held at − 40 mV and the currents evoked by a series of 400 ms depolarising and hyperpolarising current steps (− 100 mV to + 80 mV in 20 mV steps) recorded directly to
hard disk using an Axopatch-200B amplifier, Digidata-1321 interface and
pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Forster City, CA). The capacitance
compensation was adjusted to null the additional whole cell capacitative
current. The slow capacitance component measured by this procedure was used
as an approximation of the cell surface area and allowed normalisation of
current amplitude (i.e. current density). Currents were low pass filtered at
2 kHz and sampled at 100 μs
intervals.

2.4 Cell survival assay
The survival of H9C2 cells was assayed using Multitox-Fluor Multiplex
Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, H9C2 cells were plated in complete
media (DMEM containing 10% FCS) in 96-well plate, the recombinant adenovirus
(GFP as a control or other adenoviruses as stated in the Results section) was added to the wells at
the multiplicity of infection of 10. After a 48 h
infection, the DNP was added to each well at the final concentration of
10 mM. To measure cell survival 6 h
later, the peptide substrate (GF-AFC) that can be cleaved only by live cells
was added to the each well. Following a 30 min-long
incubation at 37 °C, plates were measured using 1420
Multibabel Counter (Victor) plate reader, with excitation at 370 nm and emissions of 480 nm. The percentage
of live cells was calculated based on the intensity of fluorescence
according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.5 Luciferase assay
H9C2 cells were co-infected with adenoviruses containing genes encoding
luciferase (to measure total ATP) or annexin-luciferase (to measure
subsarcolemmal ATP) together with adenoviruses containing genes encoding
KATP channel-forming proteins (as named in the
Results section) 48 h before luciferase assay. To measure luciferase luminescence
cells were mounted in 96-well plate in buffer with the following composition
(in mM): 30 HEPES, 3 ATP, 15 MgSO4, 10 DTT; pH: 7.4. Some
of the cells were untreated while the others were treated with 10 mM DNP. The reaction for luciferase luminescence measurement
was initiated by adding 100 μM of luciferin and the
luminescence was measured on a plate reader 1420 Multibabel Counter
(Victor). Luminescence was measured in the absence of DNP and after 1 h of cell incubation with 10 mM DNP. To
validate that annexin-luciferase- and luciferase-mediated signal reflect
subsarcolemmal and cytosolic ATP respectively, cells were infected with
either luciferase, annexin-luciferase or GFP (control), harvested after
48 h and plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions were
obtained as described in [7]. The
presence/absence of plasma membrane in a fraction was verified by
5-nucleotidase assay. Luminescence was measured as described above; in
membrane and cytosolic fractions (both spiked with 5 mM
ATP) of cells infected with annexin-luciferase the luminescence signal was
6956 AU/mg protein and 480 AU/mg
protein respectively. These results demonstrated that targeted expression of
luciferase to membrane was successful and that signal in
vivo reflects mostly the level of ATP in environment
surrounding the plasma membrane. On the other hand, in cells infected with
luciferase, luminescence was 1030 AU/mg protein in
cytosolic fraction and 670 AU/mg protein in membrane
fraction showing ubiquitous distribution of luciferase.

2.6 Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting
The cells were homogenised in buffer (TRIS 10 mM,
NaH2PO4 20 mM, EDTA
1 mM, PMSF 0.1 mM, pepstatin
10 μg/ml, leupeptin 10 μg/ml, at
pH = 7.8) and centrifugated at
500 g (to remove large
particles from the homogenate). To obtain cellular membrane fraction cells
were homogenised in buffer I (TRIS 10 mM,
NaH2PO4 20 mM, EDTA
1 mM, PMSF 0.1 mM, pepstatin
10 μg/ml, leupeptin 10 μg/ml, at
pH = 7.8) and incubated for
20 min (at 4 °C). The osmolarity was
restored with KCl, NaCl and sucrose and the obtained mixture was
centrifugated at 500 g. The
supernatant was diluted in buffer II (imidazole 30 mM, KCl
120 mM, NaCl 30 mM,
NaH2PO4 20 mM,
sucrose 250 mM, pepstatin 10 μg/ml,
leupeptin 10 μg/ml, at pH = 6.8) and centrifugated at 7000 g, pellet removed and supernatant centrifugated
at 30 000 g. The
obtained pellet contains membrane fraction. Protein concentration was
determined using the method of Bradford; 10 µg of the
anti-Kir6.2 antibody was prebound to Protein-G Sepharose beads and used to
immunoprecipitate from 50 µg of membrane fraction protein
extract. The pellets of this precipitation were run on SDS-polyacrylamide
gels for Western analysis. Western blot probing was performed using 1/1000
dilution of anti-SUR2 or anti-LDH antibody, respectively, and detection was
achieved using Protein-G HRP and ECL reagents. The band intensities were
analysed using the Quantiscan software.

2.7 Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM,
with n representing the number of independent
experiments. Mean values were compared by the ANOVA followed by Student's
t-test or by Student's
t-test alone where appropriate using SigmaStat
program (Jandel Scientific, Chicago, Illinois).
P &lt; 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

3 Results
3.1 Infection with SUR2A increases the level of SUR2A in H9C2
cells
We have analysed levels of SUR2A mRNA in control cells and cells
infected with AV-SUR2A using real time RT-PCR. This method has revealed that
infection with AV-SUR2A has significantly increased mRNA levels of SUR2A
(cycling threshold was 23.20 ± 0.10 in
control cells and 21.05 ± 0.05 in
infected cells, n = 4 for each, P &lt; 0.01, Fig. 1). No statistically
significant difference was observed in mRNA levels of other
KATP channel-forming subunits (Fig. 1). It is estimated that infected cells
had 4.22 times more SUR2A mRNA than the control cells. Furthermore, we have
probed anti-Kir6.2 immunoprecipitate of H9C2 extract with anti-SUR2
antibody. Using this strategy, we measured only those Kir6.2 and SUR2A
subunits that physically assemble in sarcolemma to form a channel. Western
blot has demonstrated that the level of myocardial SUR2A protein was
increased in H9C2 cells in comparison to control cells (Fig. 1). Another protein known to be a part
of the sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex, GAPDH
[12], was also increased in
cell infected with SUR2A (Fig. 1).

It is well established that KATP channels are
activated when cardiac cells are challenged with 2.4-dinitrophenol (DNP).
This channel activation is cellular self-protective mechanism as it
hyperpolarize the membrane, inhibits influx of Ca2+ and
counteracts DNP-induced cellular damage [13–16]. We have applied
perforated patch clamp electrophysiology to test whether infection with
AV-SUR2A has any effect on DNP-induced whole cell K+
current. Perforated patch whole cell recording does not impair intracellular
milieu [17], which allows
monitoring the behaviour of KATP channels-conducted
K+ current during stress under conditions of intact
intracellular environment. In control cells, exposure to DNP (10 mM) has induced a significant increase in whole cell
K+ current flowed through KATP
channels [see also 4,5],
but this was more pronounced in cells infected with SUR2A (Fig. 2).

3.2 Infection with SUR2A increase cellular resistance to severe
metabolic stress
DNP is known metabolic inhibitor that is used to induce metabolic
stress in different cell types [18]. When control cells were treated with DNP
(10 mM), only 43.3 ± 1.8% (n = 14) of cells have survived this insult (Fig. 3).
Cells infected with SUR2A were significantly more resistant to DNP
(10 mM) than control cells (58.9 ± 2.0% of cells infected with SUR2A have survived
DNP, n = 8,
P &lt; 0.001
when compared to the control, Fig. 3). On the other hand, infection with Kir6.2 alone
did not have any effect on cellular survival under DNP (10 mM; 45.9% ± 2.6%,
n = 3,
P = 0.93 when
compared to the control cells, Fig. 3) neither infection with SUR2A/Kir6.2 improved the
effect of SUR2A alone (53.2% ± 4.1%,
n = 3,
P = 0.28 when
compared with cells infected with SUR2A alone, Fig. 3).

3.3 Infection with Kir6.2AFA abolishes DNP-induced
K+ current in control and cells infected with
SUR2A
Kir6.2AFA is a mutant Kir6.2 form with largely reduced ability to
conduct K+. When Kir6.2AFA is introduced into H9C2 cells
DNP does not induce increase in K+ current, which is in
agreement with notion that treatment with DNP activates sarcolemmal
KATP channels [4,5]. In cells infected with SUR2A/Kir6.2AFA DNP did
not induce increase in whole cell K+ current (Fig. 4).

3.4 Kir6.2AFA only partially reduces the SUR2A-mediated
cytoprotective effect
In cells infected with Kir6.2AFA alone, survival rate in 10 mM DNP-treated cells was 39.1 ± 1.4% (n = 6) and that was slightly, but significantly, lower than
survival of the control cells (43.3 ± 1.8%, n = 14;
Fig. 5). A concomitant infection of H9C2 cells with SUR2A and
Kir6.2AFA has resulted in cell survival of 47.3 ± 1.2% (n = 5), which was significantly lower than survival in cells
infected with SUR2A (58.9 ± 2.0%,
n = 8,
P &lt; 0.01),
but significantly higher than survival in cells infected with Kir6.2AFA
alone (47.3 ± 1.2% with Kir6.2AFA/SUR2A
n = 5,
P &lt; 0.001
when compared to Kir6.2AFA cells, Fig. 5).

3.5 Infection with SUR2A increases levels of subsarcolemmal ATP in
H9C2 cells
Sarcolemmal KATP channel complex seems to contain,
besides the channel subunits, glycolytic and other enzymes that catalyses
reactions producing ATP [9,12,19–22].
Anything that would increase the levels of ATP would improve cellular well
being under different conditions of stress. Therefore, we have tested the
levels of intracellular and subsarcolemmal ATP using luciferase and
annexin-luciferase constructs respectively. Infection of SUR2A did not
significantly change intracellular level of ATP (the intensity of luciferase
luminescence was 144.8 ± 5.3 AU in control and 142.8 ± 8.9 AU in SUR2A cells,
n = 5,
P = 0.85,
Fig. 6). However, infection with SUR2A did increase
subsarcolemmal levels of ATP (the intensity of annexin-luciferase
luminescence was 204.8 ± 9.0 AU in control and 284.6 ± 20.4 AU in SUR2A cells,
n = 5,
P = 0.01,
Fig. 6). After treatment with
DNP (10 mM) total intracellular ATP levels were not
different in control cells and cells infected with SUR2A (the intensity of
luciferase luminescence was 57.6 ± 2.4 AU in control cells and 63.0 ± 2.5 AU in SUR2A cells,
n = 5,
P = 0.16,
Fig. 6). In contrast,
subsarcolemmal ATP levels were significantly increased in SUR2A-infected
cells (the intensity of annexin-luciferase luminescence was 71.8 ± 2.1 AU in control cells
and 96.8 ± 2.4 AU in
SUR2A cells, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 6).

An increased ATP levels in subsarcolemmal space would be in accord with
the idea that enzymes physically associated with the KATP
channel subunits produce ATP and that infection with SUR2A increases number
of ATP-producing KATP channel protein complexes
[4,5]. So far, five
glycolytic enzymes were identified as parts of sarcolemmal
KATP channel protein complex [9,10,22]. Here, to test
whether SUR2A-mediated increase in subsarcolemmal ATP is associated with
glycolysis, we have examine the effect of 2-deoxyglucose on SUR2A-mediated
increase in cytosolic and subsarcolemmal ATP. 2-deoxyglucose (50 mM) blocked the effect of SUR2A on subsarcolemmal ATP (the
intensity of annexin-luciferase luminescence was 241.6 ± 11.1 AU in control cells and
212.2 ± 12.8 AU in
SUR2A cells, n = 5, P = 0.12,
Fig. 6). SUR2A also did not
affect intracellular ATP levels in cells treated by 2-deoxyglucose
(50 mM; the intensity of luciferase luminescence was
154.4 ± 10.8 AU in
control cells and 151.0 ± 5.2 AU in SUR2A cells, n = 5, P = 0.78, Fig. 6).

3.6 Expression of Kir6.2AFA does not modify effect of SUR2A on ATP
levels
It is already known that infection with Kir6.2AFA per
se does not affect either total or subsarcolemmal ATP levels
[4]. When Kir6.2AFA cells were
infected with SUR2A no changes in intracellular ATP was observed (the
intensity of luminescence was 494.0 ± 31.2 AU in Kir6.2AFA and 493.6 ± 59.7 AU in Kir6.2AFA/SUR2A
cells, n = 5,
P = 0.99,
Fig. 7). However, infection with SUR2A has significantly
increased the levels of subsarcolemmal ATP (the intensity of luminescence
was 688.2 ± 140.7 AU
in Kir6.2AFA and 1787.2 ± 148.9 AU in Kir6.2AFA/SUR2A cells, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 7). After treatment with DNP (10 mM), intracellular ATP levels were also not different between the cellular
phenotypes (the intensity of luminescence was 133.4 ± 16.1 AU in Kir6.2AFA and
125.4 ± 16.9 AU in
Kir6.2AFA/SUR2A cells, n = 5, P = 0.74, Fig. 7), as
opposed to the level of subsarcolemmal ATP that was significantly increased
in cells infected with SUR2A (the intensity of luminescence was 114.3 ± 6.5 AU in Kir6.2AFA and
204.0 ± 7.6 AU in
Kir6.2AFA/SUR2A cells, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 7).

3.7 193glyM-LDH inhibits the effect of SUR2A on subsarcolemmal ATP
and DNP-induced K+ current
We have recently shown that 193glyM-LDH, a mutant form of muscle
lactate dehydrogenase (M-LDH) that has lost its catalytic activity while
retained the ability to physically interact with Kir6.2/SUR2A, inhibits both
DNP-induced KATP channel activation and ATP production by
sarcolemmal KATP channels [4]. In cells infected with both SUR2A and 193glyM-LDH,
DNP did not increase whole cell K+ current (Fig. 8A). The
luciferase luminescence in cells infected with both SUR2A and 193glyM-LDH
was 176.6 ± 22.8 AU
(n = 5) and
that was not significantly different from those infected with SUR2A alone
where luciferase fluorescence was 142.8 ± 8.9 AU (n = 5, P = 0.23 when compared to SUR2A/193glyM-LDH cells,
Fig. 8B). The
annexin-luciferase fluorescence was 326.8 ± 28.1 AU (n = 5) in SUR2A/193glyM-LDH cells which was
significantly lower than those in SUR2A cells (annexin-luciferase
fluorescence was 496.4 ± 45.8 in SUR2A
cells, P = 0.01
when compared to SUR2A/193glyM-LDH cells, n = 5, Fig. 8B). Similar results were obtained when ATP levels
were measured after treatment with DNP (10 mM). For cells
infected with SUR2A alone, luciferase and annexin-luciferase fluorescence
were 64.8 ± 6.6 AU and
91.4 ± 9.9 AU
respectively (n = 5 for all; Fig. 8B). Both of
these values were significantly higher than in cells infected with
SUR2A/193glyM-LDH (luciferase: 49.8 ± 2.1 AU, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001 when compared to SUR2A cells;
annexin-luciferase: 57.2 ± 3.6 AU, n = 5, P &lt; 0.001 when compared to SUR2A cells, Fig. 8B).

3.8 193glyM-LDH inhibits SUR2A-mediated
cytoprotection
193glyM-LDH has shown to simultaneously inhibit both mechanisms that
could contribute to the SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection (increase in
subsarcolemmal ATP and increase in K+ current). Therefore,
we have assessed the effect that 193glyM-LDH has on SUR2A-mediated
cytoprotection. Cells co-infected with SUR2A/193glyM-LDH were significantly
more sensitive to DNP (10 mM) than cells infected with
SUR2A alone (cell survival was 11.1 ± 1.6% for SUR2A/193glyM-LDH cells and 58.3 ± 1.6% for SUR2A cells, n = 3–6, P &lt; 0.001, Fig. 9) and cells
co-infected with SUR2A/Kir6.2AFA (cell survival was 47.3 ± 1.6% in these cells,
n = 6,
P &lt; 0.001
when compared to SUR2A/193glyM-LDH cells).

4 Discussion
In the present study we have shown that SUR2A mediate cardioprotection by
increasing the numbers of sarcolemmal KATP channels and
consequent increase in K+ current and subsarcolemmal ATP
levels.

It has been previously shown that moderate increase in SUR2A generates a
myocardial phenotype with increased numbers of sarcolemmal KATP
channels and increased resistance to ischaemia–reperfusion [2]. In this particular phenotype SUR2A
expression was under control of CMV promoter, which is the promoter used in
AV-SUR2A in this study as well. Under CMV promoter SUR2A mRNA in hearts of
transgenic animals was increased for ∼ 6 times in comparison
to the wild type [2], which is similar
to those in H9C2 cells achieved by AV-SUR2A. This modest up-regulation of SUR2A
has resulted in increased number of sarcolemmal KATP channels,
which is in accord to what has been observed in transgenic CMV-SUR2A phenotype
[2]. It should be mentioned that a
transgenic phenotype overexpressing SUR2A by action of αMHC promoter has
decreased the number of sarcolemmal KATP channels [23]. However, as opposed to infected H9C2
cells, in the phenotype described by Flagg et al. mRNA SUR2A levels were
increased by ∼ 50 times. It has been reported that cardiac
Kir6.2 mRNA levels are physiologically ∼ 30 times higher than
those values of SUR2A [2]. How this
transpose into difference at protein level is not yet known, but it is likely
that some difference between protein levels also exist. It is therefore possible
that stimulating expression of SUR2A over the levels of Kir6.2 expression would
suppress the functional expression of KATP channels from
optimized dimeric SUR2A/Kir6.2. A similar idea about the regulation of
KATP channel numbers has been put forward by Flagg et al.
[23] and this could explain why a
moderate, but not extreme, increase in SUR2A levels results in increased number
of sarcolemmal KATP channels.

DNP is a known metabolic inhibitor that was used in many studies to induce
metabolic stress in different cell types [18]. When applied, this compound induces chemical hypoxia,
which activates KATP channels [24]. In turn, such activation of the channels decreases a
degree of cell injury [13]. The
finding that DNP-induced K+ current was increased in cells
infected with SUR2A is in accord with these cells having increased number of
sarcolemmal KATP channels. An increase in sarcolemmal
KATP channels is associated with increased myocardial
resistance to metabolic stress [7,8,25]. However, there is a report suggesting that a lack
of SUR2A, but not Kir6.2 [26],
generates a cardiac phenotype with increased resistance to ischaemia/reperfusion
[27]. Most recently, this has
been explained by the presence of a short SUR2A form in mitochondria when it
plays a cardioprotective role that remained unaffected in SUR2A knockout
phenotype [28]. On the other hand,
transgenic mice with moderately increased expression of SUR2A also acquire
resistance to metabolic stress, which was explained by increase in numbers of
sarcolemmal KATP channels and earlier channel activation in
response to metabolic stress [2].
Here, we have shown that an acute increase in SUR2A expression confers
cytoprotection, which would be in accord with reports associating increased
SUR2A with the cardioprotective outcome [29].

The mechanism of cytoprotection afforded by KATP channels
is a long-standing issue. It is predominant view that the activation of the
channel is required for KATP channels to protect the heart
against metabolic stress [30]. How
opening of sarcolemmal KATP channels protect the heart against
metabolic stress is still to be fully understood. It is traditional view that
the activation of KATP channels shortens action membrane
potential resulting in decreased influx of Ca2+ and prevention
of Ca2+ overload [30]. However, it has been shown that the activation of
KATP channels is protective in cells that do not generate
action membrane potential, including diastolic cardiomyocytes [14–16]. More recently, we have
suggested that cytoprotection afforded by KATP channels could
also involve a channel activity-independent mechanism [4,5]. Specifically, it has been found
that inhibition of the catalytic activity of M-LDH, an enzyme physically
associated with sarcolemmal KATP channels [9], results in decreased ATP levels as well as
inhibited KATP channels-mediated K+ current in
response to stress. The inhibition of both the channel activity and ATP
production had much more pronounced effect on cell survival than a sole
inhibition of channel activity [4,5]. Based on these findings, it was concluded that
production of ATP by sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex
is a significant part of the mechanism underlying KATP
channel-mediated cardioprotection. In the present study, we have shown that
increase in SUR2A expression increases subsarcolemmal ATP levels even under
control conditions. This would support the notion that sarcolemmal
KATP channel protein complex produces ATP and that this
property could be important even under physiological conditions. The structural
studies of KATP channels have shown that channel subunits
in vivo are physically associated with enzymes that
catalyses ATP production, most of them being involved in glycolysis
[9,12,22]. Such
composition of sarcolemmal KATP channels would allow a
supposition that KATP channel protein complex could serve as
ATP-producing machinery in the sarcolemma. To test hypothesis that production of
ATP by glycolytic enzymes physically associated with KATP
channel subunits mediates the effect of SUR2A on subsarcolemmal ATP, we have
used 2-deoxyglucose, a known inhibitor of glycolysis. Treatment with this
compound abolished the effect of SUR2A on subsarcolemmal ATP showing that
glycolysis is essential for the observed SUR2A effect. This would be in
agreement with the idea that ATP produced by glycolytic enzymes physically
associated with KATP channel subunits underlies SUR2A-mediated
increase in subsarcolemmal ATP levels. The fact that SUR2A counteracted
DNP-induced loss of subsarcolemmal ATP further supports our hypothesis that
fully assembled KATP channel protein complexes might serve as
an ATP producer in vivo. It would be logical to expect
that more subsarcolemmal ATP would support ion homeostasis by providing energy
for active transport processes.

As opposed to Kir6.2AFA that inhibits KATP channels
permeability without affecting subsarcolemmal ATP levels, 193glyM-LDH has
effects on both the channel activity and subsarcolemmal ATP [4]. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a tetramer
composed of either M (muscle) and/or H (heart) subunits, which may be combined
to form five LDH isozymes. In the heart, all LDH isozymes are present;
LDH1 (H4) is the predominant form, whereas
LDH5 (M4) is present in trace amounts [31]. It has been shown that M-LDH, but not
H-LDH, physically associates with Kir6.2 and SUR2A subunits and is integral part
of the sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complex [9]. DNP is a known inhibitor of oxidative
phosphorylation, but the mechanism of DNP-induced activation of sarcolemmal
KATP channels is less associated with decrease of
intracellular ATP and more with increase in intracellular lactate levels and
acidification [32–35]. It seems that lactate directly targets and
activates KATP channels despite the presence of high
intracellular levels of ATP while low pH counteract the channel inhibition
induced by ATP [36]. It has been
demonstrated, at the both recombinant and native levels, that M-LDH physically
associated with KATP channels is required, by virtue of its
catalytic activity, for the channel opening during metabolic stress
[4,5,9]. It has been
suggested that M-LDH-produced lactate 1) targets and activates
KATP channels and 2) decreases the channel sensitivity to
inhibitory effect of ATP [36,37]. At the same time M-LDH activity contributes to the
ATP production. The expression of 193glyM-LDH, a catalytically inactive form of
M-LDH, has been shown to inhibit both M-LDH properties to activate
KATP channels (by producing lactate) and counteract
DNP-induced decrease in subsarcolemmal ATP. Here, we have shown that infection
with 193glyM-LDH abolishes SUR2A-mediated increase in K+
current as well as increase in subsarcolemmal ATP levels. This finding is in
accord with our hypothesis that infection with AV-SUR2A has increased the number
of sarcolemmal KATP channel protein complexes that are both
important for subsarcolemmal ATP levels and K+ current in
response to metabolic stress. An increase in subsarcolemmal ATP and
KATP channel activation might look as a contradiction.
However, it is known that ischaemia opens sarcolemmal KATP
channels before the fall of intracellular ATP occur [38], suggesting that the intracellular level of ATP is not
the only factor that regulates the channel activity. In addition to ATP, it has
been suggested that the activity of these channels may be regulated by other
nucleotides, intracellular pH, lactate, cytoskeleton, protein kinase C,
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, and by the operative condition of the
channel itself [39]. It is well
established that lactate activates KATP channels in the
presence of millimolar ATP, though the mechanism of this activation is yet
unknown [9]. Therefore, it is quite
possible that M-LDH catalytic activity results in both increase in
subsarcolemmal ATP (the effect of ATP production) and KATP
channel activity (the effect of lactate production). How significant is increase
in subsarcolemmal ATP for SUR2A-mediated cell survival was assessed by comparing
the effect of DNP in cell expressing SUR2A/Kir6.2AFA (inhibited channel activity
without changes in subsarcolemmal ATP) and cells expressing SUR2A/193glyM-LDH
(inhibited channel activity as well as increase in subsarcolemmal ATP). It has
been found that, unlike Kir6.2AFA, expression of 193glyM-LDH abolished
cytoprotection induced by SUR2A and had a deleterious effect on cell survival
under DNP. The fact that 193glyM-LDH was more efficient in inhibiting SUR2A than
Kir6.2AFA supports our hypothesis that infection of H9C2 cells with AV-SUR2A led
to increased numbers of sarcolemmal KATP channels, increase in
subsarcolemmal ATP and increased K+ current in response to
metabolic stress. An increase in subsarcolemmal ATP following infection with
SUR2A seems to be the major mechanism of SUR2A-mediated cardioprotection. It is
also worthwhile mentioning that cell survival after concomitant infection with
SUR2A and Kir6.2 was not statistically different from those in cells infected
with SUR2A alone. This is compatible with idea that SUR2A level is the rate
limiting factor in regulating numbers of sarcolemmal KATP
channels and cell resistance to metabolic stress.

In conclusion, this study has shown that infection with SUR2A increases
resistance to metabolic stress in H9C2 cells. The mechanism underlying
SUR2A-mediated cytoprotection is associated with increase in number of
sarcolemmal KATP channels, increased K+
current as well as increased production of ATP by the glycolytic enzymes
physically associated with KATP channel subunits.
