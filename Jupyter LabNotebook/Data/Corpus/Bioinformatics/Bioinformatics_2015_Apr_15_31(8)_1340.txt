In the above paper, there were several mistakes due to copyediting error. In Theorem 1 ‘if’ should be replaced by ‘iff’ and should read as follows: For odd k, an RC complete sequence s achieves the lower bound (Proposition 1) iff there exist two edge-disjoint paths with no repeating edges, corresponding to s and RC(s), that together cover all edges of the de Bruijn graph of order k − 1.

In Algorithm 1 ‘although’ should be replaced by ‘while’, and should read as follows:

1. Initially all edges are unmarked, ,

 and , an arbitrary vertex.

2. While  do

3.  .

4.   Pick any starting vertex  from A.

5.   While there exists an unmarked edge 

   outgoing from v do

6.    Append e to F. Prepend RC(e) to R.

7.    Mark e and RC(e).

8.    Set ; .

9.   Remove v from A.

10.   If , add F to ; add R to ;

11. Merge the cycles in  to obtain a single forward path.

  Do the same for .
