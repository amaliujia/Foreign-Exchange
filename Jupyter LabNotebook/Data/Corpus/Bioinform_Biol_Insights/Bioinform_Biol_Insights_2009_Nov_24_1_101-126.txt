Introduction
First used at least as early as the beginning of the 1970s, the concept of “the language of the genes” has become a recurring explanatory tool in popular presentations of molecular genetics (; ). Genomes may be compared to libraries of genetic information, with each chromosome as a book, genes as chapters, and DNA bases as the letters in which the text is written (). In principle, the linguistic analogy may be applied equally to protein sequences as to DNA, simply by increasing the alphabet from 4 to 20 letters. The prevalence, and utility, of this metaphor in undergraduate teaching and the popular science media, obscures a deeper controversy concerning its genuine applicability in research (; ; ; ). Attempts have been made to apply generative grammar structures to gene organization in bacteria (, , ), DNA-protein interaction (; ), the problem of gene prediction (Dong and Searls, 1994; ), protein folding () and RNA structure prediction (). These efforts in molecular biology are in the tradition of wider attempts to create formal grammars, or to use the grammatical metaphor, for other kinds of biological data (; ; ; ). A related metaphor is that of genome sequence as a code to be deciphered by the molecular biologist, who thus becomes a “biomolecular cryptologist” (; ). Conversely, techniques developed in molecular biology are now being recycled back into cryptography ().

Under the terms of these general analogies, short sequences of DNA may be regarded as words. Often, any k-mer is referred to as a word (; ) but here these will be designated strings. Where a string has some local functional significance in a sequence and consequently has been conserved throughout the evolutionary process, it may be referred to as a motif (; ). Identification of motifs is usually based on large-scale comparative analysis and alignment of related sequences.

Counts of DNA string frequency have been used as a means of differentiating classes of DNA sequence, such as exons, introns and promoters (; ; , ; ; ; ), although the meaning of such differences in terms of the linguistic metaphor of the genome has been disputed (; ; ; ). String counts, after correction for underlying base composition, have been assembled into vectors known as genome signatures, reflecting their apparent distinctiveness between genomes (; ; ; ; ). Such composition-corrected string frequency vectors have proved useful in detecting horizontal gene transfer events between species of bacteria (). A further development based on genome signatures is that of compositional spectra, designed to reduce vector size and increase technical tractability (; ).

This paper investigates the meaning of the linguistic metaphor in more detail in protein sequences, with particular emphasis on the identification of words. A protein word, rather than a string, is here taken to be more literally comparable to a word within a text of human origin. Therefore, words are only a subset of strings. Likewise, a word differs from a motif, in that motifs are often fuzzy (meaning tolerant to substitution) and are best viewed in the context of an alignment of related sequences. Within a text of human origin, a word has some context-independence. It has clear boundaries and may appear flanked by very different text in different cases. Fuzziness is also not tolerated; a word has a correct spelling. The total assembly of detected words is referred to as the vocabulary, and the word detection process as vocabulary analysis.

The pioneering vocabulary analysis in DNA sequences was carried out by . Their metric was based on contrasting frequencies of substrings within the candidate word. For a string, s, of length k, its expected occurrence, E, is the product of the occurrences of its left and right substrings, divided by the occurrence of its internal substring.

For each string, s, the difference between its expected occurrence, E(s) as calculated above, and actual occurrence, f(s), is quantified by:
This provides a z-score for the actual occurrence of the string.  define a contrast word as any string where std(s) ≥ 3.  were able to identify several contrast words of lengths k = 3 to 6 in the genomes of E. coli and two coliphages. Conversely, avoided words could also be detected, where std(s) ≤ −3. An essentially similar metric has been implemented by others (, ; ; ; ; ; ).

In principle, this method could also be applied to detect contrast words in protein sequences, but the combinatorial explosion caused by the presence of a 20-letter code in proteins as opposed to the 4-letter code in DNA, has restricted work on string frequency in proteins to k = 2 (i.e. dipeptides) only (). Application of the contrast words method to human texts was extended by . Analysing Alice in Wonderland, they found that it performed relatively poorly, essentially due to the fact that the 26-letter alphabet of a text in English has a string combinatorial explosion problem even worse than that of 20-letter protein sequences.

This paper proposes improvements on the contrast words method, initially comparing their performance, in the tradition of , on Alice in Wonderland. The most accurate method for identifying true words is then applied to several other human texts, to the NRL3D set of proteins of solved structure, and to the proteome sets of several species from all three superkingdoms (NCBI Taxonomy Browser classification) of cellular organisms.

The concept of synonymity is familiar in molecular biology. Within the degenerate genetic code, many amino acids may be encoded by more than one codon. A protein sequence may therefore be potentially coded by a combinatorially vast number of synonymous DNA sequences. Here the term is used in a more general sense. When two protein strings have different sequences, but perform the same function in their respective proteins, they are said to be functionally synonymous. Fuzzy motifs are an example of functional synonymity within protein families. The converse concept, that of homonymity, has not been explored (although see ). Where a non-fuzzy word occurs in two different proteins and performs a different function in each, that peptide word is functionally homonymous. At a trivial level, it is immediately possible to see that the longer a peptide, the less likelihood it has of functional homonymity. The questions of the longest existing homonymous word, the prevalence of peptide homonymity, and its origins are all explored in this paper.

Methods
Texts and protein sequence sources
Public domain texts were downloaded from Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org). Punctuation, non-alphabetic characters, numbers and spaces were removed. Word counts were case-insensitive.

The NRL3D set of sequences of proteins of solved structure () was downloaded from the University of Hong Kong (http://bioinfo.hku.hk/db/nrl_3d/NRL3D/nrl_3d.seq). Non-contiguous sequences (those annotated as “fragments”), sequences containing ambiguities and exact duplicates were removed using a Perl script. This reduces the number of sequences from 23301 to 6168. Further trimmings were performed using CD-HIT (), which can produce datasets with maximum degrees of pairwise identity. Such reduced sets are subsequently referred to as NRL3D_nn, where nn is the maximum pairwise identity. The justification for this trimming is that most words will occur in closely related sequences, and will consequently be explicable at a trivial level. Trimming with CD-HIT reduces the number of words detected and maximises the likelihood that they will be found in less closely related proteins, and thereby be potentially more interesting from a functional point of view. As a negative control, trimmed NRL3D data sets were shuffled using shuffleseq (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/4.0/emboss/apps/shuffleseq.html) from EMBOSS ().

Proteomes (meaning predicted protein sets derived from genome projects) were downloaded from the EBI Integr8 database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/integr8). They were similarly reduced by CD-HIT.

Vocabulary analysis algorithms
For each text or proteome, and for NRL3D, overlapping strings of all lengths from k = 1 to 20 were counted using a Perl script running the BioPerl () SeqWords module (http://doc.bioperl.org/releases/bioperl-current/bioperl-live/Bio/Tools/SeqWords.html). The SeqWords output was then analysed in the following ways. Each metric is given an acronym for easier reference.

CW: Contrast words method (see Introduction)
This is the method of . The difference is that the std(s) threshold was set at 0.1 to maximise the number of candidate words.

RS: Raw strings
The simplest possible method: all strings of length k ≥ 5, occurring at n ≥ 20, were assessed as candidate words.

ES: Equal substrings
The raw strings extracted as above were trimmed to include only those having equal occurrences of left and right substrings.
The rationale for this approach is that many true words tend to satisfy this criterion. For instance, in Alice in Wonderland, the true word ALICE is revealed by:
following to the fact that Alice in Wonderland, despite referring to several species, does not mention lice.

CW-ESM: Equal substrings of middle substring of contrast words
Combining methods 1 and 3, middle substrings were extracted from contrast words with std(s) &gt; = 0.1. These were then examined for equal substrings:
The rationale for this approach is the ad hoc empirical observation that false positive contrast words, of which there are many (), frequently have true words embedded within them as middle substrings.

RS-ESM: Equal substrings of middle substring of raw strings
Combining methods 2 and 3, since equality of substrings within the middle strings of contrast words was frequently found to be an indicator of a true word, the same was applied to raw strings. The additional proviso was that the left and right substrings of the raw string were not of equal occurrence to each other or the middle substring.
The rationale for this was that, for instance, within the raw string DALICET, the true word ALICE is revealed by:
CW-ESM and RS-ESM are equivalent, excepting that CW-ESM takes contrast words as its starting point, and RS-ESM uses raw strings. In both cases the candidate word is the middle substring, should it satisfy the criteria given.

Measurement of accuracy
In human texts it is possible to score true words among the detected candidate words. Accuracy is measured using the Sen2 statistic ():
where TP are those candidate words identified as true positives, and FP are those identified as false positives.

Perl scripts are available on request from the author.

Assessment of hits
Protein domains were determined by reference to Pfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam—) and Prosite motifs detected using ScanProsite (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/scan-prosite—). Alignments were performed using ClustalW () or bl2seq (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi—).

Structural visualization
Solved proteins structures were downloaded from PDB (http://www.pdb.org) and visualization was carried out in MOE (http://www.chemcomp.com).

Results
Vocabulary analysis in human texts
Alice in Wonderland is a short novel of 26587 words. The total vocabulary is 2593 different words, of which 1475 are used more than once and 1072 more than twice. For illustrative purposes, the 10 commonest words are shown in . As might be expected, these are all small prepositions and pronouns, except for the name “Alice” which has 386 occurrences and is the 10th commonest word, and the verb past tense “said” at 462 occurrences.

The words in  are derived from a spaced text, with only punctuation and other extraneous characters removed. Spaces were then removed for testing of the various metrics. Again for illustrative purposes the top 10 hits using each method are shown ( to ), but the final comparison was made using all the hits for each method ().

RS metric
The commonest raw strings in Alice in Wonderland of length k = 5 to 20 are tabulated in . Only 3 of the commonest raw strings in  are true discrete words or phrases (DWoPs—shaded grey). “Alice” as a raw string has a slightly higher occurrence than the word “Alice” in a spaced text (397 vs. 386—see ) as it also occurs as part of the possessive “Alice’s”. As  suggests, RS is a relatively poor metric for identifying true words. Almost all of the raw strings in  are components of the single DWoP “said the”.

CW metric
CW () performs equally poorly, as previously demonstrated by .  shows the top 10 contrast words of length k = 7 to 20, sorted by descending std(s). There are only two DWoPs detected.

It was noted that the some of the false positive contrast words in  contained the true DWoPs “of the” (twice), “in the” and “little” as their middle substrings. This stimulated the further investigation of the middle subwords.

ES metric
 tabulates the 10 highest hits with ES, sorted by their occurrence, n. This contains 6 true DWoPs (shaded).

ES performs rather better than CW or RS, although it can accumulate nested strings. For instance in , “saidalic” is found to be a substring of “saidalice”, “littl” of “little” and “heking” of “theking”. This suggested the combination of ES with the other methods.

RS-ESM metric
RS-ESM shows a further marked improvement. Nested substrings are avoided, and 9 out of the top 10 hits are true positives ().

CW-ESM
CW-ESM appears to be the best method on first examination. All of the top 10 hits are true DWoPs (). However, a decision on the best method to apply to biological sequences requires a fuller assessment of the output beyond the top 10 hits.

Comparison of methods
 compares the methods on Alice in Wonderland. Since the initial string count was to k = 20, the two ESM methods are limited to k = 18 as their longest identifiable word.

 demonstrates that the CW metric is the poorest. Although it generates a large number of hits, the true positive rate is barely more than 6%. RS gives greater numbers of candidate words as the thresholds for occurrence and string length are dropped, but Sen2 does not rise above 24%. Adding a requirement for equal right and left substrings, ES, brings the number of candidates down dramatically—from 1213 hits to 241 hits where k = 5–20, n ≥ 0. Sen2 increases from 17% to just over 25%. However, for the combination methods, Sen2 increases considerably. For contrast words (CW-ESM) just under 58% accuracy can be achieved, and just over 68% accuracy for raw strings (RS-ESM). The latter also has a larger number of hits, generating 895 true positives. Considering only 1042 words are used more than twice in Alice in Wonderland, this is a reasonable figure.

The next question to be investigated is whether or not the quality of hits varies across k.  plots the true positive rate against the length of the candidate word for RS-ESM in Alice in Wonderland. Sen2 increases with length k. Although the overall Sen2 is 0.682 (), Sen2 rises above 0.8 for k = 11–15. The majority of strings of length k = 4 and 5 are false positives.

Extending the analysis to a range of other human texts,  plots the number of candidate DWoPs detected for each against the length of the text in 1000s of characters (kchar). There is a clear correlation (r = 0.994) between number of different words and size of text. This has also been observed for the number of different raw strings, a phenomenon known as Heaps’ Law ().

Vocabulary analysis in sets of real and shuffled protein sequences
 suggests that there may be increased artefactual detection of false positive DWoPs for RS-ESM at k = 4 and 5, based on the identification of such false positives in Alice in Wonderland. Greater than 60% true positivity is only obtained at k ≥ 7 and 80% at k ≥ 11. When a text of human origin is being analysed, one can reliably identify the false positives and thus precisely quantify Sen2. However, in a protein sequence set, whether NRL3D or a naturally occurring proteome, scoring of accuracy requires the use of shuffled sequences. In the shuffled sequences, all hits are by definition artefactual.  plots the distribution of candidate words in real and shuffled NRL3D_63 protein sequence set (see Methods) for both RS-ESM and CW-ESM methods. It can be seen that the shuffled sequence sets give false positives at up to k = 6 for RS-ESM. However, the ratio of hits of k = 6 in the real as compared to the shuffled genome is much higher than at k = 5 or less. Therefore, it seems that k = 6 should be considered an ambiguous category. Although most hits at k = 6 are likely to be genuine, there is a far greater risk of a false positive than at k ≥ 7. The observation that Sen2 is less than 0.5 for k ≤ 5 () also justifies concentration on longer candidate words. This supports the earlier finding by , who found that matches of 6 residues within a window of length 10, could be found far more frequently between pairs of real proteins than random sequences. By contrast, CW-ESM, although producing fewer hits, has no hits in shuffled sequences above k = 5. Therefore, it might be preferred for investigating words of length k = 6.

Structural meaning of words
The words of k = 12–18 identified in NRL3D_63 using RS-ESM are shown in .

The protein family in which the word is located is designated from the NRL3D annotation, or where that is ambiguous, by reference to Pfam (). Most of these hits are found within fairly well conserved proteins, often orthologues having the same essential function in different species within the same major phylogenetic class. In some cases, however, the hits are found to be stretches of total conservation within otherwise somewhat divergent proteins, often having slightly variant functions and from rather more distant species. The 14-mer LGGTCVNVGCVPKK is found in glutathione reductase (EC 1.6.4.2) from humans and E. coli, and in the related enzyme trypanothione reductase (EC 1.6.4.8) from two genera of trypanosome.

Although LGGTCVNVGCVPKK is completely conserved within an alignment having generally poor levels of conservation (), spanning bacteria, trypanosomes and humans, all these proteins possess a pyridine nucleotide-disulphide oxidoreductase domain (Pfam PF07992). LG-GTCVNVGCVPKK is also recognised by Scan-Prosite () as containing a pyridine_redox_1 motif (ProSite PS00076). The word therefore may be taken to have equivalent function within these proteins and is not a homonym as defined in the Introduction. LGGTCVN-VGCVPKK in all four cases is found at the beginning of a long helix. Superposition of the structures of the 4 proteins to 1.894 Å in MOE demonstrates excellent conservation even over the poorly conserved regions. LGGTCVNVGCVPKK assumes a highly similar structure in all cases ().

As an additional example, AFLGIPFAEPPVG is found in the N-terminal regions of acetylcholin-esterase (EC 3.1.1.7) from mouse and the electric ray and also in triacylglycerol lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) from yeast. As before, the word represents a stretch of total conservation in an otherwise low identity alignment (). Despite this, all 3 of these proteins contain a carboxylesterase domain (Pfam PF00135), and their solved structures may be superposed over their full length to 3.70 Å in MOE (not shown).

One phenomenon that appears in the output, that has no analogue in texts of human origin, is the detection of homopolymers. The longest homopolymeric word in NRL3D_63 is the heptamer AAAAAAA, detected in antifreeze protein A from the flounder and also in an amine dehydrogenase from Thiobacillus versutus. However, it occurs in the extreme C-terminus and N-terminus respectively of these two proteins. Homopolymers are a consequence of regions of low complexity within coding DNA, and have no analogue within human texts. They formally constitute words, and indeed in the case of AAAAAAA a homonym, within the terms of the algorithms used, but are neglected owing to their lack of likely functional significance.

Leaving aside the homopolymers, there is only one identifiable homonym in NRL3D_63 of k ≥ 7. SLGDRVT is found in a beta-lactamase from Streptomyces albus and also in two mouse antibody proteins (1JRHL and 1NMCL). The two mouse proteins are 61% identical as assessed by bl2seq (), and SLGDRVT is found in both cases in the N-terminus of the solved structure of the protein, where it is part of the V-set domain (Pfam PF07686) The two mouse proteins superpose to 0.821 Å over the entire length of their solved structures (not shown), and their SLGDRVT sequences have good structural alignment of their backbones ().

In the eubacterial lactamase 1BSG, SLGDRVT is found in a different conformation (). In this protein is it part of a helix rich beta-lactamase domain, but does not occur within a helix.

SLGDRVT is the only homonym detectable in NRL3D_63 at k = 7 using RS-ESM. Although there are many at k = 6 (37 with CW-ESM and 36 with RS-ESM). As shown in , CW-ESM may be preferable to RS-ESM at k = 6 in that, although less sensitive, it is less inclined to false positives at k = 6.

In summary, within NRL3D_63, longer words are mostly indicative of conservation. Some of them are islands of ultra-conservation within distinctly divergent proteins. However, annotation or Pfam domain mapping indicates that these are always, at least in the cases examined (both above and data not shown), within proteins of similar general functionality. The longest homomym is a solitary example found at k = 7 but they appear to be plentiful at k = 6. The latter however, must be under suspicion of false positivity, owing to the number of hits at k = 6 in shuffled versions of the NRL3D database. The relative paucity of homonyms of reliable length suggests that future fine-tuning of the algorithm ought to be performed on protein sequence sets where functional annotation of motifs and domains is more complete than in NRL3D.

Since NRL3D is a compendium of proteins of highly diverse origin, but also enriched for sequences of easily solved structure, its vocabulary may be very different in character to that of individual proteomes. These were therefore examined for the presence of homonyms and island of extreme conservation.

Vocabulary analysis on individual proteomes
 plots the number of words detected using RS-ESM versus the size of the proteome in terms of number of proteins. All proteomes were previously reduced to no more than 63% identity by use of CD-HIT, as performed on NLR3D.  indicates that Heaps’ Law (see  above) also applies to proteomes. This had previously been observed for raw strings in proteins (). The same trend applies when the proteomes are measured in kilo-residues (comparison not shown).

 shows the same general relationship for proteomes as is demonstrated in  for texts. The correlation is weaker for eukaryotes (not shown in ) and archaea (r = 0.905 and 0.907 respectively), but comparable for eubacteria (r = 0.996 against r = 0.994 for texts). However, the range of proteome size in eukaryotes is generally not comparable with the other two superkingdoms, making it difficult to draw any conclusions concerning differences in vocabulary structure between super-kingdoms. Supplementary Material ,  and  give the full results for the various species.

 shows that texts of human origin have a far richer vocabulary than proteomes, and that eukaryotes appear to have a richer vocabulary than eubacteria or archaea. However, when only eukaryotic proteomes within the size range of the other two kingdoms are considered, this discrepancy decreases markedly, suggesting that it should be interpreted with caution.

Detailed analysis of all proteome sets would be inappropriate for a single paper. A number of individual proteomes were chosen for further analysis, contrasting the three superkingdoms, and also small and large proteomes where possible.

Vocabulary analysis in a small eubacterial proteome
Chlamydia muridarum has 916 proteins, of which 914 are no more than 63% identical, indicating a virtual absence of gene families of closely related proteins. Using RS-ESM, C. muridarum contains 34 words of which 17 are k ≥ 7 (Supplementary Material ). One of these is the homoheptamer DDDDDDD, and 7 others are words that occur several times within single proteins, indicating repetitive sequences, or occurring in low complexity areas of proteins. Of the remainder, all fall within clearly related proteins, except for two. The first of these, GPTGSGK appears at first glance to constitute a homonym, occurring in 4 proteins (SwissProt identifiers Q9PLF7, Q9PLM1, Q9PJG9 and Q9PKD0) with different Pfam domains, although all are ATP-binding proteins. In each case GPTGSGK is found at or near the N-terminus of the main Pfam domain within the protein (being IPPT, AAA_2, GSPII_E and ABC_tran respectively, listed as “various” in Supplementary Material ). In the case of Q9PKD0, GPTGSGK is annotated by ScanProsite as an NP_BIND ATP binding motif. Therefore, GPTGSGK is probably not a homonym but rather an ATP-binding cassette conserved or convergently evolved across divergent proteins within C. muridarum.

A second word of interest is an ultra-conserved region within a set of rather divergent transporter proteins, where it constitutes, again like GPTGSGK, the NP_BIND motif for ATP-binding (). GPNGAGKSTL and GPTGSGK can be represented by the profile GP(T/N)G(A/S)GK.

Of the 17 words in C. muridarum of k = 6, all but 4 appear to be homonyms. However, these must be regarded with suspicion, as they can occur artefactually at k = 6 in shuffled sequences (). When C. muridarum is examined with the less sensitive CW-ESM algorithm, which is also less liable to artefactual hits at k = 6, there are only 6 hits at that length, of which only one is a homonym.

Vocabulary analysis in a large archaeal proteome
Methanosarcina acetivorans has 4467 proteins, of which 4080 are no more than 63% identical, indicating that around 10% of the total is comprised of members of moderately or closely related protein families, in contrast to the virtual absence of such families in C. muridarum. In order to make the analysis more tractable, the M. acetivorans proteome is first trimmed to 40% maximum identity, reducing it to 3655 proteins. Using RS-ESM, M. acetivorans contains 946 words or which 659 are k ≥ 7 and 300 are k ≥ 10. Those satisfying both k ≥ 10 and n ≥ 9 are shown in Supplementary Material .

The words mostly represent islands of extreme conservation within what are fairly divergent families. For instance the 17-mer HHRIKNNLQ-VISSLLDL is found in histidine kinases (), where its location corresponds to the start of the HisKA_2 domain (Pfam PF07568). There do not appear to be any homonymous words of k ≥ 10 in the M. acetivorans proteome. M. acetivorans words are dominated by the preponderance of components of histidine kinase domains and PKD domains (Pfam PF00801).

Vocabulary analysis in a medium-sized eukaryotic proteome
The fungus Yarrowia lipolytica has 6524 proteins of which 5864 are &lt;40% identical. It therefore has almost exactly the same overall proportion (just under 90%) of proteins in gene families as M. acetivorans. Using RS-ESM, Y. lipolytica contains 1954 words of which 940 are k ≥ 7 and 401 are k ≥ 10. All words satisfying both k ≥ 10 and n ≥ 9 are shown in Supplementary Material . By contrast with M. acetivorans, the prominent Y. lipolytica words are composed entirely of simple sequence repeats.

Vocabulary analysis in a large eukaryotic proteome
Brachydanio rerio, the zebrafish, has 14049 proteins, of which 8312 are no more than 40% identical, indicating that just over 40% of the total are members of moderately or closely related protein families, a considerably higher proportion than in the smaller eukaryotic proteomes (at ~10% for Y. lipolytica). Using RS-ESM, B. rerio contains 2938 words or which 1380 are k ≥ 7 and 452 are k ≥ 10. All words satisfying both k ≥ 10 and n ≥ 9 are shown in Supplementary Material .

Just as prominent M. acetivorans words are dominated by components of histidine kinase domains and PKD domains, prominent B. rerio words are in most cases part of an EGF domain, with a handful of SCRC domains (PF00530). There are also several examples of low complexity words (Supplementary Material ), similar to Y. lipoloytica.

Discussion
An improved algorithm for vocabulary analysis in texts of human origin, has been applied to proteomes. In its two variants, CW-ESM and RS-ESM, it achieves an accuracy of 60%–70% () and in the case of RS-RSM has approximately 85% sensitivity. This sensitivity estimate is based on 895 true positive hits as compared to the 1042 words used more than twice in Alice in Wonderland. It remains an approximation as the algorithm detects phrases longer than single words (DWoPs, see –). Although CW-ESM is slightly less accurate than RS-ESM and less than half as sensitive (), it is less liable to false positives at k = 6 (). Since many protein homonyms appear at k = 6, CW-ESM remains an important accessory algorithm for the study of short words in protein sequences. This paper therefore solves the problem posed by  of how to apply the method of  to longer alphabets. Since the combinatorial explosion problem is greater in human texts than in protein sequences, the adequacy of the algorithm for detecting words in texts implies that it can do the same for proteins, should such words exist.

It is notable that the words detected by the algorithm follow Heaps’ Law, a linear increase in word count as text size increases, for both human texts () and proteins (). A similar result for raw strings in proteins is already known (). Within superkingdoms, Heaps’ Law correlations are strongest for human texts and eubacterial proteomes. By contrast, between superkingdoms, eukaryotic proteomes appear to be nearly three times more word-rich on average than the two prokaryotic superkingdoms. However, caution must be exercised in inter-superkingdom comparisons as the average proteome size is almost four times larger for eukaryotes. When only small eukaryote proteomes are used, the proportionately larger number of words decreases to similar levels (). Heaps’ Law therefore appears to deviate from linearity in large eukaryotic proteomes, but eukaryotic proteomes may still be comparable to prokaryotic proteomes at smaller sizes. One possible explanation for this is that larger eukaryotic proteomes are richer in gene families, adding an extra source of words to the general trend implied by Heaps’ Law, and supported by the observation that about 40% of B. rerio proteins are &gt;40% identical.

It should be noted that vocabulary analysis is not the same as segmentation (; ), when a text known to be composed of words is split into candidate words. Segmentation is often used in computer analysis of pictographic languages such as Japanese kanji script, where word boundaries are unclear. By contrast, vocabulary analysis algorithms search for the presence of candidate word structures in bodies of symbols that may not necessarily contain them.

The fact that human texts are an order of magnitude more enriched in words than proteomes (), suggests that the linguistic analogy for biological sequences remains a weak one, and furthermore that segmentation algorithms, relying as they do on complete decomposition of the text into words, are unlikely to be applicable to protein sequences. Nevertheless, the presence of identifiable word-like structures within proteomes is intriguing. Shuffled proteomes, like shuffled texts, lose their word content. Within a shuffled proteome, false positives are rare and in neither RS-ESM nor CW-ESM are found at k ≥ 7. Words of k = 6 are ambiguous, as they are generated as false positives by RS-ESM (). By analogy with words in human texts, proteome words are suggested to be sequences that are intolerant to mutation but are nevertheless relatively context-independent in their function.

Analysis of the distribution of words in individual proteomes demonstrates two main categories:
conserved stretches within proteins of essentially similar function (see –).

homonyms appearing in proteins of demonstrably different functions (see ).



Conserved words can be further split into:
relatively uninteresting sequence identities within closely related proteins

ultra-conserved words in rather more divergent proteins (see , , ,  and  for examples).

Homonyms are plentiful but short, rarely k &gt; 6, whereas ultra-conserved stretches are often much longer, for instance the 17-mer HHRIKNNLQ-VISSLLDL (Supplementary Material  and ) which forms a word in a family of histidine kinase proteins in M. acetivorans. Only words of up to k = 18 were tested in this paper, so no estimate can be made of the longest existing word. M. acetivorans has a low complexity 18-mer, STDDSTDDSTDDSTDDST (Supplementary Material ), and Y. lipolytica has eight (Supplementary Material ). The longest high complexity words are the 6 EGF domain words and a zinc finger word found in B. rerio (Supplementary Material ).

Not all words can be easily designated as homonyms or conserved. For instance, in C. muridarum GPTGSGK is found in different Pfam domains in different proteins (IPPT, AAA_2, GSPII_E and ABC_tran), initially suggesting homonymity. However, in all these cases GPTGSGK forms part of an ATP-binding cassette. Whether this is best explained by ultra-conservation within highly divergent ATP-binding proteins with a distant GPTGSGK-containing ancestor or by the multiple evolution of ATP binding capacities by convergence to these words, is debatable. The similar longer word GPNGAGKSTL () is also an ATP-binding element, but, unlike GPTGSGK, GPNGAGKSTL is always found in the ABC_tran domain (PF00005), and therefore is more likely to be an example of ultra-conservation than convergence.

Homonyms are assumed to have different functions within their respective proteins, especially when they can be shown to have different structures (e.g. see ). However, apparent homonyms with similar structures may be a result of convergent molecular evolution on a micro-scale, perhaps the case with C. muridarum GPTGSGK. For a specific structural example, VLVIGA is a 6-mer homonym in NRL3D, occurring in: 1BFD, a benzoylformate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.7) from Pseudomonas putida; 1AD3A, an aldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.5) from rat; and in 1D4OA, a bovine NADPH transhydrogenase (EC 1.6.1.1). In each of these cases VLVIGA is found in a different Pfam domain: in TPP_enz_M (PF00295), Aldedh (PF00171) and PNTB (PF02233) respectively. Nevertheless, the conformation of VLVIGA is remarkable similar in each case, always being the point at which a short beta-sheet ends ().

Comparison of different proteomes indicates that the peptide vocabularies can be quite different in character from species to species. For instance, the prominent words in the small eubacterial species C. muridarum are dominated by components of adherence factor proteins mixed with a handful of peptides from other domains and some low complexity elements (Supplementary Material ). The large archaeon M. acetivorans has many words from PKD and histidine kinase domains (Supplementary Material ). The fungus Y. lipolytica has only low complexity words within its major vocabulary (Supplementary Material ). Finally, the vertebrate B. rerio is dominated by EGF domain words (Supplementary Material ). A fuller exploration of how typical these vocabulary patterns may be, is beyond the scope of the present paper. However, it indicates that each proteome may potentially be identifiable by the characteristics of its vocabulary; e.g. rich in low complexity, or with certain typical domain-linked vocabularies, raising the prospect of a peptide vocabulary signature analogous to the genome signature found in DNA. This may be useful in metagenomic analysis.

, in pairwise comparisons of proteins, found many matches of 6 residues within windows of 10, and showed that these occurred far less frequently between pairs of random proteins. The method of , differs from the one presented here in that they used a criterion of 60% identity with strings of k = 10. Unlike the present method, there was no previous algorithmic identification of candidate words by statistical properties. Rather, they commenced with a small group of proteins and extracted all their initial 10-mer strings from those sequences. These were then compared against the whole protein database, and matches of 6/10 or better recorded. It thus has some similarities to method RS above, but incorporating fuzziness. Regardless of these methodological incongruences, the detection by  of a far greater quantity of short common strings in real protein pairs than in shuffled ones, parallels the results presented in . Therefore, it is justifiable to believe that even words of k = 6 may be mostly due to something other than random coincidence. The nature of this pressure may be conservation, amply demonstrated by the various ultra-conserved words within fairly divergent proteins (, ,  and ) or it may be convergent evolution. The latter of these raises the possibility than the presence of an apparent homonym within a protein may imply positive selection within the family to which that protein belongs, and which may be detectable using appropriate methods (; ). For instance, if a candidate homonymic word is found in two proteins of differing function, for instance different Pfam families, and positive selection can be statistically demonstrated in each of those families over the region of the homonym, a selective convergent scenario for the origin of that homonym would be highly suggestive.

Summary of RS-ESM results on human texts and phylogenetic kingdoms. “euk. (eub. range)” refers to the eukaryotic proteomes that are within the same size range (in kilo-residues) as the eubacterial proteomes. Likewise, “euk. (arc. range)” refers to those within the same size range as the archaeal proteomes. For the human texts, “number of species” refers to number of texts, and average proteome size to average text size (in kilo-characters).
