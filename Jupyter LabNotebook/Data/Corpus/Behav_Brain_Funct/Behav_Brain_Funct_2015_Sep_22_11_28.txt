High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was observed to be an important extracellular mediator involved in vascular inflammation associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This study is of interest to examine the efficacy of 4′-O-β-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol (4OGOMV), C22H28O10, on the alternation of cytokines and HMGB1 in an animal model.

Methods
A rodent double hemorrhage SAH model was employed. Administration with 4OGOMV was initiated 1 h after animals were subjected to SAH. Basilar arteries (BAs) were harvested and cortexes examined for HMGB1 mRNA, protein expression (Western blot) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) immunostaining. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected to examine IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 (rt-PCR).

Results
Morphological findings revealed endothelial cell deformity, intravascular elastic lamina torture, and smooth muscle necrosis in the vessels of SAH groups. Correspondently, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 in the SAH-only and SAH-plus vehicle groups was also elevated. 4OGOMV dose-dependently reduced HMGB1 protein expression when compared with the SAH groups.(p &lt; 0.01) Likewise, 400 μg/kg 4OGOMV reduced IL-1β, MCP-1 and HMGB1 mRNA levels as well as MCP-1(+) monocytes when compared with the SAH groups..

Conclusion
4OGOMV exerts its neuro-protective effect partly through the dual effect of inhibiting IL-6 and MCP-1 activation and also reduced HMGB1 protein, mRNA and MCP-1(+) leukocytes translocation. This study lends credence to validating 4OGOMV as able to attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA, late-onset inflammasome, and cellular basis in SAH-induced vasospasm.

Background
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cerebral vasospasm persists as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from aneurysm rupture [1–7]. Owing to lack of effective therapies to amend this condition, the precise mechanisms of this disease content need further investigation. An ongoing body of research summarizes two major hypotheses: one is focused on the immediate role of endothelins/nitric oxide [8] and another on SAH-induced oxidative stress and a series of inflammatory reaction in the development and maintenance of vasoconstriction [9–16]. As we know in the condition of SAH, oxy-hemolysate will culminate a cascade of cellular and molecular events in the subarachnoid space and further result in a robust inflammatory response [2, 3]. Even if the systemic inflammation has been recognized in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm, the putative importance of intracranial sterile inflammatory activity has not been fully emphasized. Till now, various inflammosomes, including adhesion molecules, cytokines, leukocytes, immunoglobulins, and complements, were observed in the pathogenesis of SAH-induced cerebral infarct and vasospasm [1, 7, 8, 17–20].

The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecule have been found increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after SAH [10, 15]. However, the benefits of inflammation associated with SAH remain unclear. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ubiquitous nuclear protein, is expressed in activated monocytes, macrophages, circulating neutrophils, and platelets [13, 17, 21]. In Wolfson et al’s study, HMGB1 is proved to be able to mediate vascular monocyte chemotaxis, neuron dendrite outgrowth, and the proinflammatory reaction of endothelial cells [16]. The released HMGB1 is late-onset to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) kinetically. Park et al. [22] also demonstrated HMGB1, through binding glycation end products (RAGE) and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 receptors, was able to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK 2. As a late mediator, HMGB1 is able to induce the expression of vascular cell-adhesion molecule (VCAM), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), and E-selectin, and lead to up-regulating the recruitment of leukocytes [21, 23, 24]. It is rational to postulate that HMGB1 can mediate cerebral inflammation and play a putative role in SAH-induced delayed vasoconstriction.

4′-O-β-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol (4OGOMV) is one of the four active components extracted from Saposhnikovia divaricata, which has been widely used in the treatment of headache, generalized aches and pains, inflammation and cancer in the Orient for centuries [25–29]. 4OGOMV has been reported to be able to suppress histone H3 phosphorylation and make it able to abrogate the mitotic cell cycle progression and immediate pro-inflammatory gene expression in the HeLa S-3 cell culture [30]. Increasing evidence demonstrates that histone phosphorylation at Ser10 plays a critic role in cellular mitotic progression and induces immediate pro-inflammatory genes during the interphase [31]. Like other histone deacetylase inhibitors, via targeting on the regulation of histone proteins and the regulation of α-tubulin acetylation, recent studies on histone deacetylase were focused on the pathogenesis of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease [4, 32].

Given the promising result of 4OGOMV on the block of cellular mitosis and its various effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulation on endothelial dysfunction, the rat SAH model was used to test the hypothesis that 4OGOMV, a natural histone deacetylase inhibitor, attenuates SAH-related vasospasm and HMGB1-associated neuro-inflammation.

Methods
Materials
4′-O-β-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol (4OGOMV) has been characterized as a naturally occurring and potent histone H3 phosphorylation inhibitor, and was bought from Baoji Plant Bio-Engineering Co.,Ltd., Shaanxi 710000-710090 PRC. Monoclonal anti-rat IL1-β, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 antibody were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA 02139, USA), BD Transduction Lab (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA 95060, USA), Upstate Biotech (Lake placid, NY 12946, USA), and Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA 95060, USA). Rabbit anti-rat HMBG1 antibody was purchased from Biochiefdom international Co., Ltd, Taipei 11659, Taiwan distributing Abchem biochemicals, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA CNM protein extraction kits were from Biochain (Hayward, CA 94545, USA). 4OGOMV was prepared by Ms. Wu SC (Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung 807. Taiwan, ROC). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM was used as a solvent as well as a vehicle.

Induction of double hemorrhage SAH
Fifty-four male Sprague–Dawley rats (260–320 g; bought from BioLasco Taiwan Co., Ltd., Taipei 115, Taiwan. authorized by Charles River Lab), were enclosed in this study. All the protocols were approved and supervised by the University of Kaohsiung Medicine Animal Research Committee and were compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki (1964). The rats received anesthesia by an intraperitoneal injection of 7 mg/kg Zoletil 50 (VIRBAC, L.I.D., Carros 06516, France). 0.3 ml fresh arterial blood was withdrawn and injected into the cisterna magna via a stereotactic apparatus (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL 60191, USA) [33, 34]. 0.1 ml Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drawn by No30 Terumo needle to make sure the tip of the needle had been into subarachnoid space. Animals were placed in ventral recumbent position for 20 min to allow clot formation. After monitoring for respiratory distress and giving mechanical ventilation if needed, the animals were returned to the vivarium when fully awake. A habitat with a 12 h light–dark cycle was offered with access to food and water ad labium. 48 h after 1st SAH, the animals received secondary injection of SAH to maintain the tendency of vasoconstriction. Thereafter, the animals received perfusion–fixation 72 h after 2nd SAH.

General design of experimental groups
The animals were randomly subdivided into the following groups (N = 9 rats): (1) sham operated (no SAH); (2) SAH-only; (3) SAH-plus vehicle; (4) 4OGOMV (100 μg/kg/day) treatment in SAH rats; (5) SAH rats received 200 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV treatment; and (6) treatment with 400 μg/kg 4OGOMV in SAH rats. The dosage was adjusted to be devoid of hepatic-renal toxicity based on the pilot rabbit artery ring study. The administration was initialized at 1 h after induction of SAH by using an osmotic mini-pump (Alzet corp, Palo Alto, CA 94301, US) to offer a constant serum level. Cortical tissue samples were obtained by inserting a 24-gauge needle 5 mm into the skull bone (N = 5) through a burr hole craniectomy (2 mm apart from the bregma) under a negative pressure.

Perfusion–fixation
By 72 h after 2nd SAH, the animals were re-anesthetized by administration of 7 mg/kg Zoletil 50. Perfusion–fixation was performed to open the chest, catheterize with a NO16 needle into the left ventricle as well as the clamped descending aorta, and incise the right atrium. 100 ml of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at a pressure of 80 mmHg was dripped, followed by 120 ml 2 % paraformaldehyde in the PBS solution at 36 °C. The brain was extracted and immersed in a fixative at 4 °C overnight. Visual inspection observed blood clots formed over the basilar artery (BA) in all SAH animals.

Hemodynamic measurements
Heart rate, blood pressure, and rectal temperature were monitored in the duration of the administration of 4OGOMV as well as at intervals of 12 h by a tail-cuff method (SC1000 Single Channel System, Hatteras Instruments, NC 27518, US) and rectal thermometer (BIO-BRET-2-ISO. FL 33780, US). The femoral artery was catheterized to obtain blood samples to determine arterial blood gas, Na+, K+, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

Neurological assessment
Two neurological tests were enclosed in this study. A modified limb-placing test (MLPT) [35] was performed before and at a 48 h interval after the animals were subjected to SAH. The behavioral assessment was composed of forelimb and hindlimb ambulation and placing/stepping reflex examinations performed before and after animals were subjected to SAH. A motor deficit index (MDI) was calculated for each rat at an interval of 24 h. The final index was the sum of the scores (walking with lower extremities and placing/stepping reflex). Animals with MDI score more than three were considered as paraplegia, whereas MDI score less than three was considered as neurological deficit. Another modified Voetsch neuro-score was performed, which is composed of the evaluation of head movement, confrontation, reflex stimulated by ear pinch, proprioception and four limbs movement. The summation of neuroscore ranged from 30 to 0, which stood for normal performance to comatose status and paraplegia [36]. The neuroscore was represented as the percentage difference of the mean performance from sham-operated groups.

Basilar artery morphologic studies
Five BA cross-sections of each animal (the middle third) were analyzed by two investigators blinded to the experiment set. The basilar arteries were frozen and cut into 25-μm-thick sections with the assistance of ultra-microtome E (Leica EM UC7, Union Optical and Instruments and Nanotechnology. New Taipei City, 22101 Taiwan.) The cross-sectional area of BA was automatically evaluated via a computer-assisted morphometer (Image-1/Metamorph Imaging System; Universal Imaging Corp. Sunnyvale, CA 94089, USA). The mean average of five cross-sections of a given animal was collected for every animal. Group data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation.

Quantification of mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1
The CSF cytokines mRNA was examined via the ABI PRISM® 7900 System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA 94404, USA). According to the manufacturer’s instructions, the mRNAs for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 expression were determined, while 18S was used as a standard control based on its stability. Primer sequences were employed for IL-1β: (242 bp: forward 5′-GCTCATCTGGGATCCTCTCC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCTGCCTGAAGCTCTTGTTG-3′); IL-6: (91 bp: forward 5′-GACAACTTTGGCATTGTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-ATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3′); IL-8: (229 bp: forward 5′-TCTGCAGCTCTGTGTGAAGG-3′ and reverse 5′-ACTTCTCCACAACCCTCTGC-3′) and MCP-1: (457 bp: forward 5′-CTCTTCCTCCACCACTATGC-3′ and reverse 5′-CTCTGTCATACTGGTCACTTC-3′). Each sample was launched into a TaqM Each sample was launched into a TaqMan® Human Cytokine Card that enclosed probes and primers for specific targets. This procedure was performed via an affixed filling reservoir and a vacuum-loading process via the ABI PRISM® Card Filling Station. Final data were expressed as a relative fold from the baseline. Comparative mRNA expression was set by the Livak and Schmittgen ∆CT method [38]. The results were analyzed if a fivefold increase in the mRNA levels compared with the baseline to allow for data consistency.

HMGB1 protein analyzed by western blotting
The cortical homogenates (20 μg) were stirred with LDS sample buffer (contains 40 % glycerol, 4 % lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS), 0.8 M triethanolamine-Cl pH 7.6, 4 % Ficoll®-400, 0.025 % phenol red, 0.025 % Coomassie G250, 2 mM EDTA disodium, NuPAGE® LDS Sample Buffer (4×) NP0007; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA 92008, USA). Samples were loaded for 8 % sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then separated after centrifuging at 12,000 rpm for 10 min twice. The specimen was then mounted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated in blocking buffer (5 % non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2 % Tween 20) at room temperature. Rabbit anti-rat HMGB1 monoclonal antibody (1:50,000; Biochiefdom International Co., Ltd Wenshen District, Taipei 11659, Taiwan. distributing Abcam biochemicals, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA) was used, while β-Actin (monoclonal anti-β-actin, dilution 1:40,000; Sigma-Aldrich, Taipei 116, Taiwan) was used as a loading control. A secondary antibody was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in TBS-t at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoblots were developed via a GS-700 digital scan and Molecular Analyst® (a GS-700 digital densitometer, GMI, Ramsey, MN 55303, USA). Relative optical densities were obtained by comparison between the measured values and the mean values from the vehicle plus SAH groups.

Detection of HMGB1 mRNA by rt-PCR
The activated HMGB1 mRNA levels in the cortical homogenates were determined by TriPure RT-PCR Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp. IN 46256, USA). As following the manufacturer’s instructions, the PCR primer sequences were designed according to the HMGB1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene sequences in GenBank. HMGB1: 285 bp; upstream: 5′-AGTTCAAGGACCCCAATG-3′; downstream: 5′-TGCTCTTCTCAGCCTTGACCA-3′. GAPDH: 347 bp; upstream: 5′-GGAGCCAAAAGGGTCATC-3′; downstream: 5′-CCAGTGAGTTTCCCGTTC-3′. Through incubation with Avian Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcriptase (AMV RT) (Promega, WI 53718, USA), the HMGB1 and GAPDH cDNA were amplified. Swirled with 1 µl ethidium bromide, the amplified cDNA fragments were detected via agarose gel electrophoresis [37]. A comet assay method was applied to examine the intensity of the gene bands. GAPDH mRNA was kept as a housekeeping gene owing to its stability. The tissue of five animals was collected for rt-PCR, and a mean average of three measurements for each animal was performed to obtain a value.

Evaluation of cortical cleaved caspase -3 and -9a mRNA by rt-PCR
The levels of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9a mRNA in the cortical homogenates were determined by TriPure RT-PCR Reagent (Roche Diagnostics Corp. IN 46256, USA). According to the supplier’s instructions, the primer sequences were designed according to the cleaved caspase-3, and -9a and GAPDH gene sequences as stated in GenBank. Cleaved caspase-3 primer is as:393 bp; forward: 5′-GGTATTGAGACAGACAGTGG-3′; reverse: 5′-CATGGGATCTGTTTCTTTGC-3′; caspase-9a primer: 889 bp; forward: 5′-GCTCTTCCTTTGTTCATCTCC-3′; reverse: 5′-CATCTGGCTCGGGGTTACTGC-3′ and GAPDH primer: 347 bp; forward: 5′-GGAGCCAAAAGGGTCATC-3′; reverse: 5′-CCAGTGAGTTTCCCGTTC-3′. After incubation with Avian Myeloblastosis Virus Reverse Transcriptase (AMV RT) (Promega, WI 53711, USA), the cleaved caspase -3, -9a and GAPDH cDNA fragments were amplified and detected via agarose gel electrophoresis mixed with 1 µL of ethidium bromide. The intensity of the genes was measured via a comet assay method. GAPDH mRNA was used as a standard gene. The tissue samples of every five animals were used for rt-PCR and three measurements for each animal specimen performed by an investigator blind to the experiment set. Cleaved caspase-9a represented the majority of catalyzed pro-caspase-9.

Immuno-staining with polyclonal anti-rat NeuN, GFAP, BrdU and MCP-1 antibody
MCP-1 recruits monocytes, memory T cells, and dendritic cells were detected using a video-assisted microscope (×400). Briefly, isolated rat basilar arteries were perfused and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde. Coronal sections of the basilar arteries were stored overnight on slides at −80 °C. Rabbit monoclonal anti-rat MCP-1 antibody was used at a dilation of 1:40, and immunostaining was performed for 40 min at 25 °C followed by drying overnight as described in the mouse monoclonal alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) technique [37]. The cerebral slice was frozen and cut into 30 μm-thick sections with the assistance of ultra-microtome E (Leica EM UC7, Union Optical and Instruments and Nanotechnology. New Taipei City 22101, Taiwan) Two temporal gyrus cross-sections of each animal were analyzed by two investigators blinded to the experiment set. A rabbit polyclonal BrdU(1:400), NeuN(1:100) and GFAP(1:500) antibody recruited neural-specific RNA splicing was performed for 40 min at 25 °C followed by drying overnight and detected by using a video-assisted microscope (×200).

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. For comparison among groups, all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL 60614, USA). Difference was considered significant at a probability value less than 0.01.

Results
General observation
Throughout the study, there was no significant difference observed in the recorded physiological parameters, including GOT, GPT, BUN, creatinine, pH, blood pressure and arterial blood gas analysis among the experimental groups. This authenticated that 4OGOMV administration in the selected dosage was devoid of hepatic and renal toxicity.

Tissue morphometry and MCP-1 immunostaining
The internal elastic lamina (IEL) in the BAs of SAH and SAH+vehicle groups showed substantial corrugation when compared with that obtained from the controls (Fig. 1, upper panel). IEL disruption was less prominent in the 200 and 400 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV treatment SAH groups. The cross-sectional areas of BAs in the SAH and SAH+vehicle groups were significantly reduced when compared with the control group (0.138 ± 0.028, and 0.135 ± 0.046). 400 μg/kg 4OGOMV attenuated SAH-induced vasoconstriction (Fig. 1, lower panel, P &lt; 0.01). Peri-vascular MCP-1(+) cell level was significantly reduced in the 400ug/kg/day 4OGOMV treatment and the healthy controls when compared with the SAH groups (p &lt; 0.01, Fig. 2). Besides, the smaller branch of basilar artery was also dilated under the 400 μg/kg 4OGOMV treatment (Fig. 1, Upper panel).Fig. 1 Comparison of lumen cross-sectional capacities of the basilar artery (bottom panel).

Neurological deficit
MLPT score was obtained to examine the motor-sensory incorporation of the forelimb and hindlimb and placing/stepping reflex as a reflective response to tactile and proprioceptive stimuli. The sum from these two tests is considered as motor deficit index (MDI). The mean MDI in the SAH and SAH+vehicle groups were 2.65 ± 0.38 and 2.42 ± 0.48, compared with the healthy controls. Treatment with 4OGOMV (at 400 μg/kg) significantly improved the MDI in the SAH groups (Table 1). Likewise, MDI ≥ 3 was substantially decreased in the 4OGOMV treatment SAH groups when compared with the SAH animals. The percentage difference of modified Voetsch neuro-scores was significantly induced in the 400 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV+SAH group and the healthy controls, when compared with the SAH groups (Table 2).Table 1 Modified limb-placing test (MLPT)

mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1
Following the induction of SAH, the CSF IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels were found to increase 1000- and 3000-fold at 24 and 72 h, when compared with the sham-operated group. Administration of 4OGOMV reduced cytokine levels by 8, 45, 52 and 15 % for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 relative to SAH groups at 48 h after 1st SAH (Fig. 3, left column). Levels of IL-1β and MCP-1 were significantly reduced in the 400 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV treatment SAH group. Incidentally, treatment with 4OGOMV failed to reduce IL-8 level to statistical difference from the rats subject to SAH (Fig. 3, p &gt; 0.01).Fig. 3 Bar graph depicting 4OGOMV on the time-course change of pro-inflammatory cytokines after the induction of double shot SAH.

HMGB1 protein expression
HMGB1 were demonstrated to play a critical role in the onset of delayed and systemic inflammation. The expression of HMGB1 protein was not significantly different among the experimental groups at 48 h after the induction of SAH (Fig. 4, left column, p &gt; 0.01). In this study, 4OGOMV (at 200 and 400 μg/kg/day) reduced the expression of HMGB1 protein at 72 h after 2nd SAH, when compared with the SAH group (Fig. 4, right column, p &lt; 0.01).Fig. 4 The time-course expression for High-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) in the SAH rats (Western blot). a SAH; b SAH + vehicle; c 100 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV +SAH; d 200 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV +SAH, and e 400 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV in SAH rats. 4OGOMV dose-dependently attenuated HMGB1 protein expression at 72 h. *, **P &lt; 0.01, experimental animals compared with the SAH group. #, ##P &gt; 0.01, compared with the animals subject to SAH



The activation of HMGB1 mRNA
To observe the neuronal inflammation subsequent to SAH, HMGB1 mRNA was examined.

Discussion
In the present study, 4OGOMV, a natural compound, has been shown to attenuate SAH-induced IL-1β and MCP-1 expression at the initial stage of SAH. However, how to maintain the intensity of neuro-inflammation in delayed vasoconstriction remains unknown. HMGB1, a late-produced immunity mediator, showed a clue to investigate the mechanism of SAH-induced delayed cerebral ischemia. In Li et al’s study, 4OGOMV is demonstrated to modulate the vasoconstriction on rabbit isolated basilar artery rings evoked by KCl and 5-HT [25]. In Wang et al’s group, 4OGOMV was proven to be able to inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells stimulated by TNF-α in a smooth muscle cell culture [27]. In the study of human colon cancer HT-29 cells, 4OGOMV is shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10, which is responsible for two important biological functions: serving as a feasible epigenetic strategy to inhibit the mitotic cell cycle progression and transcriptional activation of immediate pro-inflammatory genes during the interphase [11, 24]. Likewise, in the observation of NeuN, GFAP and BrdU polyclonal immunostating, our result supports 4OGOMV, in a selected dose, is able to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines in the early stage of SAH-induced vascular deformity and also attenuate SAH induced cerebral apoptosis.

Elevated CSF IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α and adhesion molecule levels have been observed mediated by activated glia and imposed in the pathogenesis of aneurismal SAH-induced vasospasm [10, 39, 40]. In Bowman et al’s study, a polyclonal antibody targeted against IL-6 was able to alleviate SAH-induced vasoconstriction in a femoral artery SAH model [41]. A cumulative result indicated that the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is antecedent to radiographic vasospasm (peak at 4th to 14th days after aneurysmal SAH in human subjects) [1, 40, 42], and attenuation of cytokines tends to minimize vascular constriction and reduced cerebral infarct in animals. In this study, IL-1β, and MCP-1 (at 48 h after 1st SAH)) levels were suppressed by the administration of 4OGOMV (at 200 and 400 μg/kg), while IL-6 level was reduced at 400 μg/kg 4OGOMV treatment group at 72 h after 2nd SAH.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also known as chemokine ligand 2(CCL2), is one of the major chemokines that regulate monocytes/macrophages migration and infiltration [11, 12, 43, 44]. Both CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 have been demonstrated to be induced and involved in various diseases such as idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, cytomegalovirus encephalitis, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury and rheumatic arthropathy [15, 22, 23]. Monocyte migration from the blood flow to the vascular endothelium is needed for routine surveillance of tissues in response to inflammation. Besides, CCL2 is reported to induce amylin expression through ERK1/ERK2/JNK-AP1 and NF-κB-related signaling pathways. Amylin upregulation by CCL2 contributes to the elevation of the plasma amylin and insulin resistance in obesity [3]. In this study, MCP-1 positive cells were observed reduced in the media and adventitia of basilar artery in the 200 and 400 μg/kg 4OGOMV treatment SAH group, when compared with the SAH groups.

High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a trigger of inflammation, tissue repair, with a characteristic of attracting inflammatory cells, recruiting stem cells and promoting their proliferation, is released by activated monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, platelets and microglia [8, 17]. It is demonstrated to mediate the immediate and delayed inflammatory responses of vascular endothelial cells. As a late mediator, HMGB1 participated in the pathogenesis of chronic and prefunded inflammation after the early immunity response has resolved [13]. Through bond to transmembrane receptors, like advanced glycation end products (RAGE), toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1 and ERK 2 [16]. Moreover, HMGB1 also induced the expression of adhesion molecules from the activated platelets and microglia to up-regulate the recruitment of inflammation. Qiu et al. stated inhibition of HMGB1 expression is able to reduce focal cerebral ischemia insult by inhibiting the HMGB1/RAGE axis [45]. In this study, 4OGOMV (at 200 and 400 μg/kg) is able to restrict HMGB1 mRNA transcription and protein expression-induced delayed neuro-inflammation by 72 h after the induction of 2nd SAH, which corresponds to the observation of reduced IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 level in the 4OGOMV treatment groups. Moreover, the preri-vascular MCP(+) cells were significantly decreased dose-dependently in the 4OGOMV treatment SAH rats.

In summary, the results of this study show that administration of 4OGOMV, at a therapeutic dosage, is efficacious in the prevention of experimental vasoconstriction and improvement of neuro-behavior function. There are few reports about the bio-function of 4OGOMV, such as a novel epigenetic suppressor of histone H3 phosphorylation in a colon cancer cell lines, vasodilation effect on a rabbit isolated basilar artery rings, and suppression of smooth muscle cell hyperplasia induced by TNF-α [24, 26]. This is the first study indwelled in the immunosuppressive effect of 4OGOMV on SAH-induced vasospasm. Besides, 4OGOMV, by reducing HMGB1 mRNA activation, exerts a dual effect on microglia-related T cell transmigration and IL-6-related delayed inflammatory cascade.

Likewise, when considering the neuroprotective effect of 4OGOMV on the SAH rats, activated caspases-3 and -9a, which correspond to mitochodria related cellular apoptosis, were significantly reduced in the 400 μg/kg/day 4OGOMV treatment groups, when compared with the SAH rats. In mammals, there are three major pathways observed in the mitochondria related apoptosis: (1) the extrinsic receptor-related pathway; (2) the intrinsic pathway and (3) the cytotoxic lymphocyte-initiated granzyme B pathway [46, 48]. Shi el al has identified 14 caspases and subdivided them into one initiator group, such as caspase-8 and -9, one downstream effecter group, like caspase-3, -6, and -7, and another pro-inflammatory group, enrolled caspases-1, -4, -5, -11, -12, and -13 [47]. Caspase-3 is believed to be the major effecter caspase in neuronal apoptosis. Caspase-3 played a critical role in determining profound cerebral hyperplasia and deployment disorganization was observed in a study of caspase-3 knockout mice [46]. By now, the distinct roles of each caspase are still undefined. Besides, caspases act on upstream intrinsic apoptosis and downstream of cytochrome c release [47]. In this study, 4OGOMV was observed able to reduce the initiator caspase-9a (at 400 μg/kg/day) and decrease effector Ccspase-3 (at 400 μg/kg/day). It is believed 4OGOMV, at a selected dose, is devoid of hepatic and systemic toxicity and has a neuroprotective effect by blocking both initiator caspase-9a and effector caspase-3 activation as other HDAI does [49].

Conclusions
The acuminated results arouse interest to consider the pathogenesis of SAH-induced acute and delayed neuroinflammation and its effect dictates on the patient’s outcome. The breakout of T-cell immigration accompanying SAH is a critical and complicated pathway underlying the development and maintenance of delayed neurologic deficits. Our study shows that administration of 4OGOMV may diminish SAH-induced early pro-inflammation and subsequent HMGB1 stimulation in a rodent model of SAH. This study suggests that 4OGOMV, a natural occurring potent immunosuppressant in a selected dose, could prove clinically useful in preventing and treating SAH-induced vasospasm and early brain injury.
