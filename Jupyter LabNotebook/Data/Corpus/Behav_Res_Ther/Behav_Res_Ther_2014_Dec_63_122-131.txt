Introduction
The treatment of mental health problems is likely to change markedly over the next 10–20 years, as a result of the widespread availability of the Internet and of mobile-device applications (apps), and their ability to deliver direct to the user certain psychological treatments. This change will greatly increase the availability of these treatments, but it will be associated with risks, a major one being the promulgation of ineffective or even harmful interventions. Clinicians and the public alike will therefore need access to authoritative and up-to-date guidance regarding the empirical status and clinical utility of the many online and app-based interventions (referred to here as e-therapy).

Research on the effectiveness of e-therapy is still at an early stage. The number of outcome studies is modest but it is increasing rapidly and has been the focus of several systematic reviews and meta-analyses (). In general, the conclusions drawn have been strikingly positive with the effectiveness and acceptability of e-therapy being highlighted.

E-therapy should be evaluated no differently from other therapeutic interventions. The relevant studies and their data should be subject to the same independent and rigorous scrutiny as those from studies of drug treatments and surgical interventions. The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) specialises in conducting such evaluations. This paper describes the application of NICE systematic review methodology to the studies of e-therapy, focusing in particular on interventions designed to prevent or treat eating disorders. Previous reviews of this research () have been narrower in focus than the present study and did not use NICE methodology.

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by staff from the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH), a centre established by NICE for the evaluation of mental health interventions. The presentation of the findings follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA; ).

Eligibility criteria
All published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of e-therapies designed to prevent or treat eating disorders, compared with a control condition or any other active intervention, were eligible for inclusion in the review. No restrictions were placed on the type of sample recruited. The samples included participants from the general population, high risk groups, and full cases. E-therapies were defined as interventions that were primarily delivered via a computer, mobile phone or tablet, although there could be limited additional therapist contact. The means of delivery included the Internet, downloadable software, CD-ROMs and mobile-device apps.

Studies were excluded if the therapist was the primary means of delivering the intervention, as in face-to-face treatments augmented with an e-therapy component. Interventions that were delivered entirely by a therapist but transmitted electronically (e.g. CBT delivered via videoconferencing) were also excluded. Studies presented solely in conference abstracts or dissertations/theses were also excluded, as were those reported in languages other than English.

Search strategy
The main strategy involved a search for published studies in the following electronic databases: Embase, Medline, PreMedline, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, Cochrane Central Database of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), British Education Index (BEI), British Humanities Index (BHI), International Bibliography of Social Science (IBSS), Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC), Public Affairs Information Service International (PAIS International) and Social Services Abstracts (SSA) from database inception to 10th July 2014 (see  for the search strategy containing a full list of the search terms used). Citations were screened by one reviewer (CEL) and checked by a research assistant. Hard-copies of studies that were judged to be potentially relevant to the review were obtained. Two reviewers (MEP and CGF) confirmed the eligibility of all the identified studies with disagreements being resolved by discussion.

The electronic search was supplemented by manual searches on www.clinicaltrials.gov for unpublished trials of relevance to the review. Where eligible trials were found, unpublished data were requested from the investigators. Finally, the reference lists of the included studies and of previous reviews of relevance to the topic were checked for additional studies.

Data extraction
Study characteristics and outcome data were captured using electronic data extraction forms by one reviewer (CEL) and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer (MEP). Where studies met inclusion criteria but did not report outcome data in a form that could be used in the analysis, authors were contacted to obtain data in an alternative form.

The following outcomes were examined at the end of the intervention and at follow-up: a) weight concern, shape concern, dietary restraint, bulimia, drive for thinness and global eating disorder psychopathology; b) binge eating and inappropriate weight control behaviour including, vomiting, laxative/diuretic misuse and excessive exercising; c) cessation of binge eating and inappropriate weight control behaviour, and remission from the eating disorder in question (i.e., no longer meeting diagnostic criteria).

Quality assessment
The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to make an assessment of the potential for bias in each individual study (). Studies were rated in terms of six domains: sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants, assessors, and providers; selective outcome reporting; and incomplete data. An overall risk of bias rating was provided for each study based on the probability of any source of bias having a significant influence on the study results (not as a sum of the number of sources of bias).

The GRADE approach was used to assess the confidence in the effect estimates (quality of evidence) for each outcome (). This approach is a structured method that takes into consideration five separate factors: 1) risk of bias; 2) inconsistency (I2 &gt; 50%, p &lt; 0.05); 3) indirectness of the population, intervention, control or outcomes; 4) imprecision (number of participants less than the optimal information size, assumed to be N = 400); 5) publication bias. Confidence in the effect estimates was categorised as 1) ‘high’ (very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect); 2) ‘moderate’ (moderately confident in the effect estimate and the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different); 3) ‘low’ (confidence in the effect estimate is limited and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect); or 4) ‘very low’ (very little confidence in the effect estimate and the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect) (). Evidence from RCTs is initially classed as ‘high’, but confidence in the evidence may decrease on the basis of the five factors listed above.

Data analysis
Data were synthesised using RevMan Version 5.2 (). All effect sizes are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For continuous outcomes, means (M) and standard deviations (SD) were used to calculate the effect size, expressed as a standardised mean difference (SMD), using the Hedges g () correction for small sample size. A SMD of less than 0.20 was considered to be a very small effect, 0.20 a small effect, 0.50 a medium effect and 0.80 a large effect. For trials where M and SD were not provided, if p values for the net effect were reported, these were used to calculate the SMD and associated standard error (SE). For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) was calculated, and used as the effect size. Dichotomous outcomes were weighted using the Mantel-Haenszel method () and continuous outcomes were weighted by the inverse of variance (). Where trials used methods to adjust for attrition bias, these data were used in preference to data from completers. Where individual trial data could be combined, random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. Statistical heterogeneity (variation in study effect sizes) was determined using the I2 statistic, which provides the percentage of total variation in the estimates of effect that is due to heterogeneity between studies (). Where I2 was greater than 50% and statistically significant based on the Chi-squared test, heterogeneity was defined as substantial. In the event of heterogeneity, an a priori subgroup analysis was used to explore whether sample type (general versus at risk population) explained the variance. For this purpose, general population was defined as participants who were unselected for entry into a trial (i.e. study authors did not employ any specific criteria for inclusion in relation to eating disorder psychopathology, this includes participants who enrolled into a trial on the basis of a desire to increase body satisfaction, provided that this was not a criterion imposed by study authors). An at risk population was defined as participants who were selected for entry into a trial on the basis of meeting criteria on a pre-determined measure or self-identification of eating disorder psychopathology.

Results
Study selection
Once duplicate records were removed, the main search strategy identified 1240 papers, of which 71 were retrieved for full-text screening (see  for trial flow). One additional study was obtained through manual searches of the reference lists of included trials and was screened for eligibility. Fifty trials were excluded (see  for excluded studies with reasons for exclusion). In total, 20 RCTs (published in 21 papers) met all eligibility criteria, and were included in the review. Outcomes in 14 of the 20 studies could be appropriately combined in a meta-analysis.

The characteristics of the trials are shown in . Seventeen of the 20 studies evaluated cognitive behavioural interventions. Sixteen studies used the internet as the primary means of delivering the intervention. The remaining four used CD-ROMs. None of the studies evaluated the use of mobile-device app-delivered interventions. Thirteen studies focused on preventing an eating disorder from developing, six investigated treatment interventions, and one (reported in two publications) focused on an intervention designed to prevent relapse. Accordingly, the results have been subdivided into prevention, treatment and relapse prevention studies (see  for a summary of the findings with details of the confidence in the effect estimates).

Quality of evidence
Based on the GRADE approach (), confidence in the effect estimates were graded as moderate to very low, often because of high risk of bias (see  for risk of bias assessments for each study), but also because of inconsistency, indirectness and imprecision in certain outcomes (see ). Due to the small number of studies, publication bias could not be assessed statistically.

Findings
Prevention studies
Eight of the 20 RCTs were concerned with the efficacy of the ‘Student Bodies’ program, a CBT-based intervention designed to reduce body dissatisfaction (). Meta-analyses were performed for all outcomes. These showed that when compared with a waitlist control, Student Bodies was associated with small improvements in drive for thinness and weight concern at the end of the intervention and at follow-up, although for weight concern the effect estimate was imprecise at the end of the intervention. Small effects were also observed for shape concern, dietary restraint and global eating disorder psychopathology at follow-up only, however for shape concern the estimate was imprecise. The evidence was inconclusive for bulimia. Confidence in the effect estimates was moderate for the majority of the outcomes.

One study of Student Bodies included participants with disordered eating attitudes and behaviour, and it reported additional outcome variables (). For frequency of binge eating the evidence was inconclusive at the end of the intervention, although a small effect was found at follow-up. There were large improvements in combined cessation rates of binge eating, vomiting, laxative/diuretic misuse and restrictive eating at the end of the intervention (41% of participants in the intervention group versus 17% in the control group). This was supported by the results at follow-up, although the estimate was imprecise. The evidence was inconclusive for vomiting and/or diuretic/laxative misuse, and rates of remission from subthreshold eating disorders.

Substantial heterogeneity was observed across these studies in the meta-analyses of the weight concern and drive for thinness outcomes. To investigate this, findings were subgrouped by population type (general population versus at risk population). The size of the effect did not differ between the two groups, and for both outcomes all of the difference between groups could be explained by random variation (I2 for subgroup differences = 0%).

In one study, Student Bodies was compared with a classroom-based body image education intervention (). In this comparison, the evidence was inconclusive across all outcomes and confidence in the effect estimates was low.

Of the remaining studies one was concerned with a CD-ROM delivered psychoeducation program entitled ‘Food, Mood and Attitude’ (FMA), designed to reduce the risk of developing an eating disorder in young adult women who were rated at high or low risk (). For the purpose of this review, only the high risk participants were included in the analysis. There were no conclusive differences between the intervention and a control across all outcomes. Confidence in the effect estimates was low.

Another study investigated an internet-delivered intervention based on cognitive dissonance theory, designed to prevent the development of an eating disorder in women with body image concerns (). The intervention was compared with a control and with a face-to-face intervention based on cognitive dissonance theory. In both comparisons, the evidence was inconclusive for all outcomes and confidence in the effect estimates was moderate.

A further study examined an internet-delivered program (‘ESS-KIMO’) designed to enhance motivation to change in people with an eating disorder through the use of motivational interviewing techniques (). At the end of the intervention, when compared with a waitlist control condition, ESS-KIMO was associated with small improvements in shape concern, dietary restraint and vomiting. The evidence was inconclusive for weight concern. Confidence in the effect estimates was low for all outcomes.

Finally, two studies compared a version of Student Bodies (SB2-BED) designed for adolescents at risk of developing binge eating disorder with a waitlist control (). At the end of the intervention and at follow-up, the evidence was inconclusive for all outcomes except binge eating where there was a small effect in favour of the waitlist condition at follow-up (). Confidence in the effect estimates was low for all outcomes.

Treatment studies
Four of the 20 studies investigated the efficacy of CBT-based e-therapy in the treatment of adults with bulimia nervosa (). At the end of the intervention, when compared with a waitlist control condition, CBT-based e-therapy was associated with small improvements in binge eating, vomiting and/or laxative misuse, and improved rates of cessation of binge eating, vomiting and/or laxative misuse (24% of participants in the intervention group versus 13% in the control group). Confidence in the effect estimates was low. For the remaining outcomes, the evidence was inconclusive at the end of the intervention, and for some outcomes the confidence in the effect estimates was very low due to substantial inconsistency in the meta-analyses as well as other factors. Only one trial included a follow-up assessment (), and it found medium to large effects in favour of CBT-based e-therapy on several outcomes including, binge eating, vomiting and/or laxative misuse, global eating disorder psychopathology, weight concern, shape concern and dietary restraint, although confidence in the effect estimates was low.

Two studies compared CBT-based e-therapy with bibliotherapy in the treatment of bulimia nervosa (). The evidence was inconclusive for all outcomes and there was low confidence in the effect estimates.

Two studies compared CBT-based e-therapy with a waitlist control condition in the treatment of adults with binge eating disorder (). CBT-based e-therapy was associated with large improvements in cessation of binge eating at the end of the intervention. One study found large improvements in a measure of bulimic features at the end of the intervention, although this was inconclusive at follow-up (). There were no conclusive results for any of the other outcomes and confidence in the effect estimates was low.

Finally, one other study compared CBT-based e-therapy with face-to-face group-based CBT (). The evidence for all outcomes was inconclusive and confidence in the effect estimates was low.

Relapse prevention studies
A single study, published in two papers, investigated an online CBT-based relapse prevention program, compared with treatment-as-usual, for women with anorexia nervosa or subthreshold anorexia nervosa who had been recently discharged from hospital (). The program was associated with small improvements in clinician-rated bulimia, and self- and clinician-rated global eating disorder psychopathology at the end of the intervention, although for clinician-rated global eating disorder psychopathology, the estimate was imprecise. Small improvements were also observed on the frequency of inappropriate weight control behaviour and self-rated bulimia at follow-up, although the estimate for self-rated bulimia was imprecise. The evidence was inconclusive for the remaining outcomes. Confidence in the effect estimates was low to moderate.

Discussion
In this study we applied the methods and standards used by NICE to the research on e-therapy, focusing on interventions designed to prevent or treat eating disorders. This has not been done before. There were four main findings. First, the evidence base is small. The literature search identified just 20 studies, none of which were of mobile-device apps. Second, no firm conclusions can be drawn from the treatment studies. Few effects emerged and there was low confidence in the effect estimates. Third, somewhat more positive findings emerged from the prevention studies, predominantly from the studies involving the ‘Student Bodies’ program. There was a small reduction in the level of eating disorder psychopathology, and in the levels of weight concern and drive for thinness, with there being moderate confidence in the effect estimates. Lastly, an online relapse prevention program was associated with some positive effects, but these came from only one study.

Our findings and conclusions are at variance with those from the two prior systematic reviews.  concluded that “the internet is a promising vehicle for delivering eating disorder treatment” (p. 551) and  stated that “internet-based interventions based upon CBT principles can be assumed to be a good alternative to face-to-face therapies for the treatment of eating disorders” (p. 15). We cannot agree. We have found that if the standards applied to the research on other treatments are applied to e-therapy, then it is impossible to describe the finding as “promising” and there is certainly no basis for saying that e-therapy is a good alternative to face-to-face treatment. Instead, we conclude that the value of e-therapy for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder is at present uncertain, and nothing is known about its effect as a treatment for anorexia nervosa. This being the case, it would be inappropriate at present to encourage this application of e-therapy. In contrast, the online preventive program ‘Student Bodies’ is associated with a reduction in the level of eating disorder psychopathology, albeit a modest one. The importance of this finding is unclear, however, as it is not known whether a change of this type and magnitude has a meaningful impact on the risk of subsequently developing an eating disorder (). This needs to be established before the program can be recommended.

As e-therapy is here to stay, and this mode of treatment delivery has many advantages over face-to-face therapy (), it needs more research attention. In our view, the current e-therapy treatment programs need re-thinking as at present they are basic in form and content. They make little use of two of the major strengths of the Internet, the ability to personalise interventions and make them interactive. Indeed, the existing interventions differ little from written self-help programmes. Their content also needs attention. At present it is largely focused on binge eating, like the early cognitive behavioural treatments for bulimia nervosa (e.g., ), whereas most contemporary treatments for eating disorders address additional features with the goal of achieving lasting change (). Research on e-therapy interventions also needs to be improved.  and  have made many important suggestions. We would also like to highlight the need for direct-to-user studies as herein lies the greatest potential strength of e-therapy, its ability to directly reach those who would benefit from it ().

Finally, the complete absence of trials evaluating mobile-device apps demands comment. The fact that there is no evidence to support their use needs to be brought to the attention of clinicians and users as some eating disorder apps promote the idea that they aid recovery. This would not be allowed if they were forms of medication yet, like medication, they have the potential to do harm. For example, people with eating disorders (and those around them) may think that by using an app they are addressing their eating disorder whereas in reality they may be simply delaying their entry into an empirically-supported form of treatment. Apps, as with other forms of e-therapy, may have a place in the eating disorder armamentarium, but this needs to be demonstrated empirically.

#Outcomes of relevance to the review were only reported at follow-up.

Reasons for downgrading, based on the GRADE approach:

Risk of bias (one or more of the following: selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, selective outcome reporting bias).

Inconsistency (I2 &gt; 50%, p &lt; 0.05).

Indirectness (comparison: waitlist control).

Imprecision (optimal information size for dichotomous outcomes = 300 events, and for continuous outcomes = 400 participants).
