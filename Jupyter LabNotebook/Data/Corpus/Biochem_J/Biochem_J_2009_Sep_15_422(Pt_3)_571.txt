A number of abbreviations were defined incorrectly in this paper, and the correct abbreviations are spelt out below:

1) Following the most recent classification system for lipids [], throughout the paper “GPEtn” should have been used as the abbreviation for phosphatidylethanolamine, not glycerophosphoethanolamine. Similarly, “GPCho” should have been used as the abbreviation for phosphatidylcholine, and not glycerophosphocholine.

2) Throughout the paper, “Etn-P” and “Cho-P” should have been used for ethanolamine-phosphate and choline-phosphate respectively instead of “PtdEtn” and “PtdCho”.

3) In the last paragraph before the conclusions, GPEtn should have been used instead of PtdEtn.
