INTRODUCTION
Autosomal dominant missense mutations within the gene encoding LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein
kinase 2) predispose humans to Parkinson's disease [,]. Patients with LRRK2 mutations generally develop Parkinson's
disease with clinical appearance and symptoms indistinguishable from idiopathic disease at around
60–70 years of age []. Mutations in LRRK2
account for 4% of familial Parkinson's disease, and are observed in 1% of sporadic Parkinson's
disease patients []. Over 40 missense mutations have been
reported []. The most frequent mutation comprises an amino
acid substitution of the highly conserved Gly2019, located within the subdomain VII-DFG
motif of the kinase domain for a serine residue [], which
enhances the protein kinase activity of LRRK2 approx. 2-fold []. Two other mutations (R1728H and T2031S) also increase LRRK2 protein kinase activity
[]. These observations indicate that inhibitors of LRRK2 may
have utility for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

The intrinsic protein kinase catalytic activity of LRRK2 is readily measured in
vitro using assays employing peptide substrates such as LRRKtide (RLGRDKYKTLRQIRQGNTKQR)
[] or Nictide []
(RLGWWRFYTLRRARQGNTKQR). This has made it possible to undertake screens to identify inhibitors.
Recent work has shown that a widely deployed ROCK (Rho-kinase) inhibitor termed H-1152 also
inhibited LRRK2 with similar potency (IC50 of 150 nM) []. The multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib, used for the treatment of
renal cell carcinoma and other cancers, also inhibits LRRK2 (IC50 of 20 nM) [–]. We have also
found that the structurally diverse H-1152 and sunitinib inhibitors suppress the activity of the
LRRK2(G2019S) mutant 2–4-fold more potently than wild-type LRRK2 []. On the basis of molecular modelling of the LRRK2 kinase domain we have
previously designed a drug-resistant LRRK2(A2016T) mutant that is normally active, but 32-fold less
sensitive to H-1152 and 12-fold less sensitive to sunitinib [].

A bottleneck in the development of LRRK2 inhibitors is how to assess the relative effectiveness
of these compounds in vivo, as little is known about how LRRK2 is regulated and
what its substrates are. We recently demonstrated that LRRK2 interacts with 14-3-3 protein isoforms
and binding is mediated through phosphorylation of two conserved LRRK2 residues (Ser910
and Ser935) that lie before the leucine-rich repeats []. Disruption of 14-3-3 interaction by mutation of Ser910 and/or
Ser935 to an alanine residue does not affect LRRK2 kinase activity but has an impact on
LRRK2 localization, causing it to accumulate within cytoplasmic pools instead of being diffusely
localized throughout the cytoplasm []. It has also been
reported that various mutant forms, such as LRRK2(R1441C) and LRRK2(Y1699C), accumulated within
cytosolic pools that were suggested to comprise aggregates of misfolded protein []. By comparing the properties of 41
Parkinson's-disease-associated mutations of LRRK2 we found that LRRK2(R1441C) and LRRK2(Y1699C), as
well as eight other mutants, displayed reduced phosphorylation of
Ser910/Ser935 and interaction with 14-3-3 []. Consistent with 14-3-3 regulating localization, most mutants displaying reduced 14-3-3
binding accumulated within cytoplasmic pools []. Although a
great deal of further analysis is required to work out how 14-3-3 binding regulates LRRK2, these
results suggest that disrupting the interaction of LRRK2 with 14-3-3 could be linked to Parkinson's
disease.

In the present study we provide pharmacological evidence that LRRK2 protein kinase activity
indirectly regulates phosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 and hence controls
binding to 14-3-3 isoforms. Thus inhibition of LRRK2 causes dephosphorylation of
Ser910/Ser935 and hence dissociation of 14-3-3 binding causing LRRK2 to
accumulate within cytoplasmic pools. Our study indicates that monitoring phosphorylation of
Ser910/Ser935, 14-3-3 binding and/or visualization of LRRK2 accumulation of
LRRK2 into cytoplasmic pools can be deployed to monitor the activity of LRRK2 inhibitors in
cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and general methods
Tissue-culture reagents were from Life Technologies and [γ32P]ATP was from
PerkinElmer. P81 phosphocellulose paper was from Whatman. Pepceuticals synthesized Nictide. The
Flp-in T-REx system was from Invitrogen and stable cell lines, generated according to the
manufacturer's instructions by selection with hygromycin, have been described previously []. Restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations and other recombinant
DNA procedures were performed using standard protocols. All mutagenesis was carried out using the
QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DNA constructs used for transfection
were purified from Escherichia coli DH5α using Qiagen or Invitrogen plasmid
Maxi kits according to the manufacturer's protocol. All DNA constructs were verified by DNA
sequencing, which was performed by the Sequencing Service, School of Life Sciences, University of
Dundee, Scotland, U.K., using DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Amersham Biosciences) on Applied
Biosystems automated DNA sequencers. H-1152 was purchased from Calbiochem, Sunitinib was from LC
Laboratories and generation and use of GSK429286A was described previously [,]. Other inhibitors used (in
Supplementary Figure S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/430/bj4300405add.htm) were obtained from the Division of
Signal Transduction Therapy Unit at the University of Dundee.

Buffers
Lysis buffer contained 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF,
5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 M sucrose, 1 mM benzamidine and 2 mM
PMSF, and was supplemented with either 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 or 0.5% NP-40 (Nonidet P40) with
150 mM NaCl as indicated. Buffer A contained 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5,
50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.27 M sucrose.

Cell culture, treatments and cell lysis
HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 and Swiss 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified
Eagle's medium) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (fetal bovine serum), 2 mM glutamine and
1× penicillin/streptomycin solution. T-REx cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% (v/v) FBS and 2 mM glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin solution,
15 μg/ml blastocidin and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Cultures were induced to
express the indicated protein by inclusion of 1 μg/ml doxycycline in the culture
medium for the indicated times.

Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from individuals within an Arab–Berber
population, screened for the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation [] and
lymphoblastoid cell lines were generated by EBV (Epstein–Barr virus) transformation of B
lymphocytes using standard methods (European Collection of Cell Cultures). Cell-line ANK is derived
from a 47-year-old individual homozygous for the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation who presented with
Parkinson's disease. Cell-line AHE is derived from a 31-year-old individual, lacking mutation at the
LRRK2 Gly2019 residue, and presented with no disease. Human lymphoblastoid cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1× penicillin/streptomycin
solution and were maintained at cell density of
0.3×106–2×106 cells per ml. Cell transfections were
performed by the polyethyleneimine method []. Where
inhibitors were utilized, they were dissolved in DMSO and used at the indicated concentrations with
an equivalent volume of DMSO used as a control. The final concentration of DMSO in the culture
medium was never more than 0.1%. Inhibitors were added to the culture medium for the indicated times
before lysis. For a 15-cm-diameter dish, HEK-293 cells were lysed with 1.0 ml and Swiss 3T3
cells were lysed with 0.6 ml of lysis buffer supplemented with the indicated detergent, and
clarified by centrifugation at 16000 g at 4 °C
for 10 min. When not used immediately, all lysate supernatants were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined
using the Bradford method with BSA as the standard.

Antibodies
Anti-LRRK2-(100–500) (S348C and S406C) and anti-LRRK2-(2498–2514) (S374C)
antibodies were described previously []. The antibody against
LRRK2 phosphoSer910 (S357C) was generated by injection of the KLH (keyhole-limpet
haemocyanin)-conjugated phosphopeptide VKKKSNpSISVGEFY (where pS is phosphoserine) into sheep and
was affinity purified by positive and negative selection against the phospho- and
de-phospho-peptides respectively. The antibody against LRRK2 phosphoSer935 (S814C) was
generated by injection of the KLH-conjugated phosphopeptide NLQRHSNpSLGPIFDH into sheep and was
affinity purified by positive and negative selection against the phospho and de-phospho-peptides
respectively. Sheep polyclonal antibody S662B was raised against chicken MBP (maltose-binding
protein)–MYPT (myosin phosphatase-targeting) amino acids (714–1004). The rabbit
polyclonal antibody against MYPT phosphoThr850 was from Upstate Biotechnology (catalogue
number 36-003). Anti-GFP (green fluorescent protein) antibody (S268B) was raised against recombinant
GFP and affinity purified against the antigen. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody and affinity matrix were from
Sigma–Aldrich. Nanotrap GFP-binder affinity matrix was from ChromoTek. The rabbit polyclonal
antibody recognizing 14-3-3 (catalogue number K-19) and control anti-(rabbit IgG) antibody
(catalogue number SC-2027) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Immunological procedures
Cell lysates (10–30 μg) were resolved by SDS/PAGE or Novex 4–12%
gradient gels, and electroblotted on to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5%
(w/v) skimmed milk powder in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20) buffer (50 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20). For anti-phospho- antibodies,
primary antibody was used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml, diluted in 5% (w/v) skimmed
milk powder in TBST with the inclusion of 10 μg/ml dephosphorylated peptide. All other
antibodies were used at 1 μg/ml in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in TBST. Detection of
immune complexes was performed using either fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular
Probes) followed by visualization using an Odyssey® LI-COR imaging system or by HRP
(horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce) and an enhanced chemiluminescence
reagent. For immunoprecipitations, antibody was non-covalently coupled to Protein G–Sepharose
with of 1 μg of antibody/μl of beads, or anti-FLAG M2–agarose was
utilized. Cell lysate was incubated with coupled antibody for 1 h. Immune complexes were
washed twice with lysis buffer, supplemented with 0.3 M NaCl, and twice with buffer A.
Precipitates were either used as a source of kinase or immediately analysed by immunoblot. DIG
(digoxigenin)-labelled 14-3-3 for use in overlay far-Western blotting analysis was prepared as
described in []. To directly assess 14-3-3 interaction with
LRRK2, immunoprecipitates were electroblotted on to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5%
(w/v) skimmed milk powder for 30 min. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with
DIG-labelled 14-3-3 diluted to 1 μg/ml in 5% (w/v) BSA in TBST overnight at
4 °C. DIG 14-3-3 was detected with HRP-labelled anti-DIG Fab fragments (Roche).

LRRK2 immunoprecipitation kinase assays
Peptide kinase assays were set up in a total volume of 50 μl with
immunoprecipitated LRRK2 as a source of kinase, in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5,
0.1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2 and 0.1 mM [γ32P]ATP
(~500–1000 c.p.m./pmol) in the presence of 20 μM Nictide peptide
substrate. Reactions were terminated by applying 40 μl of the reaction mixture on to
P81 phosphocellulose paper and immersion in 50 mM phosphoric acid. After extensive washing,
reaction products were quantified by Cerenkov counting.

Fluorescence microscopy
HEK-293 Flp-in T-REx were purchased from Invitrogen and stable cells harbouring GFP-tagged
wild-type and mutant forms of LRRK2 were generated using standard protocols. Cells were plated in
four-well glass-bottomed CC2™-coated chamber slides (Nunc). At 1 day after
plating, cells were induced with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline and 24 h later, cells
were fixed in 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde) in PBS. For staining of microtubules, cells, induced
as above, were washed twice in 37 °C medium, and fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA for
15 min. Cells were washed with PBS, permeabilized with 1% (v/v) NP-40 in PBS for
10 min then blocked with 10% (v/v) normal goat serum after washing. Microtubules were stained
with rat monoclonal clone YL1/2 (a gift form Dr Inke Nathke, University of Dundee). Cells were
stained with goat anti-rat antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor®594 (Molecular Probes). Cells
were mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen) and imaged under the same settings for each mutant, on a
Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope using an αPlan-Apochromat ×100 objective.

RESULTS
LRRK2 inhibitors induced dephosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935 and
disrupted 14-3-3 binding
To investigate how inhibition of LRRK2 protein kinase activity affects on
Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation, we initially treated Swiss 3T3 cells with
increasing amounts of the LRRK2 inhibitors H-1152 (A)
or sunitinib (C). Strikingly, H-1152 and sunitinib
induced a dose-dependent dephosphorylation of endogenous LRRK2 at Ser910 and
Ser935, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in 14-3-3 binding. We found that
10–30 μM H-1152 or 3–10 μM sunitinib induced almost
complete dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935, resulting in a loss of 14-3-3
binding. The inhibitory effects of H-1152 (B) and
sunitinib (D) on endogenous
LRRK2-Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding were observed within
30 min and were sustained for at least 2 h. H-1152 treatment caused a marked decrease
in the phosphorylation of Thr850 of the ROCK substrate MYPT1, whereas sunitinib did not
(), suggesting that the dephosphorylation of LRRK2 at
Ser910 and Ser935 was not due to ROCK inhibition. To further rule out an
effect of ROCK in regulating Ser910 and Ser935 phosphorylation, we employed
the selective ROCK inhibitor GSK429286A that does not inhibit LRRK2 [] and found that this compound did not inhibit Ser910/Ser935
phosphorylation or 14-3-3 binding (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/430/bj4300405add.htm).

H-1152 and sunitinib treatment leads to dephosphorylation of Ser910 and
Ser935 and disruption of 14-3-3 interaction
(A) Endogenous LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-LRRK2-(100–500)
(S348C) antibody from Swiss 3T3 cells treated with DMSO vehicle control or the indicated
concentrations of H-1152 for 90 min. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis
with the indicated antibody as well as 14-3-3 overlay far-Western analysis. The immunoblot analysis
was quantified by Odyssey® LI-COR analysis with the histogram at the top of each panel
representing the ratio of Ser910 phosphorylation to total LRRK2, the lower histogram
represents the ratio of Ser935 phosphorylation to total LRRK2. (B)
Endogenous LRRK2 immunoprecipitates were analysed as in (A), except that cells were
treated with 30 μM H-1152 for the indicated time prior to cell lysis. (C
and D) Endogenous LRRK2 immunoprecipitates were analysed as in (A and
B) respectively, except that sunitinib was employed rather than H-1152. Results are
means±S.E.M. and are representative of at least two separate experiments performed in
duplicate. AU, arbitrary units.

Evidence that LRRK2 kinase activity controls Ser910 and Ser935
phosphorylation as well as 14-3-3 binding
To study whether the effect of H-1152 and sunitinib on LRRK2 Ser910/Ser935
phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding resulted from inhibition of LRRK2 protein kinase activity, we
treated HEK-293 cells overexpressing LRRK2(G2019S) or the H-1152/sunitinib-resistant
LRRK2(A2016T/G2019S) double-mutant with LRRK2 inhibitors. As observed with the endogenous LRRK2, we
found that H-1152 and sunitinib induced a dose-dependent dephosphorylation of the Parkinson's
disease LRRK2(G2019S) mutant at Ser910 and Ser935, as well as disrupting
binding to 14-3-3 (A, upper panel). Crucially, however,
neither H-1152 nor sunitinib significantly inhibited Ser910 or Ser935
phosphorylation or 14-3-3 binding to the drug-resistant LRRK2(A2016T/G2019S) mutant (A, lower panel). This strongly suggests that the ability of
H-1152 and sunitinib to induce dephosphorylation of Ser910, as well as Ser935,
and hence disrupt 14-3-3 binding is dependent upon the ability of these compounds to inhibit LRRK2
protein kinase activity.

Evidence that LRRK2 kinase activity controls Ser910 and Ser935
phosphorylation, as well as 14-3-3 binding
(A and B) HEK-293 cells transiently expressing the indicated forms of
FLAG–LRRK2 were treated with DMSO vehicle control or indicated concentrations of H-1152 or
sunitinib for 90 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 0.5% NP-40 and
150 mM NaCl and subjected to anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were resolved
by SDS/PAGE (4–12% Novex gels) and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (total LRRK2),
anti-phospho-Ser910 (αpS910), anti-phospho-Ser935 (αpS935)
antibodies, as well as a 14-3-3 overlay assay, as indicated. Similar results were obtained in two
separate experiments.

In agreement with the pharmacological data demonstrating that H-1152 and sunitinib inhibit mutant
LRRK2(G2019S) 2–4-fold more potently than wild-type LRRK2 [], we found that H-1152 and sunitinib were more potent in inducing dephosphorylation and
impairing binding of 14-3-3 to LRRK2(G2019S) than wild-type LRRK2 (compare the upper panels of A and B). The potency
of H-1152 and sunitinib at inducing dephosphorylation of wild-type FLAG–LRRK2 in HEK-293
cells was similar to the effects of these drugs on endogenous LRRK2 in Swiss 3T3 cells (compare
 and B).

Analysis of LRRK2 phosphorylation in Parkinson's disease patient-derived lymphoblastoid
cells
We also studied endogenous LRRK2 activity and phosphorylation in EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid
cells derived from a Parkinson's disease patient harbouring a homozygous LRRK2(G2019S) mutation, in
comparison with those derived from a second individual without an LRRK2 mutation, who presented with
no disease (). This revealed that both cell lines
expressed similar levels of LRRK2 protein, but the intrinsic kinase activity of LRRK2
immunoprecipitated from the homozygous LRRK2(G2019S) cell line was approx. 3-fold higher than that
observed in the wild-type cells, consistent with the G2019S mutation enhancing LRRK2 kinase activity
(A). Both wild-type LRRK2 (B and D) and LRRK2(G2019S) (C and E) were
similarly phosphorylated at Ser910 and Ser935. H-1152 and sunitinib induced
marked dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 in both wild-type and
LRRK2(G2019S) human lymphoblastoid cell lines. However, consistent with the increased sensitivity of
LRRK2(G2019S) for these drugs we observed that H-1152 and sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of
Ser910 and Ser935 in the LRRK2(G2019S) cells more potently than in the
wild-type cells (compare B with C, and D with E).

Analysis of endogenous LRRK2 Ser910 and Ser935 responsiveness to LRRK2
inhibition in Parkinson's disease patient-derived samples
(A) LRRK2 kinase activity was assessed in EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cells from
a patient homozygous for the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation and diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and an
individual without the G2019S mutation. Kinase assays were performed in triplicate and results are
means±S.E.M. (B–E) These cells were then treated with
increasing doses of (B and C) H-1152 or (D and
E) increasing doses of sunitinib for 60 min prior to lysis. LRRK2 was
immunoprecipitated (IP) and the phosphorylation status of Ser910 and Ser935
was assessed following immunoblot and LI-COR quantification analysis. The upper histogram in each
panel represents the ratio of Ser910 phosphorylation to total LRRK2, the lower histogram
represents the ratio of Ser935 phosphorylation to total LRRK2. Results are
means±S.E.M. for a duplicate analysis. Similar results were obtained in two separate
experiments.

Disruption of 14-3-3 binding alters cellular localization of LRRK2
Mutants of LRRK2 that do not interact with 14-3-3, rather than being diffusely localized
throughout the cytoplasm, accumulate within cytoplasmic aggregates []. This prompted us to investigate whether H-1152 treatment induced cytoplasmic
re-localization of GFP–LRRK2 or GFP–LRRK2(G2019S) to discrete cytoplasmic pools (). We employed stable inducible T-REx cells lines expressing,
at low levels, drug-sensitive or drug-resistant (i.e. A2016T mutant) forms of GFP–LRRK2 or
GFP–LRRK2(G2019S). As reported previously [,], in untreated cells GFP–LRRK2 and
GFP–LRRK2(G2019S) was diffusely localized throughout the cytoplasm and not observed in the
nucleus (A). However, H-1152 treatment induced a marked
accumulation of LRRK2 within cytoplasmic pools (A). In
accordance with this effect of H-1152 being mediated via inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity, no
cytoplasmic pool accumulation was observed upon treatment of cells expressing drug-resistant
LRRK2(A2016T) or LRRK2(A2016T/G2019S) with H-1152 (A).
As a further control, we studied the localization of GFP–LRRK2(R1441C) and
GFP–LRRK2(Y1699C), which do not bind 14-3-3 and were shown previously to accumulate within
cytoplasmic pools [,]. We confirmed that these mutants accumulated within cytoplasmic pool-like structures,
similar to those observed for GFP–LRRK2 and GFP–LRRK2(G2019S) following treatment with
H-1152 (compare A and B). There is some difference in the appearance of the morphology of the LRRK2 cytoplasmic
inclusions that forms following drug treatment for 2 h compared with the
GFP–LRRK2(R1441C) and GFP–LRRK2(Y1699C) mutants expressed in HEK-293 cells for
24–36 h (compare A and B). The cytoplasmic accumulations formed after 2 h of drug
treatment appears more fibrillar, suggesting association with cytoskeletal elements. To investigate
this we undertook co-localization studies with anti-tubulin antibodies that revealed marked
co-localization between LRRK2 cytoplasmic inclusions formed following H-1152 treatment and the
microtubule network (C).

Disruption of 14-3-3 binding induces accumulation of LRRK2 within cytoplasmic
aggregates
(A) Stable-inducible T-REx cells lines harbouring the indicated forms of LRRK2 were
incubated for 24 h with 0.1 μg/ml doxycycline to induce expression of
GFP–LRRK2. The indicated cell lines were treated in the absence or presence of the indicated
dose of H-1152 for 90 min prior to fixation. Representative fluorescent micrographs of
GFP–LRRK2 localization are shown. Cytoplasmic aggregates of GFP–LRRK2 are indicated
with white arrows. (B) Fluorescent micrographs representative of cultures of the
indicated forms of GFP–LRRK2 are shown. Cytoplasmic aggregates of GFP–LRRK2 are
indicated with white arrows. Localization analyses were performed in duplicate, and similar results
were observed in two independent experiments. (C) Cells were treated as in
(A) except that slides were co-stained with an anti-tubulin antibody to detect
microtubules (red). GFP–LRRK2 is shown in green and co-localization is shown in yellow.

Evidence that LRRK2 does not autophosphorylate Ser910 and
Ser935
To investigate whether endogenous LRRK2 can phosphorylate itself at Ser910 and
Ser935, we treated Swiss 3T3 cells with no drug, 30 μM H-1152 or
10 μM sunitinib to induce dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935
(). Endogenous LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated, and
immunoprecipitates were washed to remove drug and then incubated in the absence or presence of
magnesium [γ32P]ATP along with 20 μM LRRK2 substrate peptide for
30 min. LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of
Ser910 and Ser935 was quantified. These studies revealed that the LRRK2
isolated from H-1152- or sunitinib-treated cells was dephosphorylated, and possessed similar
activity to LRRK2 isolated from untreated cells, indicating that the drug had been efficiently
removed (). Following incubation with magnesium
[γ32P]ATP, LRRK2 isolated from drug-treated cells autophosphorylated as judged by
incorporation of 32P-radioactivity. Importantly, however, no increase in phosphorylation
of Ser910 or Ser935 was observed following incubation of LRRK2 from
H-1152-treated cells with magnesium [γ32P]ATP. The amount of phosphorylation of
LRRK2 isolated from non-drug-treated cells on Ser910 and Ser935 was also not
increased in the autophosphorylation reaction.

Evidence that Ser910/Ser935 phosphorylation is not mediated by
autophosphorylation
Endogenous LRRK2 was immunoprecipitated from Swiss 3T3 cells treated with DMSO,
30 μM H-1152 or 10 μM sunitinib for 2 h to induce
dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935. Immunoprecipitates were washed
multiple times with lysis buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl to remove inhibitor and were then
incubated in kinase buffer containing 20 μM Nictide in the presence or absence of
magnesium ATP (Mg:ATP) for 30 min. Following incubation, immunoprecipitates were centrifuged
at 6000 g for 0.5 min and the supernatant was spotted on to P81
paper for measurement of LRRK2 kinase activity. Sample buffer was added to the pelleted beads and
LRRK2 Ser910 and Ser935 phosphorylation was quantified following immunoblot
analysis with the indicated antibodies. A membrane was also subjected to autoradiography to assess
LRRK2 autophosphorylation (32P). The minor effect that H-1152 had on LRRK2 kinase assay
is not significant.

Effect of multiple signal transduction inhibitors on Ser910/Ser935
phosphorylation
To gain further insight into the specificity of Ser910 and Ser935
dephosphorylation, HEK-293 cells stably expressing GFP–LRRK2 were treated with a panel of 33
kinase inhibitors including those that suppress major signal transduction pathways in cells
including the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase), mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), ERK
(extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), p38, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and innate immune
signalling pathways (Supplementary Figure S2). All inhibitors were utilized at the higher limits of
concentrations known to suppress signalling pathways. As expected, 10 μM sunitinib
induced marked dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935, whereas 32 of the
inhibitors tested did not significantly affect dephosphorylation of
Ser910/Ser935. Some dephosphorylation of Ser910 and
Ser935 was observed with the relatively non-specific JNK inhibitor SP600125, which was
used at a concentration of 15 μM and is known to inhibit many protein kinases more
potently than JNK []. It should be noted that the more
potent JNK inhibitor AS601245 did not induce dephosphorylation of these sites. Further work will be
required to delineate the protein kinase(s) that directly mediate Ser910 and
Ser935 phosphorylation.

DISCUSSION
The key finding of the present study is that the kinase activity of LRRK2 indirectly controls
phosphorylation of Ser910/Ser935 and hence 14-3-3 binding, as well as LRRK2
cytoplasmic localization. In the cell lines we have investigated [Swiss 3T3 (), HEK-293 () and
patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells ()]
phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935, and hence binding to 14-3-3,
was reversed by treatment with the structurally diverse H-1152 and sunitinib LRRK2 inhibitors. We
have also found that H-1152 induces LRRK2 to accumulate within discrete cytoplasmic pools that are
similar to those observed for LRRK2 mutants that do not bind 14-3-3 [] (B). We conclude that dephosphorylation and
cytoplasmic re-localization results from inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity, as LRRK2 inhibitors
are ineffective at inducing dephosphorylation or re-localization of drug-resistant LRRK2(A2016T)
mutants (). The finding that H-1152 and sunitinib are
more potent at inducing Ser910/Ser935 dephosphorylation of LRRK2(G2019S) than
wild-type LRRK2 (), is also consistent with these drugs
inhibiting LRRK2(G2019S) 2–4-fold more potently than the wild-type LRRK2 [].

A key question concerns the mechanism by which LRRK2 controls phosphorylation of
Ser910 and Ser935. One possibility is that Ser910 and
Ser935 comprise direct LRRK2 autophosphorylation sites. However, our results suggest that
dephosphorylated LRRK2 isolated from H-1152- or sunitinib-treated cells is unable to phosphorylate
itself at Ser910/Ser935 following incubation with magnesium ATP (). This is consistent with LRRK2 having a marked preference
for phosphorylating threonine residues over serine residues, as demonstrated by the finding that
replacing the phosphorylated threonine residue in an optimal peptide substrate with a serine residue
abolished phosphorylation by LRRK2 []. Furthermore, a number
of detailed studies aimed at mapping LRRK2 autophosphorylation sites have thus far not identified
Ser910 or Ser935, but rather a number of phosphorylated threonine residues
clustered in the LRRK2 Roc-COR domain [–]. A global phosphoproteomic study of a melanoma tumour
identified phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser935 as one of 5600 phosphorylation sites
catalogued on 2250 proteins, but this was not investigated further [].

There is significant similarity in the sequences surrounding Ser910 and
Ser935 suggesting that a single protein kinase may phosphorylate both of these residues
[]. An implication of our finding that LRRK2 inhibitors
induce dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 is that the physiological
Ser910/Ser935 kinase may be stimulated by LRRK2. It is also possible that
LRRK2 inhibits the protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates Ser910 and
Ser935. The identity of the Ser910/Ser935 kinase is unclear and
thus far we have treated cells with 33 signal transduction inhibitors and found that these did not
lead to dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 (Supplementary Figure S2). In
future work it will be important to identify the kinase(s) and/or protein phosphatase(s) that act on
Ser910 and Ser935 and to determine whether it is controlled by LRRK2.

We observed that kinase-dead LRRK2 is still partially phosphorylated at Ser910 and
Ser935 when overexpressed in HEK-293 cells (Supplementary Figure S3A at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/430/bj4300405add.htm). It is possible that the downstream
kinase that LRRK2 regulates may still be partially active in HEK-293 cells and thus capable of
phosphorylating the kinase-dead LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 to some extent,
especially over the 24–36 h time period in which expression of LRRK2 was induced. If
this were the case, we would predict that phosphorylation of kinase-dead LRRK2 at Ser910
and Ser935 would not be influenced by LRRK2 inhibitors, as we have not been able to
detect significant levels of endogenous LRRK2 in HEK-293 cells []. Consistent with this, we find that H-1152 and sunitinib LRRK2 inhibitors do not induce
dephosphorylation of kinase-dead LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 (Supplementary
Figure S3B). Moreover, H-1152 did not induce kinase-dead LRRK2 to accumulate within cytoplasmic
pools under conditions whereas the wild-type enzyme accumulated within these pools (Supplementary
Figure S3C). We have also observed that the 2-fold more active LRRK2(G2019S) mutant and wild-type
LRRK2 are phosphorylated to the same extent on Ser910 and Ser935 []. If overexpression of wild-type LRRK2 is sufficient to maximally
stimulate the downstream pathway that regulates phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and
Ser935, this would explain why the more active LRRK2(G2019S) mutant is not phosphorylated
to a greater extent.

How 14-3-3 interaction influences LRRK2 function requires further investigation. Our results
suggest that this interaction does not control LRRK2 protein kinase activity, as mutation of
Ser910 and/or Ser935 does not influence LRRK2 catalytic activity []. Consistent with this, treatment of cells with H-1152 or
sunitinib induced dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 as well as disrupting
14-3-3 binding, but did not affect endogenous LRRK2 kinase activity (). However, the finding that 14-3-3 binding influences the cytoplasmic localization
of LRRK2 has implications for drug therapy as it has been suggested that the cytoplasmic pools that
several non-14-3-3-binding LRRK2 mutants [including LRRK2(R1441C) and LRRK2(Y1699C)] accumulate
within might comprise aggregates of misfolded unstable LRRK2 protein []. In future work it would be important to investigate further whether disruption
of 14-3-3 binding using LRRK2 inhibitors affects LRRK2 stability, as well as interaction with
substrates. It would also be important to undertake more detailed characterization of the
cytoplasmic pools that LRRK2 accumulates in following treatment with LRRK2 inhibitors and to
determine whether these structures do indeed comprise pools of misfolded LRRK2 protein.

Our finding that all of the structurally diverse LRRK2 inhibitors tested to date induce
dephosphorylation of Ser910 and Ser935 suggests that the physiological
Ser910/Ser935 kinase and/or phosphatase is somehow regulated by LRRK2 and that
LRRK2 might function as an upstream protein kinase. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of
LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 may function as a regulatory feedback network.
Similar regulatory feedback loops operate in many other signal transduction pathways, where a
downstream kinase phosphorylates an upstream component of the signal transduction pathway. For
example, in the ERK signalling pathway ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylate the upstream MEK [MAPK
(mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK kinase] protein kinase [], whereas RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) a kinase that is activated by ERK, phosphorylates and
inhibits mSOS (mammalian Son of sevenless), the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor for Ras []. In the PI3K pathway, S6K1 (S6 kinase 1) phosphorylates
upstream components such as IRS (insulin receptor substrate) adaptors [] and Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR) [] to regulate the pathway. These regulatory feedback loops are inherent features
of signal transduction pathways and play vital roles in modulating the extent and duration of
signalling networks.

In  we present a model by which phosphorylation of
Ser910 and Ser935 is dependent upon LRRK2 activity and hence mediates binding
to 14-3-3 isoforms. We propose that monitoring LRRK2 phosphorylation at
Ser910/Ser935 and/or 14-3-3 binding, and/or cytoplasmic localization of LRRK2,
can be utilized as a cell-based read-out to evaluate the relative potency of LRRK2 inhibitors. These
assays could be deployed in cell lines, tissues of animals or humans treated with LRRK2 inhibitors.
Our results show that LRRK2 inhibitors induced dephosphorylation and disrupted 14-3-3 binding to
endogenous LRRK2 from patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (). This indicates that, for human patients administered LRRK2 inhibitors, the
phosphorylation status of LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 in blood cells could be
employed as a biomarker of LRRK2 inhibitor activity. To our knowledge, the present paper describes
the first approach that could be exploited to develop a simple cell-based system to assess the
efficacy of LRRK2 protein kinase inhibitors. Our findings will also stimulate future work aimed at
understanding how Ser910 and Ser935 phosphorylation is regulated by protein
kinase(s) or phosphatase(s) and the role that LRRK2 plays in influencing feedback phosphorylation of
these residues. It would be fascinating to explore whether the Ser910/Ser935
protein kinase and/or phosphatase enzymes might also comprise a drug target for the treatment of
Parkinson's disease. Finally, it will be vital to work out how 14-3-3 affects LRRK2 function and
whether this is relevant to understanding the role of LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease.

Proposed model of how LRRK2 controls Ser910 and Ser935 phosphorylation
leading to 14-3-3 binding
Our data suggest that LRRK2 functions as an upstream component of a signal transduction pathway
that either directly or indirectly stimulates the activity of a protein kinase or inhibits the
activity of a protein phosphatase that acts on Ser910 and Ser935. This enables
LRRK2 to interact with 14-3-3 isoforms and stabilizes diffuse cytoplasmic localization of LRRK2.
Treatment of cells with LRRK2 inhibitors thus leads to dephosphorylation of Ser910 and
Ser935 and dissociation of 14-3-3. Our findings indicate that LRRK2 phosphorylation of
Ser910 and Ser935 as well as 14-3-3 binding could be employed as a biomarker
to benchmark efficacy of LRRK2 inhibitors that are being developed.
