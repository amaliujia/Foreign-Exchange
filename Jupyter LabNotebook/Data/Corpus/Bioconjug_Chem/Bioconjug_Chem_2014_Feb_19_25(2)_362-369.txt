Introduction
Fluorescence molecular cancer imaging
is gaining momentum as a
method to assist surgeons and endoscopists to identify small foci
of disease during procedures., To date, most conventional
optical imaging has relied on monochromatic, visible range, and “always
on” contrast agents, which emit a single wavelength of light
whether or not they are bound to the target. This approach suffers
from high background signals and diminished sensitivity.− In contrast, activatable probes are turned on, only when they bind
to their target resulting in much higher target-to-background ratios.

Although near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence emission is advantageous
in in vivo fluorescence imaging due to superior light
penetration and low autofluorescence from the biological tissue,, multichromatic NIR fluorescence imaging is more difficult to achieve
than fluorescence imaging in the visible wavelength range because
physical energy differences are smaller in the NIR range making color
separation of each emission spectrum more difficult. A desirable property
of organic NIR fluorophores is that they are relatively small molecules
to permit better biodistribution even after conjugating with targeting
ligands. For instance, although quantum dots are highly efficient
NIR fluorophores yielding multiple different emissions with a single
excitation light and a large Stokes shift, they are too large to label targeting moieties binding to specific
molecules. However, in order to perform multichromatic NIR fluorescence
imaging with conventional organic fluorophores, which have a small
Stokes shift, a little complicated multiexcitation spectral technique
should be employed using a special camera system with a special algorism for calculation.,

In this study, we describe
two newly synthesized NIR fluorescence
probes based on a bacteriochlorin platform, NMP4 and NMP5, which can
be excited with a single green light but emits distinct wavelengths
of NIR light with light strength similar to that of NIR quantum dots.
When NMP4 and NMP5 were conjugated with galactosyl-human serum albumin
(hGSA) or glucosyl-human serum albumin (glu-HSA), and the fluorophores
were quenched until they were released and thereby activated after
cellular internalization.

NMP4 and NMP5 are synthetic bacteriochlorin
derivatives. Bacteriochlorins
are tetrapyrrolic macrocycles, that constitute the core of the photosynthetic
pigments in photosynthetic bacteria− and exhibit an intensive
emission in the NIR spectral window (716–823 nm, with the quantum
yields ranging from 0.04 to 0.25). The
emission band is relatively narrow (with full-width-at-half-maximum
ranging from 17 to 26 nm), and the peak can be precisely tuned by
a simple substitution on the macrocycle periphery., Additionally, bacteriochlorins possess multiple excitation bands,
including a band in the NIR (Qy band between 710 and 820 nm) and a Qx band in the visible range (green ∼510–530
nm). Taken together, bacteriochlorins possess a unique set of properties,
which make them well suited for development as fluorophores with a
single excitation wavelength in the green spectral window and narrow,
well-resolved emission bands in NIR. Bacteriochlorins have been already
reported for in vivo fluorescence− and photoacoustic
imaging. Herein, we describe and characterize
a pair of synthetic bacteriochlorins that were used to detect peritoneal
ovarian cancer metastases (POCM), which grew on the surface of the
peritoneal membrane in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis
of Bacteriochlorins
NMP4-NHS
A mixture of NMP4-Me (14 mg, 26 μmol), aqueous NaOH solution
(2 mL, 2M), THF (4
mL), and methanol (2 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 12 h.
HCl solution (10 mL, 1M) was added. The resulting mixture was extracted
with ethyl acetate. Combined organic layers were washed with brine,
dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated to afford a
crude acid (19 mg, 100%). The resulting acid was treated with DMAP
(12 mg, 100 μmol) and N-hydroxysuccinimide
(30 mg, 261 μmol) in DMF (1 mL), followed by EDC (19 mg, 100
μmol). After 16 h, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate,
washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated.

A mixture of NMP5-Me (16.5 mg, 24 μmol), aqueous NaOH solution (2 mL, 2M), THF

Synthesis, Chemical Activation, and Stability
in Serum of hGSA-NMP
Conjugates
hGSA (250 μg, 3.5 nmol) or glu-HSA (250
μg, 3.5 nmol) were incubated with the NMP4-NHS ester (21.6 μg,
35 nmol) or NMP5-NHS ester (26.7 μg, 35 nmol) in 0.1 M Na2HPO4 (pH8.6) at room temperature for 1 h, followed
by purification with a size exclusion column (PD-10; GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ). The concentrations of each dye in the sample solution
were calculated based on maximum extinction coefficient values of
NMP4 and NMP5, which are 96,000 L/mol/cm at 735 nm and 99,000 L/mol/cm
at 762 nm, respectively, by measuring the absorption with a UV–vis
system (8453 Value UV–vis system; Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA) using 1-cm width of cuvettes. The protein concentration
was also determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm with a UV–vis
system. The number of fluorophore molecules conjugated with each hGSA
or glu-HSA molecule was confirmed by dividing the dye concentration
by the protein concentration.

The quenching abilities of each
conjugate were investigated by denaturing each with 1% SDS as described
previously., Briefly, the conjugates were
incubated either with 1% SDS in PBS or PBS alone for 15 min at room
temperature. The change in fluorescence intensity of NMP4 and NMP5
was investigated with an in vivo imaging system (Maestro,
CRi Inc., Woburn, MA) using the following filter set: 503–555
nm for excitation light and long-pass filter over 700 or 750 nm for
emission light.

Each probe was added to mouse serum collected
from female nude
mice (National Cancer Institute Animal Production Facility, Frederick,
MD), and the serum samples were incubated at 37 °C for 0, 0.5,
1, and 1.5 h. After incubation, the change in fluorescence intensity
was evaluated with a Maestro camera.

Cell Culture
The
established ovarian cancer cell line,
SHIN3, was used for in vitro fluorescence microscopy
and in vivo optical imaging of POCM. SHIN3 DsRed,
in which the red fluorescent protein (RFP DsRed2)-expressing plasmid
(Clontech Laboratories) was previously transfected, served as the
standard of reference for cancer location. Cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 0.03% l-glutamine at 37 °C,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in 5% CO2.

Fluorescence Microscopy Studies
SHIN3 cells (1 ×
104) were plated on a cover glass bottomed culture well
and incubated for 16 h. hGSA-NMP4, hGSA-NMP5, glu-HSA-NMP4, and glu-HSA-NMP5
were then added at 1 μg/mL. The cells were incubated for either
1 or 8 h followed by washing once with PBS, and fluorescence microscopy
was performed using an Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus America, Inc.,
Melville, NY) equipped with the following filters: excitation wavelength
672.5–747.5 nm and emission wavelength range 765–855
nm. Transmitted light differential interference contrast (DIC) images
were obtained as well. To validate the specific binding of the probe,
100 μg of nonconjugated hGSA of glu-HSA was added to block 1
μg of conjugates.

Animal Model of Peritoneal Metastases
All procedures
were carried out in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animal Resources (1996), US National Research Council,
and were approved by the local Animal Care and Use Committee. Six
to eight-week-old female homozygote athymic nude mice were purchased
from Charles River (National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Intraperitoneal
xenografts were established by i.p. injection of 2 × 106 SHIN3 cells suspended in 200 μL of PBS into the peritoneal
cavity of nude mice. Imaging was performed at 14–21 days after
injection of the cells.

In Vivo Activatable Imaging
A mixture
of (i) hGSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5 or (ii) hGSA-NMP5 and glu-HSA-NMP4
(each 25 μg) was injected into the peritoneal cavities of SHIN3
tumor bearing mice (n ≥ 3 for each group).
Mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation 1 h after the i.p.
injection of each probe. After euthanasia, the mouse abdominal wall
was excised, and the abdominal cavity was exposed. Optical images
of the whole abdomen were first obtained. Following this, the small
bowel mesentery was extracted, and close-up images were obtained.
Spectral fluorescence images were acquired using the Maestro In-Vivo Imaging System. The following filter set was used
for imaging NMP4 and NMP5: a band-pass filter from 503 to 555 nm for
excitation light and a long-pass filter over 700 nm for emission light.
The tunable emission filter was automatically stepped in 10 nm increments
from 650 to 950 nm at constant exposure to generate a spectral image.
The spectral fluorescence images consist of autofluorescence spectra
and the spectra from NMP4 and NMP5, which were then unmixed, based
on their spectral patterns using commercial software (Maestro software;
CRi).

Assessment of Sensitivity and Specificity of hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5
in the Detection of Peritoneal Metastases
To examine the
sensitivity and specificity of hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5 for imaging
peritoneal disseminated cancer foci, hGSA-NMP4 or hGSA-NMP5 (each
25 μg) was injected into the peritoneal cavities of RFP-transfected
SHIN3 tumor bearing mice (n ≥ 3 for each group).
Mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide 1.5 h after i.p. injection
of each probe. After euthanasia, the abdominal walls were exposed
and were placed side by side on a nonfluorescent plate. Whole abdominal
images as well as close-up images of the small bowel mesenteries were
obtained. The small bowel mesenteries were extracted and spread out
side by side on the nonfluorescent plate. Spectral fluorescence images
were acquired using the Maestro camera. The following filter set was
used: a band-pass filter from 503 to 555 nm for excitation light and
two filters over 645 and 700 nm for emission light. The tunable emission
filter was automatically stepped in 10 nm increments from 600 to 900
nm at constant exposure. The spectral fluorescence images consisting
of spectra from RFP, NMP4, and NMP5 were then unmixed so that individual
images of each channel were obtained.

Sensitivity and specificity
were determined by comparing sites of fluorescence from hGSA-NMP4
and hGSA-NMP5 with sites of fluorescence from RFP-transfected SHIN3
tumors. The spectral fluorescence images were unmixed, and regions
of interest (ROI) were assigned using automated software based on
a predetermined threshold. Only nodules with short axis diameters
&gt;0.8 mm were included for analysis. RFP-positive nodules were defined
as having an average fluorescence intensity &gt;25 a.u. on images
unmixed
for the RFP spectra. True positives for hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5 were
defined as ROIs with an average fluorescence intensity of &gt;3 a.u,
whereas true negatives for hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5 were defined as
ROIs with an average fluorescence intensity &lt;3 a.u. on the spectrally
unmixed images. False positives for hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5 were defined
as ROIs in which fluorescence was seen only on the NMP4 or NMP5 image
and not on the RFP image.

Results
Synthesis
Several bioconjugatable bacteriochlorin derivatives
have been reported previously.,− The synthesis of NMP4-NHS and NMP5-NHS, which include a bioconjugatable N-hydroxysuccinimide moiety, is outlined in Figure A. The synthesis of the requisite methyl esters
NMP4-Me and NMP5-Me was achieved by regioselective palladium-catalyzed
derivatization of corresponding dibromobacteriochlorin and has been
reported previously. The methyl esters
in NMP4-Me and NMP5-Me were hydrolyzed (2 M aqueous NaOH, in THF/MeOH)
to provide the corresponding crude acid. TLC analysis showed complete
consumption of the starting material and essentially the quantitative
formation of the acids. The crude acids were reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide in the presence of EDC and DMAP, in
DMF, to provide NMP4-NHS and NMP5-NHS
in 68% and 43% yields, respectively.

Synthesis of NMP4-NHS and NMP5-NHS (A).
Chemical structures of
the NMP4-NHS ester (B) and the NMP5-NHS ester (C) and their absorption
(blue line) and emission (black line) profiles. Both dyes have two
available excitation peaks in green and NIR wavelengths and yield
NIR emission (739 and 770 nm for NMP4 and NMP5 in dimethylsulfoxide,
respectively) by exciting green or NIR light.

Optical Characteristics of NMP4 or NMP5 Conjugated Probes
NMP4 and NMP5 have absorption spectra, typical for bacteriochlorin
derivatives., Thus, in DMSO NMP4-NHS and NMP5-NHS
exhibit strong B bands in UV (368 and 370 nm), a Qx band in the green range (509
and 523 nm), and a Qy band in the NIR range (727 and 753 nm). The molar extinction coefficients
were determined in DMSO and for NMP4-NHS are 1.2 × 105 cm–1·M–1 (367 nm), 3.5
× 104 cm–1·M–1 (509 nm), and 9.6 × 104 cm–1·M–1 (727 nm), and for NMP5-NHS are 1.1 × 105 cm–1·M–1 (370 nm),
3.1 × 104 cm–1·M–1 (523 nm), and 9.9 × 104 cm–1·M–1 (753 nm). The absorption features of bacteriochlorins
arise from the multiple π–π* transitions and can
be explained on the basis of the four-orbital Gouterman’s model,
which was previously discussed in detail (see ref () and references cited therein).
Both NMP4 and NMP5 emit at a NIR peak of 739 and 770 nm, respectively,
regardless of the wavelength of excitation (Figure C). The quantum yields were previously determined for NMP4-Me
and NMP5-Me are 0.22 and 0.20 (NMP4-Me), and 0.25 and 0.21 (NMP5-Me),
in toluene and DMF, respectively. The
number of NMP4 and NMP5 dyes conjugated with hGSA and glu-HSA was
2.5 ± 0.4, 2.3 ± 0.3, 2.9 ± 0.2, and 2.3 ± 0.3
for hGSA-NMP4, hGSA-NMP5, glu-HSA-NMP4, and glu-HSA-NMP5, respectively.
The quenching capacities measured by adding 1% SDS to each probe were
more than 100 for all probes (Figure A). Since
the absorbance spectra of hGSA-NMP4, hGSA-NMP5, glu-HSA-NMP4, and
glu-HSA-NMP5 were identical before and after dequenching with 1% SDS
(, Figure 3), fluorescence
signals of these agents were most likely quenched based on the fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism. No measurable dequenching
(∼5%) of each probe was observed in mouse serum at 37 °C
for 1.5 h (Figure B), demonstrating high in vivo stability.

(A) Fluorescence signals of probes synthesized
in this study with
or without chemical activation by adding 1% SDS. All probes showed
high activation ratios (more than 100). (B) Stability of probes in
mouse serum. Fluorescence recovery was calculated by the following
equation: (fluorescence signal in mouse serum – fluorescence
signal in PBS)/(fluorescence signal in SDS/PBS – fluorescence
signal in PBS) × 100. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
Each probe exhibited high stability in mouse serum for 1.5 h.

In Vitro Fluorescent Characterization of Probes
In the microscopy
studies (Figure ), many
bright intracellular foci were present after 8 h of incubation with
hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5, while the signal was minimal at 1 h after
incubation because of the robust quenching magnitude. These signals
were partially blocked by the addition of excess hGSA. However, a
low signal was detected in SHIN3 cells for glu-HSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5
even after 8 h of incubation.

Fluorescence microscopy studies. SHIN3 cells
were incubated with
hGSA-NMP4, hGSA-NMP5, glu-HSA-NMP4, and glu-HSA-NMP5 for 1 and 8 h.
Although hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5 minimally accumulated in SHIN3 cells
at 1 h, many bright spots were seen within SHIN3 cells after 8 h of
incubation, which was partially blocked by excess hGSA. The accumulation
of glu-HSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5 was lower than that of hGSA conjugates.

In Vivo Dual Probe Activatable Imaging
hGSA-NMP4 or hGSA-NMP5 was
injected into the peritoneal cavities
of SHIN3 tumor bearing mice. The side-by-side images of hGSA-NMP4
and hGSA-NMP5 showed that the fluorescence signals can be distinguished in vivo by spectral unmixing with the fluorescence pattern
of NMP4 and NMP5 (Figure A). Although similar
results were obtained using glu-HSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5, the signal
intensities were lower than hGSA-based probes (Figure B), which was consistent with our previous data ()

(A) Side-by-side images of SHIN3 tumor bearing mice i.p.
administered
with hGSA-NMP4 or hGSA-NMP5. The fluorescence signal of NMP4 (blue)
and NMP5 (green) was unmixed with their spectral library. Both probes
clearly visualized SHIN3 tumors in vivo in the mesentery
with minimal background signal. (B) Side-by-side images of SHIN3 tumor
bearing mice i.p. injected with glu-HSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5. (C)
A mixture of hGSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5 was injected i.p. into SHIN3
tumor bearing mice. The fluorescence signals derived from NMP4 and
NMP5 colocalized with the tumor in the mesentery. (D) A mixture of
hGSA-NMP5 and glu-HSA-NMP4 was injected i.p. into SHIN3 tumor bearing
mice.

Upon administration of the mixture
of hGSA-NMP4 and glu-HSA-NMP5,
the colocalization of fluorescence signal derived from NMP4 and NMP5
was observed (Figure C).

Sensitivity
and Specificity of hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5
The side-by-side
whole abdominal images of RFP-transfected SHIN3
cells with hGSA-NMP4 and with hGSA-NMP5 showed that the fluorescence
signals can be distinguished in vivo by spectral
acquisition and unmixing with a resulting fluorescence pattern of
RFP, NMP4, and NMP5 (Figure A). The side-by-side
mesenteric images of RFP-transfected SHIN3 cells with hGSA-NMP4 and
with hGSA-NMP5 demonstrated that NMP4 and NMP5 were mostly coincident
with RFP positive foci. The sensitivity and specificity of hGSA-NMP4
and hGSA-NMP5 for detecting SHIN3-DsRed tumors are depicted in Figure B. Sixty-six foci showed hGSA-NMP4 fluorescence
among the 94 RFP-positive foci, while 20 foci showed hGSA-NMP4 fluorescence
with intensity &gt;3 a.u. among the 178 RFP-negative foci. Thus, hGSA-NMP4
was found to have a sensitivity of 70.2% (66 out of 94) and a specificity
of 89.9% (158 out of 178). Ninety-five foci showed hGSA-NMP5 fluorescence
among the 132 RFP-positive foci. Eleven foci showed hGSA-NMP4 fluorescence
with intensity &gt;3 a.u. among the 257 RFP-negative foci. Thus, hGSA-NMP5
was found to have a sensitivity of 72.0% (95 out of 132) and a specificity
of 95.9% (246 out of 257).

spectral library. Each probe clearly visualized RFP-transfected SHIN3
tumors. (B) Side-by-side images of extracted mesenteries of mice with

mostly coincident. Sensitivity and specificity of hGSA-NMP4 and hGSA-NMP5
for detecting RFP-transfected SHIN3 foci were calculated by examining
278 and 389 nodules, respectively.

Discussion
We investigated optical probes targeted
to POCM using the glycoprotein,
avidin, () a ligand for lectins similar
to the β-d-galactose receptor, which is generally considered
an “H-type” lectin. Unfortunately, since avidin is a
hen egg protein, its immunogenicity precludes its clinical use. Seeking
alternative lectin-targeted moieties, we subsequently conjugated green
fluorescent dyes, like rhodamine green, to a nonimmunogenic ligand,
hGSA. The hGSA component is highly biocompatible
and binds ovarian cancer with high specificity when administered intraperitoneally.
Furthermore, the d-galactose receptor is an optimal target
for other peritoneal metastases since it is expressed in a wide range
of metastatic cancers. In addition, hGSA
has already been used in Japan as a clinical diagnostic agent in humans
for measuring hepatic reserve. A fluorescent probe based on glu-HSA
is a good control molecule since it does not bind to the d-galactose receptor as well as hGSA. This is because glu-HSA was
synthesized with direct amidation using human serum albumin conjugated
with the same number of glucosamines. Therefore, it is completely
expected that the fluorescent glu-HSA probe showed minimal binding
to the d-galactose receptor expressing SHIN3 cells in vitro (Figure ). However, fluorescence-
and radio-labeled glu-HSA probes showed binding to inflammatory cells
associated with tumor implants in vivo() and accumulated significantly less in both SHIN3
tumors and the liver than hGSA-based probes (see also , Figure 4).

We demonstrate
that it is feasible to image ovarian cancers with
NMP4 and NMP5, representing a new class of NIR fluorophores, when
they are conjugated with hGSA. Both fluorophores are quenched when
conjugated with either hGSA or glu-HSA and showed high activation
ratios (&gt;100) after adding SDS or internalizing into the lysosome in vitro. Therefore, these probes allowed us to achieve in vivo fluorescence imaging with low background signal
at earlier times (1.5 h) after injection compared with conventional
“always on” fluorescence probes.,

Both NMP4 and NMP5 are chemically different from NMP-1, which
we
reported in our previous work. For instance,
NMP-1 has an entirely different emission spectrum compared to those
of NMP4 and NMP5. This class of bacteriochlorin fluorophores can be
highly tuned with regard to its NIR emission spectra making it unique
in comparison to cyanine dyes. Therefore, with NMP-1, NMP4, and NMP5,
we could theoretically perform 3-color NIR fluorescence imaging. However,
since the current spectral camera is not sensitive enough to separate
two distinct spectra with single nanometer difference in the range
from 700 to 800 nm, we could successfully separate only NMP4 and NMP5
and show them in two colors. This low camera sensitivity in the NIR
range technically led to low sensitivity for detecting tumor lesions
because small photon numbers decreased NMP4 or NMP5 signals of tumor
nodules after spectral separation from highly sensitive RFP.

Another advantage of bacteriochlorin-based fluorophores over conventional
organic dyes is that all these probes can be excited with a single
green light, which is completely separate from NIR emissions, thus
minimizing the usual background autofluorescence seen with shorter
Stokes shifts. Since bacteriochlorin-based fluorophores have quite
sharp emission spectra, it should be possible to deliver a cocktail
of 3 or more distinctly targeted probe conjugates to measure multiple
receptors simultaneously all with a single excitation. Improvements
in optical engineering will undoubtedly advance to the point where
a single excitation can result in activation of 3 or more NIR peaks
that can be separately resolved.

In conclusion, we describe
a new activatable, multichromatic pair
of fluorophores, NMP4 and NMP5, which are based on bacteriochlorin.
We successfully performed single excitation, 2-color NIR fluorescence
imaging in vivo. On the basis of the flexibility
of bacteriochlorin-based chemistry, it should be possible to synthesize
additional distinct fluorophores with slightly different emissions.
With anticipated advances in optical engineering, bacteriochlorin-based
fluorophores will allow us to perform a single excitation, multicolor
NIR fluorescence imaging that could show multiple distinct parameters
utilizing much smaller molecules than is possible with quantum dots.
