Immunoassays
have been translated into microfluidic device formats,
but significant challenges relating to upstream sample processing
still limit their applications. Here, stimuli-responsive polymer–antibody
conjugates are utilized in a microfluidic immunoassay to enable rapid
biomarker purification and enrichment as well as sensitive detection.
The conjugates were constructed by covalently grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), a thermally responsive
polymer, to the lysine residues of anti-prostate specific antigen
(PSA) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) using carbodiimide chemistry via the
polymer end-carboxylate. The antibody-PNIPAAm (capture) conjugates
and antibody-alkaline phosphatase (detection) conjugates formed sandwich
immunocomplexes via PSA binding in 50% human plasma. The complexes
were loaded into a recirculating poly(dimethylsiloxane) microreactor,
equipped with micropumps and transverse flow features, for subsequent
separation, enrichment, and quantification. The immunocomplexes were
captured by heating the solution to 39 °C, mixed over the transverse
features for 2 min, and washed with warm buffer. In one approach,
the assay utilized immunocomplex solution that was contained in an
80 nL microreactor, which was loaded with solution at room temperature
and subsequently heated to 39 °C. The assay took 25 min and resulted
in 37 pM PSA limit of detection (LOD), which is comparable to a plate
ELISA employing the same antibody pair. In another approach, the microreactor
was preheated to 39 °C, and immunocomplex solution was flowed
through the reactor, mixed, and washed. When the specimen volume was
increased to 7.5 μL by repeating the capture process three times,
the higher specimen volume led to immunocomplex enrichment within
the microreactor. The resulting assay LOD was 0.5 pM, which is 2 orders
of magnitude lower than the plate ELISA. Both approaches generate
antigen specific signal over a clinically significant range. The sample
processing capabilities and subsequent utility in a biomarker assay
demonstrate the opportunity for stimuli-responsive polymer–protein
conjugates in novel diagnostic technologies.

Introduction
Detection of disease specific protein
biomarkers in human bodily
fluids can provide both diagnostic and prognostic value.1 However, biomarkers are often very dilute in
the complex milieu of human blood.2 Therefore,
current clinical diagnostic strategies are limited to techniques that
require expert-run and time-consuming specimen processing with large
sample volumes to purify and enrich biomarkers prior to assay,3 which are not ideal for many diagnostic settings3a,4 (e.g., global health settings). Combining biomarker separation and
enrichment steps within a rapid and simple assay will overcome these
limitations and enhance the utility of diagnostic assays.5

Microfluidic devices have been utilized
for various applications6 and also offered
the promise of rapid and simple
assays suitable for use in distributed diagnostic settings.7 For example, Delmarche et al. introduced a one-step
point-of-care microfluidic immunoassay, an integrated device with
on-card detection and captured antibodies (Abs) utilized specimen
addition to trigger a sandwich immunoassay powered by capillary forces.8 In another example, Murphy et al. have described
a fluorescence competitive immunoassay for three different antigens
using micromosaic capture Abs that were covalently immobilized in
a mosaic pattern on silicon nitride microfluidic networks.9 While these assays could detect 10–12 M antigen in short assay times (&lt;45 min), their performance is
still limited by fundamental issues—surface bound capture Abs
are unable to fully interrogate the sample volume rapidly due to antigen
transport limitations to and from the surface, and conformational/mobility
restrictions of the surface immobilized Ab.10

We have been investigating the use of stimuli-responsive polymer-Ab
reagent systems10a,11 with complementary microfluidic
devices to overcome some of the basic challenges of the microfluidic
immunoassay. These molecular reagent systems enable efficient and
rapid antigen binding and in situ sandwich immunocomplex assembly
with the secondary labeling reagent in a homogeneous solution such
as plasma.12 The reagent system can facilitate
biomarker/immunocomplex separation, purification, and enrichment13 in microchannels that exhibit hydrophobic14 sidewalls and provide short transport distances
and large surface area to volume ratios.15 Additionally, fluidic controls such as valves,16 pumps,17 and active features18 can be integrated to improve the transport and
capture of the stimuli-responsive polymer-Ab complexes on the channel
surfaces.19 Here, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) has been conjugated to a prostate
specific antigen (PSA) Ab, an Immunoglobulin G (IgG), for purifying
and concentrating the PSA sandwich immunocomplexes in a previously
described circular microreactor with transverse flow generators without
device surface functionalization.17,18b,20 Instead of dialysis,21 the conjugates were purified via ion exchange (IE) chromatography.
In order to assist assay development, the conjugate binding properties
were characterized via a competitive ELISA. In addition to concentrating
immunocomplexes on a PDMS surface, the immunoassay here employs alkaline
phosphatase (AP) to generate a fluorescent signal and generates the
assay signal directly on the assay device. The stimuli-responsive
reagent system and corresponding microreactor can concentrate the
PSA immunocomplexes directly in human plasma with a strong enhancement
of the biomarker specific signal.

Results and Discussion
System
Design
A rapid PSA immunoassay with biomarker
enrichment capability was enabled by using an Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate
in conjunction with a recirculating microreactor module (Scheme 1). The assay started from forming sandwich immunocomplexes
by mixing Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate (capture reagent) and Ab-AP conjugate
(detection reagent) in 50% human plasma, spiked with PSA (antigen).
This binding in a homogeneous solution format has been shown to overcome
mass transport limitations on protein–ligand binding at solid
surfaces.10a,22 The immunocomplexes in the human
plasma specimen were then isolated by utilizing the recirculating
microreactor module above the PNIPAAm transition temperature via the
interactions between the device surface and the collapsed polymer
within the conjugate.23 Compared to our
previous immunoassay work,21 the PSA immunoassay
here is different in assay format, which isolates immunocomplexes
on a PDMS surface, in the detection system, which employs AP to generate
a fluorescent signal, and in the detection procedure, which detects
the assay signal directly within the microfluidic device. We evaluated
two immunoassay approaches, 25 °C starting temperature with finite
(80 nL) specimen volume and 39 °C starting temperature with immunocomplex
enrichment.

Scheme 1 Immunoassay Overview
Immunocomplexes, composed
of Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates, Ab-AP conjugates, and PSA, are formed in
a 50% human plasma solution. Samples are loaded into the microfluidic
device and surface is heated to 39 °C. Above 39 °C,
immunocomplexes are separated from the human plasma solution by immobilization
on the microfluidic device sidewalls through hydrophobic interactions.
To enrich samples, the microfluidic device is washed to remove non-immobilized
material and additional sample is injected with the temperature at
39 °C. Once sample is separated, enzyme substrate is loaded
into the microfluidic device and turned over into fluorescent product
by immobilized Ab-AP conjugates for detection.

PSA Antibody-PNIPAAm Conjugate Synthesis and Characterization
The conjugate was constructed using a protocol similar to that
in our previous publication21 by end-grafting
PNIPAAm chains to Ab’s lysine residues (Scheme 2). The PNIPAAm with an end-carboxylate was synthesized using
thermally initiated reversible addition–fragmentation chain
transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) results show the polymer exhibited Mn = 41.2 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.1. To facilitate
the Ab conjugation, the PNIPAAm end-carboxylate was converted to tetrafluorophenyl
(TFP) active ester.21 TFP was utilized
to reducing hydrolysis rate for improving amine reactivity.24

Scheme 2 RAFT Polymerized PNIPAAm Was Functionalized
with TFP to Create an
Amine Reactive TFP-PNIPAAm Active Ester
Functionalized polymer was
subsequently conjugated to Ab to create an Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate. Conjugates
were purified through a serial combination of thermal precipitation
and ion exchange chromatography.

The conjugation
was carried out by simply mixing TFP-PNIPAAm (in
anhydrous DMSO) with PSA Ab.21 In addition
to desalting and thermal precipitation, we employed IE chromatography
for conjugate purification because PNIPAAm is neutral, and therefore
facilitates the protein–polymer conjugate to be selectively
captured and released from the IE resin. The purification process
was monitored using a UV–vis spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis
(Figure 1). UV–vis spectrum of the conjugation
reaction solution, RXN (Figure 1a, purple),
exhibited absorbance peaks near 280 and 307 nm, which indicate the
solution contains both Ab and PNIPAAm (trithiocarbonate CTA). After
the conjugation, the solution was processed first with a desalting
column to remove small molecule impurities, and then with thermal
precipitation to separate native Ab (without polymer) in the solution
by pelleting both Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates and excess PNIPAAm. UV–vis
spectrum of the supernatant from thermal precipitation, Supernate
(Figure 1a, green), exhibited a peak absorbance
around 280 nm, which confirmed the solution contains mainly native
Ab, IgG (Figure 1a, blue). The resuspended
pellet, Pellet (Figure 1a, red), exhibited
a broad absorbance around 307 nm. Figure 1c
shows the resuspended pellet solution (Lane 2) with smear pattern
and shifted toward higher molecular weight than native Ab, IgG (Lane
6), which confirmed the conjugation.

The pellet solution was
further processed with IE chromatography
to purify the Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates by removing excess PNIPAAm. Both
IE effluent and wash (Figure 1c, Lane 3 and
4) did not contain conjugates but consisted mostly of PNIPAAm, as
seen by strong 307 nm absorbance of trithiocarbonate CTA (Figure 1b, red and green), which suggests that dimethylaminopropyl
resins successfully retained Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates. The released conjugates,
Conjugate (Figure 1b, purple), exhibited a
280 nm absorbance peak with a PNIPAAm trithiocarbonate CTA shoulder,
307 nm, which confirms the conjugate contains both Ab and PNIPAAm.
Figure 1c shows the released conjugate (Lane
5) also with a smear pattern with molecular weight higher than the
native Ab, IgG (Lane 6), which confirms the IE chromatography successfully
isolated Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates and removed excess polymer by washing.
These results confirm the Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates were successfully
purified.

spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis. (a) UV–vis spectra
for the thermal precipitation process. The conjugation reaction solution,
RXN (a, purple), exhibited absorbance near 280 and 307 nm, which indicates
the solution contains both antibody and PNIPAAm (trithiocarbonate
CTA). After the thermal precipitation, the spectrum of the supernatant,
Supernate (a, green), exhibited a peak absorbance around 280 nm, which
confirmed the solution contains mainly IgG (a, blue). The resuspended
pellet, Pellet (a, red), exhibited a broad absorbance around 307 nm.
(b) UV–vis spectra for the IE chromatography process. The spectrum

307 nm, which confirms the IE chromatography successfully isolated
Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates via dimethylaminopropyl resin and removed excess
polymer by washing as the ion exchange (IE) effluent (red) and wash
(green) consist mostly of PNIPAAm, as seen by strong 307 nm absorbance
of trithiocarbonate CTA. (c) Gel electrophoresis results: Lane 1,

conjugate; Lane 6, IgG. The resuspended pellet solution (Lane 2) exhibit
a smear pattern that shifted toward higher molecular weight than native
IgG (Lane 6) confirms the conjugation. The results also confirm ion
exchange chromatography successfully isolated Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates
via dimethylaminopropyl resin because released conjugate (Lane 5)
exhibits a smear pattern on the gel with molecular weight higher than
the native IgG (Lane 6) and IE effluent (Lane 3) and wash (Lane 4)
did not contain conjugates (PNIPAAm does not stain).

In order to assist assay development, we evaluated
the effect of
polymer conjugation on Ab-antigen equilibrium binding via a competitive
binding assay using 96-well PSA ELISA. In this assay, PSA (300 pM
final concentration in PBS) was premixed with either native Ab, or
Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates at 30, 300, 3000, or 30000 pM final concentration
in PBS. After 15 min, these solutions were subjected to the 96-well
ELISA protocol. The native Ab, Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate, and capture Ab
in ELISA were the same monoclonal IgG that bind PSA at the identical
epitope. Therefore, the 96-well ELISA was utilized to quantify unbound
PSA at equilibrium in the solutions of native Abs (or Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates).
As a control, PSA was incubated without native Ab (or Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate).
The control allowed the quantification of signal for total PSA. Assuming
total PSA equals the sum of unbound and bound PSA, the bound PSA was
estimated by subtracting unbound PSA from total PSA.

Figure 2 shows bound PSA at equilibrium
for various native Ab (or Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate) concentrations. The
bound PSA increased with increasing concentration of native Ab (or
Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate). Dashed lines are fittings via one site total
binding model, which was also used to estimate KD values (GraphPad Prism). With our in-house ELISA, the native
Ab (blue) KD is 1.192 nM, and the KD for Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates (red) is 1.599 nM.
Compared to the native Ab, binding via Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates was lower
at the same molar excess. However, our new stimuli-responsive reagent
system enabled PSA binding similar to the native Ab by using more
conjugates. Therefore, the downstream assay performance was not compromised.

conjugate (red). Error bars are standard deviations over three independent
experiments. Dashed lines are fittings via one site total binding
model, which was also used to estimate KD values (GraphPad Prism). The native Ab (blue) KD is 1.192 nM, and the KD for
Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates (red) is 1.599 nM.

PSA Immunoassay in the Microreactor
The PSA immunoassay
utilized a microreactor to efficiently isolate sandwich immunocomplexes
containing Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates within the recirculator via heating.
We first evaluated the ability of our system to generate antigen specific
signal over a clinically significant range by capturing the immunocomplexes
from 80 nL of 50% human plasma spiked with 0, 150, 210, and 300 pM
PSA.25 The human plasma dilution was meant
to precondition specimens for minimizing variation across specimens
and alleviating nonspecific protein interactions with capture surfaces.26 The immunoassay was carried out using the microfluidic
immunoassay protocol illustrated in Scheme 3 and detailed in the Experimental Procedures section below. During the sample preparation step, the sandwich
immunocomplexes were assembled in a homogeneous solution by mixing
Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate (capture reagent) and Ab-AP conjugate (detection
reagent) in 50% human plasma, spiked with PSA (antigen). After the
microreactor was filled with immunocomplex solution and sealed (sample
loading), the reactor was heated to 39 °C (heating). Heating
above the transition temperature caused the PNIPAAm to phase transition
from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, which leads to immocomplex precipitation
and immobilization on the PDMS surface. Circulating the contained
specimen (separation) brought precipitated complexes into contact
with the PDMS surface, maximizing immunocomplex separation.20 After a buffer wash at 39 °C, 4-MUP substrate
was loaded (substrate loading) into the device for generating fluorescent
signal via the assay’s alkaline phosphatase (AP) detection
conjugates. Additional circulation at 25 °C was employed during
image acquisition to homogenize the captured immunocomplexes with
the 4-MUP substrate while subsequently homogenizing the fluorescent
product, methylumbelliferone (substrate development). Fluorescence
images were acquired over 15 min and were analyzed using ImageJ to
measure the fluorescent intensity in the microchannel.27 Normalized fluorescence intensity was calculated
by first measuring the fluorescence intensity in the channel, which
was then normalized to the native fluorescence of PDMS.

Scheme 3 Process
for PSA Immunoassay with 80 nL Specimen Volume
Sample Prep: form sandwich
immunocomplexes in a homogeneous solution by mixing Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate
(capture reagent) and Ab-AP conjugate (detection reagent) in 50% human
plasma, spiked with PSA (antigen). Sample loading: fill microreactor
with immunocomplex solution. Heating: raise the device temperature
to 39 °C, which transitions sandwich immunocomplexes with
Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates to be hydrophobic. Separation: capture immunocomplexes
on the surface by circulating the contained specimens. Washing: remove
excess detection reagent and other serum proteins via buffer wash.
Substrate Loading: load 4-MUP substrate into the reactor. Substrate
Development: lower the device temperature to 25 °C and
activate the circulation to mix immunocomplexes with substrate for
generating signal.

Figure 3 shows the normalized fluorescence
intensity increased linearly with signal development time for each
antigen concentration, indicating immunocomplexes were successfully
immobilized on the microreactor surface. All assay evaluations show
a strong linear correlation with R2 values
between 0.96 and 0.99. The slope increased from 0.0099 to 0.0492 when
the PSA concentration changed from 0 to 303 pM. At the end of the
assay (15 min) specimens with spiked PSA show significantly higher
fluorescence intensity than 0 pM specimen.

Figure 3 Results of immunoassays
with 80 nL specimen volume. The fluorescence
intensity increased with time for each antigen concentration measured.
The slope increased with increasing antigen concentration as expected.
Dashed lines are linear fits to the data and error bars are standard
deviations over three independent experiments. Data points are for
0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 min only.

For a given PSA concentration, utilizing larger specimen
volume
provides higher numbers of PSA molecules, which results in more immunocomplexes.
Therefore, efficiently concentrating immunocomplexes from larger specimen
volume leads to higher assay signal (fluorescent intensity) and the
resulting assay might exhibit a lower limit of detection (LOD), which
can improve the assay sensitivity. Therefore, we applied the enrichment
process to larger specimen volumes, 2.5 and 7.5 μL. We have
previously demonstrated the analyte enrichment process via PNIPAAm
conjugates using streptavidin as a model marker.20 Here the enrichment process was applied to the PSA sandwich
immunocomplexes, which enable direct analyte detection in the microfluidic
device via the detection reagent. The immunoassay with enrichment
process is illustrated in Scheme 4, which is
similar to the assay with finite volume. Instead of starting the assay
with the device at 25 °C, this approach began with the device
preheated to 39 °C prior to sample loading, which is above the
conjugate transition temperature. Flowing immunocomplexes into a preheated
device increased the volume of specimen exposed to immuocomplex capture
conditions. After separation and washing, the new assay system can
either proceed with substrate loading for detection or allow additional
sample loadings, which can significantly increase the number of captured
immunocomplexes to improve analyte detection.

Scheme 4 Process for PSA Immunoassay
with Enrichment Process
This process utilizes
a device
that has been preheated to 39 °C prior to sample loading
to transition sandwich immunocomplexes with Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates
to be hydrophobic during sample loading. Sample Prep: form sandwich
immunocomplexes in a homogeneous solution by mixing Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate
(capture reagent) and Ab-AP conjugate (detection reagent) in 50% human
plasma, spiked with PSA (antigen). Sample loading: fill microreactor
with immunocomplex solution. Separation: capture immunocomplexes on
the microfluidic channel surface by circulating the contained specimens.
Washing: remove other excess detection reagent and other serum proteins
via buffer wash. Substrate Loading: load 4-MUP substrate into the
reactor. Substrate Development: lower the device temperature to 25 °C
and activate the circulation to mix immunocomplexes with substrate
for generating signal.

These experiments utilized
50% human plasma spiked with 0, 30,
and 150 pM PSA to mimic the clinical relevant range.25 One sample load consisted of flowing 2.5 μL spiked
human plasma through the microreactor at 39 °C. Then, the aforementioned
protocol was used to capture the immunocomplexes and generate fluorescent
signal. The fluorescence images and their analysis are the same as
the assay with finite volume.27 These experiments
utilized both one (2.5 μL) and three sample (3 × 2.5 μL)
loads. Figure 4 shows the normalized fluorescence
intensity (using the same calculation as in Figure 3) increased linearly with substrate development time for each
antigen concentration in both 2.5 and 7.5 μL assays, indicating
that immunocomplexes were successfully immobilized on the PDMS surface.
All assay evaluations show a strong linear correlation with R2 values between 0.95 and 0.98. When the PSA
concentration changed from 0 to 152 pM, the slope increased from 0.0088
to 0.0585 for 2.5 μL assays and from 0.216 to 0.1386 for 7.5
μL assays. At the end of assay (15 min) specimens with spiked
PSA show significantly higher fluorescence intensity than those with
0 pM specimen.

Figure 4 Results of immunoassays with larger specimen volume. The
fluorescence
intensity increased with time for each antigen concentration measured.
Increasing the volume of sample loaded from (a) 2.5 μL to (b)
7.5 μL resulted in a modest increase in the rate of production
for the null sample, while antigen containing sample increased significantly,
thus decreasing the limit of detection. Dashed lines are linear fits
to the data and error bars are standard deviations over three independent
experiments. Data points are for 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 min only.

Figure 5 shows the correlation between rate
of fluorescence production and antigen concentration. The rate of
fluorescence production is the calculated slope of normalized fluorescence
intensity versus time from Figures 3 and 4. The rate of fluorescence production increased
with antigen concentration, indicating immunocomplexes were successfully
immobilized on the microreactor surface. For a given antigen concentration,
the rate of fluorescence production increased with the number of specimen
loads, indicating immunocomplexes were being enriched on the microfluidic
device surface. All assay evaluations show a strong linear correlation
with R2 values between 0.91 and 0.99.
The slope of linear fit changed from 0.000 300 to 0.000 711
when the specimen volume increased from 2.5 to 7.5 μL. The signals
for 0 pM PSA specimens were very similar for the assays using 80 nL
and 2.5 μL, but was ∼2-fold higher for the assay using
7.5 μL, which might be caused by nonspecific immobilization
of the detection reagent to the PDMS surface.28 For the assays with 150 pM PSA, the rate was 0.126 fluorescence
units/min for 7.5 μL assay which was 6.4-fold higher than 80
nL and 2.3-fold higher than 2.5 μL evaluations. The increase
in rate of fluorescence production for the 7.5 μL specimen was
due to the increase in immunocomplexes present in the larger sample
volume and due, presumably, to improved transport conditions in the
channel. As immunocomplexes were immobilized on the channel wall,
the channel cross section became occluded, reducing the distance from
the channel centerline to the effective capture surface thus enabling
an increase in the rate of immobilization at the expense of increased
back pressure. Therefore, the assay signal was significantly higher.

Figure 5 Rate of
fluorescence production for immunoassays with finite volume
(80 nL) and enrichment processes (2.5 and 7.5 μL). A linear
relationship between rate of fluorescence production and antigen concentration
was observed for all assays. In immunoassays with the enrichment process,
increasing loaded volume from 2.5 to 7.5 μL showed a marked
increase in rate of fluorescence production for a given antigen concentration,
demonstrating enrichment on the microfluidic channel sidewalls. Dashed
lines are linear fits to the data and error bars are standard deviations
over three independent experiments.

The data in Figure 5 were also utilized
for estimating assays’ LOD, which is the antigen concentration
for generating rate of fluorescence production = Rave + 3RstdevRave is the average rate of fluorescence production and Rstdev is the resulting standard deviation that
were calculated using three independent 0 pM PSA samples. The calculated
LOD for the microfluidic immunoassays are summarized in Table 1. For comparison purposes Table 1 also summarizes three FDA approved commercial PSA immunoassays,
including the Elecsys test (Roche), Immuno-1 test (Bayer), and the
Immulite test (Diagnostic Products Corporation). The values for sample
volume and limit of detection were taken from product literature and
relevant clinical evaluations.29

The calculated LOD for the 80 nL immunoassay was 37 pM, which is
comparable to plate based ELISA (43 pM) but the assay only took 25
min. The new assay system can generate antigen specific signal over
clinical relevant concentrations with an 80 nL specimen (ca. 2 ×
106 PSA molecules), which is approximately 3 orders of
magnitude less than ELISA because the combination of Ab-PNIPAAm conjugates
and microreacator enable highly efficient and rapid sandwich immunocomplex
separation. The calculated LOD for 2.5 μL assay was 22 pM, which
was similar to the plate. However, the estimated LOD was 0.5 pM for
7.5 μL assay, which was a 2 orders of magnitude improvement
from the plate ELISA. 7.5 μL assays provide significantly more
PSA molecules than 80 nL and 2.5 μL assays, which led to the
antigen dependent increase in signal required to detect low antigen
concentrations. Compared to FDA approved PSA immunoassays, our microfluidic
immunoassay takes a similar amount of time to complete but consumes
lower specimen volume. While our microfluidic immunoassay exhibits
higher LOD in concentration, our assay system shows comparable LOD
in number of antigen molecules because our assay system can efficiently
capture immunocomplexes from a smaller specimen volume.

However,
comparison with the commercialized PSA detection kits
is very challenging because these kits are optimized with different
antibody pairs and detection systems, including enzymes, substrates,
and instruments. Antibody is the key reagent that dictates the immunoassay
performance. Assay manufacturers would focus on developing antibodies
with the best binding properties (e.g., kon, koff), which may be significantly better
than the antibodies used in our assay. Additionally, these kits are
utilized in conjunction with instruments that are optimized for their
assays. Therefore, a direct comparison should not be based on few
values.

Overall, the results indicate that the microfluidic
immunoassay
with finite specimen volume, heated from room temperature and captured,
can be employed to measure antigen concentration over a finite range,
while larger sample volumes flown into a preheated device can facilitate
immunocomplex concentration and subsequent detection of dilute antigen
concentrations.

a The calculated LOD for the 80
nL immunoassay was 37 pM, which is comparable to plate based ELISA
(43 pM) but the assay only took 25 min. The new assay system can enable
highly efficient and rapid sandwich immunocomplex separation to generate
antigen specific signal with an 80 nL specimen (ca. 2 × 106 PSA molecules), which is approximately 3 orders of magnitude
less than plate ELISA. The calculated LOD for 2.5 μL assay was
22 pM, which was similar to the plate. However, the estimated LOD
was 0.5 pM for 7.5 μL assay, which was a 2 orders of magnitude
improvement from the plate ELISA. Compared to the FDA approved PSA
immunoassays, our microfluidic immunoassay takes a similar amount
of time but lower specimen volume. While our microfluidic immunoassay
exhibits higher LOD in concentration, our assay system shows comparable
LOD in number of antigen molecules.

Conclusion
We have developed a new
microfluidic immunoassay system that can
efficiently capture sandwich immunocomplexes from various volumes
(80 nL to 7.5 μL) of 50% spiked human plasma via the combination
of Ab-PNIPAAm conjugate and the microreactor. The microfluidic immunoassay
takes ca. 30 min. The assay LOD with 80 nL specimen was comparable
to the plate ELISA. When the specimen volume was increased to 7.5
μL, the assay system could concentrate immunocomplexes from
the higher volume specimen and the resulting assay LOD was 2 orders
of magnitude lower than plate ELISA. The low LOD can be attributed
to solution phase formation of the immunocomplex, resulting in greater
interrogation of the sample volume. Also, the high surface to volume
ratio within the device, coupled with flow, increases the immunocomplex–surface
interactions and immobilization. While the microdevice architecture
described here is complex, these protocols could be completed using
a less automated system. There are examples of handheld microfluidic
devices30 that could find utility in this
application, thus permitting point-of-care solutions with sub-pM limits
of detection.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
All
materials used will be listed in the
corresponding procedure section. Unless stated, the materials are
used without further processing or purification.

Polymer Synthesis
The trithiocarbonate chain transfer
agent (CTA) ethyl cyanovaleric trithiocarbonate (ECT) was synthesized
as previously described.31 2,2-Azobis(isobutyronitrile)
(AIBN, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an initiator. N-Isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) monomer (Sigma-Aldrich) was recrystallized
from hexanes. NIPAAm was polymerized with ECT and AIBN as the initiator
at 60 °C in dioxane under a N2 atmosphere for 16 h.
The molar ratio of [monomer]/[CTA]/[initiator] was 450/1/0.1. The
resulting polymer was purified by repeated cycles of precipitation
in pentane (Sigma-Aldrich). The polymer was dried overnight in vacuo.

The resulting PNIPAAm was characterized using GPC performed on
an Agilent 1200 series liquid chromatography system, equipped with
TSKgel alpha 3000 and TSKgel alpha 4000 columns (TOSOH biosciences).
The mobile phase was LiBr (0.01 M) in HPLC grade DMF at a flow rate
of 1 mL min–1. MALS data were obtained on a miniDAWN
TREOS (Wyatt Technologies Corp.) with 658 nm laser source, and three
detectors at 45.8°, 90.0°, and 134.2°. The instrument
calibration constant was 4.7460 × 10–5 V–1cm–1. Refractive index was measured
using an Optilab Rex detector (Wyatt Technologies Corp.). The dn/dc value for the PNIPAAm was determined
under the assumption of 100% mass recovery by injecting polymer samples
at known concentrations into the RI detector postcolumn. The dn/dc value was then calculated using linear
regression with the Astra 5.3.4.14 data analysis software package
(Wyatt Technologies Corp.).

Antibody–PNIPAAm Conjugation
The PNIPAAm–antibody
conjugation utilized PNIAAm with an active ester by converting the
end-carboxylate (Scheme 2) to an amine-reactive
tetrafluorophenol (TFP) ester. 1.5 g (30 μmol) PNIPAAm was mixed
with 8 mg (48 μmol) TFP (Sigma-Aldrich) and 27 mg (219 μmol) N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC,
Sigma-Aldrich) in 12 mL methylene chloride. 4-Dimethylaminopyridine
(DMAP, Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a catalyst in a 1:10 molar ratio
with PNIPAAm. The reaction proceeded overnight at room temperature
in a nitrogen atmosphere and the polymer was purified by repeated
cycles of precipitation in pentane. The polymer was dried overnight
in vacuo and stored under vacuum at −20 °C.

TFP-activated
PNIPAAm (33 mg, 800 nmol) dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 2 mg (1 mg mL–1 in pH 8.5 borate buffer) 5G6 monoclonal antibody (M86599M, Biodesign
International). The reaction proceeded overnight at 4 °C. The
antibody–PNIPAAm conjugates were purified via three sequential
processes, desalting, thermal precipitation, and ion exchange. The
reaction mixture was spun through a desalting column (89883, Thermo
Scientific) primed with pH 7.4 PBS (P-5368, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove
TFP and DMSO. Thermal precipitation, centrifugation at 45 °C,
was utilized to remove nonconjugated Ab. The desalted reaction mixture
was heated to 45 °C for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 10K rpm
for 5 min at 45 °C. After the supernatant was collected (nonconjugated
IgG) the pellet was resuspended in pH 7.4 PBS overnight at 4 °C.
Thermal precipitation was repeated 2 additional times. Removal of
nonconjugated IgG was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy and
SDS-PAGE. Ion exchange was utilized to remove excess polymer. Three
milliliters of anion ion-exchange resin (17–1287–10,
GE Healthcare) was washed 5 times with 10 mL pH 8.5 Tris, followed
by centrifugation at 1450 rpm. The resin was resuspended into 3 mL
pH 8.5 Tris. One milliliter of resin was added to a spin column (732–6008,
Bio-Rad) and spun at 1450 rpm for 5 min. 200 μL of the reaction
mixture was added to the dry resin and allowed to mix overnight at
4 °C (conjugate binding step). The resin was then spun down and
200 μL pH 8.5 Tris was added and allowed to mix overnight at
4 °C (free PNIPAAm wash step). The resin was then spun down and
200 μL pH 8.5 Tris with 0.5 M NaCl was added and allowed to
mix overnight at 4 °C (conjugate release step). Products of each
step were collected and analyzed by UV–vis spectroscopy and
SDS-PAGE.

Antibody–Alkaline Phosphatase Conjugation
Alkaline
phosphatase (AP) conjugation kits (A-9002-001, Solulink) were used
to conjugate AP to 200 μg of 5A6 monoclonal antibody (M86506M,
Biodesign International) by following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, primary amines of 5A6 IgG were functionalized with 6-hydrazino-nicotinic
acid and purified by size exclusion chromatography. Functionalized
IgG was subsequently conjugated to 4-formylbenzoate functionalized
AP via aniline catalyzed bis-arylhydrazone formation.

Human Plasma
Pooled human plasma, with sodium citrate
as an anticoagulant (IPLA-N-02, Innovative Research), was thawed and
centrifuged at 3700 rpm for 30 min. Supernatant was filtered (6994–2504,
Whatman) and stored at 4 °C for subsequent use.

PSA 96-Well
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
To immobilize the
captured antibody the NUNC Maxisorp 96-well plate
was added with 100 μL 5G6 capture antibody (4 μg mL–1 pH 7.4 PBS), covered with plate film, and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then washed 3 times with PBS
Tween (PBST, Fluka) using an automated plate washer (BioTek ELx50).
The plate was added with 200 μL 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v
in PBS), covered with plate film, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature.
During incubation, PSA antigen was diluted to working concentrations
(0, 2, 5, 10, and 25 ng mL–1) in a 50:50 PBS:human
plasma solution. After incubation, each well was again washed 3 times
with PBST. 100 μL antigen solutions were added to the plate
and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. During incubation, the
antibody–AP conjugate (5A6 epitope) was diluted to 50 ng mL–1 in PBST. After incubation, each well was again washed
3 times with PBST. 100 μL of the antibody–AP conjugate
was added to each well, covered in plate film, and allowed to incubate
for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, each well was again
washed 3 times with PBST. 100 μL 5 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate
(4-MUP, Invitrogen) in pH 9.5 Tris was added to each well, covered
with plate film, protected from light, and allowed to incubate at
room temperature for 10 min. The plate film was removed and florescence
(excitation: 360 nm, emission: 440 nm) was measured using a plate
reader (Tecan).

Microfluidic Device Fabrication
Multilayer polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) microfluidic devices were manufactured as described previously.20,23,32 Briefly, degassed 10:1 PDMS:cross-linker
solution was cured on photoresist patterned silicon wafers for at
least 2 h at 65 °C. The control layer master was bonded to a
40-μm-thick PDMS membrane using oxygen plasma bonding. This
layer was then aligned and bonded to a fluid layer using methanol
assisted oxygen plasma bonding. Devices were then allowed to sit overnight
at 65 °C. Poly(ethylene glycol) acrylate (Sigma-Aldrich) was
polymerized from the sidewalls of all input and output fluid channels.
Prior to use, devices were aligned with an ITO heater and the control
channels filled with nanopure water. Control channels were connected
to positive pressure with valve channels regulated to 20 psi and mixing
blades regulated to 5 psi. Valves and blades were actuated using custom
LabView software. After use, devices were flushed with and stored
in nanopure water at 4 °C.

Microfluidic Immunoassay
The procedure for the immunoassay
on the microfluidic device is illustrated in Scheme 3. Prior to the assay on the device, the sandwich immunocomplex
was formed in 50% human plasma outside of device. Using PBS as the
diluent, PSA was diluted 10 000-fold to a working concentration
of 10 nM and the antibody–AP conjugates were diluted 100-fold
to 500 ng mL–1. Aliquots of diluted PSA (to achieve
150 pM, 210 pM, or 300 pM final concentration) in 50 μL human
plasma were vortexed with 5.7 μL capture conjugate (30 nM).
Five microliters of diluted detection conjugate was then added, followed
by PBS to final volume as 100 μL. The solution was vortexed
and allowed to mix at room temperature for 15 min.

Three microfluidic
device inputs were filled with (1) immunocomplex in 50% plasma, (2)
pH 9.5 Tris (50 mM Tris, 100 nM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) wash
buffer, and (3) 5 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4-MUP, M-6491,
Invitrogen) in pH 9.5 Tris, respectively. When the device was held
at 25 °C, immunocomplexes were loaded into the recirculator at
5 μL min–1 for 30 s. After the recirculator
was loaded and sealed the device temperature was raised to 39 °C
and the solution in the recirculator were mixed for 2 min at 5 Hz.
The recirculator was then washed with pH 9.5 Tris for 1 min at 1 μL
min–1. For signal generation, MUP was loaded into
the recirculator at 1 μL min–1 for 2 min.
After the recirculator was sealed, the solution was mixed at 5 Hz
and fluorescence images were acquired every 30 s (with the shutter
closed between exposures) for 10 min and once again at 15 min. Post
assay, the entire device was washed with pH 9.5 Tris as it cooled
to room temperature. Finally, the device was heated to 70 °C
and washed with a pH 9.5 Tris 10 mM EDTA solution for 15 min to inactivate
any residual AP.

PSA Sandwich Immunocomplex Enrichment via
Microfluidic Immuoassay
The assay with immunocomplex enrichment
was carried out using the
aforementioned protocol with minor modification (Scheme 4). Instead of starting the assay with a 25 °C device,
the enrichment assay was carried out with a device that was maintained
at 39 °C constantly. The immunocomplex solution was loaded into
the preheated recirculator at 5 μL min–1 for
30 s (2.5 μL), followed by the mixing and washing processes.
In order to enrich immunocomplexes within the recirculator, the load,
wash, and mixing steps were repeated a total of three times to achieve
a “7.5 μL” condition. The substrate load and turnover,
device wash, and EDTA processes were all the same as the aforementioned
protocol.
