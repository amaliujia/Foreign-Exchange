Introduction
Invariant natural killer
T (iNKT) cells are a
distinctive subset of T lymphocytes that express an invariant αβ
T cell receptor (TCR)− and play an important role in infectious diseases,, tumors,, and autoimmune diseases, such as type I diabetes, and lupus. In contrast to conventional CD4+ and
CD8+ T lymphocytes, which recognize foreign peptides bound
to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or MHC class
II molecule, iNKT cells recognize a range of foreign
and endogenous lipids bound to the nonpolymorphic CD1d molecule., α-Galactosyl ceramide (α-GalCer) 1 is the
prototypical iNKT cell agonist (Figure ). Its presentation by CD1d molecules to TCRs located on iNKT cells results in a powerful immune response involving
the secretion of both pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ
(IFNγ) (Th1-type), and regulatory cytokines, including interleukin-4
(IL-4) (Th2-type). α-GalCer 1 has served as a valuable template for preparing structural
analogues, such as compound OCH 2, a more Th2 cytokine-biasing CD1d agonist,, and the C-glycosyl analogue of α-GalCer, 3(,) (Figure ), which
causes a more Th1 cytokine-biasing immune response upon iNKT cell activation.− Threitol ceramide (ThrCer) 5 (Figure ) also successfully activates iNKT cells and, significantly, overcomes the problematic iNKT cell activation-induced anergy, which is associated with iNKT cell stimulation by α-GalCer.− Moreover, we
have recently shown that amide isosteres of this attractive nonglycosidic
CD1d agonist can also be used to bias the cytokine response toward
Th1-type cytokines.

Glycolipid agonists of
CD1d.

All of the aforementioned glycolipids
activate iNKT cells in a similar fashion, namely
through CD1d-mediated presentation
to TCRs located on these cells; however, the origins of the different
immune responses observed in each case remain poorly understood. Thus, while CD1d and TCR binding affinity likely
play a role,, other factors, such as the cellular
location of glycolipid loading on the CD1d molecule, may also be important
in determining the ensuing immune response. For example, the Th2 cytokine-biasing α-GalCer analogues, 2 and 4, are loaded rapidly onto CD1d molecules
located at the surface of antigen-presenting cells., In contrast, the disaccharide Gal(α1→2)α-GalCer
requires cellular internalization and lysosomal processing before
loading can take place. α-GalCer 1 also exhibits a requirement for endosomal loading before
surface presentation can take place, principally within lipid rafts., To investigate the cellular behavior of different CD1d agonists,
we sought a method for labeling glycolipids, which would allow us
to study the mechanisms that control their uptake by professional
antigen-presenting cells (APC). Herein, we show that the methylene
unit, and more specifically the pro-S hydrogen, α
to the amide functionality provides a new site for appending a label
to this class of molecules. We describe a general and flexible synthesis
strategy that allows structural variation in the glycolipid as well
as late-stage introduction of the label.

Experimental Procedures
General
Experimental Procedures
Melting points were
determined using open capillaries and are uncorrected. Infrared spectra
were recorded either neat or as thin films between NaCl disks. The
intensity of each band is described as s (strong), m (medium), or
w (weak), with the prefix v (very) and suffix br (broad) where appropriate. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500, 400, or 300 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 125, 100, or 75 MHz. Chemical
shifts are reported as δ values (parts per million) referenced
to the following solvent signals: CHCl3, δH 7.26; CDCl3, δC 77.0; CH3OH, δH 3.31; CD3OD, δC 49.9. For spectra recorded in a 1:2 CD3OD/CDCl3 mixed solvent system, chemical shifts are referenced to the residual
methanol peak. The term “stack” is used to describe
a region in which resonances arising from nonequivalent nuclei are
coincident and multiplet, m, to describe a resonance arising from
a single nucleus (or equivalent nuclei) but where coupling constants
cannot be readily assigned. Mass spectra were recorded utilizing electrospray
ionization (and a MeOH mobile phase) and are reported as m/z (%). HRMS spectra were recorded using a lock
mass incorporated into the mobile phase.

All reagents were obtained
from commercial sources and used without further purification unless
stated otherwise. Anhydrous solvents were stored over 4 Å molecular
sieves and under an Ar atmosphere. All solutions are aqueous and saturated
unless stated otherwise.

All reactions were monitored by TLC
using precoated aluminum-backed
ICN silica plates (60A F254) and visualized by UV detection
(at 254 nm) and staining with 5% phosphomolybdic acid in EtOH (MPA
spray). Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (particle
size of 40–63 μm mesh).

A CuSO4 solution
(12 μL of a 0.5 M solution, 6 μmol) and a sodium ascorbate

to a solution of azide (S)-17 (25 mg,
0.029 mmol) and alkyne 18 (13 mg, 0.029 mmol) in a t-BuOH/H2O mixture (1 mL, 1:1) at room temperature.
The reaction mixture was heated for 10 h at 50 °C, diluted with
CHCl3 (10 mL), and washed with brine (3 mL). The phases
were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with CHCl3 (2 × 5 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over
Na2SO4, and the volatiles were removed under
reduced pressure. Purification of the residue by flash column chromatography
(10% MeOH in CHCl3) afforded triazole (S)-10 as a white paste (28 mg, 77%): Rf = 0.20 (10% CH3OH in CHCl3); the poor solubility of this amphiphilic compound at room

(6 μL of a 0.5 M solution, 3 μmol) and a sodium ascorbate

Mice, Cell
Lines, and Cultures
C57 BL/6 mice were used
in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. iNKT cells were generated from healthy blood donors as previously
described.,iNKT cell cultures
were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute-1640 (RPMI-1640)
supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% nonessential amino
acids, 1% pyruvate, 1% Pen/Strep, 5% human serum (Gibco), and 500
units of IL-2/mL. Functional assays and C1R CD1d lipid pulsing were
performed in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine,
1% nonessential amino acids, 1% pyruvate, 1% Pen/Strep (Gibco), and
10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma).

iNKT Cell
TCR Tetramer Staining
The
synthesis of soluble iNKT TCR heterodimers has been
described previously. C1R CD1d cells
were pulsed with different concentrations of the indicated iNKT cell agonists for 16 h. Cells were washed with a PBS/10%
FCS mixture and incubated with 0.5–1.0 μg of iNKT cell TCR tetramer or equivalent amounts of streptavidin
on ice for 30 min. Cells were also stained with an antibiotin FITC-conjugated
antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed,
and samples were analyzed on a FACScalibur instrument (BD). Data analysis
was performed using Flowjo (Treestar).

iNKT Cell
Activation and Cytokine Detection
A polyclonal human iNKT cell line, or a mouse iNKT cell hybridoma
(DN32), was incubated for 36 h with
monocyte-derived DCs in the presence or absence of iNKT cell agonists and the level of cytokines released by iNKT cells measured in the supernatants. The concentrations
of human IFN-γ and mouse IL-2 were measured by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as previously described. All samples were tested at the same time on a single ELISA
plate for each assay. In addition, for in vitro activation of mouse iNKT cells, 5 × 105 splenocytes from C57
BL/6 mice were pulsed with various concentrations of lipids for 48
h. Supernatants were removed, and the presence of IFN-γ was
determined by an ELISA.

Results
and Discussion
Chemical labeling studies of α-GalCer 1 have
previously introduced the label at C(6)OH of the galactose residue;, however, this strategy was rejected for a number of reasons. First,
we desired a labeling methodology that could be employed generally
for a range of CD1d agonists, including truncated sugar analogues
such as ThrCer 5, which lack a C(6) tethering site. Second, crystal structures of C(6)-derivatized
α-GalCer analogues reveal the functionality at C(6) can exploit
a hydrophobic binding site in CD1d, which
is not available to α-GalCer, and that this additional binding
affects the biological activity, something
to be avoided when trying to retain the activity of the agonist under
investigation. Labels have also been appended to the terminus of the N-acyl chain of α-GalCer;− however, we
reasoned that a CD1d agonist modified in this fashion would result
in the label being buried deep inside the A′ pocket of the
protein molecule. This might significantly alter the binding conformation
of the glycolipid under study, and analogues biotinylated in this
way would mean the biotin label would likely be unavailable for streptavidin
or antibiotin antibody recognition. Analysis of X-ray structures of
the TCR−α-GalCer–CD1d complex, and similar ternary complexes involving α-GalCer
analogues,− reveals the glycolipid binds to the CD1d molecule
in a similar fashion, with the N-acyl chain occupying
the hydrophobic A′ pocket of the protein and the ceramide base
the less voluminous F′ pocket, leaving the polar sugar residue
surface-exposed for TCR recognition. For our purposes, this analysis
allowed us to identify the α-methylene unit of the amide chain,
and specifically the pro-S hydrogen
at this position, as being amenable to substitution because this group
is directed out toward bulk solvent in the ternary complex (Figure ). We postulated that a label incorporated into
this position would protrude away from the ternary TCR–glycolipid–CD1d
complex without deleteriously affecting its conformation and, at the
same time, also permit recognition of a tethered reporter group such
as a biotin label.

Substituents appended to the pro-S hydrogen substituent in the α position of the N-acyl chain (highlighted with the arrow) should extend
beyond and
away from the TCR–glycolipid–CD1d recognition site (structure
taken from Protein Data Bank entry 2PO6()).

Because of the challenging practical
issues associated with handling
glycolipids, and the high cost of many labels, our chosen synthetic
strategy for the two targets, (S)-10 [note that the (S) label denotes the absolute configuration
of the stereogenic center located α to the amide carbonyl group]
and 11, would incorporate the label at a late stage of
the synthesis and use Click chemistry to assemble the components,
ideally using an already fully deprotected glycolipid (Scheme ). An oligo(ethylene glycol) spacer unit would be
employed as a linker, to ensure the label
extends sufficiently from the TCR recognition site so as not to interrupt
antigen presentation. We expected such a linker might also impart
favorable solubility properties on the final products., Further disconnection of amide 6 revealed α-azido
acid 7, which would be coupled selectively with the amino
functionality embedded in 8. Amine 8 would
be assembled from phytosphingosine-derived glycosyl acceptor 9, and an appropriate glycosyl
donor.

General Retrosynthetic Strategy for the Assembly of Labeled
Glycolipids
and Target Molecules (S)-10 and 11
The synthesis of our
first target, biotinylated ThrCer (S)-10, is detailed in Scheme . Enantiopure (S)-2-azidohexacosanoic acid
(S)-15 was readily accessed from Schöllkopf’s
auxiliary 12;− thus, treatment of bis-lactim 12 with BuLi, followed by reaction of the resulting lithiated
intermediate with 1-iodotetracosane, afforded
the alkylation product as a separable 15:1 mixture of diastereoisomers.
The desired major diastereoisomer 13 was then hydrolyzed
to afford α-amino ester 14. Subsequent diazo transfer and
ester hydrolysis afforded α-azido
acid (S)-15, which was converted into
the corresponding acid chloride and coupled with amine 16 (see the ) under
biphasic reaction conditions to afford amide (S)-17 [note that the (S) label denotes the absolute
configuration of the stereogenic center located α to the amide
carbonyl group] in good yield. While there is the potential for racemization
of the α-azido acid chloride coupling partner, a comparison
of the 13C NMR data of (S)-17 with those of (R/S)-17 [note that the (R/S) label denotes
a 1:1 mixture of diastereoisomers epimeric at the stereogenic center
located α to the amide carbonyl group in 17] showed
that no epimerization had occurred at the α-stereogenic center
under the acylation reaction conditions (see the ). In the final step, Huisgen [3+2]
dipolar cycloaddition, of the azide in (S)-17 with alkyne 18 (see the ) provided our target,
biotinylated ThrCer (S)-10, in 77% isolated
yield.

Synthesis of Biotinylated ThrCer (S)-10
Before progressing
with biological analysis of biotinylated ThrCer
(S)-10 and to assess the importance
of obtaining the correct stereochemistry at the tethering site, we
used racemic 2-azidohexacosanoic acid in the synthetic sequence summarized
in Scheme  to access the diastereoisomeric
end product (R)-10 [epimeric at the
tethering site; the (R) label denotes the absolute
configuration of the stereogenic center located α to the amide
carbonyl group], which could be separated from its epimer (S)-10 by careful column chromatography.

A 1:1 epimeric mixture (S/R)-10 and the single epimers of biotinylated ThrCer, (S)-10 and (R)-10, were next tested separately for their ability to be loaded onto
human CD1d molecules as defined by staining with tetrameric human iNKT cell TCR, (Figure a) and recognized by murine iNKT cells (Figure b). In the first experiment,
C1R-human CD1d cells were loaded with ThrCer 5 and the
corresponding biotinylated analogues and then incubated with fluorescent
human iNKT cell TCR. Subsequent fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that (S)-10 and the epimeric mixture behaved like unlabeled ThrCer 5 in their ability to be recognized by the iNKT cell TCR, while the activity of the (R)-epimer,
(R)-10, used on its own, was slightly
attenuated (Figure a). In a second assay,
C1R-mouse CD1d cells were first loaded with ThrCer 5 and
the corresponding biotinylated analogues and then cultured overnight
in the presence of iNKT cell hybridoma (DN32). iNKT cell activation was assessed by measuring interleukin-2
(IL-2) production by an ELISA., Once again, and in
line with our predictions, the two epimeric biotinylated ThrCer analogues
behaved differently in their ability to activate iNKT cells, and in accord with our hypothesis, the labeled analogue,
possessing the (S)-configuration at the tethering
site, behaved significantly better than its (R)-epimer
(Figure b). In this experiment, the more active
labeled epimer, (S)-10, appears to show
greater activity than unlabeled ThrCer itself at high lipid concentrations.
Modifying the structure of any agonist is likely to have some impact
on the activity, and in this experiment, our labeled analogue is no
different. The greater activity compared with that of its unlabeled
analogue (ThrCer) in this assay is interesting, and we postulate that
differences in lipid processing (i.e., uptake and presentation on
CD1d molecules) of murine and human APCs and the subsequent iNKT cell TCR may explain these observations. Although there
was a difference in activity between the two epimers, the biological
results using a 1:1 epimeric mixture (in which the concentration of
the more active epimer is halved) proved to be similar to those using
the single epimer (S)-10, and for this
reason, all subsequent experiments described below were performed
with the more readily accessed epimeric mixture.

are means of triplicate wells and are representative of three independent
experiments.

Further experiments using
human iNKT cells confirmed
that the presence of the biotin label does not affect optimal loading
onto CD1d molecules and presentation to human iNKT
cells. To this end, C1R-hCD1d cells were pulsed with labeled (10) and unlabeled ThrCer (5), and their ability
to be recognized by iNKT cells was assessed by measuring
the release of IFN-γ by an ELISA after the cells had been cultured
for 36 h (Figure ). The similar response profile
observed with ThrCer 5 and its biotinylated analogue
(10) indicated that human iNKT cells
are sensitized to a similar level, and that the biotin label does
not affect significantly CD1d loading or iNKT cell
presentation.

In vitro activation of human iNKT cells

A human iNKT cell line was incubated with C1R CD1d
cells pulsed either with ThrCer 5 (■) or with
biotinylated ThrCer 10 (epimeric mixture) (□).
IFN-γ secretion was analyzed after 36 h by an ELISA. The results
are representative of three separate experiments.

To further investigate the availability of the biotin on
the cell
surface of the APC, C1R CD1d cells were pulsed with biotinylated ThrCer 10 for 16 h before being stained with fluorescent streptavidin
(Figure b), the antibiotin antibody (Figure ), or soluble iNKT cell TCR (Figure a). These results demonstrate
that (i) the label can be detected by these two commonly used detection
methods, opening up the possibility of using these as staining reagents
to identify biotinylated ThrCer-pulsed cells, (ii) the TCR recognizes
the labeled glycolipid in the context of CD1d molecules, and (iii)
we are able to perform double staining using both soluble iNKT cell TCR and antibiotin antibody showing that the glycolipid–CD1d
complex and label can be detected at the same time (Figure d).

Detection of biotinylated ThrCer 10 (1:1

indicated concentrations of biotinylated ThrCer for 16 h and then
stained with (a) soluble iNKT cell TCR (APC), (b)
fluorescent streptavidin (APC), or (c) the antibiotin antibody [labeled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)]. Panels a–c depict
histogram overlays of the indicated fluorescence intensities. The
dot plot shown in panel d depicts a double staining with the soluble iNKT cell TCR (APC) and antibiotin antibody (FITC). The
results are representative of two separate experiments.

Next, to assess the generality of our glycolipid
labeling strategy,
we chose to introduce a fluorescent label into a second CD1d agonist,
namely the Th2 cytokine-biasing CD1d agonist α-GalCer C20:2
(4). The synthesis of labeled α-GalCer C20:2, 11, is summarized in Scheme . α-Galactoside 20, prepared in six steps from phytosphingosine 19 using our recently developed methodology for accessing 6″-azido-6″-deoxy-α-GalCer
analogues, was coupled with enantiomerically
pure α-azido acid chloride 21, accessed from the
Schöllkopf auxiliary and linoleyl bromide (see the ), to provide amide 22 as an advanced intermediate in excellent yield. Subsequent
Click reaction with alkyne 23 afforded our target, fluorescently
labeled α-GalCer C20:2, 11.

Synthesis of Fluor
488-Labeled α-GalCer C20:2 11
The ability of α-GalCer C20:2 (4) and labeled
α-GalCer C20:2 (11) to activate murine iNKT cells was assessed (Figure ). To this end, mouse splenocytes were
cultured separately with various concentrations of α-GalCer
C20:2 4, and the corresponding Fluor 488-labeled analogue 11, and then the presence of IFN-γ was detected in the
culture supernatant by an ELISA. As for the biotinylated ThrCer analogue,
these results showed that the label does not significantly affect
the behavior of α-GalCer C20:2 in its ability to activate murine iNKT cells, especially at low biologically relevant concentrations
of the glycolipid, opening up the possibility of using this labeled
analogue to study the biology of the important Th2 cytokine-biasing
CD1d agonist α-GalCer C20:2 4.

In vitro activation of iNKT cells by Fluor 488-labeled
α-GalCer C20:2 11. Splenocytes from C57 BL/6 mice
were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of either
unlabeled 4 or Fluor 488-labeled α-GalCer C20:2 11 for 48 h. The supernatants were then analyzed for the presence
of IFN-γ by an ELISA. Data are means of duplicate wells and
are representative of two independent experiments.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
shown that the pro-S hydrogen site
in the α-methylene of the N-acyl chain of two
important CD1d agonists, namely, ThrCer 5 and α-GalCer
C20:2 4, can be used to
append a label. In the two examples targeted, the functional activity
of the labeled molecules was comparable in the human and mouse systems
to that displayed by the unlabeled molecules, which should allow us
to use these labeled analogues to study their trafficking behavior
in vivo. The synthesis of both epimers of the biotinylated ThrCer
analogue confirmed the importance of choosing the correct configuration
at the tethering site, which was in accord with our predictions based
on X-ray crystallographic structure analyses of the TCR−α-GalCer–CD1d
ternary complex. Moreover, we were able to show for the first time
that a biotin label attached to ThrCer remains accessible even when
the soluble iNKT TCR is bound to the CD1d–lipid
complex, as demonstrated by the double staining with soluble iNKT TCR and an antibiotin antibody. Because our synthetic
strategy allows the incorporation of any sugar headgroup and fatty
acid acyl chain and involves the late-stage introduction of the label
from an advanced intermediate, we expect other CD1d agonists (and
potentially other bioactive glycolipids) can be labeled using this
approach.
