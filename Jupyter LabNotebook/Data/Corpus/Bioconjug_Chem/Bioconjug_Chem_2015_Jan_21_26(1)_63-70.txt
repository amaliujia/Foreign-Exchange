We
describe a method for transforming a structure-switching aptamer
into a luminescent light-switch probe via a single conjugation. The
methodology is demonstrated using a known aptamer for Hg2+ as a case study. This approach utilizes a lanthanide-based metallointercalator,
Eu-DOTA-Phen, whose luminescence is quenched almost entirely and selectively
by purines, but not at all by pyrimidines. This complex, therefore,
does not luminesce while intercalated in dsDNA, but it is bright red
when conjugated to a ssDNA that is terminated by several pyrimidines.
In its design, the light-switch probe incorporates a structure-switching
aptamer partially hybridized to its complementary strand. The lanthanide
complex is conjugated to either strand via a stable amide bond. Binding
of the analyte by the structure-switching aptamer releases the complementary
strand. This release precludes intercalation of the intercalator in
dsDNA, which switches on its luminescence. The resulting probe turns
on 21-fold upon binding to its analyte. Moreover, the structure switching
aptamer is highly selective, and the long luminescence lifetime of
the probe readily enables time-gating experiments for removal of the
background autofluorescence of the sample.

Introduction
Aptamers, single-stranded
oligonucleotides that bind with high
affinity and high selectivity to a selected target such as a protein,
a small molecule, or a metal ion, are increasingly used in therapeutics,
diagnosis, and detection.1 Luminescent
analogs have been prevalent for the latter two applications due to
the widespread use of the technique. Indeed, significant work has
already been published on the design of fluorescent aptamer-based
probes, most commonly and successfully with approaches involving molecular
beacons2−5 and aptamer-based G-quadruplex systems.6−9 Unfortunately, this technology
requires multiple, often difficult, bioconjugation steps and it remains
ill-adapted to multiplex detection and applications in complex aqueous
or biological media. The first limitation with regard to synthesis
can, in theory, be met with the use of light-switch DNA intercalators,
molecules whose quantum yields vary greatly upon intercalation between
base pairs. However, intercalators have so far only been used in “label-free”
approaches, which consist of simply mixing the intercalators with
the aptamer. In each case, most of the dyes are intercalated both
in the absence and in the presence of the analyte. Consequently, the
responses observed were small and also turn-off.10−19 The other two limitations, multiplex detection and detection in
a complex aqueous sample, could in theory be resolved with a lanthanide-based
probe.20 The narrow emission bands and
long luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide complexes make them uniquely
suited for multiplex detection and quantitative analysis in complex
media via time-gated measurements. Herein we report such a light-switch
lanthanide-based aptamer probe, with substantial turn-on and a long luminescence lifetime in the millisecond range. Its synthesis,
unlike that of most aptamer-based probes,2−5 requires only one bioconjugation.
In comparison, other systems need an individual conjugation for both
the fluorophore and the quencher. The application of this methodology
can readily be expanded to other substrates and for multiplex detection.
The key to multiplex detection is simply to ensure that each aptamer
probe for each analyte has a unique reporter strand sequence and makes
use of a distinct lanthanide ion such as terbium, europium, thulium,
dysprosium, or samarium. Since the emission spectra of lanthanide
ions mostly do not overlap, they can be readily used for multiplex
detection. Multiplex detection with lanthanide ions has been extensively
reported by our group and others.21−24

In terms of design, we
postulated that the first of the aforementioned
three limitations, the number of bioconjugation steps, could be resolved
via a single conjugation of a light-switch DNA intercalator to a structure-switching
aptamer. Structure-switching aptamers change their structure upon
binding to their cognate target, most often via the release of a shorter
complementary strand.25,26 Judicious conjugation of an intercalating
dye to either strand of such an aptamer/complement duplex ensures
that the dye is completely intercalated only in the absence of the
analyte, but is not intercalated in the presence of the analyte (Figure 1). If the intercalating dye itself is a light-switch,
then the aptamer probe will also be one. The probe is thus devised
to have a higher response than label-free intercalator-based systems,13 while at the same time limiting bioconjugation
to a single DNA strand. In this design, use of a dye that only luminesces
while intercalated will result in a turn-off probe,
while one that is quenched by stacking with base pairs will result
in a turn-on probe. Standard intercalators, which
are luminescent only when intercalated, would thus turn-off: in the absence of the analyte they would intercalate and be luminescent;
whereas in the presence of the analyte they would not intercalate
and not luminesce. Since turn-on probes are generally
preferred for practical applications, this design excludes the use
of common light-switch intercalators such as dppz-based ruthenium27 or osmium complexes,28 platinum complexes,29,30 or organo-intercalators such
as ethidium bromide.31 Instead, we postulated
that the desired response could be achieved with lanthanide complexes
whose luminescence is nearly completely quenched upon intercalation
in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Our complex works as a turn-on probe because its response to intercalation is reversed:
it is not luminescent when intercalated (i.e., in the absence of the
analyte) but is luminescent when not intercalated (i.e., in the presence
of the analyte). A further advantage of using lanthanides is that
they also solve the other two limitations mentioned above of current
molecular beacons. The long luminescence lifetimes of lanthanide complexes,
typically in the millisecond range for EuIII and TbIII, enable facile time-gating experiments whereby the background
autofluorescence of the sample is removed. Lanthanides have multiple
emission bands which are also narrow. These narrow emission bands
with limited overlap further enable simultaneous detection of multiple
analytes in the same sample. If bands which do not overlap at all
are chosen, multiple probes with different lanthanides can be used
simultaneously in the same medium to test several analytes.

Figure 1 Proposed mode
of action of aptamer light-switch, Eu-AptaSwitch
(1). In the absence of Hg2+, the EuIII complex intercalates in dsDNA. Photoelectron transfer from the purines
to the phenanthridine antenna quenches the luminescence of EuIII. Binding of Hg2+ by the aptamer releases the
short complementary strand, thereby preventing intercalation of the
EuIII complex and turning on its luminescence.

This design thus requires a lanthanide complex
not only capable
of intercalating in dsDNA, but whose luminescence is substantially
affected by the oligonucleotide. Our group21,32,33 and Parker’s34−37 have previously demonstrated
that the luminescence of phenanthridine-based terbium and europium
complexes can be nearly completely quenched upon intercalation in
dsDNA. This effect, which is likely the result of photoelectron transfer
from stacked purines to the excited state of the chromophore, was
the basis behind the recent design of our probe for GTP and ATP detection.21,33 Importantly, although both purines efficiently quench the lanthanide-centered
emission of this complex, neither of the two pyrimidines does. Our
probe, Eu-AptaSwitch (1), was thus constructed by conjugating
the phenanthridine-based lanthanide complex to the DNA strand of the
structure-switching aptamer that is mostly composed of thymidines
and cytidines (Figure 2). The shorter complementary
strand is thus primarily composed of adenosines and guanosines. The
probe was designed to function as follows (Figure 1). In the absence of the analyte, i.e., when the phenanthridine
is intercalated in the dsDNA, the probe is in the off mode. Photoelectron transfer (PeT) from the stacked purine bases
quenches the lanthanide luminescence. Binding of the analyte by the
aptamer releases the short complementary strand. At this point, intercalation
and quenching of the phenanthridine by purines are no longer possible.
Therefore, the luminescence of the lanthanide complex turns on.

alkyl chain.
The two oligonucleotides are annealed prior to use.

A note on the stability of the metal complex used
for detection
and diagnosis. The probe Eu-AptaSwitch (1) incorporates
a macrocyclic polyaminocarboxylate ligand which renders the complex
both thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert. Lanthanide complexes
used for biological and medical applications must be stable and inert
so as to minimize the risk of trans-metalation with Ca2+ and trans-ligation of the lanthanide with endogenous ligands such
as phosphates.38 Although more difficult
to synthesize than their linear analogs, macrocyclic DOTA-type chelates,
such as the one used in this study, are more appropriate for detection
of analytes in biological or environmental aqueous systems due to
their kinetic inertness. Furthermore, the overall positively charged
lanthanide complexes of DOTA tetraamide (DOTAm) ligands are kinetically
more inert than DOTA analogues as a result of the decreased basicity
of the nitrogen atoms.39

As a proof
of principle, we applied our concept to a structure-switching
aptamer previously reported for Hg2+.40 This aptamer makes use of the ability of thymidines to
coordinate Hg2+ in a T-Hg2+-T fashion. Therefore,
the lanthanide complex was conjugated to the thymidine-rich strand
that binds Hg2+ as opposed to its shorter complementary
strand. Note that in order to further increase the turn-on response of the probe, some of the purine bases in the mercury-binding
strand reported by Lu40 were replaced by
pyrimidines (third and fifth positions, A to C and G to C, respectively).
We anticipate that this design can be applied to any structure-switching
aptamer, regardless of how the aptamer binds its analyte.

Results and Discussion
The molecular probe Eu-AptaSwitch (1) was synthesized
according to Scheme 1 from three advanced intermediates:
DO2AtBu (2),41 the phenanthridine acetamide arm (3),33 and the bridging arm (5). The syntheses
of the former two were previously reported in the literature. Coupling
of the phenanthridine arm (3) to DO2AtBu (2) followed by that of the bridging arm (5). yielded the fully protected ligand (6). Treatment
under acidic conditions deprotected the acids and the amine simultaneously,
thereby yielding the free ligand which was metalated with EuIII under slightly basic aqueous conditions. Note that as for any DOTA-type
complex, long reaction times are needed to ensure full complexation
of the lanthanide by the macrocycle.42 Advantageously,
the stability of the resulting amine-terminated complex enables subsequent
conjugation to any molecule containing a carboxylate. For our intended
application, the complex was reacted with the DADE-terminated aptamer
oligonucleotide while on solid support. DADE (decanoic acid diester)
is a commercially available preactivated carboxyl linker that enables
facile conjugation to the EuIII-complex all the while being
long enough for the phenanthridine to intercalate in the dsDNA (Figure 2). Cleavage of the bioconjugate from its solid support,
followed by deprotection of the bases and purification by reverse
phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), yielded the EuIII ssDNA conjugate (9) that was annealed with
the short complementary strand to yield the luminescent probe Eu-AptaSwitch
(1). Notably, bioconjugation was only possible with a
lanthanide complex containing an amine and a DNA terminated with an
activated carboxylic acid. Our multiple attempts at reversing the
functional groups, that is, to conjugate a Eu complex with a pendant
acid or activated acid to an amine-terminated oligonucleotide, were
all unsuccessful, regardless of the coupling agent used. This also
highlights the difficulty of conjugating metal complexes to DNA.2−4,43−54 The synthesis described above should be applicable to the conjugation
of other types of metal complexes to DNA for therapeutic and diagnostic
purposes.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Eu-AptaSwitch (1)
Experimental
conditions: (a)
Et3N, CHCl3, 62 °C, 18 h; (b) Cs2CO3, CH3CN, 82 °C, 18 h; (c) HCl, CH3OH, rt, 5 d; (d) EuCl3·6H2O, LiOH,
H2O, pH 8, 70 °C, 76 h; (e) conjugation of the aptamer
to the DADE linker (on solid support) in phosphate buffer, pH 8, 15
h; deprotection: 30% NH3, 65 °C, 5 h; (f) complementary
strand, PBS, 95 °C for 15 min, slow cooling.

The time-gated emission profile of the probe in the absence and
presence of its analyte is shown in Figure 3. As expected, annealing the Eu-ssDNA (9) conjugate
with the complementary strand quenches most of the metal-centered
luminescence; the luminescence of the annealed Eu-AptaSwitch (1) is only 4% that of the ssDNA conjugate (9).
This result is consistent with intercalation of the phenanthridine
in the dsDNA; resulting photoelectron transfer from the purine bases
to the antenna quenches the lanthanide-based emission. Importantly,
the luminescence of EuIII is fully recovered upon addition
of Hg2+. This observation is in agreement with binding
of Hg2+ by its structure-switching aptamer concomitant
with release of the complementary strand such that the phenanthridine
can no longer intercalate in dsDNA. Since PeT from purine bases to
the antenna is no longer possible, luminescence of EuIII is recovered. This design enables not only a complete recovery of
the lanthanide emission, but also a substantial 21-fold turn-on which is comparable to that of other light-switch probes.
Support for our proposed mechanism of action comes from three observations.
First, the luminescence of the unconjugated Eu complex (8) is identical to that of the Eu-ssDNA conjugate (9);
they both have the same excitation and emission profiles and the same
quantum yield. Second, the luminescence of the probe after addition
of Hg2+ is also identical to that of the Eu-ssDNA conjugate
(9, same excitation and emission profiles, and same quantum
yield). Last, heating the probe past its melting point in the absence
of Hg2+, which also liberates the Eu-complex by unfolding
the DNA, also turns the Eu luminescence back on. The combination of
these three observations strongly supports our proposed mechanism.

emission profiles of Eu-DNA conjugate (9) (solid line),
Eu-AptaSwitch (1) (dotted line), Eu-AptaSwitch·Hg2+(dashed line). Experimental conditions: [Eu-DNA conjugate]
= [Eu-AptaSwitch] = 20 μM, [Hg2+] = 250 μM,
PBS buffer, pH = 7.0, T = 20 °C, time-delay
= 0.1 ms, slit widths = 20 nm, excitation at 271 nm.

Notably, such a turn-on is readily
observable
with the naked eye upon illumination with a standard portable UV-lamp
(Figure 4). The characteristic luminescence
of the probe is only apparent in the presence of 10 equiv of Hg2+. Although Eu emits in the red, the probe appears purple
to the naked eye. Indeed, pure Eu-centered emission can only be observed
with time-gating, as was performed in all of the titrations. Without
time-gating and with the naked eye, one sees a combination of the
Eu-centered emission (red) and the left-over emission from the phenanthridine
antenna which is not transferred to the lanthanide (blue). The combination
of the red Eu emission and the blue antenna emission give the overall
purple color seen in the photo taken with a standard hand-held camera.
This light-switch response thus bodes well for future application
of this technology to the detection of other analytes without the
need for a spectrophotometer. Moreover, the probe detects its analyte
rapidly; the luminescence turn-on is observed in
1 min after adding mercury at room temperature.

with a portable UV lamp in the absence (a) and presence (b) of 10
equiv of HgII. Experimental conditions: PBS, pH 7.0, rt,
λexcitation = 254 nm.

Time-gated luminescence titration of Eu-AptaSwitch (1) in the presence of Hg2+ is shown in Figure 5. Turn-on in the presence of low
concentration of mercury is shown in the inset. The very long lifetime
characteristic of EuIII-centered luminescence, a requirement
for time-gating experiments, is ideally suited for titrations in complex
aqueous media. Note that, as for Lu’s probe,40 the titration curve of Eu-AptaSwitch can be fitted with
a Hill coefficient of 2, suggesting a cooperative binding of Hg2+ to the aptamer.

Figure 5 Time-gated luminescence of Eu-AptaSwitch (1) with
increasing concentration of Hg2+. Experimental conditions:
[Eu-AptaSwitch] = 20 μM, PBS buffer, pH = 7.0, T = 20 °C, time-delay = 0.1 ms, slit widths = 20 nm, excitation
at 271 nm, emission integrated from 450 to 750 nm, error bars represent
SD, n = 3. Inset: data points at low concentrations
of Hg2+.

Importantly, conjugating
the Eu complex to the aptamer does not
changes its affinity for Hg2+, nor its selectivity over
competing divalent metal. The selectivity of the probe toward the
alkali earth and transition metals Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+ is shown
in Figure 6. The probe does not turn on upon
addition of an excess of each competing metal ions. Importantly, the
presence of these metal ions also does not influence the response
of the probe toward Hg2+. The light-switch probe (1) remains highly selective, as was the original probe reported
by Lu and co-workers. The fact that the metallointercalator does not
influence the response of the aptamer bodes well for other applications.

Figure 6 Selectivity
of Eu-AptaSwitch (1). Gray bars represent
the luminescence response after adding 250 μM metal ion (except
Hg2+, which is only 25 μM). Black bars represent
the luminescence response after adding 25 μM of Hg2+ to the probe containing 250 μM metal ion. Experimental conditions:
[Eu-AptaSwitch] = 20 μM, PBS buffer, pH = 7.0, T = 20 °C, time-delay = 0.1 ms, excitation at 271 nm, emission
at 592 nm, error bars represent SD, n = 3.

A distinct advantage of lanthanides
in the design of probes is
their very long luminescence lifetime, in the millisecond range, that
is uniquely suited for applications in complex aqueous media. With
such long lifetimes, the background autofluorescence of the sample
can readily be removed with time-gating experiments allowing for more
accurate measurements at low turn-on. Indeed, as
can be seen in Figure 7, the Eu-AptaSwitch
probe is also efficient in Human serum. A lower turn-on is observed for a given concentration of Hg2+ in serum
as compared to phosphate-buffered saline. This difference could be
due to partial quenching of the lanthanide emission by serum protein
and/or to binding of Hg2+ by serum proteins, which decreases
the concentration of Hg2+ available to the probe.

nm, error bars represent SD, n = 3.

Conclusion
In conclusion, a novel
approach to the design of luminescent aptamer
probes that makes use of a light-switch lanthanide intercalator is
reported. Compared to beacon-type approaches, this approach only requires
a single conjugation, and therefore enables a more facile synthesis.
As opposed to the label-free approaches that also employ DNA intercalators,
our approach yields not only a turn-on response but
also a substantially greater response. Moreover, the structure switching
aptamer ensures the selectivity of the probe, while the long luminescence
lifetime and the narrow emission bands of lanthanide metals are expected
to facilitate multiplex detection in a single, complex aqueous sample.

Unless otherwise noted, starting
materials were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without
further purification. DNA was purchased from Trilink Biotechnologies.
Water was distilled and further purified by a Millipore cartridge
system (resistivity 1.8 × 107 Ω). Flash chromatography
was performed on Salicycle Silica Gel (230–400 mesh) or Brockmann
activated aluminum oxide (neutral, 60 mesh). 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Varian 300 or Varian 500 at 300 or 500 MHz respectively,
and 13C NMR spectra on a Varian 300 at 75 MHz at the LeClaire-Dow
Instrumentation Facility at the Department of Chemistry at the University
of Minnesota, Twin-Cities. The residual solvent peak was used as an
internal reference. Data for 1H NMR are recorded as follows:
chemical shift (δ, ppm), multiplicity (s, singlet; br s, broad
singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet), integration,
coupling constant (Hz). Data for 13C NMR are reported in
terms of chemical shift (δ, ppm). Mass spectra (LR = low resolution;
HR = high resolution; ESI = electrospray ionization) were recorded
on a Bruker BioTOF II at the Waters Center of Innovation for Mass
Spectrometry at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota,
Twin-Cities. Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry, HPLC-ESI-MS
were performed on an Agilent 1100 capillary HPLC-ion trap mass spectrometer
(Agilent Technologies) at the Mass Spectrometry facility at the Masonic
Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota. A Zorbax 300SB-C8 column
(150 mm × 0.3 mm, 3.5 μm, Agilent Technologies) was eluted
at a flow rate of 9 μL/min with a gradient of 15 mM ammonium
acetate and 5–16% acetonitrile in over 14 min and then up to
90% over 2 min. The column was maintained at 40 °C. The mass
spectrometer was operated in the negative mode for the analyses of
oligonucleotide conjugates. UV–vis data was obtained on a Cary
Bio 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer. Fluorescence data was acquired
on a Varian Cary Eclipse Spectrophotometer using a quartz cell with
a path length of 10 mm, excitation slit width of 20 nm, and emission
slit width of 20 nm at 20 °C.
