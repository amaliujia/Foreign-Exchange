We
report a simple temperature-responsive bioconjugate system comprising
superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) decorated with poly[(oligo
ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PEGMA) polymers. We used
amber suppression to site-specifically incorporate the non-canonical
azide-functional amino acid p-azidophenylalanine
(pAzF) into sfGFP at different positions. The azide
moiety on modified sfGFP was then coupled using copper-catalyzed “click”
chemistry with the alkyne terminus of a PEGMA synthesized by reversible
addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization.
The protein in the resulting bioconjugate was found to remain functionally
active (i.e., fluorescent) after conjugation. Turbidity measurements
revealed that the point of attachment of the polymer onto the protein
scaffold has an impact on the thermoresponsive behavior of the resultant
bioconjugate. Furthermore, small-angle X-ray scattering analysis showed
the wrapping of the polymer around the protein in a temperature-dependent
fashion. Our work demonstrates that standard genetic manipulation
combined with an expanded genetic code provides an easy way to construct
functional hybrid biomaterials where the location of the conjugation
site on the protein plays an important role in determining material
properties. We anticipate that our approach could be generalized for
the synthesis of complex functional materials with precisely defined
domain orientation, connectivity, and composition.

Introduction
Ever since the pioneering work of Davis
and co-workers,1,2 the conjugation of synthetic macromolecules
with proteins to enhance
the chemical properties and functions of the latter has been demonstrated
for a variety of systems and a range of applications. Some illustrative
examples include increased protein activity, proteolytic resistance,
and thermal and pH stability,3,4 properties that have
been attributed to the careful selection of the molecular characteristics
of the polymer and the conjugation site.3 The vast majority of reports involve proteins conjugated with poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG),5−8 as it is a biocompatible polymer with a proven record of applications.3,4,8−11 Noteworthy also is the use of
branched PEG analogues that have been shown to further enhance the
biocompatibility of their protein bioconjugates.12 Nevertheless, the use of polymers that endow the protein
with more intricate properties has been sought, such as polymers that
respond to external stimuli.13,14

Stimuli-responsive
polymers can be used to expand the properties
of protein–polymer systems,15−17 owing to their ability
to change their physicochemical properties as a response to small
changes in their environment (i.e., temperature, pH, light, etc.)
and their corresponding bioconjugates inherit that ability, obtaining
a triggered (and commonly reversible) amphiphilic character.18−24 Hoffman and co-workers pioneered the use of stimuli-responsive polymers
for conjugation with proteins that allowed their isolation and reuse,
or modulation of their activity.25−29 In other examples, permanently amphiphilic bioconjugates,18,19,30−32 whereby the
protein is conjugated with a hydrophobic polymer, have shown potential
in improving the protein activity (such as inhibition of tumor cell
growth),33 although in some cases the opposite
effect was observed.34,35 Similarly, stimuli-responsive
bioconjugates (frequently referred to as “smart” bioconjugates21) are often studied as potential “on/off”
systems,36−38 whereby the solvation of the polymer dictates the
protein activity.39 In addition to the
effect on protein activity, bioconjugates with an amphiphilic character
(often referred to as “giant amphiphiles”) form elaborate
nanostructures as a result of their self-assembly in water.30,32,34,40,41

In building protein–polymer
macromolecules, several design
decisions must be considered. First, the strategy to attach the polymer
to the protein must be defined. The most used conjugation method involves
the functionalization of all available natural amino acid target moieties
on the protein,42−45 commonly lysine or cysteine residues. Other approaches have targeted
the N-terminus of the protein,46,47 while in other examples a single available functional amino acid
is targeted.32,48−51 These synthetic approaches to
decorating proteins have been extensively presented in numerous noteworthy
reviews.6,7,52−63 A recurring limitation in a large number of the reports in the literature
is that covalent coupling leads to a heterogeneous mixture of products
with varying conjugation degrees. This has been found to be related
to the polymer molecular weight,64 polymer
docking location onto the protein, and also heterogeneities in the
protein which affect the availability of the modification sites,65 thus highlighting the need for complete control
over the conjugation site.20

Recent
studies have shown that the introduction of noncanonical
amino acids (ncAAs) into a functional protein expands the available
chemistries for conjugation,66 allowing
a higher degree of precision and minimization of side-reactions and
byproducts.67 In one approach, pioneered
by Tirrell and colleagues,68−72 all natural amino acids (typically methionine, isoleucine, or leucine)
are globally replaced by a ncAA. While powerful, changing all occurrences
of a natural amino acid in a protein may unfavorably affect protein
folding and activity. In addition, the chemical diversity introduced via ncAAs in this procedure is limited since the ncAA must
be a close analogue of the natural amino acid it replaces. In an alternative
approach, ncAAs are quantitatively installed at defined sites in a
protein through genetic code expansion. The most widely used strategy
for expanding the genetic code is based on the amber suppression technique
using orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs.73 Many seminal works from Schultz and others have
established and driven the field forward, and more than 150 different
ncAAs have been site-specifically incorporated into proteins to date.66,74−76 These ncAAs normally carry functional moieties (e.g.,
aryl-azide) that do not exist in the canonical 20 amino acids and
that are easy to chemically modify (e.g., using copper-catalyzed alkyne–azide
cycloaddition77−81), although the success of the modification also relies on the conjugation
site.82 A notable example is the incorporation
of a polymerization-initiating ncAA into green fluorescent protein
(GFP) and the subsequent growth of a polymer from the surface of the
protein.83 Such modifications can thus
allow conjugation with polymers which, as previously mentioned, could
protect the protein from degradation or prevent the polymer interfering
with the protein activity. Another significant advantage of this approach
is that it can allow the introduction of ncAAs without altering the
net charge or the redox potential of the protein, as is often the
result of functionalizing lysine and cysteine residues, respectively.

After deciding how to precisely link proteins to polymers, the
second key design consideration is polymer conjugation strategy. In
one approach, the presynthesized polymer can be “grafted to”
the protein. The major drawback of this approach stems from the difficulty
removing the high-molecular-weight byproducts (i.e., excess polymer).
An alternative strategy is to “graft from”, where the
protein is functionalized with a moiety that participates in the polymer
synthesis, such as a polymerization initiator/mediator. Recently,
such “grafting from” approaches have become more accessible
since the development of reversible deactivation radical polymerizations,57,58 such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible
addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization,
and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP) which allow the reaction
to occur under conditions suitable for retention of the protein stability.84 However, “grafting to” is still
a popular conjugation method as it allows the fine-tuning of the molecular
characteristics of the polymer before its conjugation.

Recently,
several reports have begun to make possible new types
of protein–polymer bioconjugates using GFP as a model protein.85 Nolte and co-workers, for example, studied the
self-assembly of conjugated biohybrid copolymers comprising GFP and
poly[(oligo ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate] (PEGMA) and showed
that the resulting biohybrid amphiphiles were thermoresponsive.86 However, their study was limited to the use
of natural amino acid handles for conjugation (i.e., cysteine) and
was insufficient to study the impact of multiple polymers attached
to the compact protein core. Similarly, Olsen et al. reported the
conjugation of thermoresponsive polymers with a GFP via thiol–maleimide
ligation. The resulting bioconjugates formed micelles when the solution
temperature was increased.87 In another
example, Matyjaszewski and co-workers reported the incorporation of pAzF into a GFP and its subsequent bioconjugation with a
PEG containing two alkyne functionalities. This resulted in a “step-growth”
formation of micron-sized fibers that were attributed to the dimerization
of GFP.88 This was a significant advance
in the study of properties of polymer–protein bioconjugates
and it demonstrates the infinite potential applications that will
emerge once more intricate polymers are explored in such systems.
However, our understanding of how the location on the protein surface
of conjugation can affect the resultant properties of the protein–polymer
bioconjugate material remains incomplete.

Here, we sought to
build on these recent reports to demonstrate
a simple bioconjugate protein–polymer system that would allow
us to study the impact of site-specific conjugation on self-assembly
and responsiveness. Our goal was to produce and study biomacromolecules
comprising superfolder GFP (sfGFP) decorated with temperature-responsive
poly[(oligo ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PEGMA) chains
of different molecular weights on more than one site, by copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition reaction (CuAAc). Similarly to PEG,
PEGMA has been shown to be biocompatible33 and, additionally, exhibits a lower critical solution temperature
(LCST) in water.89 Our study involved three
steps. First, the sfGFP molecules were functionalized with azide groups
(at amino acid residues 2, 216, or 2 and 216). Second, the reactive
azide moieties were conjugated with an alkyne-containing PEGMA synthesized
by RAFT polymerization. Third, we characterized the reversible transition
of the protein–polymer structures from a water-soluble to a
water-insoluble state upon heating above a critical temperature (namely
the cloud point). Our results showed that the resultant structures
had properties of both the fluorescent sfGFP and the temperature-responsive
PEGMA (Figure 1). Additionally, we explored
the effect of different attachment positions on the protein on the
cloud point of the bioconjugate using turbidimetry, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis.

followed for the synthesis of sfGFP-PEGMA bioconjugates via the engineering of three sfGFP analogues with T216,
S2T216, and S2 site modification with pAzF before
the CuAAc of alkyne-functional PEGMA (three different molecular weights).
Upon an increase of the solution temperature, all bioconjugates were
found to aggregate.

Results and Discussion
We began our study by producing the p-azidophenylalanine
(pAzF) sfGFP labeled reagents. To incorporate pAzF into sfGFP, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were first co-transformed with the pEVOL-pAzF plasmid
that encodes the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/suppressor tRNA pair90 and an appropriate mutant pY71-sfGFP plasmid
with amber codon (TAG) at positions of S2, T216, or S2/T216. These
locations were chosen as the S2 and T216 residues are located at opposite
ends of the protein’s barrel structure on flexible loops that
do not affect sfGFP folding. In addition, this design allowed us to
introduce two conjugation points on opposite sides of the protein
structure (Figure 1; see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information (SI) for more information
on the sites of modification).

Then, the desired sfGFP proteins
were overexpressed and purified
from the BL21 (DE3) cells, noting that T7 RNA polymerase, which drives
sfGFP transcription in pY71-sfGFP, was expressed from a DE3 λ
prophage under an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG)-inducible lacI promoter in BL21(DE3) (see SI for methods). Protein expression yields were
estimated to be ∼20 mg/L by comparison of purified protein
to standards of bovine serum albumin at known concentrations. With
the purified sfGFP variants in hand, we carried out top-down mass
spectrometry (i.e., MS analysis of whole intact proteins) to detect
and provide semiquantitative information for the incorporation of pAzF into sfGFP. Figure 2 shows the
32+ charge state of sfGFP and clearly illustrates mass shifts corresponding
to the incorporation of each of the specifically incorporated pAzF residues. Site-specific incorporation of pAzF, as detected by MS, was greater than 95% in all samples (Figure 2), noting that the experimental and theoretical
protein masses were in good agreement (see SI, Table S2). In summary, we achieved efficient, high yielding, and
pure site-specific pAzF incorporation into sfGFP
at two different sites at opposite ends of the protein barrel structure.

Figure 2 Mass spectrum
of the 32+ charge state of sfGFP obtained via top-down
mass spectrometry illustrating site-specific incorporation of pAzF
at single and multiple sites. Major peaks in each spectrum coincide
with the theoretical peaks for each species and have been highlighted.
Smaller peaks to the right of the colored peaks are due to oxidation
of the protein—a common electrochemical reaction occurring
during electrospray ionization.91 Water
loss events from the intact sfGFP are detected at minor levels to
the left of the major (colored) peaks. Note that the start (N-terminal)
methionine of sfGFP is usually cleaved post-translationally by methionine
aminopeptidase present in the E. coli proteome. However, the presence of an unnatural amino acid at S2
appears to hinder this enzyme (For more detail, see SI Table S2).

Once the production of pure modified proteins by mass spectrometry
was confirmed, the accessibility of the reactive azide moieties was
established by exploration of a CuAAC reaction with an alkyne-containing
rhodamine B fluorescent dye (1) (see SI). All protein–dye bioconjugates were found to contain
the rhodamine B dye by PAGE analysis (see SI, Figure S3), although LC-MS suggested incomplete conjugation (see SI, Figure S4). This highlighted that the two
modified positions on the sfGFP were accessible for reaction using
CuAAC.

For the conjugation of the protein with a polymer, an
alkyne-containing
chain transfer agent (CTA, 2) was chosen for the RAFT
polymerization of OEGMA300 (Figure 1). Three polymers varying in molecular weight (Table 1) were synthesized by changes in monomer feed and reaction
time (see SI for synthetic procedure).
Overall, the molecular weight distribution of the polymers was fairly
low, while the crucial presence of the alkyne end-group was confirmed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see SI, Figures S6 and S7). It should be noted that this CTA was chosen
as it bears the alkyne functionality on the R-group, thus permitting
the bioconjugation regardless of the thiocarbonylthio bond stability.92

Conjugation of the alkyne-functional
polymers with the azide-bearing
proteins was carried out in Tris buffer solution using copper sulfate
as the catalyst, to make a total of nine protein–polymer structures
(three sfGFP constructs plus three different polymer molecular weights).
Each bioconjugate was then purified by preparative size exclusion
chromatography (SEC), which allowed for assessment of the efficiency
of the reaction (Figure 3A). When compared
to the unmodified sfGFP, all samples were found to exhibit higher
molecular weight peaks, eluting at lower volumes, which were attributed
to the polymer–protein bioconjugates. It should also be noted
that the bioconjugate retention volume decreased with increasing polymer
molecular weight, suggesting that higher molecular weight polymers
resulted in higher molecular weight bioconjugates. These data confirmed
that decoration of site selective sfGFPs with PEGMA polymers of different
molecular weights at both positions 2 and 216 was possible.

To confirm the successful formation of the protein–polymer
bioconjugates, we next carried out SDS-PAGE analysis on the sfGFP-PEGMA
bioconjugates following purification by preparative SEC and sample
concentration. Comparison of the unconjugated sfGFP and the product
of the CuAAc reactions with the different molecular weight polymers
showed that the latter exhibit a significantly broader band at lower
mobility, consistent with the presence of the bioconjugate (Figure 3B–D). In the case of PEGMA-1 and PEGMA-2,
the broad band with the highest mobility matches that of the neat
polymer and is attributed to unreacted polymer chains. This is especially
prominent for the PEGMA-1 reactions (Figure 3B), which is due to the fact that removal from the bioconjugate is
more challenging for the lowest molecular weight polymer sample. In
the case of PEGMA-3, it is hard to determine if there is unconjugated
polymer, as the broad polymer band overlaps with the molecular weight
assigned to the bioconjugate. However, it was noted that upon heating
of these bioconjugate samples, a precipitate was formed which was
determined to be unreacted PEGMA (see SI, Figure S8) and hence removal of this by filtration readily allowed
for the removal of any unconjugated polymer.

Following production of protein–polymer
bioconjugates, we
then carried out a series of characterization experiments to assess
the impact of conjugation at different sites on the protein surface
on the macromolecule properties of the bioconjugates. First, the activity
of the protein–polymer bioconjugates was compared with that
of the wild type nonconjugated sfGFP, in order to confirm that polymer
conjugation does not affect the inherent fluorescence of the protein.93 To assess activity, we determined the quantum
yield of the sfGFP fluorescence before and after conjugation (Figure 4).94 Using fluorescein
free acid as the standard, sfGFP was found to have a quantum yield
of 0.613 (±0.016). Similarly, the quantum yield of the bioconjugated
sfGFP with PEGMA-2 at the T216 position (sfGFP(T216)-PEGMA2) was found
to be 0.638 (±0.014). The comparable quantum yields for the bioconjugate
and the sfGFP protein suggest that the fluorophore of the protein
is not affected by polymer conjugation, thus confirming that careful
selection of the conjugation site (which is enabled through the site-specific
incorporation of a ncAA) allows for the retention of the protein activity.
It should be noted that the conjugation did not have an effect on
the sfGFP fluorescence even at elevated temperatures, as both the
bioconjugate and the wild type sfGFP showed similar fluorescence emissions
when cycling the temperature between 25 and 70 °C (see SI, Figure S9). Although we did not test the
activity of all the protein–polymer constructs, our data supports
an emerging wave of examples showing the ability to maintain protein
activity in protein–polymer bioconjugates prepared using site-specifically
incorporated ncAAs.88,93

emission spectra in relative
units (r.u.) for the sfGFP and the sfGFP PEGMA-2 bioconjugate with pAzF at position T216 (sfGFP(T216)-PEGMA2), showing retention
of the protein fluorescence upon conjugation.

We then set out to explore the properties of this series
of bioconjugates.
First, we wanted to investigate how the conjugation of a temperature-responsive
polymer at different residues in the protein affects the overall bioconjugate
thermal properties. PEGMA is a temperature-responsive polymer with
its transition temperature depending on the PEG side chain length
and the overall polymer molecular weight.89,95 Using turbidimetry, the cloud point of the neat polymers and all
nine bioconjugates in Tris buffer was evaluated (Figure 5). As expected due to the hydrophobicity of the polymer end
group, the cloud point of the low-molecular-weight PEGMA-1 was at
26.4 °C; however, PEGMA-2 and PEGMA-3 exhibited a hydrophilic–hydrophobic
transition at higher temperatures (57.8 and 64.5 °C, respectively).

Figure 5 Cloud
point curves for the three PEGMA solutions (black lines:
squares for PEGMA-1, circles for PEGMA-2, and triangles for PEGMA-3)
and their corresponding bioconjugates with the grafting position being
sfGFP(S2) (red lines), sfGFP(T216) (green lines), and both sfGFP(S2T216)
(blue lines), sfGFP (purple line) are also shown for comparison. Note
that all measurements are averages of three runs with a standard deviation
of ±1 °C.

In the case of the proteins
conjugated with PEGMA-1, the cloud
point was found to be significantly higher than that of the neat polymer
alone, which was attributed to the fact that the protein provides
better water solubility than the end group of the polymer itself,
thus rendering it more hydrophilic. For the PEGMA-2 and PEGMA-3 bioconjugates,
the cloud point was slightly higher than that of the homopolymers.
While the transition temperature of the bioconjugates varied from
61 to 67 °C there is a distinct effect on the observed transition
temperature through variation of the polymer molecular weight and
the conjugation site. As such, the shorter polymer (PEGMA-1) results
in bioconjugates that regardless of the conjugation site become insoluble
at almost the same temperature (63–65 °C). Increasing
the molecular weight of the conjugated polymer (PEGMA-2) results in
the hybrid that is conjugated at the S2 position (sfGFP(S2)-PEGMA2)
to transition at a lower temperature, compared to that conjugated
at the T216 position (sfGFP(T216)-PEGMA2) (ca. 4 °C lower). Although
both positions are located in the flexible loops of the sfGFP barrel,
we suspect that the local environment of conjugation affects the ability
of the PEGMA chains to collapse upon heating above their cloud point.
This is again observed when comparing the two conjugation sites for
the larger (PEGMA-3) polymers (with a ca. 3 °C difference between
sfGFP(S2)-PEGMA3 and sfGFP(T216)-PEGMA3). The consistently higher
transition temperature for proteins conjugated at the T216 may be
attributed to this site being located in a more highly charged region
of the protein compared to the S2 site. Note that as expected the
higher molecular weight polymer, PEGMA-3, always afforded bioconjugates
with higher transition temperatures compared to the PEGMA-2 conjugates.

Interestingly, the transition temperature for the double-conjugated
sfGFPs with the PEGMA-1 and PEGMA-2 polymers (sfGFP(S2T216)-PEGMA1
and sfGFP(S2T216)-PEGMA2) occurs at a temperature intermediate to
the observed transition of the single modified protein bioconjugates.
In contrast, the transition temperature for the higher molecular weight
polymer (PEGMA-3) conjugated in two positions (sfGFP(S2T216)-PEGMA3)
is slightly lower than that of the two single-functionalized proteins
by ca. 1 °C (for sfGFP(S2)-PEGMA3) and 3 °C (for sfGFP(T216)-PEGMA3).
This can be attributed to the two polymer chains reaching a critical
molecular weight that allows them to interact and thus decrease the
effective transition temperature, as seen in other similar bioconjugate
systems.96

The increase in turbidity
and the absence of macroscopic precipitation
upon heating the bioconjugates above the transition temperature suggests
the formation of dispersed aggregates whereby the hydrophobic part
consists of the polymer and the hydrophilic is the protein segment
of the bioconjugate. The bioconjugates were thus characterized by
dynamic light scattering (DLS) over a range of temperatures (Figure 6), whereby upon heating the hydrodynamic size of
the bioconjugates dramatically increased but the unmodified sfGFP
retained its original size. This supports the hypothesis that due
to the now hydrophobic character of the polymer and the amphiphilic
character of the overall hybrid, the bioconjugates self-assemble at
elevated temperature. It should however be noted that large aggregate
populations were also observed by DLS—regardless of the temperature
of the measurement (see SI, Figures S10–S11)—attributed
to the presence of aggregates which were also observed in neat buffer.
In an attempt to further confirm the formation of bioconjugate assemblies,
the heated samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy
(with the sample preparation taking place at 70 °C, see SI, Figure S12). Unfortunately, only large ill-defined
aggregates could be identified which were attributed to the difficulty
in sample preparation at elevated temperature.

Figure 6 Dependence of the hydrodynamic
diameter of sfGFP and the sfGFP(T216)-PEGMA2
bioconjugate on temperature, as determined by DLS analysis.

To gain more information on the
solution structure of the protein–polymer
bioconjugates, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments were
conducted. Data was collected for the sfGFP alone, as well as all
the bioconjugates at room and elevated temperature (at 25 and 65 °C).
Measurements were performed using dilute solutions (in all cases less
than 0.2 mg/mL) to minimize the amount of unwanted aggregation. Fitting
analysis (see SI for details) was performed
to determine the radius of gyration Rg and shape of the bioconjugate (see Tables S3
and S4). As expected, at 25 °C the bioconjugates all had
a larger size than the sfGFP, and furthermore the size of the bioconjugates
in solution increased as the molecular weight of the conjugated polymer
increased.

A Kratky plot (q2I(q) vs q) for each sample
was derived,
from the SAXS data, in order to further analyze the bioconjugate morphology.
Such plots are often used to emphasize the differences between compact
objects such as globular, structured proteins and that of a random
chain, such as an unfolded protein.97 A
bell-shaped curve is obtained in the first case whereas a plateau
is found for the second case, and depending on the local rigidity
of the chain, an increase in slope as q increases
may also be observed.97 Such a plot however
suffers from limitations as it does not allow direct comparison of
scattering profiles of objects of different sizes. Moreover, the Kratky
plot of partially folded proteins still shows bell-shaped curves owing
to the presence of structured regions in the protein. To obviate this
problem, a dimensionless Kratky plot was utilized in this work: the
intensity I(q) is normalized to
the forward scattering intensity I(0), which allows
comparison of samples of different molecular weights as I(0) is proportional to the molecular weight; q is
normalized to the radius of gyration of the protein, which makes the
angular scale independent of the protein size.98 Analysis of the dimensionless Kratky plots at 25 °C
indicated that the conjugation of the polymer does not affect the
structured domains of the protein for all of the PEGMA bioconjugates,
as the plots at low x-axis values are similar before
and after conjugation (see SI, Figure S13).
The GFP plots show a symmetrical bell-shaped curve as well as a horizontal
asymptote at high x-axis values, characteristic of
a folded protein. The presence of more unstructured domains after
conjugation is proposed as the plots for the bioconjugates appear
to have a higher gradient at high qRg values
(qRg &gt; 3). By SAXS analysis, no significant
difference in solution size or shape for the bioconjugates with different
site modifications is observed (see SI,
Table S3). However, the length of the polymer which is conjugated
to the protein has an effect on the solution structure of the resultant
bioconjugate, in that the wrapping of the bioconjugated polymers around
the protein is more efficient for the longest polymer, PEGMA-3, as
observed by an increase of the Rg and
a more spherical morphology after bioconjugation (see SI, Table S3).

The dimensionless Kratky
plots at elevated temperature 65 °C
(close to or above the cloud point of the bioconjugates) show that
the sfGFP is equally or more folded in its native form than when it
is conjugated to the polymers (see SI,
Figure S14). Moreover, the conjugation of the polymers increases the
number of unstructured domains as expected for the conjugation of
a polymer with a random coil conformation in a collapsed state. The
bioconjugates display a more elongated morphology than the sfGFP at
elevated temperature. As the sfGFP by itself does not exhibit a more
elongated morphology, the elongation is attributed to the polymer
chains. This was also confirmed from analysis of the SAXS curves of
the polymers at different temperatures (see SI, Figure S15).

In summary, we have shown the successful incorporation
of an azide-functional
ncAA into sfGFP at multiple locations, synthesizing three sfGFP analogues
which could be readily bioconjugated with one or two alkyne-functional
PEGMA polymers. Our work described the combination of chemical and
biological approaches to produce synthetic protein–polymer
bioconjugates having new structures and reversible self-assembly properties.
The resulting bioconjugates exhibited no loss in fluorescence, while
an increase in temperature resulted in the reversible increase in
turbidity of the bioconjugates solutions, suggesting the formation
of aggregates. Additionally, the transition temperature was found
to be affected by the molecular weight of the polymer as well as the
location of the polymer conjugation. Finally, we demonstrated that
using the same responsive polymer and conjugating to different sites
of a protein leads to no difference in bioconjugate shape, but it
does lead to a discernible difference in thermal properties for the bioconjugates. Our work thus
highlights that site-selective polymer conjugation, which is possible
using protein engineering alongside common conjugation approaches,
can be used to fine-tune functional properties of polymer–protein
bioconjugates.

Improvements in modified protein yields will
open the way to even
broader applications. For example, amber suppression technologies in vivo are still generally limited to expression of proteins
containing ncAAs incorporated into a single instance or few instances
within a polypeptide chain.99,100 New genomically recoded
strains101 lacking release factor 1, cell-free
approaches,75,91,93,102,103 and the ability
to site-specifically incorporate multiple types of ncAAs per protein
with high efficiencies promise to make possible novel synthesis approaches
for unique polymeric materials with atomic-scale resolution over composition,
architecture, and functionality.
