As
an important and necessary step of sampling biological specimens,
the separation of malignant cells from a mixed population of cells
usually requires sophisticated instruments and/or expensive reagents.
For health care in the developing regions, there is a need for an
inexpensive sampling method to capture tumor cells for rapid and accurate
diagnosis. Here we show that an underexplored generic difference—overexpression
of ectophosphatases—between cancer and normal cells triggers
the d-tyrosine phosphate decorated magnetic nanoparticles
(Fe3O4-p(d-Tyr)) to adhere selectively
on cancer cells upon catalytic dephosphorylation, which enables magnetic
separation of cancer cells from mixed population of cells (e.g., cocultured
cancer cell (HeLa-GFP) and stromal cells (HS-5)). Moreover, the Fe3O4-p(d-Tyr) nanoparticles also selectively
inhibit cancer cells in the coculture. As a general method to broadly
target cancer cells without highly specific ligand–receptor
interactions (e.g., antibodies), the use of an enzymatic reaction
to spatiotemporally modulate the state of various nanostructures in
cellular environments will ultimately lead to the development of new
theranostic applications of nanomaterials.

This communication
reports the
application of enzymatic transformation (ET) of a simple amino acid
(d-tyrosine phosphate) decorated magnetic
nanoparticles for selectively sorting and inhibiting cancer cells.
Cell sorting, the isolation of certain types of cells from mixed cell
population of organs or tissues, has become an increasingly important
sampling method that has already contributed to many advances in biology
and medicine.1,2 While the capture of bacteria
is relatively easy by the magnetic nanoparticles decorated by a readily
accessible ligand (e.g., vancomycin),3 the
sorting of mammalian cells requires more complicated and expensive
instruments and reagents. Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS),4 the most widely used cell sorting method, uses
expensive hardware and requires labeling the cells of interest by
fluorescent antibodies or cellular proteins.2,5 The
current magnetic cell sorting still requires cell specific antibodies
to be conjugated to the magnetic beads, which is a less well-defined
process due to the nonspecific binding of proteins to the beads. Moreover,
the development of inexpensive cell sorting method, without using
expensive instrument (e.g., FACS) and/or reagents (e.g., antibodies),
will contribute to low-cost diagnostics, which would be particularly
attractive for developing regions that lack resources.6

Encouraged by the seminal work on the DNA linked
gold nanoparticles
to report DNA hybridization7 and the recent
work on the dispersion of peptide coated gold nanoparticles to detect
a specific enzyme,8 and based on our unexpected
observation of selective formation of pericellular nanonets on cancer
cells upon dephosphorylation of d-peptides catalyzed by ectophosphatases,9 we decide to use ET to trigger the adhesion of
iron oxide nanoparticles on cells for sorting cancer cells. We choose
enzymatic reactions over antibodies to distinguish cancer and normal
cells for three reasons: (i) the overexpression of ectophosphatases
on the surface of cancer cells represents a generic difference between
many cancer and normal cells;10,11 (ii) the omission of
antibodies reduces the cost and increases the stability of agents;
(iii) being highly efficient and specific, enzymatic reactions offer
a simple, fast, yet fundamentally new way to modulate the surface
chemistry of magnetic nanoparticles12 for
spatiotemporally defining the magnetic nanoparticles in cellular environment,
which is less explored.

As illustrated in Scheme 1, we decorate
iron oxide nanoparticles with a simple amino acid, d-tyrosine
phosphate, to engineer the biofunctional magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4-p(d-Tyr), MNP_pY). Ectophosphatases
(e.g., placental alkaline phosphatase (ALPP) overexpressed on the
surface of cancer cells11) catalytically
dephosphorylate the phosphate-bearing magnetic nanoparticles (MNP_pY)
to form tyrosine coated magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4-(d-Tyr), MNP_Y). Our microscopic studies confirm
that, upon enzymatic transformation, MNP_Ys adhere selectively on
the surface of cancer cells, which allows a small magnet to capture
the cancer cells from a mixture of cancer and stromal cells (Scheme 2). Moreover, cell viability study indicates that
MNP_pY selectively inhibits the growth of cancer cells (e.g., HeLa-GFP),
with an IC50 of 12 μg/mL, in the coculture that mimics
tumor microenvironment.13 As a new approach
for selectively targeting and sorting cancer cells, this exceptionally
simple method not only illustrates a straightforward, selective, and
inexpensive procedure for sorting cancer cells, but will also lead
to the application of nanoparticles, based on the spatiotemporal distribution
of a specific enzyme, for disease diagnosis and treatment.

Scheme 1 Enzymatic
Transformation of Magnetic Nanoparticles for Selectively
Sorting Cancer Cells
Scheme 2 Procedure for Separating the Cancer Cells from a Coculture
of Cancer
and Stromal Cells
The synthesis of MNP_pY is fast and straightforward: We
directly
modify the well-established iron oxide nanoparticles,14 which are surface-functionalized with oleic acid groups
and commercially available,15 with d-tyrosine phosphate by using N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS). After rinsing three times with methanol and water, respectively,
we can collect the final MNP_pY with centrifugation and disperse them
in water for use. Transmission electron microscopy confirms that there
is little morphological change in the iron oxide nanoparticles before
and after functionalization by d-tyrosine phosphates (Supporting Information Figure S115). The quantification of phosphate on MNP_pY by using the
phosphate assay indicates that, on average, there are at least 124 d-tyrosine phosphate molecules on each MNP_pY nanoparticle (Supporting Information Figure S215).

As shown in stage I in Scheme 2, the sorting
of cancer cells from the cell mixture is exceptionally simple. After
seeding about 1.0 × 106 HeLa-GFP16 and HS-517 cells per culture
dish (6 cm) overnight, we add MNP_pY (40 μg/mL) to incubate
the coculture cells for 4 h. After removing the growth medium containing
nanoparticles and rinsing the cells three times, we use trypsin solution
(0.25% (w/v) in 0.53 mM EDTA) to detach the cells. Following aspiration
of the cells to obtain the cell suspension by gently pipetting, we
place a small magnet outside the Eppendorf tube for 1 min to divide
the cell suspension into two portions: supernatant and extraction.
After centrifugation and rinsing of the supernatant or extraction,
the pellets of cells are reseeded onto confocal Petri dishes (stage
II, Scheme 2) for imaging which acts as a way
to verify the results of the sorting.

Figure 1 shows the results of the sorting
of HeLa-GFP cells from the coculture of HeLa-GFP and HS-5 cells that
mimics tumor microenvironment.17 After
the treatment by MNP_pY and the magnetic capture, most of the cells
from the extraction portion exhibit bright green fluorescence, indicating
that they are cancer cells (i.e., HeLa-GFP). Only few HS-5 cells exist
in the extraction, which may result from the intercellular interactions
between cancer cells and stromal cells. On the contrary, the majority
of the cells from the supernatant lack green fluorescence, indicating
that they are HS-5 stromal cells. The bright field images (Supporting Information Figure S315) show that many magnetic nanoparticles (MNP_Y) adhere on
the surface of the cancer cells extracted by the magnet, which likely
result from the dephosphorylation of d-tyrosine phosphate
on the iron oxide nanoparticles by the overexpressed ectophosphatases
on the surface of cancer cells. To confirm that ET is responsible
for the capture of the cancer cells, we use MNP as a control and repeat
the procedure shown in Scheme 2. After treatment
by MNP and magnetic sorting, almost no cells are observed from the
extraction portion after reseeding, but the corresponding supernatant
(i.e., from the sample treated by MNP) contains (almost) all the fluorescent
(HeLa-GFP) and nonfluorescent (HS-5) cells. In agreement with this
observation, after the incubation of the cells with the control iron
oxide nanoparticles (MNP), the bright field images reveal that none
of the MNP adheres on the surface of cancer or stromal cells (Supporting Information Figure S315). These results, together, indicate that MNP_pYs, being
catalytically dephosphorylated by the ectophosphatases overexpressed
on the cancer cells, are suitable for magnetically and selectively
sorting cancer cells from coculture of cancer and stromal cells.

Figure 1 Overlaid
bright field and fluorescent images (20× dry objective
lens) of the extraction and supernatant portions of cells after adding
MNP_pY (Left) and MNP (Right) to the coculture of HeLa-GFP and HS-5
cells for magnetic sorting. Cells were incubated with the growth medium,
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), containing 40 μg/mL
nanoparticles for 4 h (top: the cells extracted by magnet; bottom:
the cells remaining in supernatant). The initial number of cells is
1.0 × 106 per 6 cm culture dish. The scale bar is
100 μm.

To further confirm the
selectivity of MNP_pY toward cancer cells,
we use HeLa-GFP and HS-5 cells, separately, as the control cells and
repeat the procedure shown in Scheme 2. The
overlaid bright field and fluorescent images in Figure 2A indicate that, after the cells were incubated with MNP_pY
and subjected to magnetic sorting, the extraction portion only contains
HeLa-GFP cells (as proven by the bright green fluorescence from the
cancer cells). The bright field images (Supporting
Information Figure S415) also confirm
that MNP-Ys adhere on the surface of HeLa-GFP cells. The incubation
of MNP_pY with HS-5 cells hardly results in HS-5 cells in the extraction
portion, and there are no nanoparticles on the HS-5 cells in the supernatant
(Supporting Information Figure S515). Similar to the observation in the incubation
of MNP with the coculture, the use of MNP on separately cultured HeLa-GFP
or HS-5 captures neither GFP-HeLa nor HS-5 cells (Figure 2A) in the extractions.

To quantify the efficiency
of cell capture of MNP_pY, we count
the cell numbers in the extraction or the supernatant. As shown in
Figure 2B, the addition of 100 μg of
MNP_pY in the coculture of 6.6 × 105 total cells (with
the initial ratio of HeLa-GFP and HS-5 cells in coculture to be 1:10),
14% of the cells are captured from the mixed cells, which indicates
that this method separates over 90% of the cancer cells from the coculture.
We reach this conclusion because (i) MNP_pY hardly leads to capture
any HS-5 cells (i.e., less than 1%, Figure 2B); (ii) HeLa-GFP cells proliferate faster than HS-5 cells do; (iii)
the addition of 100 μg of MNP_pY in the culture of initially
6.0 × 105 HeLa-GFP cells allows the capture of 3.0
× 105 cells (about 3000 cells/μg MNP_pY, which
is consistent with VSM measurement (vide infra)).
In addition, to further demonstrate that ET of MNP_pY is the key factor for selective sorting of cancer
cells, we utilize MNP_Y, which results from the treatment of MNP_pY
with ALP, to incubate with cells and repeat the procedure shown in
Scheme 2. According to cell viability test,
MNP_Y itself shows little cytotoxicity to cells (Supporting Information Figure S6A15). As shown in Supporting Information Figure
S6B,15 almost no cells are observed
from the extraction portion while all cells remain in the corresponding
supernatant (Supporting Information Figure S6C). These results confirm that, although the treatment of MNP_pY with
phosphatases will generate MNP_Y, it is ET of MNP_pY by overexpressed
ectophosphatases at the surface of cancer cells, not MNP_Y itself,
that triggers the magnetic separation and selective inhibition of
cancer cells from coculture circumstance.

Figure 2 (A) Overlaid bright field
and fluorescent microscopy images of
the HeLa-GFP cells (top) and HS-5 cells (bottom) magnetically captured
by incubating the cells with MNP_pY (left) and MNP (right). The scale

or supernatant of all the cells collected after the treatment by 40
μg/mL MNP_pY and the magnetic capture. (C) M–H curves
of MNP_pY or MNP on the cells after incubation with HeLa-GFP, HS-5,
or the coculture of HeLa-GFP and HS-5 cells. (D) Relative amounts
of nanoparticles remaining on the cells.

We study magnetic properties of the iron oxide nanoparticles
by
using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) for quantifying the amount
of MNP_Y remaining on the cells. As shown in Figure 2C, 200 μg of MNP_pY has the magnetic moment of 11.0
memu, which can serve as a reference for estimating the magnetic nanoparticles
on the cells. After incubation with coculture of HeLa-GFP and HS-5
cells with same amount of MNP_pY for 4 h, the magnetic moment of nanoparticles
remaining on all of the cells is decreased to 7.6 memu, which is around
69% of all the MNP_pY before the treatment (Figure 2D). Moreover, when the MNP_pYs are incubated with only the
HeLa-GFP cells, the moment of MNP_Y on the cell surface is 7.0 memu,
suggesting that 63% of nanoparticles adhere to the HeLa-GFP cells.
This quantity is comparable to the amount of MNP_Y on the HeLa-GFP
in the coculture. On the other hand, the incubation of MNP_pY with
HS-5 cells only results in the residue of the magnetic moment of 1.0
memu, which is 9% of all the MNP_pY before the treatment, thus confirming
that HS-5 cells hardly absorb MNP_pY. These results are compatible
with the optical images of the pellets collected with the treatment
of nanoparticles (Supporting Information Figure
S715). According to cell numbers
and the magnetic moments, we estimate the capture efficiency to be
about 7000 cells/μg MNP_pY, which is comparable to the efficiency
obtained by counting numbers of captured cells. The measurement of
the cells treated only by MNPs (Figure 2C and
D) confirms that there are few control iron oxide nanoparticles (MNP)
remaining on the surface of any cells. While nonselective internalization
of MNPs by cells could lead to the reduction of selectivity, the use
of d-tyrosine and relatively short incubation (4 h), in fact,
minimizes the internalization of MNPs.

Figure 3 Relative cell viability
(determined by counting the cell numbers;
100% represents the control, i.e., 0 μg/mL of the compound)
of coculture of HeLa-GFP and HS-5 cells; HeLa-GFP cells; and HS-5
cells incubated with MNP_pY at the concentrations of 4 and 40 μg/mL.
The initial number of cells is 1.0 × 104/well.

Besides selectively capturing
cancer cells in coculture, MNP_pY
selectively inhibits the proliferation of cancer cells. As shown in
Figure 3, being incubated with different concentrations
of MNP_pY, the viability of coculture of HeLa-GFP and HS-5 cells (measured
by counting the cell number) is much lower than that of the control.
When the concentration is larger than 20 μg/mL, the cell viability
remains almost the same, which indicates that the stromal cells are
still alive while most of the cancer cells are killed by MNP_pY (Supporting Information Figure S815). This result agrees with the viability of the homogeneous
cells treated by MNP_pY. After being treated by different concentrations
of MNP_pY, the proliferation of HeLa-GFP cells shows significant inhibition,
especially when the concentration of MNP_pY is larger than 10 μg/mL.
Cell viability study indicates that MNP_pY inhibits the growth of
HeLa-GFP cells with the IC50 value of 12 μg/mL (10.2
μM tyrosine phosphate) at 48 h, which is comparable to that
of cisplatin-loaded gold nanoparticles (6 μM).18 On the contrary, after being treated by the same concentrations
of MNP_pY, HS-5 cells maintain almost the same level of proliferation
with the control, which indicates that MNP_pY has little cytotoxicity
to the stromal cells (e.g., HS-5). When HeLa-GFP cells are treated
with 40 μg/mL of MNP_pY and different concentrations of l-phenylalanine (e.g., 1, 5, 10 mM), a known inhibitor of ALPP,19 more than 60% of cells are alive (Supporting Information Figure S915). In addition, the incubation of MNP with HeLa-GFP or HS-5
cells hardly inhibits the cell proliferation (Supporting Information Figure S1015). These results indicate that ALPP is largely responsible for converting
MNP_pY to MNP_Y on cancer cell surface for selectively sorting and
inhibiting cancer cells.

In conclusion, this work, for the first
time, demonstrates the
use of enzymatic transformation (ET) of magnetic nanoparticles for
selectively sorting and inhibiting cancer cells without involving
specific ligand–receptor interactions or the use of antibodies.
The high capture efficiency of cancer cells from the coculture demonstrates
the expression level of enzymes as a new paradigm for exploring strategies
that target cancer cells. While the overexpression of ectophosphatases
(e.g., ALPP) represents a generic difference between cancer and normal
cells, there are certain cancer cells expressing normal levels of
ALPP to render MNP_pY ineffective. This apparent limitation should
be solvable by identifying other genuine enzymatic differences between
cancer and normal cells. This strategy relies on a specific enzymatic
reaction (e.g., catalytic dephosphorylation), but not specific enzyme
inhibition, to target cancer cells selectively. The same principle
should be useful for developing a relatively inexpensive, simple,
and selective method for sampling other biological specimens. One
of most intriguing aspect of this work is that MNP_Y only binds to
cancer cells after enzymatic dephosphorylation by the ectophosphatases.
We speculate that this enzyme activated binding (EAB) is either entropy
favorable or associates with the conformation dynamics of the unknown
protein complexes interacting with the MNP_Y, or possibly both. This
previously unexplored mechanism undoubtedly warrants further investigation,
which may lead to a new paradigm in multivalent binding. By mimicking
the essence of biological signaling processes (e.g., kinase/phosphatase
enzymatic switch20), the use of enzymatic
transformation to control the formation or state of nanostructures21 ultimately may lead to new approaches for detecting
and treating other diseases.
