We examined the concept of a novel
prodrug strategy in which anticancer
drug can be locally released by visible/near IR light, taking advantage
of the photodynamic process and photo-unclick chemistry. Our most
recently formulated prodrug of combretastatin A-4, Pc-(L-CA4)2, showed multifunctionality for fluorescence imaging, light-activated
drug release, and the combined effects of PDT and local chemotherapy.
In this formulation, L is a singlet oxygen cleavable linker. Here,
we advanced this multifunctional prodrug by adding a tumor-targeting
group, folic acid (FA). We designed and prepared four FA-conjugated
prodrugs 1–4 (CA4-L-Pc-PEGn-FA: n = 0, 2, 18, ∼45) and one non-FA-conjugated
prodrug 5 (CA4-L-Pc-PEG18-boc). Prodrugs 3 and 4 had a longer PEG spacer and showed higher
hydrophilicity, enhanced uptake to colon 26 cells via FR-mediated
mechanisms, and more specific localization to SC colon 26 tumors in
Balb/c mice than prodrugs 1 and 2. Prodrug 4 also showed higher and more specific uptake to tumors, resulting
in selective tumor damage and more effective antitumor efficacy than
non-FA-conjugated prodrug 5. FR-mediated targeting seemed
to be an effective strategy to spare normal tissues surrounding tumors
in the illuminated area during treatment with this prodrug.

Introduction
Chemotherapy is one
of the major tools to treat both localized
and metastasized cancers, and has been used for more than 50 years.
However, the problem of systemic side effects resulting from chemotherapy
is still unsolved. A more effective drug delivery system could minimize
the systemic side effects of anticancer drugs, particularly when such
a system meets two goals: tumor-specific delivery and tumor-specific
release of drugs from delivery systems.1−3 While many effective
targeting methods, such as liposome-, polymer-, and antibody-based
delivery systems have been incorporated into preclinical or clinical
use,4−14 more effective methods for controlling the site of drug release
have yet to be developed. Most stimuli that have been exploited to
release free drugs from the delivery systems are endogenous.1,15,16

Light has been recognized
as an excellent external stimulus for
spatiotemporal control of drug release from various drug delivery
forms, such as prodrugs, liposomes, polymers, and other nano- and
macro-delivery systems.17 The use of longer
visible and NIR light is desirable for treating bulk solid tumors
because these types of light can reach deeper tissues. However, there
is an unfilled gap between such low-energy light and its ability to
trigger the cleavage reactions of the chemical bond (linker) that
is often required to release the drugs. We proposed a novel drug activation/release
strategy, based on photodynamic processes and the unique chemistry
of singlet oxygen to spatiotemporally control the release of drugs
using visible or NIR light.18−29 This strategy takes advantage of spontaneous cleavage of dioxetanes
that were formed via the [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of the singlet
oxygen formed during photodynamic processes with electron-rich olefins.

Our previous work on the visible/NIR light-controlled site-specific
activation of prodrugs using a photodynamic process led to discovery
of the aminoacrylate bond as an ideal linker for singlet oxygen (SO)-cleavable
drug release.18,26 We call this method of drug release
“photo-unclick chemistry”. We unambiguously proved the
novel concept of visible/near IR light-controlled and SO-mediated
activation of prodrugs using both in vitro and in vivo models.19,20 Specifically, we demonstrated far-red light-activated, SO-mediated
drug release from two prodrugs of combretastatin A-4 (CA-4), CMP-L-CA4,
and Pc-(L-CA4)2 (Figure 1). Our
study showed combined effects from photodynamic damage and local chemotherapy,
and bystander effects from the released CA4 (Figure 2A). Because the lifetime of SO is short (submicrosecond scale),
SO as an effector of PDT itself cannot cause bystander effects during
the illumination. While bystander effect in PDT by the secondary oxidative
product like H2O2 has been observed,30,31 bystander effect in this manuscript focus on that caused by the
released chemotherapy drugs.

of CA4 [CMP-L-CA4
and Pc-(L-CA4)2] and their corresponding noncleavable prodrugs
[CMP-NCL-CA4 and Pc-(NCL-CA4)2].19,20

In the CA4 prodrugs, L is the
SO-labile linker and core-modified
porphyrin (CMP) and phthalocyanine (Pc) are photosensitizers. Pc-(L-CA4)2 could be optically imaged in mice due to the bright emission
from the fluorescent photosensitizer (fPS), Pc. These two prodrugs
showed significantly better antitumor effects than their corresponding
noncleavable prodrugs, CMP-NCL-CA4 and Pc-(NCL-CA4)2, in
which NCL refers to the noncleavable linker. These prodrugs were designed
to maximize the antitumor efficacy while minimizing the side effects.
Interestingly, the prodrug CMP-L-CA4 showed a significantly superior
antitumor effect as opposed to a simple combination of PDT (CMP-NCL-CA4)
and chemotherapy (CA4) without systemic side effects.19

Here, we advance our novel light activatable prodrug
strategy by
adding a tumor-targeting group to the prodrug system (Figure 2A). Optical imaging can also monitor the prodrugs
(Figure 2B). The dose of light required for
fluorescence imaging is much lower than what is needed for drug release;
therefore, we do not expect that imaging causes significant tumor
damage. We hypothesized that by using a tumor-specific delivery vector
such as folic acid (FA), we could selectively deliver the prodrugs
to folate receptor (FR)-overexpressing cancer cells and tumors, and
thus minimize the collateral damage to normal tissues after broader
illumination (Figure 2C). We present four targeted
prodrugs (1–4) and one nontargeted
prodrug (5), as a control. The four prodrugs were designed
with different spacer lengths (Figure 2B),
because we assumed that the length of the spacer is a major factor
for effective binding of FA-conjugate and FR. In this paper, we discuss
the design and synthesis of these prodrugs, in vitro cellular uptake
to FR-positive colon 26 cells, the impact of free folic acid on uptake,
in vitro phototoxicity, uptake to colon 26 tumors on mice, and specific
tumor damage from treatment with the selected prodrugs.

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis of Prodrugs
The general prodrug
structure of CA4-L-Pc-sp-FA was designed based on our previous nontargeted
fluorescent prodrug, Pc-(L-CA4)2, in which one of the CA4
units was used as a targeting group (Figure 2B and Figure 3). We chose folic acid (FA)
because the folate receptor (FR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked
membrane protein, is a well-known tumor-associated receptor that is
overexpressed in many tumors, including ovarian, lung, colon, and
breast cancers.9,32−34 FA35 or FA conjugates36 can also be taken up preferentially by cancer cells; thus, folate–drug
conjugates have been developed and tested in cultures, animal models,
and human clinical trials with successful results.9,37−44

Figure 3 Structures
of targeted prodrugs 1–4 and nontargeted
prodrug 5.

PEG was chosen as a spacer group because it is FDA-approved,
hydrophilic,
and biocompatible. PEG conjugation to our prodrugs would increase
solubility, thereby reducing the aggregation and nonspecific uptake
of the resulting conjugates by the cells or tumors, as well as increasing
the targeting capability.45−47 The prodrugs’ PEG length
was varied, because spacer length was one of the major factors for
FA-targeting efficiency.48−52 Prodrug 5 was designed as a nontargeted prodrug that
was similar to its targeted counterpart (3), but would
serve as a control to assess the contribution of FA to the FR-mediated
uptake.

Based on our previous reactions for Pc-(L-CA4)2, the
synthetic scheme was developed using reactions such as esterification,
yne-amine, nucleophilic substitution, click, and the amidation reaction,
to make the process easily adaptable to other alcohol-containing drugs
(Scheme 1). A nucleophilic substitution reaction
of a silicon phthalocyanine dichloride yielded compound 6. Intermediate 7 was synthesized through click (yne-amine)
reaction of compounds 6 and combretastatin A-4 propiolate
(CA4—CO—C≡C—H) at a 1 to 1 molar ratio
for the monofunctionalization. Prodrug 1 was synthesized
by the amidation of FA anhydride intermediate generated in situ and
compound 7. Compound 7 was esterified at
room temperature with 5-hexynoic acid to yield compound 8. Compound 13 was synthesized through multiple steps
(Scheme S1 in SI). A click reaction between
compounds 8 and 13 using PMDETA and CuBr
at 37 °C yielded prodrug 2. Compound 9 was synthesized by the amidation of compound 7 and
diglycolic anhydride at room temperature. Amidation of compound 9 with 17 (Scheme S2 in SI) or NH2-PEG∼45-FA (purchased from Nanocs,
Inc.) yielded prodrugs 3 and 4, respectively.
Monoprotection of diamine (compound 14, Scheme S2 in SI) using di-tert-butyldicarbonate
by refluxing under basic conditions gave compound 15.
Amidation and deprotection of 15 gave 17 (Scheme S2 in SI). Finally, prodrug 5 was synthesized by the amidation of compounds 9 and 15. All steps were straightforward, versatile,
and high yielding, with yields above 50%. We relied primarily on the
ESI method to determine the masses of our compounds containing aminoacrylate
linker, since the linker was highly sensitive to light.

Photophysical
Studies
Electronic absorption properties
of the prodrugs measured in DMF and partition coefficients between n-octanol and pH 7.4 buffer (log D 7.4) are listed
in Table 1. The UV–vis absorption spectra
of all prodrugs (Figure S1 in SI) showed
typical absorptions of silicon phthalocyanine with a sharp and intense
Q-band at 673–675 nm, which follows the Lambert–Beer
law (Figure S1 in SI), indicating that
the prodrugs remained nonaggregated in DMF. From the Q-band absorptions,
we could further deduce that there was no change in electronic absorption
properties of the conjugates by linking the silicon-(IV) phthalocyanine
core to the ligands, two bulky axial side-chains.53

The partition coefficients of the conjugates are
expressed as Log D7.4 values. Overall, prodrugs 1 and 2 without or with a shorter PEG spacer had higher
log D7.4 values than prodrugs 3 and 4 with longer PEG spacers. That is, prodrugs 1 and 2 were more lipophilic, while prodrugs 3 and 4 were more hydrophilic. It was evident that the
PEG length impacted the solubility of the prodrugs, at least among
these analogs. As expected from the structures, 5 had
higher log D7.4 (less hydrophilic) than 3 (0.65
vs −0.05), due to the more hydrophilic FA compared to lipophilic tert-butoxycarbonyl (boc) group.

Cellular Uptake to Cultured FR-Positive Colon
26 Cells
In order to establish structure-FR-mediated uptake
relationships,
the time-dependent uptake of prodrugs 1–5 was determined using FR-positive colon 26 cells.54 First, a clear relationship between partition
coefficient (log D7.4 value) and cellular uptake was observed;
that is, lower log D7.4 corresponded with higher uptake
(Figure 4A). Hydrophilic prodrugs 3 and 4 had much higher uptake throughout the observation
time period up to 24 h than the more lipophilic FA-conjugated prodrugs 1 and 2 (p &lt; 0.001). During
the experimental procedures, it was observed that hydrophilic prodrugs 3 and 4 aggregated less in culture media than
did hydrophobic prodrugs 1 and 2. In addition,
the FA group might facilitate the uptake of the prodrugs 3 and 4 via FR-mediated uptake mechanisms. Compared to
prodrug 5, the non-FA conjugated version of prodrug 3, prodrug 3 had significantly higher cellular
uptake over a period of 3–24 h (p &lt; 0.001).
These results support our hypothesis that FR facilitates higher uptake
of less aggregating, hydrophilic prodrugs 3 and 4.

Figure 4 (A) Time-dependent cellular uptake of prodrugs 1–5. Colon 26 cells were incubated with 10 μM prodrugs.
At various time points, the prodrugs in the cells were quantified
by fluorescence emitted from Pc of the prodrugs. (B) Impact of excess
free FA on the cellular uptake of the prodrugs. Cells were pretreated
(1 h) with 1 mM free FA before the addition of 10 μM of prodrugs 3, 4, and 5. The prodrugs in cells
were quantified in the same way as in (A). Data are means ± SD
(n = 3).

Impact of Excess Free FA in Culture Medium on the Cellular Uptake
of Prodrug
The dependence of uptake of prodrugs 3 and 4 on FR was further evaluated by performing a competitive
uptake assay in the presence of excess free FA (1 mM, 100-fold excess)
in the culture medium. The excess FA significantly reduced the uptake
of prodrugs 3 and 4 (p &lt;
0.001) at 24 h by 80% and 73%, respectively, while the cellular uptake
of non-FA conjugated prodrug 5 was not significantly
influenced (p &gt; 0.6, Figure 4B). These results suggest (1) that the main uptake pathway for prodrugs 3 and 4 into the FR+ cells was FR-mediated endocytosis,
consistent with the above uptake data and (2) that the uptake of non-FA
prodrug 5 was not mediated by FR.

Phototoxicity and Dark
Toxicity
To find the effects
of the cellular uptake on the prodrugs’ cell kill, we determined
the phototoxicity of these prodrugs (Figure 5). Briefly, colon 26 cells were incubated with the prodrugs at variable
concentrations for 7 h. Cells were then washed three times, and exposed
to laser light (690 nm) at 5.6 mW/cm2 for 30 min (10 J/cm2). Based on our previous study, such a condition of illumination
could be sufficient enough to cleave most of linkers in the prodrugs.21 Higher cellular uptake was associated with more
cell death (4 and 3 &gt; 2 and 1). FA-conjugated prodrug was more potent than non-FA conjugated
analogue (3 &gt; 5). IC50 values
were 1.65, 2.71, 4.03, 4.47, and 4.85 × 10–8 M for 4, 3, 2, 1, and 5, respectively. From the phototoxicity results,
we concluded that increasing the PEG length not only increases the
solubility (hydrophilicity) of the prodrug, but also increases both
uptake and cell death. All conjugates were noncytotoxic (&gt;70% cell
survival) in the dark at &lt;2 μM (Figure S3 in SI).

Figure 5 Phototoxicity of prodrugs 1–5 against
colon 26 cells. Cells were incubated with the prodrugs for 7 h, washed
3 times with PBS, and then illuminated with 690 nm at 5.6 mW/cm2 for 30 min (10 J/cm2). Cell viability was determined
with MTT assay 72 h after the illumination, and expressed as mean
percentage ± SD (n = 3) with respect to untreated
control cells. (N.B. SD is not presented here.)

In Vivo Optical Imaging
After in vitro cellular uptake
experiments, we continued with the preclinical optical imaging study.
Because these prodrugs have the same fluorescence photosensitizer,
Pc, we expected that all prodrugs could be imaged using a preclinical
optical imaging system (IVIS imaging system), and that FR-mediated
uptake in tumors could be readily visualized. Each prodrug (2 μmol/kg
in 200 μL) was injected IV into Balb/c mice bearing SC colon
26 tumors on the lower back neck region (3 mice/group). Figure 6A shows images of the mice at various time points
postinjection.

Interestingly, the mice injected with prodrug 4 showed specific intense emission spots around tumors (Figure 6A, iv) at 7 h. The mice injected with prodrug 1 did not display such bright tumor spots, but showed the
overall minimal emission from the entire back. Images from mice injected
with prodrugs 2 and 3 showed moderate emission.
Consistent with the in vitro uptake results, there was a relationship
between the length of the PEG spacer and tumor localization. Prodrugs
with longer PEG spacers were taken up more in tumors, presumably via
FR-mediated uptake. It seemed that the lipophilic prodrug 1 was not distributed to the skin or tumors, or the emission of two
prodrugs was minimal, possibly due to aggregation observed during
the experimental procedures. The mice injected with non-FA-conjugated
prodrug 5 showed a somewhat distinct image pattern: bright
but broader spots around tumors, higher emission throughout the entire
back, and two bright spots that were presumed to be the kidneys. The
distribution of prodrug 5 seemed to be higher, but less
specific to tumors, than the distribution of prodrug 4, suggesting that the localization of 5 might not be
primarily mediated by FR.

To estimate the concentrations of
the prodrugs in tumors and skin,
average emission intensities were calculated from these images (Figure 6A,B). The ratios of tumor to skin (Figure 6C) were plotted. As shown, prodrug 4 demonstrated higher (27 023 A.U.) and more selective tumor
uptake (tumor/skin ratio = 3:1) at 7 h than did the other prodrugs.
Prodrug 1 showed lower emission (∼10 559
A.U.). Prodrugs 2 and 3 showed some localization
to tumors (tumor/skin ratios = 2:1 and 2:1). Prodrug 5 showed the highest uptake in both tumor (32 175 A.U.) and
skin (22 585 A.U.), compared with the other prodrugs, but uptake
was not selective (tumor/skin ratio = 1.4:1).

fluorescence images of prodrugs 1–5. Images of Balb/c mice (n = 2 for prodrugs 1, 2, 5; n = 3
for prodrugs 3, 4) bearing
SC colon 26 tumors were taken before drug administration and at 0.25,
1, 3, 7, 9, 24, 48, and 72 h post IV injection of the prodrugs (2
μmol/kg). Images were scaled to the same maximum (30 000
A.U.) and minimum values (11 000 A.U.). (B) Average photon

photon emission from selected skin area of mice IV injected with prodrugs.

represented here.)

Tissue Distribution of
Prodrugs 4 and 5
Because the preclinical
imaging data show prodrug distribution
more accurately in superficial areas such as tumor surface and skin,
a conventional biodistribution study was performed to understand the
tissue distribution of two prodrugs, 4 (the best FA-conjugated
prodrug) and 5 (non-FA-conjugated, control prodrug),
in detail. Various tissue samples were collected 7 h after IV administration
of these prodrugs (3 mice per group). Collected tissue samples (150
mg) were dissolved in 1 mL DMSO, homogenized, and then centrifuged.
Fluorescence of the supernatant was read (emission at 605 nm and absorption
640–750 nm).

Consistent with the preclinical optical
imaging data, the fluorescence emission of tumors (232 A.U.) from
the mice injected with prodrug 4 was significantly higher
than emission from skin (85 A.U.) and muscle (39 A.U., p &lt; 0.01, Figure 7A). The ratios of tumor/muscle
and tumor/skin were 6:1 and 3:1 (Figure 7B).
Fluorescence emission of skin (166 A.U.) from the mice injected with
prodrug 5 was higher than that (85 A.U.) from the mice
injected with prodrug 4 (p &lt; 0.01).
However, low emission of tumors (47 A.U.) was observed from mice treated
with prodrug 5, which contrasts with the preclinical
optical imaging data showing high emission from broad tumor areas
(Figure 6A). We assume that the higher emission
of tumor areas of the mice injected with 5 could be due
to the higher concentration of 5 in skin on the tops
of the tumors. This finding reminds us that the preclinical
optical imaging data should be assessed with care and with the help
of complementary methods. Non-FA-conjugated prodrug 5 did not show such selective uptake in tumors: the ratios
of tumor/muscle and tumor/skin were 1:1 and 1:3. Overall, the tissue
distribution study confirmed the higher uptake of FA-conjugated prodrug 4 in tumors over other skin and muscle, probably due to FR-mediated
uptake in tumors.

to fluorescence emission of tissues. (C) Fluorescence emission from

(100×). Data are averages and SD of samples from three mice.

To see the impact of excess of
free FA in mice to the uptake of
prodrugs 4 and 5, tissue uptake of prodrugs 4 and 5 was determined after pre-IP-injected
excess of FA (100×) (Figure 7C). We expected
a significant decrease of prodrug 4 uptake in FR-positive
tissues (e.g., FR-positive colon 26 tumor and FR-rich kidney) because
free FA could interfere with the FR-mediated uptake. Indeed, the free
FA reduced the tumor uptake of prodrug 4 (72%) as well
as the FR-rich kidney uptake (31%). On the other hand, the free FA
had a minor impact on the tumor and kidney uptake of non-FA-conjugated
prodrug 5, with 14% and 5% increase in tumor and kidney
uptake, respectively. These results strongly support our analysis
that FR-mediated uptake has a major role in the uptake of FA-conjugated
prodrug 4 into FR-positive colon 26 tumor.

Selective and
Effective Tumor Damage by Treatment with Prodrug 4
Enhanced delivery of FA-conjugated prodrug 4 to FR-positive
colon 26 tumors led us to evaluate selective
damage to tumors over skin damage in the illuminated areas. Balb/c
mice (3 mice per group) with SC colon 26 tumors were treated with
prodrugs 4 and 5 (as a positive comparison).
When tumors reached 4–6 mm diameter, the mice were IV injected
with 2 μmol/kg of prodrug 4 or 5 in
200 μL 5% Cremophor EL in PBS. Then, 7 h post-injection, we
illuminated a 12 mm area centered on the tumor with a 690 nm laser
(100 mW/cm2 for 30 min, 180 J/cm2; Figure 8A). The treatment conditions were based on our previous
studies.20 The mice were imaged and volumes
of tumors were measured.

Figure 8 (A) Photographic images of mice (3 mice per
group) treated with
prodrug (none, 4, or 5 at 2 μmol/kg)
with illumination (690 nm laser, 12 mm diameter circular beam, 100
mW/cm2, 30 min) 7 h post IV administration of the prodrug:
(i) day 0 before illumination, (ii) day 1, (iii) day 6, and (iv) day
15 post-illumination. (B) Kaplan–Meier plot of response to
treatment.

There was an apparent difference
between mice treated with prodrug 4 and mice treated
with prodrug 5, in terms of
the damage to the illuminated area (Figure 8A). Damage to the surrounding skin in the illuminated area was less
in mice treated with prodrug 4 (days 1 and 6), due to
the higher tumor/skin ratio. In mice treated with prodrug 5, the surrounding skin showed more severe damage and slower healing
(day 15), possibly due to the higher concentration of 5 in the skin (tumor/skin ratio = 1:3).

In the antitumor efficacy
study (Figure 8B), all three mice treated with
prodrug 4 were tumor-free
until day 75. The tumors seemed to be removed. Two of three mice treated
with prodrug 5 had large tumors (&gt;800 mm3)
on days 19 and 23. The outstanding antitumor effect of 4 should be due to the high concentration of the prodrug 4 in tumor. The FA-targeting was effective not only for selective
delivery to tumors, sparing the skin in the illuminated area, but
also for enhanced delivery to tumors, improving the antitumor efficacy.
No significant body weight loss was observed in any group (Figure
S2 in SI), indicating no acute toxicity
during the treatment period.

Conclusions
Targeted
multifunctional prodrugs were designed to achieve selective
and enhanced delivery of SO-cleavable prodrugs to tumors. The prodrugs
express the combined effects of PDT and local chemotherapy. Nontargeted
prodrug 5 and FA-conjugated prodrugs 1–4, with varying lengths of a PEG spacer, were prepared via
straightforward and versatile synthetic routes. From the above studies,
we draw the following conclusions.

The length of the PEG spacer
made a significant impact on the partition
coefficients (log D7.4) between n-octanol
and pH 7.4 buffer of these prodrugs. Prodrugs 3 and 4 had longer PEG units and lower log D7.4 than
did prodrugs 1 and 2 with shorter PEG spacers.
Cellular uptake of prodrug 3 and 4 to cultured
FR-positive colon 26 cells was also significantly higher than that
of prodrugs 1, 2, and 5. The
enhanced uptake of prodrugs 3 and 4 seemed
to be mediated by FR. The enhanced uptake also resulted in higher
cell kill. Prodrugs 3 and 4 showed more
specific delivery to tumors compared with prodrugs 1, 2, and 5. Prodrug 4 had the longest
PEG spacer and was the best at delivering drug to tumors. Compared
with non-FA-targeted prodrug 5, prodrug 4 showed higher and more selective uptake to tumors, presumably due
to FR-mediated uptake. This resulted in selective and effective tumor
damage, sparing the skin in the illuminated area. In clinical settings,
a broad area around a tumor must be illuminated in order to have a
margin for complete ablation of tumor. Therefore, sparing the normal
tissues surrounding tumors is crucial, especially when the tumors
reside in critical organs. We proved that FA-targeting of SO-cleavable
prodrug could be effective in achieving that goal.

We envision
that this targeted prodrug concept can be adoptable
to many other applications because the prodrug system is simple but
highly flexible. All three components, PS, Drug, and targeting groups
can be easily substituted with others as needed for specific disease
types. Quantitative understanding of both cellular and pharmacological
mechanisms of prodrugs, in particular, with temporal and spatial resolution,
will provide an opportunity for achieving more in synergistic effects
of PDT and site-specific chemotherapy. Tunability of two therapeutic
effects (PDT vs drug effects) will also provide new opportunities
beyond the oncological applications. These are the basis of our current
studies.

Experimental Procedures
Materials and Methods
All commercially
available chemicals
were of analytical grade and were used without further purification.
Solvents and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific.
PEG-diamine (compound 14, Scheme S1 in SI) was purchased from Polypure AS, Gaustadaleen 21, N-0349.
Oslo, Norway (Cat #: 12112–1892, MW = 897), while H2N-PEG∼45-FA was obtained from Nanocs Technology,
Inc. (Cat #: PG2-AMFA-2k, MW = ∼2000). Analytical thin layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum-backed 5–17
μm silica gel plates with fluorescent indicators from Sigma-Aldrich
(Cat #Z193291–1PAK). All chromatography was performed using
32–63 μm silica gel from Sorbent Technologies (Cat #02826–26).
Preparative TLC was performed on glass-backed plates precoated with
silica with UV254 prep-scored 20 × 20 μm from Analtech
Inc. (Catalog #02003). All dialysis was performed using 7 Spectra/Por
dialysis membrane (MWCO: 1000 Da) from Spectrum Laboratories, Inc.
Gel filtration chromatography were performed using either Sephadex
LH-20 (Cat #17–0090–10) or Sephadex G-15 obtained from
GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB. Deuterated solvents (NMR solvents with
residual solvent signals as internal standards) were purchased from
Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories or Sigma-Aldrich. NMR spectra were
recorded at 25 °C with a 300 MHz spectrometer (Varian Mercury).
Representative NMR spectra are found in SI. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were collected using an Agilent
6538 UHD Accurate Mass QTOF (Santa Clara, CA) equipped with an electrospray
ionization source at the Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University
of Oklahoma. Low-resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were acquired using
Ion Trap Bruker Daltonics HCT Ultra PTM Discovery system with ESI
source at the CORE Facility of OUHSC. Representative MS spectra are
found in the SI.

Purity was evaluated
by analytical HPLC using a waters HPLC system (waters-501 solvent
delivery system, SPD-10AV shimadzu UV–vis detector, a U6K-03696
autoinjector), coupled to a chromatography data system N2000. HPLC
chromatograms of prodrugs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are found in SI.
HPLC chromatogram of prodrug 4 could not be made because
it was not a single compound. Thus, we used 1H NMR spectra
to determine its identity and purity (SI Figures
S30–32). Mobile phase was pumped at a flow rate of 0.6
mL/min. A μBondapak C18 (5 μM) column (250
× 4.6 mm I.D. 12109949TS) was used; this was preceded by a guard
column containing C18/Corasil Bondpak (particle size 37–50
μM). Detection was effected at 254 and 350 nm, and an isocratic
condition was used.

The optical images of live mice (Figure 6A and SI Figure S37)
were obtained using
the IVIS spectrum (PerkinElmer, Inc.) with Live Image software. Weighing
of compounds and acquisition of in vivo images were done under minimal
light conditions. Female Balb/c mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories, Inc. through NCI (Frederick, MD). Mice were housed and
handled in the animal facility of the College of Pharmacy or Rodent
Barrier Facility in the Biomedical Research Center-West at the University
of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma City, OK. All
animal experiments were approved by IACUC, OUHSC. This mouse tumor
model (colon 26 cells on Balb/c mice) was chosen, not because we want
to demonstrate the efficacy of the prodrugs to colon tumor, but because
this tumor model has FR, has an intact immune system, and has been
commonly used in PDT studies.

Compounds 10 and 14 were purchased. Compounds CA4 propiolate,196 (Scheme 1),2011 (Scheme S1 in SI),5512 (Scheme S1 in SI),55 and 13 (Scheme S1)56 were
prepared based on methods in the previous reports.

Compound 7
Compound 6 (0.38
g, 0.47 mmol) was added to a 150 mL dry THF solution in a round-bottom
flask. The solution was purged and maintained for 10 min in N2 atmosphere. CA4 propiolate (0.17 g, 0.47 mmol) dissolved
in 30 mL dry THF was then added dropwise into a vigorously stirred
solution of 6 over 1.5 h, and then allowed to stir for
an additional 15 min. The reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced
pressure and the crude product was purified using either the preparative
TLC or a short column chromatography first, using the solvent system
ethyl acetate/methanol (4:1 v/v) to remove the disubstituted product,
followed by DCM/MeOH/NH4OH (79:17:4 v/v/v) to afford the
target compound 7 as a blue solid (320 mg, 58%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD2Cl2-d2): 9.67 (br s, m, 8H), 8.38 (br s, 8H), 7.19 (d, J = 11.9 Hz, 1H), 7.00 (m, 2H), 6.85 (d, J = 11.9 Hz, 1H), 6.52 (s, 2H), 6.46 (m, 2H), 4.35 (d, J = 12.99 Hz, 1H) 3.76 (s, 3H, OMe), 3.70 (s, 3H, OMe), 3.65 (s, 6H,

Compound 8
5-Hexynoic acid (0.019 g, 0.17
mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (56.6 μL,
0.044 g, 0.34 mmol), and O-(benzotriazol-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate (HBTU, 0.065 g, 0.17 mmol) were added to a 5 mL
dry DCM stirring solution of compound 7 (0.10 g, 0.085
mmol). The reaction mixture was left for 2 h at room temperature and
monitored using TLC. At the end of the reaction, the reaction mixture
was diluted with 60 mL of DCM and washed with 200 mL water three times.
The organic filtrate was then dried using anhydrous sodium sulfate
(Na2SO4) and evaporated to dryness in vacuo.
The crude was redissolved in minimum DCM, and then recrystallized
using a mixture of cold hexane/Et2O. The solid residue
was washed several times with diethyl ether to afford a deep blue
solid product (87 mg, 81%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD2Cl2-d2): 9.67 (br s, m, 8H),

Compound 9
Compound 7 (0.084
g, 0.072 mmol) and diglycolic anhydride (0.0084 g, 0.072 mmol) were
added to 6 mL anhydrous DMF in 10 mL round-bottom flask equipped with
a magnetic stir bar at room temperature, and allowed it to run for
36 h. The reaction mixture was poured dropwise into cold diethyl ether
(Et2O). The blue precipitate was filtered using a sintered
glass funnel. This was further washed with more diethyl ether solvent
to obtain a blue solid (64 mg, 69%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD2Cl2): 9.67 (br s, m, 8H), 8.38 (br s, 8H), 7.19

Compound 15 (Scheme S2 in SI)
A stirring solution of a commercially
available diamine
(compound 14; 500 mg, 0.56 mmol) in anhydrous MeOH (9.31
mL) was treated with Boc2O (123 mg, 0.56 mmol) and triethylamine
(TEA) (178 μL, 1.67 mmol).57 The
reaction mixture was left to reflux for 24 h. The solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and the resulting yellow oil was purified by
silica gel chromatography using DCM/MeOH/NH4OH (79:17:4%
v/v/v) as the eluent to give 15 as a colorless/white
solid after freezing (400 mg, 72%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O-d2): 3.64 (br s, −CH2– of PEG), 3.20 (m, 4H), 3.00 (m, 4H), 1.43 (s, 9H, t-butyl group). LRMS (ESI): calcd for C45H93N2O21 [M + H]+: 997.63,
found: m/z 997.70.

Compound 16 (Scheme S2 in SI)
To
a stirring solution of FA (0.083 g, 0.19 mmol) in anhydrous
DMF/pyridine (5:1 v/v) solution, DCC (0.23 g, 1.13 mmol) was added
in one portion.57 The reaction mixture
was kept in an ultrasound bath in the dark for 30 min. Then, the resulting
suspension was quickly filtered over a sintered funnel and the precipitate
was washed with a minimum amount of DMF/pyridine solution. Boc-PEG
amine (15; 180 mg, 0.19 mmol) was then added to the filtrate
and allowed to stir in the dark for 36 h. The reaction mixture was
then poured dropwise into a stirred solution of cold Et2O/acetone (4:1 v/v) to afford a yellow precipitate that was collected
on a sintered glass funnel. After washing several times with cold
acetone and Et2O, the material was dried to give a deep
yellow solid product. This was further purified by passing over Sephadex
G-15, using deionized water as a solvent to remove any unreacted folic
acid (196 mg, 73%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O-d2): 8.60 (s, 1H), 7.52 (br s, 2H), 6.62 (br
s, 2H), 3.52 (br s, −CH2– of PEG block),

C64H110N9O26 [M + H]+: 1420.76, found: m/z 1420.70.

Boc-deprotection on compound 16 was accomplished using
TFA at room temperature. The deprotected product (17)
was used for the next step without further purification, after drying
under high vacuum.57

Prodrug 1
Prodrug 1 was synthesized
from FA following a modified procedure from the literature.57 To a stirring solution of FA (0.015 g, 0.034
mmol) in anhydrous DMF/pyridine (5:1 v/v) solution, DCC (0.043 g,
0.21 mmol) was added in one portion (Figure S1 in SI). The reaction mixture was kept in an ultrasound bath in
the dark for 30 min. Then, the resulting suspension was quickly filtered
over a sintered funnel and the precipitate was washed with minimum
amount of DMF/pyridine solution. A solution of 7 (0.040
g, 0.034 mmol) was added into the filtrate. The resulting mixture
was further stirred at room temperature in the dark for 24 h. The
crude reaction mixture was then purified by passing through a gel
permeation G-15 Sephadex column, using DMF as the eluent to separate
the product from the unreacted folic acid starting material. The top
stop was then collected and poured dropwise into a stirred solution
of cold Et2O/acetone (4:1 v/v) to afford a green precipitate
that was collected over a sintered glass funnel. An alternative method
was simply to precipitate it in cold Et2O/acetone (4:1
v/v), followed by dialysis in DMF with cellulose membrane of MWCO
of 1000 Da for 48 h. After washing several times with cold acetone
and Et2O, the material was dried to give a deep blue solid
product (34 mg, 62%) with more than 96% purity (Figure S22 in SI). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): 9.67 (br s, 8H), 8.65 (s, 1H), 8.49 (m,

Prodrug 2
Compounds 13 (0.020
g, 0.033 mmol) and 8 (0.042 g, 0.033 mmol) were dissolved
in 1.5 mL anhydrous DMF. After purging with nitrogen gas at room temperature, N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (PMDETA; 0.0058 g, 0.033 mmol)
and CuBr (0.0048g, 0.033 mmol) were added and the solution was stirred
at 37 °C for 48 h. Opening it to air stopped the reaction. The
mixture was then diluted with DMF. It was washed with water to eliminate
copper. The crude was extensively dialyzed against DMSO for 72 h (cutoff
MW 1000) and then precipitated using cold Et2O/acetone
mixture (4:1 v/v) to afford 2 as green precipitate (37
mg, 60%). HPLC chromatogram indicated a purity of more than 97% (Figure

Prodrug 4
Commercially available NH2–PEG∼45–FA (compound 10; 0.078 g, 0.033 mmol), compound 9 (0.044 g,
0.034 mmol), DIPEA (0.099 mmol), and HBTU (0.019 g, 0.050 mmol) were
added to a 4 mL anhydrous DMF in a 10 mL round-bottom flask equipped
with a magnetic stir bar and allowed it to stir for 3 h at room temperature.
The crude reaction mixture was passed through a G-15 Sephadex column
using DMF as the eluent. With the molecular weight of the final product
greater than 1500 g/mol, the products passed through the void volume
and were collected as the fast moving spot from the solvent front.
The product was dialyzed (MWCO of 1000 Da) for 48 h against DMF and,
subsequently, against DCM for 12 h to eliminate the DMF. The product
in DCM was concentrated in vacuo and precipitated into a sticky dark
green solid product using cold Et2O (71 mg, ∼58%; SI Figure S31 for stacked 1H NMR of
NH2–PEG∼45–FA and 4). 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6): 9.67 (m, 8H), 8.40 (m, 8H), 7.96 (br s, NH), 7.69 (m, 1H),

Log D7.4
n-Octanol/pH 7.4
buffer partition coefficients of all five conjugates were determined
by “shake flask” direct measurement.58 Saturated solutions of conjugates were prepared by adding
10 μL of 4 mM DMSO stock solutions to a mixture of equal volumes
of 1 mL n-octanol and a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer.
The saturated solutions were vigorously shaken for 30 min using a
shaker, and then were allowed to settle for 4 h. Then, 100 μL
of each layer was diluted to 1 mL with DMF and the absorbance of the
prodrug conjugates in the respective solutions were determined. The
partition coefficients were obtained by calculating the ratio of the
absorbance of the conjugates in the two layers and the results reported
as Log D7.4 value. Experiments were performed in triplicate.

General Conditions for Colon 26 Cell Culture
Mouse
colon adenocarcinoma (colon 26) cells,54 which are FR-positive, were used for all biological experiments.
All reagents and culture media were obtained from Invitrogen and Sigma-Aldrich.
The cells were grown in low glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM, 4.0 g/L glucose) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum, 1% antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 μg/mL
streptomycin), and 2 mM l-glutamine. The cells were maintained
continuously in culture media and subcultured biweekly to maintain
approximately 80–90% confluence. A BioTek plate reader (Synergy
2) was used to read UV/vis absorbance. A Molecular Device fluorescence
plate reader (Gemini EM) was used to read the fluorescence. The incubation
was at 37 °C under humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 using a Sanyo MCO-18AIC-UV incubator. Colon 26 cells were seeded
at (2–5) × 104 cells/well in 200 μL media
in 96-well microplates for 24 h before the experiment, to allow cell
attachment.

Cellular Uptake to Cultured Colon 26 Cells
To determine
the intracellular accumulations of all prodrugs (1–5), colon 26 cells54 were seeded
in 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well in 200 μL
complete medium and were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The 4 mM stock solutions of the conjugates in DMSO were
diluted to 100 μM with a Cremophor formulation mixture composed
of PBS/EtOH/Cremophor (18:1:1 v/v/v), before solutions were added
to the wells. The respective diluted solutions were then added to
complete medium in each well to achieve a 10 μM final concentration
of conjugate per well, and the well plates were incubated at various
time points. After every incubation time point, the medium was removed
and the cell monolayer was rinsed thrice with cold PBS. We then added
100 μL of DMSO to each
well to solubilize the cells for 5 min, after which an additional
100 μL of absolute EtOH was added. The fluorescence from phthalocyanine
(Pc) was read using the multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices,
SpectraMax M2 model) set at 605 nm excitation and 640–800 nm
emission wavelengths. The intracellular accumulation of the conjugates
was expressed in fluorescence units (A.U.).

Dark and Phototoxicity
The cytotoxicity of all five
conjugates was determined in colon 26 cells with and without illumination.54 Briefly, cells were grown in tissue culture
flasks (75 cm2) and maintained under 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37 °C. DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum, 1%
(v/v) l-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin
G and 100 μg/mL streptomycin) was used as the growth medium
and changed on alternate days. The cells were harvested with a 0.25%
w/c trypsin-EDTA solution, once 90% confluence was achieved. Cells
were subcultured in 190 μL of the complete medium in 96-well
culture plates at a density of (1.0–1.5) × 104 cells/well, followed by incubation for 24 h. 10 μL of the
respective diluted solutions of the conjugates (previously diluted
from the 4 mM stock solution to the appropriate concentrations using
complete media) were then added to the complete medium in each well
to achieve final concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to10 μM.
The plates were then incubated for 7 h.

Phototoxicity Study
The medium in each well was removed
and cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (190
μL) to remove any unbound fluorescence. 190 μL of fresh
medium was then added to each well and illuminated the uncovered plate
for 30 min using a diode laser (690 nm, 5.6 mW/cm2) while
gently shaking using an orbital shaker (Lab-line, Barnstead International).
The plates were incubated for a further 3 days at 37 °C in 5%
CO2, after which cell viability was determined by MTT.
Briefly, a volume of 10 μL of MTT at a concentration of 10 mg/mL
was added to 190 μL of complete media in each well. After 4
h of incubation, MTT solutions were removed and formazan crystals
formed were dissolved in 200 μL of DMSO while shaking for 10
min. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm with background subtraction
at 650 nm. The cell viability (%) was then quantified by measuring
the absorbance of the treated wells, compared with that of the untreated
wells (controls). The controls in the assays involved tests done with
cells not incubated with the conjugate prodrugs. The experiments were
performed in triplicate. IC50 was calculated with GraphPad
Prism 5.59,60

Dark Toxicity
Study
Cell plating was performed in a
fashion similar to the phototoxicity study, but without illumination.
Briefly, the media in each well was removed, rinsed three times with
cold PBS, and replaced with fresh medium. The plates were kept in
the dark for 30 min and then returned to the incubator. After an additional
72 h incubation, cell viability was determined using the MTT assay
described above.

Impact of Excess Free FA in Culture Medium
on the Cellular Uptake
of Prodrug
In order to demonstrate that FA and FA-conjugates
compete for the same receptors, 5 × 104 colon 26 cells
in 96-well plates were preincubated with 1 mM FA (100-fold excess
of free FA).54 After 1 h, 10 μM of
prodrugs 3, 4, or 5 was added.
At the end of each incubation period, fluorescence emission was taken
as indicated in the uptake experiment. Briefly, colon 26 cells were
incubated in 96-well plates at a cell density of 5 × 104 cells per well in complete medium for 24 h. 5 mM FA was prepared
by first dissolving an appropriate amount of the compound in 1 mL
DMSO at 60 °C, and later diluting it in PBS to make a total volume
of 10 mL. 26.6 μL of this solution was then added to 133 μL
of complete medium in the well plate to achieve a 1 mM free FA. This
was incubated for 1 h before the addition of 40 μL of prodrug
in complete media solution. At various time points, the fluorescence
of wells with free FA was measured, following the same protocol as
the uptake experiment. The results were compared with wells without
free FA at the same time points. The results are expressed as fluorescence
units within a given volume of solvent.

In Vivo Optical Imaging
Three 4-to-6-week-old female
Balb/c mice (∼20–22 g, Charles Rivers Laboratories,
Inc.) were used to monitor the distribution and tumor targeting ability
of the five prodrugs. The mice were implanted subcutaneously with
2 × 106 colon 26 cells in PBS (100 μL) on the
lower back neck. Tumor growth was monitored with digital calipers
for 14 days, until the tumors reached 4–6 mm in diameter. The
mice were then anesthetized in an acrylic chamber with a 2.5% isoflurane/air
mixture followed by retro-orbital injection with 2 μmol/kg of
the prodrugs in 5% Cremophor solutions (PBS/EtOH/Cremophor, 18:1:1
v/v/v) . Images were taken using the IVIS imaging system (Caliper
Life Sciences), which consisted of a cryogenically cooled imaging
system coupled to the data acquisition computer running Living Image
software. Fluorescence images were taken at 0, 0.25, 1, 3, 7, 9, 24,
48, and 72 h postinjection. During the imaging process, the following
parameters were used: fluorescence mode, exposure time 0.5 s, binning:
medium, F/Stop: 2, excitation: 675 filter (660–690 nm), and
emission: 720 filter (710–730 nm). The mice were anesthetized
before imaging. During post processing, image counts were adjusted
to 11 000 A.U. as minimum and 30 000 A.U. as maximum
color scale.

Tissue Distribution
Tumor-bearing
mice (20–23
g) were randomly divided into two groups (n = 3 mice
per group). Four μmol/kg of prodrug 4 or 5 in 5% Cremophor formulation (200 μL) were administered
via retro-orbital injection into each animal. [For the study with
the excess FA, FA (200 μmol/kg) in 0.2 mL saline was IP-injected
to mice 1.5 h before the prodrug injection.] At 7 h post injection,
all mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and exsanguinated
by opening the thoracic cavity. Blood samples were withdrawn from
the heart through a syringe and immediately centrifuged at 1200 rpm
for 10 min to collect the plasma. Tissues were excised from major
organs (lungs, heart, kidneys, muscle, liver, skin, spleen), rinsed
with PBS, and blotted dry with absorbent tissue. 150 mg of excised
tissues in 1 mL DMSO was homogenized for 2 min. The homogenates were
centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were
then pipetted into three wells of a 96-well plate.150 mg of blood
plasma was weighed out, diluted with 1 mL DMSO, and treated like the
other tissues. The fluorescence was read using a microplate reader
with excitation wavelengths at 605 nm and emission wavelengths of
640–800 nm. The uptake to the tissues was reported as the mean
fluorescence unit and standard deviation. The 7 h time point was selected
based on the in vivo life imaging data, when prodrug 4 has a maximum tumor/skin ratio.

Treatment of Mice with
SC Colon 26 Tumors
All animals
were 4 to 6 weeks old at the time of injection. A total of 2 ×
106 colon 26 cells in 100 μL PBS were implanted subcutaneously
on the lower back of the neck. Tumor volumes were monitored with digital
calipers and calculated as an ellipsoid volume using the formula (π/2)lw2, where l = longest axis
of tumor and w = shortest axis perpendicular to l.
Mice with tumors 4–6 mm in diameter were used for the experiment.
4 mM DMSO stock solutions of prodrug 4 or 5 were diluted to achieve final a concentration of 2 μmol/kg
with 5% Cremophor formulation. 200 μL of the sample via retro-orbital
injection was administered once on day 0. Seven hours after injection,
the mice were anaesthetized via ketamine 80 mg/kg and xylazine 6 mg/kg
injected IP. The tumor area was then illuminated for 30 min with a
690 nm diode laser at 100 mW/cm2 (180 J/cm2).
Tumor size was measured every 2 days. Three groups (n = 3 mice per group) were tested: (1) control (without conjugates
or irradiation), (2) 2 μmol/kg prodrug 4 + hv, and (3) 2 μmol/kg prodrug 5 + hv.
