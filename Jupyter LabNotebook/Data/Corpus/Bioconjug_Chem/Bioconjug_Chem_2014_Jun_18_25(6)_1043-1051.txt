Tagging biologically
active
compounds of interest with a fluorescent tracer can allow for visualization
of the spatial and temporal perturbation of biological systems in
their endogenous state. Organic fluorophores are central for enabling
imaging of dynamic biological systems at the single molecule to whole
organism level.− For advanced optical microscopy techniques, small molecule dyes
are orthogonal and often superior to alternatives, such as fluorescent
proteins, due to their small size and ease of synthetic access. The
identification of organic fluorophores suitable for labeling tool
compounds of interest without perturbing biomolecular activity is
an important but frequently problematic step in probe development.
For live cell and in vivo imaging, an appropriate
balance of aqueous solubility and lipophilicity is critical to ensure
membrane permeability while minimizing nonspecific staining of lipid
membranes. Recent efforts to develop fluorescent
dyes that satisfy the rigorous conditions required for routine live
cell imaging have involved the development of nonplanar cyanine fluorophores,
which exhibit low levels of nonspecific staining in preliminary cell
studies. Novel Near-IR probes have also
been tested for routine live-cell imaging studies and point toward
the importance of fluorophore development with explicit consideration
of the eventual challenges to be faced in the imaging environment
of interest.

The ideal reporter
group is a chemically stable, small fluorophore
that readily trafficks through cellular compartments, maintains photostability
in oxygenated aqueous media, and exhibits few drug-like attributes,
which could interfere with a measurement of interest. The fluorescent tag should have high quantitative brightness,
photophysical properties that are independent of the local environment,
good aqueous solubility (while remaining small and uncharged), and
a favorable logP. Some of the most widely employed fluorophores for
bioimaging are difluoro-boron-dipyrromethene dyes (BODIPYs) (1) (Figure ). BODIPY dyes fulfill most requirements for routine imaging and conjugation
to small-molecule and protein targets of interest.

Structures of BODIPY
dyes.

However, the traditional BODIPY
core is inherently lipophilic and
poorly water-soluble. These physical attributes drive partitioning
of the fluorophore (or tagged small molecule) into lipophilic compartments,
resulting in nonspecific staining of membranes and intracellular organelles.
The typical background staining, which we attribute to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes (see below), is commonly observed
with cell permeable BODIPY dyes and other lipophilic dye classes (for
examples, see refs (−)). This characteristic can be troublesome as it significantly
nonspecifically biases cellular distribution of labeled small molecules
to membranes, which is often confused for specific target binding.

To counteract the main drawback of poor aqueous solubility, efforts
to improve BODIPY dyes have strived to improve water solubility via
the addition of charged functional groups such as sulfonates (2) and phosphonates (3), including the symmetric
functionalization of the boron-core. Ligands
with a net formal charge of zero have also been explored such as zwitterionic
sulfobetaines (4). While
all approaches yield BODIPY dyes with improved water solubility, the
applicability of these derivatives for live cell and in vivo imaging is limited by the ionic character of the solubilizing groups,
which impair membrane permeability, and often result in a significantly
increased size of the fluorescent tag. Similarly, modification with
multiple PEG-groups (5) can improve aqueous solubility,
again at the cost of increased size (in some examples the solubilizing
groups account for &gt;80% of the total molecular weight). Of interest in this context are dialkoxy (6) and diacetoxy (7) BODIPY dyes that have been
reported to exhibit improved aqueous solubility compared to the difluoro
analogues.− However, no reports studying the application of such
probes in biological systems have been published.

In this work,
the aim was to develop a method to improve the biological
imaging compatibility of the BODIPY fluorophore while ideally retaining
opportunities for multimodal imaging and bioconjugate chemistries.
The presented approach originates from our group’s recent development
of BODIPYs for hybrid optical/positron emission tomography imaging. Instead of 19F/18F exchange,
we explore selective access to singly alkoxy-substituted (core monoalkoxy)
BODIPY (CMA-BODIPY) dyes and evaluate the applicability of these derivatives
for biological imaging in comparison to BODIPY and dialkoxy-BODIPY
dyes.

We found that retaining one fluorine on the dye scaffold
allows
for exquisite tuning of the physiochemical properties of the fluorophore
while providing an attachment site for bioconjugate and multimodal
imaging chemistries. Most importantly, CMA-BODIPYs are characterized
by excellent membrane permeability, homogeneous distribution, and
low nonspecific background in living cells. Prior to our work, following
published procedures, CMA-BODIPYs (8) were only obtained
as byproducts in mixtures with the corresponding dialkoxy derivatives
(6) that are difficult to separate., Herein, we report efficient methodology to selectively access singly
alkoxy-substituted BODIPYs and evaluate their applicability for live
cell imaging in comparison to BODIPY and dialkoxy-BODIPY dyes.

Results
Synthetic
Approach
Methodology
We selected BODIPY (9) as
a model substrate since it is well established and provides direct
access to dimethoxy BODIPY (10) as a reference compound
(Figure a).,, To selectively substitute only one fluorine, we applied
a two-step one-pot strategy, inspired by our previous work on 19F/18F exchange on BODIPYs for hybrid optical/positron
emission tomography imaging. The synthesis
relies on abstraction of a single fluoride from the BF2-core to generate a borenium intermediate (11)., We found this intermediate readily reacts with suitable alcohols
to yield the desired monoalkoxy-BODIPY (12) in high yields
without the formation of dialkoxy BODIPY (Figure b).

is given in parentheses. (c) Synthesis of MayaFluor 14 and (d) tetrazine-functionalized MayaFluor 15. HaloTag-ligand
conjugated BODIPY 16 and MayaFluor 17.

Specifically, CMA-BODIPYs were
accessed by activation of difluoro-BODIPY
with excess trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf) to yield
the BODIPY-OTf (11) intermediate, followed by addition of a suitable alcohol to afford the
desired monoalkoxy-BODIPY in moderate to good yields (12a–e). The activated BODIPY-OTf (11) is not stable for a prolonged time under the reaction conditions
and slowly degrades, forming the free pyrrole ligand. Therefore, the
addition of the desired alcohol ligand has to be timed carefully.
Simultaneous addition of DIPEA as a mild, non-nucleophilic base to
buffer the acidity of the crude reaction solution was found to be
beneficial.

This synthesis is highly modular and allows for
easy access to
an array of different alkoxy BODIPY derivatives. Notably, the presented
methodology is compatible with primary alcohol, primary amine, NHS-ester,
and tetrazine functional groups. We therefore predict that this strategy
will tolerate a wider number of functionalities. For example, as illustrated
in Figure c, the NHS-functionalized BODIPY 13 was efficiently converted into the glycol-analogue 14. We expect that these functionalities would be synthetically
incompatible with the existing strategies (referenced above) to access
these analogues as mono and dialkoxy mixtures of compounds such as 12b.

Of particular interest is the direct functionalization
with tetrazines
as illustrated by BODIPY 15 (Figure d), which was isolated in 24% yield. Tetrazines have recently
received much appreciation for their applications in bio-orthogonal
catalyst-free “click-reactions” with trans-cyclooctenes or cyclopropenes, respectively.− A unique feature
of tetrazines is their ability to quench green to red emitting fluorescent
dyes by a FRET based mechanism. Reaction
of 15 with trans-cyclooctene (TCO) in
PBS results in greater than 30-fold fluorescence increase (). Probes like 15 will therefore be useful tools to visualize TCO or cyclopropene-labeled
biological targets in live cells.

Physicochemical Characterization
of CMA-BODIPYs
To
assess the suitability of CMA-BODIPY dyes for biological applications,
we investigated their physical properties in direct comparison to
relevant reference compounds, difluoro 9 and dimethoxy 10 BODIPY in aqueous buffer at physiological pH.

Solubility
We first investigated the solubility characteristics
in aqueous buffer at physiological pH. Dry powders of the respective
compounds in excess were used to prepare saturated solutions in PBS
(pH = 7.4). The alkoxy derivatives have excellent water solubility,
while the difluoro-BODIPY 9 appears to be virtually insoluble in PBS. Quantitative
measurements showed that the alkoxy derivatives are generally soluble
at medium to high micromolar concentrations in PBS without the requirement
of co-solvents or detergents (Table ).

Lipophilicity
Next, we determined the logD7.4, which is an important
characteristic to gauge membrane permeability
and the propensity of a small molecule to distribute between aqueous
and hydrophobic cellular compartments. Compounds with a logD of 1–3
strike this balance best and demonstrate the greatest membrane permeability. The increased aqueous solubility of CMA-BODIPYs
correlates with a lower logD7.4 compared to difluoro BODIPY 9 (Table ). Notably, the methoxy (12a) and glycol analogues (12b,c) exhibit ideal logDs of 1.4 and 2.2, respectively. The CMA-BODIPY 12d, as a result of the protonated amine group, is slightly
more hydrophilic (logD = 0.32). In contrast, the difluoro-BODIPY 9 had an unfavorable logD of &gt;5.

Aqueous Stability
To further probe the persistence
of the chemical integrity of the dyes and identify fluorescent degradation
products that would not result in reduction of overall fluorescence
(Figure ) we also monitored the stability
of representative BODIPY derivatives over 24 h in PBS by LC-MS. The
stability data obtained at room temperature and 37 °C () demonstrate that the monoalkoxy
analogues exhibit good to very good stability. In contrast, the dimethoxy
reference compound 10 was characterized by increased
hydrolysis and underwent near-quantitative degradation after 24 h
incubation at 37 °C. This data stands in sharp relief to the
monomethoxy derivative 12a that experienced only modest
degradation under these conditions. Importantly, monoalkoxy derivatives
with incrementally larger substituents were characterized by improved
stability displaying only minor or no hydrolysis. Detailed LC-MS analysis
revealed that both difluoro 9 and fluoro-alkoxy 12 BODIPY hydrolyze to form the common 4-fluoro-4-hydroxy
BODIPY as the primary degradation product, while the formation of
4-methoxy-4-hydroxy BODIPY was observed for compound 10.

Optical Properties
The absorbance and emission spectra
of CMA-BODIPYs 12a–e measured in
aqueous solution were virtually identical to the corresponding absorbance/emission
profile of 9, which was measured in DMSO because of limited
aqueous solubility (Table  and ). The quantum yield (QY) and therefore
the brightness of fluorescent dyes can be strongly dependent on the
polarity of the environment, and some dye classes have been shown
to be poorly fluorescent in aqueous media. Due to poor overall aqueous solubility, reference data for BODIPY
dyes is generally limited to solvents such as methanol or halogenated
hydrocarbons. However, the QY in aqueous environments is a more relevant
metric for biological applications. We therefore determined QYs of
CMA-BODIPYs in water (Table ). All tested
compounds that were sufficiently soluble exhibited good quantum yields
of 0.3–0.5, which is comparable to the results reported under
the same conditions for BODIPY dyes containing the aforementioned
solubilizing sulfobetaines 4 and the widely used cyanine
dyes. The QY of difluoro-BODIPY 9 is nearly quantitative in MeOH; however, fluorescence is
almost completely suppressed in water, possibly as a result of self-quenching
due to aggregation.

In addition to solvent polarity, pH can
also impact the spectral properties of organic fluorophores like fluorescein
and hydroxycoumarin. While this characteristic can be exploited for
the development of pH-sensors, it is not a desirable photophysical
characteristic for fluorescent labeling and tracking small molecules
or proteins. As CMA-BODIPYs do not feature
functional groups that are ionizable under physiologically relevant
pH values, the fluorescence intensity is expected to be pH independent
as observed with regular BODIPYs. Using
CMA-BODIPY 12a as representative example, we did not
observe a significant change in fluorescence intensity over a broad
pH range (pH = 3–10) (see ).

To demonstrate that the favorable properties of CMA-BODIPYs
are
retained upon conjugation to small molecules, we synthesized HaloTag
functionalized BODIPY 16 and CMA-BODIPY 17 from the common NHS-ester precursor 13 (Figure e). HaloTag ligands bind selectively and covalently
to HaloTag, a small protein that can be expressed as a fusion protein
with a target protein of interest, to allow for selective labeling
of intracellular targets. We selected
the HaloTag system over other tags like SNAP-tag and CLIP-tag as it
would represent a demanding test system; the chloroalkane HaloTag
ligand is very hydrophobic. The solubility of compound 17 in PBS was 231 μM, almost 2 orders of magnitude greater than
the BODIPY 16 (Table ). Similarly,
this increased aqueous solubility also translated into an improved
logD.

In Vitro Profiling
Live Cell
Imaging
To evaluate the applicability of
CMA-BODIPYs for live cell imaging, we interrogated representative
derivatives for their ability to penetrate mammalian cell membranes
and their propensity for nonspecific background staining. MD-MBA-231
cells expressing mCherry-histone H2B were incubated with 10 μM
of 12a, 12b, and 9, respectively.
Following a 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the culture medium was
replaced every 5 min to remove excess dye. Live cells were imaged
by multichannel fluorescence microscopy to assess penetration efficiency
and subcellular staining patterns and estimate wash-out kinetics (Figure , ). All
tested compounds exhibited efficient cell uptake. However, cellular
uptake kinetics significantly differ for CMA-BODIPYs 12a–c compared to BODIPY 9. Quantitative
intracellular studies demonstrated that even at short incubation periods
(5 min) and low concentrations (100 nM) 12a–c rapidly enter cells to a high degree and washed out efficiently,
which is consistent with the favorable logD of these compounds. In
contrast, the highly lipophilic parent compound, BODIPY 9, showed minimal cellular uptake after short incubation ().

Cellular uptake and intracellular distribution
and wash-out kinetics
of MayaFluors 12a and 12b in comparison
to difluoro BODIPY 9. MD-MBA 231 cells (expressing mCherry
labeled histone H2B) were treated for 30 min at 10 μM followed
by media replacement every 5 min to remove excess dye. Both CMA-BODIPYs
show relatively homogeneous even intracellular distribution compared
to BODIPY 9, which seems to primarily locate to endosomal
structures. 12a and 12b are efficiently
washed out within 10 min in contrast to 9, which is retained.
Each image was acquired from an independent replicate well, to ensure
no confounding photobleaching effects. (High resolution images are
provided in .) All images were
acquired with identical microscopy settings and have not been processed
differently to allow for direct comparison. All images are to scale.

Importantly, BODIPY 9 displayed a subcellular perinuclear
reticulate staining pattern that is consistent with nonspecific binding
to the ER and Golgi, reminiscent of other reports employing hydrophobic
BODIPY dyes for live-cell imaging (Figure c).− We have validated this experimentally via costaining experiments
with BODIPY 9 and ER-Tracker Red, demonstrating a high
degree of colocalization ().
In contrast, CMA-BODIPYs showed little to no nonspecific staining
and are distributed throughout the cells (Figure a,b). Both CMA-BODIPYs are efficiently washed out by replacement
of dye-free media, in sharp contrast to compound 9, which
is retained. Similar results were obtained after longer wash cycles.

To assess potential cytotoxic effects of CMA-BODIPYs, we incubated
MCF-7 cells with 10 μM 9, 12a, and 12b, respectively. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo.
Even after prolonged incubation for 48 h none of the tested dyes reduced
cell viability (). Having established
the favorable membrane permeability and low nonspecific background
staining of CMA-BODIPYs, we expect that these and related MayaFluors
will have far reaching applications for rapid and specific imaging
of elusive biological targets in living cells.

Discussion
The BODIPY dyes are an exciting fluorophore class for diverse imaging
applications. They are particularly promising for tagging bioactive
compounds for intracellular live cell imaging. However, poor aqueous
solubility and high lipophilicity significantly limit the scope of
BODIPYs for chemogenomic studies. Although extensive efforts have
focused on developing derivatives that have improved water solubility
by either installing charged substituents or large PEG chains, these
modifications also severely impair or abolish cell permeability.

In this work we report the development of methodology to selectively
substitute one of the two canonical fluorides common to most BODIPY
dyes with alkoxy ligands, and show that the resulting dyes are highly
soluble and cell permeable.

This new class of BODIPY fluorophores,
which we term MayaFluors,
has significantly improved physicochemical properties that are ideally
suited for biological applications. MayaFluors retain the optical
attributes of the parent BODIPY dye class while enjoying significant
improvements in their lipophilicity. Importantly, we demonstrate the
robust optical and chemical stability of these probes under cell culture
imaging conditions. We have validated the applicability of these dyes
as fluorescent reporters for live cell imaging and demonstrate that
MayaFluors have excellent membrane permeability and show little to
no nonspecific staining. Furthermore, we did not observe a differential
propensity of MayaFluors to photobleach compared to conventional difluoro
BODIPY derivatives. Additionally, MayaFluors did not impact the viability
of living cells, even after prolonged incubation at concentrations
much higher than would be required for imaging applications.

We hypothesize that the low propensity of MayaFluors to insert
into biological membranes is the result of aqueous solubility imparted
by the increased out of plane dipole moment these analogues experience
as opposed to difluoro BODIPYs. Furthermore, addition of the alkoxy
substituent disrupts the planarity of the BODIPY core, which is expected
to reduce their ability to self-aggregate and insert into lipid leaflets
via the formation of π–π stacks. One interesting feature of MayaFluors for future study
is the tetrahedral coordination environment of the boron core and
the potential to access chiral MayaFluors from the corresponding asymmetrically
substituted homochiral BODIPY precursor. These derivatives would represent
interesting materials for nonlinear imaging of chiral environments
and second harmonic generation imaging at interfaces.

Our synthetic methodology is the first approach to
selectively
access MayaFluors and is compatible with a broad array of functional
groups commonly utilized in chemogenomic approaches. The method allows
for direct modification of the well-established BODIPY dyes and provides
easy access to diversely functionalized reporters. Importantly, the
alkoxy substituent presents an additional and unique attachment site,
which can be readily deployed as modular tether for multiple conjugation
chemistries without perturbing the fluorophore scaffold. Notably,
we foresee applicability for the installment of click-tags and isotope
bearing ligands for dual modality imaging (e.g., PET and MRI)., The broad impact of our approach is demonstrated herein by reaction
of 13C-methanol with BODIPY 11 to yield 13C-labeled 12a ([13C]-12a), a direct
MRI probe and surrogate compound for 11C-PET imaging. Alternatively,
small molecules of interest that feature an appropriate hydroxyl group
may be directly functionalized by reaction with the BODIPY-OTf intermediate.

Fluorescent Turn-on Reaction
Kinetics
15 μL tetrazine-functionalized
CMA-BODIPY 15 (20 μM) and 15 μL 4-trans-cyclooctenol (40 μM) stock solutions in PBS
were combined in black, flat-bottom 384-well plates. Time-dependent
fluorescence intensity increase was measured in TECAN Safire 2 multiwell
plate reader (λex = 490 nm, λem =
512 nm). All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Physical
Characterization
Stability Tests on Plate-Reader
Stability tests were
performed on a monochromator based TECAN Safire 2 multiwell plate
reader. From 10 mM DMSO stock solutions, 10 μM dilutions of
the title BODIPY derivatives and Fluorescein were prepared in 1X PBS
(pH = 7.4) and cell imaging media [RPMI 1640 (+) 10% FBS and (−)
phenol red]. 30 μL of replicates were transferred into black,
flat-bottom 384-well plates. Fixed fluorescence intensity readings
were acquired over 30 h under constant instrument settings. Excitation
and emission wavelengths selected for monitoring were optimized for
BODIPY analogues (λex = 490 nm, λem = 512 nm). In between reads, plates were stored at room temperature
and protected from light. Note that 9 and 12e were analyzed in 1:1 1X PBS:DMF.

Stability Tests on Analytical
LC-MS
From 10 mM DMSO
stock solutions, 10 μM dilutions of the title BODIPY derivatives
were prepared in 1X PBS (pH = 7.4). Replicates were stored, protected
from light, either at room temperature or in a sterile incubator (37
°C, 5% CO2). Over 24 h, neat aliquots were taken from
these solutions at standardized time points and analyzed by analytical
LC-MS. The multiwavelength fluorescence detector settings were optimized
for monitoring BODIPY fluorescence (λex = 490 nm,
λem = 512 nm). Instrument gain and EUFS settings
were maintained as constant values across runs during the time-course
experiment.

Solubility Test
Solubility tests
were performed on
a monochromator based TECAN Safire 2 multiwell plate reader. Stock
solutions for solubility tests were prepared by dissolving each compound
(in quantities at least 2 mg and greater) in 1X PBS until fully saturated.
Upon reaching saturation, solutions were centrifuged at 15 000
rpm for 10 min to ensure that no free particles were suspended in
the supernatant. Aliquots from the saturated solution were removed
and dissolved into DMSO (10-fold dilution). 30 μL aliquots of
replicates were transferred into black, flat-bottom 384-well plates
and fixed fluorescence intensity readings were acquired. The multiwavelength
fluorescence detector settings were optimized for monitoring BODIPY
fluorescence (λex = 490 nm, λem =
512 nm). These values were referenced to concentration calibration
curves (nM to mM) of each compound dissolved in DMSO acquired under
identical instrument settings.

LogD Test
LogD
tests were performed on a monochromator
based TECAN Safire 2 multiwell plate reader. Prior to performing the
experiment, a 1:1 mixture of 1-octanol (spectrophotometric grade)
and 1X PBS were equilibrated for 24 h at room temperature. This equilibrated
1-octanol was used as the nonpolar cosolvent for logD measurements.
To perform LogD, aliquots of the saturated 1X PBS stocks, described
in the solubility test, were added to an equivalent volume of 1-octanol.
The biphasic solutions were continuously and vigorously shaken for
1 h. Solutions were centrifuged for 2 min at 15 000 rpm to
assist in layer separation and then aliquots (in triplicate) were
removed from each layer and subsequently dissolved in DMSO (10-fold
dilution). 30 μL aliquots of replicates were transferred into
black, flat-bottom 384-well plates and fixed fluorescence intensity
readings were acquired. The multiwavelength fluorescence detector
settings were optimized for monitoring BODIPY fluorescence (λex = 490 nm, λem = 512 nm). Each set of measurements
(sat. 1X PBS layer in DMSO and octanol layer in DMSO) per compound
was obtained under identical instrument settings.

pH Fluorescence
Test
pH-dependent fluorescence of CMA-BODIPY 12a was measured using a monochromator based TECAN Safire
2 multiwell plate reader. Briefly, 10 mM stock solution of 12a in DMSO were diluted into aqueous buffer (pH = 3, 5, 7.4, 10) at
100 μM, and transferred into black, flat-bottom 384-well plates
(CORNING) and fluorescence intensity was acquired (λex = 490 nm, λem = 512 nm) in duplicate.

Cell Culture
Cell lines were propagated following sterile
technique using sterile incubators (37 °C, 5% CO2).
Cell culture media and supplements were sterile filtered prior to
use and were obtained from Gibco (FBS, 1X Attachment Factor), Life
Technologies (CO2 Independent Medium, RPMI 1640, 1X PBS),
and Invitrogen (RPMI 1640). Chemical reagents were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technologies (Staurosporine), Promega (CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay), and Life Technologies (ER-Tracker Red). Culture
and imaging plates were obtained from MatTek Corporation (No. 1.5
glass-bottom), COSTAR (Cat #9309), Lab-Tek (PA 19440), and MatriPlate
(MGB096-1-2-LG-L).

MDA-MB-231 (pLVX H2B-mCherry) cells were
a gift of Dr. Sarah Earley. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with RPMI
1640 1X [(+) phenol red, (+) 10% FBS, (+) 1% Pen-Strep]. PtK2 cells
were cultured in 24 well No. 1.5 glass-bottom dishes with MEM [(+)
2% FBS + 1% Pen-Strep]. MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (American
Tissue Culture Collection) and cultured in 1X RPMI 1640 [(+) phenol
red, (+) 10% FBS, (+) 1% Pen-Strep]. Prior to experiments, cells were
confirmed mycoplasma free using a commercially available testing kit
from Lonza (MycoAlert). Imaging data was analyzed with ImageJ software
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij).

Cell Viability Studies
20 000 MCF-7 cells/well
were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. The next day, cells were
incubated with varying concentrations of MayaFluors. Pentamethyl difluoro
BODIPY and staurosporine were selected as positive controls, for 24
and 48 h incubation, respectively. Assay compounds were dispensed
from 10 mM DMSO stock solutions using an HP D300 digital dispenser.
Following incubation, cells were washed with 1X PBS and the cytotoxicity
was evaluated using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, plates
were taken out from incubator and equilibrated to room temperature
for 30 min and a volume of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to each
well in a 1:1 ratio with the culture medium present in the assay wells.
After 10 min incubation at room temperature to stabilize luminescent
signal, the plates were read in a Luminescent Plate Reader (Envision,
PerkinElmer 2103 Multi Reader). Control wells containing medium without
cells were prepared to obtain background luminescence data. All assays
were performed in duplicate.

Live Cell Imaging
Imaging of
Wash-Out Kinetics
Live-cell imaging was
performed on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 M inverted epifluorescence microscope
with a 40X objective. Per region of interest, a bright field view
was acquired as well as GFP and TexasRed fluorescence channels. Two
days prior to imaging, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at 20 000
cells/well on a 96-well glass bottom microwell plate pretreated with
1X Attachment Factor. Imaging media was used for experiments, RPMI
1640 1X [(−) phenol red, (+) 10% FBS]. The day of imaging,
each well was incubated for 30 min with 10 μM of the title compound
suspended in cell imaging media (final DMSO content = 0.1%). Subsequently
three washes were performed. Each wash consisted of removing spent
media, adding fresh imaging media, and incubating the cells for 5
min. After each wash a thin layer of cell imaging media was added
and wells were rapidly imaged. No imaging enhancing processing was
performed for acquired data.

For confocal imaging of BODIPY
and ER-tracker colocalization, images were acquired on a Leica TSC
SP laser scanning spectral confocal microscope at 70X magnification
(20X objective, 3.5 hardware zoom) as z-stacks with
1 μm step size. 40 000 MCF-7 cells/well were seeded in
a 4 Chamber Glass Slide from Lab-Tek with 1 mL RPMI 1640 imaging medium
supplemented with FBS. The next day, media was aspirated, cells were
washed with 1X PBS, and 500 μL warm RPMI medium containing a
final concentration of 10 μM difluoro-BODIPY and 1 μM
ER-Tracker Red was added to the chambers and incubated for 1 h at
37 °C. Cells were washed once with PBS and covered with 500 μL
PBS for immediate live-cell imaging. Maximum z-projection
images were exported as tiffs and no further image enhancing processing
was performed.

BODIPY Uptake Quantification
Images
were acquired on
a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope system with a humidified chamber from
InVivo Scientific to maintain a 37 °C environment. The microscope
was equipped with a Mercury arc lamp, a PlanApo 60XA (NA = 1.4, Ph3
DM) oil objective, a Chroma FITC filter cube, and cooled charge-coupled
device camera (CoolSNAP HQ, Roper Scientific). The microscopy system
was controlled by Nikon Elements software. PtK2 cells were cultured
in 24-well plates with CO2 Independent Medium. For drug
treatment and wash-out, each compound was added to live cells for
a final concentration of 100 nM. The fluorescent images were immediately
collected upon drug treatment. Then, wells were washed once with 1
mL fresh media and replaced with another 1 mL fresh media. After 5
min, the washout images were collected using 200 ms exposure time
with 2-by-2 binning. Individual cells were selected by same size ROI
(region of interest) for calculation of average intensity. A total
of 29 cells (compound 9), 23 cells (compound 12a), 29 cells (compound 12b), and 24 cells (compound 12c) were used.
