Introduction
Smoking is the leading
cause of preventable death and illness worldwide,
with over 5 million tobacco-related deaths reported annually. Unassisted attempts to quit smoking have a poor
success rate, and although current medications (including nicotine
replacement, nicotine receptor agonists, antidepressants, and counseling)
increase short-term cessation, improved therapies to increase long-term
abstinence are required. A therapeutic
strategy currently in clinical development is vaccination against
nicotine, where anti-nicotine antibodies are generated that can sequester
the stimulant, preventing it from binding to nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors in the brain. In theory, this approach would negate the
positive feedback requisite for addiction and relapse. However, vaccines
against nicotine have so far shown limited efficacy as antibody responses
have proven highly variable, and only the small percentage of individuals
who sustained high anti-nicotine antibody titers remained abstinent
over the long term., These findings do however validate
the approach, and development of a vaccine that gives consistently
high titers in a non-population-specific manner should provide significant
improvement to long-term smoking cessation success rates.

Small
molecules cannot themselves elicit an immune response, and
need to be covalently attached to a protein or peptide to enable recognition
by the immune system. The carrier serves
two purposes: first, it presents multiple copies of the small molecule
hapten to B cells, which are then activated upon cross-linking of
their B cell receptors (BCRs). Second, in order for the immune response
to be specific, fervent, and long-lasting, isotype switching from
IgM to IgG needs to be promoted by coactivation of T cells. However,
T cell activation can only occur through presentation of peptidic fragments on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of an antigen
presenting cell. It has also been observed that increasing the copies
of hapten conjugated to the carrier protein surface (hapten density)
is generally correlated with an increase in immune response strength
and specificity, although it should be
noted that excessive BCR cross-linking has been observed to result
in B cell anergy.

We posited that
through the use of hapten clustering the immune
response would be enhanced by facilitating an increase in the maximum
potential (effective) hapten density on the protein carrier, creating
a higher avidity interaction with the B cell and in theory promoting
increased cross-linking of the BCRs through the colocalization of
multiple hapten copies. Although the optimal spatial distribution
of the hapten is still unknown, it has been demonstrated that a hapten
spacing of 5–10 nm with a hapten density of at least 10–20
per carrier resulted in robust B cell activation, an achievable goal for a small molecule hapten display.

Hapten clustering has been extensively investigated in the field
of carbohydrate vaccines, where this approach is thought to enhance
the immune response by mimicking the natural spatial arrangement of
carbohydrates on cancer cells, while also promoting more efficient
B cell receptor cross-linking., Existing methods to
achieve hapten clustering primarily consist of hapten display on linear,
cyclic, and dendrimeric peptidic scaffolds (e.g., RAFTs, and MAPs). This approach is well-suited
to carbohydrate vaccines where antibody production to the entire cluster
may be an advantage, but this is not the case for small molecules,
and the only example of application to drugs of abuse was a divalent
attachment to a linear peptide, where the monovalent counterpart was
more effective. As an alternative approach
to increase the hapten density within the drugs of abuse vaccine arena,
we envisaged the use of a small molecular scaffold containing a core
that would allow diverging three-dimensional projection of the hapten
copies to promote spatial separation.

With this in mind, we
wished to pursue a comparative study to investigate
the use of different hapten display methods, wherein the absolute
efficacy should not alter the findings and any results should be translatable
to other haptens engaged in vaccines against drugs of abuse. For this
purpose, we selected our readily accessible 3′-substituted
nicotine-hapten, AM1, 1;− this hapten-linker regiochemical
display has been used in the majority of nicotine vaccines that have
progressed furthest through clinical trials, with both NicVAX3 (Cytos Biotechnology) and NicQβ4 (Nabi Pharmaceuticals)
using 3′ conjugates of nicotine (Figure ). However, 3′-AmNic has subsequently been shown to elicit
antibodies with poorer nicotine affinities than other hapten-linker
presentations. In addition, we switched
our choice of carrier protein from keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)
to ovalbumin (OVA), which although less immunogenic, has the benefit of allowing direct measurement of hapten incorporation
by MALDI-TOF MS, as hapten density was a fundamental variable in our
comparative study.

NicVAX and
NicQβ.

To summarize, we envisaged
that the sequence of events that would
culminate in an unique multihaptenic display could be enabled through
the use of a synthetic scaffold that was immunogenically silent, and
would allow for effective three-dimensional projection of the hapten
cluster to achieve recognition of the monomer while simultaneously
effecting cross-linking of the BCRs. Adamantane has been used as a
scaffold core for numerous applications, and is also a component of small molecule drugs for a wide range
of indications. Trifunctionalization
of its C4 symmetric scaffold with the hapten at three vertices, leaving
the fourth available for attachment to the carrier protein, would
result in the display of a trihaptenic cluster, simultaneously tripling
the potential hapten density. While the scaffold allows rigid three-dimensional
projection of the cluster, well-chosen linkers introduce flexibility;
this combination should facilitate recognition of individual monomeric
units. Finally, late-stage introduction of the hapten allows for a
divergent, yet modular, approach toward optimization of the system.

Results
and Discussion
We began by synthesizing the required nicotine–hapten
scaffold
appendages thus: alcohol 2 was prepared according to
the literature in 2 steps from cotinine, and then this was transformed into AM1 (1) as previously
reported, in high overall yield (Scheme ). The corresponding AM1-NH24 was synthesized in an analogous manner from alcohol 2 by reaction with 5-bromovaleronitrile and reduction of the intermediate
nitrile 3 in moderate yield. The required decoration
of the adamantane scaffold could be achieved on gram scale following
previous methods,− and the introduction of a 5-carbon linker gave triacid 6. Subsequent coupling with AM1-NH24 and
ester hydrolysis gave triAM1 (7) in good yield.

Synthesis
of AM1 (1) and triAM1 (7)
Next, AM1 and triAM1 were activated with sulfo-NHS
and conjugated
to OVA. Conjugation efficiency of triAM1 (2.75 ≡ 8.24 copies
of nicotine–hapten) was significantly lower than AM1 (11.4
copies), as determined by MALDI-TOF, likely a result of the use of
a comparatively smaller molar excess, as well as a possible cumulative
negative impact of the conjugation of this large molecule on successive
reactions of surface lysines. Nevertheless, these conjugates were
formulated with SAS and the efficacies of the vaccines determined
by vaccination of BALB/c mice (n = 6). The obtained
plasma antibody titers were determined by ELISA (Figure ). Titers for bleeds at days 42 and 56 from mice vaccinated
with AM1-OVA were significantly higher than those vaccinated with
triAM1-OVA, with no increasing immune response apparent for the latter
conjugate throughout the study.

Midpoint antibody titers from AM1-OVA
and triAM1-OVA vaccinated
mice (n = 5–6) as determined by ELISA using
AM1-BSA as the coating antigen. Data were obtained in duplicate. Numbers
in parentheses represent the hapten density; error bars represent
standard error of the mean (SEM); individual points represent individual
mouse titers.

To further evaluate this
scaffold strategy, RIA was used to gauge
the immune response. While the traditional mindset has been to use
ELISA as the metric to judge hapten–antibody immune response,
this methodology grossly misrepresents the true immune response to
small molecule antigens since the affinity and avidity of the antibodies
to a solid-supported hapten-protein conjugate is not representative
of the interaction with the soluble hapten. Initial experiments to determine plasma antibody concentrations
that could bind the l-(−)-[N-methyl-3H]-nicotine tracer supported the significantly poorer immune
response elicited by the triAM1 hapten; plasma taken from triAM1-OVA
vaccinated mice at day 56 could only bind ca. 12% tracer at the highest
achievable concentration, compared with ca. 44% binding for half this
concentration of plasma elicited by AM1-OVA. Therefore, further analysis
was not attempted.

The poor immunogenicity of triAM1 as a hapten
could partially be
attributed to the lower hapten density on the carrier protein compared
with AM1, although this was thought unlikely to account for the entire
disparity. The lower immunogenicity of this trivalent hapten is comparable
to a finding in a recent study by Sanderson, where a peptidic, monovalent
vaccine against methamphetamine showed a greater immune response than
the corresponding divalent vaccine, with two identical haptens appended
to both amines of the N-terminal lysine residue. Further analysis of the mouse plasma showed
that antibodies raised against triAM1-OVA had a substantially increased
response to triAM1-BSA coated ELISA plates (Figure S1, ), suggesting that recognition
of the monomer is not being achieved; hence, the display may be too
“dense” to allow for antibody production to a single
copy of AM1, resulting in the production of antibodies that have poor
affinity for nicotine. Additionally, this compact display may not
allow simultaneous binding to multiple BCRs, preventing the cluster
from efficiently effecting B cell stimulation. However, there was
significant variability in antibody titers within both groups of mice,
and two of the mice vaccinated with triAM1-OVA produced antibodies
with titers as high as 15 000 at 56 d (Figure 2, ), suggesting that it is
possible for this drug–hapten scaffold to elicit a moderate
immune response in a subset of the population.

Having established
a lower limit benchmark of our adamantane hapten
cluster, it was hoped that optimization of the hapten’s linker
would result in more effective recognition of the monomer as well
as increased BCR cross-linking and thus an enhanced immune response
in a higher percentage of mice. As a second generation candidate,
we chose to introduce a short polyglycine spacer between the hapten
and the scaffold, as this has previously been used in vaccination
against oxycodone, where it was found to enhance the immunogenicity
of the hapten, giving higher titers than a similar vaccine without
the tetraglycine unit (although it must be noted that there was simultaneous
alteration of the hapten itself, which may have effected some or all
of the higher immune response). The new
target, triAM1(Gly)2 (10), thus contained
all the elements of triAM1 (7), with the addition of
diglycine spacers between the adamantane scaffold and the three hapten
copies (Scheme ). Synthesis was achieved by
the introduction of the diglycine unit onto AM1-NH2, 4; Boc-deprotection of carbamate 8 followed by
coupling to the scaffold and subsequent ester hydrolysis gave the
target in good yield. In an attempt to delineate modification of the
hapten from the cluster effect, we also investigated incorporation
of the diglycine unit into the monovalent hapten. Therefore, the same
linker as appended to the scaffold for conjugation to the protein
was coupled to diamide 9 to afford AM1(Gly)2 (11) in moderate yield. Again, conjugation to OVA of
the trivalent scaffold, in this case triAM1(Gly)2, gave
a far lower conjugation efficiency (1.98 ≡ 5.93 copies of nicotine
hapten) than AM1(Gly)2 (5.79 copies) with both achieving
a lower (effective) hapten density than AM1 (10.6 copies).

Synthesis
of triAM1(Gly)2 (10) and AM1(Gly)2 (11)
Following immunization of mice using the OVA-conjugates,
AM1-OVA
was found to elicit similar titers to the conjugate from the first
round of vaccinations as well as a similar pattern of variation between
the mice within the group, as expected given that both conjugates
had similar hapten densities (study 1: 11.4 copies, titer of 33 518;
study 2: 10.6 copies, titer of 54 755). Although quantitative
comparison of these titers would be inappropriate given that they
were performed separately, the qualitative similarity in the titers
obtained served to validate the reproducibility of this vaccination
protocol.

Within the new study, comparable titers for all three
conjugates
was observed, which was exciting given the lower hapten densities
of both of triAM1(Gly)2 and AM1(Gly)2 compared
to AM1 (Figure ). Furthermore, the variability
of titers within the triAM1(Gly)2-OVA group was much lower
than was seen for the monovalent hapten groups, with none of the mice
in this group exhibiting poor anti-nicotine titers.

In order
to determine the antibody specificity for the monovalent
hapten over the trivalent hapten, ELISAs were also carried out using
both triAM1(Gly)2-BSA and AM1(Gly)2-BSA as the
coating antigens (Figure S2, ). TriAM1-OVA had previously demonstrated enhanced recognition of
the trivalent hapten over the monovalent hapten (Figure S1, ). However, this effect
was significantly reduced for triAM1(Gly)2, which gave
an improved selectivity profile toward the monovalent hapten. This
suggests that we were correct in our hypothesis that the introduction
of the peptidic linker favored the recognition of the monomeric hapten.
Unsurprisingly, no significant difference was observed between titers
of any group with AM1-BSA and AM1(Gly)2-BSA as the coating
antigens. On the basis of these promising results, we would suggest
that nicotine–hapten clustering could provide a path forward
to obtain more consistent immune responses across the population,
something that has been strongly lacking in previous nicotine vaccines.,

and AM1(Gly)2-OVA vaccinated mice (n =
5–6) as determined by ELISA using AM1-BSA as the coating antigen.
Data were obtained in duplicate. Numbers in parentheses represent
the hapten density, error bars represent SEM, individual points represent
individual mouse titers.

RIA analysis supported the efficacy of the multihaptenic
display;
triAM1(Gly)2-OVA elicited very similar antibody affinity
and concentration (155 nM, 38.4 μg/mL) to AM1-OVA (167 nM, 45.9
μg/mL) at day 56, even at a lower effective hapten density,
suggesting that the immune system is able to successfully recognize
the monohapten units (Table ). Moreover, a
hapten density as low as 1.98 copies per carrier would likely only
elicit a poor immune response, supporting our hypothesis that clusters
can increase the effective hapten density and contribute to B cell
activation. In turn, AM1(Gly)2-OVA elicited much higher
antibody affinity and concentration (82.2 nM, 82.1 μg/mL) than
AM1-OVA, suggesting that the presence of the polyglycine linker significantly
enhances the immune response. The hapten
density in this case is again lower than that of AM1, which suggests
that this vaccine compares even more favorably than these results
show. A direct comparison of triAM1(Gly)2-OVA and AM1(Gly)2-OVA, which possess very similar effective hapten densities,
leads us to posit that the trivalent scaffold will require additional
“retooling” wherein optimization of the peptidic linker
and protein conjugation chemistry will be required, the goal being
to achieve the postulated antibody concentration (200 μg/mL) required for a successful clinical candidate.
However, having in this study established the powerful underlying
logic of drug–hapten clustering with an ability to display
as much as triple the effective hapten density, we surmise that such
a recourse could yield a highly effective vaccine.

Conclusion
We
have presented new insights into several factors that can greatly
impact drug immunogenicity: hapten clustering, density, linker length,
and its peptidic constitution. While further optimization for each
of these components will be needed, our modular synthetic assembly,
which will allow for efficient iterative improvement of each of these
variables, is noteworthy. Importantly, this modular design should
readily translate to the targeting of any desired drug of abuse. Key
findings from our study are: (1) that a unique hapten cluster, triAM1(Gly)2, was found to elicit a robust immune response that parallels
that of a monovalent display, AM1, despite its lower effective hapten
density; (2) the intermouse variability in the immune response for
this hapten cluster was remarkably diminished in comparison to both
monovalent haptens, AM1 and AM1(Gly)2, a major issue that
has plagued drug abuse vaccines that have advanced to clinical trials.
Finally, it is anticipated that upon optimization of the conjugation
chemistry, increased immunogenicity will be seen with continued limiting
of subject variability.

Conjugation of Haptens
A solution of hapten (150 mM),
EDC.HCl (2.5–5.0 equiv) and sulfo-NHS (1.5–3 equiv)
in 10% H2O/DMF was agitated at rt until complete activation
was observed by LCMS analysis (adding further EDC.HCl if necessary),
whereupon the solvent was removed in vacuo. OVA or BSA (Pierce Imject,
Thermo Fisher) (6.5–10 mg/mL in 100 mM MOPS-buffered saline
(pH 7.2)) was added to the activated hapten AM1 (1) or
AM1(Gly)2 (11) (ca. 145 equiv for OVA, 215
equiv for BSA), triAM1 (7), or triAM1(Gly)2 (10) (ca. 70 equiv for OVA, 100 equiv for BSA) and
the solutions mixed (4 °C, 18–40 h), before the protein
conjugates were dialyzed into PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. OVA conjugates
were used for immunization and BSA conjugates were used for ELISA
plate coating.

BCA Assay for Determination of Protein Concentration
Protein concentrations were determined by a modification of Lowry’s
method, using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce
BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher), with BSA standards. Samples
were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before analysis on a Molecular
Devices SpectraMax 250 plate reader at 562 nm.

MALDI-TOF MS for Determination of Hapten
Density
MALDI-TOF
MS were performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager-DE STR MS using
sinapinic acid as the matrix. Average hapten density was estimated
from the difference in mass of the conjugated carrier protein with
its unconjugated counterpart taking into consideration the mass of
the incorporated hapten unit (comparative MALDI-MS).

Immunization
AM1-OVA, triAM1-OVA,
triAM1(Gly)2-OVA, and AM1(Gly)2-OVA (100 μg)
in PBS (100 μL,
1 mg/mL) formulated with Sigma Adjuvant System (SAS, 100 μL)
were used to immunize groups of five to six BALB/c mice (8 weeks)
via intraperitoneal injection on days 0, 14, and 35. Plasma was collected
via retroorbital puncture on days 21, 42, and 56.

Immunologic
Assays
ELISA
Production of anti-nicotine IgG was evaluated
by ELISA. Costar 3690 microtiter plates were incubated with AM1-BSA
in PBS (5 μg/mL, 25 μL) at 37 °C and the solution
allowed to evaporate, before MeOH fixation. Nonspecific binding was
blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS (30 min, 37 °C). Mouse plasma
in 1% BSA (25 μL) was serially diluted across the plate before
incubation in a moist chamber (1.5 h, 37 °C). After washing with
dH2O, peroxidase-conjugated donkey antimouse IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was added and the plates incubated
in a moist chamber (30 min, 37 °C). After further washing with
dH2O, plates were developed with the TMB substrate kit
(Thermo Pierce) and the absorbance at 450 nm measured on a SpectraMax
M2e Molecular Devices microplate reader. Titers were calculated
as the dilution corresponding to 50% of the maximum absorbance from
a plot of the absorbance versus log(dilution) using GraphPad Prism
5.

Radioimmunoassay (RIA)
Dissociation constants and antibody
concentrations were determined using competitive RIA. Mouse plasma
was pooled and diluted into 2% BSA, giving a concentration that was
determined to bind ca. 40% l-(−)-[N-methyl-3H]-nicotine tracer (20 000–30 000
dpm, 81.7 Ci/mmol (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA)). Diluted plasma (50–75
μL) and nicotine tracer (50–75 μL) in PBS were
added to the sample chamber of a 5 kDa MWCO 96-well Equilibrium Dialyzer
(Harvard Apparatus), and unlabeled (−)-nicotine (100–150
μL) at varying concentrations in 1% BSA was added to the buffer
chamber. After equilibration on a plate rotator (Harvard Apparatus)
at rt (22–26 h), a sample from each chamber (50–75 μL)
was diluted into Ecolite(+) liquid scintillation cocktail (5 mL, MP
Biomedicals) and the radioactivity measured using a Beckman LS 6500
Scintillation Counter. Kds and antibody
concentrations were calculated according to Müller.
