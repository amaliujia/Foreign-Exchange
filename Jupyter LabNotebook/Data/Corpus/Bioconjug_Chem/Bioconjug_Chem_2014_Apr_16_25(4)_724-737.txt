Introduction
The ability to noninvasively
image dead and dying cells within
a living subject is expected to facilitate preclinical research and
personalized medical treatment. In diverse
therapeutic areas like traumatic brain injury, heart attack, and autoimmune
disease, the amount of cell death is an indicator of disease progression,
whereas in other cases, such as oncology, the typical therapeutic
goal is to selectively kill tumor cells. In principle, imaging methods
that quantify the degree of cell death can be used to report the status
of disease, or alternatively the efficacy of treatment. A wide range
of cell death assays have been developed for cell culture and histopathology, and there is an ongoing community effort to translate
these methods to the clinic.− A large number of biomarkers have
been identified for different cell death pathways, but only a subset
are tractable targets for in vivo imaging of living subjects. The
accessibility of cell surface biomarkers makes them especially attractive
as imaging targets and a well-known example in cell death imaging
is the anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS).−

PS comprises roughly 2–10% of total cellular phospholipid
in a typical mammalian cell plasma membrane, but the transmembrane distribution in most healthy cells is highly
asymmetric such that PS is almost exclusively sequestered to the inner
leaflet., A hallmark of most, if not all, cell death
pathways is the appearance of PS in the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane, due to attenuation of the active transport systems that
maintain the asymmetric transmembrane distribution. A promising strategy for in vivo imaging of dead and dying
cells is to develop molecular imaging probes with selective affinity
for anionic PS-rich membranes over the charge-neutral membrane surfaces
of healthy cells., One of the best known molecular
agents for PS imaging is Annexin V, a 35 kDa protein that associates
strongly with PS-rich membranes in a Ca2+-dependent fashion
(low nanomolar dissociation constant). While fluorescently labeled Annexin V has been employed very effectively
in cell death microscopy and flow cytometry protocols, the development
of suitably labeled versions for in vivo imaging remains an ongoing
challenge after twenty years of international effort.− Researchers have started to consider alternative molecules for PS
targeting such as other classes of proteins,− peptides,− and small molecules., Our research lab has contributed
to this effort by demonstrating that synthetic, low-molecular-weight
zinc(II)-bis(dipicolylamine) (Zn-BDPA) coordination complexes have
selective affinity for anionic membranes, including the surfaces of
dead and dying mammalian cells.− The selective targeting of Zn-BDPA probes is driven
by a combination of electrostatic attraction to the anionic membrane
and zinc cation coordination by the phosphate and carboxylate moieties
of the PS headgroup. Effective cell death imaging using Zn-BDPA fluorescent
probes has been achieved in a range of cell culture systems and small
animal models of disease., In vivo imaging protocols
with the current generation of fluorescent Zn-BDPA probes typically
employs relatively high doses because the membrane affinity is modest
(low micromolar dissociation constant). As a necessary step toward eventual clinical imaging applications,
we are attempting to develop next-generation Zn-BDPA probes with enhanced
PS affinity, so they can be employed as tracers.

Recently, we
reported that a multivalent Zn-BDPA fluorescent probe
exhibited increased selectivity for PS-rich membranes and was an effective
imaging agent in cell culture and three animal models of cell death., While the imaging results were impressive, the multivalent probe
showed a tendency to undergo cross-linking and self-aggregation which
can produce undesired pharmacokinetic properties. Another potential
problem with multivalent probes for certain types of imaging applications
is the increased molecular size, which may slow rates of diffusion
into hindered target sites. Here, we
describe an alternative but complementary design strategy that employs
a single Zn-BDPA core scaffold, and attempts to enhance PS recognition
by appending relatively small functional groups. As shown in Scheme , the primary coordination bonding with the two
zinc cations is strengthened by additional secondary noncovalent interactions
with the PS headgroup such as electrostatic attraction, hydrogen bonding,
and hydrophobic insertion into the membrane., The molecular design concept of modified scaffolds has been used
before to enhance binding affinity of Zn-BDPA structures to small,
water-soluble phosphorylated target molecules such as inorganic phosphate,− nucleoside polyphosphates, and phosphorylated
peptides.− However, there is no reported attempt to improve
Zn-BDPA recognition of PS buried in a bilayer membrane. The strategy
of designing modified Zn-BDPA scaffolds de novo using computer modeling
was judged to be unreliable given the structural flexibility of the
Zn-BDPA scaffold and the dynamic, amphiphilic properties of a target
PS-rich bilayer membrane. Instead, we describe here a focused library
approach that decorates a dipicolylamine core structure with various
types and numbers of appended 2-amido substituents. More specifically,
we have fabricated a 25-member library of modified Zn-BDPA library
candidates and tested the affinity of each library candidate for PS-rich
membranes using a novel rapid equilibrium dialysis assay. The screening
identified two lead candidates, and one was converted into a deep-red
fluorescent probe and evaluated in a series of FRET-based vesicle
titration studies, cell microscopy experiments, and in vivo rat tumor
biodistribution measurements. A tangible outcome of this study is
disclosure of a next generation, deep-red fluorescent Zn-BDPA probe
for enhanced molecular imaging of cell death.

Results and Discussion
Library Synthesis
Shown in Chart  is a work flow diagram of the iterative process
of library generation
and screening for selective binding to PS-rich membranes. The three-step
cycle involved: (1) synthesis of structurally modified Zn-BDPA compounds,
(2) high throughput screening using a rapid equilibrium dialysis method,
and (3) confirmation of membrane association ability for lead candidates.
Chart  contains the entire list of 25 modified
DPA scaffolds that were made, converted to zinc(II) complexes, and
screened for membrane affinity. There are four sets of scaffolds:
mono-DPA scaffolds with one or two appended 2-amido substituents (compounds 6 and 10) and bis-DPA scaffolds with two or four
appended 2-amido substituents (compounds 7 and 11). The focus on 2-amido substituents was intentional because
literature precedence suggested that the NH residues were likely to
form attractive hydrogen bonds to the proximal oxyanion residues within
the headgroup of a bound PS (Scheme ).−

Library Generation and Screening
Library of Modified DPA Scaffolds
The synthetic pathways to make scaffolds 6 and 7 are described in Scheme . The synthesis
of N-Boc-protected 2-aminopyridine 5 from commercially available 1 was accomplished in 4
steps and roughly 80% overall yield. Interestingly, when the N-Boc protection of 2 was initially carried
out in the presence of 1.0 mol equiv of Boc2O, a statistical
mixture of unprotected, monoprotected, and bis-protected products
was obtained. To overcome this problem, an excess of Boc2O was employed and the product was isolated solely as the bis-N-Boc protected aminopyridine 3. It is noteworthy
that mono-N-Boc deprotection occurs when the reduction
of ethyl ester 4 to primary alcohol 5 is
conducted using NaBH4 as the reducing agent and CaCl2 as a Lewis acid catalyst. Conversion of compound 5 into either N-Boc-protected aminopyridine 6a or 7a and subsequent deprotection with HCl
in EtOAc yielded free aminopyridines 6b and 7b in modest yield. When the deprotection was attempted under standard
DCM/TFA conditions, large amounts of decomposition were observed.
The 2-aminopyridine group in 6b was successfully converted
into derivatives 6c and 6d by reaction with
the appropriate isocyanate or acid anhydride, respectively. In contrast,
the same reactions with the more congested homologue 7b yielded a mixture of partially reacted products and none of the
desired tetra-acylation product.

The synthetic pathways to make scaffolds 10 and 11 are described in Scheme . The key
intermediate 9 was obtained in 4 steps with roughly 50%
overall yield. The reduction of ethyl ester 3 to aldehyde 8 yielded a mixture of mono- and bis-N-Boc
products that were purified for characterization but used in synthesis
as a mixture of products. Reductive amination of aldehyde 8 in the presence of CaCl2 produced the mono-N-Boc protected aminopyridine 9 which was converted to
either 10a or 11a in good yield. N-Boc deprotection was carried out using HCl in EtOAc to
yield aminopyridines 10b and 11b, which
were reacted with the appropriate acid anhydrides and isocyanates
to yield 10c and 11f–s. The syntheses of related analogues 11d–e is described in the . Each of the modified DPA scaffolds in Chart  was converted to the corresponding Zn2+ complex and then
screened for ability to associate with PS-rich vesicles.

Library Screening
There are few
literature assays that
measure association of small molecules to a model membrane system. The most common is the solid phase adherence
assay that fabricates a target membrane by adsorbing phospholipids
to the interior surfaces of plastic microwell plates. In our hands, this assay was not reproducible, and we were
not confident that the membranes formed by the surface adsorption
process were biologically relevant. Therefore, we searched for a high
throughput screening method using vesicles. After some experimentation, we developed a rapid equilibrium dialysis
(RED) assay using a commercially available apparatus that consisted
of two compartments, source and receiver, separated by a microporous
dialysis membrane (8000 molecular weight cutoff) that we confirmed
was impermeable to 200-nm-diameter vesicles. As illustrated by the schematic cartoon in Figure , the assay assessed the ability of each library member to
be trapped by vesicles on one side of the dialysis membrane. More
specifically, each assay was started by adding a solution of PS-rich
vesicles composed of POPC:Cholesterol:POPS, 65:25:10 (mimic of dead/dying
cell membranes) to the ‘source’ compartment and a single
member of the Zn-BDPA library (12.5 μM) to the ‘receiver’
compartment. The system was allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C for
16 h and the Zn2+ concentration in each compartment was
determined using a colorimetric indicator. Validation experiments
showed that the ratio of Zn2+ concentrations was a measurable
surrogate for the ratio of Zn-BDPA concentration (see ). The results of the RED
screening are presented in Figure  as the
ratio value, [Zn2+]Receiver/[Zn2+]Source, such that lower values represent increased affinity
for PS-rich vesicles; the blue line corresponds to the value for compound 11c, the original unmodified Zn-BDPA. While the complete screening
data set is shown in Figure , the work actually
progressed as an iterative process of four sublibrary synthesis and
screening cycles (Chart ). From this screening
data two lead candidates, 11k and 11o, were
identified. It is worth noting that both compounds have two ureido
substituents with hydrophobic butyl or phenethyl groups, and we infer
that the enhanced affinity for PS-rich vesicles is driven by a combination
of multiple hydrogen bonding interactions with the PS headgroup and
partial hydrophobic insertion into the membrane (Scheme ).

results for the 25 member library of modified Zn-DPA compounds relative
to the original unmodified compound, 11c (B). A low [Zn2+]Receiver/[Zn2+]Source ratio
indicates compounds that have relatively high affinity for PS-rich
vesicles.

The next step in the screening
process was to confirm affinity
to PS-rich membranes and assess membrane selectivity. Two methods
were investigated. The first approach simply repeated the RED assay
measuring the equilibrium position in the presence of different amounts
of either PS-rich vesicles (POPC:Cholesterol:POPS, 65:25:10) or PC
vesicles (POPC:Cholesterol, 25:75; mimics of healthy cells) such that
association constants for library candidates 11k and 11o could be determined. Direct comparison of association
constants for PS-rich and PC vesicles serves as an indicator of probe
selectivity for dead/dying vs healthy cells. These vesicle association
experiments are summarized in the  and they show that the RED assay was able to effectively measure
membrane affinity for different membrane compositions. However, a
significant drawback was the need to conduct multiple RED measurements
which limited throughput and consumed expensive resources. In order
to quickly confirm high affinity to PS-rich membranes, while only
using small amounts of the precious lead candidates, we developed
the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) displacement assay
that is illustrated in Figure . The assay
utilizes FRET from a lipophilic fluorescence energy donor dye 14 that is embedded in the membrane to fluorescent probe 12 as an energy acceptor associated with the vesicle exterior. Displacement of 12 from the vesicle
surface due to preferential binding of a modified Zn-BDPA compound
leads to disruption of the FRET and a diagnostic ratiometric change
in fluorescence emission, as shown in Figure C. A standard method for fitting competitive displacement data was
used to determine the dissociation constants in Table  (titration curves and data treatment are shown in ). The measured dissociation
constants for 11k and 11o are 51 ±
6 nM and 37 ± 8 nM, respectively. The chemical structure of 11o was judged to be the
most promising for further development as an effective deep-red fluorescent
probe for biological imaging.

Fluorescent Probe Synthesis and Screening
Library candidate 11o was conjugated to the deep-red
fluorophore CyAL-5 to make
the fluorescent probe 13. As shown in Scheme  the building block 15() was alkylated with the modified
DPA 9 to provide scaffold 16. Removal of
the N-Boc protecting group produced 17, which was subsequently reacted with 4-fluorophenethyl isocyanate
to yield 18. Treatment of 18 with hydrazine
monohydrate effectively removed the phthalimide protecting group and
produced primary amine 19 which was condensed with CyAL-5
to make apo-13 in high yield (93% for the dye conjugation
step; see  for chemical structure
of CyAL-5). Purification and Zn2+ complexation provided
the fluorescent probe 13 (Figure ). The photophysical properties of 13 () are typical for a deep-red fluorescent
cyanine dye. To ensure good solubility of stock solutions for bioimaging
studies, probe 13 was formulated as an aqueous solution
with a small fraction of DMSO.

vesicles (10 μL total lipid; POPC:14, 99:1; blue
circles) and 13 (C-inset).

The membrane affinity and selectivity of unmodified Zn-BDPA 12 and modified Zn-BDPA 13 were evaluated using
the FRET titration assay in Figure . Similar
to the displacement system above, the assay measures quenching of
membrane embedded, energy donor dye 14 caused by FRET
to acceptor probe 12 or 13 on the vesicle
surface. The derived association constants are listed in Table . The data shows that modified fluorescent probe 13 (Kd = 39 ±
6 nM) has the same affinity for PS-rich membranes as the Zn-BDPA targeting
group 11o (Kd = 37 ± 8 nM) indicating that the attached CyAL-5 fluorophore
acts only as a reporter group and does not affect membrane association.
A comparison of dissociation constants for modified Zn-BDPA 13 and unmodified 12 reveals that 13 has a 3-fold higher affinity for PS-rich vesicles than 12 and also slightly higher selectivity over PC vesicles. Taken together,
the vesicle studies indicate that modified fluorescent probe 13 targets PS-rich membranes over PC membranes better than
the unmodified fluorescent probe 12. The next step of
the research was to compare probe fluorescence imaging performance
in cell culture and living animals.

Cell Studies
A
standard cell vitality assay showed
that probes 12 and 13 are not toxic to mammalian
cells (MDA-MB-231 and CHO-K1) when present at &lt;25 μM (), which is much lower than the concentration
needed for biological imaging. This result agrees with the lack of
toxicity seen in previously published cell and animal imaging studies
using fluorescent Zn-DPA probes.,,

Cell microscopy studies employed cultures of
mammalian cells (MDA-MB-231 and CHO-K1). Samples of dead/dying cells
were generated by treatment with etoposide, a small molecule topoisomerase
inhibitor that is known to induce apoptosis and necrosis. After treatment
with etoposide (5 μM) for 16 h, or media for healthy cells,
the separate cell samples were incubated with 10 μM of either
probe 12 or 13, and subjected to epifluorescence
microscopy. As shown by the representative micrographs in Figure , there was slight staining of healthy cells by
either fluorescent probe, but clear evidence of much stronger probe
targeting to dead/dying cells. Furthermore, the staining of dead/dying
cells by probe 13 was much stronger than the staining
by probe 12. Additional microscopy studies using culture
mixtures of healthy and dead/dying cells showed selective targeting
of probe 13 to the morphologically distinct dead/dying
cells (). Flow cytometry was used
to unambiguously verify the discrimination of dead/dying cells from
healthy cells. In Figure  are overlaid histogram
plots of three separate samples of CHO-K1 cells: healthy unstained
cells (orange), healthy cells stained with probe 13 (red),
and etoposide treated cells stained with 13 (blue). The
histograms show that probe 13 can quantify the fraction
of etoposide treated cells that are either dead/dying or healthy.

for 16 h, then incubated with 10 μM of probe for 30 min at 37
°C and washed with HEPES buffer. Scale bar = 25 μm.

populations of CHO-K1 cells; unstained healthy cells (orange), healthy
cells stained with 10 μM of 13 (red), and cells

of 13 (blue).

A final point with the cell microscopy studies concerns the
cellular
location of the probe staining. Protein-derived fluorescent probes
like Annexin V do not readily penetrate the plasma membranes of apoptotic
cells; thus, they can be used in co-staining protocols to distinguish
early stage apoptotic cells from necrotic cells. Likewise, previous microscopic studies of fluorescent Zn-BDPA
probes have shown that they localize at the periphery of apoptotic
cells. In contrast, the micrographs of
dead/dying cells stained with probe 13 (Figure ) suggest that the probe permeates into the cytosol,
a conclusion supported by additional confocal microscopic imaging
(). However, probe 13 does not enter the cell nucleus, a targeting feature that was confirmed
with co-staining studies using a blue-emitting nucleic acid stain
(). The ability of probe 13 to enter necrotic cells is expected since the cells have
a compromised plasma membrane. The permeation of 13 into
apoptotic cells is unusual but perhaps not surprising, because the
two lipophilic phenethyl ureido groups promote membrane insertion.

Animal Studies
The ability to target dead/dying cells
in a living animal was assessed by determining probe biodistribution
in a rat subcutaneous tumor model that is known to develop necrotic
foci. Previous studies have demonstrated that this an effective animal
model for testing cell death targeting performance of fluorescent
Zn-BDPA probes.,, In this present case, the biodistributions of untargeted deep-red
CyAL-5 dye, unmodified probe 12, and modified probe 13 were determined in tumor-bearing rats and control rats
without tumors. The subcutaneous tumors were prepared by injecting
PAIII prostate cancer cells into the right flank of each animal and
allowing 14 days for tumor growth and development of a necrotic tumor
core. Each cohort was given a tail vein injection of one of the three
fluorescent probes (3.0 mg/kg) in water (10% DMSO). The animals were
euthanized 24 h later and biodistributions were determined by imaging
the excised tissues using a planar fluorescence imaging station with
a deep-red filter set (λex = 590 nm, λem = 670 nm). The biodistribution graphs in  show that the untargeted CyAL-5 dye cleared
rapidly from the body with no significant tumor accumulation. In comparison,
there was much higher tissue retention of probes 12 and 13, with the unmodified probe 12 clearing equally
through kidney and liver, and the modified probe 13 clearing
primarily through the liver. Most importantly, tumor accumulation
of probe 13 was 3-fold higher than probe 12 (Figure ). The spatial distribution of each
probe within the resected tumors was determined by slicing the tumors
in half along the longest axis and acquiring fluorescent images of
the interior-facing surfaces. As shown by the representative images
in Figure , the probe distribution was localized
at the necrotic core of the tumor. Microscopic
imaging of thin histological tumor slices confirmed that the deep-red
fluorescence of probes 12 and 13 colocalized
with the tumor’s necrotic regions (Figure ). Thus, there is strong evidence that probes 12 and 13 target the dead and dying cells in the tumor
tissue, and the 3-fold higher accumulation of probe 13 correlates with its higher affinity for the PS biomarker that is
exposed on the dead/dying cell surface.

Conclusions
An
iterative cycle of library synthesis and screening enabled the
discovery of two modified Zn-BDPA structures, 11k and 11o, that have enhanced affinity for bilayer membranes that
contain the cell death membrane biomarker PS. The screening utilized
a novel rapid equilibrium dialysis (RED) assay to identify lead structures
with high affinity for PS-rich vesicles. Structure 11o was chosen for further testing and conjugated with a CyAL-5 fluorophore
to make the deep-red fluorescent probe, 13. The targeting
and imaging performance of modified probe 13 was compared
with the unmodified control probe 12. The evaluation
process included a series of FRET-based vesicle titration studies,
cell microscopy experiments, and in vivo rat tumor biodistribution
measurements. In all cases, the modified probe 13 exhibited
comparatively higher affinity and selectivity for the target membranes.
It is notable that the RED assay using PS-rich vesicles in buffer
was an accurate screen for identifying modified Zn-BDPA structures
with enhanced affinity for dead/dying cells in culture and dead/dying
tissue in a living animal.

A tangible outcome of this study
is disclosure of 13 as a next-generation deep-red fluorescent
probe for preclinical
molecular imaging of cell death in cell cultures and animal models.
It should be possible to substitute the deep-red fluorophore with
alternative reporter groups that enable clinically useful, deep-tissue
imaging modalities, such as MRI and nuclear imaging. The structure of the targeting group 11o contains
two lipophilic phenethyl ureido groups and it appears that they facilite
probe permeation into the cytosol of dead/dying cells. Thus, the targeting
group, 11o, may have value as a lead structure for further
development as a drug delivery agent that can selectively target and
permeate dying mamallian cells.

Zinc Complexation
Stock solutions
of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (25 mM) and
BDPA scaffolds were
prepared in MeOH and mixed such that the [Zn2+]:[DPA] molar
ratio was 1:1. The solutions were allowed to shake for 1 h before
the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation followed by sitting
under vacuum for a period of at least 1 h.

Preparation of Vesicles
All phospholipids were purchased
from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and stored at −20
°C until use. Appropriately sized aliquots of lipid solutions
were added to a clean, dry test tube. Solvent was removed by evaporation
using a gentle stream of N2 gas. Residual solvent was removed
under vacuum over a period of at least 1 h. Lipids were rehydrated
with the desired buffer. A glass ring was added to the solution to
ensure complete removal of all lipid from the test tube wall and the
solution was vortexed. The suspension was extruded 21 times through
a 19 mm polycarbonate membrane with 200-nm-diameter pores. Vesicles
were used on the day of preparation. For RED studies, PS-rich vesicles
were composed of POPC:Cholesterol:POPS in the molar ratio of 65:25:10
and PC vesicles were composed of POPC:Cholesterol in the molar ratio
of 75:25. For FRET studies, the PS-rich vesicles were composed of
POPS:POPC:14 in the molar ratio of 50:49:1 and the PC
vesicles were composed of POPC:14 in the molar ratio
of 99:1.

Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis (RED) Assay
Qualitative
RED assays were conducted using a single-use RED apparatus (Thermo
Scientific Pierce product number 90006) following the guidelines provided
by the vendor. The apparatus consists of two compartments, ‘source’
and ‘receiver’, separated by an 8000 molecular weight
cutoff membrane that is impermeable to 200-nm-diameter vesicles. Briefly,
a solution of either PS-rich vesicles composed of POPC:Cholesterol:POPS,
65:25:10, or PC vesicles composed of POPC:Cholesterol, 75:25 (1.0
mM total lipid) was added to the ‘source’ compartment
(500 μL) of a RED apparatus while a single member of the Zn-BDPA
library (40 μM) was added to the ‘receiver’ compartment
(750 μL). All RED screens were carried out using TES buffer
(10 mM TES, 145 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and the system was allowed to equilibrate
by shaking at 180 rpm and 37 °C for 16 h. The amount of Zn2+ in each compartment was determined using a colorimetric
indicator, NO2–PAPS (see ). Control experiments
confirmed that unbiased RED equilibration of the Zn-BDPA candidate
occurred in the absence of vesicles.

FRET Displacement Assay
A FRET ensemble of fluorescence
energy acceptor 12 bound to the surface of PS-rich vesicles
containing energy donor 14 was prepared by mixing 12 (10 μM) and PS-rich vesicles (20 μM total lipid;
POPS:POPC:14, 50:49:1) in 2.0 mL of HEPES buffer (5 mM
HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 3.2 mM KCl, 1.0 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, pH 7.4) at 25 °C. Aliquots of lead Zn-BDPA
compounds, 11k or 11o, were titrated into
separate samples of the FRET ensemble while stirring. After waiting
approximately 60 s for equilibration to occur, the fluorescence emission
spectrum was acquired (λex = 480 nm, λem = 500–750 nm). Plots of fluorescence intensity ratio
(I567 nm/I663 nm) as a function of Zn-BDPA concentration were generated and fit using
a computer to a competitive binding model that determined 1:1 association
constants (see ).

FRET Titration Assay
Fluorescent
probes 12 and 13 were titrated separately
into aqueous samples
containing either PS-rich (10 μM total lipid; POPS:POPC:14, 50:49:1) or PC (10 μM total lipid; POPC:14, 99:1) vesicles in 3.0 mL HEPES buffer (5 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl,
3.2 mM KCl, 1.0 mM Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, pH 7.4) at 25 °C while stirring. After waiting approximately
60 s to ensure full equilibration, the fluorescence emission spectrum
was acquired (λex = 480 nm, λem =
500–750 nm). Plots of fluorescence intensity (λem = 567 nm) as a function of probe concentration were generated and
the association constants were determined using a nonlinear least-squares
fitting procedure adapted for fluorescence spectroscopy (see ).

MTT Cell Viability Assay
Quantification of cell toxicity
was measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) cell viability assay. The number of viable cells is
directly correlated to the amount of reduced formazan. Only active
reductase enzymes in living cells can reduce MTT; therefore, high
levels of cell viability are indicated by a purple formazan color.
The relative toxicity of fluorescent probes 12 and 13 can be assayed at different concentrations by comparing
the formazan absorbance at 570 nm.

MDA-MB-231 (human breast
cancer) and CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection, seeded into 96-microwell plates,
and grown to confluency of 85% in RPMI or F-12K media supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% streptavidin l-glutamate
at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The Vybrant MTT cell proliferation
Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, USA) was performed according to the
manufacture’s protocol and validated using 50 μM etoposide
as a positive control for high toxicity. The cells were treated with
either 12 or 13 (0–50 μM) and
incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced
with 100 μL of RPMI or F-12K media containing [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] (MTT, 1.2 mM). An SDS-HCl detergent solution was added and
incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for an additional 4
h. The absorbance of each well was read at 570 nm and normalized to
wells containing no cells or added probe (measured in quadruplicate).

Cell Microscopy Studies
Separately, MDA-MB-231 cells
and CHO-K1 cells were treated with either 15 μM etoposide for
12 h or left untreated in cell media. Cells treated with etoposide
were washed once with HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 3.2
mM KCl, pH = 7.4) before incubation with probe. Fluorescent probes 12 and 13 were suspended in HEPES buffer (1%
DMSO; 1 mM stock) and diluted to a final concentration of 10 μM.
Cells were treated with either 12 or 13 for
30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. An additional wash step
was performed and cells were resuspended in HEPES buffer. The cells
were immediately viewed using a TE-2000U epifluorescence microscope
utilizing the brightfield and Cy5 filter settings (λex = 620/60, λem = 700/75; 60/100× magnification).
Each Cy5 fluorescence micrograph in a sequence was normalized to the
highest fluorescence intensity. For co-staining experiments, populations
of healthy and dead/dying cells were stained with 5 μM SYTOX
Blue, a nucleic acid stain, 15 min prior to staining with 12 or 13. All data was manipulated using ImageJ 1.40g software.

Confocal scanning laser microscopy of MDA-MB-231
cells was performed using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope to examine
the cellular localization of 13 in dead/dying cells.
Etoposide treatment and cell staining was carried out using the same
procedure stated above (15 μM etoposide; 12 h incubation). Sequential
planar images were taken (4 μm apart) of the dead/cying cells
using a 60× microscope objective and a deep-red emission wavelength
filter.

Flow Cytometry Studies
CHO-K1 cells were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection, seeded into three T25 flasks,
and grown to confluency in F-12K media supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, and 1% streptavidin l-glutamate at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. The cells were either treated with 15 μM
etoposide for 13 h or left untreated in cell media. Cells treated
with etoposide were washed once with HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES, 137
mM NaCl, 3.2 mM KCl, pH = 7.4) before incubation with probe. Probe 13 was suspended in HEPES buffer (1% DMSO; 1 mM stock) and
diluted to a final concentration of 10 μM. Cells were treated
with 13 for 15 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Three additional wash steps were performed, cells were treated
with trypsin, and flasks were incubated at 37 °C until cells
were detached. Once detached, the cells were centrifuged at 125g for 10 min. The trypsin was removed from the pellet solution,
and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL HEPES buffer. Flow cytometry
was performed using a Beckman Coulter FC500 Flow Cytometer (FL4 channel;
10 000 cell count, medium flow rate) and histogram plots were
generated using FlowJoIX software.

Rat Biodistribution Studies
All animal handling and
imaging procedures were approved by the University of Notre Dame Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Four week-old male Lobund Wistar rats
(Freimann Life Science Center; 125 g, N = 4) were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank with 1 × 106 Prostate Adenocarcinoma III (PAIII) cells suspended in 300
μL of DMEM medium. Tumors grew for 14 days, then the rats were
injected intravenously via the tail vein with 3 mg/kg of CyAL-5, 12, or 13, in a DMSO/water solution (10% DMSO).
Twenty-four hours after probe injection, the rats were anesthetized
and sacrificed via cervical dislocation. Selected tissues were excised
and placed onto a transparent imaging tray for ex vivo fluorescence
imaging. Epifluorescence images were acquired using a Kodak In Vivo
Multispectral Imaging Station FX (Carestream Health; Rochester, NY)
equipped with 590 ± 10 nm excitation and 670 ± 20 nm emission
filter set. The images were acquired for 30 s at a 190 mm field of
view (f-stop = 2.51, 2 × 2 bin). Tumors were
separated into halves along the longest axis. The tumor halves were
placed onto a transparent imaging tray so the inner cores faced the
camera. The fluorescence images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.40g software. Region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed
by drawing a shape around excised tissue. The mean pixel intensities
were measured and biodistribution results depicted as mean pixel intensities
± standard error of the mean, with statistical analysis using
a Student’s t test. The biodistribution analysis
assumes that the deep-red fluorescence emission for CyAL-5, probe 12, or probe 13 from a specific organ suffers
the same amount of signal attenuation; thus, the mean pixel intensities
for a specific organ reflect the relative probe concentrations.

Histological Analysis
Tumor slices were snap-frozen
in OCT, sliced (5 μm thickness) at −17 °C, adhered
to Unifrost microscope slides (Azer Scientific, USA), fixed with chilled
acetone for 10 min, and air-dried for an additional 20 min. Finally,
a coverslip was adhered, and the slide was allowed to dry for at least
1 h. Brightfield and deep-red fluorescence images of the slices were
acquired using a Nikon TE-2000U epifluorescence microscope equipped
with a Cy5 filter set (λex = 620/60, λem = 700/75). Images were analyzed using ImageJ 1.40g software.
