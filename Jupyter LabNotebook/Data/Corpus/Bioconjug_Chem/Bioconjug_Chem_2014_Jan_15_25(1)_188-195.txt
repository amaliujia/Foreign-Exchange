Introduction
Recently, azide-modified
RNA− has attracted considerable attention for being a valuable addition
to the tool box of RNA bioconjugation., Of particular
interest is the outreach for inverse Click labeling patterns that
would create significantly more flexibility for complex labeling patterns
as, for instance, needed for single-molecule fluorescence resonance
energy transfer (FRET) studies., Also, azide-modified
RNA will provide interesting alternatives to the existing RNA labeling
concepts, such as expanding the range to Staudinger-type ligations. The prevalence of alkyne over azide-modified
DNA and RNA stems from the straightforward integration of the alkyne
functionality into the automated oligonucleotide solid-phase synthesis
cycle using phosphoramidite building blocks.− In contrast,
azide-modified nucleoside phosphoramidites for solid-phase synthesis
would encounter severe limitations because of the inherent reactivity
of P(III) species with azides. Likewise,
the rare encounter of, e.g., Staudinger ligations in the context with
nucleic acids lies in the fact that neither the required azide nor
the required P(III) moiety is easy to align with P(III) phosphoramidite
chemistry for assembly.,,− Hence, reported protocols for Staudinger-based conjugations
on nucleic acids include inconvenient two-step procedures that attach
the required N3 moiety postsynthetically onto amino group-functionalized
RNA, employing N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry. Although efficient enzymatic prefunctionalization
of DNA or RNA based on azide-modified nucleoside triphosphates has
been reported,− such a strategy would not be appropriate if single,
site-specific azide modifications within nucleic acids are required.

Here, we describe the efficient preparation of a solid support
for automated RNA synthesis using phosphoramidite building blocks
that provides RNA with a 3′-terminal 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) group (Figure ). Efficient
labeling with fluorescent dyes is evaluated for an siRNA application
as well as the smooth transformation of the azido-labeled RNA into
the corresponding amine derivative for NHS ester bioconjugation. Furthermore,
potential strategies for diverse multiple label attachments are discussed.
Additionally, our synthetic route opens up a minimal step synthesis
of 2′-O-(2-aminoethyl) modified pyrimidine
nucleoside phosphoramidites which are widely used to prepare amino-functionalized
RNA.

Chemical structure of 3′-end 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl)
derivatized RNA. The modification allows for inverse
Click labeling and selective, stepwise label attachment to RNA with
diverse functional group patterns.

Results and Discussion
Chemical synthesis is the method
of choice to prepare functionalized
RNA with tailored properties. Frequently,
this undertaking demands labeling with moieties that are incompatible
with RNA solid-phase synthesis and, therefore, prefunctionalized RNA
with tethers carrying, e.g., amino or alkyne groups is required. These
anchors can then be transformed by using the classical NHS ester approach
and the more recent Click conjugations, respectively.,,, Our original efforts were driven by the motivation to equip the
same RNA with an additional orthogonal anchor besides amine and alkyne
groups. This goal would be amenable through azide modification that
allows for selective labeling with strained cyclic alkynes, in the presence of both of the other attachment
sites. Interestingly, not many types of chemically synthesized, azide-functionalized
RNAs have been described in the literature, and for their assembly,
the majority requires either phosphonate (e.g., 2′-O-[(2-azidoethoxy)methyl] RNA) or phosphortriester chemistry (e.g., 2′-azido RNA)., Although these approaches are powerful and enable labeling of internal
sequence positions, they require adjustments of standard RNA synthesis
procedures which can represent a handicap for broader applications.
Another recent promising approach to generate 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) modified nucleic acids involves a convertible nucleoside,
but this approach has been demonstrated thus far for DNA only. Here, we intended to create a fast and simple
access to azide labeled RNA even if restrictions with respect to positioning
of the azide group were encountered. For many applications, in particular,
for multiple, specific labeling of DNA, or RNA,,, 3′-end azide anchors would
be a major asset, provided the approach is facile and applicable to
standard phosphoramidite chemistry.

We recall a previous report
by Morvan and co-workers on a universal
solid support for 3′-end azide labeling of DNA and our own studies on 3′-deoxy-3′-azido
RNA that are compatible with the usage
of nucleoside phosphoramidites. However, for the present study we
aimed at an approach that keeps the 3′-OH of the oligoribonucleotide
available to retain the possibility for ligations to construct larger
RNA, e.g., by using in vitro selected DNA ligation
enzymes. Hence, we focused on the ribose
2′-O position for derivatization and favored
the 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) group. Nucleosides
of this type and with defined protecting group patterns have been
reported as intermediates for the synthesis of 2′-O-(2-aminoethyl) modified DNA and RNA., However, applying
such pathways would involve multiple steps. Here, we aimed at a one-step
protecting group-free synthesis using the substrates 2,2′-anhydrouridine 1 and 2-azidoethanol (which are commercially available or
can be prepared by a single transformation from the precursors uridine and 2-chloroethanol, respectively) in the presence of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate
(Scheme ). The procedure was eleborated based
on reports by Egli and Sekine who demonstrated the corresponding transformation
with a series of other alcohol derivatives. After careful optimization,
the desired 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) uridine 2 was achieved in acceptable yields. Compound 2 was then readily tritylated, then transformed into the corresponding
pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) adipic acid ester, and finally into the functionalized
solid support 3.

Synthesis of the Solid Support 3 for 3′-End 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl)
Modified RNA
Reaction conditions: (a) 5
equiv HOCH2CH2N3, 2.5 equiv BF3·OEt2 in dimethylacetamide, 120 °C,
16 h, 55%; (b) 1.1 equiv DMT-Cl, in pyridine, 16 h, RT, 75%; (c) 3.5
equiv PfpOOC(CH2)4COOPfp, 1.2 equiv DMAP, in
DMF/pyridine (1:1), room temperature, 1 h, 47%; (d) 3 equiv (w/w)
amino-functionalized support (GE Healthcare, Custom Primer Support
200 Amino), 2 equiv pyridine, in DMF, room temperature, 48 h, loading:
60 mmol g–1.

The solid support 3 was efficiently used for automated
RNA strand assembly using nucleoside phosphoramidite building blocks
(Table ). Standard cleavage and deprotection
procedures resulted in high-quality crude products as exemplified
in Figure A (top). The integrity of the azide-modified
RNA was confirmed by LC-ESI mass spectrometry (Figure A, bottom). We also note that 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) modified RNAs were efficiently reduced to the 2′-O-(2-aminoethyl) modified counterparts by incubation with
tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) in aqueous solution
(Figure). Thus, the azidoethyl
moiety can be used as a temporarily masked amino anchor for sequential
labeling of RNA that is functionalized together with an internal 2′-O-(2-aminoethyl) or 5-aminoallyl pyrimidine modification,
using NHS ester conjugation reactions only.

Furthermore,
we demonstrated the convenience of the 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) RNA label in a typical azide–alkyne
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (Click chemistry), (Figure B, Table ). We applied the copper-catalyzed version with acetonitrile as cosolvent
acting as ligand of the CuI complex, stabilizing the oxidation state. The labeled RNA strand at 1 mM concentration
was efficiently reacted with a commercially available, alkyne-modified
5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine dye (F545) (2 mM) in the presence of
sodium ascorbate, and analyzed by anion exchange chromatography (Figure B). For reasons of comparability, we chose the siRNA
sequence system used previously to knock down the brain acid-soluble
protein 1 gene (BASP1) by transient siRNA nucleofection
in the chicken DF-1 cell line.,, Expression of the BASP1 gene is specifically suppressed
by Myc, an evolutionary conserved oncoprotein; conversely, the BASP1 protein is an efficient inhibitor
of Myc-induced cell transformation.

Three dye-labeled siRNAs were annealed, one labeled at the 3′-end
of the antisense strand, the second labeled at the 3′-end of
the sense strand, and the third labeled at both 3′-ends (Figure A). All three siRNA were efficiently nucleofected
into chicken DF1 cells and localized by fluorescence microscopy (Figure B). Not unexpectedly, due to the stringent structural
requirements for antisense strand recognition within the RISC complex,, efficient silencing (comparable to the unmodified reference duplex)
was only observed for the sense labeled siRNA duplex, while both siRNAs
with 3′-labeled antisense strands were inactive, as analyzed
by Northern blot hybridization (Figure C).
The finding that the activity of the siRNA carrying a large chemical
moiety is well tolerated only when it is placed at the 3-terminus
of the sense strand is in accordance with our own previous findings and those by others.−

To further demonstrate
the usefulness of 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) RNA,
we performed efficient dual fluorescent labeling
of strands that additionally contained 5-aminoallyl uridine modifications,
using NHS-chemistry and strain-promoted alkyne—azide conjugation
(SPAAC). The sequence represents a preQ1 class-I riboswitch aptamer, and
the obtained cyanine dye pattern is applicable for bulk FRET investigations
(Table , Figure , ).

The efficient approach
to 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl)
labeled RNA and their applications can be mainly attributed to the
one-step synthesis of the key compound 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) uridine 2. This derivative additionally
opens up a convenient route with minimal steps to 2′-O-(2-aminoethyl) uridine phosphoramidites (Scheme ). 2′-O-(2-Aminoethyl) modified
nucleic acids have been extensively studied for various purposes,− and interestingly, the reported syntheses of the building blocks
usually entail initial alkylation of the ribose 2′-OH by methyl
bromoacetate followed by a series of transformation reactions, or involve extended protecting group concepts.− The route presented
here relies on tritylation of the azide 2, followed by
azide to amine reduction under Staudinger conditions and trifluoroacetylation
to give derivative 4. After phosphitylation, the corresponding uridine building block was
obtained in excellent overall yield in only five steps from uridine.

Conclusions
The presented approach to 3′-terminal
azide-modified RNA
is significant for diverse applications in RNA biochemistry and RNA
chemical biology as exemplified here for fluorescently labeled siRNAs.
Another potential of this type of modification lies in the combined
prefunctionalization together with amino (and, in principle, also
with alkyne) moieties of the same RNA to allow for selective and stepwise
attachment of sensitive moieties that cannot be directly incorporated
into RNA. Efficient generation of complex labeling patterns is, e.g.,
required for multicolor single-molecule FRET studies and is currently
undertaken in our laboratory.

Experimental Procedures
General Remarks
1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 300 MHz or Avance II+ 600 MHz
instrument. The chemical shifts are referenced to the residual proton
signal of the deuterated solvents: CDCl3 (7.26 ppm), d6-DMSO (2.49 ppm) for 1H NMR spectra;
CDCl3 (77.0 ppm) or d6-DMSO
(39.5 ppm) for 13C NMR spectra (see also ). 1H- and 13C-assignments
were based on COSY and HSQC experiments. MS experiments were performed
on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage MAX ion trap instrument. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Marchery-Nagel Polygram SIL
G/UV254 plates. Flash column chromatography was carried out on silica
gel 60 (70–230 mesh). All reactions were carried out under
argon atmosphere. Chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from
commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Organic
solvents for reactions were dried overnight over freshly activated
molecular sieves (4 Å).

to 120 °C. 2-Azidoethanol (1250 mg, 14.3 mmol) was injected into
the solution and the mixture was refluxed for 16 h. After the reaction
was finished solvents were removed in vacuo, and the oily residue

mg [12 μL], 154 μmol). Then, amino-functionalized solid
support (GE Healthcare, Custom Primer Support 200 Amino, 323 mg) was
added. The suspension was agitated for 48 h at room temperature and
the beads were collected on a Büchner funnel. The beads were
washed with N,N-dimethylformamide,
methanol, and dichloromethane and dried. Capping was performed by
treatment of the beads with a mixture of 3.0 mL of solution A (acetic
anhydride/2,4,6-trimethylpyridine/acetonitrile, 2/3/5) and 3.0 mL
of solution B (4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine/acetonitrile,

RNA Solid-Phase Synthesis
Standard
phosphoramidite
chemistry was applied for RNA strand elongation using solid support 3: for the synthesis 2′-O-TOM standard
RNA nucleoside phosphoramidite building blocks were purchased from GlenResearch and ChemGenes, the polystyrene
support from GE Healthcare (Custom Primer
Support, 80 μmol/g; PS 200). All oligonucleotides were
synthesized on a ABI 392 Nucleic Acid Synthesizer following standard methods: detritylation (80 s) with dichloroacetic
acid/1,2-dichloroethane (4/96); coupling (2.0 min) with phosphoramidites/acetonitrile
(0.1 M × 130 μL) and benzylthiotetrazole/acetonitrile (0.3
M × 360 μL); capping (3 × 0.4 min, Cap A/Cap B = 1/1)
with Cap A: 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine in acetonitrile (0.5 M) and
Cap B: Ac2O/sym-collidine/acetonitrile
(2/3/5); oxidation (1.0 min) with I2 (20 mM) in THF/pyridine/H2O (35/10/5). The solutions of amidites and tetrazole, and
acetonitrile were dried over activated molecular sieves (4 Å)
overnight.

Deprotection of 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl)
Modified RNA
The solid support was treated with MeNH2 in EtOH (33%, 0.5 mL) and MeNH2 in water (40%,
0.5 mL) for 7 h at room temperature. (For RNA containing 5-aminoallyl
uridines, the column was first treated with 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile
(20 mL), washed with acetonitrile (20 mL) and dried. Then, the solid
support was treated with MeNH2 in EtOH (33%, 1 mL) and
NH3 in H2O (28%, 1 mL) for 10 min at room temperature
and 20 min at 65 °C.) The supernatant was removed from and the
solid support was washed three times with ethanol/water (1/1, v/v).
The supernatant and the washings were combined with the deprotection
solution of the residue and the whole mixture was evaporated to dryness.
To remove the 2′-silyl protecting groups, the resulting residue
was treated with tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate (TBAF·3H2O) in THF (1 M, 1 mL) at 37 °C overnight. The reaction
was quenched by the addition of triethylammonium acetate (TEAA) (1
M, pH 7.4, 1 mL). The volume of the solution was reduced and the solution
was desalted with a size exclusion column (GE Healthcare,
HiPrep 26/10 Desalting; 2.6 × 10 cm;
Sephadex G25) eluating with H2O; the collected fraction
was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 1 mL H2O. Analysis
of the crude RNA after deprotection was performed by anion-exchange
chromatography on a Dionex DNAPacPA-100 column (4 mm × 250 mm) at 80 °C. Flow rate: 1 mL/min,
eluant A: 25 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M urea; eluant B: 25 mM
Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaClO4, 6 M urea; gradient:
0–60% B in A within 45 min or 0–40% B in 30 min for
short sequences up to 15 nucleotides, UV-detection at 260 nm.

Purification
of 2′-O-(2-Azidoethyl)
Modified RNA
Crude RNA products were purified on a semipreparative Dionex DNAPac PA-100 column (9 mm × 250 mm) at 80 °C
with flow rate 2 mL/min. Fractions containing RNA were loaded on a
C18 SepPak Plus cartridge (Waters/Millipore), washed with 0.1–0.15 M (Et3NH)+HCO3–, H2O and eluted with H2O/CH3CN (1/1). RNA containing fractions were lyophilized.
Analysis of the quality of purified RNA was performed by anion-exchange
chromatography with same conditions as for crude RNA; the molecular
weight was confirmed by LC-ESI mass spectrometry. Yield determination
was performed by UV photometrical analysis of oligonucleotide solutions.

Mass Spectrometry of 2′-O-(2-Azidoethyl)
Modified RNA
All experiments were performed on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage MAX ion trap instrumentation connected
to an Amersham Ettan micro LC system. RNA sequences
were analyzed in the negative-ion mode with a potential of −4
kV applied to the spray needle. LC: Sample (200 pmol RNA dissolved
in 30 μL of 20 mM EDTA solution; average injection volume: 30
μL); column (Waters XTerraMS, C18 2.5 μm; 1.0 × 50 mm) at 21 °C; flow rate: 30
μL/min; eluant A: 8.6 mM TEA, 100 mM 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoroisopropanol
in H2O (pH 8.0); eluant B: methanol; gradient: 0–100%
B in A within 30 min; UV-detection at 254 nm.

Copper-Catalyzed Azide–Alkyne
Cycloaddition (CuAAC) Labeling
2′-O-(2-Azidoethyl) modified RNA (60 nmol)
was lyophilized in a 1 mL Eppendorf tube. Then, aqueous solutions
of F545 (Acetylene-Fluor 545, Click Chemistry Tools), CuSO4, and sodium ascorbate were added consecutively;
acetonitrile was added as cosolvent to
reach final concentrations of 1 mM RNA, 2 mM dye, 5 mM CuSO4, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, and a H2O/acetonitrile ratio
of 4/1 in a total reaction volume of 60 μL. The reaction mixture
was degassed and stirred for 3 to 4 h under argon atmosphere at 50
°C. To monitor the reaction and to purify the reaction mixtures,
anion exchange HPLC as described above was used.

Double Labeling
Using N-Hydroxysuccinimide
Ester (NHS) Chemistry and Strain-Promoted Alkyne–Azide Cycloadditions
(SPAAC)
Lyophilized 3′-end 2′-O-(2-azidoethyl) RNA (25 nmol) containing a single 5-(E-3-aminoprop-1-enyl)uridine (5-aminoallyl uridine) was dissolved
in labeling buffer (25 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) and DMSO (55%
vol/vol) with a final concentration of 225 μM RNA and 1.125
mM Sulfo-Cy3-NHS ester in a total volume of 110 μL. The reaction
mixture was shaken for 5 h at room temperature in the dark. Then,
the RNA was precipitated with absolute ethanol (2.5 volumes of labeling
reaction) and a 1 M aqueous solution of sodium acetate (0.2 volumes
of labeling reaction), for 4 h at −20 °C. The suspension
was centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 13 000 × g to remove the excess of unreacted and hydrolyzed dye.
The pellets were dried under high vacuum and dissolved in nanopure
water and DMSO (50% vol/vol) to reach final concentrations of 312
μM RNA and 686 μM ADIBO derivatized Cy5 dye in a total
volume of 80 μL. The reaction mixture was shaken for 3 h at
room temperature in the dark. To monitor the reaction and to purify
the reaction mixtures, anion exchange HPLC as described above was
used.

RNA Interference and Northern Analysis
Delivery of
siRNAs into cells and analysis of gene silencing were done essentially
as described.,, Lyophilized
synthetic siRNA (for sequence see Figure  and ) targeted against the chicken BASP1 mRNA sequence 5′-CAGGUCUCUGCCAAUAAGACA-3′,
were dissolved in a buffer containing 100 mM potassium acetate, 30
mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), and 2 mM magnesium acetate, yielding a 40 μM
siRNA solution. The solution was heated at 90 °C for 1 min, incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h, and then stored at −80 °C. For
transfection of siRNA, 5 × 106 cells of the chicken
fibroblast line DF-1 were pelleted at 50 × g for 5 min at room temperature, suspended in 100 μL of nucleofector
solution V (Lonza/Amaxa), and mixed with 12 μL
of siRNA solution containing 0.24 nmol (∼3.0 μg) of duplex
RNA. The mixture was subjected to electroporation (Lonza/Amaxa) using the nucleofector program U-20, and then immediately diluted
with 0.5 mL of culture medium. Transfected cells were seeded onto
60-mm dishes containing 4 mL of culture medium and cultivated at 37
°C. Medium was changed after one day, and total RNA was isolated
after two days with the RiboPure Kit (Ambion). Briefly, cells were homogenized in a solution containing phenol
and guanidine thiocycanate. After addition of bromochloropropane,
RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by binding to a glass-fiber
filter and subsequent elution using a low-salt buffer. Northern analysis
using 5 μg of total RNA and specific DNA probes for detection
of BASP1 or GAPDH mRNAs was performed
as described previously.
