The
regulation of surface levels of protein is critical for proper
cell function and influences properties including cell adhesion, ion
channel contributions to current flux, and the sensitivity of surface
receptors to ligands. Here we demonstrate a two-color labeling system
in live cells using a single fluorogen activating peptide (FAP) based
fusion tag, which enables the rapid and simultaneous quantification
of surface and internal proteins. In the nervous system, BK channels
can regulate neural excitability and neurotransmitter release, and
the surface trafficking of BK channels can be modulated by signaling
cascades and assembly with accessory proteins. Using this labeling
approach, we examine the dynamics of BK channel surface expression
in HEK293 cells. Surface pools of the pore-forming BKα subunit
were stable, exhibiting a plasma membrane half-life of &gt;10 h. Long-term
activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin reduced BKα surface
levels by 30%, an effect that could not be attributed to increased
bulk endocytosis of plasma membrane proteins. This labeling approach
is compatible with microscopic imaging and flow cytometry, providing
a solid platform for examining protein trafficking in living cells.

Introduction
Protein trafficking
is tightly regulated in all cells and mediates
important functions such as receptor signaling, cell–cell contacts,
cell adhesion, nutrient uptake, and membrane excitability. For excitable
cells, channel distribution at the plasma membrane (PM) can strongly
influence membrane potential and stimulus–response coupling.1 Analysis of protein surface expression is limited
by cumbersome techniques, including biotinylation of surface proteins,
immunofluorescence using ectofacial epitopes, and the use of pH-dependent
fluorophores. Similarly, real-time dynamics of surface protein trafficking
have been difficult to visualize due to the time scales required for
these experiments. Biotinylation is useful to measure population surface
protein levels, but cannot label intracellular stores. While immunofluorescence
can be employed to quantify surface fraction of a protein, labeling
in this manner employs subsequent permeabilization and staining steps,
requiring cell fixation. Although pH-dependent fluorophores such as
pHluorin2 are useful for imaging surface
proteins in live cells, whole cell quantification is obscured by fluorescence
from neutral intracellular compartments such as endoplasmic reticulum
(ER),3 and detection of protein contained
within acidic compartments requires alkaline unmasking steps. Surface
levels of protein are influenced by a number of cellular mechanisms
including changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, trafficking,
and degradation. We sought to create a method that enables quantitation
of surface and internal protein levels that could be used to characterize
these dynamic processes.

The large conductance, voltage- and
calcium-activated potassium
(BK) channel, (KCNMA1/Maxi-K/Slo1), requires both depolarization and increases in intracellular Ca2+ for channel opening.4,5 BK channels regulate
membrane potential and excitability in multiple cell types, notably
in neurons and vascular smooth muscle.6−13 The diversity of BK channel properties in different tissues is driven
by extensive alternative splicing of the pore-forming α subunit,
which then exhibits varied degrees of surface localization and voltage
gating.9,12,14−17 In addition, the tetrameric BKα complex associates with various
tissue and cell-type specific β subunits that control channel
currents and subcellular localization.6,7,9,16,18−21

Post-translational modifications to the α subunit, including
phosphorylation and palmitoylation, can exert robust and rapid changes
in channel function, effects that are isoform dependent.22,23 For example, phosphorylation of BKα by protein kinase A (PKA)
promotes BK channel opening for some splice isoforms but not others.23−27 Multiple kinases, including PKA, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase
(PKG), and protein kinase C (PKC), can regulate BK channel currents.26,28−30 Although the biophysical effects of BK channel phosphorylation
have been extensively investigated, the regulation of BK channel trafficking
to the PM has been relatively ignored. Whole-cell BK channel currents
are determined in part by the PM localization of the channel,15,31,32 a point that is especially relevant
to pathological alterations in BK channel function in epilepsy,6,11,33 hypertension, and bladder dysfunction.8,28 While modulation of channel opening can induce a rapid and reversible
change in cell excitability, alterations in BK channel trafficking
and localization could underlie long-lasting changes in cell activity,
especially relevant to the development and progression of disease
states.6,11,20 Our motivation
to determine if intracellular signaling modifies BKα trafficking
to increase or decrease surface expression calls for a new quantitative
technique.

Here we demonstrate a novel method for the rapid
and simultaneous
detection of both surface and internal protein in living cells using
fluorogen-activating peptides (FAPs). Using the previously established
dL5** FAP,34 we generated an N-terminal,
FAP-BKα fusion construct, where the FAP is localized on the
extracellular portion of the channel. We synthesized a novel, cell-permeable,
rapidly activated, and highly fluorogenic dye (4-{[Bis(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-methylene]-amino}-butyric
acid ethyl ester; MHN-ester) that produces an activated fluorescence
spectra similar to GFP when bound by FAP. In combination with a malachite
green (MG)-based fluorogen emitting in the far-red spectral range,34,35 this enables simultaneous detection of two subpopulations of FAP
depending on bound dye. When MHN-ester is used together with a cell-impermeable
MG, extra- and intracellular stores of the FAP-BKα channel can
be distinguished, effectively producing a system for green-inside
red-outside (GIRO) labeling in living cells. This labeling qualitatively
recapitulates surface and internal labeling by immunofluorescence
methods, but is performed in live cells to monitor real-time changes
in protein distribution, is highly quantitative (since each FAP binds
a single dye molecule), and takes minutes rather than hours. We used
GIRO labeling to reveal the dynamics of BKα PM residency. We
found that the rate of surface turnover of BKα expressed in
HEK293 cells is slow, and that chronic adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation
can preferentially reduce the surface levels of BKα. These results
suggest a cellular mechanism by which intracellular signaling cascades
can alter the abundance of surface BK channels, a route for modifying
neural excitability.

Results and Discussion
The FAP system
is uniquely suited to studying trafficking; fluorescent
signals are generated based on the specific interaction of the dye-binding
peptide and fluorogen dyes.34,35 Chemical modifications
to the dye can limit its access to the FAP, producing spatially constrained
fluorescence activation, such as at the cell surface.36−38 Because the chromophore is formed by the fluorogen dye, generation
of alternative dyes which are bound by the same FAP enables the control
of fluorescent colors based on which dyes are used.39 By combining this color-selection with control of cell
permeability, we aimed to develop a method to label surface and internal
protein pools with simultaneous detection using a pair of fluorogen
dyes, one designed to be cell-impermeable, thus only labeling cell-surface
FAP, and a second, spectrally distinct, cell-permeable dye that would
be bound at the remaining intracellular sites (Figure 1A).

We have previously characterized a cell-excluded MG-derivative
(2-({4-[(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)oxy]-4-oxobutanoyl}amino)ethanesulfonate;
MG-BTau) to label surface-exposed FAP.38 For a spectrally distinct counterpart, we developed the novel cell-permeable
dye, MHN-Ester (Figure 1B,C). Both dyes are nonfluorescent in solution, but produce spectrally
distinct absorption and emission when bound to the FAP (Table 1 and Figure S.1A), allowing for simultaneous detection of different protein
populations. In all cases, the FAP used was dL5**, a tandem dimer
of L5 originally developed as a tight binder and activator of MG;34,35 this results in a complete high-affinity (Kd = 18 pM) dye-binding module expressed as a single fusion
peptide. MHN-Ester was designed to exploit the binding properties
of dL5** identified from the L5+MG crystal structure.34 MHN-Ester is prepared from a four-step synthesis (Figure 1C). Purified FAP
tightly binds MHN-Ester in solution, with a measured dissociation
constant of 42.5 ± 5.7 pM (Table 1 and Figure S.1B). The quantum
yield for the activated fluorogen complex was determined to be 0.30
(Table 1 and Figure S.1C). Cell-permeable ester dyes showed
proper intracellular accessibility at concentrations below 1 μM,
while sulfonated analogs were cell-excluded (Figure S.2).

Design and Validation of
FAP-BKα
FAP was fused
to the extracellular N-terminus of the ZERO isoform of BKα,
allowing FAP access to the extracellular environment (Figure 2A). An HA tag was included
at the very N-terminus of the FAP for immunohistochemical verification,
since there are no antibodies against either the FAP or extracellular
BKα epitopes. HEK293 cells stably expressing FAP-BKα were
established. Sequential dye addition provided optimal quantitative
labeling of surface and internal proteins. MG-BTau (300 nM) was added
first in order to saturate surface-exposed FAP. After a 5 min incubation,
MHN-Ester (300 nM) was added to occupy all unbound sites. With its
low Kd and slow off-rate,38 MG-BTau labeling is effectively irreversible over these
short experimental time scales. We identified no measurable displacement
of complexed MG-BTau by MHN-Ester either microscopically or in suspension
measured by flow cytometry (Figure S.3),
even after washing. These features of the fluorogen+FAP complexes
enabled the design of a surface and internal dual-sensor.

are at 0.44 for internal and 0.82 for surface labeling. Profile plot

from 3 experiments for each condition. Scale bars = 40 μm.

A clear advantage of the FAP system
is that unbound dye remains
nonfluorescent in solution, allowing for the simple addition of dyes
to the cellular media without any need for fixation or washout, and
enabling live-cell imaging.35 This can
be compared to the traditional method of using immunofluorescence
against an ectofacial epitope in nonpermeabilized cells. Immunofluorescence
using an anti-BKα antibody showed similar localization for FAP-BKα
and untagged BKα transfected into HEK-293 cells (Figure S.4), suggesting that the addition of
the FAP tag does not measurably disrupt BKα trafficking. In
stably transfected FAP-BKα cells, HA-immunofluorescence without
permeabilization resulted in a strong PM signal with a distinct restriction
to the cell surface (Figure 2B). Subsequent staining following permeabilization revealed
clear internal localization. This labeling process took approximately
8 h to perform. In contrast, sequential labeling with MG-BTau and
MHN-Ester can be complete in as little as 7 min and similarly showed
visible segregation of surface and internal signals (Figure 2C). Profile plots were drawn
from the center of the nucleus to the outside edge of the PM along
the longest axis. Because cells are not uniform in size or shape,
and fixed cells tend to be wider due to the mounting process, distance
was normalized (Figure 2D,E). We found that surface and internal labeling by immunofluorescence
or GIRO yielded similar distributions for surface and internal channels.
Interestingly, GIRO labeling exhibited lower intracellular background
compared to immunostaining as shown by the magnitude of signal to
the left of the peaks; this is potentially a result of flattening
of the cells and a limited degree of membrane permeability conferred
by fixation and coverslip mounting. Thus, MG-BTau successfully labels
the cell-surface FAP while MHN-Ester labels internal protein; both
channels can be quantified simultaneously with clear spectral discrimination.
GIRO labeling recapitulates established antibody methods with the
distinct advantages of being more rapid with lower background and
applicable to live cells.

Dye Properties and Activation in Flow Cytometry
The
GIRO labeling system functions as a “smart-probe” distinguishing
and reporting protein localization simply based on color in live cells.
In this way, we can quantify levels of surface protein, internal protein,
and use the ratio of surface to internal signal to generate a measure
of relative surface expression (RSE). Flow cytometry presents an advantageous
application of this system, as it is significantly higher throughput
and more unbiased than region-of-interest selection or cell segmentation
in microscopy. We confirmed specific binding using whole-cell fluorescence
by flow cytometry. By measuring MHN-Ester fluorescence intensity in
cells through a range of concentrations from 5 pM to 600 nM, we found
a labeling Keff of 7.62 (±0.82) nM
(Figure S.5A), with saturating levels below
300 nM. We opted to use 300 nM MHN-Ester in experiments since this
saturates signal without unnecessary contribution to nonspecific background
(Figure S.5B). Next, in order to optimize
our labeling paradigm for flow cytometry, we characterized the rates
of dye activation and saturation using flow-cytometric timecourse
measurements. MHN-Ester binding saturates rapidly, reaching a plateau
in less than 2 min (Figure 3A). Application of MG-BTau prior to MHN-Ester addition causes
a roughly 6% decrease in maximum MHN-ester intensity (Figure 3B) demonstrating that the MG-BTau
labeled population reduces available sites for MHN-ester binding and
that the majority of FAP-BKα is internal. The tetrameric BKα
subunit contains 4 FAP molecules each of which can independently bind
only one molecule of dye. This consistent labeling stoichiometry enables
reliable quantitation not possible with standard immunofluorescence,
which can vary in the number of bound antibodies and fluorophores
per antibody.

Figure 3 MHN-Ester addition to FAP-BKα expressing cells shows
rapid
fluorescence activation. (A) MHN-Ester activation rate was measured
by flow cytometry. Representative smoothed curves show rapid activation
and signal saturation within 2 min of dye addition. A small decrease
in MHN-Ester signal as a result of MG-BTau precomplexing is evident.
(B) Quantification of end point MHN-Ester signal with and without
precomplexing of MG-BTau, showing a small but statistically significant
decrease in saturation level signal (3 experiments for each condition,
** p ≤ 0.01, Student’s t test with Welch’s correction).

Disruption of Global Trafficking Pathways Alters Relative Surface
Expression
To validate the response of the two-color labeling
system, cellular trafficking pathways were pharmacologically suppressed
to observe changes in surface and internal labeling in FAP-BKα
expressing cells. This approach validates the sensitivity of this
labeling approach to subtle changes in protein distribution, and establishes
the lifetime of BKα at the cell surface, which has not previously
been characterized. These experiments were carried out in stably transfected
HEK293 cells, due to their lack of endogenous BKα or β
subunits, which can alter trafficking.14,15,18−20,40 To confirm that changes in trafficking can be monitored using GIRO
labeling, forward trafficking was blocked with the ER-export inhibitor
brefeldin A (BFA; 5 μM), allowing measurement of the removal
of channels from the PM over time. Representative flow cytometry histograms
from BFA-treated, FAP-BKα-expressing cells show a large fluorescence
reduction from surface MG-BTau emission, with a comparatively meager
reduction in the MHN-Ester signal after 18 h BFA treatment (Figure 4A). Quantification
of median surface MG-BTau signal shows a continuous decrease over
time from 1 to 18 h (Figure 4B), with significant effects appearing at 3 h. In the same
cells, internal signal from MHN-Ester labeling showed a minimal change.
A statistically significant reduction in internal labeling is observable
after 18 h, possibly due to diversion of BKα to degradation
pathways with this extended blockade of ER export. By taking the relative
ratio of median surface and internal signal, a significant 22.3% reduction
in RSE was observed after 6 h. At 18 h, RSE was reduced by 71.6% compared
to vehicle-treated control cells (Figure 4C). We conclude that FAP-BKα turnover
in HEK293 cells is slow, with a PM residency half-time in the tens
of hours.

0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, **** p ≤ 0.0001.

We next analyzed delivery
to the PM by blocking endocytosis (and
hence removal from the PM) with the dynamin 1/2 inhibitor dynasore.
Dynasore (50 μM) was applied for 1, 3, and 6 h. Representative
histograms of fluorescence intensity (Figure 4D) at 6 h show an increase in surface MG-BTau
fluorescence but not in MHN-ester fluorescence (Figure 4E). We observed a steady and significant
increase in RSE over time; with a significant 27.0% increase after
6 h (Figure 4F). This
increase in surface levels induced by dynasore appears to be in equilibrium
with the measured decrease in BFA treated cells. Taken together, BKα
delivery and removal from the cell surface in these stable cells appears
to be in equilibrium, and GIRO labeling has sufficient precision to
detect these changes.

Forskolin (Fsk) Reduces BKα Surface
Expression
In the brain, AC acts as a signaling nexus for
neuromodulators, critical
in effecting synaptic plasticity by activation of downstream signaling
targets. One such target, PKA, is well-characterized in regulating
the biophysical properties of BK channels.23,25−27,29,30,41 Phosphorylation-dependent modification
of channel opening properties provides short- to medium-term regulation
of BK currents, readily reversed by phosphatases. Longer-term regulation
of cellular BK channel currents could involve reduction or enhancement
of channel density at the PM, and changes in overall expression level
of the channel. Given PKA’s established interactions with the
BKα C-terminal domain and its known involvement in trafficking
of receptors and other ion channels,42−44 we decided to examine
the effect of AC activation on surface expression of FAP-BKα
by overnight treatment with 25 μM fsk.

Examination of
FAP-BKα expressing cells qualitatively by microscopy (Figure 5A) and quantitatively
by flow cytometry (Figure 5B) showed a substantial and significant decrease in cell surface
labeling accompanied by a meager reduction in internal labeling after
fsk treatment. Indeed, quantification of median fluorescence in flow
cytometry (Figure 5C–E) showed a 38% decrease in surface labeling compared to
vehicle-treated control samples. Internal labeling of FAP-BKα
was also significantly decreased, but this decrease was to a lesser
extent than surface labeling (15.3% decrease). This led to a significant
31% decrease in RSE. For comparison, a constitutively expressed FAP
construct targeted to the PM (FAP-TM, Figure 5A) was expressed in HEK293 cells. FAP-TM
contains a transmembrane domain derived from platelet-derived growth
factor receptor 1 to confer surface expression; it contains no PKA
phosphorylation sites or characterized trafficking signals. In contrast
to FAP-BKα, FAP-TM showed no change in localization response
to fsk (Figure 5B–E, Figure S.6). These data demonstrate that overnight
application of fsk preferentially reduces surface levels of BKα.
We have not yet determined whether the observed effect is due to alterations
in endocytosis, degradation, or ER export. The effect of fsk apears
specific to FAP-BKα, and overnight incubation is not altering
global trafficking pathways reported by FAP-TM.

determined by (median MG-BTau)/(median MHN-Ester) for each sample.
Error bars are ±95% confidence intervals. Significance was determined
by Student’s t test with Welch’s correction.
Significant p-values are shown.

Conclusions
In this report, we have demonstrated GIRO
labeling, a two-color,
compartment selective FAP-based approach that generates distinct signals
from surface and internal proteins in live cells for simultaneous
detection. GIRO reliably and quantitatively measures changes in surface
and internal levels of target proteins with distinct advantages compared
to immunofluorescence including speed, capacity for high throughput,
use in live cells, and fixed binding stoichiometry. The availability
of cell-permeable and impermeable variants of MHN and MG dyes (Figure S.3) allow a variety of pulse-chase experiments
to distinguish endocytic, exocytic, and internal resident cargoes.45 The FAP is genetically encoded analogously to
other fusion tags or proteins, but the modular nature of the FAP–dye
interaction also enables the use of physiological sensors by changing
the applied dye.46

We identified
a PM half-life for BKα in the tens of hours,
demonstrating that GIRO labeling can be applied to quantitate changes
in protein surface expression. The intrinsic stability of BKα
at the cell surface is likely to vary among splicing isoforms and
be influenced by the incorporation of certain β subunits which
contain their own endocytic and trafficking signals.18−21 This imaging platform can be used with fluorescence microscopy to
identify cellular locations where BKα surface residence is high,
or where BKα is retained inside the cell, even in positions
juxtaposed to the membrane which would be optically indistinguishable
from PM. HEK293 cells are nonpolarized and not known to express BKα
or β subunits, and while BKα is sufficient to assemble
into a functional tetrameric channel, it is unknown whether β-subunit
lacking BK channels are commonly found in cells. Future studies aim
to address the roles of β subunits and alternative splicing
in modifying BK channel trafficking, and their roles in BK channel
localization to the cell surface and in PM microdomains.

Methods
Synthesis of
Dyes
MG-BTau was prepared as described
previously.38 Synthesis of MHN-Ester is
schematized in Figure 1D and described in detail, along with spectroscopic and biochemical
properties and methods in Supporting Information.

DNA Constructs
Murine BKα ZERO (MDAL start and
EMVYR end, accession# NM_010610.2) was cloned previously.20 FAP-BKα was generated by addition of FAP
to the N-terminus. A murine Igκ signal sequence was added to
the N-terminus to ensure proper membrane orientation, addition of
such a signal sequence has previously been shown to not adversely
affect BKα topology.47 FAP-BKα
was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 using EcoRI and BamHI sites for generation of stable cells (see Supporting Information). FAP-TM was generated
by the addition of a PDGFR1 transmembrane domain to dL5** in a pBabe
backbone.

Cell Lines and Culture
HEK293 cells were maintained
in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. Stable HEK293 cells expressing FAP-BKα
were generated by transfection of PacI linearized
pcDNA3.1 encoding FAP-BKα. Cells were selected for 1 week with
1 μg/mL G418. Selected cells were subjected to two rounds of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) after labeling with cell-permeant
MG-Ester. Single cells were sorted into wells of a 96-well plate to
generate clonal lines. Clones were identified by MG-ester fluorescence,
and two clones with different expression levels were selected for
use in experiments; these clones had distinct baseline GIRO profiles
(Figure S.7A). Polyclonal cells stably
expressing FAP-TM were generated by transfection of FAP-TM and selection
with 2 μg/mL puromycin. The dynamin 1/2 inhibitor dynasore,
the ER-Golgi trafficking inhibitor brefeldin A, and adenylyl cyclase
activator forskolin were acquired from Cayman Chemical Corp (Ann Arbor,
Michigan). Dynasore was prepared as a 50 mM stock in DMSO and aliquotted.
Brefeldin A was prepared as a 5 mM stock in DMSO, Forskolin was prepared
as 50 mM stock in DMSO. Cells were deprived of serum for 2 h before
dynasore treatment. Cells were treated with inhibitors for the indicated
times (1–18 h), with equivalent volumes of DMSO as vehicle
control.

Immunofluorescence
Antibodies against the HA epitope
were acquired from Abcam (clone HA.C5, www.abcam.com, Cambridge,
MA), Anti-BKα (clone L6/60) monoclonal antibodies were acquired
from NeuroMab (http://neuromab.ucdavis.edu/). Anti-HA was
used for surface/total labeling of FAP-BKα due to the ectofacial
HA epitope. Cells were seeded on 25 mm coverslips (Corning). Cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, www.emsdiasum.com) for 10 min and washed twice in PBS. Cells
were permeabilized as needed with 0.5% Triton-X for 5 min; blocking
was done by adding PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 20 min.
Anti-HA antibody was applied at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room
temperature. Anti-BKα antibody was applied at a dilution of
1:250–1:500 for 4 h at room temperature. After primary antibody
incubation, coverslips were washed three times with PBS. Alexa 568
or Alexa 488 conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was applied
at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. For surface and total
labeling against HA, this process was done once with permeabilization
omitted, then repeated with permeabilization and a different color
secondary. Coverslips were mounted onto slides using a homemade poly(vinyl
alcohol)-based mounting media. HA slides were imaged on a Nikon spinning
disk confocal microscope (Andor Technologies) using a 40× Nikon
Plan Fluor objective (NA 1.30) with oil immersion, BKα immunostained
slides were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510 using a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar
40× objective (NA 1.30).

Live Cell Imaging
Live cells were seeded in 35 mm glass-bottom
dishes (MatTek corporation). Prior to imaging, media was switched
to Fluorobrite DMEM (Life Technologies). Images were acquired prior
to dye addition to assess cellular autofluorescence. MG-BTau was added
directly to cell media to a final concentration of 300 nM. After 5
min, MHN-Ester was added to the cellular media to a final concentration
of 300 nM. Cells were imaged using a Nikon spinning disk confocal
microscope (Andor Technology) using a Zeiss Plan Fluor objective (NA
1.30) with oil immersion.

Quantification of Localization
Profile
plots were drawn
from the center of the nucleus to the PM of fixed and live cells along
the longest axis in order to include perinuclear and endoplasmic reticulum
staining (n = 25 cells from 3 experiments for each
condition). Nuclear center was identified in fixed cells by Hoechst
staining and in live cells by BKα nuclear exclusion. Pixel values
were measured using ImageJ (NIH). Profile plots were processed using
a custom Python script in which distance was normalized by aggregating
mean pixel values into 40 distance bins.

Flow Cytometry and RSE
Measurement
Cells were grown
and treated with drugs in 12-well plates (Greiner). Adherent cells
were labeled at room temperature for 5 min by addition of MG-BTau
directly to cell media to a concentration of 300 nM. After the 5 min
incubation, all media was aspirated and cells were moved to ice and
detached using cold PBS containing 4 mM EDTA. Single-cell suspensions
were generated by vigorous pipetting and cells were moved to round-bottom
96-well plates (Greiner) for flow cytometry. MHN-Ester was added to
all wells to a final concentration of 300 nM 5 min prior to flow cytometry
initiation. Live cells were analyzed using an Accuri C6 cell analyzer
with Intellicyte plate sampler attachment. Populations for analysis
were selected by forward and side scatter; MG-BTau fluorescence (FL4-A
channel, 640 nm excitation, 675/30 nm emission filter) and MHN-Ester
fluorescence (FL1-A channel, 488 nm excitation, 525/15 nm emission
filter) values were collected and analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo LLC).
RSE was determined by (Median MG-BTau)/(Median MHN-Ester). Due to
potential variability in instrument sensitivity from day to day as
well as differences expression between clones, all experiments were
normalized to contemporaneous vehicle controls. Data from clones were
thus normalized and pooled, as both clones responded similarly to
drug treatments (Figure S7.B). This particular
protocol was chosen for ease of labeling surface proteins without
removing drug treatments; however, similar results were obtained if
cells were detached and suspended, followed by sequential addition
of dyes prior to analysis without any washing steps. This may not
hold true for more rapidly recycling proteins.

Measurement of Dye Activation
Rate in Cells
Dye activation
was measured using flow cytometry. Cells were prepared by detachment
with cold PBS containing 8 mM EDTA and moved to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge
tubes. Flow cytometry was initiated at a flow rate of 40 μL/min.
After 1 min of run, a 10× concentrate of the requisite dye was
added during continuous sampling to produce the 300 μM final
concentration. Events were discretized into 0.1-s time bins, each
bin containing 100–200 cells. Mean fluorescence intensities
per time bin were quantified using Python 3.2. Nearest neighbor smoothing
was performed using GraphPad Prism (20 neighbors on each side to obtain
a 4 s moving average, second-order polynomial fit) to generate plots
of mean cell fluorescence vs time.
