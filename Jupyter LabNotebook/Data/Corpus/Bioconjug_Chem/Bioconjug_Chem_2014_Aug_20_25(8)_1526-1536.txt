Introduction
Over the past few decades, MRI has become
one of the most powerful
diagnostic tools available in both clinical and research settings.
It can provide noninvasive, multidimensional visualization of the
entire body with high spatial resolution. However, compared to other molecular imaging modalities, MRI has
relatively poor sensitivity, and therefore contrast agents (CAs) are
often used to enhance imaging contrast between pathological and normal
tissues. Currently, more than 40% of clinical MRI protocols include
the use of CAs.

Gd-based CAs are
able to shorten the longitudinal relaxation time
(T1) of water protons to produce “positive”
(bright) contrast and are most commonly used in MRI diagnosis. However,
current clinically used CAs possess relatively low contrast efficacy
(relaxivity, r1), and large amounts of
CAs have to be administered to achieve sufficient contrast, which
is often a safety concern. In addition, they are generally nonspecific
and not capable of sensing biochemical activity. As a result, the design of molecular probes with higher
relaxivity is crucial for MR molecular imaging. “Smart”
or “activatable” MR probes are particularly attractive
because they modulate their MR properties (relaxivity) leading to
signal amplification upon molecule target interaction.− These smart probes can greatly improve MR detection of specific
molecular events arising from either receptor binding (i.e., RIME,
receptor-induced magnetization enhancement)− or molecular
activation (i.e., pH, light, metal ions, and enzymes).− A number of environmentally responsive MRI probes− capable of specifically reporting on their local physiological or
biochemical conditions (e.g., pH, redox, ions) have been actively
explored, providing wide applications in diagnosis.

Thiol redox
chemistry is central to the control of cell fate and
is associated with various abnormal biochemical processes. Alternations in the levels of thiol-containing
biomolecules (biothiols), including glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys),
and homocysteine (Hcy), are directly linked with many diseases (e.g.,
cancer, AIDS, liver damage, psoriasis, and Alzheimer’s disease). Therefore, various methods for monitoring of
their levels have been developed, including thiol-sensitive organic
optical probes,− inorganic quantum dots, and luminescent semiconductors. Recently,
a few thiol-responsive Gd-based MRI probes have also been reported.− These probes typically have a small value of r1 relaxivity (2.77 mM–1 s–1) or show a decrease in r1 relaxivity after thiol-activation that leads to a darker
contrast.,, Here we report
MR probes that give an increasing, high value (&gt;10 mM–1 s–1) of r1 relaxivity
upon biothiol activation, resulting in a brighter contrast.

We have previously described an activatable Gd-based CA containing
a disulfide that undergoes reduction-triggered polymerization and
self-assembly to generate enhanced r1 relaxivity
after activation, by taking advantage of the increased molecular tumbling
time (τR) arising from in situ self-assembly of GdNPs. The mechanism of polymerization is based on
the reduction-triggered disulfide cleavage to yield 1,2-aminothiol,
which further condenses with 2-cyanobenzothiazole (CBT) in another
monomer to produce oligomers. A potential
limitation of this system is the competition from the reaction between
CBT in the monomer and the endogenous free cysteine―that stops
polymerization and self-assembly. On the other hand, the r1 relaxivity of the probe after reduction activation is
just ∼8.3 mM–1 s–1 (Table ), which is smaller than that of other reported
GdNPs-based CAs.− The lower r1 value is
presumably due to the flexibility of the linear oligomer of the scaffold
after polymerization. In order to effectively out-compete free cysteine,
we have optimized the self-assembly strategy by switching the concentration-dependent
intermolecular polymerization to concentration-independent intramolecular
macrocyclization chemistry, showing high efficacy to self-assemble
fluorescence, and PET probes into nanoparticles for imaging of enzyme activity in biological
systems. This optimized self-assembly system can also be applied to
develop the first example of caspase-3/7 activatable Gd-based MRI
probe by introducing a Gd-DOTA amide chelate. The r1 relaxivity following activation
is ∼15.6 mM–1 s–1 per molecule
at 1.5 T, which is around 2-fold higher than that of polymerization-based
probe 1a (∼8.3 mM–1 s–1). This suggests that, with the replacement of the flexible linear
oligomer with a macrocyclic scaffold after activation, the CAs with
more hydrophobic and rigid macrocyclic scaffold can further enhance
the r1 relaxivity following activation
according to the Slomon-Bloembergen-Morgan (SBM) theory. To further investigate the capability of the
macrocyclization chemistry mediated self-assembly approach for activatable
MRI probes with improved MR properties, we develop new redox activated
CAs containing two Gd-DOTA amide chelates and a biothiol sensitive
disulfide bond. The newly designed CAs upon reduction activation have
high r1 relaxivities per molecule (up
to ∼34.2 mM–1 s–1 at 0.5
T) and are specific to biothiols and capable of detecting GSH concentration
with high sensitivity.

Results and Discussion
Design of Redox Activated
Gd-Based CAs
The conceptual
design in Figure  was demonstrated with a
biocompatiable intramolecular macrocyclization system derived from
reaction between 2-cyano-6-hydroxyquinoline (CHQ) and free cysteine. Macrocycles are an important class of molecules
which exhibit profound chemical and biological properties derived
from the preorganized ring structures. In comparison to their acyclic analogues, macrocycles inherently
possess a lower number of rotatable bonds, and are more conformationally
restricted. Topologically, macrocycles also have larger surface areas., All these characteristics make macrocycles attractive scaffolds
for drug and material design. For example, well-defined macrocycles
can assemble to robust organic nanotubes or supramolecular barrels driven by noncovalent interactions. We envisioned that if two Gd-chelates were simultaneously
incorporated into the acyclic precursor (1), the increasing
number of Gd-chelates can result in a higher value of MR relaxivity
upon formation of Gd-based macrocycle (3). Furthermore,
the self-assembled GdNPs from these macrocycles will further increase
τR to amplify the r1 relaxivity
compared to that of the acyclic precursor (small molecule) with an
identical Gd concentration.,

General design of redox
activated MRI probe. (A) Illustration of
reduction-controlled macrocyclization and self-assembly for redox
activated MRI probe. An acyclic precursor 1 containing
two Gd-chelates is reduced to form reactive intermediate 2, which subsequently undergoes intramolecular cyclization to generate
a more rigid and hydrophobic macrocyclic product 3. The
following self-assembly of 3 into GdNPs generates increased r1 relaxivities and brighter MRI contrast. (B)
The chemical structure of probe 1 and the proposed chemical
conversions following disulfide reduction.

To prove this concept, we designed probe 1 containing
a disulfide that could be activated by reduction (Figure ). The application of thiol/disulfide redox couple
is well explored for biothiol sensing.− The established chemical reaction is highly biocompatible, ensuring
sufficient reaction to form more rigid and hydrophobic macrocycles
and effectively self-assemble into GdNPs. The introduction of two
Gd-DOTA amide chelates to the same molecule should increase the accumulation
of Gd3+ ions in the GdNPs to further enhance r1 relaxivity of the activation product.−

Synthesis and
Characterization of Gd-based CAs
The
general synthesis of probe 1 is shown in Scheme , which afforded two isomers (1-I and 1-II) with a ratio of 1:2 on HPLC. Both isomers showed the
same UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra (), and HRMS characterization
gave the same molecular weight ( Figure S1). 2-D NMR spectroscopy revealed an identical NMR pattern
of the precursors (11-I and 11-II) of both
isomers. Interestingly, both isomers can undergo spontaneous structural
isomerization to each other. When diastereomerically pure 1-I and 1-II were incubated in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at r.t.,
they could gradually isomerize and the ratio of 1-I and 1-II in both solutions stabilized at around 2 after 60 h based
on the HPLC analysis (Figure A and B). We
estimated the isomerization rate constants of 1-I and 1-II at the first 25 h of incubation (Figure C and D). The pseudo-first-order rate constants are 0.0133
h–1 for 1-I and 0.0296 h–1 for 1-II. These results demonstrate that isomer 1-I is thermodynamically more stable than 1-II in PBS buffer, and the kinetics of transforming 1-I to 1-II is about 2-fold slower than that of transforming 1-II to 1-I. Furthermore, the spontaneous isomerization
of 1-I and 1-II in solution is pH-dependent
(see ).
A much slower isomerization process was observed in aqueous solution
with a lower pH value (&lt;5.5). Since the chiral center at the C-4
position of thiazoline (4-(S) or 4-(R)) is reported to easily racemize/epimerize via a proposed keto–enol
tautomerism process under basic condition (), the same
mechanism is likely responsible for the epimerization of 1-I and 1-II. Indeed, the enolization-based racemization
of l-luciferin has been proposed for the biosynthesis of
firefly d-luciferin. Based on
the structure of precursor 11-II, which contains a 4-(S) chiral center at the thiazoline linker, we therefore
assigned isomer 1-II the same 4-(S)
chirality as that of 11-II, and 1-I the
4-(R) configuration (Scheme ). To further verify this assumption, we used MnO2 to
oxidize thiazoline to eliminate the chiral center at C-4 position
(Scheme ). As expected, both isomers 1-I and 1-II were converted to the same oxidation
compound 1-O that contains a thiazole linker, with an
identical peak on HPLC analysis. 1-O was stable in PBS
buffer without any isomerization.

Spontaneous
isomerization of 1-I and 1-II in PBS solution.
(A) Isomer 1-I (100 μM) is slowly
converted to 1-II, and gives rise to a final ratio of
∼2:1 (1-I: 1-II) after 60 h incubation
at r.t. (B) Isomer 1-II (100 μM) is slowly converted
to 1-I, and gives rise to a final ratio of ∼2:1
(1-I: 1-II) after 72 h incubation at r.t.
(C, D) Plots of the HPLC data estimate the pseudo-first-order rate
constant for isomerization of 1-I (C) and 1-II (D) at the first 25 h incubation time (1-I: k1 = 0.0133 h–1; 1-II: k1 = 0.0296 h–1).

To evaluate whether disulfide
reduction of probe 1 could trigger intramolecular cyclization,
isomer 1-I was treated with reducing agent TCEP at pH
3 to afford reduced intermediate 2-I (Figure A). Subsequent adjustment
of pH value to 7.4 resulted in intramolecular cyclization to give
two macrocyclic isomers 3-I and 3-II as
observed before (). The ratio of 3-I to 3-II is about 7:1 based on the HPLC analysis. Similarly,
treatment of 1-II with TCEP followed by adjustment of
pH value to 7.4 provided the same macrocyclic products 3-I and 3-II but at a ratio of 1:4 (Figure B). This difference may arise from different chirality at
the C-4 position of thiazoline linker in 1-I and 1-II and their different epimerization rates. Macrocyclization
of 1-O provided just one product 3-O based
on HPLC analysis (Figure C). Furthermore,
incubation of 1-I, 1-II, and 1-O in lysates of human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 gave the
same macrocyclic products as those in the buffer (Figure D). Similar results were obtained when incubating 1-I and 1-II in HeLa cell lysates (). These results
suggest that the reduction-triggered macrocyclization of our designed
probes can take place efficiently in a complex cellular environment.

Nanocharacterization of
Self-Assembled GdNPs
We further
confirmed the formation of GdNPs after macrocyclization of probe 1 upon reduction. DLS showed the particles with a mean diameter
of 100–300 nm from both isomers 1-I and 1-II upon TCEP reduction in water at pH 7.4 (). SEM (Figure A and B) and TEM (Figure C) images
revealed the shapes of separated GdNPs with diameters ranging from
100 nm to a few hundred nanometers. The presence of Gd in the particles
was confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy (). The formation
of nanoparticles from the macrocyclic products of 1-O was also observed based on the DLS analysis ().

Characterization of MR
Properties
Water proton relaxivities
for isomers 1-I and 1-II and the oxidized 1-O before and after disulfide reduction were measured on
0.5, 1.5, and 3 T clinical MRI scanners (). The relaxivity values of all these
probes were summarized in Table . Before disulfide
reduction, all the three di-Gd-chelate based CAs exhibited higher
relaxivity per molecule at all three magnetic field strengths compared
to single-Gd chelate containing agents such as Dotarem or our previously
reported probe 1a. The larger r1 relaxivities are in line with their larger
molecular size and also more Gd-chelates in the probes. Upon disulfide reduction, they all produced
enhanced relaxivities, which resulted in a 1.5-, 1.6-, and 1.4-fold
increase in r1 for 1-I, 1-II, and 1-O at 0.5 T, respectively. These results
indicate that, after macrocyclization, the relaxivities are further
enhanced owing to the formation of GdNPs. When measured at a higher
field strength (1.5 T), similar increases in r1 were also observed for 1-I (1.4-fold), 1-II (1.5-fold), and 1-O (1.4-fold), and even
at 3T, more than 1.2-fold increase in r1 was observed for 1-II. Among all three probes, 1-O gave the highest r1 values
per molecule upon activation at all three field strengths: 34.2 (0.5
T), 31.8 (1.5 T), and 21.0 mM–1 s–1 (3 T). The value of 1-O at 1.5 T is ∼8 times greater than that of Dotarem
and ∼4 times greater than that of our previous probe 1a upon activation (Table ), which demonstrates
that the self-assembly of CAs with more Gd chelates can effectively
increase the r1 relaxivity.

T1-weighted
MR images of a series of
solutions containing Dotarem, 1-I, 1-II,
and 1-O in PBS buffer were obtained at 0.5 T (Figure ) using a fast spin–echo pulse sequence with
TE = 19 ms and TR = 117 ms. As expected, the solution of di-Gd probes 1-I, 1-II, and 1-O are clearly brighter than
that of Dotarem at the same Gd concentration (800 μM). Moreover, upon
disulfide reduction, the solutions containing di-Gd probes in PBS
buffer exhibited much higher signal intensity than those before
reduction. These results confirm that higher r1 associated with the self-assembled GdNPs can result in faster T1 relaxation, leading to a significant enhancement
in MR contrast.

The images were acquired at a 0.5 T MR scanner (Signa HDx, GE Healthcare,
Waukesha, Wisconsin) at 37 °C, using a fast spin–echo
pulse sequence (TE/TR = 19/117 ms).

MR Detection of Reducing Environment
We first evaluated
the capability for MR detection of GSH levels by measuring the T1 value of representative probe 1-II solution (200 μM) upon incubation with varying concentrations
of GSH (0–10 mM) in PBS buffer at 0.5 T. As shown in Figure A, the T1 value of the
solution reduced gradually as the GSH concentration was increased.
At GSH concentration as low as 10 μM, a significant reduction
in T1 value (ΔT1 = −17 ± 4 ms) was observed for 1-II, and at ≥1 mM GSH, 1-II was extensively activated
in solution after 6 h, leading to the maximum reduction in T1 value (ΔT1 = −74 ± 5 ms). A plot of the change of relaxation rate
(Δ(1/T1)) in solution shows a GSH
level-dependent increase of relaxation rate for 1-II (Figure B). These results indicate that 1-II has a good sensitivity for MR detection of GSH levels. Since the
GSH is present at millimolar levels in cells, the sensitivity of 1-II is sufficient for MR detection of cellular reducing environment.

The selectivity of our CAs for biothiols against other representative
natural amino acids was next examined according to T1 value measurement (Figure C).
GSH, Cys, and Hcy, the three major biothiols, all caused remarkable
reduction in the T1 value like TCEP. No apparent response to other amino acids including
sulfur-containing methionine was observed in the test system. The response to Cys
is of importance, suggesting that 1-II can efficiently
outcompete free endogenous Cys in biological samples for macrocyclization.
As shown in Figure C, the incubation of 1-II (200 μM) in healthy HeLa cell lysates resulted
in a similar T1 value (T1 = 178 ± 4 ms) as that observed with GSH (1 mM) activation
in PBS buffer, which was inhibited by a thiol scavenger, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Therefore, 1-II was specific to biothiols over other analytes existing
in cells.

of relaxation rate (Δ(1/T1)) calculated

GSH. (C) T1 values (0.5 T) of 1-II (200 μM) in PBS buffer (10×, pH 7.4) following incubation

biothiols (GSH, Cys, and Hcy) and representative natural amino acids
(Gly, Glu, Lys, His, Met, Ser, Phe) were used for the studies. HeLa
cell lysates (10 million cells per mL PBS buffer) with or without
2 mM NEM pretreatment were studied. T1 value (0.5 T) for each solution was measured with Bruker Minispec
(mq20 NMR analyzer) at 37 °C, using the standard inversion recovery
program. Data represent mean values ± standard deviation; n = 4.

Since our probe will
produce an enhanced MR contrast upon reductive
activation, it would be more suitable for detection of pathology associated
with higher cellular GSH levels as compared with normal tissues such
as malignant and drug resistant tumors. In cells with oxidative stress that have lower GSH levels (e.g,
Parkinson’s disease), our approach
would result in a decrease in the MR contrast relative to healthy
cells; in this case, other previously reported MRI probes that show
a decrease in the r1 relaxivity after
thiol-activation,, may be applied in order to generate a positively increased contrast. One potential limitation of our current MRI probe
is its irreversibility after activation, and in the future a reversible
MRI probe may be designed to image the dynamics of the cellular reducing
environment if assembled nanoparticles can be disassembled and then
reassembled.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
described the development of novel redox activated
Gd-based CAs using an optimized macrocyclization chemistry-mediated
self-assembly approach. These CAs can be activated by disulfide reduction
to form rigid and hydrophobic macrocycles, which can further assemble
into GdNPs, resulting in enhanced relaxivity (∼60% amplified
at 0.5 T). The developed CAs containing two Gd-chelates exhibit a
high value of r1 (up to 34.2 mM–1 s–1 per molecule at 0.5 T) upon activation, and
also show high specificity and sensitivity to biothiols with MR detection,
indicating a feasible approach for sensing a reducing environment.

Experimental
Procedures
Materials and Methods
All chemicals were purchased
from commercial sources (such as Aldrich, Fluka, Anaspec, and Novabiochem).
Analytical TLC was performed with 0.25 mm silica gel 60F plates with
fluorescent indicator (254 nm). Plates were visualized by ultraviolet
light. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were taken
on a Bruker 400 MHz magnetic resonance spectrometer. Data for 1H NMR spectra are reported as follows: chemical shifts are
reported as δ in units of parts per million (ppm) relative to
chloroform-d (δ 7.26, s); multiplicities are reported as follows:
s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), dd (doublet of
doublets), m (multiplet), or br (broadened); coupling constants are
reported as a J value in Hertz (Hz); the number of
protons (n) for a given resonance is indicated nH, and based on the spectral integration values. Matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses were performed at the Mass Spectrometry
Facility of Stanford University. Higher-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) was performed on a Dionex HPLC System (Dionex Corporation)
equipped with a GP50 gradient pump and an inline diode array UV–vis
detector. A reversed-phase C18 (Phenomenax, 5 μm, 10 ×
250 mm or Dionex, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) column was used with
a MeCN (B)/H2O (A) gradient mobile phase containing 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a flow of 1 or 3 mL/min for the analysis.
Scan electron microscope (SEM) micrographs were obtained on a FEI
Nova NanoSEM microscope. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs
were obtained on a JEM 1230 Electron Microscope. Dynamic light scattering
(DLS) experiment was operated on a 90 plus particle size analyzer
(Brookhaven Instruments Corporation). Inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement was conducted on Nu Plasma Attom
equipment.

Synthesis of Gd3+ Probes 1 and 1-O (Scheme )
Synthesis
of Intermediate 5
Isobutyl chloroformate
(i-BuO-COCl) (156 μL, 1.3 mmol) was added to
a solution of Nα-Boc-Nε-Fmoc-l-Lys-OH (515 mg, 1.1 mmol) and N-methylmorpholine (NMM) (143 μL, 1.3 mmol) in dry
tetrahydrofuran (THF) (5.0 mL) at 0 °C under Ar. After 10 min,
the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature (r.t.), and kept
stirring at r.t. for 4–5 h. A solution of 2-cyano-6-amino benzothiazole
(NH2-CBT) (175 mg, 1.0 mmol) in dry THF (2.0 mL) was then
added dropwise to the reaction mixture at 0 °C. After further
reaction at r.t. overnight, the solvent was removed under vacuum.
The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (50 mL) and washed
with water (2 × 10 mL) and brine (10 mL). The organic layer was
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and EtOAc was removed
under vacuum. The residue was
purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane:EtOAc = 1.5:1) to give
a white solid in 72% yield, which was directly dissolved in dry dichloromethane
(DCM) (8 mL). Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (2 mL) was then added to
remove the Boc group. After removal of TFA under vacuum, the residue
was dissolved in dry THF (15 mL), to which S-Trt-N-Boc-d-Cys-OH (1.05 equiv), O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate
(HBTU, 1.1 equiv), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine

Synthesis of Intermediate 11 (11-I and 11-II)
Compound 10 was treated
with a solution of TFA/DCM/TIPSH (95/2.5/2.5, 5 mL) to remove all
of the protected groups. After stirring at r.t. for 3 h, the solvent
was removed under vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in MeOH (5

added, and the mixture was stirred at r.t. for another 1 h. After
removal of MeOH under vacuum, cold Et2O was added. The
precipitate was collected by centrifugation, followed by HPLC purification
to give 11-II in 79% yield. In order to obtain 11-I for NMR analysis, we further incubated 11-II in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) under Ar at r.t. for additional 24 h to isomerize 11-II to 11-I. 11-I was obtained

MR Measurement of r1 Relaxivity
A series of solutions containing 1-I, 1-II, or 1-O at five different
concentrations (0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mM) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) were incubated with or
without 2 mM TCEP at r.t. overnight. Then, the solutions were placed
in 250 μL Eppendorf tubes, bundled together, and MR imaged at
0.5, 1.5, and 3T (Signa HDx, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wisconsin) at
37 °C. The scanning procedure began with a localizer and then
consisted of a series of inversion-prepared fast spin–echo
scans, identical in all aspects (TR 4000 ms, TE minimum, BW 15.6 kHz,
field of view 6 cm, slice thickness 3 mm, matrix 128 × 128, NEX
1) except for the inversion time (TI) which was varied as follows:
4000, 2400, 1000, 800, 600, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50 ms. This scanning
procedure produced enough data to fit quantitative T1 relaxation values to each voxel in the image. For quantitative
data analysis, the acquired MR images were transferred as DICOM images
to an offline workstation, and signal intensities were extracted from
each of the 5 samples at each of the 10 TI times by manual region
of interest (ROI) placement and voxel averaging within the ROI.

Signal intensity versus TI relationships were fit to the following
exponential T1 recovery model by nonlinear
least-squares regression: SI (TI) = S0 [1–2 × exp(−TI/T1) + exp(−TR/T1)]. Relaxation rates
(R1) were determined as 1/T1. Longitudinal relaxivities (r1, units of mM–1 s–1) were calculated
as the slope of R1 vs [Gd] after the determination
of true Gd concentration of each sample by the ICP-MS measurement.

MR Detection of GSH Concentration
1-II (200
μM) in PBS buffer (10×) was incubated with various
concentration of GSH (0, 1, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500 μM, and 1
and 10 mM) at 37 °C overnight. After incubation, the solutions
were transferred into NMR tubes (5 mm O.D.), and the T1 value for each incubation solution was acquired at 0.5
T with Bruker Minispec (mq20 NMR analyzer) at 37 °C, using the
standard inversion recovery program.

Cell Culture
HeLa
human cervix adenocarcinoma epithelial
cells and MDA-MB-468 human breast adenocarcinoma epithelial cells
from American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS, GIBCO), 100 U mL–1 penicillin, and 100 μg
mL–1 streptomycin (GIBCO).

Incubation of 1-I, 1-II, and 1-O in Cell Lysates
The culture medium for adherent
MDA-MB-468 (or HeLa) cells was carefully removed and the cells were
washed with cold PBS buffer twice. RIPA (RadioImmuno Precipitation
Assay) buffer was added to cells using 1 mL of buffer per 5 million
cells. Then the cells were kept on ice for 1 h. The cell lysates were
gathered, centrifuged at 14 000 × g for
15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of the cell lysate was collected
and incubated with each probe (100 μM) at r.t. overnight, and
then injected into an HPLC system for analysis.

MR Detection
of Reducing Environment in Cell Lysates with 1-II
Cultured HeLa cells were trypsinized, washed,
and centrifuged to form cell pellets. PBS buffer (10×) was added
to the cell pellets using 1 mL of buffer per 10 million cells. The
cells were lysed with three repeated cycles of freezing and thawing
procedure. The cell lysates were then gathered, centrifuged at 14 000
× g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant
of the cell lysate was collected and incubated with 1-II (200 μM) at 37 °C overnight. For the inhibition experiment,
the collected cell lysates were incubated with 2 mM N-ethylmaleimide at r.t. for 30 min. 1-II was added at
a final concentration of 200 μM, and the solution was incubated
at 37 °C overnight. After incubation, the solutions were transferred
into NMR tubes (5 mm O.D.), and the T1 value for each incubation solution was acquired at 0.5 T with Bruker
Minispec (mq20 NMR analyzer) at 37 °C, using the standard inversion
recovery program.
