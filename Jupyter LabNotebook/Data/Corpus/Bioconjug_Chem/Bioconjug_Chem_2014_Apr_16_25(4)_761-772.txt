Introduction
The integrin αvβ3 receptor has
been widely studied due to its major role in tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis, and osteoclast mediated bone resorption. DOTA conjugated cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)
peptides have been synthesized as molecular imaging agents of integrin
αvβ3 expression, and several research groups have reported multimeric cyclo(RGDfK)
imaging probes with higher tumor uptake and improved pharmacokinetic
profiles. “Click chemistry”
utilizing the reactions of organic azides and terminal alkynes to
form 1,2,3-triazoles by Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions
catalyzed by Cu (I) provides an attractive
route for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals, especially those
utilizing biomolecules due to its bioorthogonal nature. There are
quite a few examples demonstrating the application of “click
chemistry” in radiopharmaceuticals, e.g., 18F-labeled
RGD peptides,111In-DOTA-conjugated
octreotide,99mTc-galacto-RGD
dimer peptide, or 64Cu(68Ga)-DOTA-conjugated RGD peptides, and so forth. We have developed a multifunctional triazine-based
scaffold as a toolkit for producing targeted positron emission tomography
(PET) imaging probes with a variety of choices for receptor targeting
ligands and different nuclear or optical imaging groups. The main
goal of this study was to demonstrate the synthetic feasibility of
a triazine-based modular platform, in which the spacer core molecule
could be conveniently linked to targeting groups (multimeric or monomeric)
and bifunctional chelator labeled with radiometal using either “click
chemistry” or standard amidation reactions from an activated
NHS ester. The “mix and match” concept allows the rapid
synthesis of preclinical drug candidates for PET or optical imaging.

Herein, we successfully prepared the triazine-based spacer core,
in a stepwise manner under temperature-controlled or microwave conditions
with high synthetic yields. We selected the cyclo(RGDfK) peptide for
targeting integrin αvβ3 receptors
as a proof-of-principle demonstration. Radiolabeling with copper-64
was achieved on microfluidic chips with repeatable excellent radiolabeling
yields and high specific activity. We also evaluated in vitro receptor binding affinity and in vivo biodistribution.

Results
and Discussion
Chemistry
It has been recognized
that cyclo(-Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Val-) is a targeting peptide
for integrin αvβ3 receptors and
inhibits tumor angiogenesis. It was reported
that lysine (K) or glutamic
acid (E) could replace the valine (V) residue at the fifth position
without affecting the integrin binding affinity., Since the amino group on lysine amino acid could be easily modified,
we synthesized azido-functionalized cyclo(RGDfK) peptide starting
from Fmoc-Gly-2Cl-Trt resin using standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide
synthesis chemistry. Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(N3)-OH,
Fmoc-(D)Phe-OH, and Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH (3 equiv for each)
were coupled to the resin sequentially by using HBTU/DIPEA coupling
agents after deprotection of the Fmoc group from the C-terminus on
the resin using piperidine. After the synthesis of the linear peptide
on the peptide synthesizer, the desired cyclic peptide was synthesized
by following the cleavage, cyclization, and deprotection steps developed
by Dai et al. The overall yield from
the starting Fmoc-Gly-2Cl-Trt resin was 31% yield after purification
by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography.

The
use of a triazine molecule as a molecular core has been reported for
a dendrimer construct for viral transfection, drug delivery, antibody targeting, or gadolinium based MRI agents. Cyanuric chloride was used as a core molecule for sequential
modifications using reported temperature controlled methods. There are two routes to synthesize the trisubstituted
triazine spacers (8, 9) (Scheme ). The cyanuric chloride was first reacted with tert-butyl-(2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl)carbamate linker
(SI) at 0 °C to afford intermediate spacer 1 in
the presence of DIPEA in 78% yield. Spacer 1 then reacted
with 2-(2-(prop-2-ynyloxy)ethoxy)ethan-1-amine (SI) under microwave
irradiation at 140 °C to afford bis-PEG-alkyne-substituted triazine
spacer 2 in 82% yield. Mono-PEG-alkyne-substituted triazine
spacer 4 could be afforded with second substitution of
2-(2-(prop-2-ynyloxy)ethoxy)ethan-1-amine linker by heating at 55
°C in 93% yield. Spacer 4 then reacted with 2-ethoxylethylamine
to afford spacer 5 under microwave irradiation at 140
°C in 95% yield. The t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC)
protecting groups on both spacers 2 and 5 linker ends were removed by trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane
(v/v:1/1) solution at room temperature to afford pure amino-ended
PEG linker substituted triazine spacer which were functionalized with
one or two acetylene moieties (8, 9) in
ca. 90% yield after HPLC purification. An alternate route to synthesize
spacer 8, which avoids the deprotection step and tedious
HPLC purification, starts with the reaction of cyanuric trichloride
and 2-(2-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)ethoxy)ethan-1-amine (2.6 equiv) in the
presence of DIPEA (2 equiv) to afford the stable monochloro-bis-PEG-acetylene
substituted triazine spacer 3 in 90% yield. Spacer 3 reacts with large excess of 2,2′-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine)
(40 equiv) and DIPEA (20 equiv) in anhydrous acetonitrile to afford
pure triazine spacer 8 in 89% yield after flash chromatography
on silica gel. A similar method was applied to synthesize triazine
spacer 9 containing one acetylene moiety in three steps.
In summary, the construction of triazine spacer containing acetylene
and amino functionalities could be achieved in three or four steps
using amino-BOC protected PEG linker in 56–69% total yield.
Avoiding the use of a protection–deproctection strategy, the
total synthesis of the spacer molecule could be accomplished in two
or three steps of 80% total yield for spacer 8 containing
two acetylene moieties, or 64% total yield for spacer 9 containing one acetylene moiety.

Synthesis of Triazine Spacers 8 and 9
Triazine spacers 8 and 9 reacted
with
2.7 or 1.3 equiv azido-functionalized cyclo(RGDfK) peptide using “click
chemistry” in the presence of TBTA-Cu (I) catalyst complex
(13%) at 100 °C under microwave irradiation for 40–60
min (Scheme ). The bis or monocyclo(RGDfK)
conjugated triazine spacers 10 and 11 were
obtained in 90% and 79% yield after HPLC purification. Different solvent
systems for the reaction were attempted. The protic solvent combination
methanol:water (1:1) was found to have the best yield for the “click”
reaction under microwave irradiation. The peptide conjugates 10 and 11 reacted with DOTA-NHS ester in anhydrous
DMF in the presence of 6 equiv DIPEA to afford the final DOTA conjugated
bis- or mono- cyclo(RGDfK) peptides in ca. 45% yield after purification.
The DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) standard peptide was synthesized via common amidation reaction from DOTA-NHS ester
and amino-functionalized cyclo(RGDfK) peptide (). DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 peptide was synthesized from “click” reaction
between azido modified cyclo(RGDfK) and propargylamine, which was
followed by amidation reaction with DOTA-NHS ester.

Synthesis of DOTA
Conjugated cyclo(RGDfK) Peptides 13–15
The “click chemistry”
between the acetylene group(s)
of the core molecules and cyclo(RGDfK)-N3 was challenging.
First, we synthesized DOTA-conjugated triazine precursors 17 and 18 (Figure ) through amidation
reaction from activated DOTA-NHS ester and triazine spacer 8 and 9. Then, we were unable to obtain the “click”
product from free DOTA-conjugated triazine and cyclo(RGDfK)-N3 using TBTA-Cu (I) catalyst under various reaction conditions
such as microwave irradiation or heating at high temperature (e.g.,
100 °C) overnight. Subsequent investigation determined that TBTA-Cu
(I) was not stable in the presence of free DOTA, which would chelate
copper as a DOTA-Cu (II) complex. Starting from chelated DOTA-Cu (II)-conjugated
triazine spacer, the “click” reaction with cyclo(RGDfK)-N3 peptide was complete in 1 h under microwave irradiation at
100 °C with 100% conversion yield, while under conventional heating
at 80 °C for 18 h we only obtained 50% conversion yield (). Starting from the chelated
DOTA-Gd (III)-conjugated triazine spacer, the product could be obtained
under microwave irradiation at 100 °C for 1 h with ca. 30% conversion
yield. The chelated Cu (II) would decrease the Cu (II)–Cu (I)
redox couple efficiency to generate active Cu (I) catalyst. As a result, there is insufficient Cu (I) to
serve as catalyst for the click reaction.

DOTA conjugated triazine spacers 17 and 18.

These results implied that free
DOTA was more likely to access
copper to form DOTA-Cu (II) complex than TBTA ligand (TBTA-Cu (I)
complex). To further validate the process, we performed a DOTA-TBTA
competitive chelation study using carrier-added 64Cu. Equal
moles DOTA-tetra-carboxylic acid and TBTA-64Cu (carrier
added) were mixed for 15 min at ambient temperature. We observed that
DOTA-64Cu (II) was produced from TBTA-64Cu (I)
in 100% yield after 15 min, as determined by radio-TLC (). Since DOTA could quench
the copper catalyst during the “click” reaction and
the chelated DOTA-Cu (II) would also decrease the radiolabeling yield
in a later step, the synthesis of cyclo(RGDfK)-“click”-triazine
process was performed prior to the DOTA conjugation reaction via amidation.
The “click” reaction could be catalyzed with 13% copper(I)-TBTA
complex under microwave irradiation at 100 °C for 40 min to afford
NH2-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 11 in 79% yield. NH2-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 10 containing two cyclo(RGDfK)
peptides was easily synthesized under the same microwave conditions
for 60 min in 90% yield. When using
conventional heating conditions, extended reaction time was needed.
Only monocyclo(RGDfK) conjugated triazine spacer was observed
from MALDI-TOF spectroscopy after the reaction of spacer 8 and cyclo(RGDfK)-N3 peptide under conventional heating
at 80 °C for 18 h. No bis-cyclo(RGDfK)-conjugated triazine was
observed even after 42 h in the presence of 25% Cu (I)-TBTA catalyst
complex. Thus, microwave heating was found to be the preferred method
to synthesize the “click” peptide product, especially
the bis-peptide conjugated compound. The “click” reaction
could be monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy at 1084.6 m/z (11, [M]+) or 1768.9 (10, [M+H]+). Both the
“click” product and the DOTA conjugate could be purified
with HPLC on reverse phase (C18) column in reasonable yields.

Conventional
and Microfluidic Radiolabeling on Chip
The microfluidic radiolabeling
of DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 containing two cyclo(RGDfK)
motifs was achieved with ligand
to metal ratios of 2–7 for each reaction (Table ). The ligand concentration was 4.5 μM and total mass
of the ligand was 0.5 μg. The radiolabeling process was performed
on chip at 37 °C for 10 min. The radiolabeling yield was &gt;97%
evaluated by radio-HPLC. The specific activity ranged from 850.9 ±
84.9 to 867.1 ± 88 Ci/mmol (n = 4 or 5). The
conventional radiolabeling was performed under normally reported condition., The reaction scale was about 3.7 μg peptide per mCi 64Cu in 200 μL buffer solution (NaOAc, 0.1 N, pH = 6.8). The
reaction was heated at 90 °C for 30 min to obtain 64Cu-labeled peptide with 99% radiolabeling yield. The specific activity
was 535.5 Ci/mmol.

Microfluidic radiolabeling was achieved on PDMS/glass
radiolabeling
chips. Ligand to metal ratio (2–7) was calculated based on
the estimated specific activity of copper-64 production, which differed
from batch to batch. Normally, the products from the first two runs
of labeling reaction on microchip were discarded in order to establish
the optimal labeling condition. After that, four to five repeated
runs could be performed with consistent radiolabeling yields (&gt;95%).
The product was collected in an Eppendorf tube and examined by radio-HPLC.
The delivered activity of the product was observed to drop with decreasing
radiolabeling yields due to increased dose absorbed into the PDMS
material. As expected, we observed about 45% retention of 64Cu on the microchip after the experiment, which was consistent with
our previous reports.

Overall, the
microfluidic radiolabeling has several advantages
over conventional radiolabeling method: (a) microfluidic radiolabeling
enables better handling of small reagent volumes (e.g., 4.5 μM/50
μL); (b) microfluidic radiolabeling requires a much lower ligand
to metal ratio (2–7 vs 60), and only one-seventh of the ligand
mass used in conventional labeling for each run (0.5 vs 3.7 μg),
which greatly reduces the expensive cost of biomolecules such as peptides
or antibodies; (c) it could achieve higher specific activity with
above 95% labeling yields (ca. 850 vs 600 Ci/mmol); (d) it could perform
reliable batchwise reactions with repeatable results (n = 4 or 5); (e) it provides efficient mixing by serpentine mixing
channel which improves the reaction kinetics to shorten the reaction
time (e.g., 10 min); (f) it provides fine control over reaction conditions
due to automated control; (g) it requires a much smaller overall footprint
of the system which minimizes the amount of space requiring shielding.

In Vitro Study
The cell binding study was performed
using I125-Echistatin binding assay. The
results indicated that addition of the DOTA chelator, triazole moiety
from “click” reaction, and triazine spacer into the
molecule decreased the cyclo(RGDfK) binding affinity to αvβ3 integrin receptors by increments of ca.
100 nM of IC50 value for each compound (Figures ). The IC50 values were 421.9 ±
90.9, 509.7 ± 203.3, and 637.6 ± 113.5 nM for compounds
DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK), DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15, and DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14, respectively, while plain
cyclo(RGDfK) has IC50 value of 111.1 nM (data not shown).

(inverted pyramid), 64Cu-DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK)
(diamond), 64Cu-DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) (triangle), and 64Cu-DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) (square).

The DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 conjugated with
two
cyclo(RGDfK) peptides had the strongest binding affinity to the integrin
αvβ3 receptors among this series
of compounds with IC50 value of 178.5 ± 57.1 nM. The
low IC50 value of DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 might be due to the bivalency effect of the compound, compared to DOTA-TZ-monocyclo(RGDfK). It had
significantly increased integrin αVβ3 binding affinity, similar to the reported HYNIC-dimer (112 ±
21 nM), and FPTA-RGD2 which contains
two cyclo(RGDfK) peptide and one triazole moiety (144 ± 6.5 nM).

Serum Stability Study
Both triazine-based
compounds
conjugated with one or two cyclo(RGDfK) peptides showed higher stability
than DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) or DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 in rat serum. Compound DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 was observed to be stable in rat serum for the first 24 h, and then
the stability decreased significantly to ca. 55% at 48 h (Figure ). Compound DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 was stable for the first 4 h (&gt;90%), and then the percentage
intact
decreased to 60% over the next 44 h. Compounds DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) and
DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 demonstrated
lower stability than the triazine-based conjugates in rat serum. The
DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 conjugate
had slightly lower stability than DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 for the first 4 h, and then it turned out to be unchanged for the
next 44 h (76%). DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) conjugate showed the lowest serum
stability, but nevertheless very close to the behavior of DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 in rat serum. Serum stability study showed that triazine-based
compounds containing both triazole and triazine aromatic moieties
were fairly stable in the rat serum environment for at least 4 h,
then the stability dropped over time. These expected phenomena might
be due to the transchelation challenge from copper-binding biomolecules
present in the extracellular and intracellular environments.

Biodistribution Study and Structure–Activity
Evaluation
All four peptide conjugates had higher tumor uptake
at 4 h than
that at 1 h on homozygous Nu/Nu female athymic nude mice implanted
with 5 × 106 U87MG cells. Compound DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 had the highest tumor uptake among these four at 4 h p.i.
with 1.90 ± 0.65%ID/g, followed by DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) 1.65 ±
0.40%ID/g, DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 1.15 ± 0.10%ID/g,
and DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 0.86 ± 0.17%ID/g (Figure ). The insertion of a triazole moiety made DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 have higher specific targeting, also increased uptake in
liver, kidney, and pancreas compared to DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) (Figure ). We observed that DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 had lower liver, kidney, and pancreas uptake than DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK)
at all time points studied. It can be inferred that the triazine moiety
in DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 did not increase the nontumor
organ uptake, although it had the lowest tumor uptake among these
four. The liver washout of DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 was
faster than DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15: the prior compound had decreasing liver uptake after 1 h p.i.,
while the latter one had highest liver uptake at 4 h p.i. This was
consistent with the measured logD values: DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK)
peptide (logD −3.3) had the highest lipophilicity
among this series of peptide conjugates ( Table S2), which increased the overall hepatic
uptake and hepatobiliary excretion of the peptide conjugate or its
radiocatabolites by specific biochemical pathway. DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 (logD −4.1) displayed a similar trend of organ uptake over time
to DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 (logD −3.6).
However, contrary to our expectations, DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 had significantly increased liver uptake (e.g., 15.86 ±
2.71%ID/g at 1 h p.i.), and slightly increased kidney and pancreas
uptake compared to DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) (logD −4.3).
A simple lipophilicity argument is obviously unable to explain this
observation. The high liver uptake is similar to that observed with
many RGD targeted nanoparticles and could be indicative of RES involvement
perhaps through a specific bivalent binding to Kupffer cells; the
monomeric RGD compounds are of much lower affinity and do not display
this high uptake. Shuhendler et al. postulated that such an effect
could explain the high liver uptake of RGD targeted nanoparticles.

For the design of triazine-based
cyclo(RGDfK) dimer conjugate,
the two peptide motifs are separated by 22 bonds, which should be
capable of binding two integrin αvβ3 receptors simultaneously. However,
we were surprised to observe only a 20% increase of tumor uptake for
dimer conjugate compared to the monomeric peptide conjugate based
on triazine core at 1 h p.i. (0.81 ± 0.12 vs 0.67 ± 0.21)
and 34% increase at 4 h p.i. (1.15 ± 0.10 vs 0.86 ± 0.17).
We did not observe a clear bivalency effect for DOTA-TZ-BisRGD in
the biodistribution study, although the in vitro study
found a 3.6-fold enhancement of binding affinity on U87MG human glioblastoma
cell. The observed bivalency effect shown in vitro was probably due to the high density of the integrin αvβ3 receptors on the glioblastoma tumor whole
cell in vitro. A partial blocking effect was observed
in the tumor with coinjection with unlabeled cyclo(RGDfK) (20 mg/kg
body weight). The coinjected cold peptide blocked 41.7% tumor uptake
of 64Cu-DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) which was radiolabeled by
conventional method (0.35 ± 0.04%ID/g) and blocked 36.2% tumor
uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13, which was radiolabeled by microfluidic method (0.63 ± 0.16%ID/g).

Interestingly, DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 conjugate had
the highest tumor to bone uptake ratio at all time points studied:
1.1 at 1 h p.i., 2.1 at 4 h p.i., and 3.5 at 24 h p.i. among all four
compounds ( Figure
S3). Tumor to muscle uptake ratios for all four compounds were in
the range of 2.3–3.0 at 1 h p.i. DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) had the
highest tumor/muscle uptake ratio as 6.1 at 4 h p.i. For the comparison
of tumor to blood uptake ratio, DOTA-“click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 had highest value as 2.8 at 1 h p.i., while DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK)
had the highest value as 5.3 at 4 h p.i. DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 had the lowest tumor/nontumor uptake ratio among these
four compounds, probably due to unexpected low tumor uptake. DOTA-“click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 and DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 conjugates had
rapid liver clearance for the first 4 h after the injection of 64Cu labeled conjugates, while DOTA-cyclo(RGDfK) and DOTA-TZ-cyclo(RGDfK) 14 conjugates had slow liver clearance for the first 4 h ( Figure S5). All the monomeric
peptide conjugates had fast kidney clearance for the first 4 h, and
then the uptake level became steady over next 20 h. Spacer linkers
have been reported to play an important role in reducing nonspecific
targeting and consequently increase the tumor/background ratio because
of their hydrophilicity, acidity, or basicity;, we did not observe significant advantages of short PEG linker (two
CH2CH2O moieties) in our study. Longer hydrophilic
PEG linkers might be a good choice in our case. Further studies are
ongoing to understand the excretion pathway of the triazine-based
conjugate and if any other factors play a role in the bivalency effect.

The 64Cu labeled conjugate using the microfluidic method
had moderately higher specific activity than that from using conventional
radiolabeling method (850.9 ± 84.9 to 867.1 ± 88.0 Ci/mmol
vs 535.5 to 612.5 Ci/mmol). The biodistribution results by injecting 64Cu-labeled DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 conjugate
demonstrated little differences in mice models using conventional
or microfluidic radiolabeling method ( Figure S4). It indicated that using microfluidic
radiolabeling method could achieve at least the similar effect to
conventional radiolabeling method while maintaining its intrinsic
advantages.

Conclusions
We have developed a
tool kit of triazine-based scaffold for diagnostic
imaging purposes. We have demonstrated the synthesis of triazine-based
monomeric and dimeric cyclo(RGDfK) peptide conjugates containing the
bifunctional chelator DOTA using “click chemistry”.
The methodology and techniques are versatile and provide a convenient
method to switch different functionalities, e.g., PET imaging, optical
imaging, targeting, or therapeutic group in the scaffold. In this
report, we used cyclo(RGDfK) specifically targeting integrin αvβ3 as proof of principle. A dimeric cyclo(RGDfK)
peptide was found to display significant bivalency effect in cellular
study. The peptide was radiolabeled with 64Cu using two
different methods, microfluidic on-chip radiolabeling and conventional
radiolabeling. The 64Cu-DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 using the microfluidic radiolabeling method had higher
specific activity than the one using the conventional radiolabeling
method. Biodistribution of all four conjugates in female athymic nude
mice were evaluated. DOTA-“Click”-cyclo(RGDfK) 15 had the highest tumor uptake among these four at 4 h p.i.
Further investigations need be done to re-evaluate the bivalency effect
for the dimeric peptide conjugate in vivo.

passively mixes reagents; (2) five incubation reservoirs for the radiometal–ligand
mixture; (3) a thin-film heater for heating the reaction mixture.
The fabrication of the chip was described in detail in our previous
publication.

Conventional and Microfluidic 64Cu2+ Radiolabeling
Conventional Radiolabeling
64CuCl2 in 0.1 M HCl was added to a sodium
acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.8).
DOTA conjugated cyclo(RGDfK) peptides (0.0017 μmol) were mixed
with 64Cu(OAc)2 stock solution (1 mCi) in sodium
acetate buffer solution (∼200 μL in total volume). The
reaction solution was incubated on a ThermoMixer (700 rpm) at 90 °C
for 30 min. No further purification was performed. The radiolabeling
yield was determined by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC (&gt;95%). The specific
activity of radiolabeled compounds was ca. 550 Ci/mmol.

Microfluidic
Radiolabeling
The radiometal, ligand,
and buffer solution were pumped into the microreactor through three
separate inlets. The solutions were mixed in the staggered herringbone
mixing channels by chaotic advection induced by the geometry of the
herringbones. The mixed reagents then
filled a series of hexagonal reservoirs and the reaction mixture was
incubated at a desired temperature for a specified time. The reaction
product was flushed out by injecting a sodium acetate buffer solution
(0.1 M, pH 6.8) into the microreactor. The syringe pumps were controlled
by a LabVIEW virtual instrument (VI). The flow rates, incubation time,
desired volume of the product (52.6 μL for the total volume
of the holding tanks), and the stoichiometric molar ratios of buffer,
radiometal, and ligand were controlled through the VI. A thin-film
heater was placed underneath the glass surface of the microreactor.
A temperature controller and a resistance temperature detector (RTD)
probe were used to maintain the temperature within ±1 °C
of the desired temperature. The radiometal syringe pump, heater, and
microreactor were shielded with lead shielding (2″ thick).
The syringes were connected to the reactor with Hamilton Luer Lock
30 gauge PTFE tubing of one foot length.

The PDMS/glass radiolabeling
chip was first washed with diluted nitric acid solution (1 N, 1 mL
× 3) at a flow rate 30 μL/min, to remove any metal ions
bound nonspecifically to the chip surfaces. Then the chip was washed
with water and sodium acetate buffer (0.1 N, pH 6.8) separately (1
mL × 3). All Hamilton glass syringes (250 and 500 μL) and
disposable plastic syringes (1 mL × 3) were rinsed with nitric
acid (1 N, 1 mL × 3), water, and sodium acetate buffer (0.1 N,
pH 6.8, 1 mL × 3) subsequently. 64Cu(OAc)2 solution (5 mCi, 250 μL), DOTA-TZ-Bis-cyclo(RGDfK) 13 peptide stock solution (13.5 μM, 250 μL), and sodium
acetate buffer (0.1 M, 1 mL) were loaded into syringes and installed
on the syringe pumps. The radiometal, ligand, and buffer solutions
were controlled to mix in the chip with different volume ratio using
LabVIEW interface software. The total volume was set to 52.6 μL
and the total flow rate was set to 25 μL/min. After each reaction,
three chip volumes of buffer solution were pumped into the chip to
wash the holding tanks thoroughly. The reaction temperature was set
to 37 °C and the residence time was set to 10 min. After collecting
the product, the activity was measured by dose calibrator (∼200
μCi, Capintec Inc. NJ), and the yield of radiolabeling reaction
was determined by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC. The first two on-chip
reactions were discarded in order to stabilize the chip condition.
Radiolabeling was repeated for 4–5 times under the same condition.
The radiolabeling yield was determined by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC
(&gt;97%). The specific activity of radiolabeled compounds was calculated
ca. 850 Ci/mmol.

Cell Culture and in Vitro Binding Assay
The in vitro cell binding
assay was performed with
U87MG human glioblastoma cell line. U87MG human glioblastoma cells
were grown in Dulbecco’s medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS). The affinities of cyclo(RGDfK) conjugates
for αvβ3 integrin were examined
via competitive cell binding assay using 125I-echistatin as the integrin αvβ3-specific
radioligand. To determine the in vitro binding affinity
of cyclo(RGDfK) peptide conjugates, U87MG cells were harvested for
membrane preparations as previously described. Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce
Non-Reducing Agent Compatible Kit (Rockford, IL). Briefly, 25 μg
of membrane protein in 100 μL binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 5
mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 10 μg/mL leupeptin,
10 μg/mL pepstatin, 0.5 μg/mL aprotinin, and 200 μg/mL
bacitracin, pH 7.4) was applied to 0.1% polyethyleneimine-pretreated
wells of a 96-well Multiscreen Durapore filtration plate (Millipore
Corp., Bedford, MA) via vacuum manifold aspiration. The wells were
then washed three times with washing buffer (10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA,
5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA). Increasing concentrations of cyclo(RGDfK)
peptide (0–91 μM) were added in a volume of 10 μL
to triplicate wells. To each well, 0.279 kBq of 125I-Echistatin (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) in a volume of 100
μL was added. The plate was incubated at room temperature for
1 h, after which the wells were washed twice with washing buffer.
The membranes were dried, removed, and placed in separate tubes for
determination of bound radioactivity. The membrane-associated radioactivity
was determined using a Packard II γ counter (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA). The IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data
using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism Software (San Diego,
CA).

Octanol/Water Partition Coefficient
The octanol and
buffer solution (0.01 M ammonium acetate, pH 6.8) were mixed and saturated
for 1 d. The partition coefficients were determined by adding 8 μL
of 64Cu-labeled peptide conjugate (20 μCi) to a solution
containing 500 μL sat. octanol and 492 μL sat. buffer.
The mixed solutions were vortexed for 5 min, and then centrifuged
for 5 min at 3000 rpm. Aliquots (100 μL) of octanol and buffer
were removed, weighed, and counted by gamma counter. The partition
coefficient was calculated as a ratio of counts in the octanol fraction
of unit mass to counts in the buffer fraction of unit mass. The experiments
were performed in triplicate, and the average LogD value was reported.

Serum Stability Study
The in vitro serum stabilities of the 64Cu-cyclo(RGDfK)
conjugated
compounds were evaluated by incubation with freshly isolated lean
rat serum. Each 64Cu-radiolabeled cyclo(RGDfK) conjugated
compound (9 μM, 100 μCi) was mixed with rat serum (100
μL) in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. The reaction was incubated
on an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C (Hauppauge, NY) at 37 °C (300 rpm).
Aliquots were withdrawn at 0, 1, 4, 24, and 48 h, and evaluated by
radio-TLC on a BioScan AR-2000 Imaging Scanner (Washington, DC). The
radio-TLC was analyzed on reverse phase C18 silica plates using 1:1
methanol/5% ammonium formate. The reactions were repeated in triplicate.

Animal Model and Biodistribution Studies
Animal studies
were performed in accordance with the guidelines for the care and
use of research animals as defined by the Washington University Animal
Studies Committee. Homozygous Nu/Nu female athymic nude mice at 6–7
weeks of age were implanted subcutaneously on the rear flank with
5 × 106 U87MG cells in a volume of 100 μL saline.
Tumors were allowed to grow for 14 d, upon which the mice (n = 3) were injected intravenously with 10 μCi of
respective 64Cu-labeled cyclo(RGDfK) peptide conjugates.
One group was coinjected with 350 μg of cold cyclo(RGDfK) peptide
to do the blocking study. Mice were sacrificed at 1 and 4 h post injection.
Blood, lung, liver, kidney, muscle, bone, pancreas, and tumor were
collected for determination of tissue-associated radioactivity. Counts
were obtained using a γ-counter. The percent injected dose per
gram (%ID/g) for each tissue was calculated to normalization from
a standard dose.
