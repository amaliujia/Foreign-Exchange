Introduction
The pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a
major xenobiotic receptor that regulates the metabolism and excretion
of xenobiotics and endobiotics by regulating the expression of drug-metabolizing
enzymes and drug transporters., Expression of a PXR
target gene is regulated by the binding of PXR to the promoter region
of the target gene, such as cytochrome P450 3A4, a critical enzyme
in the metabolism of more than 50% of all clinically prescribed drugs. By affecting drug metabolism and distribution,
changes in PXR activity can influence the therapeutic and toxicological
response to drugs and potentially cause adverse drug–drug interactions.,

PXR activity is mainly regulated by direct ligand binding
(and
the unique structure of PXR allows many drugs and drug leads to bind
to it), although it can also be regulated
by various cell signaling pathways. Radioligand-binding
assays, in the format of scintillation proximity assays, were initially
used to investigate direct binding of PXR to ligands such as 1 (TO901317),2 (NMTB), and 3 (SR12813)− (Figure ). When Invitrogen offered the LanthaScreen time-resolved
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) pregnane X competitive
binding assay kit containing the first PXR fluorescent probe (Fluormone
PXR (SXR) Green), it was quickly used in multiple studies.− However, this commercially available assay may not be optimal for
studying ligand–PXR interactions because the chemical structure
of Fluormone PXR (SXR) Green is proprietary information that is not
publicly disclosed and Fluormone PXR (SXR) Green is available only
as a component of the assay kit and at a prediluted concentration
of 4 μM in 50% methanol/water. Recently,
we have discovered 4 (BODIPY FL vinblastine) (Figure ) to be a potent PXR fluorescent probe and successfully
used it in a TR-FRET assay to evaluate the PXR-binding affinities
of a panel of putative PXR ligands: 1 (TO901317), 3 (SR12813), 5 (hyperforin), 6 (clotrimazole), 7 (rifampicin), 8 (ginkgolide A), and 9 (ginkgolide B) (Figure ).

It was speculated that the unique combination of 10 (vinblastine) (Figure ) and 11 (BODIPY FL propionic acid) (Figure ), which
forms BODIPY FL vinblastine, contributes to the high PXR-binding affinity
because 10 (vinblastine) itself has low PXR-specific
binding affinity and 11 (BODIPY FL propionic acid) has
no PXR-specific binding affinity by itself.

of vinblastine and BODIPY FL propionic acid.

To identify additional novel and potent PXR fluorescent probes
based on the high-affinity PXR probe BODIPY FL vinblastine, we first inspected the PXR-binding activities
of 10 (vinblastine), its close analogue 12 (deacetyl vinblastine), and its fragments 13 (catharanthine)
and 14 (vindoline), together with 15 (catharanthinic
acid) and 16 (deacetyl vindoline), which are the close
analogues of 13 and 14, respectively (Figure ). We then conjugated 15 (catharanthinic
acid) with 17 (BODIPY FL propionyl ethylenediamine, BODIPY
FL EDA) (Figure ) and 16 (deacetyl
vindoline) with 11 (BODIPY FL propionic acid) or 18 (Sulfo-Cy5 carboxylic acid) (Figure ) to obtain vinblastine fragment-based fluorescent molecules 19 (BODIPY FL catharanthine), 20 (BODIPY FL vindoline),
and 21 (sulfo-Cy5 vindoline) (Figure ). The results presented here indicate that 20 (BODIPY FL vindoline) is a potent PXR fluorescent probe, and the
newly developed PXR TR-FRET assay with 20 (BODIPY FL
vindoline) as a fluorescent probe is suitable for high-throughput
screening aimed at identifying PXR-binding ligands.

Results and Discussion
Syntheses of Fluorescent
Probes of 19 (BODIPY FL
Catharanthine), 20 (BODIPY FL Vindoline), and 21 (Sulfo-Cy5 Vindoline)
The syntheses of fluorescent probes
are summarized in Scheme  (19, BODIPY FL catharanthine), Scheme  (20, BODIPY FL vindoline), and Scheme  (21, sulfo-Cy5 vindoline). The typical reaction involved
in preparing these probes was an EDAC- and DMAP-mediated Mitsunobu
reaction between carboxylic acid and
primary amine in the synthesis of 19 (BODIPY FL catharanthine)
and between carboxylic acids and secondary alcohol in the syntheses
of 20 (BODIPY FL vindoline) and 21 (sulfo-Cy5
vindoline). In the preparation of 19 (BODIPY FL catharanthine), 15 (catharanthinic acid) was reacted with 17 (BODIPY
FL propionyl ethylenediamine hydrochloride) for 6 h at room temperature
and under nitrogen protection in the presence of EDAC, DMAP, and DIPEA
with methylene chloride as the solvent and provided a yield of 18%.
In the preparation of 20 (BODIPY FL vindoline), 16 (deacetyl vindoline) was reacted with 11 (BODIPY
FL propionic acid) for 5 h at room temperature and under nitrogen
protection in the presence of EDAC and DMAP with methylene chloride
as the solvent and provided a yield of 74%. In the preparation of 21 (sulfo-Cy5 vindoline), 16 (deacetyl vindoline)
was reacted with 18 (sulfo-Cy5 carboxylic acid) for 24
h at room temperature and under nitrogen protection in the presence
of EDAC and DMAP with DMF as the solvent and provided a yield of 68%.
In the preparation of 20 (BODIPY FL vindoline) and 21 (sulfo-Cy5 vindoline), the secondary hydroxyl group in
deacetyl vindoline (16) was esterified because this secondary
hydroxyl group has relatively higher reactivity than the other tertiary
hydroxyl group in the deacetyl vindoline (16) due to
less steric hindrance around the secondary hydroxyl group area. The
selective reactivity of esterification at the secondary hydroxyl group
in deacetyl vindoline (16) has been previously reported
in a similar DCC and DMAP-mediated coupling reaction.

Synthesis of Fluorescent Probe 19 (BODIPY
FL Catharanthine)
Synthesis of Fluorescent Probe 20 (BODIPY FL Vindoline)
Synthesis of Fluorescent Probe 21 (Sulfo-Cy5 Vindoline)
Evaluation of the hPXR-Binding Activities of Vinblastine (10), Deacetyl Vinblastine (12), Catharanthine
(13), Catharanthinic Acid (15), Vindoline
(14), and Deacetyl Vindoline (16)
To investigate which portion of BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) is responsible for its high PXR-binding affinity, we determined
the competitive binding activities of vinblastine (10), its fragments catharanthine (13) and vindoline (14), and their respective close analogues deacetyl vinblastine
(12), catharanthinic acid (15), and deacetyl
vindoline (16) in the BODIPY FL vinblastine (4)-based PXR TR-FRET binding assay, using TO901317 (1, 10 μM, 100% inhibition) and DMSO (0% inhibition) as positive
and negative controls, respectively; the use of TO901317 (1, 10 μM) and DMSO as controls as well as the probe concentration
of BODIPY FL vinblastine (100 nM) in the TR-FRET assay was previously
described. The fluorophore portion of
BODIPY FL vinblastine, the BODIPY FL propionic acid (11), was not included in the test because it does not have any specific
PXR-binding affinity. The TR-FRET signals
for each individual test condition were normalized to those of positive
(100% inhibition) and negative (0% inhibition) controls and presented
as the percent inhibition, with representative results summarized
in Figure A and Table . Among vinblastine (10) and its fragments catharanthine
(13) and vindoline (14), vindoline (14) displays the strongest competitive binding activity, inhibiting
the binding of BODIPY FL vinblastine to PXR by 93% at 100 μM.
By contrast, vinblastine (10) and catharanthine (13) have inhibitory activities of only 60 and 73%, respectively,
at 100 μM. However, deacetyl vinblastine (12),
catharanthinic acid (15), and deacetyl vindoline (16), which are the respective close and more-hydrophilic analogues
of vinblastine (10), catharanthine (13),
and vindoline (14), display less PXR-binding inhibitory
activity (40, 44, and 73%, respectively) than do their corresponding
parental analogues (60, 73, and 93%, respectively) at 100 μM.
As shown in Figure A, the competitive binding
activity of all compounds tested is dose-dependent. These results
suggest that the lipophilic modifications at respective positions
(4-acetylations in vinblastine and vindoline; 18-methylesteration
in catharanthine) are important to maintain high PXR-binding inhibitory
activity. The dose–response curves and activities of those
chemicals having a maximal percent inhibition greater than 50% are
summarized in Figure B and Table . Vindoline (14) has the highest PXR-binding
inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value of 12.9 μM.
Vinblastine (10) and catharanthine (13)
have IC50 values of 71.4 and 20.5 μM, respectively.
Among the respective close and more-hydrophilic analogues of vinblastine
(10), catharanthine (13) and vindoline (14) (deacetyl vinblastine (12), catharanthinic
acid (15), and deacetyl vindoline (16)),
only deacetyl vindoline (16) has a percent inhibition
greater than 50%, with an IC50 value of 41.4 μM.
The maximum inhibitory activities of deacetyl vinblastine (12) and catharanthinic acid (15) are less than 50%; therefore,
no IC50 value could be obtained. The positive control TO901317
(1) is a potent PXR binder with an IC50 value
of 304 nM.

The results
discussed above indicate that in the BODIPY FL vinblastine
(4)-based PXR TR-FRET binding assay, catharanthine (13) and vindoline (14), the two fragments of
vinblastine (10), have stronger PXR competitive binding
activities than does vinblastine (10). In addition, the
lipophilic modifications present in vinblastine (10),
catharanthine (13), and vindoline (14) enhance
their PXR-binding activities beyond those of the corresponding deacetyl
vinblastine (12), catharanthinic acid (15), and deacetyl vindoline (16). Similarly, modification
of deacetyl vinblastine (12) with the lipophilic BODIPY
FL propionic acid (11) generates BODIPY FL vinblastine
(4), a high-affinity PXR ligand with a Kd of 673 nM, as previously reported. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that
similar lipophilic modifications with the proper fluorescent moiety
at corresponding positions in catharanthinic acid (15) and especially deacetyl vindoline (16) might lead
to novel and high-affinity PXR fluorescent probes. We therefore designed
and synthesized BODIPY FL catharanthine (19), BODIPY
FL vindoline (20), and sulfo-Cy5 vindoline (21) (Schemes –) and evaluated their PXR-binding properties along with those of
BODIPY FL vinblastine (4).

BODIPY FL Vindoline (20) Binds to hPXR’s
Ligand-Binding Domain with High Affinity
BODIPY FL vinblastine
(4) and the newly synthesized fluorescent molecules BODIPY
FL catharanthine (19), BODIPY FL vindoline (20), and sulfo-Cy5 vindoline (21) were tested for their
hPXR binding affinities in an hPXR TR-FRET binding assay: the results
are summarized in Table  and in Figure A–D. In the PXR binding assays, titrations
of individual fluorescent molecules were incubated with 5 nM Tb-anti-GST
and 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD in the presence of either DMSO or TO901317 (1, 10 μM) (Figure A–D).
In addition, titrations of individual fluorescent molecules were incubated
with 5 nM Tb-anti-GST, 5 nM GST (instead of GST-hPXR-LBD), and DMSO
to serve as absolute background binding controls (Figure A–D). All assays were performed in laboratory
assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.05
mM DTT, pH 7.5). As expected, the absolute background binding of BODIPY
FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY FL vindoline (20) (GST instead of GST-hPXR-LBD was used) was very weak (Figure A,C). The background binding (i.e., binding to GST-hPXR-LBD
in the presence of TO901317 [1, 10 μM]) of BODIPY
FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY FL vindoline (20) was almost identical to the absolute background binding, indicating
that 10 μM PXR ligand TO901317 (1) effectively
inhibited the interactions between PXR and BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) or BODIPY FL vindoline (20). The total binding
of BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) was substantially stronger than were either the
background binding or absolute background binding (Figure A,C). The differences between total binding interaction
curves and absolute background binding curves defines the hPXR-specific
binding of BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) (Figure A,C). The Kd values, derived from the total
binding curves in Figure A,C were 297 and
256 nM for BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY FL vindoline
(20), respectively. In terms of individual Kd values of PXR binding, BODIPY FL vindoline (20, Kd of 256 nM) has a PXR binding affinity
similar to that of BODIPY FL vinblastine (4, Kd of 297 nM). However, BODIPY FL vindoline (20) displayed binding saturation at high concentrations (Figure C), which was not seen for high concentrations of
BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) (Figure A). In contrast to BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY
FL vindoline (20), BODIPY FL catharanthine (19) and sulfo-Cy5 vindoline (21) had no detectable PXR-mediated
specific binding affinity, as there was no difference among these
conjugates’ total binding, absolute background binding, and
background binding (Figure B,D).

concentrations of BODIPY FL vindoline (20) to either
5 nM Tb-anti-GST; 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD in the presence of either DMSO

binding); or to 5 nM Tb-anti-GST, 5 nM GST, and DMSO (absolute background
binding). (D) Binding curves of indicated concentrations of sulfo-Cy5
vindoline (21) to either 5 nM Tb-anti-GST; 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD
in the presence of either DMSO (total binding) or TO901317 (1, 10 μM, background binding or nonspecific binding);
or to 5 nM Tb-anti-GST, 5 nM GST, and DMSO (absolute background binding).

Both BODIPY FL vindoline (20) and BODIPY FL vinblastine
(4), which are the respective modifications of deacetyl
vindoline (16) and deacetyl vinblastine (12) with lipophilic BODIPY FL propionic acid (11) at the
4-position, are high-affinity PXR probes (Kd of 256 and 297 nM, respectively) (Table ). Both deacetyl vindoline (16) and deacetyl vinblastine
(12) are substantially weaker than BODIPY FL vinblastine
(Figure ). Similarly, 4-acetylation of deacetyl
vindoline (16) generates a more lipophilic vindoline
(14), which demonstrated a stronger PXR-binding inhibitory
activity [Ki of 36.0 μM for deacetyl
vindoline (16) and 11.2 μM for vindoline (14)] (Table ). There results indicate
that proper modifications of deacetyl vindoline (16)
enhance its PXR binding affinity. However, hydrophilic modification
of deacetyl vindoline (16) at its 4-position with sulfo-Cy5
carboxylic acid (18) led to sulfo-Cy5 vindoline (21), which displayed no specific PXR binding affinity. The
loss of specific PXR binding affinity was also observed in BODIPY
FL catharanthine (19), in which catharanthinic acid (15) is modified at its 18-position with BODIPY FL EDA (17); however, 18-methylesteration of catharanthinic acid (15) led to catharanthine (13) with improved PXR-binding
inhibitory activity (Figure ). Together these
results suggest that the binding affinity of a compound to PXR can
be differentially affected by different modifications.

In light
of the fact that BODIPY FL vinblastine (4, Kd of 297 nM) and BODIPY FL vindoline
(20, Kd of 256 nM) are higher-affinity
hPXR ligands than their corresponding precursors deacetyl vinblastine
(12) and deacetyl vindoline (16) and that
BODIPY FL propionic acid (11) itself is not an hPXR ligand, BODIPY FL vinblastine (4) and BODIPY
FL vindoline (20) should be considered to be unique chemical
entities in terms of their hPXR affinity.

Because higher PXR
binding affinity was observed for BODIPY FL
vinblastine (4) when PXR TR-FRET binding assays were
performed with the newly formulated and clearly defined laboratory
assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.05
mM DTT, pH 7.5) than with Invitrogen assay buffer, the components
of which are a trade secret and not disclosed (Kd of 297 and 673 nM,respectively),
we used only the newly formulated laboratory assay buffer in the hPXR
TR-FRET assays from here on.

Determination of the Optimal BODIPY FL Vindoline
(20) Concentration for the hPXR TR-FRET Assay
Our results so
far indicated that the newly developed BODIPY FL vindoline (20) is a high-affinity (Kd of
256 nM) PXR fluorescent probe. We next investigated the optimal BODIPY
FL vindoline (20) concentration for a BODIPY FL vindoline-based
PXR TR-FRET assay.

To avoid deviating from the Cheng–Prusoff
equation in any subsequent calculation of a compound’s Ki value, a concentration at or somewhat below
the Kd value of the probe should generally
be tested. Because the Kd value of BODIPY FL vindoline (20) is 256
nM, the four concentrations of BODIPY FL vindoline (20) tested were 250, 100, 50, and 25 nM (Figure A). Each probe concentration was tested under four different treatment
conditions to gain insight into the total binding of BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) to hPXR (DMSO group), the background binding of
BODIPY FL vindoline (20) to hPXR in the presence of TO901317
(1, 10 μM), the absolute background binding A (DMSO
in the absence of GST-hPXRLBD protein, but with the presence of GST),
and the absolute background binding B (DMSO in the absence of both
GST-hPXR-LBD and GST protein). Consistent with the data shown in Figure C, both total binding (DMSO group with GST-PXRLBD)
and background binding (10 μM TO901317 with GST-PXRLBD) increased
as the concentration of BODIPY FL vindoline (20) increased
from 25 to 250 nM (Figure A).

concentrations of BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) in the TR-FRET assay after 30 min of incubation
with 5 nM Tb-anti-GST and other indicated assay components. (A) Interaction
of BODIPY FL vindoline (20) with 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and
5 nM Tb-anti-GST in the presence of either DMSO or TO901317 (1, 10 μM); interaction of BODIPY FL vindoline (20) with 5 nM Tb-anti-GST and DMSO with or without 5 nM GST
(without GST-hPXR-LBD). (B) Signal-to-background ratio of BODIPY FL
vindoline (20) interaction with 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and
5 nM Tb-anti-GST, where signal and background are defined as 10 000
× 520 nm/490 nm ratios obtained from DMSO and TO901317 (1, 10 μM), respectively. For each BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) concentration tested in both panels A and B, the
difference between DMSO and TO901317 (1, 10 μM)
was substantial and statistically significant (p &lt;
0.0001).

To determine whether background
BODIPY FL vindoline (20) binding is mediated by hPXR,
we omitted hPXR protein from the assay.
In the absence of GST-hPXRLBD but with GST (absolute background binding
A; DMSO group in the absence of GST-hPXRLBD but with GST in Figure A), BODIPY FL vindoline (20) concentrations
of 25, 50, 100, and 250 nM corresponded to fluorescence emission ratios
of 484 ± 46, 446 ± 29, 446 ± 22, and 682 ± 26,
respectively, with ratio difference within the error range for BODIPY
FL vindoline (20) concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 nM,
suggesting that BODIPY FL vindoline (20) can bind weakly
to other components of the assay system, such as the Tb-anti-GST antibody
plus GST. The absolute background binding A of BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) was comparable to its background binding [in the
presence of GST-PXR-LBD protein and TO901317 (1, 10 μM)
(420, 460, 476, 777)] or its absolute background binding B [in the
absence of either GST-PXR-LBD or GST protein but with DMSO (449, 471,
462, 701)]. These results indicate that, although BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) can bind weakly and nonspecifically to components
of the assay system in an hPXR-independent manner, its binding to
hPXR is specific and substantially higher than the background binding.

The ratio of total binding signal (DMSO negative control group)
to background binding signal (10 μM TO901317 positive control
group) for BODIPY FL vindoline (20) concentrations of
25, 50, 100, and 250 nM was 3.4, 4.4, 7.0 and 4.7, respectively (Figure B). Because the TR-FRET assay is robust and radiometric,
all three signal-to-background ratios are suitable for a high-throughput
screening (HTS) assay. In fact, with the Invitrogen PXR TR-FRET kit,
HTS of 8280 chemicals was successfully accomplished, with signal-to-background
ratios ranging from 2.5 to only 3.5 and Z′-factor
&gt; 0.5. We chose 100 nM BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) for further experimentation because of their signal-to-background
ratio (the higher the better) and background binding (the lower the
better). However, assays with 50 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20) probe were also validated (data not shown), and it may be beneficial
to evaluate some lower-affinity PXR ligands (Figure B and Table ).

Signal from the BODIPY
FL Vindoline (20)-Based
hPXR TR-FRET Assay Is Stable
Signal stability is an important
parameter in a HTS assay. To assess the signal stability, we measured
the binding activity of 100 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20) with DMSO vehicle control or various concentrations of TO901317
(1) at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min in reactions
containing 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST. Both the total
binding (with DMSO vehicle control; 3446, 3406, 3321, 3226, 2963,
and 2733) and the background binding (with 10 μM TO901317; 487,
485, 473, 463, 502, and 520) were relatively stable (Figure A) for the corresponding 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and
240 min reaction times, with very stable signals at 120 min that slightly
decreased after 120 min. Correspondingly, the signal-to-background
ratios were also relatively stable, with a slightly decreasing trend
over time (Figure B).

values of the interaction of 100 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20) with 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST at the indicated time
points. The Z′-factor was calculated from
the total binding signal (DMSO) and background binding signal (10
μM TO901317) by using eq  (see  section). (D) TO901317 (1) dose–response curves in the presence of 100 nM BODIPY FL
vindoline (20), 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD, and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST
at the indicated time points. For each time point tested in both panels
A and B, the difference between DMSO and TO901317 (1,
10 μM) was substantial and statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001).

The Z′-factor remained constant over
the
entire testing period (Figure C). The IC50 values for TO901317 (1) were relatively stable
over the entire 240 min time course, with signals decreasing slightly
after 120 min incubations (Figure D). The
consistent Z′-factor values demonstrate that
the assay is very stable and is suitable for HTS. Although all incubation
times could be used for HTS, the signals and signal-to-background
ratios suggest an optimal incubation time of 120 min or less for the
BODIPY FL vindoline (20)-based hPXR TR-FRET assay. Because
a shorter incubation time contributes to higher throughput, a 30 min
incubation time was selected for further experiments.

(20)-Based hPXR TR-FRET Assay
Tolerates a Wide Range of DMSO Concentrations
DMSO tolerance
is another important assay parameter because DMSO is a solvent commonly
used for compounds in drug discovery. We used DMSO to dissolve all
of the compounds used in this study. In the DMSO tolerance test, the
TR-FRET signals from BODIPY FL vindoline (20)-based PXR
binding assays were collected after 30 min of incubation with either
DMSO vehicle control or various concentrations of TO901317 (1) in 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.1, 2, 5, or 10% final DMSO concentration
plus 100 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20), 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD,
and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST. The total binding signal (at 10 000 ×
520 nm:490 nm ratio) remained stable at 3404–3259 with DMSO
concentrations of 0.2 to 2% and then decreased to 2906 and 2033 when
the DMSO concentration was increased to 5 and 10%, respectively (Figure A). The background binding signal (in the presence
of 10 μM of TO901317) remained constant at 476–490 with
DMSO concentrations of 0.2 to 2% and then decreased slightly to 432
when the DMSO concentration was increased to 5 or 10% (Figure A). The signal-to-background ratio was also relatively
stable, ranging from 6.8 to 7.0 at DMSO concentrations at or below
5% and falling to 4.7 when the DMSO concentration was 10% (Figure B). In the TO901317 (1) competition
assay, the IC50 values of TO901317 (1) at
DMSO concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.1, 2, 5, and 10% remained constant
at 105.1, 103.3, 103.2, 100.2, 99.8, 111.7, and 108.4 nM, respectively
(Figure C), although there was a slight IC50 value increase and total signal decrease at lower TO901317
concentrations with DMSO concentration at 5 and 10%. These results
indicate that the BODIPY FL vindoline (20)-based PXR
TR-FRET assay can tolerate a wide range of DMSO concentrations up
to at least 2%. The typical DMSO concentration of 1.1% used in the
remainder of this report is within the assay’s DMSO tolerance
range.

at the indicated DMSO concentrations. For each DMSO concentration
tested in both panels A and B, the difference between DMSO and TO901317
(1, 10 μM) was substantial and statistically significant
(p &lt; 0.0001).

Binding Affinity of a Panel of hPXR Ligands in the BODIPY FL
Vindoline (20)-Based hPXR TR-FRET Assay
To further
validate and evaluate the BODIPY FL vindoline (20)-based
hPXR TR-FRET assay, we selected a panel of seven hPXR ligands: TO901317
(1), SR12813 (3), hyperforin (5), clotrimazole (6), rifampicin (7), ginkgolide
A (8), and ginkgolide B (9). The hPXR binding
activity values of all seven compounds with BODIPY FL vinblastine
(4) as the fluorescent probe have been reported. In the BODIPY FL vindoline (20)-based
PXR TR-FRET assay, TR-FRET signals were collected after a 30 min incubation
with serial dilutions of the seven hPXR ligands under study plus 100
nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20), 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD, and 5
nM Tb-anti-GST. The data were fit into a one-site competitive binding
equation to derive the dose–response curves (Figure A). TO901317 (1), SR12813 (3), hyperforin (5),
clotrimazole (6), rifampicin (7), ginkgolide
A (8), and ginkgolide B (9) had IC50 values of 101.6 nM, 166.7 nM, 543.5 nM, 4.2 μM, 27.2 μM,
37.7 μM, and 13.0 μM, respectively (Table ). As a side-by-side comparison, their PXR-inhibitory activities
were tested in 50 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20): IC50 values were 51.7 nM, 92.3 nM, 299.8 nM, 2.1 μM, 8.4
μM, 20.7 μM, and 10.4 μM, respectively (Figure B; Table ).

Dose–response
curves of a panel of hPXR ligands after 30
min of incubation in the presence of 100 nM (A) or 50 nM (B) BODIPY
FL vindoline (20), 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD, and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST.

The PXR inhibitory activities
of the seven ligands tested in this
article along with literature-reported activities are summarized in
Table . In general,
a lower probe concentration resulted in lower PXR inhibitory IC50 values, although the shapes of the curves were quite similar
regardless of probe concentrations. From this point, a lower BODIPY
FL vindoline (20) concentration (50 instead of 100 nM)
may be useful for evaluating relative lower-affinity PXR ligands and
calculating their IC50 values because more complete dose
curves may be obtained (when high drug concentrations are used). However,
compound solubility will limit the concentration range that can be
used. For example, ginkgolide B (9) has a more complete
dose–response curve with 50 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20) than with 100 nM, so the IC50 value of ginkgolide B
(9) from tests with 50 nM BODIPY FL vindoline (20) might be more reliable. When ligand inhibitory activities
obtained by using BODIPY FL vindoline (20) as the fluorescent
probe were compared to those obtained by using BODIPY FL vinblastine
(4) as the fluorescent probe, the general potency rank
order was maintained, with TO901317 (1), SR12813 (3), and hyperforin (5) in a high potency group,
clotrimazole (6) in a medium potency group, and rifampicin
(7), ginkgolide A (8), and ginkgolide B
(9) in a low potency group. The slight difference may
be due to the fact that PXR has a relatively large and flexible ligand-binding
pocket that can accommodate ligands of different sizes− and even a single ligand with different conformations. With PXR having a large and flexible ligand-binding
pocket, it may bind to BODIPY FL vindoline and BODIPY FL vinblastine
with different conformations, resulting in a slightly different ligand
potency rank order when different PXR fluorescent probes are used.

Co-crystal structures of hPXR and
its ligands TO901317 (1), SR12813 (3),, hyperforin (5), and rifampicin
(7) have been reported and
demonstrate that these ligands bind directly to the ligand-binding
pocket of PXR. The finding that PXR ligands TO901317 (1), SR12813 (3), hyperforin (5), and rifampicin
(7) can compete with the binding of BODIPY FL vindoline
(20) to PXR predicts that BODIPY FL vindoline (20) may bind directly to PXR at its ligand-binding pocket;
however, this prediction needs to be verified via a PXR- BODIPY FL
vindoline (20) co-crystal study.

In summary, we
have synthesized and demonstrated that BODIPY FL
vindoline (20) is a novel, high-affinity hPXR ligand.
BODIPY vindoline (20) is a unique chemical entity different
from its precursors, either vindoline (16) or the fluorophore
BODIPY FL propionic acid (11). The BODIPY FL vindoline
(20)-based hPXR TR-FRET assay has a high signal-to-background
ratio and high signal stability over time, both of which contribute
to high and consistent Z′-factor values; it
can also tolerate a wide range of DMSO concentrations. Taken together,
our results demonstrate that BODIPY FL vindoline (20)
binds specifically to hPXR and that the BODIPY FL vindoline (20)-based hPXR TR-FRET assay can be used to measure the binding
affinity of compounds to hPXR.

ethylenediamine hydrochloride were purchased from Setareh Biotech,
LLC (Eugene, OR). Sulfo-Cy5 carboxylic acid was obtained from Lumiprobe
Corporation (Hallandale Beach, FL). Catharanthinic acid and deacetyl
vindoline were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto,

LC/PDA/MS system with a C18 BEH, 1.7 μm column in a 15 min gradient
[(H2O + 10 mM NH4HCO3 → CH3OH for 19, BODIPY FL catharanthine) and (H2O + 0.1% formic acid → acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid
for 20, BODIPY FL vindoline and 21, sulfo-Cy5
vindoline)] and detectors of PDA (215–400 nm) and positive-mode
ESI-MS. High-resolution mass spectra were determined on a Waters Acquity
UPLC system with a C18 column (H2O + 0.1% formic acid →

General Biological Assay Procedure
All assays were
carried out in either 20 μL of TR-FRET PXR (SXR) assay buffer
with 0.05 mM DTT (Invitrogen buffer) or laboratory assay buffer (50
mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.05 mM DTT, pH 7.5)
with 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST at room temperature (approximately
25 °C) in 384-well black polypropylene plates unless specified
otherwise, and all assays were performed in triplicate. All chemicals
were solubilized in DMSO. The final DMSO concentration was 1.1% in
all assays, with the exception of the DMSO tolerance test, in which
DMSO concentrations are specified. In a typical assay, a chemical
(solubilized in DMSO) diluted in Invitrogen buffer or laboratory assay
buffer as a 2× working solution (containing 2% DMSO) was first
dispensed (10 μL/well) into a 384-well plate, followed by dispensing
of individual fluorescent probe solution (4× working solution
in Invitrogen buffer or laboratory assay buffer with 0.4% DMSO; 5
μL/well) and a mixture of 20 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 20 nM Tb-anti-GST
solution (prepared in Invitrogen buffer or laboratory assay buffer;
5 μL/well), unless specified otherwise. After mixing all assay
components by shaking them for 1 min on an IKA MTS 2/4 digital microtiter
plate shaker (IKA Works; Wilmington, NC, USA), the plates were briefly
centrifuged at 201g (1000 rpm) for 30 s in an Eppendorf
5810 centrifuge with an A-4-62 swing-bucket rotor (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg,
Germany). The typical assay incubation time was 30 min, with the exception
of the longitudinal signal stability assays, for which the incubation
time is specified. All assay data were generated by using a PHERAstar
FS plate reader (BMG Labtech; Durham, NC, USA) to measure fluorescent
signal followed by calculation of the fluorescence emission ratio
[10 000 × 520 nm/490 nm for BODIPY FL vinblastine (4), BODIPY FL catharanthine (19), and BODIPY
FL vindoline (20) and 10 000 × 665 nm/620
nm for sulfo-Cy5 vindoline (21) in the PXR binding assays]
of each well, using a 340 nm excitation filter, 100 μs delay
time, and 200 μs integration time. Raw data from the plate reader
were directly used for analysis unless specified otherwise. The graphic
software GraphPad Prism 5.04 (GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA, USA)
was used to generate graphs and curves and to determine Kd and IC50 values. The methods described here
were applied to all of the specific assays described below; additional
information is included in the description of each specific assay
where applicable.

were normalized to positive control (10 μM TO901317, 100% inhibition)
and negative control (DMSO, 0% inhibition) values, with eq  used to derive the percent inhibition of individual
chemicals at respective concentrations.Where applicable, the data were fit into a
one-site competitive binding equation to derive IC50 values.
The inhibition constant (Ki) value was
subsequently calculated by using eq .where IC50 is the concentration
of inhibitor that inhibits 50% of binding, [L] is the concentration
of BODIPY FL vinblastine (100 nM), and KL is the Kd value of BODIPY FL vinblastine
in the assay (673 nM). The Ki values were
used to compare the binding affinity of compounds to that of GST-hPXR-LBD.

Kd Determination of Fluorescent Probes
of 19 (BODIPY FL
Catharanthine), 20 (BODIPY FL Vindoline), and 21 (Sulfo-Cy5 Vindoline) in an hPXR TR-FRET Assay
Serial dilutions
of 19 (BODIPY FL catharanthine), 20 (BODIPY
FL vindoline), or 21 (sulfo-Cy5 vindoline) (20 μM
to 0.6 nM, 1:2 titration, 16 concentration levels) were incubated
with 5 nM Tb-anti-GST, 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD, and either 1.1% DMSO (vehicle)
or 1 (TO901317, 10 μM) (final DMSO concentration
was 1.1%). As an additional background control group, serial dilutions
of 19 (BODIPY FL catharanthine), 20 (BODIPY
FL vindoline), or 21 (sulfo-Cy5 vindoline) (20 μM
to 0.6 nM, 1:2 titration, 16 concentration levels) were incubated
with 5 nM Tb-anti-GST, 5 nM GST (without GST-hPXR-LBD), and 1.1% DMSO
(vehicle). All assays were performed in laboratory assay buffer (50
mM Tris, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.05 mM DTT, pH 7.5).
The signals of individual wells were collected after 30 min incubations.
The collected data (10 000 × 520 nm/490 nm) were fit into
a one-site total binding equation for the DMSO vehicle group, 10 μM
TO901317 group, and DMSO vehicle group (with GST and without GDT-PXR-LBD).
The individual equilibrium binding constant (Kd), if applicable, was derived from the DMSO vehicle group.

Optimization of Probe Concentration for 20 (BODIPY
FL Vindoline) in the hPXR TR-FRET Binding Assays
20 (BODIPY FL vindoline) (250, 100, 50, or 25 nM) was incubated with
5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST plus either DMSO (vehicle)
or 1 (TO901317, 10 μM) (final DMSO concentration
was 1.1%) in laboratory assay buffer for 30 min, and then TR-FRET
signals (10 000 × 520 nm/490 nm) were collected.

Determination
of Signal Stability for 20 (BODIPY
FL Vindoline) in the hPXR TR-FRET Assay
20 (BODIPY
FL vindoline, 100 nM) was incubated with 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 5 nM
Tb-anti-GST plus either DMSO, 1 (TO901317, 10 μM),
or serial dilutions of 1 (TO901317, 10 μM to 0.3
nM with 1-to-2 titration for 16 concentration levels) in laboratory
assay buffer, and TR-FRET signals (10 000 × 520 nm/490
nm) were collected after 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min. The final
DMSO concentration in all samples was 1.1%. To calculate the Z′-factor, 16 data points were included in both the
high-signal (DMSO, negative vehicle control to determine total binding)
and the low-signal (10 μM TO901317, positive control to determine
nonspecific binding) groups, and eq  was used.where
σ+ is the standard
deviation of the negative control (DMSO) group, σ– is the standard deviation of the positive control (10 μM TO901317)
group, mean+ is the mean of the negative control (DMSO)
group, and mean– is the mean of the positive control
(10 μM TO901317) group. The data from TO901317 titration were
fit into a one-site competition binding equation to derive IC50 values.

DMSO Tolerance Test for the 20 (BODIPY FL Vindoline)-Based
hPXR TR-FRET Assay
20 (BODIPY FL vindoline,
100 nM) was incubated with 5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST
plus either DMSO, 1 (TO901317, 10 μM), or serial
dilutions of 1 (TO901317, 10 μM to 0.3 nM, with
1-to-2 titration at 16 concentration levels) in laboratory assay buffer.
The final DMSO concentration was 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.1, 2, 5, or 10% in
each group. After a 30 min incubation, the TR-FRET signals (10 000
× 520 nm/490 nm) were collected. The data from titrated TO901317
were fit into a one-site competition binding equation to determine
the IC50 values.

the 20 (BODIPY FL Vindoline)-Based
hPXR TR-FRET Assay
Serial dilutions of 1 (TO901317), 3 (SR12813), 5 (hyperforin) (10 μM to 0.3
nM, with 1-to-2 titration at 16 concentration levels), 6 (clotrimazole), 7 (rifampicin), 8 (ginkgolide
A), 9 (ginkgolide B) (100 μM to 49 nM, with 1-to-2
titration at 12 concentration levels), DMSO, or 10 μM TO901317
were incubated with 100 nM 20 (BODIPY FL vindoline),
5 nM GST-hPXR-LBD, and 5 nM Tb-anti-GST for 30 min in laboratory assay
buffer before TR-FRET signals (10 000 × 520 nm/490 nm)
were collected. Where applicable, the data were fit into a one-site
competitive binding equation in a dose-dependent manner to derive
IC50 values.
