ABSTRACT
Stable, six coordinated Bu2SnLA type complexes have been prepared [where LH
RCOC:C(OH)N(C6Hs)N:CCH3; R =-4-F-C6H4-(LIH), R =-4-C1-C6H4-(L2H), R=-4-Br-C6H4-(L3H), R=
-CF3(LnH) and AH (O)C6H4C(O)CHR'COOH; R'= -H(AIH),-CH3(A2H),-CH(CH3)2(A3H)] by the
interaction of 1:1"1 molar ratios of di-n-butyltin(IV) dichloride with corresponding organic moieties in
refluxing benzene using two moles of Et3N as a base. In these complexes LH and AH behave as bidentate
and coordination is taking place through oxygen, this is inferred from IR and 3C NMR studies. These
complexes possess tin atoms in skew trapezoidal bipyramidal geometry with the C-Sn-C angles ranging from
149.88 to 156.84.Some of these complexes with their corresponding organic moieties (LH ,AH) were
tested for their antimicrobial activities.
Keywords- Di-n-butyltin(IV) dichloride, heterocyclic 13-diketones, N-phthaloyl amino acids, antimicrobial
testing, spectral studies, micro organisms.
INTRODUCTION
A large number of organotin(IV) complexes using a variety of organic ligands /1-6/ have been
synthesised and characterised in recent years due to their significant biological activities/7-9/. Some of these
derivatives have been tested for in vitro activity on different type of tumour cells/10-12/. They also possess
significant applications in different fields such as lubricating agents /13/, boat paint additives to prevent

attack by micro organisms/14/, catalysts/15,16/, polymers/17/and organic synthesis/18/. In continuation of
our work on mixed ligand dibutyltin(IV) and dicyclopentadienyltitanium(IV) complexes derived from
heterocyclic 13-diketones and N-phthaloyl amino acids/19,20/, now an attempt has been made to synthesise
mixed ligand dibutyltin(IV) complexes using different types of substituents on these organic moieties.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All experimental works were performed under a moisture free atmosphere. Chemicals and solvents used
were dried and purified by standard methods/21/. The substituted heterocyclic [3-diketones and N-phthaloyl
amino acids have been synthesised by the literature procedures/22,23/.
Synthesis of Bu2Sn[FC6H4COC:C(O)N(C6Hs)N:CCH3][O2CCH2NC(O)C6H4C(O)]
Benzene solution (30 ml) of (LH), 1-Phenyl-3-methyl-4-(4'-Fluorobenzoyl)-5-Pyrazolone (1.00 g, 3.4
mmol); (AIH), 1,3-dihydro-l,3-dioxo-2H-isoindole-2-acetic acid (0.69 g, 3.4 mmol) and Et3N (0.68 g, 6.8
mmol) were added dropwise to a benzene solution (30 ml) of di-n-butyltin(IV) dichloride (1.03 g, 3.4 mmol).
After refluxing this solution -,,8-10 h., the precipitated Et3N.HC1 was filtered off and the volatile components
of the filtrate were removed under reduced pressure to yield a coloured solid. All other derivatives were
synthesised by the same procedure and the preparative and analytical data are summarised in Table 1.
Analytical Methods and Spectral Measurements
IR Spectra were recorded (4000-200 cm) as KBr pellets on Nicolet Magna 550 spectrophotometer.
Microanalyses (C,H,N) were performed using a Perkin Elmer 2400 CHNS/O analyzer. H, 19F and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded in CDC13 and CHC13 solutions, respectively, on a JEOL FX-90 Q FT spectrometer.
lgsn NMR spectra were recorded in CHC13 solution. Melting points were determined in sealed capillaries.
Molecular weights were determined cryoscopically in benzene.
Antimicrobial Screening
Qualitative AntimicrobialAssay
The antimicrobial activities of LH,AH and their metal complexes were tested against six pathogenic
micro organisms (i) Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive bacteria), (ii) Streptococcus viridans (Gram
positive bacteria), (iii) Escherichia coli (Gram Negative bacteria), (iv) Fusarium oxysporium (Fungus), (v)
Alternaria alternata (Fungus), (vi) Alternaria solani (Fungus). The culture was maintained by the reported
procedure/24/. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was qualitatively determined by a modified disc
diffusion method/25/. A lawn of micro-organisms was prepared by pipetting and evenly spreading inoculum
(105-106 c.f.u./cm3) [c.f.u. colony forming units] onto agar set in Petri dishes, using nutrient agar (NA) for

bacteria. Whatman No. 1 filter paper discs of 6 mm diameter were impregnated with the stock solutions of
the complexes (100 mg cm-3) in DMSO and dried under sterile condition. The dried discs were then placed
on the previously inoculated agar surface. The plates were inverted and incubated for 24 h. at 30C.
Antimicrobial activity was indicated by the presence of clear inhibition zones around the discs.
Quantitative AntimicrobialAssay
Substances showing positive antimicrobial activity via the disc diffusion assay were subjected to the broth
dilution method for the quantitative measurement of microbiostatic (inhibitory) activity as described by
Hufford and Clark/26/. The lowest concentration that completely inhibited visible microbial growth was
recorded as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, tg cm3) of the species in DMSO. Both Nystatin
and Kanamycin were used as positive controls.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reactions of Bu2SnCI_ with heterocyclic 13-diketones (LH) (Fig. la), N-phthaloyl amino acids (AH)
(Fig. lb) and a base Et3N in 1:1:1:2 molar ratios in refluxing benzene solution afforded mixed ligand di-n-
butyltin(IV) complexes.

After filtering off the EhN.HC1 and stripping off the volatile fraction from filtrate, all these derivatives
were obtained as coloured solids. These derivatives were found to be soluble in common organic solvents
and were recrystallised from CHCl/Pet.-ether mixture. The plausible structures of these newly synthesised
mixed ligand complexes of di-n-butyltin(IV) have been proposed on the basis of spectral studies.
IR Spectra
A comparison of the IR spectra of these mixed ligand di-n-butyltin(IV) complexes has been found to be
helpful in providing structural assignments of the complexes, vOH absorption has been found to be absent in
the region 3400- 2600 cm,showing that both the organic moieties are bonded through deprotonated forms
which is supported by the presence of vSn-O vibrations in the region 650 + 60 cm
-/27,28/. A band
appearing at --,1760 cm due to vCO(asym) vibration in the spectra of N-phthaloyl amino acids (AH) does not
show any significant shift, suggesting the non-involvement of this group (imido CO) in bonding. A broad
band centered at ,--1702 cm
-in the IR spectra of AH may be assigned to [vCO(sym) + vCOO(asym)] vibrations
splits into two after complex formation. The sharp band at 1702 cm and a medium intensity band at 1640
1610 cm1
may be assigned to vCO(sym) and vCOO,ym) vibrations, respectively. The splitting of this band
into two indicates the bidentate behaviour of AH/29,30/. The values of Av[vCOO(asym)-vCOO(sym)] can be
calculated by the reported procedure/19/ and have been obtained in the range 215 230 cm", further
suggesting the chelating nature of carboxylate group of AH/31/.
vC=O stretching vibrations of heterocyclic [-diketones (LH) appear as a strong band in the region 1660
1600 cm" this band is shifted towards lower frequency of the order of-,-50-15 cm and may be assigned to
vC O vibration. This shifting of vCO band in 13-diketone moiety suggests the coordination through
carbonyl oxygen and its bidentate nature/27/. No significant shift in the positions of bands at ,--1570 and
1590 cm has been observed. These bands may be assigned to v(C=C C =N) and phenyl vibrations,
respectively. A medium intensity band in the region 610- 590 cm has been assigned to Sn-C vibration/32/.

The presence of only one Sn-C band indicates that the two butyl groups are in trans axial position/33/.
According to group theoretical predictions the trans- SNO4C2 system should exhibit one Sn-O and one Sn-
C vibration and the cis isomer two Sn-C and four Sn-O stretching vibrations in the IR spectra/34/(Fig. 2).
The appearance of one Sn-C and one Sn-O stretching vibration in the IR spectra of these mixed ligand di-n-
butyltin(IV) complexes suggests that two butyl groups are in trans configuration.
Fig. 2
H NMR Spectra
The H NMR spectra (Table 2) of these di-n-butyltin(IV) mixed ligand complexes show interaction of
both organic moieties towards central tin atom through deprotonated form as inferred from disappearance of
-OH signals. Aromatic protons appear as a multiplet in the region 5 7.02 8.46 ppm. The signals due to butyl
protons attached to tin exhibit a complex Pattern in the region 2.63 0.33 ppm for 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 and 12.
The :zJ(l19Sn-lH) coupling constant values in these derivatives could not be observed as signals due to methyl
groups of N-phthaloyl amino acids (except A1H) are merged with the signals due to butyl groups attached to
the central tin atom. In the derivatives derived from LH and AH (1,4,7), protons of butyl groups appear as
triplet at 5 0.75 -0.89 ppm and two multiplets at 5 1.28- 1.66 ppm, 5 1.23 1.98 ppm due to CH3 and CH2
groups, respectively. The 2j (119Sn. H).values of 93, 96 and 97 Hz observed for 1,4 and 7 are found to be very
close to the reported value (~ 101 Hz) for six coordinated diorganotin(IV) complexes/35,36/.
According to the literature, the use of the Lockhart-Manders equation/37/shown below
0 0.0161{2j(l19Sn-H)} 1.32{j(l9Sn-H)} + 133.4
yields C-Sn-C angles of 149.88,155.05 and 156.84 for 1,4 and 7, respectively, indicating the presence of
two butyl groups attached with tin atom in trans position with distorted octahedral (skew trapezoidal
bipyramidal) geometry/38/. Other tH NMR spectral data are summarised in Table 2.
3C NMR Spectra
3C NMR spectra of di-n-butyltin(IV) complexes have been recorded in CHCI. solution and are tabulated
as Table 3. A small shift has been noticed in the positions of C5 and COO carbons of LH and AH,

respectively. These results are in agreement with earlier reported values/24/suggesting the bidentate nature
of LH and AH moieties. Important information related to the structure of coordination polyhedra of di-n-
butyltin(IV) complexes can be obtained from the values of the coupling constants J(l19Sn-13C), because they
are directly linked to the size of C-Sn-C angle (0). ij (119Sn.3C) coupling constant value found for 1 is 780
Hz, which supports the six coordination number for the central tin atom/39/. On the basis of the equation
given by Holocek and Lycka/40/, the C-Sn-C angle in is estimated to ca. 152.75.1J 9.990 746
This indicates that the two butyl groups occupy the trans position in the octahedral geometry /41/. An
identical value of 0 has been reported by Kepert /42/ suggesting the skew trapezoidal bipyramidal geometry.
The Ij (Sn-C) coupling constant values could not be observed for other complexes due to the low intensity of
Bu-Sn carbon resonances which resulted in a poor signal/noise ratio/43/.
gF NMR Spectra
19F NMR Spectra of LnH and corresponding di-n-butyltin(IV) complexes (10,11 and 12) have been
recorded relative to CFC13. LnH gives a single fluorine resonance peak at 6 -75.2 ppm while 10,11 and 12
show absorption peaks at 5 -70.6 ppm, 5 -71.4 ppm and 6 -72.6 ppm, respectively. Similar downfield shifting
in fluorine resonance chemical shift has been reported in literature/44/, which suggests the non-involvement
of the fluorine atom in bonding.
llgSn NMR Spectra
These mixed ligand diorganotin(IV) complexes have been subjected to l9Sn NMR studies and their
results have been cited in Table 4. These complexes show 9Sn NMR signals in the range 5 -270.81 to
390.57 ppm. l9Sn NMR chemical shift values have been found to be influenced by the coordination number
of tin atom/41/. These 19Sn NMR data are consistent with the earlier reported values/37,41,45/for hexa
coordinated diorganotin(IV) complexes.
Antimicrobiai Results
Preliminary screening for antimicrobial activities of the stock solutions of metal complexes and
corresponding organic moieties (LH,AH) were performed qualitatively using the disc diffusion assay.
Antimicrobial activities were measured from the diameter of clear inhibition zones caused by compounds.
Four compounds (I,4,7 and 10) were found to yield clear inhibition zones around the discs (Table 5).
Qualitative AntimicrobialActivity Results
Almost all the compounds were found to be more active than the heterocyclic [-diketones (LH), N-
phthaloyl amino acids (AH) against all the organisms used. It may therefore, be concluded that the

biochemical properties of the molecules are greater when metallation takes place. The results inferred that all
the compounds were active against gram positive bacteria while less active against gram negative bacteria (E.
coli). These mixed ligand di-n-butyltin(IV) complexes are more active as compared to the parent organic
moieties which indicates that metallation increases the antimicrobial activity/46/. Although it is difficult to
deduce an exact structure-activity relationship between the structure of these complexes and their microbial
activities but the high activity of these complexes may be explained on the basis of the chelation theory/47/.
Due to chelation of the metal ion, the polarity is reduced considerably on account of the partial sharing of its
positive charge with the donor groups and the n electron delocalization over the whole chelate ring system.
This, in turn increases the lipophilic character of the metal favouring its permeation through the lipid layer of
the fungal membrane.
Quantitative Antimicrobial Activity Results
The MIC values have been recorded for I, 4, 7, 10 and the data have been summarised in Table 6. The
MIC values of 1, 4 and 7 against different pathogenic fungi and bacteria suggest that the complexes are
strongly antibacterial but poorly antifungal. While 10 is as good an antifungal agent as the commercially
available antifungal agent Nystatin, the biological activity of LH,AH and their metal complexes is expected
to be a function of steric, electronic and pharmokinetic factors/48/.

Br-C6H,-,-CF3 and R' -H,-CH3,-CH(CH3)2 are found to be monomeric in nature. The heterocyclic 13-
diketones (LH) and N-phthaloyl amino acids (All) have been suggested as bidentate O donor chelating
moieties. In these derivatives C-Sn-C lies in the range of 149.88 to 156.84 found for di-n-butyltin(IV)
chelates in which the nBu substituents do not adopt cis or trans geometries about the central tin atom. It is
best described as a skew trapezoidal bipyramidal geometry (Fig. 3).
