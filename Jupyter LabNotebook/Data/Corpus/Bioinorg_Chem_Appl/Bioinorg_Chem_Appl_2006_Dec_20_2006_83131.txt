INTRODUCTION
We have already drawn attention 
			                   [–] to the strong relationship between metals or their complexes, and antibacterial [–], antitumour [–], and anticancer [, ] activities. A number of in vivo studies have indicated [–] that biologically active compounds become more
bacteriostatic and carcinostatic upon chelation. Such interaction of transition-metal ions with amino acids and peptides is of immense biological importance
[–]. It has been reported [–] that metal complexes of amino acid Schiff bases with transition metals possess anticarcinogenic activity. Various tumors tend to have poor blood supplies, and therefore amino acids have been effectively used to direct nitrogen mustards into the cancer cells. For example, phenylalanine mustard is used
in controlling malignant myeloma [] and Burkett's lymphoma [], and similarly sarcolysine [] is used to treat
wide range of tumors. Indeed, certain tumors and cancer cells are
unable to produce all the amino acids synthesized by the normal
cells. Therefore, these cells require an external supply of such
essential amino acids to pass on to the cancer cells by the blood
stream. In the recent past, a number of studies have highlighted the use of acetylacetone in various significant applications [–]. In the present studies, ligands (L1)–(L5) () were
obtained by the condensation reaction between amino acids
(glycine, phenylalanine, alanine, valine, or histidine) and
acetylacetone with this hope that it may provide us valuable
theoretical information for exploring metal-based bacteriostatic
and/or carcinostatic pharmaceuticals with high efficacy and low
toxicity. In this effort, we have also introduced an azomethine
(−C=N) linkage with the concern that it may
permit a notable variety in the remarkable chemistry and behavior
of such compounds. The synthesized amino acid-derived compounds
(L1)–(L5) have been exposed to act as
bidentate towards divalent metal atoms solely through the
azomethine-N and carboxylato groups forming a stable 5-membered
chelate ring system. The metal(II) complexes, (1)–(40) of the
types [M(L)(H2O)4] and
[M(L)2(H2O)2]Cl (where M = Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) and L = amino acid-derived ligands (L1)–(L5)) were formed by a stoichiometric ratio of M : L as (1 : 2) and (1 : 1),
respectively. These two different stoichiometric ratios of the
ligand incorporated with the metal ion were used in order to study
the effect of the presence of one or two ligands, respectively, on
the biological activity. All these compounds have been
characterized by their IR, NMR, molar conductance, magnetic
moment, and elemental analyses. The IR of the ligands and their
corresponding metal(II) complexes are in agreement with the
proposed structures. The magnetic moment and electronic spectral
data suggest for all the complexes to have an octahedral
geometry. Elemental analyses and NMR spectral data of the ligands
and their metal(II) complexes also agree with the structures as
anticipated. All these ligands along with their metal(II)
complexes were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity
against four Gram-negative (E coli, S flexenari, P
aeruginosa, and S typhi) and two Gram-positive (B
subtilis and S aureus) bacterial strains and for in
vitro antifungal activity against T longifusus, C
albicans, A flavus, M canis, F solani, and C glaberata. These
compounds have shown varied antibacterial and antifungal
activities against one or more bacterial/fungal strains
and this activity enhanced on coordination/chelation. The reported
compounds are not only good candidates as antibacterial and
antifungal agents, but also are a promising addition of
new class of compounds as the metal-based drugs.

EXPERIMENTAL
Material and methods
Solvents used were analytical grades; all metal(II) were used as
chloride salts. IR spectra were recorded on the Philips Analytical
PU 9800 FTIR spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were recorded on
Perkin-Elmer 283B spectrometer. UV-visible spectra were obtained
in DMF on a Hitachi U-2000 double-beam spectrophotometer. C, H,
and N analyses, conductance and magnetic measurements were carried
out on solid compounds using the respective instruments. Melting
points were recorded on a Gallenkamp apparatus and are not
corrected. The complexes were analyzed for their metal contents by
EDTA titration []. Antibacterial and antifungal screening
was done at HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry, International
Center for Chemical Sciences, University of Karachi, Pakistan.

Preparation of Schiff-bases (L1)–(L5)
Acetylacetone (20 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) was
added to a stirred solution of the amino acid (20 mmol) in
water (30 mL). The mixture was refluxed for 4–6 hours
during which the color of the solution turned to yellow-orange.
The completion of reaction was monitored through TLC. After
completion of the reaction, it was cooled to afford a solid
product. The solid residue was filtered, washed with ethanol, then
with ether, and dried. Crystallization from a mixture of
ethanol-propanol (60 : 40) afforded the desired ligands. The same
method was applied for the preparation of all other ligands by
using the corresponding amino acids and/or acetylacetone, working
in the same conditions with their respective molar ratio.

Preparation of metal(II) complexes
For the preparation of metal(II) complexes, a solution (30 mL)
of the corresponding ligand in hot methanol was added to a stirred
solution of metal(II) chloride in ethanol (25 mL) having a
required molar ratio of M : L (1 : 1 and 1 : 2). The mixture was
refluxed for 3 hours and then cooled to room temperature which
solidified on cooling. The solid thus obtained was filtered,
washed with methanol/ethanol and ether, and finally dried in air
to afford the desired product. Crystallization from aqueous/ethanol (40 : 60) gave the expected metal complex.

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY
Antibacterial bioassay (in vitro)
All the synthesized ligands (L1)–(L5) and
their corresponding metal(II) complexes (1)–(20) were screened in
vitro for their antibacterial activity against four Gram-negative
(E coli, S flexenari, P aeruginosa, and S typhi) and two
Gram-positive (B subtilis and S aureus)
bacterial strains using agar-well diffusion method []. Two to eight hours old bacterial inoculums containing approximately
104–106 colony forming units (CFU)/mL were used in these assays. The wells were dug in the media with the help of a
sterile metallic borer with centers at least 24 mm.
Recommended concentration (100 μl) of the test sample
(1 mg/mL in DMSO) was introduced in the respective wells.
Other wells supplemented with DMSO and reference antibacterial
drug, imipenum served as negative and positive controls,
respectively. The plates were incubated immediately at
37°C for 20 hours. Activity was determined by measuring
the diameter of zones showing complete inhibition (mm). Growth
inhibition was compared [] with the standard drug. In order
to clarify any participating role of DMSO in the biological
screening, separate studies were carried out with the solutions
alone of DMSO and they showed no activity against any bacterial
strains.

Antifungal activity (in vitro)
Antifungal activities of all compounds were studied against six
fungal cultures, T longifusus, C albicans, A flavus, M
canis, F solani, and C glaberata. Sabouraud dextrose
agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) was seeded with 105 (cfu)
 mL−1 fungal spore suspensions and was transferred to
petri plates. Discs soaked in 20 mL (10 μg/mL in
DMSO) of all compounds were placed at different positions on the
agar surface. The plates were incubated at 32°C for seven
days. The results were recorded as zones of inhibition in mm and
were compared with standard drugs Miconazole and Amphotericin B.

Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
Compounds containing antibacterial activity over 80% were
selected for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) studies
(). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined using the disc diffusion technique [] by preparing discs containing 10, 25, 50, and
100 μg/mL of the compounds and applying the protocol.

Cytotoxicity (in vitro)
Brine shrimp (Artemia salina leach) eggs were hatched in
a shallow rectangular plastic dish (22×32 cm), filled
with artificial seawater, which was prepared [] with commercial salt mixture and double distilled water. An unequal
partition was made in the plastic dish with the help of a
perforated device. Approximately 50 mg of eggs were sprinkled
into the large compartment, which was darkened while the matter
compartment was opened to ordinary light. After two days, nauplii
were collected by a pipette from the lighted side. A sample of the
test compound was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of each
compound in 2 mL of DMF. From this stock solutions, 500, 50,
and 5 μg/mL were transferred to 9 vials (three for each
dilution were used for each test sample and LD50 is the mean of three values) and one vial was kept as control having
2 mL of DMF only. The solvent was allowed to evaporate
overnight. After two days, when shrimp larvae were ready, 1 mL
of seawater and 10 shrimps were added to each vial (30
shrimps/dilution) and the volume was adjusted with seawater to
5 mL per vial. After 24 hours, the numbers of survivors were
counted. Data were analyzed by Finney computer program to
determine the LD50 values [].

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
Physicochemical properties of obtained compounds
The ligands (L1)–(L5) were prepared by
refluxing an appropriate amount of respective amino acid with the
corresponding acetylacetone in ethanol. The structures of the
synthesized ligands were established with the help of their IR,
NMR, and microanalytical data. All metal(II) complexes (1)–(40)
of these ligands were prepared by using the respective metal salts
as chloride with the corresponding ligands in two different molar
ratios of metal : ligand as 1 : 2 and 1 : 1. All these complexes
are intensively colored air and moisture stable amorphous solids
which decompose without melting. They are insoluble in common
organic solvents and only soluble in water, DMF, and DMSO. Molar
conductance values of the soluble complexes in DMF
(10−3 M solution at 25°C) indicated that
complexes having molar ratio of metal : ligand as 1 : 2
have lower values (26–35 Ohm−1 cm−2 mol−1) indicating that they are all nonelectrolytic in nature. However, the complexes having molar ratio of metal : ligand as 1 : 1 showed
higher values (122–128 Ohm−1 cm−2 mol−1) indicating them as electrolytic []. The elemental analyses data () agree well with the proposed
formulae for the ligands and also confirmed the
[M(L)2(OH2)2] () and [M(L)(OH2)4]Cl () composition of the metal(II) chelates. Efforts to grow good crystals of the ligands and their metal chelates for X-ray diffraction studies were unsuccessful due to their poor solubility
in common organic solvents.

IR spectra
Diketones and related compounds such as acetylacetone in the
present studies are capable of exhibiting keto-enol
tautomerism and react with metal cations to form metal
complexes. The selected IR spectra of the ligands and its
metal(II) complexes along with their tentative assignments are
reported in “experimental” and in , respectively. The IR spectra of all the ligands show [] the absence of bands at 3245 and 1745 cm−1 due to ν(HN2) group of amino acids and ν(C=O) of acetylacetone. Instead, a new prominent band at 1635 cm−1 due to azomethine ν(C=N) linkage appeared in all the ligands indicating [] that condensation between ketone moiety of
acetylacetone and that of amino group of amino acid has taken
place resulting into the formation of the desired ligands
(L1)–(L5). Also, the presence of bands at
3015–3025 and 3444–3450 cm−1 due to
ν(C=C) and ν(OH) in the ligands clearly gave an evidence [] of establishing keto-enol tautomeric
system in which these ligands behave as enol. Moreover, on
comparison of the IR spectra of the ligands with their metal(II)
complexes showed [] a major shift to lower wave numbers by
15–20 cm−1 in azomethine ν(C=N) at
1610–1620 cm−1 suggesting involvement of the
azomethine-N with the metal(II) ion. Also, disappearance of the
stretching frequency at 1700–1708 cm−1 assigned to
ν(COOH) and appearance of new 
νas and νs modes of the (−CO2) group at 1590 and 1385 cm−1, respectively, the Δν value (205 cm−1) is consistent with carboxylate coordination with the metal atoms. These overall data suggest that the azomethine-N and carboxylate-O groups are involved in coordination with the
metal(II) ion in complexes (1)–(40). In the low-frequency region,
spectra of the metal(II) complexes () exhibited
[] new bands which are not present in the spectra of the
ligands. These bands are located at 525 and 470 cm−1,
which are attributed to ν(M−O) and ν(M−N). The coordinated water in all the metal(II) complexes presents different peaks at 990 cm−1 (rocking) and 760 cm−1 (wagging), whereas none of these vibrations appear in the spectra of uncoordinated ligands.

NMR spectra
The 1H NMR spectral data are reported along with the possible assignments in “experimental.” All the protons were found as to be in their expected region []. The conclusions drawn from these studies lend further support to
the mode of bonding discussed in their IR spectra. In the spectra
of diamagnetic Zn(II) complexes, coordination of the
ligands via azomethine-N and carboxylate-O was established by
downfield shifting of these signals in the Zn(II) complexes due to the increased conjugation and coordination []. The number of protons calculated from the integration curves
and those obtained from the values of the expected CHN analyses
agree with each other. It was observed that DMSO did not have any
coordinating effect neither on the spectra of the ligands nor on
its metal complexes.

Electronic spectra
The Co(II) complexes exhibited well-resolved bands at 17543–18018 cm−1 and a strong high-energy band at 21739–22222 cm−1 () and are assigned [] to the transitions 4T1g(F)→4T2g(F), 4T1g(F)→4T1g(P) for a high-spin octahedral geometry []. A high-intensity band at 28565–29215 cm−1 was assigned to the metal to ligand charge transfer. The magnetic susceptibility measurements
(4.7–4.9 BM) for the solid Co(II) complexes are also indicative of three unpaired electrons per Co(II) ion suggesting [] consistency with their octahedral environment. The electronic spectra of the Cu(II) complexes () showed two low-energy weak bands at 15151–15873 cm−1 and a strong high-energy band at 30255–30420 cm−1. The low-energy band in this position typically is expected for an octahedral configuration and may be assigned to 10 Dq corresponding to the transition 2Eg→2T2g
[]. The strong high-energy band, in turn, is assigned to metal → ligand charge transfer. Also, the magnetic moment values (1.9–2.2 BM) for the copper(II) are indicative of antiferromagnetic spin-spin interaction through molecular
association. Hence, the copper(II) complexes appear to be in the
octahedral geometry with d2x–d2y ground state []. The electronic spectra of the Ni(II) complexes showed d-d bands in the regions 24390–25000, 16528–16667, and 12987–13333 cm−1. These are assigned to the spin-allowed transitions 3A2g(F)→3T2g(F), 3A2g(F)→3T1g(F), and
3A2g(F)→3T1g(P),
respectively, consistent with their well-defined octahedral
configuration. The band at 29815–30335 cm−1 was assigned
to metal → ligand charge transfer. The magnetic
measurements (3.0–3.3 BM) showed two unpaired electrons per
Ni(II) ion suggesting [] also an octahedral geometry for the Ni(II) complexes. The electronic spectra of the Zn(II) complexes exhibited only a high-intensity band at 28 350–29 145 cm−1 and are assigned [] to a ligand-metal charge transfer.

Biological activity
The antibacterial activity results presented in
 show that the newly synthesized compounds
(L1)–(L5) and their metal(II) complexes
(1)–(40) possess biological activity. These new derivatives
obtained by condensation of the amino group of amino acid with
salicylaldehyde were screened for their antibacterial activity
against E coli, B subtillis, S flexenari, S aureus, P
aeruginosa, and S typhi and for antifungal activity
() against T longifusus, C albicans, A
flavus, M canis, F solani, and C glaberata. These
results exhibited markedly an enhancement in activity on
coordination with the metal ions against one or more testing
bacterial strains. This enhancement in the activity is
rationalized on the basis of the structures of, (L1)–(L5) by possessing an additional
azomethine (C=N) linkage which imports in elucidating
the mechanism of transamination and resamination
reactions in biological system [, ]. It has also
been suggested [–] that the ligands with nitrogen and oxygen donor systems might
inhibit enzyme production, since the enzymes which require these
groups for their activity appear to be especially more susceptible
to deactivation by the metal ions upon chelation. Chelation
reduces the polarity [–] of the metal ion mainly because of the partial sharing of its
positive charge with the donor groups and possibly the
π-electron delocalization within the whole chelate ring system
thus formed during coordination. This process of chelation thus
increases the lipophilic nature of the central metal atom, which
in turn favors its permeation through the lipoid layer of the
membrane. This in turn is responsible for increasing the
hydrophobic character and liposolubility of the molecule in
crossing cell membrane of the microorganism, and hence enhances
the biological utilization ratio and activity of the testing
drug/compound.

Cytotoxic bioassay
All the synthesized compounds were screened for their cytotoxicity
(brine shrimp bioassay) using the protocol of Meyer et al
[]. From the data recorded in , it is
evident that only five compounds (3), (7), (10), (11), and (22)
displayed potent cytotoxic activity as LD50 = 8.974 × 10−4, 7.022 × 10−4, 8.839×10−4, 7.133×10−4, and 9.725×10−4 M/mL, respectively, against Artemia salina while all other compounds were almost inactive for this assay.

CONCLUSION
The synthesized amino acid-derived compounds showed
antibacterial/antifungal properties. In comparison, the cobalt
(II), copper(II), nickel(II), and zinc(II) metal complexes of
these compounds showed more activity against one or more
bacterial/fungal strains, thus introducing a novel class of
metal-based bactericidal and fungicidal agents.
