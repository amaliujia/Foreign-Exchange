1. INTRODUCTION
The interaction of transition metal complexes with DNA has been extensively studied in the past few years. Metal complexes of the type [M(LL)3]n+ where LL is either 1,10,phenathroline or modified
phenanthroline ligand are particularly attractive species to recognize and cleavage DNA [–]. Barton demonstrated that tris(phenanthroline) complexes of ruthenium(II) display enantiomeric selectivity in binding to
DNA, which can be served as spectroscopic probes in solution to distinguish right- and left-handed DNA helies []. The ligands or the metal in these complexes can be varied in an easily controlled manner to facilitate an individual application. The change in the metal ion or ligand would lead to changes in the binding mode and affinity [, ]. Much attention has been paid to the complexes of Ru(II) [–]. We choose to concentrate our work on cobalt(III) ethylenediamine polypyridyl complexes which have the same interesting characteristics and DNA cleaving properties as Ru(II) complexes. We have chosen ethylenediamine because in classical antitumor agent (cis platin) one of the ligands must be N donor and possessing at least one hydrogen atom attached to nitrogen.

In this paper, we report the synthesis and characterization of the two complexes 1 and 2 (see Schemes  and ), and their binding ability to CT DNA, DNA-binding properties are studied by electronic absorption, luminescent spectra, viscosity measurement, and DNA melting curve. The photochemical DNA cleavages of the complexes are also demonstrated.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1. Materials
All materials were purchased and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. The compounds 1,10
phenanthroline-5,6-dione  [], (IP) and (PIP) [], [Co(en)2phen]Br3 []
cis-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl · 3H2O [], and [Co(en)2L]Br3 were prepared by the procedure given below. The absorption spectra of CoCl2 6H2O, cis [Co(en)2Cl2]Cl, and [Co(en)2PIP]Br3 are shown in . All the experiments involving the interaction of the complexes with DNA were carried out in buffer (5 mM tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.2). A solution of CT DNA in the buffer gave a ratio of UV absorbance at 260 and 280 nm of about 1.90 indicating that the DNA was sufficiently free of protein []. The DNA concentration per nucleotide was determined by absorption spectroscopy using the molar absorption coefficient (6600 M−1Cm−1) at 260 nm [].

3. SYNTHESIS OF COMPLEXES

It was then cooled in ice where the thick crystalline precipitate of [Co(en)2PIP]3+ was collected and recrystallized from water (30 ml). The yield by this method was about 80% (Mol. Wt 715).

4. PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS
4.1. Elemental analysis and conductivity data
Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen analyses were obtained from microanalytical Heraeus Carlo Etba 1108 elemental analyser. Chloride analysis was done. The metal contents were estimated from these solutions on atomic absorption spectrometer Perkin-Elmer 23380. The conductivity of metal complexes was measured in freshly prepared DMSO solutions using digital conductivity bridge (model: DI-909) and a dip-type cell calibrated with KCl solution.

5. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
UV/visible spectra were recorded with Elico bio-spectro-photometer, model BL198, IR spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3410, KBr phase on Perkin-Elmer FTIR-1605 spectrophotometer, 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Varian XL-300 MHz spectrometer with D2O as a solvent at room temperature and
tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard, magnetic susceptibility measurements for solid samples of the complexes were carried out using Faraday bakany model. Hg [Co(CNS)4] were employed as magnetic susceptibility standards, microanalyses (C, H, and N) were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 240 of elemental analyzer. For the absorption spectra an equal solution of DNA was added to both complex solutions and reference solution to eliminate the absorbance of DNA itself.

Viscosity experiments were carried out using an Ostwald viscometer maintained at a constant temperature at 30.0 ± 0.1°C in athermostatic water bath. Calf thymus DNA samples approximately 200 base pairs in average length were prepared by sonicating in order to minimize complexities arising from DNA flexibility [].
Data were presented as (η/η0)1/3 versus the concentration of Co(III) complexes, where η is the viscosity of DNA in presence of complex, η0 is the viscosity of DNA alone. Viscosity values were calculated from the observed flow time of DNA-containing solutions (t &gt; 100 s) corrected for the
flow time of buffer alone (t0)η = (t − t0)/t0, where t is the observed flow time of DNA and t0 is the flow time of buffer []. The DNA melting experiments were carried
by controlling the temperature of the sample cell with a Shimadzu circulating bath while monitoring the absorbance at 260 nm. For the gel electrophoresis experiments, super coiled pBR 322 DNA (100 μM) was treated with Co(III) complexes in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 18 mM NaCl buffer, pH = 7.2, and the solution was incubated for 1 hour in the dark, then irradiated at room temperature with a UV lamp (302 nm, at 10 W). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis for 2.5 hour at 40 V on a 0.8% agarose gel in Tris acetic acid EDTA buffer; pH 7.2. The gel was stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and then photographed under UV light.

6. SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION
The IR spectral data for the complexes were determined; two complexes clearly exhibit a band at 1450 and
1560–1590 cm−1, corresponding to C=C and C=N of the ring, respectively. Bands at
around 626 and 579 cm−1 corresponding to Co–N (en) and Co–N of (L=PIP, IP and phen-dione) NH2 (en) bending at around 1650 cm−1 were observed. The UV-visible spectral
peaks were observed at 317, 492, 347, 437 nm and fluorescence peaks at 407, 408, and 609 of 1, 2, and 3 complexes, respectively, based on the literatures data on the spectral properties of complexes 2 and 1. Bands appearing in the
spectra of Co(III) complexes can be assigned exclusively to MLCT charge transition bands between 400–500 nm,
, []. The electronic environment of many aromatic hydrogen atoms (PIP, IP, and phen-dione) are similar and hence their 1H NMR spectra appear in a narrow chemical shift range. In fact the aromatic regions of the spectra of these complexes are complicated due to the overlapping of several signals, which have precluded the identification of individual resonance. In the 1H NMR spectra of the cobalt(III) complexes
the peaks due to various H-atoms of PIP, IP, and phen-dione were shifted downfield compared to the free ligands suggesting complexation in . As expected the signal for PIP, IP, and phen-dione appeared in the range between 7.5 to 9.2 ppm in agreement with an earlier report [], CH2 groups of the ethylenediamine gave peaks at 2.72, (4H, en-CH2) and 3.0, (2H, en-CH2).

7. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
7.1. Absorption spectral studies
The application of electronic absorption spectroscopy is one of the most useful techniques for DNA binding studies []. Complex binding with DNA through intercalation usually results in hypochromism and bathchromism, due to the intercalative mode involving a strong stacking interaction between an aromatic chromophore and the base pairs of DNA. The extent of the hypochromism commonly parallels the intercalative binding strength. The absorption spectra of complexes 1, 2, and 3 in absence and presence of CT DNA are given in  Figures , , and . As the concentration of DNA is increased, it results in hypochromism and moderate bathochromic shift in the UV-visible spectra of three complexes 1, 2, and 3. According to the data presented in Figures , , and , it seems that the change in absorption spectra of the two complexes upon addition of DNA follows: 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3. These spectral data may suggest a mode of binding that involves a stacking interaction between the complex and the base pairs of DNA. To compare quantitatively the binding strength of the two complexes, the intrinsic binding constants K of the two complexes with CT DNA were determined according to the following equation [] through a plot of ) versus [DNA]



where [DNA] is the concentration of DNA in base pairs, the apparent absorption coefficients ∑a, ∑f, and ∑b correspond to Aobsd/[Co], the extinction coefficient for the free cobalt complex and the extinction coefficient for the free cobalt complex in the fully bound form, respectively. In plots [DNA]/(∑b − ∑f) versus [DNA], K is given by the ratio of slope to intercept. Intrinsic binding constants K of 1, 2, and 3 were obtained about 5.34 ± 0.2 × 104, 4.575 ± 0.3 × 104, and 3.9 ± 0.1 × 104 M−1 from the decay of the absorbance. The binding constants indicate that complex 1 binds strongly than 2 &gt; 3. This result is expected, since PIP possesses a greater planar area and extended π system than that of IP which will lead to PIP penetrating more deeply into and makes stacking more strongly. Hypochromism was indeed observed in the complexes with
the order being 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3.

7.2. Fluorescence studies
The complexes 1, 2, and 3 can emit luminescence in Tris buffer (pH 7.0) at ambient temperature with maxima at 408, 407, and 609 nm. Binding of both complexes to DNA was found to increase the fluorescence intensity. The emission spectra of both complexes in the absence and presence of CT DNA are shown in Figures , , and . The plots of the relative intensity versus the ratio of [DNA]/[Co] are also inserted in Figures , , and . Upon addition of CT DNA, the emission intensity increases steadily. The emission intensity difference between absence of CT DNA and presence of CT DNA is greater for PIP complex than IP and phen-dione complex as shown in Figures , , and . The extent of enhancement increases on going from
3 to 2 to 1 and which is consistent with the above absorption spectra results. The order of increase in emission intensity of complexes is 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3. These results were strengthened by viscosity studies.

This observation is further supported by the emission quenching experiments using [Fe(CN)6]4− as quencher. The method essentially consists of titrating a given amount of DNA binding-metal complexes with increasing the concentration of [Fe(CN)6]4− and measuring the change in fluorescence
 intensity. The ion [Fe(CN)6]4− has been shown to be able to distinguish differentially bound Cobalt(III) complexes. The positively charged free complex ions should be readily quenched by [Fe(CN)6]4−, where as DNA bound cobalt complex is protected from the quencher, because highly negatively charged [Fe(CN)6]4− would be repelled by the negatively change DNA phosphate backbone. The
ferro-cyanide quenching curves for 1, 2, and 3 in the presence and absence of CT DNA are shown in . Obviously complex 1 inserts into DNA much deeper than complexes 2 and 3. The absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy studies thus determine the binding of complexes with DNA.

7.3. Viscosity studies
The mode of the two complexes binding to DNA was explained by viscosity measurements. Optical photo-physical probes are necessary, but do not give sufficient clues to support a binding model. Hydrodynamic measurements that are
sensitive to length change (i.e., viscosity and sedimentation) are regarded as the least ambiguous []. For complexes 2 and 1 the viscosity of DNA increases highly with the increasing of the concentration of complex which is similar to that of proven intercaltor EtBr []. Both complexes change the relative viscosity of DNA in a manner consistent with binding by intercalation mode shown in . This result also parallels the pronounced hypochromism and spectral red shift and emission enhancement of both complexes, whereas this result is
comparable with proven classical intercalator EtBr. Viscosity of DNA increases with the increase of the concentration
of EtBr. So these two complexes increase DNA helix length. On the basis of the viscosity results, it shows that complexes
bind with DNA through intercalation mode. The order of increase in viscosity of complexes follows the order 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3.

7.4. DNA melting studies
Another strong evidence for binding of the complexes 1, 2, and 3 to the double helix of DNA is the melting temperature Tm. The binding of small molecules into the double helix is known to increase the helix melting temperature. Helix melting temperature is the temperature at which the double helix is denatured into
single-stranded DNA. The extinction coefficient of DNA bases at 260 nm in the double-helical form is much less than in the
single stranded form. Hence melting of the helix leads to an increase in the absorption at this wavelength. Thus the transition temperature from helix to coil can be determined by monitoring the absorbance of the DNA base at 260 nm as a function of temperature. The melting curves of CT DNA in the absence and presence of 1, 2, and 3 are presented in . The increase in the melting temperature values of IP and PIP comparable to the value observed () with the classical intercalators EtBr. It is clear from these figures that the complexes 1 and 2 are intercalator because the relative absorbance is so high compared to that of the pure DNA sample. The increase in absorbance of complexes follows the order 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3.

8. PHOTOACTIVATED CLEAVAGE OF pBR 322
DNA BY COMPLEXES
There has been considerable interest in DNA endonucleolytic cleavage reactions that are activated by metal ions [, ]. The delivery of high concentrations of metal ion to the helix, in locally generating oxygen or hydroxide radicals, leads to an efficient DNA cleavage reaction. DNA cleavage was monitored by relation of supercoiled circular pBR 322 (form I) into nicked circular (form II) and linear (form III). When circular plasimd DNA is subjected to electrophoresis, relatively fast migration will be observed for the supercoiled form (form I). If scission occurs on one strand (nicking), the supercoils will relax to generate a slower-moving open circular form (form II) []. If both strands are cleaved, a linear form (form III) will be generated that migrates between forms I and II.  shows the gel electrophoretic separations of plasmid pBR 322 DNA after incubation with Co(III) complexes and irradiation at 302 nm.  reveals the conversion of Form I and II after 60 min irradiation in the presence of varying concentrations of 1, 2, and 3. It was observed that by increasing the concentration of 1, 2, and 3, form (I) slightly diminishes gradually. The same has been observed with increasing irradiation time. This is the result of single stranded cleavage of pBR322 DNA. It can also be seen in  that neither irradiation of DNA at 302 nm without Co(III) nor incubation with Co(III) without light yields significant strand scission. It is most likely that the reduction of Co(III) is the important step leading to DNA cleavage. Further studies are required to find out the path of reaction mechanism.

9. CONCLUSIONS
The binding behavior of complexes 1, 2, and 3 with DNA was characterized by absorption titration, fluorescence quenching, and viscosity measurements. The results show that the binding constants followed the order: 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 which is consistent with the extended planar and π system of PIP.
