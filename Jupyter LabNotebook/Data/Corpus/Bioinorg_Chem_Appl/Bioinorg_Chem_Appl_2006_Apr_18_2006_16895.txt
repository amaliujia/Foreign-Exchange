INTRODUCTION
Organic compounds containing −NC6H4S− unit are well known for their significant biological activities []. Phenothiazenes significantly affect the hypothalamous pituitary gonadal axis, resulting in a delay in
ovulation and menstruation in women []. These effects have also been observed in rats and dogs [, ]. 
The rate of implantation was lowered, and reduction in litter size has been
reported by some phenothiazine derivatives [, ]. 
In general biological activity of such type of compounds enhances
considerably on complexation with metal atom []. 
We have earlier reported the antifertility activity of organoantimony(III)
[] and aluminium(III) [] 
derivatives of benzothiazolines. In respect of the reproductive and developmental
toxicity, antimony compounds have also been studied in
experimental model: no teratogenic effects were found, when
pregnant ewes and rats were treated with trivalent antimony
potassium tartrate (2 mg/Kgbt) and antimony trichloride (0.1
and 1 mg/dl), respectively [, ]. 
Antimony had quite widespread use in pharmacology for the treatment of syphilis,
fever,    melancholy,   pneumonia, epilepsy, and
inflammatory conditions []. Organic antimony  salts are
used medically to treat some tropical diseases [],
especially in the treatment of all forms of leishmenasis
[].  Organoantimony compounds also exhibit significant
antimicrobial [] as well as antitumor activities
[, ], which is associated 
with cytostatic activity [] similar to that for cisplatin. The biological toxicity
of these derivatives is much less than that for Pt and Pd
anticancer substances [, ]. 
A large number of antimony(III) compounds have also been tested as bactericides
[] and fungicides [].

A survey of literature revealed that so far no
attention has been paid to compare the effects of benzothiazoline
ligand with its metal derivatives on the reproductive system of
male rats. In view of this, we have synthesized and characterized
the benzothiazoline ligand and its organoantimony(V) derivative.
In the present publication, a comparative study among the effects
on the reproductive systems of male albino rats of the
corresponding ligand, 1a, and its organoantimony(V)
derivative, 1b, versus control animals is presented, and
also a comparison of the effects of these compounds 1a
and 1b is made pertaining to their antispermatogenic
activities.

EXPERIMENTAL
In view of the moisture sensitive nature of the starting materials, all the
synthetic reactions were performed under moisture free conditions.
All the chemicals used were of reagent grade. Solvents (E Merck)
were dried by standard methods before use. Ph3SbBr2
[] and triphenylantimony(V) isopropoxide [] were
prepared by literature methods. The benzothiazoline ligand
, 1a, was prepared  by the reported method [, ] and was purified by
distillation under vacuum (85–88°C, 0.1 atm)
before use. Organoantimony(V) derivative, 1b, of the
benzothiazoline was prepared () by the
reported method []. Antimony was estimated iodometrically
[]. Nitrogen and sulphur were estimated by Kjeldahl's and Messenger's methods, respectively []. Isopropanol and isopropoxide were estimated by the chromate oxidimetric method
[]. Molecular weight of the organoantimony(V) derivative,
1b, was determined ebullioscopically using Beckmann's
thermometer. IR spectra of these compounds were recorded on a
Nicolet DX FTIR spectrophotometer in the range
4000–200 cm−1 on a CsI cell. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in DMSO-d6 solution on a JEOL-FX-90Q (90 MHz) or Brucker DPX-300 MHz spectrometer, using TMS as
an internal and external references, respectively.

BIOLOGICAL TESTS
Sexually mature male albino rats of laboratory bred, Wistar strain
weighing about 150–175 g (90–100 days old) were used in the
experiments. They were acclimatized to the normal laboratory
conditions of light-dark cycle (12L:12D) with the temperature
around 20 ± 5°C and 35%–60% relative humidity.
Animals were given standard rat diet [Ashirwad Industries Ltd] and
water ad libitum throughout the study.

The animals were randomly allocated into three experimental groups
of six rats each. In the first control group, only olive oil
(0.5 mL/rat/day) was orally administered for 60 days. In the
second and third groups, oral administration of the corresponding
ligand, 1a, and its  organoantimony(V)  derivative,
1b, was given in olive oil at the same doses
(10 mg/rat/day) for 60 days.

The fertility test of each experimental male rat was assessed by
natural mating with two pro-estrous and virgin females, before,
during, and after days 55 to 60 of the treatment. The
presence of sperm cells in the vaginal smears was accepted as
evidence of copulation. Mated females were separated and then
allowed to complete the term. The number of litters delivered was
recorded and used as an index for fertility of the males. Body
weights of the experimental rats were monitered throughout the
study. All experimental males were sacrificed under light ether
anaesthesia, approximately 24 hours following the last dose. Final
body weights of the animals were recorded. Blood samples were
collected by cardiac puncture and serum was separated by
centrifugation. Testosterone was determined by Radio Immuno Assay.
Epididymal sperm motility and number of spermatozoa in the
epididymides and testes were determined by the method of Prasad
et al []. The testes, epididymides, and
other accessory sex organs were excised and freed from the
surrounding fat and connecting tissues and weighed. Biochemical
estimations of protein, sialic acid, glycogen, cholesterol, and
fructose [–] 
were carried out in testes, epididymides, and other accessory sex organs. For histopathological
examination, tissues were fixed in Bouin's fluid and several
sections of the testes were prepared and stained by means of
haematoxylin and eosin. Testicular cell population dynamics was
performed by using “Camera Lucida” drawing. Mean seminiferous
tubular diameter was determined. Various testicular cell
components were quantitatively analyzed []. Difference
between groups were compared by using one way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by the individual paired “T test.” Differences
were considered to be statistically significant when P &lt; .01. All
data are presented as mean ± SEM.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Triphenylantimony(V) derivative, 1b, of the
benzothiazoline ligand, 1a, has been synthesized
() and characterized by the reported method
[].

The light brown colored, viscous compound, 1b, is soluble
in common organic solvents. Ebullioscopic molecular weight
measurement reveals its monomeric nature in benzene solution as
reported earlier [].

ANTIFERTILITY ACTIVITY
Oral administration of corresponding ligand, 1a, and its
antimony derivative, 1b, reduce fertility in treated
rats. The body weight of the rats treated with these compounds
(1a and 1b) was not affected during the course
of the experiments. However, the weights of testes, epididymides,
seminal vesicles, and ventral prostate were reduced
significantly (P &lt; .01) in 1a and 1b treated
rats than those in the control group ().
Motility of spermatozoa, removed from the cauda epididymides of
the treated rats (1a and 1b), was highly
depressed when compared with control animals
(). Sperm density in testes and in cauda
epididymides was depleted significantly (P &lt; .01) in both treated
groups (group II and III) as compared to controls
().

Significant loss of sperm motility and density give rise to
100% sterility in 1a and 1b treated rats.
Testosterone level in both the treated groups reduced
significantly (). Suppressive effects of these
compounds were noticed () in protein content
and sialic acid content of testes, epididymides, and other
accessory sex organs. Testicular glycogen content and fructose
content of seminal vesicles were also decreased, whereas
testicular cholesterol was elevated in this investigation.

The ligand, 1a, and its corresponding metal derivative,
1b, used in this investigation resulted in weight loss of
testes and other accessory sex organs mainly due to hormone
deficiency. Testes produce the male gametes and a site of
spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis is regulated by pituitary
hormones (FSH, LH), secreted into the peripheral circulation and
by androgen, synthesized and secreted in close  proximity  to
target sites within the testes []. Thus testes,
epididymides, and other accessory sex organs are
androgen-dependent for their growth and function. Reduction in
weights may reflect a declined amount and synthesis of androgen
within these organs []. Decrease in sperm motility and
density could compromise the fertility []. Low sperm
concentration is associated with low fertility. The spermatozoa
can utilize glucose as well as fructose [, ]. Fructose is
the main source of energy required by spermatozoa. The results
from this study indicate that these compounds (1a and
1b) decrease the fructose level, since the inhibition of
fructose and the decrease in sperm motility were always correlated
[]. Immotility of sperm may be due to structural defects of
the flagellum, for example, axonemal microtubular abnormalities or
defective mitochondria [–].

The results demonstrate a marked decreases in testicular glycogen.
Such glycolytic inhibition may explain the  reduced  sperm
motility observed in vitro in the absence of lactate and pyruvate
[, ]. A marked decrease in the glycogen content could
affect protein synthesis and thus subsequently inhibit
spermatogenesis []. The integrity and functional activity
of sperm membrane are crucial for viability and, also, for the
physiological changes that occur at the sperm surface during the
fertilization process including capacitation, acrosome
reaction, and binding to the zona pellucida and oolemma
[]. Sialic acids are concerned with changing the membrane
surface of maturing spermatozoa and with the development of their
fertilizing capacity []. Thus decreased sialic acid may
inhibit the fertilizing capacity of sperm.

 The production of preleptotene
spermatocytes, pachytene spermatocytes, and secondary
spermatocytes was decreased by 42%, 43%, and 39%,
respectively, in 1a treated rats and by 44%, 49%,
and 55%, respectively, in 1b treated rats. The total
number of Sertoli cells and seminiferous tubular diameter were
also reduced in 1a and 1b treated rats as
compared to the control group (). Sertoli cells
decreased significantly in these series of experiments. Sertoli
cells synthesized and secreted ABP's (androgen binding proteins)
that are believed to serve as a reservoir for testosterone and
maintaining the high intratubular concentrations, necessary for
completion of spermatogenesis []. Alteration in the Sertoli
cells affect the production of ABP which in turn lead to
inhibition of the spermatogenesis []. The effect of metal
administration produces unmistakable damage to the Sertoli cells
[]. Reduction in the number of spermatogonia,
spermatocytes, and spermatids may indicate lower availability of
FSH and LH, which are essential for initiation and maintainance of
spermatogenesis. Cholesterol is a precursor for androgen
biosynthesis and its level in testes is closely related to
fertility and sperm output. Accumulation of cholesterol indicates
its reduced conversion into the androgen []. It is known
that sperm production cannot proceed optimally to completion
without a continuous androgen supply [].

From the above results it may be concluded that the
benzothiazoline ligand, 1a, and its corresponding
organoantimony(V) derivative, 1b, used in this
investigation, are able to reduce fertility in male rats possibly
by interfering the process of spermatogenesis, and it is found
that the compound 1b has more suppressive effects on male
reproductive systems as compared to its corresponding ligand,
1a. These results are in close agreement with the earlier
reports on the enhanced activity of metal complexes in comparison
to the parent ligand [].
