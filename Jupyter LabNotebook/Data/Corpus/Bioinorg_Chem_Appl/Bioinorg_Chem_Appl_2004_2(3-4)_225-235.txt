ABSTRACT
A new oxamide ligand 2,2'-(oxalydimino)bis(diacetic acid)[Cl0H2010N2],[L] has been synthesized by the
condensation reaction of Iminodiacetic acid and Diethyloxalate. This ligand [L] was further allowed to
interact with triethylene-tetraamine metal complexes [C16Hz6N6OsM]CI2 (where M Co1, Ni and Cu) to
yield the new N4 macrocyclic complexes 3, 3', 6, 6' tetraazadodeca 1-1' diimino N N tetraacetic acid M)
chloride ([C16H26N6OsCo]C12, [CI6H26N6OsNi]C12 and [C16H26N6OgCu]CI2). These complexes were
characterized by elemental analyses, i.r., n.m.r., e.p.r, and u.v.-vis spectroscopy. All the complexes show
square planar geometry and are ionic in nature. The kinetic studies of the Cu(lI) complex were ascertained
spectrophotometrically by observing the absorbance changes in presence of protein Human Serum Albumin
(HSA) in phosphate buffer at different pH's at 30C. The absorbance changes were monitored at 278 nm
(kmax of HSA) with respect to time and pseudo-first-order rate constants, kobs, were obtained from the slope of
the straight line using the least squares regression method. The electrochemical behaviour of the Cu(ll)
complex was monitored by cyclic voltammetry in a phosphate buffer. The Ep values-0.730 and-0.560 V
respectively, were obtained at the scan rate of 0. Vs1. The interaction of the Cu(II) complex with the HSA
was studied at the same scan rate, which reveals weak binding as the E values do not shift considerably. The
cyclic voltammogram of the Cu(II) complex bound to HSA was recorded at different pH's also (6.5 to 7.4).
The pH-rate profile data reveals that the reactions are pH dependent.

1. INTRODUCTION
Transition metal ions Cu(ll), Ni(ll) and Zn(ll) bind to imidazole side chain of surface exposed histidines
of proteins/1-3/. However, the binding to protein active site domain is stereospecific/4/. Much emphasis has
been laid on the design of compounds with increased affinity for a molecular target due to wide applications

From Oxamide Ligand and the Reactivity fCu(ll)
in pharmaceutical industries /5-8/. Protein-ligand complexes were designed to maximize the interactions
between a protein and a small molecule or, alternatively, alter the chemical properties viz. solubility without
disrupting binding. The same approach has been employed to design compounds with decreased affinity for
HSA. Compounds having reduced affinity for serum albumin can prove as potent drugs with significantly
lower dosage levels and improved in vivo tolerance/9/.
The Human Serum Albumin (HSA) are the major soluble protein constituents of the circulatory system,
hence involved in the transport, distribution and metabolism of many endogenous ligands such as fatty acids,
bilirubin, amino acids, metals etc and numerous pharmaceuticals as well/10-13/. The main function of this
protein is as carrier and recent report on HSA reveals the binding studies of Penicillins to HSA.[14,15].
HSA's have six different lysine residues and one of these groups, Lys-199 is the most probable binding site
for compounds/16/(Fig. 1).
To study the specific interactions of HSA-metal complex having reduced albumin binding, herein we
report the design and synthesis of novel metal complexes derived from oxamidediiminodiacetic and
triethylene tetramine. Cyclic voltammetry and kinetic experiments were performed in phosphate buffer at
different pH's to ascertain the binding mode of the Cu(ll) complex of oxamidediiminodiacetic acid to HSA.
In our earlier work/17/, we have studied the effect of the Co(ll) complex of 1,2bis(sulphapyridyl)oxamide
with Bovine Milk Casein (BMC.)

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 EPR spectra
The e.p.r, spectra of the Cu(ll) complex, recorded at 30C, shows a signal for g and g+/- at 2.16 and 2.05
respectively. The existence of g > g_ suggests that dx2_); is the ground state for the d9
[Cu2+] configuration
i.e. (eg4) (ag)2
(b2g) (bg) /19/. The g values are related to the axial symmetry parameter G by the
expression G (g- 2/g_- 2)/20/. The g value measures the extent of exchange interaction between the
copper centers in polycrystalline solids. If G < 4, considerable exchange interaction occurs and if G > 4,
exchange interaction is negligible. In the present case, G appears to be greater than 4, which shows that
exchange interactions are absent in the complex. The presence of gl > g_ in the spectrum of the Cu(ll)
complex is an authentic evidence for square planar geometry around the copper(ll) atom/21/.
3.2. Electronic spectra
The electronic spectra of the Cu(ll) complex exhibit two bands at 32,573, and 16,666 cm.The assignments
of the spectral band at 16,666 attributed to 2B 2E 2Blg ,.. g and lg-'-'-'- 2Alg cm-! transitions/22/and
the other band at 32,573 cm-1
correspond to a ligand to metal charge transfer band (LMCT) respectively/23/
(Fig. 2). The presence of this charge transfer band in visible region has been attributed to a square planar
arrangement around the Cu(II) center/24/.
The Co(If) complex also exhibits intense bands in high energy region 33,220-26,525 cm which are
assigned to charge transfer M L bands. The two low energy bands are identified at 20,080 and 19,521
cm
-due to 2Alg 2Eg transition indicating square planar geometry/25/. The electronic spectra of Ni(ll)
complex also shows two bands at 26,455 and 16,886 cm-. The band at 26,455 cm1
has been assigned to
Ag-- Bg transition /26,27/. A single intense d-d characteristic band at 16,886 cm
-is attributed to
diamagnetic square planar Ni(II) complex/28-30/.

3.3. Redox behaviour
The redox behaviour of the Cu(ll) complex was studied by cyclic voltammetric measurement in
phosphate buffer. The cyclic voltammogram of Cu(II) complex exhibits one quasi-reversible redox couple
corresponding to the Cun/Cu with Ep values -0.730 and-0.560V respectively at a scan rate of 0.1 Vs
[Fig.3a]. For this couple, the difference between cathodic and anodic potential AEp is of the order 128 mV
and the lpa/Ipc value is less than one. At different scan rates [Fig. 3b], there is no major change in Ep and
values, clearly indicating that Ep is independent of scan rate. For a reversible/quasi-reversible wave Ep is
independent of scan rate and Ip is proportional to v/2/31, 32/. On interaction of the Cu(II) complex with
HSA, there is a slight shift in Ep values of-0.799 and -0.541 V respectively, at the same scan rate [Fig. 4a],
suggesting the binding of HSA with the Cu(II) complex but as the shifts in formal potential of the complex
are not so significant (Fig. 4b), therefore it is inferred that the Cu(II) complex exhibits reduced binding for
serum albumin.

The cyclic voltammogram of the Cu(il) complex bound to HSA was recorded at different pH's (6.0-7.4).
Figure 5 shows the plots of Ep versus pH's. At lower pH 6.0, E values are lowest due to partial involvement
of imidazole nitrogen of HSA. The pH dependence in histidine-metal interactions has also been demonstrated
earlier/33/.

3.4. Protein HSA binding studies
The u.v./vis, spectrum of Cu(II) complex in phosphate buffer reveals a M-L charge transfer band at 307
nm and a d-d transition at 66:2 nm.
Interaction of Human Serum Albumin with the Cu(II) complex was studied at max of" HSA (:278 nm)
under pseudo first order conditions. The absorbance changes with varying concentrations (c x 10 to x
l0 mol dm) of HSA in buffer solution were recorded at fixed concentration ofthe Cu(ll) complex ( c 0.5
x 10 tool dm-) at the different time intervals at 30C After the addition of HSA at the different time
intervals (Fig. 6), there is a steep decrease in absorption intensity indicative of hypochromicity; however, no
band shift has been observed. The spectral evidence support the binding of HSA to the Cu(II) complex but as
the absorbance spectra does not record any shift in the wavelength, the reduced binding or low binding
affinity for HSA is concluded. The rational design of compounds with reduced albumin binding has been
limited due to lack of binding data to albumin active sites. These results are important in understanding the

pH Profile
We have also studied the reaction kinetics of the Cu(II) complex in the presence of HSA at different pH
values and consequent changes in absorption spectra were observed. There is a negligible change in the
absorbance spectra in 6.0 7.4 pH range. At pH 7.4 the absorption spectra does not show any shift although a
high maxima is observed indicating that the interaction between the complex and serum albumin is weak.
However as the pH values decreases, the intensity ofthe absorption peak at 278 nm (kmax of HSA) decreases,
indicating that the coordination of the Cu(II) complex to serum protein may take place through imidazole
side chains of surface exposed histidine ofprotein/33/.
The plots of kobs versus HSA at different pH's give a straight line suggesting that all the reactions are of
pseudo-first order type (Fig. 9).
