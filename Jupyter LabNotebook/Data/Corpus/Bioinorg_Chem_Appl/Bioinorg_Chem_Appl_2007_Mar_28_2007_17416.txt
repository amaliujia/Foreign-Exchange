1. INTRODUCTION
The chemical bond in linear three-body systems, such
as trihalides, has been the object of many papers appeared very recently in the
literature [–]. Among them, the paper on trihalides and hydrogen dihalides published by Hoffmann et al. [], the book edited by Akiba [] “Chemistry of hypervalent
compounds” appeared in 1999, and the chapter on hypervalent chalcogen
compounds by Nakanishi [] in “Handbook of chalcogen chemistry” edited by F. A. Devillanova, represent authoritative contributions to this topic. In particular, the paper by Hoffman analyzes, on the basis of theoretical calculations, the various contributions to the stabilization of trihalides, by comparing the
Rundle-Pimentel [, ] model for electron-rich 3-centre 4-electron systems () with that describing the interhalogenic bond as a donor/acceptor or
charge-transfer interaction between a halide and a dihalogen molecule ().

The commonly accepted 3 centre-4 electron bonding model considers the central halogen to be hypervalent. According to this model, a linear system formed for example by three aligned closed-shell I− (24 shell electrons overall, I33−) has no reason to exist since the three MOs generated by the combination of the three pz   orbitals, one from each interacting anion
(), should be fully occupied by six electrons. However, the removal of two electrons from the antibonding MO causes an effective stabilization of the system and affords the well-known 22 shell electrons I3− anion (). The stability of I3− is determined by the occupancy of the lowest MO since the second filled MO is nonbonding in nature. The four electrons on the σ MOs plus the 6 electrons on the other three filled atomic orbitals equal a total of 10 electrons on the central I atom; this accounts for its description as an hypervalent species. However, a more
formal counting indicates that only 8 electrons can be assigned to the central
iodine since the HOMO is a combination out of phase of the pz orbitals of the external iodine atoms; consequently, no electron density coming from this MO can be assigned to the
central iodine.

The alternative description of I3− according to a
Lewis model, which considers an sp2 I+ cation having three lone pairs on the plane perpendicular to the bond direction and two hybrid orbitals able to
linearly coordinate two I− anions (), leads again to assign 10 electrons to the central iodine.

However, this model implies the combination of the dz2 and  atomic orbitals of the central I+ to afford two unfilled hybrid orbitals able to accommodate two lone pairs from the two
I− anions. According to this description, a simple notation, introduced by
Arduengo et al. [], identifies the central I
atom as a 10−I−2 species, where “10” indicates the number of the electrons
around the cental I, and “2” the number of the atoms or groups bonded to it.
We must note that this formalism accounts very well for the hypervalent nature
(expansion of the octet) of the central iodine, but does not account for the
strength of the two bonds formed; in fact, according to such a model, each
bond, arising from the localization of a pair of electrons from I−, should
have a bond order of 1.

The simplest way to prepare a triiodide or in general
a trihalide species considers the reaction between an X− anion with an X2
molecule (X− + X2→ X3−). In terms of chemical bond description, this corresponds to the commonly named donor/acceptor interaction () since the bond is formed via a  σ donation from one of the four filled atomic orbitals of X− (np) towards the empty  σ* antibonding molecular orbital of X2. As X− formally approaches X2, the three lone pairs of the approached X atom of the X2 molecule are reoriented in order to be on the plane perpendicular to the bond direction when the symmetric three-body system X3− is formed. It corresponds to the rearrangement of a sp3 carbon atom during a nucleophilic attack in an SN2 type reaction (). The substantial difference between a trihalide and a penta-coordinated carbon resides in their different stabilities: while the penta-coordinated carbon represents a transition state, which finds its stabilization by removing one of the two apical groups so to allow the carbon to return to an sp3 hybridization, X3− is a stable species. In
such systems, the counting of the electrons around the central halogen and carbon atoms agrees very well with the notation by Arduengo et al. [] (10-X-2 and 10-C-5, resp.). In fact, since the starting diatomic species (X2 in the case of trihalides formation) obeys to the octet rule, every interaction with a donor (X− in the case of trihalides formation) implies a transfer of electron density on X2, thus formally
justifying a number of electrons higher than 8 on the central atom of the resulting three-body system.

The simplified donor/acceptor first approximation MO diagram for the formation of a trihalide species () becomes more complicate if the donor atomic orbital of X− (np) is combined with both the σ* and the σb MOs of X2. The result is a second approximation MO diagram having three new energy levels for the adduct, coming from the combination of these three orbitals (). 

The difference between the first and second approximation MO diagrams (Schemes  and ) resides in the nature of the first two MOs of the formed three-body system. In fact, the energy mixing in the second approximation diagram () has the consequence of increasing the bonding nature of the lowest MO, moving the intermediate MO to higher energies
towards a nonbonding nature. Now we can compare the 3c-4e bond model ()
with the two MO diagrams for the donor/acceptor interaction between X− and X2
(Schemes  and ) to describe the chemical bond in X3− anions. Since in all the three schemes, the highest MO is always an antibonding molecular orbital featuring a nodal plane between each couple of atoms, the differences between
these models are mainly determined by the different nature of the lowest two
molecular orbitals. According to the 3c-4e model, the stabilisation of
electron-rich (22 shell electrons) three-body systems has to be ascribed only
to the filling of the lowest MO, with a consequent bond order of 0.5 for each
of the two bonds formed. According to the charge-transfer model, involving only
the combination of a lone pair of X− with the σ* MO of X2, the filling up of the lowest energy level corresponds to a bond order of 1 within the X2 fragment, while the filling up of the intermediate level accounts for the bond formation between
the two interacting fragments and for a lengthening of the X−X bond in X2: a
bond order of 0.5 for both bonds is reached in the symmetric situation X−X−X−.
In the second approximation charge-transfer MO diagram (), the lone pair of X− combines with both σb and the σ* MOs of X2, consequently the bonding nature of
first molecular orbital of the resulting three-body system is increased, and
that of the second energy level is decreased, thus making this MO diagram
intermediate between the 3c-4e and the first approximation charge-transfer MO
diagrams (Schemes , , and ).

2. DISCUSSION
The two bonding models (3c-4e and charge-transfer
models) can be successfully employed to describe the chemical bond in numerous
linear three-body systems featuring 22 shell electrons, formed by three aligned
main group elements. The 3c-4e model describes linear three-body systems
(electron-rich linear systems) in terms of interacting aligned closed-shell
fragments; the stabilization is reached by removing a couple of electrons in
order to leave unfilled the highest MO ().  shows the combination of three p orbitals lying at the same level of energy; in a more general scheme with different starting closed-shell fragments, the combined p orbitals lie at different energy levels with
the consequence that they will contribute differently to each molecular orbital in the resulting three-body system. In particular, if the combined p orbital of one of the two external atoms lies at an energy level quite different from that of the p orbitals of the other two atoms, its contribution to the bonding MO will be poor with a consequent unbalancing of the two bonds. This case is normally better described with the charge-transfer
model, which corresponds to the interaction between a donor and a 2c-2e bond
system.

Another aspect that we must consider is the total charge brought by the final three-body system; it will depend only on the charges of the starting aligned closed-shell species. A very simple example is represented by the formation of the XeF2 molecule according to a 3c-4e model: the three-closed shell species to be considered are 2 F− and Xe; by removing a couple of electrons the neutral XeF2 molecule is generated. When three equal or different X− (X− = halide) are aligned, the resulting three-body system will be a trihalide monoanion.

The situation is much more complex for the formation of three-body systems from closed-shell species of 16th group elements, since the closed-shell species which can be combined can be both charged (E2−, R–E−)
and neutral (R2E and R=E, R = organic framework and E = chalcogen atom). In general, the alignment of three identical chalcogen species can afford three-body systems featuring very
different charges, (a)–(d) in .

In principle, any combination of E2−, R–E−, R2E, and
R=E species is possible, thus strongly increasing the variety of obtainable
three-body systems. In addition, the central chalcogen atom of the three-body
systems (a)–(d) reported in  can be aligned in turn to one or two other couples of closed-shell chalcogen species to form, after removal of 1 or 2 couples of electrons, systems featuring two ((e)–(g) in ) or three orthogonal 3c-4e fragments, respectively. In this way we can explain the great variety of structural archetypes which contain a hypervalent chalcogen atom. The number of possible combinations further increases if mixed S, Se, and Te
systems are also taken into account (see below).

Analogously to asymmetric trihalides, many asymmetric trichalcogen and mixed dichalcogen/halogen and chalcogen/dihalogen systems can be successfully described using the same charge-transfer model as that used for asymmetric trihalides. According to this model three-body systems arise from the interaction between a donor species (halide or chalcogen) and an acceptor species (dihalogen, dichalcogen, or chalcogen-halogen).

Therefore, a trichalcogen arrangement derives from the n(E)→ σ*(E–E) interaction between one of the above-mentioned closed-shell chalcogen species acting as a donor and the empty σ* MO of a dichalcogen molecule acting as an acceptor. In the case of mixed halogen/chalcogen systems, depending on the starting species, different topologies of three-body systems can be obtained,
such as E−X−Y, X−E−Y, E−E−X, and E−X−E (E = chalcogen, X,Y = halogen), which correspond to the well-known charge-transfer adducts between chalcogen donors and
dihalogens (E−X−Y), “T-shaped” adducts of chalcogen donors (X−E−Y), dichalcogen molecules interacting with halides (E−E−X), and halogen(+) linearly coordinated
by two chalcogen donor molecules (E−X−E).

3. TRIHALIDES
The Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) has been
searched for discrete tr ihalides fragments contained in deposited crystal
structures; the results of the search are collected in .

The triiodides are the most numerous and the scatter
plot of the corresponding two I–I bond lengths is shown in .

The literature related to triiodides has been omitted here and we refer to the paper by Svensson and Kloo []. Although several data are
spread apart in the scatter plot,
the majority of them are concentrated in the region corresponding
to symmetric or weakly asymmetric triiodides. It is important to point out that
an analogous correlation is found for Br3−anions (see ) [–] while for other trihalides, such as ICl2− () [–] and IBr2−() [–],
the corresponding scatter plots show a much less evident correlation. The
structurally characterized Cl3− fragments [–] are less than Br3− and I3− ones, and no bond
length correlation diagram is presented for them. Except for the case reported
by Gorge et al. [] in which the two terminal
chlorine atoms have significant contacts with two nitrogen atoms, in the other
six reported structures containing the Cl3− anion the two bonds are differently elongated, being 2.144/2.419 Å the bond distances found in the more
asymmetric case (see ). The number of structurally characterized mixed trihalides featuring two different terminal halogens (I–I–Br− [–], I–I–Cl− [, ],
Cl–I–Br− [–]) is very small, and a
unique example of Cl–Br–Cl− is reported in the literature (Tables  and )
[]. Among the considered fragments, we wish to emphasize the structural changes occurring on changing one of the terminal halogen from Cl, to Br and to I. Consider, for example, the I–Cl bond length in different trihalides: d (I–Cl) increases on passing from the symmetric Cl–I–Cl− (mean value 2.53 Å) to Cl–I–Br−
(mean value 2.663 Å, ) and Cl–I–I− (mean value 2.889 Å, )
indicating an increase in the ionic character of this bond when the other terminal halogen changes from Cl to Br and to I. However, in all cases, the I–Cl bond lengths are strongly elongated with respect to the sum of the covalent
radii (2.39 Å) [] but remain fairly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.73 Å) []. The structural features of I–I–Cl− and I–I–Br− () indicate that the bond distance of the central atom with the lighter halogen is always longer than the I–I distance, in accordance with a different ionic character of the two bonds. In terms of the
3c-4e model (), the p  orbitals of the two terminal halogens do not contribute equally to the three molecular orbitals of the three-body systems I–I–X− (X = Cl, Br, I). In fact, the p orbital of the terminal atom featuring the
better energy match with the p orbital of the central halogen will contribute
more to the bonding MO; vice versa, the other halogen will mainly contribute to
the nonbonding MO, thus carrying most of the negative charge. As a consequence,
the bond orders of the two bonds diverge from the value of 0.5, one increasing
towards the value of 1 (I–I), and the other decreasing towards the value of 0
(I–X). In terms of the charge-transfer model (), asymmetric trihalides of the type X–Z ⋯ Y− derive from the donor/acceptor interaction between the halide (Y−) and the acceptor species (X–Z); the strength of this interaction will depend on the reciprocal energy levels of the combining orbitals (p of the halide and  σ* MO of the dihalogen molecule).

However, in all trihalides, independently of the different polarization of the two bonds the sum of the bond lengths (dX−Z + dZ−Y) is always at least 9% longer than the sum of the covalent radii of the involved atoms, thus indicating a hypervalent state of the central halogen.

4. TRICHALCOGEN(IDE)S
 collects the occurrence of linear E–E′–E″ (E, E′, E″ = chalcogen atom) trichalcogen organic fragments found in structurally characterized compounds, as retrieved from a search of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) by imposing either the presence of two covalent bonds between the chalcogen atoms or the presence of one covalent bond and a nonbonding contact
shorter than ΣrVdW – 0.3 Å (E ⋯ E′–E″ and E–E′ ⋯ E″ fragments). In both
searches, the linearity of the fragment has been imposed (∠E–E′–E″ &gt; 165°).

As one can see, some combinations of trichalcogen
systems have never been reported and some others have been found only in a
limited number of structures ().

The scatter plots of d(E–E′) versus d(E′–E″) for all trichalcogen fragments present in numerous crystal structures are shown in Figures –.

Similar to what found for trihalides, linear trichalcogen systems can vary from symmetric to very asymmetric ones, but always feature strongly correlated d(E–E′)
and d(E′–E″)
bond lengths. This indicates that also in linear trichalcogen E–E′–E″ organic
fragments the potential energy hole should be fairly flat, being the chemical
surrounding of the chalcogen atoms and the crystal packing effects able to
freeze different structural situations. As mentioned above, in the case of 16th
group elements, different closed-shell chalcogen species can interact to afford
different types of linear trichalcogen systems (). However, since the
analysis of all linear trichalcogen systems would go beyond the aim of this
work, we will focus our attention only on some of them. When the closed-shell
species are three E2− anions, the corresponding three-body systems will be
E34−. Indeed, the linear Te34−, together with the “T-shaped” TeTe34−,
and the square-planar TeTe46− anions are considered fundamental building units of numerous polytellurides []. The Te–Te bond distances in such tellurides show elongation of about 13% with respect to the sum of the covalent radii and are typical for 3c-4e bonds []. A symmetric (Se3)4− ion was identified for the first time in the samarium/selenide cluster [{(C5Me5)Sm}6Se11] [], and considered a species
isoelectronic to I3−. The Se–Se bond length in this system (2.749  Å) is much longer than the mean bond length
in (Se2)2− species (2.37  Å). This was
justified by analogy with the couple I2/I3−. Linear [E–E ⋯ E]4− systems (E= S,Se) have been found in Mo and W clusters [, ] containing two [M3(μ3-E)(μ-E2)3
(dtc)3]+ cores (M = Mo, E = S, Se; M = W, E = Se) linked via an E2− anion;
these arrangements have been described as μ−E22− dichalcogenides interacting with E2− at significantly short distances. In the case of selenium clusters [], the two Se–Se bonds are 2.355  Å  and 2.816  Å  for the Mo cluster and 2.38 Å  and 2.93 Å  (mean values) for the W one, the short distances being only slightly elongated with respect to the Se–Se bond length in diselenides (2.34 Å). As found for strongly asymmetric trihalides, which are
better described as an X− anion interacting with an X2 molecule (X− ⋯ X2), the trichalcogen systems in which the two bonds assume very different bond
orders should be better described as a chalcogen donor (in the present case E2−) interacting with the σ* antibonding molecular orbital of a dichalcogen species [n(E) → σ*(E–E), in the present case E22−]. In other words, the interaction should occur between a chalcogen donor and a 2c-2e dichalcogen bond system. In general, depending on the starting chalcogen donor and dichalcogen acceptor species, these trichalcogen systems can carry a variable charge, from negative values as in the above cases, up to 2+ when the donor species is a neutral molecule and the acceptor a dichalcogen dication.

Several monoanionic structures of the type (R–E)3−,
arising from three aligned R–E− anions, for example, (Ph–Te)3− [, ], or [(CN)Se–Se(Ph)–Se(CN)]−
[], have been reported. Numerous are the hypervalent chalcogen compounds deriving from a neutral species interacting with two negatively charged monochalcogenides such as the case of 2,5-bis(morpholino-N)-4a-phenyl-1,3a,6,6a-tetrahydro-1,6,6a-triselena-4aλ4-phospha-3,4-diazapentalene [], or from a chalcogenide(2−) interacting with neutral molecules to form 1 or more 3c-4e systems, as in the case of the tetrakis(N-methylbenzo
thiazole-2(3H)-selone)selenium(2+) dication reported by us in which two
orthogonal 3c-4e fragments are present []. Particularly interesting are the two organic compounds FIKYON [] and ZENJEH []
() containing the linear Se–Se–S arrangement. In fact, in both cases, the Se–Se bond is shorter than the Se–S one due to the poor energy match between the orbital of the central Se atom and that of the peripheral S atom. When the closed-shell species are S-, Se-, or Te-containing neutral molecules, dicationic species will be generated having the central atom in a hypervalent
state. Among these systems, those having three S–S–S aligned sulphur atoms
[–] have been found only in the class of the pincer-type
molecules, with the central sulphur able to bind or to move apart the terminal
ones by oxidation/reduction processes. It is noteworthy to observe that most of
the molecules belonging to the E−E′−E pincer-type arrangments and many other trichalcogen systems are fairly symmetric, even if examples of strongly
asymmetric situations are also numerous.

Although our discussion is limited to the structural features of linear trichalcogen fragments (various combinations of S, Se, and Te), we have also included in  the only known example of an organic dichalcogen dication system having a strong contact with an oxygen atom [, ]. X-ray analysis of this
dication confirmed the linear geometry of the O–Se–Se moiety (165°)
and an Se–Se bond (2.39 Å) which, similarly to what found in the above-described
Mo and W clusters [, ], is only slightly elongated with respect to an Se–Se bond in diselenides (2.34 Å). This compound represents a good example of a
hypervalent selenium compound having the two bonds strongly unbalanced (bond orders very far from the value of 0.5 expected for a balanced 3c-4e bond system). For this reason it resembles many other similar systems, such as the
adduct of N,N′-dimethylimidazoline-2-selone with the pseudo-halogen ICN recently reported by us (see below in the last section); in both cases, one of the bonds tends to be a single bond, while
the other bond is very elongated and tends to assume a purely ionic character.

5. DICHALCOGEN-HALIDES
Two chalcogen and one halogen atoms as closed-shell
species can be aligned in only two possible ways: the halogen in the terminal
(E−E′−X) or in the central (E−X−E′) position. Both arrangements are known and they
will be discussed separately.

5.1. E−E′−X fragments
 shows the number of linear E−E′−X fragments
crystallographically characterized from a search of the Cambridge Structural
Database, by imposing the linearity of the system (∠E−E′−X
angle &gt; 165°)
and either the presence of two covalent E−E′ and E′ – X bonds or the presence of
one E−E′ covalent bond and one E′ ⋯ X nonbonding contact shorter than ΣrVdW– 0.3 Å.

It is interesting to note that in the case of the S–S–X
fragment (X = Cl, Br, I) the number of structures characterized by the presence
of a linear S–S ⋯ X moiety is considerably higher than that featuring the S–S–X one
(17 versus 4). Fragments having fairly covalent bonds have been found
exclusively as part of some molybdenum clusters [, , , , –]. These clusters are very similar to those previously
described in the discussion of trichalcogenides species, with the difference
that the halide takes the place of the bridging E2− anion. On the basis of
their insolubility in water and their solubility in the common organic
solvents, the authors concluded that the S–X bonds should be prevalently
covalent in character. In fact, their structural features seem to be consistent
with the presence of an [S–S–X]3− anion, deriving from the removal of a couple
of electrons from the aligned S2−, S2−, and X− closed-shell species. The sum
of the S–S and S–X bond lengths in these fragments is about 23% longer than the
sum of the covalent radii and about 31% shorter than the sum of the van der
Waals radii, in agreement with a 3c-4e bond model. The scatter plots of d(S–S)
versu d(S–X)
for both S–S–X and S–S ⋯ X (X = Cl, Br, I) fragments are shown in Figures ,  and 

It appears very clear from the figures that the
points  (♦) related to the S–S–X fragments are not enough to
establish the existence of a correlation between the two bond distances, and
those (∘) related to the S–S ⋯ X fragments do not fit any
correlation, since the S–S bond distances range in a very small interval of
values around 2.05 Å (1.02 Å is the covalent radius of S), and the S ⋯ X contacts
in a very wide interval of distances. These observations are more consistent
with a description of these systems as deriving from donor/acceptor
interactions between one of the p orbitals of X− and the σ* antibonding MO on the S–S system. In these
systems the energy-match between the lone pair of X− and the σ* MO on S22− is very poor. The weak
interaction is reflected in the corresponding very low lengthening of the S–S
bond.

Numerous crystal structures have been reported in the
literature that feature linear S–Te–X (X = Cl, Br, I) systems (references are collected in ). Contrary to what found on searching the CSD for S–S–X
fragments, for these linear arrangements, almost all the fragments feature covalent S–Te and Te–X bonds (S–Te–X systems). Only one structure containing an S–Te ⋯ Cl [] moiety has been found by searching for S–Te ⋯ X systems [Σrcov − 0.6 &lt; d(T ⋯ X) &lt; (ΣrVdW − 0.3)]. As shown in Figures , , and , for these three series of compounds the two bonds are strictly correlated in wide ranges of variability.

The sum of S–Te and Te–X bond distances within these
three-body systems is 10.8%, 11.6%, and 7.3% longer than the sum of the
covalent radii for X = Cl, Br, and I, respectively, in good agreement with the
hypervalent nature of the central tellurium atom. The other mixed dichalcogen
fragments bonded to a halide, characterized by X-ray diffraction, are very few
and they are collected in .

Differently from S–S–X, the S–Se–X fragments have been
found in some dimeric structures with bridging halides [, ]. Also in these cases the
sum of the S–Se and Se–X bond lengths shows elongation (∼19%)
with respect to the sum of the covalent radii, and shortening (∼30%)
with respect to the sum of the van der Waals radii. A certain number of
structures characterized by the linear Se–Te–X system have also been found. It is
noteworthy that the S–Te and Se–Te bonds get shortened as the Te–X bond becomes
more ionic (on changing X from I to Br and to Cl, see the examples reported in
), their bond orders approaching the value of 1.

In the case of the chloroderivatives E–Te ⋯ Cl (E = S, Se, ), the S–Te and Se–Te bonds are only 0.077 Å and 0.080 Å longer than
the sum of the covalent radii, making the structural features of these
compounds similar to those of the fragments Se–Se ⋯ O [] and NC–Se ⋯ I (see below in
the last section). Finally, five structures containing the linear Te–Te–I arrangement
have been reported in the literature; two of them [] are inserted in molybdenum
clusters in a fashion similar to that found for the S–S–X and Se–Se–X groups, two
are arranged to form (Ph–Te–I)4 tetramers [, ] and only one, (Mes)2Te–Te(Mes)–I [], can be considered as
derived from the three aligned closed-shell Mes2Te, MesTe−, and I− species,
by the removal of a couple of electrons. The analysis of the structural
features of all these fragments is consistent with their description as
three-body systems, the central Te atom being hypervalent.

5.2. E–X–E′ fragments
 collects the structural features of all the linear
E–X–E′ (E, E′ = chalcogen atom; X = halogen) fragments found by searching the Cambridge Structural Database.

Systems of this type have been found with all the
three halogens (Cl, Br, and I), and all the fragments have the same chalcogen
(E = E′) atom at the two sides of the halogen; no mixed species (E≠E′) have been reported until now. Moreover,
from the data in  it is interesting to note that with the exception of
RIWDUW [] which is
polymeric and shows three different couples of fairly asymmetric Te–Cl bonds,
all the other compounds feature the two chalcogen atoms bound to the central
halogen in symmetric or only slightly asymmetric fashion, and most of the
angles are very close to 180°. In all cases, the lengthening of the E–X bond with respect to the sum of the
covalent radii (the mean S−I bond length calculated from the structural data of
all six compounds characterized by the S−I−S group is elongated of about 17%),
the shortening with respect to the van der Waals radii (the mean S−I bond length
is shortened by ∼ 30%) and the linearity of the systems are consistent with the hypervalency of the
central atom.

6. CHALCOGEN-DIHALIDES
Analogously to dichalcogen-halides, there are only two
possibilities to build chalcogen-dihalides moieties: the chalcogen can be in
the terminal (E–X–Y) or in the central (X–E–Y) position. These two arrangements
correspond to the well-known CT and “T-shaped” adducts between chalcogen
donors and dihalogens, respectively, and will be discussed separately.

6.1. E–X–Y fragments
For a more detailed discussion on this class of
compounds the reader is referred to the review by Lippolis and Isaia []. The number of linear E–X–Y
CT fragments crystallographically characterized from a search on the Cambridge
Structural Database is reported in .

As one can see most of the adducts are obtained
between sulphur donors (D) and diiodine, on the contrary, no compounds of this
type are known with Te donors (the only reported structures featuring a Te–I–I
arrangement are characterized by long I ⋯ I contacts). The nσ(D)→σ*(XY)
charge-transfer model accounts very well for the chemical bond in these E–X–Y
systems.  can be easily adapted to any type of donor/acceptor couple
[with the substitutions of n p with nσ(D)
and σ*(X2)
with σ*(XY)],
bearing in mind that each couple will have a proper match of energy between the
interacting orbitals. We will focus our attention on the adducts between sulfur
donors and I2, since for them it is possible to fine tune the lone pair energy
of the donor atom by changing its chemical surrounding; therefore any type of
adduct from very weak to extremely strong can be obtained. In the case of very
weak interactions, each fragment holds its identity with a small reciprocal
perturbation; the effect of such perturbation on the halogen molecule consists
in the lowering to some extent of its bond order. In terms of the simplified MO
diagram reported in , weak adducts correspond to a poor energy match
between the interacting nσ(D)
and σ*(I2)
MO orbitals. Most of adducts between sulfur compounds and I2 belong to the
class of weak adducts. Since the stabilization of the adduct only depends on
the in-phase combination of the interacting orbitals, which is bonding between
the donor atom and the central iodine, and antibonding between the two iodine
atoms, the two bond lengths are strictly correlated and a shortening in the D ⋯ I
bond distance is accompanied by a lengthening in the I–I one. Without doubt, such
types of adducts must be considered two-coordinate hypervalent compounds of
iodine, like I3−. However, there is a substantial difference between an I3−
and a D–I–I system; while in the case of I3− the introduction of an asymmetry,
by increasing removal of one terminal iodine as I−, generates in the limit
case a strongly asymmetric I− ⋯ I2 system, in the case of the charge-transfer
adducts, two different asymmetric systems can be generated depending on which
bond, D ⋯ I or I ⋯ I, is the weakest one. They correspond to two different
charge-transfer adducts: nσ(D)→σ*(I2)
and nσ(I−)→σ*(I–D).
It is possible to pass almost continuously from a balanced situation with the
two bonds having a bond order value of about 0.5 [10-I-2 “hypervalent system”
for analogy to I3−], to the two different limit cases in which one bond
assumes an increasingly ionic character. Consequently, also these limit cases
featuring a strong asymmetry between the two bonds must be included among the
10-I-2 hypervalent compounds D–I+ ⋯ I− and D ⋯ I–I.

The scatter plot of d(S–I) versus d(I–I)
relative to all the reported adducts between sulphur donors and diiodine is
reported in .

Apart for some dispersion of the data, which was also
found for the other examined three-body systems, it clearly appears that the
two bond lengths are strictly correlated in a wide range of values. Similar correlations have been found in the case of adducts of selenium donors with diiodine () and sulfur donors with IBr (), well represented in the literature. Due to
the paucity of experimental data, no correlation is evident in the analogous
scatter plots for the linear adducts of chalcogen donors with the other
dihalogen/interhalogens molecules, including the case of d(Te–I)
versus d(I ⋯ I). The structural features of less common linear adducts between chalcogen
donors and dihalogen/interhalogens molecules are collected in .

6.2. X–E–Y fragments
This arrangement corresponds to the well-known
“T-shaped” adducts between chalcogen-donors and dihalogens. The numbers of
linear X–E–Y fragments crystallographically characterized and found by searching
the Cambridge Structural Database are reported in .

While all the dihalogens/interhalogens combinations with selenium and tellurium have been reported in the literature, only few X–S–X moieties (X = Cl, Br)7, and no X–S–Y  (X ≠ Y =
halogen atoms) arrangemets with sulphur as central atom are known. Indeed, sulphur donors show a preference to form linear charge-transfer type arrangement with the halogens (), absolutely unknown for the tellurium donors. Since several types of linear X–E–Y fragments are very numerous, the
corresponding structural data are given as scatter plots of the two X–E and E–Y
bond lengths (Figures , , , , and ).

As one can see, there is a high dispersion of points
in the scatter plots; however, in all the analyzed three-body systems the two
bond lengths can be considered correlated and both strongly asymmetric and
symmetric fragments can be found.

In , the structural features of less common
X–E–Y fragments are reported; there are six examples of hypervalent chalcogen
atoms bonded to two different halogen atoms, and, as already said, none of them
features a central sulphur atom. It is interesting to note that in such systems
the bond between the chalcogen and the lighter halogen is much more elongated
with respect to the sum of the covalent radii (more ionic bond) than that
involving the heavier halogen. In SUSMIC and in IDAZUI, Se–Cl and Se–Br are even
longer than Se–Br and Se–I, respectively.

7. CHALCOGEN · XCN (X = HALOGEN) ADDUCTS
As reported before, we wish also to consider in this
discussion “T-shaped” adducts obtained from the reaction between chalcogen
donors and pseudo-halogens X–CN (X=Cl, Br and I). Some compounds characterized
by X-ray diffraction analysis and featuring X–E–CN moieties (X = halogen, E =
chalcogen) are collected in .

The compound CYMIMB, reported by Arduengo and Burgess
[], has been
included in the table for its strict similarity with EZUZII, reported by us
[]. Both compounds
have a “T-shaped” arrangement around the chalcogen atom and are characterized
by very different E–X and E–CN bond lengths; the chalcogen-carbon bond is only sligthly
elongated with respect to the sum of covalent radii (bond order close to 1) and
the chalcogen-halogen bond is close to be a completely ionic bond. These
compounds closely resemble many asymmetric systems above decribed and in
particular the pincer-type molecule bearing the O ⋯ Se–Se group (). The
closeness of the chalcogen–CN and the Se–Se bond distances to the corresponding
single bonds, respectively, and the long chalcogen-halogen and selenium-oxygen
distances, strongly support the analogy between these two classes of compounds.
According to the 3c-4e model, the different energy levels of the three combined
 p orbitals (there is a good overlap between the
orbitals from E and C due to a good match of their energies) produce a bonding
MO having a small contribution of the  p orbital of the halogen, which vice versa
mainly contributes to the nonbonding orbital, thus carrying most of the
negative charge. In terms of the charge-transfer model, all the compounds of
this type can be properly described as originated by a very weak donation from
one halide orbital to the E–CN antibonding orbital (e.g., nσ(I−)→σ*(E–CN));
the weak interaction has the consequence of a small lengthening in the E–CN bond
distance, exactly as verified in numerous adducts between weak S donors and
diiodine.

8. CONCLUSION
On the basis of this overview on the structural
features of linear three-body systems, involving 16th and 17th group elements,
the following conclusions can be drawn.


The Rundle-Pimentel model for electron-rich 3-centre 4-electron systems and the
charge-transfer model represent two different approaches able to account for
the structural features of these linear three-body systems.

The Rundle-Pimentel model can be adapted to any set of three aligned atoms,
positioning the combining orbitals at the appropriate levels of energy.

Since three aligned closed-shell atoms can find stabilization only if two electrons are
removed from the system, ideally any type of sequence of atoms could be obtained.

The variability of starting molecules is reflected in the great variety of obtainable
structural archetypes. Since a starting molecule can be also a species
containing a hypervalent atom, its alignment with other closed-shell species
produces molecules in which two or three orthogonal 3c-4e systems are
simultaneous present. This is for example the case of anions such as Ph–SeBr4−
or SeBr62−.

The Rundle-Pimentel model very well accounts for the 0.5 bond order in symmetric
three-body systems since only the lowest MO contributes to the bond formation.
In addition, the Rundle-Pimentel model elegantly explains why the two terminal
atoms carry more negative charge (or less positive charge for positively
charged systems) even in the cases of three identical atoms [such as I3− or E(R2) E(R2)E(R2)2+ dications].

In these three-body systems, the energy match between the  p orbital of the central atom and those of the terminal ones influences the polarization of the formed bonds. This is very important for systems having different terminal atoms: each  p orbital will contribute differently to the three molecular orbitals with the consequence of an increased unbalance of the two bonds as the electronegativity difference between the involved elements
increases. In such cases, the bond orders of the two bonds diverge from the
value of 0.5, one approaching the value of 1 and the other that of 0.

  The strict analogy among all these systems, including the strongly asymmetric ones as the
“T-shaped” adduct between the N,N′-dimethylimidazoline-2-selone
and ICN, supports the hypervalent nature of the selenium atom in this compound
in spite of the fact that the bond orders of the two bonds are very different.

The charge-transfer model explains very well all the very asymmetric systems since
this model corresponds to the interaction of two stable fragments (as a
dihalogen molecule with a halide, or as chalcogen donor with a dichalcogen dication).

The energy match between the interacting orbitals of the two fragments (such as a hybrid
orbital of the donor and the σ* antibonding molecular orbital of the acceptor) determines the entity of the interaction.

In the CT model, the bond order of 0.5 for the two bonds is reached when the interacting
orbitals are at the same level of energy. This corresponds to the introduction
of 1 electron on the σ* MO of the acceptor, with the consequent
reduction of the bond order from 1 to 0.5.

An aspect to be emphasized is the fact that in all the structures of these families of
compounds, including the very asymmetric systems, the three-body system is
always linear, with angles generally larger than 170° .
The directionality of the bond is maintained also in presence of strongly
unbalanced bonds indicating a valuable contribution of covalence, due to the nσdonor → σ*acceptor charge-transfer interaction and supporting the
hypervalent character of the central chalcogen atom, independently on the
entity of the asymmetry.

Finally, it is interesting to observe that with only few exception, the systems having
different terminal atoms (see, e.g., trihalides X–Z–Y with X≠Y or trichalcogenides E−E′−E″ with E≠ E″) are less common than the symmetric ones.




1However, in the construction of the simplified MO diagram for the donor/acceptor interaction
(first approximation; ), the combination of the donor orbital with only the σ* MO of X2, leaving unchanged the σb level, is justified fairly well by a good
match of energy between the lone pair of X− and the σ* MO of X2.

2In the case of 17th group elements, not only X−but also R′ − X (R′ represents a generic fragment featuring whichever element bonded to the halogen such as C–X, P–X,…) closed-shell species could be considered in the formation of three-body
systems; however, these cases are not considered here in order to limit the discussion.

3As an exception, we will also consider the pseudo-halogens X–CN (X= halogen atom, see below in the last section).

4Only covalent bonded linear X–Y–Z fragments (angles &gt; 165°)
have been considered in subsequent analyses.

5A discussion on the factors responsible for
the spreading of some data out of the correlation in  is out of the aim of this work.

6The points having the S–I distance higher than 3.0 Å refer to quite different systems having the diiodine molecule bridging two donor molecules.

7 A peculiar case is represented by a byproduct of the
reaction between the neutral dithiolene [Pd(Et2timdt)2] (Et2timdt = formally
monoreduced diethylimidazolidine-2,4,5-trithione) and an excess of bromine,
[(Et2timdt)Br]2+2(Br−)2 ⋅  (Br2)3, containing two [L–S–Br]+
thione-bromosulfanyl cations []. We described this compound as ionic couples formed
by the organic framework bearing a double positive charge and the two terminal
S–Br bonds, and the two Br− ions which are positioned next to the sulfur atoms
to afford two very asymmetric linear Br–S Br moieties. The strong asymmetry is Br moieties. The strong asymmetry is
determined by several contacts between the Br− and Br2 molecules. Thus, each
Br− lies in a pseudo-octahedral environment determined by four Br2
molecules and two S–Br groups all acting as acceptors of the Br− electron
density. It is interesting to note that the Br2 molecules are so firmly held
in the crystal that after one year at room temperature and at air the crystals
were unchanged without loss of bromine. The great stability of the Br2
molecules within the crystal lattice can be explained in terms of donor/acceptor
interaction between Br− and six σ* antibonding molecular orbitals of four Br2 molecules and two S–Br terminal groups. This type of linear interaction np(Br−) → σ*(Br2) is different from that observed in the solid Br2 or I2 where the halogen molecules interact each other at 90° through a π*(X2) → σ* (X2) donation (X = Br, I).

(a)The angle values are rounded off to the first decimal. (b)Polymorphs.
(c)This is the unique example of CT type adduct between a selenium donor with bromine:
the formation of a Br–Se–Br group determines very favorable electronic and steric
effects to prevent the formation of the same arrangement on the second selenium
atom and to promote the CT type adduct. It must be noted that the Se ⋯ Br
interaction is enough weak to determine a lengthening of the Br–Br bond of only
0.078 Å.

(a)This compound has not been found searching the Cambridge Structural Database, but
has been included in the table for the strict similarity with EZUZII. In
CYMIMB, the shorter S ⋯ Br distance (3.270 Å) is that of the bromide in trans position with respect to the pentaatomic ring of the donor and not to the CN
group.
