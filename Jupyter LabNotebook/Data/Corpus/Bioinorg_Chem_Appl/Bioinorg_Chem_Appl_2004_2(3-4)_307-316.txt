GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
The complex [Co(NO3)(PyTT)2(H20)]NO3 has been isolated and characterized by single crystal X-ray
diffraction, IR spectroscopy, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The
environment around the cobalt atom may be described as a distorted octahedral geometry with the metallic
atom coordinated to two thiazoline nitrogens, two imino nitrogens, one oxygen atom of a nitrate group
monodentate and the oxygen atom ofa water molecule.

INTRODUCTION
Research interest in thiazoline and thiazolidine derivatives has increased during recent years, due to their
biological and pharmaceutical activity. 2-thiazolines have been synthesized for many years and they are
especially interesting because this heterocycle can be easily converted into thiazole or penicillin derivatives.
A lot ofnew synthetic compounds have emerged due to investigation for improving their therapeutic effect.
It has been proposed that penicillin inhibits the formation of bacterial cellular wall by acting as a
structural analog of the terminal D-alanyI-D-alanine residue of the peptidoglycan strand. It is suggested,
therefore, that the transpeptidase would first react with the substrate to form an acyl enzyme intermediate,
with the elimination of D-alanine, and that this active intermediate would then react with another strand to
form the cross-link and regenerate the enzyme. The penicillin fits the substrate-binding site with the 13-1actam
ring in the same position as the bond involved in the transpeptidation. It therefore acylates the enzyme,
forming a penicilloyl enzyme, and thereby inactivates it/1/. In this mechanism, metallic ions might act as
catalysts in the field of the coordination chemistry, because in the formation of substrate-enzyme complex
metallic ions might provide all or some binding sites through formation of an intermediate enzyme-metal-
substrate type bridge complex.
Likewise, many of these compounds containing thiazoline and thiazolidine rings present antitumoral/2/,
anti-HIV /3/ and antiinflammatory activity/4/, as well as being known for their application in the treatment
of diabetes/5/. However, the biological activity could be modified or even improved thanks to coordination
to metallic ions or atoms.
The synthesis of new siderophore analogues constitutes another example of pharmacological application.
Microbial siderophores are relatively low molecular weight compounds synthesized in order to solubilize and
transport iron (Iii) into the procariotes cells in the necessary concentrations/6/. New siderophore analogues
are prototypes for the synthesis of chelating agents employed for clinical use/7/. Thus, siderophores have
been characterized containing thiazoline rings as desferrithiocin or pyochelin. These compounds have been
used in the treatment of acute iron poisoning and in the chronic iron overload resulting from transfusion
theraphy of 13-thalasemia/8/. Likewise, some siderophores form strong chelates with other metal ions like
copper(ll), nickel(ll), zinc(ll) /9/, calcium(ll), magnesium(ll) and cobalt(ll) /6/. The research on new
siderophores will conduct to new clinical drugs for certain metal detoxification/10/.

For the reasons given above, in recent years we have been investigating the coordination chemistry of
compounds containing these heterocycles /11-13/. As part of this study, we report here the synthesis and
characterization of the cobalt(If) complex [Co(NO3)(PyTT)2(H20)]NO3 [PyTT 2-(2-pyridyl)imino-N-(2-
thiazolin-2-yl)thiazolidine].
EXPERIMENTAL
Ligand
The ligand 2-(2-pyridyl)imino-N-(2-thiazolin-2-yl)thiazolidine (PyTT) was prepared according to a
procedure reported elsewhere/14/taking into account published modifications/15/and recrystallized from
cyclohexane. Anal. Found: C, 49.97; H, 4.58; N, 21.19; S, 24.65. Calc. for ClH2N4S2: C, 49.94; H, 4.49; N,
21.15; S, 23.65%.
Preparation of [Co(NO3)(PyTT)2(H20)]NO3
This was obtained by reacting an ethanol-water solution of Co(NO3)2.6HzO (111 mg, 0.38 mmol) with
another ethanol-water solution of PyTT (100 mg, 0.38 mmol). The slow evaporation ofthe solvent yields red
monocrystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (112 mg, 40%). Anal. Found: C, 35.60; H, 3.24; N, 18.78; S,
16.88. Calc. for C2zHz6CoNI007S4: C, 36.21; H, 3.59; N, 19.18; S, 17.58%.
Instrumental procedures
Chemical analyses of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur were performed by means of
microanalytical methods using a Leco CHNS-932 microanalyser. A UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectrum in the
200-1000 nm range was obtained from a pellet of the sample, using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC
spectrophotometer and BaSO4 as a reference. Magnetic measurements were made at room temperature on a
magnetometer with pendulum MANICS DSM8, equipped with helium continous-flow cryostat and an
electromagnetometer DRUSCH EAF 16 UE. IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer FT-IR 1720
spectrophotometer, from KBr pellets in the 4000-370 cm1
range and on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR 1700X
spectrophotometer, from polyethylene pellets in the 500-150 cm range.
Crystal structure determinations
Crystal data, data collection and refinement details are given in Table 1. The first 50 frames were
recollected at the end of data collection to monitor for decay. Absorption and incident beam corrections were
applied using the SADABS program/16/. The structure was solved by direct methods and subsequent Fourier
differences using the WINGX package/I 7/and refined by full-matrix least-squares. All non-hydrogen atoms
were refined anisotropically. The hydrogen atoms were placed in their ideal positions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The analytical results agree with the molecular formula C22H26CoNI007S4 for the red Co(ll) complex.

The X-ray study revealed that the crystals of [Co(NO3)(PyTT)2(H20)]NO3 are made up of triclinic units
cells, containing [6(NO3)(PyTT)2(H20)]+
cations and nitrate anions. Figure shows the molecular structure
ofthe cation complex. The most relevant bond lengths and angles are given in Table 2.

The environment around the cobalt(ll) atom may be described as a distorted octahedral geometry with the
ligand-metal-ligand bite angles varying between 84.07(8) [N(7)-Co-O(I)] and 98.66(8) [N(3)-Co-N(7)].
The metallic atom is coordinated by two thiazoline nitrogens [av. Co-N 2.067 A], two imino nitrogens [av.
Co-N 2.122 A], one oxygen atom ofthe nitrate group monodentate [Co-O(l)-- 2.249(2) A] and the oxygen
atom of the water molecule [Co-O(IW) 2.105(2) A]. This compound is the second structurally
characterized compound having a 2-thiazoline link to cobalt(ll) /12/, being, moreover, the first with an
octahedral geometry. The Co-O(IW) bond length is similar and comparable to the calculated average value
[2.134(99) A] for 45 crystal structures with an octahedral cromophore group CoN402 obtained from the
Cambridge Structural Database System(CSD). Likewise, the Co-N(imino)distances [Co-N(3)- 2.113(2) A;

Co-N(7) 2.130(2) A] are in good agreement with the mean value calculated using the data of 28 crystal
structures obtained from CSD. However, the Co-O,itate bond distance [Co-O(l) 2.249(2) A] is longer that
the mean value 2.109(40) A calculated from the data of 33 crystal structures of octahedral Co(II) complexes
collected in the CSD.

The six-membered chelate ring Co-N(I)-C(1)-N(2)-C(4)-N(3) shows a conformation near to half-chair,

C(1)-N(2)-C(4). This geometry is proved by the puckering parameters Q 0.170/, 329.1 and 0 49.7
calculated according to Cremer and Pople/18/. Therefore, the chelate ring Co-N(5)-C(12)-N(6)-C(15)-N(7)
presents a conformation near to half-chair [Q 0.295/,; 332.4; 0 58.4], with Co y N(7) deviating
0.266 and 0.220/ below and above, respectively, the N(5)-C(12)-C(15)-N(7) mean plane. In the organic
ligands, the values of the puckering parameters for the thiazoline and thiazolidine rings calculated according
to Cremer and Pople/18/, are:
Ring A: [S(1)-C(I)-N(I)-C(2)-C(3)]
Ring B: [S(3)-C(12)-N(5)-C(13)-C(14)]

q2 0.290/; 317.2;
q2 0.347 .; 318.9;
qz 0.387/; 324.1 o;
These values indicate that four rings show a conformation near to envelope with the apexes at C(3),
C(I4), C(6) and C(17), respectively.
As in other PyTT complexes/11,12/, the organic moiety preserves the imino-thiazolidine form detected in
the structure of PyTT. However, a drastic change is observed in the conformation upon complexation. Thus,
the thiazoline rings are rotated around the C(1)-N(2) and C(12)-N(6) bonds, respectively, which permit the
donation through N(I) and N(5) [torsion angles S(1)-C(I)-N(2)-C(5) 11.9 and S(3)-C(12)-N(6)-C(16)
13.7 in the complex; 176.5 in PyTT]. Similarly, the rotation angles of the pyridine rings around the C(7)-
N(3) bond [torsion angle C(4)-N(3)-C(7)-N(4)= 68.8] and C(18)-N(7) bond [torsion angle C(15)-N(7)-
C(18)-N(8) 54.0] are higher than in PyTT (16.9) which decreases the steric interaction between both
ligands ofthe cation complex.
The presence of hydrogen bonds is observed. Thus, the water molecule of coordination acts as donor of
hydrogen, while oxygen atoms 0(4) ofnitrate ion and 0(2) ofnitrate ligand monodentate act as acceptors.
Physical measurements
The observed molar magnetic susceptibility for [Co(NO3)(PyTT)2(H20)]NO3 was corrected for
diamagnetism and temperature-independent paramagnetism to provide the fully corrected magnetic moment
at room temperature (la 5.0 BM). This value is consistent with the octahedral environment around cobalt(ll)
/19/.
The diffuse reflectance spectrum shows one intense band at 31250 cm-, which is indicative of one
charge-transfer transition. Moreover, the spectrum exhibits two broad bands with considerable fine structure
that have intensities consistent with spin-allowed d-d transitions. These bands may be assigned as:
v[4Tg(F)-- 4T2g(F)](lI340, 8320, 5870 cm-) and v3[4Tg(F)-- 4Tg(P)](19230 cm") transitions, in an
idealized O symmetry. The ligand field parameters, 10 Dq and B, were calculated from the averaged values
of the v and v3 bands taking the centre of gravity of the total intensity/20/, using the following known
relationships/21/for octahedral d complexes:
vI[4Tg(F)--4Tzg(F)] 1/2(10Dq- 15B) + l/2[(10Dq + 15B)2- 12B.10Dq]/2
vs[4Tg(F)---4Tg(P)] l/2[(10Dq + 15B) 12B. 10Dq]/2

The calculated values of the ligand field parameters 10Dq 9220 cm
-and B 770 cm
-are in fair
agreement with the predicted values for octahedral complexes and are consistent with the .presence of a
cromophere group [CoN402]/22-24/.
The IR spectrum in the 4000-370 cmt
region shows the presence of bands due to the thiazoline ring
vibrations at 1590 (Wt), 947 and 895 (W3), 815 (W4), 754 and 740 (W.s), 646 (W6), 533 (W7), 598 (W8), 445
and 434 cm-t
(F)/25/. Likewise, the spectrum exhibits bands assignable to thiazolidine ring vibrations at
1028 (v), 947 (v2), 883 and 839 (v3), 704 (V4) 687 and 635 (vs), 582 and 571 (3), 514 and 495 cm (52)
/26,27/. Moreover, characteristic bands of pyridine ring vibrations are detected at 1573 (8a), 1551 (8b), 1465
(19a), 1433 (19b), 651 (6b), 624 (6a) and 411 (16b) cm/28,29/.
Other relevant bands are registered at 3500 and 3425 (v 42o ), 1618 [Vtc=N)imi,,e] and 1124 cm
-[Vtc-N)] /30/.
In the 1700-1800 cm region ofthe IR spectrum, the pattern of the v+v4 combination bands was studied.
The value of the vt+v4 splittings (A 33 cm) indicates, according to Lever's criteria/31/, the presence of
one monodentate nitrate group. Likewise, a third peak was observed in this region, which allows to recoghize
a ionic nitrate group. Moreover, the IR spectrum shows other bands at 1288, 1028, 806, 721 and 704 cm
-that can be assigned to the monodentate nitrate group whereas the bands at 1380 and 826 cm can be
assigned to the nitrate ion group [31-36].
Only four bands assignable to Co-ligand stretching vibrations are observed in the low frequency range,
although the C symmetry of the complex cation predicts the appearance of six such bands. The broad band
at 346 cm
-is assignable to the v(Co-OH2) mode of the coordinated water/22,37,38/, whereas the band at
324 cm is assigned to v(Co-Nimine), in good accord with literature/39-42/.
Finally, the bands at 270 and 223 cm
-are tentatively assigned to the v(Co-ONO2) /37,43,44,45/ and to
v(Co-Nthiazoline) 12/, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS
From the structural study of this complex some conclusions can be drawn. First, it can be expected that
this complex presents little or no antimicrobial activity due to the fact that the complex is octahedral and
presents a complete coordination sphere/46/, which hinders the entry of new ligand to form the complex
enzyme-metal-substrate complex. Secondly, since cobalt intoxications induce cardiomyopathy, allergic
dermatitis and asthma/47/, it can be possible to use PyTT as siderophore for the treatment of poisoning with
this metal due to the formation ofa complex with chelate rings.
