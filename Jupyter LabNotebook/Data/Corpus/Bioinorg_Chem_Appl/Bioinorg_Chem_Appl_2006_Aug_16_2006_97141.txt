INTRODUCTION
Carrier-assisted transport through supported liquid membranes is
one of the important applications of supramolecular chemistry. The
designs of redox-switched crown ethers and lariat
ethers have been achieved by researchers [] in
90s.
Crowns are cyclic, introduced by Pedersen [] in
1967; podands are acyclic, discovered by Vogtle and Angew
Chem [] in 1979; and a new class of crown ethers
(combination of cyclic + acyclic) ionophores called lariat crown
ethers [], introduced by Gokel et al. Lariat ethers
synthesized for the present study have redox moiety and different
chain length of polyethers and have been used as a carrier in
facilitated transport of alkali and alkaline-earth metal ions
across supported liquid membrane (cellulose nitrate). We have
already reported [] isolation studies of main group
(Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+,
Mg2+) metal ions with redox-switched lariat ethers. The molecular architecture of lariat ether side arm holds the metal
ions, and selectivity and carrier ability of redox-switched lariat
ethers will be helpful in constructing ion-selective electrodes
[], redox-switchable devices [], and specific carrier in separation of metal cations. Study of physiological reactions will also be carried out.

EXPERIMENTAL
Synthesis of redox-switched lariat ethers
We have synthesized ionophores (M1–M6) as shown in .

Preparation of 1-[1-anthraquinonyloxy]-3, 6,
9-trioxaundecane-11-ol (M1)-
A solution of tetraethylene glycol (2.89 mL) in THF
(10 mL) was added to vigorously stirred suspension of NaH
(60% oil dispersion, 0.29 g, and 7.25 mmol) in THF and
the mixture was refluxed for 30 minutes. Then a solution of
1-chloroanthraquinone (1.28 g, 5.28 mmol in THF) was added
to it and refluxed at 80°C for 10 hours with stirring. This
reaction was performed under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction
mixture was concentrated and the residue was mixed with
CH2Cl2 and then washed with water (twice) followed by
brine. The organic phase was separated and dried (over MgSO4),
filtered, and concentrated. Column chromatography (silica gel,
2% MeOH/CH2Cl2) followed by recrystallization
(CH2Cl2/hexane then EtOH) gave 2.73 g (80%) of
ionophore M1 as a yellow solid.
Melting point is 52°C.

IR (KBr) ν – 3565(OH), 2940 cm−1(CH2),
2865 cm−1, 1685 cm−1(C=O),
1320 cm−1, 1270 cm−1(ArOCH2),
1140 cm−1.

1H NMR (δ in ppm) –3.25 –4.45 (m, 20 H,
OCH2), 7.20–8.35
(m, 7H, ArH).




Ionophores M2, M3, M4, M5,
and M6 were prepared in the same manner by taking triethylene glycol, diethylene glycol diethylene glycol monobutyl
ether, and triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol
monomethyl ether [], respectively ().

Chemicals
Metal salts as metal picrate (MPic) were prepared as reported
earlier []. The reagents used in the
synthesis of redox-switched ionophores
(M1–M6) were 1-chloroanthraquinone (Lancaster), sodium hydride (Merck Limited, Mumbai, India), and tetraethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,
diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, and
triethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl
ether (Fluka Chemika-BioChemika, Switzerland). The solvents
CHCl3, CH2Cl2, THF (Qualigen, Glaxo India Limited, Mumbai, India) were used as it is.

Preparation of membrane
Commercially available synthetic membrane Merck (cellulose nitrate) has been
used as a support in SLM studies. The membrane pore size was 0.2 μm.
Membranes were impregnated with redox-switched ionophores (M1–M6),
dipped overnight, and used as a membrane support. These impregnated
membranes were used for carrier-facilitated transport studies of alkali and
alkaline-metal cations. Electron microscope studies are under process
().

Carrier-mediated transport across supported liquid
membrane
 shows the apparatus for this study. The
supported liquid membrane [] was positioned between two cylindrical half-cells. One cell compartment (source phase)
contained an aqueous solution of the metal salt (50 mL) of
1 × 10−1 and the other cell contained the receiving phase
(50 mL) double distilled water separated by membrane having an
effective diameter of 1 cm. Both phases were stirred with
magnetic stirrer at 120 rpm at room temperature, the sample
was withdrawn from the receiving phase after 24 hours and analyzed
for sample using Systronics flame photometer
(Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+) and
UV-V is a spectrophotometer for Mg2+. Cation flux (JM)
values were calculated by using the relation []


where C is the concentration of cation in receiving phase in mol/dm3, V is the volume of receiving phase in dm3, A is the effective area of membrane in m2, and t is the time in seconds.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Transport studies of metal ion across SLM were carried out by
ionophores (M1–M6) using cellulose nitrate
membrane as a support. Blank experiments were also carried out for
transport studies of metal salts in which membrane was devoid of
carrier. No leakage of cation in the membrane was noted. The
optimum concentration of metal ion and ionophore was found to be
1× 10−1 M and 1×10−4 M, respectively
().

The trend for the transport of cations with ionophore M1
is Na+ ≫ Li+ &gt; K+ &gt; Ca2+ &gt; Mg2+.
Ionophore M1 having large tetraethylene glycol side chain with anthraquinone moiety shows maximum carrier
ability. This is due to their flexible long chain length and
additional donor sites for the interaction with all metal
(Li+, Na+, K+,
Ca2+, Mg2+) cations. The trend for ionophore
M2 is 
Li+ &gt;
Na+ &gt;
K+.
Ionophore M2 having triethylene glycol chain shows strong binding affinity with high-charge-density cations, so it
forms stable complexes with lithium. Therefore, it shows less
transport for K+, Na+, and no transport for
Ca2+, Mg2+. Ionophore M3 having
small diethylene chain shows transport for
Li+ &gt;
Na+ only because small flexible side arm
forms small pseudocyclic cavity by hydrogen bonding [].
Ionophore M4 having butyl group and M5,
M6 having methyl group shows order of transport for
metal ion as Li+ &gt;
Na+ &gt;
K+.

Cation selectivity depends on the particular end group, when the
end group is butyl, the ionophore M4 binds lithium in comparison to simple –OH group because conformational rigidity of
the supporting framework does play a crucial role in binding. The
conformation of side chain is such as to enclose the metal cation
and there is interaction between coordinating site of the
ionophore and the metal ion, as the end methyl group is not too
strong. From the results, it is clear that Mg2+ cation is not transported in sufficient amount by this ionophore
(M1–M6) due to its highest charge density.
Selectivity of ionophore M4 is shown at the bottom of .
Ionophore M6 having diethylene glycol monomethyl ether shows selectivity for Li+ due to cavity fit concept. Ionophore
(M1–M6) shows selectivity towards Li+ due to small
size and higher charge density of Li+ accounts for self-encapsulation [].

The results inform us that the metal ion transport mainly depends upon the
structure of the ionophores like number of donor sites, flexibility of chain
length, ionophore concentration, and also on the concentration, charge
density, and size of metal cation; and this molecular designing helps in
fabrication of redox-switchable devices, molecular wires, as well as chemical
sensors.
