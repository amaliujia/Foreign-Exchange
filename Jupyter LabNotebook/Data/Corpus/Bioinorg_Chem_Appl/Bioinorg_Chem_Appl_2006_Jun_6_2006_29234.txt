INTRODUCTION
Interest in the study of hydrazones has been growing because of
their antimicrobial, antituberculosis, and antitumour activity
[–]. 
Hydrazones derived from condensation of
isonicotinic acid hydrazide with pyridine aldehydes have been found
to show better antitubercular activity than INH [].
The remarkable biological activity of acid hydrazides
R−CO−NH−NH2, their corresponding
aroylhydrazones 
R−CO−NH−N=CH−R′, and
the dependence of their mode of chelation with transition metal
ions present in the living system have been of significant
importance in the past [–]. 
In view of the versatile importance of hydrazones, we
herein describe the synthesis and identification of the
Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes of
N-isonicotinamido-2′,4′-dichlorobenzalaldimine(INH-DCB)
().

EXPERIMENTAL
MX2 · nH2O 
 (M = Co2+ or
Ni2+; 
X = Cl−, 
Br−,
NO3− or 
CH3COO−) 
were obtained from SD Fine Chemicals Ltd (Mumbai, India) and were used as such:
M(NCS)2 
(M = Co2+ or 
Ni2+).
They were prepared by mixing metal chloride
(in ethanol) and ethanolic solution of potassium thiocyanate in
1 : 2 molar ratio. Precipitated KCl was filtered off and the
filtrate having respective metal thiocyanate was used immediately
for complex formation []. 
M(ClO4)2 
(M = Co2+ or 
Ni2+) were prepared by the
addition of an ethanolic solution of sodium perchlorate
to respective metal chloride solution. White precipitate
of NaCl was filtered off and the filtrate containg
M(ClO4)2 
was used as such for complex formation. The
ligand INH-DCB was synthesized in the laboratory by the following
method. Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) (0.01 mol)
was dissolved in 10 mL of 95% ethanol. To this
solution, 2,4-dichlorobenzaldehyde (0.01 mol) was added in
95% ethanol (10 mL). The mixture was refluxed on a
water bath for 1-2 hours. The partial removal of solvent on a
water bath followed by cooling produced crystalline product, which
was collected by filtration, washed with cold ethanol,
and dried under vacuum (yield 80%). The purity of the ligand
was checked by TLC, IR spectra, and melting point.

Synthesis of the complexes
A general method has been used for the preparation of all the
complexes. A hot ethanolic solution of the corresponding
cobalt(II) or nickel(II) salt was mixed with a hot ethanolic
solution of the ligand (in 1 : 2 or 1 : 3 molar ratio). The
reaction mixture was refluxed on water bath for about
2-3 hours. On cooling at room temperature, the coloured
complexes precipitated out in each case. They were filtered,
washed with ethanol and recrystallized, and dried over
P2O5 under vacuum.

Physical measurements and analytical estimations
The cobalt(II) and nickel(II) ions in their metal complexes were
estimated complexometrically with EDTA using murexide and
erichrome black-T as an indicator after decomposing the complexes
with concentrate H2SO4  and
H2O2 
[]. 
The halogens and thiocyanate were
estimated by Volhard's method []. 
The perchlorate was estimated by the method suggested by Kurz et al 
[]. The
nitrogen content was determined by Kjeldahl method. The molecular
weight of the complexes was determined in laboratory
cryoscopically in freezing nitrobenzene using a Beckmann
thermometer of ±0.01°C accuracy. The conductivity
measurements were carried out, at room temperature in
nitrobenzene, using a conductivity bridge and dip-type cell
operated at 220 volts AC mains. The magnetic measurements on
powder form of the complexes were carried out at room temperature
on Evans's balance using anhydrous copper(II) sulfate as
calibrant. The infrared spectra of the complexes were recorded on
a Perkin Elmer infrared spectrophotometer model Spectrum 1000 in
CsI in the range of 200–4000 cm−1. Diffused
reflectance spectra of the solid compounds were
recorded on a Beckmann DK-2A spectrophotometer at CDRI, Lucknow,
India. Thermogravimetric studies of the complexes were carried out
in static air with open sample holder and a small boat, the
heating rate was 6 °C/min.

Antibacterial activity was done by the paper-disc plate method.
The nutrient agar medium (peptone, beef extract, NaCl, 
and agar-agar) and 5 mm diameter paper discs (Whatman
number 1) were used. The compounds were dissolved in
DMSO in 500 and 1000 ppm concentrations. The filter paper
discs were soaked in different solutions of the compounds, dried,
and then placed in the petri dishes previously seeded with the
test organisms (Escherichia coli and 
Klebseila aerogenous). The plates 
were incubated for 24–30 hours at 28 ± 2°C and 
the inhibition zone around each disc was
measured. The antifungal activity was evaluated against
Fusarium oxysporum and Macrophomina phaseolina
using standard food poisoning technique and a procedure
recommended for testing new chemicals []. 
The linear growth of the fungus was recorded by measuring the diameter of the fungus
colony after 96 hours and the percentage inhibition was
calculated as 100 (C-T)/C, where  C and T are the diameters of
the fungus colony in the control and test plates, respectively.

Results and discussion
The reaction of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) salts with INH-DCB
results in the formation of MX2 · 
(INH-DCB)n [M = 
Co(II) or Ni(II); 
X = Cl−,
Br−, 
NO3−, 
NCS−,
or CH3COO−, 
n = 2; X = ClO4−, n = 3] (). All the complexes are quite stable and
could be stored for months without any appreciable change. The
complexes do not have sharp melting points but decompose above
250°C. These complexes are generally soluble in common
organic solvents. The conductance measurement indicates that the
chloro, bromo, nitrato, thiocyanato, and acetato complexes of
cobalt(II) and nickel(II) are essentially nonelectrolytes in
nitrobenzene, while the perchlorato complexes dissociate in
nitrobenzene and behave as 1 : 2 electrolytes []. 
The molecular weights determined cryscopically are in broad
agreement with the conductance data ().

Magnetic susceptibility
The observed magnetic moments of cobalt(II) complexes of INH-DCB
are given in . The theory of magnetic
susceptibility of cobalt(II) ion was given originally by
Schlapp and Penney [] and the best summary of
results on the magnetic behaviour of cobalt compound is that of Figgis and
Nyholm []. The observed values of magnetic moment
for cobalt(II) complexes are generally diagnostic
of the coordination geometry about the metal ion. The low-spin
square-planar cobalt(II) complexes may be 2.9 BM, arising
from one unpaired electron plus an apparently large orbital
contribution []. 
Both tetrahedral and high-spin octahedral
cobalt(II) complexes possess three unpaired electrons but may be
distinguished by the magnitude of the deviation of μeff 
from the spin-only value. The magnetic moment of tetrahedral
cobalt(II) complexes with an orbitally nongenerate ground term is
increased above the spin-only value via contribution from higher
orbitally degenerate terms and occurs in the range
4.2–4.7 BM []. 
Octahedral cobalt(II) complexes however maintain a large contribution due to 
4Tg
ground term and exhibit μeff in the range 4.8–5.6 BM 
[]. The magnetic measurements on the
complexes reported herein 4.7–5.1 BM show that all are
paramagnetic and have three unpaired electrons indicating a
high-spin octahedral configuration.

Magnetic behavior of octahedral nickel(II) complexes is relatively
simple. Nickel(II) has the electronic configuration 3d8 and should exhibit a magnetic moment higher than expected for two
unpaired electrons in octahedral (2.8–3.2 BM) and
tetrahedral (3.4–4.2 BM) complexes whereas its
square-planar complexes would be diamagnetic. This increase in the
magnetic moment value from that of the spin-only value has been
discussed by Nyholm [] 
who considered it to be due to some
“mixing in” of upper state via spin-orbit coupling. The
paramagnetism observed for the present series of complexes ranges
from 2.6–3.2 BM () which
is consistent with the octahedral stereochemistry of the complexes.

Infrared spectra
INH-DCB is expected to act as tridentate one, the possible
coordination sites being pyridinic-nitrogen, azomethine-nitrogen,
and amide group. A study and comparison of the IR spectra of
INH-DCB and its cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes imply that the
ligand INH-DCB is bidentate in nature with carbonyl-oxygen and
azomethine-nitrogen as two coordination sites. The IR-data are
presented in .

Generally, all amides show two absorption bands, (i) the carbonyl
absorption band near 1640 cm−1 known as amide-I band and
(ii) strong band in the 1500–1600 cm−1 region,
known as amide-II band. The origin of these bands in
hydrazones, that is, the carbonyl absorption responsible for the
amide-I band, is likely to be lowered [] 
infrequently by the NH group as in normal amides. 
The amide-I band in INH-derivative, however, 
appears at 1700 and 1655 cm−1 
[, ]. 
In the IR spectra of the complexes a considerable negative shift in 
ν(C=O) is
observed indicating a decrease in the stretching force constant of
C=O as a consequence of coordination through the
carbonyl-oxygen atom of the free base. The amide-II band appears
at the normal position in the NH-deformation rather
than the C−N link. In all the hydrazones, the
absorptions such as 1540, 1520 cm−1 have been
assigned to amide-II absorption. The NH stretching
absorption in free ligand occurs at ∼ 3300 and
3220 cm−1 [] 
which remains unaffected after complexation. This precludes the 
possibility of coordination through imine nitrogen atom.

Another important band occurs at ∼ 1585 cm−1
attributed to ν(C=N) (azomethine) mode
[–]. 
In spectra of all the complexes this band is
shifted to lower wave number and appears in
1525–1555 cm−1 region, respectively, indicating the
involvement of N-atom of the azomethine group in coordination
[–].

The strong bands observed at 1520–1575 cm−1
and 1000–1080 cm−1 are tentatively assigned
[, , 
] to asymmetric and symmetric
ν(C=C) + ν(C=N) of pyridine ring and
pyridine ring breathings and deformations remain practically
unchanged in frequency and band intensities revealing
noninvolvement of pyridinic-nitrogen and metal bond. The overall
IR spectral evidence suggests that the INH-DCB acts as bidentate
ligand and coordinate through amide-oxygen and azomethine-nitrogen
atoms forming a five-membered chelate ring. In the far
IR spectral region, the bands in the ligand are practically
unchanged in these complexes. However some new bands with medium
to weak intensities appear in the regions
395–505 cm−1 in the complexes under study,
which are tentatively assigned to
ν(M−O)/ν(M−N) modes 
[].

Anions
In both perchlorato complexes, the presence of the ν3 
	at ∼ 1100 cm−1 and 
ν4 at ∼ 625 cm−1 
bands indicates that the Td symmetry
of ClO4− is maintained in all the
complexes. This, therefore, suggests the presence of
ClO4− outside the coordination sphere in
the complexes [, 
, 
]. The CN stretching frequency
(ν1) is generally lower for M-SCN complexes than for M-SCN
complexes []. Bailey et al 
[] suggested the region
near or above 2100 cm−1 for S-bonding, below this for
N-bonding. The CS stretching frequency (ν2) 
was assigned in the following regions: 
780–860 cm−1 for M-SCN
and 690–720 cm−1 for M-SCN group 
[].
The NCS frequency (ν3) 
is also different for the two isomers 450–490 cm−1 
for the M-SCN and 400–440 cm−1 for M-SCN group 
[].
Bridging thiocyanate usually gives higher CN
stretching frequencies than terminal NCS group
[–]. 
In present thiocyanato complexes, three
fundamental absorptions C−N stretch
(ν1), C−S stretch (ν3), 
and N−C−S bending (ν2) 
are identified at ∼ 2050, 840, and 475, respectively. 
These frequencies are
associated with the terminal N-bonded isothiocyanate ions
[–]. 
The occurrence of two strong absorption bands in
both the nitrato complexes at ∼ 1500 and 1300 cm−1
are attributed to ν4 and ν1 
modes of vibrations of the covalently bonded nitrate groups, respectively. This suggests
that nitrate groups are present inside the coordination sphere
[, ]. 
If the (ν4 − ν1) 
difference is taken as an approximate measure of the covalency of nitrate group
[, ], 
a value of ∼ 200 cm−1  for the
complexes studied suggests strong covalency for the metal-nitrate
bonding. Devi et al [] 
have shown that the number and
relative energies of nitrate combination frequencies 
(ν1 + ν4) 
in the 1700–1800 cm−1 region of the
infrared spectrum may be used as an aid to distinguish the various
coordination modes of the nitrato group. According to
Agarwal et al [], 
bidentate coordination involves
a greater distortion from D3h symmetry than
unidentate coordination, therefore, bidentate complexes should
show a larger separation of (ν1 + ν4). 
By an investigation of the spectra of a number of compounds of known
crystal structure, Devi et al [] 
showed this to be true, the separation of monodentate nitrate groups appeared to be
5–26 cm−1 and that for bidentate groups
25–66 cm−1. The authors have tried to apply this method
to present complexes. In both cases, in all the nitrato
complexes, a separation of 15–25 cm−1 in the combination
bands (ν1 + ν4) in the
1700–1800 cm−1 region conclude the 
monodentate nitrate coordination.

The νasym 
(COO−) 
of free acetate ions are at
∼ 1560 cm−1 and 1416 cm−1, 
respectively. In the unidentate complex (structure a) ν(C=O) is
higher than νasym 
(COO−) 
and ν(C−O)
is lower than νasym 
(COO−). 
As a result, the separation between the two ν(CO) 
is much larger in unidentate complexes than that of free ion. The opposite
trend is observed in the bidentate complex, the separation between
the ν(CO) is smaller than that of free ion in this
case. In the bridging complexes (structure c), however, two
ν(CO) are close to the free ion values. The present
complexes show infrared absorption frequency bands corresponding
to νasym (COO−) 
and νsym
(COO−) at ∼ 1610 and 
1370 cm−1,
respectively. These observations indicate that both the acetate
groups in present complexes are unidentate [, 
].

Electronic spectra
Cobalt(II) complexes
The electronic spectra of all the present cobalt(II) complexes
recorded herein are very similar to each other and
consist of two bands one in the 15, 400–15, 500 cm−1
and the other in the 20, 500–20, 830 cm−1 regions,
which clearly indicate the octahedral stereochemistry of the
complexes. In , the band maxima and their
assignments and the calculated ligand field parameters are listed.
When all the bands, ν1, ν2, 
and ν3 are observed to be free from shoulders, 
the ligand field parameters
Dq and B 
are, in principle, calculated using first-order perturbation theory
[, 
] and the transition
energies are given by the following equations []:


The methods of calculation of ligand field parameters from the
ligand field spectra of octahedral Co(II) complexes have
been discussed by Reedijk et al []. 
The energy of ν1 corresponds to 
10Dq for weak field and the value of
Dq is obtained from it. With these assignments, 
B and Dq 
have also been observed ().

Nickel(II) complexes
The electronic spectra of all the complexes recorded herein are
very similar to each other and consist of three bands one at 
∼ 10 000 cm−1 due to 
3A2g → 
3T2g(ν1), 
∼ 16 000 cm−1 due to
3A2g → 
3T1g(ν2),
and ∼ 25 000 cm−1 for 
3A2g → 
3T2g(ν3) 
which clearly indicate the octahedral stereochemistry of the complexes. In
, the band maxima and their
assignments and the calculated ligand field parameters are listed
[–].

Thermal studies
The thermal results of Co(II) and 
	Ni(II) complexes of INH-DCB are briefed 
	in Tables  and 
	, respectively. Due to the
explosive nature of perchlorato complexes, we have investigated
only the thermal properties of chloro, bromo, and nitrato
complexes.All the complexes are thermally stable up to
165°C. After that deligation process started and in
temperature range 165–270°C, one mol of INH-DCB is
lost, which is confirmed by mass loss of 37.20%–41.96% at
this stage. Another mol of INH-DCB is lost in the
280–390°C temperature range. Finally at 
∼ 615°C, metal-oxide (Co3O4 
or NiO)
formation takes place [].

Biological properties
The antimicrobial screening data are presented in
. The table shows that the metal complexes
exhibit antimicrobial properties and it is important to note that
these complexes exhibit enhanced activity in contrast to the free
ligand. The increased lipophilic character of these complexes
seems to be responsible for their enhanced potent antibacterial
activity. It may be suggested that these complexes deactivate
various cellular enzymes, which play a vital role in various
metabolic pathways of these microorganisms. It has also been
proposed that the ultimate action of the toxicant is the
denaturation of one or more proteins of the cell, which as a
result, impairs normal cellular processes. The antifungal activity
of the cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes was evaluated against
F oxysporum and M phaseolina 
by the agar plate techniques by mixing
solutions of the metal complexes in different concentrations in
DMF which were then mixed with the medium. The linear
growth of the fungus was recorded by measuring the diameter of
colony after 96 hours and the percentage inhibition was
calculated as 100 (C-T)/C, where  C and T are the diameters of
the fungus colony in the control and test plates, respectively
().

CONCLUSION
The present study revealed octahedral geometry around
Co(II) and Ni(II) 
complexes, in which the ligand
INH-DCB acts as a neutral bidentate coordinating through nitrogen
and oxygen atoms and thus forming stable five-membered
chelates. Tentative structures of the present chelates can be
shown in Figures  and 
. The
results of antimicrobial activity show that the metal complexes
exhibit antimicrobial properties and it is important to note that
they show enhanced inhibitory activity compared to the parent
ligand. It has also been proposed that concentration plays a vital
role in increasing the degree of inhibition; as the concentration
increases, the activity increases.
