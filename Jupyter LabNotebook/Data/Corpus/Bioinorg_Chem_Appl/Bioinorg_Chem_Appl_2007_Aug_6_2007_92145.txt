1. INTRODUCTION
The aim of this investigation was to study anti-inflammatory as well as lipoxygenase inhibitory activities and cytotoxicity of a series of
organosilicon-containing thiazole derivatives.


It is well known that thiazolyl derivatives possess
anti-inflammatory activity  [–]. Today requirements
demand novel medicinal remedies possessing different degrees of
selectivity and specificity depending on their purpose. Process of
inflammation often becomes chronic, and the human organism needs
drugs therapy support in periods of acute attacks. Therefore,
increase of the variety of specific and selective
anti-inflammatory remedies is an important task, especially due to
its positive influence on the chronic sick rate decrease. Some
anticancer drugs as blenoxane, bleomycine, and tiazofurin,
containing thiazolyl moiety in their structure, are known as
antineoplastics  []. Besides, several thiazolyl derivatives
were found to be potent antitumour agents  [–]. Since
arachidic acid (AA) metabolism results in the generation of
mutagens that damage DNA and induce mutations, members of
arachidic acid enzymes, especially the lipoxygenase pathway, have
been reported to play a significant role in carcinogenesis.
Inhibitors of AA metabolism can reverse the production of these
metabolites resulting in recruitment of apoptotic cells clearance
 [].


Organosilicon compounds attract scientific attention due to some
different reasons, especially due to a number of interesting
results in the field of their biological action. Modern
organosilicon chemistry coincided with the emergence of
biomaterials and bioengineering fields fifty years ago. It has
been reported that some organosilicon compounds affect the
collagen biosynthesis in cartilagenous tissue  []. New
approaches based on the organosilicon modification of the
biologically active compounds, especially of compounds containing
hydrophilic functional groups, offer the real possibility to
improve their pharmacological properties because of easier
penetration of modified compounds through lipophilic barriers
inside the body  [, ]. In this paper, we report the
biological activity of trimethylsilyl ethers of thiazole
derivatives, but the wide possibility for variation of
substituents around the silicon atom can lead to more fine
selection of perspective compound for the investigations
in vivo.


2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Chemistry
1H NMR spectra were recorded with a Mercury 200 (Varian) spectrometer using CDCl3 as solvent and
hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO) as internal standard (for
unsilylated compounds). Mass spectra under electron impact
conditions were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard apparatus (HP-6890,
GC with HP5MS, 70 eV). Analytical thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on Macherey-Nagel silica plastic plates, with
visualization under UV (254 mm). Column chromatography was
performed using Merck silica gel (0.040–0.063 mm). Solvents
and reagents were purchased from the following commercial sources:
Fluka, Aldrich, Acros. Melting points were determined on a Boetius
melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. Elemental analyses
were performed on Carlo Erba 1108 elemental analyzer. Elemental
analyses (C, H, N, S) for all compounds synthesized were within

2.2. Biological assays
2.2.1. Carrageenin-induced mice paw edema inhibition []
AKR or A mice (20–30 g, groups of ten) of both sexes were
used. Females pregnant were excluded. A single dose of
0.2 mmol/kg body weight of compounds 12, 16,
20, 21 and 0.01 mmol/kg of compound
22 or 0.013 mmol/kg of compound 14 suspended
in water with few drops of Tween 80 was administered
intraperitoneally simultaneously to the
intradermally injection of 0.05 mL carrageenin in the
right hind paw. Indomethacin was used as a standard diluted agent.
Inhibition caused by indomethacin was 57.4% in dose
0.1 mmol/kgbw.


2.2.2. Soybean lipoxygenase inhibition []
The tested compounds dissolved in DMSO or ethanol (concentrations
ranged from 0.1 to 1 mM) were incubated at room temperature
with sodium linoleate (0.1 mmol) and 0.2 mL of enzyme
solution (250 U/mL in saline). The conversion of sodium
linoleate to 13-hydroperoxylinoleic acid at 234 nm was
recorded and compared with nordihydroguaretic acid (0.1 mmol -
84%), an appropriate standard inhibitor.

2.2.3. Cytotoxicity
Monolayer tumour cell lines MG-22A (mouse hepatoma), HT-1080
(human fibrosarcoma), and normal mouse fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) were
cultivated for 72 hours in DMEM standard medium (Sigma)
without an indicator and antibiotics. After the ampoule had
thawed, cells from one to four passages were used in three
concentrations of test compound: 1, 10 and 100 μg
mL−1. The control cells and cells with tested compounds in
the range of 2–5* 104 cell mL−1 concentration (depending on line nature) were placed on separate 96 wells
plates. Solutions containing test compounds were diluted and added
in wells to give the final concentrations. Control cells were
treated in the same manner only in the absence of test compounds.
Plates were cultivated for 72 hours. The number of survived
cells was determined using crystal violet (CV),
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolinium bromide
(MTT), or neutral red (NR) coloration which was assayed by
multiscan spectrophotometer. The quantity of alive cells on
control plate was taken in calculations for 100%  [, ].
The LC50 was calculated using Graph Pad Prism 3.0 program, r &lt; .05. Concentration of NO was determined according to
 [].

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Thiazole derivatives of general formula presented in
 have been studied.

N-(2-thiazolyl)amides, containing 4-hydroxypiperidine residue,
were synthesized by consecutive condensation reactions:
2-aminothiazole reacted with appropriate acyl chloride
(chloroacetic or chloropropionic acid chlorides) to give the
respective chloroalkylamides (1–5)  [, ], then
the reaction of the prepared chloroalkylamides with N-containing
heterocycle, 4-hydroxypiperidine, gave the corresponding thiazolyl
amides (6–10)  []. The organosilicon derivatives
have been prepared in two ways: (a) by introducing of O-silyl
group into hydroxyl-containing thiazole compounds, to obtain the
compounds 12, 14, 16,
17–21, and (b) by introducing C-silyl group
using quarternization reaction of nitrogen to obtain the compound
22  []. The general synthetic methods employed are
shown in .

Structures of the compounds prepared were confirmed by 1H-NMR, GC-MS spectroscopy, and by elemental analysis. Theoretical
calculations of lipophilicity as clog P for compounds
synthesized, using the method of additivity, were performed
 [] (). We investigated anti-inflammatory
and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities and cytotoxicity of
organosilicon-containing thiazole derivatives.

Organosilicon-containing compounds 12, 14,
16, 20–22 were examined in vivo for
their anti-inflammatory activity using the carrageenin mice paw
edema (CPE) as a model of inflammation. The in vivo
anti-inflammatory effects of the tested thiazole derivatives were
assessed by using the functional model of carrageenin-induced rat
paw edema and are presented in  as percentage
of weight increase at the right hind paw in comparison to the
uninjected left hind paw.

Carrageenin-induced edema is a nonspecific inflammation resulting
from a complex of diverse mediators  []. Since edemas of
this type are highly sensitive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), carrageenin has been accepted as a useful agent
for studying new anti-inflammatory drugs  []. This model
reliably predicts anti-inflammatory efficacy of the NSAIDs, and
during the second phase it detects compounds which are
anti-inflammatory agents as a result of inhibition of
prostaglandin amplification.

The studied compounds 12, 14, 16,
20–22 were found to protect in
vivo against edema formation. Analyzing the data obtained, it is
revealed that 21 and 22 were more potent among
all the compounds tested. Compound 21 exhibited similar
to indomethacin inhibition—57.2%, but in double dose
(0.2 mmol/kgbw). Organosilicon salt 22 was found to
be the most potent inhibitor, possessing about the same as
indomethacin inhibition (55.0%), but in lower dose
(0.01 mmol/kgbw). 4,5-disubstitued thiazole without
2-substituent (12) was found to be the least active
compound.

The compounds 12, 14, 16–20, and 22 were evaluated for inhibition of soybean
lipoxygenase (LOX) by the UV-absorbance-based enzyme assay
 []. While one may not extrapolate the quantitative results
of this assay to the inhibition of mammalian 5-LOX, it has been
shown that inhibition of plant lipoxygenase activity by NSAIDs is
qualitatively similar to their inhibition of the rat mast cell
lipoxygenase and may be used as a simple qualitative screen for
such activity. The results are presented in .
All the tested compounds were found to inhibit soybean
lipoxygenase. The IC50 values for compounds
14, 16, 17, 19, and 22
were determined. They ranged within 0.01–0.47 mmol. For other
compounds (12, 18, and 20) persentage of
inhibition at concentration 0.1 mmol was determined.

It has been revealed that among trimethylsiloxyalkyl/trimethylsilylalkyl thiazole derivatives
(12, 14, 16, and 22), compound
14, containing 2-amino group, was the most active as
lipoxygenase inhibitor (IC50 = 0.1 mmol),
but 12 without substituent at C2-position of
thiazole cycle was found to be the least active compound in this
respect. It inhibits lipoxygenaze action only by 9.1% in dose of
0.1 mmol.

It was found that among organosilicon-containing
2-thiazolyl-amides 17–20, the presence of
substituent in C4-position of thiazole ring is essential
for lipoxygenase inhibition display. Compounds 19 and
18 were the most potent lipoxygenase inhibitors
(IC50 = 0.01 mmol, and 66.7% inhibition in dose of 0.1 mmol, correspondingly). Compound 19 was the most
active lipoxygenaze inhibitor also among all compounds tested. It
was also revealed that the nature of C4-substituent
influences the degree of inhibition: 4-methoxyphenyl
derivative (19) was a better inhibitor in comparison with
its 4-phenyl analog (18). Introduction of additional
bulky substituent in C5-position of the molecule was
telling on the level of inhibition. Thus, compound 20
possessed lower inhibiting properties (by 26%) in comparison with
C5-unsubstituted compound 18. Compound
17 without substituent at C4-position of
thiazole ring was the least potent inhibitor (IC50 =
0.35 mmol). Concerning the correlation of
lipophilicity—CPE and lipoxygenase inhibition—it was revealed
that these parameters do not proceed in parallel along the
compounds investigated.

The experimental evaluation of cytotoxicity of compounds
6, 8, 17, and 19 is presented
in .

Compound 8 and its trimethylsilyl ether 19
possess low cytotoxic effect on human fibrosarcoma HT-1080
(LC50 &gt; 100 μg/mL) and moderate effect on
mouse hepatoma MG-22A (LC50 = 17 and 21 μg/mL,
correspondingly, CV, and LC50 = 16 and 13 μg/mL, correspondingly, MTT coloration). Compound 6 and
its trimethilsilyl ether 17 without substituents at
C4- and C5-positions of thiazole do not exhibit
cytotoxic properties. Both compounds decrease MG-22A cell growing
by up to 40% (MTT coloration), but at the same time, stimulated
HT-1080 cell growing at all studied concentrations by up to 55%
(CV). No significant difference among compounds was determined
comparing their NO-generation ability in HT-1080 cell lines.
Compound 19 possessed the highest NO-generation activity
concerning MG-22A tumour cells. All studied compounds were
nontoxic compounds concerning normal cells NIH 3T3.

Analyzing the results obtained for 2-thiazolyl amides 6,
8, 17, 19 and previously published data
on cytotoxicity of silylated compounds 18, 20,
21 and their nonsilylated precursors 7,
9, 10  [], it was revealed that all
4-trimethylsiloxypiperidine derivatives of 2-thiazolyl amides
17–21 possessed low or moderate cytotoxic
effect concerning either human fibrosarcoma (LC50
= 44–77 μg/mL) or mouse hepatoma (LC50 =
13–59 μg/mL), excluding compound 17, which was
inactive in both tests. The strongest cytotoxic effect on mouse
hepatoma was observed for 18 (LC50 =
5.3 μg/mL, CV test). It can be noted that all
2-thiazolyl amides, which have bulky substituent in
C4-position of thiazole ring (compounds
7–9 and 18–20), exhibited
moderate effect on MG-22A cell line (LC50 =
5.3–37 μg/mL, CV). Among unsilylated compounds
7–9, the most lipophilic 9 (clog P = 9.134) with additional tetradecyl substituent in
C5-position possesses the highest cytotoxicity on
MG-22A cell line (LC50 = 8 μg/mL, CV).

The distance elongation between thiazolyl and piperidyl
heterocycles, either in unsilylated compounds 6,
10 or silylated ones 17, 21, leads to
cytotoxic effect appearance for propionamides 10 and
21, concerning human fibrosarcoma (LC50 = 48 μg/mL and 44 μg/mL, correspondingly) or its essential increase, concerning mouse hepatoma (LC50 = 35 μg/mL for 10 and 44 μg/mL for 21, CV), in comparison with the corresponding acetamides 6 and 17.

The introduction of trimethylsilyl group into compound 7
caused the cytotoxic effect increase concerning mouse hepatoma,
which was revealed as the highest for 18 (LC50= 5.3 μg/mL), among all the compounds studied.

4. CONCLUSIONS
The organosilicon thiazoles studied were found to a certain extent
to protect in vivo against edema formation and to inhibit
soybean lipoxygenase. Organosilicon salt 22 was the most
potent as anti-inflammatory agent among all compounds tested and
indomethacin.

The nature of substituent in C4-position of thiazole
ring is essentially telling on the degree of lipoxygenase
inhibition and cytotoxic activity. The most active as lipoxygenase
inhibitor was
2-(4-trimethylsilyloxypiperidin-1-yl)-N-[4-(p-methoxyphenyl)-thiazol-2-yl]-acetamide
(19), which contains bulky p-MeO-C6H4-group at C4-position.

The distance elongation between thiazolyl and piperidyl
heterocycles either in parent compounds (6, 10)
or their silyl ethers (17, 21) leads to
cytotoxic effect noticeable increase for propionamides 10
and 21 in comparison with the corresponding acetamides
6 and 17. Trimethylsilyl ether 18 was
the most active against mouse hepatoma among all the compounds
studied and in comparison with its unsilylated precursor
7.

It can be noted that the data obtained do not allow to  conclude
definitely the existence of relationship among
anti-inflammatory activity, lipoxygenase inhibition, and
cytotoxicity. But in some cases, cytotoxic properties were
accompanied by anti-inflammatory activity (organosilicon salt
22) or lipoxygenase inhibition activity display
(thiazolyl acetamides 18 and 19). At the same
time, compound 4-methyl-5-(β-trimethylsiloxyethyl)-thiazole
(12) was the least active concerning all the biological
properties studied.

The wide possibility for variation of substituents around the
silicon atom can promote finer selection of perspective compound
for further investigations.
