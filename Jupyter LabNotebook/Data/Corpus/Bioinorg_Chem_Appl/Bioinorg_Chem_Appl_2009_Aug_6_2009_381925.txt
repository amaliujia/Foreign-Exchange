1. Introduction
Indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling constants (J) provide highly important information around coupled nuclei, containing strongly bonded and weakly interacting states, since the values depend on the electron distribution between the nuclei [–]. One–bond (1J), two-bond (geminal) (2J), three-bond (vicinal) (3J), and even longer coupling constants (nJ  (n ≥ 4)) are observed between selenium atoms, which will give important information around the coupled nuclei. The mechanism for 1J must be of the through-bond type; however, that for nJ  (n ≥ 2) would contain through-space interactions, especially for nJ  (n ≥ 4). Quantum chemical (QC) calculations are necessary for the analysis and the interpretation of the J values with physical meanings. Important properties of molecules will be clarified by elucidating the mechanism of spin-spin couplings on the basis of the molecular orbital (MO) theory.

Various 1Jobsd (Se, Se) values are reported for alkyl and/or aryl derivatives of dimethyl diselenide (1a) (RSeSeR′: 1). They are usually small (1Jobsd (Se, Se:  1)  ≤  64 Hz; see ). We examined 1J(Se, Se) of naphto[1,8-c,d]-1,2-diselenole (4-Y-1,8-Se2C10H5 (2): Y = H (a) [–], OMe (b), Me (c), Cl (d), COOMe (e), CN (f), and NO2 (g)), which correspond to the symperiplanar diselenides (). The 1J(Se, Se) values are measured for 2c, 2d, and 2g, and large 1Jobsd (Se, Se) values of 330–380 Hz are detected. summarizes the 1Jobsd (Se, Se) values.

Why are 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 2) much larger than 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 1)? How do 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 2) depend on the substituent Y in 2? 1J(Se, Se) are analyzed on the basis of the MO theory, as the first step to investigate the nature of the bonded and nonbonded interactions between selenium atoms through nJ(Se, Se) []. 1J(Se, Se) are calculated for 1a and 2a–g.

According to the nonrelativistic theory, there are several mechanisms contributing to the spin-spin coupling constants. As expressed in (), the total value (nJTL) is composed of the contributions from the diamagnetic spin-orbit (DSO) term (nJDSO), the paramagnetic spin-orbit (PSO) term (nJPSO), the spin-dipolar (SD) term (nJSD), and the Fermi contact (FC) term (nJFC), 


				
			


				 summarizes the mechanism of the indirect nuclear spin-spin couplings. The origin of the terms, nJDSO, nJPSO, nJSD, and nJFC, is also illustrated, contributing to nJTL. The ground state of a molecule (M) is the singlet state (S0) if the nuclei (N) in M have no magnetic moments. However, the ground state cannot be the pure S0 if N possesses magnetic moments, μN. The ground state perturbed by μN is expressed as follows: DSO arise by the reorganization of S0; therefore, they are usually very small. PSO appears by the mixing of upper singlet states (S1, S2, S3,…). FC and SD originate if admixtures occur from upper triplet states (T1, T2, T3,…), where only s-type atomic orbitals contribute to FC.

Calculated 1JTL values are evaluated separately by the four components as shown in (). The 1J(Se, Se) values are evaluated using the Slater-type atomic orbitals, which are equipped in the ADF 2008 program [–]. Evaluations of the values are performed employing the ADF program, after structural optimizations with the Gaussian 03 program []. Contributions from each ψi and each ψi → ψa transition are evaluated separately, where ψi and ψa denote occupied and unoccupied MOs, respectively. The treatment enables us to recognize and visualize clearly the origin of the indirect nuclear spin-spin couplings.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and Measurements
Manipulations were performed under an argon atmosphere with standard vacuum-line techniques. Glassware was dried at 130°C  overnight. Solvents and reagents were purified by standard procedures as necessary. Melting points were measured with a Yanaco-MP apparatus of uncorrected.

Anal. Calc. for C10H5Se2Cl: C, 37.71; H, 1.58%; found: C, 37.83; H, 1.60%.

2.4. Preparation of 4-nitronaphtho[1,8-c,d]-1,2-diselenole (2d)
According to a method similar to that previously reported for 2a [–] from 1,8-dibromo-4-nitronaphthalene, 2d was obtained as dark purple needles in 28% yield, m.p. 196.0–197.0°C. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz, TMS): δ 7.40 (d, 1H, J = 8.3 Hz), 7.52 (dd, 1H, J = 4.1 and 7.6 Hz), 7.53 (s, 1H), 8.18 (d, 1H, J = 8.3 Hz), 8.51 (dd, 1H, J = 2.7 and 4.1 Hz); 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 300 MHz, TMS): δ 7.57 (dd, 1H, J = 7.5 and 8.5 Hz), 7.77 (d, 1H, J = 8.5 Hz), 7.84 (dd, 1H, J = 0.7 and 7.5 Hz), 8.20 (d, 1H, J = 8.5 Hz), 8.29 (dd, 1H, J = 0.7 and 8.5 Hz); 13C NMR (DMSO-d6, 75.5 MHz, TMS): δ 118.2, 120.0, 123.4, 127.1, 129.4, 131.1, 139.0, 140.8, 144.2, 155.5; 77Se NMR (CDCl3, 76.2 MHz, Me2Se): δ 448.8, 474.4.

2.5. Measurements of 1J(Se, Se)
During the measurement of 77Se NMR spectra for 2g (Y = NO2) in chloroform-d solutions (0.050 M) at 297 K, a typical AB quartet pattern of the spectra was observed. After careful analysis of the spectrum for 2g, 1J(Se, Se) of 330.8 Hz was obtained. The 1J(Se, Se) values are obtained similarly by the careful analysis of the spectra for 2c and 2d.

2.6. Calculation Method
Structures of 1a are optimized employing the 6-311++G(3df,2pd) basis sets of the Gaussian 03 program [–] at the DFT (B3LYP) level [–]. The torsional angle CMeSeSeCMe (ϕ) is 88.38° in the full-optimized structure of 1a. Calculations that are further performed on 1a: 1a are fully optimized except for ϕ, which are fixed by every 15° or 30°. Optimizations are also performed on 2a–g using the 6-311+G(3df) basis sets [–] for Se and the 6-311+G(3d,2p) basis sets for other nuclei at the DFT (B3LYP) level [–]. The C2v symmetry is assumed for 2a, Cs for 2b–d and 2f, and the C1 symmetry for 2e and 2g. 

The J(Se, Se) values are calculated with the triple ξ basis sets of the Slater type with two sets of polarization functions (2 × 1s, 2 × 2s, 2 × 2p, 2 × 3s, 2 × 3p, 3 × 3d, 3 × 4s, 3 × 4p, 1 × 4d, and 1 × 4f for Se) at the DFT (BLYP) level of the ADF 2008 program [–], applying on the optimized structures with the Gaussian 03 program []. Calculations are performed at the nonrelativistic level. The scalar ZORA relativistic formulation [–] is also applied to 2a, for convenience of comparison. The nJTL values are evaluated separately by nJDSO, nJPSO, nJSD, and nJFC, as shown in (). Mechanisms of the nuclear couplings are revealed by decomposing the contributions to each ψi and each ψi → ψa transition [, ].

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Observed 1Jobsd (Se, Se)

					collects 1Jobsd (Se, Se), necessary for discussion. The magnitudes of the 1Jobsd (Se, Se) values are usually small (&lt; 64 Hz) for the simple derivatives of MeSeSeMe (1a) (RSeSeR′: 1) [, , ]. On the other hand, large 1Jobsd (Se, Se) are recorded for 2 (4-Y-1,8-Se2C10H5), which correspond to symperiplanar diselenides, although not detected in 2a (Y = H) [–]. The values are 379.4 Hz for 2b (Y = Me), 375.9 Hz for 2c (Y = Cl), and 330.8 Hz for 2d (Y = NO2). 1J(Se, Se: 2) becomes smaller as the electron accepting ability of Y increases.

3.2. Mechanism of 1J(Se, Se) in 1a

					shows the calculated 1JTL and the components, 1JDSO, 1JPSO, 1JSD, and 1JFC, in 1J(Se, Se: 1a). 1JTL (Se, Se: 1a) is predicted to be less than 44 Hz for ϕ = 90° ± 15°. Therefore, 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 1) is explained substantially and modeled by 1a with ϕ ≈ 90°, although R and R′ in 1 must also affect on the values. 1J(Se, Se: 1a) is predicted to be very large at ϕ = 0° (684 Hz) and 180° (628 Hz). Consequently, 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 2) of 331–379 Hz are essentially explained by 1J(Se, Se: 1a) with ϕ = 0°.draws the plots of 1JDSO, 1JPSO, 1JSD, 1JFC, 1JSD+FC, and 1JTL versus ϕ in 1a. It is well demonstrated that 1JTL changes depending on ϕ, similarly to the case of 3J(H, H), three-bond (vicinal) couplings in 1H NMR spectra [, ]. 1JDSO are negligible (&lt; 0.03 Hz).

How do 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 1a) [=1JSD (Se, Se: 1a) + 1JFC (Se, Se: 1a)] contribute to 1JTL (Se, Se: 1a)? 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 1a) are plotted versus 1JTL (Se, Se: 1a), although not shown. The correlations are given in () and (), respectively. The results exhibit that 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 1a) contribute 65% and 35% to 1JTL (Se, Se: 1a), respectively, irrespective of the ϕ(CSeSeC) values:


					
					
				

Why does 1J(Se, Se: 1a) show the torsional angular dependence? What orbitals and transitions contribute to the dependence? 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) is analyzed next.

3.2.1. Analysis of 1JPSO (Se, Se) in 1a
The mechanism of 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) is discussed by analyzing the contributions separately from each ψi and each ψi → ψa transition.lists the ϕ dependence of 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) contributed from ψ1–ψ43, ψ1–ψ38, ψ39–ψ43, ψ39, ψ40, ψ41, ψ42, and ψ43. The contribution from ψ39–ψ43 to 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) is large, whereas that from ψ1–ψ38 is small, although not shown. The plot of the contributions from ψ39–ψ43 (y) versus those from ψ1–ψ43 (x) provides an excellent correlation (y = 0.976x + 37.3 : r2 = 0.9999).shows those from ψ39, ψ40, ψ41, ψ42, and ψ43 and exhibits those from ψ39–ψ41, ψ42–ψ43, and ψ39–ψ43. Contributions from ψ42 and ψ43 exchange with each other at ϕ ≈ 90°. Those of ψ39 and ψ40 do at ϕ ≈ 135° (). The contributions from ψ42-ψ43 and ψ39–ψ41 almost cancel out at ϕ ≈ 90° ().

Magnitudes of the contributions from ψ42 and ψ43 to 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) are very large at 0° and 180° (), although those from ψ42 and ψ43 are negative and positive directions, respectively. The values amount to −353 to −360 Hz and 753–793 Hz, respectively. The contributions from ψ42–ψ43 are 433, 218, and 400 Hz at 0°, 90°, and 180°, respectively, and those from ψ39–ψ41 are 17, −198, and 10 Hz at 0°, 90°, and 180°, respectively. Therefore, the mechanism of 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) will be clarified by analyzing the contributions from ψ42 and ψ43 at 0° and 180°. The mechanism would be complex at 90°, since the small magnitude is the results of the total contributions from ψ39–ψ43.


						shows the ψ42 → ψ44 and ψ43 → ψ44 transitions at both ϕ = 0° and 180° which are shown in . Characters of ψ42(HOMO-1), ψ43(HOMO), and ψ44(LUMO) are π(Se–Se), π*(Se–Se), and σ*(Se–Se), respectively, at ϕ = 0° and 180°. ψ42(HOMO-1) is essentially the same as ψ43(HOMO) at ϕ = 90°. ψ42 and ψ43 at ϕ = 90° are also drawn in , to show how ψ42 and ψ43 interconvert with each other. Contrary to the case of ϕ ≈ 0 and 180°, all of ψ39–ψ43 contribute to 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) at ϕ ≈ 90°. Contributions from the ψ42 → ψ44 and ψ43 → ψ44 transitions to 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) at 90° are almost cancelled by those from the ψ39 → ψ44, ψ40 → ψ44, and ψ41 → ψ44 transitions. In addition, both 1JSD (Se, Se: 1a) and 1JFC (Se, Se: 1a) substantially contribute at ϕ ≈ 90°. Consequently, it is difficult to specify a few orbitals, together with the transitions, which control 1J(Se, Se: 1a) at ϕ ≈ 90°. The character of ψ44 [LUMO: σ*(Se–Se)] does not change so much depending on ϕ. Therefore, the behavior of ψ39–ψ43 must be mainly responsible for the ϕ dependence in 1J(Se, Se: 1a) (see Figures  and ). The MO description in visualizes the origin of 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) and helps us to understand the mechanism, especially at ϕ = 0° and 180°.

After elucidation of the mechanism for 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a), next extension is to clarify 1J(Se, Se: 2) on the basis of the MO theory.

3.2.2. Evaluation of 1J(Se, Se) for 2

						collects the calculated 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) values, together with JPSO(Se, Se: 2), 1JSD (Se, Se: 2), 1JFC (Se, Se: 2), and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 2). also contains the nuclear changes calculated with the natural bond orbital analysis (NBO) method (Qn(Se)) [–] for 2 having Y of H (a), OMe (b), Me (c), Cl (d), COOMe (e), CN (f), and NO2 (g). The Y dependence of 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 2) is well reproduced by the calculations. 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) are predicted to be larger than the observed values by about 100 Hz. The DFT method overestimates the reciprocal energy differences (εa − εi)−1, which would partly be responsible for the larger evaluation. The 1J(Se, Se) values are calculated at both nonrelativistic and scalar ZORA relativistic levels for 2a. The former is smaller than the latter. The value calculated at the nonrelativistic level seems to be closer to the observed value than that obtained with the scalar ZORA relativistic formulation in our calculation system. Therefore, it would be reasonable to discuss the nJ(Se, Se) value calculated at the nonrelativistic level in this case.

Before discussion of 1J(Se, Se: 2), it would be instructive to clarify the behavior of Qn(Se: 2), which changes depending on Y.shows the plot of Qn(2Se: 2) versus Qn(1Se: 2). The correlations of the linear type (y = ax + b with r (correlation coefficient)) are given in the figure. The results show that Qn(2Se: 2) grows larger as the accepting ability of Y increases for Y = H, OMe, Me, Cl, and COOMe then it becomes almost constant for Y = CN and NO2 while Qn(1Se: 2) grows larger as the accepting ability of Y increases for all Y in . Qn(2Se: 2) seems saturated for Y of very strong acceptors such as CN and NO2 while Qn(1Se: 2) will not for all Y.

How do 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) being controlled? 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) are plotted versus Qn(1Se),   Qn(2Se), and Qn(1Se)+Qn(2Se).shows the plot of 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) versus Qn(1Se), which gives best correlation among the three. The correlation is given in the figure. 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) are confirmed to be controlled by Qn(1Se). One might imagine that 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) should be controlled by Qn(1Se)+Qn(2Se). The saturation in Qn(2Se) shown in would perturb to give good correlations for 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) versus Qn(1Se) + Qn(2Se). It is demonstrated that 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) becomes smaller when Qn(Se) increases, experimentally and theoretically.

After clarification of the Y dependence in 1JTL (Se, Se: 2), next extension is to elucidate the mechanism for 1J(Se, Se: 2) on the basis of the MO theory.

3.3. Mechanism of 1J(Se, Se) in 2a
How do 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2) and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 2) contribute to 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) in the change of Y? 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2) and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 2) are plotted versus 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) for various Y in . The results for 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2) and 1JSD+FC (Se, Se: 2) are given in () and (), respectively. The correlations are very good, which shows that 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2) contributes predominantly to 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) (70%), irrespective of Y:
								

The origin of 1J(Se, Se: 2) is elucidated by analyzing 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a) on the basis of the MO theory, since 1JPSO (Se, Se) contributes predominantly to 1JTL (Se, Se) irrespective of Y.depicts the contributions of 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a) separately from each ψi and each ψi → ψa transition. (a)–(c) in plot the contributions to 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a) from each ψi and each transition of the ψ67 → ψa and ψ66 → ψa types, respectively. In , contributions around ψ5–ψ10, ψ23–ψ28, and ψ53–ψ67 originate mainly from atomic 2p(Se), 3p(Se), and 4p(Se) orbitals, respectively. Those caused by 2p(Se) and 3p(Se) are almost cancelled by summarizing over the corresponding orbitals. Therefore, 4p(Se) substantially contribute to 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a). Especially, ψ67 (HOMO) and ψ66 (HOMO-1) control 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a). ψa of ψ68 determines 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a), among a lot of ψi → ψa transitions in ψi of ψ67 and ψ66, as shown in Figures and .


					shows the ψ67 → ψ68 and ψ66 → ψ68 transitions in 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a). The large 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2a) value arises from the mixing of ψ68 [LUMO: σ*(Se–Se)] into ψ67 [HOMO: π*(Se–Se)] and ψ66 [HOMO-1: π(Se–Se)] at the singlet state. The MO presentation in is essentially the same as the ψ42 → ψ44 and ψ43 → ψ44 transitions in 1JPSO (Se, Se: 1a) at ϕ = 0° in , although ψ67 (2a) and ψ66 (2a) contain the π(Nap) character. Large 1JPSO (Se, Se: 2) and small 1Jobsd (Se, Se: 1) are well understood by the ϕ dependence in the calculated 1J(Se, Se: 1a) values.

4. Conclusion
Nuclear spin-spin coupling constants (J) provide highly important information around coupled nuclei, containing strongly bonded and weakly interacting states. The 1J(Se, Se) values are analyzed as the first step to investigate the nature of the bonded and nonbonded interactions between the Se atoms through nJ(Se, Se). QC calculations are necessary for the analysis and the interpretation of the J values with physical meanings. Calculated nJTL are composed of the contributions from nJDSO, nJPSO, nJSD, and nJFC. The decomposition helps us to consider the mechanisms of the spin-spin couplings, which are closely related to the electronic structures of compounds. Main contributions are evaluated separately from each ψi and each ψi → ψa transition, where ψi and ψa are occupied and unoccupied MO's, respectively.


				1J(Se, Se) is calculated modeled by MeSeSeMe (1a), which shows the typical torsional angular dependence of ϕ(CMeSeSeCMe). The dependence explains well 1Jobsd (Se, Se) of small values for RSeSeR′ (1) and large values for 4-Y-1,8-Se2C10H5 (2) which correspond to symperiplanar diselenides. 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) are confirmed to be controlled by Qn(Se). 1JTL (Se, Se: 2) are demonstrated to be smaller when Qn(Se) becomes larger, experimentally and theoretically. The PSO terms contribute predominantly to 1J(Se, Se). The contributions are analyzed separately from each ψi and each ψi → ψa transition. The MO description of each transition enables us to recognize and visualize clearly the origin and the mechanisms of the indirect nuclear spin-spin couplings. Important properties of molecules, such as electronic structures, will be clarified by elucidating the mechanisms of the spin-spin couplings on the basis of the MO theory.
