ABSTRACT
Glutathione, ),-Glu-Cys-Gly, is one of the most abundant small molecules in biosphere. Its main form is
the reduced monomer (GSH), serving to detoxicate xenobiotics and heavy metals, reduce protein thiols,
maintain cellular membranes and deactivate free radicals. Its oxidized dimer (GSSG) controls metal content
of metallothionein. The results presented provided a quantitative and structural description of Zn(II)-
glutathione complexes, including a novel ternary Zn(II)-GSH-His complex. A solution structure for this
complex was obtained using 2D-NMR. The Complexes studied may contribute to both zinc and glutathione
physiology. In the case of Ni(ll) complexes an interesting dependence of coordination modes on the ratios of
reactants was found. At high GSH excess a Ni(GSH)2 complex is formed, with Ni(ll) bonded through S and
N and/or O donor atoms. This complex may exist as a high- or low-spin species. Another goal of the studies
presented was to describe the catalytic properties ofNi(II) ions towards GSH oxidation, which appeared to be
an important step in nickel carcinogenesis. The pH dependence of oxidation rates allowed to determine the
Ni(GSH)2 complex as the most active among the toxicologically relevant species. Protonation and oxidation
of metal-free GSH and its analogues were also studied in detail. The monoprotonated form HL2
of GSH is
the one most susceptible to oxidation, due to a salt bridge between S- and NH3 groups, which activates the
thiol.
INTRODUCTION
Reduced glutathione (GSH) is a non-protein tripeptide of the sequence ),-Glu-Cys-Gly. It is present in
biological fluids and serves a variety of fundamental physiological functions. The intracellular concentration
of GSH in human cells is often as high as 20 mM. This makes it one of the most important organic

substances present in the human body /l, 2/. The most important functions of glutathione include
detoxication of xenobiotics and heavy metals, reduction of oxidation-prone protein thiols, maintenance of
cellular membranes and deactivation of free radicals/3/. Its disulfide, GSSG, restores disulfide bridges and
co-regulates metal content of metallothionein/4, 5/.
Due to its intracellular abundance, GSH is a likely target for metal ions, especially those having high
affinity for the thiolate sulfur/6, 7/. These metal ions include both biogenic elements, such as zinc, and
xenobiotic toxins, such as nickel, whose intracellular transport remains to be elucidated.
Zinc is involved, among others, in DNA transcription (enzymes, zinc fingers) and intracellular signaling
/8, 9/. It is known that GSSG releaseS Zn(ll) from its storage protein, metallothionein/10, 11/. The transport
of Zn(lI) ions across the cellular membrane is mediated by dedicated protein shuttles /12, 13/. The
mechanisms of Zn(II) delivery to its target proteins from these endpoints remain, however, unclear. One goal
of our studies was therefore to provide chemical data that might help assessing the possible involvement of
GSH/GSSG or other intracellular potential low molecular weight ligands in the cellular transport of Zn(II)
ions.
Nickel compounds are human carcinogens. While it is agreed that intracellular Ni(ll) is responsible for
neoplastic transformation, several divergent concepts in nickel carcinogenesis have been developed, as
reviewed recently /14/. Both direct genotoxic mechanisms, e.g. oxidative, and indirect ones, based on
inhibition/destruction of proteins involved in the maintenance of genetic material, such as DNA repair
systems, have gained support.
However, regardless of the actual mechanisms of nickel carcinogenesis, knowledge of the cellular
speciation of Ni(II) is needed for the selection of feasible mechanisms. Also, previous studies indicated that
the intracellular level of reduced glutathione (GSH) is an important factor in the process of cellular resistance
to Ni(II), which, in turn, depletes cellular GSH stores/15-17/. Therefore, our second goal was to elucidate the
equilibria and reactivities involving Ni(ll) and GSH.
ACID-BASE.AND COORDINATION ASPECTS OF GSH AND GSSG
The molecule of GSH (Scheme A) possesses eight potential donors of electronic density toward metal
ions. They can be grouped into three classes: the glutamic (amino acid-like) set of amine and carboxylate
donors, the thiol, and the peptide bonds. The isolated carboxylate of glycine can be functionally included into
the first class, but it often participates in metal coordination together with the thiol donor, due to the spatial
constraints. GSSG (Scheme B), in place of the reactive and coordinationally attractive thiol group, contains
a disulfide bridge, which interacts with metal ions very weakly /18/. Among these potential donors, the
carboxyls, the amine and the thioi are protonated/deprotonated spontaneously in aqueous solution: GSH has a
total of four such groups, and GSSG has a total of six, as shown on Scheme 1. At physiological conditions
both GSH and GSSG exist as H2L- ions, with deprotonated carboxylate groups and still protonated basic
functions. The logarithmic values ofprotonation constants of GSH and GSSG are presented in Table I.

BINARY COMPLEXES OF ZINC(II) IONS WITH GLUTATHIONE
The Zn(ll) ion, a borderline Lewis acid, is suited for interactions with such a versatile ligand as GSH. The
simultaneous presence of aminoacid-like and thiolate functions in its molecule results in the variety of Zn(II)
coordination modes, depending on pH and molar ratios. Studies of coordination equilibria performed by us
and our predecessors, in particular those applying NMR techniques, demonstrated the involvement of the
thiol function in Zn(II) coordination in the entire pH range of the binding/19-22/. The sulfur is accompanied
by residues of Glu or Gly donors. At highly alkaline pH, the y-Glu-Cys peptide nitrogen is deprotonated and
coordinated to Zn(II) (Scheme 2). This manifests itself in negative indices at H atoms in respective
stoichiometric formulae. Figure presents an example of a species distribution for the Zn(II)/GSH system.
The stability constants ofcomplexes are presented in Table 2.
The absence of the thiol function in GSSG reduces the variety of complex forms markedly. The Glu
residue is the main binding site for Zn(II), however, the ability of GSSG to form a 18-membered
macrochelate ring and coordinate the.Zn(II) ion with its both Glu residues results in a stability constant for its
ML species almost as high as the one With GSH (Table 2).

TERNARY ZINC(II) COMPLEXES
The sterical constraints, due to the simultaneous coordination of the thiol and the glutamic acid donors,
exclude the Giy carboxylate from the coordination to the same Zn(ll) ion. As a result, the coordination sphere
of the tetrahedral or five-coordinate Zn(ll) (as common for thiol-containing complexes/23, 24/) cannot be
saturated by one molecule of GSH. This feature makes the Zn(II)/GSH system prone for the formation of
ternary complexes. The separation of the thiol from the Glu donors also facilitates the formation of
monodentate, sulfur-only coordination mode. An example is provided in Scheme 3, where the structure ofthe
ternary complex, containing GSH and L-His is presented, as obtained from 2D NMR studies /25/. This
structure demonstrates the importance of various types of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in the shaping of
such ternary species.

COMPLEXES OF Ni(ll) IONS WITH GLUTATHIONE
Nickel(ll) exhibits little preference among sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen as potential donor atoms, similarly
to zinc(II). This results in similarities in coordination modes for GSH between these two metal ions, limited
however by differences in complex geometries, which are usually square-planar for thiolate-containing Ni(ll)
complexes and octahedral for the Ni(li) complexes without thiolate coordination /26/ (Figure 2). This
difference results in the formation of oligomeric complexes at low GSH-to-Ni(II) ratios. In the conditions of
GSH excess, which by the way are relevant physiologically, simpler monomeric or dimeric complexes are
formed, stoichiometrically and structurally similar to those of Zn(II). They are presented in Scheme 4. Table
2 presents their stability constants, which are in a fair agreement with those determined previously/27, 28/.
As seen in Scheme 4, all GSH complexes, except for NiHL, involve the thiolate coordination to Ni(ll). In
none of the cases the Gly carboxylate was identified as participating in Ni(II) binding. At high pH the y-Glu-
Cys peptide nitrogen is deprotonated and coordinated, in the NiH.L25 complex. Magnetic susceptibility
measurements indicated that all complex species, except for the latter alkaline species, retain a substantial
paramagnetism, which suggests the presence of an equilibrium between the high-spin and low-spin
complexes/29, 30/.

AIR OXIDATION OF GSH AND EFFECT OF Ni(ll).
Figure 3 provides the pH profile of the rate constant for air oxidation of uncomplexed GSH to GSSG,
demonstrating a perfect match between the rate of this process and the occurrence of the HL3
protonation
form of GSH/30/. Our unpublished results indicate that this correlation is caused by the presence of a salt
bridge between the protonated NH3+
and the deprotonated S in GSH. The distance between these groups, ca.
2.85 A, is such that GSH can easily accommodate, by dipolar interactions, and activate dioxygen, and other
diatomic molecules. Therefore, the air oxidation of GSH is basically an autocatalytic process, which does not
depend on the presence of catalytic amounts oftransition metals/3 l/.
Quite surprisingly, we found out that an acceleration of this process by Ni(II) ions in a phosphate/Tris
buffer is weak and limited to the alkaline pH range, up to 4-fold at pH 9; no effect was seen at pH 7.4, in the
presence of only minor octahedral Ni(II) complexes. The pH profile, presented in Figure 3, demonstrates that
the (predominantly) square-planar NiHL2
-and NiL24- complexes were the most effective ones in facilitating
air oxidation of GSH. On the other hand, the strictly square-planar NiH_IL25 complex did not oxidize GSH
/30/.
CONSEQUENCES FOR PHYSIOLOGY
The stability constants, obtained for Zn(II) and Ni(II) complexes of GSH, allowed for quantitative
estimations of their biological relevance, lntraceilular Zn(II) is tightly controlled, at least in part, by proteins,
and the estimates, available for E. Coli, suggest that the global distribution of Zn(II) is under kinetic rather
than thermodynamic control/12/. The situation may be different in eukaryotic cells, where "flee" or loosely
bound Zn(II) ions have been reported/32, 33/. Nevertheless, a very high variety of zinc proteins, such as
hydrolytic enzymes or zinc fingers, and the lack of essential data on them, such as binding constants and
number of copies, makes it impossible to even roughly estimate the intracellular Zn(ll) speciation. An
alternative approach, which can provide a view on the possible involvement of GSH in Zn(II) speciation, is
to calculate partitions between GSH (L) at a given physiological concentration and pH on one hand and a
range of hypothetical competing ligands (Z), with various binding constants, on another. Such calculations
provide a competitivity index of ligand L (or the pair of ligands L, A in the case of temary complexes)
towards a metal ion M, defined as the logarithm of the conditional stability constant of MZ, the metal
complex of Z, such that Yi.k(/MjH/LkA/ /MZ/. The value of this index depends on the assumed total
concentrations of the metal ion and the competitor Z. The index for GSH, calculated for Zn(II) and Z at 0.2
mM (based on ref./12/) and pH 7.4 is 8.05 at 10 mM and 6.1 at mM/25/. This means that the range of zinc
proteins that may be controlled by GSH includes those with Zn(II) binding constants between 106
and 108.
This tentative result indicates that the local concentration of GSH may regulate the activity of some, but not
all zinc enzymes and structural proteins/33/. On the other hand, the effect of histidine on the intracellular fate
of Zn(II) may be very limited, due to the relatively low binding constant and limited concentration in vivo
/25/. These results are very preliminary by their very nature and should be treated merely as a guide for
designing relevant experiments. One interesting venue may be to study the formation of potential ternary

Zn(II) complexes with GSH and other chelators, abundant intracellularly, such as nucleotides (e.g. ATP).
In contrast with Zn(II), Ni(II) is not physiological in humans and has no dedicated metabolic pathways or
transport and storage proteins. Therefore, the attempts to estimate its general speciation and deduce the role
of GSH from such calculations are justified/30, 34/. Our recent results indicate that GSH may play only a
minor role in Ni(II) speciafion, in favor of histidine, ATP and histone proteins. This fact, together with the
lack of oxidative activity of Ni(II) towards GSH at pH 7.4, casts doubts on the direct relevance of GSH for
Ni(II) toxicity. The indirect effects may, however, be more interesting. We have recently presented the study
of Ni(II) assault on the zinc finger of XPA, a crucial protein of the nucleotide excision pathway of DNA
repair/35/. The results on GSH complexes of Zn(ll) and Ni(II), presented in this review, allow to analyze the
effect of increasing GSH concentrations on the equilibrium between Zn(II) and Ni(II) forms of the XPA zinc
finger peptide. The results are presented in Figure 4, which clearly demonstrates the synergy between GSH
and Ni(ll) in depleting the zinc finger peptide of Zn(ll). This effect is due to the fact that the stability
constants of GSH complexes of Zn(II) are higher from those of Ni(II) (e.g. those for MHL2 and ML2 by 2
orders of magnitude, Table 2), and therefore the increasing GSH concentrations provide a suitable sink for
Zn(ll).
Overall, our recent results on GSH complexes with Zn(ll) and Ni(ll) have provided a good basis for
predicting interesting physiological effects and may be useful for design and interpretation of suitable
biological experiments.
