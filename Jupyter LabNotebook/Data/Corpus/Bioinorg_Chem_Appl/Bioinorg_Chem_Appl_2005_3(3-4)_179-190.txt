ABSTRACT
In order to develop platinum complexes with selective activity in primary and secondary bone
malignancies and with the aim to optimize antitumor activity, platinum(II) complexes with
aminotris(methylenephosphonic acid) as bone-seeking (osteotropic) ligand have been synthesized,
characterized and tested in the cisplatin-sensitive ovarian carcinoma cell line CH1. As non-leaving diamine
ligands, which are decisive for the cellular processing of DNA adducts, cis-R,S-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine,
trans-S,S-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine and trans-R,R-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine have been used, resulting in
complexes I, 2, and 3, respectively. The cytotoxicity of the complexes under investigation decreases in the
order 3 > 2 > which is in accord with structure-activity relationships with other (cyclohexane-l,2-
diamine)platinum(II) and platinum(IV) complexes: Both trans complexes (2 and 3) display a higher in vitro
potency than the corresponding cis isomer (I), with the trans-R,R isomer (3) being the most active in this
series. In comparison to the analogous (cyclohexane-l,2-diamine)platinum(II) complexes with
bis(phosphonomethyl)aminoacetic acid as osteotropic carrier ligand, the cytotoxicity of I-3 was found to be
1.5 2 fold higher, which is explainable by a different coordination mode of the phosphonic acid ligands
(acetato versus phosphonato).

INTRODUCTION
Since the recognition of the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin (Figure 1) in the late 1960s/1,2,3,4/, thousands
of platinum complexes have been synthesized in order to develop similar drugs with improved antitumor
activity and with a better toxicological profile/5,6/. Carboplatin is the result of such attempts; it has, due to
the same diammineplatinum(lI) moiety, equivalent efficacy but milder toxicity because of the 1,1-
cyclobutanedicarboxylato leaving group.

Fig. 1" Platinum(II) complexes in worldwide clinical use: cisplatin (left), carboplatin (middle) and
oxaliplatin (right).
In the case of oxaliplatin, which has been approved in 1999 in Europe and in 2002 in the US, the
substitution of the two ammine ligands with the cyclohexane-l,2-diamine (or DACH diaminocyclohexane)
moiety led to the third platinum-based anticancer compound in worldwide clinical use with good antitumor
properties and partial lack of cross-resistance with cisplatin/7,8/. Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin; Sanofi-Synthelabo),
which has a more favorable safety profile than cisplatin, is indicated in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-
FU) and leucovorin for patients with colorectal cancer.
In order to synthesize platinum complexes with selective activity in primary and second.ary bone
malignancies such as osteosarcoma (bone tumors) as well as in lethal ossifying lung metastases and bone
metastases from tumors with other primary sites, a series of osteotropic (bone-seeking)
[(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino-:N)acetato-:O(2-)]platinum(II) complexes has been synthesized/9,10,11/.
With the aim of exploring structure-activity relationships, different, kinds of diam(m)ine ligands, which
are decisive for the cellular processing of DNA adducts, have been used (Figure 2) /12/. However, the
bis(phosphonomethyl)-substitutcd amino acetic acid (BPMAA) ligand, which has a high affinity for calcium
and calcified tissues and which is therefore responsible for the carrier-mediated transport to the mineral bone
matrix, was left unchanged in this study.

cell line CH1 decreases depending on the coordinated diam(m)ine ligand in the following order (Table 1):

In order to set up structure-activity relationships and to optimize antitumor activity of osteotropic
platinum-based complexes, we have focused on the synthesis of platinum(If) compounds with (cyclohexane-
1,2-diamine) as non-leaving diamine ligand. As bone-seeking carrier ligand a tris(phosphonic acid), ATMP,
aminotris(methylenephosphonic acid), was selected.

Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Test Conditions
The ovarian carcinoma cell line CH1, which has been established from an ascites sample of a patient with
a papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, was kindly pro'ided by Lloyd R. Kelland (CRC Centre fi)r
Cancer Therapeutics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK). Cells were grown as adherent monolayer
cultures in complete culture medium, i.e., Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and
50 pg/ml streptomycin (all purchased from Gibco). Cultures were maintained at 37 C in a humidified

atmosphere containing 5% CO..
Cytotoxicity of complexes I-3 was determined by means of a colorimetric microculture assay (MTT
assay, MTT 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide). For this purpose, CH1
cells were harvested from adherent cultures by trypsinization, and suspensions were adjusted to cell densities
of 1.25 104cells/ml in order to assure exponential growth throughout drug exposure. Aliquots of
200 tl/well of these suspensions were used to seed microcultures in 96-well plates. After incubation
24 hrs, cells were exposed to the test compounds, which were dissolved and serially diluted in complete
culture medium shortely before use. Each concentration., was given to eight microcultures in parallel. After
incubation for four days, drug soluti6ns were removed and replaced by 150 pl/well complete culture medium
and 20 tl of aqueous MTT solution (5 mg/ml). After incubation for a further 4 hrs, the medium/MTT
mixtures were removed and formazan crystals were dissolved in 150 lal of DMSO/well. Optical densities at
550 nm were measured with a microplate reader (Tecan Spectra Classic), and the quantity of living cells was
expressed as T/C values by comparison to untreated control microcultures. The concentrations of complexes
that decreased absorption by 50% were calculated by interpolation and taken as the IC.s0 values. Evaluation is
based on means of values obtained from three independent experiments.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Syntheses
Synthesis of the bis(phosphonomethyl)amino-KN)methylphosphonato-KO(2-)l(cyclohexane- 1,2-diamine-
K"N,N')platinum(ll) complexes I-3 was accomplished in three steps in analogy to the synthetic procedure of
the bis(phosphonomethyl)-substituted aminoacetatoplatinum(lI) counterparts, as described previously /12/.
The dichloro (cyclohexane-l,2-diamine) platinum(II) complexes are synthesized in one step, starting from
K2PtC14 and the cis-R,S-, trans-S,S- and trans-R,R-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine ligands. After that, the
dichloroplatinum(II) species are activated over night using silver nitrate (Scheme 1).

After removing the precipitated silver chloride, aminotris(methylenephosphonic acid), ATMP, is added,
and the bis(phosphonomethyl)amino-N)methylphosphonato-cO(2-)]platinum(II) complexes 1-3 are formed.
Purity of the compounds was checked by elemental analysis, whereas coordination of the ATMP ligand
can best be judged by 31p NMR spectroscopy.
3.2. NMR spectroscopy
In phosphorus NMR, the free ligand resonates at 9.3 ppm, whereas in complexes 1-3 a significant
downfield shift of the signals can be observed: In the region between 43.7 and 44.0 ppm, a 31p signal of the
coordinated phosphonato residue is found; resonances of the uncoordinated phosphonomethyl groups are
located between 12.7 and 13.4 ppm. In case of the (trans-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine)platinum(II) complexes 2
and 3, two signals can be detected with a separation of 0.6 ppm in the region around 13.0 ppm, reflecting the
nonequivalcnce of the uncoordinated phosphonomethyl groups. This is in accordance with the analogous
BPMAA complexes, where signals between 12.6 and 13.0 ppm could be found/12/. In the case of the cis-
R,S-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine ligand, two isomers are formed with either NH2-(CR) or NH2-(Cs) in trans
position to the coordinated phosphonato group. For this mixture, only one unresolved 3p chemical shift at
13.3 ppm could be detected.
IH and 3C resonance assignment was performed by analysis of two-dimensional 1H,H and 3C,H shift
correlated spectra, as will be demonstrated for complex 1 in the following section. Two kinds of isolated spin
systems can be detected in the H,H-COSY NMR spectrum of complex (Figure 4): (i) the protons of the
cis-cyclohexane-l,2-diamine ligand, which are separated in three regions (1.0-1.8: CH2, 2.5-3.0: CH, 4.8-6.4:
NH2) and (ii) the H resonances of ATMP coordinated to the platinum(II) center (3.3-4.0: CH2). The protons
bound to the same nitrogen were detected at 4.94, 5.43 and 5.92, 6.22 ppm, respectively, and can be
unequivocally assigned on the basis of their H,H shift correlation signals.
Starting from these resonances, a vicinal coupling to the methine protons H(4) and H(5) at 2.66 and 2.91
ppm of the cyclohexane ring can be observed. H(4) and H(5) display a distinct cross peak to the neighboring
CH2 groups H(6) and H(9) which merge to one unresolved multiplett at 1.66 ppm. Consequently, the
resonances at 1.17, 1.31 and 1.57 ppm, which are found in a ratio of 1:2:1, originate from the methylene
protons H(7) and H(8).
3C resonance assignment for complex was performed by analyzing LC,H connectivities in the two-
dimensional 3C,H-COSY NMR spectrum (Figure 5).

13C,1H-COSY NMR spectrum ofcomplex 1 in D20 (region of 3C shift correlation signals to
protons H(1), H(2), H(3), H(4) and H(5) is shown).
While interpretation of proton and 13C resonances of the cyclohexane ring is straightforward, as can be
seen in the case of H(4) and H(5), analysis of IH and 13C chemical shifts in the coordinated ATMP ligand is
more complicated: (i) The protons of each of the three CH2 groups are nonequivalent, and therefore the 1H
resonances (of protons bound to one carbon atom) are separated, by up to 0.45 ppm, with a severe
overlapping of H(2)/H(3) and H(1)/H(2)/H(3) signals. (ii) The protons as well as the 3C atoms are coupling
with the 3p nuclei. (iii) Due to the nonequivalent properties of protons bound to one carbon atom, geminal
coupling with 2j, coupling constants of about 13 Hz is observed. Moreover, these values are in the order of
magnitude of 2Jl,p coupling constants.
The 3C resonance of C(1) of the coordinated methylphosphonato moiety was found to be at 59.2 ppm,
with a J(;,I, coupling of 147 Hz and shift correlation signals to protons H(1). Only one of these H resonances
(at 3.90 ppm) is not superimposed by other proton signals and appears as an isolated triplett due to coupling
with the geminal H(1) and the neighboring 3p nucleus. 3C chemical shifts of the phosphonomethyl groups
(C(2)/C(3)) were detected at 62.4 and 63.2 ppm, with Jc,, coupling constants of 147 and 140 Hz,
respectively. Shift correlation signals to the corresponding protons (H(2)/H(3)) indicate a separation of the
resonances of geminal protons by about 0.2 ppm.

3.3. Cytotoxic Activity
The cytotoxic activity of [(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino-KN)methylphosphonato-KO(2-)](cyclohexane-
1,2-diamine-K2N,N')platinum(ll) complexes 1-3 has been compared in the highly cisplatin-sensitive human
ovarian cancer cell line CH1. Concentration-effect curves were obtained after exposure for 96 hours by
means of a colorimetric microculture assay (MTT assay). The concentration-effect curves for I-3 are shown
in Figure 6, whereas the corresponding IC.s0 values are reported in Table 2.

(cyclohexane-l,2-diamine-K N,N )platinum(ll) complexes I-3 in ovarian cancer cells (CH1) after
exposure for 96 hours.
As expected, the in vitro antitumor activity decreases depending on the stereochemistry of the cytotoxic
(cyclohexane-l,2-diamine)platinum(II) moiety in the following order: 3 > 2 > I. Both trans complexes 3 and
2 display a higher potency than the corresponding cis isomer 1, with the (SP-4-2)-
(bis(phosphonomethyl)amino-KN)methylphosphonato-KO(2-)](trans-R,R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-
KN,N')platinum(li) compound being the most active one in this series.
These findings are in good agreement with structure-activity relationships of analogous osteotropic
complexes with BPMAA as ligand (Table 1)/12/. They are also in accord with the in vitro/13,14/and in vivo
/15,16/antitumor activity of (cyclohexane-l,2-diamine)oxalatoplatinum(II) isomers (among which the trans-
R,R form, oxaliplatin, is known to be the most active) as well as with other (cyclohexane-l,2-
diamine)platinum(II) and platinum(IV) complexes.

Coordination of the bone-seeking ATMP leaving group resulted in a marked increase of cytotoxic
activity. Complexes 1-3 display an in vitro antitumor activity in the ovarian carcinoma cell line CHI which is
about 1.5 to 2 fold higher in comparison to their BPMAA analogues. The decrease in IC50 values is
explainable by an increased reactivity of the complexes due to the coordinated phosphonato residue in case of
ATMP as ligand, whereas platinum(II) complexes with BPMAA ligands (coordinated carboxylato residue)
seem to be more stable.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In order to explore structure-activity relationships, bone-seeking (cyclohexane-l,2-diamine)platinum(II)
complexes with ATMP as ligand have been synthesized and tested for their cytotoxicity in the cisplatin-
sensitive ovarian carcinoma cell line CH1. A marked improvement of in vitro antitumor potency could be
observed in comparison to analogous BPMAA complexes.
Whether the change of the phosphonic acid ligand has a positive impact on the in vivo anticancer activity
as well as on general toxicity and whether the osteotropic properties are influenced by selection of the ligand
(BPMAA versus ATMP) cannot be judged by in vitro investigations and must be clarified in appropriate
animal experiments.
