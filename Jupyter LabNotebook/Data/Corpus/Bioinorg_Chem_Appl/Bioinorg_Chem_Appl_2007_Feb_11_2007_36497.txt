1. INTRODUCTION
The interaction  and reaction of metal complexes with DNA
have long been the subject of intense investigation in relation to
the development of new reagents for biotechnology and medicine.
Studies of small molecules, which react at specific sites along a
DNA strand as reactive models for protein-nucleic acid
interactions, provide routes towards rational drug design as well
as means to develop sensitive chemical probes for DNA. A number of
metal complexes have been used as probes of DNA structure in
solution, as agents for mediation of strand scission of duplex DNA
and as chemotherapeutic agents [–]. In this regard, mixed-ligand metal complexes have been found to be particularly useful because of their potential to bind DNA
via a multitude of interactions and to cleave the duplex
by virtue of their intrinsic chemical, electrochemical, and
photochemical reactivities [–]. Prominent among the various mixed-ligand metal complexes employed so far in studies with DNA are those metallointercalators which incorporate either 2.2′-bipyridine(bpy)/1.10 phenanthroline or
a modified bipyridine/phenanthroline moiety or aromatic heterocyclic ring as a ligand. A singular advantage in using these metallointercalators for such studies is that the
ligands or the metal ion in them can be varied in an easily
controlled manner to facilitate individual applications
[–]. Although DNA interactions of number of mixed ligand complexes have previously appeared in the literature, still there is scope to design and study small molecules containing mixed ligand with the same or different metal ions as new chemical
nucleases.

In continuation of our work on studies of nuclease activity of
mixed-ligand complexes, we wish to explore the binding and
oxidative as well as photocleavage activities of mixed ligand
complexes of Co(III) and Ni(II) containing bipyridine and condensed quinoline derivative ligand.

2. EXPERIMENTAL

2.2. Synthesis of metal complexes
2.2.1. Synthesis of Co(III) and Ni(II) complexes
The complexes [Co(bpy)2Cl2]Cl · 3H2O and
[Ni(bpy)2Cl2] were prepared as reported previously [, ].

2.2.3. Synthesis of [Ni(bpy)2(qbdp)](PF6)2·2H2O (2)
A methanolic solution of [Ni(bpy)2Cl2] (0.44 g, 1 mmol) was added to a mixture of methanolic solution of qbdp
(0.245 g, 1 mmol) and ethylene glycol (25 mL). The resulting mixture was refluxed for 4 hours, allowed to cool, and then filtered. The crude complex was precipitated upon addition of saturated methanolic solution of NH4PF6 to the filtrate. The complex was filtered, further and dried under vacuum and recrystallized from an acetone-diethyl ether mixture (see
). Analysis: yield of complex
0.81 g (80%); calculated for C36H30N7O2P2F12Ni: C, 72.14; H, 4.85; N, 12.96; Ni, 10.56: Found:

2.3. Spectral measurements
Melting points were determined in open capillaries and are
uncorrected. Microanalyses (C, H, and N) were
performed in Carlo-Erba 1106-model 240 Perkin-Elmer analyzer. The
molar conductivities in DMF (10−3 M) at room temperature were measured using an Equiptronics digital conductivity meter.
Magnetic measurements were carried out by the Gouy method at room
temperature (28 ± 2°C) using
Hg[Co(SCN)4] as calibrant. IR spectra were recorded with Shimadzu model FT-IR spectrophotometer by using KBr pellets. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker FT-NMR
spectrometer (300 MHz) at 25°C in DMSO with TMS as
the internal reference. FAB-MS spectra were recorded with a JEOL
SX 102/DA-6000 mass spectrometer/data system. UV visible
absorption spectra were recorded using Shimadzu model UV
spectrophotometer at room temperature. Viscosity measurements were
carried out on semimicro dilution capillary viscometer (Viscomatic
Fica MgW) with a thermostated bath D40S at room temperature.
Thermal denaturation studies were carried out with a
Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer.

2.4. DNA binding and cleavage experiments
The concentration of CT DNA per nucleotide [C(p)] was measured by
using its known extinction coefficient at 260 nm
(6600 M−1cm−1) []. The absorbance at 260 nm (A260) and at 280 nm (A280) for CT DNA was measured to check its purity. The ratio A260/A280 was found to be 1.84, indicating that CT DNA was satisfactorily
free from protein. Buffer [5 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, tris, pH 7.2, 50 mM
NaCl] was used for the absorption, viscosity, and thermal
denaturation experiments.

Absorption titration experiments were carried out by varying the
DNA concentration (0–100 μM) and maintaining the
metal-complex concentration constant (30 μM). Absorption
spectra were recorded after each successive addition of DNA and
equilibration (approximately 10 minutes). For both the complexes
(1) and (2), the observed data were then fit in
to  to obtain the intrinsic binding constant, Kb []:

where ɛa, ɛf, and ɛb are the apparent, free, and bound
metal-complex extinction coefficients at 238 nm for
Co(III) and 332 nm for Ni(II), respectively. A plot of [DNA]/(ɛb − ɛf) versus [DNA] gave a slope of
1/(ɛb − ɛf) and a y intercept equal to 
1/Kb(ɛb − ɛf), where Kb is the ratio of the slope to the y intercept.

Viscosity measurements were carried out using a semimicro dilution
capillary viscometer at room temperature. Each experiment was
performed three times and an average flow time was calculated.
Data were presented as (η/ηo) versus binding ratio, where η is the viscosity of DNA in the presence of complex and ηo is the viscosity of DNA alone.

Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out by monitoring
the absorption of CT DNA (50 μM) at 260 nm at various
temperatures in the presence (5–10 μM) and the absence
of each complex. The melting temperature (Tm, the
temperature at which 50% of double-stranded DNA becomes
single-stranded) and the curve width (σT, the
temperature range between which 10% and 90% of the absorption
increases occurred) were calculated as reported [, ].

The extent of cleavage of super coiled (SC) pUC19 DNA
(0.5 μL, 0.5 μg) to its nicked circular (NC) form was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.2) containing NaCl (50 mM). In the cleavage reactions, the 30 μM and 20 μM complexes in 18 μL buffer were photoirradiated using monochromatic UV or visible light. The samples were then incubated
for 1 hour at 37°C followed by addition to the loading
buffer containing 25% bromophenolblue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 30% glycerol (3 μL), and finally loaded on 0.8% agarose gel containing 1.0 μg/mL ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was carried out at 50 V for 2 hours in Tris-borate EDTA (TBE)
buffer. Bands were visualized by UV light and photographed to
determine the extent of DNA cleavage from the intensities of the
bands using UVItec Gel Documentation System. Due corrections were
made for the trace of NC DNA present in the SC DNA sample and for
the low affinity of EB binding to SC DNA in comparison to the NC
form. The wavelength used for the photo-induced DNA cleavage
experiments were 365 nm.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Characterization of complexes
The elemental analysis data, IR, 1H NMR, and magnetic moment
data of the new complexes are summarized in
.
These data agreed with the theoretical values within the limit of
experimental error. These new complexes are insoluble in water,
but they are soluble in DMF, DMSO, and in buffer (pH 7.2)
solution. The conductometric measurement values in DMF
 indicate their nonelectrolytic nature.

The IR spectra of ligand qbdp show a strong band in the range
3450 cm−1 assigned to γ(NH) group. In Co(III) and Ni(II) complexes, this band is absent due to by-coordination of nitrogen atom to the metal ion. Besides,
the complexes show new bands at 420 cm−1 for
(M−N) bond. In addition, the IR spectrum of the PF6
salt of each complex showed a strong band in the region
837–839 cm−1 ascribable to the counter anion and this
band was absent for the corresponding chloride salts []. In the 1H NMR spectra of the Co(III) complex, the peaks due to various protons of bpy and qbdp ligands are seen to be
shifted in complexation with corresponding free ligands,
suggesting complexation. Unlike the cobalt(III) complexes, which
are diamagnetic, nickel(II) complex was found to be paramagnetic
with μeff value of 2.77 ± 0.02 B.M. as expected for typical d8 system.

3.2. DNA binding experiments
3.2.1. Absorption spectral studies
In the presence of increasing amounts of CT DNA, both complexes
showed hypochromicity and red-shifted charge transfer peak maxima
in the absorption spectra. For complexes (1) and
(2), the hypochromicity observed in the presence of DNA
were 22 and 13%, and the bathochromic shifts were 2 and 1 nm
(Figures  and ), respectively. The binding constants calculated using  are  summarized in . The observed Kb values for Co(III) and Ni(II) complexes are equal to
classical intercalators [EthBr, Kb,
1.8 × 106 M−1 in 25 mM
Tris-HCl/40 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.9) and partial intercalating  metal complexes [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+, dppz =
dipyrido-[3,2-d: 2′,3′-f]-phenazine,
Kb &gt; 106 M−1] bound to CT-DNA. So it is obvious that the present complexes are involved in interacalative
interactions with CT-DNA. These strongest binding affinities exhibited by these complexes are expected on the basis of the additional aromatic nature of new qbdp ligand.

3.2.2. Viscosity measurements
Furthermore, the interactions between the complex and
DNA were investigated by viscosity measurements. Optical
photophysical probes provided necessary, but not sufficient, clues
to support a binding model. Hydrodynamic measurements that were
sensitive to leangth change (i.e., viscosity and sedimentation)
were regarded as the least ambiguous and the most critical tests
of binding mode in solution in the absence of crystallographic
structural data [, ]. A classical intercalation model usually resulted in lengthening the DNA helix, as base pairs were separated to accommodate the binding ligand leading to the
increase of DNA viscosity. As seen in , the viscosity of DNA increased as increasing the ratio of both
Co(III) and Ni(II) complexes to DNA. This result further suggested an intercalative binding mode of the complex
with DNA and also paralled to the above spectroscopic
results, such as hyposhromism and bathochromism of
complexes in the presence of DNA.

3.2.3. Thermal denaturation studies
The DNA thermal melting is a measure of the stability of the DNA
double helix with temperature; an increase in the thermal melting
temperature (Tm) indicates an interaction between DNA
and the metal complex. In the present case, thermal melting
studies were carried out at DNA to complex concentration ratios of
25 and Tm and σT (the temperature range between which 10% and 90% of the absorption increase occurred) values were determined by monitoring the absorbance of DNA at
260 nm as a function of temperature. As shown in
, the Tm of DNA in the absence of any added drug was found to be 60 ± 1°C,
under our experimental conditions. Under the same set of
conditions, the presence of complexes (1) and
(2) increased the Tm by 4 and 2°C, respectively, and the values are given in .

3.2.4. Cleavage studies by chemical oxidation
The oxidative DNA cleavage activity of the complexes
was studied by gel electrophoresis using super coiled (SC) pUC19
DNA (0.5 μg) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH, 7.2). Both complexes exhibited nuclease activity
(, lanes 3-4). Control experiment using DNA
alone does not show any apparent cleavage (lane 1). At the
concentration for 30 μM and 40 μM, the complex (1) is able to convert 36% and 71% of the initial SC (Form I) to NC (nicked circular) (Form II), respectively (lanes 3
and 4). Whereas, the complex (2) is able to convert 66%
of the initial SC (Form I) to NC (Form II) at the concentration of
20 μM (lane 5). From these results, we infer that the
complex (1) shows more cleavage activity than the complex
(2). However, the nature of reactive intermediates
involved in the DNA cleavage by the complexes has not been clear yet.

3.3. DNA photocleavage
The photo-induced DNA cleavage activity of the complexes was
studied by gel electrophoresis using supercoiled (SC) pUC19 DNA
(0.5 μg) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH, 7.2). Selected DNA cleavage data are given in , and the gel diagrams are shown in . The complex (1) (30 μM in 18 μL volume) shows 66% cleavage of the SC DNA, whereas complex (2) (20 μM in 18 μL volume) shows 37% of cleavage on 1 hour exposure at 365 nm. Control experiments using qbdp ligand alone do not show any significant cleavage of SC DNA even on long
exposure time. The results indicate the important role of metal in
these photo-induced DNA cleavage reactions. The complexes show the
presence of charge-transfer band near 400 nm. It is likely
that the photocleavage at 365 nm involves photoexcitation of
the charge-transfer band leading to the formation of an excited
singlet state that through the triplet state activates molecular
oxygen to form reactive singlet oxygen species. To test the
possibility that photoinduced cleavage involves the formation of
singlet oxygen, which is known to react with guanine residues at
nuetral pH, the cleavage was tested in the presence of
D2O. Singlet oxygen would be expected to induce more strand scission in D2O than in H2O due to its
longer lifetime in the former solvent [–]. Control
experiments show that the singlet oxygen quencher sodium azide
significantly inhibits the cleavage reaction, while the hydroxyl
radical scavenger DMSO has no apparent effect on the cleavage
process. The formation of singlet oxygen is further supported by
the enhancement of the percentage of SC DNA cleavage in
D2O solvent. From the above results, we conclude that in the photocleavage activity of complexes (1) and
(2) at 365 nm, complex (1) shows
significantly higher cleavage activity than complex (2)
based on its DNA binding propensity.

4. CONCLUSION
The new mixed ligand cobalt(III) and nickel(II) complexes have
been synthesized and characterized. The DNA binding properties of
these two complexes were studied by using absorption spectra,
viscosity, and thermal denaturation experiments. The results show
that the complexes were interacting with the CT-DNA. We also
carried out the DNA cleavage by oxidative as well as
photo-irradiations. The cleavage study results show that the
Co(III) complex is
more nuclease than the Ni(II) complex.
