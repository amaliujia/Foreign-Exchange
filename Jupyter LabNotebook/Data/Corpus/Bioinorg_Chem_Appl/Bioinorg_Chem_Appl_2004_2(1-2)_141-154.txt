ABSTRACT
A series of triorganophosphinegold(1) dithiocarbamate (R3PAuS2CNR'2) and xanthate (R3PAuS:COR')
complexes have been prepared and characterised spectroscopically. Based on crystallographic evidence, the
molecules feature linear gold(1) geometries defined by sulphur and phosphorus donors. The complexes, along
with a series of known anti-cancer agents, have been screened against a panel of seven human cancer cell
lines. Uniformly, the dithiocarbamate derivatives are more active than their xanthate counterparts, with the
most active complex being Et3PAu(S:CNEt2), and are more active than cisplatin in all cell lines screened but,
not as potent as taxol.

INTRODUCTION
Amongst the l,l-dithiolate ligands, dithiocarbamates, SzCNR2, comprise a group of ligands with great
binding potential to metals and as such find wide use in coordination chemistry. Their synthesis is relatively
simple with the most common method of preparation involving the reaction of carbon disulphide, in the
presence of a base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, with any one of a large range of primary and
secondary amines/1, 2/. Dithiocarbamates and their metal complexes have a wide variety of applications.
Their most common use is as pesticides, e.g. zineb, [Zn(SzCN(H)CH2CHzN(H)CS:)],, maneb,
[Mn(SCN(H)CH2CH2N(H)CSz)]n, ziram, Zn(SzCNMe2)2, and thiram, Me2NC(=S)SSC(=S)NMe:, and this
application has led to the development of new analytical techniques that were designed to determine the
concentrations of these pesticides as well as their degradation products/2 4/. In addition, these species have
important applications in the production of petroleum derivatives, lubricants and polymers, where they are

Dithiocarbamates
used as accelerators for vulcanization, anti-oxidants and anti-humidity agents/5 7/. Some dithiocarbamate
ligands are excellent reagents for the analysis oftrace metals by means ofenhancement techniques/8/.
Dithiocarbamates are well known as heavy-metal chelating agents with a strong affinity for many divalent
cations, as well as the heavier elements, and possess various biological activities. For example, their
chelating abilities can cause the inhibition of numerous metal-containing enzymes, such as copper-containing
dopamine-13-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, and cytochrome oxidase/9/.
An approved agent given to human patients with alcohol-abuse problems is disulfram (Antabuse(R)), i.e.
Et2NC(-S)SSC(-S)NEt2 /10/. Diethyldithiocarbamate has had extensive clinical use in the treatment of
Wilson's disease, i.e. copper poisoning, and a variety of other heavy-metal poisoning/11/. During the past
decade, there has been considerable interest in the possible use of dithiocarbamate ligands in the treatment of
cancer with ionizing radiation/12/. It is thought that diethyldithiocarbamate enhances radiation sensitivity
owing to its inhibition of SOD, as mentioned above/12/. Over and above this, diethyldithiocarbamate has
shown anti-cancer effects in its own right/9/. For example, diethyldithiocarbamate can reduce alkylation of
DNA by nitrosamines /13/ and it can inhibit tumour induction by the cancer inducing agent benzo[a]pyrene
/14/. Finally, dithiocarbamate has been shown to be effective in the reduction of several secondary effects
associated with chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin/15/. Thus, nephrotoxicity may be reduced/16/by
its complexing with platinum-enzyme adducts formed in the kidney /17/ and myelosuppression may be
moderated/18/. It is thought that it is the inhibition of diethyldithiocarbamate metabolism by the microsomal
mixed oxygenase system that is responsible for its reduction of carcinogenic effects and toxic side-effects
associated with chemotherapy/19/. Indeed, there is a suggestion that diethyldithiocarbamate is unique among
potential cisplatin chemoprotectors in the selectivity of its reactions with cisplatin or more precisely, with its
metabolites. Finally, diethyldithiocarbamate has been reported to inhibit progression of HIV implicated in
AIDS/20, 21/. A related dithiocarbamate ligand, i.e. pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, (-S2CN(CH2)4), is also of
biological importance as it was found to inhibit NF-KB-related gene-expression/22/.
Among the various different classes of metal complexes currently investigated for their applications in
medicine, dithiocarbamate complexes demonstrate outstanding potential/23/. The potential medical uses of
dithiocarbamate complexes include: anti-viral agents, e.g. heterocyclic dithiocarbamates of ruthenium(Ill)
/24/, antidotes for preventing the effects of phytotoxic agents, e.g. copper dithiocarbamates/25/, bactericides
and anti-microbial agents, e.g. triorganotin dithiocarbamates/26/, anti-tumour agents, notably of palladium
and platinum/27-31/as well as tin dithiocarbamates/32, 33/, anti-parasitic agents, e.g. platinum, iridium and
rhodium /34/, and prophylactic or therapeutic agents for metal toxicity, e.g. for cadmium /35/. Iron
dithiocarbamates have been used for treating AIDS and neurodegenerative diseases/36/. As an extension of
the aforementioned medical applications of dithiocarbamate ligands and their metal complexes, this
contribution describes a study where dithiocarbamates have been combined with phosphinegold(1) entities
with the view of exploring their anti-tumour potential.
Gold thiolates, including a phosphinegold(1) thiolate, auranofin, are used in the treatment of arthritis/37,
38/, usually after other therapies have been exhausted. The examination of the potential anti-tumour activity
of gold complexes is a more recent phenomenon and has been demonstrated in a number of experimental
models but, as yet, no gold compound has entered clinical trials. Auranofin and analogues were shown fo be

cytotoxic towards B 16 melanoma and P388 leukaemia in vivo, early standards in anti-cancer screening/39/.
The development ofgold complexes as anti-tumour agents has been reviewed recently/40/.
The focus of our investigations in this field has been upon the potential anti-tumour activity of
phosphinegold(l) thiolates, i.e. auranofin analogues /41/. A particular emphasis has been to couple
biologically active thiols with phosphinegold(l) entities in the hope that upon administration of the 'pro-
drug', both the phosphinegold(l) entity and thiol would provide therapeutic benefit /42, 43/. As a
continuation upon this theme, we present here the results of in vitro cytotoxicity screening for a range of
phosphinegold(1) dithiocarbamate complexes, a study motivated by the combination of biologically active
dithiocarbamates with phosphinegold(1). In addition, a smaller number of phosphinegold(1) dithiocarbonate
(-S2COR, xanthate) complexes are included in this study. Xanthates and their metal complexes have not been
evaluated for biological activity to the same extent as dithiocarbamates. However, xanthate complexes of tin
have demonstrated some potential as anti-tumour agents/44/and certain phosphinegold(1) dithiocarbonate
complexes have proved to possess some anti-arthritic activity/45/. The results of this study are reported
herein.
EXPERIMENTAL
General
The R3PAuC! starting materials were prepared according to the literature method/46/. All solvents were
of analytical grade (J. T. Baker) and used as supplied. NaSCNEtz.3H20 (Tuka) and NH4S2CNCnH8 (Aldrich)
were used as supplied. Potassium xanthates were prepared from the reaction of the alcohol (that also served
as the solvent), CSz and KOH. 1H, and 13C{IH} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ACF300 FT NMR
spectrometer, with chemical shifts relative to tetramethylsilane. 3p{H} NMR data were recorded on the
same instrument but with chemical shifts recorded relative to 85% aqueous H3PO4. IR spectra were obtained
as KBr pellets on a Bio-Rad FTSI65 FTIR spectrophotometer. ESI mass spectra were measured on a
Finnigan MAT95XL-T spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin Elmer PE 2400 CHN
Elemental Analyser.

To a dichloromethane solution (4 ml) of R3PAuCI was added an equimolar amount (based on gold
content) of dithiolate ligand. The colourless solution immediately turned yellow, indicating the formation of
the product, and was stirred for 2 h. The yellow solution was filtered through Celite and concentrated to
approximately ml to yield the product.

Cytotoxicity Screening
The test and reference compounds were dissolved to a concentration of250 000 ng/ml in full medium, by
20 fold dilution of a stock solution which contained mg compound/200 tl. The trial complexes (!)- (10)
were taken into DMSO. However, it was noted that (2), (4) and (5) did not dissolve completely, even when
heated to 60 C. Cytotoxicity was estimated by the microculture sulforhodamine B (SRB) test /57/. The
human cancer cell lines examined in the present study were: A498, renal cancer; MCF-7, estrogen receptor
(ER)+/progesterone receptor (PgR)+; EVSA-T, estrogen receptor (ER)-/progesterone receptor (PgR)-; H226,
non-small cell lung cancer; IGROV, ovarian cancer; MI9 MEL, melanoma; and WIDR, colon cancer.
The experiment was started on day 0. On day 0, 150 lal oftrypsinized tumor cells (I 500 2000 cells/well)
were plated in 96-wells flatbottom microtiter plates (falcon 3072, DB). The plates were preincubated 48 hrs
at 37 C, 8.5 % CO2 to allow the cells to adhere. On day 2, a three-fold dilution sequence of ten steps was
made in full medium, starting with the 250 000 ng/ml stock solution. Every dilution was used in
quadruplicate by adding 50 lal to a column of four wells. This results in a highest concentration of 62 5000
ng/ml present in column 12. Column 2 was used for the blank. To column 1, PBS was added to diminish
interfering evaporation. On day 7, the incubation was terminated by washing the plate twice with PBS.
Subsequently, the cells were fixed with 10 % trichloroacetic acid in PBS and placed at 4 C for one hour.

Dithiocarbamates
After five washings with tap water, the cells were stained for at least 15 minutes with 0.4 % SRB dissolved in
1% acetic acid. After staining, the cells were washed with 1% acetic to remove the unbound stain. The
plates were air-dried and the bound stain was dissolved in 150 gl 10 mM Tris-base. The absorbance was read
at 540 nm using an automated microplate reader (Labsystems. Multiskan MS). Data were used for
construction of concentration-response curves and determination of the IDs0 value by use of Deltasofl 3
software.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A series of phosphinegold(1) l,l-dithiolates have been prepared and characterised spectroscopically.
Physical data are presented in Table and the spectroscopic results, that confirm the formation of the
complexes, are summarised in Tables 2 4. The crystal structure of a representative complex has been
undertaken.
The molecular structure of (p-MeOC6H4)aPAu(S2COiPr) (10) is shown in Fig. and selected geometric
parameters are collected in the caption to this figure. The gold atom exists in the expected linear geometry
defined by S and P donor atoms with the Au-S distance being significantly longer than the Au-P distance.
The small deviation from the ideal linear angle at gold (S-Au-P is 176.75(5)) may be traced to the close
approach of the non-coordinating $2 atom that is separated 3.2856(16) ,& from the gold atom. Arguably the
most significant intermolecular contacts are of the type C-H...O. Thus, C16-H...O2 is 2.47 A, C16...O2 is
3.319(6) A and the angle at H is 149,and CI7-H...O3" is 2.37 A, CI7...O3" is 3.292(5) A and the angle at
H is 163 for symmetry operations i: l-x, -y, IA+z and ii: -%+x, -1A-y, z. Similar coordination geometries have
been reported for related phosphinegold(1) xanthates /59 65/ and there is no evidence to suggest that
different structures are found for (8) and (9). The molecular geometry found for (10) is also as expected for
their phosphinegold(1) dithiocarbamate analogues/58/and indeed, the crystal structures of (2)/47/, (3)/48/
and (5)/49/have been reported separately.

The phosphinegold(1) dithiocarbamates, (1)- (7), and xanthates, (8)- (10), have been evaluated for their
cytotoxicity against a panel of seven human cancer cell lines. The following cell lines were used: A498, renal
cancer; MCF-7, estrogen receptor (ER)+/progesterone receptor (PgR)+; EVSA-T, estrogen receptor (ER)-
/progesterone receptor (PgR)-; H226, non-small cell lung cancer; |GROV, ovarian cancer; M l9 MEL,
melanoma; and WIDR, colon cancer. The A498, H226, IGROV, M 19 MEL, WIDR cell lines are included in
the current anti-cancer screening panel of the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A. /66/. The cytotoxicity
screening results for (!) (10) are given in Table 5 as well as those for a series of standard anti-cancer
agents. From the data presented in Table 5, several trends may be discerned.
The two dithiocarbamate iigands chosen for evaluation were featured in the Introduction owing to their
known biological relevance. Amongst the diethyldithiocarbamates, the EtaP derivative (l) was the most
active. The CyaP species (2) has comparable cytotoxicity to (l) and both are more potent than the (p-
MeOC6H4)aP derivative (3). The complex containing the bidentate phosphine ligand dppf, where dppf is |, l'-
bis(diphenylphosphine)ferrocene, that gives rise to a dinuclear gold species (4), has the poorest cytotoxicity,
in particular considering it contains approximately twice the amount of gold as do the other species. The
second dithiocarbamate series contains the pyrrolinedithiocarbamate ligand. Of the three complexes, (5)-
(7), the PhaP species (6) is the most potent. The CyP complex (5) is less cytotoxic against all cell lines
compared with the diethyldithiocarbamate analogue (2) but the reverse is true for the dppf derivatives in five
cell lines, i.e. A498, MCF-7, EVSA-T, M I9 and W|DR. Such a non-systematic variation underscores the
difficulty in generating a structure/activity relationship in these compounds. Amongst the xanthate,
PhaPAu(SzCOR), complexes, R (CHz).CH3 (8) and CHzCHzOCH3 (9) had comparable potency to each
other and both were more cytotoxic than (p,MeOC6H4)PAu(S2COiPr) (10). As a class of complex, the
xanthates are generally less cytotoxic than their dithiocarbamate analogues. The greatest potency exhibited
by the xanthate complexes was against the ovarian cancer cell line |GROV but, it is noted that the range of
IDa0 values against all cell lines is not great suggesting little, if any, specificity in their cytotoxicity profile.
The greatest potency exhibited by the dithiocarbamate complexes was also evident against the IGROV cell
line and comparable activities were also found against the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and EVSA-T. The
cytotoxicity results for the phosphinegold(1) I,l-dithiolates can be compared with those obtained for a
selection of known anti-cancer agents.

It is clear from the data presented in Table 5 that several of the phosphinegold(1) dithiocarbamates and
even xanthates had greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin in the cell lines evaluated. For the cell lines in which
the dithiocarbamate complexes were particularly cytotoxic, i.e. IGROV, MCF-7 and EVSA-T, the IDso
values were lower than those obtained for both 5-flurouracil and etoposide. Clearly, anti-cancer agents such
as doxorubicin, methotrexate and taxol demonstrate greater cytotoxicity than the phosphinegold(1) l,l-
dithiolates.

Dithiocarbamates
CONCLUSIONS
Phosphinegold(l) dithiocarbamates display cytotoxicity profiles greater than that exhibited by cisplatin
against a range of human cancer cell lines. The most potent complex overall was Et3PAu(S2CNEt2) which
was most active against the IGROV (ovarian cancer) cell line. The dithiocarbamate complexes had greater
potency than the corresponding xanthate complexes.
