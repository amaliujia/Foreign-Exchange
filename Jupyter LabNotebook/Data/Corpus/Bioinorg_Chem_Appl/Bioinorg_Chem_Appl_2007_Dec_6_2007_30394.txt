1. INTRODUCTION
Metal complexes of peptides are
promising and frequently used models of the active centres of various metalloenzymes.
The high metal binding affinity of peptide ligands generally requires the
presence of strongly coordinating side chain residues including the carboxylate
and imidazole functions of aspartyl and histidyl residues, respectively. The
metal ion speciation of these systems and the structural parameters of the
predominating species, however, significantly depend on the amino acid
sequences of the peptides. The most common features of the coordination
chemistry of peptides have already been reviewed by several authors [, ] and
the governing roles of histidyl and aspartyl or glutamyl residues have also
been discussed recently [, ]. A great number of studies revealed the enhanced
stability of peptide complexes containing the histidine amino acid close to the
terminal amino groups, for example, the
Xaa-His-Xaa-Xaa and Xaa-Xaa-His-Xaa sequences [, ]. In the case of the
terminally protected peptides, the anchoring role of internal histidyl residues
has been well documented and various forms of amide-bonded complexes have been
characterized [–]. More recently, the copper(II) complexes of multihistidine
peptides have also been investigated and the formation of macrochelates
suggested [–]. The peptide fragments of the hormone thymopoietin served as
the simplest models to study the effect of side chain carboxylate functions on
the complex formation processes of peptides [, ]. It was found that the
presence of -carboxylate
functions of aspartyl residues always results in the enhanced thermodynamic
stability of peptide complexes and in the case of the Xaa-Xaa-Asp-Xaa sequences
the coordination of -carboxylate-O
donor is able to prevent the deprotonation of subsequent amide functions. A
systematic study on tetrapeptides containing more aspartyl residues came to
similar conclusions []. The metal binding abilities of the peptides of aspartyl
and glutamyl residues were compared recently and the stabilizing role of -carboxylate functions of aspartyl residues was
demonstrated over that of the -carboxylate groups of glutamic acid []. The
versatility of the complex formation processes of aspartyl and glutamyl
peptides can be further enhanced by the involvement of the side chain
carboxylates in amide binding. The terminal and amide donor functions are
separated in these peptides and it generally results in very complicated
solution equilibria including the formation of polynuclear species [, ]. The
complexity of these systems is best exemplified by the metal ion interactions
of glutathione []. On the other hand, only a few papers have been published
on the complex formation processes of peptides containing both histidyl and
aspartyl residues. The tetrapeptide HisValGlyAsp corresponds to the 78–81 amino
acid fragment of the zinc binding site of the enzyme CuZn-SOD [] and its
copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes were studied by potentiometric and
spectroscopic methods both for the free and terminally protected peptides. The
data revealed the governing role of histidyl residue in the complexation
processes with a slight stability enhancement from the aspartyl moiety [–].
The active centre of the enzyme, however, contains more than one histidyl
residues, while the effect of aspartic acid is more pronounced if it is located
in internal position. Now in this paper we report the synthesis and the results
obtained for the copper(II) complexes of four new peptide ligands: (a) the
terminally protected pentapeptides
including one aspartyl and two histidyl moieties, Ac-HisHisValGlyAsp-NH2 (Ac-HHVGD-NH2), Ac-HisValGlyAspHis-NH2 (Ac-HVGDH-NH2),
and (b) the terminally free peptides containing internal aspartyl and
C-terminal histidyl residues, PheAspAlaHis (FDAH) and ValIleAspAlaHis (VIDAH).

2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Materials
The peptides Ac-HisHisValGlyAsp-NH2 (abbreviated as Ac-HHVGD-NH2), Ac-HisValGlyAspHis-NH2 (Ac-HVGDH-NH2),
PheAspAlaHis (FDAH), and ValIleAspAlaHis (VIDAH) were
synthesized in the solid state using 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin and its
modified form (H-Linker-CLTR resin). All solvents and chemicals used for
synthesis were from commercial sources in the highest available purity and used
without further purification. The resins and the protected amino acids (Fmoc–His(–Mtt)–OH, Fmoc–Val–OH, Fmoc–Gly–OH,
Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-OH, Fmoc–Phe–OH, Fmoc–Ala–OH, and Fmoc–Ile–OH were purchased
from CBL Chemical Ltd., (Patras, Greece) and details of the peptide synthesis
have already been described [].

A stock solution of copper(II)
chloride was prepared from analytical grade reagent and the concentration was
checked gravimetrically via the
precipitation of oxinate.

2.2. Potentiometric measurements
The pH-potentiometric titrations in the pH range 2.5–11.5 were
performed in 3 cm3 samples in the concentration range – mol dm−3 at 1 : 2,
1 : 1, and 2 : 1 metal ion to ligand ratios. The measurements were made with a
MOLSPIN pH meter equipped with a 6.0234.100 combined electrode (Metrohm) and a
MOL-ACS microburette controlled by computer.

The
titrations were performed with carbonate-free stock solution of potassium
hydroxide of known concentration. During the titration argon was bubbled
through the samples to ensure the absence of oxygen and carbon dioxide and for
stirring of the solutions. All pH-potentiometric measurements were carried out
at a constant ionic strength of 0.2 M KCl and at a constant temperature (298 K). The number of experimental points reached around 50 to 70 data (cm3-pH) for each titration curve. The pH readings
were converted into hydrogen ion concentration as described earlier [].
Protonation constants of the ligands and the overall stability constants () of the complexes
were calculated by means of general computational programs, PSEQUAD []and
SUPERQUAD [] using () as follows 

2.3. Spectroscopic studies
UV-Vis spectra of the copper(II) complexes were recorded on a Hewlett
Packard HP 8453 diode array and on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 double beam
spectrophotometer in the same concentration range as used for pH-potentiometry. The EPR continuous wave spectra were recorded at 120 K
in a Varian E109 spectrometer
operated at the X-band and equipped with a cryostat of Oxford Instruments.
Experimental conditions: microwave power 20 mW, modulation amplitude 10 G, and sweep
width 2000 G. The concentration of copper(II) and peptides were the same as used
for pH-potentiometry.

CD spectra of
copper(II) complexes were recorded on a JASCO J-81 spectropolarimeter using 1
or 10 mm cells in the 200–800 nm range in the same concentration range as used
for potentiometry. CD spectra of the individual species were calculated by the
same general program (PSEQUAD) as used for the evaluation of potentiometric
measurements.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Protonation constants of the
ligands
Protonation macroconstants of the
ligands have been determined by pH-potentiometric measurements and the
equilibrium data are collected in .

It is clear
from  that the peptides have 3 or 4 protonation sites which can be
assigned to the terminal amino and carboxylate groups and the side chain
imidazole and -carboxylate
functions. In agreement with the common oligopeptides the terminal amino groups
are the most basic sites of the molecules, while the C-terminal -carboxylic
groups are the most acidic. Taking into account the small differences of the
stepwise pK values, the unambiguous assignment of the protonation sites would
require the determination of microscopic protonation constants. In the case of
the terminally protected peptides these values have already been reported [] and
the data revealed the complete overlap in the basicity of the two imidazole
moieties.

3.2. Copper(II)
complexes of the terminally protected peptides (Ac-HHVGD-NH2 and
Ac-HVGDH-NH2)
The stability
constants of the copper(II) complexes of all peptides were determined by
potentiometric measurements and the data are collected in . The terminal
amino groups of peptides are the most common anchors for metal binding and, as
a consequence, the complex formation processes of the terminally free and
protected peptides are significantly different and the results are discussed in
separate subsections.

It is clear
from  that the complex formation processes of the two terminally
protected peptides Ac-HHVGD-NH2 and Ac-HVGDH-NH2 are very
similar to each other and much simpler than those of the free peptides. The
speciation is shown for the copper(II)-Ac-HHVGD-NH2 system in
, but a very similar speciation can be drawn also for Ac-HVGDH-NH2.  clearly
demonstrates that complex formation starts in a slightly acidic pH range, above
pH 3.5 when only the imidazole functions can be protonated. Thus, the species
[CuHL] and [CuL] can be characterized by the binding of imidazole-N donor
atoms, in the forms of monodentate imidazole binding  and
macrochelate , respectively. The stability constants
calculated for the Cu- binding mode [log K(Cu + HL) values in ] are slightly higher than those of simple monohistidine peptides []
suggesting that the β-carboxylate
functions of aspartyl residues also have a slight contribution to metal
binding. The data obtained for the macrochelates show similar tendencies if
they are compared to those of the copper(II) complexes of the corresponding
bis-histidine peptides [, ].

The
spectroscopic parameters of the major species are collected in  and
support the above-mentioned conclusions. In the case of the species [CuL] both
the absorption maxima and EPR parameters agree well with those of 2N
coordinated complexes in a slightly distorted environment. No measurable CD
spectra can be recorded in these systems below pH 5 and it provides an
unambiguous proof for the exclusive binding of imidazole-N donor atoms in the
species [CuHL] and [CuL]. On the other hand, characteristic CD spectra can be
recorded in parallel with the formation of the [] species
supporting that the extra deprotonation reactions come from the metal ion
coordination of the deprotonated amide functions and mixed hydroxo complexes
are not present in measurable concentration.

The metal
binding sites of the ligands in the species [CuH−nL] can be
described by the

 coordination modes ( = 1–3) containing increasing number of amide nitrogen
donor atoms. The pK(/−1) values reveal that
the deprotonation of amide functions takes place in consecutive reactions while
the cooperative deprotonation of the first two amide functions was
characteristic of many other histidine containing peptides []. However, in the
case of these ligands only one of the imidazole residues takes part in the
formation of chelate ring with the amide function and the other histidine can
occupy the free coordination sites creating a macrochelate structure which
stabilizes the species [CuH−1L]. The
spectroscopic data strongly support that the macrochelate is present in the
[CuH−2L]
species, too. The comparison of UV-Vis and EPR parameters in  with those
of the 
coordinated complexes of prion peptide fragments containing only one histidyl
residues [, ] reveals the increase in the number of coordinated nitrogen
donors suggesting th
binding mode for the [CuH−2L] species
of Ac-HHVGD-NH2 and Ac-HVGDH-NH2. This coordination mode
suppresses the deprotonation of the third amide functions to a more alkaline pH
range (pH &gt; 9) than it was reported for other histidine peptides (pH &lt;
9). The pK(−2/−3) value is
especially high for the ligand Ac-HHVGD-NH2, but in this case,
starting from the histidyl residues, the amide functions can be deprotonated
only towards the C-terminus in the form of (7,5,5)-membered fused chelates while
they are (6,5,5)-membered ones for the other ligands. It is also important to
note that various coordination isomers of the species [CuH−1L] and
[CuH−2L] can
exist because there are several possibilities for the deprotonation of the
first two amide functions of both ligands. It is demonstrated by  where
the metal binding sites of the various coordination isomers are indicated by
different squares and circles. The results of our previous studies [] on the
copper(II) complexes of multihistidine peptides revealed that the spectroscopic
parameters of these coordination isomers are very similar to each other. As a
consequence, we cannot estimate the ratio of the various isomers in solution,
but previous studies definitely support that the isomers built up from 6- and 5-membered
chelates predominate over the 7-membered ones.

In
the previous paragraph the equilibrium and spectroscopic data reported for the
species [CuHL] and [CuL] revealed the stabilization role of -carboxylate function in the Cu– binding mode. On the contrary, the comparison of the recent data obtained for
the species [CuL] with
those reported for peptides without additional carboxylate functions suggests
that β-carboxylate
groups of aspartyl residues do not have a significant contribution to the
overall stability and structural parameters of amide-bonded complexes.

3.3. Copper(II)
complexes of the terminally free peptides (FDAH and VIDAH)
The metal ion
speciation of the copper(II)-FDAH system is shown in  at two
different metal ion to ligand ratios. It is clear from  and 
that both mono- and di-nuclear complexes are formed in this system, thus the
peptide is able to keep more than one equivalent of copper(II) ion in solution
even under alkaline conditions.

The complexation starts in slightly acidic solution below pH 4 with the formation
of the protonated complex [CuHL]. The amino groups are generally the primary
ligating sites of the non-protected peptides [, ], thus the amino and
neighbouring carbonyl groups are bonded in this species, while the imidazolium
group remains protonated. The concentration of [CuHL] is, however, very low at
any metal ion to ligand ratios and the exact spectral parameters cannot be
determined. The formation of the species [CuL] is accompanied with the
appearance of detectable CD extrema (see  for spectral parameters)
suggesting that formation of [CuL] from [CuHL] is not simply the deprotonation
of the imidazolium group, but it is the deprotonation of the first amide
function and the real stoichiometry of [CuL] is [Cu(H−1L)H]. The
outstanding stability of the (NH2, N−,-COO−) coordination
mode has already been reported in several other peptides and the stability
constant of such a species is around 2  units []. Correcting the  value with the pK of imidazole of
FDAH  K = can be calculated for [Cu(H−1L)H]
supporting the above-mentioned coordination mode. It is also a common feature
of the peptides with Xaa-Asp-Xaa sequences, that the deprotonation of the
second amide functions is significantly suppressed as compared to those of the
common oligopeptides. Namely, the pK(–1/–2) = 9.64 was
reported for the tetrapeptide ADAA [], which is in a very good agreement with
our data in . As a consequence, the species [CuH−1L] will
predominate in a wide pH range including the physiological values. Its
stability constant is, however, higher than the characteristic 2  units,
because the deprotonated side chain imidazole can occupy the fourth
coordination site around the metal ion. This assumption is supported by the
slight blue shift of the absorption maxima upon the formation of [CuH−1L] from
[CuL].

A
further base consuming process is detected above pH 9, when both amino and
imidazole nitrogen donors are coordinated. The significant blue shift of the
absorption maxima and characteristic changes of CD spectra unambiguously prove
the coordination of the second amide nitrogens, but in the forms of various
coordination isomers. These isomers can include the (NH2, N−, N−, )
coordination mode starting from the N-terminus (see ) and the (, N	−, N−, (NH2))
coordination mode starting from the C-terminal histidyl residues (see ).
The determination of the exact ratios of the isomers would require the study of
the copper(II) complexes of some model peptides, but the comparison of the CD spectra
of copper(II)-FDAH with those reported for other histidine
peptides [] suggests that the metal binding from the histidyl site may predominate
over the amino site in alkaline solutions. It means that the coordination of
the second amide function is not simply a deprotonation reaction but it is accompanied
with the rearrangement of the metal binding sites of the peptides. Namely, the
terminal amino group and the subsequent amide are the primary ligating sites
below pH 9, but they are partly replaced by the imidazole and preceding amide functions
at high pH values. In agreement with this assumption the deprotonation of the
third amide function (pK(−2/−3) values) is
very much suppressed as compared to that of
ADAA (= 9.88).

 makes it clear that the metal binding of the histidyl residue is
facilitated in the presence of excess metal ions. The major dinuclear species
at 2 : 1 metal ion to ligand ratios is [Cu2H−3L] which
can be easily built up from the superposition of the N-terminal and histidyl
binding sites (see ). All three amide functions take part in metal
binding in this species and both copper(II) ions have one free coordination
site. As a consequence, the formation of mixed hydroxo complexes is possible by
increasing pH, but their formation is accompanied with very small spectral
changes.

The
metal ion speciation of the copper(II)-VIDAH system is shown in  at 1 : 1 and
2 : 1 metal ion to ligand ratios. The comparison of Figures   reveals a
high similarity in the complex formation processes of FDAH and VIDAH, but some
important differences can also be observed. The stoichiometry of the first
species formed below pH 5 is [CuHL] and taking into account the pH values it
can contain only the imidazole-N atom in protonated from. Its concentration is,
however, significantly higher than its counterpart formed in the copper(II)-FDAH system, suggesting that the contribution
of -carboxylate group to metal binding is enhanced
with the pentapeptide. The concentration of [CuL] is negligible and the species [CuH−1L]
predominates in the pH range from 5.5 to 7.5. The coordination mode of the [CuH−1L] species
of N-terminally free peptide complexes is generally described by the formation
of 2N complexes (NH2,N−), but the
spectroscopic data (see ) contradict with this assumption. Both
absorption and CD spectra support the metal binding of 3 nitrogen donor atoms,
that is, the existence of (NH2, N−, N−, -COO−)
coordination. The outstanding stability of this binding mode has already been
discussed in the introduction and the spectral parameters in  are also
in good agreement with literature data [, ]. As a consequence, the real stoichiometry
of [CuH−1L] is
[Cu(H−2L)H]
containing two deprotonated amide groups, while the imidazolium group remains
protonated. The corresponding pK(–1/–2) value is
higher than that of the free ligand, but similar decrease in the acidity of
non-coordinating side chains has already been reported in some other peptide
complexes containing coordinated amide functions [, ]. The small blue shift
of the absorption spectra (see ) partly contradicts with the assumption
that only the deprotonation of the side chain imidazolium group occurs in the
pH range 6.5 to 9.5, but the speciation curves in  clearly show that formation
of [CuH−2L]
significantly overlap with the formation of dinuclear species affecting the
overall spectra of the samples. At the first sight it is surprising that the
concentration of the dinuclear complex is more than 30% in equimolar samples,
but the application of the statistical treatment for the distribution of metal
ions among equivalent binding sites results in a ratio of 25% for dinuclear
species [].  demonstrates that the major dinuclear species [Cu2H−4L]
predominates in a very wide pH range (pH 7–10) and its exclusive formation is further
supported by the CD spectra depicted at .

The metal
binding sites of [Cu2H−4L] (see
) can be easily obtained from the superposition of the (NH2, N−, N−-COO−) and 
coordination modes starting from the N- and C-termini of the peptide,
respectively. This species has only one free coordination site which is
available for hydroxo complex formation in strongly alkaline samples.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Both
thermodynamic and spectroscopic data provide further evidence that side chain
donor atoms of aspartyl and histidyl residues have a significant influence on
the metal binding affinity of peptide molecules. In the case of terminally
protected peptides, like Ac-HHVGD-NH2 and Ac-HVGDH-NH2 the role of the imidazole-N donor functions are especially striking resulting
in the formation 3N and 4N coordinated copper(II) complexes. The -carboxylate functions of aspartic acid is much
less pronounced affecting only the stability constants of the Cu–-bonded
species. The presence of free terminal amino group, however, significantly
changes the complex formation processes. The amino and -carboxylate groups of FDAH and VIDAH create a very effective metal
binding site with the (NH2, N−, -COO−) and (NH2, N−, N−, -COO−)
coordination modes, respectively, while the histidine sites are available for
the formation of the (, N−, N−) binding
mode. As a consequence, dinuclear species are formed in high concentration with
these peptides, while the mononuclear species may have a series of coordination
isomers in solution.
