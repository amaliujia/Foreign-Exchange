ABSTRACT
His-Val-His and His-Val-Gly-Asp are two naturally occurring peptide sequences, present at the active site
of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD). We have already studied the interaction of His-Val-His=A
(copper binding site) with Cu(II) and of His-Val-Gly-Asp=B (zinc binding site) with Zn(II). As a
continuation of this work and for comparison purposes we have also studied the interaction of Zn(II) with
His-Val-His and Cu(II) with His-Val-Gly-Asp using both potentiometric and spectroscopic methods (visible,
EPR, NMR). The stoichiometry, stability constants and solution structure ofthe complexes formed have been
determined. Histamine type of coordination is observed for/ZnAH/z+,/ZnA/+,/ZnA2H/+ and/ZnA2/in acidic
pH while deprotonation of coordinated water molecules is observed at higher pH. /CUB/ species is
characterized by the formation of a macrochelate and histamine type coordination. Its stability results in the
suppression of amide deprotonation which occurs at high pH resulting in the formation ofthe highly distorted
from square planar geometry 4N complex/CuBH.3/3.
INTRODUCTION
Oxidative stress is implicated in numerous biological processes such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
rheumatoid arthritis, aging, carcinogenesis and inflammation /1,2/. Superoxide dismutases comprise an
integral part of the cellular protective mechanism against oxidative stress. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase

The active center of Cu,Zn-SOD, as shown by crystallographic data/4/, consists of one copper ion and
one zinc ion, bridged by the imidazolate ring of a histidine residue of the protein backbone. Copper is
coordinated to four histidine residues (Hist,, His46, His6, Hisses) and a water molecule in a distorted square
planar geometry whereas zinc is coordinated to three histidine (His6, His69, Hisvs) and one aspartate residue
(Ds) in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Copper is very important in maintaining superoxide dismutase
activity whereas the replacement of zinc with other metals like Cu+, Co2+, Hg+, Cd+, Ni+ or VOz+ does not
affect the enzymatic activity. The role of zinc in the function of SOD is not apparent and it is suggested that it
plays a structural role. On the other hand, the fact that point mutations at the zinc site account for
approximately 2% ofcases of amyotrophical lateral sclerosis is suggestive ofa modulating role for zinc/5/.
The design and the application of synthetic low molecular weight metal complexes as SOD mimics have
received considerable attention during the last decades. Effectiveness, permeability of cell membranes, low
cost and low toxicity are considered to be essential properties for an efficient SOD mimic. A great number of
mononuclear, homo- and heterodinuclear metal complexes with ligands such as Schiff bases/6/, macrocyclic
ligands /7/ and peptides /8/ have been proposed as SOD mimics.
Our focus has been the incorporation of peptides, part of the native sequence, in the design of a structural
analogue of the Cu,Zn-SOD. His44-Va145-His46 is part of the copper active center participating in coordination
through the imidazole groups of the two histidine residues. Hisvs-Val79-Glys0-Asps is present in the zinc
active site coordinating to the zinc ion through the imidazole group of the histidine residue and the
carboxylate group of the aspartate residue. In previous work/9/, we have characterized the species formed in
the systems His-Val-His-Cu(II) and His-Val-Gly-Asp-Zn(II). As a continuation of this work, we have also
studied the interaction of His-Val-His with Zn(II) and His-Val-Gly-Asp with Cu(II) and compared them with
the previous ones.

Peptide synthesis
The peptides His-Val-His and His-Val-Gly-Asp were synthesized as previously described/9/.
Methods
(i) The pH-metric titrations in the pH range 2.0-10 were performed in 5 cm samples in the concentration
range of 2-4x10.3
mol dm-3
at ligand to metal ion ratios 1:1 and 2:1. The number of experimental points was
100-120 (cm3-pH) for each titration curve. In the case of the system His-Val-His-Zn2+
1:1, experimental data
points for pH>6.0 had to be rejected because ofprecipitation ofmetal hydroxide. Argon was bubbled through
the samples to ensure the absence of oxygen and carbon dioxide and for stirring the solutions. All pH-metric
measurements were carried out at 298 K, at a constant ionic strength of 0.2 mol dm3
KC1. The
potentiometric titrations were carried out using a Radiometer PHM 84 pH-meter, equipped with a 6.02.'-t4.100
combined electrode (Metrohm) and a Dosimat 715 burette (Metrohm). The pH-readings were converted to
hydrogen ion concentration as described elsewhere/10/and the value pKw=13.75 was used for the ionization
of water. The evaluation of the measurements and calculations of the stability and ionization constants were
performed, using the pHENG/11/, PSEQUAD /12/ and SUPERQUAD /12/ computer programs.
(ii) The pH values of the samples for spectroscopic studies were measured with a Grison GLP21
pHmeter, equipped with a glass electrode [IAg/AgCI, U402-M6-57/100 of Mettler, Toledo.
(iii) The visible spectra were recorded on a Jasco 530 spectrophotometer, in the same concentration range
as used for potentiometry.
(iv) The EPR continuous wave spectra were recorded at liquid He temperature in a EP-200D Bruker
instrument at the X-band, equipped with a cryostat ofOxford Instruments.
(v) The H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 400 MHz spectrometer at 300 K. Deuterium
oxide was used as a solvent. Concentration and ionic strength were of the same range as used tbr the
potentiometric measurements.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Characterization of the system His-Val-His (A)-Zn(II).
Acid dissociation constants of His-Val-His have been previously determined/9/. Formation constants for
the zinc(II)-His-Val-His complexes were evaluated from titration data in the pH range 4-12. The stability
constants for the species formed are given in Table 1. For comparison purposes the formation constants for
Cu(II) complexes with His-Val-His /9/ are also shown. Cu(II) complexes with His-Val-His are
thermodynamically more stable than the Zn(II) complex as expected, according to the Irving-Williams series.
Ligand excess is required to keep zinc in solution in alkaline media as zinc hydroxide precipitates at
pH>6 in the 1"1 system. For the system of His-Val-His-Zn(II) 2"1 it is found that His-Val-His forms
numerous complexes with zinc(II) ion, all of them present over a wide pH range, making it hard to evaluate
each species separately. Species distribution for the system His-Vai-His-Zn(II) 2:1 is shown in Figure 1.

The presence of histidine in the N-terminal position favors histamine type coordination forming a {NH,
N,,,} chelate 13]. Coordination of the terminal amino group and the N-terminal imidazole is possible for the
ZnAH species, with the C-terminal imidazole remaining protonated. The pK value for the deprotonation and
coordination of the C-terminal imidazole (pK=5.71) for His-VaI-His is close to the one observed for His-Pro-
Itis (pK=6.12) [14]. Furthermore, the ZnA species exhibits a slightly increased stability (IogD0=5.43)
compared to the simple model of histamine (Iogo=5.15) [15] suggesting the formation of a macrochelate
via the coordination ofthe C-termir-tl imidazole.
The formation constant for the species ZnA2 (Iogl)z0=9.85) corresponds well to the one observed for
histamine (Iog12o=9.97) [15] suggesting histamine type of coordination for both peptide molecules. The pK
value for the ionization of ZnA2H to ZnAz (pK=6.80) approximates the pK value of the C-terminal imidazole
ol" the ti'ee peptide (pK=6.73) suggesting that the C-terminal imidazole of the one peptide molecule in the
ZnA21! species remains protonated.

Upon titration of the system HVH-Zn 2:1, two additional equivalents of protons were titrated per metal
ion. This is in agreement with what was observed before for the titration of similar systems /9,16/: The
possibilities for the groups from which the additional equivalents of protons are titrated include coordinated
water molecules and the peptide imino groups. The pK value (ZnA2 ZnAzH. + H+
pK=l 1.33) is of the
same magnitude as for the titration of a proton from a coordinated water molecule in the Zn(II) complexes of
nitrilotriacetic acid and 13, 13', 13"-triaminotriethylamine (10.0 and 11.1, respectively) /17/. Further
deprotonation of the ZnA2H.1 complex may lead to the displacement of one of the two ligands by a second
hydroxide ion, resulting in complex ZnAH./.
To elucidate further the nature of complexes of Zn(II) with His-Val-His, 1H NMR spectra of His-Val-His
and His-Val-His-Zn(II) 2:1 in DzO were m'easured. Figure 2 shows the imidazole region for the system His-
Val-His-Zn(II) 2:1 as a function of pD. Comparison of the chemical shills for the free peptide and in the
presence ofZn(II) at selected pD values is further illustrated in Figure 3.
From Figure 2, it can be concluded that the complexation of His-Val-His by Zn(II) is pD-dependent. In
acidic pD, the resonances for the imidazole protons are shifted downfield upon complexation of the peptide

with Zn(ll). A second set of resonances is detectable at pD=5.4 which increases as pD increases. At pD=6.7
the two sets of resonances (1 and 2) are well-resolved confirming the presence of two different species. This
is further supported by the two dimensional spectrum H-IH TOCSY (Figure 4) in which each set of
104
,4lexanch'a Al),ari et al. Bioinorganic Chem.istty andApplications
resonances ofthe C2-H imidazole protons corresponds to a set ofresonances ofC5-H imidazole protons.
The first species (I) appears to be kinetically stable on the NMR time scale whereas the second one (2)
exhibits relative broad resonances possibly due to fast exchange of the peptide between the free and
complexed form. The presence of two species exhibiting different kinetic behavior had been observed
previously for complexes of Zn(II) with the peptides Gly-His, Gly-Ala [18], Gly-His-Gly and Gly-His-Lys
19]. In these studies, the binding of Zn(ll) in the kinetically stable complex was found to occur via the N-
terminal amino nitrogen, the deprotonated amide nitrogen, and the imidazole I-nitrogen. The differences in
the chemical shifts of Table 2 demonstrate that this is not the case for the Zn(ll)-His-VaI-His system. There is
a difference in the chemical shifts of C2-H protons upon complexation of the imidazole and His 0t-CH
protons upon binding of the terminal amino group at pD=6.5. In the case of Zn-Gly-His and Zn-Ala-His
systems, the shift of 0.156 ppm and 0.212 ppm to lower frequency respectively for the 0t-CH protons was not
observed for the system Zn-His-Val-His.
The species distribution of the Zn-His-Val-Gly-Asp 1:2 system can give us an insight in the interpretation
of the NMR data. In ZnA and ZnAH, present in solution at pD-6.5 (Figure 1), at least two nitrogen atoms
coordinate to zinc ion, whereas in the species ZnA2H and ZnA2, also present at pD=6.5, the mode of
coordination is {4N}. This suggests the presence of two different types of species with different coordination
modes at this pH. Comparison of the integral of the peaks for complex 1 (46%) and 2 (54%) wlth the
fractions of MA, MAH (48%) and MA2, MAEH (51%) calculated by potentiometric data shows an agreement
within 5% deviation.

As is illustrated in Figure 2, resonances of the imidazole protons are pD independent above pD=8.1
whereas the chemical shifts for imidazole and His t-CH protons (Table 2) approximate the chemical shifts of
the uncomplexed peptide. This is due to the presence ofhydroxide ions partially displacing the peptide donor
atoms/17/. The proposed structures for the species formed are shown in Figure 5.

B. Characterization of the system His-Val-Gly-Asp(B)-Cu(ll).
Acid dissociation constants have been determined previously [9]. The species formed were characterized
by potentiometric titrations in the pH range 3-1 I, EPR spectroscopy and visible spectra. The formation
constants of the complexes are shown in Table 3. Stability constants for Zn(li) complexes [9] are also shown
tbr comparison purposes.
The species distribution for the systems l" and 2:1 are shown in Figure 6. The presence of histidine at
lhe N-terminus results in histamine type coordination also for this peptide [13]. CuBH is a dominating
species at pH~3.5 (Figure 6) probably having the C-terminal carboxylate, the aspartyl sidechain carboxylate
and the N-terminal histidine imidazole deprotonated. The N-terminal amino group remains protonated at this
low ptl range excluding the possibility of histamine type of coordination. This is further supported by visible
spectroscopy since CuBH exhibits a X,,,,,=744 nm (Table 4) which is much higher compared to the Cu(ll)-
histamine system (X,.,.=681 nm) [20] suggesting that coordination in CuBH takes place via one nitrogen
donor atom, probably fi'om the N-terminal imidazole. However, an equilibrium between species with
different coordination modes, comprising the species with (i) {NH2, CO} coordination at the N-termini with
protonated imidazole, (ii) monodentate imidazole coordination with protonated amino group and (iii)
histamine-like coordination with protonated beta-carboxylic group, cannot be excluded.

Fig. 6: Species distribution for the system His-Val-Gly-Asp(B)-Cu(II) 1"1 (A) and 2:1 (B).
In the 1"1 system, a species of 1"1 stoichiometry is present over a wide pH range, 3-9. This species was
found to be EPR silent. Potentiometry cannot distinguish whether monomeric or dimeric species is formed
since the introduction of the dimeric species into the model did not result in any change of the log 13 values
for the other species formed. The formation of dimeric species of Cu(II) with peptides having histidine at the
N-termini like His-His/24/, His-Gly and His-Gly-Gly/20, 22, 23/has been observed previously. In these
dimeric species, the amino group, the deprotonated amide and the carboxylate (His-Gly, His-Gly-Gly) or
imidazole (His-His) participate in coordination, whereas the imidazole acts as the bridging group. This mode
of coordination is not supported by the present spectroscopic data. The Xm,x=672 nm found for the system of
His-Val-Gly-Asp approximates the corresponding value found for the system Cu(II)-His-Gly (,x=677 nm)
/20/, suggesting a histamine type coordination for the 1:1 stoichiometry species. Furthermore, the higher ratio
of the stepwise stability contants (logKcuB/KcuB2=4.4) compared to the simple system of histamine
(logKcuB/Kcu2=2.98) /15/ suggests extra stabilization ofthe complex probably coming from the aspartyl side

chain carboxylate. This evidence does not support formation of a dimer because in this case the carboxylate
acts as a bridging ligand and a 7-membered chelate is formed, not stable enough to provide the extra
stabilization required for the dimeric species. Furthermore, potentiometric and spectroscopic studies of the
interaction between Cu(ll) and peptides having aspartic acid residues have not detected the presence of such
dimeric species [24]. The distortion in the geometry of a macrochelate could account for the poor resolution
ofthe EPR spectrum.
The stability of CuB species excludes the formation of the bis complex in the I:1 system but it cannot be
prevented in the case of the 2:1 system in which it is a prevailing species at the pH range 6-9.5. The
formation constant for the CuBz species (Iogl320=15.08) is in good agreement with the one found for Cu(ll)-
His-Gly system (!og120=15.06) [23], for which histamine type of coordination for both peptide molecules has
been proposed. On the other hand, the d-d transition for this species centered at 638 nm seems relatively high
for a 2NHz, 2Ni,,, coordination. The EPR parameters determined for this species (gll =2.29, Ail=180) however
are in good agreement with similar species formed by ligands containing histamine-like donor sets [15].
in the 2:i system, CuBt-t is also present at the pH range 4-8. Histamine-type.of coordination is made
possible for the one peptide molecule whereas the other one acts as a monodentate ligand, probably via the
imidazole nitrogen atom.
Amide deprotonation is suppressed by the formation of the macrochelate and the bis complexes in the 1:1
and 2:1 system respectively, shifted to higher pH values, having pK=7.85 for the first amide ionization
compared to pK'=5.56 for the simple system of tetraglycine [25]. A blue shift is noticeable in the visible
spectra as the pH increases (Table 4) suggesting the successive deprotonation and coordination of the amide
nitrogens. The ,,.=608 nm observed for CuBH. is similar to that found for His-Gly and His-Gly-Gly
(,,,,=613 rim) [22]. This absorption maximum is attributed to the coordination of three nitrogen atoms: the
deprotonated amide nitrogen, the terminal amino group and the imidazole. The coordination of the aspartyl
side chain carboxylate by formation of a macrochelate cannot be excluded. This evidence is further supported
by the EPR parameters (gll =2.22, AII=I90 which correspond well to a 3N species [25]. However, the three
108
Alexamh'a M?.,ari et ai. Bioinorganic Chemistry andApplications
nitrogen donors cannot coordinate equatorially to Cu(II) due to steric hindrance which probably results in the
axial coordination ofone nitrogen.
The deprotonation and coordination of the second amide nitrogen results in the formation of CuBH.2.
Spectroscopic data for CuBH.2 (max=556 nm) agrees well with the same species formed by triglycine
(max=553 nm) having {NH_, N', N', COO} coordination mode/25/. CuBH.I in the system of His-Val-Gly-
Asp (1ogl311. =-7.21) exhibits extra stabilization compared to the system of tetraglycine (logl311.2 -7.41) in
which the terminal carboxylate does not participate in the coordination of Cu(ll) whereas in the system of
triglycine, CuBH. (log131.z=-7.02) appears to be more stable due to the coordination of the C-terminal
carboxylate which is in closer proximity compared to His-Val-Gly-Asp/25/.
The d-d transition for CuBH.3 (9mx='524 nm, =150 lmolcm"I
is typical for a 4N species formed via
the coordination of three amide nitrogens and the amino group, in good agreement with the corresponding
species of Ala-Ala-Ala-Asp (ax=520 nm, e=140 lmolcm")/24/. The EPR parameters (g11=2.17, AII=175)
correspond to 4N coordination mode as found already for other similar systems like Ala-Ala-Ala-Asp
(g11=2.18, AI1=205)/24/and tetraglycine (g11=2.172, AI1=213)/25/for {3N, NH} mode of coordination. The
relatively low hyperfine constant compared to what it is found for the square planar 4N donor complexes of
Cu(ll) with cyclam (gll=2.187, AI1=205) and dioxycyelam (g11=2.171, All=215)/25/, reveals a great distortion
from the square planar geometry for the CuBH.3 complex. On the other hand, the axial interaction of the
imidazole may account for this unusually low All value.
The proposed structures for the complexes formed in the Cu(ll)-His-Val-Gly-Asp system are shown in
Figure 7.
From the study of the interaction of Cu(ll) with the peptide sequences His-Val-His /9/ and His-Val-Gly-
Asp, present in the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD, it can be concluded that Cu(ll) forms stable complexes with
both peptides. In CuL species (L=His-VaI-His or His-Val-Gly-Asp), the functional groups present in the
native enzyme participate also in the coordination of Cu(ll) in solution by both peptides. The comparison of
the stability of these two species reveals a higher stability of almost one order of magnitude for His-Val-His
(1og[3=10.53) compared to His-Val-Gly-Asp (iogl3=9.74), probably responsible for keeping Cu(ll) in its
naturally occurring position. The 4-5 orders of magnitude greater stability of Cu(ll) complexes wittr both
peptides compared to Zn(ll) (Tables and 3) explains well why Cu(ll) can replace successfully Zn(ll) in the
Cu,Zn-SOD enzyme.
On the other hand, ZnL species is approximately 0.5 units more stable for His-VaI-His compared to His-
Val-Gly-Asp (Tables and 3) probably due to the higher stabilizing effect of the C-terminal imidazole. It is
apparent that there is no higher preference for the presence of Zn(ll) at the zinc site. This further supports a
modulating role of Cu(II) in the activity of the superoxide dismutase enzyme whereas Zn(ll) is restricted to a
structural role.

CONCLUSION
We have studied the interaction of Cu(ll) with the tetrapeptide His-Val-Gly-Asp and of Zn(ll) with the
tripeptide His-Val-His. The two peptides sun'ound Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions in the active site of Cu,Zn-SOD.
The equilibrium of species in solution was established by potentiometric titrations while the structures of

these species were characterized by UV-vis, EPR and H NMR scpectroscopic measurements. The major
binding sites involve the {NH2, Nim} of the N-terminal histidine for both His-Val-His and His-Val-Gly-Asp.
This binding mode was identified in ZnAH, ZnA, ZnA2H, ZnA2 and CuB, CuB2 and CuBH.. At low pH the
formation of a kinetically stable and a kinetically labile Zn(ll) complexes was demonstrated by NMR
whereas at high pH deprotonation of water molecules coordinated to Zn(II) occurs. The stabilizing effect of
the aspartyl side chain of His-Val-Gly-Asp results in the formation ofa macrochelate in the species CuB. The
deprotonation and coordination of amide nitrogens cannot be prevented and occurs at high pH leading to the
formation of complexes with great distortion of square planar geometry. Our next step concerns the
evaluation ofthe importance in SOD activity ofthese different coordination modes observed.
