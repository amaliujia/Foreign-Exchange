1. INTRODUCTION
During the last two decades, we have
been pursuing studies [, ] towards the development of routes
and strategies for the synthesis of high-nuclearity complexes of
3d metals in moderate oxidation states, since such clusters may
display unusual structures and interesting magnetic properties.
One of our routes [] that we have been exploiting takes
advantage of the observation that the reactions between metal
carboxylates and di-2-pyridyl ketone (pyCOpy, ) lead  to
incomplete replacement of the carboxylate ligands by anionic forms
of the ligand and the formation of large polynuclear arrays of
metal ions. The structural diversity of the resultant species
stems from the ability of the singly and doubly deprotonated
anions of the gem-diol form of pyCOpy to adopt a variety
of coordination modes, and sometimes two different modes occur in
the same complex. This strategy has resulted in the formation of
several polynuclear metal complexes with nuclearities ranging from
3 to 26 exhibiting aesthetical appealing structures and
interesting magnetic properties [].

In a next step, our efforts turned towards the use of
2,2′-pyridil (pyCOCOpy, ), which presents a
chemical similarity with pyCOpy but contains an extra donor group,
in order to see how incorporation of this ligand type might affect
the structures and physical properties of the products [].
The reaction “blend” of pyCOCOpy and carboxylate ligands in
alcohols produced a series of planar pentanuclear copper(II)
complexes with the general formula
[Cu5(OH)2{pyCO(OR)CO(OR)py}2(O2CMe)4(ROH)2]
(R =  Et, n-Pr), where the ligand pyCO(OR)CO(OR)py2− (see
) is a product of the metal-assisted
nucleophilic addition of ethanol to the carbonyl groups of
pyCOCOpy.

Herein we report our efforts to expand the almost unexplored
coordination chemistry of 2,2′-pyridil [] by incorporating
the less basic halides (Cl−, Br−), instead of
carboxylates, in the reaction scheme. In the presence of these
halides, pyCOCOpy undergoes a metal-promoted alcoholysis and
oxidation to yield the pyCOOEt ligand (see
). In the case of the bromide, an autoredox
process results in the reduction of copper(II) to copper(I)
yielding a mixed-valence CuI/CuII complex, while in
the case of the chloride a mononuclear copper(II) complex is
obtained.

Autoredox processes—not uncommon in copper halide
chemistry—cause reduction of copper(II) to copper(I) often
leading to mixed-valence systems []. The increased redox activity
of the copper(II) bromide system relative to the copper(II)
chloride system has been documented []. It has been
suggested that this process involves the decomposition of
CuBr2 to CuBr and Br2 []. Mixed valency
is well established in biology []. Biological systems have
given scientists an opportunity to explore the ways in which mixed
valency is used to store and transfer energy, convert light to
chemical reactivity in photosynthesis, and in general utilize
mixed valency in redox reactions.

2. EXPERIMENTS
All manipulations were performed under aerobic conditions using
materials and solvents as received. IR spectra were recorded on a
Perkin-Elmer PC16 FT-IR spectrometer with samples prepared as KBr
pellets. Far-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS 113v FT
spectrometer with samples prepared as polyethylene pellets. C, H,
and N elemental analyses were
performed with a Carlo Erba EA 108 analyzer:

A warm solution (50°C) of 2,2′-pyridil (0.10 g,
0.47 mmol) in EtOH (10 cm3) was added to a warm
solution (50°C) of CuCl2 · 2H2O
(0.08 g, 0.47 mmol) in EtOH (10 cm3). The
resulting green solution was cooled to room temperature and
layered with a mixture of Et2O/n-hexane (1 : 1 v/v,
40 cm3). Well-formed, X-ray quality green-blue crystals
of 1 appeared within a period of ten days. The crystals
were collected by vacuum filtration, washed with EtOH (2 ×
2 cm3) and Et2O (2 × 5 cm3),
and dried in air. The yield was ca. 50% (based on copper). Found

2.1. X-ray crystallography
Both data sets were collected at 298 K using a P21
Nicolet diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation
(λ = 1.54180 Å). Data for 2 were corrected
for Lorentz, polarization, and absorption effects. Symmetry
equivalent data of 1 and 2 were averaged with
Rint = 0.0124 and 0.0261, respectively,   to give 1902
and 1916 independent reflections from a total 2055 and 2050
collected. Both structures were solved by direct methods and were
refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2, using 1902
 and 1916  reflections, and refining 143
and 159 parameters, respectively. All nonhydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically, except Ow1 and Ow2 for 1 which
were refined isotropically. All hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon
atoms were located by difference maps and their positions were
refined isotropically. There were no significant residual peaks in
either electron density map. Details of the data collection and
refinement are given in .

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Synthesis
Reactions of pyCOCOpy with CuCl2 · 2H2O or
CuBr2 in EtOH resulted in the mononuclear Cull
complex 1 and a mixed-valence Cul/Cull
coordination polymer 2, respectively. The ligand found in
these two complexes, pyCOOEt, is a product of alcoholysis
(nucleophilic addition of EtOH to the carbonyl group) and
oxidation of the pyCOCOpy ligand, followed by its decomposition.
In this metal-assisted reaction it might not be necessary for the
carbonyl atom(s) to be coordinated to the metal centre. The
induced polarization from the pyridyl nitrogen atoms' coordination
might be sufficient [].

Cull/pyCOCOpy reaction systems were
synthetically investigated in the past. A similar reaction of
pyCOCOpy with CuCl2 · 2H2O  or
Cu(ClO4)2 · 6H2O in MeOH has resulted in
trans-[Cu(pic)2] · 2H2O
(pic− = picolinate, ) [, ].
The picolinate ligand found in this complex is the product of the
metal ion-promoted nucleophilic addition of OH− (from
H2O in the solvent) to the carbonyl group and oxidation
of pyCOCOpy. trans-[Cu(pic)2] has also been
isolated as a byproduct from the reaction of
[Cu2(O2CMe)4(H2O)2] or
Cu(O2CPh)2 · EtOH with pyCOCOpy in n-PrOH or EtOH
at room temperature, respectively []; these reactions gave
the unusual pentanuclear complexes mentioned in the introduction.
It has also been reported that trans-[Cu(pic)2]
and/or trans-[Cu(pic)2] · 2H2O are
the major products from the reaction of
[Cu2(O2CMe)4(H2O)2] or
Cu(O2CPh)2 · EtOH with pyCOCOpy in MeOH under
reflux []. Thus, the Cull-promoted
transformation of pyCOCOpy to pyCOOEt, observed in
1 and 2, is novel.

The coordination chemistry of pyCOCOpy with other
metal ions has also been investigated. It appears that
the reaction conditions as well as the nature of the
metal ion are crucial in such reactions. The reactions
of M(ClO4)2 · 6H2O (M =
Coll or NiII) with pyCOCOpy in MeOH under reflux resulted in complexes
[Colll{pyC(OH)(COO)py}2] -(ClO4) · MeOH and
[Ni{pyC(OH)(COO)py}2] · 2H2O, respectively
[]; pyC(OH)(COO)py− is the anion of pyridilic
acid (see ), which is a product of the
nucleophilic addition of OH− to one O-bonded carbonyl
group of pyCOCOpy, followed by a benzilic acid-type rearrangement.
The reaction pathway for the classical base-induced benzilic
acid-type rearrangement is represented in 
[, ]. The crucial step in the overall process is the
migration of the group X from the carbon atom attacked by
OH− to the adjacent carbon atom, whereby the carbon
center initially under attack becomes a carboxylate. It has been
demonstrated that the benzilic acid rearrangement can be promoted
by 3d-metal ions [, ]. Recently [] Abrahams et al. studied the Call/pyCOCOpy reaction system in basic
alcoholic solutions. Solutions containing
Ca(NO3)2 · 4H2O, pyCOCOpy and Et3N in
either MeOH or EtOH in a sealed tube at ∼90°C
gave the cubane complexes
[Ca4{pyC(COOR)(O)py}4(NO3)4], where R = Me or
Et. The reaction proceeds by a similar benzilic acid rearrangement
where esterification of the carboxylic acid has occurred to give
the coordinated anion pyC(COOR)(O)py− (see
).

When pyCOCOpy was treated with CuBr2, an autoredox
process took place that led to the partial reduction of copper(II)
to copper(I) and the isolation of the mixed-valence
Cul/Cull polymeric complex 2. This reduction
does not take place when CuCl2 · 2H2O is used
instead of CuBr2. This experimental observation is in
accordance with literature data which indicate that the redox
activity of the copper(II) bromide system is increased relative to
the copper(II) chloride system [–].

3.2. IR spectra
The IR spectra of the two complexes are similar but
not identical. The ν(C=O) and the ν(C−O) vibrational modes in the spectra of the free
ligand (pyCOOEt) occur at 1729 and 1254 cm−1 [],
respectively; these bands shift to lower [1708 cm−1 (1), 1662 cm−1 (2)] and higher
[1262 cm−1 (1), 1264 cm−1 (2)]
wavenumbers, respectively, in the spectra of the two complexes as
a result of the coordination of the carbonyl-type ester oxygen.
The significantly lower wavenumber of ν(C=O) in the
spectrum of 2, as compared to the ν(C=O)
in the spectrum of 1, is due to the weak interaction of
the carbonyl oxygen of the pyCOOEt ligand with one Cul
ion in the crystal structure of 2 (vide infra); this
interaction gives a pseudobridging character in the carbonyl-type
ester oxygen. The  and 
modes of the pyridyl ring occur at 1592, 1573, 1465 and
1432 cm−1 in the spectrum of the free ligand [];
these modes shift to higher wavenumbers in the spectrum of the two
complexes confirming that the pyridyl nitrogen acts as a donor.

The strong band at 271 cm−1 in the far-IR spectrum of
1 is assigned to the ν(Cu−Cl)t
mode []; this band is absent in the spectrum of 2,
as expected. The 201, 190, and 175 cm−1 bands in the
spectrum of 2 are associated with the bridging
Cull−Br and Cul−Br stretches
[].

3.3. Description of structures
The molecular structure of 1 is shown in
, and selected bond lengths and angles are
listed in . The structure consists of a neutral
[Cu(pyCOOEt)2Cl2] molecule and one water molecule
which is split over four positions with 25% occupancy. The
Cull atom is situated on a crystallographic centre of
inversion and has an axially elongated distorted octahedral
environment with two pyridyl nitrogen atoms and two Cl−
on the equatorial plane, and the two carbonyl-type oxygen atoms at
the axial positions [Cu−O(1) 2.438(4) Å]. Two
pyCOOEt ligands chelate to the metal centre through the pyridyl
nitrogen atom and the carbonyl-type oxygen atom. The distortion of
the axially elongated octahedron is due to the small bite angle
N(1)−Cu−O(1) of the O,N-chelating ligand which
is 75.1(1)°.

The molecular structure of 2 is shown in
, and selected bond lengths and angles appear
in . The structure consists of
[Cul2Cull(pyCOOEt)2Br4]n chains that run
parallel to the b axis. Each chain is composed of alternating
Cull(pyCOOEt)2Br2 and Cul2Br2
subunits. The Cull atom [Cu(2)] is situated on a
crystallographic centre of inversion and has an axially elongated
distorted octahedral environment with two pyridyl nitrogen atoms
and two carbonyl-type ester oxygen atoms on the equatorial plane,
and two Br− atoms at the axial positions
[Cu(2)−Br(1) 2.664(1) Å]. Contrary to 1,
the distortion of the axial elongated octahedron around the
Cull atom is less pronounced due to the larger bite
angle N(1)−Cu(2)−O(1) of the O,N-chelating
ligand which is 79.9(2)°. The two pyCOOEt ligands chelate
to the metal centre through the pyridyl nitrogen atom and the
carbonyl-type oxygen atom.

The Cul2Br2 subunit forms a four-membered ring
that lies around a crystallographic centre of
inversion. The Cul ⋯ Cul [Cu(1) ⋯ Cu(1)b]
distance is 2.669 Å and the
Cul−Br−Cul
[Cu(1)−Br(2)−Cu(1)b] angle is 67.1(1)°
(b: 1-x, 2-y, -z). Each
Cull(pyCOOEt)2Br2 moiety bridges two
Cul2Br2 subunits through its axial Br−
ligands. The Cull ⋯ Cul
[Cu(2) ⋯ Cu(1)] distance is 3.618 Å and
the Cull−Br−Cul
[Cu(2)−Br(1)−Cu(1)] angle is 92.5(1)°.
Therefore, each Cul is surrounded by three Br−
atoms in a distorted trigonal planar arrangement. The
three Br−Cul−Br angles are
112.9(1)°  [Br(2)−Cu(1)−Br(2)b],  117.1(1)°
[Br(1)−Cu(1)−Br(2)b],  and  129.9(1)°
[Br(1)−Cu(1)−Br(2)], while the three
Cul−Br distances are 2.337(1) Å
[Cu(1)−Br(1)], 2.387(1) Å [Cu(1)−Br(2)],
and 2.443(1) Å [Cu(1)−Br(2)b]. In addition to the
three Br− atoms, there is a weak contact between the
carbonyl-type oxygen atom of the pyCOOEt ligand and the
Cul atom. The carbonyl atom is situated above the
CulBr3 plane and the almost perpendicular to the
trigonal plane Cul ⋯ O distance is 2.898 Å.

The Cul and Cull sites have distinctly
different geometries which are typical for their oxidation states.
Therefore, 2 can be described as a class I complex
according to the Robin-Day classification scheme for the
mixed-valence compounds []. This scheme divides
mixed-valence compounds into three broad classes. In class I the
metals of different valence have distinctly different geometries
which are typical for each oxidation state. Class III
mixed-valence species are strongly delocalized systems in which
the symmetry and ligand environment of the two metal sites are
identical; it is possible to further divide class III into III-A
and III-B, depending whether or not discrete polynuclear groupings
of indistinguishable metal ions can be distinguished in the
crystal. Class II compounds represent an intermediate
classification in which delocalization does take place, but the
two types of site remain distinguishable.

Complexes 1 and 2 are the second and third,
respectively, structurally characterized metal complexes of
pyCOOEt. The first one was the 1D polymer
[HgCl2(pyCOOEt)]n containing six-coordinate
Hgll atoms, (N,Ocarbonyl)-chelating pyCOOEt
molecules and exclusively μ-Cl− ligands [].

4. CONCLUSIONS
The reactions of pyCOCOpy with CuCl2 · 2HO and
CuBr2 in warm EtOH resulted in a mononuclear copper(II)
complex and a mixed-valence polymeric complex, respectively. The
2,2′-pyridil molecule underwent a metal ion-assisted
nucleophilic addition of EtOH and oxidation to produce pyCOOEt,
which was incorporated as a ligand in both complexes. Although
both reactions took place under the same conditions (same solvent,
concentration, temperature, ligand), only in the case of
copper(II) bromide we managed to isolate a mixed-valence complex.
The isolation of a mixed-valence complex when copper(II) bromide
was the starting material confirms the increased redox activity of
copper(II) bromide relative to copper(II) chloride. The results
presented here support our belief that the Br−/pyCOCOpy
ligand “blends” may be effective generators of interesting
structural types in the chemistry of other redox-active transition
metals.
