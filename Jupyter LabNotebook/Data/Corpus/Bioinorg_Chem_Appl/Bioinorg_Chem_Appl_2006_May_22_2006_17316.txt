INTRODUCTION
Today, rapidly expanding population and limited sources are thought to be the most pressing global problems. This rapid increase in
the world population has multiplied the benefits of economical and
technological advancements. Fertility control is very essential for
maintaining satisfactory standards in the developing countries.
There is an increasing international recognition for the need to
control human fecundity. Needless to say there is an immediate
need for an inexpensive, safe, and effective as well as universally
acceptable contraceptive. For evolution of such an ideal method
for control of human fertility, it is necessary that the
reproductive process both of male and female need to be more
intensively investigated.

The population of India is multiplying at an alarming rate and has
almost crossed one billion by this time. Fertility regulation has
therefore become the major concern for the people of all the walks
of life. The dramatic success of oral contraceptives in women and
the lack of pill for man have stimulated research in male
fertility control. The development of new and improved
contraception agent for men has lagged behind the development of
female contraceptives.

The male, an integral part of the family unit, has largely been
sidelined by family planners. Currently, efforts are being made to
develop a male contraceptive agent, which would inhibit fertility
without affecting sex accessory function and libido. In this
endeavor, a variety of synthetic compounds have been evaluated in
males of laboratory species of mammals [–]. The
results obtained are also encouraging. Therefore, this approach
may form the basis for clinical regulation of male fertility in
future. Inorganic compounds have also been investigated and
applied for antifertility activity only and have not been screened
for toxicological effect [–]. In this context, the
present communication deals with the synthesis, characterization,
and contraceptive efficacy of iron(II) tetraazamacrocyclic
complexes. The complexes screened were investigated for their
antifertility efficacy at biochemical and histopathological levels.

The tetraazamacrocyclic complexes of iron(II) reported in this
paper have been synthesized for the first time. The complexes have
been isolated in pure form through crystallization. These show
good antifertility activity and may be useful for medicinal
purpose. Further, it has been reported that manganese salts
(chloride, nitrate, and acetate) cause loss of testicular germ
cells in rats and rabbits, and decreased libido and impotency were
noted in men occupationally exposed to manganese [].
Similarly, macrocyclic complexes of manganese(II)
and iron(II) exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial,
antiinflammatory, analgesic, and antifertility activity [].
The above discussion has inspired us to synthesize
tetraazamacrocyclic complexes of iron(II) and then screen them for
their antifertility activity.

EXPERIMENTS
Synthesis
Materials and methods
The chemicals including succinic acid, phthalic acid
(Fluka chemie AG, Industriestrasse, CH 9471, Buchs, Switzerland), 1,2-diaminoethane, 1,3-diaminopropane
(Merck Limited India,  Shiv Sagar Estate A, Dr, Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai  400018),
and Fe(CH3COO)2 (BDH) were used.

Synthesis of 2,5,10,13-tetraoxo-1,6,9,14-tetraazacyclohexa decane iron(II): [Fe(TAML1)(OAc)2]
The reaction was carried out in 1 : 2 : 2 molar
ratios. Fe–(CH3COO)2 (5 mmol) was dissolved in
methanol (25 mL) and cooled in an ice bath. To this solution,
taken in a 100 mL round bottom flask, was added
1,2-diaminoethane [corresponding to
Fe(CH3COO)2] in methanol (25 mL). The resulting
mixture was stirred for 25–30 h. The solid product was
isolated by filtration, repeatedly
washed with the same solvent, and dried in vacuo. The
compound was recrystallized in benzene and again dried in
vacuo.

Synthesis of
3,4,12,13-dibenzo-2,5,11,14-tetraoxo-1,6,10,15-tetraazacyclooctadecane
iron(II): [Fe(TAML2)(OAc)2]
The same experimental
procedure as for [Fe(TAML1)(OAc)2] was used. The
reagents used for this purpose are 1,3-diaminopropane and phthalic
acid.

Analytical methods and physical measurements
Nitrogen was estimated by Kjeldahl's method. Iron was estimated
gravimetrically. Carbon and hydrogen analyses were performed at Regional
Sophisticated Instrumentation Centre of Central Research Drugs Institute,
Lucknow. Conductivity measurements were made with a Systronic (Model 305) conductivity bridge in dry dimethylformamide. Molecular weights were
determined by the Rast Camphor method. The IR spectra of the solid samples were recorded as KBr discs on a Nicolet Magna FTIR-550 spectrophotometer.
Electronic spectra were recorded, in the range 200–600 nm, using methanol as
the solvent on a UV-160A Shimadzu spectrophotometer.

Antifertility activity
In the present investigations, healthy adult male albino rats
(Rattus norvegicus) each having weight between 200–250 g of
proven fertility were used. These were preferred over other
laboratory mammals because of their medium size, relatively double
nature, easy in handling and maintenance, size, relatively tocile
nature, covertly observable sex and libido, and in having a
relatively short gestation period of 23–30 days. Animals were
regularly checked for any disease and if found infected were
isolated and treated. Animals were fed on a diet of rat feed
pellets obtained from Hindustan Lever Ltd, Mumbai, India, and soaked
gram. Water was provided ad libitum.

In these investigations, doses of the compounds mixed in vehicle
(olive oil) were given orally with the help of hypodermic syringe
having pearl point needle, for 60 days and withdrawal (recovery)
for 30 days ().

The LD50 is a statistically derived single dose of a substance that can
be expected to cause death in 50% of the animals. In a prohibited
analysis method of LD50, the selected dose levels should bracket the
expected LD50 value with at least one dose level higher than the
expected LD50 but not causing 100% mortality and one dose level
below the expected LD50 but not causing 0% mortality. Toxicity of
the complexes was determined by calculating the LD50 values. Symptoms
of poisoning and mortality were observed and results of toxicity were
analyzed for determination of LD50 values of the complexes. On the
basis of LD50, values the present (only single) dose of the compounds
were decided for the experiment.

Fertility test
After the completion of the treatment, the fertility test was done.
On day 61, the animals were autopsied and blood was extracted from
heart. The serum was separated and used for serum biochemistry.
Reproductive tissues (testis, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal
vesicle, and ventral prostate) and vital organs (liver, kidney,
heart, and adrenal) were blotted free of blood, weighed, and used
for tissue biochemistry and histology.

Body and organ weights
Initial and final body weights of animals were taken before and
after the treatment. The mean value of each of the tissues was
calculated.

Spermatozoa motility and count
The spermatozoa motility was determined according to the method of
Prasad et al [] using WBC counting Neubauer chamber of a
hemocytometer
and was expressed as million spermatozoa/mL
suspension.

Biochemical studies
Protein was estimated by Lowry et al's [] method.
Sialic acid was estimated by the procedure given by
Warren []. Cholesterol was done as per the method of
Zlatkis et al []. Glycogen was estimated by the
method of Montgomery []. Fructose was done by the
method of Foreman et al []. Ascorbic acid was
estimated by the method of Roe and Kuether [].
Acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were
measured by the method of Fiske and Subbarow [].

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthetic
The complexes are colored solids and soluble in most of the
organic solvents like methanol, benzene, dichloromethane,
tetrahydrofuran, and dimethylformamide. Their nonelectrolytic
nature was confirmed by low molar conductance values 15–23 Ohm−1cm2 mol−1. Physical properties and analytical
data of the complexes are given in .

IR spectra
The IR spectra of the starting materials and their iron complexes
were recorded and their comparative study confirmed the formation of
macrocyclic complexes with the proposed coordination pattern. The
bands observed in the region 3420−3531 cm−1 attributed
to −NH2 of amino and 2500−2590 cm−1 attributed
to −OH of the carboxylic acid. Both of these bands
(−NH2 and −OH) disappeared in the
complexes,
confirming the cyclization. A single sharp band is observed at
3132 cm−1 for [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and at 3251 cm−1 for [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] due to
ν(N−H) of the amide group. The appearance of four bands at
1649, 1565, 1271,  and 638 cm−1 for
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2], and 1687, 1561, 1249, and
670 cm−1 for [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] are due
to the amide I, amide II, amide III, and amide IV vibrations,
respectively. The bands at 430 cm−1 for
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and 442 cm−1 for
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] in the spectra of the
complexes may be assigned to (Fe−N) stretching vibrations.
The absorption bands observed in the regions 2880−2910 and
1420−1440 cm−1  in the complexes may be reasonably
assigned to the C−H stretching and bending vibrational modes.

To distinguish between these structures (enolic and amide), we have
synthesized the free ligands and recorded their IR spectra.
Surprisingly, there were no bands for the azomethine group
(&gt;C=N) in the IR spectra of the complexes. This clearly indicated that the amide structure is the real structure
in this case and not the enolic structure. The νasym and
νasy OCO of the acetate group appear at 1480 and
1330 cm−1 (Δν150 cm−1) suggesting
the bonding mode of acetate group []. A sharp band observed
at 482 and 487 cm−1 ascribed to the Fe−O
stretching vibrations in the complexes
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2], respectively. Similar
results have also been confirmed and reported by other authors
[].

Electronic spectra
A weak intensity band exhibited at 11904 and 11278 cm−1
for [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2], respectively, is assigned to
the 5T2g → 5Eg, transitions
consistent with an octahedral geometry for iron(II) complexes.
These assignments are also in tune with the results of Lobana et al [] and Chaudhary et al [] for high-spin
octahedral iron(II) system.

On the basis of the above spectral studies, the derivatives have
been assigned the following structures with hexacoordinated iron
atom ().

Antifertility activity
Body and organ weights
The data revealed that the body weights of rats were  not much
altered  after the treatment of [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]
and [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2], however, in both the
treated groups, a general decrease in the reproductive organ
weights was observed in relation to the control. A significant
reduction was observed in weights of testis (P &lt; 0.01), epididymis
(p &lt; 0.001), seminal vesicle (p &lt; 0.01) and ventral prostate
(p &lt; 0.001) in [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]  treated animals. The treatment of [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] also
resulted in a significant decrease in the weights of testis
(p &lt; 0.001), epididymis (P &lt; 0.001), vas deferens (p &lt; 0.01),
seminal vesicle (p &lt; 0.001), and ventral prostate (p &lt; 0.01).

After the withdrawal of both of the compounds, the results favour
that [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] was comparatively better
in treatment. The vital organs data () also show
similar results as reported for reproductive organs in .

Spermatozoa motility and count
The spermatozoa motility of [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated rats showed that
the sperms were sluggishly motile without any forward progression.
The motility percent after [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]
treatment declined significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Following withdrawal
of the treatment, the sperms were actively motile showing forward
progression and the sperm motility percentage of the above groups
recovered completely to normal level (). The
sperm density of cauda epididymis and testicular sperm density
diminished significantly (p &lt; 0.001) in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated rats and restored
partially following 30 days withdrawal in both the groups ().

Fertility test
Normal proestrous females after mating with the males of proven fertility
deliver on average 8−10 pups per female. The treated animals exhibited
normal libido and mating behaviour, however, in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated animals, the fertility test gave
90% negative fertility rate and in [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2]
treated group, the fertility test was 72% negative. Following withdrawal
of the drug, 25% recovery in fertility rate was observed in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated
 group of the
animals, whereas
42% recovery in fertility  rate was observed in the animals treated with
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] ().

Biochemical changes
Proteins 

The protein concentration of the reproductive
organs was lowered after the treatment of
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] as compared to the control
which was brought to the normal level in testis and cauda
epididymis after the withdrawal of the drug ().
A significant reduction in the protein contents of testis
(p &lt; 0.001), cauda epididymis (p &lt; 0.01), and ventral prostate
(p &lt; 0.001) was observed following the treatment of
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]. The above changed parameters
were restored completely to normal in all the organs after the
withdrawal of the drug ().

Sialic acid

The testicular and cauda epididymal sialic
acid concentration of [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated animals decreased
significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Withdrawal period of 30 days did not
bring much change in the above content ().

Fructose

The fructose concentration of seminal vesicle was
diminished significantly (p &lt; 0.001) in [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]
and [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated animals, which was recovered
to the normal level after the withdrawal of the drug ().

Cholesterol

The cholesterol and testicular cholesterol content of
adrenal increased significantly in [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated animals in comparison to the
control. Withdrawal of the treatment attained the normal cholesterol and
testicular cholesterol level ().

Glycogen

The glycogen concentration of testis was reduced in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated animals as compared to the
control, whereas an increase was observed in the testicular glycogen level in
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated group. The above altered
parameter was restored completely after the withdrawal of the treatments
().

[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated group also resulted
in a significant reduction in the liver glycogen concentration
(p &lt; 0.001), which was brought to normal after the withdrawal of
the treatment. On the contrary, an increase in the concentration
of liver glycogen was evident following the withdrawal ().

Ascorbic acid

Treatment with both the groups resulted in
reduction in the ascorbic acid concentration of testis. This decrease was
more significant (p &lt; 0.001) in [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated
group of rats. A decline in the ascorbic acid concentration was also noticed
in cauda epididymis in both the treated groups.

The decrease was more significant (p &lt; 0.01) in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]. The above altered parameter was brought
to normal following 30 days withdrawal of the drug. ().

Acid and alkaline phosphatase

A significant decrease in the
acid phosphatase content (p &lt; 0.01) of ventral prostate was
observed in the [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated groups, which was
completely restored to normal after the withdrawal in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]. However, a partial recovery
was observed in [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated group
of animals (). Similar reduction was also
evidenced in the concentration of alkaline phosphatase content
(p &lt; 0.05) of ventral prostate of both the groups.

Haematology and serum biochemistry

Haemoglobin and haematocrit
values remained unaltered, indicating normal blood physiology of all the
groups of animals. However, treatment with
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] resulted in increased serum cholesterol
concentration (p &lt; 0.01). The concentrations of VLDL, triglycerides, albumin and A/G ratio were decreased. Treatment with
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] also caused a significant increase in
the serum cholesterol concentration (p &lt; 0.01) while concentration of VLDL
(p &lt; 0.05), triglycerides (p &lt; 0.05), albumin, and A/G ratio decreased. The
protein and glubulin concentration of serum was increased to some extent in
both the treated groups of the animals.

The changes which have been found in the investigating parameters
are found to be restoring to the normal partially or completely
ultimately recovered. The results () indicated
that haemoglobin, haematocrit, protein, and albumin were restored
completely following withdrawal of the test compounds. However,
VLDL, serum, A/G ratio, and glubulin were restored partially after
30 days of the stoppage of the compounds administration.

Serum testosterone

The ELISA test () revealed a significant
reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in circulating serum testosterone in both the  treated groups. Withdrawal of the drug for 30 days restored  the level of serum
testosterone completely in [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] withdrawal
group of rats while partial recovery was observed in
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] withdrawal group of animals.

Histocytometry

The histocytometric data of
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated rats revealed a decrease in the
seminiferous tubule diameters, germinal epithelial cell height (p &lt; 0.001),
and Leydig cell diameter (p &lt; 0.001) of testis along with a significant
decrease in the epithelial cell height (p &lt; 0.001) and muscle layer
thickness (p &lt; 0.001) of cauda epididymis. The epithelial cell height of
seminal vesicle also decreased as compared to the control. A significant
decrease was noticed in the epithelial cell height (p &lt; 0.05) of ventral
prostate and in the muscle layer thickness  and epithelial cell height
(p &lt; 0.05) of vas deferens. The above altered parameters were restored
following the withdrawal of the treatment ().

In [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treated rats, a significant
decrease was noticed in testicular seminiferous tubule diameter
(p &lt; 0.001), germinal epithelial cell height (p &lt; 0.001), and
Leydig cell diameter (p &lt; 0.01). The epithelial cell height of
cauda epididymis decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) with a
decrease in muscle layer thickness. A significant decrease in the
epithelial cell height of seminal vesicle (p &lt; 0.001) and ventral
prostate (p &lt; 0.001) was observed. The muscle layer thickness and
epithelial cell height of vas deferens were also decreased.
Withdrawal of the drug regained the normal levels
().

Discussion

In the present study, the results indicated that
the weights of the body and
vital organs were not affected after the treatment suggesting that
the complexes have no side effect or toxicological effect and
maintained normal physiology of the animals throughout the
experiment.

 NJ Chinoy and MR Chinoy [] reported that the structural and functional integrity of the reproductive organs depends on the
circulating level of the androgen, and any small change in the
androgen level results in the reduction in the weights of the
reproductive organs. In the present studies, decline in the
circulating levels of testosterone was observed in
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated animals leading to a
decrease in the organ weights and androgen-dependent
parameters.

 The reduction in the weight of the testis after the treatment
in the present study related to the loss of spermatozoa and
spermatids, which make up a substantial proportion of testicular
volume, by the same token, as a consequence of disruption of
spermatogenesis [–].

 The suppressed epididymal activity as evidenced by the loss of the
weight and histological alterations might be due to antigonadotropic
activity of the so-termed antiandrogenic/estrogenic substances which lower
the ABP production by the sertoli cell and androgen synthesis by the Leydig
cells, thereby resulting in reduced levels of androgen available to the
epididymis for functional maintenance. The requirement of relatively higher
androgen threshold in the epididymis has already been established by Gupta et al [].

 Reduction in the weights of seminal vesicles, ventral
prostate, and vas deferens, also reflects an interference with
androgen output. Bhiwgade et al [] have
already correlated the reduction in the weights of
sex accessories, particularly of the prostate, following treatment
of cyproterone acetate. Antiandrogens are known to depress the
uptake of testosterone in the prostate and reduce binding of
androgen to the hormonal receptors by a process of competitive
inhibition as reported by Sharma and Jacob
[].

 The sperm density and sperm motility have a direct
relationship to the fertility []. In the present study,
sperm motility and density of testis and cauda epididymis after
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treatments were significantly
declined. Rao [] has reported declined sperm motility,
resulting into decreased  fertility.


Immotile or sluggishly motile spermatozoa cannot penetrate the
cervical mucus, thus fail to fertilize the ova []. During
the present course of the study, 90% negative fertility rate was
observed after [Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] treatment,
while it was 72% negative in the
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] treated animals.
It appears
worthwhile to conclude that reduction in the sperm counts and
motility recorded in treated animals substantiates the
antifertility activity. Further, alteration in the various
androgen-dependent biochemical parameters that in turn altered the
internal milieu  of the epididymis [] may also be
responsible for the negative fertility test. Withdrawal for 30
days in the groups treated with
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2] showed significant recovery
in the fertility rate, indicating that the effects brought about
the synthetic compounds were reversible.

 Protein is involved in the alteration of almost every
physiological system and the total protein run parallel to the
growth and is sensitive to estrogen and androgen, respectively,
reported by Davis et al []. Jones
[] has
reported that protein level is directly correlated  with the
secretory activity of the epididymis, which in turn depends on the
androgen levels.

In the present investigations, the reduction in the protein concentration by
the treatment may be attributed to the reduction in secretory activity
because of the androgen deprivation effect. Kamal et al [] and Mali et al [] also reported similar results for the male albino rats.

 Nag et al [] have reported that an optimal level of sialic acid
in reproductive organs is essential for functional integrity of spermatozoa.
Our observations are in consonance with those of Gupta and Ahmed
[] who have reported a decrease in sialic acid concentration of testis, cauda
epididymis, seminal vesicle, and ventral prostate to albino rats.
Bhargava [] reported decrease in the testicular sialic acid
concentration due to the antispermatogenic activity.

 Mammalian cells require cholesterol
which plays an important
role in acting as precursor molecule in the synthesis of steriod
hormone []. The requirement of cholesterol for normal activity
of testicular glands has been well established by Biswas, Deb, and Johnson [, ].
Androgens are synthesized from cholesterol, but increased
concentration may result in the reduction of fertility [].

After the treatment with the effective doses of both the compounds,
there was a significant increase in the testicular and adrenal
cholesterol concentration which is in consonance with the results
of Kamal et al [], suggesting that the increased testicular
cholesterol concentration may be correlated with its
nonutilization by the system leading to a fall in circulatory
androgen in rats due to the antiandrogenic activity.


 Baijal et al [] proposed that glycogen might
represent a source of nourishment for the spermatozoa during
its development and maturation. The glycogen level declined in
testis and liver of the rats treatment with
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2]. Kamal et al [] have
reported decreased concentration of glycogen in the rats due to
its androgen dependence, leading to various disorders in testis.


In contrast, treatment with [Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2]
caused a nonsignificant increase in the concentration of glycogen
of both the liver and testis. The same case has been reported by
Ewing et al []. Increased carbohydrate utilization has been
considered due to androgenic stimulation suggesting a direct
correlation between testosterone secretion rate and glucose uptake
by the isolated and perfused rabbit testis
as reported by Ewing et al [].

 After treatment with effective doses of
[Fe(TAML1)(CH3COO)2] and
[Fe(TAML2)(CH3COO)2], there was a decrease in the
testicular and cauda epididymal ascorbic acid concentration,
which is in consonance with that of Chaterjee et al
[] who reported hypofunctioning of
testis and the degeneration of the germinal epithelium due to
vitamin C deficiency.

 Decline in acid phosphate level might be due to
antiandrogenic effect or might be due to suppressed secretory
function of the prostate [, , ]. The acid phosphate
values during present course of the study concur with the
findings of Jacob et al [].

Administration of the test substances resulted in a significant
reduction in the alkaline phosphate content of the ventral
prostate. It is evident that this decrease was a likely
consequence of spermatogenic arrest as a result of suppression of
androgenesis. This observation concurs with the findings of others
also [, , ], who reported a general decline in the alkaline
phosphate content  of the various reproductive and accessory organs
of the male rats after androgen-estrogen therapy.
