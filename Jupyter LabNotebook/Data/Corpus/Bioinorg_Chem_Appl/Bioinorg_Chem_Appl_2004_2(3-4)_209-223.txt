ABSTRACT
The effect of surfactants on the biodegradation of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene,
chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene by an Escherichia coli JMI09(MI) recombinant strain, carrying a
gene cluster containing the genes for benzene dioxygenase, cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and
catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida ML2, has been investigated.
We observed that the efficiency of the benzene dioxygenase catalyzed conversions to cis-dihydrodiols
depends on the balance among real substrate specificity, bioavailability, and toxicity effects of highly
concentrated aromatic hydrocarbons. The utilization of non ionic surfactants makes it possible to partly
overcome the limiting step of biodegradation processes for scarcely water soluble hydrocarbons hindered by
their limited bioavailability.
Furthermore the cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase and the extradiol catechol 2,3-dioxygenase,
which in the presently analyzed biodegradative pathway should further degrade the pollutants, are known, the
first to be selectively specific for the (lR,2R)-dihydrodiol derivative which is not produced by the benzene
dioxygenase, the second, to be dead-end inhibited by the corresponding chlorinated catechois. In the present
example this results in the accumulation of the corresponding chlorinated cis-dihydrodiols which can be
useful for asymmetric synthesis.
On the other hand the practical utilization ofthe system for bioremediation purposes requires the efficient

conversion ofthe chlorinated catechols by specific intradiol ring-cleaving dioxygenases, the crystal structures
of some of these last enzymes are currently under analysis in our laboratory to understand the structural-
functional correlations. Preliminary data show overall structures similar to the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from
Acinetobacter sp. ADP1 thus suggesting that the substrate specificity differences are mainly related to subtle
differences in the catalytic site.

INTRODUCTION
Remediative or synthetic technologies based on microbial traiJformations of hydrocarbons
(biotransformations hereafter) are becoming every day more relevant. In particular in situ processes for the
removal of polluting aromatic hydrocarbons can potentially benefit of the capabilities of enzymatic systems
in terms of faster and gentle treatment conditions, reduced environmental pollution, and low costs /1,2/.
Furthermore environmentally benign procedures utilizing such enzymes have interesting applications for the
synthesis of useful chemicals/3-7/.
The aerobic biotransformation of aromatic hydrocarbons always require the action of oxygenases, often
containing iron ions essential for the catalysis of the aromatic ring hydroxylation and the consecutive ring
opening/8,9/. In bioproduction processes however the use of isolated enzymes is not realistic mainly because
hydroxylating oxygenases are unstable multi-component systems difficult to purify and requiring expensive
co-substrates/10,11/. Therefore technologies using whole cells engineered microorganisms which provide
for the over-expression ofsuch enzymatic systems have been developed/12, 13/.
Pseudomonas putida ML2, a microorganism first described in 1973, is able to utilize benzene as the sole
carbon and energy source/14/. This bacterium oxidizes benzene to cis-l,2-dihydroxy-cyclohexa-3,5-diene
(cis-benzene dihydrodioi) through the addition of both atoms of dioxygen to the aromatic nucleus (reaction
catalyzed by benzene 1,2-dioxygenase, (BDO)). Afterwards the product is oxidized to catechol by a cis-
dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (BCD). Finally catechol is further converted through oxygenative ring cleaving
by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C2,30) to a-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde which after a few reactions enters
the regular carbon cycle (see Scheme 1)/I 5-18/.

One of the main drawbacks in biotransformation processes of aromatic hydrocarbons is generally the very
low rate of catalysis due to a variety of factors such as the scarce mass transfer rate of the hydrophobic
substrates, the restricted enzymatic substrate specificity, and the toxicity effects exerted by such compounds
on micro-organisms/12/.
In the present work we will mainly focus on bioavailability limitations to efficient biotransformation
procedures, briefly mentioning the aspect ofenzymatic specificity for chlorobenzenes.
Regarding bioavailability two-phase systems (like water/organic solvents) in which the major component
is an organic solvent able to solubilize iarg quantities of the hydrophobic pollutants have been formulated,
the major drawback being that frequently the cell viability is fairly reduced after only few hours due to the
toxic effects ofthe organic phase/19,20].
Living systems accomplish high levels of selectivity and efficiency using compartmentalization through
self assembling systems often composed by amphiphatic units similar to those of synthetic surfactants which
form micellar systems above the critical micellar concentration /21-23/. Direct micelles are capable to
solubilize amounts of apolar compounds in their core/24-26/. Such systems can be regarded as chemical
microreactors, where hydrophobic substances stored in the apolar center can diffuse to the hydrophilic
aqueous medium or directly to the adjoining cell membranes/27/.
Micellar phases in microbial bioconversions have been observed to be milder than vigorous mixing of
multiphasic media, and the effective improvement of conversion kinetics has been investigated into details
for polyaromatic hydrocarbons /28-31/. In such cases high substrate conversion rates and yields were
observed together with high cell viabilities.
Regarding enzyme specificity we can remark that the removal of contaminant mixtures from polluted
environments is particularly challenging. In fact mixtures of halogenated and alkylated aromatic
hydrocarbons are widely spread pollutants and generally the degradation pathways for haloaromatics differ
considerably from those of the alkyl-substituted analogues. In particular the ring cleaving dioxygenases
involved in the transformation of alkyl-aromatics are generally ofthe extradiol type whereas those implicated
in the cleavage of halogenated aromatics belong to the intradiol class. Strict substrate specificities are also
observed among enzymes belonging to the same class of dioxygenases. Only one exception of extradiol
cleaving dioxygenase able to catalize the cleavage ofhaloaromatics has been recently observed/32-34/.
The understanding of the structural factors which cause the observed enzymatic specificities has to be
regarded as crucial for the design ofmore efficient bioremediation techniques.
In the present paper the influence of bioavailability on the efficiency of biotransformation processes for
aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene and chloroaromatics like chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene is
examined.
The data clearly show reduced affinities of the benzene dioxygenase for the chlorinated compounds
although the presence of micellar systems contributes to increase the transformation rates and yields.
Anyway the surfactant does not allow to change the real substrate specificities and to prevent the inactivation
of the extradio! ring cleaving dioxygenases, it is known that the normal intradiol catechol dioxygenases are
unable to cleave chlorocatechols; therefore we have started to determine the x-ray structures of some

intradiol dioxygenases specializing in the cleavage of 4-chlorocatechol and hydroxyquinol to reveal the
factors essential for substrate selectivity.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
Triton XI00, benzene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-chlorobenzene, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich S.r.1.
(Milan, Italy). Water was purified in a reverse osmosis Milli-Ro system and subsequently treated with a
Milli-Q system (Millipore). All the other chemicals were ofthe best purity available.
Microorganisms
The E. coli JMI09(MI) recombinant strain carrying benzene dioxygenase where DNA shuffling was
applied to bedCl gene (reductase component), cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and the catechol 2,3-
dioxygenase cloned from Pseudomonas putida ML2 was used for the biodegradation studies and kindly
supplied by Dr. J.R. Mason (King's College, London, UK). Such a biological system is able to catalyze the
conversion of benzene and other aromatic compounds to the corresponding semialdehydes as previously
reported 14-16/.
Culture media and conditions
E. coli inocula were initially grown in LB medium plus ampicillin 100 g/ml for 8-12 hours then
transferred to M9 medium additioned with succinate 20 mM and the appropriate surfactant under standing or
stirring conditions at 30C/35/. The expression ofthe dioxygenases cluster was constitutive.
Viability experiments were performed by plating estimated amounts of cells, obtained after dilution with
LB medium, on LB-agar plates. After 12-18 hours incubation at 30C the grown colonies, corresponding to
the viable cells, were manualiy counted.
Bioconversion experiments were performed at 30C, 100-200 rpm orbital shaking, adding to fresh M9
medium with the appropriate concentrations of surfactant, oil, hydrocarbon, and 1.6x l09
cells/ml
corresponding to about 60-80 Units/liter ofbenzene dioxygenase activity.
One unit of dioxygenase activity is defined as the amount of cells producing mol of 1,2-dihydro-l,2-
dihydroxybenzene in rain under the test conditions.
HPLC determination of bioconversions kinetics
Reverse phase C18 columns (4.6 x 150 mm) connected to a Waters HPLC Alliance 2690 and a Waters
996 photodiode array detector (Milford, MA, U.S.A.) both interfaced to personal computers were used under
isocratic flows (55 % methanol, 45 % water supplemented with g/l H3PO4) of ml/min for the analysis of
212
Demetrio Randazzo et al.. Bioinorganic Chemistry and Applications
the reaction mixtures. 5-20 tl samples were injected after 3' centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and 4C. The
absorbance of the eluate was monitored between 200 and 600 nm. The concentrations of compounds at
different times during the kinetic runs have been determined from the areas of the corresponding peaks. All
experiments were carried out in duplicate and the values reported are means.
Analysis of Bioconversion Products
The products generated by the bioconversions of benzene, toluene and ethylbenzene catalyzed by the E.
coli JM109(MI) recombinant strain carrying the genes cluster cloned from P. putida ML2 were analyzed
using LC-MS and UV-Vis spectroscopy techniques.
For the liquid chromatography-mass (LC-MS) experiments, a Micromass/Waters ZMD 2000 quadrupole
system, connected to a Waters Alliance 2690 HPLC was used (Milford, MA, U.S.A.). The mass spectrometer
was calibrated using NaCsl2. A mass range of 20-300 amu was scanned and the data were acquired with the
MassLynx NT 3.5 data system.
UV-Vis Spectroscopy
UV measurements were carried out on double beam Varian Cary 3 spectrophotometers using 1.0-0.1 cm
path length Hellma 110 quartz suprasil cells.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The cluster of enzymes: benzene dioxygenase, cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and the catechol
2,3-dioxygenase cloned from Pseudomonas putida ML2, utilized in the present investigation, is known to
convert benzene and, with lower efficiencies, other substituted monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to the
corresponding semialdehydes/14-16/.
To increase the efficiency of the system under investigation DNA shuffling experiments on the bedCl
gene (reductase component) of BDO made it possible to obtain the present clone which shows an enhanced
catalytic activity towards benzene conversion to the corresponding semialdehyde (250-300 % enhancement
was observed with respect to the native system) (personal communication, Dr. J.R. Mason, King's College,
London, UK) 14-16/.
With the exception of benzene, the solubility of which is around 23 mM in water systems at 20C, the
limited solubilities of the other substrates tested in water media (see Table 1) could not allow optimal
conversion rates. Possible approaches to more efficient biotransformation processes could employ a two
phase system but the contact area between the two phases which should influence the substrate transfer rate is
scarce even under vigorous stirring /19, 20/. A much higher contact surface can be obtained in micro-
compartmentalized media, where the hydrophobic substrates are dispersed down to nanometer sized droplets
stabilized by a surfactant monolayer.

Dilute direct micellar systems made using suitable non-ionic surfactants can increase the hydrophobic
substrate solubility and provide a less aggressive environment for bacterial cells/27-31/. For this reason we
utilized 1.5% v/v of non-ionic Triton XI00(R) (t-octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol) in the mineral culture
medium (M9) for the E. coli strain containing the genes for the overexpression of the benzene dioxygenase
cluster (see Experimental).
A general property of L micellar solutions is their ability to solubilize a certain amount of hydrophobic
additives. It has been reported that the solute localization in the micellar micro-compartment is directly
related to its hydrophobicity, so that the more polar or polarizable compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons
are preferentially found in the so called palisade layer where they interact with the polar group/21, 22/.
Previous studies on microemulsion systems showed that higher apparent solubilities for polyaromatic
hydrocarbons provided higher conversion rates and yields/28-31/.
The bacterial strain viabilities in selected surfactant modified media were tested under stirring and
standing conditions and provided evidence ofoptimal growth environments/28].
As expected on the basis of benzene water solubility, the addition of Triton X100 1.5% to the
bioconversion environment for such substrate did not provide any further improvement in mass transfer rates
and therefore the conversion rates and yields were not enhanced (data not shown).
In such micellar solutions it was possible to raise the real benzene concentration even above 50 mM but
increasing the substrate concentration from 10 to 20 and to 40 mM resulted in substantial reductions of the
conversion rates due to toxicity problems (see Figure 1). It is known that the addition of benzene and other
mono-aromatic hydrocarbons to the culture medium yields the accumulation of such compounds in the
hydrophobic segment of the bacterial membrane causing an increased permeability of the cytoplasmic
membrane and resulting in impaired bacterial growth due to metabolic energy losses and macromolecules
leakage/36-38/. Consequently the final conversion yield that for 10 mM (and lower concentrations) benzene
214

concentration was 100% was reduced to about 80 % and 65 % for 20 and 40 mM starting benzene
concentration respectively.

The final cell concentration of the induced E. coli JM109(MI) recombinant strain resulted to be 1.6
x 109 cells/ml. The kinetics were run at 30C and 140 rpm.
In order to prevent metabolic energy losses we tried to further add mM NADH or 10 mM ethanol to the
culture medium but this did not show any appreciable effect on the conversion process rates and final yields.
The conversion kinetics for chlorobenzene in M9 minimal medium and Triton X I00/M9 solutions (1.5%
w/w in surfactant) are illustrated in Figure 2. Contrarily to what was observed for benzene, the addition ofthe
non ionic surfactant produces enhancements of the overall conversion rates at 5 mM initial substrate
concentration and a four-fold increase of the final yield. As in the case of benzene the doubling of the initial
concentration for the aromatic hydrocarbon (in this case from 5 to 10 mM) causes substantial reductions of
the catalytic rates due to the toxic effects of such substrate (data not shown).

LC-MS experiments allowed us to confirm and quantify the products of chlorobenzene conversion. As
observed in scheme II the action of benzene 1,2-dioxygenase on chlorobenzene results mainly in the
formation of 1S,2S-3-chloro-cis-l,2-dihydroxy-l,2-dihydrocyclohexa-3,5-diene which is not further
converted into the corresponding catechol or semialdehyde due to the specificity limitations of the
corresponding cis-benzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas
putida ML2 /39,40]. In fact a recent study showed that the presently investigated cis-benzene dihydrodiol
dehydrogenase is not able to convert (1S,2S)-3-chloro-cis-l,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrocyclohexa-3,5-diene to
the resulting catechol since it has a selective preference for the (IR,2R) enantiomer which is not produced by
BDO/41/.
The formation oftraces (<0.2%) of 2-chloro-phenol probably a decomposition product ofthe starting diol
has also been observed. In table 2 are reported the results of products quantification for chlorobenzene
conversion in the different media.

Similar results were obtained analyzing the 1,2-dichlorobenzene conversion. In Figure 3 are reported the
conversion kinetics for 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 5 mM initial concentration with or without the addition of
TritonXl00 1.5% w/w to the M9 medium. The addition ofthe surfactant supports a more efficient conversion
of 1,2-dichlorobenzene due to the increased substrate bioavailability, resulting in a six-fold final yield
increase.
Also in the case of 1,2-dichlorobenzene the substrate specificity of benzene 1,2-dioxygenase drives
towards the formation of 3,4-dichloro-cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrocyclohexa-3,5-diene that accumulates in

In conclusion the utilization of direct micellar systems able to solubilize aromatic hydrocarbons at high
concentrations can allow improvement to a certain extent of the efficiency of biotransformation processes by
increasing substrate transfer rates. The present study has also allowed it to be determined that the apparent
lower affinity of BDO for chloro-benzene and 1,2-dichloro-benzene than for benzene can be partly overcome
in micellar systems where the utilization of suitable surfactants can considerably improve the mass transfer
rates and consequently the final product yields.
Furthermore the stringent selectivities of BCD and C2,30 cause the accumulation of significant amounts
of interesting chirai synthons that are known to be useful for fine chemicals production/3-7,43/.

The formation and accumulation of intermediates during the biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons
also have implications in the treatment of contaminated waters and gases. In fact many of the observed
intermediates are toxic to humans and other organisms in the environment and furthermore such catabolites
contain most of the initial COD (chemical oxygen demand) and all ofthe dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of
the original compounds. Therefore the treatment of the aromatic hydrocarbons contamination results to be
successful only when the intermediates are also removed/44,45/.
The limitations in biodegradative capacities of different bacteria are mainly due to the presence and
nature of the substituents on the dihydroxybenzene ring. Whereas the unsubstituted catechol can be
transformed via all pathways, methylated catechois derived from most natural and non-halogenated
compounds are assimilated by the meta-cleavage pathway only /46,47/. Unfortunately meta-cleavage
dioxygenases as the above reported C2,30 from P. putida ML2 are rapidly inactivated by chlorocatechols
due to the formation of reactive acyl chlorides; therefore such classes of compounds are typically catabolized
via the modified ortho-cleavage pathway which on the other hand.is not suitable for methyl-substituted
aromatics due to the formation of dead-end methyl-lactones/39,40,48,49/. The simultaneous biodegradation
of chloro- and methyl-substituted aromatics often present as mixtures at contaminated sites is possible only
by particular bacterial consortia or ofparticular bacterial strains such as the P. putida GJ31 which contains an
unusual meta-cleavage dioxygenase able to convert chlorocatechols/32-34].
As mentioned above, intradiol dioxygenases have crucial roles in the modified ortho-cleavage pathway
for the biotransformation of halogenated aromatics. Until now only the X-ray structures of a few intradiol
dioxygenases have been determined showing large differences in oligomeric structures and sequence
homologies/50-55/. These data, together with the information obtained through XAS experiments, are not
sufficient to establish the roles ofthe active site residues in substrate selectivity/56/.
X-ray diffraction studies are in progress in our laboratory for a number of intradiol dioxygenases involved
in haiogenated aromatic catabolism with different substrate specificities: the hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase
from Nocardioides simplex 3E, the 4-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase and the 3-chlorocatechol 1,2-
dioxygenase both from Rhodococcus opacus CP/57-59/. In particular studies on the two chlorocatechol 1,2-
dioxygenases involved respectively in the degradation pathways for 4-chlorophenol (4-chlorocatechol 1,2-
dioxygenase) and 2-chlorophenol (3-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase) from Rhodococcus opacus CP
ascertained that these enzymes differ significantly in their catalytic properties/60,61/.
Our preliminary analysis of the x-ray data shows that the overall crystal structures of these enzymes are
very similar to that of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Acinetobacter Sp. ADPI in terms of quaternary
structure arrangements, molecular domains and active site positioning (see Figure 4 for hydroxyquinol 1,2-
dioxygenase from Nocardioides simplex 3E, and 4-chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Rhodococcus
opacus CP) /62/. The refined three-dimensional structures of these enzymes with different substrate
specificities will provide details on the influence of the active site conformation and aminoacid substitutions
involved in substrate selectivity and it will also further improve the knowledge of the catalytic mechanism of
this class ofdioxygenases.
Only a multidisciplinary approach investigating substrate bioavailability, enzyme specificity and efficiency
and utilizing a variety of techniques such as molecular biotechnology, enzyme structure and mechanism
