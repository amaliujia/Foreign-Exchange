1. INTRODUCTION
High-level quantum mechanical electronic structure methodologies
have known a spectacular development over the past two decades
[, ], improving dramatically the accuracy of molecular
geometry and energy calculations. For instance, it is currently
possible to predict heat of formation values and reaction
enthalpies to within 0.5 kcal mol−1, depending on the size of
the system and the degree to which the molecule is well described
by a single reference function. An area that has largely profited
from this progress is the class of  “highly correlated”
molecules, that is, species possessing relatively low lying excited
electronic states that affect the description of the ground or
reference state through coupling from the correlation operator. A
well-known set of highly correlated compounds are those that
contain different electronegative elements bonded together as
several species of atmospheric significance do, which contain
halogen-oxygen bonds.

In stratospheric chemistry, halogen peroxides and their isomers are formed
as intermediate complexes in the coupling of halogen monoxides
			                   
The halogen atoms thus released reattack new ozone molecules
leading to a catalytic ozone depletion cycle. Systematic
experimental studies have observed IR absorption spectra for
several simple and cross halogen peroxides and polyoxides while
some members have been isolated at 220° K which is the
temperature prevailing in the stratospheric layer. The halogen
monoxide radicals also interact with the hydroxyl  HO•,
methyl CH3•, hydroperoxy HO2•, and
methylperoxy CH3O2• radicals species
abundant in the lower and upper atmosphere and give interesting
reactions that participate in tropospheric ozone depletion cycles
and in various hydrocarbon oxidation processes in atmospheric and
combustion chemistry

Due to their importance [–], the study of
halogen polyoxides, (YXO2) and (YXO3), Y = Cl, Br, I,
H, CH3, X = Cl, Br, I, has known intense
theoretical and experimental investigations and has become one of
the major chapters in halogen physical inorganic chemistry
[, ].

The purpose of the present study is to examine the significant differences in the properties of normal valent and multivalent halogen-oxygen bonding in a series of chlorine, bromine and iodine containing polyoxides. This examination allows us to formulate a qualitative correlation model that
links the structural variations and the energy stabilization tendencies among the various members with the degree of halogen valence, the ionicity of X–O bonding, and the electrostatic character of the Y, YO fragments.

2. COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
As noted in the introduction, the quantum mechanical
characterization of halogen polyoxides has been a subject of
continuous and intense investigations in the recent literature. In
the present work, the (YXO2) and (YXO3) isomers have been
systematically optimized, all species at the same level of theory
to allow a proper comparison of various molecular properties. More
than fifty structures have been investigated in total. The MP2
method in combination with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set [] has
been used for all members of the Cl and Br families. For the
treatment of I in the iodine polyoxides, the LANL2DZ basis set
[] has been employed, augmented with additional two-d and
one-f polarization functions taken from the Stutgart-Bonn quantum
chemistry package []. The computations have been carried
out using the Gaussian 98 series of programs [].

The calculated equilibrium geometries have been found consistent
with the literature results wherever available
[–], that have been obtained by employing either higher
ab initio methodologies or density functional theory techniques
combined with very large basis sets, depending on the
computational resources available. For instance, Guha and
Francisco have carried out the investigation of the
(YBrO2), Y = H, Cl, Br, and (YBrO3), Y = H, CH3,
isomers using the B3LYP functional in combination with the large
6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set and the QCISD/6-31D(d) methodology
[, , ]. In our laboratory, the members of the
(CH3XO2) series, X = Cl, Br, I, have also been
investigated at various levels of theory [, , ].

Regarding the energy computations, higher than MP2 theory
calculations are required to make a reliable study of the
energetics of all these systems. Opposite to the equilibrium
geometry optimizations, accurate energy and relative stability
computations for these adducts have been found to be very
demanding and are very frequently quite sensitive to the
theoretical method applied with severe discrepancies from one
method to another. Such methodologies are beyond the capability of
the present investigation, taking into account the large number of
systems examined. However, the good agreement of the present
optimizations, with various higher level structural calculations
reported, allows us to use energy results previously published to
analyze the dependence of the thermodynamic stability on the
properties of X–O bonding. Thus, we discuss the relative
energy and heat of formation tendencies and the correlation with
the halogen valence and the Y, YO electronegativities, on
the basis of collected literature results that have been obtained
with the use of three different high level methodologies, namely,
G2MP2, CCSD(T), and QCISD(T).

Harmonic vibrational frequencies have also been calculated along
with the structural optimizations. They verify that all isomeric
structures investigated represent energy minima on the
corresponding potential energy surfaces. As an example,
 summarizes the calculated harmonic vibrational
frequencies for the isomers of the (ClBrO2) and (IClO3) families.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selected structural results for the (YClOn), (YBrOn), and (YIOn), Y = Cl, Br, I, H, CH3, n = 2, 3 isomers, calculated as described above, are collected in Tables
–. Depending on the position of the oxygen atom within the molecule, two kinds of X–O bonds (X = halogen atom) are distinguished, that is, with the O atom either located at a terminal position or within the molecule bound to another atom (bridged oxygen). When the X–O bond involves a
terminal oxygen atom, it presents multiple bond properties and the corresponding halogen atom is characterized as hypervalent displaying more than 8 electrons in the valence shell. The
interesting feature of the bonds  between multivalent halogen atoms and terminal oxygen atoms  is the severe tightening of the bond distance that does not correlate with the bond strength.
Multiple X–O bonds exhibit a strikingly smaller equilibrium distance compared to the normal valent X–O length, a difference much more pronounced in the halogen case than, for
instance, the difference in bond length between single and multiple carbon bonds.

3.1. Trends in the structural parameters of (YClO2), (YBrO2), and (YIO2) families, Y = Cl, Br, I, H, CH3
Three types of isomeric structures have been determined in this series, the
peroxide normal valent YOOX form, the YOXO structure which
contains both bridged and terminal oxygen-halogen bonds, and the
fully hypervalent structure YXO2. The equilibrium X–O
distances calculated present a wide range of values from the
normal valent peroxide to the other isomers. For example, the
Cl–O distance decreases from 1.756 Å in ClOOCl to
1.469 Å in ClClO2, a striking shrinkage of
∼0.3 Å. The ClOClO isomer presents three
different types of Cl–O bonding. The bond that involves bridged
Cl and O atoms is the longest, 1.909 Å, becoming
1.716 Å for the terminal Cl-bridged O bond and
1.512 Å between bridged Cl and terminal O, a net decrease
of 0.4 Å. For comparison reasons, we may note that the Cl–O
distance in free ClO radical has been calculated to be
1.576 Å at the same theory level. Similar large changes
take place in all other halogen families with fully hypervalent
halogen-terminal oxygen bond distance considerably tighter than
the normal valent bonding. In the (YBrO2) family, for instance,
the Br–O equilibrium length varies from 1.905 Å to
1.597 Å, again a range of the order of ∼0.3 Å.

3.2. Trends in the structural parameters of (YXO3) species
For Y = halogen atom, three types of isomers are obtained, the peroxide form, YOOOX, the fully hypervalent, YXO3, and the mixed one, YOXO2. As an example,  displays  the optimized structures of (IClO3)
family. When Y = H, CH3, a fourth isomeric structure has been determined, that is, the HOOXO, CH3OOXO geometries. In all (YXO3), the largest X–O distances are found for the bonds in which both halogen and oxygen atoms are bridged while the
shortest X–O bond lengths have been calculated for the fully hypervalent structures YXO3. The Cl–O bond distance in ClClO3, 1.418 Å, is the shortest ever calculated for a Cl–O bond while the bridged O-bridged Cl in ClOClO2, 2.032 Å, is the largest calculated for bound species. Similar large changes take place in the other halogen families and the same trends observed in (YXO2) are observed in the (YXO3). However, the deviations between largest and shortest bond lengths are even more emphasized in the (YXO3)
than in the (YXO2) series.

3.3. Trends in relative energetics and thermodynamic stability
Relative energy values, displayed with respect to the electronic energies of the normal valent peroxide compounds, are summarized in Tables -. They are mainly based on literature results calculated with the G2MP2 method but CCSD(T) and QCISD(T) reported values are also discussed when
discrepancies with the G2MP2 values are encountered.

The general feature emerging from the inspection of the relative
energy results is the absence of evidence for any correlation
between the magnitude of the X–O bond length and the
stabilization of the corresponding isomer. In fact, the fully
hypervalent structures of the type YXO3 that contain the
shortest X–O distances and the highest degree of halogen
multivalence are the most unstable. On the other hand, the
stabilization tendencies show an interesting dependence on the
electronegativity of the Y, YO partners, a factor that must
be examined in combination with the halogen partial atomic charge
distributions. For example, the following Mulliken atomic charge
distributions have been determined:
			                 
  
These examples readily demonstrate that multivalent halogens
exhibit considerable positive partial charge distributions
increasing from hypervalent Cl to hypervalent I and indicating
that the corresponding X–O bonds are highly ionic. A direct
consequence is the increase in stabilization achieved when the
strongly electropositively charged hypervalent halogen combines
with an electronegative Y, YO partner. Several examples
may be considered that demonstrate this correlation. For
instance, the ClBrO2 structure is more stable than
BrClO2 since the more electropositively charged
hypervalent Br is connected to the more electronegative normal
valent Cl. Another example is the YOClO2, YOBrO2, Y =
H, CH3 compounds where the hypervalent, positively charged
Cl, Br atoms connect to the highly electronegative YO fragments.
These complexes compete in stability with the peroxide normal
valent forms YOOOCl, YOOOBr, and their classification is very
sensitive to the method applied. At the CCSD(T)/6-311G(d,p),
QCISD(T)/6-311G(d,p) levels of theory [, ], they are placed
only ∼1-2 kcal/mol above the normal valent
peroxide structures, while at the G2MP2 level they are found to
be even more stable by ∼2-3 kcal/mol
[, , ]. The corresponding I containing isomer, the iodic
acid HOIO2, presents particular stability and it is far
more stable than the normal valent peroxide isomer HOOOI, as we
will see in the next paragraph. On the other hand, the high
instability of the fully hypervalent configurations
HClO2, HBrO2, CH3ClO2,
CH3BrO2, HClO3, HBrO3,
CH3ClO3, CH3BrO3 may be readily
explained when it is realized that the electropositively charged
hypervalent halogen is necessarily connected to the
electropositive H, CH3 partners. We suggest that the
correlation of the ionic character of X–O bonding and the
electrostatic character of the Y, YO fragments is a major
factor affecting the stabilization of the corresponding
polyoxide, that has not been given so far the appropriate
attention required.

A related parameter that also influences the relative stability order appears to be the degree of valence on the halogen. The isomers ClOClO, BrOBrO are less stable than ClClO2, BrBrO2 despite having the hypervalent halogen also connected to an electronegative fragment such as ClO and BrO. The difference must most probably rely on the lower degree of halogen
valence in the former compounds, which evidently plays also an important role in the stabilization process and becomes another significant factor affecting the stability of the compound. It
has been suggested [] that the multivalent configuration on the halogen is achieved when one, two, or three lone-pair valence electrons acquire a considerable amount of d character and form two, four, or six additional pd hybrid halogen bonds. The
“energetic cost” of the first partial p→d promotion in the YOXO species is obviously only partly recovered by the X–O double bond. Once however, some pd hybridization has taken place, the energy level decreases and the mixing of the second lone-pair
electrons is suggested [] to occur much easier. This analysis
[] indicates that hypervalent halogen species with more than
five bonds, such as the YXO3 species which contain seven bonds on the valence shell, will require the participation of the third halogen valence lone-pair electrons, that is, the s valence
electrons [] having already acquired some p character. Such a
hybridization is obviously very costly and the YXO3 species are quite unstable thermodynamically as shown from the calculated results. We may conclude by saying that there appears to be an optimum degree of valence for stabilization which is five bonds around the halogen atom.

3.4. Particular features of the iodine oxides
The tendencies described above are most convincingly demonstrated in the hypervalent I series. The lower electronegativity of I compared to Cl, Br allows hypervalent iodine to carry a much larger positive charge distribution and enhances remarkably the ionic nature of I–O bonding. We have for example the following partial charge distributions:
            	


As a result, the oxides containing hypervalent iodine are usually
more stable than the normal valent isomers. Thus, in contrast to
the YOClO, YOBrO species discussed above, YOIO isomers are more
stable than the normal valent peroxide compounds YOOI, despite
the lower degree of valence involved. In fact, the hypervalent I
compounds are usually very stable thermodynamically and one of
them, iodic acid HOIO2, a white powdered solid, is even
stable at room temperature. Also methyl iodate
CH3OIO2, because of its thermodynamic stability, is
found to operate as a reservoir species for iodine in the marine
boundary layer []. The only exceptions are the fully
hypervalent HIO2, HIO3, CH3IO2,
CH3IO3 isomers where the hypervalent I may only form a
weak bond with the electropositive H, CH3 fragments
producing also unstable adducts like the Cl, Br analogues.

3.5. Heat of formation values
The most appropriate measure of the actual thermodynamic stability of chemical species is the heat of formation values, ΔHf, which allow a direct comparison among various compounds. Several computed values in the present laboratory as well as various literature results are summarized in . For comparison the maternal compound, HOOH, is also included. The table shows that low heat of formation
values are calculated for the normal-valent cross hydrogen-halogen peroxides of the type HOOX. Among the multivalent species low heat of formation values are computed for the acidic derivatives HOXO, HOXO2, and the methyl analogs CH3OXO2, X = Cl, Br, I, which may be considered relatively stable at room temperature. The polyoxides that involve two halogen atoms are usually unstable and present very short lifetimes, having been detected only spectroscopically as bound short-lived intermediates in the kinetic investigation of various atmospheric processes or in matrix isolation studies. As a rule the iodine containing species are the most stable halogen
polyoxides.

4. SUMMARY
The halogen-oxygen bonding properties in the (YXO2) and (YXO3)
polyoxides, Y = Cl, Br, I, H, CH3 and X = Cl, Br, I, have
been examined. The analysis shows that multivalent bonding
presents a strong ionic nature and affects the structural
characteristics and the thermodynamic stabilization trends. The
X–O bond distance decreases considerably in the fully hypervalent
compounds but its variations do not correlate with energy
stability order. From the analysis presented, the thermodynamic
stability and the relative stability order of the various isomers
are suggested to result from the combination of three factors:
(a) the electrostatic nature of the Y, YO fragments, (b) the
electronegativity of the halogen, and (c) the degree of halogen
valence in the formation of the hypervalent bonds.
