In the references of the published paper entitled “Synthesis and Characterization of New Palladium(II) Thiosemicarbazone Complexes and Their Cytotoxic Activity against Various Human Tumor Cell Lines,” we mistakenly wrote the names of the authors in reference [5], so the corrected reference [5] is as follows: I. Kizilcikli, Y. D. Kurt, B. Akkurt et al., “Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their ZnII and PdII Complexes,” Folia Microbiologica, vol. 52, pp. 15–25, 2007.
