ABSTRACT
The chemical design of metal complexes of the type [Cu(phen)(antib)]+
(where antib is a quinolone or a
fluoroquinolone) has been carried out in an approach to better understand how the coordination of their
components affect the activity of quinolones. The ability of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
to interact with DNA in vivo
and its capacity to promote the degradation of plasmid and chromosomal DNA, under reductive conditions
has been previously reported. However whether this compound utilizes other intracellular targets to promote
bacterial killing was a question that deserved to be answered. In this paper, the studies of the chemical
nuclease properties encoded by the metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
were extended by using different types of
single chain nucleic acids, i.e, ribosomal and tumor mosaic virus RNAs as well as poly-dA-dT. Our results
showed that degradation of the nucleic acids occurred only under reductive conditions. Although MPA and
[3-mercaptoethanol were the chemical reducers that best assisted the nuclease reaction, other biological
compounds such as citric and succinic acid also were shown to act like reducers in that reaction. All.hough
the nuclease activity of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
was comparable to that exhibited by bis copper phenanthroline
[Cu(phen)z]2+our results showed that none of the individual components of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
was able to
promote the degradation of either the RNAs or poly(dA-dT). These results strongly support the hypothesis
that the metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)] uses not only DNA but also RNA as targets to promote bacterial
killing.

INTRODUCTION
lntracellular metals strongly influence the activity of quinolones due to dramatic effects on their
physicochemical properties /1/. To investigate how the transition metals exert their action on biological
systems, the coordinative behavior of quinolone drugs in complexes of the type [Cu(phen)(antib)]+
(where
antib is a quinolone or fluoroquinolone) has been explored/2,3/. This approach has allowed altering not only
the potency but also the specificity ofquinolones/4,5/.
The metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
(where hal is nalidixate; Fig. 1) was previously used as a model to
investigate how this type of compound affects bacterial viability/4, 5, 6/. Our results demonstrated that this
compound not only possessed the ability of interacting with DNA in vivo but also was shown to encode a
potent chemical nuclease which under reductive conditions promoted the degradation of plasmid and
chromosomal DNA/6/.
Whether [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
uses only DNA as its intracellular target remained to be investigated, due to the
fact that in addition to degrading bacterial genomic DNA, [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
also exhibited the ability to attack
ribosomal RNA /6/. The relevance of this observation regarding the bacterial intracellular targets of this
compound prompted us to characterize its nuclease activity during the degradation of single stranded nucleic
acids.
We report here the characterization of the chemical nuclease activity of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
using as
substrates two types of single chain nucleic acids, i.e, ribosomal and tumor mosaic virus RNAs as well as
poly (dA-dT).
The results obtained here support the hypothesis that the metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
exerts its
activity against bacteria not only through the interference with DNA metabolic processes but also by
promoting the degradation of other nucleic acids like messenger and ribosomal RNAs.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Synthesis of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
Synthesis and purification of the metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)(HzO)]NO3"3H)_O (Fig. l) was carried out
as previously described /2, 3/. Copper phenantroline [Cu(phen)2]2+
was prepared in solution by mixing
equimolar amounts of copper(II) nitrate and phenanthroline previously dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water
to a final concentration of mM.
Reagents and Enzymes
All the chemicals used were of analytical grade. The chemical compounds 1,10-phenanthroline, copper
nitrate and nalidixic acid were obtained from Merck, J.T. Baker and Sigma Chemical Co., respectively.

Physical Damage of Nucleic Acids by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
Experiments to characterize the nuclease activity of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+were carried out with three different
type of substrates, i.e, bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA), tobacco mosaic virus RNA (TMV RNA) and poly
(dA-dT). rRNA was isolated from stationary cultures of the strain Escherichia coli DH5cz following the
protocol of alkaline lysis /7/. The 6350 bases-long tobacco mosaic virus RNA and poly (dA-dT) were
purchased from Boehringer Manheim. A typical reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 25 lal,
nucleic acid, 250 rig; [Cu(phen)(nal)]+, different concentrations; and mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), 7 mM.
The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37C and then diluted 1:6 with loading buffer, which
contained 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer, pH 8, mM EDTA, 12% (v/v) glycerol, and bromophenol blue as a
tracking dye, and loaded on a 1% agarose gel containing 40 mM tris-acetate buffer, pH 8.0, mM EDTA
(TAE), and 0.04 mM ethidium bromide. The gel was run in the same buffer at 90 volts. The nucleic acids on
the gel were observed and photographed using an Eagle Eye gel documentation system (Stratagene, USA).

RESULTS
Previous studies showed that [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
possessed activity of double stranded nuclease [6]. To
investigate whether [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
is able to promote the degradation of other type of nucleic acids, the
metal, complex was first incubated in vitro with different concentrations of rRNA isolated from E. coli. The
results shown in Figure 2 demonstrated that the metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
at a final concentration of
320 laM, was incapable per se ofpromoting the degradation or inducing any other apparent physical effect on
the structure of the rRNA (Fig. 2, Lane 1). However, upon addition of MPA, the metal complex was able to
promote the degradation of this type of nucleic acid; such a reaction was concentration dependent and
reached a maximum at 80 laM (Fig. 2, Lanes 4-10). The kinetics of degradation of rRNA by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
was also determined. The results depicted in Figure 3 demonstrate that the ribonuclease reaction was very
fast, reaching a maximum after the 5 rain of incubation; no further degradation occurred even after 60 rain of
incubation.
In order to investigate which are the structural requirements of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
to promote the
degradation of rRNA, each of the components of the metal complex at a final concentration of 40 laM was
incubated with rRNA in the presence or absence of MPA. As shown in Figure 4, none ofthe components was
capable of degrading the rRNA, but [Cu(phen)2]2+
which caused a level of degradation similar t:o that
exhibited by[Cu(phen)(nal)]+
(Fig. 4, Lanes 4 and 6).
To gain further insight into the chemical nuclease specificity of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+, TMV RNA was used as
substrate. The TMV RNA, a 6350-nucleotide single stranded molecule encoding a poly-cistronic messenger
RNA was shown to be a substrate for the nuclease activity encoded by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+. As observed for
rRNA, the metal complex alone possessed no activity against TMV RNA. However in the presence of MPA,
the metal complex promoted the degradation of this type of nucleic acid; as shown in Figure 4 the maximum
levels of degradation occurred at a final concentration of 40 laM. Although MPA alone was shown to have a
low nuclease activity against this type of RNA (Fig. 5, Lane2), the level of degradation was much lower than

in the presence of the reducing agent MPA. As observed during degradation of TMV RNA, MPA alone also
was shown to possess activity against poly (dA-dT) (Fig. 6, Lane 2); however, the reaction was much
stronger in the presence of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+, reaching a maximum level at a concentration of 40 laM (Fig. 5,
lanes 4-10).
Using as a substrate plasmid DNA, our previous results demonstrated that [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
encoded a
more powerful chemical nuclease than [Cu(phen)2]2+
/6/. Therefore, in this work the potency of both
compounds during degradation of rRNA was also compared. We analyzed this reaction as a function of the
concentration of the metal complexes. The results shown in Figure 7 demonstrate that no substantial
difference exist between both complexes to promote the degradation of rRNA. In both cases the reaction
reached a maximum at a final concentration of 80 laM and was strictly dependent on the presence ofthe thiol
compound MPA.

The reactions were carried out for 60 min at 37 C and then analyzed in a 1% agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide.
As mentioned above, chemical nucleases such as [Cu(phen)2]2+
induce the degradation of double-stranded
DNA in an oxygen-dependent reaction, but only in the presence of a reducing agent such as
mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)/8, 9/. The nuclease activity of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
against both double stranded
DNA/6/and single stranded nucleic acids (this work) has also been shown to be dependent on the presence
of MPA. To investigate whether other reducing agents, in addition to MPA, could assist the IRNAse activity
of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+, the following compounds were tested: succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric, thiolactic acid,
as well as 13-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol (DTT). Results seen in Figure 8 showed that when these
compounds were included into the mixture reaction at the same final concentration, (i.e., 7 raM), MPA and 13-

DISCUSSION
The ability of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
to interact/n vivo with bacterial DNA and to promote its degradation/n
vitro has been widely substantiated by our previous studies/6/. In addition to degrading bacterial genomic
DNA, [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
also exhibited the ability to attack ribosomal RNA/6/. The implication of this result
regarding the bacterial intracellular targets ofthis compound prompted us to characterize its nuclease activity
during the degradation of single stranded nucleic acids.
As previously reported during the studies of the nuclease activity of [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
against plasmid and
chromosomal DNA/6/, the metal complex alone was incapable of promoting the degradation or inducing any
other apparent physical effect on the structure of either of the single-stranded nucleic acids tested here. This
result demonstrates that the compound does not possess nuclease activity per se; however, upon addition of
the reducing agent MPA, a strong nuclease activity against the three substrates was unmasked. This behavior
has been observed not only for [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
but also for [Cu(phen)2]z+/10/and other metal complexes
whose nuclease activity is triggered by a reducing agent in the presence of molecular oxygen or hydrogen
peroxide/10, 11, 12/.

Experiments with different reducing agents showed that in addition to MPA other strong reducing agents,
such as beta-mercaptoethanol and thiolactic acid, were also able to support fully the RNAse reaction
promoted by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
(Fig. 8). Although to a lesser extent, succinic and citric acid also promoted the
RNAse reaction ofthe metal complex. However, the low power exerted by these biological compounds could
have important implications concerning the possible intracellular effects of this compound during its
interference with bacterial viability.
Degradation of the three type of nucleic acids tested here was not only dependent on the concentration
used, but also on the whole structure of the complex. These results are relevant due to the fact that
experimental evidence from physiological studies has demonstrated that the whole compound is also required
to induce the maximum levels of the SO; response in B. subtilis /6/ and to interfere maximally with the
growth ofsome bacterial species/4, 5/.
[Cu(phen)(nal)]+
was shown to possess a stronger nuclease activity than [Cu(phen)2]2+
during degradation
of double-stranded DNA/6/. In the present work, we observed no difference between the potency of both
metal complexes to degrade either rRNA (Fig. 7), or TMV RNA and poly (dA-dT) (Results not shown).
Although at present we have no explanation for these results, it is possible that the different potencies
exhibited by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
to degrade double or single stranded nucleic acids could be influenced by the
secondary or tertiary structure (or both) adopted by these nucleic acids.
Previous reports demonstrated that [Cu(phen)2]2+
is also capable of cleaving the phosphodiester backbone
of RNA/9, 13/. Interestingly, in the RNA cleavage reaction it was observed that single-stranded regions were
much more susceptible to scission than double-stranded stem structures/11/. Other chemical nucleases with
RNAse activity have been reported, for instance, methyl propidium-EDTA /14/, ferrous-EDTA /15/, and
light-activated uranyl acetate /18/. An interesting aspect regarding the mode of action of these last two
complexes is that they seem to cut RNA in a primary and secondary structure-independent manner.
[Cu(phen)(nal)]+
behaves like these compounds as equally promoting the degradation of mRNA and rRNA.
Therefore this compound could have a potential application as a footprinting reagent to study the interactions
between proteins and DNA as well as with RNA.
The results shown here demonstrate that under reducing conditions, the metal, complex [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
is able to induce the degradation of two forms of RNA, i.e., ribosomal and messenger RNA. Although the
mechanism of cleavage of RNA by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
is a matter that deserves to be further investigated, the
implications of these results are very important in terms of the possible bacterial intracellular targets used by
this compound to promote bacterial killing. Degradation of rRNA could have a dramatic effect on protein
synthesis; a similar effect, with no less dramatic consequences, could be the degradation of messenger RNAs.
On the other hand the nuclease activity exerted by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
against poly (dA-dT) could be
physiologically relevant, for instance during the establishment of the complex RNA polymerase-open
promoter where zones of single stranded DNA are exposed and potentially could be substrates for the attack
of the metal complex [Cu(phen)(nal)]+. This prediction is not unprecedented, as Spessky and Sigman/17/
reported that [Cu(phen)2]2+
shows a preference to attack the template strand during the establishment of the
open promoter lac UV-5 com',.ex with E. coli RNA polymerase lacUV-5 /17/. Foot printing reactions
revealed that [Cu(phen)]+ preferentially attacks the positions-6 to -4 upstream ofthe transcription start site;
such sites were shown to be within a single stranded region formed at the active site of RNA polymerase.

Thus, taking into account the results obtained here together with previous studies which demonstrated
that [Cu(phen)(nal)]+
interacts with DNA, putatively affecting essential DNA functions such as replication
and transcription/6/, we conclude that other nucleic acids such as rRNA and mRNA could be .potential
intracellular targets during the bacterial killing promoted by [Cu(phen)(nal)]+.
