ABSTRACT
The synthesis, characterization and the biological study of a series of Ni(ll)2(carboxylato)2 [12-
MCNi(ii)N(shJ)E(pko)E-4][12-MCNi(ii)N(sh03(pko)-4] (CH3OH)3(H20) fused 12-membered metallacrowns with 10
metal ions and commercial available herbicides or anti-inflammatory drugs as carboxylato ligands are
reported. All the compounds have a mixed ligand composition with salicylhydroxamic acid and di-2-pyridyl-
ketonoxime as chelate agents. The compounds construct metallacrown cores {[12-MCNi(n)N(sj02(pko)2-4][12-

and 1 charge,
respectively. Each metallacrown unit has four ring Ni(II) ions and one additional encapsulated Ni(II) ion in
planar arrangement. The anionic unit is bonded with cationic one creating binuclear moieties. The herbicide
or antiiflammatory carboxylato ligands are bridging the central octahedral nickel atom with a ring metal ion
in a bindetate fashion. The effect on DNA and their antibacterial activity was examined. The changes in the
mobility can be attributed to the altered structures ofthe pDNA treated with Ni(II) complexes. Evaluating the
data of the antibacterial activity of the compounds tested, we can conclude that nickel complexes present
strong antibacterial activity.
Key words: metallacrown, nickel, antibacterial activity.
INTRODUCTION
Metallomacrocycles have gained increasing attention over the past decade due to their potentially unique
properties. Metallacrowns are an example ofthis molecular class that exhibit selective recognition of cations
and anions, can display intramolecular magnetic exchange interactions and may be used as building blocks
for chiral layered solids/1/. Structurally, metallacrowns* resemble crown ethers in their repeating pattern of
O-X-X-O with the oxygen atoms oriented toward the center of a cavity/2-27/. [9-MCoN0g,nd)-3] /2-4/,

dimers and fused metallacrowns /11,17,24,25/ have been reported.
Nickel compounds are speculated to be carcinogenic/28/both in humans and experimental animals/29-
33/. Because of the chemical nature of nickel, it is expected to form covalent bonds with DNA at several
available binding sites such as nitrogen and oxygen centers of nucleobases and phosphate oxygens. Covalent
Ni2+
coordination to the N7 atom of guanine and adenine has been reported/34/and this covalent interaction
can be considered responsible for base depurination, predominantly at the adenine sites, resulting in extensive
DNA damage/35/. Recent evidence suggests that DNA repair systems are very sensitive targets for Ni(II),
resulting in a reduced removal of damaged DNA caused by environmental agents, which in turn may increase
the risk oftumor formation.
We have initiated studies on the co-ordination chemistry of herbicide and/or anti-inflammatory
carboxylate agents with Cu(II), Mn(II) and d ions in an attempt to examine their mode of binding and their
* Metallacrown Nomenclature. The nomenclature for metallacrowns is as follows: M'mAa[X-MCuox)az)-Y],
where X and Y indicate ring size and number of oxygen donor atoms respectively, MC specifies a
metallacrown, M and ox are the ring metal and its oxidation state, H is the identity of the remaining
heteroatom bridge, and (Z) is an abbreviation for the organic ligand containing the N/O functionality. There
are m captured metals (M') and a bridging anions (A) bound to the ring oxygens and metals, respectively.

Aldrich Co. All chemicals and solvents were reagent grade. Agarose was purchased from BRL. Tryptone and
yeast extract were purchased from Oxoid (Unipath LTD, Hampshire, UK). Molecular weight markers, 1Kb
DNA ladder, was from Gibco BRL. Plasmid pUC19 or pTZ18R was isolated from E. coliXL1.
Culture media"
MMS (Minimal Medium Salts broth): 1.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (w/v) NH4CI, 0.5% (w/v) K2HPO4, 0.1%
(w/v) NaCI, 0.01% (w/v) MgSO4 7H20 and 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract.
Luria Broth Medium: 1% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) NaC1 and 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract. The pH of the
media was adjusted to 7.0.
Methods
Infrared spectra (200-4000 cm1) were recorded on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR 1650 spectrometer with samples
prepared as KBr pellets. UV/VIS spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu-160A dual beam and on a Perkin-
Elmer Lambda 9 UV/vis/near-IR spectrophotometer equipped with a Perkin-Elmer 3600 data station. 1H
NMR spectra of the complexes were obtained on a Bruker 200 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer operating in the
quadrature detection mode (H frequency, 200.1 MHz). Between 2000 and 5000 transients were accumulated
over a 75 kHz bandwidth for each sample. The spectra contained 8000 data points, and the signal to noise
ratio was improved by apodization of the free induction decay, which introduced a negligible 20 Hz line
broadening. Baseline corrections of the NMR spectra were accomplished by a spline fir of baseline points
chosen to minimize alteration of the peak line shape, position, and resolution. Chemical shifts were
referenced to resonances due to residual protons present in the deuterated solvents. FAB mass spectra were
acquired by the University of Michigan Mass Spectroscopy Facility. C, H and N elemental analysis were
performed on a Perkin-Elmer 240B elemental analyser. Ni was determined by atomic absorption
spectroscopy on a Perkin-Elmer l00B spectrophotometer. Electric conductance measurements were carried
out with a WTW model LF 530 conductivity outfit and a type C cell, which had a cell constant of 0.996. This
represents a mean value calibrated at 25C with potassium chloride. All temperatures were controlled with an
accuracy of + 0.1 C using a Haake thermoelectric circulating system. All plastics and glassware used in the
experiments with nucleic acids were autoclaved for 30 min at 120C and 130 KPa. Heat-resistant solutions
were similarly treated, while heat-sensitive reagents were sterilized by filter.
Plasmid isolation:
Plasmids pUCI9 and pTZ18R were isolated from E. coli XL1 by the alkaline SDS lysis method
(Strategene). Native DNA was isolated from calf thymus gland using standard procedure. Linear DNA
resulted from incubation of the plasmid with the restriction enzyme EcoRl. Single stranded (ss) DNA was
prepared by heating double stranded (ds) DNA at 100 C for 10 minutes.

Agarose gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids:
Aliquots of 1-3 ag of each nucleic acid (as indicated in the legends) were incubated in the presence of
compounds 1-6 in a final volume of20 lal. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at a constant temperature of
37 C. It was terminated by the addition of 5 tl loading buffer consisting of 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25%
xylene cyanol FF and 30% glycerol in water. The products resulting from DNA-compound interactions were
separated by electrophoresis on agarose gels (1%), which contained lag/ml ethidium bromide in 40 mM
Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 20 mM sodium acetate, 2 mM Na2EDTA at 5 V/cm. Agarose gel electrophoresis was
performed with a horizontal gel apparatus (Mini-SubTM
DNA Cell, BioRad) for around 4 h. Since ethidium
bromide forms a fluorescent complex when it binds to DNA, a decreased of fluorescence signifies diminution
ofthe amount ofDNA. The gels were visualized in the presence of UV light. All assays were duplicated..
Antibacterial activity"
The antibacterial activity of the compounds was studied against B. substilis (wild type), B. cereus (wild
type), S. aureus (wild type), E. coli (XL1), P. mirabilis (wild type) and X. campestris (ATCC 33013). The
screening was performed by the method of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Two different media
(LB and MMS) were used. The compounds were dissolved in distilled water with a 2-fold successive serial
dilution from 100 to 12 tg.ml1. All cultures were incubated at 37C, except X. campestris, which was
cultivated at 28 C. Control tests with no active ingredients were also performed.
Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (M.I.C.):
Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (M.I.C.) is determined using the method of progressive double dilution
in liquid media containing 100 to pg/ml of the compound being tested. A preculture of bacteria was grown
in LB overnight at the optimal temperature of each species. 2ml of MMS were inoculated with 20tl of this
preculture. This culture was used as control to examine if the growth of the bacteria tested is normal. In a
similar second culture 201 of the bacteria as well as the concentration of the compound tested was added. A
third sample containing 2ml MMS supplemented with the same concentration of the compound tested was
used as a second control to check the effect of the compound on MMS. All samples were in duplicate. We
monitored the bacterial growth by measuring the turbidity of the culture in the tubes after 12 and 24 h. If a
certain concentration of a compound inhibits bacterial growth we check the effect of the compound at the
half concentration. This procedure continues until a concentration in which bacteria grow normally. The
latest concentration that inhibits of bacterial growth is the M.I.C. value. All equipment and culture media are
sterilized.
Preparation of the Complexes:
The metallacrown compounds 2, 3, 4 with 2,4,5-T, MCPA, and 2,4-D as accommodated ligands
respectively, were prepared according to the procedures reported previously/11,17,24/.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The synthesis of the nickel metallacrowns has been achieved via the reaction of NiClz6H20 with the
deprotonated salicylhydroxamic acid and ketonoximic acid followed by the addition of the sodium salt of the
phenoxyalkanoic acid or anti-inflammatory carboxylic acids, in methanol e.g
10 NiCI2 6H20 + 5 Hashi + 3 Hpko +18 NaOH +2NaL
[NIL]2[12-MCyi0)y(sl,0z(pko)2-4][12-MCNi0)N(sh)a(pko)-4](MeOH)a(H20) + 18H20 + 20NaCl
The compounds are red-brown crystalline solid that appear to be air and moisture stable and insoluble in
water. All metallacrowns are soluble in methanol, CHCI3, DMF, DMSO and there are no electrolytes in these
solvents.

Structural features of the metallacrowns
A series of mixed ligand compounds with unique characteristics have been obtained using 2-dipyridyl.-
ketonoxime in conjunction with salicylhydroxamic acid. Hpko is a bifunctional ligand that can bind metals in
either five or six membered chelate rings (scheme 2). The ligand can be singly deprotonated when metals are
bound. The deprotonated di-2-pyridyl-ketonoxime uses ketonoxime oxygen (OK) and one pyridine-nitrogen
(N) to bind to one nickel and the other pyridine-nitrogen (N) plus ketonoxime nitrogen (NK) to chelate an
adjacent Ni(II). The deprotonated salicylhydroxamic acid acts as a binucleating ligand with the carbonyl and
hydroxamate oxygens (Oc and Ou) binding to one nickel and the phenolate oxygen (Oph) plus imine nitrogen
(N) chelating an adjacent Ni(II).

2:2 distribution of shi and pko results in a trinuclear Ni3(shi)z(Hpko)2(py)2 compound/44/ or in a
tetranuclear [12-MCNi(Ii)Y(Hs/,02(pko)2-4] metallacrown ring [11]. When Ni(ll) is captured in the center, the
divalent pentanuclear [Ni(II)(A)2][ 12-MC Ni(U)N(.,0q,o)2-4] [A=carboxylato ligand] complex results/11/.
The stoichiometry of shi
-and pko
-3:1 leads to the formation of a decanuclear metallacrown complex
with the formula [Ni(II)(A)]2[12-MCNi(H)N6.,02(pko)2-4][12-MCNi(I)N(s,03(pko)-4]. This neutral decanuclear
[Ni(ll)(A)]2[12-MCNi(n)y6./,02(pko)2-4][12-MCNi(n)N(s/,03(pko)-4 fused metailacrown consists of (wo [12-

with +
and 1 charge, respectively (Figure 1). Each metallacrown unit has four ring Ni(II) ions and one
additional encapsulated Ni(II) ion in planar arrangement. The anionic unit is bonded with cationic one
creating binuclear moieties (Figure 2a). The {Ni(II)(A)[12-MCNi0)N(,,02(po)2-4]} cation with 1+ charge has an
alternating pattern of shi and pko ligands as one cycles around the 12-MC-4 structure (Figure la). Three
Ni(II) ions have octahedral configuration and the fourth one a square planar. The {Ni(II)(A)[12-
MCNio)Ns,O3q,ko)'4]} anion with three shi3-
and one pko ligands forms an anionic metallacrown ring with 1
overall charge (Figure b). The two metallacrown cores are formed through a [Ni(II)-N-O-]4 repeat unit.
Three Ni(II) ions are in octahedral and one in square planar environment analogous to the cationic unit. The
cavity radii, 0.68 A and 0.70 A, for the anionic and cationic units of compound 3/1 1,17/respectively, allows
encapsulation of the fifth nickel ion. (Figure 2b). The captured Ni(II) ion lies in the plane of the four ring-
oxygen atoms. The herbicide or antiiflammatory carboxylato ligands are bridging the central octahedral
nickel atom with a ring metal ion in a bindetate fashion (Figure 2b).

Spectroscopic study
All the metallacrowns show strong bands about 1600, 1480, 1465 and 1265 cm" assigned to v(C=N)sh.pko,
v(C=Oph).h, v(C=Oox).,.h and v (N-Oox)sm,pko stretching frequencies respectively, while the presence of
Vasym(CO2) and Vsym(CO2) bands at about 1570 and 1440 em" with A 130 em" support a double-bridging
mode of binding of the carboxylato ligands. The IR patterns of all the metallaerowns are very similar
suggesting structural similarities. The solution paramagnetie H NMR spectra of the metallacrowns with.
ibuprofen and naproxen as accommodated ligands, compounds 5 and 6, show six distinct downfield
resonances in a range from 40 to 10 ppm. The downfield pattern is similar for all the metallacrowns allowing
these resonances to be attributed to the protons of the metallaerown rings. In Sehiff-base Ni(lI)-complexes,
the protons were found to be downfield shifted with the-CH=N group to be the most paramagnetically
shifted signal, at about 300 ppm/45,46/; that is not the case for our compounds as most of the protons are
quite apart from the paramagnetic centers. One would expect up to twelve resonances for the metallacrown
part of the complexes, eight from pko and four from shi and 4-8 resonances from the bound carboxylato
ligands. A complete assignment of resonances was not accomplished because selective deuteration ofthe pko
and earboxylato ligands is an arduous task. FAB Mass Spectroscopy was used to determine the molecular
weight of the species in solution. Almost all the compounds give a molecular weight fragment at FAB-MS
(e.g. compound 6, Figure 3) suggesting that the compounds keep their integrity in solution.

In vitro effects of nickel compounds on DNA
The effect of the newly synthesized complexes of Ni(II) with high metal nuclearity, on the integrity and
electrophoretic mobility of nucleic acids was examined. Figure 4 shows that compounds 1, 2, 4 and 5 (lanes
1, 2, 4 and 5, respectively), at concentration 1.2 mM affect the electrophoretic mobility of supercoiled and
relaxed pDNA, whereas compounds 3, 6 do not show any effect. The effect of compound 1 becomes more
profound in the experiment of Figure 5, where increasing concentrations of the compound 1 were used.
Retardation in the electrophoretic mobility of supercoiled and relaxed pDNA occurred or precipitates in the
top of the gel at higher concentrations of compound 1. The changes on the mobility can be attributed to the
altered structures of the pDNA treated with Ni(lI) complexes. Compound 1 was effective even at the
concentration of 0.4 mM. The effect of ligands or the solvent (DMSO) on the pDNA mobility was tested as

well, with no remarkable effect. Similar results with the compound 1 were observed when linearized plasmid
DNA, ds or ssDNA were used (data not shown).
Antibacterial study of nickel compounds
The results of antibacterial screening data, for the nickel compounds tested, on B. subtilis, B. cereus, S.
aureus (Gram positive), and X. campestris, E. coli, P. mirabilis (Gram negative), are shown in Table 1.
Among all the compounds tested, the most active was compound 1. The best M.I.C value (12 tg/ml) was
presented by compound 1, with the most sensitive microorganism the B. subtilis. The effect of all substitutes
was tested separately on all cultures without causing any growth effect.
Evaluating the above data by comparing the antibacterial activity of the compounds tested and. the effect
on DNA we can conclude that complexes that exhibit antibacterial activity were those that caused alterations
on DNA. However, a correlation between DNA interference and antibacterial properties of the new
compounds must be further elucidated.
