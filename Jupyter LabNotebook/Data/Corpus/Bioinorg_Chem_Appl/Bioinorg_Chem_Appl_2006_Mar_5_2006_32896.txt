INTRODUCTION
Present-day anticancer agents are facing challenges such as side
effects, toxicity, targeting, drug delivery, acquired
resistance, and cancer specificity. To overcome such problems,
drugs with different molecular level action are required, and a
variety of such species are under way to address
these problems [–]. The interaction of drugs at the target site
involves the DNA helix which is a sequence of bases (thymine,
adenine, guanine, and cytosine). The correct conformation of the DNA
helix is maintained only when adenine is paired with thymine and
guanine with cytosine. A large number of articles appearing in the
literature describe the interaction of metal ions with nucleic
acids, giving the mechanism of action of metal-based
chemotherapeutic agents that target DNA [–].

Developing new rational designer antitumor drugs on similar mechanisms of cisplatin, which target the cellular DNA and exhibit chemical similarity of N7 binding site in guanine and
adenine, is a most challenging area in the pharmaceutical industry.
In a recent article, Lippard et al studied the theoretical
binding of cisplatin to purine bases; a dominating preference for
initial attack at N7-position of guanine in comparison
with adenine has been established []. On the basis of ΔG‡, the activation free energy values for guanine = 24.6 kcal/mol and adenine 30.2 kcal/mol, it was
predicted that guanine is 3-4 orders of magnitude more
reactive towards cisplatin than adenine.

Boron compounds have received considerable attention as
biologically important molecules, since boron is an essential
element and is involved in nucleic acid synthesis linked to
pyrimidine nucleotides []. They may be utilized to probe
fundamental biochemical events at the molecular level as well as
in providing entirely new classes of compounds of potential
medicinal value. Based upon four-coordinate boron, they generally
possess sufficient hydrolytic and oxidative stability to be used
in biological studies [,
]. The development of boron
compounds for the treatment of cancer by boron neutron capture
therapy (BNCT) is very significant. The closer the proximity of boron
compound to tumor cell nucleus, the greater its radiobiological
effect []. Many researchers are studying boron-containing
molecules as potential delivery agents for cancer chemotherapy
[].

Boron compounds in combination with tin(IV) metal cation (hard
Lewis acid), which exhibits strong affinity to the dinegative
phosphate groups of DNA [] (supportive evidence for this
coordination exists both in solution [] and in solid
state [] and tin compounds are reported to be effective
against some types of cancers, such as P-338 leukemia [,
]),
have further advantage of exhibiting therapeutic success by
healing the damaged cells.

Herein, we describe the kinetics and electrochemical behavior of
the representative complex (5) towards guanine, adenine, and calf
thymus DNA to understand the mechanistic pathway of binding to
cellular targets. These studies were carried out using UV-Vis
spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry mainly 1. The binding ability
of the complex is multifold due to the presence of these metal ions
which selectively bind to the target site viz copper. A transition
metal ion prefers to bind to N7 of guanine or adenine to a
lesser extent of the nucleotide bases, while tin(IV) cation binds to
the phosphate group of the DNA backbone [], and boron atom provides possible
cellular entrapment and retention properties in proliferating
tumor cells [].

EXPERIMENTAL
Materials and methods
All the reagents 2-aminobenzothiazol (Farak berlin, Germany),
salicylaldehyde, KBH4 (Lancaster), Calf thymus DNA, guanine,
adenine (Sigma), (CH3)2SnCl2 (Fluka),
CuCl2 · 2H2O, and
ZnCl2 (anhydrous) (Merck) were used without
further purification. Microanalyses were performed by a Carlo Erba
Analyzer Model 1108. Molar conductance was determined at room
temperature by a Digisun electronic conductivity bridge. IR
spectra (Nujol mull) (200−4000 cm−1) were recorded
on a Shimadzu 8201 PC spectrophotometer. 1H and
13C NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker DRX-300
spectrometer. Mass spectra were obtained on a Jeol SX-102 (FAB)
spectrometer. EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E112
spectrometer at X-band frequency (9.1 GHz) at liquid
nitrogen temperature (LNT).

Cyclic voltammetry was carried out at CH instrument
electrochemical analyzer. High purity H2O and DMSO
(95 : 5) was employed for the cyclic voltammetric studies with
0.4 M KNO3 as a supporting electrolyte. A three electrode
configuration was used comprising of a Pt disk working electrode,
Pt wire counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as reference
electrode. Kinetic studies were carried out with a Cintra 5 UV-Vis
spectrometer attached to an online data analyzer on which
absorption spectra were evaluated. All experiments involving the
interaction of the complex (5) with guanine, adenine, and calf
thymus DNA were conducted in buffer (9.2 pH), doubly distilled
water, and Tris buffer (7.5 pH), respectively. The progress of the
reaction was monitored by measuring absorbance changes at
269 nm (λmax of complex (5) + guanine),
260 nm (λmax of adenine), and 260 nm
(λmax of CT-DNA), respectively. Pseudo-first-order
rate constants, kobs, were determined by linear least
squares regression method.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION
The reaction of Schiff base (1) with KBH4 in 2 : 1 ratio
yielded dihydro OO′ bis (salicylidene) 2,2′ aminobenzothiazolyl
borate (2), which was utilized as a ligand for complexation with
CuCl2 (3), ZnCl2 (4), and subsequent complexation
of (3) and (4) with dimethyltindichloride yielded the bimetallic
borate complexes (5) and (6), respectively.

All the complexes are air stable and are soluble in DMF, DMSO and
are covalent in nature. The analytical data of the complexes
conform to the structures proposed in .

IR spectra
The IR spectrum of the ligand shows prominent stretching
vibration at 2372–2400 cm−1 region due to
ν(B−H). The BH stretch generally appears as a single
peak in the regions 2400–2500 cm−1, but the presence
of both 10B and 11B in natural boron results
in the splitting of bands [, ]. Other characteristic
frequencies due to the presence of the ligand appear at
1595 cm−1, 1449 cm−1, and 752 cm−1
assigned to ν(C=N), ν(C−N), and
ν(C−S) vibrations, respectively
[–]. The
formation of borate is authenticated by the appearance of
ν(B−O) band at 1391 cm−1 [, ], which
is further confirmed by absence of ν(O−H) stretching
vibration at 3422 cm−1 which was present in the Schiff
base []. The ν(B−O) band, however, shifts to
higher frequencies (28 cm−1) in the complexes indicating
the participation of oxygen of borate in the formation of
complexes.

In the far IR spectra of the monometallic complexes, sharp
absorption bands appearing at 390–402 cm−1,
311–320 cm−1 are assigned to ν(M−O) and
ν(M−Cl) vibration, respectively [, ]. The
bimetallic complexes show absorption bands at 420–428, 546–549,
and 460–462 cm−1 assigned to ν(Sn−N),
ν(Sn−C), and ν(Sn−Cl), respectively,
confirming the coordination of tin(IV) center to azomethine
nitrogen and chlorine atoms [, ].

Electronic absorption spectra
The electronic absorption spectra of the borate ligand and
complexes reveal three strong bands in 40 000–25 000 cm−1
region which are attributed to intraligand and charge transfer transitions.

The complex (3) exhibits a broad and low energy band at
16 528 cm−1 which is attributed to d-d transition
(2B1g →2A1g), typical for
CuII in square planar environment. The absorption
spectrum of the (5) complex exhibits two MLCT bands at
34 013 cm−1 and 30 303 cm−1 and a
broad band at  17 361 cm−1 attributed to d-d transition
which is typical for copper(II) complex in square planar geometry [].
Although there is a shift in the d-d absorption band of the (5)
complex in comparison to the absorption band observed for the (3)
complex which is attributed to the presence of Sn(IV) metal
ion, the environment around the copper center does not alter much,
it retains square planar geometry.

EPR studies
The solid state X-band EPR spectrum of the Cu(II)
complex recorded at LNT (77 K) was found to be anisotropic with
only two peaks with “g” values g⊥ = 2.037,
g∥ = 2.195, and gav = 2.089, respectively.
The parameter gav was obtained
according to the equation [(gav) = 1/3 (g∥ + 2g⊥)] and is in
good agreement with corresponding anisotropy in square planar
environment. The existence of g∥ &gt; g⊥ suggested that the
unpaired electron is localized in dx2−y2 orbital
of the CuII ion with “3d9” configuration, that
is, (eg)4, (a1g)2
(b2g)2 (b1g)1, which is the
characteristic of the square planar geometry [].

The g values are related to the axial symmetry parameter G by
the Hathaway [, ] expression
G = (g∥ − 2)/(g⊥ − 2).
According to Hathaway, if the value of G is greater than four, the
exchange interaction is negligible, whereas when the value of G is
less than four, a considerable exchange interaction is indicated
in the complex. In the complex (5), the G value obtained was 5.27
which indicates that exchange interactions are absent.

NMR studies
1H NMR spectra are particularly useful to confirm the
formation of borate ligand. The absence of phenolic −OH
resonance peak at 10.12 ppm in the ligand clearly indicates
the formation of borate by the removal of hydrogen gas [] and
the presence of BH2 signal at 0.72 ppm []. The
other signals due to N=CH proton and aromatic ring
proton appear at 7.99-7.97 and 7.55-6.52 ppm,
respectively. In the complexes (4) and (6), there is a slight
upfield shift in BH2 signal due to the presence of metal ions in
the proximity of BH2 protons. A new signal appears in the
complex (6) at 1.21 ppm due to methyl protons of the
dimethyltin moiety.

13C NMR spectra of ligand have been recorded in DMSO and
carbon resonance signals appears at 129-124, 165, 153, and 114 ppm
assigned to aromatic phenyl ring carbons, HC=N,
C−S, and C−N groups, respectively. Upon
complexation, there is a slight shift in aromatic ring carbon
resonance due to the coordination of metal to the oxygen atom of
phenyl ring. Furthermore, complex (6) registers a new signal at
39.8 ppm attributed to −Sn−CH3 carbons due to
which CH=N carbon resonance gets altered slightly, this
is also an indication of coordination of azomethine nitrogen to
the diorganotindichloride. Other carbon signals remain unaltered
in the complexes.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical behavior of the complex (5) has been examined
by cyclic voltammetry to study the metallointeraction. The cyclic
voltammogram of the complex (5) in absence of guanine, adenine, and
calf thymus DNA was recorded in DMSO/H2O (5 : 95) at a
scan rate of 0.1 Vs−1 in the potential range −1.2 to
1.6 V versus Ag/AgCl electrode. It exhibits a well-defined
quasireversible redox wave CuII/CuI attributed to one
electron transfer process with Ep value at −0.615 V and
−0.519 V (, curve a). For this couple,
the difference between the cathodic and anodic peak potentials
ΔEp is of the order 96 mV, a somewhat large peak to
peak separations in comparison to Nernstian value (59 mV)
observed for one electron transfer couple. Large peak width for
one electron couple CuII→ CuI is fairly
common observation and is due to the reorganization of the
coordination sphere during the electron transfer process
[, ]. The ratio of anodic to cathodic peak currents
Ipa/Ipc is less then the unity (0.3). The
criteria for reversibility of the process is satisfied as on
increasing the scan rate; the voltammogram does not show any
significant change, and current is proportional to V1/2
[].

The electrochemical behavior of the complex (5) in the presence of the
guanine, adenine, and calf thymus DNA in DMSO/buffer,
DMSO/H2O, and DMSO/Tris buffer (5 : 95), respectively, are
presented in .

The CV trace of the complex (5) in the presence of guanine shows a
dramatic change in electrode potential Ep values, while the
cathodic peak potential shifts to −0.669 V (in comparison to
solution without guanine Ep = − 0.615 V), a positive shift of
−0.054 V is observed. However, the anodic peak disappear
completely (, curve b) indicative of strong
binding of the complex to guanine base.

The cyclic voltammogram of the complex (5) in the presence of adenine
shows a slight shift in formal potential values (in comparison to
the solution in absence of adenine) (, curve
c). Although it corresponds fairly well with quasireversible one
electron redox couple, peak potential does not show any
significant change (0.002 and 0.003 V). The CV trace of
adenine bound complex clearly suggests that the binding of the complex
(5) to adenine is possible but the degree of binding is much lower
in comparison to guanine.

However, the cyclic voltammogram of the complex (5) in the presence of
calf thymus DNA (, curve d) shows a
significant shift in electrode potential value; cathodic and
anodic peak potentials both shift to positive values
−0.642 V and −0.561 V, while for the solution of the
complex (5) in the absence of calf thymus DNA, electrode potential
values are −0.615, −0.561 V as depicted in
, curve a, indicating that both the copper(II)
and copper(I) forms interact with the calf thymus DNA to the same
extent and suggest strong binding with calf thymus DNA [].
Employing a square redox scheme, the net shift in E1/2 has
been estimated from the ratio of equilibrium constants for the
binding of CuII and CuI complexes to calf thymus
DNA using the following equation:



 where E1/2 and E1/2′ are formal potentials of the
Cu(II)/Cu(I) couple in the free and bound forms,
respectively. The ratios of binding constants of K2+ and
K1+ were corresponding to binding constants for the
Cu(II)/Cu(I) species to DNA, respectively []. The
ratio of binding constants of 1+ and 2+ species was less than
1 (0.670 for calf thymus DNA), which provides an evidence for the
preferential stabilization of Cu(II) species.

Kinetic studies
The interaction of the complex (5) with guanine, adenine, and calf
thymus DNA in DMSO/buffer, DMSO/H2O, and DMSO/Tris buffer
(5 : 95) was studied spectrophotometrically at 25°C
under pseudo-first-order conditions.

The electronic absorption spectrum of free guanine exhibits two
characteristic bands at 244 nm and 273 nm. On addition of
the complex (5), the UV band at 273 nm increased in
intensity and shifted to 269 nm (a shift of 4 nm is
observed), as shown in . The binding of guanine
with the complex (5) results in blue shift and increase in
intensity which is attributed to “hyperchromism.” Hyperchromism
was due to the breakage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds when
bound to DNA and is consistent with many earlier reports for
copper complexes [, ].

Kinetics of guanine binding to the complex (5) was studied at
269 nm (λmax of the complex (5) + guanine) under
pseudo-first-order condition keeping the concentration of complex
constant (c = 1 × 10−3 M) and varying the concentration
of guanine (c = 10 − 16 × 10−3 M) at different time
intervals (). The rate constants kobs were determined by the linear least squares regression method. An
exponential log(Aα − A0) of absorbance against time
plots gave a straight line indicative of pseudo-first-order
reaction upto 80% completion of the reaction ().

The electronic absorption spectrum of adenine shows a
characteristic UV band at 260 nm. On addition of the complex
(5), there is no significant shift in wavelength and a slight
increase in absorbance. Although a slight hyperchromism is
observed, but the degree of hyperchromism is insignificant in
comparison to the binding of guanine to the complex (5), which
shows relatively weak interaction with adenine base.

Kinetics of adenine binding to the complex (5) was carried out at
260 nm (λmax of complex (5) + adenine) under
pseudo-first-order conditions.  shows time
scan plot of interaction of adenine with complex (5) depicting a
small change in absorbance intensity. The rate constant
kobs values were plotted by linear least squares regression
method ().

The interaction of the complex (5) with calf thymus DNA was
carried out to obtain detailed information concerning the
magnitude of the kinetic influence from the DNA environment as a
function of position of guanine N7 within calf thymus DNA.

The interaction of the complex (5) to the calf thymus DNA was
carried out at 260 nm (λmax of calf thymus DNA)
under pseudo-first-order conditions (). On
addition of the complex (5) to the calf thymus DNA, absorption
spectra reveal a sharp change in absorption intensity with a red
shift of 3 nm. At different time intervals, the absorption
maxima increases in intensity indicating “hyperchromic effect”
with calf thymus DNA.

The kinetics is further studied by observed pseudo-first-order
rate constants kobs value, as they can be directly compared
and used as a measure of the kinetic influence from surrounding
DNA []. The
observed rate constant 1.77 s−1 for guanine
bound  complex is of large magnitude in comparison to
kobs 1.52 s−1 value for calf thymus DNA bound
complex. The rate constant for adenine bound complex is
0.94 s−1, which is much slow in comparison to guanine and
calf thymus DNA. The complex shows preference for guanine over
adenine due to two effects. When adenine binds, only a weak
hydrogen bond is formed between the chloride ligand of the complex and
H2N−C6 group of adenine; secondly, a significantly
stronger molecular orbital interaction is identified in guanine in
comparison to adenine. The presence of the electron withdrawing
oxo group at the C6 position of the purine ring lowers the
energy of the lone-pair orbital at N7 of purine base. The
guanine molecular orbital has an energy of −6.877 eV,
whereas −6.675 eV is obtained for adenine []. These
studies have been demonstrated in a recent article of interaction
of cisplatin with purine bases by Lippard et al []. Our
investigations show that the complex
C32H34N4S2O3BCuSn2Cl5 is strongly bound to calf
thymus DNA via different modes. Cu(II) prefers to bind
strongly to N7 of guanine base while the SnIV
atom binds to the phosphate group []. Moreover, the
affinity of SnIV with dinegative phosphate group is very
strong due to its hard Lewis acidic nature. The binding to guanine
is also kinetically preferred and supported by large kobs
value (1.77 s−1) for guanine bound complex.

Thus in conclusion, the complex (5) may first bind with phosphate
group of calf thymus DNA, neutralize the negative charge of calf
thymus DNA phosphate group, and cause contraction and conformation
change of calf thymus DNA which is clearly evidenced by the
„overall” hyperchromic effect observed in the absorption spectra.
