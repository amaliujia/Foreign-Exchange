1. INTRODUCTION
2-Mercaptopyrimidine
nucleotides have been detected in Escherichia
Coli sRNA and yeast tRNA; it has been found that they inhibit the synthesis
of tRNA, thus acting as antitumour and antithyroid agents []. A similar
inhibitory effect has been observed for pyrimidine-2-thione (I in ) and its derivatives,
which also show pronounced in vitro bacteriostatic activity []. Metal
complexes of pyrimidine-2-thione or its pyrimidine-2-thiol tautomeric form 
[, ] and its amino [, ] or hydroxy [–] derivatives have been prepared and
studied (for representative ligands see ). Such complexes exhibit rich
structural chemistry, and interesting thermal, magnetic, sorptive, and
biological properties. However, the coordination chemistry of ligands based on
the 2-mercaptopyrimidine moiety and containing both hydroxy and amino substituents on the pyrimidine ring is
completely unkown.

We now describe here the preparation and characterization of the first metal complexes of
4,6-diamino-5-hydroxy-2-mercaptopyrimidine (LH, ). We also report the
antimicrobial activity of the free ligand and four representative complexes
against two bacteria and two fungi. This work can be considered as a
continuation of our interest on the coordination chemistry of derivatized
pyrimidines [].

2. EXPERIMENTS
All reagents
were purchased from Merck and Alfa/Aesar. Na2[IrCl6] is
commercially available. [PdCl2(phen)] was prepared by the reaction
of K2[PdCl4] and 1,10-phenanthroline in H2O/EtOH. 
[ReOCl3(PPh3)2] was synthesized  as previously reported []. DMSO used in
conductivity measurements was dried over molecular sieves. The DMSO-d6 protons (NMR) were referenced using TMS. Warning: perchlorate salts are potentially explosive; such compounds should be used in
small quantities and treated with utmost care at all times. Elemental analyses
(C, H, N, S) were performed by the University of Ioannina (Greece) Microanalytical Unit with
an EA 1108 Carlo-Erba analyzer. The water content of the complexes was also
confirmed by TG/DTG measurements performed on a Shimadzu Thermogravimetric
Analyzer TGA-50. IR spectra were recorded on a Matson 5000 FT-IR spectrometer
with samples prepared as KBr pellets. Far-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
IFS 113 v FT spectrometer with samples prepared as polyethylene pellets. FT
Raman data were collected on a Bruker IFS 66 v interferometer with an FRA 106
Raman module, a CW Nd: YAG laser source, and a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ge
detector. Solution electronic spectra were recorded using a Unicam UV2−100 spectrophotometer. Solid-state (diffuse reflectance, DRS) electronic spectra in
the 300–800 nm range were
recorded on a Varian Cary 3 spectrometer equipped with an integration sphere. 1H
NMR studies were performed on a Varian Gemini WM-200 spectrometer. 31P{1H}
NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Mercury equipment [ref. 85%  H3PO4 (ext.)]. Mass spectra were recorded on a Matson 5988 MS spectrometer. Conductivity
measurements were carried out at room temperature on a YSI, model 32
conductivity bridge using 10−3 M solutions. Room temperature
magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed using a Johnson Matthey
magnetic balance standardized with HgCo(NCS)4; diamagnetic
corrections were estimated using Pascal's constants.

2.2. Antimicrobial activity
The bacterial
strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) were grown in Nutrient
agar slants and the fungal strains (A. niger  
 and C. albicans) were grown in Sabouraud
dextrose agar slants. The viable bacterial cells were swabbed onto Nutrient
agar plates, while the fungal spores onto Sabouraud dextrose agar plates. The
free ligand and complexes 1, 4, 7 were dissolved in DMSO, while complex 8 was dissolved in H2O with 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg/mL concentrations. The
blank was DMSO in saline buffer. The bacterial and fungal plates were incubated
for 36 and 72 hours, respectively, and the activity of the compounds was
estimated by measuring the diameter of the inhibition zone (the affected zone
by the compounds) around the respective zone (the normal place in the agar). 
The incubation temperature was 27 ± 0.5°C.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Synthetic comments and physical
characterization
The preparative
reactions for selected complexes can be represented by the stoichiometric
equations ()–(); no attempts
were made to optimize the yields,

The metal is reduced (RuIII → RuII,   IrIV → IrIII) during the preparation of complexes 3 and 5 although the
reactions are performed in air. The redox reaction may be facilitated by the
reducing character of LH, the products from the oxidation of the ligand
remaining in the solution. Thus, LH possibly plays two roles in the reactions, that
is, the role of the ligand and that of the reducing agent. It is well known
that Ru(III) can undergo reduction reactions and that the [IrIVCl6]2− ion is a convenient one-electron oxidant []. The use of a base (KOH) in the
preparation of 8 is necessary to
obtain the complex in pure form; otherwise, the produced aqueous HCl decomposes
the compound.

Complexes 1–5, 7 and 10 are nonelectrolytes in DMSO
[]. Complexes 7 and 10 exhibit slightly increased molar
conductivity values in DMSO. Since DMSO is a good donor solvent, this may be
due to the partial displacement of one L− ligand by two DMSO
molecules. Assuming an equilibrium between the neutral and the resulting
cationic complex, this displacement changes the electrolyte type of the
compound explaining the increased ΛM value [].  From the molar
conductivities in DMSO (complexes 6 and 9) and DMF (complex 8), it is concluded that compounds 6, 8, and 9 behave as 1 : 1 electrolytes, supporting their ionic formulation
[]. All the complexes are diamagnetic, as expected []. It should be
mentioned at this point that the π
bonding in the {ReV = O}3+ unit of 9 causes sufficient splitting of the t2g (in Oh)
set (5dxz,   5dyz ≫ 5dxy) that diamagnetism
occurs through the configuration (5dxy)2.

Complexes 1–10 are microcrystalline or powder-like,
stable in the normal laboratory atmosphere, and soluble only in DMF and DMSO. 
We had hoped to structurally characterized one or two complexes by
single-crystal X-ray crystallography (working mainly with DMF or DMF/MeCN), but
were thwarted on numerous occasions by twinning problems or lack of single
crystals. Thus, the characterization of the complexes is based on spectroscopic
methods.

3.2. Electronic spectra
The band at 335 nm in the DRS spectrum of 1 is
assigned to an O2− → MoVI p–d LMCT transition and is
characteristic of the {MoO2}2+ moiety [] in octahedral
complexes. The transition appears at 337 nm as a shoulder in solution (DMSO). 
The DRS spectrum of 3 is indicative of its low-spin octahedral structure. The ground term
is 1A1g and the two spin-allowed
transitions to 1T1g and 1T2g are observed at 565 and 420 nm, respectively []; the
corresponding bands in DMSO are at 560 and 430 nm. The DRS spectra of the
Rh(III) complexes 4 and 6 both exhibit bands at ~470 and ~380 nm; the spectra resemble those of other six-coordinate Rh(III) compounds and
the bands are assigned as transitions from the 1A1g ground state to the 1T1g and 1T2g upper states
in octahedral symmetry in decreasing order of wavelength []. The lower
wavelength band may also have a charge-transfer character. Both complexes
exhibit an additional band in the blue region of the spectrum (~520 nm) which
is responsible for their red-brown colors; a possible origin of this band is
the singlet-triplet, spin-forbidden transition 1A1g → 3T2g []. The spectrum of the Ir(III) complex 5 shows two bands at 380 and 335 nm, which
have a similar interpretation; the 1A1g → 3T2g transition is not observed. A weak shoulder in the spectrum
of 9 is assigned to the 3T1g(F) → 3T2g transition in a d2 octahedral environment, while
an intense band at 375 nm most probably has an LMCT origin []. The
ligand-field spectra of 7 and 8 are typical of a square planar
environment around pd II with a mixed N,O-ligation; the bands at 480,
375, and 330 nm are assigned [] to the 1A1g → 1A2g, 1A1g → 1Eg,  and 1A1g → 1B1g transitions, respectively, under D4h symmetry. 
The spectra in DMSO exhibit only two bands at 480 and 330 nm.

3.3. NMR studies
Diagnostic 1H
NMR assignments (in DMSO-d6) for representative complexes are
presented in . The study was based on comparison with the data obtained
for diamagnetic complexes with similar ligands [, , ]. In all the spectra
studied, the integration ratio of the signals is consistent with the
assignments.

The spectrum of LH exhibits two singlets at δ 6.07 and 6.18 assigned to the –N(4)H2/–N(6)H2 (for the numbering scheme see ) amino hydrogens, respectively, and two
relatively broad singlets at δ
7.43 and 9.13 due to the amide and hydroxyl protons –N(1)H– and –O(5)H,
respectively. The appearance of these four peaks is consistent with the
exclusive presence of the thione form of LH () in solution. The proton
of the hydroxyl group is not observed in the spectra of the complexes confirming
its deprotonation and coordination to the metal ions. In the spectra of 1, 3, 4, and 6–8, the –N(1)H– signal
undergoes a marginal shift to indicate the noninvolvement of this group in
coordination; a relatively large downfield shift would be expected if
coordination had occurred. In the same spectra, two signals appear for –NH2 protons, as expected. The most pronounced variation in chemical shift is the
downfield shift of one signal. Since more specific assignments of these two
signals seem impossible, it is difficult to conclude which amino nitrogen is coordinated. 
NMR evidence for the presence of thione –thiol tautomerism
in the metal complexes in solution was not found.

The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 confirms that the three N,O-bidentate (vide
infra) ligands are equivalent (C3 symmetry), and, therefore, the complex has the fac stereochemistry [].

The spectrum of 8 is
indicative of the presence of one solution species containing coordinated phen,
consisting of four resonances []. Assignments are as follows (the numbers in
parentheses are the positions of the protons in the classical numbering scheme
of 1,10-phenanthroline; s = singlet, dd=doublet of doublets): 9.15 dd(2H; 2,9),
8.53 dd(2H; 4,7), 8.00s(2H; 5,6), and 7.81q(2H; 3,8). Considerable downfield
coordination shifts, Δδ(Hl)[Δδ(Hl) = δ(Hl)complex − δ(Hl)free  phen], are observed for all resonances, their values being 0.16, 0.27,
0.31, and 0.19 for the protons of the positions (2,9), (4,7), (5,6), and (3,8),
respectively. These shifts are characteristic of coordinated phen [].

The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum of the Re(V) complex 9 in DMSO-d6 consists of a
sharp singlet at δ − 16.89, a
value which is typical for PPh3-containing oxorhenium(V) species
[].

3.4. Vibrational spectra
Tentative assignments
of selected IR ligand bands for complexes 1–10 and free LH are listed in . 
The assignments have been given by studying literature reports [, , ],
comparing the spectrum of LH with the spectra of the complexes and by
performing deuterium isotopic substitution experiments in few cases. As a
general remark, we must emphasize that some stretching and deformation modes
are coupled, so that the proposed assignments should be regarded as approximate
descriptions of the vibrations.

In the v(OH)water region, the
spectra of complexes 1–3 show one medium-intensity band at
~3420 cm−1 attributed to the presence of coordinated water []. The
same spectra exhibit, in addition to the relatively sharp band of coordinated
water, a weaker broad continuous absorption covering the 3400–3200 cm−1 region; this is apparently due to the simultaneous presence of crystal and
coordinated water in these complexes []. In the spectra of 4–8, a medium broad absorption indicates
the presence of exclusively crystal (lattice) water.

The absence of an IR or Raman band at ~2600 cm−1 in the
spectrum of free LH suggests that the ligand exists in its thione form (see
) []. This is corroborated by the appearance of the medium v(C=S)
band at 1177 cm−1 (this vibration appears as a strong peak at 1160 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum) and the strong IR v(N–H) band at
2970 cm−1 (this vibration appears as a medium peak at ~3000 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum); the broadness and low frequency of the latter IR band
are both indicative of the involvement of the –NH– group in
strong hydrogen bonding.

The medium IR
band at 3305 cm−1 in the spectrum of free LH is assigned to the v(OH)
vibration. This band does not appear in the spectra of the complexes indicating
deprotonation of the –OH group and
suggesting coordination of the resulting, negatively charged oxygen atom. The
absence of large systematic shifts of the δ(N–H), δ(NH), v(C=N), v(C2– N1)/v(C2– N3),
and v (C=S) bands in the spectra of the complexes implies that there
is no interaction between the ring nitrogen atoms or the exocyclic sulfur atom
and the metal ions. The vas(NH2) and vs(NH2)
bands are doubled in the spectra of the complexes. One band for each mode
appears at almost the same wavenumber compared with the corresponding band in
the spectrum of free LH, whereas the other band of each pair is significantly
shifted to lower wavenumbers. This fact is a strong evidence for the presence
of one coordinated and one “free” (i.e.,
uncoordinated) amino group per L− in the complexes [].

The presence of coordinated PPh3 groups in 6 and 9 is
manifested  by the strong IR bands at
~1100 and ~750 cm−1, attributed to the v(P–C) and δ(CCH)
vibrations, respectively []; the former band overlaps with the ClO4− stetching vibration in the spectrum of the Rh(III) complex 6. In the spectrum of 8,
the bands at 1627, 1591, 1510, 1485, and 1423 cm−1 are due to the
phen stretching vibrations []; these bands are at higher wavenumbers compared
with the free phen indicating chelation. The bands at 854, 841, 743, and 725 cm−1 are assigned to the γ(CH) vibrations of the coordinated
phen [].

The vibrational spectra of the inorganic “parts” of complexes 1, 2, 6, 9, and 10 are also
diagnostic. The IR spectrum of 6 exhibits a strong band at ~1100 and a medium band at 624 cm−1 due to
the v3(F2)
and v4(F2)
modes of the uncoordinated TdClO4− ion [], respectively, the former having also v(P–C)
character []. In the 1000–750 cm−1 region, the spectra of 1 and 2 show bands characteristic of the cis-MO22+ units
and the {O2M–O–MO2}2+ core (M=Mo, W) [, ]. 
The IR bands at 930 and 912 cm−1 in 1 are assigned to the vs(MoO2)
and vas(MoO2)
modes, respectively [, ]; the corresponding Raman bands appear at 910 and
896 cm−1. As expected [], the symmetric mode is weak in the IR
spectrum and strong in the Raman spectrum, while the opposite applies for the
asymmetric mode. The appearance of two stretching bands is indicative of the cis configuration []. The strong IR
band at 745 cm−1 is assigned to the  
vas(Mo–O–Mo)
mode [], indicating the presence of a μ-O2− group. The vs(WO2), vas(WO2),
and vas(W–O–W) bands appear at 945, 922, and 755 cm−1,
respectively, in the IR spectrum of complex 2 [, ]; the vs(WO2)
and vas(WO2) Raman bands are at 940 and 917 cm−1,
respectively. The vs(WO2)
and vas(WO2)
modes are at higher wavenumbers when compared to those of the analogous Mo(VI)
complex 1, suggesting [] that the cis-WO22+ group
has some “triple” bond character []. In the spectra of 9, the band attributed to ν (Re=O)
appears at 956 (IR) and 968 (Raman) cm−1 [, ]. The IR spectrum
of the uranyl complex 10 exhibits
only one U=O stretching band, that is, vas(UO2), at 940 cm−1 (not
observed in the Raman spectrum) indicating its linear transdioxo configuration []. The vs(UO2)
mode appears as a strong Raman peak at 905 cm−1, and, as expected,
the corresponding IR band is very weak. The bands at 345 and 298 cm−1 in the far-IR spectrum of 7 are
assigned to the v(Pd–NH2) and v(Pd-O)
vibrations, respectively. The
appearance of one band for each mode (B3u and B2u under D2h) is consistent with a trans structure [].
				

3.5. Antimicrobial activity studies
The free ligand
LH and its complexes 1, 4, 7, and 8 were assayed in vitro
for antimicrobial activity against two bacterial (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) and two fungal (A. niger  
 and C. albicans) cultures. The hot plate diffusion method was adopted
for the activity measurements []. Results are listed in Tables  and .

In general, the Pd(II) complexes 7 and 8 were found to have higher
efficacy than 1, 4, and LH at the measured concentrations. The water-soluble complex 8 is the most active against the
pathogens studied. It is remarkable that the antifungal activity of 8 is comparable with, or even better
than, the activity of the antifungal drug nystatin, and this may be due to the
simultaneous presence of phen and L− in the complex. The activity of
the Pd(II) complexes 7 and 8 is tentatively attributed to their
inhibition of the DNA replication (by interacting with enzyme prosthetic groups
and altering the microbial metabolism) and their ability to form hydrogen bonds
with the cell wall and cell constituents []. The weaker activity of 4 is noteworthy; the reason for this is
not clear.

4. CONCLUSIONS
The M/LH general
reaction system fulfilled its promise as a source of interesting complexes. 
From the overall evidence presented before, it seems that the ligand L− behaves as a bidentate chelate in all the prepared complexes with the deprotonated
oxygen and most probably the amino nitrogen of the position 6 of the pyrimidine
ring being the donor atoms, see . However, the participation of the
amino nitrogen of the position 4 of the ring cannot be ruled out. The
nonparticipation of the sulfur atom in coordination in complexes 7 and 8 may be seen as unusual given the soft character of Pd(II) in the
context of the HSAB concept.

The chelate
effect (a stable chelating ring with the participation of the sulfur atom
cannot be formed due to the geometry of L−) seems to govern the
thermodynamic stability of these complexes. The proposed gross schematic
structures for 1–10 are shown in . Due to the
fact that single-crystal, X-ray crystallographic studies are not available, few
structural features (e.g., the
symmetric structures of 1–3, 6, 7, and 10) are
tentative. The metal ions adopt octahedral (1–6, 9, 10) or square planar (7, 8)
stereochemistries.

Finally,
complexes 1, 4, 7, and 8 are new welcome additions in the growing family of metal
complexes with antimicrobial activity.

The results described in this report represent the initial study of the
coordination chemistry of LH and the biological activity of its complexes. 
Further studies with 3d-metal ions are in progress.
