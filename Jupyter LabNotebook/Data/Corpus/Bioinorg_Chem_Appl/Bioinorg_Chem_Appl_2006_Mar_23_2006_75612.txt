INTRODUCTION
The use of rare earth elements (REE) in agriculture to promote the
growth of plants is well known [–]. The utilization of REE containing fertilizers is widespread in China due to its rich REE resources. They are found to have nitrogen-fixing capacity, to
enhance seed germination, strengthen photosynthetic rate, to enhance respiration and activity of hydrolytic enzymes and plant hormones, and reduce water loss [, ]. Chen et al [] have reported the stimulation in growth of tobacco seedling treated with lanthanide. Enhancement in the germination of lanthanide-treated aged rice seeds has been reported by Fashui [].

Heterocyclic compounds like indole-3-acetic acid and naphthyl-1-acetic acid are the plant auxins found to affect the growth of plants []. Especially benzimidazole-containing heterocyclic moieties have found extensive use in agriculture []. The lanthanide complexes of a few selected compounds have exhibited fungicidal and bactericidal activities including
regulating the growth of plants [–].

It is known that chelation of metal ions with organic ligands acts
synergistically to increase its effect [].

Keeping this in view, the Ln(III) and 
Y(III) complexes of benzimidazole-2-acetic acid 
(HBIA) have been synthesized and characterised. La(III) 
complex of HBIA was used to carry out the germination study. The present experiment 
was conducted with a view to study the following.

Effect of complex on germination, coleoptile, and root length of wheat.

Comparative effect of complex, ligand, salt, and meth-anol on the above-mentioned factors compared to the control.

Lanthanides at high concentration are toxic whereas lower concentrations promote 
plant growth action, called the Hormesis effect [].
Hence wheat seeds were treated with 
10−6 M solution for different treatment periods.

EXPERIMENTAL
Chemicals and instruments
Reagent grade chemicals were used without further purification.
Ethyl cyanoacetate (S. D. Fine Chem Ltd, India) and o-phenylenediamine 
(Koch Light Laboratories Ltd., England) was used. The metal contents of the complexes 
were determined by complexometric titrations against EDTA. Carbon, hydrogen, 
and nitrogen contents were determined by using a Carlo-Erba Strumentazione (Italy) 
CHN analyzer. Molar conductivities in DMSO 
(10−3 M) at room temperature (26°C) 
were measured using an Elico conductivity bridge having platinum electrodes. 
Magnetic moments were determined by a Faraday balance. The IR spectra of ligand 
and its metal complexes were recorded on a Nicolet 170 SX FT-IR spectrometer in the range 
400–4000 cm−1 using KBr discs. The EPR spectrum 
of the Gd(III) complex was recorded on a Varian E-4X band spectrophotometer. 
1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 MHz NMR 
spectrometer using DMSO-d6 as solvent. UV-visible spectra were measured 
on a Hitachi 2001 spectrophotometer using dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as solvent. 
Thermogravimetry (TG) 
and differential thermal analysis (DTA) measurements were made in 
N2 atmosphere between 20 
and 1000°C using a Perkin-Elmer (Pyris Diamond) analyzer. 
Lanthanide nitrates were prepared by dissolving the corresponding oxide 
(99.99%, Indian Rare Earths Ltd, India) in 50% 
HNO3, followed by the evaporation of the excess acid.

Synthesis of ligand
The ligand was synthesized according to literature method 
	[].

(a)Preparation of cyanomethyl benzimidazole
o-phenylenediamine (10 mmol, 10.0 g) and ethylcyanoacetate (15 mmol, 17 g) were placed in the
reaction tube and heated in boiling aniline for 20 minutes. The
residue was broken up and extracted with ether. The residue was
recrystallised from hot water with the aid of norite and finally
from alcohol and water ().

Yield: 11 g (70%),

MP: 209.7–210.7°C.

(b)Alkaline hydrolysis
2-cyanomethyl benzimidazole (10 mmol, 1.57 g) was added to
20 cc of a water solution containing 1.2 g of NaOH and 3 cc of ethanol and refluxed for 2 hours or until no more
ammonia was evolved. The solution was then acidified with acetic acid.

Yield: 1.65 g (95%),

MP: 116°C (with decarboxylation, solidification, and remelting at 
		176°C (2-methyl benzimidazole)).

Synthesis of complexes
The ligand was first converted into its sodium salt by refluxing
NaOH (2 mmol, 0.080 g) and HBIA 
(2 mmol, 0.0352 g) in 
20 ml methanol for half an hour.
Ln(NO3)3 (1 mmol) dissolved in minimum amount 
of methanol was added and further refluxed for 3 hours. The solution was then 
concentrated to a small volume and the precipitate
obtained was filtered, washed with water and ethanol, and air-dried.

Yield: 75%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Procedure
Two local varieties of wheat (DWR-195 and GW-349, developed at
UAS, Dharwad) were selected for the experiment. The solution of
compounds (10−6 M) was prepared in methanol due to 
its insolubility in water. The compounds to be tested consisted of La(BIA) complex, 
HBIA ligand, La(NO3)3, 
methanol, and water (control) 
assigned as groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The periods of treatment varied 
from 2, 5, 8, and 11 minutes assigned as T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively.

The seeds were soaked in the respective solutions for the
above-mentioned time periods and then placed between germination
papers (46 cm × 29 cm in size) previously soaked with 
water in two rows. They were then rolled carefully ensuring no excess pressure was placed
on seeds, wrapped in a sheet of polythene film to reduce surface
evaporation, and placed in a germination chamber. On the fifth day
after germination, the germination count was taken. Ten seedlings
(out of 25 taken) were randomly selected and measured for their
coleoptile and root length. Three replications were carried out
for each observation.

Statistical analysis
The statistical evaluation of the results was conducted with use
of SPSS-(statistical package for social science; Windows version
6.0) packed program. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
to analyze the results. The level of statistical significance was set at 
P &lt; .05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Germination percentage
In case of variety GW-349 (), 
there was no significant difference between all the groups at T1 and T2. In case of T3, 
groups 3 and 4 showed significant decrease in germination percentage (GP) compared to 
the control (P &lt; .05). At T4, group 5 showed significant increase in GP compared to groups 2,
3, and 4. Group 1 showed significant increase in GP compared to groups 3 and 4.

In case of variety DWR-195 (), at T1, T2, 
and T3 there was no significant difference in GP in case of all the groups. At T4, group 1 
seeds showed significant increase in GP compared to group 5(control).

Root length
In case of variety GW-349 (), 
at T1, group 1 showed significant increase in root length (RL) compared to groups 2, 4, and 
5(control). At T2, T3, and T4 there was no significant differences between the groups.

In case of variety DWR-195 (), 
at T1, T2, and T4, group 1 shows significant increase in RL compared to groups 2, 3, 4, and 
5(control), while at T3 group 1 does not show any significant differences between 
the groups.

Shoot length
In case of variety GW-349 (), 
group 1 showed increased shoot lengths (SL) compared to groups 2, 4, and 5 at T1, T2, and 
T3 while group 3 showed significant difference compared to group 1. At T2 and T3, group 1 
showed increased SL compared to group 3. However, at T3 and T4, group 1 showed no 
significant increase in SL compared to control, and compared to group 2 at T4. Group 1 
showed significant increase in SL compared to groups 3 and 4 at T4.

In case of variety DWR-195 (), 
group 1 showed significant increase in SL for the treatment periods T1, T2, T3, and T4 
compared to groups 2, 3, 4, and control. However group 3 showed significant increase in 
SL compared to group 1 at T3 while at T4 there was no significant difference 
between group 1 and control.

General aspects
The complexes are nonhygroscopic, off-white in color, and have 3 : 2
(M : L) stoichiometry (). 
The complexes are almost soluble in methanol, ethanol and completely soluble in DMF 
and DMSO whereas they are insoluble in acetone, chloroform, benzene, and ethyl acetate. 
The molar conductivity values of the complexes in 10−3 M 
DMSO () are in the range 
4.4−9.6 Ohm−1 cm2 
mol−1 indicating their nonelectrolytic nature 
[].

Magnetic moment values indicate the absence of metal-metal interaction 
				and the noninvolvement of 4f electrons in bonding.

Spectral analysis
Infrared
The IR spectral data of HBIA and its Ln(III) complexes is given in 
. In the free ligand, a broad band in
the region 2525–3391 cm−1 is due to intramolecular 
hydrogen bonding between OH of carboxylic group 
and C=N []. The bands at 
1647 cm−1 and 1613 cm−1 
are assigned to the ν(C=O) and ν(C=N) groups, respectively []. 
The −NH stretching frequency is observed at 3164 cm−1. 
An intense band observed at 1567 cm−1 is characteristic 
of 2-substituted benzimidazoles [].

In the complexes, the νNH vibrations appear in the range 3048–3055 cm−1
and has a comparatively lower value compared to that for the free ligand. On complexation, 
the νC=O frequency vanishes and is replaced by two bands
between 1585–1591 cm−1 and 
1431–1442 cm−1 assignable to 
νasy(COO) and νsym(COO),
respectively. In the spectra of sodium salt of the ligand, the 
νasy(COO) and νsym(COO) occur at 1586 and 1441 cm−1, respectively.

In the present complexes, the difference between the ν asym(COO) and νsym(COO) lies in the
range 148–160 cm−1 whereas that of the sodium salt is
145 cm−1 indicating the coordination of carboxylate group
to metal ions in bidentate bridging fashion [, 
]. The ν(C=N) band is shifted to lower frequency merging with the 
νasym(COO) band indicating its
involvement in coordination.

The presence of coordinated nitrate groups is confirmed by the
presence of six fundamental bands at 1313, 1525, 739, 708, 998, and 
850 cm−1 which are assigned to 
ν1, ν4, ν3, ν5, ν2, and ν6, respectively. The difference between the two highest bands ν4 and ν1 lies in the range 206–216 cm−1, 
indicating the coordination of nitrate groups in bidentate or
bidentate chelating fashion [, 
].

A strong and broad absorption between 
				3375–3394 cm−1 in the complexes indicates 
				the presence of water molecules.

1H NMR spectra
The 1H NMR spectra of HBIA and its La(III) complex 
() was carried out in DMSO-d6. 
The proton assignments are given in .

A broad signal at 12.20 ppm in the “free” ligand is ascribed
to −OH of the carboxylic group which is intramolecularly
hydrogen-bonded with the nitrogen of the benzimidazole moiety. Two
quartets at 7.10 and 7.45 ppm is due to four aromatic protons
of the benzene moiety. A broad singlet at 3.5 ppm is due to
NH. A sharp singlet at 2.5 ppm is assignable to two
protons of the −CH2 group which also overlaps with the
DMSO peak.

On complexation, the −OH signal disappears completely
indicating the breakdown of intramolecular hydrogen bonding along
with ligation of COO− to metal ion. The downfield shift of
the −NH signal from 3.5–3.7 ppm indicates the
involvement of ν(C=N) in coordination with the metal ion. The −CH2 proton undergoes a very slight upfield shift to 2.48 ppm. The aromatic protons appear in the region
7.07–7.47 ppm.

UV-visible spectra
The electronic spectra of HBIA displays three absorption bands at
276, 270, and 257 nm which are assigned to the π-π*
 transitions. The electronic spectra of the
complexes are similar to that of ligand except for a very slight
shift towards lower frequency. A comparison of the transitions of
the complexes with their corresponding aquo ions has been made
(). This data clearly indicates that the
energy of f-f transitions in the complexes is slightly reduced
from the corresponding aquo ions, due to perhaps covalent
interaction of 4f orbitals with vacant ligand orbitals or
increased nuclear shielding of f-orbitals due to slight L-M
electron transfer []. The nephelauxetic ratio 
(β), bonding parameter 
(b1/2), Sinha's covalency parameter 
(δ%), and angular covalency (η) for the Pr(III) and Nd(III) complexes have been calculated [–].

The Sinha parameter (δ) is taken as a measure of covalency and is given by 
 where βav is the average value of the ratio of νcomplex/νaquo.

The bonding parameter (b1/2), the magnitude of which suggests the comparative involvement of the 4f orbitals in metal-ligand bonding, is related to the nephelauxetic ratio β and is given by the expression 

δ values are less than one whereas the remaining values are positive 
indicating the interaction between the metal salts and ligand is mainly electrostatic.

EPR spectra
The EPR spectra of the Gd(III) complex
() showed broad resonance peaks with 
g = 1.99 (at RT) and 1.97 (at LNT). Similar g values and line widths (at
both RT and LNT) indicate that line widths are independent of
temperature []. It is observed that fine 
structure, as a consequence of Gd(III) zero-field splitting is lacking. The broad peaks 
obtained indicate that the Gd(III) complex is located in a rather disordered environment. 
Thus the spectrum is
an average overall possible realization of the crystal field,
which can be influenced by distribution of hydrogen bonds. Random
H-bonds between water molecules and complex induce small
distortions, which lead to line broadenings. This phenomenon
called strain, more specifically g-strain for the g-tensor
distribution and D-strain for the ZFS (zero-field splitting)
distribution, leads to broad asymmetric EPR line shapes
[, ].

Thermal analysis
The TG/DTA study of a representative Dy(III) complex () was determined in nitrogen atmosphere up to
1000°C using a heating rate of 10°C/min.

The weight loss of 3.64% on TG curve between 
29–79°C reveals the loss of three-lattice-held water molecules, 
which is in agreement with the calculated values of 3.85%. The next
weight loss of 5.09% between 80–150°C agrees 
(5.14%) with the loss of four coordinated water molecules. A
weight loss corresponds to the loss of a ligand molecule and four
coordinated nitrate molecules (calc: 30.27%), in the temperature
range 280–540°C. Above 500°C 
there is a plateau, which corresponds to the formation of stable
Dy2O3. The metal percentage obtained is 
34.78%, which agrees well with calculated value (34.83%) 
and is within the experimental error.

The tentative structure was arrived at on the basis of the various
spectral studies and is shown in .

CONCLUSION
The results obtained in the present study indicate that in both
the varieties, germination percentage of water-treated
seeds and complex treated seeds was not significantly different at
lower treatment periods of 2, 5, and 8 minutes indicating
germination is not affected by the treatments. In case of
root length the root lengths of complex-treated seeds, at
lower treatment period of 2 minutes, were significantly higher than
the water-treated ones.

In case of shoot length, in both the varieties the
complex-treated seeds showed significant increase in shoot length
compared to the water-treated ones at lower treatment periods of
2, 5, and 8 minutes.

In all the cases, the complex-treated seeds showed significant
increase compared to those treated with ligand and metal salt alone.

From this, it is concluded that the La(NO3)3 
			salt or HBIA alone is not effective but the complex acts synergistically
to enhance the effect of the two. In case of period of treatments,
lower treatment period (2 minutes) was found to be most effective
in all the cases.

Hence lanthanide complexes of benzimidazoles and other auxins may
prove to be very good plant growth promoters.
