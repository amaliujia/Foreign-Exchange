1. Introduction
As Pt(II) complexes have demonstrated successful clinical application of cisplatin for its anticancer effects, new platinum-based anticancer drugs are highly desired [–]. Up to now, there have been five platinum-based anticancer drugs used in clinical applications, including three FDA-approved platinum compounds: cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, nedaplatin used in Japan, and lobaplatin approved for use in China. In addition, new and nontraditional compounds picoplatin (AMD473) [] and ProLindac [] as well as platinum(IV) complexes, such as satraplatin [], tetraplatin, tetrachloro-trans-R, R-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine platinum (IV), and ipropltin (dichlorodihydroxobis(isopropylamine)platinum (IV) [, ], are being evaluated for clinical trials. Nevertheless, their effectiveness is still hindered by clinical problems, such as acquired or intrinsic resistance that limits the spectrum of cancers that can be treated, and high toxicity leading to side effects and limiting the dose that can be registered []. In the past three decades, substantial efforts have been directed to the tactics that can improve cellular accumulation, oral bioavailability, lifetime in blood, and tumor targeting [].

 During the past two decades, water-soluble platinum(II) complexes have been synthesized, which cannot only retain antitumor activity but also be effectively absorbed after oral administration []. The most common approach to prepare these compounds is a structural approach, in which the chloride ligands are replaced by chelating carboxylates, oxalate, and glycolate [–]. Besides, there are many other methods, such as platinum terpyridine complexes with glycosylated acetylide and arylacetylide ligands [], water-soluble macromolecular platinum conjugates [, ], water-soluble porphyrin-Pt(II) conjugates [, ], formation of water-soluble organometallic analogues of oxaliplatin [], or supramolecular nanoencapsulation technique []. However, the water-soluble platinum complexes archived by means of amine ligands instead of ammonia are most intriguing because the carrier ligands provide broad spectrum of antitumor activity []. For instance, water-soluble platinum(II) complexes of diamine chelating ligands bearing amino-acid type substituents [], the carbohydrate-metal complexes, have been proved a potential effective method [–]. But the synthesis of this complex is extremely laborious, which also lacks clinical data. By contrast, shikimic acid (3R,4S,5R-trihydroxy-1-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid, SA), an active ingredient isolated from traditional Chinese medicine Illicium verum Hook. f. grown in Guangxi province of China, has exhibited good water solubility. It is well used as DNA vaccine carrier [] and [99 mTc(CO)3]-labeled bombesin to reduce both hepatic uptake and renal retention [–]. Though Farrell and coauthors have reported shikimic acid complexes of platinum [], diamine coupled shikimic acid complexes of platinum remain unstudied. In this work, we have synthesized a series of platinum complexes (PtLa–eCl2) with diamine coupled shikimic acid ligands La–e (La–e = SA-NH(CH2)nNHCH2CH2NH2; La, n = 2; Lb, n = 3; Lc, n = 4; Ld, n = 5; Le, n = 6) and investigated their cytotoxicity and DNA-binding properties.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials
All chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. All solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification unless otherwise specified. The synthesized Pt(II) complexes as well as the ligands were dissolved in H2O at a concentration of 5.0 mM as stock solutions to prepare the DNA binding studies. Disodium salt of guanosine-5′-monophosphate (5′-GMP) was purchased from Sigma. pUC19 plasmid DNA was purchased from Takara Biotech Co. Ltd., Dalian of China. Cancer cell lines were obtained from Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences of China.

2.2. Instrumentation and Methods

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded by a Bruker AV-500 NMR spectrometer with chemical shift (in ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were performed on a Perkin Elmer Series II CHNS/O 2400 analytical instrument. ESI mass spectra were measured on a Bruker HCT Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometer. The purity of the platinum(II) complexes was performed on Thermo Fisher Scientific Exactive LC-MS Spectrometer. Capillary electrophoresis was recorded on Agilent HP3D High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis. Flow-cytometric analysis was undertaken by using a FACScan fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS).

2.3. Synthesis
The compounds 1a~e, 2a~e, and 3a~e were prepared following the methods reported by Holmes et al. [, ]. The data are in good agreement with the literatures. The compounds 4a~e, 5a~e, 6a~e (La–e), and 7a~e (PtLa–eCl2) were synthesized via modified methods that were reported by Srinivas et al. [–, –] (see ).

Finally, the gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL) for 30 min and visualized on a Bio-Rad gel imaging system.

PI-positive cells were counted with a FACScan fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). The population of cells in each cell-cycle phase was determined using Cell Modi FIT software (Becton Dickinson).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Synthesis and Characterization
The ligands and platinum complexes were prepared following the previous reported methods [–, –]. Prior to synthesizing the shikimic-carboxamide ligands 6a~e, side chains shown in  are required. 3-aminopropanol was N-protected with benzyloxycarbonyl groups, and the alcohol group of the resulting compound (1) was activated with methanesulfonyl chloride and reacted with excess 1,2-diaminoethane. The newly generated amine groups of the triamine derivative 2 were then protected with Boc groups, which produced the differentially protected triamine derivative 3. Selective deblocking the N-Cbz group gave the unstable amine 4, which then reacted selectively with shikimic acid to produce shimiccarboxamide 5. This was converted to shikimic carboxamide ligand 6 by deblocking the N-Boc group, the precursor ligand for the desired platinum complexes (7). The ligands 6a~e (La–e) reacted easily with K2PtCl4 in the dark at room temperature, and gave the corresponding platinum complexes 7a~e (PtLa–eCl2). Complexes PtLa–eCl2 are soluble in water, with solubilities of 40.3, 32.9, 21.7, 17.0, and 12.6 mg/mL at 298 K, respectively. These compounds were characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and ESI-MS spectroscopies.

All ligands comprise three potential nitrogen donor sites (two amines and one amide). Hence, upon reaction with K2PtCl4, the ligands could bind to the metal center in a bidentate manner (two possible isomers: 2 × amine, 1 × amine, and 1 × aimde), or even in a tridentate way. Although the results of elemental analysis of the platinum(II) complexes are supportive of a bidentate binding, it does not indicate which isomer is formed, or whether both are formed. In order to confirm the isomer formed, the capillary electrophoresis, LC-MS, and detailed comparison of 1H, 13C NMR were carried out. As shown in Figure S1, supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/565032 (see ESI†), only a single peak in their capillary electrophoresis plots was observed for PtLbCl2, PtLcCl2, PtLdCl2, and PtLeCl2 complexes, respectively, which indicated that the product (isomer) was pure and unique; furthermore, the purity of the product (isomer) was confirmed by the results of LC-MS spectra analysis (see Figure S2, ESI†). To determine the ligand coordinate mode in the product (isomer), we in detail investigated the NMR difference between the Pt(II) complexes and free ligands. As shown in , the differences of  Δδ(Ha)  between La–e ligands and PtLa–eCl2 complexes are less; however, those of Δδ(Hc) and Δδ(Hf) are very large; accompanying this trend, those of Δδ(Hb); Δδ(Hd), and Δδ(He) are moderate. The large proton chemical shift differences of two amines mainly induced by the bidentate coordinate mode of two amines of the ligands. Due to the coupling interaction, the adjacent proton chemical shifts also generated moderate changes. These observations were further confirmed by 13C NMR shift differences (Δδ) between La–e ligands and PtLa–eCl2 complexes. As shown in , the differences of Δδ(Ca) and Δδ(Cb) between La–e ligands and PtLa–eCl2 complexes are very less, however, those of  Δδ(Cc); Δδ(Hd), and Δδ(Ce) are very large, which could be resulted from the bidentate coordinate mode of two amines of the ligands. It should be pointed out that platinum satellites were observed as shoulders in the 1H NMR spectra of PtLa–eCl2 complexes [–].

Based on the above mentioned, we could conclude that only one isomer of PtLa–eCl2 formed through the bidentate coordinate mode of two amines under the present experimental conditions and their chemical structures were shown .

3.2. Cytotoxic Activity In Vitro
In an in vitro assay, the platinum complexes with diamine coupled shikimic acid ligands are weakly active against BEL7404 cancer cell lines (see , the data for compound 7a (PtLaCl2) is not available due to its low yield) but do not exhibit activity against SGC-7901, SK-OV-3, CNE-2, and HeLa cancer cell lines under the tested concentrations. Therefore, the platinum complexes with diamine coupled shikimic acid ligands display a certain extent selective cytotoxicity. And their corresponding ligands do not exhibit activity. Their activities depend on the carbon linker length, in which the IC50 values increase at longer carbon linker. Though these platinum(II) complexes with shikimic acid-based ligands possess high water solubility, they are less active than cisplatin, Pt-shikimato complexes [], carbohydrate-metal complexes [], and carbohydrate-linked cisplatin analogues []. Such observations should be correlated their low lipophilicity. Recently, lipophilicity has been considered a crucial aspect for the cytotoxicity of platinum complexes [–]. The platinum antitumour agents must enter cells before reaching their main biological target, namely, DNA. Their distribution within the body and, hence, their activity are to a large extent determined by their lipophilicity []. It is believed that the more lipophilic a complex, the higher its cytotoxicity []. Since PtLb–eCl2 complexes attached a high hydrophilic shikimato group which resulted in a low lipophilicity of the whole PtLb–eCl2 complexes. Thus, it is expected that these platinum complexes do not effectively enter the cells and lead to a low activity [–]. 

3.3. DNA Unwinding and Cleavage Studies
Since DNA is the primary target of Pt(II)-based antitumor complexes, the DNA binding behaviors of the PtLa–dCl2 complexes have been studied via agarose gel electrophoresis. 


 and Figure S1 show the results of agarose gel electrophoresis on pUC19 plasmid DNA, in which three forms are present: supercoiled DNA (Form I) as the dominant components, nicked or open circular DNA (Form II), and linear DNA (Form III) bound with ligands and homologous Pt(II) complexes. The complexation of ligands La–d did not produce any change in the migration rate during agarose gel electrophoresis (Lc as the example, Figure S3, ESI†). 

Due to these platinum(II) complexes having similar structure, herein, we just selected four of them as representatives. As shown in , though the presence of PtLaCl2 did not reduce the electrophoretic mobility of supercoiled DNA obviously, the proportion of supercoiled form deccreased obviously upon increasing the concentrations of 100 and 200 μM. While the presence of PtLbCl2, PtLcCl2, and PtLdCl2, especially PtLcCl2, has induced significant reduction of the electrophoretic mobility of supercoiled DNA, all of them had concentration dependence. It seems that all platinum(II) complexes exhibit high binding affinity to DNA, and covalent binding mode of these complexes to DNA is proposed.

3.4. The Interaction with 5′-GMP
As guanine-N7 is the preferable binding site in DNA to bind with platinum-based drugs [], we investigated the reaction of complexes PtLbCl2, PtLcCl2, and PtLdCl2 with 5′-GMP using ESI-MS and 1H NMR spectrometry.

3.4.1. ESI-MS Analysis
Two peaks  m/z  1213.4 and 1192.4 in  are assigned to one negatively charged species [PtLb(5′-GMP)2-4H + Na]− (C32H47N13NaO20P2Pt, calcd. 1213.8) and [PtLb(5′-GMP)2-3H]− (C32H48N13O20P2Pt, calcd. 1191.8), respectively. Peaks  m/z  1227.4 and 1205.4 in  are assigned to Pt-DNA adducts [PtLc(5′-GMP)2-4H + Na]− (C33H49N13NaO20P2Pt, calcd. 1227.8) and [PtLc(5′-GMP)2-3H]− (C33H50N13O20P2Pt, calcd. 1205.9), respectively.  shows peaks  m/z  1241.4 and 1218.4, which are attributed to the species [PtLd(5′GMP)2-4H + Na]− (C34H51N13NaO20P2Pt, calcd. 1241.9) and [PtLd(5′-GMP)2-3H]− (C34H52N13O20P2Pt, calcd. 1219.9), respectively. These results suggested that the three complexes reacted with 5′-GMP by covalent bonding, and two chloro ligands were removed.

3.4.2. 1H NMR Analysis
We took the reaction of compounds 7c (PtLcCl2) with 5′-GMP as an example to confirm the coordinate site of 5′-GMP using 1H NMR spectroscopy. In all cases, the typical characters H8 of 5′-GMP downshift (8.1 ppm for H8 of free 5′-GMP) and the appearance of H8 signals corresponds to platinum adducts (8.5 ppm for H8 of bis-bound and 8.6–8.8 ppm for H8 of monobound 5′-GMP) [–]. Dijt et al. reported that the N7 position indicated the absence of a protonation effect at low pH in the pH-dependent behavior of H8 from the end products [].

In contrast to the individual component, the 1H NMR spectroscopy of the reaction mixture of 5′-GMP and PtLcCl2 showed clear changes after an incubation of 24 h at 37°C (). The assignments for the representative peaks have been listed in . Peaks at 8.65 ppm for H8A and at 8.49 ppm for H8A′ were observed at 24 h and downfield shifted from the H8 signal at 8.11 ppm, which indicates the formation of Pt-GMP mono-bound and bis-bound adducts. Meanwhile, the signal of sugar H1′ at 5.83 ppm partially shifted to 5.78 ppm, and new signals at 6.31 ppm and 6.27 ppm assigned to PtLcCl2 appeared after incubation with 5′-GMP. These changes suggest that both sugar H1′ and alkene proton were shield due to the platination of N7 of 5′-GMP. The upfield shift of sugar H1′ resonance has been observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of cis-[Pt(GMP)2(NH3)2]2− [–]. The results show that PtLcCl2 can bind to 5′-GMP upon the platination of N7 of guanine, consistent with the ESI-MS results mentioned above.

In summary, these water-soluble platinum(II) complexes can bind to DNA and 5′-GMP, and the low cytotoxicity should correlate their low lipophilicity, but the cellular uptake and detailed action mechanism need further investigation in the continuing work.

3.5. S-Phase Cell-Cycle Arrest
To determine whether cellular DNA is a major target of the water-soluble Pt(II) complexes, we studied the cell-cycle profiles of PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 treated cancer cells (because compounds 7a~e have similar structures; here, only select PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 to investigate their cell-cycle profiles). Cell-cycle analysis was performed, and flow cytometry was used to assess the DNA content of cells stained with propidium iodine, which enables us to quantify the total cellular populations in different phases of the cell cycle (G0/G1, S, and G2/M). The flow-cytometric data for the BEL7404 cells treated with PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 were presented in . Upon treating cells with PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 (250 μM) for 72 h, the cell-cycle arrest has enhanced at G2 phase, resulting in concomitant increases in the G2 phase population and decrease in the S phase population. The direct interaction of PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 with DNA has been examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. It was found that PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 are able to alter DNA configuration. Given all these results, DNA may be a crucial cellular target of PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 in inducing its cytotoxicity.

4. Conclusion Remarks
We have synthesized five water-soluble platinum(II) complexes: PtLa–eCl2 (La–e = SA-NH(CH2)nNHCH2CH2NH2, n = 2–6) through the reactions of Pt(II) with TCM active ingredient, shikimic acid, and coupled aliphatic amine with different carbon linkers (NH2(CH2)nNHCH2CH2NH2, n = 2–6). These Pt(II) complexes interact with DNA by covalent binding, which blocks the DNA synthesis and replication thus inducing low cytotoxicity against cells like BEL7404. The low cytotoxicity should correlate with their low lipophilicity. In addition, PtLbCl2, PtLcCl2, and PtLdCl2 could react with 5′-GMP to form monoGMP and bisGMP adducts via hydrolysis. The cell-cycle analysis revealed that PtLbCl2 and PtLcCl2 cause G2-phase cell arrest.
