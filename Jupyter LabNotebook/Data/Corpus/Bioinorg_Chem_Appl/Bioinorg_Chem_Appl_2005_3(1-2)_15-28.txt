ABSTRACT
In an attempt to probe nucleic acid structures, numerous Ru(II) complexes with different ligands have
been synthesized and investigated. In this contribution we focus on the DNA-binding properties of
ruthenium(II) complexes containing asymmetric ligands that have attracted little attention in the past decades.
The influences of the shape and size of the ligand on the binding modes, affinity, enantioselectivities and
photocleavage of the complexes to DNA are described.
Keywords: Ru(II)complexes; DNA; Asymmetric ligands
1. INTRODUCTION
Tremendous interest has been evoked by the interactions of substitution-inert metal complexes with
nucleic acids over the past decade/1-5/. In particular, ruthenium(II) complexes with polypyridine ligands,
due to a combination of easily constructed rigid chiral structures spanning all three spatial dimensions and a
rich photophysical repertoire, have attracted considerable attention. Since pioneering studies by Barton and
co-workers showed that optically active isomers of [Ru(phen)3]2+
bind to DNA with distinctive
characteristics/6/, the binding of ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes to DNA has initiated vigorous interest
and many structural analogues based on the prototype [Ru(phen)3]2/
have been also synthesized and
investigated/1, 7-21/.
However, most of the reported complexes contain symmetric aromatic ligands. Investigations of
ruthenium(II) complexes with asymmetric ligands have attracted little attention, and their vast potential as
DNA-binding reagents remains largely untapped. In fact, molecular shape, among the various factors that
contribute to stabilizing the metal complex on DNA helix, appears to be the most significant. Modification of

the ligand would lead to subtle or substantial changes in the binding modes, location and affinities of the
complexes to DNA, making it possible to explore various valuable conformations- or site-specific DNA
probes and potential chemotherapeutical agents/6,21,22/. In this review we would like to focus attention on
recent progress made in our laboratory regarding the DNA-binding properties of ruthenium(II) complexes
containing asymmetric ligands/23-28/.
2. MONONUCLEAR RU(II) COMPLEXES CONTAINING ASYMMETRIC LIGANDS
2.1. Effect of ligand planarity on the DNA binding affinity
As pointed out previously, modification of the ligand may lead to subtle or substantial changes in the
binding modes, location and affinities of the complexes to DNA/21/. The influence of ligand planarity is
especially obvious in exploring the DNA binding properties of the series of complexes [Ru(bpy)z(ddt)]2+,
[Ru(bpy)2(dta)]2+
and [Ru(bpy)2(dpt)]2//28/.
Addition of CT-DNA produced a different extent of perturbation on the absorption spectra of the three
complexes; the hypochromism in the MLCT band and other data are listed in Table 1. Intrinsic binding
constants Kb of (2.1 + 0.3) 104 (3.7 + 0.3) 104 and (6.3 + 0.4) 104 M were obtained for
[Ru(bpy)2(ddt)]2/, [Ru(bpy)z(dta)]2/
and [Ru(bpy)z(dpt)]2/, respectively. The viscosity of DNA bound to the
three complexes is increased with the increment of the complex concentration (Fig. 1) and has the same trend
as observed in spectroscopic titration experiments. The results suggest that [Ru(bpy)2(dpt)]2/
is the most
efficient intercalator, [Ru(bpy)2(dta)]2/
next, and [Ru(bpy)z(ddt)]2/
the last. In general, a planar extension of
the intercalative ligand would increase the strength of the interaction of the complexes with DNA [2]. As
seen in the crystal structure of complex [Ru(bpy)z(dpt)]2+, the two phenyl rings in ddt are rotated away from
the 1,2,4-triazine ring with large dihedral angles (45.9 and 42.5,respectively) (Fig. 2). The significant
difference in DNA binding affinity of three complexes can be understood as a result of the fact that the dta
and dpt ligands display a more planar conjugate system than that of the ddt ligand.

2.2. Effect of ligand shape on the DNA binding geometry
It is expected that increasing the surface area for intercalative stacking by a complex will lead to a
substantially increased intercalative binding affinity/2/. However, if the increased part is non-planar relative
to the parent ligand, the binding affinity, even the binding mode, may be changed as observed for
[Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2/, [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2/
and [Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2//26/.

Some electronic absorption data of complexes on binding to DNA are summarized in Table 1. When the
amount of DNA is increased, a decrease of 9.4% in the MLCT transitions is found for complex
[Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2+; for two other complexes, [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2/
and [Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2/, the decreases are 22.5 and
28.1%, respectively. The intrinsic binding constants Kb were determined as 2.49 104

and 1.62 105 Ml
for [Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2+
using the
MLCT absorption. The data suggest that the interaction of [Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2+
with DNA is the strongest,
followed by [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2/, and then [Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2/. The EB competitive binding experiment, which is
used to determine the extent of binding between the second molecule and DNA/38,39/, also supports the
above trend. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant K values for [Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2/, [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2/
and
[Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2+
are 4.89, 27.28 and 30.47, respectively.

30.0 (+ 0.1) C (adapted from Ref. [26]).
This trend can be further testified from viscosity measurements (Fig. 3). [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2/
and
[Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2/
increase the viscosity in a similar fashion to the proven DNA intercalator
[Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+, but [Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2/
exerts essentially no effect on DNA viscosity at low binding ratios;
upon further binding of the complex to DNA, the DNA viscosity decreases. This suggests that the three
complexes could bind DNA in two different modes: [Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2+
in partial, non-classical intercalation
mode and [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2+
and [Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2+
in classical intercalation mode. As revealed by the crystal
structures of complexes /25/, in [Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2+
the dppt ligand is somewhat sterically hindered from
planarity and two phenyl rings are rotated away from the 1,2,4-triazine ring with large dihedral angles (37.2
18
Hui Chao, Liang-Nian Ji Bioinorganic Chemistry andApplications
and 48.3,respectively) (Fig. 4), so it does not completely intercalate DNA. The partial intercalation may act
as a "wedge" to pry one side of a base-pair stack apart, as observed for the A-[Ru(phen)3]2+/40,41/, but not
fully separate the stack as required by the classical intercalation mode. This would cause a static bend or kink
in the helix and decrease the viscosity of DNA. On the other hand, for complex [Ru(tpy)(pta)]2+
(Fig. 5) and
[Ru(tpy)(ptp)]2/
(Fig. 6), the two rotated phenyl rings are replaced with a naphthyl ring or a biphenyl ring in
pta or ptp ligand, respectively. It is nearly coplanar with 1,2,4-triazine ring and constructs a larger
framework compared to that of dppt. This helps two complexes intercalating into the DNA base pairs deeply
and increases DNA viscosity.
Fig. 4: An ORTEP drawing of [Ru(tpy)(dppt)]2/
(adapted from Ref. [25]).
Similar cases are also observed in [Ru(tpy)(PHBI)]z/
and [Ru(tpy)(PHNI)]2+/27/. The results from optical
experiments (Table 1) together with the viscosity measurements (Fig. 7) support that [Ru(tpy)(PHBI)]2+
binds to DNA via electrostatic interaction, while [Ru(tpy)(PHNI)]2/
binds to DNA by partial intercalation via
the extended naphthyl ring into the base pairs of DNA. Although the extended aromatic n-systems in PHBI
and PHNI are comparable to those in dppt, pta and ptp, the DNA binding properties of [Ru(tpy)(PHBI)]2/
and [Ru(tpy)(PHNI)]2+
are different from those of the three complexes discussed above. The great difference
in DNA binding mode and binding affinity is attributed to the molecular configuration of complexes. In
2+
[Ru(tpy)(PHBI)]2+
and [Ru(tpy)(PHNI)] tpy and PHBI (or PHNI) sterically compact each other, and
complexes with them have relatively shielded surfaces, as seen in [Ru(bpy)3]2+
and [Ru(phen)3]2+. The steric
shielding prevents the complexes from intercalating into (or deeply into) the DNA base stack and leads to
their low binding affinities.

Ref. [27]).
2.3. Enantioselective binding to DNA
Equilibrium dialysis experiments may offer the opportunity to examine the enantioselectivity of the
complex binding to DNA. According to the proposed binding model [6[, the A enantiomer of the complex, a
right-handed propeller-like structure, will display a greater affinity than the A enantiomer with the right-
handed CT-DNA helix, due to the appropriate steric matching.
The CD spectra in the UV region of [Ru(bpy)z(dta)]2+
and [Ru(bpy)z(dpt)]2/
after their racemic solutions
were dialysed against CT-DNA are shown in Fig. 8. The dialysate of [Ru(bpy)2(dta)]2/
and [Ru(bpy)(dpt)]2/
show strong CD signals of A enantiomer with a positive peak at 269 and 270 nm, and a negative peak at 287
and 290 rim, respectively. However, the CD spectra for the dialysate of [Ru(bpy)z(ddt)]2/
show no discernible
signals. This is related to the difference in the DNA binding affinity of the complexes and also indirectly
reflects the influence of ligand shape.
2.4. DNA photocleavage studing
The octahedral transition metal complex is stable to the oxidant, but sensitive to light. Upon irradiation,
they can cleavage DNA by generating singlet oxygen, or subtracting the hydrogen atom. Some ruthenium(II)
complexes have been found to promote the cleavage of DNA [14,15,31-35].

concentration of the complexes, [Ru(bpy)2dta]2+
and [Ru(bpy)2dpt]2+
caused single-strand nicking with the
conversion of form to form II; the latter complex even induced the double-strand scissions in supercoiled
DNA; on the other hand, in the presence of [Ru(bpy)2ddt]2+, no distinct cleavage of pBR 322 DNA is
observed. While DNA photocleavage by [Ru(phen)3]2/
has been reported to involve an 102-based mechanism
/29/, the natures of the reactive intermediates as well as the mechanisms of their actions involved in the DNA
photocleavage by these Ru(II) complexes containing asymmetric ligands have not yet been explored in detail.
However, the different DNA-nicking efficiencies of these complexes may be related to the absorption
intensity at 365 nm and the affinity for DNA.

3. DINUCLEAR RU(II) COMPLEXES BRIDGED BY AN ASYMMETRIC LIGAND
Although considerable attention has been mainly devoted to mononuclear ruthenium(II) DNA
intercalators over the last decade, there is growing interest in the interaction of dinuclear Ru(II) complexes
with DNA /42-51/. For example, Kelly and co-workers have reported that by tethering relatively weak
binding systems such as [Ru(bpy)3]2/
into bimetallic systems, binding affinities may be enhanced by several
orders of magnitude/41/. Norden and colleagues have reported that non-intercalating bimetallic complexes,
in which Ru(II) centers are linked by a semi-rigid dppz dimmer, bind with extremely high affinities/45/.
Later they synthesized a bis-intercalating system, where [Ru(phen)2dppz]2+
is tethered together via the dppz
moieties and an aliphatic diamide linker/47/. With the aim of developing novel DNA-binding reagents, we
investigated the DNA binding properties of [Ru(bpy)2(pztp)]2/
and [(bpy)2Ru(pztp)Ru(bpy)2]4//23/.
The absorption spectrum of [Ru(bpy)z(pztp)]2+
showed a perturbation on addition of CT-DNA, with
hypochromism of about 12% in MLCT band. However, upon coordination of another RuI
center in the
bridging ligand pztp, the hyperchromism.of the MLCT band for [(bpy)2Ru(pztp)Ru(bpy)2]4/
decreased by
5%, which is only slightly larger than that of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. For further clarification of the interaction between
the two complexes with DNA, viscosity measurements were carried out. The effects of [Ru(bpy)2(pztp)]2/,
[(bpy)2Ru(pztp)Ru(bpy)2]4/
and [Ru(bpy)3]2+
on the viscosity of rod-like DNA are shown in Fig. 10.
[Ru(bpy)2(pztp)]2/
increases the viscosity of DNA dramatically and nearly linearly at low complex
concentration ([Ru]/[DNA] < 0.15). The result suggests that [Ru(bpy)2(pztp)]2/
may bind to DNA by
intercalation mode despite its much smaller hypochromism in absorption spectra compared with some known
intercalator such as [Ru(bpy)2(ppz)]2+/52/and [Ru(bpy)2(pip)]2//53/. However, [(bpy)2Ru(pztp)Ru(bpy)]4+
decreases the viscosity of DNA dramatically. With two [Ru(bpy)3]2/-like units, the dinuclear complex cannot
intercalate between the base pairs of DNA even partially, so it is just an electrostatic binder. Unlike other
bimetallic systems, the rigid structure of bridging ligand in [(bpy)zRu(pztp)Ru(bpy)2]4/
prevents the further
enhancement of DNA bind affinity.
4. A NOVEL "MOLECULAR LIGHT SWITCH" FOR DNA
Recently, because of their attractive luminescent properties which are extremely sensitive to the
microenvironment, Ru(II) complexes have been used as photoprobes of DNA structures and conformations
/1,2/. However, the emission of Ru(II) complexes switched by double strand DNA is rare. [Ru(bpy)z(dppz)]2+
and [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+, the most extensively investigated "molecular light switch" for DNA, show no
luminescence in aqueous solution but luminesce intensely in the presence of DNA/54/. In our laboratory, two
novel complexes [Ru(pztp)2(phen)]2+
and [Ru(pztp)2(bpy)]2/
are found to posses the similar properties/24/.
They represent the kind of non-dppz based Ru(ll) complex as molecular "light switch" for DNA.
[Ru(pztp)2(phen)l2+
and [Ru(pztp)2(bpy)]2+
do not luminesce in aqueous solution either, but that they emit
luminescence at 590 nm and show emission enhancement in the presence of increasing amounts of CT-DNA
upon excitation at 462 nm (Fig. 11). On saturation with CT-DNA, the typical relative emission intensities for

The mechanism of the "light switch" effect for [Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+
has been studied intensively and
accumulated evidence points to hydrogen bonding and/or excited state proton transfer to the phenazine
nitrogens as the mechanism of deactivation ofthe complexes' excited state [54-59].
To explore the possible mechanism involved in the light switch effect, an experiment similar to
[Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+
was carried out. It is noted that the luminescences of [Ru(pztp)z(phen)]2+
and
[Ru(pztp)2(bpy)]2/
in CH3CN are very sensitive to water, being almost completely quenched in the presence
of 5% water (v/v). Fig. 12(A) shows the progressive decrease of the emission intensity of [Ru(pztp)z(phen)]2/
in CH3CN upon the addition of H20. The titration curves showing the effect of H20 on the emission of
[Ru(pztp)z(phen)]2+
and [Ru(pztp)z(bpy)]2+
in CH3CN are shown in Fig. 12(B). Similar to that for
[Ru(phen)2(dppz)]2+
[31], at low H20 concentrations, ([H20] < 0.3 mol din-3), the data fit the Perrin sphere of
quenching model very well. Based on Fig. 12(B), the luminescence of [Ru(pztp)2(bpy)]2+
is more sensitive to
water than that of [Ru(pztp)z(phen)]2+. These results indicate that the above complexes may experience a
similar "light switch" mechanism to that proposed for [Ru(phen)z(dppz)]2+, whose emission is also solvent
dependent and displays almost the same trend [59].
