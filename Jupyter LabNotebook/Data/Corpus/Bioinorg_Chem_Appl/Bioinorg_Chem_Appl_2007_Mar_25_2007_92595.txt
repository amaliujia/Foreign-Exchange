1. INTRODUCTION
During a chemical reaction process, the reactant atoms are
combined in different ways to form new compounds called products.
Apart from the rearrangement of the atoms involved in the reaction
process, a change in energy occurs which either is released to the
environment or taken from the environment. The energy released by
a spontaneous reaction to the environment is in most cases heat
energy measured in calories per mole and such reactions are called
exothermic. An exothermic reaction may also release energy in
other forms of energy apart from heat. Reactions that release
energy greater than 41 kcal per mole can give CL-emission.
Oxidation reactions are usually accompanied by large energy
release. The wavelength of CL-emission is calculated from the
 equation  where h = Planck constant, c = the velocity of light, and λ = the wavelength of the emitted light.

The CL-intensity, on the other hand, is limited by the rules of
the quantum yield, and the thermodynamic and kinetic constants of
the reaction process as well as by the presence of quenching
effects.

CL-reagents are in most cases light absorbing compounds of rigid
structure in order to be deactivated by CL-emission when are
activated from the oxidation reaction. If the activated species
have very low quantum yield either because they relax with heat
release or the environment favors quenching, a good advice is to
add a fluorescent compound of relatively high yield in the
reaction mixture to enable energy-transfer from the activated
species to the fluorescent molecule. Such an example is the energy
transfer of (O2)2* excimer to fluorescent compound
that has energy states close to that of the excimer [, ] as
shown in .

1.1. CL-reagents
The CL-reagents used in chemical analysis are mostly Luminol,
Lucigenin, TCPO, and acridine derivatives. TCPO has the largest
quantum yield (21%) from all while the other ones around 1–5%.
All of them show rapid rate of reaction with oxidants 
[]. The oxidation reactions that take place with the above CL-reagents
are shown in . Pyrogallol is a molecule that
can be oxidized fairly easily by most of the oxidants, but with a
faint only CL-emission [].

1.2. Pyrogallol in human activities and its
CL-detection in analytical chemistry
Pyrogallol or benzene-1,2,3-triol 
(C6H6O3) is a white
crystalline powder and a powerful reducing agent. It is used in
photography as developing agent, hair dying, dying of suturing
 materials, and for oxygen adsorption in gas analysis. It is also used in surgery for his antiseptic properties. The material is available as an analytical chemical reagent with a purity &gt; 99%.

Pyrogallol structural group is found in polyphenols, tannins, as
constituents of a great variety of various plant products, fruits,
and nutrition products, for example, red wine, grapes, tea, and so
forth. Humic acids include compounds that bear the pyrogallol or
gallic acid functional group. Tannins are also used in various
industrial processes for the treatment of various raw materials
like leather.

1.3. Periodate oxidation of pyrogallol mechanism
Periodate oxidation of different methoxy derivatives of pyrogallol
proceeds rapidly with the production of o- and p-quinones, and
slowly with products of quinone condensation and the formation of
Diels-Alder dimmers.

The complexity of periodate oxidation chemistry includes a wealth
of products that are formed through different reaction pathways
generated by the reactive quinone intermediates and are
kinetically controlled. The condensed quinone products bear the
necessary requirements for an energy transfer process from excited
species since these molecules include double bonds and their
structure is rigid; and they present a tempting case of
investigation possibilities of enhancing CL-emission.

An example of the mechanism of pyrogallol oxidation by hydrogen
peroxide through the so-called Trazt-Schorigin reaction
[–] is given in .

During this oxidation process, an excited singlet oxygen is formed
and the light emission occurs via intermolecular energy transfer
as well as simple excimer emission according to reaction, 


1.4. Oxygen equilibria
As shown above, the oxidation of pyrogallol through
Trazt-Schorigin reaction is proceeding in the presence of various
oxygen species stable in alkaline solution (O2,
HO2−, O2−). However, in the complex regime
of pyrogallol oxidation and the intensely reactive environment of
the reaction mixture, other oxygen redox state may be 
involved.  shows the redox oxygen equilibria with the
H2O2 species associated with pH values of aqueous media.

1.5. Instrumentation ()
Recent progress in the field of photomultiplier technology led to
the production of highly sensitive detectors; thus, CL-emission of relatively low intensity is now measured
accurately. This made CL-detection a useful detecting tool for the
determination of μM and even nM concentrations of analytes.

Combining CL-detection with flow-injection manifold, the
analytical procedure becomes rapid, convenient, and reproducible;
furthermore, the apparatus is simple, inexpensive, and portable
for in situ measurements. Finally, it is easily automated for
routine analysis work, remote controlled for unattended
monitoring.

Interference from other compounds in the sample is confronted by
various separation methods or with use of in-line enzyme reactors
in most cases.

2. PUBLISHED WORKS FROM THE RESEARCH GROUP
OF PROFESSOR EVMIRIDIS
A study [] of the effect of active oxygen species on the
pyrogallol oxidation by H2O2 at pH 11 (optimum condition
for CL-emission) was investigated using specific trapping agents
and scavengers for each oxygen active species such as NaN3
for singlet oxygen, SOD (superoxide dismutase) for the
•O2−, CAT (catalase) and PER
(peroxidase) for H2O2 according to the following
reaction:  From the data obtained () it was concluded
that •O2− species are playing the major role
for the appearance of CL-emission at pH 11 since the CL-emission
was extinguished by the addition of SOD. In addition,
−OOH species are playing role in the CL-emission at lower
pH values since the CL-emission increased by the addition of
PER at pH 7. Surprisingly, the CL-emission increased with
NaN3 addition suggesting that NOX species may be involved.

The intensity of CL-emission generated during pyrogallol oxidation
by different oxidizing agents was followed by various oxidizing
reagents []. The oxidizing reagents that generated
CL-emission at a measurable level of intensity were the
permanganate anion with maximum at pH 1.5, Ce(IV) with
maximum at pH 4.0 (restricted by precipitation above pH 4),
periodate with maximum at pH 7.8, hypochlorite with maximum at pH
9.0, and H2O2 with maximum at pH 11.0 (). The intensity of CL-emission was followed also by the concentration ratio between the oxidizing agent and
the pyrogallol at the maximum pH for each oxidant. The ratio
obtained when the change of the CL-emission level reached a
plateau for the different oxidizing agents was 2 (10 electron
oxidation) for the permanganate anion, 7.0 for 
Ce(IV), 3 (6 electron oxidation for the rapid part of reaction) for periodate anion, and 2 for ClO− and H2O2; thus suggesting that permanganate anion and Ce(IV) cation are strong oxidizing agents while hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide are soft oxidants and
periodate is in the middle of the scale. Finally, the intensity of
CL-emission was followed with pyrogallol concentration and the
data obtained () showed that the maxima for 
CL-emission were 5 mM for permanganate anion, 0.5 mM for
the Ce(IV) cation, 0.75 mM for periodate anion, around
3 mM for hyprochlorite anion, and around 1.5 mM for
H2O2. The order of sensitivity based on optimum conditions for each oxidizing agent is MnO4− ≫ IO4− &gt; H2O2 &gt; Ce(IV) ≈ ClO−.

The possibility for finding compounds with enhancing effect was
tested and among the ones tested the NH2OH · HCl increased CL-emission generated during the pyrogallol oxidation by periodate 6-fold []. Furthermore, the CL-emission was followed with the concentration ratio between the pyrogallol and the hydroxylamine hydrochloride and an optimum ratio was found to be around 1. From absorption
spectra and fluorescence spectra, the formation of
Pyrogallol-Hydroxylamine complex was indicated
[].

Optimized conditions for the determination of pyrogallol based on
CL-emission generated during the periodate oxidation in the
presence of hydroxylamine hydrochloride using
FI/CL-detection apparatus were found, and an analytical method for
pyrogallol determination was developed [] 
(). The reported analytical parameters are
linear valid range from 5 μM up to 0.75 mM;
sensitivity 270 V L/mol; LOD 1.0 μM; RSD 1%, and sample throughput 10 per minute
().

Optimized conditions were obtained for the determination of
periodate based on CL-emission [] generated by pyrogallol using flow-injection/CL-detection apparatus. A sigmoid calibration
curve was obtained with periodate standard solutions in the range
of 0.5 mM up to 10 mM with LOD 10 μM, RSD 3%, and sample throughput 15 per minute.

A procedure [] of the best fit model equation of periodate
calibration curve followed by parameterization of the equation
constants was based on home software using a modification of the
pattern search method and supported by a graphical method for
approximating the initial parameter values of each model equation
tested and criteria based on absolute error of residual variance.
Among the various model equations, a best fit to the experimental
data was found with the model equation 

with parameters a = 39 ± 5, 
b = 0.5 ± 0.2, and c = 1.3 ± 0.1
().

A study [] of the error structure of the model equation  parameters was studied using the pattern
search modification (mentioned above) for optimum parameter
estimation based on various criteria (absolute or
relative error) of residual variance, assuming normal
distribution of errors and outliers, and employing a
pseudorandom number generator of the mixed congruential method for
collecting errors from a normal
distribution of population errors and outliers according
 to
the procedure described. Absolute errors or relative errors were
considered. The results obtained were tested for the
percentage of bias and the distributions of the errors for
skewness and excess curtosis.

In another study the experimental design is obtained for the rapid 
estimation of the parameters of the sigmoid periodate calibration curve based on the D-optimality criterion []. 
 With this facility it was not necessary to find a large number of data
points to draw the sigmoid periodate calibration curve
().

The determination of periodate by flow-injection/CL-detection
method [] was applied for the indirect determination of the
ethylene glycol by measuring the excess of periodate remained
after treatment of the sample with specific volume of standard
periodate solution. The proposed method was applied for the
determination of ethyleneglycol in real samples such as commercial
 car-antifreeze preparations and water from car
radiators and the proposed method was in close agreement with
Fleury-Lange method used as a validation test
().

A simulaltaneous kinetic determination of glucose and fructose was
proposed [] using the flow-injection CL-detection method in
samples containing both analytes in mixture. The proposed method
is based on the difference in kinetic constants of periodate
oxidation between these two analytes. The experimental data from
the standard solutions of mixed analytes in different proportions
are found to follow the kinetic equation  and the periodate calibration curve equation 
				 
where L = 5[Hex]0
− [IO4−]0 and [Hex]0 
= [Glc]0 + 
[Fru]0, 
[Glc]0 = initial
glucose concentration in the sample, 
[Fru]0 = initial 
fructose concentration in the sample, k = overall kinetic
constant, time from the start of oxidation reaction.

The overall kinetic constant is changed with the ratio of
[Glc]0/[Fru]0 at constant [Hex]0
exponentially. Calibration curves with concentration of
[Hex]0 at various constant ratios of
[Glc]0/[Fru]0 are shown in .

The indirect determination of propranolol with periodate oxidation
in a flow-injection/CL-detection apparatus is proposed [] sed on the determination of the excess of periodate. The
calibration curve follows two linear ranges
(), the initial one is short and sharp and
covers the concentration range 0.10 to 1.0 ppm with LOD
37 ppb and RSD 0.4%; the second one covers the concentration
range 1.0 to 20 ppm and with sensitivity 20 times less than
the first one. In addition, a study for interferences was made
that showed NO−2 and Cr3+ to be the major
interferent compounds ().

A study of the CL-emission generated by oxidation of pyrogallol
was made on-line with HPLC of eluted analytes [, ] using
post-column FI/CL-detection apparatus ().

RP-HPLC elution solvents include MeOH, AcCN, and
THF in mixtures with water. In general, CL-emission is
generated by permanganate oxidation of organic compounds. The
CL-emission generated by the permanganate oxidation of organic
solvent gives an intense background that makes CL-emission of
eluted analytes undetectable.

In both these research studies, attempts are made to reduce the
background level. The studies resulted in the method of solvent
pre-oxidative chemiluminescence (SPOC) that decreases the
background level, adequately for the determination of all the
sunlight absorbing ingredients of a commercial preparation in
RP-HPLC isothermal elution () and to obtain a
smooth slow increase of background in gradient elution
().

The oxidation of H2O2 by periodate in potassium carbonate
aqueous solution was employed by Lin et al. 
[] for the
determination of trace amounts of 
H2O2 in snow water with
flow-injection/CL-detection apparatus. The ratio of the
signal-to-noise (S/N) is proportional to the concentration of
hydrogen peroxide up to 10 μM. The detection limit with
the flow-injection method is 0.005 μM H2O2 (S/N = 3). The relative standard 
deviation (RSD) for 0.04 μM hydrogen peroxide is 2.8% (n = 14). Sample throughput is ca. 100 h−1. 
The selectivity of this method is very high, and most of the transition metal ions have no effect on the determination.

A sensitive and stable periodate-hydrogen peroxide CL-system was
 used by Zhang and Chen [] for the
determination of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate in a
flow-injection/CL-detection apparatus. The 3σ detection
limit for SDBS is 0.032 μg/mL in a system using a
trace of cyclohexane and the relative standard deviation of this
method is 1.6% at 1.0 μg/mL for 11 determinations.

A flow-injection chemiluminescent method is proposed by Nakano
et al. [] for the determination of vanadium (IV) and total vanadium by its catalytic action on the periodate-purpurogallin
CL-reagent to generate light at 4°C. 
The presence of hydrogen carbonate enhanced the CL-emission arising from the
vanadium (IV)-catalyzed reaction. Vanadium (V) is then determined
after being reduced to vanadium (IV) by using an on-line silver
reducing column. Calibration curves for vanadiums (IV)
and (V) were linear in the range 0.1–10 ng/mL with
sampling rate of about 50 h−1. The limit of detection for
signal-to-noise ratio of 2 was 0.05 ng/mL and the
relative standard deviations were 1.4 and 1.6% for ten
determinations of 2.0 ng/mL of vanadiums (IV)
and (V), respectively. Interferences from metal ions could be
eliminated by the use of O,O′-bis(2-aminoethyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic
acid and diphosphate as masking agents. The proposed method was
successfully applied to the determination of vanadium (IV) and
total vanadium in fresh water samples.

A flow-injection/CL-sensor apparatus is described by Xiong
et al. [] for the determination of 
isoniazid in urine samples. The sensor is based on molecularly imprinted polymer
technology and the detection of luminol-periodate
CL-reagent. The enhanced CL-intensity is linear in the range 
0.002–0.2 μg/mL and the detection limit is 
0.007 μg/mL (3σ) isoniazid with a relative standard deviation 2.8% (n = 9) for 0.08 μg/mL. The sensor is reversible and reusable. It has a great improvement in sensitivity and selectivity for CL-analysis. As a result, the sensor has been
successfully applied to determination of isoniazid in human urine.
At the same time, the binding characteristic of the polymer to
isoniazid was evaluated by batch method and the dynamic method,
respectively.
