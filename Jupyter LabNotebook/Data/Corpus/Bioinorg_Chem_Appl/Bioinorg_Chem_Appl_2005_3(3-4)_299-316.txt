GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
The copper(II) complexes of acylthiourea derivatives have been synthesized and characterized by elemental
analysis, FT-IR, FAB(+)-MS, NMR(1H, 13C), magnetic measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Assessment
of antitumor activity against the mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 cell line has demonstrated that all
Cun complexes were more active than their respective ligands and Cu(L3)2 showed a higher cytotoxicity than
all the compounds tested. Cellular copper accumulation and DNA binding were also determined and the
results are consistent with the cytotoxic activities obtained.

Complexes
ABSTRACT
The copper (II) complexes (CuL2) were prepared by reaction of Cu(CH3COO)2 with the corresponding
derivatives of acylthioureas in a Cu:HL molar ratio of 1:2. Acylthiourea ligands, N,N-diethyl-N'-(R-
benzoyl)thiourea (HLj'3) JR=H, o-C1 and p-NO2] were synthesized in high yield (78-83%) and characterized
by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The complexes CuL2 were
characterized by elemental analysis, IR, FAB(+)-MS, magnetic susceptibility measurements, EPR and cyclic
voltammetry. The crystal structure of the complex Cu(L2)z shows a nearly square-planar geometry with two
deprotonated ligands (L) coordinated to Cun
through the oxygen and sulfur atoms in a cis arrangement. The
antitumor activity of the copper(II) complexes with acylthiourea ligands was evaluated in vitro against the
mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 cell line. These complexes exhibited much higher cytotoxic activity
(ICs0 values in the range of 3.9-6.9 tM) than their corresponding ligands (40-240 tM), which indicates that
the coordination of the chelate ligands around the CuII
enhances the antitumor activity and, furthermore, this
result confirmed that the participation of the nitro and chloro substituent groups in the complex activities is
slightly relevant. The high accumulation of the complexes Cu(L)2 and Cu(L3)2 in TA3 tumor cells and the
much faster binding to cellular DNA than Cu(L1)2 are consistent with the in vitro cytotoxic activities found
for these copper complexes.

1. INTRODUCTION
Whilst most of the investigations in the treatment of cancer diseases are oriented to synthesize new metal
complexes analogous to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) (antineoplastic agent of clinical use)/1,
2/, there is a growing number of non-platinum metal complexes which also exhibit remarkable anticancer
activities/3-5/. Thus, the bis(acetate) bis(imidazole)copper(II) complex has shown a high cytotoxic activity
against to the mouse B16 melanoma cancer cell line, and determinations realized with d X174 RF DNA
indicate that the target of this complex may be the guanine residues of the DNA helix/6/. In addition, the
copper (II) complexes with thiosemicarbazone derivatives (O,N,S-tridentate chelate ligands) are well-known
by their biological applications as antiviral/7/, antimicrobial/8/, antitubercular and antitumor agents/9-11/.
In this sense, Antholine et al. /12, 13/have reported that the copper complex [{CuL(MeCO2)}.] (HL=2-
formylpyridine thiosemicarbazone) and related compounds have marked antitumor activities, being more
potent than the free ligands against Ehrlich cells injected into mice/14/, Sarcoma 180 ascites tumors/15/and
Chinese hamster ovary cells/16, 17/. On the other hand, the biological activities of complexes with thiourea
derivatives have been successfully screened for various biological actions/18-21/. Recently, Xu Shen et al.
/22/ have reported the antitumor activities of the MnI
complex derived from the desulfurization and
hydrolysis of the ligand, N-(p-nitrophenyl)-N'-(methoxycarbonyl) thiourea. This complex showed high

cytotoxicity in vitro at micromolar concentrations against human ovary tumor 3 AO and mice P388 in vitro.
In our previous work, we reported the in vitro antitumor activity of the platinum (II) complexes with
analogousligands against mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 cells, where these complexes showed to be
more cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations than their corresponding ligands/23/. Since our earlier
work had revealed that platinum complexation with acylthiourea ligands enhances the antitumor activity, we
were motivated to use copper as different central atom in order to obtain a cytotoxic behaviour similar to the
platinum complexes mentioned before. In the present work, we report about synthesis and characterization of
copper(lI) complexes with ligands N,N-diethyl-N'-R-benzoylthiourea [R=H, o-C1 and p-NO2] and their in
vitro cytotoxic effect, copper accumulation and binding to cellular DNA on mouse TA3 mammary
adenocarcinoma.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Materials
Copper(II)acetate monohydrate, sodium sulphate, sodium bicarbonate, benzoylchloride, o-
chlorobenzoylchloride, p-nitrobenzoylchloride and diethylamine from Aldrich were used as received. All
solvents were reagent grade and were purified by standard procedures before use.
Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium [MEM(E)] was supplied by Sigma (USA) and the fetal bovine
serum [FBS] was provided by Difco (Detroit, MI). The penicillin, streptomycin and sodium chloride 0.9%
were obtained from Sanderson's laboratory (Chile).
2.2. Measurements
Elemental analyses were carried out on a Fisons-Carlo Erba 1108 elemental microanalyser. Melting
points were determined on a Boetius melting-point apparatus. Magnetic susceptibilities at room temperature
(296 K) were measured using the Gouy method on a Johnson-Mathey MSB-MKI balance with HgCo(NCS)4
as standard and diamagnetic corrections were made using Pascal's constants/24/. The infrared (IR) spectra
were recorded in solid state (KBr pellets) on a Bruker FT-IR IFS 55 Equinox spectrophotometer in the range
4000 400 cm.FAB(+) mass spectra were obtained on a ZAB-HSQ (V.G. Analytical Ltd.) spectrometer.
Determinations of copper concentration in biological samples were performed on a Perkin Elmer 3110
atomic absorption spectrometer. NMR (H and 3C) spectra of the ligands were recorded on a Bruker
Advance DRX-300, using CDCI3 as solvent and TMS as internal standard. Cyclic voltammetric
measurements were made in DMSO solvent on a Bioanalytical System BAS CV-50 W with an X-Y recorder
using a carbon disk (6 mm diameter) as working electrode vs. SCE as reference and a Pt filament as auxiliary
electrode. The solutions of the complexes (1 x 10.3
M ) in DMSO with tetrabutylammonium perchlorate
(TBAP) (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte were deoxygenated by a stream of dry nitrogen for at least 10 min.
EPR spectra of the copper complexes solutions in CH2CI at room temperature were measured using a Brukcr
ESP 300 E spectrometer operating at X-band t'requency.

2.4 Synthesis of the copper(ll) complexes
The complexes were prepared according to the following general procedure.
To a stirred solution of N,N-diethyl-N'-(R-benzoyl)thiourea (1 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) was added
dropwise a solution of Cu(CH3COO)2 HO (0.5 mmol) in methanol (30 mL). The reaction mixture was
refluxed for 1 h and then stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The green solution was filtrated and the filtrate
was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to yield a dark green solid. The solid was washed several
times with small portions of cold ethanol and dried in vacuo.

2.5. Crystal structure determination
The crystallographic data of Cu(L2)2 were obtained on a Siemens CCD Smart Diffractometer (Mo Kc
radiation, =0.71073 A, graphite monochromator, T 218(2) K). The intensities were corrected for Lorentz
and polarization effects and for absorption using SADABS. The structure was solved by direct methods,
which revealed the positions of all non-hydrogen atoms and refined on Fz
by a full-matrix least-squares
procedure using anisotropic displacement parameters. The hydrogen atoms were located from difference
Fourier syntheses and refined isotropically. All calculations were carried out using the SHELXS-97 and
SHELXL-97 programs/27-28/. Crystal data collection and refinement details for the complex Cu(L2)2 are
summarized in Table 1.

2.6. Biological evaluation
2.6.1. Culture ofcells and cytotoxic assay
The mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 cell line was obtained from ascites fluid of young adult male
CAF Jax mice. The cells were cultured at 37 C in a growth medium consisting of Eagle's Minimum
Essential Medium [MEM(E)] with Earle's Salts, L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES, supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum [FBS], 44 mM sodium bicarbonate, 100 U mL"1
penicillin and 100 lag mL"1
streptomycin.
For these experiments, cells at a concentration of 2 x 105 mL1
were seeded by 96 h in 20 mL of culture
medium/29/. After 24 h of tumor cell growth, the compounds were dissolved in DMSO just before the
experiments and a calculated amount of drug solution was added to each growth medium to obtain the
desired concentrations of either the ligands ( 20, 40 and 60 laM)or their copper complexes (1, 5 y 10 laM).
The final DMSO concentration in the culture medium, 0.5%, did not show an appreciable effect on cell
growth for these assays. Parallel cultures were used as control. Viable cells were determined using a
Neubauer counting chamber every 24 h. The concentrations of every compound were plotted with respect to
the percentage of cell survival. The IC.s0 values were obtained by graphical interpolation at 48 h of exposure
on each one of the compounds. These values represent the drug concentration (laM) required to inhibit cell
growth by 50%. All assays were performed in triplicate cultures and repeated three times in independent
pattern.
2.6.2. Cellular copper accumulation
Cells (5 x 106 mL) were incubated at 37 C with each one of the copper complexes (125 laM). After
various time intervals, an aliquot of the mixture was removed and assayed according to the reported method
/30/. Briefly, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with ice-cold PBS (0.1 M
phosphate buffer in 0.15 M NaC1, pH 7.4). Pellets were dried and digested overnight in concentrated nitric
acid, then diluted with distilled water to give a final HNO3 concentration of 20%. Cellular copper
concentrations were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and the amount of accumulate0 Cu was
expressed as nmol Cu/106
cells.
2.6.3. Binding to cellular DNA in TA3
Each one of the copper complexes (20-100 tM) was incubated with the TA3 tumor cells (5 x 106/mL )
at 37 C for 2 h of exposure. Then, cells were isolated by centrifugation, suspended in mL of PBS and
centrifuged again. This washing step was repeated twice. After centrifugation cells were taken up in 500 tL
of TEN buffer, pH 8 (10 mM Tris, 10 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCI), and subsequently 5 laL ofproteinase
K and 50 laL of 10% SDS were added. Lysed cells were kept at 55 C for h. Proteins were then removed by
chloroform/phenol (1:1) extraction followed by an extraction with chloroform alone. DNA was precipitated
from the aqueous layer by adding an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. Finally, precipitated DNA was
removed from the solution, washed with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 1 mL of water/31/.
The DNA concentration was determined by measuring the UV absorption at 260 nm and concentration of
base pairs was calculated using mean molar extinction coefficient per base pair 260 16800 M1
cm1.
Copper concentration was measured by FAAS. From this information, the rb values (the number of drug
305

molecules bound per base) were calculated.

Complexes
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Synthesis
The synthesis of the copper(II) complexes and their ligands is shown in Scheme 1. The acylthiourea
ligands, N,N-diethyl-N'-R-benzoylthiourea (l-IL HL and HL3) were prepared according to the methods
described by Hartmann /25/ and Brindley/26/. The synthesis involves the reaction of R-benzoyl chloride
with potassium thiocyanate in acetone followed by reacting R-benzoyl isothiocyanate with diethylamine. For
the synthesis of I-IL3, a modification of Brindley's method was carried out; the solvent used was acetone
instead of acetonitrile and the intermediary product, isothiocyanate, was not removed from the reaction
mixture. With these changes it was possible to obtain a high yield, which was compared with those obtained
for related acylthioureas described in the literature/32, 33/. The ligands I-IL and HL were recrystallized
from mixed solvents of CH2CI2-CH3OH (2:1, v/v) and CHC13-EtOH (2:1, v/v), respectively, whereas HL3
was recrystallized from CH2C12. The ligands were obtained in satisfactory yield (78-83 %) and characterized
by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
The copper (II) complexes Cu(L)2, Cu(L2)2 and Cu(La)2 were prepared by refluxing the methanolic
mixture of the ligand (HL) and Cu(CH3COO)2- H20 in the molar ratio of 2:1. With this employed technique,
the yields of copper(II) complexes were improved as related to other methods that carry out the synthesis
during several days at room temperature/34/. Recrystallization of the complex Cu(L)2 from hot ethanol
yielded crystals suitable for structural determination by X-ray diffraction. All three copper (II) complexes
were characterized by elemental analysis and IR, FAB(+)-mass, magnetic susceptibility, EPR and cyclic
voltammetry. The elemental and spectroscopic analysis of the ligands and their copper (II) complexes are
consistent with the proposed structures given in Scheme 1. In general, the methods used for the preparation
of these compounds were adopted because they are fast, easy and give higher yields than other methods,
which contain some modifications in the synthetic route, such as, temperature, reaction time, solvents and
separation procedures of the product.
3.2. IR and H-NMR spectra
In the IR spectra, al'l acylthiourea ligands exhibited NH stretching bands in the range of 3200- 3284 cm1,
which disappeared after coordination. This indicates the loss of the proton originally bonded to nitrogen atom
of the (NH-CO) amide group. The vibrational frequencies due to the carbonyl (1648-1690 cm) and
thiocarbonyl (1230-1233 cm1
) groups in the free ligands are shifted (65-68 and 21-25 cm1, respectively)
towards lower frequencies upon complexation, confirming that the deprotonated ligands are coordinated to
Cuu
ion through the oxygen and sulfur donor atoms/35-37/.
In the H-NMR spectra for the ligands, the presence of the chloro- and nitro- substituent groups on the
benzoyl moiety (HLz and HL3), causes no significant changes in the chemical shifts of the N-H group (8.32
306
W.Hernandez et al. Bioinorganic Chem&try andApplications
and 8.41 ppm, respectively) relative to the ligand I-IL (8.35 ppm) with unsubstituted benzoyl moiety. The
aromatic protons signals (ortho and meta ) are shifted upfield (0.49 and 0.24 ppm, respectively) for I-IL2
and
downfield (0.17 and 0.86 ppm, respectively) for HL3
with respect to HL.These results are consistent with
the mesomeric/inductive effects expected for these substituents. On the other hand, the resonances of the
methylene protons bonded to the nitrogen of the respective thioamide group appeared as two separated
signals at 3.61-3.69 and 3.97-4.04 ppm, respectively, showing in each signal a well-resolved quartet. The
magnetic inequivalence of the CH2 protons can be attributed to the restricted rotation around the C-N bond
between the thiocarbonyl group and the amine nitrogen due to the partial double character of this bond
/38, 39/.
3.3. Magnetic data and EPR spectra
The room temperature magnetic moments for the copper (II) complexes Cu(L)2, Cu(L2)z and Cu(L3)2
resulted to be 2.0, 1.93 and 1.82 BM, respectively. These values are consistent with the presence of one
unpaired electron in mononuclear d9
copper (II) complexes. Furthermore, these magnetic data .are ,in
agreement with those of the cis-bis(acylthioureato) copper (II) complexes (tci-f= 1.8-2.00 BM) reported in the
literature/32, 40/.
The X-band EPR spectra for these copper(II) complexes were determined in CH2C12 solution at room
temperature. All three spectra exhibit four well-resolved absorption lines (Icu=3/2) with isotropic parameters
(g .,,= 2.083-2.084 and A.,,,:" 79.8-80.4 G) and these results are similar to those of previously reported
copper(II) complexes of square-planar geometry which contain acylthiourea and imidoylthiourea ligands (g
s,,= 2.081-2.082; Ai.,,t:u
63.0-78.0 G; T=293K, CHCI3)/41-44/.
3.4 Electrochemical studies
The redox processes of the copper (II) complexes were electrochemically confirmed by cyclic
voltammetry. The voltammograms of all free ligands do not present any oxidation or reduction peak in the
potential range studied, except for the ligand HL3, which show a reduction peak at-1.05 V, which may
correspond to the reduction of the p-nitrophenyl group. Cyclic voltammograms of the copper (II) complexes
in DMSO show a quasi-reversible voltammetric response for the Cu(II)/Cu(1) couple with reduction peaks at
--0.30, -0.23 and -0.21 V, and AEp values (where AEp =/Epc-Ep/) of 89, 95 and 91 mV for the complexes
Cu(L), Cu(L2)2 and Cu(L3)2 (Figure 2a), respectively. The ratio of anodic (ipa) and cathodic (/pc) peak
currents is in the range of 0.83-0.91 at 100 mVs scan rate. The AEp values for these complexes were lower
than those of related copper complexes (AEp >200 mV in DMF) considered in the literature as irreversible
processes /34/. Furthermore, as we can observe in Figure 2b, the cyclic voltammogram for the complex
Cu(L3)2 shows that the metal-based potential peaks change with the scan rate (50-500 mV s) indicating that
the redox process becomes more irreversible as reported for thc related copper complexes too/40/.
The presence of the nitro and chloro substituent groups on the bcnzoyl moiety has a weak influence on
the electrochemical properties of these copper (II) complexes /32/. Only small differences found in the

cathodic potentials indicate that Cu(L)2 must be more difficult to reduce than Cu(L2) and Cu(L3)z with the
chloro and nitro substituent groups on the benzoyl moiety.

3.5. Structural data
The molecular structure of the complex Cu(L), together with the atom numbering scheme adopted, is
shown in Fig. 1. Selected bond distances and bond angles are listed in Table 2.
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the structure shows that the copper(II) ion has a slightly distorted square-
planar geometry indicated by the angle between the planes CulS101 and CulS202 of 12.1(1).The
structural determination of this complex confirms that two deprotonated ligands are coordinated bidentately
to the copper(II) ion through the sulphur and oxygen donor atoms in a cis arrangement /44,45/. The
coordination around the Cu ion generates two six-membered chelate rings, which form angles with the
adjacent phenyl groups of 48.2(1) and 43.0(1).This result probably indicates that the presence of the chloro
substituent on the benzoyl moiety leads to a steric repulsion between chelate rings and phenyl rings.
By comparison with the reported structure of the free ligand I-IL2
/46/, the bond lengths of the
thiocarbonyl (S!-C1 1.738(2), $2-C13 1.735(2) ) and carbonyl (O1-C2 1.261(3), O2-C14 1.264(2) A)
moieties in the complex Cu(L2) are longer than in its ligand (S=C 1.658(2), O=C 1.218(2) A) whereas the
N-C bond distances in this complex (N1-C1 1.353(3)/N3-C13 1.350(2) and N1-C2 1.320(3)/N3-C14 1.325(2)
A) are shorter compared to I-IL (N1-C1 1.428(2) and N1-C2 1.360(2) A). This indicates that the decrease of
the bond orders of the thiocarbonyl and carbonyl groups together with the changes in the N-C bond lengths
on coordination, originates from a n-electron delocalization over the chelate ring of the complex Cu(L)z
/33,46/.

3.6. Antitumor evaluation
The acylthiourea ligands and the complexes Cu(L)2, Cu(L2)z and Cu(L3h were tested in vitro for their
cytotoxic activity against mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 cell line. Figures 3 and 4 show the
concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of ligands and their respective copper (II) complexes on the
percentage of cell survival at 48 h of exposure on culture medium. In Figure 3, we can observe that the ligand
HLa showed a major cytotoxic activity (--- 40 tM) than ligands HL and HL (>160 laM) in the survival range
of 50-60 %. This high cytotoxicity that HL3
presents could be due to the biotransformation of the nitrophenyl
group to its nitrophenyl radical anion (PhNOi') catalyzed by the enzyme NADPH- cytochrome P450
reductase, together with the formation of the superoxide radical anion (O2")/47-49/. As we can see in Figure
4, the copper (II) complexes turned out to be highly more cytotoxic than their ligands, at concentration range
of 1-10 tM for 48 h of exposure in tumor cells. The complex Cu(La)_ presented a constant decrease of
cellular survival by about 15 % higher in comparison with Cu(Llh and Cu(L)2 in the range of 1-5 laM. The
copper complexes show a strong inhibition of the cell proliferation at the concentration of 10 tM, where the
cell survival was reduced to 20 % of the control. These results indicate that the chelation of acylthiourea
ligands with copper (II) dramatically enhances the cytotoxic activities. Furthermore, the participation of the
nitro and chloro substituent groups in the activity of complexes is slightly relevant.

IC50 values for the tested compounds are given in Table 3. The ligands showed high IC50 values at the
range of 40.0- 240 tM, whereas the complexes Cu(L1)2, Cu(L2) and Cu(L3) displayed the lowest IC50
values (6.93, 5.42 and 3.87 laM, respectively) against to the TA3 tumor cell line. These results were
comparable with those of the square-planar copper (II) complexes of thiosemicarbazone and
carboxamidazone derivatives (IC50 12.5 and 3.0 tM, respectively) tested against the MCF-7 human breast
adenocarcinoma cell line/50, 51/. On the other hand, the IC50 values of these copper (II) complexes resulted
to be near to those of the related platinum (II) complexes (IC50 2.6- 2.8 laM) /23/ and cisplatin (IC50 1.3
tM) evaluated in the same tumor cell line. These results demonstrate that the bis-chelate copper complexes,
with a slightly distorted square-planar geometry play an important role in the inhibition of TA3 tumor cell
growth.

3.7. Accumulation of copper in TA3 cells and binding to cellular DNA
As we can see from Figure 5, the complexes Cu(L2) and Cu(L3)2 enter into the cells more rapidly than
Cu(LI)z. After 2.5 h of exposure, copper accumulated in TA3 cells from complexes Cu(LI), Cu(L) and
Cu(L3)z were 7.12, 12.1 and 14.5 nmol Cu/106 cells, respectively. Significantly, 2.3 times higher Cu(L3)
than Cu(L) was accumulated in TA3 cells, whereas Cu(L3)z cellular accumulation was only slightly higher
than Cu(LZ)z. Complexes Cu(L)2 and Cu(L3) are incorporated in TA3 cells at similar concentrations than
platinum(ll) complex, PtNH3Cb(L) [L=2-Phenyipyridine] (100 tM, 3 h of exposure) in mouse sarcoma 180
cells (13.5 nmol Pt/106 cells)/52/. These results indicate that the hydrophobicity of these copper complexes
together with the presence of the nitro and chloro substituent groups in the benzoyl moiety seems to expedite
the transport of these complexes through the cellular membrane/52, 53/.
Figure 6 shows the number of drug molecules bound per base pair (rb) based on different concentrations
of the copper complexes for 2 h of exposure. The complexes Cu(LZ)z and Cu(L3) displayed a higher DNA-
binding activity than Cu(LI). At the concentration range of 20-100 laM, the complex Cu(L3): binds 2 times
more quickly to DNA than Cu(LI)z. These results are in accordance with the cytotoxic activities in vitro
found for these complexes and the differences of binding to DNA that are presented by these copper(II)
complexes may be caused by their lipophylic properties, incorporation rate and their square-planar geometry
/54/.

4. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have prepared the bis-chelate copper (II) complexes from acylthiourea derivatives. The
crystal structure of Cu(LZ)2 shows that the copper atom presents a nearly square-planar geometry with two
bidentate ligands having sulfur and oxygen as donor atoms in cis positions.
In vitro cytotoxic activity tests against the mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 cell line showed that
the copper (II) complexes were more cytotoxic at low micromolar concentrations with respect to the free
ligands. In particular the complex Cu(L3h was able to induce a notable decrease of cell survival with a IC.s(i

value very similar to those of the related platinum (II) complexes tested under the same experimental
conditions. In addition, the complexes Cu(L2)2 and Cu(L3)2 have shown remarkable copper accumulation in
TA3 cells and higher binding to cellular DNA than Cu(L1)2. We hope the present results may be
complemented with other additional biological tests involving the assessment of their cytotoxic effects on
different tumor cell lines, their toxicity in vivo and the biodistribution of these compounds in diverse organs
with the purpose to lead to the development of a new class of antitumor agents.
