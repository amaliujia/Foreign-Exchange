ABSTRACT
Analysis of the LIS data for several series of Ln3+
complexes of C4 symmetry in terms of structural
changes, crystal-field effects and/or variation of hyperfine constants along the lanthanide series was
undertaken using a combination of the two-nuclei and three-nuclei techniques together with the classical one-
nucleus technique. Isostructurality of whole series of complexes, with changes of the Fi, and B02 parameters,
was clearly defined for the complexes of L by the combination of the two first methods. Small changes,
involving the three Fi, G and B parameters, are observed for the series of complexes of L-L4, using the
three data plotting methods. Some of the plots according to the two- and three-nuclei methods are
accidentally linear, without necessarily implying isostructurality of the complexes, as they involve
parameters, which may be insensitive to any small structural changes occurring in these systems. These
parameter variations could result from a magnification, by the present graphical analysis, of the breaks
expected from the gradual structural changes along the series due to the lanthanide contraction. The x and 13
parameters of the three-nuclei method are not diagnostic of the type of structures the complexes have in
solution, due to their very indirect dependence on the geometric factors.

INTRODUCTION
The binding of a ligand to a paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide metal ion, Ln>, generally results in large
hyperfine NMR shifts (LIS) as well as nuclear relaxation enhancements (LIR) at the ligand nuclei, which
have made them ideal structural probes of supramolecular complexes and proteins/1/, while Gd> complexes
have found very useful biomedical applications as contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging/2/. In
particular, the LIS have magnitudes and signs depending critically on both the nature of the Ln3+
ion and the
location of the nucleus relative to the metal center, making them very sensitive to structural changes/1,3,4/.
para
In fact, the observed LIS values, 60. induced by a paramagnetic Ln> ion j upon the NMR signal of a
nucleus i, resulting from the coupling of the electronic magnetic moment ofj with the nuclear magnetic
moment of i, has two contributions/1 c,5-9/, a through-bond Fermi contact (6) and a through-space dipolar
or pseudo-contact shift ( 60d. ), which in an axially symmetric complex (with at least a C3 or C4 symmetry axis)
can be written as/10/:

where F is proportional to the hyperfine coupling constant A of nucleus i, <Sr/is the spin expectation value
for the paramagnetic n Q is Bleaney's factor, a magnetic constant measuring at a given temperature the
second-order magnetic axial anisotropy of the paramagnetic lanthanide j (scaled to -100 for Dy), B is the
axial second-order crystal field parameter of the complex, and G is the axial geometric factor of nucleus i,
[G (3COS20i-1)/r], where r and 0 are the axial polar coordinates of nucleus in the principal axis (z-axis)
of the magnetic susceptibility tensor ofthe complex, with the Ln3+
ion at the origin. Because only the dipolar
term contains the geometric information of interest about the lantanide complex, any quantitative structural
analysis requires a reliable separation of the observed shift into the contact and dipolar terms. An empirical
separation method has been proposed/11/, based on measurement of LIS data for a series of lanthanide
complexes. This one-nucleus technique uses plots based on rearrangement of eq. (1) into two linear forms
(eqs. (2) and (3)):

The LIS separation is then achieved at a fixed temperature with the following assumptions" (1) the

hyperfine coupling constants (A, and hence the F terms) for each nucleus, and the crystal field parameter,
2,are invariant along the lanthanide series. Often plots of the observed LIS data according to eqs. (2) and
(3) are linear along the lanthanide series. Then, F and (B2 G) can be determined by linear regression and the
above assumptions are proven to be valid, in particular that the complexes are isostructural and the crystal
field coefficient is invariant along the Ln3+
series. However, breaks frequently found in such plots near the
middle of the Ln series (Gd-Dy)/lc/have in some cases been ascribed to a gradual change of the G factors
associated with the lanthanide contraction/13/, an effect which is amplified for the heavier lanthanides
because of their large C./ values /6/. However, in other cases such breaks have been assigned to variations of
F and/or Be along the Ln series/14,17/.

Because theoretical <S..> and C./values for some of the lanthanide ions, in particular for Sm and Eu
/5,7,21/, have anomalous temperature dependencies, there is a lack of reliable theoretical <Sz> and C values
for either abnormally high or low temperatures. Thus, although these parameters are relatively independent
from crystal field effects around room temperature, it is desirable to analyze LIS data and to test for
isostructurality of series of lanthanide complexes without recourse to the use of both B of the complexes
and the theoretical <S. and Ci flee-ion parameters. This can be achieved with the three-nuclei method/22/,
based on eq. (5) for three different nuclei i, k, in the same lanthanide complex:

lanthanide series. As it is solely based on experimental LIS data, this method can be applied to any ligand for
which the LIS data are available for at least three nuclei, over a very wide range oftemperatures.
Complementary structural information on the complexes is provided by the experimental relative Ln-Hj

The relative distances obtained by eq. (6) should be independent of the electronic spin relaxation time,
rotational correlation time and magnetic moment ofeach individual complex.
The combined use of the above two-nuclei and three-nuclei techniques together with the classical one-
nucleus technique, according to eqs. (1)-(5), to study the LIS values for a series of lanthanide complexes, is
particularly powerful in assigning eventual structural changes, crystal-field effects and/or variation of
hyperfine constants along the lanthanide series/19,22-26/. A critical study of the results of this approach to
the analysis of LIS data of a series Ln>
complexes of three-fold symmetry (at least a C3 axis) in terms of
structural changes, crystal-field effects and/or variation of hyperfine constants along the lanthanide series,
has recently been undertaken/26,27/. We now extend this analysis to the LIS data available for complexes of
four-fold symmetry (at least a C4 axis) of linear an macrocyclic ligands in different stoichiometries, solvents
and temperatures (see Fig. 1).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
[Ln(RPSz)4] (Lt= RPSz= dithiomethyiphosphinate and dithiophosphate derivatives).
A large number of lanthanide complexes of the [Ln(RzPS2)4] type has been isolated and characterized in
the solid state by X-ray crystallography, where the ligand of general formula RzPS.G with two sulphur donor
atoms, is a dithiophosphinate (eg. R Me) or a dithiophosphonate (R OMe, OEt, OPr)/28-32/. The crystal
structures show the lanthanide ion bound to eight sulphur atoms with coordination geometries ranging
between the regular D2d dodecahedron, favored by alkoxy substituents at the phosphorus, and a dodecahedron
distorted towards the D square antiprism, favored by alkyl substituents. However for each ligand no
('a'los F.G.('. Geraldes el al. Bioninorganic Chemistry and Applications
structural change was observed along the lanthanide series in the solid state.
P and H LIS data have been reported for these [Ln(SzPR)] complexes in CDzCIz solution (Ln Ce-
Yb, except Pm and Gd), at 299 K for all complexes/18,28,32/and also at 233 K for R OEt (SP(OEt)z=
O,O'-diethyl dithiophosphate)/28/. The observed NMR data fit an effectively axial symmetric coordination
model in which the lanthanide ion is chelated by four SzPRz
-molecules in a bidentate fashion (through the
two sulfur atoms). These data were analysed using the usual two-nuclei crystal field independent method/18/
through plots based on a simplified version of eq. (4), where is the P nucleus and k are the CHz and CH
protons and assuming no contact contribution to the LIS values of these protons. In this case, as F 0, the
plots give directly as intercepts the values of the hyperfine coupling constant to the P nucleus, F,, and as
slopes the g.eometric ratios R, G,/Gk. The breaks observed in such plots at the middle of the lanthanide
series for all the compounds studied were assigned to structural (R, values) and P coupling constant (F,)
changes along the lanthanide series, although no differences in solid state structures of the complexes along
the series have been detected/18,28,32/. Large decreases ofF, and R, values were observed from the first to
the second group of Ln ions, indicating a substantial decrease of the contact and dipolar shifts of the P
nucleus, consistent with a change of the coordination .polyhedron in solution from a dodecahedral to a square
antiprismatic structure. We have confirmed the conclusions of these early studies by plotting the LIS data of
the [Ln(SzP(OEt)2)4] complexes at 299 K and 233 K using eqs. (2) and (3)/26/. Indeed, breaks in those plots
were seen at Tb, reflecting variations of the F and BGi terms (Table 1)/26/. The proton F values are very
small, while the F, and R, values indeed decrease drastically at Tb. In particular, the large F, couplings
decrease by about 50% in the second part ofthe Ln series.
Because another early analysis of the same P and H LIS data using a different crystal field independent
method has concluded that the [Ln(SzP(OEt)2)]" complexes are isostructural along the Ln series/14/, we
proceeded to analyse the same data on the basis of the full eq. (4)/26/. The corresponding plots for CH
and k CHz indeed give a single straight line identical at both temperatures, indicating that either there is no
structural change, or if it occurs it is not reflected in the proton G and F parameters, eg. Gc/Gc# is
constant (Fig. 2A). However, similar plots with P and k CH or CH, identical to the ones discussed
above using the simplified version of eq. (4), give clear breaks at Tb, confirming that the F and Gparameters
of the P nucleus change abruptly at Tb (Fig. 2B). There is generally a good agreement of experimental and
calculated R and (F Fk R) parameters (Table 1).
Plots according to eq. (5) with CH, CH2 and k P give a single straight line along the Ln series
(Fig. 2C), with experimental slope (c) and intercept (3) values identical at both temperatures (c 0.366; [3
0) (Table 1). This is not surprising because the temperature-dependent parameters, B, <S and Q., are all
absent from eq. (5). The experimental e and [ parameters are in satisfactory agreement with those calculated
from F and G values obtained by the other methods (Table 1). However, plots according to eq. (5) with
other combinations, such as for P, CH and k CH2, show large breaks, thus confirming the structural
and coupling constants change/26/. The reason why the first plot is not sensitive to the structural change is
that [3 0 implies that Fcm/Fcm Gc#/G,m andtlese ratios do not change along the series. This example
illustrates how both the two nuclei and three nuclei methods.may accidentally not reflect structural and/or F
changes for some of the combinations of nuclei used in the plots. Thus, it is very important to analyse all the
possible combinations.

[Ln(DOTA)(HzO)q] (L DOTA 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N",N'"-tetraacetate)
X-ray crystal structures have been determined for a series of [Ln(DOTA)(HzO)] chelates, which define
nine-coordinated capped square antiprismatic (CSAP) (M) or inverted capped square antiprismatic structures
(m). The acetate arms of the DOTA ligand are arranged in a propeller-like fashion above the basal plane
containing one of the square faces of the coordination polyhedron, made up of the four ring N donor atoms
which encompass the Ln3+
ion, defining with their four O donor atoms the other square face in a parallel
plane above it, thereby generating a C4 symmetry axis in these complexes. The O atom of the inner-sphere
water molecule occupies a capping position. The twist angle between these two square faces can be positive
or negative, leading to the two possible isomers, M and m, in which the macrocyclic rings have the same
conformation and the difference between them is in the layout of the pendant arms. The X-ray structures of
the [Ln(DOTA)(H20)]" complexes with Ln Eu, Gd, Y and Lu are CSAP (M), with twist angles of ca 39
/33-38/, whereas the La complex adopts an inverted CSAP structure (m) with twist angle of ca -22/39/.
The solution structures of these complexes have been intensively studied by NMR. In fact, the H and 3C
LIS values ofthe [Ln(DOTA)]" (Ln La-Lu, except Pm and Gd) complexes have been reported in D20 at pH
7 and different temperatures /40-46/. The H and C NMR spectra exhibit two sets of resonances
corresponding to the presence of two slowly interconverting coordination isomers, one set of resonances
having constantly larger frequency shifts than the other group. The isomer displaying larger shifts was
assigned to a nine-coordinate CSAP structure M, while the isomer displaying smaller shifts is either a nine-
coordinate inverted CSAP m (from La to Ho), or an eight-coordinate inverted SAP m' structure with no

/41,42,45/. It should be noted that the structures determined in the solid state contain two structurally
independent elements of chirality defined by the pendant arm C-C3-N-C and ring N-C-Cz-N torsion angles,
leading to four possible stereoisomers, which constitute two diastereoisomers each with enantiomeric pairs
which are not distinguishable by NMR spectroscopy in solution. The numbering scheme adopted for the
hydrogen and carbon atoms is shown in Fig. 3, which schematically represents part of the structure of the
complexes in one of the enantiomeric forms of the M isomer, where H denotes the pro-R and H6 the pro-S
pendant arm methylene proton/20/.

The H and aC LIS data available for the M, m and m' isomers ofthe [Ln(DOTA)(H2Oq]complexes were
analyzed by plots according to eqs. (2) and (3) /20/. Because Sm was excluded and due to population
limitations, H and aC LIS values ofthe M isomer were available in the first half ofthe Ln series only for Ln
Nd Eu, and aC LIS values for the twisted SAP isomer were limited in the second half of the series to Yb
(m'), limiting any definite conclusion in these eases. However, with the available data, breaks between light
and heavy Ln were observed in most of those plots (Fig. 4), as reported previously/44/, reflecting variations
of the F and BGi parameters. In general, the M isomer shows less significant breaks than m/re'.

The LIS data were also plotted according to eq. (4), eliminating the effect ofany changes of Bo (Fig. 5A)

parameters ofthe two groups (Ce-Eu and Tb-Yb) were evaluated. These breaks are much less significant than
for the one-nucleus plots, not only due to the absence of Bo in the later plots, but also due to the presence of

H4, Ha, H2, C4 and C2. The R and (F-R,F) parameters evaluated directly by eq. (4) agree very well with
those obtained indirectly using the F and B02Gi values from eq. (2)/20/.
Various plots using eq. (5) were also obtained for this system/26/. For the 3C shifts of the M isomer,
some ofthe plots give good linear correlations along the Ln series, eg. for Ca or Ca, C and k C2 (Fig.
5B). Other plots of this type give again a single line along the Ln series, such as for C2, C and k Ca,
but other combinations give more or less pronounced breaks, such as for Ca, C and k C3, and for

C or C3, l C and k C4/26/. This is in agreement with the changes ofFand Gparameters at the middle of
the Ln series detected by the one- and two nuclei methods, and again illustrates the possibility that some of
the plots according to eq. (5) may accidentally be linear without implying isostructurality of the complexes.
In the case of the 3C shifts ofthe m isomer, the data available (Ln Pr, Nd, Eu) gives linear plots within the
first half of the Ln series (see Table 2). lots according to eq. (5) for the H LIS data ofthe M and m isomers,
eg. for H3, H and H6, H and k Ha support these conclusions, showing two linear parts with breaks in
the middle of the series (Fig. 5C). Table 2 compares the c and 13 values calculated for the two isomers,
clearly showing that M has significantly larger values than m/m'/26/. The structural change occurring at Ho
for the inverted SA' isomer, from m to m', involving loss of one hydration water molecule, is not reflected in
any break at Ho in the plots obtained.

[Ln(DOTEA)]3/
(L3
DOTEA 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7,10-tetrakis(N,N-
diethylacetamide))
Although there is no crystal structure available for any of the [Ln(DOTEA)]3+
complexes (DOTEA is the
DOTA-like tertiary tetraethylamide derivative), there are crystal structures available for Ln3+
complexes for
various DOTA-like achiral primary and secondary tetramide derivatives. Some of these structures are m-type
for [La(DOTAM)(H20)]3+/47/and [Eu(DOTAM)(H.O)]3+/48/, and M-type for [Ln(DTMA)(H20)]3+
(Ln
Gd, Dy)/49,50/. However, the m/M isomer ratio for Eu3+
complexes of various DOTA tetraamide derivatives

in solution increases in the order tetraacetate ([Eu(DOTA)]') < primary tetraamide ([Eu(DOTAM)]+) <
secondary tetramethylamide ([Eu(DTMA)]3+) < tertiary tetramethylamide ([Eu(DOTTA)]3+), indicating that
an increasing steric demand at the bound metal ion favors the inverted square antiprismatic structure rn/50/.
H and 3C LIS values are available for the [Ln(DOTEA)]3+
complexes (Ln Ce-Yb except Pm and Gd,
for H, and Ln Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu for 3C) in CDCN solution at 253K, which is present as a single isomer/51/.
These H LIS data were originally analysed using the one-nucleus method, through plots according to eqs. (2)
and (3), which showed breaks at Eu/Tb, reflecting variations of the F and BgGi parameters, while the data
for Tm significantly deviated from the linear correlation defined by the (Tb-Yb) group. The calculated BgG
differed by 30% for the two Ln subgroups, while the F differed by 600%/51/. The H LIS data were also
analysed by comparing the experimental dipolar shit,s, which are equal to the z-axis magnetic anisotropy
C./BGi., with those calculated from the G values defined by MM2-calculated structures ofthese complexes.
The optimal calculated structure was of the M type, and the results further suggested a significant difference
in G values between the light and heavy complexes. However, the derived .B2oGi values for the series of
[Ln(DOTEA)]3+
complexes did not follow the trend of constants, which was interpreted as due to a change
of the B parameter along the Ln series, with the largest value for Tm/51/. However this analysis, which led
to an M-type solution structure of these complexes, is in conflict with the solution structure analysis of the
other tertiary tetraamide complex [Eu(DOTTA)]3+, with a m/M isomer ratio of2/50/.
We reanalyzed these H LIS data, as well as the 3C LIS data (R Pr, Nd, Eu, excluding Sm) for the
[Ln(DOTEA)]3+
complexes, through plots according to eqs. (2) and (3) /20/ and using the H5 and H6
assignments of Fig. 3, leading to some reassignments of the original data/51/. Again breaks were observed at
Eu/Tb in most of those plots, reflecting variations ofF and BG /20/. The data were also plotted according
to eq. (4) (Fig.6A), showing again much smaller (H, H6 << Ha < H, H3.), but still significant breaks at

(methylenephosphonate))
The crystal structure of the [Tm(DOTP)]s"
complex describes the Tm3+
coordination polyhedron as an
inverted square antiprism, m', with the four ring nitrogens defining one of its square faces and the four
coordinated phosphonate oxygens defining the other one/52/. Structurally very similar to the [Ln(DOTA)]"
complexes, except for the absence of inner-sphere water molecules, it also has a C symmetry axis. The H,
aC and 31p LIS for the paramagnetic [Ln(DOTP)]" complexes (except Ln Pm, Gd) (where DOTPs"
is the
tetakis(methylenephosphonate) analog of DOTA) have been reported at 298 K in DzO at pH 10 /53/,

showing only one isomer in solution (M' or m'). Water 70 NMR shiit measurements of [Dy(DOTP)]"
confirmed that this complex lacks an inner-sphere water molecule /16/. The highly charged anionic
[Ln(DOTP)]" complexes have four protonation steps over the pH 3-10 range, leading to significantly pH
dependent LI.S values/54/. Thus, besides pH 10, the LIS values at pH 7 and 3 were also analyzed/20/. These
four protonations correspond to the four residual negative charges localized on the phosphonate oxygen
atoms, which are directed away from the Ln coordination site, while the fifth charge, which is averaged over
the four bound oxygens in the coordination cage, is not titrated in this pH range.
The H, aC and aP LIS data (pH 10) were initially analysed through the one-nucleus technique. Shift
data plots according to eqs. (2) and (3)/53/showed breaks at Eu/Tb, reflecting variations of F and BGg.
Systematic deviations were again .observed for Tm and Yb from the linear correlations defined by the other
ions within the second half ofthe series. The H LIS data were also analysed by considering B02 constant and
comparing the experimental G values and Ln-H distance ratios obtained from T relaxation data, with the
corresponding values derived from MMX-calculated structures of these complexes, giving an optimal fit for
an M'-type structure, in disagreement with the crystal structure/53/.
Because these contradictory structural results might originate from the assignments of the methylene
protons of the pendant arms, in a recent reinvestigation, the H and H6 protons were reassigned to be in
agreement with the convention of Fig 3, and the H and C LIS data available for the [Ln(DOTPHn)](4)
complexes at pH 10, 7 and 3 were reanalyzed/20/. Plots according to eqs. (2) and (3) again showed breaks at
Yb, due to F and BgGi changes/20/. Plots according to eq. (4) again show smaller (Hs, H6 << H4, C3 < H2,
Ha, C2, P) but significant breaks at Tb, indicating changes of F and R at Eu/Tb/20/. An earlier analysis of
the H, 13C and aP LIS data for the [Ln(DOTP)]" complexes within the second half of the series (Ln Tb-
Yb) /16/ using Reuben's crystal-field parameter independent method/14/gave evidence that these complexes
are isostructural (G and F constant). It also showed that the deviations in the plots according to eqs. (2) and
(3) is otten observed in the (Tb-Yb) half series, in particular for Tm and Yb, reflect large changes of Bg,
with the largest value for Tm and the smallest for Yb/16/.
Fig. 7A shows the 3P/3C LIS data plotted according to eq. (5) for P, l C and k C2, where all data
points (n=l 1) fall on a straight line. The aC LIS data of C3 when plotted in the same way (i P, C and k
Cz ) also show a good linear relationship/26/. The c and 13 values obtained directly from these plots agree
quite reasonably with those calculated from the F and B{G parameters obtained from eq (2)/26/. However,
like for the complexes of DOTA and DOTEA, plots using other nuclear combinations give more or less
pronounced breaks, such as for Ca, C and k C3, and for C2 or C3, C and k C4. This is again
in agreement with the detected changes of F and G parameters at Eu/Tb, and illustrates the appearance of
accidentally linear plots according to eq. (5). These conclusions are supported by plots of the H LIS data
according to eq. (5), obtained for Hz, Ha, H and H6, H and k H4. While the plots are reasonably
linear for H and H6 (Fig. 7B), they show large deviations from linearity for H2 and H (see c and 13
values at Table 2)/26/.
Due to the conflicting conclusions from the structural analysis in solution and in the solid state for some
3+
of the tetraazamacrocyclic complexes studied ([Ln(DOTEA)] and [Ln(DOTP)]), described above, we
compared the experimental proton structural parameters, Rk (dipolar shift ratios) and (rj/ru) (Ln-H
distance ratios) with those calculated from M/M" and m/m' structural models in the four systems studied (M

and [Ln(DOTP)]5")/20/. The Rk/ratios are quite constant for
the ring protons in all complexes, while the differences between the M/M' and m/m' structures occur in the
H5 and H6 protons of the peodant arms. Very good agreement of experimental and calculated data was
obtained for the M and m [Ln(DOTA)] isomers (also with the X-ray results) and for the [Ln(DOTEA)]3+
complexes in the M form. For the [Ln(DOTP)]5"
complexes, the reassignment of H5 and H gave optimal

agreement for the m' solution conformation, in accordance with the X-ray crystal structure/20/. A similar
comparison, using the experimental Yb-H distances normalized to H1 (rHj/rHl) obtained from the proton TI
relaxation times in the literature/41,51,53/and eq (6), with those calculated from M/M" and m/m' structural
models, confirms the above conclusions. The Yb-Hi distances of H5 and H6 in the M/M' and m/m' forms
differ quite substantially: while H5 is closer to Yb than H6 in M, their distances to Yb are about the same in
m/m'. The experimental results for the [Ln(DOTA)] M and rn/m' isomers agree very well with the predicted
values, the experimental results for the [Ln(DOTEA)]3+
complex agree with an M form in solution, and the
experimental data for [Ln(DOTP)]5
also agree with the values calculated for a m' form/20/.
It is worth noting that comparison of the c and 13 values, obtained from plots of the H LIS for the CH2
protons in the pendant arms ofthe three complexes according to eq. (5), for H5 and H6, with H1 and k
H4 (Table 2), is not diagnostic of their structure being either M/M' or m/m', although these structures only
differ in the arrangement of the pendant arms around the metal ion. The c and 13 parameters do not reflect
those structural changes, probably as a result of their very indirect structural dependence on the Rill4 (i H5
and H6) geometric ratio (eq. (5)), mixed with a dependence on the geometric ratio, RH1H4, and the F ratios,
Sill and SHIH4 which significantly change in the different complexes. This reduces the structural diagnostic
power ofthe three nuclei method based on eq. (5)/20, 26/.
ILn(PHT)] (L PHT phtalocyanine).
Several X-ray crystallographic studies on Nd3+/55/and Lu3+/56/sandwich complexes of Ln3+
ions with
two phtalocyanine (PHT) macrocyclic conjugated rings have been carried out (H [Nd(PHT)2]' [N(n-Bu)4]]
[Lu(PHT)] and H [Lu(PHT)z]) These solid-state structures are very similar, with the Ln+ eight-coordinated
by the isoindole nitrogen atoms of the two PHT rings in quasi square antiprismatic geometries (D4a
symmetry), with the two stacked phtalocyanines staggered.
The H NMR spectra of the [N(n-Bu)4]] [Ln(PHT)z] (Ln Pr-Lu except Pro, Gd) complexes in CD3CN
solution at 298 K show only one Ht and one H resonance of the phtalocyanine rings, indicating that the
complexes have a C4 axis in solution/57/. This is compatible with a D4t, square prismatic or a D4d square
antiprismatic geometry, depending whether the two stacked phtalocyanines are eclipsed or staggered, or fast
interconversion between the two. Data from the UV-vis absorption spectra of the Ln Pr, Lu complexes in
CD3CN solution excluded the D4 structure/57/. The LIS values of the H and H protons in the paramagnetic
complexes were analysed through plots according to eqs. (2) and (3), showing breaks at Eu/Tb and also
significant deviations from linearity within each of the two Ln subfamilies, reflecting variations of F and
BgG (Fig. 8A)/26/. In the original work, BgG values were identified with G and single F and G values
were obtained for Hi and H2 along the lanthanide series/57/which did not fully agree with our analysis/26/.
Fitting of the geometrical dependence of the experimentally derived Rik ratios to a chemical model of the
[Ln(PHT)] complexes based on the crystal structures ofthe Nd and Lu compounds gave an average distance
between the two rings in the sandwich compound of 2.54 ,and an average Ln-N distance of 2.31 ,&/57/.
However, the data analysis available does not prove isostructurality in solution.
Thus, we studied the same data using the two-nuclei crystal-field independent technique, eliminating the
effect of any B02 changes, and a plot according to eq. (4) (i H2 and k H) gives a single straight line along
the lanthanide series (Fig. 8B)/26/. This confirms that the complexes are isostructural, with change of B02

CONCLUSIONS
The considerable success of the classical one-nucleus crystal-field dependent method in the separation of
para
experimental 60. values for axially symmetric lanthanide complexes into their contact and dipolar
contributions is somewhat limited in its structural information due to the observation of data scatter or breaks
in the corresponding plots according to eqs. (2) and (3)) often seen for many systems. The resulting large
statistical errors in Fi and BGi values obtained by the method often preclude any reliable quantitative study
of the structural and bonding properties ofthe respective lanthanide complexes. In particular, the BG term
obtained cannot be used for detecting structural G changes because it is affected by any variation of the
crystal-field parameter Bo2
along the lanthanide series /lc/. The two-nuclei technique (eq. (4)) /18,19/,
independent of Bo2
is a reliable method to study the isostructurality of a series of lanthanide complexes. The
linearity of the corresponding experimental plots is a proof of isostructurality of the complexes, due to the
constancy of their slopes Rk=(G/Gk) and intercepts (F-FkR,), and therefore of the geometric terms G and
hyperfine coupling constants F. The combined use of the one- and two-nuclei techniques allows us to
conclude if the changes of B02G reflected by breaks of plots using the first method result from changes of
B02 G or both/20/. The three nuclei shift ratio method (eq (5))/22/has some advantages in the analysis of
the isostructurality of lanthanide complexes, as it is based exclusively on the experimental shift data,
requiring no knowledge of B, <S or C values, and thus can be applied to the shift data measured at any
temperature, as long as the data are available for at least three nuclei within a given ligand. However, the cz
and 13 values of the plots obtained are complicated functions of F and G ratios rather than of their values,
which may reduce or magnify in some cases the effects of Ln3+
contraction on F and G parameters. It also
cannot provide quantitative values for F and G.
The combined use of the three methods gives new insights for the solution structural study of a series of
lanthanide complexes on the basis of the measured LIS values, as shown by a recent critical analysis of the
LIS data for several series of Ln3+
complexes of C3 symmetry in terms of structural changes, crystal-field
effects and/or variation of hyperfine constants along the lanthanide series/26,27/. In the present study, this
approach was extended to a series of linear and macrocyclic Ln3+
complexes of C4 symmetry, at different
temperatures, solvents and pH values. None of the systems studied showed constancy of the three F, G and
B02 parameters for the whole series of lanthanide complexes, but isostructurality was proven, with change of
F and Bo2 for the complexes of L ([Ln(PHT)2]') using the one- and two-nuclei methods. Sudden variations
of the F, G and B( parameters at Eu/Tb were observed for the series of complexes of all the other ligands
studied, L-L4. Breaks in plots according to the two-nuclei method were generally smaller than for the one-
nucleus method, as the geometric term ratios R,=(G/G,) tend to be less sensitive than the geometric terms
Gi to the structural changes that may occur. For some particular combinations of nuclei, the plots according
to eqs. (4) and (5) are accidentally linear, without necessarily implying isostructurality of the complexes, as
they involve parameters insensitive to the structural changes which may occur. This illustrates the need to
analyse as many plots as possible, as conclusions based on a small number of plots may be wrong. The
changes involving the three F, G and B( parameters were interpreted as reflecting small distortions of
dodecahedral towards SAP structures (L,[Ln(S2PR2)4] complexes) or small geometric changes within SAP
and inverted SAP structures (L2, [Ln(DOTA)]; L3, [Ln(DOTEA)]3+; L4, [Ln(DOTP)]5). These observed
20
(i'arlos F.G.C. Geraides el al. Bioninorganic Chemistry andApplications
changes of the parameters could also result from a magnification, by the present graphical analysis, of the
breaks expected from the gradual structural changes along the series due to the lanthanide contraction/13/.
The structural change occurring for the [Ln(DOTA)] isomer with an inverted SAP structure, from m to m' at
Ho, involving loss of one hydration water molecule, is not reflected in any break at Ho in the plots obtained.
The various and [3 parameters, obtained from plots according to the three-nuclei method for the
tetraazamacrocyclic complexes, were found not to be diagnostic of their structure being either M/M' or
m/m'. They do not reflect such structural differences, due to their very indirect dependence on the relevant
geometric terms.
