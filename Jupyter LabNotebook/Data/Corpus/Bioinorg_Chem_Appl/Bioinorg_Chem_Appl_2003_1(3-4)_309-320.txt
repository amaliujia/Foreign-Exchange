ABSTRACT
A number of diorganotin(IV) complexes with Schiffbase have been synthesized and characterized by
elemental analysis, conductance measurements, molecular weight determinations, infrared, electronic and
multinuclear magnetic resonance (1H, 3C and 119Sn NMR) spectral data. The molar conductivity data shows
non-electrolytic nature of complexes. The bidentate nature of the ligands is inferred from IR and NMR
spectral studies. The antimicrobial activities of the ligands and their tin complexes have been screened in
vitro against the organism Escherichia coli; Staphylococus aureus, Prouteus mirabilis, Bacillus
thurengiensis, Penicillium co.,sogenum, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium oxysporum.
Keywords: Dibutyltin oxide, heterocyclic aldehydes/ketones, organotin(IV) complexes, spectral studies,
microorganism.
INTRODUCTION
Organotin compounds show a large spectrum of biological activities. In recent years, several investigators
to test their antitumour activity /1,2/ have been carried out. It has been observed that several organotin
complexes are effective antifouling, /3/ antmicrobial /4/ and antiviral agents, therefore, much attention has
been paid to their implications for antioncogenesis/5/. They are also used commercially as bactericides,
fungicides, acaricides and industrial and agriculture biocides/6,7/. The pronounced biological activity of the
metal complexes of Schiff bases derived from sulpha drugs has led to considerable interest in their
coordination chemistry. The condensation products of sulpha drugs with aldehydes and ketones are
biologically active and also have good complexing ability; their activity increases on complexation with
metal ion/8-11/. Keeping this in view, it was considered worthwhile to synthesize organotin complexes of
some stereochemical as well as biological importance. During the course of the present investigations, an
attempt has been made to synthesize organotin complexes by interacting Bu2SnO and Schiff bases derived by

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and solvents used were dried and purified by standard methods /12/ and moisture was
excluded from the glass apparatus using CaCI2 drying tubes. Melting points were determined in open
capillaries and are uncorrected.
Preparation of the Schiff Bases
The Schiff bases were synthesized by the condensation of 2-hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde, o-
hydroxyacetophenone and salicylaldehyde with sulpha drugs, viz. sulphanilamide and sulphamerazine, in 1"1
molar ratio using ethanol as the reaction medium. The solution was refluxed on a water bath for 4-5 h and
then allowed to cool at room temperature. The crystalline solids were separated out and purified by
recrystallization from the same solvent. The main characteristics and analytical data are recorded in Table-1.
Preparation of Organotin(IV) Complexes
Organotin(IV) oxide was added to the calculated amount of Schiff base in a 1:2 molar ratio in dry
benzene as reaction medium. The contents were refluxed on a fractionating column for about 24 hours. The
water liberated in the reaction was removed azeotropically with benzene. On completion of the reaction, the
resulting products were rendered free from solvent and then washed repeatedly with dry cyclohexane. The
crystalline solids were separated out and purified by recrystallization from the same solvent. The products so
formed were finally dried in vacuum at 40+5 C for 2-3 hours. The purity of the compounds was checked by
TLC using silica gel-G as adsorbent. Their physical properties and analytical data are recorded in Table 2.

Analytical Methods and Spectral Measurements
Tin was estimated gravimetrically as SnO2. Nitrogen and sulphur were estimated by Kjeldahl's and
Messenger's methods, respectively/13/. Molar conductance measurements were made in anhydrous DMF at
36+1 C using a Systronics conductivity bride-305. Molecular weight determinations were carried out by the
Rast camphor method. The electronic spectra were recorded in methanol on a Toshniwal spectrophotometer.
Infrared spectra were obtained on a Nicolet Magna 550 FTIR spectrophotometer as Nujol mulls as Cs!
window or KBr discs. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer RB-12 spectrometer in CDCI3 using
TMS as internal standard at 90 MHz. 13C and 119Sn NMR spectra were recorded on a 90 MHz Jeol Fx-90 Q
NMR spectrometer in CHCI3 using TMS as an internal standard and TMT as an external standard at 22.8 and
22.7 MHz, respectively.
Antibacterial Test
In vitro antibacterial activity of the ligands and the complexes was tested using the paper disc diffusion
methods/14/at a concentration of 100 ppm. Streptomycin was used as reference compound for antibacterial
activities. E. coli, S. aureus, Bacillus thurengiensis and P. mirabilis were used as the test organisms.
Antifungal Activity
In the radial growth method, the medium (.potato, dextrose, agar and distilled water) and fungi were
grown at 28+2 C. The compounds were mixed in 50, 100, 200 ppm concentrations in the medium. The linear
growth of the fungus was obtained measuring the colony diameter after 9 h and the average ot: three
replicates of growth in mm was considered. The amount of growth inhibition was calculated by the equation
given by Vincent/15/:
% inhibition (C-T) x 100/C
C diameter of fungus colony in control plate
T diameter of fungus colony in test plate
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reaction of organotin(IV) oxides with the Schiff bases of sulpha drugs with the elimination of water,
which was removed azeotropically with benzene:
Bu2SnO + 2NOH / Bu2Sn(NO)2 + HO
where NOH represents the Schiffbases of Sulpha Drugs

The above reactions are quite thcile and could be completed in 22-24 hours of refluxing in benzene and
removing the liberated water azeotropically. All these newly synthesized complexes are coloured solids and
are soluble in DMF, DMSO and partia?, soluble in common organic solvents. The conductance of these
complexes has been recorded in DMF at room temperature in the range 8-20 ohmcm tool,suggesting their
non-electrolytic nature. The molecular weights of the complexes de..,mined by the Rast camphor method
correspond with formula weight, indicating their monomeric nature. I'he physical characteristics of these
complexes are given in Table 2
Electronic Spectra
The UV and visible spectra of Schiff bases exhibit two intense absorption maxima at 246 and 390 rim.
The band at 246 nm is assignable to -* (benzenoid) transitions which are shifted towards the lower energy
region (266 nm) in the spectra of tin complexes. Such a bathochromic shift may be due to an increase in the
availability of the lone pair of electrons on the auxochromic oxygen, as the intramolecular H-bonding
initially present in the ligand ceases after the deprotonation of the OH group on complexation. The bands at
390 nm in the spectra of the ligands are due to n-* transition within the >C=N chromphore. An appreciable
blue shift in these bands is observed in the spectra of the tin complexes and it may be attributed to the
coordination of azomethine nitrogen to the tin atom.
Infrared Spectra
In the IR spectra of the ligands, a strong band in the region 1610+10 cm assignable to v(C=N) /16/ is
shifted to the lower frequency side (15 cm-) in the spectra of the tin complexes, indicating coordination
through the azomethine nitrogen to the tin atom/17,18/. The spectra of these derivatives do not show any
bands in the 2770 cm regions which could be assigned to the hydrogen bonded v(OH) vibration originally
present in the ligands. This indicates complexation with the tin atom. Medium to strong intensity bands
appear at 1260 cm and may be assigned to the phenolic C-O stretching mode. This band is slightly shifted
to the higher frequency side (-1285 cm-) in the spectra of the tin complexes, showing chelation of the
phenolic oxygen to the tin atom.
The appearance of new strong to medium intensity bands is observed at 550 cm and 600 cm-,which
may be assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric mode of v(Sn-C)/19/, stretching vibrations in the spectra
of tin complexes and also two bands at 530 +/- 10 and 410+ 12 cm-1 may be assigned to v(Sn-O) /20/ and
v(Sn+-N) /21/ vibrations, respectively, indicating the participation of azomethine and phenolic oxygen in
complexation.
IH NMR Spectra
The H NMR data of ligands and their organotin(IV) complexes have been recorded in CDC13 (Table 3).
In the H NMR spectra the ligands show a signal at 5 12.35-13.16 ppm for the hydrogen bonded plenolic

protons. These signals completely disappear in the complexes, indicates that the chelation ofphenolic oxygen
to the tin atom. In the case of the ligands the proton signal for the methyl protons [-C(CH3)=N] and
azomethine protons [-CH=N] in the region i-1.88 ppm and 15-8.95 ppm, respectively, shifts downfield in
the spectra of corresponding tin complexes ( -0.10 ppm) on account of its deshielding, which is attributed to
the donation of the lone pair of electrons by the azomethine nitrogen to the tin atom. The ligand shows a
complex multiplet in the region fi -7.90-6.80 ppm for the aromatic protons which remains at almost the same
position in the spectra of the organotin(IV) complexes. The complexes, however, show additional signals at
5 ~0.75 1.95 ppm owing to the protons ofthe butyl group.
13C NMR Spectra
The 3C NMR spectral data for salicylaldehyde sulphanilamide, 2-hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde
sulphanilamide, o-hydroxyacetophenone sulphanilamide and its corresponding tin complexes are reported in
Table 4. The shifting in the position of resonance of carbon attached to OH group suggests the bonding of
oxygen to the tin atom. Further, the shifting of azomethine (>C=N-) carbon signal in the spectra of
complexes as compared to the ligands clearly indicates that the azomethine moiety has been involved in
coordination. The carbon of the butyl group is observed at (5-26.5, 27.4,-26.2,-14.0 ppm) position
comparable to other similar compounds. The R group attached to tin displays resonance for chemically
equivalent carbon; however, the butyl compounds display three resonance. The tin-carbon coupling nJ(9Sn-
C) values of n=l, 920 Hz; n=2, 40.5 Hz; and n 3, 125.8 Hz indicate the six coordinate around tin in such
organotin(IV) complexes.
119Sn NMR Spectra
The Bu2Sn(|V) complexes give sharp signals at-5-350.2 ppm, in 19Sn NMR spectra, which strongly
supports the six coordination around tin in a distorted octahedral geometry. Values/22-24/for similar six
coordinated BuSn(IV) complexes have been reported in the range of6 -265 to -365 ppm.
On the basis of the observed spectral evidence, the following tentative structures with (probably distorted)
octahedral geometry can be proposed:

Antimicrobial Results
All the complexes were tested against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The results listed in
Table 5 show that all the complexes were active against gram positive bacteria while less active against E.
coli, which is gram negative.
The results further show that complexes having hydroxy naphthalene nucleus were more active then
salicylaldehyde or hydroxyacetophenone Schiff base counterparts. This is in accordance with the well
established view that the naphthalene nucleus possessing-OH group increases the activity of a compound
/25/. Further, the tin complexes are more active as compared to the ligands, which indicates that metallation
increases the activity/26,27/. All the compounds tested (Table 6) were found to be highly active against
penicillium crysogenum, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium oxysporum. The activity was highly marked in case
ofA. niger, the growth of which was maximally inhibited at 100 ppm concentration is the some compounds.
The high activity of these complexes may also be explained as the basis of the fineness of their particles,
which is an important factor for the biological activity. The above studies clearly indicate that the tin
complexes synthesized in the present studies are highly active against all these pathogens.
