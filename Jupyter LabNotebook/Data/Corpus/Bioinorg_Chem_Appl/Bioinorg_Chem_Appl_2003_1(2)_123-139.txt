ABSTRACT
Copper(II) complexes of amino acids and peptides containing the chelating bis(imidazolyl) residues have
been reviewed. The results reveal that bis(imidazolyl) analogues of these biomolecules are very effective
ligands for metal binding. The nitrogen donor atoms of the chelating agent are the major metal binding sites
under acidic conditions. In the presence of terminal amino group the multidentate character of the ligands
results in the formation of various polynuclear complexes including the ligand and the imidazole bridged
dimeric species. The most intriguing feature of the coordination chemistry of these ligands is that the
deprotonation of the coordinated imidazole-N(1)H groups results in the appearance of a new chelating site in
the molecules. It leads to the formation of stable trinuclear complexes via negatively charged imidazolato
bridges.
Keywords: amino acids, peptides, bis(imidazol-2-yl)methane, copper(II), stability constants
INTRODUCTION
Imidazole nitrogen donor atoms are among the most common metal binding sites in metalloenzymes. The
metal ion coordination generally takes place via the N(1) or N(3) atoms of imidazole residues as it is
represented by a great variety of iron, zinc and copper proteins including myoglobin and other heme proteins,
carbonic anhydrase, carboxypeptidase and blue copper proteins. Another group of metalloenzymes, however,
contains the imidazole moiety as a bridging ligand; e.g. in CuZn-superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), where
both nitrogen atoms ofthe negatively charged imidazolato residue take part in metal binding..
The monodentate coordination of imidazole side chains is generally modelled by the metal complexes of
peptides containing histidyl residues. A great number of studies have been performed in this field and the

Chelating bis(imidazolyl)Residues
most important observations have already been reviewed by several authors/1-5/. The results of these studies
reveal that the presence of histidine in peptides significantly enhances the metal binding ability of the
ligands, but the extent of the increase in stability and the structure of the various complexes largely depend
on the location ofhistidyl residues in the peptide chain.
The metal complexes of synthetic ligands containing two or more imidazole residues are also frequently
used to mimic the structure and catalytic activity of the active sites of metalloproteins/6-8/. These molecules
can provide a high structural variety for metal ion coordination including both the monodentate and bridging
imidazolyl coordinations. The ligand bis(imidazolyl)methane (BIM) is one of the simplest representatives of
polyimidazole ligands, but it is a very strong chelating agent and its amino (BIMA) and carboxylate (BIP)
derivatives can be easily attached to amino acids or peptides via amide bonds. The copper(ll) complexes of
these amino acid and peptide analogues containing the bis(imidazol-2-yl)methyl residues have been studied
in our laboratories in the last few years/9-15/. In this survey we would like to give a brief account of the
most important results of these studies. The data clearly represent that these synthetic derivatives of amino
acids and peptides are very effective ligands for metal binding and their complex formation processes can be
finely tuned by the location ofthe monodentate and chelating side chains ofthe parent biomolecules.
EXPERIMENTAL
The synthetic procedures for the preparation of ligands have already been reported elsewhere/9-16/. The
purity of the derivatives of amino acids and peptides was checked by TLC and HPLC and their structures
were proved by H NMR measurements.
The protonation constants of the ligands and the stability constants of the copper(lI) complexes (log
for [CupHqL,.]) were determined by potentiometric titrations in aqueous solution, under standard conditions.
Experimental details of the pH-metric measurements and calculation of the equilibrium parameters have been
reported previously/14,15/. The structures of the various species formed in solution and the metal binding
sites of the ligands were elucidated by UV-VIS, EPR, NMR and CD spectroscopic and MALDI-MS studies.
The applications of these experimental techniques are discussed in the original publications/9-15/.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Selection of the ligands
The parent ligand bis(imidazol-2-yl)methane (BIM) is a well known chelating agent forming stable, 6-
qnembered chelate rings with a series of transition elements /17-20]. The amino (BIMA) and carboxylate
(BIP) derivatives of BIM (see Scheme !) made it possible to link the chelating agent to the C- or N-termini of
peptides via the formation of an additional amide bond. The resulting ligands contain the characteristic metal
binding sites of both the peptides and the chelating agent BIM. Taking into account the fact that the
coordination ability of amino acids and peptides is significantly influenced by the presence of the terminal

amino group and the coordinating side chain residues the synthetic analogues of the original biomolecules

It is clear fi'om Table that the protonation of the nitrogen atoms of the bis(imidazolyl) residues always
takes place in the acidic pH range and the presence of other protonation sites decreases the basicity (or pK
values) of these nitrogen donors. As a consequence, the parent compound (BIM) has the highest pK values
and the amino group in the close vicinity of the bis(imidazolyl) residue has the most significant influence on
the basicity of the nitrogen donor atoms. In the case of BIMA only one pK value of the bis(imidazolyl)
moiety lies in the measurable pH range (pK > 1.5), while in all other cases the differences in the basicities of
the two nitrogen atoms are around 2 log units. It is also important to note that in the case of ligands
containing terminal amino group and especially a third imidazole from histidyl residues the protonation
equilibria of the 3 or 4 nitrogen atoms significantly overlap. The exact assignment of the protonation sites
would require the determination of protonation microconstants. These values have not been determined yet,
but the pH-dependent H NMR studies on the ligand His-BIMA unambiguously revealed that the order of
basicities ofthe 4 donor atoms follow the trend: N(Im) of BIM < N(lm) of His < N(amino).
Formation of 4N-coordinated complexes
The results obtained for the copper(II) complexes reveal that the bis(imidazolyl) residues are the primary
metal binding sites in the case of all ligands. The complex formation reactions generally start in strongly

protonated under these conditions and the stoichiometries of the various bis(imidazolyl)-coordinated species
can vary between [CuLl and [CuH_L], and [CuL2] and [CuH4L2] for the mono- and bis-(ligand) complexes,
respectively. The overall stability constants of these complexes (log [3pq,) have been reported in the previous
publications/9-15/, but these values cannot be easily compared, because of the different protonation sites of
the ligands. In Table 2 the log K' and log K'2 values are summarized, which represent the metal ion
coordination of one or two bis(imidazolyl) residues and can be obtained from the overall stability constants
by substracting the pK values of the non-coordinated donor functions. The last column in Table 2 contains
the ratio of the stability constants (Iog(K/K2)) of the species [CuL] and [CuL_]. In the case of BIM, Ac-
ProLeuGly-BIMA and BIP-lleAlaGiy-OEt the two ratios, log(K'/K'2) and iog(K/K_) are the same because
extra protonation sites are not available, while the change of these values reflects the change of coordination
geometries in all other cases.
It is clear from Table 2 that the ratios of the stability constants ofthe 2N- and 4N- coordinated complexes,
log(K'/K'2), are around two log units in all cases. For the same coordination modes exact agreement of these
values cannot be expected because there can be some differences in the pK values of the side chain donor
functions of the free and coordinated ligands. The existence of the same coordination mode of the
bis(imidazolyl) residues is, however, clearly supported by the spectroscopic parameters of the various
bis(ligand) complexes. The absorption maxima of the [CuH,L_] complexes are always in the range ;k

can be observed in the parallel region of EPR spectra/9/for all species listed in Table 2 in agreement with
the coordination of four equivalent nitrogen atoms as shown by Scheme 6.

The comparison of the log(K'/K'2) and Iog(K/K2) values in Table 2 reveals that the deprotonation of the
non-coordinated donor functions of the ligands significantly influences the ratios of stepwise stability
constants in most cases. These processes are generally accompanied by drastic changes of spectral
parameters, suggesting the appearance of new coordination modes. In the case of amino acid and dipeptide
derivatives these values cannot even be determined, because the deprotonation of the non-coordinated
ammonium group is accompanied by the deprotonation and metal ion coordination of the amide functions
and the species [CuL] and/or [CuL2] do not exist in measurable concentrations. For the terminally protected
tripeptides containing His(imidazolyl) residues the deprotonation of the side chain donor functions can be
easily followed and generally results in an increase in the ratio of stepwise stability constants. This can be
explained by the tridentate coordination of the ligands in the species [CuL], which enhances the
thermodynamic stability of the 1:1 complexes, but slightly suppresses bis(ligand) complex formation. It is
also clear from Table 2 that the tridentate coordination is more preferred if the chelating agent is present at
the N-termini (peptides of BIP). In the case of C-terminal derivatives (peptides of BIMA) the ratio of the
stepwise stability constants increases as the distance between the chelating and monodentate side chains
increases. As a consequence, the most stable 1:1 complex was obtained with BOC-HisLeuGIy-BIMA and the
outstanding stability of this species was explained by the equatorial coordination of the histidyl residue in the
form of 16-membered macrochelate as shown by Scheme 7.

The tridentate nature and the equatorial coordination of the ligand is supported by the change of the
spectral parameters, too. The formation of [CuL] from [CuHL] is accompanied by a significant blue shift of
absorption maxima (from 685 nm to 635 nm) in the copper(II)-BOC-HisLeuGly-BIMA system. The
variation of EPR parameters reveals similar tendencies: gll- 2.27 and 2.30 and All- 176 and 172 x 10--4
cln
-for [CuL] and [CuHL], respectively.
Deprotonation of the bis(ligand) complexes, namely the formation of [CuL2] from [Cull,L2] is
accompanied by the opposite change of spectral parameters. For example, in the case ofthe copper(lI)-BOC-
HisLeuGly-BIMA system the deprotonation of the histidyl residues resulted in a 41 nm red shift of
absorption spectra (from 595 nm to 636 nm) and a small decrease of EPR hyperfine coupling constants (from
197 x 10-4
cm
-to 191 x 10-4
cm-). These parameters are in agreement with the axial coordination of at least
one of the side chain histidyl residues in the [CuL2] species. Similar spectral changes were observed for all
other ligands and both the thermodynamic and spectral data suggest that the extent of axial coordination
increases with the increase of the distance between the chelating bis(imidazolyl) and monodentate histidyl
side chains. It is also important to note that extra deprotonation reactions were not observed in the copper(lI)
complexes of any N-protected tripeptides. As a consequence, the bis(imidazolyl) agents are the primary metal
binding sites of these ligands at all pH values, but the side chain donor functions may enhance the metal
binding ability ofthese ligands via equatorial or axial coordinations.
Ligand and/or imidazole bridged dinuclear complexes
The presence of the terminal amino groups in the bis(imidazolyl) derivatives of amino acids and
dipeptides makes the complex formation processes of these ligands much more complicated than those with
the terminally protected ones. This is demonstrated by Figure where the speciation curves obtained in the
copper(II)-Gly-BIMA, His-BIMA and GlyLeu-BIMA systems are plotted in equimolar solutions.

It is clear from Figure that the deprotonation of the non-coordinated ammonium groups results in the
formation of various dinuclear complexes in slightly acidic solutions in all cases. In the case of His-BIMA
and the dipeptide derivatives, the stoichiometry of the first dimeric species is [CuzL2] suggesting that the
amide nitrogen atoms are not yet metal binding sites in these species. The formation of [CuzL2] is
accompanied by a blue shift of absorption maxima and the appearance ofbroad, unresolved EPR spectra. The
species are not EPR silent, but the line broadening suggests a dipolar interaction between copper(II) ions and
the presence of a mixture of copper(II) ions with different coordination environments. These spectral changes
can be explained by the assumption of the structures shown by Schemes 8.a,b and 9.a,b for His-BIMA and
dipeptide-BIMA systems, respectively.

Vol. 1, No. 2, 2003 Copper(ll) Comt)lexes ofAmino Acids and Peptides Containing
Chelating bis'(imidazolyl)Residues
Both His-BIMA and dipeptide-BIMA ligands contain two, separated chelating sites in the molecules: the
bis(imidazolyl) sites and the (NH,His(Im)) or (NHz,CO) sites, respectively. Steric requirements rule out the
coordination of these chelating sites to the same metal ion in a mononuclear complex, but the formation of
ligand bridged dimeric complexes is possible in all cases. Two different isomeric forms of [CuzL2] can be
obtained by these types of coordinations. Schemes 8.a and 9.a correspond to the symmetrical arrangement of
the donor sites, while 8.b and 9.b to the asymmetrical ones. Previous results on the factors influencing mixed
ligand complex formation/21/indicate the preference of symmetrical isomers and it is further supported by
the results ofthe EPR measurements. The spectral parameters ofthe individual coordination modes cannot be
determined, because of the high similarity of the overlapping species, but the observation of the
superhyperfine splitting in the parallel region is a strong indication of the symmetrical coordination of the
chelating sites.
An increase of pH results in the formation of another dinuclear complex with the stoichiometry of
[Cu2H_zL]. This species was formed with all amino acids including Gly-BIMA and Phe-BIMA and dipeptide
derivatives, except AlaPro-BIMA. Taking into account the pH range of deprotonation (pH < 5) and the blue
shift of the absorption maxima, the extra base consuming process cannot be hydroxo complex formation, but
it should come from the deprotonation and metal ion coordination of the amide functions of the molecules.
The spectral parameters obtained for the [Cu_H_2Lz] species of the bis(imidazolyl) derivatives of dipeptides
and amino acids are significantly different, suggesting different metal binding modes. In the case of
copper(ll)-GlyLeu-BIMA system (or the other dipeptides) the shift of the absorption maxima from 627 nm
to 546 nm upon the formation of [CuzH_zL_] from [CuzLz] clearly indicates the increase of the number of
coordinated nitrogen atoms. It can be best explained by the conversion of the (NH,CO) chelate to the
(NHz,N-) chelate in the same ligand bridged structure as shown by Scheme 9.a,b. The species [CuzH_2L2] was
not formed in the case of AlaPro-BIMA containing the secondary amide bond between Ala and Pro residues
and this observation provides further support that the amide nitrogen next to the amino groups takes place in
metal binding in these species.
In the case of the copper(ll)-amino acid-BIMA systems (Gly-BIMA, Phe-BIMA and His-BIMA) the
absorption maxima of the species [Cu2H_2L2] occur at 590+5 nm and the EPR spectra are characteristic of
dimeric copper(II) complexes with relatively short copper(ll)-copper(ll) distances. These parameters can be
explained by the tridentate, [NH2,N-,N(lm)]-coordination of each iigand containing a bridging imidazole
residue at the fourth equatorial coordination site (Scheme 10).

The EPR parameters obtained from the perpendicular signals of the spectra made it possible to calculate
the Cu-Cu distances in the dinuclear species and the values 390, 393 and 397 nm were obtained for Gly-
BIMA, Phe-BIMA and His-BIMA, respectively.
Complexes with negatively charged imidazolato residues
The increase of pH results in one or two more extra base consuming processes above pH 7 in all types of
systems depicted in Figure 1. The stoichiometries of the various species and the binding sites of the ligands
are, however, significantly different in th.e three cases. For copper(II)-Gly-BIMA (or Phe-BIMA) systems the
deprotonation and formation of [CuH_zL] were explained by hydroxo complex formation, which is followed
by precipitation of metal hydroxide at high pH values. These observations suggest that the bridging imidazole
residues are not able to prevent hydrolytic reactions in alkaline solution. However, in the case of the
copper(II)-His-BIMA system the EPR spectra provided an unambiguous proof for the existence of dimeric
complexes at any pH values in the basic range. The stoichiometries ofthese dinuclear species can be given as
[CuzH_3L2] and [CuzH_4L2] and their formation is accompanied by a slight blue shift of the absorption band
(from 592 nm to 565 nm). The Cu-Cu distance can be calculated from the perpendicular signal of EPR
spectra at pH 10.4 and a small decrease ofthis value (from 397 pm to 384 pm) was obtained. The changes of
these parameters strongly support the deprotonation of the pyrrole type N(1)H group of the coordinated
imidazole functions. The deprotonation results in a negatively charged imidazolato group and its metal
binding is generally accompanied by a slight decrease of metal-ligand bonds and blue shift of the absorption
maxima of copper(II) complexes. Metal ion induced deprotonation of the imidazole-N(1)H groups have
already been reported for many peptide complexes containing histidyl residues/22-28/. Palladium(II) and
gold(III) were reported to be especially effective in the promotion of ionisation/26-28/, while pK values
around 10 were reported for copper(II) complexes /22-25/. The pK values obtained for the successive
deprotonation of the complex [Cu2H_2L2] of His-BIMA are 8.13 and 8.93 /14/. These values are slightly
lower than those reported for copper(II) complexes in the literature, but these species have different charges
and the charge neutralization probably has a significant contribution to the outstanding thermodynamic
stability of the species [CuzH_4L2]. It is also important to note that, in principle, similar deprotonation
reactions could occur in the copper(II)-Gly-BIMA or Phe-BIMA systems, too. In the case of these ligands
the extra deprotonation reactions were, however, interpreted by the hydrolysis of the metal ions. The
differences between the reaction of His-BIMA and the other two amino acids probably can be explained by
the weak axial interaction of the side chain histidyl imidazole donor groups. This axial interaction enhances
the metal binding ability of His-BIMA and, at the same time, suppresses the chance ofhydrolytic reactions.
The dipeptide derivatives of BIMA contain two amide functions which are in the position to form joined
chelate rings with the terminal amino and bis(imidazolyl) nitrogen donor atoms. As a consequence, the
dinuclear complex [CuzH_zL2] is transformed to a mononuclear copper(lI) species [CuH_zL] above pH 7 in
equimolar solution. This complex predominates in the pH range 8 to 10 and its spectral parameters are in a
very good agreement with those of the 4N-coordinated peptide complexes of copper(II) /29/. The absorption
maxima of the [CuH_2L] complexes of GlyLeu-BIMA, LeuGIy-BIMA and PheGIy-BIMA were measured at
) 513-514 nm and the EPR parameters were obtained as follows: gll 2.174 to 2.178 and All 204 to 205 x

Another base consuming process takes place above pH 10, which may correspond to the deprotonation of
the N(1)H group of the coordinated imidazole. The pK values of this process are 10.69, 10.75 and 10.51 for
GlyLeu-BIMA, LeuGIy-BIMA and PheGIy-BIMA, respectively. These values are higher than those reported
for the same process of His-BIMA, but in the case of the dipeptides the deprotonation results in negatively
charged species, while even the final species [CtlzH_4L2] is neutral for His-BIMA. The deprotonation
reactions are accompanied by small changes of spectral parameters, e.g.: k 508 nm, gll- 2.168 and All

-were obtained for the [CuH_L] species of LeuGIy-BIMA supporting that the 4N-
coordination mode remains intact in the species [CuH_L] (see Scheme 11.b).
The multidentate character of the dipeptide ligands made it possible to bind more than one metal ion and
it is important to note that the N(1)H deprotonation creates a new chelating site, too. As a consequence,
precipitation was not observed even in slightly basic solution up to 2:1 Cu(II):L ratio and the formation of
various polynuclear complexes was suggested. It is clear from Figure that the species [Cu:H_L],
[Cu.H_6L] and [Cu4H_L2] are the major polynuclear complexes in alkaline solutions and their formation is
represented by Scheme 12. Following the binding of the second amide group in [CuH_:L] the imidazole
nitrogen atoms get to a sterically favourable position which promotes the deprotonation of a pyrrole type
N(1)H group resulting in the formation of [CuzH_,L] species (Scheme 12.a). It is also clear from the structure
of [CuzH_L] that the coordination sphere of one metal ion is not saturated yet, and this results in formation
of tri- or tetranuclear complexes depending on the metal to ligand ratio. At 3:2 metal to ligand ratio the
trinuclear complex [Cu.H_6L2] predominates above pH 7, in which all copper(ll) ions are coordinated by 4 N
donor atoms (Scheme 12.b), while at 2:1 metal to ligand ratio a mixed hydroxo complex [CuH_sL:] is
formed connecting the [Cu:H_.L] moieties via hydroxo bridges (Scheme 12.c).

The existence of the trinuclear complexes was supported by MALDI-MS spectroscopic measurements,
too. The mass spectra were reported in a previous publication /15/ and they unambiguously prove the
presence of three copper(If) ions in the complex formed at pH 8 in solution containing copper(II) and
LeuGIy-BIMA ligand at 3 to 2 ratio. The isotope distribution pattern obtained for the complex is in very good
agreement with that calculated for the molecule ion [Cu3H_6L2]H+
[Cu3C30H4004NI4]H+. There is a
difference, however, between the estimated (M([Cu3C30H4004Na]H+) 852.3) and measured (M 855.3)
molecular weights, which correspond to the uptake of three protons. The higher values for the measured
molecular weight could be explained by the reduction of Cu2+
to Cu+
during the MS ionization and flight

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The results obtained for the copper(ll) complexes of amino acids and peptides reveal that bis(imidazolyl)
analogues of these biomolecules are very effective ligands for metal binding. The nitrogen donor atoms of
the chelating bis(imidazolyl) residues are the major metal binding sites under acidic conditions (Scheme 6)
and they remain the exclusive metal binding sites if the terminal amino group or an effective side chain donor
function are not present in the molecules. The high thermodynamic stability of the metal complexes of the
bis(imidazolyl) ligands render these ligands as potential enzyme inhibitors. Moreover, specific enzyme

inhibitors may be obtained by attaching the bis(imidazolyl) ligands to the preferred peptide sequence for the
enzyme cleavage.
The terminal amino group can be considered as another anchor for metal binding with these ligands. The
multidentate character of these ligands results in the formation of various polynuclear complexes including
the ligand bridged dimeric species (Scheme 8 and 9) and the imidazole bridged dimeric species (Scheme 10).
These complexes can be considered as interesting structural models of the various dinuclear species of
transition elements.
Finally, the most intriguing feature of the coordination chemistry ofthese ligands is that the deprotonation
of the coordinated imidazole-N(1)H groups results in the appearance of a new chelating site in the molecules.
It leads to the formation of stable trinuclear complexes via negatively charged imidazolato bridges and these
species can be considered as promising structural and/or functional models ofvarious metalloenzymes.
