Background
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme is
critically important for protecting erythrocytes from oxidative
stress and intravascular hemolysis. G6PD is an X-linked gene
encoding the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP), a NADPH-producing dehydrogenase. Because
erythrocytes do not generate NADPH in any other way than
PPP, they are susceptible to oxidative damages. G6PD
deficiency is a prime example of a hemolytic anemia due to an
interaction between an intra-corpuscular and an extra
corpuscular cause. In the majority of cases, an exogenous agent,
such as an exposure to oxidant stress triggers hemolysis 
[].
G6PD gene is located at the telomeric region of the X
chromosome (band Xq28), consisting of 13 exons and 12 introns.
It encodes 515 amino acids and a GC-rich (more than 70%)
promoter region. G6PD-deficient erythrocytes are more
susceptible to destruction by oxidative stress than normal
erythrocytes due to the lower NADPH levels []. Individuals
with this genetic defect may exhibit non-immune hemolytic
anemia in response to a number of stimuli, most commonly
infections or exposure to certain medications or chemicals 
[].
G6PD is X-linked, and so deficient variants are expressed more
commonly in males than in females. Worldwide, an estimated
400 million people are G6PD deficient with the distribution
corresponding to areas in which malaria is, or has been,
prevalent. There is some evidence that hemizygous males may
be protected against severe malaria [].

In 1994, Bertina et al described a common variation (G1691A) in
the Factor V Leiden (FVL) gene as a molecular defect
responsible for activated protein C (APC) resistance, a
previously unrecognized mechanism of inherited
thrombophilia. FVL gene variant is caused by a single point
mutation at nt1691, leading to the replacement of arginine at
position 506 in the APC cleavage site of factor Va by glutamine.
This mutation represents one of the most important risk factors
for inherited thrombophilia (Mozafari H et al., 2009). A
nucleotide transition at G20210A in the 3'untranslated region of
the prothrombin (PRT or FII) gene was associated with nearly a
25% increase in plasma thrombin activity and a 2.7-fold
increased risk for venous thrombosis. G20210A is associated
with increased plasma levels of PRT. It is the 2nd most common
inherited risk factor for thrombosis [,
]. The FVL (G1691A)
and PRT (G20210A) mutations are 2 such examples; each has
been found to be associated strongly with spontaneous and
recurrent venous thromboembolism. Similarly, a thermolabile
variant of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an
enzyme involved in the folate-dependent metabolism of
homocysteine, increases the risk for deep vein thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism. MTHFR is a key enzyme in folate and
homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. A single point mutation
causing a C-T substitution at nucleotide 677 and from the
valine to alanine in the enzyme of the MTHFR gene has been
associated with a thermolabile enzyme form of low biological
activity. C677T MTHFR polymorphism is associated with low
folate and vitamin B12 levels. The role of high total Hcy serum
or plasma levels received considerable interest after these
factors were implicated as an important risk factor for vascular
and several other diseases. The three single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are most recognized as predisposing to
thrombosis are FVL mutation (G1691A), PRT mutation
(G20210A)) and MTHFR variant (C677T).

Although studies performed on epidemiology, genetics and
molecular biology have broadened the information on G6PD
deficiency; there are still no reliable and validated methods to
test drug hemolytic potential in G6PD deficient patients 
[]. In
our study we have confirmed the G6PD individuals by G6PD
determination test which is a hematological test and later on we
have performed molecular test with PCR-RFLP followed by 2%
electrophoresis. We have chosen to screen for the FVL
(G1691A), PRT (G20210A) and MTHFR (C677T) mutations. The
FVL and the PRT gene mutations are associated with increased
risk of venous thromboembolism and possibly myocardial
infarction and stroke. The MTHFR mutation increases plasma
homocysteine, which has emerged as a potential risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases. We aimed to assess the role of these
SNPs (i.e. Thrombophilic mutations and MTHFR C677T) as
they play any risk factors for G6PD deficient individuals among
Saudi population.

Methodology
A total of 61 patients among which G6PD deficient individuals
was 39 and were recruited from different institutes like Central
blood bank, Driver school blood bank (DALLA) and King
Abdul-Aziz specialist Hospital in Taif city in West region of
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the period of July 2011 to
Aug 2011. They were compared with 22 normal subjects
without any complications and 6ml samples was collected in
EDTA anticoagulated tubes and 4ml of the sample was used for
hematological test to confirm the G6PD deficiency for G6PD
determination test and G6PD deficiency using fluorescent spot
test (Boehringer Mannheim GmGH, West Germany). 2ml of the
EDTA sample was used for the identifying the molecular
analysis. Institutional ethical committee approval and informed
consent was obtained from all the subjects included in the
study. The inclusion criteria of G6PD deficiency were to include
male donors. All types of G6PD were excluded using a
questionnaire that was female. Fluorescence is produced due to
reduction of NADP to NADPH. This reaction is coupled with
oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconate and
catalyzed by G6PD. Specimens with G6PD activity of less than
20% of normal do not fluoresce, as the small amount of NADPH
formed is re-oxidized by the glutathione present in the reagents.

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples
according to a standard protocol described elsewhere (Norgen,
Germany). DNA was dissolved in TE Buffer (~100ng/µl DNA
concentration) and stored at-80°C until further process. The
genotype analysis was performed at the Department of clinical
laboratory sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King
Saud University, Riyadh and Saudi Arabia. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was carried out to determine the Thrombophilia
genotyping of 3 genes (FVL-PTR-MTHFR) was performed by
using PCR-RFLP and specific primers as shown in the 

(see supplementary material) were chosen from the reference
[] 
studies. Primers were synthesized by Bioserve technologies,
Hyderabad, India).

Statistical Analysis:
linical characteristics of all the subjects were expressed as
mean± SD. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS
program. Allele frequencies were calculated by gene counting
method. P values&lt;0.05 were considered significant, &lt;0.01 highly
significant and &lt;0.0001 extremely significant. Odds ratios were
also calculated for the samples.

Result &amp; Discussion
In this study 39 G6PD deficiency male individuals were
included. The age range was started from 17-50 years with a
mean age of 33.5+9.96. It was seen that G6PD individual's blood
groups were A, B and O of both positive and negative blood
groups and none of the G6PD individual were having both AB
positive and negative blood groups.  (see
supplementary material) shows the individuals participated in
the study with their blood groups.:
G1691A allele and genotype frequencies:
To genotype G1691A the 241bp PCR product was obtained,
which on digesting with HindIII restriction enzyme give
fragments of 241bp indicating GG, 241/209/32bp indicating GA
and 209/32bp indicating AA genotype. In the G6PD deficiency
group, the GG (100%) and none of the genotype (GA and AA)
were present. In the control group GG genotype was found to
be 95% and GA was found to be 5%. No statistical analysis have
shown any association with either allele or genotype
frequencies OR=0.566, p=.0.667, (95% CI=0.014-22.48) and
OR=0.569, p=0.251¸ (95% CI=0.014-22.96).

G20210A allele and genotype frequencies:
A 345bp wild type PCR product of G20210A was digested with
HindIII restriction enzyme to generate a fragment of 322bp
which is a mutant type and heterozygotes are expected to have
both the fragments. Complete GG (100%) genotypes were
present in both the cases and control. GA and AA were
completely absent in all the samples. No significant evidence of
association was observed for any of the phenotypes
investigated with G6PD cases. For G Vs A, p=0.774; OR=0.566
(95%CI; 0.011-29.6); AA+GA Vs GG; p=0.502; OR=0.569
(95%CI=0.010-2969). G and A allele frequencies were similar
between cases and controls with no statistical significance.

C677T allele and genotype frequencies:
The frequency of MTHFR C677T mutant allele (T) was highest
in our study when comparing with G1691A and G20210A
mutations. The C677T PCR product was obtained to be 198bp,
later on digestion with HinfI restriction enzyme give the
fragments of 198bp indicating CC, 198/175/23bp indicating CT
and 175/23bp indicating TT genotype. The frequencies of
C677T CC, CT and TT genotypes among G6PD deficiency males
were 74.4%, 23% and 2.56% respectively. The percentage of T
allele was 14.1% and C allele was 85.9%. G6PD cases were
compared with the normal subjects and the distribution of CC,
CT and TT genotypes was 77.3%, 22.7% and 0%. TT genotype
was absent in the control groups. The allele frequency of control
subjects of C and T allele was 88.6% and 11.4%. We have
compared the C677T cases with the controls. None of the
genotypes or allele frequency cannot show any association
OR=1.281, p=.0.667, (95% CI=0.414-3.958) and OR=1.1.172,
p=0.800¸ (95% CI=0.343-4.008). Similarly, the difference of T
allele frequencies between patients and controls was not found
any association.  (see supplementary material) shows
the Genotypes and Allele frequencies of FVL, PRT and MTHFR
genes involved in this study.

The G6PD deficiency is one of the commonly occurring genetic
enzyme disorders known to affect millions of individuals
worldwide and an increased risk for venous thrombosis. It is
linked to the Mediterranean basin. In G6PD deficiency males
may be either G6PD normal or deficient hemizygotes, whereas
females may be normal homozygotes, deficient homozygotes,
or heterozygotes. In the G6PD gene 13 exons were present and
complete genetic sequencing analysis were conducted in the
Saudi Arabia individuals. Till now there are no studies were
conducted on other gene polymorphisms apart from G6PD
gene. In our study we have conducted thrombophilic gene
mutational studies to rule out whether G1691A, G20210A and
C677T mutations may play any role in G6PD individuals.

FVL is a point mutation which impairs the proteolytic
degradation of the factor V by protein C that makes it active for
a long time. This abnormality of the hemostasis system is
associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. The
prevalence of the mutation varies among different populations,
being high in Europeans and almost absent in the populations
of Southeast Asia, Polynesia and Africa. The largest population
study among Europeans revealed a mean frequency of 2.78%
with a peak value of 12% in Cyprus with decreasing frequency
from south to north and from west to east. 11% of the
prevalence in G6PD deficiency was found in the Dalmatian
population. In an Iran the prevalence rate was 2.5% and in our
population this mutation was completely absent in the G6PD
deficiency [].

Prothrombin, the precursor of thrombin is a vitamin Kdependent
glycoprotein that plays a central role in blood
coagulation. Activated by factor Xa, thrombin converts
fibrinogen to fibrin. The prothrombin (PRT or FII) gene is
located on chromosome 11 near the centromere, spans
approximately 21 kb, and is composed of 14 exons and 13
introns, PRT G20210A represents a gain-of-function mutation
which affects the 3'-terminal nucleotide of the 3' untranslated
region (UTR) of the mRNA. PRT is the second most common
cause of familial thrombophilia is a mutation in the 3'
untranslated region of the PRT gene (G20210A). This mutation
leads to an elevated level of prothrombin because of increased
synthesis but does not lead to an altered aminoacid sequence or
altered function []. Elevated levels of prothrombin occur due
to increased cleavage site recognition, increased 3' end
processing and increased mRNA accumulation and protein
synthesis. Resistance to activated protein C secondary to hyper
prothrombinemia has also been reported.

The prevalence of this gene variant varies widely worldwide,
being virtually absent in Africa, Asia, and natives of America,
while being common in Europe. In the general European
population the prevalence has been reported to range from
0.7% to 4%, and 5.5% in the UK. In contrast, PRT or factor II
G20210A was found in only one of 441 African Americans and
was absent among Japanese subjects. In unselected patients
with venous thrombosis, the prevalence ranges from 4% to 8%.
Abu Amero et al 2002 studies have shown that 1.7% prevalence
rate for G20210A mutation in the Saudi Arabia. Their sample
size of overall study was 1206 which is almost all 20 times more
than our samples and this were not from G6PD deficiencies. In
our study heterozygotes and mutants were completely absent
and it indicates that the person who had can be prone for the
disease. G20210A mutation had no role in the G6PD deficiency.

MTHFR gene is having a genetic factor to contribute in the
thrombotic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease.
MTHFR is involved in the one-carbon cycle, which is of
importance for nucleotide synthesis and methylation of DNA,
membranes, proteins and lipids. Most common MTHFR gene
polymorphisms are C677T and A1298C. Mutations in this gene
result in a decrease of the enzyme activity that leads to mild
hyperhomocysteinemia. A study from Szczeklik A et al
suggested mutations in this gene for allele C677T and A1298C
to be a tendency to associate with coronary artery disease
(CAD), in both homozygous and heterozygous carriers even
when blood homocysteine levels were not elevated 
[&amp;
].

The frequency of MTHFR gene mutations varies between
different population and also among racial and ethnic groups.
In our study group the frequency was found to be 2.5%. In the
Europeans the frequency of mutant T allele is 18.6%, Asian
Population is 20.8%, 32.2% in an American population, 6.6% in
an African population, 4.7% in an Australasian population and
29.1% in the Iran population []. The association between this
variant and venous thromboembolism/CAD has been
controversial. The frequency of T allele in our healthy
population was found to be (0 %) when observed in European
(18.6%) or the Asian population (20.8%) and lower than in the
American population (32.2%). Higher prevalence of mutant T
allele (29.1%) existed in G6PD deficient individuals in an Iran
compared to healthy population, but was not statistically
significant when compared with our study.

Our results indicate that none of these prothrombotic gene
mutations are important risk factors for G6PD deficiency in the
Saudi population. It indicates that these mutations cannot be
used to identify patients with hematological disorders and our
results are not consistent with previous findings in the Mozafari
H et al studies from the western region of the Iran in an Arab
population. We cannot completely rule out the possibility of an
association in an Arab population. First, although this is a
relatively small study of these mutations in this G6PD deficient
male population, the sample size is still limited and the
confidence intervals relatively wide. Secondly, confounding
from other prognostic variables may have played a role. To our
knowledge only one study from Iran has studied G6PD
deficiencies with thrombophilic genes and this study also does
not investigated prothrombin gene mutations are risk factors
for G6PD deficiency. We cannot find any significant trend
toward a higher risk of G6PD deficiency among patients who
were carriers of the prothrombin gene mutations selected in this
study.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our finding indicates that the prevalence of
G1691A, G20210A and C677T mutations in G6PD deficient
individuals is not statistically different compared to normal
subjects and G6PD is not associated with these thrombophilic
mutations in Saudi Arabia also. These could be due to the small
sample size. Our study suggests that large sample may be
required to rule out the disease.
