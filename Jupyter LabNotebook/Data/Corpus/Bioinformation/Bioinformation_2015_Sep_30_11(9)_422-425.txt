analysis capabilities. The web based user interface is created using R programming language powered by Shiny package. This web
interface helps in creating interactive genome visualization based on user provided data selection along with selective data
download options.

Availability
SinRio is available to download freely from Github - https://github.com/NFMC/SynRio or 
from http://www.nfmc.res.in/synrio/. In addition an online version of the platform is also hosted at nfmc.res.in/synrio, using shiny server (open source
edition) installation.

Background
In recent years, cyanobacteria have acquired more attention in
the field of drug discovery as they source natural products
[1,
2]. The cyanobacterial model organism-an autotrophic
prokaryote-Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been widely used in
various genomic and transcriptomic studies for many years, to
generate in abundance, a variety of genome level data sets
which are now getting connected to better understand this
organism. There are many databases available which gather
genome wide information about this bacterium (Example:
Cyanobase [3], KEGG 
[4] etc.) and here is our attempt to
represent this model cyano genome data with simple plotting
functionality utilizing R programming language. As R is more
suitable for such tasks of combining user defined data
modification with filtering and effective graphical plotting, we
chose this programming language to build our cyano genome
interface. In addition, for a cyanobacterial researcher without
programming experience using R for data analysis pose a
greater challenge, since R has a steep learning curve. With a
simple web-based GUI, we are lessening this hurdle and
highlighting the biological content to the researchers for better
data analysis. The Shiny package from R studio is a latest
introduction in R programming for developing web interfaces.
To our advantage, Shiny and Shiny server packages provided
us a great opportunity to design a minimalistic but dynamic
web based platform. Here we introduce “SynRio”: a simple
frame-work which leverages dynamically the power of R with
web server functionality of Shiny for interactive exploration of
model cyanobacteria. We hosted a working version of SynRio at
www.nfmc.res.in/synrio, using a remote web server with shiny
server setup. Shiny server installed in ubuntu server is backing
the R web interface. The session based user interactions are
included in the framework design and are handled smoothly by
Shiny package.

In addition to the Shiny package, we utilized some of the other
R packages to enrich SynRio suite. All necessary packages are
installed from CRAN [5] and Bioconductor 
[6] sites like:
Circlize for constructing circular genome plot; Biostrings for
sequence manipulations; Rgraphviz for network analysis and
seqLogo for PWM ploting. In addition ShinyBS package is
utilize for web interface betterment. The genome sequence and
gene based annotations are downloaded from NCBI site.
Additional gene based and sequence based annotations are
collected from various published resources and freely usable
datasets.

Installation of standalone version
To run SynRio from Github, install shiny package in R with
additional packages like graph, Rgraphviz, shinyBS, circlize,
Biostrings, shinyIncubator, seqLogo. Then run a tar or zip file
directly like below:
runUrl(“https://github.com/NFMC/SynRio/archive/master.tar.gz”)
runUrl(“
https://github.com/NFMC/SynRio/archive/master.zip“)
Or you can clone the git repository, then use runApp()
Alternatively, from here:
runUrl(“http://www.nfmc.res.in/SynRio/archive/master.tar.gz“)
runUrl(“http://www.nfmc.res.in/SynRio/archive/master.zip“)

Methodology
SynRio is developed using Synechocystis PCC 6803
chromosomal sequence and gene based annotations. The webbrowser
based interface is almost completely designed using R
programming language [7] with Shiny package 
[8]. As the first
step, the genome coordinates with start and end positions
should be considered to draw genomic visualization using
genome browser option button and then selection of the gene(s)
or extraction of genome sequence is possible using utility
features. The selected list of genes can also be made as a subset
to be used for different analysis, like: gene clustering based on
COG, KEGG; network construction based on protein-protein
interactions; gene upstream region analysis etc (Figure 1).

Program input:
There are two different ways in which the genomic data can be
accessed. Firstly, by specifying the user start and end genomic
positions, a simple genome browser can be launched to
visualize genomic region and further genes can be extracted
from the selected genomic range (Figure 1A). Secondly, the
user gene list (Synechocystis gene ids) can be uploaded directly
into the tool for getting the annotation or for performing other
advanced analyses (Figure 1B).

Utility:
In addition to its genome visualization capability, SynRio is
also helpful in annotating and analysing the gene ids which are
uploaded into it, using data upload feature. As an example,
with a minimal list of genes associated with carotene
biosynthesis [9], 
Table 1 (see supplementary material), we
tried to find a set of common features present among them.
Abiotic stress based clustering feature along with COG
clustering showed some similarity among the genes for
salt/osmotic and high-light stress, when compared to other
stress types (Figure 2E, F). Also, the -500 gene upstream region
of all these genes was searched for high light-responsive
element 1 (HLR1 element “KTTACAWW”) [10] using pattern
search utility. Interestingly, the HLR1 pattern is found partially,
in almost 7 genes out of 8 selected Table 2 (see supplementary
material) which needs more investigation. In addition, a
pattern: “GGCGATCGCC” - a known and highly repetitive
region of the genome, is also enriched in upstream region of
most of these carotene biosynthesis genes.

Program output:
All the data/result tables from different panels are
downloadable as .txt or .csv.

Features:
A Genome Browser with detailed navigation and zooming
options. The selected genomic region could be highlighted with
gene features and further colour coded using Cluster of
Orthologous Groups (COGS) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG) based gene annotation specifications
(Figure 2A). A simple pattern search tool is incorporated to
perform genome wide DNA pattern identification. In addition,
the gene set selected based on user specification can be
clustered based on COG, Gene Ontology or grouped as
network based on protein-protein interactions (Figure 2B, C).
Finally, a gene cart to choose specific set of genes from different
panels including browser or data upload panel can be used to
download the selected data with mapped annotations or can be
reused to perform chosen gene set analysis. There are
accessory tools like circular plot, which is helpful in advanced
genomic visualization (Figure 2D). A detailed help section is
included to guide the navigation and analysis steps.

Conclusion
SynRio helps to visualize cyanobacterial genome with known
gene dataannotations. It also helps to perform gene or sequence
based analysisdeveloped using R programming and Shiny
package.
