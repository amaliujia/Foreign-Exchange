Background
Cellulose is a highly unbranched polymer consisting of glucose
residues linked together by β-1, 4-glycosidic bonds with
cellobiose as its structural unit. The glucose chains in cellulose
are tightly packed to form insoluble crystallite which is
impenetrable to any molecules including water.The structure of
lignocelluloses is very complex where cellulose forms a skeleton
which surrounded by hemicelluloses and lignin like matrix
compose. Cellulose is one of the most abundant polysaccharide
compound in nature and is thought to be a promisingly
renewable biomass resource for alternative fuels 
[]. The
cellobiose unit in cellulose structure can be further degraded
into glucose monomer unit by cellulases through enzymatic
hydrolysis. There are three major enzymes in cellulase system
that work in synergy to hydrolyze cellulose into glucose
monomer which are endocellulase (endo-1,4-β-
glucanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.4), exocellulase (1,4-β-D-glucan
cellobiohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.91) and β-glucosidase (β-1,4-
glucosidase, EC 3.2.1.21). The biodegradation process of
cellulose starts by endocellulase by cutting randomly at β-1,4-
glucosidic linkages in the cellulose by endocellulases producing
various lengths of oligosaccharides with the new chain ends.
This action eventually breaks down the crystalline structure of
the cellulose. Then, exocellulase cleaves the reducing and nonreducing
ends of this new oligosacarides chain generating either
glucose (glucanohydrolases) or cellobiose (cellobiohydrolase) as
the major products. Finally, β-glucosidase completes this
process by hydrolyzing the remaining cellobiose or cellotetraose
into glucose monomer unit. Cellobiose which is an intermediate
product is also a strong inhibitor for endoglucanase and
exoglucanase and it becomes one of the key bottlenecks in
enzymatic hydrolysis. In order to prevent this inhibition
process, cellobiose unit must be immediately removed. Thus, it
is important to understand the catalytic activity of β-glucosidase
in order to improve the efficiency of this enzyme. This will help
in designing an enhanced β-glucosidases. However, little is
known about the catalaytic interactions between β-glucosidase
and cellobiose. By employing molecular docking simulation, the
binding modes between enzyme and substrate can be further
explored.

Methodology
Preparation of Protein structure:
β-glucosidase B (BglB) from Paenibacillus polymyxa from
Family 1 glycosidase hydrolases (GH-1) was chosen and its
crystal structure was obtained from Protein Data Bank
(http://www.rscb.org) 
with PDB IDs 2O9R []. The protein
consists of one single chain and 452 residues length with
resolution 2.30Å. The quality of structure was evaluated using a
global QMEAN scoring function [] and PROCHECK 
[] was
used to assess the stereo-chemical properties of the polypeptide
structure. Waters, cofactors and originally bounded ligand in
BglB was removed from the original PDB file. Polar hydrogen
atoms were added and Kollman charges, atomic solvation
parameters and fragmental volumes were assigned to the
protein using AutoDock Tools [].

Preparation of ligand structure:
The structure of cellobiose (CBI), cellotetraose (CTT) and
cellotetriose (CTR) were sketched and cleaned using gradient
optimization after adding explicit H-atoms using Marvin Sketch
5.10.2 (ChemAxon) software. Obminimize utility script of
OpenBabel 2.3.1 [] was used to minimize ligands molecule
using MMFF94 forcefield. The prepared ligands were used as
input files for AutoDock 4.2 5.The ligand rigid roots were
automatically set and all possible rotatable bonds and torsions
were defined as active.

Docking Procedure:
The computational docking was performed in machine running
Intel Core Duo processor with 4GB RAM and 500GB hardick.
The ligand centered maps were generated by AutoGrid
program with a spacing of 0.375 Å and dimensions of 60 × 60 ×
60 points. The gridbox centre was set to coordinate 66.14,
28.0619 and 38.081 in x y, and z respectively. The default
settings were used for all other parameters. Lamarckian genetic
algorithm (LGA) method was employed in this docking
simulation []. For each docking simulation 100 different
conformers were generated and were clustered into group with
RMSD lower than 2.0Å. The clusters were ranked by the lowest
energy representative for each cluster. The conformer with
lowest binding energy was chosen and been analyzed for
hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction using LigPlot
[]. For the estimated binding energy (kcal/mol), the inhibition
constant (Ki) for each ligand was calculated.

Result &amp; discussions
From the docking simulation, the best conformation complexes
were selected from 100 docking poses namely BglB-CBI, BglBCTT,
and BglB-CTR.  (see supplementary material)
shows the AutoDock binding free energies (ΔGb, kcal/mol) and
inhibition constant (Ki , µm) for the three complexes. Cellobiose
gives the highest score followed by cellotetraose and
cellotetriose. The view of binding sites of each complex is
shown in . The detailed interactions between betaglucosidase
and each ligands was further analyzed using
LigPlot in order to reveal the key residues involved in the
binding process. The results indicated that each ligands
interacted with beta–glucosidase by forming hydrogen bonds
and hydrophobic interactions as shown in .

Results showed that the binding pocket of BglB mainly formed
by residues Asn166 , Glu356 , Glu167 , Gln22 , Glu409 , Ala411 ,
Trp123 , Tyr123 , Tyr298 , Trp410 , Trp410 , Trp412 , His181 ,
Trp412 , His181, Trp402, and His122. Cellobiose is stabilized by
BglB residues via both hydrogen bond and hydrophobic
interactions. Ten hydrogen bonds were observed in the BglBCBI
complexes as shown in  (see supplementary
material), involving residues Glu356, Asn166, Glu167, Gln22,
Glu409, and His181. While, another seven hydrogen bonds
reported in BglB-CTT complex interacting with residues Gln22,
Trp 402 , Glu409 , His181 and Glu180 , and hydrophobic
interactions were formed by Trp413 , Glu356 , Cys170 , Asn223,
Tyr298 , His181 , Thr178 , Leu174 , Phe246, Ile173 , Tyr169,
Tyr328 and His122. As for BglB-CTR complex, the residues
involve in forming hydrogen bonds cellotetriose were Trp402,
His181, Glu409, and Glu180. While, His122, Asn166,Trp123,
Glu356 , Glu167 ,Cys170 , Trp412 , Cys170 , Trp412 , Trp410 ,
Ala418 , Tyr169 , Leu174 , and Arg243 were found to formed
hydrophobic interaction with the complex.

It has been reported that Glu167 act as a protonated agent of
interglycosidic oxygen atom in hydrolysis mechanism, Glu356
act as nucleophilic in stabilizingthe transition state and Glu409
as catalytic residue []. In agreement with Isorna et al 
[], it is
observed in BglB complexes through hydrogen bonding to this
three glutamate residue in cellobiose binding. Interestingly,
Glu409 was found to form hydrogen bond involve in hydrogen
bond in all three complexes suggesting that this residue might
play as essential role in pathway of enzymatic hydrolysis. This
glutamate residue is highly conserved among family glycoside
hydrolase 1 []. The glutamate side-chain can adapt its position
to an axial O4 and have ability to recognize galacto-configured
substrates due to its conformational freedom characteristic 
[].
In other study, Tiwari et al [] reported that glutamate is
important in reducing the energy barrier of the glycosylation
step.

Conclusion
In this study the binding modes between beta-glucosidase with
cellobiose, cellotetraose, cellotetriose and thio-cellobiose
complexes was explored. From the results, there is nonbonded
interaction exist between the complexes namely hydrogen bond
and hydrophobic contacts. The binding affinities of the
complexes BglB-cellobiose, BglB-cellotetraose, and BglBcellotetriose
are reported to be -6.2kJ/mol, -5.68kJ/mol, -
5.63kJ/mol respectively. The common residues were found to
be Trp123, Glu356, Glu167, Trp410, His181, Glu409, Trp402,
Gln22, and His122.The result from this study will eventually
give some idea to experimentalist to design better enzyme for
more efficient enzymatic hydrolysis process with higher yields
and also maintain the cost of production as low as possible.
