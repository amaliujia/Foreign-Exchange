Background
In 2009, two kinase inhibitors were approved for the treatment of cancer; 
and another for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma 
[]. Protein-tyrosine 
kinases (PTKs) play an important role in the control of most fundamental 
cellular processes including the cell cycle, cell migration, cell metabolism, 
and cell survival, as well as cell proliferation and differentiation  
[].  
Docking of the molecules into their respective 3D macromolecular targets 
is a widely used method for lead optimization 
[]. Docking programs find 
their most important applications in virtual database screening approaches 
in which hundreds of thousands of molecules are docked into the binding 
pocket to identify plausible binders  []. 
It was reported that docking programs are able to predict experimental poses with deviation average 
from 1.5 to 2.0 Å root mean square deviation (RMSD) 
[]. One of the most 
well-known docking programs is Autodock  [].   
Structure-based drug design methods utilize knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of a 
receptor complexed with a lead molecule in an attempt to optimize the 
bound ligand or a series of congeneric molecules. Using a model with a 
given structure, a medicinal chemist can compute an activity of a molecule 
[].

Development of PTK signaling inhibitors has evolved into an important 
approach toward new therapeutics  []. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a 
target for anti-angiogenesis can be aptly applied as a new mode of cancer 
therapy []. The role of tyrosine kinases in cancer molecular pathogenesis 
is immense and recently tyrosine kinases have come in vogue as potential 
anticancer drug targets, sending a number of anticancer drugs to the 
market. Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors are undergoing human trials and 
several are in the pipeline of drug discovery [].

The main objective of this study is to design and to propose potential 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors from synthesized compounds and databaseselected analogs. 
In this study twelve different target protein tyrosine 
kinases were selected to investigate the potential binding affinities within 
their corresponding binding sites. Those include fibroblast growth factor 
receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor 
receptor, insulin receptor kinase, sarcoma proto-oncogenic kinase, spleen 
tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, vascular 
endothelial growth factor receptor, Abelson tyrosine kinase, hemopoietic 
cell kinase, Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase, and Janus kinase.

The selective PKC inhibitory activities of 5-deazaflavins, 2-deoxy-2-
phenyl-5-deazaflavins, {2-phenylpyrimido[4, 5-b]quinolin-4(10H)-ones}, 
and their effective growth inhibition against cancer cells such as the A431 
cells, and HT1080 cells were reported  []. Synthesis of the hybrid 
compounds, which structurally contain two different biologically or 
pharmacologically active compounds of 5-deazaflavins and steroids in the 
same ring system, were carried out by condensation of 6-(monosubstituted 
amino)uracils or 6-(monosubstituted amino)-2-phenylpyrimidin-4(3H)-
ones with 2-hydroxy-methylene androstanolone or 2-
hydroxymethylenetestosterone.  Eventually, their potential anti-coccidiosis 
activities were reported []. These compounds were synthesized with the 
rationale that steroids can penetrate the cell membrane, and bind the cell 
nucleus.  Steroid receptors may serve to localize and concentrate appended 
drug species, mainly in hormones responsive for the production of 
neoplastic cells. Moreover, 5-deazaflavins (5-deazaisoalloxazines) have 
greatly attracted our attention  [–
]. Antitumor activities of nitro-5-
deazaflavin-pyrrolecarboxamide hybrid molecules  [] and 5-amino-5-
deazaflavin derivatives revealed potential inhibitory activities against 
L1210 or KB cells [].

Methodology
AutoDock protocol
Firstly, all bound waters, ligands and cofactors were removed from the 
proteins. The macromolecule was checked for polar hydrogens, partial 
atomic Kollman charges were assigned, and then atomic solvation 
parameters were allotted.  Torsion bonds of the inhibitors were selected 
and defined. Secondly, the three dimensional grid box was created by 
AutoGrid algorithm to evaluate the binding energies on the macromolecule 
coordinates. The grid maps representing the intact ligand in the actual 
docking target site were calculated with AutoGrid (part of the AutoDock 
package). The three dimensional grid box with 60 Å grid size (x, y, z)  with 
a spacing of 0.300 Å, grid was created.  Eventually cubic grids 
encompassed the binding site where the intact ligand was embedded. 
Finally, AutoDock was used to calculate the binding free energy of a given 
inhibitor conformation in the macromolecular structure while the probable 
structure inaccuracies were ignored in the calculations.

Target macromolecules investigated
Twelve different target protein tyrosine kinases were investigated, and 
those were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do.  For each docking target, crucial 
amino acids of the active site were identified using data in PDBsum, http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbsum/.

Analysis of the docking results
Accelrys DS modeling 1.7 software [DS modeling 1.7; Accelrys Inc., San 
Diego, CA, (2006), www.accelrys.com], and Accelrys DS Visualizer 2.5 
were utilized for molecular modeling, for evaluation of hydrogen bonds in 
ligand‐receptor interaction, and for measuring RMSD which was 
computed and expressed in angstrom (Å) as a locational comparison of two 
molecules of interest. In our particular study RMSD was measured as 
distance between the centroids of the docked inhibitor and the intact ligand.

Molecular docking study
Computer simulated automated docking studies were performed using the 
widely distributed molecular docking software, AutoDock versions  3.05 
and 4.0,  grid-based docking programs [], which was utilized for the study 
of binding mode of the suggested potential inhibitors within different 
tyrosine kinases.  In AutoDock, the overall  docking energy of a given 
ligand molecule is expressed as the sum of intermolecular interaction 
energies including van der Waals attractive and repulsive energies, 
Hbond interaction energy, coulombic electrostatic energy, and the internal 
steric energy of the ligand []:.

Evaluation of docking performance and accurac
As shown in (see ), the RMSD values 
for the representative examples range from 0.07-1 Å to 16 Å. It was found 
that the docked ligands are exactly superimposed with the originally 
embedded intact ligands not only for the best-scored conformations, but 
also for all the docked conformations. The docked compound (PRC1), 1-
terbutyl-3-p-tolyl-1h-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine ligand,  
exhibited the best RMSD of 0.07Å, and a low binding free energy (Gb)  
of -11.56 Kcal/mol. The representative examples of PTKs exhibited fairly 
reasonable docking results well comparable to their originally embedded 
intact ligands.  Hence the obtained docking results were well correlated 
with the biological methods [].

AutoDock binding affinities of the synthesized and designed compounds into PTKs – overview

deazaflavin-10-yl)-n-hexane Xa, was unselectively bound into HGFR/cMet 
(pdb code: 1r0p), which is considered to be an  important cancer drug 
target, as there is a strong link between aberrant c-Met activity and 
oncogenesis []. 

Docking evaluation for ABL inhibitors
The activation of ABL tyrosine kinanse causes chronic myelogenous 
leukemia (CML). Therefore, inhibitors of this PTK is proposed to be 
effective in the treatment of CML. Thus herein compound VIIIb, N3-
phenyl-8-chloro-N10-(3, 4-xylyl)-5-deazaflavin, was tested for docking  
into Abelson tyrosine kinase (ABL, pdb code: 1fpu) to find  potential 
inhibitor candidate. Compound VIIIb exerted binding free energy (Gb) of 
-11.09 kcal/mol, with RMSD of 4.49Å, and one hydrogen bond between its 
2-oxo group and OH of Thr315 was formed.

Docking evaluation for PDFGR inhibitors
The activity of the c-Kit receptor protein-tyrosine kinase is tightly 
regulated in normal cells, whereas the deregulated c-Kit kinase activity is 
implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancers Based on its finding, 
compound VIIl, 2-deoxo-2-tyrosino-5-deazaflavin, was studied for its 
potential binding into platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR,ckit, pdb code: 1t46) 
as shown in . It was found that the docked 
compound VIIl was bound to Tyr670 identically to the intact ligand STI-
571 by two hydrogen bonds via 2-tyrosinyl COOH group, exerting binding 
free energy (ΔGb) of within -11.32 kcal/mol.

code: 1y6a) and showed two hydrogen bonds via its 4-oxo group with HN 
of Asn 921. It exhibited the best RMSD among this series of compounds.

Docking evaluation for ZAP-70 inhibitors
The ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase plays a critical role in T cell activation as well 
as in the immune response, and thus it has become a logical target for 
immunomodulatory therapies. Based on this background, against ZAP-70 
tyrosine kinase (pdb code: 1u59) compound IIb, 4-(3, 5-di-tertbutylphenylcarbamoyl)-2-nitro benzoic acid, was docked within the 
binding site resulting in a strong binding affinity.

Docking evaluation for insulin receptor kinase inhibitors
Tyrosine containing tripeptide, Trp-Glu-Tyr-OH Vd  is structurally similar 
to the structure  of the intact ligand of the insulin receptor kinase (pdb 
code: 1rqq),  thiophosphoric acid o-(adenosyl-phospho)phospho)-sacetamidyl-diester  
(112 E), where there is a ring equivalence between the 
indole and adenine rings of both compounds.  In addition, the structural 
similarity exists between of tripeptides of Vd and triphosphate moiety of 
112E. The docked compound Vd was exactly  superimposed on and 
identically to the intact ligand within 1.32Å RMSD exhibiting five 
hydrogen bonds between the pair of  its COOH groups, indolyl-NH, and

intact ligand PP1-532 of non-receptor tyrosine kinase, (HCK; pdb code: 
1qcf)   and was bound at the ATP-binding site of the kinase, exhibiting one 
hydrogen bond with lys295.  Its lipophilic n-dodecyl moiety comparable to 
the p-tolyl moiety of intact ligand PP1-532 was inserted into an adjacent 
hydrophobic pocket created by VaL281, Lys295, Ile336, and Asp404.

3-g] pteridine-2', 4'(3'H, 8'H)-
diones,  was bound firmly against non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Janus 
kinase (JAK3; pdb code: 1yvj). Janus kinase is a central mediator of 
cytokine signaling. This provides a detailed view of the Jak3 active site, 
where VId exhibits one hydrogen bond between its 17-OH group and O of 
gly831 within RMSD of 2.10Å.

Docking evaluation for tested PTK inhibitors in general

IIa,b, 2, 4, 6-substituted phenoxypyrido[3, 4-d]pyrimidine IVc, tyrosine 
containing tripeptide Vd, 5-deazaandrosta [2, 3-g]pteridine derivatives VIa, 
b, d, 5-deazaflavin and flavin-N-oxide derivatives VIIa, i, l, q, r, N3-
phenyl-8-chloro-N10-(3, 4-xylyl)-5-deazaflavin VIIIb, N10-dodecyl-5-
deazaflavin VIIIc, 5-phenethyl-N10-n-octyl or n-dodecyl-5-deazaflavins 
VIIIf, g,  pyridodipyrimidine derivative IXc, bis-(5-deazaflavin-10-yl)-
nhexane Xa,  and Shumisho database compound 831.

Conclusion
3'and/or8'-disubstituted-5'-deaza-androsta[2, 3-g] pteridine-2', 4'(3'H, 
8'H)-diones VIa, b, and d, vertical bis-(5-deazaflavin-10-yl)-n-hexane Xa, 
exhibited remarkable non-selective PTK binding affinities. They presented
the lowest  ΔGb on docking against different classes of PTKs, i.e. -9.46˜                        
-13. 28, and -0.20 ‐ -13.74 kcal/mol.  Hydrogen bonds were formed from 
ranging from one to four and zero to three with the distance of 1.60 ˜ 4.49 
Å, and 0.72 ˜ 3.08 , respectively. Both of 2-substituted 2-deoxo-5-
deazaflavin and flavins VIIa, i. l, q, r and 5-unsubstituted and 5-
substituted-5-deazaflavins VIIIb, c, f, g also exhibited nonselective fine 
docking results within different PTKs. Furthermore, compounds  IIa, IVc, 
Vd, and 831 demonstrated   to possess selective PTK binding affinities to 
certain classes of tyrosine kinases, namely: HGFR (c-met), ZAP-70, 
insulin receptor kinase, and EGFR, respectively. These findings revealed 
that hybrid compounds of 5-deazaflavins and steroids, that is, VIa, b, and 
VId would be promising candidates as antitumor agents.

Replacement of pyrimidoquinoline ring of 5-deazaflavins or 
benzopteridine ring of flavins with pyridodipyrimidines (IXc) as a new 
NAD-type redox catalyst produced compounds with excellent docking 
binding affinities wherein 2,7,8,10-tetraphenyl substitution enabled planar 
interaction within the target site so as to produce  favorable docking 
affinity. Moreover, tyrosine containing tripeptide, Trp-Glu-Tyr-OH (Vd), 
was found to compose a  platform to produce small lead compounds as 
PTK inhibitors  which exhibit selective insulin receptor kinase binding 
affinity due to  its close structural  resemblance to the intact ligand of the 
insulin receptor kinase (pdb code: 1rqq).

The amino acid coupled with 2-deoxo-5-deazaflavin and flavins (VII l, q, 
r) has been shown to enhance remarkably the binding affinities in PTK. 
The higher affinity of these designed derivatives is presumably attributed 
to the formation of more hydrogen bonds (2‐4 hydrogen bonds) between 
their 2-amino acid moieties and the binding site residues.
