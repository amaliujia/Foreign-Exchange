accuracy for every sequence is not reported by the existing servers. This was overcome by NNvPDB, which not only reported
greater Q3 but also validates every prediction with the homologous PDB entries. NNvPDB is based on the concept of Neural
Network, with a new and different approach of training the network every time with five PDB structures that are similar to query
sequence. The average accuracy for helix is 76%, beta sheet is 71% and overall (helix, sheet and coil) is 66%.

Background
Protein secondary structure prediction plays a vital role and
acts as an intermediate in solving tertiary structures; which
provides an insight in to protein function [1,
2]. Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN) based prediction provides accurate
results when compared to other methods [3]. ANN is a
simplified computational model that is capable of pattern
recognition, feature extraction and image mapping. These are
based on neural biology concepts, where signals are passed
between individual nodes using weighted connection links; and
the activation function used by each node determines the
output [4].

Methodology
Among many existing servers PSIPRED uses two feed forward
neural network on PSI-BLAST output [5]. YASPIN based on
ANN and HMM uses SCOP1.65 to train and test the network
and the datasets are built using PDB [3]. Cfpred, available at (
http://cib.cf.ocha.ac.jp/bitool/MIX/) uses a dataset of 106
protein sequences from PDB to train the network [1]. These
tools have reported higher overall accuracy however, the
challenge remains in validating these predictions automatically
and competently. In this study, ANN coupled with the
homologous sequences were used to predict the secondary
structures of proteins and automatically validate the
predictions upon comparison to homologous PDBs. NNvPDB
predicts three states Helix, Sheet and Coil; and reports percent
accuracy by comparing it with similar PDB structures. This
server would help scientists to extract validated results
efficiently than the existing servers.

Neural Network Algorithm:
The network contains 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer with 4 units
and 1 output layer with 2 units. The input layer has 17 groups
and each group has 21 units (17*21=357), making 357 units
which are binary. A local coding scheme is used to prepare
these binary inputs [1]. The network uses bipolar sigmoid
activation function [6,
7] to the net input as an activation
function. Once the network is initiated, the state of each unit is
defined by the formulae [1].

The main objective of the network is to map the given protein
sequence with its corresponding secondary structure. Once
mapped, the error rate is calculated using delta rule [8], and the
weights of the network are adjusted using back propagation
learning algorithm by gradient descent method to minimize the
error. Each training data is iterated with back propagation
learning until the error is minimized [1]. Once the network is
trained, the query/test set is used without back propagation
algorithm.

Dataset Preparation
Training Set Preparation:
The available tools on machine learning technique use a set of
sequences for training the network. But here, we attempted a
different approach of training the network with 5 sequences
that are homologous to the query sequence, and the effort of
combining neural network concept with homologous training
set provides significant result in predicting the secondary
structure of protein sequence. To implement this concept, we
have written a Perl function to subject the query sequence to
Blastp against the PDB database and five topmost hits are
considered for further study. A sub sequence database is
created using the selected hits. Each sequence in this database
was converted to local coding scheme [1] and the
experimentally determined secondary structures of these
proteins were obtained from PDB secondary structure local
database, and their secondary structure assignments were
converted to binary codes as follows: Helix(1,0), Sheet(0,1) and
coil (0,0).

Network Training:
For each user input sequence, the network is trained using
supervised learning algorithm [1] for 100 iterations using the
training set prepared using above said method. Initially the
network was assigned with a random weight ranging between −
0.5 to 0.5 and the learning rate of the network will get adjusted
according to the percentage identity and query coverage of
blast hits using perl function. Once the network is trained, it is
used to predict the secondary structure of user queried
sequence.

Test Set Preparation:
The protein sequence submitted by user act as test set and it is
prepared [1] and tested against the trained network and the
output is a floating point value, which are converted to binaries
using threshold value. Here, we used a set of 74 sequences
listed in Appendix 1. to validate the network.

Dependency of Q3 on threshold value:
The output of the neural network will be a floating point values
(the network has 2 output units) which will be converted to
binaries (0 or 1) based on some threshold value (t). If the
network output is greater than t, it is set to 1 else it is set to 0
and from the binary values, secondary structures are assigned
([1,0]=helix, [0,1] = sheet, [0,0]=Coils). As the threshold value
has higher influence over the assignment of secondary
structure to the query sequence and in order to get best
secondary structure, we used a set of threshold values ranging
from −0.0001 to 0.9 for converting the floating point output from
the network to binaries. For each threshold value, secondary
structures are assigned and compared with the secondary
structure of topmost blast hit and it׳s Q3 [9] accuracy is
calculated. Threshold value affording secondary structures
with highest Q3 is selected as final structure.

Automatic Validation:
A local DSSP secondary structure database was created for all
the proteins available in PDB. A Perl − MySQL function was
written to select the secondary structures of the top 5 blast hits
from this database. The predicted secondary structure was
validated against the secondary structure of the top 5 Blast hits
and its Q3 accuracy was calculated [9] 
(Figure 1A) validation
result). The overall working principle of this method is
depicted in the flowchart (Figure 2).

Testing NNυPDB with Non- Homologous protein:
The basic of NNυPDB methodology is training the network
dynamically with similar protein sequences. In order to test the
accuracy of NNυPDB for proteins with no homologous, we
took a set of protein sequences listed in Appendix 2. Each
protein in the list is treated as test sequences and for each
sequences, we performed blastp against PDB and selected the
hit which has less than 35 % sequence identity. The selected hit
is used to train the network. Once the network is trained, the
test sequences are applied against the network and the Q3
accuracy was calculated.

Results &amp; Discussion
The query page of NNvPDB (Figure 1A) was designed in a user
friendly manner which accepts single FASTA format protein
sequence. The results page (Figure 1B) provides the predicted
secondary structure of the query sequence, where the states of
the secondary structures are represented as Helix(H), Sheets
(B), Coil (C) and unassigned region(*). The validation table
provides the percentage accuracy of the predicted result by
comparing it with similar existing PDB structures. This table
provides the following information: PDB ID, E-value, query
coverage, percentage identity, subject start, subject end, query
start, query end, length of the query sequence, number of
residues predicted in all 3 states, number of residues correctly
predicted in all 3 states and Q3 accuracy percentage. Since all
the protein sequence available in sequence database does not
have a 100% identical similar PDB structures, so query start and
query end provides information about the segment of the
sequence that are matching with PDB structures which are used
for validation. Validation file (Figure 1C) is provided as part of
result page, which contains the details of blast search, query
sequence, predicted secondary structure and secondary
structures obtained from PDB. (*) is used to represent match
and (.) represents mismatch.

Three State Predictions:
Accuracy of Helix prediction:
The idea behind the NNvPDB was to overcome the
shortcomings and to develop an application better than the
existing ones in the field of secondary structure prediction.
NNvPDB was compared with existing secondary structure
prediction tools Predator (based on local pairwise alignments
and amino acid interactions) [10], SOPMA (multiple sequence
alignment &amp; nearest neighbor method) [11], PHD (Neural
Networks) [12] and SIMPA96 (homology based) 
[13]. A total of
74 sequences were used for validation (Appendix 1). NNυPDB
had the highest Q3 for 28 sequences followed by Predator,
PHD, and SIMPA96 &amp; SOPMA with highest Q3 for 27, 11, 8 &amp; 1
sequence respectively. The relative accuracy at the residue level
was also compared and the results are shown in Table 1(see
supplementary material). Off the 3604 helical residues reported
by the PDB, 2722 were correctly predicted by NNυPDB at 75.5%
accuracy. In the case of other tools, the accuracy percentage was
65.8%, 62.6%, 64.1% &amp; 59.9% for Predator, SOPMA, PHD &amp;
SIMPA96 respectively. These results indicate the better
performance of NNυPDB over other existing applications.

Accuracy of Sheet and Coil prediction:
Similarly, the number of residues experimentally predicted to
be sheets in PDB was 2949; 70.7% off these were correctly
predicted by NNυPDB. The accuracy percentage reported by
NNυPDB was higher than other tools and stood at 50.0%,
54.6%, 61.0% &amp; 49.5% for Predator, SOPMA, PHD &amp; SIMPA96
respectively. This result again shows the better performance of
NNυPDB over other tools. However, the accuracy of coil
prediction by NNυPDB was lowest among all the tools
compared at 48.0% in comparison to 88.0% reported by
Predator. One reason for this was the fact; NNυPDB uses
threshold value as an important parameter to assign the
secondary structure to the query sequence. This threshold value
influences the binary codes representing the secondary
structural states: Helix (1, 0), Sheet (0, 1) and coil (0, 0) as they
are optimized based on the accuracy percentage of query
sequence when compared with PDB.

Q3 percentage accuracy:
Table 1 (see supplementary material) shows the overall
percent accuracy; highest and lowest Q3 obtained for a single
individual sequence by the tools compared. The average
percent accuracy of NNυPDB was 53.5% followed by 52.4%
(Predator) and 48.8% (lowest) by SOPMA. From the pool of 74
sequences, the highest Q3 observed for an individual sequence
was 86.3% (1MBS:A) by Predator, SOPMA (80.0%), and
NNυPDB (79.6%) (2LHB:A). Figure 3 shows the results of the
NNυPDB for the PDB entry 2LHB:A which was compared with
other tools and validated with the experimental PDB results.
The asterisk (*) represent the match and dot (.) represents the
mismatch in predictions between NNυPDB and PDB. 109
accurate predictions were made by NNυPDB of 128 residual
states. Impetus was also on to find the lowest Q3 for the
individual sequence; and it was witnessed Predator (19.6%) to
have the lowest Q3. In the case of NNvPDB, the minimum Q3
recorded was 32.3%, well ahead than the SOMPA at 26.1%.
Although, NNυPDB reported 32.3 % as lowest accuracy for
1IMX:A as shown in Figure 1D(a), it figured out secondary
structure states of 21 out of 36 residues correctly as depicted in
Figure 1D(b). These results typify the promising performance
of NNυPDB in secondary structure prediction when compared
to existing tools.

Comparison of NNυPDB with PHD:
PHD is one of the knowledge based method which generates
profile using multiple sequence alignment and feed the
generated profile as input to network. The network model of
PHD has 3 levels [12]. Since Neural Network act as a base for
the development of NNυPDB and PHD, the secondary
structures predicted by both the applications were compared.
Table 2 brings out the number of residues correctly predicted
by NNυPDB and PHD. The 74 experimentally determined
proteins taken for validation found to comprise 9311 secondary
structural states (Helix, Sheet and Coil). It was observed that
NNυPDB predicted 65.6% (6132 residues) of the states correctly
in comparison to PHD 64.2% (5982 residues) which differs from
NNυPDB by 1.6% which marks the betterment of NNυPDB in
the field of secondary structure prediction.

Sensitivity and Specificity:
Sensitivity and Specificity are the terms to measure the veracity
of the tool; and these were calculated to compare the
performance of NNυPDB and PHD using the formulae [14].
Sensitivity is the measure of proportion of actual positives
which are correctly identified as positives and Specificity
measures the proportion of negatives which are correctly
identified as negatives. Appendix 3 lists out the sensitivity and
specificity calculated for 68 sequences [14]. 
Table 2 (see
supplementary material) summarizes the computed sensitivity
and specificity between NNυPDB and PHD. The average
sensitivity imparted by NNυPDB for helix was 53.6% and for
sheet was 60.3% which was found to be higher than PHD which
had an average sensitivity of 48.3% for helix and 51.5 % for
sheet. But the average coil sensitivity by NNυPDB (42.7%) was
lower than PHD (67.5%) as threshold optimization conquered
the total coil prediction which results in increased specificity of
Coil (77.5%) than by PHD (74.0%).The average specificity for
helix by NNυPDB (61.6%) was lesser than PHD (83.2%) and
specificity of sheet by NNυPDB was higher than PHD which
was 86.7% and 82.3% respectively. When NNυPDB was
compared with PHD with respect to sensitivity and specificity,
NNυPDB tried to map secondary structure states to query
sequence with higher accuracy.

Conclusion
This study was intended to develop a secondary structure
prediction server which not only predicts the residual states,
but also validates the predictions with the structural homologs
housed in the PDB database. NNυPDB promises to predict
helix and sheet states with higher accuracy than Predator,
SOPMA, PHD and SIMPA96 and also validates it
simultaneously; a service offered exclusively by NNυPDB. The
approach of training the network with robust dynamic
homologous dataset ensures higher accuracy than the others.
The overall Q3 reported by NNυPDB was 53.5%. This would
ensure the quality of the predicted structure before advanced
studies could be taken up. NNυPDB would be a notable
advancement in the field of secondary structure prediction with
an attempt to validate the predicted result in an efficient and
accurate manner than the existing servers.
