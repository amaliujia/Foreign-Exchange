Background
The condensation of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate is catalyzed
by citrate synthase (CS, E.C. 4.1.3.7) to form citrate and
coenzyme A. CS is involved in the well-established metabolic
pathway of citric acid biosynthesis []. Although a number of
microorganisms have been reported for citric acid production,
Aspergillus niger is found to be the principal industrial producer
of citric acid []. With many applications, citric acid (CA) is
considered as a specialty chemical and is used in food and
beverages, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, biomedicine and
agriculture []. Among others, the advance applications of citric
acid are also coming to light such as in biopolymers,
fermentation of scaffolds for culturing wide variety of cell lines,
drug delivery agents, bioremediation, wood preservation,
removal of post soldering flux residues and in hydrometallurgy
[]. In 2004 the global production of citric acid was about 1.4
million tons [] and the global market for citric acid is
expanding every year with more than 5% per year.

Keeping in view the importance of citric acid, and more
importantly A. niger as citric acid producer, we mutated and
overexpressed the gene encoding citrate synthase and
determined the increased activity of citrate synthase on citric
acid production. In this study the phylogenetic tree constructed
from citrate synthase fragment was compared to the tree
derived from a traditional marker molecule to study how
citrate synthase gene was transferred among different fungi.
Independent evolution of citrate synthase gene would be
suggested by the dissimilar phylogenies. To represent the
evolution of fungi, the smaller ribosomal subunit (18S
ribosomal DNA [rDNA]) was chosen. Of its nature, this is for
the first time that we compared phylogenetic analysis of citrate
synthase and partial 18S rRNA gene sequences from 30
different fungi including wild and our mutant of A. niger.

We set out to extend our analysis of citrate synthase fragments
to measure polymorphism between wild and our previously
mutated strains of A. niger. RAPD-PCR was employed which is
a simple and convenient technique for DNA fingerprinting and
genetic mapping []. This would open up the possibility of
using the results for many applications while combinatorial
biosynthesis is the most significant one.

Methodology
Chemicals:
The chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.,
Missouri USA, unless otherwise stated.

Fungal strain and Mutagenesis using Ethidium bromide:
Aspergillus niger strain ANJ-120 was obtained from Department
of Microbiology, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad,
Pakistan and subjected to mutagenesis using Ethidium bromide
as we described previously []. 2-deoxy, D-glucose as selective
marker was used to select the mutants and citric acid producing
yellow brown colored colonies were selected for further
studies. Mutants were checked for citrate synthase production
and best producer was further used. Later, the best mutant
strain of A. niger was named as EB-3.

Culture conditions and DNA template preparation:
Aspergillus niger strains ANJ-120 and EB-3 were maintained at 4
oC after growing for 7 days in MYG medium (0.2% malt
extract, 0.2% yeast extract, 2% glucose and 2% agar) at 28 oC
[]. The fungus was cultivated in Vogel's medium for 5 days at
28 oC with shaking at 120 rpm [] with 1% glucose as a carbon
source. For DNA isolation, both wild and mutant strains of A.
niger were grown in Vogel's medium [] supplemented with 2%
glucose. DNA was extracted as described previously [] with
some modifications.

PCR amplification of 18S rDNA and citrate synthase gene fragments:
The 18S rDNA was amplified from wild and mutant strains of
A. niger with primers 5'-TCC GTA GGT GAA CCT GCG (sense
primer) and 5'-CAT ATG CTT AAG TTG AGC GGG (antisense
primer). To isolate a partial DNA encoding citrate synthase
from both strains using PCR, oligonucleotides were designed
and the sequences of the primers were 5'-TCT TTC TCT CCT
CTC TTT CTT TCC TTC CAA CCA C (sense primer) and 5'-
CAG AAG ACG ATT GAC TTG GAA TTT CTC AAG TGC
TGT T (antisense primer).

Taq DNA polymerase with 10X PCR buffer, MgCl2 and dNTPs
were obtained from Fermentas. The amplification of 18S rDNA
was carried out under the following conditions: 30 cycles of 1
min at 94 °C, 1 min at 42 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final
extension of 10 min at 72 °C. While the amplification of citrate
synthase was carried out under the conditions of 30 cycles of 1
min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, with a final
extension of 15 min at 72 °C.

Cloning and sequencing of the amplified PCR fragments:
The amplicons of expected sizes for 18S rDNA and citrate
synthase were gel purified with a Qiagen QIAquick PCR
cleanup kit using protocols provided by the manufacturer. The
fragments were cloned and sequenced with the same sets of
primers from the Centre for Applied Molecular Biology
(CAMB), Lahore, Pakistan.

Phylogenetic Analysis:
The forward and reverse sequences of both 18S rRNA and
citrate synthase genes sequenced in this study were assembled
and analyzed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool) [] available on the NCBI website
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Along with our wild and
mutant sequences for 18S rRNA and citrate synthase genes of
A. niger twenty eight most similar sequences of different fungi
were also retrieved from GenBank for the comparison study.
All the sequences were aligned using ClustalX and imported
into the Bioedit program [] for manual alignment. Neighborjoining
phylogenetic trees were constructed for 18S RNA and
citrate synthase genes using the program MEGA5 [] with 100
bootstrap replicates.

RAPD-PCR analysis:
DNA fingerprinting was performed with a set of fifteen 10-base
oligonucleotide RAPD primers (OPA-1, OPA-4, OPA-5, OPA-7,
OPA-9, OPC-4, OPC-5, OPC-6, OPC-8, OPC-10, OPC-11, OPC-
14, OPE-2, OPE-3, OPE-6) obtained from Operon Tchnologies,
Inc., Aalamada, CA, USA. A total of 25 µL reaction volume was
made for PCR amplification, containing 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM
each of dNTPs, 30 ng of primer, 0.001% gelatin, 25 ng of DNA
and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. Amplifications were
carried out in Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient, programmed
for a first denaturation step of 5 min at 94 °C followed by 40
cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 36 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min and
one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min, and then held at 20 °C until the
PCR tubes were removed []. The products were
electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel using 0.5X TBE buffer and
visualized under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide
and photographed on EagleEye Gel Documentation System.
RAPD amplification was repeated two times and reproducible,
explicitly score-able fragments were considered only. For the
analysis of genetic diversity, all the polymorphic loci were
scored as present/absent. To estimate the similarity between
both genomes on the basis of number of shared amplification
products, the bi-variate 1-0 data was used as done by [].

Results
After treating for 120 min with ethidium bromide the EB-3
strain of A. niger was selected as best mutant as it showed best
growth in the presence of selective marker. The colonies that
were turned to yellow brown color were selected. For further
selection on the basis of maximum citric acid production from
these petri plates five colonies were picked and grown on
slants.

Analysis of the 18S rDNA tree:
The gene encoding 18S rDNA subunit was amplified from wild
and mutant strains of A. niger and analyzed using BLAST. The
partial nucleotide sequences corresponding to the gene
encoding 18S rRNA were deposited in the GenBank and
allotted accession numbers JN587346 and KF997092 for ANJ-
120 (wild) and EB-3 (mutant) strains of A. niger respectively. In
addition to our wild and mutant strains of A. niger which
belongs to Eurotiomycetes class, 28 closely related sequences of
different fungi from three classes i.e. 14 sequences from
Eurotiomycetes, 10 sequences from Sordariomycetes and 4
sequences from the class Dothideomycetes were added to the
analysis. All these sequences were used to construct a multiple
alignment and a phylogenetic tree, which is shown in 
(). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 18S rRNA sequence was used as
an outgroup in the analysis. The evolutionary history was
inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method []. The tree is
fully in accordance with the fungal classification system and all
the fungi fall in their respective classes. By using only partial
18S rDNA it was revealed by the bootstrap analysis of the tree
(100 replicates) that all of the phylogenetic relationships were
not fully resolved. However the clearly separable clades in the
tree can be used to compare the fungi found in these branches
to the fungi in the citrate synthase tree to investigate the
similarity of the two trees.

Analysis of the citrate synthase (CS) tree:
The partial nucleotide sequences of citrate synthase gene from
wild and mutant strains of A. niger were also deposited to
GenBank which appeared under accession numbers KC847093
and JF415912 respectively. A Neighbor-Joining tree was
constructed from the nucleotide sequences encoding citrate
synthase gene of the same 30 fungi of Eurotiomycetes,
Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes classes which were
used to construct 18S rDNA tree. The distantly related citrate
synthase gene from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was used as an
outgroup (). The percentage of replicate trees in which
the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (100
replicates) is shown next to the branches []. The tree is drawn
to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the
evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The
evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum
Composite Likelihood method [] taking transitions and
transversions into account and are in the units of the number of
base substitutions per site. The differences in the composition
bias among sequences were considered in evolutionary
comparisons []. All positions containing gaps and missing
data were eliminated.

Incongruities between the two phylogenetic trees:
Comparison of the distribution of selected fungi in two
phylogenetic trees shows that there seems to be no correlation
between CS and 18S rDNA sequences. For instance, in 18S
rDNA tree Eurotiomycetes contains all the 16 fungi of this class
in one major clade but in CS tree they have been divided into
three separate subclades. Talaromyces stipitatus does not fall in
any clade of its class and making a separate one. Like 18S
rDNA all the four species of A. niger are closely related in CS
tree as well and the bootstrap value of 79% is justifying the
closeness of wild and mutant strains of A. niger Similarly,
Pyrenophora teres, Alternaria longipes, Leptosphaeria maculans and
Parastagonospora nodorum were selected from the class
Dothideomycetes which appear in one clade in 18S rDNA but
in CS tree Leptosphaeria maculans gets separated from the other
three fungi. The most interesting case is with the class
Sordariomycetes. The class contains 10 fungi in total which
appear in one major clade in 18S rDNA tree but in CS tree they
are behaving differently and 8 of them are falling in one clade
at the top of the tree while Chaetomium globosum and
Trichoderma reesei are making a separate clade at the base of the
tree and are separated by a great phylogenetic distance. In
addition to above described examples numerous other
discrepancies can also be found in two phylogenetic trees.
Taken together, the results of phylogenetic studies strongly
imply that the evolution of citrate synthase is independent of
the evolution of fungal species. Finally, it should be noted that
the 18S rDNA and CS tree comparisons were made by using
trees which contain sequences appearing in both trees.

Citric acid production by A. niger transformant overproducing citrate synthase:
When we compared the activity of citrate synthase gene from
the mutant strain of A. niger with the wild one, it was observed
that citric acid production by the mutant EB-3 was significantly
enhanced i.e. from 19.4 to 64.20 mg/mL which was further
enhanced to 112 mg/mL [] by optimizing fermentation
parameters and by adding suitable surfactant, nitrogen source,
metabolic inhibitor and metal ion complexing reagent (data not
shown). Sequence comparison of citrate synthase from both
strains revealed that in addition to substitutions, deletion
mutations in the mutant EB-3 strain of A. niger were observed
that resulted in hyper-expression of citrate synthase.

DNA fingerprinting:
In this study, we delivered and compared the genomes of two
strains of A. niger i.e. ANJ-120 and EB-3. Both strains appeared
having some different phenotypes: the EB-3 predecessor to
efficient citric acid producing strain having undergone some
level of mutagenesis, and the other ANJ-120, a wild-type parent
strain. This finding makes the comparison interesting both in
terms of genomic research and industrial applications of citric
acid. In total 31 primers were used to amplify the genomic
DNA in both the strains that gave sufficient polymorphism
between the two A. niger isolates. A total of 98 score-able
amplified DNA fragments ranging in size from 250 bp to 3.5 kb
base pairs were observed using 15 primers of the three series
 
(see supplementary material), with an average of ~6
fragments per primer. It was observed that 28 fragments were
polymorphic (PAF) and 70 bands were monomorphic (CAF)
between isolates of A. niger. The fifteen primers showed
polymorphic percentage 28.57%, as well as among amplified 70
monomorphic bands with percentage 71.43%. Results of this
effort showed that there is a significant change between the
genetic makeup of A. niger ANJ-120 and A. niger EB-3.

Discussion
The improvement of citric acid producing strains by
mutagenesis and selection is not a new field. Use of different
mutagens to induce mutations in the parental strains has been
the most employed technique []. Ultra violet radiations, γ-
radiations and chemical mutagens are mostly used to induce
mutations. For commercial production mutants of A. niger are
used [] and UV treatment combined with some chemical
mutagens is mostly used to get hyper-producer strains of A.
niger. Enhanced production of citric acid by mutagenesis of A.
niger has been reported by some workers. For example,
mutations introduced by ultraviolet-irradiation, ethyl methane
sulfonate and acridine orange enhanced the citric acid
production to 3.2 fold in A. niger []. Gamma-rays irradiation
on A. niger mutants also improved the production of citric acid
significantly [].

Recent studies of genetic engineering tools [] have revealed
that the filamentous fungi have become an important source of
certain compounds. These are gifted with high yields and
secretion capacity in addition to favorable media requirements
[]. Aspergillus niger is an important producer of citric acid on
industrial scale because its fermentation processes have been
well studied and tested, and the fungus has earned a status of
‘generally regarded as safe’ which has made it an attractive
host for biotechnological production []. For citric acid
production, citrate synthase is a key enzyme and its activity is
observed throughout the acidogenic growth of A. niger [].
Although the sequences of citrate synthase from different fungi
are known but prior to its genome publication [], the citA
gene was studied from only two strains of A. niger although
their focus was on the production of citric acid and not on the
promoter of citA [].

The phylogenetic analysis showed that A. niger ANJ-120 and A.
niger EB-3 clustered together in both trees. The study of gene
and genome evolution has been revolutionized by the
introduction of molecular techniques and allowed new
approaches to phylogenetic inference. In particular, when
biochemical features have proven to be insufficient then
molecular sequences are useful for comparisons among
distantly related species []. For phylogenetic studies NJ
method has been reported to be a better alternative to
maximum parsimony method []. NJ and maximum
likelihood methods have been shown to be generally more
efficient and nearly equally efficient than the maximum
parsimony method []. A high variability was also observed
between genome sequences of A. niger ATCC 1015 and A. niger
CBS 513.88 through phylogenetic analysis [].

In this study we collected 30 sequences of different fungi along
with our wild and mutant strains of A. niger for traditional 18S
rDNA and citrate synthase gene because to gain insight into the
evolutionary relationships of different fungi 18S rDNA has
been extensively used []. The data presented here shows that
there is no evident correlation between the phylogenetic trees
constructed by using these different molecules. The results also
show that the fungi which are clustered together in 18S rDNA
phylogenetic tree fall in separate clades when tried for citrate
synthase phylogenetic tree and found distantly related. These
results strongly suggest that citrate synthase gene transferred
independently among different fungi having no evolutionary
relationships. It is significant that there are no inconsistencies in
the CS tree and the fungi of the same class are not represented
in the same clade of the tree.

To study genetic variation between species RAPD-PCR is a
powerful tool but reproducibility is the major concern in the
amplification of RAPD markers []. To differentiate different
strains of A. niger and other strains random primers have been
successfully employed worldwide []. In those developing
countries where advanced facilities are not available, RAPDPCR
technique can be utilized effectively to differentiate
between wild and mutant cells, intra-specific and inter-specific
strains of different organisms []. We emphasized RAPD-PCR
to verify whether the wild strain of A. niger was genetically
different from the mutant one or not. To overcome the
reproducibility problem, in the present study only
major/bright DNA fragments were scored. Because of random
priming nature of PCR reaction the minor fragments were not
considered [].

In conclusion, we successfully subjected Aspergillus niger ANJ-
120 to mutagenesis by treating with ethidium bromide for
hyperproduction of citric acid. Citrate synthase gene of wild
and mutant was amplified, sequenced and compared. RAPDPCR
was performed which confirmed a momentous change in
the genetic makeup of mutant strain. Only 71.43% similarity
was found between both the genomes which suggested that
there is a potential difference between these two strains of A.
niger. Mutant strain of A. niger could easily be differentiated
from the wild strain by its unique amplification products which
are the results of acquired genetic variation by mutation. No
correlation was observed between 18S rDNA used for
traditional evolutionary study of fungi and citrate synthase
phylogenetic trees. Enhanced production of citric acid from the
mutant strain might provide a very significant boost to muddle
through the economic expediency and commercial scale
feasibility of this useful product.
