Background
In now a days, computers are as likely to be used by biologists 
as by any other highly trained professionals, more specifically 
in field of bioinformatics; which is focused on making 
predictions about biological systems and to analyze biological 
data related to different diseases like cancer []. As in 
computational biology tools are used to predict if two proteins 
interact or not, if prediction is accurate then computational 
biology could further be used to analyze biological data 
obtained from a wet lab experiment. This field can be further 
broken down into molecular modeling and bioinformatics. 
Several bioinformatics methods are applied for the different 
mutational disease analysis []. Many of them are based on 
protein sequence, but several are structure-based, as the latter 
are more reliable and provide more information. In this work, 
we have built a homology model of mutated BRMS1 gene 
applying the most updated available methods of Homology 
modelling through MODELLER, [] and have investigated the 
effects of mutations of BRMS1 using different software, 
including SNAP it is a neural-network based method which 
evaluates the single amino acid substitution effects on protein 
functions []. I-Mutant2.0 is a web server used for the 
prediction of protein stability changes upon single-site 
mutations. It works on Support Vector Machine based method 
[]. PolyPhen2.0.9 it uses structural and comparative 
evolutionary considerations and predicts the impacts of amino 
acid substitutions on the stability and function of human 
proteins []. IUPred predicts the disorder tendency of particular 
amino acid [], PrDOS gives the information about the disorder 
region of particular protein [] and HNB servers is a protein 
function annotation tool having consortium of three different 
tools (SMART, miniPEDANT and STRING) that collectively 
involves in functional domain prediction along with the 
alignment to different protein databases [].

Worldwide, breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer 
affecting women, and its prevalence and death rate are 
expected to increase by 50% between 2002 and 2020 []. This 
expected increase of cancer rate is extremely high in developing 
countries and in less than 20 years, these rates are likely to 
reach 55% increase in occurrence and 58% in death rate 
[]. In 
2008, total 48,034 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, 
out of which 47,693 (&gt;99%) were in females and 341 (less than 
1%) in males []. Among Asian countries such as in Pakistan 
the incidence rate of breast cancer is increasing alarmingly. In 
Pakistani females breast cancer is considered as most common
malignancy accounting for 34.6% all female cancer, its rate is 2.5 
times higher than neighboring countries like Iran and India 
[].

In other developing countries, breast cancer shows a major 
affliction among younger women. In women having age less 
than 45 years, &gt;20% cases of BC occurrence and &gt;20% of BC 
mortality are observed but on the other hand in developed 
countries these statistics are less than 10% and 20%, 
respectively []. 
However, the definition of “young woman” 
may differ for breast cancer and in most articles woman having 
age less than 35, 40 or 45 years is considered as “young” 
[].


Different risk factors are associated with breast cancer such as 
sex, age, family history, early menarche and late menopause 
[]. Many reproductive hormones are also considered as 
influential factor to increase breast cancer risks by affecting cell 
proliferation, which result in increase the probability of DNA 
damage and the elevation of cancer growth []. Out of many 
known risk factors breast cancer is specifically associated with 
the metastasis. Metastasis is the process which involves in the 
propagation of cancerous cells and establishment of secondary 
tumors away from the primary tumor []. The propagation of 
cancerous cells away from primary tumor is through the 
circulatory system. In metastasis process these tumor forming 
cells get attached to other neighboring cells or proteins 
[].
Normally metastasis is suppressed by Breast cancer Metastasis 
Suppressor 1 (BRMS1) gene. The breast cancer metastasis 
suppressor 1 (BRMS1) gene is mapped on human chromosome 
11q13 [] and suppresses the metastatic probability of tumor 
forming cells in vitro without affecting the growth of these cells 
[]. Different studies have shown that BRMS1 gene not only 
suppresses metastasis in xenograft models of breast cancer 
[]
but also in melanoma [,
], ovarian cancer [], bladder 
cancer [] and lung cancer 
[].

It is also suggested that BRMS1 is a nuclear protein containing a 
damaged leucine zipper motif and coiled-coiled domains, may 
involving as a component of transcriptional complex [].
Inhibition of metastasis may also take place through the 
interaction of BRMS1 to histone deacetylase [,
]. Recent 
studies have shown that the mutation in BRMS1 gene leads to 
its malfunctioning and results in breast cancer. Different genetic 
mutations such as (F71L, R163Q, D154H and E135K) [] are 
responsible for the change in expression of BRMS1 gene which 
is associated with the breast cancer. This approach allowed a 
preliminary characterization of BRMS1 gene mutations, with 
prediction of their potential molecular pathogenic effect.

Methodology
F71L, R163Q, D154H and E135K mutations in family BRMS1 
Gene were examined by using various bioinformatics 
approaches. The effect of single amino acid substitution on 
protein structure, function and stability were analyzed.

Mutational Screening:
Twenty two mutations reported within BRMS1 gene were 
retrieved from COSMIC database it is a catalogue of somatic 
mutation in cancer database that contains the information about 
the mutations in human genome that are associated with the
cancer []. These mutations were analyzed through different 
Bioinformatics tools. Out of twenty two only four mutations 
were selected as they were the part of functional domains 
 (see supplementary material). For the domain analysis 
of BRMS1 gene, protein function annotation feature of the HNB 
server was used []. The server shows that whether the 
mutating amino acids are the part of the functionally important 
domain or not. Furthermore, 3D modeling of the domain was 
done to study the single amino acid change in structure as 
described in next sections.

Comparative modeling:
The target BRMS1 protein structure (PDB ID Q9HCU9) and 
sequence was retrieved from Uniprot KB []. Already reported 
mutations were induced manually in normal BRMS1 protein 
sequence. Different structure prediction programs such as the 
BuildModel option of FoldX version 3.0 beta [], Pcons 
[], 
Genesilico [], I- Tasser 
[] and RaptorX 
[], MODELLER 
[]
were used to predict the mutated structures of BRMS1. The 
program MODELLER was mainly used for this purpose 
because it yielded fine results and it generated a model having 
all non-hydrogen atoms. MODELLER satisfied all spatial 
restraints by the implementation of comparative protein 
structure modeling []. Qmean 
[], PROCHECK 
[] and 
ProsA web (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php ) 
server [] were used for structural assessment. In order to 
analyze the similarity, Chimera was used to superimpose all 
mutated and normal BRMS1 protein structures and the Root 
Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values were also computed 
[].

Mutation analysis:
NetSurfP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetSurfP/) was 
used to find out the surface accessible area of all four selected 
mutations []. The effect of single amino acid substitution on 
protein functionality and stability was tested using different 
methods including SNAP [], which predicts the effects of 
single amino acid substitution on protein functionality and I
Mutant2.0 [], which finds the influence of single amino acid 
changes on protein stability. SNAP server gives output in the 
form of numerical values that show the reliability of the 
prediction. These output values range from -100 to 100, 
showing the neutral to abnormal functioning, respectively. I
Mutant2.0 server predicts the AAG (Gibbs free energy) values 
before and after mutation. This AAG value is estimated 
through the equation: AGf wt - AGf mut. Where, wt stands for 
wild type and mut is mutated protein. Poly-Phen2.0.9 
(Polymorphism and Phenotype) (http:// genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/) server was used to find out whether 
the mutations were structurally damaging or not []. IUPred 
[] and PrDOS 
[] servers were also used to study the effects 
of mutations and structural disorder on BRMS1 protein.

Results &amp; Disscussion
BRMS1 protein structure prediction through comparative modeling:
To investigate the changes in structure of mutated BRMS1 
protein, models were generated through homology modeling 
using MODELLER as shown in (). For each mutation, 
MODELLER predicts top scoring models with almost 100% 
confidence score. However, for the identification of the errors in 
mutated models number of algorithm's comparison can be 
helpful e.g. I-Tasser, Gensilico.

The predicted models were evaluated using different 
algorithms and methods. Qmean score of generated models of 
all selected mutations was in the range of 0-1, indicating 
reliability of the models. Mutated BRMS1 model's evaluation by 
Procheck for stereo chemical quality showed that structures 
predicted by MODELLER were best quality models and had 
83.3% of residues in favored regions, 14.5% of residues in 
allowed regions, and 0.9% residues in disallowed regions for 
F71L. For R163Q mutation, 84.2% of residues were in favored 
regions, 11.3% of residues in allowed regions, and 2.3% 
residues in disallowed regions. For D154H mutated model, 
85.5% of residues were in favored regions, 10.9% of residues in 
allowed regions, and 1.4% residues in disallowed regions. 
While for E135K mutation, 85.5% of residues were in favored 
regions, 10.9% of residues in allowed regions, and 1.4% 
residues in disallowed regions. This ensured the quality of the 
predicted model as &gt;90% residues in favorable regions, provide 
a good quality model. All the models were also validated using 
Swiss model [] and ProsA-web 
[], which gave a negative Z
score indicating a good quality of mutated models. RMSD 
values were calculated using Chimera, where high RMSD value 
shows the maximum deviation of mutated and normal BRMS1 
structure  (see supplementary material).

Mutation analysis:
Surface accessibility was checked by using NetSurfP 
[].
NetSurfP server provided information about the exposed and 
buried amino acids of the protein. Buried amino acid residues 
are considered to be more important because they are involved 
in the formation of core interactions that are necessary for 
protein stability []. Therefore, it was determined whether the 
mutated residues were buried or exposed. Residues number 71 
was buried while other residues number 163,154 and 135 were 
found to be exposed shown in (). Any mutation in 
these residues may result in conformational changes of the 
protein and may alter stability of the protein.

Impact of mutations on function and stability:
After investigating the SNAP output, it was analyzed that 
whether mutations F71L, R163Q, D154H and E135K can affect 
the function of the protein. The predictions for F71L and D154H 
mutation were non-neutral showing the change in the function 
with the reliability value of 2 and expected accuracy of 
70%.While, mutations R163Q and E135K were found to be 
neutral. I- Mutant2.0 server was used for the prediction of 
change on protein stability. The output provided the DDG 
score of -1.91 for F71L, -0.70 for E135K, 0.20 for D154H and 0.20 
for R163Q. A score below 0 shows decrease in stability and a 
score above 0 shows an increase in stability. Thus, all these 
mutations may have effect on the stability of the structure 
indicated by their negative score. The scale of damaging effect 
provided by PolyPhen2.0.9 shows a score starting from 0.00 to 
1.00 where a score close to 1 is considered as a potential 
damage. The output of PolyPhen-2.9.0 server provided scores 
for all selected mutations in the range of 0.994-1.00. Mutation 
F71L and E135K had score of 1 showing damaging effect, while 
0.49 for R163Q has less damaging effect as compared to D154H 
which also found to have a damaging effect with score of 0.806 
 (see supplementary material).

Domain analysis:
Functional domains of BRMS1 gene were predicted through 
HNB server (http://dag.embl-heidelberg.de/hnb_cgi/ how_ 
overview_page.pl?taskId=_notask ). It was found that there are 
two coiled-coil domains in BRMS1 protein. One is from 51 to 
81amino acids and other is from 147 to 180 amino acid residues. 

Protein disorder analysis:
Mutations are associated with the disorder of a protein which 
ultimately causes the loss of a regular secondary structure. 
Disordered regions were predicted using IUPred server, which 
predicted that mutation F71L have disorder tendency of 0.4017, 
R163Q have 0.3948, D154H have 0.2436 and E135K have 0.1611, 
respectively. Disordered tendency for mutating residues was 
calculated at the scale of 0-1.00. The mutating residues showed 
low disorder tendency. Additionally, PrDOS server showed 
region 1-52, 185-201 and 235-246 as disordered regions. 
Mutating residues were not found in the disordered region of 
the protein.

Conclusion
Our results have shown that missense mutations F71L, R163Q,
D154H and E135Khave strong structural, conformational and 
functional effects on mutated protein. Moreover it also affects 
the stability of protein therefore these mutations are 
pathogenic.
