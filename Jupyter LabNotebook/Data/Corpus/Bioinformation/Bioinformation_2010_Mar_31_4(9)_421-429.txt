Background
Multi drug resistance in P. falciparum to the commonly used
antimalarial agents is becoming more and more widespread and poses
a serious threat to conventional and current therapeutic treatments. An
alternative class of antimalarial compound, sesquiterpenoid
artemisinin from Artemisia annua L. is effective against both
chloroquine­resistant and sensitive strains of Plasmodium species as
well as the species causing cerebral malaria. Its relative low yield
(0.01­1.1 % dry weight) [,
] however, has caused a serious concern
in commercializing the drug []. The physiological and cell culture
studies were carried out to improve the yield of artemisinin, but were
mostly unsatisfactory []. The chemical synthesis of artemisinin is
also possible, but it is complicated and economically unviable due to
the poor yield []. Recent reports have highlighted the use of
biotechnological approaches such as metabolic engineering and
genetic modification of microbe and plants as a feasible alternative
for the semi­synthesis of artemisinin and its precursors [,
]. S.
cerevisiae had been enginnered to produce artemisinic acid, precursor
of artemisinin, at a significantly higher level than in A. annua []. The
complete synthesis of artemisinin outside the source plant is however,
not achieved yet and has to rely either on biotransformation using
plant extract [,] or semisynthesis 
[] to obtain end product. Studies
have been conducted in different laboratories to elucidate the
biochemical pathway of artemisinin and its regulation with an aim to
improve artemisinin content of A. annua L. Based on the biosynthetic
pathway for artemisinin starting from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)
followed by synthesis of germacrane skeleton, dihydrocostunolide,
cardinanolide, arteannuin B and artemisinin [], but these studies did
not indicate artemisinic acid as precursor of artemisinin. In another
study, two compounds (secocadinane and dihydroxycadinanolide)were isolated and postulated an alternative route for artemisinin
biosynthesis []. According to this postulate, arteannuin B gets
converted into a dihydroxycadinanolide, which then undergoes Grobs
fragmentation to yield an enolic form of a secocadinane. This further
undergoes enzymatic oxygenation yielding artemisitene, which finally
reduces to artemisinin. The in vitro and in vivo transformation of
artemisinic acid to arteannuin B and artemisinin with an over all yield
of 4.0  % [], suggesting that artemisinic acid is a common precursor
for both arteannuin B and artemisinin. This was confirmed by several
studies employing crude and semi purified cell free extracts of leaf
homogenates of A. annua, where arteannuin B was found an
intermediate in the bioconversion of artemisinic acid to artemisinin
[]. The transformation of dihydroartemisinic acid into artemisinin by
cell free extracts from A. annua L. plants []. These studies thus,
indicate that artemisinic acid is converted into artemisinin either via
arteannuin B or dihydroartemisinic acid. Recently, amorpha­4, 11­
diene synthase (ADS), has been identified as first enzyme of
artemisinin biosynthesis. It has also been reported to be the key
regulatory enzyme which catalyzes the cyclization of farnesyl
pyrophosphate (FPP) into the sesquiterpenoid skeleton, amorpha­
4,11­diene [,
]. Thus, increasing the activity of amorpha­4,11­
diene synthase (ADS) enzyme through overexpression of its gene in
A. annua L. may be a promising approach to enhance artemisinin
biosynthesis. Consequently, several groups have reported the
cloning, sequencing and expression of Amorpha­4,11­diene synthase
genes from different strains of A. annua L. [–]. In this paper, we
report cloning and characterization of a putative Amorpha­4, 11­ diene
synthase gene (ADS3963) from high yielding A. annua L. strain
(0.7­0.9  % artemisinin dry weight basis).

Methodology
The seeds of Artemisia annua L., a high artemisinin yielding strain
(0.7­0.9 % artemisinin dry weight basis) was provided by the Ipca
Laboratories Limited, Ratlam, MP, India. Plants were grown in the
experimental field of Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.

Isolation of genomic DNA
Fresh leaves were collected from A. annua L. plants at pre­flowering
stage. The extraction of DNA was done by modified CTAB method[].

Generation of A. annua L. primers
The PCR primers were designed using published Amorpha­4, 11­
diene synthase sequence retrieved from NCBI GenBank (Acc. no.
AF327527) from A. annua L. plant. The primers were derived from
total ORF region of Amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase gene and were
synthesized by Sigma­Aldhrich Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. with the
following sequences: Forward primer,
ATGTCACTTACAGAAGAAAAACCTATTC and Reverse primer,
TCATATACTCATAGGATAAACG.

Amplification of Amorpha­4, 11­ diene synthase (ADS3963)
The PCR reaction mixtures containing 100 μl PCR mastermix [(0.2
mmol of each deoxynucleotide, buffer and 1.5 mmol of MgCl2), 1 μl
(of 1 μg/μl) of each forward and reverse primer and 0.5 μl (5U) of
Taq DNA polymerase]   was divided into ten 9 μl aliquots. One
microlitre of Artemisia annua L. genomic DNA was added as either
neat, 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 dilution to make the final reaction mixture 10
μl. The cycling parameters were 95 °C for 3 min: 40 cycles of
denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C an
extension for 1 min at 72 °C, with final extension 72 °C for 5 min.

Cloning of amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase
The resulting PCR product was purified and ligated into the pDrive
cloning vector (Qiagen Pvt. Ltd.) following the manufacturer's
instruction. The ligation mixture was then used to transform DH5α E.
coli (100 μl) competent cells. The cells were mixed with 900 μl of
Luria broth (LB) medium, incubated at 37°C for an hour and E. coli
cell culture (100 μl) was plated onto X­gal/Amp/IPTG/LB plate.
Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the recombinant colonies
were picked and used for plasmid extraction. Plasmid DNA was
purified using Gene JETTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Fermentas Life
Science) following the manufacture's instructions. The clones were
confirmed through PCR.

Sequencing of Amprpha­4, 11­diene synthase (ADS3963)
 The sequencing of ADS3963 gene cloned in pDrive was
carried out through automated sequencer at Bangalore Genei,Bangalore.

Nucleotide and Protein Sequence Accession Number 
The genomic sequence of Amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase gene having
3963 bp and its annotation has been submitted to GenBank and was
assigned accession numbers FJ432667 for nucleotide and protein
ACL15394.

Domain/Motif Search
PROSITE scan at the EXPaSy (http://www.expasy.ch/tools/scanprosite) was used to identify
ROSITE motif in amorpha 4­11­diene synthase protein.

Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences of ADS3963 (FJ432667) from A. annua L.
and other sesquiterpene synthase genes (EU798693, Santalum album

between nucleotide sequences was developed by MEGA 4.0
program to create Neighbour­Joining tree []. Bootstrap
probability was introduced to assure the statistical significance of
groups in the phylogenetic tree [].

Homology modeling of ADS3963
Template searching
In an attempt to search the suitable template for modeling the
ADS3963 protein, (PS)2 MODELLER server
[http://ps2.life.nctu.edu.tw/], an online tool for searching template
based on sequence and structure­ wise similarity was used []. On
the basis of homology percentage (39%), single template of the 5­epi­ aristolochene synthase [PDB ID: 5eau] was selected [] for 3D
modeling of ADS3963 protein.

Sequence alignment
Amino acid sequence alignment of target and template protein was
done using the Swiss­PdbViewer package
(http://www.expasy.ch/spdbv/) with default parameters. The
aligned sequences were checked and adjusted manually to minimize
the number of gaps and insertions. The homology based modeling
was used to predict the 3D structure of ADS3963. The (PS)2
MODELLER was used for alignment as well as modeling. The
scripts were also employed to perform an alignment between the
target and template sequence. A predicted 3D model was then
obtained from the script model default based on the generated
alignment.

Refinement and validation of predicted structure
The predicted model constructed was solvated and subjected to
constraints of energy minimization with a harmonic constraint of 100
kJ/mol/Å2 applied for all protein atoms, using the steepest
descent and conjugate gradient technique to eliminate bad contacts
between protein atoms and structural water molecules.
Computations were carried out in vacuo with the GROMOS96 43B1.
The stereo chemical quality of the predicted structure was
assessed by VADAR (http://www.redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/vadar) 
[] and
PROCHECK (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/). Ramachandran analysis
showed that more than 90 % amino acids of ADS3963 gene were in
most favored region, which supports the reliability of the predicted
model.

Docking of Amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase (ADS3963) with Substrate Farnesyl Pyrophosphate (FPP)
After obtaining the final model, the centre co­ordinates of probable
binding sites of enzyme were extracted using PASS (Putative Active
Sites with Spheres) version pass10_2.0.36.
(http://www.ccl.net/cca/software/UNIX/pass). FPP (PDB ID: 1UBY)
was used as a substrate for docking studies. The ligand coordinates
(FPP) were downloaded from Protein Data bank
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). The FPP was docked
with ADS3963 using th e L ama r c k i an Genetic algorithm (LGA)
provided by the AutoDock program, version 4
(http://autodock.scripps.edu/). The docking of FPP was performed
with respect to all the 17 binding sites of the enzyme. The residues
lining the cavities within 10Å region around the ligand molecule were
extracted using a GETNEAREST [] and LIGPLOT [] was used
to plot protein­ligand interactions.

Results and Discussion
Amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase belongs to the class of enzymes
referred as sesquiterpene synthases (sesquiterpene cyclases).
These are very similar in physical and chemical properties. Based on
their similar reaction mechanism, conserved structural and
sequence characteristics including amino acid sequence homology,conserved sequence motif, introns number and exon size, several
groups have suggested that plant sesquiterpene synthases have a
common evolutionary origin. Because of lack of the knowledge of
structure­function correlation, it was impossible to predict the
function of terpene synthases solely on the degree of sequence
identity until now []. The cloned ADS3963 gene sequence
(FJ432667) from a high yielding strain of A. annua by us, have
shown 98 % identity with nucleotide and amino acid sequences
derived from earlier published A. annua ADS genes. The genomic
organization of ADS3963 gene comprises of 7 exons (17­103; 218­448; 2126­2508; 2685­2903; 3032­3170; 3268­3516 and 3629-3922)
and 8 introns (1­16; 104­217; 449­2125; 2509­2684; 2904­3031;
3171­3267; 3515­3628 and 3923­3963), respectively (). The
deduced mass and the pI of the encoded protein are 62.2 kDa and 5.25,
respectively. Multiple sequence alignment analysis of ADS3963 gene
with seven ADS genes already reported has revealed 98 % homology.
ADS3963 (533 aa) protein has shown more than 98%identity
with amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase proteins of other strains of
Artemisia annua L. with respect to amino acid composition (). Phylogenetic tree analysis has shown relatively higher homology
of ADS3963 gene from Artemisia annua L. with sesquiterpene
synthases from angiosperms(). The 6 different types of
domain were found in ADS3963 protein (ACL15394) ( ).

 The highly conserved region, aspartate rich motif (DDxxD position 286­
290), is the characteristic of all terpene synthases []. This motif is
involved in the coordination of the substrate bound divalent metal
ion (Mg2+ and Mn2+) []. Two basic residues Arg264 and Arg441
from 5­epi­aristolochene synthase from Nicotiana tabacum []corresponding to 
Arg249 and Arg427 in ADS3963 protein are brought
close to each other by loop movement (). The deletion of 13
amino acid residues from ADS3963 protein has shown no influence on
its catalytic domains, as they may not constitute the essential
structure or it may be non catalytic site of protein. The presence
of a new motif SlwD, a casein kinase II phosphorylation domain site
at position 104­107 in ADS3963 protein, not found in other terpene
synthase, is a unique finding of our study. It has been shown that the
activity of enzymes of terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in higher
eukaryotes is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.
Enzymes whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation differ both
with respect to the spatial relationship between their active and
regulatory sites and the mechanisms by which phosphorylation
modulates activity. Therefore, the presence of new site present in
ADS3963 protein suggested it may be part of regulatory region
of the enzyme and the DDxxD may be the part of active site for
binding of the substrate.

The three­dimensional )3D( structure of protein is of major
importance in providing insights into their molecular functions. The
result showed that the putative ADS3963 protein contains 72 % of α­helices, 
23 % β­turns and 26 % of random coils ().
Penetrating through most part of the secondary structure, α ­ helices
and random coils are the most abundant structural elements of
ADS3963, while β turns are intermittently distributed in protein. The
total energy values of the predicted 3D model of ADS protein
were calculated as 93 % before energy minimization and 90 % after
energy minimization from Ramachandran plot. The refined model of
ADS3963, analyzed by VADAR for the evaluation of the
Ramachandran plot quality, was found to be satisfactory based on
expected values representing those numbers which would be
expected for highly refined X­Ray and NMR protein structure
(). The description of reaction regulation in enzymes
responsible for activating and catalyzing small molecules requires
identification of ligand movement into the binding site and out of
the enzyme through specific channels and docking sites.

Recent studies have revealed that the core sequences of many
proteins were nearly optimized for stability by natural evolution.
Surface residues, by contrast, were not so optimized, presumably
because protein function is mediated through surface interactions with
other molecules. Here, we sought to determine the extent to which the
sequences of protein ligand­binding and enzyme active sites could be
predicted by optimization of scoring functions based on protein
ligand­binding affinity rather than structural stability []. In an
attempt to find the possible binding sites of FPP on Amorpha­4, 11­diene synthase (ADS3963), PASS was performed. The output of
PASS contains center coordinates for 17 binding sites. Docking of
FPP was performed with respect to all the 17 binding sites of the
enzyme (). The aim of molecular docking is to achieve an
optimized conformation for both the protein, ligand and relative
orientation between protein and ligand such that the free energy of the
overall system is minimized. Lower energy corresponds to better
binding therefore; initial six of these binding sites ()were
studied for the interaction with FPP (). Based on the
docking studies the following stretches are Ala 321­Ala324­ Lys­398;
Ala 234­Val237­Phe283­Thr286­Tyr­287; Ser94­Met95­Trp141­
Trp430­Asn434; Ser94­Arg96­ Glu104­Leu107­Lys142­Lys431;
Lys137­Arg143­Ile147­Ala150­Gln151­Leu478 and Ser218­
Gly219­ Tyr224­Arg228­Cys352­Met356­Aln450 may constitute to
substrate binding. These results may have implications for
understanding the role of amorpha ­4, 11­diene synthase in cyclization
of FPP.

Conclusions
Amorpha­4,11­diene synthase in A. annua L. plants is reported to be
a key regulatory enzyme, catalyzing the rate­limiting step in the
biosynthesis of artemisinin. In this study, we conclude that the
putative amorpha­4,11­diene synthase gene (ADS3963) cloned by us
from high artemisinin (0.7­0.9 % dry wt basis) yielding strain of A.
annua L. plant is evolutionary conserved, as suggested by
phylogenetic analysis. It encodes a protein of 533 amino acid residues
with conserved domain DDxxD. The absence of thirteen amino acids
in this protein has resulted into the formation of a new motif, SlwD,
which might have role in regulating the active state of the enzyme.
This finding of our study also indicates that ADS3963 protein may be
an isoform. These results, however, has to be corroborated with wet
lab data. Further, if the structure and function of ADS3963 protein is
understood, it can serve as model to study other related enzymes and
could be utilized to develop new functional approaches for overexpression
of this key enzyme leading to enhanced synthesis and
accumulation of artemisinin in A. annua L. plants.
