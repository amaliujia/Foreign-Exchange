Background
The basic format underling information in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank is a flat file. The correspondence between individual flat file formats 
facilitated the exchange of data between each of these datasets []. GenBank
describes each sequence entry with literature reference, functional data, location of mRNA coding regions and sequence 
[]. Similarly, EMBL [] 
and DDBJ [] are also resources for biological and medical research data. The
sequence file format conversion with tools like READSEQ [], FMTSEQ 
[] and SeqVerter [] are 
described in detail. Here, we describe BIOFFORC as a file format converter.

Methodology
Process flow
A process flow for the tool is shown in .

Web interface
The current version of BIOFFORC is a web based tool and it uses a common gateway interface (CGI) developed in
PERL.

Input and output
The use of the tool to convert a GenBank format to FASTA format is shown in . 
The top panel in  shows input in GenBank Format and the bottom panel shows output in FASTA 
format.

Caveats and Future development
The present version of BIOFFORC allows format conversion for four formats. We propose to expand conversion capability to several 
other required formats.
