Background
Indian major carp, Labeo rohita (Hamilton-Buchanan, 1822),
commonly known as ‘rohu’ belongs to the family Cyprinidae is
available in lakes, ponds, rivers and other water bodies of India
and adjacent countries []. It is a highly preferred carp and
fetches high market price. India is by far the largest producer of
rohu, followed by Bangladesh and Myanmar. Although a
considerable work has been carried out on various aspects
including aquaculture, biology, seed production etc., however
the species has not been adequately studied with respect to its
genome, proteome and transcriptome that may provide critical
information for enhancing its aquaculture productivity, growth,
disease resistance and other traits.

Identification and characterization of transcriptome of L. rohita
can provide valuable information to undertake future research
in functional genomics. Transcriptome explores the part of the
genome that is functionally active in a particular tissue 
[]. An
expressed sequence tag (EST) is a fraction of a transcribed
cDNA sequence [] and important for identification of
transcripts of a gene []. Large-scale EST data represents a
snapshot of the transcriptome of an organism while cloning and
sequencing of ESTs is also an effective approach for the
recovery of full length cDNA, discovery of novel genes and
molecular markers development []. ESTs being one of the
important genomic resources, their numbers in public databases
are rapidly increasing. Globally, 32,300 fish species have been
described [] that offer a unique opportunity for studies of
transcriptomics, genomics and evolutionary biology in fishes.
Despite, the global importance of fishes, information on
transcriptome is available only for few species [,
]. Therefore,
the utilization of available biological data reported across these
species should be a new starting point for expanding studies in
functional genomics.

In the light of above, we performed transcriptome analysis and
identified differentially expressed genes in different tissues of L.
rohita by utilizing available EST information in other fish
species. Homologous transcripts, similarity with mRNA and
translated product of these ESTs were predicted by the
sequential application of various methodologies. Initially, we
downloaded ESTs of L. rohita from dbEST database with
complete information. We further developed an EST database
using MySQL database management system on Linux platform.
The ESTs sequences were refined by removing vector
contamination segments and assembled into contigs and
singletons. A contig was referred to tentative consensus
sequence [], while both contig and singleton were collectively
considered as putative transcripts (PTs) [], which ultimately
represented subsequence of individual gene. We also analyzed
PTs for repeat motifs and stored them into database along with
PTs sequences. This unique set of sequences were used as query
sequence for analysis such as repetitive motif (microsatellites),
RNA search, and homolog transcript search with zebrafish
dataset and prediction of hypothetical protein and functional
annotation. A total of 92 transcripts of L. rohita were putatively
and functionally annotated using similarity searches, SSRs
mapping and establishment of gene ontology [] relationship.

Methodology
Database design and development:
A database ‘lrest’ was designed in MySQL on Linux to manage
the downloaded EST data in GB and FASTA files. The data was
then parsed through Perl parser according to schema and
managed into database comprised of three tables: ‘fishinfo’ for
physical information of fish, ‘estinfo’ holding the records
related to ESTs information. The database also holds the results
of the analysis in the third table ‘analysis’. Relationships among
the tables were created based on primary and foreign keys. The
diagrammatic representation of data organization and other
details have been explained in ().

Primary analysis:
ESTs collected from dbEST, NCBI in GB (for annotation) and
FASTA (for sequences) format (February 2012) 
[] were used
for analysis. The downloaded EST sequences were cleaned by
using SeqClean program [] and UniVec database 
[]. The
resultant quality ESTs were assembled through CAP3 
[]
assembly program which generated unique gene sequences.
These unique sequences were used as query sequences for
alignment analysis. Further, the singletons and contigs were
analyzed to identify simple sequence repeats (SSR) motifs with
the help of MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA) 
[], a
publicly available Perl script for SSR search within nucleotide
sequences. This program produces types (simple perfect,
compound perfect and imperfect), repeat unit length (mono- to
hexa-nucleotide) and length and repeat sequence class of
microsatellites. The result of Cap3 program related to contig
and singleton and results of the MISA program were managed
into the ‘analysis’ table of the database. We established
relationship of the ‘analysis’ table with other tables through
primary and foreign keys of database ().

Similarity search:
The Refseq_RNA [] and Swiss-Prot 
[] databases provide
more comprehensive, integrated, non-redundant and wellannotated
set of sequences for similarity search. These two
databases along with UniGene [] dataset of zebrafish were
downloaded from ftp server of NCBI (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov). The
annotation of 1387 PTs was performed on the basis of
significant hits using local BLAST [] against Refseq_RNA and
UniGene databases using BLASTn and Swiss-Prot protein
databases using BLASTx. The Nucleotide search against
Refseq_RNA and UniGene databases were obtained on high
threshold score &gt; 250 and identities &gt; 85%, while putative
transcripts were compared against the protein database using
BLASTx with significant matches at a set threshold of score &gt;
100 and identities &gt; 70%.

Analysis programs:
For the detection of number of clustered sequences present in
different contigs the CAP3 assembly files (.cap.ace) were
analyzed using a Perl script (CAP3ResultParser.pl). We wrote
another perl script (TissueStatsClust.pl) program for
manipulation of total number of PTs and ESTs for individual
tissues. A third program ‘AlignmentAnalysis’ was also written
in Perl to generate the information about targeted databases
and detail statistics about alignments by using ‘lrest’ database
in the backend and alignment files. Initially the program took
alignment files generated by BLASTn and BLASTx program for
PTs query against UniGene set of zebrafish and Refseq_RNA
database and Swiss-Prot database respectively. In its first step,
the program separated the hits and non hits PTs sequences
against corresponding target database and subsequently the
program extracted only significant hits on the threshold Score &gt;
250 and Identities &gt; 85% for zebrafish and Refseq_RNA and
alignment Score &gt; 100 and Identities &gt; 70% for Swiss-Prot.
These significant results for all the databases were further
stored in separate files. The program retrieved pre-computed
SSRs from ‘lrest’ database and mapped same motif patterns into
aligned sequences of zebrafish with corresponding PTs for
providing strength to our putative annotation results. The
program ‘AlignmentAnalysis’ used all the three alignments files
and subsequently merged for PTs through corresponding ids,
serving as primary key into table ‘analysis’ of ‘lrest’ database.

Average length of PTs and length range of PTs were also
processed by this program. We also downloaded two files
‘gene2refseq’ and ‘gene2go’ 
from Entrez Gene [] for assigning
the gene ontology terms like biological process, cellular
component and molecular function to the putative transcript in
functional annotation process. A program ‘GOAssign.pl’
written in Perl was used for assigning GeneID and GO terms to
the annotation results with computational mapping of both
files ‘gene2refseq’ and ‘gene2go’().

Results and Discussion
Clustering and SSRs:
The EST data were processed and managed into a database
using MySQL on Linux platform. All cleaned EST sequences
were assembled with CAP3 software that resulted in 184
contigs and 1203 singlets i.e. 1387 unique sequences putatively
corresponding to as many genes with an average length of 542
bp. These 1387 PTs were used to identify SSRs motifs using
MISA program and derived SSRs ranging in length from 2 to 6
bp were considered as repeat motifs. The minimum numbers of
repeats were 6 for dinucleotides, 5 for trinucleotides, and 10 for
tetranucleotides. In SSR analysis, observation was made on
their types (di to tetra nucleotides), number of repeats, and
percentage frequency of occurrences and their distribution in
the sequence. The results of unique sequences (PTs) along with
all SSR information was parsed and manipulated using Perl
parser method according to database schema and data were
managed into a separate table ‘analysis’ of ‘lrest’ database.

The data of table ‘analysis’ were used for further application in
transcriptome analysis study. After analyzing the ESTs, we
found majority of them were from brain (1317) followed by
liver (236), testis (77), spleen (1) and 40 ESTs from unknown
tissue. The organ wise distribution of contigs, singletons and
clustered ESTs were determined through Perl script
‘TissueStasClust.pl’ that uses computational mapping of
accession id and GenBank annotation stored in ‘lrest’. The
contigs derived from more than one organ were not considered
in this statistics obtained by the above program
 (see
supplementary material). Only 1625 ESTs were found
distributed into 168 contigs derived from single organ and 1203
singletons.

Putative annotation:
The annotation of the unique 1387 PTs was done on the basis of
the best match data with Refseq_RNA database using BLASTn.
Only 439 (31.66%) sequences of PTs showed alignment with
2406 sequence of Refseq_RNA database and remaining PTs
showed no hits. Out of 2406 alignments with Refseq_RNA, 664
alignments were obtained for 256 PTs on threshold with
identities &gt; 85% and score &gt; 250 that could be considered as
highly significant homologs. The score &gt; 250 was used so that
the alignment coverage reached 50% of query length to the
target, while identities &gt; 85% provided highly conserved and
homologous sequences.  describes the result of above
alignment generated by ‘AlignmentAnalysis.pl’ which used
blast alignment file for parsing and calculating the statistics of
alignment between query (putative transcript) and target
sequences (selected database). Similarly, 1387 PTs sequences of
L. rohita were aligned with D. rerio dataset of UniGene
collections using a BLASTn with score &gt; 250 and sequence
identities &gt; 85%. A total of 455 (32.81%) PTs overlapped, while
remaining PTs could not align with any of the transcripts of D.
rerio. Out of 701 alignments with D. rerio sequences, 332
alignments were obtained for 258 PTs sequences on above
threshold values. The aligned sequences on above threshold
parameters were considered as highly significant homologs.
 describes the result of above alignment generated by
our own script ‘AlignmentAnalysis.pl’. The pre-computed SSRs
motifs stored in the database were used to map these motifs as
a marker of D. rerio homologous sequences corresponding to
the PTs. In this map we found a strong support to annotate the
gene of L. rohita. Identification of repetitive elements and
nucleotide polymorphisms in query as well as target sequences
provided strong support for annotation.

Hypothetical protein analysis:
Swiss-Prot databases were used for hypothetical protein
prediction for 1387 transcripts query with the help of BLASTx
and program aligned 1102 PTs hits with 36517 protein
sequences with alignment percentage 79.46%. Further, the set
threshold values i.e. score &gt; 100 and identities &gt; 70% for Swiss-
Prot resulted in alignment of 145 PTs with 1900 protein
sequences ().

Comparative analysis and functional annotation:
Alignment of ESTs with Refseq_RNA, D. rerio transcripts and
Swiss-Prot resulted in 256 PTs, 258 PTs and 145 PTs respectively
as significant hits in the similarity search analyses. The pre
computed and stored SSRs of related PTs sequences were
mapped with the aligned transcripts of zebrafish and the
presence of SSRs motifs in corresponding target transcripts
provided strength to this annotation. All significant alignments
were merged with their PT ids and found that only 92 PTs were
common hit for all the three databases and referred to as
annotated on the basis of gene and protein prediction and
mentioned into the supplementary ‘S1.xls’available with us.
Functional categorization of predicted protein sequences for 92
PTs was done through gene ontology terms like biological
process, cellular component and molecular function. The
Program ‘GOAssign.pl’ efficiently mapped gene ontology terms
for 44 PTs sequences and result about gene ontology has been
mentioned into the supplementary file ‘S2.xls’ available with us.

Our final result based on putative and functional annotation of
transcriptome of L. rohita for 92 PTs was executed and the
analysis was supported by several approaches for
transcriptome and proteome based similarity searches as well
as computational mapping of SSRs and gene ontology. The
annotated results were explained in the supplementary file S1.
We identified several genes and proteins along with function,
process and location based on high identities (85-94%) and
matches (70-95%) in the similarity search, e.g. Contig93
(HO758335; HO758369; HO758347) as protein L40-1, Contig120
(GR977092; HO758682) as L29, Singlet1101 (HO762402) as L5a,
Singlet1176 (JK492853) as L28-like and L32, Singlet290
(GR958016) as L17, Singlet478(GR977096) as L36a, Singlet595
(HO758410) as L38, Singlet965 (HO762207) as L35, Singlet826
(HO758770) as S6 ribosomal protein or transcript variant 1,
Singlet79 (GR426887) as ribosomal protein S16, Singlet814
(HO758752) as ribosomal protein S33. Additionally few
important orthologous genes viz. Singlet288 (GR958013),
Singlet1001 (HO762255), Singlet686 (HO758554) on high
identities &gt; 92% were also annotated as heat shock protein
(HSPs) associated with cell stress and cell growth 
[].
Similarly, we identified protein specific for biotic stress viz.
Singlet311 (GR958037) as thioredoxin-like 1, Singlet777
(HO758701) as F-box protein 11a (fbxo11a), Singlet315
(GR958041) as CoA synthetase family member 2 (acsf2),
Singlet1046 (HO762321) as 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-
monooxygenase activation protein, gamma polypeptide 2
(ywhag2) and Contig92 (HO762389; HO762458) as highmobility
group box 3b.

Likewise annotation of some PTs lead to identification of
important proteins such as Contig184 (HO758515; HO758524
HO758557; HO758384; HO758383) as Ependymin, Singlet985
(HO762234) as coiled-coil domain-containing protein,
Singlet786 (HO758714) as fibroblast growth factor 8 /androgeninduced
growth factor, Singlet1169 (JK492845) as ba2 globin
and ba1 globin, Contig105 (HO762218; HO762362; JK492857;
JK492849; HO758519; GR958118) as hemoglobin alpha adult-1,
Contig163 (HO758295 HO762456 GR463879) as fatty acidbinding
protein, Singlet780 (HO758705) as PKR-interacting
protein 1, Contig92 (HO762389 HO762458) as high-mobility
group. The Contig68 (HO758673; HO762228) showed 529
matches on identities 91% to D. rerio NADH dehydrogenase
(ubiquinone) Fe-S protein 4. The NADH dehydrogenase is
associated with the electron transport chain reaction and
involved in the glucose metabolism of spermatogenic cells.

Conclusion
Out of 1387 putative transcripts, 256 PTs showed alignment
with 664 Refseq_RNA, 258 sequences were aligned with 332
homologous transcripts of D. rerio UniGene sets and 145 PTs
with 1900 proteins of Swiss-Prot based on significant similarity
searches. Among these only 92 (5.8%) transcripts (13 contigs
and 79 singletons) were aligned with all the databases and thus
fully annotated. While a significant fraction of ESTs data could
not be identified by similarity searches, the unidentified
transcripts are valuable resource and can also be taken up for re
sequencing, if found important in expression profiling.
