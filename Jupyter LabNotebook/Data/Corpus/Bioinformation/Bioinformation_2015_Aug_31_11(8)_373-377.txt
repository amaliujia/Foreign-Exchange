antibiotic treatment. The alpha hemolysin or alpha toxin damages cell membrane and induces apoptosis and degradation of DNA.
The titer of alphahemolysin increases and causes hemostasis disturbances, thrombocytopenia, and pulmonary lesions during
staphylococcal infection. Therefore, it is of interest to inhibit alpha hemolysin using novel compounds. We used the structure of
alpha hemolysin(PDB: 7AHL) to screen structures for 100,000 compounds from the ZINC database using molecular docking with
AutoDock VINA. Nine (9) successive hits were then subjected for pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties by PROTOX (a
webserver for the prediction of oral toxicities of small molecules) and FAFDrugs (a tool for prediction of ADME and Toxicity). This
exercise further identified hit #1 ({[3a-(Dihydroxymethyl)-6-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-1,3,4-trioxatetrahydro-2H-pentalen-5-
yl]methyl}amino(9H-fluoren-9-yl)acetate with binding affinity: -10.3 kcal/mol) and hit #2 (6-(Dihydroxymethyl)-2-{2-[3-
(methylamino)propyl]-2-azatricyclo[9.4.0.03,8]pentadeca-1(11),3,5,7,12,14-hexaen-6-yloxy}tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol with
binding affinity: -9.6 kcal/mol) with acceptable toxicity and ADME properties for potential predicted hemolysin inhibition. These
compounds should then be evaluated in vitro using inhibitory studies.

Background
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium and a
member of the Firmicutes. It is frequently found in human skin
and repository tracts [1&amp;
2]. Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen among
patients with skin and soft tissue infections [3]. Pathogenicity
of Staphylococcus aureus is closely associated with toxin
production. It secretes variety of exotoxins including super
antigens [4], toxic shock syndromes 
[5], enterotoxins 
[6],
exfoliative toxins [7], alpha toxin 
[8], beta toxin and delta toxin
[9]. Moreover, this pathogene laborates
immunoevasiveproteins such as protein-A [10]. Methicillin-
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycinresistant
Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) strains of this bacterium
is clinical problem. Anti-biotic resistant Infection-related
mortality rate estimated at approximately 13% equal to
approximately 2 to 10 deaths annually per 100,000 population
[11]. Deactivation of secreted exotoxins will reduce clinical
effects.Among exotoxins, alpha hemolysin is the major
cytotoxic agent released by Staphylococcus aureus and is a
member of pore forming beta barrel toxin family [12]. The
structure of this protein has been solved by X-ray
crystallography. About 68 % of its structure consists of beta
sheets. Seven monomers of secreted alpha toxin contribute to
build a heptameric hairpin like structure. The heptameric form
of alpha toxin tends to enter the hydrophobic cell membrane
and make a pore with 14 angstrom diameter which is large
enough for ion exchange [13]. Damaging to cell membrane
makes it unstable and leads to ionic imbalance. This toxin also
can induce apoptosis in human T-cell and monocytes. It has
shown that incubation of T-cells and alpha toxin leads to
initiation of apoptosis by intrinsic cell death pathway [14]. In
addition it activates caspase 8 and caspase 9 and subsequently
caspase 3 which leads to DNA degradation following
apoptosis. As a complementary, inhibition of alpha toxin is
required to reduce side effects. In an in vivo study for finding
inhibitors of this toxin, cyclodextrincholesterol (CDcholesterol)
reported as the potent inhibitor of this toxin [15].
CD-cholesterol deactivated the pore forming potential of the
toxin. In another study, aromatic polysulphonic acids could
inhibit the lethal activity of alpha toxin in mice [16]. Different
polysulphonic acid compounds showed varied inhibitory
effects. After low concentration injection to mice, the side
effects related to pore formation were reduced. Also it is
shown that apigenin, a compound extracted from parsley, can
inhibit the production of alpha toxin and reduce side effects of
staphylococcal infection [17]. 
In this in silico study first we tried
to simulate biological condition for a monomer of alpha toxin.
Because the heptameric form of alpha toxin is a pore forming
structure, the strategy of the presented study is to use
simulation tools to prevent formation of heptameric structure.
To do this, we used high throughput molecular docking for
finding potential ligands which binds to the single monomer
structure. Then further pharmacokinetic and toxicity analyses
were applied to introduce final potential drug like chemicals
against alpha toxin of Staphylococcus aureus.

Methodology
Protein and ligands structure:
Crystal structure of Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin in
heptameric transmembrane pore obtained from protein data
bank (www.rcsb.org/) with pdb code: 7AHL. The model
quality was X-ray diffraction with the resolution of 1.89 Å. This
structure was in homo heptameric form and just one monomer
extracted and was used as the template for further study. The
monomeric structure was then solved in a water box and
neutralized with Na+ and/or Cl- by using Chimera software.
The ligand library for virtual screening was constructed based
on a subset of drug-like compounds derived from zinc
database containing 100000 chemicals [18].

Virtual screening:
For virtual screening purpose, we used PyRX software 
[19].
PYRX includes AutoDock [20] andAutoDockvina 
[21] and its
scoring function is based on Lamarckian genetic algorithm.
More information about Lamarckian scoring function is
provided in supplementary data. In this research we used
AutoDockVina for molecular docking method. Before
initiation of docking operation charge calculated and assigned
to protein and ligand structures by AutoDockVina software.
Also a big docking radius with a volume of 30 Å and
coordinate of X: 31.25, Y: 24.75 and Z: 28.04 was used to cover
interacting area of monomers. For simulation of biological
condition, docking operation was performed in the presence of
water molecules and neutralizing ions.

Pharmacokinetic analysis:
Successive hits of virtual screening data were then analyzed
regarding liberation, absorption, distribution and
metabolization properties. To do this, FAFDrugs3 web server
was used [22]. The ligands were checked for ADME properties
in optimal descriptors (hydrogen bonds, charge) in pH=7.4.
Also the toxicity properties and probable accessorial targets of
successive hits were analyzed by PROTOX web server [23].

Results &amp; Discussion
For virtual screening purpose, biological conditions were
simulated by adding water box and neutralizing ions. So with
the most probability it can be suggested that the provided
binding ΔG are close to in vitro condition. Among 100.000 drug
like chemicals, 9 ligands with highest binding affinity were
selected for further study. Table 1 (see supplementary
material) describes binding avidity of top 9 successive hits.
Figure 1 depicts the structure of top 3 hits in contact with
alpha toxin. Although in this study we obtained 9 potential
inhibitors we focused on highly specific hits. According to
table 1, top 4, hits in comparison with others indicated
considerable difference in binding affinity. So we selected top 4
successive hits for further study. Top 4 hits were then analyzed
regarding oral toxicity level and the ligand 1 reached the LD50
of 150mg/kg with the toxicity class 3 (1: most toxic and 6: safe).
Furthermore, no protein target has been found for this hit. In
other words this chemical had not any predicted target in
human proteins. This ligand directly interacts with Thr 109,
Thr 155 and Ser 106 with hydrogen bond and makes an
electrostatic interaction with Lys 154 furthermore it interacts
with Pro151 and Val 149 by steric interaction, It is probable
that the pharmacophore model of this hit does not match to
any vital human proteins. The pharmacokinetic and toxicity
analysis indicated that this ligand is an appropriate candidate
for further in vitro study. But it is clear that the further in vitro
study of this ligand requires reduction in its toxicity level. The
second hit reached the LD50 of 733mg/kg and its toxicity class
predicted 4. The LD50 indicates that this ligand has less
toxicity than first hit. Interestingly no human protein target has
been predicted for this ligand either. The less toxicity enables
ligand 2 to be considered as a drug candidate for further study.
This ligand makes 3 hydrogen bonds with Thr 109, Thr 155
and Ser106 and directly engages in interaction with Asp 108
and Lys 154 by electrostatic bond. Moreover it interacts with
Val 149, Pro 151 and Lys 154 by steric, interaction. The ligand 3
which passed the pharmacokinetic tests of FAFdrugs3,
indicated high toxicity value in PROTOX. Its toxicity level was
predicted in level 1 with the LD50 of 5 mg/kg. The high
toxicity value of this ligand was due to its pharmacophore
properties which were 44.72% fit with Amine Oxidase A and
40.26% fit with Prostaglandin G/H Synthase 1. This ligand
makes 3 hydrogen bonds with Thr 155, Asp108 and Lys 110
and also 3 steric interactions with Ser 106, Asp 108 and Thr
155. Because of high toxicity value, this ligand is not a good
candidate in order to be used as a base structure for rational
drug design purposes. Moreover the toxicity analysis results of
fourth successive hit indicated LD50 of 3750 mg/kg with the
toxicity level 5. Among all 100.000 virtual screening candidate
chemicals, this ligand could rank as a successive hit and pass
pharmacokinetic test and interestingly reached the least
toxicity level. But it is remarkable that the pharmacophore
model of ligand 4 fits 28.76% to its human target Amine
Oxidase A. This ligand contacts with Ser 106, Thr 109 and Val
149 by hydrogen bond and makes steric interactions with Thr
155, Val 149 and Tyr 148. The overall properties of 4 described
ligands are available in Table 2 (see supplementary material).

Although previously some inhibitors of alpha toxin were
reported the demand of new specific inhibitors are still
perceptible, Before a clinical study a wide range of primary
structure is needed to be tested in in silico and in vivo
conditions regarding cyto-toxicity. Variation in inhibitor
structures helps to reach proper lead compounds. CDcholesterol
which has been previously reported as the potent
inhibitor, has a hydrophobic structure by nature. So it is mostly
probable that it binds to hydrophobic transmembrane, region
of toxin structure by hydrophobic interactions. Apigenin (4׳, 5,
7-trihydroxyflavone) also has a hydrophobic sterol like
structure and it prevents production of Alpha hemolysin. So
the application of Apigenin after toxin production by bacteria,
would not be helpful for inactivation of heptamer toxin
molecules. The found inhibitors of this study bind to the
structure of alpha toxin not only by hydrophobic interactions
and as depicted in figure1, hydrogen bonds as well as steric
interactions plus electrostatic interactionsare tightly engaged
in interaction with alpha toxin structure. It leads to more
specific interaction with the target exactly in monomers
interacting area. In comparison with Apigenin and CDcholesterol,
the presented successive hits theoretically prevents
active form (heptamer) assembly by a more specific
pharmacophore fit. So if the further required in vivo
experiments validates these hits as a drug, they can be used
after invasion and toxin production by bacteria to inhibit
hemolysin process. Also the top found inhibitors passed in
silico tests, but further modifications will help to reach a better
fit to the target.

Conclusion
The circulating secreted alpha hemolysin toxin from
Staphylococcus aureus causes side effects even after antibiotic
treatments. Therefore, there is a need to inhibit alpha
hemolysin using novel compounds. A molecular docking
based screening of compounds from the ZINC database
against the known hemolysin toxin structure identified two
hits with predicted binding values -10.3 kcal/mol (hit #1) and -
9.6 kcal/mol (hit #2) having acceptable toxicity and ADME
properties for further consideration.
