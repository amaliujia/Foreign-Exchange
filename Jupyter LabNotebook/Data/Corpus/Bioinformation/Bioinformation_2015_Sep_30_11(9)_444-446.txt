provide information about 7,847 sequence-tagged site (STS) markers identified in the 11 species using a next generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies. The database consists of three major functional categories: keyword search, detailed viewer and download
function. The molecular marker annotation table provides detailed information such as ownership information, basic information,
and STS-related characterization information.

Availability
The database is available for free at http://nabic.rda.go.kr/Molecularmarker

Background
A molecular marker is a fragment of DNA that is associated
with a certain location within the genome. In general,
molecular markers are used in molecular biology to identify a
particular sequence in a pool of unknown DNA. Molecular
markers are widely used in genetic studies of agricultural
plants. Advancement in the next generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies integrated with tools like association mapping
studies. The NGS method is far more powerful than any
existing in generating DNA markers [1]. Of currently available
markers are based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
such as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP),
random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified
fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), sequence-tagged site
(STS), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS),
microsatellites or simple sequence repeat (SSR), and single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [2]. A STS marker is a short
DNA sequence that has a single occurrence in the genome and
whose location and base sequence are known. The STS marker
can be easily detected using specific primers, and they are
useful for developing physical map of a genome [3]. Molecular
markers have been increasingly used in genetic studies of crop
species for their applicability in breeding programs. These
markers have been developed and used for the improvement of
agricultural species, disease resistance, food quality and
environmental stress traits have been considered [4].
Considering the significance of molecular marker database, the
National Agricultural Biotechnology Information Center
(NABIC) previously provided a function for RSN marker
discovery across the rice and Chinese cabbage genome [5].
Recently, we have released a major update that comprises
various new features for annotation including 11 species STS
molecular markers analysis information. The molecular marker
database has expanded its archives to the other species, which
will be discussed below.

Methodology
Data collection:
The information on molecular markers was collectively
acquired from the research projects supported by Next-
Generation BioGreen 21 Program (http://www. tagc.or.kr/)
and post-genome project (http://atis.rda. go.kr/) of Rural
Development Administration. A total of 7,847 molecular
markers were collected from non-redundant genes for rice
(Oryza sativa, 7418 records), small sea snails (Hemifusus tuba,
12 records), chili pepper (Capsicum chinense, 116 records), bell
pepper (Capsicum annuum, 3 records), cattle (Bos taurus, 57
records), pear (Pyrus pyrifolia, 26 records), grass (Miscanthus,
201 records), spider mite (Tetranychus urticae, 2 records), wild
soybean (Glycine soja, 5 records), soybean (Glycine max, 5
records), and Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa, 2 records).

Database design:
Using the collected molecular markers, a database was
constructed using BioSQL schema to covering public and
private platforms. Its platform for the web server was
developed using MySQL for PHP environment and database
handling. We developed a web-based system to enable searches
for agricultural markers and to provide various services. The
molecular marker database can be accessed freely through
NABIC portals (http://nabic.rda.go.kr/Molecularmarker)
without any license fees. No prior registration is required.

Implementation and Features:
The STS marker database features three major functions such as
marker search, detailed viewer, and data download (Figure 1).
Through marker search, users can easily access specific
molecular markers information among 7,847 molecular markers
in 11 species. Specifically, this database supports various
keyword search methods consisting of seven identification
categories such as ID, source, pecies, type, content, publication
date, and ownership. For example, if ‘Bos taurus’ is entered as a
query in the species of marker search, a summarized table is
generated, as shown in Figure 1.

Clicking on ID shows the detailed information of molecular
markers, such as ownership information, basic information,
and sequence-tagged site (STS) data (Figure 2).

Utility, caveats and future developments:
The molecular marker database provides detailed information
on STS molecular markers of agricultural species and has three
major utility features (marker search, detailed viewer, and
download function). Using molecular marker database, user
can easily searched for tracking of new structures of the
chromosomes and positional function of genes. In the future,
NABIC continually provides related services to professional
genomic research institutes and societies. We plan to integrate
the detailed information on molecular markers for agricultural
breeding and provide them through a user-friendly platform
with various multi-search options online.

This study was conducted with support from the Research
Program for Agricultural Science &amp; Technology Development
(Project No.PJ010112) of the National Academy of Agricultural
Science, Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea.
