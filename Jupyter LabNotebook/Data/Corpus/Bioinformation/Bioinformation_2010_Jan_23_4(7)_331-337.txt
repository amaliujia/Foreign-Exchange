Background
Decoding the genomes of human and other model organisms have
produced increasingly large volumes of data relevant for
understanding natural selection, development and evolution, the
causation of disease, and the interplay between genotypes and
phenotypes during development. Collectively, this information reflects
the current state of knowledge on the genetic and genome attributes of
organisms. The huge amount of accumulated data represents a
goldmine for the study of molecular evolution [],[], disease-specific
mutations [], [], [] and 
biodiversity measurements [], []. While
much progress has been made in genomic research, increasing
evidence have shown that the study of gene factors by itself is
insufficient in explaining all aspects of heritable changes in phenotype,
gene function or gene expression. It is now known that chemical
modifications of DNA and histones can modify gene activity through
alterations in chromatin structure that blocks or promotes
transcriptional initiation []. Enzymes involved in this process include
DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases, histone acetylases,
histone methyltransferases and the methyl-binding domain protein
MECP2 [].

The need to identify chemical modifications that can alter gene
activity and expression has given rise to the field called epigenetics.
This form of second-order genetics provides a whole new dimension
to genes beyond the genome, and proposes a control system of genetic
 ’switches ‘ for regulating gene expression. Epigenetics, first defined by
Conrad Waddington in 1942, refers to the study of epigenesis, i.e.,
how genotypes give rise to phenotypes through programmed change
[]. At the heart of this new wave of research is the “study of
mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that
cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence” []. Recent data
have shown that epigenetic modulations are essential in many
developmental processes, including tissue formation, organ formation
and allele-specific gene expression []. Changes in these normal
epigenetic patterns can deregulate patterns of gene expression,
resulting in adverse clinical outcomes []. Increasing evidence
indicates that such mechanisms play important roles in psychiatric
disorders [], obesity [], life experiences [] and the etiology of
diseases such as cancer [], schizophrenia [], Beckwith-
Wiedemann syndrome [] and Alzheimer's disease [].

Epigenetics is highly combinatorial in nature due to the array of
diverse control elements. The human genome contains ∽23,000 genes
that are active in specific cells at precise moments. Cells control gene
expression by wrapping DNA around clusters of core histone proteins
to form nucleosomes [], which are then organized into chromatin.
Changes to the structure of chromatin affect gene expression patterns:
genes are inactivated when the chromatin is condensed, and they are
expressed when chromatin is relaxed "R[]. These dynamic chromatin
states are controlled by DNA methylation [], histone modifications
(e.g., methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation and
ubiquitylation) [], [] and DNA-binding proteins (e.g., polycomb
and trithorax group proteins) []. Most of these epigenetic
modification mechanisms have been shown to be regulated by noncoding
RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), small RNAs
(guide RNAs, piRANS) and large RNAs, which play important roles
in events including transposon activity and silencing, position effect
variegation, X-chromosome inactivation and paramutation [].

With the rapid increase in the number of new modification sites being
discovered each year, it has been suggested that post-translational
modification may affect almost every solvent-accessible histone
residue, allowing a high level of variability for signal transduction
events [], []. This enormous combinatorial 
complexity []
requires an extraordinarily large number of experiments, such as DNA
methylation profiling, for systematic studies. Already, a number of
large-scale initiatives have been established for the systematic
mapping of epigenomic and related data. These include projects by the
Alliance for the Human Epigenome and Disease (AHEAD) Task Force
[], the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project
Consortium [], the Human Epigenome Project (HEP) Consortium
[] and the Highthroughput Epigenetic Regulatory Organisation In
Chromatin (HEROIC) Project Consortium []. The huge quantity of
experimental data generated by these and other projects requires
appropriate bioinformatics infrastructure spanning general and
specialist databases, basic bioinformatics tools and sophisticated
algorithms for meaningful analysis, modeling and prediction of DNAprotein
interactions. Pioneering efforts in the field of computational
epigenetics have been reviewed by Bock and Lengauer []. Here, we
review major tools and resources that have been developed in this
rapidly growing field, with special analysis on the latest trends and
future directions.

Data sources for Epigenetic research
Large amount of data relevant for epigenetic research are available in
scientific literature, molecular databases and case reports. Scientific
literature serves as the primary source of data, providing high-level
descriptions of biological entities and processes. As of January 2009,
PubMed contained over 288,000 records related to epigenetic research.
This information exists in the form of unstructured free text that makes
the extraction of biologically meaningful information difficult. As the
amount of electronically accessible textual material accumulates, the quality of epigenetic research will be increasingly dependent on the
ability to retrieve quality data to facilitate the discovery of new facts,
interpretation of results, and design of experiments [].

The number and size of molecular databases have been increasing
steadily. A total of 1,078 molecular biology databases are currently
(March 2009) described in the Nucleic Acids Research online
Molecular Biology Database Collection []. These include 3
nucleotide sequence databases, 60 databases on transcriptional
regulatory sites and transcription factors, 65 databases on microarray
data and gene expressions, and 114 databases on human genes and
diseases. The international collaborative GenBank [], DNA Data
Bank of Japan (DDBJ) [] and EMBL [] serve as worldwide
repositories for nucleotide sequences of different origins.

A number of epigenetic databases have been reported. We have
reviewed some of these databases (Table 1  in ). DNA methylation databases are useful for studying the
covalent modification of a cell's genetic material, particularly in the
complex genomes of higher order vertebrates. Important sources of
DNA methylation databases include MethDB [], MethPrimerDB
[] and MethyLogiX [], which contains information on DNA
methylation genes and patterns across different species, individuals,
tissue and cell types and phenotypes. Histone databases are important
for research in the compaction and accessibility of eukaryotic and
probably archaeal genomic DNA. The National Human Genome
Research Institute (NHGRI)'s Histone Database [], [] serves as a
central data source for histones and histone fold-containing proteins.
Cancer methylation databases are valuable for analyzing irregular
methylation patterns that are correlated with various cancers. Major
data sources include PubMeth [] and MeInfoText [], which
contains information on gene methylation profiles of specific cancer
types. Online resources for cell-, disease-, organism- and stagespecific
gene expression patterns are also available. The National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) [] serves as a central repository for highthroughput
gene expression data. It also stores high-throughput
functional genomic data such as genome copy number variations,
chromatin structure, methylation status and transcription factor
binding. The Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas (GENSAT) []
provides information about the precise distributions of specific genes
and proteins throughout brain development. StemBase [] details
gene expression data of stem cells and derivatives from rat, mouse and
human. The Gene Normal Tissue Expression (GeneNote) database
[] contains complete gene expression profiles in healthy human
tissues (bone marrow, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas,
prostate, skeletal muscle, spinal cord, spleen and thymus) using the
Affymetrix GeneChip HG-U95 set. The BloodExpress database []
details information about mouse blood cell expression profiles,
including both progenitors and terminally differentiated cells, derived
from array experiments and independent studies. Such information
allows for the identification of dynamic changes in gene expression
during cell differentiation down the hematopoietic hierarchy. Other
data sources exist and have been reviewed elsewhere [].

Computational tools for Epigenetic research
Numerous computational, mathematical and statistical methods,
ranging from data mining, sequence analysis, molecular interactions,
to complex system-level simulations, have been reported in the
literature. Efforts have been channeled into the text mining of
epigenetic information, though development in this field is still at an
early stage. Current efforts are primarily focused on the extraction and
analysis of DNA methylation patterns in various cancer types [],
[]. Traditional sequence analysis tools, such as ClustalW [],
BLAST software suite [], BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool)
[] and MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) [],
allow for the inference of functional, structural, or evolutionary
relationships between DNA or protein sequences. Such methods are
employed in diverse applications, and have been applied to homology
searches of ortholog candidates for the KEGG/GENES database [],
predicting the secondary structures of histone deacetylases [],
homology modeling of DNA methyltransferases [], and optimizing
the activities of histone deacetylase inhibitors [].

Computational models have been used extensively to support various
epigenome mapping initiatives such as chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP)-on-chip [], ChIP-seq [] and bisulfite sequencing [].
ChIP-on-chip is a microarray-based platform that allows the
identification of DNA-protein binding sites on a genome-wide level
[]. The main computational tools that have been developed for
ChIP-on-chip analysis are focused on the identification of ChIP
enrichment sites. Examples include Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation
On Tiled arrays (ChIPOTle) [], TileMap [] and Ringo []. ChIPseq
is a variant of ChIP-on-chip that uses high-throughput DNA
sequencing for detecting differences between sample and control DNA
[]. Although such an approach requires minimal data processing and
allows analysis to be made directly from sequence read counts [], a
critical issue that needs to be resolved is the accurate mapping of short
sequence reads to the reference genome. Algorithms that can identify
regions of similarity between sequences such as BLASTN [] and
BLAT [] are valuable for speeding up this process. Efforts are also
channeled into the development of specialized algorithms for shortread
assembly. Examples include QPalma [] and AMOScmp [].
Bisulfite sequencing [] employs the use of bisulfite treatment of
DNA to detect cytosine methylation patterns. Computational tools that
focus on bisulfite sequencing include methods for data processing and
quality assessment. The basic methods for bisulfite sequence analysis
allow the quantitative measurement of cytosine methlylation levels
[], estimating the effectiveness of bisulfite treatment [], and
visualization of results []. Collectively, the developed algorithms
enable the analysis of DNA methylation patterns of different tissue
types [] and the genome-wide comparison of histone modification
sites identified by various epigenome mapping initiatives [].

Computational analysis of DNA methylation
DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of genomic
stability and cellular plasticity []. It is essential for normal cell
development and is associated with numerous fundamental processes
including genomic imprinting [], X-chromosome inactivation [],
maintenance of repetitive elements [] and carcinogenesis []. DNA
methylation is mainly accomplished by the transfer of methyl groups
from S-adenosyl-methionine to the 5 position of the cytosine
pyrimidine ring in a reaction catalyzed by a DNA methyltransferase or
methylase []. In mammals, four active DNA methyltransferases
(DNMT) have been identified, namely DNMT1, 2, 3A and 3B [],
[]. DNMT1 is the most commonly found DNA methyltransferases
in mammals, and predominantly methylates hemimethylated CpG dinucleotides.
DNMT2 has been identified as a DNA methyltransferases
homolog that methylates cytosine-38 in the anticodon loop of aspartic
acid transfer RNA instead of DNA [], while, DNMT3A and
DNMT3B are de novo methyltransferases that act on both
hemimethylated and unmethylated CpG sites [], [].

A variety of methods for the modeling and prediction of DNA
methylation patterns have been reported. An example is the use of
linear discriminant analysis and artificial neural networks (ANN) for
the classification of individual lung cancer cell lines []. The use of
support vector machines (SVM) for genomic mapping of methylation
patterns for all 22 human autosomes has also been described []. In
recent years, there has been increasing focus on the development of
computational technologies that facilitates the prediction of protein
methylation sites. These include procedures based on support vector
machines (SVM), hidden Markov models (HMM), ANNs, naïve
bayes, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors and decision trees [],
[], []. However, the implementation of such systems is difficult
due to the lack of publicly available experimental data for model construction. Many such systems are currently focused on arginine and
lysine methylations as their mechanisms are currently the best
understood and experimental data is most readily available [], [].
Epigenome prediction pipeline that integrates DNA methylation,
polymerase II preinitiation complex binding, histone H3K4 di- and
trimethylation, histone H3K9/14 acetylation, DNase I hypersensitivity
and SP1 binding has also been reported []. Currently, the relative
value of such computational tools remains unknown. As experimental
data becomes increasingly available, the usefulness of these
technologies will become clearer and it should be expected that more
integrative models will be made available and that current models will
also be refined.

Computational analysis of histone modifications
Histones are the main protein components of chromatin. They play a
key role in the compaction and accessibility of eukaryotic and
probably archaeal genomic DNA [], and are subject to a wide
variety of post-translational modifications including methylation,
acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation and ubiquitylation [],
[]. Covalent modifications of the histone proteins take place
primarily within the histone amino-terminal regions that protrude from
the surface of the nucleosome as well as the globular core region [],
[]. Histone modifications may affect chromosome function via two
distinct mechanisms []. First, they may alter its electrostatic
properties, resulting in a change in the histone structure or its DNAbinding
activity. Second, they may generate binding surfaces for
protein recognition modules, and help engage specific functional
complexes to their relevant sites of action.

There is intense interest in the use of informatics for the analysis,
modeling and prediction of histone modifications in DNA sequences.
Cellular automata have been described for examining a variety of
epigenetic modifications. For example, Sneppen and coworkers []
reported the use of a simplified stochastic model to examine the
conditions for bistability and heredity of nucleosome modificationbased
epigenetic memory. The team demonstrated that robust
bistability required cooperativity of two or more modified
nucleosomes in the modification reactions, and that nucleosomes
occasionally stimulate modifications beyond their neighbor
nucleosomes. Comparative genomics has taken advantage of new
technologies to help identify histone marks and regulatory elements in
higher eukaryotic genomes. Schübeler and colleagues [] have
performed a genome-wide comparison of chromatin structures in
higher eukaryotes. Their work revealed the existence of a binary
pattern of histone modifications among euchromatic genes, with active
genes being hyperacetylated at H3/4 and hypermethylated at H3, and
inactive genes being hypomethylated and deacetylated at the same
locations. Roh et al. [] reported a genome-wide mapping technique
to determine the distribution of lysine-9/14-diacetylated histone H3 in
human peripheral T cells. The team showed that this form of
chromatin modification is correlated with active gene promoters and
with regulatory elements associated with gene expression. In a followup
study, the team extended their work to the genome-wide screening
of conserved and non-conserved enhancers by histone acetylation
patterns [].

The design of machine-learning algorithms for locating histoneoccupied
as well as acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation
positions in DNA sequences has also been well reported [], [],
[], [], []. Some of these tools have also been applied to ChIPon-
chip and ChIP-seq datasets. An example is the use of HMMs to
infer the states of histone modification changes at each genomic
position based on ChIP fragment counts []. The use of wavelet
analysis combined with HMMs for the discovery of activating and
repressive histone modifications using selected ChIP-on-chip datasets
from the ENCODE project was also reported []. These algorithms
allow the screening of histone marks in large sets of protein sequences,
such as those encoded by the complete genomes of higher complexity
organisms. In recent years, a number of structure-based techniques,
including quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis
[], [], homology modeling [] and molecular docking
techniques [], for the design of epigenetic inhibitors were also
described. Dynamic activities over the past two years have seen the
development of at least five computational methods for the functional
annotation of epigenetic factors [], []. These tools are
particularly useful for the understanding of epigenetic events, both
within specific cell types and in an evolutionary context.

Cancer informatics
Cancer progression is a form of somatic evolution in which certain
mutations provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. It is
now known that DNA methylation patterns in cancers generally
display more variation compared with that of normal tissues [].
Several studies have shown that aberrant methylation occurs in a
tumor type-specific manner []. A number of cancer epigenetic
projects are currently underway to identify novel methylation patterns
that correlate with progression to malignancy. An example is the
CancerDip Consortium, a research initiative funded by the 7th
Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development
of the European Commission (FP7), which employs the use of Methyl-
DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) assays for identifying
methylation patterns in different tumor types and the epigenetic
machinery involved in establishing these abnormal patterns [].
Genome-wide analysis of MeDIP data from colon (Caco-2) and
prostate (PC3) cancer as well as several tumor cell lines have shown
that tumor-specific methylated genes belong to distinct functional
categories, possess common sequence motifs in their promoters and
occur in clusters on chromosomes []. Abnormal DNA methylation
within CpG islands is among the most frequent form of alterations in
cancers. Experiments have now shown that entire CpG islands may
become aberrantly methylated in cancer [], and is mechanistically
linked to histone methylation []. Bock and coworkers []have
performed a detailed analysis of inter-individual stability and
variations of DNA methylation profiles among healthy individuals
using linear regression models and the EpiGRAPH web service
(http://epigraph.mpi-inf.mpg.de/WebGRAPH/). This work showed
that CpG islands may act collectively as emergent and bistable
epigenetic switches for maintaining a CpG-island-wide ’on‘ or ’off‘
state. An example for tumor class prediction in human cancers was
reported by Olek and colleagues [], in which SVMs were trained to
recognize the difference between T and B cell leukaemias and CD19+
B cells and CD4+ T cells obtained from healthy donors using a set of
selected CpG sites. Other computational models for classifying cancer
subtypes based on epigenetic marks were also reported. Specific
examples include the use of SVMs for discriminating between acute
lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia [], as well as
the use of Manhattan distance and average linkage algorithms for
hierarchical cluster analysis of human colorectal tumors [].

Stem cell informatics
Stem cells are unspecialized cells that can either renew themselves
through mitotic cell division or undergo differentiation into more
specialized cells []. Two classes of mammalian stem cells are
available:
embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are blastocyst-derived, pluripotent cells that can differentiate into all cell types except the
extra-embryonic tissue [], [], and 


 adult stem cells, which act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells and
regenerating damaged tissues [].

 Recent studies have shown that
DNA methyltransferases [] and Polycomb/Trithorax group
response elements (PRE/TRE) [], []possess epigenetic
signatures that are important for the differentiation of both human ES
cells and germ line stem cells. Of particular interest is the revelation
that stem cells are the target cells for cancer, and epigenetic changes
may occur long before they are distinguishable as tumor cells [].
By unraveling the nature of epigenetic modifications, it is expected
that this will lead to improved culture and differentiation technologies,
as well as next-generation drugs that can directly manipulate stem
cells in patients.

Bioinformatic analysis of epigenetic marks in stem cells is at its
formative stages. Analyses of up- and down-regulated gene clusters
provide valuable information on the effect of exogenous control on ES
cell state in human. Stanford and colleagues [] have recently
performed temporal expression microarray analyses of ES cells after
the initiation of commitment and integrated these data with known
genome-wide transcription factor binding. This work revealed a
repressive model of ES cell maintenance, and helped define the
regulatory balance that is needed for maintaining ES cell state.
Ringrose and coworkers [] performed an analysis of PRE/TREs in
the Drosophila melanogaster genome and defined the sequence
criteria that distinguish PRE/TREs from non- PRE/TREs. Using a
series of weighted motifs, the team identified 167 candidate PRE/TRE
sequences, which map to genes involved in development and cell
proliferation. Position-specific matrices for predicting cis-regulatory
elements were also reported, and used for studying PRE/TREs in
Drosophila melanogaster [].

Conclusion
Realizing the full benefits of the informatics revolution will require
significant advances in the efficiency of which new data is discovered,
processed, interpreted and made accessible to researchers. With the
huge amount of epigenetic-related experimental data generated by
high throughput methodologies, the future will witness a shift towards
the computational epigenetics paradigm (). With the paradigm
shift, one crucial issue lies in effective data annotation and
management. Currently, a centralized repository for epigenetic-related
data is still lacking. Resources like such will greatly facilitate
computational studies on epigenetics. Another challenge in the field of
computational epigenetics lies in the efficient processing of
experimental data, which includes normalization and interpretation of
data across various experiments from different research groups.

To date, computational algorithms that model different aspects of
epigenetic modifications [–] and 
disease [–] have been
described. On the other hand, cellular automata have also been
proposed for exploring a variety of epigenetic modifications [].
With the explosion in the number, variety and sophistication of
resources and analysis tools, the challenge lies in integrating the
strengths and not the weaknesses of each approach. The next few years
will see increased interest in the use of cluster computing, central
(cloud) computing and distributed systems for large-scale epigenetic
data analysis and screening. Computing grid technologies harnessing
the resources of multiple computers in a network have been developed
rapidly to solve high-throughput scientific research problem []. On
the other hand, cloud computing technologies, which offers scalable
resources on demand, have emerged in recent years to complement the
rate of data output and drive the rate of data analysis and knowledge
discovery []. The different bioinformatic and mathematical
modeling approaches, in combination with advances in computational
infrastructures, clearly could lead to improved understanding of
epigenetic modifications at multiple levels of complexity, from the
sub-cellular molecular level, to the cellular and systems level, and beyond. More importantly, research efforts in computational analysis,
identification and classification of variations in epigenetic
modifications contribute to further understanding of epigeneticassociated
diseases and consequently, the design of relevant
diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic tools. One exciting
possibility, based on the highly combinatorial nature of epigenetics, is
the cataloguing of individuals‘ genome and epigenome and the
development of personalized or more specific drugs with lower
toxicity and less side effects, paving the way for personalized
medicine and a new era of “personal”-omics [].
