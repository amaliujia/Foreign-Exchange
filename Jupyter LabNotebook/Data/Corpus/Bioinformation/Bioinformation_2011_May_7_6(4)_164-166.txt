Background
Molecular docking, used in structure-based virtual screening (SBVS)
campaigns, is considered a powerful tool in drug discovery 
[–]. Some drugs
on the market, e.g., Dorzolamide® (Merck &amp; Co) 
[], Saquinavir® (Hoffmann-
La Roche) [], Indinavir® 
(Merck &amp; Co.) [], 
Ritonavir® (Abbott Laboratories) [] 
and Nelfinavir® (Agouron Pharmaceuticals) 
[], were discovered or
designed using this approach []. Some limitations of the molecular docking
method have been identified and have led to fruitful discussions 
[,
]. The
primary challenge was to improve the quality of the scoring functions, which
determines the ranking of the compounds in SBVS [,
].. Most of the available
scoring functions were developed as all-purpose models, which can presumably
be applied in all protein-ligand complexes. However, despite the considerable
progress in the development of scoring functions, they are still far from being
universally accurate [,
]. Therefore, using prior knowledge and targeted
scoring functions in the construction of the SBVS protocols can be a useful
solution []. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme that plays an important
role in inflammatory processes []. The dataset, which was compiled from the
ZINC database (http://zinc.docking.org/) to retrospectively validate and
compare SBVS protocols to find COX-2 inhibitors, is publicly available in the
directory of useful decoys (http://dud.docking.org/r2/cox2.tar.gz). The enzyme
has been considered a challenging target for SBVS campaigns [,
].. For the
first SBVS campaign, a dataset from the directory of useful decoys (DUD) was
used to find COX-2 inhibitors by employing the DOCK 3.5.54 docking
software. The results showed a maximum enrichment factor (EFmax) value and
an enrichment factor value at 20% of the database (EF20) of 29.1 and 3.3,
respectively [], 
which were considered as good results []. We had previously
described the applicability of the Protein-Ligand ANT System (PLANTS)
docking software to reproduce the crystal structure interaction of 1-
phenylsulfonamide-3-trifluoromethyl-5-parabromophenyl-pyrazole (1) with
COX-2 (pdb code: 6COX; http://dx.doi.org/10.2210/ pdb6cox/pdb) 
[,
].. In
this article, we present the retrospective validation of a developed protocol to
perform as a screening tool for the discovery of COX-2 inhibitors using SBVS
campaigns. Additionally, the construction of a modified protocol is displayed
by inserting an additional constraint to the hydrogen bond formed by ligands to
ARG513 of the COX-2 since previously published studies indicate that this
particular interaction is important for COX-2 inhibitors 
[,
].. Although the
default protocol could reproduce the structural interactions from the crystal
structure [], 
the results showed that the protocol showed poor results as an
SBVS campaign to discover COX-2 inhibitors. Conversely, the modified
protocol resulted in excellent EFmax and EF20 values 
[].

Methodology
The COX-2 ligands and decoys (426 known inhibitors in 13289 decoys) were
obtained from the DUD website (http://dud.docking.org/r2/) 
[]. The target
enzyme, virtual COX-2 (protein.mol2), and the PLANTS configuration file
(plantsconfig) were obtained from a previous study []. The PLANTS
docking software v1.1 was used as the SBVS docking tool 
(http://www.tcd.unikonstanz.de/research/plants.php). 
The receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
curves were calculated using R statistical computing software version 2.11.1
(http://www.r-project.org/). 
All computational simulations were performed on
an HP-xw6600 workstation with Intel Xeon E5420/2.5 GHz Quadcores as the
processors, 8 GB of RAM and a Linux version 2.6.26-2-amd64 (Debian 2.6.26-
26lenny1) as the operating system. The compounds were virtually screened
using the PLANTS docking software by employing a previously developed
virtual COX-2 as the target []. Two independent simulations were
performed: (i) original protocol (using previously described config file
(plantsconfig)) [] and (ii) modified protocol (original protocol with a
constraint to atom number 7808 (Hydrogen bond to ARG513;
mod_plantsconfig). The compounds were then ranked based on their scores,
and ROC curves were calculated and generated. The quality of the screening
procedures was judged using criteria introduced by Huang et al. 
[]. The paired
t-test of the true positive rate values was performed to analyze the importance
of hydrogen bonding at ARG513, which would aid in the discovery of COX-2
inhibitors. The configuration files used in these screenings are available in
.

Results and Discussion
The ROC curves are presented in . The figure shows that the
modified protocol provided better results compared to the results from the
default protocol. The EFmax and EF20 values of the SBVS using the default
protocol were 1.8 and 1.5, respectively. However, the modified protocol
showed EFmax and EF20 of 32.2 and 3.7, respectively. Referring to standards
determined by Huang et al. [], the quality of the SBVS default protocol has
been considered poor, while the modified protocol can be considered very
good. Moreover, the paired t-test of true positive values provided a significance 
value of less than 0.05. This showed that the modified protocol at a 95% level
of confidence differed significantly compared to the default method for the
screening COX-2 inhibitors. This data supports previous hypotheses that the
hydrogen bond formation between ligands and ARG513 is important for COX-
2 inhibition [,
].
This also confirmed that inputting prior knowledge into
the protocol could increase the quality of the SBVS 
[]. Furthermore, this result
provided a valid protocol that could be used to perform virtual screening to
design and discover COX-2 inhibitors. The computational time needed to
perform each retrospective validation is about 80 hours. It is not efficient to
perform similar validation to avoid calculation instability caused by differences
in the computer systems used in the screening. Therefore, we suggest selecting
a single compound as the reference compound. The compound can be selected
by calculating the Matthews correlation coefficient (φ) values 
(). The
reference compound was the compound with the highest φ value, which
indicated the best discrimination ability compared to other known inhibitors.
The modified protocol showed that the selected reference compound was
ZINC03814717 (shown as an inset in ), with an enrichment factor
value of 3.7 (EF21.01). The accuracy and sensitivity of the SBVS for EF21.01 were
80.7% and 78.4%, respectively. Compound ZINC03814717 has been reported
as a COX-2 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 290 nM or pIC50 of 6.54 
[,.
 shows the docking pose of ZINC03814717, using the modified
protocol, in the COX-2 binding pocket together with the crystal structure of
compound 1. Similar to the pose of compound 1 (shown as an inset in 
), 
the sulfonamide moiety formed a hydrogen bond to ARG513. The
sulfonamide moiety showed an additional hydrogen bond at the backbone of
SER353. Remarkably, the nitro group of ZINC03814717 showed a hydrogen
bond to SER530, which is known as a binding anchor of COX-2 ligands 
[].
This interaction was not observed in the binding pose of compound 1 to COX-2
[,
].
This indicated that there were other important interactions that could
be used to increase the quality of the SBVS. Further experiments were
suggested to optimize the SBVS by varying the constraint weight and the
binding residues.

Conclusion
A retrospective SBVS validation using the DUD dataset for COX-2 inhibitors
showed that, although the docking protocol, i.e., the default setting on the
PLANTS docking software, was able to accurately reproduce the crystal
structure interaction between compound 1 and COX-2 
[], it needed
additional constraints in the protocol to perform better SBVS. This study
confirmed the importance of interactions between COX-2 inhibitors and
ARG513. Using criteria introduced by Huang et al. 
[], the quality of the
SBVS approach increased.
