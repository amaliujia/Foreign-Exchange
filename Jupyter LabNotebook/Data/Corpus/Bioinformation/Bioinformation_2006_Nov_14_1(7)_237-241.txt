Background
Peptides play a pre-eminent role in biological systems. However, as complex 
biological molecules, their physical properties have not received the attention 
that they deserve. In particular, their study by QSAR lags someway behind that 
of organic small molecules. QSAR has, traditionally, focussed on experimentally 
determined partition coefficients as a principal descriptor of lipophilicty or 
hydrophobicity. The partition coefficient is the ratio between the 
concentration of a chemical substance in two phases: typically one aqueous and 
one an organic solvent. Experimental measurement involves dissolving a compound 
within a biphasic system and determining its molar concentration in each 
layer:

P = [drug]organic / [drug]aqueous

The organic solvent used is usually 1-octanol. The partition coefficient can 
range over 12 orders of magnitude, and is usually quoted as a logarithm: logP. 
It is generally assumed that the log P of the neutral species 
is 2-5 log units greater than that of the ionized form, and that this is 
sufficiently large that the partitioning of the charged molecule into the 
organic phase can be neglected.

Despite problems with properly measuring logP values, they represent a 
potentially vital source of descriptors for QSAR studies of peptides. However, 
the experimental measurement of logP values is expensive, time consuming, and 
labour intensive. Accurate methods for the prediction of peptide logP values 
would thus be most useful. During the past three decades, many methods for 
predicting logP have been reported. At present, the most widely accepted method 
is a fragmental or additive approach, where a molecule is dissected into 
fragments (functional groups or atoms) and its logP value is obtained by 
summing the contributions of each fragment. ‘Correction factors’
 are also introduced to rectify the calculated logP value when special 
substructures occur in the molecule.

Fragment-based methods are the most common. In fragment-based methods, a 
complex compound is divided into a series of small, simple fragments, such that 
each atom contained within the compound is present in one, and only one, 
fragment. The logP value for each fragment is known. Additive methods can also 
be based upon adding the logP values of each atom within the compound, rather 
than from a series of fragments. This alleviates the problem of missing 
fragments. An example of an atom based prediction method is XLOGP developed by 
Wang. [,] Other approaches are based upon the 
use of topological indices and quantum mechanics.

There have been various studies carried out on the logP prediction for 
peptides. Maybe the most convincing approach was undertaken by Akamatsu and 
co-workers [], which 
investigate the hydrophobicity for peptides by carefully measuring the 
partition coefficients of a wide variety of peptides. After studying these data 
with linear regression analysis, they obtained different regression models for 
different kinds of peptides, resulting in a good correlation between observed 
and predicted logP values. Various physicochemical parameters 
are used in their models, including structural effects, β-turn 
formation corrections, N- and C-terminal effects, etc. This work and subsequent 
work by Akamatsu's group was incorporated into a logP prediction 
program known as PlogP. [
] Here, a training set included 219 blocked and unblocked peptides, 
varying between 2 and 5 amino acids in length. The model was further tested 
with 10 more peptides.

Various studies have compared the performance of different logP prediction 
programs. However, no study focussing on peptides has been reported. In this 
paper we look at prediction of logP values for peptides. It obviously focuses 
on a different aspect of this prediction problem compared to the prediction of 
properties of small molecules, which is the more typical focus for workers in 
the field. Our main motivation is to better understand basic physico-chemical 
properties in the design of peptide vaccines. Here we take a data-set of 
experimentallydetermined peptide logPs and use this to compare eight publicly 
and commercially available programs, based on 7 fragment and 1 whole-molecule 
based methods for logP prediction.

Methodology
Data-set
A set of peptides with known experimental logP values was compiled from the 
primary literature, through exhaustive, semimanual searching of a variety of 
different databases: PubMed [
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi] , Web of Science 
[
wos.mimas.ac.uk], Medline [medline.cos.com], and ScienceDirect 
(
http://www.sciencedirect.com/). Both keyword and author searches, as 
well as retrospective searching, and citation matching of key authors, 
particularly those describing the development of an assay system, were used to 
identify papers detailing quantitative experimentally-derived values. The 
availability of measured LogP values for peptides was limited. The dataset 
consisted of 340 peptides, varying from 2 to 16 amino acids in length, and 
included 141 blocked peptides, 158 unblocked peptides, and 41 cyclic 
peptides.

Software Analysed
Seven fragment-based (XLogP [
,], LogKow [www.syrres.com], 
PLogP [], ACDLogP 
[
www.acdlabs.com], ALogP [www.vcclab.org], IALogP [www.logp.com] and 
MLogP [
www.tripos.com]) and one whole molecule approaches (QikProp 
[
www.schrodinger.com]) were studied in our analysis. These were 
downloaded or accessed on-line during June-August 2003. Methods implemented 
pre-defined general models for logP calculation, a peptide specific logP model, 
and a type of inhouse trainable model for peptide logP prediction. We used 
software either via internet servers or as versions installed locally. As the 
input requirements of each program were different, various representations of 
the structures were created: amino acid sequences for use with PlogP; SMILES 
strings [] for ALogP, 
LogKow and IAlogP; 2D SYBYL ‘mol2’ files for XLOGP [www.tripos.com]; 3D 
structures for QikProp and MlogP. 3D Structures were generated using Corina.

Results and Discussion
Peptides within the dataset varied widely, with large ranges of physical 
size and formal charge. There appeared to be no statistically significant 
relationship between the length of peptide and their respective logP values.

experimental versus predicted logP. A list of the 379 peptide structures 
comprising the dataset, together with results from the various methods, is 
recorded in the online supplementary material (URL:

.Overall, it was the fragment based method ALogP that performed the best (r
2 = 0.819). It predicted values for blocked peptides with very high 
accuracy (r2 = 0.822). The whole molecule method, QikProp, seems 
comparable to the fragment-based methods and shows a similar overall 
performance to PLOGP, IALogP and XLogP. QikProp is a 3D structure based method. 
Between -3 and 1 log units, predicted logP is well correlated with experiment. 
For peptides with experimental values of greater than 4 log units, 
QikProp's accuracy decreases and it predicts unblocked peptides poorly 
(r2 = 0.560). PLOGP is parameterised for peptides, has been trained 
on some of the dataset, and can not predict values for cyclic or chemically 
modified peptides. Thus the program was tested with only 44 peptides (17 
blocked and 27 unblocked). Statistically the results from both types of 
peptides were poorly correlated, r2 = 0.482. Unblocked peptides are 
predicted poorly (r2 = 0.009) but blocked peptides (r2 = 
0.800) are very well predicted. PLOGP was trained on peptides with five or 
fewer amino acids, and predictions of shorter peptides are slightly better. For 
XlogP, results for the whole data set were poor (r2 = 0.428), while 
results for the blocked and cyclic peptides (r2 = 0.665, 0.665 
respectively) were reasonable; the unblocked peptides (r2 = 0.158), 
however, showed a much weaker correlation. IALogP produces the worst 
predictions for the cyclic peptides (r2 = 0.399). The program seems 
best at predicting values in the range -3 to 2 log units, although it 
over-predicted higher valued peptides. This group of four programs all show 
equal performance and are ranked second to ALogP, although the score for ALogP 
is somewhat better. Fragment based methods are, however, easier to use than 
QikProp, do not require training, and do not require any prior knowledge apart 
from the peptide structures. For LogKow, statistics for the whole dataset are 
poor (r2 = 0.277). Unblocked and blocked peptides were predicted 
unsuccessfully (r2 = 0.063 and r2 = 0.389), yet predicted 
cyclic peptide values very well (r2 = 0.970). For ACDLogP, blocked 
peptides are predicted with reasonable accuracy (r2 = 0.587) albeit 
predicting slightly higher than the experimental logP values. The results of 
the cyclic peptide (r2 = 0.462) are particularly interesting, 
showing a split into two distinct groups: one under-predicted, the other 
over-predicted. The least effective program in general was MLogP. The overall 
results were poor (r2 = 0.090). MLogP shows the poorest correlation 
for blocked and unblocked peptides, r2 = 0.060 and 0.170 
respectively, although predictions are better for the cyclic peptides (r
2 = 0.661).

We have also calculated the percentage of predictions within +/-0.5 and 
between +/-0.5 and 1.0 log unit respectively of the experimental value. See 
. The best accuracy within +/-0.5 
log units is the IALogP method (47%). This is followed by PLogP 
(39%), QikProp (32%), XLogP (30%), ALogP (27%), 
LogKow (21%), MLogP (13%) and ACDLogP (8%). The best 
accuracy from between +/-0.5 and 1.0 log units is the ALogP method (35%)
. This is followed by QikProp (32%), PLogP (30%), ACDLogLogP 
(24%), IALogP (21%), MLogP (18%), XLogP and LogKow 
(both at 14%).

Comparing blocked, unblocked and cyclic peptides, we see that blocked 
peptides performed well and unblocked peptides performed worst. Unblocked 
peptides will be zwitterionic. The difficulties with some of these prediction 
methods are due to internal constraints: peptides over a certain length or 
those with bulky termini could not be predicted with certain programs. Far 
fewer cyclic peptides were studied and were usually under-predicted. Certain 
peptides were consistent outliers, such as the poly-lysine peptide and peptide 
352A, a blocked acylated dipeptide. These may result from gross experimental 
error, as accurate values were not encountered for any method.

However, 1-octanol is, in reality, a poor choice of organic phase. It is 
“wet”, since it contains much dissolved water, and does not 
effectively separate hydrophobic from other interactions. Its relevance to 
biological systems is open to question, and many have suggested that measuring 
the partition into other organic phases, such as phospholipids bilayers or 
micelles, may prove a more rewarding avenue for seeking biologically-relevant 
measures of peptide hydrophobicity.

Conclusion
Fragment-based methods are sensitive to the composition but not the sequence 
of peptides, and any future peptide-specific logP studies should account for 
this. Accuracy could be improved using consensus scoring where multiple 
predictions are combined, by averaging or weighting, to generate better 
estimates. However, available methods, though inadequate, particularly for long 
peptides, perform better than might be imagined naively: fragmental methods are 
sufficient. There is little, if any, need to develop new peptide-specific 
treatments of the problem, such as PlogP [], merely a need to improve fragment-based techniques 
and validate their use with peptides.

Our interest in this problem stems from our desire for effective measures of 
hydrophobicity for use in peptide QSAR studies. [] There is a clear paucity of quality data for 
partition coefficients, necessitating an unsatisfying study. The dearth of 
reported experimental studies prevents us from obtaining a dataset of 
sufficient size. The peptides we found are short and have heavily biased 
sequence compositions. Data are both sparse and tendentious in terms of length 
and sequence properties. Longer peptides are of most interest, yet they are 
underrepresented here. The average peptide length was three amino acids, as it 
becomes increasingly difficult to measure logP values experimentally as 
peptides grow longer. As most biologically-important peptides are much longer 
than three amino acids, the data set is likely to compromise successful QSAR 
analysis. Such problems would be resolved with a properly designed training 
set. Our potential ability to combine in vitro and in 
silico analysis would allow us to improve both the scope and power of 
our predictions, in a way impossible using solely literature data.
