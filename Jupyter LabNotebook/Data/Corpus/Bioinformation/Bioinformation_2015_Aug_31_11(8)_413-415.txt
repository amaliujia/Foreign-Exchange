(SBS) are auto-generated by the program ADSBET that makes use of general purpose Adaptive Poison Boltzmann Solver (APBS)
method. While the procedure reports gross energy terms (Kcal Mol-1), report on bond-multiplicity corrected normalized energyterms
(Kcal Mol-1 Bond-1) along with their accessibility (ASA) in monomer, isolated-SBS (ISBS) and networked-SBS (NSBS) format
would be very useful for statistical comparison among SBSs and understanding their location in protein structure. In this end,
ADSBET2 potentially incorporates these features along with additional model for side-chain. Gross and normalized energy-terms
are redirected in monomer, ISBS and NSBS format along with their ASA informations. It works on any number of SBSs for any
number of structure files present in a database. Taken together, ADSBET2 has been suitable for statistical analyses of SBSs
energetics and finds applications in protein engineering and structural bioinformatics.

Background
Salt-bridge, electrostatic interactions between partial charges of
side-chain of acidic and basic residues, plays crucial role in
stability and packing of protein. It is more so for proteins
adapted in extreme environments [1]. Use of general purpose
integrators of Poison Boltzmann Equation such as open-source
Adaptive Poison Boltzmann Solver (APBS) [2] is the only
means over experimental pKa or double-mutational cycle
methods [3] to compute overall components (i.e. bridge-energy:
ΔΔGbrd, background-energy: ΔΔGprot , desolvation-energy:
ΔΔGdsolv) and net-energy (ΔΔGnet) terms of SBS 
[4,
5]. However,
relative to other applications of the solver, computation of
energy-terms of SBS is highly labor intensive that includes
determination of protein-specific a] and residue specific salt
bridges or ion-pairs [6,
7], b] grid-points, c] grid center and d]
hydrophobic-isosteres-mediated mutation-files (five per SBS)
from original protein-charge-radius (PQR) file [8] prior
computation. Further in post-computation scenario, great deals
of manual involvement are also necessary to obtain i] energyterms
from reaction field energies and relevant choice of partial
atomic charges [9] and ii] side-chains-specific accessibility of
SBS. While ADSBET [10] performs all these pre and post-run
computations, it has few short-comings. Firstly it does not
report bond multiplicity corrected normalized energy-terms
(Energy Bond-1 SBS-1) in monomer, ISBS and NSBS
format which would be necessary for comparison among SBSs
present in a database. While, for example, comparable net
energy-terms for ISBS (in S1 and S2 of Figure 1: FII) are E1 and
E2/2 and that for NSBS (in N1 and N2 of Figure 1: FII) are
(E3+E4) and (E5/2+E6/2) respectively, ADSBET only reports E1,
E2, E3, E4, E5 and E6 in monomer format. Secondly it does not
inform side-chain model-specific accessibility [10] which would
be crucial for understanding surface and core location of SBS 
[5,
6] (Figure 1: ρ). Finally as far as models for side-chains of
interacting partner of SBS are concerned, only a less popular
model (i.e. MDL-1) is available in ADSBET [10] 
(Figure 1). In
this context, ADSBET2 potentially includes all these features
along with popular additional model of side chain (i.e. MDL-2).
When opted, it reports side-chain ASA by the use of either of
three alternative methods.

Method of computation of ΔΔGbrd, ΔΔGprot, ΔΔGdsolv and ΔΔGnet
remains similar as earlier [10]. Detailed methods also precede
analytical result of each item of outputs. Normalized energyterms
of each monomeric SBS are obtained by dividing these
terms by their bond-multiplicity (Figure 1: FII, S2, and N2).
When opted, accessibility (hence surface and core location) of
SBS is computed. Overall and normalized energy-terms for
NSBS are obtained by summing energy-terms of all monomeric
cases having either a common acidic (A-NSBS: FII N1) or basic
(B-NSBS: FII N2) partner in a SBS (thus forming dimer, trimer
etc). Apart from MDL-1 of ADSBET [10], ADSBET2 utilizes
additional most-popular model for side chains i.e. MDL-2
(Figure 1: FI). Operational details of the program includes
following sequence of events: a] make list of x-ray files in PDB
format (Figure 1: FIII), b] uptake user׳s parameters from
command line, c] extract atomic SBS and then convert them
into residue-specific SBS, d] select model of side-chain, e] select
accessibility mode and method, f] Generate force-field
dependent PQR-file and protein-specific APBS-parameters
(such as dime, gcent, grid-points, ionic-strength and pH), g]
generate 5 relevant mutated-POR-files per SBS, h] prepare
input-file for APBS using user, default, generated parameters
and mutated PQRs, i] run APBS, j] redirect output and k] repeat
the process for other SBSs and PDBs.

Program input
Poison Boltzmann Equation solvers (such as APBS) require
multi-parameters input for generation of reaction field energy
[2]. Thus, apart from PDB-files in the working directory users
need to input parameters (Figure 1: FIII: User Input) such as
model for side-chain (F1), ASA method, grid-spacing, pH,
mobile ion concentration (in Molar), dielectric constant of
protein, salt-bridge or ion-pair distance and force-field. Protein
specific parameters (such as dime, gcent and grid-points) are
auto-generated by the program and other parameters are used
as default (Figure 1: FIII: Default pars) if not mentioned
otherwise.

Program output
Details of SBS-energetics and accessibility for any number of
SBS in any number of PDBs are redirected into two different
named-outputs. Unlike ADSBET [10], ADSBET2 redirects most
relevant model-based additional output (Figure 1: FIII: Green
color parts) on overall and normalized energetics in monomer,
ISBS and NSBS format along with their core and surface
location informations (Figure 2).

Caveats and future development
The program which is interpreted by AWK programming
language is tested to run in the OS: CYGWIN (32 bit). We
further are working to develop GUI-based version of the
program.

Conclusion
ADSBET2, interpreted by AWK programming language,
produces model-based overall and normalized SBS-energetics
in monomer, ISBS and NSBS formats along with their
accessibility information for any member of X-ray structure
files with any number of SBSs in them. These results are useful
for statistical comparison of SBS-energetics of candidate saltbridges
or ion-pairs present in a database.

Figure 1 Model-based side-chains (FI), different SBS (FII) and flow-chart (FIII) for ADSBET2. MDL-1 and MDL-2 are used in
model-1 and model-2 respectively. S1 (energy E1) and N1 (energy E3 and E4) are single-bonded isolated and networked SBS. S2
(energy E2) and N2 (energy E5 and E6) are multiple-bonded isolated and networked SBS. P shows core and surface location of SBS.
In FIII, N-AS and U-As are acidic side-chains in folded and unfolded state of protein respectively. Additional features in ADSBET2
over its earlier version are shown in green color.

Figure 2 Total and normalized energy terms along with named
outputs. Bond-multiplicity, Av DIST and ASA are also
reported. ddGprot-I [4] and ddGprot-II 
[5] (hence ddGnet-I and
ddGnet-II respectively) are background energies of model
based side chains of non-SBS residues.
