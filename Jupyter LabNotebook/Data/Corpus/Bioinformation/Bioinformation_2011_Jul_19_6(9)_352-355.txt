Background
Glycosylation is the most common type of post-translational modification
(PTM) in proteomes and thought to be one factor contributing in enhancing the
diversity of proteomes []. 
There are five main types of glycosylation: Olinked,
N-linked, C-linked, P-linked and G-linked []. N-linked and O-linked
glycosylation are the most abundant types of glycosylation 
[]. O-linked
glycosylation is characterized by the attachment of carbohydrate units to the
hydroxyl (OH) group of Serine (S), Threonine (T), Tyrosine (Y),
Hydroxyproline, or Hydroxylysine side chains []. In contrast, N-linked
glycosylation generally means the attachment of carbohydrate units to the
nitrogen group in Asp-Xaa-Ser/Thr (N-X-S/T) motif, where Xaa is any amino
acid except for Proline []. Species of three domains of life possess unique
biological characteristics that provides basis for discrimination among them,
but some of the biological characteristics are common in them as well 
[]. One
of the common biological function is glycosylation which is known to help
prokaryotes invade host cells and induce pathogenecity 
[]. Glycosylation is a
ubiquitous form of PTMs necessary for most of cellular organisms 
[]. It is also
know to affect the stability of proteins and some proteins need to be
glycosylated in order to fold properly []. In the absence of glycosylation,
immature proteins do not fold properly hence shows that it is an essential cotranslational
event for correct folding of proteins []. Furthermore, cells of
immune system also employ glycosylation strategies for cell adhesion purposes
[]. 
Problems with glycosylation mechanism can result in serious disorders
including colon cancer and brain diseases. Thus understanding glycosylation is
central to our understanding []. In case of N-linked glycosylation, the N of
N-X-S/T motif serves as the acceptor site for the addition of glycan chains. Xaa
position can have any amino acid, but Proline, but it has also been shown that
the presence of negatively charged residues at Xaa result in partial
glycosylation and positively charged residues are favorable 
[]. It is also an
experimental fact that due to several structural constraints only 66% of the
NXS/T motifs are glycosylated []. Enzyme responsible for charging the
proteins with sugar groups is generally known as oligosaccharyltransferase
(OST) in eukaryotes. Homologs of OST in bacteria are known as PglB whereas
Archaeal enzymes are referred to as AglB. The C-terminal of these enzymes
has a signature motif of 5 residues with a sequence of Trp-Trp-Asp-[Tyr-Asn-
Phe-Trp]-Gly (WWD[YNFW]G) that is of central importance for the activity
of OSTs. Any mutation in this motif results in deactivation of OSTs and
consequently loss of glycosylation activity []. Other important motifs that
have been identified in OSTs include Met-Xaa-Xaa-Ile/Val/Met(MxxI/V/M)
and Asp-Xaa-Xaa-Lys (Dxxk) motifs []. MxxI motif is found to be involved
in enhancing the functional activity of OSTs. DK motif in eukaryotes,
especially yeast, revealed certain importance in the survival of the organism as
it involves the metal ion binding to the OSTs []. In 1999, Rolf Apweiler
analyzed protein sequence data and proposed that approximately half the
proteins in a proteome are glycoproteins []. Presence of such a high number
of potential glycoproteins is intriguing and points towards the importance of
glycosylation for cells. In this study, we used programming implementations in
Python to quantify the distribution of glycoproteins in the proteomes of all
cellular organisms. We also explored the number of possible OST enzymes
present in proteomes by searching for its signature motifs in target proteins.
Our results support the findings Apweiler made 12 years ago and show that a
significant proportion of all the cellular proteomes is devoted for the allimportant
function of glycosylation. Eukaryotes carry the most number of
potential glycoproteins followed by Bacteria and Archaea. This tendency
should not surprise us given the nature of rich protein repertoires of eukaryotes.
The current study, based on the calculation of total number of glycoproteins,
would be helpful in understanding the functional aspects of proteomes that
have remained conserved in all the three domains of life and reveals exciting
patterns in proteomes.

Methodology
Proteome Data Collection
The data of genome-encoded proteins till 13th July, 2010 was directly
downloaded from the ExPASy databases namely Swiss-Prot (518415 total
protein entries), TrEMBL (11397958), Eukaryotes (522631), Archaea (183509)
and Bacteria (3297512).

A Computational Program: Motif Percentage Calculations
In order to calculate statistics related to the characterization of glycoproteins
and OSTs in proteomes a Python script was developed that first combines all
the proteomes belonging to a superkingdom into a single file. For instance, the
proteome data of all eukaryotes is represented by separate FASTA files and the
first step in the execution of our script is to pool all the proteomes together and
generate separate files for Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. This step is not
necessary when handling global statistics for Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL
databases. Next step is to scan all the proteins for the presence of motifs linked
to N-glycosylation. Specifically, the output reports the following statistics: total
occurrences of N-X-S/T, MxxI, DxxK, and WWD[YNFW]G motifs; the
number of proteins that are hit with these motif; number of times NXS/T,
MxxI, DxxK and WWD[YNFW]G motif are present per protein; and, cooccurrences
of pairs of motifs i.e. NXS/T + MI + WWD[YNFW]G, NXS/T +
WWD[YNFW]G + DK, and NXS/T + WWD[YNFW]G + MI + DK motifs.

Results and Discussion
Results compiled on 13/07/2010 suggest that 7126620 out of 11397958 protein
entries in TrEMBL (62.5%), 323893 out of 518415 in Swiss-Prot (62.47%),
99113 out of 183509 in Archaea (54%), 1882496 out of 3297512 in bacteria
(57%) and 398821 out of 522631 proteins in eukaryotes (76%) possess N-XS/
T motif i.e. these can potentially be glycoproteins (). Eukaryotes
appear to have the highest number of potential glycoproteins followed by
Bacteria and then Archaea. In order to find whether the observed differences
between the three superkingdoms (Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya) are
statistically significant or not we conducted Analysis of Variance for
Completely Randomized Design (ANOVA CRD) on a sample of 1,000
proteins each from three domains of life. The selected sample was parsed using
Python and counts for number of times N-X-S/T motif is present per protein
was calculated. The selected sample of 1,000 proteins each from the three
superkingdoms had all their lengths in range of 1000-1500 amino acids. The
computed statistics from ANOVA CRD are shown in (Table 1 see
) The computed p-value for the differences between
the three super kingdoms at 95% confidence interval using R was &lt;2.2e-16
depicting that the results are significant at P&lt;0.0002. Therefore, null hypothesis
(means of count of NXS/T motif per protein for all superkingdoms are equal) is
rejected. Tukey's Honesty Significant Differences (HSD) test was used to
detect the pair-wise differences between all of the three superkingdoms of
sample data. It appears that all the three kingdoms differ significantly to each
other at 95% confidence intervals as shown in . The interval is not
spanning zero hence implies that superkingdoms differ significantly. Variance
between the eukaryotes and bacteria pair is more than the rest of the two. MI
motif follows the similar pattern i.e. eukaryotes represents the higher number.
However, the numbers for DK motif deviate from the general pattern a little.
Eukaryotes have still the highest percentage for DK motifs (60.89%), followed
by Archaea (50.88%) and then Bacteria (47.33%) as shown in (Table 2 see
) Global analysis of Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL
revealed that nearly 50.88% of the proteins carry DK motif for Swiss-Prot
whereas 45.25% of proteins are tagged with DK motif in TrEMBL 
().  
reports the average number of times a motif is present in an
individual protein. The mean values are reported for all the 4 motifs. On
average more than one site of NXS/T sequon was recorded in each of the
potential acceptor protein in all three domains. According to our results
tendency of eukaryotes to produce glycans is higher, ~4, than the rest of the
other two domains of life i.e., archaea and bacteria, 2.56 and 2.23 respectively.
However, one to two sites of MxxI and DxxK motifs could be present per
protein, eukaryotes being the highest one. It can be observed that eukaryotes
possess higher content of glycoproteins. It has also been cleared from the
literature study that highest percentage of glycosylated proteins is present in
eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes []. Hence implying that glycosylation
is being an important mechanism for the healthy survival of eukaryotic
organisms. Furthermore, co-occurrence of the motif pairs
((WWD[YNFW]G+DK), (WWD[YNFW]G+MI) and (MI+DK)) was
calculated in order to find out the total number and percentage of proteins that
can potentially act as OSTs. According to the results, the highest percentages
for the WWD[YNFW]G+DK (0.056%) and WWD[YNFW]G+MI (0.057%)
motif pairs were observed in case of archaea database suggesting that these
proteins can be potential OSTs. Whereas, it was observed that percentage of
DK+MI motif co-occurrence pair was relatively higher than that of the
WWD[YNFW]G+DK and WWDYG+MI pairs in all the five databases,
especially in case of eukaryotes i.e. 40.44% (211381/522631) (Table 3 see
). 
But the proteins possessing MI+DK motif pairs
cannot be declared as OSTs as they lack the catalytic motif WWD[YNFW]G.
Therefore, overall 28-36% of proteins can act as potential OSTs. There is a
chance that these potential OSTs may possess NXS/T sequon i.e. self
glycosylation site as well. Signature motifs in catalytic center help
differentiating such OSTs from those of the glycoproteins. In order to filter out
the number of OSTs, that possess catalytic center motifs and additionally the
self glycosylation site (NXS/T), three different pairs for the co-occurrences of
catalytic center motifs also containing NXS/T motif were made.
WWD[YNFW]G+MI+DK+NXS/T was the first pair whose ratio was
calculated. It was shown that archaeal proteomes have higher percentage i.e.
0.052314 % for co-occurrence of all of these four motifs 
(). Percentage
calculation of DK motif in (Table 2 see ) and the
literature study have shown that it might be one of the components of the
catalytic center of OSTs but MI motif have higher chance of occurrence. So
two sub pairs of the WWD[YNFW]G+MI+DK+NXS/T signature cooccurrence
pair were made. One was WWD[YNFW]G+NXS/T+MI (DK motif
eliminated) and the other was WWD[YNFW]G+NXS/T+DK (MI motif
eliminated) co-occurrence sub pair. Total number and percentage calculation of
both of these sub pairs have shown more or less similar results except in case
of bacteria whose difference was little bit higher than the rest of the four
databases. An interesting observation was made from the computed result that
the percentage occurrence of WWD[YNFW]G+MI as shown in Table 3 (see
) is similar to the percentage of
WWD[YNFW]G+MI+NXS/T co-occurrence pair therefore implying that all of
the potential OSTs with WWD[YNFW]G+MI catalytic signature motifs
patterns also possess self glycosylation site (NXS/T) as shown in (Table 4 see
).

Conclusion
This study highlights the importance of glycosylation for the cellular life. It
appears that potentially half of the proteome is devoted to perform functions
related to glycosylation. Our results highlight the bias in the representation of
glycoproteins in all the proteomes. Eukaryotes carry most number of potential
glycoproteins and greater than 70% of the eukaryotic proteomes are proposed
to be glycosylated, followed by Bacteria and then Archaea. This tendency is
not surprising as eukaryotes have the most advanced and rich protein
repertoires compared to the prokaryotes. Such high representation advocates
for the importance of glycosylation as the crucial most post-translational
modification that is central to cellular life in the form we see it today. In
addition, prokaryotic proteomes are also enriched with potential glycoproteins.
Finally, the strategy based on calculations of co-occurrences of signature
motifs in OSTs is good for fishing out potential OSTs in available proteomes.
