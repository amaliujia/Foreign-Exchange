Background
Diabetic Retinopathy (see ) is the leading cause of 
preventable blindness. Owing to increased number of diabetes cases in the country, there is an 
increased burden on the specialists for screening and treating such patients. Since the course of 
the disease is affected by the existing physiological parameters of the patients, hence there is a 
need to make a prediction to differentiate the high risk cases from the low risk patients so that 
the specialist can prioritize there treatment and hence divert the limited resources to the treatment 
of those who need them more urgently


Following are the physiological factors which have been reported to affect the 
course of Diabetic Retinopathy, []. 

(1) Blood urea levels [], 
(2) Blood hemoglobin level [], 
(3) Hypertension [] [], 
(4) Antihypertensive drugs [], 
(5) Smoking [] [], 
(6) Obesity (Body Mass Index) [], 
(7) Blood sugar levels [] [], 
(8) Blood lipid levels [], 
(9) Lipid lowering therapy,  
(10) Cardiovascular strokes history, yes OR no, 
(11) Chronic inflammation history, yes OR no,
(12) Renal dysfunction-blood creatinine levels, 
(13) Duration of disease [], 
(14) Age [].



Various studies have shown that modification of risk factors (e.g., increased physical activity, 
reduction in weight) or some institution of treatment (e.g., diabetes and antihypertensive medications) 
may improve retinal vascular measures and might lower risks of diabetes, hypertension, and their 
associated complications []. Tight glycemic and 
blood pressure control remains the cornerstone in the primary prevention of DR. Pan- retinal and focal 
retinal laser photocoagulation reduces the risk of visual loss in patients with severe DR and macular 
edema, respectively [].

In this case we have considered 3 factors, namely Blood urea levels, Hypertension, and Smoking. These 
factors have been highly reported to affect the progress of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Methodology
Data Acquisition
Collection of medical data/history of patients like Age, Duration
disease, Hypertension, Antihypertensive drugs, Smoking, Obesity (BMI), Blood sugar levels, Blood 
lipid levels, Lipid lowering therapy, Cardiovascular strokes history y/n, Chronic inflammation 
history, y/n, Renal dysfunction Blood creatinine levels, Blood urea levels, Blood hemoglobin levels 
from an authentic medical institute(A private eye clinic in our case).

Classification of the patients into four stages of disease (categories) like 1 for mild, 2 for 
moderate, 3 for severe, 4 for proliferative (Standard classification by the Ophthalmologists was 
followed)

Data Cleaning, Normalization, category Identification
Data for around 100 patients were taken; All the patients were starting with Grade 1 DR; 
Their physiological parameters were recorded; Their DR grading after 3 years were recorded; DR 
Gradings were followed as per the Specialists evaluation.

Prediction
Probability based approach was taken and probabilities of the selected physiological parameters 
(Raised Blood Urea Levels, Hypertension and Smoking) were calculated at a given time and based on 
that Grade of DR was predicted(after 3 years in this case). Platform used : Windows; 
Technology used : MATLAB 2008b , C++.

Results and Discussion
[]An approach of probability is being used. 
[] 1st matrix consists of the transition 
probability () of going from one 
stage of Diabetic Retinopathy to another to other (calculated from the recorded data). 
[]The probability of having a particular 
physiological parameter is considered e.g. blood urea level which is taken into consideration here 
(Table 2, see): 
So, another matrix consists of Probability P (x i | q i) of having Raised blood urea level 
(x i = true) based on the stage q i on some day I - Probabilities of combinations of the 
different physiological parameters at different Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy were calculated 
(see ). 
[] Probability of all 3 physiological 
parameters coexisting in a given stage of Diabetic Retinopathy was calculated 
(see ). 
[] Then by knowing the observations of the 
patient and his present stage, future stage of the disease can be calculated 
(see ). 
[] Stage having the maximum likelihood 
will be the result. Example: If the observation is blood urea level (p) = yes(1) 
and let say stage (s) is 1. L (s 2 = 1 | s 1 =1, p=1) = P 
(s 2 =1 | s 1 =1) * P (p=1 | s 2 =1); Similarly we 
can calculate likelihood for other 3 stages, whichever is greater will be the result.

If the observation is blood urea level(p)=no(2) and smoking(q)=yes and 
let say stage (s) is 1 then L (s 2 = 1 | s 1 =1, p=2, q= 1) = 
P (s 2 =1 | s 1 =1) * [P (p=2 | s 2 =1) + P (q=1 | s 2 =1)], 
And the process will be same as before. [] 
A Graphical User Interface has been created where the presence or absence of a particular parameter 
can be entered and the probability of the stage of DR after 3 years can be predicted 
(see &amp; ). 
[] 
Results obtained when tested on a known data had an accuracy of 70%.

Conclusion
Diabetic Retinopathy is a leading cause of preventable blindness. Regular screenings and 
timely interventions can go a long way in controlling DR related blindness. Differentiating 
‘ High Risk ’ (Grade3&amp;4) patients from ‘Low Risk ’ 
(Grade1&amp;2) patients can go a long way in reducing time and cost both on the part of 
the Specialist and the patient.

Here a probability based approach to predict the high risk patients depending on their 
associated physiological parameters has been discussed. The prediction had an accuracy 
of 70%. There is however scope to further improve the prediction: 
[]Results can be further improved by increasing 
the size of dataset. []Some more physiological 
parameters can be considered. []Some other approach like 
SVM_HMM or Artificial Neural Network can be applied. []
Time span of the data can be increased (&gt;3 years) to observe a wider range of 
the course of the disease.

Author ' s Contribution
Prediction of the stage of Diabetic Retinopathy of the patient based on the given associated 
physiological parameters, thus differentiating high risk patients from the low risk ones. Hence 
the High risk patients can be kept under a close supervision and the low risk patients can be 
called for less frequent screenings thus prioritizing treatment and also reducing cost and burden 
on the specialists.
