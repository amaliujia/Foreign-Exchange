infection. However, a clinically approved drug is yet not available to treat HPV. The PDZ(PSD−95/Dlg/ZO−1)−binding motif (PBM)
in the E6 protein of HPVs targets the PDZ domain (known to be associated with oncogenesis) for degradation. Therefore, it is of
interest to study PBM–PDZ interaction towards its possible inhibition with a potential inhibitor. Thus, four pharmocophore models
of PBM−PDZ complex were developed. In order to obtain potent small molecules for its inhibition, a commercial compound
database was screened using both these pharmacophore models and molecule docking method. These efforts identified four
potential compounds (1−4) towards its inhibition with the docking scores range -18.2 to -15.0.



   
Background
Human papilloma viruses (HPVs) belong to the papilloma
virus family with over 170 members [1]. High-risk HPVs cause
cancers of vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx, anus, and are also
considered to be the main causes of cervical carcinomas that is
the second major cause of female cancer-related deaths
worldwide [2]. Vaccines were developed and are currently
used to prevent infection of HPVs in adolescent females.
However, these vaccines are only effective against defined
genomic types, which have been previously designed, and
there is no expectation for the effectiveness of the vaccine in
previously infected patients. Therefore, the development of a
molecular drug targeting HPVs is necessary.

Genetically, HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus, which
consists of a genome of approximately 8000 base pairs and at
least six essential early-expressed proteins (E1, E2, E4−E7) and
two essential late-expressed proteins (L1 and L2) [3]. The E6
protein has been found to be expressed in almost all HPVinfected
cancer cells [4], and is thought to be one of the
responsible factors of viral oncogenic effects and malignant
transformation. In particular, in high-risk HPVs, the E6 protein
binds to the tumor suppressor p53 via E6-associated protein
(E6AP), which promotes the degradation of p53 [5]. However,
immortalized epithelial cells are still detected in mutants
without this interaction. Another contributing factor is the
interaction of the PDZ(PSD-95/Dlg/ZO−1)−binding motif
(PBM) with PDZ domains in the E6 protein (Figure 1a) 
[6].
Therefore, E6 PBM–PDZ binding is an attractive antiviral target
for the development of chemical compounds.

In the current study, we created 4 semi-empirical pharmaco
phore models of the E6C (the C−terminal of the E6 protein)−
PDZ interaction, and screened a commercial database of
approximately 4.5 million compounds using a pharmacophorebased
molecular docking method. The results of the current
study will offer guidance for further investigation of lowmolecule−
weight HPV inhibitors.

Methodology
General:
The pharmacophore and docking studies were performed on a
PC running Windows using modules of the Molecular
Operating Environment (MOE) software package.

Retrieval of target proteins:
The X−ray structures of the PDZ domain and E6C fragment
were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB, http://www.pdb.org/) 
using PDB id 2I04.pdb [7]. Only monomer was
used. After removing water molecules and hydrogen atoms,
partial charges were added using the three−dimensional
protonation module. Moreover, energy minimization was
carried out using default parameters.

Creation of empirical pharmacophore models based on the structure and PDZ–E6C fragment interaction:
First, MOE Ligand interaction module was used to calculate the
ligand−receptor interaction. Based on previous reports showing
that the X-S/T-X-V/I/L motif (Figure 1a) is critical and
conserved in high-risk HPVs [8], according to the orientation of
the threonine and valine residues of the E6C fragment in the cocrystal
structure and protein residues, pharmacophore models
with exclusion volumes were created using the Pharmacophore
Query Editor.

Screening of the database based on pharmacophore models and molecular docking:
A commercial database established by Namiki Shoji Co. Ltd.,
which comprises approximately 4.5 million compounds, was
filtered using pharmacophore models. Subsequently, the MOE
DOCK module was used, which contains steps for a
conformation search of ligands, placement, scoring, refinement
by energy minimization under a defined force field, and
rescoring. Because this database is large and therefore the
screening process is time-consuming, a two-step calculation
was performed. First, docking was carried out without energy
minimization calculation to obtain general information on
whether a certain compound has the ability to bind to a specific
site. In this step, the placement algorithm was set to Alpha
Triangle, and the scoring function was set to London dG.
Subsequently, a refined docking step with energy minimization
calculation was carried out using only the top 30 poses of each
molecule, under the force field MMFF94x. The same score
function and other parameters were used as in the first step.
The site was defined as the space of the ligand molecule (E6C)
using the Site Finder module in both steps of docking. To
confirm the parameters, so-called re-docking trials were carried
on 2I04.pdb and 2 other similar structures (2I0L.pdb, 2I0I.pdb);
2I04.pdb showed a root mean square deviation (RMSD) as low
as 0.52, suggesting sufficient repeatability (data not shown).

Results &amp; Discussion
Generation of the empirical pharmacophore model:
Before creating pharmacophores, the interaction between PDZ
and the E6C fragment within 2I04.pdb was checked using MOE
Ligand interaction module (Figure 1b). We highlighted these
important interactions and created pharmacophores adjacent to
the interacting atoms/residues of the E6C fragment. For the
valine residue, two pharmacophores at either the carbon atom
of the terminal methyl group or only one large pharmacophore
can be considered; therefore, a total of 6 or 7 pharmacophores
were created. In addition, to exclude compounds with region(s)
overlapping receptor atoms, 37 exclusion volumes were added
(represented as yellow balls in Figure 2). Since it is difficult to
meet all of the pharmacophores and exclusion volumes,
selection and combination of these features were needed.
Because valine occupied a cavity formed on the interacting
surface of PDZ, whose constituent residues are conserved or
substituted only by the hydrophobic leucine or isoleucine
residue in high-risk HPVs, the hydrophobic interaction was
thought to be important. The pharmacophore(s) shown in black
are those defined as essential feature(s) in Models 1 and 2
(Figure 2). Moreover, because of the size of the cavity, the
carboxyl group of the valine residue can also be considered
important. Models 3 and 4 included the pharmacophores of the
carboxyl groups as essential (Figure 2).

Pharmacophore search:
Using the 4 pharmacophore models, the NAMIKI database was
searched, and the results are shown in Table 1 (see
supplementary material). The number of features indicates the
minimum number of pharmacophores that the compound׳s
conformation matches with. The number of compounds
obtained from the pharmacophore search based on Models 3
and 4 was lower than that based on Models 1 and 2. This may
be simply due to the fact that the number of pharmacophores
increased. In general, compared to the compounds obtained
from Model 2, those obtained from Model 1 were more planar
(data not shown). This is likely due to the placement of the
valine pharmacophores.

Next, we evaluated the similarity of the compounds obtained
from Model 1 with those obtained from Model 2. SMILES files
of all compounds obtained from Model 1 satisfying at least 4
features (including the essential features) and those obtained
from model 2 satisfying at least 5 features (including the
essential features) were compared. A total of 3147 compounds
were found to be common between the two models. The same
evaluation was carried out between Model 3, satisfying at least
3 features (including the essential features), and Model 4,
satisfying at least 4 features (including the essential features),
and 1550 compounds were found to be common. Although the
structures were quite different, many of the hit compounds
shared a structure of hydrophobic ring(s) oriented toward the
hydrophobic pocket. The compounds that satisfied any of the
following conditions were collected for the subsequent
molecule docking simulation: Model 1 (number of features =
4)/Model 2 (number of features = 5)/Model 3 (number of
features = 3)/Model 4 (number of features = 4). The number of
compounds obtained from Model 1 (number of features =
4)/Model 2 (number of features = 5) was decreased to 12,768
(we refer to these compounds as Group 1), and those obtained
from Model 3 (number of features = 3)/Model 4 (number of
features = 4) was decreased to 4704 (referred to as Group 2).
Before performing the docking studies, the database was
decreased to 1/250, which substantially saved time.

Molecular docking:
Molecule docking was carried out for each molecule, which
provided a score according to the score function London dG.
The lower the score, the more potent the predicted interaction.
When the criterion was set to a score lower than -10, 707
compounds remained in Group 1 and 306 compounds
remained in Group 2.

The top 4 compounds with the lowest docking scores (range -
18.2 to -15.0) among compounds from Model 1 or 2 are shown
in Figure 3. Compounds 1 and 2 were large, exhibiting a large
number of carbon atoms and few hydrophilic groups; both
compounds completely filled up the hydrophobic pocket on the
surface of PDZ. Compounds 3 and 4 interact with 2 residues of
PDZ, Gly463 and Phe464, by hydrophobic bonds (Figure 4).
These 2 residues also interact with the valine of E6C 
(Figure 1b), suggesting potential to inhibit the PBM–PDZ interaction.
On the other hand, although the best compound from Model 3
or Model 4 showed a dock score of -17.4 (data not shown), no
other compounds showed scores as low as compounds 1–4.

Conclusion
In order to reduce cervical carcinomas and other HPVs related
diseases, there is a need to control HPV infection using a
potential drug. However, to date no such drug has been
approved. Therefore, it is of interest to study E6 PBM–PDZ
interaction towards its inhibition using potential lead
compounds. Thus, we report 4 pharmacophore models of E6C
for small molecule screening. The top 4 potential compounds
with features to inhibit this interaction were described.
Furthermore, compared to compounds 1 and 2, compounds 3
and 4 are likely to be more active in biological assays and more
suitable for further consideration, due to the fact that these
compounds interact with residues Gly463 and Phe464 in PDZ.
These two residues also interact with PBM in solution structure.
Information on the specific mode of interaction will provide
insight for the design of anti-HPV drugs.
