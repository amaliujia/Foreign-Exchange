Background
A new H1N1 re-assortant “swine” influenza virus was recently
detected in individuals from the United States who presented
respiratory symptoms, and the same virus was subsequently confirmed
in patients from several countries around the world []. The World
Health Organization (WHO) reported 94,512 cases of influenza A
(H1N1) infection with a pandemic potential, including 429 deaths in
July 06, 2009 []. The circumstances surrounding the emergence of
this pathogen, and the factors that facilitated the initial cross-species
transmission, are still not fully understood. It became apparent in the
early days of the outbreak that the virus can be directly transmitted
between humans. Among the various efforts made to evaluate,
diagnose and implement measures against the spread of virus, is the
timely release of the genomic sequences from different viral isolates.

The notorious 1918 influenza pandemic‐deservedly known as the
“mother of all pandemics”‐infected more than one quarter of the
world's population and claimed an estimated 20 to 50 million human
lives []. Two features of the influenza virus, compounded by current
globalization trends, explain its ability to become a particularly
worrisome zoonotic threat. One feature is the high error rate during
genomic replication, which is typical of RNA viruses. The other is the
segmented influenza virus genome, which facilitates re-assortment
between different viral strains that infect the same cell. At a time when
air travel makes it possible to reach the most remote corners of the
planet in a matter of hours, any emerging or re-emerging infectious
disease stops being a local issue and instead becomes a global medical
and public health priority. Details of how the current influenza virus
emerged, although still scarce, will enhance our knowledge about
factors that enable viruses to cross the species barrier and cause disease
in humans []. Hence, keeping above things in our mind our lab has
started analyses of this new (2009) human H1N1 virus and compared
it with others H1N1 and H1N2 viruses from human, swine and avian
during the outbreak occurred in 1918-2008.

Methodology
Nucleotide and protein sequences of haemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA) were downloaded form NCBI database
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/INFLUENZA). Blast server at NCBI
was used to identify the sequences identity (Nucleotide and Protein).
Alignments of the selected sequences of HA and NA genes were
performed by ClustalW program with default parameters [].
Phylogenetic tree was built by Neighbour-joining method with
Kimura-2 parameter, performed in Phylip3.65 package
(http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html). Phylogenies
were determined by bootstrap analyses of 1000 replicates using
seqboot program available in Phylip3.65 package. Phylogenetic tree
was drawn by TreeView1.6 program
(http://taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview). Glycosylation sites
were identified by Scanprosite (http://expasy.org/tools/scanprosite) at
Expasy server.

Discussion
Pigs have been known as “mixing vessel” [] and thus play a vital role
in interspecies transmission of influenza viruses. A novel 2009 human
H1N1 virus, circulating in USA, Europe and Asia is known to be a reassorted
virus. Thus to trace out the origin of this novel human H1N1
virus, we performed the phylogenetic analyses of two surface proteins
(HA and NA).

The haemagglutinin (HA) sequences of three strains form 2009
outbreak (two from U.S.A and one from Asia) clustered with the swine
influenza sequences from H1N2 subtype recovered from 1999-2004
outbreaks in U.S.A (). The HA gene sequences of all the
three isolates shared highest homology over 95% and 93% at
nucleotide and protein level was found with H1N2 strain from Indiana
and H1N1 strain from Kansas, respectively (Table 1 in
). In contrast, the segment coding for
neuraminidase gene (NA) of new human virus clustered with the
swine influenza viruses from Asia and Europe from 1992-2007
outbreaks (). However the NA genes of three isolates from
2009 outbreak showed highest homology over 94% and 92% to H1N1
strain from England and H1N1 strain from Belgium, respectively
(Table 1 in  ). Whereas H1N1 strain from
Zhejiang shared at least 91% homology both at nucleotide and protein
level. Thus our result suggests that the neuraminidase gene segment
lies with in the Eurasian swine genetic lineage, which also
corroborates with a recent report by Garten et al []. However all the
humans isolates from H1N1 subtype recovered from 1995 to 2008 fail
to clustered with these novel strains and able to make separate
clustered . The HA and NA, genes from 2009 outbreak showed
homology to 77% to 80% strains clustered in this group. Comparing
the HA and NA genes from virus with 1918 outbreak we found that
this novel virus shared at least 85% and 83% homology respectively.

Alignment of HA1 amino acids sequences from 1918-2009 are shown
in . Five conserved amino acids Tyr95, Tyr136, Trp153,
His183, Tyr195 are highlighted at receptor-binding site of H1 which
have been described by Skehel and Wiley []. With H1, SA binding
was specific for the NeuAcα2,6 Gal linkage due to amino acids Asp-
190 and Asp-225, Although Mexican (2009) H1 isolate had Gly225
which is similar to isolates from Swine Influenza Virus during 1980
and 1997 outbreaks in USA. Mutation at position 225 may effect the
binding to NeuAcα2, 6 Gal SA but further needs to be validated by
experimental approach. At least six potential glycosylation sites have
been identified at position 27-30, 28-31, 40-43, 104-107, 293- 296,
304-307 at H1 in new human 2009 strains. All the glycosylation sites
were related to Swine Influenza Virus H1 viruses recovered from
1999-2001 outbreaks and that include subtype H1N2 and H1N1 in
U.S.A (data not shown). These data suggest novel H1N1 virus was
genetically related to viruses form swine H1N2 and H1N1 subtypes
which give strong indication of re‐assortment. With the novel 2009
virus, the amino acid sequence at receptor‐binding site was similar to
H1 of Swine influenza virus and human isolates from 1918-2008
outbreaks, which further implicate the conserved pattern of receptor
binding in present H1N1 virus.

Previous reports suggested that mutations at amino acid H274Y and
N294S made strain resistant to available drug oseltamivir []. Thus to
investigate whether available drugs (oseltamivir, zanamivir) may be
effective against the recent circulating virus, we performed the amino
acids sequence alignment of NA gene with previous strains. The result
revealed that no mutation was found in the conserved region of active
site (data not shown), which is the potential target for the existing
drugs. Thus, conserved pattern at active site of NA suggests that the
virus will remain sensitive to the pre-existing therapeutic strategies.

Conclusion
This study precisely intrigue to investigate the origin of novel virus
(2009) subtype H1N1 (based on two surface proteins HA &amp; NA)
prevalent in humans. Our Insilco analyses revealed that this is a reassorted
virus, where swine may constitute a crucial intermediate host
for transmission. Furthermore, the study also predicts the presence of
conserved domains in both the surface proteins, which could be of
therapeutic relevance.

A Neighbour‐Joining phylogenetic tree from nucleotide sequences of HA (a) and NA(b) of selected influenza A viruses. The tree was
rooted to A/South Carolina/1/18(H1N1) for HA and A/Brevig Mission/1/18(H1N1) for NA. Robustness of individual nodes of the tree was
determined by using boot strap analyses at 1000 replicates.
