Background
Influenza continues to be a major cause for concern worldwide due to the
considerable human suffering and economic burden afflicted by the periodic
epidemics. The occurrence of the repeated epidemics is due to effective evasion
of herd immunity in host populations by the Influenza A viruses through
antigenic variation in the surface proteins. Influenza A viruses have two surface
glycoproteins– hemaglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), both of which
undergo extensive antigenic variation. Thus, Influenza A viruses escape
neutralization by host antibodies through accumulated mutations (antigenic
drift) in these proteins or by introducing new variants of these by genetic reassortments
(antigenic shift) as in case of the recent H1N1 Swine flu pandemic
of 2009 []. 
The antigenic variations in HA and NA proteins necessitates new
vaccine strains to be updated frequently and hence constitutes a major
challenge to effective vaccine design []. The HA protein is a trimer of
identical subunits each of which consists of two chains HA1 and HA2 with 329
and 175 amino acids respectively. Of these, HA1 has been found to mutate
more frequently [–]. 
Though NA also acquires mutations, it is considered
less relevant because of its relatively less prevalence on the virion surface and
limited interactions with antibodies []. 
Hence, studies on antigenic variability
have mostly concentrated on HA proteins [,
,
,
].

Periodic outbreaks of influenza epidemics due to H3N2 subtype strains have
also mostly occurred due to antigenic drifts or shifts, which did effectively
overcome the existing herd immunity in the population. However, a reassortant
virus possessing an avian H3 hemaglutinin and all other genes of the
previously circulating human strain were responsible for the 1968 H3N2
pandemic []. 
Further, the 2003-2004 epidemic of H3N2 was primarily due to
the proliferation of the new H3N2 subtype strain A/Fujian/411/2002 (an
antigenic drift mutant of the A/Panama/2007/99 strain), with the existing
vaccine failing to offer any protection [,
]. Though evolution of H3N2 in
terms of antigenic variability has been studied, to the best of our knowledge,
reports about antigen-antibody interactions involving HA proteins of H3N2
viruses are sparse. In order to understand the antigenic drift and host-pathogen
interactions, we investigated the antigenic variability of HA proteins in strains
of influenza A/H3N2 in the light of antigen-antibody interactions using
bioinformatics tools for molecular docking. The motivation for the present
study originated from the reported ineffectiveness of a vaccine based on Hong
Kong strain of the 1968 pandemic (equivalent of A/Aichi/2/1968 (X31)) to
provide protection against the infection due to strain A/Port Chalmers/1/1973
[].

Methodology
The dataset
The HA amino acid sequences for the following WHO recommended vaccine
strains of influenza A/H3N2 virus were downloaded from the SwissProt
database: A/Duck/Ukraine/1/1963 (UKR63), A/Aichi/2/1968 (X31),
A/Albany/1/1970 (ALB70), A/Port Chalmers/1/1973 (PC73),
A/Philippines/2/1982 (PH82), A/Sydney/5/1997 (SYD97), A/Moscow/10/1999
(MOS99), A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (WIS05), A/Brisbane/10/2007 (BR07) and
A/Perth/16/2009 (PR09). The names in parenthesis will be used henceforth in
the present paper. The structural information for the strains X-31 and UKR63
were retrieved from the Protein Databank (PDB IDs: 1EO8 and 1MQL
respectively). The known structure of X-31 HA protein complexed with
antibody BH151 (derived from a survivor of the 1968 influenza A/H3N2
pandemic) has been considered as a reference for the study.

Phylogenetic analyses
Sequence-based phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the Molecular
Evolutionary Genetic Analyses (MEGA 4.0) package. Multiple sequence
alignment was carried out with ClustalW implementation in MEGA4 
[] with
default parameters. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighborjoining
algorithm and bootstrap (10,000 replications) was used as a test of
phylogeny.

Antigenic variability
In silico prediction of antigenic determinants was performed for each sequence
of the dataset using the Kolaskar method [] as implemented in the B-cell
epitope prediction server at Immune Epitope Database (IEDB;
www.immuneepitope.org/). 
The known antigenic regions [] were also
compared with the predictions. The antigenic distance between any two strains
(newer vs older) can be measured in terms of the fraction of amino acids that
differ between them in the epitope regions. Such a measure is defined by pepitope
[]. Calculation is given in Supplementary material.

3D structure prediction and analyses
The 3D structures of the HA proteins from strains ALB70, PC73, PH82,
MOS99, WIS05 and BR07 have been predicted using the SwissModel online
workstation. The template chosen (based on the automatic template selection
mode) was the HA protein of X-31 (PDB ID: 1EO8). Energy minimization of
the modeled structures and structural comparisons were performed using the
GROMOS96 force field application in Swiss PDB-Viewer (SPDBV) 
[].
Predicted structures were evaluated using PROCHECK analyses 
[].
Visualization of all the molecules and rendering of images was carried out in
Discovery Studio v.2.0 (Accelyrs Inc., USA). The surface electrostatics of the
proteins was studied using NOC software [].

Molecular docking
Computational docking, a method which predicts the preferred stable
orientation of one molecule when bound to a second one, was carried out to
determine the binding site and the residues interacting between the antigens
and antibody through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and salt bridges. In silico
docking of antibody BH151against the HA proteins of ALB70, PC73, PH82,
MOS99 and BR07 has been carried out using the ZDOCK server with default
parameters [,
]. 
As a precondition for docking in each case, the following
amino acids on the variable heavy chain of antibody BH151 were desired to
form the binding interface between antigen and antibody: T31, Y32, R94, R98
and W100. However, no such constrains were imposed on any amino acid on
the antigens. From the ten solutions returned by ZDOCK in each case, the best
solution was selected based on the following conditions: i) the complimentarity
determining regions (CDRs) of the antibody interacting with the antigen at the
antigen-antibody interface and ii) the value of minimized energy of the
complex being the least (energetically favourable). The details of contacts
between amino acids of antigen and antibody for each complex were obtained
by Contacts of Structural Units (CSU) analyses [].

Discussion
The HA sequences from various strains were subjected to pairwise comparison
(all possible pairs within the data set) using the ALIGN tool (EMBL server).
Identity (%) and similarity (%) were calculated from these alignments (
see ). Maximum identity (98.6%) and similarity
(99.1%) in amino acid composition has been observed between the strains X-31
and ALB70. Phylogenetic analyses further indicated the clustering of the
sequences and placed both X-31 and ALB70 in one clade (see
). The multiple sequence alignment indicated the
occurrence of mutations in the various strains with respect to X-31. Compared
to the X-31 there were 21, 7, 18, 41, 66, 64, 78, 76 &amp; 76 mutations in the
sequences UKR63, ALB70, PC73, PH82, SYD97, MOS99, WIS05, BR07 and
PR09 respectively. The number of mutations between X-31 and ALB70 were
found to be 7 with only 3 mutations in the epitope regions (see
). The stretches that record maximum variations in
amino acid composition are: 151-162, 170-180 and 200-210 (as per numbering
of complete amino acid sequences as in ).

The antigenic evolution has been determined in terms of mutations in the
epitope regions.  describes the antigenic distances of various strains
with respect to X-31, for the known epitopes A, B, C, D and E, evaluated in
terms of pepitope. It can be seen from the graph that antigenic distance is least
between X-31 and ALB70 with no mutations in the epitopes A, B and C.
Comparatively, the antigenic distance is higher between X-31 and PC73 with
many mutations in the epitope regions. The antigenic distance of PH82,
MOS99, WIS05 and BR07 with respect to X-31 is high for all the epitopes.
Maximum antigenic variability is observed in the epitope B within the data set
considered (). The number of mutations with respect to X-31 in the
known epitopes of HA proteins from various strains has been enlisted in 
(see ). Other studies have also revealed the high
mutation rates in epitopes A and B [] with the emergence of fresh outbreaks
coinciding with drastic changes in one or more epitopes simultaneously [].
For structure-based analyses, following representative strains were considered:
ALB70, PC73, PH82, MOS99, WIS05 and BR07. The 3D structures of these
proteins were predicted by homology modelling with HA of X-31 (1E08) as the
default template. The target–template identity of sequence composition along
with the results of PROCHECK analyses (amino acid occupancy in
Ramachandran Plot) and the minimized energy values of structures have been
summarized in (see ). For the predicted
structures of HA, the occupancy of amino acids in Ramachandran plot was
above 96% indicating that the models were good and reliable.

Docking of BH151 antibody onto the 3D structures of HA proteins was carried
out to determine the binding site and the residues interacting within the
antigen-antibody complex through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and salt bridges.
The BH151 antibody docked into the antigenic site E of ALB70 HA and the
complex was stabilized by the formation of H-bonds. The minimized total
energy of the X-31 HA-BH151 co-crystal was -43891.53 KJ/mol while that of
the ALB70 HA-BH151 complex was -40219.512 KJ/mol. However, in
comparison with X-31 HA-BH151 co-crystal, some changes were observed in
the orientation of the antibody (). The root mean squared deviation
(RMSD) between the two complexes was found to be ˜1.8 Ǻ (considering 664
backbone atoms of both antigen and antibody). The Contacts of Structural
Units analyses (CSU Analyses) (Sobolev et al., 1999) of the ALB70 HABH151
docked complex revealed that only four residues of the HCDRs are
interacting with the antigen through hydrogen bonding. Formation of Hbonds
was observed between the residues Y32 and T31 of (HCDR1) of BH151 with
the residues K156 and N112 of the site E of HA respectively. Also, the residues
R98 and G97 of HCDR3 of BH151 respectively formed Hbonds with the
residues D93 and P90 of site E of HA (see )
(Please refer to  for the annotations of epitopes). The mutations
D79N and N97D in the epitope E of ALB70 did not drastically affect the 3D
conformation or the surface electrostatics, though the first one resulted in a loss
of Hbond formation with antibody. The D79N mutation created a potential
glycosylation site at position 79, whereas the N97D resulted in the loss of
glycosylation site at position in ALB70 compared to X-31.

On the other hand, when the docking of BH151onto the HA of PC73, UKR63,
PH82, MOS99, WIS05 and BR07 was carried out, the antibody could not
recognize antigenic site E or other known antigenic sites. In each case, the
ZDOCK output returned docking orientations that are physically unrealistic
and non-feasible under natural physiological conditions. This is because some
of the amino acids on the HA proteins of these strains interacting with the
docked antibody actually remain inaccessible for antibodies in the HA prefusion
trimer under natural physiological conditions. The failure of BH151 to
recognize and bind to the HA of PC73 is (probably) due to the mutations V94G
(w.r.t both ALB70 and X-31) at site E and D291G in the vicinity, which not
only altered the surface contour without drastically changing the fold of the
backbone but also changed the surface electrostatics from negative to positive
potential (). These mutations were retained in the subsequent
strains (PH82, MOS99, WIS05 and BR07). However, the comparison of the
surface electrostatics () revealed that the HAs of X31 and ALB70
are almost identical whereas those from PC73 and others are very dissimilar in
spite of the antigenic distance being less (pepitope =0.0526). The varied surface
electrostatics along with the conformational deviation in the E site may be
responsible for BH151 not recognizing the HA proteins from PC73 and other
strains. The mutation D79N in PC73 (w.r.t X-31) also resulted in the creation
of a potential glycosylation site at position 79. Thus, the E epitope of PC73 HA
possesses two glycosylation sites. Also, the antibody failed to recognize and
bind to the HA of UKR63 because of dissimilar surface electrostatics and
differences in amino acid compositions at antigenic site E as well as overall.
The antigenic distance in terms of pepitope value between UKR63 and X-31 for
all the antigenic regions ranged from 0.078 to 0.107 (). This
outcome, however, is not far from expectation since the X-31 is not a direct
descendant from the UKR63 strain and possessed an avian H3 HA [].

Overall, antigenic variability between the various strains of H3N2 viruses have
been studied. Though the epitopes of ALB70 were very similar to that on X-31,
considerable differences existed between those on X-31 and other strains
evolving from 1973 onwards. The docking of BH151 onto the ALB70 HA
revealed that the antibody recognizes the similar antigenic determinant on HA
of strain ALB70. Compared to the co-crystal of X-31 HA − BH151, we noted a
loss of few contacts and a gain of a few in the ALB70 HA − BH151 docked
complex. The ALB70 HA − BH151complex was stable and comparable to the
original X31 HA − BH151 co-crystal. However, the antibody failed to
recognize and bind to HA from PC73 and subsequent strains. It was noted that
even two amino acid changes in the epitope E (of PC73 w.r.t X-31) resulted in
altered surface electrostatics sufficient to affect the nature of interactions with
antibody BH151. The HA proteins of strains with greater antigenic distances
from the X-31 strain could not be recognized by BH151.

Conclusion
The antigenic evolution of HA proteins from vaccine strains of influenza
A/H3N2 has been studied over the period 1968-2007 and variability in terms of
antigenic distances have been observed for all the epitopes. The structural basis
for the antibody BH151 not recognizing the HAs of 1973 and subsequently
evolved strains could be explained through molecular docking studies. The
results revealed the molecular basis for reported failure of the vaccine based on
the Hong Kong strain of the 1968 pandemic to provide protection against strain
A/Port Chalmers/1/1973. Further, even two amino acid changes were found to
be sufficient to alter the antigenicity and surface properties of the epitopes in
HA proteins. Overall, our study reflects the highly specific nature of antigenantibody
interactions and gives insight into the molecular basis of host-immune
evasion by influenza viruses.
