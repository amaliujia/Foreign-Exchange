Background
Thiopurine drugs including 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), 6-
thioguanine, and azathioprine have wide clinical applications
ranging from immunosuppressants for preventing graft-rejection in
organ transplant patients, to treatment of diseases such as childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, autoimmune disorder, and
inflammatory bowel disease [–]. The toxicity of these drugs is
ameliorated by conversion to methylated forms by the thiopurine S-methyltransferase
enzyme (TPMT), which uses S-adenosyl-Lmethionine
(AdoMet), as a methyl donor. As a result of the transfer
of the methyl group, AdoMet is converted to Sadenosylhomocysteine
(AdoHcy). Mutations in the TPMT gene that
reduce or abolish TPMT functions lead to decreased thiopurine drug
methylation, resulting in cytotoxicity and cell death [–]. To
understand the pharmacogenetics of TPMT and 6MP, X-ray cocrystal
structures of TPMT complexes with AdoHcy(CH2)6MP are
required. However, the co-crystal structure of this complex has not
been reported because 6MP is poorly water soluble []. To address
this problem, we modeled the AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex in the
human TPMT active site and performed 1300 picoseconds (ps)
molecular dynamic (MD) simulations to investigate the atomic
interactions and dynamic properties of TPMT, AdoHcy, and 6MP.

Methodology
Preparation of protein initial structure
The X-ray crystal structure of the TPMT-AdoHcy complex was
obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB identifier: 2H11).
Missing atoms and missing residues identified in this structure were
corrected using the SwissPdb program []. The structure of 6MP
was retrieved from the ChemBank Database (ChemBank identifier:
1116).

Preparation of AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex
The X-ray crystal structure of murine TPMT, which is 77%
identical to human TPMT, bound with AdoHcy and 6MP was
recently published (PDB identifier: 3BGD) []. The intersulfur
distance between AdoHcy and 6MP molecules is 3.41 Å, which is
approximatly double the 1.85 Å length of a sulfur-carbon single
bond, suggesting that the methyl group is directly transferred from
the donor to the acceptor by SN2-like mechanism. 6MP interacts
with AdoHcy by pointing its sulfur atom towards the sulfur atom of
AdoHcy. These two sulfur atoms form a bridge through the CH2
group in the middle. Previous human TPMT-6MP modeling study
suggested that 6MP interacts with TPMT by forming water bridges
using its nitrogen atoms at the pentagonal and hexagonal rings with
the nitrogen atoms of Lys32 and Arg226 side chains [] ().

The 6MP structure was manually placed in the human TPMT active
site by adaptation of the potential binding modes previously
suggested by crystallography []. The AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex
was modeled by adding a CH2 group to the sulfur atom of the
AdoHcy structure. The same carbon atom was then used as a
reference point for placing the 6MP structure. The sulfur atom of
the 6MP was placed next to the AdoHcy structure to form a bond
with the reference carbon atom. Both structures were arranged on
the same plane. Finally, atomic charges were assigned to the
complex as shown in . The AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex
was used as an initial ligand structure for MD simulation and as a
reference for root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculations for
all AdoHcy(CH2)6MP trajectories.

MD simulations
The AMBER v.9 package [,]
 was used to prepare the protein
and the ligand files as well as the MD simulations. Topology and
parameter files for TPMT, AdoHcy, and 6MP were generated using
“ff03” all-atom AMBER force field. The complex was solvated in
the octahedron box of TIP3P water with 10 Å distance between the
protein surface and the box boundary. Sodium and chloride ions
were added to neutralize the system. The SHAKE algorithm []
was applied to all bonds containing hydrogen atoms with the time
step parameter set to 2 femtoseconds.

The energy minimization and MD simulations were carried out
using the SANDER program in the AMBER package. Three
thousand energy minimization steps (steepest descent for 1000 steps
and then conjugate gradient for 2000 steps) were applied to the
initial TPMT-AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex to relieve atomic clashes
and bad contacts. After energy minimization, MD simulations were
performed using protein-atom restrained simulations for 20 ps and a
harmonic potential with a 10 kcal/mol force constant, followed by
1300 ps all-atom unrestrained simulation. The trajectories of the
entire system were recorded every 10 ps. The molecular dynamic of
the complex was terminated when the simulation reached 1300 ps.
The PDB structures of the last 100 ps were extracted from the MD
simulated trajectories to generate the average structure, which was
subsequently used for 6MP binding mode and the corresponding
interaction analysis.

Discussion
After the MD simulation, we calculated RMSDs between Cα of
TPMT trajectories recorded every 10 ps and Cα of their X-ray
crystal structure. The RMSDs for the trajectories of the
AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex were also calculated using its initial
model as a reference structure. The results in  show that the
RMSDs of both TPMT and AdoHcy(CH2)6MP trajectories were
always less than 1.50 Å for the entire simulation. The trajectories
were not greatly different from the X-ray crystal structure, with only
minor movements of the Cα of TPMT observed. This indicates that
our simulation system was stable. The simulation length used in this
study was long enough to allow rearrangement of TPMT side chains
and the AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex to find their most stable
binding mode.

We verified the quality of our model by using PROCHECK [].
The results show that all protein residues were in the most favored
regions (90.0%) or in the additional allowed regions (10.0%) with
the overall PROCHECK score of -0.28, which was in the
recommended range. The Ramachandran plot also indicates that our
model is reasonable with respect to the overall folds and dihedral
angles. The PDB trajectories of the complex may be obtained at

 depicts the binding mode of 6MP and its interactions
with human TPMT and AdoHcy predicted using MD simulation.
The binding modes and the interactions of AdoHcy with the amino
acid side chains in the vicinity of the TPMT active site are similar to
those observed in the X-ray crystal structures (2H11 and 3BGD).
The RMSDs between Cα of our model and the published X-ray
crystal structures of human TPMT and murine TPMT (2H11 and
3BGD) are 1.28 Å and 1.24 Å, respectively.

The inter sulfur distance between AdoHcy and 6MP molecules of
our model is 3.40 Å (), consistent with that of murine
TPMT-AdoHcy-6MP X-ray crystal structure 3BGD (3.41 Å)
() []. Our model shows that the location of nitrogen
atoms in the pentagonal ring (N3 and N4) of 6MP are positioned
4.00 and 5.24 Å from Pro196 and Arg226 side chains while a
nitrogen atom in the hexagonal ring (N1) is positioned 3.60 Å from
Phy40 of TPMT (). These distances and the underlying
conformation correspond with the murine TPMT-AdoHcy X-ray
crystal structures in  []. The binding modes of 6MP
observed in our model and the X-ray crystal structure [] also
indicate that 6MP is stabilized in the TPMT active site by nonbonded
interactions with Phe40, Arg152, Pro195, Pro196, Arg226
side chains.

Enzymatic activity and mutagenesis studies of human TPMT
mutants have shown that amino acid substitutions in the TPMT
active site (Arg at residues 152 and 226 to Ala, Glu or His) alter the
Km and Vmax values for 6MP []. Mutations of non-active-site
residues (for example, residues 80, 132, 180 and 240) also greatly
reduce the enzymatic activity of TPMT (to one third of the wild
type activity) []. This information suggests that the dynamics of
TPMT structure and structural distortion resulting from mutations
of active-site and non-active-site residues play important roles in
formation of TPMT-AdoHcy-6MP complex. The flexible loops in
the TPMT structure have been proposed to contribute to structural
rearrangements affecting ligand binding, TPMT function as well as
enzymatic activity [,]. However, loop rearrangement was not
observed in our model. The MD simulation performed in this study
was considerably too short to observe the movements of these
loops.

Conclusion
We used MD simulation to predict the structure of the complex of
human TPMT-AdoHcy(CH2)6MP, where the sulfur atoms of
AdoHcy and 6MP were linked by a CH2 group. After 1300 ps of
MD simulation, the trajectory showed that 6MP was stabilized in
the TPMT active site by formation of non-bonded interactions
between 6MP and Phe40, Pro196 and Arg226 side chains of TPMT.
The intersulfur distance between AdoHcy and 6MP as well as the
binding modes and the interactions of our TPMT-AdoHcy model
are consistent with those observed in the X-ray crystal structure of
murine TPMT-AdoHcy-6MP complex. Our model provides
structural insights into the interactions of TPMT, AdoHcy, and 6MP
at the atomic level, which may be used as a starting point for further
study of thiopurine drug pharmacogenetics.

Possible binding modes and interactions of 6MP against TPMT and AdoMet previously suggested by crystallography [] (A and
B). We modeled the AdoHcy(CH2)6MP complex, where the sulfur atom of 6MP was placed next to the AdoMet structure, forming a bridge
with the sulfur atom of AdoMet through the CH2 group (C).

Plot of root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Cα-TPMT (black) and AdoHcy-6MP complex (gray) trajectories against the initial
model. The trajectories were captured every 10 ps until the simulation time reached 1300 ps. The RMSD of both structures are always less than
1.50 Å for the entire simulation indicating high stability of the complex.

Binding mode and interactions of 6MP against TPMT and AdoHcy. From our MD simulations, the trajectory shows that 6MP
interacts with AdoMet through the CH2 group by pointing its sulfur atom toward the sulfur atom of AdoMet and interacts with Phe40,
Pro195, Pro196 and Arg226 of TPMT by non-bonded interactions (A). AdoHcy interacts with amino acid side chains lining in the TPMT
active site, i.e. Trp33, Leu69, Cys70, Glu90, Ile91, Ile135 and Arg152, which consistent with those interactions observed in murine TPMTAdoHcy-
6MP X-ray crystal structures (B) [].
