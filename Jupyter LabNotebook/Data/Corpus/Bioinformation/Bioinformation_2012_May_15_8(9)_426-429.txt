Background
Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are essential components of
all biological processes such as oncogenesis []. Several
observations suggested that mortalin is involved in the
transformation of normal cells to cancer-cells [], which
mortalin interacted with p53 that promotes sequestration of p53
in the cytoplasm, thereby inhibiting its nuclear activity [] and
induce the resistance of tumors in radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. Mortalin changes its sub-cellular location from
mitochondria of normal cells to cytosol, of cancerous cells [].
Protein of p53, the “guardian of the genome,” is a major player
in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to the diverse
endogenous and exogenous stress signals []. The p53 is a
tumor suppressor that is essential for the prevention of cancer
development [] . Loss of p53 function is one of the early events
in immortalization of human cells []. Another function of p53,
independent to its nuclear localization, is to regulate
mitochondrial membrane potential by interactions with the
mitochondrial proteins bcl2 and mortalin []. Furthermore
inhibition of p53-mortalin complex using small molecule is
promising strategy to find drug materials for cancer therapy
since the small molecules able to inhibit interaction between
two proteins []. However study interaction p53-mortalin and
its inhibition using small molecule is still challenging because
specific site of mortalin that bind to p53, vice versa, is still
debatable. Experimental analysis by truncated protein
recombinant suggested that mortalin-binding site of p53 was
localized to the tetramerization domain, namely amino acids
323–337 residues []. Conversely, the binding site for p53 on
mortalin was mapped to amino acids 253–282 residues, in the
ATPase domain []. Otherwise Iosefson demonstrated that p53
binds to the peptide-binding domain of mortalin and not to the
ATP-binding site of mortalin []. P53 harbors two binding sites
for mortalin. The first one was previously determined to be in
the tetramerization domain [], and the second is found in the
C-terminal domain []. Moreover we elucidated the binding
site in both of the protein (p53 and mortalin) by molecular
docking method. The docking method was powerful to predict
specific binding site of protein-protein complex []. Here we
demonstrated that mortalin-binding site of p53 reside in 326 to
341 residues, and p53-binding site of mortalin hold in range 423
to 450 residues. Based on the binding activity, then we analyzed
its binding stability when been interfered with small molecule
to obtain drug candidate for cancer therapy. Furthermore we
identified small molecules inhibitor of p53-mortalin complex.
Here we found 3 drug-like compounds from Zinc database that
potentially abrogate p53-mortalin interaction using Virtual
Screening.

Methodology
Retrieval of Target Sequence:
The amino acid sequence of mortalin ID: NP_000537.3 was
obtained from the sequence database of NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and model of p53 (1AIE) was
from PDB BANK (http://www.rscb.org).

Modeling proteins mortalin:
The tertiary structure of mortalin is not available in the protein
structure databases, and then the structure was predicted by
comparative modeling using MODELLER (PS2 Server) []. The
predicted three dimension (3D) structures were validated using
the PROCHECK to evaluate backbone conformation based on
Psi/Phi Ramachandran plot analysis.

Docking protein – protein:
We used cons-PPISP to predict a site for interaction of p53 and
mortalin. The input is the unbound structure of a protein, which
is known to bind another protein []. Then we used the
PatchDock algorithm (rigid docking) to compute possible
interaction p53 with mortalin based on its interaction site.
Output of rigid docking was refined using FireDock. FireDock
refines the candidate models according to an energy function
[]. 
Thereafter, we used FiberDock software to simulate most
possible native complex structure of mortalin-p53 in flexible
mode, which are include both backbone and side-chains
movements [].

Ligand Preparation:
About 9000 drug-like compounds were downloaded from zinc
database (http://zinc.docking.org), then its energy form were
minimized and converted to pdbqt format by Open Babel in
PyRx 0.8 [] as ligand for virtual screening.

Virtual Screening:
Identifications small molecules targeted mortalin was done by
docking of the entire 9000 drug-like compounds from ZINC
database against p53-binding domain of mortalin using
AutoDock Vina in PyRx 0.8 (Virtual Screening Tools) [].
Virtual screening is now established as an effective paradigm
for filtering compounds for drug discovery process []. The
grid for docking calculations was centered on p53-binding
domain of mortalin. The best three of drug-like compounds
from virtual screening were taken on the basis of higher scoring
function for pharmachopore modeling, which is one of the most
powerful techniques to classify and identify key features from a
group of molecules. LigandScout was used to develop
pharmacophore and molecular interaction of these three druglike.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation:
The binding stability of p53-mortalin complex before and after
interference by the small molecules was simulated using
GroGUI 0.5.2 version of GROMACS MD simulation package.
The first steps are preparation of the atomic and topology of
ligand, receptor and the small molecules. Second steps are
made box water for simulation and then energy minimization is
performed in order to eliminate potential geometric problems in
the protein and ligand structures, such as unrealistic bond
distances, bond angles and torsion angles. Next step involved
the equilibration of the solute molecules with a fixed
configuration of the solvent molecules in which the system was
heated 300K with Berendsen temperature coupling and
Pressure coupling with Parrinello-Rahman (isotropic). The
Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method was used to treat longrange
electrostatic interactions. The coordinates of the trajectory
was sampled every 2.5 ps for analysis of the energy stabilization
Plots for potential energy, RMSD fluctuations, involving p53-
mortalin and other complexes [].

Visualization:
All the visualization of the structure files were done using
PyMol molecular graphics system (www.pymol.org).

Discussion
Designing anti-cancer drug targeted p53 protein 
[] or p53
binding-domain of mortalin is very promising 
[]. However
the p53-binding site of mortalin still debatable 
[] 
[], then we
analyzed the binding site based on their interaction using
molecular docking. Since the three dimensions (3D) structure of
mortalin was still not available yet then we used 3D model of
mortalin to determine it's binding to p53 protein. Model 3D of
mortalin was determined by comparative modeling using
MODELLER (PS2 Server). The quality and reliability of the
model was ensured by assessing the backbone conformation,
angels and bond lengths based on Psi/Phi Ramachandran plot
using PROCHECK, it showed a total of 93.7% residues in the
most favored regions ().

Furthermore, we used the valid model to analyze p53-binding
site of mortalin based on the flexible docking. The result
showed that the lowest energy binding of p53-mortalin complex
is -31.89 kcal/mol, and p53 protein bind to substrate binding
domain of mortalin (THR433; VAL435; LEU436; LEU437;
PRO442; ILE558; LYS555) (). The result suggested that
mortalin-binding site of p53 reside in 326 to 341 residues, in
accordance with opinion Kaul et al (1998) 
[], and p53-binding
site of mortalin in 423 to 450 residues that it strengthens
Iosefson data (2010) [].

The p53-binding domain of mortalin was used as receptor to
screen 9000 drug-like compounds (small molecules) from ZINC
database. The screening was performed using molecular
docking program AutoDock Vina in PyRx 0.8 (Virtual Screening
Tools) []. The virtual screening obtained the best three druglike
molecules that are ZINC01019934, ZINC00624418 and
ZINC00664532, which are require smaller energy than other
molecules to bind with mortalin (). These data
indicated that the three molecules were able bond strongly to
p53-binding site of mortalin and its binding will inhibit p53
protein interact to mortalin. Then we evaluated interaction of
the three molecules to the p53-mortalin complex by docking
followed with ligandscout. The result demonstrated that the
three molecules bound to amino acid in center of the active site
of both mortalin and p53, which are essential for establishment
p53-mortalin complex (). Hereafter, we evaluated the
binding stability of the three molecules to p53-mortalin complex
using GroGUI 0.5.2 version of GROMACS molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation package []. MD simulations have provided
detailed information on the fluctuations and conformational
changes in protein complex [].

The simulation described that the three molecules interrupted
stability of p53-mortalin complex. This is indicated by an
increase binding energy of mortalin-p53 complex and root
mean square deviations (RMSD) of the protein complexes have
changed significantly after added with the small molecule
(). Taken together the results suggested that the three
molecules have potency to abrogate p53-mortalin interaction
that warrant for anticancer agent. Therefore further experiment
to examine its activities in vitro and in vivo to cure cancer is still
shall to be done.

Conclusion
These studies could be concluded that p53-binding site of
mortalin reside in substrate binding domain, 423 to 450
residues. We have identified three drug-like molecules that are
ZINC01019934, ZINC00624418 and ZINC00664532 adequate to
interrupt stability of p53-mortalin complex that warrant for
anticancer agent.
