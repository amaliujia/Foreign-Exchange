liver damage which in turn can cause death of patients. HBV DNA Polymerase is essential for HBV replication in the host and
hence is used as one of the most potent pharmacological target for the inhibition of HBV. Chronic hepatitis B is currently treated
with nucleotide analogues that suppress viral reverse transcriptase activity and most of them are reported to have viral resistance.
Therefore, it is of interest to model HBV DNA polymerase to dock known phytochemicals. The present study focuses on homology
modeling and molecular docking analysis of phytocompounds from the traditional antidote Phyllanthus niruri and other nucleoside
analogues against HBV DNA Polymerase using the software Discovery studio 4.0. 3D structure of HBV DNA Polymerase was
predicted based on previously reported alignment. Docking studies revealed that a few phytochemicals from Phyllanthus niruri had
good interactions with HBV DNA Polymerase. These compounds had acceptable binding properties for further in vitro validation.
Thus the study puts forth experimental validation for traditional antidote and these phytocompounds could be further promoted
as potential lead molecule.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes chronic hepatitis infection to
over 350 million people worldwide and it is estimated that over
2 billion people have been exposed to HBV worldwide [1,
2].
The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma associated
with HBV is higher when compared to non- carriers worldwide
and accounts for about 31% of cases [3,
4]. HBV, small doublelayered
virus in the family hepadnaviridae, is a 42 nm partially
double stranded circular DNA virus [5]. Hepadnaviruses are
known to exhibit limited tissue tropisms and host range,
confined to their innate host and a few closely related species
[6]. Chronic hepatitis B is now treated with interferon-α-2a,
interferon-α-2b, lamivudine and nucleotide analogue such as
adefovir dipivoxil which all aim in suppressing viral replication
thereby hindering the progression of disease [7,
8].
Unfortunately currently available drugs have not shown
beneficial effects on the treatment of chronic hepatitis B to a
vast range of patients and are coupled with severe side effects.
Moreover nucleoside or nucleotide analogues induce the
suppression of viral replication during the course of treatment
but have limited long term efficacy [9]. Prolonged use of these
drugs may lead to liver failure, acute infections and are also
associated with a high rate of resistance to the drug [10].

Ayurvedic herbs and formulations have wide spectrum of
therapeutical or biological activity that can be exploited in
pharmaceutical drug discovery and drug design. Traditional
medicines such as Ayurveda, Unani and Chinese are preferred
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B due to lesser side effects
and low cost. Herbal extracts of the genus, Phyllanthus is
composed of various combinations of secondary metabolites
that have shown hepatoprotective effect, the most widely used
ones are Phyllanthus niruri and Phyllanthus amarus 
[11,
12].
Many active compounds were identified from the genus,
Phyllanthus which possess anti HBV activities.
Phytocompounds isolated from Phyllanthus niruri has shown
inhibitory effect on endogenous DNA polymerase and surface
antigen binding property thereby suppressing the replication of
Hepatitis B virus in vitro [13,
14]. Phyllanthus niruri extracts was
also found to inhibit the replication of wood chuck hepatitis
virus (WHV) in vivo and reduce the pathological effects of
WHV in woodchucks (Marmota monax) [15].

DNA polymerase of HBV has been considered as a promising
target for the treatment of HBV infections in the past few years.
Targeting DNA polymerase can inhibit viral replication by
affecting necessary cellular regulatory components that are
coupled with HBV replication and viral nucleo capsid
formation [16]. 
The present study employs an in silico method
to analyze the interaction of HBV DNA polymerase and
phytochemicals from phyllanthus niruri using molecular
docking studies.

Methodology
Homology Modeling of HBV DNA polymerase:
The X-ray structure of Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase
(HBV-DP) has not yet been successfully determined. HIV-1
reverse transcriptase (HIV -1 RT) shares ample structural
similarity with HBV-DP to serve as a good template to predict
the three dimensional structure [17]. HIV-1 RT (template) (PDB
ID: 1RTD) structure was obtained from protein data bank
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). Sequence alignment of HBV-DP
(target) and HIV -1 RT (template) provided by Daga et al; 2010
was utilized for constructing the 3D structure of the target. 3D
model of HBV-DP was generated from the aligned sequence
using “Build homology model” protocol in Discovery Studio. A
total of 20 models were generated. Out of generated models,
one with least Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) score
was utilized for docking studies.

Protein Structure Validation and Active Site Prediction:
Quality of generated model was assessed using “Verify Protein
(Profiles-3D)” protocol of Discovery studio. Validation of the
model was performed using Procheck [18] by analyzing
Ramachandran plot. Structural evaluation and stereochemical
analyses were performed using ProSA-web Z-scores
(https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php) 
[19]. Energy
minimization of the protein structure was performed by
applying “prepare protein” protocol of DS. This protocol cleans
the protein molecule by adding missing atoms, inserting
missing loops, assigning charges and fixing CHARMm
forcefields. Active site of HBV-DP was predicted using “Define
and Edit Binding Site” protocol of Discovery studio.

Ligand Identification, Preparation and Screening:
A total of 35 phytocompounds from Phyllanthus niruri was
collected through literature survey. The 3D structure of 32
compounds was downloaded in .sdf format from PubChem
database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). 3D structure of
3 phytocompounds was generated using Marvin Sketch and
exported in .sdf format for docking studies. All the compounds
were then imported to DS and prepare ligands protocol was
applied in order to add missing hydrogen bonds and energy
minimization using CHARMm force fields. Prepared ligands
were further filtered by applying Lipinski‟s properties such as
Molecular weight, XLog P, number of hydrogen bond donors
and acceptors.

Molecular Docking:
Possible binding modes between the filtered ligands and HBVDP
model were studied by CDOCKER (CHARMm-based
DOCKER) protocol incorporated within DS. The algorithm
offers full ligand flexibly and employs CHARMm force fields.
Ligand binding affinity was calculated using CDOCKER
energy, CDOCKER Interaction energy, Hydrogen bonds,
binding energies, protein energy and ligand protein complex
energy.

Results &amp; Discussion
Homology Model of HBV-DP:
Sequence alignment between HIV -1 RT and HBV -DP in
Clustal format was imported to DS and homology modeling
was performed. Out of 20 models generated, fifth model was
selected for further studies based on minimum DOPE score (-
32517.9). Verify model using profiles 3D was applied to the
model and the verify score was observed as 85.87 that lie
between expected high score of 160.379 and expected low score
of 72.1706. The verified model was then validated using
PROCHECK. 84.3% of residues were found in the most
favorable regions, 12.8% in additional allowed region, 2% in
generously allowed region and 1% residues in disallowed
region of Ramachandran Plot (Figure 1A). Protein structure
analysis using PROSA showed a Z score of -3.39 (Figure 1B).
Selected model produced reliable results in protein verification
steps and hence fourth one was chosen as the model for further
docking analysis. The final structure of HBV-DP is given in
(Figure 1C).

Molecular Docking:
The most critical requirement for interaction of HBV-DP
protein and ligands was the proper orientation and
conformation of ligands into the HBV-DP active site. The active
site prediction protocol of DS produced 15 binding sites from
which 1st active site grid box with dimensions of 52.074 ×22.24
×32.556A° was used. Important amino acids present in active
site of HBV- DP as previously reported is labeled in the
structure and shown in (Figure 2). The active site cleft contains
amino acids LYS32, ARG41, AP83, VAL84, SER85, MET171,
ASP203, MET204, ASP205, ASP206 and ASN236. 35
phytocompounds from Phyllanthus niruri generated 582
conformers of which 60 ligands passed Lipinski's rule. Docking
simulations of HBV-DP active site and ligands were performed
using the CDOCKER algorithm. The binding mode, hydrogen
bond interactions and docking scores for 60 compounds
identified through virtual screening were ranked based on the
different scoring constraints. Based on CDOCKER energy and
CDOCKER interaction energy scores, the binding energy
(ΔGbindkacl/mol) for 11 inhibitors were calculated and
represented in Table 1 (see supplementary material). The
binding energies were observed in the range of -53 to -283.
Phyllanthose (binding energy –132.3977 kcal/mol) showed
maximum number of hydrogen bond interactions (9nos) with
the target of which most of them (7 bonds) were with active site
residues.

Ethyl brevifolincarboxylate (binding energy -195.409kcal/mol)
and astragalin (binding energy -195.431kcal/mol) showed 7
hydrogen bonds with HBV-DP. Active site residues involved in
hydrogen bond interactions of astragalin was less compared to
ethyl brevifolincarboxylate. However the compound found to
have the least binding energy (–283.757 kcal/mol) was
quercitrin. The compound showed hydrogen bond interactions
with Lys32, Asn36, Val84 and Asp205, residues in the binding
pocket of HBV-DP. The second ranked compound based on
binding energy was quercetin (-263.645) which showed
hydrogen bond interactions with Lys32, Asn36 and Arg41.
Comparative docking studies were performed using
commercial nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine,
tenofovir, telbivudine, and entecavir with the modeled protein.
Result showed that analogue tenofovir ranked one among these
6 compounds with minimum binding energy of -225.652
kcal/mol and four hydrogen bonds Table 2 (see
supplementary material). ADME-Toxicity for the top docking
hits was predicted using ADMET descriptors of DS.
ADME/Toxicity properties for compounds ranked on the basis
of binding energies and number of hydrogen bonds were
predicted using DS toxicity prediction module Table 3 (see
supplementary material). All the phytocompounds except
ethyl brevifolincarboxylate displayed hepatotoxicity, and
nucleoside analogue tenofovir was found to be hepatotoxic in
our study. Docking results showing interaction between active
site residues of HBV-DP and ethyl brevifolincarboxylate was
depicted in Figure 3. Molecular docking studies using
Phyllanthus niruri secondary metabolites and nucleoside
analogues against the binding cavity of HBV-DP revealed that
phytochemicals are having more favorable interactions with the
target.

Conclusion
Conventional medicines that are both safe and easily affordable
have not yet been developed for the treatment of chronic
Hepatitis B. Phyllanthus niruri is a medicinal herb used in
traditional Indian medicine for the treatment of Hepatitis B.
Therefore; it is of interest to relate molecular properties to its
medicinal properties using molecular docking of the plant's
phytochemicals with HBV DNA polymerase. In the present
work we show the binding interactions of phytochemicals such
as Ethyl brevifolincarboxylate, Tenofovir, Quercetin and
Quercitrin from Phyllanthus niruri with the modeled structure
of Hepatitis B Virus DNA polymerase using CDOCKER
protocol in Discovery studio. In silico molecular docking studies
clearly demonstrated binding activity of ligands with HBV-DP
which warrants further studies for the development of potent
inhibitors in the treatment of Hepatitis B. These results clearly
indicate that the phytochemicals from Phyllanthus niruri have
similar binding sites and better interactions with Hepatitis B
Virus DNA polymerase compared to the nucleoside analogues
at present utilized for treatment. Using a combination of in silico
approaches such as homology modeling, virtual screening and
molecular docking, we successfully validated Phyllanthus niruri
phytochemicals as HBV-DP inhibitors. Hence we conclude that
secondary metabolites from Phyllanthus niruri could be
potential lead molecules against Hepatitis B which can be
further evaluated through in vivo studies.
