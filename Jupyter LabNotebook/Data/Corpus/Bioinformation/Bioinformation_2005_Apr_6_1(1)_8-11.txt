Background
Public health management requires an understanding of disease transmission, vector control and 
      disease morbidity. Bancroftian filariasis is a mosquito borne disease, infecting nearly 60 million 
      people in South East Asian countries. The annual economic loss due to filariasis in India alone is 
      U.S$ 1.5 billion.[­] The tropical and sub-tropical 
      climate facilitates the proliferation of the mosquito vector (Culex quinquefasciatus) for filariasis. 
      [–]
      The mosquito borne disease is a threat to human population despite the practice of several control strategies.
      [] Proper planning and implementation of control measures
      require adequate exploitation of the available data for disease management. Therefore, it is of interest to 
      develop prediction methods to augment existing mosquito control strategies. Murty et al. used rule-based systems 
      for rapid and accurate identification of malaria causing 54 Indian Anopheline mosquito species. [
      ] Thus, the use of prediction models in disease management has been realized. 
      [­] These tools help epidemiologists to predict the future courses of vector borne 
      diseases. Here, we derive decision rules for vector surveillance using CART (classification and regression tree).
      

Methodology
Dataset
A mosquito abundance dataset consisting of 5790 subjects or records with 15 attributes each reflecting the meteorological
      and socio-economic conditions influencing mosquito survival was used. The mosquito density was expressed in PMHD (per man 
      hour density), which is the total catch of female Culex quinquefasciatus, per hour spent for mosquito collection.
      [] 

Dataset Processing
The raw data was stored in Excel 2000 (Microsoft Corporation). The data consists of several fields describing each 
      attribute. The attributes include (1) collection date, (2) door number, (3) village name, (4) taluk name (5) district name, 
      (6) unit name, (7) family background, (8) number of children, (9) knowledge of filariasis, (10) house type (11) maximum 
      temperature, (12) minimum temperature, (13) total rainfall, (14) relative humidity, (15) wind speed and (16) mosquito density 
      (PMHD). Seven of the sixteen attributes were further used for developing association rules. These include (1) maximum 
      temperature, (2) minimum temperature, (3) total rainfall, (4) relative humidity, (5) wind speed, (6) house type and (7) 
      mosquito density. These attributes form the independent (predictor) variables. The dependent (predictive) 
      variable is month describing different seasons and climatic conditions of the region. All variables except house type 
      and month are continuous. The four house types include, (1) hut, (2) RCC (reinforced concrete cemented), (3) thatched 
      and (4) tiled.

Data formats
The raw data was stored in EXCEL and the analysis was performed using a commercial software CART (Salford systems Inc. USA). 
      Hence, the raw data was converted to a CART compatible CSV (comma delimited) format.

Data mining tool
CART version 5.0 from Salford Systems, California, USA, was used for the current analysis. 
      [] CART is a robust and powerful tree based tool for data classification.
      [] The tool is suited for the analysis of categorical (classification) 
      and continuous (regression) datasets. The tool uses binary recursive partitioning, in which the parent nodes are exactly 
      split into two child nodes in a recursive manner until the tree is terminated. This depends on the rules used for splitting
      each node in a tree until the tree is complete. In this process, each terminal node is assigned to a class outcome. CART 
      contains sound statistical tool that enables the development of fast and accurate models. The steps used in the analyses 
      are summarized as follow. The CSV formatted data is loaded to CART using the user interface. The loaded data is used to select 
      and define independent variables (predictor) and predictive (dependent) variables. In this analysis, we defined month as 
      predictive and the other seven variables as predictors. The GINI splitting function is used to maximize the average purity of 
      two child nodes. [] CART contains two tree types, namely (1)
      classification and (2) regression. The predictive variable (month) is categorical in this analysis. Hence, we used 
      classification type tree model for this analysis.

Results
The CART analysis generated a decision tree with 133 terminal nodes based on the selection criteria. Every terminal node 
      represents a decision rule. Out of the 133 terminal nodes, 17 decision rules were in agreement with meteorological and 
      socio-economic parameters. The decision rules (IF ­ THEN) used in this analysis are given in . Data in  shows
      the distribution of Culex quinquefasciatus density (≤ 2.42 to 84) in PMHD unit over different months of a year. A very low 
      PMHD of ≤ 2.42 is reported for rules #3 and #5 in . These values correspond to the summer months April and May. This 
      observation corresponds to high maximum temperature (≤ 40.15 °C in April and &gt;40.15 °C in May) during these months. Thus, 
      high temperature is an influencing parameter for low PMHD in April and May. However, it is also found that the PMHD is &gt;20.75 
      in April when relative humidity (&gt;54 %) and rainfall is high (≤ 142 mm). Interestingly, PMHD is significantly high during 
      the monsoon and post monsoon months (June, August, September, October, November, December, January and February).

Discussion
The disease transmission dynamics is modeled using the parameters such as vector (pathogen transmitting agent) surveillance, 
      parasitic load in the human community and sudden environmental changes. []
      We used data mining tools in CART to find relationships between vector data and the predictive variable. These relations are 
      generally hidden in a large dataset. The&lt;IF-THEN&gt; rules in the CART system is used for the prediction of filarial transmission 
      vectors in an effective way.

The PMHD recorded during the summer months for rules #3 and #5 show that there is no risk of filariasis when the role of
      other influencing parameters is negligible. In , for rule #4, the PMHD is high due to high relative humidity and 
      total rainfall. This results in an increased risk of disease transmission under these conditions in April. During the months 
      of October, November and December, a high PMHD (&gt;29.2 to &lt; =84) is recorded for different house types (rules #11, #13, #14, 
      #15 and #16). These rules suggest that the relative humidity is a critical variable on vector density. For rules #1, #2, #7 
      and #17, the PMHD is elevated due to high total rainfall.  shows that the four predictors, namely, (1) total rainfall,
      (2) maximum temperature, (3) minimum temperature, (4) relative humidity and (5) wind speed influenced the target variable 
      in descending order. This is helpful in ranking the predictive variables. Thus, decision trees play an important role in 
      the management of vector borne diseases.

Conclusion
The principal vector for bancroftian filariasis is the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Surveillance of the filariasis 
      vector is an important issue in disease management. Here, we show that decision rules help to predict and forecast mosquito 
      density during different months of a year in the region. Thus, prediction of vector density is important towards the
      effective control of vector borne diseases.
