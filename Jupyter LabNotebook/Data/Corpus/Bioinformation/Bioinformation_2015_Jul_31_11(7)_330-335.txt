to the formation of indolyl-3-acetic acid. It catalyzes a unique reaction: formation of a carbon-nitrogen triple bond and dehydration
of indolyl-3-acetaldoxime. Homology model of this 57 kDa polypeptide revealed that the heme existed between H-helix and J- helix
in the hydrophobic pocket, although both helixes are involved in catalytic activity, where Gly305 and Thr308, 311 of H- helix were
involved in its stabilization. The substrate indole-3-acetaldoxime was tightly fitted into the substrate pocket with the aromatic ring
being surrounded by amino acid residues creating a hydrophobic environment. The smaller size of the substrate binding pocket in
cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 was due to the bulkiness of the two amino acid residues Phe182 and Trp315 pointing into the
substrate binding cavity. The apparent role of the heme in cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 was to tether the substrate in the catalysis
by indole-3-acetaldoxime dehydratase. Since the crystal structure of cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 has not yet been solved, the
modeled structure revealed mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis.

Cytochrome P450 CYP71A13indolyl-3-acetic acid and homology model

   
Background
Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is the main endogenous auxin in
higher plants which plays role in plant growth including
initiation and emergence of lateral roots, patterning of the root
apical meristem, gravitropism, root elongation and
development [1–4]. 
Plants and some plant pathogens can
produce IAA to modulate plant growth. Plants can produce
IAA from both Trp-dependent and Trp-independent pathways
[5–6]. 
In Trp-dependent pathway, cytochromes CYP79B2 and
CYP79B3 of Arabidopsis have been shown to metabolize
tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime (Figure 1) which is a
precursor for the production of indole-3-acetonitrile in IAA
synthesis as well as the precursor for the thiohydroximates in
glucosinolate biosynthesis [7–
9]. Cytochrome P450 CYP71A13
is involved in the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime to
indole-3-acetonitrile which is subsequently converted to IAA
by nitrilases [10,
11–29]. 
Cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 is a heme
protein with protoheme as the prosthetic group to catalyze a
unique reaction: formation of a carbon-nitrogen triple bond
and dehydration of indolyl-3-acetaldoxime. Therefore, it is of
interest to analyze the predicted structural model of
cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 from Arabidopsis lyrata for
further docking procedures with suitable ligands.

Methodology
Amino acid sequence analysis, template searching and sequence alignment:
Amino acid sequences of all known cytochrome P450
CYP71A13 was retrieved from Expert Protein Analysis System
(http://www.expasy.ch) i.e. the proteomic server of Swiss
Institute of Bioinformatics [12] and retrieved amino acid
sequences were aligned using multiple alignment fast fourier
transform (MAFFT version 6). A protein BLAST search was
performed against PDB (Protein Databank) to retrieve the
corresponding template for the enzyme [13]. A BLAST search
of the Protein Databank demonstrated strongest similarity
with human cytochrome P450 PDB code 3QM4 [14]. This
similar protein was used as template for modeling, after
alignment with the MAFFT program [15]

Homology modeling:
The model building of cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 using
human cytochrome P450 (PDB code 3QM4) was achieved
using MODELLER 9.11 program [16,
17]. The model was built
including the coordinates of heme group from 3QM4 during
the modeling. The energy of the model was optimized by
several rounds of energy minimizations with Swiss-PdbViewer
[18], monitored manually to avoid major rearrangements of the
structure. Bond lengths and angles were verified and
optimized by consultation of Ramachandran maps followed by
energy minimizations.

Physiochemical properties analysis:
Different physiochemical properties of human cytochrome
P450 [14], cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 of A. lyrata 
[19] and
cytochrome P450 CYP71E1 of Sorgum vulgare [20] were
predicted Table 1 (see supplementary material) using
proteomic server ProtParam [21]. The pI was predicted using
pK values of amino acids described in Bjellqvist method 
[22]
and molecular weight was calculated by the addition of
average isotopic masses of amino acids in the protein and the
average isotopic mass of one water molecule. The extinction
coefficient of cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 and human
cytochrome P450 was calculated using the Edelhoch method
[23] and 
aliphatic index was calculated according to Ikai [24]
method. The GRAVY value was calculated [21] displaying the
hydropathicity of a protein.

Substrate docking:
Three dimensional structure of indolyl-3-acetaldoxime was
prepared using ProDrg server [25] and docked in the model of
cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 using the Autodock 4.1 program
[26,
27] which uses a genetic algorithm as a global optimizer
combined with energy minimization as a local search method.
The active site was defined as a collection of amino acid
residues enclosed within a sphere of 5 Å (1 Å=0.1 nm) radius
centered on the catalytic triad of Arg84, His233 and Ser127.
Autotors program of Autodock was used to define torsional
degrees of freedom in the ligand. The minimization was
achieved using Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA). The grid
size was set to 40 × 46 × 40 points, centered on the heme in the
crystal structure of the complex. Each docking run consisted of
100 independent docks with 1000 iteration cycles. A random
start was used to generate the substrate position within the
docking box. The substrate orientation giving the lowest
interaction energy was chosen for additional rounds of
docking.

Results &amp; discussion
The alignment used for building the homology model is shown
in Figure 2 the amino acid sequence identity of cytochrome
P450 CYP71A13 was 27% to 3QM4. Based on sequence
alignment as an input, the MODELLER 9.11 software
generated a large number of spatial restraints from the
template structure and constructed a molecular model of
cytochrome P450 CYP71A13. The possible applications of
generated model depend mainly on the quality of the obtained
model. The quality of generated model of cytochrome P450
CYP71A13 was evaluated by PROCHECK [28] which indicated
that more than 98.5% of residues Φ-ψ angles were in favoured
and additional allowed region of Ramachandran plot 
(Figure 3). Again it indicated that the finally obtained 3D model of
cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 was satisfactory with respect to
Ramachandran plot where only two residues were in
disallowed region and four (1.0%) were in generously allowed
regions. Residues located in unfavourable region were far from
substrate binding domain indicating that these residues may
not affect the ligand protein binding simulation. Analysis of
physiochemical properties revealed that cytochrome P450
CYP71A13 had higher content of negatively and positively
charged amino acids (62, 69 respectively) resulting in increased
hydrophilic character Table 1 (see supplementary material).
The values of pI showed that plant cytochrome P450
CYP71A13 and cytochrome P450 CYP71E1 was stable at higher
pH as compared to human cytochrome P450. The final models
of cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 contained α+β structure
consisting of ten major α-helices that form the conserved 3D
fold of CYP proteins and seven β- sheets (Figure 4). The heme
existed between H-helix and J- helix in the hydrophobic pocket
where Gly305 and Thr308, 311 of H- helix were involved in its
stabilization (Figure 5D). Analysis of the surface of the
structural model of cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 identified
surface exposed hydrophilic domains in the region positioned
near the N-terminal region while a hydrophobic core was
present near the C-terminal region (Figure 5A). The
hydrophobic core was formed by Leu218, 370, 364, 452,
Phe438, Pro446, Ile448 and Ala451 amino acids near the Cterminal
region. This region seemed to be most likely the
binding site for substrate.

Cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 converts indole-3-acetaldoxime
to indole-3-acetonitrile. The substrate indole-3-acetaldoxime
was docked into the substrate binding pocket so that the atoms
involved in the initial dehydration reaction were positioned
above the heme. The smaller size of the substrate binding
pocket in cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 was due to the
bulkiness of the two amino acid residues Phe182 and Trp315
pointing into the substrate binding cavity. Indole group of the
oxime was positioned slightly closer to the heme iron and Oatom
towards the Ser369 and His367 respectively with a final
distance of 2.1Å and 4.3 Å (Figure 5B). The substrate indole-3-
acetaldoxime was tightly fitted into the substrate pocket with
the aromatic ring being surrounded by residues creating a
hydrophobic environment. Leu312, 370 and Pro368 from the Cterminal
were positioned favourably for interaction with the
indole group of the substrates in the proximal end of the
pocket, while Ser369 in the heme distal end of the substrate
pocket was positioned to interact with the leaving group of
indole-3-acetaldoxime (Figure 5C). The apparent role of the
heme in cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 was to tether the 
substrate in the catalysis by indole-3-acetaldoxime
dehydratase. This homology model revealed that hydrogen
bonding between the OH group of indole-3-acetaldoxime and
the side chains of Ser369 and His367 controls the specific
orientation of the heme-bound substrate suitable for the
elimination of the OH group of indole-3-acetaldoxime and that
these residues and the heme created a prefixed site for
substrate recognition and binding (Figure 5C).

Conclusion
We describe structural model of Arabidopsis lyrata
cytochrome P450 CYP71A13 involved in auxin synthesis
generated using molecular modeling techniques. The model
was further docked with indole-3-acetaldoxime to explore
structural features and binding mechanism. Analysis of active
site and binding specificities of indole-3 acetaldoxime to the
enzyme show two amino acid residues (His367 and Ser369) for
catalytic activity and substrate binding. The model complex
provide insights for the understanding of mechanism of
substrate recognition and its conversion to corresponding
nitrile by cytochrome P450 CYP71A31.

Figure 1 Biosynthesis of auxin and related indolic compounds.
In Arabidopsis tryptophan is converted to indole-3-
acetaldoxime a precursor of auxin and indole glucosinolates by
CYP79B2 and CYP79B3. Indole-3-acetaldoxime is also an
intermediate of other phytoalexins cyclobrassinin, brassilexin
and spirobrassinin in related cruciferous plants (29). In the
biosynthesis of auxin, indole-3-acetaldoxime is dehydrated to
indole-3-acetonitrile by CYP71A13, which is then hydrolysed to
auxin by nitrilase.
