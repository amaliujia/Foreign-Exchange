Background
Wheat is the most important staple diet all over the world. It is
internationally an important commodity for marketing.
According to Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, its
contribution to GDP is 3.0 % and it is cultivated at greater area
of the country. Pakistan and India contribute 20% in annual
world wheat production. Its contribution in value added in
agriculture is 14.4%. In Pakistan, wheat is contained in large
agro ecological area []. During last decade, one reason for low
yield of wheat in Pakistan is due to the diseases of rust. Rusts
are known to be most harmful and epidemically spread
diseases of wheat. The genus of wheat rust pathogens is
puccinia. There are three types of rust (1) leaf rust (2) stem rust
and (3) stripe rust. The losses occurring because of each type
vary from each other. The characterization of wheat rust
resistance genes is necessary to control the disease so that we
could incorporate these genes into the germplasm of elite
varieties []. Crops have been improved conventionally by
selecting noticeable phenotypes showing the cumulative effect
of all genes and environment. Nowadays, plant breeding has
been updated by molecular marker technologies. Molecular
markers brought forward efficient methods of plant breeding.
Methods application and automation of analysis demand the
need to reduce the cost of large quantity of materials that are
handled by molecular markers sufficiently []. Rusts are widely
spread among continents by wind and act with rust resistance
gene by gene-for-gene manner to induce production instability.
Many new races of leaf, stripe and stem resistance have been
known to evolve and showed threat for available rust resistance
genes. More efficient wheat cultivars for rust resistance should
be developed for production enhancement. Genetic markers
and virulence characters have been utilized for rust migration
patterns []. Various studies on wheat have been carried out
using molecular marker system to characterize gene of choice,
mapping of qualitative trait loci and genetic diversity analysis.
This allows the marker assisted selection to occur. The present
study was performed with the purpose of characterizing rust
resistance genes in the wheat genotypes using different marker
systems and phylogenetic analysis of the experimental data.

Methodology
Sample Collection:
A total of 20 genotypes of Wheat were obtained from different
research stations of Pakistan including genotypes from Thal.
Genotypes were V-4189, LASANI, V-4188, V-4022, AARI-10,
AS-02, Inqlab-91, Sehar, UQAB, Pasban-90, TW-76001, TW-
76002, TW-76003, TW-76004, TW-76005, Parwaz-94, TW-76007,
TW-76008, TW-76009 and TW-760010.

DNA Isolation:
For each genotype, genomic DNA was isolated by a modified
Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) method 
[].
Then, DNA quality was determined using 0.8 % (w/v) agarose
gel and DNA quantification was performed using NanoDrop-
1000 version 3.3.1 spectrophotometer.

PCR-Marker Assay:
PCR reaction mixture reagents were 10XPCR Buffer (MgCl2+
(NH4)2SO4) in 1.5 to 2.0 µl , 50mM MgCl2 in 0.75 to 1.50µl,
(1.5+1.5) µl of each Primer (Forward+Reverse) in concentration
of 15ng /µl, 2.0 to 5.0 µl of genomic DNA (30ng /µl), 3.0 µl of
0.2Mm of total dNTPS, 0.2-0.6 µl Taq DNA polymerase in the
concentration of 5unit /µl and final volume of 16-21µl was
made by adding deionized double distilled water in 5.6 to 9.5 µl
quantity. Reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (USA).
Polymerase chain reaction was performed using the Eppendorf
Mastercycler, Germany. Mastercycler was programmed for:
initial denaturation at 940C for 5-7 min, followed by 35-45 cycles
of denaturing at 940C for 30 sec-1min., annealing at 360C-600C
for 30 sec-1 min. and extension at 720C for 1 min. And then a
final extension at 720C for 7-10 min. and then hold at 200C until
the tubes were replaced. 3.0% (w/v) high resolution agarose gel
was used for amplicons characterization and polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis to separate them on molecular weight basis.
Gel was visualized under ultraviolet transilluminator and gel
pictures were obtained using GeneSnap version 7.6.03 of
Syngene gel documentation system and Gene Tool analysis
system.

Data Analysis:
The significant size of each fragment was determined using
Gene Ruler 100 bp DNA ladder plus (Fermentas, USA) as
reference. After running the gel and visualizing its picture, the
data was scored. The scoring was started from lower band
(small fragment size) and continued to upper band (large
fragment size). Present band was scored as 1 whereas absent
band was scored as 0. The number of shared amplification
products were used for investigation of genetic diversity 
[].
The binary data was entered in computer for further analysis
by NTSYS-pc version 2.2. Dendrogram was constructed by
means of Unweighted Pair Group Method of Arithmetic means
(UPGMA) using similarity coefficient and similarity matrix was
obtained to measure similarity range.

Results
In the present study genotypes collected from different
breeding stations of Pakistan were analyzed for genomic
studies of rust resistance in these genotypes using molecular
marker system. A total of 30 molecular markers were
employed. Out of which 22 markers  (see

Discussion
The objectives of the present study was to check the rust
resistance genes among wheat genotypes by using PCR-Based
DNA Markers and for assessing the genetic relationships
among these genotypes by rust resistance markers. Statistical
validation was also performed using software NTSYSPC by
constructing dendrogram and similarity matrix. Molecular
markers could provide useful clues about agronomical
important and desirable qualitative genes by identifying or
manipulating. Markers help in breeding programs by
recognizing novel alleles in different species. Genetic maps of
these markers have been proved useful for the introgression of
novel genes into elite gemplasm []. Rusts pose threat to
wheat having narrow genetic background due to the lack of
resistance against evolving races of pathogen. It is necessary to
develop new techniques for incorporating efficient resistance in
wheat germplasm to avoid epidemics induced by plant
pathogens. Cultivars containing better characteristics have been
largely in use to stabilize wheat production. In wheat, it is
known that specific gene combinations provide durable and
improved resistance than using single gene because single
specific gene might become susceptible to genetic shift. Genetic
markers like STS (Sequence tagged site), RAPD (Randomly
amplified polymorphic DNA), SSR (Simple sequence repeats)
and others have been proved useful for identifying resistance
among different genotypes. Various researchers have utilized
these markers for the investigation of wheat cultivars for
different traits []. 
45 stem rust resistance (Sr) markers (genes),
18 yellow rust resistance (Yr) genes (markers) [] and nearly
58 leaf rust resistance markers have been recognized for
different races of the pathogen. Leaf rust resistance genes were
named as Lr1 through Lr58 and mostly varieties consist of
some Lr genes []. Microsatellite gwm 60 was the only marker
that co-segregated completely linked to Lr47.Lr47 is located
within an interstitial segment of Triticum speltoides Taush. 7S
chromosome translocated to the short arm of chromosome 7A
of bread wheat. Lr47 has been characterized using related
primers and gene amplification indicated the leaf rust
resistance comparing with already reported work []. The size
of the band corresponds to Lr47 was 380-450 bp. All the
genotypes possessed 380-450 bp size of band thought to be
resistant against leaf rust whereas Inqlab-91 which lack 380-450
bp of band which are susceptible to leaf rust carry no Lr47
gene. Flanking microsatellite markers were identified and one
tightly linked marker (gwm533) was shown to be associated
with presence of Sr2. All the amplification products show the
bands with the fragment size 316 bp. Genotypes like V-4189,
TW-76001, TW-76003, TW-76004, TW-76005 and TW-76009 do
not possess the Sr2 gene. The amplified fragments
corresponded to stripe rust resistance gene Yr26 and the results
were compared with the previous work which has been done
by []. This yellow rust resistance gene was considered to be
Yr26 originally thought to be also located in chromosome arm
1BS linked to marker loci Xgwm273 and Xgwm11 with genetic
distances ranging from 1.075cM to 2.74cM in both combinations
studied. Xgwm11 is also linked with Yr15.The size of the bands
corresponds to Yr15 and Yr26 was 213 bp. It is not present in V-
4189, LASANI, V-4022, AARI-02, Inqlab-91, TW-76005 and in
TW-76008 genotypes. Among 20 genotypes that used for
molecular characterization of wheat genotypes for rust
resistance genes with the application of genetic analysis
software only TW-760010 genotype that has maximum no of
genes (23). Whereas TW-76005 genotype that has minimum no
of genes (14). Research was performed on improved varieties
and advance varieties, known as genotypes. Varieties are very
important in general cultivation in the fields. Varieties are
source of resistance and used as a parent in breeding. Eight
Varieties like LASANI, AARI-10, AS-02, Sehar, Pasban-90,
Parwaz-94, Inqlab-91 and UQAB are involved in this research
work. Pasban-90, Parwaz-94 and UQAB varieties were also
used in the work which was done by []. LASANI possess the
genes like that. The present study performed to characterize
genes for rust resistance and this investigation could be helpful
in predicting the occurrence of rust disease according to
changing virulence of pathogen. Single gene could be enough
for newly evolved races of pathogen but varieties containing
efficient resistance are used economically and generally to
avoid production instability []. It is necessary for plant
breeders to choose suitable rust resistance gene or combination
of these genes for avoiding rust attacks [].

The present study offers a way of making the breeding process
simpler and rust resistance more long lasting. And it provides
an insight to the rust resistance genes that should facilitate
efficient utilization and management of genetic stocks. It allows
plant breeders to better understand the rust resistance diseases
among wheat genotypes in a more systematic fashion, and to
develop strategies to incorporate rust resistance genes in their
breeding programs to protect crop stability. There is an urgent
need to incorporate several resistance genes against major
diseases into the new wheat cultivars. Marker assisted selection
along with precise artificial field tests provide new and efficient
possibilities for geneticists and breeders to achieve these goals.

Conclusion
The data obtained in this experiment will help in accelerating
the breeding program in future, including pyramiding of
different wheat resistant genes in wheat varieties and in gene
stacking that is beneficial for improving the plant's immune
response by having multiple lines of defence for different
strains of rust.
