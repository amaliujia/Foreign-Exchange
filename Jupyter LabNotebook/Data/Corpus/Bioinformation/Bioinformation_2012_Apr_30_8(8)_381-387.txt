Background
Tuberculosis is a common and often a deadly infectious disease
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv claiming more lives
each year than any other bacterial disease. Despite the
availability of effective direct observed treatment or shortcourse
chemotherapy (DOTS) and Bacille Calmette-Guerin
(BCG) vaccine, the tubercle bacillus continues to claim more
lives than any single effective agent []. Due to the extensive
period of treatment, patients fail to complete the therapy
leading to the emergence of drug resistance-multidrug
resistance (MDR) and extensive drug resistance (XDR) in
tuberculosis. The widespread emergences of drug resistant
strains together with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
have been witnessed in the increased incidence of tuberculosis
in both developing and industrialized countries []. It has been
estimated that tuberculosis accounts for around 32 per cent
deaths in HIV infected individuals []. The recent rise in
tuberculosis cases and especially the increase in number of drug
resistant mycobacteria strains indicate an urgent need to
develop new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The quinolones are a
group of a wide range of synthetic antibiotics derived from
nalidixic acid. They are characterized by an atom of fluorine
and an aryl substituent at position 6 and 7 respectively and are
known to exhibit an antibacterial spectrum including
Mycobacterium tuberculosis []. When using fluroquinolones for
the treatment of tuberculosis, individual susceptibility,
pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles should be carefully
considered [].

The present study is aimed to understand the structure activity
of the available fluroquinolones and to obtain the predictive
quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models. A
stochastic search method such as multiple regressions (MR),
partial least square regression (PLSR), principal component
regression (PCR) and an artificial neural network (kNN-MFA)
[–] was developed to provide an insight to the various
interactive fields of different compounds in concord with the in
vitro experimental data. Different QSAR approaches have been
developed through the years and the rapid increase in threedimensional
(3D) structure of the biological molecules have led
to the development of 3D structural descriptors and associated
3D QSAR methods []. The generated models could provide a
valuable reference in the design of pharmaceuticals with
improved anti-tubercular activity.

Methodology
3D QSAR study of the molecules was performed using VLife
Molecular Design Suite [] allowing users to choose the probe,
grid size, grid interval and other parameters for generation of
descriptors.

Dataset for 3D QSAR:
Depending on the antibacterial activity and the toxicity to
humans, anti-tuberculosis drugs are classified into first-line
drugs as the first choice of treatment in new cases of TB and
second-line drugs for treatment of patients with M. tuberculosis
resistant to the first-line drugs and these were considered for
QSAR. The chemical structures of the molecules were retrieved
from Pubchem compound database at National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) []. Activity of the drugs
was taken from reported work given as MIC values [,
]. The
biological activity (IC50) of the molecules were converted to
their corresponding pIC50 values 
 (see supplementary
material) and used as dependent variables in the QSAR
calculations. The molecules were first optimized to their lowest
energy state using Merck molecular force field (MMFF) method
[] 
with RMS gradient of 0.001 and alignment was done based
on a template structure. Alignment of the molecules is one of
the most important factors in obtaining a reliable model.

Calculation of descriptors and data selection:
The aligned molecules were selected for calculation of the
descriptors after inserting the biological activity as a dependent
variable. The field descriptors were calculated with cutoffs of
10kcal/mol for electrostatic and 30kcal/mol for steric at lattice
points of the grid using a methyl probe of charge +1. A grid was
generated with grid interval of 2Å in a 3-dimensional lattice
around the aligned molecules. The dielectric constant was set to
1.0 and with suitable charge type []. Invariable columns not
contributing to the QSAR were removed. Biological activity was
selected as a dependent variable and the descriptors generated
were selected as indepenedent variables. The training and test
sets were generated using the sphere exclusion method which
allows construction of the training set covering all the
descriptor space areas occupied by representative points 
[]
and the dissimilarity values was set to 15.75. The unicolumn
statistics of the training and test sets was calculated for the
correct selection of the training and test sets.

Variable selection and model building:
The aligned molecules were subjected to regression analysis
using multiple regressions (MR) which estimates the value of
regression coefficient by applying least square curve fitting
model, partial least square regression (PLSR), an extension of
MR model without imposing any restrictions. Principal
component regression (PCR) selects a new set of axis such that
for the first set of axis it reflects most of the variations within
the data and k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) molecular field analysis
(MFA) as building methods. The models were developed using
stepwise (forward-backward) variable selection method with
cross-correlation limit set to 0.5 with the term selection criteria
as r2 for MR, PLSR and PCR and q2 for kNN-MFA. F-test ‘in’
was set 4.0 and f-test ‘out’ was set to 3.99 and scaling to
autoscaling. KNN-MFA parameter setting was within the range
of 2-5 and the distance-based weighted average prediction
method was selected for the study.

Discussion
The fluroquinolones which show activity against tuberculosis
taken for study were optimized to their lowest energy state and
aligned with a template. Of the 33 fluroquinolones considered,
14 quinolones did not align with the template and therefore
were not considered for further study. The fluroquinolones
aligned to the template () were considered for QSAR
studies. The training and test set selected by sphere exclusion
method show that the maximum of the test is less than
maximum of training and minimum of test is greater than
minimum of training set  (see supplementary material)
indicating that the test is interpolative and derived within the
min-max range of the training set. The mean of the training is
higher than the mean of test set showing the presence of
relatively less active molecules compared to the active ones.
Also, a relatively higher standard deviation in the training set
indicates that the training set has a widely distributed activity
as compared to the test set. The 3D QSAR study of the
fluroquinolones through MR, PLSR, PCR and kNN-MFA
analysis using VLifeMDS resulted in the following statistical
model. The statistical model (Model 1) shows a significant
activity-descriptors relationship accuracy of 95% (r2= 0.9507)
representing part of variation in the observed data, an activity
prediction accuracy of 90% (q2= 0.9097) and a decrease in the
predictivity for the external test set of about 0.017% (pred_r2=-
1.7535).

Model 1 (MR):
Log p (IC50) = -17.2439*S_1379 – 0.0210*S_588 +14.7252*S_498 –
0.6401
n = 13, Degree of freedom = 9, r2 = 0.9507, q2 = 0.9097, F test =
57.8086, r2 se = 0.1606, q2 se = 0.2172, pred_r2 = -1.7535,
pred_r2se = 0.6996

The same data was subjected to PLSR method which results in a
correlation of 95% (r2= 0.9498) and a low prediction accuracy of
89% (q2= 0.8976) with a decrease in external predictivity
(pred_r2=-1.7493). S_1379 and S_558 contribute negatively and
S_498 contributes positively in both MR and PLSR, thus groups
should be altered around the points to reduce the interactions.

Model 2 (PLSR):
Log p (IC50) = -16.7654*S_1379 -0.02195*S_558 + 15.61775*S_498;
Optimum Components = 2, n = 13, Degree of freedom = 10, r2 =
0.9498, q2 = 0.8976, F test = 94.6739, r2 se = 0.1536, q2 se =
0.2194, pred_r2 = -1.7493, pred_r2se = 0.6991

To improve the external predictivity of the model, PCR analysis
was performed with the same set of data resulting in a
regression coefficient of 97% (r2=0.9700) with an internal
predictive accuracy of 86% (q2=0.8636) and a decrease of the
external predictivity (pred_r2 = -1.8522). S_1379 contributes
negatively and S_560 and S_618 contribute positively to the
activity.

Model 3 (PCR):
Logp (IC50) = -13.1600*S_1379 + 12.7354*S_560 + 6.8894*S_618 +
0.1260; Optimum Components = 2, n = 13, Degree of freedom =
10, r2 = 0.9700, q2 = 0.8636, F test = 161.7857, r2 se = 0.1188, q2
se = 0.2533, pred_r2 = -1.8522, pred_r2se = 0.7120

To further improve the external predictivity of the model, kNNMFA
analysis of the fluroquinolone groups was performed and
found to be statistically significant in terms of the external
predictivity of the test with an internal predictivity of 33% (q2=
0.3290) measuring the reliability of the prediction to be reliable
and accurate. The pred_r2 obtained for the test set showed a
decreased but an improved result of the external predictivity of
pred_r2=-0.4644. Descriptor S_242 contributing to the activity
negatively indicates that a negative steric potential would
favour for the increase activity.

Model 4 (kNN-MFA):
S_242 (-0.0019 to -0.0016), k Nearest Neighbour= 2, n = 13,
Degree of freedom = 11, q2 = 0.3290, q2_se = 0.5129, Predr2 = -
0.4644, pred_r2se = 0.5102.

The PCR contour plots () showed the relative position
and range of the corresponding important steric field in the
model. The experimental and predicted activity of the model is
shown as the fitness plot () for PCR. The nearness of the
predicted to the observed activity is reported in 
 (see
supplementary material). The models obtained for QSAR
showed that the steric interactions play an important role in
determining the biological activity of the models (). The
negative range in the steric descriptors indicates that the
negative steric potential is favourable for the increase in the
activity and a less bulky substituent group is favored in the
region.

Conclusion
The present study was aimed at deriving the predictive 3D
QSAR models capable of revealing the structural requirement
for anti-tuberculosis inhibitors. Comparison of the different
statistical parameters of the four models suggests model 1 for
further consideration having a better internal predictivity of q2=
0.9097 and an external test of pred_r2= -1.7535. Model 4 (kNNMFA)
though has a bad internal predictivity of q2 = 0.3290, the
external predictivity (pred_ r2=-0.4644) of the test is better as
compared to the other models. The models show that steric
effects dominantly determine the binding affinities indicating
both a positive and a negative contribution suggesting a more
bulky group is favored in the region where there is positive
contribution and a less bulky group is favourable in the region
with negative contribution. Modification of these regions will
lead to better and improved compounds for the treatment of
tuberculosis. The MR and kNN-MFA models developed show
potential predictive ability as determined by testing the external
test set. The QSAR models may lead to a better understanding
of the structural requirements of anti-tuberculosis compounds
and also help in designing of novel molecules.
