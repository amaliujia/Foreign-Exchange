Background
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is an epidemic
worldwide serious health disease. Currently, a highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which consists of drugs
targeting reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR) enzymes,
is used for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. However, the
limitation of RT and PR inhibitors in terms of side effects and
drug resistance leads to an effort to develop new drugs to be a
third component of HAART. HIV-1 integrase (IN), one of the
three important enzymes in HIV life cycle, has become an
attractive target for AIDS therapy. Due to no known similar
enzyme in human, therefore, specific HIV-1 IN inhibitor is
expected to have minimal side effects compared to other
antiviral agents. HIV-1 IN is composed of three distinct
domains, N-terminal (residues 1-50), catalytic core (residues 50-
212), and C-terminal (residues 212-288). The N-terminal domain
is involved in enzyme multimerization while the C-terminal
domain has strong but nonspecific DNA-binding activity and
thus has been called the DNA-binding domain. Catalytic
residues, Asp64, Asp116, and Glu152, are located in the central
core domain and coordinate with the divalent metal cation,
either Mg2+ or Mn2+. Although the structures of each individual
or the two fragment domains were obtained by X-ray
crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy [–], 
there is no experimentally completed
structure of HIV-1 IN. HIV-1 IN catalyzes two well
characterized reactions referred to a terminal 3'-end processing
(the cleavage of two terminal nucleotides from the 3'-ends of
viral double-stranded DNA) and a strand transfer (joining of
the processed 3'-ends of the virus to the 5'-phosphate groups in
the human chromosomal DNA). In addition, IN is capable of
catalyzing the reverse reaction referred to a disintegration
process.

A currently most promising HIV-1 IN inhibitor is the diketo
acids (DKAs) which inhibit the strand transfer reaction. The
bifunctional DKA derivatives were found to bind both the
acceptor host DNA and the viral donor DNA sites of IN and
inhibit both 3'-processing and strand transfer mechanisms 
[].
Although DKAs were found to be effective against viral
integration in infected cells, this class of inhibitors leads to
drug-induced mutations in HIV-1 IN []. Currently, raltegravir,
a strand transfer inhibitor, is the only approved IN inhibitor 
[].
However, the resistance of this commercial drug has been
reported [,
]. There are three primary mutations for
raltegravir resistance. The two primary resistance pathways
involved mutations of the amino acids at Q148 (Q148K/R/H)
or N155 (N155/H) whereas a third primary mutation pathway
at Y143 (Y143C/R) was less commonly found [,
]. The
secondary mutation at position G140 (G140S) combined with
primary mutation Q148K/R/H significantly enhanced drug
resistance. Indeed, the occurrence of drug resistance is a major
reason for the failure of antiretroviral therapies in HIV-1
infection [,
]. Therefore, it is necessary to continue seeking
HIV-1 IN inhibitors with high potency that are non-toxic and
inhibit drug-resistant strains.

The bottleneck of structure-based design of HIV-1 IN has been
complicated due to a lack of co-crystallized structure of ligand
with isolated protein or with the DNA complex. Although the
only experimentally resolved X-ray crystal structure of the HIV-
1 IN complexed with 1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(2Htetrazol-
5-yl)-propenone (5CITEP) inhibitor was available, it
was believed that the bound conformation of ligand was
influenced by crystal packing effect []. Recently, crystal
structures of full-length IN protein from prototype foamy virus
(PFV) complexed with viral DNA and two Mg2+ ions were
solved with raltegravir []. The intasome structure provided
further an understanding of binding orientation of IN strand
transfer inhibitor. The carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of both
compounds were observed to directly chelate the catalytic metal
ions while the halobenzyl moiety displaced the reactive 3'-
hydroxy group of viral DNA end by 6 Å relative to the free
ligand bound IN active site []. The PFV IN intasome could be
considered as a model to develop HIV-1 IN strand transfer
inhibitors as suggested by the docking studies [,
] as it
could provide an understanding of the binding modes of HIV-1
IN strand transfer inhibitors. In the preset work, molecular
docking calculations were performed on the two highly potent
and non-toxic HIV-1 IN inhibitors, lithospermic acid (M522) and
lithospermic acid B (M532) extracted from the roots of the
Danshen plant Salvia miltiorrhiza 
[]. These two polyphenolic
compounds inhibited both 3΄end processing and strand transfer
with IC50 values in the range of 0.37-0.83 µM and strongly
suppressed acute HIV-1 infection in H9 cells (IC50 of 2-6.9 µM)
and were not cytotoxic at high concentrations (CC100&gt;297 µM
and 223 µM, respectively. Binding orientations and favorable
interactions of ligands against the wild-type (WT) and three
different mutation strains; Y212R (equivalent to Y143R HIV-1
IN), N224H (equivalent to N155H HIV-1 IN) and S217H
(equivalent to G140S/Q148H HIV-1 IN) of PFV IN were
predicted.

Methodology
Protein preparation:
The X-ray crystal structures of WT, N224H (corresponding to
N155H HIV-1 IN) and S217H (corresponding to G140S/Q148H
HIV-1 IN) PFV IN/DNA intasome retrieved from Protein Data
Bank with pdb code 3OYA, 3OYN, and 3OYL, respectively,
were used for docking study []. The structure corresponding
to Y143R mutation of HIV-1 IN was obtained by modifying the
WT structure of PFV IN bound to raltegravir (3OYA). Tyrosine
at position 212 was replaced by amino acid arginine. The
proteins were initially prepared by removing the coordinates of
ligand and water molecules. Hydrogen atoms were added and
the CHARMM force field was subsequently applied to optimize
the protein structure.

Ligand Preparation:
The structures of the M522 and M532 
 were built and geometry optimized at
the semi-empirical PM6 level of theory using the MOPAC2009
program [].

Molecular Docking:
Molecular docking calculations were carried out using
CDOCKER module implemented in Discovery studio 2.0 
[].
The binding pocket of the native co-crystallized ligand was
identified as the protein active site. The docking calculations
were performed using the default settings. The receptor was
held rigid while the rotatable bonds of ligand were allowed to
rotate during the calculation. Docking procedures were
validated by docking the native raltegravir into the active site of
the PFV IN and then the docked conformations were compared
to that of X-ray complex structure (see supplementary material).
Both M522 and M532 compounds were consequently docked
into the active site of WT and mutated IN intasome by using the
same procedures as raltegravir.

Discussion
Validation of Docking Protocol:
To validate the computational docking protocol, raltegravir was
extracted and docked back to its corresponding binding pocket.
The best docking pose could reproduce the optimal orientation
and position of raltegravir to be close to that of its original
orientation detected in the X-ray complex structure 

(see supplementary material).

Interaction mode with WT strain:
The calculated binding energies of both compounds are within
the same range  (see supplementary material) and
support their comparable inhibitory potency []. The binding
conformations of M522 and M532 in the binding pocket of WT
PFV IN are depicted in () while their important
interactions are given in . Both compounds shared a
similar binding pattern in which their 1st catechol moiety (R1)
chelated the two Mg2+ ions. In addition, the 2, 3-
dihydrobenzofuran ring and one of catechol moieties (R1) of the
two ligands made π-π stacking interactions with adenosine base
A17 of the viral DNA. For compound M522, the hydroxyl
oxygen atoms of both catechol moieties chelated the two metal
cations (). Due to a steric effect, the addition of a
long side chain including the 3rd catechol in compound M532,
however, led to only one catechol ring (R1) interacting with the
Mg2+ ions (). The 2nd catechol ring (R2) of the
M522 formed edge to face hydrophobic interaction with Phe190
while the six membered rings of the 2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran
core structure made the hydrophobic π-π interaction with
Tyr212. There was no hydrogen bond formation between IN
and M522. However, this is different in the case of M532 where
hydrogen bonds were found to stabilize the protein-ligand
complex. One of the hydroxyl oxygen of the 2nd catechol ring
(R2) of M532 established hydrogen-bonding interaction with the
backbone nitrogen of Ala188. In addition to π-π interaction with
Tyr212, the 3rd catehol moiety (R3) created hydrogen bonds with
backbone nitrogen atoms of Tyr212 and His213 and carbonyl
oxygen of Thr210. The addition of the 3rd catechol moiety could
possibly improve the binding affinity of M532 against the WT
IN through a large number of hydrogen bonding interactions.

Interaction mode with the single mutation strain:
The hypothetically predicted mode of action of these two
compounds against the Y212R (corresponding to Y143R HIV-1
IN) and N224H (corresponding to N155H HIV-1 IN) PFV IN are
displayed in (), respectively. Although the two
compounds showed different modes of binding from those of
WT complex, their binding energies were do not significantly
changed () except for N224H-M522 system. The
proposed raltegravir resistance pathway of the less frequently
Y143H/R/C has been directly related to the interaction
between inhibitor and Tyr143. In the WT structure, the side
chain of Tyr143 was found to form a direct π-π stacking
interaction with oxadiazole ring of raltegravir, however, the
replacement of Tyr by Arg (Y143R) disturbs this type of
interaction, thereby could possible significantly influence drug
inhibitory potency [,
]. However, from our docking
calculation, although the mutation of Y212R was observed to
destroy the π-π stacking interaction between protein and ligand,
other types of interaction i.e. cation-π and hydrogen bond were
alternatively occurred between Arg212 and M522 and M532,
respectively (). Hence, mutation of this particular
residue may not significantly result in susceptibility of these
compounds. The docking results of the N224H mutant revealed
that the bound conformations of both M522 and M532 were also
different from those of WT complex. The two compounds
displayed similar binding pattern in which their 2, 3-
dihydrobenzofuran framework pointed toward to the two
divalent metal ions although their 1st catechol ring was flipped
in the opposite direction (). The more stable binding
interaction energy of M532 (-75.01 kcal/mol) compared to M522
(-54.58 kcal/mol) could possibly due to the stronger metalligand
and hydrogen bonding interactions than that of M522
system. The M532 established hydrogen bonds with Tyr212,
Val327, and A17 of viral DNA while this type of interaction was
detected with only Gln186 in the case of M522. Our docking
analysis suggested that M532 might be active against the
mutation of N224H IN (corresponding to N155H HIV-1 IN).

Interaction mode with the double mutation strain:
The predicted binding modes of both M522 and M532 with the
S209/S217H mutant (equivalent to G140S/Q148H HIV-1 IN)
are displayed in . Due to steric constraint of
imidazole side chain of His, the mutation of S217H leads to
inhibitor binding in another region that is different from those
of WT and the other two mutant systems. Interestingly,
although the binding of M522 and M532 was disturbed, they still
preserved the metal-ligand chelation and some key interactions
with the surrounding residues. Moreover, the two compounds
shared somewhat similar modes of binding and action in which
their carboxylic acid chelated the Mg2+ ions. The catechol
moiety of both M522 and M532 interacted with viral DNA via
hydrogen bond interaction with the phosphate group of A17. In
addition to the carboxylic acid, the hydroxyl moiety of the 1st
catechol ring of M532 was also capable to chelate one of the
metal ions ( &amp; 
) while the M522 did not
(). Again, the more stable binding interaction
energy of M532 (-75.70 kcal/mol) compared to M522 (-60.97
kcal/mol) might possibly because of its stronger hydrogen
bonding interactions. The M532 made hydrogen bonds with
Tyr129, Gly131, Gln186, Ala188, Thr210, and His213 while
hydrogen bonds between M522 and Tyr212 and Lys228 were
observed. The mutation strain of G140S/Q148H in HIV-1 IN
has &gt; 150-fold reduced susceptibility to raltegravir 
[,
].
From our docking calculation, raltegravir lost interactions to
protein; catalytic metal ion and viral DNA (see  in
supplementary material). This is different in the case of M522
and M532, Although the mutation of S217H (corresponding to
G140S/Q148H of HIV-1 IN) disturbed the inhibitor binding
mode, it is likely that both compounds were capable to preserve
the main interactions with Mg2+ ions, the contacting amino
acids and viral DNA. Their interaction energies were also more
stable than that of raltegravir. Therefore, this mutation variant
probably has relatively no influence on the key interactions
between IN and both molecules in particular M532 since it could
form many hydrogen bonds with the nearby amino acids.

Conclusion
In the present work, molecular docking studies were conducted
to determine the binding conformations of M522 and M532,
natural compounds extracted from the Plant Salvia Miltiorrhiza,
within the catalytic site of WT and mutation variants of PFV IN.
In the WT system, the binding energies of M522 and M532
compounds were found to correspond to their comparable
inhibitory potency. The most favorable finding bound
conformations of these molecules directly chelated with the
Mg2+ ions. The presence of hydrogen bonding, metal-ligand,
and π-π stacking interactions plays a major role in the
stabilization of the binding preference between protein and
ligand. For the mutation strains, almost major interactions
between ligand and amino acids of IN were fairly preserved.
This study could highlight the application of M522 and M532 as
candidate IN inhibitors for drug development against drug
resistant strains. Development of M522 and M532 as new
mutation insensitive HIV drugs for AIDS patients are currently
in progress.
