System in Human. This is differentially expressed during serological studies in inflamed condition such as Rheumatoid Arthritis
(RA). Therefore, it is of interest to glean molecular insight using a model of GFAP (49.88 kDa) due to its crystallographic nonavailability.
The present study has been taken into consideration to construct computational protein model using Modeller 9.11.
The structural relevance of the protein was verified using Gromacs 4.5 followed by validation through PROCHECK, Verify 3D,
WHAT-IF, ERRAT and PROVE for reliability. The constructed three dimensional (3D) model of GFAP protein had been scrutinized
to reveal the associated functions by identifying ligand binding sites and active sites. Molecular level interaction study revealed
five possible surface cavities as active sites. The model finds application in further computational analysis towards drug discovery
in order to minimize the effect of inflammation.

Background
Glial Fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate
filament protein having molecular weight 49.88 kDa and is
found to be present in the glial cells of the Central Nervous
System (CNS) [1]. It was first isolated from human multiple
sclerosis plaques in 1971 [2]. This protein is used as a classical
marker for astrocytes in the vertebral central nervous system 
[3]
and it plays role in the de-differentiation of the axon and
maintaining the strength of the astrocytes [4]. In our previous
study we have identified this protein to be significantly up
regulated during the chronic inflammation of Rheumatoid
Arthritis (RA) [5]. RA is an autoimmune inflammatory disease
that affects the joints in systemic manner. In order to
understand the etiology of this disease, the understanding of
the insights of protein structure may play an important role.
But lack of crystallographic or NMR deduced model structure
of GFAP restricted the complete understanding of protein role
towards RA. To better understand the function of a protein, 3
dimensional (3D) structure of protein is needed. In case of
unavailability of experimentally determined protein structure,
we made an attempt to build a model of the protein of interest
using in-silico methods [6,
7]. From an earlier study of the
protein we came to an assured point of the rod domain of
GFAP being conserved [8]. In the present study, we generated a
model based on comparative protein modeling. The model
generated has been subjected for its Molecular Dynamic (MD)
and protein quality analysis using Gromacs 4.5. This robust
check helped us in validating the schematically prepared
protein model.

Methodology
The whole experiment had been carried out in Windows7 and
Ubuntu 10.1 Operating systems. Comparative modeling has
been carried out by Modeller 9.11 package [9] in Windows
while molecular dynamic simulation was done in Gromacs 4.5
[10] in the Ubuntu platform. The models were visualized in
Pymol, the active sites were predicted using Molegro Virtual
Docker [11].

Sequence Retrieval:
The sequence of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP),
accession no AAB22581.1 GI: 251802; of Homo sapiens was
retrieved in FASTA format from NCBI protein database.

Template Identification:
The program BLAST-P [12] has been used to detect similar
crystallographic protein structures of GFAP. The parameters set
for the search include all default and maintained the search for
highly similar sequences/structure. The BLOSUM 62 [13]
matrix was used for scoring the similarity. The better identical
sequences having low gap percentage and high identity as well
as higher number of positives, were chosen for templates. The
template structures were then downloaded from the RCSBPDB.
The identification of the templates was based on the
results of the query coverage, since there were no homologous
proteins available in the PDB database. So the templates were
selected on the basis of following criteria: 1) The proteins that
share common ancestor with GFAP; 2) Short query coverage
must have high identities; 3) Low identities must have high
positives and large query coverage. The sequences of the
chosen templates including the query were then subjected for
multiple sequence alignment and 2D secondary structure
alignment for analysis of secondary structural variation among
the proteins.

Modeling of GFAP and quality analysis studies:
Modeling was performed using Modeller 9.11. This program
models protein tertiary structure by satisfaction of spatial
restraint using standard parameters sets. The generated threedimensional
model includes all non-hydrogen main-chain and
side-chain atoms. Generated model has been refined using
energy minimization techniques to optimize stereochemistry
and to remove bumps and steric clashes among non-bonded
interactions using the commands of Modeller 9.11. Scripts
generated five default models of the protein with different
DOPE (Discrete Optimized Protein Energy) score. The model
with lowest DOPE score was selected due to less steric clashes.
This model is further refined by energy minimization by
steepest descent method by applying AMBER03 Force Field 
[14]
and solvating the protein in water. The force of 1000 kj/mol
was applied for the purpose. The process of energy
minimization was carried out using GROMACS 4.5 [15] for 5
nano second for observing the stability, computing the velocity
temperature coupling and relaxing the system by pressure
temperature coupling. The protein behavior was measured by
evaluating Root mean square deviation (RMSD), Root mean
square fluctuation (RMSF), and Radius of gyration (Rg). RMSD
is the measure of query structure deviation and fluctuation
from the crystal structure respectively [16]. The radius of
gyration of a protein is a measure of its compactness. If a
protein is stably folded, it is likely to maintain a relatively
steady value of Rg. If a protein unfolds, its Rg will change over
time. Final structure was validated by Ramachandran plot
using Rampage. It is an online tool which validates the dihedral
angles present among the amino acids based on the
Ramachandran plot [17].

Results &amp; discussion
In the present communication we have identified the 3D
structure of GFAP that can be used to reveal its role in
pathogenesis of RA in near future. Due to the absence of
crystallographic structure of this protein, it is necessary to
predict the 3D structure in order to understand the function of
a particular protein. In case of GFAP, there are some already
predicted structures in various servers and databases but due
to lack of complete sequence coverage we have to predict the
complete structure of this protein. Similarity search for the
template identification have been shown in Table 1 (see
supplementary material).

The search resulted that the GFAP protein sequence is similar
to vimentin, lamin, keratin 5 and keratin 14 of human and also
similar to the Staphylococcus aueris, Francisella tularensis and
Bacillus subtilis. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using
clustalW for global alignment followed by the proml of phylip
which reveals that the vimentin and GFAP were probably
sharing common ancestors. This envisages that these two
proteins probably arose from genes that are paralogous.
Although 3S4R, 3SSU, 3G1E, and 1GK7 share the common
ancestors with GFAP, but the length aligned was very poor i.e.
90, 90, 36 and 37 amino acids respectively out of 432 amino
acids. But it covers query length with maximum identity
percentage of 59%, 60%, 70% and 71% respectively. Therefore,
the query coverage of 3S4R, 3SSU, 3G1E, and 1GK7 when
aligned to GFAP sequence is 21%, 21%, 8% and 8% respectively
which is not sufficient for the purpose of modeling. Hence, 17
suitable templates for the present study have been selected
based on the previously discussed criteria (Figure 1).

Model generation:
A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) generated using a
python script ‘salign.py’. The MSA was converted into a
sequence profile that lists the likelihood of the 20 standard
amino acid residue types at every position in a given MSA.
Alignments based on sequence profiles rather than single
sequences have been shown to be significantly more accurate
[18]. 
The ‘salign’ command of salign.py generated a matrix of
pairwise alignment, as shown in the Table 2 (see
supplementary material), where the raw quality score of the
multiple alignment was found to be 17.9. Quality Score (QS) is
the average number of structurally equivalent residue pairs. It
had RMS cut-off of 1.000. Two residues are considered to be
equivalent when they have closer than RMS CUTOFF. There
were 136 number of unique protein pairs. The multiple
alignment file has been written in protein information resource
(PIR) format.

Modeller generated 5 models on the basis of DOPE score that
has been considered as the best scoring function 
[19]. The
structure showing highest stability with least score (-
27480.207031) was selected for further analysis. The model
generated may have steric hindrance or might possess sidechain
bumps that affect the backbone folding. Therefore,
stereochemistry was satisfied with energy minimization
allowing repositioning of the amino acids in the 3D space
solvating the model in water. The solvation was virtually
executed in GROMACS by generating a cubic box that places
the model at the center of the box (c) and at least 1.0 nm from
the box edge (-d 1.0). Solute box specified with distance 1.0 nm
means that there are at least 2.0 nm between periodic images of
a protein. The whole system was found to possess a net charge
of -13e. Since life does not exist at a net charge, we had to add
ions to our system. Thus 13 positive Na+ ions were added to
neutralize the system.

The energy minimization was carried out using steepest
descent method of Gromacs 4.5 package, applying Amber 03
Force Field [15] and the force applied was 1000kj/mol. This
process is converged at 2593 steps and the energy was
minimized to -3.2263365e+06. The DOPE score of this new
model was found to be -32518.039063 indicating the more stable
model compared to earlier model. The model was
superimposed to determine the structural differences using
standard method of computing which apparently resulted to be
0.817 that infer minor changes in positioning of the atoms
because of the energy minimization. An attempt was also made
to study the stability of the model in the biological
environment. The whole process was studied in three steps:

NVT (constant Number of particles, Volume, and Temperature):
The system was equilibrated in NVT ensemble (constant
Number of particles, Volume, and Temperature) where
temperature 310 K for 100-ps. The temperature coupling
algorithm used for NVT simulation was Berendsen-thermostat.
Temperature progression analysis can be depicted in graph.
From the plot (Figure 2a), it is clear that the temperature of the
system quickly reaches the target value (310 K), and remains
stable during equilibration process.

NPT (constant Number of particles, Volume, and Pressure):
The resulted final model after NVT simulation was then
subjected for NPT simulation. Equilibration of pressure is
conducted under an NPT ensemble, wherein the Number of
particles, Pressure, and Temperature are all constant. The
pressure applied for the study was 1-bar. The pressure
progression computed by Gromacs was stated as a graph plot
(Figure 2b). When this plot was analyzed we found that the
pressure value fluctuated widely over the course of 100-ps
equilibration phase. Thus, by measuring the average of the
running data we kept the pressure value as 1.05.

Production Molecular Dynamics:
It is used as a post-processing tool to strip out coordinates,
correct for periodicity, or manually alter the trajectory (time
units, frame frequency, etc) for both the least squares fit and for
RMSD calculation. The output plot shows that the RMSD
relative to the structure present in the minimized form and
system has been equilibrated. Further, we calculated RMSD
relative to the crystal structure. The report generated in both
the plots (Figure 2c) revealed that RMSD tends to levels off to
~0.8 nm (1 Å). This indicates that the structure tends to stabilize
itself in due course of time. Subtle differences between the plots
indicate that the structure at t = 0 nano second (ns) is slightly
different from this crystal structure. This is to be expected, since
it has been energy-minimized, and because the position
restraints are not completely perfect. The analysis of the Rg for
GFAP in our simulation: we can see from the reasonably
invariant Rg values that the protein remains very stable, in its
compact (folded) form over the course of 5 ns at 310 K in 1bar
pressure (Figure 2d). This result was expected, that proves the
stability of the model.

The generated models consists of 17 (seventeen) α-Helices (H),
9(nine) β-Sheets (B), 23 Loops (L) and 2(two) very short Turns
(T). The N-terminal of the protein consists of a loop of 19 amino
acids and the C-terminal is a long tail of alternate helices and
loops (Figure 3). The overall shape of the protein seems to be
‘∞’ shape. Here the helix number 7 (seven) is supposed to be
stabilizing the two parts of the protein. The movement of the
protein is supposed to be controlled by seventh, eighth, ninth
and tenth helices. The comparative visualization of the amino
acids act on each and every position of superimposed
structures was energy minimized (Figure 4) and subtle
variations are recorded during the production MD for 5ns.
These variation show that residues in alpha helices or beta
sheets have low stability to remain in the earlier stretch form.

However, Rampage gave a favorable result upon submission of
both the protein structures. Rampage results of secondary
protein models before and after molecular dynamics. The
results obtained from the initial model were 386 residues in
favoured region; 20 residues in allowed region and 24 residues
in outlier regions. In contrast, the final model consist 340
residues in favored area; 66 residues in allowed region and 23
residues at outlier region (Figure 5). It signifies that after the
first round molecular dynamic study of the model for 5ns it
tend to form a stable state with less steric hindrance compared
to the previous model. Thus, upon an increment in the
duration, the model might be able to show a permanent stable
confirmation. The probable ligand binding pockets were
predicted using Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD). There are 5
pockets on the surface of the protein (Figure 6). Residues
involved in the surface pockets have been listed in 
Table 3 (see
supplementary material). The first big obstacle to model this
protein by in-silico approach is because of its homologous
sequence with close similarity. Although it is similar to human
Vimentin and Keratin it covers only to short extent. The
instability index of such sequence is 52.74 which is too high.
The generated model has no di-sulphide bonds among any
residues. This long peptide chain contains only one cystine
residue. This molecular insight may be utilized for revealing
the role of this protein in pathogenesis of RA.

Conclusion
We report a molecular structural model of GFAP with a DOPE
score of -27518.980469. Information related to its molecular
cavity is documented that would help in further docking
studies. The molecular model was subjected to molecular
dynamics simulation over 5 ns and trajectories for its molecular
properties monitored. The trajectory files towards the end of
the time limit shows a tendency of stabilization of the plot.
Energy minimization and molecular dynamic simulation was
carried out by GROMACS. After the energy minimization,
minor changes were observed. MD simulation revealed that
protein remains stable in its folded form over the course of 5 ns
at 310 K temperature and in 1 bar pressure. These results
provide insights in understanding its molecular structural
features towards drug discovery.
