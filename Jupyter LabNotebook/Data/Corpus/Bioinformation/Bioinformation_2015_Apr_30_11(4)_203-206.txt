Background
Nowadays, fungal infections are increasing especially in
immune-deficiency patients [–
]. There is a common problem
with vaginitis [] caused almost by both Candida species and
Gardenerlla vaginalis as well as Trichomonas vaginalis, which are
responsible for 10 millions official visits in a year [–
]. The
infection of Candidal vulvovaginitis is originated from lower
genital found in 30-80 % of cases without symptoms or mild
symptoms []. Almost 70 % of women have experienced the
vulvovaginal Candidiasis at least once [–
]. About 45% of
women have suffered from 2 or more attack in a year, and
about 5% of them have suffered from chronic and recurrent
infection [–
]. The most common sign of Candidal vaginitis
is vaginal itching, dysuria and malodorous-white vaginal
secretions [,
,
]. In fact, the candidal vulvovaginitis
especially in recurrent type is a physical-mental disease which
causes a lot of stress in patients [] that is rarely a threat agent,
but it leaded to catastrophic results such as recurrent suffering,
more consumption and sterility. According to a research in U.S,
every recurrent of this disease spent 60 $ for visit and medical
treatment and a doctor spent 1-3 hours for diagnosis and
treatment []. Some important factors which cause Candidiasis
to increase are pregnancy, contraception drugs with high
estrogen, antibiotic consumptions, uncontrolled diabetes,
immuno-suppressive drugs, unsafe or excessive sexual
intercourse, chronic anemia and season allergic 
[–]. For
treating Candidal vaginitis, the most available way is using
local azol family such as clotrimazole []. The most abundant 
use of nystatin is the treatment of facial infections such as
mucosal candidiasis including vaginal or gastrointestinal
infections []. Other members of topical azol family are
butoconazole, miconazole and terconazole. The fluconazole and
ketoconazole are used orally and has the same effect 
[–].
However, resistance to azol in Candida species has been
increasing in recent years and has caused serious problems in
successful treatment of vaginitis. The resistance to azole drugs
in non-albicans species such as C. glabrata, C. parapsilopsis, C.
tropicalis , C. kruse is increasing [–
]. Regarding resistance
increase to antifungal drugs in Candida species, the present
study evaluated antifungal drug susceptibility of fungi isolated
from vaginitis of women referred to privacy clinic of Ilam city
during 2013-2014.

Methodology
Sampling and culture:
Samples were collected from 385 women with vaginitis by
obstetrician by using sterile swab after collecting, the samples
were transported to laboratory and were cultured in Sabouraud
Dextrose Agar containing chloramphenicol 0.5% and were
incubated in 37°c for 2 days. Differentiation of C.albicans and
non-albicans isolates, were carried out by germ tube test,
chlamydospores producing, growth on chrome agar and
charbohydrate absorption [].

Antifungal drug susceptibility test :
The reference MM4-A method suggested by Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) was used for antifungal
drug susceptibility test []. C. albicans and non-albicans
isolates were cultured overnight in 35°c , then a suspension
equal 0.5 McFarland was prepared, and was cultured on
Mueller Hinton agar containing 2% glucose and 0.5 mg/ml
methylene blue, by using sterile cotton swab. Antifungal drug
disks were used including nystatin 100 unit/disk, fluconazole
10µg/disk, itraconazole 10µg/disk, ketoconazole 10µg/disk,
amphotericin B 20µg/disk, clotrimazole 10µg/disk,
posaconazole 5µg/disk, and voriconazole 1µg/disk (Sigma
Aldrich, USA). The inhibition zone diameters were recorded
after 24 h and 48 hours []. The C. albicans ATCC 2091 was
used as standard strain.

Statically analysis:
All of data were analyzed by SPSS v.18, chi-square and Tstudent
test and P&lt;0.05 was considered as significant.

Results
Among 385 samples, culture of only 239 samples was positive,
and 150 isolates were C.albicans and 89 isolates were nonalbicans.
Among 385 samples, the 133 samples from urban
persons and the 225 from rural persons were collected. The 61
urban samples were C.albicans (P&lt;0.05). Eighty three women
of all patients were 25-35 years old and 22 persons were less
than 25 years old, and 45 persons were more than 35 years old,
and 32.5% of them had history of using antifungal-drug 

(see supplementary material). This study showed that the
patients who were C.albicans-positive culture, about 33 persons
had used condoms, 22 persons in normal way, 73 persons had
used high estrogen contraceptive (more than40mg/µg ) and 22
persons had used fallopian tube obstruction method and other
ways for contraception (P&lt;0.05). There was 6 illiterate persons,
26 persons with BS degree, 2 persons with MSc degree, 48 
persons with diploma degree and 68 persons with underdiploma
degree (p&lt;0.,05). In the antifungal drug susceptibility
test, resistance to 8 antifungal drugs including floconazole,
itraconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, voriconazole,
posaconazole, nystatine, amphotericin B were 76%, 62%, 72%,
55%, 6%, 7%, 1% and 0%, respectively 
 (see
supplementary material).

Discussion
Researchers are interested in antifungal drug resistance because
of increasing fungal diseases in predisposed people such as
those suffering from AIDS, diabetic persons, those who use
broad spectrum antibiotics and chemotherapy, and also,
growing drug resistance in fungi. In this study, about 150
isolates from all 239 isolates were C. albicans and 89 isolates
were non-albicans, that it showed the high prevalence role of
C.albicans in candidal vulvovaginitis []. There is a significant
relation between urban and rural disposed persons to
vulvovaginitis, and it is in accordance with Mohamadi et al;
[]. Also, the results showed the high prevalence of candidal
vulvovaginitis in 25-35 years old and it is in agreement with the
results of Gharibi et al; []. There is a significant relation
between the way of contraception and candidal vulvovaginitis
(P=0.05), that is, the most abundant pollution which had been
seen in women who used high estrogen contraceptive drugs, in
fact it occurred because of changing in hormones level and pH
level in vaginal, subsequently []. In the study of Kotarski et al;
that was done among the polish women in Art state, it showed
that candidal vulvovaginitis is the common reason for referring
to gynecological in sexual active persons , and it is in line with
our results [,
]. There is a significant relation between the
academic degree of participant and the chance of suffering from
candidal vulvovaginitis, according to the results, we can claim
that higher education has direct relation with higher level of
personal hygiene, that it was in line with Azizi et al; and 
Abdollahi et al; [,
]. In the present study, the resistance of
C.albicans isolated from vaginitis to 8 antifungal agents
indicate, the highest resistance was seen for fluconazole with
79% and the lowest was seen for nystatin and amphotericin B
with 1% and 0%, respectively. In the present study, the
resistance of nystatine and amphotericin B that they originated
from poly-N family and caspofungin from echinocandin family,
was less expected, while in the other study that performed on
the resistance of C.albicans, it was reported 3-8% 
[–]. This
result indicates the low resistance of C.albicans isolated from
Ilami patients, it may be due to useing herbal antifungal
medicine in this city []. The resistance to fluconazole with 79
% was more than the other studies [,
]. The resistance to
voriconazole and posaconazole were similar to other studies,
but there was high unexpected resistance reported about
itraconazole, ketoconazole and clotrimazole comparison
Mohamadi et al; that performed in 2014 and evaluated the
resistance of C. albicans isolated from Candidiasis suspected
neonates, this difference in results may be related to different
age groups and samples [].

Conclusion
The results of this study indicate high susceptibility to nystatin
and it is recommended to use this antifungal drug in empirical
therapy for candidial vaginitis. Regarding high resistance to
fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole, these antifungal
drugs are not recommended for treating candidial vaginitis.
