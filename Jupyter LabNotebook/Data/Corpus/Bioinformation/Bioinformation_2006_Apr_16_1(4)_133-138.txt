Background
Some proteins are highly expressed during late stage(s) of seed development and are referred to as LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins. These proteins 
			are found in a wide range of plant species and are suggested to involve in desiccation tolerance based on their accumulation and physicochemical properties. 
			[] LEA-type proteins fall into a number of families with diverse structures and functions, that 
			differ in the arrangement and number of conserved motifs. These proteins are also hydrophilic in nature, and are transcriptionally regulated in response 
			to ABA. [] Prediction of secondary structures suggests that these proteins exist as largely unfolded 
			molecules in their native state although a few members do exist as dimers or tetramers. [] The precise 
			function of LEA-type proteins is largely unknown. However, their considerable synthesis during the late stage of embryogenesis, induction by stress and other 
			biophysical characteristics, such as hydrophilicity, random coils and repeating motifs permit prediction of some of their possible functions. LEA-type proteins 
			are reported to act as water-binding molecules, in ion sequestration and in macromolecule and membrane stabilization. [,]

LEA proteins are ubiquitous among photosynthetic organisms and have been reported in mono- and dicot plants as well as in nematodes, yeast, bacteria and 
			cyanobacteria. [] These proteins are encoded by multigene families with different number of conserved 
			residues motifs arranged in tandem as reported in cotton, maize, barley, Arabidopsis, mung bean, soybean etc. [] Our earlier work showed the occurrence of early-methionine (Em)-labeled proteins in the mung bean (Vigna radiata) axes, 
			referred as EMV proteins, the first ever report of such proteins in the Fabaceae family. [] The cDNAs 
			encoding these proteins were isolated, characterized and found to show certain level of similarity with other Em/ LEA proteins.

The results of an in silico analyses of these proteins based on their deduced amino acid sequences prove that these belong to group 1 LEA protein with 
			possible DNA/RNA binding function. Such a property may facilitate hydrogen bonding of these proteins with essentially any macromolecule or membrane thus 
			protecting the internal structures of the cell from being damaged due to altered physiological conditions.

Methodology
Datasets
The Em protein sequences of Vigna radiate, (EMV) - EMV1 and EMV2 (NCBI GenBank accession numbers U31210 and U31211; UniProt acc. Nos. 
			Q41684 and Q41685) and other sequences examined in this study were retrieved from the public databases, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [] and 
			http://www.ebi.ac.uk. []
			Structurally homologous subsets of the experimentally determined 3D structures of the EMV proteins were retrieved from PDB (Protein Data Bank) and SCOP 
			(Structural Classification of Proteins) databases.

Similarity Search and Pattern Recognition
BLAST searches of the Swiss-Prot TrEMBL and Uniprot-curated databases were performed using WU-BLAST2.0 algorithm developed by Washington University 
             [] in order to identify local alignments for the mung bean (Vigna radiate) proteins. 
             Further analysis of sequences was performed with tools available in the ExPasy Server (http://www.expasy.org/tools). [] The Interpro 
             analysis, based on the PROSITE and Pfam databases, was done to identify sequence patterns associated with the protein family and to determine the modular 
             architecture of these proteins. Physicochemical properties of the selected proteins were determined using the ProtParam tools. Hydropathy plots of the 
             deduced proteins were determined based on Kyte and Doolittle values. []

Homology Modeling and Protein Function-Prediction
The secondary structure analysis was performed using the PELE program of the SDSC Biology workbench (http://workbench.sdsc.edu/ []); intrinsic 
             disorders in the peptide sequences were identified by GLOBPLOT analysis based on Linding's values. [] Tertiary structure of the Vigna radiata LEA proteins was modeled by submitting the deduced amino acid sequences of 
             EMV proteins to the Computational Biology Service Unit, Cornell Theory Center, Cornell University, USA. The protein models were generated by aligning 
             to the structural homologues in the fold recognition program of LOOPP v3.0 (Learning, Observing and Outputting Protein Patterns) server. 
             [] The quality of the protein models was assessed using PROCHECK. The visual displays of 
             the models were performed by SwissPDB viewer. [] Function assignments were made based on 
             the structural homologues identified for the test EMV proteins.

Results and Discussion
Sequence homologues and presence of 20 residues long conserved motifs
WU-BLAST2 analysis of EMV proteins revealed the highest sequence identity to a group 1 LEA protein from the black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia 
			(87 %; UniProt: P93509) followed by several other group 1 LEA sequences including Arabidopsis thaliana (83 %; UniProt: Q42489), 
			water-stress protectant protein from Gossypium hirsutum (80 %; UniProt: Q03791), Em-like protein from Daucus carota (78 %; UniProt: 
			Q5KTS7) and Quercus robur (79 %; UniProt: Q7XBA7). Analysis of EMV2 protein sequence showed maximum sequence identity (87 %) to Glycine 
			max Em protein (UniProt: P93165) followed by Em protein from Robinia pseudoacacia (80 %; UniProt: P93510), LEA protein from Arachis hypogaea 
			(83 %; UniProt: Q4U4M1) and Arabidopsis thaliana Em like protein GEA6 (81 %; EM6). In addition, sequences with similarity to EMV proteins 
			were detected in the moss, Physcomitrella patens and in Bacillus subtilis, specific for the gsiB gene encoding a stress-related protein identified 
			based on the glucose starvation-inducibility. [] The other matches include hypothetical proteins 
			from different organisms with less significant E-values.

The occurrence of a 20 residues long repeat in group 1 LEA proteins () identified a 20-mer motif 
			‘GGQTRKQQLGSEGYHEMGRK’ at positions 44-63 and 64-83 in EMV1 and at position 44-63 in EMV2, characteristic in plants and other organisms 
			indicating that these proteins belong to group1 LEA family based on the revised classification system proposed by Wise []. This remarkable conservation points to an important role of LEA proteins in stress adaptation.

EMV proteins are hydrophilic and belong to pfam00477 Cluster
The accumulation of hydrophilic transcripts was demonstrated in E. coli and S. cerevisiae as well as from nematode 
			and moss. Hydropathy plots revealed that EMV proteins are highly hydrophilic with over 95 % residues falling in the hydrophilic regions with 
			negative scores (). The grand average hydropathicity values of EMV1 (-1.421) and EMV2 (-1.497) suggest that 
			these proteins are highly hydrated in aqueous environment. Profile search for Vigna LEA proteins revealed 78 % identity to 
			LEA19 protein of Gossypium hirsutum; thus, classifying this protein into a pfam 00477 cluster (LEA-5 domain) with a small hydrophilic 
			plant signature motif (GETWPGGT) at the residues 18-26 in both EMV1 and EMV2.

The structure prediction program and intrinsic disorder prediction suggest that EMV proteins maybe largely or entirely unstructured in solution. 
			Firstly, the consensus identified for EMV proteins by structure prediction programs revealed predominantly random coil structure with two small regions 
			of β sheets and five distinct helical blocks (). Secondly, the GLOBPLOT analysis () revealed intrinsic disorders in EMV1 (residue positions 20-29, 40-46, 49-66 and 80-91) and EMV2 (residues 
			20-28, 40-46, 60-71 and 93-97). Secondary structures were also observed as hydrophobic clusters and corresponded with the 1D and 3D representations 
			(). Low hydrophobic levels of proteins with relatively high overall charge are associated with a lack 
			of compactness in proteins under physiological conditions resulting in a natively unfolded structure []

Polypeptide chain flexibility and conserved double glycine residues
The internal hydrophilic motif of EMV proteins is flanked by the conserved double glycine residues with approximately 20 amino acid intervals giving a 
			pattern in which the entire sequence of the mung bean LEA proteins could be viewed as consisting of 20 residues domains separated by structurally flexible 
			double glycine residues. Variable number of hydrophilic motif suggests a higher water-binding capacity as seen by the presence of repeats that are most 
			hydrophilic part of mung bean LEA proteins. This observation is in good agreement with the findings of [] for the barley B19 LEA proteins.

Functional implications of Vigna LEA proteins
SCOP analysis showed that EMV proteins share structural homology to proteins with helical bundles of small proteins and DNA/RNA binding proteins 
			(PDB: 2CCY, 1IG6 and 1EXE). Ab initio predictions indicate that 32.14% of the EMV1 and 32.32% of EMV2 protein attain 
			helical conformation as represented by helical blocks in the 3D hypothetical models (). Our earlier 
			observation [] of low molecular weight protein from dry mungbean embryonic axes showing 
			aggregation of 12 kDa monomeric polypeptide into tetramer with apparent molecular weight of 50 kDa in the gel filtration studies corroborates 
			the above finding. [] Their highly conserved nature and stress induced structural transition 
			suggest EMV proteins to resemble LEA proteins and consequently share similar hypothetical functions.

Homology models validated by PROCHECK essentially satisfy the stereo-chemical parameters with well-refined structures at similar resolutions. 
			[] The distribution of residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot for 
			EMV1 and EMV2 is 87.6 % and 93 %, respectively (). Thus, EMV1 is ‘fairly 
			good’ while that of EMV2 is a ‘good’ hypothetical protein model. The homology model of mung bean LEA proteins, thus generated 
			in this study, could aid in determining the mechanistic function of this important class of proteins.

Conclusions
Vigna radiata EMV proteins are classified under group 1 LEA proteins based on their extreme hydrophilicity and predominantly 
			random-coiled arrangement of the residues along with the adoption of helical conformation as revealed by ab initio secondary structure 
			predictions. Function assignments of these two LEA proteins suggest that they are involved in DNA/RNA binding action like other group 1 LEA proteins. 
			Such a property may facilitate hydrogen bonding of these EMV proteins with essentially any macromolecule or membrane thus protecting the internal 
			structures of the cell from being damaged due to altered physiological conditions. EMV proteins with the consistent spatial arrangements hence point 
			to the possibility that they have a functional role in the plant's response to dehydration.
