Background
The presence of the Y chromosome determines the male
characteristics in a mammalian embryo []. It is one of the smallest
chromosomes in the human genome (âˆ¼60Mb) with a limited number
of genes []. The human Y chromosome comprises 59 million base
pairs approximately (59,373,566 bps) with 61 known protein-coding
genes, 25 novel protein-coding genes, 282 pseudogenes, 15 miRNA
genes, 6 rRNA gens,13 snRNA genes, 1 snoRNA genes, 1 Misc
RNA genes showing about 91,437 SNPs. The complete sequence of
the male specific region of Y chromosome (MSY) comprising 95%
of the chromosome length revealed about 78 protein-coding genes
and about 27 are distinct proteins []. Y chromosome loss and
rearrangements have been associated with different types of
oncogenic disorders like male sex cord stroma tumor [], lung
cancer [], esophageal carcinoma [], germ cell tumor 
[], turners
syndrome [] and bladder cancer []. Both oncogenes and tumour
suppressor genes are hypothesised be present in this chromosome
causing genetic disorders in male-specific organs such as testis [].
The human male infertility has been attributed to mutations in the
genes on Y chromosome []. Genetic or inherited disease or
specific abnormalities in the Y chromosome are major factors for
male infertility. Infertility men reveal many abnormal conditions,
which include azoospermia, oligozoospermia, teratozoospermia,
asthenozoospermia, necrospermia and pyospermia []. Despite its
central role in sex determination, genetic analysis of the Y
chromosome has been limited due to the paucity of available genetic
markers []. MSY genes participate in diverse processes such as
skeletal growth, germ cell tumorigenesis, graft rejection, gonadal
sex determination, and spermatogenic failure []. A study on the
function prediction of the 107 hypothetical proteins of the Y
chromosome proteins is performed. Here, we describe the use of
prediction methods to characterize the unknown functional
information using sequence and modelled structural data and store
derived data in the form of a database.

Methodology
Dataset
Homo sapiens Y chromosome protein sequences were retrieved
from the EBI-EMBL database in FASTA format. A total of 196
proteins are available (May 2008) and 107 protein sequences have
not yet been characterized.

Sequence analysis
Sequence analysis was done using protein sequence analysis tools
such as COMPUTE Pi/Mw [], PROTPARAM [] &amp; RADAR
[]. Various physical and chemical properties such as molecular
weight, theoretical pI, amino acid composition, atomic composition,
extinction coefficient, estimated half life, instability index, aliphatic
index and grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) were
computed. Internal duplication and alignment of repeats were
predicted using RADAR.

Secondary structure analysis
Secondary structure prediction analysis was performed using online
tools such as GOR IV (Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson IV) [], HNN
(Hierarchial Neural Network) [] and SOPMA (Self Optimized
Prediction Method with Alignment) [].

Template search
Template is selected by BLAST search against protein databank
(PDB) with &gt; 40% sequence identity cut off [].

Tertiary structure analysis
Tertiary structure prediction was performed using I-Tasser Server
for ab initio structure prediction [] and SWISS-MODEL for
homology modelling []. The 3D structures modelled were
visualized using PYMOL.

Structure validation
Structure validations for the modelled 3D structures were done by
using SAVS server (structure analysis and verification servers) for
PROCHECK analysis [], Artificial Intelligence Decoys Evaluator
(AIDE) [] and ProQ [].

Function prediction
The query protein sequences were subjected to BLAST [],
INTERPROSCAN [], COG [], and 
PFAM [] to assign
predicted biochemical and cellular functions. The results were
analyzed based on the confidence level of 25% using default
parameters. Results from different tools were summed up to
calculate 100% reliability.

Database
We present the derived data in the form a form a database made
freely available for download, review, refinement and update.

Database features
The human Y chromosome has been studied for more than 30 years.
It is used as a powerful tool to study human population and
evolutionary data. The most characterizing feature of this
chromosome is in human sex determination and in male germ cell
development and maintenance. Therefore, it is important to
document physical and chemical properties, sequence comparison,
secondary structures, folding class, tertiary structure and
biochemical information. Properties such as molecular weight,
theoretical pI, estimated half life, extinction coefficients, instability
index, aliphatic index, grand average of hydro-pathicity along with
the number of negatively and positively charged residues were also
document for each entry.

Weight and atoms
In the dataset, the entry A8MQV7 has the highest no of atoms
16175 with molecular weight 114705.1 and highest number of
negatively charged residues (139). On the other hand, the entry
Q6KER0 has the lowest total no of atoms and molecular weight of
159 and 1132.3, respectively.

Theoretical pI
Q13381 was found to have the highest theoretical pI of 12.31, while
A6NMP8 was found to have the lowest theoretical pI 3.29.

Half life
Half life is the predicted time it takes for half of the amount of
protein in a cell to disappear after synthesis. An acceptable value of
30 half life was found in all the proteins.

Extinction coefficient
Extinction coefficient indicates the light absorbed by proteins at a
certain wavelength. A6NDE4 in the dataset was found to have the
highest extinction co-efficient value of 79900 while and A6NM12
showed the least value of 0.

Instability Index
The instability index provided the stability of a protein. A highest
value of 142.90 and lowest value of -51.21 was recorded for entries
O14606 and A8MWL0, respectively in the dataset.

Aliphatic Index
The aliphatic index of a protein was the relative volume occupied
by the aliphatic side chains (alanine, valine, isoleucine and leucine).
The entry A8MW33 has the highest aliphatic index of 136.53 and a
lowest value of 7.22 for A6NMP8.

GRAVY
The GRAVY value for a peptide or protein was calculated as the
sum of hydropathy values of all the amino acids divided by the
number of residues in the sequence. The maximum (0.860) and
minimum (-1.404) values are recorder for entries A2RUG3 and
A6NDE4, respectively in the dataset.

Charged residues
The highest number of negatively charged amino acids (139) was
found in A8MQV7 and the number of positively charged residues
was found to be highest in Q24JR0 (94). A NIL value is recorded
for the entry A6NMP8.

Predominant residues
The frequencies of individual residues were calculated in terms of
their percentages for each entry. The entry Q13381 had the highest
percentage of amino acid serine (23.8%) followed by arginine with
22.2% in Q6KERO.

Atomic composition
Atomic compositions each protein was calculated by
PROTPARAM. The entry A8MQV7 has the highest composition of
major atoms while and least number is recorder for Q6KER0.

Repeats
Analysis shows that 39 protein sequences in the dataset showed the
presence of repeats. This is not true with the remaining entries in the
dataset. Among those with repeats, the entry Q24JR0 showed the
highest number (20) of repeats at positions (9-718) with different
scores.

Secondary structures
Secondary structure prediction was done using GOR, HNN &amp;
SOPMA. The entry Q8N4A2 has the highest percentage of alpha
helix in the dataset. Q6KER0, A6NNB5 and A6NII1 have the
highest percentage of extended strand while Q9BZ97 has the lowest
percentage.

Random coils
A6NII1 has the highest percentage of random coil while A6NNB5
has the lowest percentage of random coil.

Homology models
Homology modelling was done using SWISS MODELLER. The
templates (A6NLN9 -2ZCY, A6NJH9-1D7Q, A6NMX1-1LL2,
A8MTA1-2I13, A8MUG6-2NZ2, Q13369-2FY1, Q13374-2FY1)
were used to model the 3D structures for 7 entries. The remaining
100 entries were modelled using the I-Tasser server.

Functional interpretation
The sequences in the dataset were subjected to BLAST,
INTERPROSCAN, COG, and PFAM to predict function. In this
analysis, 10 proteins (A6NDE4, A6NEQ7, A6NJH9, A6NMU8,
A8MUG6, Q8TD47, Q496E4, P22090, P0C7P1, and A6NEQ0)
were identified to produce 100% reliable functions such as RNA
recognition motif, ankyrin, eukaryotic initiation factor, neuroligin,
argininosuccinate synthase, ribosomal protein S4E and RNA
binding proteins, respectively. However, 24 different proteins were
predicted with 75% confidence levels, among which, 11 proteins
(A6NEC3, A6NFC0, A6NMT9, A8MZ49, A8MU69, A6NFK1,
A6NGF5, A6NGT6, A6NDJ3, A6NJD2, A4FUW6) to have a
unique function of nucleosome assemble protein, while 4 proteins
(A6NMX1, A6NLN9, A6NHG5, A6NIC0) are of glycosyl
transferase family 8 function. The remaining 9 proteins had
different function with entry A6NCS7 for Tetratricopeptide repeat,
Q24JR0 for Zfx / Zfy transcription activation region, O43610 for
Sprouty protein, A8MUH9 for Y chromosome RNA recognition
motif, A8MT17 for zinc finger, A8MQV7 for serine protease
Inhibitor, A6NJK3 for tektin, A6NJY1 for sodium/hydrogen
exchanger family and Q99218-2 for amelogenin.

Conclusion
More than hundred human Y chromosome proteins (107) have not
yet been characterized. We used I-Tasser to model 100 structures
and SWISS MODELER for the remaining 7 proteins. 39 protein
sequences indicate the internal repeats in RADAR and function
prediction with 10 proteins (100% confidence), 24 proteins (75%
confidence), 12 proteins (50% confidence) and 14 proteins (25%
confidence). Analysis shows that most proteins are similar to
ribosomal protein S4E, nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) and
RNA-binding proteins. We present these data in the form a web
database made available freely over the internet.
