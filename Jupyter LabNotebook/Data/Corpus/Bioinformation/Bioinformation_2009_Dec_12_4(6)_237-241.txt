Background
The M group of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is divided
into nine non-recombinant subtypes (A-D, F-H, J, K) []. The amino
acid variations in the env gene between the subtypes in the M group
are 25-35 per cent, while in the gag gene it is about 15 per cent []. A
recent study has shown that HIV disease progression can be influenced
by the subtype []. In addition to structural genes HIV-1 has
functional genes which express proteins essential for viral survival and
propagation []. One such functional gene tat mediates an important
role in transcription of the HIV-1 LTR []. Studies have also shown
that there is a variation in levels of Tat transactivation among the
different subtypes [,]. The tat mRNA is a multiply spliced mRNA
and consists of two coding (1 and 2) and one noncoding exon.
Mutational analysis studies have shown that Tat protein can be
functionally organized into different domains []. The study
sequences encompassed the following domains: N-terminal domain
(amino acid positions 1-20), Cys-rich domain (amino acid positions
21-40), Lys X Leu Gly Ile X Tyr motif (amino acid positions 41-48),
basic domain (49-57) and the auxiliary domain (amino acid positions
58-67). Further studies on the Tat have shown that alteration of even
one of the domains can affect the proper functioning of the Tat protein
[]. The Cys-rich domain has been suggested to be important for
protein dimerization whereas the basic domain contains the argininerich
RNA binding motif (ARM) and acts as a nuclear localization
signal []. The auxiliary domain is believed to contribute to Tat
activity by structural stabilization or by direct functional contribution
[]. We have used Tat (exon1) HIV-1 sequences of subtype B and
subtype C strains obtained from GenBank and attempted to observe
for amino acid differences in the different regions of Tat protein (exon
1) of subtype B and C strains to find a molecular basis for differences
in protein function.

Methodology
HIV-1 sequences of subtype B (n=30) and C (n=60) strains were
downloaded from HIV-1 Los Alamos data base
(www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/). Among the 60 subtype C
strain sequences downloaded, 30 were from India and the other 30
were from Africa. The accession numbers and subtypes of the strains
are mentioned in  . Among the 30 subtype B strains
downloaded, information on co-receptor usage was available for 10
strains. The accession numbers of 5 strains that utilized CCR5 coreceptors
were M93258, U23487, U04908, M65024 and M68893 and
accession numbers for the 5 that utilized CXCR4 were U39362,
M17449, M17451, K02007 and L31963. The CCR5 strains were
considered as NSI and the CXCR4 were considered as SI for this
study. The accession numbers of the CXCR4 and CCR5 utilizing
strain were obtained from the dataset used to construct classifiers for
Wetcat, which allows determination of HIV-1 co-receptor usage
(http://genomiac2.ucsd.edu:8080/wetcat/ v3.html).

A HIV-1 Tat protein (exon 1) sequence was obtained from the
’sequence search interface‘ in the Los Alamos HIV-1 sequence data 
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/components/sequence/HIV/search/search.html. 
The consensus B and C sequence was also obtained from the Los
Alamos HIV-1 sequence data using the following options “Alignment
type: Subtype reference, Year: 2007, Organism: HIV1, Region: TAT,
Subtype: All, DNA/Protein: DNA, Format: FASTA”
(http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html).
The sequences were downloaded on 10th June 2009. The subtype C
reference sequence, accession number AF067155 (India) and
AY772699 (Africa), was used for alignment of the 60 sequences
obtained from GenBank. The nucleotide sequences were translated
using the ExPasy translate tool
(http://sosnick.uchicago.edu/translate_dna.html). The alignment of the
nucleotide and amino acid sequences obtained was done using
clustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/ clustalw/).

The sequences were visualized using Weblogo
(http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi). The net charges of the amino
acid sequence of the consensus subtype C and B sequences were also calculated 
(http://www.innovagen.se/custom-peptide-synthesis/peptideproperty- calculator/peptide-property-calculator.asp). 
The RNA binding regions of the three consensus sequence (subtype C from India
and Africa and subtype B) were also determined using BindN
(http://bioinfo.ggc.org/bindn/) []. A specificity of 80% was used, by
default, for determining the RNA binding regions. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed for the amino acid sequences with Mega 4
software using a minimum evolution method and bootstrap value of
500 replicates []. The evolutionary distances were computed using
the Poisson correction method.

Results
When compared to subtype B, subtype C strains from India showed
variation at amino acid positions 7, 19, 29,35, 39,
57,60,61,63,64,67,68 and 69. In the phylogenetic tree the study
sequences were shown to form two divergent clusters which were
composed exclusively of either subtype B or subtype C strains (). When compared to subtype B, subtype C strains from Africa
showed variation at amino acid positions 7, 12, 19, 24,29,31,35, 39,
53, 54 57,60,61,63,64,67,68 and 69. When compared to subtype C
strains from Africa, subtype C strains from India showed variation at
amino acid positions 2,7, 21, 23, 29, 31, 36, 37, 53, 60, 61 ‐ 64 and 71.
In this study, there was a high level of divergence in the auxiliary
domain of subtype B and C sequences (amino acid positions 58 ‐ 69).
Among the Indian subtype C, 30 strains (100%) had Asn at position 7
as compared to Arg, Ser, Lys and Asn in the consensus subtype B and
C (African) sequence. The other amino acid changes between Indian
subtype C and subtype B are as follows (in parenthesis indicates the
amino acid present in the consensus subtype B strain): 90% showed
Asn (Lys) at position 12, 90% showed Gln (Thr,Ile) at position 39,
93% showed Ser (Arg) at position 57, 97% showed Pro (Gln) at
position 60, 87% showed Ser (Asp) at position 61, 90% showed Glu
(Gln) at position 63, 100% showed Asp (Thr) at position 64, 97%
showed Asn (Val) at position 67, 80% showed Leu (Ser) at position 68
and 93% showed Ile (Leu) at position 69. The amino acid sequences of
subtype B and C can be visualized as a sequence logo in .
When comparing the amino acid sequences of SI and NSI subtype B
strains there were no changes that could be classified as being distinct
for each group.

The net charge of the consensus subtype C (Indian) Tat protein (exon
1) was 8 at pH 7 and it had an isoelectric point of 9.6. The net charge
of the consensus subtype C (African) Tat protein (exon 1) was 5 at pH
7 and it had an isoelectric point of 8.8. While the net charge of the
consensus subtype B Tat protein (exon 1) was 11 at pH 7 and it had an
isoelectric point of 10.1. The molecular weight of the Tat protein
(exon 1) consensus subtype B was 8235.6. The molecular weight of
the Tat protein (exon 1) consensus subtype C, Indian and African
based on the amino acid sequences was 8162.4 and 8194.3,
respectively. The ratio of the hydrophilic residues to the total number
of residues was 49% in subtype C (Indian) which was higher than
subtype B(44%) and African subtype C (45%). The net charge of the
subtype C (Indian) Tat protein (exon 1) auxiliary domain (amino acid
positions 58-67) was -1.9 at pH 7 and it had an isoelectric point of 4.1.
The net charge of the subtype C (African) Tat protein (exon 1)
auxiliary domain (amino acid positions 58-67) was -2.9 at pH 7 and it
had an isoelectric point of 3.7. The ratio of the hydrophilic residues to
the total number of residues was 60% in the in both the Indian and
African subtype C in the auxiliary domain. The net charge of same
region in subtype B was -0.9 at pH 7 and it had an isoelectric point of
4.9. The ratio of the hydrophilic residues to the total number of
residues was 50% in subtype B. The molecular weight of the auxiliary
domain of the Tat protein (exon 1) consensus subtype B was 1110.1.
The molecular weight of the Tat protein (exon 1) subtype C based on
the amino acid sequences at amino acid positions 58-67 for the Indian
and African sequences were 1081.1 and 1112.1, respectively. The
predicted RNA binding regions are shown in . The consensus
subtype B sequence was found to have 36 RNA binding sites while
subtype C (India) had 33 and subtype C (Africa) had 32 RNA binding
sites. The predominant predicted RNA binding sites for subtype B was
from amino acid positions 46-64, while for the subtype C both from
Africa and India it was in amino acid positions 46-63.

Discussion
The amino acid sequences of Tat protein (exon 1) from subtype B and
C strains showed distinct differences. This was observed in the
phylogenetic tree where subtype B and C diverged and formed distinct
clusters, showing a certain level of distinct evolution. There was also a
difference in the ratio of the hydrophilic residues to the total number
of residues between the subtypes. There was one amino acid change at
position 57 in 13 subtype C strains on comparison to subtype B strains.
Ninety three percent of clade C strains from India showed Ser at
position 57 instead of Arg which is seen at position 57 among 90%
subtype B strains. Serine has uncharged and small side chains as
compared to Arg. The basic domain in which these changes were seen
is responsible for the transportation of the Tat to the nucleus and
nucleolus7. The implication of this change in the basic domain of Tat
possibly affects relocation to the nucleus but will have to be further
investigated. Most cytosol proteins function optimally when their
isoelectric point is close to the ambient pH which in a resting T cells is
7.2. The isoelectric point of subtype C (India) Tat protein (exon 1)
protein (9.6) is closer to 7.2 as compared to subtype B (10.1) and may
be hence more efficient in transactivation of LTR element. The
subtype C (African) Tat protein (exon 1) had an isoelectric point of 8.8
which is the closest to 7.2 compared to the values of the other
consensus sequences uses in this study. The HIV-1 Tat-TAR
(transactivation responsive) interaction is a potential target for
inhibitors []. The Tat protein is also being considered for its
potential use in HIV-1 vaccines []. This could be potentially
important especially with the recent failure of the Merck HIV-1
vaccine trials []. The Merck vaccine made use of sequences from
the gag, env and the nef region. Although Tat based vaccines would
not be able to prevent an individual acquiring infection it could block
viral replication and disease onset (post exposure vaccine) []. Invitro
studies have shown subtype C Tat protein to have a higher
transactivational potential than subtype B [,,]. Development of
such inhibitor/vaccines would have to take into consideration the
variation of the Tat proteins not only in terms of their activity but also
the variation in amino acid sequence analyzed in this study which
could determine epitope presentation on MHC class I antigen for
afferent immune response.

The phylogenetic tree constructed using HIV-1 Tat protein (exon 1) amino acid sequences of subytpe B and clade C strains. The
evolutionary history was inferred using the Minimum Evolution method. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 500 replicates is taken to
represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed. Branches corresponding to partitions reproduced in less than 50% bootstrap replicates are
collapsed. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) is shown next to
the branch. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic
tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method and are in the units of the number of amino acid
substitutions per site. The ME tree was searched using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange (CNI) algorithm at a search level of 1. The Neighborjoining
algorithm was used to generate the initial tree. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated from the dataset.
