Background
Influenza A virus is enveloped and contains eight segments of single 
stranded, negative sense RNA, which encodes 11 proteins (HA, NA, NP, 
M1, M2, NS1, NEP, PA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2). The PB2, PB1, and PA 
encoded proteins form a polymerase complex for transcription, and are 
associated at one end of each gene segment  []. The classification of 
influenza A virus is based on the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin 
and neuraminidase glycoproteins, which are expressed on the surface of 
virus particle. Hemagglutinin is responsible for the binding of virions to 
host cell receptor and membrane fusion  [].  The host cell consists of a 
terminal sialic acid residue that is usually found in either an α2-3 or α2-6 
linkage to galactose. Human influenza virus prefers binding to Sia(α2-
6)Gal linked saccharide, whereas avian influenza virus prefers binding to 
Sia(α2-3)Gal [].

There have been three influenza A pandemics in the 20th century. While the 
first pandemic caused by the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus 
resulted about 50 million deaths in 1918-1919, the subsequent pandemics 
caused by the H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes in 1957 and 1967 respectively led 
to one million deaths each []. The H5N1 subtype became a serious threat 
in 2003-2008, due to its high death rate, as well as its potential to cause 
widespread pandemic []. More recently, outbreaks of H1N1, also known 
as the Swine Flu, spreading rapidly across major parts of the world have 
resulted in the classification of the phenomenon by the World Health 
Organization's classification as the 21st century pandemic  
[]. For a viral 
strain to become pandemic, three  requirements  must be fulfilled. Firstly, 
the viral strain should be able to enter the human body. Secondly, it should 
be capable of replicating within human hosts and finally, it should cause 
diseases that are easily-transmissible among humans  []. Recently, there 
have been several exciting investigations of the relationship between the 
binding mode of the hemagglutinin protein and the pandemic ability of the 
influenza A viruses. One interesting finding is that Sia(α2-3)Gal forms 
multiple strong hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with the 
hemagglutinin protein of H5N1 virus, whereas Sia(α2-6)Gal exhibits weak 
interactions to the same protein  []. On the other hand, Miotto  et al.
identified an influenza A PB2 component that can adapt to enable humanto-human transmissions  
[]. More importantly, it has been proposed that 
the ability of the hemagglutinin protein of the H1N1 influenza A virus 
strain to attach to Sia(α2-6)Gal instead of Sia(α2-3)Gal has enabled the 
replication and transmission of the virus among humans [].

Based on the observation that all influenza A viruses prior to the pandemic 
H1N1 strain are highly pathogenic and not transmissible, we propose that 
specific amino acid mutations present in the hemagglutinin protein of the 
pandemic H1N1 strain serve to enable its replication and transmission 
ability within and among humans. In this study, we investigated this 
hypothesis using sequence, structural and functional analysis methods, 
with the aim of identifying possible amino acid mutations that affect the 
specificity of the H1N1 hemagglutinin protein to the sialic acid receptor.

Methodology
Data collection
Amino acid sequences of hemagglutinin influenza A virus subtypes 
H1N1,H2N2, H3N2  and  H5N1  isolated  from  humans  and  ducks  were 
downloaded from the Influenza Virus Resources database created by the 
National Center for Biotechnology Information (http:// 
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Database.html). Only sequences 
isolated in pandemic years were collected, since hemagglutinin of these 
sequences binds specifically to Sia(α2-6)Gal. Sequences from ducks 
isolated in pandemic years were collected to serve as control protein 
sequences with binding specificity to Sia(α2-3)Gal [].

Sequence mutation analysis
ClustalW2 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html)  
[]  was 
used to perform multiple sequence alignment of the collected 
hemagglutinin protein sequence to identify specific mutations in the 
hemagglutinin receptor binding domain in human isolates compared to the 
control duck isolates. The sequence mutation analysis was limited to amino 
acids in the receptor binding domain which is located at the 130 loop 
(positions 134-138), 190 helix (positions 190-198) and 220 loop (positions 
221-228). The positions are specific to H3 A/Aichi/2/68.

Structural Analysis
The three dimensional structures of the hemagglutinin protein from 
different influenza A subtypes (both human and duck isolates), Sia(α2-
6)Gal and Sia(α2-3)Gal were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank 
(http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=search/index.html). Hemagglutinin 
structures with 100 % similarity to the receptor binding domain of the 
hemagglutinin sequence were selected for each subtype  (Table 1, see 
).  

The hemagglutinin structures of the duck and human isolates specific to 
each subtype were superimposed using Pymol v0.99 []. The Root Mean 
Square Deviation (RMSD) score, which represents similarity in the threedimensional structure, 
were then calculated. RMSD value which are lower 
than 2 are deemed significant since it denotes two closely related protein 
structures (Table 2, see )

Molecular docking
The 3D structures of hemagglutinin proteins of the pandemic H1N1 strain 
isolated from human (PDB accession no: 1RD8) and from duck (PDB 
accession no: 3HTT) were docked to their respective sialic acids using 
Autodock 4.0. For each round of molecular docking, the hemagglutinin 
structure was defined as the receptor molecule, while structure of Sia(α2-
3)Gal or Sia(α2-6)Gal were defined as the ligand. Both receptor protein 
and ligand molecules were prepared by removing all water molecules, 
adding hydrogen atoms and adding charges. The energies of the resultant 
docked complexes were minimized to relieve bad contacts using the 
conjugate gradient method in Vega ZZ 2.3.1 []. The final structures were 
visualized and evaluated with Pymol v0.99. 

Results
Sequence mutation analysis
The multiple sequence alignment () of the hemagglutinin receptor 
binding domains of influenza A H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 and H5N1 subtypes 
from duck and human isolates shows specific mutations in both positions 
190 (in A/Brevig Mission/1/18(H1N1), A/New York/1/18(H1N1) and 
A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1)) and 225 (in A/South 
Carolina/1/1918(H1N1), A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1) and A/Puerto 
Rico/8/34(H1N1)). The sequences of all duck isolates contain glutamic 
acid in position 190 and glycine in position 225, whereas in the pandemic 
H1N1 human isolates, both positions have been substituted with aspartic 
acid. While both glutamic acid and aspartic acid at position 190 in the duck 
and human isolates possess highly similar physiochemical properties, the 
mutation at position 225 is one that involves a substation of hydrophobic 
glycine in the duck isolates with hydrophilic aspartic acid in the human 
isolates.

The H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes, on the other hand, exhibited a different 
mutation pattern  between  their  corresponding  duck  and human isolates 
when compared to the H1N1 subtype. Mutations in H1N1 occurred in 
position 225, while mutations between the duck and human isolates in both 
the H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes occurred at positions 226 and 228 (in 
A/Guiyang/1/1957(H2N2), A/Kayano/57(H2N2) , A/Aichi/2/1968(H3N2), 
A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) and A/Memphis/1/68(H3N2)). Here, the 
amino acids glutamine at position 226 and glycine at position 228 in the 
duck isolates have been observed to mutate to leucine and serine in the 
human isolates, respectively. While the mutation at position 226 involves a 
substitution of hydrophilic glutamine with hydrophobic leucine, the 
mutation at position 228, on the other hand, has been observed to involve a 
reverse substitution of hydrophobic glycine with hydrophilic serine. 
Notably, no mutation has been observed in the influenza A H5N1 subtype, 
between the duck and human isolates, suggesting a possibility that the 
H5N1 subtype exhibits absolute specificity to Sia(α2-3)Gal.

Based on the multiple sequence alignment, we suggest two possible amino 
acid mutation patterns in the hemagglutinin receptor binding domain of 
influenza A viruses which can potentially contribute to its specificity 
towards Sia (α2-6)Gal. These mutation patterns are those occurring in 
positions 190 and 225 (E190 D and G225D) in the pandemic H1N1 strains 
and those in positions 226 and 228 (Q226L and G228S) in the H2N2 and 
H3N2 subtypes respectively. We propose that mutations that occur beside 
receptor binding domain can potentially affect substrate specificity, as well 
as antigenicity and pathogenicity. 

Structural analysis of hemagglutinin receptor binding domain
To visualize the structural differences between the duck and human 
isolates of each subtype, we superimposed the structures of one reference 
duck isolate and one reference human isolate for each subtype and 
measured the root mean square deviation (RMSD) value between the 
structures of these duck and human isolates. 


The H1N1 (3HTT &amp; 1RD8), H3N2 (1MQN &amp; 1HGF), and H5N1 (1JSN &amp; 
2FK0) subtypes have been observed to possess RMSD values of 1.624Å 
(), 0.322Å (), 
and 0.451Å () between the duck 
and human isolates specific to each subtype respectively. The low RMSD 
values (≫2Å) suggest that the receptor binding domain structures between 
the duck and human isolate in each specific subtype are closely related and 
have little structural differences. The results verify our hypothesis that the 
specificity of hemagglutinin to sialic acid can be influenced solely by 
amino acid changes in the receptor binding domain, highlighted in the 
multiple sequence alignment [].

The sequence mutation analysis has shown two possible amino acid 
mutation patterns that contribute to the recognition of Sia(α2-6)Gal in 
human isolates. We explored the proposed mutations at the threedimensional 
level by visualizing the change in conformation in the receptor 
binding domain brought about by the mutations. We superimposed the 
structures of H5N1 and H1N1, as well as the H5N1 and H3N2 structures 
from human isolates. H5N1 was used as the reference point of comparison 
since it is the most threatening influenza virus. The RMSD values between 
H5N1 and H1N1 were determined to be 0.666Å (), while the 
RMSD value between H5N1 and H3N2 were determined to be 1.042Å 
(). The values imply that the structure differences between H5N1 
and H1N1 are not obvious, while the structures of H5N1 and H3N2 are 
very closely related. 

Molecular docking of hemagglutinin with sialic acid receptor
Next, we performed molecular docking using Autodock 4.0 to dock the 
pandemic H1N1 hemagglutin structure to Sia(α2-3)Gal and Sia(α2-6)Gal 
respectively. The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the quality of the 
two complexes and predict the specificity of hemagglutin to sialic acid. 
The quality of each complex was examined using the output score (Total 
Intermolecular Energy in kcal/mol) of AutoDock, which provides an 
estimation  of  ΔG°  binding  and  inhibition  constant. In  general, a stable 
complex is regarded to have been formed if the sialic acid residue can enter 
the receptor binding domain of hemagglutinin and interact with the 
important residues Asp190, Leu226, and Ser228. 

Based on the general rule of thumb, the hemagglutinin structure 3HTT, 
which is an isolate from duck, possesses the ability to recognize Sia(α2-
3)Gal and Sia(α2-6)Gal, since entry of both sialic acid residues to the 
receptor binding domain have been observed (). The recognitions 
are in accordance with the minimum allowed Total Intermolecular Energy 
threshold, which further establishes the binding feasibility. However, the 
hemagglutinin isolate from human (PDB accession no: 1RD8) only 
exhibits specificity to Sia(α2-6)Gal, since only Sia(α2-6)Gal can enter the 
receptor binding domain (). Results from molecular docking are 
consistent with the results of Glaser et. al that the mutation of single amino 
acid back to the avian consensus resulted in a preference for the receptor 
binding site of avian HA [].

Discussion
In this study, we have analyzed the sequences of the hemagglutinin protein 
across influenza A subtypes and identified mutation patterns occurring in 
positions 190 and 225 (E190 D and G225D) and positions 226 and 228 
(Q226L and G228S) respectively, which can cause a change in chemical 
properties in the protein, ultimately affecting its binding specificity to 
sialic acid. The amino acid differences are investigated at a threedimensional 
level via molecular docking methods to further validate the 
proposed change in binding specificity.

The results highlight the feasibility of an approach incorporating sequence, 
functional and structural analysis in predicting the effect of sequence 
mutations on the structure and function, specifically the human to human 
transmission capability, of the hemagglutinin protein in influenza virus. 
Integration approach as such employed in this study can be applied to 
facilitate the design of novel drugs. The high mutation rate of the virus 
necessitates the use of creative and intelligent methods to design novel 
treatment. In this regard, bioinformatics approaches represent one of the 
most feasible ways to cope with such a short and demanding time frame 
posed by these mutations. As such, influenza drug design in the future will 
be more dependent on  in silico methods, due to the greater rate of 
discovery as compared to laboratory methods, which can better comply 
with the high mutation rate of the influenza virus. Nevertheless, 
bioinformatics approaches have to be ultimately validated and verified 
through laboratory experiments.

Conclusion
Hemagglutinin is the primary determinant of host biochemical function for 
its role in host cell recognition and attachment. It has been established that 
hemagglutinin in human influenza viruses prefers Sia(α2-6)Gal linked 
saccharide, whereas hemagglutinin in avian influenza viruses prefers 
Sia(α2-3)Gal  []. 
In our study, we identified two possible mutation 
patterns in the receptor binding domain of the hemagglutinin protein of the 
pandemic H1N1 strain that contributes to the shift in recognition 
specificity from Sia(α2-3)Gal to Sia(α2-6)Gal, thereby potentially enabling 
the replication and transmissibility of influenza strains in turn. These 
mutation patterns identified include 1) mutations in positions 190 and 225 
to aspartic acid (E190D in A/Brevig Mission/1/18(H1N1), A/New 
York/1/18(H1N1) and A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1) and G225D on 
A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1), A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1), and 
A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1)) and 2) mutations in position 226 and 228 to 
leucine and serine (Q226L and G228S in A/Guiyang/1/1957(H2N2), 
A/Kayano/57(H2N2), A/Aichi/2/1968(H3N2) and A/Hong 
Kong/1/1968(H3N2), A/Memphis/1/68(H3N2)). To validate our results, 
we performed molecular docking analysis to predict hemagglutinin 
specificity by analyzing the computationally docked complex of 
hemagglutinin and sialic acid. The results show that such an approach can 
provide useful information for predicting mutations in the hemagglutinin 
protein in influenza A virus strains that could lead to the capability of 
human to human transmission and therefore, to cause pandemics.
