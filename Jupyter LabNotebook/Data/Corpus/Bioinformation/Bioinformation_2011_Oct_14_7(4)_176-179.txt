Background:
Bacterial chromosomes often carry integrated genetic elements
(for example transposons, prophages and islands) whose
precise functions and contribution to the evolutionary fitness of
the host bacterium are still unknown []. These elements are
often associated with the pathogenicity of the organisms, for
example the CTXφ prophage, which encodes cholera toxin in
Vibrio cholerae []. 
Retron is also a transposable element []
found in various pathogenic bacteria []. The retron is
consisting of three regions- msr (encodes RNA part of msDNA),
msd (encodes DNA part of msDNA) and a ret gene for reverse
transcriptase (RT) [–]. This enzyme is responsible for the
production of multi-copy single-stranded DNA (msDNA)
containing both DNA and RNA covalently linked by a
branched rG residue [–]. Although, reverse transcriptase (RT)
was first discovered in virus [], now this enzyme is frequently
found in bacteria which are then prokaryotic reverse
transcriptase to be discovered [–]. The discovery of reverse
transcriptase in bacteria raises questions regarding the origin of
this enzyme. The reverse transcriptase (RT) consisting of several
conserved regions common to all retrons, can thus be used for a
comprehensive evolutionary analysis of retrons. To solve a
question regarding the origin of retron encoding ret (reverse
transcriptase) gene, we have compared the retro-element
reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences in different bacteria. The
phylogenetic trees constructed from this present study provide
a framework to appraise possible hypothesis for the origin and
evolution of different categories of retrons present in different
organisms. We have taken Eubacteria and Archaea for
screening purpose to see an evolutionary relationship between
these two domains of life on the basis of there ret (reverse
transcriptase) genes.

Methodology:
Sequence Retrieval:
The amino acid sequences of reverse transcriptase (RT) and the
nucleotide sequences of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) such as
Archaea: Methanosarcina species: (M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and
M.mazei); Eubacteria: Yersinia species (Y.frederiksenii, Y.pestis);
Myxobacteria species (S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca,
N.exedens and M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae,
V.parahaemolyticus and V.mimicus); Salmonella Typhimurium;
and Escherichia coli species (Strains 161,110, RT-Ec73 specific
Enterobacteria phage phiR73, ECOR70, ECOB, ECOR35 and
ECOR58)- were retrieved from ExPASy proteomics server
(http://expasy.org/). In addition, the 16S ribosomal RNA (16S
rRNA) nucleotide sequences of Archaea: Methanosarcina species
(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei) and Eubacteria: Yersinia
species (Y.frederiksenii and Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species
(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens and
M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and
V.mimicus); S.Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli K-12 were
retrieved from the KEGG organism database, Japan
(http://www.genome.jp/).

Generation of Gene and Phylogenetic Trees:
Identical conserved regions of reverse transcriptase (RT) amino
acid sequences of Archaea: Methanosarcina species:
(M.acetivorans, M.barkeri and M.mazei); Eubacteria: Yersinia
species (Y.frederiksenii, Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species
(S.cellulosum, M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens and
M.xanthus); Vibrio species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and
V.mimicus); Salmonella Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli species
(Strains 161,110, RT-Ec73 specific Enterobacteria phage phiR73,
ECOR70, ECOB, ECOR35 and ECOR58) scored in the alignment
constructed by using (CLUSTALW)
(
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) 
[] were used
to generate a gene (ret) tree. The sequence alignment was
performed under default conditions and the gene tree was
constructed by the neighbor-joining [] and distance matrix
methods. The poorly aligned N-terminals and C-terminals
sequence of alignments and also the internal gaps residue were
taken off from the alignments to make a precise evolutionary
tree by using the Jalview program []. The phylogenetic tree of
16S ribosomal RNAs of those organisms was also constructed
based on their nucleotide sequences by using (CLUSTALW)
(
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) 
[].

Results and discussion:
Comparative Study of Multicopy Single-Stranded DNA (msDNA) Structures
Recently, we have perceived that a new msDNA-Yf79 exist in
Yersinia frederiksenii ATCC 33641 contig01029 cell types and
compared it's properties to that of St-85, Vc-95 and Vp-96 
[].
However, the present study has revealed the close relatedness
of this msDNA-Yf79 with msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83 from
E.coli strains 110, 161 respectively () 
[,
]. These
msDNAs shared a number of highly conserved nucleotides in
their DNA-RNA complex sequences (). The sequence
5'-TAGA-3' box was conserved in msDNA-Yf79 [], msDNASt85
[], msDNA-Vc95 
[] and msDNA-Vp96 (Shimamoto T,
2003, unpublished data) (). The box 5'-TTGA-3'
was conserved in msDNA-Ec78 and msDNA-Ec83 [,
]. The
conserved tetra nucleotides (5'-TTGA-3') would play an
important role in the recognition and cleavage of msDNA by a
hypothetical enzyme []. Furthermore, the second nucleotide
thymine (T) was substituted by adenine (A) in the 5'-TAGA-3'
box of msDNA-Yf79 [], ­St85 
[], ­Vc95 
[] and ­Vp96
(Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) (). The
third nucleotide guanine (G) in the two boxes of all msDNAs is
conserved () and indicates the higher efficiency of
cleavage of these msDNAs, because when the guanine (G) at
the third position change to cytosine (C), the effort of cleavage
is moderately reduced []. In addition to these boxes, the fifth
nucleotide adenine (A) at the 5' end of DNA part of msDNAYf79
[] and msDNA-Ec83 
[] () may become
a target, because when this adenine (A) was substituted by any
pyrimidines, it reduces the overall msDNA accumulation [].
Within conserved nucleotides among all msDNAs ()
the nucleotide cytosine (C) at position 67 of msDNA-Yf79 []
was substituted by thymine (T), and thymine (T) at position 96
of msDNA-Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) was
substituted by cytosine (C) (). Furthermore,
msDNA-Ec83 [] seems to be mutagenic 
() because
msDNA with any mismatched base pair in their DNA stems
could be mutagenic [,
]. However, other remaining
msDNAs () contained no such type of mismatched
base pairing in their DNA stem structures.

Evolutionary Relationship of RTs from Pathogenic Bacteria
To explore the evolution of reverse transcriptases (RTs), the
phylogenetic analysis was performed among RT amino acid
sequences. Result exhibits a fundamental diversity among all
the reverse transcriptases (RTs) as RT-Yf79 (Y. frederiksenii) []
is closely related to the RT-Ec83 (E.coli strain 161) [] rather than
to the RT-Ec78 (E.coli strain 110) [], RT-Vp96 (V.
parahaemolyticus) (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), RTVc95
(V.cholerae) [] and RT-St85 (S.Typhimurium) 
[]. RTEc78
(E.coli strain 110) [] is closely related to RT­Vp96 (V.
parahaemolyticus) (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) as well
as RT-Vc95 (V.cholerae) [] is closely related to the RT-St85
(S.Typhimurium) [] 
(). The msDNA-Ec73 specific RT
(Enterobacteria phage phiR73) [] is related to RT-Yf79, ­Ec83, ­
Ec78, ­Vp96 (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), ­Vc95 and
­St85 [,
,
,
,
]. 
Although RT-Ec83, -Ec78 and -Ec73 [,
,
] were from Escherichia species, they spread out from a
central point (). Similarly, RT-Vc95 
[] and RT-Vp96
(Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data) were from Vibrio
species, but they are closely related to RT-St85 [] and RT-Ec78
[], respectively (). It was also observed that the high
similarity and relatedness of all RTs from Archaea species and
RT-S.cellulosum (Myxobacteria species) [] is originated from
Archaea RTs (). RT (V. mimicus) (Shimamoto T, 2003,
unpublished data) is closely related to the RT-S.cellulosum
(Myxobacteria species) [] and RTs from Archaea species
(). In addition, RT (Y.pestis) was descended from RTs of
V. mimicus (Shimamoto T, 2003, unpublished data), S.cellulosum
[] and Archaea species (). The remaining RTs
(Myxobacteria species) [] are related to RT-Ec107, ­Ec86 and ­
Ec67 [,
]. Among all RTs (Myxobacteria species) 
[],
especially RTs ­ M.lichenicola and S.aurantiaca 
[] have shown
higher similarity, as their phylogenetic distance is too low
(). Surprisingly, all the Eubacteria RTs are diverged
from the Archaea species (). Although RT-Ec48 is from
E.coli species [] 
this enzyme is distantly related with RTs of
Archaea and Eubacteria species ().

Genetic Diversity of msDNA Producing Strains
The phylogenetic tree based on 16SrRNA sequences of the
bacteria such as Archaea: Methanosarcina species (M.acetivorans,
M.barkeri and M.mazei) and Eubacteria: Yersinia species
(Y.frederiksenii and Y.pestis); Myxobacteria species (S.cellulosum,
M.lichenicola, S.aurantiaca, N.exedens and M.xanthus); Vibrio
species (V.cholerae, V.parahaemolyticus and V.mimicus);
S.Typhimurium; and Escherichia coli K-12 form a
phylogenetically related clusters or subgroups (). The
phylogeny tree revealed that four of the five major phylogenetic
groups produce msDNAs perhaps acquired this ret gene during
their evolution through vertical descended rather than
horizontal transformation. This observation is consistent with
the hypothesis of Rice and Lampson (1995) [].

Perspectives
This study manifests that, the ret genes commonly perceived in
Eubacteria are unique compared with ret genes found in
Archaea. Eubacteria ret genes of diverse types are probably
widespread and might be descended from the characteristics of
the Archaea world. This hypothesis is supported by the
prevalence of distribution of ret genes, among a wide variety of
organisms as documented here and in previous reports [,
].
Xiong and Eickbush (1990) also have shown the origin and
evolution of retro-elements in different organisms based upon
reverse transcriptase sequences []. Though Archaea had been
grouped with bacteria as prokaryotes (archaebacteria), they
have an independent evolutionary history. With respect to the
observation of ret genes in Archaea, the observation suggests
that the RT enzyme played a role in the evolutionary emergence
of Eubacteria from Archaea (or vice versa). Furthermore,
reverse transcriptase (RT) is also frequently found in
retroviruses like Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) [].

Now these findings raise questions as to where ret gene
originates? Why are they so diverse along with retron elements
in these organisms? This statement is parallel to the popular
chicken versus egg puzzles theory.
