Background
Since olden days, plants are used to treat many ailments. India has about 45,000 plant species and several thousands have been claimed to possess medicinal 
			properties. [] Medicinal plants used to treat hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic conditions are of 
			considerable interest for ethno-botanical community as they are recognized to contain valuable medicinal properties in different parts of the plant and a 
			number of plants have shown varying degree of hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic activity. [] The 
			active principles of many plant species are isolated for direct use as drugs, lead compounds or pharmacological agents. [] Several species of medicinal plants are used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, a disease affecting large number of people 
			world-wide. Traditional plant medicines or herbal formulations might offer a natural key to unlock diabetic complications. []

Diabetes mellitus is the major endocrine disorder [] responsible for renal failure, blindness or 
			diabetic cataract [], poor metabolic control [], 
			increased risk of cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis and AGE (advanced glycation end) products. [
			] Antioxidants play an important role to protect against damage by reactive oxygen species and their role in diabetes has been evaluated. Many plant 
			extracts and products were shown to possess significant antioxidant activity. [] Hence, we created 
			DiaMedBase, a diabetes literature database of medicinal plants with abstract, plant parts, objective and a ‘disease link’ to diseases other 
			than diabetes for each medicinal plant.

Methodology
Construction of DiaMedBase
DiaMedBase is constructed using html and can be accessed at 
             http://www.progenebio.in/DMP/DMP.htm. Data were collected from various literature sources such 
			as, PubMed [], ScienceDirect [], Mary Ann 
			Liebert [], BlackWell Synergy [], 
			IngentaConnect [], Scirus [], Bentham 
			Publishers [], Wiley journals [] and others. 
			DiaMedBase includes 742 records, containing about 309 genus and 389 species of plants described to possess medicinal properties against diabetes. The complete 
			list can be found at 
            http://www.progenebio.in/DMP/listz.htm. However, the list is not complete. They are provided alphabetically and the records are organized 
			to simplify the task of finding relevant data for any plant. The database can be accessed alphabetically using genus name for information on specific plants.

Features of DiaMedBase
Each entry in DiaMedBase is provided with a unique accession number DMPXX001, where, XX represents the first letter of genus and species, respectively. 
             Digits refer to the record number in the database. For example, the accession number of Aloe vera is DMPAv042, where, 042 represent record entry in the 
             DiaMedBase. The Medicinal Plant row in some records display a list of medicinal plants and the representative plants are highlighted. DiaMedBase contains 
             30 entries for genus Trigonella, 22 entries for Momordica, 19 for Gymnema, 13 entries for Opuntia and Panax, 11 for Allium species and 10 each for Aloe, 
             Tinospora, respectively. A screen-shot of the DiaMedBase is given in . Of the collected data, 36% whole plant, 
             26% leaves, 12% seeds, 10% roots, and 4% fruits. The characteristic feature of DiaMedBase is ‘Disease Link’, provided in each record displays 
             the list of diseases other than diabetes as a pop-up window indicating the importance of medicinal values of plants.

Utility
DiaMedBase emphasizes the importance of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic properties possessed by medicinal plants. The database finds utility to the scientific 
			community for a quick review on the number of plants and plant parts for diabetes medicinal plant research.

Future development
Continuous updates shall be released to include other plants of medicinal value periodically. The present access method shall be upgraded to browse records 
			on the studied plant parts. We plan to develop provisions to search the database to identify plants of interest using keywords.
