Background
One of the most common and globally important problems of
cereal breeding is Fusarium root rot (FRR) and Fusarium crown
rot (FCR) diseases [–
]. In the development of these diseases, a
fungi complex consisting of Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium
pseudograminearum (Syn: Fusarium graminearum), Microdochium
nivale (Syn: Fusarium nivale), Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium
acuminatum, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Gaeumannomyces graminis and
other species plays a major role []. The surveys carried out in
Turkey showed that F. culmorum was the most abundant
among these fungi []. In order to reduce the use of pesticide in
farming and struggling with the disease, it is crucial to
investigate the mechanisms of natural resistance 
[].
Investigation of resistance at the molecular level involves
mapping of quantitative trait loci [] and identification of
resistance genes []. On the other hand, induction of genes from
several pathways after pathogen infection strongly indicates
their relation to the plant defense system [].

Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) database is a collection of
short-single sequences of cDNA copies of mRNA that are
expressed under different conditions. ESTs represent part of the 
transcribed portion of the genome []. ESTs are a robust
resource (because of the relative simplicity and low expense for
their production) in structural and functional genomics. ESTs
can be used for gene discovery, genome annotations and
comparative genomics. Various EST sequencing projects have
been done to understand the transcriptome of genes associated
with biotic stress [–
].

Gene Ontology provides a structured and controlled
vocabulary to describe gene products according to three
ontologies, namely biological process, molecular function, and
cellular component []. Enzyme commission (EC) numbers are
hierarchical classification schemes for enzymes based on the
reaction catalyzed. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) is a database resource that integrates genomic,
chemical, and systemic functional information and has been
widely used for pathway mapping [,
]. In this study, we
analyzed two libraries of ESTs derived from barley roots
infected with Fusarium culmorum KF 350 
[]. These libraries
were established with Nickel and Carola cultivars grown for 7
days, then their roots were harvested 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours
post inoculation (HPI). Results may help to identify key factors
in stress response in barley after infection by F. culmorum and
provide additional information regarding their roles under
biotic stress.

Methodology
EST Source:
A total of 2306 ESTs from two EST libraries LIBEST_016901 and
LIBEST_016904 derived from F. culmorum KF 350 infected
Hordeum vulgare cv. Nickel and Carola root tissues from
GeneBank were used for bioinformatic analysis. Infection
process was performed on 7 day-old seedlings and root
samples were harvested in 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 HPI. ESTs were
downloaded in FASTA format for further analysis.

EST Processing:
VecScreen tool (
http: // www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen /) 
was used to find regions derived from vectors
and vector contaminations were manually removed. The clean
sequences were assembled into contigs and singletons with the
CAP3 program [].

Functional Annotation of ESTs:
Functional annotations were performed in 3 steps by using
Blast2GO 3.0.7 tool []. Firstly, contigs and singletons were
used as query in BLASTX searches against non-redundant
protein database (Blast DB: nr, Number of Blast Hits: 20, Blast
Expectation Value (E value): 1.0E-3) to find homologous
sequences []. For further analysis of ESTs, mapping was used
to retrieve GO terms as associated with BLASTX hits and
finally annotation (E-Value Hit Filter:1.0E-6, Annotation
CutOff:55, GO Weight:5, Hsp-Hit Coverage CutOff:0) was used
to associate with queries reliable information from GO, Enzyme
Codes, InterProScan, and KEGG databases.

Results &amp; Discussion
Analysis of EST libraries:
A total of 2306 ESTs, 1168 and 1138 from LIBEST_016901 and
LIBEST_016904 were downloaded in FASTA format. VecScreen
tool was used to remove contaminant sequences and 12
sequences were manually removed. The trimmed 2294 ESTs
were assembled into clusters by means of CAP3 program. 1034
ESTs were grouped into 359 contigs and 1260 ESTs represented
singletons.

Statistics of BLASTX results:
In order to assign a putative function, Blast2GO 3.0.7 tool was
used. All of the contigs and singletons were subjected to
BLASTX analysis for homology search. Afterwards, mapping
and annotation were performed. Data distribution of 1619 ESTs
were as follows: 52 sequences with blast hits, 125 sequences
with mapping and 674 sequences with GO-Slim annotation. 768
sequences were without blast hits and removed because of lack
of annotation. According to Top Hit species distribution of
BLAST Top-Hits, the majority of top matches were H. vulgare
368 (43.5%) followed by Aegilops tauschii (121), Triticum urartu
(96), Brachypodium distachyon (44), Zea mays (44), Triticum
aestivum (38), and Oryza sativa (29).

Enzyme commision numbers are a hierarchical classification
scheme for enzymes based on the reaction catalyzed. According
to EC classification, 94 sequences were transferases, 70
sequences were hydrolases, 68 sequences were
oxidoreductases, 15 sequences were lyases, 13 sequences were
isomerases, and 2 sequences were ligases. KEGG is a database
resource that integrates genomics, chemical and systemic
functional information and has been widely used for pathway
mapping. According to KEGG analysis, 369 sequences were
belonging to 264 enzymes and mapped to 83 different KEGG
pathways  (see supplementary material). KEGG
pathways included cysteine and methionine metabolism (12
enzymes), amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism (12
enzymes), and starch and sucrose metabolism (12 enzymes)
and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms (7 enzymes).
InterProScan tool was used to predict conserved domains in
corresponding translated protein sequence. InterProScan of
ESTs resulted in 1028 sequence of no InterPro, 591 sequences of
InterPro and 223 sequences of GOs.

According to GO Level distribution of ESTs, GO levels varied
from 1 to 11 and total number of annotations were 4448 (Term
Filter Mode: by Sequence Count, Term Filter Value:5). Based on
the gene ontology category in biological process, 157 sequences
were related to response to stress (GO: 0006950) while 76
sequences were associated with carbohydrate metabolism
(GO:0005975), and 74 sequences were related to cellular amino
acid metabolism (GO:0006520). In molecular function, 207
sequences were related to ion binding (GO: 0043167) and 70
sequences were related to oxidoreductase activity (GO:
0016491). With respect to cellular component ontology, the
subcellular localization of 160 sequences was plastid (GO:
0009536), for 148 sequences was plasma membrane (GO:
0005886), and for 113 sequences was mitochondrion (GO:
0005739). A Multi-Level Pie Chart representation was used to
display GO graphs ().

Conclusion
Root and crown rot disease is one of the most serious problems
for cereal breeding. Despite this fact, very little information is
available regarding the molecular mechanisms of such diseases.
In this study, we performed EST analysis in order to investigate
transcriptome during the early stages of colonization of barley
roots by F. culmorum. After evaluation of 2294 ESTs in a
F.culmorum-infected barley cDNA library, 157 response to
stress-related genes were identified. 264 enzymes were mapped
to 83 different KEGG pathways. These results allow to identify
a pool of stress and/or defense-related candidate genes. Primer
design against those genes will allow to assess comparatively
expression patterns of those genes in F. culmorum-resistant and
F. culmorum-susceptible barley cultivars.
