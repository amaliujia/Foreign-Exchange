Background
RNA is not just an intermediate between genes and protein as 
messenger RNA (mRNA) which is often described as a linear, 
unstructured sequence, uninteresting but also for the protein 
amino acid that it encodes. However, many non-coding RNAs 
exist which adopt sophisticated three-dimensional structures, 
and even some of these catalyze biochemical reactions 
[]. 


RNA folds hierarchically [,
]. At the first level of organization is the 
primary structure, which is the sequence of nucleotides. The next level 
is secondary structure, the base-pairing according to the Watson-Crick complementarity; 
A binds with U, G binds with C; but also the less stable combination G with U, called 
wobble base-pair. Tertiary structure is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms and 
the quaternary structure is the interaction with other molecules, which are often either 
proteins or other RNA strands. Secondary structure contacts are generally stronger than 
tertiary structure contacts and the formation of secondary structure occurs on a faster 
timescale than tertiary structure []. 
Therefore, RNA secondary structure can generally 
be predicted without knowledge of tertiary structure.  explains the hierarchy of 
RNA structure [].

RNA secondary structure consists of different structural 
elements. Part of RNA where no base pairs are found remains 
single stranded. When more than one base pair appears in the 
form of a group of contiguous base pairs, the resulting double 
stranded secondary structure is described as a stem. Bases that 
are attached with stems but do not base pair form loops. 
Simplest is the hairpin loop which consists of two 
complementary sequences joined by some non-pairing bases. 
An internal loop appears between two stems and may be 
symmetric or asymmetric (bulge). Another common secondary 
structure element is known as a multi-branch loop. It is a more 
complex structure that consists of several stem-loop type 
structures []. 


Some other secondary structure elements like pseudoknots, 
kissing hairpins and loop-bulge interactions are also present 
due to complementary base pairing. These elements are 
important in tertiary structure formation and are usually very 
difficult to predict. Most of the RNA secondary structure 
prediction tools do not allow pseudoknots in the structure and 
unable to locate them. 

The first method devised to predict RNA secondary structure 
was comparative sequence analysis []. This method infers 
base-pairs by determining canonical pairs that are common 
among multiple homologous sequences. Specific pairs are 
confirmed by the existence of compensating base-pair changes, 
where, for example, a GC pair in one sequence is replaced by an 
AU pair in another sequence. Comparative analysis is quite 
forceful when a number of homologous sequences are available. 
Over 97% of base-pairs predicted for ribosomal RNA were 
demonstrated in subsequent crystal structures. Comparative 
analysis has also been used to infer tertiary structure contacts. 
Comparative analysis, however, requires multiple sequences, 
can be time consuming and requires significant insights 
[].

To predict the secondary structure of a single sequence, the 
most popular approach is the dynamic programming. Two 
algorithms have mostly been used to predict [] secondary 
structure from single sequence. These are Nussinov maximum 
base pairing algorithm and Zuker free energy minimization 
algorithm. Both are based on dynamic programming. Dynamic 
programming is an algorithmic technique that organizes 
computations to avoid re-computing values that are already 
known, which can often save a great deal of time []. Problems 
having the overlapping sub-problems property [] are almost 
always solved using dynamic programming, a catch-all term for 
any algorithm in which the definition of a function is extended 
as the computation proceeds. This is generally accomplished by 
constructing a solution “bottom up” (e.g., progressing from 
simpler to more complex cases), the goal being to solve each 
sub-problem before it is needed by any other sub-problem 
[]. 
Now free energy minimization approach is mostly used for 
[] 
Wagner DB, predicting secondary structure with greater 
success [,
].

Because RNA structure determination is often experimentally 
difficult despite tremendous advances in RNA crystallography, 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and chemical 
modification, RNA structure prediction serves as an important 
tool for generating hypotheses about structure-function 
relationships in RNA. RNA structure prediction can be useful 
for interpreting or designing mutagenesis experiments, 
identifying conserved structural features and designing siRNA 
strategies []. 


RNA secondary structure can be described in many formats like 
dot-parenthesis format, .ct file format and RNAML (RNA 
Markup Language) format etc. but most common and simple is 
dot-parenthesis format which shows bases that forms base-pair 
as nested parenthesis and loops, and other bases as dots. In .dp 
file format, the first line describes the bases in alphabets (e.g. A,
G, C and U) and the second line shows the dot-parenthesis expression.

Today, there are many RNA secondary structure prediction 
tools available but most of these are either web-based or run 
only in UNIX environment.  (see supplementary 
material) summarizes some well-known RNA secondary 
structure prediction tools. Only a few are available for 
Microsoft Windows as [] “RNAstructure” 
[,
] but the 
output drawing is not very impressive. 


So, the need arises to develop the software tool, specific for Microsoft 
windows users, as there are many tools available for UNIX or other operating 
system users, with some graphical enhancements. Thus the aim and objectives for 
developing RNA-SSPT are: (i) To predict RNA secondary structure by just entering 
a single RNA sequence or from fasta file; (ii) To provide desktop software tool 
facility to a scientist in any version of Microsoft Windows (Windows XP or 
later version); (iii) To bring .NET technologies and C# language 
[] in the field of bioinformatics; 
(iv) Software in which there is [] 
facility to draw an already predicted structure that is in dot-parenthesis format; 
(v) To find pseudoknots using Nussinov algorithm; (vi) Software that also 
calculates the GC content in the sequence and percentage of each nitrogenous base. 
(vii) A better drawing environment than other renowned secondary structure 
prediction tools; (viii) To have user friendly interface so that every task 
should be performed on single click environment.

Methodology
The software developed for the prediction of RNA secondary structure was solely based on 
the information of single input RNA sequence. The development of software involved following steps:

Algorithm Used:
Nussinov dynamic programming algorithm was used for 
predicting RNA secondary structure in the development of 
RNA-SSPT. For visualization of RNA secondary structure from 
dot-Parenthesis expression to secondary structure, NAView.c 
program [] was converted into NAView.cs. Some help was 
taken from Naview.java in the VARNA tool (a java based RNA 
secondary structure display tool) by []. NAView.cs takes 
input in the dot-parenthesis format and calculates the 
coordinates of each base of input sequence. 


Nussinov algorithm implementation:
Base pair maximization is the simplest approach to predict the 
secondary structure of RNA. Testing and scoring each possible 
structure is numerically impossible so dynamic programming 
must be used for an efficient solution. In 1978, Nussinov 
[] 
published a method to do so. The basic mathematical recursive 
function for the matrix fill, of an RNA string containing N 
nucleotides is given below: (Please see  
for equation).

In the above described manner, a two dimensional array is 
filled recursively. Then this matrix was traced back to find the 
best optimal folding containing maximum base pairs. 
 shows the matrix B(i, j) for a sequence GGGAAAUCC after 
initialization, after the recursive fill, and after an optimal 
structure with three base pairs has been traced back. 


To run this recursion efficiently, the scores B(i, j) were tabulated 
in a triangular matrix. Initialized on the diagonal; subsequences
of length 0 or 1 have no base pairs, so B(i, i) = B(i, i − 1) = 0 (by 
convention, the i, i − 1 cells represent zero length sequences; the 
recursion must never access an empty matrix cell) then worked 
outwards on larger and larger subsequences, until reached the 
upper right corner, as shown in the bottom of .1. This 
corner is B(1,N), the score of the optimal structure for the 
complete sequence from i = 1 to j = N. Then, from that point, 
recovered the optimal structure by tracing back the optimal 
path that got us into the upper corner, one step in the structure 
at a time.

Simple energy minimization:
Maximizing the number of base pairs as described above does 
not lead to good structure predictions. Better predictions can be 
obtained by minimizing the free energy for an RNA sequence. 
Reasonable values for e at 37°C are −3, −2 and −1 kcal/mol for 
base pairs C − G, A − U and G − U, respectively. Using this we 
generalize the Nussinov algorithm such that the free energy of a 
base pair is considered. In the algorithm e(i, j) is now used 
rather than the simple +1. Function e(i, j) generate energy values 
based on the base pairing found. Since the free energy of a base 
pair is negative the algorithm search for the structures with 
overall minimal energy. Thus the recursion formula is [,
] 
(Please see  for equation and 
explanation). 


Tools Used for Software Development::
(i) Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition 
(ii) Microsoft .Net version 2.0 
(iii) Microsoft Visual C# 

Sequence Diagram:
A sequence diagram is a kind of interaction diagram in UML, 
which shows how processes operate with one another and in 
what order. It is a construct of a Message Sequence Chart. 
Sequence Diagram of RNA-SSPT is shown in (). 


Interface Design:
Interface was designed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 using 
“System.Windows.Forms” class. Menu strip was dragged and 
dropped onto main form from tool box. Icon and Front image of 
main menu was developed in Macromedia Flash 8.0. Remaining 
coding was done in Microsoft Visual C#. 


Accuracy Testing:
The accuracy of RNA-SSPT was tested by the sensitivity and 
Positive predictive value []. Sensitivity is the percentage of 
known base pairs correctly predicted:
# of predicted pairs in predicted structure 
Sensitivity = × 100
Total # of pairs in the known structure
Positive predictive value is the percentage of predicted base 
pairs that are in the known structure:
# of predicted pairs in known structure 
Positive predicted value= × 100
Total # of pairs in the known structure 


Known Structures:
STRAND [] database provides a wide collection of known 
RNA secondary structures drawn from public databases, 
searchable and downloadable in a common format. Six different 
types of RNA sequences were taken for the STRAND database. 
The detail about those sequences is given in  (see 
supplementary material). These six sequences were used to 
calculate the accuracy of RNA-SSPT. 


Pseudoknot Prediction:
Pseudoknots in secondary structure of STRAND ID # 
PDB_00908 were also predicted with RNA-SSPT. For this, the 
pseudoknots were removed from the actual secondary structure 
and dots were used in their place. Then predicted them with 
RNA-SSPT and compared with actual secondary structure. 


Drawing Comparison:
“RNAstructure” is a windows-based software package for RNA 
secondary structure prediction and analysis. The drawings of 
RNA secondary structures of both RNA-SSPT and 
RANstructure 5.1 for same secondary structures were also 
compared to check whose result is graphically better 
 
(see supplementary material). These were used to test the 
accuracy of RNA-SSPT. PDB (www.pdb.org) is Protein Data 
Bank and Rfam [,
] is database for RNA families. 


Facilities Provided:
RNA-SSPT is a user friendly software, providing the user to 
input RNA sequence, and facilitating to open sequence in any 
text file or in a fast file. It enables the user to graphically draw 
RNA secondary structure by just entering its sequence and its 
known secondary structure in dot-parenthesis format. It 
calculates the sequence information like GC content etc. DNA
sequence can converted to RNA by using “TranscribetoRNA”. 
Sensitivity and Positive Predicted Values can also be calculated. 


Accuracy Results:
Accuracy calculation results of different RNA sequences of 
table 2 are given in the table 3. 


Comparison of pseudoknots:
STRAND ID # PDB_00908 also contains pseudoknots. Its 
pseudoknots were calculated by RNA-SSPT and compared with 
the actually known pseudoknoted secondary structure. The 
result of this comparison is shown in . 


Comparison of graphical outputs:
Comparison of graphical outputs of both RNA-SSPT and 
RNAstructure 5.1, which is also a windows-based RNA 
secondary structure prediction and analysis tool, for the same 
RNA sequence “GGGAACCACAUUUCAACA” is shown in 
. 


Discussion
RNA-SSPT is a user-friendly RNA secondary structure 
prediction tool which accepts RNA input in different forms 
either by keyboard input or by opening text files or fasta files. If 
the user has DNA sequence, the transcription option is available 
which converts DNA into RNA. It also predicts pseudoknots by 
reusing the same nussinov algorithm in a unique way. It 
compares the results of RNA-SSPT either in pseudoknot free 
secondary structure form or in pseudoknotted structure with 
known secondary structures in the database. 


RNA-SSPT is developed to detect the maximum occurring of 
base pairs in a single RNA sequence. Different types of RNA 
sequences of known secondary structure, taken from STRAND 
database, are used to test the accuracy of RNA-SSPT. The 
software performed quite well for these RNA data sets and 
showed good results for “Positive Predictive Value”. The 
sensitivity of RNA-SSPT is much higher which confirmed that 
base pair maximization approach must not be used solely to 
predict the exact secondary structure of a given single RNA 
sequence. 


The results produced by RNA-SSPT were encouraging, there are several 
areas where the program could be improved and work could be continued in 
many directions. The algorithm implemented, is not very efficient in 
correct prediction of secondary structures for larger RNA sequences. The 
Zuker Free Energy minimization dynamic programming algorithm 
[,
] can 
be implemented in RNA-SSPT to make it globally acceptable. As most of the 
applications of Zuker algorithm works only on UNIX operating systems or are 
web-based, the tool can make its place as being user friendly and windows-based.

The algorithm [,
] used for calculating coordinates of 
nucleotides is old but still used in most of RNA secondary 
structure prediction and drawing tools. RNA-SSPT also 
implements it, but there are some new vector based [,
] and 
planer drawing [] algorithms available which can be used in 
RNA-SSPT to make it better than most of secondary structure tools.

The salient features of present software are; the software is easy 
to use and it has friendly graphical user interface. This software 
is fast and works in a single click. All parts of RNA-SSPT work 
properly and give effective output. It also checks input and 
prompts user to enter valid sequence or secondary structure for 
comparison. Overall the predictive part of RNA-SSPT is error 
free.
