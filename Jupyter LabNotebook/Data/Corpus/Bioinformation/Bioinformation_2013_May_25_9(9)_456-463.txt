Background
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that is caused by blood
flukes (trematodes) and leads to chronic ill health. According to
the World Health Organization (WHO), it affects at least 240
million people worldwide and more than 700 million people
are at risk in endemic areas. The infection is prevalent in
tropical and sub-tropical areas among poor communities
having no access to potable water and adequate sanitation.
Transmission of infection occurs through snails (infesting water
bodies), which release the infective free swimming larval stage
– the cercaria; the latter enters the mammalian host directly
penetrating via a cutaneous route. The causative organisms of
this disease are species of the fluke Schistosoma- S. mansoni, S.
japonicum and S. haematobium, of which S. japonicum is the most
prevalent one []. Presently, ‘Multi-Drug-Administration’
(MDA), praziquantel in particular, is used to control
schistosomiasis. However, low therapeutic efficacies and sideeffects
limit the use of these existing drugs. Besides, no drug is
effective against both the juvenile and adult stages of the fluke
[]. Immunological studies of this infection do not reveal any
clear immune effector mechanism, based on which an effective
vaccine could be designed. Hence, the control of
schistosomaisis warrants searching for new drug targets that
can be effectively used to combat all developmental stages of
the parasite's life cycle in human or mammalian hosts [].

Induction of apoptosis is one of the most promising strategies
for drug development against many diseases. Therefore, it has
been considered attractive to target apoptosis for designing
novel therapeutics against cancer and other autoimmune
diseases [,
]. Moreover, activation of apoptosis can also serve
as a novel possibility of drug discovery addressing parasite
infections as well. Activation of apoptosis highly depends on
dimerization of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, which
are of three types: apoptosis initiators, apoptosis executioners
and inflammatory mediators. The apoptosis executioner
caspases (Caspase-3, -6, -7 and -14) remain in dimeric form even
in the inactive state, whereas the apoptosis initiator caspases
(Caspase-2, -8, -9 and -10) and inflammatory mediators
(Caspase-1, -4, -5, -9, -11, -12, and -13) form dimers in specific
conditions or remain as monomers in the cytosol []. The
activation mechanism of caspases highly depends on the
proteolytic cleavage and adoption of loop conformation in the
dimer state; each dimer has four surface loops (L1, L2, L3, and
L4) that create a groove for directly binding to their substrates.
During the process of dimerization an additional loop, called
L2', of one monomer comes into proximity with L2 loop of the
adjacent monomer [].

The structural arrangement of a dimer single unit resembles a
sandwich model with six-stranded β-sheets surrounded by five
α-helices (two on one side and three on the opposite). In a
dimer complex, β-sheets of dimer interfaces of both monomers
are arranged by an approximately 1800 rotation in such a way
that the dimer comprises twelve β-sheets contained in a core
surrounded by ten α-helices on nearly opposite strands of the
protein []. In protein-protein interactions, domains interact
physically with one another to adopt a proper conformation,
and thus are considered functional and structural units of a
protein, which perform a specific function and are
evolutionarily conserved at the sequence as well as the
structure level []. Therefore, domains sharing a functional
similarity should normally be conserved. However, if there is a
considerable sequence diversity of a particular domain, then its
geometrical arrangement can also be different, which, in turn,
may exhibit alterations in function and stability of the protein
structure []. Phylogenetic studies of caspases from worms to
humans reveal that caspases of worms, considered to be of a
primitive order, are highly diverse and different from those of
their mammalian hosts []. This diversity may affect their
dimer conformation at binding interfaces to adopt different
dimer conformation and their stability. Thus, Caspase-3 and -7
of blood flukes may emerge as potent drug targets []. In the
present study, we analysed the interacting domains of Caspase-
3 and -7 of Schistosoma spp at the sequence and structural levels
and performed the protein-protein docking for studying their
geometrical arrangement in the dimer state.

Methodology
Generation of homology model of Caspase-3 and -7 sequences of Schistosoma species:
Two Caspase-3 sequences (EMBL:CAX76583.1 and
ref:XP_002574296.1) from S. mansoni and S. japonicum,
respectively and two Caspase-7 sequences (ref:XP_002574645.1
and ref: XP_002580143.1) from S. mansoni were retrieved from
GenBank [], National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI). A total of only 62 and 22 3-D structures for Caspase-3
and Caspase-7, respectively were found from humans in
Protein Data Bank (http://www.pdb.org). Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)p [] was used to retrieve
template hits for homology modelling and only the human
caspase crystal structures could be mined for the initial 3-D
structure modelling. Sequence similarities and identities of
templates with corresponding schistosomal caspases are
outlined in  (see supplementary material). Pairwise
alignment of corresponding templates and targets
(supplementary material) showed some gaps, which adopted
loop structures during homology modelling. Initial 3-D models
were generated using automated homology modelling software
Modeler9v8 [] that generate a 3-D model by satisfaction of
spatial restraints. The models were further refined by loop
modelling, side chain modelling and energy minimization with
the aid of Modeler9v8, SCWRL-4.0 [] and Swiss-
PDBViewer4.0 Gromacs96 program [], respectively for
getting more optimized and energetically favoured structures.
Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES)
[http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/] and pKNOT v.2 web
server [http://pknot.life.nctu.edu.tw/] were used for
evaluation of the stereochemical qualities and protein knot in
the modeled structures [].

Protein-protein docking simulation:
The protein-protein docking simulation was performed twice
by RossettaDock Server to get the digested and undigested L2
loop dimer structures []. The server performs a local docking
search and also assumes that protein backbone conformations
typically do not change much upon association. Hence, it was
necessary that both protein partners be kept in the same
orientation as in their templates. The local perturbation
included ~ ±3 Å distance between the two proteins, ~ 8 Å
sliding of proteins relative to each other along their surfaces, ~
8° tilt and a complete 360° spin around the central axis between
the two proteins. The server initiated 1000 independent
simulations from this range of random positions.

Calculation of the involved amino acids in dimer interface:
The Protein Interaction Calculator (PIC) server was used for
tracing the interacting amino acids in the dimer complex 
[]
and the hydrophobic, hydrophilic and ionic interactions of
participating atoms were calculated in the main as well as side
chains either within the intra-chain or inter-chain of protein
structures utilizing solvent accessible surfaces based on
distance methods with default parameters.

Structural alignment and angles, distances and vector orientation calculations between regular secondary structures of the dimer interface:
For the structure-based sequence alignment of modeled
caspases of Schistosoma spp with those of human, MUSTANG
programs [] were used for the purpose of calculating the root
mean square deviation (RMSD) amongst modeled structures.
Orientation vectors of modeled α-helices and β-sheets as well
as crystal structures were calculated by an open source perl
script developed by Thomas Holder (www.pymolwiki.org).
Additional perl scripts were developed to calculate the angle
and distance between the two vectors.

Results &amp; Discussion
Parasite sequence identity and similarity:
In similarity search analysis, Caspase-3 sequences of S.
japonicum [EMBL: CAX76583.1] and S. mansoni [ref:
XP_002574296.1] shared 70% similarity between themselves.
However, the two available Caspase-7 sequences of S. mansoni
(ref:XP_002574645.1 and ref:XP_002580143.1) surprisingly
shared only 19% identity to each other despite belonging to the
same species  (see supplementary material). In human
caspases there is higher percentage of aromatic, hydrophilic
and positively and negatively charged amino acids as
compared to those in schistosomal caspases. However, with
regard to hydrophobic amino acids, the reverse is true 
(see supplementary material).

Modelling of structure and validation:
The residues in Caspase-3 and -7 of Schistosoma species were
found in allowed regions of the Ramachandran diagram and an
overall G-factor of 0.00, -0.01, 0.03 and -0.01 was found in the
accessions - EMBL:CAX76583.1, ref:XP_002574296.1,
ref:XP_002574645.1 and ref:XP_002580143.1, respectively 
( 
(see supplementary material). Force field energies were
calculated and are -1739.008, -7286.563, -2089.667 and 788.141
KJ/mol for the accessions EMBL:CAX76583.1,
ref:XP_002574645.1, ref:XP_002574296.1 and ref:XP_00258143.1,
respectively. All modelled structures are energetically favoured
and an overall G-factor quality approached zero, thereby
substantiating the fact that the modeled structures in the
present study are suitable for protein-protein docking studies.
Acceptable G-factor values in PROCHECK are between 0 and
0.5 for reliable structures, the best model being the one with
zero G-factor [].

Structure similarity and structure alignment:
There are some regions in the modeled structures that have
adopted different secondary structures from their respective
templates (). The average sequence length of different
secondary structural motifs is larger in EMBL:CAX76583.1
compared to ref:XP_002574296.1 of Caspase-3, and in
ref:XP_002574645.1 compared to ref:XP_002580143 of Caspase-
7, respectively  (see supplementary material). When
RMSD of modeled structures of Caspase-3 and -7 in Schistosoma
species were analysed with those of human templates, the
RMSD was found to be greater than 2.0 Å  (see
supplementary material). This observation revealed that
human caspases are structurally distant from schistosomal
caspases. Similarly, EMBL: CAX76583.1 and ref:XP_002574645.1
are evolutionarily distant from ref: XP_002574296.1 and
ref:XP_002580143.1, respectively (). Greater Cα RMSDs
(greater than 1.05 ± 0.002 and 1.55 ± 0.001 Å for orthologs and
paralogs, respectively) in homologous structures may affect the
binding affinity and stability of ligands []. Geometrical
changes (as measured by the local RMSD) of the active sites
also influence the ligand binding affinity among orthologs and
therefore, exhibit a postive correlation, with secondary motif
lengths in structural alignments [].

Protein-Protein Interaction simulation:
The loop-digested Caspase-3 and -7 were docked for obtaining
the homodimers. RossetaDock server provided the lowest
minimum energies containing ten dimer conformations for each
modeled structure (i.e., EMBL:CAX76583.1, ref:XP_002574296.1,
ref:XP_002574645.1 and XP_002580143.1) (see supplementary
files). Out of 40 dimer conformations, 8 (viz., job#8189-protein-
8 and job#8189-protein-9 dimer of EMBL:CAX76583.1;
job#8476-protein-4 and job#8476-protein-5 of
ref:XP_002574296.1; job#8443-protein-2, job#8443-protein-3,
job#8443-protein-4 and job#8443-protein-8 of
ref:XP_002580143.1 and job#8217-protein-8 of
ref:XP_002574645.1) were shown to have similar conformations
in proximity with human crystal structures and β-sheets of
interacting surfaces of both the chains (). Other
conformations (namely, job#8189-protein-2, job#8189-protein-3,
job#8189-protein-5, job#8189-protein-6 and job#8189-protein-7
of EMBL:CAX76583.1; job#8476-protein-0, job#8476-protein-3,
job#8476-protein-4, job#8476-protein-5 and job#8476-protein-6
of ref:XP_002574296; job#8443-protein-0, job#8443-protein-1,
job#8443-protein-6 and job#8443-protein-7 of
ref:XP_002580143.1) of the modeled structures had different
dimer structures, wherein helix-helix or helix-sheet domain
interactions were dominant at interacting surfaces and these
domains were closer to each other unlike interactions involving
only β-sheets in humans. With regard to Caspase-7, modeled
structure of ref:XP_002574645.1 (S. mansoni) along with all
dimer conformations did not bear any similarity with those of
other modeled structures of Schistosoma species or humans,
with the exception of one job#8217-protein-8, that exhibited
somewhat similar conformations to human Caspase-7. Of all
the conformations of this modeled structure, five (viz.,
job#8217-protein-1, job#8217-protein-3, job#8217-protein-4,
job#8217-protein-6 and job#8217-protein-7) showed a striking
similarity amongst themselves.

Differences in secondary structure elements in structural
alignment of 3-D modeled caspase structures of Schistosoma
species with their templates were found mostly at the protease
activity-performing sites (). In Schistosoma species the
catalytic sites of caspases are mostly made up of coiled
secondary structures, whereas the human caspases comprise
both β-sheets and coils. The solvent accessible surface areas of
regular secondary structures (i.e., α-helices and β-sheets) are
more in occurrence as compared to coiled secondary structures.
Similarly, backbones of regular secondary structures follow a
specific arrangement unlike in coiled structures. Hence, the
presence of an irregular secondary structure at a catalytic site
may have some effect on their binding affinity and cleavage
activity [].

In case of ref:XP_002574645.1 modeled structure, interestingly
glycine is at the 107th position amidst 2nd and 3rd motifs and the
231 to 257 region reflects regular occurrence of glycine and
proline at the 239th and 246th position, respectively. Previous
analyses support destabilization of the β-sheet by glycine and
proline, which is why the 4th motif is a coil (i.e., which actively
participates in dimer formation), whereas in the template the
corresponding region is a β-sheet [].

Although 3-D structures of caspase sequences of Schistosoma
species were modeled on the basis of human caspase crystal
structures (see ‘Materials and methods’), the dimer forms that
were predicted by RosettaDock server are not the same as those
of human caspases, thus tempting us to analyze the interacting
domains on the basis of three factors: 1) distance and angle
between interacting helices and β-sheets of Schistosoma
caspases, 2) arrangement of secondary structure elements on
the dimer interface, and 3) amino acid distribution at the dimer
interface. The angle between the β-sheet and α-helix, which
participate in dimer formation, is lesser than that in their
templates. The arrangement of secondary structure elements at
the dimer interface of EMBL:CAX76583.1, ref:XP_002574296.1
and ref:XP_002580143.1 is same as in their templates; however,
in ref:XP_002574645.1 in place of β-sheet in the dimer interface
there is a long loop. As predicted the solvent-accessible surface
area of β-sheets is more than that of loop/coil structures 
[].
Hence, there are more chances for a cavity being formed at the
dimer interface in XP_00257465.1 but not in other structures.
An analysis of amino acid distribution at the dimer interface of
parasite caspases exhibited more occurance of small amino
acids (i.e., glycine, alanine, valine, serine, threonine, proline
and cysteine) in schistosomal caspases compared to 1NMQ,
2J31 and 1K86 (caspases of human). The distance between β-
sheets and α-helices is almost the same in all the structures
except ref|XP_002574645.1 but the amino acid distribution was
not identical in human and Schistosoma species 
(). Due
to their high occurrence in schistosomal caspases, amino acids
having small side chains are not able to fill the distance
between the β-sheets and α-helices; therefore, a large cavity is
formed at the dimer interface contrary to human caspases with
high occurrence of amino acids with long side chains, which are
able to create bridges between α-helixces and β-sheets.
Therefore, during protein-protein docking simulation the
interacting α-helix of one partner acts as an interacting ligand
in the cavity created at the dimer surfaces of its counterpart.
Thus, either helix-helix or helix-sheet interactions are more
prominent than β-sheet-β-sheet interactions during dimer
conformations of Caspase-3 and -7 of Schistosoma species, which
are found to be different from human caspases.

Conclusion
On the basis of sequence identity and similarity Caspase-3 and -
7 of Shistosoma species can be considered homologs of human
caspases. The schistosomal caspases are unique in comparison
to those of their host in the following salient points: 1) At the
secondary structure level, schistosomal caspase active sites
have different secondary structural elements (combination of β-
sheets and coils) and these structural differences may affect
their protease activity. In XP_002574645.1 (Caspase-7; S.
mansoni) structure, the 244-248 region is a loop owing to
regular occurrence of proline and glycine amino acids; 2) A
large cavity with a rough surface formed due to the occurrence
of a large number of small amino acids in schistosomal caspases
at the dimer interface may be responsible for adopting different
dimer conformation structures during the protein-protein
docking simulation. Large cavities are in a way responsible for
increasing the interfacial atomic distance, thereby reducing the
dimer stability and, affecting apoptosis initialization; 3) At the
tertiary level, the caspase dimer formations in Schistosoma
species are governed by the nature of amino acids involved,
secondary structure elements of the interacting domains and
the angle and distance between the latter; 4) The dimer
conformations of helminth caspases, being different from those
of their host (human) would also have cavities with different
sizes and shapes at the dimer interface, which, in turn, would
alter their binding properties as well that seems promising for
design of molecules more specific to helminth caspase active
sites. Thus, the parasite executioner caspases may be exploited
as potent drug targets of chemotherapeutic use.
