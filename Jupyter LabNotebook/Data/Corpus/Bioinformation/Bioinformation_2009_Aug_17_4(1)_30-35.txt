Background
Influenza viruses pose significant challenge to both human and animal
health. Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection can cause
huge economic loss. Viruses of low virulence are changed to high
pathogenicity when they are circulating in the poultry population due
to high mutation rate in their genome []. The first outbreak of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus in humans occurred in Hong Kong in 1997.
Infection was confirmed in 18 individuals, 6 of whom died. Infections
were acquired by humans directly from chickens, without the
involvement of an intermediate host. The outbreak was halted by a
territory-wide slaughter of more than 1.5 million chickens at the end of
December 1997. Influenza A virus belongs to the viral family of
Orthomyxoviridae that have segmented, negative single-stranded sense
RNA genome constituting envelop virion [,]. Influenza A virus
causes epidemics and pandemics in mammals and birds. However,
aquatic birds are natural reservoir of these viruses [–]. The H5N1
sub-type is the only highly pathogenic avian viral sub-type that has
been documented to cause an outbreak of respiratory disease in
humans. Human influenza A virus preferentially binds to sialic acid
linked to galactose by alpha-2,6 linkages that are mainly found on the
epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract, whereas avian viruses
tend to bind to alpha-2,3 linkages that are found on duck intestinal
epithelium [,]. These differences may be important in limiting the
transfer of viruses between species. There is no evidence of human-tohuman
transmission to date [], because they cannot ‘hop’ easily
among humans. However, in future, this strain might acquire ability to
spread infection among humans, either by mutation or by reassortment
of genetic material with human influenza virus [].

Hemagglutinin (HA) is the principal antigen present on the viral
surface. It is the primary target for neutralizing antibodies and is
responsible for viral binding to host receptors, enabling entry into the
host cell through endocytosis and subsequent membrane fusion.
Earlier in silico studies predicted that HA of influenza A virus is
highly sensitive to mutations and hence it is significant for its
pathogenic nature [].Therefore, HA is an important target for both
drug and vaccine development. Although, 16 avian and mammalian
serotypes of HA are known, only three (H1, H2, and H3) have become
adapted in the human population. Five antigenic sites designated A to
E have been located on the hemagglutinin monomer in H3N1 subtype
[]. Evidence suggests that single amino acid substitution within
these five regions results in the ability of flu virus to escape immune
surveillance and to spread infections worldwide every year. In addition
to minor changes in the antigenic regions, major changes in the
antigenic regions have produced the extremely virulent strains that
caused the lethal flu pandemics in 1957 and 1968.

The localization and fine structures of two H5 antigenic sites have
been described []. Site 1 is an exposed loop comprising residues 140
to 145 (H3 numbering) that corresponds to antigenic site A of H3 []
and Ca2 of H1 [], and site 2 comprises two subsites, one (HA1
residues 156 and 157) that corresponds to site B in the H3 subtype []
and one (HA1 residues 129 to 133) that corresponds to
immunodominant site Sa of H1 subtype []. Thus, HA is an
important surface protein. Therefore, in this communication we have
compared human hemagglutinin protein of H5N1 influenza virus A
of 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong with homologous HA from nonhuman
sources for mutations involved in change of hydropathy-index.
Furthermore, in all strains of non-human origins, mutations in
antigenic sites, receptor binding site and appearance of additional
glycosylation site in HA have been identified which are important
source of pathogenicity of viral infection.

Methodology
Sequence analysis
The sequence of hemagglutinin of influenza A virus (bird flu virus)
A/Hong Kong/ 156/ (H5N1) from human source was analyzed in this
report. The protein sequence of HA is available at NCBI [] with
accession number [GenBank: AAC40508.1]. Protein protein Blast
(Blast NCBI Server) [] was performed at NCBI server, and only
97.46 - 99.46 % similar sequences of hemagglutinin of sub-type H5N1
were selected for the sequence analysis. The sequences of HA selected
in this study were given in Table 1 in .

In these sequences, signal peptide segment was predicted using Signal
P3.0 server []. The signal peptide segment was deleted from all
these sequences prior to aligning using ClustalW [] multiple
alignment tools available at Pole Bioinformatique Lyonnais Network
Protein Sequence analysis using weight matrix GONNET for proteins.
These alignments were then analyzed for differences in their amino
acids at specific positions. Hydrophobicity values were obtained from
the tool ProtScale at ExPASy choosing Kyte &amp; Doolittle
hydrophobicity scale []. Antigenic sites in proteins were predicted
using program Antigenic [].

Motif prediction
Glycosylation motif was predicted in all protein sequences including
A/Hong Kong/ 156/ 97 (H5N1) using Scan Prosite at Expasy Server
[].

Discussion
Sequence analyses and hydrophathy-index
In this study, sequence analyses of HA of human and non-human
sources showed differences in amino acid mutations at specific
positions. In all strains like AAF02306 AAF02309, AAF02304,
ABD14807, AAY56367 and AAO46801, V178→I178, C363→G363
and S365→A365 mutations were found conserved (Table 2 in ).
 The AAF02306 strain showed V178→I178
mutation, which resulted in the substitution of hydrophobic Val by
more hydrophobic Ile. The C363→G363 mutation result in the
substitution of more hydrophobic Cys by less hydrophobic and small
amino acid Gly. Similarly, in S365 →A365 mutation, hydrophilic Ser
is replaced by hydrophobic Ala. In AAF02309 strain besides above
three mutations, there was one additional mutation R162→K162. This
mutation is an example of synonymous mutation. In AAF02304 strain,
there are two more mutations, namely A156→S156 and K368→Q368.
Here hydrophobic Ala 156 was replaced by hydrophilic Ser 156,
contrary to this, in other there was synonymous mutation
(K368→Q368). Similarly, the strain ABD14807 has four additional
mutations. Mutation K368→Q368 was found common in ABD14807
and AAF02304 strains. The remaining three mutations in ABD14807
strain are A156 → T156, T320→Ala320 and N387→D387. In the
first mutation, there was substitution of hydrophobic Ala by
hydrophilic Thr and vice-versa in second mutation, therefore
hydropathy-index changed. In the last mutation, there was
replacement of Asn by Asp causing synonymous mutation. In
AAY56367 strain there are eight additional mutations. The
A156→T156 and N387→ D387 mutations were found common to
both ABD14807 and AAY56367 strains. The R35→K35 and
N94→D94 mutations are synonymous mutations. The I71→T71 and
L138→H138 mutations showed substitution of hydrophobic amino
acid by hydrophilic amino acid. Conversly, T263→A263 mutation
showed substitution of hydrophilic amino acid by hydrophobic amino
acid. Finally, N409→S409 mutation showed substitution of less
hydrophilic Asn by more hydrophilic Ser. Hence the hydropathy-index
decreased. There are eleven additional mutations in AAO46801 strain.
The mutations R35→K35, N94→D94, A156→T156, T263→A263
and N387→D387 are common to both AAY56367 and AAO46801
strains. In P217→S217 mutation, there is substitution of hydrophobic
Pro to hydrophilic Ser. Thus, the hydropathy-index decreased. The Val
80→G80 mutation shows substitution of more hydrophobic Val by
less hydrophobic and small amino acid Gly. Rest of the four mutations
is synonymous mutation. From above data, it is evident that
V178→I178, C363→G363 and S365→A365 mutations were found
conserved among all strains of HA. Further, it was also found that
those mutations which changes hydropathy-index of HA, is one
important source of pathogenesis of viral infection. The hemagglutinin
protein shows species dependent differences.

Antigenicity and receptor binding site
Table 3 (see ) shows the antigenicity profile
of human hemagglutinin (AAC40508). Three potential antigenic sites
in non-human hemagglutinin with high score are 171-182,543-549
and 28-141 (Table 4 in ). Rest of the
antigenic sites present in non-human sources are similar to human HA,
therefore these are not shown in Table 4 in .
The antigenic segment comprising residues 129 to 133 correspond to
immunodominant site SA of the H1 subtype []. Therefore, antigenic
segment (128-141) predicted by computer program (Antigenic) in
human HA is an important antigenic site. In all strains of non-human
origin, because of two mutations C363→G363 and S365→A365,
antigenic segment 361-366 was found missing. In AAF02306 strain,
Val 178 → Ile 178 mutation lies at the antigenic site predicted by
computer program (Table 3 in ). In
AAF02304 strain besides V178 → Ile 178 mutation , A156→S156
mutation also occurred that lies at the antigenic subsite of site 2(HA1
residues 156 and 157) which corresponds to site B in the H3 subtype
[]. Similarly, in ABD14807 strain V178 → Ile 178 and
A156→T156 mutations occurred in antigenic sites as mentioned
above. In AAY56367 strain, in addition to two conserved mutations
(V178 → Ile 178, A156→S156), two more mutations were observed
at the antigenic sites. They are mutations I71→T71 and L138→H138.
In AAO46801 strain, three more mutations N45→D45, V80→G80
and R140→K140 were found that lie at the antigenic sites (Table 3 in ). 
The above data conclusively showed that
there are mutations at the antigenic sites. Therefore, these strains will
escape antibody binding and viral neutralization. In HA the receptorbinding
site comprises three structural elements, namely an alpha-helix
(190-helix, HA1 188 to 190) and two loops (130-loop, HA1 134 to
138, and 220-loop, HA1 221 to 228). Interestingly, in AAY56367
strain mutation L138→H138 lies at the receptor-binding site in 130-
loop. Here, the receptor binding site also overlaps the antigenic site.
Therefore, this amino acid substitution (L138→H138) will influence
both the specificity of receptor recognition as well as antibody
binding.

Glycosylation site
There are seven potential glycosylation sites in human HA (Table 5 in ). Our sequence analysis data showed that
these glycosylation sites varied, both in number and location in
different HA subtypes (H1 to H14) and even among variants of the
same subtype. Similar conclusions have also been drawn in other
studies [,]. Experiment on the natural epidemic strain A
/VIC/3/75, which has new oligosaccharide at 63, binds antibody
produced against 1968 strain (two epidemic earlier) when grown in
tunicamycin and lacking the oligosaccharide at 63. This proves that
carbohydrate, which is host specific can mask surfaces of the HA from
the immune system []. Thus, the oligoscacharides present at
glycosylation sites in human HA (Table 5 in ) will mask portions of the surface of human hemagglutinin;
hence these regions will not be recognized by host immune system.
Because of mutations, A156→S156 and A156→T156, an additional
glycosylation site appeared at the amino acid position 154-157 in
AAF02304 (Table 5 in ) and ABD14807,
AAY56367, AAO46801 strains respectively. Since this glycosylation
site is present at the antigenic site, therefore it will mask the antigenic
segment of these strains. Hence, hemagglutinin of these viral strains
will be antigenically inactive and therefore will be resistant to
antibody binding and viral neutralization.

Conclusion
These results suggest that several factors contribute to the
pathogenesis of viral infection. For example mutations in HA which
changes hydropathy-index is one important source of pathogenicity.
Other important sources of antigenic variations are mutations at the
antigenic sites of surface viral protein hemagglutinin, addition of
glycosylation site at the antigenic site and mutation at the receptorbinding
site. Synthetic peptides vaccines, corresponding to these
antigenic sites should be synthesized to combat bird flu infection.
Thus, in silico approach can serve as an important tool in delineating
the disease pathogenesis.
