Background
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and  Kluveromycetes lactis  have several 
common features in galactose metabolism. The gene cluster comprising of 
GAL10, GAL7 and GAL1 genes, that codes for the enzymes galactose-1- 
phosphate (gal-1-P) uridyl transferase, UDP-galactose-4- epimerase and 
galactokinase respectively and  is common to both the yeast species as well 
as E.coli [–]. 
When galactose is present as sole carbon source of energy 
then these organisms employ Leloir pathway to utilize galactose. From the 
medium, galactose can be taken by the cells by different permeation 
systems regulated by three enzymatic reactions which are essential for the 
metabolism of  galactose as shown in  
[,
]. 

Gal10p consists of two enzymatic activities. It splits in to mutarotase and 
UDP galactose 4-epimerase activities []. These activities are the basis of 
catabolic reaction of galactose where mutarotase converts beta-D-galactose 
into its alpha form and galactose 4-epimerase catalyzes the reversible 
conversion between UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose []. Crystal structure 
analysis has revealed that the galactose 4-epimerase domain, encoded by 
the N-terminus domain of the protein, is separated from the C-terminal 
mutarotase domain by a simple Type II turn  []. Loss of Gal10p activity 
prevents cell growth when galactose is the sole carbon source  []. The 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae epimerase encoded by the GAL10 gene is about 
twice the size of either the bacterial or human protein but has nearly 
similar size as Gal10p of K.lactis [].

In S. cerevisiae Gal10p has a bifunctional role, but in most organisms the 
mutarotase and epimerase activities are conceded out by different proteins. 
However, the 3D structure of Gal10p protein from K. lactis is not known, 
although, sequence is available in public repository GAL10  K.lactis
(CAG98170.1). Therefore, we model the 3D structure of Gal10p using 
homology modeling approach. We furnish the modeled Gal10p to different 
functional site prediction servers like PINTS  [], 
PROFUNC  [] and QSITEFINDER 
[] to find putative interactive 
amino acid residues forassessment of their interaction with other GAL proteins.  We further 
determine the homology among the Gal10p from  S. cerevisiae, K. lactis
and  E.coli at both sequence and structure level. Finally, we find the 
interaction network of Gal10p from S. cerevisiae, K. lactis and E.coli and 
define the strength of interaction between different GAL proteins within 
the same organism by protein-protein interaction method which are 
required for the regulation of leloir pathway in galactose metabolism. 

Methodology
Input file
The protein sequences of Gal10p from S. cerevisiae, K. lactis and E.coli
(Gal10p (S.cerevisiae (NP_009575.1), Gal10p  K.lactis (CAG98170.1), 
Gal10p  E.coli (ACA78806.1)) were downloaded from the gene bank 
databases. The overall research work was divided into following steps
Development of model structure of Gal10p from K. lactis

Prediction of amino acid residues required for protein-protein interaction.

Finding evolutionary relationship among the Gal10p of S. cerevisiae, K. lactis and E.coli

 Generating putative protein interaction map among GAL proteins of K. lactis, S.cerevisiae and E.coli and estimate their interaction 
affinity.



Homology Modeling
Firstly, the protein sequence of Gal10p from  K. lactis was subjected to 
SWISS MODEL software for 3D model development  []. The  
shows details of homology modeling. Furthermore, the quality of developed Gal10p model was estimated via Procheck and ProSA 
(https:// prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php). 
(Note that the model structure will be generated only when the sequence similarity will be more then 
30%).

Model Optimization
The model was further optimized via energy minimization through 
GROMOS96, incoorporated in Swiss Pdb Viewer software. Additionally,
structure-structure superposition was performed to estimate model 
structure refinement. 

Protein functional sites
The model structure of Gal10p from K. lactis was subjected to functional  
site prediction servers like PINTS [], 
PROFUNC [] and Q-SITEFINDER 
[]. These servers envisaged the active site residues for Gal10p.

Comparative genomics study
The amount of sequence and structure similarity among the Gal10p from S. 
cerevisiae, K. lactis and E.coli were determined. The sequence alignment 
was performed via BLAST  []. Furthermore, the structural similarities 
between Gal10p were estimated by the swiss pdb viewer software [] via 
structure-structure superposition tool. In addition, Protein Interaction 
Network was generated for Gal10p from S. cerevisiae, K. lactis and E.coli
via STRING (version 8.2). Additionally, protein-protein interaction affinity 
was measured by Patchdock  [] software. Please refer  
 for overall methodolog.

Results
We obtained the 3D structure of Gal10p from  Kluyveromyces lactis by 
swiss model software  [] 
via homology modeling (). We 
subjected the protein sequence of Gal10p through SWISS MODEL by 
using default parameters.  This software developed the 3D structure of 
Gal10p from K. lactis by using chain A of 1Z45 as the template protein 
whose 3D structure is known and submitted in protein data bank (Table 1).  
The template protein 1Z45 is Gal10p from  S. cerevisiae.  The protein 
sequence of Gal10p from K. Lactis showed sequence identity of 54.191% 
and e-value of 0.00e-1 with 1Z45 protein (Gal10p of  S.cerevisiae). The 
modeled structure is made up of mixture of Helix and sheets ( see 
).  

Ramachandran plot analysis via procheck estimated the model quality and 
confirmed that overall accuracy of the developed model was 98.20% where 
majority of the  amino acid residues were in favored [A,B,L]+ additionally 
allowed [a,b,l,p] regions. The numbers of bad contacts per 100 residues 
were measured to be only one. ProSA-Web server analysis revealed that 
the modeled structure occu]pied region of  X-ray predicted native protein 
structures of same size with Z score of -9.78  (). Energy 
minimization by Gromos96 (Via Swiss Pdb Viewer) stabilized the Gal10p 
modeled structure from energy of 3281.895 KJ/mol to -23676.174 KJ/mol.  

The structures of Gal10p (Epimerase enzymes) from (Modeled structure) 
K. lactis, Gal10p (1A9Z) from  E.coli and Gal10p (1Z45) from  S. 
cerevisiae were subjected to functional sites prediction serves like 
PINTS(12), PROFUNC(13) and Q-SITEFINDER(14) for finding of 
putative active sites residues domain.   The DALI server provided 
significant match for Gal10p from  K. lactis with 1Z45 (Z score 60.5, 
RMSD=0.7).  DALI server template pdb also matched with the SWISS 
MODEL. The functional site prediction servers predicted following active 
site residues in Gal10p of E.coli Tyr11, Ile12, Tyr177, Lys84, Ala9, Gly10, 
Phe80, Ser122, Gly7, Lys153, Ser123, Pro180, in Gal10p (1Z45) of  S. 
cerevisiae  Asn445,  His471,  Tyr435,  Ile36,  Lys108,  Tyr205, Phe104,  
Gly31, Ser146, Ser147. Gly34.  Pro208, Tyr22, Ile23, Asp42, Asn43, 
Leu44, Ser45, Asn46, Ser47, Leu70, Phe91, Asn110, Ser135, Tyr163, 
Lys167 and in Gal10p of K.lactis Tyr15, Ile16, Tyr184, Phe84, Ser126, 
Ser127, Lys88, Gly14, Pro187, Gly12, Gly11, Tyr156, Lys160 with 
significant match. The functional sites predicted by Q-SITEFINDER  []
server also matched with the Profunc server. The sequence (by BLAST 
method) and structure (by swiss pdb viewer method) similarity have been 
estimated between the Gal10p of  S.cerevisiae, K.lactis and  E.coli. The 
Gal10p from S.cerevisiae (1Z45), K.lactis and E.coli (1A9Z) did not show 
any nucleotide sequence similarity with each other but the protein 
sequence produced significant sequence similarity with each other. The 
Gal10p protein of S. cerevisiae produced sequence identity of 56% and 
evalue of 0.00, score 799 with Gal10p protein of K. lactis. But in case of 
matching with E.coli Gal10p the sequence identity was 49%, e-value 6e-
97, score 337 which is less then homology of Gal10p of S. cerevisiae with 
Gal10p of K. lactis. Gal10p of K. lactis with Gal10p of E. coli produced 
sequence identity of 47%, e-value 3e-89, score 311. The protein sequence 
identity was also reflected by Dot matrix plot where among all Gal10p 
proteins, the Gal10p of S. cerevisiae and Gal10p of K. lactis are diagonally 
align with each other ().  

We have done the structure-structure superposition by swiss pdb viewer 
and calculated the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) value for finding 
the structure similarity among Gal10p proteins.  Superposition of Gal10p 
of S.cerevisiae produced low RMSD with the Gal10p of K. lactis (RMSD = 0.28Å) 
as compare to Gal10p of E.coli (RMSD= 0.98 Å) and between 
Gal10p of K. lactis &amp; Gal10p of E.coli RMSD was 1.03 Å 
( see ). We have obtained the putative protein-protein 
interaction network for Gal10p proteins in S. cerevisiae, K. lactis and E. 
coli via string (version 8.2) (http://string.embl.de/) 
software (15)  (). 

The D-galactose pathway is regulated by several proteins which are known 
to  interact  with  each  other  and  regulate  the  synthesis  of  galactose 
metabolizing enzyme. The Gal10p may also interact with its nearest 
proteins to carry out its function therefore we determined the affinity 
between the Gal10p with other GAL proteins present in the  K. lactis , 
S.cerevisiae and  E.coli.  In order to estimate the strength of interaction 
affinity between the Gal10p and other Gal proteins within genome of  S. 
cerevisiae, K. lactis and E. coli, we used patchdock software for proteinprotein 
interaction study. Before estimating the interaction, we also 
developed the modeled 3D structures of Gal1p, Gal3p, Gal4p, Gal7p, and 
Gal80p by SWISS MODEL software for S. cerevisiae, K.lactis and E.coli
( see ). The Gal10p of  S.cerevisiae
produced greater affinity for its Gal3p protein with patch dock score 18718 
as compared to its other Gal proteins  (see ). 
On the other hand, Gal10p of K.lactis produced greater affinity 
for its Gal7p with patch dock score 14986. The Gal10p of E. coli 
showedgreater interaction for Gal1 (galK) with patchdock score 16562 
(see ).  

Discussion and Conclusion
Gal10p is an UDP-Glucose 4-epimerase enzyme which participates in 
Leloir pathway of D- Galactose metabolism. We determine the 3D 
structure of Gal10p of  K.lactis via comparative homology modeling 
method. This is the first report to ascertain the putative structure of Gal10p 
from  K. lactis. Once the structure is there we can prognosticate the 
functional residues and the putative interactive partners along with their 
strength of affinity. These studies will help in understanding the 
mechanism of action of Epimerase protein. At the same time this 
information can be used in Biotech industries where Gal proteins are using 
for protein productions or designing some drugs. Our 3D model may help 
the biologist to understand the role of Gal10p in  K. lactis galactose 
pathway in a better way. Even we also deduce the comparative genomics 
study by using the model 3D structure and confirm that S.cerevisiae and K. 
lactis Gal10p are sharing the common features. Furthermore, the functional 
site prediction in Gal10p of K. lactis helps in protein-protein interaction 
analysis and provides information about the residues involved in mutual 
interaction with other GAL proteins within the genome of K.lactis. This 
study will help in improving the knowledge about the mechanism of GAL 
proteins interactions and may provide useful insight in the regulation of 
Galactose pathway. The above studies may be applied to Human Gal10p, 
where it can help in gaining useful insight into Galactosemia disease. The 
protein-protein interaction studies provided by us may find application in 
industry where GAL pathway is used for protein production.
