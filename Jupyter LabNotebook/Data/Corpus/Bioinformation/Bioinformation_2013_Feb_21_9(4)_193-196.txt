Background
Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor in various
vascular diseases []. More than 100 epidemiological, casecontrol
and longitudinal cohort studies have established that
even mild hyperhomocysteinemia predicts and precedes the
development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and is
an independent risk factor for cardio- and cerebrovascular
diseases []. Mean homocysteine (Hcy) levels increase
throughout life by 3-5 µmol per liter and the level is higher in
men than in women. Moreover, each 5 µmol/L increase in tHcy
is associated with increased risk of vascular arteriosclerotic
disease [].

Increased levels of plasma homocysteine may be caused by
several factors such as genetic polymorphism, deficiency of/
disturbed distribution/increased catabolism of cofactor(s) 
[].

Moreover, there is often a cluster of factors including age &amp;
gender, genetics, vitamin status, lifestyle and ageing, etc.
leading to hyperhomocysteinemia. The most frequent causes
are an unhealthy lifestyle, low intake of vitamins,
gastrointestinal malabsorption of vitamins, enzymatic defects
and drug interactions. Folic acid, vitamin B12 and pyridoxine
are the essential co-factors in Hcy metabolism are known
determinants of plasma Hcy concentrations [,
]. It is well
established that, deficiency in homocysteine lowering vitamins
such as, vitamin B12, folic acid and pyridoxine [–] is the
dominant cause of hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, several
studies have reported that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) polymorphism is also a risk factor causing
hyperhomocysteinemia and associated complications [,
].
There is an increasing mutation in the MTHFR C677T gene
polymorphism in Indian population []. Previously,
prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in India has been
reported in young Asian Indians [], adolescent population
[], western Indians 
[], in low socio-economic strata of north
India [] and in rural and urban areas of India 
[]. Although
vitamin B12 deficiency and MTHFR polymorphism have been
recognized in Indians for long period of time [], there is little
appreciation of this amongst Indian medical professionals and
policy makers. This may be due to a number of reasons: 1)
vitamin B12, MTHFR polymorphism and tHcy are not routinely
measured in clinical practice 2) the majority of previous reports
are clinic based and therefore may not represent community
prevalence. However, there is no study has been carried out in
upper economic class population. Because factors can be
potentially reduced in the elderly, it is important to carry out
epidemiologic studies of hyperhomocysteinemia. In this
background of widespread nutritional deficiency and MTHFR
polymorphism in Indians, we decided to estimate the
prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy Indian doctors.

Methodology
An observational, simple blind study was carried out in 1254
healthy Indian doctors (age, 46.59±13.05) (men, N=912 &amp;
women, N=342). All healthy subjects were evaluated on the
basis of a survey of symptoms related to coronary, cerebral, and
peripheral diseases. Subjects having any acute or chronic
disease were excluded from the study. Blood samples from
fasting subjects were obtained using EDTA as anticoagulant by
Super Religare Laboratories Ltd, India. Samples were
immediately chilled at &lt;4°C and centrifuged (2000 X g, 10 min)
within 1 h of collection. Plasma was immediately frozen at -
70°C until Hcy determination. Serum samples were obtained
and stored at -70°C until analysis. Total plasma Hcy levels were
determined by using the ADVIA Centaur® Immunoassay
System (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., Tarrytown, NY,
USA). Sensitivity and Assay Range was &lt; 0.50 – 65 µmol/L.
Statistical methods ANOVA, unpaired t test was used to
compare mean tHcy concentration in association with
demographic factors, including age, BMI and gender. Results
are expressed as mean ± SD/SEM if nothing else is specified.

Results
Demographic characteristics of the population are shown in
 (see supplementary material). Total plasma
homocysteine concentration was measured in 1243 samples
(men, N=906, &amp; women, N=337) of total 1254 doctors. Mean
Hcy concentration in total population of doctor was 19.67±11.25
µmol/L (range, 4.71 to &gt;65.00 µmol/L). Mean tHcy
concentration in men (n=879) was 21.96 ± 0.38 (95% CI, 4.73-
7.37; range 5.88 to 65.00 µmol/L). In 27 (2.98%) men
homocysteine level was &gt; 65 µmol/L was taken separately.

Mean tHcy concentration in women (337) was 15.90 ± 0.39
µmol/L (95% CI, 4.73-7.37; range 4.71 to 64.02 µmol/L). As it
was expected, the differences in tHcy between sexes were
statistically significant (P&lt;0.0001; 95% CI, 4.73-7.37; t=8.98;
df=1214). Men were found to have significantly higher
homocysteine levels compared to women. On the basis of Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) criteria, 11.4 µmol/L in men and 10.4 µmol/L in women
were considered as the cutoff values []. Using these cutoff
values for each age category, the prevalence of
hyperhomocysteinemia was found to be 92.85% among men
(&gt;11.4 µmol/L) and 81.60% among women (&gt;10.4 µmol/L).
Moreover, the gender differences in plasma tHcy concentrations
were present in the two major age groups. Plasma tHcy
concentrations were positively associated with gender and at
major age groups.  (see supplementary material) shows
the tHcy level in three different age groups in both the genders.
There was statistically significant higher tHcy levels in men
than women in 20-39 years (P&lt;0.0001; 95% CI, 8.59-14.67; t=7.50,
df=37) and 40-59 (P&lt;0.0001; 95% CI, 2.84-5.85; t=5.66, df=62)
years age groups (P&lt;0.0001). However, there was no
statistically significant difference in the age group of &gt;60 years
(P=0.61; 95% CI, -1.86-3.15; t=0.50, df=21).

Discussion
Because the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and
risk of vascular events is gradual and continual, and tHcy levels
are highly prevalent [,
], it is still difficult to establish
reference values. Recently, the NHANES III study 
[]
established that higher values (95th percentile) in a healthy
population with an adequate vitamin plasma level and without
renal insufficiency can be considered having
hyperhomocysteinemia. On the basis of these criteria,
hyperhomocysteinemia was defined for values higher than 11.4
µmol/L in men and 10.4 µmol/L in women.

Taking into account the values considered normal by NHANES
III in healthy population [], our study showed a very high
prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy upper
socioeconomic population. The proportion of
hyperhomocysteinemia in men 92.85% was significantly higher
than in women (81.60%). The prevalence observed in our study
is quite similar to the previously reported prevalence in Indian
subcontinent [,
]. In earlier reports, prevalence of
hyperhomocysteinemia was found to be 84% in healthy Indian
population living in urban north India [].

Several studies reported that plasma tHcy levels increase with
age, depending on nutritional and metabolic factors, and on
changes in vitamin B12 absorption and renal excretion. Folic
acid and vitamin B12 deficiency or MTHFR polymorphism is
considered the essential cause of high tHcy concentration 
[,
]. Moreover, vegetarianism and sedentary lifestyle are
important etiological factors. Vegetarianism in India is
multigenerational, lifelong and based on religious and cultural
beliefs. In India, striking hyperhomocysteinemia has been
commonly observed in markedly decreased intakes of folic acid
and vitamin B12 in the vegetarians and urban middle class
residents [,
]. Moreover, low plasma concentrations of
folate, vitamins B-12 and B-6, older age, being male, and living
in urban areas were all independently associated with elevated
tHcy, with low folate as the strongest determinant 
[]. In
addition, there is a high prevalence of the thermolabile variant
of the MTHFR enzyme in Indian population [], 
–]. There is
54.5% prevalence of MTHFR polymorphism in Indian
population []. These may be the possible reasons for high
prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in the present subset of
population.

In accordance with the previous report, prevalence of
hyperhomocysteinemia was found to be higher in men
compared to women []. This may be due to the fact that,
women had shown to be significantly higher remethylation
rates than did men (P&lt;0.005) and a tendency toward higher
transmethylation which may results into differences between
men and women in homocysteine concentrations [].

As stated earlier, hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk
factor for various cerebrovascular events. In the Rotterdam
study [], 
analyses carried out on a cohort of 7983 residents, all
older than 55 years at the beginning of treatment, showed
increases between 5% and 10% for the occurrence of different
vascular events per each 1 µmol/L tHcy increase. In a 4-year
follow-up, participants of the upper quintile with levels higher
than 18 µmol/L showed a significant increase of myocardial
infarction risk (odds ratio, 2.4; CI 95% 1.1–5.4) and
cerebrovascular accident (odds ratio 2.5; CI 95% 1.2–5.4) when
compared with those from the lower quintile with values less
than 12.0 µmol/L. In a recent analysis on 10-year mortality in
elderly people in Framingham, values of tHcy higher than 14.3
µmol/L were associated to a nonadjusted relative risk of
cardiovascular death of 2.2 (95% CI 1.7–2.8) in respect of lower
values [,
]. Considering the above data,
hyperhomocysteinemia may be the future risk for various
pathologies in the present subset of population.

In the present study, the higher prevalence of
hyperhomocysteinemia was observed in healthy upper
socioeconomic class population in India. Hence, further studies
to look at the plasma levels of folate and cobalamine and their
association with hyperhomocysteinemia are warranted to
prevent the future risk of vascular diseases.
