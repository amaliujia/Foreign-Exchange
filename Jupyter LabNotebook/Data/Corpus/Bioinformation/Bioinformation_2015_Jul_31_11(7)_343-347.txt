The nematode belongs to Thelastomatoidea, a group of pinworms that parasitizes only invertebrates. Currently, in India spp. of
this group are distinguished mainly on the basis of morphological characters that present possible confusions. Therefore, we
identified the species through morphological and genetic analysis. We selected mt Cox 1 gene region to show their phylogenetic
position with closely related spp. and confirmed their molecular validation. The present findings are important to confirm the
phylogenetic position and relationship among five nematode spp. and avoid misidentification regarding their validation, as it is
more necessary in that case when many species harbours the same host.

Background
Thelastomatoidea is one of the two superfamilies belonging to
order Oxyurida which include nematodes that parasitizes
invertebrate animals, mainly arthropod and live within the
hindgut of the host [1]. It includes family Travassosinematidae,
which have been reported worldwide [2–
10]. The
Travassosinematids are mainly found in mole crickets [11–
13].
So far, in India, Gryllotalpa africana prevalent [14,
15] including
other countries and morphological adaptations enable it to live
in a warm climate like in India. The mole cricket is
characterized by its brownish colour, shape of adult male
pronotum, trochanter, fore wing, transverse sclerite and
epiphallus. Although, G. africana is more closely related to G.
orientalis but can be easily separated from it by body color,
characters of posterior tibiae, forewing and base of transverse
sclerite. During a survey of entomopathogenic nematodes of G.
africana in Meerut (U.P.), India, five thelastomatoid nematodes
belonging to four genera were found. The five species belong
to genera, Binema [16], Chitwoodiella 
[17], Isobinema 
[18], and
Mirzaiella [17]. Morphological diagnosis of the species,
collected from the same host is very difficult because many of
the characters that serve to distinguish them, sometimes
overlap. In that case, where different species harbours same
host, morphological identification requires most reliable
characters. Identification of species using DNA sequences is
the base for molecular taxonomy. Therefore, the identification
of these five species needs to be favoured by molecular tools as
these are very useful for validation of nematode species 
[19–
21]. Regarding the spp. of Travassosinematidae, little attention
has been paid to use of mitochondrial genes despite the fact,
that mtDNA evolves very quickly in closely related species of
nematodes [22,
23]. It has been proved useful in phylogenetics 
because of its maternal inheritance and rapid rate of
divergence [24]. For phylogenetic relationships of nematodes,
mitochondrial genes have been frequently used [25,
26]
specifically Cox1 has been effective to resolve the phylogenies
[27,
28]. The mtDNA Cox1 gene sequence enables the
discrimination of closely allied species including the
nematodes [29]. This study is needed as it will help in the
further phylogenetic analysis of these different nematodes
species and also in resolving the existing taxonomic confusion
at genus and species levels. The finding of this study will also
form a base line for the subsequent workers on this group of
nematode systematics.

In this study, we obtained mt Cox 1 sequence data for five
nematode spp. collected from India to analyse the phylogenetic
position and relationships among nematode species.

Methodology
Sample collection and morphological study:
G. africana found in Meerut (U.P.), India (29° 01׳ N, 77° 45׳E)
were placed in individual vials in the field and dissections
were performed in laboratory under stereoscopic microscope
with the insects submerged in saline water in petridish.
Nematodes were collected from intestine of the host and were
fixed for morphology (in hot 70% alcohol) and molecular
studies (in 95% alcohol). For morphology, the nematodes were
first gradually cleared in glycerin and identified using a light
microscope equipped with differential interference contrast
and digital image analysis system (Motic digital microscope
for Windows) according to existing keys and descriptions.
Voucher specimens are deposited in Museum of the
Department of Zoology, Chaudhary Charan Singh University,
Meerut (U.P.), India.

Molecular methods:
Genomic DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer׳s
instructions. PCR was used to amplify the mt Cox 1 region
using primer LCO1490 (5׳-
GGTCAACAAATCATAAAGATATTGG-3׳) and HC02198 (5׳-
TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAAAAATCA-3׳) [30]. The PCR
reactions (in 25 µl) were performed under standard conditions
[31]. Subsequently, PCR products were purified using
PurelinkTM Quick Gel Extraction and PCR Purification Combo
Kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer׳s instruction.
Amplicons were sequenced (in both directions) using the Big
Dye Terminator version 3.1 cycle sequencing kit in ABI 3130
Genetic Analyser, Applied Biosystems with the same primers.
For nucleotide sequence analysis was done by using the
BLAST available in the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov). 
All sequences of nematodes
generated in this study were aligned and compared with one
another and with those sequences of Cox1 of other nematodes
available in the GenBank. The Cox 1 sequences of closely
related species were downloaded and used for further
analysis. Multiple sequence alignment were made with the the
Clustal W [32] implemented in MEGA 6 
[33] with default
parameters. DNA pairwise distances were calculated using pdistance
model.

Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analysis
were performed to determine the phylogenetic position of
analysed five species. The dataset was tested using MEGA 6.06
for the best fit nucleotide substitution model, shown Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) as one that best fits was chosen.
ML analyses were performed in MEGA 6 with GTR+G+I
model. To support topology, it was tested by bootstrapping
over 1,000 replications. A Bayesian inference (BI) analysis was
computed by Topali 2.5 [34]. The substitution models were
tested by the Bayesian Information Criterion and GTR+G+I
was chosen. Posterior probabilities searches for 1 000 000
generations via two independent runs of four simultaneous
MCMCMC chains with every 100th tree saved. The first 25% of
the sampled trees for each dataset were discarded as ‘burn in’.
The ML tree was visualised using the tree explorer of MEGA 6.
Enterobius vermicularis (EU281143) was used as outgroup in the
final alignment. The sequences of the Cox 1 mt DNA fragment
obtained were ranged from 589 to 700 bp submitted to
GenBank under the following accession numbers: Isobinema
flagellocerca (KM886108), Chitwoodiella ovofilamenta (KM886109),
Mirzaiella asiatica (KM886112), Binema ornata (KM886113) and
Binema korsakowi (KM886114).

Results &amp; Discussion
Travassosinematidae specimens analyzed in this study were
morphologically identified as I. flagellocerca, C. ovofilamenta, M.
asiatica, B. ornata and B. korsakowi. Measurements were taken
and compared with those described originally the species
Table 1 (see supplementary material) .In BLAST search, five
spp. studied showed all closest match with nematodes of the
family Pharyngodonidae, but none had closer than 85%
similarity. This low similarity observed, might be due to lack
of mitochondrial sequence data from the family
Travassosinematidae on database. The phylogenetic analyses
resulted with bootstrap values for ML and BI in tree. The
generated ML and BI represented similar topologies, therefore,
to depict the topology of tree, only ML tree is presented
(Figure 1) with the posterior probabilities for BI. As shown in
figure (Figure 1), the present five species were differ
phylogenetically from each other. The sequences obtained
from two species of Binema species (KM886113, KM886114)
corresponded 100% with sequences of B. ornata (JX852713), B.
korsakowi (JX852714) and formed clades with high bootstrap
support (Figure 1). The phylogenetic position of I. flagellocerca
was sister to C. ovofilamenta and M. asiatica with maximum
similarity of 75% to 73% respectively (Figure 1). The mt Cox 1
sequence of C. ovofilamenta (KM 886109) also showed the
closest similarity with I. flagellocerca (75%) and M. asiatica (81%)
(Figure 1). The DNA sequence of M. asiatica is also most closely
related to Chitwoodiella (81%) and Isobinema (73%) spp.
respectively (Figure 1). All the above species belonging to
family Travassosinematidae, formed a separate clade and
show that they are closely related to each other.

Several parasitological examinations from India have been
conducted on the basis of morphology of travassosinematids.
Majority of nematode species infecting G. africana have been
described only by the morphology except few studies [35,
36].
The descriptions available were based on the morphology of
mouth parts, oesophagus structures, tail, male and female
reproductive organs and sometimes were not sufficiently
informative. Therefore, for precise identification, support of
molecular analysis is necessitated. Attempts are now being
made to implement molecular analyses as approaches which
should provide an effective means to characterize the
nematode species [37]. The BLAST search revelaed that all five
species sequences reported in this study showed most similar
with Spauligodon, Parapharyngodon and Syphacia species (85-
75%) as all of these belong to order oxyurida. On the basis of
molecular data, all the above species of Travassosinematidae
are distinguished from each other by their mt Cox 1 sequences.
The molecular result and phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1) also
supported the identification of these five species of
travassosinematids, I. flagellocerca, C. ovofilamenta, M. asiatica, B.
ornata and B. korsakowi. All were placed within the same clade
along with high bootstrap values. Mitochondrial Cox 1
sequences have potential for DNA based identification and
diagnosis of nematode species. The genetic examination in the
presented study using Cox 1 mt gene, reveals a close
relationship with the members of other Pharyngodonidae.

Phylogenetic analysis study by Singh et al. 
[31] for Binema
species provided phylogenetic trees with the same topology as
observed during the present study. Except spp. of Binema, all
other species were sequenced first time in this study. The
precise relationship of travassosinematids is still not very clear
and it might be assessed in the future with more sequences
from other genera of this group. 

Conclusion
The data presented here will facilitate future research on these
important nematode parasites of India. For the species of
family Travassosinematidae, further work is necessitates to
fully understand the affinities of these species with detail
morphological features using SEM and should be
supplemented by molecular data from more genes. Our study
demonstrated that mt Cox 1 gene was useful for determining
the relationships among nematode species. We suggest that
further phylogenetic analysis of a range of species of
Travassonematidae will elucidate more compherensive
relationship that will provide robust taxonomic data.
