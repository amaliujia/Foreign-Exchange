sequences in the database and their analyses, efficient software is required. In this end PHYSICO2, compare to earlier PHYSICO
and other public domain tools, is most efficient in that it i] extracts physicochemical, window-dependent and homologousposition-based-substitution
(PWS) properties including positional and BLOCK-specific diversity and conservation, ii] provides
users with optional-flexibility in setting relevant input-parameters, iii] helps users to prepare BLOCK-FASTA-file by the use of
Automated Block Preparation Tool of the program, iv] performs fast, accurate and user-friendly analyses and v] redirects itemized
outputs in excel format along with detailed methodology. The program package contains documentation describing application of
methods. Overall the program acts as efficient PWS-analyzer and finds application in sequence-bioinformatics.

Background
Candidate sequences of almost every protein in the database
belong to a named family (e.g cytochrome c) with many
taxonomic groups (e.g. metazoan, cyanobacteriaum etc).
Comprehensive statistical analyses of a) physicochemical 
[1,
2,
3], b) window-dependent 
[2], c) homologous position-based
substitution properties (PWS) [4] and their comparison among
different taxonomic groups have been the recent trend in
sequence bioinformatics [1,
2]. Considering the evergrowing
sequence databases of about 6000 genomes, rapid yet accurate
PWS-analyses are sought to bring a balance between sequences
entry via genome project and their studies.

There are different web-tools that perform either
physicochemical [5,
6] or 
window-dependent [6] analysis on
per-sequence basis for one [5,
6] or few properties 
[6]. Webtools
are also there that use amino acid index values [7] for
prediction of interaction profile of sequence [8,
9] or sequences
[9] per run. However, web-tools are rare that allow mass-scale,
user-friendly analyses of PWS (3-in-1) properties in a single run
using any form of FASTA-file. Gaining insight into PWS
differential among different taxonomic groups, is of great
significance in sequence bioinformatics [1,
2,
4], would be
computationally costly by analyzing one sequence at a time and
then computing the average. Moreover management of
analytical and graphical web-data by later procedure is very
cumbersome and error-prone. Further, sharing of same websoftware
by worldwide users might cause lower processivity.
While PHYSICO [10], in contrast performs batch analyses for
PWS properties, their ranges are still less exhaustive. Now the
later to serve better, an upgraded version seems urgent such
that users i] could relish the flexibility in setting relevant inputparameters,
ii] could procure additional outputs on windowdependent
profiles for RAW-FASTA, pI-profiles and items in
similar kind of output as PHYSICO that contains novel reports
on substitution-based positional as well as BLOCK specific
diversity and conservation, iii] can access detailed
documentation on principle and methodologies used in the
program. Although capable in analyzing, PHYSICO is unable
to perform painstaking BLOCK-FASTA-file preparation that
would not only be necessary for extraction of extra information
but also for comparison of novel evolutionary properties
among different taxonomic groups of a given family.
PHYSICO2 incorporates all the above attributes along with
comprehensive up-gradation of PWS properties in reference to
earlier version and thus has been a unique tool in sequence
bioinformatics.

Methodology
The program works on input FASTA file of any form Figure 1:
(F1 &amp; F2). Upon execution it optionally allows to change default
input-parameters (DPAR) such as residue classes, pI-method
and Shannon-threshold by users one (UPAR). Program then
enters into first phase (P1) of analyses. In contrast to BLOCKFASTA
(F2), RAW-FASTA (F1) input produces only one output
(Figure 1:R1) as in this case homologous positions are noncomparable
and thus column specific analyses (that produce
additional three outputs in the former one: B2, B3 and B4) are
skipped. RAW-FASTA-file (F1) harboring sequences from one
or more taxonomic groups that are readily converted into
BLOCK-FASTA-file or files of identical width respectively
using ABPT (F3) of the program. In second phase of
computation (P2), the program performs window-dependent
property analysis. In this case if the input is BLOCK-FASTA
(where homologous positions are aligned), all sequence specific
profiles are redirected into one excel table (R5) to facilitate easy
computation of mean along with standard deviation for
taxonomically related sequences (Documentation) otherwise
each sequence specific profile is saved separately (R21, R22 etc)
in named directory (Documentation). 

Program input
PHYSICO2 is extensively tested to function in CYGWIN (32-bit)
environment. It takes either RAW (Figure 1: F1) or BLOCK −
FASTA (F2) as input. While the former is directly usable upon
downloading from the database, the later is to be prepared
(either manually or programmatically) prior to its use as input.
Unlike PHYSICO where one needs to prepare BLOCK-FASTAfile
manually, PHYSICO2 includes ABPT for its preparation
(Documentation). Users are also prompted for inputparameters
such as residue-classes, pI-method and Shannonthreshold.

Method of computation, performance of the program and experimental validation
Detailed method precedes analytical results of each item in
each output file. We performed PHYSICO2 based analyses on
representative candidate sequences from two taxonomic groups
(metazoa: 31 and cyanobacteria: 32 sequences) of “cytochrome c
family” in Intel(R) core™ i3 CPU M330 @2.13 GHz PCCYGWIN
(32 bit) environment. We also performed same
analysis using “PROTPARAM” for physicochemical (8
properties [6] and their averages) and “PROTSCALE”
(individual and average profile) for window-dependent [6]
properties using “Alliance Broadband: PRIME (54Mbps)
package” internet connection. Efficient use of these tools took ≥
10 hours for obtaining these results in excel. On the other hand,
only 6 minutes was sufficient to obtain the above and other
additional properties in PWS-format using PHYSICO2.

To compare itemized-results, same set of sequences were
subjected for analysis using available web-tools [5,
6] and
PHYSICO2. Although not all items of results could be
compared due to lack of public domain program (e.g.
substitution hetero-pair diversity) above items showed exactly
similar results (data not shown).

Program output
PHYSICO2 redirects itemized one output on physicochemical
properties for each of BLOCK (Figure 1: B1) and RAW-FASTAfiles
(R1). Unlike RAW-FASTA-file, BLOCK-FASTA-file
produces homologous position based three additional outputs
(B2, B3 and B4). Window-dependent property in case of
BLOCK-FASTA-file is in one compact output for all sequences
(Figure 1: B5) and that are in separate outputs in case of RAWFASTA-file
(Figure 1: R11, R22, etc). Detailed method also
precedes analytical results of each item of each output.

Caveats and future development
PHYSICO2 is written in AWK language that runs from C or B
shell of CYGWIN (32-bit) operating system. We are developing
GUI-based application for the program.

Conclusion
PHYSICO2, unlike other public domain programs acts as PWS
analyzer as 3-in-1 form. Unlike earlier PHYSICO, it not only
doubles PWS properties in outputs but also redirects new
output; new items in outputs along with detailed methodology
from identical input file as earlier. It provides users flexibility
for input-parameters and helps auto-preparation of BLOCKFASTA
file.
