an evitable process in human, because of subsequent loss and regain of body weight due to irregular diet. Human weight cycle
(HWC) is the major factor for causing global epidemic diseases in human beings. Understanding the HWC process would provide
potent additional knowledge to prevent obesity. However till date, there is no study dealing with examine the HWC model using
virtual cell simulation based on system biological approach. Therefore, the present study was designed to develop a computational
HWC model, which was simulated using E-cell system v3.0. The developed model has the cyclic feedback reactions of three
significant variables (the consecutive cycles of weight loss in continuous food intake (Q) and regain of body weight (P) at highest
threshold point of cognitive restraint (R)) which are obtained by mathematical modelling. The dynamic plot results supported that
the PQR variables depicted sustained oscillation with reversible modification due to protein diet. By contrast, the virtual model
simulation would provide extensive information on HWC, which might provide knowledge to develop HWC linked with obesity
pathway. The presents study concludes that optimization of body weight is essential to prevent the obesity based diseases.

Background
The Rhythms bound with the biological system, involves
network regulation as feedback loops at the cellular level. The
molecular dynamics of the organisms are controlled by
sustained oscillation in physiological functions of cellular
rhythms and the biological oscillation hold systematic
properties of regulatory interaction between metabolic/genetic
networks of cell [1]. Based on the view that post-translational
regulation in the oscillatory mechanisms of Drosophila period
protein (PER) phosphorylation is due to circadian oscillation, a
theoretical model was examined for unraveling the molecular
dynamics of the circadian rhythms [2]. More quantity of food
intake and less physical activity lead to energy imbalance and
causes obesity (over weight gain) [3].

Obesity is the major problem to human health and cause many
health risks like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases
etc. [4]. As an initial factor, dieting leads to continuous loss and
regain of body weight which is known as “yo-yo” dieting or
weight cycling (WC). The human weight cycling process is
determined through various metabolic and physiological
effects such as body weight variability, morbidity and mortality
[5]. Also, body weight fluctuations can cause substantial
changes in morbidity and mortality [6]. Once a human reached 
maximum level of overweight, reduction in food intake and
fluctuation in weight oscillatory mechanisms occurs. The
various physiological factors and their concentrations of kinetic
values of human were confirmed by weight cycling
mechanisms using experimental in vivo assessment together
with theoretical analysis. Based on the evaluations, the
mathematical model for weight cycling process was
constructed, adopting feedback of the psychological nature in
human. The model indicated the sustained oscillation levels in
body weight are reflected through the significant kinetic
parameters. The HWC process was demonstrated using
theoretical and mathematical model (Goldbeter model) with
significant PQR variables [7].

System biology is the most feasible approach in understanding
computational models and its simulations of biological rhythms
in human body systems [1]. E-Cell is an object oriented generic
software package used for cell system simulation using
substance- reactor model [8] and the same cell system is used to
analyze HWC oscillatory mechanisms in the simulation
environment. The HWC model has major physical entities such
as compartment (body) and species (body weight (P), dietary
intake (Q), cognitive restraint (R) variables).

Therefore, the present study was carried out to examine the
human weight cycling process and to elucidate the hypothesis
by adopting E-cell system. Based on the Goldbeter model and
extracted kinetic parameters datasets, we constructed a
computational HWC model for virtual simulation and the
hypothesis was examined by E-Cell. The present simulation
study would provide knowledge to further understand HWC
mechanisms in biological rhythms using other virtual
environment.

Methodology
Selection of HWC pathway:
Human weight cycling was measured using mathematical
modelling, and the physical entities of PQR constrains were
retrieved from curated models of BioModels database 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/) 
[9]. The BioModels database
provides consistent biological information with relation to
mathematical equations used to understand quantitative
models of cellular and metabolic reactions in living beings. The
HWC model (BioModels ID: BIOMD0000000079) has a
mathematical description of human body systems with
annotated biological data sets. The whole continuous stepwise
procedures were schematically represented using simulating
HWC model (Figure 1).

Parameter collection for HWC model:
The physical entities of HWC model have three major
constraints viz. P, Q, R. The PQR constraints have valuable
kinetic values represented by mathematical equations, and
these were collected from curated with annotated models
resources (BioModels database). Parameters of physical entities
and their initial concentrations values were noted as 0.43, 0.8
and 0.55 for P, Q, R respectively Table 1 (see supplementary
material). HWC model has variable with kinetic values based
on the increase and decrease concentration of PQR constraints
Table 2 (see supplementary material).

E-Cell simulation:
Script files generation for HWC model:
Although the mathematically annotated weight cycling model
was reliable in directing the set of PQR constraints, now the
kinetic and mathematical values of HWC model was generated
adopting computational script file format. In E-Cell system, the
body is known as compartment and the reaction type of system
stepper, variable and process parameters were assumed as
standard parameter in HWC model. The script file was saved
as E-Cell model file (.em) format [10] 
(http: //ecell.sourceforge.net).


Conversion of script file:
The E-Cell model script file (.em) was converted to E-Cell
markup language file (.eml) format by using tool launcher (TL)
module. Further, the .eml file was ensured like the dynamic
reaction graph of weight cycling process were in the model
editor (ME) module. The ME was used to view or edit system
stepper, variable and process value to make reliable HWC
model for simulation.

Load HWC model for simulation:
Session monitor (SM) was used for loading HWC model from
the parent directory and for visualizing the system variable
with process parameters. Model selection file was showed in
entity list window and the selected variable was viewed by
property window. PQR constraints were selected individually
using view selected option and modified variable value
provided the significant simulation.

Simulation Output:
Simulation reaction of HWC model and its PQR constraints
were exhibited in tracer window. During runtime, the tracer
window was used to trace the variables and processes of the 
model. The Y-axis and X-axis represents quantity with
molecular concentration and time respectively.

Data analysis:
The results were analyzed using Origin V.6.0 
(http://www.originlab.com) 
and Microsoft Excel. Origin is graphical
user interface (GUI) software used for the analysis of huge data
and interpretation of scientific graphs.

Discussion
During diet, the sustained oscillation was observed due to loss
and regain of repeated bout calories in body weight in human
(Figure 2). HWC process is a major factor for causing obesity,
which is developed due to chronodisruption metabolism. The
chronobiological actions of melatonin have an important role in
regulation of energy metabolism, energy balance and
optimization of body weight [11]. Obviously, chronodistuption
can cause many health risks to human and its prevention
process is showed in Figure 3. Digital information of the
genome and the environmental cues generated from the
biological information leads to understand system with
predictable core of information [12].

System-level understanding of genes and proteins information
is important to focus on comparison of system structure and
their dynamics. Dataset of quantitative and qualitative
information is required to develop a system model [13]. The
examination of cellular rhythms and their mechanisms are
more useful to collect information about biological oscillation
adopting system biological approach. Several models have been
developed based on system biology including bacterial
osmoregulation switch using E-Cell system, which deciphered
the quantitative parameters of two component regulatory
systems by virtual simulation method [8]. Based on the
extensive system biology approach, the HWC model was
developed and simulated with specific step interval and run
time. Schematic stepwise procedure used for performing the
virtual experiments are showed in Figure 1. The dynamic
reaction graph for HWC was obtained from BioModels
database and it is developed using E-Cell system 
(Figure 4A &amp; 4B).

Virtual cell simulation in variables:
Mass Action Flex Process and ODE23 stepper modules were
used to build a HWC model with efficient parameter of WC
process under virtual environment. The kinetic value of PQR
consists of molar concentration, velocity and quantity.
Synthetic oscillation was used to tune the parameters, which
control the dynamics of the regulatory network. The artificial
oscillation provides a path for pharmacological application
such as monitoring of drug delivery methods to the system 
[1].
During simulation, the identification of flux variation between
variables is more important, which is useful to clarify the
interlinked metabolic pathway and the kinetic properties of the
network. Specific step interval along with thousand seconds
runtime were used for simulating variables, and the
fluctuations were represented as a linear graph in tracer
window. The complete simulation traces were retrieved as 
output of E-cell data (.ecd) file format in logger window (LW),
which was stored as simulation results. The linear graph was
developed by stimulating the PQR variables using the
procedure showed in Figure 5A.

Effect of body weight simulation:
The body weight (P), a major variable compared to other
physical entities, was selected in tracer window. The entity list
window showed many property lists from virtually constructed
HWC model, and the variables are mass action flex process
function, quantity, molecular concentration and velocity. The
script of HWC model was loaded in E-cell system and P was
selected as 0.43 for initial concentration of simulation, whereas
in artificial numerical simulation, the standard value of P (0.43)
was multiplied by 100 and the numerical values of Q and R
were standard. Interestingly, P values showed an increased
linear static plot after stimulation (Figure 5B &amp; 5E) which was
then retrieved as an output file in tracer window. Therefore, the
results revealed that the artificial simulation alone can adopt
the changes in the body weight. The changes in body weight of
human may be the cause for secretion of appetite stimulant
hormone such as an orexigenic signal on ghrelin and other
neuropeptides, which in turn may lead to increased food intake
[14]. In addition to ghrelin a long-term regulator of energy
dissipation of plasma level in body [15], a variety of
neuropeptides were also synthesized, which regulate the food
intake.

Effect of dietary intake simulation:
The artificial numerical modification was executed for dietary
intake (Q) and the variable Q (0.8) was multiplied with 100;
whereas P and R were as the same standard. The results
showed a decreased linear plot (Figure 5B &amp; 5E). These 
changes may reflect on the secretion of gastrointestinal peptides
such as glucagon and cholecystokinin, which could probably
enhance the satiety and reduce the food intake in human 
[16].

Effect of cognitive restraint simulation:
Cognitive restraint (R) value 0.55 was multiplied with 100,
while P and Q remain in same standard values. The results
showed that R has increased level with a linear plot, which is
parallel to body weight (Figure 5C &amp; 5D). The orexigenic and
anorexigenic signals, which are involved in appetite control,
may increase when an increase in cognitive restraint occurs; so
that the body weight (P) may exceed the threshold level [7].
Therefore, the present study concluded that the E-Cell is an
efficient computational platform to design and construct virtual
model based on system biology approach.

Conclusion
The HWC process is the major reason for obesity in human,
which leads to many disease and life risks. The computational
simulation of human physiological parameter would reveal the
changes in the body virtually. Therefore, in the present study,
HWC simulation model was developed using E-cell based
system biology approach with physiological factors such as
food intake (Q) body weight (P) cognitive restraint (R). The
results concluded the steady state threshold level of body
weight dependence of R on P and Q on R. These physiological
parameters were depended on each other and their fluctuation
may cause obesity to human. The work further concluded that
the E-Cell simulation system would be used to design and
construct various virtual based system biology networks.
