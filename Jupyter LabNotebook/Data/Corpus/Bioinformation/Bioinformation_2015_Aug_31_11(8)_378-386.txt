Therefore in this view, the present study was sought to identify compounds with appreciable pharmacological profile targeting
AChE. Analogue of Rivastigmine and Fluoxetine hybrid synthesized by Toda et al, 2003 (dataset1), and Coumarin−Tacrine hybrids
synthesized by Qi Sun et al (dataset2) formed the test compounds for the present pharmacological evaluation. p-cholorophenyl
substituted Rivastigmine and Fluoxetine hybrid compound (26d) from dataset 1 and −OCH3 substitute Coumarin−Tacrine hybrids
(1h) from dataset 2 demonstrated superior pharmacological profile. 26 d showed superior pharmacological profile comparison to
the entire compounds in either dataset owing to its better electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding patterns. In order to
identify still better compound with pharmacological profile than 26 d and 1h, virtual screening was performed. The best docked
compound (PubCId: PubCid: 68874404) showed better affinity than its parent 26 d, however showed poor ADME profile and
AMES toxicity. CHEMBL2391475 (PubCid: 71699632) similar to 1h had reduced affinity in comparison to its parent compound 1h.
From, our extensive analysis involving binding affinity analysis, ADMET properties predictions and pharmacophoric mappings,
we report p-cholorophenyl substituted rivastigmine and fluoxetine hybrid (26d) to be a potential candidate for AcHE inhibition
which in addition can overcome narrow therapeutic window of present AChE inhibitors in clinical treatment of Alzheimer׳s
disease.

Background
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common
neurodegenerative disorders that constitutes about two thirds
of cases of overall dementias [1,
2,
3]. It is characterized by
progressive and irreversible degeneration of neurons in the
cortex and hippocampus [3], Alzheimer׳s disease is clinically
reported with impairment in memory, decision making,
orientation to physical surroundings and language.

Cholinergic hypothesis of the pathogenesis now shows
dysregulation of cholinergic system forms the major
pathological feature of AD [4]. Biopsies of the cerebral cortex
has shown that these cholinergic neurons which provide
extensive innervations in the cerebral cortex selectively
degenerate which affects the cognitive functions, especially
memory [5]. With the immense role of cholinergic system in
AD, several pharmacological strategies have been aimed at
correcting the cognitive deficits by manipulating cholinergic
neurotransmission. The most powerful strategy developed was
development of Acetyl Choline Esterase (ChEI) inhibitors that
selectively blocks Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE)− an enzyme
which is involved in termination of synaptic transmission by
hydrolysis of acetyl choline and finally making it unavailable
for neural transmission in coxtex which otherwise is manifested
as cognitive dysfunction observed in AD. Since the introduction
of the first cholinesterase inhibitor in 1997, most clinicians
would consider treatment by the cholinergic drugs like
donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine that forms first line
pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease [6,
7].

Various clinical trials of inhibitors have shown that, on the
whole their effects were modest however were associated with
frequent adverse reactions and lack of the drug's substrate
specificity [8]. In addition, some drugs like donepezil delays the
disease worsening but nevertheless offers acute symptoms like
headache, constipation, confusion and dizziness. In some
patients, the regular dose of donepezil, galantamine and
rivastigmine have been positively associated with acute
insomnia and anorexia [9]. Considering the side effects of the
present compounds, the treatment strategy of AD thus shifted
to ethnopharmacological approach which promises high
activity bestowed with minimal side effects. In traditional
practices of medicine, numerous plants have been used to treat
cognitive disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimer's disease (AD). There are numerous drugs
available in Western medicine that have been directly isolated
from plants, or are derived from templates of compounds from
plant sources.

Therefore, In the view of above, the present study focuses
computer based pharmacological profiling, evaluation and
identification high affinity plant compounds from the dataset of
rivastigmine and fluoxetine hybrid compound synthesized by
N. Toda et al and colleagues [10] and coumarin–tacrine hybrids
synthesized and evaluated by Qi Sun et al. [11].

Methodology
Selection of compound dataset:
The first dataset includes rivastigmine and fluoxetine hybrid
compound synthesized by N. Toda et al [10] 
Table 1 (see
supplementary material). The second dataset involved
Coumarin–Tacrine hybrids synthesized and evaluated by Qi
Sun et al. [11] 
Table 2 (see supplementary mater).

Preparation of protein and compounds:
The crystal structure of AChE receptor was retrieved from
Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB ID: 1ACJ [12] 
(Figure 2).
The X-Ray diffraction structure of AChE receptor had a
resolution of 2.80 Å and R value of 0.195. Unit cell parameters
were as Length [Å] a = 113.70, b = 113.70, c = 138.10, Angles [°]
α = 90.00, β = 90.00, γ = 120.00. The structure was downloaded
in pdb format and was further prepared for docking process.
The protein was prepared using the PrepWiz module of
Schrodinger suite. In the preparation procedure, the protein
was first preprocessed by assigning the bond orders and
hydrogens, creating zero order bonds to metals and adding
disulphide bonds. The missing side chains and loops were
filled using Prime Module of Schrodinger. Further all the water
molecules were deleted beyond 5 Å from hetero groups. Once
the protein structure was preprocessed, H bonds were assigned
which was followed by energy minimization by OPLS 2005
force field [13]. The final structure obtained was saved in.pdb
format for further studies. All the ligands were optimized
through OPLS 2005 force field algorithm embedded in the
LigPrep module of Schrödinger suite, 2013 (Schrodinger. LLC,
New York, NY) [14]. The ionizations of the ligand were
retained at the original state and were further desalted. The
structures thus optimized were saved in sdf format for docking
procedures.

Structure Similarity search:
The compound with superior pharmacological profile amongst
the two datasets was further used as query molecule in pursuit
to identify still better druglike compound than any molecules
mentioned in the dataset. Similarity search was supervised by
Binary Finger Print Based Tanimoto similarity equation to
retrieve compounds with similarity threshold of 95 % against
NCBI׳s Pubchem compound database [15].

Molecular docking of compounds:
Molecular docking program- Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD)
which incorporates highly efficient PLP (Piece wise Linear
potential) and MolDock scoring function provided a flexible
docking platform [16,
17]. All the ligands were docked at the
active site of AChE. Docking parameters were set to 0.20Å as
grid resolution, maximum iteration of 1500 and maximum
population size of 50. Energy minimization and hydrogen
bonds were optimized after the docking. Simplex evolution was
set at maximum steps of 300 with neighborhood distance factor
of 1. Binding affinity and interactions of ligands with protein
were evaluated on the basis of the internal ES (Internal
electrostatic Interaction), internal hydrogen bond interactions
and sp2-sp2 torsions. Post dock energy of the ligand-receptor
complex was minimized using Nelder Mead Simplex
Minimization (using non-grid force field and H bond
directionality) [18]. On the basis of rerank score best interacting
compound was selected from each dataset.

Bioactivity and ADMET profiling of compounds:
All the compounds were screened for its drug ability by
lipinksi filters. Biological activity of the ligands was predicted
using Molinspiration webserver (© Molinspiration
Cheminformatics 2014). The complete ADMET properties was
calculated using admetSAR [19,
20].

Pharmacophoric Mapping:
Pharmacophoric mapping which involves ligand interaction
patterns, hydrogen bond interaction, hydrophobic interactions
was evaluated using Accelrys Discovery Studio 3.5 DS
Visualizer [21].

Results &amp; Discussion
Table 1 (see supplementary material) shows the affinity
(rerank) scores of compounds of dataset1 along with the AChE
activity (IC 50) as assessed by the Toda et al. Similarly, the
affinity scores along with activity (Ki) (predicted by Sun wt al)
against AChE is shown in Table 2 (see supplementary
material). Evident from the docking (rerank) scores 26 d
(Figure 1a) from dataset 1 and compound 1h (Figure 1b) from
dataset 2 demonstrated highest binding affinity. In particular,
compound 26 d a hybrid molecule with the motifs of
Rivastigmine and Fluoxetine with functional modification with
p-chlorophenyl showed highest affinity than compounds in
either groups. From keen perusal of the structural details of
26d, it may be assumed that large substituent (R= pchlorophenyl)
may attributed to its better activity (IC50 &gt;1000)
and highest affinity (Rerank Score=-168.933).

From dataset 2, compound 1h- a Coumarin−Tacrine hybrid
demonstrated highest binding affinity against AChE. However,
our observations of binding affinity did not correlate with the
estimated activity by authors, 1q as described by authors shows
highest activity (Ki= 91.1), while adhering to our observation it
is 1h which showed highest binding affinity (rerank score=-
166.33). The discrepancies observed is an important subject for
further investigation. However, taking into consideration all
the compounds from dataset1 and 2, unarguably 26d (from
dataset) (Figure 2) demonstrated highest binding affinity and in
addition showed optimal in vitro activity.

In further approach, in pursuit to identify even better molecule
endowed with superior pharmacological profile than
compound 26 d from dataset 1 and compound 1h from dataset
2, virtual screening was performed against Pubchem database
(taking compound 61 as query). A total of 14 compounds
structurally similar to compound 26d were retrieved while 18
structural similar were retrieved against its parent compound
1h. All the similar compounds those akin to 26 d and 1h
retrieved hitherto were docked against AChE structure.
Compound with Pubchem Id: 68874404 (Figure 1c) showed
superior binding affinity out of all the similar 14 compounds
retrieved against its parent compound 26 d, while, compound
CHEMBL2391475 (PubCid: 71699632) (Figure 1d)
demonstrated superior affinity among all the 18 compounds
retrived with respect to its parent compound1h Table 3 (see
supplementary material).

It worthy to note that though PubCid: 68874404 showed
slightly higher affinity to AChE than its parent compound 26d ,
however, quite apparent from predicted activity scores, Table 4
(see supplementary material) it shows abruptly less activity
for enzyme inhibition. In addition the ADMET profiles were
comparatively poor when compared to its parent compound
26d Table 5 (see supplementary material). However, the
important drawback of compound PubCid: 68874404 was that it
was predicted to be Ames toxic. Therefore, it can be presumed
that, though it has good affinity profile, however, it should not
form candidate drug owing to its toxicity.

While in the case of CHEMBL2391475 the affinity score was
1.09 folds declined than its parent compound 1h Table 3 (see
supplementary material) in addition the predicted enzyme
inhibition activity was considerably lower Table 4 (see
supplementary material). Further ADMET profile of this
compound was quite poor; therefore even this compound
should not form an important candidate against AChE
inhibition.

In the further perusal, our pursuit was to reveal the rationale
behind superior pharmacological profile of 26 d. In terms of
binding affinity, the appreciable binding can be attributed to its
excellent interaction profile especially in terms of electrostatic
and H-bonding interactions Table 3 (see supplementary
material). Apparent from the docking profile of compound 26 d
energy values of descriptors of external ligand interactions
contributes 14.4 folds higher stability than internal ligand
interactions. Further external ligand interactions were
stabilized mostly by stearic energy guided by Piece wise linear
potentials while in internal ligand interactions, the torsional
strain contributes for the stability of the ligand receptor
interactions (and the same trend holds true for 1h of dataset 2
and similar compounds).

As show in Table 6 (see supplementary material), the
interaction profile of 26 d was quite appreciable than
compound 1h from dataset 2 and its respective similar
CHEMBL2391475 (PubCid: 71699632). An obvious thing which
can be noted is, although 26 d similar compound PubCid:
68874404 shows good interaction profile, nevertheless, as
mentioned above suffer with poor ADME properties and
AMES toxicity.

Owing to optimal affinity, high enzyme inhibition activity and
non-toxicity, 26 d was further analyzed for pharmacophoric
mappings. Comprehensively shown in Figure 3, the compound
61 demonstrates van der Waals interactions with Ile 287, Ser 81,
Tyr 331, Tyr 334, Phe 330, Phe 331, Trp 279, Phe 290, Tyr 70, Val
71, Gly 119, Trp 432, Leu 333, Ile 439, Met 436, Ser 200, Tyr 130
and electrostatic interactions with Phe 288, Arg 289, Gly 80, Trp
84, Asn 85, Tyr 121, Asp 72, Ser 122, Tyr 442, His 440, Gly 441,
Glu 199. The Compound is a hydrogen bond donor to Arg 289,
Phe 288, Phe 288. In addition π-π interactions are observed with
Phe 331.

Considering, optimal activity as experimentally predicted
AChE activity (predicted by Toda et al) and our analysis
including better binding affinity, ADMET properties
interaction profiles and pharmacophoric features, we anticipate
compound 26 d may form a potential candidate for AChE
inhibition in clinical treatment of Alzheimer׳s disease.

Conclusion
From, our extensive analysis involving binding affinity
analysis, ADMET properties predictions and pharmacophoric
mappings, we anticipate p-cholorophenyl substituted
rivastigmine and fluoxetine hybrid (26d) synthesized by Toda
et al, 2003 to be a potential candidate for AChE inhibition which
in addition can overcome narrow therapeutic window of
present AChE inhibitors in clinical treatment of Alzheimer׳s
disease.
