Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type -1 (HIV-1) belongs to the family
Retroviridae. Like all the other members of this family it requires the
enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) to reverse transcribe the genomic
RNA into DNA. The HIV-1 RT is the prime target of nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) which are used in antiretroviral
therapy (ART). In India, a combination from NRTIs and NNRTIs are
used as first line drugs to treat HIV-1 infections.

The RT enzyme has two polymerase activities, namely, RNAdependent
DNA polymerization and DNA-dependent DNA
polymerization []. The RT is a heterodimer consisting of two
subunits p66 and p51 [,]. The p66 subunit consists of 560 amino
acids whereas the p51 subunit consists of 440 amino acids. The
additional 120 amino acids in p66 are responsible for the ribonuclease
H (RNase H) activity []. The p66 subunit is responsible for the
enzymatic activity of the RT and contains the DNA binding groove
and the active site. The p66 has an ’open‘ conformation to enable it to
’grasp‘ the template. The overall shape of the p66 subunit has been
compared to that of a right hand []. It is composed of the “fingers”
(residues 1-85, 118-155), “palm” (86-117, 156-237) and “thumb”
(238-318). The “palm” subdomain is the location of the catalytic
aspartate residues (D110, D185, D186) []. In addition, it also has the
’connection‘ (319-426) and the RNase H. The p51 subunit functions
more as a scaffold for p66 and has a closed conformation. It has no
enzymatic activity [–].

The RT of HIV-1 can develop mutations that can hamper interactions
to NRTIs and NNRTIs which translates to resistance to RT inhibitors.
The mechanisms of resistance of many of these mutations have been
studied and crystal structures of these mutant RTs are available in
protein data bank (PDB). In this study, we report our studies to
elucidate structural basis of plausible mechanisms of resistance
conferred by certain mutations in clade C HIV-1 strains observed in
Indian patients. We have generated three-dimensional structural
models to postulate mechanisms of resistance induced by these
mutations.

Methodlogy
Blood samples were collected from HIV-1 infected treatment naïve
individuals and treatment experienced patients who were failing ART.
They had come to the Clinical Virology department of a tertiary care
hospital in south India for CD4+ T- cell estimation and/or HIV-1 viral
load during the years 2005-2007. The pol gene of these strains was
amplified by an in-house PCR, this sequence data was used only for
the development of the models [,]. This derived work was part of
another study wherein we looked at HIV-1 drug resistance. It
involved amplification of the HIV-1 protease and RT gene to obtain an
1800 bp amplicon.

RT sequences from 10 strains (8 from treatment failure and 2 from
treatment naive groups) (Table 1 in ) and
one reference clade C (AAY23520.1) was selected to generate three
dimensional models. The treatment naïve group was selected based on
the presence of unusual mutation/mutations not seen in clade B strains
based on results obtained from the Stanford HIV-1 drug resistance
database. The 3D modeling was done for these variants, some known
to confer drug resistance in Clade B and some are newly found in
clade C. The data on mutational patterns were based on information
got from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. The nucleotide
sequences were translated using the ExPasy translate tool
(http://www.expasy.ch/tools/dna.html). The translated sequences were
aligned using clustalw (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/).

Three dimensional models were generated by mutating the available
crystal structures of drug bound and unbound RT using the
Biopolymer tool of Sybyl (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The protein
databank codes of the crystal structures of bound and unbound forms
of RT used in this study are 1IKW [], 1VRT [], 1DLO [], 1HMV
[], 1RTJ [] and 1RTD []. Energy minimizations were carried out
by targeting the sites of mutations and neighborhood using the
Maximin tool of Sybyl package. All the atoms that were within a
distance of 6Å (Angstrom) from the mutated residue (“HOT” region),
were allowed to move during minimization. Kollman United force
field [] available in Sybyl package was used for energy
minimization. A cutoff of 9Å was used for calculating non-bonded
interactions. The inhibitor molecule was not included during energy
minimization since the sites of most of the mutations are not located
on the active site. We have used caricature modeling to postulate
changes in the RT that could affect drug affinity. Mustang [] and
DALI [,] were used for multiple and pair-wise structure
superposition respectively. PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC, San
Carlos, California) and Setor [] were used to visualize modeled
protein structures and to analyze interactions between amino acid
residues

Discussion
In this study we have studied eight mutations found in the Clade-C
strains that confer resistance to both the classes of reverse transcriptase
inhibitors viz., NRTIs and NNRTIs. Mutations that confer resistance
to these two groups of drugs are distinct. We have mainly studies
hydrogen bond interactions and van der Waals contacts involving the
site of mutation. The changes in the local interaction patterns were
then interpreted with the help of models for these mutations. The local
interaction patterns found in the drug bound RT and absent in the
unliganded protein, is expected to have some significance in
stabilizing the drug bound form here we try to identify such
interactions involving the site of mutation.

Mutations like K101H, M230L and K238T confer resistance to
NNRTIs by affecting drug entry into the binding pocket and by
altering the geometry of the pocket. Other mutations like G190A and
Y318F directly affect drug binding.

Mutations such as V75M, V118I and Q151M that confer resistance to
NRTIs act by affecting certain interactions that help dNTP (deoxy
Nucleotide Tri Phosphate) or the drug binding. This not only involves
interactions between the drug and RT but also interactions between the
drug and the template RNA.

K101H
() shows the location of Lys 101 in the wild type unliganded
RT crystal structure (1RTJ). In the ligand unbound RT structure, the
side chain of Tyr 181 points into the hydrophobic pocket where the
NNRTIs bind () This conformation is stabilized by the
hydrogen bonds formed by the side chain hydroxyl group of Tyr 181
with the side chain N-H group of Asn 136 of the p55 subunit (1DLO,
IRTD) and with side chain carboxyl of Glu 138 of the p55 subunit
(1HMV) (). The side chain of Lys 101 interacts with Pro
321 through van der Waals forces. In some structures (1DLO, 1RTD),
it also interacts with the side chain carboxyl of Glu 28 through a weak
salt bridge (). In the template/primer bound RT
structure (1RTD), Lys 101 side chain makes van der Waals contacts
with the side chain of Tyr 319 (). In the structure of RT
(1RTJ), which largely corresponds to open conformation (Figure S1
in ), Lys 101 forms a salt bridge with Glu 28.
It interacts with Glu 138 through water mediated hydrogen bonds
().

In efavirenz and nevirapine bound RT structures (1IKW, 1VRT), Lys
101 forms salt bridge with Glu 138. The side chain carboxyl of Glu
138 also interacts with Gln136 through a NH---O hydrogen bond
() Efavirenz directly interacts with the main chain
carbonyl and amino groups of Lys 101 through hydrogen bonds.
Nevirapine forms water mediated hydrogen bonds with the main chain
amino group and carboxyl groups of Lys 101 (). The
conformational changes that occur in NNRTI binding pocket upon
ligand binding are shown in . As a result of the mutation
Lys 101 → His (K101H), the salt bridge that Lys 101 forms with Glu
138 is lost (, ) due to the shorter sidechain of Histidine. This
might alter the geometry of the binding pocket. The loss of this salt
bridge might also affect the hydrogen bond interaction between Glu
138 and Gln 136 and their side chains are likely to become more
flexible. This increases the possibilities of interaction between Glu
138/Gln 136 and Tyr 181, thereby affecting the inhibitor entry into the
pocket. The direct or water mediated interactions with Efavirenz and
Nevirapine also get affected because of changes in the side chain
conformation.

M230L
The position of M230L mutation site in Efavirenz bound RT structure
is shown in  In the ligand unbound RT structures in the
closed conformation (1DLO,1HMV), Met 230 interacts with the side
chain of Pro 95 through van der Waals forces (). The side
chain carboxyl of Asp 186 and the side chain amino group of Trp 266
forms hydrogen bonds with the main chain amino and carbonyl group
of Met 230, respectively. The sulphur atom of Met 230 interacts with
the π clouds of Tyr 183 and Trp 229 (≪ 5Å distance). In ligand
unbound RT structure close to open conformation (1RTJ), Met 230
interacts with Trp 266 side chain through sulphur-π (pi) interaction
().

In RT bound to Efavirenz and Nevirapine (1IKW, 1VRT), Met 230
sulphur atom is located close to the side chain of Tyr 183 (). The side chain aromatic rings of Tyr 183 and Trp 229 interact
through π-π stacking. NH of Trp 229 can also interact with the π cloud
of Tyr 183 ().

When NNRTI enters the hydrophobic pocket, the side chains of Tyr
181 and Tyr 188 move upward, giving space for the incoming
inhibitor. This movement is accompanied by changes in side chain
conformations of Trp 229, Tyr 183 and Phe 227. The side chain
conformations of Tyr 183 and Trp 229 are stabilized by their
interactions among themselves as well as with Met 230. The
conformational changes of the residues that occur in the NNRTI
binding pocket are shown in . The mutation M230L results
in the loss of these interactions, as leucine has a smaller size compared
to methionine and can thus affect the entry of the inhibitor ().
 The interaction with Trp 266 which is in a loop joining palm and
thumb sub-domains might have a role in stabilizing the structure of RT
at different conformations. Thus, this mutation could also alter the
flexibility of RT.

G190A
Gly 190 in NNRTI bound RT structures makes van der Waals contacts
with the drugs Neviarpine and Efavirenz. When Ala replaces Gly as a
result of the mutation, the ­carbon in the Ala side chain, is at a
distance of 2.46 A and 2.58A from one of the fluorine atoms of
Efavirenz and from the cyclo propyl group of nevirapine respectively.
These are too short distances and would result in steric clash which
can seriously affect the binding of the drug.

Y318F
The site of Y318F mutation in Efavirenz bound RT (1IKW) is shown
in . The O-H group in the side chain of Tyr 318 in the
NNRTI bound complex (1IKW) interacts with the main chain carbonyl
of His 235 through O-H…O hydrogen bond. This interaction helps to
hold the side chain of Tyr 318 away from the NNRTI binding site
().

The mutation Y318F results in the loss of this interaction as Phe lacks
a hydrogen bonding group in its sidechain. This will make Phe 318
side chain more flexible, thereby affecting inhibitor binding. The side
chain hydroxyl of Tyr 318 is at a distance of 3.3Å from Efavirenz and
there are favourable van der Waals contacts between them. These
interactions are also lost as a result of this mutation ().

K238T
The interaction network involving Lys 238 shown in , might
have a role in maintaining the geometry of the NNRTI binding pocket.
The mutation K238T would disrupt this interaction network and cause
changes in the binding pocket (). RT structure in the open
conformation (1RTJ, green) superposed on Efavirenz bound RT
(1IKW, yellow) is shown in . In the NNRTI bound RT
structures, Lys 238 interacts with His 235 through van der Waals
contacts. Lys 238 side chain makes van der Waals contacts, also with
His 315. The side chain amino group forms a salt bridge with the side
chain carboxyl of Asp 237 (weak in the case of Nevirapine bound RT
(1VRT, ). The change in His 235 side chain conformation,
as a result of the mutation, could also affect Tyr 318 - His 235
interaction.

V75M
The location of Val 75 with respect to dNTP binding site is shown in
. In the RNA template/primer bound RT (1RTD), Val 75
interacts with Phe 77, Val 60 and Lys 73 through van der Waals
contacts. Phe 77 makes extensive van der Waals contacts with the
neighboring residues (). These interactions help to hold the
antiparellel beta sheet (β3- β4) and the loop involving residues 64-70
over the bound dNTP. van der Waals contacts between Phe 77 and
Pro 150 help to position Gln 151 that interacts directly with the dNTP.

The structural model for V75M mutation shows () that
terminal methyl group of Met 75 side chain is close to Phe 77. The
side chain of Phe 77 also moves to avoid steric clashes and to facilitate
formation of sulphur-π interaction between these two residues. This
affects the structural environment of the neighborhood. The hydrogen
bond interaction between Lys 73 and Tyr 146 that help to hold the β3-
β4 loop in position might be affected. The residues in the vicinity of
Val 75 and Phe 77 such as Phe 61, Asp 76 and Arg 78 ()
interact with the template strand. These interactions could also be
affected as a result of the mutation and the position of template bases
might be altered.

V118I
The position of Val 118 in template/primer bound RT structure is in a
hydrophobic environment with tight packing. In the template/primer
and TTP bound RT (1RTD), Val 118 interacts with Leu 149 and Phe
160 through van der Waals contacts (Figure S2A in ). In the V118I mutant model 
(Figure S2B in ), we note changes in the side chain conformation of Tyr 115,
Leu 149 and Ser 156 owing to the bulkier -CH2-CH3 group in the
sidechain of Ile compared to Val which has only –CH3. Tyr 115
interacts directly with the dNTP. Ser 156 forms O-H---O hydrogen
bond with the main chain carbonyl of Pro 150 and this interaction aid
in positioning Gln 151 for dNTP binding. Thus the side chain
conformational changes of these residues triggered by the presence of
bulkier Ile in the place of Val 118 would affect dNTP binding.

Q151M
In the template/primer and TTP bound RT structure (Figure S2C in ), the side chain NH of Gln 151 interacts
with the main chain carbonyl at Lys 43 through a N-H…O hydrogen
bond. The side chain carbonyl of Gln 151 also forms hydrogen bonds
with side chain N-H of Arg 72 and one of the phosphate oxygens of
dTTP. These interaction help directly or indirectly in TTP binding.
The side chain of Gln 151 also forms van der Waals contacts with TTP
and the side chain benzene rings of Tyr 115 and Phe 116.

The mutation Q151M (Figure S2D in )
would cause a loss of the hydrogen bond interactions due to apolar
nature of Met sidechain. The dramatic loss of these interactions in the
mutant could affect the closing of β3-β4 loop upon dNTP binding.
Though the side chain sulphur of Met 151 can interact with the π cloud
of Phe 116 the terminal carbon of Met 151 side chain is at a distance
of 2.27Å from one of the phosphate oxygens of dTTP. This would lead
to steric clashes and can hamper the binding of dNTP.

The mutation Q151M shows high resistance to AZT, D4T, and DDI
[]. The difference between these drugs and others like DDC, 3TC etc
is that they interact with the template base through 2 hydrogen bonds
(A-T base pairing) and not three. Also, in case of dNTPs the hydrogen
bond that the 3'OH forms is an additional interaction that can stabilize
the bound dNTP. So the mutations that affect certain interactions that
stabilize the dNTP bound to the N site can be thought to be tools for
discriminative selection.

Conclusion
The mutations were primarily seen to affect drug efficacy by a number
of ways such as altering the geometry of the drug binding pocket,
perturbing the entry of the drug into the active site, repositioning the
template bases and by discriminating the inhibitors from their natural
substrates. These are similar to the mechanisms that are known for
clade B strains [,]. The mutations that were analyzed in this study
conferred resistance to both NRTIs and NNRTIs (Figure S3 in ). Drugs belonging to these two classes have
different mechanisms of actions and hence the sites of mutations on
RT would also be expected to be distinct. NRTI resistance analyzed in
this study was mediated either by discrimination between inhibitors
and natural substrate or by template repositioning, whereas, NNRTI
resistance affected the geometry of the active site, drug binding and
entry. Sites of residue polymorphisms (not seen in Clade B strains)
found in most of our Clade C strains are shown in Figure S4 (see ). Similar to HIV-1 protease, RT is also a
dynamic enzyme but unlike in the former the mutations do not greatly
hamper the dynamics of the enzyme [,]. Resistance in RT can
broadly be seen as changes in interactions at the active site of the
enzyme which can in turn affect its behavior to the inhibitors. Newer
groups of drugs in this class would need to take into account these
mutations to be effective. RT does present itself as a potent target [].
There are two copies of RT in a HIV virion and each catalyzes about
20,000 nucleotide incorporations. Thus, there are approximately 5,000
chances for chain termination. We have studied only at a part of the
protein and this may not reflect the behavior of the entire enzyme.
However, since the study looks at changes in interactions of the amino
acids on or near the drug binding site, it is likely that our approach is
useful but within its limits.
