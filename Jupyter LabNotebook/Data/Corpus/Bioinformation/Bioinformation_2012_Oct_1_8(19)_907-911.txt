Background
Multidrug resistance (MDR) imposes a serious constraint on
successful treatment of cancer. A major factor contributing to
MDR is overexpression of efflux transporters of the ATPbinding
cassette (ABC) superfamily, which act as energydependent
drug efflux pumps [–]. Anticancer drugs within
the major categories of chemotherapeutics, including vinca
alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins and folate-based
antimetabolites [] are ABCC1 substrates and high levels of
ABCC1 expression has been associated with poor clinical
outcome in the treatment of retinoblastoma and neuroblastoma
[,
]. ABCC1 expression can also affect the response of nonsmall
cell lung cancer [], breast cancer [–], and ovarian
cancer [] to chemotherapy. ABCC1 is a 190-kDa glycoprotein
consisting of 2 nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and 3
transmembrane domains [–]. ABCC1-mediated substrate
translocation to the cell exterior is energised by ATP binding
and hydrolysis at the NBDs [,
]. Since ATP binding and
hydrolysis are fundamentally important to active drug efflux,
targeting agents to the NBDs to disrupt the catalytic cycle is a
potential strategy for addressing ABCC1-mediated cancer
multidrug resistance. In vitro studies reveal that naturally
occurring flavonoids (e.g. in fruits, vegetables, tea), bind to
recombinant ABCC1 NBDs []. Therefore, in this study,
flavonoids and flavonoid-based compounds were used as input
ligands for pharmacophore generation to identify potential
modulators of ABCC1 NBDs using both ligand
(pharmacophore)- and structure (molecular docking)-based
approaches.

Methodology
Retrieval of compounds from the NCI Database:
The library of compounds for screening against the ABCC1
transporter was obtained from the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) database in SDF format from
http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/download/nci. NCI compounds
were prepared for screening using the LigPrep process
(Schrodinger Suite 2009, Schrodinger LLC NY). The ligands
were parametised using OPLS_2005 force field and tautomers
and ionisation states expected to occur between pH 5.0 and 9.0
[,
]. Following energy minimisation, the total number of
compounds generated was 309,520. Compounds demonstrating
good drug-like properties i.e. predicted high oral bioavailability
and potentially low toxicity, were selected using the QikProp
filter based on the modification of Lipinski's rule of five [,
].
This step yielded a total of 167,350 potential drug-like
compounds.

Pharmacophore Generation and Screening:
The pharmacophore hypotheses for ABCC1 NBD1 and ABCC1
NBD2 were constructed using the basic structures of flavonoids
known to interact at each NBD (Genistein, Apigenin,
Naringenin, Galangin, Quercetin, Dehydrosilybin (DHS),
Silybin, 6-prenyl DHS, 6-geranyl DHS, 8-prenyl DHS, 8-geranyl
DHS) []. The biological activities were reported as
dissociation constants (KD), which were subsequently converted
to pKD (–log (KD)) for each NBD. Pharmacophores were
generated using PHASE (Pharmacophore Alignment and
Scoring Engine) software, version 3.1, 2009 (Schrodinger Suite
2009, Schrodinger LLC NY) [].

To identify the best-optimised hypothesis for pharmacophorebased
screening, all hypotheses for ABCC1 NBD1 and ABCC1
NBD2 were subjected to an analysis scoring function (survival
score). Compounds identified from the 167,350 drug-like
compounds were required to match at least five
pharmacophoric features to be considered appropriate for
structure-based molecular docking studies, with distance
tolerances for pharmacophoric features set at 2 Å.

Generation of the homology model of ABCC1 nucleotidebinding domain 2:
Homology modelling was used to construct the threedimensional
model of ABCC1 NBD2 using template amino acid
sequences of ABC transporters for which X-ray crystal
structures are available. An X-ray crystal structure of ABCC1
NBD1 (PDB code: 2CBZ) is available in the protein data bank
(PDB) []. The full-length human ABCC1 protein sequence (ID:
P33527) was obtained from the National Centre for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The amino acid sequence of
the C-terminal NBD of ABCC1 (Arg1292 – Asp1527) was
subsequently extracted as a target sequence. Template
sequences homologous to the ABCC1 NBD2 sequence were
retrieved using a BLAST search. An amino acid multiple
sequence alignment of ABCC1 NBD2 and the five protein
templates was generated using ClustalW []. The Espript
programme was used to generate secondary structures of the
five templates []. ABCC1 NBD2 homology models were
generated using Modeller 9 version 7 []. Stereochemical
analyses of the refined models were carried out using
Ramachandran plots by molprobity website []. Refined
models were subjected to 1000 energy minimisation steps using
GROMACS (Version 4.0) [].

Molecular Docking Screening:
Prepwizard was used to assign bond orders, add hydrogen
atoms and delete water molecules for ABCC1 NBD1 (X-ray
crystal structure) and NBD2 (homology model). Energy
minimisation was implemented using OPLS_2005 forcefield
(Schrodinger Suite 2009, Schrodinger LLC NY). Compounds
identified using pharmacophore-based screening were docked
into ABCC1 NBD1 and ABCC1 NBD2 using Glide (Grid-Based
Ligand Docking with Energetics) software package v5.5 
[]. In
this study, initially standard precision (SP) docking was carried
out and ligand conformations demonstrating the highest scores
(i.e. top 10% of docking scores) were subsequently redocked
using the extra precision (XP) docking algorithm to obtain high
quality refinement ligand poses. Visualisation of ligands was
carried out by the Maestro graphical interface.

Results and Discussion
A total of 5,953 hypotheses were constructed for ABCC1 NBD1
and 6,505 for ABCC1 NBD2. Each hypothesis possessed five
pharmacophoric features categorised as AADDD, AAADR,
AAADD, AAAAD, AAAAR AADRR, AAARR, AADDR, or
ADDRR (A, hydrogen bond acceptor; D, hydrogen bond donor;
R, aromatic ring).

For ABCC1 NBD1, the best-optimised hypothesis was
AADRR.65 (survival score: 5.952). The spatial distribution of
pharmacophore sites was two aromatic rings (R1 and R2),
whose centres were separated by 6.463 Å (). The rings
mapped to ring A and B of flavonoids (). Two H-bond
acceptors, A1 and A2 (), were separated by 4.115 Å;
A1 mapped to the oxygen atom at position 1 of flavonoids,
whereas A2 mapped to the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group
at ring C of flavonoids (). The H-bond donor D1 was
located adjacent to H-bond acceptors A1 and A2 at a distance of
3.699 Å and 5.662 Å, respectively (). D1 mapped to
the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group at position 5 of ring A
of flavonoids ().

The best-optimised pharmacophore hypothesis for ABCC1
NBD2 was AADRR.1277 (survival score: 5.955). AADRR.1277
possessed two aromatic rings, R1 and R2 separated by 6.463 Å
(), which mapped to rings A and B of flavonoids
(). The hydrogen bond donor D1, 3.257 Å from the
centre of R1, was allocated to the hydrogen atom at position 5 of
ring of flavonoids (). Two H-bond acceptors, A3 and
A4, were separated by 2.830 Å and mapped to the oxygen
atoms at positions 3' and 4' respectively of ring B of flavonoids
().

AADRR.65 (NBD1) and AADRR.1277 (NBD2) exhibited partial
structural similarity with each other, in terms of positions of the
R1 aromatic rings and R2 aromatic rings, 
(
of each pharmacophore). These pharmacophoric features
mapped precisely to rings A and B of flavonoids (
(NBD1),  (NBD2)). There was also consistency between the
position of the H-bond donor feature in each pharmacophore
( and 
) and the location of the Hbond
donor at position 5 of ring A of flavonoids. These findings
reflect the basic characteristic structural features of flavonoids
(i.e. rings A and B) reported to inhibit ABCC1 activity in vitro
[–]. Tawari et al. (2008) generated an ABCC1-targeted
pharmacophore, based on non-flavonoid-like
pyrrolopyrimidines and indopyrimidines, that was validated
using compounds with high potency against ABCC1, including
dehydrosilybin. The aromatic ring feature () of
AADRR.65 and AADRR.1277 was also present in the
pharmacophore generated by Tawari et al. (2008), as was the
hydrogen bond acceptor feature (A2) in ABCC1 NBD1 
() 
[]. Pharmacophore-based screening of the NCI database
with AADRR.65 and AADR.1277 identified 3,163 and 1,113 hit
compounds respectively.

Generation of the homology model of ABCC1 nucleotidebinding domain 2:
Sequences homologous to ABCC1 NBD2 were retrieved using a
BLAST search filtered for known 3D structures. The Escherichia
coli haemolysin B NBD (PDB code: 1MT0) [] demonstrated
highest sequence identity, 37%, with ABCC1 NBD2 whilst
Salmonella typhimurium MsbA (PDB code: 3B60) 
[] and
Plasmodium yoelii MDR protein 2 (PDB code: 2GHI) 
[] both
demonstrated 36% sequence identity. The bacterial ABC
transporter Sav1866 (PDB code: 2HYD) [] and the Lactococcus
lactis ABC transporter NBD (PDB code: 1MV5) 
[] possessed
35% and 34% amino acid identity respectively. Multiple
sequence alignment of human ABCC1 NBD2 with the structural
template sequences demonstrated the highly conserved regions
within the proteins, namely the Walker-A and –B motifs,
Signature sequence, Q-loop, D-loop and H-loop ().

The ABCC1 NBD2 homology model is comprised of Arm I and
Arm II which together possesed ten β-sheets and ten α-helices
() consistent with the secondary structures of the
template sequences. Arm I, the ABC-β subdomain, is composed
of nine β-sheets and two α-helices containing the conserved P
loop, Walker B, H-loop and D-loop sequences. The P-loop
sequence is located within a linker region between β3 and α1
and the Walker B sequence is localised in β7. Arm II represents
the ABC-α subdomain and contains eight α helices (α3-α10)
with the Signature sequence (C-motif) located at α6 of the ABC-
α subdomain. The homology model with the highest percentage
of amino acids within the favoured regions, 97.9%, and allowed
regions, 99.6%, as identified by Ramachandran plot analysis,
was used in subsequent docking studies. Within the homology
model only a single amino acid, Asp1389, was not within the
allowed region.

Molecular Docking Screening:
The ligand conformation possessing the lowest docking score is
representative of a conformation with favourable binding
energy (i.e. high binding affinity). The docking scores of
compounds docked into ABCC1 NBD1 (using XP docking
mode) ranged from -7.33 to 0.77. Approximately 5% (13/265) of
these compounds possessed a lower docking score than ATP (-
6.19), suggesting they may bind with a higher affinity compared
to ATP. Docking studies of these compounds, NSC93033,
NSC662377, NSC319661, NSC333748, NSC683893, NSC226639,
NSC94231, NSC55979, NSC169121, NSC166574, NSC73380,
NSC127738 and NSC115534, within ABCC1 NBD1 revealed a
propensity for them to be partially accommodated in the ATP
binding site within the binding cavity. The oxygen and
hydrogen atoms of the above compounds were predicted to
form extensive hydrogen bonds with Gly681, Lys684, Ser685
and Ser686 within the P-loop. Hydrophobic interactions were
also identified between the compounds and the aromatic amino
acid Trp653 ().

The predicted docking score of NCI compounds docked into
the homology model of ABCC1 NBD2 ranged from -7.36 to -
1.60. Approximately 7% (7/104) of these compounds were
predicted to possess a lower docking score than ATP (ATP
docking score; -6.17), and may bind with relatively high affinity
to the NBD. These compounds were NSC91789, NSC529483,
NSC211168, NSC318214, NSC116519, NSC372332 and
NSC526974. The predicted docking orientation of the highaffinity
compounds within ABCC1 NBD2 overlapped with that
of ATP and the oxygen atoms and hydrogen atoms were
predicted to form a network of hydrogen bonds with Lys1333,
Ser1334 and Ser1335 within the P-loop. Hydrophobic contacts
stabilised the interaction with the aromatic amino acid Tyr1302
().

The predicted ATP-binding site is a narrow pocket which
restricts the binding orientation of selected NCI compounds, i.e.
restricted along a site defined by aromatic residues (Trp653 in
NBD1) and Tyr1302 in NBD2) and the P-loop cavity. Our
studies have shown that Trp653 (NBD1) and Tyr1302 (NBD2)
are significant for ligand-binding since, in both NBDs, they
interact with hydrophobic moieties of compounds with
predicted high-binding affinity. Importantly, NCI compounds
with predicted low binding affinities (high docking scores)
demonstrated fewer or no hydrophobic interactions with these
key aromatic amino acids (data not shown). These findings are
consistent with the important stabilising hydrophobic
interactions reported between the adenine ring of ATP and
Trp653 (NBD1) and Tyr1302 (NBD2) in ABCC1 []. The P-loop
in both NBDs was predicted to be the main site for hydrogen
bond interactions between docked NCI compounds and ABCC1
NBDs. This is expected since the P-loop region contains a large
proportion of polar amino acids and is the well-recognised site
of hydrogen bond interaction between the phosphate groups of
the endogenous ligand ATP and NBDs [,
,
]. In addition,
this finding is supported by the study of Badhan (2006) in
which the in silico interaction of flavonoids with ABCB1 (Pglycoprotein)
NBD2 reports the 3-hydroxyl and 5-hydroxyl
groups and carbonyl oxygen are involved in hydrogen bonding
with the P-loop [].

Currently, flavonoid-based compounds are the only group of
chemical structures reported to modulate ABC transporters by
binding to NBDs [, 
–]. Our studies show all screened NCI
compounds possessed the pharmacophoric features of
flavonoid-based compounds as the primary chemical scaffold.
Although some hits differed structurally from flavonoid-based
compounds, they possessed the same pharmacophoric features
and predicted molecular interactions within ATP-binding sites,
namely hydrogen bonding at the P-loop and hydrophobic
interactions at aromatic acid residues (Trp653 in NBD1, and
Tyr1302 in NBD2).

Conclusion
We have identified compounds from the NCI repository
predicted to bind with high affinity at the ATP-binding sites
within the ABCC1 efflux transporter. These compounds may
show potential as modulators of the catalytic cycle of ABCC1
and consequently could inhibit ABCC1 transporter-mediated
drug efflux.
