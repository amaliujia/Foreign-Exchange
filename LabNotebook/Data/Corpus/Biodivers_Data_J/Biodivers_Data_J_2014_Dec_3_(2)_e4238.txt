Introduction
The subgenus Idiopyga () consists of 26 Holarctic (sub)species, of which 25 occur in the Palaearctic region (). Most of the species have wide ranges, such as D. (I.) magnicauda Lundström, D. (I.) murina (Zetterstedt) and D. (I.) ponojensis Lundström. A few species, or taxa that are recognised as subspecies, may have very restricted ranges (e.g. D. (I.) melleicauda
stenoptera Savchenko [], D. (I.) lulensis (Tjeder) []) or disjunct ones (e.g. D. (I.) esbeni (Nielsen) [, ]). Dicranomyia (Idiopyga) species are characterised by a complicated structure of male hypopygium, having appendages on their ventral gonostylus and gonocoxite. The female cerci are very short in species such as D. (I.) intricata Alexander and D. (I.) lulensis whereas a normal length (i.e. of normal length compared to other Dicranomyia species) in e.g. D. (I.) halterella Edwards and D. (I.) ponojensis. Species of the subgenus occur around temperate and subarctic wetlands (e.g. , , , ), and some species favour or tolerate elevated concentration of salt (brackish water or salt marshes, , ).

Dicranomyia (I.) intricata was reported from Finland by Nieminen () in his M.Sc. thesis and the status of this species on the Finnish list of crane flies was later complemented and verified by Salmela (). However, during a project aiming to DNA barcode of (?) all Finnish crane fly species (http://www.finbol.org/eng/ENG_finbol.html), an abnormal intraspecific divergence was noted among the sequenced D. (I.) intricata specimens. Followed up by morphological examinations of voucher specimens, it was obvious that instead of one species there were two, distinguishable on both molecular and morphological basis (). Examination of available type material (D. (I.) intricata, D.
suecica (Nielsen)) allowed us to associate our morphospecies to taxonomic species. In the current article we describe a new Dicranomyia species from Finland and redescribe male and female post-abdomen of D. (I.) intricata. The new species is hitherto known from the northern Baltic area whereas D. (I.) intricata has a Holarctic range. To summarize, the approach we use is integrative (see e.g. ). The description is based on integrative approach combining morphology, digital photographs, DNA barcodes and phylogenetic analysis.

Materials and methods
The morphological terminology used here mainly follows . Terminology of some special parts of male genitalia was taken from  and female genitalia from , . The following acronyms for museums and collections are used: USNM – Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, USA; ZMUC – Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; ZMUT – Zoological Museum, University of Turku, Turku, Finland; JES – Private collection of Jukka Salmela, Rovaniemi, Finland; JSO – Private collection of Jaroslav Starý, Olomouc, Czech Republic. All material deposited in ZMUT and JES are in 70% ethanol, other studied material was dry and pinned. Description is based on specimens preserved in ethanol; male and female hypopygia were macerated in KOH and are preserved in glycerol. Measurements of palpomeres, antennal segments and legs are based on a single specimen.

Layer photos were taken using an Olympus E520 digital camera, attached to an Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope. Digital photos were captured using the programmes Deep Focus 3.1 and Quick PHOTO CAMERA 2.3. Layer photos were finally combined with the program Combine ZP.

A 658 bp fragment of mitochondrial protein-encoding cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) was sequenced from a total of 22 Dicranomyia specimens and one Metalimnobia specimen. Legs or 2–3 abdominal segments of the specimens were placed in 96% ethanol in a 96-well lysis microplate and dispatched to the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding, Biodiversity Institute of Ontario where DNA was extracted and sequenced using standard protocols and primers (). The fragment was successfully amplified for all taxa except for D. (I.) esbeni for which the last 51 basepairs were missing due to sequencing problems. The new sequences are deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KP064165-KP064187 (Table ) and are also available in Suppl. material .

Phylogenetic analyses

Parsimony approach


Since the number of studied taxa was only 23, no heuristic methods were needed for the parsimony analysis. This allowed us to explore all possible evolutionary hypotheses for our data via explicit enumeration (branch and bound) analysis in TNT (Tree Analysis using New Technology) version 1.1 (). Nodal support was measured by jackknife resampling () using 1000 replicates.


Maximum likelihood approach


Maximum likelihood analysis was conducted with RAxML ver. 8.0.22 () in the CIPRES Science Gateway (). A unique general time-reversible (GTR) model of sequence evolution was specified and 100 independent searches were conducted. Nodal support was estimated via the rapid bootstrap algorithm (applying the Majority Rule Criterion) using the GTR-CAT model ().

Diagnosis
Brownish, small species, very close to D. (I.) intricata. Ventrobasal lobe of ventral gonostylus sinuous, apex oval. Inner appendage of gonocoxite apically rounded. Rostral prolongantion of ventral apically rather narrow and subrostral prolongation simple, not bilobed, bearing dark stout spines. Female infra-anal plate with strong caudal peak.

Etymology
Boreo (borealis, Latin)= north, baltica (Latin)= referring to the Baltic Sea. The species is so far known from the northern Baltic area. The species name is deemed to be a latinized adjective in nominative singular.

Distribution
European, only known from Finland. The species is hitherto known from five separate localities; four of these are shore meadows in Oulunsalo and Hailuoto island (see ), and the fifth locality is in Tornio, a rich fen ca. 12 km inland from the coast line, 15 m above sea level (Fig. ).

Ecology
The species is probably halophilous, occurring in Baltic coastal meadows characterised by vascular plants such as Phragmites
australis, Lysimachia
thyrsiflora, Eleocharis
palustris, Carex
halophila and C.
paleacea (, as D. (I.) intricata). These coastal meadows are produced by a phenomenon called land uplift, that is, the rebound of earth's crust after the retreating of the ice sheet; in the Bothnian Bay the rate of land uplift is about 8 mm/year (). In addition to the meadows influenced by brackish water, the species has been collected from a calcareous rich spring fen. This rich spring fen is known to have high concentrations of e.g. Ca (53 mg/l), Na (5.3 mg/l), Fe (32 mg/l) and having high specific conductivity (42.7 mS/m), alkalinity (4.85 mmol/l) and pH (7.9, T. Sallantaus, personal communication). This spring fen is located quite close to the current shore line, and extrapolating from  (fig. 21), one may estimate that this fen was on the Baltic shore some 600-700 years ago. It may be that high concentrations of dissolved minerals in the fen resemble brackish water habitat, allowing the survival of this halophilous crane fly species. It may thus be assumed that D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. is a recent relict species in the fen. It should be noted that some plants typical for the Baltic shores or brackish water have isolated populations on calcareous ponds or mires far from coastal areas (e.g. Tricloghin
maritima, Potamogeton
filiformis, )

Conservation
Due to its apparent rarity, that is, small area of occupancy and extent of occurrence, the species could most likely be assessed as a threatened species according to IUCN criteria. Habitats of this species are highly endangered, usually small and isolated. There are a total of ca. 4200 ha of Baltic coastal meadows along the Finnish coast, and all such habitat types are red-listed (). Also spring fens are threatened habitats (). Furthermore, Salmela () studied adult crane fly fauna of 20 springs, of which 10 were calcareous springs, only some 30–60 km northeast from Kusiaskorpi rich fen, and D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. was absent from the samples. This and other negative records (i.e. absence) from &gt;500 Malaise trapping sites in Finnish wetlands (, , J. Salmela unpublished) indicate a very restricted range of this species. In a matter of fact, there are some endemic or highly disjunct plant (e.g. Alisma
wahlenbergii, Euphrasia
bottnica, Primula
nutans) and insect (Elachista
vonschantzi, Holopyga
metallica, Macroplea
pubipennis) species in the Baltic coastal areas (, , , , ). Hence, by using the above mentioned plants and insects as surrogates, D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. could either be i) a recently evolved allopatric species that survived Pleistocene glaciations and is currently only present in the Baltic area or ii) a disjunct species having populations in other (coastal) areas.

Taxon discussion
Based on morphology and COI sequence divergence, the new species is very closely related to the Holarctic species D. (I.) intricata. As already stated in the title of this article, the new species is cryptic, meaning that it is hard to distinguish from its sister species by morphological characters. Strictly speaking, cryptic species may mean taxa that are morphologically indisguishable (, but see ), but the new species described here can be separated from its sister species by using a genetic marker (barcoding region of COI) and morphology. However, morphological differences between these two species are not great and the only reliable diagnostic characters are found from male and female genitalia. These two species are allopatric, their closest known populations lay some 180 km apart. Despite these species not being from sympatric populations, we assume that their differences are well sufficient to keep their gene pools separated even in the case of possible secondary contact. Their COI divergence or K2P distance (5 %) is far too high to be considered as an intraspecific variation among majority of other insects (e.g. , ) or crane flies (). Instead, intraspecific variation among insects is typically smaller than 2 % and higher COI divergence usually indicates two separate species (, ). Considering morphology, there is a recent case study from Israel () showing that two closely related, allopatric Phyllolabis crane flies were treated as separate species although they have almost identical genitalia and the closest populations of these species live only 30 km apart. In Israel, the species were separated by a dispersal barrier (Rift Valley, ); in Fennoscandia, D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. and D. (I.) intricata are not separated by a distinct barrier, they have non-overlapping ranges perhaps because of biogeographic factors driven by climate (see e.g. , ) and availability of habitat (brackish water, calcareous springs in the vicinity of coast line).

External characters, such as wing venation and body coloration, between D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. and D. (I.) intricata are practically identical. The most important differences in male and female post-abdomen between the species are summarized in Table . Among other D. (Idiopyga) species, the new species is quite close to D. (I.) esbeni. Besides other details, the ventrobasal lobe of gonocoxite in D. (I.) esbeni is sinuous (see , fig. 1), and rather straight in D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. Dicranomyia (I.) melleicauda complicata de Meijere is also quite close to the new species, but has rather stout iagx and apically wide lvg (see , plates 5-6). Males of other species are easily separated from the new species based on differences in the stucture of hypopygium. Considering females, we refrain from further discussion due to the lack of comparative material.

Based on K2P () distances, the new species is closest to D. (I.) intricata (K2P distance 5.13 %), D. (I.) esbeni (7.16 %) and D. (I.) magnicauda (9.51 %); other distances within examined D. (Idiopyga) species range between 10.76 and 15.70 %.

Dicranomyia (Idiopyga) intricata
: 224 (distribution, ecology)

The holotype specimen of D. (I.) intricata (Fig. ) is in good condition, dry and pinned, hypopygium is not detached. Alexander (, fig. 1) permanently slide-mounted and illustrated his paratype specimen (Fig. ). The holotype of Dicranomyia
suecica Nielsen was re-described and well illustrated by Tjeder () and the species was proposed as a synonym of D. (I.) intricata by . Unfortunately the male hypopogiym of D.
suecica is lost (T. Pape, personal communication), but based on Tjeder's detailed illustrations this nomenclature can be verified. Alexander's original description is good, and there is no need to thoroughly re-describe this species. However, male and female genitalia are illustrated here and diagnostic characters are discussed under D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n.

Male hypopygium. 9th tergite and proctiger as in Fig. . Gonocoxite dark brown, sparsely covered with dark setae. Ventromesal lobe of gonocoxite as in Fig. . The main lobe (lgx) club-like, straight and elongated, apex beak-like, having medially patch of hyaline curly setae (Fig. ). The appendage of ventromesal lobe (algx) as in Fig. . Inner appendage of gonocoxite (iagx, Fig. , , ) sclerotized, curved, apically with a number of stout, short setae; apex of iagx bilobed. Structure of gonostylus as in D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n., see Fig. , , . Ventrobasal lobe of ventral gonostyle (lvg) tail-like, slightly sinuous, weakly sclerotized, having patches of hyaline setae both basally and apically; its stalk narrowing toward apex; apex of lvg spherical (Fig. ). Rostrum (rm) light brown, apically widest, bearing two strong spines (Fig. ). Subrostral prolongation of ventral gonostyle (srm) strongly sclerotized, bilobed, very robust, approximately as long as rm, almost parallel with rm; srm with number of median and subapical stout black spines, apical spines are hyaline/light brown (Fig. , , ). Ventral surface of aedeagus bearing hyaline setosity, lateral margins of parameres rather strongly serrated (Fig. ). See also Suppl. material .

Female postabdomen. Cerci and hypogynial valves, see Fig. .

Distribution
Holarctic. Known from Canada (Alberta, Northwest territories, British Columbia), Sweden (North Sweden, Abisko, , ) and Finland. In Finland D. (I.) intricata is known from the north boreal ecoregion, both from the zone of coniferous forests and from the subarctic fell area in the northernmost part of the country (Fig. 

Ecology
The original description of D. (I.) intricata () was based on material collected from "Muskeg" bogs. Muskegs are nutrient poor peatlands dominated by Sphagnum mosses (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskeg). Most of the Finnish sampling sites are aapamires, that is, minerotrophic fens with wet, usually moss covered, flarks (hollows) and drier hummock-level strings. Most of the sites are intermediate rich or rich fens, characterised by brown mosses (e.g. Warnstorffia, Scorpidium, Paludella). The species was especially abundant on two closely lying intermediate rich, Sphagnum dominated aapamires in Enontekiö, NW Finnish Lapland, but single specimens were also caught along a spring and a headwater stream (). The species is on the wing from mid August to early September.

Conservation
Dicranomyia (I.) intricata is red-listed in Finland (NT, ). At the time of the assessment, it was not known that D. (I.) intricata is absent from the northern Baltic coastal area and is replaced there by a sibling species (D. (I.) boreobaltica sp.n. Salmela). Thus the range ("extent of occurrence") of D. (I.) intricata is actually smaller that was thought in the 2010 assessment. However, the species is not extremely rare and there are most likely hundreds of square kilometres of suitable breeding sites for the species in Finnish Lapland. Nevertheless, the species may be jeopardized by climate change and it may also be used as an indicator of pristine boreal mires.

Analysis
The phylogenetic tree (length 622 steps) resulting from the parsimony analysis is shown in Fig.  and the optimal maximum likelihood tree (lnL = -3501.956818) in Fig. . The results are not methodology-dependent since both parsimony and likelihood approaches resolve D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. as sister to D. (I.) intricata and these two species grouping together with D. (I.) esbeni. Nodal supports in both results are good giving strong indications that D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. forms its own group being in a sister group relationship with D. (I.) intricata. There are altogether 31 bases in COI that differ between D. (I.) boreobaltica Salmela sp.n. and D. (I.) intricata, resulting in 4.7 % difference between these species. Although nodal supports in the deeper, evolutionary older nodes are low, separate species are clearly distinct.
