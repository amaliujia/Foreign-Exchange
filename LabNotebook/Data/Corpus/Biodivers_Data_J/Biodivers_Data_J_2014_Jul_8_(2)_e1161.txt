Introduction
Macroevolutionary transitions between marine and non-marine habitats are uncommon and rarely lead to long-term success in the invaded habitat (). This is largely due to terrestrial niches being occupied by groups with a longer evolutionary history in these habitats as well as the marine invaders' lack of traits withwhich to successfully confront the differences in terrestrial selection regimes ().

However, while their larvae still develop in marine habitats, adults of the crab family Gecarcinidae have successfully conquered island habitats, where they play an important ecological role ( for a review). Species of the Gecarcinus-group (including Johngarthia, Gecarcinus and Gecarcoidea () are dominant through sheer numbers, on some islands their mass exceeds the total mass of animals reported in tropical rain forests in Costa Rica and the central Amazon () and they may occupy the top of the energy pyramid ().

Nevertheless, despite their success on islands and possible dispersal in their larval stage via sea currents, most species of the Gecarcinus-group are absent from continental mainland habitats (; see ). One reason for this may be the predictable mass migrations to the coast for larval release (e.g. , , ), which may render species of this group especially vulnerable to terrestrial predators, therefore limiting dispersion and the chances of success on the continental mainland. The negative impact on populations exerted by e.g. terrestrial vertebrates is supported by observed population declines or extinctions after island settlements by humans, which often actively hunt land crabs, or after the anthropogenic introduction of crab predators/competitors such as rats, feral cats and pigs ().

Johngarthia
planata (Stimpson, 1860) appears to be a textbook example for the group's failure to establish itself on the continental mainland despite the advantages of ecological flexibility and favorable larval dispersion patterns (reviewed by ). Johngarthia
planata occurs on the Baja California Peninsula and several oceanic islands in the Eastern Pacific as well as on inshore islands of the Mexican, Costa Rican and Colombian coasts. This wide presence is likely the result of amplified dispersal via coastal currents (). However, likely due to the large diversity of terrestrial predators/competitors, Johngarthia
planata has not been observed on continental mainland locations until now ().

In this study I report the first continental mainland records for Johngarthia
planata and discuss the possibility that human presence might actually facilitate the mainland settlement of such a species.

Materials and methods
The present study encompasses the Pacific coast from Mexico to Colombia. Following  and  the Baja California peninsula is treated separately to the rest of Mexico, which is referred to throughout the text as “Mexican mainland” or “continental mainland” respectively. To investigate the mainland presence/absence patterns of Johngarthia
planata I performed an Internet search via Google.com (search function “images”) and flickr.com. Flickr is an image hosting web site that is reported to host more than 6 billion photographs. Users uploading their photos to Flickr are able to add key words (“tags”) that facilitate a search on Flickr and also in web search services such as Google and Yahoo.  I searched with various combinations of the key words “crab” or “cangrejo” (Spanish for crab) and “Pacific, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia”; and all regions of the respective countries with access to the Pacific coast. I then considered for evaluation only individuals on photographs from locations that were confirmed by the photographers and demonstrated clearly visible characteristics of Johngarthia
planata (see ).

Analysis
The Internet search revealed photographs of 12 individuals from Mexico (mainland) and three individuals from Panama (Iguana Island) (Table , Figs , ). The diagnostic characters used (both apical lobes of the third maxilliped merus subequal, the leg spines prominently developed, the carapace depressed and the dark red color with orange chelipeds and cream cutting edges) (Fig. ) were consistent with other examined specimens found on islands in Mexico and Costa Rica () as well as on Gorgona Island, Colombia (see ). The specimens found on the Mexican mainland are the first continental mainland specimens ever recorded, and the specimens on Iguana Island are the first recorded in Panama. The species has been previously reported by  and  for “Panama” in error, likely following the reference “Malpelo Island, off Bay of Panama” by . Malpelo Island is inhabited by Johngarthia
malpilensis, but the island is part of Colombia.

All mainland records of Johngarthia
planata cited here refer to tourist beaches close to villages or small cities. Several photographs show individuals of Johngarthia
planata foraging diurnally, running along house walls or even inside of houses and mating (Fig. ).

The Internet search did not reveal any photographs of Johngarthia
planata from Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. For the latter country, the only known records to date are those cited by .

Discussion
 attribute the absence of land crab species on the continental mainland to the presence of predators. However, this pattern is less pronounced in the Neotropics where Cardisoma
crassum, Cardisoma
guanhumi, Gecarcinus
lateralis and Gecarcinus
quadratus share evolutionary traits which allow it to adapt to the conditions in a coastal band of the continental mainland (e.g. , , ). On the other hand, the remaining four species of Johngarthia (see , , ) and Gecarcinus
ruricola () have been reported from islands only, supporting the pattern suggested by . Several studies strongly indicate that Johngarthia
planata has not established populations along the Central American mainland coast (see  for a short review; Fig. ), which agrees with the pattern of mainland absence observed in the four congeners. The ecological flexibility of Johngarthia
planata, which occurs in habitats ranging from island rainforests to rocky terrain with sparse vegetation (, ), suggest that the most significant factors which preclude such species from inhabiting the mainland are indeed competition or/and predation (). The presence/absence pattern of Johngarthia
planata in continental mainland habitats roughly coincides with the replacement of the moist forests of Panama and Costa Rica by dry forests that extend from Nicaragua to Mexico (see ). The diversity of possible crab predators such as birds () and mammals () is lower in the Southern Pacific Dry forest ecoregion than in tropical rainforests of Central America. Whether Johngarthia
planata appears as well in non-urban areas along the Mexican Pacific coast remains unclear, however, the mainland establishment of such species might be facilitated close to or in urban areas where the lower diversity or/and abundance of possible predators/competitors is influenced by the presence of humans. Studies from undisturbed forest in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica (, , pers. observ.) relate cryptic behavior of gecarcinid land crabs to less suitable abiotic conditions and predator presence. On Caño and Nairita (), Maria Cleofa (), Socorro () and Gorgona () islands, Johngarthia
planata is active at night, which is most likely due to the presence of bird predators. In contrast, observations from Sayulita (), a newly reported mainland record for Johngarthia
planata (Table ; Fig. ), suggest that the land crab activity there is less influenced by predator impact:

“Visitors who arrive in Sayulita during the rainy season (June-October) and decide to take a leisurely walk through the jungle towards the beach are usually quite surprised, even shocked, to find the jungle floor literally teeming with thousands of purple-and-yellow and red land crabs. Crabs seem to be foraging everywhere in the leaf litter, wildly waving their claws and scurrying away to their burrows and caves at the first apprehension of danger. Most people find them interesting and amusing, even comical, with their tubular, hyper-vigilant eyes, their defensive postures and wild gestures.”

Further photographs and accounts by  and Brewer (in litt.) indicate that Johngarthia
planata is a common element of the urban wildlife and seeks food and shelter in closest proximity to human houses:

“People who have built homes in the jungle near the ocean, however, consider the all-pervasive land crabs quite troublesome. If the crabs can get into the house (they can climb walls!), they can damage clothing, books, and food. Outside of the house, they are quite hard on garden plants, shredding foliage and damaging plant roots from inside their tunnels. By the time November comes, most folks are happy to see the crabs retreat into the ground!” ()

These observations demonstrate that human presence does not necessarily have a negative impact on land crabs, as suggested by . The relationship between land crabs and humans might depend on the type of habitat, human settlement system and land use. Exploitation by hunter-gatherers on islands and the introduction of domesticated animals are assumed to have resulted in the extinction of local populations of Gecarcinus
ruricola () and a species of Geograpsus (). However, the consumption of land crabs has not been reported from tourist destinations along the Neotropical Pacific coast. As free-roaming domestic animals may be seen as a detriment to tourism (), populations of possible land crab predators/competitors such as pigs, cats, dogs and rats (see ) tend to be more controlled than in areas with farmers or hunter-gatherers.

Because gecarcinid land crabs significantly influence tree recruitment by consuming seeds, propagules and seedlings, they are considered important ecosystem engineers (reviewed by ). While human presence might open a new evolutionary pathway for these otherwise island restricted land crabs, the colonization of continental mainland forests by a large species such as Johngarthia
planata (see  for a size comparison) would certainly have profound consequences for the structure and species composition of coastal ecosystems, particularly in view of the possibility that their foraging activity would be less restricted due to lower predation pressure. Further surveys for Johngarthia
planata and possible crab predators/competitors are needed to determine if the known distributional pattern of such species is the result of human influence.
