Introduction
The genus Metopheltes was described as a monotypic genus by Toichi Uchida in 1932, with Metopheltes
petiolaris Uchida, 1932 from Japan as the type species (). It was placed in the tribe Perilissini of the subfamily Ctenopelmatinae (Hymenoptera, Ichneumonidae) and is considered to be closely related to the genus Opheltes Holmgren, 1859. But twenty years before another species of this genus, Metopheltes
chinensis (Morley, 1913) was discovered from China and placed within the genus Opheltes (). It was transferred to the genus Metopheltes by Henry Townes ().

The members of the genus are rather rare as well as Ctenopelmatinae in general in the Oriental region. This species-rich subfamily includes mostly koinobiont endoparasitoids of sawfly larvae (Hymenoptera: Symphyta) and is more diverse in temperate than tropical zones as the primary host groups are relatively scarce in tropical habitats (, ). We know 60 species of Ctenopelmatinae recorded from the Oriental region, mostly China, while in contrast 757 species are known from the Western Palaearctic (). On the other hand sawfly diversity in South East Asia is expected to be rather high () and the history of Ctenopelmatinae research in this region is rather recent when compared with Europe.

Nothing is known about the biology of Metopheltes. However species of the closely related (see Diagnosis) genus Opheltes were reared from large-bodied sawflies of the genera Cimbex Olivier, 1790 and Agenocimbex Rohwer, 1910 (Hymenoptera, Cimbicidae) (, , , , , , , , ). Hosts of Metopheltes members could be expected within cimbicid sawflies associated with deciduous trees. Here we provide a detailed up-to-date diagnosis of the genus and a description of a new species (Metopheltes
clypeoarmatus
sp. n. from Vietnam) is added. Metopheltes
petiolaris Uchida, 1932 is recorded for the first time from Russian Far East.

Materials and methods
The specimen of Metopheltes
clypeoarmatus
sp. n. was collected with a Malaise trap in the Cuc Phuong National Park (Vietnam) in 2000 (Fig. ). The biotope was a small piece of disturbed lowland rainforest on limestone just inside the park and about 1 km from the headquarter buildings. The holotype of the new species is deposited in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden (RMNH). We also studied specimens of Metopheltes
petiolaris Uchida, 1932 from the Zoological Museum of Moscow State University (ZMUM) and the Smithsonian Institution (USNM) and Opheltes
glaucopterus (Linnaeus 1758) from the Swedish Museum of Natural History (NHRS). The only known specimen of Metopheltes
chinensis which is actually the type was not available for examination due to a loan policy of the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH) and we had to use photos. The morphological terminology follows Gauld (). Photographs of the specimens, excluding Metopheltes
chinensis, were taken with a Canon EOS 7D digital camera and combined using Zerene®.

Diagnosis
Metopheltes shares several character states with Opheltes: the presence of a thyridium on the second tergite of the metasoma (Fig. ), the absence of a distinct tyloid on the basal flagellomere and a deep groove extending the full length of the mesopleuron (Fig. ) (). This mesopleural character is not unique within Perilissini and occurs also in Priopoda
impressa Reshchikov, 2012 () and some Westwoodiini (). Unlike Opheltes (Fig. ) the second maxillary palpomere is not modified in Metopheltes (Fig. ) while the frontal carina (a character state previously found only in Opheltes) is present in Metopheltes
clypeoarmatus
sp. n. (Fig. ), though less developed. Metopheltes also differs from Opheltes by the shape of the propodeum in lateral view: the basal part rounded (elevated at an acute angle in Opheltes); its apical part comparatively elongate and the apical transverse carina not elevated (Figs , ). The median apical ligulate process of the last visible sternite of male is notched apically and laterally (Fig. ). The tip of the aedeagus is bent over and ends in an adze-like blade.

Notes
This species is represented by a single male specimen. In the original description () the type locality is not clearly mentioned, and the label data is poor, "a single male in British Museum is labelled "Northern China", but was more probably taken about Shanghai, by Mr. Fortune." (). However photos of the type specimen (Fig. ) allow one to distinguish this species from closely related Metopheltes
petiolaris. In future if more representative material of Metopheltes can be collected it will be possible to clarify the status of this species and provide an identification key for the group.

Body length 11 mm. Antennal flagellum with 34 segments. Width to length ratio of scapus 0.5 (Fig. ). First flagellomere 3 times as long as wide, without distinct tyloid. Head not narrowed behind the eyes, temple rounded. Maximal length of temple 1.3 times transverse eye diameter; minimal length of temple equal to transverse eye diameter. Face as wide as longitudinal eye diameter; moderately convex, bulging; matt; densely and shallowly punctate, densely pubescent. Frontal carina between eye and antennal socket present (Fig. ). Clypeus flat, very slightly separated from face by a shallow impression; apical margin of clypeus moderately obtuse and serrate.
