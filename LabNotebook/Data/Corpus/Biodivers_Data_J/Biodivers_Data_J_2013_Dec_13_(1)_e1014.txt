Introduction
The Prespa National Park in Albania is part of Prespa International Park (here abbreviated to PIP), a region designated for nature conservation at the borders of Albania, Greece and F.Y.R. Macedonia (Fig. ). PIP lies between the geographical coordinates 40°43' to 40°51'N and 20°00' to 21°10'E and has a total surface area of 2519.1 km2 including lakes Megali and Mikri Prespa. The park is considered to be an integrated ecosystem of global significance unique for its habitats, rich floristic biodiversity and high number of local and Balkan plant endemics. According to Pavlides () the Greek part of the PIP has c. 1326 plant species, the Macedonian part c. 1597 taxa () and from current investigation, the Albanian part has at least 1130 species.

The terrestrial area of the Albanian part covers 228 km2, much of which comprises the east- and southeast-facing karstic slopes of a ridge called Mali i Thatë or Dry Mountain; this continues in Macedonia under the name Galičica Mt. The slopes of the Mikri and Megali Prespa watershed have steep inclinations of 50–85% and altitudes rising from 848 m at the lake surface to 2288 m at Pllaja e Pusit, the highest peak of Dry Mt.

Terra rossa overlying limestone covers more than 95% of the ground area and only a few hectares near Zagradeci village at Mikri Prespa are predominantly serpentine. The climate is mostly moderate-continental as in central Europe and there are Mediterranean-like warm and dry periods alternating with very cold and wet ones. The lakes, high altitude and west-facing slopes of Dry Mt play an important role in creating and influencing the sub-Mediterranean-continental character of the National Park (, ). Climate and soil composition has also favoured the development of a rich flora with Mediterranean, Balkan and Central European floristic elements. All species which are recorded in the Albanian side of the park belongs to 438 genera and 101 plant families. This constitutes nearly 33% of the total flora of Albania within such a small area of 228 km2. According to Mersinllari (), Balkan endemics account for c. 12% of the flora of Dry Mt and most of these occur in the upper montane zone. More than 30 taxa have been described from Galičica and Dry Mts, and 10–13 of these are considered restricted to Galičica Mt (Matevski 2013, pers. comm.).

Our study was based on fieldwork in the Prespa National Park, carried out jointly with Til Dieterich from Baku State University (Azerbaijan) during the years 2007, 2011 and 2012. More than 300 specimens which could not easily be named in the field were collected, identified and deposited in the herbarium of Tirana University (TIR). Relevant literature and herbarium material from JE, SKO and TIR were checked and all the species which have their locus classicus in F.Y.R. Macedonia were investigated in their original locality. The families and species in the following text are listed in alphabetical order.

Distribution
This species has been reported only from Galičica Mt. in F.Y.R. Macedonia. It has not yet been found in NW Greece.

Taxon discussion
Related to Laserpitium
siler L. particularly Laserpitiumsilersubsp.
zernyi (Hayek) Tutin from N Albania and F.Y.R. Macedonia (:31). The plant is easily distinguished by its aromatic, dissected leaves with segments 15–20 (–30) x 5–8 (–15) mm. Laserpitium
siler
subsp.
zernyi has leaves with segments 60–90 x 10–30 mm. The populations of Laserpitium
ochridanum in Dry and Ivani Mts comprise less than a hundred individuals in each locality. The discovery on Ivani Mt extends the distribution range c. 30 km south of the locus classicus. Plants on Ivani Mt are usually stemless by mid-July being bitten down by sheep and thus these populations are at risk. ― Rare, new for Albania.

Ecology
Phenology
Flowering and fruiting June to July.

Habitat
These localities are at lower altitudes (850–1200 m) and influenced by the Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean climate, and the moderating effects of the Devolli and Drini Rivers. The occurrence on the rocky calcareous cliff faces of lakes Megali and Mikri Prespa extends the distribution range eastwards towards the lakes. Allium

soskae occurs and should be looked for in the Greek part of the Prespa lakes. ― Confirmed for Albania and new for the Prespa National Park.

Distribution
Previously known only from the type locality near lake Ohrid. However, it has been reported from the western slopes of Dry Mt above Shengjergji village in Albania (:84).

Taxon discussion
In 2011, Meyer described Centaurea
decora (:167) as a new species of Centaurea from the rocky slopes above the villages of Shengjergji and Korita (Type:― Pogradec, Südabfall des Mali i Thatë, 800–1000 m, 5 July 1959, F.K. Meyer 3486 (holotype JE, digital specimen image!). We collected plants from the same slopes on 13 July 2011 and compared them with living plants of Centaurea
soskae from the locus classicus in F.Y.R. Macedonia, and concluded Centaurea
decora is identical to Centaurea
soskae.  did not mention Centaurea
soskae in his publication and probably had not seen any material of the latter to realize the two taxa are conspecific.

Ecology
Phenology
Flowering late May to mid-June, fruiting late June and July.

Habitat
Alpine and subalpine meadows overlying limestone on the rocky eastern and northeastern slopes of Dry Mt, usually between 1500 and 2000 m. At lower altitudes it occurs with Daphne
oleoides, Genista
radiata, Juniperus
communis
subsp.
alpina and Juniperus
oxycedrus. Although rare it does not seem to be under any threat as it occurs within the protected central zone of the National Park.

Distribution
The locus classicus is Mt Piperitsa which is c. 10 km south of the present Greek–F.Y.R. Macedonian border and thus still within Greek territory, and not in F.Y.R. Macedonia as attributed by Rechinger (:209). This species occurs from S and N Pindos to NC Greece and in the southern part of F.Y.R. Macedonia.

Taxon discussion
It is closely related to Alkanna
scardica (:91) from N Albania, F.Y.R. Macedonia, Kosovo and Montenegro; the latter differs by its completely eglandular indumentum, longer calyx, subglabrous corolla and distinctly reticulate nutlets. ― Rare, new to Albania.

Distribution
This species was previously thought to be a local endemic of Galičica Mt in F.Y.R. Macedonia. It has since been found on Mt Jablanica (a limestone massif east of Mt Shebeniku near the border with southwestern F.Y.R. Macedonia) and Mt Boutsi in northern Greece. It probably occurs on other limestone mountains, e.g., a collection from the summit of Mt Cajupi near Gjirokaster in southern Albania has yet to be verified. We now confirm its occurrence in Albania based on collections first made in 2007 from the central part of Dry Mt, and in 2011 from other localities on the mountain ridge. The localities in Albania adjoin those in F.Y.R. Macedonia.

Ecology
Phenology
Flowering late June to mid-July, fruiting July to August.

Habitat
In Sempervivum–Jovibarba communities on dry, stony slopes and rocky pastures of Ivani Mt and the southern part of Dry Mt, from 1546 to 2100 m. On Ivani Mt, Astragalus
mayeri occurs in clearings of Acer
heldreichii and Prunus
prostrata. On the upper slopes of Dry Mt, it occurs in rocky places and pastures together with Astragalus
angustifolius, Dianthus
cruentus, Dianthus
deltoides
subsp.
degenii, Dianthus
haematocalyx
subsp.
pindicola, Helichrysum
plicatum, Iris

subsp.
alpina and Stachys
germanica. Erodium
guicciardii, Sempervivum
ciliosum and Sideritis
raeseri occur on both sides of the Zvezda Pass which links the southern end of Dry Mt with Ivani Mt.

Distribution
Also in NC and EC Greece. Undoubtedly very close to Astragalus
sericophyllus (:52) and plants of the latter from Mt Iti in Sterea Ellas, central Greece have been reported as Astragalus
mayeri (:100). The legumes of Astragalus
mayeri are striped like a zebra as the black and white hairs are confined to patches or in separate rows instead of intermixed.

Taxon discussion
The plants of Astragalus
mayeri on Ivani Mt are more robust and larger than those from Galičica or Dry Mt especially from the latter where overgrazing is rampant and the herbaceous cover sparse. ― New for Albania.
