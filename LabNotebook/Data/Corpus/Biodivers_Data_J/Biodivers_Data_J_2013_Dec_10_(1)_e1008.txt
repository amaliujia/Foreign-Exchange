Introduction
The subfamily Acaenitinae Förster, 1869 worldwide includes about 344 species placed in 27 genera, 8 genera and 42 species of which are found in the Western Palaearctic ().

Rather little is known of the biology of acaenitines. Some Acaenitini are koinobiont endoparasitoids (, ). These authors observed that Acaenitus
dubitator (Panzer, 1800) develops as a koinobiont endoparasitoid of an endophytic curculionid. The female wasp oviposits into first and second instar host larvae and parasitization appeared to retard host development. Three ichneumonid larval instars were discerned and the final instar apparently killed its host about the time unparasitized weevil larvae were pupating. The acaenitine larva then spun a tough parchment-like cylindrical cocon within the host’s pupation chamber ().

The Ukrainian Carpathians are part of the Eastern Carpathians mountain chain and rise in the west of Ukraine within the Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Transcarpathian and Chernivtsi regions. The Carpathians of Ukraine extend from north-west to south-east as a stripe 270 km in length and 100-110 km in width. The Ukrainian Carpathians have an average height of 1000 m and the highest point is 2061 m a.s.l., with relatively soft rocks. Such high-altitude zones as foothill oak forest zone (300–400 m a.s.l.), beech forest zone (400–1300 m a.s.l.), coniferous boreal forest zone (900–1600 m a.s.l.), subalpine and alpine zone (1400–2061 m a.s.l.) can be recognised.

The Acaenitinae fauna of Ukraine is poorly studied. Up to now, there are only 10 recorded species (, , ), but there are no data about distribution of the acaenitins in the Ukrainian Carpathians, while the Romanian fauna is more species-rich and comprises 22 species (), some of which can possibly also be distributed in the Ukrainian part of the Carpathians.

Materials and methods
This study is mainly based on specimens collected by standard sweep netting in various locations in the Ukrainian Carpathians in 2009-2013. The material deposited in the collection of the Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University in Ivano-Frankivsk was also studied. The ovipositor‑hind tibia index (in text OTI), which is the length of the ovipositor projecting beyond the apex of the metasoma divided by the length of the hind tibia, is used. Terminology was  followed. Some specimens of European species of acaenitines were examined from the following collections:

HNHM: Hungarian Natural History Museum, Hungary;

ZMLU: Lunds Universitet, Zoologiska Institutionen, Sweden;

ZIN: Zoological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia.

Description
General features
Fore wing 13 mm long. Nervellus broken near the middle. Mandible with lower tooth longer than upper tooth. Flagellum with 37 segments. Head polished, face and partly clypeus with median longitudinal wrinkles. In dorsal view temples parallel behind eyes. Notauli strong. Mesopleuron, metapleuron, scutellum, mid and hind coxa and hind femur densely and clearly punctate. Metasoma polished, without well defined punctation. OTI 2.3. Hind femur robust.

Female. Head, mesosoma and metasoma black. Coloration of first and second tergites varies (see "Taxon discussion") (Fig. , , ). Clypeus and mandibles black. Flagellum black with white ring, scape and pedicel black. Legs black: all coxae, trochanters and trochantelli almost black, fore and mid tibiae and tarsi ventrally, apex of fore and mid femora, base of hind femur and tibia and tarsomeres 2–5 of hind tarsus white.

Male. Coloration as in female, but differs by face, tegula entirely andpedicel partly yellow. Flagellum yellow ventrally, without white ring. First and second tergites with wide apical light stripes (Fig. ).

Notes
The another European species, Arotes
ustulatus Kriechbaumer, 1894, differs from Arotes
albicinctus Gravenhorst, 1829 in coloration of legs (which are red except coxae) and in the possession of a fuscous spot on the apex of the fore wing.

Taxon discussion
The main distinguishing characters, between Arotes
albicinctus Gravenhorst, 1829 and Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894, given by various authors are the coloration of the first and second tergites of metasoma, which are entirely black in Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894 and light-coloured posteriorly in Arotes
albicinctus Gravenhorst, 1829, and pterostigma, which is reddish centrally in Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894 and entirely fuscous in Arotes
albicinctus Gravenhorst, 1829.  and  gave another character, the length of ovipositor sheaths, which are slightly shorter than body in Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894 and as long as the body in Arotes
albicinctus Gravenhorst, 1829.

My examination of the holotype of Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894, which is deposited at HNHM, demonstrated that the first and the second tergites have light-coloured (though very weak) posterior margins. The three of metioned above females (collected in the same locality) have first and second tergites varies from entirely black to white-striped. The coloration of the pterostigma is also varies in the studied specimens: from yellowish-brown centrally with fuscous margins to entirely fuscous. The ovipositorial sheaths are as long as the body in the specimens with black tergites, so no evident differences between the two species, Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894 and Arotes
albicinctus Gravenhorst, 1829, may be found. Arotes
annulicornis Kriechbaumer, 1894 is therefore a junior synonym (syn. nov.).

Flagellum red-brown, scape and pedicel black. Pterostigma fuscous. Legs: all coxae black, trochanters red and trochantelli, hind femur and basal half of first tergite black, hind tibia and tarsus fuscous, fore and mid femora, tibiae, tarsi and metasoma red.

Notes
There are another three species of this genus recorded so far from Ukraine, including Phaenolobus
terebrator (Scopoli, 1763) with black metasoma and red hind femora, Phaenolobus
nigripennis (Gravenhorst, 1829) with only tergites 2-4 partly red, Phaenolobus
saltans (Gravenhorst, 1829) which has prepectal carina long, almost reaching subtegular ridge.  additionally recorded another 3 new species, described from Romania, Phaenolobus
areolator (Constantineanu &amp; Constantineanu, 1968) having the entirely black flagellum and ovipositor longer than hind tibia, Phaenolobus
atrator (Constantineanu and Pisica, 1977), having the black metasoma and Phaenolobus
mucronatus (Constantineanu &amp; Constantineanu, 1968) having only tergites 2-4 partly red. But the last two species have also the second metasomal tergite with 2 oblique grooves on each side and that scaracter distinguishes these species from similar Phaenolobus
terebrator (Scopoli, 1763) and Phaenolobus
nigripennis (Gravenhorst, 1829) with the same coloration of metasoma respectively ().
