Introduction
Diptera research in Hawaii dates to the latter part of the 18th century when RCL Perkins was employed to survey the terrestrial biota of the Hawaiian Archipelago (). Subsequent research by Sweezy, Bryan, Williams, Cresson, Wirth, Hardy and others greatly expanded the number of endemic species and refined our understanding of their relationships (reviewed in ). The senior author's laboratory has been collecting Hawaiian Diptera for the past 15 years in order to elucidate the patterns and processes involved in the impressive radiations seen in these lineages in the Hawaiian Islands. We have amassed a large amount of fine-scale distributional data and new island records for many species and this is the second in a series of papers on the taxonomy and distribution of endemic Hawaiian Diptera. The current paper reports four new island records from the genus Scatella (Diptera: Ephydridae) and provides a comprehensive catalog of the available material in the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum (BPBM), University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM), and Essig Musuem of Entomology at UC Berkeley (EMEC).

Ephydridae, or the shore flies, is a cosmopolitan family of ecologically diverse acalyptrate Diptera, with 2000 species placed in five subfamilies (, ). Most ephydrids are aquatic or semi-aquatic, but some genera have adapted to harsh environments and can survive in high elevations, sulfurous hot springs, highly alkaline or saline lakes, and even in pools of crude petroleum (, ). Many ephydrids are beneficial and provide food for wildlife, such as migratory birds (). Others are agricultural pests, mining in the stems or leaves of watercress, rice, barley, and other irrigated cereals (). The majority of native Hawaiian ephydrids are placed in the cosmopolitan genus Scatella, a group containing a total of 135 species (). Scatella is widespread in the Pacific basin and it has been recorded from Hawaii, French Polynesia, Western Samoa, Australia, New Zealand, and Easter Island (). There are 17 Hawaiian species (Table ), 15 of which are endemic (). Scatella has a complex taxonomic history, particularly in Hawaii.  classified these taxa in three separate genera (Scatella, Neoscatella, and Apulvillus), but they have since been combined into the same genus. Ten species are found on multiple islands and only five (Scatellacinereifacies, Scatellakauaiensis, Scatellawilliamsi, Scatellawirthi, and Scatellafemoralis) are single island endemics ().

Materials and methods
Literature and specimen review
We have reviewed the literature for the Hawaiian Scatella and have attempted to include infomation on both the taxonomic history of the species and all occurrences of the endemic taxa in the literature, including the original descriptions, subsequent revisions, additional descriptive notes, range expansions and new island records and catalogs. We list the primary type, paratypes and other material examined. We include all records from the EMEC and the BPBM. Additional material deposited in the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution (USNM) and the UHM are also presented here. All museum abbreviations conform to .

Collection methods
All material was obtained from general sweeping of vegetation, seeps and streams. Samples were preserved in 95% ethanol (ETOH) and transported to UC Berkeley for identification and subsequent molecular work. The key and descriptions in  were used to identify the Hawaiian Scatella. Vouchers for all species were preserved in 95% ETOH and are deposited in the BPBM and EMEC.

Species distribution maps
Distribution maps for each species were produced by combining literature records and the senior author's collections during the past 15 years. Historical collections, shown in red, were georeferenced based on known place names and collection localities. These localities may not be exact but will give the reader some notion of the distribution of these taxa. Placemarks in the .kml file (Suppl. materials , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ) are named by the collector and the year of collection. Two widespread species, Scatella
sexnotata and Scatella
stagnalis, were not mapped. These taxa are very common in agricultural settings (irrigation ditches, greenhouses, etc.) and in aquatic habitats close to human habitation. More recent collections, shown in white, were georeferenced using a Garmin Oregon 450 GPS unit.

Discussion
Although Ephydridae represent only a small percentage of the Diptera diversity present in the Hawaiian Islands, these taxa are notable for exploiting aquatic environments ranging from marine to brackish swamps to high-elevation freshwater streams. Hawaiian Scatella feed on algae and microorganisms, and can be found in a range of habitats, from stagnant water in the lowlands or clean fast-running mountain streams (). Larvae of species inhabiting swift-flowing streams possess strong spines on the posterior spiracular tubes that enable the larvae to cling onto substrates of algae and rocks so they would not be dislodged by the rushing water (). In contrast, larvae of species that inhabit calm, stagnant waters do not exhibit these spines, but instead have palmate “hydrofuge” hairs surrounding the posterior spiracular openings (). When these species forage for food on the water surface, the palmate hairs spread out over the water, break the water tension, and allow the spiracles to have direct contact with the air (). It is possible that many species of Scatella, because of their ancestral ability to tolerate saline environments, can disperse across the ocean channels surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands. Because different species tend to exhibit different morphological characteristics and occupy different niche when they exist in the same area, Scatella may be another example of adaptive radiation, albeit a smaller example, in Hawaii.

Thirteen of the 17 species we treat here are widespread and found on multiple islands. This is similar to what is seen in the endemic crane flies (Dicranomyia; , ) and may be a general pattern for aquatic taxa with tolerance to salt water environments and a correspondingly higher dispersal ability than those species without such adaptations. Four species in the genus Scatella, Scatella
cinereifacies, Scatella
fluvialis, Scatella
kauaiensis, and Scatella
terryi, are single island endemics. Three of these are found at high elevations in association with fresh water, suggesting that dispersal ability has been lost or is much reduced in these species. Of the single island endemics, only Scatella
terryi is found at lower elevations in association with salt water. There are only a few known collection records of this species, all of which were made prior to 1950. It is possible that it exists on other islands but has never been collected because it is rare. It is also possible that this is truly a narrow endemic and may have been driven to the point of extinction by human activity. Many of these are in areas that are subject to high use by humans (e.g., Hanauma Bay, Waimanalo, Koko Crater). Additional collections are needed to fully assess the status of this taxon.

Distribution of Scatella species in Hawaii. Status indicates whether the species are endemic (E), introduced (I) or adventive (A). Islands sampled are: Kauai (K), Oahu (O), Molokai (Mo), Lanai (L), Maui (Ma), and Hawaii (H). Presence of a species on a given island is designated by an X. An asterisk denotes a new island record for the species. There are two species with records in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands: Scatella
sexnotata (1) has also been recorded from Nihoa, Necker and Laysan, Scatella
stagnalis (2) is known from Midway.
