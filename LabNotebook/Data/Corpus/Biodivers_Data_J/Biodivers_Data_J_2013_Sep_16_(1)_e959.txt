Introduction
In 1921, Scutellista
caerulea (Fonscolombe, 1832) was released in Nelson, New Zealand, for biological control of pest scale insects, but apparently failed to establish (, as Scutellista
cyanea). It is not considered to be present in New Zealand, and is not listed on the New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR). However, on 17 April 2013, I captured a single live female in the wild, in the grounds of the Tamaki Campus of the University of Auckland (see Fig. ). The species is so distinctive that it cannot be confused with any other, even within the genus Scutellista.

Description
The specimen was identified using , and references listed therein. I recommend that Scutellista
caerulea be added to the New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR) as exotic, present in the wild. It is unclear if the new specimen represents a descendant of the original stock released in Nelson in 1921, or a new incursion from overseas. The balance of evidence favours the latter hypothesis, since Auckland is far from Nelson, and the species has not been seen in N.Z. for nearly a century.
