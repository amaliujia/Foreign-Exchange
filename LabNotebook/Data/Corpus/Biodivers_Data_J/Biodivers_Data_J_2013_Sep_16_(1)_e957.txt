Introduction
The family Paradoxosomatidae is one of the largest and the most diverse in Diplopoda, and it has long been known to dominate the fauna of the Indo-Australian region (). However, only very few paradoxosomatid species have hitherto been recorded in the Philippines. Among them is an unidentified species of the large, mostly Papuan genus Eustrongylosoma Silvestri, 1896, reported by  from Mindanao. The present paper reviews and updates the paradoxosomatid fauna of the Philippines, including a description of the first Philippine Eustrongylosoma. The checklist presented below is highly condensed and skeletal on purpose, because a complete catalogue of the Diplopoda of the Philippines is in preparation (Korsós, pers. comm.). Here we also provide descriptive notes on the Southeast Asian species Anoplodesmus
anthracinus Pocock, 1895, hitherto known only from Myanmar, but currently found in Malaysia and Sri Lanka as well.

Most of the material is housed in the collection of Diplopoda of the National Museum of Natural History, Sofia (NMNHS), with only a single paratype of Eustrongylosoma
penevi sp. n. donated to the Zoological Museum, Moscow State University, Russia (ZMUM), as indicated hereafter.

Description
Length 18-22 (♂) or 23 mm (♀), width of midbody pro- and metazona 1.1-1.3 and 1.5-1.7 mm (♂), or 1.9 and 2.1 mm (♀), respectively. Holotype ca 22 mm long, width of pro- and metazona 1.3 and 1.6 mm, respectively. Coloration black to light grey-brown (Fig. ). Pattern mostly cingulate due to a large light grey band on prozona dorsally in front of stricture extending down until level of paraterga (Fig. , ). Legs light grey-brown. Antennae increasingly infuscate distad, from light brown to blackish (Fig. ).

Body submoniliform. Antennomeres 2 to 6 subequal in length, antennae rather short, reaching behind segment 3 (♂) or 2 (♀) when stretched dorsally. Tegument generally smooth and shining. In width, segments 2 and 3 &lt; collum = 4 &lt; 5-17, thereafter body gently tapering towards telson. Paraterga (Fig. , , ) modestly developed, keel-shaped, set low (at about 1/3rd of metazonal height), thinner in poreless, thicker in pore-bearing, segments, slightly reaching behind tergal margin only in segments 2 and 17-19, mostly slightly pointed, delimited by a complete and deep sulcus only dorsally, ventral sulcus being incomplete, developed only in posterior quarter to 1/5th extent. Head densely setose on clypeus and frons, bare on vertex. Collum semilunar, bearing two transverse rows of 2+2 setae, one row along front margin, second row in the middle; lateral edges broadly rounded. Metaterga faintly rugulose, a little more clearly so in postsulcus halves, surface below paraterga microgranular in segments 2-7. Tergal setae rather long, about 1/5th of metatergal length, arranged in two rows of 2+2 in each, one in front of, second behind sulcus. Sulcus starting from segment 5, deep, almost reaching the bases of paraterga. Stricture between pro- and metazona finely and densely ribbed. Ozopores lying close to caudal end of paraterga in a shallow ovoid groove, lateral, only partly visible from above. Pleurosternal carinae poorly developed ridges visible only in segments 2-4. Seta at about midway of each paratergum mostly broken off. Axial line wanting. Epiproct (Fig. ) subtruncate, pre-apical lateral papillae small. Hypoproct (Fig. ) semi-circular. Sternal lobe between coxae 4 subtrapeziform, densely setose (Fig. ). Legs very long and slender, about 2.0 (♂) or 1.3 (♀) times as long as midbody height; ♂ tarsal brushes traceable until about legs of segment 15, thereafter thinning out.

Gonopods rather simple (Fig. , , ): coxite long, subcylindrical, bare; prefemoral portion small, about 1/3rd as long as femorite, the latter slender, ventral lobe somewhat better developed than dorsal one, apicolateral lobe (l) rounded, well developed, with a long transverse spine (s) at base. Solenophore subcircular, with a subterminal lobule.

Diagnosis
Most similar to Eustrongylosoma
exiguum Hoffman, 1978, from Papua New Guinea, and Eustrongylosoma
kuekenthali (Attems, 1897), from Borneo and Sulawesi, sharing the presence of a prominent distal spine on the gonopod femorite. Different from all congeners by the transverse orientation of the spine and noticeably long legs in the male (, ).

Etymology
Honours our good friend and colleague Lyubomir Penev, biologist and founder of the Biodiversity Data Journal and Pensoft Publishers.

Notes
The species is hitherto known only from its type locality, Mt Polis Checkpoint on the road Banaue – Sagada (Fig. ), where it was found close to a human settlement, under wooden plates and logs (Fig. ).

Description
Length ca 33 mm, width of pro- and metazona 2.8 and 3.8 mm, respectively (♂), or 25, 3.0 and 4.0 mm, respectively (♀). Colour pattern highly vivid (Fig. ), shiny blackish to dark brown, with contrasting yellowish paraterga and the immediately adjacent regions. Paraterga very well-developed, set rather high (about 1/4th of midbody height) (Fig. ), callus wide (Fig. ), thicker in pore-bearing paraterga. Pleurosternal carinae longitudinally arched ribs, increasingly poorly developed towards telson to totally disappear in segment 15. Legs only slightly enlarged in male, rather long and slender, about 1.3 (♂) or 0.9 (♀) times as long as midbody height. ♂ legs 5 (Fig. ) and 6 with large femoral humps, ♂ femur 7 with a humped process even greater than in leg 6 (Fig. ). Epiproct subtruncate (Fig. ). Hypoproct roundly subtrapeziform (Fig. ). Sternal lamina between ♂ coxae 4 semi-circular (Fig. ).

Gonopods very simple (Fig. ): coxite with a few strong setae distodorsally, prefemoral part prominent, only slightly shorter than acropodite; femorite with a strong ventral tooth (a), solenophore bipartite, with two apical lobes (b, c), lobe c supporting a short solenomere (sl).

Notes
This species was originally described from Yangon (= Rangoon), Myanmar ().  synonymized it with Jonespeltis
splendidus Verhoeff, 1936, from southern India, but  revalidated the latter species and returned Anoplodesmus
anthracinus to its original scope. Furthermore, Jeekel provided very useful illustrations and a detailed redescription of the species, based on a part of the type series.  gave more illustrations of the gonopods, based on a paratype of Anoplodesmus
kathanus (Chamberlin, 1921), from Katha, north of Yangon, Myanmar, and synonymized it with Anoplodesmus
anthracinus.

Our record of Anoplodesmus
anthracinus in the State of Pulau Penang, Malaysia considerably extends the range of this species to the south. The studied sample agrees well with the description provided by  and  in most characters (Figs , ), including humps in ♂ femora 5 and 6, as well as a process surmounting a hump in ♂ femur 7. Only slight variations have been noticed in the shapes of paraterga and sternal lobe between ♂ coxae 4. The same can be said about the samples from Sri Lanka which are also identified as Anoplodesmus
anthracinus.

These are the first formal records of the species in Malaysia and Sri Lanka (Figs , ). However, actually they might well represent introductions. In fact, in Malaysia the species was observed and collected in a highly agricultural and urbanized area, in close proximity to experimental rice fields (Fig. ), while in Sri Lanka, the collecting locality is a human settlement.

It is noteworthy that Sri Lanka hosts several formal species of Anoplodesmus, nearly all very similar to one another:

Anoplodesmus
saussurii (Humbert, 1865), originally described from Sri Lanka, later recorded also in Fiji and Mauritius (, , ). The only meaningful difference from Anoplodesmus
anthracinus is said to lie in the absence of a ventral hump in ♂ femur 5. However, given considerable variation in the presence or absence of this character, when such a hump in Anoplodesmus
anthracinus can either be present in or absent from ♂ femur 4 (, ), its status versus the older name Anoplodesmus
saussurii is to be questioned.

Anoplodesmus
luctuosus (Peters, 1864), from Rambodde; Anoplodesmus
inornatus (Humbert, 1865), Anoplodesmus
layardi (Humbert, 1865), Anoplodesmus
thwaitesii (Humbert, 1865) and Anoplodesmus
humberti (Carl, 1902), all from Paradeniya; and Anoplodesmus
sabulosus Attems, 1898, from Kandy. All of them have been described from Sri Lanka, still known only from that island. Some of these taxa are however dubious, being based on female or even juvenile material, but most could be included into a key (). Regrettably, the first couplet in the key is purely geographic, separating the species from Myanmar and Sumatra from those described from Sri Lanka and India (). As one can see from the presently known distributions of Anoplodesmus
saussurii and Anoplodesmus
anthracinus, this distinction does not hold, also strongly suggesting several introductions through human agency. The only feasible solution lies in collecting new and/or spotting topotypic museum samples of the still enigmatic Anoplodesmus
inornatus and Anoplodesmus
layardi from Paradeniya, and of Anoplodesmus
sabulosus from Kandy, to properly compare them to their type material. In addition, bar-coding could help tracing genetic relationships. Last, but not least, a few congeneric species, most of which also very similar to Anoplodesmus
anthracinus, are known to occur in southern India as well.

Since Anoplodesmus is a senior synonym of Paranedyopus (, ), the sole erstwhile component species of the latter genus from Sri Lanka, Anoplodesmus
simplex (Humbert, 1865), from Pundaloya (), must be considered as well. However, like any former Paranedyopus species, Anoplodesmus
simplex shows reduced paraterga and more elaborate gonopods (). In other words, Anoplodesmus
simplex is quite distinct from the above congeners from Sri Lanka which all have strongly developed paraterga and highly simple gonopods. In contrast, it seems to be more similar to Anoplodesmus
rufocinctus (Carl, 1932) and Anoplodesmus
subcylindricus (Carl, 1932), both latter taxa from southern India ().

Euphyodesmus
philippina
(Nguyen Duc &amp; Sierwald, 2010), comb. n.

Notes
The identity of this species, described from Palawan Island in the genus Desmoxytes Chamberlin, 1923 (), has recently been discussed and shown to actually represent the basically Australian subfamily Australiosomatinae (). The species has thereby remained referred to as “Desmoxytes” philippina, the genus name being put in quotation marks to emphasize the wrong original assignment. Here we take the opportunity to allocate it properly at least at the subfamily level, choosing the Bornean Euphyodesmus as perhaps the best candidate genus ().

Luzonomorpha
acutangula
(Newport, 1844)

Notes
Described as Polydesmus
acutangulus from an unspecified locality in the Philippines, it has sometimes been quoted in the original spelling (e.g. ), but we prefer to follow , who clearly spelled the name in the feminine gender.

Luzonomorpha

Luzonomorpha
polilloensis
(San Juan &amp; Lit, 2010), comb. n.

Notes
Known from Polillo Island (). This species was originally assigned to Prionopeltis Pocock, 1895, a genus long known to be invalid (). In fact it definitely belongs to Luzonomorpha.

Luzonomorpha
quatuorputeus
(Wang, 1951)

Notes
Known both from Mindanao and Luzon islands.

Orthomorpha
coarctata
(De Saussure, 1860)

Notes
This pantropical, definitely anthropochore species has often been referred to as a distinct genus, Asiomorpha Verhoeff, 1939, but we prefer to regard Orthomorpha
coarctata as a species of Orthomorpha (see ). In the Philippines, it has been recorded in Mactan and Cebu islands ().

Helicorthomorpha Type-species: Strongylosoma
holstii Pocock, 1895

Helicorthomorpha
luzoniensis
(Peters, 1864), comb. n.

Notes
Originally described from Luzon, without a more precise locality (), this species, previously considered dubious (), appears to actually represent a new senior subjective synonym of Helicorthomorpha
orthogona (Silvestri, 1898). The syntypes (1 ♂, 1 ♀), labelled "Bosoboso, Luzon, leg. Martens" (), have been revised and returned to the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin as а lectotype (♂) and а paralectotype (♀). Lectotype designation is necessary to ensure the species to be based on male material. In addition, unlike the paralectotype, which is an incomplete female, the lectotype is complete. The name luzoniensis is preferred because of its priority, being in use in the last 50 years and thus not representing a nomen oblitum (). This widespread species, previously referred to as Helicorthomorpha
orthogona, is known to occur from China to New Guinea (). In the Philippines it has been recorded from Luzon and Mindanao islands (, ).

Species incertae sedis
Orthomorpha
bisulcata
Pocock, 1895

Notes
This species, originally described from Myanmar (), has been recorded under this name from the Philippines, based on material shipped from the Philippines and intercepted by quarantine in the Hawaiis (). Because that material contained only females, the identification seems to be highly dubious, better to be ignored altogether.
