Introduction
In their revision of the triggerfish genus Xanthichthys Kaup in ,  recognized five distinct species within this genus: the Atlantic Xanthichthys
ringens (); the Indo-Pacific Xanthichthys
lineopunctatus (), Xanthichthys
caeruleolineatus, and Xanthichthys
auromarginatus (); and the Pacific Xanthichthys
mento (). In July 2005, the authors, accompanied by Brian D. Greene, conducted a series of deep exploratory dives using rebreathers to assess the deep reef (mesophotic) fish fauna off the north and west shores of Kiritimati (Christmas Island, Line Islands). Among several undescribed species of fishes observed or collected below 80-85 m off the Captain Cook Hotel on the north shore of Kiritimati were six specimens of a new species of Xanthichthys. Numerous other individuals of this new triggerfish were observed, and the collected specimens are representative of the size range of observed individuals. All individuals of this new species were encountered at depths of 90-100 m, below a strong thermocline at a variable depth of 80-85 m (the water temperature was approximately 25-28°C above the thermocline, and approximately 20-22°C below). The habitat consisted of a slightly downward sloping hard substratum with patches of rocks approximately 15-30 cm in size, with occasional small holes providing habitat and cover for fishes. At 100 m the slope transitioned to a vertical wall approximately 4 m high, with another thermocline and a steep downward slope below this wall in very cold water (approximately 10-14°C). No Xanthichthys were observed associated with or below this wall, or above the 80-85 meter thermocline. However within these depth parameters, a narrow band of approximately 30 m width, the Xanthichthys species appeared to be common.

Materials and methods
Deep dives were made using Cis-Lunar Mk-5P mixed-gas, closed-circuit rebreathers. Specimens were collected by hand and by hand net.

Counts and measurements follow the methods described by  in their revision of the genus. Body-scale rows were counted from the upper end of the gill opening to the caudal base. These counts include the diagonal rows of small scales just behind the gill opening. Head-scale rows were counted from just posterior to the corner of the mouth to the upper end of the gill opening. This count includes small scales at either end. Because scales on the head were not in perfect alignment and because of intercalated rows, precise and consistent head-scale rows were difficult to obtain. We follow  in excluding gill raker counts, both because this count is inconclusive for differentiating species within the genus, and because of the necessity to damage specimens to access gill rakers.

Standard length 

(SL) was measured from the tip of the snout to the caudal base. Depth of body, width of body, head length, snout length, tip of snout to origins of first dorsal and anal fins, and length of second dorsal-fin and anal-fin bases, eye diameter, interorbital width, length of gill opening, depth of caudal peduncle, length of first dorsal spine, length of longest dorsal soft ray, length of longest anal ray, interdorsal space, length of caudal fin, caudal concavity, and length of pectoral fin are expressed as percent of SL. Head length was measured from the tip of the snout to the upper end of the gill opening.

Maximum depth measurement may be variable due to the degree of extension of the pelvic flap when the individual specimen was preserved. Width of the body is the maximum width. Depth of the caudal peduncle is the least depth. Eye diameter is the maximum fleshy diameter. Interorbital width is the least bony width. Interdorsal space is the distance from the posterior edge of the first dorsal spine at its base to the origin of the first ray of the second dorsal fin (excluding the basal scaly sheath). Measurement of the longest ray of the second dorsal and anal fins exclude the basal scaly sheath. Bases of the second dorsal and anal fins were measured from the anterior margin of the first ray at the upper end of the basal scaly sheath to the posterior edge of the last ray. Caudal concavity is the horizontal distance between the distal tips of the longest and shortest caudal rays.

Tissue samples intended for DNA sequencing were removed from collected specimens prior to formalin fixation in the field, but these tissue samples were subsequently lost in transit. Description of this species was postponed for eight years in anticipation of obtaining additional specimens from Kiritimati or other nearby localities, but following exploration of similar habitats in French Polynesia, the Cook Islands, and Johnston Atoll without observing this species, we have elected to describe this new species without molecular analysis.

The holotype has been deposited at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum fish collection, Honolulu (BPBM); and paratypes have been deposited at BPBM, the California Academy of Sciences fish collection, San Francisco 

(CAS), and the U.S. National Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C. 

(USNM).

Etymology
Named for Brian D. Greene, a member of the deep diving team that discovered species, in recognition of his efforts to collect the type specimens.

Ecology
Relatively abundant within its depth range and habitat (coral rubble and holes adjacent to deeper drop-offs, below a thermocline) at several localities on the west and north coasts of Kiritimati (Christmas Island). Always observed near the reef substratum, where it would retreat to shelter when approached.

Distribution
Currently known only from Kiritimati (Christmas Island) in the Line Islands. Further exploration of mesophotic coral ecosystems in the tropical Pacific may extend the known range of this species, although it was not observed during exploratory dives within the mesophotic depth range in the Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Atoll, Caroline Islands, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, or elsewhere in the Pacific.

Identification Keys
Revised Key to the Species of Xanthichthys
1	Cheek with three prominent slightly diagonal dark brown or blue grooves (a shorter narrower groove above and below the main three sometimes dark on Xanthichthys
lineopunctatus), extending from just behind and below corner of mouth nearly to gill opening; body with dark longitudinal lines and/or spots		
–	Cheek with five or six grooves (darkly pigmentd only on Xanthichthys
mento; poorly developed on Xanthichthys
auromarginatus); body without dark longitudinal lines and spots except males of Xanthichthys
mento with a small light blue spot in scale centers that may be brown in preservative (in addition, a concentration of dark pigment corners of the scales of some specimens of Xanthichthys
mento, giving a dark-spotted effect)		
2	Lines or spots on body scales; scale rows between upper end of gill opening and caudal base 39-50		
–	Lines or spots on body restricted to row of brown spots dorsally; scale rows between upper end of gill opening and caudal base 33-35 (Line Islands)	Xanthichthys
greenei, new species	
3	Body with a single round to longitudinally elliptical dark brown spot at corner of each scale; scales between upper end of gill opening and caudal fin base 39 to 44 (tropical Atlantic)	Xanthichthys
ringens

Based on the key included in .

Discussion
Table  compares Xanthichthys species using counts from  and counts we have made for Xanthichthys
greenei. The six known Xanthichthys species can be separated into two groups according to the number of cheek grooves, 3 or 5-6. Xanthichthys
ringens, Xanthichthys
lineopunctatus and Xanthichthys
greenei all have three pigmented cheek grooves and share similarities in color pattern. Color of the caudal fin, soft dorsal and anal fin is nearly identical in these three species. However in Xanthichthys
greenei the body spots of Xanthichthys
ringens and the spots and lines of Xanthichthys
lineopunctatus are reduced to a few spots dorsally. Another difference is that the base of the second dorsal and anal fins of Xanthichthys
greenei is not darkly pigmented as it is on the other two species. Xanthichthys
greenei can also be separated from these two species and from all other Xanthichthys species by its low body scale row count, which has no overlap with any other Xanthichthys. Moreover, it appears to be a small species, and the size of the holotype at 154 mm SL, as large as any we observed underwater, is considerably smaller than the maximum size recorded for the next smallest species (Xanthichthys
auromarginatus at 227 mm).

While Xanthichthys
greenei has only been recorded from Kiritimati, we would expect it to be present in suitable habitat throughout the northern Line Islands, possibly the southern Line Islands (but the junior author has noted faunal differences between the northern and southern Line Islands), and perhaps the Phoenix Islands. Although the habitat of Xanthichthys
greenei is below normal scuba diving depths and the species could be missed by divers, Balistidae can be readily caught by hook and line from deep water by local fishermen. Since this species has not been recorded from French Polynesia or other heavily fished areas in the Central Pacific (despite comparable observations at similar depths and habitats using mixed-gas rebreathers), we are inclined to doubt its presence there.
