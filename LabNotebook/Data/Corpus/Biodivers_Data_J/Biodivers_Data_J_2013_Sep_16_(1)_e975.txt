Introduction
Echinorhynchus
bothniensis Zdzitowiecki &amp; Valtonen, 1987 was originally described from Osmerus
eperlanus L. from the oligohaline waters of the Bothnian Bay, northern Baltic. In earlier studies (, , ) this acanthocephalan had been determined as Echinorhynchus
gadi Zoega in Müller, 1776 (see ). The first evidence that Echinorhynchus 'gadi' in Osmerus
eperlanus was biologically distinct from Echinorhynchus
gadi in Gadus
morhua L. and other marine fish came from amphipod infection experiments; acanthors of Echinorhynchus
gadi from Baltic Gadus
morhua were infective to Gammarus
zaddachi Sexton, but acanthors of Echinorhynchus 'gadi' from Osmerus
eperlanus were not (). Moreover,  noted that the mature females of Echinorhynchus 'gadi' from Osmerus
eperlanus were smaller than the mature females of Echinorhynchus
gadi found in Gadus
morhua. A detailed morphological study by  revealed marked differences in egg dimensions between Echinorhynchus 'gadi' from Osmerus
eperlanus and Echinorhynchus
gadi from Gadus
morhua. Furthermore, male Echinorhynchus 'gadi' from Osmerus
eperlanus tended to exhibit one or more pairs of parallel cement glands in contrast to the moniliform pattern displayed by Echinorhynchus
gadi from Gadus
morhua, although there was some interspecific overlap in cement gland arrangement. On the basis of these morphological differences  accorded specific rank to Echinorhynchus 'gadi' from Osmerus
eperlanus by naming it Echinorhynchus
bothniensis. Other true definitive hosts (i.e. hosts in which gravid female worms have been found) of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis from the Bothnian Bay include Lampetra
fluviatilis (L.), Salmo
trutta L., Lota
lota (L.), Myoxocephalus
quadricornis (L.) and Platichthys
flesus (L.) (). The intermediate hosts belongs to the Mysis
relicta Lovén (Mysidacea) species group (). It is important to note that this species group has recently been split, on the basis of molecular and morphological characters () into four named taxa: Mysis
relicta (sensu stricto), Mysis
salemaai Audzijonyte &amp; Väinölä, 2005, Mysis
segerstralei Audzijonyte &amp; Väinölä, 2005 and Mysis
diluviana Audzijonyte &amp; Väinölä, 2005.

Using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis  demonstrated that not only is Echinorhynchus
bothniensis heterospecific to Echinorhynchus
gadi, but that both taxa represent complexes of sibling species. One species of the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group was found in Osmerus
eperlanus from the Bothnian Bay and in Osmerus
eperlanus and Mysis
relicta (sensu stricto) (as Mysis
relicta sp. I sensu ) from Lake Keitele, central Finland.  referred to this species as Echinorhynchus
bothniensis, since its range included the type-locality. A second species found in Coregonus
lavaretus (L.), Platichthys
flesus (L.), Salvelinus
alpinus (L.) and Mysis
segerstralei Audzijonyte &amp; Väinölä, 2005 (as Mysis
relicta sp. III sensu ) from Lake Pulmankijärvi, northern Finland was designated Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' (). Neither of the lacustrine populations of the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group have previously been studied morphologically.

Echinorhynchus
bothniensis is morphologically very similar to the North American Echinorhynchus
leidyi Van Cleave, 1924 (= Echinorhynchus
salvelini Linkins in Ward &amp; Whipple, 1918 nec Schrank, 1788), but apparently differs slightly from the latter species in hook formula and cement gland arrangement (). Mysis
relicta (sensu lato) is reported as the intermediate host of Echinorhynchus
leidyi (, ). More precisely, these intermediate host records for Nearctic Echinorhynchus
leidyi will correspond to Mysis
segerstralei and/or Mysis
diluviana; Mysis
relicta sensu stricto appears to be confined to north European fresh and brackish waters (). Definitive hosts include salmonid and coregonid fishes.  postulated that the common usage of Mysis
relicta group species as intermediate hosts defines Echinorhynchus
leidyi and the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group as a clade of closely related species, because the known life cycles of all other Echinorhynchus spp. involve an amphipod intermediate host. Furthermore, these authors advanced an hypothesis of co-speciation of the acanthocephalans with their mysid hosts.

Both Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus
leidyi have a similar hooks formula and cement gland arrangement to a congener, Echinorhynchus
truttae Schrank, 1788 found in salmoniform fishes of the Palaearctic. Echinorhynchus
truttae utilises an amphipod (Gammarus
pulex (L.)), rather than a mysid, as an intermediate host () and so is apparently biologically distinct from the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group and Echinorhynchus
leidyi.  reported that Echinorhynchus
bothniensis could be distinguished from Echinorhynchus
truttae, because the latter has a longer proboscis and much shorter eggs. However, the diagnostic value of these characters was equivocal, since anatomical variability in Echinorhynchus
truttae had never been assessed. The means to discriminate between the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group and Echinorhynchus
truttae is of real significance to workers conducting faunistic surveys or other studies on these acanthocephalans. The two taxa share some of the same species of definitive host (e.g.Salmo
trutta) (see , ) and may well occur in sympatry, since their intermediate hosts have overlapping geographical ranges in northern Europe (see , ).

Echinorhynchus
truttae is typically a parasite of salmoniform fishes and has been reported from a variety of species including Salmo
trutta (e.g.), Salvelinus
alpinus (e.g.), Salvelinus
leucomaenis (Pallas) (), Coregonus
lavaretus (e.g.), Thymallus
thymallus (L.) (e.g. ), Thymallus
arcticus
baicalensis Dybowski (, ) and Oncorhynchus
mykiss (Walbaum) (, ). Echinorhynchus
truttae is found throughout Europe (including Ireland and the British Isles) and its range extends across Siberia all the way to the Bering Straits ().  suggested that Echinorhynchus
truttae (sensu ) from the Kurile Islands, northwest Pacific, may be another species.

The principal aims of the present study were: (i) to ascertain whether the two sibling species of the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group can be distinguished from each other, and from Echinorhynchus
leidyi, using morphological characters; (ii) to review the taxonomy of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis'; (iii) to quantify morphological variability in Echinorhynchus
truttae; and (iv) to identify the best characters for discriminating this taxon from the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis sibling species and Echinorhynchus
leidyi. Additionally, some observations on the ecology of Echinorhynchus
truttae are reported.

Material and methods
Material
Table  provides a detailed list of all material studied, including accession numbers. A total of 19 specimens (7 males; 12 females) of Echinorhynchus
truttae were collected from wild brown trout (Salmo
trutta L.) from two streams (Loch Walton Burn and Loch Coulter Burn) in the River Carron catchment, central Scotland. The fish were caught by electro-fishing and were transported live to the laboratory where they were killed by a blow to the head and examined for acanthocephalan infection within 24 hours. Acanthocephalans found were washed and relaxed in refrigerated distilled water before being fixed in 75% alcohol. These acanthocephalans were identified as Echinorhynchus
truttae using the keys in . They were judged to be Echinorhynchus
truttae, rather than members of the morphogically similar Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group or Echinorhynchus
leidyi, because the lotic environment they were collected from is unlikely to support populations of the lentic Mysis
relicta, the intermediate host of the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group. Furthermore, the trout sampled were in their first year of life and so were unlikely to have spent any time outside their natal stream where they might potentially have been infected with Echinorhynchus
bothniensis.

A series of Echinorhynchus
truttae (74 specimens; 45 females; 29 males) collected by Dr A Pike, University of Aberdeen, from Salmo
trutta from Drummore, on the south-west coast of Scotland, held in the spirit collection of the Natural History Museum was also studied. Most of these acanthocephalans had well everted probosces and displayed no tegumental folding, suggesting that they had been relaxed in water before being fixed.

All of the specimens of the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis group studied were collected between 1985 and 1997 by Professor E. T. Valtonen of the University of Jyväskylä and deposited in the spirit collection of The Natural History Museum. Some of this material had been fully relaxed in water prior to fixation. Most of the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis material came from one host species, Osmerus
eperlanus, from the freshwater Lake Keitele, central Finland. This population of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis is thought to have been isolated from conspecifics in the Bothnian Bay for at least 6,000 years (). Five paratypes of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis (BM(NH) 1987.1070-1074) from Osmerus
eperlanus from the Bothnian Bay were also examined, but only one female worm was in a suitable condition for measuring hook morphometrics.

Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' is known only from Lake Pulmankijärvi in northern Lapland, on the Finnish-Norwegian border. This freshwater lake lies 17 metres above sea level and drains into the Barents Sea. Samples of Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' were obtained from the following hosts: Salvelinus
alpinus (L.), Coregonus
lavaretus (L.) and Platichthys
flesus (L.).

In addition to the northern European material described above, voucher specimens of the Nearctic Echinorhynchus
leidyi from the Canadian Museum of Nature were also examined. These acanthocephalans were collected by  during their extensive survey of morphological variability in Echinorhynchus
gadi, Echinorhynchus
leidyi and Echinorhynchus
salmonis Müller, 1784 from northern Canada.

Light Microscopy
The specimens of Echinorhynchus
leidyi from the Canadian Museum of Nature had been fixed in formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA), stained with Semichon's carmine and permanently mounted in Permount (Fisher Scientific). All other acanthocephalans were prepared for light microscopy by dehydration through an alcohol series followed by clearing in lactophenol. Measurements were made with aid of a digitizing tablet (KS 100, Version 3, Carl Zeiss Vision). Hook morphometric data were recorded from one longitudinal row in which all of the hooks were visible in profile using the method described by . Morphometric and meristic data were collected during a PhD studentship ().

Morphological Data Analysis
Statistical analysis and visualization of morphometric and meristic data were performed using the R language and environment (). Boxplots augmented with strip charts were created using the R package beeswarm (). Proboscis profiler () was used to analyse both intra and interspecific variation in hook measurements. Proboscis profiler, based on the meristogram of , was developed to detect morphological heterogeneity in collections of superficially similar acanthocephalan worms based on the multivariate statistical analysis of proboscis hook dimensions. For a detailed description of this tool with examples, please refer to . In brief, the Proboscis profiler algorithm is composed of the following sequential steps:

Proboscis profiler requires blade length and base width measurements from each of the hooks in at least one longitudinal row of hooks per specimen. In each longitudinal row hooks are numbered sequentially, starting with the most distal hook.

Hook position is standardized. Counted position number of each hook in a given row is multiplied by 100 and divided by n + 1, where n = the total number of hooks in the row and the constant 1 is a corrective factor for centring the data-points in graphs.

A moving average (arithmetic mean) routine is applied to the data from each row of hooks and considers a user-defined segment of the percent-position axis for each measurement (length and base). The segment advances through the data from anterior to posterior in 1% increments.

Unsupervised pattern recognition using principal component analysis.

Hierarchical clustering of the first two principal components from step 4.

Ecological Data Analysis
For each of the two host populations studied (Loch Walton Burn and Loch Coulter Burn), Quantitative Parasitology (, ) was used to calculate an exact confidence interval for the prevalence of infection (using the Sterne method), a bootstrap confidence interval for mean abundance and the aggregation index (variance/mean). The R package fitdistrplus () was used to determine whether a Poisson or a negative binomial distribution provided the best description of the occurrence of Echinorhynchus
truttae in its definitive host populations.

Results
Variation in conventional morphological characters
Initially an assessment was made of intraspecific and interspecific variation in conventional morphological characters, i.e. those characters used by most acanthocephalan taxonomists in the differential diagnosis of Echinorhynchus species. Summaries of these variables for the female and male acanthocephalans examined in this study are provided in Tables ,  respectively. Data for the three Echinorhynchus
truttae populations (Loch Walton Burn, Loch Coulter Burn and Drummore) have been pooled, because, in the absence of any inter-site morphological variability, these acanthocephalans were assumed to be conspecific. Additionally, for comparative purposes, Tables ,  contain data for Echinorhynchus
bothniensis from Osmerus
eperlanus in the Bothnian Bay (original description by ) and an extensive collection of Echinorhynchus
leidyi from various fishes across northern Canadian waters (). It is important to note that these additional data were recorded from acanthocephalans prepared for light microscopy using methods different from those employed in the current study, although in all studies acanthocephalans were relaxed in fresh water prior to fixation to evert proboscides.  fixed their samples of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis in alcohol and examined them as wet mounts, similarly to the current study, however they used creosote rather than lactophenol as a clearing agent. By contrast,  fixed their samples in formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (FAA), stained them with acetocarmine and mounted them in synthetic resin.

The extent of intraspecific morphological variability for the taxa studied can be seen in Tables , . The mean and range of values for each morphometric are very similar for both Echinorhynchus
bothniensis population, i.e. the Bothnian Bay and Lake Keitele. An analysis of the cause of intraspecific variation in morphological characters was attempted for Echinorhynchus
truttae only, as sample numbers for the other taxa were considered to be too small for a meaningful statistical analysis. All anatomical characters common to both sexes are larger in females than males (compare data in tables Tables ,  and also see boxplots in Suppl. material ). Sexual dimporphism is also clearly apparent in a principal components analysis of conventional morphological characters (Fig. ). There is considerable separation of females from males in the first principal component, which accounts for 36% of the variation in the dataset. The variables contributing most to the separation of the two sexes (i.e. those with the highest loadings for principal component one) are: lemniscus length, proboscis receptacle length and width, body length and proboscis length and width (Fig. ). Body size is positively correlated (Bonferroni corrected p-value &lt; 0.05) with the size of several anatomical characters of female Echinorhynchus
truttae (Table ), namely, body width (r2=0.257), proboscis length (r2=0.317), proboscis receptacle length (r2=0.284), lemniscus length (r2=0.364), lemniscus width (r2=0.237), vagina width (r2=0.246) and vaginal sphincter width (r2=0.251). In male Echinorhynchus
truttae (Table ), a significant positive correlation with body length is only demonstrated for the length of the reproductive system (r2= 0.876), lemniscus length (r2=0.487) and the length of the testes (r2=0.346 for anterior testis; r2=0.469 for posterior testis). Evidence of morphological variation in Echinorhynchus
truttae between the three sample sites was not found, even after taking sexual dimorphism into account.

Although there are interspecific differences in the means of some of the morphometric variables (e.g. maximum length of hook blade) listed in Tables , , interspecific overlap in their ranges prevents any single morphometric variable from being used to reliably discriminate any of the species in this study. For a graphical representation of interspecific variation in each conventional morphological character, see boxplots in Suppl. materials , .

Marked intraspecific, but subtle interspecific anatomic variation was observed in the male reproductive system. Four of 32 male Echinorhynchus
truttae had only one testis, which measured 793–1530 × 393–730µm. No monorchid males were found in Echinorhynchus
bothniensis or Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis'. All of the Echinorhynchus spp. studied typically displayed six cement glands, but the number of glands was variable in Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' and Echinorhynchus
truttae. Of eleven specimens of Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis', nine (82%) exhibited six cement glands, but two (18%) had only five. Cement gland number was recorded from 35 male Echinorhynchus
truttae; the numbers displaying 4, 5, 6 and 8 cement glands were 1 (3%), 3 (9%), 30 (86%) and 1 (3%), respectively. Cement gland arrangements of specimens with six glands are summarized in Table . It is interesting to note that none of the specimens of Echinorhynchus
truttae were found to exhibit the moniliform pattern (chain-like, six singles) and that the majority (96%) had either one or two paired cement glands. This is in contrast to the other taxa, where a large proportion of the males (21–57%) display the moniliform pattern. In Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' pairs of cement glands consisted of the third and fourth, or fourth and fifth glands from the anterior. In Echinorhynchus
bothniensis pairs were made up of any two adjacent cement glands (i.e. first and second, second and third, third and fourth, fourth and fifth or fifth and sixth).

Proboscis profiles
Before attempting to use the Proboscis Profiler to discriminate taxa, potential confounding variables should be considered. Preparation is one such problem (Palaearctic samples fixed in alchol, then cleared and temporarily mounted in lactophenol vs Nearctic samples fixed in FAA, stained with acetocarmine and permanently mounted in synthentic resin), but cannot be controlled in this analysis. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when making comparisons between Echinorhynchus
leidyi and the other taxa. Radial asymmetry of proboscis hooks is another potential problem (). Unfortunately, the importance of radial asymmetry was not known at the time of data collection and so no record was made of which surface of the proboscis (dorsal, ventral or lateral) the measured hooks were situated. One confounding factor which can be measured and, if necessary, controlled (by profiling females and males separately) is sexual dimorphism. This phenomenon was investigated in Echinorhynchus
truttae, because hook data from a complete longitudinal row are available (Suppl. materials , ) for a relatively large number of both female (n=46) and male (n=26) acanthocephalans.

Fig.  shows hook blade length and base width variables of the 72 Echinorhynchus
truttae specimens plotted against a standardized position (for definition, see morphological data analysis section of material and methods). Sexual dimorphism is not readily apparent in these two plots. Proboscis profiles were generated with a moving average segment of 11; the minimum sized moving average segment that can be applied to this dataset. Principal component analysis of these proboscis profiles revealed subtle sexual dimorphism, with some separation of the females from males in principal component one (PC1), which describes 49% of the variation in the dataset (Fig. ). A Welch two sample t-test found a significant difference (p=0.005) between females and males in the scores for PC1. Base width variables show higher loadings than blade length variables for PC1 (Fig. ), suggesting that female Echinorhynchus
truttae tend to have 'stouter' hooks than males. In view of this strong evidence of sexual dimorphism in proboscis profiles, the two sexes are considered separately in the inter-specific comparisons that follow.

Proboscis profiles for 56 female acanthocephalans (5 of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis, 2 of Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis', 3 of Echinorhynchus
leidyi and 46 of Echinorhynchus
truttae) were generated using a moving average segment of 10; the minimum sized moving average segment applicable. This dataset of female hook morphometrics (Suppl. material ) includes data from one of the paratypes of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis from the Bothnian Bay. Fig.  shows positional variation in raw hook morphometrics of female worms; whilst some interspecific variation is apparent, the taxa are indistinguishable. A principal component analysis of the proboscis profiles was performed and a scatterplot of the scores for the first two principal components (Fig. ) shows a clear separation of Echinorhynchus
truttae from the other taxa. The loadings plot for the first two principal components (Fig. ) shows that blade length and base width measurements from hooks in the 80.5–95.5% region of the proboscis are driving the separation of Echinorhynchus
truttae from the other taxa along PC1 (this first principal component accounts for 64% of the variance in the dataset). Echinorhynchus
bothniensis, Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' and Echinorhynchus
leidyi are not separated from each other in the scores plot for PC1 and PC2. Hierarchical clustering was used to objectively partition the proboscis profiles into morphotypes; a Euclidean distance matrix was calculated from the scores for PC1 and PC2 and a dendrogram was computed using the complete agglomeration method as implemented in the R function hclust (Fig. ). The dendrogram shows the presence of two distinct groups: one containing all profiles of Echinorhynchus
truttae and the other comprising the profiles of the other taxa. The proboscis profile of one specimen of Echinorhynchus
leidyi clustered with the Echinorhynchus
truttae profiles. The Echinorhynchus
truttae cluster comprises two subclusters which are not related to geographical location.

None of the male specimens of Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' had fully everted proboscides and so hook morphometric data could not be collected from them. Therefore, the analysis of interspecific variation in proboscis profiles for male worms was limited to three species: Echinorhynchus
bothniensis (n=5), Echinorhynchus
leidyi (n=10) and Echinorhynchus
truttae (n=26) (data available as Suppl. material ). Plots of hook morphometrics against standardized position (Fig. ) show some separation of Echinorhynchus
truttae from the other taxa; this is most apparent in blade length measurements towards the base of the proboscis (Fig. ). Proboscis profiles were generated with a moving average segment of 11, the minimum applicable to the dataset, and then further investigated using principal components analysis. A scores plot for PC1 and PC2 (Fig. ) showed a clear separation of Echinorhynchus
truttae from the other two taxa, and a partial separation of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis from Echinorhynchus
leidyi. As was found for the female proboscis profiles, blade length and base width measurements from hooks at the base of the proboscis (80–95% region) are driving the separation of Echinorhynchus
truttae from the other taxa (Fig. ). Hierarchical clustering partioned the male proboscis profiles into three groups corresponding to the three taxa (Fig. ). However, the proboscis profiles for one of the 10 speciemens of Echinorhynchus
leidyi was placed in the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis cluster. As in the dendrogram for female acanthocephalans, the Echinorhynchus
truttae branch bifurcates into two subclusters which are not related to sampling locality.

Ecological observations
The frequency distribution of Echinorhynchus
truttae in its definitive host Salmo
trutta was recorded for two localities: Loch Walton Burn and Loch Coulter Burn (summary statistics in Table ; raw data available in Suppl. materials , ). Prevalence of infection was low in both host populations, as were the mean and maximum intensity of infection. Nevertheless, the acanthocephalans were successfully mating, as evident from the presence of gravid females in fish from both localities. The aggregation index was greater than unity in both localities, indicating that the acanthocephalans were overdispersed in their host populations. To further investigate the frequency distribution of the parasite in its host populations, two theoretical distributions were fitted to each dataset (Fig. ); the Poisson distribution is a good model for a random distribution, while the negative binomial describes overdispersion. A chi-squared test showed that a fitted negative binomial distribution was not significantly different from the observed distribution at both localities (Loch Walton, chi-squared statistic 2.03, p-value 0.155; Loch Coulter, chi-squared statistic 1.81, p-value 0.178). Conversely, the Poisson distribution was a poor fit to the observed data (Loch Walton, chi-squared statistic 13.2, p-value 0.00135; Loch Coulter, chi-squared statistic 6.13, p-value 0.0467).

Gammarus
pulex, the intermediate host of Echinorhynchus
truttae, was abundant in both streams. One hundred specimens of this amphipod from Loch Walton Burn were examined by dissection, and while no larval Echinorhynchus
truttae were found, four cystacanths of Polymorphus
minutus (Goeze, 1782) (Polymorphida: Polymorphidae) were encountered.

Discussion
Intraspecific morphological variation
This study provides the first detailed account of morphometric and meristic variation in adult Echinorhynchus
truttae, albeit for populations within a small part of its known geographical range. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Echinorhynchus
truttae samples are assumed to comprise a single biological species. However, given the ubiquity of cryptic speciation in the Acanthocephala (, , , ), this assumption might be unwarranted. The Echinorhynchus
truttae material examined in the present study conforms well to other published descriptions (, , ) but displays considerably greater morphological variability. The only notable difference between the descriptions provided by different authors concerns the size of the eggs. The wide range of egg dimensions recorded in the present study (120–173 × 22–34 µm) ecompasses the measurements reported by  (138 × 24 µm), but not the range of dimensions reported by  (100–110 × 23–24 µm) and  (100–110 × 24 µm). Discrepancies in egg dimensions between different studies are most likely the result of different fixatives and clearing agents being used to prepare the material for light microscopy, but may also be due to differences in the state of maturity of the acanthors. Shrinkage of eggs following fixation, staining and mounting has been reported by many authors (e.g., , , ).

Echinorhynchus
truttae exhibited sexual dimorphism in all morphometric variables common to both genders. Within each gender, a proportion of the variance in some morphometric variables was explained by body length. Seven morphometric variables (body width, proboscis length, proboscis receptacle length, lemniscus length and width, vagina width and vaginal sphincter width) were found to be positively correlated with body length in female worms, whilst just four (length of reproductive system, lemniscus length, length of both anterior and posterior testis) showed this relationship in males. However, the length range and sample size of male worms was small relative to that of females and this would have made it more difficult to find evidence of any correlation. A positive correlation with body length can be demonstrated for the size of most anatomical structures in palaecanthocephalans (e.g., ).  found that both female and male Echinorhynchus
truttae increase in length with time spent in the intestine of their definitive host, Salmo
trutta, and that proboscis length increases with body size. Furthermore, body length and time spent in the definitive host intestine were also positively correlated with sexual maturation in female worms.

Proboscis profiler provided tentative evidence for the presence of two distinct morphotypes within Echinorhynchus
truttae (Figs , ). This variation was not related to geography, as both subgroups contained samples from both the River Carron catchment, central Scotland and Drummore, southwest Scotland. A molecular genetic analysis would be required to test the hypothesis that these two apparent morphotypes represent sibling species.

Small sample sizes prohibited a statistical analysis of intraspecific morphological variation in the other taxa studied. However, comparison of the mean values and ranges of most morphometric variables (Tables , ) suggest that these taxa also display sexual dimorphism. The Bothnian Bay and Lake Keitele populations of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis are thought to have been reproductively isolated for at least 6000 years (); however, this study did not find any obvious morphological divergence between them.

Discrimination of species using morphological characters
The genetic differentiation of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' into distinct biological species, as evidenced from allozyme electrophoresis (), was not accompanied by obvious divergence in conventional morphological characters. Furthermore, proboscis profiler failed to discriminate these species on the basis of female hook morphometrics. Proboscis profiler could not be used to compare the males of these species, as hook data were not available for male Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis'. Proboscis profiler has been used to successfully discriminate two species of the Echinorhynchus
gadi species group identified by allozyme electrophoresis (). However, Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' probably diverged more recently than the sibling species of the Echinorhynchus
gadi group () and therefore have had less time to undergo adaptive morphological change. Moreover, if Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' occur in allopatry, but utlise similar intermediate and definitive hosts, there may be little or no selection pressure to drive morphological divergence. In contrast, the sibling species of Echinorhynchus
gadi separable by Proboscis profiler occur in sympatry and often in the same host individual. In this case, adaptation to different regions of the definitive host intestine to avoid competition and/or hybridization may have resulted in anatomical changes to the hooks of the proboscis ().

The anatomically similar Echinorhynchus
leidyi from the Nearctic has not been investigated using molecular markers and so its systematic homogeneity and relationship to Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' may only be speculated. Echinorhynchus
leidyi could not be discriminated from Echinorhynchus
bothniensis or Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis' using any conventional morphological character or the proboscis profiles of female worms. When applied to male worms, proboscis profiler was quite successful in separating four specimens of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis from ten specimens of Echinorhynchus
leidyi, however a fifth specimen of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis was assigned to the Echinorhynchus
leidyi cluster (Fig. ). Nevertheless, this observation should be interpreted with caution as it is based on a small sample of acanthocephalans and may be an artifact of the different protocols used to prepare samples of the two taxa for light microscopy.

The inability of multivariate statistical analysis to reliably distinguish the Nearctic Echinorhynchus
leidyi from the Palaearctic Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis', on the basis of morphological characters, is further evidence of the phylogenetic affinity of these taxa. If these acanthocephalans have co-speciated with their mysid intermediate hosts, as hypothesised by , they will be members of a clade comprising at least four sibling species (), some of which may occur in sympatry and at least one may have a circumarctic distribution. An extensive sampling effort combined with tandem molecular and morphological analysis was needed to differentiate and characterize the species of the Mysis
relicta (sensu lato) group; a similar strategy will be required to investigate the diversity in their echinorhynchid parasites.

Echinorhynchus
truttae could not be discriminated from Echinorhynchus
leidyi and the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis species complex on the basis of any single conventional morphological character. However, Proboscis profiler successfully separated Echinorhynchus
truttae from Echinorhynchus
leidyi, Echinorhynchus
bothniensis and Echinorhynchus 'bothniensis'. The hook morphometric data available here as supplementary files (Suppl. materials , ) serve as a useful reference for Echinorhynchus
truttae, Echinorhynchus
leidyi and the Echinorhynchus
bothniensis species group, to which new samples of Echinorhynchus spp. from fresh and brackish waters can be compared using Proboscis profiler.

Distribution of acanthocephalans in their definitive host populations
The frequency distribution of macroparasites within their host populations almost invariably shows overdispersion or aggregation; most hosts harbour few or no parasites, and a few hosts harbour large numbers of parasites (, , , , , , , , , ). Overdispersion is described empirically by the negative binomial distribution (). In the case of natural infections of Acanthocephala, this distribution has previously been shown to provide an accurate description of the following species in their definitive host populations: Acanthocephalus
clavula (Dujardin, 1845) in Gasterosteus
aculeatus L. (see ) and Anguilla
anguilla (L.) (see ); Acanthocephalus
lucii (Müller, 1776) in Perca
fluviatilis (L.) (see ); and Echinorhynchus
canyonensis Huffman &amp; Kliever, 1977 in Maynea
californica Gilbert (see ). In this study the negative binomial provided a good model of the distribution of Echinorhynchus
truttae in two populations of its definitive host Salmo
trutta. However,  found that the negative binomial was a poor fit to the frequency distribution of Pomphorhynchus
laevis (Müller, 1776) in Leuciscus
leuciscus (L.), even though the parasite was not randomly distributed in its host population.

The negative binomial distribution has also been used to quantify aggregation of larval acanthocephalans in populations of their intermediate hosts.  found that it was a good fit to the observed frequency distribution of Pomphorhynchus
laevis in a population of Gammarus
pulex (L.). If there is parasite-induced host mortality, as in the case of natural infections of Gammarus
pulex by Polymorphus
minutus (Goeze, 1782), then a truncated negative binomial model is more appropriate ().

Overdispersion of parasites in their host populations may have various causes, including seasonality in the occurrence of infective stages, spatial aggregation of infective stages, and differences between hosts in behaviour, physiology and immune response to the parasites (e.g. , , ). Echinorhynchus
truttae is known to display a seasonal pattern of abundance in its intermediate host, Gammarus
pulex (see ). However, seasonality should only be a cause of overdispersion in data-sets comprising samples taken throughout the year; in this study the two Echinorhynchus
truttae data-sets each represented single samples.

Aggregation of cystacanths of Echinorhynchus
truttae in its amphipod intermediate host Gammarus
pulex, is a potential cause of the acanthocephalan's overdispersion in its definitive host Salmo
trutta. Since cystacanths of Polymorphus
minutus and Pomphorhynchus
laevis have been found to be aggregated in populations of Gammarus
pulex, then it is plausible that the same phenomenon occurs in Echinorhynchus
truttae. If the larvae of Echinorhynchus
truttae were aggregated in their intermediate host population, then, although their fish hosts may have encountered intermediate hosts at random, the worm burden of the intermediate hosts encountered would not be random. This would lead to a heterogenous distribution of acanthocephalans in the fish population.

It is important to note that overdispersion of acanthocephalans in their definitive hosts can occur in the absence of spatial aggregation of cystacanths.  found that Moniliformis
moniliformis (Bremser, 1811) Travassos, 1915 (as Moniliformis
dubius Meyer, 1932) had an aggregated distribution in groups of rats (Rattus
norvegicus (Berkenhout)) in which every rat had been fed the same number of cystacanths.  found that the prevalence and overdispersion of Echinorhynchus
bothniensis infections of Osmerus
eperlanus increased with host size. This observation suggests that overdispersion in this particular host-parasite system is linked to some aspect of the interaction between parasite and definitive host.

Experimental work is necessary to determine the causes of overdispersion of acanthocephalans in their host populations. Moniliformis
moniliformis in rats serves as a convenient laboratory model for studies on acanthocephalan dispersion in mammalian host populations (, ). Echinorhynchus
truttae in Salmo
trutta might represent a useful model for studies of acanthocephalan dispersion in fish populations, since this species has a life cycle which can be completed in the laboratory ().
