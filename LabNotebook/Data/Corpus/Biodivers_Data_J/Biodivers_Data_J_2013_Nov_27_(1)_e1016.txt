Introduction
Madagascar houses a rich and taxonomically diverse fauna of the scarab beetles of subfamily Orphninae. Thirty five species of four genera are known and all of them are endemic to the island (, , , ). Only three species (Triodontus
nitidulus (Guérin-Méneville, 1844), Pseudorphnus
coquerelii (Fairmaire, 1868), and Renorphnus
clementi (Petrovitz, 1971)) have a reasonably wide distribution and are known from a large number of specimens, which might indicate their adaptation to feeding on crops (documented for Triodontus
nitidulus larvae: . All other species are rare in collections and many are known from type specimens only. Distribution of taxa is biased towards indigenous forests of the central domain of the Eastern Region and many species ranges may now be limited to isolated patches of forests.

In 2000s, researchers from the California Academy of Sciences (San-Francisco, USA) undertook insect surveys on Madagascar which yielded a rich orphnine material including a few new species (, ). However, a part of this material, kept in vials with alcohol, was not available for study until recently. In this material, a few rare Madagascan orphnine species were identified. New locality records for these species are given in the present communication. The endophallus armature of Madecorphnus
niger Frolov, 2010, is described and illustrated.

Materials and methods
All examined material is housed in the collection of California Academy of Sciences (San-Francisco, USA).

Preparation of genitalia follows the common technique used in entomological research. The photograph was taken with a Leica MZ9.5 stereo microscope and a Leica DFC290 digital camera from specimen in glycerol. Partially focused serial images were combined in Helicon Focus software (Helicon Soft Ltd.) to produce completely focused image. The photograph was not altered except for levels and tone correction in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Inc.). The distribution map was generated with ArcGIS software. As the base map, a Madagascar vegetation map (CEPF Madagascar Vegetation Mapping Project of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Missouri Botanical Garden, and Conservation International’s Center for Applied Biodiversity Science; http://www.vegmad.org) was used. Co-ordinates of the localities were taken from the specimen labels.

Distribution
This species was known from 2 types from Perinet (Andasibe). The two additional localities reported here are situated 70 km NNW and 140 km NNE of the type locality, both within the humid forest biome (Fig. ).

Taxon discussion
Type specimens of Madecorphnus
niger were damaged (lacked endophalluses) and the species was described chiefly on the basis of the distinctive shape of the aedeagus. Examination of the newly available material showed that the endophallus armature is also quite distinctive. The armature consists of three similar, highly sclerotized, tooth-like sclerites (Fig. ). Other sclerites or fields of spinules are absent.

Distribution
This species was known from the only type specimen collected in Antanambe, on the eastern coast of Madagascar. The additional specimen (Fig. ) was collected some 100 km south (Fig. ), in littoral forest litter. This species may be a littoral forest specialist.
