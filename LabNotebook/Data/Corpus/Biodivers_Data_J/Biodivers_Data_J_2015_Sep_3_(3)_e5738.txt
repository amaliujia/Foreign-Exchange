The genus Aegialoalaimus de Man, 1907 includes 12 nominal species, of which three species are considered valid, two species were transferred to other genera and seven species have uncertain taxonomic status.

New information
New species, Aegialoalaimus
bratteni sp. n. was found in Skagerrak off the west coast of Sweden. It is particularly characterized by the 1.5-1.8 mm long body, short papilliform cephalic sensilla, excretory pore opening just posterior to nerve ring level, spicules that are straight in shape, supplements and gubernaculum absent, separating it from other valid species of the genus. It can be further differentiated from Aegialoalaimus
elegans in having longer body (1.5-1.8 mm in A.
bratteni sp. n. vs 0.8-1.3 mm in A.
elegans), shape and size of spicules (straight and 22-29 µm long in A.

Introduction
The genus Aegialoalaimus de Man, 1907 was originally described based on single species Aegialoalaimus
elegans de Man, 1907 from the North Sea (de Man 1907). Subsequently, eleven more species were described within this genus, but only three were considered valid in the most recent review of the genus by Tchesunov (1990). Aegialoalaimus
brevicaudatus Kreis, 1924 was transferred to the genus Paraterschellingia, and A.
amphibulbosus Gerlach, 1955 – to Setoplectus. Two species, A.
setosa Bouwman, 1981 and A.
leptosoma Gagarin, 2012, are described well enough to warrant status of valid species (Bouwman 1981, Gagarin 2012), while the status of remaining seven species remains questionable. In this paper a new species of Aegialoalaimus, A.
bratteni sp. n., is described from the bottom sediments collected in the Bratten area (Swedish economic zone of Skagerrak) off the west coast of Sweden.

Materials and methods
Bottom sediment samples were collected in several locations in the southern part of the Skagerrak designated as Bratten area. All samples were collected with the bottom dredge and further sieved in the lab before fixation. Nematodes were extracted from samples using a decanting and sieving method (smallest mesh sizes: 45 µm or 70 µm). Fresh water was used during sieving to induce osmotic shock in nematodes so they will detach from the substrate. Samples were immediately fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Formaldehyde-preserved specimens were transferred to pure glycerine using Seinhorst (1959) rapid method as modified by De Grisse (1969). Permanent nematode mounts on glass slides were prepared using the paraffin wax ring method. All curved structures were measured along the curved median line.

Abbreviations used in the text are as follows: L = overall body length; a = body length / greatest body diameter; b = body length / pharyngeal region length; c = body length / tail length; c' = tail length / cloacal body diameter; T = length of main gonad (excluding flexures) / body length (expressed in %).

Type specimens of Aegialoalaimus
cylindricauda Allgén, 1933 (SMNH Type-3559) and A.
paratenuicaudatus Allgén, 1959 (SMNH Type-8762) from the invertebrate collection of the Swedish Museum of Natural History (SMNH) were used in this study. Despite considerable search efforts, type material of the following species cannot be located in the collection of C. Allgén: A.
conicaudatus Allgén, 1959, A.
punctatus (Allgén, 1929), A.
sabulicola Allgén, 1933 and A.

Type status:
Holotype. Occurrence: catalogNumber: SMNH Type-3559; sex: female; Record Level: institutionID: Department of Zoology, Swedish Museum of Natural History; collectionID: invertebrate type collection

Description
The only type specimen is preserved but its internal structures are poorly visible.

Taxon discussion
The original description is based on single female specimen (Allgén 1933: 62-63, Fig. 35). In general morphology, this specimen resembles members of the family Microlaimidae (Fig. 2A): amphid circular in shape; stoma funnel-shaped with small dorsal tooth; pharynx is muscular along its entire length, cylindrical in its anterior part and with well developed basal bulb; female reproductive system didelphic, gonads outstretched. This species is considered species inquirenda et incerta sedis within the family Microlaimidae.

The only type specimen is poorly preserved, its anterior end is dried out.

Taxon discussion
The original description is based on single female specimen (Allgén 1959: 132, Fig. 134). In general morphology, this specimen resembles members of the family Comesomatidae (Fig. 2B): amphid is multispiral; pharynx is muscular along its entire length, cylindrical in its anterior part and with weak basal swelling; female reproductive system didelphic, gonads outstretched. This species is considered species inquirenda et incerta sedis within the family Comesomatidae.

Discussion
Aegialoalaimus
conicaudatus Allgén, 1959
Type material of this species could not be located in the collection of C. Allgén. Description and illustrations of this species do not provide sufficient information to be able to assign this species to any nematode genus or family (Allgén 1959: 132, Fig. 135a-b). As drawn, pharynx appears to be muscularized along its entire length, cylindrical in its anterior part, with basal bulb; it can match a number of nematode families, but is dissimilar to the pharynx of Aegialoalaimus. This species is considered species inquirenda et incerta sedis within Nematoda.

Aegialoalaimus
elegans sensu Bussau, 1993
Population of Aegialoalaimus
elegans described by Bussau (1993) differs from the typical A.
elegans in having shorter body (0.4-0.6 mm in Bussau specimens vs 0.8-1.3 in A.
elegans), shorter spicules (15 µm in Bussau male vs 34 µm in A.
elegans), presence of a small notch on the ventral side of spicules (vs absent in A.
elegans). It is possible that specimens found and described by Bussau (1993) belong to a different, new species of Aegialoalaimus, but without examining actual specimens I refrain from naming it.

Aegialoalaimus
punctatus (Allgén, 1929)

Type material of this species could not be located in the collection of C. Allgén. Aegialoalaimus
punctatus (Allgén, 1929) was originally described as Kreisia
punctata Allgén, 1929. Description and illustrations of this species do not provide sufficient information to be able to assign this species to any nematode genus or family (Allgén 1929: 461, Fig. 21). As drawn, pharynx appears to be muscularized along its entire length, cylindrical in its anterior part, with basal bulb; it can match a number of nematode families, but is dissimilar to the pharynx of Aegialoalaimus. There are two separate circles of setae and the amphid is multispiral – two more characters not found in the genus Aegialoalaimus. This species is considered species inquirenda et incerta sedis within Nematoda.


Aegialoalaimus
sabulicola Allgén, 1933
Type material of this species could not be located in the collection of C. Allgén. Description and illustrations of this species do not provide sufficient information to be able to assign this species to any nematode genus or family (Allgén 1933: 64-65, Fig. 37). As drawn, tail appears to be conoid with well developed spinneret and is dissimilar to tail shape typical for valid species of the genus Aegialoalaimus. This species is considered species inquirenda et incerta sedis within Nematoda.

Aegialoalaimus
tenuicaudatus Allgén, 1932
Type material of this species could not be located in the collection of C. Allgén. Description and illustrations of this species do not provide sufficient information to be able to assign this species to any nematode genus or family (Allgén 1932: 414-415, Fig. 5). As drawn, pharynx appears to be muscularized along its entire length, cylindrical in its anterior part, with basal bulb; it can match a number of nematode families, but is dissimilar to pharynx of Aegialoalaimus. Similarly, population described as A.
tenuicaudatus by Allgén (Allgén 1933: 63-64, Fig. 36) does not match the diagnosis of Aegialoalaimus. On the other hand, both show superficial resemblance to the family Microlaimidae in the shape of the amphid, pharynx and tail. Subsequent redescription of A.
tenuicaudatus by Allgén (1935) was positively identified as Molgolaimus
turgifrons Lorenzen, 1972 by Jensen (1978a). Therefore, we consider this species to belong to the family Microlaimidae.

Aegialoalaimus
tenuis Kreis, 1928

Aegialoalaimus
tenuis Kreis, 1928 most probably should be placed in the family Microlaimidae based on the following characters: pharynx cylindrical in its anterior part, with basal bulb, muscularized along its entire length; reproductive system didelphic, gonads outstretched (Kreis 1928).
