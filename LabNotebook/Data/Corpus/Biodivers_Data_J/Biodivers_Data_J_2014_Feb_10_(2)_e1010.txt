Introduction
Research on the Diptera of the Hawaiian Islands dates to the last half of the 19th century and was first summarized in the Fauna Hawaiiensis (1899-1910) series (). Zimmerman's multivolume Insects of Hawaii series (1948-2003) has also added greatly to our knowledge of the endemic and introduced insect species present in Hawaii (). The Proceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society and the Records of the B. P. Bishop Museum are two other venues that were used by Hawaiian entomologists to publish shorter works or updates on new species, new invaders or new island records. It was from these works that the Bishop Museum created a comprehensive checklist of the Terrestrial Arthropods of the Hawaiian Islands (). My lab has been conducting collections and surveys in Hawaii as part of various projects for over 15 years. As a result, we have many new species and new island records and have generated a number of new identification tools for several fly families. The goal of this multipart series is to publish these data in an accessible format to facilitate further research on Hawaiian Diptera. Future papers will focus on new island records and identification tools for Dicranomyia, a description of a new species of Procancae with a revised key to the genus, and new island records for Scatella.

Asteiidae are a small family of acalyptrate flies, containing approximately 130 species worldwide. There are 11 genera in the family but over half of the described species belong to a single genus, Asteia (, , ). The ecological associations of this group are unclear, although members of this family have been reared from a variety of substrates, including fungi, frass, bleeding trees and dried stems ().

The most recent revision of the Hawaiian Asteiidae (), lists three genera, Asteia, Bryania, and Loewimyia, as well as a comprehensive key to Hawaiian members of this family. Bryania and Loewimyia each contain a single species from Hawaii and are uncommon in collections.  considered Bryania
bipunctata, the only species described in this genus, an endemic species from the Northwest Hawaiian Islands. The relationship of Bryania to the other Hawaiian asteiids remains unclear. They described Loewimyia
orbiculata as a new species from Oahu but did not comment on whether or not they considered it to be endemic (). The genus Loewimyia is known only from one other species found only in North America so it may be a migrant. Members of the genus Asteia are the largest and most commonly collected asteiids, comprising nine of the eleven Hawaiian asteiid species (Table ).

Many Hawaiian radiations are characterized by a high degree of single island endemism. For example, &gt;95% of the ~300 species Hawaiian Campsicnemus (Diptera: Dolichopodidae) are single island endemics () and approximately 85% of the 1000 Hawaiian Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) are also found on just one island (, ). In contrast, smaller groups like the genus Dicranomyia (Diptera: Limoniidae) have less than 30% of species endemic to a single island (, ). According to the latest revision of the Hawaiian Asteia (), seven of the nine described species (78%) are single island endemics. However, recent collections demonstrate that only three of the nine (33%) known species are endemic to a single island (Table ).

Materials and methods
Literature Review
We have reviewed the literature for the Hawaiian Asteia and have attempted to include infomation on both the taxonomic history of the species and all occurrences of the endemic taxa in the literature, including the original descriptions, subsequent revisions, additional descriptive notes, range expansions and new island records and catalogs. The original authors of most of the species covered here designated holotypes, allotypes and paratypes in the original descriptions. We list the type, paratypes and other material examined. We have attempted to include as much collection data from the original publications as possible. In some cases label data were elaborated via examination of material deposited in the B. P. Bishop Museum or the University of Hawaii Entomological Collection.

Collection Methods
All material was obtained from general sweeping of vegetation, seeps and streams. Samples were preserved in 95% ethanol (ETOH) and transported to UC Berkeley for identification. Key and descriptions by  were used to identify the Hawaiian Asteia. Historical specimens examined in this study are deposited in the University of Hawaii Entomology Collection (UHEC) or the B. P. Bishop Museum (BPBM). All material collected by the authors was preserved in 95% ETOH and deposited in the University of Californiaâ€™s Essig Museum of Entomology (UCB).

Discussion
These revised numbers of single island endemics signifanctly change how our interpretations of diversification may be occurring, particularly in smaller, more recent radiations like Asteia. The prevailing dogma is that a population of one species colonizes a neighbor island, becomes reproductively isolated and, over time, diverges in allopatry, forming a distinct sister species. There are many examples of such divergence in the Hawaian Drosophila (e.g., ). Taxa endemic to Maui Nui (the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawae) often display a slightly different pattern due to the recent historical connections present between these islands in periods of low sea stands (). If a species is present on more than one island, it is often the case that these islands are in the Maui Nui group. This is the case with two of the seven new island records we report in this paper. There is little evidence concerning the dispersal abilities of these taxa or the potential mechanism for inter-island transport. There are no flightless or brachypterous Asteia so they may be able to fly from island to island. They may also be blown from one island to another, as has been suggested for several other groups of Hawaiian Diptera (, , ). Additional work is clearly needed to better understand dispersal ability in various groups of Hawaiian arthropods.

Multiple lineages of broadly overlapping species suggest another process may be acting in groups such as Dicranomyia (, ) and Asteia. In these groups divergence may take place on smaller geographic scales (e.g., within an island) or be driven by adaptation to different ecological niches. Two species of Hawaiian Asteia have been reared from a number of native Hawaiian tree species (Table ), suggesting an ecological role for divergence within this group. While some taxa (e.g., Asteia
nudiseta on Suttonia = Myrsine) have label data that indicate some association with a specific plant, we did not include them in Table  unless the author stated they were reared.

O'Grady and Magnacca collected the new material for this paper and transcribed the label data and literature records from older material. O'Grady determined the material present in the UC Berkeley collection. O'Grady and Magnacca wrote the paper.

Distribution of Asteia species in Hawaii. Status indicates whether the species are endemic (E), introduced (I) or adventive (A). Islands sampled are: Kauai (K), Oahu (O), Molokai (Mo), Lanai (L), Maui (Ma), and Hawaii (H). Presence of a species on a given island is designated by an X. An asterisk denotes a new island record for the species.
