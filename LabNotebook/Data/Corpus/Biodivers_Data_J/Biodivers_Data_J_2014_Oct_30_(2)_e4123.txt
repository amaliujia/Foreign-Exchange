Introduction
Amphibians are ectotherms, and all aspects of their life history are strongly influenced by the external environment, including weather and climate. Amphibians are currently the most threatened taxonomic group worldwide (, ). The major threats acting on amphibian populations are habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, pollution, global change or disease exposure (, , , ). Habitat fragmentation is actually recognized as the major treat of amphibian decline (, ) by its strong impact on population functioning, in particular in amphibians. Indeed, habitat fragmentation can decrease the size of habitat patches, and also the distances between habitat patches (, , ). Consequently, this loss of connectivity should negatively affect population functioning, by limiting dispersal events between patches and by increasing inbreeding risk ().

The impact of global warming on amphibian populations has been reported several times (, , , , , , ). For example, the breeding phenology of anurans adapted to breeding in early spring might be shifted to even earlier breeding in recent years in response to warmer spring temperatures (, , ). These responses may not be universal among amphibians and remain a matter of debate (, , ). It is undoubted that rising temperatures, changes in precipitation and UV-radiation are considered stressful and might be associated with disease outbreaks in amphibian populations (, , ). UV-B may, however, also enhance tadpole growth in some species (), but with not yet anticipated effects on survival of metamorphs and population dynamics.

Our database on life history traits of 86 European Amphibian species is an important prerequisite for understanding change in amphibian life history, community composition and migration behavior. Such data is important to inform the Essential Biodiversity Variables (), develop new indicators and ultimately inform the decision-making process to improve amphibian conservation.

General description
Purpose
Our database summarizes life history traits, including morphology, reproductive strategies, movement abilities, habitat preferences, distribution and IUCN status for all European amphibian species (N=86), all in all 44 traits subdivided into 253 modalities. Our database comprises information from 304 scientific publications assembled by searching Web of Science®, Amphibiaweb () and herpetological books. The IUCN status, from 1 (least concern) to 6 (extinct in the wild), and their population trends (-1: decreasing, 0: stable or +1: increasing) were extracted from the IUCN red list website (). In total, we were able to compile data for 50 Anurans and 36 Urodela (Fig. ). When several values were available for a continuous trait, we averaged them across studies (i.e. between populations). When they are available, data for males, females, juveniles (larvae) and tadpoles were reported. Summary of mean data, range and missing values are given in Table .

Because habitat fragmentation is currently the most threat affecting amphibian populations, movement specific data could help for conservation plans. By this way, we first selected traits related to movement abilities. Then, the costs associated with movements, and particularly with dispersal, might constrain the allocation of resources among all components of an individual’s life, and could lead to relationships between movement abilities and several other traits. Indeed, and compared to relationships found between movement and life history traits in other groups (in mammals and birds: , , ), we then reported traits that could be related to movement abilities, always in order to help for amphibian management.

Geographic coverage
Description
Our database included all amphibian species present in Europe (, ). Four invasive species were included in the database (Anaxyrus
americanus, Lithobates
catesbeianus, Lithobates
sylvaticus and Xenopus
laevis). A particularity is that Bufotes
viridis has been recently split in several species. To avoid biased data, we considered all populations to represent identical entities and therefore argued that they shared identical traits. By this way, we reported only traits referring to Bufotes
viridis (formerly Bufo
viridis) and we did not take into account traits related to new splited species.

Traits coverage

Morphological traits

We reported 14 morphological traits (32 modalities) for each European amphibian species: body lengths, body mass, limb lengths and details about webbing and fingers (Table ). These traits were supposed to be relevant for amphibian conservation.


Life history traits

We collected 17 life history traits (65 modalities), when available, for European amphibians (Table ). Life history traits vary considerably between species, and between Anura and Urodela in particular. The database includes data about activity, survival rates, sexual maturity, mating systems, characteristics of eggs and clutch position, parental care, foot diet, defense system, communication and territoriality.


Movement

We reported 7 traits related to movement, by separating when possible migration (N subcategories) and dispersal events (21 modalities; Table ). In contrast to migration, dispersal is defined as individual movement that induces gene flow (). Amphibians regularly migrate between terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and some individuals also engage in dispersal, leaving their population of birth (or previous reproduction) to join another suitable habitat in the landscape. We used the maximum distance (and not the modal distance) recorded by species because long-distance dispersal movements have considerably higher impact on species spread, species persistence, and metapopulation functioning (). All dispersal and migration values were estimated using mark-release-recapture or individual tracking. In general, amphibians are considered as low dispersal species (, ), but we detected several species for which dispersal and/or migration distances were &gt; 10 km (Fig. ).


Habitat preferences and distribution

We collected habitat preferences and 2 traits related to spatial distribution (113 modalities; Table ). Amphibians are often considered as specialized to certain habitat types, which make them particularly sensitive to landscape changes. Nevertheless, habitat preferences, and particularly terrestrial habitats of amphibian species request much clarification, especially given the recent changes induced by habitat fragmentation. We categorized habitats as follows (): forest, savanna, shrubland, grassland, wetlands, rocky areas, caves and subterranean habitats (non-aquatic), deserts, artificial/terrestrial habitats, and other. We chose to use the following IUCN habitats because in our opinion it is the most conservative assumptions about species delimitations and also because these are the entities currently recognized by international conservation authorities and that is the actual aim of the database. Moreover, for this inter-specific database we avoided selecting too specific habitats, and chose relatively broad habitat categories which included all habitats in which species live. We also noted biogeographical regions () where species were present, and the proportion of their distribution map on each continent.


Threats

We collected information on three categories (22 modalities; Table ) related to threats of amphibian species: The IUCN status (6 subcategories), population trend (4 subcategories), and major threats (12 subcategories).

Conclusion


Our database is the first comprehensive trait database in European amphibians. After an extensive research effort, our database highlighted the lack of data about amphibian traits and more generally, on amphibian’s biology. Improve our knowledge on amphibians should certainly help for their management, which might strongly enhance their conservation plans. Morphological traits, which are easy to collect, are still unavailable for many species. Data about movement abilities (both dispersal and migration) were the least informed data of all database. In particular, we showed that movement traits, which are difficult to collect, were unknown for a majority of threatened species. This database could be an essential support for management and conservation plans, and should be more efficient when all data will be available.

Definition of the 14 morphological traits and their modalities in the European amphibian database. For all traits recorded, DD (data deficient) means that no data were reported. When several values were available for a trait, we averaged them across studies (i.e. between populations).


Sexual dimorphism
	Difference in ornamentation (coloration) or in size (length of tail, size of head or body size) between sexes. In amphibians, females are generally bigger than males.
