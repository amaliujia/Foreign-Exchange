Introduction
Faunistic research on bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) in Tyrol enjoys a long tradition. Its foundations were laid by the great works of Dalla Torre (e.g. , , , , ) and  that are related to the former County of Tyrol. Numerous complementary studies followed by a large number of authors concerning different parts of the region, for example the Ötztal Alps (), Lower Inn Valley (), Tiroler Mittelland (), Upper Inn Valley (), tyrolean Lech area () and Silvretta Alps together with Kleinwalsertal in Vorarlberg ().  assembled a species list for South Tyrol which has been updated several times (, , ). Furthermore,  provided an excellent treatise on the bees of the Schlern region. Overviews for different taxonomic groups of bees have been conducted by  regarding Andrena in Northern Tyrol and records of Halictidae from Northern Tyrol were prepared by .  worked on the Megachilinae in North and South Tyrol and  evaluated the bumblebee fauna of eastern Tyrol. Additional faunistic data was assembled within the framework of the “GEO-Tage der Artenvielfalt” in Tyrol in 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2011. Aside from the data in , records for the Zillertal Alps are very rare, and for the Zemmgrund area only a list of bumblebee species for a small transect study () could be found in the literature. The aim of this study is to help close this knowledge gap and contribute the first extensive faunistic data set concerning the high alpine bee fauna of the Zillertal Alps.

Materials and methods
Collections were conducted near the Berliner Hütte in three periods: July 4-10, 2012, July 3-9, 2013 and August 6-10, 2013. The focus within the area was on bees around and above the Berliner Hütte which is located on 2042 m above sea level. All sighted wild bees were collected manually and were transfered into an ethyl acetate killing jar. The majority of specimens were collected between an altitudinal range of 1850 m to 2400 m a.s.l. Four specimens were collected at lower altitudes as accidental findings during ascent and descent. GPS coordinates and altitudes were logged. The habitat of each collection site was categorized. Determinations were conducted using the identification keys of Amiet (, , , , , ), Dathe (, ), Ebmer (, , ), , ,  and Scheuchl (, ). Critical specimens were sent to experts for examination: the author is indebted to Fritz Gusenleitner for helping with the specimens belonging to the genus Andrena and Maximilian Schwarz for specimens of Nomada. The suprageneric classification follows . All specimens are kept in the collection of the author. If the specimens were collected on flowers, the respective plant species was recorded. The plant species were determined using  and . A list of the recorded plant species in the supplementary material (Suppl. material ) provides further informations about the bee species visiting the respective flowers.

One collected specimen belongs to a cryptic bumblebee species group, the so-called Bombus
lucorum complex. The status of three distinct species within the complex is widely accepted today (, , , , , ). In contrast, there is heavy doubt about the species identification based on morphology and there are implications that the species might be morphologically indistinguishable (, , ). Therefore, a partial sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene from the specimen was ascertained to ensure the morphological determination. The specimen was stored in pure ethanol and a single crushed midleg was used for the analysis. DNA was extracted using a Proteinase K digestion prior to a phenol-chloroform protocol (). The so-called “Folmer region” was amplified with Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using the primers LCO1490 and HC02198 (). The remaining PCR components were provided using the DreamTaq™ PCR Mastermix (2x) (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and the amplification profile was conducted following the manufacturer´s protocol. The product was purified using the GeneJET™ PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and sequencing was carried out by the VBC-Biotech Service GmbH (Vienna, Austria). The obtained sequence was checked manually using BioEdit 7.2.5 (). A BLAST search (), as implemented in GenBank, was conducted to estimate the query cover and identity to other sequences deposited in the databank.

The climate map of the study area (Fig. ) is based on the recently updated Austrian digital climate atlas from 1971-2000 (). Given the importance of dependable data concerning the altitudinal climate changes, the high resolution Austrian climate maps for 1971-2000 consider altitudinal changes by a digital elevation model. The GIS grids were kindly provided by Alexander Orlik from the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG) and handled with QGIS 2.2 ().

The microscope images were created using a SMZ25 stereomicroscope and a DS-Ri1 U3 microscope camera (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Study area
The Zemmgrund is a valley located in the Zillertal Alps in Tyrol (Fig. ) and is part of the Nature Park Zillertal Alps. It is located close to the main ridge of the Alps in northern direction and the southern boundary of the Upper Zemmgrund is the present-day border to Italy. Characteristic feature of the area are three glaciers, which are rapidly retreating at present (): the Waxeggkees, Hornkees and the Schwarzensteinkees. The glaciers greatly influenced the geomorphology of the area and their moraines and remaining waters caused mosaics of diverse small-scaled habitats (Fig. ). The predominant habitats of the area are alpine meadows and alpine pastures, especially above the treeline (Fig. ). Other habitats are Swiss pine forests (Pinus
cembra L.), aggregations of mountain pines (Pinus
mugo Turra), tall forb meadows, dwarf shrub communities and wet meadows (Fig. ). Great comprehensive information of the area, concerning the history, anthropogenic usage, climate and geology are available in . In addition, this compendium contains an extensive study about the flora of the area by , a very useful source for melittologists!

Analysis
In total, 61 specimens were collected, representing 24 species from 8 genera. The list of bumblebee species provided in  can be complemented with 4 species. The note about Bombus
lucorum from this source is not evaluated due to the current unreliability of morphological identification of the species. Combining these records, 30 bee species have been recorded for the area. Of these, 15 are representatives of the genus Bombus.

Discussion
With increasing altitude, the climatic conditions in alpine environments become more extreme (). Especially the decreasing temperature (Fig. ) and increasing insolation are of importance for terrestrial arthropods above the timberline (). This also applies for bees: due to the short and cool summers in alpine regions in the European Alps,  conclude a phenological window of solely three months for bumblebees to complete their life cycle. With respect to the nearly completed snowmelt in the study area by mid of June, it can be safely assumed that the three investigation periods were extensive enough to collect the majority of bee species that may occur in the area. Nonetheless, the species list above cannot be assumed to be complete with certainty. Therefore the investigation periods were not evenly distributed throughout the season since no collections have been conducted in September. Also the study area is almost completely restricted to the Upper Zemmgrund and species which potentially occur below 1900 m altitude are absent from the species list. This becomes particularly apparent when comparing the records with the species list of . This species list is based on collections from July 17-19, 2009 by four persons on eight collection sites approx. 13 to 17 km from the Zemmgrund Area as the crow flies. Therefore it is comparable by place, time and collection effort but differs in the altitudinal range: the collections were conducted between 1760 m and approx. 950 m a.s.l. Only seven of 47 species collected by  can be found in both lists, namely the widely distributed bumblebees Bombus
hortorum, Bombus
monticola, Bombus
pratorum, Bombus
pyrenaeus and the widespread Lasioglossum
albipes, Lasioglossum
fratellum and Lasioglossum
morio. Therefore a great number of additional species can be expected at lower altitudes of the Zemmgrund area. Further the comparison of the lists indicates a decreasing species diversity along the rising altitudinal gradient. This is in line with the described species decrease of terrestrial arthropods at the timberline (). However, the species composition in the Upper Zemmgrund clearly reflects the high altitudes of the study area, since the majority of species have at least a montane distribution. Several records belong to explicit high-mountain species, such as Hylaeus
nivalis (, ), Andrena
rogenhoferi (, ), Panurginus
montanus (), Lasioglossum
alpigenum (), Dufourea
alpina () and the bumblebee species Bombus
mendax, Bombus
monticola and Bombus
wurflenii ().

Some species determinations must be discussed: Since females from Panurginus
montanus cannot be separated from females of the closely related Panurginus
sericatus Warncke, 1972 with the key of , the collected females are marked with “cf”. The species status of Panurginus
sericatus has been doubted (), but is valid after . However, since the males can easily be assigned by the shape of the gonostylus and both sexes were observed in the same area, it seems likely that the females belong to Panurginus
montanus.

Another species with difficult determination is Bombus
cryptarum. An identification based on the characteristic color patterns of queens was shown to be unreliable (), and an examination on the reliability of traits described in the common keys is urgently needed since several characters overlap. In contrast, sequence analyses of the COI gene represents a confident method for identification (e.g. , , , , ). A BLAST search of the obtained 609 bp long sequence from the collected specimen (Suppl. material , GenBank acc. no. KJ787691) revealed an identity of 99% with a query cover of 100% to a Bombus
cryptarum voucher (GenBank acc. no. JQ843372.1) and the next 40 hits by total score were assigned to Bombus
cryptarum. Therefore it can safely be assumed that the specimen belongs to Bombus
cryptarum. The specimen shows the ‘S’-shape of black hairs in the first collar (Fig. ), which has been considered a characteristic trait for queens in the literature (, , , ). After Rasmont (pers. comm.), specimens showing the “S” belong to the subspecies Bombus
cryptarum
cryptarum. However, since  could show that this trait seems to be unreliable, further discussion about species identification of the cryptic species of the Bombus
lucorum complex based on color patterns cannot be conducted until more safely determined specimens are accessible.

As with many species of the genus, Nomada
panzeri shows a great variation in color and size (). This also applies to the two collected specimens from this study which vary considerably (Fig. ). The specimens were determined and labeled by the European expert for this group, Maximilian Schwarz, as “Nomada
glabella auct.” (Nomada
glabella Thomson, 1870) which is a junior synonym to Nomada
panzeri ().  disagrees with the synonymy and argues with the clear distinguishability described in . Further he proposes differences in distributional patterns between Nomada
panzer and Nomada
glabella and solely mentions Andrena
lapponica and Andrena
fucata as host species of Nomada
glabella. In contrast, the majority of authors agree with the synonymy (e.g. , , , , , ). However, it can safely be assumed that the host species of Nomada
panzer in the study area is Andrena
lapponica.
