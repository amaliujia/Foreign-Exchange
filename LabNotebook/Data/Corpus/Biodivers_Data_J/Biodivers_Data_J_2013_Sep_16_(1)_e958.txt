Description
On 20 April 2013, while looking for insects in swards of long grass on the Tamaki Campus of the University of Auckland, I noticed two specimens of an unusual looking encyrtid. I collected one of the two specimens (see Figs , ), and identified it as Cheiloneurus
flaccus, using the redescription by . Cheiloneurus
flaccus is a distinctive species, quite different to the two congeneric species already known from N.Z. The antenna, in particular, is distinctive, with the first segment of the funicle much longer than the pedicel (see Fig. ). The species is known to be a parasitoid of dryinids. The site where I found Cheiloneurus
flaccus also abounds with dryinids belonging to two species of Gonatopus. Two other species of dryinid (Bocchus
thorpei, and Dryinius
koebelei) also occur on the campus. I recommend that Cheiloneurus
flaccus be added to the New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR) as exotic, present in the wild.
