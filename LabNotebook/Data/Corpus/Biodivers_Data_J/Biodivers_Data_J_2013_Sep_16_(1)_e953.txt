Introduction
Casuarinicola
australis Taylor, 2010 was described from Australia, where it is the most common and widespread member of its genus, being widely distributed in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Like its congeners, it is restricted to host trees of the genus Casuarina. Casuarinicola
australis occurs on all Australian species of Casuarina, including Casuarina
cunninghamiana and Casuarina
glauca. Both these species of Casuarina are exotic and present in the wild in New Zealand, according to the New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR), as well as present in cultivation. Casuarinicola has not been reported (by name) previously from N.Z.

Description
On 6 Jan 2013, I examined some Casuarina
glauca trees growing in the vicinity of Ports of Auckland at Mechanics Bay. A few psylloids were observed, including a pair in copula, which I collected. The specimens will be vouchered in Auckland Museum. They are easily identified as Casuarinicola
australis Taylor in . According to the original description, "this species can be distinguished from all other species in the genus by the female having three incomplete black terminal bands in the fore wing. The male has clear wings." Actually, the bands on the female fore wing are brown, not "black", and the male fore wing is not completely "clear", having three streaks between the veins, as is obvious from the accompanying figures therein (figs. 3-6). Nevertheless, my material (see Fig. ) exactly matches figs. 5 and 6 in , and certainly keys out to Casuarinicola
australis therein, except only that the second and third bands on the female fore wings of my specimen are narrowly joined. Such minor variation is entirely expected for insect colour patterns, and the pattern is still by far closest to that of typical Casuarinicola
australis than it is to any other species of Casuarinicola. I can find no other differences. I therefore recommend that Casuarinicola
australis be added to the New Zealand Organisms Register (NZOR) as present in the wild. Its "origin" is "exotic". Subsequently, on 20 Feb 2013, a further female specimen was found on a Casuarina tree in the Auckland suburb of Saint Johns. The second and third bands on the fore wings are separated, though narrowly (Fig. ). On 26 February 2013, the species was found to be fairly common on Casuarina trees at Thomas Bloodworth Park, Auckland. Several pairs were observed in copula. One female was collected. It has the second and third bands of one forewing joined, and of the other narrowly separated. On Casuarina in Auckland, there is also an apparently undescribed Australian species of Trioza, which is more common and widespread than Casuarinicola
australis.
