Introduction
Calliscelio
, (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) with type species Calliscelio
laticinctus Ashmead is a rather small genus, with 65 species . One strikingly colourful species, Calliscelio
elegans (Perkins, 1910), is quite widespread throughout the tropics, likely distributed by human commerce, possibly in association with cricket pests (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) of sugar cane, cf. 

During our taxonomic studies on the platygastrid subfamily Scelioninae of India, we identified 12 specimens of Calliscelio
elegans, from a series of Malaise trap samples from the semi-evergreen forests of Biligirirangan Hills, situated at the conjunction of the Western and the Eastern Ghats in Karnataka, South India. The hitherto unknown male of Calliscelio
elegans was spotted among the collections, and forms the first ever report of the male of this species. The two sexes are chromatically quite similar (Figs , ). The male has the same conspicuous banding pattern in the forewing (Fig. ) as that of the female.

We examined the types of Scelioninae at The National Zoological Collection at Western Ghat Regional Centre, Zoological Survey of India and hereby propose Calotelea
tanugatra Narendran, 1998 (Fig. ) to be a junior synonym of Calliscelio
elegans (Perkins).

A distribution map of Calliscelio
elegans in India is provided (Fig. ).

Materials and methods
Specimens for this study belonged to National Zoological Collection, at Zoological Survey Of India, Calicut (ZSIC) and also those received on loan from Western Ghats Insect Inventory Programme of Atree, Bangalore. The description and imaging work were carried out by employing Leica M205A stereomicroscope and Leica DFC-500 digital camera. The species distribution map has been generated using DIVA GIS version 7.4.

Description
New Description of Male. Length: 1.97mm (n=1) (Fig. ). Head, mesosoma, T1 wholly and anterior one-fourth of T2, legs and A1 deep orange yellow; posterior three-fourth of T2 onwards till T8, A3-A12 ebony black, A2 and ocelli darkened (Fig. ); frons (Fig. ) and mesoscutum medially with a pair of dark patches (Fig. ); apex of mandibles and apex of hind femur slightly darkened; forewing conspicuously banded, with dark bands basally, medially and apically, separated by light bands (Fig. ), with median band being most prominent as seen in females (Fig. ).

Qualitative characters of head and mesosoma being exactly similar to that of female as mentioned in , is not repeated here. However propodeum being flat and elongate, with faint longitudinal striae and irregular rugosities differs from that of the female.

Metasoma elongate, widest medially, narrowed both anteriorly and posteriorly (Fig. ); T1 with fine longitudinal striae and irregular rugose sculpture covering entire surface, almost similar to that on propodeum; longitudinal striae on T2 extending to 0.8 its length medially and about 0.5 of its length laterally. T3 distinctly transverse, shorter than T2, with delicate longitudinal aciculate sculpture, effaced medially; T4-T8 transverse, with delicate coriaceous microsculpture and with abundant appressed golden pilosity.

General body measurements, length to width proportions of antennal segments, forewing and that of metasomal segments are as follows:

Head (dorsal) L:W = 4.05:2.61mm; IOS = 1.14x eye height; POL:LOL:OOL:OD = 1.32:0.75:0.2:0.3.

A1 4.2x length of radicle, A2 1.05x longer than radicle; A3 and A4 subequal; A5 emarginate and carinate (Fig. ), 1.15x longer than A4 and 1.02X length of A6; A6 to A8 subequal, A9 to A12 subequal as long as A3, A12 longest, 1.37x A11. Length to width proportions of antennal segments from A1to A12 being 23:5.4, 5.7:4, 8:4, 8:4, 9.2:4.7, 9:4, 9:4, 9:4, 8:4, 8:4, 8:4, 11:4 (Fig. ).

ML:MW = 4.15: 3.38; Forewing narrow, 5.4x as long as wide, when at rest extending to base of T5; length of veins marginal: stigmal: postmarginal being 6:7:8.

MTL:MTW = 2.03:1.19; T2 longest of all tergites, 1.6x T1 and 1.38x T3 tergite; length to width proportions of T1-T4 being 127:85, 204:170, 148:203, 78:169; T3 onwards transverse; rest of tergites visible as strips; T8 distinct.

Diagnosis
Variation
Hardly showing any variation from the description of the female by , except for its smaller size (&lt; 2 mm). A pair of dark patches seen on median mesoscutum is not distinct in females. A few of the dense granulations on median frons appear fused as short, coarse irregular strips of striae (Fig. ), but such a partially striated nature of median frons is seen in all the female specimens of Calliscelio
elegans included in this study as well.

The eyes of one of the freshly caught specimen female had a beautiful peacock green metallic lustre (Fig. ), but turned black within 24 hours of dry preservation.

Biology
Egg parasitoid of crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) as per . The females are seen in low numbers, but the males are extremely rare.

Ecology
Females are mostly seen close to ground, in search of gryllid eggs for oviposition.

Distribution
The species is widely distributed () but generally seen in low numbers (). The distribution of Calliscelio
elegans in India has been mapped (Fig. ). It is reported only from the southern states of the country.

Notes
Quoting , “forewing with a median blackish brown band surrounded basically and apically by hyaline patches, basal and apical part infumate,”- the banding pattern of forewing (Fig. ) is correctly described, but the pattern in the illustration as of page 72, does not match the description.

Discussion
As per the generic concept of Calotelea Westwood, in , , , ​,  and , diagnosis of the genus from the very similar Calliscelio Ashmead, relies on the presence of skaphion in most cases, distinct or at least traces of genal and facial straie (Fig. ) and an elongate antennal radicle, often measuring about one-third of scape length (Fig. ). Cheeks and gena are never striate in Calliscelio and the antennal radicle is usually short, at most one-fourth length of scape (). Calotelea
tanugatra Narendran does not have any traces of striae on mandibular corners or cheeks and antennal radicle is less than one-fourth of scape length. Hence the placement of Calotelea
tanugatra under Calotelea is incorrect. Instead the species agrees in all aspects including the character states, proportions and colouration of the body and wings to Calliscelio
elegans as stated in . In contrast to most Calliscelio species, the metascutellar plate is extremely narrow and weakly concave medially in Calliscelio
elegans, as seen at times in Calotelea. Such a metascutellar plate is seen in Calotelea
tanugatra too. Hence Calotelea
tanugatra Narendran (Hymenoptera, Platygastridae) after the current review, is proposed to be a junior synonym of Calliscelio
elegans, new synonymy.

Discussion
 studied 60 female specimens of Calliscelio
elegans from all over the world, but no males were available for their study. From this observed lack of representation of male specimens in the world collections, it was opined that the male sex may either be chromatically different from the female and not so conspicuous or the species can even be thelyotokus. This fact is however disproved by our report and description of the male of Calliscelio
elegans in this study. It can be concluded that males are extremely rare compared to females and that both the sexes of Calliscelio
elegans are chromatically quite similar, with the same conspicuous banding pattern on their forewings.
