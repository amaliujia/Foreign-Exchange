Introduction
The pantropical genus Vigna Savi of the tribe Phaseoleae comprises about 90 species distributed in six subgenera (, , ). Vigna
subg.
Ceratotropis (Piper) Verdc. has its center of species diversity in Asia and is popularly known as Asian Vigna (). Earlier, it was represented by 22 species in three sections, viz. V. sect. Aconitifoliae Tomooka &amp; Maxted, sect. Angulares Tomooka &amp; Maxted and sect. Ceratotropis (Piper) Verdc. (, ). Moreover, V.
sahyadriana Aitawade et al. and V.
yadavii Gaikwad et al. have recently been described from India. Therefore, the number of species in the genus Vigna subgenus Ceratotropis is now 24.

In 2012, the authors came across an interesting species of Vigna on the hill slopes near Chalkewadi in Satara district of the Maharashtra State of India which has unusual dimorphic shoots and cleistogamous flowers. It was recollected in the subsequent two years for further studies of its vegetative and floral characters. Initially, the new species was confused with Vigna
yadavii Gaikwad et al., as both hold cleistogamous flowers. However, a critical study of floral structures, seeds, seed coat and type of seed germination have revealed that it represents an undescribed species of Vigna subg. Ceratotropis. This has been confirmed by the perusal of relevant literature (, , , , , , , , , , ​ and ) and experts' opinion on the identity of the species. The new species is described and illustrated in this paper.

Flowering and fruiting
August-October.

Diagnosis
Vigna
yadavii similis, ramis dimorphis, floribus cleistogamis vexillo sine processo carina sine marsupio corniformi, styli rostro applanato, seminum testa foveolata, hilo bene evoluto differt.

Etymology
The specific epithet honors Prof AK Pandey, Department of Botany, Delhi University, New Delhi (India), in recognition of his valuable contribution to the taxonomy of flowering plants of India.

Distribution
India, Maharashtra, Satara district, near Chalkewadi in Patan tahsil.

Ecology
It is a twining annual herb, grows on lateritic gravelly soil on hill slopes amonggrasses and herbs at about 1200 m altitude above mean sea level in Satara district of Maharashtra, India. The species has adapted to the monsoon seasonality. It thrives in humid climate with heavy rainfall during growth season. The seed germination takes place with onset of monsoon rain in the first week of June and the plant completes its life cycle with formation of seeds when rains ceasein mid October. The common associates of the species are Carvia
callosa (Nees) Bremek., Crotalaria
nana Burm. f., Crotalaria
vestita Baker, Cajanus
lineatus (Wight &amp; Arn.) Maesen, Eragrostis spp., Pseudarthria spp., Nogra
dalzellii (Baker) Merr. and Themeda spp.

Notes
Interestingly, two types of shoots are observed in the species, one a normal aerial leafy shoot and the other subterranean (close to soil surface) leafless shoot producedatthe lower nodes of the stem. The later shoots produce cleistogamous flowers, which remain closed. They show differences in the structure of their floral parts as compared to chasmogamous flowers such as standard petal without central protuberance inside, keel petals without horn-like pocket, curved style and short style beak (0.3-0.5 mm long). (Figs , , , ​). The floral parts of chasmogamous flowers roughly correspond to the floral parts of the species of Vigna sect. Ceratotropis while cleistogamous floral parts correspond to the species of V. sect. Aconitifoliae of the same subgenus. Thus, it shows a combination of characters of species of both sections. The new species shows morphological similarities with Vigna
yadavii Gaikwad et al. and Vigna
dalzelliana (Kuntze) Verdc. but differs in its dimorphic branches, foveolate seed coat and absence of standard protuberance and horn-like keel pocket in cleistogamous flowers. A comparative account between above mentioned three species is given in Table .
