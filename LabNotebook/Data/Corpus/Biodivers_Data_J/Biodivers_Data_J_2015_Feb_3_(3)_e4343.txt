Introduction
The genus Margaromantis was described by  in monotypy for Margaromantis
margaritaria Piza, 1982. After several nomenclatural changes this species is currently know as Margaromantis
planicephala (Rehn, 1916) ().

 described the species Metriomantis
planicephala Rehn which was transferred by  to a new monotypic genus Rehniella. In independent publications in the same year,  and  proposed new names for Rehniella, due to synonymy with Rehniella Herbard, 1928 (Orthoptera): in May  proposed the name Colombiella and in June  proposed the name Lombardoa. In October of the same year, after taking notice of the name proposed by ,  transformed the name Lombardoa into a new synonym to Colombiella as the latter name takes priority. Therefore, the accepted name for the species was Colombiella
planicephala (Rehn).  synonymized the species Margaromantis
margaritaria Piza, 1982 and Colombiella
planicephala (Rehn, 1916) resulting in the current nomenclature of the species Margaromantis
planicephala (Rehn).

In this paper we describe a second species of Margaromantis and discuss its geographic distribution.

Materials and methods
In this study, we examined specimens collected in inventoried areas by the Programa de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade do Semiárido (PPBio / Semiárido) and specimens deposited in the Coleção Entomológica Professor Johann Becker do Museu de Zoologia da Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana (MZFS), Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil. To study the male genitalia, the abdomina of the specimens were detached behind the eighth segment and treated according to the protocols of . Genital nomenclature follows . The specimens studied were deposited in MZFS.

The program QGIS 2.0.1 – Dufour was used to construct the map.

Measurements
Body length: holotype 35.55 mm (paratypes: 31.81–37.72 mm); head width: 5.69 mm (5.09–6.03 mm); pronotum length: 7.82 mm (7.00–8.30 mm); fore coxae: 6.26 mm (5.60–6.29 mm); fore femora: 8.39 mm (7.50–8.90 mm); fore tibia: 4.93 mm (4.41–5.23 mm); mesothoracic wings: 32.62 mm (29.20–34.63 mm); mid femura: 7.45 mm (6.67–7.91 mm); mid tibia: 5.83 mm (5.22–6.19 mm); metathoracic wings: 28.45 mm (25.46–30.20 mm); hind femura and hind tibia: 8.33 mm (7.45–8.84 mm); abdomen: 18.08 mm (16.18–19.19 mm).

Diagnosis
Vertex with a transverse black strip between compound eyes. Fore femora exhibiting black calluses on inner face. Metathoracic wings lacking yellowish strips over transverse veins. Left dorsal phallomere exhibiting a rectangular ventral lamina; lateral process elongated, grooved; apical process flattened and not twisted, upwardly recurved.

Etymology
The species epithet nigrolineata refers to the transverse black strip present on the vertex.

Distribution
Margaromantis
nigrolineata sp. n. is currently found at an altitude above 900 m in areas of central Bahia with a semiarid climate (Fig. ). Except for the locality of Maracás, all records for the new species are in the Chapada Diamantina mountains (Mucugê, Catolés, Morro do Chapéu, Palmeiras and Senhor do Bonfim). Maracás is located approximately 65 km east of the Chapada Diamantina mountains.

The Chapada Diamantina mountains are in the northern area of the Espinhaço Range, which extends from the state of Minas Gerais to Bahia (). With support from the Programa de Pesquisa em Biodiversidade do Semiárido (PPBio/Semiárido), entomological collection trips were also carried out west, east and north of Chapada Diamantina and in remnants of the Atlantic Rain Forest in the state of Bahia. However specimens of Margaromantis
nigrolineata sp. n. were not found on these trips. These results suggest that this new species may be endemic to the mountainous areas above 900 m altitude in central Bahia. Considering that specimens were not collected in the meridian part of Chapada Diamantina mountains beyond the Abaíra, it is possible that this species also occurs south of the Espinhanço Range.

Taxon discussion
Margaromantis
nigrolineata sp. n. differs from M.
planicephala by the following characteristics: 1) presence of a black strip in the vertex (Fig. ), absent in M.
planicephala; 2) fore femora with circular black callouses on the inner face (Fig. ), whereas in M.
planicephala they are ivory; 3) membrane of the metathoracic wings completely hyaline (Fig. ), without the yellowish transverse strips present in M.
planicephala; 4) the dorsal lamina in the left dorsal phallomere wider (Fig. ) than in M.
planicephala; 5) ventral lamina in the left dorsal phallomere transversely oriented, rectangular and developed, reaching the anterior margin in M.
nigrolineata sp. n. (Fig. ) and oblique, reduced and restricted the posterior region in M.
planicephala; 6) apical process in the left dorsal phallomere directed upward and not twisted in the new species (Fig. ), whereas directed sinistrally and twisted in M.
planicephala; 7) right margin of ventral phallomere a little more sclerotized in the new species than in M.
planicephala.
