Introduction
Echthronomas is a small genus of the subfamily Campopleginae (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), represented by twelve species in the world, including four in the Western Palaearctic region (). With the exception of Echthronomas
quadrinotata (Thomson, 1887), Echthronomas species, which are endoparasitoids of lepidopteran larvae, are rarely collected ().

Materials and methods
Specimens were collected by sweep netting on Corylus
avellana in beech forest (Transcarpathia) and near branches of dead Picea
abies in the mixed forest (Precarpathia). Specimens were identified using Horstmann's () keys. Specimens were sent to Klaus Horstmann and he confirmed identification. Terminology followed . The generic diagnosis is that of  with minor modifications.

Echthronomas

Casinaria
ochrostoma
 (Holmgren, 1860)

Diagnosis
Fore wing 5.3 to 8.0 mm long. Body short and stout. Eye margin indented opposite antennal socket. Clypeus small, its apex convex. Mandible short. Lower tooth of mandible a little shorter than upper tooth. Temple short. Mesopleurum matt and with strong punctures. Propodeum short, with or without well defined carinae, its basal transverse carina more or less distinct, other carinae not always present. Areola and petiolar areas, when defined, broadly confluent. Propodeal spiracle circular. Tarsal claws pectinate. Areolet pointed or petiolate. First metasomal segment slender. Glymmae present. Metasoma compressed. Thyridium subcircular, separated from base of the second tergite by 0.2 to 0.6 its diameter. Ovipositor as long as apical depth of metasoma. This genus is distinguished from other Campoplegine genera by combination of the following characters (Fig. ).

Diagnosis
Female. This species is easily distinguishable from all Echthronomas species in having a punctate propodeum, without traces of carinae, yellow frons (inner margins of eyes), face, clypeus, mandibles, malar space (Fig. ), tegula, scape and pedicel, black metasoma with tergites II–III apically yellowish and black hind femora (Fig. ). The other three species of Echthronomas have propodeum with traces of transverse carinae, entirely black frons, at least partly black face, at least partly red metasoma and red hind femora.

Echthronomas
quadrinotata

(Thomson, 1887)

Materials
Type status:
Other material. Occurrence: recordedBy: Varga A.; sex: female; Location: country: Ukraine; stateProvince: Transcarpathian region, Rakhiv district, Kvasy; verbatimElevation: 630-650 m; verbatimLatitude: 48° 08' N; verbatimLongitude: 24° 16' E; Event: eventDate: 16 August 2009

Diagnosis
Female. This species is easily distinguishable from all Echthronomas species in having a transversely wrinkled propodeum, black clypeus with two yellow lateral spots, black face and malar space (Fig. ), black fore coxae with red (yellowish) spots, black metasoma with red postpetiole apically and tergites II–IV (Fig. ).

Echthronomas
tricincta (Gravenhorst, 1829) differs from Echthronomas
quadrinotata (Thomson, 1887) in having entirely yellow fore and mid coxae, clypeus, and malar space, partly yellow face, and a black metasoma with only red apically tergites II–IV. Another species, Echthronomas
ochrostoma (Holmgren, 1860), is similar to Echthronomas
quadrinotata (Thomson, 1887), but differs in having a yellow malar space and clypeus (sometimes with a small black central spot) ().
