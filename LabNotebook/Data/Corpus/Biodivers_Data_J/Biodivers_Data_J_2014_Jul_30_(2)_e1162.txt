Introduction
Orthosiphon is a genus of around 40 species found throughout the tropical old world and with one species in Colombia (). During the preparation of the account for the Lamiaceae for Flora Zambesiaca (), a new species of Orthosiphon endemic to Angola was discovered from herbarium material. Flora Zambesiaca covers Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and the Caprivi Strip of Namibia, and five species of Orthosiphon are reported from this area of which four, Orthosiphon
schimperi Benth., Orthosiphon
thymiflorus (Roth) Sleesen, Orthosiphon
rufinervis G.Taylor, Orthosiphon
nigripunctatus G.Taylor occur in Angola. A checklist of Angolan species was provided by  which lists two further endemic species: Orthosiphon
cuanzae (I.M.Johnst.) A.J.Paton and Orthosiphon
violaceus Briq. In addition Orthosiphon
pascuensis G. Taylor should be recognized at species level, rather than as a synonym of Orthosiphon
rubicundus (D.Don) Benth sensu
. With these seven species and the new species described here, there are eight species recognized in Angola.  report three species from Angola which are not recognized here: Orthosiphon
rubicundus (D.Don) Benth. is an Asian species similar in morphology to Orthosiphon
schimperi; Orthosiphon
parvifolius Vatke is only found in East Africa. Orthosiphon
newtonii Briq is a synonym of Endostemon
tubulascens (M.Ashby) Briq. and this new synonymy is formally recorded below.

Description
Perennial subshrub 1.2–2 m tall. Stems quadrangular, pubescent, more densely so at nodes with eglandular, spreading or retrorse hairs and reddish sessile glands; inflorescence axis also with shorter glandular hairs; young shoots tomentose. Leaves petiolate; blades paler beneath, ovate, 50–120 mm long; 25–40 mm broad, shallowly serrate, base rounded to cuneate, sometimes asymmetric, pubescent with red sessile glands, grey tomentose beneath when young; petioles 8–15 mm long. Inflorescence terminal, branched at base, lax; verticils 2–6-flowered, 5–10 mm apart; bracts inconspicuous, soon deciduous; pedicels 4–5 mm long, spreading, forming a right angle with the calyx. Calyx deflexed, 4 mm long at anthesis, pubescent with reddish sessile glands; fruiting calyx 7 mm long; posterior lip erect; lateral lobes of anterior lip deltoid with posterior margin extended towards posterior lip; median lobes of anterior lip lanceolate, subulate at apex; longer than the lateral lobes. Corolla usually deflexed, pinkish, 10 mm long; tube 7 mm long, straight, dilating slightly towards throat; anterior lip cucullate enclosing stamens. Stamens 4, declinate, enclosed within the anterior lip; posterior pair inappendiculate, glabrous, adnate to the corolla above the midpoint of the tube; anterior pair glabrous, adnating nearer throat, anthers dorsifixed, synthecous. Disk 4-lobed, with anterior lobe larger. Ovary glabrous, deeply 4-lobed; style gynobasic, capitate, branches rounded, equal, adpressed. Nutlets brown, obovate with a small basal scar, minutely tuberculed, producing a small amount of mucilage when wet. Fig. .

Diagnosis
Differs from all other African species of Orthosiphon except Orthosiphon
thymiflorus (Roth) Sleesen in being a shrub rather than a suffrutex sprouting annual stems, or an annual herb. Differs from Orthosiphon
thymiflorus in being larger and more erect, 1.2–2 m tall, rather than straggling to 0.2–1.2 m tall; and with longer larger discolorous leaves, 50–120 mm long, and greyish tomentose beneath, rather than 10–40 mm long and sparsely pubescent. The flowers of Orthosiphon
cinereus are also more strongly deflexed.

Etymology
Named after the grey tomentose indumentum of the stems and abaxial leaf surfaces.

Distribution
Endemic to Angola.

Ecology
Damp area in forest; 1610–1700 m, alt.

Conservation
No recent gatherings of this species have been collected and the specimens mostly lack precise localities. This species is best viewed as data deficient.

Taxon discussion
This is a distinctive, easily recognized species, differing from the most large-leaved specimens of Orthosiphon
thymiflorus which lack the discolous, greyish leaf indumentum and have spreading rather than deflexed flowers. Orthosiphon
thymiflorus is found throughout tropical Africa and the large leaf size seen in specimens similar to the type of Orthosiphon
longipes Baker represent an extreme of the variation Fig. . Orthosiphon
longipes was placed in synonymy of Orthosiphon
thymiflorus in . The shrubby habit is seen in Asia and Madagascar Orthosiphon, Orthosiphon
aristatus (Blume) Miq. and Orthosiphon
adenocaulis
A.J.Paton &amp; Hedge being respective examples and in Orthosiphon
americanus Harley &amp; A.J.Paton from Colombia, the only New World member of the genus. However, the species in Africa are mainly suffrutices with annual stems being produced from woody rootstocks. The little habitat information available from the specimens of Orthosiphon
cinereus suggests that the species occupies a wetter forest than the seasonally dry forest habitat of Orthosiphon
thymiflorus and other Angolan species.
