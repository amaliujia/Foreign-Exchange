Introduction
Mycetophilidae (Diptera) is composed of 233 genera and ~4500 described species from all biogeographic regions (). In the Neotropical region it is one of the most species-rich dipteran families with 1145 described species ().

Mycetophilidae adults are often found in moist environments—usually in damp woods, tunnels, in the cavities under tree roots, and under stream bank overhangs (, ). All known mycetophilid larvae feed on a component of fungi or myxomycetes (mycelium, fruiting bodies and spores), but the biology of most species still remains unknown (, ).

A number of papers have been published on the biology of mycetophilids, indicating their association with fungi in the Palearctic and Nearctic (e.g., , , , , ). Unfortunately their role in forest ecosystems as fungivores remains virtually unexplored (but see ). The most comprehensive review on the morphology of immature Mycetophilidae
s.l. is the series of papers by Plachter (, , ), though a number of important earlier contributions should be noted (, , ). Information on the biology of Leptomorphus has also been recently studied (, ). However, nothing has been reported on the larval biology of Neotropical species of Mycetophilidae. Here we provide the first observations on the larvae of a Neotropical species of mycetophilid, Neoempheria
puncticoxa Edwards and its fungal associations, along with morphological descriptions of the different life stages.

Materials and methods
Samples of fungi were collected in two different areas of Brazil, one in the State of Goiás (by FFA) and another in the northeast part of the State of São Paulo (by CJB and SSO). Both these areas have a biome classified as Semi-deciduous Forest, with a dry season from June to September. The fungi samples with mycetophilid larvae were transferred to plastic jars covered by a fine mesh. Samples were misted daily with water to maintain humidity. Five adults emerged from the fungi. All material examined, with the exception of the holotype, was kept pinned, preserved in 80% alcohol, or on slides, and housed in the Diptera collection of the Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de São Paulo (MZSP), São Paulo, Brazil. The holotype of N.
puncticoxa was examined at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London, UK (additional information on the holotype is available in ).

Methods for the preparation of specimens, photos and illustrations follow . Morphological terminology follows  and  for adults and  for larvae. Field photos were taken with either a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera with a Canon EF 100mm F2.8 L IS USM Macro lens and Canon Speedlite 580EX II Flash (FFA), or a Canon PowerShot SX200IS (CJB).

Diagnosis
Adults. Laterotergite mostly yellow, anterodorsal margin brownish, bare. Mediotergite yellow ventrally, a brownish triangular mark dorsally, bare. Gonocoxite with large dorsal projection extending beyond apex of gonostylus; gonostylus well developed, deeply bifid, inner branch secondarily bifid and nearly bare, a few small spines on inner margin, external branch strongly setose; parameres strongly developed, with a dorsal, membranous, bare projection. Female apical cercomere rounded, ~¼ length of basal cercomere.

Biology
Larvae were found on two different species of polypore fungus, indicating that this species can feed on multiple fungi species, as found in other genera of the family (, ). All larvae were collected with the fungus fruiting bodies they were feeding on; those from São Paulo state (all reared material female) were feeding on an uncertain species of Sparassis (Polyporales: Sparassidaceae) (Fig. ), and those from Goiânia (all reared material male) were collected on an undetermined species of Polyporaceae (Fig. ). Both fungi were determined by J.M. Baltazar in vii.2013 using photographs (Fig. ).

Larvae of N.
puncticoxa crawled over the surface of the fungal fruiting body (sporocarp), moving along slime trails and silk lines (Fig. ) they produced. Those on the Sparassis sp. often had webs and slime trails suspended between the lamellae of the fungus. The specimens collected on the polypore from Goiânia spent most of their time feeding on the pore surface (underside) of the fungus. It was not observed whether they dig into either sporocarp or not, though there were numerous small holes on the fungus in the region where the larvae were residing. It is probable that they were ingesting the sporulating surfaces of the sporocarp. In preparation for pupation the larvae spun an irregular web, approximating a loosely woven cocoon, and then pupated in the centre of that cocoon, hanging over the substrate with the ventral part of the body facing downwards (Figs , , ). The droplets present on the web strands (Figs , ) may be acidic and serve a protective function, as seen in other Sciaroidea (, ), though this was not tested in our study.

Taxon discussion
 and  both mentioned morphological variation between males and females of N.
puncticoxa.  highlighted that the pleural marks in females were more pronounced than in the males. We observed the same range of variation in the material we reared (Figs , ).

Discussion
Final remarks
The use of immature data for a phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships within the Mycetophilidae is still in its infancy, though there is growing information on larvae and pupae of different genera (, ). There are clear differences between the genera of mycetophilids in terms of larval and pupal morphology, which would provide a novel set of characters for phylogenetic analysis. There are, also differences in biology in terms of fungal taxa on which larvae feed, on how they move and feed on the fungus, how they pupate etc.

With increased information on the natural history of this and related Sciaroidea families, it will be possible to gain a better understanding of the evolution of fungus/Sciaroidea associations, as previously explored for the Keroplatidae () and for Sciaridae (). Particularly in the Neotropics there is a huge open field in front of us, with information on the biology and natural history of different genera just begging to be discovered, as for putative species of Mycetophila Meigen (also reared by SSO), other species of Neoempheria, as well as the first association between Leia Meigen and its host fungi of the genus Agaricus L. (Marco Gottschalk and Felipe B. Valer pers. comm.).
