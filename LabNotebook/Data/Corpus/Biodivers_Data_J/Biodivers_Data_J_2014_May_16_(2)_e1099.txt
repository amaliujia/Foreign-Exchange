Introduction
Shaken Creek Preserve (“SCP”) contains among the highest-quality savanna and flatwoods habitats known throughout the range of longleaf pine (Pinus
palustris Mill.) ecosystems (). The 2,448 ha (6,050 ac) site is located in northeastern Pender County, North Carolina, with a small portion extending into adjacent Onslow County. Formerly a private hunting club, SCP was purchased by The Nature Conservancy in 2007. Previous botanical studies on site consisted of inventory work by  and plot studies by the Carolina Vegetation Survey (). However, neither of these studies involved systematic surveying over multiple growing seasons, and neither included significant collecting efforts. Moreover, some savannas and flatwoods on site were not inventoried by either study. The goals of this study were to (1) inventory the vascular flora of the savanna, flatwoods, and sandhill community types on site through the collection of voucher specimens; (2) provide a comprehensive checklist of the flora based on collections and reports made from the site and from the same or similar habitats in the vicinity (i.e., within 2 miles of SCP, including all tracts comprising Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area); and (3) create an illustrated guide based on the checklist.

Setting
SCP is a 2,448 ha (6,050 ac) tract located between 34.566° and 34.611°N and 77. 614° and 77.720°W in northeastern Pender County, North Carolina, with a small portion extending approximately 0.3 km into Onslow County (Fig. ). The geographic center of the site is approximately 8.3 km south-southeast of Maple Hill, NC and 21 km northwest of the nearest point in the Atlantic Ocean. The site lies in the outer Coastal Plain ecophysiographic province and within the Cape Fear Arch geological uplift, a region extending from southeastern North Carolina into northeastern South Carolina that is characterized by unusual outcroppings of Cretaceous deposits. This area supports a suite of at least forty-four endemic or near-endemic plant taxa, many of which are rare ().

A small portion of SCP extends to the south of Shaken Creek, which otherwise forms the southern boundary of the property. The northeastern boundary follows Shelter Swamp Creek, while Flo Road west of its intersection with Williams Road forms the northwestern boundary (Fig. ). With a small exception in the extreme northwest corner of the property, Long Ridge Road outlines the western property boundary. The irregular eastern boundary does not consistently follow any natural features or landmark. SCP is bordered to the southwest by Holly Shelter Gameland; to the northeast by Haw’s Run Mitigation Site, a future component of Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area; and in other directions by private land. Primary access is south along Williams Road from NC Highway 50, though the site is not openly accessible to the public.

Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area (“Sandy Run”) is a 1,214 ha (3,000 ac) site north of SCP (Fig. ). It is comprised of seven tracts, six of which are currently owned by the NC Division of Parks and Recreation. One tract, Haw’s Run Mitigation Site, which abuts the northeastern portion of SCP, is currently owned by the NC Department of Transportation; however, transfer of this parcel to the NC Division of Parks and Recreation is impending. The various tracts comprising Sandy Run have experienced different management and land use histories, creating an array of habitats including several high-quality savannas and flatwoods. The flora of Sandy Run was recently inventoried by . Though some portions of Sandy Run are slightly farther than two miles from SCP, vouchers or reports from all Sandy Run tracts were included in this work.

Holly Shelter Game Land is a 26,200 ha (64,742 ac) property south of SCP (Fig. ). It is owned by the NC Wildlife Resources Commission, which manages the land for public outdoor recreation, particularly hunting and fishing. Only the northeast portion of the property lies within two miles of SCP; as such, plant vouchers or reports from other areas of Holly Shelter are not included in this work.

History and Land Use
Prior to its purchase by The Nature Conservancy, the land comprising SCP was owned mostly by members of the Wallace Deer Club, a private hunting group established in the 1920s. The site was virtually unknown to scientists until 1997, when William Blanchard, a member of the Wallace Deer Club and part owner of the land, introduced it to Hervey McIver, a land manager and project coordinator with The Nature Conservancy. With permission from Blanchard, McIver and Richard LeBlond, then a botanist with the NC Natural Heritage Program, undertook the first preliminary surveys of the area and realized quickly that the site contained exceptionally high-quality savannas and numerous rare species. At the time, McIver was working with Blanchard to complete a deed to The Nature Conservancy for fifty acres Blanchard owned in the nearby Neck Savanna, now a tract within Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area. Blanchard suggested that the land now comprising SCP should also be permanently conserved and eventually agreed to sell his shares of the property. However, purchasing SCP required not just the approval of Blanchard, but of all the approximately fifty landowners who inherited or purchased property rights to the site. After three years of negotiations, The Nature Conservancy closed on the property in 2007. Members of the Wallace Deer Club retained hunting rights to the property, but the site is now owned and managed by The Nature Conservancy.

The excellent quality of many of the savannas on site, as evidenced by the abundance of rare species, the high species richness, and the absence of invasive species, can be directly attributed to the Wallace Deer Club, whose members frequently burned particular areas in order to maintain both the hunting quality and the aesthetic of the land. Evidence of disturbances other than fire in the savannas and flatwoods on site is limited to a few ditches and occasional “borrow pits”, relatively small holes dug to “borrow” the soil in order to regrade and maintain the dirt roads on the property. Based on the size of the canopy trees, many savannas and flatwoods appear to have been logged as recently as the 1980s, though few or no effects on the ground layer are apparent today. Overall, the habitat quality of the site (especially those areas historically burned by members of the hunting club) remains excellent ().

Climate
The climate at SCP is warm, temperate, and humid for much of the year. The nearest weather station is approximately 29 km away in Jacksonville (Onslow County: 34.7°N, 77.383°W) at 4.9 m above sea level. Over the thirty-year period from 1971 to 2000, the average annual temperature was 17.1 °C, with a mean annual precipitation of 1,397 mm. Average daily maximum temperature was 23.1 °C, and average daily minimum temperature was 11 °C (State Climate Office of NC, ; Fig. ). The next closest weather station is approximately 35 km away in Willard (Pender County: 34.661°N, 78.046°W) at 16.7 m above sea level. Over the thirty-year period from 1971 to 2000, the average annual temperature was 17.7 °C, with a mean annual precipitation of 1,377 mm. Average daily maximum temperature was 24.2 °C, and average daily minimum temperature was 11.1 °C (State Climate Office of NC, ; Fig. ). For both stations, monthly average temperatures were highest in July and August and lowest in January and February. Monthly precipitation amounts were highest in July and August for both stations and lowest in April and October in Jacksonville and April and November in Willard.

The annual growing season, defined as the number of days in five years out of ten during which the daily minimum temperatures exceed 28 °F (-2.2 °C), is 235 days in Pender County and 210 days in Onslow County (, ).

Elevation at SCP ranges from 4 m (13 ft) to 12.9 m (42 ft) above sea level (NC Department of Transportation, ).

Soils
Twelve soil types representing five soil orders are mapped at SCP (, ; Fig. ). Ultisols are the most abundant in type, though Spodosols are the most abundant in area. Entisols comprise 21.4% of the total area and are the dominant soil order along Shaken Creek and Shelter Swamp Creek. While most areas mapped as Entisols support swamp communities, a few savannas do occur over Entisols, as along Alligator Lake Road and the eastern portion of Mule Pen Road. Histosols comprise 8.7% of the total area and, with one small exception, are restricted to the central western portion of the property, which is dominated by Pond Pine Woodland (Typic subtype) and High Pocosin (Typic subtype) communities (sensu ). No savanna or savanna-like community types are known to occur on Histosols at SCP. Inceptisols comprise 14.2% of the total area and are the dominant order in the central eastern portion of the property, an area that has not been managed with fire in many decades. Excepting one very small area on the west side of the north end of Alligator Lake Road, no savannas or savanna-like areas occur at SCP in areas mapped as Inceptisols. Spodosols comprise 36.6% of the total area and are the dominant soil order in the central, northwestern, and southestern portions of the property. Excellent examples of savannas and flatwoods occurring over Spodosols are apparent along Half Moon Road, Long Ridge Road, and the portion of Flo Road between the powerline right of way and Meadow Lake Road. Ultisols comprise 19.1% of the total area and are the dominant order in the northeastern and southeastern portions of the property. Many of the most species-rich savannas, most notably those along Flo Road east of its intersection with Fill Road, occur in areas mapped as Ultisols.

A brief synopsis of each of the twelve soil types, arranged by soil order, is provided below.


Entisols


Muckalee (Mk) loam, frequently flooded (Coarse-loamy, siliceous, superactive, non-acid, thermic Typic Fluvaquents)

Poorly-drained soils on floodplains. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is loam in the upper 30 cm and sandy loam with thin strata of loamy sand or sand from 30 cm to 150 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 15 cm and 46 cm below the soil surface and are frequently flooded for brief periods (). This is the primary mapping unit along Shaken Creek and Shelter Swamp Creek and is occupied predominantly by Blackwater Bottomland Hardwoods (High subtype) and other swamp communities.

Pactolus (PaA) fine sand (Thermic, coated Aquic Quartzipsamments)

Moderately well-drained or somewhat poorly-drained soils in slight depressions in uplands and on low ridges on terraces. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is fine sand to 200 cm below the soil surface. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 46 cm and 76 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). This mapping unit occurs primarily in narrow bands along the southern portion of the property. Three examples of the Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna community occur on Pactolus soils.


Histosols


Croatan (Ct) muck (Loamy, siliceous, dysic, thermic Terric Haplosaprists)

Very poorly-drained soils on interstream divides. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is muck in the upper 89 cm, fine sandy loam between 89 cm and 114 cm, sandy clay loam between 114 cm and 191 cm, and fine sandy loam between 191 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table at or near the soil surface for about six months and are rarely flooded for brief periods (). This mapping unit is nearly restricted to the central-western portion of the property and supports Pond Pine Woodland (Typic subtype) and High Pocosin (Typic subtype) communities.


Inceptisols


Torhunta (To) mucky fine sandy loam (Coarse-loamy, siliceous, active, acid, thermic Typic Humaquepts)

Very poorly-drained soils on interstream areas and on stream terraces. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is mucky fine sandy loam in the upper 8 cm, fine sandy loam between 8 cm and 152 cm, and sandy loam and sand to 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 15 cm and 46 cm below the soil surface and are rarely flooded for brief periods (). This mapping unit occupies the central-eastern portion of the property, a fire-suppressed area that supports few or no savanna, flatwood, or sandhill communities.


Spodosols


Leon (LnA) fine sand (Sandy, siliceous, thermic Aeric Alaquods)

Poorly-drained soils on interstream areas. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is fine sand to 200 cm below the soil surface. These soils have a seasonal high water table less than 30 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). This is the primary mapping unit of the central portion of the property and is well-represented along Half Moon Road and the portion of Flo Road between the powerline cut and Meadow Lake Road. The best and most accessible examples of Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype), Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype), and Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush featherling subtype) are found in areas mapped as Leon fine sand.

Mandarin (Ma) fine sand (Sandy, siliceous, thermic Oxyaquic Alorthods)

Somewhat poorly-drained soils on moderately elevated areas in interstream divides. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is fine sand in the upper 101 cm and sand between 101 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 46 cm and 107 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). This mapping unit is restricted to narrow ridges in the central and western portions of the property. The largest example is in the northwest corner of the property south of Long Ridge Road, which supports extensive Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) and Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype) communities.

Murville (Mu) muck (Sandy, siliceous, thermic Umbric Endoaquods)

Very poorly-drained soils on interstream areas and in depressions. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is muck in the upper 8 cm, mucky fine sand between 8 cm and 28 cm, fine sand between 28 cm and 124 cm, loamy fine sand between 124 cm and 140 cm, and fine sand between 140 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table less than 30 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). This mapping unit is the largest in area at SCP and dominates the west-central and western portions of the property. It is particularly abundant north of Mule Pen Road and along the portion of Indian Grave Road east of the powerline cut. Most areas mapped as Murville support Pond Pine Woodland (Typic subtype) communities.


Ultisols


Baymeade (BaB) fine sand (Loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Arenic Hapludults)

Well-drained soils on low ridges and convex slopes in uplands. Slopes are 1–4%. Typical soil texture is fine sand in the upper 64 cm, fine sandy loam between 64 cm and 148 cm, and fine sand between 148 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 122 cm and 152 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). The smallest mapping unit on site, Baymeade fine sand is restricted to one area north of Mule Pen Road, approximately 1 km west of the intersection of Mule Pen Road and Williams Road. This small area is among the driest and “hilliest” at SCP and supports a Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype) community.

Foreston (Fo) loamy fine sand (Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aquic Paleudults)

Moderately well-drained soils on slightly convex interstream divides near shallow drainageways. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is loamy fine sand in the upper 33 cm, fine sandy loam between 33 cm and 102 cm, fine sandy loam with pockets of loamy fine sand between 102 cm and 140 cm, fine sandy loam with strata of loamy sand between 140 cm and 168 cm, and sandy clay loam with strata of sand and sandy loam between 168 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 76 cm and 107 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). Scattered throughout the property, this mapping unit is perhaps best represented along Flo Road near its intersection with Fill Road, an area that supports high-quality Wet Loamy Pine Savanna communities and, in depressional areas, Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna communities.

Pantego (Pn) mucky fine sandy loam (Fine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Umbric Paleaquults)

Very poorly-drained soils on interstream areas. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is mucky fine sandy loam in the upper 25 cm, fine sandy loam between 25 cm and 61 cm, sandy clay loam between 61 cm and 150 cm, clay loam with strata of sandy clay loam between 150 cm and 183 cm, and sandy clay loam with thin strata of loamy sand between 183 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table within 46 cm of the soil surface and are rarely flooded for brief periods (). This mapping unit is restricted to a small area in the extreme east-central portion of the property. No savannas, flatwoods, or sandhills are known from this area.

Stallings (St) loamy fine sand (Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Aeric Paleaquults)

Somewhat poorly-drained soils on interstream areas and in shallow depressions on convex divides. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is loamy fine sand in the upper 30 cm, fine sandy loam between 30 cm and 114 cm, fine sandy loam with pockets of sandy clay loam between 114 cm and 168 cm, and sandy clay loam with thin layers of fine sandy loam between 168 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 46 cm and 76 cm below the soil surface and are not subject to flooding (). As with the preceding map unit, Stallings loamy fine sand is restricted to a small area in the extreme east-central portion of the property. No savannas, flatwoods, or sandhills are known from this area.

Woodington (Wo) fine sandy loam (Coarse-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Paleaquults)

Poorly-drained soils on interstream areas and in depressions near drainageways. Slopes are 0–2%. Typical soil texture is fine sandy loam in the upper 43 cm and fine sandy loam with pockets or strata of loamy fine sand between 43 cm and 200 cm. These soils have a seasonal high water table between 15 cm and 30 cm below the soil surface and are not generally subject to flooding, though low areas may be subject to ponding for brief periods (). This mapping unit occurs commonly in the northeastern and southeastern portions of the property, particularly along Bug Ridge Road, at the graded end of Half Moon Road, and along the far eastern portion of Flo Road. Scattered and usually small examples of savannas, flatwoods, and sandhills occur in areas mapped as Woodington fine sandy loam.

Plant Community Types
Seven savanna, flatwoods, or sandhill plant community types were distinguished at SCP following  (Table ). Among these community types, three are globally critically imperiled (G1); the remainder are globally imperiled or vulnerable (G2G3). In general, the drier savanna or savanna-like community types (i.e., Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype) and Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain subtype)) are restricted to slightly-elevated ridges that occur mostly in the central and western portions of the property; other areas on site are typically dominated by wetter community types (i.e., Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) or one of the four Wet Pine Savanna community types; Fig. ).

As is true of most longleaf pine-dominated communities, all the community types treated herein are dependent on frequent, low-intensity fires to maintain their integrity (Figs , ).

Though this work examines only savanna or savanna-like community types, it is worth noting that numerous other plant community types are present at SCP. Examples include Blackwater Bottomland Hardwoods (High subtype) along Shaken Creek and Shelter Swamp Creek, High Pocosin (Typic subtype) along the domed west-central portion of the property, and Pond Pine Woodland (Typic subtype and Canebrake subtype) along portions of Williams Road and Half Moon Road (Fig. ).

In the following discussion community types are presented in order from driest to wettest (i.e., according to increasing soil moisture). For each community type the most similar NatureServe association (see ) is provided in brackets.

Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype; S2S3, G2G3) [Pinus
palustris / Quercus
incana / Aristida
stricta - Sorghastrum
nutans - Anthaenantia
villosa Woodland (CEGL003578)]. This community type is somewhat common in the Sandhills and outer Coastal Plain of North Carolina but is rare at SCP. Areas of this community type in which collection efforts have been made comprise approximately 4 ha (10 ac), all in the western portion of the property, particularly along Mule Pen Road. Associated soil series are Baymeade (Arenic Hapludult), Foreston (Aquic Paleudult), and Pactolus (Aquic Quartzipsamment; ).

The canopy is dominated by Pinus
palustris and several oak species, including Quercus
falcata Michx., Quercus
incana W. Bartram, Quercus
margarettae (Ashe) Small, and Quercus
marilandica
Münchh.
var.
marilandica. Understory species include Diospyros
virginiana L., Gaylussacia
dumosa (Andrews) Torr. &amp; A. Gray, Gaylussacia
frondosa (L.) Torr. &amp; A. Gray ex Torr., Sassafras
albidum J. Presl, and Vaccinium
tenellum Aiton. Vines are not abundant, but Gelsemium
sempervirens J. St.-Hil. and Smilax
glauca Walter are occasionally present. In the herb layer, Aristida
stricta Michx. is abundant, and several dry-mesic species that are not found in the other communities (except sometimes in Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain subtype)) occur, including Euphorbia
ipecacuanhae L., Lespedeza
hirta
(L.) Hornem.
var.
curtissii (Clewell) Isely, and Tragia
urens L.

This community type is similar to and grades into Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain Subtype), from which it is distinguished by a substantial component of scrub oaks and by a less diverse herbaceous layer that generally contains fewer legume species. Most examples on site are fire-suppressed; in some cases, fire has not occurred in at least twenty years. To what extent the abundance of oaks in these cases is due simply to fire suppression rather than other environmental factors is unclear. Overall, this community type is not degraded as quickly in the absence of fire as other, wetter community types, which are subject to more rapid shrub invasion.

Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain subtype; S2, G2G3) [Pinus
palustris / Amorpha
herbacea
var.
herbacea / Aristida
stricta - Sorghastrum
nutans Woodland (CEGL003569)]. This community type is uncommon in North Carolina and rare at SCP. Areas of this community type in which collection efforts have been made comprise approximately 3.6 ha (9 ac), with the largest tract along Indian Grave Road and smaller tracts north of Alligator Lake Road. Sporadic examples of this community type occur in slightly elevated areas within Wet Loamy Pine Savannas and Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas; however, due to their small size, such examples are not mapped. The soil series most commonly associated with this community type is Pactolus (Aquic Quartzipsamment), though small areas of this commuity type are mapped as Woodington (Typic Paleaquult; ).

The canopy is dominated by Pinus
palustris; oak species are generally absent or sparse. Understory species include Gaylussacia
dumosa, Gaylussacia
frondosa, and Vaccinium
tenellum. Amorpha
georgiana Wilbur and Amorpha
herbacea
Walter
var.
herbacea are excellent indicators when present, though these are not usually abundant. Vine species include Apios
americana Medik. and Centrosema
virginianum (L.) Benth., which are generally absent in other communities. The diverse ground layer includes several species not known from other community types, including Danthonia
sericea Nutt., Lechea
minor L., Lespedeza
angustifolia (Pursh) Elliott, and Stylosanthes
biflora (L.) Britton, Sterns &amp; Poggenb.

This community type is similar to Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype), from which it is best distinguished by the absence of scrub oaks or their presence combined with wetland species, and a more diverse herbaceous layer that contains a relatively abundant and diverse component of legume species. It is distinguished from the Wet Pine Savanna community types by the lack of carnivorous plants species, the relative abundance and diversity of legume species, and the dominance of only one bunchgrass species, Aristida
stricta, with little or no Sporobolus
pinetorum Weakley &amp; P.M. Peterson, no Ctenium
aromaticum, and no Muhlenbergia
expansa (Poir.) Trin.

Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype; S3, G3) [Pinus
palustris / Ilex
glabra / Aristida
stricta Woodland (CEGL003648)] (Fig. )

The canopy consists of Pinus
palustris and Pinus
serotina Michx., with occasional Pinus
taeda L. In addition to those species listed for the preceding community types, the sometimes-dense shrub layer also contains species characteristic of wetter soils, such as Ilex
glabra (L.) A. Gray, Kalmia
carolina Small, Lyonia
mariana (L.) D. Don, Morella
pumila (Michx.) Small, Rhododendron
atlanticum (Ashe) Rehder, and Rhododendron
viscosum (L.) Torr. Few vine taxa are present, though Smilax
laurifolia L. is sometimes abundant. The dense herbaceous layer is dominated by Aristida
stricta, usually with Vaccinium
crassifolium Andrews codominant. Pyxidanthera
barbulata Michx. and Pteridium
aquilinum
(L.) Kuhn
var.
pseudocaudatum (Clute) A. Heller are often subdominant and, when abundant, are good indicators of this community type.

The use of the terms “flatwoods” and “savannas” is notoriously variable, and sometimes contradictory, from person to person. In general “flatwoods” has been used to designate savanna-like areas that are shrubbier and/or less floristically diverse than true savannas. This work follows  in distinguishing flatwoods by their floristic composition and lower small-scale species richness. While Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) may have a naturally denser shrub layer than savannas, essentially all the community types treated in this work become shrubby in the absence of fire; relative shrub dominance is, therefore, a poor indicator of community type. Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) often grades into Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype), particularly on Spodosol soils. In these cases Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) can be distinguished by the abundance of Pyxidanthera
barbulata, Pteridium
aquilinum
var.
pseudocaudatum, and Vaccinium
crassifolium; the absence or near-absence of bunchgrass species characteristic of wetter sites, particularly Ctenium
aromaticum and Muhlenbergia
expansa; the absence of carnivorous species (with the exception of species of Drosera L.); and an overall lower small-scale species richness. In fire-suppressed areas, it is often difficult to determine whether the natural community type is Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) or one of the Wet Pine Savannas, though some insight can be obtained by searching for remnant bunchgrasses and carnivorous plants, particularly species of Sarracenia L.

Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype; S3, G3) [Pinus
palustris - Pinus
serotina / Ctenium
aromaticum - Muhlenbergia
expansa - Carphephorus
odoratissimus Woodland (CEGL003658)]. Relatively common in North Carolina, this community type is the most common Wet Pine Savanna community at SCP. It often occurs in a mosaic with the closely related Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype). In areas where these two community types co-occur, Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) generally occurs on slightly-elevated, drier sites and Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype) on sites that are somewhat lower and wetter. The total area occupied by this community type at SCP is estimated at 13 ha (33 ac), with another 24 ha (60 ac) existing in a mosaic with Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype). Associated soil series are Leon (Aeric haplaquod) and Mandarin (Typic haplohumod; ).

Canopy species are Pinus
palustris and Pinus
serotina. The composition of the shrub layer is geneally the same as Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype), though shrub density is often somewhat lower. As above, vines are sparse, but Smilax
laurifolia is sometimes abundant, particularly in unburned areas. The species-rich herbaceous layer usually contains all the species present in Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype) plus many more, including several grasses (Andropogon
glaucopsis Steud., Andropogon
glomeratus (Walter) Britton, Sterns, &amp; Poggenb., Sporobolus
pinetorum, and, less commonly, Ctenium
aromaticum), carnivorous plants (Dionaea
muscipula J. Ellis and Sarracenia
flava L.), and other herbs (Osmundastrum
cinnamomeum (L.) C. Presl and Polygala
lutea L.).

While Pleea
tenuifolia Michx. is often found in Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype), occurrences are scattered, and the species as a whole comprises only a minor component of the flora. In the closely-related Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush Featherling subtype), Pleea
tenuifolia is a dominant species, generally as or more abundant than any single bunchgrass species. Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype) can be distinguished from Wet Loamy Pine Savanna and Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna by its coarser-textured soils and by the absence of a suite of species characteristic of wetter, richer sites, including Chaptalia
tomentosa Vent., Cirsium
virginianum (L.) Michx., Eryngium spp., Lysimachia
loomisii Torr., Polygala
hookeri Torr. &amp; A. Gray, Polygala
ramosa Elliott, and many species of Rhynchospora Vahl.

Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush Featherling subtype; S1, G1) [Pinus
palustris - Pinus
serotina / Pleea
tenuifolia - Aristida
stricta Woodland (CEGL003661)] (Fig. )

This community type is very similar to Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype); both share the same canopy and vine species and most of the same herb species. However, the Rush Featherling subtype is distinguished by the dominance of Pleea
tenuifolia, whose abundant white flowers in early autumn give rise to the colloquial community name “Snow in September.” The thick rhizomes of Pleea
tenuifolia produce dense, broad clumps that create a somewhat hummocky topography. Species richness and diversity are sometimes lower in the Rush Featherling subtype than in the Typic subtype due to the sheer dominance of Pleea
tenuifolia. The environmental factors responsible for this community type are unclear. At SCP both the Rush Featherling and Typic subtypes occur on Leon soils and in close proximity to one another. However, the author has noticed that Pleea
tenuifolia is sometimes abundant in local depressions within the Typic subtype, an observation that suggests that Pleea
tenuifolia possibly favors wetter soils. Perhaps, then, the Rush featherling subtype has a somewhat higher water table than the Typic subtype, though this hypothesis has not been tested.

Wet Loamy Pine Savanna (S1, G1) [Pinus
palustris - Pinus
serotina / Ctenium
aromaticum - Muhlenbergia
expansa - Rhynchospora
latifolia Woodland (CEGL003660)] (Fig. )

The canopy is dominated by Pinus
palustris and Pinus
serotina, with occasional Pinus
taeda. The sparse to nearly absent understory consists of species similar to other Wet Pine Savanna community types. Vines are scarce, though several Smilax species treated in this work have been collected in thickets along the roadside edge of Wet Loamy Pine Savannas. The herbaceous layer is very diverse and generally includes all taxa present in the Sandy Pine Savanna communities plus many other taxa. Among bunchgrasses, Ctenium
aromaticum, Muhlenbergia
expansa, and Sporobolus
pinetorum dominate or co-dominate with Aristida
stricta. Herbs that are often present in Wet Loamy Pine Savannas but not in Sandy Pine Savannas include Chaptalia
tomentosa, Cirsium
virginianum, Eryngium L. spp., Lysimachia
loomisii, Polygala
hookeri, Polygala
ramosa, and many Rhynchospora spp.

As their names imply, both Loamy Pine Savanna community types are distinguished from Sandy Pine Savanna community types by somewhat finer-textured soils. In general, finer-textured soils are more fertile than and have a higher water-holding capacity than coarser-textured soils—conditions that would seem to be favorable to the growth of most plant species. These environmental factors may explain, at least partially, the exceptionally high species richness of the Loamy Pine Savanna communities (). Wet Loamy Pine Savannas are distinguished from Mesic Pine Savannas (Coastal Plain subtype) by the abundance of wetland plants and the near absence of legumes. Wet Loamy Pine Savannas are distinguished from Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas by a lower abundance of boggy species (e.g., Eriocaulon

Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna (S1, G1) [Pinus
palustris - Pinus
serotina / Magnolia
virginiana / Sporobolus
teretifolius - Carex
striata Woodland (CEGL004500)] (Fig. )

Canopy species include those of other Wet Pine Savannas, though Pinus
palustris is often less abundant. Taxodium
ascendens, not usually found in the other communities, also frequently occurs. Shrub species that are more common in this community type than in others include Morella
cerifera (L.) Small and Ilex
myrtifolia Walter. Vines are generally uncommon, though Mikania
scandens (L.) Willd. and Toxicodendron
radicans
(L.) Kuntze
var.
radicans are more likely to be found in this community type, particularly along swampy margins or in unburned sites, than in other community types. The herbaceous layer may include all taxa present in other Wet Pine Savannas plus an additional suite of rare species: Allium species 1, Carex
lutea, and Thalictrum
cooleyi, all of which are strong indicators for this community type. Aristida
stricta is often scarce or even entirely absent, replaced by other bunchgrass species, particularly Muhlenbergia
expansa. Many wetland herbs that are sometimes found in Wet Loamy Pine Savannas are often much more abundant in Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas. Examples inlcude Carex
striata Michx., Chaptalia
tomentosa, and Eryngium spp. Boggy species, like Eriocaulon
decangulare
var.
decangulare and Lachnocaulon
anceps, which are restricted to borrow pits and depressions in other community types, are also more likely to occur in the savannas proper of this community type.

Globally, Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas have a small, patchy distribution, and the environmental factors responsible for their occurrence are unclear. As noted by , the abundance of wetland species would seem to indicate a wetter soil than that of Wet Loamy Pine Savannas. In most cases, however, Wet Loamy Pine Savannas grade directly into swamps or pocosins on their wet edges; why in rare cases Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas form in these ecotonal positions is uncertain. The natural fire frequency of Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas is also unclear but may be somewhat lower than that of the other savanna communities due to a higher water table and a suspected slightly higher natural shrub density. Some Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas exhibit localized inclusions of calcium (in the form of marl) that increase soil pH in small areas (). Rare in the Coastal Plain of NC, these inclusions were once thought to explain the curious distribution of this community type; however, many calcium deposits underlying Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas appear to be several feet below the soil surface, where they would presumably exert little impact on the pH of the upper portion of the soil in which most plants root. Moreover, one study () suggested that even in Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas in which inclusions of high pH have been reported, most of the soil throughout the savanna is still strongly acidic. Further research into the environmental factors associated with this community type is certainly warranted.

Materials and methods
Preliminary Species List
A preliminary list of plant taxa reported from SCP by  and by the Carolina Vegetation Survey () was compiled. Taxa collected or reported from various tracts comprising Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area were also included; for these taxa, the following sources were referenced: , , , . Finally, taxon reports for Pender and Onslow Counties were obtained from the US Southeastern Flora Atlas (), a resource that incorporates pertinent records from the USDA PLANTS Database (), , and any specimens databased to-date by several herbaria, including those of North Carolina State University (NCSC) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (NCU). Culled from this initial checklist were taxa either reported by the various sources in habitats other than those studied in the present thesis or, in the case of the county records obtained through the Southeastern Flora Atlas, taxa whose habitat description in  did not include savannas, flatwoods, or similar habitats. The resulting condensed list was subsequently used to search the herbarium collections of Duke University (DUKE), NCSC, NCU, and the University of North Carolina Wilmington (WNC) for any historic collections made from pertinent habitats in SCP, in tracts now comprising Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area, or in other areas within two miles of SCP (Fig. ).

Field Work
Field work began in August 2010 and continued through October 2012. In order to capture the floristic diversity of SCP throughout the growing season, collecting trips (N=81) were made approximately weekly from mid-March 2011 through November 2011, biweekly from December 2011 to February 2012, weekly from early March 2012 through early September 2012, and biweekly from early September 2012 through mid-October 2012. Collecting efforts in 2011 centered on the extensive Wet Pine Savanna and Wet Pine Flatwoods community types along Flo Road and Half Moon Road (Fig. ). In 2012 collection efforts extended to include all Wet Pine Savanna and Wet Pine Flatwoods community types throughout the property and the relatively few examples of Mesic Pine Savanna and Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill community types on site (Fig. ). Voucher specimens were collected in duplicate (or more) and deposited at NCSC. In addition, leaf samples were taken from most vouchers, desiccated in silica gel, and deposited in the NCSC DNA bank (see herbarium.ncsu.edu), where available for use by the scientific community. Specimen determinations were made by Robert Thornhill and were verified by the following: Richard LeBlond (Dichanthelium), Dr. Jon Stucky (Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, and Poaceae excluding Dichanthelium), and Dr. Alexander Krings (all other taxa). A list of all voucher specimens and associated data (except location data for rare or over-collected taxa) can be found in Suppl. material .

Checklist
Following the completion of field work, herbarium research, and a digital querying of rare taxa reports within 2 miles of SCP (using the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program's MapViewer application ), a data-rich checklist of all the vascular flora collected or reported from savannas, flatwoods, or sandhill community types in SCP or the vicinity was prepared. (The checklist is available in spreadsheet format in Suppl. material .) Within the checklist, taxa are organized by major plant groups (i.e., Pteridophytes; Gymnosperms; Monocotyledons; Basal Angiosperms, Magnoliids, and Eudicotyledons), then alphabetically by family, genus, and species. Each taxon is accompanied by a brief entry that contains the following three sections:

Conservation Status: For rare taxa (i.e., those listed by ), status and rank designations are provided in the following order: states status, federal status; state rank, global rank. The following abbreviations are used: STATE STATUS: E = Endangered; T = Threatened; SC = Special Concern: -V = Vulnerable, -H = Historical; SR = Significantly Rare: -L = Limited to North Carolina and adjacent states (endemic/near endemic), -T = Throughout, -P = Periphery of Range, -O = Other; W = Watch List: W1 = rare but relatively secure, W2 = rare but taxonomically questionable, W5B = exploited plants, W7 = rare and poorly known. FEDERAL STATUS: E = Endangered; FSC = Federal Species of Concern. STATE RANK: SH = historical (known only from historical populations); S1 = Critically imperiled, 1–5 populations in state; S2 = Imperiled, 6–20 populations in state; S3 = Vulnerable, 21–100 populations in state; S4 = Apparently secure, 101–1000 populations in state; S5 = Secure, 1001+ populations in state. GLOBAL RANK: G1 = Critically imperiled, 1–5 populations in world; G2 = Imperiled, 6–20 populations in world; G3 = Vulnerable, 21–100 populations in world; G4 = Apparently secure, 101–1000 populations in world; G5 = Secure, 1001+ populations in world; T# = Global rank of a subspecies or variety; Q = Questionable taxonomy; ? = Uncertain. (For a synopsis of all taxa of conservation concern treated in this work, see Tables , .)

Distribution: The distribution of taxa is provided by listing the community types in which the taxa have been collected or reported within the study area. For taxa collected or reported from SCP, the community types (sensu ) in which the taxa occur on site are listed from driest to wettest (i.e., in order of increasing soil moisture) and are abbreviated as follows (see Table ): PSOS-MT = Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype); MPS-CP = Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain subtype); WPF-T = Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype); SPS-T = Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype); SPS-RF = Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush Featherling subtype); WLPS = Wet Loamy Pine Savanna; VWLPS = Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna. For taxa not collected or reported from SCP but collected in the vicinity by  or reported from the vicinity by  or , community types as provided by those authors are given. For all other taxa (i.e., those taxa collected or reported from the vicinity by sources other than the afoermentioned), habitat according to  is provided in lieu of community types.

Notes: Within each "notes" section, several bits of information are provided in the following order: 1) an estimate of abundance adadpted from  (see Table ) for taxa collected by the senior author in SCP; 2) flowering and fruiting phenology from  and supplemented, in some cases, with personal observation; 3) voucher information from specimens deposited in the following herbaria: DUKE, NCSC, NCU, and WNC. Within a list of vouchers, specimens collected in SCP are listed first, followed by specimens collected from the vicinity, which are arranged alphabetically by site name, then by tract name (if within Sandy Run), and finally by collector last name. For taxa of conservation concern that were collected in Sandy Run, the name of the tract in which the voucher was collected is purposefully omitted; and 4) in brackets, synonymy with , the Flora of North America Project, and .

Six taxa included in this guide bear numeric "placeholder" epithets, as currently listed in . Of these six taxa, the following four are presumed to be new to science: Allium species 1, Coreopsis species 1, Scleria species 1, and Xyris species 1. The remaining two taxa–Dichanthelium species 3 and Dichanthelium species 12–were recognized by previous authors (see synonymy for those taxa in the checklist); however, the appropriate combination has yet to be made within Dichanthelium.Based on field observations by the senior author, instances of known hybridization appear to be rare in the flora. (Actual hybridization events may be more common but are beyond the scope of this research.) One notable exception, however, is Sarracenia
×
catesabaei Elliott (= Sarracenia
flava L. × Sarracenia
purpurea L.). (See the key to Sarracenia for a discussion of hybridization within that genus.) Hybrids are nottreated as separate taxa in this guide.

Identification Keys
Dichotomous keys were created to all taxa collected or reported from savannas, flatwoods, or sandhill community types in SCP and the vicinity (i.e., in areas within two miles of SCP, including all tracts within Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area). The order of the keys follows that of the checklist (i.e., a key is first provided to four main vascular plant groups, then within each of these groups, keys proceed alphabetically by family and then genus). In addition, three “auxiliary keys” are provided: a vegetative key to common savanna bunchgrasses (following the key to genera of Poaceae); a key to herbaceous eudicotyledonous taxa with simple, opposite, more-or-less ovate leaves (following the key to families of basal angiosperms, magnoliids, and eudicotyledons); and a vegetative key to frequently confused ericaceous subshrubs (following the key to genera of Ericaceae). Keys were adapted from , the cited Flora of North America treatments, , and personal notes. In the keys exceptional values for numeric character ranges are indicated in parentheses (e.g., leaf blade 1–2(–4) cm wide). Definitions, explanatory notes, and exceptional non-numeric character states are also placed in parentheses (e.g., corolla pink (rarely white)).

During herbarium searches, vouchers of taxa collected by others in SCP or in the vicinity but not collected by the senior author in SCP were carefully examined. In five cases the senior author disagreed with the determinations of such vouchers. Nevertheless, since the original determinations were always of taxa whose habitat and distribution make them plausible components of the flora, these taxa were included in the keys, where indicated by a plus (+) symbol. These taxa are not, however, formally treated in this work (i.e., they do not appear in the checklist) and are not included in summary statistics. Additionally, forty-four taxa that are not known from the habitats treated in this work but that often occur in roadsides or other disturbed areas immediately adjacent to such habitats, are also included in the keys, where indicated by a double-dagger (‡) symbol. These taxa, too, are neither formally treated in this work nor included in the summary statistics. Finally, though only one exotic taxon is reported in this work, several of the forty-four aforementioned taxa (those strictly of roadsides or disturbed areas) are exotic (i.e., not native to the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, sensu ). Exotic taxa are indicated in the keys with an asterisk (*).

Data resources
Dichotomous keys were adapted from , the cited Flora of North America treatments, , and personal notes. Taxonomic concepts and nomenclature usually follow  but in some cases follow the cited Flora of North America treatments. Status and ranks for taxa of conservation concern (i.e., those taxa listed by ) were adopted from ; see Tables , ). Plant community types were identified using . Line drawings were obtained from the following public domain works: , , . All photographs, with the exception of those for Carya
tomentosa, were taken by Robert Thornhill.

Notes
Mid Jun–Aug; Aug–Oct. The specimen for this report (Thornhill 1547, NCSC), which was collected by the author at the edge of a dirt road and powerline savanna in Shaken Creek Preserve, has calyx lobes somewhat shorter and leaves somewhat narrower than is typical for Pycnanthemum
setosum. However, based on comparisons to specimens at NCSC and NCU and following the advice of better botanists (in particular, Derrick Poindexter (NCU)), the specimen seems at least to align most closely with Pycnanthemum
setosum. More study is needed to clarify the taxonomy of this genus. Pycnanthemum
setosum is also reported within a 2-mile radius of Shaken Creek Preserve by the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program () (EO status “current”, accuracy “medium”), though no vouchers for this report have been seen by the senior author. [= RAB, Weakley]

Note: Understanding some basic terminology is critical to the successful use of the following keys to Pteridophytes families, genera, and species. Pinnate indicates lobing (usually of leaves or leaf segments) entirely to the midrib, whereas pinnatifid indicates lobing to near the midrib. Pinnate-pinnatifid refers to a leaf that is once-pinnate and whose segments (pinnae) are themselves pinnatifid. The spore-producing structures of many ferns are borne in masses called sori, which may be either exposed or covered by the margin of the leaves (a false indusium) or a separate structure (a true indusium). Leaf-like structures that bear sporangia are called sporophylls; these may be similar to the sterile leaves or may be highly modified (e.g., the compacted, cone-like structures, or strobili, of Lycopodiaceae).

[Blechnaceae]
Woodwardia Sm.

1	Leaves mostly vertically ascending, appressed and overlapping, spirally arranged; branchlets ascending from twigs, secundly erect; bark 1–2.5 cm thick, furrowed, dark-brown, not exfoliating; larger knees short, rarely &gt; 4 dm tall, with thick, compact bark on top; trees of isolated depressions, wet savannas, pocosins, other wet peaty habitats, and, less commonly, blackwater swamps	
Taxodium
ascendens
	
–	Leaves pendent to horizontally spreading to laterally divergent, spirally arranged but generally appearing distichous (“featherlike”); bark &lt; 1 cm thick, exfoliating in shreddy, orange-brown strips; larger knees often tall, frequently &gt; 4 dm tall, with thin, shreddy bark on top; trees of blackwater swamps (and other habitats outside of SCP, including brownwater swamps, natural lakes, and millponds)	Taxodium
distichum‡	
Key adapted from , .

Note: Taxodium
distichum (L.) Rich. has not been found in savannas or flatwoods on site, though it has been seen in swamps. Nevertheless, it is included in the key below (where indicated by a double-dagger symbol, ‡) to facilitate the distinguishing of it from Taxodium
ascendens Brongn., an occasional component of the wettest savannas. In the following key leaf and branchlet characters of Taxodium
ascendens refer to mature trees; foliage of juvenile trees often mimics that of Taxodium
distichum. Leaf and branchlet characters of Taxodium
distichum refer to both mature and juvenile trees; however, in the crowns of mature Taxodium
distichum, leaf and branchlet characters sometimes mimic those of Taxodium
ascendens. For these reasons, accurate identification of the two species often requires observation of other, non-foliage features, including the stature of the “knees”, the thickness and texture of the bark, and the habitat in which the plant grows.

Note: Cyperus appears to be at most only a minor component of the savanna and flatwood flora in Shaken Creek Preserve and in the vicinity. At Shaken Creek Preserve, no Cyperus species have been outside of disturbed areas; of the nine Cyperus species reported from Sandy Run by , only one, Cyperus
haspan L., was reported from pine savannas or flatwoods. Nevertheless, a few Cyperus species could be found in savannas or flatwoods, and the following key attempts to accommodate such discovery. Included in the key below are those species seen by the senior author growing in disturbed areas near savannas or flatwoods in Shaken Creek Preserve and also those species reported by  as growing in disturbed areas but whose habitat description in  includes savannas and/or flatwoods.

NOTE: The inflorescence of Sisyrinchium is comprised of 1–11(–15), usually pedicellate flowers (and their tiny, hyaline bracteoles) that emerge from within two green or purplish-tinged “spathes.” Inflorescences and associated spathes occur singly at the tips of branch-like peduncles in most species but are characteristically paired at the stem apex in Sassafras
albidum and Sisyrinchium
capillare. In these latter two species, one of the two inflorescences is often concealed by a large, erect, leaf-bract, which may give the false impression that only one inflorescence is present.

Several unusual Sisyrinchium specimens were collected in Sandy Run [Neck] by Wilbur, who determined the specimens to be Sisyrinchium
arenicola, a taxon listed by  as occurring from MD northward. The specimens have the following features, all of which agree with Sisyrinchium
arenicola: stems 2.7–3.4 mm wide, leaf bases persistent in fibrous tufts, outer spathe bracts 12–21 mm long, and capsules 3.2–4.1 mm long. Pending further review, these specimens are here treated as Sisyrinchium
arenicola, despite the geographic anomaly. Sisyrinchium
rosulatum E.P. Bicknell has not been found in pertinent habitats in Shaken Creek Preserve or the vicinity; however, the species has been collected along roadsides very near savannas and flatwoods and is, for convenience, included in the key below, where indicated by a double dagger symbol (‡).

Note: The complex inflorescences of Andropogon necessitate the use of specialized terminology in botanical keys. In Andropogon (and Schizachyrium) paired spikelets create V-shaped dispersal units consisting of the following parts: the sessile spikelet at base; the pedicellate spikelet (usually vestigial or absent) at the summit of the pedicel, which forms one arm of the “V”; and the rachis internode (lacking a spikelet at summit), which forms the other arm of the “V.” (In the key below, spikelet measurements do not include lengths of awns, when present.) Several V-shaped dispersal units are aggregated one on top of the other to create a raceme (or “rame”). Several racemes are digitately aggregated at the apex of a peduncle and enclosed at least partially by a leaf-like raceme sheath. The racemes, peduncle, and subtending raceme sheath collectively form the inflorescence unit.

Andropogon
capillipes Nash (sensu ), of dry to mesic pine flatwoods and sandhills, was reported from Sandy Run by  (as “Andropogon
capillipes Nash var. 2”). However, the voucher for this taxon (Taggart SARU 647, WNC) appears to the senior author to be Andropogon
dealbatus (C. Mohr ex Hack.) Weakley &amp; LeBlond (sensu ) based on the pubescence of the inflorescence branchlets subtending the raceme sheaths and the lengths of the raceme sheaths. Though not otherwise reported or collected in Shaken Creek Preserve or the vicinity, Andropogon
capillipes may occur in the area and is therefore maintained in the key below, where indicated by a plus (+) symbol.

Note/Disclaimer: Keying specimens of Dichanthelium can be a painstaking, revision-filled process involving the interpretation of challenging characters and the repeated measurements of minute structures; positive identification is sometimes elusive. Nonetheless, with careful effort and practice, most specimens can be successfully identified. Several words of clarification, largely borrowed from , are warranted regarding the key below. First, spikelet measurements refer only to mature spikelets, recognizable by their firm, plump, usually whitish fertile lemmas; immature spikelets are typically longer than mature spikelets and are not accounted for in the key. When measuring spikelet length, measure from the point of attachment of the lower glume to the apex of the highest spikelet structure (usually either the upper glume or the fertile lemma). Pubescence, an oft-used character in distinguishing Dichanthelium taxa, must also be evaluated carefully. When assessing internode pubescence, ignore the basalmost internode, which is generally shortened and uncharacteristic, and examine the first few elongated internodes. Nodes that are referred to as “bearded” have hairs that are longer, often denser, and of either a different structure or orientation than the hairs of the internodes and sheaths. Ligules are also an important diagnostic feature in Dichanthelium. When attempting to identify a specimen, examine several ligules, as the length and structure of ligules can vary within individuals. (For a more comprehensive overview of best practices in identifying Dichanthelium taxa, see the introduction to Dichanthelium in .)

angustifolius Elliott (SR-P; S1, G4?Q) has not been reported from or collected in Shaken Creek Preserve or the vicinity; however, the species could be found in open, wet areas on site, as around the margins of borrow ponds or ditches. Moreover, one specimen collected from Sandy Run and reported as Lycopus

Analysis
Floristic Summary
The flora of the savannas, flatwoods, and sandhills of SCP proper, based on vouchered specimens and reports (i.e., ), consists of 450 taxa (i.e., species, subspecies, or varieties) in 204 genera and eighty-three families (Table ). Of these 450 taxa, 432 (96%) are vouchered; eighteen (4%) are known only from reports. Thirty-two taxa (7.1%) are listed as Significantly Rare (Table ), and thirty-eight (8.4%) are on the NCNHP Watch List (Table ). Three species are federally endangered (Carex
lutea, Lysimachia
asperulifolia, and Thalictrum
cooleyi), and six are Federal Species of Concern (Allium species 1, Amorpha
georgiana, Dionaea
muscipula, Parnassia
caroliniana Michx., Rhynchospora
decurrens Chapm., and Rhynchospora
thornei Kral).

An additional 102 taxa in twenty-seven genera and seven families were collected or reported from savannas or flatwoods in the vicinity of SCP (i.e., within two miles of SCP, including Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area; Table ). Of these 102 additional taxa, seventy-seven (75.5%) are vouchered; twenty-five (24.5%) are known only from reports. Eighteen taxa (17.6%) are listed as Significantly Rare (Table ), and seven (6.9%) are on the NCNHP Watch List (Table ). Four taxa are Federal Species of Concern (Plantago
sparsiflora Michx., Scleria species 1, Trillium
pusillum
Michx.
var.
pusillum, and Xyris
scabrifolia R.M. Harper).

In total, 552 taxa in 231 genera and ninety families are treated in this guide (Table ). Seventy-seven taxa (13.9%) were collected or reported only from SCP; 102 taxa (18.5%) were collected or reported only from the vicinity of SCP; and 373 taxa (67.6%) were collected or reported from both SCP and the vicinity (Fig. ). Of the 552 total taxa, 514 (93.1%) are vouchered; thirty-eight (6.9%) are known only from reports. Fifty taxa (9.1%) are listed as Significantly Rare (Table ), and forty-five (8.2%) are on the NCNHP Watch List (Table ). Three taxa are federally endangered, and ten are Federal Species of Concern.

Among all taxa treated in this guide, the eudicotyledons are the most species-rich group, containing 290 taxa; the monocotyledons are a close second, containing 242 taxa. The richest families among eudicotyledons are Asteraceae (68 taxa), Fabaceae (24 taxa), Ericaceae (18 taxa), Hypericaceae (15 taxa), Apiaceae (10 taxa), and Gentianaceae (10 taxa; Fig. ). The richest genera among eudicotyledons are Hypericum L. (15 taxa), Quercus L. (9 taxa), Eupatorium L. (8 taxa), Agalinis Raf. (7 taxa), Polygala L. (7 taxa), Solidago L. (7 taxa), and Viola L. (7 taxa; Fig. ). The richest families among monocotyledons are Poaceae (81 taxa), Cyperaceae (72 taxa), Juncaceae (18 taxa), Orchidaceae (18 taxa), and Xyridaceae (12 taxa; Fig. ). The richest genera among monocotyledons are Rhynchospora Vahl (35 taxa), Dichanthelium (Hitchc. &amp; Chase) Gould (26 taxa), Juncus L. (18 taxa), Xyris L. (12 taxa), Andropogon L. (10 taxa), and Scleria P.J. Bergius (10 taxa; Fig. ).

Among all taxa treated in this guide, the most species-rich habit is herbs (447 taxa), followed by trees and shrubs (83 taxa), and vines (22 taxa). Among the herbs, Poaceae (81 taxa), Cyperaceae (72 taxa), and Asteraceae (66 taxa) are the richest families, followed by Fabaceae (18 taxa), Juncaceae (18 taxa), and Orchidaceae (18 taxa). The richest family of trees and shrubs is Ericaceae (18 taxa), followed by Fagaceae (9 taxa), Hypericaceae (8 taxa), Rosaceae (7 taxa), Aquifoliaceae (4 taxa), and Pinaceae (4 taxa). The richest families of vines are Smilacaceae (5 taxa) and Fabaceae (4 taxa), followed by Bignoniaceae (2 taxa), Convolvulaceae (2 taxa), and Vitaceae (2 taxa; Fig. , , ).

Among the community types included in this work, the most species-rich is Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna; the least species-rich is Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype; Fig. ).

Only one exotic taxon, Pinus
elliottii
Engelm.
var.
elliottii, which was planted by a timber company in a flatwoods in SCP prior to the site’s purchase by The Nature Conservancy, was collected or reported from pertinent habitats in the study area.

One species, Aletris
lutea Small, is here reported as a state record; another taxon, Panicum
dichotomiflorum
Michx.
var.
puritanorum Svenson, is reported as a Pender County record.

Robert ThornhillAcknowledgements
I would first like to thank my advisor, Dr. Alexander Krings, for his patience, attention to detail, and tireless dedication throughout this project, manifested perhaps most conspicuously in his willingness to comb repeatedly through the minutia of drafts of this lengthy manuscript in search of even the smallest typographical errors, of which there were (but hopefully are not now) plenty. I am also grateful to the other members of my committee: Dr. Jon Stucky, who introduced me to Shaken Creek Preserve and helped unveil to me the mysteries of graminoids, and to Dr. David Lindbo, whose humor and perspective have been a tremendous asset.

Botanists who have assisted me in plant identification or in related pursuits during this project include Dr. A.J. Bullard, Ed Corey, David McAdoo, Derick Poindexter, Bruce Sorrie, Dale Suiter, Mike Turner, Dr. Wade Wall, Dr. Alan Weakley, and Donna Wright. Dr. Alexander Krings and Dr. Jon Stucky reviewed my voucher specimens and provided critical feedback. Richard LeBlond assisted me in numerous ways, not the least of which was reviewing all of my Dichanthelium specimens—a favor that can be fully appreciated only by those who have ever tried to key out a Dichanthelium! Dr. John Taggart furnished excellent information regarding the flora of Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area; he also provided much-appreciated encouragement and advice throughout this project. Dr. Layne Huiet at Duke University, CarolAnn McCormick at UNC Chapel Hill, and Dr. Eric Schuettpelz at UNC Wilmington provided cheerful curatorial assistance at their respective herbaria.

Special thanks to Josh Justice, Robert Swinson, and all the members of the Wallace Deer Club, who graciously allowed me to sleep and take cold showers in their lodge. (An extra-special thanks to that anonymous hunting club member who eventually showed me the circuit breaker for the hot-water heater.) I also thank the NC Plant Conservation Program, the NC Natural Heritage Program, and The Nature Conservancy, who enabled and supported this research in various ways. In particular, I would like to thank Hervey McIver for his enthusiastic stewardship of Shaken Creek Preserve–and for his optimistic and adventuresome spirit. Twenty years from now, I hope I, too, am crashing through overgrown savannas exclaiming of their restoration potential: “With just a few good burns….”

Thank you to the past and present members of the NC State floristics group: Rachel Clark, Kelly Hines, and Amanda Saville, for paving the way; and Lee Kimmel, Casie Reed, and Jenny Stanley, for your encouragement and collective goofiness. Thank you also to the past and present office staff of the NCSU Plant Biology Department: Carol Apperson, Christine Brown, Vicki Lemaster, and, especially, Sue Vitello. Without you, I certainly would not have made it this far–and, worse, I would probably still be filling out travel authorization forms incorrectly.

I am deeply indebted to the NC Native Plant Society, the NC Academy of Science, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service for funding this project. Because of these groups, my use of “indebted” is still mostly metaphorical…mostly.

Finally, to my family: Mr. Andy and Ms. Dottie, thank you for letting me repeatedly convert your dining room into a floristics laboratory; Mom and Dad, you are amazing people and wonderful parents, as evinced by the fact that your son studies plants—and you love him anyway; Bro, let’s puzzle over laurel and willow oaks again soon; and Audrey, my sweet wife, who may never get to enjoy a walk through the woods with an undistracted husband, thank you for your patience and love.

The highest-quality examples of the other communities on site are also shown; however, fire-suppressed examples of some of these community types occur throughout the property and are not mapped. In the legend community types (sensu ) are arranged from driest to wettest (i.e., in order of increasing soil moisture). Areas in which two community types intergrade or co-occur in a mosaic are indicated by including the abbreviations of both community types, separated by a forward slash (e.g., MPS-CP/WPF-T). PL = powerline right-of-way; PSOS-MT = Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype); MPS-CP = Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain subtype); WPF-T = Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype); SPS-T = Sandy Pine Savannas (Typic subtype); SPS-RF = Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush Featherling subtype); WLPS = Wet Loamy Pine Savanna; VWLPS = Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna.

Variations in fire intensity based on vegetation type.

In savannas that are frequently burned and lack significant woody vegetation, fires are small enough to be stepped over harmlessly (photo by R. Thornhill).

Fire intensity increases along the woody margins of savannas and flatwoods (photo by R. Thornhill).

Fire time-series in a Wet Loamy Pine Savanna community type. Many savanna species, particularly bunchgrasses, flower only following growing-season fires. This sequence of photos shows the effects of fire on the flowering of Ctenium
aromaticum (toothache grass).

April 30, two days after a burn (photo by R. Thornhill).

June 27, just less than two months after a burn. Notice the profusion of flowering stalks of Ctenium
aromaticum in the burned area (left) versus their near-absence in the unburned (right) area (photo by R. Thornhill).

Two community types not formally treated in this thesis: Pocosin and Pond Pine Woodland. The overall species composition of these community types is very similar to (albeit less rich) than the flatwoods and savanna community types formally treated in this work. Indeed, virtually all species in pocosins and pond pine woodlands are also found in flatwoods and/or savannas; consequently, this guide will facilitate the identification of species in pocosins and pond pine woodlands as well as in flatwoods and savannas.

Pocosin: note the dense growth of low (mostly evergreen) shrubs and the absence of tall trees (photo by R. Thornhill).

Pone Pine Woodland: note the dense stand of Pinus
serotina (Pond pine) that characterizes this community (photo by R. Thornhill).

Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype)

A typical wet pine flatwoods (photo by R. Thornhill).

When frequently burned, the physiognomy of wet pine flatwoods resembles that of Pine Savannas; however, species diversity and overall richness, especially at a small scale, is lower in in this community type than in true savannas (photo by R. Thornhill).

Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush Featherling subtype)

A super-abundance of the white-flowered Pleea
tenuifolia (Rush featherling) characterizes this community type (photos by R. Thornhill).

Two Loamy Pine Savanna community types

This Wet Loamy Pine Savanna, treeless and dominated by the charismatic Sarracenia flava (yellow pitcher plant), is one of the most stunning vistas in Shaken Creek Preserve – or perhaps anywhere (photo by R. Thornhill)!

Very Wet Loamy Pine Savannas harbor a suite of exceptionally rare species, often found in slight depressions, like the narrow one running from left to right in this photograph (photo by R. Thornhill).

Distribution of taxa by habit and community type in the savannas and flatwoods in Shaken Creek Preserve ("SCP") and vicinity (i.e., within two mile of Shaken Creek Preserve, including Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area; “SR+V”). “Taxa” includes species, subspecies, and varieties. Values include taxa vouchered or known only from reports. Suppl. material 

Taxonomic distribution of herbaceous taxa. Families represented by ≥ 8 herbaceous taxa in either Shaken Creek Preserve or in the vicinity are represented individually; families represented by &lt; 8 herbaceous taxa in both Shaken Creek Preserve and in the vicinity are subsumed in the “Other families” category.

Taxonomic distribution of tree and shrub taxa. Families represented by ≥ 2 tree or shrub taxa in either Shaken Creek Preserve or in the vicinity are represented individually; families represented by only 1 tree or shrub taxon in both Shaken Creek Preserve and in the vicinity comprise the “Other families” category.

Taxonomic distribution of vines (herbaceous or woody plants that climb by means of holdfasts or by twining). All families containing vine taxa are included.

Distribution by community type of taxa collected or reported from Shaken Creek Preserve. Values above columns indicate the total number of taxa (i.e., rare and non-rare) collected or reported from each community type. "Rare taxa” are those taxa listed by the NC Natural Heritage Program as Significantly Rare or Watch List (). Community types follow  and are arranged according to increasing soil moisture (i.e., from the driest to wettest community type). Abbreviations are as follows: PSOS-MT = Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition subtype); MPS-CP = Mesic Pine Savanna (Coastal Plain subtype); WPF-T = Wet Pine Flatwoods (Typic subtype); SPS-T = Sandy Pine Savanna (Typic subtype); SPS-RF = Sandy Pine Savanna (Rush Featherling subtype); WLPS = Wet Loamy Pine Savanna; VWLPS = Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna.

Suppl. material 

Comparison of the richest plant families present in the savannas, flatwoods, and sandhills in Shaken Creek Preserve (“SCP”), in the vicinity (i.e., within two mile of Shaken Creek Preserve, including Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area; “SR+V”), and in both Shaken Creek Preserve and the vicinity (“SCP and SR+V”). “Taxa” includes species, subspecies, and varieties. Families represented by ≥ 8 total taxa are represented individually; families represented by &lt; 8 total taxa are subsumed in the “Other families” category. Values appearing within or beside the columns indicate the total number of taxa from each indicated family; values appearing above each column indicate the total number of taxa across all familles. Values include taxa vouchered or known only from reports. Suppl. material 

Comparison of the richest genera in the savannas, flatwoods, and sandhills in Shaken Creek Preserve (“SCP”), in the vicinity (i.e., within two mile of Shaken Creek Preserve, including Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area; “SR+V”), and in both Shaken Creek Preserve and the vicinity (“SCP and SR+V”). “Taxa” includes species, subspecies, and varieties. Genera represented by ≥ 7 total taxa are represented individually; genera represented by &lt; 7 total taxa are not included. Values appearing within the columns indicate the total number of taxa from each included genus. Values appearing above each column indicate the total number of taxa across all included genera; percentages appearing above each column indicate the percentage of the flora of the particular area that is represented by the included genera.

Plant community types in Shaken Creek Preserve included in this work. Community types and their associated ranks follow . Community types are presented in order of increasing soil moisture – i.e., from driest community type (Pine/Scrub Oak Sandhill (Mesic Transition Subtype)) to wettest (Very Wet Loamy Pine Savanna).

S1 = Critically Imperiled, 1–5 occurrences in state; S2 = Imperiled, 6–20 occurrences in state; S3 = Vulnerable, 21–100 occurrences in state; G1 = Critically Imperiled, 1–5 occurrences in world; G2 = Imperiled, 6–20 occurrences in world; G3 = Vulnerable, 21–100 occurrences in world

List of rare taxa (i.e., "Significantly Rare" or rarer sensu ) collected or reported from savannas, flatwoods, or sandhills in Shaken Creek Preserve or the vicinity (i.e., within a 2-mile radius of Shaken Creek Preserve, including Sandy Run Savannas State Natural Area). Status and rank designations follow . Parentheses around a taxon indicate that the taxon is not known from Shaken Creek Preserve but is known from the vicinity. Taxa for which voucher specimens have been collected (by the senior author or others) are indicated with a "yes" in the second column. The taxonomy followed in this work and that of  differ in the following instances: 1)  do not report infraspecific taxa within Arnoglossum
ovatum (Walter) H. Rob.; therefore, the status and ranks listed in the table below for Arnoglossum
ovatum
var.
lanceolatum (Nutt.) D.B. Ward apply to the species, not just the variety (though var. Arnoglossumovatumlanceolatum is currently the only infraspecific taxon within Arnoglossum
ovatum reported for NC ()); 2) the recently named Coreopsis
palustris Sorrie is listed by  as Coreopsis
helianthoides Beadle; 3) Packera
paupercula (Michx.) Á. Löve &amp; D. Löve is listed by  as Packera
crawfordii (Britton) A.M. Mahoney &amp; R.R. Kowal (see the note in the Identification Key to Packera for a brief discussion regarding the taxonomy of this species and its treatment in this work). Finally, the infraspecific global rank given by  and reported here for Rhynchospora
pinetorum Britton &amp; Small is probably a reflection of the recognition of that taxon by many authors as Rhynchospora
globularis
(Chapman) Small
var.
pinetorum (Small) Gale.

Summary of vascular plant taxa collected or reported from savannas, flatwoods, or sandhills in Shaken Creek Preserve or the vicinity (i.e., in Sandy Run and/or within a 2-mile radius of Shaken Creek Preserve). The first number in each three-number series indicates the number of taxa collected or reported from Shaken Creek Preserve. The second number in each series indicates the number of additional taxa collected or reported from the vicinity of, but not in, Shaken Creek Preserve. The third number in each series, which appears in parentheses, is the sum of the preceding two numbers and indicates the total number of taxa collected or reported from either Shaken Creek Preserve or the vicinity. (The lone exotic taxon is Pinus
elliottii
Engelm.
var.
elliottii, which was planted by a timber company in a flatwoods in Shaken Creek Preserve prior to the site’s purchase by The Nature Conservancy.)
