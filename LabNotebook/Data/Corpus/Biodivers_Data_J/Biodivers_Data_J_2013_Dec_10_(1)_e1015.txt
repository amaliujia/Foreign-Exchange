Introduction
The knowledge on the diversity of the reptile fauna of Laos has strikingly increased during the recent decades.  provided the first checklist of 109 reptile species from Laos.  published an updated checklist of reptiles from southern Laos with a total of 89 recorgnized species. Four years later,  recorded 13 additional species of colubrid and viperid snakes from the country. The species number of reptiles from Laos was 180 in 2010 (). Since 2010, six new species of reptiles have been described from Laos comprising Cyrtodactylus
wayakonei Nguyen, Kingsada, Rösler, Auer &amp; Ziegler, 2010, Cyrtodactylus
lomyenensis Ngo &amp; Pauwels, 2010, Cyrtodactylus
teyniei David, Nguyen, Schneider &amp; Ziegler, 2011, Cyrtodactylus
pageli Schneider, Nguyen, Schmitz, Kingsada, Auer &amp; Ziegler, 2011, Lycodon
davidi Vogel, Nguyen, Kingsada &amp; Ziegler, 2012, and Oligodon
nagao David, Nguyen, Nguyen, Jiang, Chen, Teynié &amp; Ziegler, 2012 (, , , , , ). In 2012 and 2013, additional field surveys were conducted in the hill evergreen forest within Xe Sap National Protected Area, Salavan Province, and limestone forests within Hin Nam No National Protected Area, Khammouane Province. Examination of voucher specimens from aforementioned sites revealed the existence of a number of reptile species that have not been known from Laos so far. We herein report four new records of reptiles from the country, comprising two species of Gekkonidae, and one species and one subspecies of Colubridae.

Materials and methods
Field surveys were conducted by T. Calame in Xe Sap National Protected Area (NPA), Salavan Province in May 2012 and by V. Q. Luu in Hin Nam No NPA, Khammouane Province from April to July 2013 (Figs , ). Specimens were collected by hand or snake hook between 19:00-23:00. After taking photographs, specimens were anaesthetized, fixed in 80-85% ethanol and subsequently stored in 70% ethanol. Voucher specimens are deposited in the collections of the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (IEBR), Hanoi, Vietnam; the National University of Laos (NUOL), Vientiane, Laos; the Vietnam Forestry University (VFU), Hanoi, Vietnam; and the Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (ZFMK), Bonn, Germany.

Measurements of specimens were taken with a digital caliper to the nearest 0.1 mm. Abbreviation are as follows: SVL (snout-vent length): from tip of snout to anterior margin of cloaca; TaL (Tail length): from posterior margin of cloaca to tip of tail; TL (total length): SVL+TaL. Terminology of morphological characters follows  for lizards and  for snakes. Bilateral scale counts were given as left/right.

Specimen examined (n = 1). VFU A.2013.5, adult male, collected by V. Q. Luu on 14 May 2013 from Pa Rang region, Noong Ma Commune, Boualapha District, Khammouane Province (17°17.648’N, 106°10.053’E, elevation 556 m a.s.l.), within Hin Nam No NPA.

Morphological characters. Total length (TL) 665 mm (SVL 520 mm, TaL 145 mm); body elongate; head moderately distinct from neck, rather flattened; snout projecting anteriorly beyond lower jaw; pupil vertically oval; tail tapered and thin; maxillary teeth 12/12; snout scale broad; rostral distinctly broader than high, partly visible from above; internasals large, pentagonal, not in contact with loreal; prefrontal more than half length of internasal, subrectangular, wider than long, not entering orbit; frontal hexagonal, narrowed posteriorly; parietals longer than wide; nasal paired; loreal 1/1, small, pentagonal, not bordering the eye; supralabials 8/8, third to fifth in contact with the eye, sixth largest; infralabials 10/10, first to fifth bordering chin shields; preocular 1/1; postoculars 2/2, bordering anterior temporal; anterior temporals 2/2; posterior temporals 3/3; dorsal scale rows 17-17-15; five middorsal scales keeled, the outer rows usually smooth; ventrals 224; subcaudals 96, paired; cloacal single.

Ecology
The specimen of Lycodon
ruhstrati
abditus was found at 11:00 while moving through a forest path. The surrounding habitat was karst forest at the elevation of 556 m a.s.l.

Distribution
Lycodon
ruhstrati has been known from Taiwan, China and northern Vietnam: Lycodon
ruhstrati
ruhstrati is endemic to Taiwan and the range of Lycodon
ruhstrati
abditus is widespread in the mainland of China and Vietnam (see ). Our finding represents the first record of the species as well as the subspecies, Lycodon
ruhstrati
abditus, from Laos and it is approximately about 20 km far from the type locality of the subspecies in Phong Nha - Ke Bang National Park, Quang Binh Province, Vietnam.

Notes
The specimen from Laos differs from the description of  in having fewer cross-bands on the body (17 versus 19-43).

Discussion
The recent discoveries of Cyrtodactylus
phongnhakebangensis and Cyrtodactylus
pseudoquadrivirgatus in Laos bring the species number of the genus Cyrtodactylus known from that country to ten. This is still a low number compared with the Cyrtodactylus diversity from neighbouring Vietnam (which currently comprises 29 species, see ). In central Vietnam’s Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park two other bent-toed geckos, Cyrtodactylus
cryptus Heidrich, Rösler, Vu, Böhme &amp; Ziegler, 2007 () and Cyrtodactylus
roesleri Ziegler, Nazarov, Orlov, Nguyen, Vu, Dang, Dinh &amp; Schmitz, 2010 (), are known to occur sympatrically with Cyrtodactylus
phongnhakebangensis (). In Hin Nam No NPA, our observation also supports the finding of  about niche segregation of Cyrtodactylus species. Both Cyrtodactylus
roesleri and Cyrtodactylus
phongnhakebangensis were found on karst cliffs in the same habitat (Fig. ). In Laos, Cyrtodactylus
roesleri was previously recorded from Phou Hin Boun in Khammouane Province by . This is the first record of the species from Hin Nam No NPA. The new records of Lycodon
futsingensis, and Lycodon
ruhstrati
abditus from Khammouane Province increase the species number of snakes in Laos to 107. However, the diversity of reptiles in Laos is still poorly studied, particular in Hin Nam No NPA. In the bordering Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park in Vietnam,  recently provided a list of 101 reptile species including 15 new species and one new subspecies that have been described only from this site since 2000. Therefore, further field research is required to explore the actual herpetofaunal diversity of the largest karst formation in central Laos.
