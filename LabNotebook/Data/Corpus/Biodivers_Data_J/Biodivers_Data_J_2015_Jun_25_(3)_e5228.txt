Introduction
With over 52000 species globally, nematocerans or lower Diptera are one of the most species-rich insect groups in the world (). Within Nematocera, the most successful terrestrial group is the Bibionomorpha, including a majority of the saproxylic, fungivorous and herbivorous species (e.g. Mycetophilidae and Cecidomyiidae, ). As in many other biotic groups, Fennoscandian or North European bibionomorphans are perhaps the best known on the globe, especially regarding fungus gnats (or Sciaroidea, excluding Sciaridae). Despite the taxonomic and faunistic tradition starting from the 18th century (see ​), species are continually added to the Nordic list (, ), including species new to science (e.g. , , ). No less than 915 fungus gnat species are currently known from the Nordic countries and Russian parts of Fennoscandia (Karelia and Murmansk oblast), consisting of approximately 83 % of the total European fungus gnat fauna (). Nevertheless, at least 100 Fennoscandian fungus gnat species await formal naming and description (Kjaerandsen J., Polevoi A., Søli G., Salmela J., in prep.), raising the total number of species occurring in the area to around 1000. Non-herbivorous, or fungivorous and saproxylic gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) are far more poorly known than fungus gnats. In their recent monographs on the Nordic fauna, Mathias and Catrin Jaschhof (, ) have described dozens of new species and have much advanced the faunistic knowledge on Lestremiinae and Porricondylinae. For example, the number of Finnish Cecidomyiidae have increased from 136 () to 356 (), mainly due to taxonomic and faunistic work performed during the last ten years. However, both Lestremiinae and Porricondylinae should still be considered as poorly known groups, and further additions to the Nordic and Finnish lists are expected.

A list of Finnish Diptera was recently published (). In the present paper, 12 species was added to this list (3 Cecidomyiidae, 1 Keroplatidae, 8 Mycetophilidae) and the occurrence of one keroplatid species that was erroneously deleted from the Finnish list was confirmed. Thus, the number of Finnish fungus gnats and gall midges now totals 772 and 359 species, respectively.

Materials and methods
All material reported here was collected from Finnish Lapland (Fig. ). Lapland is an administrative area, covering a land area of ca. 100k km2. The SW corner of the area, close to the Baltic Sea, is middle boreal. The central part of Lapland is north boreal: coniferous forests prevail in the landscape, but there are isolated tree-less fells. Northernmost Lapland is an oroarctic area, sometimes called subalpine ecoregion. Fells and mountain birch forests prevail; isolated pine forests occur in some river valleys. The length of the thermal growing season (i.e. the number of days with the average temperature greater than + 5 C degrees after snow melt) is ca. 140-150 days in the middle boreal and ca. 105-110 days in the subalpine ecoregion (http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/terminen-kasvukausi, website accessed28.4.2015).

All material is deposited in the private collection of Jukka Salmela, Rovaniemi (JES). All specimens are stored in 70 % ethanol, kept in 2 ml plastic vials with screw cap and a rubber o-ring seal. Hypopygia of some specimens are kept in separate 0,5 ml microvials in glycerol.

Layer photos were taken using an Olympus E520 digital camera, attached to an Olympus SZX16 stereomicroscope. Digital photos were captured using the programmes Deep Focus 3.1 and Quick PHOTO CAMERA 2.3. Extended depth of focus images were reconstructed in the program Combine ZP.

Distribution
European. The species (Fig. ) was described from Sweden, (Tyresta) as Gongromastix
incerta (), and was later transferred to a monotypic genus Eomastix (). The species is known from Norway and Sweden, from a single site in both countries (). The Finnish locality is in Urho Kekkonen National Park, in the north boreal zone, close to the Russian border.

Ecology
Larvae of Lestreminae are perhaps mostly saproxylic (). The species is most likely to be pyrophilous, requiring or preferring forest fire areas. In Sweden, the species was collected from site that had experienced forest fire roughly one year earlier (). The Finnish collecting site is an old-growth burnt forest, dominated by pine (Pinus
sylvestris), with scattered spruce (Picea
abies) and birch (Betula sp). The forest fire site (Fig. ) is circa 34 ha in area, and the fire was ignited by lightning in late July 2013. The species seems to have rather long flying season, from June to August.

Distribution
European. The species (Fig. ) was described from France () and has been later recorded from Great Britain, Central and North Europe (, 
). The species seems to be rather rare throughout its range (, , ). In Sweden the species is very rare, known from the southern and central parts of the country, but it has probably vanished from four out of six of its previously occupied biogeographical provinces ().

Ecology
Immature stages are unknown, but Orfeliini larvae are predaceous (​). Asindulum
nigrum has been collected from calcareous wetlands (, ) and adult flies have often been observed visiting flowers, such as Apiaceae and Saxifraga
hirculus (). Finnish collecting site is a calcareous rich fen with iron-rich seepages (for a detailed description of the habitat, see ).

Conservation
The species is red-listed in Great Britain (NT, ) and Sweden (VU, ).

Distribution
European. The species (Fig. ​) was described from Russia, Kola peninsula (). Chandler () redescribed the species and reported it from the British Isles. Later Kjaerandsen et al. (​) verified the species from Iceland and discussed the distribution and taxonomy of the species. Although Kjaerandsen et al. had studied material collected from South Finland (Ab, Karislojo [Karjalohja]; Ka, Vehkalahti; N, Esbo [Espoo], Westend, six males in total), Jakovlev () deleted the species from the Finnish list, assuming that the species had not been found within post WWII borders of Finland. Here we confirm the occurrence of the species in Finland, and report eight new sites from Finnish Lapland. In Fennoscandia, M.
nigropicea is only known from Murmansk oblast and Finland.

Ecology
Immature stages are unknown, but Macrocera larvae are predaceous and mostly associated with soil and dead wood (see e.g. , ). Macrocera
nigropicea is perhaps associated with peatlands () or woodlands (​). Six out of eight sites reported here are aapamires, that is, minerogenous fens with wet flarks and dry bog-level strings. Two of the sites are open, dry meadows, but not situated far from either forest or peaty pond margins. Based on our observations, M.
nigropicea is perhaps not an obligate mire-dwelling species, but may prefer open habitats.

Later the species has been recorded from the Russian Far East (), France, Switzerland (​) and the Czech Republic (). New for the Fennoscandian fauna.

Ecology
Immature stages are unknown, but Sciophila larvae are fungivorous, living on the surfaces of agaric and polyporous fungi (), rarely on Pezizales (). Finnish locality (Fig. ​) is a iron-rich spring-fed brook on an ecotone between a pine mire and a luxuriant riparian forest.

Record from East Palaearctic (​) refers to Kola Peninsula, so it is not an additional area of distribution (P.J. Chandler, pers.comm.).

Ecology
Immature stages are unknown, but S.
fridolini is presumably a woodland species (). The Finnish collecting site is an alpine wetland along a headwater stream, characterized by Carex tussocks, Viola
biflora and sparse mountain birch forest.

Distribution
European. In his original description, Zaitzev () assigned S.
spinifera (Fig. ​) as a Finnish species, the holotype specimen was collected by Richard Frey from a place named "Opariornia". There is, however, no such place in Finland, and later the holotype was interpreted as a Swedish specimen, collected from Övertorneå (​, misspelled by Zaitzev), on the Swedish side of the River Tornio between Finland and Sweden. In addition to Sweden, the species is known from southern Norway () and Switzerland (​).

Ecology
Immature stages are unknown, but S.
spinifera is presumably a forest-dwelling species (). Finnish sampling sites are either old-growth, spruce-dominated moist forests (two sites) or a swampy birch forest.

European. A poorly known and rarely collected Fennoscandian species (Fig. ​). The species was described by Zaitzev (in ), based on a holotype male collected from Kivach Nature Reserve, Russian Karelia. Recently, the species was observed from Alta in northern Norway ().

Ecology
Immature stages are unknown, but Brevicornu larvae are most likely associated with microfungi in dead wood and soil litter (). The species is presumably a forest-dwelling fungus gnat; at least, the Norwegian sampling site was a mixed forest (). The Finnish locality is a swampy birch forest in the subalpine ecoregion.

Salmela; Event: samplingProtocol: Malaise trap; eventDate: 2013-8-7/9-19; habitat: spring brook, old-growth boreal forest; Record Level: institutionCode: JES

Distribution
European, so far reported only from Fennoscandia. The species (Fig. ​) was described from North Sweden (Abisko) (), and later findings are also from the northern part of the country (​). Only once recorded from North Norway, Alta (). Here reported from six sites in north boreal Finland.

Ecology
The species has been collected from both subalpine and boreal ecoregions, but detailed habitat descriptions are lacking in the literature. Finnish sampling sites are small lotic water bodies surrounded by old-growth boreal forests.

Taxon discussion
The original description of M.
haruspica is rather uninformative, barely sufficient for identification purposes (, fig. 8). Proper redescription of this species is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but the morphology of the male hypopygium is reviewed here. The ventral lobe of gonostylus (vl gst, Fig. ) has a conspicuous, helmet-like rounded lobe on dorsal margin and a small, hyaline spine next to it. Another prominent feature of vl gst is a long ventro-caudal spine, slightly bent beyond its mid-point (Fig. ). Dorsal lobe of gonostylus (dl gst, Fig. ) has a narrow, rounded lobe on the dorsal margin. The general shape of aedeagus is cordate, caudally tapering, apex incised and apical corners with a pair of narrow, hyaline lobes (Fig. ). 9th tergite is about as long as gonocoxite. Ventral margin of gonocoxites is undulating (Fig. ​). Based on the male hypopygium, the species is easy to separate from the other members of the vast genus Mycetophila.

Salmela; Event: samplingProtocol: Malaise trap; eventDate: 2013-5-24/6-28; habitat: headwater stream, deciduous herb-rich forest; Record Level: institutionCode: JES

Distribution
European. The species (Fig. , ​) was recently described from the Gemer region in the central part of Slovakia (). No other records are available. New for the Fennoscandian fauna.

Ecology
The holotype male was collected from a "spring area in a young spruce forest, 1230 m (above sea level)" ). Finnish locality is a herb-rich riparian forest, dominated by deciduous trees.

Taxon discussion
The species is quite close to M.
lastovkai Caspers, 1984 (Fig. , ​), a species that has been in the Nordic region reported from Sweden, Norway and Denmark (​). Nordic material of M.
lastovkai should be re-examined in order to check the potential confusion with M.
gemerensis.

Eomastix
incerta (Jaschhof) (Cecidomyiidae), male, DIPT-JS-2014-0492.

Forest fire site in Savukoski, Finnish Lapland, Urho Kekkonen National Park. Forest fire took place in 2013 and insect sampling (trunk-window traps) was performed in 2014. Two rare and poorly known ceciidomyiids, Eomastix
incerta (Jaschhof) and Lestremia
solidaginis (Felt), were caught. Both species are probably pyrophilous. Photo Jukka Salmela 6/2014.
