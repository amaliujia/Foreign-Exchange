Introduction
The genus Lasius Fabricius, 1804 is hithrto known to comprise 111 extant species and 3 subspecies (). In the Himalayas, 17 species have so far been reported, including 13 species from the Indian Himalaya (, ). A revision of Lasius was published by , where the author placed several species, i.e. Lasius
flavus (Fabricius, 1804), Lasius
nearcticus Wheeler, 1906 Lasius
alienoflavus Bingham, 1903, Lasius
talpa Wilson, 1955 and Lasius
fallax Wilson, 1955 forming the flavus-group in a distinct subgenus Cautolasius Wilson, 1955, and provided a key to the Palaearctic species.  revised the subgenus Lasius
sensu stricto from the Palaearctic, describing 17 new species, and updated Wilson's key to the Palaearctic species. Other significant contributions form the Palaearctic region include:  – key to Indian species;  – key to the species of Himalayas and Tibet;  – key to the Himalayan species;  and  – key to the Lasius (Dendrolasius) species of East Palaearctic.

 described Lasius
alienoflavus Bingham, 1903 from the Himalayas (above 8000 feet) with reports of worker and queen castes. Later on purely morphological grounds  erected a distinct subgenus Cautolasius and placed Lasius
alienoflavus in it. This subgenus comprises a group of species showing a mixture of characters that put them in a position intermediate between Lasius
sensu stricto and Chthonolasius. Subsequently,  discussed the worker and queen caste of Lasius
alienoflavus and provided a key to the Himalayan members of the genus. In the discussion part he mistakenly assigned the species to the subgenus Chthonolasius. Recently  provided a key for the genus Lasius from the Himalayas.

Here we re-describe the worker and queen castes of Lasius
alienoflavus based on fresh material and for the first time provide a description of the male caste.

Materials and methods
The specimens were collected by handpicking. The morphological analysis was carried on with the aid of a Nikon SMZ 1500 stereo zoom microscope. All digital images were taken with a MP evolution digital camera and subsequently processed with Auto-Montage software (Syncroscopy, Division of Synoptics, Ltd.) and Adobe Photoshop CS5. All measurements were recorded in millimeters using oculometer between 50× and 125× to the nearest 0.001 mm and have been rounded to the nearest 0.01 mm (as the average recording error was approximately 0.005 mm). Specimens have been deposited in PUPAC, Punjabi University Patiala Ant Collection, Patiala.

Measurement
HL – Length of the head measured in full face view in a straight line from the middle of the anterior clypeal margin to the middle of the occipital margin. The head has to be carefully tilted to the position with the real maximum

.

HW – Maximum width of the head in full face view, behind the eyes

.

EL – Maximum eye length with eye in full face view

.

EW – Diameter of eye measured perpendicularly to transect in EL and across structurally defined ommatidia

.

SL – Maximum straight-line length of the scape excluding the basal neck and the condyle

.

WL – Weber’s length – the length of mesosoma in profile from the margin of neck shield to the posterior margin of propodeal lobes

.

PW – Maximum width of the petiole from above, in dorsal view

.

GL – The length of the gaster in lateral view from the anterior most point of first gastral segment to the posterior most point (excluding sting if present)

.

HS – Head size – the total of head length and head width divided by hundred

.

nHS – Number of standing hairs projecting &gt; 0.02 mm from dorsal profile of scape i.e. the number of hairs visible when looking at the small diameter of scape under transmitted-light conditions. The always present hairs on distal apex are not counted and the number refers to one scape

.

nHHT – Number of standing hairs projecting &gt; 0.02 mm from extensor profile of one hind tibia. The always present hairs on distal apex are not counted and the number refers to one tibia

Distribution
The overall distribution of the species is from the Himalaya but the specimens used for this study have been collected from the North-west range of Himalaya. All the collection areas were forested mountains surrounded by other mountains. The nests were very close to the surface with a depth of 3–5 inches. The soil surrounding the nest was mainly moist and covered by herbs. 23 specimens were collected from Winkler extraction.

Taxon discussion
Lasius
alienoflavus Bingham, 1903 is well marked off from other reports of this genus and is a distinct species. However, it resembles Lasius
flavus (Fabricius) but can be readily distinguished from it by having the apical segment of the maxillary palp longer than the preapical one (vs. preapical segment of maxillary palp longer or equal to the apical segment in Lasius
flavus).
