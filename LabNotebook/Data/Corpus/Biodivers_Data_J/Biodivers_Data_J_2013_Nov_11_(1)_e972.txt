Introduction
In the last decades, intensification and mechanization of agricultural practices, introduced in order to maximise productivity, led to a decrease in habitat quality and landscape heterogeneity throughout European agroecosystems. Diffusion of monoculture, increased use of chemicals (i.e. pesticides and fertilizers) and removal of non-cropped areas, like small woodlots and hedges, caused a wide-scale loss of biodiversity ().

Recently, environmentally-friendly agronomic practices and creation of non-cropped habitats have been recognized as a potential solution to this dramatic decline of biodiversity and have become key aims of European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and, as a consequence, of national and regional ones (). In Lombardy lowland, environmentally-friendly measures includes reforestations, creation of hedges and buffer strips, maintenance of meadows and renaturalization of wetlands (, http://www.agricoltura.regione.lombardia.it).

Even if agri-environment schemes (AESs) benefit some farmland species (e.g., ), gaps in the provision of habitat quality and landscape connectivity for many others still exist (, , ). Better understanding on effects of AESs on farmland biodiversity and exhaustive surveys on animal and plant communities in enhanced habitats are required (, ).

The aim of this research was to investigate the Carabid assemblages of an intensive agricultural area (mainly rice fields) subjected to environmental improvements since 1996, in particular the creation of buffer strips along paddy fields and the restoration of an area of ​​150 ha.

Materials and methods
Study area
The study was carried out in an 4.5 km2 agricultural area, mainly cultivated with rice, located in north-western Italy, in the middle of the Po plain, approximately 13 km north from the city of Pavia, in the municipalities of Lacchiarella (MI) and Giussago (PV); barycentre 45°17'38.63"N, 09°08'52.08"E (Fig. ).

The study area included three adjacent rice farms, “La Darsena”, “La Cadenazza” and “Necchi”, and a restored area, “La Cassinazza”. The Carabid fauna was sampled in:

rice field banks (Fig. ): characterized by herbaceous cover (mainly Setaria
glauca, Carex
elata, Avena
sativa, Convolvolus
arvensis, Trifolium
pratense and Lolium
perenne), sporadically with a row of poplar trees (Populus
canadensis);

buffer strips (Fig. ): perimeter land of paddy fields taken out of production and converted into small wetlands and strips of permanent vegetation, planted with autochthonous shrubs and trees (mainly Quercus
robur, Carpinus
betulus, Fraxinus
angustifolia, Crataegus
monogyna, Prunus
spinosa and Salix
cinerea). The first stands were planted in 2003 and, during the study period, strips were fully-developed into arboreal habitats (arboreal buffer strips). The last stands were planted in 2009 and, during the study period, strips were mostly covered by herbaceous vegetation (herbaceous buffer strips, mainly Echinochloa
crus-galli, Polygonum
minus, Setaria
glauca, Lolium
perenne, Chenopodium
album and Humulus
lupulus);

restored area (~150 ha; Fig. ): formerly a farmland area undergoing restoration since 1996. The area is composed by a mosaic of different habitats, including wetlands, reforested areas and meadows, connected by a system of hedges. For the descriptive purposes of this paper, Carabid coenosis of meadows, both wet and dry (herbaceous restored habitats, mainly Convolvolus
arvensis, Lolium
perenne, Lotus
corniculatus, Trifolium
pratense, Solidago
gigantea, Bidens
tripartita and Taraxacum
officinale), was divided from that of the forested areas and hedges (arboreal restored habitats, mainly Quercus
robur, Salix
alba, Carpinus
betulus, Alnus
glutinosa, Ulmus
campestris, Populus
tremula, Fraxinus
angustifolia, Crataegus
monogyna, Prunus
spinosa, Viburnus
opulus and Salix
cinerea).

Sampling method and data analysis
Ground beetles were sampled using plastic pitfall traps (62 mm in diameter and 70 mm deep) buried in the soil and filled with 50 ml of wine vinegar and a drop of detergent (). Pitfalls were covered with a 10 × 10 cm wooden roof to prevent flooding and emptied fortnightly.

Along rice field banks, we placed a total of 60 traps from April to November 2009 and 68 traps from May to November 2010; along buffer strips, we positioned 56 traps from May to November 2009 and 2010; in the restored area, we placed 66 traps from July to November 2009 and from April to November 2010.

Carabids were identified to the species level following the nomenclature of Fauna Europaea (http://www.faunaeur.org, ). Information on chorotype, body size, larval and wing development were reported for each species. Chorotype were obtained from ; larval development were derived from ,  and ; data on body size and wing development were mainly obtained from , and secondly from , . As for body size, according to , species were divided as (a) very small (&lt; 5 mm), (b) small (5 - 9 mm), (c) medium (9 - 15 mm) and (d) large (&gt; 15 mm). Data on adult diet were not available for all species and we reported only the existing information, according to , , ,  and .

A synthetic description of habitat preference, derived from  and personal observations with special reference to the Po plain, were also reported for each species. According to , we classified the species as "rare" when the total capture over the whole area was lower than 0.1% (i.e. &lt; 35 individuals); the other species were classified as "common" and the two most abundant species as "dominant". The total number of captured individuals (n) was reported in brackets.

As for rice field banks and enhanced habitats, ground beetle abundances were expressed both as absolute frequency (i.e. number of collected individuals) and as annual Activity Density (aAD; ), that is the number of collected individuals during the entire sampling period (ntot) divided by sampling effort (US) for each sampling station:

DAa = ntot / US

with US = Σ us and us = trap * (gg/10), where trap is number of traps and gg is the number of days during which the traps were active in each sampling session (Suppl. material ).

Specimens, dried or preserved in alcohol, are stored in the author’s collections (Nicola Pilon, Milano) and in the collection of the University of Pavia.

Analysis
Overall, we collected 34,108 individuals belonging to 98 carabid species. We recorded 65 species in rice field banks, 73 species in buffer strips and 78 in restored habitats. Eight species were found only in rice field banks (Agonum
sexpunctatum, Amara
nitida, Cicindela
campestris, Clivina
collaris, Harpalus
albanicus, Harpalus
pumilus, Ophonus
cribricollis, Pterostichus
macer), 6 species only in herbaceous buffer strips (Amara
littorea, Bembidion
quadripustulatum, Bradycellus
verbasci, Dolichus
halensis, Ophonus
azureus, Panagaeus
cruxmajor), 2 species only in arboreal buffer strips (Badister
sodalis, Drypta
dentata), 2 species only in herbaceous restored habitats (Acupalpus
elegans, Ophonus
diffinis) and 11 species only in arboreal restored habitats (Acinopus
picipes, Acupalpus
flavicollis, Acupalpus
notatus, Agonum
versutum, Agonum
viduum, Limodromus
assimilis, Limodromus
krynickii, Nebria
brevicollis, Ophonus
parallelus, Paranchus
albipes, Synuchus
vivalis). Poecilus
cupreus and Pseudoophonus
rufipes consituted about 55% of the capture with 18 753 individuals.

The collected species belonged to 17 chorotypes (Fig. ), grouped into 4 complexes (Subcosmopolitan, Holoartic, European and Mediterranean). About 80% of the species captured in the area were Holoartic, 13.3% European, 4.1% Mediterranean and 2% Subcosmopolitan (Table ). Most of the species were small (very small species: 18.4%, small species: 46.9%) and medium (28.6%); only 6.1% of the captured carabids had size larger than 15 mm (Calosoma
auropunctatum, Carabus
granulatus, Chlaenius
spoliatus, Dolichus
halensis, Pterostichus
melanarius and Pterostichus
niger). About 80% of the collected species had larvae that develop during summer, without dormancy (i.e. were spring breeders) and 18.4% were species with winter larvae, that grow slowly with compulsory dormancy (i.e. were autumn breeders). Cicindela
campestris (one individual recorded along rice field banks) was the only species with poliennal larvae. Macropterous and pteridimorphic species were 82.7% and 17.3% respectively; we didn’t find any strictly brachypterous species.

Also rice field banks, buffer strips and restored habitats, analyzed separately, were dominated by Holoartic, medium-small, winged species, with summer larvae (Table ); species number and percentages for chorotype, body size, larval and wing development were similar in the different habitat categories (Figs , , , ).

Discussion
On the whole, 98 carabid species were collected in rice field banks, buffer strips adjacent to paddy fields, and restored habitats (herbaceous and arboreal). Species number could be slightly underestimated because of the sampling method which is not very well suited for some taxa as Lebiinae and Bembidinae. Nevertheless, the area resulted species-rich, especially when you consider that it is not placed inside a riverine corridor and when you compare the species number with that recorded in other anthropogenic habitats of the Po plain: 60-70 species in rye, oat and fallow fields (, ); 48 species in a complex of habitats composed by one poplar grove, one artificial wetland, banks of irrigation canals and cropped areas (); 55 species in poplar groves of different ages (); 60 species in meadows of different ages (); 60 species in meadows, crops and reforested areas of two urban parks in Milan ().

Most of the collected carabids, both in the whole area and in each habitat categories, were species with a wide distribution in the Paleartic region, eurytopic and common in European agroecosystems. The assemblages were dominated by small-medium, macropterous species, with summer larvae; we didn’t find any endemism.

No brachypterous and strictly forest-dwelling species were sampled, despite the presence of some recent woodlots (i.e about 10 years old). In fact, species unable to disperse by flight were prevented to colonize these stands (including Abax
continuus Ganglbauer 1891, very common in woods of the Lombardy plain), because of the absence of ecological corridors connecting woodlots with forest remnants (). As a consequence, the Carabid fauna was mainly composed by species of open habitats. Most of the species were also hygrophilous, due to a dense network of artificial irrigation canals and a superficial water-table.

The most interesting aspect of this Carabid coenosis is the presence of several species with southern distribution, quite common in clay soil on the right bank of the Po river, and known only in few stations north of the Po river. Among these species, we list Acinopus
picipes, Amblystomus
niger, Dinodes
decipiens, Harpalus
cupreus, Harpalus
oblitus, Parophonus
mendax, Parophonus
planicollis, Pterostichus
macer. Although a comparison with the past coenosis is not possible for the lack of similar surveys in the area, it could be hypothesized that these species are recent colonizers (7-10 years). They are not reported in the historical catalogue of , and are also not listed in several recent faunistic investigations carried out in the Lombardy lowland, particularly along the Ticino river (, ), Adda river (), Po river (, ) and in Milan (), where potentially suitable habitats were sampled. Even in an intensive survey along the Po river included in Piedmont region, only some of these species have been collected (). If so, we could assume a tendency to a northward shift in the distribution of these species, according to what has been observed for other zoological groups well studied and that have great mobility, such as birds () and dragonflies ().

We underline also the presence of Brachinus
plagiatus, an uncommon halophilous species. Moreover Amara
littorea, an Asiatic-European distribution species, has been recorded with certainty for the first time in Italy ().

Data type: occurrences

In 2009 and 2010, ground beetles (ColeopteraCarabidae) were sampled in an agricultural area of the Po plain (Lombardy, Italy), by means of pitfall traps. The dataset reported frequency (N) and annual Activity Density (AD) of collected species in: (a) rice field banks; (b) herbaceous buffer strips; (c) arboreal buffer strips; (d) herbaceous restored habitats, i.e. wet and dry meadows; (e) arboreal restored habitats, i.e. forested areas and hedges.
