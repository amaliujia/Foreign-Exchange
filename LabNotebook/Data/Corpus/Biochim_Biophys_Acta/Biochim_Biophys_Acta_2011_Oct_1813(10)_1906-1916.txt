Within ECL1, Ala203Leu and Ala206Leu influenced the ability of αCGRP to stimulate adenylate cyclase. In TM3, His219Ala, Leu220Ala and Leu222Ala have influences on αCGRP binding and cAMP production; they are likely to indirectly influence the binding site for αCGRP as well as having an involvement in signal transduction. On the exofacial surfaces of TMs 6 and 7, a number of residues were identified that reduced cell surface receptor expression, most noticeably Leu351Ala and Glu357Ala in TM6. The residues may contribute to the RAMP1 binding interface. Ile360Ala impaired αCGRP-mediated cAMP production. Ile360 is predicted to be located close to ECL2 and may facilitate receptor activation. Identification of several crucial functional loci gives further insight into the activation mechanism of this complex receptor system and may aid rational drug design.

1 Introduction
The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) is a secretin-like (family B) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) protein that, in association with receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), acts as a receptor for α and β calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). αCGRP is a potent vasodilator with important pathophysiological actions especially in migraine. A structure of the N-termini of CLR and RAMP1 has recently been published [29]. RAMP1 and CLR dimerization is required for both ligand binding and cell surface expression [19] and CLR is also known to form an adrenomedullin receptor when it forms a heterodimer with either RAMP2 or RAMP3 [19]. A two-step model of receptor activation has been described for secretin-like GPCRs. Initially the C-terminus of the peptide ligand binds to the extracellular domain of the receptor. Then the N-terminus of the ligand associates with the transmembrane (TM) domain of the receptor including the extracellular loops (ECLs), leading to receptor activation [22]. Broadly, this generic model of receptor activation is likely to apply to the CGRP receptor although the important molecular details specific to αCGRP-binding remain unknown.

Within GPCRs, the ECLs contribute to receptor affinity and efficacy. They may also help orientate the TM bundle and provide key molecular determinants for ligand binding [23]. There is considerable evidence that the ECLs are important for the binding of peptide agonists to secretin-like GPCRs but the details may be receptor specific. Investigations into the parathyroid hormone 1 (PTH1) receptor using chimeric receptors and disulfide-trapping experiments suggest that the hormone has a diffuse pharmacophore making contact across all three ECLs, with the initial N-terminal serine residue positioned between TM5 and TM6 [2,21]. In the glucagon receptor, chimera and mutagenesis experiments also suggest the peptide is able to make extensive contacts across the extracellular TM domain, but the N-terminal residues are predicted to face ECL1 and TM2 [25]. In the secretin receptor, mutagenesis suggests contacts with ECL1 and ECL2, but a model based on photoaffinity cross-linking places the peptide largely in the vicinity of ECL3 [9,13]. Photoaffinity cross-linking data for the binding of GLP-1 suggests that it binds to ECL2 but closer to ECL1 [20].

The role of the ECLs in the CLR remains elusive. Consequently, an alanine scan has been used to investigate ECL1 and ECL3 and their corresponding TM regions. Endogenous alanine residues within this region were substituted to leucine residues to probe the significance of the size and/or geometry of their methyl side chains. Mutant receptors were assessed on multiple criteria including cAMP production, agonist-mediated desensitization (which can provide an indirect measure of β-arrestin association [12]), cell-surface and total expression and human αCGRP binding in an attempt to determine the functional role of the residues within the protein.

2 Methods
2.1 Materials
Human αCGRP was from Calbiochem (Beeston, Nottingham, UK). 125I-iodo8histidyl-human αCGRP was from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences (Waltham, MA). [8-3H] Adenosine 3′, 5′, cyclic phosphate, NH4 salt was from Amersham Biosciences (Chalfont, UK). Chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich UK. For ELISAs, the primary antibody was mouse, anti-HA antibody H9658 [Sigma-Aldrich], the secondary antibody was anti-mouse, horseradish peroxidase conjugated #7076 [Cell Signaling Technology] and SIGMAFASTTM o-phenylenediamine tablets were used.

2.2 Expression constructs and mutagenesis
The expression constructs used were human CLR with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA-CLR) epitope tag and human RAMP1 with an N-terminal myc epitope tag (myc-RAMP1) in pc DNA3.1(–). These were kindly provided by Dr. S. Foord. HA-CLR mutants were generated using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK), as described previously [3]. A snake plot showing the location of the residues mutated and other key features of the transmembrane domain of CLR is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3 Cell culture and transfection
Cos-7 cells were cultured and transfected with polyethyleneimine as described previously [27].

2.4 Radioligand binding
Radioligand binding using 125I-iodo8histidyl-human αCGRP on membranes prepared from transfected Cos-7 cells was as carried out by centrifugation as described previously [3]. The membrane concentration was 0.4 mg/ml.

2.5 Assay of cAMP production
48 well plates were transiently transfected with WT receptor (HA-CLR/myc RAMP1) alongside a mutant receptor in every experiment, to take account of day-to-day differences in transfection and coupling efficiencies. Stimulation with agonists and assay of cAMP was by a radioreceptor assay as described elsewhere [27].

2.6 Analysis of cell surface expression of mutants by ELISA and agonist dependent internalization
24 well plates were transiently transfected with WT receptor and a mutant receptor in every experiment. A negative control of myc RAMP1/empty pcDNA3.1(−) was used. To measure both cell surface and total expression of CLR an ELISA was carried out as described previously [5], but using the antibodies and o-phenylenediamine tablets described in the Materials section. A Biotek EL800 Universial Microplate reader using the 490 nm filter was used to quantify the peroxidise product. Cell surface expression data was normalized to make mean WT expression 100% and the mean myc RAMP1/empty pcDNA3.1(−) vector as 0%. Receptor internalization was measured after 1 h treatment with 100 nM human αCGRP at 37 °C by the above cell surface ELISA procedure.

2.7 Total CLR expression
Total WT and mutant receptor expression was only assessed on mutant receptors that were found to alter cell surface expression. The ELISA procedure outlined above was conducted but after the transfected cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h.

2.8 Construction of a CLR model to show the ECLs
Two CLR TM domain models were constructed. The putative TM segments of CLR were aligned against the TM domains in bovine rhodopsin (inactive, PDB 1U19) and opsin (active, PDB 3DQB) using the alignment proposed by Vohra and co-workers [30]. Modeller9v5 was used to generate 500 models. The models were ranked by Modeller9v5 energy objective function. The top 20 structures were retained and stereochemical quality was assessed by PROCHECKv3.5.4 [16,17]. Based on overall and residue-by-residue geometry a structure was selected.

The loop domains were constructed using the program Loopy [28,31] as described previously [1]. However, ECL2 was divided into two segments. Cys212 is assumed to participate in a highly conserved disulphide bond with Cys282. This was used as an anchor region. To model ECL2, the data of Conner and co-workers was used to select appropriate conformations [4].

The quality of the loop models was assessed by using the methodology to model ECL1 and ECL3 of bovine rhodopsin; these loops were then compared with those found in the crystal structure 1U19. The best ECL1 conformer had a 1.40 Å global root mean squared deviation from the crystal structure and the best ECL3 conformer had 0.74 Å. The mean and mode of the best top 10 conformers for ECL1 did not exceed 1.93 Å and 1.54 Å for ECL3.

The ProPka program [18]
via the PDBQPR server [7] was used to assign the protonation states of the titratable groups in each CLR TM domain model, using the CHARMM parameters set at pH 7.4. The CLR TM models were then orientated on their Z-axis based on the relative position of Tyr165 and Tyr367. The CHARMM (c35b3) GBSW module containing the GB/SA membrane application was used [14]. The all-atom param22/cmap force-field in the presence of a 32 Å implicit membrane was set up. Then 1500 steps of a steepest descent energy minimization followed by 5000 steps of adopted basis Newton-Raphson minimization (or until the root mean squared deviation [RMSD] was less than 0.001 kcal/mol Ǻ) was conducted. TM models contained an acetylated N-terminus and a N-methylamide C-terminus to prevent unnecessary large electrostatic attractive forces between the helical ends during energy minimization.

2.9 Statistical analysis of data
Curve fitting was completed by GraphPad Prism 4 as described previously [1]. A two-tailed independent t-test was used to determine significance between dose–response curve conditions. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine significance between conditions used in ELISA based assays. The analysis is indicated in the table and figure legends and has been described previously [1].

3 Results
3.1 Stimulation of cAMP production
Each mutant was challenged with human αCGRP and cAMP production was measured (Table 1, Figs. 2 and 3). For ECL1 a reduction in αCGRP potency (as assessed by significant differences in pEC50 values compared to WT receptors) was observed in the mutant receptors (in the order of the magnitude of EC50 fold decrease); Leu195Ala (~ 30 fold), Ala199Leu (~ 20 fold), Val198Ala (~ 11 fold), His219Ala (~ 11 fold) and Cys212Ala (~ 9 fold). In contrast, an increase in αCGRP potency was found in Leu220Ala (~ 25 fold), Ala203Leu (~ 11 fold), Ala206Leu (~ 9 fold) and Leu222Ala (~ 6 fold). In ECL3, Glu357Ala was found to significantly decrease pEC50 by ~ 33 fold compared to WT; this mutant also showed decreased maximal responses (41.7% ± 17.9%). Ile360Ala was also found to significantly decrease pEC50 by ~ 7 fold compared to WT.

For a number of mutants, there were changes in either basal activity or maximum response. However, in most cases these were small (Table 2). There were ~ 40% increases in maximum response for Leu204Ala and Gln216Ala in ECL1 and for Val350Ala, Arg355Ala, Ala361Leu and Met369Ala in ECL3. For Leu204Ala and Arg355Ala there was also a ~ 30% increase in basal activity; Pro209Ala and Val210Ala had a similar increase in this parameter.

3.2 Cell surface receptor expression
Expression of receptors was measured using a cell-surface ELISA (Table 3). Statistically significant reductions in cell-surface expression were seen in nine mutants in ECL1. The largest reduction in cell surface expression was with Met223Ala (~ 40%) but overall the cell surface reductions seen in these mutants were fairly modest, although four consecutive mutants (Phe217Ala, Ile218Ala, His219Ala and Leu220Ala) reduced cell surface expression. Four mutants in ECL1 were found to increase cell surface expression significantly, but the effect was not much more than a 30% increase (Table 3). By contrast, in ECL3 there were large decreases in expression for Glu357Ala and Leu351Ala (&gt; 70%). Gly358Ala, Tyr356Ala and Tyr367Ala showed decreases of around 40%. There were smaller changes in a further seven mutants (see Table 3). An increase in cell surface expression was found in His370Ala (of 41%) and Pro353Ala (33%).

3.3 Total receptor expression
Total receptor expression probing for the HA epitope was assessed on mutant receptors that were either found to have a significantly different pEC50 and/or cell surface expression. For residues in ECL1, a significant, yet modest, increase in total expression was observed in Val205Ala and Ala206Leu. A significant decrease in total expression was seen in Cys212Ala and His219Ala but again the size of the effect was only modest (Table 4). For ECL3, a significant 44% increase in total expression compared to WT was observed in Pro353Ala. A significant but modest decrease (22%) in total expression was observed in Asp366Ala.

3.4 αCGRP mediated internalization
In ECL1, αCGRP mediated internalization was severely impaired or abolished in Leu195Ala and Ala199Leu and significantly reduced in Cys212Ala and Val198Ala. In contrast, Asn208Ala and His219Ala were found to internalize moderately more readily than WT (Table 5).

For ECL3, internalization was severely impaired by Glu357Ala and significantly reduced in Leu351Ala, Pro353Ala and Trp354Ala. In contrast, Glu362Ala and Ile371Ala were found to internalize more readily than WT (Table 5).

3.5 Inhibition of 125I-αCGRP radioligand binding
The ability of αCGRP to displace 125I-αCGRP was investigated on mutant receptors that were either found to have a significantly different mean pEC50 and/or agonist-mediated internalization when compared to WT (see Table 6, Fig. 4). For ECL1, the pIC50 of four mutants were significantly reduced when compared to WT; Leu195Ala, Ala199Leu, Cys212Ala and His219Ala. In contrast, the pIC50 of Leu200Ala showed an increase compared to WT. For ECL3, the mean pIC50 of two mutants were significantly reduced; Leu351Ala and Glu357Ala. The decrease for Ile360Ala approached significance (p = 0.052). Contrastingly, the pIC50 of Ile371Ala showed a small increase compared to WT.

3.6 ECL1 and ECL3 in the CLR model
The models of CLR are shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7. A number of important features can be noted. In ECL1, Leu195, Val198 and Ala199 residues when mutated, impaired normal CGRP receptor pharmacology but still expressed at the cell surface are predicted to form a cluster at the top of TM2 and are close to the N-terminal segment of ECL2. They are also close to Ile371 of TM7, which showed enhanced internalization and a small increase in affinity for αCGRP upon mutation. Ala203 and Ala206, which on mutation increased αCGRP potency, are predicted to be at the top of ECL1. His219Ala, Leu220Ala and L222Ala all influenced αCGRP efficacy and the residues are predicted to be located in the middle of TM3. Leu351Ala, Arg355Ala, Glu357Ala, Gly358Ala, Lys359Ala, Glu362Ala, Tyr365Ala, Tyr367Ala and Ile371Ala were found to decrease cell surface expression and they are all predicted to be located across TM6, ECL3 and TM7. These residues are predicted to face outwards toward the supposed lipid environment (Fig. 7).

4 Discussion
Currently, it is unclear how extracellular loops in Secretin-like GPCRs contribute to receptor functioning. A systematic alanine/leucine scan was conducted on ECL1 and ECL3 of CLR and their corresponding juxtamembrane regions. Mutant CGRP receptors were assessed on multiple criteria including; cAMP accumulation, cell surface expression, total expression, agonist mediated internalization and αCGRP radioligand binding. This approach found that both regions of the receptor are required for normal receptor pharmacology and has revealed key molecular determinants that facilitate receptor activation.

A cluster of three residues, Leu195, Val198 and Ala199 that are located at the top of TM2 and predicted to face into the TM bundle (Fig. 5) are required for CGRP receptor function. Both Leu195 and Ala199 disrupted CGRP binding when mutated, thereby providing a likely explanation of their effects. Leu195 and Ala199 may directly participate in the orthosteric binding site or the mutations could indirectly impair αCGRP binding (e.g. disrupt helical packing or water–lipid interface). The hydrophobic triplet cluster is predicted to be between TM1, 2 and 7. Within rhodopsin-like GPCRs, this region of the receptor has been termed the “minor groove” when considering ligand binding and it has been suggested that it is important for activation, particularly of beta-arrestin [24]. Interestingly Ile371, which is predicted to be in close proximity to the groove, increased CGRP receptor internalization when mutated to alanine, possibly reflecting better association of the receptor with β-arrestin. It is not known if a minor groove exists in secretin-like GPCRs, but there is evidence that the region is important. In the family B receptors, the consensus residue at Leu195 is actually an aspartate, which is part of a Lys/ArgGluArg motif found in 10/15 of human secretin-like GPCRs (Supplementary Fig. 1). Langer et al., [15] found that mutating this motif reduced the ability of the VPAC1 receptor to stimulate cAMP production. This observation is in line with previous studies on the VPAC1 receptor [10] and the secretin receptor [6]. Although primary sequence is not conserved, these observations support the importance of this region in secretin-like GPCRs. There is evidence that small-molecule calcitonin agonists interact with residues at the exofacial end of TM1 [8]. This again suggests the plausibility of a molecular switch necessary for activation within this region of the receptor.

Within ECL1 itself, Ala203Leu and Ala206Leu were found to increase the potency of αCGRP in its ability to stimulate cAMP. It is plausible that the introduced leucines assist αCGRP docking into the TM domain, although the mechanism behind this is unknown. At the very base of ECL1, mutation of Cys212 severely impaired receptor function, consistent with its involvement in a disulfide bond with C282 located in ECL2; a highly conserved feature of all GPCRs.

A cluster of three residues is predicted to be located in the middle of TM3 (Fig. 6). His219Ala reduced total and cell surface expression and cAMP production. However the receptor showed a small increase in agonist mediated internalization, possibly suggesting an increase in coupling to β-arrestin. Leu220Ala and Leu222Ala increased the potency of αCGRP in stimulating cAMP production and Leu222Ala was found to significantly enhance αCGRP binding. In rhodopsin-like GPCRs, TM3 is crucial for receptor activation and these residues may define a portion of the helix that is important for mediating conformational changes in CLR [32]. Models of CLR based on different activity states of rhodopsin suggested that TM3 in CLR might undergo a subtle rotational movement upon activation, which changes the relative positions of His219, Leu220 and Leu222. This is very speculative, but given that there are some shared features in the activation mechanisms of rhodopsin- and secretin-like GPCRs [3,26], this cluster of residues is in an excellent position to take part in inter-helical interactions. Yet, it cannot be ruled out that αCGRP may directly influence this cluster of residues. Cross-linking data indicates that the N-terminus of PTH is in close proximity to Phe424 of the PTH1 receptor [21]; in our model of CLR, the equivalent to this residue (Ile352, discussed below), is at a similar level in the helical bundle to Leu220 (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Thus it remains plausible that αCGRP may penetrate deep within the juxtamembrane domain.

Within the predicted ECL3 (Fig. 7), Ile360Ala had major effects on CGRP potency. This is predicted to be in the center of ECL3, in close proximity to ECL2. It significantly reduced cAMP production. It is reasonable to speculate that Ile360 contributes either directly to the signal transduction process mediated by αCGRP or participates indirectly by stabilizing ECL2.

Half of the mutants in ECL3 and the associated juxtamembrane regions reduced cell surface expression of the CGRP receptor but had no effect on total receptor expression. Glu357 in ECL3 and Leu351, deep in TM6, are particularly important for normal CGRP receptor cell surface expression. Experimental evidence has shown that RAMP3 dimerized with the secretin receptor at TM6 and TM7 [11]; a result consistent with an earlier prediction from evolutionary trace analysis [30]. Most of the residues, which were found to have a decrease in cell surface expression, are predicted to be located across TM6, ECL3 and TM7 with their side-chains facing outwards toward the lipid environment (Fig. 7), although some intra-helical packing effects cannot be ruled as Glu357 is predicted in the inactive model to associate with TM5. The modeling is speculative as the rhodopsin template used for this is not truly representative, although we have used it to successfully predict the effects of mutations in TM6 [3]. However, given these limitations, the model predicts the mutations identified could theoretically participate in a RAMP1 interface disrupting the efficiency of CLR and RAMP1 dimerization. RAMP1 is a chaperone protein and its association to CLR is essential for CGRP receptor trafficking to the cell surface [19].

Given that movements of TM6 are needed for GPCR activation [3,32] it is interesting that a cluster of residues at the TM6–TM7 interface (Ile352Ala, Arg355Ala, Lys359Ala, Tyr365Ala and Tyr367Ala) are associated with increases in either basal activity or maximum response on mutation. Within the PTH receptor, Leu368, Tyr421 and Phe424 have been shown to be in close proximity to the N-terminus of bound PTH [21] and so may be involved in agonist-mediated conformational changes; Phe424 of the PTH receptor is the equivalent of Ile352 of CLR. Given the increase in basal activity it is possible that these residues may help constrain an inactive receptor conformation. This effect may be mediated by intra-helical packing within the CLR or via RAMP1 interactions. This adds to earlier work showing that TM6 of CLR is needed for CGRP receptor signal transduction [3].

In conclusion, it is clear that both ECL1 and ECL3 of CLR are essential in the normal functioning of the CGRP receptor. Novel molecular determinants have been found that enhance and impair both the affinity and efficacy of the receptor. Within ECL1 and its associated TM regions are key residues that regulate both the binding and the efficacy of αCGRP. ECL3 and its associated TM domains are important for cell surface receptor expression, possibly by promoting RAMP1 association. Furthermore there are also individual residues, which contribute to recognition of αCGRP and its efficacy. It remains to be shown whether residues within the loops are in direct contact with αCGRP. This study will aid further efforts to probe the extracellular surface of the CGRP receptor along with RAMP1/CLR interface and guide future experiments to map out the large diffuse pharmacophore of αCGRP.

The WT and mutant cAMP dose–response comparison curves were normalized from 0% to 100% based on WT Top and Bottom values generated by GraphPad Prism 4. The Emax and basal activity of each mutant was assessed by the mean of the top and bottom of each dose–response curve. The mutant receptors mean Emax and basal activity was expressed as a percentage that corresponded to WT normalization. A difference was noted if the mean size of effect differed by 20% or more. Values reported are mutant percent means ± S.E.M. (% WT).

Cell surface expression ELISA was used to probe for the presence of the HA epitope. Mutant HA CLR/myc RAMP1 receptors were compared with WT HA CLR/myc RAMP1 receptors. 3–6 independent experiments that contained triplicate data points were used in analysis. The raw data for each independent experiment was normalized where the mean WT receptor cell-surface expression equalled a 100% and the mean negative control (myc RAMP1/empty pcDNA3.1−) was equal to 0%. Values reported are mutant means ± S.E.M. (% WT). Mutant cell surface expression was compared to WT receptor using a Mann–Whitney U test.

Total expression of HA-tagged receptors both mutant and WT were analyzed when co-transfected with myc RAMP1 using an ELISA. At least 3 independent experiments containing triplicate data points were used in analysis. Total expression in the mutant condition was normalized to the WT condition (equal to 100%) and negative control (myc RAMP1/empty pcDNA3.1− after 0.1% Triton X-100, which was equal to 0%). A Mann–Whitney U test was used to assess statistical differences between WT and mutant receptors.

Agonist mediated internalization of the CGRP receptor (both WT and mutant receptors) was approximated by a HA epitope probing cell surface ELISA taking into account the difference in cell surface expression levels between CGRP receptors that have or have not been exposed to 100 nM of human αCGRP for an 1 h. Percent mean ± S.E.M. agonist mediated internalization was determined by 3–6 independent experiments that contained triplicate data points. A Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare mutant and WT percent agonist internalization.
