Background
Cyanobacterial species are the aerobic, photosynthetic, gram
negative, nitrogen fixing bacteria varying in size and shapes
(single cell, filamentous cell, colonial cell form) evolved 3.5
billion years ago in Precambrian period, cosmopolitan in
distribution. The role of cyanobacteria in nitrogen fixation and
in the maintenance of the fertility of rice is well documented
[]. Cyanobacteria presumably faced high fluxes of ultraviolet
radiations (UVR), which must have acted as an evolutionary
pressure leading to the selection for effective protecting
mechanisms. They make a good contribution to phytoplankton
primary productivity of oceanic regions [].

Due to UV exposure (UV-B, UV-A or both) cyanobacterial
species experience reduction in growth, photosynthetic
pigments, proteins and increase proline and lipid peroxidation
activities. Apart from the deleterious effects, cyanobacteria
have ability to withstand under UV-B stress condition by
counteracting the damaging effects like repair of UV-induced
damage of DNA by photo reactivation and excision repair,
accumulation of carotenoids and detoxifying enzymes or
radical quenchers and antioxidants for harmful radicals or
oxygen species [,
,
]. Also involve the production of UV-B
protecting compounds such as mycosporine like amino acids
(MAAs) which enhance the life of cyanobacteria to some extent
[].

MAAs are water soluble cyclohexane or cyclohexenimine
chromophore conjugated with the nitrogen substituent of an
amino acid or its imino alcohol having absorption maxima
ranging from 310 to 360 nm. MAA is synthesized by shikimate
pathway (prokaryotes) and by pentose phosphate pathway
(eukaryotes) [,
]. The UV radiation in cyanobacteria alter
protein, DNA, surviving rates, pigmentation, motility, oxygen
photoevolution, carbon di-oxide, and nitrogen fixation and
phycobiliprotein content []. There are number of MAAs
compound like M-tau, dehydroxylusujirene, M-343,
Mycosporine glycine, Shinorine etc. are produced in number
of cyanobacterial species like Anabaena species, Synechocystis
species, Nostoc species, Plectonema species, Aphanothece species 
[].
In this present work, we have selected two cyanobacterial
species Anabaena cylindrica and Synechocystis PCC 6803 which
are good UV-stress tolerant species along with salinity, heat,
oxidative, alkali, drought, water stress , radioactive resistance
tolerant ability. Our aim in this present work is comparative
analysis of 3-dehydroquinate synthase, key enzyme for the
synthesis of shinorine compound in Anabaena cylindrica and 3-
phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyl transferase a key enzyme for
the synthesis of mycosporine glycine production in
Synechocystis PCC 6803 species with the help of bioinformatic
tools and to find out the level of conservation and variability
regions in the other 16 (sixteen) cyanobacterial species along
with these 2(two) species (Anabaena cylindrica and Synechocystis
PCC 6803) for proteins evolved in MAA production pathway.

Methodology
Selection of protein sequences from cyanobacteria
Synechocystis PCC 6803 and Anabaena cylindrica:
The Cyanobacterial protein sequence 3-phosphoshikimate 1-
carboxyvinyltransferase for producing mycosporine glycine in
Synechocystis PCC 6803 and 3-dehydroquinate synthase for
producing shinorine in Anabaena cylindrica was retrieved from
the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database through their entrez search. The work started by
performing Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) on
base protein sequence (3- dehydroquinate synthase) of
Anabaena cylindrica and (3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyl
transferase) of Synechocystis PCC6803, then with the help of
BLAST results and another parameters like Max.score , E-value
/ Max.identity of the similar sequences related to protein base
sequence were found and were successfully downloaded from
NCBI databases. After creating a FASTA file of all those
sequences that were used the data obtained was incorporated
into MEGA5 software for further analysis. The alignment of all
protein sequences was done by using MUSCLE algorithm. The
alignment result was saved in MAS file with the help of which
further work was carried out. The overall mean distance was
counted by using “Poisson Model” and on the basis of that
overall mean distance the dendogram was generated. The
number of conserved sites, variables sites, singleton sites and
parsimony information sites was calculated by using explore
data file. Finally the sequence MAS file was used in finding
relative rate test. Here, in present analysis the Tree Newick rate
test was used. The rate test was found by using base sequence
and other sequences one by one, with the help of which
identical sites, divergent sites and unique differences among
the sequence was found and consequences of which free
analysis was done. Using T-COFFEE (verson_685) tool a library
of pair wise alignments was produced to guide the multiple
sequence alignment and then protein variability tool variability
plot was obtained.

The computational analysis was performed in silico using web
based software and servers. The alignment of cyanobacterial
protein sequences with the other 16 related sequences to find
out the identical sequences in other cyanobacteria with
respect to 3-dehydroquinate synthase, key enzyme for the
synthesis of shinorine compound and 3-phosphoshikimate-1-
carboxyvinyl transferase a key enzyme for the synthesis of
mycosporine glycine. Also analysis of the similarity and
variability using phylogenetic analysis was done which shows
the evolutionary relationship in phylogenetic tree.

The Cyanobacterial protein sequence 3-phosphoshikimate 1-
carboxyvinyltransferase for producing mycosporine glycine of
Synechocystis PCC 6803 and 3-dehydroquinate synthase for

from the NCBI database. The sequence was converted into
FASTA format. Then the BLAST software from NCBI was used.

sequence which shows max. score, E- value and maximum
identity.

Multiple sequence alignment was performed with MUSCLE
separately for the respective enzymes with the selected
cyanobacterial species . Phylogenetic and
bioinformatic analysis of Mycosporine like amino acids
producing protein sequence in Anabaena cylindrica and its blast
searched eight protein sequences provide a useful framework
to understand the relationship of the different forms and how
they have evolved from a common ancestor. T- COFFEE
(verson_685) and protein variability plot shows the
maximum similarity in Mycosporine like Amino acids
producing protein sequences in the selected cyanobacterial
strains.

The scores of Multiple Sequence Alignment of enzyme
sequences obtained from 17 species strains of cyanobacteria
associated with Mycosporine like amino acids have been found
to be between 72 to 75 which predict a high level of homology
and conservation and negligible percentage of gaps amongst
the amino acid residues. Similarly T-COFFEE (version_685)
results show high level of identity, similarity and positives
towards the Good (Red) then towards Average (Yellow) and
least towards Bad (Green) which indicate high level of
conservation amongst residues . The
Cladogram analysis also shows vicinity among the proteins
during the process of evolution since nodes are very close to
each other. The cladogram is smaller in length, it has fewer
homoplasies and it is more parsimonious . The
Shannon Variability coefficient seems to be high in few residues
which shows that these amino acid residues are prone to
mutations during evolution while others seem to be less
variable which confirms that variability is less and conservation
is more among these residues . To confirm our
findings we found that Shannon Variability coefficient comes
out to be less than 2 in some residues which again indicate
conservation amongst the residues where as in some it comes to
be less than 1 which means that these residues are highly
conserved while few other residues are variable with values
more than 2. The same is confirmed by Simpson 
and Wu- Kabat variability index .

Conclusion
Different cyanobacteria contain different proteins to combat the
problem of UV stress. These proteins seem to be conserved but
the residues are prone to variations which means different
cyanobacteria might have evolved different physiological
processes to combat Ultraviolet stress. The location of MAAs
within cell is not well defined. Therefore, further study is
needed to localize the intracellular distribution of MAAs in
different organisms and the regions which express MAA׳s. The
occurrence of MAAs in phylogenetically related members can
also be used for chemotaxonomic purposes.
