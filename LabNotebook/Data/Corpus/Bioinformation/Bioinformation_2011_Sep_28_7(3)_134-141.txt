Background
Histones are small basic proteins with two domains. The Cterminal
domain is located inside the nucleosome core and the
N-terminal domain is rich in lysine residues extending out of
the nucleosome core []. Positive charge of the lysine residues
makes the histones to bind with the negatively charged DNA
that mainly regulates the interactions between DNA and
histones. A single nucleosomal unit consists of octameric
histones (H3–H4 tetramer and H2A–H2B dimer) coiled by a
stretch of 146 base pairs of DNA. Among the above four
histones, H3 and H4 are mainly targeted for various posttranslational
modifications including acetylation,
phosphorylation, and methylation [,
]. Among such
modifications, in particular, acetylation has been highlighted as
an important mechanism in post-transcriptional determination
[,
]. 
Acetylation of the histones can be controlled by two
counteracting enzymes in the form of antagonist such as
Histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and HDACs. Addition and
removal of acetyl moieties were catalyzed from the ε -amino
groups of lysines [–]. HDACs are important gene expression
regulators in eukaryotic cells affecting angiogenesis, cell-cycle
arrest, apoptosis, terminal differentiation of different cell types
[,
]. 
Phylogenic analyses reveal human HDACs into four
distinct classes, Class I-IV. Class I includes HDACs 1-3 and 8
that are homologous to yeast Rpd3 (exclusively expressed in the
nucleus). Class II includes HDACs 4-7, 9 and 10 that are
homologous to yeast Hda1 (shuttled between the cytoplasm
and the nucleus). Class III includes Sirtuins 1-7 that are
homologous to yeast sir2. Class IV, the recently identified one
includes HDAC 11. Class III HDACs are structurally unrelated
to the other three classes of HDACs and Class IV HDACs
possess structural homology and has only a low overall
sequence similarity with both classes I and II. HDACs 1-11 are
metalloenzymes that require Zn (II) at catalytic site for
deacetylation mechanism. HDACs in classes I and IV are 42-45
kDa, whereas class II HDACs are about 120-130 kDa in size 
[–]. 
The malignancy of leukemias and lymphomas are linked to
the aberrant recruitment of HDACs [,
]. The HDAC
inhibitors (HDACIs) are reported to have anti-tumor activity in
preclinical models and in clinical trials, promisingly to become
new antineoplastic drugs []. HDACIs are shown to alter gene
transcription and exert various anti-tumor effects 
[,
,
].
HDAC8 protects the human ever-shorter telomerase 1b protein,
a telomerase activator from ubiquitin-mediated degradation
[], associates with R-actin cytoskeleton and plays a vital role
in the regulation of contractility in differentiating smooth
muscle cells []. Recent studies indicate that HDAC8 inhibitor
induces apoptosis in T cell derived tumor cells but not
increasing the histone or tubulin acetylation levels 
[].
Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a HDAC inhibitor
has been clinically validated and approved by Food and Drugs
Administration in the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma
as a new therapeutic drug []. In the recent computational
studies [–], 
it was observed that the known HDAC
inhibitors and newly designed HDAC8 inhibitors docked at the
active site of HDAC8 are showing the potent results. These
results could be used to synthesize the HDAC8 inhibitors or
suggesting designing some novel inhibitors against HDAC8 in
further studies. Our current study aims to use the SBDD
approach for designing new compounds which are structurally
related to SAHA inhibitor. Simultaneously, HTVs, IFD and
Prime MM-GBSA studies were also carried out. Then, hydrogen
and hydrophobic interaction studies were analyzed in the
docked complexes. The results of in silico and interactions
studies of SBDD complexes were compared with that of in silico
results of SAHA to show the inhibitory potency of the designed
inhibitors. These comparisons suggest that the designed SAHA
like compounds can be used as HDACIs against carcinogenesis
in future. The designed HDACIs may be potent in the in vitro
and in vivo studies.

Methodology
All the molecular modeling calculations like rigid (HTVs) and
flexible (IFD) docking, binding free energy calculation, and
ADME/Tox were carried out using Glide software (Schrödinger
LLC 2009, USA) in CentOS EL-5 workstation. PyMOL software
was used for graphical visualization, analysis of the hydrogen
bond interactions and Zn (II) coordination geometry to produce
quality images. Hydrophobic interactions were observed
between the active site of target and ligand using Ligplot
software [].

Protein Preparation
The X-ray crystal structure of human HDAC8 complexed with
SAHA (1T69) was recovered from Protein Data Bank (PDB:
www.rcsb.org). The deposited structure of PDB was modified
viz addition of hydrogen atoms, assigning correct bond orders,
fixing of the charges and orientation of groups for Glide
modeling calculations. The orientation of hydroxyl groups and
amide groups of ASN, GLN and HIS were converted into the
charged state. The amino acid flips were assigned and H-bonds
optimized iteratively. Non-hydrogen atoms were energy
minimized until the average root mean square deviation
reaches 0.3Å. Schrödinger modules Glide, Prime, QSite, Liasion
and MacroModel were used for protein preparation.

Structure Based Drug Design and Ligand Preparation
SBDD has the potential significance in pharmaceutical related
researches, especially in the new drug design progress 
[–].
Application of SBDD techniques is supported by an exponential
growth in the number of experimental protein 3D structures
from X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy 
[,
]. The
HDAC8 active site consists of a long, narrow and primarily
hydrophobic tunnel formed by G151, F152, H180, F208, M274,
and Y306. The end of the hydrophobic tunnel contains a
catalytic site []. Designing a series of 120 hydroxamic acid
derivatives (data not shown) based on the active site residues
and the catalytic Zn (II) using SBDD approach has been carried
out for the molecular modeling studies. The basic core of the
molecules is similar to SAHA inhibitor. Designed inhibitors
were subjected into ligand preparation by Ligprep 2.3 module
(Schrödinger). Ligprep performs addition of hydrogens, 2D to
3D conversion, realistic bond lengths and bond angles, low
energy structure with correct chiralities, ionization states,
tautomers, stereochemistries and ring conformation.

High Throughput Virtual screening
HTVs is one of the methods to screen one or more compounds
from a set of compounds. Glide performs HTVs that requires
previously calculated receptor grid and one or more ligand
structures. The active site of the receptor and its properties were
calculated on a grid that provides accurate scoring function
along with energy when ligand is docked. The receptor grid
allows the ligands to bind in more than one possible and
meaningful conformation. During the receptor grid generation
process, the minimized crystal structure bound with SAHA was
loaded in the workspace; the active site of the receptor was
calculated automatically and shown as a grid box by picking
the ligand. In HTVs, the flexibility of the receptor is restricted,
but van der Waals radii of non-polar atoms were calculated to
decrease close contact penalties between ligand and active site
residues. All the designed compounds were screened against
the calculated grid box using Standard Precision (SP) docking
and 30 best compounds were selected based on the Docking
score, Glide energy, Glide emodel and non-bonded interactions.
The selected compounds were subjected to Extra Precision (XP)
docking, which is a more powerful scoring and discriminating
procedure, where the receptor was held rigid while docking. XP
docking took more time for screening compared to SP docking.
Eight compounds () were chosen by the above selection
method to proceed with IFD.

Induced Fit Docking
In SP and XP docking studies, ligands were docked at the active
site of a receptor, where the receptor was held rigid and the
ligands were free to rotate. However, rigid receptor with
flexible ligand may provide misleading results in docking
simulation. When ligand binds at the active site, it undergoes
side-chain or backbone conformation or both in many proteins.
These conformational changes allow the receptor to generate
close conforms to the shape and binding mode of the ligand.
This is known as IFD. IFD is one of the main complicating
factors in SBDD studies and predicts accurate ligand binding
modes and concomitant structural movements in the receptor
using modules of Glide and Prime. Python scripts automate the
IFD process and an interface in Maestro (Schrödinger). Energy
minimized human HDAC8 protein complexed with SAHA was
loaded in the workspace and the ligand was selected to specify
the active site. Then, the IFD calculations were carried out for
eight compounds (from SP and XP screening). Van der Waals
radii of non-polar atoms of the receptor and ligand were scaled
by a factor of 0.50, and 20 conformational poses were calculated.
Based on the docking score, Glide energy, Glide emodel and
non bonded interactions noticed in IFD results, the best
conformation was chosen for further calculations.

Prime MM-GBSA
Prime MM-GBSA approach was used to calculate ligand
binding energies and ligand strain energies for a ligand and a
single receptor. MM-GBSA is a method that combines OPLSAA
molecular mechanics energies (EMM), an SGB solvation
model for polar solvation (GSGB), and a non-polar solvation
term (GNP) composed of the non-polar solvent accessible
surface area and van der Waals interactions. Here, the IFD pose
viewer file of the best conformation chosen was given as the
source in Prime MM-GBSA simulation. The total free energy of
binding: ΔGbind = Gcomplex – ( Gprotein + Gligand ), where G
= EMM + GSGB + GNP

ADME/Tox
QikProp, the prediction program designed by Prof. William L.
Jorgensen was used to calculate ADME (Absorption,
Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) properties. Qikprop is
quick, accurate and predicts physically significant descriptors
and pharmaceutically relevant properties of organic molecules.
Ligprep minimized ligands were given as a source in Qikprop
3.2. Qikprop modules provide the ranges of molecular
predicting properties for comparing the properties of a
particular molecule with those of 95% of known drugs
(Schrödinger 2009).

Prime MM-GBSA and ADME/Tox
Prime MM-GBSA calculation was carried out for SAHA as well
as for the eight compounds designed by SBDD approach.
SAHA has the binding free energy (ΔG) of ­42.28, which is
compared with SBDD compounds. Cmp14, 22, 52, and 108
showed good binding free energy (ΔG) ­65.40, ­66.66, ­65.40,
and ­65.98, respectively. Cmp17, 36, 118 and 119 also have
favorable binding energies of ­45.69, ­58.63, ­54.93, and ­59.77,
respectively. All the above compounds have promising free
energy calculated in the HDAC8 docked complexes ().
Using the compounds designed by SBDD, the physiochemical
properties were calculated in Qikprop simulation. All the
compounds obey the Lipinski's rules: molecular weight below
500 Da, hydrogen bond donor (less than five except for Cmp36)
and acceptor (less than ten). QPlogPo/w (octanol/water
partition coefficient) for all the compounds is less than five.
Cmp36 alone is violating (). Total solvent accessible
surface area (SASA), hydrophobic component of the SASA
(FOSA) and hydrophilic component of the SASA (FISA) were
analyzed for the compounds that were abiding the ranges in
Qikprop physiochemical properties. Qualitative human oral
absorption was predicted. Cmp14, 17, 22, and 52 have high oral
absorption (score: 3). Cmp108, 118, and 119 have medium oral
absorption (score: 2). However, Cmp36 alone has low oral
absorption (score: 1). Polar nitrogen and oxygen van der Waals
surface area (PSA) of SBDD compounds were fulfilling the limit
in physicochemical calculation (). All the compounds
satisfy the values of partition coefficient of octanol/gas
(QPlogPoct), water/gas (QPlogPw) and brain/blood
(QPlogBB). Aqueous solubility (QPlogS) and skin permeability
(QPlogKp) predicted for ligands lie in the allowed the solubility
and permeability range ().

Conclusion:
In this study, 120 hydroxamic acid derivative inhibitors
designed using SBDD approach were screened and eight
compounds were taken against HDAC8 for the docking studies.
These results were compared with SAHA using docking
studies, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions, binding
free energy and physicochemical properties of ADME/Tox.
Cmp22 and 119 have good docking score in IFD. Glide energy
and emodel calculations showed that Cmp17 and Cmp22 have
good values. Remaining SBDD compounds showed favorable
docking score, glide energy and emodel. SBDD docked
complexes showed good stability from energy calculations.
Hydrogen bond interactions were analyzed for SBDD
compounds that have favorable interactions with active site
residues. Cmp36 has nine hydrogen bond interactions at the
active site residues. However, the D…A distance range is 2.78­
2.97 Å for all the hydrogen bonds in Cmp22 with the active site
residues and rest of the compounds possess some of the
hydrogen bonds with distances more than 3.00 Å. G151, F152,
H180, F208, M274 and Y306 residues were primarily
hydrophobic and form a tunnel shape at the active site of
HDAC8 []. IFD reveals that G151, F152, H180, F208, M274 and
Y306 residues have hydrophobic interactions. Octahedral
coordination is formed with Zn (II) ion in all the complexes.
Binding free energy calculation has favorable scores in the
SBDD complexes. However, Cmp22 has good free energy value
among all the complexes. In physicochemical properties,
Cmp14, 17, 22, 52, 108, 118 and 119 abide the Lipinski's rule of
five and human oral absorption. All the compounds satisfied
surface area calculations of SASA, FOSA, FISA, PSA and
partition coefficient of QPlogPoct, QplogPw and QplogBB. All
the SBDD compounds (except Cmp36) have a potent inhibitory
property. Cmp22 satisfies all the in silico criteria like docking
score, glide energy, glide emodel, free energy score,
ADME/Tox, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions. All
SBDD compounds are favorable against HDAC8 and Cmp22 is
found to be more potent among them, suggesting that
inhibition of HDAC8 by Cmp22 could be revealed through in
vivo and in vitro studies so that it could be used against various
cancer therapies.
