and determining cell fates of various normal and cancerous stem cells. Recent reports suggest that targeting this GTP-binding
protein may have therapeutic value in cancer. Although, sequence analyzing revealed that nucleostemin (NS) comprises 5
permuted GTP-binding motifs, a crystal structure for this protein is missing at Protein Data Bank (PDB). Obviously, any attempt
for predicting of NS structure can further our knowledge on its functional sites and subsequently designing molecular inhibitors.
Herein, we used bioinformatics tools and could model 262 amino acids of NS (132-393 aa). Initial models were built by
MODELLER, refined with Scwrl4 program, and validated with ProsA and Jcsc databases as well as PSVS software. Then, the best
quality model was chosen for motif and domain analyzing by Pfam, PROSITE and PRINTS. The final model was visualized by
vmd program. This predicted model may pave the way for next studies regarding ligand binding states and interaction sites as
well as screening of databases for potential inhibitors.



   
Background
Human GNL3 (nucleostemin) has been viewed as a nucleolar
protein with variety of roles, including pre-rRNA processing,
cell-cycle control, telomere stability, genomic integrity and selfrenewal
maintaining of embryonic and tissue stem cells [1,
2].
Since its discovery in 2002, there are accumulating reports that
nucleostemin (NS) is also abundantly expressed in many
cancerous cells, and contributed directly to formation of cancer
stem cells (CSCs), highlighting its importance as diagnostic
marker and/or therapeutic target in cancer [1,
2]. In this line,
we and other groups evidenced that NS depletion can inhibit
tumor growth in in vitro and in vivo and can lead to inhibition
of proliferation and induction of cell death [3,
4]. Although its
exact mechanism(s) of action is not clear, this nucleolar protein
can interact with some important functional proteins in
nucleoplasm, such as p53, mouse double minute protein 2
(MDM2), and telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (TRF1), thereby
modulating different fates of the cells [5]. In fact, GTP status of
NS is the key factor in its nucleolar-nucleoplasm recycling and
interaction with nucleoplasmic proteins 
[4–5].

The gene encoding NS is a member of a gene family with an
MMR_HSR1 domain [6]. The MMR_HSR1 domain consists of
five GTP-binding motifs that have been detected in singlecelled
microorganisms to high vertebrates [2]. Among them,
NS and its homologues, guanine nucleotide binding proteinlike
3 (GNL3L) constitute a subfamily of GTP-binding proteins
with a unique domain of circularly permuted GTP-binding
motifs [6]. The chromosomal location of human NS is 3p21.1
with 3 typical transcript variants. The first variant encodes a
protein with 549 amino acids while variants 2 and 3 missed Nterminal
and contain 537 aa [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/26354]. 
Sequence analysis of isoform 1 demonstrated
that the encoded protein has one chain consisting basic (B)
domain (amino acid 2 to 46), intermediate (I) domain (amino
acid 282 to 456), acidic domain (amino acid 456 to 543) and a
coiled coil region (amino acid 56 to 95) 
[5–7]. Functionally, the
nucleolar entry of NS needs GTP binding (G) domain and I
domain whereas its accumulation into nucleolus is dependent
to B domain [7]. Despite these data, however, there is no crystal
(three-dimensional) structure for NS in the literature, offering
an emerging work for predicting its structure by bioinformatics
tolls. In this study we represented a predicted model for target
sequence of NS, particularly its GTP-binding motifs, which may
be helpful for better understanding its functional sites and
subsequently designing therapeutic drugs.

Methodology
Sequence retrieval:
The sequence of human GNL3 in FASTA format was retrieved
from Uniprot Knowledge Base (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BVP2) 
with Q9BVP2 accession number [8].

Disordered residues:
Disordered proteins are a kind of protein that lacks a fixed or
ordered three dimensional structures and therefore cannot be
predicted, so we firstly tried to find which residues of NS can
be potentially disordered through a disorder prediction server
(http://iupred.enzim.hu/).

Sequence alignment and homology modeling:
Different blast algorithms (blastp, PSI-blast and PHI-blast)
were used against Protein Data Bank (PDB) to choose a suitable
template [9]. The template and target sequence were aligned
subsequently using ClustalW with the default parameters.
Finally, the aligned sequence was used as the input for modeler
9.14 to generate a model.

Model refinement:
Predicted models were then refined using Scwrl4 program for
prediction of protein side chain conformations. This program is
based on a new algorithm and new potential function that
result in improved accuracy [10].

Structural validation:
The resulted structure was subjected to structural quality
assessment. The ProsA program was used to assess the energy
of residue-residue interaction using a distance based pair
potential and the energy was transformed to a score called Zscore.
Also, predicted models were assessed with Jcsg [11]
server indexes and the best one was chosen. Moreover, we used
PSVS program for model validation that give results in
PROCHECK [12], MolProbity 
[13], Verify3D 
[14] and ProsaII
plots and graphs.

Secondary structure:
Stride database was used for secondary structure prediction
and computation of α – helical, β – strand and coiled regions
[15].

Domain and motif analysis:
The Pfam database is a large collection of protein families 
[16],
each represented by multiple sequence alignments and hidden
Markov models (HMMs). Pfam results showed one conserved
MMR-HSR1 domain in our query sequence. Amino acid
residues within a domain that occur consistently and are
responsible for specific function are called motifs. They can be
used as fingerprints in evolutionary studies and in assigning a
recently sequenced protein to a particular family. Fingerprint in
our query sequence were found by motif search server
PROSITE [17] and PRINTS 
[18].

Structure visualization:
The predicted model is visualized by vmd software 
[19].

Results &amp; discussion
Although NS plays an important role in physiological and
pathological conditions of stem and cancerous cells, the data on
its structure is insufficient [3–
7]. In a try to predict structure of
NS we engaged bioinformatics tools in this study. The first
issue that should be consider before starting the modeling
process is sequence evaluation of target protein regarding to its
tendency for being disordered. The results in Figure 1A
showed a low disorder tendency in our target sequence while
high tendency was seen in amino acids of 1-131 and 393-549.
After evaluation of disordered residues we started modeling
process. Different blast algorithms were also performed.
Among blast results, the best score belonged to 3CNL chain A
which contains 263 amino acids and had 99% coverage with
amino acids of 132–393 of NS; there was no structural template
with acceptable scores for whole protein at PDB. Although, a
secondary structure prediction for whole NS were performed
via http://cho-fas.sourceforge.net/index.php (data not
shown), we decided to predict our model based on amino acids
132-393 largely because any models predicted from disorder
regions (1-131 and 393-549 aa) may not reliable. In addition, the
functional GTP-binding motifs were found among amino acids
of 132–393. Blast results for target sequence showed 86.7 total
score, 8e-20 E value and 26% identity, meaning that it is proper
for choosing as a template. In the next step, the template and
target sequence were aligned using ClustalW with the default
parameters (Figure 2) and further, the aligned sequence was
used as the input for modeler 9.14 to generate ten (10) models.
After model refinement, different indexes of models were
compared by jcsg database to choose the best one and then
validated with ProsA and PSVS software (Figure 1). The
constructed model is monomer with 263 amino acids; its
molecular weight estimated as 28875 Dalton. The Prosa analysis
showed that Z-score in the predicted model is -2.29, indicating
reasonable side chain interactions (Figure 1B). Ramachandran
Plot from Procheck evaluation for refined model showed 82.6%
residues in allowed regions, 13.0% in additionally allowed
regions and 2.6% in disallowed regions (Figure 1C). Global
quality scores are given in supplementary Tables 1 &amp; 2 (see
supplementary material). In addition, PROCHECK G-factor for
phi-psi and all dihedral angles was performed (Figure 1D &amp; E).
With respect to mean and standard deviation for a set of 252 Xray
structures &lt; 500 residues, of resolution &lt;= 1.80 Å, R-factor
&lt;= 0.25 and R-free &lt;= 0.28; a positive value indicates a ‘better’
score. Results showed no close contacts within 2.2 Å, 2.4 ° RMS
deviation for bond angles and 0.018 Å for RMS deviation for
bond lengths (Figure 1D &amp; E). ProsaII and Verify3D results also
demonstrated that approximately 60% of residues represent a
score over 0.2 which indicate an acceptable model (Figure 1F &amp;G). 
Secondary structure was predicted with Stride database
and analyzed with PSVS (Figure 1H). As depicted from Figure
1H, the predicted secondary structure contains 7 α- helices, 3 β-
strands, a 3- helix and a lot of Turn and Coil structures. In fact,
amino acids 2A-10A, 55A-67A, 137A-144A, 187A-195A, 207A-
221A, 232A-240A, 253A-262A forms α- helices and 15A-19A,
44A-48A, 72A-74A forms β− strands. By contrast, much less β−
sheets were observed in 1-132 and 393-549 regions (data not
shown). Finally, the predicted three-dimensional (3D) structure
was shown in Figure 3A. Motif and domain analysis showed
the conserved MMR-HSR1 domain is located between amino
acids 256-370 where order of GTP-binding motifs is G4 (amino
acids 47-50), G5 (amino acids 75-77), G1 (amino acids 131-138),
G2 (amino acids 157-161) and G3 (amino acids 175-178) in our
model (Figure 3B).

GTP binding sites are good therapeutic targets for drug
designing against GTP-binding proteins. Therefore, the sites of
5 GTP-binding motifs in the predicted model are highly
important and can be considered as valuable targets. Indeed,
GTP-binding is the main mechanism that can control the
functions of NS by its shuttling between nucleolus and
nucleoplasm [5–
7]. For instance, it has been reported that NS
can enter into nucleoplasm to interact with MDM2 and as a
results induce p53-depndent cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis
[4–7]. 
To get more insights on predicted model, we served the
target sequence to corresponding database (http://iupred.enzim.hu/) 
and predicted disorder and anchor tendency in all
residues. Then, we compared given scores for each GTPbinding
motif and calculated the average number of score for
being disorder and ANCHOR (data not shown). The results
presented in Figure S1 showed that G1 and G4 orderly present
the lowest scores (0.11 and 0.18) for being disorder while the
best ANCHOR score belonged to G4 (0.25). Since a higher
ANCHOR score represents a more fixed structure, we proposed
that G4 motif may be more reliable target for drug design.

Collectively, this study represented a general view of NS
structure. Predicted structural model can fit a variety of
applications in future studies including, ligand binding states
and interaction sites as well as screening of databases for
potential lead compounds or inhibitors. It should be mentioned
that our model for target sequence of NS is only a predictive
model and need to be confirmed in further studies.
