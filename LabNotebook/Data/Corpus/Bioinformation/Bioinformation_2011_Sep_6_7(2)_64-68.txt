Background
The genome of the influenza virus contains eight single
stranded negative RNA segments. When two or more different
influenza viruses co-infect the same host cell, newly produced
influenza virus might contain the RNA from a combination of
segments from all the parental strains, so the gene reassortment
is a main drive in influenza evolution. In March and early April
of 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged
in Mexico and United States. In April 2009, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in the United States submitted
the new influenza A (H1N1) virus genome sequence
(A/California/04/2009). Based on each segments homology
analysis respectively, some researchers analyzed the origins of
the novel influenza A H1N1 virus [–
], and drew a conclusion
that this strain might be generated from a triple reassortment of
human, swine and avian viruses. Respective judging each
segment’s origin is useful, but as a matter of fact, some
inaccuracy may occur conditionally. For example, there might
be a judgment that influenza X is re-assorted from Y, but in fact
Y may re-assort from X, or X and Y are just mutation
relationship in evolution. In exploring reassortment evolution
origins of emerging influenza virus, integrated comparing of
the origin sources of all segments is necessary. If some segments
have high homologous with one parental strain, lower
homologous with another parental strain, while other segments
are reverse, we can propose that this emerging influenza virus
may re-assort from the two parental strains. Here we try to
explore the reassortment evolution origin of 2009 H1N1
influenza virus by this strategy.

Materials and Methodology
Sequence data
The accession numbers of influenza A (H1N1) virus in this
study are all obtained from Genbank of NCBI
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and listed in Table 1 (see
). A/California/04/2009(H1N1) comes
from a 10 years old boy in California San Diego of United
States. A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 (H1N1) is the first pandemics
influenza strain, which was recovered from an Alaskan
influenza victim who was buried in 1918 [].
A/Japan/305/1957(H2N2) is a second pandemic strain, which
contains three segments from an avian strain (PB1, HA and NA)
[,
]. A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2) is a third pandemic
strain, which contains two segments from avian viruses (PB1
and HA) [,
]. A/New Jersey/1976(H1N1) was isolated in
United States from an army recruit at Fort Dix in 1976, which
has been considered as a potential pandemics strain 
[].

Homologous analysis
Sequence homologs were searched by NCBI BLAST on
2009.12.22-2009.12.23 from Database: Nucleotide collection
(nr/nt), Optimize for: blastn, Max target, Sequences display:
5000. A homology search was performed for each segment of
influenza virus A/California/07/2009(H1N1) using BLAST,
and the results obtained were combined, compared and
analyzed using EXCEL software. The re-assortment event was
then judged based on the total scores of each BLAST result.
During this process, the virus, which was collected before the
isolate time of A/California/07/2009(H1N1), was chosen. The
virus has a total of 8 segment sequences for further analysis.
Using the same method, three other strains analysis was carried
out. In judging the reassortment strategy, priority search of a
strain that has seven segments high homology with the strain,
and another strain with only one high homology segment were
monitored. If an ideal result cannot be obtained, strains which
have 6 high homology segments and 2 high homology
segments, et al may be explored. If we still cannot get an ideal
result, three strains reassortment may be hypothesized, and
judging its three parental strains by the same way can be
explored. In this study, DNAMAN software Version 5.2
dynamic method was used for two homology calculations.

Results
Reassortment analysis
The eight segments of A/California/07/2009 were analyzed
using blast program, based on the sequence data in GenBank,
and found that it might have come from the reassortment of a
virus strain similar to A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00(H1N2)
and A/swine/England/WVL7/1992 (H1N1). Using the same
method, A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00(H1N2) was analyzed,
and found that it may have come from the reassortment of virus
strain similar to A/Swine/Iowa/533/99 (H3N2) and A/New
Jersey/1976(H1N1), A/swine/England/WVL7/1992(H1N1)
may have come from the reassortment of strain similar to
A/swine/Jamesburg/1942(H1N1) and
A/duck/Germany/1215/1973(H2N3). A/Swine/Iowa/533/99
(H3N2) may have come from the reassortment of strain similar
to A/Turkey/Utah/24721-10/95 (H7N3),
A/Siena/3/1995(H3N2) and
A/swine/California/T9001707/1991(H1N1) (). The
virus strains in  are not the actual reassortment strain.
Before and after the reassortment, some sequence mutations or
re-assortments might occur, since the virus sequences, which
have been submitted to Genbank is only a very small part. The
analysis results can only be considered as a clue for exploring
the origins of a novel virus.

Homology calculation
To further confirm the results, the homology of each segment of
A/California/07/2009(H1N1) with
A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00 (H1N2) and
A/swine/England/WVL7/1992(H1N1) was calculated using
DNAMAN software. Using the same method, the homology of
each segment of A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00 (H1N2),
A/swine/England/WVL7/1992(H1N1) and
A/Swine/Iowa/533/99 (H3N2) was calculated with their
parental strains. (Table 2, see ). The
results further supported our hypothesis. The whole genome
sequence (join to one) was also analyzed by two-pair
comparison (Table 3, see ). From these
results, it is shown A/Siena/3/1995(H3N2) is similar to the
third pandemic influenza strain A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2)
with a homology of 93.63%; A/swine/Jamesburg/1942(H1N1)
is similar to the first pandemic influenza strain A/Brevig
Mission/1/1918(H1N1) with a homology of 95.19%. Based on
these results using this new strategy, it is concluded that this
method provided more accurate information on the source
origin of the influenza virus, indicating that this strategy might
be useful in judging the reassortment origins of newly emerging
influenza virus.

Discussion
Three worldwide pandemic influenza outbreaks occurred in the
20th century on 1918, 1957, and 1968. They are now known to
represent three different antigenic subtypes of influenza A
virus: H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, respectively 
[]. Occasionally,
an Influenza virus from one host can leap into a different host
[]. 
Exploring the rules of influenza gene re-assortment can
allow us to understand the evolution of human Influenza virus
and thus predict the potential future evolution of the newly
emerged viruses. Based on influenza virus sequence analysis,
we hypothesized the evolution origins of the novel influenza
virus. We also postulated that the first pandemic influenza
strain changed to a strain similar to
A/swine/Jamesburg/1942(H1N1), and then re-assorted with
avain influenza virus strain similar to
A/duck/Germany/1215/1973(H2N3). A new H1N1 strain
similar to A/swine/England/WVL7/1992 (H1N1) emerged
thereafter. The third pandemic influenza strain similar to
A/Siena/3/1995 (H3N2) re-assorted with swine H1N1 strain
and avian influenza strain, then a H3N2 strain similar to
A/Swine/Iowa/533/99 (H3N2) emerged, and it re-assorted
with A/New Jersey/1976 (H1N1) similar strain, which is a
potential pandemic strain in 1976, and then a H1N2 strain
similar to A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00(H1N2) emerged.
A/Swine/Indiana/P12439/00 similar strain may re-assort with
A/swine/England/WVL7/1992 similar strain, leading to the
emergence of 2009 novel H1N1 influenza. Nowadays, with the
increasing contact of human-avian, human-swine, swine-avian
and with the bulk production of influenza vaccine, the gene
reassortment possibility increases. In recent years, the genomic
sequence data for thousands of available influenza A virus
strains have been submitted to Genbank. These sequences have
been isolated all around the world during the past years. Using
the information in these databases, we may better understand
the evolution of the viruses. Thus, the Origins of 2009 Influenza
A (H1N1) virus were analysed based on total segments
homology analysis, indicating that this strategy may be useful
in judging the origin of a newly emerging influenza virus.
