Background
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which
deals with the construction and evaluation of algorithms that
expedite pattern recognition, classification and prediction based
on models derived from existing data []. Sophisticated
machine learning algorithms (MLA) have also been attempted
[] on biological aspects. These utilize techniques such as neural
networks [], logistic regression 
[] and support vector
machines (SVM) []. SVM as a supervised machine learning
technology is attractive because it has an extremely well
developed statistical learning theory [,
]. SVM is currently the
best performers for a number of classification tasks ranging
from text to genomic data. It has been gradually applied to
protein secondary structure prediction [], tumor cell prediction
and DNA binding residues prediction [] and many more
pattern classification problems in biology related areas.
Recently [] SVM has been used as a new and promising
technique for detecting DNA binding site prediction for TF
proteins.

SVM based [,
,
] method for binding site prediction
depend on the sequence [] and structure characteristics or
both [] of known protein binding sites. These characteristics
such as sequence conservation [], interface propensities 
[,
], the charge or dipole moment of the protein molecule, the
presence of positively charged surface patches, secondary
structure [], accessible surface area 
[], 3D motifs 
[] and
residue evolutionary information [] are applied to train a set
of data's for model generation.

The helix turn helix (HTH) motif is a major structural DNA
binding motif. It is composed of two α-helices joined by short
strand of amino acid and is found in many proteins that
regulate gene expression []. The two α helices of tri-helical
HTH motif, one occupying the N-terminal end and the other
occupying the C-terminal end of the helix are involved in
recognition and binding to the DNA []. The third helix is
known as the recognition helix which has prime role in
establishing the contacts with DNA major groove. The
positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids residing in the
third helix increase the bonding capacity in DNA-protein
complexes [,
]. A very large class of transcription factors
can be classified as HTH motif type of family according to
Interpro database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/).

In the present work, the characteristic features of interaction
sites of DNA-binding proteins with HTH motif from the
residue level were analyzed. The four sequence features include
the evolutionary sequence conservation, positively charged
residues, H-bond donor and acceptor residues and hydrophobic
residues. A SVM based model was trained with 90 sequences
(training set) using the above sequence features for the
prediction of DNA-binding residues in HTH motif type of
proteins. The total dataset was selected for training and test was
136 sequences and three fold cross validation was also done on
the training set to get an average value of accuracy, sensitivity
and specificity.

Methodology
Dataset selection:
Sequence data set was retrieved from NCBI
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), 91 proteins (TFs) with HTH
motif and 45 protein sequences without HTH motif of
eukaryotes were collected. All these selected proteins are
having DNA binding domain with HTH motif which was
verified by Pfam database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) 
[].
Out of 136 total protein sequences 90 sequences were chosen
randomly as training set and others as test set so that the ¾ of
the total will remain as training set and ¼ as test set.

Features selection for training and test data sets:
After the determination of crystal structures of C1 and Cro
repressor proteins from bacteriophage lambda [], the DNA
binding HTH structural motif [] has become one of the most
important and studied examples of the interaction between
proteins and DNA. The typical length of the HTH motif is
around 25 residues. DNA interaction site was predicted
through ScanProsite [] available at
http://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/. It was found that this
site mainly compose of the maximum portion of HTH motif
 (see supplementary material). For non HTH motif
sequences interaction site with different motifs were found.

On the basis of these observations four features were chosen in
this work for the interaction site. These are evolutionary
sequence conservation, positively charged residues, H-bond
donor/acceptor and hydrophobic residues ().
Conservation of residues was determined from multiple
sequence analysis []. From the MSA result it was evident that
in five columns (out of 25) the conservation score was very
high. Thus, conditional probability was applied to find the
value of each residue situated in that position. The value was
calculated by,

P (AB) = P (A) P (B/A) (1)

Where A represents the column number to be selected and B
represents the residue to be in that column.

As per many studies of DNA-protein interaction [,
,
] the
positively charges residues shows more prone of binding
capacity with negatively charged residues of DNA strand. Side
chain groups of positively charged residues as arginine,
histidine and lysine within the interaction site were assumed to
be capable of getting involved in H-bonding during the
interaction [,
]. Asparagine, arginine, glutamine, cysteine,
histidine, serine, threonine, tryptophan and tyrosine were
calculated as the H-bond donor, while aspartic acid and
glutamic acid were calculated as the H-bond acceptor. The
values were calculated and noted down for each feature. So,
altogether four features were used as attributes for modeling
the SVM classifier from the residue level of amino acids.

SVM implementation:
The freely downloadable LIBSVM package was used for the
implementation of SVM [] with MATLAB interface. The
widely used Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel was used. In
the present study our training and testing dataset was verified
by simulating it in Matlab 7.0, Microsoft Windows 2007
Operating System and Intel Pentium D-2.80 GHz with 2 GM of
Random Access Memory (RAM).

Web page designing:
The concerned web page based on above selected SVM model
has a simple user interface. It contains an input field where user
can paste the FASTA format protein sequence. There is also a
provision of uploading text file with protein sequence. The web
page also gives a brief description of our model. The overall
web page was designed in HTML codes with different color
combination and pictures incorporated in it (). When
the user enters the data in the form, these values are passed to
the matlab engine. Once the matlab engine is ready, matlab
code is executed from within the java environment.

Results &amp; Discussion
Goal of the work was to characterize the interaction site in HTH
motif as well as non-HTH motif of TF proteins and train the
model based on SVM approach. The accuracy of the model was
also checked and verified with existing models.

In this work a set of features were selected, studied and applied
to distinguish the interaction site with non-interaction site. The
interaction site of HTH motif and non HTH motif was retrieved
from ScanProsite result. The outcome presents the type of motif,
its length, interaction site with DNA and its length ().
DNA interaction site identified by ScanProsite mainly constitute
of a large portion of HTH motif. The total length of the HTH
motif was approximately 20 to 25 residues long.

Due to the much specified selection criteria of the samples, the
total data set used for the study were 136 which is a pretty small
in size. But in spite of fewer samples the k-fold cross validation
resampling technique was employed for training and testing of
the classifier for the selected features. Considering the k=3, the
whole dataset was randomly divided into three parts. Each an
every parts represent the same proportion (approximately) as in
the original data set. The procedure was repeated for total 3
times where two parts of the data was selected as training set
and one part as test set. For all 3 fold confusion matrix was
generated by the LIBSVM , 
 &amp; 
 (see
supplementary material).

Three performance matrixes were averaged to obtain an overall
estimate of the classifier performance. Parallel with SVM
approach the Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and K-nearest
neighbor (KNN) method was also applied for comparative
studies. The prediction outcome was classified and counted for
the methods. Consistent with all other references [,
] the
performance criteria used are accuracy  (see
supplementary material), sensitivity  (see
supplementary material) and specificity  (see
supplementary material). These are defined as follows:

Accuracy = TP+TNv(TP=TN=FP=FN)
Specificity=TN/(TN+FP)
Sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN)

The numbers of true positive, true negative, false positive and
false negative results are indicated by TP, TN, FP and FN
respectively, and were calculated from the following confusion
matrixes. The TP, TN, FP and FN are defined as follows: TP =
Correct positive predictions / Total positives; FP = Incorrect
negative predictions / Total negatives; TN = Correct negative
predictions / Total negative; FN = Incorrect positive predictions
/ Total positive.

The above tables of accuracy  (see supplementary
material), sensitivity  (see supplementary material) and
specificity  (see supplementary material) indicate that
our model is showing the best result with average accuracy of
94.19%. Here we showed that this SVM model can predict
interaction sites (DNA-binding residues) at 96.7% sensitivity
and 89.16% specificity. The result of our study suggest that this
SVM – based approach can be used as a good prediction tool for
HTH motif type of interaction studies. In view of the previous
knowledge [], four web servers are available at the moment
for sequence-based prediction of DNA-binding sites: DBSPRED
[], DBS-PSSM 
[], BindN 
[] and DP-Bind 
[].Our
performance measures are higher than those reported by these
four studies.

Conclusion
In this work, we have described a new SVM-based approach for
prediction of binding sites within HTH motif based on amino
acid sequence data. The present work is the 1st SVM-based
method for HTH motif interaction site prediction till date. The
average accuracy of this work is 94.19%, which is a pretty good
value for prediction purpose. K-fold cross re-sampling
technique was used for validation. The sensitivity (96.7%) and
specificity (89.16%) shows that this SVM – based approach can
be used as a good prediction tool for HTH motif type of
interaction studies. The output result of our model shows two
outcomes in the web page. If HTH motif is present in the query
protein, then interaction site is predicted otherwise, there is no
prediction. In the future, prediction tool for other types of
motifs can be developed as well.
