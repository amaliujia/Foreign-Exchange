Background
Sperata aor, a freshwater, demersal, potamodromous cat fish 
[,
], hosts two 
ancylodiscoidins Thaparocleidus and Cornudiscoides,
distributed from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh upto upper
Myanmar. So far, three oioxenous species of the genus
Thaparocleidus had been reported from S. aor., T. aori (Rizvi,
1971) Lim, 1996; T. mystusi (Rizvi, 1971) Lim, 1996 and T.
speratai Agrawal et al., 2004. An unknown species T. susanae
n.sp. was collected along with T. aori and their morphology as
well as molecular data were analyzed. Their phylogenetic
analysis had been done along with 14 species (sequences
retrieved from GenBank) from China, the neighboring country
to ascertain their relationship. Max identity between obtained
sequences of Thaparocleidus is 87% (on line BLAST: Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) set at default value.

Methodology
Fishes were collected from River Gomti at Lucknow. Live hosts
were also bought from fish markets and maintained in glass
aquaria. Hosts were identified by Fishbase []. Gills of freshly
dead hosts were examined fresh as well as fixed (3% formaline
diluted with lukewarm water). Parasites were dislodged with
micro needles in glass petri-dishes and studied under a phase
contrast microscope (Olympus BX 51). The methods for
staining, mounting and illustrating the dactylogyrids were as
described by Kritsky et al., [] and numbering of hooks was that
of Kulweic []. Measurements were taken in µm using a
calibrated micrometer following the procedure and terminology
of Gusev []; means are followed by the range and the number
(n) of specimens measured in parentheses. Unstained Glycerine
mounts, sealed with sealant, were used for measurements of
soft as well as hard parts. Measurements and illustrations were
made with the help of an image taken with camera (Olympus-
Photometrics coolsnap) attached with microscope, using Image-
ProExpress 6.0 (for image analysis).

Molecular analysis:
DNA isolation:
Single parasite was collected in absolute ethanol for DNA
extraction. Total DNA was extracted from the collected parasite
using Qiagen's Dneasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Cat. No. 69504) by
following protocol as per DNA extraction kit with slight
modifications.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR):
Partial 28S rDNA region of T. aori and T. susanae. sp. was
amplified in an Eppendorf Master Cycler Personal (PCR
machine: Polymerase chain reaction machine) using forward
(5'ACCCGCTGAATTTAAGCAT-3') and
reverse(5'CTCTTCAGAGTACTTTTCAAC-3') primers. The
reaction volume was 25µl, (PCR) buffer (10X), 0.5µl dNTPs
(10mM), 0.5µl forward primer (19.6 nMol.), 0.5µl reverse primer
(31.9 nMol.), 0.5µl Taq polymerase (5 Units), 1µlMgCl2 (25mM)
5µl genomic DNA and 15µl miliQ water. PCR conditions were
95°C for 4 min (initial denaturation), followed by 35 cycles of
95°C for 1 min (denaturation), 55°C for 45 sec (annealing), 72
C for 1 min (extension) and 72°C for 10 min (final extension).
PCR products were checked on 1.5 % agarose gels in TAE
buffer stained with ethidium bromide (EtBr) and visualized
under UV light. Amplicons were sequenced with the same
primers using automated sequencer (Inst Model/Name:
3730xl/SYNGENE-373XL/-140362-004 of Applied Biosystems).

Data analysis:
Sequencing products were subjected to BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) for homology search. Multiple
sequence alignment was performed using Clastal W 
[]. The
sequence of query species (T. susanae n. sp. and T. aori) was
compared with retrieved sequences  (see
supplementary material) to infer phylogenetic relationship
among them. Sequence data (obtained /retrieved) were
analyzed using minimum evolution and neighbor- joining
methods of MEGA 5 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics
Analysis-5 [] for generating phylogenetic tree among them.
The robustness of the inferred phylogeny was assessed using
bootstrap value at 1,000 replications. Genetic relatedness among
the analyzed monogenes is due to conserved as well as identical
regions. Sequence (partial 28S rDNA) of T. susanae n. sp. and T.
aori were submitted to Genbank under accession numbers
KC962228 and KC962227 respectively.

Remarks:
This species was characterized by structure of copulatory
complex having a pointed “angle” shaped accessory piece,
attached distaly to a copulatory tube with three clockwise coiles
and long vaginal tube having a funnel like, lightly sclerotised
opening. The present species resemblse with T. mystusi in
comparative morphology of vaginal apparatus, dorsal anchors,
dorsal bar and hooks but differs in the structure of copulatory
complex, copulatory tube without coiling and accessory piece
being pitcher shaped, also the ventral bar is longer, its middle
region being fine and thin in T. mystusi which was smaller and
of same width throughtout its length in T. susanae n. sp.
Similarly, the ventral anchor has a sharp and pointed inner root
end in T. mystusi while in T. susanae n. sp the two roots are
short, pointed and of almost smiliar length. It also resembles
with T. speratai in comparative morphology of vaginal
apparatus, ventral bar and hooks but chiefly differs in the
structure of copulatory complex which had single, horse shoe
shaped accessery piece attached diataly to copulatory tube. It
also differs from T. aori in the structure of copulatory complex,
vaginal armature, ventral anchors, ventral bar, dorsal bar and
dorsal anchor. Therefore this species, regarded as a new species,
named in honour of Prof. L. H. S. Lim, for her outstanding
contributions.

Remark:
Rizvi [] described 
T. aori from S. aor as A. aori form Sind;
Pakistan. Later on Gusev [] described it as S. aori with three
forms (one typical form and two atypical forms) and transferred
it under genus Silurodiscoides Gusev, 1976 (focued on hard parts
only). Lim [] considered 
A. aori and S. aori as junior subjective
synomyms of Thaparocleidus Jain, 1952. We have recorded the
species briefly with addition of egg strcuture.

Discussion
In monogenes sequences of ribosomal subunits were widely
used to infer phylogenetic relationships at the level of families
and sub families [–] 
and also to investigate evolutionary
association between the parasites and their hosts 
[,
].

In the present study, phylogenetic analysis using 28S genes
showed a well resolved grouping of two Indian species of the
genus Thaparocleidus under study and 14 from China. In 
() 
shows the phylogenetic relatedness and evolutionary
pattern of 16 species of the genus Thaparocleidus and three
species of Dactylogyrus, using Neighbour-joining method and
Minimum Evolution method of MEGA5. They probably
originated from same ancestor, forming two clusters and
Dactylogyrus as an out group. Further, cluster “A” had two
lineages for the genus Thaparocleidus. Lineage one includes T.
mutabilis, T. sp. NY1, T. omegavagina, T. sp. 2 XW, T.
cochleavagina, T. magnicirrus, T. obscura, T. infundibulovagina, T.
varicus, T. sp. 1 XW, T. sp. NY2, T. asoti, T. sp. BDY, T.
campylopterocirrus (all from China) and lineage two includes T.
aori and T.susanae n.sp. (from India), while cluster “B” had D.
petruschewskyi, D. lamellatus, D. inversus (from China/Iran).
Hence molecular analysis also revealed inter-species
differences, further confirming their validity, earlier based on
conventional morphological studies.
