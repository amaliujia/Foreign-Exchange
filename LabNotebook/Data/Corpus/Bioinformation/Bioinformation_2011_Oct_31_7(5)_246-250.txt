Background:
The Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are 
profoundly used in the treatment of a wide variety of 
inflammation conditions. They exhibit their effect by inhibiting 
cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. The enzyme is involved in the 
biosynthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclins and thromboxanes 
from arachidonic acid  []. It has been shown recently that the 
COX enzyme exists in three isoforms: COX-1, COX-2 and COX-
3. COX-1 isoform is expressed constitutively and believed to 
play a role in physiological process such as gastroprotection 
and vascular homeostasis, COX-2 isoform in its inducible form 
is associated with inflammation [], whereas COX-3 isoform has 
no importance in the development of inflammation  [,
]. The 
first two COX isoforms are about 60% homologues. Despite the 
great similarity in the sequence data, detailed examination of 
structure of the catalytic sites revealed the substrate binding 
channel in the two enzymes to be quite different. A single 
amino acid change, from the comparatively bulky isoleucine in 
COX-1 to valine at position 523 in COX-2,  and the 
conformational changes it produces, resulted in enhanced 
access to a ‘side pocket’ that allowed the binding of COX-2 
specific inhibitors by providing a docking site for bulky 
phenylsulfonamide residue of drugs such as SC-558 [,
]. The 
classical NSAIDs produce their adverse effects via inhibition of 
COX-1 isoform, hence many investigations have been directed 
to find compounds able to act as selective COX-2 inhibitors. The 
COX inhibitors such as celecoxib, valdecoxib and rofecoxib 
selectively inhibit COX-2 isoenzyme and clinically effective
anti-inflammatory agents with less gastrointestinal and renal 
toxicity. However, there is now convincing evidence that higly 
selective COX-2 inhibitors alter the balance in the COX pathway 
resulting in decrease in the level of vasodilatory and 
antiaggregatory prostacyclin (PGI2), relative to an increase in the 
level of the prothrombotic thromboxane (TxA2), leading to 
increase incidences of an adverse cardiovascular thrombotic 
event such as myocardial infarction [,
]. Thus, there is still a 
need for novel, selective, and potent COX-2 inhibitors with an 
improved profile, compared to current COX-2 inhibitors based 
on structural templates modification. The majority of COX-2 
inhibitors are diarylheterocycles. A –SO3CH3 or a- SO2NH2  
substituent at the para-position of phenyl ring was essential for 
optimum COX-2 selectivity and inhibitory potency. However, 
heterocycles ring system can be used a wide variety of 
heterocycles, in general a five membered or six membered  ring 
[]. 
Some of quinazolin-4-one derivatives have been synthesized 
and evaluated to discover more potent and tolerable 
antiinflammatory agent and reported to exhibit mild COX-2 
inhibition and anti-inflammatory activity [,
]. Traditional 
synthesis of new quinazolin-4-one derivatives and bioactivity 
evaluation can be carried out for optimization activity. 
However, those processes are of high cost and also time 
consuming. On the other hand, screening of the small molecules 
of novel compounds represents an alternative process. Docking 
various ligands to the protein of interest followed by scoring to 
determine the binding affinity and to reveal the strength of 
interaction has become extensively used in virtual screening of 
large databases and lead optimization 
[–]. We report 
screening of various 2,3-disubstituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones 
possessing benzenesulfonamide moiety bound directly or 
indirectly to ring system against the COX-2 enzyme extracted 
from protein data bank, by utilizing the Protein-Ligand ANT 
System (PLANTS) v1.1 docking software []. Various 
molecular structures of the ligands were docked and scored to 
identify the ligands that bind similar to reference ligand  
binding for COX-2 and to estimate the ligands binding affinity 
for its target. The molecular properties of the docked ligands 
were also to be analyzed to predict the oral bioavailability of the 
ligands.

Methodology:
Preparation of Target Protein X-ray Structure:
The crystal structure of murine COX-2 in complex with SC-558 
inhibitor (PDB code: 6COX, 
http://www.pdb.org/) 
[] was 
selected as the protein target model in this virtual screening 
study. Using YASARA software [] hydrogens were added 
and enzyme structure was subjected to a refinement protocol in 
which the constraints on the enzyme were gradually removed, 
and converted into SYBYL mol2 format. The crystal structures 
of human COX-2 bound to 4 ligands were solved in 2010 and 
publicly available (PDB code: 3LN0, 3LN1, 3MQE, 3NTG) []. 
Nonetheless, we used the structure in PDB ID: 6COX for further 
analysis and experiment.

Ligands Preparation:
The various structures of 2,3-disubstituted 4(3H)-
quinazolinones possessing benzensulfonamide moiety bound 
directly or indirectly to the ring system, were drawn and 
prepared for docking using Chemaxon's Marvin software 
(http://www.chemaxon.com) 
[]  
(, see supplementry 
materials). The ligands for docking input were prepared using
combination of 10 conformations structure and converted into 
SYBYL mol2 format.

Protein-Ligand Docking:
The docking of the target protein with the ligand was 
performed using the PLANTS v1.1  docking software 
(
http://www.tcd.uni-konstanz.de/research/plants.php).  The 
docking algorithm PLANTS is based on a class of stochastic 
optimization algorithms called ant colony optimization (ACO) 
with empirical scoring function (PLANTSCHEMPLP). The docking 
tool generated 10 conformation for each docked ligand. The 
goal of this docking is to find a low energy ligand conformation 
in the protein's binding site []. The virtual screening 
technique employed in this study was identifying the ligands 
that bind in comparable manner similar to SC-558 (reference 
ligand) binding for COX-2. YASARA v10.1.8 software was 
utilized to visualize molecular  docked poses. Before screening 
the ligands, the docking protocol was validated by redocking 
SC-558 ligand into it's binding pocket within the COX-2 crystal 
to obtain the docked pose and RMSD. The result showed that 
the first ranked cluster contained 10 conformations in the same 
orientation within the binding site, and the RMSD of the first 
conformation of the ligands with respect to reference ligand 
was 1.3758 Å. Thus, the protocol is good in reproducing the 
Xray crystal structure in complex forms for further docking 
experiments.

Lipinski's Rule of 5 Screening:
Lipinski's rule of 5 is widely implemented to analyze the 
“druglikeness” of the proposed ligand. It states that poor absorption 
or permeation are more likely when a ligand molecule violates
these rules. []. 
The properties of the ligands are calculated for 
the screening using Chemaxon's Marvin software 
[].

Results and Discussion:
The protein-ligand interaction score values obtained during 
docking (total PLANTSCHEMPLP score values), the  docked poses 
obtained from visualization, and the properties of the ligands 
are given in   (see supplementry material). In general, 
the obtained scores  are in between ­61.491 and ­101.373, except 
compound 7c (­13.576). As a comparison, the PLANTSCHEMPLP 
score obtained for SC-558  and celecoxib were ­75.3077 and ­
67.7373 respectively. All the ligands docked deeply within the 
binding pocket region suggest their shape complimentarity 
with COX-2. However, only 16 of the ligands (50.0%) make 
docking pose similar to SC-558 satisfying Lipinski's rule of five.  
The molecular weight of the molecules are in between 377.08 to 
448.12 with ClogP value between 2.33 to 3.62, hydrogen bond 
donor between 1 to 2 and hydrogen bond acceptor between 4 to 
6. This results indicate that the above mentioned molecules are 
predicted to be orally bioavailable. SC-558 is a diaryl 
heterocyclic inhibitor with a 1,900-fold selectivity for COX-2 
over COX-1. It has a central pyrazole ring and a sulfonamide 
substituent bound to one of the aryl rings []. The crystal 
structure of COX-2 with SC-558 (S-58 in YASARA) reveals that 
the bromophenyl ring of SC-558 is bound in a hydrophobic 
cavity formed by Phe381, Tyr385, Trp387, Phe518, Met522, 
Val523, Ala527 and Ser530 and the trifluoromethyl group of the 
pyrazole ring binds in an adjacent pocket formed by Met113, 
Val116, Arg120, Val349, Tyr355, Leu359 dan Leu531. The 
benzenesulfonamide moiety extends into a relatively polar 
region and interacts with  His90, Gln192, Leu352, and Ser353.
One of H-atoms of SO2NH2 forms  hydrogen bond interaction to 
the backbone carbonyl oxygen (OE1) of Gln192 (distance ≈ 2.1 
Å). The second H-atoms of SO2NH2 is positioned about 3.48 Å 
from the nitrogen (NE2) of His90. The distance between O-atoms 
of SO2NH2 and the NH group of Phe518  is about  2.76 Å. The 
second O-atoms of SO2NH2 
is positioned about 3.15 Å from the 
NH2 (guanidino group) of Arg513 (). The latest 
mentioned interaction is in line with previously published 
study []. All of 2,3-disubstituted-4(3)-quinazolinone 
compounds possessing  p-benzenesulfonamide moiety at C-2 
and  phenyl  ring  at  N-3  directly  or  indirectly  bound  to  ring 
system are oriented in a similar way to that of SC-558. 
Accordingly, the compounds possess  m-benzenesulfonamide 
moiety at C-2 (62.5%),  p-benzenesulfonamide moiety at N-3  
(25.0%) and m-benzenesulfonamide moiety at N-3 (12.5%). The 
docked pose of compound 3d and 7d are presented in 
and  . The molecules of compound 3d and compound 7d 
occupied all the three pocket regions and similar binding 
modes as observed with SC-558. The phenylamino group at N-3 
and the p-benzenesulfonamide moiety at C-2 of the quinazolin-
4-one ring of compound 3d, and the unsubstituted phenyl ring 
at N-3 and  p-[(E)-2-ethenyl]benzenesulfonamide moiety at C-2 
of the quinazolin-4-one ring of compound 7d are oriented 
towards  p-bromophenyl group and the  p-benzenesulfonamide 
moiety of the SC-558, respectively. While the A ring of 
quinazolin-4-one is oriented towards the trifluromethyl group
of the pyrazole ring of the SC-558.  The majority of interacting 
residues of SO2NH2 of compound 3d and 7d are similar with 
those  of SC-558. One of them is Arg513. This is in line with 
previously published study [].  Compound  3d  forms 
hydrogen bond interaction between its H-atoms of SO2NH2 with
carbonyl oxygen (OE1) of Gln192 (distance  ≈ 2.37 Å). The 
second   H-atoms of SO2NH2 is positioned about 3.31 Å from 
carbonyl oxygen of Phe518.  The distance between O-atoms of  
SO2NH2 and NH group (HE2) of Gln192 is about 3,37 Å. The 
second  O-atoms  of    SO2NH2 
is positioned about 3.39 Å from 
NH2 (guanidino group) of Arg513. Compound 7d form 
hydrogen bond interaction between its  O-atoms of SO2NH2
with NH group of Phe518 (distance ≈  1.53  Å).  The  second   
O-atoms of SO2NH2 
is positioned about 3.61 Å from NH group of 
Arg513. The distance between H-atoms of SO2NH2 and nitrogen 
(NE2) of His90 is about 2.64 Å. The other H-atoms of SO2NH2 is 
positioned about 3.71 Å from carbonyl oxygen of Arg513. The 
distance between O-atoms of quinazolinone ring (compound 3d 
and 7d) and OH group of Ser530 are about 5.27 and 5.12 Å, 
respectively. The interaction between the ligand with Ser530 is 
important for inhibition of COX-2 by several compounds 
besides aspirin [], and it was suggested to be considered in 
compounds optimization for COX-2 inhibitor [].

Conclusion:
Thirty two molecular structures of 2,3-disubstituted-4(3H)-
quinazolinones possessing benzenesulfonamide moiety bound 
directly or indirectly to the ring system have been docked and 
scored to identify the ligands that bind similar orientation as 
observed with SC-558 binding for COX-2. The result show that 
2,3-disubstituted-4(3H)-quinazolinones possessing  
pbenzenesulfonamide moiety at C-2 and phenyl ring at N-3 
showed equal to higher binding  affinity than that of SC-558 
with similar orientation to SC-558 ligand. The majority of 
interacting residues of SO2NH2  of compound  3d and  7d are 
similar with those of SC-558. The  O-atoms of quinazolinone 
ring have the potential to interact with Ser530 satisfying 
Lipinski's rule of five. These compounds could be considered as 
potent COX-2 inhibitors.
