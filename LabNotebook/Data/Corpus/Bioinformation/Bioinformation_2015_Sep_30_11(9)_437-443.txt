to rich source of medicinally important secondary metabolites. Bioactive compounds from natural sources are gaining importance
as potential drug candidates towards many inflammatory conditions like Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The focus of the present
study has been centred to reveal the anti-inflammatory potential of an underutilized fruits of B. sapida. Further efforts towards its
medicinal significance may provide relieve from symptoms of RA by reducing the side effects that are observed in available
medications. Total 10 compounds in fruit crude methanol extract were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS analysis followed
by the agar well diffusion method for their anti microbial activity. Among all studied micro organism S. aureus was found to
surmount the inflammation in RA through domain B of surface protein A (Staphylococcal surface protein A). Identified
compounds (having anti-inflammatory properties) were scrutinized for their toxicity and quantitative structure–activity
relationship (QSAR) using lazer toxicity and Molinspiration servers respectively. Further, docking studies have been carried out
between domain B and studied compounds using AutoDock. Out of 6 anti-inflammtory compounds, quercetin has been identified
as the most potent compound in reference to its inhibitory constant (47.01) and binding energy (-5.90 kcal/mol) to bacterial protein.
Our data suggest that methanol extract of B. sapida fruit posses medicinally significant anti-inflammatory compounds and thus
justifies the use of this fruit as folklore medicine for preventing inflammation related diseases.

Background
Baccaurea sapida (syn. Baccaurea ramiflora), commonly known as
Kusum, belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family that grows in
the eastern sub-Himalayan tract. This fruit has been put into the
category of underutilized fruit among 675 wild, edible fruits 
[1]
and harvested during the months of May to July. Underutilized
fruits, vegetables and grains are non-commodity crops which
are quite popular among farmers but have been neglected
by the users for a variety of agronomic, genetic, economic,
social and cultural factors [2]. The bark, roots and wood are
harvested for medicinal uses and is also used to treat arthritis,
abscesses, injuries and skin diseases [3]. The pulp of B. sapida is
a good source of vitamin C and the fruit juice is used to treat
constipation and is used to make wine and stewed [4]. Recent
study has reported anti-inflammatory action of B. ramiflorai leaf
through romarinic acid that inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis
[5]. A significant increase in the production of tropical exotic
fruit has been observed in market due to the presence
of bioactive compounds and attractive sensory properties 
[6].
Therefore, lighting up the medicinal properties of such
underutilized fruits can be a good attempt to enhance the
utilization and for health benefits in inflammatory conditions
such as RA. Basically, RA is a heterogenic, auto-immune
disease of joints which ultimately leads to the loss of function
[7]. Available treatments for RA are disease modifying anti
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and non-steroidal anti
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but these drugs only control the
symptoms such as pain and stiffness [8]. In spite of this, these
drugs have some side effects such as gastrointestinal problems,
elevated risk of damage to the retina of the eyes [9], diarrhea
[10]. Therefore, investigation continues for alternative products
and natural phytochemicals from plants origin used as
traditional medicines. Studies have reported that consumption
of fruits and vegetables is related with a decreased risk of
cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and various factors
associated with ageing [11–15].

Thus, in the present communication we have characterized
medicinal importance, phytochemical constituents and studied
antimicrobial potential of B. sapida fruits. During the
characterization, we have quantified and identified 10
compounds having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties. Salicylic acid, Sinapic acid, Quercetin, Myricetin, pcoumaric
acid and Chorogenic acid are selected for further
study on the basis of their anti-inflammatory properties.
Bacteria (against which anti microbial activity was observed)
were analysed for the presence of surface protein having role in
pathogenesis of RA. Among all studied bacteria S. aureus was
found as potent instigator of RA via its domain B of surface
protein A. Surface proteins of bacteria are found to be
associated with pathogenesis of various diseases including RA
[16]. Staphylococcal protein A of Staphylococcus aureus played
an important role in the progression of RA [17–20]. This protein
helps S. aureus in survival and virulence by adhering it to host
cell that ultimately leads to various arthritic symptoms 
[21].
Inhibition of protein A function will inhibit bacterial host
interaction, hence may suppress the symptoms of the disease.
Therefore, analysed six compounds were docked against the
protein A to check their potentiality to inhibit this protein.

However, there is no scientific justification of traditional use of
B. sapida in the treatment of RA. Hence, present work was
under taken to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of B.
sapida.

Methodology
Plant materials:
The fruits of B. sapida were collected from local market of
kalimpong, West Bengal, India during May-July and
authenticated at by Dr. H.B. Singh at National Institute of
Science Communication and Information Resources, Council of
Scientific and Industrial Research, Delhi, India.

Extraction:
Fresh fruit sample (100g) was crushed partially and solvent
extracted with Methanol (MeOH). The filtrate were filtered
through whatman filter paper and evaporated at low
temperature. After evaporation of organic solvents, the extract
yields were calculated and the extract was stored at 4°C till
further analyses.

Quantification of polyphenols by LC-MS/MS:
The polyphenols were analyzed by the chromatographic
system consisting of an Agilent 1100 series HPLC instrument
equipped with 6460 triple quad MS detector [22]. Analytical
separations of the extracts were carried out on a C18 column
(4.6 mm×100 mm×5 µm, Agilent Technology) at a flow rate of
0.8 /min, with a two solvent mobile phase (eluent A=10
mMammonium acetate and 1 % acetic acid in water; eluent B=
1 % acetic acid in methanol). The gradient elution was carried
out as follows: 0-3 min, 15-50 % A; 3-5.5 min, 50-90 % A; 5.5-9
min, 90 % A; 9-9.5 min, 90-15 % A; 9.5-10 min, 15 % A. The
sample injection volume was 20 µL. The fragmentation was
done in ESI-MS/MS (Agilent Jet stream) in negative ionization
mode. Data was acquired and quantified by Agilent triple quad
LC-MS Mass Hunter work station based on external
standardization by employing calibration curves in the range of
1-50 ng/ based on the peak area calculated from selected ion
chromatograms of the corresponding [M-H]− ion. Results were
expressed in µg per 100 mg extract.

Antimicrobial assay:
Antimicrobial activities of the extracts were tested by agar well
diffusion method [23] against Gram-positive bacteria and
Gram-negative bacteria (Figure 1). Minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MICs) were determined through a standard
two-fold micro-dilution technique. Tests were performed in
sterile flat-bottom 96-well microplates (Difco Laboratories,
Detroit, USA) by maintaining a constant volume (200µL/tube)
for serial dilutions of extracts. The MICs were expressed in
mg/ml extract and were defined as the lowest extract
concentration for which the optical density of a well was null.
Tetracycline was used as positive control.

Docking studies
Preparing target molecule:
To explore the interaction of identified bioactive compounds,
NMR spectroscopic structure of domin B of Staphylococcal
protein A (PDB ID: 1BDC) was obtained from the Protein Data
Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) and energy was minimized
using Swiss PDB viewer (SPDBV).

Ligand characterization:
Total six bioactive compounds namely quercetin, myricetin,
salycylic acid, sinapic acid, chlorogenic acid and p-coumaric
acid have been identified in the present studies for their anti
inflammatory properties. These compounds were downloaded
from PUBCHEM (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
PADEL web server was used to reveal the 2D descriptors
describing the pharmacophore of the obtained ligands. The
Chemistry Development Kit is utilized to calculate these
descriptors and fingerprints [24]. Lethal toxicity of these
compounds was scrutinized by lazar toxicity prediction server
(http://lazar.in-silico.de/predict) on both cell based models
and animal models involving Rat, Mouse and Hamster [25].
Molinspiration web server (http://www.molinspiration.com/
cgi-bin/properties) builds local QSAR (quantitative structure−
activity relationship) models for every ligand to be predicted.

Molecular Docking:
Grid and docking parameter files were prepared using ADT
and molecular docking was performed with AutoDock 4.2.1. In
order to analyze the effect of ligand association, all the water
molecules and the hetero atoms have been removed from the
target protein. All the hydrogen atoms were added to the
protein as it is required for the electrostatics and then non polar
hydrogen atoms were merged together. Gasteiger charges were
assigned to ligands and save them into PDBQT file format. 3D
grid box comprising the interacting motif was constructed with
122×82×70 Å dimension and 0.386 Å spacing. Blind docking has
been carried out fifty times to predict the highly interacting
residues of protein in 10 different poses per run. Best binding
pose was determined by the consistent minimum binding
energy and inhibitory constant per run through lamarkian
algorithm. Ellipro server (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/ellipro/) 
was utilized for the surface epitopes prediction.

Results &amp; discussion
Polyphenols by LC-MS/MS:
The concentration of identified polyphenols, phenolic acids,
flavonoids and flavonols was quantified by LC-MS/MS by
using external calibration method Table 1 (see supplementary
material), Figure 2. Ten compounds were identified out of 11
standards run. The results showed Cinnamic acid (3.77 µg/100
g) as a predominant compound followed by identified
flavonols; Quercetin and myricetin. Quercetin is reported as an
effective bronchodilator and helps to reduce the release of
histamine and other allergic or inflammatory chemicals in the
body [26]. It has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects
which might help in the reduction of prostate inflammation
[27]. A Finnish study correlated high myricetin consumption
with lower risk of prostate cancer. Phenolic acids such as gallic
acid and salicylic acid were also identified in the
extract. While gallic acid is known to have anti-fungal
and antiviral properties and antioxidant activity. Salicylic acid
is known for its ability to ease aches and pains and lower body
temperature in case of fever [28]. The obtained Chorogenic acid
is reported for its antioxidant and anti-hypertensive potential.
Current lifestyle adjustment for management of cardiovascular
diseases and dietary consumption of Chorogenic
acids sounds promising for providing a non-pharmacological
approach for prevention of high blood pressure
and its treatment [29]. p-Coumaric acid identified in the fruit
possesses antioxidant properties and decreases the risk of
stomach cancer by reducing the formation of carcinogenic
nitrosamines [30]. Ferulic acid was not identified among run
standards.

Antimicrobial activity:
The antibacterial activities of MeOH extract of B. sapida is
summarized in Figure 1. The extract (MeOH) show appreciable
antibacterial activity against gram positive and gram negative
bacteria. The MIC of extract against all tested bacteria ranged
between 2.5–5 mg ml–1. The zone of inhibition for Shigella
flexeneri was obtained as 18.8±0.7 mm, which is higher among
all tested bacteria. In our previous study [31], GC-MS results
(MeOH extract) revealed the presence of most common fatty
acids and other phytochemicals which are essentially used to
regulate various functions like immune response, blood
pressure, lipid levels and inflammation response to injury [32].
The unsaturated fatty acids - palmitic acid, oleic acid and lauric
acid in Baccaurea sapida , exhibit antimicrobial properties 
[33–34]. 
2-Furan carboxylic acid has been reported for its use
as a preservative and also acts as a bactericide and fungicide.
LC-MS/MS screening showed the presence Sinapic and
cinnamic acid which may be contributing to these antimicrobial
properties [35].

Docking results:
Three dimensional (3D) structure of recombinant B domain of
Staphylococcal protein A (PDB ID: 1BDC) was obtained from
Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb). This protein
played influential role in S. aureus during the pathogenesis of
human infections and attachment to the cell wall envelope 
[36].
Protein A is considered to be the ligand of immunoglobulin and
it is distributed over the surface of the bacterium 
[37]. Sortase
enzyme is resolved by peptidoglycan substrate during the cell
wall anchoring that result into amide bond formation between
surface protein and bacterial cell wall envelope 
[38].
Recombinant B domain of Staphylococcal protein A have the
function to bind with Fc region of immuno-globulin G (IgG). In
the present study, identified ligands were analysed for their
toxicity on the basis of experimentally determined
carcinogenicity of the compounds and compares them based on
the 2D descriptor, stereo chemistry and pharmacophores. The
lazer toxicity analysis server revealed that these biologically
active anti-inflammatory compounds may not be carcinogenic
to the animal models such as hamster and mouse. The QSAR
study of the ligands is detailed in Table 2 (see supplementary
material).

Protein ligand interaction study has been performed through
AutoDock4 (Figure 3). Inhibitory constants and binding
energies of these ligands are summarized in Table 3 (see
supplementary material). Docking studies indicated that
quercetin and myricetin may be possible inhibitors of protein A
but comparative analysis implicates quercetin as the most
potent compound. It has minimum binding energy as well as
inhibitory constant in comparison to myricetin and other
compounds. Also the QSAR analysis of quercetin revealed that
the molecular weight and total surface polarity is considerable
enough to prevent passage of ligand through the membrane
barrier. This non-permeable ligand will only interfere with the
domain B of protein A during the chronic Staphylococcal
infection but cannot traverse the membrane to inhibit the
similar kind of human proteins. Surface epitope analysis
revealed binding of quercetin with antigenic epitope
(TADNKFNKEQ) which may hamper its interactions with IgG
(Figure 4). Further, it may inhibit the immune interaction by
blocking the large surface epitope in spite of interfering the
whole protein A. Reduced activity of this protein may lead the
pathogenic bacteria to be less virulent and viable. The quercetin
may be used to create the drug model with anti-inflammatory
effect through the inhibitory effects on domain B of protein A.
Thus, drug targeting this domain will directly interfere with the
interaction of protein A with IgG so it may be used as a lead
compound for more efficient future drug design through
inhibition of Staphylococcal protein A.

Conclusions
On the basis of present analysis, the fruit has been found to be a
rich source of bioactive compounds and offers opportunities to
develop value added products, food applications and can be
used for relieving the symptoms of inflammation as in RA.
Comparative docking analysis revealed quercetin as most
potent anti-inflammatory compound with minimum binding
energy and inhibitory constant along with no toxicity and
carcinogenicity. Quercetin can inhibit bacterial surface protein
Staphylococcal protein A by interfering with its surface
antigenic epitope. Other than gaining higher commercial value
for local underutilized fruits, the data seems beneficial to
promote this locally distributed fruit and encourages its
growth at a larger scale. Our study justifies the use of this fruit
as folk medicine for preventing inflammation and associated
disorders.
