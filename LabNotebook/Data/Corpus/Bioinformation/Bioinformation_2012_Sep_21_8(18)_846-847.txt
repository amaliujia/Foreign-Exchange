NRF2 – nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 is also known
as GA binding protein transcription factor, alpha subunit
60kDa- GABPA [,
]. A recent literature review suggests that
NRF2 has complex regulatory roles in cancer. NRF2 is a
transcription factor and is upregulated by oncogenes. NRF2 is
an antioxidant master regulator and for example, binds to ARE
–antioxidant response element. NFR2 lowers ROS (in pancreatic
and lung cancers). However, NRF2 silences miR200a (a miRNA)
(in breast cancer) that leads to additional expression of its
repressor, KEAP1. Therapies are under investigation [].

The two figures illustrate various gene interactions, up to 100
for each figure.  shows interactions for NRF2 and
GABPA that the database treats as similar.  shows
interactions and neighboring genes among NRF2-GABPA,
KEAP1, NFE2L2, ROS, miR200a, COPD, and MS.

It is left as a puzzle for the interested reader to identify the
various genes and their functionsin the figures [,
