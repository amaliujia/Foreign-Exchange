Background
Interleukin-10 (IL-10) was earlier described as a multifunctional
Type II/ T helper 2 cytokine []. Subsequently, it has been
shown to be broadly expressed cytokine produced by many
cells of innate and adaptive immune system including, activated
T cells, B cells, keratinocytes, mast cells, monocytes/
macrophages, NK cells, neutrophils, DCs, eosinophils,
mesengial cells, epithelial cells, tumor cells and other cell types
[,
,
].
This complex cytokine controls inflammatory responses
and primarily inhibit the synthesis of a number of cytokines,
including interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-
6, IL-8 and IL-12 [] and hence was initially named as Cytokine
synthesis inhibitory factor []. It is a potent inhibitor of antigen
presentation as they are responsible for inhibiting major
histocompatibility complex class II expression and also inhibit
the differentiation and maturation of DCs []. Apart from its
potent anti-inflammatory role, this interleukin also has
immunostimulatory activity toward the growth and
differentiation of activated B cells, cytokine activated T cells,
mast cells and potentiates cytokine production by natural killer
cells [,
]. IL-10 has important therapeutic applications for the
treatment of acute and chronic inflammation, autoimmunity,
cancer and infectious diseases [].

The induction of the anti-inflammatory response is mediated
through the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) and activation of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [,
]. The
transcription of this gene has been studied in various cells. IL-10
gene expression is regulated by constitutively and ubiquitously
expressed SP1 and SP3 as key transcription factors, hence the
transcription of IL-10 continues even when other cytokine genes
are inactive []. Many transcription factors regulate the
expression of IL-10 both in antigen presenting cells and in
CD4+T cells. Transcriptions of IL-10 from different species have
been reported to be differentially regulated under different
conditions and a number of signalling molecules have been
reported to regulate IL-10 regulation []. The IL-10 gene has
been extensively studied from a number of mammalian species
and is reported to have five exons and four introns and several
‘ATTTA’- mRNA instability motifs at 3׳- untranslated regions
[]. The gene encoding human IL-10 is located on chromosome
1 and a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) have been identified in the IL-10 gene promoter. The
gene encodes a 178 amino acids long protein, which is secreted
after cleavage of signal peptide comprising of 18 amino acids
[]. IL-10 is a key immunoregulatory cytokine during infection
and henceforth, it is required for optimal pathogen clearance
and ameliorates immunopathology. Therapeutic strategies can
augment IL-10 to reduce host injury during infection. In this
study, interleukin-10 gene was cloned and genomic sequence
was characterized from Labeo rohita, an economically important
major fresh water carp of Indian subcontinent. The results from
this study will help to understand the biological functions and
structure-function relation of the IL-10 of L. rohita.

Methodology
Analysis of squence conservation in IL-10 homologues from fish belonging to Cyprinidae family:
Multiple nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignment of IL-
10 from homologues of fishes belonging to Cyprinidae family
was performed. IL-10 sequences of Cyprinus carpio (Common
carp, GenBank Acc. No. JX524551.1), Danio rerio (Zebra fish,
GenBank Acc. No AY887900.1), and Hypophthalmichthys molitrix
(Silver carp, GenBank Acc. No. DQ058296.1) were taken from
nucleotide sequence database (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore) 
[]. Identity and similarity percentage among the
three species were calculated using Emboss water 
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ Tools/psa/ emboss water/) 
[].

Cloning of genomic LrIL-10:
Genomic DNA was isolated from L. rohita head kidney by the
method described by Upadhyaya et al. [] and used as a
template for amplification of the genomic IL-10 gene of L. rohita.
Primers were designed on the basis of multiple sequence
alignment using ClustalW of nucleotide sequences of three fish
species namely Cyprinus carpio (JX524551.1), Danio rerio
(AY887900.1), Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Silver carp,
DQ058296.1) The gLrIL-10 was PCR amplified using the
forward primer 5׳_“-GTTTTCAGTGGAGTCATCCTT-3” and
the reverse primer 5׳_“-TAAGTGCTTGACTCTCTTTGA-3”
using Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). The reaction
mixture consisted of 100 ng of L. rohita genomic DNA, dNTP
mix (0.2 mM each), 10 pmole of each primer, 1 × Taq buffer, 3
mM MgCl2 and 5 % DMSO and 1 U of ExTaq DNA polymerase
(Takara Bio Inc, Japan), in a final volume of 50 μl. Amplification
was carried out for 30 cycles, each including denaturation at 95
°C for 30 sec, annealing at 52°C for 30 sec and extension at 72°C
for 30 sec. Initial denaturation was done for 1 min and the final
extension at 72°C for 7 min. The amplified product was gel
purified using Qiagen gel extraction kit as per manufacturer׳s
instructions and ligated to pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega,
USA). Competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Novagen, USA)
were transformed with the ligation mix and the transformants
were selected on Luria-Bertani-agar medium (Difco, USA)
containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The positive clones were
confirmed by colony PCR using the same primers and PCR
conditions as described for gene amplification and release of the
insert upon restriction digestion with SalI (New England
Biolabs, USA). DNA sequence of the cloned insert was
determined by automated DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing
Facility, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi).

Sequence analysis of genomic LrIL-10:
The gLrIL-10 amino acid sequences were deduced using the
Expasy translate tool (http://www.expasy.org) 
[]. The
nucleotide sequences were analyzed by the BLAST program
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) 
[]. Theoretical molecular
weight and isoelectric point was analysed using Compute
pI/Mw tool at the Expasy server []. Signal peptide search was
performed with SignalP 3.0. (
www.cbs.dtu.dk /services/SignalP) 
[]. Multiple sequence alignment was created with the
ClustalO program (
http://www.ebi.ac. uk/Tools/msa/clustalo) 
[]. IL-10 protein sequences were obtained from
Genbank. Different species selected for multiple sequence
alignment with their common names and GenBank accession
numbers are given in the legend to 
(see supplementary material).

Phylogenetic relationship analysis:
The evolutionary relationship of the protein encoded by the
cloned rLrIL-10 sequence with IL-10 from other species was
inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [] after multiple
sequence alignment. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in
MEGA6 with 500 replications to obtain Bootstrap values 
[].
Thirty five IL-10 amino acid sequences (corresponding to
Interleukin-10 of different species) were selected. The
confidence probability (multiplied by 100) that the interior
branch length is greater than 0, as estimated using the bootstrap
test (500) replicates is shown next to the branches 
[]. The tree
is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those
of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree.
The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson
correction method [] and are in the units of the number of
amino acid substitutions per site. All positions containing gaps
and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 139
positions in the final dataset.

Results &amp; Discussion
Sequence analysis of IL-10 homologues of fishes belonging to Cyprinidae family:
In order to clone the L. rohtia genomic IL-10, primers were
designed on the basis of identity and similarity shared among
the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of known IL-10 from
fishes of Cyprinidae family. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence
alignment of the three selected species are shown in
 &amp; 
, (see
supplementary material) respectively. Nucleotides sequence
analysis using Emboss water tool revealed that H. molitrix and
C. carpio shared 74.4% identity while their amino acid showed
87%. identitiy and 95% similiarity. Amino acid and nucleotide
sequence of H. molitrix and Danio rerio showed 50.3% and 50.2%
similarity, respectively.

Cloning of genomic LrIL-10:
Cloning strategy for cloning the genomic IL-10 from L. rohita is
shown in . Primers designed on the basis of conserved
regions of IL-10 homologues from three fishes of Cyprinidae
family namely C. carpio, H. molitrix, and D. rerio were used to
amplify genomic IL-10 from Labeo rohita head kidney. An
amplified product of ~ 1.5 kb () was ligated to pGEMT
Easy vector. Colony PCR using primers used for PCR
amplification confirmed cloning of the PCR amplified product
in to pGEM-T Easy vector. Release of ~1.5 kb from the
recombinant plasmid upon digestion with SalI further
confirmed cloning of the amplified product (). Final
confirmation of the positive clones was made by automated
sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of genomic IL-10 (gLrIL-
10) gene has been deposited to GenBank database with
accession number HM363517.1.

Genomic structure, nucleotide (nt) sequence and organization of
the cloned gLrIL-10 are shown in . The cloned gLrIL-10
is of 1467 nucleotide length. Analysis of the DNA sequence
revealed the gLrIL-10 to be made up of five exons and four
introns with distinct well conserved intron-exon junctions
observed in IL-10 homologues from other species. Schematic
representation of the cloned rLrIL-10 is shown in Figue 2A. The
five exons (indicated as I,II, III, IV and V) are of 168 bp , 57 bp,
153 bp, 63 bp, and 96 bp, spanning nucleotide positions 1-168,
319-375, 618-770, 1200-1262 and 1372-1467, respectively 
(). The four introns numbered as 1 to 4 stretch between the
exons and are of 150 bp, 242 bp, 429 bp and 109 bp in length,
respectively (shown in lower case in ). Exon I and
intron 3 are the longest stretch while exon II and intron 4 are the
shortest. Human genomic IL-10 is also made up of five exons
and 4 introns although introns of gLrIL-10 are much smaller
than those of human IL-10. Exon I is of longest stretch in both
human and gLrIL-10, but instead of intron 3 as in gLrIL-10,
intron 4 is longest in human IL-10 gene (Accession no. U16720.1.
Amongst Cyprinidae family, IL-10 genes from C. carpio
(Accession no.JX524551.1), H.molitrix [Acc. No. DQ058296.1], C.
catla [Acc. No. 312386552] and D. rerio [Acc. No.AY887900.1]
have also been reported with 5 exons and 4 introns. Typical
intron splice motif was observed at the 5׳ (GT, shown in red
box) and 3׳ (AG, shown in blue fonts) ends of each intron. The
mature gLrIL-10 encodes for 157 amino acid residues, with a
theoretical molecular weight of 18.53 kDa and isoelectric point
of 8.5. The first 22 amino acid residues were predicted to be a
signal peptide by the SignalP program with cleavage site
present between Cys22 and Arg23.

Blast P of the gLrIL-10 amino acid sequence showed that it
shared 26-98% identity with known IL-10 sequences of other
species. The gLrIL-10 amino acid sequence showed highest
homology (98%) with C. catla IL-10, while least similarity was
observed with the IL-10 of Ochotona princeps (American pica).
Percentage indentity and similarity of pairwise LrIL-10
sequence alignment of LrIL-10 with human is 27.2 % and 54.95
%, respectively. BlastP of the amino acid sequence of LrIL-10
showed that among the fish species, percentage identities of the
LrIL-10 with the IL-10 of C. catla, C. carpio, H. molitrix, D. rerio, C.
auratus,C. idella, T. rubripes, and D. labrax, were 98%, 93%, 89%,
80%, 87%, 88%, 47%, 46%, respectively. Despite the low amino
acid identity between IL-10 from human and other mammalian
species, there is a high degree conservation of residues which
may play important role for stabilization of the structural core
of IL-10. Multiple sequence alignment of the gLrIL-10 with the
IL-10 of other species, shown in 
revealed that although there are significant differences among
the IL-10 from different species, the signature sequences of the
IL-10 super family remain conserved. Two typical IL-10
signature sequence motifs were identified in gLrIL-10, L43 to L73
and K133 to E146 (LLNENVQQNI-NSPYGCHVMNEILRFYLDTIL
and KAMGELDMLFKYIE). The putative mature peptides of
LrIL-10 contain four conserved cysteine residues (Cys31, Cys80,
Cys128 and Cys134), which are known to play critical role in
tertiary structure []. The mature peptide also contains two
extra cysteine residues (Cys27 and Cys32), which are
significantly conserved only in Cyprinidae family, however their
role in IL-10 structure and function is not yet investigated.

Phylogenetic analysis:
The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 5.12655948
was obtained (). The phylogenetic tree was generated
by multiple sequence alignment of IL-10 amino acid sequences
from 35 species (). The tree topology shows that LrIL-10
is very closely related to fishes of Cyprinidae family i.e. C. catla
(catla), C. carpio (common carp), H. molitrix (silver carp) and C.
idella (grass carp). As evident from the tree, other vertebrates
such as human (H. sapiens), cattle (B. Taurus), elephant (E.
maximus), deer (C. elaphus), rhesus monkey (M. mulatta) and
sheep (O. aries,) and virus are distantly related to LrIL-10.

Conclusion
The cloning, sequencing and characterization of the genomic IL-
10 gene from the fish L. rohita is of interest. Our analysis on its
gene structure, sequence conservation and phologeny show that
gLrIL-10 is an IL-10 homologue. Analysis also shows that the
gene contains two typical IL-10 signature sequence motifs. The
gene is phylogenetically closer to IL-10 of Cyprinidae family
and very distantly related to the IL-10 of human, elephant, deer
and cattle. The genomic structure of IL-10 gene elucidated from
Labeo rohita will help in understanding its function and role.
