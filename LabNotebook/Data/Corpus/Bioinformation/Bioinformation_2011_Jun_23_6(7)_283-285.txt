Background and Description
Tuberculosis (TB), an infectious disease affects millions of humans worldwide 
and is caused by the  Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. In 2009, WHO 
estimated that there were about 9.4 million new cases, with 1.3 million deaths 
globally due to tuberculosis  []. This high incidence of TB worldwide 
necessitates research on developing precise diagnostic methods for specific 
treatment and management. Currently, the disease is diagnosed by sputum 
smear examination, a rapid and cheap method but lacks specificity. Traditional 
microbial culture utilizes solid (Lowenstein-Jensen) or liquid media which 
provides a definitive diagnosis of an active infection but is time consuming (6-
8 weeks). With the advent of automated or semi-automated liquid culture 
system the time to detect the growth of mycobacterial species has been 
significantly shortened (roughly 14 days)  []. However, the systems are 
expensive and not available even in many tertiary care centres in developing 
countries. In recent years, a number of molecular diagnostic methods for 
tuberculosis have been developed based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
amplification targeting certain sequences of IS6110,  hsp65, 16srRNA, 85B 
antigen, 38kDa antigen. The IS6110 belongs to a family of insertion sequences 
(IS) of the IS3 category and its amplification is most commonly used in the 
detection of  M. tuberculosis because it is highly conserved. In addition to 
diagnosis, IS6110 insertion sequence has also been utilized for molecular 
epidemiological analysis of clinical isolates. However, the sensitivity and 
specificity of IS6110 sequence in the diagnosis of tuberculosis remains 
uncertain and needs to be appraised by in-silico analysis. In recent years, 
IS6110 based diagnosis has been shown to be hampered by the presence of low 
copy number or absence of this IS6110 repetitive sequence.

A few clinical investigations reported the presence of low copy number of 
IS6110 in M. tuberculosis strains from regions such as Tunisia, where, 75% of 
the strains showed 6-10 copies  []. In Denmark 50% of the strains analyzed 
showed 11-15 copies  [] and in different geographical regions of India 11 to 
20% of the strains showed nil or 1-2 copies of IS6110  []. A small number 
(&lt;1%) of IS6110 deficient strains have been reported in San Francisco 
[], and 
2% in Vietnam  []. 
In the present study, our primary aim was to detect the 
IS6110 sequence differences within the M. tuberculosis complex by means of 
construction of phylogenetic trees based on available IS6110 sequence at 
GenBank database and the secondary aim was to analyze the discriminatory 
potential of a list of primer pairs reported in literature which were used in the 
PCR techniques to diagnose tuberculosis.

Retrieval of IS6110 sequences
The IS6110 sequences were retrieved from the GenBank repository for the M. 
tuberculosis complex, which includes  M.tuberculosis H37Rv (Accession No: 
NC_000662.2),  M.tuberculosis H37Ra (Accession No: NC_009525),  M. 
tuberculosis CDC1551 (Accession No: NC_002755),  M.bovis strain Pasteur 
1173P2 (Accession No: NC_008769),  M. bovis AF2122/97 (Accession No: 
NC_002495.3),  M. avium  ssp. paratuberculosis  K-10, M. fortuitum, M. 
tuberculosis clone TB3A, M. tuberculosis clone TB4C, M. tuberculosis  clone 
TB2A, M. tuberculosis  SAW1690, M. tuberculosis H2255, M. tuberculosis
D7030, M. tuberculosis B9, M. tuberculosis  isolate patient 18 and M. 
tuberculosis  Norway strain. These 35 strains were subjected to in-silico 
analysis. 

Sequence alignment and phylogeny construction
The ClustalW program of the MEGA 5.03  [] was used to align the IS6110 
nucleotide sequences. Each alignment was visually examined to detect short 
misalignments and poorly aligned regions. From these aligned IS6110 
nucleotide sequences, phylogenetic tree was constructed using Maximum 
Likelihood method using Tamura-Nei model. The discriminatory potential of a 
few primer sets which have been used successfully to amplify different regions 
of IS6110 sequences in PCR assays for the detection of  M. tuberculosis in 
various clinical investigations was also analyzed.

Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis of the IS6110 sequence of M. tuberculosis H37Ra 
strain revealed the existence of sequence divergence among the individual 
copies of IS6110 in a given strain  (Figure 1) and showed four different 
clusters. A similar kind of situation was also found for M. tuberculosis H37Rv. 
It showed that two different main clusters and a few copies of IS6110 of 
H37Rv formed individual clusters (data not shown). Phylogenetic analysis of 
IS6110 sequences for M. tuberculosis CDC1551 revealed sequence divergence 
by forming two different clusters (data not shown). In our analysis,  M. 
tuberculosis clone TB3A,  M. tuberculosis TB4C,  M. tuberculosis clone TB2 
contributes to cluster I, whereas, M. tuberculosis SAW1690 formed sub-cluster 
of cluster I. M. tuberculosis D7030, M. avium 
ssp. paratuberculosis K-10, M. 
tuberculosis B9, M. tuberculosis isolate patient 18 and M.tuberculosis Norway 
strains formed independent clusters (data not shown). The IS6110 sequences of 
both the M. bovis AF2122/97 and M. bovis strain Pasteur were also included 
for phylogenetic analysis. Of them, M. bovis AF2122/97 seg7/14 copy 1 and M. 
bovis Pasteur copy 1 contributes to cluster I. M. bovis AF2122/97 seg9/14 and 
M. bovis Pasteur copy 4 formed cluster 2, whereas, the other 7 copies of 
IS6110 formed independent clusters (data not shown). The above phylogenetic 
results of the IS6110 sequences revealed the divergence in IS6110 sequences 
within the strains of M. tuberculosis and other species. However, the IS6110 
sequence is still a favorite target sequence in the diagnosis and epidemiological 
investigations of M. tuberculosis to properly categorize mycobacteria and for 
public health officials to understand the disease epidemiology.

Detection of IS6110 sequence by RFLP is the most widely used genotyping 
method besides others (Spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR, 16SrRNA), for 
epidemiologic studies. At the same time, detection of IS6110 sequence was the 
commonest approach unlike  hsp65 and  mtp40 target sequences used for 
diagnosis of tuberculosis. Reports suggested that, the sensitivity and specificity 
of the IS6110 for M. tuberculosis varies between laboratories 
[]. Further, false 
positive results are being reported frequently. In this context, we have collected 
a list of primers which were successfully used in the conventional PCR for the 
diagnosis of  M. tuberculosis  from the 13 articles  
[–]. Of the 13 
investigations, 7 investigations used primers which amplified nucleotides from 
nucleotide position 762 to 883, a 123-bp final product has been produced as a 
result of PCR and the remaining 6 investigations used different regions of 
IS6110  (). Different regions of IS6110 sequence are being used as 
target for PCR amplification. Much of these do not describe the sensitivity and 
specificity of the assay. The reported data shows varied sensitivity and 
specificity for different regions of IS110 sequence. This further baffles the 
laboratorian in selecting an optimum primer set. A majority of the assays target 
nt 762-883 region for PCR amplification. A primer set used for PCR 
identification from buffy coat and sputum as well has been reported and found 
to be having 100% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity in nested format compared 
to blood culture (BacT/ALERT 3D, Biomeriux)  []. These primers were 
found to be more efficient than other primers used to identify IS6110 lacking 
M. tuberculosis strains []. 
Thus, information on each primer sets along with 
its clinical- and assay- sensitivity and specificity, and its detection limit would 
be useful to identify an optimal primer set to facilitate rapid diagnosis.

A number of clinical investigations suggested that the reason behind the false 
positivity is due to carryover contamination of M. tuberculosis DNA which is 
probably not the story. Another reason was suggested by Sandhu et al. 
[] i.e., 
IS6110 likely to have originated from (or been passed on to) other organisms 
and certain regions of DNA that may have remained conserved among these 
organisms during evolution. This raised the possibility that some laboratories 
may have amplified stretches of DNA related to IS6110 from organisms that 
were not M. tuberculosis. This would explain some of the false positive tests 
reported in the literature. In a search of GenBank with 181-bp sequence, 63.3% 
homology in a 177-bp overlap was found with the insertion sequence IS629 of 
Shigella sonnei and 63.8% homology in a 177-bp overlap was found with the 
insertion sequence IS3411 for  Escherichia coli. In addition, with the IS6110 
specific primers this central region was amplified and Southern hybridized with 
IS6110 derived probe from the majority of non-M.tuberculosis species, thereby 
we confirmed that this central region is homologous to mycobacteria other than 
tuberculosis. Together, these data suggests to us that care must be taken while 
designing specific primers for IS6110 sequence of  M. tuberculosis. The 
presence of multiple copies of IS6110 in the majority of M. tuberculosis strains 
enhances the sensitivity of PCR tests by providing a source of “preamplified” 
sequence and in addition, deletion or mutation of one of the sequences should 
still allow for others to be intact for amplification. It is well documented that, 
M. tuberculosis isolates containing five or fewer IS6110 copies cannot be 
reliably differentiated by the RFLP method []. In conclusion, we suggest that 
great care must be given in designing primer pairs for IS6110 to prevent false 
positive or false negative results. In such cases where IS6110 RFLP typing is
not possible due to low or zero copy of the element, one should consider an 
alternate genotyping method for accurate epidemiologic or diagnostic purposes. 
For diagnostic PCRs, multiplexing by targeting two regions like IS6110 and 
hsp65 could be a good strategy.
