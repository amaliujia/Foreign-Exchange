Background
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic diseases characterized by
hyperglycemia. Ruellia tuberosa L., is widely disseminated in
South East Asian including in Indonesia, and is used as an anti-
diabetic agent traditionally.

R. tuberosa possesses significant blood glucose lowering effect in aloxan 
induced diabetic rat and rabbit [,
]. The active compound from R. Tuberosa 
that has hypoglycaemic effect has not been studied yet. It was reported five 
flavanoids: cirsimaritin, cirsimarin, cirsiliol 4-glucoside, sorbifolin, and 
pedalitin along with betulin, vanillic acid, and indole-3-carboxaldehyde were 
isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction of methanolic extracts of R. tuberosa 
[]. Apigenin, luteolin, 
3,5-diglucoside, apigenin-7-O-glucoronide, apigenin glucoside, apigenin rutinoside, 
luteolin glucoside, flavone glycoside were also reported in R. tuberosa 
[,
]. 

Inhibitor of carbohydrate digesting enzyme as alpha amylase 
is now actively searched for the medicine against diabetes, since 
it could control postprandial increase of blood glucose 
[]. 
αlpha- amylase, multidomain protein, has a catalitic (β/α)8-barrel 
with catalitic triads of Asp197, Glu233, and Asp300. The interactions 
between ligand and catalytic domain can inhibit the enzyme activities.

This research points out the modeling on an interaction between 
Alpha-amylase and compounds of R. tuberosa that has 
an anti-diabetic activity. The molecular modeling will show an
energy binding afinity (Ea), and an inhibition constant (Ki) of
the compound.

Alpha amylase inhibitor becomes a part of drug used for
diabetes. Although the final target of inhibitor is human
pancreatic alpha amylase, it is still common use in vitro or in
vivo studies on rat. It would be interesting to see the interaction
between inhibitor of rat pancreatic alpha amylase (RPA) and
human pancreatic alpha amylase (HPA) using a molecular
docking.

Methodology
Sequences alignments:
Sequences of pancreatic alpha amyle Rattus novergicus (Gen
Bank ID AAA40725.2/GI: 11528629) and human pancreatic
alpha amylase structure (PDB ID: 3OLD) [] were downloaded
from NCBI (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ structure). blastp
from NCBI tools online were used to perform alignments alpha
amylase from human and rattus (http://blast.ncbi. nlm.nih. .).
This tool reports residu that are identical (percentage of
identity), and conserve (percentage of similarity/positive).

Model generation:
The Swiss model program was used in order to make a RPA
model. SWISS-MODEL workspace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/) 
is a web-based integrated service dedicated to protein
structure homology modeling []. To make a three dimensional
protein model, the program uses the protein sequence (model),
and a three dimensional structure (template) that has a high
enough similarity to the sequence. In this case, porcine
pancreatic alpha amylase (PDB ID: 1BVN) with 1.97 Å was used
as a template.

Ligand preparation:
Three dimensional ligand structure was downloaded from
PubChem Compound (
http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The
ID of Betulin [CID 72326], Vanilic acid [CID 8468], Indole-3-
carboxaldehyde [CID 10256], Cirsimarin [CID 188323],
Sorbifolin [CID 3084390], Pedalitin [CID 31161], Apigenin [CID
5280443], Luteolin [CID 5280445], Flavone [CID 10680], and
Cirsiliol 4׳-glucoside were created with the HyperChem version
7. Their energy forms were minimized, geometrical structure
were optimized semi empirically AM1 with conjugate direction
algoritm using the HyperChem and were converted to PDB
format by the Open Babel 2.3.1. All ligands were prepared to
pdbqt format using the AutoDock Tools 1.5.6.

Docking ligand-receptor:
All receptors (alpha amylase model and 3OLD.pdb) were
prepared with the AudoDock Tools 1.5.6 for docking. Docking
(rigid docking with genetic algorithm parameter) was
performed with the autodock version 4.2.5.1 []. Additional
molecules to alpha amylase, except cofactor (Ca2+, Cl-) and
solvent were deleted prior to the docking using the Accelrys
Discovery Studio version 3.5. The bonds in the ligands were set
to be rotatable to maximize the flexibility of the ligand. The
Autodock Tools is the graphical interface to assign gasteiger
charge to reseptor and ligand molecule. The docking box was
positioned at x = 8.458, y = -5.795, z = 15.737 with a size of
62×76×66 for 3OLD.pdbqt and x = 37.309, y = 31.28, z = 44.36
with a size of 60×72×74 for RPA model. To validate the docking
method that was used, we calculate RMSD between actual pose
of the co-crystallized ligand and the redocking co-crystallized
ligand (pseudo-pentasaccharide of trestatin family) into their
respective binding sites in HPA (ib2y.pdb).

Further interaction analysis was done using the autodock tools
and was visualized using the Accelrys Discovery Studio
version 3.5. The predicted binding energy (kcal/mol), which
indicates how strongly a ligand binds to the receptor, was
calculated based on the scoring function used in the AutoDock.
A more negative binding affinity indicates stronger binding.

Discussion
Supplementary  shows the result of multiple
alignment between RPA and HPA sequences. It reveals that rat
and human have a high identity (84%) and a similarity (92%). It
means that the homology between the two species is very high.
However, the rat sequences are shorter than the human
sequences. There is a gap in the rat sequence at the position of
amino acids 142-144 in HPA.

Since there is no crystal structure of rat enzymes, computer
generated model was used in this study. Quality assesment of
generated model indicated to be reliable. Identity more than
30% between template and target is sufficient to obtain a
reliable model []. Rat pancreatic alpha amylase model has a
high sequence identity 84,677%. Futhermore the good model
show Z-score Q MEAN -0.723 and QMEAN 0.715 with a
residual error &lt; 1 Ǻ. The resulting QMEAN z-score provides an
estimate of the ‘degree of nativeness‘ of the structural features
observed in a model and indicates whether the model is of
comparable quality to experimental structures []. QMEAN is
a scoring fuction consisting of a linear combination of structural
descriptor: two distance-dependent interaction potentials of
mean force based on C-β atoms and on all atom types are used
to assess long-range interactions both are secondary structure
dependent; a torsion angle potential; finally, the agreement of
predicted and calculated secondary structure and solvent
accessibility is included in the form of two agreement terms
[]. QMEAN and agreement terms range from 0 to 1 with
higher values for more reliable candidates. Ramachandran plot
of RPA model indicates that 96.5% of its residues are situated in
the favoured and 3.15% in allowed region. According to this
quality assessment results, we believe that this model could be
considered to have enough accuracy and biological posibility
for further ligand binding studies.

An RMSD of 0.0011 Å was obtained between the best pose
obtained by redocking and the actual binding mode of ligand to
ib2y.pdb. Futhermore, an RMSD of 0.0185 Å was obtained by
redocking betulin to ib2y.pdb and the actual binding mode of
ligand to ib2y.pdb. This is satisfactory with regard of less than 2
Å threshold was usually used to assess successful docking 
[].
Binding energy and Ki of ligand to HPA and RPA model was
shown in table 1 of the suplementary material. Binding energy
is vary between -1.92 to -6.66 kcal/mol in RPA and -3.06 to -
8.42kcal/mol in HPA. In general betulin is calculated to be the
strongest binding to alpha amylase both in RPA (E binding -6.66
kcal/mol, Ki 13.12 μM) and HPA (E binding -8.42 kcal/mol, Ki
0.67μM). These docking results verify that betulin is more
efficient ligand and more affinity of all towards alpha amylase
in RPA model and HPA. Interestingly, betulin binds stronger in
HPA than RPA.

Betulin-alpha amylase complex was shown bellow 
(). Further analysis shows that betulin 
has vanderwaals interaction with ASN 115, ASN 152, ARG 170, 
ASP 179, HIS 213 () and hydrogen bond 2.22Å and 
2.32 Å with ASP368 in RPA. This interaction is different 
between betulin and HPA (vanderwaals interaction with ASN 100, 
ASN137, ARG 158, ASP167, ASP 197, HIS201, and hydrogen bond 2.44Å 
with ASP 300) (). Betulin has an interaction with the 
catalytic site both in HPA and RPA. It means that betulin could be 
a potential inhibitor of alpha amylase. The ligand position diferences 
in alpha amylase are due to gab presence between RPA and HPA sequence. 

In order to get an approximation of the possible effectiveness 
of betulin as potential inhibitor to alpha amylase, docking score was 
obtained for the betulinic acid. Betulin is a derivate of betulinic 
acid. From the experimental study, betulinic acid, compound of aqueous 
extract S cumini׳s show 98% inhibitory activity to porcine pancreatic 
alpha amylase with non-competitive manner []. 
Molecular docking of Betulin has a smaller Ebinding and Ki value 
((Ebinding -6.66 kcal/mol, Ki 13.12 µM to RPA and (Ebinding -8.42 
kcal/mol, Ki 0.67µM to HPA) than betulinic acid (Ebinding -6.44 kcal/mol, 
Ki 18.97 µM to RPA and Ebinding -7.08 kcal/mol, Ki 6.48 µM to HPA). 
Futhermore, betulinic acid and betulin shows the same interaction to amino 
acid residue of alpha amylase  (see supplementary material). It 
suggests that betulin could be potential inhibitor with non-competitive 
pattern like betulinic acid. In comparison, acarbose had Ki around 2.6 µM 
[], which 
suggesting that betulin could be potentially better than acarbose, but 
this assumption still remains to be verified.

Conclusion
Overall, betulin is the most potential α-amylase inhibitor 
compound in Ruellia tuberosa. It suggests the inhibition of 
pancreatic alpha amylase both in rat and human. The
shortening of α-amylase residue in rat enzyme should be
highlighted, as it may produce effect in the case of ki, Ebinding,
and the interaction between ligand and enzyme. The
approximity based on the ki suggesting that betulin is more
potential as a inhibitor rather than acarbose with noncompetitive
pattern inhibition, but this assumption must be
verified in vitro.
