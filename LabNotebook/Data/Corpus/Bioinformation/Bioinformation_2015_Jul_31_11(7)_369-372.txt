about 54,310 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in the seven species in a high-throughput manner. The database
consists of three major functional categories: SNP marker search, detailed information viewer and download of SNP sequence. The
SNP annotation table provides detailed information such as ownership information, basic information, bio-entry information,
reference, comments, features, and sequence data.

Background
A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a DNA sequence
variation that occurs at the level of one base-pair among
individuals or between paired chromosomes [1]. It is highly
abundant in the genomes and has been frequently utilized as a
molecular marker in the diverse field. Particularly, its
association with a specific trait such as development, resistance
to abiotic or biotic stresses or disease symptoms has served as
one of the most useful tools in the area of, for example, crop
breeding or disease diagnosis etc. Recently, the progress in
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has
tremendously accumulated sequence information from which
great amounts of SNPs have been mined. Furthermore, NGS,
SNP chip and high-resolution melting analysis can easily
detect SNPs with the relatively lower cost and labor in both
high- and low-throughput mode, which facilitates the usage of
SNPs in the molecular, genetic and genomic study such as
quantitative trait loci mapping, genotyping-by-sequencing and
genome-wide association studies etc. With the explosion of
SNP-related information, multiple databases for SNP markers
have been constructed. The dbSNP is a public large-scale
database of simple genetic variations in any species and is
operated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information
[2]. JSNP is a repository specializing in SNPs from the Japanese
population and supports user interface facilitating database
accessibility via keywords search such as polymorphisms,
genes and drug-metabolizing enzymes, etc [3]. For the
important crops such as rice, barley, wheat and Brassica, the
AutoSNPdb provides both information on annotated SNPs
using graphical interface and integrated pipeline to discover
SNPs [4]. Especially for rice, the SNP-Seek system is a database
for SNPs as well as genotype, phenotype and variety
information about 3,000 varieties [5], while the HapRice is a
repository for haplotype SNPs and provides web-based tools
for finding polymorphic SNPs and designing primers to
develop cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence markers at
any SNP [6]. Considering the significance of SNP database and
its application, the National Agricultural Biotechnology
Information Center (NABIC) previously provided a function
for SNP discovery across the entire rice genome and SNP
information such as marker name, EST number, gene
definition and general marker information [7]. Recently, it has 
expanded its archives to the other species, which will be
discussed below.

Methodology
Data collection and development:
The information on SNPs was collectively acquired from the
research projects supported by Next-Generation BioGreen 21
Program (http://www.tagc.or.kr/) of Rural Development
Administration. Initially, SNPs were discovered by pair-wisely
aligning expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to genomic sequences
and identifying polymorphic sequences between the two. In
addition, they were collected from high density microarray
platforms and next generation whole-genome sequencing data.
A total of 54,310 potential SNPs were detected from nonredundant
genes for cattle (Bos taurus, 12,000 records), swine
(Sus scrofa, 609 records), oriental melon (Cucumis melo, 41,651
records), grape (Vitis flexuosa, 14 records), rootstock for grape
(Vitis vinifera, 10 records), mung bean (Vigna radiate, 24
records) and small sea snails (Hemifusus tuba, 2 records). Using
the collected SNP markers, a database was constructed using
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Java and Hypertext
Preprocessor (PHP). Its platform for the web server was
developed using MySQL for PHP environment and database
handling.

Implementation and features:
The NABIC SNP database features three major functions:
marker search, detailed information viewer, and download of
SNP sequence (Figure 1). Through marker search, users can
easily access specific SNPs information among 54,310 SNP
markers in seven species. Specifically, this database supports
keyword search consisting of seven identification categories
(i.e., ID, source, species, type, content, pub date, and
ownership). For example, if ‘Cucumis melo’ is entered as a
query in the species of marker search, a summarized table is
generated, as shown in Figure 1. Clicking on ID shows the
detailed information of SNPs, such as ownership information,
basic information, bio-entry information, reference, comments,
features and sequence data (Figure 2).

Utility, caveats and future developments:
The NABIC SNP database provides detailed information on
SNPs in seven species and has three major utility features
(detailed information viewer, SNP search and download
function). Using specific SNP markers, any new structures of
the chromosomes and positional function of gene are easily 
tracked. The NABIC SNP database was planned to integrate
the detailed information on SNPs and provide them through a
user-friendly platform with marker search options online. In
the future, NABIC will be further improved by combining
more information including SNPs and other genetic markers
into its database storage and expanding or refining keyword
options for marker search.

This study was conducted with support from the Research
Program for Agricultural Science &amp; Technology Developmen t
(Project No. PJ010112) of the National Academy of Agricultural
Science, Rural Development Administration, Republic of
Korea.
