Background
The proteome of an organism is broadly defined as the sum total of
all proteins expressed by its genome []. The sequencing and
annotation of large numbers of genomes have generated a
considerable amount of raw material for the investigation of
proteins and their component domains. Given the breadth of data
available, a powerful tool to identify the underlying principles that
govern the length or domain content of proteins is the comparative
analysis across species. This type of analysis has been used to
identify the functional and evolutionary constraints that control the
domain content and length of proteins. Perhaps the most interesting
revelation from the comparative analysis of proteins is the
combinatorial nature of all proteomes. The majority of proteins
across all kingdoms are built from a limited inventory of domains
that are combined in different ways 
[,]. The duplication, deletion,
fission, and fusion of single domains and groups of domains have
been described in all kingdoms and vary by gene family 
[,,].
The exact mechanism behind the duplications and exchange remain
elusive; however, it has been hypothesized that functional
constraints may favor the duplication of certain domains or groups
of domains [,]. While fusion of domains and whole proteins are
by far the most commonly occurring evolutionary events, many of
the metazoan­specific protein families have highly variable numbers
of repeated domains that are related to their function []. For
proteins that contain repeating domains, indels (insertion and/or
deletion events) are the most common followed by the repetition of
multiple domains [,]. Since the addition, deletion, or fusion of
two domains can have profound impact on the function of a protein,
the evolutionary history of any given species is reflected in the
unique combination of domains that make up its proteome.

Another important area of investigation has been the identification
of factors that influence protein length. Significant protein length
differences, even among clusters of orthologous groups (COGs),
have between well described for eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea
[,]. The lengths of proteins, even within a given species, can
vary by several orders of magnitude from less than 100 amino acids
to greater than 30,000 amino acids. In metazoans, many of the
larger multi-domain proteins are formed as the result of the
combinatorial rearrangement of domains present in all kingdoms [,,&gt;]. Regardless of the etiology of the variation, the fusion and
expansion of domains contributes significantly to the length of
proteins in all species. It is reasonable to assume that larger proteins
involved in complex biological processes are likely to have more
domains; however, the predictors of protein length at the domain
level are not well understood. For example, given proteins with the
same number of domains, how does the domain content (repetitive ­ vs­ non-repetitive) of the protein influence protein length ?Similarly, what are the biological processes that select for proteins
with increased numbers of domains? To address these outstanding
questions, we used data from 49 metazoan species in conjunction
with the structured Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary to determine
the relationship between protein length, domain content, and
function.

Length distribution and domain distribution of proteins
To determine the length and domain distribution of proteins in
metazoans and validate our approach, we obtained information for
843,871 domain­annotated proteins from 49 animal species in
Ensembl (v.56) or EnsemblMetazoa (v.3) []. The length
distribution for proteins over intervals of 100 amino acid was
obtained by calculating the number of proteins in each interval
relative to the total number of proteins for each species (). The distribution of metazoan proteins grouped by phylum and
class showed remarkable similarity over all intervals tested. These
data are similar to previously published results using other methods
and suggest that our data set provides a precise representation of the
metazoan protein length distribution [,,&gt;]. Proteins were
scored for the presence of Interpro (IPR) annotated domains in order
to determine the distribution of multi­domain proteins in metazoans
() []. When proteins with multiple isoforms were
encountered, the variant with the most domains was selected in all
cases. Much like the length distributions, the domain distributions
in all metazoans tested were remarkably similar ().

Domain content influences protein length
Large proteins involved in multiple cellular processes are more
likely to contain multiple domains. To identify the relationship
between length and domain content, we compared protein length to
domain count across all proteins (). Interestingly, the
relationship between these two properties is not a simple linear
polynomial; rather, the best-fit line is a weak power function (y =
393.23e0.0672x), suggesting that length constraints become
increasingly relaxed as proteins begin to acquire more domains. To
further investigate this relationship, we assessed length and domain
information based on the presence or absence of repeat domains
(). For this analysis, a repeat domain was defined as any
domain that occurred two or more times on a protein. Repeatcontaining
proteins (RCP) and non-repeat-containing proteins (NRCP) were analyzed separately to 
identify any differences in protein length based on repetitive character. 
When proteins with less than five domains were considered, NRCPs were 
found to be significantly longer than RCPs. In contrast, when proteins with
more than eight domains were considered, NRCPs were found to be
significantly shorter than RCPs.

Identification of functions that favor multi-domain proteins
We took advantage of the structured Gene Ontology (GO) []
vocabulary to identify biological processes, cellular components, or
molecular functions that favor multi­domain proteins. GO IDs
associated with each protein were obtained from Ensembl (v.56)
and EnsemblMetazoa (v.3) BioMarts. A domain distribution was
generated for each GO ID and graphed as a fraction of the subset of
the proteins annotated with that ID (). This was done
iteratively for all GO IDs with more than five proteins. Examples
of GO IDs found to have a substantially higher than average
domain­per­protein counts are shown in .

Discussion
Length constraints are relaxed as domain count increases
With the availability of multiple animal proteomes in public
databases it is clear that protein length can vary over several orders
of magnitude within a given proteome, yet the distribution of
protein lengths across metazons are very similar. Interestingly, our
results indicate that protein length constraints are not fixed as a
linear function of domain count; rather, overall protein length
constrains are relaxed with increasing domain count. When proteins
become larger than approximately 500 amino acids (or 5 domains)each additional domain will, on average, increase the length of the
protein by more than the previous domain. Several mechanisms
(recombination, exon shuffling) for the expansion of proteins size
have been previously suggested [], and it is possible that some of
these same mechanisms could be involved in the relaxation of
length constraints. For example, the relaxed constraints could
reflect the increased contribution of recombination when the
underlying genomic sequence of a protein reaches some critical size
[]. Another possibility is that relaxed constraints may reflect a
selection for a specific number of domains in certain protein
families []. Regardless, at some point, the length of a protein is
likely to be limited by the evolutionary constraints that act to
minimize sequences with no required functional roles because
energetic of the costs associated with processing multi­domain
proteins [,].

The presence of repeat domains influences protein length
To determine the relationship between domain content and protein
length, we separated proteins based on the presence or absence of
repeated domains. Curiously, we found that repeat­containing
proteins (RCP) were significantly shorter than non­repeatcontaining
proteins (NRCP) when less than five domains were
present; however, RCP were significantly longer when eight or
more domains were present. It is unlikely that this difference in
growth rate is result of length differences between the two types of
domains themselves, since the average lengths (NRCP = 133.7+/­
98.9, RCP = 127.1+/­93.0 ) and medians (NRCP = 113, RCP = 103)
of repeat domains and unique domains were not significantly
different in the species studied. Interestingly, while the average size
of RCP increased steadily with domain count, the average size of
NRCP remained between 400 and 600 residues regardless of the
number of domains. Possible explanations could be that genes that
contain repeat domains tend to have extra sequences that increase
their length­to­domain ratio [] or that proteins that contain domains
that repeat may be easier to fold, thus mitigating the costs associated
with processing and allowing them to grow larger.

Proteins related by biological function have similar domain counts
It is clear that domain combinations vary dramatically across
kingdoms and may have played a role in the evolution of metazoanspecific
functions []. In general, it is thought that evolution selects
for the proteins with the minimal number of amino acids needed to
perform their function because they are more efficient to produce
[]. From this we would expect that proteins with fewer domains
would be biosynthetically favored, and indeed, our analysis of the
metazoan domain distribution corroborates that proteins are more
likely to have fewer domains than many (). However, as
demonstrated in , certain proteins involved in a specific
biological process (A), cellular component (B), or molecular
function (C) often strongly favor the presence of many domains
because it is beneficial or essential to their function. As expected,
many of the GO IDs associated with elevated domain-per-protein
counts were composed of closely related proteins. For example,
GO:0002316 () is associated only with the Plcg2 gene
family. This is not always the case, however, as other GO IDs were
associated with several unrelated families, all favoring multidomain
proteins. GO:0000235 () contains 27 gene
products from a variety of families and species, all of which are
involved in astral microtubules and favor the incorporation of
approximately 8 domains.

Limitations
The analysis presented in this work has several limitations. For
example, we restricted our dataset to domain­annotated metazoan
proteins available from Ensembl (v.56) and EnsemblMetazoa (v.3).
While this data set is extensive, it could be further refined by the
addition of information from other databases or the inclusion of
more species. In addition, an important future direction could be
the inclusion of positional information for each domain to assess the
contribution of N- and C- terminal changes and internal duplications
[].

Conclusion
The need for large, multi-domain proteins in complex cellular
processes is likely to be balanced by the evolutionary constraints
that govern protein length. In species that have evolved complex
biological processes, proteins tend to be longer than in simpler
organisms; this can clearly be seen when comparing eukaryotic and
prokaryotic proteins []. In order to elucidate the determinants of
protein length in metazoans, we analyzed proteome data from 49
species to identify common patterns. Our results indicate that the
presence of repeating domains is associated with a relaxation of the
constraints that govern protein length; however, for proteins with
unique domains, length constraints were generally maintained. In
addition, we identified biological processes, molecular functions,
and cellular components that favor proteins with increased numbers
of domains. This study lays important groundwork for future
research into the global constraints on protein evolution and the
relationship between length, function, and domain content.
