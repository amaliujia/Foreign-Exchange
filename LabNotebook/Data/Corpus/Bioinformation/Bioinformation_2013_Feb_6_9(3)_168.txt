An error was detected in the article, NRF2 molecule of the
month []. This error is subsequent to the confusion in a few
databases that do not distinguish between capital and lower
case letters. For the interested reader, it is important to note that
there are two different genes termed NRF2 and Nrf2. One NRF2
gene is also known as NFE2L2 that is not a GA binding protein.
The other Nrf2 gene is nuclear respiratory factor 2 that is related
to GABPA, a different protein. There was a distinction between
the two genes that should have been indicated in the
publication []. The first reference in the publication 
[] was
reexamined http://www.sabiosciences.com/pathwaymagazine

This reference was searched for; however, it is no longer
accessible as of 11-15-2012. Moreover, not all databases clearly
distinguish between the two NRF2 and Nrf2 labels. There is
also a typographical error in the 7th line of the article text where
NFR2 should be stated as NRF2 []. In addition, similar
information should be pointed out in regards to the two figures
[].

Searches at the SABiosciences,STRING (Search Tool for the
Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins),HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and GeneCards web
sitesdid not distinguish between NRF2 and Nrf2 as of 11-18-
2012 [,

]. Searches for both NRF2 and Nrf2 at the
SABiosciences web site revealed the following information 
[].
NFE2L2 (Human) Gene Name: NRF2
Refseq IDs: NM_006164, NM_001145412, NM_001145413
Description: Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2

And GABPA (Human) Gene Name: E4TF1-60, E4TF1A,
NFT2, NRF2, NRF2A Refseq IDs: NM_002040, NM_001197297.
Description: GA binding protein transcription factor, alpha
subunit 60kDa

Additionally, some literature correctly portrays the information
on Nrf2 in the publications []. For example, in this paper, the
protein Nrf2 is defined as Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-
like 2 (Nrf2) which is a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-regulated
transcription factor involved in the inductionof Phase II
detoxifying proteins.

There are no financial conflicts. Many thanks go to Professor
S.R. Konjeti (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) for
providing information and pointing out the needed corrections
and for pointing out problems associated with the monthly
molecule review.
