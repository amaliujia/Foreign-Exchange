Background
Restricted access to vital resources, scientific information and
infrastructures, in the field of computational biology and
bioinformatics, is one of the challenges facing aspiring scholars
in some developing countries [–]. In the African continent,
students and researchers who live in some rural communities
are often confronted with inaccessibility to electricity and
quality internet usage for research and personal study. In some
developing countries, undergraduates are often faced with lack
of complementary tools to help them learn more about the
fields of bioinformatics and computational biology in their
various institutions. Some useful mobile-related, online and
stand-alone bioinformatics and computational biology research
tools have been developed in the past 
[–]. In this paper, using
computational techniques, we developed a stand-alone mobile
multi-platform application, to assist undergraduates and
upcoming scientists from developing countries, have real-time
mobile access to key-terms and gain more knowledge in
computational biology and bioinformatics. This novel tool
(MACBenAbim) is to complement existing educational materials
in these fields and also motivate students and researchers from
developing nations undertake future study and research in
bioinformatics and computational biology. Thus, MACBenAbim
can be introduced to students and researchers of developing
countries as one of the strategies for promoting effective
bioinformatics and computational biology education and
research in such countries.

Methodology
MACBenAbim was implemented using Java Script for the
functionalities. HTML 5 was used to develop the page contents.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) were used for styling; PhoneGap
was used to implement the multi-platform visualization
characteristics of the software. LocalStorage was used for data
storage and retrieval. Relevant literatures were consulted to
obtain the definition and meanings of key-terms in
computational biology and bioinformatics and duly referenced.
The flowchart for MACBenAbim is illustrated in ().

Software Input
MACBenAbim a user-friendly interactive mobile tool, used for
understanding the definitions and meanings of key-terms in
bioinformatics and computational biology. MACBenAbim
accepts input as the bioinformatics or computational biology
term to be checked in the mobile application. It also has the
flexibility of allowing users to add new key-terms, edit existing
key-terms, delete wrongly entered key-terms and also update
existing keyterms.

Software Output
MACBenAbim produces instant results through a notification
dialog in a mobile device. Its output (which include the
definitions and meanings of key-terms in bioinformatics and
computational biology), can be viewed on multiple mobile
platforms such as BlackBerry, IPad, IPod-touch as well as
Android devices. For this paper, we show the output as
displayed on an Android phone as illustrated in ().

Caveats &amp; Future Development
MACBenAbim has presently been developed as a stand-alone
mobile application. We are currently developing a web based
CGI (common gateway interface) for MACBenAbim.

Flowchart of MACBenAbim

(A) shows the modification of the meaning of a gene
in MACBenAbim revealing the definition of a gene as stored in
its database; (B) shows an alert notifying that gene record has
been modified and updated within MACBenAbim; (C) reveals
the new definition of a gene after successful modification within
MACBenAbim; (D) shows the operations of the delete function
within the MACBenAbim mobile application. Here, the record
genetics will be deleted; (E) shows the deletion of the record
genetics within MACBenAbim after confirmation; (F) shows the
GUI (Graphical User Interface) and homepage of
MACBenAbim as displayed on the screen of a SAMSUNG
Android mobile device. The GUI consists of the Write, Retrieve,
Modify, and Delete function buttons within MACBenAbim.
