Background
Proteins evolve in response to the nature of interaction and
stability. Hydrophobic force considered to be the major force
involved in protein folding and action. Carbon is the element
contributes towards this dominant force. Arrangement of this
carbon along the sequence depends on how the amino acids are
organized. Recent studies on this matter find that proteins
prefer to have 31.45% of carbon [,
] for stability in its structure
and sequence. Given this standard, a carbon analysis program
[] has been developed to study the carbon distribution profile
of protein sequences. This is not sensitive to single amino acid
level. However it program can be used to see carbon along the
sequence []. This program helps in identification of ligand
binding sites [,
] and to understand the problem of proteinprotein
and protein-DNA interactions []. However protein
disorders in a short stretch of sequence and possible mutations
are not possible to predict. It is reported that allotment of
carbon along the sequence is responsible for disorders in
proteins []. With this idea and carbon scale, a new program
CARd has been developed for sensitive measure of
hydrophobic quantity at amino acid level.

Methodology
Dataset:
The sample sequence of super oxide dismutase (SOD) was
taken from Swissprot database. The UniprotKB ID number of
the protein is P00441.

Method:
The flow diagram () outlines how the distribution of
inner lengths based on carbon fraction is counted in a outer
length. The pink coloured sequence is protein sequence which
is converted into atomic sequence (shown in multiple colours
(red+blue+pink). The red portion is an inner length. The blue
portions are outer length which includes the red portion as
well. The entire atomic sequences are given in pink colour
which includes both blue and red. Here the outer and inner
lengths are taken as 100 and 35 atoms. There are 65 (100-35)
inner lengths for statistics. These 65 inner lengths are grouped
based on carbon fraction. The C11 has (11/35) 0.31 carbon
fraction. The flow chart () on the other side shows how
the algorithm works in calculation. A program has been written
to do all this calculations. The program reads the protein
sequence, converts into atomic sequence, takes a length
(anything from 77 to 700 atoms) of sequence, split into small
lengths (from 32 to -350 atoms) of equal sizes, finds fraction of
carbon atoms in all this small lengths and counts number of
small lengths that contain a defined fraction of carbon. There
are small lengths with 0.25 / 0.45 carbon but maximum at
around 0.31. A distribution of range of small lengths based on
carbon fraction appears like a normal distribution curve. This
distribution curve is obtained for all possible outer length. The
outer lengths can be any length between 77 and 700
corresponds to 5 and 45 amino acids. Any outer length chosen
between 100 and 150 atoms is sufficient for most of the
observations. Here it is chosen as 150 in all calculations. The
inner length can be between 32 and 350 which are not exceeding
half of the outer length. Inner length of 35 atoms is chosen here
in all calculations as it is the smallest unit with 11 carbons
which can produce fraction of 0.31. The outer length is moved
with step value of selected atoms. Normally it is half of the
outer length. Here it is 75 atoms as the outer length is 150. A
carbon distribution profile is obtained for all possible outer
length.

Generally normal profiles will have a Gaussian distribution
curve with maximum frequency at 0.3145. Any shift from this
maximum is considered as hydrophilic (negative side) or
hydrophobic (positive side). Difference in normal distribution is
considered as disordered outer length which contains improper
amino acid distribution. When the outer length contains a
proper arrangement of amino acids then there is normal
distribution. That is improper arrangements can be identified
from this calculations means that a stretch of sequence which
are hydrophobic or hydrophilic or unstable can be predicted.
The statistical mean, median, mode and standard deviation of
the distribution profile curve can be obtained to check whether
the distribution is normal or not. While the mean, median and
mode are equal for a given stretch, it is considered as normal
distribution. Then the stretch of sequence is in proper mode of
arrangement. CARd program computes for every (outer length)
distribution profile and prints at the end of the profile results.
CARd, the flexible program has option to output mean, median,
mode and standard deviation at every amino acid site. It also
gives simple average carbon fraction at an amino acid site and
for given output length. This replaces our earlier CARBANA
program [] 
for carbon analysis. A plot of mean value versus
amino acid number can be plotted. This plot is to see the overall
hydrophobic or hydrophilic regions in the sequence. It is similar
to hydropathy plot.

Discussion
Carbon distribution profile:
CARd analysis is carried out for super oxide dismutase
sequence. An outer length of 150 atoms and inner length of 35
atoms are used. The carbon distribution plot () is
obtained for every outer length with a gap of 75 atoms. The
plots show the frequency versus carbon fraction. Each plot is
labeled with the range of amino acids involved in the particular
outer length. The first plot shows distribution profile for first 10
amino acids and the next one is for 11 amino acids from 6 to 16.
Third outer length is from 10 to 21 amino acids and 11 amino
acids long. This way the distribution plot till last possible outer
length is obtained. Each plot shows a different distribution
profile. Outer lengths 72-82, 77-88, 82-93, 88-99, 114-123, 119-129
and 141-152 are having normal distribution and considered as
stable regions. Outer lengths 88-99, 114-123 and 129-141 are in
perfect distribution. Amino acids in these lengths are arranged
with perfect carbon distribution. Outer lengths 93-104 and 99-
110 are in order based on carbon distribution but hydrophobic
in nature. Outer lengths 50-63, 110-119, 123-135, 129-141 and
135-146 are having normal carbon distribution but hydrophilic.
Similarly the outer lengths 56-68, 63-72, 68-77 and 104-114 are
hydrophilic plus disorder. Infact 56-68, 63-72 and 68-77 are
metal binding sites. There are metal binding sites such as 46-56,
77-88, 82-93 and 114-123 are having normal carbon distribution.
The outer length 50-63 and 56-68 has a disulphide bond that
stabilise the structure but carbon distribution is not in order.
The disordered outer lengths need to be taken for mutational
study. Similar plot on abnormal proteins reveal that most of the
stretches are in disrorder regions. So this carbon distribution
analysis program can find disordered proteins, small stretch
that are disorder and amino acid responsible for disorder.This
mathod is sensitive to single amino acid level. This can be better
exploited for mutational study leading to stabilisation of
proteome.

Mean median, mode and standard deviation of the distribution profile:
The statistical mean, median, mode and standard deviation of
the distribution curve obtained for SOD. The results are not
shown. It gives output of average carbon fraction, mean,
median with mode and standard deviation of the distribution
profile at every amino acid position as shown in 
 (see
supplementary material). This is achieved by selecting step size
of suitable atoms. A plot of amino acid number versus mean
values can be obtained to identify the hydrophobic or
hydrophilic regions along the sequence. This is similar to
CARBANA output on average carbon fraction along the
sequence.

Conclusion
CARbon distribution (CARd) analysis program has been
developed to capture the hydrophobic/hydrophilic regions in
proteins. The calculations are precise and sensitive to single
amino acid change. This program is hoped to help in mutational
studies leading to protein stabilisation. It can capture the
essence of hydrophobicity in small stretch of sequence.

CARd program.

CARd analysis on SOD protein with 150 atoms (10
amino acid) of outer length and 35 atoms of inner length. Gap
between each outer length is chosen as75 atoms. The individual
plots are frequency versus carbon fraction for the short stretch
labeled. For example the first plot is for first 10 amino acids, the
second one is for residues 6-16, third one is for residues 10-21
and so on. The distribution plot is shown till last possible outer
length. Each plot shows a different distribution curve. If the
distribution plot is normal and maximum frequency at 0.3145,
then the particular stretch is normal and stable (e.g. 77-88 and
88-99). When the curve is normal and shifted to left or right
then the stretch is a hydrophilic (e.g. 125-146) or hydrophobic
(e.g. 10-21) region. If the distribution in not normal then it is
disordered region (e.g. 104-114).
