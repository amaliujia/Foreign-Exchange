Bioinformation describes the collection of biological data points on the molecular biology of 
    cell structure, growth, development, differentiation, division and function. Collection of biological 
    data points require simple to complex analysis of small, medium and large scale data describing cell 
    structures and events. These data points are derived by knowledge discovery technologies of basic 
    rules. Therefore, ‘BIOINFORMATION’ will act as a forum to discuss the mounting 
    scientific imperative to study biological systems at multiple levels of cellular and molecular 
    organization. In this process, it is important to standardize data representation, minimize data 
    duplication and maximize cellular information for accurate knowledge accumulation. The generated 
    knowledge will serve as input variables for biomedical modeling and simulation. I hope this forum 
    will help to discuss the following issues in a fruitful manner.
      standardize data formats;

debate on gene nomenclature;

derive new data points;

tease old data points using new data points;

glean new data points from old data points;

derive tertiary data points from secondary data points;

minimize data duplication;

maximize knowledge accumulation
