Background
Functional antibodies have been extensively used in pharmaceutical and clinical applications. Antibodies have a typical structure consisting of two identical 
			heavy and light chains joined together by disulfide and non-covalent bonds. Fv (variable fragment) plays a role in the antigen-binding activities of an 
			immunoglobulin molecule. It is the smallest unit of immunoglobulin and is easily manipulated for immunological application. [,,] ScFv (single-chain variable 
			fragment) refers to the antibody fragments consisting of VH (heavy) and VL (light) chains connected by a peptide linker. [,,]

ScFvs are commonly constructed from hybridoma, mouse immunoglobulin, sheep immunoglobulin [], 
			chicken immunoglobulin [,] and human antibody repertoire. 
			[,] They are generally produced at large scales using 
			genetically engineered cloning vectors in bacterial hosts. [] The most widely used peptide linker 
			in scFv construction consists of a 15 residues sequence with repeats (Gly4Ser)3. The linker provides the molecule with a flexibility to move approximately 
			35 to 40 â„« between the carboxy terminal of the VH and the amino terminus of the VL chains. [,] It should be noted that the affinity and stability of the scFv antibodies containing the (Gly4Ser)3 residues 
			are generally comparable to those of the native antibody. [] However, in some other antibody classes, 
			the linker is made of residues GLU and LYS and they have a role in the solubility enhancement of scFv. [] The stability and affinity is mainly contributed by disulfide bond linkers in these molecules. [,] Despite availability of several scFv structures at the PDB, the anti-CMV scFv structure 
			is not known. In this report, we describe sequencing, GenBank data submission, modelling of an anti-CMV scFv antibody.

Methodology
Plasmid Extraction and sequencing
Plasmid DNA of the anti-CMV ScFv antibody clone was prepared from bacterial culture using QIAGEN plasmid mini kit and subjected to sequencing using an ABI 
			3770 automated sequencer. The obtained sequences were then submitted to GenBank (AY337618 and AY337619).

Anti-CMV ScFv antibody sequence
The nucleotide sequences were then translated into protein sequences using the TRANSLATE program at Expasy. []

Sequence database search
Sequence database search for VH (variable heavy chain) and VL (variable light chain) was performed using the BLAST program at NCBI. [,]

Expression analysis
The expression of a 32 kDa recombinant antibody in bacteria was verified using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoassay) and western blot.

CDR (complementarity determining regions)
The CDR regions in the anti-CMV ScFv were determined using KABAT numbering [] and their canonical structures were determined using Chothia 
			description. [,]

Homology modeling and energy minimization
SWISS-MODEL was used to model VH and VL chains separately. [,
			,,] The VH and VL models were then connected by a 
			synthetic peptide [(Gly4Ser)3] using BUILDER/Insight II [] followed by energy minimization in a CFF91 
			force field.

Results and Discussion
A phage display technology was successfully carried out to develop an anti-CMV scFv recombinant antibody as an alternative to the tedious and time-consuming 
			hybridoma development. The approximately 700 bp scFv gene was successfully constructed and expressed in bacteria. [] We then sequenced the anti-CMV scFv gene and deposited the sequence at GenBank (AY337618 and AY337619). A number of scFv structures at 
			PDB (www.rcsb.org/pdb) and general information on antigen binding are well document. However, different scFv molecules from varying sources have different antigen 
			binding functional properties in quantitative measures. Therefore, it is our particular interest to probe specifically into the structure of an anti-CMV scFv antibody, 
			whose structure is not known. The GenBank submitted VH and VL chains of an anti-CMV scFv antibody with translated protein sequence are shown in . A total of six CDRs (three in each chain) are identified using KABAT numbering and are highlighted in BOLD ().

The distribution of CDRs in different regions of the VH and VL sequences is insightful, yet limited due to lack of 3D information. Hence, we searched the 
			anti-CMV scFv protein sequence against PDB (protein database) using BLASTP to identify suitable templates for homology modelling (). PDB search results show a high sequence similarity (82%) a synthetic peptide. Thus, the availability of a structural homolog at PDB was 
			confirmed. We then submitted the anti-CMV scFv antibody sequence to SWISS-MODEL and the VH and VL structures were separately modelled. The models are represented 
			in ribbons generated using RasMol [] in . The canonical 
			conformations for CDRs in anti-CMV scFv are mapped in 3D and mapped regions are shown in . The individually 
			modelled VH and VL structures were linked by a synthetic peptide [(Gly4Ser)3] using BUILDER/Insight II []
		    followed by energy minimization in CFF91 force field. The modeled anti-CMV scFv structure is represented in CPK model and CDRs mapped. Thus, the structure of an 
		    anti-CMV scFv was modeled and CDRs mapped to the structure in 3D. However, the regions of CDR involved in antigen-binding are not known for anti-CMV scFv. 
		    Therefore, further studies are required to identify the antigen binding CDRs.

Conclusion
The anti-CMV scFv antibody gene was sequenced and the sequence submitted to GenBank. To gain functional insight, the scFv antibody structure was modelled 
			using SWISS-MODEL and Insight II. The CDRs in the modelled antibody structure were determined by KABAT numbering and mapped to provide insight for further 
			epitope analysis. Thus, the identification and elucidation of CDRs in the anti-CMV scFv antibody is demonstrated using commonly available Bioinformatics tools 
			and techniques.
