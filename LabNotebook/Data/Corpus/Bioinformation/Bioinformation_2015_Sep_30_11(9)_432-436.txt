tend to be functionally related and work together to perform a specific biological function. Therefore, it is of interest to relate
disease phenotype data to mirror modular property implied in the association map of disease genes. Hence, we constructed a textbased
human disease gene network (HDGN) by using the phenotypic similarity of their associated disease phenotype records in
the OMIM database. Analysis shows that the network is highly modular and it is highly correlated with the physiological
classification of genetic diseases. Using a graph clustering algorithm, we found 139 gene modules in the network of 1,865 genes and
their gene products (proteins) in these gene modules tend to interact with each other via the computation of PPI intensity. Genes in
such gene modules are functionally related and may represent the shared genetic basis of their corresponding diseases. These
genes, alone or in combination, could be considered as potential therapeutic targets in future clinical therapy.

Background
When used together with genetic information, phenotype data
can help to explore relationships between genetic diseases and
mutation-bearing genes [1]. However, phenotype data such as
Online Mendelian Inheretance in Man (OMIM) [2] and
PhenomicDB [3] remain intractable to be deal with because the
lack of a standardized vocabulary for the phenotype
description. Despite these difficulties, there exists some
successful groundwork in utilizing such daunting phenotype
data. For example, Freudenberg et al. 
[4] clustered nearly 1,000
disease phenotypes of known genetic origin from OMIM
according to their phenotypic similarity using periodicity,
etiology, tissue, age of onset and mode of inheritance as
classification indices. Their results showed that genes causing
similar disease phenotypes have similar Gene Ontology (GO)
functional annotation. Groth et al. 
[5] used text clustering to
group genes based on their phenotype data from PhenomicDB.
The results indicated that these clusters correlate with several
indicators for biological coherence in gene groups, such as GO
functional annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI).
Both the investigations revealed a fact that genes associated
with similar disease phenotypes are more likely to be
functionally related. These related genes work together, as a
functional module, such as protein complex and cell pathway,
to perform a specific biological function [6]. The functional
relationship in these related genes are in agreement with the
modular property of most biological networks, indicating the
existence of densely-connected subgraphs in the gene
functional network.

In this study, we constructed a functional network of human
disease genes, and further investigated its modular property.
We determined the association between disease genes in the
network by using their phenotypic relatedness. The human
disease gene network (HDGN) has been proved to have a high
modular architecture. From the network, we extracted 139 gene
modules and found the modularity correlates with the
functional level of PPI. Of these 139 gene modules, 127 (91.4%)
were significantly enriched in only one disease class or two.
Therefore, our network-based framework revealed that disease
genes and the associated genetic diseases have a high level of
agreement in functional interplay, although they are at two
different biological levels.

Methodology
Disease phenotype similarity measure:
In OMIM, we considered the combination of text (TX) and
clinical synopsis (CS) fields as a full phenotype record.
Phenotype records were parsed by the MetaMap Transfer tool
[7], 
a configurable program to map text to the Unified Medical
Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts [8]. Thus,
phenotype records could be referred to as phenotype feature
vectors. In this work, we used the term frequency–inverse
document frequency weighting scheme [9] for the refinement of
phenotype feature vectors and the cosine similarity measure for
calculating the phenotypic similarity between different
phenotype records.

Construction of HDGN:
Inspired by the fact that genes associated with similar disease
phenotypes are likely to be functionally related, we used the
phenotypic relatedness to decide the functional relatedness of
disease genes. The association between two disease genes in
HDGN was decided when the phenotypic similarity score of
their associated disease phenotypes exceeded the significant
cutoff. The cutoff was chosen based on the random shuffling of
the phenotype feature vectors of the two disease phenotypes
and similarity score ranking.

Modular measure:
We used two modular measures, dyadicity D and
heterophilicity H, whch were proposed by Park et al. 
[10], to
quantify the modular property of HDGN. Dyadicity is a
measure of the enrichment of links between nodes sharing a
common property over the number expected if the
characteristics were distributed randomly on the network.
Heterophilicity is a measure of the tendency of nodes to
connect with other nodes with a common property. In HDGN,
disease genes with their associated disease phenotypes
belonging to the same disease class were regarded to have the
common property. Thus, we can compute the Ds and Hs for
different disease classes.

Gene modules exaction and evaluation:
We used the graph clustering algorithm [11] to extract gene
modules from HDGN. Here, a module denotes a set of
biological individuals (e.g., gene, protein) in a certain biological
network, such as gene regulatory network and PPI network. To
evaluate the functional relations of genes in gene modules, we
introduced the PPI intensity Ippi. Ippi was defined as the fraction
of actual existing PPIs among the possible maximum number of
PPIs in a gene module i, and therefore it can be formulated as:

Ippi = Nactual (k(k -1) 2)

Where Nactual is the actual existing PPI number between gene
products in gene module, k is the number of gene products in
this gene module which can be found having interactions with
others in the Human Protein Reference Database [12].

Disease class enrichment analysis:
Disease class enrichment analysis was implemented to explore
the enrichment of gene module in a disease class. The
framework was executed like this: i) for a gene module, we
randomly picked from all the disease genes and built 10,000
pseudo gene modules that have the same number of disease
genes as the real gene module , ii) in the real gene module, the
possible disease classes of the associated disease phenotypes
are determined and the number of disease phenotypes
belonging to each certain disease class is counted and iii) the Pvalues
for every possible disease class determined in the real
gene module are computed based on the random controls.

Results
HDGN has a highly modular property:
We collected all the known 1,865 disease genes from OMIM
and constructed HDGN which contains 21,514 links among
1,685 disease genes, with a giant connected component of 1,607
(99.36%) disease genes and 21,428 (98.9%) links (Figure 1). In
the network, disease gene nodes were marked with different
colors based on the assigned disease classes of their associated
disease phenotypes. Here, we referred to the disease
classification, described by Gol et al. 
[13], who manually
classified disease phenotypes into 22 main disease classes
according to the physiological system affected. It is visually
indicative that disease genes with their associated disease
phenotypes belonging to the same disease class tend to group
together forming different modular structures in the network.
Table 1 (see supplementary material) listed the two modular
measures: dyadicity D and heterophilicity H for the 22 disease
classes. The fact that HDGN has a highly modular structure can
be proved by the finding that all the disease classes are dyadic
(D&gt;1) and most (77.27%) are heterophobic (H&lt;1), together
indicating a high correlation between the modularity and the
physiological classification of disease phenotypes.

Gene products in a gene module tend to interact with each other:
Of the total 139 gene modules extracted from HDGN, 14 gene
modules have the Ippi=0 because none of their members has
interactions with others in the HPRD. Of the remainder, 9 gene
modules have the Ippi=1 and the others have the Ippi of 0-1.
Finally, we got the mean Ippi is 0.34. To test the statistical
significance of the obtained mean Ippi, 139 gene sets of the same
size as the corresponding gene modules were chosen from all
the disease genes as a random control. We built 10,000 such
random controls and the result showed that the mean Ippi is
significantly higher than that of random groups (P-value=2.5e-
3), indicating that gene products in a gene module have a
tendency to interact with each other and be part of the same
biological process; that is, these gene products may serve
together, as a fundamental functional unit of biological system,
to participate in the same cellular pathway or molecular
complex.

Gene modules tend to enrich in certain disease classes:
We referred to the disease class annotations described by Gol et
al. [13] to conduct disease class enrichment analysis. The result
showed that 113 (81.3%) gene modules were significantly
enriched in only one of the 22 disease classes, 14 (10.1%) gene
modules in two disease classes and 12 (8.6%) gene modules in
three or more disease classes. Our statistical results also
indicated that the associated disease phenotypes of a given
gene module tend to belong to the same disease class 
(Figure 2). Taking together, the vast majority (91.4%) of gene modules
have significant specificity to certain disease classes, indicating
that these gene modules represent shared genetic origin of the
associated diseases, and that genes in a given gene module may
be used as a proxy of related diseases in future clinical therapy.

Discussion
The network modeling method presented here revealed an
obvious modular property in HDGN. In the network, the edge
between two disease genes represents a measure of their
phenotypic relatedness; thus the modularity supports the
existing modular organization in genetic diseases [14], which is
manifested as similar diseases are often caused by functionally
related genes. Our findings also showed that disease genes and
their associated genetic diseases have a high level of agreement
in functional interplay. We believe such functional agreement
will prompt the integrative analysis of different levels of
biological data. For example, the phenotypic relatedness
measure of two genes in HDGN can be considered, combined
with gene expression, PPI and GO annotation, to predict
candidate genes in an integrated network way.

The measure of gene interactions in HDGN is less quantitative
due to the daunting nature of disease phenotype data. In this
situation, a weighted HDGN should be considered so that the
network is more informative and fit for graph-based clustering
algorithm. With increasing amounts of disease phenotype data
available, we can construct a more complete map of human
disease genes, which make it feasible to investigate the
associations among genome, interactome, phenome and other
level of omics. We believe these attempts can inform our
understanding of the relationship between human diseases and
the underlying genetic mechanisms, and further help to
uncover pathophysiologic foundations of most genetic diseases.

Conclusion
We constructed a gene network of 1,865 genes for known
diseases called HDGN based on a text-based association
determination scheme according to the phenotypic similarity.
Disease phenotype data provides a valuable window for
dissecting genotype–phenotype associations. Thus, text-based
similarity should be a potentially suitable measure for deciding
disease gene interactions in HDGN. In addition, HDGN
provides a disease-gene-centered sight of disease association
map. Hence, it is possible to explore the molecular mechanisms
underlying genetic diseases. Genes in 139 gene modules
extracted from the network have been demonstrated to
functionally interact and the associated disease phenotypes are
clinically similar. This observation suggested that related genes
cooperate to perform desired cellular functions contributing to
certain disease phenotypes. This finds application in target
selection and validate during drug discovery.
