AutoDock 4.2 as the docking software application. AutoDock 4.2 software serves as a valid and acceptable docking application to
study the interactions of small compounds with proteins. Interactions of curcumin with MMP-3 were compared to those of two
known inhibitors of the enzyme, PBSA and MPPT. The calculated free energy of binding (ΔG binding) shows that curcumin binds
with affinity comparable to or better than the two known inhibitors. Binding interactions of curcumin with active site residues of
the enzyme are also predicted. Curcumin appears to bind in an extendended conformation making extensive VDW contacts in the
active site of the enzyme. Hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions with key active site residues is also observed. Thus, curcumin
can be considered as a good lead compound in the development of new inhibitors of MMP-3 which is a potential target of anticancer
drugs. The results of these studies can serve as a starting point for further computational and experimental studies.

Background
Curcumin is the major active component of turmeric, a yellow
colored spice isolated from the plant Curcuma longa. It is a
member of the curcuminoid family and has been used for
centuries in traditional medicines. Curcumin has also long been
part of the daily diet in Asian countries and has not been
shown to cause any toxicity [1]. Extensive research over the
past 30 years has indicated that this molecule has therapeutic
potential against a wide range of diseases, such as cancer, lung
diseases, neurological diseases, liver diseases, metabolic
diseases, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and
various other inflammatory diseases [2,
3]. Numerous lines of
evidence indicate that curcumin possesses anti-inflammatory
[4–5], 
hypoglycemic [7,
8], antioxidant 
[9], wound healing 
[10],
and anti-microbial activities [11]. Many clinical trials using
curcumin as a therapeutic agent are under way [12].

Curcumin is a functionally labile molecule with the potential to
modulate the biological activity of a number of target molecules
either indirectly or directly by binding through different
bonding interactions. Various biophysical tools have been
employed to show direct interaction of curcumin with target
proteins. Some of these studies have utilized molecular docking
as a computational tool to study the mode and site of binding.
For most of the proteins, the binding of curcumin to the protein
has been detected with a binding constant typically in the
nanomolar to micromolar range. Curcumin׳s ability to bind
directly to diverse proteins with high affinity stems from its
molecular structure and functionality. Chemically, curcumin is
a diferuloyl methane molecule (1,7-bis (4-hydroxy-3-
methoxyphenol)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione) containing two
ferulic acid residues joined by a methylene bridge.Curcumin
has two hydrophobic phenyl domains that are connected by a
flexible linker Table 1 (see supplementary material), and
molecular docking studies have found that curcumin can adopt
many different conformations suitable for maximizing
hydrophobic contacts with the protein to which it is bound.
Within curcumin׳s generally hydrophobic structure, the
phenolic and carbonyl functional groups, which are located on
the ends and in the center of the molecule, can participate in
hydrogen bonding with a target macromolecule. This structure
provides a strong and directed electrostatic interaction to
increase favorable free energies of association. Owing to its bdiketone
moiety, curcumin undergoes keto–enol tautomerism
and exists entirely in the enol form both in solution and in solid
phase [13,
14]. This keto–enol tautomerization provides
curcumin with additional chemical functionality. The
predominant enol form allows the midsection of the molecule
to both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. The enol form also
makes an ideal chelator of positively charged metals, which are
often found in the active sites of target proteins 
[15]. The
combination of hydrophobic interactions, including p–p
interactions, extensive hydrogen bonding, metal chelation, and
covalent bonding, covering such a large surface area gives
curcumin many possible mechanisms to interact with target
proteins.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) constitute a family of zincdependent,
calcium-containing endoproteinases involved in
tissue remodelling. Several MMPs (MMP-1 to MMP-28) have
been identified thus far. MMPs׳ ability to cleave and remodel
surrounding tissue components effects activities such as cell
migration, differentiation, growth, inflammatory processes,
neovascularisation, wound healing, apoptosis, uterine cycle,
embryonic development, ovulation etc. [16]. Numerous matrix
and non-matrix proteins are potential substrates for MMPs 
[17].
MMPs, furthermore, play a role in a number of pathological
processes such as arthritis, Alzheimer׳s disease, central nervous
system disease, liver cirrhosis and pro-angiogenic activities in
malignant tumours. [16, 
18–20]. The activity of these enzymes
is, thus, of great interest in tissue remodelling, both in
physiological and disease processes.

Generally, the structure of MMPs consists of four distinct
domains: an N-terminal pro-domain (propeptide ~ 80 AS)
cleaved during activation, a catalytic domain (~180 AS)
including a conserved HEXXHXXGXXH zinc binding motif, a
hinge region and a C−terminal hemopexin − like domain (~250
AS). Some MMPs (the membrane type) contain an additional
transmembrane domain that anchors them in the cell surface
[21,
22]. The catalytic domain is folded into a single globular
unit approximately 35 Å in diameter and the structure is
dominated by a single five − stranded beta–sheet with one
antiparallel and four parallel strands and three alpha- helices.
The propeptide of MMP-3 makes up a separate smaller domain,
approximately 20 Å in diameter that contains three alphahelices
and an extended peptide that occupies the active site.
The catalytic domain contains two tetrahedrally − coordinated
Zn2+ ions: a “structural” zinc ion and a “catalytic” zinc ion
whose ligands include the side chains of the three histidyl
residues in the signature HEXXHXXGXXH sequence. The
catalytic domains also contain 1-3 Ca2+ ions. C- terminal to the
final His residue in the catalytic zinc site is another conserved
sequence containing a Met residue. This residue is in a tight
turn just below the catalytic zinc ion [23]. The active site
consists of two distinct regions: a groove in the protein surface,
centered on the catalytic zinc ion and an S1 specificity site that
varies considerably among members of the family. Bound
inhibitors adopt extended conformations within the groove,
make several hydrogen bonds with the enzyme and provide
the fourth ligand for the catalytic zinc ion. The S1 subsite
apparently plays a significant role in determining the substrate
specificity in the active enzymes. The volume of this subsite
varies widely, with a relatively small hydrophobic site in MMP−
7 and MMP-1 as compared with a very large site in MMP-8 and
a site that extends all the way through the MMP-3 molecule,
open to solution at both ends [24].

Because of their involvement in vital physiological processes
and their association with several diseases, MMPs are
considered important drug targets. Numerous synthetic
inhibitors are under investigation for their inhibitory activity
towards the MMPs. Some of the classes of these inhibitors are −
succinyl hydroxamates, sulphonamide hydroxamates,
carboxylic acid zinc binding groups, some natural products etc.
[25].

Due to the difficulties and economic cost of the experimental
methods for determining the structures of complexes,
computational methods such as molecular docking are desired
for predicting putative binding modes and affinities. Significant
progress has been made in docking research to improve the
computational speed and accuracy. Among them, proteinligand
docking is a particularly vibrant research area because of
its importance to structure-based drug design 
[26–32]. The
present study incorporates results of in silico binding of
curcumin with the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (Human
Stromelysin-1). The binding is compared to the binding of two
know inhibitors of the enzyme, IN7 and HQQ. The catalytic
domain of MMP-3 (Human Stromelysin-1) is referred to as SCD.

Methodology
Version 4.2 of the molecular docking software AutoDockR 
[33],
obtained from The Scripps Research Institutes, San Diego, CA,
USA, was used in this study. AutoDock Tools [ADTR] [33,
34]
obtained from the same source was used as the GUI for
AutoDockR 4.2 and for preparation of the protein and ligand for
docking.

Preparation of protein and ligand:
The three dimensional structures of SCD, IN7 and HQQ were
obtained from the PDB files1BBY, 1BBY and 1G4K, respectively.
The structural coordinates of CUR (ID: ACD0022) were
obtained from the database of anticancer molecules, ACD.
Chemical structures of the three ligands are shown in 
Table 1
(see supplementary material). For docking experiments, the
protein and the ligands were prepared using ADTR. Gestgeiger
partial charges were assigned after merging nonpolar
hydrogens. Torsions were applied to the ligand by rotating all
rotatable bonds. Protein was kept rigid. Both the protein and
the ligand coordinates were saved in the PDBQT format files
which were used as input files for docking experiments in the
next step.

Docking:
With AutoDockR 4.2, standard docking procedures for a rigid
protein and a flexible ligand were used as per the user guide. A
grid of 60×60×60 points in x, y, and z directions was built with a
grid spacing of 0.375 Å using the AutoGrid component of the
software. A distance dependent function of the dielectric
constant was used for the calculation of the electrostatics map.
Default settings were used for all other parameters. Lamarckian
Genetic Algorithm [LGA] [35] was employed for docking
simulations. LGA was implemented by creating an initial
population of 150 individuals, applying random torsions to
each of the 150 individuals, and performing a maximum of
2500000 energy evaluations in each docking run. At least 20
such runs were performed for all ligands. At the end of
docking, the best binding modes were analyzed for various
interactions using ADTR and RasMolR (Roger Sayle) 
[36]
programs.

Results &amp; Discussion
All the binding parameters of CUR, IN7 and HQQ obtained
after docking are listed in Table 2 (see supplementary
material). Estimates of total free energy of binding of the three
inhibitors were -10.2, -9.56 and -9.96 kcal/mol, respectively. The
estimated KI values were 3.6 × 10-8, 9.8 × 10-8 and 5.0 × 10-8,
respectively. The total free energy of binding [and hence the Ki]
estimated for CUR is slightly lower than these values for IN7
and HQQ suggesting comparable binding of CUR with the
enzyme. Comparisons of the best binding modes of CUR vs IN7
and CUR vs HQQ are shown in Figures 1 &amp; 2, respectively. The
interactions of IN7 and HQQ are very much similar to those of
CUR and hence the binding energies are comparable.

An analysis of the docked complex of CUR with SCD reveals
several significant interactions of the ligand within the active
site of SCD. Some of the important interactions are listed in
Table 3 (see supplementary material). Visual renderings of
these interactions constructed in RasMolR are shown in Figures
3 and 4. The ligand appears to bind in the active site in an
extended conformation and makes extensive van der Waals
contacts with the active site residues of the enzyme (Figures 3).
The two phenyl rings of CUR are in pi-pi stacking interaction
with the imidazole ring of His-201 on one side and with the
imidazole ring of His-224 and phenyl ring of Tyr-223 on the
other side of the active site pocket. Hydrogen bonding
interactions appear between one enol-OH of CUR midsection
with backbone O of Leu-218. Hydrogen bonds also seem to
form between phenolic-OH of CUR and backbone Ns of Leu-
164 and Ala-165. Some minor interactions are also seen that
have not been listed. The ligand appears to be stabilized in the
active site predominantly by the pi-pi stacking and VDW
interactions. These interactions appear to orient the ligand for
adequate H-bonding (Figures 4).

Docking analysis of curcumin derivatives THC and BDMC with
MMPs was performed in one study. Although both THC and
BDMC showed affinity to MMPs, BDMC had higher affinity
than THC. Further docking analysis revealed that the
interaction of BDMC with MMPs was associated with a
docking energy of 11.46 kcal/ mol and the formation of three
hydrogen bonds [37]. These docking analyses suggest that
curcumin and its derivatives have similar binding affinities and
modes as those of known inhibitors of the enzyme and
curcumin can be a potential starting molecule for the design of
anticancer drugs targeting the MMP enzymes.
