numerous synthetic antiviral medicines are available for influenza virus in the market. But still there was a need for the
development of drug which will target all the strains of influenza virus. For this purpose conserved residues within the influenza
virus NS1 protein have been found by aligning all the available sequences of existing strains from the national center of
biotechnology information(NCBI) protein database. The compounds from leaf extracts of neem (Azadirachta indica), previously
known to have antiviral properties, were virtually screened to identify side effects free natural drug. Molecular docking identified
eight potential compounds (Tetratriacontane, 127-40-2, 6-o-ACETYLNIMBANDIOL, Rutin, Tiplasinin, Hyperoside, ( )-
Nimocinolide and Quercitrin) found to have perfect binding with reported conserved residues (R19, R35, S42 and D39) of influenza
virus NS1 protein involved in the binding of drugs. From, further analysis 6-o-ACETYLNIMBANDIOL, Rutin and Tiplasinin were
found as drug against influenza strains because their binding residues were conserved in all strains. The potential of neem
chemical against influenza virus has best been highlighted through this study and it provides direction for further consideration of
these products for in-vivo and in-vitro validations.

Background
Influenza A viruses are common pathogens having high
variability that caused acute respiratory disease and resulted in
high death rates (20 to 40 million people) worldwide till 1918
[1]. The influenza A viruses (H5N1) are violently spreaded in
Southeast Asia in present years so they are robust candidates
for causing the flu pandemic [2]. Influenza is a significant
health problem due to its rapid transmission and high
mortality rate. Influenza is a respiratory infection caused by
the influenza virus [3] belonging to the family
Orthomyxoviridae. The virus has single stranded and
segmented RNA genome which encodes for 8 proteins. For the
propagation of influenza virus the NS1 protein, matrix (M1,
M2), neuraminidase (NA), hemagglutinin (HA) and three viral
polymerase subunits (PB1, PB2 and PA) plays an active role
[4]. Influenza virus is classified into three groups and has more
than 10 strains. Its genome is highly variable with many strains
having a high rate of mutation which make them resistant to
many drugs. Previously the disease was cured by either using
nucleic acid protein inhibitors (e.g. Zanamivir), neuraminidase
inhibitors (e.g. Zanamivir, Oseltamivir), ion channel blockers
(e.g. Amantadine, Rimantadine) or siRNA technique [5]. The
whole concept of the gene regulation and proteome function
can be used to predict antiviral drug target of projected motifs
of influenza A virus [6]. Host specific epitope of influenza A
virus surface proteins NA and HA, has been predicted which
could support in designing the drugs against Influenza virus
[7]. Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have been proved as an
efficient inhibitors of NA. Due to the mutation in the active site
of NA and HA, resistance of influenza virus against these
drugs has been reported [8].

Reasons for H5N1 subtype influenza A virus virulence is
unclear yet, but some causative aspects have been recognized.
The non-structural (NS) protein 1 is one of them [9]. The
transcription and replication of influenza virus RNAs took
place in the nucleus of the infected cells [10]. Genome of
influenza A viruses encoded ten to eleven viral proteins from
eight single-stranded negative sense RNA segments
depending on the strain. Except for NS1 and PB1F2, all others
were structural proteins. The NS1 and NS2 proteins were
translated from differential splicing mRNA of segment 8,
whereas NS2 was nuclear export protein. The RNA segment 8
of influenza A virus, had 890 nucleotides, which directed the
synthesis of 2 mRNAs in infected cells. The NS1 protein
consisted of 230 amino acids; while the other derived from
alternative splicing of NS1 mRNA was NS2 protein having 121
amino acids [11]. This RNA binding protein was involved in
controlling post transcriptional processing steps i.e Inhibition
of nuclear pass of mRNAs that contain 3׳ poly (A) and premRNA
splicing [12].

Medicinal plants are very important for treatment of different
diseases, mainly in the countries where there are insufficient
resources. Use of traditional medicines are mainly encouraged
in most of the world population [13]. These traditional
medicines have fewer side effects than other allopathic
medicines, one of the major reasons to isolate and process
these compounds from plants [14]. Azadirachta indica (neem) is
a medicinal plant and has grown universal importance in
recent years. Neem has been extensively used in Ayurveda,
Unani, and Homeopathic medicines. It has a huge range of
biologically active chemicals that are chemically and
structurally different. From different parts of this plant i.e.
flowers, leaves, seeds, roots, fruits and bark more than 140
chemically active compounds have been isolated and are being
used traditionally as a cure for many diseases. These active
compounds have been identified as an anti-inflammatory, antiulcer,
anti-hyperglycaemic, immune-modulatory, antimutagenic,
anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, and anti-viral
drugs [15].

Neem elements are mainly divided in two groups: Nonisoprenoids
and Isoprenoids. The non-isoprenoids comprise of 
proteins, sulphurous compounds, carbohydrates and
polyphenolics including dihydrochalcone, flavonoids,
coumarin, and aliphatic compounds. The isoprenoids consist
of di-terpenoids and tri-terpenoids which include azadirone,
protomeliacins, limonoids and some derivatives such as
nimbin, vilasinin, salanin and azadirachtin [13]. By an alcoholic
extract of neem leaves a dose dependent substantial decrease
in blood pressure has also been reported [16].

In the light of above debated medications by neem we
designed this study to screen Azadirachta indica (Neem) active
compounds against the influenza virus NS1 protein through
molecular docking to study their interaction pattern. It was
also observed that either these compounds were interacting
with conserved residues are not. From this study it was
concluded that either these compounds could be act as
competent drug.

Methodology
In-silico analysis of active chemicals of Azadirachta indica
(neem) leaves against influenza virus NS1 protein was carried
out. For this investigation, chemical structures of compounds
of neem leaves were retrieved in a MOL format from chemical
database PubChem available on NCBI website. Some of the
chemical compounds were drawn in MOL format in
Chemdraw software. NS1 protein structure (PDB ID: 2GX9)
used for docking purpose was downloaded from Protein Data
Bank (PDB) as shown in Figure 1. For molecular docking
analysis, Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software
was used [17].

Finding the NS1 protein conserved residues within and among the influenza strains:
In order to find the conserved residues of NS1 protein within
and among the strains of influenza virus active against
humans (i.e. H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, H7N2, H7N3,
H7N7, and H9N2), the available NS1 protein sequences of each
strain were retrieved from NCBI protein database. At first, the
retrieved NS1 protein sequences of each strain were aligned by
multiple alignment through Clustal Omega (
http:// www.ebi.ac.uk/ Tools/msa/clustalo/) to develop a consensus
sequence for each strain, then by using the CLC Genomics
Workbench 8 conserved residues within the strain were
identified. The conserved residue consensus sequences of all 
the strains were again aligned using the CLC Genomics
Workbench 8 to get the final conserved consensus sequence
among the above said strains (Figure 2).

Molecular Docking
Preparation of Protein Structure (Receptor):
Three-dimensional model of target protein of influenza virus
was retrieved from PDB [PDB ID: 2GX9, 2GX9 is a full-length
NS1 effector domain 3D model available in PDB. All the water
molecules were removed and hydrogen atoms were added by
using MOE software. Optimization of receptor molecule was
done by energy minimization and 3D protonation using
AMBER99 force field option of MOE. The gradient was 0.05
and receptor was minimized unless root mean square gradient
reached below 0.05. After that the receptor protein was 3D
protonated and then hydrogen molecules were hidden by
using hide molecule option. dsRNA binding site 5-50 residues
of NS1 protein were selected as a pocket site to destroy the
dsRNA binding activity of the NS1 protein. Surface and maps
option of MOE was used to point out the surface of the
docking site and pocket residues. This energy minimized and
3D protonated receptor molecules were then used for docking
analysis.

Preparation of ligand structure and construction of database:
The structures of biologically active compounds of neem
leaves were downloaded from the PubChem database in 2D
format Table 1 (see supplementary material). Some structures
of chemical compounds were not presented in the PubChem
database so their 2D structures were retrieved from literature
study and were drawn in 3D format by using ChemDraw
software. For preparation of ligand structures for docking,
hydrogen atoms were added to each ligand and their energy
was minimized by using the MMFF94X force field at 0.05
gradients. Then these ligand structures were saved in .mol2 file
format. The database was created and saved in .mdb format
which was used for docking against the target receptor
protein.

Docking analyses:
After preparation of receptor protein and ligand molecules,
molecular docking was executed against the databases
mentioned earlier. Docking output database file which
contains receptor ligand complex was saved in .mdb format.
The docked complexes were sorted with respect to increasing S
value (the final score to indicate binding free energy). The
complexes with minimum S were taken to evaluate the
interactions of ligand with the active site residues of the
receptor protein. The best hydrogen bonding and π-π
interactions were analyzed by the ligX option of MOE.

Results &amp; Discussion
Finding conserved residues within and among influenza virus NS1 protein:
To find the conserved residues in all the strains of influenza
virus (Figure 2), alignment was done by using the CLC
Genomics Workbench 8 as described earlier. In the Figure 2
conservation of residues is shown by vertical bars. The
alignment showed that NS1 protein is a moderate conserved
protein (43.47%).

Docking analyses against Azadirachta indica (neem) leaf chemicals :
Docking of influenza virus NS1 protein against Azadirachta
indica (neem) leaf chemicals resulted in 8 complex
conformations. Tetratriacontane showed least S-score and
interactions with the R21, V18, W16, and C13 residues of NS1
protein Table 2 (see supplementary material); 
Figure 3(1A &amp;
1B). The other eight compounds were also having a lower Sscore
and strong hydrogen bonds with multiple residues of the
NS1 protein Figure 3 (2A &amp; 3B). All these compounds showed
interactions with R19 residue of selected pocket of the NS1
protein. R44 showed interaction only with 4-
[(1E,3E,5E,7Z,9E,11E,13E,15E,17E)-18-(4-hydroxy-2,6,6-
trimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-3,7,12,16-tetramethyloctadeca-
1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17-nonaenyl]-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-3-en-1-
ol(127-40-2) while D39 showed the interactions with (127-40-2)
and ( )-Nimocinolide. S42 interacted with 2-(3,4-
dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-3-[(2S,3R,4R,5R,6S)-3,4,5-
trihydroxy-6-methyloxan-2-yl]oxychromen-4-one(Quercitrin)
and 2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5,7-dihydroxy-3-[(2S,3R,4S,5R,
6R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)oxan-2-
yl]oxychromen-4-one(Hyperoside). R35 was found in complex
with 2-[1-benzyl-5-[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl] indol-3-yl]-2-
oxoacetic(Tiplasinin) and R46 with ( )-Nimocinolide. 6-oACETYLNIMBANDIOL
Hyperoside and Quercitrin. 6-oACETYLNIMBANDIOL
and Rutin were having only one
interaction with R19.

Conserved residues of NS1 protein involved in interaction with Azadirachta indica (neem) leaf chemicals:
The docking showed that R21, V18, W16, C13, R19, S42, R44,
D39, R35 and R46 were residues involved in the interaction
with the neem leaf chemicals. W16, C13, R19, R35 and R46
were found to be conserved residues in the NS1 protein of
Influenza virus. D39 was deleted in H5N1 influenza strain.
From Table-2, it is obvious that 6-o-ACETYLNIMBANDIOL,
Rutin and Tiplasinin have shown strong interactions with only
R19 and R35, which both are conserved residues, so these
drugs can be used against influenza virus. ( )-Nimocinolide
was having interactions with R19, R46, D39. D39 was absent in
H5N1 influenza strain so, on the basis of these results its use as
antiviral drug against all the influenza virus strains except
H5N1 has been suggested. S43 was mutated with A42 in both
H7N2 and H7N3. So Quercitrin and Hyperoside can be used as
a drug except H7N2 and H7N3. S42 and A42 have similar
group and similar function so it is hypothesized that there is a
chance that both drugs can be used against H7N2 and H7N3
influenza strains.

Discussions
The alignment showed that NS1 protein is a moderate
conserved protein (43.47%). NS1 is not a conserved protein,
but it has many residues which are conserved in all the
Influenza strains. Docking analysis showed that interacting
compounds from neem mostly interacted with R19, which is a
conserved residue. R21, V18, W16, C13, R19, S42, R44, D39, R35
and R46 these residues of the NS1 protein were involved in
interaction with neem compounds. Tetratriacontane, 127-40-2,
Tiplasinin, Hyperoside, RUTIN, ( )-Nimocinolide, 6-oACETYLNIMBANDIOL
and Quercitrin were neem
compounds which gave best interacrions with NS1 of
influenza virus. From these compounds 6-oACETYLNIMBANDIOL,
Rutin and Tiplasinin were involved
in interaction only with conserved residues so they can be used
as drug against all the influenza strains.

One of interacting residue D39 of ( )-Nimocinolide was absent
in H5N1so, it cant be used against that strain. One of
interacting residue SER43 of Quercitrin and Hyperoside was
mutated with A42 in both H7N2 and H7N3 so, these both
drugs cannot be used against these strains.

All these interacting compounds were found to have antiviral
activities and were reported as Rutin has been reported
previously to have strong antiviral, antimicrobial and
antifungal activity [18]. Hyperoside also has antiviral activity
which is also previously reported against hepatitis B virus
(HBV) [19]. Nimbaflavone is also tested for antiviral activity
[20]. Thr5, Pro31, Asp34, R35, Arg38, Lys41, Gly45, R46 and
Thr49 are reported resides of NS1 protein involved in the
attachment of the dsRNA. R46 and R35 same residues, D39
and R44 neighboring residues involved in the interaction with
our reported drugs. So by using these drugs dsRNA binding
activity of the NS1 protein can be blocked [21,
22].

Due to this blockage NS1 protein will be unable to block the
activation of protrin kinase. phosphorylates the alpha subunit
of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (elF-2 alpha),
leading to a decrease in the rate of initiation of translation. In
the absence of NS1, this pathway is inhibited during anti-viral
response to halt all protein translation − thus stopping the
synthesis of viral proteins; however, the influenza virus' NS1
protein is an agent that circumvents host defenses to allow
viral gene transcription to occur.

Conclusion
Due to strain variations among influenza virus, it is the need of
the time to identify the conserved residues among different
strains as a target for drug discovery based on compounds
extracted from natural sources like the Azadirachta indica
(neem) leaves. For this study NS1 protein was selected and
screened against compounds extracted from neem leaves using
in-silico screening and molecular docking simulation
techniques. The compounds 6-o-ACETYLNIMBANDIOL,
Rutin, Tiplasinin, Hyperoside, ( )-Nimocinolide and Quercitrin
showed best interactions with conserved residues of the NS1
protein. So these compounds have been identified for holding
great potential for utilization as a drug against influenza
strains. These observations require further considerations for
in-vivo and in-vitro validations. The above reported drugs are
screened from natural source and are having less or no side
effect as compared to synthetic drug compounds. These
screened drugs can be further synthesized and validate in wet
lab against all the strains of Influenza virus.
