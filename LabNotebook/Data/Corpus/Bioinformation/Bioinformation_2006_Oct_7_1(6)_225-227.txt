Background
Integrated approaches to the study of abiotic stress response in plants are important especially since drought and salinity stress are primary reasons for 
			crop losses worldwide. The study of stress response pathways includes analysis of information from stress related metabolic and physiological changes, 
			comparative genomics, gene expression studies and structural, and functional data of stress proteins. Plants have stress specific adaptive responses as well as 
			responses which protect the plants from more than one environmental stress. Multiple stress perception and signaling pathways exist - some specific; others may 
			cross talk at various steps. [,] Identification of genes 
			related to stress is an important aspect in the study of plant response to abiotic stress. A minimal requirement to initiate a comparative genomics study across 
			abiotic stress conditions is a dataset of orthologs. The availability of a large amount of sequence information, especially that derived from cDNA libraries in 
			response to abiotic stress allows for the generation of a putative list of candidate genes using the orthologs approach. Orthologs are genes in different 
			species that have evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation and generally retain an equivalent or similar function in the course of evolution.

A high degree of sequence conservation across species and the availability of partial gene sequence data led to the development of comprehensive orthologous gene alignment such as 
			the TOGA (tentative orthologous gene alignments from EST datasets) [] and the COG (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) databases. 
			[,] The TOGA database currently contains 25 plant species while fewer plant species are 
			represented in the COG database. We report here the generation and availability of tentative orthologous annotated datasets for 16 economically important crop species that are vulnerable to the 
			abiotic stresses of heat, dehydration, cold and salt; and for which ESTs generated from stress cDNA libraries are available in the public domain. The aim in building the dataset is to provide users with 
			a catalogue of annotated sequences associated with abiotic stress, identify elements common to all conditions from those that differ, identify categories of functions that are affected under stress conditions 
			and provide users with a list of genes that have the highest representation across tentative orthologous sets.

Methodology
Dataset
Sequences derived from cDNA libraries generated from tissues subject to heat, dehydration, salt and cold stress from sixteen crop species were used to 
			construct the database. The sequences were downloaded from TIGR [], NCBI [] in 2003 and updated in June 2005.

Bioinformatics analysis
The sequences were assembled into contigs and singletons crop-wise using a parallelized version of cap3 [
			] on a paracel HPC. To construct tentative ortholog sets, each species-specific dataset consisting of contigs and singletons was Blast searched against 
			every other dataset using Blastn (standalone BLAST version 2.2.6). If a reciprocal best-hit (RBH) relationship between these sequences was revealed, then the 
			reciprocal best hits formed a tentative ortholog set. An additional constraint was that each set must comprise sequences from at least three crop species. 
			Scripts were written in Visual Basic to search and assemble tentative ortholog sets after the Blast searches. Sequences were searched for microsatellite
            markers using the tool SSRIT. [] Sequences in each dataset were translated and searched for protein
            motifs/patterns against the Prosite database of protein families and domains. All datasets were searched against the species specific plant repeats database 
            [] and hits with an e-value &lt; 1e-5 and an alignment of over 30% of length of query 
            sequence were annotated as repeats. Tentative functional descriptions for the remainder of the sequences were retrieved from each of the databases.
            These annotations were classified under the 28 functional categories described in the MIPS Functional catalogue Funcat. [] Scripts written in Java were used to carry out this classification. Multiple sequence alignments have been built using ClustalW (version
            1.83).

Database and GUI
The data is housed in a relational database on the MSSQL server 2000. The database GUI has been developed using Active Server Pages (ASP).

Utility
The database provides a collection of annotated tentative orthologous sequences from sixteen crop species () across four 
abiotic stress conditions (). The suite of user interfaces () allow the user to 
browse the database and query for: (a) annotated transcripts that are expressed across stress conditions, (b) transcripts with microsatellites that could be used as 
conserved functional markers, (c) conserved hypothetical genes that have orthologs in many other species but for which no function has been determined, and (d) ortholog 
sets with sequence alignment based on annotation, stress conditions or cluster size. The availability of this dataset is a useful resource for researchers studying the 
biology and genomics of stress response in plants and in the molecular evolution of genes involved in the stress response.

Future development
We routinely update and expand the database and analyses as additional sequence data becomes available; annotate sequence data with experimental information on 
candidate genes; and provide users with a reliability score for the ortholog sets constructed along with an analysis of orthologs developed using alternative 
algorithms.
