Background
Only certain microbial components - those open to surveillance by a host immune system - are likely to be potential subunit vaccines. Thus, subcellular location is, 
			for bacteria, a principal determinant of immunogenicity. There are five subcellular locations in Gram- bacteria and three locations in Gram+ bacteria. There have been 
			few attempts to generate prediction methods for all compartments, as most methods predict only certain locations. There are two basic types of prediction method. First, 
			the manual construction of rules derived from our current knowledge of the diverse factors determining subcellular location, and secondly, the application of data-driven 
			machine learning methods which automatically identify factors that determine subcellular location from features of proteins of known location.

The degrees of accuracy differ markedly between methods and compartments, reflecting either a paucity of data for a specific compartment or the lack of proper understanding 
			of what determines protein location. Subcellular location prediction methods are often classified according to two factors: the input data required and the process of constructing 
			prediction rules. Input data includes, the amino acid composition of the whole protein; sequence derived features of the protein (i.e. hydrophobic regions); the presence of certain 
			motifs; and the sequence itself, whether whole or in part. It is common to combine several types of input data. Expression patterns have been used, together with sequence motifs, since 
			expression levels and subcellular location are often correlated. Phylogenetic profiles can identify protein location through sequence similarity, based on the premise that the location 
			of close homologues can be assumed to be equal.

The output of prediction methods can be binary or multicategory. A binary predictor indicates if a protein is located in one category or not. A multi-category predictor will attempt to sort the 
query sequence into one of several possible locations. Binary predictors often have a high rate of false positive prediction. Multi-category prediction methods suffer reduced accuracy for certain 
location due to a scarcity of data or the complexity of the signal for that compartment or both. As always, the better the data the more accurate and reliable the resulting method. Signal complexity 
is a more complicated issue. A very complex signal requires abundant data to ensure that all signals are recognised with a high degree of confidence. A simple signal can also be problematic, in that 
many proteins may posses the sorting signal by chance alone. For example, SWISS-PROT contains twice as many non-perioxisomal proteins containing the PTS1 sorting signal than actual perioxisome proteins 
with the PTS1 signal.

Several predictors exist. PSORT [] is a knowledge-based, multi-category program for subcellular location prediction. It is often used as the gold 
standard for such prediction. PSORT consists of two different programs: PSORT I (predicting 17 subcellular compartments; trained on 295 proteins) and PSORT II (predicting 10 locations; trained on 1,080 yeast 
proteins), each using different algorithms. PSORT I uses “if-then” rules sequentially in a tree-like manner. PSORT II scores sequence-derived features for each localisation and then predicts using k 
nearestneighbours classification. PSORT II is the more accurate of the two methods. Using a test set of 940 plant proteins and 2,738 non-plant proteins, the accuracy of PSORT I and II was 69.8% and 83.2%. PSORT-B 
is specifically for the prediction of bacteria. [] NNPSL [] is a neural network method that predicts four 
locations - cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial and nuclear - using amino acid composition. 66.1% accuracy was reported for multicategory prediction. Mitochondrial localisation is predicted by MitoProt II 
[], which has certain similarities with bacterial prediction. When tested on 3,419 human mitochondrial proteins obtained from SWISS-PROT, an accuracy of 86.7% was reported.

In this paper, we describe the development of an array of binary predictors, one for each of the eight Gram+ and Gram- bacterial compartments. In contrast to other methods, these predictors use a single methodology based
on Bayesian Networks (BNs), which makes use of the same predictive architecture, the same sequence representation, and focuses on the same region of the sequence. We have also developed a predictor which discriminates between
soluble and non-soluble proteins. Together these methods form a cohesive, integrated, and standardised approach to subcellular location prediction. After validating this method using cross-validation and test sets, we compared its
predictivity to that of PSORTB.

Methodology
Dataset
An algorithm was used to mine the bacterial subset of SWISS-PROT release 40. [] Initially, bacterial status was confirmed using the OC line code of the SWISS-PROT 
			entry. Entries were split into Gram+ and Gram- at the superfamily level. The following were assigned as Gram+: actinobacteria; deinococcus; thermus; firmicutes; planctomycetes; and thermotogae, and the following assigned as 
			Gram-: chlamydia; verrucomicrobia; cyanobacteria; chloroflexi; fusobacteria; nitrospirae; proteobacteria; spirochaetes; chlorobi; and bacteroidete. The SWISS-PROT subcellular location descriptions (lines labelled CC) were 
			then searched to identify if the subcellular location was known. To remove proteins of uncertain location, only entries not labelled as ‘potential’, ‘probable’, ‘hypothetical’, ‘possibly’ or ‘by similarity’, were incorporated 
			into the final data-set. A non-redundant data-set of proteins was obtained using CLUSTALW. [] If two or more proteins were found to have sequence similarity higher than 90% 
			then all but one were removed from the data-set. The algorithm and subsequent CLUSTALW analysis produced a Gram+ data-set of were 272 extracellular proteins, 375 membranous proteins and 1500 cytoplasmic proteins, while the final 
			Gram+ data-set contained 185 extracellular, 159 outer membrane, 432 periplasmic, 273 inner membrane and 2480 cytoplasmic proteins.

Single protein class Gram- and Gram+ prediction
Individual methods were created for all eight bacterial locations, both Gram+ (cytoplasmic, membrane and extracellular) and Gram- (cytoplasmic, inner membrane, periplasm, outer membrane and extracellular). Three
sequence representations (actual residues, amino acid composition, and normalised amino acid composition) and six sub-sequence length were used (1-10, 1-20, 1-30, 1-40, 1-50 and the whole sequence). Each variation of the
method was used to train a single Näive-Bayes network for each of the eight locations, thus 24 BNs were constructed per location. For amino acid composition, BNs possessed 20 input nodes, each representing the raw number or
normalised percentage residue composition. The number of input nodes in the actual residue BNs varies dependent on the location. The Gram+ cytoplasmic, membranous and extracellular BNs had 1436, 1852 and 1627 input nodes
respectively. The Gram- cytoplasmic, inner membrane, periplasmic, outer membrane and extracellular BNs have 1368, 874, 1014, 2248 and 1848 input nodes respectively. The individual location networks are binary predictors and
therefore have a single output node that is either on or off for the predicted location.

A combined soluble class predictor, able to distinguish soluble (cytoplasmic and periplasmic) proteins from all other locations, was also created. This was based on considering the whole protein using pseudo-amino acid
composition. [] Pseudo-amino acid composition is used in preference to simple amino acid composition, as it attempts to model sequence-order effect. It is calculated using a
formula that assigns 40 scores to 40 input nodes for each sequence: 20 representing normal amino acid composition and 20 representing sequence-order effects. The output node can possess the values of soluble or non-soluble.

Testing of the networks was performed using their respective training sets under five-fold cross-validation. Each location-specific network was trained using known positive data for that location, while the negative training
set was all other sequences, except where a location is present in both Gram- and Gram+ bacteria i.e. cytoplasmic, membrane (in Gram+) and inner membrane (in Gram-), and extracellular. For these networks, sequences from the
equivalent location in the other Gram class were excluded. For the soluble predictor, the positive data-set was all cytoplasmic and periplasmic sequences obtained from SWISS-PROT and the negative data-set was the sequences
from all other locations. To assess the predictivity of the Bayesian approach, the same data-sets were submitted to PSORTB.

Results and Discussion
Results for the eight individual compartments are shown in ,  and . The most accurate 
prediction was achieved using amino acid composition for the first 50 residues. Both Gram+ and Gram- predictors achieved their
best accuracies under the same conditions. Prediction accuracy generally increases with increasing sub-sequence length from 10 residues to 50 residues, and then tails off slightly when the whole sequence is considered. For the
range of sub-sequence lengths the amino acid composition sequence representation consistently outperformed the other two representations. The sub-sequence size used affects the accuracy in a much more obvious manner. The
N-terminal compartment sorting signals are present in the sub-sequence lengths used in all networks and a method that best models the sorting signals will achieve the best accuracy.

Unsurprisingly the accuracies of all locations are highest when the first 50 residues are considered as this length will encompass the full lengths of the vast majority of signal sequences. The shorter sub-sequence lengths will only
consider the n region and possibly part of the h region. The variances in n-region charge and, therefore residues, does vary from signal peptide types and therefore can be used with some degree of accuracy to distinguish between
different signal peptide types. The h-region also varies in length and composition between different signal peptide types and therefore when both are considered a higher degree of accuracy is achieved.

The performance of the methods was compared to that of PSORTB (See ). The individual location methods outperform PSORTB with the exception of the Gram+ cytoplasmic proteins, in which the accuracies were
approximately equivalent, and the outer membrane proteins, in which PSORTB outperforms the individual method. This may be because outer membrane proteins have a notoriously variable amino acid composition due to
TM strands being exposed to both membrane and pore. The amino acid composition method therefore may not be suitable for the prediction of outer membrane proteins.

Conclusion
In the search for viable subunit vaccines, highly accurate methods for sub-cellular location prediction, such as the set of binary predictors we describe here, can aid reverse vaccinology directly. In particular, 
			the soluble predictor will significantly reduce the number of sequences that must be tested as vaccine targets. This is a breakthrough method since cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins are usually predicted as the residue 
			left after positive predictions for all other locations. Binary predictors discriminate between two classes; they are often more accurate than multi-outcome predictors, such as PSORTB, which is itself built from several binary
predictors. We judged the accuracy of our approach and that of PSORTB and found that out set of locationspecific methods, which is built on a single underlying methodology, compared favourably. However, when
several binary predictors are used to create a multioutcome prediction method, an efficient and effective way of combining the disparate outputs is still required. Nonetheless, our new BN approach is an important,
competitive advance in the development of subcellular location prediction methods. It should, it is own right, prove a powerful tool for candidate subunit vaccine selection.
