Background
The pivotal problem of gene identification in eukaryotes is distinguishing exons, from introns and intergenic regions. A number of coding measures like single and
polynucleotide bias differences, spectral differences etc which exist between these regions have been utilized for this purpose in various gene finding algorithms. But
simultaneous improvement of sensitivity and selectivity of these algorithms is still a challenge and so the hunt for new coding measures is to be continued.

The existing method of locating exons by genomic signal processing technique employing four binary indicator sequences, one for each nucleotide, depends on the
period three peaks observed in the power spectrum of the exon regions and which do not exist in non-coding regions. The method may be summarized as given
below. For a DNA string x[n] of N characters (with an alphabet A, G, C &amp; T) let us define four binary indicator sequences uA[n], uG[n], 
uC[n] &amp; uT[n]. [] Each indicator
sequence has a 1 if the corresponding base exists at the position n, otherwise a zero.

For example if, :as given in the  linked below

This coding measure has been utilized in the program ‘Genescan’ [] by 
		evaluating the N/3 component of the Fourier power spectrum of the binary indicator sequences through a sliding window and looking for the peaks, 
		whose strength (against the average strength of the power spectrum in the region) surpass a threshold which indicate the presence of exons. Also 
		an optimization technique [] has been devised for locating exons employing binary indicator 
		sequences. Another notable work is where an anti-notch filter [] is used to
        locate the exons by employing the four binary indicator sequences. A recent work reported [], 
        employs the Cumulative Categorical Periodogram (CCP) for the same end, but giving troughs at N/3 whereas the binary indicator sequences exhibit peaks.

Methodology
The authors propose a novel coding measure scheme by replacing the four binary indicator sequences by just one sequence which we call as ‘EIIP 
			indicator sequence’. The energy of delocalized electrons in amino acids and nucleotides has been calculated as the Electron-ion interaction 
			pseudopotential (EIIP). [] The EIIP values of amino acids have already been used in Resonant 
			Recognition Models (RRM) to substitute for the corresponding amino acids in protein sequences, whose Discrete Fourier Transforms are taken to extract 
			the information contents. [] The Fourier cross spectra of a group of related proteins reveal a 
			sharp peak at a frequency which is termed as the ‘characteristic frequency’ of that group of proteins as they are found to 
            represent a particular biological function and selectively interact with targets of the corresponding ‘characteristic frequency’ 
            (resonant recognition). [] This has been used to identify ‘hot spots’ in proteins and for peptide 
            design which are very useful in drug discovery. In the present work, the authors have made use of the EIIP values of the nucleotides rather than those 
            of aminoacids for locating exons. The EIIP values for the nucleotides are given in 

If we substitute the EIIP values for A, G, C &amp; T in a DNA string x[n], we get a numerical sequence which represents the distribution of 
			the free electrons' energies along the DNA sequence. This sequence is named as the ‘EIIP indicator sequence’, xe[n]. 
			For example, if x[n] = A A T G C A T C A, then using the values from , xe[n] = [0.1260 0.1260 
			0.1335 0.0806 0.1340 0.1260 0.1335 0.1340 0.1260].



When Se[k] is plotted against k, it reveals a peak at N/3 for a coding region and no such peak is observable for a
            noncoding region. As it is evident, the method has been simplified and computational overhead is reduced by 75% as now we have to 
            find the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of only one sequence instead of the FFT of four binary sequences used in the original method. 
            This may be used as a coding measure to detect probable coding regions in DNA sequences by examining the local signal to noise ratio 
            of the peak within a sliding window and by selecting an appropriate threshold.

Genescan [] takes an optimal window size of 351 and the same is adopted in the 
           present investigation. The authors have also experimented with both reduced and increased window sizes. When reduced window size is used, 
           peaking areas become ‘sharper’ which is advantageous for detection when exons are closer (separated by comparatively shorter introns) but 
           the subsequent increase in noise makes the discrimination poorer. On the other hand, increasing the window size makes the peaking areas 
           wider and thus resulting in missing of exons which are closer. Instead of a rectangular window adopted by Genescan, the authors have taken 
           Kaiser window which suppresses the noise more effectively as it has much smaller side lobes compared to rectangular window, and the binary 
           indicator sequences are replaced by a single EIIP indicator sequence.

Results and Discussion
The authors have checked the power spectrum of several exon segments of eukaryotic genes in a number of organisms using binary sequence 
			indicators and the proposed EIIP indicator sequence. Mainly, two data sets are used as bench mark for this purpose. One is the dataset prepared 
			by Burset and Guigó [,] and the other
            is HMR195 [] prepared by Sanja Rogic. In a good number of cases both methods performed 
            well, but there are instances were EIIP indicator sequence shows the peak at the right location (near N/3) where binary sequences fail, and a 
            few number of instances where the opposite is true, and of course there are a number of genes where both fail which proves that there exist many 
            exons without appreciable N/3 peak.  lists some of the exons which give period three peaks when EIIP 
            indicator sequence is employed and where the existing binary indicator sequence method fails.

The experiments using sliding windows show that in a number of cases the EIIP indicator sequence gives a better discrimination between coding and 
			non-coding regions.  and  show the power spectrum of a gene, 
			HUMELAFIN (Acc. No. D13156, homosapiens gene for elafin), using binary indicator sequences and using EIIP indicator, respectively. HUMELAFIN has two 
			exons, one from nucleotide positions 245 to 325, and the other from 1185 to1459. As it is evident from , 
			a ‘false exon’ (an intron region having greater peak than exon regions) appears when binary indicator sequences 
			are used and the peak of first exon (at 205) is also seen shifted from the actual region. On the contrary, the use of EIIP indicator sequence has 
			‘removed’ the ‘false’ exon and the peak of first exon is now inside the right region as seen from . However, the second exon peak is exhibited by both methods correctly.

 Summarizes the observations about nine genes where EIIP indicator sequence is found to be a better 
			discriminator than the binary indicator sequences. The last two columns in  are for comparing the 
			performances of the methods in terms of an exon-intron discrimination measure D given by,
			  
			  D=Lowest of theexonpeaks/Highest peakin noncoding regions

Higher the value of D better is the discrimination. If D is more than one, all exons are identified without ambiguity, D less than one indicates that 
           at least one exon is not having enough strength to be distinguished from noncoding areas. In all the examples cited, Method using EIIP indicator sequence 
           shows a better discrimination compared to the method using binary indicator sequences. And in two cases, (HUMCBRG and HUMELAFIN) binary indicator sequence 
           method even fails to identify all exons.

Conclusion
Ab initio gene finding still remains a challenging and exciting field as homology searches fail to identify around 30 to 50 
			% genes in newly sequenced genomes and none of the existing ab inito methods (methods using Hidden Markov Models are considered to be superior) 
			are found to have enough sensitivity and selectivity for a fail-proof prediction. The method presented in this paper which uses electron-ion interaction 
			pseudopotentials of nucleotides in genomic signal processing method of gene finding, improves the discrimination capability of the existing method and 
			obviously reduces the computational complexity.

The coding measure scheme using EIIP indicator sequence thus can be utilized for gene finding procedures using genomic signal processing assisted by 
            the grammar of genes and position weight matrices (PWMs) for splice sites. Also the possibility of applying the potential of EIIP sequence to other exon 
            prediction techniques such as Autoregressive modeling (AR), Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF) and Time Domain Periodogram (TDP) etc can also be 
            explored. Thus, we hope, the fact that a physico-chemical property like EIIP has a role in the formation of protein coding regions of genomes will trigger 
            a lot of research in related areas.
