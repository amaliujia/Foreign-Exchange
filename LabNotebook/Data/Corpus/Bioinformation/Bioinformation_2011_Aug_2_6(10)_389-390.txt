Background
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D gel) remains an important tool in
proteomics for protein separation and quantification. The discovery of
interesting proteins relies on the analysis of 2D gel images 
[]. However, there
are large amount of variations contained in the gel images, which should be
appropriately accounted for using statistical methods. Unlike analysis of
microarray images, there are limited published research and freely available
software packages on statistical differential analysis of 2D gel images. The
main challenges are the discrimination between actual protein spots and noise,
the quantification of protein spots thereafter, and spot matching for individual
comparison [,
]. Although there are commercial software packages for 2D
gel image analysis (e.g. PDQuest, Dymension), considerable human
intervention is needed for spot identification and matching. Moreover, the
comparison of the quantitative features is either based on simple t-test or relies
on external statistical tools for analysis. We developed open-source software
with graphical user interface, RegStatGel, which is fast, fully automated and
robust, with an emphasis on identifying differentially expressed proteins
instead of striving for accurate quantification. Moreover, the RegStatGel
software incorporates more advanced statistical tools for identifying
differentially expressed proteins. It implements a novel analysis procedure as
described elsewhere [].

Methodology
The software, RegStatGel, bypasses the spot-matching bottleneck by detecting
spots using the mean gel image and comparing protein features within
watershed boundaries. RegStatGel uses the watershed algorithm to
automatically define the region surrounding a spot. The analysis procedure is
described in detail []. 
It contains fully automated as well as interactive
analysis procedures. Snapshots of the main interface of RegStatGel and of the
sub-items of selected menus are shown in . RegStatGel is
implemented in Matlab 7.01. There are three modes of operation within
RegStatGel: Fully automated mode: the user loads the images and then clicks
on the menu to choose the fully automated analysis under the ‘Gel Analysis’
menu. Interactive automated mode: the user will be automatically prompted to
choose the parameters for some procedures or skipping some procedures for
exploratory purpose. The interactive mode can be accessed via the submenu
under ‘Gel Analysis’. Exploratory mode: the user can explore the protein
regions sequentially by clicking the ‘next’ or ‘previous’ buttons. The user can
also use the slider to choose the size of the image section that needs closer
inspection. The fully automated analysis procedure implemented in RegStatGel
contains the following key steps: (1) smoothing and rescaling of gel images; (2)
construction of the master watershed map using the mean image; (3)
segmentation of watershed regions; (4) quantification of watershed regions; (5)
separation of protein regions into independent sets of correlated proteins; (6)
statistical analysis using one way or two-way ANOVA or MANOVA; (7)
selection of interesting proteins regions while controlling the false discovery
rate at selected level.

Software Input
RegStatGel can load gel images with various formats. At first run, the user will
be asked some information about the experimental design such as how many
experimental groups and how many images within each group. The software
then loads images by groups. The user can load files saved during a previous
run. The software features default settings for parameters. The user can easily
edit the default parameters in self-evident menus.

Software Output
During the automated mode, the software will display the status of each key
step. At the end of the automated analysis, RegStatGel shows an image with
differentially expressed proteins highlighted. The software provides menus to
save results from different steps, such as the quantification of the proteins and
the list of proteins detected. Under the exploration mode, the user can choose to
investigate the detected spots individually by looking at their 3D shape.

Caveat &amp; Future Development
It should be noted that RegStatGel focuses on post-alignment analysis so there
is no image alignment function. The software is not sensitive to misalignment
as long as it is slight. The next version will have additional options for
statistical analysis.
