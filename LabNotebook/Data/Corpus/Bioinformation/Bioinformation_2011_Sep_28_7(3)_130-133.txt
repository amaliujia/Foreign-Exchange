Background:
Tuberculosis caused 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative
people and 0.38 million deaths among HIV-positive people in
2009. An estimated 250,000 TB patients were notified in 2009, to
have multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) []. M. tuberculosis
makes a lethal combination with HIV, both catalyzing the
progression of AIDS and TB respectively [,
]. There is hence
an urgent need for novel therapeutics for combating these
diseases. The genome of M. tuberculosis codes for about 4000
proteins [] and identification of an ideal target is the most
critical task in the process of drug discovery. Bacterial P450s
participate in the degradation of xenobiotics, reduction of nitric
oxide and antibiotic synthesis. On the other hand, human P450s
are intimately associated with drug metabolism and steroid
synthesis [,
]. 
The genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
encodes 20 different cytochrome P450 enzymes []. Among
them, CYP121 has been demonstrated to be essential for the
viability of M. tuberculosis 
[]. Besides, there is no equivalent
enzyme in humans. We therefore hypothesized that CYP121
could be a potential drug target for M. tuberculosis. Azole drugs
have been demonstrated to bind with high affinity to
cytochrome P450eryF (CYP107A1) of Saccharopolyspora erythraea
[] and have been used effectively for the treatment of fungal
infections []. A few studies have examined the action of azole
drugs on P450s in M. tuberculosis, particularly on CYP121 
[,
] 
and CYP130 [] and found them to bind to these proteins,
although with a weaker affinity. We therefore made an attempt
to identify stronger inhibitors of CYP121 of M. tuberculosis using
molecular docking with structural analogs of the available azole
drugs.

Methodology
Preparation of small molecules library
Econazole and clotrimazole [,
] , ketoconazole, miconazole
[] and fluconazole 
[] have been reported to have a possible
effect on P450s of M. tuberculosis. Tioconazole 
[] and the
above mentioned drugs have already been demonstrated to
have anti-fungal activity. Structural analogs of these six azole
molecules were collected from PubChem [] at 95% structural
similarity. All these molecules were screened in silico for their
inhibitory activity against CYP121.

Molecular Docking:
Ten different structures are available in PDB for CYP121 of M.
tuberculosis (2IJ5, 2IJ7, 3G5F, 3G5H, 3CY1, 3CY0, 3CXV, 3CXX,
3CXZ, 3CXY). We selected 2IJ7 as the PDB file for docking since
it has been crystallized in the presence of fluconazole and heme.
The atomic coordinates of Cytochrome P450 121 (2IJ7) of M.
tuberculosis was downloaded from PDB. All ligands and water
molecules except those that were part of the active site in the
target were removed and hydrogen atoms were added to the
protein. CHARMm force field was then applied to the target.
The substrate binding site of CYP121 was selected for docking
using CDOCKER (Discovery Studio, 2.0) [].

Scoring Docked Molecules:
In order to enhance the accuracy of the prediction, the docked
poses were ranked using two different scoring functions
namely PLP1 and Ligscore2, since these two methods of scoring
are reported to be better than several other methods 
[].
Molecules that scored best by both methods were identified as
potential leads for tuberculosis drug discovery.

Results and Discussion:
The density of cytochrome in M. tuberculosis is 200 fold more
than in humans []. The preponderance of P450 in M.
tuberculosis suggests that these enzymes could have important
cellular functions in the pathogen. Since the inhibitory role of
azole drugs on cytochrome P450s of other organisms has been
widely demonstrated, we screened six azole drugs and their
respective structural analogs for their effect on CYP121 of M.
tuberculosis using in silico methods. The six azole molecules
(econazole, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, tioconazole
and flucanozole) were first docked on to CYP121 and scored
using PLP1 as well as LigScore2. Ketoconazole was found to
have the best score by both methods. Therefore, ketoconazole
was chosen as the control molecule for our analysis. Three
hundred and fifty seven molecules were collected from
PubChem as structural analogs for the above six azole
molecules at 95% similarity. Each of these analogs were docked
onto CYP121 and scored using PLP1 and LigScore 2. Of the 357
molecules, 60 had a better docking score than ketoconazole
when PLP1 scoring function was applied, and 115 molecules
scored better than ketoconazole using LigScore2.

Fifty three molecules were consistently picked up by both
methods as better molecules than ketoconazole, as they possibly
have better binding affinity to CYP121 than ketoconazole. Of
the 53 molecules, 43 were found to be structural analogs of
ketoconazole and 6, 2 and 2 were analogs of Econazole,
Miconazole and Tioconazole, respectively. None of the analogs
of Clotrimazole and Fluconazole scored better than
ketoconazole. The top ten molecules ranked by PLP1 and
LigScore2 with corresponding energy scores are listed in 
 
(see supplementary material). We have used Chemical ID
(CID) given in PubChem for identification of the molecules in
our analysis. Four of the 53 molecules (CID: 21443149, 21499732,
12854724 and 20406023) were found to be among the top ten
ranking molecules identified by both PLP1 and LigScore2. One
molecule (CID: 20519316) which scored as third best by the
PLP1 scoring function was placed in the 12th rank by LigScore2.
The short-listed five molecules were subjected to energy
minimization using steepest descent method. A significant
difference in the binding energy was observed after energy
minimization was carried out.  shows a representative
structure after energy minimization. Seward et al. (2006)
reported a set of ten amino acids to be part of the active site of
CYP121 []. 
It was found that all the ten amino acids
comprising the active site of CYP 121 were present in the
docked poses of two molecules (21499732 and 20406023) and
nine residues were present in the docked pose of the molecule
(12854724), showing the effective binding of these molecules to
the active site of CYP121. We therefore propose that these five
molecules could serve as potential leads for novel drug
discovery for tuberculosis.

Conclusion
Molecular docking studies have helped in the identification of
potential small molecules for drug discovery for various
diseases []. 
Recently Izumizono et al. (2011) demonstrated the
potential of docking in short-listing potential candidates and
subsequently confirmed its efficiency by in vitro testing on M.
tuberculosis []. We employed the same principle of molecular
docking and followed it up with the use of stringent scoring
functions to enhance the accuracy of our results. The set of
molecules identified by us in this study are very likely to serve
as potential leads in the search for new drugs against
tuberculosis.
