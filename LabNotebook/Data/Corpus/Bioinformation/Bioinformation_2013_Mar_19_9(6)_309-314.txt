Background
In 1989 it was exposed for the first time that Hepatitis C virus is
the main causative agent of hepatitis C []. It is a positivestranded
RNA virus and classified as a flavivirus []. About 200
million individuals are estimated worldwide to be infected with
hepatitis C virus [,
]. In Pakistan HCV infection was found in
about 10 million people []. In 50% to 80% of people chronic
hepatitis was found due to HCV infection []. Eventually some
of these patients lead to severe liver disease such as cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma [].

A polyprotein precursor encoded by HCV RNA genome
containing structural proteins capsid [C], membrane [prM],
envelope [E] and nonstructural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b,
NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5) []. NS3 protease when activated by
NS4A causes the cleavage of polyprotein producing the nonstructural
proteins 4A, 4B, 5A, and 5B and is therefore very
supportive for the replication of virus [,
]. NS3 protease
required the vital 14-monomer hydrophobic peptide NS4A for
its activation []. The active site configuration of NS3 protease
comprises the residues His-57, Asp-81, and Ser-139 []. NS3
protease consists of an N-terminal protease domain and a Cterminal
helicase domain []. The protease and helicase
domains of NS3 have their individual functions i.e. NS3/4A
protease causes polyprotein processing and helicase activity is
RNA replication. In addition it has also been found that
protease increases the helicase activity and the protease activity
is enhanced by the helicase [,
].

NS3/4A protease is an important emerging target for the cure
of hepatitis C []. There are many inhibitors of HCV NS3/4A
protease that are passing through the clinical improvement
indicating momentous reduction in the viral load of patients
[]. Currently, the development of the direct-acting antiviral
agents (DDAs) in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin
have established substantial improvement in the viral treatment
rates with reduced treatment period in patients infected with
hepatitis C genotype 1 []. In 1996 the crystal structures of the
NS3 protease of Hepatitis C Virus were published for the first
time with and without the cofactor NS4A []. Currently
Protein Data Bank (PDB) is presented with about 50 structures
of NS3/4A protease of HCV both in complexed and free forms
[,
]. This data provide a valuable source for the
development of novel and potential drug against
HCV.Molecular docking is a computational method that can be
used to explain the interactions of ligands with the receptor.
There are a number of docking methods. Among them one is
MOE-Dock method []. We applied this method to study the
best binding interactions of the retrieved ligands with the
NS3/4A protease of HCV. The intend of this study was to
predict potent ligands that could inhibit NS3 polyprotein
processing, replication of hepatitis C virus and to better
understand the interactions between the protein binding sites
and inhibitor.

Methodology
In this study an effort was made to carry out the docking of the
ligands into HCV NS3/4A protein by means of MOE
(Molecular Operating Environment) software package. LigPlot
implemented in MOE was used to imagine the interactions
between HCV NS3/4A protease and Ligands.

Retrieval of ligands:
The inhibitors for NS3/4A Protease included in our study and
their IC50 values were all collected from the previous literature
[]. 
The structures of these inhibitors were constructed using
MOE-Builder tool. The 2D structures of these retrieved ligands
are shown in (). The related 3D structures were also
obtained and the energies of the identified molecules were
minimized using the default parameters of MOE energy
minimization algorithm [gradient: 0.05, Force Field: MMFF94X].

Preparation of Receptor Protein:
The protein molecule included in our study, HCV NS3/4A
protease was obtained from Protein Data Bank [PDB Code
4a92]. Water molecules were removed and the 3D protonation
of the protein molecule was carried out. The energy of the
retrieved protein molecule was minimized using the default
parameters of MOE energy minimization algorithm [gradient:
0.05, Force Field: MMFF94X].

Molecular Docking:
The default parmeters of MOE-Dock program were used for the
molecular docking of the ligands. To find the correct
conformations of the ligands and to obtain minimum energy
structures, ligands were allowed to be flexible. At the end of
docking, the best conformations of the ligands were analyzed
for their binding interactions.

Results &amp; Discussion
Validation of the docking procedure:
In order to assess the accuracy of MOE-Dock parogram the cocrystallized
ligand was removed from the active site and
redocked within the inhibitor binding cavity of NS3/4A
protease. In this study, RMSD value () was found as
1.8299 Å, showing that our docking method is valid for the
studied inhibitors [] and MOE-Dock method, therefore, is
reliable for docking of these inhibitors.

Docking Analysis:
Correlation between docking score and IC50 value:
From the docking studies it was observed that the most active
compound 05 (IC50; &lt;0.2 nM) was ranked as second 

(see supplementary material) indicating good agreement
between the docking and experimental results. The results
show that the molecular docking approach is reliable and
produces a good correlation coefficient (r² = 0.519) between pdocking
score and IC50 values of the ligands after the removal
of two compounds (04 &amp; 11) as shown in ().

Binding interactions of ligands and Protein:
The most active compound 05 is clear from () that this
compound was bound deeply into the binding cavity of NS3
protease making interactions with the residues Gly137, Ser139,
His57, Ala157 and Gln 526. Gly137 interacts with the oxygen
double bonded to S on one side while Ser139 and His57 were
found in interaction with the oxygen double bonded to the
same S on the other side. The interaction of Ala157 was found
with the oxygen of amide functional group bonded to
pyrrolidine ring. Gln 526 was in a polar interaction with the N
of urea linker of the ligand.

Compounds 1, 2, 6 and 9 are the second most active compounds
(IC50; 0.4 nM) among the compounds included in this study.
Among these four compounds, compound 02 and 09 showed
four interactions while each one of the other two compounds
(01, 06) was found making three interactions with the residues
of the binding cavity of protein.

There were some four prominent interactions observed between
compound 02 and the binding site residues Cys159, His528,
Asp527 and Asp168 (). Cys159 showed interaction
with the N and His528 with the Oxygen of amide functional
group bonded to S. A hydrogen bonding interaction was found
between the Asp168 and the hydroxyl group of benzoxaborole
ring. The fourth interaction was found between Asp527 and the
N of urea linker of benzoxaborole moiety.

The structural difference between compound 02 and most
active compound 05 that may lead to the difference in activity
and protein ligand interactions is the presence of Fluorine on
the benzoxaborole ring of compound 05. It may be suggested
that the polarity of compound 05 increases due to the presence
of Fluorine on the benzoxaborole ring which enhances its
activity and interactions with the protein.

The equipotent compounds 01 and 09 showed almost similar
interactions with the protein. Compound 01 showed ()
three interactions with the residues His57, Lys136 and Ala157.
His57 and Lys136 were found in arene-cation and arenehydrogen
interactions respectively with the benzene ring of
indoline group. Ala157 made polar interaction with the double
bonded oxygen of carboxylate group between indoline rings
and pyrrolidine.

Some similar interactions were also found in compound 09-
protein docked complex (). Compound 09 has an
isoquinoline ring instead of indoline as were in compounds 01,
02 and 05. Here His57 and Lys136 showed the same arenecation
and arene-hydrogen interactions respectively with the
benzene ring of isoquinoline moity as were shown with
indoline in compound 01. Ala157 was found making interaction
with the hydroxyl group of benzoxaborole ring. Benzoxaborole
ring was absent in compound 01 where Ala157 made polar
interaction with the double bonded oxygen of carboxylate
group between indoline rings and pyrrolidine. In addition to
these three interactions His528 was involved in an arenehydrogen
interaction with the benzoxaborole ring of the
compound.

The isoquinoline moiety of compound 09 and indoline group of
compound 01 showed similar behavior regarding interactions.
However the substitution of the benzoxaborole ring in
compound 09 improved number of interactions with the target
protein. The main structural difference found between
compound 09 and the most active compound 05 was Fluorine
group bonded to benzoxaborole ring in compound 05 that
might be the cause of slightly high activity of compound 05.

Compound 06 is also equipotent to compound 01, 02 and 09
(IC50; 0.4nM) although it came up with low ranking on docking
score. Here three interactions were found between the ligand
and target protein (). Ser139 and His57 showed
interactions with the oxygen double bonded to S. The third
interaction was shown by Ala157 with the oxygen of amide
functional group bonded to pyrrolidine ring.

The structural difference found between compound 06 and
most active compound 05 was the methyl group substituted on
benzoxaborole ring in compound 06. The indoline and
benzoxaborole rings showed no interaction in this conformation
and may be a cause of low ranking of this compound on
docking score. This may suggest that further optimization
especially in this compound should be possible.

The third most active compound 08 (IC50; 0.6 nM) was found
making three interactions with the residues His57, Ala157 and
His528 (). His57 showed arene-cation interaction with
the benzoxaborole ring of the ligand. Ala157 made hydrogen
bond with the oxygen of urea linker of the side chain of
compound. The third interaction was made by His528 with the
oxygen of amide functional group bonded to pyrrolidine ring.
The presence of isoquinoline ring and lack of Fluorine group on
the benzoxaborole ring in compound 08 might be a cause of
somewhat low enzymatic potency of compound 08 as
compared to compound 05.

Compound 07 is the fourth active compound (IC50; 1.0 nm) and
here six important interactions were observed with the residues
Asp168, Gly137, Ser139, His57 and Cys159 (). A
hydrogen bonding interaction was found between the Asp168
and the hydroxyl group of benzoxaborole ring of the ligand.
Gly137 was found making interaction with oxygen double
bonded to S on one side while Ser139 and His57 made
interactions with the oxygen double bonded to S on the other
side. Cys159 interestingly showed two interactions, one with
the oxygen of carboxylate group and second with the C of
indoline ring.

The structural difference between compound 07 and the most
active compound 05 is the amide linker with benzoxaborole
ring in compound 07 which is urea linker in compound 05. This
amide linker in compound 07 may provide enzymatic potency
slightly inferior to compound 05.

Conclusion
The docking analysis resulted in the detection of important
ligand interactions with respect to binding site of targeted
protein. As a result of this study we concluded that the
inhibitors computationally studied here have shown good
relationship among IC50 values, docking score and binding
interactions. The compounds 01, 05, 06, 07, 08 and 09 distinctly
showed interactions with one or two reported active site
residues [] of the target protein NS3/4A protease. So these
compounds may be potent drug candidates and their potency
may be increased against HCV NS3/4A protease with relatively
simple structural changes.
