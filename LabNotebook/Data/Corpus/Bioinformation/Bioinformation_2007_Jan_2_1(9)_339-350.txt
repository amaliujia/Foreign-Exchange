Background
Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is a major disease infecting
two billion people, or approximately one-third of the world's population. These numbers are rising also in the
developed countries due to the compromised immune systems, typically as a result of immunosuppressive drugs.
This population is at particular risk of infection and active tuberculosis disease.

In M. tuberculosis, a major secreted protein complex, 
antigen 85, constitutes three proteins antigen 85A, 85B and
85C []
that are responsible for the synthesis of cell
envelope. These enzymes catalyze the transfer of mycolyl
residue from one molecule of α, α' trehalosemonomycolate
(TMM) to another TMM leading to the formation of α, α'
trehalosedimycolate (TDM) [] and are hence termed
mycolyltransferases. These enzymes have the ability to
bind the human fibronectin [] through which the
bacterium gets attached to host cells. Due to their
immunodominant and secretory nature, the components of
Ag85 complex represent promising protective antigen
candidates. Also, the cell envelope of M. tuberculosis has
been one of the targets of antimycobacterial agents. Drugs
such as isoniazid, ethionamide, isoxyl, thiolactomycin, and
triclosan and ethambutol, target the synthesis of mycolic
acids in M. tuberculosis. In addition, pyrazinamide was
shown to inhibit fatty acid synthase type I that in turn,
provides precursors for fatty acid elongation to long-chain
mycolic acids by fatty acid synthase II. [] Mycolic acid
biosynthesis is known to be essential for mycobacterium
growth, in particular trehalose mycolates aid in virulence of
the organism and the structure of mycolates has been found to be important for initial replication and persistence in
vivo. [] A mutated M. tuberculosis strain lacking the
functional Ag85C gene showed a 40% decrease in the
amount of cell wall linked mycolic acids indicating its role
in cell wall synthesis. [] The importance of
mycolyltransferases in pathogenesis and cell wall formation
makes them an attractive target for drug design studies. A
series of 6,6'-bis(sulfonamido), N,N'-dialkylamino and
related derivatives of 6,6'-dideoxytrehalose were designed
and synthesized to inhibit the Ag85 complex. []

The three dimensional crystal structures of Ag85A (PDB
ID: 1SFR) [] Ag85B (PDB IDs: 1F0N, 1F0P) [] and
Ag85C (PDB IDs: 1DQZ, 1DQY, 1VA5) [] were
determined for both native and substrate bound forms. The
protein structure corresponds to a α/β hydrolase fold and
the catalytic triad responsible for the mycolyltransferase
activity comprise the amino acid residues Ser624, Glu728
and His760 (numbering according to the PDB_ID: 1DQZ,
B chain). This active site is typical of a serine protease
family. Structural comparison of mycolyltransferases
revealed that their backbone superimposes with an overall
RMSD (root mean square deviation) of 0.577 Å. The
catalytic residues are highly superimposed in these
structures indicating that the structure and function of these
isozymes are highly similar. Minor deviations are observed
in the loop region connecting strand 4 and helix 3,
comprising the sequence motif, 85Q-S-N-G-Q-N90 in
Ag85C. This region is away from the substrate binding site
and therefore will not affect substrate/inhibitor binding to
the enzyme. A putative picture of the catalytic mechanism
of the mycolyl transfer reaction been proposed by Ronning
et al., 2000. [] In the first step, catalytic serine attacks the carboxyl carbon of TMM molecule to give a
mycolylenzyme intermediate and a free trehalose. In the
next step, the 6'-OH group of the second TMM molecule
attacks the carboxylate carbon of the acyl-enzyme
intermediate to yield TDM. Both acylation and deacylation
of the enzyme, proceed via a high-energy tetrahedral
transition state. It is known that substituted tetrahedral
phosphorus (V) species like phosphonates,
phosphonamidates and phosphinates represent good
tetrahedral transition state analogous of both amide and
ester bond cleavage or formation. Incorporation of the
phosphorus based transition state mimetics into the
substrate or product analogs generally leads to useful
enzyme inhibitors. Gobec et al., 2004 [] synthesized a
series of phosphonate inhibitors and reported the inhibition
of Ag85C mycolyltransferase activity in the presence of
inhibitors. Rose et al., 2002 [] studied the
antimycobacterial activity of trehalose analogs against M.
tuberculosis H37Ra and clinical isolates of M. avium.

Several groups have earlier carried out a comparative
evaluation of the docking methods and scoring functions.
[,,] 
Results from Verdonk et al., 2003 []
indicated that for “drug like” and “fragment like” ligands,
the docking accuracies obtained from GoldScore and
ChemScore are similar, while for larger ligands, GoldScore
gave better results. Docking involves the identification of
ligand conformation and orientation in the protein binding
pockets. The scoring functions are helpful to predict the
biological activity of the ligand. The aim of the present
work is to study the docking of phosphonate and trehalose
analog inhibitors into the active site of Ag85C using the
GOLD software. [,] In this work, we compared the
scoring functions, GoldScore and ChemScore that are
available in the Gold docking software. The three
mycolyltransferases have highly similar structure, we have
therefore chosen the three dimensional structure of Ag85C
(PDB ID: 1DQZ) as a representative structure for docking
studies. Also, the inhibition of Ag85C by the phosphonate
inhibitors by Gobec et al., 2004 has been studied and the
experimental IC50 values are reported. Since this enzyme
functions as a serine protease, these docking studies will
help characterize the inhibitor binding site. The information
about the inhibitor binding site can be used to design
Ag85C specific inhibitors that would not interfere with the
other physiologically important ubiquitous serine proteases
in humans.

Methodology
Energy minimization of protein
The crystal structure coordinates of the Ag85C (PDB_ID:
1DQZ) were obtained from the protein data bank
(
http://www.rcsb.org/) and the B chain was selected for
docking studies. All hydrogen atoms were added to the
protein, including those necessary to define the correct
ionization and tautomeric states of amino acid residues
such as Asp, Ser, Glu, Arg and His using Cache software (
www.cachesoftware.com/cache). A two stage protocol was
set up for the energy minimization of protein using
Hyperchem7 (Hypercube Inc.), molecular modeling
software. In the first stage, all hydrogen atoms in the
protein were allowed to optimize. The hydrogen locations
are not specified by the X-ray structure but these are
necessary to improve the hydrogen bond geometries. In the
second stage, all protein atoms were allowed to relax.
Minimization in both stages was performed using 100 steps
of steepest descent and 2000 steps of conjugate gradient
algorithm.

Binding site analysis
The binding site identification of mycolyltransferases,
Ag85A, Ag85B and Ag85C was carried out using the
Binding Site Analysis module available in Insight II
(Acclerys, USA). The default parameters for grid size 1.00
Å and site open size 7.00 Å were used in binding site
calculation.

Selection of docking molecules
A set of 17 phosphonate inhibitors is taken from the
reported literature [] for the docking studies. A list of
these molecules is provided in  and a schematic
representation of the molecules with least IC50 values is
provided in . Similarly, a set of 9 trehalose
analogs is taken from the reported literature [] for docking
studies. A list of these molecules is provided in 
and a schematic representation of the molecules with least
MIC values are provided in . We have adapted
the numbering of these inhibitors as represented in the
original papers. [,]

Molecular Modeling
The phosphonate and trehalose analog inhibitors were built
using the Hyperchem7. The structures were energy
minimized using the steepest descent algorithm with a
convergence gradient value of 0.001 kcal/mol. Further, the
geometry optimization was carried out for each compound
using the MOPAC 6 package and the semi empirical AM1
Hamiltonian.

Docking
Docking was carried out using GOLD (Genetic
optimization for Ligand Docking) software, that uses the
Genetic algorithm (GA). This method allows a partial
flexibility of protein and full flexibility of ligand. All water
molecules and hetero atoms were removed from the protein
to evaluate the two scoring functions in GOLD software.
For each of the 25 independent GA runs, a maximum
number of 100000 GA operations were performed on a set
of five groups with a population size of 100 individuals.
Operator weights for crossover, mutation, and migration
were set to 95, 95, and 10, respectively. Default cutoff
values of 2.5 Å (dH-X) for hydrogen bonds and 4.0 Å for
van der Waals distance were employed. When the top three
solutions attained RMSD values within 1.5 Å, GA docking was terminated. The RMSD values for the docking
calculations are based on the RMSD matrix of the ranked
solutions. We observed that the best ranked solutions were
always among the first 10 GA runs, and the conformation
of molecules based on the best fitness score was further
analyzed. All the 17 phosphonate and 9 trehalose analog
inhibitors were analyzed using docking studies and the
molecules with least IC50 and MIC values respectively in
each group are described in detail in the results and
discussion section.

The two scoring functions available in the GOLD software
to measure the affinity of ligand for protein binding site
are

GoldScore fitness function
GoldScore performs a force field based scoring function
and is made up of four components: 1. Protein-ligand
hydrogen bond energy (external H-bond); 2. Protein-ligand
van der Waals energy (external vdw); 3. Ligand internal
van der Waals energy (internal vdw); 4. Ligand
intramolecular hydrogen bond energy (internal- H- bond).
The external vdw score is multiplied by a factor of 1.375
when the total fitness score is computed. This is an
empirical correction to encourage protein-ligand
hydrophobic contact. The fitness function has been
optimized for the prediction of ligand binding positions.
GoldScore = S(hb_ext) + S(vdw_ext) + S(hb_int) +
S(vdw_int)

Where S(hb_ext) is the protein-ligand hydrogen bond
score, S(vdw_ext) is the protein-ligand van der Waals
score, S(hb_int) is the score from intramolecular hydrogen
bond in the ligand and S(vdw_int) is the score from
intramolecular strain in the ligand.

ChemScore fitness function
ChemScore is an empirical scoring function to estimate the
free energy of ligand binding to protein. It uses simple contact terms to estimate lipophilic and metal-ligand
binding contributions, including hydrogen bonding
interactions. It does not differentiate between different
types of hydrogen bonds, depending on the nature and
geometry of the interaction. It adds a clash penalty and
internal torsion terms, which influence against close
contacts in docking and poor internal conformations.
Covalent and constraint scores may also be included.

ChemScore estimates the total free energy change that
occurs on ligand binding to protein as per the equation
given below

ΔG binding = ΔG o+ ΔG hbond + ΔG metal + ΔG lipo + ΔG rot
.... (1)

Each component of this equation is the product of a term
dependent on the magnitude of a particular physical
contribution to free energy (e.g. hydrogen bonding) and a
scale factor determined by regression.

ChemScore = ΔG binding + Pclash +Cinternal Pinternal + (Ccovalent
Pcovalent + Pconstraint) .... (2)

Results and Discussion
Binding site analysis of mycolyltransferases, Ag85A,
Ag85B and Ag85C identified that, their binding pockets are
identical and the largest binding pocket overlaps with the
trehalose binding position in the PDB ID: 1F0P (data not
shown). This further increased our confidence that the
structures of mycolyltransferases are highly similar and we have therefore taken Ag85C as the representative structure
for docking studies. The docking of phosphonate and
trehalose analog inhibitors into the active site of
mycolyltransferase, Ag85C was carried out using the
GOLD software and the docking evaluations were made on
the basis of two fitness functions, GoldScore and
ChemScore. For both the scoring functions, the docking
conformation generated with best fitness has been analyzed
using two different criteria. These are 1) ligand binding
position, and 2) fitness function score comparison.

atoms are 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, and 12 as indicated in .

Criteria-2
Fitness function score comparison. The
phosphonate inhibitors were docked into the active site of
Ag85C and evaluated based on both the fitness scoring
functions- GoldScore and ChemScore available in the
GOLD software. We observed that the GoldScore
correlated well with the reported IC50 values as shown in
. There are no compounds with high GoldScore
and low activity (high IC50 values). The exceptions are
molecules 3b and 3c that bind the Ag85C with a GoldScore
of 50.30 and 51.18, while the IC50 values are 3.5 μM and
1.06 μM, respectively. We hypothesize that the low
GoldScore for these molecules is due to the presence of OH
substitution alone on the phosphate head group. When the
docked molecules were evaluated based on the ChemScore,
there is no such correlation with the IC50 values, see
. These results indicate that the GoldScore is a
better parameter to assess the binding of phosphonate
inhibitors to Ag85C and there is an overall 70-80 %
correlation between the GoldScore and IC50 values.

FFor the trehalose analog inhibitors, Rose et al., 2002 []
have reported the MIC values in order to estimate their
activity as antimycobacterial agents, therefore, we have not
correlated them with the GoldScore and ChemScore.

In the crystal structure of Ag85B complexed with trehalose
substrate (PDB ID: 1F0P), it has been shown that Ser124
(equivalent of Ser624 in Ag85C, B chain) forms a
hydrogen bonding interaction with atom O6 of trehalose.
[] From our docking studies, we have shown that this
serine forms a hydrogen bonding interactions with
phosphonate and trehalose analog inhibitors (see  and ). Further, we also identified additional amino acid
residues, Arg541 and Trp762 important for inhibitor
recognition mediated via non-bonding interactions.
Sequence analysis identified that Arg541, Ser624 and
Trp762 are highly conserved in mycolyltransferases [] of
M. tuberculosis. Current docking studies using the
GoldScore fitness function reported a hydrophobic tunnel
to accommodate the hydrocarbon alkyl chain of
phosphonate and R1 alkyl chain of trehalose analog
inhibitors. This hydrophobic tunnel comprises the residues
Leu540, Phe576, Phe650, Trp658, Leu661, Ile662, Leu623,
Met625, Ala665 and Leu727. In the reported crystal
structures of Ag85B and Ag85C [,], the authors have
described a hydrophobic tunnel comprising these residues
to accommodate α- alkyl chain of mycolic acids. It was
also proposed that β- alkyl chain of mycolic acids would fit
the trough on the surface of the protein. Docking of
trehalose analog inhibitors identified the R2 alkyl chain to
bind the region comprising amino acid residues Tyr510,
Gln525, Ala542, Gln543, Asp545, Gly548, Asp550, Ile551,
Asn552, Pro554 that are located on the surface of the
protein. These results indicate that the predicted
nonbonding interactions and hydrophobic region to
accommodate the alkyl chains are similar to the
experimental data obtained from crystal structures.

Conclusion
A detailed docking analysis of phosphonate and trehalose
analog inhibitors into the active site of Ag85C has been
studied in the present work, to identify the inhibitor binding
position and affinity to Ag85C using the Gold software. We
report that the GoldScore fitness function is marginally
better than the ChemScore fitness function, to understand
the binding conformation. Also, GoldScore provides a
qualitative agreement with the reported IC50 values of
phosphonate inhibitors.
