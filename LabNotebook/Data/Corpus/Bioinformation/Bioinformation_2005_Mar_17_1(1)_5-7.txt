Background
Antibiotics have become major means of treating bacterial infections since their 
      discovery sixty years ago. Global antibiotic market is now estimated at more than 
      US$ 25 billion per year.[]
      However, the increased use of antibiotics forced the evolution of drug resistant bacterial 
      strains at a high frequency. Resistance to every antibiotic in clinical use has been observed 
      throughout the world and many strains exhibit resistance to multiple antibiotics.[
        ]In many cases, resistance to a new antibiotic 
        emerges within three years from the date of FDA approval.[] The antibiotic resistance genes(ARG) are rapidly spread by the mechanism of 
        horizontal gene transfer within and across bacterial phylogeny. 
        []Horizontal gene transfer occurs through 
        plasmids, transposons and integrons from one species to another. For example, the first 
        plasmid-mediated β­lactamase gene TEM-1 in a gram negative bacteria was 
        described in the early 1960's.[
        ] Now the TEM-1 β­lactamase gene is wide spread and is found in
        Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Haemophilus influenzae, and 
        Neisseria gonorrhoeae.[]
        Thus, antibiotic resistance genes evolve rapidly in response to the clinical/agricultural 
        use of antibiotics.[] Therefore, it is 
        of interest to collate different ARG sequences in the form of a database. The ARG sequences 
        are not available in a concerted manner in GenBank (a largest repository of gene sequences). 
        [] Hence, we developed ARGO (Antibiotic 
        Resistance Genes Online), a curated online database for storing genetic information on 
        β­lactam and vancomycin resistance genes.

Methodology of development
ARGO was developed and deployed using an open source software system. MySQL database version 
      4.0 was used to store sequence information. We used GenBank to retrieve ARG sequence data and 
      data was processed using a filtering algorithm.[] The filtering algorithm was implemented using a set of routines written in 
      Hypertext Preprocessor4 (PHP4). By definition, a GenBank record is considered for retrieving 
      ARG sequence if the LOCUS LINE contains `DNA` and `BCT`. Additionally, 
      the GENE record in the FEATURES should contain terms describing ARG (for example, `TEM` 
      or `SHV` or `VAN`). GenBank records annotated as `cloning vector` 
      were excluded from the dataset. We used these criteria to parse a local mirror of GenBank for the 
      identification of ARG. The PHP enabled database is searchable by `organism name`, 
      `country name`, `gene category` and `year of publication` of ARG. 
      The database facilitates to retrieve results in `Text` or `Table` or 
      `graphical` format. Detailed sequence and literature information can be obtained from the 
      corresponding hyperlinks. A representation of the ARGO database system and the filtering scheme is given 
      in .

Utility
The present version of ARGO contains 555 β­lactamase and 115 Vancomycin 
      resistance gene sequences reported from 1991 to 2004. An analysis of ARGO data suggests that 
      a majority of these sequences were identified in samples from Europe, Asia and North America 
      (easy sampling is possible due to the availability of advanced technologies). The global spread 
      of ARG warrants the determination of antimicrobial susceptibility of a clinical isolate for an 
      optimal antimicrobial treatment.[] In 
      recent years, nucleic acid based technologies like PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and molecular 
      beacons have been commonly employed to detect drug resistance. Hence, sequence data in ARGO 
      is of clinical importance in the diagnosis of antibiotic resistance by designing primers that are 
      both specific and sensitive. Rapid evolution of ARG demands the continuous development of new 
      antibiotics.[] However, only one class of antibiotic 
      was introduced in the last 40 years and this followed the development of a large number of 
      derivatives.[] Therefore, it is of interest 
      to predict antibiotic resistance using sequence data stored in ARGO. Determination of antibiotic 
      resistance using transposon[] and protein 
      engineering [] tools are expensive and 
      laborious. We believe that ARGO sequence data will help in the prediction of antibiotic resistance 
      using sequence profiling and molecular modeling techniques.

Future Developments
Work is in process to update ARGO with other classes of antibiotic resistance genes. The 
      database is available for free at http://www.argodb.org/
