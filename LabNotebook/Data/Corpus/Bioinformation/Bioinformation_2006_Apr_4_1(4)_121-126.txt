Background
Many biological processes such as signal transduction, transport, cellular motion and regulatory mechanisms are mediated by protein-protein interactions. 
			The study of protein-protein interactions has gained momentum for deciphering the specificity of protein-protein interfaces. Many parameters (e.g. interface 
			hydrophobicity, residue frequencies and pairing preferences at interface) have been defined to describe interface features. [,,,,,,
			] Recently, the contribution of individual residues to subunit interactions have been estimated using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, where the mutation 
			of a target residue to alanine is followed by the measure of ΔΔG (change in binding free energies), as described elsewhere. [] The binding free energy is observed to be dominantly contributed by high energy residues, called ‘hot spots’. 
			[,] For example, at the BPTI-trypsin interface, 
			hot spot Lys15→Ala mutation (ΔΔG = 10 kcal.mol-1) leads to a 200-fold decrease in association rate, while low energy residue ARG17→ALA 
	     	(ΔΔG &lt; 0.5  kcal.mol-1) has little effect on association rate. [] Therefore, 
	     	interface specificity is effectively determined by hot spots.

Because hot spots are a good indicator of interface specificity, their characteristics have been widely investigated. [,,,,,,,] Hot spots are enriched in TRP, TYR and ARG and are often surrounded by 
			hydrophobic rings to occlude bulk solvent. [] In addition, hot spots statistically correlate with 
			structurally conserved residues in ten protein families. [] Moreover, hot spots from different monomers 
			prefer to interact and their couplings are structurally conserved. [] It has also been found that hot 
			spots are related to central interface residues using the small-world network approach (proteins represented as networks, residues as nodes and interactions as 
			edges). [,]

In recent years, a number of computational methods have been developed to predict hot spots. These methods are classified into two types: (1) energy-based; 
			and (2) structure-based. In the energy-based methods, functions are developed to calculate a residue's ΔΔG by simulating residue mutation to alanine. 
			[,,,
			,,] These methods give good qualitative prediction 
			results. However, high computational cost and the difficulty in operation (e.g. data processing) make them unsuitable for easy implementation. A good example 
			of structure-based methods is the one described by Gao and colleagues. [] In this method, interface 
			residues are covered by a grid box and the contribution by each residue to binding affinity is estimated by rolling different kinds of probes (representing 
			hydrophobic group, hydrogen bonds) over the grids close to the residue. Thus, residues having high energy contribution are predicted as hot spots. This method 
			is subject to complex structural analysis and comparison. Despite these developments, a simple, robust ‘hot spot’ prediction model is still unavailable. Here, 
			we describe the analysis and the grouping of 296 alanine-scanned interface residues into three types (hot spots, warm and unimportant residues) towards the 
			development of a novel hot spot prediction model.

Methodology
Definition of interface residues
ASA (Solvent-accessible surface area) of a residue was calculated using the program NACCESS. [] A 
			residue with an interface area (ΔASA) &gt; 1Å2 is defined as an interface residue and ΔASA is the change in ASA of the 
			residue upon protein dimer formation from monomer state.

Dataset of alanine-mutated interface residues
A dataset of 296 alanine-mutated interface residues (Supplementary : column 1, 2 and 3) derived 
             from 15 protein-protein complexes (Supplementary ) was obtained from ASEdb (Alanine Scanning Energetics 
             database). [] These residues have 
             ΔΔG in the range -0.9 - 10  kcal.mol-1. The dataset was classified into three groups: hot spots (ΔΔG ≥ 
             1.5  kcal.mol-1), warm residues (0.5 - 1.5  kcal.mol-1) and unimportant residues (&lt; 0.5  kcal.mol-1), as described 
             by Gao et al., []

Definition of inter-atomic sidechain-sidechain interactions
Protein-protein complexation is determined by inter-atomic interactions between monomers. Hence, we investigated the three groups of residues (hot spots, 
             warm and unimportant residues) in terms of their contribution to the inter-atomic interactions. The inter-atomic interactions are composed of four categories, 
             namely S1S2I, S1B2I, B1S2I and B1B2I (S: sidechain atom, B: backbone 
             atom, subscript 1 and 2 refer to different monomers). The prevalence of these four 
             inter-atomic interactions at the interface of protein-protein complexes (70 non-redundant complexes []) 
             was examined by calculating their means and standard deviations at varying inter-atomic distances (). 
             S1S2I dominates at the interface and hence we exclusively selected S1S2I for studying hot spots, warm and 
             unimportant residues. By definition, two sidechain 
             atoms from different monomers were considered to interact if the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their van der Waals (vdW) radii 
             plus a cutoff distance of 0.5Å, at which cutoff the mean of S1S2I is maximum and the standard deviation is minimum 
             ().

Classification of inter-atomic sidechain-sidechain contacts
We classified inter-atomic sidechain-sidechain contacts into two groups (energetically favorable and unfavorable contacts) using the scheme described by 
            Sobolev and colleagues [] ().

Definition of NA, NAl-NAil and NCl-NCil
We investigated each residue in the dataset using (1) NA, (2) NAl-NAil and (3) NCl-NCil (Supplementary 
            table 1),illustrated in . NA is the number of atoms of a residue participating in sidechain-sidechain contacts. 
            NAl-NAil is the difference between the number of atoms in favorable contacts (NAl) and unfavorable contacts (NAil). It
             was employed to explore energetic contribution for a residue to protein-protein interface in terms of atoms. NCl-NCil is the difference 
             between favorable contacts (NCl) and unfavorable contacts (NCil). It was used to explore energetic contribution for a residue to 
             protein-protein interface in terms of inter-atomic contacts.

Results
Our goal is to investigate the characteristics of hot spots by comparing them with other interface residues using inter-atomic interactions. We collected 
			296 alanine-scanning interface residues consisting of 83 hot spots, 80 warm residues and 133 unimportant residues. At the interfaces of subunit interactions, 
			S1S2I (side chain ‐ side chain interaction) dominates and thus, S1S2I was subsequently used in this study. It should be noted that GLY (lacking side chains) 
			was disregarded in this analysis. However, the current dataset contains only two Gly residues and neither of them is a hot spot. Thus, the elimination of Gly 
			did not significantly effect the analysis. For each residue in the dataset, we calculated the number of atoms (NA) participating in S1S2I, the number of atoms 
			involved in favorable contacts (NAl) and unfavorable contacts (NAil). The number of favorable contacts (NCl) and unfavorable 
			contacts (NCil) were further calculated. We used these values to calculate NA, NAl-NAil and NCl-NCil for 
			each residue to compare the difference between hot spots, warm and unimportant residues (Supplementary : column 5, 
			6 and 7).

NA
 shows percentage distributions of the three types of interface residues (hot spots, warm and unimportant 
			residues) based on the value of NA. The percentage of hot spots increases from 15% to 50% with NA, while that of unimportant residues decreases 
			from 60% to 23%. Interestingly, the percentage of warm residues does not significantly change with NA. This suggests that S1S2I interactions are 
			prominent among hot spots. When NA = 1, the percentage of warm residues (41%) are larger than that in the original dataset (27%) and when 
			NA &gt; 1 hot spots (&gt;33%) are higher than that in the original dataset (28%). It should be noted that nearly 40% of the residues 
			in the dataset do not participate in inter-atomic sidechain-sidechain contacts (NA = 0). Hence, these residues can not be identified as hot spots, warm and 
			unimportant residues using NA, NAl-NAil and NCl-NCil values.

NAl-NAil
 shows percentage distributions of hot spots, warm and unimportant residues based on 
            NAl-NAil. The percentages of unimportant residues decrease with the increase in NAl-NAil, and that of hot spots 
            increases. The percentage of warm residues is not significantly affected by NAl-NAil. We also show that when 
            NAl-NAil &gt; 1, the percentage of hot spots is larger than the fraction of hot spots in the original dataset (28%).

NCl-NCil
 shows percentage distribution of the three types of interface residues types based on 
 	        NCl - NCil. The percentage of unimportant residues decreases with the increase in 
 	        NCl-NCil, and hot spots increases. 
 	        The percentage of warm residues does not significantly change with NCl-NCil. It was also found that the percentage of hot spots is high 
 	        when NCl-NCil ≥ 2, in comparison to the fraction (28%) of hot spots in the original dataset.

Discussion
A ‘hot spot’ prediction approach
Results show that the fraction of hot spots increases and unimportant residues decreases with increase in NA, NAl-NAil and 
			NCl-NCil. However, the fraction of warm residues is not significantly affected by these three parameters. Thus, hot spots are 
			preferentially involved in strong and energetically favorable sidechain-sidechain interactions, unimportant residues tend to participate in weak and 
			energetically unfavorable sidechain-sidechain interactions. Here, we used NA, NAl-NAil and NCl-NCil to develop 
			a method to identify hot spots using interface residues in structural complexes. We classified the residues in our dataset using a combination of three 
			parameters. This is based on the observation that hot spots are prevailing in residues with NA &gt; 1, NAl-NAi l &gt; 1 or 
			NCl-NCil &gt; 1, and unimportant residues are predominant in those with NA = 0, 
			NAl-NAil ≤ 1 or 
			NCl-NCi l ≤ 1 ( and ).  shows that the percentages of unimportant residues when (i) NA = 0, (ii) NA = 1 &amp;&amp; 
			NAl-NAil ≤ 1 &amp;&amp; 
			NCl-NCi l≤ 1, and (vi) NA &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; NAl-NAil 
			≤ 1 &amp;&amp; NCl-NCil ≤ 1 
			are larger than that in original dataset; and hot spots in (iii) NA = 1 &amp;&amp; NAl-NAil ≤ 1 &amp;&amp; 
			NCl-NCil ≥ 2, (vii) NA &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; NAl-NAil 
			≤ 1 &amp;&amp; NCl-NCil ≥ 2, 
			and (ix) NA &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; NAl-NAil ≥ 2 &amp;&amp; 
			NCl-NCil ≥ 2 are higher than original dataset. 
			Thus, the residues with NCl-NCil ≥ 2 could be predicted as hot spots and those with 
			NCl-NCil ≤ 1 as unimportant 
			residues. Therefore, these observations find application in the development of an expert system for the identification of hot spots from structural complexes.

Comparison with other ‘hot spot’ predication methods
We evaluated our ‘hot spot’ prediction method by comparing them with three other methods: (1) PP_SITE [], 
		(2) alanine scanning method developed by Kortemme and coworkers [] and (3) FOLDEF. [] The PP_SITE method is structure-based, while the other two are energy-based. We assessed the performance of the four methods in distinguishing 
		hot spots and unimportant residues. The PP_SITE classified interface residues into three types (hot spots, warm and unimportant residues) and its predicted warm residues 
		include 43% of experimental hot spots []. In Alanine Scanning and FOLDEF methods, we considered 
		interface residues with calculated ΔΔG ≥ 1  kcal.mol-1 as predicted hot spots and other residues as predicted unimportant residues.

The four methods were evaluated using our dataset of 296 interface residues. The FOLDEF and our method identified all the 296 residues, while the PP_SITE method 
		identified 226 residues and alanine scanning method identified 261 residues (See supplementary ). Then, we retained 
		the identified residues which belong to experimental hot spots and unimportant residues (FOLDEF and our method: 215 residues; PP_SITE: 160 residues; Alanine 
		scanning: 187 residues). Finally, for each method, we calculated sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value 
		(NPV)and average successful rate ((TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FN+FP)) for hot spot prediction ().

Our method and FOLDEF showed high average successful rate (71% - 72%), compared to the other two methods (PP_SITE: 66%; Alanine Scanning: 
		68%). Thus, the FOLDEF and our method can effectively distinguish between hot spots and unimportant residues. Our method efficiently identified hot spots 
		(SN = 72%; SP = 72%), while the FOLDEF efficiently identified unimportant residues (SN = 45%; SP = 88%). In addition, the PP_SITE 
		correctly identified most host spots (SN = 90%) in these methods. However, it could not effectively differentiate unimportant residues from hot spots (SP = 
		37%). It agreed with the conclusions drawn by Gao et al. that the PP_SITE over-estimated unimportant residues. From these analyses, we can see that our 
		method has remarkable hot spot prediction accuracy relative to the prevailing prediction approaches.

Misidentified hot spots
Out of the 83 hot spots in our dataset, 23 were not predicted, 17 of which do not have sidechain-sidechain interactions (NA = 0) and the remaining five do not 
		make significant energetic contribution to sidechain-sidechain interactions (NCl-NCil = 1). It seems that energetic contribution of these hot 
		spots to protein-protein interaction could not be reflected by their participation in inter-monomeric sidechain-sidechain interactions. In order to understand how 
		the 23 misidentified hot spots contribute to protein-protein interaction, they were studied in detail and several reasons were found. (1) Some of them interact with 
		interfacial water molecules to enhance the stability of protein-protein interaction. For instance, the residue D51 in the protein Im9 (PDB: 1BXI) hydrogen bonds 
		two interfacial water molecules buried in cavities. [] (2) Some neighbor with hot spots with 
		NCl - NCil ≥ 2. The mutations to alanine may influence their neighboring hot spot's conformation which then reduces 
		protein-protein interaction. In human growth hormone-hGH receptor complex (PDB: 3hhr), misidentified hot spots I103 (ΔΔG =1.8  kcal.mol-1) 
		and I105 (ΔΔG =2.0  kcal.mol-1) neighbor hot spot W104 (ΔΔG =4.5  kcal.mol-1). (3) Some have role in stabilizing 
		monomer structure so that their mutations to alanine disrupt monomer conformation which weakens protein-protein interactions, such as the residue D58 in Tissue 
		Factor (PDB: 1DAN). [] (4) Some contribute to protein-protein interaction by participating in 
		backbone-backbone or backbone-sidechain interactions. The residue K15 in protein Basic Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (PDB: 1CBW) are involved in three 
		backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds. [] Similarly, the residues N23 and Q120 in Staphylococcal enterotoxin 
		C3 (PDB: 1JCK) form hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of interacting monomer T cell antigen receptor Vβ. []

Distinction between specific and non-specific complexes
Assessing the oligomeric state of a protein from its X-ray structure is not always straightforward and protein subunit interfaces often coexist with 6 to 
		12 packing interfaces. [,] The distinction between 
		oligomers (specific complexes) and crystal-packing artifacts (non-specific complexes) is often made on the basis of interface area and specific interface area 
		is generally larger. [,,] Recently, Bahadur et al. observed that three independent parameters (non-polar interface area, fraction of fully buried atoms and 
		residue propensity score at interface) could distinguish between homo-dimers and non-specific complexes and these are indistinguishable based on interface area. 
		[] Here, we used our ‘hot spot’ prediction method to distinguish between specific and 
		non-specific complexes, using the dataset of Bahadur et al. which contains 188 large crystal-packing artifacts, 122 homo-dimers and 70 
		hetero-dimers.  show that the low abundance of hot spots distinguishes the crystal-packing interfaces from homo-dimeric 
		interfaces. Using the number (23) of hot spots as a cutoff, 179 out of 188 non-specific interfaces and 88 out of 122 homo-dimeric interfaces were identified. In 
		other words, 86% of the proteins are correctly classified as monomers and homo-dimers using hot spots as a criterion. The hot spot cutoff was selected 
		manually in this study and with larger data sets, the cutoff has to be refined to optimized, for the distinction between homo-dimers and monomers. We also 
		calculated the correlations between the number of hot spots and the three parameters observed by Bahadur et al. and found a weak correlation 
		(correlation coefficient R2 &lt; 0.17). Thus, the ‘hot spot’ prediction method could be applied along with these three parameters for 
		homo-dimer identification. However, the prediction method could not efficiently distinguish between hetero-dimers and non-specific complexes. This may be due to 
		the binding mechanism of hetero-dimers, which assemble from preformed protein components. In the free components, the surface patches that form the interface are 
		in contact with the solvent and their physical/chemical properties are not significantly different from the remainder of protein surface.

        The interaction of K15 (PDB ID: BPTI, Chain I) to S190, S195 and V213 (trypsin, Chain E) is shown (PDB ID: 2PTC). 
        K15 has three interacting side-chain atoms (CB, CD and NZ) and therefore the NA value is 3. Therein, the three atoms are all involved in favorable contacts (green 
        line) and only CB participates in unfavorable contacts (red line). Thus, the NAl value is 3 and NAil 
        is 1. In addition, K15 has three favorable contacts and one 
        unfavorable contact; hence NCl is 3 and NCil is 1. Carbon atom: white; oxygen atom: red; Nitrogen atom: blue.
