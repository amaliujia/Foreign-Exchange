Background
Eugenol (compound 1) is an essential oil mainly found in the
buds and leaves of clove (Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merrill and
Perry []. This essential oil has some biological activities, e.g.,
antiinfective (i.e., antibacterial, anthelmintic, antifungal,
antiplasmodial and antiviral), anti-inflammatory, analgesic,
antioxidant, antimutagenic, antigenotoxic, modulatory and
anticancer [,
]. As an anticancer, eugenol inhibits cell
proliferation and induces apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast
cancer cells [,
]. This type of cancer is the most common form
among women []. Therefore, drug discovery efforts by
exploring the potency of eugenol in order to develop novel and
potent pharmaceuticals for breast cancer therapy are of
considerable interest.

The biological activities of eugenol in human breast cancer cells
can be correlated to its potential activity as an estrogen receptor
α (ER) antagonist [–]. Interestingly, the standard adjuvant for
postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor–positive early
breast cancer Tamoxifen (Astra Zeneca) is an ER antagonist 
[].
Tamoxifen itself is a prodrug that is metabolized in the liver
results in some active metabolites (e.g., 4-hydroxytamoxifen
and N-desmethyl-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen), with 30-100 fold
activity in the binding to ER compared to its original form 
[].
On the other hand, compared to tamoxifen and its metabolites,
eugenol can be considered as a small fragment that has a
potency to be developed further in a direction guided by a
computer-aided structure-based design [,
] to have
compounds that have similar or even better affinities to ER than
tamoxifen and its metabolites.

We described previously the construction and validation of the
structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) protocols to discover
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors []. In this article, similar
approaches were employed to construct and validate SBVS
protocols to discover potent ER antagonist. Fortunately, similar
to the retrospective validation of the SBVS to discover COX-2
inhibitors, the dataset to retrospectively validate SBVS protocols
to discover potent ER antagonist has been made publicly
available in the directory of useful decoys (DUD;
http://dud.docking.org/r2/er_antagonist.tar.gz) 
[]. The
validated protocol has a better enrichment factor in 1% false
positive (EF1%) compared to the first SBVS campaign using
DUD to retrospectively identify ER antagonists []. Moreover,
the EF1% value of the validated protocol constructed here is
significantly higher than the average value (17.3) resulted from
the first SBVS campaign of 40 targets employing DUD and can
therefore be considered as acceptable []. The validated
protocol was subsequently employed to virtually screen
eugenol (compound 1), its analogues (compounds 2-7) and their
dimers (8-14). None of the compounds show better docking
score as compared to the threshold compound of the EF1%
value. However, instead of being considered as drug-like
compounds, the screened compounds are considered as
fragments that can be developed further [,
]. Therefore, by
employing docking score ligand efficiency (DSLE; the absolute
value of docking score divided by number of heavy atoms)
value these initial results guide us to select dimer 11 (4-[4-
hydroxy-3-(prop-2-en-1-yl)phenyl]-2-(prop-2-en-1-yl)phenol) as
the most potential fragment to be developed further in order to
discover novel and potent ER antagonists.

Methodology
Molecular docking protocol construction and internal validation:
The crystal structure of human ER bound to 4-
hydroxytamoxifen (PDB code: 3ERT;
http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/files/3ERT.pdb.gz) was used as the
reference target [,
]. By employing SPORES 
[] subjected
to the reference target, the virtual target file (protein.mol2) was
prepared. The binding pocket of ER was defined by the
coordinates of the co-crystalized 4-hydroxytamoxifen in the
3ERT structure and a radius of 12.8 Å, which is the maximum
distance from the center defined by a 5 Å [] radius around 4-
hydroxytamoxifen. In the visual inspection of the 3ERT
structure, a water molecule in the binding pocket was observed.
As the representative of the water molecule, a file named
water.mol2 was then prepared. Two PLANTS 
[] configuration
files were then prepared: 
the configuration that ignores the conserved water molecule (plantsconfig) and

the configuration that involves the conserved water molecule (water_plantsconfig).


For each configuration the internal
validation was performed by redocking the co-crystalized
ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen into the virtual target using the
docking software PLANTS1.2 [] and subsequently compared
the docking pose to the original crystal structure pose 
[,
].
In order to avoid bias, instead of using the co-crystalized ligand
as the starting point, the optimized state of the lowest energy
conformer of the co-crystalized ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen was
used as the input ligand. By employing Open Babel 2.2.3 
[],
hydrogen atoms in pH 7.4 was added to the input ligand by
module babel –p 7.4 and followed by module obconformer to
perform conformer search using Monte Carlo simulations with
maximum 250 conformers and followed by energy optimization
using steepest descent method with maximum 100 steps.

Retrospective SBVS validation:
The ER antagonists and decoys were obtained from DUD
website (http://dud.docking.org/r2/) 
[]. The compounds
were treated similar to the co-crystal ligand in the input ligand
preparation described in the previous subsection. The prepared
input ligands were subsequently screened using PLANTS1.2
[]. For each configuration, a retrospective SBVS campaign
was performed independently. The compounds were then
ranked based on the scores and the EF1% values were calculated.
The quality of the screening procedures was judged by
comparing the EF1% value to EF1% of the first retrospective SBVS
campaign on ER antagonist using DUD (12.1) [].

SBVS on eugenol analogs:
Eugenol (compound 1), its analogues (compounds 2-7) and
their dimers (8-14) were virtually screened using the selected
SBVS protocols. Their docking scores were then compared to
the docking score of the compound located in the EF1% in the
ranked dataset resulted from the selected SBVS validation.
Additional objective function called docking score ligand
efficiency (DSLE = |docking score/number of heavy atom|)
[] was used to rank the potency of eugenol and its analogs to
be developed further [].

All computational simulations were performed on a Dell Power
Edge 1900 server with Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz dual core as the
processors and 3 GB of RAM and Linux version 2.6.32-30-
generic (Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid) as the operating system.

Results and Discussion
The aim of this research was to construct a validated SBVS
protocol to discover potent ER antagonist and subsequently use
the protocol to virtually screen small fragments eugenol and its
analogs in order to develop novel and potent ER antagonists.
Potential small fragments with low potency but high ligand
efficiency recognized in a SBVS campaign can successfully lead
to high affinity ligand after structure-based optimization 
[,
,
].

The crystal structure with PDB code of 3ERT, which was used
in the reference SBVS protocol using DUD, was selected as the
reference target [,
]. This crystal structure has an acceptable
resolution (1.90 Å) and the ER in this crystal structure was cocrystalized
with ligand 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a high affinity ER
antagonist with binding affinity (Ki) value in the range of
nanomolar concentrations []. By visual inspection of the
crystal structure 3ERT, the optimal protein-ligand interactions
can be studied. There were 70 residues recognized as the
binding pocket residues: LEU327, TYR328, SER329, GLU330,
SER341, MET342, MET343, GLY344, LEU345, LEU346, THR347,
ASN348, LEU349, ALA350, ASP351, ARG352, GLU353, LEU354,
VAL355, MET357, LEU379, GLU380, CYS381, ALA382, TRP383,
LEU384, GLU385, ILE386, LEU387, MET388, ILE389, GLY390,
LEU391, VAL392, ARG394, SER395, LEU402, LEU403, PHE404,
ALA405, LEU408, LEU410, GLY415, VAL418, GLU419, GLY420,
MET421, VAL422, GLU423, ILE424, PHE425, LEU428, ILE514,
HIS516, MET517, SER518, ASN519, LYS520, GLY521, MET522,
GLU523, HIS524, LEU525, TYR526, SER527, MET528, LYS529,
CYS530, LEU536, and LEU539. Interestingly, one water
molecule was observed in the binding pocket and this water
molecule can be considered as conserved []. Two hydrogen
bonds networks were observed during the visual inspection: 
the 4-hydroxy moiety of the 4-hydroxytamoxifen with the conserved water molecule and residues GLU353 and ARG394, and

the (2-hydroxyethyl) dimethylazanium moiety of the 4- hydroxytamoxifen with residues THR347 and ASP351.


the (2-hydroxyethyl) dimethylazanium moiety of the 4-
hydroxytamoxifen with residues THR347 and ASP351. Proper
constraints can lead to the increase of SBVS quality significantly
[,
]. In this SBVS construction, however, no constrain has
introduced yet. Instead, the default configuration that ignores
the conserved water molecule and the configuration that
involves the conserved water molecule were constructed and
compared.

The internal validation was aimed to examine whether the
docking simulation used by the SBVS protocols can reproduce
the pose of the co-crystal ligand []. The objective function
used in the internal validation was the root mean square
distance (RMSD) value between the heavy atoms of the docked
pose and the crystal structure pose. The default configuration
resulted in the RMSD value of 1.670 Å, while the configuration
that took into account the conserved water molecule resulted in
the RMSD value of 1.403 Å. Although the configuration
considering the conserved water molecule gave a slightly better
RMSD value, since a protocol is acceptable if the RMSD value is
less than 2.0 [], both protocols can be considered as
acceptable. Interestingly, the docked poses resulted from both
protocols still maintain the hydrogen bonds networks with
residues THR347, ASP351, GLU353, and ARG394, though the
default protocol did not involve the conserved water molecule.

The reference retrospective SBVS campaign using DUD showed
EF1% value of 12.7 []. Moreover, the most recent retrospective
SBVS campaign using enhanced DUD showed EF1% value of 15
[]. Remarkably, the independent retrospective SBVS
campaigns using DUD dataset employing PLANTS1.2
described here showed that the default protocol resulted in
EF1% value of 15.9 and the protocol that involved the conserved
water molecule resulted in EF1%value of 21.2. Both values give
better EF1% value compared to the reference SBVS campaigns.
Notably, the SBVS protocol that involved the conserved water
molecule gave significantly higher EF1%value compared to
others. This indicates that the conserved water molecule plays
an important role in the SBVS campaigns to identify ER
antagonists. The EF1%value of the validated protocol
constructed here (21.2) is above the average value (17.3)
resulted from the first SBVS campaign of 40 targets employing
DUD []. Thus, the SBVS protocol that involved the conserved
water molecule is therefore acceptable and selected for further
SBVS campaign in subsequent prospective efforts. Using the
EF1%value, a reference compound that can be used as the
threshold compound in the prospective SBVS was recognized.
The compound is ZINC01914469 (compound 15), an ER
antagonist with IC50 value of 69.23 nM 
[].

The prospective screening results of eugenol (1), its analogues
(2-7) and their dimers (8-14) together with compound 15 as the
reference compound are presented in  (see
supplementary material). None of the screened compound
shows a better ChemPLP score as compared to compound 15.
However, in order to rank the small fragments 1-14 to be
developed further, another objective value named DSLE is
introduced. This value is a modified ligand efficiency 
[]
which uses docking score instead of the observed affinity.

According to , eugenol and its analogs in this research
resulted in higher DSLE values than the reference compound
15. This indicates that compounds 1-7 can serve as good starting
points in the development of novel and potent ER antagonists.
In order to narrow the degree of freedom in the further
development, initial design by dimerization (compounds 8-14)
was proposed. The prospective SBVS campaign showed that the
success of the strategy was monomer dependent since
compounds 8, 10, 13 and 14 were shown significant decrease in
the DSLE values, which were lower than the DSLE value of the
reference compound. Notably, the dimer 11 4-[4-hydroxy-3-
(prop-2-en-1-yl) phenyl]-2-(prop-2-en-1-yl) phenol showed the
highest DSLE value among the dimers and therefore has been
suggested to be developed further. The superposition of the
docked poses of compounds 11 and 15 is presented in 
(). Based on 
(), the phenolic moieties nearest to the
conserved water molecule of both compound 11 and 15 are
located very similar. This creates the hydrogen bonds network
to residues GLU353 and ARG394.However, compound 11 lacks
of basic moiety that can bind to residue ASP351. Therefore the
recommended design strategy to develop compound 11 is to
add at least a basic moiety in the similar position to basic
moiety of compound 15. Subsequently, another phenol moiety
to fulfill the hydrophobic pocket possessed by compound 15
can be added to increase the affinity ().

Conclusion
The construction and the retrospective validation of SBVS
protocols to identify ER antagonists have successfully provided
a valid tool to screen potential ER antagonists virtually. The
validated protocol has an EF1% of 21.2, which is considered as
acceptable. The validation processes have also revealed that the
conserved water molecule in the binding pocket of the crystal
structure 3ERT plays an important role in the quality of the
SBVS protocol. Subsequent prospective screen on eugenol, its
analogs and their dimers has suggested dimer 11 4-[4-hydroxy-
3-(prop-2-en-1-yl)phenyl]-2-(prop-2-en-1-yl)phenol to be
developed further in order to discover novel and potent ER
antagonists.
