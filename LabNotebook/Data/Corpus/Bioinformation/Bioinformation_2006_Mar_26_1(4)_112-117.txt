Background
AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome) is a major epidemic caused by HIV (human immuno-deficiency virus) and significant efforts are being made for 
			years to develop drugs against the dreadful disease. The HIV genome encodes for the protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. The HIV integrase 
			contains three functional domains. [] Interestingly, HIV integrase has no sequence homologue in the 
			human host and hence, it is considered as a potential drug target. [] The integrase protein has 
			three domains, namely, the N-terminal domain stabilized by Zn2+ [,
			,], the DNA binding C-terminal domain [] and 
			the catalytic domain consisting of residues Asp64, Asp116, and Glu152 forming the active site. The catalytic triad is essential for enzymatic activity with 
			metal cofactors. [,] The structure of the C-terminal 
			and N-terminal domains of the HIV-1 integrase were solved by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) [,,], whereas, the catalytic domain of HIV integrase was determined 
			by x-ray crystallography. [,] A number of natural 
			products inhibiting integrase have been reported, recently. [] The macromolecular crystallography 
			laboratory identified three structurally related inhibitors called Y-1, Y-2 and Y-3. Among them, Y-3 () showed maximum integrase 
			inhibition. [] Y-3 interacts with the flexible loop of the enzyme's active site and induces loop 
			conformation change. Pre-incubation of integrase with metal cations did not prevent Y3 inhibition. [] 
			Pharmacophores describing interactions between integrase and ligands are important in drug screening. Inhibitors with high potency, solubility and reduced 
			toxicity are generally considered for clinical trials. [] Here, we describe the design of potential 
			inhibitors for HIV integrase using a pharmacophore model.

Methodology
Integrase catalytic domain structure
The three dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of the HIV-1 integrase protein (PDB ID: 1BI4) was obtained from PDB (Protein Data 
			Bank). [] This domain consists of a five-stranded beta-sheet with six surrounding helices. 

Pharmacophore model
We analyzed the binding pockets of the integrase catalytic domain using PASS (a tool that uses geometry to characterize regions of buried volume in 
             proteins) to identify positions likely to represent binding sites based on size, shape and volume buried [] (). LigBuilder (a program for structure-based drug design) was used to build ligand 
             molecules within the binding pocket of the HIV-1 integrase catalytic domain. [] A pharmacophore 
             model for receptor active site was derived using the POCKET module in LigBuilder. It should be noted that the previously proposed pharmacophore models 
             were based on already known HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. [,]

Inhibitor design
The 3D database searching methods that search for inhibitors in known compounds have been described elsewhere. [,,] A dynamic pharmacophore 
             model (screen a database of chemical compounds) for HIV-1 integrase was also available. [,
             ,] Here, we describe a pharmacophore model using receptor 
             active site and key interaction sites for Y-3 inhibitor as a seed compound. The model was used for constructing novel ligand molecules within the constraints 
             of the target intergrase using the LigBuilder program. A total of 3000 ligand molecules were constructed using the GROW module in LigBuilder.

Compounds generation
An initial population was generated based on the seed structure and the parent molecules are copied into the mating pool. Thus, a new population was 
			generated by performing structural manipulations to the molecules in the mating pool. The generated molecules were analyzed using the PROCESS module in 
			LigBuilder. A set of 500 molecules meeting the chemical criteria setup in the parameter file in PROCESS module were filtered and then converted into viewable 
			Mol2 formatted files. LigBuilder estimates binding affinities using the SCORE v2.08 algorithm [] 
			and LogP values using the XLOGP v2.0 algorithm [] for each compound. These 500 molecules were 
			then clustered into 21 groups based on structural similarity. The compounds were then tested for Lipinski's Rule of Five using the Molinspiration server. 
			[]

Ligand binding
The AutoDock3.0/ADT [] program was used to investigate ligand binding to HIV-1 integrase 
			using a grid encompassing the active site surface. The AutoDock program combines a rapid energy evaluation through pre-calculated grids of affinity 
			potentials with a variety of search algorithms to find suitable binding positions. The affinity and electrostatic maps were computed with a grid spacing 
			of 0.375 Å and the grid points in x, y and z axis were set to 58x58x56. The search was based on the Lamarckian genetic algorithm and the results were 
			analyzed using binding energy. The cluster analysis was performed based on RMSD (root mean square deviation). For each ligand, a docking experiment 
			consisting of 10 simulations was performed. The ligand molecules were then ranked in order of increasing docking energies and grouped into clusters 
			of similar conformation. The Swiss-PdbViewer was then used to generate images of protein structures docked with potential compounds.

Results and Discussion
A static pharmacophore model was developed using LigBuilder based on the crystal structure of HIV-1 integrase bound with the Y-3 inhibitor 
			(4-acetylamino-5-hydroxynaphthalene-2, 7-disulfonic acid).  and , shows the interaction between Y-3 inhibitor and active site residues Asp64, 
			Asp116, Glu152 in the catalytic domain of integrase. In , nitrogen atoms (blue) represent hydrogen-bond donor 
			sites; oxygen atoms (red) represent hydrogen-bond acceptor sites; and carbon atoms (green) represent hydrophobic sites. Using the pharmacophore model, 500 
			out of the initial 3000 molecules satisfying the minimum chemical criteria were identified for further analysis (). 
			The 500 compounds were then grouped in 21 different clusters using structural similarity. A molecule from each cluster was chosen based on binding affinity to 
			integrase. Fourteen (structures given in ) of the twenty-one molecules satisfied the Lipinski's rule of five with 
			zero violations (). A useful parameter for predicting drug transport properties is TPSA (Topological Molecular 
			polar surface area) and it is determined for these molecules. A topological parameter is number of rotatable bonds and it describes the molecular flexibility 
			of these compounds. This parameter was calculated for the fourteen molecules that satisfy the ‘rule-of-5’ and it is found that all the molecules have rotatable 
			bonds in the range of 2-6 ().

All docking calculations were carried out using AutoDock3.0/ADT. Each of the fourteen molecules was docked into the active site of integrase that is fixed 
			with flexible ligands. A smaller grid, concentrating on the catalytic domain of integrase was used for 10 simulations. The docked conformation with the lowest 
			free binding of energy was then probed for further analysis. The docking results revealed a consistent set of binding characteristics for the 14 molecules 
			with HIV-1 integrase (). AutoDock calculated RMSD value, free energy and the docked energy values for the 
			resulting fourteen structures (). Thus, we demonstrate the building of small-molecule inhibitors for HIV-1 
			integrase using a pharmacophore model.

Conclusion
The purpose of this study is to generate novel compounds as HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. A receptor based pharmacophore model was developed for HIV-1 
			integrase with a variety of pharmacophore features (hydrogen-bond acceptor and donor, hydrophobic, and excluded volumes). In this study, fourteen molecules 
			were identified as potential integrase inhibitors. Docking results from using AutoDock illustrated the molecular interactions between the 14 compounds and 
			the HIV-1 integrase. Further studies on their binding properties will provide useful information towards the rational design of effective HIV-1 integase 
			inhibitors.
