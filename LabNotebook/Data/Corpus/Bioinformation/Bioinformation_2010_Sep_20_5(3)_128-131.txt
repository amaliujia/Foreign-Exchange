Background
The genus Curcuma of the family Zingiberaceae constitutes 80 species all
over Asia, South East Asia and Africa []. 
Turmeric, also known as the “golden spice” is one of the most 
important herbs in the tropical and subtropical countries. Turmeric rhizome is 
valued world over and has been in use from ancient time as a spice, food preservative, 
coloring agent, and in the traditional systems of medicine 
[]. 
Its medicinal uses are indeed diverse, ranging from cosmetic face cream to the prevention of
Alzheimer's disease. Turmeric is also qualified as the queen of natural
Cox‐2 inhibitors []. 
India is the world's largest producer, and exporter of
turmeric followed by China, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Thailand 
[]. The
International Trade Centre, Geneva, has estimated an annual growth rate of
10% in the world demand for turmeric. Conventional crop improvement
methods are not suitable in turmeric because it is not only completely
sterile but also propagate exclusively by vegetative means.
Characterization of Curcuma longa using molecular markers is very
limited excepting a few sporadic reports on isozyme studies and genetic
stability studies using RAPD [,
]. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that
the genotypic diversity of exclusively asexually reproducing plants like
turmeric will be lost in the long course of evolution. Hence, the
development of reliable and reproducible molecular markers in turmeric is
highly essential to assess the genetic diversity for germplasm conservation
and crop improvement

Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are stretches of DNA
consisting of tandemly repeated short units of 1‐6 base pairs in length.
Compared with other molecular markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
are more advantageous because of their simplicity, high information, and
co dominant nature and because they can be rapidly screened and analyzed
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. In addition,
SSR loci are present not only in the non‐coding regions of genes but are
also widely distributed in the coding regions. Microsatellites are
categorized into two groups‐ class I hypervariable markers with ≥20
repeats and class II potentially variable markers with ≤20 repeats. The
standard method for development of genomic SSRs is highly time
consuming and labor‐intensive []. 
Recent advances in Curcuma genomic technologies have generated a large number 
of expressed sequence tags(ESTs) that has been made available in public database, thereby offering
an opportunity to develop EST derived SSR markers by data mining. ESTs
are short and single pass sequences read from mRNA (cDNA) 
[]
representing a snapshot of genes expressed in a given tissue and or at a
given developmental stage. As of July 2010, GenBank had released 12593
EST sequences from Curcuma longa. In this context, the use of EST or
cDNA‐based SSRs has been reported for several species including grape
[], sugarcane 
[], durum wheat 
[] and rye 
[].

Keeping in view the above, the objectives of the research described in this
paper were to assess the potential of existing public databases for the
discovery of simple sequence repeats. We have mined updated EST tissue
libraries of Curcuma longa for this analysis to find the SSR
polymorphisms. SSR detecting software SciRoKo was used to identify the
SSR polymorphisms. There are other SSR detecting softwares such as
MISA [], SSRFinder 
[], SSRIT 
[], TRF 
[], TROLL 
[], Sputnik
(
http://espressosoftware.com/pages/sputnik. jsp), Modified Sputnik I 
[]
and Modified Sputnik II [] 
but SciRoKo (SSR Classification and Investigation by Robert Kofler) 
[] 
is the only software with user‐friendly interface with a statistical analysis of 
genomic microsatellites and interpret results as html files.

Methodology
EST database of NCBI contains 12953 Curcuma longa express sequence
tag data. We have mined 12593 EST sequences consisting of two tissue
libraries of rhizomes 6870 (DY395309‐DY388440) and leaves 5723
(DY388439‐DY382717). The EST sequences were screened against the
UniVec database from NCBI (
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/ UniVec/) for
detecting vector and adapter sequences by using the program Cross_Match
[Li et al 2006]; the following parameters were used: minmatch ≥13 and
minscore ≥20. Furthermore, polyA/T tails and X characters were removed
using the EST_trimmer.pl script (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/download/est_trimmer.pl) 
until no stretch of (A/T)5 or (X)1 was present in a window of 100bp at the 5′ or 3′ end, 
respectively. CAP3 program was used to assemble the EST sequence into contigs for creating a
non‐redundant dataset. The SSR detection tool SciRoKo version 1.0 
[]
was used to detect EST‐SSR loci. SciRoKo required inputs in fasta format.

Discussion
Large-scale sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags and complete
genomes offers information of use to plant breeding programs. With the
completion of the first crop genome sequencing projects 
[] the potential
for plant breeding to be impacted by new technology has never been
greater. A total of 12953 redundant EST sequences were retrieved from
NCBI database representing about 8.4 Mb of Curcuma longa genome.
During pre‐processing, 38366Bp of empty vectors, low‐quality sequences
and Poly A/T tails were removed successfully. After sequence redundant
analysis, 7139 unique sequences with combined length of 5.11 Mb were
obtained and were used for mining of hyper variable class I microsatellites.
Using the SciRoKo SSR mining program, while searching for SSRs with
1‐6 nucleotide repeat motifs, 568 hypervariable SSR loci were observed
(Table 3 see ). 
The frequency of SSR loci in turmeric EST was found to be one SSR in every 14.73 kb of EST sequence
(Table 1 see ) that is higher as compared to
earlier retrieved data of one SSR per 17.96 Kb []. 
Cardle et al  []
estimated the average distances between SSRs in sets of non-redundant
ESTs in poplar (1/14.0 kb), cotton (1/20.0 kb), Arabidopsis (1/13.8 kb),
maize (1/8.1 kb), rice (1/3.4 kb), tomato (1/11.1 kb) and soybean (1/7.4
kb). This clearly suggests that, with the increase in the transcript data of
plants, SSR estimation in ESTs will become more precise and reliable.

The mined EST‐SSRs were classified according to their structure into the
simple motif type, with a single motif; and compound type, with more than
two motifs. Among the 568 EST‐SSRs, most (98.92%) consisted of simple
repeats with no interruptions in the motif; whereas only six loci (1.05 %) were of the compound type 
(table 2 see).
Among the 1‐6 repeat types, the most abundant repeat type was the
trinucleotide repeat type, which accounted for 41.19% of the total,
followed by the mononucleotide (20.07%) and hexanucleotide types
(15.14%). The dinucleotide, tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide types
accounted for only 9.68%, 6.16% and 6.69% respectively. Many studies
have suggested that the trinucleotide repeat is the main EST‐SSR repeat
type in most plants, followed by the dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat
types [,
] . However, the most abundant motif 
in the trinucleotide repeat type differed among plants 
[]. Kantety et al 
[] showed that the
(CCG)n repeat motif accounted for 32% and 49% of all repeat motifs in
wheat and sorghum, respectively. Gupta et al. [] found that the (AAG)n
repeat was the most abundant motif in the trinucleotide repeat type. In a
similar study Lu et al 2010, have found (AAG)n to be the most abundant
repeat motif in Gossypium barbadense. Siju et al 
[] also found (AAG)n
to be the most abundant in turmeric accounting to 8.2%.

The dominance of trimeric SSRs observed in the present study could be
attributed to the fact that the suppression of non‐trimeric SSRs in the
coding regions leads to frame shift mutations []. 
Moreover, we also found that the frequency of mononucleotide (20.072%) and hexanucleotide
(15.142%) repeats was more as compared to other repeat motifs. This
suggests that the functions of EST‐SSRs derived from Curcuma longa may
be different form other members of the Zingiberaceae family. In all the
repeat motifs, most of the SSR repeat motifs derived from the ESTs were
A/T (16.542%) followed by AAG/CTT (11.442%), AGG/CTT (10.912%) and
AG/CT (5.282%) (). 
Rest of the repeat motifs accounted less than 52% contribution to 
the total SSR motifs. In the 1‐6 repeat types, the most frequent repeat motifs were
 A/T, AG/CT, AAG/CTT, AAAC/GTTT, AAAAC/GTTTT, and AGGCGG/CCGCCT, which 
accounted for 78.92%, 54.542% 29.012%, 31.422%, 
15.682% and 8.982% of all types, respectively.
This frequency analysis of repeat motifs can be used as a potential source
for designing repeat probes for effective targeting and isolation of
microsatellite repeats from turmeric. Moreover, these probes can be used
for designing informative primers that can be used for genetic diversity
analysis and related studies.

Conclusion
In total, we identified 568 non-redundant hypervariable microsatellites
from EST data source of Curcuma longa using SSR identification tool
SciRoKo. Development of SSR markers from EST‐databases saves both
cost and time, once a sufficient amount of EST sequences is available.
These non‐redundant SSR resources will not only be applied in studies of
genetic variation and linkage mapping but also provide the foundation for
an in‐depth analysis of the characteristics of distribution of genes on
chromosomes and for comparative genomic studies on different Curcuma
species.
