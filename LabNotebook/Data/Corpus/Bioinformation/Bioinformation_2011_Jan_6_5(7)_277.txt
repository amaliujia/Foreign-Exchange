Editorial
Genomics has promised to change the practice of dentistry. Since the 
complete sequencing of the Human Genome, the development of massscale 
research tools in this field, such as DNA microarrays, has greatly 
improved  []. 
Recent studies have employed microarray technology to 
monitor gene expression in periodontal  patients, strain diversity of oral 
microflora implied in periodontitis, and the effect of oral microflora on the 
expression of chemokine genes [–]. Similar studies have been conducted 
also in other diseases, such as oral lichen planus (OLP) 
[].

However, if compared with other areas of medicine, the progresses in oral 
pathology achieved using purely genomic approaches have been overall 
limited  []. Other “-omics” disciplines, such as proteomics and 
metabolomics, should therefore be applied to achieve a more 
comprehensive view of the molecular mechanisms underlying oral 
disorders []. To date, some proteomic studies have been conducted in the 
field of oral pathology, and have led to the identification of risk factors and 
therapeutic targets at a molecular level [,
].

Further advances in the application of proteomics to dental research and 
oral pathology appear in any case  advocated. These include, but are not 
limited to, the identification of other molecules and molecular pathways 
involved in oral diseases, the limitation of the inflammatory response after 
dental procedures, and the possible programming of cellular and tissue 
response upon the placement of restorative materials or implants.

This special issue of Bioinformation  presents some new insights in this 
challenging and stimulating field, authored by some leading scientists 
working in this area.
