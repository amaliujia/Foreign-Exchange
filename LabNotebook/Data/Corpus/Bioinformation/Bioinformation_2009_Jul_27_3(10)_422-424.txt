Background
Due to the development of advanced technologies and highly
validated research methodologies, many new genes have
been identified whose roles in cancer have also been
elucidated. The mysteries of cancer mechanism are being
uncovered and the secrets disclosed have to be maintained as
a comprehensive collection in order to gain access to
unrevealed facts. The genetic abnormalities associated with
cancer seem to be multifaceted in nature. The correlation of
facts about different types of cancer and the genes involved
in each type gives deeper insights into the disease mechanism
which leads to new ventures aimed at more promising
treatments. According to American Cancer Society, 7.6
million people died of cancer in the world during the year
2007 []. There are about 4,700 cancer causing genes have
been identified []. The feasibility of better cancer treatments
for all cancer types based on a single reference database has
not been developed yet, though there are databases available
to provide information on the cancer genes. Although there
are databases specifically meant for specific cancer types, no
comprehensive database is available as an all inclusive
source of information on genes specific for different types of
cancer. To address these challenges, we have created a cancer
gene database (CanGeneBase) which caters researchers with
the comprehensive valuable information aimed at fostering
discoveries in the field of oncology and to relate all the gene
information pertaining to various types of cancers. There are
about 200 types of cancers and its information are available
across the published literature [â€“], the current release of
CanGeneBase focuses on more specific cancer types that are
considered to be the most fatal form. Additionally, we would
be updating the gene information regularly to include new
findings so that the researchers could remain well equipped
with the information using CanGeneBase.

Methodology
Database construction
The data in CanGeneBase were collected from various
reputed journals and databases such as Entrez [], Swiss-Prot
[] and DrugBank []. Molinspiration, a cheminformatics
software suite requires either drug structure or SMILES
notation to calculate molecular descriptors for a given drug
molecule. The SMILES notations were obtained from
DrugBank [] and PubChem [] and submitted to the
Molinspiration property calculation web interface. For drug
entries without the SMILES notation, the two dimensional
structures were drawn in ACD ChemSketch [] and the
SMILES notations were generated by using ChemSketch
toolbox. The database was constructed using MySQL, a
powerful open source SQL based database package. The
database interface was made using PHP integrated with
HTML through Apache web server to produce a user-friendly
interface.

Features of CanGeneBase
The CanGeneBase database provides user-friendly
accessibility with the help of search options using the gene
symbol as an entity or using specific cancer type. This search
facilitates to retrieve information about the genes related to
queried cancer type. The gene search provides a list of about
33 unique parameters which includes the Gene Symbol, Gene
Name, Aliases, Gene type, Description, DNA Size,
Chromosomal location, Transcripts, Isoforms, Organism,
Taxonomy, Journal, Title, Author, Post Translational
Modifications, Disorders, Drugs, HIV-1 Protein Interactions,
Protein Motifs / Domains / Families, Functions, Signalling Pathways and Tissue Specificity. Besides that, each entry
provides links to Entrez Gene, HomoloGene, PubMed, SNP,
Probe, OMIM [], Ensembl [], PharmGKB [],
Genecards [], GenBank [] and Swiss-Prot [] to gain
more knowledge about the cancer gene. It also provides
details of the drugs, targeting the genes with its three
dimensional structure including molecular descriptors with
its external link to PubChem [] and KEGG []. These
capabilities aid in retrieving information about the particular
gene including list of drugs available and other properties of
the gene on a single platform.

User-friendly interface
The homepage of the CanGeneBase () displays
options for selection of gene by gene symbol, selection of
drug by drug names and selection of any particular type of
cancer from the list of various types. The user can access the
required information by following any of the three selections.
The selection of a gene directed to gene information page,
where 33 important parameters are listed with links to
various repositories. The selection of cancer type lists all of
genes associated with the particular cancer and each being
linked to the gene information page. The drug selection
connects to a page where the molecular descriptors of the
drug chosen can be accessed with a link to download the
three dimensional structure of the drug.

Caveats and future development
Not all genes published in literature are included in the
current release. The database would be validated further and
updated periodically so as to provide complete and more
authentic information.

Conclusion
The current release of CanGeneBase seeks to provide
valuable gene and drug information on the major types of
cancer. The service intended to be rendered by the current
release would be very useful resource for the scientific
community in developing more targeted treatments for this
multifaceted cancer disease. The unique advantage of
CanGeneBase is that it provides flexible search criteria that
enable the user to query the database with either the gene or
the drug identities. Besides the molecular descriptors of drugs
for 12 different types of cancer, more than 6270 unique
features of gene have been made available in this current
version.
