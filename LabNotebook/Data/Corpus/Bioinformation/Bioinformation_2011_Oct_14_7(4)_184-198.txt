Background:
DNA is constantly damaged due to intrinsic and extrinsic
genotoxic agents including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
ionizing radiation. It is estimated that as many as 103­105 base
lesions are endogenously induced per day in a mammalian
genome [,
] 
which include oxidized bases, single-strand
breaks (SSBs) and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. These
lesions are often cytotoxic and mutagenic []. Hence their repair
is imperative for maintaining genome integrity. The base
excision repair (BER) pathway is the primary process for
repairing AP sites in which AP endonuclease (APE1) has the
central role []. APE1 hydrolyzes the phosphodiester backbone
of the DNA 5' to the AP site and generates 3'­OH and 5'­
deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) that has to be removed before gap
filling repair synthesis by a DNA polymerase followed by
ligation of the nick by a DNA ligase [].

The structure and mechanism of APE1 has been studied
extensively [], and there are nine crystal structures available in
the PDB-databank (, see supplemetray material).
Mundle et al. [] 
showed that the Mg2+­assisted cleavage is a
one-step (concerted) reaction. One crystal structure of APE1 and
product DNA (1DE9) has a single Mn2+ metal ion 
[] at a
position called the A site. The Mn2+ in this crystal structure is
coordinated by the carboxyl group of E96. Five more crystal
structures without substrate or product DNA have also one
metal ion each (Sm3+, Pb2+, and Mg2+) at the A site 
[–] (
, see supplemetray material). Another crystal structure of free
APE1 shows two non-catalytic metal Pb2+ ions at positions
defined as A and B site []. 
The B site Pb2+ is close to residue
D210 which is essential for the endonuclease activity [,
].
We showed in an earlier Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation
study the existence of two low potential energy sites for a single
Mg2+ in pre-cleavage complexes of AP site-containing DNA
substrate and APE1 []. These two sites were close to the Aand
B sites. In that study we also proposed the “moving metal”
mechanism []. 
It is essentially the same single Mg2+ ion
mechanism as proposed by Mol et al. 
[]. The difference was the
location of the Mg2+ in the pre-cleavage state. In the simulation
study with the APE1-substrate DNA complex in the precleavage
state, the Mg2+ ion was held most stably at the B site. It
then moved to the A site after cleavage of the substrate DNA.
Similar mechanisms involving movement of a catalytic metal
ion have been suggested for other enzymes, such as for E. coli
ribonuclease [] and restriction endonucleases 
[]. On the
other hand, cleavage reaction with two metal ions proposed by
Beernink et al. [] 
assumes that the site B metal activates a
coordinating water molecule to produce the OH- for the
nucleophilic attack. The second metal at the site A would then
stabilize the leaving 3' end of the product.

In a recent solid state NMR study of APE1 the authors observed
in the first part (APE1 without the substrate DNA) two Mg2+
ion signals []. They also found in the second part (in the
presence of substrate DNA) of that study that both the E96Q
mutant (an A-site mutant) and the double mutant E96Q/D210N
had equivalent Mg2+ binding, i.e. the difference spectrum for
these two mutants was null. Their interpretation of this was that
neither mutant was capable of binding Mg2+, and that there was
no second binding site (B site) for Mg2+ in the active site. In the
present study, we have confirmed that, as with the E96A
mutant we had examined previously [], had endonuclease
activity in presence of Mg2+. To explore the nature of the
binding sites, we carried out MD simulations with Mg2+ ion(s)
placed at the A­, B or A+ B sites in pre-cleavage substrate DNA
complexes of WT APE1, and its E96Q and E96Q/D210N
(named ED) mutants. These simulations showed that Mg2+ at
the A-site destabilizes the substrate DNA, while Mg2+ at B or
A+B site leaves the substrate DNA at the position observed in
the crystal structure (1DE8) of Mol et al. 
[].

Methodology:
Construction of WT and E96Q Mutant APE1 Polypeptides:
The coding sequence for full-length human APE1 was inserted
in the pET15b vector (Novagen) at NdeI/XhoI sites for
expression of APE1 in E. coli. The source of the WT APE1 cDNA
was described earlier []. The point mutation at residue 96
from glutamic acid to glutamine (E96Q) we created by using a
site-directed mutagenesis kit and following the manufacturer's
guidelines (QuickChange II XL, Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA). Briefly, APE1 cDNA was used as the template
in PCR for generating the E96Q mutation with forward (5'
ccagatatactgtgccttcaacagaccaaatgttcagag 3') and reverse (3'
ggtctatatgacacggaagttgtctggtttacaagtctc 5') primers that were
designed with the help of “The QuikChange® Primer Design
Program” (available at 
http://www.genomics.agilent.com).
The DNA sequences of the WT and mutant E96Q APE1 cDNA
were confirmed in UTMB's Recombinant DNA Laboratory
(RDL).

Expression and Purification of WT APE1 and E96Q Polypeptides:
The WT APE1 and E96Q mutant proteins were purified as
previously described [,
] with slight modifications. The
proteins possessing a C-terminal His6-tag were purified via
immobilized metal affinity and ion-exchange chromatography.
Briefly, the E. coli BL21 (DE3)/RIPL cells were transformed with
the pET15b-derivatives and the bacterial culture (1L in LB
broth) were grown to an OD600 of 0.6. Then the APE1 protein
was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) at 16 °C for 14-16 h. The cells were then resuspended in a
lysis/binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and
0.5 M NaCl, sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatants were
loaded on a 3 ml column of Ni-NTA (Qiagen). After washing
the column with 18 ml lysis/binding buffer and then with the
same buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, the proteins were
eluted with 10 ml lysis buffer containing 200 mM imidazole,
and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiotreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. The
histidine tag was removed from the proteins after overnight
incubation (16 h) with thrombin at 4 °C, and APE1 fractions
were further purified to homogeneity using HiTrap SP HP
column by ion-exchange chromatography using the LCC-500
PLUS (Pharmacia). The final fractions were dialyzed against 20
mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT,
and 50% glycerol, and stored at ­20 °C.

AP-Endonuclease Activity and EMSA:
A 43-mer oligo nucleotide duplex containing tetrahydrofuran
(THF) at position 31 in the sequence 5'
ATCTGATTCCCCATCTCCTCAGTTTCACTXCTGCACCGCA
TG 3' (X: THF) was purchased from Midland Inc. (USA) and
prepared as described previously [,
,
]. The oligo was 5'-
end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase
(PNKP). After annealing to the complementary strand with C
opposite THF, the duplex oligo was purified by gel filtration
column (Clontech, Chroma Spin TE 10).

Duplex THF-containing oligo was incubated with recombinant
WT APE1 (0.1 nM) at 37 °C (3 min and 30 min) or E96Q mutant
(0.1 or 1.0 nM) at 37 °C for 30 min in a 15 µl reaction mixture
containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 50 mM KCl, with MgCl2 (2,
5, and 10 mM) or without, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA and 100
µg/ml bovine serum albumin. After stopping the reaction by
adding 10 µl 80% formamide/40 mM NaOH containing 0.05%
xylene cyanol, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min and
cooling on ice, the samples were analyzed by denaturing gel
electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide containing 8 M urea to
separate the substrate DNA from the cleaved product. Gels
were then analyzed with a phosphorescence detection system
(Storm, Molecular Dynamics).

The radiolabel THF oligo (about 25 pM) was incubated with 0.1
nM WT or E96Q mutant APE1 in the absence or presence of
Mg2+, and the protein-DNA complexes were analyzed in the
EMSA-binding buffer containing 40 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl,
and 1 mM DTT for 15 min at 37 °C followed by electrophoresis
in non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3.3 mM sodium acetate and 1 mM EDTA at 4
°C for 1 h at 100 V and the radioactivity in the gels were
analyzed as described [,
].

MD Simulation:
All MD simulations were performed using programs from the
AMBER9 suite []. The parameters were NPT ensemble (P = 1
bar and T = 315 K) with periodic boundary conditions and ff03
force field parameters []. We constructed models for the APE1
complexed with AP site-containing oligonucleotide and Mg2+
from conformations that we had generated in aforementioned
MD simulation study []. In that study, we used a systematic
grid search to determine low potential energy binding sites for
one Mg2+ ion in APE1. These low potential energy sites were
clustered at the A and B sites. For the current simulations with
Mg2+ at the A or B site, we used the same A and B site low
potential energy conformations. In the simulations with two
Mg2+ ions, we started with the A site lowest potential energy
conformation and superimposed on this the B site position for
the second Mg2+. We generated single E96Q and double ED
APE1 mutants by deleting first the side chain oxygen atoms at
positions 96 and 210. Then we added the missing oxygen and
NH2 atoms for these positions using the XLEAP module of the
AMBER9 package. Same module was also used to add Na+ ions
to achieve electrostatic neutrality. Next, we soaked the
complexes in TIP3 water boxes [] large enough to ensure that
each box wall was at least 10 Å away from any complex atom.

After constructing the complexes of APE1, its AP site containing
11-mer oligo substrate, cofactor Mg2+ and the water box, we
first energy-minimized the complexes over 2000 steps and then
continued with MD simulation over 1 ns for single Mg2+ (A or B
site) and 2 ns for two Mg2+ (A+B) complexes. Finally, the
recorded trajectories were analyzed with PTRAJ from the
AMBER package and the snapshots were visualized with the
program MOLMOL [].

Results:
WT and E96Q Mutant APE1 polypeptides have endonuclease activity in the presence of Mg2+
WT APE1 and the E96Q mutant proteins purified to near
homogeneity () were tested for Mg2+ at the active site
by measuring AP endonuclease activity. We used a 43-mer
duplex oligo containing THF at position 31 in the standard
assay buffer containing 2 mM Mg2+ as described in the
Methods. While no activity was observed with 0.1 nM E96Q
mutant, increasing the concentration by 10 times (1.0 nM) in the
presence of 2 mM Mg2+ cleaved the substrate after 30 min
incubation (). Such Mg2+-dependent cleavage activity
in the E96Q mutant was confirmed using two independent
preparations of the mutant protein. We therefore concluded
that the E96Q APE1 mutant is indeed capable of binding Mg2+.
Both WT and E96Q mutant APE1 were able to bind the THF
oligo in the absence of Mg2+. Addition of Mg2+ activated the WT
enzyme resulting in the loss of the oligo bound APE1 complex.
In contrast, the E96Q mutant APE1 remained bound to the THF
oligo () presumably because of its slow turnover
(). These results are consistent with previous results
[,
,
,
] which showed that the E96 mutants had less
activity than the WT enzyme but retained Mg2+-dependence for
its activity. The highest endonuclease activity for the E96Q
mutant was observed at 5 mM Mg2+ () which was
comparable to 8 mM Mg2+ needed for optimum activity of the
E96A mutant we had observed earlier. Also, consistent with the
previous study, higher Mg2+ concentration inhibited AP sitecleavage
activity [].

Mg2+ bound at the A site destabilizes substrate DNA:
In all three simulations of WT, E96Q and ED APE1 with the
Mg2+ bound at the A site, the substrate DNA shifted
significantly from its starting position ( and 
). Placing
a Mg2+ at the A site interfered with the H-bond chain D283-
H309-AP phosphate oxygen (yellow dotted line in -

and ), preventing the H-bond between H309 and the AP
phosphate oxygen that is essential for substrate binding and
cleavage, as indicated by 13 fold higher Km of the H309N
mutant than of WT enzyme [,
].

The final substrate DNA binding site was different for each
complex in these simulations with Mg2+ at the A site (
and . In agreement with the crystal structure of the
product-APE1- Mg2+ complex (PDB-code 1DE9), Mg2+ in the
pre-cleavage DNA-APE1- Mg2+ complex was coordinated by
E/Q96 side chains. In WT APE1 simulation, Mg2+ was
hexagonally coordinated by both E96 side chain oxygens, one
oxygen each from D308, D70, AP phosphate and a water
molecule. The residues D308 and D70 are among the conserved
residues in APE1 and related sequences [,
]. Similarly, in
E96Q and ED mutant simulations, Mg2+ was coordinated by
both side chain oxygens of D308, and one oxygen each of Q96
(instead of E96), D70, AP phosphate and a water molecule.
However, in the 1 ns WT simulation, the AP site P-atom
position was 4.1 Å away from its crystal structure (1DE9)
position with the product and Mg2+ ion 
(, see
supplementary material). This distance between the crystal
structure of the substrate-DNA complex (1DE8) and the WT
simulation was even larger (4.8 Å). Same distance of the AP site
P-atoms between the two crystal structures [] (1DE9 and 1DE8)
is 1.0 Å. In agreement with this we showed in a previous study
[], that 
Mg2+ bound at the B site had pulled the substrate
DNA by 1.0 Å toward D210.

Mg2+ ion at the B site leaves the pre-cleavage 
substrate DNA close to the position observed in the crystal structure
Unlike for the A site simulations, placing the Mg2+ at the B site
left the substrate DNA close to its starting crystal structure
position (1DE8). In the simulations of WT, E96Q and ED
proteins, the B site Mg2+ did not shift the AP site 
(
and ), 
and the final position of the AP site in all three simulations
were very close to one another (
and ). The Hbond
chain D283-H309-AP site phosphate oxygen was intact in
all three simulations (, 
 and 
,
). Furthermore, in
contrast to the A site simulations, placing the Mg2+ at the B site
kept the AP site P-atom close to the corresponding crystal
structure P-atoms in the product plus Mn2+ (1DE9) and
substrate (1DE8) containing crystal structures (0.9 Å and 1.8 Å).

The B site Mg2+, contrary to the assumption of Lipton et al. 
[]
and others that E96 is only a A site ligand and therefore would
coordinate only the A site metal ion, was coordinated also by
the E/Q96 side chains. Similar behavior we had observed in
earlier simulations [,
]. We always found that the E96 side
chain coordinated the Mg2+ ion, and followed the movement of
the Mg2+ ion from the B to the A site. During the migration of
the Mg2+ from the B to the A site the OE2 atom on E96 needed
to move only 2.07 Å.  and 
 show the active site and
coordination of the B site Mg2+ after 1 ns WT simulation. Here
and in the other two B site simulations the Mg2+ was
hexagonally coordinated by the side chains of E96, N212, D210
(both side chain oxygens), AP phosphate oxygen and a water
molecule.

AP phosphate oxygens bridge A and B site bound Mg2+ ions
In the MD-simulations with two Mg2+ ions bound at the A and
B site, the Mg2+ ions were bridged by the AP site phosphate
oxygens. Additionally, E96 in the WT simulation also bridged
the two Mg2+ ions (, 
and ,
). This behavior was
different from what we observed in earlier simulations []
where we started with two Mg2+ ions at the Pb2+position in
APE1’s crystal structure 1E9N []. In the current simulations,
we started with two grid search positions (low potential energy
positions) []. Earlier, the two Mg2+ ions moved away from
each other [], while in these simulations they moved closer.
They were stabilized by phosphate oxygens of the AP site and
additionally by the E96 carboxyl group in WT APE1 simulation
(). In the E96Q and ED APE1 simulations, the side
chain oxygen of Q96 coordinated only the B site Mg2+ and could
not bridge both Mg2+ ions. Nevertheless, the H-bond chain
D283-H309-AP site phosphate oxygen was intact (yellow dotted
lines in ,  
and , 
, 
). The distances between
the AP site P-atom positions from the WT simulation with two
Mg2+ (at sites A+B) to the corresponding P-atom positions in the
crystal structures (1DE8: substrate alone and 1DE9: product
plus Mn2+) were 2.1 Å and 1.2 Å. These distances were larger
than the distances from the WT APE1 simulation with one Mg2+
ion bound at the B site to the same crystal structures (1.8 Å and
0.9 Å) (, see supplementary material).

Discussion:
As noted in the introduction, the exact stoichiometry of the
metal ion in the APE1 cleavage reaction is still being debated
because that could only be inferred from indirect
measurements. The most reliable way to determine the location
of Mg2+ during catalysis is by analysis of the active site of
crystal structures [–
]. As we previously discussed, such data
for APE1 indicate two different binding sites for Mg2+ (A and B
site). Although solid-state 25Mg NMR has been proposed as a
way to quantitate the number of metal ions bound, this method
is still problematic, because of background due to nonspecific
Mg2+ binding. While Lipton et al. 
[] identified, in the first part
of their study, two different Mg2+ signals originating from Mg2+
bound in the active site of free APE1 (no substrate-bound), they
could not establish the positions for these two Mg2+ ions. Our
previously described grid search data indicated that there were
two, low potential energy positions for Mg2+ ions. These were
close to the positions of metal ions in the crystal structures 
[].
In our current MD-simulations with two Mg2+ ions at the A and
B site the APE1-substrate-Mg2+ ions complex was also stable.
Therefore, the two different Mg2+ signals from the solid state
NMR study are consistent with both (1DE8 and 1DE9) crystal
structures, our “moving metal” moel and the two Mg2+ complex
presented in this study. However, the rejection of the B site in
the second part of the solid state NMR study 
[] Lipton et al. is
not justified. Logical consequence of the argumentation of
Lipton et al. would be that neither the ED nor E96Q mutant
would be able to bind any Mg2+ at the active site. In this study
we showed qualitative experimental confirmation of earlier
results from Erzberger et al. 
[], Nguyen et al. 
[] and Chou et
al. [], 
that the E96Q mutant has Mg2+-dependent (low but
detectable) endonuclease activity. Although these experiments
did not allow the determination of the specific location of the
Mg2+ (A or B site) on APE1, it is safe to conclude that Mg2+ was
bound at the active site. In MD simulations for this study we
showed that Mg2+ binding at the A site alone is very unlikely.
Assuming that the ion does not move, this Mg2+ position would
be consistent with the crystal structure of the APE1-cleaved
DNA-Mn2+ complex (1DE9). However, the distance between the
Mn2+ and D210 in this crystal structure is larger than 5.5 Å.
Therefore, this crystal structure cannot explain the complete
loss of endonuclease activity in D210 mutants [,
]. This is
also the weakness of the one Mg2+ mechanism that shows the
Mg2+ bound at the A site []. Additionally, placing only one
Mg2+ at the A site destabilized the substrate in the MD
simulations. It also interfered with the H-bond chain D283-
H309-AP site, which is critical for substrate binding 
[,
].
Placing the Mg2+ at the B site on the other hand kept the
substrate DNA stable at its crystal structure position and the Hbond
chain D283-H309-AP site phosphate intact. The B site
Mg2+ was coordinated by D210, which explains the essential
role of D210 for the endonuclease activity. Further, B site Mg2+
shifted the AP site of the substrate closer to D210 and closer to
the AP site position in the crystal structure with the product
(1DE9). Assuming that Mg2+ is bound at the B site prior to
cleavage, it has to move to the A site after cleavage in order to
be consistent with the APE1-product-Mn2+ crystal structure
(1DE9). This is essentially our “moving metal” mechanism 
[]
based on MD simulations. As shown in  
and , the B
site Mg2+ was coordinated pre-cleavage by E96, D210, N212,
AP-phosphate and a water molecule. In our mechanism D210
accepts the proton during the activation process of the Mg2+
bound water molecule to create the nucleophile OH-. In that
process the acquired proton weakens the D210-Mg2+ interaction
and repels the Mg2+ that then moves to the A site. N212 has
been shown to be involved in substrate binding 
[], which
could also be explained in our model. N212 coordinated the
Mg2+ and forms a H-bond with the substrate. E96 is located
between the A and B site enabling it to coordinate the Mg2+ at
both sites. In all simulations we observed that it was
coordinating a Mg2+ independent of where the Mg2+ was
located. In our current MD-simulations with two Mg2+ ions at
the A+B site the important H-bond chain D283-H309-AP site
also remained intact. The AP site phosphate oxygens and the
E96 side chain oxygens bridged the Mg2+ ions 
() and
left the substrate relatively stable. However, the AP site
positions in the single B site Mg2+ simulations were closer to the
crystal structure positions (1DE8 and 1DE9) than the AP site
position in the simulations with two Mg2+ ions at the A+B sites.
Additionally, in the crystal structure with the product bound
(1DE9), there is only one Mn2+ ion. In our MD-simulations we
started with conformations close to the global minimum,
namely the crystal structure 1DE8. Therefore, in general one
would expect small conformational changes that represent only
local rearrangements and fluctuations around this minimum.
We saw this kind of fluctuations with the B and A+B site
simulations. The A site simulation on the other hand showed
even at the end of our relatively short simulation time large
changes compared with the initial conformation. This indicates
that placing one Mg2+ ion at A site did change the energy
landscape drastically. Accordingly, longer simulation would
show only even larger conformational changes. Finally, we
predict that solving the crystallographic structure of Mg2+
bound to the D210N mutant will unequivocally establish the
pre-cleavage position and number of Mg2+ ion(s). Because the
D210N mutation renders APE1 totally inactive, the Mg2+ ion(s)
would be trapped in their pre-cleavage position(s), which
should be evident in the protein structure.
