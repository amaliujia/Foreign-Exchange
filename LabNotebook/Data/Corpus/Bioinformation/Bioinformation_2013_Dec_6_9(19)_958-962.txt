Background
The β-glucan, a homo-polysaccharide of glucose molecule
linked by the glycoside bond forms the major constituents of
the cell wall of higher plant family Poaceae. This group of
carbohydrates is made up of approximately 1,200 glucose units,
linked through β-1,3-1,4 glycosidic bonds and β-1,3 linkage
account for 25-30%. Enzymatic degradation of β-1,3-1,4-glucans
is activated by three different endogenous glycosyl hydrolases:
1,4-β-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 4), 1,3- β-Dglucan
3-glucanohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 39) and 1,3-1,4-β-D 4-
glucanohydrolase (EC 3. 2. 1. 73). Among endo-glycosidases,
the 1,3-1,4- β-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (β-1,3-1,4-glucanase
or lichenase) is reported to be most active. The β-1,4-glucosidic
bonds are present conterminous to the β-1,3 linkages of
lichenan or barley β-glucan and yield the final products such as
cellobiosyltriose and cellotriosyltetrose []. The β-1,3-1,4-
glucanase has attracted commercial interest due to its
importance in beer fermentation and poultry feed formulations.
The β-glucans cause several industrial processing problems
during malting. They reduced the barley seed extract, the
amount of wort separation, formation of brumous condition
and viscous precipitates in beer. Now a days, malt enzymes are
replaced by β-1,3-1,4-glucanase to reduce these problems 
[]. In
order to increase the feed conversion ratio (FCR) of nonruminal
animals β-1,3-1,4-glucanase is added as a supplement.
In poultry industries, the water-soluble non-starch
polysaccharide acts as an anti-nutritional agent. Poultry feed
mixed with β-1,3-1,4-glucanase and xylanase enzymes enhances
the weight gain, feed intake and the digestibility of nitrogen
(+5.6%) and lipids (+6.2%) and also reduces the sticky
droppings which is a major sanitary problems.

The β-1,3-1,4-glucanase genes have been reported from
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. While microbial enzymes are
classified as members of glycosyl hydrolase family 16 plant
enzymes are classified as glycosyl family 17 []. Genes encoding
b-1,3-1,4-glucanase have been delineated and characterized
from the members of Bacillaceae family and non-Bacillus bacteria
such as Clostridium thermocellum, Streptococcus bovis, Fibrobacter
succinogenes and Paenibacillus sp.

The b-1,3-1,4-glucanase enzymes produced by Bacillus and non-
Bacillus sp. have shown high degree of sequence homology in
their catalytic domains and proteins shared a conserved amino
acid sequence “EIDIEF” []. Presence of two glutamic acid
residues in the motif plays a key role in hydrolytic activity.
Bacterial β-1,3-1,4-glucanases contains calcium ion binding sites
in its structure []. Glycoside hydrolases such as β-1,3-1,4-
glucanases, hemicellulases are sensitively depends upon the
calcium ions for their stability. The removal of calcium ions
generally destabilize the thermostability of enzymes. Even
though the in vitro effects of calcium ions have been studied, in
silico analyses have not been studied. Present investigation
reports the isolation, cloning, expression, purification,
characterization and molecular dynamics simulation of a novel
recombinant enzyme from B. subtilis SU40.

Methodology
Isolation and identification of bacteria:
Soil sample was collected from agricultural field located at
Puducherry. Serially diluted soil suspension (10-10 - 100 µl) were
spread-plated onto barley glucan congo red agar medium and
incubated at 30°C for 2 days. Single colonies that produce clear
zones were picked up and used for further study. Universal
primers, fD1 (5΄-GAG TTT GAT CCT GGC TCA-3΄) and rP2 (5΄-
ACG GCT ACC TTG TTA CGA CTT-3΄) were used to amplify
16S rRNA as described [] and sequenced. The nucleotide
sequence has been deposited at Genbank with an accession
number HQ834723.

Delineation, cloning and heterologous expression of SU40-glu gene:
Gene-specific primers, BSF (5΄-ACA ACG GAATTC ATG CAA
ACA GGT GGA TCG TTT TTT G-3΄) and BSR (5΄-ATA GTT TA
GCGGCCGC TTA TTT TTT TGT ATA GCG CAC CCA G-3΄)
were used [] to amplify the b-1,3-1,4 glucanase gene. The
SU40-glu gene was sequenced and deposited in Genbank with
an accession number HQ834722. The SU40-glu gene was cloned
into pET 28 a+ vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3) using 1 mM IPTG.

Purification of recombinant b-1,3-1,4 glucanase:
Recombinant protein was purified as described earlier 
[].
Purification was achieved by HIS-Select nickel affinity gel
(Sigma). Sodium dodecyl sulfate – polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to analyze the eluted
fractions.

Characterization of recombinant b-1,3-1,4 glucanase enzyme:
Optimum temperature was identified by performing standard
assays at various temperatures ranged from 30 to 90°C and the
residual activity was measured using dinitrosalicylic method. In
order to determine the effects of metal ions, the enzyme
solution was incubated in the assay buffer containing 10 mM of
Ca2+, Mn2+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ metal ions and the enzyme
activity was measured. The effect of calcium ion concentration
on the recombinant glucanase was studied. Various
concentration of Ca2+ (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mM) to the enzyme and
enzyme activity was measured as described earlier. Effect on
the thermostability was determined by incubating the enzyme
with optimum concentration of Ca2+ ions at various
temperatures ranged from 30 to 90°C.

Molecular modelling:
The DNA nucleotide sequence was translated into protein
sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of b-1,3-1,4
glucanase was analyzed with the Expert Protein Analysis
System (http://expasy.org/). Translated protein sequence was
used as an input for protein Basic Local Search Alignment Tool
(BLAST) to identify the best protein template for homology
model building. The tertiary structure was modeled using
Modeler9v9 and 1GBG as a template. Best model was selected
based on the Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE) score
and further verified using SAVeS server [] for Procheck,
ERRAT and Verify3D. Verified model was further scrutinized
for the protein stability with and without Ca ion using
Molecular Dynamics Study.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations:
A 5000 ps molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the β-1,3-1,4
glucanase was carried out with GROMACS4.5. package 
[]
using the GROMOS9643a1 force field. The initial conformation
was taken from the one with binding energy closest to
experimental binding energy and binding constant. The
topology parameters of β-1,3-1,4 glucanase were created by
using Gromacs program. Then the protein was immersed in a
cubic box (7.335×6.135×8.119 nm) of extended simple point
charge (SPC) water molecules. The solvated system was
neutralized by adding chlorine ions in the simulation box. To
release conflicting contacts, energy minimization was
performed using the steepest descent method of 1000 steps,
followed by the conjugate gradient method for 1000 steps. The
MD simulation studies consist of equilibration and production
phases. Finally, the full system was subjected to 5000 ps MD at
300 K temperature and 1 bar pressure [,
].

Results &amp; Discussion
Isolation and identification of bacteria:
Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence homology and molecular
phylogenetic tree analysis, the new glucanolytic bacterial strain
SU40 was identified as Bacillus subtilis.

Delineation, Characterization of SU40-glu gene:
Using gene-specific primers the putative SU40-glu gene (650
bp) was delineated and sequenced. BLAST search and
phylogenetic tree analysis of amino acid sequence showed 97%
homology with the b-1,3-1,4 glucanase enzyme (AAO18342) of
B. licheniformis. The ORF containing 650 bp encodes 214 amino
acids with a theoretical molecular mass and pI of 24.2 kDa, 5.78
respectively. The conserved motif “EIDIEF” of family GH-16
was found.

Purification of recombinant b-1,3-1,4 glucanase:
Purified enzyme was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (). The
molecular weight was determined as 24 kDa which is similar
with the theoretically calculated molecular weight. The yield of
purified enzyme was 44.88% with 37.85 U/mg of specific
activity.

Characterization of recombinant b-1,3-1,4 glucanase enzyme:
Various substrates such as β-glucan, lichenan, laminarin,
carboxymethylcellulose, PNPG and xylan were used to
determine the substrate specificity. Maximum activity was
observed against 0.5% β-glucan (34.07 U/ml) followed by
lichenan (26.48 U/ml). The recombinant enzyme also showed
activity against 0.5% xylan (8.14 U/ml). Hence, SU40-glu acts as
a bi-functional enzyme with single catalytic domain. The
optimum temperature was found to be 60°C. Around 54% of
the total activity was remained after incubating the enzyme
upto 85°C for 60 min at pH 8. In the presence of Ca2+ ions the
enzyme activity was slightly increased. Maximum enzyme
activity (142%) of was observed in the presence of 15 mM Ca2+
ions and 25 mM concentration decreased the activity to 86%.
Thermostability of the enzyme was increased upto 65% at 85°C
in the presence of 15 mM Ca2+. Calcium ion has a general
stabilizing effect on Bacillus β-1,3-1,4 glucanases.
Thermostability was highly affected by the removal of the
bound calcium ion. In bacterial β-1,3-1,4 glucanases, N-terminal
loop contributes to the higher thermostability when complexed
with calcium ion. Calcium ion also plays the role in stabilizing
the native protein []. Calcium is bound to the backbone
carbonyl oxygens of Pro9, Gly45, Asp207 and carboxylate
oxygen of Asp207 and two water molecules []. The enzyme
SU40-glu also showed Pro9, Gly45 and Asp207, which may acts
as a binding domain for calcium ion.

Metal ions such as Mn2+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ showed little
or no effect on the enzyme activity. However, the mercury ion
totally inhibited the activity because Hg2+ ion may reacts with
the amino acid cysteine in their side group –SH moiety. The
SU40-glu enzyme showed the presence of four histidine
residues (His130, His145, His166 and His205) and the mercury
ion that may be involved in binding of imidazole ring of
histidine. This altered cysteine and histidine residues on the
protein chain, affect the protein folding in its tertiary structure
and the shape of the active site and thus, inhibits the activity of
the enzyme [].

Molecular modelling:
The template protein (1GBG) and SU40-glu showed 90%
sequence identity and the homology model of SU40-glu were
generated using Modeler9v9 with and without Ca ion (). 
The predicted structure of β-1,3-1,4 glucanase showed one
disulphide bridge between Cys32 and Cys61 residues. The
active site residues were identified as Trp103, Asp104, Ile106,
Ile108 and Glu109 in the β-strand. Binding sites in SU40-glu
were predicted as Phe33, Val91, Ser93, Phe95, Trp106, Glu108,
Asp110, Glu112, Tyr126, Asn185 and Trp187 by CASTp server
(http://sts-fw.bioengr.uic.edu/castp/calculation.php). Earlier
study indicated that Asp107, Glu105 (as nucleophile) and
Glu109 (as acid catalyst) are essential for enzyme activity 
[].
The PROCHECK analysis confirmed the presence of 95.7% of
amino acids in the favored region, 3.8% of amino acids in the
additional allowed region and 0.5% of amino acicds in the
generously allowed region with a Verify3D of 99.08% and
ERRAT value of 80.838. The three-dimensional model of SU40-
glu revealed the presence of all these amino acids in the same
reported positions which may be responsible for the enzyme
activity.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations:
The MD simulation studies of SU40 β-1,3-1,4 glucanases with
and without Ca ions have been performed for 5ns. The protein
shows its stability throughout the simulations period. But in the
absence of Ca, protein energy slightly moves to high with
compare to Ca bound protein complex (). Root Mean
Square Deviation (RMSD) clearly state that there is no dramatic
change in the protein backbone deviation. Marginal fluctuations
difference was noticed during the trajectory period (),
while RMSF graph revealed that in the lack of Ca ion some of
the Ca bound residues and active site residues
[DMFNCTWRAN (31-40), T (45 CA bound residue), SYNKFD
(58-63), W(106), D(193) were fluctuated abnormally ().
Radius of gyration () also suggests that the Ca bound
structure of SU40 Beta 1, 3-1, 4 glucanase is more stable which
supports our experimental results.

Conclusion
The gene encoding β-1,3-1,4-glucanase was delineated from
Bacillus subtilis SU40, cloned into pET 28a+ vector and
overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant
enzyme (24 kDa) was purified to homogeneity. Purified enzyme
exhibited a high catalytic activity and stability to temperature,
pH and metal ions. Experimental analysis suggested that the
presence of Ca ions improved the thermostability of SU40 β-1,3-
1,4 glucanase. Molecular dynamics simulation studies also
revealed that the absence of calcium ion fluctuate the active site
residues which are responsible for thermostability.
