Background
Microarray technology has become a widely used and effective research tool in modern molecular biology. It can produce a snapshot of the expression levels of thousands of genes
simultaneously at a very low cost per data point. However, researchers are often more interested in how biological pathways respond to experimental condition changes rather than in
changes in expression levels of individual genes. The total flux through a pathway can change dramatically through subtle changes in expression levels of genes involved in that pathway. 
[] Thus, the prevalence of microarray technology in the research of complex metabolic disorders makes the problem of
identifying genes with subtle differential expression increasingly important. Unfortunately, the identification of genes with subtle differential expression is challenging due to the huge number of
genes involved, the noisiness of the data, and the very small sample sizes (often not more than 5 observed expression levels per gene and/or per treatment group).

Most approaches for identifying differentially expressed genes may be of limited power because they neither take into account nor capitalize on dependencies among genes. As an alternative,
we propose an adaptive alpha-spending algorithm that takes into account the dependencies of expression levels among genes explicitly by assigning gene-specific significance levels to each
gene. The alpha-spending algorithm is named so because of its similarity with alpha-spending algorithms in interim analysis in clinical trials. [] 
Interim analysis is often carried out at multiple times in a clinical trial for reasons such as checking adherence to the protocol, economic and ethical reasons. Because in interim
analysis the same null-hypothesis is tested multiple times, not correcting for multiple testing will inflate the type 1 error. Multiplicity is controlled in the alpha-spending algorithm by
assigning stage specific significance levels to each stage in the clinical trial such that the sum of stage specific significance levels is equal to the overall significance level,

Discussion
We have proposed an adaptive alpha-spending algorithm for
finding differentially expressed genes in microarray data sets
in which observed dependencies among genes are
incorporated by assigning gene specific significance levels to
each gene. We think this procedure may increase the power in
finding differentially expressed genes. The  is attached

Our simulation study confirms that the alpha-spending algorithm controls the PCER and FDR in many practical situations. Under the complete null, the PCER was controlled
with respect to all genes overall as well as for the group of uncorrelated genes. For the group of correlated genes, the PCER tended to be inflated (). Under the partial null,
the PCER was controlled in all simulation parameter settings and the FDR was controlled in most of the simulation parameter settings (). The observed PCER decreases
for increasing group-size and correlation, but this relationship was not seen in the observed FDR. On average the alpha-spending algorithm improves the power and this power
improvement increased for increasing group size or increasing correlation. The power improvement can be up to 47% for ρ = 0.7 and n = 6 (). However the power
improvement varied substantially across individual simulated data sets. For lower values of ρ and n power decreased for some simulated data sets and this decrease in power was up to
15% for ρ = 0.3 and n = 4 . For n ≥ 6 the alphaspending algorithm seemed to have added value. We also increased the number of genes in the simulation to 2000 for
some cases; the results are very similar to what was obtained for the simulations with 700 genes.

Conclusion
We have proposed an adaptive alpha-spending algorithm for finding differentially expressed genes in microarray data sets in which observed dependencies among genes are incorporated by
assigning gene specific significance levels to each gene. We have shown that the alpha-spending algorithm approximately controls the FWER under the complete null. In a simulation
study we have illustrated that the alpha-spending algorithm controls the PCER and FDR and improves the power when applied to the ordinary t-test under special circumstances within
the two group comparisons with equal group sizes. However, there may be situations in which the PCER is inflated as was shown for the correlated genes under the complete null.

Observed PCER and observed FDR of the alpha-spending algorithm as a function of power of the ordinary t-test for
different correlations ρ = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and different group sizes n = 4, 6,10 for k = 700 . The number of genes in
each simulation was 700 and the nominal alpha levels of 0.05 was used for identifying differential genes. A thin dashed black
line, a solid blue line, and a thick red line refer to a correlation ρ of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, respectively. The group sizes of 4, 6, and
10 are represented by circles, squares, and triangles, respectively. In each simulation parameter setting (ρ , n) the observed
PCER was estimated from 100 simulated data sets

Power improvement of alpha-spending p-values with respect to the ordinary t-test. The results are from the partial null
hypothesis simulations with 20% of the genes differentially expressed and correlated with the same correlation coefficient ρ and
80% of the genes non-differentially expressed and uncorrelated. For k = 700 , the 700 = 7x100 simulated data sets per
plot were obtained by independently generating 100 data sets for each of seven different values of the population mean
differential expression Δ . These seven values of Δ = Δ(1– β ) were obtained such that the corresponding power of the
ordinary t-test in detecting the differentially expressed genes was varied by1– β = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 . For
k = 2000 the 30 simulated data sets correspond to 1– β = 0.5 only. The situation k = 2000 is simulated for
n = 4, 6 but not for n =10
