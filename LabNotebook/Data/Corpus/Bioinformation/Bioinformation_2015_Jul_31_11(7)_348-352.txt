regulator gene. This gene encodes a protein involved in epithelial anion channel. Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-limiting
genetic disorder in Caucasians; it also affects other ethnic groups like the Blacks and the Native Americans. Cystic fibrosis is
considered to be rare among individuals from the Indian subcontinent. We analyzed a total of 29 world׳s populations for cystic
fibrosis on the basis of gene frequency and heterozygosity. Among 29 countries Switzerland revealed the highest gene frequency
and heterozygosity for CF (0.022, 0.043) whereas Japan recorded the lowest values (0.002, 0.004) followed by India (0.004, 0.008).
Our analysis suggests that the prevalence of cystic fibrosis is very low in India.

Background
Genetic disease or disorder is the result of changes, or
mutations, in an individual׳s DNA. Any mutation in the
coding region of a gene may lead to the production of a protein
which is no longer functional. In India, the occurrence of
congenital abnormalities is up to 37.0 per 1000 births and for
live births alone from 9.8 to 21.0 per 1000 [1]. Genetic diseases
can be inherited if the mutation occurs in the germ cell of the
body, as germ cells are involved in passing genetic information
from one generation to next generation or from parents to
offspring. Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disease,
occurs when both the parents have mutated genes. Cystic
fibrosis (CF) is the most common potentially lethal and life
threatening genetic disorder among the white Caucasian
population of Europe, North America and Australia. It
is caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene [2]. In UK approximately 1
in 2500 children are born with CF incidence [3], less common
in African Americans (1 in 15 000) and Asian Americans (1 in
31 000) [4].

The CFTR gene translates a protein which transports sodium
and chloride across cell membranes. Mutation of CFTR gene
leads to too much salt deposit and not enough water within the
cells. As a result, the mucus becomes thick, sticky and salty
instead of sweaty. The thick, sticky mucus builds up in the
respiratory and digestive passage ways, which gives rise to
symptoms of the disease condition. The clinical features
include pancreatic insufficiency, male infertility, meconium
ileus in the newborn, and chronic lung infection with excessive
inflammation, leading to progressive deterioration of lung
function [5]. The loss of lung function is the main cause of
death in CF patients. Most current therapies treat the
symptoms of the disease and have increased the median life
expectancy for individuals with CF to ~39 years [6].

In 1989 the CFTR gene was identified, and located on the
seventh human chromosome at the position 7ql3 [7]. More
than 1,900 mutations have been identified in the CFTR gene
(http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr). The most common
mutation is the ΔF508 that is seen in two thirds of all
cystic fibrosis cases all over the world [8]. It is a threenucleotide
deletion at the 508th codon causing the deletion of a
phenylalanine residue and subsequent defective intracellular
processing of the CFTR protein which is an important chloride
channel [9]. In 1968 it was reported that cystic fibrosis was rare
in India [10]. Recent studies on CF cases indicate that the
disease is far more common in people of Indian origin than
previously thought. CF in the migrant population from the
Indian subcontinent in the USA is 1 in 40 000, and in the UK is
1 in 10 000–12 000 [11]. A study on 955 cord blood samples
suggested a carrier rate of the common mutation DF 508 (DF
508) as 0.4%, and incidence of CF in India is 1 in 40 000 [12],
but its diagnosis often escapes in the majority of cases. In view
of the above facts the present study was undertaken to
estimate the allele frequency of cystic fibrosis gene in Indian
vis-a/-vis 28 other global populations.

Methodology
Data collection:
The data were retrieved from the molecular genetics
epidemiology of cystic fibrosis (MGECF) that were published
by WHO since 1983. Most documents report joint meetings
and workshops organized by WHO in association with various
organizations devoted to CF, including the International Cystic
Fibrosis (Mucoviscidosis) Association (ICFMA) now Cystic
Fibrosis Worldwide, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF), the
European Cystic Fibrosis Thematic Network (ECFTN) and the
European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS). Some data are
collected from the countries of European Union (EU) during
2004.

For the present study we have selected a total of 29
populations of different countries (including India) across
different continents i.e, Europe, Australia, Latin America,
Africa and Asia. The population data of cystic fibrosis were
obtained from the published literature given in Table 1 (see
supplementary material) [13–18].

Estimation of allele frequency:
Assuming dominance model with two alleles for cystic fibrosis
locus, the recessive allele frequency for different populations
was estimated following Hedrick (2005) [19] as

q=[N22N]½


Where, N22 = No. of recessive homozygotes
N = Total individuals

The dominant allele frequency (p) was estimated as

ρ =1− q

If ρ and q are the frequencies of a biallelic gene, then at HardyWeinberg
equilibrium the frequencies of genotypes are given by

p2 + 2pq + q2= 1

Where, p = the frequency of the dominant allele (represented
here by A)
q = the frequency of the recessive allele (represented here by a)
p2= frequency of AA (homozygous dominant) genotype
2pq= frequency of Aa (heterozygous) genotype
q2= frequency of aa (homozygous recessive) genotype

Hardy-Weinberg heterozygosity of a population for a
particular locus with n alleles can be estimated as

HE=1−Σi=1npi2


Where, pi2 = genotype frequency of observed homozygotes. 

Heterozygosity is used as an index of genetic variation in a
locus within a population and provides information about the
occurrence of an allele upon segregation.

Results &amp; Discussion
Genetic study of the allele frequency of loci involved in genetic
disorders plays a very crucial role in formulating research
projects for follow-up detailed study and in identifying the
thrust areas for therapeutic interventions by the governmental
agencies. Based on allele frequency analysis it can be predicted
how frequently the diseased condition will occur in common
population of a country. The population size and incidence of
cystic fibrosis in 29 countries are presented in 
Table 1 (see
supplementary material).

Assuming a digenic model with complete dominance and a
recessive allele governing the cystic fibrosis condition, we
analyzed 29 human populations for estimating the frequencies
of normal/dominant (healthy condition) and recessive
(diseased condition) alleles and the extent of heterozygosity for
cystic fibrosis locus. Heterozygosity is used as an index for
understanding the degree of genetic variation occurring in a
diseased locus. Greater the heterozygosity, greater the chance
of occurrence of the disease as recessive homozygotes upon
Mendelian segregation and recombination in a population.

The gene frequency and heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis in 29
countries is presented in Figure 1. Earlier study on cystic
fibrosis reported it be rare in India [10]. But subsequent studies
reported that cystic fibrosis increases every year in the
population. Keeping this point in mind, we estimated the
frequency of the recessive allele for cystic fibrosis in 29 global
populations including India from the genotypic frequencies.
Our analysis revealed that Japan recorded the lowest allele
frequency and heterozygosity for CF (0.002, 0.004) followed by
India (0.004, 0.008).

The predicted incidence for CF among Asians in the United
Kingdom (Indians/ Pakistani) is 1 in 10000 [20] and 1 in 40000
in the USA [11]. But in India, the CF incidence is reported to be
1 in every 40000 to 100000 live births [21]. Switzerland (0.022,
0.043), Italy (0.020, 0.040) and Australia (0.020, 0.039) record
relatively higher frequency of the recessive allele and
heterozygosity for CF Table 2 (see supplementary material). It
is evident from our analysis that Asian countries showed lower
frequencies of the CF recessive allele compared to European
countries like Switzerland and Italy.

Literature on the study of CF in Middle East countries is
scanty. Our analysis revealed that the Middle East countries
namely UAE (0.008, 0.016) and Bahrain (0.013, 0.026) had
intermediate CF recessive allele frequency and heterozygosity.
The global distribution pattern of the CF recessive allele
frequency and heterozygosity (Figure 1) provides a clue that
during the process of migration of human population from
Africa to other continents, the frequency of CF recessive allele
might have increased in the colder regions of the world due to
natural selection. Till date there is no detailed study on the
genetic and clinical profile of cystic fibrosis among Indian
children [22]. Thus, an in-depth study on CF across the global 
populations at molecular level could provide further insights
in understanding the occurrence of CF cases across different
populations all over the globe.

Conclusion
The present study revealed that the recessive allele frequency
and heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis are low in India i.e., 0.004
and 0.008, respectively. But Japan recorded the lowest values
for allele frequency and heterozygosity (i.e. 0.002, 0.004)
whereas Switzerland had the highest recessive allele frequency
and heterozygosity (i.e. 0.022, 0.043) for cystic fibrosis. India
runs a relatively low risk for cystic fibrosis among twenty-nine
global populations. Further research at molecular level may be
initiated to understand the factors responsible for increased
frequency of cystic fibrosis in European countries and
decreased frequency in Asian countries.
