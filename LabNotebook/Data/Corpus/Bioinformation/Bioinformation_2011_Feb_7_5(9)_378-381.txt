Background
Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don, commonly known as periwinkle, of the 
family Apocynaceae is an ornamental plant with great medicinal value. 
The genus Catharanthus includes seven species besides C. roseus namely 
C. coriaceus, C. lanceus, C longifoleus, C ovalis, C pussilus, C scitulus
and  C trichophyllus.   C pussilus is endemic to India while the rest are 
abundantly present in Madagascar.  Catharanthus roseus  possesses a 
suitable genetic system, as it is biannual, seed cyclable, diploid (2n=16) 
and amenable to controlled pollination and Micropropagation  [,
]. As 
such, various genetic, proteomic and biotechnological studies is in progress 
in Catharanthus thereby making it a highly investigative plant species. An 
important breeding objective for the improvement of C. roseus is the 
development of molecular markers. Variation at DNA level is the key to 
modern studies and several DNA marker systems has been developed 
including restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random 
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeats 
(ISSR), simple sequence repeats (SSR), amplified fragment length 
polymorphism (AFLP) and their variants in the recent times to analyze 
gross and specific DNA sequence variations in different species. Among 
different classes of molecular markers, microsatellite markers are the most 
favored.

Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are stretches of DNA 
consisting of tandemly repeated short units of 1_6 base pairs in length. 
Compared with other molecular markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) 
are more advantageous and used for a variety of applications because of 
their multi-allelic nature, reproducibility, co-dominant inheritance, high
abundance and extensive genome coverage  []. Various studies has been 
undertaken to identify microsatellites in different crop species including 
rice, wheat, maize, barley, soybean several medicinal and aromatic plants 
of commercial importance  []. In C. roseus, a number of microsatellite 
markers have recently been developed and deployed for the study of 
intraspecific and interspecific as well as intrageneric and intergeneric 
genetic polymorphism  []. However, most of these are genomic SSRs 
whose development is highly laborious, cumbersome and cost-intensive.

Currently, with the accumulation of biological data originating from whole 
genome sequence initiatives, the use of bioinformatics tools helps to 
maximize the identification of these sequences and consequently, the 
efficiency in the number of generated markers. Advances in genomic 
technologies have generated a large number of expressed sequence tags 
(ESTs) that has been made available in public database, thereby offering an 
opportunity to develop EST derived SSR markers by data mining. ESTs 
are short and single pass sequences read from mRNA (cDNA)  
[] 
representing a snapshot of genes expressed in a given tissue. EST_SSR 
markers are expected to possess high interspecific transferability as they 
belong to relatively conserved genic regions of the genome. With recent 
increasing emphasis on functional genomics, large datasets of ESTs are 
being developed, and with evolving bioinformatics tools, it is now possible 
to identify and develop EST_ SSR markers at a large scale in a time and 
cost-effective manner  [,
]. As of January 2011, GenBank had released 
21730 EST sequences from  Catharanthus roseus 
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/dbEST_summary.html). In this 
context, the use of EST or cDNA-based SSRs has been reported for several 
species including grape  ], 
sugarcane  ], durum wheat  
], rye  ]
and medicinal plant like basil  ]. Keeping the above point of view, the 
present study aims to assess the suitability of existing public databases for 
the mining of simple sequence repeats. We have mined updated EST 
libraries of  Catharanthus roseus  for this analysis to find the SSR 
polymorphisms. There are various SSR detecting softwares such as MISA 
], SSRFinder  
], SSRIT  
], TRF  
], TROLL  
], Sputnik 
(http://espressosoftware.com/pages/sputnik.jsp), 
Modified Sputnik I  ]
and Modified Sputnik II  ]. However, we used a new SSR detecting 
software SSR Locator ] to identify the SSR polymorphisms because of 
its user friendly Windows interface and ability to interpret results as html 
files.

Methodology
EST database of NCBI contains 21730  Catharanthus roseus  express 
sequence tag data. 21730 sequences retrieved were related to different 
plant tissues i.e leaves and root. The downloaded sequences were obtained 
in FASTA format for sequence assembly and SSR analysis. A single text 
file was compiled containing all the 21730 EST sequences.

The EST sequences were screened against the UniVec database from 
NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/ UniVec/) for detecting vector and 
adapter sequences by using the program Cross_Match  ]; the following 
parameters were used: minmatch  ≥13 and minscore  ≥20. Furthermore, 
polyA/T tails and X characters were removed using the EST_trimmer.pl 
script (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/download/est_trimmer.pl) until 
no stretch of (A/T)5 or (X)1 was present in a window of 100bp at the 5' or 
3' end, respectively. dbEST has redundancy in EST sequences. In order to 
remove the redundancy, EST sequences were assembled using the contig 
assembly program CAP3  ]. The sequences containing file was 
submitted in FASTA formatted text file. The results were in different 
output files e.g. unigenes, contigs and singlets. For the purpose of the SSR 
identification, we combined the contig and singlet sequences to form nonredundant 
sequence data set. The SSR detection tool SSR locator was used 
to detect EST-SSR loci. EST-derived SSRs were considered to contain 
motifs ranging in length from 2 to 6 nucleotides, with dinucleotide repeat 
numbers  ≥9, trinucleotide repeat numbers  ≥6, tetranucleotide repeat 
numbers  ≥5, pentanucleotide repeat numbers  ≥4, hexanucleotide repeat 
numbers ≥3, and compound SSR motif length ≥24 bp. 

Results and Discussions
ESTs are often represented by redundant cDNA sequences making it 
difficult to analyze them effectively for SSRs. To overcome this problem, 
the CAP3 program was used. The reduction in redundancy is used as a 
measure of degree of overlapping between EST sequences. The objective 
was the elimination of redundancy in EST sequences and arriving at a 
contiguous sequence (contigs) which can be used for analysis of SSRs. 
CAP3 is a commonly used program  ], which identifies overlapping 
sequences and generates contigs with consensus sequences.

The 21730 redundant EST sequences retrieved from NCBI scanned for 
Class I microsatellite repeats represented approximately 9.25Mb of 
Catharanthus roseus  genome. 632 SSR's were detected in this dataset 
corresponding to 1.0 SSR per 14.6 kb. During pre-processing, 835740 bp 
of empty vectors, low-quality sequences and Poly A/T tails were removed 
successfully. Trimming of poly A and poly T tails resulted in the removal 
of 9% of original dataset. Rest of the sequences were clustered and 
assembled into a non-redundant dataset of 5928 unique gene sequences 
(1227 contigs and 4704 singlets). Scanning of Class I microsatellites in this 
non-redundant dataset revealed 502 unique SSR containing sequences 
(, see ). This accounts to 1SSR per 
10.21kb of  Catharanthus roseus  genome  (, see 
). 
The reduction in redundancy of Class I SSR's obtained by 
trimming and clustering of non-redundant dataset is shown in  . 
Seventeen cases were found where two microsatellites were immediately
adjacent to each other; 57 ESTs contained two adjacent repeats at a 
distance of &lt;10 bp to each other. Cardle  et al 2000  [] estimated the 
average distances (in kb) between SSRs in sets of non-redundant ESTs of 
various plants such as rice (3.4), soybean (7.4), tomato (11.1), Arabidopsis 
(13.8), poplar (14.0) and cotton (20.0) through a comprehensive 
computational study. Considering the same criteria in the present study, 
SSRs occurs with a frequency of 1SSR per 14.6 kb in Catharanthus ESTs. 
This suggests that the frequency of cDNA-SSRs in the expressed portion 
of the Catharanthus genome is low in comparison to rice, soybean, tomato 
and Arabidopsis and higher than other plant species.

The occurrence of the individual SSR motifs among the non-redundant set 
of 502 SSRs is summarized in (see ). 
Obviously, the proportion of SSR unit sizes was not evenly distributed: 
221 (44%) were mononucleotide, 72 (14%) dinucleotide, 131 (26%) 
trinucleotide, 27 (5%) Tetranucleotide, 21 (4%) Pentanucleotide and 22 
(4%) hexa-nucleotide microsatellites. 1.6% of microsatellites were of 
compound types. The relative abundance of mononucleotides even after 
the trimming of poly A/T tracts could clearly indicate their occurrence of 
genome rather than at the ends of mRNA. Regarding dimeric SSRs, the 
motifs AG (41%) and AC (24%) were by far the most common ones, 
whereas AT is present only at low abundance i.e 7% only. The deficiency 
of AT SSRs in EST sequences is in accordance with reports from rice 
[], 
Arabidopsis [] and maize 
[]. AG/CT motif can represent codons GAG, 
AGA, UCU and CUC in mRNA population and code for R, E, A and L 
respectively. Since A and L are found in increased amount in proteins, the 
abundance of AG/CT in the genome can be substantiated. CG repeats are 
least found in cereal species  [] and in our present study CG/GC motif 
was completely absent. Among trimeric microsatellites, AAG (43%), AGG 
(22%) and AGC-CCG (19%) were the most-common motifs. ACG also 
accounted for 14%. In plants, common motif is AAG while CCG is a 
specific feature of monocot genome  []. 
Lu et al  2010  [], have found 
(AAG)n to be the most abundant repeat motif in Gossypium barbadense. 
Siju  et al  [] also found (AAG)n to be the most abundant in turmeric 
accounting to 8.2%. Similarly, trimeric motifs like AGG/CCT, AGC/CGT 
are also fairly well represented in rice  [], 
maize  [], pearl millet  
[], 
and barley []. 
ATT represented only 3% of the total trimeric SSRs. Most 
of the monocots and dicots used to have least amount of motif ATT owing 
to the fact that TAA-based variants code for stop codons that have a direct 
effect on protein synthesis  []. The most-frequent tetrameric 
microsatellite motifs were AAAC/GTTT and AAAT/ATTT. The penta and 
hexa nucleotides were found to be in lowest frequency. In all the repeat 
motifs, most of the SSR repeat motifs derived from the ESTs were A/T 
(36.25%) followed by AAG/CTT (8.56%), AG/CT (8.16%) and G/C 
(7.76%)  (). Rest of the repeat motifs accounted less than 5% 
contribution to the total SSR motifs. In the 1­6 repeat types, the most 
frequent repeat motifs were A/T, AG/CT, AAG/CTT, AAAC/GTTT, 
AAAAC/GTTTT, and AAAGCC/GGCTTT, which accounted for 56.94%, 
57.20%, 32.82%, 37.03%, 42.85% and 22.72% of all types, respectively.

Conclusion
Microsatellites serve for divergent roles in the field of plant genomics. EST 
databases provide a valuable resource for the development of microsatellite 
markers, which are associated with transcribed genes. Development of 
SSR markers from EST-databases saves both cost and time, once sufficient 
amounts of EST sequences are available. In the present study, we 
identified 502 non-redundant hyper variable microsatellites from EST data 
source of Catharanthus roseus using SSR identification tool SSR Locator. 
The frequency analysis described in the study could offer potential for the 
designing of suitable repeat probes for effective targeting and isolation of 
microsatellite repeats from Catharanthus. Moreover, these non-redundant 
SSR resources can be used to design informative SSR primers that can be 
applied in studies of genetic variation, linkage mapping, comparative 
genomics and characteristic distribution of genes on chromosomes of 
Catharanthus species.
