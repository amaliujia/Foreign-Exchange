Background
Ricin is a powerful cytotoxic protein. The tertiary (30) structure
of Ricin is a globular and glycosylated heterodimer, with an
approximate molecular weight of 60-65 kDa () 
[]. It
consists of two chains namely Ricin Toxin A Chain (RTA) and
Ricin Toxin B Chain (RTB). RTA and RTB are of approximately
similar molecular weight i.e. 32 kDa and 34 kDa respectively.
Ricin A Chain () is an N-glycoside hydrolase made up
of 267 amino acids []. It has three structural domains in which
approximately 50% of the polypeptides are arranged into α-
helices and β-sheets []. The three domains form a prominent
cavity that has formed an active site of RTA. Ricin B Chain
() is basically a lectin consisting of 262 amino acids
which can bind to the terminal galactose residues on cell
surfaces []. RTB forms a bilobal, barbell-like structure that
lacks α-helices and β-sheets, although individual lobes consist
of three subdomains. Ricin functions as a cytotoxin, in the
process where RTA is reductively cleaved from RTB in order to
remove a steric block, after the cleaving active site is exposed on
RTA []. N-glycosidase activity of the ricin protein was studied
[]. In eukaryotic ribosomes RTA specifically and irreversibly
cleaves the glycosidic bond of adenine at position 4324 within
the 28S rRNA of the 60S subunit. However, the phosphodiester
backbone of the RNA will remain intact []. RTA targets
adenine at position 4324 (A4324) of the highly conserved
sequence, which is about 12 nucleotides long and universally
found in eukaryotic ribosomes. This highly conserved sequence,
5'-AGUACGAGAGGA-3', is known as the SRL (Sarcin-Ricin
Loop) and is important for binding elongation factors during
protein synthesis []. The depurination event caused by RTA
rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, which results
in toxicity, in turn leads to inhibition of protein synthesis.
Approximately 1500 ribosomes are depurinated by a single
RTA molecule in the cytosol within a minute 
[]. There are
several invariable amino acid residues in the active site of RTA
that are involved in the depurination reaction of ribosomal
RNA []. The exact mechanism of the depurination event is
unknown but the key amino acid residues that are identified to
be involved in depurination reaction includes Arginine (ARG)
at position 180, Glutamic acid (GLU) at position 177 and
Tyrosine (TYR) at positions 80 and 123. In particular, ARG180
and GLU177 are involved in the catalytic mechanism, but not in
substrate binding []. This has been proved with enzyme
kinetic studies involving RTA mutants []. PTA and its
derivatives had been extensively studied, found proper binding
with RTA and with good biological activity []. Hence, we
have selected PTA as a seed molecule to perform ligand based
virtual screening. Ligand based virtual screening method will
give us number of molecules similar to the seed molecule 
[].
Ligand-based techniques derive knowledge from given active
molecule/molecules that are known to bind to the desired
target molecule, to use this knowledge search the candidate
molecules in large databases with similar properties 
[]. This
can be done by various methods, including similarity and
substructure searching [], 3D shape matching 
[] or
pharmacophore matching []. In this study, we have selected
similarity and substructure based searching approach for
screening the molecules with similar properties.

Methodology
X-ray crystallographic structure of target:
The 3-Dimensional crystal structure of Ricin Toxin-A Chain
(RTA) in complex with Pteroic Acid (PTA) inhibitor (PDB code:
1BR6) was selected from the Protein DataBank (PDB) 
[], as
the receptor/target model in virtual screening process.

Ligand ZINC database (Version - Eight):
ZINC database [] has been used screening. ZINC contains
over 13 million compounds in 3-Dimensional structural format
and ready-to-dock formats available for docking 
[].

Pocket-Finder
Pocket-Finder [] was used for active site (pocket) detection on
RTA protein.

Molegro Virtual Docker (Version- 3.2):
In this work Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 
[] has been used
for the prediction of protein-ligand interactions study 
[].

Results
Prediction of active site on RTA
Active site of RTA was predicted using the Pocket-Finder
program (). Active site consists of following amino
acid residues ASN78, TYR 80, VAL81, PHE93, GLY121,
ASN122, TYR123, ARG134, ILE172, GLU177, ARG180, GLU208,
ASN209 and TRP211 []. Results from earlier investigators had
represented that active site of Ricin Toxin-A chain (RTA) has
been complexed with ligand PTA ().

Virtual screening on ZINC database
Before screening ZINC database, the docking protocol was
validated. PTA ligand was re-docked within the binding pocket
of RTA (PDB ID: 1BR6) to obtain the docking based affinity
information. The ZINC database was searched on the basis of
structure of PTA in result of which 34 similar compounds were
found. All these compounds were docked with Molegro Virtual
Docker. Six high ranked compounds were then selected on the
basis of their interaction energies, hydrogen bonding and
internal energies etc., as described in Table 1 (see
). Three molecules were then selected
for structural docking with RTA protein, whose binding
energies were more than pteroic acid binding energy.

Depiction of binding mode of Pteroic Acid (PTA) within the active site of RTA:
Interactions of Pteroic Acid (PTA) in the binding pocket of RTA
are shown in . Pteroic Acid showed seven hydrogen
bond interactions within the active site of RTA. ARG180 formed
two hydrogen bonds with O22 of PTA (bond lengths are 2.57 Å
and 2.96 Å), SER176 also forms a hydrogen bond with O22 of
PTA (bond length is 3.43 Å), O19 of PTA formed a hydrogen
bond with ASN78 (bond length is 2.77 Å), VAL81 formed a
hydrogen bond with N5 of PTA (bond length is 3.04 Å) and
GLY121 formed two hydrogen bonds with N3 and N5 of PTA
(bond lengths are 2.57 Å and 2.96 Å respectively).

Binding studies of top three selected compounds after virtual screening:
Binding of 6, 7- Bis (3-fluorophenyl) pteridin-4-ol
(ZINC05156324) and RTA is shown in . ZINC05156324
also formed seven hydrogen bonds within the active site of
RTA. It formed two hydrogen bonds at O17 from ARG180
(bond lengths are 3.24 Å and 2.80 Å) and two hydrogen bonds
at N12 with ARG180 (bond lengths are 3.19 Å and 2.95 Å)
whereas, O17 formed one hydrogen bond with ALA79 (bond
length is 2.70 Å), one hydrogen bond is formed by N14 with
VAL81 (bond length is 2.85 Å). Further SER176 and O17 can act
as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor for each other (bond
length is 3.08 Å).

Interaction between 6, 7-bis (4-fluorophenyl) - 1H- pteridin -4-
one (ZINC08555900) and RTA is shown in . Seven
hydrogen bond interactions are found between ZINC08555900
and RTA. It formed three hydrogen bonds with O13, one from
SER176 and two from ARG180 (bond lengths are 3.28 Å, 3.27 Å
and 3.00 Å respectively). It formed two hydrogen bonds at N11
from ARG180 (bond lengths are 3.10 Å and 3.26 Å) and formed
one hydrogen bond at N14 from VAL81 and one at N16 from
GLY121 (bond lengths are 2.79 Å and 3.17 Å respectively).
 illustrates the interaction between 6, 7 diphenyl
pteridine − 4 - ol (ZINC05156321) and the active site of RTA.
ZINC05156321 shows seven hydrogen bond interactions within
the active site of RTA. ZINC05156321 formed a hydrogen bond
at Ala 79 from O16 (bond length is 2.56 Å) and two hydrogen
bonds with N11 from Arg180 (bond lengths are 3.05 Å and 2.89
Å). It has also formed two hydrogen bonds with O16 from
Arg180 (bond lengths are 3.10 Å and 2.93 Å). Further one
hydrogen bond is formed by N13 from Val81 (bond length is
2.85 Å), Ser176 and O16 act as both hydrogen bond donor and
acceptor for each other (bond length is 3.29 Å).

Discussion
Novel RTA inhibitors help in the treatment of Racinin based
toxicity effectively (&amp;
). Pteroic acid (PTA) has been
proved to be one of such inhibitors. Interestingly, its docked
structural information is also available. It is known that the
Pterin ring of PTA inhibitor binds in the active site of RTA and
forms hydrogen bonds with the active site residues 
[]. Hence,
virtual screenings were performed on RTA active site and 34
similar molecules have been found. Out of the 34 molecules, six
molecules were selected based on binding energies, dock scores,
interaction energies, HBond energy, VdW and internal energy
of poses, number of hydrogen bonds etc., as shown in Table 1
.
The six ligands were docked deep inside the binding pocket of
RTA. Three molecules were then selected (, 
,  &amp; 
) 
based on their resemblance of similar orientation, as
observed with Pteroic acid ligand 
[] and having more binding
energies than PTA. PTA formed seven hydrogen bonds with all
surrounding residues of ASN78, VAL81, GLY121, SER176 and
ARG180 with interaction energy of ­138.4 Kcal/mole. It was
spatially fit in to the active site with good electrostatic
interaction. Whereas, best ranked ZINC05156324 (6, 7-bis (3-
fluorophenyl) pteridin-4-ol) has been found to be potential
inhibitor upon all the molecules by interacting with
surrounding amino acids like ALA 79, VAL 81, SER 176 and
ARG 180 by forming hydrogen bonds. It has formed seven
hydrogen bonds with high interaction energy of ­154.625, also
with better electrostatic interaction and also spatially fit. Rest of
the two molecules showed high interaction energies when
compared to PTA with residues like ALA 79, VAL 81, GLY 121,
SER 176 and ARG 180, both of the molecules showed seven
hydrogen bonds approximately with ­144.00 interaction
energies. Hence, the above said three molecules can be
considered as potential RTA inhibitors. The above said
molecules may function as effective inhibiters because they are
exactly binding with active site of RTA, which has a role in
binding with ribosome and for RNA depurination function 
[].
They may be tested on in vitro and in vivo conditions. As per
earlier reports Miller et al., (2002) designed RTA inhibitory
molecules based on structure of the RTA active site and also
experimentally selected highly soluble molecules as Ricin
inhibitors []. 
Robertus et al., (2008) has developed molecules
based on RTA (Ricin Toxin A chain) active site structure based
virtual screening. Whereas in our work ligand structure (PTA)
based similarity [] 
search approach (virtual screening) has been implemented on ZINC database.

Conclusion
Virtual screening methods are widely used for reducing the cost
and time of drug discovery process. We show the identification
of six new compounds as potent inhibitor of RTA using virtual
screening. Nonetheless, these molecules should be tested for in
vitro and in vivo activities in future for consideration as effective
inhibitors.
