Background
Type-II Diabetes mellitus is the most common form of diabetes. In this case, patients can still produce insulin, but they do not 
produce enough or their bodies can't use it properly. At present, there are about 125 million people affected by the disease globally. 
It has been projected by the year 2010; the no. of persons with diabetes will double. []
Reversible protein phosphorylation is the predominant strategy used to control the activity of proteins in eukaryotic cells. 
Approximately 30¢ of 10,000 proteins in a typical mammalian cell are thought to be phosphorylated. 
[] Many cellular functions could be artificially manipulated if one could 
exogenously control the activity of protein kinases and phosphatases. [] This 
has led to intense interest in identifying small molecules capable of inhibiting action of specific kinases. 
[] or phosphatases. [,
] Major goal of new therapies for Type-II Diabetes is to 
potentiate action of insulin. One of key proteins involved in insulin signaling is insulin receptor. When insulin binds to its receptor, 
changes in intracellular confirmation of receptor result in o-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues. 
[] This serves as first step in insulin signaling and it is followed by a cascade 
of intracellular events that mediate the physiological effects of insulin. [] 
There is compelling evidence that protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B is primarily responsible for dephosphorylation of insulin receptor and 
therefore acts to downregulate insulin signaling. [–] 
A PTP1B inhibitor would be expected to increase the half life of phosphorylated 
insulin receptor and enhance the effects of insulin. The development of PTP1B inhibitors began in early 1990 and continues today. 
[,] Formylchromone derivatives 
[], 1, 2-Naphthoquinone derivatives [] 
and Oxalyl aryl amino benzoic acid derivatives [] have been identified as 
potent inhibitors for PTP1B. In an effort to develop a small, potent and selective PTP1B inhibitor, we used iterative structure based 
drug design to identify and optimize a lead compound.

Methodology
Crystal Structure of PTP1B
The crystal structure of PTP1B (PDB-ID: 1NZ7) was retrieved from protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and its coordinates were selected for docking studies by BioMed 
CAChe 6.1. This crystal structure of PTP1B contains 2563atoms. Before docking H-atoms were added to protein for correct ionization and 
automeric states of amino acid residues such as Asp, Ser, Glu, Arg, His and also bond types were corrected for HET groups. 

Active site analysis
The active site was analyzed by selecting neighbors within 3A0 around ligand. The active site contains Arg24, Ser28, Tyr46, Asp48, 
Val49, lys120. Ser216, Ala217, Gly218, Meth258, Gly259, Gln262, Thr263 and Gln266.

Selection of docking molecules
A set of 63 inhibitors as shown in   were designed in Chem office software from most 
active oxalyl aryl amino benzoic acid derivative found from literature [] whose 
structure is shown in . The active molecule was modified from position a, b, c and d as shown in 
.

Molecular Modeling
Phosphatase1B inhibitors were built and energy minimized on Biomed CAChe. For calculating energy BioMed CAChe provides classical 
mechanics, quantum mechanics and includes solvent effects of water by using COSMO (Conductor-like screening Model, which approximates 
the dielectric screening energy of a solvent by the method of image charges). The geometry optimization was carried out for each 
modified molecule by solving Schrodinger equation using the MOPAC6 (Molecular Orbital Package, which contains a method for modeling 
the effect of highly polar solvents) and semi empirical AM1 Hamiltonian.

Docking by Superposition
The fastest and easiest method for docking a ligand into active site is to superimpose the ligand on to a bound ligand already in 
the active site and the delete the bound ligand. The modified ligand was superimposed on already docked ligand (active molecule) in 
crystal structure of PTP1B and then already docked ligand was removed and then H-bonds were calculated among modified 
ligand and PTP1B.

BioMed CAChe Docking Score
Docking score was carried out in project leader of BioMed CAChe in which active site of PTP1B was fixed but ligand was flexible. 
Cache docking score performs force fields which includes terms as bond stretching, angle bending, torsional, and nonbonded interactions 
such as Vander Waals and Hydrogen bond interactions. The molecule based scoring function and is made up of four components 
1. Protein-ligand H-bond energy (external H-bond). 2. Protein-ligand Vander Waals energy (external vdw). 3. Ligand internal Vander 
waals energy (internal vdw). 4. Ligand intramolecular H-bond energy (internal H-bond).

Docking Score = S (hb_ext) + S (vdw_ext) + S (hb_int) + S (vdw_int)

Results and Discussion
The docking of modified oxalyl aryl amino benzoic acid derivatives into active site of PTP1B was carried out using Cache 6.1. 
The final docking score in Kcal/mol for each docking experiment was calculated. The docking evaluations were made on basis of H-bond 
and docking score. The molecules having improved docking score and H-bonding interactions are given below:

(. 
Active molecule entered into hydrophobic region of protein comprising amino acid residues indicated in 
Table 2. The docking score was found to be -98.584Kcal/mol.

-130.261Kcal/mol. Modified inhibitor entered into hydrophobic region of protein comprising amino acid residues indicated in 
Table 2(). The best RMSD was found to be 0.8523.

Four H-bonds were observed with protein amino acid residues that are Ala217, Arg221, Gly220 and Arg24 as
indicated in Table 1a (()) when [1b(a3, b2, c2, d)] molecule 
was docked into active site of PTP1B. The docking score was found to be -130.596Kcal/mol. Modified inhibitor entered into hydrophobic 
region of protein comprising amino acid residues indicated in Table 2 (()). 
The best RMSD was found to be 0.7418.

Seven H-bonds were observed with protein amino acid residues that are Ala217, Arg221, Gly220, Gly218 and
Arg24 as indicated in  and Table 1a
() when [1b(a2, b2, c1, d)] molecule 
was docked into active site of PTP1B.

The docking score was found to be -131.740Kcal/mol.Modified inhibitor entered into hydrophobic region of
protein comprising amino acid residues indicated in Table 2 (). 
The best RMSD was found to be 1.0956.

Two H-bonds were observed with protein amino acid residue Ala217 only as indicated in Table 1b
() when [1b (a3, b2, c1, d)] molecule 
was docked into active site of PTP1B, The docking score was found to be -122.297Kcal/mol. Modified inhibitor entered into hydrophobic 
region of protein comprising amino acid residues indicated in Table 2

Three H-bonds were observed with protein amino acid residues that are Gly220, Ile219 and Asp48 as indicated in 
Table 1b() when [1b(a2, b3, c2, d)] molecule was
docked into active site of PTP1B. The docking score was found to be -121.306Kcal/mol. Modified inhibitor entered into
hydrophobic region of protein comprising amino acid residues indicated in Table 2

In active molecule five H-bonds have been observed whereas in modified molecule i.e. [1b (a2, b2, c1 d)] seven H-bonds have
been observed and hydrophobic region has also expanded in modified molecule comprising amino acid residues such as
Asp29, Gly259, Arg254, Cys226, Arg79, Glu76, Phe52, Met253 and Val253.But active molecule contains only three amino acid residues such 
as Arg24, Arg254 and Arg257 in hydrophobic region. Hence it has been observed modified ligand leads to stronger interaction with PTP1B 
than active molecule found from literature. Further, from our docking studies, it has been shown that the diamides of alanine linker
forms H-bond with Asp48 in active ligand but not in [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)]. WPD loop remains open in both active ligand 
and [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)]. Oxamic acid group in [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)] shows stronger interactions with 
Ala217, Arg221, Gly220 and Gly218 in comparison to active ligand which shows interaction only with Gly220 and Ala217. The carboxylic
acid of methonine in [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)] interacts with Arg24 but not in active ligand. Lipophilic side chain of
methionine in [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)] lies in closer vicinity of hydrophobic region of protein consisted of Meth258 and
Phe52 in comparison to active ligand. Docking Score in [1b (a2, b2, c1, d)] is -131.740Kcal/mol which is much better
than active ligand score -98.584Kcal/mol.

Conclusion

studied in the present work, to identify the inhibitor binding position and affinity to PTP1B using BioMed
CAChe 6.1. On the basis of improved H-bonding and docking score than the active compound found in literature
it has been concluded that modified oxalyl aryl amino benzoic acid derivative [1b(a2, b2, c1, d)] molecule can
proved to be better inhibitor than the active ligand found in literature.
