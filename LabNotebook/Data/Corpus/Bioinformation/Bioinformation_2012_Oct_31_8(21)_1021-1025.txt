Background
With the extensive use of antibiotics, the severe problem of
antibiotic resistance has become far-reaching. Therefore,
intensive search for new antibiotics is required on a global
basis. Production of secondary metabolites by microorganisms
differs qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the strains
and species of microorganisms used as well as on their
nutritional and cultural conditions [] and as fermentation
moves into lower-value, higher-volume substrates, it becomes
necessary to maximize the efficiency and minimize costs by
using waste by-products to complete effectively with traditional
high-value, low-volume compounds []. To make the
production of antibiotics feasible, it is necessary to optimize the
antibiotic production conditions. This paper reports the
influence of medium components on antibiotics production by
Streptomyces hygroscopicus a new soil isolate using a statistical
design.

Methodology
Statistical optimization using Plackett–Burman design (PBD):
Streptomyces hygroscopicus, was maintained on ISP-2 slants
containing (g/L) yeast extract 4.0, malt extract 10, glucose 4.0,
CaCO3 2.0 and agar powder 20. Submerged fermentation was
carried out by cultivating the active isolate for 3 days at 28 °C,
180 rpm in 1 L Erlenmeyer flask with 200 ml production
medium comprising of (g/L) soybean meal 10, CaCO3 3,
MgSO4.7H2O 0.5, (NH4)2HPO4 0.5, NaCl 3, K2HPO4 1, glucose
15, pH 6.9–7.0. To identify the most important medium
components for antibiotic production Plackett–Burman design
(PBD) was used in the present study []. The Plackett-Burman
design (PB) was based on the first-order model, with no
interaction among the factors []. In this experiment, four
independent and three dummy variables were selected for the
screening in 8 trials. Each variable was represented at two levels
high (H) and low (L)  (see supplementary material).
Dummy variables were used in design to estimate error in
experiment. The effect of each variable was determined by the
following equation:

E (X1) = 2 (ΣM1H -ΣM1L) / N → (1)

where E(xi) is the concentration effect of tested variable; MlH is
the antibiotic activity from the trials where variable was
present at the high concentration, MlL is the antimicrobial
activity from trials where the variable present at the low
concentration, and N is the total number of trials. Experimental
error was estimated by calculating the variance among the
dummy variables as given below

Veff = Σ(Ed)2 / n → (2)

where Veff is the variance of the concentration effect, Ed is the
concentration effect for the dummy variable, and n is the
number of dummy variables. The standard error (SE) of the
concentration effect was the square root of the variance of the
effect, i.e., SE = √Vef . The significance level (p value) of each
concentration effect was determined using Student's t-test

SE = √ Veff → (3); t(X1) = E(X1) / SE → (4)

Three variables were found to be most effectual components for
the antibiotic production on the basis of PBD, were selected to
identify the optimized conditions for the maximum production
of antimicrobial components using central composite design
(CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) [].
Optimization of the selected medium components by RSM
using CCD response surface designs are used to explore nonlinear
relationships between independent (medium
components) and dependent (antibiotic yield) variables. These
relationships facilitate in selecting the optimum medium
components concentrations for production of higher amount of
product []. Total twenty experiments with eight cube points,
six star points and six replicas of the central point were
employed to fit the second order polynomial model. Design
along with the range and levels of the three selected variables
are shown in  (see supplementary material).

Following regression equation was developed by the
application of RSM showing a relationship between the coded
units of the medium components and the logarithmic values of
antibiotic yield.

Y =b0+b1xi+ b2xii+ b3xiii +b4x2i +b5x2ii +b6x2iii +b7xi.xii +b8xi.xiii
+b9xii.xiii → (5)

where Y is the dependent or response variable, b is the
regression coefficient and x is the coded or un-coded level of the
independent variables. ‘Statistica 7.0’ was used for the graphical
and statistical analysis of the data obtained from CCD. The
optimum values of the selected variables were obtained by
analyzing the response surface/contour plots and also by
analyzing the regression equation [].

Discussion
Active purified compound from Streptomyces hygroscopicus
showed activity against Gram positive and Gram negative
bacterial as well as fungal pathogens () and chemically
characterized as hygromycin. Absorbance at 203 nm in the UV–
vis spectra, suggested the presence of amide group in the
structure. Presence of M+H peak at 527.47 confirmed that the
molecular weight was corresponding to the other reported
hygromycin b. Structure elucidation has been done with the
detailed analysis of IR, 1H, 13C NMR data and elemental
analysis which is being communicated elsewhere (data not
shown). Chemical structure of hygromycin is represented in
().

Screening of important components for the antibiotic production:
Antibiotic production with normal unoptimized medium was
found to be 37 mg/L. For medium optimization the effects of
various medium components at different concentrations were
investigated with the help of PBD, in which probability values
less than 0.05 (p &lt; 0.05) indicated significance of the model term
whereas p-values greater than 0.1 (p &gt; 0.1) indicated model
terms were not significant. Therefore the medium components,
soybean meal (t = 4.02, p = 0.001), CaCO3 (t = 7.14, p = 0.0001)
and glucose (t = 3.21, p = 0.001) with higher t-value and lower p
values were considered as significant components for optimum
antibiotic production ().

Optimization of the selected medium components by statistical experimental design:
CCD is an important tool to determining the optimal level of
medium constituents and their interaction. Based on the PBD
soybean meal, glucose and CaCO3 were selected for their
remarkable effect on the antibiotic production at CCD was used
for further optimization. The experimental responses of the
RSM for studying the effect of soybean meal, glucose and
CaCO3 on the antibiotic production are summarized in 

(see supplementary material). The regression coefficient of
each variable in terms of linear, quadratic and interaction along
with t and p-values are shown in  (see supplementary
material). Coefficients with lower p-values (p &lt; 0.05) are more
significant [–]. Higher significance of linear, quadratic and
interactive effects of soybean meal, glucose and CaCO3 (p xi =
0.000013, p x2= 0.000001, p x2i = 0.00000, p x2
ii = 0.00000, p x2iii
=0.000003, p xi.xii = 0.000114, p xi.xiii = 0.002580, p xii.xiii =
0.002735) suggested that they have a direct relationship with the
antibiotic production. Interaction effect of xi.xiii and xii.xiii has
low significant value, however linear effect of p xiii had no
significant effect on antibiotic production (p xiii = 0.241140).
Analysis of variances (ANOVA), to validate the regression
coefficient was performed which suggested the adequacy of the
second order response surface model  (see
supplementary material). The Fisher F-test with a very low
probability value (F = 55.67784, p = 0.00000) shows the high
statistical significance of the regression model []. High value of
correlation coefficient (R = 0.990169) explains an excellent
correlation between the independent variables i.e. medium
components [].

The goodness of the fit of the model is explained by the
determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9804343) which indicates that
the second order polynomial model eq. 6 could explain 98% of
the total variation and only 2% of the total variations were not
explained by the model. Higher value of the adjusted
determination coefficient (adj. R2 = 0.962825) further point outs
the high significance of the model [,
]. The application of
RSM yielded following regression equation showing positive
linear and negative quadratic effect. This equation expressed a
relationship between the logarithmic values of antibiotic yield
and concentration of the medium components. Since the overall
regression equation is significant hence the terms which are
individually non-significant are also considered in the equation
[,
,
].:

3D graphs assist understanding of the main as well as the
interaction effects of two factors. 3D graphs were created for the
pair-wise combination of the three factors while keeping the
other one at its optimum levels for antibiotic production 
(). It is obvious from the plots that the higher concentration of
glucose, middle concentration of the soybean meal and CaCO3
are responsible for the higher antibiotic production where the
production of crude was predicted 405 mg/L. The predicted
yield was verified by performing an experiment with the
optimized concentrations in basal medium and the antibiotic
production was around 412 mg/L which was found to be close
to the predicted value and ten times more than with the normal
unoptimized production medium (37 mg/L).
