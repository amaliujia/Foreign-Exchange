Background
AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome
mainly caused by HIV virus [,
]. According to WHO report in
year 2010 around 34 million people were affected out of which
16.8 million were women and 3.4 million people were of less
than 15 years age group []. Two types of antivirals are
available i.e., reverse transcriptase inhibitors it inhibit reverse
transcriptase enzyme and nucleosides analogues for example
Zidovudine, Lamivudine etc. Protease inhibitor act by inhibiting
HIV protease and thus inhibiting virus assembly examples are
Nelfinavir, Ritonavir []. However combination of both the
types proves to be effective in most cases better combination is
Zidovudine (AZT) and Ritonavir []. HIV-Nef plays an
important role by down regulating the surface expression of
CD4, MHC-I, MHC-II, and CD28 which are critically involved
in immune synapse formation []. It also increases the survival
rate of infected cells by avoiding outside-in and inside-in death
signal that may be p53 independent or dependent []. Number
of residues are involved in interaction with CD4 and WL (57-58)
in flexible loop, and residues Glycine 95, Glycine 96, Leucine 97,
Arginine 106, leucine 110 present in Nef core region ()
[]. The dileucine motif 165/166 and acidic motif EDE 174-176
are critical for down regulation of CD4 []. Hence Nef protein
has been selected and subjected for drug designing.

Methodology
Multiple Sequnce alignment (MSA):
The amino acid sequences of various strains of HIV-Nef protein
were selected from National Centre of Biotechnology
Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) database. Clustal W and
the distance tree analysis have been performed to find
mutations in Nef- SH3 domain interactive region by using
MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software.
Various residues of Nef and SH-3 domain participated in the
interaction were diagrammatically presented ().

Virtual Screening for ligand selection:
PubChem Id- 308963 produced highest cell inhibition 
[]. Hence
above said molecule has been used as a reference molecule to
generate combinatorial library of molecules. For the high
quality molecular diversity library generation, we have selected
the molecules on the basis of their structural similarity and
biochemical properties []. The molecules were selected fom
Pubchem database and Zinc database which are having
structural similarity upto 70% to the reference molecule. Further
the molecules were filtered based on biochemical properties
similarity to reference compound like log P, molecular weight,
rotable bonds, net charges, number of hydrogen bonds donors
and acceptors, polar desolvation energy. The molecules were
futhur filtered by using the Lipinski's rule of five for
differentiating between drug-like and non drug-like molecules
[]. Molecules in SDF file format was converted into Mol2
format with the help of Open Babel software. The generated
combinatorial library was used for virtual screening for using
Molegro Virtual Docker []. After screening top ten molecules
were selected on the basis of their Mol Dock score and further
analysis was done.

Molecular Docking:
Molecular docking has been performed between receptor
protein HIV-Nef and reference molecule CID 308963, (5-[(4-tertbutylphenoxy)
carbonylamino]-2-hydroxybenzoic acid). Top
five screened ligand molecule have also been docked with HIVNef
protein individually.

Result
MSA Analysis:
Nef protein sequences of various HIV 1 strains were subjected
to multipl alignment by using MEGA software. Multiple
sequence alignment did not reveal much changes in the active
site region between 70 – 120 amino acids. Most of the amino
acids in this region mainly remained conserved. This implies
that there was no significant change present in active site
region. Distance tree results also implies that large number of
sequences arising from same parent node, hence the above said
active site has been used for virtual screening against generated
combinatorial library.

Virtual Screening Analysis:
The reference molecule PubChem Id 308963: (5-[(4-tertbutylphenoxy)
carbonylamino]-2-hydroxybenzoic acid)
molecular weight is 329.24 Da, three hydrogen bond donors and
five hydrogen bond acceptors, log P of 5.3 and five rotatable
bonds. It has shown MolDock score of -40.36 and having
hydrogen bond energy of -1.24 KJ/mol. After virtual screening
against HIV-Nef active site, top ten molecules from 1780
molecules were selected based on MolDock score  (see
supplementary material). ZINC059063351 molecule has proved
as best ligand because of its least score (-157.04KJ/mol). It
showed four hydrogen bonds interaction and three strong
electrostatic interaction within the active site (). This
protein-ligand complex showed having hydrogen bond energy
of -4.17 and Ligand efficiency 1 of -4.24 with molecular weight
of 495.5. Out of these top ten molecules top five molecules have
been chosen for, further detail docking study with HIV- Nef
protein on Autodock software.

Molecular Docking Analysis:
The molecular docking has been performed between HIV-Nef
protein and reference molecule as well as top five selected
molecules obtained after virtual screening (). Analysis
results have been compared and found ZINC 059063351
molecule and HIV-Nef is showing best interaction with least
binding energy (-7.52 KJ/Mol), which is better than reference
molecule CID 308963 (-4.57 KJ/Mol)  (see
supplementary material).

Discussion
HIV-Nef protein helps in the down regulation of T – helper cells
by mainly acting on CD4, MHC I, MHC II receptors and thus
decreases the immunity of the host [,
]. Only a single reference
molecule is available till date that inhibits the interaction of Nef
with human receptor []. The main objective of this study was
to find the molecules that are similar to known inhibitor in
structure and passing through the Lipinski rule of five, similarly
above said filters were used by Das et al., &amp; Lipinski et al, 
[,
].
A combinatorial library comprising of 1780 molecules was
generated. Molecules were docked against target by using
Molegro Virtual Docker and sorted according to their Mol Dock
Score in decending order, similar work has been performed by
Langer et al., [,
]. On the basis of this score the top ten
molecules were selected and further studied. These molecules
showed binding energy in range of-142.11 to-157.04 KJ/Mol.
The average of total binding energy of top ten molecules around
-149.57 KJ/Mol. The hydrogen binding energy is in range of –
1.31 to -6.90 and the average found to be -4.5. The ZINC
059063351 molecule showed lowest binding energy of -7.52
KJ/mol which is better than reference molecule, hence it can be
suggested as a best inhibitor for Nef protein. It may be tested
further experimentally.

Conclusion
Nef is one of the accessory proteins of HIV genome therfore it
plays an important role in down regulation of host immunity. In
current work, HIV-Nef protein has been subjected for virtual
screening by the ligands collected through combinatorial library
approach. Finally it was found that ZINC059063351 is a
potential drug molecule with better binding energy and
hydrogen bonding. The above said molecule may tested
experimentally for future use.
