third of epithelial cancers. Hence, blockade of the binding sites for EGFR has been hypothesized as an effective anti-cancer therapy.
Chalcone derivative compounds have been shown to be highly effective anti-cancer agents, however there are still so many novel
derivatives possible, one of which might get us the best targeted EGFR inhibitor. In this effort directed towards the discovery of
novel, potent anti-tumor agents for the treatment of cancer, in the present study a library of novel chalcone series of compounds
has been designed and evaluated for their anti-cancer activity targeting EGFR kinase domain using various computational
approaches. Among the twenty five novel designed chalcone series of compounds, all of them have found to be successfully
docking inside the active binding domain of EGFR receptor target with a binding energy in a range of -6.10 to -9.25 Kcal/mol with
predicted IC50 value range of 33.50 micor molar to 164.66 nano molar respectively. On the other hand, calculated 2DQSAR
molecular descriptor properties of the compounds showed promising ADME parameters and found to be well in compliance with
Lipinski׳s rule of five. Among all the twenty five compounds tested, compound 21 ((2E)-3-(anthracen-9-yl)-1-phenylprop-2-2n-1-
one) was found to be the best lead like molecule with a binding energy of -9.25 kcal/mol with predicted IC50 value of 164.66 nano
molar. Conclusively, novel designed compound 21 of the present study have shown promising anti-cancer potential worth
considering for further evaluations.

Background
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of crucial role
player in the process angiogenesis, a critical step for the
survival of cancer cells. This growth factor receptor kinase play
important role in the progression, aggressiveness,
development and metastasis of many solid tumors, such as
head and neck cancers, non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
and glioblastomas. Particularly, the involvement of the EGFR
family of tyrosine kinases in cancer proliferation suggests that
blockade of the binding sites for EGFR has been hypothesized
as an effective anti-cancer therapy [1]. EGFR gene encodes
protein containing 621 residues and 1186 amino acids, which
compromise the binding site for specific ligand amino acid
residues and extra cellular domain, which server binding site
for EGFR inhibitors [2]. A number of small molecule inhibitors
of EGFR tyrosine kinase are under clinical development
besides monoclonal antibody based therapies 
[3–4].

Synthetically and pharmacologically chalcones series of
compounds have been recognized as a unique class of small
compounds with a wide range of applications. Chalcone
derivative compounds have been shown to be highly effective
anti-cancer agents, however there are still so many novel
derivatives possible, one of which might get us the best
targeted EGFR inhibitor. In this present study we have
designed novel chalcones derivatives from di flouro
acetophenones reacted with different aldehydes by clasein-
Schmidt reactions [5]. We have chosen to design derivatives for
chalcones structure in specific based on their versatile nature
and for their synthesis and pharmacological actions. In the
present study a library of novel chalcone series of compounds
has been designed and evaluated for their anti-cancer activity
targeting EGFR kinase domain using various computational
approaches in an effort directed towards the discovery of
novel, potent target specific anti-tumor agents for the
treatment of cancer.

Methodology
Computational methods:
Software and program:
Schrodinger׳s maestro visualization program v9.6 [6] is
utilized to visualize the receptors, ligand structures, hydrogen
bonding network, to calculate length of the bonds and to
render images. Chemsktech was used to draw the ligand
compounds. Autodock 4.0 [7] is the primary docking program
used in this work for the semi-flexible docking studies.
Preparation of the ligands and protein receptors in pdbqt file
and determination of the grid box size were carried out using
Auto-Dock Tools version 1.5.6. Molinspiration, Orissis
property explorer program was used to study the ADMET
properties of the compounds.

Preparation of protein receptor and Ligand:
The crystal structure of the EGFR kinase domain [PDB: 1M17]
was obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [8]. The crystal
structure contained many missing atoms which were
supplemented by the repair commands module of AutoDock.
Before docking, the protein crystal structure was cleaned by
removing the water molecules. H-atoms were added to these
target proteins for correct ionization and tautomeric states of
amino acid residues. The modified structure so obtained was
used for the semi-flexible dockings. The ligand molecules was
drawn using chemsketch software. The energy of the ligand
molecule and receptors were minimized in Steepest Descent
and Conjugate Gradient methods using Accelrys Discovery
Studio (Version 4.0, Accelrys Software Inc.) [9]. The
minimization methods were carried out with CHARMM force
field [10].

Semi-flexible docking:
Autodock Version 4.0 is used to predict binding pose with
associated energy along with the IC50 value prediction of the
compounds with drug target EGFR Kinase domain. Protocol
followed for carrying out the docking studies using Autodock
version 4.0 in order to predict binding pose and IC50 values
along with associated binding energies is of default parameters
similar to the protocol followed elsewhere 
[11–13]. Briefly, the
energy scoring grid box was set to 126, 126 and 126 Å (x, y, and
z) centered at X = 0.041; Y = -0.068 and Z = 0.128 with 0.375
angstroms grid points spacing assigned with default atomic
salvation parameters. The grid box was designed such that the
active site of EGFR kinase domain was surrounded by the
three dimensional grid box centered at its active ligand
binding site location. Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA)
[14] was selected as docking engine, with all the docking
parameters set to default. After each LGA run, Autodock
reports the best docking solution along with IC50 values for
each docked complex, and the results are reported based on
cluster analysis. Binding Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is calculated
as a sum of six energy terms of dispersion/repulsion,
electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, deviation from
covalent geometry, desolvation effects and internal ligand
torsional constraints. From a total of 10 docking modes
represented by LGA cluster analysis, the lowest energy
docking mode with respective IC50 prediction was selected
from each docking simulation. Each compound was allowed
with active rotatable bonds making them flexible.

Pharmacological properties of the compounds:
Osiris Property Explorer (www. organicchemistry. org/prog/peo/) 
[15] online server along with data warrior software 
[16]
was used to check the pharmaceutical fidelity of the drug
candidates. Molecular descriptors, such as Log P, the number
of hydrogen bond donors, the number of hydrogen bond
acceptors, and the molecular mass of the compounds were
analyzed. Osiris Property Explorer was also used in analyzing
various attributes of the drugs, such as toxicity and drug score.

Results &amp; Discussion
Docking of the compounds with EGFR Kinase domain active site:
We have performed the docking studies for the present studied
twenty compounds with the EGFR Kinase domain protein
targeting its active binding site in order to know the binding
energy involved in this complex formation and to know the
molecular interactions responsible for this target specific
inhibition. Docking results are tabulated in Table 1 (see
supplementary material). All the twenty five compounds
studied in this present work have shown to be successfully
docking inside the active site of EGFR kinase domain with a
binding energy in a range of -6.10 to -9.25 Kcal/mol. We have
compared our docking results with some of the FDA approved
drugs for EGFR, as per the literature it is evident that Erlotinib,
gefitini, Doxorubicin and Lapatinib were showing binding
energy of -8.43, -8.53, -8.86 and -8.33 Kcal/mol respectively
Table 2 (see supplementary material). When these docking
results for the control FDA drugs compared with our
compounds docking results, it was identified that compound
21 and 22 are showing better binding energies than these
controls by showing -8.80 and -9.25 Kcal/mol of binding
energy respectively. As per the molecular docking results, it
was revealed that Compound 21 has the best estimated -9.25
Kcal/mol of binding energy Table 1 (see supplementary
material) for the EGFR kinase domain inhibited complex
formation by forming a hydrogen bond with LYS721. Apart
from hydrogen bonds, this compound was also found to be
forming Van der waals interactions with MET742; THR830;
THR766; ALA719; CYS751; LEU820; GLN767; LEU768;
MET769; LEU694; ILE720; VAL702; ILE765 and LEU764
residues (Figure 1).

IC50 prediction:
In order to understand the plausible experimental anti-cancer
activity of the present studied compounds, we have carried out
the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value
predictions. IC50 value is a useful parameter to quantitatively
measure the effectiveness of compound to inhibit a given
biological process by half and is universally used to symbolize
the inhibitory effect of compounds [17]. Table 1 (see
supplementary material) shows the predicted IC50 value for
the compounds 1-25 were in a range of 33.50 micro molar to
164.66 nano molar. We have compared our docking results
with some of the FDA approved drugs for EGFR, as per the
literature it is evident that Erlotinib, gefitini, Doxorubicin and
Lapatinib were showing binding energy of 5.0, 0.08, 0.30,
779.60 µM respectively. When these IC50 values for the control
FDA drugs compared with our compounds, it was identified
that compound 21 and 22 are showing better inhibition
constant than these controls by showing 164.66 and 351.87
nanomolar respectively [20–2] 
Table 2 (see supplementary
material). Among which the compound 21 has shown the best
possible inhibitory potential with 164.66 nano molar, whereas
compound 20 with least predicted IC50 value of 33.50 micro
molar. IC50 values obtained clearly demonstrated plausible
high inhibitory potential of present studied compounds with
kinase domain of EGFR.

Prediction of pharmacological properties:
Osiris Property Explorer was utilized to predict the
pharmacological properties of the present studied compounds
according to Lipinski׳s Rule of Five [18] and Oral
Bioavailability. The pharmacological attributes prediction
results are displayed in Table 3 (see supplementary material).
Based on the experimental values, it was inferred that all the
compounds successfully satisfied all the parameters of
Lipinski׳s Rule of Five. The parameters of the Lipinski׳s rule
are as follows: the molecular weight must be &lt; 500 Da,
Log P &lt; 5, the number of hydrogen donors must be &lt; 5, the
number of acceptor hydrogens must be &lt; 10, and the
refractivity molar range must be between 40–130. However,
one parameter exception can be given out of above mentioned
ones.

As per the veber׳s rule [19], oral bioavailability of drugs could
be measured by the molecular weight, number of rotatable
bonds (n rotb), number of hydrogen bonds, and the expanse of
the drug׳s polar surface (TPSA). The oral bioavailability was
marked by small molecular weight (less than 500 Da); also, the
number of rotatable bond must be less than 10, the number of
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors must be less than 12, and
TPSA values less than 140. Table 3 (see supplementary
material) shows that all the compounds have a promising oral
bioavaibility.

Screening for the best compound based on docking and drug likeliness results:
Keeping in view of binding energies, IC50 values and ADME
parameters of the present investigated compounds it was
found that compound 21 ((2E)-3-(anthracen-9-yl)-1-
phenylprop-2-2n-1-one) has the promising anti cancer drug
like properties based on its ΔG binding energy and IC50 value.
Based on Pharmacological properties, all the twenty five
compounds showed good pharmacological attributes. These
compounds were found to comply with Lipinski׳s rule,
Veber׳s rule and oral bioavailability parameters. Whereas,
compound 21 showed good pharmacological attributes, since it
satisfied the Lipinski׳s Rule, Veber׳s Rule, Log P values with
highest binding affinity and least half inhibitory potential.

Conclusion
Our In silico studies provides a rationalization to the ability of
present studied novel twenty five compounds as a valuable
small ligand molecule with strong binding affinity towards
EGFR Kinase domain for plausible anti-cancer activity
involving large value of negative binding energy by forming
various interactions with the residues, all or some of which fall
under catalytic active site important residues consolidating
their complex׳s thermodynamic stability. Moreover, predicted
IC50 values further substantiated our hypothesis that these
compounds have the potential to inhibit EGFR Kinase domain.
The knowledge gained through this present study could be of
high value for computational screening of target specific EGFR
Kinase domain inhibitors by understanding the molecular
interaction basis between ligand and receptor. On the other
hand, promising ADME drug like profile for the present
compounds especially compound 21 substantiates the need of
further evaluating this compounds ability to inhibit cancer.
The present investigated chalcone scaffold of compounds
offers the possibility of expedient additional modifications that
could give rise to lead structures with enhanced inhibitory
activity and selectivity towards the drug receptor target like
EFGR kinase.
