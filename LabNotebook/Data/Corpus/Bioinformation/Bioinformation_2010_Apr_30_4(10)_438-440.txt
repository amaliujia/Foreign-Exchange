Background
In bacteria, one of the most studied programmed cell death (PCD)
systems is the toxin­antitoxin (TA) system. TA systems are
mechanisms that contribute to plasmid stability through death or
growth inhibition of daughter bacteria that did not receive a plasmid
copy at the cell division []. Active TA systems have been
described for a number of plasmids in a wide range of bacteria [],
and are composed of two genes organized in an operon encoding a
toxin and the corresponding antitoxin. Additionally, several TA
systems are also found on prokaryotic chromosomes, which may
have alternative regulatory functions []. ParD and ParE are
proteins of a TA system founded on plasmid RK2 with ParE being
the toxin and ParD the antitoxin. ParD, is effective in the
autoregulation of the parDE operon [] and is able to neutralize
ParE action by forming a tight inactive complex. ParE and another
currently known toxins can be subdivided into five superfamilies
called MazF, RelE, Doc, HipA and ζ, each consisting of distinct
gene families []. A sixth toxin superfamily (VapC), not yet studied,
consists of an N­terminal domain (PilT­N), also found in proteins of
the eukaryotic nonsense mediated RNA decay system []. The RelE
superfamily includes the families RelE, Yoeb, YafQ, HigB, ParE,Txe and YhaV []. 
In recent work, three new RelE­homologous,
yafNO, higBA and ygiUT, were described in E. coli []. The toxins
of the RelE superfamily are characterized by a five-stranded β-sheet
with four of the strands antiparallel to each other, while the first and
last strands are parallel. The β-sheet is flanked on one side by two
N-terminal α-helices (α1 and α 2) and on the other side by Cterminal
α-helix (α3) that, together with loop connecting β2 and β3,
forms a deep cleft that encompasses the RNase active site [].
Similar architecture has been found in genuine RNases []. In
contrast with the others RelE families, which act on RNA at the
translation level, ParE inhibits DNA replication by inactivation of
E. coli DNA gyrase, as demonstrated by the unique study available
of the ParE activity []. Despite of a common origin and significant
sequence similarity, these toxins must have had an evolutionary
divergence to acquire very distinct functional roles []. In the future,
it would be interesting to investigate the possibility of an
unexplored nuclease activity in members of the ParE family,similarly to the explored RelE cleaving ribosome­associative
activity []. As the TA systems occur in several pathogenic bacteria,
such investigations, as well as elucidation of the molecular structure
of these toxins, might be useful as a basis for the design of new and
alternative drugs []. Several crystallographic structures for
members of different bacterial toxins families are available and
these are a promise for the rational design of new class of
antibiotics. To ParE toxin, no crystallographic structure is available
so far. In this study we built a three-dimensional structure model for
ParE toxin by molecular homology modeling and the identification
of a possible active site was explored in the final Model.

Methodology
Sequence alignment
Sequence alignment was performed using CLUSTALW program.
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html). All protein
sequences were obtained into NCBI sequence database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Molecular homology modeling
The protein sequence of E. coli ParE toxin was searched by using
RK2 sequence [] (gi 420755) as query in PSI-BLAST program
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The obtained sequence (gi
194437967) was used to find template proteins through PHYRE
sever [] (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre), which is an online
tool for searching similar sequences, based on sequence and
structure­wise similarity. From the homology searching, templates
from RelE and YoeB families were selected. By having greater
identity, the protein sequence of E. coli RelE toxin was used as
template for homology modeling. A 3­D model was building
adopting an approach to comparative modeling by satisfaction of
spatial restraints using MODELLER9v7 []
(http://salilab.org/modeller). CHARMM [] energy minimization
was applied using Swiss­PdbViewer program (http://spdbv.vitalit.ch).

Analysis of the Model
The stereochemical and quality of the final models were assessed by
the PROCHECK(http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/~roman/procheck/procheck.html)
and VERIFY-3D [] (http://nihserver.mbi.ucla.edu/Verify_3D)
programs. Structural similarity search was performed using DALI
server [] (http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali_server).
Structural models were visualized by PyMol
(http://pymol.sourceforge.net).

Active sites analysis
After the final Model was built, the possible active sites of ParE
were explored applying CASTp program []
(http://sts.bioengr.uic.edu/castp).

Results and Discussion
Template identification, homology modeling and model quality
The primary structure of the E. coli ParE toxin was obtained by
subjecting the sequence of the plasmid RK2 that encodes ParE
protein (gi 420755), to the PSI­BLAST program. One sequence (gi
194437967) with 105 amino acids was selected. To find
homologous sequences with resolved three­dimensional structure,
the E. coli ParE protein sequence selected was submitted to PHYRE
server. This server allows searching similar sequences based on
sequence and structure­wise similarity []. As expected, no 3D
structure of representatives of the ParE family was matched since
there is no three­dimensional structure available to this family. The
search identified RelE and YoeB families as the best matches for
templates structures. These families belong to the same superfamily
that ParE family is included. Three templates were selected, two of
the RelE family (PDB id 1WMI and PDB id 3KHA) and one of the
Yoeb family (PDB id 2A6S). Each of the sequences templates
selected was aligned with the E. coli ParE protein sequence. By
having major identity, the E. coli RelE toxin (PDB id 3KHA) was
selected as template. Structural models were built adopting an
approach to comparative modeling by satisfaction of spatial
restraints [] using MODELLER9v7 program. The quality of the
models was assessed by the VERIFY­3D and PROCHECK
programs. Initial models did not showed good quality. Thus, the
alignment was manually modified in some points to provide better
matching in regions of secondary structure of the disrupted template
by insertions into target sequence. The modified alignment was used
to build a new model which was applied CHARMM energy
minimization using Swiss­PdbViewer program. The final model is
shown in the . Analysis using Verify3D program showed
100% of the positive score values and 90% higher than 0.2.
Ramachandram plot calculations showed 96.8% of the residues in
favored and allowed regions (). The analysis indicates
that the model has a good quality.

Structure and active sites analysis
Toxins of the RelE superfamily are characterized by a core of the
five-stranded β-sheet, with four of the strands antiparallel each
other, while the first and last strands are positioned parallel. The
core of β-sheets is flanked on one side by two N-terminal α-helixes
and on the other side by one C-terminal α-helix which together with
the loop connecting β2 and β3, forms a deep cleft that encompasses
the RNase active site []. As the E. coli RelE toxin [] was
employed as template in molecular modeling, the proposed Model
for E.coli ParE protein showed a similar molecular structure that
which characterizes the RelE superfamily: a core of the fourstranded
β-sheets flanked by three α-helixes (two N-terminal and
one C-terminal). The atomic coordinates of the Model was
submitted to Dali server which is a network service for comparing
of a queried protein structure with structures deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) []. In this structural similarity search, RelE toxin from E. coli (Z score = 17.9), mutant (R81A/R83A)
RelE toxin [] from E. coli (Z score = 15.3), RelE toxin from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Z score = 9.8), YoeB toxin [] from
E. coli (Z score = 9.6) and RelE toxin [] from Pyrococcus
horikoshii (Z score = 9.2) were identified as the best matches. As
reported to other members of the RelE superfamily [,], the
proposed Model also showed structural similarities, but with small
Z score, for other microbial ribonucleases such as colicin-E5 []
from E. coli (Z score = 3.7), RNase SA3 [] from Streptomyces
aureofaciens (Z score = 3.6) and RNase SA [] from Streptomyces
aureofaciens (Z score = 3.4). The Model predicted for E. coli ParE
toxin was also submitted to CASTp program to identify accessible
surface pockets and/or cavities. The analysis identified several
cavities including one formed exactly in region delimited by Cterminal
α-helix (α3) and the loop connecting α2 and β2 which is
indicate as a possible deep cleft that encompasses the RNase active
site in the template protein ().

Conclusions
A satisfactory Model for ParE toxin from E. coli was obtained by
adopting of an approach to comparative modeling with satisfaction
of spatial restraints []. This model shows a similar architecture for
the general structure of the RelE superfamily. Structural similarity
search, using atomic coordinates of the obtained Model as query,
showed best matches with RelE and YoeB families, as well as with
others microbial ribonucleases, but with small score. A surface
topography analysis identified a cavity formed by the region
delimited by the C-terminal α-helix (α3) and the loop connecting α2
and β2 sheets, which is indicate as a possible RNase active site for
RelE superfamily. However, no reports on nuclease activity for
ParE toxin is available at the moment and only one study describes
the bacterial DNA gyrase as the intracellular target of this toxin [].
Would be interesting additional studies to investigate the possibility
of a DNA or RNA-cleaving activity by members of the ParE family.
Moreover, new studies are necessary to confirm the ParE inhibitory
replication activity as well as to establish a mechanism for its
action. The Model presented here allows initial inferences about the
structure of the ParE toxin and will allow the rational design of
peptide derivatives for structure-function studies, as reported to
Ccdb toxin [].
