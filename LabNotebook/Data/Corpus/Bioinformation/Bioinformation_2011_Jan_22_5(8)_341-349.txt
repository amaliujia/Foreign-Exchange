Background
Nudix (nucleoside phosphatase linked to x) enzymes are found in several 
diverse types of organisms such as viruses [], 
bacteria [] archaea 
[], and 
eukaryotes  []. They catalyze the hydrolysis of nucleoside and 
deoxynucleoside triophosphate attached functional groups or chemical 
species, referred to as x [,
]. Nudix enzymes remove mutation inducing 
nucleotide such as 8-oxy-dGTP from  the cell, which tends to interfere 
DNA replication process causing several thousand fold increase in AT-CG 
transversion mutation rate  []. In addition, these enzymes catalyze the 
catabolism of cellular toxic compounds so that their cytotoxic effects on 
the bacterial cell can be removed [–
]. Thus, the Nudix enzymes perform 
a key role in protecting the cells from oxidative damage by radiation and 
from toxic effects of accumulated metabolites  [–]. Moreover, these 
enzymes are implicated in cell signaling [–], maintaining the level of 
signaling compounds inside the cell []. Due to their protective roles in cell 
survival, the Nudix enzymes can be potential targets for antimicrobial 
drugs in pathogenic organisms such as African Swine Fever Virus  [],
Streprococcus pneumonia  and Enterococcus faecalis. These enzymes are 
characterized by a highly conserved Nudix box sequence motif 
G-X(5)-EX(7)-R-E-U-X-E-E-X-G-U, where the conserved residues are separated 
by X (any residues) and U, a bulky hydrophobic residue.  The Nudix box 
acts as a catalytic centre  [] and is often found in loop-alpha-helix-loop 
[].

Due to key role of Nudix enzymes in bacterial cell survival, we targeted 
these enzymes from pathogenic microorganisms such as  Streprococcus 
pneumonia  (2B06) and Enterococcus faecalis  (2AZW) for the functional
sites, substrates and inhibitors prediction. Their structures have been 
determined and submitted in RCSB protein data bank. However, no data 
has been reported about their functional sites, substrates and inhibitors. 
Although, several biochemical techniques have been used to predict the 
functional sites, however, these techniques are time consuming and not 
cost effective. Therefore, we used  combined computational approach of 
Geometric Invariant (GI) and Molecular docking methods for functional 
sites, substrates and inhibitor prediction in Nudix enzymes 2B06 and 
2AZW.

Methodology
Input files
Dataset creation
We obtained structures of Nudix enzymes, 2B06 and 2AZW, from RCSB 
protein data bank. Then, these structures were further subjected to 
Geometric Invariant calculator and  enumerated putative substructures 
(amino acid patterns of 4-6 residues obtained from whole protein 
structures) based on their geometric properties such as area, volume, and 
perimeter. Please refer the following paper for detail of GI method [,
] 
(Table 1 See ).

Library of functional sites
The library of functional sites was constructed using 10751 non-redundant 
proteins from the PDB as available in level 2 of NCBI's molecular 
modeling database (MMDB). It contains 959 clusters of amino acid 
patterns of size 4-6 residues covering 136 GO terms. Each substructure is 
described with a number of descriptors that are invariant upon rotation and 
translation transformations and hence are called as geometric invariant 
(GIs). For instance, we used 27, 45 and 72 descriptors to represent four, 
five and six sized substructures. The example descriptors are distance 
between two vertices, perimeter, volume, and surface area of geometric 
objects [].

Comparison of functional sites
The substructures from 2B06 and 2AZW were compared with the library 
of functional sites reported earlier and having compatible amino acid 
composition. The geometric similarity between a certain substructure and 
the site leads to declaration of that substructure as a putative functional site 
(Table 5 see ) 
[].

Substrate prediction
We used molecular docking method for prediction of substrates and their 
binding sites in 2B06 and 2AZW.  The substrates were selected from pdb 
files and literature of the template proteins present in the matched cluster 
(from GI method). The SMILES strings of substrates were obtained from 
PUBCHEM database (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and converted in 
to 3D via using CORINA server (www.molecular-networks.com/ online_demos/corina_demo.html). The substrates were docked against the 
Nudix target 2B06 and 2AZW in two settings: Blind docking and Refined docking. The blind docking considers the whole structure of the 
Nudix enzymes as docking target,  while in refined docking, we specifies the functional sites ( predicted by our GI method) as docking target and 
generates the grid map with grid  points spacing at 0.375A. The docking experiments were performed via using 
AUTODOCK4.0 []. All docking 
parameters were set to be default ().

Binding site analysis
The substrates were ranked based on the lowest docking energy of the 
blind docking by including residues with in 6A° radius from the substrate 
(as center).

Inhibitor Prediction
The inhibitor compounds for the 2B06 and 2AZW Nudix enzymes were 
obtained from the literature and searched in the PUBCHEM database for 
finding of similar compounds. The SMILES strings of all the inhibitor 
compounds were downloaded and converted in to 3D structures via 
CORINA server. The compounds were further docked against the whole 
structures of 2B06 and 2AZW via PATCHDOCK software [] and ranked 
based on the Docking score.  Top ranked inhibitor compound was selected 
for analysis of drug likeness properties via MOLINSPIRATION server 
(www.molinspiration.com).

Results
We divided our research work results in three parts: Functional site prediction in 2B06 and 2AZW, Substrates prediction and 
Inhibitor prediction. Here we described the details of our predictions:

Functional site prediction
Nudix enzymes from Streptococcus pneumoniae (2B06) and Enterococcus faecalis (2AZW)
Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a gram-positive anaerobic 
bacterium from genus Streptococcus. It causes bacterial meningitis in both 
adults and childre. It also causes  various pneumococcal infections like 
acute sinusitis, otitis media, sepsis, endocarditis etc. On the other hand, the 
Enterococcus faecalis is a gram positive facultative anaerobic bacterium 
homing gastrointestinal tracts of human. It causes sever infections such as 
endocarditis as well as infections in gal bladder, prostate and epididymal 
surface in Humans. The Nudix enzymes 2B06 and 2AZW may participate 
in the cell survival of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis 
bacteria's in adverse environment.

We predicted following functional sites in the 2B06: RA57, EA58, EA61, 
EA62 and 2AZW: RA62, EA63, EA66, EA67 Nudix enzymes via GI 
method based on a match with cluster DDDK-1 in the library. The cluster 
DDDK-1 contains functional sites of four known Nudix enzymes: 
(1) MutT Nudix from Caenorhabditis elegans (1KTG: E.C.3.6.1.17: RA51, EA52,EA55, EA56),
(2) Nudix enzyme from Escherichia coli (1VHZ: E.C.3.6.1: RA94, EA95, EA98, EA99) and (3) Nudix enzyme from Deinococcus radiodurans  
(1NQZ: E.C.3.6.1.9: RA85 EA86 EA89 EA90 and 1SU2: RA64 EA65 EA68 EA69)  (Table 1 see ). All 
these template proteins are known to perform Hydrolase activities.  Note 
that the 2B06 and 2AZW Nudix enzymes share very low sequence identity 
(less than 25%) with the template proteins.  The predicted sites share the 
following sequence pattern: R-X-E-X  (3)-E-X-E and are present in the 
Nudix box motif.

We also analyzed performance of the state of art methods for functional 
sites predictions in 2B06 and 2AZW Nudix enzymes. The sequence 
(BLAST) and structure (DALI) comparison of the Nudix targets against 
known proteins in the PDB database strongly establish homology with our 
template proteins of the cluster DDDK-1. PROSITE  server detects Nudix 
hydrolase signature motif: G-x(5)-E-x(4)-[TAGCV]
-[LIVMACF]-x-R-[EL]-[LIVMFGSTA]
-x-[EA]-E-x-[GNDTHR]
 (PS:00893) for 2AZW and 2B06. However, the PINTS and CSA are unable to predict functional sites 
in these Nudix proteins. PROFUNC and PatchFinder, on the other hand, 
predicted functional sites in all the  SG targets with varying degree of 
confidences as well as with large number of residues match (Table 2 see 
). These results are in  agreement with residues 
from GI method.

Substrate prediction
The docking of the substrates against whole structures of 2B06 and 2AZW 
revealed that the substrate, ADP-Ribose binds the Nudix enzymes in their 
cavities with the lower docking energies of -15.68 Kcal/mol (2B06) 
() and -10.86 Kcal/mol (2AZW) 
() as compared to 
other substrates (Table 3 see ). 

When we performed refined docking of the ADP-Ribose against putative 
functional sites of 2B06 and 2AZW (predicted by GI method), we  able to 
obtain lower docking energies of -16.20 Kcal/mol (2B06) and -10.96 
Kcal/mol (2AZW) than that of blind docking (Table 3 see 
). 
The docking analysis established the fact that ADP-Ribose is 
the most preferred substrate for 2B06 and 2AZW Nudix enzymes. We 
observed that ADP-Ribose binds the targets 2B06 and 2AZW in their 
cavities made up of active site residues predicted by our GI method. The 
amino acid residue EA62 in 2B06  and RA62 in 2AZW makes hydrogen 
bond with the substrate ADP-Ribose ().

Substrate binding site analysis
We found that the residues, T10, I12, N26, R28, W35, P41, G42, G43, 
H44, RA57, EA58, E62, KS76, W78, YR86, V88, E105, A122, Y123, 
D124, L128, Y142 and W150 present in the binding cavity of 2B06 
surrounding the substrate ADP-Ribose within 6A° radius.  On the other 
hand, in case of 2AZW, the following residues are surrounding ADPRibose substrate with in 6A°
 radius: GA7, RA18, NA40,  FA44, GA48, 
EA49,  EA51, RA62, EA63, EA66, EA67, EA83, YA84, FA85, YA86, 
SA87, HA89, RA90, KA132, RA133, GA134 and RA137.

Functional mechanism
We propose the following functional mechanism for 2B06: One of the 
catalytic residues, RA57, may form a hydrogen bond interaction with the 
nearest water molecules. The two  glutamate residues, EA58 and EA61, 
may be involved in making coordination complex with a magnesium ion. 
Additionally, these glutamate residues may make hydrogen bonds with 
surrounding water molecules (W403, W373 and W304), while the water 
molecule, W318, may share a hydrogen bond with EA58 and EA62 
(). On the other hand, in 2AZW: We found that the residues 
RA62 and EA63 are very close to magnesium ion and may form a 
coordination complex. These residues make hydrogen bonds with the 
nearest water molecules. For instance, RA62 makes a hydrogen bond with 
W314, while EA63 makes a hydrogen bond with W275. Similarly, the 
glutamate residue, EA66, makes hydrogen bonds with two nearest water 
molecules W204 and W336. The water molecule W259 shares a hydrogen 
bond between residues RA62 and EA63 ().

Inhibitor prediction
Docking of 51 inhibitor compounds revealed that the compounds 
AMPCPR and CID14258187 show more affinity for the 2B06 and 2AZW 
as compared to other inhibitor compounds. The compound AMPCPR  is 
produced Patchdock score of 5292 and CID14258187 of 4888 in case of 
2B06, which is higher than other compounds () (Table 6 see 
) On the other hand for 2AZW, AMPCPR 
produced score of 4902 and CID14258187 of 4268 (). The 
compounds AMPCPR and CID14258187 bind within the binding site 
pockets of these Nudix enzymes and surround by RA57, EA62 ,EA58 
(2B06) and RA62, EA63, EA66, EA67 (2AZW) binding sites residues 
(). Furthermore, drug likeness properties analyses revealed that 
the compound CID14258187 shows no violation for the Lipinski rule of 5 
(rules for selecting a compound as a potential drug)  (Table 4 see 
). On the other hand, the compound AMPCPR is 
not in agreement of rule of 5  (Table 4 see ).
Therefore, we predict CID14258187 (2R, 3R, 4S, 5R)-2-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)-5-(dichlorophosphoryloxymethyl) oxolane-3, 4-diol) as potential 
inhibitor of the Nudix enzymes 2B06 and 2AZW.

Discussion
In this work, we predict functional sites, substrates and inhibitors for 2B06 
and 2AZW Nudix enzymes from disease causing micro-organisms such as 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. These enzymes may 
act as potential drug targets in these micro-organisms because of their key 
roles in cell survival. Their structures are already reported, however 
functional sites and substrates are still unknown. Therefore, we target these 
enzymes for our computational study. We report functional sites in these 
Nudix enzymes via GI method. Our predicted sites are also matching with 
the residues detected by PROFUNC and Patchfinder servers. However, 
these servers produced large number of amino acid residues.

Furthermore, we also determine the substrate for the 2AZW and 2B06 via 
docking study. We find that the substrate ADP-Ribose shows more affinity 
for these Nudix enzymes as well as the residues EA62 (2B06) and RA62 
(2AZW) interact with the ADP-ribose by making the hydrogen bonds. 
Note that these residues are also report by our GI method.  The residues in 
the predicted sites for 2B06 and 2AZW are also make hydrogen bonds with 
nearby water molecules, leading to  more convincing specificity of our 
functional site prediction. In addition, we determine the inhibitor 
compounds for these Nudix enzymes via docking.  Our study finds that the 
compounds AMPCPR and CID14258187 may act as potential inhibitors of 
2B06 and 2AZW. These compounds also bind within the same binding site 
pockets and residues of these Nudix enzymes, as shared by the substrate 
ADP-Ribose. In addition, the drug likeness properties analysis reveal that 
the compound CID14258187 (2R, 3R, 4S, 5R)-2-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)-5-(dichlorophosphoryloxymethyl) oxolane-3, 4-diol) is in agreement with 
Lipinski rule of 5 and can be act as potential drug against Streptococcus 
pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis pathogenic microorganisms.

Conclusion
Our work concludes that the functional site residues predicted by GI 
method are putative substrate binding site residues for Nudix enzymes 
2B06 and 2AZW. We also find that ADP-Ribose is their substrate, which 
infer that these Nudix enzymes may  catalyze the catabolic reaction of 
ADP-Ribose in to AMP.  Our study also determines that the AMPCPR and 
CID14258187 may act as inhibitor compounds for these Nudix enzymes. 
As these Nudix enzymes are from pathogenic microorganisms 
Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Enterococcus faecalis, therefore these 
inhibitor compounds can be used as drug compound against these 
microorganisms. Analysis of drug likeness properties also confirm that the 
compound CID14258187 (2R, 3R, 4S, 5R)-2-(6-aminopurin-9-yl)-5-
(dichlorophosphoryloxymethyl) oxolane-3,4-diol) is capable to act as 
potential drug compound. These studies may help in designing new drugs 
against  Streptococcus pneumoniae  and Enterococcus faecalis. This is the 
most important contribution of this work given that the Nudix enzymes are 
potentially important drug targets due to their key role in these organisms 
survival.
