Background
The importance of miRNA studies is steadily increasing over
two decades []. It is known that many miRNAs regulate the
expression of genes involved intumourigenesis 
[–]. For
example, changes in miRNA concentrations have
beenobserved during the development of lung cancer 
[],
breast cancer [] andother cancers 
[]. It has been proposed
that miRNA binding to mRNAs occurs mainly in the 3'UTRs of
mRNAs []. However, it has been shown, that miRNAbinding
sites can be located in 5'UTR and CDS of several mRNAs 
[,
].
Therefore, it is importance to document a comprehensive
study on miRNAusing available data in the public domain.
Hence, we studied miR-3960 withpreferential binding to 5'UTR
and CDS of several genes. Most of these genesare involved in
the development of cancer; therefore, it is necessary toidentify
the features for miRNA binding sites. Identification of
newinteractions with miR-3960 in mRNAs will increase our
understanding of thepost-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression.

Methodology
Sequence dataset:
The complete nucleotide sequences of precursor mRNAs (premRNAs)
of human genes were downloaded from NCBI
GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) in FASTA format.
The nucleotide sequences of human mature miR-3960 were
downloaded from the miRBase database (http://mirbase.org)
[].

Sequence Analysis:
Nucleotide sequences of pre-mRNAs were shorten into mature
mRNA sequences by Lextractor002 script (http:// sites.
google.com/site/malaheenee/software). This script create file
with mRNA sequence and indicate its bounds between 5'UTR,
CDS, and 3'UTR according Genbank information about each
gene.

Target prediction using MirTarget program:
The target genes for the tested miRNAs were identified using
the MirTarget program, which was developed in our
laboratory. The workflows to scanning mirna are shown in
( &amp; )

This program defines the following features of binding sites: a)
the start point of an miRNA binding site in mRNA; b) the
localization of miRNA binding sites in the 5'-untranslated
region (5'UTR), coding domain sequence (CDS) and 3'UTR of
the mRNAs; c) the free energy of hybridization (ΔG, kJ/mole);
and d) the schemes of nucleotide interactions between the
miRNAs and the mRNAs. The ΔG/ΔGm (%) ratio was counted
for each site, where ΔGm equalled the free energy of a miRNA
binding with its perfect complementary nucleotide sequence.
The miRNA binding sites located on the mRNAs had ΔG/ΔGm
ratios of 90% or more. We also noted the position of the
binding sites on the mRNA, beginning from the first
nucleotide of the mRNA's 5' UTR. The MirTarget program
computed the interactions between the nucleotides of the
miRNA and those of the target gene mRNAs. It was found that
there are hydrogen bonds between adenine (A) and uracil (U),
guanine (G) and cytosine (C), and G and U, as well as between
A and C []. The distance between A and C was equal to the GC,
A-U, and G-U distances []. The numbers of hydrogen
bonds in the G-C, A-U, G-U and A-C interactions were found
to be 3, 2, 1 and 1, respectively. The free binding energies of
these nucleotide pairs were accepted as the same values
(3:2:1:1).

Results
Features of miR-3960 binding with mRNAs target genes:
miR-3960 is in an exon of the cyclin-dependent kinase 9 gene,
located on chromosome 9. miR-3960 has a length of 20 nt and a
GC-content of 96%. The maximum free energy of miR-3960
binding to mRNA is -125.3 kJ/mole. We found that miR-3960
has 1100 binding sites on 375 target mRNAs with ΔG/ΔGm
values of 90% or more. Of those, 20 miR-3960 binding sites are
located in 3'UTRs, 565 sites are located in 5'UTRs and 515 sites
are located in CDSs. miR-3960 has 19 binding sites in the
mRNA of the RHOT1 gene, 18 binding sites in the mRNAs of
the AFF2 and KIF3B genes, 16 binding sites in the 5'UTRs of the
mRNAs of the DAZAP1 and BCL2L11 genes and 14 binding
sites in the CDSs of the mRNA of the BTBD2 gene.
Approximately half of miR-3960 binding sites are located in
the protein-coding regions of mRNAs. The ΔG/ΔGm value for
all miR-3960 binding sites in the mRNA of target genes is more
than 90% and is 98.2% for the mRNAs of the ADRB1, CEBPB,
RANBP9 and SKOR2 genes. The nucleotide sequences of the
miR-3960 binding sites in the CDSs of 47 genes are shown in
. The binding sites are clearly conserved as indicated
by comparing them with the adjacent nucleotide sequences of
the CDSs.

The characteristics of the mRNA binding sites of miR-3960 in
several genes are shown in  (see supplementary
material). The presence of several miR-3960 binding sites
within a single mRNA increases the probability that miR-3960
will bind to the mRNA and increases its ability to inhibit
protein synthesis. The oligonucleotide sequences of the
binding sites located in CDSs encode for oligopeptides
containing mainly alanine or proline depending on the reading
frame . These data indicate the importance of
preserving the nucleotide sequences of the miR-3960 binding
sites but not the amino acid sequences of the oligopeptides in
the encoded protein. The mRNAs of some target genes have
miR-3960 binding sites located with an interval of one, two or
three nucleotides. 73 out of 2109 genes of transcription factors
are targets for miR-3960. For example, the ZIC5 gene encodes a
transcription factor, and its mRNA has 12 miR-3960 binding
sites located through one or two nucleotides. Consequently,
the probability of miR-3960 binding with the ZIC5 mRNA is
high. The miR-3960 binding sites in the ZIC5 mRNA encode an
oligopeptide predominantly composed of proline. The mRNA
of several genes also have conserved nucleotide sequences at
their miR-3960 binding sites in comparison with the amino
acid composition of the corresponding oligopeptides. Thus, the
oligonucleotides of the miR-3960 binding sites encode for
oligopeptides with different amino acid sequences, as shown
in  (see supplementary material).

Many target genes contain miR-3960 binding sites in the
5'UTRs of their mRNAs; this includes 565 binding sites. This
localisation of miR-3960 binding sites allows miR-3960 to
decrease the protein synthesis of those genes. The nucleotide
sequences of miR-3960 binding sites in the 5'UTRs of mRNAs
of target genes are highly conserved. mRNAs of many genes
have miR-3960 binding sites in their 5'UTRs with displacement
in one, two or three nucleotides. The number of the miR-3960
binding sites varied from five to 18. The ΔG/ΔGm value of the
miR-3960 binding sites varied from 91.5% to 96.6% and
corresponded to a high degree of interaction between the
miRNAs with the mRNAs. miR-3960 binding sites are located
predominantly in the 5'UTRs and CDSs of the studied mRNAs,
and only 1.8% of the binding sites are in 3'UTRs. The miR-3960
binding sites of the mRNA of ten genes were spaced two or
three nucleotides apart. miR-3960 binding sites are located in
the 5'UTRs, CDSs and 3'UTRs of mRNAs. The 3'UTRs of the
mRNAs of several genes have high homology to miR-3960
binding sites.

Discussion
The average GC-content value in 5'UTRs and CDSs is known
to be higher than that in 3'UTRs. Retaining the nucleotide
sequence of miRNA binding sites within the high GC-content
in the 3'UTR is difficult because of the involvement of the
3'UTR in the formation of the 2 and 3 dimensional structures of
mRNAs. The presence of a complementary binding site of the
same length is necessary for the generation of stable secondary
and tertiary mRNA structures. A high GC-content in the
miRNA binding site promotes its presence on the surface of
the 3D-structure of the mRNA because G and C nucleotides
are more hydrophilic than A and U nucleotides. Thus, the
probability of miRNAs binding to regions of 5'UTRs and CDSs
with high GC-content is higher than the probability of
miRNAs binding to regions of 3'UTRs [].

Another way to increase the probability of miRNA binding to
mRNA is increasing the number of sites in each mRNA. For
example, miR-3960 has multiple binding sites in the 5'UTRs
and CDSs of many genes. It is difficult to conserve the multiple
independent miRNA binding sites in these regions; therefore,
it is easier to increase the probability of miRNA binding by
creating multiple binding sites located side by side. This was
the case for the miR-3960 binding sites in the 5'UTRs and CDSs
of many studied mRNAs  (see supplementary
material).

We propose that the localisation of miRNA binding sites to
5'UTRs and CDSs will aid in the termination of protein
synthesis. Such localisation saves the cell time and energy
compared to translation inhibition in the case of localisation of
miRNA binding sites to 3'UTRs. The results of the present
study showed that in most cases miRNA binding sites located
in CDSs are near the start codon.

Unfortunately, there is not sufficient experimental verification
of the formation of miR-3960 binding sites. However, available
data confirm the high predictive power of our developed
program. For example, the overexpression of miR-3960
promotes BMP2-induced osteoblastogenesis. The miR-
2861~miR-3960 cluster was found to be associated with bone
homeostasis induced by BMP2-Runx2 []. Chatterjee et al.
showed that miR-3960 has a binding site in the mRNA of the
Hoxa2 gene, which is a repressor of Runx2 gene expression
[]. Some target genes of miR-3960 encode transcription
factors: SKOR2, PRDM12, FOXF2, FOXE1, BTBD2, AFF2,
ZSWIM6, ZNF219, ZNF703, TRIM67 and RANBP9. Inhibition
of the translation of the corresponding proteins causes many
pathologies, including tumourigenesis. For example, miR-3960
can supress BCL11A gene expression resulting in the
development of lymphoma []. Alterations in the gene
expression of CDH3 and NDRG3 have been observed in
colorectal and prostate cancer [–
]. The observed changes in
expression of these genes were most likely due to the action of
miR-3960 on their mRNAs.

Conclusion
In this study, we have shown that miR-3960 has 1100 binding
sites on 375 target mRNAs with ΔG/ΔGm values of 90% or
more. miR-3960 binding sites are located predominantly in the
5'UTRs and CDSs of the studied mRNAs. Another feature of
this miRNA is the presence of multiple binding sites in the
mRNA of its target genes. Dysregulation of miR-3960
expression can lead to cancer, because of presence great
number of target genes with high affinity of the binding sites.
Therefore the study is important for creation of diagnostic
methods of cancer.
