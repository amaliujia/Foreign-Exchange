Background
Influenza viruses belong to the member of orthomyxo-viridae family,
                                having a single-standard, negative sense, segmented RNA genome in an
                                enveloped virion [-]. The genome of influenza viruses have 8 RNA
                                segments encoding 10 proteins including two surface glycoprotein,
                                haemaggulutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), nucleoproteins (NP), three
                                polymerase proteins (PA,PB1,PB2) two matrix (M1,M2) and
                                nonstructural proteins (NS1,NS2). Influenza viruses are classified
                                as types A, B and C based on the antigenic properties of
                                nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M1) [,]. Avian
                                influenza is caused by a type-A virus and it is further classified
                                into subtype based on two surface glycoprotein, haemagglutinin (HA)
                                and neuraminidase (NA). There are about 16 known HA and 9 known NA
                                in type-A viruses [].

Viral genes from the aquatic bird are thought to be the source of all
                                influenza-A viruses in other animal species []. Recently,
                                subtypes H5N1, H9N2, H7N7 of influenza A have been identified in
                                humans, raising the possibility of a new influenza pandemic among
                                the uninfected populations. Avian influenza viruses are categorized
                                as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic avian
                                influenza (LPAI) viruses based on virulence. The HPAI virus causes
                                systemic lethal infection and can kill birds within 24 hours of
                                post-infection. However, the LPAI viruses show rare outbreak of
                                pandemics. Therefore, their morbidity and mortality rates are low
                                        []. Surveillance of live poultry in December
                                1997 revealed that 4% of infected poultry was caused by
                                H9N2 subtype [,]. 

The polymerase protein PB2 is 759 residues long influenza-A viruses. The
                                polymerase complex is formed protein subunit interactions with the
                                PB1 subunit []. PB2 interacts with NP and not with PA
                                        [,]. This subunit plays an important role in
                                transcription of mRNA by binding with the 5’ methylated cap of
                                pre-mRNA in host cells for providing primers to viral mRNA synthesis
                                        []. Two hypothetical domains (residues 242-280
                                and 538-577) identified in PB2 are hypothesized for viral binding to
                                host cells []. Here, we describe the effect of mutations
                                in PB2 from different strains of H9N2. The analysis is extended to
                                that in H5N1 for comparison.

Methodology
Data set
The PB2 protein sequences of subtypes H5N1 and H9N2 were
                                        downloaded from Genome directory INFLUENZA at NCBI
                                                [] and summary of sequence data given
                                        in Table 1 (see )). The
                                        dataset consists of PB2 sequences from 3 H9N2 strains and 2
                                        H5N1 strains. We used CLUSTALW [] for
                                        generating a multiple sequence alignment MSA of 5 PB2
                                        sequences from H9N2 strains and H5N1 strains.

Mutational analyses
The MSA for 5 PB2 sequences from H9N2 strains and H5N1 strains
                                        was used to identify mutations in PB2 with reference to
                                        Ck/UP/India/04. We used the amino acids sequences 151 to 690
                                        for the analyses.

Secondary structure prediction
We used GOR IV to assign secondary structures to PB2 sequences
                                                [].

Domains/motifs search
We used PROSITE scan at the EXPASY to identify PROSITE motifs in
                                        PB2 proteins [].

Results
Sequence analyses
The PB2 protein sequence of A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04(H9N2) isolate
                                        was compared with other homologous sequences as were given
                                        in Table 1 (see )). The PB2
                                        protein sequences obtained from GenBank have at least
                                        97% similarity among themselves and a multiple
                                        sequence alignment is obtained using the software ClustalW
                                                ().
                                        Mutations are summarized in Table 2 (under )) with changes in
                                        corresponding predicted secondary structures.

On comparing the data we found that all the mutations except
                                        340(R→K) and 478(V→I) in A/goose/MN/5733-1/80(H9N2), and
                                        667(V→I) in A/HK/213/03(H5N1). All the mutations that were
                                        observed are synonymous and will not change the chemical and
                                        structure properties of this protein. Only one non
                                        synonymous mutation, M294T in Ck/UP/2543/India was found to
                                        change the chemical property from Hydrophobic to Hydrophilic
                                        at the respective site. The most important finding,
                                        observed, was the identification of N-myristoylation domain.
                                        This domain (GGvrTV) was found at positions 290-295 due to
                                        mutation at 294 (M→T) in A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04 (H9N2) as
                                        shown in Table 3 ()). Moreover,
                                        mutations at position N265S and M570I in
                                        A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04(H9N2) were observed in binding regions
                                        of PB2 protein.

Secondary structure prediction
Secondary structure changes due to mutations were also found.
                                        Mutations, M294T in Ck/UP/2543/India/04 and I478V in
                                        Gs/Mn/5733-1/80 responsible for change in secondary
                                        structure from helix to strand, mutation M570I in U.P
                                        isolate altered the secondary structure form strand to helix
                                        (Table 2 in )). No other
                                        significant difference in the predicted regions in all the
                                        sequences were observed except in
                                        A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04(H9N2) strain, region 293 to 298 was
                                        predicted to be extended strand while all the other selected
                                        strains have helix at this position and region 569 to 574
                                        was predicted to be helix while all the other strains have
                                        extended strand at this position.

Domain/Motif search
Different domains/Motifs that were found in PB2 protein of
                                        A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04 (H9N2) were listed in Table 3 (under
                                                )). One of the most
                                        important finding that we observed was the identification of
                                        a new N-myristoylaton domain at position 290-295 in
                                        A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04(H9N2). This domain was found due to
                                        mutation at M294T. Amino acids (290-295) code for a new
                                        N-myristoylation domain (GGvrTV).

Sequence alignment
Amino acid sequences of PB2 protein of H9N2 and H5N1 subtypes
                                        were aligned by using ClustalW program. Sequence analyses of
                                        PB2 protein (AA from 151 to 690) of H9N2 and H5N1 isolates
                                        revealed that PB2 protein of these two subtypes were similar
                                        by 97% (). 

Discussion
PB2 protein is 759 amino acids long segment on the influenza A genome.
                                This subunit bind to the 5′methyelated cap of pre-mRNA
                                of host cells, before they cleaved to provide primers for viral mRNA
                                synthesis. Honda, et al showed that two domains (residues, 242-280
                                and 538-577) were identified as a binding region in PB2 protein.
                                These binding regions are conserved among different subtypes. Our
                                analyses showed that mutations (N265S and M570I) were identified in
                                biding region of PB2 of Ck/UP/2543/India/04(H9N2) isolate. The most
                                important finding that we observed was identification of a new
                                N-myristoylation domain found at position 290-295 in
                                A/Ck/UP/2543/India/04(H9N2). It is post translation domain, plays a
                                vital role in membrane targeting and signal transduction.
                                N-myristoylation domain is found in higher eukaryotes, fungi and
                                viruses which are formed as a result of post-translation protein
                                modification. In myristoylation domain, myristic acid is covalently
                                attached via an amide bond to the alpha-amino group of a glycine
                                residue at N-terminal. This modification is catalyzed by N-myristoyl
                                transferase enzyme. It plays a vital role in membrane targeting and
                                signal transduction []. Myristoylation have ability to influence
                                the conformational stability of individual proteins. Moreover, it
                                also interacts with membranes or the hydrophobic domains of other
                                proteins [].

This study also revealed that the change in secondary structure occurred,
                                is due to mutations as discussed in Table 2 ()). These mutations not only change the
                                secondary structure conformation at the respective site but also
                                alter the nearest side chain conformation as predicted by GORIV
                                methods. Sequence of PB2 protein of these two subtypes was showing
                                similarity () among
                                each other, raising the possibility that exchange of internal
                                segments between these two subtypes have been occurred
                                        [,].

Conclusion
The PB2 subunit plays an important role in transcription regulation in
                                viral mRNA synthesis. We showed mutational difference in PB2 in
                                different strains of H9N2. Mutations are seen in the predicted
                                secondary structures of PB2. These findings have implications in
                                understating PB2 function in viral multiplication and infection.
