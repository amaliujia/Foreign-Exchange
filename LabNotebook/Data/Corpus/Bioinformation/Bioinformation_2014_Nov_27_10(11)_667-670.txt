Background
Diaper dermatitis is one of the most common forms of 
dermatitis in neonates [], comprising 10-20% of dermatological 
problems in America with a prevalence of 7-35% in infants 
[,
]. 
The peak age for this complication is 6-12 months []. It can 
be primarily caused by diapers, increased skin pH, zinc 
deficiency, prolonged exposure to humidity, and feces and 
urine-induced irritation []. If dermatitis continues for more 
than three days, secondary infections such as Candida will 
occur []. As the name implies, diaper dermatitis occurs more 
frequently in diaper-covered areas []. Dermatitis caused by 
Candida species can be diagnosed clinically as well as by 
culture []. Topical anti-fungals such as nystatin, clotrimazole, 
miconazole, and ketoconazole are used to treat daiper 
dermatitis []. Oral candidiasis is a local infection observed in 
infants and patients taking antibiotics, head and neck 
chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or immunocompromised 
individuals and those using inhalational corticosteroids [,
].
The most common cause of oral candidiasis is Candida albicans 
[] and diagnosis is mostly done clinically 
[]. However, 
preparing cultures from the lesions using gram staining or 
KOH can also be used as a diagnostic method []. Azoles such 
as fluconazole and itraconazole can be used for treatment. It 
has been shown that posaconazole is also effective in case of 
oral candidiasis [], and nystatin is also used for treating mild 
forms this infection []. A previous study showed that
clotrimazole and fluconazole had the same effectiveness while 
nystatin had less []. The objective of this study was to assess 
susceptibility of Candida species to common antifungals used 
in the case of oral candidiasis and diaper dermatitis.

Methodology
Patients:
In this experimental study, samples from oral candidiasis and 
diaper dermatitis lesions were collected from children referring 
to private and public clinics in Ilam, Iran, using a census 
method during 2012. The patients׳ demographic chractristcs 
were collected using a researcher-made questionnaire with 
confirmed reliability.

Sample collection:
Samples were obtained using sterile swabs during routine visits 
when oral candidiasis and diaper dermatitis lesions were 
clinically identified. We included patients who had not 
received antifungal treatment for the past three days in order to 
prevent false negative cases. The samples were put in distilled 
water and transferred to the laboratory. There the samples were 
incubated at 37°C for 48-72 hours on subouraud dextrose agar 
culture media, and then the cultured plates were evaluated. 
First, slides were prepared of the cultured colonies. In the case 
of finding yeast cells, the Candida species were identified by 
standard methods and the species were divided to groups; C. 
albicans and non-C. albicans [,
].

Antifungal susceptibility testing:
The antifungal susceptibility was determined based on the 
reference method M44-A suggested by the Clinical and 
Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) []. The Candida albicans 
strain ATCC 2091 as standard strain was used. The isolates 
were subcultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) and
incubated at 37°C overnight. Saline suspension of the organism 
was made and the turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 Mc Farland 
standards. The disks were placed on the media and the plates 
were incubated at 37°C. The zone of inhibition was recorded 
after 24 hours and 48 hours.We used nystatin 100 unit/disk, 
fluconazole 10 µg/disk, itraconazole 10µg/disk, ketoconazole 
10µg/disk, amphotericinB 20µg/disk, clotrimazole 10µg/disk, 
posaconazole 5µg/disk, and voriconazole 1µg/disk (Sigma 
Aldrich, USA) [].

Statical analysis:
Data were analyzed using SPSS software, version 16. Chi-square and T test 
student were used as appropriated. P&lt;0.05 was considered as significant.

Results &amp; Discussion
The Candida-positive were 149 among all 248 samples 
including 60 oral candidiasis samples, 87 diaper dermatitis 
samples, and 2 samples having both infections. The most 
common infective agent was Candida albicans (64.4%). About 
43.6% of the children were born through cesarean and 15.4% of 
the patients had experienced Candida infection more that once. 
The 24.8% of the infants were fed by formula, the 70.5% were 
breastfed, and the 4.7% were fed by combination of formula 
and breast milk. We did not find a significant relationship 
between type of feeding and Candida infection (P=0.42, 

(see supplementary material)), which is consistent with most 
other studies such as Li et al 
[]. In contrast, another study 
showed that infants who are breatfed are at low-risk of 
suffering from moderate to severe dermatitis 
[]. In this study 
the 62.4% of the children were 1-3 years old, which is a 
common age for diaper dermatitis infection. This finding is 
consistent with another previous study []. Fifty and thirteen 
perecent of the infants had a history of taking antibiotic and 
antifungal, respectively. Moreover, 10.1% had previously used 
cortones (30% topical and 70% systemic). However, use of 
antibiotics and cortone did not have a significant relationship 
with Candida infection (P=0.7). We did not find any significant 
relationship between history of taking antibiotics and cortone 
and Candida infection. However, this could have affected the 
susceptibility of the studies samples. In a study investigated the 
risk factors of candidiasis, the researchers found that antibiotics 
(P=0.015) and corticosteroid (P=0.002) usage had a significant 
relationship with candidiasis []. The Candida albicans species 
isolated from oral candidiasis lesions were 100% susceptible to 
nystatin, posaconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B 
 (see supplementary material). We found that the 
resistance of Candida albicans to itraconazole, fluconazole, 
ketoconazole, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and posaconazole 
was 43.8%, 33.3%, 36.5%, 6.3%, 20.8%, and 7.3%, respectively. 
Also, Candida albicans susceptible to amphotericin B and 
nystatin. The resistance of non-Candida albicans species to
itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, 
clotrimazole, posaconazole, and nystatin was 41.5%, 35.8%, 
32.1%, 5.7%, 22.6%, 5.7%, and 11.3%, respectively. The non
Candida albicans species were not resistant to amphotericin B 
and only 1.9% were intermediate. The susceptibility of all 
different Candida species to nystatin, itraconazole, fluconazole, 
ketoconazole, amphotericin B, voriconazole, clotrimazole, and 
posaconazole were 95.3%, 38.3%, 63.1%, 38.9%, 99.3%, 89.9%, 
75.8%, and 91.9%, respectively. In our study, the 4% resistance 
to nystatin was found, while no resistance to amphotericin B 
was observed, which is consistent with some other studies 
[,
]. Therefore, these two antifungals can be recommended to 
treat likewise Candida infections. In a recent study on 150 
Candida species isolated from oral candidiasis lesions in 
patients with HIV/AIDS infection, the resistance of Candida 
albicans to fluconazole was 34.07% [], which was similar to 
the resistance found in our study (33.3%). However, in another 
recent study on 595 Candida species, the resistance of 10.5% to 
fluconazole was reported []. This difference could be justified 
by the use of antifungals and the genetics of Candida species. 
Obaci et al., reported a 59.6% resistance to fluconazole for C. 
albicans []. Another study on 177 Candida species isolated 
from oral lesions in AIDS patients showed 7.7 and 4.7% 
resitance to ketoconazole and itraconazole, respectively 
[],
which is much less than what we found (34.9 and 43%, 
respectively). This difference could be justified by several 
reasons such as frequent usage of antifungals. Another study 
showed that all Candida isolated were resistant to itraconazole
[]. Similar to Pfaller et al 
[], we found a lower resistance 
(6%) to voriconazole compared with Sharma et al, (10.99%) 
[].
We found a 21.5% resistant ratio to clotrimazole, which was 
relatively similar to a previous study on 53 Candidal vaginitis 
samples []. All cadida species were resistant to clotrimazole 
in another study []. The resistance to posaconazole was 
reported to be 90% in a study on 3312 Candida species 
[],
which was similar to this study as well as another study by
Cárdenes et al,. []. This shows the universal resistance of 
Candida to this antifungal. This study showed that Candida 
species have most susceptible to amphotericin B and used too 
much of this medicine are makes Candida species resistant to 
this drug makes difficult the treatment of infectious diseases 
resistance.

Conclusion
The resistance of different Candida species to nystatin, 
itraconazole, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clotrimazole, 
voriconazole, and posaconazole were 4, 43, 34.2, 34.9, 21.5, 6, 
and 6.7%, respectively. No resistance to amphotericin B was 
observed and 0.7% was intermediate. Since nystatin is used 
topically and has less systemic side effects and drug resistance 
compared with other antifungals, it is a suitable medication for 
the treatment of candidiasis.
