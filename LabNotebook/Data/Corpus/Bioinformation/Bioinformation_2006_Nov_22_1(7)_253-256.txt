Background
Continuous outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A in Asia 
has resulted in an urgent effort to improve current diagnostics tools to aid 
containment of the virus and lower the threat of a influenza pandemic. In 
recent years, the pathogenic H5N1 subtype of avian influenza A has been 
reported to cross species barrier and infect humans in Hong Kong during the 
1997 and 2003 outbreaks. [
,,] There are 16 subtypes of influenza virus A, among 
them the highly pathogenic are the avian H5N1 viruses which caused 18 confirmed 
infections and six deaths in Hong Kong during 1997. [] Thus, the H5N1 avian influenza - A 
virus is a known danger to human health across the globe.

The influenza A virus M1 protein is the most abundant structural component 
of the virion, and electron microscopy studies of influenza virus A particles 
show that M1 forms a shell at the internal surface of the viral membrane. 
[,,] 
The functions of M1 have been studied extensively, and it has been implicated 
in a variety of roles in the virus life cycle that include RNA and RNP binding 
[–], transcription inhibition [,,,,], and control of RNP nuclear import and export. [
–] Additionally, the matrix protein (M1) of influenza 
virus plays an essential role in viral replication. []

Therefore, in addition to containment procedures, detection of the cause of 
changes in the viral genome plays an important role in controlling the spread 
of the virus. Mutations in influenza viral proteins not only involve change in 
polarity or hydrophobicity but also the propensity of each residue to stabilize 
the secondary structures. [
] In the present study, comparison of sequences of Matrix protein (M1) 
of Influenza A H5N1 virus was carried out to estimate mutations between 
different strains.

Methodology
Sequence analysis
Matrix protein (M1) of Influenza A virus sub-type A/Hatay/2004/ (H5N1)
Continuous outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza A in Asia 
has resulted in an urgent effort to improve current diagnostics tools to aid 
containment of the virus and lower the threat of a influenza (H5N1). The M1 
protein sequence from GenBank [
] was used in this analysis [GenBank Accession number: CAJ01905]. 
Sequences similar to the M1 of A/Hatay/2004/(H5N1) were extracted from GenBank 
file influenza.faa at the FTP site 
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/INFLUENZA/ (). We used MAP MUTATION [] to identify mutations in these sequences. 
Hydropathy: Hydrophobicity values were calculated using PROTSCALE at expasy 
[] with the Kyte 
&amp; Doolittle hydrophobicity scale.

Secondary structure prediction
Secondary structures were predicted using NNPREDICT. [] Motif Search: Domains or motifs 
were searched using ScanProsite at the Expasy Server. [] Motifs with high probability of 
occurrence were included in the search.

Results
Sequence analysis and hydropathy
The M1 sequences from different strains were compared using the computer 
program MAP MUTATION. The mutation (valine to isoleucine) at position 205 was 
found to be common in almost all strains in  except for Thailand (ABC69235; AAT70223; ABB43126) and VietNam 
(AAZ72675; AAZ72687; AAZ72665). In addition, the valine to isoleucine mutation 
was observed at position 14 in China (ABC66622). This mutation is synonymous 
and will not change the chemical property at the site. However, non synonymous 
mutations A83S in Thailand - ABC69235 and S116A in China - AAT70589 were 
observed. This mutation changes the chemical property at the respective sites. 
Similar changes were observed at I168T, I14T and I168T in Thailand - ABB43126, 
China - AAY53536 and China - AAZ16338, respectively. Likewise, M59I in Russia - 
ABB43070 and T37A in China - AAT70593 were observed. The V138M mutation in 
VietNam - AAZ72687 is found at the Nmyristoylation site. A S13F mutation was 
also found in VietNam - AAZ72665.

Secondary structure prediction
We also analysed the secondary changes caused by these mutations. The 
mutations, I59M in Russia - ABB43070, I14T in China - AAY53536 and V138M in 
VietNam - AAZ72687 showed a change from coil to extended strand. We have 
presented our analysis data from secondary structure prediction at the website 

http://www.geocities.com/amubioinfo/InfluenzaAVirus.htm. 
Domain/motif Search: Domains found in the different strains of M1 protein are 
given in . This information is 
documented for future studies.

Discussion
Influenza A has the fastest mutation rate at 6.7x10-3 mutations per residue 
per year. [] Through 
mutations, antigenic drift enables influenza strains to replicate without being 
destroyed by the host defence mechanisms. [] It is important to predict mutations in Influenza 
virus to know specific mutations for increased transmissibility of the virus 
among humans. In the present communication, we analysed mutations in protein M1 
of Influenza A virus from chicken (H5N1) and studied changes associated with 
it. At least one mutation was noticed in each strain available in the dataset 
when compared with the reference sequence of A/Hatay/2004.

McCullers and colleagues demonstrated that a single point mutation at 
position 221 in the C-terminal domain of the M1 protein (Asparagine to Serine) 
was responsible for acquisition of virulence and lethality. [] It was observed that every 
mutation may not cause changes in the secondary structure. Moreover, the 
residue that was itself not undergoing change in secondary structure was 
capable of changing the conformation of nearby residues. In our previous study, 
we reported that mutations in predicted secondary structure may be due to 
changes in side chain conformation. [] It should be noted that further studies on Influenza H5N1 
virus is required to unfold the mystery of mutation.

Conclusion
Mutations in the M1 protein from different strains were studied to 
understand their relationship with susceptibility and infection by the virus. 
The analysis helped to document the location of specific mutations and the 
changes in properties related with it. Changes in predicted secondary 
structures were also observed at the site of few mutations. The locations of 
mutations at different PROSITE motifs were documented in this study.
