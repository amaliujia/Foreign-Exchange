Background
The ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C) protein is an
anaphase promoting complex and cyclosome (APC/C)-specific
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. It has a critical role in APC/Cdependent
M-phase cell-cycle progression by inactivating the
M-phase check point by targeted degradation of short lived
proteins [,
]. It also plays a role in mitotic spindle checkpoint
control []. Cells which are over expressing UBE2C ignore the
mitotic spindle checkpoint signals and lose genomic stability
accelerating cell proliferation[–]. Over expression of UBE2C at
the mRNA level is reported in a number of cancer cell lines and
primary tumors, including lung, gastric, breast, bladder, and
uterine cancers, whereas only low levels were found in normal
tissues []. Our studies on gene expression profiling, showed
UBE2C to be upregulated in cervical cancer when compared
with normal cervix and dysplasia []. We have also shown that
a 7 gene signature which includes UBE2C could be useful to
identify patients who can be treated with radiotherapy alone
[]. Functional studies inhibiting UBE2C was found to enhance
radiation and chemo-sensitivity in cervical cancer cell lines 
[].
UBE2C has been shown to be preferentially over expressed in
cancers compared to 17 other E2 genes []. In this manuscript
we describe computational studies to design specific inhibitors
for UBE2C. Computational techniques have become crucial
components of many drug discovery programmers, such as hit
identification to lead optimization and structure based virtual
screening [–].

Virtual screening is a process of screening small molecule
libraries for a subset of compounds enriched for interacting
with a therapeutic protein target of interest 
[]. The
knowledge of 3D structure of UBE2C can help in
understanding its function and role in cell in order to study the
molecular interaction with other proteins as well as to design
new molecules to inhibit its activity. To build the 3D structure
of UBE2C, homology modeling using NCBI BLAST algorithm
was used to identify the template. Crystal structure of Human
Mitotic-specific Ubiquitin Conjugating Enzyme (PDB code:
1I7K), a mutant protein showed 99% sequence similarity and it
was chosen as template for modeling UBE2C [–].Prime tool
(Schrodinger 2009) was employed to construct 3D structure of
UBE2C using 1I7K as template [,
]. Compound libraries
such as Drug-likeness NCI, Not annotated NCI , ChemBank,
ChemPDB and KEGG [] were virtually docked into the target
binding site through GLIDE a docking program 
[–], which
computationally models the ligand–target interaction to
achieve an optimal complementarity of steric and
physicochemical properties. The compounds which showed
minimum docking score can be further subjected to
experimental validation and clinical trials to establish a more
potent drug for treatment of different cancers.

Methodology
Homology modeling of UBE2C:
The sequence of UBE2C was obtained from UniProtKB/Swiss-
Prot []. NCBI BLAST programme was used to identify the
template for modeling. The results yielded by NCBI BLAST
against the PDB database revealed that crystal structure of
Human Mitotic-Specific Ubiquitin- Conjugating Enzyme (PDB
code: 1I7K), with a resolution of 1.95 Å as a suitable template.
The template and the target have 99% of residues identical with
an E-value of 1e-103. The structure was modeled with the help
of commercial software SCHRÖDINGER Prime module
(Schrödinger, 2009). The modeled structure was imported and
corrections were carried out by Protein Preparation wizard,
where hydrogen's were added automatically and refinement of
the structure was also done. Energy minimization was done by
using OPLS_AA force field and refinement was carried out
until average mean square deviation of the non hydrogen
atoms reached 0.3Å and the resulting optimized structure was
used for further studies

Active site prediction:
After obtaining the final model, the possible binding sites of
UBE2C were searched using Qsite Finder
(http://bmbpcu36.leeds.ac.uk/qsitefinder/) 
[,
] and
SiteMap (Schrodinger 2009) [,
]. Out of ten binding pockets
predicted by QsiteFinder and four pockets by sitemap, we
selected three pockets of QsiteFinder and one pocket of sitemap
which possess cystine at 114 for further docking studies.
SiteMap assigns numerical descriptors to evaluate predicted
binding sites by a series of physical parameters such as size,
degree of enclosure/exposure, tightness,
hydrophobic/hydrophilic character, and hydrogen bonding
possibilities. A weighted average of these measurements is then
assigned to prioritize possible binding sites.

Ligand selection and preparation:
Ligands were downloaded from Ligand Info
(http://ligand.info/). Ligand .Info is a compilation of various
publicly available databases of small molecules such as
ChemBank, ChemPDB, KEGG, Drug-likeness NCI subset and
Not annotated NCI subset. Small molecules can be downloaded
in SDF format and used for high throughput screening of new
potential drugs for UBE2C. The ligands did not have correct
bond orders and bond angles; they were subjected to full
minimization with OPLS_2005, followed by assigning
appropriate ionization state of each ligand by using the
“ionizer” option.

Grid Generation:
Residues of each active site in UBE2C was scaled by vander
waal's radii of 1.0Å with partial atomic charge less than 0.25Å
,gird was generated around active sites detected by QsiteFinder
and by SiteMap (Schrodinger) and enclosed by a box at the
centeroid of selected residues. Ligand docking jobs cannot be
performed until the receptor grids have been generated.
Receptor grid generation requires a “prepared” structure: an all
atom structure with appropriate bond orders and formal
charges (Schrodinger 2009).

Docking Studies:
We have applied the GLIDE docking method to build a binding
affinity model for UBE2C with ligands. Docking procedures
basically aim to identify the correct conformation of ligands in
the binding pocket of a protein and to predict the affinity
between the ligand and the protein. It is a process by which two
molecules fit together in a 3-dimensional space. Glide score was
based on Chemscore, but includes a steric clash term and adds
buried polar terms devised by Schrodinger to penalize
electrostatic mismatches. Glide score takes into account a
number of parameters such as Hydrogen bond (H bond),
hydrophobic (Lipo), Vander-Waals (vdW), columbic (Coul),
polar interactions in the binding site (site), metal binding term
(metal) and penalty for buried polar group (Burry P) and
freezing rotatable bonds (RotB).

G-Score = H bond + Lipo +Metal + site + 0.130 Coul + 0.065
vdW – Bury P – RotB

ADME/T properties prediction:
Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity
(ADME/T) properties of glide docked molecules were
predicted using QikProp tool of Schrodinger. It predicts
properties such as octanol/water partition, log BB, overall CNS
activity, Caco-2 and MDCK cell permeability, logKhsa for
human serum albumin binding and log IC50 for HERG K+
channel blockage [–].

Results
Structure prediction and evaluation:
The sequence of UBE2C was obtained from UniProtKB/Swiss-
Prot. We used NCBI BLAST programme to identify the
template for modeling. The results yielded by NCBI BLAST
against the PDB database revealed that crystal structure of
Human Mitotic-Specific Ubiquitin- Conjugating Enzyme (PDB
code: 1I7K), with a resolution of 1.95 Å can be used as suitable
template because the template and the target having 99%
similarity with an E-value of 1e-103 (). The structure of
UBE2C was modeled with the help of commercial software
SCHRÖDINGER Prime module (Schrödinger, 2009). The
modeled structure was imported and corrections were carried
out by Protein Preparation wizard, hydrogens were added
automatically and refinement of the structure was also done.
Energy minimization was done by using OPLS_AA force field
and refinement was carried out until average mean square
deviation of the non hydrogen atoms reached 0.3Å and the
resulting optimized structure was used for further studies. The
stereochemical properties of UBE2C model was evaluated by
Ramachnadran plot after protein preparation script of
Schrodinger. 96.5% of the residues were in the favored region,
2.8% were in the allowed region and only 0.7% was in the
disfavored region .These results indicate that the phi and psi
back-bone dihedral angles in the UBE2C model are accurate
[,
].

Binding pocket prediction:
The binding pockets of UBE2C model was predicted by QSiteFinder
and SiteMap (Schrodinger, 2009). QsiteFinder detects
by binding hydrophobic probes to the protein and finding
clusters of probes with the most favorable binding energy.
These clusters are placed in rank order of the likelihood of
being a binding site according to the sum total binding energies
for each cluster. () shows ten different binding pockets
predicted by Q-SiteFinder. Binding site prediction of UBE2C
was also performed in Maestro using SiteMap (Schrodinger,
2009) package, it identifies one potential binding site with site
score of &gt;0.9. SiteMap highlights regions within the binding site
suitable for occupancy by hydrophobic groups or by ligand
hydrogen-bond donors, acceptors, or metal-binding
functionality. SiteScore, the scoring function of sitemap used to
assess a site's propensity for ligand binding, accurately ranks
possible binding sites to eliminate those not likely to be
pharmaceutically relevant. The following residues are
predicted as best binding sites for UBE2C Ser51, Ala52, Phe53,
Val63, Gly64, Thr65, Tyr74, Leu77, Lys80, Phe98, Leu99, Thr100,
Pro101, Cys102, His104, Pro105, Val107, Asp108, Thr109,
Gln110, Gly111, Asn149, Ala152, Tyr165,Leu166,Thr169, Tyr170,
Gln173,Val174 with sitescore 0.928 ().

Docking Studies:
For docking studies we selected three binding pockets of
QsiteFinder which posses CYS114 in its pocket and sitemap
pocket. Pocket 1: Tyr103, His104, Pro105, Asn106, Val107,
Asp108, Thr109, Gln110, Gly111, Asn112, Ile113, cys114,
Leu115, Asp116, Ile117, Leu118; Pocket 2: His104, Pro105,
Asn106, Cys114, Leu138, Pro142, Asn143, Ile144, Asp145,
Ser146, Pro147, Leu148, Ala152, Ala153, Glu154, Trp156; Pocket
3:Phe98,Cys102,Tyr103,His104,Pro105,Asn106,Val107,Asp108,G
ly111,Ile113,Cys114,Leu138, Leu148,Asn149.

Compounds from different ligand database (ligand.info) such
as Druglikeness, NCI annotated, ChemBank, KEGG and PDB
were downloaded and we generated 3D structures using ligand
preparation tool. The prepared compounds from different
datasets were docked into different binding pockets and
compounds which showed high binding affinities were filtered
using ADME properties. The compounds were docked into
UBE2C considering ligands as flexible and protein as rigid. We
used standard precision mode of Glide for all docking
calculations. The docking scores of most potent ligands of
different datasets are listed in 
 (see
supplementary materials). The compounds of Not annotated
NCI subset such as 2,4-diimino-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazepan-6-one
forms three hydrogen bonds with Ile113 and two hydrogen
bonds with Leu118 and shows a docking score of -6.401379, 2,4-
diimino-1-methyl-1,3,5-triazepan-6-one and 1,4-di(1Hbenzimidazol-
2-yl)-1,2,3,4-butanetetrol binds with Asp108 and
Cys102 of active site with binding score of -6.206891 and -
7.05162 respectively ().

The compounds of Drug-likeness NCI subset sulfuric acid
compound with 5,6-diamino-2,4-pyrimidinediol (1:1) , 1,6-
dihydro-3-pyridinecarboxamide 1-oxide, nicotinic acid
compound with 8-quinolinol (1:1) , 1H-imidazole-1-sulfonic
acid compound with 1H-imidazole (1:1) () were
binding with docking score of above -6 (). 1, 6-dihydro-
3-pyridinecarboxamide 1-oxide forms an hydrogen bond with
Cys114 of active site (). The compounds of different
subsets such ChemBank (), ChemPDB () and
KEGG () which showed good binding score with
UBE2C are listed in . Itdac-6 (N- hydroxy- 3, 5-
dimethyladamantane- 1- carboxamide) chembank compound
binds with UBE2C and forms hydrogen bond with Cys 114 and
Asn143. 12(s), 20-DIHETE forms four hydrogen bonds with
residues Asp116, Asn143, Gly140 and Ala 153 and have very
less docking score -6.28781. The binding mode of ChemPDB
compounds are shown in (). 3-Aminopyridine adenine
forms seven hydrogen bonds with Cys114, Lys119, Glu141,
Asn143, Asp145 and Ser146. 2-deoxy steromycin shows
interaction with Cys114, Asp116 and Lys121.

The ADME properties of these compounds were analyzed
using QikProp tool of Schrodinder software. QikProp settings
determine which molecules are flagged as being dissimilar to
other 95% of the known drugs. The ADME/T properties such
as permeability through MDCK cells (QPlogMDCK), logKp
(Skin permeability),QikProp predicted log IC50 value for
blockage of K+ channels (QPlogHERG), percentage of human
oral absorption of compounds were reported in
Supplementary  (see supplementary material). The
number of stars of most of the compounds was within
acceptable range. A large number of stars suggest that a
molecule is less drug like than molecules with few
stars.QikProp also evaluated physiochemical properties of
compounds such as their molecular weights, hydrogen bond
donors, hydrogen bond acceptors and solubility  (see
supplementary material), and these properties were well
within acceptable range of the Lipinski rule for drug like
molecules. These molecules were further evaluated for their
pharmacokinetic properties such as octanol/water partition
coefficient, cell permeability of Caco-2 cells and blood/brain
partition coefficient. All these pharmacokinetic properties were
within acceptable range for most of the compounds, the
compounds which showed very high docking score and within
the acceptable range of ADME/T properties would be taken for
further studies.

Discussion
Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 2C (UBE2C) participates in cell
cycle progression and checkpoint control by targeted
degradation of short-lived proteins []. As a conjugating
enzyme, it directs polyubiquitination and in addition to its role
in cyclin B destruction that is essential for exit from mitosis,
UBE2C also plays an important role in mitotic spindle
checkpoint control. Cells overexpressing UBE2C ignore the
mitotic spindle checkpoint signals and lose genomic stability,
which leads to cancer and poor prognosis in many cancers. Our
previous studies have shown UBE2C to be a potential target for
treatment in cervical cancer [–].

In the present study we modeled UBE2C using Prime
homology modeling and corrections were carried out using
protein preparation wizard and its sterochemical properties
were checked by Ramachandran plot. Based on Ramachandran
plot analysis, a good quality model would be expected to have
above 90% in the most favoured region , the modeled structure
of UBE2C in our study have 96.5% residues in most favoured
region and the distribution of the main chain bond lengths and
bond angles found to be within the limits. The PDB structure
1I7K was compared with modeled UBE2C (Ser114 → Cys114) to
find structural alignment using the RMSD value, the RMSD
score for 3D structure of UBE2C was below 2.00Å and the
structure could be taken for further analysis. Missing hydrogen
atoms and unfilled valence atoms were corrected using protein
preparation and the protein was subjected to energy
minimization using the OPLS 2009 force field.

The active sites predicted by Q-Site Finder and SiteMap were
used for further screening and docking studies. The ligand
database was used for virtual screening against UBE2C using
Glide docking tool of Schrodinger using standard precision
mode. To identify compounds which were having good
binding affinity four parameters are considered: G-Score, Glide
Energy, H-bonds and Good Van-der-walls interactions. The
more negative value of Glide score indicates that good binding
affinity of ligand with receptor. 1,4-di(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-
1,2,3,4-butanetetrol binds with UBE2C with a high G-Score of -
7.05162 and it forms six hydrogen bonds via residues
Asp108,Cys102,Phe98 and with Thr109. The compounds which
showed very high scores and its interaction through hydrogen
bonds with UBE2C are shown in Fig 6. The top scored
compounds forms hydrogen bonds with residues such as
Asp108, Cys102, and Ile113. This allows us to conclude that the
compounds which have high binding score, high binding
energy and have more hydrogen bonds are best inhibitors of
UBE2C. In order to confirm the drug like properties of the
docked compounds, prediction of ADME/T properties was
performed. According to Lipinski's rule of five, the lead
molecules molecular weights are below &lt;500 Daltons with &lt;5
hydrogen bond donors, &lt; 10 hydrogen bond acceptors and a
log p value within acceptable range. These compounds are
further evaluated for their drug-like behavior through analysis
of pharmacokinetic parameters required for absorption,
distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) by
use of QikProp. For most of the compounds, the partition
coefficient (QPlogPo/w) and water solubility (QPlogS) shows
good results with least number of stars and least number of
violations. We also analyzed cell permeability (QPPCaco), a
key factor governing drug metabolism and its access to
biological membranes, ranged from 0 to 9906.Overall, the
percentage human oral absorption for the compounds ranged
from 0 to 100 %. The compounds which are not within the
acceptable range will not be taken for further drug screening
analysis. Compounds which pass all filter levels will be
considered as possible drug candidates for UBE2C.

Conclusion
Three dimensional structure of UBE2C was predicted with
good sterochemical properties. The structure was used for
further docking studies and for structure based drug discovery.
The high scoring docking molecules were analyzed further for
their binding affinity and ADME/T properties. Compounds
which show good binding affinity and pass Lipinski's rule and
ADME/T properties within acceptable range can be evaluated
in vivo and in vitro and may be developed as inhibitor of
UBE2C.
