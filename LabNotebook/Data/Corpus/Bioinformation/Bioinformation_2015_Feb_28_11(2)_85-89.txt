Background
Ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) is a valued crop of family
Zingiberaceae, rhizomes of which are used in medicine as well as
in spice. India is a leading ginger producer, accounting for
about 30% of the global share and during 2012-13 it produced
7.45 lakh tonnes from an area of 1.57 lakh hectares out of total
global production of 20.95 Lakh tons 
[]. Ginger is cultivated as
a spice crop in many states of India. Out of the country's total
ginger production, Kerala, Meghalaya, Orissa, Gujarat, Assam,
and Arunachal Pradesh together contribute 65 per cent. There is
an international market for Indian ginger at current selling
price of around $2800-$2850 per ton []. Reports on evaluation
of existing rich diversity in indian ginger germplasm are based
on phenotypic and phytochemical characteristics which exhibit
plasticity and sensitivity to environmental conditions 
[].

Molecular characterization using PCR based markers are
established as robust, reproducible and reliable when
compared to morphological and phytochemical markers. Use of
these markers reduces the cost, time and labour during analysis
[,
]. Markers ISSR, SSR, IRAP etc. has been reported for
assessing genetic variation in Zingiber or other members of the
Zingiberaceae family [–
] that exclude reports on the discovery
and use of quality SNPs to understand the genetic analysis of
ginger. Single nucleotide polymorphism is basically single-base
allelic variation between two haplotype sequences or between
any of the homologous pair of chromosome. SNPs are
abundantly found among variations prevalent in genomic DNA
both in coding and non-coding regions []. These are
responsible for various genetic traits, conserved through
evolution and compatible for next generation high-throughput
genotyping. However, sequencing of selected DNA fragments
for SNPs identification has been subjected to limitations like;
higher rate of sequencing error and intensive cost incurred
during sequencing the fragments amplified. The alternate cost
effective option for SNPs discovery from public database is by
using the most extensive resource of ESTs data (dbESTs) hosted
by The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
[]. ESTs database has been commonly used for discovery of
new genes, exon-intron structure verification, cDNA array
construction and gene mapping []. These polymorphisms
obtained from ESTs represent numerous functional genes
which controls many genetic traits [–
]. Many bioinformatics
tools, programs as well as pipelines are developed for mining
of SNPs by using several input and/or output formats,
computational algorithms, filtration and evaluation strategies
for getting quality SNPs. There are many programs and
pipelines for detection of SNPs viz; SEAN [] PolyPhred 
[]
PolyBayes [] TRACE_DIFF 
[], HarvEST 
[], AutoSNP 
[],
QualitySNP [] QualitySNPng 
[]. QualitySNP has three
filtering system to eliminate unreliable variations and to handle
typical sequencing errors in absence of sequenced reference
genome. Extracted SNPs information has been useful for QTL
mapping and genome-wide association studies [,
]. Since its
publication, the QualitySNP has been successfully used for the
identification of SNPs markers in dozens of projects viz; in crop
plants [], zebra finch 
[], water fleas 
[], snakes 
[] and
scallops []. The haplotype-based strategy can make full use of
redundancy in sequences by re-clustering them, so that the
influence of sequencing errors is avoided and poor quality
sequences are removed. QualitySNP pipeline identifies
paralogs and quality SNPs on heterozygous diploid as well as
polyploid species. Therefore, in the present attempt, an effort is
taken to utilize the existing updated ESTs tissue libraries of
Zingiber officinale to find the SNP/Indels polymorphisms using
38115 ESTs and categorized into three tissue libraries leaves
(13282), rhizomes (12763) and roots (12092) ESTs [,
]. High
quality SNPs detecting tool QualitySNP is used to identify the
high quality exonic and intronic polymorphisms, haplotypes
and DNA substitutions like transitions, transversions and
Indels.

Methodology
Data Mining:
A total of 38115 Z. officinale ESTs sequence (13282 Leaves ESTs
(DV544275.1-ES560515.1), 12763 Rhizomes ESTs (DY363350.1-
DY363469.1) and 12092 Roots ESTs (DY375442.1-DY375561.1))
were retrieved from the dbEST [] hosted by GeneBank
(NCBI) using the keywords “Zingiber officinale” and grouped
into the respective tissues library.

Sequence Pre-Processing and Clustering:
To get high quality ESTs, Poly-A/T tails and unexpected vector
sequences were filtered and trimmed using Trimest 
[] online
program of EMBOSS suite and SeqClean software 
[] with
reference of the UniVec database of NCBI. ESTs having length ≥
50 bp are traced out if any found to increase assembly quality.
The ESTs of high quality were then assembled into contigs
using CAP3 [] program at 90% identity. Tissue-wise ESTs
assemblies were conducted to reduce redundancy.

High Quality SNPs Discovery:
The Linux based command line program QualitySNP pipeline
used for extraction of SNPs []. QualitySNP detected the
haplotypes present in the contigs through ESTs re-clustering
and discrepancies in nucleotide were extracted between
identified haplotypes of a contig. These are considered as
potential SNPs (pSNP). Basing on confidence scores of SNPs
and allele, quality SNPs (qSNP) were identified 
[]. The
nucleotide discrepancies percentage is obtained from
qSNP/pSNP ratios using the QualitySNP algorithm.

Prioritizing High Quality SNPs:
Contigs from all assemblies of ginger were processed through
ORF finder program [] for locating possible positive or
negative open reading frame. From whole ESTs assembly only
101 contigs contains ORF with AUG as a start codon. Out of
8810 qSNP only 2355 qSNP were located in exonic/orf region
while 6455 qSNP in non-coding regions. Distribution of qSNP
into exonic and intronic region is shown in .

Discussion
We obtained 6323 contigs and 17421 singletons from 38115
ESTs from all tissues together accounting to 5455657 consensus
sizes of 23708402 base pairs. In this study, a total of 11523
potential SNPs and 8810 high quality SNPs sites and 1008
indels polymorphisms are discovered from 38115 numbers of
analysed ESTs with an average frequency of 1.61 SNPs / 10 kbp
and 0.18 indels/10 kbp. The size of the contigs varied from 100
to 2954 bp, with an average length of 862 bp. An overview of
the tissue wise assembly pertaining to contigs, singletons,
indels, and SNPs detection and other parameters are depicted
in  (see supplementary material). Ginger tissue wise
prevalence of exonic SNPs and intronic SNPs as per their
occurrence in coding and non-coding regions is detailed in
 which shows highest in the leaf tissues.
When compared tissue wise libraries in ginger, leaves tissue are
showing highest SNPs (4895), indels (452), haplotypes (121),
transitions (1572) and transversions (2871) in comparison to
other tissues. Rhizome tissues are showing the highest ratio of
base pairs per SNP (3145), per Indels (28628) and highest ratio
of high quality to potential SNPs (0.82). SNPs substitutions
obtained from all tissues has a ratio of transitions to
transversions at 0.57. Details of DNA substitutions parameters
for other tissues are found in  &amp; 
. As
compared to the SNPs analysis in ginger, total 31815 potential
SNPs, 16772 high quality SNPs and 1815 indels were mined out
of total ESTs 83565 in potato [], 37344 SNPs in Arabidopsis
[], in the maize prevalence of SNPs in non-coding and
coding were found to be 1 per 31 bp and 1 per 124 bp
respectively []. The average SNPs occurrence in Apple ESTs
was found to be one in every 706 bp []. SNPs frequency is
higher, ie. 1.61 SNPs per 10 kbp in certain of the genomes like
ginger. Similar discoveries on SNPs were also reported in
Arabidopsis ecotypes viz; one SNP every 3.3 kb in Landsberg
erecta and one SNP every 6.1 kb in Columbia 
[]. One SNP per
20 bp is reported in bread wheat between genes from the A, B
and C genomes [] and in maize the SNPs frequency is found
to be one Indel /160 bp and one SNP/70 bp []. QualitySNP
detected high frequency of transitions in ginger in the present
analysis, which corroborates previous SNPs discovery reports
[]. High frequency of C to T mutation in this ESTs derived
SNPs in ginger may be due to methylation []. The reported
abundance of A/T ratio as well as its reverse complement
remains unexplained. Out of total SNPs substitutions detected
in this attempt, transversions of all tissues is/are comparatively
higher than the transitions which corroborates previous report
on the ginger SNPs detection and assigns the reason of ginger is
being vegetative propagated crop through rhizome [].

Our study for the first time provides information about high
quality SNPs (8810) and 1008 indels polymorphisms in addition
to information about potential SNPs (11523) because of the use
of triple filtration based on stringent analysis of ESTs database
using QualitySNP when compared with the pearl script
AutoSNP version 1.0 based analysis of ginger ESTs with higher
number of potential 64026 SNPs sites and 7034 indels
polymorphisms []. The present analysis provides additional
information about tissues wise presence of haplotypes (222)
distribution of high quality exonic (2355) and intronic (6455)
SNPs and information about singletons (17421) in addition to
contigs ( and 
). Different
software׳s used for SNPs mining during in silico study using
the same ESTs database in Sea bass has been reported which
exhibits level of stringency implied, and the difference in
output in quality SNPs during analysis [] justifies the use of
most recent and efficient QualitySNP software integrated with
better filtration strategy. We are able to discover the reduced
number of quality SNPs in addition to potential SNPs, which
may help geneticists and breeders working in/on cultivar
identification, germplasm conservation in ginger to a greater
extent.

Conclusion
We have detected 11523 potential SNPs sites with 8810 high
quality, and 1008 indels polymorphisms as well as 1.61 SNPs /
1000 bp frequency using recent software QualitySNP. Of ESTs
libraries collected from 3 tissues, rhizomes had a frequency of
0.32 SNPs and 0.03 indels per 1000 bp, but the leaves had 2.51
SNPs and 0.23 indels per 1000 bp and root is showing relative
frequency 0.76/1000 bp SNPs and 0.02/1000bp indels. The
present analysis provides additional information about tissues
wise presence of haplotypes (222) distribution of high quality
exonic (2355) and intronic (6455) SNPs and information about
singletons (7538) in addition to contigs transitions and
transversions ratio was 0.57. Among all tissue detected SNPs,
transversions number is higher in comparison to the transition.
The quality SNPs detected can be used as potential markers for
ginger genetic studies.
