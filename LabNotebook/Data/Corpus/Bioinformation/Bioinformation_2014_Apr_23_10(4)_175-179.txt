Background
High throughput sequencing technologies has contributed to 
the increase in the number of sequencing projects which in turn 
increase the number of completely sequenced genomes. This 
increase in sequenced genomes demands hike in genome 
annotation which includes gene identification and its functional 
annotation. One of the important parts in genome annotation is 
the identification of promoter, the specific regions on the 
upstream of gene where the RNA polymerase binds to initiate 
transcription which is one of the major steps in gene regulation.

The sequence, structure and composition of promoters of 
eukaryotes and prokaryotes differ in many aspects. Prokaryotic 
promoter prediction is a comparatively easier task due to their 
relatively simpler gene structure and their high sequence 
conservation. The complexity of eukaryotic promoter structure 
makes their identification a difficult task. Even though many 
computational methods and machine learning techniques are 
powerful in making highly accurate predictions by learning the 
underlying data patterns, they are not yet widely explored for 
the eukaryotic promoter prediction.

The available promoter prediction algorithms are of three 
types- signal based, property based, and hybrid approach. In 
signal-based method, DNA sequences are first mapped to 
signals and are analysed to capture the strong signature 
features for the promoter. In property based method, various 
physico-chemical properties are derived from training data set.

In the hybrid approach, a combination of signal based and 
physico-chemical property based approaches are used. 
Computational methods like soft computing techniques are 
largely based on the presence of core-promoters, TSS region 
and specific motifs like TATA box, INR, DPE, BRE 
[–]. The 
performances of all these algorithms are highly dependent on 
the training dataset used for deriving the information.

Elucidating the sequence to be a promoter in terms of 
quantitative characterization, termed promoter strength, is one 
of the new themes in promoter prediction. Many experimental 
methods are available for measuring the promoter activity 
based on reporter protein activity determination such as 
luminescence, fluorescence and spectrometry of enzyme 
products []. 
The main challenge is to fit the data obtained from 
the wet lab experiments into the computational models.

Combinatorial synthesis [] and artificial engineering of 
promoters is a fast growing area in synthetic biology. The 
characterization of promoters will accelerate the bottom up 
approach for designing the genetic construct for useful 
applications. The massive parallel sequencing method like 
ChIP-seq can be used for the identification of promoters in 
different cellular conditions []. This will give more resolution 
to the mechanism and function of promoters. This can be 
extended as a tool for automated synthesis of promoter 
sequence and can serve as a module in tools and programming 
languages for synthetic biology []. In this study, our aim was 
to develop a model for predicting promoter sequence and to 
predict its strength in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

Methodology
Dataset:
Promoters of E. coli and humans were downloaded from 
RegulonDB [] and Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD) 
[] 
respectively. For E. coli, non-promoter data sets were prepared 
from both the intergenic regions of E. coli genome downloaded 
from Ecogene [] and the gene sequences downloaded from 
RegulonDB. Human negative set was obtained from gene 
sequences downloaded from NCBI-Gene database. 

Context structure features:
The presence of n-mers is considered as the context structure 
feature for both E. coli and human promoter prediction [,
]. 
In this study, all possible 5 mers (45) are taken into account. 
Every test sequence is assigned a “ContextScore” which is 
calculated from the count of occurrence of 5-mers in the training 
data as well as test data.

feature_value(X)=c/l, where X is a 5-mer present ‘c’ number of 
times. ‘l’=total number of 5-mers in the sequence. The mean 
(m1(X)) and standard deviation d1(X) of all the feature values 
for feature X for a set of N positive sequences is: (Please see 
 for equation 1 &amp; 2).

Z-test is used as one of the measures to classify a test sequence 
as promoter or non-promoter. Based on the Z-test, “score1”, 
“score2” and the ContextScore is calculated as follows:

if |x-m1(X)|/d1(X) &lt;3 then score1=1 else score1=0 
if |x-m0(X)|/d0(X) &gt;3 then score2=1 else score2=0 
ContextScore = (score1 + score2)/(2*(length(D)) (3)

Prediction of promoters in human sequences:
For identifying a human promoter sequence, the presence of 
TATA box is searched and its presence makes TATA_score 1 or 
else score is 0. The initiation element (Inr) in the test sequences 
were then searched and if it is present, the presence of Down 
Stream Promoter Element (DPE) is also confirmed. If both INR 
and DPE are present, Inr_score =1, else Inr_score = 0. CpG 
island association is another sequence signal feature considered 
for human promoter prediction. GC percentage and 
observed/expected ratio are used to confirm the presence of 
CpG islands.

Observed/Expected (o/e) = p(CG)/{p(C) * p(G)} (4)

Where, n(C) is the number of C׳s in a test sequence, n(G) is the 
number of G׳s in a test sequence, L is the length of the test 
sequence, and n(CG) is the number of CG׳s in a test sequence. 
Finally if GCp &gt; 0.5 and o/e &gt; 0.4, then D is CpG related and 
GC_score = 1, else GC_score = 0.

Final score for the test sequence is calculated as follows: 
FinalScore = (ContextScore + TATA_score + Inr_score + 
GC_score)/4 (5) 

Prediction of promoters in E. coli sequences:
For E. coli sequences we searched for TATAAT, TTGACA and TSS. 
To calculate TATAAT_score, TTGACA_score and TSS_score of a 
test sequence, sub-sequences separated by 20 bases are searched 
for a match of minimum three positions within the sequence TATAAT 
and then TTGACA. TATAAT_score and TTGACA_score are then calculated 
as the sum of the individual position scores calculated based on 
the probability of occurrence of individual symbols at their 
specific positions in the consensus sequence, as in  
(see supplementary material) divided by six []. If stop codons 
are not present, then TATAAT_score is set to zero. If the latter 
sub-sequence only matches less than three positions with the test 
sequence, then TTGACA_score is set to zero. If TATAAT_score&gt; 0 and 
TTGACA_score&gt;0, then the Transcription Start Site score, TSS_score = 1 for the test sequence.

Transcription Start Site score, TSS_score = 1 for the test 
sequence. 
AT content in a test sequence is calculated using the following 
measures. 
p (A) = number of As in the test sequence/length (test 
sequence); p (T) = number of Ts in the test sequence/length 
(test sequence); p (AT) = number of ATs in the test 
sequence/length (test sequence); AT_content = p (A) + p (T) 
Observed/Expected, oeAT = p(AT)/(p(A)*p(T)) 


Final score for the test sequence is calculated as follows: 
FinalScore=(score+AT_Score+TSS_score)/4 (6) 

FinalScore and thresholds were selected by a random trial and 
error method  (see supplementary material) based on 
the training set.  illustrates Promoter Prediction System 
Using Context based Method for Human and E. coli Promoters. 
The test results obtained are tabulated as in  (see 
supplementary material). A comparison with similar tools is
given in supplementary file 1. The result shows that the 
prediction performance of the method is higher compared to 
other commonly used tools.

Comparison with PHI:
263 promoters with known PHI (Promoter Homology Index), 
the index to quantify promoter strength [], are used for the 
study and have been compared with the computationally 
identified promoter strength. Also, the correlation between the 
predicted final score and PHI index are taken note of.

Results &amp; Discussion
The method employs the context structure feature 
which relies on the count of n-mers along with sequence 
signal features. Most of the existing systems include a 
selection of 5-mers as feature elements. 5-mers are 
significant since it is the smallest n-mer which can 
encapsulate the behavior of consensus sequence. 
The PPS-CBM reported in this paper stands out for its 
comprehensive use of the complete set of possible 5-mers 
(1024). We have taken this approach as the biological 
significance of such a large number of 5-mers cannot be 
easily analyzed. No literature has yet reported a list of highly 
impacting 5-mers and their predictive powers. Using such a large 
number of 5-mers naturally puts a heavy demand on the computational 
requirement. However this is not a major concern as this occurs 
only at the time of training, not during individual predictions.

It would be ideal to go from the comprehensive set to either (1) 
biologically significant 5-mers or (2) statistically significant 5-
mers, which are confirmed to have predictive power. Further, 
PPS-CBM also uses most of the consensus features - TATA box, 
Initiator Elements, and Downstream Promoter Elements for 
human promoter prediction. The TATA- box is a core promoter 
element in eukaryotes []. If TATA boxes are absent in 
promoter sequences, Initiator elements [] and Down Stream 
Promoter Elements (DPE) [] are used to identify promoters. 
Another feature used is the presence of CpG islands. Since CpG 
Islands are found near the promoter region in mammalian 
genes [], it is a significant feature to identify human 
promoter. TATAAT box and TTGACA box are the important 
consensus features used in case of E. coli promoters, for 
accomplishing the task of prediction. Promoter region is less 
stable compared to the coding region which shows the 
abundance of Adenine and Thymine. The AT percentage, a 
feature used for predicting E. coli promoters, thus makes a 
significant contribution to the prediction model. The final score 
calculated is correlated with Promoter Homology Index (PHI) 
values of E. coli sequences and a high correlation of 0.60 is 
obtained. 

Conclusion
We reiterate that PPS-CBM is the first one that is noticed to 
have a unified predictor for both eukaryotes and prokaryotes 
and in spite of this generality; the supplementary file 1 clearly 
shows an enhancement in the prediction performance. Another 
advantage of this model is that it gives a clue to the promoter 
strength which is not a common feature found in other existing 
tools. PPS-CBM reports a measure which can be correlated with 
the strength of the promoter. Based on the scores calculated, the
promoters can be classified into weak, strong and very strong 
categories.
