Background
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the prime killer among infectious agents,
accounting for 7% of all deaths and 26% of all preventable deaths 
[]. The cure
of tuberculosis is a special problem in the field of chemotherapy. Many of the
drugs employed to treat the disease are used only for treating infections caused
by Mycobacteria. Treatment of the active TB cases always includes
simultaneous therapy with two or more of the frontier drugs such as isoniazid,
ethambutol, rifampicin, and streptomycin, which are used to decrease the rate
of emergence of resistant strains as well as to increase the antibacterial effect
[]. 
Recent outbreaks of tuberculosis caused by multidrug- resistant strains,
mainly in individuals infected with HIV have created a worldwide interest in
expanding current therapeutic programs. Analysis of complete genome
sequences of the pathogen M. tuberculosis 
[] and the host Homo sapiens (The
Genome International Consortium, 2001) allows one to identify the functions
unique to the host and the pathogen, thus facilitating the development of drugs
specifically targeting the pathogen. Even among the pathways shared by the
host and the pathogen, there are several proteins from pathways involved in
lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy
metabolism, vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis, and nucleotide metabolism,
which do not bear similarity to host proteins 
[]. The enzymes in the pathways
of M. tuberculosis, which do not exhibit similarity to any protein from the host,
represent attractive potential drug targets. Amino acid sequence of the probable
DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (Rv1547) of M. tuberculosis does not
exhibit significant identity (below BLASTp e-value threshold of 0.005) with its
counterpart in human host, and therefore can be a potential drug target against
the pathogen.

DNA polymerases play fundamental roles in DNA replication and repair.
Among the five known eubacterial DNA polymerases (I-V), polymerase III
(PolIII) is accountable for catalyzing DNA replication, and whereas others
(PolI, II, IV and V) are involved in supplementary roles in replication and
repair. The eubacterial PolIII holoenzyme, is a complex made up of ten
subunits namely the replicase (α, ε, θ), the clamp loader 
(ϒ, δ, δ’, ζ, χ, ψ), and
the sliding clamp (β2) [,
]. The α subunit works as a replicative DNA
polymerase at the replication fork and plays a central role in the complex 
[].
Based on amino acid sequence comparisons, DNA-dependent DNA
polymerases are divided into six families denoted by A, B, C, D, X, and Y 
[],
of which A, B and C family polymerases play critical roles in replication.
Family A includes eubacterial DNA polymerase I whereas family B represents
all archaeal and eukaryotic replicative polymerases. The α subunit of PolIII is a
member of family C []. 
The structures of the α subunit from family C have
been determined recently from Thermus aquaticus (TaqPolIIIα) 
[] and
Escherichia coli (EcoPolIIIα) 
[]. Although the crystal structure of
MtbDnaE1 has not yet been resolved, the amino acid sequence of MtbDnaE1
shows high sequence identity with the TaqPolIIIα and EcoPolIIIα. The present
study has been conducted to understand and elucidate the 3-D structure of
DNA polymerase III alpha subunit of M. tuberculosis (MtbDnaE1) by
homology modeling. This work describes, for the first time a structural model
of MtbDnaE1. Knowledge of these structural features of MtbDnaE1 is essential
for establishing its catalytic mechanisms of action at the molecular level, as
well as to target the protein for designing effective and selective drug. We have
also attempted to predict the interaction between DNA polymerase III alpha
and its potential inhibitor namely 251D in silico via the process of docking.

Methodology
Phylogenetic analysis and sequences alignment
For phylogenetic analysis, the amino acid sequence of the MtbDnaE1 
[] was
aligned against homologues sequences collected from the SwissProt
(http://www.expasy.org/sprot/) database at PSI-BLAST E-value: 0.001 by
using ConSurf server []. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using
ClustalW []. Putative phylogenetic trees prediction for multiple sequence
alignment by cluster algorithms was done by TreeTop- Phylogenetic Tree
Prediction server []. In the bootstrap, multiple alignment was resampled 100
times, i.e. 100 trees were generated.

Structure modeling and validation, and identification of functional
domains
A blast search for MtbDnaE1 sequence (accession number NP_216063) was
performed to search for the most suitable templates. The structures of DNA
polymerase III alpha subunit from Thermus aquaticus (PDB entry 2HPI_A)
and Escherichia coli (PDB entry 2HNH_A) were taken from Protein Database
(PDB) []. 
Multiple sequence alignment of the target and templates was
performed using ClustalW. The final structural models were built by using the
mod6v2 version of the MODELLER program 
[]. The generated 3-D
structural models were visualized by Swiss PDB Viewer 
[]. The models were
evaluated at various structure verification servers as PROCHECK and
WHAT_CHECK. The best model was chosen on the basis of its stereo
chemical quality account using PROCHECK 
[] and WHAT_CHECK 
[].
The functional domains of MtbDnaE1 were obtained by submitting amino acid
sequence to Pfam and InterPro servers [,
].

Docking of the inhibitor 251D onto the active site of MtbDnaE1
The ligand molecule 251D is the hybrid compound of anilinouracil, 3-(4-
hydroxybutyl)-6-(3-ethyl-4-methylanilino) uracil (HB-EMAU), and
fluoroquinolone, {1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-7-[1-(3-methyl)piperazinyl]-4-
oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline}-3-carboxylic acid (340E) 
]. The ligand molecule
was retrieved from CORINA ]. The Modeller-generated three dimensional
structure of MtbDnaE1 was taken as receptor molecule. The AutoDock 4.0
suite was used as molecular-docking tool ]. The Graphical User Interface
program “Auto-Dock Tools” was used to prepare, run, and analyze the docking
simulations. Kollman united atom charges, salvation parameters and polar
hydrogens were added into the receptor PDB file for the preparation of protein
in docking simulation. Gasteiger charge was assigned to the ligand molecule
which is a non-peptide structure, and subsequently non-polar hydrogens were
merged. Grid points spacing in the grid box (x, y, and z:78, 78, and 92 Å ) was
kept at 0.375 Å. AutoGrid 4.0 Program, supplied with AutoDock 4.0 (compiled
and run under Linux operating system) was used to produce grid maps. The
best conformers, out of the total 100 studied during the docking process, were
selected on the basis of Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA). The individuals
were selected randomly with the population size of 150. Maximum number of
energy evaluation was set to 250,000,00, maximum number of generations
270,000, maximum number of top individual that automatically survived set to
1, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.8. Step sizes were 0.2 Å for
translations, 5.0° for quaternions and 5.0° for torsions. For docking simulation,
cluster tolerance was set at 0.5 Å and external grid energy was kept at 1000
kcal with maximum initial energy 0.0 kcal. A total of 10 LGA runs were
performed with the maximum number of retries taken as 10000. All the
AutoDock docking runs were performed in Intel Xeon CPU @ 3.2 GHz of HP
origin, with 2 GB DDR RAM. The molecular interactions between the ligand
(251D) and the protein (MtbDnaE1) were analyzed using “Auto-Dock Tools”
(Version 1.50).

Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis of the MtbDnaE1 amino acid sequence showed the
MtbDnaE1 to be closest to that of M. leprae 
().
However, it appears to have branched away much earlier from that of M.
paratuberculosis. Surprisingly, it showed greater closeness to its counterparts
in the bacteria of other genus such as S. coelicolor, A. aeolicus and T.
aquaticus.

Structural model and overall architecture
As the crystal structure of TaqPolIIIα (2HPI_A) is a full-length structure and
the EcoPolIIIα crystal structure (2HNH_A) is only a large fragment structure,
available PDB structure of TaqPolIIIα (2HPI_A) was used as a template to
generate the homology model of MtbDnaE1. The structural model of
MtbDnaE1 reveals that it is organized into an irregular pyramid around a
central cavity (). The quality assessment of the predicted
model by the PROCHECK program that uses the Ramachandran plot 
[],
shows that the modeled MtbDnaE1 has 89.9% residues in most favorable
regions, 9.5% residues occurring in allowed regions and 0.6% residues were
found in the disallowed regions. These values are comparable with the
stereochemical data (87.5%, 12.2 and 0.3%, respectively) of the X-ray -
resolved structure of the TaqPolIIIα. All main chain and side chain parameters
were found to be in the ‘better’ region. The observed G-factor score (-0.10) of
the present model was much above the G-factor score (-0.50) of a reliable
model. Planar groups in the modeled structure were 100% within limits. The
structure verification server such as WHAT_CHECK also validated the
modeled MtbDnaE1 structure. Thus, the modeled structure of MtbDnaE1 is
comparable to the structurally resolved polIIIα subunit of T. aquaticus.

Conserved domains
The functional domains analysis of the modeled MtbDnaE1 revealed that the
MtbDnaE1 contains three conserved structural domains. The N-terminal is
formed by the PHP (polymerase and histidinol phosphatases) domain 
[], a
putative phosphodiesterase domain (aa 11-231; TaqPolIIIα1-285). The Cterminus
of MtbDnaE1 contains OB-fold (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharidebinding
fold) domain that binds to nucleic acids. This domain is similar to the
c-terminal domain, or CTD of TaqPolIIIα (aa 1013-1220). In between the PHP
domain and OB-fold domain, MtbDnaE1 contains a highly conserved region of
499 residues (aa 263-762). In TaqPolIIIα, this region contains three domainsthe
palm (aa 286-492 and 575-622), the thumb (aa 493-574) and the fingers (aa
623-835). In MtbDnaE1, the region of 260 residues (aa 763-1023) shows no
similarity with any structural domain in Pfam. However, ˜45% residues in this
region are identical to the β binding domain of TaqPolIIIα (aa 836–1012) that
contains the internal binding site for the β-clamp 
[]. It is possible that the
region from residues 763-1023 in MtbDnaE1 also contains a α-binding
domain.

Active site residues
In all PolIIIα that have been studied, catalysis is mediated by two divalent
metal ions that are anchored by three crucial aspartate or glutamate acidic
residues. Two of the acidic residues must be adjacent or separated by a single
amino acid []. 
Based on these motifs, the MtbDnaE1 sequence was
compared to sequences of other PolIIIα sequences to identify candidates for
key active-site residues. The presence of conserved active site comprising P-DX-
D-X-D could be detected at amino acids 420-425 in the MtbDnaE1 (data not
shown). The three catalytic aspartates of MtbDnaE1 (D421, D423, and D587)
align with the three absolutely conserved aspartate residues of TaqPolIIIα
(D463, D465, and D618). Thus, like all other known polymerases, the
MtbDnaE1 is likely to utilize the same two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism
[]. 
It is likely that two of the aspartates are involved in the coordination of
the two Mg2+ ions that are critical to the phosphotransferase activity. The third
aspartate acts as a general base to activate the primer strand for nucleophilic
attack on the α phosphate group of the incoming nucleotide 
[]. Three other
conserved residues in the MtbDnaE1 (G383, S384, and K585) correspond to
the G425, S426, and K616 of the TaqPolIIIα. The glycine and serine lie in a
loop which forms part of the incoming nucleotide binding pocket and are
conserved across all the 50 PolIIIα (data not shown). The lysine forms a salt
bridge with the phosphate group of the terminal 3' base of the primer 
[] and
is absolutely conserved as a positive residue in family C polymerases. The
MtbDnaE1 consists of a cluster R410, R416, R736, K737 corresponding to the
cluster of four highly conserved arginine residues (R452 and R458 from the
palm and R766 and R767 from the fingers domain) in TaqPolIIIα that interact
with the dATP (triphosphate) and lies approximately 10Å away from the
catalytic aspartates on the palm domain [,
], with an exception of the
fourth ariginine having been replaced by lysine ().

Docking of MtbDnaE1 with 251D
Compound 251D has been shown as a potent inhibitor of bacterial replicative
DNA polymerase []. 
Further, 251D has been reported to show low in vitro
cytotoxicity []. 
Therefore, molecular docking of the homology modeled
MtbDnaE1 was performed with 251D (). In this study, semi-flexible
docking was performed, where the target protein MtbDnaE1 was kept as nonflexible
while the ligand (251D) was kept flexible to facilitate random degrees
of freedom (including torsional and spatial degrees of freedom) spanned by the
translational and rotational parameters. All the amide bonds were set rigid
while all other bonds in the ligands were allowed to rotate freely. As required
by the AutoDock, pre-calculated grid maps were assigned to each atom type,
present in the ligand. AutoGrid, a part of ADT calculates the energy of noncovalent
contacts between the protein and ligand at different grid points. In the
present study, the area of interest was selected on the basis of amino acid
residues, which are implicated in binding with the incoming nucleotides.
Thermodynamic properties like free energy of bindings (ΔGb) and inhibition
constant (Ki) were generated by docking of the 251D onto the MtbDnaE1. The
estimated free energy of bindings was -16.04 Kcal/mol and estimated inhibition
constant was 1.74pM. The 251D interacts with the active site residues (R410,
R416, R736, and K737) of the MtbDnaE1 via hydrophilic-hydrophilic contact
(hydrogen bond), hydrophobic-hydrophobic contact and hydrophobichydrophilic
contacts ( and 
Table 1 see ).
The present study thus predicts the possible interaction of the inhibitor 251D
with the MtbDnaE1, its position with respect to the active site and binding
energies to understand the nature of binding.

Conclusion
The crystal structure of full-length Thermus aquaticus PolIIIα represents the
first crystal structure of a cellular replicative polymerase which has
approximately 43% sequence identity with the MtbDnaE1. This high degree of
sequence identity led us to design the structural model of MtbDnaE1. In fact, a
protein sequence with over 30% sequence identity to a known crystal structure
can often be modeled with an accuracy equivalent to a low resolution X-ray
structure []. 
The structural model of MtbDnaE1 generated on the template
TaqPolIIIα in this study represents the first structure model of MtbDnaE1 in
the absence of its crystal structure. An evaluation of the stereochemical quality
of the modeled structure by using PROCHECK and WHAT-CHECK programs
shows the reliability of the modeled protein. The presence of conserved
catalytically active site residues D421, D423, and D587, provides insight into
the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme and indicates that it may be similar to
that of Thermus aquaticus and E. coli. Docking with the known inhibitor 251D
demonstrates the role played by the conserved active site residues in the
MtbDnaE1. As the catalytic domains of the replicative polymerases in humans
and Mycobacterium are not homologous, the active site residues of the
MtbDnaE1 can be targeted to develop novel drugs to specifically block the
Mycobacterial polymerase and thus inhibit tuberculosis progression.
