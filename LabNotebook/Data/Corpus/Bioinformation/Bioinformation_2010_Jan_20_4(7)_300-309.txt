Background
Class II human leukocyte antigen molecules (HLA II) are
glycoproteins that binds to various antigenic peptides processed by
endocytic pathway and present them to CD4+ T cells for immune
response []. The antigen binding groove is made up of 2 domains (α 1
and β 1) from α chain and β chain []. The amino acid residues lining
these domains interact with antigenic peptide residues and form a
stable HLA-II p complex which is recognized by the CD4+ T cells.
Several autoimmune diseases (good pasture's syndrome, type 1
diabetes etc.) and parasitic diseases (malaria, filariasis etc.) are
associated with CD4+ T cells involving HLA II molecules []. Class II
HLA molecules are highly polymorphic and 622 DRB alleles are listed
in IMGT/HLA database (release 2.22) []. The observed sequence
polymorphism in class II is a challenge in the design of peptide based
vaccines directed against CD4+ T cell associated diseases. An ideal
peptide based vaccine is a cocktail of peptides with broad specificity to
different ethnic groups. Thus, it is important to identify peptides with
overlapping specificity to multiple alleles covering a wide range of
ethnic diversity. It has been suggested that majority of alleles can be
covered within few HLA supertypes, where different members of a
supertype bind similar peptides, yet exhibiting distinct repertoires [].

Sette and colleagues (1998) analysed DRB1*0101, DRB1*0401 and
DRB1*0701 using a collection of 384 synthetic peptides with
competitive binding assay data (IC50). Peptide binding data for these
three alleles and nine other DRB alleles (DRB1*1501, DRB1*0405,
DRB1*0802, DRB1*0901, DRB1*1101, DRB1*1201, DRB1*1302,
DRB5*0101, DRB4*0101) were used to show overlapping peptide
binding repertoires []. Maillere and colleagues (2002) described a
new supertype for HLA DP4 alleles using DPA1*0103/DPB1*0401
(DP401) and DPA1*0103/DPB1*0402 (DP402) binding assay data
(considering IC50 values for binding affinity) of various peptides
derived from allergens, viruses, or tumor antigens []. Sette and
colleagues (2002) showed that HLA-DQA1*0501/B*0201 (DQ2.3)
and DQA1*0301/B*0302 (DQ3.2) share large overlapping peptide
binding functions (using IC50 values for binding affinity) []. They
also showed the cross reactivity of DR restricted epitopes with DQ
alleles. Thus, a significant amount of functional overlap is observed
using peptide binding assay data between different class II alleles in
multiple layers. The number of class II alleles known and defined till
is more than 1000. Therefore, it is important to establish theoretical
methods to group alleles exhibiting peptide binding functional overlap.

Lund and colleagues (2004) developed specificity weight matrices
using Gibbs sampling algorithm to define nine DRB supertypes [].
Flower and Doytchinova (2005) clustered Class II HLA alleles into
twelve supertypes (five DR, three DQ and four DP) based on
hierarchical (using similarity field generated by CoMSIA) and non
hierarchical (k-means) clustering []. Clustering of MHC peptidebinding
repertoires was utilized elsewhere for supertype definition by
Reche &amp; Reinherz (2007) []. These results provide frameworks for
understanding class II supertypes. The current update for class II
alleles is 1000 at IMGT/HLA. Therefore, it is important to develop
novel methods to group class II alleles with overlapping peptide
binding function. Here, we describe a method based on virtual pockets
defined from structural data to group HLA DRB alleles with
overlapping peptide binding repertoires. We chose DRB alleles which
constituted 62% of the class II HLA alleles known till date for this
study.

Methodology
DRB specific peptides from MHCBN database
We retrieved 1580 DRB specific immunogenic (CD4+ cytotoxicity)
peptides from MHCBN, a database of MHC binders and non-binders
[]. We then created a subset data of 1064 DRB specific peptides that
are documented to bind DRB alleles defined using sequence based
nomenclature. This corresponds to 37 DRB alleles. It should be noted
that this subset of DRB specific peptides have both binding specificity
and CD4+ cytotoxicity. The remaining 516 DRB specific peptides are
documented to bind DRB alleles defined using serological methods
without sequence level specificity. Hence, this subset is neglected in
further analysis.

DRB supertypes in MHCBN dataset
The dataset consisting of 1064 DRB specific peptides were further
analyzed to identify functional peptide binding overlap between
alleles. This exercise identified 145 peptides binding to two or more
DRB alleles, thus exhibiting peptide binding functional overlap (Table
1 in ). The 145 peptides cover 29 DRB alleles.
The grouping of DRB supertypes in MHCBN is illustrated in .

DRB allele specific sequences from IMGT/HLA database
We downloaded 622 DRB alleles (62% of known class II alleles) from
IMGT/HLA for further analysis.

Peptide binding domain
The peptide binding groove is formed by two domains each from alpha
and beta chains (). The β1 domain (first 90 residues in the N
terminal) from beta chain that constitutes the peptide binding groove is
considered for further analysis.

Virtual pockets in DRB molecules
The peptide binds with the DRB molecules through peptide residue
position specific interactions with the pockets in the groove. These
virtual binding pockets accommodate the side chains of amino acid
residues of antigenic peptides. Mohanapriya and colleagues (2009)
defined nine virtual pockets using 15 non-redundant class II HLApeptide
crystal structures []. The HLA amino acid residues lying in
these virtual binding pockets show polymorphism which determines
the specificity and sensitivity. These residue positions forming the
virtual pockets are called highly essential residue positions (HERP) as
defined elsewhere by Mohanapriya and colleagues (2009) []. The
number of HERP defined for the beta chain of class II molecules is
twenty-five.

Grouping of HLA DRB alleles for overlapping peptide binding
We extracted the residues corresponding to the 25 HERP in 622 DRB
alleles in IMGT/HLA. The sequence stretch formed by the
discontinuous HERP in 622 DRB alleles was compared among
themselves to cluster those having similar sequence stretch. Thus, we
obtained 395 groups by this procedure such that alleles within the
same group share the HERP sequence stretch. This procedure
generated 73 groups (Table 2 ) containing
two or more alleles and 322 groups with only one allele. The
hypothesis is that alleles within the group show functional overlap
thereby exhibiting potential supertypes. It should be noted that alleles
in 322 groups do not share HERP sequence stretch among them. The
workflow for the identification of DRB alleles in IMGT/HLA with
overlapping function is given in  and the grouping is shown in
.

Validation of grouping for HLA DRB alleles
 shows 32 peptides (retrieved from MHCBN) binding to
DRB1*1101 and DRB1 *1104 with CD4+ cyto-toxicity. Table 2 (see
) shows that these two alleles (DRB1*1101 and
DRB1 *1104) fall under the same category. Table 3 (see
) also shows 6 peptides (retrieved from
MHCBN) binding to DRB1*1301 and DRB1*1302 with CD4+ cytotoxicity.
Table 2 (see ) shows that these two
alleles (DRB1*1301 and DRB1*1302) fall under the same category.
Thus, peptide data in Table 3 (see ) validates
the theoretical supertype like grouping in Table 2 (see ).

Discussion
HLA-DRB alleles are associated with CD4+ T-cell immune response.
DRB alleles are polymorphic (sequence level variation) in the
population and about 622 DRB alleles are named in IMGT/HLA
sequence database till date. Each of these alleles bind short peptide
antigens with high sensitivity and specificity for CD4+ T-cell immune
response. However, it has been suggested that majority of alleles can
be covered within few HLA supertypes, where different members of a
supertype bind similar peptides, yet exhibiting distinct repertoires [].
The binding of peptides to HLA alleles is usually assessed using
competitive binding assay in IC50 values. Thus, supertypes are defined
using peptide binding IC50 values known for two or more alleles. Sette
and colleagues (1998) analysed DRB1*0101, DRB1*0401 and
DRB1*0701 using a collection of 384 synthetic peptides with
competitive binding assay data (IC50). Peptide binding data for these
three alleles and nine other DRB alleles (DRB1*1501, DRB1*0405,
DRB1*0802, DRB1*0901, DRB1*1101, DRB1*1201, DRB1*1302,
DRB5*0101, DRB4*0101) were used to show overlapping peptide
binding repertoires []. However, this study accounts for just 12
alleles, which is far less than the number of known 622 alleles. Flower
and Doytchinova (2005) clustered 347 DRB alleles into five DR
supertypes based on hierarchical (using similarity field generated by
CoMSIA) and non hierarchical (k-means) clustering []. We use the IC50 values known for two or more alleles that are made available at
the MHCBN database (database of allele specific binders and nonbinders).
We extracted 1064 HLA-DRB (sequence based definition)
specific peptides from MHCBN. 145 peptides in the dataset are found
to bind more than one allele covering 29 alleles. These alleles exhibit
supertype like function. This accounts for only 4.6% of known 622
DRB alleles till date. Therefore, it is important to develop framework
charts to group defined DRB alleles into potential supertypes with
overlapping peptide binding function. Here, we define a methodology
for grouping DRB alleles from sequence data using virtual pockets.

The binding groove in DRB molecules is formed by alpha and beta
chains (). It accommodates peptides of length 12-35 []. The
peptides bound to the groove have an extended conformation in class
II unlike class I. The sequence similarity between defined class II
alleles is more than 70% and hence their structural similarity is high
(). The receptor backbone is highly similar and only their
side-chain orientations vary. Therefore, the peptide binding specificity
is determined by the side chains influenced by polymorphism of the
MHC alleles. Mohanapriya and colleagues (2009) defined virtual
pockets using HERP extracted from HLA-peptide structural
complexes []. The hypothesis is that the 25 residues at the HERP
forming the virtual pockets are deterministic of peptide binding and its
specificity. The high degree of sequence homology between known
DRB alleles and hence their structural similarity suggests the influence
of polymorphic residues at the virtual pockets to determine peptide
specificity (). We thus theoretically grouped the known 622
DRB alleles using virtual pockets defined from structural datasets. The
grouping () using the procedure illustrated in 
produced 73 groups consisting of at least 2 alleles covering about 300
alleles. Thus, the 73 groups exhibit overlapping peptide binding
function. This grouping is validated using known peptides (32 peptides
bind to DRB1*1101 and DRB1 *1104 and 6 peptides bind to
DRB1*1301 and DRB1*1302) that are clustered within the same
groups in this study. The data presented here serves in general as a
framework for understanding peptide binding overlap in particular for
HLA-DRB supertype definition and groupings. Each DRB allele
contains nine virtual pockets by definition. Thus, the 622 DRB alleles
theoretically contain a pool of 5598 virtual pockets made of HERP
residues in the dataset. The current analysis shows that the 622 DRB
alleles accounts for only 569 unique pockets (). This
constitutes only about 10% of theoretically possible virtual pockets
suggesting overlap of virtual pockets among 90% of the remaining
pocket combinations. Thus, the study demonstrates the possible degree
of overlap within virtual pockets for potential functional overlap
among DRB alleles. The described framework finds application in the
design of epitopes with cross reactivity across DRB specific ethnic
population towards peptide vaccine development.

Conclusion
HLA DRB alleles are associated with CD4+ T-cell immune response
and relevant diseases. Design of vaccine candidates with cross
reactivity across DRB specific ethnic population requires a
consideration of peptide binding functional overlap among DRB
alleles. We grouped the known 622 DRB alleles using virtual pockets
defined from structural datasets. The grouping produced 73 groups
consisting of at least 2 alleles covering about 300 alleles. Thus, the 73
groups exhibit overlapping peptide binding function. This grouping is
validated using known peptides (32 peptides bind to DRB1*1101 and
DRB1 *1104 and 6 peptides bind to DRB1*1301 and DRB1*1302)
that are clustered within the same groups. The data presented here
serves as a framework for understanding peptide binding overlap for
HLA-DRB supertype definition and groupings.
