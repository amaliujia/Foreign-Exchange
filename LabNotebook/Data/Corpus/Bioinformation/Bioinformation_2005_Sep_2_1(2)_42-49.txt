Background
Equilibrium denatruation experiments (using temperature and chemical agents) are employed to analyze the unfolding of proteins. 
      These studies are useful in understanding monomeric protein folding. Recently, such techniques have been used to study the 
      mechanism of homodimer formation. [] Dimer folding involves both 
      intra­molecular and inter­molecular interaction, unlike monomer folding that involves only intra­molecular interaction. It is 
      known that some dimers denature from native dimer to unfolded monomers with no thermodynamically stable intermediates, whereas 
      others have folded intermediates during the process. [––] Based on the unfolding patterns, 
      homodimers are known to exist in three different states. They are (1) two­state (2S), (2) three­state with dimeric 
      intermediate 
      (3SDI) and (3) three­state with monomeric intermediate (3SMI). 2S refers to N2 ↡ 2U mechanism, 3SDI refers to N2
       ↡ I2 ↡ 2U and 
      3SMI refers to N2 ↡ 2I ↡ 2U, where N2 is the native dimer state, I is the intermediate monomeric 
      species, I2 is the intermediate 
      dimeric species, and U is unfolded monomeric state. 3SDI and 3SMI are commonly considered as three­state (3S). It is found that 2S 
      interfaces are similar to protein cores and 3SMI interfaces resemble the monomer surfaces. [] 2S and 3SMI dimerization were also studied by following the evolution of two identical 20­letter residue 
      chains within the framework of a lattice model, using Monte Carlo simulations. [
     ]
      It is found that folding of 2S sequences depend on a significantly larger number of conserved amino acids than 3SMI sequences. The 
      effects of the monomer and interface geometry on 2S and 3S association mechanism were also studied by the energetically minimally 
      frustrated Gō model. [] It is found that the native protein 3D structure is 
      the major factor that governs the choice of binding mechanism. 

Mei and colleagues investigated the importance of 2S and 3S dimers using structural and folding data. [] Apiyo and colleagues proposed (using 13 obligomers (multimers with permanent interfaces)) that small 
      obligomers (molecular mass &lt; 20 kDa) unfold through 2S. [] On the other hand, 
      large obligomers (molecular mass &gt; 35 kDa) unfold through oligomeric intermediate (3SDI) and those with intermediate size unfold 
      through monomeric intermediate (3SMI). Moreover, Levy and colleagues proposed (using 21 homodimers) that 2S and 3SMI dimers can be 
      effectively classified based on the ratio of intra­molecular/inter­molecular contacts and interface 
      hydrophobicity. [] Here, we created an extended dataset of 41 homodimers 
      (2S: 25; 3SDI: 6; and 3SMI: 10) 
      to design a methodology for the discrimination of 2S, 3SDI and 3SMI dimers using 3D structural properties.

Methods
Dataset creation
We created a dataset consisting of 41 homodimer complex structures (2S: 25; 3SDI: 5; and 3SMI: 10) 
				from Protein Databank (PDB). 
      [] The unfolding pathways for these dimers observed using thermodynamic 
      experiments were obtained from literature (). The selected homodimers are at least 40 residues per monomer. 

Analyses of 2S and 3S homodimers
Interface area
The solvent accessible surface area (ASA) was computed using the program NACCESS. [] The dimeric interface area (B) was calculated as ΔASA (change in ASA upon complex formation from monomer to dimer 
      state). [] We then calculated subunit interface area (B/2), due to the 
      two­fold symmetry of homodimer complexes. 

Interior, interface and exterior residues
Homodimer residues were classified into three categories (interior, interface and exterior) based on relative ASA. The 
      percentage relative ASA was obtained by dividing the accessible surface area by the total surface area of a side­chain in 
      an extended conformation in the tripeptide GXG. Exterior residues were defined as having a relative ASA &gt; 5%, interior residues 
      were defined as having a relative ASA &lt; 5% and interface residues were defined satisfying the conditions ΔASA 
      &gt; 1Å2 &amp; relative 
      ASA &gt; 5%. The 5% cut­off was optimized elsewhere by Miller et al. []
      

Fraction of interface to interior Hydrophobicity (Fhp)
Fhp (Fraction of interface to interior hydrophobicity) was defined by the equation (Hinf­Hext)
      /(Hint­Hext), where Hint is interior hydrophobicity, Hinf is interface hydrophobicity 
      and Hext is exterior hydrophobicity. The individual hydrophobicity values were calculated using the equation 
      Σnihi/Σni, where ni is the number of residue type i and hi 
      is hydrophobicity value (based on SES (solvent excluded surface) &amp; SAS (solvent accessible surface)) of type I, as described 
      elsewhere. []

Small and large homodimers
By definition, small homodimers were defined as those with ML (monomer length) less than the dataset mean length (185 residues). 
      By definition, large homodimers were defined as those with ML larger than the dataset mean length (185 residues).

Homodimers with small and large B/2
By definition, homodimers with small B/2 were defined as those whose B/2 is less than the dataset mean B/2 (1424 Å2). 
      By definition, homodimers with large B/2 were defined as those whose B/2 is larger than the dataset mean B/2 (1424 Å2).

Results
Distribution of 2S and 3S in a Cartesian plane of monomer length and subunit interface area
 shows the distribution of 2S and 3S in the Cartesian plane consisting of ML (monomer length) and B/2 (subunit 
      interface area). It shows that 76% of small proteins form 2S and 60% of large proteins form 3S homodimers.  also shows 
      that 68% of 2S have large interface area and 45% of 3S have small interface area. 2S have ML in the range of 45­270 residues 
      and 3S have ML in the range of 70­850 residues. However, 3SMI lie within 90­380 residues and 3SDI lie within 70­850 residues. 
      2S and 3S dimers have significantly different ML range (p = 0.05 in F test). Nonetheless, 2S and 3SMI have similar ML range 
      (p = 0.05 in F test). The dataset mean ML is 185 residues. This lies between 2S mean (125 residues) and 3S mean (282 residues). 
      Data also show that 2S and 3S ML means are different (p &lt; 0.05). The mean ML for 3SDI is 405 and this is much greater than the 
      mean ML for 2S (125) and 3SMI (208).

The B/2 range for 2S (650 ­ 2500 Å2) and 3S (300 ­ 2317 Å2) are overlapping and are not significantly different (p = 0.21). 
      However, 3SMI and 3SDI are distinguished by the B/2 range (p &lt; 0.05). 3SMI having small B/2 range (300­1550 Å2) and 3SDI having 
      large B/2 range (1350­2317 Å2) are distinguished from each other. The dataset mean for B/2 is 1424Å2, which lies between 2S mean 
      (1509 Å2) and 3S mean (1239 Å2). Interestingly, the 3SMI mean (1068 Å2) is close to 3S mean B/2 (p = 0.25) and 3SDI mean (1705 Å2) 
      is close to 2S mean B/2 (p = 0.35).

In , the distribution of 2S and 3S were divided into four regions (G1 to G4) based on the dataset mean of ML and B/2. 
      Entries in G1 are small proteins with large B/2 and entries in G4 are large proteins with small B/2 (refer to methodology section 
      for definition of small and large proteins). However, entries in G2 are small proteins with small B/2 and those in G3 are large 
      proteins with large B/2. This grouping shows 84% of homodimers in G1 are 2S and 66% of homodimers in G4 are 3S. Nevertheless, 
      homodimers in G3 there are 44% 2S and 56% 3S. Homodimers in G2 have 67% 2S and 33% 3S. It should be observed that 3S in G2 are 
      solely 3SMI. The results show that 2S and 3S are distinctly and prevalently distinguished in G1 and G4 but not as much in G2 and 
      G3. The distribution of 2S and 3S in regions G1 to G4 provide insight to their structural preference in terms of ML and B/2.

Exterior, interior and interface hydrophobicity in 2S and 3S
 gives the hydrophobicity of interior, interface and exterior residues for 2S, 3SDI and 3SMI. It also gives the mean 
      hydrophobicity of interior, interface and exterior residues for 2S, 3SDI and 3SMI in the dataset. Very small 2S (≤ 90 residues) 
      have greater interface hydrophobicity compared to interior hydrophobicity. However, this is not true with very large 2S (&gt; 90 
      residues). It is also interesting to observe that majority of 3SMI have less interface hydrophobicity compared to interior 
      hydrophobicity. Nonetheless, this is not true with a majority of 3SDI.  shows that the mean interface hydrophobicity 
      values satisfy a condition (2S &gt; 3SDI &gt; 3SMI). However, the mean interior hydrophobicity satisfy a different condition (2S &gt; 
      (3SDI = = 3SMI)). The ratio of interface to interior hydrophobicity is ˜1 for 2S and 3SDI, while it is &lt; 1 for 3SMI.

Fhp (Factor of interface to interior hydrophobicity) value in 2S and 3S
, shows that 92% of entries in G1 have high Fhp value 
				(&gt; 0.5) and 83% of entries in G4 have low Fhp
      value (&lt; 0.5). It also shows that 3S in G1 have high Fhp value and 2S in G4 have low Fhp value. 
      Interestingly,
      75% of entries in G2 have high Fhp value and 78% of entries in G3 have high Fhp value. Moreover, 
      show that 91% 2S in G1 have high Fhp value and 75% 3S in G4 have low Fhp value. However, 100% 3S (2 entries) 
      in G1 have high Fhp value and 100% 2S (2 entries) in G4 have low Fhp value. In G2, 75% of 2S have high 
      Fhp value and 67% of 3S have high Fhp value. Nonetheless, 100% 3S have high Fhp value and 50% 
      of 2S have high Fhp value in G3. The mean Fhp value for 2S and 3SDI is 1, while it is 0.5 for 3SMI. Thus, the distribution of 
      2S and 3S in the G1 to G4 regions is described.

Discussion
The mechanism of homodimer folding and binding has been investigated using denaturation experiments.[­ ]  3 dimensional 
      structures are also available for many of these homodimers with known folding and binding mechanisms (). The folding and 
      binding homodimer data collected from the literature is classified into three 2S, 3SMI and 3SDI. The study of homodimer folding 
      and binding using energy models is computational intensive and time consuming. Alternatively, study on their folding and 
      binding using structural data is found useful. [] Recently, Mei and 
      collegues documented the differences between 2S, 3SMI and 3SDI homodimers using 3S structure data. [] The study provided structural insight to the mechanism of 2S and 3S folding. However, the analysis did 
      not document parameters to differentiate 2S, 3SMI and 3SDI homodimers using structural data. In this study, we study an extended 
      dataset of homodimer complexes to distinguish 2S and 3S homodimers using structural features. Results show that 76% of small 
      proteins are 2S homodimers and 60% of large proteins are 3S homodimers. Thus, protein size plays an important role in determining 
      the pathways of homodimer folding and binding. The result also shows that 68% of 2S have large subunit interface area and 45% of 
      3S have small subunit interface area. These observations suggest the importance of protein size and subunit interface area in 
      determining the mechanism of homodimer formation.

The distribution of 2S and 3S in the G1 and G4 regions of  show difference between them based on protein size, subunit 
      interface area and Fhp. In G1, 84% dimers are 2S and 92% of dimers have high Fhp (&gt; 0.5). Thus, entries 
      with high Fhp are grouped in G1 and this region represents small proteins with large subunit interface area. Moreover, 
      91% of 2S in G1 have high Fhp. This implies that a majority of small proteins with large subunit interface area and 
      high Fhp are 2S. 3S in G1 have high Fhp and this explains the presence of exceptional 3S entries in G1. 
      Similarly, 66% of dimers are 3S and 83% of dimers have low Fhp (&lt; 0.5) in G4. Thus, entries with low Fhp 
      are grouped into G4 and this region represents large proteins with small subunit interface area. Furthermore, 75% 3S in G4 have 
      low Fhp. 2S in G4 have low Fhp and this explains the presence of unusual 2S entries in G4. Entries in G2 
      and G3 have a mixture of 2S and 3S with low and high Fhp values. This is different to the distribution in G1 and G4. 
      100% 3S and 50% 2S in G3 have high Fhp and thus dimers in G3 are not distinguished by their folding mechanisms using 
      structural parameters. The mean Fhp for 2S and 3SDI is 1, while it is 0.5 for 3SMI. The similarity between 2S and 
      3SDI in Fhp is interesting. It implies that binding after folding displayed by 3SMI resembles the association of 
      protein­protein complexes. [] However, the cooperative folding­binding 
      displayed by 2S and 3SDI resembles a single­chain folding.

Thus, we show that small homodimers with large interface area and high Fhp are prevalently 2S. Similarly, large 
      homodimers with small interface area and low Fhp are prevalently 3S. Hence, it is possible to distinguish 2S and 3S 
      dimers using 3D structural data. However, small homodimers with small interface area and large homodimers with large interface 
      area are not significantly distinguished into 2S and 3S using structural parameters ML, B/2 and Fhp. It should be 
      noted that the conclusion made in the report are based on a limited set of homodimers given in . 

Conclusions
The mechanisms of homodimer complexations have implications in drug discovery. However, elucidation of homodimer mechanism 
      using unfolding experiments is difficult. Prediction of homodimer folding and binding using structural data has application in 
      target validation. Here, we show that small proteins with large interface area and high Fhp form 2S. We also show 
      that large proteins with small interface area and low Fhp form 3S. Therefore, it is feasible to differentiate 2S and 
      3S homodimers using structural data.

          3SDI: three­state with dimeric intermediate; 3SMI: three­state with monomeric intermediate. The two dash lines through 185 
          aa and 1424Å2 represent mean monomer length and mean B/2 for all homodimers, respectively. They classify the dimers into 
          four regions (G1, G2, G3 and G4). The distributions of 2S, 3SDI and 3SMI dimers are given for each region. The value 
          within parentheses is hydrophobicity factor (Fhp), calculated by the equation (Hinf ­ Hsurf)
          /(Hint ­Hsurf), where Hinf is interface hydrophobicity, Hint is interior 
          hydrophobicity and Hsurf is surface hydrophobicity.
