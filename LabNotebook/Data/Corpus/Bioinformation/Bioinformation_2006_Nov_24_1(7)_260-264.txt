Background
Only proteins liable to surveillance by the immune system are likely 
candidate subunit vaccines. Thus, for bacteria, subcellular location can be a 
prime arbiter of immunogenicity. There are five principal subcellular locations 
in Gram- bacteria (extracellular, outer membrane, periplasmic, inner membrane, 
or cytoplasmic) and three locations in Gram+ bacteria (extracellular, membrane, 
or cytoplasmic). Components of the proteome contain signals which can direct 
proteins to one or more of these locations. Such signals are legion. They can, 
for example, be explicit sequence motifs recognised by a membrane transporter. 
They can also be coincidental physical properties that render certain proteins 
compatible with their environment and were derived through an evolutionary 
process. An organism can read such signals well enough in vivo,
 and there is thus much interest in effectively reproducing this in 
silico. Bioinformatician's have, therefore, attempted to 
identify both sequence motifs and overall physical properties of proteins 
indicative of protein subcellular location.

Many methods have attempted to predict subcellular location. There are two 
basic types of prediction method: manual construction of rules derived from 
factors thought to determine subcellular location and the application of 
data-driven machine learning methods that automatically identify factors that 
determine cellular localisation, using proteins of known location as training 
data. The degrees of accuracy differ markedly between methods and compartments, 
reflecting either a lack of data for a specific compartment or the complexity 
of factors controlling the location of certain proteins.

However, there have been few, if any, real attempts to create prediction 
methods for all such compartments, since most methods predict only a subset of 
the ‘most interesting’ locations. An exception to this is 
PSORTB, which is a sub cellular location-prediction expert system developed 
specifically for bacteria. [
] PSORTB is a modular system based on 6 prediction algorithms. A query 
protein undergoes analysis by each of the modules and the results are then 
combined. The modules that form PSORTB are: SCL-BLAST, which uses sequence 
similarity to known proteins to identify location; PROSITE, which detects 
motifs indicative of subcellular location []; HMMTOP, a method for the prediction of TM domains, 
to identify membrane proteins [
]; outer membrane protein motifs are identified using sequences 
occurring only in TM beta barrel proteins; SubLocC, a support vector machine 
based method, which assigns a cytoplasmic or non-cytoplasmic location based on 
amino acid-composition; and a hidden Markov model trained to identify signal 
peptide cleavage sites. Prediction of a query sequence location is reported as 
the likelihood that a query protein belongs to a particular compartment. PSORTB 
has a precision of 96.5% and a recall of 74.8%.

In the context of bacterial subcellular location prediction, methods based 
on Bayesian Networks (BNs) are explored in this paper. Two algorithms which 
predict all locations for Gram+ and Gram- bacteria were created. A range of 
variant methods was evaluated, with differences including the number of 
residues considered (from the N-terminal 10 residues to the whole sequence) and 
residue representation (amino acid-composition, percentage amino 
acidcomposition or normalised amino acid-composition). The accuracy of the best 
resulting BN was then compared to PSORTB.

Methodology

Data-set
An algorithm was used to mine the bacterial subset of 
SWISS-PROT release 40. [
] Initially, bacterial status was confirmed using the OC line code of 
the SWISS-PROT entry. Entries were split into Gram+ and Gram- at the 
superfamily level. The following were assigned as Gram+: actinobacteria; 
deinococcus; thermus; firmicutes; planctomycetes; and thermotogae, and the 
following assigned as Gram-: chlamydia; verrucomicrobia; cyanobacteria; 
chloroflexi; fusobacteria; nitrospirae; proteobacteria; spirochaetes; chlorobi; 
and bacteroidete. The SWISS-PROT subcellular location descriptions (lines 
labelled CC) were then searched to identify if the subcellular location was 
known. To remove proteins of uncertain location, only entries not labelled as 
‘potential’, ‘probable’, ‘
hypothetical’, ‘possibly’ or ‘by 
similarity’, were incorporated into the final data-set. A non-redundant 
data-set of proteins was obtained using CLUSTALW. [] If two or more proteins were found 
to have sequence similarity higher than 90% then all but one were 
removed from the data-set. The algorithm and subsequent CLUSTALW analysis 
produced a Gram- data-set of were 272 extracellular proteins, 375 membranous 
proteins and 1500 cytoplasmic proteins, while the final Gram+ data-set 
contained 185 extracellular, 159 outer membrane, 432 periplasmic, 273 inner 
membrane and 2480 cytoplasmic proteins.


Combined bacterial subcellular location predictor Method
When 
training the method, a variety of sequence representations were examined. Six 
different sequence lengths were used: residues 1-10 of the N-terminus, residues 
1-20, residues 1-30, residues 1-40, residues 1-50, and the whole protein 
sequence. For each sub-sequence, amino acids were represented in three ways: as 
the residues themselves, as the amino acid-composition (for each residue, the 
total number of each amino acid in the subsequence); and as the normalised 
amino acid-composition (for each amino acid, the residue composition divided by 
the total number of amino acids in the sub-sequence).

Each representation was tested with each sub-sequence length, creating 18 
Näive-Bayes networks. The amino acidcomposition and normalised 
composition sequence representations used BNs comprising 20 input nodes and 1 
output node. During training, a sub-sequence is extracted from the original 
protein sequence and its composition calculated. To train the BN for an 
individual sub-sequence, each of the 20 input nodes is assigned a different 
composition value: the first contains that of alanine, the second that of 
arginine, etc. This procedure is repeated until all sub-sequences have been 
used to train the network. The output node is given the value of the 
subcellular location of the training protein, which are different for Gram+ (5 
locations) and Gram- (3 locations).

The directed acyclic graph (DAG) required when the residue representation 
was the actual amino acid sequence, varied when different sequence lengths were 
used. A length of 10 residues required a BN with 10 input nodes, for example. 
When the whole protein sequence was used, the DAG required as many input nodes 
as the protein had amino acids. Since the same network is used for all the 
proteins of the data-set, the longest protein determined the total number of 
input nodes used. For the Gram- predictor 2248 input nodes were used and for 
the Gram positive predictor 1852 input nodes were used. The amino acids were 
converted to integers, 1 to 20 according to the alphabetical order of their 
single letter representations i.e. alanine (A) had the value 1, cysteine (C) 
was 2, etc. When training the network, the first input node takes as its value 
the first residue, the second the second, and so on until the end of the 
sequence. Input nodes that do not have a corresponding amino acid, due to the 
training sequence being shorter than the maximum length, were assigned the 
value 0. The output node is given the value of the subcellular location of the 
training protein.

Testing of the network was performed using the training set under five-fold 
cross-validation. For all networks, the negative set chosen was the equivalent 
data-set of the opposite Gram-type. To assess the predictivity of the Bayesian 
approach, the same data-sets were submitted to the PSORTB predictor.

Results and Discussion
For both Gram+ and Gram- predictors the same combination of residue 
representation and sub-sequence length produced the most accurate results: 
amino acidcomposition and a sub-sequence length of 50 residues. See  and . The accuracy of both predictors increased with increasing 
sub-sequence length, up to 50 residues. Generally, both predictors were more 
accurate when using amino acid-composition. The worst performing 
representations is the one based on residues, which tries to capture residue 
position specific information. Apparent inadequacies of the representation may 
arise from the structure of the BN DAG requiring it: the number of input nodes 
equalled the length of the longest sequence; all other sequences therefore had 
many nodes assigned a value of 0 during training. For each compartment, the 
longest sequence was many times larger than the average sequence, thus many 
input nodes for most sequences had little predictive benefit.

The sub-sequence length affected accuracy more obviously. Unsurprisingly, 
the accuracies of all locations are highest when the first 50 residues are 
considered, since this will encompass the entire length of the vast majority of 
signal sequences. Shorter lengths may neglect important regions within such 
signal peptides. Charge, length, and composition, among other properties, will 
vary between different signal sequences and can therefore be used to 
distinguish accurately between different signal peptides.

A surprising feature of the results was that in most cases the accuracy of 
amino acid-composition for the whole protein was close to the accuracy of just 
the first 50 residues. However, for the extra-cellular compartment Gram+ 
predictor, the whole protein composition had a higher accuracy. This was 
unexpected as the un-normalised composition varied significantly with sequence 
length. A possible explanation is that Gram+ extracellular sequences have a 
very different length distribution to sequences from other compartments. The 
average length of sequences from each compartment was calculated. For the Gram+ 
proteins the average sequence length of the extracellular set was 397, compared 
to 491 (membranous proteins) and 442 (cytoplasmic). Further support comes from 
the Gramsequence lengths, which were found to be 549 (extracellular), 568 
(outer membrane), 322 (periplasmic), 400 (inner membrane), and 448 (cytoplasmic)
. If the BN based on composition draws its predictivity from the atypical Gram+ 
sequence length distribution, then the accuracy for the negative set should be 
low, since sequence length is nearer that of Gram+ extracellular sequences.

Comparing the best performing multi-location BNs to PSORTB indicates that 
their accuracy is roughly equivalent; the discrepancy between predictions is 
typically low, often less than 2%. See . Exceptions include the extracellular compartment (both Gram- 
and Gram+) and membrane prediction. The prediction of extracellular location is 
more accurate for both Gram- (8.57% higher than PSORTB) and Gram+ (7.86 
higher). For membranous prediction, PSORTB has an accuracy which is 
20.54% higher than that of the Gram+ multi-location predictor. This may 
be because PSORTB is specifically trained to identify TM spanning regions.

Conclusion
Good levels of accuracy were achieved, yet PSORTB outperformed the BN 
method. Since our approach attempts to utilise a single method and sequence 
representation to capture all information relevant to bacterial subcellular 
location, the performance of the BN method reported here is most encouraging. 
When comparing our method to PSORTB, we see a single methodology competing 
against an expert system, which is specifically designed to capitalise on 
best-in-class methods. Constructing a successful multi-outcome predictive 
method is difficult. Prediction is made between input variables that are very 
difficult to separate using any method. The generally lower degree of 
prediction accuracy of the BN approach is most likely due to PSORTB applying 
many algorithms, each specifically trained to address the individual 
requirements of each particular location. Clearly, this strategy is more likely 
to produce a significantly greater level of accuracy. However, the BN method 
described here is nonetheless very competitive, notwithstanding such arguments. 
Thus, we can aver that BNs represent an important new avenue in subcellular 
location prediction and that our implementation is in itself a potential 
powerful new tool for candidate subunit vaccine selection with real utilitarian 
value.
