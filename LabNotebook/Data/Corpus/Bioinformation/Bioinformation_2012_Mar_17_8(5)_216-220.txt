Background
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder caused due to
insulin deficiency or insulin resistance. In Type 1 diabetes
autoimmune destruction of the beta cells of pancreas leads to
insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes involves insulin resistance or
decreased insulin secretion. Insulin is essential for maintaining
blood glucose and regulating carbohydrate metabolism. Insulin
receptor (IR) is a tetrameric protein consisting of two
extracellular alpha subunits and two transmembrane beta
subunits [].The binding of insulin to alpha subunit of IR causes
conformational changes in the receptor leading to the activation
of tyrosine kinase beta subunit. The activated IR has the ability
to autophosphorylate and phosphorylate intracellular
substrates that are essential for initiating other cellular
responses of insulin [–].These events lead to the activation of
downstream signaling molecules that participate in the insulin
signaling pathway []. Insulin signaling, including activation of
IR tyrosine kinase activity, is impaired in most patients with
diabetes mellitus. This resistance to insulin then leads to
hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities of the disease
[,
]. Hence, compounds that augment insulin receptor
tyrosine kinase activity would be useful in the treatment of
diabetes mellitus.

Bio-flavonoids are well-known for their multi-directional
biological activities including anti-diabetic efficacy. The
flavonoids, ubiquitous in plants, are the largest class of
polyphenols, with a common structure of diphenylpropanes
(C6-C3-C6), consisting of two aromatic rings linked through
three carbons. The six major subclasses of flavonoids include
the flavones (e.g. apigenin, luteolin), flavonols (e.g. quercetin,
myricetin), flavanones (e.g. naringenin and hesperitin),
flavanols (or catechins) (e.g. epicatechin and gallocatechin),
anthocyanidins (e.g. cyanidin and pelargonidin) and
isoflavones (e.g. genistein and daidezin) 
[]. It has been
demonstrated that flavonoids can act per se as insulin
secretagogues or insulin mimetics, by influencing the
pleiotropic mechanisms [].

Musa sapientum commonly known as ‘banana’ is widely used in
Indian folk medicine for the treatment of diabetes mellitus 
[].
The available literature confirms that flavonoids are present in
banana flowers [].The chloroform, water and ethanol extract
of Musa sapientum flowers were found to exhibit hypoglycaemic
activity in alloxan diabetic rat []. Intraperitoneal
administration of prunin (naringenin 7-O-β-D-glucoside)
produces a significant hypoglycemic effect in diabetic rats. 
[].
Chronic treatment with hesperitin and naringenin was found to
lower the blood glucose level of db/db mice []. Banana
flower extracts are able to promote glucose uptake into the cells,
which could be beneficial in diabetes mellitus. It can be
hypothesized that consumption of nutraceutical-rich extract of
banana flower could replace some amount of insulin being
taken for diabetes mellitus []. Although insulin has become
one of the most important therapeutic agents known to
medicine, there is a continuing effort to find insulin substitutes,
secretagogues, or sensitizers from synthetic or plant sources for
the treatment of diabetes mellitus []. In the present study we
have attempted to dock the banana flower flavonoids with
insulin receptor tyrosine kinase to understand the interactions.
This insilico approach can be further investigated to generate
more effective and potential insulin receptor tyrosine kinase
activators through ligand based drug designing approaches.

Methodology
Preparation of Protein and ligands:
The three dimensional structure of Insulin Receptor of
Homosapiens was obtained from Protein Database (PDB: ID
1IR3) [] .The list of Flavonoids and other compounds present
in banana flower were obtained from USDA database []. The
CID files of the ligands were obtained from NCBI Pubchem
[]. 
The list of the ligands present in the banana flower initially
used are Leucocyaniin (CID155206), Cyanidin (CID128861),
Malvidin (CID159287), Pelargonidin(CID440832),
Peonidin(CID441773), Hesperetin (CID 72281), Naringenin (CID
932), Hesperetin Triacetate (CID 457809), Hesperetin
Dihydrochalcone ( CID 147608 ), Naringenin Pelargonidin ( CID
439246), Naringenin Flavanone (CID 25244584), Hesperetin
(Anion) (CID 49859576). The energy minimization of the
prepared ligand was carried out with Swiss-PDB Viewer V.4.02.
[] Molinspiration 
[] an online tool, was used to perform
QSAR studies in order to identify important molecular
properties (logP, polar surface area, number of hydrogen bond
donors and acceptors and others), as well as prediction of
bioactivity score for the most important drug targets. Various
properties of ligands such as logP, molecular weight, H bond
donors, H bond acceptors, number of atoms were obtained.
Lipinski’s Rule of Five was then applied to select probable
ligands. Those compounds that had more than one violation (i.e
Leucocyanidin) were eliminated. Active site analysis of the
Insulin Receptor was carried out using Swiss PDB Viewer
(SPDBV) V.4.02 and from the PDB ligand Explorer.

Molecular Docking Studies
Binding mode and selectivity of Insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase with individual flavonoids, was studied by docking
softwares like Autodock 4.0 [], Autodock VINA 
[].
Autodock 4.0 uses Monte Carlo simulated annealing and
Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) to create a set of possible
conformations. LGA is used as a global optimizer and energy
minimization as a local search method. Possible orientations are
evaluated with AMBER force field model in conjunction with
free energy scoring functions and a large set of protein-Ligand
complexes with known protein-Ligand constants. The newest
version 4 contains side chain flexibility. Hydrogen atoms,
Kollman charges were added. The grid was centered in the
active site region which involves all functional amino acid
residues. Grid maps were generated using the Autogrid
Program. Docking was performed using the Lamarckian genetic
algorithm. In the present study docking was performed by
creating an initial population of 150 individuals, 5 random
torsions to each of the 150 individuals, Lamarckian Genetic
Algorithm (LGA), was implemented with a maximum of
2500000 energy evaluations. AutoDock Vina is a new opensource
program for drug discovery, molecular docking and
virtual screening, offering multi-core capability, high
performance and enhanced accuracy and ease of use. AutoDock
Vina significantly improves the average accuracy of the binding
mode predictions compared to AutoDock 4.0.

Discussion
We analyzed the interactions of the banana flower flavonoids
with insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and observed that these
compounds can activate the kinase domain since the
phosphorylated tyrosines were bound to the residues located in
the activated loop of the protein.

Structural Aspects and Interactions of IR Tyrosine kinase:
Insulin receptor is a tyrosine protein kinase that undergoes
autophosphorylation upon insulin binding. The activated
receptor phosphorylates substrate proteins on multiple Tyr
residues to propagate insulin signal transduction and insulin
action []. Three important structural regions are identified in
the intracellular part of the beta subunit. They are
juxtamembrane (JM) region, the kinase region, and the
carboxyl-terminal (CT) region. The JM region (Arg940-Leu987)
contains one autophosphorylation site; the CT region (Leu1245-
Ser1343) contains two autophosphorylation sites. The
intracellular portion of the insulin receptor, contain functional
groups that bind to the effector molecules. Insulin receptor
substrates (IRS-1, -2, -3 and -4) are the targets for insulin
receptor kinase. The JM region serves as a binding site for IRS-1.
Phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane of the insulin receptor
mediates insulin's metabolic functions. The catalytic loop is
formed by residues 1130-1137 and the activation loop comprises
of residues 1150-1171 []. Extensive studies on activated and
inactive IR tyrosine kinases indicate that in the activated state
the activation loop is tris-phosphorylated and moves out of the
active site. The phosphorylated tyrosines become hydrogenbonded
to residues in the activation loop [].

The molecular properties of ligands such as logP, molecular
weight, H bond donors, H bond acceptors, number of atoms
were obtained using Molinspiration. This tool also gives the
analysis with respect to number of violations ie deviation from
Lipinski's rule. Lipinski's Rule of Five was then applied to
select probable ligands. Those compounds that had more than
one violation (i.e Leucocyanidin) were eliminated  (see
supplementary material). Active site analysis of the Insulin
Receptor was carried out using Swiss PDB Viewer (SPDBV)
V.4.02 and from the PDB ligand Explorer. The active site
consists of residues: SER 1006, LYS 1030, GLU 1077, ASP 1083,
ASN 1137, and ASP 1150, MET 1079. Docking results indicated
that majority of the compounds bind to insulin receptor
tyrosine kinase  (see supplementary material). The
binding modes and interactions of each ligand with the
functional residues of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase were
analyzed in detail by visually inspecting the docked complexes
using PMV 1.5.2.From () it is evident that all the ligands
interact with most of the residues in the binding pocket.

Conclusions
The docked conformations of all the flavonoids indicate that
the phosphorylated tyrosines namely PTR -1158, PTR -1162
and PTR – 1163 remain in the activation loop .PTR -1158 was
bound to ASP 1156, PTR-1162 was hydrogen bonded to THR
1160 ,ARG 1164 and PTR-1163 was bound to GLY 1166 all of
which are a part of the activation loop. This structural
orientation clearly suggests that insulin receptor tyrosine
kinase in its active state. Hence it can be concluded that
theses flavonoids can be considered as activators of Insulin
Receptor Tyrosine kinase. Based on Autodock binding
energies it can be hypothesized that Hesperitin
triacetate,Naringenin,Naringenin pelargonidin and
naringinen flavonone are potent activators of IR tyrosine
kinase.
