Background
The molecular chaperones, heat-shock Proteins (HSP) are the
stress proteins involved in a multitude of proteomemaintenance
functions, including de novo folding, refolding of
stress-denatured proteins, oligomeric assembly, protein
trafficking and assistance in photolytic degradation 
[–].
Chaperones are classified according to their molecular weight
for example HSP40, HSP60, HSP70, HSP90, and HSP100 [,
].
The sequence and structure of HSPs from different organisms
show a high degree of similarity. Tuberculosis, malaria,
leishmaniasis, and trypanosomiasis affect millions of people
globally. The HSP90 of intracellular protozoan parasites like
Trypanosoma, Leishmania, Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium
affect important cellular process [–]. HSP90 triggers important
stage transitions during their life cycles of protozoan pathogens
[,
]. The primary structures of Hsp90 share a significant
homology across different organisms []. The antibiotic,
geldanamycin (GA), inhibits the HSP90-mediated
conformational maturation/refolding reaction, and results in
the degradation of HSP90 substrates []. The structure of the
geldanamycin-binding domain of HSP90 (residues 9-232)
reveals a ligand binding pocket, that is highly conserved across
diverse species []. Geldanamycin binds and adopts a compact
structure similar to that of a polypeptide chain in a turn
conformation. Here, we have generated homology models of
HSP90 protein sequences of Trypanosoma, Leishmania,
Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium. Using chemoinformatic
approaches we have designed the analogs of geldanamycin and
checked their drug like properties. We find an increase in the
affinity of the geldanamycin-analogs for the protozoan HSP90
proteins. However a decrease in the affinity for the human
HSP90 during insilico docking experiments, suggests that these
molecules may be used as drug candidate.

Methodology
Homology models of HSP90 homlogs:
Homologs of HSP90 of gi|510182|emb|CAA82765.1| heatshock
Protein [Plasmodium falciparum],
gi|322502095|emb|CBZ37178.1| heat shock Protein 83-1,
partial [Leishmania donovani], gi|320900|pir||A44983 heat
shock Protein 83 [Trypanosoma brucei] and
gi|67474857|ref|XP_653162.1| heat shock Protein 90
[Entamoeba histolytica HM-1: IMSS],
gi|153792590|ref|NP_001017963.2| heat shock Protein HSP 90-
alpha isoform 1 [Homo sapiens], were retrieved from NCBI
Protein database. The homology model structures of homolog
of HSP90 were generated using CPHmodels 3.2 of CPH Server
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/Svices/CPHmodels/). The template
(PDBID: 1YET) was selected. The template recognition was
based on Profile-Profile alignment guided by secondary
structure and exposure predictions. Modeled structures were
submitted to SAVES Server (Structural Analysis and
Verification Server (http://nihServer .mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/)
for stereochemical quality check. The server checks modeled
structure using PROCHECK, WHAT_CHECK, ERRAT,
VERIFY_3D and PROVE Tools. Modeled structures were
refined by utilizing ModRefiner TOOL
(http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/ModRefiner/).

ModRefiner is High-Resolution Protein structure refinement
tool, which can start from C-alpha trace, main-chain model or
full-atomic model. Modeled structures were compared using
Matras (MArkovian TRAnsition of Protein Structure) at
http://biunit.aist-nara.ac.jp/matras.

Analogs of Geldanamycin:
Geldenamycin structure was retrieved using the PubChem
Structure Search Tool (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search). SMILES notation of ligand geldenamiycin was
submitted to CORINA server (http: //www.molecularnetworks. com/online demos/corina_demo). CORINA is a fast
and powerful 3D structure generator for small and medium
sized, typically drug-like molecules. The ligand was further
modified by using 3D conformor tool of PubChem. SMILES
format of prepared analogs were converted to PDB format by
using corina tool. Interaction studies between Geldanamycin
and HSP90 were performed using AutoDock tool
(http://autodock.scripps.edu/). The energy scoring function of
Auto Dock was used to infer the affinity of each of the prepared
analog with their HSP90 targets.

Discussion
The chaperones, heat shock Proteins (HSP) are ubiquitous in
almost all cells. A multiple sequence alignment of HSP90
proteins of human and protozoan () using MATRAS
revealed high similarity (62-80%)  (see supplementary
material). HSP of Human showed ~ 65% of identity with all
other HSP sequences. Homology models of Protozoan and
human HSP were generated by using CPH server and validated
at SAVES server (see methodology). As expected, HSP90 model
structures were well superimposed onto each other and on the
template (PDBID: 1YET) as well (). Similar RMSD
pattern of the aligned structures showed that the homologs are
closely related  (see supplementary material). High
sequence and structural similarity prompted us to target the
ligand binding site with one common ligand, geldenamycin.
Geldanamycin has inhibitory role on Protozoa diseases but it
has also affinity for human HSP90 [].

The ligand Geldanamycin showed a binding energy of ‘- 5.09
kcal/mole’, ‘-4.57 kcal/mole’,
‘-5.42’ and ‘-4.76’ for Plasmodium,
Trypanosomes, Leishmania and Entamoeba respectively. The
ligand geldanamycin showed an affinity for human HSP90 with
a binding energy of -4.68 kcal/mole. In order to decrease the
affinity of geldenamycin for the Human HSP90 and increase
affinity for pathogens, we generated the analogs of
Geldanamycin. Various changes were incorporated in the
structure of geldanamycin and finally we selected two analogs
to target the Hsps  (see supplementary material). We
find that both analogs of GA showed an increased affinity for
protozoans, however a decreased affinity for human HSP90.
 (see supplementary material) was encouraging. An
inhibitor must follow ADME properties (absorption,
intracellular penetration, binding by plasma proteins, half -life,
metabolism and toxicity). The ADME (absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion) properties were checked using
Lipinski filter. Lipinski rule of 5 helps in distinguishing
between drug like and non drug like molecules. The analogs
showed positive result for their drug like properties 

(see supplementary material). Moreover, the higher affinity of
GA and HSPs of pathogens compared to GA- Hsp of human
showed that drug may have a selective affinity in targeting the
pathogen HSP90. Though the GA binding site of the HSP
homolgs were conserved, the interaction analysis of binding site
of HSP90 of targets with Geldanamycin and its analog showed
that diverse set of residues were involved in the interaction
with the drug molecule  (see supplementary material).
The GA-analog2 showed increased number of interaction
compared to GA and GA-analog1 in Trypanosoma and
Leishmania HSP90. The GA and its analog1 showed increased
number of interaction compared to GA-analog2 in plasmodium
HSP90. However, both of the analogs showed a decrease in
their affinity with human HSP90. These results suggest that
high throughput screening of diverse and potent variants of GA
can be further explored to target the HSPs of pathogens.
