Background
Cyclooxygenase (COX-1/COX-2) iso-enzymes were on the
pathways of prostanoids: prostaglandin and thromboxane/
prostacyclin. COX-1/ COX-2 always occur as PGI2 and TXA2 to
balance the thrombogenic factors in protective mechanisms
during normal hemostasis [,
]. COX-1/ COX-2 isoenzyme acts
downstream of the enzyme prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) and
thromboxane synthase (TXS) in catalyzing the synthesis of PGI2
and TXA2 [,
,
]. Vascular prostanoids opposing effects and
PGI2 as vasodilators are active during thrombosis. This
condition will activate platelets and promote platelet
aggregation. Thus, there is always a need for an effective
inhibitor of COX-1/COX-2.

Patchouli oil was traditionally obtained using steam distillation
of Pogostemon Herba []. The known compounds of patchouli oil
were alpha-patchouli alcohol, alpha-bulnusene, alfa-guaiene and
seychellen []. Our interest is to evaluate the potential binding of
these compounds with COX-1 using computational docking
techniques in quantitative structure activity study (QSAR). The
major compounds of patchouli oil compounds show activity of
inhibitors of enzymes and nuclear receptors ligands 
[].
Therefore, we screened these compounds from patchouli oil
using their structures from the pubchem database using the
docking techniques with COX-1 followed by visualization of
their molecular level interactions.

Methodology
COX-1 sequence:
The amino acid sequence of cyclooxgenase-1 (COX-1) with ID:
NP_000953.2 was obtained from the sequence database of NCBI
[]. The model of cyclooxgenase-1 (PGH1_human) was obtained
from the SWISS-MODEL repository []. This research protocols
were approved by the Medical Ethic Committee of Brawijaya
University as National Ethic Committee.

Ligand preparation:
We downloaded the major compound structures of patchouli
oil from NCBI PubChem. The ID of alpha-patchouli isomer:
includes CD521903, CD442384, and CD6432585, alpha-bulnusene:
CD94275, seychellen: CD519743, and alpha-guaiene: CD107152 
[].
Their energy forms were minimized and converted to PDB
format by Open Babel 2.3.1 in Hex.6.12 as ligands for virtual
screening.

Docking ligand – protein:
We used the Hex 6.12 (rigid docking) tool to compute possible
interaction COX-1 with alpha-patchouli alcohol (CD_521903) at
the interaction site. Output of rigid docking was refined using
the portable InteLigand-LigandScout Software 2.02 and the
LeadIT2 software. InteLigand-LigandScout is applied for the
identification of van der Walls (vdW) interactions.

LeadIT2 software is used to simulate the most possible native
complex structure of alpha-patchouli alcohol-COX-1 in flexible
mode with both backbone and side-chains movements.
Thereafter, we used LeadIT2 to refine the candidate models
according to an energy function followed by the hydrogen bond
calculations and analysis.

Visualization:
Visualization of the structures was performed using the
Chemira version 1.7 molecular graphics system.

Discussion
The major known compounds of patchouli oil were alphapatchouli
alcohol, alpha-bulnusene, seychellene and alfa-guaiene. The
other compounds of patchouli oil were alpha-patchoulene, alphagurjunene,
beta-caryophylene, gemacrene-D, gemacrene-A, and
viridiflorol. The 3D structures of all compounds are available in
the form file.sdf []. Thereafter file.sdf is converted into file.pdb
by Openbabel software and model viewing was performed
using the chemira 1.7s software, as shown in (. We
used molinspiration analysis to report the screening of major
compounds of patchouli oil, as given in  (see
supplementary material). The result showed that major
compounds of patchouli oil act as an inhibitor to protein
enzymes. The amino acid sequence of target human
cyclooxgenase-1 (NP_000953.2) is 93% similar to a swiss model
sequence (PGH1_human) in the database. Thus, the
corresponding homology model was downloaded for the
docking study.

The use of structural models for ligand scanning, ligand
docking and ligand activity profiling studies has been
documented []. 
Molecular model data shown in 
suggests that alpha-Patchouli alcohol (CD521903) binds to
cyclooxgenase-1 at many active sites including: Trp138.A,
Glu139.A, Ser142.A, Leu223.B, Asp228B, Leu237.B and
Arg332.B. The output of rigid docking was further refined using
portable LigandScout software (version 2.02) and LeadIT2
software. Intel LigandScout was used to identify van der Wall
(vdW) interactions in the model complexes. The van der Walls
(vdW) interaction analysis () confirmed three
interactions of alpha-patchouli alcohol (CD521903) with COX-1.

The other major compounds of patchouli oil such as alpha patchouli
alcohol (CD442384 and CD6432585) have four vdW
interactions and seychellene, alpha-guaiene and alpha-bulnusene
are only one vdW interaction. Further analysis using the LeadIT
software explain that alpha patchouli alcohol CD521903 have ten
interacting hydrogen bonds with COX-1 with Ser142A,
Glu139A, and Asp228B as shown in . Thus, the
modeling analyses of alpha-patchouli alcohol (CD521903) provide
better binding activity than the other compounds of patchouli
oil.

The best model ligand-protein complex was further simulated
for the stability of the binding interaction with and without
DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) solvent. The simulation described
that the addition of DMSO solvent interrupted the stability of
alpha-patchouli alcohol (CD521903)-COX-1 interaction complex.

This is an indication for the increased binding energy in the
CD521903-COX-1 model complex. However, a better root mean
square deviations (RMSD) of the protein complexes were
observed with added DMSO solvent  (see
supplementary material). We observed that the energies of
interaction are -6 kJ/ mol (without solvent) and -15 kJ/ mol
(with solvent DMSO) using the LeadIT software. These data
suggest that DMSO solvent have potency to abrogate alpha patchouli
alcohol (CD529013)-COX-1 interaction. Molecular
model data suggests that alpha-Patchouli alcohol as a potential
inhibitor of COX-1 pending further experimental verification.

Conclusion
The modeling analyses of major compounds in patchouli oil
suggest that alpha-Patchouli alcohol (CD521903) binds to
cyclooxygenase-1 at many active sites including: Leu223B,
Asp228B, Leu237B, Arg332B, Trp138A, Glu139A, Ser142A, and
Asn143A. Further analysis revealed that several of these
binding sites are maintained by hydrogen bonds with Ser142A,
Glu139A, and Asp228. The ligand-protein interaction energy is
favorable with values of -6 kJ/ mol (without solvent) and -15
kJ/ mol (with solvent DMSO). Thus, these theoretical data
suggests alpha-Patchouli alcohol as a potential inhibitor of COX-1
pending experimental verification for further interpretation and
conclusion.
