Background
Access to clean drinking water is key factor underpinning public healths even
in areas of the world where significant investments are made to protect water
quality []. 
We initiated a systematic screening programme to catalogue the
microbial composition of Dal Lake water at the city of heaven, Srinagar India.
In the present research communication, we report the genotypic
characterization of strain BzDS03 on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence and
16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region analysis. This kind of
genotypic technique involves the amplification of any phylogenetically
informative targets such as 16S rRNA gene for genera identification 
[] and
16S-23S rRNA for species identification []. The sequences of the rRNA is
essential for the survival of all cells and are highly conserved throughout
evolution, because they require complex inter and intramolecular interactions
to maintain the protein-synthesizing machinery []. A length of 1,184 nt, 16S
rRNA sequence of strain BzDS03 was used as query to search for homologous
sequence in the GenBank database []. Sequence analysis revealed that its
closest relative was Escherichia coli DH1 (ME8569) with 99% sequence
identity. It is known that most strains of Escherichia coli are harmless and live
in the intestines of healthy humans and animals; however some strain produces
a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness. One of the hundreds of strains of
the bacterium Escherichia coli, O157:H7 is an emerging cause of food-borne
and waterborne illness. The presence of Escherichia coli in water sample is
implicit evidence for fecal contamination and represents a threat to human and
environmental health []. 
Therefore, it is of interest to isolate novel bacterial
strain from different environments for potential applications. In this study we
describe the isolation and identification of an unknown bacterium from the Dal
Lake using 16S rRNA gene sequence and 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed
spacer (ITS) region sequence to characterize the strain BzDS03 as a member of
Escherichia coli.

Methodology
Culturing of Bacteria
Water samples were collected in sterile bottles from different location i.e.
Nishat Park, Dal Gate, hazrat-Bal of Dal lake, Srinagar. The sample was
serially diluted and spread onto peptone/Beef extract/Nacl/Agar-Agar plates
followed by incubation at 30°C under anaerobic conditions. Single colonies of
bacterial strains were picked and further grown and sub-cultured several times
to obtain a pure culture.

DNA isolation of bacteria
Pure culture of the target bacteria was grown overnight in liquid NB medium
for the isolation of genomic DNA using a method described by Hiney and
colleagues [].

PCR amplification of 16S rDNA gene
PCR reaction was performed in a gradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf,
Germany). The universal primers (Forward primer 5'-
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG -3' and reverse primer 5'-
CTTGTGCGGGCCCCCGTCAATTC-3') were used for the amplification of
the 16S rDNA gene fragment. The reaction mixture of 50 μl consisted of 10 ng
of genomic DNA, 2.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase, 5 μl of 10X PCR
amplification buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, , 500 mMKCl pH-8.3), 200μM dNTP,
10 p moles each of the two universal primers and 1.5mM MgCl2. Amplification
was done by initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 minutes, followed by 30 cycles
of denaturation at 94°C for 30 second, annealing temperature of primers was
55°C for 30 second and extension at 72°C for 1 minute. The final extension was
conducted at 72°C for 10 minutes.

PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer
PCR reaction was performed in a gradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf,
Germany). The forward primers 5' GATTAGATACCCTGGTAG 3' and
reverse primer 5' AGTCACTTAACCATACAACCC 3' were used to amplify
16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer region sequence. The reaction
mixture and reaction steps for PCR were same as for 16S rDNA amplification.

Agarose gel electrophoresis and Purification of PCR product
10 μl of the reaction mixture was then analyzed by submarine gel
electrophoresis using 1.0 % agarose with ethidium bromide at 8V/cm and the
reaction product was visualized under Gel doc/UV trans-illuminator. The PCR
product was purified by Qiagen gel extraction kit.

DNA sequencing of 16S rDNA fragment
The 16S rDNA amplified PCR product (100ng concentration) was used for the
sequencing with the single 16S rDNA 27F Forward primer: 5'-
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' by ABI DNA sequencer (Applied
Biosystem Inc).

DNA sequencing of 16S-23 rDNA ITS fragment
PCR amplified product of 16S-23S intergenic pacer (100 ng concentration) was
used for the sequencing of 16S-23S ITS region by using 5'
GATTAGATACCCTGGTAG 3' as forward primers and 5'
AGTCACTTAACCATACAACCC 3' as reverse primer (Applied Biosystem
Inc).

Computational analysis
A comparison of the 16s rRNA gene sequence and 16S-23S ITS region
sequence of the isolate with the non-redundant collection (Genbank, DDBJ,
EMBL &amp; PDB) of sequences was performed using BLAST 
[,
]. A number of
sequences of the genus Escherichia coli were aligned with both 16S rRNA
gene sequence and 16S-23S ITS region sequence of isolate with 98% sequence
similarity. We then developed a multiple sequence alignment (separately for
both 16S and 16S-23S ITS sequences) for these homologous sequences using
the algorithm described in ClustalW []. An evolutionary distance matrix was
generated from these nucleotide sequences in the dataset. Further a
phylogenetic tree was then drawn using the Neighbour joining method 
[] for
both 16S rDNA and 16S-23S ITS region. Phylogenetic and molecular
evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary
Genetics analysis) version 4.0 []. We compared the 16S rRNA gene
sequence of isolate with different set of sequence databases such as small
subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) and large subunit ribosomal RNA (lsu
rRNA) [] by using Ribosomal RNA BLAST 
[]. 16S rRNA gene sequence
of isolate was also compared against those sequences in Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) [] by using the RDP Classifier check Program 
[]. The
annotated information for the sequence in the database to which 16S rRNA
aligns was used for the bacterial identification.

Discussion
Genomic DNA was extracted from the isolated bacterial strain BzDS03. 16S
rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA ITS regions were amplified and sequenced by using
their respective primers. A total of 1,183 bp of the 16S rDNA gene and 346 bp
of 16S-23S ITS region were sequenced and used for the identification of
isolated bacterial strain. Comparison of these test sequences against nonredundant
collection of GenBank [] 
database was performed with BLAST [,
]. The BLAST result showed that the 16S rDNA sequence of isolate BzDS03
has 99% sequence similarity having highest score i.e. 2137 bits with
Escherichia coli DH1 (ME8569). The result also showed that isolate BzDS03
has 99% sequence similarity with Escherichia coli DH1, Escherichia coli
BW2952, Escherichia coli str. K12 substr. DH10B, Escherichia coli str. K12
substr. W3110 and Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 respectively.
The BLAST result of 16S-23S rDNA ITS sequence showed that the isolate has
98% sequence similarity (score=599, Expected=4e-168) with the same strain
Escherichia coli DH1 (ME8569). Subsequently, a 16S rDNA gene sequence
and 16S-23S rDNA ITS sequence based phylogenetic tree were constructed,
which shows the relationship between the isolate BzDS03 and selected
representative of genera Escherichia coli (&amp;
). It is evident from
phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA ITS sequences that the
isolate BzDS03 represents a strain in genera Escherichia coli. Further the result
of similarity rank program classifier [] available at Ribosomal Database
Project [], for 16S rDNA sequence classified the isolate BzDS03 as a novel
genomic species of the genus Escherichia coli with a confidence threshold of
95%. All these results confirm that the isolate BzDS03 belongs to genera
Escherichia coli.

Conclusion
Accurate and definitive microorganism identification is essential for a wide
variety of application including environmental studies. The rRNA sequence
based analysis is a central method to understand not only the microbial
diversity within and across the group but also to identify new strains. Bacterial
species have at least one copy of the 16S rRNA gene containing highly
conserved regions together with hyper variable regions, which is used for
identification of new strains. However a considerable variation can occur
between species in both the length and the sequence of 16S-23S rDNA ITS
region therefore this region is useful in characterization of bacterial species.
We used the 16S rRNA gene sequence and 16S-23S rRNA ITS region
sequence to characterize the bacterial isolate BzDS03 from Dal Lake, Srinagar
India as Escherichia coli strain BzDS03.
