HIV entry is mediated by envelope spikes on
the surface of the
virus., Each spike is a noncovalent trimer of gp120
and gp41 dimers. Binding of gp120 to CD4
on target cells triggers a sequence of conformational changes in the
spike that lead to binding of gp120 to the coreceptor (a member of
the chemokine receptor family, usually CCR5 or CXCR4), and consequent
fusion of the viral and cell membranes, leading to cell infection. This multistep process provides a series of targets
for blocking infection before the virus establishes a foothold in
the host.

Dual antagonist peptide
triazoles (PTs) make up a novel class of
broadly active and nontoxic, gp120 binding entry
inhibitors that simultaneously inhibit interactions of gp120 at the
binding sites for both CD4 and the coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4)., These compounds exhibit submicromolar antiviral activities against
HIV-1 clades A–D, including transmitted/founder viruses. Members
of this family bind to soluble gp120YU-2 with low
nanomolar affinity and can be synergistically combined with other
entry inhibitors., At the virus level, the PTs cause
gp120 shedding, and some variants exhibit virolytic activity. Peptide triazoles have been found to bind to
a highly conserved site that overlaps the CD4 binding site on gp120. All these properties make PTs attractive leads
for both therapeutic and microbicidal applications.

Peptide
triazoles appear to have a unique effect on gp120 conformation.
Binding of CD4 to gp120 is accompanied by an unusually large decrease
in entropy (−TΔS =
44.2 kcal mol–1). This
has been suggested to reflect a large conformational change in gp120
by structuring the latter from an ensemble of flexible unstructured
states into an activated state [i.e., the CD4-bound state (Figure a)]. In the activated
state, gp120 can be divided into an inner domain, an outer domain,
and a minidomain at the inner domain–outer domain interface
called the “bridging sheet”, where the coreceptor binds
(Figure a). Folding of the bridging sheet
has been suggested to account for half of the structuring in gp120
accompanying formation of the activated state. Peptide triazoles bind with a structuring effect on gp120
(−TΔS = 6.3 kcal mol–1) much smaller than that of CD4, and are proposed to bind to a gp120 conformation different from
that of the activated state. It has been
suggested that PTs prevent formation of the bridging sheet and effectively “trap” gp120 in
a conformation, or an ensemble of conformations, incommensurate with
formation of this functionally important domain. The PT-bound state of gp120 thus represents an inactivated
“off” state of the glycoprotein.

backbone is shown as a cartoon, with the inner domain colored red,
the outer domain blue, and the bridging sheet domain cyan. Note that
the latter is unfolded in panel b and folded into a β-sheet

Currently, there are
no crystal structures of a peptide triazole–gp120
complex, hampering efforts to understand the structural mechanism
of PT action, optimize the peptide potency, and develop non-natural
peptidomimetics through structure-based design. The inherent structural
flexibility of gp120,, combined with incomplete structuring
by noncovalently bound PTs, may explain
the lack of success to date in obtaining crystals for this complex.
One way to overcome this obstacle would be to stabilize the complex
into a less flexible state by introducing covalent bonds between the
peptide and protein components. A similar approach has been adopted
previously to determine the crystal structure of the antigen binding
fragment (Fab) of monoclonal antibody b12 with a gp120 core. mAb b12 binds gp120 with a small structuring
effect (−TΔS = 6.3
kcal mol–1) of the same order of magnitude as that
of PTs. Zhou et al. stabilized the b12–gp120 complex for crystallization,
by introducing multiple pocket filling and disulfide mutations into
gp120. We hypothesized that covalently
linking the peptide triazole to gp120 would stabilize the peptide–gp120
complex in a similar fashion.

Recently, we developed a model
of the encounter complex between
the two molecules. Here, we used that
model to guide the design and synthesis of a covalent conjugate of
a peptide triazole with gp120. This conjugate exhibits binding properties
that argue for occupancy of the PT binding pocket on gp120 by the
conjugated peptide. The intramolecularly assembled conjugate holds
promise for determining the high-resolution crystal structure of the
peptide triazole class of entry inhibitors in complex with gp120.
Such assembly of PT and gp120 components also provides experimental
support for the molecular dynamics simulation, which in turn can assist
in the rational design of peptidomimetic entry inhibitors based on
peptide triazoles.

Materials and Methods
The following
reagents were obtained from the NIH AIDS Reference
and Reagents Program, division of AIDS, National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases: anti HIV-1 gp120 monoclonal antibodies 2G12
(H. Katinger) and IgG1 b12 (D. Burton and C. Barbas).

Molecular Dynamics
Simulations
Details of the simulations
have been explained previously. Briefly,
with an all-atom, explicit solvent minimal energy structure of the
PT–gp120 core from our previous work as a starting point, a 200 ns equilibration was launched in the NVT ensemble with the aim of probing the stability of the
complex. The CHARMM22 force field was
used with NAMD version 2.7, and all molecular
analyses and image renderings were conducted in VMD version 1.9.

Protein Reagents
Soluble CD4 (sCD4)
was produced and
purified as described previously. Monoclonal
antibody 17b was obtained from Strategic BioSolutions. The wild-type
(WT) gp120YU-2 construct was created by insertion
of a V5 (GKPIPNPLLGLDST)
coding sequence N-terminal to the C-terminal His6 tag in
a pcDNA3.1 vector carrying the mammalian codon-optimized sequence
for a CM5 secretion peptide and gp120YU-2 (a gift
from N. Madani and J. Sodroski). A Glu
to Cys (E275C) mutation was introduced into the YU-2 gp120 backbone
using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene).
The primers were custom-synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT). The following primer set was used for E275C: 5′-GATCGTGATCCGGAGCTGTAACTTCACCAACAACG-3′
(forward) and 5′-CGTTGTTGGTGAAGTTACAGCTCCGGATCACGATC-3′
(reverse). Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing (Genewiz Inc.) using
the BGHR primer or a custom-made 5′-TCCCCATCCACTACTGCGCCC-3′
primer (IDT). DNA for transient transfection was purified using a
QiagenMaxiPrep kit (Qiagene) and transfected into HEK 293F cells according
to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Five days after
transfection had been initiated, cells were harvested and spun down,
and the supernatant was filtered through 0.2 μm filters. Purification
was performed over a 17b antibody-coupled column prepared using NHS-activated
Sepharose (GE Healthcare). gp120 was eluted from the column using
0.1 M glycine buffer (pH 2.4) into 1 M Tris (pH 8.0). The identity
of the eluted fractions was confirmed by SDS–PAGE and Western
blotting using antibody D7324 (Aalto Bioreagents). After the peak
fractions had been pooled, additional purification, including removal
of aggregates, was performed with a prepacked Superdex 200 HR gel
filtration chromatography column (GE Healthcare). Monomer-containing
fractions were identified by SDS–PAGE and Western blotting
with mAb D7324, pooled, concentrated, frozen, and stored at −80
°C. gp120WT was biotinylated using EZ-Link-Sulfo-NHS-Biotin,
according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, and used as a positive
control in analyses of the fusion reactions via SDS–PAGE (below).

Peptide Synthesis
Peptide triazoles (Table ) were produced by manual solid-phase synthesis
using Fmoc chemistry on a Rink amide resin at 0.25 mmol scale, purified
using reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), and validated by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) as detailed elsewhere. All preparations
were initially fractionated on a semiprep Vydac C18 column, and the
collected main peaks were then separated on an analytical Luna C18
column. For PEG-KR21 synthesis, a 19-atom PEG linker N-Fmoc-N″-succinyl-4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine
(Sigma) was introduced N-terminal to the sequence of KR21 (Table ). The cysteine-containing PT SR07C (Table ), which was used in SPR studies, was synthesized
and purified similarly. For production of the reactive AE21 peptide,
lyophilized KR21 was dissolved in methanol and reacted with the heterobifunctional
cross-linker SMPEG2 {succinimidyl-[(N-maleimidopropionamido)-diethylene
glycol] ester} (Pierce) with the latter in 40-fold excess. Typically,
the reactions were performed in 200–500 μL volumes at
a KR21 concentration of 500 μM. After being incubated for 24
h at room temperature while being vigorously mixed, the reaction mixture
was lyophilized, dissolved in triethanolamine (TEA)/acetate buffer
(pH 7.0), and immediately injected over a Luna analytical C18 RP-HPLC column (Phenomenex) with a gradient of 20 to 70% CH3CN/(TEA/acetate) over 60 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The
integrity of the product and the absence of maleimide hydrolysis were
confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. AE21 was lyophilized and stored at −20
°C as a stock solution in 4 Å molecular sieve-dried DMSO.
HPLC chromatograms and MALDI MS spectra for AE21, SR07C, and PEG-KR21
are included in the .

Competition ELISA
Peptide inhibition of binding of
sCD4 or 17b to gp120 was assessed via a competition ELISA. HIV-1YU-2 gp120 (100 ng) was adsorbed to a 96-well microtiter
plate overnight at 4 °C. After being washed three times with
PBST [1× PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v)], the plate was blocked
with 3% BSA in 1× PBS for 2 h at room temperature and then washed
three times with PBST. All further incubations before detection were
conducted in 0.5% BSA in PBS. For sCD4 competition ELISA experiments,
100 μL of sCD4 (0.1 μg mL–1) was added
to each well in the presence of increasing concentrations of peptide.
After incubation for 1 h, the plate was washed three times followed
by addition of 100 μL of biotinylated anti-CD4 antibody OKT4
(eBiosciences) at a 1:5000 dilution. After a 1 h incubation, the plate
was washed three times, and 100 μL of streptavidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase (SA-HRP) was added and incubated for 1 h. The
extent of HRP conjugate binding was detected by adding 200 μL
of 0.04% o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich)
in 0.05 M phosphate-citrate buffer for 30 min followed by measuring
the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Molecular
Devices). For 17b competition, a protocol similar to that described
above was followed, adding 100 μL of 0.1 μg mL–1 antibody to the immobilized gp120 in the presence of increasing
concentrations of the peptide. Detection was conducted using an HRP-conjugated
rabbit anti-human antibody (Millipore) at a 1:5000 (v/v) dilution
followed by OPD development.

Production and Purification of the Peptide–gp120
Covalent
Conjugate
Purified gp120 (E275C or WT) was exchanged into
reaction buffer [filtered and degassed 0.1 M PBS (pH 6.9) with 10
mM EDTA]. AE21, prepared as a concentrated solution in DMSO, was added
to the gp120 solution, and the reaction was continued typically for
4 h. The DMSO content in the reaction mixture was always kept lower
than 4% by volume. Typically, reactions were conducted in a volume
of 500 μL at gp120 concentrations of 2–10 μM. Initially,
a large excess of the reactive peptide (R1 = nAE21/ngp120 = 40) was used. However, because we observed that this led to a
higher level of nonspecific labeling with WT gp120, we significantly
reduced this ratio to 1–2. Maleimide-PEG2-biotin
(hereafter MPB, Pierce) was used as a general-purpose sulfhydryl-directed
biotinylation reagent and reacted in parallel with and similar to
AE21 with WT or E275C gp120. As a control experiment, AE21 was replaced
with the nonreactive KR21 at the same ratios.

The reaction mixture
was examined by SDS–PAGE and Western blotting. Blots were probed
with α-biotin (mouse monoclonal antibody, Sigma) or α-gp120
(D7324 antibody, Aalto Bioreagents) antibodies. After this analysis,
and to remove unreacted peptide and other reagents, the reaction mixture
was first buffer exchanged five times into 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) using
Ultracel 30K filters (Amicon). The resulting mixture (∼500
μL) was then dialyzed against a large volume (4 L) of 0.1 M
PBS (pH 7.4) using a 10 kDa MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer mini dialysis device
(Pierce). CaptAvidin-conjugated agarose beads (Invitrogen) were packed
into a small column and used for further purification of the covalent
conjugate using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). The sample
from the previous step was exchanged into 0.05 M citrate buffer (pH
4.0) via ultrafiltration using Ultracel 30K filters (Amicon). It was
then passed over the CaptAvidin column and eluted in 1 mL fractions
using 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 10.0) into 1 mL of 0.1 M PBS (pH
7.4). The identity of the eluted peaks was confirmed using SDS–PAGE
and Western blotting with a mouse α-biotin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich).
No residual unreacted AE21 peptide was detected in the final pool
of elution peaks.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Assays
SPR experiments
were performed on a Biacore 3000 optical biosensor (GE Healthcare).
All experiments were conducted at 25 °C using standard PBS buffer
(pH 7.4) with 0.005% surfactant P-20. A CM5 sensor chip was derivatized
by standard 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry, and coupling was accomplished
via ligand amine groups. For immobilization of the thiol-containing
peptide SR07C, 2-(2-pyridinyldithio)ethaneamine (PDEA) in 0.1 M borate
buffer (pH 8.5) was injected over the surface after EDC/NHS activation
of the surface dextran matrix. SR07C was coupled to this surface through
disulfide exchange. Antibody 2E3 (α-human IL5) or 2B6R (α-human
IL5R) was immobilized for use as a control surface. In surface capture
experiments, NeutrAvidin–biotin binding protein (NA; Pierce)
was immobilized on the surface through standard EDC/NHS chemistry
(above), and the reaction mixture was passed over the surface at a
rate of 5 μL/min to capture the biotinylated product. To control
for the different amounts of product captured on such a surface and
E275C-immobilized surfaces, signals were normalized to the maximal
signal from injection of 200 nM mAb D7324. For kinetic analyses, typically
200–300 RUs of protein reagents were immobilized on SPR chips,
and analytes were passed over the surface at a rate of 50–100
μL/min. Surface regeneration was achieved by a 5 μL injection
of a 10 mM HCl solution at a rate of 100 μL/min.

Data
analysis was performed using BIAEvaluation version 4.0 (GE Healthcare).
Signals from buffer injection and control surface binding were subtracted
in all experiments to account for nonspecific binding. For the determination
of kinetic parameters, we used a method similar to that used by Morton
et al. The signal from the highest concentration
of the analyte was used to calculate the off rate (kd) using a simple 1:1 binding model. For each concentration,
the association-phase data were fit to a simple 1:1 bimolecular interaction
model using BIAEval. The resulting Req values were used to fit the corresponding steady state model to
calculate equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values.

Results
Rational Design of a PT–gp120
Covalent Conjugate
Covalent conjugation of peptide triazole
to gp120 was guided by a
recently proposed atomistic model of the peptide triazole–gp120
encounter complex. In this simulation,
the peptide was bound at the junction of the inner and outer domains,
with a gp120 surface epitope overlapping the F43 pocket, and a gp120
conformation in which the bridging sheet did not form. In addition,
peptide binding was shown to prevent formation of the bridging sheet
and, associated with that, to prevent binding of CD4 and the coreceptor
(or coreceptor surrogate antibodies such as mAb 17b). Figure b shows the lowest-energy conformation of gp120
in the encounter complex of our model. This can be compared with the
CD4-bound form in Figure a.

The thiol
group on cysteine side chains provides a selective bioconjugation
target on proteins. Previous work on
disulfide stabilization of the gp120 core has identified multiple
double-cysteine mutations that minimally alter the antigenic profile
of gp120. In light of our PT–gp120
complex model, the double-cysteine mutation V275C/W96C was especially
interesting. Position 275 on gp120 (E275 in the sequence of gp120YU-2) is on a sequentially variable loop, on the conformationally
fixed outer domain of gp120 and outside the CD4 binding site. Hence, we selected this position for further
studies.

The minimal energy conformation from the initial simulation
(Figure b) was subjected to 200 ns of MD equilibrium
to
probe its stability and further refine the model. Figure S1 of the  shows the rmsd (root-mean-square
deviation) trace of heavy atoms for various peptide residues along
with the overall peptide rmsd. From this plot, one can see that the
N-terminal citrulline is substantially more flexible than the rest
of the peptide. This can be better visualized by tracing the coordinates
of the N-terminal amine nitrogen of the peptide backbone during the
equilibrium as a point of reference (Figure b). The distance from this atom to the side chain (γ-carbon)
of E275 was measured during equilibration, and from that, a distance
distribution plot was constructed (Figure S2 of the ). The mode value for the distribution
was found to be ∼17.41 Å. This suggests that if the sequence
used in the model were to be used to synthesize the reactive peptide,
there would need to be a linker of at least ∼18 Å connecting
the N-terminus of the peptide to the thiol group on E275C. Considering
that this is the linear distance between the two measurement coordinates,
we expect 17.41 Å to be a minimum for the linker length.

Previous studies have shown that the INNIXW motif is the minimal
sequence required for peptide activity. We have recently reported the binding characteristics of a biotinylated
PT variant, KR21 (Table ). The major difference between peptides UM101 [used in simulations
(Table )] and KR21 is the replacement of a
phenyl group on the triazole in the former with a ferrocenyl group
in the latter. It has been found that the hydrophobic groups are interchangeable
with only modest effects on peptide activity., Because
the biotin moiety at the C-terminus of KR21 offers a convenient handle
for downstream analysis and purification of the covalent conjugate,
we chose KR21 as the base for our conjugate production.

Considering
the arguments put forward in the previous paragraphs
for the required length of an N-terminal linker to connect the peptide
to E275C on gp120, a short (∼19 Å) PEG [poly(ethylene
glycol)] linker was introduced on the N-terminus of the peptide. We
hypothesized that the additional N-terminal amino acid on the biotinylated
peptide (KR21) compared to the modeled peptide (UM101), combined with
the flexibility of a PEG linker, would be sufficient to position a
conjugated PT close to its (modeled) binding site on gp120. The KR21
sequence lacks primary amines except on the N-terminus. Hence, we
postulated that, using a commercially available heterobifunctional
PEG linker with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and maleimide
groups on the two ends, we can couple a thiol-reactive maleimide along
with the PEG linker to the N-terminus of KR21. A scheme of the approach
to design the PT–gp120 covalent conjugate is shown in Figure .

Reaction scheme utilized to produce a gp120–PT
covalent
conjugate. In step 1, the N-terminal amine of the biotinylated peptide
KR21 was reacted with the NHS ester of the heterobifunctional cross-linker
SMPEG2 to produce a PEGylated PT bearing a reactive maleimide
moiety (AE21). Then this peptide was conjugated to E275C gp120 through
the reaction of the maleimide with the thiol group introduced on gp120
via the E275C mutation.

Expression and Characterization of a Single-Cysteine, Functional
Mutant of HIV-1 gp120
Although previous work has shown that
a double-cysteine gp120HxBc2 mutant V275C/W96C can be expressed
and is functional, no such information was available for similar single-cysteine
mutants of gp120. We chose to introduce a cysteine mutation at position
275 [E275CYU-2 (shown in Figure b with green spheres)] as a connection point on the protein
for peptide conjugation. We first tested the binding affinity of the
E275C gp120 mutant for various gp120 ligands and compared it to the
WT protein. Proteins sCD4 (soluble receptor), mAbs17b (coreceptor
surrogate/CD4-induced antibody), and b12 (CD4 binding site antibody)
were used as analytes in SPR experiments with chip-immobilized WT
or E275C gp120. Kinetic parameters were obtained () and the resulting KD values determined (Table S1 of the ). The affinities of sCD4 and 17b for
E275C are slightly reduced, though the latter still maintains nanomolar
binding affinity for these molecules. Interestingly, the affinity
of CD4 binding site mAb b12 for E275C is almost the same as that for
WT gp120. These results show that the single-cysteine mutant E275C
is functional for binding typical ligands of gp120.

The affinity
of the E275C mutant for peptide triazoles was next assessed. A C-terminal
cysteine was introduced into the peptide sequence after a short spacer
from the active core [SR07C (Table )] and
used to immobilize the peptide on the SPR chip. Serial dilutions of
purified E275C gp120 were passed over the surface, and the resulting
sensorgrams were used to extract kinetic parameters of interaction
between gp120 (WT and E275C) and PTs (Figure S3 of the ). Both proteins bind the
peptide with similar affinities, as shown by the value of the equilibrium
dissociation constant obtained from the sensorgrams (KD values of 8.3 nM for WT gp120 and 6.8 nM for E275C).
These results confirm that E275C recognizes PTs with an affinity similar
to that of WT gp120 and can be a suitable candidate for further modifications.

Synthesis and Characterization of the Biotinylated, PEGylated
PT
Maleimides react nearly exclusively with thiols in the
pH range of 6.5–7.5. In addition,
a diverse array of heterobifunctional cross-linkers with maleimide
and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester functionalities
are commercially available from various suppliers. Because the PT
variants used in this work lacked side chain primary amines, we introduced
the desired PEG linker bearing a maleimide moiety by reacting a heterobifunctional
cross-linker of suitable length through its NHS end with the primary
amine on the N-terminus of the PT. The resulting approach used to
produce a thiol-reactive PT is illustrated in Figure .

To probe the likelihood that such a reactive PT would
be functionally active, the effect of simultaneously introducing the
C-terminal biotin and N-terminal PEG linker during PT–gp120
interactions was first tested using a nonreactive, biotinylated, PEGylated
PT. Previously, it was demonstrated that the C-terminal biotin on
KR21 has a minimal effect on PT–gp120 interactions (Table ). A short PEG linker
was introduced at the N-terminus of KR21 via solid-phase peptide synthesis,
and the activity of the resulting PEG-KR21 PT was tested in a competition
assay. Fixed concentrations of sCD4 or mAb 17b were mixed with serial
dilutions of PEG-KR21, and the amount of bound sCD4 or mAb 17b was
probed using an ELISA (Figure S4 of the ). Although these data show a slight decrease in
the inhibitory potency of PEG-KR21 relative to that of KR21 for gp120–sCD4
interaction, overall the inhibitory potencies of both peptides for
the interaction of gp120 with sCD4 and 17b are fairly similar. Therefore,
introduction of the PEG linker at the N-terminus of the PT has only
minimal effects on the potency of the peptide toward both WT and E275C
gp120 proteins. These results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining
a binding-competent reactive PT.

Formation of a PT–gp120
Covalent Conjugate
The
conjugate was produced in two stages (Figure ). First, a biotinylated, PEGylated, cysteine-reactive PT (AE21)
was synthesized through conjugation of a heterobifunctional cross-linker
(SMPEG2) to KR21. In the second stage, AE21 was reacted
with E275C. After AE21 had been reacted with E275C (), the reaction mixture was analyzed
using SDS–PAGE followed by Western blotting. Because the biotinylated
peptide provides a versatile marker (biotin) uniquely identifying
the final product, the blot was probed with an α-biotin antibody.

As shown in Figure , AE21 successfully
biotinylated E275C gp120 (lane 3), as judged by the α-biotin
signal at the gp120 molecular weight mark, while KR21 (on which the
nonreactive biotinylated PT variant AE21 is based) did not show any
signal (lane 2) at the same molecular weight mark. Because the major
difference between KR21 and AE21 is the presence of the reactive maleimido
group on the latter, and considering that noncovalent intermolecular
complexes break up in the chaotropic environment of SDS–PAGE,
these results provide evidence that AE21 is reactive for conjugation
to E275C gp120.

Western blot analysis of the gp120–PT covalent
conjugate
stained with anti-biotin. (a) Reactivity of AE21 PT probed via SDS–PAGE
and Western blotting: lane 1, E275C gp120 only; lane 2, mixture of
E275C gp120 and KR21 PT [nonreactive peptide (Table )]; lane 3, mixture of E275C gp120 and MPB (commercially available
thiol-specific biotinylation reagent); lane 4, mixture of E275C gp120
and AE21 PT; lane 5, biotinylated WT gp120 (positive control). Small-molecule
reactants were used in 2-fold excess vs. their protein counterparts.

We next investigated whether binding
of the PT to gp120 improves
the efficiency of the maleimide–thiol reaction, as expected
on the basis of the established tethering approach to fragment-based
drug discovery., A commercially available, thiol-reactive
biotinylation reagent [MPB ()] was used to label the free cysteine on E275C. Biotinylation of
E275C gp120 by MPB was found to occur with yields significantly lower
than those for AE21 labeling of E275C (Figure ). This observation suggests that the affinity of AE21 for gp120,
which is provided by its PT component, improves the chemical reactivity
of the maleimide moiety, likely by localizing it close to the reactive
-SH partner on the E275C gp120 surface. These results argue that binding
of the PT to E275C gp120 significantly improves the labeling efficiency
of the latter by AE21 and promotes formation of the covalent conjugate.

To investigate whether the E275C mutation provides any benefit
for the conjugation reaction, AE21 was reacted with WT gp120 and,
in parallel, with E275C. The reaction mixtures were analyzed using
SDS–PAGE and Western blotting with an α-biotin antibody
(Figure ). To further probe the specificity
of the AE21–gp120 interaction, the reaction was performed in
the presence of increasing concentrations of KR21 (the nonreactive
base peptide for AE21). The results showed that binding of AE21 to
gp120 significantly improved the labeling of the protein as competition
for binding by KR21 led to a reduction in the labeling efficiency
(Figure , lanes 1–6). Under the same
reaction conditions, close to undetectable WT labeling was observed
(Figure , lanes 7–12). Considering
the lack of significant E275C labeling by MPB, and the thousand-fold
higher reactivity of maleimide groups toward thiols in the pH range
studied here, we conclude that using
low excess AE21:E275C ratios would all but abrogate any non-cysteine
reactions of AE21. We therefore used an R1 of 1–2 for all the following reactions.

of the reaction mixture containing E275C (lanes 1–6) or WT
(lanes 7–12) gp120 with a fixed number of AE21-reactive peptide
molecules (R1 = nAE21/ngp120 = 2, where n denotes moles) in the presence of increasing concentrations
of KR21 (the nonreactive peptide).

Overall, the results obtained indicate the successful synthesis
of a reactive PT variant, AE21’s selective noncovalent binding
to gp120, and selective reaction with E275C gp120 to form a covalent
conjugate. Together, these argue for selectivity toward the desired
site of labeling, corroborating the simulation-based design of the
complex and the choice of gp120YU-2 E275 for conjugation.

Antibody Binding Characteristics of the gp120–PT Covalent
Conjugate
Although the results described above provide evidence
that the reactive peptide triazole AE21 labels E275C, the ultimate
goal will be a conjugated E275C in which the peptide occupies its
“native” binding pocket and the protein adopts the same
conformation adopted when the peptide binds noncovalently. One way
to probe for these conformational characteristics is by testing the
binding of various antibodies to the AE21–E275C conjugate.
Binding of the peptide triazole to gp120 did not alter the binding
properties of most antibodies that bind linear epitopes on gp120 (e.g.,
D7324 to the C-terminus of gp120). In
contrast, peptide triazoles inhibited binding of most conformational
antibodies to gp120. Examples included mAbs F105 and 17b. F105 is an antibody to the CD4 binding site
(CD4bs), and 17b is a CD4-induced (CD4i)
antibody; i.e., its binding to gp120 is improved in the presence of
CD4. It has been suggested that peptide triazoles allosterically inhibit
binding of CD4i antibodies, possibly through inhibition of the formation
of bridging sheets. From this precedent,
the finding that the AE21–E275C covalent conjugate has a reduced
binding affinity for CD4bs and CD4i antibodies is expected.

Before attempting to purify the covalent conjugate, we tested for
CD4 binding with an SPR capture assay. Briefly, NeutrAvidin-biotin
binding protein () was
immobilized on an SPR chip, and the filtered and dialyzed reaction
mixture was passed over this surface. Because the only biotinylated
components in the reaction mixture are the free AE21 peptide and the
AE21–E275C covalent conjugate, and the former was removed via
extensive ultrafiltration and dialysis (), the major component captured on the SPR chip
surface was assumed to be the conjugate (any trace amounts of noncovalent
complexes are expected to be dissociated during the initial regeneration
steps following D7324 injections). sCD4 was then injected onto the
surface containing the captured conjugate. We used the SPR signal
at the end of the association phase as the representative equilibrium
signal for the binding of the sCD4 analyte to the surface. Figure a shows the amount of sCD4 bound as a function of
sCD4 concentration, for immobilized E275C gp120 compared to the NeutrAvidin-captured
AE21–E275C covalent conjugate. To correct for the different
immobilization densities of each surface, 200 nM mAb D7324 was first
passed over each surface and the sCD4 response was normalized to the
maximal response from D7324. The results show that the covalent conjugate
has sCD4 affinity significantly reduced compared to that of E275C
gp120.

Binding of different concentrations of (a) sCD4 and (b) mAb 17b
to E275C and the NeutrAvidin-captured AE21–E275C covalent conjugate,
after reference subtraction and normalization to control for the amount
of immobilized protein (). The schematics on the left side of each panel depict the assay
configuration. E275C was immobilized on the surface using standard
amine coupling (). The
AE21–E275C covalent conjugate was captured from a filtered
reaction mixture using surface-immobilized NeutrAvidin via the biotin
handle on the peptide. Different concentrations of analytes were passed
over the surfaces at a rate of 100 μL/min. Response levels at
the end of the association phase (80 s) were used as the representative
equilibrium signal at each concentration.

Binding of sCD4 to the covalent conjugate could be inhibited
by
two possible factors: (1) the presence of the peptide in its binding
pocket and consequent inhibition of sCD4–gp120 interaction
and/or (2) blocking of sCD4 binding resulting from partial steric
hindrance by the presence of the covalently linked peptide. A more
stringent test to confirm the binding pose of the peptide on gp120
was sought by assessing 17b interaction. The 17b binding site is far
from position 275 of gp120 (Figure b). Thus,
considering the size of the peptide and the linker length used here,
we surmise that binding of 17b to the bridging sheet region of gp120
is unlikely to be inhibited by steric blockade alone with a covalently
tethered peptide triazole. The binding affinity of the AE21–E275C
covalent conjugate for 17b was tested in an SPR assay similar to that
described above for sCD4. The results, in Figure b, show that, similar to the case with sCD4, the covalent
conjugate has lost its affinity for 17b, and the effect is even more
pronounced than for sCD4. The suppression of 17b binding argues that
the covalent fusion is assembled structurally with a conformationally
altered bridging sheet similar to that postulated to occur in the
noncovalent complex. Overall, the SPR
experiments show that the level of binding to both sCD4 and CD4i antibodies
is significantly reduced in the covalent conjugate.

One drawback
to the capture method used above is the uncertainty
of the extent to which the NeutrAvidin capture method itself affects
the affinity of various gp120 ligands for the AE21–E275C gp120
covalent conjugate. In addition, the control ligand (E275C) is randomly
oriented on the surface, while the covalent conjugate is oriented
on the surface through binding with NeutrAvidin. Therefore, we pursued
further purification of the conjugate using the biotin handle ().

The CaptAvidin-purified
covalent conjugate was immobilized on the
SPR chip like the E275C protein, using NHS/EDC coupling, and various
concentrations of gp120 ligands were passed over the surfaces. The
SPR signals from different sCD4 concentrations are shown in Figure a. These data argue that the covalent conjugate
does not bind sCD4 even at very high concentrations. Similar results
were obtained for 17b, showing a lack of binding to the AE21–E275C
covalent conjugate (Figure b).

Binding of different
concentrations of (a) sCD4, (b) mAb 17b, and
(c) mAb 2G12 to E275C and the purified AE21–E275C covalent
conjugate. The schematics on the left side of each panel depict the
assay configuration. After purification, the covalent conjugate was
immobilized using amine coupling, similar to that used for E275C.
The response level at the end of the association phase (130 s) was
used as the representative equilibrium signal at each concentration.
Data are from averages of two independent sensorgrams (n = 2).

Peptide triazoles have been found to
bind to gp120 in the presence of mAb 2G12, a glycan-specific, conformationally
sensitive antibody. The 2G12 binding
epitope has been suggested to include a noncontiguous patch of glycans
on the “silent face” of gp120, i.e., the face opposite
the site where mutational data and modeling results suggest that the
peptide binds., Moreover, because of its noncontiguous
binding epitope on gp120, 2G12 is considered a conformational antibody,
the binding of which is sensitive to ordered folding of gp120., An SPR experiment was conducted using directly conjugated proteins
to test for whether 2G12 could bind to the covalent conjugate in the
presence of the peptide triazole (Figure c).
As the equilibrium association signals show, binding of 2G12 to the
covalent conjugate is minimally affected by the presence of the peptide.
The 2G12 binding provides support that the covalent conjugate can
adopt a conformationally ordered state. Together, these results demonstrate
successful production of a peptide triazole–E275C covalent
conjugate with interaction properties arguing that the peptide component
is assembled intramolecularly with gp120.

Discussion
Inspired
by past studies of the stabilization of the conformationally
flexible gp120 for crystallization, we
set out to engineer a stabilized complex of gp120 and peptide triazoles
(PTs). PTs bind gp120 with a weak structuring effect, which has impeded
efforts toward crystallization of a PT–gp120 complex. One approach
to overcoming the problem of incomplete structuring by gp120 ligands
has been engineering mutations into the gp120 sequence to increase
conformational stability. For example, structure-guided pocket-filling
mutations and disulfide stitches were introduced into the core gp120
sequence to stabilize its complex with b12 and b13, two broadly neutralizing
antibodies, to determine crystal structures of the antibody complexes., Introduction of engineered mutations into the sequence of such a
flexible target protein may have the side effect of perturbing its
folding properties., We hypothesized that covalent
conjugation of the peptides onto gp120 could stabilize the protein
structure. Such a covalent conjugate might be a useful “bait”
for identifying antibodies that can co-bind with PTs by using it for
screening of sera. These antibodies can later be used to further stabilize
the complex to improve the chances of obtaining a crystallized protein
embodying the PT-bound gp120 structure.

In the absence of crystal
structures to guide conjugate design,
we turned to computational modeling of the peptide–gp120 complex,
starting with a recently developed MD-based model. In this model (Figure b), the peptide
binds at the interface of the inner and outer domains, preventing
folding of the bridging sheet and formation of the coreceptor binding
site. Analysis of a long MD equilibration of the complex showed that,
although flexible, the N-terminus of the peptide remained close to
Glu275 of gp120YU-2, which was previously mutated
to introduce a disulfide between the gp120 inner and outer domains. We hypothesized that introducing a single cysteine
at this position should lead to an expressible protein, denoted E275C
gp120, which remains functional toward typical gp120 ligands. Further,
this would allow us to use various well-established, thiol-selective
conjugation chemistries to connect the N-terminus of the peptide to
the protein covalently. A second conclusion from analyzing the modeled
structure was the need for a linker ∼18–19 Å in
length to connect the N-terminus of the peptide to gp120 at position
275.

Surface plasmon resonance analyses showed that E275C gp120
maintained
binding affinity for sCD4 and 17b, the two canonical gp120 ligands.
Furthermore, like WT gp120, E275C gp120 was recognized by the monoclonal
antibody b12. More importantly, analysis of binding of E275C gp120
to SR07C, a surface-immobilized peptide triazole variant, showed that
the peptide was able to bind to E275C with an affinity similar to
that of WT gp120. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using
E275C gp120 as a minimally altered gp120 variant containing a suitable,
selective handle for peptide triazole conjugation. Because there are
no other unpaired cysteine SH groups in WT and E275C gp120 proximal
to the functionally important and conformationally variable domains
of gp120 around the F43 pocket, this mutant may also be used for future
efforts in tethering-based strategies, to screen
for potential entry inhibitors that bind to gp120.

With the
simulated model of the noncovalent gp120–peptide
triazole complex as a guide, a modular approach was used to design
a reactive peptide triazole variant, AE21, for covalent conjugation.
A PEG linker was introduced onto the N-terminus of the peptide to
allow it to reach E275C. Our ELISA results showed that the presence
of the linker has no significant effect on the ability of the peptide
to inhibit interactions of gp120 with sCD4 and 17b, the two prototypical
gp120 ligands. Further, a maleimide moiety was introduced at the N-terminal
end of the linker for selective conjugation to the E275C thiol. A
peptide variant with a biotin at the C-terminus assisted in product
identification and purification using well-established biotin-based
approaches. Introduction of the biotin group on peptide triazoles
has recently been reported not to considerably affect the affinity
of the peptide for gp120.

Reaction
of the AE21 affinity label with the recombinantly engineered
gp120 Cys variant E275C yielded the desired covalent conjugate. Analysis
of the reaction products via SDS–PAGE and Western blotting
using an α-biotin antibody showed that the AE21 peptide reacted
with E275C and successfully biotinylated E275C. One would expect E275C
gp120 to have a reactivity toward AE21 higher than that of nonbinding
thiol-reactive molecules. This is similar to the central concept of
tethering-based approaches to small-molecule screening,, wherein the reactivity of fragments toward thiols is increased if
they have a finite affinity for the target protein. Consistent with
this assumption, a commercially available biotinylation reagent, MPB,
had negligible reactivity toward E275C gp120 (Figure ), which argues for the role of AE21–E275C binding
in improving reactivity.

As further evidence of the specific
reaction of AE21 with the E275C
thiol, we tested the reaction of AE21 with WT gp120. The results (Figure ) show that no detectable level of WT labeling by
AE21 was observed. The PEG-KR21–gp120 ELISA results (Figure
S4 of the ) provide
predictive evidence for binding of the reactive peptide AE21 to gp120.
Hence, a lack of WT gp120 labeling by AE21, combined with negligible
labeling of E275C gp120 by MPB, provides further evidence of the specific
reaction of AE21 with E275C thiol. This latter finding is consistent
with the simulation-based approach to the design of the covalent conjugate.

To evaluate binding characteristics of the PT–gp120 covalent
conjugate, the purified AE21–E275C reaction product was immobilized
on an SPR chip and binding to various gp120 ligands was measured.
If the peptide in the covalent complex occupies the same binding pocket
it occupies in a noncovalent complex with gp120, the conjugate and
the noncovalent complexes should have similar ligand binding signatures.
By SPR, we observed a reduced level of binding of sCD4 to the conjugate.
Similarly, a reduced level of binding was observed of CD4bs antibodies
F105 and b12 (data not shown), consistent with previous work on inhibition
of binding of these ligands to gp120 by the parent peptide of PTs,
12p1, and by PTs. A more stringent test of the conformational properties
of the covalent complex was mAb 17b binding, because 17b binds to
the bridging sheet in gp120 and its epitope
is far from position 275 of gp120. The SPR results reported here showed
that indeed binding of 17b to the AE21–E275C covalent complex
is completely suppressed.

Previous work has shown that antibody
2G12 does not compete with
binding of the peptide triazole to gp120. Here, SPR analysis revealed that 2G12 bound to the AE21–E275C
covalent complex. This reinforces the argument that the AE21–E275C
covalent conjugate has binding characteristics similar to those of
a noncovalently bound peptide triazole–gp120 complex.

We recognize that introduction of the highly flexible PEG linker
onto the N-terminus of the peptide might affect the conformation of
this region in the covalent conjugate compared to that of the noncovalent
complex. On the other hand, the reduction in the translational entropy
of N-terminal atoms as a result of tethering to gp120 may potentially
help to stabilize this part of the peptide, which has been found to
be tolerant to various substitutions. On the gp120 side, we cannot rule out the possibility of small,
local structural changes near the conjugation site. This might be
similar to what was observed in the gp120 inner domain of the b12–gp120
complex reported by Zhou et al. In future
designs, we can replace the hydrophilic linker with more hydrophobic
ones to better stabilize the complex for crystallization efforts.

Trimeric envelope spikes on HIV are the true targets for antibodies
and entry inhibitors. Various designs for the generation of soluble
trimers with properties that mimic the immunogenic properties of virion-associated
spikes have been attempted.− The significant progress made
in the past few years toward the identification of new classes of
anti-Env antibodies has provided increasingly more stringent requirements
for the antigenic profile of a soluble antigen.− Previous work
has shown that PTs and the 12p1 parent peptide of PTs inhibit binding
of various antibodies (F105 and 17b) to soluble trimers as well as
monomers. In addition, virus inactivation,
gp120 shedding, and membrane poration activities of PTs demonstrate that these inhibitors recognize
the trimer on the virus surface. Examination of the binding and antibody-effector
properties of PTs to those of recently emerging soluble trimer designs is needed and is currently being initiated.
A PT–trimer fusion can be a useful tool for studying the pathway
to such inactivated trimer states, through biophysical–thermodynamic
methods and ultimately high-resolution crystallography.

In conclusion,
with a simulated model of the peptide triazole–gp120
complex as a starting point, a covalent PT–gp120 conjugate
was engineered to embody intramolecular interaction properties similar
to those of a PT–gp120 noncovalent complex. The covalent PT–gp120
conjugate provides a potentially valuable tool for elucidating the
structural properties of the conformationally entrapped inactivated
state of HIV-1 Env gp120 induced by peptide triazoles, including by
high-resolution crystallographic analysis. If the conformation of
the conjugate is sufficiently stabilized, it could be crystallized
on its own, or otherwise used to select for antibodies that can co-bind
to provide additional stabilization for crystallization. The successful
design of the covalent conjugate is consistent with and hence supports
the model of the noncovalent PT–gp120 complex determined by
molecular dynamics simulation and can be used as a tool for follow-up
simulation. Finally, structures obtained by simulation or crystallographically
would be useful for the structure-based design of peptide triazole
peptidomimetics.
