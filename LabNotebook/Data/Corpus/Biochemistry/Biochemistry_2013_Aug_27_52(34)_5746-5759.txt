Access to
DNA is regulated through
post-transcriptional modifications to the histones around which DNA
is wrapped. One of the most common of these modifications is acetylation,
which occurs on 10–20 lysines per histone. Lysine acetyltransferases
(KATs) are responsible for this modification, adding an acetyl group
to specific lysine residues on the histone. Acetylation of the histones
results in an increase in negative charge and a decrease in DNA interaction,
making the DNA accessible to proteins required to initiate transcription,
DNA replication, or repair.− As such, histone acetylation must be carefully regulated to prevent
changes in chromatin structure and gene expression.

CBP and p300 are both prolific lysine acetyltransferases,
involved
in several biological pathways including neurological development, gene activation, and
the DNA damage response.− There are a number of similarities
between the two proteins: both proteins are regulators of RNA polymerase
II-mediated transcription. Both CBP and p300 are large proteins (∼300
kDa) and are structural homologues, sharing high sequence identity
in several structured regions. These regions include the histone acetyltransferase
(HAT) domain and the bromodomain, an acetyl-lysine binding domain
common to many KATs. Sequence alignments
of these HATs reveal an ∼90% homology in the KAT domain, with
an ∼93% homology in the bromodomain. Outside of these highly
conserved domains, however, homology is much lower. Additionally,
both KATs have been shown to acetylate multiple residues on each of
the four core histones,, and both are important
to healthy human growth and development.

Accumulating evidence
suggest that there are unique roles for CBP
and p300 in the cell. In mice, heterozygous inactivation of p300 leads
to more severe abnormalities in heart, lung, and small intestine formation
than inactivation of CBP., Heterozygous inactivation
of CBP, however, leads to growth retardation and craniofacial abnormalities. Human diseases arising from deficiencies of
CBP and p300 also implicate discrete function. Mutations in CBP have
been linked to Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome,,, a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder,
and fetal alcohol syndrome, while deficiencies
in p300 have been linked to aberrant levels of acetylation in multiple
cancers.− Although both proteins are expressed in almost all tissues, the
inability of p300 to compensate for the loss of CBP and vice versa
suggests an important divergence in function between CBP and p300.
Therefore, distinguishing the activities of these two proteins from
one another is an important step in understanding and treating the
diseases that they cause.

Both CBP and p300 have been shown
to acetylate multiple lysines
on various histones (on histone H3: K14, K18, K23, and on histone
H4: K5, K8, and K12),,,− suggesting the difference between the two enzymes
lies in their specificity/selectivity for the residues they acetylate:
specificity is defined as how likely one enzyme is to acetylate one
position relative to another on the same histone, while selectivity
is how likely one enzyme versus another is to acetylate a specific
residue. Differences in specificity and selectivity could account
for both the biological requirement for both proteins,,, and the difference in diseases
caused by mutation or loss of either CBP or p300.− In order to test the hypothesis that CBP and p300 exhibit different
specificities, we employed a label-free, quantitative mass spectrometry-based
method already established in our lab. Building on this assay, we have also added the ability to monitor
H4, thus allowing us to determine the specificity of residues in H4,
which in turn enables us to observe how the formation of H3/H4 (or
(H3/H4)2) alters specificity. This assay allows us to monitor
each individual acetylation site on histone H3 and H4, enabling us
to quantitate and compare the acetylation of all lysines simultaneously.
Our mass spectrometry approach is unique because it allows us to see
all acetylation events, even if they occur on sites where p300 and
CBP acetylation had not previously been reported. Additionally, the
high throughput nature of this assay lends itself to the determination
of kinetic parameters for each target site, allowing us to determine
the kcat/K1/2 of either protein for a given site. Thus, the wealth of information
that these assays provide allows us to characterize these proteins
in a way that was not previously possible.

Elucidating the differences
between p300 and CBP is important to
understanding how to treat the diseases that their deficiencies cause.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to characterize the histone acetylation
patterns of both p300 and CBP in order to determine in what ways they
are similar and, importantly, how they differ. By developing methods
to detect acetylation of histone H4, this research expands on the
label-free mass spectrometry method already established in our lab,
which allowed us to study each individual acetylated site on histone
H3. This enables us to simultaneously analyze the acetylation of multiple
lysine residues of the H3/H4 tetramer by CBP or p300 in order to compare
their histone acetylation patterns. The results of this study provide
greater insight into how CBP and p300 differentially regulate histone
acetylation and will help us to understand why p300 cannot compensate
for deficiencies in CBP and vice versa. Importantly, understanding
the kinetics of CBP and p300 and their specific targets on the histone
tetramer will provide valuable insight into treating the cancers and
neurodegenerative disorders that arise from mutations in CBP and p300.

Experimental
Procedures
Reagents
All Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO) or Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA), and the purity is the
highest commercial grade or meets LC/MS grade. Ultrapure water was
generated from a Millipore Direct-Q 5 ultrapure water system (Bedford,
MA). Recombinant histone H3 and H4 were purified and provided from
the Protein Purification Core at Colorado State University. Acetyl-CoA
was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Synthetic peptides (acetylated and
propionylated) of high purity (&gt;98%) were purchased from JPT peptide
technologies (Acton, MA) and Anaspec (Fremont, CA).

Sequence Alignment
Sequences were obtained from the
NCBI protein database. Sequence alignments for human p300 (accession: Q09472), human CBP (Q92793), as well as the p300 HAT domain
(3BIY_A) and p300 bromodomain (3I3J_A) were performed using CLC Sequence Viewer 6.

Protein
Purification
The sequence for human p300 and
human CBP, containing an N-terminal His tag, and C-terminal Strep2
and FLAG tags, was synthesized and cloned by Genewiz (Cambridge, MA)
into the pVL1393 vector for baculovirus expression. This was done
to optimize codon expression for Sf9 cells and reduce
the amount of RNA secondary structure. Utilizing the BD (Franklin
Lake, NJ) BaculoGold transfection system, the plasmid was transfected
into Sf9 cells. After successful transfection and
virus amplification, p300 was expressed in Sf9 cells
and purified using a GE Healthcare (Piscataway, NJ) HiTrap column.
The protein identity and purity were confirmed through protein staining
with Coomassie dye. The p300 construct was graciously provided by
Karolin Luger (Colorado State University).

Enzymatic Kinetics Assays
for p300 and CBP
Steady-state
kinetics for H3 and the H3/H4 tetramer were performed under identical
buffer conditions (100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 50 mM HEPES buffer
(pH 7.8) at 37 °C. Steady-state assays contained from 1 to 50
nM p300 or 0.5 to 22.5 nM CBP, varying either H3 (0.25–15 μM),
H3/H4 (0.05–20 μM), or acetyl-CoA (1–200 μM).
Assays were quenched using 4 vol of trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The
precipitate was then washed twice with 150 μL of acetone (−20
°C). Samples were dried, 2 μL
of propionic anhydride was added, and ammonium hydroxide was used
to quickly adjust the pH to ∼8. Samples were then incubated at 51 °C for 1 h followed by trypsin
digestion (overnight at 37 °C).

UPLC-MS/MS Analysis
A Waters Acquity H-class UPLC (Milford,
MA) coupled to a Thermo TSQ Quantum Access (Waltham, MA) triple quadrupole
(QqQ) mass spectrometer was used to quantify acetylated H3/H4 peptides.
The digested H3/H4 peptides were injected into an Acquity BEH C18
column (2.1 × 50 mm; particle size 1.7 μm) with 0.2% formic
acid (FA) aqueous solution (solution A) and 0.2% FA in acetonitrile
(solution B). Peptides were eluted over 11 min at 0.6 mL/min and 60
°C, and the gradient was programmed from 95% solution A and 5%
solution B and down to 80% solution A and 20% solution B in 11 min.
Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was used to monitor the elution
of the acetylated and propionylated H3/H4 peptides. The detailed transitions
of H3 have previously been reported. The
accuracy of theoretical mass transitions for SRMs was confirmed utilizing
acetylated H4 peptides. The transitions for H4 are shown in Table .

These transitions are indicative
of a double acetylation but cannot be distinguished by the precursor
ion alone. In these cases, the product ion is utilized for deconvolution.

QqQ MS Data
Analysis
Each acetylated and/or propionylated
peak was identified by retention time and specific transitions (Table ). The resulting peak integration was done using
Xcalibur software (version 2.1, Thermo). The fraction of a specific
peptide (Fp) is calculated by eq , where Is is the intensity
of a specific peptide state and Ip is
the intensity of any state of that peptide, and analyzed as previously
described.,

Data Analysis
All models were fit to the data-using
Prism (version 5.0d). The initial rates (v) of acetylation
were calculated from the linear increase in acetylation as a function
of time prior to 10% of the sum of acetylated residues. To measure
steady-state parameters for acetyl-CoA, the initial rates were calculated
based on time points where less than 10% of the acetyl-CoA was consumed
(based on a coupled assay) and where
the acetylated H3 or H3/H4 fraction is less than 0.1 times the fraction
of unacetylated H3 or H3/H4. kcat, K1/2, and the Hill coefficient (nH) were determined by fitting the equation:where [S] is the
concentration of substrate
(either H3, H3/H4, or acetyl-CoA), and [E] is the concentration of
enzyme (either CBP or p300). The nH was assumed to
be one unless the data dictated otherwise, in which case the nH was
confirmed by the equation:where f is the normalized
change in v/[E].

Results
Both CBP
and p300 acetylate many of the same positions on histone
H3,,, but little
is known about how specific or selective these enzymes are. Both of
these factors can be quantified by the specificity constant or kcat/Km for systems
displaying Michaelis–Menten type kinetics and kcat/K1/2nH for more complex systems. This
level of understanding requires not only knowing which sites are acetylated
but also quantitating acetylation at each individual site. To do this,
we employed an assay capable of monitoring all of the acetylation
sites on histone H3, that we have previously used to characterize
Gcn5, and expanded the assay to include
sites of H4. This assay has the advantage of using full-length proteins
(over peptides) and measuring both the location and amount of acetylation
in each location. Briefly, by using a QqQ mass spectrometer with selective
reaction monitoring (SRM), we are able to distinguish different modifications
on the histone fragments and can use this to quantitate the amount
of acetylation of a given lysine. This method allows us to quantitate
the fraction of a residue that is acetylated, and the utilization
of multiple SRMs allows us to observe every lysine residue of histone
H3 and H4 simultaneously.

Steady-State Acetylation of Histone H3 by
CBP and p300
To understand how the KAT activity of p300 and
CBP differ, and so
that these results could be compared with our previous findings on
Gcn5, we characterized the acetylation patterns of p300 and CBP on
histone H3. Before performing the kinetic analysis, we first determined
which sites of H3 and H4 could be acetylated by p300 and CBP, under
any conditions, even at low levels. We allowed the reaction to proceed
for long incubation times (24 h) to detect sites that may only be
acetylated at low levels/frequency. We found that both proteins acetylated
K9, K14, K18, and K23 on H3. We observed low levels of p300 acetylation
of H3K27 and CBP acetylation of H3K9; however, these sites did not
appear in our steady-state experiments because they are not acetylated
before 10% of the total substrate is acetylated. Specifically, this
means that although they are detectable at long time points, kinetic
parameters could not be determined for these sites.

Specificity
constants for CBP and p300 for each targeted lysine provide a means
to quantify and compare the preference of these enzymes for each site.
Previously, we have shown that under steady-state conditions, an enzyme
that is capable of acetylating two or more locations or residues on
the same substrate will have an impact on the ability to obtain an
accurate measurement of Km or kcat, but kcat/Km (or kcat/K1/2nH) is the correct
value to quantify targeting of a given site. To obtain these parameters, we performed steady-state assays to
determine the specificity constants of p300 and CBP for each of the
acetylated lysines in which [enzyme] ≪ [substrate]. These experiments
used saturating acetyl-CoA (200 μM) and excess substrate to
enzyme. We limited our analysis to time points when the total fraction
of acetylated histone (the sum of the fraction acetylated for every
residue) was less than 10% of the initial substrate concentration.
This approach also allows us to observe if sites such as K9 and K14,
and K18 and K23, which are on the same tryptic peptide, are acetylated
on the same histone. Under steady-state conditions, one would not
expect to observe two acetylated residues on the same histone unless
the enzyme was acting processively or that one acetylation site greatly
increases the specificity of another. In fact, we did observe a small
amount (&lt;0.1%) of K23ac after K18ac in p300-mediated acetylation
but chose not to include this fraction in the analysis, as it had
little impact on the parameters measured. We carried out a series
of time course experiments to determine v/E, which was then plotted as a function of substrate.

Under steady-state conditions (for H3), both KATs acetylated several
residues on the histone tail region of H3 (H3K9, K14, K18, and K23)
(Figure AB, ). The order of the specificity constants for CBP is K14 ≈
K18 &gt; K23, and the constants for K14 and K18, was ∼8-fold
higher
than K23 (Figure C). In addition to these
residues, p300 also acetylated K9, as well as displayed a sigmoidal
dependence on substrate concentration, with a Hill of 2–3.
The specificity, based on kcat/K1/2m, and not taking into account the Hill coefficients
for p300, reveals a preference for K18 &gt; K14 &gt; K23 &gt; K9,
with selectivity
differences up to ∼2-fold. However, when we consider that the
Hill coefficient is potentially critical for understanding selectivity
between sites, the more accurate constant is kcat/K1/2nH. This changes the order to K14 &gt; K18 &gt; K9 &gt; K23,
and the difference
is up to ∼1015-fold (Figure C). It is also noteworthy that in the presence of p300, H3K9 acetylation
levels are detectable before 10% of the substrate is acetylated, thus
allowing for kinetic analysis of this site. The same is not true with
CBP, where H3K9 levels are not detectable under these conditions.
While CBP is observed to be more enzymatically active, with kcat values up to 3-fold higher than p300, this
is likely because p300 is acetylating an additional site (K9). Comparing
the selectivity of CBP and p300, we see that p300 has a specificity
that is a factor of ∼1010 higher than CBP for K14
and K18, while on K23 CBP has a specificity that is ∼3.5 fold
higher than p300, while the advantage for K9 is undetermined (Figure D). The kinetic parameters for these experiments
are summarized in Table . By comparing the
catalytic efficiency (kcat/K1/2 or kcat/K1/2nH) to the nonenzymatic
rate of acetylation (knE), we can calculate
the catalytic proficiency, or how well
the enzyme will acetylate a specific residue compared to the highest
rate of any residue getting acetylated nonenzymatically. The catalytic proficiency values measured for
p300 and CBP range from ∼106 to ∼1018. This is compared to Gcn5, which comes in at 106 under
the same conditions for H3K14 (the site for which Gcn5 has the highest
specificity).

Next we measured the steady-state
parameters for acetyl-CoA under
saturating histone H3 concentrations (10–15 μM) (Figures A,B and). These experiments
are more complicated in the fact that, for concentrations of acetyl-CoA
that are less than the concentration of H3, we have to measure total
acetylation less than 0.1 times the total concentration of acetyl-CoA
times the concentration of histone (see ref () for details). These experiments
allowed us to determine if limiting the amount of acetyl-CoA available
to either CBP or p300 would affect their specificity. The amount of
acetyl-CoA used for these experiments falls well within previously
reported ranges for cellular acetyl-CoA concentrations. Interestingly, the order of specificity changed
from what we observed in titrating H3. For CBP we found that the order
of kcat/K1/2 is K18 &gt; K14 &gt; K23 with a range of 7–40-fold difference
in
specificity. The Hill coefficient changes this order again, where
the order of specificity based on kcat/K1/2nH is
K14 &gt; K23 &gt; K18 (Figure C); the movement
of
K18 from the first position to last is due to the large Hill coefficient
for K14 (∼6). While we did not observe a change in the order
of the kcat/K1/2 for p300 (K18 &gt; K14 &gt; K23 &gt; K9), when we compare the kcat/K1/2nH to that of the H3 titration, we observe a change
in the order
for the last two positions to (K14 &gt; K18 &gt; K23 &gt; K9) (Figure C). This results in a difference in specificity
of up to 1042-fold. This is in contrast with what we previously
observed for Gcn5, where the order of acetylation was unchanged for
either limiting acetyl-CoA or H3. Catalytic
proficiency or ((kcat/K1/2nH)/knE) for p300 goes as high as 1045 and 1032 for CBP. The differences in specificity between CBP and p300 are
also more exaggerated: with acetyl-CoA p300 has an advantage of ∼1015-fold for K14 and K18, and CBP has a ∼105-fold advantage for K23 (Figure D). This
value is too large to know for K9. The kinetic parameters for these
experiments are summarized in Table .

Determination
of steady-state kinetic parameters of CBP- and p300-mediated
acetylation of histone H3 when titrating acetyl-CoA. Experiments were
performed at 37 °C in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 50 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.8) at 37 °C. Assays for p300 contained 50 nM p300,
17.5 μM H3, and varying concentrations of acetyl-CoA (1–200

Expanding the Assay To Include Histone H4
Having characterized
the acetylation pattern of p300 and CBP on H3, we wished to expanded
our analysis to the H3/H4 tetramer. We hypothesized that formation
of the tetramer could alter the accessibility of certain residues
on H3 to CBP or p300, and thus could alter the specificity of these
proteins. Additionally, both KATs are known to acetylate H4 residues.
The addition of alternative targets for these enzymes could also potentially
alter their specificities. In order to effectively characterize the
activity on tetramer, however, we needed to develop new SRMs for the
detection of H4 acetylation. The details on these SRMs can be found
in the , and the detailed
transitions are summarized in Table .

Steady-State
Analysis of p300 and CBP Specificity on the H3/H4
Tetramer
H4 alone aggregates at low concentrations (&lt;1
μM) and thus will not function as a proper substrate on its
own. Therefore, these experiments were performed utilizing the H3/H4
tetramer. As before, prior to performing experiments under steady-state
conditions, we allowed reactions with either p300 or CBP with the
H3/H4 substrate to occur for 24 h. We then determined that both p300
and CBP are capable of acetylating four lysine residues on H4: K5,
K8, K12, and K16 (data not show). Also as before, we observed a small
amount (&lt;0.1%) of double acetylation events (K5/K8, and K12/K16),
this time in p300- and CBP-mediated acetylation and chose not to include
this fraction in the analysis, although doing so had little impact
on the parameters measured. We began our steady-state experiments
with p300 and CBP by varying the histone (H3/H4) substrate concentration
(Figures A,B and). Starting with CBP, looking at just the kcat/K1/2 without consideration
for cooperativity, on H3 we see a specificity of K18 &gt; K14 &gt;
K23.
On the tetramer, we see that H3K18 is significantly higher (503.61
× 103 M–1 s–1) than either H3K14 or H3K23 (50.33 and 15.53 × 103 M–1 s–1, respectively). The
order of specificity for p300 mimics that of CBP (K18 &gt; K14 &gt;
K23).
However, comparing the acetylation pattern of p300 to CBP on the H3/H4
tetramer, we see a stark contrast between the two. While p300 specificity
is almost evenly distributed between K14, 18, and 23 (with a difference
of less than 1.1-fold between K18 and K23), CBP highly prefers K18
(with a difference of 103-fold between K18 and K23).

acetylation of histone H3/H4 when titrating H3/H4. Experiments were
performed at 37 °C in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 50 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.8) at 37 °C. Assays contained from 1 to 50 nM p300
or 1 to 22.5 nM CBP, with varying concentrations of H3/H4 (0.2–10
μM) and constant (200 μM) acetyl-CoA. Experiments were
quenched with 4 vol of TCA and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Sites
displaying the highest specificity (kcat/KmnH) for
either CBP or p300 where chosen for representative graphs. (A) Nonlinear

difference in change in free energy (ΔΔG) between CBP and p300 at each site of H3 and H4. The Y-axis is inverted to more clearly show favorable (−ΔG) changes. All quantified sites can be found in . The apparent kinetic
parameters are summarized in Table .

When considering cooperativity,
the difference between p300 and
CBP becomes even more pronounced (Figure C).
On the tetramer, CBP demonstrates cooperativity for H3 acetylation
while p300 does not. Taking this into consideration, the (kcat/K1/2nH) for K18 is 1034 times higher for CBP
than p300 (Figure D). The specificity of CBP
is 1011 and 1014 times higher than p300, respectively,
for H3K14 and H3K23 (Figure D).

The
same samples that were analyzed for H3 acetylation on H3/H4
were simultaneously analyzed for H4 acetylation (Figures  and). Focusing on
H4, we observe several differences between the activity of p300 and
CBP. CBP shows a strong preference for H4K5 (with a kcat/K1/2 of 217.15 ×
103 M–1 s–1),
followed by K8, K12, and K16, with a difference of ∼50-fold
between K5 and K16. The kcat/K1/2 for p300 are closer to each other than for CBP, with
the order of specificity being K12 (15.49 × 103 M–1 s–1) &gt; K8 &gt; K5 &gt; K16,
with a difference
in specificity between K12 and K16 being ∼4-fold. We noted
that CBP demonstrates cooperativity on H4K5 and H4K12, while p300
does not display cooperativity on H4. This results in an ∼1015-fold advantage for CBP when aceylating H4K12 (Figure D). Taking all of this information into consideration,
when we look at the kcat/K1/2nH, we see that the order
of specificity for CBP on all sites of the tetramer is H3K18 ≫
H4K5 ≫ H4K12 &gt; H2K23 &gt; H2K14 &gt; H4K8 &gt; H4K16 (Figure C). This is compared to p300, which demonstrates
no cooperativity, with an order of specificity of H3K18 ≈ K3H14
≈ H3K23 &gt; H4K12 &gt; H4K8 &gt; H4K5 &gt; H4K16 &gt; H3K9
(Figure C). The kinetic parameters for these
experiments
are summarized in Table .

As with H3,
we also performed acetyl-CoA titrations where H3/H4
tetramer concentrations and enzyme concentrations were kept constant
(Figure A,B, ). Under these conditions, the order of specificity,
not taking into consideration cooperativity, for CBP is K18 &gt; K14
&gt; K23, which is the same as the H3/H4 substrate titration. Despite
the order being the same, the preference for K18 acetylation is not
as pronounced when titrating acetyl-CoA, with only an ∼3-fold
preference over the second highest site, K14. When titrating acetyl-CoA,
p300 displays the same order of specificity as CBP (but with the addition
of K9), K18 &gt; K14 &gt; K23 &gt; K9. However, under these conditions
we observe
a stronger preference of p300 for H3K18, with the kcat/k1/2 being over 2.5-fold
higher than second highest site, K14, instead of being approximately
equal.

Determination of steady-state kinetic parameters of CBP- and p300-mediated
acetylation of histone H3/H4 when titrating acetyl-CoA. Experiments
were performed at 37 °C in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 50

50 nM p300, 7.5 μM H3/H4, and varying concentrations of acetyl-CoA
(1–200 μM). Assays for CBP contained 20 nM CBP, 10 μM
H3/H4, and varying concentrations of acetyl-CoA (1–200 μM).
Experiments were quenched with 4 volumes of TCA and boiled at 95 °C
for 5 min. Sites displaying the highest specificity (kcat/KmnH) for either CBP or p300 where chosen for representative graphs.

(D) The log of the ratio of specificity (CBP/p300) between CBP and
p300 at each site of H3 and H4. All quantified sites can be found
in . The apparent
kinetic parameters are summarized in Table .

Under these conditions we note
that CBP still shows cooperativity
for most sites (excluding H3K23 and H4K8). p300, which demonstrated
no cooperativity when substrate was limiting, now displays cooperativity
on the H4 sites. Thus we see a change in the order of kcat/K1/2nH for both CBP and p300. CBP preferentially acetylates: H4K16
&gt; H3K18 &gt; H4K5 &gt; H4K12 &gt; H3K14 &gt; H3K23 &gt; H4K8 (Figure C). The movement of H4K16 from the last position
to the first
is due to its Hill coefficient being 0.6 higher than any other site.
When titrating acetyl-CoA, the order of specificity for p300 changes
significantly from the H3/H4 substrate titration and becomes: H4K16
&gt; H4K5 &gt; H4K8 &gt; H4K12 &gt; H3K18 &gt; H3K14 &gt; H3K23 &gt;
H3K9 (Figure C). The increase in specificity
for the H4 sites
are because p300 demonstrates cooperativity at these sites, but not
on the H3 sites of the tetramer. Because of this cooperativity, we
see that there is a higher specificity for p300 on H4K5, H4K12, and
H4K16 ranging from 1018 to 1023-fold higher
than CBP (Figure D). Meanwhile, CBP has an
advantage acetylating H3K14 (∼106-fold), K18 (∼108-fold), and K23 (∼13-fold) (Figure D).

Comparison of p300 and CBP Acetylation of
H3 Compared to H3/H4
Finally, using the data obtained from
these experiments, we sought
to determine how specificity of CBP and p300 changed on the tetramer
compared to H3 alone. To do so, we examined the ratio of (H3/H4)/H3,
which are themselves calculated from the kcat/K1/2nH.
Because we have no point of comparison for H4 alone (as it aggregates),
only sites of H3 were considered. When we analyze the substrate titrations
involving CBP, it is clear that CBP has a much higher preference for
H3/H4 (Figure A). Acetylation by CBP on K18
of the H3/H4 tetramer is ∼1031-fold more favorable
than on H3 alone. K14 is ∼108-fold more favorable,
while K23 is ∼1012-fold more favorable. The opposite,
however, is true when acetyl-CoA is limiting (Figure C). H3 is favored over H3/H4 on all three sites, ranging from
∼105–1020-fold more favorable
on H3.

specificities (kcat/K1/2nH(app)) of CBP on H3 when

on H3 when substrate (black) or acetyl-CoA (light gray) is limited,
or on H3/H4 when substrate (dark gray) or acetyl-CoA (dark gray border)
is limited.

For p300, the H3 substrate
is almost always preferred to H3/H4
(Figure B,D). The exception is under conditions
of limiting substrate on H3K23, where there is an ∼4.5-fold
advantage on the H3/H4 tetramer. When substrate is titrated, the preference
for H3 alone compared to H3/H4 as a substrate ranges from ∼104-fold (K9) to ∼1010-fold (K14 and K18).
There is an even stronger preference for H3 alone when acetyl-CoA
is limiting, with the highest preference at 1020-fold for
K14.

The observed cooperativity of histone acetylation changes
with
the histone complex. When substrate is limiting, we observe cooperative
dependence on histone H3 with p300, but not CBP, while the dependence
on H3/H4 displays cooperativity with CBP but not p300. This cooperativity
plays a large part in the preference of CBP for H3/H4 substrate and
in the preference of p300 for H3. Overall we see that changing the
substrate from H3 to H3/H4 tetramer or varying whether we limit acetyl-CoA
levels or substrate has a marked affect on the ability of both p300
and CBP to acetylate the residues of H3 and H4 (Figure E,F). It is interesting to note that while the specificity
for some sites decrease, others increase. The potential importance
of these changes is explored further in the discussion.

Discussion
Here we have observed significant differences in the specificity
of CBP and p300 histone acetylation. We have shown that although both
preferentially acetylate similar residues they have very different
specificities. Using our label-free, quantitative method, we were
also able to determine the kinetics for these proteins at several
other sites of histone H3 and H4. We have also shown that these selectivities
are affected by acetyl-CoA levels and can be altered by the formation
of histone complexes. Understanding how the activities of these two
enzymes differ is the first step in understanding why they cannot
compensate for each other in an organism deficient in either protein,
while determining how these specificities can be alter is important
in deciphering how the histone epigenetic code is written.

These
steady state experiments reveal several differences in specificity
between p300 and CBP. The large increases in specificity (up to 1031-fold) are mostly a result of an increase in the apparent
cooperativity, which results in a much larger denominator when calculating
the specificity constant (kcat/K1/2nH). The origins
of cooperativity in this system are likely complicated, but some possibilities
are precluded by our data: if cooperativity were truly a function
of either histone or acetyl-CoA binding in a specific complex, resulting
in a specific residue being acetylated, then one would expect that
one particular site would begin to out compete others. This would
result in what would appear to be product inhibition at certain residues,
or in other words as the v/E increased
for the site with the higher Hill coefficient, the v/E would begin to decrease for sites with a smaller
Hill coefficient. This is not what we observe under conditions where
we detect cooperativity for one site and not another site; we see
no signs of the major v/E decrease
that we would expect from this type of mechanism. Another possibility
is that we are observing the dimerization of H3 or H3/H4, resulting
in the appearance of cooperativity. This has been seen before with
Nap1 binding H3/H4, but if this were
the case we would expect to see a similar Hill coefficient for all
sites where the catalytic efficiency is enhance by dimerization. However,
it is possible that certain sites are less or more sensitive to the
dimer form of the substrate, which we cannot rule out. Another interesting
possibility is that the enzyme is in multiple conformations or isomerization
states, all of which are catalytically active at different rates but
are slow compared to the catalytic reaction, with the rate of isomerization being influenced by substrate. This
model would make biological sense in the fact that proteins could
bind p300 or CBP to act as allosteric regulators, altering their specificity
for particular lysines. Together, these observations may suggest mechanisms
by which both the chromatin conformation and factors interacting with
p300 or CBP could alter the residues acetylated, opening a wide field
of investigation into factors that influence enzyme specificity. Regardless
of the mechanism behind this observed cooperativity, we believe that
it is an important factor in determining the specificity of p300 and
CBP, and as such will focus our discussion on our calculations that
take into consideration the Hill coefficient.

In analyzing the
specificity data, it is important to first draw
attention to the magnitude of the differences in selectivity between
CBP and p300. As we mentioned previously, different diseases arise
due to mutations in either CBP or p300, suggesting that one protein
is incapable of fully substituting for the other. As we see that both
proteins target the same residues, it is likely that it is the ratio
of acetylation that is the important marker of these proteins’
activities. For CBP, acetylation of H3K18 is much greater than any
other site on H3, with a specificity that is a factor of 1014 greater than the second most abundant site (H4K5). For p300, though,
the specificity for each site is much closer, with only a tiny ∼1.05-fold
difference between K18 and the next most abundant site (H3K14). Additionally,
the acetylation of K9 is much higher for p300, with K9 not detectable
for CBP before 10% of the histone is acetylated. All of these factors
combined mean that p300 and CBP, despite targeting the same sites,
will do so to different degrees of efficacy; while p300 will acetylate
K9, 14, 18, and 23 in a more evenly distributed fashion, CBP will
heavily favor K18 acetylation, to the detriment of the other sites,
just as we see with H3K9. Because of these differences, we can speculate
that it is these more subtle activities that are ultimately used in
the cell to distinguish KATs from each other. Indeed, it has been
shown that p300 plays a role in acetylation of H3K9 in vivo and is important to maintaining the balance between methylation
and acetylation at this site. Meanwhile,
more evidence points to the importance of CBP in maintaining levels
of H3K18 acetylation: recent work has shown that inactivation of CBP
by phosphorylation leads to a marked decrease in H3K18 acetylation.

Though weak, it is likely that the acetylation
of H3K9 is still
an important part of the activity of p300 and potentially CBP. The
relevance of this site is emphasized by the fact that K9 hypoacetylation
has been noted in a number of human cancers., Our results suggest that because p300 targets H3K9, it could potentially
be used by the cell to compensate for decreases in H3K9 acetylation.
Indeed, it has been shown that the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic
acid (VPA) leads to a p300 associated increase in K9 acetylation in
embryonic stem cells. Additionally, VPA
has been shown to be successful in treating several cancer types,
including cervical cancer.,

In addition to
weak H3K9 acetylation, we noted that if we allowed
p300 to acetylate well past steady-state conditions (hours instead
of minutes), we were able to detect low levels of H3K27 acetylation
(as has been previously reported in vivo()). However, we observe that the level of acetylation
of H3K27 was significantly lower than the other sites we have detected
(data not shown). Additionally, under steady-state conditions, no
acetylation is detected at this site before 10% of the histone is
acetylated. Considering the noted presence of the H3K27 mark in vivo,, it is likely that some cofactor
(possibly a histone chaperone ()) is influencing
p300 acetylation of this site.

When comparing the steady-state
experiments where either H3/H4
is limiting or acetyl-CoA is limiting, it is worth noting that the
specificity of both CBP and p300 changes. For CBP, when titrating
H3/H4 the order of specificity for H3 acetylation is K18 &gt; K23
&gt; K14.
Meanwhile, for p300, titrating H3/H4 leads to almost identical specificities
for K18, K23, and K14. When titrating acetyl-CoA, however, a clear
order emerges of K18 &gt; K14 &gt; K23 for both KATs. Similarly, we
see
a change in the acetylation order of H4 both with CBP and p300 when
comparing H3/H4 titrations versus acetyl-CoA titrations (Figure ). In addition, the difference in specificity from
the highest to the lowest residue decreases when acetyl-CoA is limited,
compared to when histone is limited. For CBP, specificity varies by
a factor of 1032 when titrating H3/H4 compared to a factor
of 1011 when titrating acetyl-CoA. These changes that are
observed when acetyl-CoA are limited could be indicative of a mechanism
for altering histone acetylation patterns when, for example, nutrient
intake is limited. Such a change could potentially correlate with
the upregulation/downregulation of certain genes in response to limited
energetic intake. Previous studies have already found a link between
metabolism and histone acetylation. It
is an interesting possibility that metabolism influences histone acetylation,
which in turn affects gene expression, a mechanism with the potential
to aid survival under less than ideal metabolic conditions.

Similarly, we also note the relative increase in H4 specificity
between substrate and acetyl-CoA titrations with both p300 and CBP
(Figures  and ). When
acetyl-CoA is limited, the distinct possibility exists that not all
sites that can be targeted by these proteins will be acetylated. The
higher specificity for H4 sites would ensure that these sites are
preferentially targeted when acetyl-CoA is limited. In this way, H4
marks would be preserved even in adverse metabolic conditions, which
implies an importance for these marks. We also note that even under
limited acetyl-CoA conditions, CBP maintains a high specificity for
H3K18 (Figure C), further stressing the role
of CBP in maintaining this histone mark.

Histone complexes/conformation
can also influence CBP and p300
specificity; we observe changes to the specificity of p300 and CBP
depending on whether the substrate is the H3/H4 tetramer or just H3
alone. Under conditions of limiting histone and p300, specificity
for H3K18 decreases slightly (by 1.4-fold) when the tetramer is formed,
but the kcat/K1/2 for H3K14 and H3K23 both increase on the tetramer (∼4.5-fold
for each). Observing a higher specificity for a site when H3 is alone
is not necessarily surprising, as without the additional H4 sites
for p300 to target, we would expect to see an increase in acetylation
of the H3 sites. Seeing a higher specificity for a site on the H3/H4
tetramer (as is the case for K14 and K23) is less expected. While
it is unclear why there would be this drop on H3, it is possible that
confirmation changes as a result of the formation of the H3/H4 tetramer
could make K14 a sterically more viable target. This study, as well
as previous work from our lab, noted that H3K4 was rarely targeted
for acetylation, possibly due to its ability to more readily sample
different conformations. In other words, while it is important for
a residue to be accessible to the KAT, too much conformational freedom
could be detrimental to KAT binding (and therefore acetylation). This
could also explain the change in behavior of p300 for K14: it is possible
that formation of the tetramer limits the conformational freedom of
K14, which could account for the increase in acetylation of this site
on the H3/H4 tetramer.

With the information currently available
in the field, it is difficult
to know exactly what the biological reason is for the change in specificity
of CBP to be more uniform on histone H3 alone when substrate is limited.
We believe that the increase in specificity that we observe for H3K14
and H3K23 is important to newly synthesized histones, or that they
could be important to histone assembly. The reason for this is that,
in the cell, the most readily available free H3 would be from newly
synthesized histone that has yet to be assembled into a nucleosome.
Therefore, it is under these conditions that an increase of H3K14
and H3K23 acetylation would be the most relevant. Supporting this
idea is the fact that in Drosophila, K14 and K23
acetylation is detected on newly synthesized H3, although these modifications can vary from organism to
organism. An alternative explanation is that instead of high levels
of K14 and K23 acetylation being an important epigenetic marker, it
could be key to not have disproportionally high levels of K18 during
histone assembly, and that is why the acetylation pattern of CBP is
more evenly distributed on H3 alone, although this has yet to be seen.

Investigating the acetylation pattern of p300 and CBP, it is interesting
to observe how many sites on H3 (and H4) are efficiently acetylated,
as compared to previous published data on Gcn5, which has a single,
highly preferred site of acetylation, followed by acetylation of secondary
sites. A protein that targets fewer sites is likely to have less utility
as it can perform fewer functions. At the same time, though, as with
Gcn5, having fewer targets means that the site that is targeted has
a stronger signal that stands out significantly compared to other
sites that it targets. Understanding why some KATs have such high
specificity for a particular site while others are more evenly distributed
across several residues could be key in unraveling the histone code.
An important component to doing so is elucidating the mechanism behind
how KAT specificity is regulated. Seeing the disparity in specificity
between such highly homologous proteins as CBP and p300 may hold the
key to understanding the factors within a protein that determine specificity.

In summary, this study has revealed several important facts about
the specificity of p300 and CBP and how it is regulated. Although
both KATs are capable of acetylating the same residues of H3 and H4,
p300 and CBP both display unique specificities for each lysine residue,
under a variety of conditions. Changing the histone substrate from
H3 alone to the H3/H4 tetramer clearly influences this order of specificity,
although the targeted sites remain the same. Limiting acetyl-CoA concentrations
also affects the specificity of these proteins and also alters their
order of specificity on H3 and H4. The results presented here distinguishing
the targets and specificity of CBP and p300 provide valuable insight
into how these enzymes differentially acetylate the histone. Such
knowledge could be invaluable for treating the cancers and neurodegenerative
disorders that arise from mutations in either CBP or p300. Ultimately,
if we can understand how to better manipulate p300 KAT activity to
mimic that of CBP and vice versa, we may be able to overcome some
of the detrimental effects that result from mutations in either.
