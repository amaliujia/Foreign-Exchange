The proper level of protein
tyrosine phosphorylation, maintained by the coordinated and reciprocal
activities of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPs), is important for the regulation of signaling
pathways that control various developmental processes as well as cell
growth, differentiation, metabolism, motility, and survival., Not surprisingly, perturbation of the delicate balance between the
actions of PTKs and PTPs often leads to abnormal tyrosine phosphorylation,
which is responsible for the pathogenesis of many human diseases,
including cancer, diabetes/obesity, and autoimmune disorders.,− By catalyzing the removal of phosphate from tyrosine,
PTPs are usually perceived as negative regulators of cell signaling,
which is often driven by tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated events.
Interestingly, the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing protein
tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by Ptpn11,
has been shown to play a positive role in signal transduction.− Genetic and biochemical studies reveal that SHP2 acts downstream
of growth factor and cytokine receptors and upstream of RAS, a critical
node in many signaling pathways that underlies growth factor/cytokine-induced
cell proliferation, migration, and survival.− Importantly, SHP2’s phosphatase
activity is required for activation of the RAS-ERK1/2 (extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2) pathway.,

SHP2 consists of two tandem SH2 domains at its N-terminus, a PTP
domain in the middle, and a C-terminal tail. SHP2 is an allosteric
enzyme whose phosphatase activity is regulated by an elegant “molecular
switch” mechanism., In its basal state,
SHP2 is autoinhibited because of an intramolecular interaction between
its N-SH2 and PTP domains, which blocks the entrance of the substrate
to the active site., Upon growth factor or cytokine
stimulation, the N-SH2 domain binds tyrosine-phosphorylated sequence
motifs in receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, or more commonly
scaffold proteins, which localize SHP2 to the vicinity of its substrates
and simultaneously weaken the N-SH2 domain–PTP domain interaction,
liberating the PTP domain to catalyze substrate turnover.,

The importance of SHP2 to human health is supported by genetic
observations linking SHP2 mutations to several pathological conditions.
Somatic activating mutations in SHP2 are associated with various types
of leukemia, and solid tumors.− Germline SHP2 mutations cause autosomal dominant developmental disorders,
including 50 and 90% of documented Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD
(an acronym for its clinical features of multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic
conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonic stenosis,
abnormalities of genitalia, retardation of growth, and deafness) syndrome
(LS) cases, respectively.− Other than the presence of multiple lentigines, which
is a hallmark of LS, NS and LS share similar clinical features such
as short stature, craniofacial malformations, and congenital heart
abnormalities.

More than 40 NS-associated SHP2 mutations have
been described,
affecting 30 different residues located in or close to the N-SH2 domain–PTP
domain interface., In general, NS-associated SHP2
mutants display gain-of-function (GOF) phenotypes with heightened
RAS-ERK1/2 pathway activation, likely because of elevated phosphatase
activity caused by disruption of the autoinhibitory interaction between
the N-SH2 and PTP domains.− By contrast, 11 LS-associated SHP2 mutations that alter seven different
residues, all residing in the PTP domain, have been identified. Unlike
NS mutants, the LS-associated SHP2 mutants are reported to exhibit
reduced phosphatase activity and are deemed loss-of-function (LOF)
variants.,, An obvious
unresolved question is how mutations that incite opposite effects
on SHP2 phosphatase activity elicit overlapping disease phenotypes.
To address this question, we postulated that disease-causing SHP2
mutations affect not only SHP2 phosphatase activity but also its molecular
switching mechanism, and thus, detailed comparative analysis of the
structure and function of wild-type and mutant SHP2 enzymes will yield
insight into the biochemical basis that underlies the pathological
processes potentiated by the mutant enzymes. Our initial investigation
of the most recurrent LS-associated SHP2 mutant Y279C revealed that
although Y279C is catalytically impaired and exists in a closed conformation,
the Y279C mutation weakens the interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP
domains. The weakened interaction between
the two domains in Y279C results in an increased level of binding
between the N-SH2 domain and its pTyr ligands. Consequently, Y279C
stays longer with the scaffolding protein Gab1, thus prolonging substrate
turnover, which compensates for the reduced phosphatase activity,
leading to sustained RAS-ERK1/2 activation. Collectively, the data
show that although the Y279C mutant has a lower catalytic activity,
the mutation also perturbs the “molecular switch” mechanism
of SHP2 to engender a GOF phenotype. However, given the diverse nature
of the reported LS SHP2 mutations, it is essential to determine if
these LS-associated SHP2 mutations similarly contribute to the pathogenesis
of LS in the same manner as the Y279C mutant. This is an important
issue, because the structural requirement and substrate specificity
of LS-associated SHP2 mutants could be different from each other;
thus, targeting SHP2 in LS may require different strategies. Herein,
we describe a detailed structural and mechanistic characterization
of the LS-associated SHP2 mutants (Y279C, A461T, G464A, T468M, R498L,
Q506P, and Q510E) covering all seven known LS mutation sites.

Materials
and Methods
Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Proteins
The
SHP2 wild-type catalytic domain (CD, residues 224–528), the
full-length lacking the C-terminal tail (FL, residues 1–528),
and the N-SH2 domain (residues 4–103) were cloned into the
pET-21a+ vector using NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes (NEB), which
generated recombinant proteins with a C-terminal six-His tag. The
SHP2 catalytic domains and full-length constructs lacking the C-terminal
tail containing individual LS mutations (Y279C, A461T, G464A, T468M,
R498L, Q506P, and Q510E) were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia
coli BL21(DE3). Proteins used for kinetic or inhibition assays
were purified using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen); the purities were &gt;90%
as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and Coomassie staining. Proteins
used for crystallography studies were first purified with Ni-NTA resin,
followed by sequential chromatography with a HiPrep 26 desalting column
(GE Healthcare), a cation exchange column packed with SP Sepharose
(GE Healthcare), and a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare).
The purities were &gt;95% as determined by SDS–PAGE and Coomassie
staining.

Enzyme Kinetic Analysis of Wild-Type SHP2 and Its LS Mutants
Initial rate measurements for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) were conducted
at 25 °C in a pH 7.0 assay buffer (50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl). The assays were performed in
96-well plates in a total reaction volume of 200 μL. Substrate
concentrations ranging from 0.2Km to 5Km were used to determine kcat and Km. Reactions were started
by the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme to a 100 μL pNPP solution. The reactions were quenched with 50 μL
of 5 M sodium hydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was detected
using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular
Devices). The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by fitting
the data to the Michaelis–Menten equation in SigmaPlot.

To determine the kcat/Km for pTyr-containing peptide substrates, the reaction
(0.5 mL) was conducted in a 1 mL quartz cuvette at 25 °C in pH
7.0 assay buffer (50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA,
and 150 mM NaCl). The reaction rate was monitored by the increase
in fluorescence of the dephosphorylated peptide product at 305 nm
with excitation at 280 nm on a PerkinElmer model LS50B luminescence
spectrometer. The reaction was performed
at a substrate concentration much lower than its Km, and the enzyme concentration was at least 10 times
lower than the substrate concentration. Under this condition, the
Michaelis–Menten equation reduces to the equation v = (kcat/Km)[E][S]. The reaction is first-order with respect to [S], and the
observed apparent first-order rate constant is equal to (kcat/Km)[E], which can be determined
by fitting the reaction time course data to a first-order rate equation
in SigmaPlot. The kcat/Km value is calculated from the first-order rate constant
divided by a given enzyme concentration.

Assay of the Inhibition
of the SHP2 PTP Domain by the N-SH2
Domain
PTP activity was assayed using pNPP
as a substrate at 25 °C in pH 7.0 assay buffer (50 mM 3,3-dimethylglutarate,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 150 mM NaCl). The assays were performed in
96-well plates in a total reaction volume of 200 μL. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of enzyme (wild-type SHP2 or the LS
SHP2 mutant catalytic domain) to a reaction mixture containing pNPP and the isolated SHP2 N-SH2 domain. For the determination
of Ki, the pNPP concentration
was varied at three different concentrations of the N-SH2 domain.
The reaction rate was measured using a SpectraMax Plus 384 microplate
spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). The Ki values were determined by fitting the data using the EnzymeKinetics
module in SigmaPlot.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure
Determination
All crystals were grown at 20 °C in hanging
drops containing
1.5 μL of a protein solution with 1.5 μL of a reservoir
solution. Proteins were dissolved in a pH 7.8 Tris buffer containing
20 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. The reservoir
solution and protein concentration were optimized to yield high-quality
crystals for different LS SHP2 mutants, for example, 18% PEG3350 and
300 mM KF for A461T (10 mg/mL), 20% PEG3350 and 300 mM LiCl for G464A
(8 mg/mL), 20% PEG3350 and 300 mM KCOOH for T468M (8 mg/mL), 20% PEG3350
and 200 mM KF for Q506P (8 mg/mL), and 18% PEG3350 and 200 mM KF for
Q510E (10 mg/mL). The crystals were transferred into the cryoprotectant
buffer, containing the same components in the reservoir solution except
with an increased concentration of PEG3350 (30%), and were flash-frozen
with liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline 19-BM (for T468M
and A461T) or 19-ID (for G464A, Q506P, and Q510E) at the Advanced
Photon Source (APS) and were processed with HKL3000. The structures were determined by molecular replacement
with Molrep using the coordinates of
our previously reported SHP2 wild-type structure [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) entry 4DGP] as a search model. The structural
refinements were conducted iteratively using the phenix.refine program
in the PHENIX software suite.

Hydrogen/Deuterium
Exchange Mass Spectrometry
Stock
solutions of wild-type SHP2 and its mutants (residues 1–528)
were prepared in a 1H2O-based buffer (pH 7.8).
Deuterium exchange was initiated by 20-fold dilution of each enzyme
in a similar deuterium 2H2O buffer (pD 7.8).
At set deuterium exchange time points (10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 10 min,
30 min, and 60 min), the reaction was quenched by the addition of
a cold 1H2O-based 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 2.3) at equal volume. For peptide-based mass spectrometry analysis,
the quench solution contained pepsin endoproteinase (Sigma) that would
make a pepsin:SHP2 ratio of 1.5:1 (w:w) during digestion. The quenched
sample was digested on ice for 4 min and then loaded via an autosampler
onto an XBridge C18 2.5 μm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm (Waters) column
that was submerged in ice. A Surveyor MS pump (Finnigan) was used
to generate the chromatographic gradients. Peptides were separated
over time using a steep gradient of acetonitrile (10 to 35% over 7.5
min) and electrosprayed into an LTQ mass spectrometer (Finnigan).
Sequest (Thermo) was used to identify SHP2 peptic peptides. Peptides
were accepted for analysis on the basis of XCorr value significance
and identification in multiple sample runs. All peptide-based samples
were manually prepared and run in triplicate with a general standard
deviation of &lt;0.2 Da per time point. Unbiased peptide precursor
ion peak envelope centroiding was performed using HX-express. Significant deuterium exchange differences in
SHP2 mutants relative to WT were mapped onto the SHP2 sequence and
crystal structure in a heat map format.

Cell Culture, Immunoblotting,
and Immunoprecipitation
HEK293 cells were cultured at 37
°C and 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). The WT or SHP2 mutant (E76K,
Y279C, A461T, G464A, T468M, R498L, Q506P, Q510E, C459S, and Y279C/C459S)
cloned in mammalian expression vector pCN-HA, a modified version of
pcDNA3.1 that generated proteins with an N-terminal HA tag, was transfected
into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four hours post-transfection,
cells were serum-starved overnight and then either left unstimulated
or stimulated with EGF (5 or 50 ng/mL) or 10 ng/mL HGF for various
periods of time (0, 30, and 60 min). All growth factors were obtained
from Sigma. For immunoblotting, the cell lysates were electrophoresed
on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and the separated proteins were transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell
Signaling), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), anti-Phospho-Paxillin (Tyr118)
(Cell Signaling), anti-Paxilin (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-HA
(Santa Cruz), and anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz) antibodies followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The blots
were developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique using the
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation,
the cells were lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mM NaF, and
1 mM NaVO4] supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor
tablet (Roche). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15000
rpm for 20 min. The lysate protein concentration was estimated using
a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Three micrograms of HA antibody
(Santa Cruz) was added to 1 mg of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C
for 3 h with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). After being washed
three times with lysis buffer, the protein complex was boiled with
Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotting.
Representative results from at least two independent experiments are
shown.

Results
LS-Associated SHP2 Mutants
Exhibit Reduced Catalytic Activity
On the basis of their
locations in the PTP domain, it has been
suggested that LS SHP2 mutations may harm SHP2 phosphatase activity.
Previous studies were limited to immunoprecipitated enzymes and/or
substrates, and activity measurements were conducted at a single substrate
concentration. We set out to determine the kinetic parameters for
wild-type SHP2 and LS SHP2 mutant-catalyzed reactions using both a
small molecule chromogenic substrate pNPP and pTyr-containing
peptides as substrates. To conduct rigorous kinetic measurements,
we expressed and purified the recombinant SHP2 catalytic domain (CD,
residues 224–528) and full-length construct lacking the C-terminal
tail (FL, residues 1–528) for the wild type and seven LS mutants
(Y279C, A461T, G464A, T468M, R498L, Q506P, and Q510E). Previous studies
have shown that truncation of the C-terminus does not affect the autoinhibition
mechanism. Kinetic parameters for the
enzyme-catalyzed reaction were determined at pH 7.0 and 25 °C.
Because pNPP is a small aryl phosphate that mimics
pTyr, its hydrolysis is sensitive only to structural perturbations
to the active site. Thus, results with pNPP will
reveal the effects of LS SHP2 mutations on the intrinsic phosphatase
activity of SHP2. As shown in Table , the kcat of full-length SHP2 is only 2% of that of
the catalytic domain, which is consistent with the structural finding
that full-length SHP2 is in an autoinhibited, closed conformation., The phosphatase activities of the LS SHP2 mutant catalytic domains
are lower than those of the wild-type SHP2 counterpart, ranging from
10-fold (Q506P) to 930-fold (A461T). Interestingly, with the exception
of R498L, the kcat values of the full-length
LS SHP2 mutants are still 2–26-fold lower than those of their
corresponding catalytic domains. These results suggest that, similar
to wild-type SHP2, these full-length LS SHP2 mutants also exist in
a closed, autoinhibited conformation. Because the full-length and
catalytic domain constructs of R498L exhibit similar activity, R498L
may already exist in the open conformation.

To further investigate the
effect of LS SHP2 mutations on SHP2
activity, we also utilized more physiologically relevant substrates,
i.e., pTyr-containing peptides derived from putative SHP2 substrate
proteins, including EGFR/pY992 (DADEpY992LIPQQG), Sprouty1/pY53 (GSNEpY53TEGPS), Paxillin/pY118 (EEHVpY118SFPN), and Gab1/pY589 (DSEENpY589VPMNPNL). These pTyr-containing peptides are supposed
to preferentially bind with the catalytic site as substrates, but
to minimize potential competition because of binding of the pTyr peptide
to the N-SH2 domain, we determined the kcat/Km value, a measure of substrate specificity,
under conditions where substrate concentrations were much lower than Km. The SHP2-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the
pTyr peptides was monitored by the increase in tyrosine fluorescence
at pH 7.0 and 25 °C, and kcat/Km was directly calculated from the reaction
progress curve. Table  lists the kcat/Km values for two of the most recurrent LS SHP2 mutants,
Y279C and T468M. Similar to results obtained with pNPP, the ability of the LS SHP2 mutants to catalyze the hydrolysis
of pTyr-containing peptides is significantly compromised. Also, the
full-length wild-type and LS SHP2 mutant presumably exist in the autoinhibited
state because their kcat/Km values are considerably lower than those of their corresponding
catalytic domains. Finally, the relative preference for the peptide
substrates exhibited by the LS SHP2 mutants is similar to that of
the wild-type enzyme, indicating that LS SHP2 mutations do not alter
SHP2 substrate specificity.

LS SHP2 Mutants Exist in the Closed Conformation,
but with Weakened
Intramolecular N-SH2–PTP Interdomain Interaction
Given
the diverse nature of LS SHP2 mutations, we believe that it is important
to obtain three-dimensional structures for all LS SHP2 mutants to
fully understand the molecular underpinnings responsible for the disease.
Following our previous structural analysis of wild-type SHP2 and LS
SHP2 mutant Y279C, we proceeded to determine
the crystal structures of the six other LS SHP2 mutants (A461T, G464A,
T468M, R498L, Q506P, and Q510E). Similar to earlier studies, the SHP2
constructs (residues 1–528) encompass the two tandem SH2 domains
and the PTP domain. We acquired crystals for all LS SHP2 mutants and
obtained diffraction data for A461T, G464A, T468M, Q506P, and Q510E,
but not R498L. The data collection and structural refinement statistics
for the five LS SHP2 mutants are summarized in Table . Except for T468M, which crystallized in the P21 space group with two molecules per asymmetric unit,
the other four mutants crystallized in the P21212 space group with one molecule per asymmetric
unit, similar to wild-type SHP2 and the Y279C LS SHP2 mutant.

To gain structural
insight into LS SHP2 mutations, we superimposed
the structure of each mutant onto that of wild-type SHP2 (Figure ) and calculated the root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) of Cα atoms (mutant vs wild type) for the full-length
protein, individual domain, or selected loops in SHP2 (Table ). As already reported,, wild-type SHP2 is in a closed conformation (Figure A): the D′E-loop in the N-SH2 domain penetrates into
the active site pocket walled by five loops (known as the P-loop,
pY-loop, WPD-loop, Q-loop, and E-loop) in the PTP domain, physically
occluding the active site. In agreement with the prediction from our
kinetic experiments, LS SHP2 mutants Y279C, A461T, G464A, T468M, Q506P,
and Q510E are indeed found in an autoinhibited, closed conformation.
The rmsds for the full-length structures range from 0.418 to 1.332
Å among all six mutants, indicating that the overall structures
of the LS SHP2 mutants are similar to that of the wild-type enzyme
(Figure B,C). Interestingly, LS SHP2 mutations
in the P-loop induce the largest structural perturbations, especially
among residues in the E-loop (Figure B), as
evidenced by the relatively higher rmsd values for A461T and G464A
(∼1.3 Å). Fairly small rmsd values were observed for the
other four mutants (Y279C, T468M, Q506P, and Q510E), suggesting that
these mutations cause no obvious structural alterations in the overall
structures (Figure C).

Although
Y279C, A461T, G464A, T468M, Q506P, and Q510E are still
in the closed conformation, closer comparison of the mutant and wild-type
structures reveals that these mutations destabilize the intramolecular
N-SH2–PTP interdomain interaction. The Y279C mutation (Figure A) abrogates the interaction between the phenol
group and the side chains of D61 and Y62 in the D′E-loop. The
loss of the phenol also eliminates its van der Waals and polar interactions
with K364 and K366, shifting the terminal amino group of K364 away
from the D′E-loop, which sequentially displaces the guanidinium
of R362 and the imidazole ring of H426 from the D′E-loop. The
end result for Y279C is weakened van der Waals and polar interactions
between the D′E-loop in the N-SH2 domain and the pY-loop, WPD-loop,
and E-loop in the PTP domain. The A461T mutation (Figure B) introduces steric repulsion with Y62 in the D′E-loop
and Y279 in the pY-loop and pushes both residues away from the active
site. Displacement of Y279 triggers repositioning of the R278 side
chain, disrupting the R278-bridged H-bond network (i.e., R278 with
the side chain of S365 and backbone oxygens of K366, G332, and C333)
that functions to restrain the E-loop for a well-defined active pocket
in wild-type SHP2. As a result, the E-loop in A461T moves away from
the active site, losing its interaction with the D′E-loop in
the N-SH2 domain. The G464A mutation (Figure C) creates a strong steric clash with the backbone oxygen of G60,
which triggers local conformational changes in G60 and the adjacent
T59. These conformational changes drive the D′E-loop ∼1
Å from the active site and weaken van der Waals and polar interactions
between T59 and R362, abolishing the interaction of the E-loop with
the D′E-loop. The T468M mutation (Figure D) causes steric repulsion with W423 in the WPD-loop, pushing the
WPD-loop and nearby E-loop slightly away from the D′E-loop
and therefore weakening the N-SH2–PTP interdomain interaction.
In the Q506P mutant (Figure E), the loss of
the glutamine side chain weakens van der Waals interaction with nearby
D′E-loop residues. More importantly, the Q506P mutation eliminates
two interdomain H-bonds formed by Q506 with the side chain of N58
and main chain of A72, thus weakening the N-SH2–PTP interdomain
interaction. The Q510E mutation (Figure F)
does not induce any noticeable structural changes, but unlike the
amide group in glutamine, the carboxylate side chain in a glutamic
acid cannot form a hydrogen bond with the backbone oxygen of G60 in
the D′E-loop, leading to a weakening of the N-SH2–PTP
interdomain interaction. Collectively, these structural observations
provide direct evidence that the N-SH2–PTP interdomain interaction
is destabilized in LS-associated SHP2 mutants. Consequently, LS SHP2
mutants may have an inherently stronger tendency, compared to that
of the wild-type enzyme, to undergo the transition from a closed,
autoinhibited conformation to an open, activated state.

gray and the specific LS mutant green. The mutation site is colored

in the mutant are denoted with yellow dashed lines.

Molecular Basis for the Catalytic Impairment
of the LS-Associated
SHP2 Mutants
In addition to revealing an altered “molecular
switch” mechanism for the LS-associated SHP2 mutants, the availability
of the mutant structures also provides an opportunity to examine the
molecular basis for the impaired phosphatase activity associated with
the LS SHP2 mutants. The PTP-catalyzed reaction proceeds via a two-step
mechanism involving a covalent intermediate. Following substrate binding, nucleophilic attack by the active site
cysteine (C459 in SHP2) occurs on the substrate phosphorus atom in
the first catalytic step, leading to the formation of a thiophosphoryl
enzyme intermediate (E-P)., E-P formation is assisted
by a conserved aspartic acid (D425 in SHP2) in the WPD-loop, functioning
as a general acid, to neutralize the buildup of a negative charge
on the leaving group., In the second catalytic step,
E-P hydrolysis by a water molecule is assisted by D425, which functions
as a general base, with subsequent release of the free enzyme and
inorganic phosphate., In addition, the two conserved
glutamine residues (Q506 and Q510 in SHP2) in the Q-loop are important
for the precise placement of the water nucleophile for efficient E-P
hydrolysis., The PTPs further accelerate E-P
formation and hydrolysis by preferentially binding the pentacoordinated
transition states with the guanidinium side chain of the active site
arginine (R465 in SHP2) and the main chain amides of the P-loop residues
(C459SAGIGR465).−

Y279 in the pY-loop is
involved in π–π stacking interaction with the benzene
ring of pTyr and sets the depth of the PTP active site pocket. Our previous Y279C structure shows how this
mutation alters the molecular surface of the active site, thereby
weakening substrate binding and impairing catalysis. Similarly, the current crystal structures also uncover
the molecular basis of the impaired activity for other LS SHP2 mutants.
Q506 and Q510 are invariant among the PTPs and are located in a surface
loop (Q-loop) near the active site. Q506P and Q510E mutations do not
alter the shape of the active site pocket but appear to decrease the
positive electrostatic potential within the active site (Figure A). Previous structural and mutagenesis analyses
of the cognate glutamine residues in Yersinia PTP
and PTP1B have shown that Q506 is important for the optimal positioning
of the nucleophilic water in the hydrolysis of the E-P intermediate,
while Q510 plays an important role for both E-P formation and breakdown
through a water-mediated hydrogen bonding network with the phosphoryl
moiety.,, Indeed, structural
superimposition of PTP1B·VO4 (PDB entry 3I8O), which mimics the transition state for E-P hydrolysis, and
SHP2/Q506P onto the wide-type SHP2 structure revealed that the Q506P
mutation disrupts the hydrogen bond between the side chain of Q506
and the apical oxygen in vanadate, which is equivalent to the oxygen
atom of the attacking nucleophilic water in the E-P hydrolysis step
(Figure B). Similar structural comparison
of PTP1B·EGFR/pY992-peptide·VO4 (PDB entry 3I7Z), which mimics the transition state of E-P formation, or
PTP1B·VO4 with SHP2/Q510E showed that the Q510E mutation
abrogates a hydrogen bond with a conserved structural water, which
interacts with the apical oxygen and one of the equatorial oxygens
in the oxyanion (Figure C). Thus, the Q510E
mutant destabilizes the transition states for both of the chemical
steps.

(indicated by purple dashed lines with distances labeled). The black

and the blue labels for PTP1B. The yellow dashed lines represent the
well-defined H-bond network in the transition state. The representation

onto that of wild-type SHP2 (PDB entry 4DGP, gray) to illustrate the abrogated hydrogen
bonds (indicated by purple dashed lines with distances labeled). (D)
The A461T mutation introduces strong steric repulsions with the bound

structures of PTP1B·EGFR(Y992)-peptide·VO4 (PDB

wild-type SHP2 (PDB entry 4DGP, gray) to illustrate the steric repulsions (highlighted

introduces strong steric repulsion with Q506 and structurally conserved

entry 4OHE,

the steric repulsion (highlighted by red dashed lines with distances
labeled). (F) The T468M mutation introduces strong steric repulsion
with W423 within the closed WPD-loop. The complex structures of PTP1B·EGFR(Y992)-peptide·VO4 (PDB entry 3I7Z, cyan) and the SHP2 T468M mutant (PDB entry 4OHL, green) were superimposed
onto that of wild-type SHP2 (PDB entry 4DGP, gray) to illustrate the steric repulsion
(highlighted by red dashed lines with distances labeled).

A461 and G464 reside within the “signature
motif” CXAGXGR that defines the PTP
family and comprises
the P-loop in PTP structures. As shown in Figure A, the active site pocket in A461T or G464A is significantly
altered, being much broader and less electropositive especially around
the catalytic C459 because of the displacement of the E-loop. Thus,
A461T or G464A may not be able to bind and precisely position pTyr
for efficient catalysis. To improve our understanding of the impact
of these P-loop mutations on SHP2 catalysis, we superimposed the structures
of PTP1B·EGFR/pY992-peptide·VO4 and SHP2/A461T
onto the SHP2 wild-type structure. As shown in Figure D, substitution of A461 with a Thr imposes a strong steric
clash (highlighted by red dashed lines with distances labeled in red)
with the bound pTyr and destabilizes the transition state for E-P
formation, therefore impairing the activity of the A461T mutant. Superimposition
of the structures of PTP1B·VO4 and SHP2/G464A onto
the SHP2 wild-type structure revealed why G464A has a lower phosphatase
activity. Unlike the situation in the wild-type SHP2 structure, Q506
(Q262 in PTP1B) in SHP2/G464A is unable to make the necessary conformational
change to be in position to coordinate water-mediated E-P hydrolysis
(Figure E), because of an unfavorable obstruction
by the substituted Ala at residue 464. As shown in Figure A, the T468M mutation introduces steric repulsion
with W423, which drives the WPD-loop ∼2 Å from active
site and creates a slightly broader active site pocket. More importantly,
structural superimposition of PTP1B·EGFR/pY992-peptide·VO4 and SHP2/T468M onto the wild-type SHP2 structure showed that
substitution of T468 with Met leads to strong steric hindrance with
W423 (W179 in PTP1B) within the closed WPD-loop, which would prevent
WPD-loop closure and efficient general acid/base catalysis by D425.
Taken together, our structural analyses illuminate the molecular basis
for the reduced catalytic activity that is characteristic of the LS-associated
SHP2 mutants. Although further experimentation will be required to
substantiate these conclusions, catalytic impairments induced by the
LS mutations appear to range from weakened substrate binding to misalignment
of active site residues and weakened transition-state stabilization
(Figure ).

LS-associated SHP2 mutations
on the SHP2-catalyzed reaction.

The LS-Associated SHP2 Mutants Have an Increased Propensity
To Adopt the Open Conformation
Our structural studies described
above indicate that although LS-associated SHP2 mutants are in the
closed conformation, the N-SH2–PTP interdomain interaction
is significantly compromised in the mutants. To furnish additional
evidence that this interdomain interaction is weakened in the LS SHP2
mutants, we measured the ability of the isolated N-SH2 domain to inhibit
the phosphatase activity of the wild-type and LS SHP2 mutant catalytic
domains. We previously established that the N-SH2 domain competitively
inhibits SHP2 PTP domain-catalyzed pNPP hydrolysis. The competitive nature is in line with the structural
observation that the N-SH2 domain interacts with the PTP domain, thus
blocking access of the substrate to the active site. Our prediction
was that the dissociation constants (Ki values) for the N-SH2 domain and the LS SHP2 mutant PTP domain binary
complexes would be larger than that for the binding of N-SH2 to the
wild-type catalytic domain. As a control, the N-SH2 domain bearing
the GOF E76K mutation displayed no inhibitory activity against the
SHP2 PTP domain even at 200 μM N-SH2/E76K, which is consistent
with the expectation that the full-length E76K mutant is in a constitutive
active and open conformation. With the exception of A461T, which had
an extremely low activity that prevented accurate measurement of the
inhibition constant, the Ki values for
the N-SH2 domain-mediated inhibition of LS SHP2 mutant PTP domains
were determined and are summarized in Table . In support of the prediction from the steady-state kinetic data
(Table ) that R498L may already exist in the
open conformation, the N-SH2 domain failed to inhibit the R498L PTP
reaction at a concentration of 200 μM. Moreover, the results
indicate the LS SHP2 mutant PTP domains were less inhibited by the
N-SH2 domain as evidenced by the 1.5–98-fold increase in the Ki values compared to that of the wild-type enzyme
(Table ). Collectively, the inhibition data
confirm the structural observations that revealed that the interdomain
interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains is weakened in the LS-asociated
SHP2 mutants.

On the basis of the results from our structural and kinetic studies,
it appears that, relative to wild-type SHP2, the LS SHP2 mutants have
a stronger propensity to undergo the transition from a closed, autoinhibited
conformation to an open, activated form. To gather more direct evidence
of the increased “openness” for the LS mutants, we investigated
the overall solution dynamic properties of wild-type SHP2, GOF mutant
E76K, and all seven LS SHP2 mutants using hydrogen/deuterium exchange
mass spectrometry (H/DX-MS). The H/DX-MS technique allows analysis
of protein conformational dynamics in solution by measuring the exchange
of backbone amide hydrogens with the deuterium bulk solvent., We identified 38 peptides for each protein, covering 92% of the
SHP2 sequence (residues 1–528). We determined backbone amide
H/D exchange for each protein, calculated the differences in deuterium
uptake between the mutant and wild-type SHP2 for each peptide at each
time point, and generated both two-dimensional and three-dimensional
“heat maps” showing the differential H/D exchange experienced
by the mutants and the wild-type enzyme (Figure ).

LS SHP2 mutants have conformational dynamics and propensities for
the open conformation higher than those of the wild type. (A) Two-dimensional
conformational dynamics heat map, characterized by differences in
deuterium uptake between mutant and wild-type SHP2 on 38 peptides
at various time points (0.2, 0.5, 1, 10, 30, and 60 min). (B) Differential
hydrogen/deuterium exchange experienced by the LS and E76K SHP2 mutants,
relative to the wild-type enzyme. Differential exchange data at the
10 min time point are mapped on the wild-type SHP2 crystal structure
(PDB entry 4DGP). Peptides in SHP2 mutants are color-coded on the basis of an increased
or decreased level of exchange relative to that of the wild type as
described for panel A.

The GOF E76K mutant was used as a reference for H/D exchange
magnitude
and location experienced in a “true” SHP2 open conformation.
Figure  shows that in comparison with wild-type
SHP2, a number of peptides in E76K, located in the interface between
the N-SH2 and PTP domains, display significant increases in their
levels of deuterium incorporation. Within the N-SH2 domain, these
peptides reside in the D′E-loop and adjacent β-strands
B–D, D′, E, and F, structural elements known to participate
in binding the PTP domain. Within the PTP domain, these peptides represent
the catalytic loops at the active site, including the P-loop, pY-loop,
E-loop, and Q-loop. Given the lack of inhibition of the PTP domain
by N-SH2/E76K, the observed increase in the level of deuterium uptake
surrounding the N-SH2 and PTP binding site suggests that the interdomain
binding interface is solvent-exposed, providing direct evidence that
E76K exists in an open and active conformation. Notably, LS mutant
R498L exhibits an H/D exchange profile very similar to that of the
E76K mutant (Figure ), indicating that like
E76K, R498L is also in the open conformation. H/D exchange data show
that the six other LS-associated SHP2 mutants also experience increased
deuterium uptake in the interface between the N-SH2 and PTP domains,
albeit to a lesser degree in comparison with the peptides observed
in E76K. The overall extents of H/D exchange decrease in the following
order: R498L &gt; Q510E ≈ Q506P &gt; G464A &gt; Y279C &gt;
A461T ≈
T468M [generally in accordance with the degree by which the catalytic
domain is inhibited by the N-SH2 domain (Table ), suggesting that the weakened N-SH2–PTP interaction in LS
SHP2 mutants may be responsible for the increased dynamics in the
N-SH2–PTP interdomain interface]. The increased deuterium uptake
in the N-SH2–PTP interface in LS SHP2 mutants indicates that
this interface is more dynamic and solvent-exposed, which supports
the notion that LS SHP2 mutants may have an inherently stronger tendency,
compared to the wild-type enzyme, to undergo the transition from a
closed, autoinhibited conformation to an open, activated state.

LS-Associated SHP2 Mutations Engender GOF Phenotypes
Results
from our kinetic, structural, and biophysical experiments
suggest that LS mutations destabilize the closed SHP2 conformation
and increase the propensity of the mutants to adopt the open conformation.
It has been suggested that there is negative cooperativity between
N-SH2 domain’s intramolecular binding with the PTP domain and
its intermolecular association with a pTyr-containing scaffolding
protein. Thus, engagement of the N-SH2
domain to a specific pTyr peptide will weaken its autoinhibitory interaction
with the PTP domain, whereas a weakened intramolecular N-SH2–PTP
interaction may enhance binding of N-SH2 with its pTyr-containing
partners. Given the observed decrease in the strength of the N-SH2–PTP
interaction, LS SHP2 mutants are expected to show increased affinity
for adapter proteins. A major SHP2 binding partner is Grb2-associated
binder-1 (Gab1), which becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated
upon growth factor stimulation. Through its N-SH2 domain binding to
the pTyr sequence motif in Gab1, SHP2 is directed to its physiological
substrate(s) to drive RAS-ERK1/2 pathway activation., To demonstrate that the LS SHP2 mutants indeed display enhanced
binding affinity for Gab1, we investigated the effects of wild-type
SHP2, GOF E76K, and all seven LS SHP2 mutants on epidermal growth
factor (EGF) signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells
as previously described.,, Consistent with the prediction that the N-SH2 domain of LS SHP2
mutants has a higher affinity for pTyr ligands, the LS SHP2 mutants
as well as the GOF E76K mutant, which is known to favor the open conformation,
more readily formed complexes with Gab1 upon EGF stimulation (Figure A). Overall, the relative affinity for Gab1 displayed
by the LS SHP2 mutants tracks well with the extent of H/D exchange
experienced in the N-SH2–PTP interface (Figure ), which is a measure of the openness for SHP2. Importantly,
the enhanced Gab1 binding exhibited by the LS SHP2 mutants persisted
up to 60 min after EGF stimulation, when no association was notable
between wild-type SHP2 and Gab1. Thus, the LS SHP2 mutants can preferentially
bind the upstream adaptor Gab1 (compared to wild-type SHP2) and stay
longer on the scaffolding protein. We speculated that the increased
residence time on Gab1 could prolong substrate turnover by the LS
SHP2 mutants, which could compensate for their reduced phosphatase
activity. To this end, we assessed the ability of wild-type and mutant
SHP2 enzymes to dephosphorylate Paxillin/pY118, a physiological substrate
of SHP2 required for EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Figure B shows that,
like the GOF E76K mutant, the LS SHP2 mutants were more efficient
in dephosphorylating Paxillin/pY118.

LS SHP2 mutations engender GOF effects
on the RAS-ERK1/2 signaling
pathway. (A) LS SHP2 mutants preferentially associate with and stay
longer with Gab1 under EGF stimulation. (B) LS SHP2 mutants dephosphorylate
the physiological substrate paxillin more efficiently. (C) LS SHP2
mutations enhance EGF-induced ERK1/2 activation. (D) LS SHP2 mutants
preferentially associate with and stay longer with Gab1 under HGF
stimulation. (E) LS SHP2 mutations enhance HGF-induced ERK1/2 activation.
All results shown in this figure were representative of two to four
independent experiments; the numbers below each panel are means ±
the standard deviation, and the statistical significance is indicated
(*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01). Quantification
and normalization were performed as follows. Band intensity was quantified
using ImageJ, and the Gab1/HA-SHP2 (for panels A and D), pPaxillin(pY118)/total
Paxillin (for panel B), and pERK1/2/total ERK1/2 (for panels C and
E) ratios were normalized to the ratio in wild-type SHP2-overexpressing
cells.

SHP2/Gab1 binding and SHP2-mediated
dephosphorylation of Paxillin/pY118
are two recognized signaling events shown to be important for EGF-induced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation., Given the higher affinity
for Gab1 and increased level of Paxillin/pY118 dephosphorylation by
the LS SHP2 mutants, LS SHP2 mutations are expected to engender a
GOF effect on ERK1/2 activation. To determine whether LS SHP2 mutants
are capable of activating the ERK1/2 pathway, we measured EGF-induced
ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type and
mutant SHP2 (Figure C). Compared to that of
wild-type SHP2-expressing cells, the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation
was further elevated and sustained in cells expressing the GOF E76K
mutant as well as the LS SHP2 mutants. To make sure that the observed
GOF effects exhibited by the LS mutants were not unique to EGF signaling,
we also examined hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced SHP2–Gab1
binding and subsequent ERK1/2 activation in cells overexpressing wild-type
and mutant SHP2. Similar to EGF signaling, the SHP2–Gab1 interaction
is also essential for HGF-mediated ERK1/2 activation downstream of
the Met receptor., Not surprisingly, the GOF E76K
mutant and all LS SHP2 mutants exhibit enhanced Gab1 binding (Figure D) and ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells, especially
at the later time point of 60 min following HGF stimulation (Figure E). Finally, to address the issue of whether the
residual phosphatase activity associated with the LS SHP2 mutants
is required for the GOF phenotype, we generated a double mutant in
which the phosphatase activity of the Y279C mutant is eliminated by
replacing the catalytic Cys459 with Ser and examined its effect on
Gab1 binding and ERK1/2 activation upon either EGF or HGF stimulation.
As shown in Figure , although the catalytically
dead double mutant Y279C/C459S still showed preferred and sustained
binding with Gab1, it was unable to activate ERK1/2, indicating that
the residual phosphatase activity associated with the LS SHP2 mutant
is required for enhanced ERK1/2 activation. As a control, the C459S
mutant was also unable to support growth factor-stimulated ERK1/2
activation. Collectively, the results show that LS SHP2 mutations
engender GOF phenotypes and enhanced signaling through the ERK1/2
pathway is a general feature for all LS SHP2 mutants.

Residual phosphatase
activity of LS SHP2 mutants is required for
ERK1/2 activation. The catalytically dead Y279C/C459S double mutant
was unable to activate ERK1/2 activation upon either EGF (A) or HGF
(B) stimulation. The results shown in this figure are representative
of two independent experiments; the numbers below each panel are means
± the standard deviation, and the statistical significance is
indicated (*P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt;

those described in the legend of Figure .

Discussion
SHP2
is an allosteric enzyme regulated by an intramolecular switch
between its N-SH2 and PTP domains. Unlike most other PTPs that terminate
the action of PTKs, SHP2 promotes growth factor-mediated RAS-ERK1/2
activation.− Germline mutations in SHP2 are known to cause 90
and 50% of LS and NS cases, respectively, two of several autosomal-dominant conditions collectively classified
as “RASopathies”, which are characterized by GOF mutations
in components of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway. NS-associated SHP2 mutations cluster within the interface between
the N-SH2 and PTP domains, which confer GOF properties to SHP2, presumably
by alleviating the autoinhibitory effect of the N-SH2 domain upon
the PTP active site.,− Thus, NS-associated SHP2 mutants
display increased phosphatase activity and promote sustained activation
of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway.,, Similarly, GOF mutations in other components of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway,
such as RAS, RAF, and SOS1, have been identified in NS patients lacking
SHP2 mutations.− Moreover, GOF mutations in RAS, RAF, or MEK1/2 also cause phenotypically
overlapping Costelo and Cardiofaciocutaneous syndromes.− These observations underscore the fact that aberrant activation
of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway plays a key role in developing RASopathies.

In contrast to NS-associated SHP2 mutations,
LS-associated SHP2
mutations alter seven residues in the active site of the PTP domain,
yielding mutant enzymes with reduced phosphatase activity.,,,− Because of the impaired catalytic activity, LS-associated
SHP2 mutants were initially suggested to be LOF variants. However, from a genetic perspective, it is worth
noting that the LS-associated SHP2 alleles are specific missense mutations.
If their sole effect in transducing their phenotype was to reduce
or eliminate SHP2’s phosphatase activity, the existence of
some haploinsufficient alleles such as nonsense mutations might be
anticipated, but none has been observed., One report suggested that LS-associated SHP2 mutants can act as
dominant negatives that inhibit growth factor-evoked ERK1/2 activation
in transfection assays. Zebrafish embryos
injected with mRNA encoding LS SHP2 mutations do not show ERK1/2 activation
in neural crest, and the Y279C knock-in
mouse model shows Akt hyperactivation, but not ERK1/2 hyperactivation,
in the heart. Other studies reveal that
ubiquitous expression of two of the most recurrent LS-causing SHP2
alleles (Y279C and T468M) in Drosophila leads to
GOF phenotypes that lead to heightened EGF-mediated RAS-ERK1/2 pathway
activation, which were similar to those
observed with NS-causing SHP2 mutant transgenic flies. Importantly, experiments with the Y279C/R465M
transgenic fly suggest that the LS SHP2 mutant’s residual phosphatase
activity was required for the GOF developmental effects. Our data with a catalytically dead double mutant
Y279C/C459S provide further evidence that the residual phosphatase
activity associated with the LS SHP2 mutant is required for enhanced
ERK1/2 activation (Figure ). Consistent with
findings in the Drosophila LS model, MEK1 and basal
ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were elevated in induced pluripotent
stem cells from LS patients. Importantly,
GOF mutations in RAF1 and BRAF are also found in LS patients, indicating that
like all RASopathies, enhanced RAS-ERK1/2 signaling is responsible
for the pathogenesis of LS, as well.

How do catalytically impaired
LS-associated SHP2 mutants engender
GOF phenotypes? To begin to answer this question, we took a multidisciplinary
approach, involving a combination of enzyme kinetics, site-directed
mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, H/D exchange mass spectrometry,
and cell biology to characterize the structural and biochemical properties
of LS-associated SHP2 mutants encompassing all seven known LS SHP2
mutation sites. Rigorous kinetic analyses with both pNPP- and pTyr-containing peptide substrates indicate that LS SHP2
mutations lead to significantly reduced SHP2 phosphatase activity.
Detailed comparison of the mutant crystal structures with those of
wild-type SHP2 and PTP1B in complex with a substrate and/or a transition-state
mimetic reveals that the observed catalytic impairments in the LS-associated
SHP2 mutants are caused by a number of mechanisms, including weakened
substrate binding, perturbation of active site residue alignment,
and weakened transition-state stabilization. Importantly, we found
that although the LS-associated SHP2 mutants still exist in the closed
autoinhibited conformation, the intramolecular N-SH2–PTP interdomain
interaction in the mutants is significantly weakened, leading to mutant
enzymes with an inherently higher propensity, compared to that of
the wild-type enzyme, to be activated by engagement of its N-SH2 domain
with pTyr motifs in growth factor receptors and scaffolding proteins
and to adopt an open, activated state. As a consequence, LS-associated
SHP2 mutants bind upstream activators (e.g., Gab1) preferentially
and stay longer with scaffolding adapters, thus prolonging specific
substrate turnover (e.g., Paxillin), which compensates for the reduced
phosphatase activity and engenders GOF phenotypes through sustained
activation of the RAS-ERK1/2 pathway. It should also be noted that
SHP2 is known to be tyrosine-phosphorylated on two C-terminal Tyr
residues (Tyr542 and Tyr580), which can apparently activate SHP2 by
intramolecular SH2 binding.− It is thus possible that an increased
level of interaction between the N-SH2 domain and the C-terminal tyrosine
phosphorylation sites may also contribute to LS SHP2 mutant-mediated
hyper-ERK1/2 activation. Overall, this study provides new insight
into the molecular basis of LS-associated SHP2 mutations as well as
the biochemical mechanism that underlies the pathological processes
mediated by the LS SHP2 mutants. Our results also serve as a useful
framework for studying other disease-associated SHP2 mutations that
may have an impact on future drug development targeting SHP2.
