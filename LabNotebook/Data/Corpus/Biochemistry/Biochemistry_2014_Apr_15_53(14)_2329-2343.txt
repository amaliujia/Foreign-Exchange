Heterotrimeric
G proteins play
essential roles in cellular communication by transducing extracellular
signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to a wide range of
downstream effectors. The fidelity of this process depends in part
upon the G protein itself, as it requires guanine nucleotide-binding
α subunits to exchange GDP for GTP and reversibly dissociate
from βγ dimers before each can interact with effectors. Originally, signaling was thought to be mediated
solely through Gα subunits; however,
Gβγ complexes are now widely recognized as independent
signaling molecules, with effectors such as adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase
C-β, PI 3-kinase, and components of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase cascade.− Additional effectors such as voltage-gated calcium and potassium
channels, as well as members of the exocytotic machinery, regulate
membrane voltage and neurotransmitter release.− With such diversity, it is hardly surprising that Gβγ
subunits make up a strongly expressed, structurally diverse family,
with 5 and 12 genes encoding 5 β and 12 γ protein subunits,
respectively., Historically, specificity has
largely been attributed to the α subunits as only modest functional
differences were observed in the ability of βγ isoform
combinations to regulate effectors in vitro., More recent evidence indicates this may not be the case in intact
cells, however, as studies have suggested very specific roles for
Gβ and Gγ isoforms.− However, while specific receptors and effectors may utilize unique
complements of G protein α, β, and γ subunits, we
have little understanding of which G protein heterotrimers exist in vivo, the factors controlling their distribution in tissues,
their subcellular expression, or their functional relevance in the
context of the whole organism. To this end, a greater understanding
of the tissue localization and subcellular distribution of Gβγ
isoforms will be of particular importance in determining which of
the many possible combinations are likely to occur physiologically,
what roles each may play in regulating signaling cascades, and their
impact in disease.

The majority of G protein β and γ
subunits have been
detected in the central nervous system (CNS).− Our understanding of their distributions largely stems from in situ hybridization studies; specifically, RNAs from some
β and γ isoforms exhibit wide distributions, while others
show expression more restricted to specific brain regions and cell
types, possibly reflecting unique functions.− Although a few studies have examined protein expression,,− efforts at this level have been less reliable as the high level
of sequence identity between isoforms has limited the development
of reliable subunit specific reagents. Proteomic analysis offers a powerful way to deepen our understanding
of the regional and subcellular localization patterns of Gβγ
isoforms as they can be undertaken using endogenous tissue without
the need for isoform specific antibodies. Studies examining synaptic
proteomes to date have largely focused on analyzing the global expression
of proteins involved in synaptic functions,− and no study has yet sought to specifically examine G protein localization
patterns. As a result, while a few β and γ isoforms have
been identified or even localized to subcellular fractions in discovery-based
experiments,− the majority have yet to be described. Such studies demonstrate
that even at isolated nerve endings, cells express large numbers of
proteins, making identification of all of the proteins in a sample
problematic. Further, highly abundant proteins may mask those expressed
at lower levels. To overcome these problems, we applied a targeted
proteomics approach known as multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM),, which allowed us to accurately identify unique G protein isoforms
in complex mixtures. Using this approach, we analyzed regional and
subcellular localization patterns of Gβ and Gγ isoforms
in different brain regions. Interestingly, we found that these subunits
exhibit distinct regional and subcellular localization patterns throughout
the CNS, suggesting roles for individual subunits in regulating specific
signaling pathways.

Materials and Methods
Protein Standards
Gβ1γ1 was purified from bovine
retina as described previously. Recombinant
Gβ1γ2 and Gβ5γ2 were expressed
in Sf9 cells and purified via a His6-tagged Gγ2 using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Human Gγ subunit cDNAs for Gγ4, Gγ5, Gγ7, Gγ11, and Gγ13 were subcloned by polymerase
chain reaction from pcDNA3.1+ clones (Missouri S&amp;T cDNA Resource
Center) into pGEX-6p-1 (GE Healthcare). The sequences of the resultant
vectors, hGgamma(x).pGEX-6p-1, were verified,
and GST fusion proteins were expressed in Rosetta Competent Cells
(EMD Millipore). After induction with 1 mM IPTG followed by a 4 h
incubation at 37 °C, the resultant Gγ proteins were batch
purified using Glutathione Sepahrose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and
eluted with 10 mM reduced free acid glutathione (Calbiochem).

Animals
Adult, male C57Bl6/J mice were decapitated,
and the cortex, cerebellum, neostriatum (termed the striatum), and
hippocampus were dissected, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80
°C until they were processed. To minimize post-mortem differences,
all brain regions were dissected at the same time and processed in
parallel. All animal protocols were conducted in accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the National Institutes of Health and were approved by the Vanderbilt
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Antibodies
The
following primary antibodies were used
for immunoblotting (dilutions indicated): rabbit anti-Gβ (Santa
Cruz, catalog no. sc-378, 1:15000), mouse anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-1 (NMDAR1) (BD Pharmingen, catalog no.
556308, 1:2000), mouse anti-postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) (Neuromab,
catalog no. 75-028, 1:20000), mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Millipore, catalog no. MAB374, 1:20000), and
mouse anti-syntaxin-1 (Santa Cruz, catalog no. sc-12736, 1:2000).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained
from Perkin-Elmer and used at the following dilutions: goat anti-rabbit
(1:20000) and goat anti-mouse (1:10000 for NMDAR1 and syntaxin and
1:20000 for PDS-95 and GAPDH).

Synaptosome Preparation
and Subcellular Fractionation
Subcellular fractions were
prepared as previously described. Briefly,
four whole mouse cortex (CTX), cerebellum
(CRB), striatum (Str), or hippocampus (Hippo) samples were pooled
and homogenized in 10 mL of a 0.32 M sucrose solution [0.32 M sucrose,
4.2 mM potassium 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonate (HEPES)
(pH 7.4), 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.54 μM
aprotinin, 10.7 μM leupeptin, 0.95 μM pepstatin, and 200
μM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)]. Homogenates were
centrifuged at 1000g and 4 °C for 10 min to
pellet nuclei and membrane debris before supernatants were transferred
to clean conical tubes. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of 0.32
M sucrose; the centrifugation step was repeated, and supernatants
were combined. Following mixing, supernatants were centrifuged at
10000g and 4 °C for 20 min to produce crude
synaptosome preparations. Supernatants were discarded and pellets
gently resuspended in 4 mL of hypotonic lysis buffer [20 mM Tris (pH
6.0), 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100,
1.54 μM aprotinin, 10.7 μM leupeptin, 0.95 μM pepstatin,
and 200 μM PMSF] before being incubated on ice for 20 min to
lyse membranes. Lysates were cleared via ultracentrifugation at 100000g and 4 °C for 2 h in a SW-55 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter)
and supernatants (consisting of the “perisynaptic/cytosolic”
fraction) transferred to clean conical tubes. Pellets were resuspended
in 1 mL of Tris buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1.54
μM aprotinin, 10.7 μM leupeptin, 0.95 μM pepstatin,
and 200 μM PMSF] and incubated on ice for 20 min. Lysates were
centrifuged at 10000g and 4 °C for 30 min and
supernatants containing enriched presynaptic fractions collected.
Finally, pellets were resuspended in 200 μL of a 1× phosphate-buffered
saline/1% SDS mixture and centrifuged at 10000g and
4 °C for 30 min. Supernatants containing enriched postsynaptic
fractions were collected. Protein concentrations were determined with
a BCA assay kit (Pierce).

Immunoblot Analysis
To examine the
enrichment of pre-
and postsynaptic fractions, Western blot analysis was performed; 7
μg of each fraction was diluted in 4× sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) sample buffer containing 100
mM dithiothreitol, heated for 5 min at 70 °C, and resolved on
10 or 15% SDS–PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically
to a nitrocellulose membrane in cold transfer buffer consisting of
200 mL of 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanonesulfonic acid (CAPS), 200
mL of methanol, and 1600 mL of water. Following transfer, membranes
were stained with Ponceau and cut between appropriate molecular weight
markers. Membranes were blocked with slight agitation for 1 h in a
buffer of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20
(Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes were then washed five times for 5 min in
TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 on a shaker before being incubated with the
appropriate primary antibodies in TBS with 5% milk and 0.2% Tween
20 on a shaker table at 4 °C overnight. The next day, membranes
underwent five 5 min washes on a shaker table in TBS with 0.1% Tween
20 before the appropriate secondary antibodies were diluted into TBS
with 5% milk and 0.2% Tween 20 followed by gentle agitation on a shaker
with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, membranes
were washed three times for 10 min in TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 followed
by two 15 min washes in TBS. Immunoblots were developed using Western
Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (NEL104) from Perkin-Elmer
as per their published protocols. Imaging was conducted using a Bio-Rad
imager.

Development and Validation of Targeted Mass Spectrometry Methods
Purified Gβγ isoforms or enriched protein pre- and
postsynaptic fractions were separated by SDS–PAGE (15% acrylamide)
and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen). Gel bands
corresponding to the molecular weights of Gβ and Gγ subunits
were excised, chopped into 1 mm3 pieces, reduced with dithiothreitol,
alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin. Individual
G protein subunit digests from purified proteins were analyzed via
nanoflow reverse phase liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS) on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific), while those from enriched protein synaptic fractions
were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
Peptides were loaded onto a capillary reverse phase analytical column
(360 μm outside diameter × 100 μm inside diameter)
using an Eksigent NanoLC high-performance liquid chromatography system
and autosampler. The analytical column was packed with 20 cm of C18
reverse phase material (Jupiter, 3 μm beads, 300 Å, Phenomenex),
equipped with a laser-pulled emitter tip. Peptides were gradient-eluted
at a flow rate of 500 nL/min, and the mobile phase solvents consisted
of 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid
and 99.9% acetonitrile (solvent B). A 45 min gradient was performed
for purified G protein samples, consisting of the following: from
0 to 10 min, 2% B (during sample loading); from 10 to 28 min, 2 to
40% B; from 28 to 34 min, 40 to 90% B; from 34 to 35 min, 90% B; from
35 to 37 min, 90 to 2% B; from 37 to 45 min, 2% B (column equilibration).
In comparison, a 90 min gradient was performed for G protein samples
isolated from enriched protein presynaptic fractions consisting of
the following: from 0 to 10 min, 2% B; from 10 to 50 min, 2 to 35%
B; from 50 to 60 min, 35 to 90% B; from 60 to 65 min, 90% B; from
65 to 70 min, 90 to 2% B; from 70 to 90 min, 2% B. Upon gradient elution,
peptides were mass analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL or LTQ Orbitrap
Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The instruments were
operated using a data-dependent method with dynamic exclusion enabled.
Full scan (m/z 300–2000)
spectra were acquired with the Orbitrap as the mass analyzer (resolution
of 60000), and the 5 most abundant (LTQ Orbitrap XL) or 16 most abundant
ions (LTQ Orbitrap Velos) in each MS scan were selected for fragmentation
via collision-induced dissociation (CID) in the LTQ. For selected
LC–MS/MS analyses, the LTQ Orbitrap Velos was operated using
a combination method of data-dependent and targeted scan events. Targets
were of specific m/z values corresponding
to unique Gβ or Gγ peptides selected from theoretical in silico digestions of the G protein subunits. Peptides
were identified via database searching with Sequest (Thermo Scientific). Tandem mass spectra were searched
against Bos taurus, Mus musculus, or Homo sapiens subsets of the UniprotKB protein
database (http://www.uniprot.org), and search results were
assembled using Scaffold version 3.0 (Proteome Software). Although
isoforms were purified from bovine retina, as well as cloned using
human sequences, peptides unique to each Gβγ isoform being
monitored were shown to be identical across all three species, allowing
use of these proteins for assay development. All searches were configured
to use variable modifications of carbamidomethylation on cysteine
and oxidation of methionine. The selected peptides from each G protein
β and γ subunit were validated via manual interrogation
of the raw tandem mass spectra using QualBrowser software (Xcalibur
version 2.1.0, Thermo Scientific), and as an additional validation
criterion, the observed monoisotopic m/z value was required to be within 5 ppm of the theoretical m/z value for a given peptide. Identified
peptides unique to G protein isoforms were selected, and their MS/MS
spectra were examined to select precursor–product ion transitions
for targeted MRM experiments. MRM methods were generated in Skyline before being exported and employed for G protein-targeted
experiments on a TSQ Vantage triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). Unscheduled MRM runs were performed on purified Gβγ
isoforms when available, as well as enriched pre- and postsynaptic
fractions from mouse cortex, to evaluate intensities of precursor
and product ions identified in early discovery proteomic runs. The
resulting MRM data were imported and analyzed in Skyline. Extracted
ion chromatographic peaks were manually interrogated and correct peaks
chosen on the basis of retention times, how well the relative distribution
of transition ions matched those from discovery experiments, and dot
plot values. Dot plot values were calculated by comparison of transition
ion intensities in MRM data relative to product ion intensities observed
in tandem mass spectra acquired in LTQ-Orbitrap discovery experiments.
Following validation, precursor and product ion lists were refined
to include only the optimal precursor and transitions necessary to
accurately identify each G protein isoform. Refined methods were required
to include at least two distinct peptides for each G protein isoform,
as well as three transitions for each peptide being monitored. These
data and criteria were then used to generate scheduled MRM methods
that could be applied to pre- and postsynaptic fractions from different
brain regions.

Application of Targeted Proteomics Methods
to Enriched Synaptic
Fractions
Once refined, scheduled MRM methods were applied
to in-gel-digested proteins from mouse brain-enriched pre- and postsynaptic
fractions isolated from cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum;
50 μg of total protein from each fraction was separated by SDS–PAGE
for each brain region and digested as described. Gβ peptides
were analyzed by a single 60 min scheduled MRM analysis, while Gγ
peptides were split into two 60 min scheduled MRM runs. Biological
samples were randomized to ensure any drift in assay performance would
not affect subsets disproportionately. Briefly, utilizing a trap column
setup, peptides were first loaded onto a 100 μm × 4 cm
C18 reverse phase column, which was connected in line to a 20 cm ×
100 μm (Jupiter, 3 μm, 300 Å) analytical column.
Peptides were gradient-eluted into a TSQ-Vantage instrument (Thermo
Scientific) using a nanoelectrospray source. Peptides were resolved
using an aqueous to organic gradient with a 60 min total cycle time.
Scheduled instrument methods encompassing a 10 min window around the
measured retention time along with calculated collision energies were
created using Skyline. The Q1 peak width resolution was set to 0.7;
the collision gas pressure was 1 mTorr, and a cycle time of 5 s was
utilized. The resulting RAW instrument files were imported into Skyline
for peak-picking and quantitation. Data analysis using Skyline was
performed to assess enrichment of individual G protein subunits in
pre- or postsynaptic fractions. Transition ion intensities were summed
for each precursor, and these data were used to generate extracted
ion chromatographic peaks of co-eluting transitions. As described
previously, chromatographic peaks were manually interrogated and correct
peaks chosen on the basis of retention times, dot plot values, and
relative distributions of transition ions. For peptides where a correct
peak could confidently be chosen, a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of
at least 30 was required to be included in analyses; those that did
not meet this criterion were removed from further analyses. Four internal
reference peptides, SSAAPPPPPR,
TASEFDSAIAQDK,
ELGQSGVDTYLQTK,
and LTILEELR (Table ), were used to evaluate drift in assay performance and to
allow data to be normalized. Each reference peptide (5 fmol) was spiked
into all samples and monitored throughout all MRM experiments. BSA
controls were monitored at regular intervals between samples to evaluate
instrument performance. The integrated area under the curve was calculated
for all transitions. Coefficients of variation (CVs) were calculated
for BSA controls and spiked in reference peptides using the relationship
CV = (average total AUC)/(SD of total AUC), where AUC represents the
integrated area under the curve for all transitions and SD represents
the standard deviation of the total AUC. To allow comparison between
experiments conducted on different days, the integrated area under
the curve for each peptide was normalized relative to the internal
reference peptide that was closest in retention time to it. This generated
a normalized total area for each peptide.

A modified labeled reference peptide (LRP) method was applied using the internal reference peptides
described
above to compare brain regions and subcellular fractions for each
G protein isoform. To evaluate the expression of each G protein isoform
using this method, a ratio between the normalized total area for each
peptide being monitored and the total area for one internal reference
peptide, ELGQSGVSTYLQTK,
was calculated. The ratios for all peptides monitored for a given
isoform were then averaged and the averages plotted for each protein.
Fold differences were calculated to compare expression of each G protein
isoform in pre- and postsynaptic fractions within a brain region as
well as pre- or postsynaptic fractions between brain regions. To compare
expression within a brain region, the average normalized total area
calculated from the postsynaptic fraction was divided by the average
normalized total area calculated from the presynaptic fraction of
that same region (e.g., CTX post normalized total area/CTX pre normalized
total area). To compare expression in presynaptic fractions of different
brain regions, the average normalized total area from a presynaptic
fraction in one brain area was divided by the average normalized total
area from a presynaptic fraction from another brain region (e.g.,
CTX pre normalized total area/CRB pre normalized total area). This
was also done for comparisons of postsynaptic fractions between brain
regions.

Statistical Analysis
To evaluate data for comparison
of brain regions and subcellular fractions, a two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used to account for differences in isoform expression
that could be due to their location in the CNS (i.e., CTX or CRB;
termed brain region effect), their subcellular location (i.e., pre-
or postsynaptic; termed the fraction effect), or a combination of
the two (termed the interaction effect). To determine where specific
differences in expression occurred, a Tukey post hoc test was used.
In the case of Gβ5, data were evaluated using an
unpaired t test.

Results
Synaptosome
Subcellular Fractionation Efficiency
To
assess the localization patterns of different G protein isoforms,
we made use of a brain synaptosomal preparation and subcellular fractionation
protocol that would allow us to reduce sample complexity (Figure A). Synaptosomes are a widely used preparation for
studying synaptic biochemistry as they contain the complete presynaptic
terminus, including mitochondria and synaptic vesicles, as well as
the postsynaptic membrane and postsynaptic density (PSD)., To verify the efficiency of our fractionation protocol, we examined
the enrichment of well-established synaptic markers in our pre- and
postsynaptic fractions. Protein (7 μg of total protein) from
each isolated fraction was separated on SDS–PAGE gels, electroblotted
onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunostained with antibodies against
NMDAR1, PSD-95, GAPDH, syntaxin-1, and Gβ. Figure B reveals the high level of enrichment of NMDAR1 and PSD-95
in the postsynaptic fraction, whereas the presynaptic fraction is
enriched with syntaxin-1. Although syntaxin-1 is thought to be primarily
concentrated at the site of neurotransmitter release in neurons, it
has also been shown to be expressed postsynaptically, accounting for its presence in the postsynaptic fraction
following enrichment in this study. Conversely, GAPDH, a cytosolic
protein, shows equal levels of expression in both fractions, although
the level of expression in pre- and postsynaptic fractions was lower
than that seen in cytosolic fractions (data not shown). Similarly,
Gβ was expressed equally in both pre- and postsynaptic factions
using a pan-Gβ antibody (Figure B).

Development and Validation of Targeted Mass Spectrometry Methods
Target peptides and transitions for MRM studies were obtained by
analyzing purified, recombinant Gβγ proteins (Gβ1, Gβ5, Gγ2, Gγ4, Gγ5, Gγ7, Gγ11, and Gγ13) when available, as well as enriched
pre- and postsynaptic fractions from mouse cortex. Figure A illustrates a schematic of the workflow for targeted
MRM development. In silico tryptic digests were initially
performed and peptides that were unique to a single G protein isoform
preselected. Peptides were then further screened for uniqueness by
performing a protein basic local alignment search tool search. Only
precursor peptides unique to a single G protein isoform and not found
in protein sequences belonging to related or unrelated proteins were
chosen (Table ). Following tryptic digestion,
extracted peptides from purified G protein samples were initially
analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer, while those from
enriched pre- and postsynaptic fractions were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap
Velos mass spectrometer. Data-dependent LC–MS/MS runs identified
&gt;200 proteins in synaptic fractions from gel regions corresponding
to the expected molecular weight of Gβ and Gγ subunits
(data not shown). From these initial experiments, peptides corresponding
to four of the five Gβ isoforms (Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ4, and Gβ5) were identified
and validated, as well as eight of the Gγ isoforms (Gγ2, Gγ3, Gγ4, Gγ5, Gγ7, Gγ11, Gγ12, and Gγ13). Unique peptides corresponding
to Gβ3, Gγ8, and Gγ10 were not identified in subcellular fractions during discovery experiments.
Polymorphisms in the Gβ3 gene have been shown to
dramatically alter its amino acid sequence; Gγ8 is expressed only in olfactory and vomeronasal
neuroepithelia, and Gγ10 is only a minor isoform in the CNS. Such factors may account for why we were unable to identify unique
peptides using published sequences. These isoforms were excluded from
the targeted LC–MS/MS analysis. Further, Gγ1 was not investigated, as its expression is limited to the retina. Figure B shows a representative
spectrum for the LC–MS/MS identification of a Gβ1 peptide, ACADATLSQITNNIDPVGR.
Gβγ precursor peptides with appropriate m/z values (&lt;5 ppm relative to theoretical values)
were fragmented to generate MS/MS spectra. Unique precursor peptides
identified in data-dependent runs were verified by manual interrogation
of the MS/MS spectra and product ions ranked on the basis of intensity.
Discovery experiments were leveraged such that isoform specific peptides
showing both a strong signal and fragmentation were chosen as precursors
and transitions for monitoring via MRM. Chromatographic peaks were
selected using criteria previously described. If purified samples
were available, the RTs of peptides identified in complex mixtures
had to match the RTs for those of the purified sample (Figure C). Similarly, relative intensities of transitions
were required to mirror those of purified samples and correlate closely
with that seen in discovery experiments (Figure C). Dot plot values were used as an aid to assess how well MRM results
matched MS/MS data obtained with the Orbitrap. MRM methods were refined
to pare down the number of peptides and transition ions being evaluated.
Table  shows the list of finalized precursor
peptides and product ions being monitored in MRM experiments for each
G protein isoform in experimental samples.

following analysis of purified Gβ1 (top), and equivalent
transitions were evident upon analysis of pre- and postsynaptic fractions
isolated from mouse brain cortical tissue (middle and bottom, respectively).

Evaluating Regional and
Subcellular G Protein Localization Patterns
We next applied
our refined MRM method to subcellular fractions
isolated from mouse cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum.
All four of the β isoforms (Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ4, and Gβ5) being targeted
were detected in pre- and postsynaptic fractions in all four brain
regions, as well as six of the eight γ isoforms (Gγ2, Gγ3, Gγ4, Gγ7, Gγ12, and Gγ13). Chromatographic
peaks of monitored transition ions could not be confidently identified
for Gγ5 and Gγ11 despite the fact
that target peptides had been validated using recombinant proteins
in the development phase. Gγ11 is thought to be a
minor isoform in the brain with the highest level of expression in
lung and platelets. Further, both Gγ5 and Gγ11 undergo post-translational processing;, this was not included in method development and could explain why
peptides could not be confidently identified in CNS fractions. Neither
isoform was included in analyses. No significant variance in system
performance was observed across quality control (QC) runs as measured
by examining BSA peptide peak areas across the experiment or peak
area coefficients of variation (CVs) for replicate QC analyses (Figure
1 of the ). Similarly,
no significant drift in assay performance was observed as measured
by monitoring peak areas as well peak area CVs for internal reference
peptides (Figures 2 and 3 of the ). Although stable isotope dilution (SID) is the gold standard for
quantifying protein expression,, its cost-prohibitive
nature prevented its use when trying to evaluate a large number of
G protein isoforms. Instead, application of an LRP method allowed the relative abundance of G protein
isoforms to be examined. With this method, direct comparisons between
isoforms cannot be made; rather, comparisons are only possible across
brain regions and subcellular fractions for each individual isoform,
as described below. As a result, average normalized areas for each
isoform were each plotted on different axes in Figures  and .

results were as follows: (A) Gγ2, brain region effect p = 0.002 and fraction effect p = 0.0035;
(B) Gγ3, brain region effect p =
0.0125 and fraction effect p = 0.0003; (C) Gγ4, brain region effect p = 0.0093, fraction

Gβ Isoforms
Subcellular localization patterns
were evaluated for each of the four Gβ isoforms being monitored
by MRM. Although there was a trend toward higher levels of expression
of Gβ1 and Gβ4 in the cortex and
cerebellum, expression levels were not significantly different within
or across most brain regions for three of the four isoforms (Figure A–C). Within the striatum, however, Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ4 were all
expressed at significantly higher levels in the postsynaptic fraction
than in the presynaptic fraction (Figure A–C).
An interaction effect was seen for Gβ1 (ANOVA p value = 0.0321), specifically, a Gβ1 Str
post/Str pre fold difference of 2.63, with a p value
of &lt;0.05 (Table 1 of the ), whereas there were brain region, fraction, and interaction effects
for Gβ2 [ANOVA p values of 0.0362,
0.0039, and 0.0023, respectively; Gβ2 Str post/Str
pre fold difference of 3.78, with a p value of &lt;0.001 (Table 2
of the )] and a fraction
effect for Gβ4 [ANOVA p value =
0.0066; Str post/Str pre fold difference of 4.06, with a p value of &lt;0.05 (Table 3 of the )]. In addition, the level of postsynaptic expression
of Gβ2 was significantly greater in the striatum
than in postsynaptic fractions from the cortex, cerebellum, or hippocampus
[Figure B; Str post/CTX post fold difference
of 1.55, with a p value of &lt;0.05; Str post/CRB
post fold difference of 1.08, with a p value of &lt;0.01;
Str post/Hippo post fold difference of 2.08, with a p value of &lt;0.05 (Table 2 of the )]. In comparison, Gβ5 was detected
in only the striatum on the basis of our peak criteria and S/N requirements
(Figure D). As was seen for the other Gβ
isoforms, the level of expression of Gβ5 was significantly
higher in the postsynaptic fraction than in the presynaptic fraction
[Figure D; Str post/Str pre fold difference
of 4.07, with a p value of &lt;0.05 (Table 4 of the )].

Gγ Isoforms
In contrast to the Gβ isoforms,
the Gγ isoforms showed greater diversity in their subcellular
and regional localization patterns. Gγ2, Gγ3, Gγ4, Gγ7, Gγ12, and Gγ13 were clearly detected in each
of the four brain regions being studied. In the case of Gγ2, no significant differences in regional or subcellular fractions
were observed, except within the hippocampus. The level of expression
of this isoform was found to be significantly greater in the postsynaptic
fraction of the hippocampus than in the cerebellum (Figure A). There were brain region and fraction effects
for Gγ2 (ANOVA p values of 0.002
and 0.0035, respectively), specifically, a Gγ2 Hippo
post/CRB post fold difference of 3.61, with a p value
of &lt;0.05 (Table 5 of the ). Additionally, there was a trend toward higher levels of expression
in the postsynaptic fraction of the hippocampus and striatum compared
to presynaptic fractions within these same regions (Figure A). Similar patterns of expression were observed
for Gγ3. No significant differences were observed
across the four brain regions. When comparisons were made between
subcellular fractions, however, there was a trend toward higher levels
of expression in postsynaptic fractions, although this was only significant
within the striatum (Figure B). In this case,
there were also brain region and fraction effects (ANOVA p values of 0.0125 and 0.0003, respectively), specifically, a Gγ3 Str post/Str pre fold difference of 2.60, with a p value of &lt;0.05 (Table 6 of the ). Gγ4 and Gγ7 were somewhat different in that significant differences were
observed in both regional and subcellular expression. There were brain
region, fraction, and interaction effects for both isoforms (Gγ4 ANOVA p values of 0.0093, 0.001, and 0.04,
respectively; Gγ7 ANOVA p value
of &lt;0.0001 for all three effects). In the case of Gγ4, the level of postsynaptic expression in the hippocampus
and striatum was found to be significantly greater than that in the
cerebellum [Figure C; Hippo post/CRB post
fold difference of 4.00, with a p value of &lt;0.05;
Str post/CRB post fold change of 3.83, with a p value
of &lt;0.05 (Table 7 of the )]. Further, while there was a trend toward a higher level of expression
in the postsynaptic fraction than in the presynaptic fraction within
both the hippocampus and striatum, it was only significant within
the striatum [Figure C; Str post/Str pre fold
difference of 3.71, with a p value of &lt;0.05 (Table
7 of the )]. Expression
of Gγ7 was not significantly different between pre-
and postsynaptic fractions in the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus.
Within the striatum, however, the level of expression was significantly
higher in the postsynaptic fraction than in the presynaptic fraction
[Figure D; Str post/Str pre fold difference
of 5.55, with a p value of &lt;0.0001 (Table 8 of
the )]. Further,
the level of postsynaptic expression of this isoform was significantly
higher in the striatum than in the postsynaptic fraction in each of
the other three brain regions [Figure D; Str
post/CTX post fold difference of 5.47, with a p value
of &lt;0.0001; Str post/CRB post fold difference of 8.41, with a p value of &lt;0.0001; Str post/Hippo post fold difference
of 3.13, with a p value of &lt;0.0001 (Table 8 of
the )]. Gγ12 was unique among the isoforms in that although no regional
differences were observed, the level of subcellular expression was
significantly higher in postsynaptic fractions across all brain regions
than in presynaptic fractions (Figure E).
There were brain region and fraction effects for Gγ12 [CTX post/CTX pre fold difference of 2.81, with a p value of &lt;0.01; CRB post/CRB pre fold difference of 3.16, with
a p value of &lt;0.001; Hippo post/Hippo pre fold
change of 5.36, with a p value of &lt;0.05; Str post/Str
pre fold difference of 10.46, with a p value of &lt;0.001
(Table 9 of the )].
Finally, Gγ13 exhibited both regional and subcellular
differences in localization, and there were both brain region and
fraction effects for this isoform (ANOVA p value
of &lt;0.0001 in both cases). The level of expression of this isoform
in the cortex was found to be significantly higher in both the pre-
and postsynaptic fractions than in the hippocampus and striatum [Figure F; CTX pre/Hippo pre fold difference of 4.03, with
a p value of &lt;0.05; CTX pre/Str pre fold difference
of 8.76, with a p value of &lt;0.01; CTX post/Str
post fold difference of 2.86, with a p value of &lt;0.05
(Table 10 of the )]. Similarly, the level of expression of Gγ13 was
found to be significantly higher in the postsynaptic fraction of the
cerebellum than in the postsynaptic fractions of the hippocampus and
striatum [Figure F; CRB post/Hippo post fold
difference of 2.38, with a p value of &lt;0.01; CRB
post/Str post fold difference of 3.06, with a p value
of &lt;0.01 (Table 10 of the )]. No significant differences in subcellular localization were observed
in the cortex, hippocampus, or striatum, but the level of expression
was significantly higher in the postsynaptic fraction within the cerebellum
than in the presynaptic fraction [Figure F;
CRB post/CRB pre fold difference of 2.22, with a p value of &lt;0.01 (Table 10 of the )].

Discussion
G protein βγ
subunits are known to play essential roles
in cellular communication via complex regulatory mechanisms. Increasingly,
studies are demonstrating that receptors and effectors preferentially
interact with unique complements of Gβγ isoforms,,,,− suggesting that precise regulation of expression
and localization is important for maintaining
the fidelity of signaling pathways. Transcript expression suggests
these isoforms are distributed across many brain regions, but less
is known about protein localization as a high level of sequence identity
makes development of subunit specific antibodies difficult. The novel
application of MRM techniques to this question allows accurate identification
and quantification of endogenous Gβγ subunits from complex
mixtures of brain tissue. With this approach, we demonstrate brain
region specific differences in the protein expression patterns of
individual G protein β and γ isoforms in pre- and postsynaptic
fractions. We employed an LRP method to evaluate the relative expression
of each isoform, as SID methods that include labeled internal protein
standards for each peptide being monitored are cost-prohibitive given
the number of peptides to be analyzed. Zhang et al. recently showed that an LRP method is a reasonable alternative
to SID as it is well suited for comparing relative protein levels
and is capable of detecting the same significant differences in biological
samples. Application of this technique to this study is a first required
step toward a more complete understanding of specificity in Gβγ
signaling. The observed differences suggest neuronal cells would be
able to channel information differentially through signaling complexes
and second-messenger pathways in different brain regions.

Differential
Expression and Distribution of Gβγ
Isoforms between Brain Regions
Several studies have demonstrated
that Gβ and Gγ isoforms show differential patterns of
expression throughout the CNS. Although the data obtained in those
studies are in general agreement with those presented here, ours is
the first to provide a comprehensive map of their protein distribution
to distinct subcellular fractions; previously, only Gβ1 has been reported in both the presynaptic active zone and PSD. Gβ1 is expressed ubiquitously throughout the brain,, correlating well with our findings that this isoform could be detected
at comparable levels within pre- and postsynaptic fractions across
most of the brain regions examined (Figure A). A similar range of levels of expression was observed for Gβ2 and Gβ4 (Figure B,C). In vitro data show that Gβ1, Gβ2, and Gβ4 can all pair with
numerous Gγ isoforms, as well as couple to a variety of receptors
and effectors. While this implies involvement
in a wide range of signaling pathways and supports the broad distribution
we observed, their function in vivo is poorly understood.
What is known is that Gβ1 plays an important role
in neural development; its removal is perinatally lethal, and pups
exhibit reduced cortical thickness, reduced brain volume, and impaired
neural progenitor cell proliferation. Comparatively, Gβ2 may play a role in neuronal
excitability as mice in which Gγ3 is lost exhibit a severe seizure
phenotype and a reduction in the level of Gβ2 within
the cortex, cerebellum, and striatum., Further, knockdown
studies demonstrate Gβ1, Gβ2, and
Gβ4 each signal downstream of specific GPCRs found
throughout the CNS., The extensive expression patterns
we observed for each isoform may thus be expected, as a broad distribution
would be required to support such diverse signaling pathways.

In contrast to the other Gβ isoforms, expression of Gβ5 was seen exclusively within the striatum, as levels within
the cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were below the limit of detection
(Figure D). This result differs from previously
published reports that suggested a wide distribution similar to that
of the other Gβ isoforms.,, While we cannot rule out that such disparity reflects physiological
differences in the expression of the protein product or differential
post-translational processing between brain regions, such a limited
distribution may also correspond to the interaction of Gβ5 with regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. Gβ5 forms a stable obligate dimer with members of the RGS R7
subfamily to modulate Gi-mediated signal transduction pathways.− One member, RGS9-2, is enriched in the striatum, and the RGS9-2–Gβ5 complex is localized to the membrane through its interaction
the R7 family binding protein (R7BP).,− Conversely, RGS7–Gβ5 complexes are found intracellularly
throughout the CNS., This may explain why, in this
study, Gβ5 could be detected only in the striatum.
Our fractionation protocol aimed to enrich the presynaptic active
zone membrane fraction as well as the PSD membrane fraction, while
cytosolic fractions were not analyzed. The Gβ5–RGS9-2
association with the plasma membrane in the striatum is consistent
with our detection of Gβ5 in this region. Further,
as R7BP and RGS9-2 colocalize predominantly to postsynaptic membranes,, enrichment of Gβ5 in postsynaptic fractions within
this region would be expected (Figure D).
If, in other brain regions, Gβ5 is primarily complexed
with RGS7 and found intracellularly, it would not have been detected
in this study as these fractions were not analyzed. Further efforts
will be needed to determine whether Gβ5 can be detected
in cytosolic fractions to address this hypothesis.

In comparison,
the Gγ subunits show more varied expression
patterns; however, with the exception of Gγ5 and
Gγ11, each isoform could be clearly identified within
each of the four brain regions examined (Figure ). Although immunohistochemical studies have localized particular
isoforms to the CNS in general, a detailed examination of their expression
to brain regions and cell types has been limited to transcript levels., For some Gγ isoforms, transcript expression reported previously
correlates well with the localization patterns observed in this study,
whereas in others it differs notably. For example, using in
situ hybridization, Betty et al. showed strong expression of Gγ7 within the striatum,
followed closely by the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum, similar
to what is seen in this study (Figure D).
Conversely, the authors reported Gγ4 to be strongly
expressed in the hippocampus and cerebellum but more weakly in the
striatum, whereas our analyses show the opposite: strong expression
in the striatum but significantly lower levels in the cerebellum (Figure C). It is difficult to say whether these differences
reflect physiological effects relating to the expression of the protein
product or possible protein modifications that were not identified
in this study. One factor that may contribute to the disparities,
however, is that this study examined expression patterns at subcellular
levels. In comparison, previous in situ studies were
able to evaluate Gγ expression at only the cellular level, which
would have included both the soma and the nerve terminals. Thus, direct
comparison between such studies is not possible.

Little is known
about the subcellular distribution of Gγ
isoforms within the CNS. Moricano et al. localized Gγ3 to the presynaptic active zone, but
subcellular localization patterns for the remaining Gγ isoforms
have not been previously evaluated. The wide discrepancy in expression
patterns within subcellular fractions and across the four brain regions
could reflect unique contributions by each isoform to unique signaling
pathways. This is supported by the distinct phenotypes observed when
Gγ isoforms are genetically knocked out. In the case of Gγ3, genetic deletion results in mice with an increased susceptibility
to seizures, as well as resistance to diet-induced obesity, implying
a role in neuronal excitability and regulation of appetite or metabolism., Loss of Gγ3 suppresses the expression of Gβ1 and Gβ2 within the cortex, cerebellum, and
striatum, implicating a Gβ1/2γ3 dimer
within these regions and in agreement with our expression results
(Figure B). It is noteworthy that significant
enrichment of Gγ3 was observed in the postsynaptic
fraction of the striatum. Although further efforts are needed to understand
the physiological consequences of this finding, one possibility may
be related to the activity of μ-opioid receptors within this
region. The loss of Gγ3 results in defective signaling
through the μ-opioid receptor. Within
the striatum, these receptors have been implicated in the hedonic
response to food, and act via a postsynaptic mechanism. As a result, the enrichment seen in the postsynaptic
fraction of the striatum could represent an important signaling cascade
activated by μ-opioid receptors and involving the Gγ3 subunit; further efforts will be needed to explore this possibility.
In comparison, animals in which Gγ7 has been knocked
out exhibit an enhanced startle response, which may result from defective
D1 dopamine and A2A adenosine receptor activation
within the striatum.,, This correlates well with our finding, and previously published
reports,, that Gγ7 is most strongly
expressed in the striatum (Figure D). While
further efforts will be needed to confirm the exact mechanism, given
that both D1 and A2A receptors are localized
primarily to dendritic spines,, the fact that we observed
significant enrichment of Gγ7 within the postsynaptic
fraction (Figure D) suggests a predominately
postsynaptic role for Gγ7 within this region.

Although no genetically modified animals are available for Gγ2 and Gγ4, knockdown of these isoforms offers
insight into the expression patterns we observed. Early work by Kalkbrenner
et al. demonstrated that silencing of
endogenous Gγ2 and Gγ4 in cultured
cells reduced the extent of galanin-induced calcium inhibition. More
recently, a role in nociception was suggested for Gγ2, as injection of antisense oligonucleotides into the CNS of mice
attenuated the analgesic effects of opioid, cannabinoid, and adrenergic
agonists., Such a range of effector interactions
would be expected to contribute to the observed localization patterns.
Galanin, cannabinoid, and adrenergic receptors all exhibit a broad
distribution in the CNS, while opioid
receptor subtypes are highly expressed within the striatum and cortex.− As a result, if Gγ2 and Gγ4 acted
via these receptors in vivo, the wide distribution
we observed (Figure A,C) could exist because
their expression parallels that of their target GPCRs.

Finding
Gγ13 within each of the brain regions
we examined was exciting as this G protein has largely been reported
in sensory tissues, where it is required for olfactory and gustatory
transduction. While transcript expression
within the brain closely mirrors our results, (Figure F), little is known about the function
of this isoform in the CNS. Gγ13 has been shown to
interact with the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 via a PDZ binding C-terminal
sequence, and the two proteins can be efficiently pulled down together
from brain lysates. It is possible that
this association aids in targeting the G protein to particular subcellular
locations and/or facilitates interactions with appropriate effectors
such as GIRK channels and PLCβ2, accounting for the stronger expression of Gγ13 in postsynaptic fractions (Figure F).

Additional Factors That May Contribute to Differential Expression
Patterns
In addition to signaling requirements, other factors
are likely to influence the observed localization patterns. A striking
feature from our data was that while most G protein isoforms were
found in all four brain regions, prominent differences were observed
between regions. Such disparity may reflect G protein expression within
individual cell types as well as patterns of innervation to specific
brain regions. For example, the striatum is composed largely of γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA)-containing medium spiny neurons yet receives excitatory
inputs from the cortex and dopaminergic innervations from the midbrain., Glutamatergic pyramidal neurons predominate in the hippocampus,
but this region also receives monoamine and cholinergic inputs from
the median raphe,, locus coeruleus, and basal forebrain. In contrast, the cerebellum could be considered more homogeneous
as Purkinje cells represent the sole output of the cerebellar cortex,
but even these integrate excitatory afferent pathways as well as strong
inhibitory GABAergic inputs. Such diversity
in cell type and innervation patterns may provide clues about why
differences in G protein expression patterns were observed between
brain regions as well as subcellular fractions. This is supported
by early work by Betty et al. and Liang
et al., as well as the more recent effort
or Schwindinger et al. Thus, G protein
expression within particular cell types, as well as the innervation
within a brain region, would influence the results seen in our study.
Synaptosomal preparations and subcellular fractionation techniques
such as those described do not allow Gβγ expression patterns
to be evaluated endogenously within specific cell types. However,
with recent advances in optogenetics, transgenic mice that express
fluorescent proteins under the control of cell-type specific promoters
are becoming available. By taking advantage of these mice in future
studies, we will be able to evaluate localization patterns within
specific neuron populations and subcellular fractions to determine
if these factors contribute to the expression of specific isoforms.

Summary
In summary, we report that G protein β and
γ isoforms
exhibit distinct patterns of localization across brain regions as
well as subcellular fractions. This is particularly interesting as
it implies specific functions for individual isoforms in modulating
cellular responses and signaling cascades. Further efforts will be
necessary to determine the relevance of these patterns of distribution
and to evaluate which Gβγ dimers exist endogenously and
the contribution each makes to cellular communication.
