Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) are byproducts of fossil fuel combustion and are therefore
ubiquitous environmental contaminants in airborne particulates and cigarette smoke. In mammalian cells, PAH compounds are metabolically activated to
reactive intermediates by several different pathways that can cause
DNA damage and the formation of unstable and stable− DNA adducts. The widely studied cytochrome P450 pathway generates mutagenic and tumorigenic
PAH diol epoxide derivatives, that react with the
exocyclic amino groups of guanine and adenine in DNA to form various
stereoisomeric DNA adducts., Such DNA adducts have
been found in PAH-treated or PAH diol epoxide-treated eukaryotic cells.−

The carcinogenic activities of PAH compounds and their diol
epoxide
metabolites depend on the number of aromatic rings and their topological
arrangements.,− A striking example of such differences
in structure–activity relationships is the tumorigenic activity
of the fjord region six-ring PAH dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P) that
is ∼100-fold greater than the
activity of the bay region five-ring benzo[a]pyrene
(B[a]P).−,− There is significant evidence that adducts derived
from the reactions with DNA of dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-11,12-dihydrodiol-13,14-epoxide (DB[a,l]PDE), the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of
DB[a,l]P, are persistent in human, and mouse, cells. Indeed, several of the
stereoisomeric 14S and 14R DNA adducts
derived from the binding of (−)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE to N6-adenine are resistant to nucleotide excision repair (NER) in human
cell extracts,, while the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct is modestly
repaired. In contrast to the DB[a,l]P-derived DNA adducts, the stereoisomeric bay region guanine B[a]P-N2-dG and adenine B[a]P-N6-dA adducts with R and S stereochemistry at the C10 linkage
site in double-stranded DNA are more efficiently incised., Tumor initiation is a complex, multistage process that includes
metabolic activation, the formation of different adducts from a particular
PAH adduct, and lesion repair. Moreover,
diverse PAHs yield adducts with differing topologies. Dissecting the
roles of each of these factors remains an important challenge. A current
goal of our research is to discover the contribution made by the different
NER efficiencies of the various lesions to the tumorigenic potential
of the parent PAH. A basic understanding of these NER differences
requires insights into the structural features of these DNA adducts
and their relationships to biological function.

The objectives
of this work were to compare the effects of the
aromatic ring system size and topology on the structural features
of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct and the previously established structures of the stereochemically
analogous 10S-B[a]P-dG, and 1S-B[c]Ph-dG adducts, as well as the stereoisomeric 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct (Figure A). We thereby
further our understanding of the DNA lesion structure–function
relationship in the NER mechanism. However, NMR studies of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct have
not yet been presented. Therefore, the focus of this study was to
establish the conformational properties of this adduct in a fully
complementary 11-mer DNA duplex and in a “deletion”
(Del) duplex that lacks a single nucleotide opposite the lesion (Figure B) using NMR and molecular modeling approaches.
The conformations of the full duplexes are important for understanding
their recognition by cellular DNA repair systems, while the structures
of the Del duplexes yield important further insights into the effect
of base sequence context on bulky PAH carcinogen–DNA interactions.

(A) Chemical
structures of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG, 10S-B[a]P-dG,
and 1S-B[c]Ph-dG
adducts. The torsion angles α′ (N1–C2–N2–C14),
β′ (C2–N2–C14–C13), and δ′
(C15–C17–C20–C1) for the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct are indicated.
The 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG
adducts are derived from the trans addition reaction
of (−)-dibenzo[a,l]pyrene-11R,12S-dihydrodiol 13S,14R-epoxide [(−)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE] with N2-dG,
while the 14R stereoisomeric adduct is derived from
a similar trans addition reaction with the (+)-anti-14S,13R,12R,11S enantiomer. The 10S-B[a]P-dG and 1S-B[c]Ph-dG adducts are generated by similar trans addition reactions with the stereochemically analogous
(+)-7R,8S,9S,10R and (−)-1S,2R,3R,4S diol epoxide enantiomers
derived from benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph), respectively. (B) Sequences investigated.

Methods
Synthesis and Purification
of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Oligonucleotide Adducts
Caution: DB[a,l]PDE is highly tumorigenic and
must be handled with the utmost care to prevent contact with the skin,
contamination of laboratory benches, or laboratory items.

Racemic mixtures of the anti-DB[a,l]PDE isomer were provided by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) Chemical Repository for Chemical Carcinogenesis Research.
The DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT) and purified by reversed phase HPLC using a C-18 column with
a methanol/phosphate gradient. Their masses were verified by MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry. The 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct was synthesized, using previously described
methods, in the 5′-CCATCGCTACC-3′
sequence, which has been well studied by our group for different PAH-derived
guanine adducts (e.g., refs (), (), (), and ()) and was selected to facilitate
structural and functional comparisons. Briefly, ∼3 mg of (±)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE was dissolved
in 350 μL of THF and added to an 8 mg buffer solution of 5′-CCATCGCTACC-3′
[25 mM sodium acetate, 25 mM Tris, and 25 mM TEAA (pH 11)]. An additional
350 μL of a THF solution was added to this solution, which was
then stirred in the dark at room temperature for 8 days, during which
the diol epoxides are stable at pH 11, because their acid-catalyzed
hydrolysis is suppressed in this highly alkaline environment. The
reaction was stopped by adding 3.5 mL of a 1:1 ethyl acetate/ethyl
ether mixture, and the organic phase was extracted to remove DB[a,l]P. The solution was then centrifuged
to remove solid residues, and all glassware was decontaminated by
being rinsed with dilute acid solutions. The products of the synthesis
were purified using multiple reversed phase HPLC steps as described
previously. Briefly, the modified oliognucleotides
were separated from unreacted oligonucleotides using a PRP-1 column
with a 5 to 50% acetonitrile/50 mM TEAA buffer gradient in 60 min.
The modified stereoisomeric oligonucleotides were then further separated
using a 10 to 25% acetonitrile/50 mM TEAA buffer solution in 60 min.
The masses of the modified oligonucleotides were determined by MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry methods that verified that the oligonucleotides
contained a single modified nucleotide residue. The absolute configuration
of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG (G*) adduct was determined by digesting the modified 5′-CCATCG*CTACC
to the nucleoside level dG* and verifying its stereochemical properties
by circular dichroism methods.

The duplexes that were used in these experiments were generated
by annealing the purified PAH-modified 11-mer sequence with the complementary
unmodified strand using standard methods of mixing the two strands
in 1:1 proportions, then heating the solutions at 90 °C for 2
min, and then allowing for slow cooling and annealing of the two strands.

NMR Measurements
14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Deletion Duplex
The two-dimensional
nuclear Overhauser
effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra for the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG deletion duplex adduct (Figure B) in a D2O phosphate buffer solution
at 20 and 15 °C were recorded with mixing times of 40, 70, 120,
200, 250, and 300 ms utilizing a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer
at the Shared Instrumentation Facility (SIF) at New York University.
The NOESY spectra in a 90% H2O/10% D2O buffer
solution with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms at 15 °C (or 150
ms at 4 °C) to visualize the imino proton spectra were recorded
with the same Bruker Avance 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. All NOESY data
sets were acquired using phase sensitive pulse sequences recorded
with the States–TPPI method. The relaxation delay was set to
1.85 s with 512 FIDs, and each FID was recorded with 104 transient
scans with 2K complex data points and a spectral width of 10.5 ppm
in both dimensions for the spectra in D2O. The spectral
width was 21 ppm for the corresponding spectra in H2O.
The data sets were processed with the standard Bruker processing software
package (TOPSPIN version 1.3). Peak assignments were made using SPARKY. Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and total correlation
spectroscopy (TOCSY) methods with mixing times of 80 ms in a D2O buffer solution at 15 and 20 °C were used for the assignment
of the critical cytosine H5–H6 and DB[a,l]P aromatic ring protons in the adduct duplex. The acquisition
of the TOCSY and COSY spectra was the same as that for the NOESY spectra.
The NMR buffer solution consisted of 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 100 mM NaCl (pH 6.8), and 25 nM DSS (2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate,
sodium salt) was used as a 0 ppm reference marker.

14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Full Duplex
The two-dimensional NOESY spectra of 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG in the full
duplex (Figure B) in a D2O phosphate
buffer solution at 11 °C were recorded with mixing times of 50,
100, 200, and 250 ms, at temperatures of 5, 25, and 35 °C. The
spectra were recorded utilizing a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer
equipped with a cryoprobe at the New York Structural Biology Center
(NYSBC). The NOESY spectra in a 90% H2O/10% D2O buffer solution with mixing times of 175 and 250 ms at 15 °C,
or 125 and 150 ms at 4 °C to visualize the imino protons, were
recorded with the Bruker Avance 500 MHz NMR spectrometer at New York
University. The conditions for NOESY spectra and data processing were
the same in the full and deletion duplexes, and the relaxation delays
were set to 1.5 s in D2O (1.2 s in H2O). TOCSY
methods with mixing times of 60 ms in a D2O buffer solution
at 5, 11, 15, 25, and 35 °C were used for the assignment of the
critical cytosine H5–H6 and DB[a,l]P aromatic ring protons in the adducted duplex. Data acquisition
for the TOCSY spectra was the same as for the NOESY spectra.

MD Simulations: Initial Models
14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Nucleoside
The initial
model for the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct on the nucleoside
level was built from the high-resolution NMR solution structure of
the fjord region analogue 1S-B[c]Ph-dG (Figure A) with the same stereochemistry at the linkage site and positioned
in the identical sequence context. Molecular modeling was employed
to extract the modified nucleoside from the 11-mer duplex that was
capped with hydrogen atoms at positions O3′ and O5′.
We then added two aromatic rings to the B[c]Ph residue
to create the initial model of the 14S-DB[a,l]P adduct. This model was subjected
to geometry optimization utilizing Gaussian 03 at the B3LYP/6-31G* level.

14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Deletion Duplex
The initial
model of the adduct in
the deletion duplex adopted here was based on the previously established
structure of the 10S-B[a]P-dG·Del
11/10-mer adduct duplex to provide a
DNA deletion duplex structure. However, the B[a]P
moiety in the latter structure was excised and replaced with the DB[a,l]P residue structure that was obtained
through QM geometry optimization as described above, and minor steric
clashes due to close contacts were alleviated with molecular modeling.
This approach yielded an intercalation conformation as a starting
model that is consistent with the NMR data (see ).

14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Full Duplex
The initial model was based on the NMR
solution structure of the stereochemically analogous 10S-B[a]P-dG adduct positioned
in the minor groove in the identical sequence context, replacing the
B[a]P moiety with the DB[a,l]P residue as described above for the deletion duplex.
This model was adopted because the NMR data suggest that the DB[a,l]P residue in the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG full duplex is positioned
in the minor groove (see ). Minor close
contacts were alleviated by molecular modeling. Visualization and
model building were performed with INSIGHT II (Accelrys Software,
Inc.). PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC) was employed to make molecular
images and movies.

MD Protocols
The protocol we utilized
to obtain the
NMR distance-refined structures entailed unrestrained MD simulations
for 3 ns for the initial models, followed by distance-restrained MD
simulation for 1 ns. MD simulations were conducted using the AMBER
9 package, and the Cornell et al. force
field with the parm99.dat parameter set. The partial charges of the modified nucleoside
were computed utilizing quantum mechanical Hartree–Fock calculations
with the 6-31G* basis set employing the Gaussian 03 package. The charges were then fit to each atomic center
with the RESP algorithm., Other force field parameters
used for the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct were assigned to be consistent with the rest of the
AMBER force field. Tables S1 and S2 () list these force field parameters. The details
of the MD simulation protocol are provided in the . For the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG deletion duplex, five representative
structures were extracted from the restrained MD simulation using
the PTRAJ module of AMBER 9 and used
for analyses. For the full duplex, one minor groove structure that
best represented the NMR data based on the intermolecular NOEs was
selected to describe the structural features of this adduct. The sixth-root R factor (Rx) was calculated
by CORMA to evaluate the best representative
structure derived from the restrained MD simulation

Exchangeable Proton Spectra
The
one-dimensional (1D)
exchangeable proton spectrum (10.5–13.8 ppm) of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·Del
11/10-mer duplex in H2O buffer (pH 6.8) at 15 °C is
shown in Figure A. The imino proton assignments
are based on the analysis of the NOE imino–imino proton cross-peaks,
and cross-peaks between imino protons and other nearby protons in
the Watson–Crick partner flanking base pairs., We observed eight well-resolved imino proton resonances, including
two upfield-shifted imino proton resonances at 11.16 and 10.72 ppm.
The two terminal imino protons, G22 and G12, could not be clearly
identified because of terminal fraying at 15 °C. The unpaired
G6*(NH1) proton could not be identified either, thus indicating fraying
and fast exchange with the solvent. The sharp imino proton resonances
are characteristic of a well-defined single conformer.

11/10-mer deletion duplex.
(A) One-dimensional imino proton spectrum
of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·Del adduct in H2O recorded at 15 °C in
a 500 MHz spectrometer in a buffer solution (pH 6.8) (10.5–13.8
ppm). (B) Portion of a 2D NOESY (200 ms mixing time, 15 °C) contour
plot spectrum focused on the symmetric imino-to-imino (10.5–13.8
ppm) region. The sequential assignment is traced starting at G21 to
G18 and from G16 to G13. No imino-to-imino NOE cross-peak is observed
between G16 and G18. (C) Portion of a 2D NOESY (200 ms mixing time,
15 °C) contour plot focused on the imino (10.5–13.8 ppm)
to amino/base (5.5–8.8 ppm) proton region. Box I shows the
characteristic Watson–Crick hydrogen-bonded thymine imino–adenine
H2 proton resonances. Box II shows the characteristic Watson–Crick
hydrogen-bonded guanine imino–cytosine amino proton NOEs. In
particular, NOE connectivities between the imino proton of G16 and
G18 and their complementary base amino groups are shown. Labels A–F
in panel C are as follows: (A) DB[a,l]P(H14)–16(NH1), (B) DB[a,l]P(H3)–18(NH1), (C) 15(H2)–16(NH1), (D) 19(H2)–18(H1),
(E) DB[a,l]P(H5)–16(NH1),
and (F) DB[a,l]P(H4)–18(NH1).

Figure B depicts a portion of a NOESY (200
ms mixing time) contour plot at 15 °C in the symmetrical 10.5–13.8
ppm region. The imino–imino proton sequential assignments are
shown by solid lines for the central 8 bp starting from T20 to G13.
The sequential assignments can be traced without interruption from
G21 to G18 and from G16 to G13. The terminal G12 and G22 are not discernible
because of terminal end fraying effects. The absence of the connectivities
between G6*(NH1) and G16(NH1) or G18(NH1) imino protons indicates
that these guanine residues are not in their normal Watson–Crick
conformations. Furthermore, we did not detect any NOEs between G6*(NH1)
and its own amino group; these observations suggest that this imino
proton is exposed to solvent and that its resonance is broadened because
of rapid proton exchange with H2O protons. There is no
NOE cross-peak between the G16(NH1) and G18(NH1) imino protons, which
indicates that these bases are far apart, which is consistent with
the intercalation of the DB[a,l]P
ring system between these base pairs.

A NOESY (200 ms mixing
time) contour plot at 15 °C in H2O buffer is shown
in Figure C within
the imino (10.5–13.8 ppm) and amino/base H2 (5.5–8.8
ppm) NOE cross-peak region that is characteristic of well-defined
Watson–Crick base pairing. NOE cross-peaks are evident between
the narrow, upfield-shifted imino proton of dG16 (11.16 ppm) flanking
the lesion site and the two amino protons of dC7 (6.51 and 5.85 ppm).
Likewise, the similarly narrow and upfield-shifted dG18 (10.72 ppm)
imino proton flanking the lesion on the other side exhibits cross-peaks
with the 6.04 and 7.04 ppm amino protons of dC5 (Figure C, box II). These results establish Watson–Crick base
pair formation at the two base pairs flanking the lesion site. Similarly,
the thymine imino proton–H2 adenine cross-peaks establish that
Watson–Crick base pairing is maintained at all A-T base pairs
(Figure C, box I). The large upfield shifts
(&gt;1 ppm) observed for the G16(NH1) and G18(NH1) protons are attributed
to ring current shielding effects originating from the intercalation
of the DB[a,l]P moiety that is inserted
between these two adjacent base pairs (see below). The chemical shifts
of 1H nuclei in aromatic molecules are dramatically shifted
because of such aromatic ring current effects.

Nonexchangeable Proton Spectra
An
expanded NOESY spectrum
(300 ms mixing time) in D2O buffer at 20 °C, focused
on the base (purine H8 and pyrimidine H6) proton (6.45–8.45
ppm) and sugar H1′ or cytosine H5 proton (4.9–6.8 ppm)
region, is depicted in Figure . The well-resolved
DNA base and sugar protons were identified by analysis of through-space
(NOESY) connectivities and through-bond correlations in COSY and TOCSY
spectra at the same temperature. Sequential assignments between base
protons and their own and 5′-flanking sugar H1′ protons
can be traced on the modified strand for the A3-T4-C5-G6*-C7-T8-A9
segment (solid lines), except at the C5(H1′)–G6*(H8)
step indicated by an empty square (ñ). For the unmodified strand,
the sequential assignment can be traced for the entire strand with
only the disruption at the G16-G18 step. The assignments are shown
by the dashed lines in the case of the T14-G16 and G18-A19-T20 segments.
Weak cross-peaks are observed in the case of the T4(H1′)–C5(H6)
and T4(H6)–C5(H6) (labeled Ñ) connectivities. The NOE
connectivity between the adducted guanine G6* and its 5′-flanking
base C5 is missing entirely (ñ). The connectivities are also
perturbed at the (DB[a,l]P)dG6-dC7
step because the NOEs between H2′ and H2″ of dG6* and
H6 of dC7 are very weak (Figure S1 of the ). However, a weak but well-defined G6*(H1′)–C7(H6)
cross-peak is discernible (Figure S2 of the ), although NOEs between the C5(H6)–G6*(H8)
and G6*(H8)–C7(H6) protons are missing. We detected strong
NOEs between either the H5 or H6 proton of dC7 and either the sugar
H1′ or H4′ proton of dG6* in the 40 ms mixing time NOESY
spectrum (examples shown in Figure S2 of the ). These results suggest that the H5 and H6 protons
of C7 that protrude into the major groove are close to the H1′
and H4′ protons of the G6* sugar residue, as discussed previously. The results derived above, together with the
analysis of the NOESY spectrum in water, indicate that the adducted
deoxyguanosine is displaced into the major groove with the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system intercalated
between the C5:G18 and C7:G16 base pairs.

11/10-mer deletion duplex.
Expanded contour plot of a NOESY spectrum
(300 ms mixing time) recorded at 20 °C in a D2O buffer
solution. The connectivities between the base (purine H8 and pyrimidine
H6) protons (6.45–8.45 ppm) and the sugar H1′ or cytosine
H5 protons (4.9–6.8 ppm) are traced. The NOE connectivities
between the base proton and its own and 5′-flanking sugar H1′
protons from dA3 to dA9 on the modified strand are shown as solid
lines in panel A, while those from dT14 to dG16 and from dG18 to T20
on the unmodified strand are shown as dashed lines in panel B. The
cytosine H5–H6 connectivities are indicated by bullets. The
red uppercase letters indicate intermolecular NOE connectivities between
DNA and carcinogen protons, while the blue lowercase letters indicate
intramolecular carcinogen connectivities. On the modified strand,
there is a break in the sequential assignment at the C5(H1′)–G6*(H8)
cross-peak that is indicated by (ñ) and results from the displacement
to the major groove of G6*, as well as on the nonmodified strand from
G16(H1′) to G18(H1′) due to the deletion of the C17
base with intercalation of the DB[a,l]P rings between G16 and G18. Note the unusual large upfield chemical
shift of H6 of dC5 to 6.75 ppm and the downfield chemical shift of
G6*(H8) to 8.36 ppm (Table S3 of the ). The cross-peak labeled (ñ) is the C5(H1′)–G6*(H8)
cross-peak and that labeled (Ñ) the C5(H6)–T4(H6) cross-peak.
The carcinogen–carcinogen cross-peaks labeled in blue lowercase
letters are as follows: (a) DB[a,l]P(H8–H10), (b) DB[a,l]P(H8–H9),
(c) DB[a,l]P(H8–H6), (d)
DB[a,l]P(H14–H1), (e) DB[a,l]P(H14–H3), (f) DB[a,l]P(H8–H2), (g) DB[a,l]P(H7–H4), (h) DB[a,l]P(H7–H5), (i) DB[a,l]P(H7–H9),
(j) DB[a,l]P(H7–H6), (k)
DB[a,l]P(H7–H8), (l) DB[a,l]P(H11–H10), and (m) DB[a,l]P(H11–H9). The carcinogen–DNA
cross-peaks labeled in red uppercase letters are as follows: (A) C5(H6)–DB[a,l]P(H2), (B) G6*(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H1), (C) G6*(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H2), (D) DB[a,l]P(H8)–G18(H8), (E) DB[a,l]P(H8)–G16(H8), (F) DB[a,l]P(H14)–G6*(H1′), (G) DB[a,l]P(H7)–G18(H8), (H) DB[a,l]P(H7)–G16(H8), (I) C7(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H4), (J) C7(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H5), (K) C5(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H1), (L) C5(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H3), (M) C5(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H2), (N) C7(H5)–DB[a,l]P(H1), and (O) C7(H5)–DB[a,l]P(H3).

The sugar puckering and glycosidic bond conformation at the
lesion
site were probed using relative intensities in a NOESY spectrum with
a 40 ms mixing time. The glycosidic torsion angle χ is in the
normal anti conformation, which is manifested by
a weak G6*(H8)–G6*(H1′) NOE cross-peak. The NOE cross-peak between the base G6*(H8) and sugar G6*(H3′)
proton is also weak, indicative of a sugar conformation in the overall
southern/C2′-endo domain of the pseudorotation
cycle.

Chemical Shift Perturbations
The chemical shifts exhibited
by the nonexchangeable protons in the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·Del 11/10-mer
duplex relative to the same protons in an unmodified duplex are depicted
in Figure A. Compared with the corresponding
proton chemical shifts in the unmodified duplex, significant upfield
shifts for the base H5 and sugar (H2′ and H2″) protons
of dC5 are noted, while the base H8 and sugar (H1′, H2′,
H3′, and H4′) protons of dG6* are all downfield-shifted.
The H8 base protons of both G16 and G18 are upfield-shifted (Figure A). These results are consistent with ring current
effects that arise from the intercalated polycyclic aromatic ring
system with the modified dG6* base being displaced from the DNA helix.
Analogous effects were observed in the case of the stereochemically
similar 10S-B[a]P-dG 11/10-mer deletion
duplex.

Chemical shift values relative to unmodified
control duplexes.
(A) 11/10-mer deletion duplex. Chemical shift perturbations of the
nonexchangeable DNA base/sugar protons relative to the unmodified
control 11-mer duplex. The positive values of Δ ppm (δ
control – δ adduct) are upfield chemical shift resonances,
while negative values are downfield chemical shift proton resonances.
(B) 11/11-mer full duplex. Graphical representation of the chemical
shift perturbations of nonexchangeable DNA protons relative to the
unmodified control 11-mer duplex. While the points are not mathematically
related, we connect them only to facilitate comparisons.

The nonexchangeable polycyclic aromatic DB[a,l]P residue protons were assigned by
analysis of through-bond
TOCSY (an example is shown in Figure S3 of the ) and through-space NOESY connectivities.
Some of the intramolecular NOEs between protons of the polycyclic
aromatic ring system are shown in Figure A
(connectivities a–m). The chemical shifts of the aliphatic
and aromatic DB[a,l]P ring protons are listed in Table , and examples
are shown graphically in Figure S5 of the . Almost all of the DB[a,l]P residue aromatic protons are upfield-shifted
from their normal values of 8.0–8.5 ppm, which is consistent
with ring current effects due to the aromatic G16 and/or G18. With
the exception of the H4 and H5 protons of DB[a,l]P, these upfield shifts are similar to those observed
in the case of the polycyclic aromatic ring protons of the 10S-B[a]P-dG 11/10-mer deletion duplex that
are uniformly upfield-shifted. These
observations also support the intercalated conformation of the DB[a,l]P ring system.

The underlined intermolecular distances
were not used for the restrained MD simulations because of the overlap
with other cross-peaks. However, the total volumes of the overlapped
peaks were used for the Rx calculation
as unresolved peaks.

Intermolecular
NOEs
A total of 55 intermolecular NOEs
between the nonexchangeable aromatic DB[a,l]P and nearby exchangeable and nonexchangeable base and
sugar protons were identified and assigned (some are shown in Figure A) and summarized in Table . The DB[a,l]P H1, H2, H3, and
H4 protons exhibit NOEs predominantly with C5 and C7 base and sugar
protons. These NOEs indicate that the 1–2–3 edge of
the aromatic ring in the fjord region is close to the modified strand.
Furthermore, the DB[a,l]P H14 proton
exhibits NOEs with 3′-base pair C7:G16 base protons, and there
are no NOEs between H10, H11, H12, and H13 DB[a,l]P protons and DNA residues (Table ). Thus, the benzylic ring of DB[a,l]P appears to be positioned in the spacious major groove, directed
toward the 3′-side of the modified strand.

NMR-Restrained
MD Simulation Structure: Intercalative Conformation
NMR distance-restrained
MD simulations were employed to define
the solution structure of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG deletion duplex. The initial model was based
on the B-DNA NMR solution structure of the stereochemically identical
intercalated 10S-B[a]P-dG deletion
duplex, as described in . Restrained MD simulations were conducted with explicit
solvent and counterions, as detailed in  and the . Five
representative structures (Figure S4 of the ) were selected from the restrained MD simulation
using the PTRAJ module of AMBER. The best representative
structure from PTRAJ is shown in panels A and B of
Figure . The sixth-root R factor (Rx) was calculated by CORMA to evaluate the best representative structure
from the restrained MD simulation (Table ).

As shown in panels A and B of Figure ,
in the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG deletion duplex structure, the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system is intercalated between the C5:G18
and C7:G16 flanking base pairs, with the benzylic ring of the adduct
positioned in the major groove. This intercalation model is supported
by the experimentally observed upfield shifts of the aromatic DB[a,l]P protons, especially the H6, H7, H8,
and H9 protons that are significantly upfield shifted (Figure S5 of
the ), and the close
contact of this group of protons with the H8 base and sugar protons
of G16 and G18. As mentioned earlier, these upfield shifts are attributed
to ring current effects due to stacking of G16 and G18 with the DB[a,l]P ring system and are consistent with
the intercalation of the 6–7–8–9 edge (Figure A) of the carcinogen aromatic ring system between
G16 and G18.

The modified unpartnered guanine G6*, linked to
the DB[a,l]P ring system, is displaced
into the
major groove. In the model, one face of G6* is exposed to the solvent.
The displacement of G6* with solvent exposure is consistent with the
absence of the G6* imino proton resonance in the 1D exchangeable proton
spectrum, and the absence of NOE cross-peaks between the G6* imino
proton and its own amino with imino protons of flanking bases. The
major groove positioning of the G6* residue is also supported by NOEs
between C7(H6) and G6*(H4′) and between C7(H5) and G6*(H1′)
at a 40 ms NOE mixing time (Figure S2 of the ), because H6 and H5 of C7 are positioned in the
major groove. The base major groove edge and sugar ring of dC5 are
stacked over the displaced guanine (Figure A,B), as shown by downfield shifts of the dG6* base protons and upfield
shifts of dC5 protons and correlated shifts of some of the sugar protons
of both nucleotides (Figure A and Table S3
of the ).

The
covalent linkage bond torsion angles α′ and β′
(Figure A) and the glycosidic torsion angle
χ in our model have average values of 144 ± 4°, 285
± 3°, and 253 ± 7°, respectively. The glycosidic
torsion is in the anti domain, as shown by a weak
G6*(H8)–G6*(H1′) NOE cross-peak. In the model, the fjord region deviates from planarity
with the dihedral angle δ′ (C15–C17–C20–C1)
(Figure A) having an average value of 16 ±
1°. This twist of the fjord ring optimizes stacking between the
DB[a,l]P aromatic rings and the
flanking base pairs. The sugar pucker in the distance-refined structure
at G6* is C1′-exo – C2′-endo (pseudorotation parameter P ∼
125), consistent with the weak NOE between
G6*(H8) and G6*(H3′) that is characteristic
of the overall C2′-endo (southern) conformational
region of the pseudorotation cycle.

The base pairs flanking the lesion, C5:G18 and C7:G16, retain Watson–Crick
hydrogen bonding, as shown by NOEs between the guanine imino protons
and their partner cytosine amino protons. These two pairs stack well
with the DB[a,l]P aromatic rings,
and the existence of stacking interactions is supported by the unusual
upfield shifts of the C5:G18 and C7:G16 base pair imino protons (Figure A). The distance between G16(H1′) and G18(H8)
averages 7.2 ± 0.2 Å, consistent with the lack of connectivity
at the G16-G18 step in the NOESY spectrum (Figure B), and reflects the backbone stretch induced by intercalation
of the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system.
The other base pairs, except for one base pair at each end, retain
normal Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding, as supported by NOEs
between imino and amino protons (Figure C).

NMR Characterization of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·dC Full Duplex
Exchangeable Proton Spectra
The 1D exchangeable proton
spectrum (10.8–13.8 ppm) of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG 11/11-mer duplex in H2O buffer (pH 6.8), recorded at 500 MHz and 10 °C, is shown in
Figure A. The assignments of the imino proton
resonances are shown, and the values are summarized in Table S4 of
the . The 1D spectrum
exhibits two broad and upfield-shifted resonances that are identified
as the G18 and G6* imino protons (11.88 and 11.12 ppm, respectively).
In contrast to that of G18, the G16 imino proton resonance (12.36
ppm) is relatively sharp. The unusual widths of the G18 and G6* resonances
indicate that these imino protons are undergoing rapid exchange with
water. Also, the imino proton resonance
of T4 is broader than those of other thymines and also exhibits a
noticeable shoulder (Figure A and Figure S6
of the ). The broadness
of the T4 imino proton resonance is likely due to a greater than normal
solvent exposure, and the shoulder is suggestive of conformational
flexibility. By contrast, the G16 imino proton resonance is very sharp,
indicating that there is no abnormal solvent exchange. Overall, the
severe distortions at the G6*:C17 and C5:G18 base pairs continue more
modestly up to the T4:A19 base pair, which is consistent with a 5′-orientation
of the bulky DB[a,l]P aromatic ring
system.

NMR characteristics of 11/11-mer duplexes in H2O. (A)
1D spectrum (10.8–13.8 ppm) of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·dC adduct recorded at 10
°C in a 500 MHz spectrometer in a buffer solution (pH 6.8). (B)
2D symmetric imino–imino proton region (10.8–13.8 ppm)
of a NOESY spectrum at a 175 ms mixing time at 10 °C showing
the sequential assignment of the five central bases. The sequential
assignment is broken at the T4(NH3)–C18(NH1) cross-peak and
at the C18(NH1)–G6*(NH1) cross-peak, as indicated by the empty
squares. (C) Portion of a 2D NOESY (175 ms mixing time) contour plot
recorded at 500 MHz and 10 °C in a water solution showing NOE
connectivities between imino (12.0–13.8 ppm) and amino/base
(6.2–8.8 ppm) protons. Region I shows characteristic signs
of the Watson–Crick hydrogen-bonded thymine imino–adenine
H2 proton cross-peak across the duplex. Region II shows characteristic
signs of the Watson–Crick hydrogen-bonded guanine imino–cytosine
amino proton cross-peak across the two strands. G16(NH1)–C7(NH2)
cross-peaks are labeled A, and the G16(NH1)–A15(H2) NOE is
labeled A′. At a 4× intensity contour level increment,
it is possible to observe two NOE cross-peaks between G16(NH1) and
carcinogen protons H13 and H11. There is no evidence of Watson–Crick
hydrogen bonding in the case of the putative G6*:C17 and C5:C18 base
pairs.

A portion of an NOE contour plot
(175 ms mixing time) at 10 °C
focused on the symmetrical 10.8–13.8 ppm region is shown in
Figure B. The sequential imino–imino
proton connectivities, or lack thereof, are shown by arrows for the
9 bp starting from G21 and going to G12. The G6* imino proton is identified
by a weak cross-peak to the G16(NH1) proton. The positions of missing
cross-peaks between T4(NH1) and G18(NH1) and between G18(NH1) and
G6*(NH1) are indicated by empty squares. Increasing the contour plot
level does not reveal any cross-peaks in the positions indicated by
the squares. These results indicate that the canonical DNA structure
is perturbed at the G18 base on the 5′-side of the lesion site
and at the adducted base G6*.

Figure C shows a portion of an NOE (175
ms mixing time) contour plot at 10 °C in H2O buffer;
characteristic cross-peaks between imino (12.2–13.8 ppm) protons
and amino and base H2 (6.2–8.7 ppm) protons of the well-defined
Watson–Crick base pairs are observed on the 3′-side
of the adduct. In region I, cross-peaks are observed among all four
A:T base pairs, but the intensities of the cross-peaks between the
T8:A15 and T4:A19 base pairs are weaker then the NOEs between the
T14:A9 and T20:A3 base pairs. Both base pairs are more distant from
the site of the adduct at G6*, and these results indicate that the
structural perturbation due to the adduct extends 1 bp beyond the
G16:C7 and G18:C5 base pairs adjacent to the adduct. In box II, cross-peaks
labeled A1 and A2 indicate Watson–Crick base pairing between
the G16(NH1) and C7(NH1) and C7(NH2) protons, respectively. A weak
cross-peak between the G16(NH1) imino and A15(H2) base protons is
also observed (A′). By magnifying the contour plot 4-fold (4×),
we were able to observe two cross-peaks, between the G16 imino proton
and DB[a,l]P residue aliphatic protons
H13 and H11. A further increase in the contour plot level did not
reveal the existence of any additional cross-peaks that could have
been attributable to G18:C5 or G6*:C17 Watson–Crick base pairing.
Moreover, there is no indication of any cross-peak between DB[a,l]P protons and the partially solvent-exposed
G18 or G6* imino protons. The other NOEs in region I involve guanines
G21 and G13 that are distant from the site of the adduct but are consistent
with normal base pairing.

The temperature dependence of the
imino proton spectrum is shown
in Figure S6 of the . The imino proton assignments shown in the 10 °C spectrum can
be easily extrapolated to other temperatures. The behavior of the
T4, G18, and G6* imino protons is particularly striking. At 0 °C,
the T4 imino proton resonance is relatively sharp, but as the temperature
is increased, it broadens and almost vanishes at 35 °C. On the
other hand, the G18 and G6* imino proton resonances are not discernible
at 0 °C, but they become visible because some narrowing becomes
evident at the higher temperatures of 10 and 25 °C; however,
they start to disappear as the temperature is increased further to
35 °C. By contrast, the G16(NH1) and other imino proton resonances
remain rather sharp throughout the temperature range of 10–35
°C.

These results suggest that at 0 °C the lesion
site, especially
the G6*:C17 and G18*:C5 base pair imino proton resonances are broadened
due to exchange mechanisms and conformational heterogeneity at the
lower temperatures (Figure C). By contrast,
the G16:C7 and T4:A19 base pairs appear to be normal at 0 °C.
When the temperature is increased to 25 °C and even 35 °C,
the conformational flexibility of the bases in the fluid state indicates
some degree of episodic weak hydrogen bonding at the G6*:C17 and G18:C5
base pairs, as manifested by the weak and broadened imino proton resonances
that are observed at these temperatures, while hydrogen bonding at
the G16:C7 base pair remains sharp and intact (Figure S6 of the ). By contrast, while the
hydrogen bonding at the T4:A19 base pair is prominent at 10 °C,
the T4 imino proton resonance broadens and its intensity diminishes
as the temperature is further increased to 25 and 35 °C (Figure
S6 of the ), indicating
diminished Watson–Crick hydrogen bonding and local melting
of the duplex at the T4:A19 base pair, as well as at the G18:C5 and
G6*:C17 base pairs. In summary, these observations indicate that the
adduct distorts the helix on the 5′-side of G6*, that this
disturbance extends over 2 bp, and that the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system is therefore positioned on the
5′-side of G6*.

Nonexchangeable Proton Spectra
The
expanded NOESY spectrum
(200 ms mixing time, 600 MHz) in D2O buffer at 11 °C
focused on the base (6.7–8.4 ppm) and base H5 and sugar H1′
proton (4.35–6.3 ppm) region is depicted in Figure . The sequential assignment between base protons
to their own and 5′-flanking sugar H1′ protons on the
modified strand can be traced within the A3-T4-C5-G6*-C7-T8-A9 segment
(solid lines) with a break between G6* and C7 (box ñ, Figure , top panel). The A3(H1′)–T4(H6) cross-peak
is normal, indicating that T4 is in its proper Watson–Crick
position at this temperature (11 °C). The T4(H1′)–C5(H6)
cross-peak overlaps with the cross-peak between C5(H1′) and
C5(H6); the C5(H1′)–G6*(H8) cross-peak is very weak
and can be observed only if the contour diagram is cut lower by a
factor of ∼2 (cross-peak A, shown in the bottom panel). The
G6*(H1′)–C7(H6) cross-peak is very clearly defined,
and its intensity is normal. However, the C7(H1′)–C7(H6)
cross-peak overlaps partially with the C5(H1′)–C5(H6)
cross-peak, and the C7(H1′)–T8(H6) cross-peak overlaps
partially with the T8(H6)–T8(H1′) cross-peak.

NMR characteristics
of 11/11-mer duplexes in D2O. Expanded
contour plot of a NOESY spectrum (200 ms mixing time) recorded at
11 °C focused on the base (purine H8 and pyrimidine H6) and base
(pyrimidine H5) and sugar H1′ proton region. The NOEs between
the 2.45 Å fixed distance for the cytosine H5 to H6 are designated
by diamonds. Sequential assignment for the segment formed by bases
from A3 to A9 is indicated by the solid lines without disruption in
the modified strand, although some cross-peaks are very weak (cross-peak
A; see the bottom panel). For the nonmodified strand, the sequential
assignment for the T14-A15-G16-C17-G18-A19-T20-G21-G22 segment (dashed
lines) cannot be followed entirely. A disruption is observed from
C17 to T20; elsewhere, the NOE connectivities can be traced without
further interruption. The bottom panel shows a portion of the top
panel contour plot level at 2× intensity revealing some weak
cross-peaks labeled from A to G: (A) C5(H1′)–G6*(H8),
(B) G6*(H8)–G6*(H1′), (C) T4(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H4), (D) G6*(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H1), (E) T20(H8)–A19(H1′),
(F) A19(H8)–A19(H1′), and (G) C5(H1′)–DB[a,l]P(H3).

In the case of the unmodified strand, the sequential assignment
between base protons to their own and 5′-flanking sugar H1′
protons for the T14-A15-G16-C17-G18-A19-T20 segment cannot be followed
entirely (dashed lines, Figure , top and bottom
panels). For example, a normal NOE is observed between A15(H1′)
and G16(H8); however, the G16(H8)–G16(H1′) NOE is weak,
and a very weak G16(H1′)–C17(H6) NOE can be observed.
However, the C17(H6)–(H1′) NOE could not be identified.
No other connectivities to C17(H6) are evident, and the NOEs connecting
the C17-G18-A19-T20 segment are missing. However, the NOE connectivities
can be traced from T20 to the terminal base G22 in the unmodified
strand. With a 2-fold increase in the contour level (2× intensity,
Figure , bottom panel), several cross-peaks
labeled A–G become observable. The NOEs labeled C, D, and G
are DNA–carcinogen cross-peaks. Peaks A and B are between G6*(H8)
and C5 (H1′) and G6*(H1′), respectively. Peak E represents
cross-peaks between A19(H1′) and T20(H6). Peak F represents
a missing cross-peak between A19(H1′) and A19(H8). The G6*
and A19 base protons, which overlap at 11 °C, were distinguishable
in the NOESY (250 ms mixing time) spectrum at 25 °C (Figure S7
of the ). We estimate
the chemical shift value for the A19 base proton through a cross-peak
observed between the methyl group of T20 and the base proton of A19
(Figure S7 of the ). Because it was not possible to determine the sequential assignments
for the C17-G18-A19-T20 segment of the unmodified strand, the position
of the G18(H8) proton resonance could not be assigned. In summary,
the perturbed C17-G18-A19 segment is consistent with the position
of the DB[a,l]P residue on the 5′-side
of G6*, the modified base.

Chemical Shifts
The chemical shift
perturbations of
the DNA nonexchangeable protons of the major conformer relative to
its unmodified control duplex are depicted in Figure B. It was not possible to accurately assign some of the deoxyribose
protons because of the significant distortion of the DNA structure
caused by the DB[a,l]P residue.
Nevertheless, some additional useful insights into the overall conformational
features of this adduct can be gleaned from the changes in chemical
shifts exhibited by the H1′, H2′, and H4′ deoxyribose
protons and the H6/H8 base protons (Figure B). Upfield or downfield chemical shifts of sugar proton resonances
can be observed from the T4 to C7 residues on the modified strand,
and from the G16 to A19 residues on the complementary strand. Interesting
differences are evident between the chemical shifts observed in the
case of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·Del (Figure A) and DB[a,l]P-dG full 11-mer duplexes (Figure B). For example, in the case of the Del duplex,
the H2″ proton of C5 is upfield-shifted, while in the full
duplex, it is downfield-shifted, pointing to differences in the orientation
of the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring systems
in these different duplexes. In the case of the unmodified strand,
the perturbations in chemical shifts occur mainly in the G16-G18 region;
in the full duplex, the disturbance extends from the beginning to
the end of the A15-G16-C17-G18-A19 segment. This is also consistent
with an orientation of the DB[a,l]P ring system that is external to the helix and extends to base
A19 of the unmodified strand. Taken together, the data suggest that
the DB[a,l]P aromatic rings in the
dominant conformation are located in the minor groove pointing toward
the 5′-side of the lesion, although not in a classical minor
groove conformation with all Watson–Crick base pairing maintained
as in the case of the stereochemically analogous B[a]P-N2-dG adduct in the same sequence
context.,

NMR Assignment of the DB[a,l]P Proton Resonances
The nonexchangeable
carcinogen protons
were assigned from the analysis of through-bond TOCSY and through-space
NOESY connectivities. The chemical shifts
at 11 °C of the aliphatic and aromatic DB[a,l]P ring protons are listed in Table  and graphically presented in Figure S5 of the .

Experimentally
observed NOEs were
employed as restraint bounds in the distance-restrained MD simulation.
The following bounds were assigned on the basis of the observed intensities:
[M] = 3.5–4.5 Å, [W] = 4.5–6.0 Å, [M–W]
= 3.5–6.0 Å. M for medium and W for weak.

Intermolecular NOEs
A total of 16 intermolecular NOEs
were identified and assigned between the nonexchangeable DB[a,l]P protons and the exchangeable and
nonexchangeable DNA protons. These intermolecular NOEs were classified
as strong, medium, medium-weak, and weak according to the number of
contour lines at the same threshold (Table ). Most of the intermolecular NOEs observed involve protons on the
DB[a,l]P residue and the modified
DNA strand. The presence of the NOE between DB[a,l]P(H4) and T4(H1′) indicates that the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system extends up to
T4, which is also consistent with a minor groove location. The 5′-orientation
of the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system
is further supported by the 2D imino proton spectrum in H2O (Figure A), which clearly demonstrates
that the G6*:C17 and C5:G18 base pairs are mainly disrupted, while
the 1D spectra in Figure S6 of the  indicate that the T4:A19 base pair is also destabilized.
Consistent with this orientation, the aliphatic ring system protons
of the DB[a,l]P residue exhibit
NOEs with protons of the C7:G16 base pair (Table ).

Distance-Restrained MD Model
Many
of the structural
details of the minor groove 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct in the full duplex remain poorly
defined because of overlapping and/or missing NOE connectivities,
indicating significant conformational flexibility and/or broadening
of some of the important resonances in the vicinity of the DB[a,l]P residue. However, the available DB[a,l]P residue–DNA connectivities
yield a number of distance restraints that allowed for the modeling
of this minor groove structure by MD simulation methods.

Distance-restrained
MD simulations were conducted for a 5′-directed minor groove
conformation utilizing the restraints listed in Table . The initial model was created on the basis of the B[a]P-dG minor groove NMR solution structure and subjected to restrained MD as detailed in . Because of the conformational heterogeneity,
weak NOEs, and unidentified cross-peaks, it was not possible to conduct
intensity refinements.

The distance-refined model of the major
conformation of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct in
the full duplex is shown in Figure C, while
Table  shows that the achieved distances are
within the range of the target values. While the bulky DB[a,l]P moiety with its five aromatic rings
resides in the B-DNA minor groove and points toward the 5′-direction
of the modified strand like the analogous B[a]P moiety,
its accommodation in this groove is very different. Instead of fitting
into the contours of the minor groove without excessive distortions,
the DB[a,l]P ring system causes
a marked enlargement and widening of the groove mainly on the 5′-side
of G6* (Figures S8 and S9 of the ); one face of the DB[a,l]P ring
system is in close contact with the opened minor groove, with its
large surface area achieving strong van der Waals interactions with
the minor groove wall, while the other face is exposed to solvent
(Figure S8 of the ). The Watson–Crick hydrogen bond at the lesion-modified base
pair (G6*:C17) and the 5′-flanking base pair (C5:G18) is ruptured,
and the T4:A19 base pair is disrupted in 31% of the ensemble population
(Table S5 of the ). C17 stacks with the DB[a,l]P
aromatic ring system, which is consistent with the upfield shift of
the C17 protons. Furthermore, the duplex is also significantly unwound
and untwisted at the G6*:C17 to C7:G16 adduct binding site, and this
untwisting is compensated by overtwisting at the adjacent C7:G16 to
T8:A15 step (Figure S9 of the ).

Discussion
The results of this study
show that the size and shape of the aromatic
ring system can give rise not only to pronounced differences in the
conformations of the PAH diol epoxide DNA adducts formed but also
to different extents of distortion of the surrounding DNA structure.
Key features are the size of the aromatic ring system, its topology,
the base sequence context, and the lesion stereochemistry. Here we
compare the structure of the fjord 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct with that of the topologically
similar but smaller 1S-B[c]Ph-dG
adduct, and that of the topologically different and configurationally
identical 10S-B[a]P-dG adduct (Figure A). We also compare the structures of the 14S- and 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG adducts. Finally, we consider how the structural
features of the lesions provide insights into their relative susceptibilities
to excision by the human NER system.

Minor Groove and Intercalation
Structures in Full Duplexes:
Effects of PAH Adduct Topology
The stereochemically similar
and planar four-ring bay region 10S-B[a]P-dG·dC adduct (Figure S10 of
the ) shares features
with the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG·dC adduct in full 11/11-mer duplexes with identical sequence
contexts. However, there are very significant differences due to the
additional DB[a,l]P aromatic ring
in the fjord region (Figure A). These two
adducts share the same minor groove structures with the bulky aromatic
ring systems being oriented on the 5′-side of the modified
guanine residue (G6*). In each adduct, one face of the polycyclic
aromatic ring system is exposed to the solvent while the other side
is in van der Waals contact with the groove walls. In the case of
the B[a]P-dG adduct, all Watson–Crick base
pairs are maintained in the full duplex and there is no evidence of
any severe structural distortions of the duplex, although the minor
groove is somewhat widened. In the case
of the DB[a,l]P-dG adduct, the wider
aromatic ring system with the additional nonplanar aromatic ring in
the fjord region causes a much greater opening of the minor groove,
and the aromatic rings contact the minor groove face-on. By contrast,
the aromatic ring system is inserted edge-on into the minor groove
in the case of the B[a]P-dG·dC adduct (Figure
S10 of the )., Moreover, C17, the partner base of G6*, stacks with the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system as manifested
by the upfield shift of the C17(H6) base proton. This stacking partly
shields one face of the DB[a,l]P
aromatic ring from the solvent (Figure C and
Figure S8 of the ).

In the case of the B[a]P-dG adduct, all
of the base pairs, including the modified G6*:C17 base pair, are intact;
however, in the case of the DB[a,l]P-dG adduct full duplex, the G18:C5 and G6*:C17 base pairs and,
to a lesser extent, the T4:A19 pair are destabilized (Figure C). The destabilization of base pairs is supported
by the absence of imino to amino cross-peaks between the C5:G18 and
G6*:C17 base pairs. However, some evidence of episodic or weak hydrogen
bonding is evident from the presence of weak and broadened imino proton
resonances of G18 and G6* (Figure S6 of the ). We speculate that conformational flexibility
might allow the DB[a,l]P rings to
infrequently assume a conformation more like that of the bay region
B[a]P adduct with its aromatic ring edges pointing
into the groove and all Watson–Crick base pairs maintained
and distinguishable.

The much smaller three-ring fjord region
1S-B[c]Ph-dG adduct lacks the two
5,6,7,8,9 aromatic rings of
the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG
adduct (Figure A), is smaller by one aromatic
ring, and has an aromatic ring topology different from that of the
bay region 10S-B[a]P-dG adduct.
Because all three adducts have identical stereochemical properties,
they offer the opportunity to evaluate the effects of other structural
variables such as the topology and size of the aromatic ring systems
on DNA adduct conformations and, ultimately, their biological responses.

In the case of the full duplexes with the identical sequence shown
in Figure , only the 1S-B[c]Ph-dG·dC adduct assumes an intercalated conformation
with the aromatic B[c]Ph residue inserted between
the G18:C5 and G6*:C17 base pairs flanking the modified base pair
on the 5′-side. The Watson–Crick
base pairing, though distorted, is maintained at the 1S-B[c]Ph-dG adduct site and beyond (Figure S10 of
the ). The energetic considerations that come into
play in determining whether a polycyclic aromatic ring system resides
in a groove or is intercalated are multifaceted in nature: intercalation
is favored by withdrawal of the aromatic rings from the aqueous solvent
and stacking interactions with the DNA bases. The minor groove conformation
in the case of the B[a]P-dG adduct has the advantage
of retaining Watson–Crick pairing and normal base stacking
interactions, with minimal distortions of the normal B-DNA structure., However, the minor groove conformation of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct has two or
three destabilized base pairs, severe distortions in the minor groove
dimensions, and significant solvent exposure of the large aromatic
ring system. The question of why the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct adopts this unfavorable
minor groove conformation rather than an intercalated one like that
of the 1S-B[c]Ph-dG adduct arises.
A logical possibility is that the distorting penalty of intercalation
is even greater than the distorting penalty of this minor groove structure.
To examine this possibility, we created an intercalated model of the
14S-DB[a,l]P-dG
adduct (Figure S11 of the ) based on the 1S-B[c]Ph-dG NMR
structure with intact Watson–Crick pairs (Figure S10 of the ) and compared these two structures. An analysis presented in the  indicates that the intercalation
structure would have destabilizing properties stemming from the positioning
of the diol epoxide ring in the DNA minor groove that would disfavor
intercalation.

Comparison of the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG Deletion Duplex with the 10S-B[a]P-dG Deletion Duplex
Both
the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG
and 10S-B[a]P-dG adducts adopt intercalated
conformations
in deletion duplexes. Although the partner nucleotide opposite the
G6* adduct is absent, the backbone is stretched so that the adjacent
Watson–Crick base pairs are maintained. The aromatic rings
stack with the flanking C5:G18 and C7:G16 base pairs, while the benzylic
rings with the attached guanine are positioned in the more wide and
spacious major groove. However, the orientations of the adducts are
different. In the 10S-B[a]P-dG·Del
adduct (Figure S10 of the ), the long axis of the B[a]P ring system is perpendicular
to the long axis of the flanking base pairs; as a result, the benzylic
ring is on the major groove side, the distal aromatic rings protrude
into the minor groove, and the aromatic ring system is not in immediate
contact with the unmodified partner strand. By contrast, in the DB[a,l]P adduct, the additional 1,2,3,4 DB[a,l]P ring is close to the modified strand
and the aromatic ring system is shifted toward the partner strand
(Figure A,B). With the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system near the partner strand,
the intercalation pocket is close to uniform in rise, while the pocket
is wedge-shaped in the case of the polycyclic aromatic residue 10S-B[a]P-dG·Del adduct (Figure S10
of the ). Factors
that stabilize an intercalative rather than a minor groove conformation
in the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG deletion duplex are considered in the .

Comparison of 14S- and 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG Full Duplexes
While the 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct in the full duplex is situated in the minor groove and
is highly flexible and distorting, the 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct adopts a stable conformation
with intercalation from the narrow minor groove on the 3′-side
of the damaged guanine. Hydrogen bonding with the partner cytosine
is lost as the base pair is stretched due to the intercalation of
the bulky ring system; this results in weakened stacking of the adjacent
base pairs with the DB[a,l]P aromatic
rings. Severe opening of the major and
minor grooves accompanies this stretching. This striking stereoisomer-dependent
structural difference is a manifestation of the “S” effect in PAH-derived stereoisomeric DNA adducts, which characterizes the steric effects that
cause greater conformational flexibility in adducts with S than with R stereochemistry at the linkage site.
Other factors that may determine the minor groove versus intercalative
positioning in the S versus R DB[a,l]P-dG stereoisomeric adducts are considered
in the .

Relationship
to Nucleotide Excision Repair
We have
recently shown that the minor groove-positioned 14S-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct in double-stranded DNA is
modestly repaired as compared
to the well-repaired 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct in HeLa cell extracts. The NER efficiency of this 14S adduct
is similar to that of the 10S- and 10R-B[a]P-dG adducts,, which are
positioned in minimally disturbed minor grooves pointing in the 5′-
and 3′-directions relative to the modified guanines, respectively. We attribute the smaller NER activity of the
14S-DB[a,l]P-dG
adduct relative to that of the 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct to the extensive van der Waals interactions
between the DB[a,l]P aromatic rings
and DNA residues in the minor groove, as well as to the stacking interactions
of the DB[a,l]P aromatic ring system
with the C17 base in the 14S case (Figure C). On the other hand, the intercalative insertion
of the large DB[a,l]P aromatic ring
on the 3′-side of G6* in the 14R-DB[a,l]P-dG adduct and the protrusion of the
bulky benzylic ring into the crowded minor groove disrupt the hydrogen bonding of the modified G6*:C17 base
pair, cause a local widening of the major and minor grooves, and diminish
the level of stacking between the DB[a,l]P aromatic rings and adjacent base pairs. Thus, the 14R adduct is more significantly destabilized than the minor groove
14S-DB[a,l]P-dG
adduct whose distortions are partly compensated by the strong van
der Waals interactions. The greater instability in the 14R case, manifested also in thermal melting data, is correlated with
a higher NER activity of the 14R adduct versus that
of the 14S adduct.

The crystal structure of Rad4/Rad23, the yeast homologue of the human
NER recognition factor XPC-RAD23B with a DNA duplex containing a thymine
dimer lesion, shows that two bases opposite the lesion are flipped
out of the helix and are bound to the protein, while its BHD3 β-hairpin
is inserted between the two DNA strands. We have hypothesized that the van der Waals interactions between
the adducts and local DNA residues could inhibit the productive hairpin
intrusion. Thus the recognition step
and the ease of local separation of the two strands in the vicinity
of the DNA lesion play a role in the NER activity. In turn, the ease
of strand separation associated with the presence of an adducted base
would be related to the extent of local thermodynamic destabilization
of the DNA duplex,, which is determined by the balance
between destabilizing and stabilizing interactions produced by the
adduct.
