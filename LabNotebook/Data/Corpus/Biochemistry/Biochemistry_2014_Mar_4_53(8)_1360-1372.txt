Despite the
decline of cancer-related
mortality in the past decade, effective approaches to early diagnosis
and treatment of pancreatic cancer remain elusive. Although it accounts
for only 3% (43000 new cases every year) of all cancers, pancreatic
cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States
(37000 deaths annually) and has the highest mortality rate of any
cancer., Those with an operable early stage of the
disease have a 5 year survival rate of ∼20%., Unfortunately,
80% of all pancreatic cancer diagnoses indicate an advanced stage
of the disease that is beyond the point of surgery.,, Inoperable forms of pancreatic cancer have
a 5 year survival rate of only 3%. The difficulty in detecting or
diagnosing pancreatic cancer has several causes: the early stages
of pancreatic cancer do not typically exhibit symptoms; the symptoms
that do occur are often similar to those of other illnesses; and the
location of the pancreas behind other organs can hinder detection.

Most patients with advanced pancreatic
cancer are treated with
chemotherapy based on gemcitabine, which is a cytotoxic nucleoside
drug that primarily inhibits DNA synthesis. However, this treatment is only mildly effective for patients with
an advanced stage of pancreatic cancer and provides an only 5.91 month
increase in the median survival rate. Also,
gemcitabine-resistant forms of pancreatic cancer and acquired resistance
during treatment are common problems. Correspondingly,
there have been numerous attempts to combine gemcitabine with other
cytotoxic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine. However,
these approaches have been mostly unsuccessful. It is apparent that a cytotoxic approach to treating pancreatic
cancer is not an effective therapy. Therefore, identifying novel,
but druggable, protein targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer
and improving the quality of life for patients are essential needs.

The DnaJ proteins, also known as heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40 or
Hsc40), are proteins originally identified in Escherichia
coli that act as cochaperones to the molecular chaperone
DnaK (Hsp70), which is responsible for several cellular processes
such as rescuing misfolded proteins, folding polypeptide chains, transport
of polypeptides through membranes, assembly and disassembly of protein
complexes, and control of regulatory proteins.− DnaJ primarily
facilitates the hydrolysis of ATP from DnaK that is necessary for
the chaperone activity of DnaK.− In general, J-domain proteins
modulate protein assembly, disassembly, and translocation.

Human protein DnaJ subfamily A member
1 (DNAJA1) has been shown
to associate on its own with unfolded polypeptide chains and prevent
their aggregation, to regulate androgen
receptor signaling and spermatogenosis in mice, and to contribute to the resistance of glioblastomas to
radiotherapy. DNAJA1 has also been targeted
as a biomarker for pancreatic cancer to evaluate the effects of farnesyl
protein transferase inhibitors, and has been shown
to be downregulated 5-fold in a genomics analysis of pancreatic cancer
cells relative to normal healthy cells and cells undergoing pancreatitis. Additionally, DNAJA1 appears to be involved
in importing proteins into the mitochondria., Of note, the mitochondrial pathway to apoptosis protects against
cancer and requires importing apoptotic factors into the mitochondrial
membrane.− Additionally, DNAJA1 is an interesting target based on its association
with DnaK, which is expressed abundantly in various tumors and can
potentially promote tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell death.− However, there have been no studies of whether the conserved J-domain
of DnaJ alone has any role in cancer biology independent of DnaK.

Thus, DNAJA1 was selected for further
analysis as a potentially
interesting therapeutic target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
The potential importance of DNAJA1 to pancreatic cancer was demonstrated
by stress response cell-based assays using cell lines overexpressing
DNAJA1. DNAJA1 was shown to regulate the hyperphosphorylation of c-Jun
and cell survivability under stress. The resulting nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) structure of the J-domain of DNAJA1 (DNAJA1-JD) combined
with a detailed bioinformatics analysis predicted the location of
overlapping activating and inhibitory protein binding sites. A subsequent
NMR–ligand affinity screen provided further experimental support
for the existence of the predicted inhibitory protein binding sites
and also demonstrated that the J-domain of DNAJA1 is a potential druggable
target. In total, our results suggest DNAJA1 activity is highly regulated
and that DNAJA1 is involved in a stress response signaling pathway
that suppresses the anti-apoptosis state found in pancreatic cancer
cells.

Experimental Procedures
Effect of DNAJA1 Overexpression on Cellular
Stress Modulation
in Pancreatic Cancer Cells
MiaPaCa2 cells were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured
as previously described. Briefly, MiaPaCa2
cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate,
and penicillin/streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. To stably express the full-length His-tagged DNAJA1 construct,
retroviral transductions were conducted essentially as described previously. The DNAJA1 construct was purchased from the
Arizona State University Biodesign Institute (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.jsp).

Cell lysates were prepared by scraping cells (80–90%
confluent) into lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl,
1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS,
5 mM EDTA, and 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride]. Lysates were
incubated, on ice, for 30 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 15
min at 13000 rpm to remove cell debris. Supernatants were transferred
to fresh tubes, and the protein content was determined using the Bradford
protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with various concentrations
of bovine serum albumin as standards. Cell lysates were stored at
−20 or −80 °C. Cell lysate proteins were resolved
on 10 or 12% Tris-glycine denaturing polyacrylamide gels in 1×
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
buffer (1 g/L SDS, 3 g/L Tris base, and 14.4 g/L glycine). Western
blotting was performed as previously described., The membranes were probed with primary antibodies against phosphoS63-c-Jun
[2361 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA)], total c-Jun [9165
(Cell Signaling Technology)], the His tag [2365 (Cell Signaling Technology)],
and tubulin [E7 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City,
IA)]. The primary antibody treatments were performed overnight at
4 °C at 1:1000 dilutions.

Cell survival was evaluated by
the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] assay as described elsewhere. Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of
5000 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C. Twelve hours later, cells
were treated with anisomysin (10 μg/mL) or solvent control [dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)] and incubated for 24 h. At the end point, the culture
medium was removed and 20 μL of the MTT solution [5 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO)] was added per well, followed by a 2 h incubation.
MTT was removed, and 200 μL of DMSO was added to each well to
dissolve formazan. The formazan optical density was determined by
utilizing a microplate reader (FLUOstar Omega, BMG LABTECH, Cary,
NC) at a wavelength of 540 nm.

Solution Structure of the
DNAJA1 J-Domain
The full-length
human DNAJA1 protein (397 amino acids) has been targeted by the Northeast
Structural Genomics Consortium [NESG (http://www.nesg.org)] for structural elucidation as target HR3099 (UniProt entry P31689)
(Figure ).

Protein sequence of DNAJA1 (UniProt entry
P31689). The red residues
are the 67 amino acids of the J-domain (DNAJA1-JD).

Samples of approximately 100% 15N-enriched,
5% 13C-enriched, and uniformly 13C- and 15N-enriched DNAJA1-JD [77 amino acids with 10 non-native residues,
MGHHHHHHSH, at the N-terminus
for purification (NESG entry HR3099K)] were produced using the standard
protocols of the NESG., The protein construct containing
the sequence for DNAJA1-JD was transformed into BL21(DE3)+Magic cells.
The soluble fraction of the lysed cells was collected and purified
with a Ni+ affinity column (HisTrap HP 5 mL column, GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) and a gel filtration column (HiLoad 26/60
Superdex 75 prep grade, GE Healthcare). The sample identity and isotopic
enrichment were validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the homogeneity (&gt;97%) was
assessed
by SDS–PAGE. The NMR protein sample was stored in a sealed
Shigemi tube with 20 mM 2-(4-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid [MES (Sigma-Aldrich)]
buffer [pH 6.5 (uncorrected)] with 10% D2O (Sigma-Aldrich),
0.02% NaN3 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 mM dithiothreitol [DTT (Sigma-Aldrich)],
5 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich),
and 50 μM 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid [DSS (Sigma-Aldrich)].

NMR experiments used for the protein backbone and side-chain assignments
of DNAJA1-JD were collected at 298 K on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer
equipped with a 5 mm TXI probe. The backbone and side-chain assignments
were completed using the standard triple-resonance approach− of the following NMR experiments: two-dimensional (2D) 1H–15N HSQC, 2D 1H–13C HSQC, and three-dimensional (3D) HNCO; HN(CA)CO; HNCA; HN(CO)CA;
CBCA(CO)NH; CBCANH; HNHA; HBHA(CO)NH; CC(CO)NH; HCC(CO)NH; HCCH-COSY;
and HCCH-TOCSY. 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments (mixing times of 120 ms) were conducted
on a 500 MHz Bruker Avance DRX spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance, Z-axis gradient cryoprobe to identify nuclear Overhauser
effects (NOEs). Amide hydrogen exchange rates were also evaluated
on the 500 MHz Bruker Avance DRX spectrometer using the (CLEANEX-PM)-FHSQC
experiment.

The NMR experimental data were processed using NMRPipe and evaluated in CCPNMR Analysis (http://www.ccpn.ac.uk). An initial model of DNAJA1-JD was
generated from the protein backbone resonances using CS-ROSETTA on
the WeNMR GRID-enabled web portal (http://www.enmr.eu/webportal).−

The initial model of DNAJA1-JD was refined
with XPLOR-NIH version
2.31 using the following experimental
restraints: 1070 NOE distance restraints, 50 H-bond distance and angle
restraints, 38 3JNHα coupling
constant restraints, 127 13Cα/13Cβ
chemical shift restraints, and 116 dihedral angle restraints predicted
from TALOS+. All peptide bonds were constrained
to be planar and trans. A total of 400 structures
were calculated, with the 20 lowest-energy structures being subjected
to explicit water refinement based on the RECOORD protocols. An average DNAJA1-JD structure was calculated
on the basis of the average atom coordinates of the 20 water-refined
structures and subsequently minimized using the same explicit water
refinement described above.

The resulting structures were evaluated
using the RPF webserver
(http://nmr.cabm.rutgers.edu/rpf/) and PSVS software suite (http://psvs-1_5-dev.nesg.org/), which includes Verify3D, ProsaII, PROCHECK, and Molprobity. The three-dimensional structures of the proteins are represented
here using the UCSF Chimera package from the Resource for Biocomputing,
Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California, San
Francisco (http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/). ClustalW was used
(with default settings) to align the sequences of DNAJA1-JD with the
J-domains of four homologous proteins: E. coli DnaJ
J-domain [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1XBL],Homo sapiens Hsp40 (HDJ-1) J-domain (PDB entry 1HDJ),H. sapiens HSJ1a (PDB entry 2LGW), and H. sapiens DnaJ subfamily C member
12 (PDB entry 2CTQ). Electrostatic surface potentials of the protein were calculated
using Delphi. The identification of evolutionarily
conserved residues using both sequence and structure was performed
using the ConSurf server with default settings.

Identification of a Ligand Binding Site on
the DNAJA1 J-Domain
To experimentally determine a potential
functional epitope or functionally
relevant ligand binding site, we used a high-throughput NMR ligand
affinity screen using a function-based compound library., The one-dimensional (1D) 1H line broadening ligand-based
screen and 2D 1H–15N HSQC protein-based
screen follow the same procedure outlined elsewhere, using 10 and 30 μM DNAJA1-JD (5% 13C-labeled and
100% 15N-labeled), respectively. The concentrations for
the compounds were 100 μM in the 1D 1H line broadening
screen and 400 μM in the 2D 1H–15N HSQC screen.

The NMR spectra for the ligand affinity screens
were recorded on a 500 MHz Bruker Avance DRX spectrometer equipped
with a triple-resonance, Z-axis gradient cryoprobe
with a Bruker autotune and match (ATM) and BACS-120 sample changer.
All 1D 1H NMR spectra were processed with the ACD/NMR Processor
(ACD/Laboratories), and 2D 1H–15N HSQC
spectra were processed with NMRPipe and
visualized in CCPNMR Analysis.

Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) between the free and ligand-bound
2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of DNAJA1-JD were
used to define the consensus binding site. The CSPs were calculated
using a common weighting approach based
on changes in 15N and 1H chemical shifts that
occur upon ligand binding. AutoDock version 4.2.3− with the AutoDockTools
version 1.5.4, graphical interface was used
to calculate 120 protein–ligand costructures, which were filtered
using AutoDockFilter to identify the
costructures that best agree with the experimental CSPs.

Results
and Discussion
Effect of DNAJA1 Overexpression on Cellular
Stress Modulation
in Pancreatic Cancer Cells
DNAJA1 is related to the cellular
response to stress, a common event in the tumor cells due to fluctuations
in the nutrient and oxygen levels in the tumor microenvironment or
due to therapy, and can govern the response of the tumor to chemo-
and radiotherapies. Hence, we performed cell-based functional assays
of c-Jun phosphorylation to identify DNAJA1-mediated activation of
the stress response pathway in cancer cells. c-Jun is a member of
the JNK signaling pathway, and its transcriptional activity and expression
are primarily regulated by the phosphorylation of two serines, Ser63
and Ser73.− c-Jun regulates a range of cellular processes, including apoptosis,
tumorigenesis, and cell proliferation, which includes protecting cells
from stress-induced cell death., This makes c-Jun both
a positive and negative regulator of cell death. However, in several
cancers, c-Jun has been shown to inhibit apoptosis, leading to the
uncontrolled growth typical of cancer.−

Human MiaPaCa2
cells stably expressing full-length DNAJA1 or the vector control were
subjected to a 1 h incubation with anisomycin (370 nM), a protein
synthesis inhibitor, or UV treatment at 20 or 50 J/m2 doses
to mimic stress. Activation of the stress-induced JNK pathway was
measured by evaluating the downstream phosphorylation of c-Jun 20
min after treatment. The results indicate that the overexpression
of DNAJA1 (i.e., in cell line MiaPaCa2-DNAJA1) diminishes the level
of anisomycin and UV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation at residue Ser63
(Figure A). Please note the doubling of the
c-Jun bands in Figure A is a result of different
phosphorylation states of c-Jun and, correspondingly, different gel
migration rates. Cell survival was also evaluated by performing MTT
assays 24 h after treatment with anisomycin. The results indicate
that DNAJA1 expression decreased the level of cell survival under
conditions of anisomycin treatment (Figure B).

(A) Expression of full-length DNAJA1 (UniProt entry P31689) in
MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells suppresses the activation of c-Jun
in response to anisomycin (370 nM) or UV treatment (20 or 50 J/m2 doses). Twenty minutes after being treated, cells were subjected
to lysis, and the levels of phospho-c-Jun (S63) and total c-Jun were
evaluated by Western blotting. Expression levels of exogenously expressed
His-tagged DNAJA1 were evaluated by immunoblotting with the anti-His
antibody, while immunoblotting with the anti-tubulin antibody was
performed as a loading control. (B) Expression of full-length DNAJA1
in MiaPaCa2 pancreatic cancer cells decreases the level of survival
in response to anisomycin treatment-induced stress. The level of cell
survival was measured by the MTT assay 24 h after treatment (**p &lt; 0.01; ***p &lt; 0.001).

Expression of the DNAJA1 protein in MiaPaCa2 pancreatic
cancer
cell lines results in the cells being more susceptible to the stress-induced
(UV-induced DNA damage or anisomycin-induced inhibition of protein
synthesis) diminution of the level of cell survival (Figure ). DNAJA1 expression also suppresses the phosphorylation-mediated
activation of the oncogenic transcription factor, c-Jun, which is
often overexpressed and hyperphosphorylated in cancer− and has an essential role in pancreatic cancer.,

Interestingly, heat shock proteins have also been shown to
be regulators
of apoptosis, where DnaK (Hsp70) suppresses JNK activity.− Thus, our preliminary results suggest DNAJA1 potentially stimulates
the DnaK suppression of a JNK-induced anti-apoptotic signaling pathway
by forming a complex with DnaK. This hypothesis is consistent with
the 5-fold downregulation of DNAJA1 in pancreatic cancer cells, the
resulting suppression of c-Jun phosphorylation, and the corresponding
susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis by expressing DNAJA1. Obviously,
protection from stress-induced apoptosis by downregulating DNAJA1
would be beneficial because cancer cells, by definition, exist in
a stressful environment. To further investigate this role of DNAJA1
in pancreatic cancer, we determined an NMR solution structure.

Solution
Structure of the DNAJA1 J-Domain
The backbone
resonance assignments were determined for 63 (98.4%) of the assignable
64 amino acid residues (excluding the 10 non-native residues to the
N-terminal side of the His tag, and the three Pro residues). The one
amino acid for which the amide could not be assigned, Met11, is the
first residue following the His tag. The side-chain assignments were
completed using a combination of CC(CO)NH, HCC(CO)NH, HCCH-COSY, and
HCCH-TOCSY 3D NMR experiments. The backbone and side-chain assignments,
not including the 10-residue His tag, were nearly complete with 63
of 67 N, 63 of 64 HN, 67 of 67 Cα, 70 of 70 Hα, 63 of
64 Cβ, 113 of 115 Cβ, 43 of 62 Cγ, 66 of 74 Hγ,
26 of 48 Cδ, 40 of 54 Hδ, 11 of 21 Cε, 14 of 34
Hε, 0 of 9 Cζ, and 0 of 1 Hζ atoms assigned.

Using the backbone resonance assignments, a model of DNAJA1-JD was
generated using CS-ROSETTA, which utilizes chemical shifts to select
protein fragments from the PDB followed by Monte Carlo assembly and
relaxation by Rosetta., This tool has been shown to be
effective in predicting protein structures for small proteins (≤16
kDa). The model generated from CS-ROSETTA exhibited the same secondary
structure as most DnaJ proteins and agreed with the secondary structure
predicted from TALOS+. All available backbone and side-chain chemical
shift assignments have been deposited into the Biological Magnetic
Resonance Data Bank [BMRB (http://www.brmb.wisc.edu)] as
entry 19163.

The solution structure of DNAJA1-JD was calculated
using 1120 distance
restraints, 116 dihedral restraints, 127 Cα/Cβ chemical
shift restraints, and 38 3JNHα coupling constant restraints. The restraints used during the structure
calculation are summarized in Table . XPLOR-NIH
was used to calculate 400 structures, and the 20 lowest-energy structures
were selected for further refinement in water using the RECOORD protocol
implemented in XPLOR-NIH. The resulting ensemble and average structures
(Figure A,B) agreed well with the NMR data,
where the experimental restraints had low root-mean-square deviations
(rmsds) (Table ). The water-refined average
structure had no NOE violations greater than 0.5 Å or dihedral
violations greater than 5°. The water-refined ensemble of 20
structures had a backbone rmsd of 0.709 ± 0.119 Å from the
unrefined average coordinates. This result improves to 0.399 ±
0.086 Å when only the residues involved in the more stable secondary
structure elements are evaluated, which indicates the consistency
of the structure calculation using the experimental restraints (Table ). Comparing the original CS-ROSETTA homology model
to the final water-refined average structure showed backbone rmsds
of 1.803 Å (full protein) and 0.889 Å (secondary structure).

structures. (B) Ribbon representation of the average structure generated

The RPF webserver and PSVS software
suite were used to verify the
quality of the ensemble and average structures (Table ). Few unreasonable atom clashes were identified by the Molprobity
module, and our DNAJA1-JD NMR structure has a very good Z-score (−1.59) compared to the average Z-score
for NMR structures in the PDB (−10.74). This is actually comparable to the Z-scores
of medium-resolution X-ray crystal structures in the PDB (−1.39). An evaluation of the probable dihedral angles
expected for each residue using PROCHECK also shows excellent Z-scores (1.65 for ϕ and ψ dihedrals and 1.48
for all dihedrals). Additionally, 98.5% of the residues have backbone
dihedral angles in the most favored regions of Ramachandran space;
only one residue, Val12, has backbone ϕ and ψ values in
the more generously allowed region. The discriminating power (DP-score),
Recall, Precision, and F-measure scores provide global
measures of the goodness of fit between the DNAJA1-JD NMR structure
and the NOESY peak list, where a DP-score of &gt;0.75 and an F-measure of &gt;0.8 are consistent with high-quality structures.
The DP-score and F-measure calculated for the DNAJA1-JD
NMR structure are 0.852 and 0.733, respectively. Overall, the results
indicate that the final ensemble and average models for DNAJA1-JD
are good-quality structures with few to no unreasonable structural
features. The coordinates of the water-refined ensemble have been
deposited in the PDB as entry 2M6Y.

The secondary structure
and fold for DNAJA1-JD are similar to those
of other J-domains found in DnaJ homologues. In effect, our DNAJA1-JD
structure adopts the characteristic J-domain found in most species.
The structure consists of four α-helices: residues 17–21
(α1), 29–42 (α2), 52–65 (α3), and
68–75 (α4) (Figure B). The loop
between helices α2 and α3 (residues 43–51) contains
the highly conserved His-Pro-Asp (HPD) motif (residues 44–46).

The structures of 28 DnaJ proteins in various organisms have been
determined. Most of these proteins (16 structures) are from humans,
with the majority belonging to DnaJ subfamily B (six) and DnaJ subfamily
C (eight). The tertiary structure of DNAJA1-JD was compared to a few
representative structures: E. coli DnaJ J-domain
(PDB entry 1XBL), human DnaJ homologue subfamily B member 1 J-domain (PDB entry 1HDJ), human DnaJ homologue
subfamily B member 2 J-domain (PDB entry 2LGW), and human DnaJ homologue subfamily
C member 12 J-domain (PDB entry 2CTQ). All four proteins have essentially
the same tertiary structure as DNAJA1-JD with PDBeFold Z-scores of 5.148 (2.08 Å rmsd), 6.872 (1.65 Å rmsd), 4.541
(2.24 Å rmsd), and 6.904 (1.37 Å rmsd), respectively (Figure A–D). The different DnaJ homologue subfamilies
do not appear to exhibit a significant difference in structure, especially
because the best matched structure to DNAJA1 belongs to DnaJ homologue
subfamily C. Thus, the structural and functional difference between
these subfamilies likely occurs in the other DnaJ domains.

is outlined with a black box. The residues that make up helix α2
are outlined with a red box.

The human DNAJA1-JD sequence is also very well conserved
in J-domains
from other organisms, with 56 proteins having ≥49% identical
sequences. The sequences of representative DnaJ proteins 1XBL, 1HDJ, 2LGW, and 2CTQ have 51, 56, 47,
and 32% identical sequences, respectively (Figure E). As expected, all five proteins have the highly conserved
HPD motif. Additionally, helix α2 is highly conserved except
for protein 2CTQ. This is interesting and potentially functionally relevant because
helix α2 tends to be positively charged and represents a possible
binding site for DnaK (Hsp70).

Identification of Potential
Protein Binding Sites on the DNAJA1
J-Domain
One of the primary functions for DnaJ is to stimulate
the ATPase activity of DnaK. The primary function of the J-domain
of DnaJ is to bind to the ATPase domain on DnaK. As previously mentioned,
the main feature of J-domain proteins is a highly conserved HPD motif,
which may indicate its importance in binding to DnaK. Thus, identifying
a ligand binding site that overlaps with this proposed DnaK binding
site would provide further validation of the location and existence
of a potential DnaK binding site. Critically, a specific DnaK or DnaK-like
protein that binds DNAJA1 has not been identified. It is simply hypothesized
to exist on the basis of analogy with other DnaJ proteins.

The PDB contains only one example of a
J-domain in complex with DnaK. This example (PDB entry 2QWN) is a crystal structure
of the bovine auxilin (DnaJ homologue subfamily C) J-domain chemically
cross-linked with bovine DnaK at the conserved HPD motif., A sequence alignment of the residues between the bovine auxilin
J-domain and DNAJA1-JD allows for a prediction of the proposed DnaJ–DnaK
interaction site (Figure A). This proposed
binding site includes the highly conserved HPD motif. However, there
is some contention about whether the cross-linked complex is biologically
relevant or whether auxilin accurately represents most interactions
of DnaJ with DnaK.−

conserved HPD motif (green box). The conserved HPD motif and helix
α2, which is potentially an important component of the DnaJ–DnaK
interaction site and the TIM16-like inhibitory binding site, are labeled.

A previous NMR analysis revealed
chemical shift perturbations (CSPs)
in 2D 1H–15N HSQC experiments when the E. coli DnaJ J-domain is bound to E. coli DnaK. The majority of the perturbed
residues in the E. coli DnaJ J-domain occurred along
helix α2. An alignment of the E. coli DnaJ
J-domain and human DNAJA1-JD sequences allowed us to map those same
perturbed residues onto the human DNAJA1-JD sequence and structure
(Figure B). This process identifies a possible
DnaK binding site on DNAJA1-JD that includes helix α2 instead
of the HPD motif predicted from the DnaJ–DnaK X-ray structure.
Helix α2 is an intriguing location for a potential protein binding
site because it presents a positively charged surface. Coincidentally,
the proposed DnaJ binding site on DnaK has a negatively charged surface,
which further supports the identification of helix α2 as a binding
site for DnaK. Additionally, mutations of residues in helix α2
inhibit the DnaJ–DnaK interaction, further implicating the
importance of helix α2 in binding DnaK.,

Another potential protein interaction site on DNAJA1-JD may
be
linked to the inhibition of DnaJ activity. TIM14 is a related DnaJ
protein that is essential for the transport of proteins across the
outer membrane of mitochondria by stimulating ATPase activity of mitochondrial
Hsp70. Any mutation in the HPD motif
of TIM14 effectively inhibits its activity, which indicates the importance
of the HPD motif in the function of DnaJ proteins. Importantly, TIM14
activity is inhibited when TIM14 is bound to TIM16. TIM16 is another
J-domain-like protein, but it lacks the HPD motif. The location of
the TIM14–TIM16 interaction site partially overlaps with the
proposed DnaK binding site that includes residues in helix α2. A sequence alignment of TIM14 with DNAJA1-JD
indicates an essentially identical overlap (Figure C), where four of the 15 residues that make up the proposed
DnaK binding site are also part of the potential inhibition site (Figure D). Thus, the binding of a TIM16-like protein to
DNAJA1 would sterically interfere with DnaK binding because of this
partial overlap in protein binding sites. Again, a TIM16-like protein
that binds DNAJA1 has not been identified. Thus, the DnaK binding
site is located in the highly conserved HPD motif or helix α2,
where a potential inhibitory binding site also involves helix α2.
Our ligand binding assay may provide some further insight regarding
these potential protein binding sites on DNAJA1-JD.

Identification
of a Ligand Binding Site on the DNAJA1 J-Domain
A high-throughput
NMR ligand affinity screen, was performed with
a function-based compound library., The library
contains ∼460 biologically active compounds consisting
of known drugs, protein inhibitors, metabolites, substrates, carbohydrates,
fatty acids, hormones, and cofactors. The 1D 1H line broadening
screen identified 27 possible binders. A 2D 1H–15N HSQC screen identified only seven compounds that induced
chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) upon binding with DNAJA1-JD: O-phospho-l-serine, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate,
Bay 11-7082, β-NADPH, ureidosuccinic acid, 2-aminophenol, and d-glucosamine. The seven compounds induced CSPs to the same
set of residues, inferring a consistent and unique ligand binding
site. Most of the compounds are small, and five of the compounds have
a phosphate group or a carboxylic acid group, both of which are likely
to be deprotonated at pH 7.0, leaving negatively charged molecules.
Importantly, the chemical library contained other compounds with a
phosphate or carboxylic acid groups that did not bind DNAJA1-JD, eliminating
the likelihood of a nonspecific binding interaction driven only by
charge interactions. No other common chemical motif or scaffold is
apparent.

Of the seven compounds, O-phospho-l-serine had the greatest number of CSPs (nine) in the 2D 1H–15N HSQC screen (Figure A). Using the size of O-phospho-l-serine and our CSP-Consensus program, every residue with an observed
CSP was determined to be part of a consensus ligand binding site.
A DNAJA1-JD–O-phospho-l-serine costructure
was then determined on the basis of these CSPs using AutoDock and
AutoDockFilter, which identifies the docked pose that best matches
the chemical shift perturbation data. The costructure selected by AutoDockFilter (Figure B) had an AutoDock binding energy of −2.66 kcal/mol,
which fits with the average AutoDock binding energy of −2.54
± 0.40 kcal/mol for all of the docked poses. The costructure
has nine residues with any atom within 6 Å of the docked ligand:
Ala40, Leu41, Lys42, Tyr43, His44, Lys47, Asn48, Glu51, and Lys54
(Figure C). Six of these residues were perturbed
in the 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum (Figure A). However, there may be some differences between
the predicted costructure and the actual complex in solution because
of local structural rearrangements upon ligand binding. This is likely
to occur because AutoDock used a static model of DNAJA1-JD.

diagram of DNAJA1-JD bound with O-phospho-l-serine, with the residues showing a chemical shift perturbation

shift perturbation with every binding ligand colored red. (C) Expanded
view of O-phospho-l-serine bound to a ribbon

the ligand are displayed.

On the basis of the protein–ligand costructure, the
binding
site coincides with the predicted inhibition site based on the TIM14–TIM16
complex (Figure A). The O-phospho-l-serine binding site is also consistent with the
locations of chemical shift perturbations observed for the other compounds
shown to bind in the FAST-NMR assay., Surprisingly,
this ligand binding site is not particularly well conserved (Figure B). This fact would benefit a drug discovery effort
that targets the proposed DNAJA1–TIM16-like complex. While
the J-domain is a common fold, the predicted DNAJA1–TIM16-like
interaction site appears to be sequence specific, which means drug
selectivity can be achieved. Because most of the binding ligands have
negatively charged groups, it seems likely that the compounds have
an electrostatic interaction with the positively charged region on
helix α2 (Figure C). Additionally, most
of the protein surface, including the binding site, consists of hydrophilic
residues, indicating that hydrophobic interactions are unlikely to
be energetically favorable. These properties may explain why most
of the ligands shown to bind to DNAJA1-JD were small and negatively
charged. Nevertheless, these results provide further support for the
existence of an inhibitory protein binding site on DNAJA1-JD and the
importance of helix α2 to the function of DNAJA1-JD. It is important
to note that the ligands shown to bind DNAJA1-JD have a low binding
affinity (KD &gt; 100 to 50 μM),
are
unlikely to inhibit protein–protein interactions, and have
not been shown to inhibit DNAJA1-JD protein binding or to be biologically
active in pancreatic cancer cells. Instead, they are simple chemical
probes of DNAJA1-JD functional epitopes and provide experimental evidence
that supports the identification of the predicted inhibitory protein
binding site on DNAJA1-JD.

which is potentially an important component of the DnaJ–DnaK
interaction site and the TIM16-like inhibitory binding site, is labeled.

Conclusions
Cell-based
functional assays showed that the overexpression of
DNAJA1 suppresses the stress response capabilities of the oncogenic
transcription factor, c-Jun, which is often overexpressed and hyperphosphorylated
in cancer cells. c-Jun is part of the JNK signaling pathway, and its
phosphorylation state can promote apoptosis or cell proliferation.
DnaK has previously been shown to suppress the JNK pathway, which
inhibits the hyperphosphorylated, anti-apoptosis state found in pancreatic
cancer cells. The DNAJA1-JD NMR structure combined with a bioinformatics
analysis and a ligand affinity screen identified a potential DnaK-like
binding site and TIM16-like inhibitory binding site. Interestingly,
both of these binding sites involve conserved helix α2 and suggest
DNAJA1 activity is highly regulated. The NMR ligand affinity screen
provided further experimental support for the existence of the TIM16-like
inhibitory binding site. On the basis of these observations, we propose
a stress response pathway involving DNAJA1 (Figure ). In the absence of stress, DNAJA1 would be inactivated by
forming an inhibitory complex with a TIM16-like protein. In the presence
of environmental stress, DNAJA1 would activate a DnaK protein by forming
a complex that suppresses the JNK pathway, the hyperphosphorylation
of c-Jun, and the anti-apoptosis state. Conversely, the downregulation
of DNAJA1 in pancreatic cancer cells likely lowers the activity of
DnaK even under conditions of stress, which allows for the hyperphosphorylation
of c-Jun and the cell proliferation that is a hallmark of cancer.
Thus, the overlapping protein binding interfaces on DNAJA1-JD may
be interesting targets for future drug discovery efforts related to
pancreatic cancer. Specifically, a drug that disrupts the predicted
DNAJA1–TIM16-like inhibitory complex may activate DnaK even
in the absence of a stress response. Thus, a constitutively active
DnaK may lead to a cascade of events resulting in cell death through
the inactivation of JNK and a decrease in the level of c-Jun phosphorylation.
Because the overexpression of DNAJA1 reduces pancreatic cancer cell
survivability under stress, the J-domain of DNAJA1 itself may be a
valuable biological target for treating pancreatic cancer as part
of a combination therapy.

Illustration of the proposed role of DNAJA1
and DnaK on the JNK
pathway and c-Jun phosphorylation. The activation of DNAJA1 through
the interaction with DnaK appears to suppress the JNK pathway, thus
keeping c-Jun in the inactive state. However, inhibiting binding of
DNAJA1 to DnaK, as TIM16 does, would allow for the hyperphosphorylation
of c-Jun, which has an anti-apoptotic effect.
