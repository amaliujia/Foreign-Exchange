The sense of hearing depends
on reliable and temporally precise neurotransmitter release at the
synapses of cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs). IHCs contain sensory hair bundle structures composed of microvilli
(stereocilia) arranged in rows of graded height that protrude from
the apical tip of the cell. Minute displacements of the hair bundle
open mechanically gated ion channels that depolarize the cell. This change in membrane potential triggers an
influx of calcium into the cell that in turn results in the fusion
of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and the release of the
neurotransmitter., Calcium-regulated exocytosis and
neurotransmitter release exhibit fast kinetics in achieving exquisite
temporal fidelity. To aid in fidelity,
IHCs contain specialized structures for tethering synaptic vesicles
at release sites called synaptic ribbons, allowing for high rates
of sustained synaptic transmission.

The calcium-triggered fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane
is believed to be driven by the assembly of SNARE proteins. However, SNARE proteins are insensitive to calcium. In neurons, the protein synaptotagmin I confers
calcium sensitivity to SNARE-mediated fast synchronous neurotransmission., However, Yasunaga et al. have reported that synaptotagmin I was
not detected in mature IHCs, and it has
been suggested that IHCs have evolved a unique calcium sensor, otoferlin,
for calcium-regulated synaptic transmission. However, the relationship between otoferlin and SNAREs and whether
neural SNAREs are required for neurotransmitter release from hair
cells have yet to be fully elucidated.

Roux et al. have reported that mice lacking otoferlin were
profoundly
deaf and lack synaptic vesicle exocytosis in IHCs. Otoferlin is also required for calcium-dependent synaptic
exocytosis at immature outer hair cells (OHCs) and type I vestibular
hair cells., In addition to exocytosis, otoferlin
is known to interact with the endocytotic proteins AP-2 and myosin-6,
suggesting that otoferlin may also contribute to the replenishment
of synaptic vesicles.−

Otoferlin belongs to the ferlin family of proteins
and consists
of six C2 domains (C2A–C2F) linked in tandem followed by a
single-pass C-terminal transmembrane region. C2 domains bind calcium and lipids and are found in proteins involved
in membrane trafficking and signal transduction.− Johnson et
al. have shown that with the exception of the C2A domain, the C2 domains
of otoferlin interact with calcium and bind lipids.− In addition,
otoferlin stimulates SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in a calcium-dependent
manner in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that otoferlin
acts as a synaptotagmin I-like calcium sensor for fusion. However, a recent study found that synaptotagmin
cannot rescue the otoferlin knockout phenotype, suggesting functional
differences between the proteins. In
addition, Pangrsic et al. have reported that the C2F domain lacks
calcium binding and did not bind to phosphatidylserine, raising questions
about which domains bind calcium and the lipid binding specificity
of the protein. Thus, the biochemical
properties of the C2 domains of otoferlin are still controversial.
The lipid and calcium binding properties of synaptic proteins are
critical characteristics that define and shape the release properties
of a synapse, and thus, without a full quantitative characterization
of these activities, an understanding of otoferlin’s function
in hair cells will remain elusive.

In this study, the intrinsic
calcium binding properties of each
C2 domain were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).
The lipid binding specificity and effects of lipids on calcium binding
were also assessed using liposome sedimentation assays and laurdan
fluorescence measurements. Lastly, the interaction of loop residues
within the C2F domain with liposomes was tested through use of an
environmentally sensitive unnatural amino acid.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
POPS (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine), POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine),
PI4P [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol-4′-phosphate)
(ammonium salt)], and PI(4,5)P2 [phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1′-myoinositol-4′,5′-bisphosphate)
(ammonium salt)] were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster,
AL). Ni2+-NTA Sepharose high-performance beads were purchased
from GE-Hamersham Biosciences (Pittsburgh, PA). Other common reagents
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Protein Constructs
C2 domain constructs of otoferlin
were reported previously., For the incorporation
of the noncanonical amino acid acridon-2-ylalanine, mutagenesis was
conducted on the pMCSG9 vector containing the otoferlin C2F domain
at phenylalanine 1833 or 1746, converting the codon to a TAG site.
Primers for the mutation were designed as mismatch primers to the
nucleotide site of interest. Otoferlin C2C (K478A and K480A) and C2F
(D1743/1831A and D1754/1837A) domains were constructed using the Stratagene
QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with the pMCSG9/6His-MBP-otoferlin
C2C and C2F plasmid templates, respectively.

Expression and Purification
of the His-MBP-C2 Domains
The pMCSG9 vectors containing the
otoferlin C2 domains were transformed
into BL21 Escherichia coli cells. The bacterial cultures
(OD600 = 0.6) were induced for 3–4 h at 37 °C
with 1 mM IPTG. The C2F F1746 and F1833 acridon-2-ylalanine noncanonical
amino acid constructs were expressed in autoinduction medium with
1 mM acridon-2-ylalanine using a previously reported method., The cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer containing protease
inhibitors (0.5 mM PMSF, 1–2 μg/mL aprotinin, leupeptin,
and pepstatin A). The lysis buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)
and 150 mM NaCl. The soluble fraction of the lysate was incubated
with Ni-NTA resin for 3 h at 4 °C, and the Ni-NTA resin was washed
with lysis buffer containing Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole
before the bound protein was eluted with Tris-HCl buffer containing
500 mM imidazole. Purified proteins were extensively dialyzed in ITC
buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl] and concentrated
using an Ultrafree-10 centrifugal filter unit (Millipore Inc., Bedford,
MA). The protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance using
extinction coefficients of each protein based on sequence. Figure
1 of the  shows a
representative sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) gel illustrating the purity of the C2 domains of
otoferlin.

used in this study. Otoferlin is composed of six C2 domains and a

were generated according to the amino acid designations listed at
the right.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Isothermal titration
calorimetry was conducted using a Nano ITC instrument (TA Instruments).
The calcium binding experiments were conducted at 37 °C, and
lipid binding was conducted at 30 °C. The proteins were dialyzed
extensively in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM
NaCl. Stock calcium chloride solutions were prepared in the corresponding
buffers of each protein and were loaded into a 50 μL syringe.
This titrant was injected with a stirring speed of 250 rpm at discrete
intervals of 180 s. Calcium was added in 1 μL injections 45
times for each experiment, and the heat evolved per injection was
measured. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were used to determine
the binding of lipids to the C2F domain of otoferlin in the absence
or presence of 1 mM calcium chloride. The lipid suspension contained
the same calcium concentration as the buffer. The concentration of
the C2F domain of otoferlin ranged from 40 to 400 μM, and that
of the lipid suspension varied from 5 to 10 mM. The lipid suspensions
were added as 1 μL injections 45–47 times with a stirring
speed of 250 rpm at discrete intervals of 180 s. The heat of dilution
was determined by adding the titrant to the corresponding buffer in
the absence of protein and was subtracted to obtain the effective
heat of binding. All ITC data were analyzed using Nano ITC analysis
software.

Phospholipid Vesicles
The preparation of SUVs was performed
according to reported methods. Briefly,
chloroform solutions composed of 25% POPS and 75% POPC, 50% POPS and
50% POPC, 95% POPC and 5% PI(4,5)P2, 95% POPC and 5% PI(4)P, or 100%
POPC were mixed and dried under a stream of liquid nitrogen gas and
then dried under vacuum for 3 h. The dried lipids were resuspended
in buffer and extruded 20 times through a 50 nm filter (Avanti Polar
Lipids, Inc.) to produce small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs).

Sedimentation
Assay
For the binding assay, the C2 domains
of otoferlin (5 μg) were mixed with SUVs (100 μg) in buffer
[20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl] with calcium (10, 100, and 1
mM) or EGTA (1 mM). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C
and centrifuged at 85000g for 45 min in a TA-100
ultracentrifuge (Beckmann Instruments). SDS–PAGE gel data presented
for calcium titration experiments consist of total protein control
(total input), supernatant (soluble fraction), and pellet (lipid-bound
fraction).

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence
spectra were
recorded on a PTI QuantaMaster fluorometer with 5 nm excitation and
emission slit widths. Assays were conducted at 37 °C in a quartz
micro cuvette. The fluorescence intensity of oto-C2F F1833Acd and
F1746Acd (2 μM) was observed in the presence of liposomes composed
of 100% POPC and 45% POPS, 50% POPC, and 5% PI(4,5)P2 in the presence
of calcium or EDTA. Data were collected using FelixGX set at 1.0 nm
intervals with an integration time of 0.1 s. Laurdan experiments were
conducted as described previously. Briefly,
excitation at 350 nm was used, and the generalized polarization (GP)
value was calculated using emission values at 430 and 480 nm. The
reported values represent means ± the standard deviation (SD)
for three samples.

Results
Characterization of the
Calcium Binding Properties of Otoferlin
We used ITC to determine
the intrinsic calcium binding properties
of the C2 domains of otoferlin in solution, adapting an approach previously
described for the C2 domains of PKC and synaptotagmin I., ITC measures the heat exchange associated with binding by titrating
the ligand to the macromolecule. It also provides a complete set of
thermodynamic parameters of ligand–macromolecule interaction,
including the binding affinity and changes in enthalpy and entropy.
We performed the titration of isolated domains of otoferlin with calcium
chloride (an overview of the constructs tested is given in Figure ).

Overall, five of the six domains of otoferlin
bound calcium (Figure ). The C2A domain of
otoferlin did not bind calcium, in agreement with previous studies., The measured heats of binding for domains C2B–C2F were fit
using a two-site binding model that assumes that more than one ligand
can bind independently. The best-fit Kd values ranged from 25 to 95 μM for the first site and from
400 to 750 μM for the second (Figure ). Binding of calcium to the moderate-affinity site is exothermic,
whereas binding of calcium to the low-affinity site is endothermic.
The fitted values are listed in Table . Typically,
C2 domains interact with calcium using aspartate residues located
in the loop regions of the domains, and to explicitly test whether
aspartate residues are required for otoferlin–calcium interaction,
we tested two double aspartate mutants in C2F (D1743/1831A and D1754/1837A).
Both mutants failed to bind calcium (Figure ). We also conducted titrations with a tandem C2AB domain of otoferlin
to probe for interdomain effects on calcium binding (Figures  and ). The C2AB construct
bound calcium with apparent Kd values
of 50 and 475 μM (Table ). This negligible
deviation from the calcium affinity of the isolated C2B domain suggests
that the C2A domain and linker between the domains have no effect
on the calcium binding affinity of the C2B domain.

Titrations were performed at 37
°C in 20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl. The following

C2B, 400 μM C2C, 390 μM C2D, 450 μM C2E, 390 μM
C2F, 380 μM C2AB, 320 μM C2F D1743/1831A, and 340 μM
C2F D1754/1837A. The syringe contained 20–30 mM CaCl2.

The C2 Domains of Otoferlin Bind Liposomes
We next
sought to determine if the calcium binding affinities of the domains
are modified in the presence of lipids. We therefore performed sedimentation
assays on 75% PC/25% PS and 50% PC/50% PS liposomes mixed with C2
domains of otoferlin in the presence of calcium or EDTA. The C2A domain of otoferlin bound liposomes
poorly regardless of the presence of calcium, while the C2B domain
bound liposomes in the absence of calcium, with ≥100 μM
calcium enhancing C2B–liposome interaction (Figure A,B). By contrast, binding between liposomes and
the C2C–C2E domains was sensitive to low concentrations of
calcium (∼5–10 μM) (Figure A,B and Figure of the ). Although the C2F domain binds calcium, binding to PS/PC liposomes
was calcium-independent (Figure A,B and Figure
2 of the ). We found
that although the C2F mutants D1743/1831A and D1754/1837A failed to
bind calcium, the mutants did bind to PS/PC liposomes (Figure C). These results indicate that the calcium and
lipid membrane binding activities of C2F are independent. We also
conducted sedimentation assays with 50% PS and found that higher levels
of PS did not enhance binding, suggesting that 25% PS is saturating
(Figure 3 of the ). None of the domains bound 100% PC liposomes under any conditions,
indicating the requirement for anionic lipids (Figure D). As a negative control, PS/PC liposome sedimentation assays
were also conducted with the maltose binding protein, which does not
bind liposomes (Figure E).

the supernatant and P the pellet.

We next tested each C2 domain for PI(4,5)P2 binding by conducting
sedimentation assays on liposomes composed of 95% PC and 5% PI(4,5)P2.
Only the C2C and C2F domains of otoferlin were found to bind PI(4,5)P2,
and binding was calcium-independent (Figure A,B). Many C2 domains, including the C2B domain of synaptotagmin,
interact with PI(4,5)P2 in a calcium-independent manner through a
set of conserved basic lysine residues. These lysine residues (K478
and K480) appear to be conserved in the C2C domain of otoferlin. To
investigate whether the lysine residues contribute to PI(4,5)P2 binding,
we generated K478A, K480A, and double (K478/480A) mutants. When tested,
PI(4,5)P2 binding for all mutants was attenuated relative to that
of the wild type (Figure C,D). However, lysine
mutants retained the ability to bind PS/PC liposomes in a calcium-dependent
manner (Figure E). Thus, the calcium-independent
PI(4,5)P2 binding activity of C2C is distinct from the calcium-dependent
PS binding activity.

Previous studies have utilized the solvatochromic fluorescent
membrane
probe laurdan to measure the lipid binding properties of the C2 domains
of otoferlin. These studies determined
that binding of otoferlin to laurdan harboring liposomes results in
a blue shift in the emission maxima and an increase in the general
polarization (GP) value of the probe, and we next sought to use the
changes in GP values to determine whether PI(4,5)P2 can steer otoferlin
to a preferred liposome by conducting competition assays (Figure ). First, we measured the change in the laurdan
GP value when each C2 domain of otoferlin (5 μM) was mixed with
liposomes composed of 69% PC, 25% PS, 5% PI(4,5)P2, and 1% laurdan
in the presence or absence of calcium (Figure , black bars). Next we repeated the measurements with samples containing
a mixture of 69% PC, 25% PS, 5% PI(4,5)P2, and 1% laurdan and 75%
PC/25% PS liposomes lacking PI(4,5)P2 and laurdan (Figure , white bars). For domains C2C and C2F, the change
in the GP values for the mixed liposome sample was equivalent to that
of samples containing only PI(4,5)P2 liposomes. This suggests that
C2C and C2F domains preferentially bound to PI(4,5)P2 liposomes and
did not bind PC/PS liposomes appreciably. By contrast, for domains
C2B, C2D, and C2E, the change in GP in the mixed liposome sample was
smaller than those of samples containing only PI(4,5)P2 liposomes,
suggesting that these domains were distributed between both sets of
liposomes, resulting in a smaller change in GP. Thus, the C2C and
C2F domains are selectively steered to PI(4,5)P2-containing lipid
bilayers.

liposomes (white bars) in either 100 μM EDTA or 500 μM
calcium (N = 3; *P &lt; 0.05).

Characterization of the
Lipid Binding Properties of the Otoferlin
C2F Domain
Unlike the other C2 domains of otoferlin, including
C2B, the liposome binding activity of C2F appears to be completely
calcium independent. However, ITC measurements indicate that the domain
does bind calcium. We therefore conducted a quantitative analysis
of the lipid binding activity of this domain in the presence and absence
of calcium to more fully characterize any effects calcium may have
on lipid binding.

ITC titrations of the C2F domain of otoferlin
with PS/PC liposomes in the absence and presence of calcium are shown
in Figure . After accounting for the fact
that the C2F domain binds only anionic lipids on the outer leaflet
of liposomes, we fit the data to a one-site binding model. In the
absence of calcium, the C2F domain of otoferlin bound membranes with
a Kd value of 92.1 ± 13.2 μM.
In agreement with the sedimentation results, calcium did not alter
the binding affinity, with a fitted Kd value of 81.0 ± 12.1 μM in the presence of calcium (Table ). Positive ΔH and ΔS values were associated with binding.

To quantify
the effect of PI(4,5)P2 on the membrane binding activity
the C2F domain, we titrated PC/PS/PI(4,5)P2 phospholipid membranes
(Figure ). The best fit of the data to a one-site
binding model indicates that the C2F domain binds with a Kd value of 6.3 ± 2.7 μM. Thus, the binding
affinity increased by 12-fold in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 compared
to that for PS/PC membranes (Table ). In agreement
with the sedimentation assay results, we did not observe any effect
of calcium on the binding of C2F to PC/PS/PI(4,5)P2 liposomes. Titrations
with 100% POPC liposomes did not show appreciable binding (Figure
4 of the ). As a
negative control, titrations of 50% PS/50% PC liposomes with the maltose
binding protein were also conducted (Figure 4 of the ).

In addition
to the presynaptic region, otoferlin also localizes
to the Golgi and has been hypothesized to play a role in trans-Golgi
trafficking., The cytoplasmic leaflet of the
Golgi membrane contains PI4P, and we therefore sought to test for
the effects of calcium on C2F–PI4P binding by titrating phospholipid
membranes composed of PC, PS, and PI4P in the absence and presence
of calcium (Figure ). In the absence of calcium,
the C2F domain bound liposomes with a Kd value of 29.1 ± 4.39 μM. In the presence of 1 mM calcium,
only modest changes in affinity were found (Kd value of 32.6 ± 0.15 μM). Thus, membrane binding
is enhanced 3-fold compared to that of PS/PC membranes (Table ).

The C2B domain
of synaptotagmin I docks to PI(4,5)P2 in a calcium-independent
manner, and elevations in intracellular calcium levels induce a reorientation
of the C2 domains such that side chains found in the calcium binding
loops of both C2 domains insert into the lipid bilayer. Specifically,
IAEDANS fluorescence-based studies have identified loops 1 and 3 of
both C2A and C2B as directly interacting with lipid bilayers., If the C2F domain of otoferlin acts similarly, it would provide
an explanation for the calcium binding activity of the domain. In
support of this, a sequence alignment indicates that phenylalanine
1833 in otoferlin C2F is found at the equivalent position as the membrane
penetrating phenylalanine 234 in synaptotagmin C2A. To determine if
F1833 resides at the C2 domain–lipid binding interface, F1833
was replaced with acridon-2-ylalanine (Acd), a noncanonical amino
acid with an environmentally sensitive fluorescence emission spectrum
(Figure A). When
it was tested, the fluorescence emission profile for Acd-labeled C2F
changed significantly when it was mixed with PS/PC/PI(4,5)P2 liposomes
(Figure B). The observed fluorescence change
was unaltered by calcium. No change in fluorescence was observed when
the domain was mixed with 100% PC liposomes (Figure B). In addition, when F1746, which is located on the opposite
side of the domain from F1833, was replaced with Acd, no change in
the emission spectra was observed for liposomes regardless of lipid
composition or the presence of calcium. These results suggest the
lipid binding region of C2F is restricted to the putative calcium
binding loops of the domain and that the interaction with anionic
lipids in the bilayer is calcium-independent. Results of sedimentation
assays conducted with Acd C2F domain were indistinguishable from those
of the wild-type C2F domain, suggesting that the Acd did not appreciably
alter the properties of the domain (Figure C).

Discussion
Otoferlin
is believed to be a calcium sensor required for exocytosis
in inner hair cells, as well as neurotransmitter release in immature
outer hair cells. Given the importance of otoferlin’s calcium
and lipid binding properties for neurotransmitter release, the goal
of our work was to measure the intrinsic calcium binding affinity
and calcium-mediated interaction of the C2 domains of otoferlin with
anionic lipid membranes. Figure A summaries
the results of our studies.

Summary and possible mechanisms of action.

In the absence of calcium, synaptic vesicle-bound otofelrin contacts
the presynaptic membrane through the interaction of PI(4,5)P2 with
the C2C and C2F domains. Increased intracellular calcium concentrations
would drive additional C2 domain–lipid interaction with either
the synaptic vesicle membrane or presynaptic membrane.

Otoferlin Binds Calcium with Moderate to Low Affinity in the
Absence of Membranes
With the exception of C2A, the C2 domains
of otoferlin bound calcium ions with moderate (Kd = 25–95 μM) and low affinity constants (Kd = 400–700 μM) in solution. The
moderate-affinity site is in agreement with the work of Johnson et
al., who reported that the apparent dissociation constant for calcium
binding ranged from 13 to 25 μM. Their results may represent calcium binding to the first site but
not the second site. Mutations to the conserved aspartate residues
of the C2F domain (D1743/1831A and D1754/1837A) of otoferlin abolished
calcium binding. Measurements of tandem domains did not reveal any
cooperative binding properties, suggesting that the domains bind calcium
independently. Remarkably, despite variations in the composition of
the putative calcium binding loops across the domains, all of otoferlin’s
C2 domains were determined to possess similar binding affinities.
This contrasts with the otoferlin homologue dysferlin, which displays
greater variation in calcium binding affinities, ranging from approximately
1 μM to 1 mM. In comparison to
those of synaptotagmin I, otoferlin’s calcium binding affinities
are equivalent or slightly higher, as the C2B domain of synaptotagmin
binds calcium with solution Kd values
in the range of 300–600 μM.,

Influence of Acidic Lipids on the Calcium Binding Properties
of the C2 Domains of Otoferlin
Otoferlin bound to multiple
calcium ions with apparent affinities of 20–50 and 400–700
μM in solution. These values are low relative to the calcium
concentrations believed to elicit release at hair cell synapses and
thus difficult to reconcile with a role for otoferlin as the calcium
sensor for neurotransmitter release. However, in the presence of PS,
calcium concentrations of 10 μM resulted in significant C2–liposome
interaction for C2C–C2E domains, suggesting that the presence
of acidic lipids enhances the calcium binding affinity for some of
the domains to physiologically relevant values. This effect was not
detected for C2F and was less pronounced for C2B. Thus, otoferlin
possesses domains that appear to operate using an “electrostatic
switch” mechanism, as well as domains that bind regardless
of calcium. Although calcium-independent membrane binding has been
reported for the C2 domains of dysferlin, neither C2 domain of synaptotagmin I binds appreciably to PS-containing
liposomes in the absence of calcium, suggesting a difference in the
mechanisms by which synaptotagmin I and otoferlin bind membranes.

PI(4,5)P2 Binding Properties of the C2 Domains of Otoferlin
PI(4,5)P2 is a major signaling molecule at the presynapse, and
thus, we sought to determine if the C2 domains of otoferlin have a
preference for phosphoinositide lipids. Our studies indicate that
only the C2C and C2F domains of otoferlin bind PI(4,5)P2 and that
binding is calcium-independent. This result differs from that of a
recent study of the C2F domain that reported the calcium sensitivity
of the C2F–PI(4,5)P2 interaction. However, this study used free PI(4,5)P2 lipids instead of mixed
composition liposomes, and thus, a direct comparison cannot be made.
However, we found that aspartate mutant forms of C2F that do not bind
calcium did bind PI(4,5)P2 liposomes, supporting the conclusion that
PIP2 binding is calcium-independent. Many C2 domains contain a polybasic
region with cationic and aromatic residues (YXK/Q Xn1 KXK) that is
known to interact with the phosphate moieties of the inositol ring., This polybasic region appears to be conserved (YVQ VFFAGQ KGK) in the C2C domain
of otoferlin but does not appear to be conserved in C2F. Mutation
of these lysines in C2C (K478A and K480A) weakened PI(4,5)P2 binding.
However, the lysine mutants bound POPS/POPC liposomes like the wild-type
C2C domain, suggesting that different residues mediate phosphatidylserine
and phosphatidylinositol binding and that that these binding activities
can be selectively abrogated. ITC measurements indicate that PI(4,5)P2
enhanced liposome binding for the C2F domain by 12-fold but by only
3-fold for PI4P relative to PS/PC liposomes, indicating a specificity
for the bisphosphate. The C2B domain of synaptotagmin interacts with
PI(4,5)P2 in a calcium-independent manner, and this interaction is
believed to target the protein to the presynaptic membrane., The C2C and C2F domains of otoferlin may act in a similar manner,
targeting otoferlin to the presynaptic region of the cell and positioning
it for calcium-induced neurotransmitter release (Figure B). Indeed, our laurdan measurements suggest C2C
and C2F preferentially target PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes.

Given that C2F–lipid membrane interaction is calcium-independent,
the exact reason for the calcium binding activity of this domain is
unclear. Studies of the domains of synaptotagmin have demonstrated
a calcium-triggered reorientation of the C2 domains as well as penetration
of hydrophobic side chains into the lipid bilayer, as demonstrated
using the fluorescent probe AEDANS., Our study
using a fluorescent unnatural amino acid in one of the putative calcium
binding loops indicates that the side chain interacts with liposomes
in an anionic lipid-dependent manner. However, no evidence of calcium-induced
changes was detected, suggesting that although the loop does interact
with lipids, the mechanism may be different from that of the C2 domains
of synaptotagmin. Rather than lipid interaction, calcium binding to
C2F may facilitate other actions, including vesicle priming and fusion.
In support of this, several studies have demonstrated calcium sensitive
protein binding and membrane fusion activity in vitro.,
