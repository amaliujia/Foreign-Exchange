Conjugative
DNA transfer is
the major cause of rapid dissemination of antibiotic resistance and
virulence factors in bacterial pathogens. During bacterial conjugation,
a donor bacterium intimately contacts a recipient to form a conjugative
pore (a bacterial type IV secretion system) through which a single-stranded
DNA is transferred from the donor to the recipient bacterium., In the F and F-like plasmid-mediated bacterial conjugation systems,
more than 20 different proteins are involved in DNA processing and
conjugative pore formation, most of which are expressed from the polycistronic tra operon in the plasmid. Transcription
of the tra operon requires TraJ, an essential activator
of the tra operon promoter, PY.

The traJ gene is located immediately upstream
of the tra operon in the F and F-like plasmids, encoding
a cytoplasmic protein that binds DNA upstream of PY presumably
through its putative C-terminal helix–turn–helix (HTH)
DNA-binding motif (Figure S1 of the ). TraJ is thought to
function to relieve PY from H-NS (histone-like nucleoid
structuring protein) repression as well as to activate PY in an independent mechanism together with a host factor, ArcA.− As a central regulator of bacterial conjugation, the intracellular
level of TraJ is stringently regulated at multiple levels by different
host and plasmid-encoded factors. CRP (catabolite repressor protein)
and Lrp (leucine-responsive protein) regulate traJ transcription,− whereas Hfq (host factor for Qβ replicase)
and the plasmid-encoded FinOP (fertility inhibition) system affect
TraJ translation.− Heat shock chaperonin protein GroEL and the Escherichia coli CpxAR two-component system have been found
to mediate proteolytic degradation of TraJ.−

Despite
limited pairwise amino acid sequence identity, all F family
TraJ homologues are predicted to have a PAS domain in the N-terminal
region (Figure S1 of the )., PAS domains commonly function as sensors
in signaling proteins to regulate diverse physiological processes
in all three kingdoms of life., PAS domains are characterized
by a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, flanked by varied numbers
of α-helices. Some of the well-characterized PAS proteins include
FixL, which is involved in nitrogen fixation in bacteria; PER, which controls circadian behavior in insects; and HIF proteins, which regulate the response
to hypoxia in mammals. Typically, PAS
domains are covalently linked to and regulate the activities of various
effector domains, including enzymes, transcription factors/DNA-binding
domains, ion channels, and chemotaxis proteins. PAS domains usually
facilitate dimerization or higher-order oligomerization. Some PAS
folds bind small-molecule ligands such as metabolites, heme, and flavin
nucleotides to exert their physiological activities.,

Our recent mutational analysis indicates that the putative
PAS
domain of TraJF is essential for its homodimerization,
intracellular protein stability, and in vivo function. Mutation of multiple cysteine residues (Cys30,
Cys41, and Cys67) within the TraJF PAS domain significantly
inhibits F conjugation, which leads to the hypothesis that the TraJ
cysteines form a redox center for sensing oxidative stress. As most of the characterized single missense
mutations can significantly elevate the susceptibility of TraJF to proteolytic degradation by the protease–chaperone
pair HslVU, it was further hypothesized that oxidation of the TraJ
PAS domain might trigger HslVU-catalyzed degradation of TraJ, resulting
in repression of F plasmid-mediated bacterial conjugation.

To obtain structural insights into the
putative PAS domain of TraJ,
we subcloned and crystallized the N-terminal regions of TraJ from
the prototypic F plasmid and Salmonella enteric Serovar
Typhimurium virulence plasmid pSLT. The two structures, F plasmid
TraJ11–130 and pSLT TraJ1–128,
were determined at 1.55 and 1.67 Å resolution, respectively.
Both structures exhibit characteristic features of a PAS fold and
form homodimers through an extensive dimeric interface. Mutational
analysis revealed that residues forming the dimeric interface of TraJF11–130 are important for TraJ in activating
the traJ operon promoter PY, indicating
that homodimerization is required for TraJ function. Both the N-terminal
PAS domains of pSLT and R100 TraJ are fully active in replacing the
corresponding PAS domain of F plasmid TraJ, despite the fact that
each of these TraJ homologues is specific in activating its own cognate
PY, indicating that the allelic specificity of TraJ is
likely governed by its C-terminal domain. On the basis of these results,
we further discuss the role of TraJ dimerization in regulating the in vivo function of TraJ.

the 2.4 kb EcoRI–BamHI fragment
of pK184 to the 0.7 kb EcoRI–BamHI fragment of DNA amplified from pIZ2023
(a gift from J. Casadesus, Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain)
using JLU390 and JLU394 as primers. pJLJ003 was constructed by ligating
the 2.4 kb EcoRI–BamHI fragment
of pK184 to the 0.8 kb EcoRI–BamHI fragment of DNA amplified from plasmid

hybrid TraJ proteins TraJpSLT1–125:TraJF121–226 and TraJR1001–120:TraJF121–226, respectively. The PCR
primer pair of JLU390 and JLU391was used to amplify a fragment encoding
the plasmid pSLT TraJ N-terminal region (TraJpSLT1–125) from pJLJ002. The PCR primer pair of JLU330B and JLU347 was used
to amplify a fragment encoding the plasmid R100 TraJ N-terminal region
TraJR1001–120 from pJLJ003. The primer
pair of JLU346 and JLU308 was used to amplify a fragment containing
the F plasmid TraJ C-terminal region (TraJF121–226) from pJLJ001. The primer pair of JLU390
and JLU308 was used to amplify a pSLT-F hybrid traJ (encoding TraJpSLT1–125:TraJF121–226) fragment, which was further digested by EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pK184, resulting
in pJLJ004. The primer pair of JLU330B and JLU308 was used to amplify
an R100-F hybrid traJ (encoding TraJR1001–120:TraJF121–226) fragment, which was further digested by EcoRI
and BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pK184, resulting in pJLJ005.
The gene fragment of the pSLT TraJ PAS-like domain (TraJpSLT1–128) was PCR-amplified using genomic DNA from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium str. 14028S (gi: 267990107)
as a template and two primers: forward TraJA and backward TraJB. The
PCR product was cloned into vector pMCSG7 according to the ligation-independent cloning procedure,, resulting in pJSLT128. This vector introduces an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a TEV protease recognition site (Table S1
of the ).

Protein
Expression and Purification
To overexpress
His6-tagged TraJF11–130, BL21-DE3
cells containing pJLJ2829 were grown in 1 L of LB broth at 37 °C
while being vigorously shaken. After 3 h, IPTG was added to a final
concentration of 0.05 mM, and the culture was grown for an additional
16 h at 20 °C before cells were harvested by centrifugation.
The cell pellet was suspended in 80 mL of lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl,
10 mM imidazole, 250 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.0)] with one
tablet of Complete, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche
Applied Science). The suspension was lysed by sonication on ice for
3 min (30 s with a 30 s break, repeated six times) at maximal output.
After centrifugation at 27000g for 60 min, the supernatant
was loaded on a column with 2 mL of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated
with 20 mL of lysis buffer. After the sample had been washed with
30 mL of buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM imidazole, 250 mM NaCl, and
10% glycerol (pH 7.0)], the protein bound to the Ni-NTA agarose was
eluted with 10 mL of elution buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM imidazole,
250 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol (pH 7.0)] in 2 mL fractions. The fractions
containing His-tagged TraJF11–130 were
pooled and mixed with 300 units of AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) at
room temperature for 24 h to cleave the His6 tag. The digested
mixture was separated by size exclusion chromatography (Hiload 26/60
Superdex 75 prep grade column, Amersham Biosciences), and proteins
were eluted with SEC buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM NaCl, and 1 mM
dithiothreitol (pH 7.2)]. The peak containing pure TraJF11–130 was concentrated and buffer-exchanged to
0.5 M ammonium acetate, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
by using an Amicon ultracentrifuge filter (Millipore). Selenomethionyl
TraJF1–140 was overexpressed from plasmid
pJLJ2123 as previously described and
purified in the same manner as TraJF11–130. The protein concentration was determined by using BCA protein assays
(Pierce) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

E. coli BL21 cells containing pJSLT128 were grown with ampicillin
and kanamycin. A selenomethionine (SeMet) derivative of the expressed
protein was prepared and purified using Ni affinity chromatography
as described previously., Briefly, the harvested
cells, containing SeMet-labeled protein, were resuspended in lysis
buffer [500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mM
imidazole, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol], and the lysate was clarified
by centrifugation, filtered through a 0.44 μm membrane, and
applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Ni-NTA column (GE Health Systems) on an AKTAxpress
system (GE Health Systems). The His6-tagged protein was
removed by treatment with recombinant His7-tagged TEV protease
(a gift from D. Waugh, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD). Subtractive
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was used to remove the His6 tag, uncut protein, and His7-tagged TEV protease. The
protein of TraJ PAS-like domain was concentrated and exchanged into
crystallization buffer containing 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES (pH 8.0),
and 2 mM DTT through an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device. The
protein concentration was determined by using UV spectroscopy at 280
nm.

Crystallization and Data Collection
TraJF11–130 or selenomethionyl TraJF1–140 was concentrated to ∼3 mg/mL in 0.5 M ammonium
acetate, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM DTT. Crystals were obtained using
the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique with 3 μL of protein
mixed with 3 μL of the well solution at 4 °C for 3–6
weeks. The well solution containing 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4 and 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.5) was used for growing
both crystals, which were subsequently soaked in the well solution
with 25% glycerol for 20 min prior to being flash-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Data were collected from exposure of single crystals at
SIBYLS Beamline of the Advanced Light Source (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory, Berkeley, CA). A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected
in inverse-beam mode to 2.3 Å resolution for selenomethionyl
TraJF1–140 (SeMet-TraJF1–140), and a native data set was collected to 1.55
Å for TraJF11–130. Data were processed
and scaled using the HKL2000 package, and the statistics are listed
in Table S2 of the .

TraJpSLT1–128 at 30 mg/mL was crystallized using sitting drop vapor diffusion
at room temperature in a Crystal Quick VR 96-well round-bottom plate
(Greiner Bio-One North America). The protein solution (0.4 μL)
was mixed with 0.4 μL of crystallization reagent using the Mosquito
VR nanoliter liquid workstation (TTP LabTech) and allowed to equilibrate
against 135 μL of crystallization reagent. Four different crystallization
MCSG (the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics) screens (Microlytic)
were used: MCSG-1, MCSG-2, MCSG-3, and MCSG-4. The best crystals were
obtained under the 67th condition of MCSG-2 that contains 0.1 M dl-malic acid (pH 7.0) and 20% PEG 3500. Prior to data collection,
the crystals were cryoprotected using the solution prepared by adding
15% (v/v) glycerol to the crystallization condition and flash-cooled
in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline
19-ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source
(Argonne National Laboratory). Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion
(SAD) data at 0.9792 Å were collected from a single SeMet-labeled
protein crystal. The data were collected using SBCCOLLECT and processed
and scaled by the HKL3000 suite.

Determination
and Analysis of Structure
SOLVE located four expected selenium atoms in the
asymmetric unit using the 2.3 Å selenomethionyl TraJF1–140 MAD data. The best solution from SOLVE had
a Z score of 57.2 and a mean figure of merit of 0.3.
The maximum likelihood density modification in RESOLVE was used to improve initial phases, yielding
an overall figure of merit of phasing of 0.58. Automatic building
by RESOLVE using the protein sequence
generated a model with ∼200 residues built in an asymmetric
unit, which contain a homodimer of SeMet-TraJF1–140. The model was used for molecular replacement with MOLREP to generate a TraJF11–130 model from the TraJF11–130 native data
set at 3 Å, which was used as a starting model against the 1.55
Å TraJF11–130 native data set for
automated model building in ARP/wARP. Iterative runs of ARP/wARP combined with manual model building and
iterative cycles of refinement in REFMAC were used to complete and refine the model at 1.55 Å resolution.
The final model of the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains two
TraJF11–130 dimers. There was no interpretable
electron density for residues 10, 11, and 128–130. Refinement
statistics are summarized in Table .

The structure of TraJpSLT1–128 was
determined by SAD phasing using the HKL3000 suite. SHELXD was used for heavy atom search, and initial phases
were obtained from SHELXE. The heavy
atom sites were refined, and improved phases were calculated by iterations
of MLPHARE and DM. The initial protein models were built in ARP/wARP. Manual model rebuilding was conducted in COOT, and crystallographic refinement was performed
in PHENIX51. The final model refined
to 1.67 Å was evaluated by MolProbity and a Ramachandran plot
with good R and Rfree values and stereochemistry. There was no interpretable electron
density for N-terminal residues 1–13 and C-terminal residues
127 and 128. The details of the data collection, structure refinement,
and model quality are shown in Table S2 of the . The molecular structure figures were
prepared by using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org) with surface
of internal cavities created using HOLLOW (http://hollow.sourceforge.net). CASTp was used for calculating the area and volume of protein
internal cavities. Areaimol was used
for calculating the area of the protein contact surface.

TraJ in Vivo Activity Assays
Plasmid
pJLJ001 (constitutively expressing TraJF at close to physiological
levels) or one of its TraJF mutant derivatives was transformed
into an E. coli DH5α strain containing plasmid
pJLac101-PY (carrying an F plasmid PY-lacZ fusion). A fresh, single transformant was inoculated
into LB broth containing appropriate antibiotics and grown at 37 °C
while being shaken for 4 h to an OD600 between 0.5 and
1. The function of TraJF (or its mutant) in activating
PY is represented by the β-galactosidase activity
(LacZ activity) determined as described by Miller and reported as Miller units (MU) calculated using the
equation 1000[A420/(tvOD600)], where t is the time of reaction
(minutes) and v is the volume of culture added (milliliters).

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
All the primers and plasmids
used are listed in Table S1 of the . All missense mutations of traJ are generated as a derivative of plasmid pJLJ001 that constitutively
expresses wild-type TraJF close to physiological levels. L18A was constructed by ligating the 2.4 kb EcoRI–BamHI fragment of pK184 to
the 0.7 kb EcoRI–BamHI fragment
of DNA amplified from pJLJ001 using JLU349 and JLU308 as primers.
Site-directed mutagenesis through overlap extension was used to construct plasmids expressing TraJF-F105A and TraJF-Q116A. The primer pairs used for introducing
point mutations into TraJF are JLU350 and JLU351 for F105A
and JLU352 and JLU353 for Q116A. Primers JLU307 and JLU308 were used
with the primers listed above to amplify the mutated traJ DNA fragments, which were digested by EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into pK184, resulting in different pJLJ001
mutant derivatives.

Results
The N-Terminal Region of
TraJ Adopts a Conserved PAS Fold Structure
Our previous study
indicated that the N-terminal fragment of the
F plasmid TraJ, TraJF1–140, can be stably
overexpressed in E. coli. We crystallized and determined the structure of this domain (Table ). Better crystals were obtained with TraJF11–130 after deletion of the disordered regions
in the N- and C-termini of TraJF1–140, and its structure was further determined as the final model of
the TraJF PAS domain (Table ).
We also crystallized a related domain of TraJ from S. enterica Serovar Typhimurium virulence plasmid pSLT, TraJpSLT1–128, which shares ∼20% pairwise amino acid
sequence identity with its TraJF counterpart (Figure A). Both TraJF and TraJpSLT structures were independently determined using Se-methionine-substituted
proteins and anomalous scattering techniques, and each was refined
to high resolution [1.55 Å for TraJF and 1.67 Å
for TraJpSLT (see  and Table )].

TraJF11–130 and
TraJpSLT1–128. (A) Alignment of amino
acid sequences of TraJF11–130 and TraJpSLT1–128. Secondary structure elements of
TraJF11–130 and TraJpSLT1–128 are shown above and below the corresponding sequences,
respectively. Dotted lines indicate residues not modeled in the crystal
structures because of a lack of electron density. (B) Crystal structure
of a TraJF11–130 monomer. Secondary structural
elements as well as the N- and C-termini are labeled. (C) Crystal
structure of a TraJpSLT1–128 monomer.

Both the F and pSLT TraJ N-terminal
domains adopt PAS folds, characterized
by a highly conserved five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with
a 2-1-5-4-3 strand topology (Figure A–C)., An N-terminal
helix (A′α) and two or three less structurally conserved
helices are packed against the β-sheet on each side of both
PAS domains. In spite of the limited sequence similarity, the two
structures are nevertheless highly similar with an rmsd (root-mean-square
deviation) calculated on Cα atom positions of ∼2 Å.
On the basis of an rmsd of superimposed domains, the two TraJ PAS
domains are structurally more similar to one another than to any of
the other PAS domains deposited in the protein structure database.
The major difference between the two structures is that the TraJpSLT PAS lacks a helix corresponding to the D/Eα helix
of the TraJF PAS, and this region instead adopts a loop
that is more flexible with local B factors approximately
twice the overall B factor of the whole protein chain
(Figure B,C).

TraJ PAS Domains Form Homodimers
The TraJF PAS domain crystallographic asymmetric unit
contains four protomers
that are arranged as a pair of nearly identical dimers (Figure A). The asymmetric unit of the TraJpSLT PAS domain contains only a single protomer; however, a crystallographic
2-fold structure generates a dimer that can virtually be superimposed
on the TraJF PAS dimer (Figure B). In the conserved TraJ dimer packing, one protomer is offset from
the other by ∼120°. The dimer interface is stabilized
by both the coiled coil formed by the N-terminal helices (A′α)
and interactions between the conserved β-sheets, which is consistent
with other known structures of the PAS domain dimers. Each TraJF11–130 molecule has ∼1600 Å2 of its ∼5600 Å2 total surface area
buried at the dimeric interface, whereas ∼1800 Å2 of the ∼6100 Å2 total surface area of TraJpSLT1–128 is involved in dimeric contacts.

TraJpSLT1–128. The two protomers of each
dimer are colored differently. (A) Crystal structure of a TraJF11–130 dimer. (B) Superposition of the TraJF11–130 (green) and TraJpSLT1–128 (blue) dimers. (C) TraJF11–130 residues surrounding DTD (shown as spheres) at the dimeric interface.
The surface of the internal pocket is colored red. (D) Residues surrounding
a small cavity at the dimeric interface of TraJpSLT1–128. (E) Position of the DTD (spheres) pocket in the
overall structure of a TraJF11–130 dimer.

In both structures, there is an
internal cavity enclosed in the
dimeric interface of the PAS domain (Figure C,D). In the TraJF11–130 structure,
the cavity has a total surface area of ∼367 Å2 and a buried volume of ∼370 Å3, and it also
contains an artificial ligand, DTD (dithiane diol, oxidized DTT) (Figure C,E and Figure S2 and Results of the ). The cavity formed by
TraJpSLT1–128 dimerization is smaller
and contains no density corresponding to DTD in spite of the fact
that DTT was used during protein purification (Figure D). It appears that Tyr27 of TraJpSLT1–128 (corresponding to Ile22 of TraJF11–130) from both protomers partially occludes the pocket, resulting in
a smaller buried volume (∼103 Å3). Despite
our efforts (see Results and Figures S3 and S4 of the ), we were unable to determine
if a specific physiological ligand exists in the pocket to regulate
TraJ dimerization or its in vivo function.

Mutations
That Affect the PAS Domain and Dimerization of TraJF
We have previously characterized a large collection
of missense mutations in TraJF, which were selected from
error-prone PCR mutagenesis based on their deleterious effects on
activation of the plasmid PY promoter. All of these mutations are clustered in either an N-terminal
region (residues 21–117) or a C-terminal region (residues 150–219),
roughly overlapping the PAS domain and the putative helix–turn–helix
DNA-binding domain, respectively (Figure S1 of the ). Each of the N-terminal mutations
affects the intracellular stability, dimerization, and in
vivo function of TraJF, suggesting that these
features of TraJF are intrinsically related. The structure of TraJF11–130 revealed that most of those functionally conserved N-terminal residues
are involved in proper folding of the domain (Figure A). Residues Cys30, Phe38, Phe45, Phe49, Ala56, Leu60, Ile70,
Val91, Ile93, Trp98, Ile100, Trp115, and Phe117 pack within the hydrophobic
core of an individual PAS fold. Residues Ile22, Ile31, and Leu114
are involved in hydrophobic interactions between the conserved N-terminal
helix (A′α) and the β-sheet of the PAS fold. The
four functionally conserved hydrophilic residues (Arg32, Lys37, Ser62,
and Arg96) are surface-exposed and are involved in hydrogen bonding
or electrostatic interactions with nearby residues and also likely
stabilize the fold.

Functionally deleterious mutations in TraJF11–130 reveal conserved structural components.
(A) Mapping of deleterious
missense mutations (spheres) onto the TraJF11–130 dimer. The two protomers are colored green and yellow. See Figure
S1 of the  for the
identity of the missense mutations. (B) Stereoview of the dimerization
interface of the TraJF PAS domain formed by interactions
between the N-terminal helices (A′α) and the β-sheets
from both protomers. Water molecules are represented by red spheres.

Among residues that make direct
contacts with the partner protomer
across the dimerization interface of TraJF11–130 (Figure B), only one (Val21) was identified
as being functionally important in our previous screen. Val21 not
only mediates coiled-coil interactions between A′α helices
of the two protomers but also interacts with Phe105 in Hβ of
the partner protomer. This explains the fact that substitution of
Val21 with a negatively charged aspartic acid leads to a &gt;20-fold
decrease in TraJF activity. To further probe the physiological relevance of the conserved dimeric
interface of TraJ PAS domains, we generated less disruptive alanine
mutations at three residues (Leu18, Phe105, and Gln116) and assayed
the ability of the TraJF mutants to activate the PY promoter (Table  and Figure B). Leu18 appears to be involved in coiled-coil
interactions between A′α helices across the partner protomers,
and the L18A mutation modestly inhibited PY transcription.
The benzyl rings of Phe105 from Hβ of each protomer form intimate
hydrophobic interactions with A′α helices of the partner
protomer, and the F105A mutation reduced the activity of TraJF by &gt;6-fold. The side chains of Gln116 from both protomers
are part of the hydrogen bonding network across the dimerization interface
also involving Gln103, Tyr118, and two water molecules. The Q116A
mutation reduced the activity of TraJF by ∼50%.
These results indicate that the dimeric interface observed in the
crystal structure of TraJF11–130 is relevant
for the TraJ in vivo function.

Functional Interchangeability of the TraJ
PAS Domains in the
F Family of Conjugative Plasmids
A recent study indicates
that F-like plasmid R1 TraJ (TraJR1) shares a certain level
of functional interchangeability with TraJpSLT but not
with TraJF or another F-like plasmid R100 TraJ (TraJR100). To further test the allelic
specificity of different TraJ proteins, we assessed the ability of
TraJ from F, pSLT, and R100 to drive transcription from an F PY-lacZ fusion reporter plasmid, pJLac101-PY. Each of the TraJ proteins was
expressed from the pK184 expression plasmid such that each was produced
at close to physiological levels. The
results showed that only TraJF activated F plasmid PY whereas neither pSLT or R100 TraJ was able to activate transcription
above the level of the traJ control, suggesting that
each TraJ homologue is functionally specific to its own cognate plasmid
(Table ).

The ability of different TraJ proteins
to activate PY was determined in E. coli cells containing a corresponding TraJ construct (from pJLJ001 to
pJLJ005) and the F plasmid PY-lacZ fusion
reporter plasmid pJLac101-PY as described in . The LacZ activity shown is the average
of results from two independent samples. As a negative control, pJLJ2729
(a pJLJ001 derivative missing the C-terminal region of the F plasmid traJ) has a LacZ activity of 43 ± 3 MU.

To determine which function domain
of TraJ carries this allelic
specificity, we performed a domain swapping experiment based on the
amino acid sequence and structural alignments of the F family TraJ
homologues (Figure A and Figure S1 of the ). We replaced the PAS
domain in the F plasmid TraJ with the PAS domain of pSLT or R100 TraJ
to test the ability of the hybrid TraJ to activate F plasmid PY in pJLac101-PY (Table ). Interestingly, both the hybrid versions of TraJ (TraJpSLT1–125:TraJF121–226 and TraJR1001–120:TraJF121–226) activated the F plasmid PY at levels
comparable to that of the F plasmid TraJ, indicating that the allelic
specificity of the F family plasmid TraJ lies in its C-terminal functional
domain that includes a putative HTH DNA-binding motif whereas the
PAS domains of TraJ homologues are functionally interchangeable in
spite of their limited amino acid sequence homology.

Discussion
Consistent with previous bioinformatics analysis,, the X-ray crystal structures of TraJF11–130 and TraJpSLT1–128 presented here indicate
that the F family TraJ proteins contain structurally similar N-terminal
PAS domains despite limited amino acid sequence homology (Figure  and Figure S1 of the ). TraJ proteins also homodimerize similarly, forming
an extensive dimeric interface (Figure ).
The observed structural details of the TraJF110–130 PAS fold and its dimeric interface are fully supported by extensive
mutational and functional analysis (Figure  and Table ). Although F, R100, and pSLT
TraJ appear to activate only their cognate tra operon
promoters, the PAS domains of these TraJ homologues are functionally
interchangeable (Table ), indicating that
the allelic specificity of F family TraJ is carried by only the region
C-terminal to the PAS domain. Because the C-terminal domain is thought
to act as a DNA-binding domain, our finding
suggests that plasmid specificity is governed at the level of protein–DNA
interactions, whereas the PAS domain might be dedicated to regulatory
functions, possibly in response to cellular signals, as signal sensing
is a common feature in many known PAS domains.

In the crystal structures of both TraJF11–130 and TraJpSLT1–128, there is an internal
pocket formed at the dimer interface (Figure ). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of
an internal pocket formed through homodimerization of a PAS domain.
While some PAS domains have ligand-binding pockets as part of their
signaling function, these ligands commonly bind within a single PAS
unit., We were unable to determine whether there
is a specific physiological ligand in the TraJ PAS dimer pocket to
regulate its function (see Results and Figures S3 and S4 of the ); however, we cannot rule
out the possibility that a small-molecule ligand may regulate TraJ
PAS dimerization in response to environmental cues.

PAS domains
promote oligomerization of many proteins, and it has
been hypothesized that signal-induced changes in protein quaternary
structure are involved in the signal transduction function of many
PAS proteins. A previous study suggested
that multiple cysteines in TraJ could be part of a metal-containing
redox center to regulate transcription of the tra operon in response to oxidative pressure. The crystal structures of TraJF11–130 and TraJpSLT1–128 reveal that these
cysteines do not interact with one another or metal ligands (Figure A and Figure S1 of the ), and therefore, it is unlikely that they coordinate
with a metal ion to form a redox center. Instead, these cysteines
in the observed structures pack separately in the hydrophobic core
of the PAS domain, explaining the previous observation that mutation
of Cys30 to a serine or a tryptophan severely affects protein stability,
dimerization, and in vivo function of TraJF.

TraJ PAS domains dedicate a
large surface area to homodimerization
(Figure ), and all dimerization-defective
TraJF missense mutants that we have identified previously
are significantly more sensitive than wild-type TraJF to
proteolytic degradation by the HslVU protease–chaperone pair in vivo.We hypothesize that
folding of the TraJ PAS domain relies on its dimerization. Cellular
signals could potentially modulate TraJ dimerization and therefore
influence the susceptibility of TraJ to HslVU, providing a mechanism
for regulating cellular TraJ levels and tra operon
activity.
