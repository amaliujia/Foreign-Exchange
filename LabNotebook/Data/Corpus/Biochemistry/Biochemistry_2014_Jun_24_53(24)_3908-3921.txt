Rapid progress in the mechanistic
study of several human neurodegenerative diseases has revealed a potentially
common mode of pathogenesis: that small, soluble oligomers of misfolded
proteins, rather than much larger, insoluble fibrous deposits, play
the principal role in initiating and propagating neuronal injury.
Examples of this reinterpretation have emerged from the study of α-synuclein
in Parkinson’s disease, huntingtin in Huntington’s disease,
and amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Studies of the latter disorder have accrued the most evidence
for the pathogenic oligomer hypothesis of neurodegeneration. Soluble
oligomers of Aβ ranging from dimers to dodecamers and somewhat
larger assemblies have been shown to impair synaptic structure and
function in both cell culture and animal models (for example, refs (−)).

Because therapeutic approaches to AD and other protein misfolding
disorders could benefit from selectively targeting soluble neurotoxic
protein oligomers, it has become increasingly important to identify
the full range of pathogenic forms of the respective proteins. In
1995, we reported the first example of a cell culture model (7PA2
cells: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing Val717Phe human amyloid protein precursor (APP)) in which the
secretion of 4 kDa Aβ monomers was accompanied by the secretion
of ∼8.5–12.5 kDa Aβ-immunoreactive species that,
by immunochemical analysis and radiosequencing, had the properties
of dimers and trimers of Aβ. Subsequently,
we and others showed that the latter larger species (but not the monomers)
released by the 7PA2 cells could disrupt hippocampal long-term potentiation
(LTP),,, decrease dendritic
spine density,, inhibit synaptic vesicle recycling, facilitate hippocampal long-term depression, and impair the memory of a learned behavior
in adult rodents.−

Despite this evidence that low-n Aβ oligomers in the
7PA2 cell conditioned medium (CM) produce multiple neural effects
analogous to some key features of AD, the precise molecular identity
of the oligomers has not been established. This is in large part due
to the technical difficulties in purifying the low (subnanomolar)
quantities of soluble Aβ oligomers in the CM of these cells
and then successfully ionizing the hydrophobic oligomers during mass
spectrometry in order to identify their exact masses. In the current
work, we have used a range of biochemical, immunochemical, and mass
spectrometric methods to analyze the Aβ species produced in
this highly useful and rather widely used cell culture model. Two
principal findings have emerged: (1) that the ∼8 kDa species
has a mass indicating that it is a noncovalently bonded dimer of Aβ,
as originally hypothesized, and (2) that there are also Aβ-immunoreactive
species in the CM which represent Aβ monomers that bear sequences
which are N-terminally extended (NTE) beyond the conventional Aβ
Asp1 start site. We designate these novel species as NTE-Aβ.
We show that while both authentic noncovalent dimers and the NTE-Aβ
peptides can impair synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, NTE-Aβ
species are much more abundant than Aβ dimers in the particular
CHO cell line we employ. Importantly, treatment of the cells with
pharmacological inhibitors of β-secretase caused increased processing
of APP via this alternative pathway, producing more synaptotoxic NTE-Aβ
peptides. Our findings extend the range of Aβ-containing APP
peptides that are capable of impairing synaptic function and suggest
that synaptotoxicity can arise from APP processing events in addition
to the classical β- and γ-secretase cleavages that produce
Aβ.

Experimental Procedures
Reagents
Unless otherwise stated,
all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and were of the highest purity available. Synthetic
Aβ(1–40) was synthesized and purified by Dr. James I.
Elliott at Yale University and was &gt;99% pure. The β-secretase
inhibitors N-(1S,2R)-1-benzyl-3-(cyclopropylamino)-2-hydroxypropyl)-5-(methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino-N′-((1R)-1-phenylethyl)isophthalamide
(Compound IV) and H-EVNstatineVAEF-NH2 (Compound III) were from Calbiochem
(Billerica, MA). The γ-secretase inhibitors (2S)-2-{[(3,5-difluorophenyl)acetyl]amino}-N-[(3S)-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]propanamide (Compound E) and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine tert-butyl ester (DAPT)
were gifts of Dr. Mike Wolfe (Center for Neurologic Diseases).

7PA2 and
Flp-In CHO Cell Lines Bearing Mutant Human APP
Cell culture
media, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and media supplements were from Invitrogen.
Naïve, untransfected CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and
2 mM l-glutamine. CHO cells stably transfected with human
APP751 bearing the V717F mutation (7PA2 cells) were grown
in CHO medium plus G418 (200 μg/mL). Isogenic CHO cell lines
stably expressing human APP695 with the wild type sequence
or bearing one of the following coding changes (i) Lys595Asn, (ii)
Met596Leu, or (iii) Met596Val were generated using the Flp-In (Invitrogen).
Briefly, naïve CHO cells were transfected with the pFRT/lacZeo
vector using lipofectamine 2000, and cells stably expressing β-galactosidase
selected in medium supplemented with zeocin (0.1 mg/mL) and a clonal
cell line (referred to as pCHO-) were isolated by limiting dilution.
DNA encoding APP695 was cloned into pcDNA5/FRT and PCR
site-directed mutagenesis used to introduce single base changes resulting
in desired mutations at APP595 or APP596. The
pOG44 plasmid and pcDNA5/FRT-APP vectors were cotransfected into the
pCHO- host cell line. Flp-In cells stably expressing human APP were
selected using hygromycin (0.5 mg/mL) and confirmed to lack β-galactosidase
activity and to express human APP.

For conditioning, cells were
allowed to reach 90–100% confluency, washed once with unsupplemented
DMEM (5 mL), and incubated for ∼15 h in DMEM (5 mL). CM was
collected and spun at 200g and 4 °C for 10 min
to remove cellular debris, the upper 4.5 mL removed, and centrifuged
a second time (3000g, 10 min, 4 °C) to pellet
particulate debris. To inhibit proteolysis, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was added to achieve
a final concentration of 50 mM and CM used immediately or stored at
−80 °C pending use. Storing CM at −80 °C does not
alter the profile of 6E10-reactive material immunoprecipitated by
either AW8 or R1282.

Immunoprecipitation (IP) of Cell Medium
Samples were
first incubated with 30 μL of a 1:1 mixture of protein A sepharose
(PAS) and protein G agarose (PAG) (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 6
h at 4 °C. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation at 3500g for 10 min and the cleared supernatant incubated with
appropriate antibody (Table ) plus 30 μL
of PAS/PGA and rocked on a nutator for 12–14 h at 4 °C.
Antibody–antigen complexes were collected and pellets washed
as described previously.

Polyacrylamide
Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western Blotting
Immunoprecipitated
(IP’d) proteins were released from the antibody complex by
heating at 100 °C in 2× sample buffer and then electrophoresed
on either hand poured 16% polyacrylamide tris-tricine gels or precast
4–12% polyacrylamide NuPAGE bis-tris gels from Invitrogen. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes at 400 mA for 2 h and then microwaved in 200 mL of PBS at
800 W for 90 s ×2. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature
in TBST containing 5% (w/v) skim milk and then incubated with antibody
(Table ) for 1 h at room temperature or 12
h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed 6 times for 10 min with PBS
containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with goat
antimouse infrared 800 antibody or antirabbit 800 infrared antibody
(Rockland, Gilbertville, PA) diluted in PBST containing 0.01% (w/v)
SDS. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using a Li-COR Odyssey infrared
imaging system (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE).

Western Blot Analysis of
Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Isolated 7PA2 Fractions
Fourteen milliliter aliquots of 7PA2 CM were concentrated ∼10-fold
(1.4 mL) using Centriprep Ultracel YM-3 filters (Millipore, Carrigtwohill,
Co. Cork, Ireland) and concentrates used immediately or stored at
4 °C for ≤24 h prior to use. One milliliter of 10-fold
concentrated 7PA2 CM was chromatographed on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL
(Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) eluted in 50 mM ammonium
acetate at pH 8.5 at a flow-rate of 0.8 mL/min using an AKTA purifier
(GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). One milliliter fractions
were collected, lyophilized, then resuspended in 20 μL of sample
buffer and used for Western blotting.

Purification of Aβ
from 7PA2 CM
After considerable experimentation, a 4-step
purification strategy was implemented (Figures  and ). The first step involved the removal
of soluble APP (APPs) from 7PA2 CM using DE23 cellulose. This was achieved by adding
DE23 cellulose (0.5 mL settled volume in DMEM) to 5 mL of 7PA2 CM
and gently rocking for 30 min at room temperature. The APP-depleted
CM was separated from the DE23 cellulose using a 0.2 μM stericup
vacuum filter unit (Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Co. Cork, Ireland).
Thereafter, the supernatant was incubated with a 60 μL suspension
of either (1) AW8 conjugated to PAS or (2) 2G3/21F12 conjugated to
PGA (Figure ) and gently mixed for 12 h at
4 °C. Beads were sedimented by centrifugation (3500g for 10 min at 4 °C) and washed using STEN buffers. Bound proteins were eluted by resuspending the
beads in 100 mM NH4OH (200 μL) and vortex mixing
for 2 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a clean tube, snap
frozen, and lyophilized. Samples were resuspended in 20 mM ammonium
acetate at pH 8.5 (buffer A, 5 mL) and used for ligand affinity chromatography.
Briefly, 30 mg of methanol-washed dry KLVFFAE-Ac-HN-(CH2)3-CPG beads (Senexis Limited, Cambridge, UK) was added to the immunopurified
7PA2 preparation and incubated with gentle agitation for 30 min. Beads
were recovered by centrifugation (3000g, 5 min) and
washed with 5% acetonitrile in buffer A (5 mL × 3) and then eluted
using 20% acetonitrile in buffer A (5 mL). The sample was then lyophilized
and immediately prior to SEC dissolved in 50 mM ammonium acetate at
pH 8.5 (1 mL), and applied to a Superdex 75 column and eluted as describe
above. Half milliliter fractions were collected, an aliquot taken
for LTP experiments, and the remainder lyophilized and used for Western
blot and silver stain analysis.

Silver Staining and In-Gel
Digestion of Excised SDS– Polyacrylamide Bands for Liquid Chromatography
(LC) MALDI-TOF
Electrophoresed proteins were detected using
the protocol of Shevchenko et al. and
bands of interest excised using a clean razor blade. Excised bands
were cut into ∼1 mm pieces and silver stain removed by incubating
the pieces in 500 μL of a 1:1 mixture of Silverquest Silver
Stain Kit destaining reagents A and B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
for 3 h. Gel pieces were washed briefly with distilled water (500
μL × 2) and then 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate in 50% ACN
(500 μL × 2) for 30 min. Gel pieces were completely dehydrated
by incubation in 100% ACN (500 μL) for 20 min and samples reduced
to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge.

For trypsin digests, 200
ng of porcine trypsin (20 μL, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was
used to rehydrate the gel pieces. The suspension was incubated for
3 h at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of
1% formic acid (10 μL). For LysC digestions, 200 ng of endoproteinase
LysC (20 μL) was used to rehydrate the gel pieces. Digests were
incubated overnight at 30 °C and the reaction stopped with 1%
formic acid (10 μL). Samples were then bath sonicated for 30
min and 15 μL injected onto a 75 μm × 30 cm column
(New Objective, Woburn, MA, USA) packed with a Magic C18 AQ stationary
phase (Michrom Biosciences, Auburn, CA, USA) connected to a Michrom
Magic 2002 capillary HPLC (Michrom Biosciences, Auburn, CA, USA).
Samples were eluted using a linear gradient of 0.1% aqueous formic
acid to 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic over 50 min. Peaks
corresponding to tryptic peptides were subjected to nanospray ionization
and analyzed using a Quadrupole-Time of Flight mass spectrometer (QStar,
Thermo Electron Corp, San Jose, CA, USA).

In Vivo LTP
Adult
male Wistar rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of urethane (1.5 g/kg), and a cannula was implanted in the lateral
cerebral ventricle 1 mm lateral to the midline and 4 mm below the
surface of the dura mater. Single pathway recordings of excitatory
post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) were recorded from the stratum radiatum
in the CA1 area of the dorsal hippocampus in response to stimulation
of the ipsilateral Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway. EPSPs were evoked at a frequency of 0.033 Hz.
Test EPSPs were stimulated to give 50% of the maximum amplitude. High
frequency stimulation (HFS) to induce LTP consisted of 10 trains of
20 stimuli with an intertrain interval of 2 s and an interstimulus
interval of 5 ms (200 Hz). During HFS, the stimulation intensity was
adjusted to produce an EPSP ≥75% of the maximum amplitude.
Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of the sample was made 10 min prior
to HFS and solutions injected at ∼5 μL per min (total
volume 10 μL).

Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis of 7PA2
CM SEC Isolated Fractions
7PA2 CM was concentrated ∼10-fold
using a Centriprep Ultracel YM-3 filter and then used for SEC as in
Figures B and A. Fractions
8, 9, and 10 were pooled to a give a preparation rich in Aβ
immunoreactive species of masses between ∼14 and 4 kDa. This
material was then lyophilized, reconstituted in 125 μL of rehydration
buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, and 0.2% (v/v) Pharmalyte,
3–10) (GE Healthcare) and electrofocused on immobilized pH
gradient (IPG) strips (pH 4–7) (GE Healthcare). After focusing
was complete, IPG strips were incubated with 6 mL of SDS-equilibration
buffer (6 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 2% (w/v) SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and
0.01% (w/v) phenol red) in a 15 mL tube for 15 min and then placed
on top of a 4–12% bis-tris gel. The IPG gel was secured in
position with agarose dissolved in running buffer so that the IPG
gel could be in contact the stacking gel. Molecular weight markers
were loaded in a well next to the IPG strip. Gels were electrophoresed
at 50 V for 10 min, and then the voltage was increased to 120 V for
2.5 h. The IPG strip was removed from the top of the gel and proteins
in the gel transferred onto nitrocellulose and Western blotted using
6E10 as described above and in Table .

Western
Blot and Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage Analysis of SEC-Isolated 7PA2 Fractions
Concentrated 7PA2 CM was chromatographed on a Superdex 75 column
and fractions collected as described above. Then fractions 8 and 9
(designated as Oligo), and fraction 10 (designated as Mono) were lyophilized
in separate microcentrifuge tubes. Lyophilizates were dissolved in
30 μL of 70% formic acid ±0.1 M CNBr. Tubes were capped under nitrogen, vortexed, and
then spun gently to move solutions to the bottom of the tubes. Samples
were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 h, after which
330 μL of Milli-Q water was added and the contents frozen and
lyophilized. Dry samples were reconstituted in 2× sample buffer
sample, electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide bis-tris gels, and proteins
transferred onto nitrocellulose and Western blotted as described above.

In Vitro LTP
Brains from ∼6–8 week old C57BL/6x129
mice were quickly removed and submerged in ice-cold oxygenated cutting
solution. Transverse slices (350 μm
thick) were cut with a vibroslicer from the middle portion of each
hippocampus. Slices were then incubated in artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (ACSF), subsequently transferred to a recording chamber, and
continuously perfused at RT (∼24 °C) with 9 mL of ACSF
saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Field EPSPs
(fEPSP) were recorded in the CA1 region of hippocampus induced by
test stimuli at 0.05 Hz with an intensity that elicited an fEPSP amplitude
of 40–50% of maximum. Once a stable baseline was achieved,
1 mL of test medium was added to the perfusion bath and the slice
incubated for a further 20 min prior to stimulation. Thereafter, LTP
was induced by two consecutive trains (1 s) of stimuli at 100 Hz.

Results
Medium Conditioned by 7PA2 Cells Contain Aβ-Immunoreactive
Species Which Migrate on SDS–PAGE and Elute from Size Exclusion
with Molecular Weights Consistent with Aβ Monomers, Dimers,
and Trimers
7PA2 cells stably express human APP751 bearing the V717F familial AD mutation and secrete significant amounts
of APP metabolites into their medium.,, Since the total amount of ELISA-detectable Aβ
secreted by these cells is in the low to subnanomolar range, immunoprecipitation (IP) with polyclonal pan
anti-Aβ antibodies has been widely used to concentrate and facilitate
the detection of 7PA2 Aβ (reviewed in ref ()). Here, we show that when
7PA2 CM is IP’d with AW8 and Western blotted with anti-Aβ
monoclonal antibodies, a ladder of bands between ∼3 and ∼16
kDa is detected (Figure A). Specifically,
AW8 captures ∼4.5, 5.8, 8.5/9 (a doublet) and ∼12.5
kDa species that react with N-terminal (6E10), midregion (4G8), and
C-terminal (2G3 and 21F12) anti-Aβ antibodies (Figure A). It should be noted that in these IP/Western
blot experiments, nonspecific high molecular weight bands are observed
in the CM of both 7PA2 and CHO cells, most of which are due to the
detection of the IP antibody by the secondary antibody used for immunoblotting.

7PA2 conditioned
medium contains Aβ-immunoreactive species which migrate on SDS–PAGE
with molecular weights consistent for Aβ monomer, dimers, and
trimers. (A) Conditioned medium from 7PA2 and untransfected CHO cells
(3 mL per lane) were IP’d with the pan anti-Aβ polyclonal
antibody, AW8, and then Western blotted using the antibodies indicated
at the top of each panel. M, D, and T denote the position where putative
Aβ monomer, dimer, and trimer species migrate. p3 refers to
the well-known ∼3 kDa product of α-/γ-secretase
cleavage that is detected by 2G3 and 21F12. (B and C) 1 mL of 10×
concentrated 7PA2 CM was chromatographed on a Superdex 75 column,
fractions collected, lyophilized, and used for SDS–PAGE and
Western blotting (B) or silver stain (C). The migrations of SDS–PAGE
molecular weight standards (in kDa) are indicated on the left, and
elution of linear dextran SEC standards of 9.9 and 4.4 kDa are indicated
by vertical arrows.

Importantly, when 7PA2
CM is subjected to native SEC, Aβ-immunoreactive species elute
with molecular weights consistent with estimates made using denaturing
SDS–PAGE (Figure B), that is, with
sizes indicative of Aβ monomer, dimers, and trimers. In prior
studies, we found that the plasticity-disrupting activity of 7PA2
CM was present in SEC fractions that contain the ∼8.5/9 and
∼12.5 kDa species.,, However, silver staining of the same SEC fractions demonstrates
that the proteins recognized by anti-Aβ antibodies contribute
only a small portion of the total proteins present (Figure C). Thus, in order to definitively ascribe bioactivity
to the ∼8.5/9 and ∼12.5 kDa Aβ-reactive species,
we sought to purify these species to homogeneity, test their effect
on LTP, and determine their primary sequence by mass spectrometry.

Purification of an SDS-Stable Aβ Dimer from the 7PA2 Conditioned
Medium
In order to identify methods suitable for purifying
Aβ species from 7PA2 CM, numerous chromatographies were tested
for their ability to bind Aβ and remove extraneous proteins,
as assessed by IP/WB and qualitative silver staining. The chromatographies
tested included (1) hydrophobic interaction, (2) diol normal phase,
(3) PCM cation exchange, (4) C18 reverse-phase, (5) MonoQ anion-exchange,
(6) DE23 anion-exchange, (7) immunoaffinity capture, and (8) ligand-binding.
The first three chomatographies showed little affinity for Aβ
and were not investigated further, and various combinations of C18,
anion-exchange, immunoaffinity, and ligand binding were tested. After
extensive testing, the four-step protocol outlined in Figure A produced the best yield
and highest purity of Aβ species and comprised the (1) removal
of large amounts of soluble APP (APPs); (2) use of immunoaffinity
methods to enrich Aβ species; (3) use of a peptide ligand (KLVFFAE)
as a homotypic Aβ affinity reagent; (4) separation of the resultant
Aβ assemblies by size-exclusion chromatography; and then electrophoresis
of the SEC fractions on SDS–PAGE. Step 2 used either protein-A-sepharose-coupled
AW8 antiserum (AW8-PAS) (Figure ) or protein-G-agarose-coupled
2G3/21F12 (2G3/21F12-PGA), both of which yielded similar results (compare
Figure B and C to D and E). 6E10 Western blotting
of material purified as outlined in Figure A revealed that the ∼4.5 kDa monomer and the ∼8.5 kDa
dimer elute in SEC fractions 16–22 and 14–21, respectively,
with peak levels of monomers and dimers in fractions 20 and 17, respectively
(Figure B). Silver staining of these fractions
showed peaks of total protein tracking with immunoreactivity (Figure C). Similar results were obtained when 2G3/21F12-PGA
was used as the immunoaffinity reagent (Figure E). Compared to the greater amounts of Aβ purified by AW8-PAS,
the ∼4.5 and ∼8.5 kDa species purified by 2G3/21F12-PGA
eluted in a smaller number of SEC fractions: 16–17 and 18–22
for the monomer and dimer, respectively.

Multistep protocol for
the purification of cell-derived, soluble Aβ monomers and dimers.
(A) The flowchart illustrates the order of individual chromatographic
steps. Steps 1–3 were carried out sequentially in batch mode,
beginning with 5 mL of 7PA2 CM. The products of 10 such 3-step experiments
were then pooled and used for the final SEC fractionation (step 4).
Results for experiments using AW8 for immunocapture are shown in B
and C, and those using 2G3/21F12 are shown in D and E. (B and D) Final
SEC fractions were lyophilized and analyzed by Western blot using
6E10 (30% of each 0.5 mL fraction) and silver stain (60% of each 0.5
mL fraction). The first lane in B and D is an AW8 IP of the starting
(unmanipulated) 7PA2 CM, whereas the first lane in C and E is a direct
load of 20 μL of the same CM. The indicated amounts of synthetic
Aβ1–40 were loaded to allow estimation of the amount
of Aβ recovered in the SEC fractions. M, D, and T denote the
position where putative Aβ monomer, dimer, and trimer species
migrate, and the migrations of molecular weight standards (in kDa)
are indicated on the left.

Each purification started with 50 mL of CM, and 30% of the
final SEC fractions were used for the 6E10 immunoblot. Comparison
of starting material and purified material indicates the excellent
recovery of the monomer, reasonable recovery of the dimer, and no
recovery of the trimer.

Mass Spectrometry of Purified, Cell-Secreted
Aβ Indicates the Presence of SDS-Stable Dimers Composed of Two
Unmodified Aβ1–40 Monomers
The ∼4.5 and
∼8.5 kDa species purified from 7PA2 CM as described in Figure  were excised from silver-stained polyacrylamide
gels, digested with proteases, and used for matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS). Liquid chromatography-separated tryptic digests of the ∼4.5
kDa monomer band produced peaks with masses consistent with the expected
products of trypsin-cleaved Aβ1–40, that is, Aβ1–5,
Aβ6–16, Aβ17–28, and Aβ29–40
(with a methionine35 sulfoxide) (Figure A,B; Table ). These results
are in keeping with the fact that Aβ1–40 is the predominant
Aβ peptide secreted by 7PA2 cells and that peptides with other
C-termini are only present at low levels., Importantly, tryptic digests of the ∼8.5 kDa band also produced
mass peaks corresponding to Aβ fragments 1–5, 17–28,
and 29–40 (methionine-sulfoxide) (Figure C; Table ); however, Aβ6–16
was not identified. Detection of the 6–16 fragment is crucial
to discriminate between noncovalently and covalently cross-linked
dimers. Under certain circumstances, Aβ can be induced to form
covalently linked dimers, either by phenolic coupling of tyrosine10− or by formation of an intermolecular isopeptide bond between Lys16
and Gln15., In both these types of cross-linked
dimers, tryptic digestion would not yield the 6–16 fragment
released from the Aβ monomer but instead would give rise to
much larger fragments. The failure to detect Aβ6–16 from
trypsin digests of the ∼8.5 kDa band (Figure C) could have been due to difficulty recovering that fragment
from HPLC or due to a cross-link within it. To address both possibilities,
we employed an alternate digestion protocol. LysC selectively cleaves
the C-terminal to lysine residues and should generate the longer 1–16
fragment of Aβ from a noncovalent dimer. When the four-step
purified, gel-extracted ∼8.5 kDa Aβ species is analyzed
in this way, the 1–16 fragment is observed, along with the
17–28 and methionine35-oxidized 29–40 fragments (Figure D; Table ; and Figure S2, ), thus confirming the
identity of the purified ∼8.5 kDa band as a noncovalently linked
dimer of Aβ1–40. It is important to note that the sort
of MALDI-TOF MS used here is not quantitative; it demonstrates the
presence of dimers formed from Aβ1–40 but does not provide
information about their abundance.

Purified Aβ Dimer from 7PA2 Medium
Inhibits LTP in Vivo
To confirm that the bona fide Aβ
dimers purified from 7PA2 medium (above) perturb synapse physiology,
the purified dimer was tested for its ability to inhibit LTP in vivo
upon intracerebroventricular microinjection
in healthy adult rats. This icv approach was taken
because it requires only small sample volumes (≤10 μL)
and because we have previously shown that injection of both whole
7PA2 CM and dimer-rich SEC fractions thereof disrupt LTP., High frequency stimulation (HFS) of the hippocampal Schaffer collateral
pathway fibers in rats that had received the vehicle resulted in the
expected induction of LTP that persisted for the course of the experiment
(145 ± 10% at 3 h post-HFS relative to baseline EPSP amplitude)
(Figure E, black). In contrast, when rats
were injected with the purified Aβ dimer (of estimated concentration
between 0.25 and 2.5 pM), a marked and statistically significant decrease
in the EPSP amplitude was observed (103 ± 3%, p &lt; 0.05 at 3 h post-HFS) (Figure E, red).
These results clearly demonstrate that a purified, cell-derived Aβ
dimer confirmed by mass spectrometry inhibits LTP in vivo at subnanomolar
concentrations in the absence of other factors.

7PA2 Cells
Also Secrete Aβ-Immunoreactive Peptides That Lack a Free Asp1
N-Terminus
The above purification and mass spectrometry indicate
the presence of bona fide Aβ dimers in the 7PA2 medium. However,
the fact that the putative Aβ trimer in the CM does not copurify
with monomer and dimer in our 4-step purification and that only one
dimer band is purified (Figure B and C) whereas
a doublet of putative dimers is apparent in unfractionated 7PA2 CM
(Figure A) suggested that the purified ∼8.5
kDa dimer, and the ∼9.5 and ∼12.5 kDa species have distinct
physical properties. Indeed, this supposition is supported by immunochemical
results using 3D6, a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes
the free Asp1 N-terminal residue of Aβ generated by β-secretase., Although 3D6 detects Aβ monomers in SEC fractions 10–11
off of our Superdex 75 column (which correspond to a MW of ∼4–5
kDa) and also faintly detects much larger Aβ-immunoreactive
species (&gt;70 kDa) running natively in the void volume (fractions
5–6), the intermediate soluble species that migrate higher
than ∼4.5 kDa on SDS–PAGE and occur in SEC fractions
7–9 as detected by 6E10 (Figure A, left panel and Figure S2, ) are not detectable by 3D6 (Figure A, right panels and Figure S2, ). The cause of the apparent conflict
between the mass spectrometry data on the fully purified ∼8
kDa species, which confirm the presence of a dimer beginning at Asp1,
and the inability to detect this ∼8 kDa band with 3D6 on IP/WBs
of the total CM is not yet clear. It is possible that the purification
procedure facilitated the enrichment of a low-abundance Asp1 dimer
that otherwise is not readily detected. In any event, our immunochemical
results indicate the presence in CM of low MW Aβ-immunoreactive
APP fragments that do not have an exposed (free) Asp1 N-terminus required
for the binding of 3D6.

The majority of the ∼8.5/9 kDa and ∼12.5
kDa Aβ-immunoreactive species in 7PA2 CM contain residues N-terminal
of Asp1 of Aβ. (A) One milliliter of 10-fold concentrated 7PA2
CM was injected onto a Superdex 75 column and 1 mL fractions collected
(#3–13), lyophilized, and equal volumes Western blotted with
6E10 (left panel) or 3D6 (right panel). M, D, and T denote the position
where the putative Aβ monomer, dimer, and trimer species migrate,
and the migration of PAGE MW standards (kDa) are indicated on the
left. Elution of Blue dextran (void) and linear dextran SEC standards
of 9.9 and 4.4 kDa are indicated by vertical arrows. (B) 7PA2 CM (2
mL) was first IP’d with the antibody indicated above the lanes
labeled 1, and the resultant supernatant was then IP’d with
R1282 (lane 2). The polyclonal antibody pre-β, which recognizes
APP sequences between residues 577–596 lying N-terminal of
Aβ Asp1, precipitated large amounts of 6E10-immunoreactive species
and effectively depleted CM of the ∼8.5/9 kDa and ∼12.5
kDa species otherwise precipitated by R1282. In contrast, the Asp1-specific
antibody, 3D6, precipitated only an ∼4.5 kDa Aβ monomer
leaving most of the putative dimers and trimers to be precipitated
by R1282.

To further examine this possibility,
we conducted a series of sequential IP experiments using antibodies
raised to various human APP sequences within and flanking the Aβ
region. Following each such IP, we then performed a second IP on the
residual supernatant using the pan anti-Aβ antiserum, R1282,
in order to observe any Aβ-reactive species not brought down
by the first IP. All of these samples were Western blotted in parallel
with 6E10, an antibody directed to Aβ residues 6–10. Antibodies 4G8 (midregion) and 2G3 (Aβ40) plus 21F12 (Aβ42) were able to IP both
the Aβ monomer and the higher MW bands detectable by 6E10 (Figure B). As expected, an antibody raised to the cytoplasmic
tail of APP (C8) did not IP any species detectable by 6E10 (Figure B). However, pre-β, an antiserum raised to
a synthetic peptide of the 20 residues immediately N-terminal to the
β-secretase cleavage site (residues 577–596 based on
APP695 numbering; −1 to −20 relative to Asp1
of Aβ),, recognized several peptides larger
than ∼4.5 kDa that appeared to comigrate in part with proteins
IP’d by R1282; the pre-β antibody did not detect the
monomer (Figure B). This unexpected finding
suggests that certain species &gt;4.5 kDa recognized by 6E10 are extended
N-terminal to the Asp1 of Aβ, consistent with their lack of
reactivity with 3D6 (Figure A and Figure S3, ), which requires a free
Asp1 for recognition., Importantly, antibodies with
similar specificities to 3D6 and pre-β (Table ) produced highly comparable results. That is, 82E1 (which
is specific for Asp1 of Aβ) precipitated only the monomer, and
1G6 (which recognizes an APP sequence ∼20 residues N-terminal
of Asp1) precipitated peptides between ∼8 and 14 kDa but not
the monomer (Figure S3, ).

Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage
Analysis Indicate That the Majority of the Aβ-Immunoreactive
∼8.5/9 kDa and ∼12.5 kDa Species in 7PA2 CM Have Extended
N-Termini
Because our original radiosequencing of the 7PA2
Aβ oligomers had shown that both the monomer and the putative
dimer and trimer bands cut out of one-dimensional gels contained Aβ
sequences beginning at Asp1, and because
the current mass spectrometry of the purified ∼8 kDa dimer
band also indicated an Asp1 start site (Figure ), we used orthogonal biochemical methods to determine whether 7PA2
cells actually secrete a mixture of Aβ-containing species, some
that begin at Asp1 and some with N-termini extending “to the
left” of Asp1. First, we preformed two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
(2DGE) employing isoelectric focusing over a pH range capable of resolving
authentic Asp1-initiated Aβ species from N-terminally extended
(NTE) Aβ species. To produce a peptide preparation that could
be readily solubilized for isoelectric focusing, 7PA2 CM was concentrated,
depleted of APPs using DEAE sepharose, and then chromatographed on
a Superdex 75 column eluted in a volatile buffer. Fractions 8, 9,
and 10 were pooled and then lyophilized to a give a preparation rich
in Aβ-immunoreactive species of masses between ∼14 and
∼4 kDa. This material was then subjected to 2DGE, i.e., isoelectric
focusing in the horizontal dimension and denaturing PAGE in the vertical
dimension. Once separated in this way, the proteins were transferred
onto nitrocellulose, and Aβ-immunoreactive bands were visualized
using 6E10. Unexpectedly, only one 6E10-positive spot had an isoelectric
point (pI) of ∼5.5 close to that expected for Aβ beginning
at Asp1, and this migrated in the lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS)–PAGE
dimension at a molecular weight consistent with that of the Aβ
monomer (Figure A). All of the 6E10-positive
bands that migrated on LDS–PAGE with predicted masses ≥6
kDa have pIs less than or equal to 5. Since Aβ peptides beginning
at Asp1 and extending to Lys28 and beyond have predicted pIs of ∼5.3,
and noncovalent oligomers of Aβ1–40 monomers should have
the same pI as the monomer, the lack of species larger than the monomer
at ∼pH 5.3 on our 2D gels indicated that true oligomers are
not detected by this method. The fact that the ∼8–9
kDa and 12–14 kDa species have pIs ≤5.0 is consistent
with these species having NTEs predicted to be ≥34 residues
long (ExPASy Proteomics server).

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and
cyanogen bromide cleavage analysis indicate that the majority of the
Aβ-immunoreactive ∼8.5/9 kDa and ∼12.5 kDa species
in 7PA2 CM have N-termini that extend beyond Asp1. (A) One milliliter
of 10-fold concentrated 7PA2 CM was used for SEC, and fractions rich
in Aβ-immunoreactive species of masses between ∼14 and
∼4 kDa (see Figure B) were pooled and
used for 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis with immobilized pH 4–7
gradient strips and 4–12% bis-tris gels. 6E10 was used for
Western blotting. MW markers were loaded in the well next to the strip,
and their migration is indicated on the left; the pH gradient is shown
on the bottom. The ∼4.5 kDa species migrated with the anticipated
pI of Aβ (i.e., ∼5.5), whereas the ∼8.5/9 kDa
and ∼12.5 kDa species had lower pI’s not compatible
with oligomers of Aβ. (B) Ten-fold concentrated 7PA2 CM was
fractionated using a Superdex 75 SEC column as described above. Fractions
8–9 were pooled, lyophilized, and designated as the putative
oligomer (Oligo) fraction. Monomer-containing fraction 10 (Mono) was
lyophilized in a separate tube. The Oligo and Mono samples were incubated
overnight in 70% formic acid ± 0.1 M cyanogen bromide (CNBr).
Thereafter, samples were electrophoresed on a 12% bis-tris gel and
Western blotted. For these experiments, we used a sequential immunoblotting
approach: first using pre-β (1st panel) and 2G3/21F12 (4th panel),
and then reprobing the pre-β blot with 6E10 (3rd panel) and
the 2G3/21F12 blot with 3D6 (2nd panel). CNBr treatment (+) causes
a slight down-shift in the migration of the monomer detected by 3D6
and 6E10 and a loss of 2G3/21F12 reactivity, results consistent with
cleavage of the monomer after Met35. CNBr treatment of the Oligo fraction
(+) leads to the appearance of an ∼4 kDa band recognized by
3D6, thus demonstrating that the Oligo fraction contains N-terminally
extended Aβ species.

To complement this 2DGE approach, we used cleavage with cyanogen
bromide (CNBr) as another means to discriminate between NTE-Aβ
and canonical Asp1-starting Aβ species. CNBr cleaves polypeptides
on the C-terminal side of methionines. Aβ contains a single
Met at position 35, and in the 100 APP residues N-terminal to the
Aβ region, there are only 3 Met residues. Fortuitously, one
of these is immediately N-terminal of Asp1, and therefore, CNBr cleavage
of NTE-Aβ species should liberate Aβ sequences beginning
at Asp1. For these experiments, we fractionated 7PA2 CM using SEC
and studied the effects of CNBr on the ∼4.5 kDa monomer fraction
(Frac. 10) vs the ∼8–12.5 kDa species (a pool of Frac.
8 and 9) (fraction numbering is as in Figures B and A). Consistent with our prior results
(Figure ), the SEC-isolated monomer (“Mono
−” in Figure B) migrates on
SDS–PAGE as a single band at ∼4.5 kDa before CNBr cleavage
and is recognized by 3D6 (indicating its free Asp1 N-terminus), 6E10,
and a combination of 2G3 + 21F12 (indicating its free C-termini) but
is not recognized by pre-β. Incubation of this material with
CNBr (“Mono +” lane in Figure B) results in loss of reactivity with 2G3/21F12 and a slightly faster
migration of the band detected by 3D6 and 6E10 (Figure B). This result is entirely consistent with an Aβ species
beginning at Asp1 and extending C-terminal to at least Val40 that
loses its C-terminal (2G3/21F12) immunoreactivity after the cleavage
by CNBr at Met35 of Aβ. In contrast, the same experiments on
the ∼8–12.5 kDa species indicated that these species
are N-terminally extended beyond Asp1. For example, SEC fractions
8 and 9 contain little 3D6-reactive species before CNBr (“Oligo
−” in Figure B), but after CNBr
(“Oligo +”) treatment, a new and prominent 3D6-immunoreactive
∼4 kDa band has been generated. Similarly, CNBr treatment markedly
alters the species detectable by 6E10, i.e., it drastically reduced
the amount of ∼6–18 kDa species and produced a new ∼4
kDa band. These CNBr cleavage experiments, together with our 2DGE
(Figure A) and immunoprofiling (Figure B), clearly demonstrate that the majority of ∼8.5–12.5
kDa Aβ-immunoreactive species in the 7PA2 CM are NTE-Aβ
species and not oligomers of Aβ monomers beginning at Asp1.

β-Secretase Inhibition Increases the Levels of N-Terminally
Extended Aβ-Containing Peptides in the 7PA2 CM
To examine
the nature of the proteolytic processing of APP that could generate
NTE-Aβ species, 7PA2 cells were conditioned in the presence
of β- or γ-secretase inhibitors. In cells treated with
DAPT (a well-characterized γ-secretase inhibitor,) all of the bands in the lower gel region normally detected by 6E10,
including the Aβ monomer, were decreased or not present in the
CM, confirming that all of these Aβ-containing species are dependent
on γ-secretase processing, as expected (Figure A). Compound IV, a β-secretase inhibitor, decreased the generation of the ∼4.5
kDa Aβ monomer, as expected, but significantly increased the
levels of the 6E10 (Figure A) and pre-β
(Figure B) reactive species (migrating from
∼5 to ∼15 kDa), when compared to vehicle-treated (DMSO)
cells. Importantly, a similar increase was evident when other potent
BACE-specific inhibitors such as Compound III (Figure S4, ),
Dr9, or Merck compound 3 (not shown) were used. These inhibitor effects are consistent
with other recent studies on 7PA2 CM and
demonstrate that some 6E10-positive species migrating above the monomer
are generated by alternative proteolytic processing of APP that increases
when β-secretase-mediated production of the monomer is pharmacologically
inhibited.

β-Secretase is not necessary for the generation of certain
higher MW Aβ-immunoreactive species. (A and B) Duplicate dishes
of 7PA2 cells were conditioned for ∼15 h in the presence or
absence of the γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT (10 μM); DMSO
vehicle; or the β-secretase inhibitor, compound IV (3 μM).
CHO- is the CM of parental CHO cells not expressing human APP. CM
was collected from cells and used for IP with (A) AW8 and (B) pre-β,
and both Western blotted with 6E10. DAPT treatment of 7PA2 cells blocks
the secretion of most species detectable by both R1282 IP and pre-β
IP. Aβ monomer is significantly reduced in the presence of compound
IV (C–IV), but 6E10 immunoreactive species migrating between
∼5–16 kDa are increased in quantity. Importantly, certain
species IP’d by pre-β are still produced in the presence
of DAPT, suggesting that these are not products of γ-secretase
activity. (C) Introducing the “Swedish” APP missense
mutations (K595N and M596L) increases Aβ monomer levels but
decreases levels of the ∼5–12.5 kDa 6E10-reactive species
relative to CHO cells expressing wtAPP. Conversely, an M596V mutation,
which reduces β-secretase cleavage, decreases Aβ monomers
and increases the higher MW species. M, D, and T denote the position
where putative Aβ monomer, dimer, and trimer species would migrate,
and the migration of MW standards (in kDa) are indicated on the left.

To examine further the apparent
lack of involvement of β-secretase in generating certain 6E10-reactive
APP fragments migrating above the ∼4.5 kDa monomer, we stably
transfected parental CHO cells with APP constructs bearing single
amino acid substitutions within the β-secretase cleavage region.
The Flp-In transfection system was used to ensure equal expression
of each APP construct. Lys595Asn and Met596Leu missense mutations
in APP occur together in a Swedish kindred with early onset AD, and this mutant precursor undergoes enhanced
cleavage by β-secretase to generate more Aβ monomers than
wild type (wt) APP does.− Consistent
with the above BACE inhibitor findings, these Swedish mutations preserve
Aβ monomer generation but decrease the amounts of 6E10-reactive
species &gt;4.5 kDa (Figure C). Conversely,
expression of an artificial Met596Val mutation that we previously
found to sharply decrease β-secretase cleavage of APP lowers the production of the Aβ monomer,
as expected, but substantially increases the generation of larger
Aβ-immunoreactive species (Figure C).
These reciprocal findings, coupled with the BACE inhibitor results
(Figure A and B), indicate that the majority
of the Aβ-immunoreactive species detected by 6E10 above ∼4.5
kDa do not arise from β-secretase processing, explaining their
lack of reactivity with 3D6 (Asp1-specific).

The findings with
the two β-secretase inhibitors used in Figure  and Figure S4 () were confirmed by a pre-β IP of the CM from similarly treated
7PA2 cells: BACE inhibition increased the secretion of species precipitable
by pre-β, whereas DAPT decreased most of these species (Figure B). Of note, certain species IP’d by pre-β
that migrate between ∼8 and 14 kDa and are detected by 6E10
are not altered by γ-secretase inhibition, suggesting that a
portion of the bands detected by pre-β represent a separate
class of APP fragments generated by non-γ-secretase events.
Overall, our findings suggest the existence in this cell line of APP
cleavage event(s) occurring N-terminal to the canonical β-secretase
site, followed by γ-secretase cleavage to generate a C-terminus.

Secreted NTE-Aβ Species Inhibit Hippocampal LTP
In
view of our observation that soluble NTE-Aβ species constitute
the majority of Aβ-immunoreactive species larger than the Aβ
monomer in the 7PA2 CM, we asked whether the NTE-Aβ species
were also capable of impairing synaptic plasticity. To this end, we
performed immunodepletions of either the Aβ oligomers or the
NTE-Aβ species from 7PA2 CM, in order to selectively remove
Aβ species having either a free Asp1 N-terminus or the N-terminal
extensions, respectively. Because the abundant amount of APPsα
present in 7PA2 CM could compete with the ability of certain antisera
to fully immunodeplete the Aβ-NTE species, 7PA2 CM was first
incubated with DE23 anion-exchange cellulose to bind and remove the
highly charged APPs while leaving the various 4–17 kDa Aβ-immunoreactive
products in solution. This APP preclearing step generated CM that
could then be quantitatively immunodepleted of the NTE species with
the pre-β antiserum. C8, an antiserum directed to the APP C-terminus,
served as a negative control since it did not immunodeplete any of
the Aβ-containing species found in 7PA2 CM (Figure B).

Incubation of 7PA2 CM with PAS and PAG
beads in the absence of antibody does not alter the detection of the
Aβ-immunoreactive species IP’d by 1282 (not shown), and
consistent with previous observations,, this negative-control
“bead-treated” CM still significantly reduced LTP in
adult mouse hippocampus (116.9 ± 3.5% at 60 min, n = 10 slices) compared to that by ACSF supplemented with bead-treated
DMEM alone (142.5 ± 3.4%, n = 11 slices; p &lt; 0.01) (Figure A). Also in
accord with our prior work, 7PA2 CM immunodepleted with R1282 no longer
impaired LTP (132.4 ± 3.5%, n = 11; p &lt; 0.01) compared to that with CM treated with beads
alone or immunodepleted with antiserum C8 (117.4 ± 2.8%, n = 8) (Figure B,D). Two rounds
of immunodepletion of 7PA2 CM with R1282 essentially removed all Aβ
peptide containing species between ∼4 and 17 kDa (Figure D). Immunodepletion of the CM with 3D6 did not significantly
rescue LTP (122.4 ± 3.8%, n = 10 p &gt; 0.05 for 3D6 compared to beads alone), whereas immunodepletion
with pre-β did (141.4 ± 3.2%, n = 9; p &lt; 0.01 compared to beads alone) (Figure C,D). The latter result indicates that the N-terminally extended
APP fragments containing the intact Aβ region can impair hippocampal
synaptic plasticity, independent of any effects of Aβ oligomers
in the CM.

N-Terminally extended Aβ-containing species in 7PA2 CM inhibit
hippocampal LTP. (A) Adult mouse hippocampus slices were exposed to
plain DMEM (black) or 7PA2 CM that had been mock-immunodepeleted with
antibody-free beads (gray). (B) Immunodepletion with R1282 (blue)
significantly decreases the impairment of LTP by 7PA2 CM, whereas
immunodepletion with C8 (red) has no effect. The shaded gray horizontal
bar represents the mean ±2 SEM of the traces with 7PA2 CM mock-treated
with beads shown in A. (C) Immunodepletion of NTE species with pre-β
(blue) prevents the 7PA2 CM-mediated LTP impairment, but selective
removal of only Aβ species starting with a free Asp1 (by antibody
3D6; red) does not significantly decrease the LTP impairment. (D)

supernatants used in B and C that were subsequently IP’d with
R1282.

Discussion
Cultured
cells that express mutant human APP and secrete Aβ peptides
into their medium have been used to advantage in numerous studies
investigating the biological effects of Aβ. 7PA2 cells provided
the first example of a cell line that secreted Aβ-immunoreactive
species with biological activity., These species
migrated on one-dimensional SDS–PAGE gels with molecular weights
expected for dimers and trimers were not precipitable with antibodies
to flanking APP sequences and showed radiosequencing patterns consistent
with Aβ species beginning at Asp1. However, the precise chemical identity of the Aβ-immunoreactive
species secreted by these cells has not been established heretofore.
Consequently, we sought to purify 7PA2-derived ∼8.5–12.5
kDa Aβ-immunoreactive species to homogeneity (as judged by silver
staining), so as to determine their primary sequence (by mass spectrometry)
and synaptotoxic potential (by LTP assays).

Using a combination
of anion-exchange, immuno-affinity, ligand-affinity, and size-exclusion
chromatographies, we successfully purified the ∼4.5 and ∼8
kDa Aβ species and definitively identified them as monomer and
noncovalent dimer, respectively, of Aβ1–40. Thereafter,
we demonstrated that the purified Aβ dimer from 7PA2 CM, free
of other proteins, was sufficient to inhibit LTP in live wt rats.
Why the ∼12.5 and 9 kDa 6E10-reactive species were not recovered
in the purification procedure used to isolate monomer and dimer is
unclear. Nonetheless, the preferential loss of these species during
purification suggests that they have different physical properties
than the monomer and ∼8 kDa dimer. Indeed, in preliminary ion-exchange
and reverse-phase experiments (not shown), the ∼12.5 and 9
kDa species eluted in a fashion that indicated that they are more
negatively charged than monomer and dimer and could therefore
have distinct primary sequences.

In parallel with our dimer
purification efforts, we applied to the 7PA2 CM for the first time
an antibody (3D6) uniquely specific for Asp1 of Aβ., We observed APP fragments that could be precipitated by pan anti-Aβ
antisera (R1282; AW8) and blotted by anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies
that are not Asp1 specific (e.g., 6E10; 4G8) but that could not be
detected using 3D6. This unexpected finding led to the experiments
herein that demonstrated that NTE-Aβ species are major contributors
to the plasticity-disrupting activity of 7PA2 CM. Specifically, certain
∼8–12.5 kDa Aβ-immunoreactive species are recognized
by antibodies (pre-β and 1G6) directed to a 20-residue region
just N-terminal to the β-secretase cleavage site, and these
species migrate on 2D-gels with sizes and pIs consistent with Aβ
species with N-terminal extensions &gt;34 residues. Furthermore, treatment
of these species with CNBr leads to liberation of the Aβ monomer
beginning at Asp1. Most importantly, we present compelling evidence
that 7PA2-derived NTE-Aβ fragments impair hippocampal LTP at
subnanomolar concentrations and that this synaptotoxic activity is
specifically removed by selectively immunodepleting them with the
pre-β antiserum.

In view of these new findings, we re-examined
our original autoradiograms of IPs that had used pre-β vs anti-Aβ
antibodies and confirmed that aliquots
of CM of the 7PA2 cell line used at that time (but no longer available)
had distinct Aβ-reactive species and pre-β-reactive species
whose electrophoretic migration did not overlap on gels or by sequential
IPs with the respective antibodies. The most parsimonious explanation
for the heterogeneity of Aβ-containing APP fragments that we
observe in the present study vs that in 1995 is that the level of
β-secretase activity in these non-neural cells changed with
cell passage over time. We hypothesize that more recent aliquots of
passaged 7PA2 cells have decreased β-secretase levels and/or
activity, allowing more APP holoproteins to be processed by alternative
proteases which are not inhibited by β-secretase inhibitors
and which cleave N-terminal to that Met-Asp site.

Taken together,
our previous analyses and those in the
current study indicate that 7PA2 cells generate significant amounts
of Aβ monomers and NTE-Aβ species (which are also monomeric)
as well as small amounts of noncovalent Aβ1–40 dimers.
In addition, we also found trace amounts high molecular weight aggregates
composed of monomer that eluted in the void volume of a Superdex 75
column. Future studies will be required to determine the relative
synaptic potency of the dimers vs the NTE-Aβ’s in the
7PA2 CM, but our experiments herein testing the activity of 7PA2 CM
immunodepleted with different antibodies indicate that NTE-Aβ’s
are the primary plasticity-disrupting activity in the current 7PA2
line. Moreover, we present clear pharmacological evidence that the
inhibition of BACE leads to an increase in NTE-Aβ’s.
These findings are consistent with prior studies that tested BACE
inhibitors on 7PA2 cells and indicate
that at least in CHO cells, APP can be cleaved at sites N-terminal
to Asp1 of the Aβ domain by one or more proteases, the action
of which are in competition with BACE. Although these alternate species
are monomeric APP fragments, they apparently contain a conformation
of the Aβ region that confers synaptotoxic effects, as measured
by LTP (Figure ). Comparative studies using
soluble Aβ oligomers isolated from the human (AD) cortex or
pure, synthetic Aβ show that the electrophysiological effects
of these NTE-Aβ monomers are indistinguishable from those of
the 7PA2 CM,, and all 3 sources can also induce
AD-type τ hyperphosphorylation and neuritic dystrophy in cultured
primary rodent neurons.

We conclude
that the heterogeneity of bioactive Aβ-containing species secreted
by the 7PA2 cell line makes them a useful source of synaptotoxic Aβ-positive
APP fragments, including Aβ dimers, but suggests that any functional
effects should be compared to those elicited by human brain-derived
or synthetic Aβ dimers. Indeed, given that our previous efforts
did not identify Aβ oligomers or NTE-Aβ’s in the
CM of human neuroblastoma cell lines or primary cortical neurons, it is seems likely that under normal circumstances,
neurons do not secrete significant amounts of Aβ oligomers or
NTE-Aβ. Nevertheless, there is evidence of alternate NTE-like
Aβ-immunoreactive species in human CSF. Consequently, it will be important in future studies to probe other
cell culture systems and brain tissues for such NTE-Aβ species,
especially to learn whether (as observed here) β-secretase inhibition
leads to a rise in the levels of synaptic plasticity-disrupting NTE-Aβ’s.
The latter phenomenon, if confirmed to occur in vivo, would have important
implications for the chronic inhibition of BACE1 in humans.
