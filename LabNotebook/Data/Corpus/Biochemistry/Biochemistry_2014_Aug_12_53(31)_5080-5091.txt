The P450s
make up a ubiquitous
superfamily of mixed-function oxygenases that catalyze a variety of
chemical reactions and play vital roles in important biological processes.− One of the most highly conserved residues of the P450s is the phenylalanine
in the heme binding motif (FXXGXR/HXCXG), located on the proximal
side of the heme where its redox partners bind., The
phenylalanine is in van der Waals (vdw) contact with the heme and
the axial Cys436 thiolate. As a result, it is strategically positioned
to influence P450 activity by modulating the electron donating ability
of the thiolate. While the properties of most of the corresponding
phenylalanine to histidine mutants of class I and II P450s indicate
a key role for the phenylalanine in the regulation of catalytic activity,
there are intriguing exceptions (CYP121 and P450cin).,− In some class III P450s that are isomerases rather than monooxygenases,
the phenylalanine is replaced with a tryptophan.− Nitric oxide
reductase, a class IV enzyme, retains the phenylalanine. These observations raise the question of the
function of the conserved phenylalanine and the molecular and atomic
level mechanism by which residues in the heme binding motif exert
their delicately balanced effects in a particular P450. A related consideration is if phenylalanine
is not important for activity and thermodynamic properties, then what
other residues control these parameters?

In an effort to gain
insight into the structural basis and regulation
of catalysis in microsomal P450s in particular and P450s in general,
Phe429 in CYP2B4 has been mutated to histidine and the mutant protein
has been characterized.− One of the key experimental and theoretical findings
was that a unique H-bond between the histidine and the axial cysteine,
which alters electron density on the axial thiolate, adversely affects
enzymatic activity. This suggests that Phe429, by virtue of its steric
bulk and relative chemical inertness, not only protects the protein
from deleterious interactions but also may be modified to generate
desirable enzymatic activities. Our findings and comparison to other
heme proteins reveal that P450s employ a variety of residues on both
the proximal and distal surfaces to regulate the versatility of the
catalytic repertoire and mechanisms of P450s.

Experimental
Procedures
Overview of the Purification of Truncated F429H
Truncated
CYP2B4 F429H refers to a CYP2B4 in which residues 3–21 were
deleted and the following mutations were introduced: G22K, H23K, P24T,
K25S, A26S, H27K, and R29K. An H226Y mutation was made and a four-histidine
tag added at the carboxyl terminus as described previously. The cell pellet was prepared by sonication,
solubilization, and ultracentrifugation before being loaded on a series
of chromatography columns, including DE52, Reactive Red, Octyl Sepharose,
and hydroxyapatite columns, as previously described. Because the F429H mutant protein is more susceptible to
inactivation to cyt P420, butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) was added
to all buffers (to scavenge free radicals formed by the ether-containing
detergent). The pure protein was concentrated to ∼1 mM using
a 50000 molecular weight cutoff VivaSpin 20 and immediately used for
crystallization experiments. The details of the purification are provided
in the .

Crystallization,
Data Collection, Structure Determination, and
Refinement
Crystals of truncated CYP2B4 F429H were obtained
using the hanging or sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing
2 μL of the previously described protein solution, 2 μL
of the reservoir solution, and 0.4 μL [10% (w/v)] of Anapoe
X-114 to facilitate crystallization. The crystallization trays were
both set up and incubated at 4 °C. The crystals were transferred
to a cryoprotectant, flash-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen prior
to data collection.

The data set was processed using HKL2000
0.98.703g. The structure was determined
using the molecular replacement program Phaser 2.1.4 in the CCP4 6.1.13 suite. The
model was refined using AutoBuster and
manually rebuilt in COOT 0.6.2 and O
10.0.3. The ligand CIF files for heme
and 4-CPI were generated using GRADE 1.1.1. Structure validations were conducted in MolProbity 3.17. The structure scored at the 100% percentile
for quality among structures of similar resolution, based on Ramachandran,
rotamer, Cβ deviation, bond length, or angle analysis.
Details of the crystallization procedure are provided in the .

Activity of F429H CYP2B4
The activity of mutant full
length CYP2B4 was determined in a purified reconstituted system by
measuring the amount of formaldehyde formed by N-demethylation of
benzphetamine (BP) using Nash’s reagent as previously described. Wild type P450 and P450 reductase were purified
as described previously.,

Determination of the Affinity
(Ks) of CYP2B4 for Substrates in the Presence
of P450 Reductase and
Cyt b5 and the Apparent Km between the P450 and P450 Reductase
The following
biochemical experiments were performed with the full length wild type
(WT) and the CYP2B4 F429H as previously described and with full length reductase and cyt b5 purified as previously described., The dissociation constant Ks between
the substrate benzphetamine and the P450s was determined by measuring
the type I spectral change that occurs when benzphetamine binds to
P450. In a typical experiment, P450 [5–10
μM in 15% glycerol in 50 mM KPO4 buffer (pH 7.4)]
was placed in the temperature-controlled sample and the reference
cuvettes, maintained at either 15 or 30 °C. After 10 min, a stable
baseline was recorded. An aliquot of a benzphetamine-containing stock
solution was then added to the sample cuvette, and an equal volume
of buffer A [0.1 M KPO4 buffer (pH 7.4) and 15% glycerol]
was added to the reference cuvette. The difference spectrum was recorded
5 min after the addition of benzphetamine. The concentration of benzphetamine
varied from 0.04 to 1 mM. The absolute absorbance change from 382
to 420 nm (ΔA382–420) was
plotted versus the concentration of benzphetamine. The absorbance
changes were corrected for dilution. An isosbestic point was observed
at 405 nm in the absolute spectra upon conversion from low to high
spin.

The apparent Km of the CYP2B4–P450
reductase complex was determined by measuring the rate of N-demethylation
of benzphetamine at various reductase concentrations as previously
described. WT CYP2B4 (0.16 nmol) or 0.4
nmol of mutant CYP2B4 F429H was mixed with a 0.25–5-fold molar
excess of P450 reductase and a 200-fold molar excess of DLPC in 50
mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The solution was then diluted to 0.8 mL with 50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM benzphetamine (final concentration
of 0.2 μM for WT 2B4 and 0.5 μM for mutant F429H). The
reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH (final concentration
of 300 μM). Vmax and Km were determined by fitting the rate of formaldehyde
formation at each reductase concentration as described previously.

Determination of the Midpoint Redox Potential
(Em) of CYP2B4 F429H by the Dye Equilibrium
Method
The midpoint redox potentials, Em, of
the full length WT and CYP2B4 F429H were determined at 20 °C
in buffer A [0.1 M potassium phosphate and 15% glycerol (pH 7.4)]
as described previously. Benzyl viologen
(Em = −341 mV) and phenosafranin
(Em = −244 mV) were used as the
redox dyes because the Em values of these
two dyes are similar to those of the wild type and P450 F429H. We
note that the absolute values of the Em of benzyl viologen and phenosafranin vary in the literature with
a range of values from −0.31 to 0.35 V for benzyl viologen
and from −0.244 to 0.252 V for phenosafranin at pH 7 and 20
°C., This variation will dictate the absolute Em value of P450s determined in this work.

The experiments were performed in an anaerobic tonometer. All glassware
and solutions were deoxygenated overnight in an anaerobic glovebox
(Belle Technology) with an oxygen content of ∼1 ppm. In a typical
experiment, 1 mL of an 8 μM solution of CYP2B4 was incubated
overnight in buffer A at 4 °C in the presence of 0.38 mM dilauroyl-l-3-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) to remove oxygen and prevent
aggregation in the subsequent titration with sodium dithionite. Prior
to the titration with dithionite, the dye was added to the P450 sample
at a final concentration of 16 μM. In the case of studying the
effect of substrate on Em, benzphetamine
was included in the P450 samples at a final concentration of 1 mM.
A standardized solution of sodium dithionite (∼80 μM)
was added in 2 μL increments to the mixture of P450 and the
mediator. The spectra were recorded on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer,
prior to the addition of dithionite and following each addition of
each aliquot of dithionite once the spectral changes had stabilized.
The spectra recorded at the start and end of the titration represent
fully oxidized and fully reduced P450, respectively. The ratio of
the oxidized P450 versus the reduced P450 (P450Ox/P450Re) was calculated from the absorbance at 450 nm in the presence
of benzyl viologen and at 405 nm in the presence of phenosafranin.
Benzyl viologen shows minimal absorbance changes at 450 nm when it
is reduced, while phenosafranin has an isosbestic point at 405 nm.
The ratio of the oxidized to the reduced dye (dyeOx/dyeRe) was calculated from the absorbance at 730 nm for benzyl
viologen and 520 nm for phenosafranin. The Em of P450 was calculated according to the Nerst equation: E = Em + RT/F ln(P450Ox/P450Re), where F, R, and T are the Faraday
constant (9.65 × 104 C mol–1), gas
constant (8.31 J K–1 mol–1), and
temperature (kelvin), respectively.

Determination of the Rate
Constant for the Transfer of an Electron
from P450 Reductase to Ferric CYP2B4
The rate of transfer
of an electron from full length P450 reductase to ferric P450 was
determined as previously described. A
solution containing ∼5 μM P450 and ∼5 μM
P450 reductase was incubated in an anaerobic glovebox (Belle Technology)
at 4 °C overnight in buffer A containing 0.3 mM dilauroyl-l-3-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and 1 mM benzphetamine to preform
a P450–P450 reductase complex in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer
(model SF-61 DX2, Hi-Tech), housed in a glovebox. The second syringe
was loaded with CO-saturated buffer A that contained 0.3 mM NADPH
and 1 mM benzphetamine. The rate of reduction of P450 by P450 reductase
was monitored at 450 nm. The rate of
the first electron transfer was determined by fitting the absorbance
traces at 450 nm with multiple exponentials using KinetAsyst software
(Hi-Tech).

Determination of the Kinetics of the Autoxidation
of Oxyferrous
CYP2B4 F429H
The kinetics of the autoxidation of full length
P450s were determined as previously described. Briefly, the P450 in 15% glycerol and 0.1 M potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) was reduced with a standardized solution of sodium
dithionite in an anaerobic tonometer. The reduced protein was introduced
into one syringe of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Hi-Tech SF61DX2
in a glovebox) and rapidly mixed with an air-saturated solution ([O2] ≅ 0.32 mM at 15 °C) of buffer. The experiments
were performed at 15 °C in the presence of 5–10 μM
P450 in buffer A and 1 mM benzphetamine with a Hi-Tech stopped-flow
61 DX2 spectrophotometer housed in a glovebox. The kinetics of autoxidation
were monitored at 438 nm after the sample had been rapidly mixed with
an air-saturated buffer solution ([O2] ≅ 0.32 mM).
Rate constants and amplitudes were obtained by fitting the kinetic
traces at 438 nm with multiple exponentials using KinetAsyst software
(Hi-Tech).

Results
Steady-State
Activity of CYP2B4 F429H
The F429H mutant
exhibits a significant decrease in activity (N-demethylation of BP),
retaining only 3.6% [Vmax = 1.60 ±
0.05 nmol of product min–1 (nmol of 450)−1] of the wild type activity [Vmax = 49
± 5 nmol of product min–1 (nmol of 450)−1]. The apparent Km (0.067
± 0.004 μM) of P450 reductase for the WT and F429H mutant
is similar, indicating that the low activity of the mutant is not
caused by a decreased affinity for the reductase. The activity of
both proteins is coupled to the same extent, ∼50% (50% of NADPH
utilized for product formation). Mutation of the homologous phenylalanine
to histidine in P450cam and BM3 resulted in an ∼85%
loss of activity., The significant loss of activity
in three different model P450s (including class I and class II proteins
with ferredoxin and flavin redox partners, respectively) in which
the highly conserved phenylalanine at the beginning of the β-bulge
has been mutated to histidine attests to the key role this residue
plays in P450 catalysis.

UV–Visible Spectra of CYP2B4 F429H
In the absence
of substrate, both the wild type and F429H mutant have a spectrum
of a low-spin ferric heme with a Soret peak at 416 and broad α
and β bands at 571 and 534 ± 3 nm, respectively. The absorption
maximum of the F429H ferrous–CO complex is blue-shifted from
450 nm in the wild type to 446 nm in the mutant. These changes in
the UV–visible spectrum of the mutant are consistent with the
changes in axial ligand bonding that alter the energy levels between
the sulfur π and the porphyrin π* orbitals. In P450s, with the more electron-donating selenocysteine
rather than the sulfur-containing cysteine as an axial ligand, the
maxima of the Fe–CO complex and high-spin ferric protein are
red-shifted compared to those of the wild type proteins.,

Affinity of CYP2B4 F429H for Substrates in the Presence and
Absence of P450 Reductase and Cytochrome b5 (cyt b5)
Addition of benzphetamine
to wild type P450 results in a change in spin state that causes a
type I spectral change (a decrease in absorbance at 416 nm and an
increase at 385 nm and a charge transfer band at 650 nm). This spectral
change is generally considered to reflect the binding of substrate,
and its measurement is known as Ks. However,
because substrates can bind without displacing the heme iron water
ligand, it is actually a surrogate measure of the affinity of substrates
for P450s denoted as Ks. Surprisingly,
at 15 °C, the addition of benzphetamine to F429H caused an only
marginal spectral change (Table ), which illustrates
that the mutant exhibits a Ks of 0.9 ±
0.2 mM while the wild type binds with a Ks of 0.25 ± 0.01 mM. At 30 °C, the binding of benzphetamine
to both WT and F429H is enhanced by a similar amount, as suggested
by the decreased Ks values. Nonetheless,
the mutant continued to show an apparent 5-fold decreased affinity
for benzphetamine. A second substrate, butylated hydroxytoluene, also
caused a change in the spin state of the mutant smaller than that
of the wild type [Ks of 0.31 ± 0.14
μM for WT and Ks of 1.82 ±
0.24 μM for F429H at 25 °C in 100 mM KPi (pH
7.4), 15% glycerol, and 0.3 M NaCl]. The question of whether the stability
of the low-spin form in the presence of the substrate benzphetamine
is a consequence of electronic or structural factors or both remains
unanswered at this time. It is not possible to determine whether (1)
the substrate does not bind or (2) it binds but does not displace
the axial water. A third possibility is that one of the hydroxyl groups
on butylated hydroxytoluene binds to the heme iron and displaces the
axial water. The crystal structure of the F429H mutant protein does
not suggest a structural explanation. An electronic attribution is
also somewhat problematic because P450s with a more electron-donating
selenocysteine rather than the sulfur-containing cysteine as an axial
ligand also stabilize the low-spin ferric form., The Ks for benzphetamine remains virtually
unchanged for both proteins in the presence and absence of P450 reductase.
In contrast, cyt b5 enhances the binding
of benzphetamine to both proteins by ∼5–6-fold, indicating
that the mutant protein is responsive to cyt b5 (Table ).

Midpoint Redox
Potential (Em) of
CYP2B4 F429H
The midpoint redox potentials, Em, were determined in the absence and presence of 1 mM
benzphetamine at 20 °C. To ensure that the redox dyes were not
interfering with measurements of Em, we
investigated the binding of the redox mediator dyes, benzyl viologen
and phenosafranin, to P450 and determined the Em at three different P450/dye molar ratios. The addition of
the redox dyes to P450 did not cause any spectral change, and the Em was independent of the protein/dye ratio (data
not shown). As presented in Table  and Figure , the Em of WT is −332
± 8 mV in the absence of benzphetamine, which is in agreement
with the Em values of −330 to −300
mV published in the literature. In clear
contrast, the Em of F429H is −245
± 6 mV in the absence of benzphetamine, which is an increase
of 87 mV compared to that of the WT. For the WT and F429H P450s examined
in this study, the binding of benzphetamine led to increases in Em of 88 and 15 mV, respectively, indicating
that the binding of benzphetamine to the active site modulates the
redox potential of CYP2B4, presumably by altering the polarity of
the active site.

Reduction of F429H was monitored at 405 nm (○), an isosbestic
point for phenosafranin, whose reduction was followed by 520 nm (●).
The arrows indicate the direction of the absorbance changes during

Rate of Transfer of an Electron from P450 Reductase to Ferric
F429H
To investigate the effect of an 87 mV more positive
redox potential on the reduction of ferric F429H by P450 reductase,
the kinetics of transfer of an electron to the ferric mutant enzyme
were measured in the presence of substrate and CO. The kinetics of
reduction of the ferric WT and F429H mutant proteins are biphasic
(Figure  and Table ). As expected, the high-potential F429H protein is reduced more
rapidly than the wild type.

Stability of Oxyferrous
CYP2B4 F429H
The kinetics of
autoxidation of F429H were monophasic (k = 0.12 ±
0.02 min–1) at 15 °C in the presence of 1 mM
benzphetamine. Oxyferrous F429H is relatively stable with a half-life
of ∼5 min (Figure ). In contrast, wild
type CYP2B4 autoxidized much more rapidly with biphasic rate constants
(amplitudes) of 0.13 ± 0.04 s–1 (40 ±
4%) and 0.048 ± 0.004 s–1 (60 ± 7%), respectively,
and an ∼7.6 s half-life. The enhanced
stability of the distal ligand–heme bond demonstrates the ability
of the residue at the conserved phenylalanine position to regulate
the electronic properties of the heme iron., Less electronegativity on the heme iron results in a tighter heme–trans
ligand interaction. In model porphyrins,
H-bonds to the axial thiolate have also been shown to influence the
reactivity of the heme iron.

Reduction of CYP2B4 F429H/4-(4-Chlorophenyl)
Imidazole (4-CPI)
in the X-ray Beam
Previous experiments have shown that metalloproteins
and heme proteins in particular are frequently reduced by solvated
electrons generated by X-ray photons at cryogenic temperatures of
100 K, the temperature at which crystals are routinely irradiated.− This information prompted us to investigate whether CYP2B4 F429H/4-CPI
was reduced during the course of irradiation of the crystal.

The spectra of crystals of CYP2B4 F429H bound to 4-CPI were recorded
before and after irradiation. Figure A demonstrates
a partial shift in the Soret peak from 415 nm in the oxidized protein
to 450 nm after only a single 1 s exposure to 1.075 Å irradiation.
Using RADDOSE, version 3, it was estimated that 0.17 MGy had been
absorbed by the crystal after 1 s, which is significantly smaller
than the radiation dose limit of 30 MGy. This red shift of the Soret is slightly different from that observed
when the mutant protein is reduced in solution by dithionite. In solution,
the maximal absorbance change is from 422 nm for the ferric protein
to 444 nm for the reduced protein. This minor discrepancy between
the crystal and solution spectra of proteins has been observed in
other heme proteins and has been attributed to the anisotropic properties
of crystals. Reduction was also confirmed
by the emergence of a sharp peak in absorbance at 566 nm (569 nm in
solution) after irradiation of the crystal. The mutant protein continued
to be reduced throughout the irradiation with significant degradation
of the intensity of the reflections.

(A) UV–vis spectra from a single
crystal of F429H/4-CPI
before and following radiation. For comparison, the spectra of oxidized
and reduced F429H/4-CPI in solution are presented. (B) High-frequency
resonance Raman spectra recorded on a single crystal of F429H/4-CPI
before and following exposure to X-rays. The oxidation-state marker
band, ν4, appearing at 1373 cm–1 for ferric F429H/4-CPI species before X-ray exposure was shifted
down by 8 cm–1 to 1365 cm–1 following
irradiation, indicating formation of ferrous F429H/4-CPI.

Resonance
Raman spectra also documented the redox state of the
crystallized protein using the 532 nm laser available at Brookhaven
National Laboratory (Upton, NY). The 532 nm laser excites and is in
resonance primarily with the α and β band transitions
between 530 and 580 nm. Nevertheless, it was possible to excite with
low intensity the “oxidation-state” marker band, ν4, appearing at 1373 cm–1 for the ferric
F429H/4-CPI species (Figure B). Upon exposure to X-rays, this “oxidation-state”
marker band shifted by 8 cm–1 to a lower frequency,
1365 cm–1, indicating the formation of the ferrous
protein. In addition, the intensity of the “spin-state”
marker band, ν10, at 1638 cm–1 decreases
upon irradiation of the crystal, consistent with partial reduction
of the heme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
of the reduction of a single crystal of a ferric microsomal P450 by
both electronic and resonance Raman spectroscopy during the course
of data collection.

The conserved phenylalanine is the first residue
in the conserved
secondary structure known as the β-bulge, whereas the axial
cysteine is the last residue (F429–C436) (Figure ). The rigid β-bulge (1)
enforces close contact between the cysteine and its neighboring residues,
(2) contains two residues, Arg434 and Ser430, that form a salt bridge
and an H-bond with the D and A heme propionates, respectively, and

in the β-bulge preceding and the β-turn following the
axial cysteine are illustrated. The backbone of the conserved residues
is colored green. Note that the amide of Leu437 is pointing away from
the thiolate. Residues Cys436–Glu439 form a typical β-turn
that is characterized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of the
first residue (Cys436) and the amide of the fourth residue (Glu439).
The first residue in such a turn is often a serine, threonine, or
cysteine whose side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the amide of
the third residue in the turn. The hydrogen bond between the thiolate
and amide of Gly438 is colored light green. Side chains of residues
Ser430–Ile435 are not shown for the sake of clarity.

The most notable unique feature
of the structure is the formation
of a hydrogen bond between the δN atom of His429 and the thiolate
of axial cysteine 436 (Figure ). The hydrogen–sulfur
distance was 2.63 Å; the δN–H···S
angle was 145°. The introduced histidine replaces a phenylalanine
whose aromatic ring δH atom with a partial positive charge is
in vdw contact with the thiolate and the heme., The structure and biochemical data are consistent and demonstrate
that the activity of P450s and electron density on the heme iron can
be regulated by the entity interacting with the nonbonded lone electron
pair on the thiolate. The experimental uncertainty of the Fe–S
bond length in the crystal structure would not allow a firm conclusion
with respect to its magnitude. However, it does explain the structural
basis of the observation of a weaker Fe–S bond in the mutant
by resonance Raman spectroscopy.

Two additional differences were noted between the mutant and wild
type. The εN atom of the introduced histidine forms a hydrogen
bond with a water molecule and also the amide side chain of Gln357
(Figure ). The water molecule also hydrogen
bonds to the carbonyl of the Gln357 side chain. For comparison, the
more hydrophobic proximal surface of the corresponding P450 BM3 Phe393His
mutant that lacks a histidine–thiolate bond is shown (Figure ).

Two factors
likely contribute to thiolate H-bond formation in CYP2B4
F429H. The first is the more hydrophilic environment on the proximal
surface of CYP2B4, which is able to stabilize the lone pair of electrons
on the εN atom of histidine by facilitating the formation of
hydrogen bonds to the solvent and the side chain amide of Gln357 (Figure ). If His393 assumes a conformation similar to that
of His429 of CYP2B4, the lone pair of electrons on an εN atom
would encounter a hydrophobic cluster of four leucines that would
discourage the formation of a hydrogen bond with the solvent. Although
the εN atom of His393 is not stabilized by water, the δN
atom of His393 forms a hydrogen bond to water. If H393 were protonated,
the theoretical data in Table  indicate that
it would exert a significant electron withdrawing effect on the axial
thiolate. The second consideration that promotes thiolate−δN
His429 hydrogen bond formation is the more favorable position (closer
and at a more advantageous H-bond angle) of a δN atom than an
εN atom of imidazole with respect to the thiolate.

Nonbonded and
Bonded Interactions of the Cys436 Thiolate
The cysteine thiolate
in P450s possesses an sp3 tetrahedral
hybridization forming two covalent bonds, one with the heme iron and
the other with the β-carbon of cysteine. One pair of the noncovalent
bonded electrons forms an H-bond with the amide of the highly conserved
Gly438 two residues to the carboxyl terminus of the axial thiolate.
(Figures  and  and
Table ). In the wild type, the second nonbonded
lone electron pair of the thiolate does not form a bond but is expected
to occupy a region of high electron density extending toward the hydrogens
on the aromatic ring of Phe429. The distance between the thiolate
and the partially positively charged δH atom on the Phe429 aromatic
ring (3 Å) is consistent with the lack of a formal hydrogen bond., In the mutant, the weak interaction between the second, polarizable,
nonbonded electron pair and the phenylalanine is replaced with a histidine–thiolate
hydrogen bond. Table  compares the tetrahedral
angles observed in the F429H mutant and crystal structures of P450s
and a nitric oxide synthase in which the nonbonded electron pair has
formed a hydrogen bond with a fourth residue. Note that endothelial
nitric oxide synthase, which lacks a P450 fold, has H-bonds between
the thiolate and the glycine two residues to its C-terminus and the
indole nitrogen of a tryptophan (Table ).

In view of the tetrahedral nature of the thiolate, the properties
of the putative additional hydrogen bonds between the thiolate and
backbone amides of residues one (X1) and three (X3) residues to its
C-terminus were examined (Table )., The H···S distance should be 0.2–0.5 Å
shorter than the sum of the vdw radii of the hydrogen and sulfur atom
(2.75 Å), and the N–H···S angle should
deviate less than 25° from linear. There is more variability
in the angles accepted for a hydrogen bond than in the distance between
the atoms. Because the vdw radius of a sulfur atom with its large
electron cloud is ∼0.4 Å greater than the radius of a
nitrogen (1.55 Å) and an oxygen (1.52 Å), the S···H–X
equilibrium length of a hydrogen bond between the sulfur and either
a nitrogen or oxygen heteroatom will be ∼3.5 versus ∼3
Å for a hydrogen bond involving a heteroatom.,

Table , which was constructed using
structures
of class I–IV P450s determined to a resolution of 2.5 Å
or better, indicates that in all four P450 classes only the conserved
glycine, two residues downstream of the thiolates, forms a hydrogen
bond with the thiolate in agreement with a previous study., The amides of the first and third residues after the thiolate do
not meet the criteria for hydrogen bond formation with the thiolate
in either P450s or endothelial NOS. Mutation of the conserved glycine
in the heme binding motif (FXXGXR/HXCXG) results in an inactive, unstable
apoprotein, supporting a key role for this glycine in binding the
heme and possibly also regulating the activity of P450s. The instability of the glycine mutant severely
limits an investigation of its exact role in catalysis (Figures  and ). Identification of
a single conserved hydrogen bond from a glycine two residues following
the thiolate of P450s likely explains the anomalous mutagenesis results
obtained in previous studies.,

Comparison
of the Interaction Energy between the Cys436 Thiolate
and His429 in Different Conformations and Protonation States
The total energy of interaction, Eint, between two objects is the sum of two terms: electrostatic (Eelec) and dispersion, that is, vdw (Edisp), forces. Eelec represents the energy due to electrostatic interactions of the point
charges of the residue with the heme–thiolate moiety (see the  for details of the theoretical
calculations).The Edisp data in Table  provide the energetic
contribution due to dispersion interactions (force between induced
diploes) of residue 429 with the thiolate and with the heme ring due
to an aromatic edge-to-face type interaction., It is seen that Edisp is slightly larger
for His429 than for Phe429. By contrast, the electrostatic interaction
is much larger when Phe429 is replaced with a histidine whose δN
atom can form a hydrogen bond with the thiolate. This interaction
is further enhanced if the εN atom of His429 is protonated to
form the positively charged imidazolium ion, which results in both
a strong H-bond and a significant electrostatic interaction (Eelec = −28.8 kcal/mol) on the heme–thiolate
moiety. To assess the role of the H-bond, we also rotated the imidazole
ring by 180° around the β-carbon so that it cannot form
an H-bond with the thiolate. As can be seen, the rotated doubly protonated
positively charged His429 (HSP) resembles the His orientation in BM3
F393H and has an enhanced electrostatic interaction (Eelec = −22.9 kcal/mol) (Figure A), while the neutral single protonated state (HSD) loses
its electrostatic interactions and experiences only weak vdw interactions
with the heme unit (Figure A). The contribution
of the interaction energy of Phe429 with the heme unit, including
both the heme ring and thiolate, is predominantly a vdw interaction
of an edge-to-face type as indicated in the dispersion energy column
(Edisp) in Table .− By contrast, in F429H, His429 interacts with the heme–thiolate
moiety by means of both vdw interactions and electrostatic interactions
mainly resulting from the H-bonding of His429 to the thiolate ligand.
The inhibitory effect of a histidine thiolate H-bond on P450 demonstrates
that the thiolate lone pair is sensitive to electrostatic modulations
and that phenylalanine plays an important role in protecting the thiolate
lone pair from assuming undesired electrostatic interactions in P450s.

colored blue, hydrogens gray, and sulfurs yellow. Water is shown as
a red sphere. Heme is shown with thin pink lines. In F429H, a hydrogen
bond is formed between the δN atom of His429 and the thiolate
of Cys436, whereas in F393H, a similar hydrogen bond is not present.
The εN atom of His429 forms hydrogen bonds with water and the
Gln357 side chain. (B) Tetrahedral configuration of Cys436 thiolate
in F429H/4-CPI. Hydrogen bonds are shown between Cys436 and His429
and Gly438.

The interactions of His with the heme–thiolate
moiety are
not constant and change somewhat along the catalytic cycle. Thus,
the Eint in the ferric peroxo species
of F429H reveals a stronger electrostatic interaction between the
His and heme–thiolate moiety compared with that in the resting
state [for HSD, neutral imidazole, and HSP, protonated positively
charged imidazolium, Eelec = −16.7
and −140.3 kcal/mol, respectively (Table S1 of the )]. The His–thiolate
interaction reduces the push effect of the thiolate and affects the
various catalytic species. Thus, at various stations along the cycle,
the F429H mutation engages in a variable interaction with the heme–thiolate
moiety, which could affect the rate and thermodynamics of the step., However, because the experimental results show that both the WT
and the mutants give rise to formation of the hydroperoxo intermediate,
very different activity must exist where O–O bond cleavage
occurs. Our recent theoretical calculations
showed that the hydrogen bond donated by His429 to the thiolate reduces
the electron density on the heme iron and impairs O–O bond
cleavage and creates a tendency for homolytic bond O–O bond
breaking instead of generating compound I by the heterolytic pathway. By contrast, the effect of Phe429 is weak and
the interaction with the heme–thiolate moiety does not impair
the electronic push effect of the thiolate in causing heterolytic
O–O bond cleavage.

Discussion
Comparison
of the Structures of CYP2B4 F429H to Those of Class
I and II P450s
To gain insight into the crucial role of Phe429
in P450 catalysis, we have compared the characteristics of the P450
F429H mutant to those of other mutant and wild type P450s lacking
the conserved phenylalanine. The most thoroughly investigated homologous
phenylalanine to histidine mutant (F393H) is from P450 BM3.,− The F393H protein (1) has a 95 mV more positive redox
potential and (2) is also reduced more quickly by the reductase. (3)
However, it lacks an H-bond between the thiolate and the histidine.
This is consistent with the EPR and resonance Raman spectra, which
are similar to those of the wild type proteins. CYP2B4 F429H also
has an 87 mV higher potential and is reduced more quickly by its reductase.
However, an H-bond between the histidine and thiolate was observed
crystallographically and was detected in the EPR and resonance Raman
spectra of the F429H mutant.,,, Overall, the properties of the
F429H mutant can be attributed to the electron withdrawing effect
of the His–thiolate H-bond. In contrast, the structure of the
heme domain of the BM3 F393H mutant would not fully account for all
of the properties of the F393H mutant protein even if the histidine
were protonated. However, a protonated cationic histidine (HSP) is
not expected on the hydrophobic proximal surface of P450 BM3. In addition,
an electron withdrawing effect on the heme iron strong enough to increase
the potential, enhance heme reduction, stabilize the oxyferrous intermediate,
and decrease activity would be expected to be reflected in the resonance
Raman and EPR spectra. One possible explanation for the discrepancy
is that the structure of the F393H mutant heme domain is different
in the holoprotein.

The analogous F338H mutant of CYP121 is
a notable exception to there being a critical role for the phenylalanine
in redox potential modulation (PDB entry 1N40). It is atypical in that its redox properties
are primarily controlled by the active site residue, Arg386. Therefore, while the phenylalanine has been
retained by CYP121, it no longer plays a critical role in the catalytic
mechanism. P450cin is yet another variation. The phenylalanine
is replaced with a leucine, yet the protein functions as a monooxygenase. In P450cam, the corresponding mutant,
Phe350His, has not been crystallized and investigated to only a limited
extent. The activity is decreased by ∼85%.

Comparison of the Structures of CYP2B4 F429H
to Those of Class
III and IV P450s
There are three major categories of class
III enzymes that employ oxygen-containing substrates or hydrogen peroxide
but neither oxygen nor a redox partner. They are distinguished by
the substrates they employ and the reactions they catalyze (summarized
in Table ). P450 SPα (CYP152B1) and
BSβ (CYP152A1), in the first group, hydroxylate the carbon–hydrogen
bonds of fatty acids presumably via a compound I intermediate by employing
H2O2 and the salt bridge formed between the
carboxylate of the substrate and an active site arginine., (Table ). The phenylalanine is replaced
with glutamine, whose side chain amide forms a hydrogen bond with
the axial thiolate. The likely explanation for compound I formation
is a strong “pull” on electron density from the distal
side of the heme as in peroxidases.

Allene oxide synthases (CYP74A),
the second type of class III P450s,
convert unsaturated fatty acid alkyl hydroperoxides into epoxides
by dehydration, probably employing a compound II (Fe4+OH–) equivalent rather than compound I (Table ). They are alkyl hydroperoxide dehydratases., A tryptophan whose hydrogen on the aromatic ζ-carbon is in
vdw contact with the thiolate replaces the conserved phenylalanine.
On the distal side of the heme, the conserved I helix kink at the
AGXET motif has shifted by three residues toward the N-terminus. An
Asn side chain amide forms an H-bond with the iron-bound proximal
oxygen of the substrate, which facilitates homolytic cleavage of the
peroxide and formation of an epoxide (allene oxide) and water.

Prostacyclin synthase (CYP8A1) and thromboxane synthase (CYP5A1)
are the third major type of class III P450s (Table ). They both catalyze the isomerization, which proceeds via
a Fe(IV)–porphyrin and alkoxy radical, of the same endoperoxide
substrate, prostaglandin H2, to two different epoxides
that are key regulators of blood coagulation. The phenylalanine of
prostacyclin synthase is replaced with a tryptophan whose benzene
ring is in contact with the thiolate and heme., The I helix AGXET sequence has mutated to ATQGN. Thromboxane synthase
(CYP5A1), which, amazingly, is 57% similar to human CYP3A4, possesses
the conserved phenylalanine, and its
conserved active site I helix motif has been retained except for the
replacement of the conserved threonine with an isoleucine. The comparison
made above illustrates that P450s with drastically different sequences
and, presumably, structures can nonetheless employ the identical substrate
and catalyze a similar but distinct reaction.

Nitric oxide reductase
(CYP 55, P450 NOR) is a class IV P450 that
does not catalyze an oxidation; rather, it catalyzes the reduction
of two molecules of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O) and H2O. NAD(P)H transfers a hydride ion directly to
the nitric oxide-bound heme, a two-electron acceptor. Its heme pocket
motif, including the conserved phenylalanine, has been preserved (Table ). The partially
conserved active site I helix motif (AGNAT) stereospecifically binds
NADPH but does not participate in proton delivery.

In summary,
comparison of the mutant structure to structures of
other P450s leads to the following conclusions. In class I and II
P450s, the conserved phenylalanine is typically critical to the activity
and thermodynamic properties of the protein while residues on the
distal side of the heme are primarily involved in proton delivery
and substrate binding. However, selected proteins (CYP121 and nitric
oxide reductase) retain the phenylalanine but employ residues on the
distal side of the heme to regulate the redox properties and the catalytic
mechanism. The diverse class III P450s, typically alkyl hydroperoxide
isomerases, often replace the phenylalanine with a tryptophan and
redesign the distal heme pockets to perform the required plethora
of biochemical transformations.

Notably, all four classes of
P450s typically retain a conserved
aromatic amino acid whose partially positive edge contacts both the
thiolate where its nonbonded electron pair is predicted to occur and
the partially negative face of the heme in an edge-to-face conformation.
In this position, it is expected to protect the thiolate lone pair
and the heme from side reactions, such as H-bond formation, with chemical
entities and solvent. Additional functions (inhibition of oxidation
and protonation of cysteine) of the phenylalanine and heme binding
motif can be inferred from studies that have introduced a thiolate
into a different proximal surface scaffold. Replacing the axial histidine
of cyt c peroxidase, heme oxygenase, and myoglobin
with cysteine resulted in oxidation of the cysteine to cysteic acid
in cyt c peroxidase, while the cysteine in heme oxygenase
and myoglobin became protonated and did not bind the ferrous heme
as a result of exposure to bulk solvent.− Significant
monooxygenase activity was not observed in any of the histidine to
cysteine mutants. Understanding how P450s employ diverse, finely tuned
protein environments to mediate their catalytic activities will aid
scientists in designing novel pharmaceuticals and creating enzymes
that can extend the chemical repertoire of natural P450s.
