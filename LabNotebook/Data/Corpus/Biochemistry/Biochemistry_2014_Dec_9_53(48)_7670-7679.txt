β-Lactam
resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii presents one
of the greatest challenges to contemporary antimicrobial chemotherapy.
Much of this resistance to cephalosporins derives from the expression
of the class C β-lactamase enzymes, known as Acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases (ADCs). Currently, β-lactamase inhibitors
are structurally similar to β-lactam substrates and are not
effective inactivators of this class C cephalosporinase. Herein, two boronic acid transition state inhibitors
(BATSIs S02030 and SM23) that are chemically distinct from β-lactams
were designed and tested for inhibition of ADC enzymes. BATSIs SM23
and S02030 bind with high affinity to ADC-7, a chromosomal cephalosporinase
from Acinetobacter baumannii (Ki = 21.1 ± 1.9 nM and 44.5 ± 2.2 nM, respectively).
The X-ray crystal structures of ADC-7 were determined in both the
apo form (1.73 Å resolution) and in complex with S02030 (2.0
Å resolution). In the complex, S02030 makes several canonical
interactions: the O1 oxygen of S02030 is bound in the oxyanion hole,
and the R1 amide group makes key interactions with conserved residues
Asn152 and Gln120. In addition, the carboxylate group of the inhibitor
is meant to mimic the C3/C4 carboxylate found
in β-lactams. The C3/C4 carboxylate recognition
site in class C enzymes is comprised of Asn346 and Arg349 (AmpC numbering),
and these residues are conserved in ADC-7. Interestingly, in the ADC-7/S02030
complex, the inhibitor carboxylate group is observed to interact with
Arg340, a residue that distinguishes ADC-7 from the related class
C enzyme AmpC. A thermodynamic analysis suggests that ΔH driven compounds may be optimized to generate
new lead agents. The ADC-7/BATSI complex provides insight into recognition
of non-β-lactam inhibitors by ADC enzymes and offers a starting
point for the structure-based optimization of this class of novel
β-lactamase inhibitors against a key resistance target.

β-Lactam resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii presents one of the greatest and most pressing challenges to contemporary
antimicrobial chemotherapy. In just the past 8 years, resistance to
all classes of β-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems;
Figure 1A) among clinical isolates of A. baumannii has significantly increased.1−5 Varieties of mechanisms working alone and in combination
(β-lactamases, porins, efflux pumps, etc.) contribute to this
clinically treacherous phenotype. Among these factors, β-lactamases
of multiple classes (A, B, C, and D) are the primary determinants
responsible for β-lactam resistance in Acinetobacter
spp. As a consequence, these pathogens present a serious
challenge to successful antimicrobial chemotherapy, especially in
patients who are elderly, immunocompromised, or most recently, suffer
serious military war wounds. Mortality rates are high and disability
is prolonged.2,4,6

acid, a β-lactam-based β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI). (C)
Novel boronic acid transition state analog inhibitors (BATSIs).

A way to overcome β-lactamase-mediated
resistance in A. baumannii is through the design
of β-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs). Clavulanate, sulbactam, and
tazobactam (Figure 1B) are BLIs that are commercially
available and have enjoyed more than 30 years of use.7 BLIs co-opt the mechanism of catalysis and use the chemistry
that occurs between the BLI (that mimics the β-lactam) and the
residues in the active site to thwart the enzyme’s versatile
catalytic machinery. Unfortunately, these commercially available BLIs
do not inhibit the A. baumannii cephalosporinase
effectively enough to allow the β-lactam antibiotic to reach
its cellular target, the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs).1 Although novel bridged diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octanone
non-BLIs, DBOs, are in development as potential BLIs of class C enzymes
(e.g., avibactam and MK-7660), they are not yet targeted for A. baumannii. As a consequence, the class D oxacillinases,
carbapenemases, and permeability factors severely limit their use.8 New approaches in BLI design are needed to overcome
this complex β-lactamase background in Acinetobacter spp. and this formidable clinical threat.9

With respect to A. baumannii, studies seeking
to understand the mechanistic details of cephalosporinase structure–function
relationships to aid in the design of novel BLIs are in their infancy.
The cephalosporinase of A. baumannii (or Acinetobacterderived cephalosporinase, ADC) is a chromosomally
encoded class C β-lactamase that is responsible for resistance
to penicillins, cephalosporins, and β-lactam/BLI combinations.10 Unlike other class C enzymes, which are inducible,
ADC cephalosporinase expression is constitutive, driven by both its
native promoter and insertion sequences that cause a highly expressed
enzyme and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that exceed serum
levels of expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Early work on ADC-7 β-lactamase
demonstrated remarkably high kcat for
first-generation cephalosporins and a relatively high Km for the commercially available BLIs.10 Importantly, substantial phylogenetic distance separated blaADC-7 (and other blaADCs) from ampC genes and supported the development
of targeted therapies specific for Acinetobacter cephalosporinases.9,10

The rapid development of whole genome sequencing revealed
the immense diversity of ADCs in A. baumannii.11 Presently, the genetic/amino acid sequences
of more than 240 unique enzymes in this class C family are catalogued.
Interestingly, comparative whole genome sequencing has also shown
that blaADC resides in a locus that is
highly variable.12 These observations raise
the concern that sequence variability may play an important survival
role in resistance to β-lactams in A. baumannii. The hypothesis has been advanced that the amino acids in the active
site serve overlapping roles in the recognition of β-lactam
antibiotics.13 The notion of “enzyme
plasticity” may explain why ADC β-lactamase variants
evolve with novel or expanded catalytic properties (such as ADC-56)
and remains to be tested.14

To provide
a template for effective inhibitor design efforts against this important
resistance target, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the
ADC-7 cephalosporinase. This enzyme was chosen because significant
work had already been performed probing the active site with different
inhibitors.13 In studies performed previously, boronic acids were shown to be
effective transition state analogue inhibitors of ADC-7 (here referred
to as BATSIs).13 Using strategically designed
BATSIs, a chiral cephalothin analogue with a meta-carboxyphenyl moiety
corresponding to the C3/C4 carboxylate of β-lactams
showed the lowest Ki (21 ± 1 nM)
for ADC-7 (SM23, Figure 1C). These findings
led to the further development of these important BATSIs. The present
analysis describes the kinetic characterization of the novel BATSI,
S02030, the carboxytriazole derivative of SM23. With these important
milestones, we are now poised to explore the structure/function relationship
in ADC-7 for optimization of the BATSIs as important Acinetobacter class C inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis and Chemical
Analysis
General Methods
SM23 was synthesized as already described.15 The synthesis of the new S02030 was performed
following the pathway depicted in Scheme 1.
The highly stereoselective homologation of (+)-pinanediol azidomethaneboronate 2 allowed for the desired configuration at the asymmetrically
substituted boron bearing carbon atom, while the azide group in 5 facilitated the formation of the triazole ring by the highly
efficient copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuCAAC).
Compound 2 was obtained through chlorine substitution
of 1(16) with sodium azide,
catalyzed by tetrabutylammonium iodide as the phase transfer agent
(97%).17 Subsequent treatment with in situ generated dichloromethyl lithium at −100
°C allowed the introduction in 3 of a halogenated
carbon on the previous carbon–boron bond; the use of (+)-pinanediol
as a chiral auxiliary agent allows for the desired S configuration with high diastereoselectivity (d.e. &gt;98%, 96%).18−22 Treatment with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, performed at −100
°C to minimize elimination reaction, produced the intermediate 4 (80%) with clean inversion of the configuration. This latter
compound was then deprotected at nitrogen with a stoichiometric amount
of methanol and coupled with thiophenacetyl chloride to afford compound 5 (62%).

acid, HCl, acetonitrile, n-hexane, r.t, 3h, 98%.

For assembling the “right part of the
molecule,” we employed the copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition
between the azido group in 5 and propiolic acid, exploiting
copper catalysis to gain regioselectivity and microwave irradiation
to increase efficiency.23−25 The synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted
triazole 6 (60%) was confirmed by multinuclear bidimensional
NMR spectroscopy. Final deprotection of (+)-pinanediol was accomplished
by transesterification with phenylboronic acid in a biphasic system
of acetonitrile/n-hexane,26 to afford the final BATSI S02030 in 98% yield.27 NMR spectra of all intermediates are reported in the Supporting Information.

Disc Susceptibility Assays (DSAs) and Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations
(MICs)
DSAs were performed according to Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines.28 Bacterial cultures were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth
supplemented with 20 μg/mL of chloramphenicol to ensure maintenance
of the β-lactamase plasmid in pBC SK (−) containing Escherichia coli strains. Bacterial liquid culture was then
diluted using MH broth to a McFarland Standard (optical density600 (OD600) = 0.224). Bacteria were streaked onto
a plate composed of MH agar and a disc containing 10 μg of compound
and 10 μg of ampicillin. Plates were incubated overnight at
37 °C, and on the following day, zone sizes were measured.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility (MICs)
Susceptibility profiles
were determined by cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton agar dilution MICs
according to the CLSI standards previously described.10 We employed the E. coli construct that
was previously validated as a representative of ADC-7 in a uniform
genetic background (blaADC-7 was directionally cloned in
pBC SK (−) phagemid vector under the control of a strong promoter)
and a clinical strain A. baumannii M9, a multidrug
resistant (MDR) strain. For the ceftazidime/BATSI combinations, the
substrate concentrations were varied while the inhibitors were tested
at a constant concentration of 4 μg/mL.

Protein Preparation and
Purification
In order to remove the potentially disordered
hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide, a version of ADC-7 starting
at amino acid 24 was subcloned into pET28a(+) (without a His-tag).
The resulting plasmid that expressed amino acids D24-K383 of ADC-7
β-lactamase was transformed into the E. coli expression strain BL21(DE3). The cells were grown in lysogeny broth,
LB, with 25 μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C until the OD600 was ∼0.8. Expression of the ADC-7 β-lactamase was induced
by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). After an additional 2 h of growth at 37 °C, the cells
were centrifuged (8000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min), and the cell
pellets were stored at −80 °C.

For the purification
of ADC-7, cell pellets were suspended in 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.5
M NaCl with 1× HALT protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and DNase
I (50 Units). The solution was sonicated for 4 × 30 s intervals
on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 15000 rpm at 4 °C for 20
min. The cell-free extract (supernatant) was then mixed gently with m-aminophenylboronic acid resin (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C.
The resin/supernatant mixture was poured into a column and washed
with a loading buffer of 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl. ADC-7
was then eluted with 0.5 M NaCl, 300 mM borate, pH 7.0. The fractions
containing ADC-7 were collected, pooled, and then dialyzed in 2 ×
5 L of 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0 at 4 °C. The dialyzed ADC-7
was concentrated to at least 10 mg/mL using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal
filter unit with Ultra-10 membrane (Millipore). The concentration
of ADC-7 was determined using the A280 with an extinction coefficient of 46 300 M–1 cm–1, as calculated for the expressed residues
D24-K383 of ADC-7 by the ProtParam tool on the ExPASy bioinformatics
portal.29

ADC-7 X-ray Structure Determination
Crystals of ADC-7 were grown at room temperature via hanging drop
vapor diffusion using the following conditions: ADC-7 (3 mg/mL) in
25% w/v polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500, 0.1 M succinate/phosphate/glycine
buffer at pH 5.0 (SPG buffer, Molecular Dimensions). Crystals of ADC-7
were harvested from the crystallization drop with a nylon loop and
immediately cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were measured from
a single crystal at the LS-CAT sector (21-ID-F beamline) of the Advanced
Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne, IL). To obtain
the ADC-7/S02030 complex, preformed ADC-7 crystals were harvested
and placed in a drop of well buffer supplemented with 1 mM S02030
and soaked for approximately 5–10 min before cryocooling in
liquid nitrogen. The inhibitor was diluted into crystallization buffer
from a 50 mM stock solution dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Data were measured from a single crystal at LS-CAT (21-ID-G beamline).
Images from the apo data set were indexed, integrated, and scaled
with HKL200030 and with XDS31 for the complex. For the apo structure, molecular
replacement was performed with Phaser32 using a homology model generated with Phyre2.33 This model is based on the structure of the AmpC from Pseudomonas fluorescens (2QZ6) and was chosen due to its
high sequence identity to ADC-7.34 For
the ADC-7/S02030 complex, the apo ADC-7 structure (all waters and
ions removed) was used as the initial phasing model in Phaser. Refinement
was performed using Refmac535 in the CCP4
program suite.36 Iterative rounds of model
building were done in Coot.37 The coordinates
and structure factors for the final ADC-7 model and the ADC-7/S02030
complex are deposited with the Protein Data Bank as 4U0T and 4U0X, respectively.

Steady State Kinetics
Steady state kinetics assays were
performed on a Cary 100 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies)
in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 2 nM ADC-7. The Vmax and Km of the
β-lactam substrate nitrocefin (NCF) for ADC-7 were determined
from initial steady-state velocities using this colorimetric indicator
(NCF, Δε482 = 17400 M–1 cm–1). The kinetic parameters for ADC-7 were obtained
using iterative nonlinear least-squares fit of the data to the Henri-Michaelis
equation using GraphPad Prism 6.0 according to eq 1: 1  

Presently, the experimental evidence suggests
that the inactivation of β-lactamases by BATSIs proceeds along
the following mechanism,38 where E is the
enzyme, I is the BATSI, E:I represents an equilibrium binding complex,
and E-I* represents a covalent, reversible complex that mimics either
the acylation or deacylation transition state observed in the hydrolysis
of a typical β-lactam substrate:39−41  

The Ki for the BATSI inhibitors
was determined by measuring initial steady-state velocities in the
presence of a constant concentration of enzyme (2 nM) with increasing
concentrations of inhibitor against the indicator substrate NCF (60
μM). In all assays, the measurements of initial velocities were
performed with the addition of NCF after a 5 min preincubation of
enzyme with inhibitor, as described in previous studies.15,40,42−44 The average
velocities (v0) were then fitted to eq 2, where vu represents
the reporter’s (NCF) uninhibited velocity and Ki(observed) represents the inhibitor
concentration that results in a 50% reduction of vu. 2  

Ki values were corrected for nitrocefin
affinity (Km = 21.2 μM) according
to eq 3: 3  

Circular
Dichroism (CD)
Thermal denaturation and stability CD experiments
were performed in a Jasco J-815 spectrometer (Easton, MD) with a Peltier
effect temperature controller (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Quartz
cells with a 0.1 cm path length (Hellma, New York) were used for all
experiments. Spectra were obtained with an ADC-7 concentration of
10 μM. Compounds were tested at a concentration of 200 μM
to ensure that they did not interfere with the refraction of the light
by the protein in the far UV spectrum.

Thermal melting was performed
between 22 and 75 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C/min. Raw
equilibrium denaturation data, monitored by far-UV CD at 221 nm, were
normalized to the fraction of denatured protein (fu), and the data were used for calculations of melting
temperature Tm (see Supplementary Figure 2, Supporting Information). To determine
if the thermal denaturation of ADC-7 follows a two-state process,
the sample was monitored for changes in tertiary structure in the
near-UV region, at 270 nm (data not shown), as previously described
by Beadle et. al.45 The melting for near-UV
CD was performed using 30 μg/mL ADC-7 and a heating rate of
2 °C/min.

Thermodynamic Parameters Determination by
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments for
investigation of the binding affinity of ADC-7 for BATSIs were performed
using a MicroCal (GE Healthcare) VP-ITC microcalorimeter. All measurements
were taken at 25 °C in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). ADC-7
β-lactamase and all ligand solutions were prepared in the same
phosphate buffer (see Supplementary Figure 3 for a representative binding reaction of ADC-7 with SM23).

The protein concentration was determined using ε280 of 46 300 M–1 cm–1, and
the concentration of the BATSI was determined by weight. The 1.47
mL sample cell was filled with a 9–12 μM protein solution
and the 300 μL injection syringe with a 0.25–0.5 mM BATSI
solution that was injected at a rate of 5 μL every 210 s into
the sample cell. All titrations were performed with a stirring speed
of 307 rpm. The initial injection was not used for data fitting. Titrations
were run past the point of enzyme saturation to determine and correct
for heat of dilution. The data were fit using the One Set of Sites
model provided with Origin 7.0 to determine Ka (1/KD),ΔH, ΔS, and n (number of sites). The raw ITC data represent the heat generated
by the enzyme upon converting n moles of substrate
to product and is dependent on the Mt (free
concentration of the enzyme), Xt (free
concentration of the ligand), θ (fraction of sites occupied
by ligand), and the V0 (sample cell volume).46−49 The Gibbs free energy ΔG was calculated with eq 4. 4  

Results
Kinetics,
Biophysical Characterization, and Microbiology
 In order
to assess the binding affinity of ADC-7 with the two boronic acid
transition state inhibitors, S02030 and SM23, kinetic analyses were
performed using nitrocefin as an indicator substrate. As shown in
Table 1, both compounds were potent inhibitors
of ADC-7 and demonstrated relatively high binding affinity to the
enzyme (SM23: Ki = 21.1
± 1.9 nM; S02030: Ki = 44.5 ± 2.2 nM).

Along with the kinetic analyses
that demonstrated that SM23 and S02030 can inhibit the ability of
ADC-7 to hydrolyze nitrocefin, thermal stability and thermodynamic
analysis were applied to further understand the contributions of the
R1 and R2 side chains to binding. Investigating the changes in enthalpy
(ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of binding energy can provide insights
into the optimization of side chain interactions to increase the affinity
(KD) between an enzyme and new ligands.
In the case of SM23 and S02030 (Table 1), both
compounds have favorable enthalpies (ΔHSM23 = −5.4 ± 0.3 kcal/mol and ΔHS02030 = −9.3 ± 0.5 kcal/mol) and relative
similar binding energies (ΔGSM23 = –9.61 ± 0.5 kcal/mol and ΔGS02030 = –8.51 ±
0.3 kcal/mol). For S02030, which has a slightly less favorable binding
energy than SM23 (∼0.7 kcal/mol), the higher enthalpy compensates
for the loss in entropy (ΔSSM23 = 14.1 ± 0.5 cal/mol·K,
vs ΔSS02030 = −2.76 ±
0.1 cal/mol·K). This examination suggests that enthalpically
driven compounds may be optimized by introducing additional conformational
constraints and/or hydrophobic groups.

Representative two-state
thermal denaturation of ADC-7 with and without the inhibitors was
monitored by far-UV CD at 221 nm (Figure S2A). The melting temperature (Tm) for ADC-7
was ∼61 ± 1 °C at 221 nm (60 ± 1 °C at
270 nm), and for the complexes, the Tm was ∼64 ± 1 °C and ∼65 ± 1 °C
for SM23 and S02030, respectively. These melting temperatures were
similar for far-UV and near-UV spectrum, suggesting two-state thermal
denaturation. Comparison of the CD spectrum of ADC-7 with that of
ADC-7/SM23 showed differences in signal ellipticity that suggests
subtle conformational changes induced by the inhibitor upon binding
(Figure S2B).

To test if the inhibitors
were active against bacteria expressing ADC-7, disc susceptibility
assays (DSAs) were performed and MIC values were determined. In a
uniform E. coli DH10B genetic background, excellent
inhibition of ADC-7 β-lactamase by the BATSIs is observed at
a concentration of 10 μg/mL when coupled with the β-lactam
ceftazidime (CAZ; Table 2). The DSA zone sizes
increased from 12 mm for CAZ alone to 25 and 26 mm for SM23 and S02030,
respectively. An achiral BATSI that contains the R1 side chain found
in SM23 and S02030 but lacks an R2 side chain was also tested to explore
the importance of the R2 side chain (Figure 1C). For the achiral BATSI, the zone
size was also increased, but not as substantially as with the chiral
BATSIs (17 mm vs 25 and 26 mm). Using a fixed concentration of the
BATSIs (4 μg/mL), the MIC values were shown to decrease from
64 μg/mL to 8 μg/mL (for SM23 and S02030) and 32 μg/mL
(for the achiral BATSI) (Table 3). In an A. baumannii background (strain M9 from which blaADC was initially cloned), we also see a reduction of
MIC values from &gt;64 to 16 μg/mL for S02030. The latter result
is most encouraging as the lack of permeability across the outer membrane
of A. baumannii is a significant challenge in medicinal
chemistry.

X-ray Crystal Structures
of apo ADC-7 and in Complex with Boronic Acid Inhibitor S02030
The structure of apo ADC-7 was determined to 1.73 Å resolution
(Figure 2; Table 4).
ADC-7 crystallized in the P1 space group with eight
molecules in the asymmetric unit. A phosphate ion was observed in
the active sites of each of the eight monomers of the asymmetric unit
(Figure 2). The quality of the final model
was evaluated with MolProbity.50 In this
model, 97.1% of all residues were in the favored region of the Ramachandran
plot, and 99.9% were in the allowed region. The final R and Rfree were 19.6% and 24.0%, respectively,
and the coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the
Protein Data Bank as 4U0T. The overall fold of ADC-7 is a mixed α/β structure
and resembles that observed in other class C β-lactamases, including
the recently determined structure of ADC-1.51

To better understand the structural
basis for inhibition of ADC-7 by BATSIs, the X-ray crystal structure
of the ADC-7/S02030 complex was determined to 2.03 Å resolution
(Figure 3; Table 4).
The complex was obtained by soaking the inhibitor into preformed ADC-7
crystals. The space group was P21, with
four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Inspection of the initial Fo – Fc maps
contoured at 3σ showed unambiguous electron density for the
inhibitor bound in the active site of all four molecules. The density
was contiguous with the Oγ atom of Ser64, suggesting that the
inhibitor was covalently attached to the catalytic serine residue.
The inhibitor molecule was built into the density in all active sites
and further refined with Refmac5. 2Fo – Fc maps calculated from the refined model confirmed
the covalent attachment to Ser64. A tetrahedral geometry was observed
around the boron atom of the inhibitor. In addition to the four inhibitors,
the final model of the complex contained 1,421 protein residues and
668 water molecules. The final R and Rfree were 19.6% and 24.0%, respectively, and the coordinates
and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
as 4U0X.

contoured at 1.0 σ and colored gray. (B) Hydrogen bonding interactions
observed between ADC-7 and the boronic acid inhibitor S02030. The
active site shown is the C monomer (the inhibitor in the B monomer
binds similarly). Hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions are shown
as yellow dashed lines and represent distances between 2.6–3.3
Å. Water molecules are indicated with red spheres. Carbon atoms
of the active site residues are colored salmon, oxygens red, nitrogens
blue, sulfurs yellow, and boron is light pink.

The quality of the model was analyzed with MolProbity, with
96.2% of all of the residues found in the favored region of the Ramachandran
plot and 99.7% in the allowed region. B factors for each of the monomers
were calculated with Moleman2,52 and these
values ranged from 23.5 Å2 (B monomer) to 41.4 Å2 (D monomer).

Superposition of each of the monomers
reveals that S02030 binds in similar, but not identical, orientations
in each of the sites (Figure 4). The overall
conformation of the inhibitors is the same with the R1 and R2 groups
forming favorable intramolecular van der Waals interactions. Other
similarities include the tetrahedral geometry around the boron atom
and the position of the R1 group in the active site that is analogous
to where the R1 side chains of β-lactam substrates bind in other
class C β-lactamases. The O1 hydroxyl group is positioned in
the oxyanion hole and makes a favorable hydrogen bond with the main
chain nitrogen of Ser315 (2.8 Å) and long hydrogen bonds to the
main chain nitrogen of Ser64 and main chain oxygen of Ser315 (3.2–3.4
Å). The R1 amide group interacts with the side chain nitrogens
of Gln120 and Asn152 and the main chain oxygen of Ser315. The thiophene
ring in the R1 side chain is in an identical conformation in the B
and D monomers. In the C monomer the ring is rotated approximately
180° around the C12–C13 bond from the orientation observed
in A and D monomers. Electron density supports the existence of two
alternate conformations for the ring in the A monomer. One is the
same as the conformation in monomers A and D, and the other differs
by an approximate 120° rotation around C12–C13. Regardless,
the thiophene ring is not involved in any significant interactions
with the enzyme.

Figure 4 Overlay of the S02030 inhibitor conformations in all four
ADC-7 active sites. The R1 side chain binds similarly in all four
conformations. Differences arise in the placement of the inhibitor
R2 group (carboxytriazole) and its interaction with Arg340. In monomers
B (purple) and C (salmon), the R2 group adopts similar conformations
and interacts with Arg340, which is observed in a single conformation.
In monomers A (white) and D (orange), the conformations of the inhibitor
are somewhat different, and alternate and/or multiple conformations
of Arg340 are also observed.

Where larger differences are observed is in the position
of the inhibitor R2 group. In two of the monomers (A and C), the R2
carboxytriazole groups are in similar positions, interacting favorably
with Arg340 (∼2.6–3.3 Å). The inhibitor in the
D monomer is rotated approximately 150° around C7–C8,
placing its carboxylate group in a different region of the active
site; the carboxylate carbon atom (C21) has moved ∼4.5 Å
from its position in the A and C monomers. Yet the R2 group still
maintains interactions with Arg340 in one of two observed alternate
conformations for this residue. In the A monomer, the R2 group has
rotated to an intermediate position between the B/C and D locations,
with the C21 atom displaced 3.6 Å from its position in B/C and
2.1 Å from its D position.

Discussion
ADC-7
is a class C β-lactamase target in the clinically relevant Acinetobacter spp. Here we show that BATSIs SM23 and S02030
bind to ADC-7 with high affinity and have the ability to act synergistically
with β-lactams to overcome resistance in bacteria that express
ADC-7. This is extremely encouraging as the penetration of both antibiotics
and inhibitors into the cell represents a significant challenge in
medicinal chemistry.

Boronic acids present a starting point
for the development of this class of molecules as novel inhibitors
in the particularly troublesome species. In this context, we could
exploit the potential of click chemistry as a powerful tool in drug
discovery. The term “click” is reserved to the “near-perfect”
reaction, and CuCAAC is the click reaction par excellence. The high degree of dependability and flexibility of this method
allows for the rapid synthesis of compound libraries for SAR profiling,
accelerating both lead identification and optimization.53−55 From a synthetic point of view, the application of CuCAAC was a
key step in obtaining the compound S02030 and offers potentially easy
access to a wide range of substituted triazoles, useful not only for
further exploration of structure–activity relationship, but
also for enhanced cell penetration. In our case, from the key 2-azido-1-acylamino-ethaneboronate
intermediate 5, we have the opportunity to generate a
library of new BATSIs exploring different substituents on the triazole
ring, with terminal acetylene accessibility the only potential limitation.

Importantly, BATSIs do not resemble β-lactams, and yet SM23
and S02030 bind with high affinity to ADC-7 (Ki values of 21.1 and 44.5 nM, respectively).
The original intent for determining the ADC-7/S02030 complex was to
understand the interactions responsible for this affinity. AmpC has
been extensively characterized with respect to inhibition by boronic
acids.56 Many of these interactions identified
in AmpC/BATSI complexes are conserved in the ADC-7 complex with S02030,
for example the oxyanion/hydroxyl hole and the R1 amide recognition
site. These features are likely to be generally applicable to boronic
acid inhibition of ADC enzymes.

The next step is to improve
the properties of S02030 so that the high affinity also translates
into increased activity against resistant bacteria. Unlike the achiral
cephalothin BATSI from which they are derived, SM23 and S02030 contain
both an R1 and an R2 group (Figure 1C). These
two regions are important for exploring different areas of the active
site, as well as for identifying important inhibitor recognition sites
to aid in future optimization efforts. Focusing first on the R2 group,
the ADC-7/S02030 complex showed differences in S02030 binding, coupled
with multiple Arg340 conformations (Figure 4) in each of the four monomers of ADC-7. This lack of a single consensus
binding mode for the inhibitor suggests that the R2 carboxylate group
of S02030 may be too close to Arg340, resulting in a steric clash
between this residue and the carboxylate group of the inhibitor. From
the AmpC/SM23 (PDB 1MXO) comparison, removal of the carbon linker may place the carboxylate
in an ideal position for a favorable interaction with Arg340 (Figure 5). The shorter R2 group of SM23 may allow for a
favorable and stabilizing interaction with Arg340 and may explain
why SM23 has a higher affinity for ADC-7.

Figure 5 Superposition of ADC-7/S02030
(salmon) complex with AmpC/SM23 (white). Boronic acid inhibitor (SM23)
is bound to the AmpC active site and highlights the position of the
inhibitor’s carboxylate group that is meant to mimic the corresponding
group common to β-lactams.

Given the notable absence of favorable interactions with
the R1 group of S02030, an obvious next step to potentially optimize
S02030 is to introduce favorable interactions in this region. Several
residues in this region offer the possibility of making more productive
interactions with an inhibitor. For example, Gln120 and Ser317 are
both located near the thiophene ring of S02030. Addition of a carboxylate
group or a tetrazole ring in this region might allow for interactions
with one or both of these residues. Both of these additions have been
shown to improve the affinity of related BATSIs.57,58 Additionally, replacing the thiophene ring with a phenyl ring might
introduce favorable quadrupole–quadrupole interactions with
Tyr222, another feature important for recognition of arylboronic acids
by other class C enzymes.56

In closing,
there is a pressing need for the development of novel inhibitors for
the class C enzymes in Acinetobacter spp. to overcome
β-lactam mediated resistance. These initial BATSIs provide an
excellent starting point with high binding affinities for ADC-7 and
antimicrobial activity against resistant bacteria expressing ADC-7.
Analysis of the first structure of an ADC enzyme in complex with a
BATSI suggests areas that could be exploited in these optimization
efforts. Interestingly, the applications of thermodynamic parameters
in the analysis of these reversible inhibitors represent another approach
to improve inhibitor design. Here, we see early indications that enthalpies
can be a driving force in enzyme–inhibitor interactions. The
data derived from ITC and CD provide a thermodynamic basis for the
SAR of the newly described inhibitors and nicely complement the data
derived from the X-ray crystal structures. This more complete understanding
of the SAR will guide future strategies for novel BATSI analogue design.
