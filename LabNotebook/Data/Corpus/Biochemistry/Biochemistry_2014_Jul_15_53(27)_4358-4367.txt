Oligomerization of proteins
in biological systems is a common phenomenon, and protein–protein
interactions are often involved in critical cellular processes. The
destabilization of interfaces in multimeric protein complexes is thought
to contribute to diseases ranging from neurodegenerative disorders
to muscular dystrophy.− Because proteins rarely act alone in vivo, predicting networks of protein–protein interactions, i.e.,
the “interactome”, has become fundamental to the development
of systems biology.− As a consequence, predicting how any given protein
will interact with other biomolecules, understanding the forces stabilizing
protein–protein interfaces, and learning how to destabilize
an individual interface have become the focus of much research.−

One of the most common protein–protein interactions
is self-association., In essence, this allows a single
gene of relatively short length
to encode a large protein system by allowing multiple peptide sequences
encoded from that gene to interact and form a large multimeric protein.
In addition to a reduced genome and fewer problems with transcription,
this system provides benefits such as an increase in the effective
concentration within the cell, enhanced protein stability, and additional
regulatory flexibility. While self-association
is not necessarily a prerequisite for activity, the active sites of
perhaps one-sixth of all oligomeric enzymes are located at highly
stabilized interfaces between two peptide chains.

Such is the case with thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent
enzymes., While this group of enzymes has evolved
to catalyze a wide range
of chemical reactions, X-ray structures
have shown that overwhelmingly they have developed only one way to
bind the ThDP cofactor, namely at the interface between two monomers.
This creates two active sites per homodimer with each monomer contributing
either a pyrimidine binding (PYR) domain or a diphosphate binding
(PP) domain to a given active site (Figure ). At a minimum, therefore, any ThDP-dependent enzyme must form a
dimer., Curiously, until recently, all the ThDP-dependent
enzymes whose sole in vivo function is to catalyze
a decarboxylation reaction were found to be homotetramers, albeit
more accurately described as dimers of active dimers.− The branched-chain 2-keto acid decarboxylase from Lactococcus
lactis (KdcA, EC 4.1.1.72) was the first to deviate from
this trend when its X-ray structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2VBG] showed to it be
dimeric. Intriguingly, although the archetypal
ThDP-dependent decarboxylase, pyruvate decarboxylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScPDC, EC 4.1.1.1),
is a tetramer in the crystal lattice, analytical ultracentrifugation
(AUC) experiments showed it to be a dimer at low solution concentrations. Further, using urea as a denaturant, it was
possible to shift the dimer–tetramer equilibrium in favor of
the dimer and to demonstrate that the dimer was catalytically active.,

with both the phosphate-binding domain of monomer A (green) and the

using data from PDB entry 1BFD.

Benzoylformate decarboxylase
(BFDC, EC 4.1.1.7) is another ThDP-dependent
decarboxylase that has been shown to be a homotetramer. First identified as part of the mandelate pathway
of Pseudomonas putida, BFDC catalyzes the nonoxidative decarboxylation of benzoylformate
to yield benzaldehyde and carbon dioxide. Not surprisingly, given the similarity of their reactions, there
is considerable structural homology between BFDC and PDC, including
the conservation of several catalytic residues. As part of a project
examining the evolution of ThDP-dependent enzymes, we have been attempting
to interconvert the two enzymes, but with limited success., Unlike ScPDC, it has never been determined whether
BFDC is active as a dimer, nor has it been shown what advantage, if
any, the tetramer provides to BFDC. Here, we report the use of site-directed
mutagenesis coupled with analytical centrifugation and X-ray crystallography
to answer two questions. (i) Can BFDC be converted into a dimer? (ii)
Is the tetramer required for enzymatic activity?

Materials and Methods
Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies. Recombinant
alcohol dehydrogenase from Equus caballus (HLADH)
was obtained as described previously. Reduced β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), isopropyl
β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and benzoylformate
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. A gel filtration calibration kit
(high molecular mass) and HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 High Resolution
column were purchased from GE Healthcare. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid (NTA) resin was purchased from Qiagen. Pfu DNA
polymerase was purchased from Stratagene. Buffers and other assay
reagents were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific
and were of the highest grade commercially available. Sequencing was
conducted by the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core Facility.

Analysis
of Dimer and Tetramer Interfaces
The X-ray
structure of wt BFDC at 1.60 Å resolution (PDB
entry 1BFD)
was used as the model for analysis of the interfaces. The SPPIDER
server (http://sppider.cchmc.org) was used to calculate
the total surface area and the interface surface area and to verify
that residues selected for mutagenesis were not involved in the formation
of the active dimer. The PDB visualization program PyMOL (Schrödinger,
LLC) was used to identify targets for mutagenesis and for the preparation
of figures.

Plasmids
Mutagenesis was performed
on BFDC expression
vector pET24dBFDC-His., Primers (Table 1 of the ) were designed, and site-directed
mutagenesis was performed according to the QuikChange mutagenesis
protocol (Agilent) utilizing Pfu DNA polymerase.
DpnI was used to digest parental DNA prior to its transformation into
chemically competent TOP10 cells. Each plasmid used for protein expression
had the complete mdlC gene sequenced to ensure that
only the desired mutations were present.

Protein Expression and
Purification
Expression of wt BFDC and its
variants was conducted in Escherichia
coli strain BL21(DE3). Induction of the recombinant protein
was initiated with 1 mM IPTG. Following induction, the cultures were
grown at room temperature overnight (18–20 h). Enzymes were
purified as described previously. The
protein was exchanged into BFDC storage buffer [100 mM KHPO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.5 mM ThDP (pH 6.0), and 10% (v/v) glycerol]
and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore).
Purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, and the protein concentration was determined
from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient
of 62220, calculated from the sequence of wt BFDC
with the ExPASy ProtParam tool. Enzymes
were stored at −80 °C until they were required.

Steady-State
Kinetic Analysis of Wild-Type and Variant BFDC
The coupled
activity assay of the purified enzymes was performed
as described previously. The assay mixture
contained bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1 mg/mL), NADH, and HLADH in
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and varying concentrations
of benzoylformate in a final volume of 1 mL. Reactions were conducted
at 30 °C and were initiated by the addition of the enzyme. Assays
were performed in triplicate. Steady-state kinetic parameters were
determined by fitting the initial rate data to the Michaelis–Menten
equation, using the enzyme kinetics module of SigmaPlot version 9.0.1
(Systat Software, Inc.).

For the equilibrium denaturation studies,
assays were conducted in denaturation buffer using the direct UV assay
of Hegeman. The decrease in benzoylformate
concentration was monitored at 334 nm.

Molecular Mass Predicted
by Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)
Size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) was performed using an AKTA
fast performance liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) equipped
with a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 High Resolution column (1.6 cm
× 94 cm). The column was equilibrated with running buffer [50
mM NaPO4 and 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5)] prior to calibration.
Blue Dextran was used to determine the void volume of the column.
A standard curve was obtained using a high-molecular mass gel filtration
calibration kit (GE Healthcare). Protein standards were loaded according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. BFDC variants were loaded onto
the column via injection into a 2 mL loop at concentrations ranging
from 0.1 to 1 mg/mL in a total volume of 400 μL. Kav values were calculated and used to predict the molecular
mass and oligomerization state of the BFDC variants

SEC-MALS Analysis
Size-exclusion chromatography multiangle
light scattering (SEC-MALS) was performed on wt BFDC
and the R141E/A306F and R141E/Y288A/A306F variants. Three concentrations,
3.1, 1.5, and 0.75 mg/mL, were used for the mutant BFDC proteins.
For the wt enzyme, concentrations of 2.0, 1.0, and
0.75 mg/mL were used. A Superdex 200 column coupled to the three-angle
miniDawn TREOS and Optilab-Trex instrument (Wyatt Technologies) was
used for collection of the light scattering and refractive index data.
The system is coupled to an Agilent 1100 high-performance liquid chromatography
system at a flow rate of 0.45 mL/min with an in-line spectrophotometer.
Astra (version 6.0.3) was used to analyze the collected data.

Analytical
Ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity
experiments were conducted on Beckman-Coulter XLA and XLI analytical
ultracentrifuges. wt BFDC and the R141E/A306F and
R141E/Y288A/A306F variants were dialyzed extensively against a buffer
containing 100 mM NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, and 35 μM ThDP. The sample concentrations ranged from
0.25 to 1.0 mg/mL. The samples were then centrifuged at 42000 rpm
using two-sector 1.2 cm path-length carbon-filled Epon centerpieces.
The experiments were conducted on an An-50 Ti rotor at 20 °C.
The density and relative viscosity of the buffers were calculated
with SEDNTERP version 1.09 (http://www.jphilo.mailway.com/download.htm#SEDNTERP) to be 1.01949 g mL–1 and 0.01069 P, respectively.
On the basis of its sequence, the partial specific volume (vbar) of
the protein was calculated with SEDNTERP to be 0.7340 mL g–1. The samples were monitored at 280 nm with a 4 min delay and 150
scans. The c(s) distributions were
analyzed using SEDFIT version 14.3e. Molecular
masses were calculated from the c(s) data using a shape assumption.

Urea Unfolding Monitored
by Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
and Fluorescence Spectrophotometry
wt BFDC
and the R141E/A306F variant (0.15 mg/mL) were incubated overnight
at 4 °C with varying urea concentrations in 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 6.0). Far-UV CD experiments were conducted on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter.
Unfolding was monitored by changes in ellipticity at 222 nm in a cell
with a path length of 0.1 cm at 20 °C. Spectra were averaged
over five scans, and the scan speed was set at 20 nm/min with a response
time of 1 s and a slit width of 1 nm.

Fluorescence emission
spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer.
The intrinsic fluorescence of wt BFDC and the R141E/A306F
variant, both at 0.15 mg/mL in varying concentrations of urea in 50
mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) at 20 °C, was recorded from 295
to 450 nm using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. The bandpass for
excitation and emission was set at 5 nm with a scanning rate of 200
nm/min.

Crystallization of the R141E and A306F Variants
Crystals
of BFDC R141E and BFDC A306F variants were grown by the hanging drop
diffusion method under the same conditions used for the crystallization
of wt BFDC. Storage
buffer was exchanged for crystallization buffer [0.1 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM ThDP, and 25 mM NaHEPES (pH 7.0)]. The well solution consisted
of 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5), 0.15 M CaCl2, and 22% PEG400 (v/v).
Equal volumes of protein (10 mg/mL) and well solution were pipetted
onto a silanized glass slide and mixed. A heavy precipitate immediately
formed from this mixture, and single crystals emerged from the precipitate
within days. Crystals were transferred to fresh crystallization buffer
containing 36% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant and mounted on Hampton
CryoLoops immediately prior to being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

X-ray Data Collection
Diffraction data were obtained
at 100 K on the 23-ID-D and 23-ID-B beamlines administered by GM/CA-CAT
at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne,
IL). Data sets for the R141E and A306F variants were scaled to the I222 space group. Data reduction and processing
of data sets were achieved using the HKL2000 software package and
the CCP4 suite of programs. Molecular
replacement was performed using the search model wt BFDC (PDB entry 1BFD) with metals and waters removed. The asymmetric unit for each variant
contained a single monomer.

Structure Solutions and Refinements
PHENIX was used
for model refinement. After each round
of refinement, the electron density was manually inspected and models
were built using Coot. Refinement continued
until Rfree and the crystallographic R factor could no longer be improved. The validity of the
model was checked using the MolProbity server. All images were generated using PyMOL (Schrödinger,
LLC).

Results
Comparison of the Quaternary Structures of
KdcA, ScPDC, and BFDC
It is clear from their
respective X-ray structures
that KdcA is a homodimer and that BFDC is a homotetramer (Figure ). Although ScPDC was initially reported to be a
homotetramer, structural analysis suggests
that its tetrameric form may arise simply by crystal packing. To examine this possibility, we turned to the
Solvent accessibility-based Protein-Protein Interface iDEntification
and Recognition (SPPIDER) server that can be used to predict the total
surface area of interfaces from a PDB file. Analyses were conducted on three ThDP-dependent decarboxylases,
KdcA (PDB entry 2VBF), ScPDC (PDB entry 1PYD), and BFDC (PDB entry 1BFD). In each case,
the interface forming the active site, defined as the A–B interface
(Figure ), was clearly identified (Table ). There was no evidence of any dimer–dimer
interface in the KdcA structure, supporting the crystallographic finding
of a homodimer. Interestingly, no evidence was found for any dimer–dimer
interface when the ScPDC structure was used as the
search model. This reinforces the suggestion that the tetramer observed
in the crystal lattice of ScPDC might be an artifact
of protein crowding at higher enzyme concentrations. Conversely, analysis
of the X-ray structure of BFDC with SPPIDER indicates a robust dimer–dimer
interface accounting for almost 10% of the total surface are of the
enzyme (Table ).

Analysis of the Dimer–Dimer
Interfaces of BFDC
SPPIDER analysis of the quaternary structure
of BFDC shows that each
chain has significant interactions with every other chain in the tetramer
(Table ). The interface that forms the active
dimer, the A–B interface, was calculated to have the largest
total area of contact (3540 Å2), ∼17% of the
solvent accessible surface area of the monomer. It seems logical that
disruption of the A–B interface would result in a loss of enzyme
activity; therefore, our attempts to convert BFDC into a dimer were
focused on disrupting the A–C and A–D interfaces (Figure ).

The A/D interface was the next largest,
with a total surface area of ∼1600 Å2 or about
8% of the total monomer A surface area. Here Tyr288 and Ala306 were
identified as possible candidates for mutagenesis. Tyr288 of monomer
A has 12 points of contact within 5 Å of monomer D (Figure ), and it was reasoned that elimination of most
of these interactions by removal of the phenyl ring should result
in a less stable A/D interface. Additionally, the methyl side chain
of Ala306 on monomer A is located in a shallow hydrophobic cleft of
monomer D (Figure ), and it was thought that
replacement by a bulkier residue such as phenylalanine would not be
tolerated, and may help disrupt the interface.

interface. (A) Tyr288 of monomer
A is found to have 12 points of contact (≤5 Å) with monomer
D. (B) Ala306 of monomer A is located in a shallow hydrophobic cleft
of monomer D.

At ∼500 Å2, the A–C interface accounts
for ∼2.5% of the total surface area of monomer A and is mostly
comprised of residues in charge–charge interactions. The side
chains of Glu107 and Asp114 of monomer A, for example, form salt bridges
with Arg141 and Arg120, respectively, of monomer C (Figure ). Because of the 2-fold symmetry, Arg120 and Arg141
of monomer A also interact with Asp114 and Glu107 of monomer C. These
four positions were selected as targets for mutagenesis, specifically
to introduce like-charge repulsions in an attempt to destabilize the
dimer–dimer interface. A summary of the various interactions,
and the rationale for the mutagenesis experiments can be found in
Table S2 of the .

Kinetic and SEC Analysis
of A–C and A–D Single-Mutation
Variants
All variants expressed as soluble protein. Using
the typical assay conditions described in , Km and kcat values of the A–D variants were very similar
to those of wt BFDC (Table ). The A–C variants also exhibited no change in their Km values, but compared to that of wt BFDC, there was a modest 2–4-fold decrease in their kcat values. All variants eluted from the SEC
column at a volume indicative of a tetramer (Table ). On the basis of these results, it appeared that the single
mutations did not noticeably alter the dimer–tetramer equilibrium
or greatly affect the overall catalytic activity of the enzyme.

Generation and Analysis
of the R141E/Y288A/A306F Variant
The inability of a single
mutation to produce a dimeric BFDC prompted
a reanalysis of the A–D and A–C interfaces. The A–D
interface accounts for nearly 10% of the total surface area; therefore,
it was not surprising that more than one unfavorable interaction would
be required to disrupt it. It was noted that the hydrophobic pocket
that accommodates Ala306 comprised Met145, Met148, and the hydrophobic
region of the Arg141 side chain. It was reasoned that replacement
of Arg141 with a glutamic acid would have a dual effect in that it
would set up an unfavorable interaction with Glu107 and reduce the
hydrophobicity of the Ala306 binding pocket. To maximize the destabilizing
interactions, the R141E/Y288A/A306F variant was constructed. The triple
mutant expressed well and was purified as a soluble protein. When
subjected to SEC chromatography at 1 mg/mL, it eluted at a volume
similar to that of wt BFDC but, at ≤0.5 mg/mL,
it eluted at a larger volume, suggestive of a change in oligomerization
state (Table ). Unfortunately, it also was
inactive in the assay.

Verification of the Quaternary Structure
of wt BFDC and the R141E/Y288A/A306F Variant
To validate the
SEC observations and to confirm that the oligomerization state of
the triple mutant was indeed concentration-dependent, we turned to
a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation and SEC-MALS. Sedimentation
velocity experiments were performed, and the sedimentation coefficients
(S) for wt BFDC were determined
at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/mL (Figure S1 of the ). At each concentration,
an S value of 8.4 was calculated from a c(s) distribution (Table S3 of the ). The calculated molecular mass from
these experiments was 241 ± 22 kDa, which agrees with the theoretical
molecular mass of ∼229 kDa for the BFDC tetramer. Additional
SEC-MALS analysis provided a molecular mass of 235.1 ± 16.5 kDa,
also corresponding to a tetrameric species (Table S4 of the ). Similar experiments
were performed on the triple mutant, and by contrast, the S value determined at the same concentrations was found
to be 7.9 (Figure S1 of the ). The SEC-MALS analysis for the R141E/Y288A/A306F variant showed
a pronounced concentration-dependent shift in both molecular mass
and retention time (Figure S2 and Table S4 of the ). All these changes pointed to a shift
in the dimer–tetramer equilibrium.

Analysis of the R141E/Y288A/A306F
Permutation Variants
Having seemingly changed the dimer–tetramer
equilibrium, we
thought it was important to determine which combination of mutations
was crucial in bringing about the change. Accordingly, the three permutations
of the R141E/Y288A/A306F mutant were constructed. Once again, the
variants were expressed as soluble proteins and could be assayed under
standard conditions. Like the single mutants, R141E/Y288A, R141E/A306F,
and Y288A/A306F variants all had Km values
similar to that of wt BFDC. Conversely, they all
showed considerable decreases in kcat values,
with the greatest decrease (∼3500-fold) seen for Y288A/A306F
(Table ). Each of the variants was subjected
to SEC chromatography at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg/mL.
While R141E/Y288A and Y288A/A306F eluted at volumes indicative of
a tetramer regardless of concentration, the R141E/A306F variant exhibited
concentration-dependent changes similar to those shown previously
by the R141E/Y288A/A306F variant. In some ways, this was a surprising
result as the kcat value for R141E/A306F
was 0.8 s–1, admittedly a ∼450-fold decrease
over that of wt BFDC but still much higher than that
of the Y288A/A306F variant that remained a tetramer. The Y288A and
A306F single variants retained nearly wild-type activity (Table ), so it is not unreasonable to assume that the
double mutant exhibiting the greatest decrease in activity would be
the one most likely to show alterations in its oligomerization state.
Clearly, that is not the case here, and the reasons for the reduced
activity in this variant will become the focus of a future investigation.

To explore this further, the R141E/A306F variant was analyzed,
in turn, by analytical centrifugation (Figure S1 of the ) and SEC-MALS (Figure
S2 of the ). The
calculated S value for the double mutant was 7.3,
significantly lower than that of wt BFDC. This number
was obtained at all protein concentrations (Table S3 of the ). It was also apparent
from the SEC-MALS data that the R141E/A306F variant showed concentration-dependent
changes in retention time, which are reflected in its molecular mass
(Table S4 of the ).

Figure  provides a ready comparison
of
the AUC and SEC-MALS data for wt BFDC and the two
variants, R141E/A306F and R141E/Y288A/A306F. The continuous size distribution
analysis data, obtained at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL (8.6
μM), highlight the trend toward lower S values,
indicative of a smaller species. In addition, at 0.75 mg/mL, both
variants have a clear increase in retention time over that of wt BFDC (Figure B), confirming a
movement toward dimer formation.

(A) Distribution of normalized c(s) values for wt BFDC
and the R141E/A306F and R141E/Y288A/A306F
variants. In each case, the protein concentration was 0.5 mg/mL (8.6
μM). At that concentration, the S values are
8.4, 7.9, and 7.3 for the wt, triple mutant, and
double mutant, respectively. (B) SEC-MALS analysis of wt BFDC and the two variants (0.75 mg/mL) shows the change in the dimer–tetramer
equilibrium for the latter.

Equilibrium Denaturation Measurements
The urea-mediated
unfolding of wt BFDC and the R141E/A306F variant
was followed by both intrinsic fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. To
highlight any differences, the unfolding experiments were conducted
at an enzyme concentration of 0.15 mg/mL. At this concentration, the wt enzyme is tetrameric whereas the R141E/A306F variant
is expected to be primarily dimeric. As shown in Figure A, when monitored using the intrinsic fluorescence signal
at 327 nm, the unfolding of wt BFDC appears to have
three transitions. Initially, between 0 and 0.5 M urea, there is a
small increase in fluorescence. Another small transition is observed
on going from 0.5 to 2 M urea, while the largest transition takes
place between 2 and 6 M urea. Potentially, the first corresponds to
the dissociation of tetramers to dimers; the second is that of the
dimers to monomers, and the third results from the unfolding of the
monomers. Such a pattern was also observed for ScPDC. By contrast, the unfolding of the
R141E/A306F variant showed only two transitions (Figure A), most likely due to the initial unfolding of the dimer
followed by unfolding of the monomer.

and enzymatic activity (○) for wt BFDC. All
changes were monitored at 20 °C. The results shown are the average
of at least two independent measurements.

Similar results were observed for wt BFDC
when
unfolding was monitored by far UV-CD (Figure B). Further, the urea-induced inactivation of wt BFDC is complete by 3.5 M urea (Figure B),
and it is evident that some degree of inactivation of the wt enzyme has occurred even at urea concentrations as low
as 0.25 M. This decrease in the activity of wt BFDC
is presumably caused by the dissociation of the tetramer. This result
is in stark contrast to that found in the same experiment conducted
with ScPDC. In that case, the enzyme was fully active
at 1 M urea, and dimers and tetramers were equally active. The unfolding of the R141E/A306F variant, monitored
by CD, followed a pattern almost identical to that observed in the
fluorescence experiments (Figure S3 of the ). Unfortunately, because of low levels of activity,
it was not possible to follow the inactivation of the R141E/A306F
variant. Nonetheless, the experiments did demonstrate clearly that
there were distinct differences in the urea-mediated denaturation
of wt BFDC and the R141E/A306F variant, providing
additional evidence that the equilibrium has shifted toward dimer
formation in the latter.

X-ray Structures of the R141E and A306F Variants
Attempts
to crystallize the double and triple variants were unsuccessful. However,
the X-ray structures of the R141E (PDB entry 4MPR) and A306F (PDB
entry 4MQ5)
variants were determined to resolutions of 1.40 and 1.50 Å, respectively
(Table ). Both exhibited the same fold as
the wt enzyme; their space group and cell dimensions
were also identical, and as previously observed with other BFDC structures,
residues 461–468 had the highest B factors
of any region of the protein., The active sites were
also unchanged, and given that the kinetic parameters for these variants
were similar to those of wt BFDC (Table ), this result was not entirely unexpected. However,
the mutations did bring about some unanticipated structural changes
that are worthy of comment.

It was predicted that mutating Arg141 to a glutamate would result
in a variant that not only would be unable to form a salt bridge with
Glu107 but also would create like-charge repulsion between Glu107
and Glu141. Surprisingly, the crystal structure of the R141E variant
revealed the carboxylate group of Glu141 is complexed to a Na+ ion, as well as the indole moiety of Trp125 (Figure ). Four water molecules were also coordinated to
the sodium ion, as was the carbonyl of Gly105. One of these waters
was located within 3 Å of the carboxylate of Glu107. It seems
that these unexpected interactions were sufficient to alleviate the
predicted charge–charge repulsion that was expected to tilt
the equilibrium toward the dimeric state.

Potential Glu141–Glu107
interaction avoided in the R141E
variant. Instead, Glu141 is found coordinated to Trp125 and an additional
Na+ ion. Blue dashes indicate distances of ≤3 Å.

Perhaps the most surprising observation
was that the A306F substitution
resulted in the displacement of the side chain of Arg141. This meant
that the guanidinium group of arginine forms an intramonomer salt
bridge with the side chain of Glu134 rather than the intermonomer
interaction with Glu107 (Figure ). The net
result was that the additional bulk of the new phenylalanine residue
was readily accommodated.

Discussion
In his structure-based analysis of the domain
relationships inherent
to the ThDP-dependent enzymes, Duggleby proposed that the original enzyme was a protein that contained binding
sites for both ends of the ThDP molecule. Dimerization provided an
advance by which the intrinsic activity of the cofactor was enhanced.
Duplication of the gene for the primitive decarboxylase resulted in
an α2β2 heterotetramer, likely a
still more efficient enzyme. Subsequently, gene fusion led to the
combination of the PP and PYR domains, giving rise to, effectively,
an (αβ)2 protein that can be seen to this day
in phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase., The more modern
ThDP-dependent decarboxylases at some point acquired a third domain,
the TH3 domain, which fused between the PYR and PP domains. A broadly similar evolutionary pattern has also
been postulated on the basis of sequence analysis, with the added
suggestion that recruitment of the TH3 domain was accompanied by tetramer
formation.

What was not considered
in any of these discussions is whether
tetramer formation is essential or, if not, what advantage accrues
due to tetramer formation. Allosteric regulation may have been a possible
candidate, particularly as KdcA is a dimer and exhibits Michaelis–Menten
kinetics whereas ScPDC is subject to allosteric activation
by its substrate. However, this explanation
is made less likely by the X-ray structures of ScPDC in its unliganded and substrate-activated
forms, which both show the enzyme to
be tetrameric. Further, studies by Killenberg-Jabs et al., have found that ScPDC exists as an equilibrium
mixture of dimers and tetramers under physiological conditions, and
that there was no difference in the steady-state activity between
the two states. Altogether, it would appear that the ability to form
a tetramer is not a prerequisite for allosteric activation.

In contrast to ScPDC, BFDC is tetrameric and obeys
Michaelis–Menten kinetics. In many ways, it is more comparable
to the PDC from Zymomonas mobiliz (ZmPDC), which has similar properties. The
similarity was confirmed by SPPIDER analysis, which showed that an
individual monomer in both BFDC and ZmPDC makes significant
contact with the other three monomers in the tetramer (Table ). This is quite different from the cases of KdcA
and ScPDC, which show contacts only between the two
monomers comprising the catalytic dimer.

Attempts to alter the
dimer–tetramer equilibrium of BFDC
by disrupting the noncatalytic monomer–monomer interfaces with
point mutations were unsuccessful. Initially, it took the introduction
of three mutations before any change was observed by SEC. This shift
in equilibrium was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation. The
R141E/Y288A/A306F variant showed no activity in the standard assay
or in those containing 500 μg/mL enzyme. Subsequently, it was
shown that two mutations, R141E and A306F, were sufficient to alter
the dimer–tetramer equilibrium. At an assay concentration of
40 μg/mL, this variant showed a considerable (∼450-fold)
reduction in its kcat from that of wt BFDC, but it was impossible to say whether this was a
reflection of the presence of tetramer in solution or the dimer indeed
retained some activity. To investigate the latter possibility, we
turned to equilibrium denaturation experiments.

It has been
shown that, in a 0.5 M urea solution, ScPDC forms
dimers, and those dimers have the same specific activity
as the tetramers. Here we found that
BFDC has a urea unfolding curve similar to that of ScPDC, regardless of whether unfolding was measured by intrinsic fluorescence
or by CD. However, unlike ScPDC, BFDC showed a rapid
loss of activity, even at urea concentrations as low as 0.25 M. Taken
together, our data suggest that, to be catalytically active, it is
necessary for BFDC to be a tetramer.

Although that may be a
reasonable conclusion, it is still not clear
why the tetramer is necessary. Although all the single variants were
very active, indicating that they were still tetrameric, the X-ray
structures of both R141E and A306F provided some clues, with the most
insightful piece of information coming from the crystal structure
of the A306F variant. It was predicted that replacing Ala306 with
phenylalanine would result in a steric clash that would help destabilize
the tetramer. Surprisingly, the A306F structure revealed a rearrangement
of the shallow pocket, by which the additional steric bulk of the
phenylalanine was accommodated (Figure ).
This was due to the displacement of the side chain of Arg141 and Met145,
which resulted in a larger binding pocket. The new rotamer of Arg141
saw the loss of the intermonomer interaction with Glu107 and the formation
of a new intramonomer bond with Glu134 (Figure ). Extrapolating to the R141E/A306F variant, we could assume that
rather than Glu141 forming a salt bridge with Glu134, the interaction
would be unfavorable. Potentially, this could cause Glu141 to spring
back into its “original” position, making the accommodation
of Phe306 more difficult. In the R141E structure, the enzyme used
an additional sodium ion to help adapt to the potential Glu107–Glu141
contact (Figure ). This may not be feasible
in the R141E/A306F variant. The net result would be that the A–C
and A–D interfaces are both destabilized, pushing the equilibrium
toward the dimer as suggested by the SEC and equilibrium denaturation
experiments.

Again, this is speculation, and it does not provide
any insight
into the apparent necessity for BFDC to be tetrameric to be catalytically
active. Still, it is possible to take the speculation a little further
by looking more closely at structural differences among BFDC, KdcA,
and PDC. The three all belong to the decarboxylase-like (DC) structural
clade of ThDP-dependent enzymes. The
vast majority of enzymes of the DC clade possess an inner active site
loop that contains residues known to be critical to their catalytic
mechanism. For example, the loops of ScPDC, 3-indole-pyruvate
decarboxylase, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase, and KdcA all include
two adjoining histidine residues sometimes termed the HH motif. Mutagenesis of either histidine results in a
decrease in catalytic activity of orders of magnitude.− Conversely, although the active site of BFDC also contains two catalytically
important histidine residues, these are not located on the inner loop.
Instead, the loop of BFDC houses two contiguous leucine residues,
Leu109 and Leu110. Alignment of the sequences of enzymes annotated
as BFDCs in the thiamin enzyme engineering database (TEED) shows that
Leu110 is completely conserved, and that leucine, or another hydrophobic
residue, is invariably found at position 109.

Examination of the X-ray structure of BFDC in complex with
benzoyl
phosphonic acid methyl ester (MBP), an analogue of benzoylformate,
shows that Leu109 lines the phenyl-binding pocket of BFDC and that
Leu110 has five points of contact within 5 Å of the glyoxylate
analogue portion of MBP (Figure ). From this
structure, it appears that Leu110 acts as a clamp to lock the glyoxylate
moiety into the perpendicular arrangement of the carboxylate group
to the thiazolium–C2α bond. This geometry is thought
to promote decarboxylation by allowing the maximal overlap of the
π electrons of the thiazolium ring and the p orbital of the
scissile bond., Intriguingly, the active site
loop of BFDC is bookended by Glu107 and Asp114, which, of course,
interact with Arg141 and Arg120, respectively, in the A–C interface
(Figure ). It is not unreasonable to imagine
that these two salt bridges may be responsible for maintaining the
correct positioning of Leu109 and Leu110 within the active site of
BFDC, thereby contributing to both the overall hydrophobicity of the
active site and the correct position of the substrate within it.

Leu109
and Leu110 are positioned by the interaction of Arg141 and
Arg120 of monomer A with Glu107 and Asp114 of monomer C, respectively.
Blue dashes indicate distances of ∼3 Å. Red dashes indicate
distances of ≤5 Å.

To assess the importance of the two leucine residues, both
Leu109
and Leu110 were replaced, in turn, with alanine. Both variants showed
decreases in kcat of 2 orders of magnitude,
while L110A also exhibited a 9-fold increase in Km (Table ). Overall, the changes
were broadly in line with those observed with the R141E/A306F variant.
It would appear that the decrease in activity observed with the latter
may be due to movement in the inner loop resulting in the misalignment
of Leu109 and Leu110 within the active site. To test this assumption,
the E107R/D114R double variant was generated to completely disrupt
the A–C interface, simultaneously preventing the correct positioning
of both Leu109 and Leu110. While the individual substitutions produced
only a modest effect on catalysis, the catalytic efficiency of the
E107R/D114R variant was ∼600-fold lower than that of wt BFDC (Table ). It is notable
that the kcat and Km values for this variant were very similar to those of R141E/A306F,
yet SEC data suggested that the E107R/D114R variant remained a tetramer.
On that basis, it may be that the integrity of the dimer interface,
rather than the tetrameric structure per se, is of paramount importance.

Conclusion
We have demonstrated that, in some cases, only two point mutations
are required to alter the dimer–tetramer equilibrium of BFDC.
In addition, it is apparent that the shift in equilibrium toward dimer
formation is accompanied by a loss of catalytic activity. Finally,
we provide evidence that suggests the tetrameric structure of BFDC
has evolved as a means of positioning and stabilizing the active site
loop residues, Leu109 and Leu110.
