This
paper describes the role of α-subunit VISIT-DG sequence
residue αThr-349 in the catalytic sites of Escherichia
coli F1Fo ATP synthase. X-ray structures
show the highly conserved αThr-349 in the proximity (2.68 Å)
of the conserved phosphate binding residue βR182 in the phosphate
binding subdomain. αT349A, -D, -Q, and -R mutations caused 90–100-fold
losses of oxidative phosphorylation and reduced ATPase activity of
F1Fo in membranes. Double mutation αT349R/βR182A
was able to partially compensate for the absence of known phosphate
binding residue βR182. Azide, fluoroaluminate, and fluoroscandium
caused insignificant inhibition of αT349A, -D, and -Q mutants,
slight inhibition of the αT349R mutant, partial inhibition of
the αT349R/βR182A double mutant, and complete inhibition
of the wild type. Whereas NBD-Cl (7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)
inhibited wild-type ATPase and its αT349A, -D, -R, and -Q mutants
essentially completely, βR182A ATPase and double mutant αT349A/βR182A
were inhibited partially. Inhibition characteristics supported the
conclusion that NBD-Cl reacts in βE (empty) catalytic sites,
as shown previously by X-ray structure analysis. Phosphate protected
against NBD-Cl inhibition in the wild type, αT349R, and double
mutant αT349R/βR182A but not in αT349A, αT349D,
or αT349Q. The results demonstrate that αThr-349 is a
supplementary residue involved in phosphate binding and transition
state stabilization in ATP synthase catalytic sites through its interaction
with βR182.

In a 75 year
life span, a typical
70 kg human generates approximately 2.0 million kg of ATP. The cell’s
energy currency is generated by converting food into useable energy
by oxidation. F1Fo ATP synthase is responsible
for the fundamental means of cell energy production in animals, plants,
and almost all microorganisms, which occurs by oxidation or photophosphorylation
in membranes of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. ATP synthase
is one of the smallest biological nanomotors and is structurally similar
in all species.1−4 In its simplest form, as in Escherichia coli, it
contains eight different subunits distributed in the water-soluble
F1 sector (subunits α3β3γδε) and the membrane-associated Fo sector
(subunits ab2c10). The total molecular size
is ∼530 kDa.4 In chloroplasts, there
are two isoforms of subunit b. In mitochondria, there are seven to
nine additional subunits, depending on the source, but in total, they
contribute only a small fraction of additional mass and may have regulatory
roles.5−7

The membrane-bound F1Fo ATP synthase enzyme
is highly conserved and structurally identical among different species.
X-ray structures of bovine enzyme8 established
the presence of three catalytic sites at α-subunit−β-subunit
interfaces of the α3β3 hexamer.
ATP hydrolysis and synthesis occur in the F1 sector, whereas
proton transport occurs through the membrane-embedded Fo.8,9 ATP synthesis is a result of proton gradient-driven
clockwise rotation of γ (as viewed from the outer membrane),
while ATP hydrolysis results in anticlockwise rotation of the γ-subunit.
Detailed reviews of ATP synthase structure and function may be found
in refs (10−18).

A precise knowledge of Pi (inorganic phosphate)
binding
is not only essential for following the reaction mechanism of ATP
synthesis and hydrolysis but also equally important for understanding
the relationship between catalytic mechanism and mechanical rotation
in this biological nanomotor. For this reason, we have focused our
efforts on determining the role of conserved residues in and around
catalytic site Pi binding subdomain.19 Knowledge of Pi binding residues and residues
surrounding the Pi binding subdomain is imperative for
(i) the molecular modulation of the catalytic site(s) for the improved
catalytic and motor function of this enzyme, (ii) an explanation of
how ATP synthase binds ADP and Pi within its catalytic
sites in the face of a relatively high ATP/ADP concentration ratio,
and (iii) understanding the relationship between Pi binding
and subunit rotation.20−22 Many earlier attempts to measure Pi binding
in purified E. coli F1 failed to detect
appreciable Pi binding at physiological Pi concentrations,21,23,24 but modification of the assay
devised by Perez et al.25 provides a useful
measure of Pi binding. In this assay, protection is afforded
by Pi against inhibition of ATPase activity induced by
covalent reaction with 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD-Cl).
X-ray crystallography showed that the covalent interaction of NBD-Cl
specifically with β297 occurs in the βE catalytic site26 (see Figure 1A); thus,
protection afforded by Pi indicates that binding of Pi occurs at the βE catalytic site. Modification of the
assay described above for E. coli, purified F1 or F1Fo membranes, previously allowed
us to investigate the relationship between Pi binding and
catalysis for eight residues, namely, βArg-246, βAsn-243,
αArg-376, βLys-155, βArg-182, αPhe-291, αSer-347,
and αGly-351.a Although all these residues
are situated in the proximity of the phosphate analogues AlF3 or SO42– in X-ray structures of catalytic
sites,27,28 we found that four residues, namely, βArg-246,
αArg-376, βLys-155, and βArg-182, grouped in a triangular
fashion, are directly involved in Pi binding while the
fifth residue, αSer-347, is indirectly involved in Pi binding through its interaction with βArg-246 (see Figure 1B).19,29−35

Pi binding site. Rasmol was used to generate these structures.

The mechanism of condensation
of Pi with MgADP proposed
by Senior et al.9 was strengthened by the
X-ray crystallography structure of bovine ATP synthase of Menz et
al.28 showing the transition state analogue
MgADP·AlF4– trapped in catalytic
sites (Figure 1B). It is clear from the geometry
of this complex that the fluoroaluminate group occupies the position
of the ATP γ-phosphate in the predicted transition state. The
first transition state-like structure of F1 from rat liver
crystallized with the Pi analogue vanadate (Vi), reported by Pedersen’s group, demonstrated that ADP was
not essential, suggesting that the MgVi–F1 complex inhibited the catalytic activity to the same extent as that
observed for the MgADP–Vi–F1 complex.36 Neither purified F1 nor membrane-bound
F1Fo from E. coli is inhibited
by MgVi or MgADP–Vi.30 Consequently, we have relied on inhibition of ATPase activity
by fluoroaluminate (or fluoroscandium) to assess the potential to
stabilize a transition state complex.19,29−32,35

Cingolani and Duncan18 have resolved
the first E. coli F1 sector high-resolution
crystal structure in an autoinhibited conformation. This structure
divulges a wealth of information about the regulatory features of
bacterial and chloroplast ATP synthase. Moreover, the E. coli ATP synthase X-ray structure paves the way for the development of
new antimicrobial drugs. For E. coli, ATP synthase
is naturally a better candidate for antimicrobial drugs in comparison
to mitochondrial ATP synthase.4,18 Newly developed anti-tuberculosis
drug targeting bacterial ATP synthase corroborates this assertion.37 Because the E. coli high-resolution
structure4 does not contain sulfate, phosphate,
fluoroaluminate, or fluoroscandium, we have relied on the mitochondrial
ATP synthase structure that is very similar to that of E.
coli (∼70% homologous sequence) as this study deals
with the analogues described above.27,28,38

Fortunately, by mutagenic analysis along with
the NBD-Cl protection
assay, as well as ATPase inhibition by transition state analogues,
we can investigate the direct or indirect role of residues in Pi binding. In this work, we examine the role of the highly
conserved α-subunit VISIT-DG sequence residue αThr-349
in the process of Pi binding. Figure 1B shows the position of αThr-349 with respect to other known
Pi binding residues. The strategic position of αThr-349
in the Pi binding subdomain leads to the following basic
questions: Is αThr-349 involved in Pi binding directly
or indirectly? Do the αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q, and
αT349R mutations have any effect on transition state formation?
Also, can αT349R compensate for βArg-182, a known Pi binding residue?

Materials and Methods
Construction of Wild-Type
and Mutant Strains of E. coli
The strain
for wild-type E. coli was pBWU13.4/DK8.39 All the mutants were generated by the method
of Vandeyar et al.40 The M13mp18 template
containing the HindIII–XbaI fragment from pSN6 was used for
oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid pSN6 contains the βY331W
mutation from plasmid pSWM441 introduced
on a SacI–EagI fragment into pBWU13.4,39 which expresses all the ATP synthase genes. The following mutagenic
oligonucleotides were used: αT349A, GTAATCTCTATAGCCGATGGTCAGATC,
where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new SfcI restriction
site; αT349D, GTAATCTCAATTGACGATGGTCAGATC,
where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new MfeI restriction
site; αT349Q, GTAATCTCCATTCAGGATGGTCAGATC,
where the underlined base introduces new mutation αT349Q (ACC
→ CAG); αT349R, CGTAATCTCCATTCGCGATGGTCAGATC,
where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new NruI restriction
site; βR182A, GGCGTAGGTGAAGCTACTCGTGAGGG,
where the underlined bases introduce the mutation and a new AluI restriction
site. DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the presence of mutations
and the absence of undesired changes in sequence, and the mutations
were transferred to pSN6 on a Csp451 (an isoschizomer of BstBI) and
the PmlI fragment generating the new plasmids pZA20(αT349A/βY331W),
pZA21(αT349D/βY331W), pZA22(αT349Q/βY331W),
pZA23(αT349R/βY331W), and pZA24(βR182A/βY331W).
Double mutant pZA25 (αT349R/βR182A) was generated by combining
the pZA23 fragment on the pZA24 plasmid at the Csp451 and PmlI site.
Each plasmid was transformed into strain DK842 containing a deletion of ATP synthase genes for expression of the
mutant enzymes. It may be noted that all mutant strains contained
the βY331W mutation, which is valuable for measurement of nucleotide
binding parameters41 and does not affect
function significantly on its own. While the presence of the βY331W
mutation was not utilized in this work, the Trp mutation was included
for possible future use.

Preparation of E. coli Membranes,
Measurement
of Growth Yield in Limiting Glucose Medium, and Assay of ATPase Activity
of Membranes
E. coli membrane-bound F1Fo were prepared by the method of Senior et al.43 Notably in this procedure, F1Fo-bound membrane initial pellets are washed three times. The
first wash is conducted in buffer containing 50 mM TES (pH 7.0), 15%
glycerol, 40 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 5 mM p-aminobenzamidine.
The next two washes are performed in buffer containing 5 mM TES (pH
7.0), 15% glycerol, 40 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mM p-aminobenzamidine, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5 mM EDTA.
Before the experiments, membranes were washed twice more by resuspension
and ultracentrifugation in 50 mM TrisSO4 (pH 8.0) and 2.5
mM MgSO4. These extra washes are meant to reduce the null
mutant to truly zero activity. Therefore, the low activities with
the mutants must be coming from the mutants, not from any other contaminants.
The experiments are performed to make sure that growth yield in limiting
glucose was measured as described previously.44 Measurement of ATPase activity was performed in 1 mL of assay buffer
containing 10 mM NaATP, 4 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM TrisSO4 (pH 8.5) at 37 °C. Reactions were started by the addition
of membrane-bound F1Fo and stopped by addition
of 1 mL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to a final concentration of
3.3%. Release of Pi was measured as described in ref (45). Reaction times for the
wild-type F1Fo membrane (20–30 μg
of protein) were 5–10 min, while reaction times for F1Fo-bound mutant membranes (40–60 μg of protein)
were 30–50 min. All reactions were found to be linear with
time and protein concentration. The purity and integrity of membranes
were checked by SDS gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels as
described in ref (46) and immunoblotting with rabbit polyclonal anti-F1-α
and anti-F1-β antibodies as described in ref (47).

Inhibition of ATPase Activity
by NBD-Cl and Protection by MgADP
or Pi
A stock solution of NBD-Cl was prepared
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and protected from light. F1Fo-bound membranes (0.2–0.5 mg/mL) were reacted
with NBD-Cl for 60 min in the dark, at room temperature, in T8 [50
mM TrisSO4 (pH 8.0)] and 2.5 mM MgSO4. ATPase
activity was determined by adding 50 μL aliquots from the assay
described above to 1 mL of ATPase assay buffer. For protection from
NBD-Cl inhibition by ADP or Pi, membranes were preincubated
for 60 min with a protecting agent at room temperature before the
addition of NBD-Cl. MgSO4 and ADP or Pi were
present at equimolar concentrations in the reaction assay. Control
samples containing the ligand without added NBD-Cl were included.
Neither MgADP (up to 10 mM) nor Pi (up to 50 mM) had any
inhibitory effect alone.

Reversal of NBD-Cl-Inhibited ATPase Activity
by DTT
To determine the DTT-induced reversal of NBD-Cl inhibition,
F1Fo-bound membranes were first reacted with
NBD-Cl
(150 μM) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, and then DTT
(final concentration of 4 mM) was added and incubation continued for
1 h at room temperature before the ATPase assay. Control samples without
NBD-Cl and/or DTT were incubated for the same amounts of time.

Inhibition
of ATPase Activity by Azide, Fluoroaluminate, or
Fluoroscandium
For measurement of azide inhibition, membrane-bound
F1Fo was preincubated with varied concentrations
of sodium azide for 30 min. Then 1 mL of ATPase assay buffer was added
to measure the activity. Measurements of fluoroaluminate or fluoroscandium
inhibition were performed by incubating membrane-bound F1Fo for 60 min at room temperature in 50 mM TrisSO4, 2.5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM NaADP, and 10 mM NaF at a
protein concentration of 0.2–0.5 mg/mL in the presence of varied
concentrations of AlCl3 or ScCl3 (see Results); 50 μL aliquots were then added to
1 mL of ATPase assay buffer, and activity was measured as described
above. It was confirmed in control experiments that no inhibition
was seen if MgSO4, NaADP, or NaF was omitted.

Inhibition
of ATPase Activity by Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD)
The
method of Weber et al.48 was used
to covalently modify the wild-type and mutant F1Fo membrane by DCCD. Measurement of ATPase activity was done by adding
1 mL of ATPase assay buffer containing 10 mM NaATP, 4 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM TrisSO4 (pH 8.5) at 37 °C to the
100 μL aliquots of 16 h DCCD-modified ATP synthase.

Growth
Properties of αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q,
αT349R, βR182A, and αT349R/βR182A Mutants
of E. coli ATP Synthase
Five new single
mutants, αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q, αT349R, and
βR182A, and one double mutant, αT349R/βR182A, were
generated. Residue αThr-349 was chosen for mutagenesis because
of its high level of conservation in the α-subunit VISIT-DG
sequence and proximity to the Pi binding pocket. The αT349A
mutant was used to appreciate the role of the Thr-OH side chain in
Pi binding and the transition state. The αT349Q mutant
was designed to understand the impact of the larger side chain of
Gln on αThr-349. αT349D and αT349R were constructed
to establish the impact of negative and positive charge on the nearby
βR182, a known Pi binding residue. It should be noted
here that the growth properties of βR182A were in excellent
agreement with those published previously9,33 for
the purified F1E. coli ATP synthase.
The motivation behind double mutant αT349R/βR182A was
to determine if Arg on αT349 could compensate for the absence
of Arg on βR182A.

Table 1 shows
that introduction of Ala, Asp, Gln, or Arg as αT349A, αT349D,
αT349Q, αT349R, and βR182A resulted in a loss of
oxidative phosphorylation. All mutations barred growth on succinate-containing
medium, and growth yields in limiting glucose medium were reduced
close to those of the ATP synthase null control. Substantial oxidative
phosphorylation was retained by double mutant αT349R/βR182A.
Specific ATPase activities of membrane-bound F1Fo preparations containing mutant enzymes were compared with wild-type
and null control values, and the values are listed in Table 1. Mutations αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q,
αT349R, and βR182A reduced the ATPase activity by 90–100-fold,
while double mutant αT349R/βR182A reduced ATPase activity
∼6-fold. SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting experiments
yielded results that were in excellent agreement with previously published
data and confirmed that the same amounts of α- and β-subunits
were present in membrane-bound F1Fo as in the
wild type;19,29 therefore, reduced ATPase is
not due to impaired assembly of ATP synthase or loss of F1 during membrane preparation. Moreover, three extra washes reduce
the activity of the null mutant to truly zero. Thus, the low mutant
activities can be attributed only to mutant F1.

and expressed as micromoles of ATP hydrolyzed per minute per milligram

were in excellent agreement within ±10%.

Inhibition of ATPase Activity of ATP Synthase in Membranes by
NBD-Cl and Reversal by Dithiothreitol
All the inhibition
assays were conducted using membrane-bound F1Fo for both membrane preparations and the purified F1 preparation,
provide equivalent assay results, and are highly convenient and less
time-consuming.19,29,30,35,49−52 Figure 2 shows NBD-Cl-induced inhibition
of wild-type and mutant membranes in the presence of varied concentrations
of NBD-Cl. NBD-Cl caused potent inhibition of the wild type with no
residual activity, and this is consistent with previous studies.19,29−33,35 The αT349A mutant was also
almost completely inhibited, while αT349D, αT349Q, αT349R,
βR182A, and αT349R/βR182A were inhibited by ∼85,
90, 90, 60, and 50%, respectively, with ∼10–50% residual
activity. In previous studies, we have noted several instances in
which mutant or wild-type ATP synthase was incompletely inhibited
by inhibitors like fluoroaluminate, fluoroscandium, sodium azide,
NBD-Cl, polyphenols, and peptides.19,29−33,35,49−52 To authenticate that maximal reaction with NBD-Cl had been achieved,
we incubated each membrane-bound F1Fo preparation
with 150 μM NBD-Cl for 1 h as in Figure 2, followed by a supplementary amount of 200 μM NBD-Cl (totaling
350 μM) and continuing the incubation for an extra hour before
assaying ATPase activity. As expected, very little or no additional
inhibition occurred (Figure 3A). This demonstrates
that the reaction of NBD-Cl was complete and that fully reacted αT349D,
αT349Q, αT349R, βR182A, and αT349R/βR182A
mutant F1Fo membranes retained residual activity.
Subsequently, we checked if inactivation by NBD-Cl could be reversed
by addition of the reducing agent DTT because reversibility by DTT
was indicative of specificity of reaction in previous studies. In
this case, wild-type and mutant enzymes were preincubated with 150
μM NBD-Cl as in Figure 2 and then 4 mM
DTT was added and incubation continued for 1 h before the ATPase assay.
It can be seen in Figure 3B that DTT completely
restored full activity in all cases. This proves that NBD-Cl reacts
specifically with residue βTyr-297 in the wild type as well
as in six other mutants.53,54

Figure 2 Inhibition of membrane-bound
wild-type and mutant ATP synthase
by NBD-Cl. Membranes were preincubated for 60 min at room temperature
with varied concentrations of NBD-Cl; then aliquots were added to

are given in Materials and Methods. Symbols:

and (☆) αT349R/βR182A. Each data point represents
an average of at least four experiments, using two or three independent
membrane preparations of each mutant. Results agreed within ±10%.

and reversal of
NBD-Cl effects by DTT. (A) Membrane ATP synthase (Mbr) was inhibited
with 150 μM NBD-Cl for 60 min under the conditions described
in the legend of Figure 2. Then, a further
pulse of 200 μM NBD-Cl was added and incubation continued for
1 h before the assay. (B) Membrane ATP synthase (Mbr) was incubated
with or without 150 μM NBD-Cl for 60 min under the conditions
described in the legend of Figure 2. The degree
of inhibition was assayed. In parallel samples, 4 mM DTT was then
added, and incubation was continued for a further 60 min before the
assay. Each bar graph represents wild type, αT349A, αT349D,
αT349Q, αT349R, βR182A, and αT349R/βR182A
from left to right.

Protection against NBD-Cl
Inhibition of ATPase Activity by MgADP
or Pi
Panels A and B of Figure 4 show the MgADP protection data against NBD-Cl in wild-type
and membrane-bound F1Fo enzymes. It is seen
that wild-type and mutant membranes were similarly protected against
NBD-Cl inhibition. Earlier, we have shown that MgADP protects against
NBD-Cl inhibition of wild-type soluble F1 as well as membrane
preparations of F1Fo; however, protection occurred
only at high concentrations (EC50 ∼ 4.5 mM MgADP).
In this study, the EC50 values were 4.2, 3.1, 3.1, 4.4,
3.6, 2.5, and 4.8 mM for αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q,
αT349R, βR182A, αT349R/βR182A, and the wild
type, respectively. We surmise that high concentrations are required
to effectively keep the βE site occupied by MgADP in time average
and thus hold back the access to NBD-Cl by sterically obstructing
the site.19,29−35 This scheme is consistent with the conclusion of Orris et al.,26 who provided X-ray crystallographic proof that
NBD-Cl reacts specifically in the βE catalytic site. Therefore,
we conclude that NBD-Cl is reacting in βE in the mutants and
that the ATPase activities measured in the mutants can be attributed
to the ATP synthase enzyme and not to a contaminant.

Figure 4 Protection against NBD-Cl
reaction by MgADP. Wild-type and mutant
membrane were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with varied
concentrations of MgADP as shown, and then 150 μM NBD-Cl was
added and incubation continued at room temperature in the dark for
1 h. Aliquots were then assayed for ATPase activity. Symbols: (★)

experiments that agreed within ±10%.

Figure 5 shows the MgPi protection
against the NBD-Cl reaction. It is obvious that Pi protected
well against NBD-Cl inhibition of ATPase activity in the wild type,
αT349R, and αT349R/βR182A but did not protect at
all against NBD-Cl inactivation in αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q,
or βR182A.

Figure 5 Protection by Pi of ATPase activity in wild-type
and
mutant membranes from inactivation by NBD-Cl. Membranes were preincubated
with MgPi at 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 mM as shown, for 60 min at
room temperature. Then NBD-Cl (150 μM) was added, and aliquots
were withdrawn for the assay at time intervals as shown. The ATPase
activity remaining is plotted vs time of incubation with NBD-Cl: (○)
no Pi added, (◊) 2.5 mM Pi, (□)
5 mM Pi, and (△) 10 mM Pi. Each data
point represents the average of four different experiments using two
or three independent membrane preparations of each mutant.

Inhibition of ATPase Activity by Fluoroaluminate,
Fluoroscandium,
and Azide
Subsequently, we examined the effects of transition
state and ground state analogues. Panels A and B of Figure 6 show inhibition of wild-type and mutant enzymes
by MgADP-fluoroaluminate and MgADP-fluoroscandium, respectively. The
wild type was completely inhibited. Levels of AlFx- and ScFx-induced inhibition
of mutants were ∼25 and 32% (αT349A), 5 and 12% (αT349D),
49 and 46% (αT349R), 17 and 22% (βR182A), and 65 and 61%
(αT349R/βR182A), respectively. In contrast, mutant αT349Q
was particularly resistant to inhibition by either MgADP-fluoroaluminate
or MgADP-fluoroscandium. Figure 6C shows that
azide, another potent inhibitor of ATPase in ATP synthase, strongly
inhibited the wild type but showed varied residual activity of ∼53%
(αT349A), ∼90% (αT349D), ∼90% (αT349Q),
∼40% (αT349R), ∼72% (βR182A), and ∼21%
(αT349R/βR182A) in mutants.

Figure 6 Inhibition of membrane
ATPase activity from mutant and wild-type
ATP synthase enzymes by fluoroaluminate, fluoroscandium, and azide.
Membranes were preincubated for 60 min at room temperature with 1
mM MgADP, 10 mM NaF, and the indicated concentration of AlCl3 (A) or ScCl3 (B). Then aliquots were added to 1 mL of
assay buffer, and ATPase activity was determined. Sodium azide was
added directly to the membranes and incubated for 30 min before the
assay (C) (for details, see Materials and Methods). Symbols: (★) wild type, (○) αT349A, (□)

points are means of at least four different experiments using two

was ±10% between different experiments.

Inhibition of ATPase Activity by DCCD
Figure 7 shows the wild-type, αT349A, αT349D,
αT349Q, αT349R, βR182A, and αT349R/βR182A
enzymes inactivated by DCCD. While the wild type is completely inhibited
by 200 μM DCCD after incubation for 16 h at room temperature,
mutants show varied degrees of inhibition. αT349A is inhibited
∼31%, αT349Q ∼7%, αT349R ∼43%, βR182A
∼19%, and αT349R/βR182A ∼72%, while αT349D
is not inhibited at all. In another set of experiments with 2 or 5
h incubations using the same DCCD concentrations and reaction conditions,
we found that the wild type was still fully inhibited, αT349A,
αT349D, αT349Q, αT349R, and βR182A showed
no inhibition, but double mutant αT349R/βR182A was inhibited
maximally by 25% (2 h) and 55% (5 h).

Discussion
The objective of this
study was to examine the functional role(s)
of residue αThr-349 of E. coli ATP synthase.
This residue is part of the strongly conserved α-subunit VISIT-DG
sequence. The VISIT-DG sequence residues are located in the proximity
of the α-subunit−β-subunit interface bordering
the Pi binding pocket (Figure 1B).
X-ray crystal structures of the AlF3-inhibited enzyme27 as well as the AlF4–-inhibited enzyme (which also contained SO42– in a second catalytic site)28 show that
the side chain of residue αThr-349 is very close to these bound
Pi analogues (Figure 1). Pi binding is fundamental for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase. Therefore,
the process of Pi binding can divulge a wealth of information
about ATP synthesis. Mutagenic analysis and molecular modulation of
Pi binding residues are some of the best ways to examine
and appreciate the functional role of residues in the catalytic site.

Earlier studies established that mutagenesis combined with the
use of the Pi protection assay against NBD-Cl inhibition,
as well as the use of inhibitory analogues, allowed the characterization
of functional role(s) of residues suspected to be involved in Pi binding.19,29−35 From analysis of eight such catalytic site residues, we determined
that five residues, namely, αArg-376, βArg-182, βArg-246,
βLys-155, and αSer-347, are critical for Pi binding and form a triangular subdomain within the catalytic site.
While four residues, αArg-376, βArg-182, βArg-246,
and βLys-155, were directly involved in Pi binding,
the fifth residue, αSer-347, supported Pi binding
and transition state stabilization through its interaction with βArg-246
(and possibly with βArg-182, too)19,29−35 (Figure 1B). Earlier, we also established
that introduction of negative or positive charge at this location
resulted in strong alteration of Pi binding,29,31,35 indicating that negative charge
within the triangular subdomain was an important determinant of Pi binding. Here we used the same approaches to study the αThr-349
residue.

Generation of the αT349A, αT349D, αT349Q,
αT349R,
βR182A, or αT349R/βR182A mutant did not affect the
assembly or structural integrity of the membrane ATP synthase. Membrane-bound
F1Fo showed similar contents of F1 α- and β-subunits compared to the wild type. The αT349A,
αT349D, αT349Q, or βR182A mutation caused severe
loss of oxidative phosphorylation as judged by growth on succinate
or limiting glucose medium. Also, strong inhibition of ATPase activity
was observed along with abrogation of Pi binding. The αT349R/βR182A
double mutant allowed Pi binding with substantial oxidative
phosphorylation and ATPase activity. The αT349R mutant was interesting
for it has very little ATPase activity with no oxidative phosphorylation
and still allowed Pi binding just like double mutant αT349R/βR182A
(Table 1 and Figure 5).

Fluoroaluminate and fluoroscandium in combination with MgADP
potently
inhibit wild-type E. coli ATP synthase,19,29−33,35,55,56 and both are believed to mimic the chemical
transition state. Transition state-like structures involving the bound
MgADP–AlF4– complex have been
seen in catalytic sites in ATP synthase by X-ray crystallography.28 MgADP-fluoroaluminate or MgADP-fluoroscandium
failed to inhibit αT349D and αT349Q mutants, indicating
strong destabilization of the transition state, while partial inhibition
occurred in αT349A, and βArg-182, αT349R, and double
mutant αT349R/βR182A, representative of the partial destabilization
of the transition state (Figure 6A,B). These
results are in agreement with the amount of oxidative phosphorylation
and ATPase activity found in each of the mutants. Evidently, α-subunit
VISIT-DG sequence residue αThr-349 is involved directly in the
transition state and in catalysis and therefore should be considered
as a sixth member of the group of Pi binding residues that
make up the triangular Pi binding pocket.

All mutations
affected the degree of inhibition by azide, with
double mutant αT349R/βR182A reducing it substantially
(by ∼80%) and αT349A (∼47%), αT349D (∼10%),
αT349Q (∼10%), αT349R (∼60%), and βR182A
(∼28%) reducing it less severely (Figure 6C). An X-ray crystallographic study of azide-induced inhibition of
ATP hydrolysis57 showed that azide inhibits
ATP synthase by forming a tight binding MgADP–azide complex
in βDP catalytic sites, which resembles that formed by MgADP-beryllium
fluoride, and may therefore be considered an analogue of the MgATP
ground state. In the MgADP–azide complex, the azide occupies
a position equivalent to that of the γ-phosphate of MgATP. Thus,
all mutants also had effects on substrate binding by virtue of an
effect at the γ-P position.

DCCD inhibits wild-type E. coli F1 by
reacting with residue βGlu-19258 and/or cAsp-61,59 with the latter predominating
at lower DCCD concentrations and/or shorter incubation times. As expected,
wild-type ATP synthase was inhibited almost 100%. The αT349D
mutant was not inhibited at all, and αT349A was inhibited ∼30%,
αT349Q ∼7%, αT349R ∼43%, βArg-182
∼20%, and double mutant αT349R/βArg-182 ∼72%
(Figure 7). Notably, at shorter incubation
times, while double mutant αT349R/βArg-182 showed substantial
inhibition, all the single mutations resisted inhibition (see Results). The data therefore indicate that in the
αT349R/βArg-182 double mutant ATPase activity on F1 is partly coupled to proton translocation in Fo, which explains why double mutant αT349R/βArg-182 retains
some growth on succinate and in limiting glucose (Table 1).

It is interesting to note here that Pi binding and release
events have been shown to be directly linked to rotation of the central
stalk in single-molecule experiments.60 Perturbation of the Pi binding site might well be anticipated
to perturb the integrity of the link between Pi binding
and rotation and manifest as uncoupling. Thus, the data for the αThr-349
mutation strongly suggest that the Thr-OH group is needed for transition
state stabilization and Pi binding.

It is established
that Arg residues occur frequently in Pi binding sites
in proteins;30 therefore,
varying the number of Arg residues in the Pi binding site
of ATP synthase seemed to be a useful approach. Residue αThr-349
lies 2.68 and 4.38 Å, 2.86 and 4.01 Å, and 3.61 and 3.40
Å from known Pi binding residues βArg-182 and
αArg-376, respectively, in AlF3-, AlF4-, and SO42–-containing catalytic sites
(nearest atom distances). Thus, one experimental approach we used
was to introduce mutation αT349R into the wild-type background
(with βArg-182) in the presence of the βR182A mutation.
The location of residue αThr-349 at the end of the Pi binding pocket across the catalytic α-subunit−β-subunit
interface with its side chain pointing toward the bound Pi analogues also appeared to be a suitable location for the introduction
of a new Arg. Apparently, the αT349R mutation would place extra
positive charge relatively close to Pi, and double mutation
αT349R/βR182A will allow the αT349R mutant Arg to
fit into the large “hole” generated by the βAla-182
mutation. The βR182A mutant did not show Pi binding,
but the αT349R mutation “rescued” Pi binding in combination with βR182A (Figure 5). On the basis of the loss of oxidative phosphorylation that
was made evident by growth on succinate or limiting glucose medium
along with very low ATPase activity, αArg-349 could be expected
to assume the same exact stereochemical interactions achieved by βArg-182.
Thus, electrostatic interaction per se is therefore important, and
we conclude that the presence of at least one positive charge at this
general location is a requisite determinant of initial Pi binding in catalytic site βE. In addition, the αT349R
mutation in the wild-type background totaling one extra positive charge
did not prevent Pi binding (Figure 5), but the presence of negative charge in the form of αT349D
resulted in abrogation of Pi binding. Presumably, the presence
of Asp negated the positive charge of nearby residue βArg-182,
resulting in the abrogation of Pi binding.

αThr-349
is positioned close to bound AlF4– in
catalytic sites (see Figure 1B).28 The Thr-OH lies 5.46 Å from
the F3 atom in AlF4– and thus may contribute
to transition state stabilization by direct interaction. It may be
mentioned that a similar conclusion was reached regarding the -OH
group contributed by αSer-347 of the E. coli VISIT-DG sequence19 and Ser-OH of the
highly conserved “LSGGQ” ABC signature sequence in P-glycoprotein.61 Considering how Pi binding is affected,
αThr-349-OH lies 6.44 Å from O2 in SO42–28 and 5.56 Å from F1 of AlF3 in the respective catalytic sites.27 Thus, some direct interaction may be operative. However, more important
than the findings described above may be the fact that the Thr-OH
lies 2.86 Å from NH2 of βArg-182 (in the AlF4– site) and 2.68 Å from NH2 of βArg-182
in the AlF3-occupied site. βArg-182 is strongly conserved
and critical for Pi binding and transition state stabilization.9,33 Further, the carbonyl O of αThr-349 lies 3.40 and 3.63 Å
from NH1 and NH2, respectively, of αArg-376, another Pi binding residue. The likely H-bond interaction between αThr-349
and βArg-182 (and αArg-376) suggests these residues act
together to support Pi binding and transition state stabilization.

In summary, the αThr-349 residue of the conserved VISIT-DG
sequence in the ATP synthase α-subunit is required for catalysis,
Pi binding, and transition state stabilization. Introduction
of Arg at this site can compensate for the absence of Arg at the known
Pi binding residue βArg-182 site. Furthermore, arrangement
of positive charges with respect to one another is of paramount importance
for oxidative phosphorylation and Pi binding.
