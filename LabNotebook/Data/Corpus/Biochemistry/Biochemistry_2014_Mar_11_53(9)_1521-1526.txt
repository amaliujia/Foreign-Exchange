Single-cell
organisms can behave
as an organized community through a variety of different communication
mechanisms. Such behavior can be beneficial
as a defense mechanism, such as in biofilm formation,, or as an offensive mechanism for success in a highly competitive
environment. The generation of different
signaling molecules, produced from the enzyme-catalyzed diversion
of essential metabolic intermediates, can lead to the activation of
unique sets of genes in response to different external stimuli. One
of these essential metabolites, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), serves as the precursor for two structurally
distinct classes of signaling molecules that are used as quorum sensors
by a variety of bacterial species.

AdoMet is a highly versatile
metabolite that participates in a
wide variety of group transfer reactions, including the transfer of
methyl, aminopropyl, and adenosyl groups, as well as a variety of radical generation reactions. In particular, AdoMet functions as a donor in
the methylation reactions of DNA, RNA, and proteins as well as the
methylation of small molecules such as phospholipids and various neurotransmitters., In addition to these essential roles in mammalian metabolism, AdoMet
is also the precursor for the production of two different classes
of quorum sensing molecules, acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) and furanosyl
borate diesters, in certain species of bacteria. These compounds regulate the expression of a large number
of bacterial genes, including those associated with virulence in human
pathogenic organisms. Many of these quorum-responsive
genes produce virulence factors that cause disease pathology, as well
as the components required for assembly of the polysaccharide matrix
of biofilms that can protect microbes against antibiotics. Preventing the production of quorum sensing molecules
would block an important signaling pathway that leads to virulence
in many Gram-negative bacteria. However,
any interference with the essential roles of AdoMet would be detrimental
to a mammalian host and would also provide strong selective pressure
for resistance by the targeted bacteria. The challenge is to block
bacterial signaling without affecting mammalian metabolism and ideally
to have a minimal effect on bacterial metabolism. This should be possible,
as the biosynthesis of acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum signals
uses portions of AdoMet (the amino and carboxyl groups of the methionine
moiety) that are not directly required for most other group transfer
reactions from AdoMet.

Several methionine analogues that can
function as effective substrates
for AdoMet synthetases from Gram-negative bacterial human pathogens
have been identified. The AdoMet analogue
products from these enzyme-catalyzed transformations have modified
functional groups that should effectively block them from serving
as precursors for the AHL class of quorum sensing molecules, but to
be viable starting points for the development of antivirulence drugs,
these AdoMet analogues must still be capable of participating in the
diverse group transfer reactions that are essential both for microbial
and for mammalian metabolism. This work examines the ability of these
AdoMet analogues to function as methyl donors for two divergent targets:
the methylation of a carbon atom in bacterial DNA and the small molecule
methylation of an oxygen atom in a specific class of mammalian neurotransmitters.

Experimental
Procedures
Materials
pUC19 DNA was acquired from New England BioLabs
(NEB) and propagated in the Escherichia coli XL-1
Blue strain under ampicillin selection. Plasmids were purified using
a miniprep plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen). DNA CpG methyltransferase
(M.SssI) and the restriction enzymes used for DNA mapping were also
purchased from NEB. Methionine analogues were either purchased or
synthesized as described previously and
were used as freshly prepared stock solutions adjusted to neutral
pH. Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMTase) was purchased
from Calzyme Laboratories Inc., while (−)-epinephrine (+)-bitartrate, S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-methionine (AdoMet), and S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy)
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the other reagents were of
the highest purity available.

Enzyme Purification
The metK genes
of Neisseria meningitidis and Campylobacter
jejuni were cloned into E. coli BL21(DE3)
expression cells. The S-adenosyl-l-methionine
synthetases (AdoMet synthetases, MetK) were purified using our previously
published protocol. Briefly, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing cloned metK genes were grown in LB medium containing ampicillin, induced with
1 mM isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at
28 °C, and then grown to a high cell density. Each of these His-tagged
enzymes was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using a linear
imidazole gradient, followed by anion exchange chromatography and
elution with a linear KCl gradient. Purified MetK enzymes from each
source were concentrated and either examined immediately or stored
at −80 °C until they were used in a glycerol-containing
storage buffer.

Synthesis of AdoMet and
AdoMet Analogues
AdoMet and
its derivatives were synthesized in vitro by the
AdoMet synthetase-catalyzed reaction that uses ATP to activate methionine.
Varying concentrations of l-methionine or methionine analogues
were incubated with MgATP and AdoMet synthetase (0.4 mg/mL) in a buffer
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 15 mM MgCl2. AdoMet
and its analogues were quantified by liquid chromatography using a
Waters high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. A calibration
curve was generated by using AdoMet concentrations from 12.5 to 600
μM, and the amounts of AdoMet or AdoMet analogues produced from
the AdoMet synthetase reaction were determined after the appropriate
dilutions. This enzyme-catalyzed reaction was conducted for an extended
time period to obtain the maximal levels of each AdoMet analogue used
in the subsequent methyl transfer reactions. The synthetic reaction
was quenched by spin filtration to remove the enzyme, and the resulting
mixture was used as the substrate for the DNA and catechol methylation
reactions.

DNA Protection Assay
The DNA protection
assay was designed
to determine the efficiency of DNA methylation by AdoMet and AdoMet
analogues. The pUC19 plasmid was linearized with HindIII, to eliminate
the effect of different plasmid conformations on restriction enzyme
accessibility and facilitate site mapping during the DNA protection
assay. Initial optimization of this assay was conducted by varying
the enzyme concentration (2–4 units of M.SssI), the concentration
of purchased AdoMet (up to 320 μM), and the reaction time (from
30 to 60 min). Once optimized, the AdoMet synthesis reaction described
above was used to produce either AdoMet or AdoMet analogues. After
the reaction had been quenched and the AdoMet products quantitated,
100 μM AdoMet or AdoMet esters (or the maximal amount obtained
for the lower-yielding N-derivatized AdoMet products) were added to
approximately 1 μg of linearized pUC19 DNA. The methylation
reaction was then initiated by the addition of 4 units of DNA methyltransferase,
M.SssI, in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mM NaCl,
10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT in a 10 μL reaction volume
at 37 °C. M.SssI selectively generates 5-methylcytosine at CpG
sequences. The extent of DNA CpG methylation was determined at various
times by restriction digestion with 10 units of HpaII, a restriction
endonuclease that is not capable of cleaving DNA at its CCGG recognition
site if the central CpG is methylated. Digestion of the methylated
DNA with MspI served as a control, because this enzyme cleaves at
the same restriction site as HpaII but is not sensitive to DNA methylation
at the internal cytosine. Restriction digestions were conducted according
to the NEB protocols. The restriction fragments obtained after these
reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels in
TAE buffer, with the bands visualized as negative images from ethidium
bromide fluorescence staining. The degree of protection of pUC19 DNA
afforded by methylation with the various AdoMet analogues was analyzed
using gel digitizing software (UN-SCAN-IT Gel version 6.1) to compare
the relative amount of fully methylated DNA to the total amount of
DNA present.

Catechol Methylation Assay
The formation
of AdoHcy
during the methylation of epinephrine by COMTase, using the AdoMet
or AdoMet analogues synthesized as described above, was monitored
by an HPLC-based end point assay. Methylation reaction mixtures contained
epinephrine (2.5 mM), COMTase (0.2 mg/mL), and AdoMet or AdoMet ester
analogues (100 μM from the AdoMet synthetase reaction) at 37
°C in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.25 mM dithiothreitol. At different times, 20 μL
samples from these reaction mixtures were injected into a reversed
phase C18 column (particle size of 5 μm, 150 mm × 4.6 mm,
Thermo Fisher) equilibrated with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.2). The AdoHcy product was separated from the reactants by using
a linear gradient of 40% acetonitrile in a gradient HPLC system (Waters
dual pumps 515, Waters Corp.) and quantified by its absorbance at
254 nm using an absorbance detector (Waters Corp.).

Results
Examination
of DNA Methylation by AdoMet
MetK catalyzes
the adenylation of methionine to produce the primary biological methyl
donor, AdoMet. The MetK reaction was optimized to yield a final concentration
of AdoMet sufficient for complete protection of 1 μg of pUC19
DNA by M.SssI methyltransferase (see below). To achieve this optimization,
the amounts of l-methionine and MgATP substrates were varied,
along with the reaction time. A gel-based assay was designed to examine
the ability of newly synthesized AdoMet and AdoMet analogues to function
as donors of methyl groups to DNA. Without methylation to protect
the linearized pUC19 DNA, treatment with HpaII restriction endonuclease
results in the expected cleavage at 14 different sites, leading to
fragments that range in size from 26 to 501 bp. Fully methylated DNA
is protected against cleavage and yields a single band at 2.69 kb,
while partially methylated DNA gives bands between 0.5 and 2.69 kb
depending on the extent of methylation. Complete protection of the
pUC19 DNA was attained by reacting 4 mM l-methionine and
MgATP for 60 min (Figure , lane 5) using the
more active C. jejuni form of AdoMet synthetase.

Optimization of AdoMet production catalyzed by AdoMet
synthetase.
The products of a coupled reaction are shown, where AdoMet synthetase
produces AdoMet, which is then used by M.SssI to methylate substrate
DNA (linearized pUC19). The concentrations of substrates l-methionine and MgATP were each increased from 0.5 to 6 mM for the
60 min reaction time, followed by restriction digestion with HpaII
and gel electrophoresis, shown as a negative image of an ethidium-stained
agarose gel, to determine the extent of DNA methylation achieved with
each substrate level.

Optimization of the DNA Methyltransferase Assay
To
measure the ability of AdoMet analogues to serve as DNA methyl donors,
a sensitive assay for DNA methylation is needed. Methylation of linearized
pUC19 DNA was optimized by varying the level of the M.SssI methyltransferase,
the AdoMet concentration, and the reaction time for DNA methylation
(Figure ). Virtually complete methylation
of pUC19 DNA was achieved, as evidenced by the failure of HpaII to
cleave the DNA, by using 320 μM AdoMet and 4 units of M.SssI,
with the reaction conducted for at least 1 h in a buffer containing
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM MgCl2 (Figure , lane 7).

Restriction endonuclease
analysis of pUC19 DNA after methylation.
DNA was incubated for 30 or 60 min with either 160 or 320 μM
AdoMet at a fixed amount of M.SssI DNA methyltransferase in the presence
or absence of added MgCl2, followed by restriction digestion
with HpaII.

An additional concern
during assay development was a report that
the M.SssI DNA methyltransferase activity becomes less processive
and has a decreased affinity for its DNA substrate in the presence
of higher levels of Mg2+. Therefore,
the effect of Mg2+ ions on the DNA protection assay was
evaluated under our optimized assay conditions. M.SssI methylates
the pUC19 DNA substrate very efficiently in the absence of added Mg2+, but somewhat less efficiently at higher Mg2+ levels (Figure , buffer – and buffer
+ lanes, respectively). Therefore, to eliminate any interference,
the MgCl2 concentration required for optimal MetK-catalyzed
synthesis of AdoMet was diluted to ∼1 mM when AdoMet or AdoMet
analogue products were examined as potential methyl donors in the
DNA methylation reactions.

DNA Methylation Capability of AdoMet Analogues
The
AdoMet synthetases (MetKs) purified from several Gram-negative bacterial
pathogens can use different l-methionine derivatives as substrates,
converting them to the corresponding AdoMet analogues. To evaluate the methyl donor ability of these
AdoMet analogues, MetKs were used to generate these product analogues,
which were then tested as potential substrates for the DNA methyltransferase,
M.SssI. The MetK from C. jejuni has the highest overall
catalytic efficiency among the enzymes from this family that have
been studied and was used initially to
generate the AdoMet analogues.

The various methionine esters
each led to AdoMet products that were examined at 100 μM and
found to serve as donors of methyl groups to DNA. l-Methionine
and l-methionine ethyl ester (MEE) are each excellent substrates
for C. jejuni MetK, and each supported significant
DNA methylation, as demonstrated by the substantial protection from
cleavage by the restriction endonuclease HpaII, with a very low abundance
of bands below 500 bp (Figure , lanes 2 and
4); the great majority of DNA is found as the full-length, completely
methylated linear substrate (2.69 kb). Control digestion of the fully
methylated DNA with MspI showed the expected total cleavage, because
MspI nuclease recognizes the same sites as HpaII but is not affected
by CpG methylation (not shown, but similar to the results seen in
Figure , lane 6). The methyl ester of methionine
(MME) is a somewhat poorer substrate for MetK and also led to a smaller
fraction of totally methylated DNA (Figure , lane 3).

DNA methylation by M.SssI using different AdoMet analogues produced
by the AdoMet synthetase-catalyzed activation of methionine derivatives.
The methionine substrates included l-methionine (Met), l-methionine methyl (MME) and ethyl (MEE) esters produced by C. jejuni AdoMet synthetase and tested at 100 ± 5 μM,
and N-acetyl-l-methionine (NAM) and N,N-dimethylmethionine (DMM) produced by N. meningitidis AdoMet synthetase and tested at ∼10
and &lt;5 μM, respectively. The methylation of 1 μg of
linearized pUC19 DNA was conducted for 1 h at 37 °C, followed
by digestion with HpaII and gel electrophoresis.

The N-derivatized methionine analogues, N-acetyl-l-methionine (NAM) and N,N-dimethyl-l-methionine (DMM), are very poor substrates
for
the MetKs, and the limited amount of AdoMet analogue products obtained
from these reactions catalyzed by C. jejuni MetK
was not sufficient to provide any detectable level of DNA methylation.
The MetK from N. meningitidis uses N-acetyl-l-methionine as a substrate with the highest efficiency
of members of this enzyme family. Switching
to this enzyme form and extending the reaction time to 2 h resulted
in a greater production of the N-acetylated AdoMet analogue (∼10
μM) that was sufficient to cause partial methylation of DNA
from this donor (Figure , lane 5). The extremely
poor N,N-dimethyl-l-methionine
MetK substrate yielded low levels of the corresponding AdoMet analogue
(&lt;5 μM), and this level of product did not lead to any significant
amount of DNA protection (Figure , lane 6).

Efficiency of DNA Methylation
As described above, the
AdoMet derivative of l-methionine ethyl ester showed a level
of protection of pUC19 DNA under the experimental condition tested
that was nearly the same as that achieved by AdoMet (Figure , lanes 2 and 4). To more accurately assess the
methyl donor efficiency of the AdoMet ester analogues, the M.SssI
DNA methyltransferase reaction was followed over different times using
a fixed level (100 μM) of the in situ-generated
AdoMet analogues. A parallel reaction with AdoMet formation from methionine
served as the benchmark for comparison. A slightly lower rate of DNA
protection was achieved with the AdoMet ethyl ester, with an initial
rate of methylated DNA production (11 ng/min) that was ∼70%
of that achieved with AdoMet as a methyl donor (Figure ). The rate of DNA methylation with the AdoMet methyl ester
(8 ng/min) was approximately half of that obtained with AdoMet under
these reaction conditions. Similar differences in the methyl transfer
efficiency of each AdoMet analogue were observed when the amount of
fully methylated DNA produced was compared when the reaction time
was extended to 60 min (Figure ).

Efficiency
of DNA methylation with AdoMet analogues determined
at a fixed level (100 μM) of each substrate at different time
intervals at 37 °C. The amount of fully methylated DNA was determined
by the total pixel count of the largest band that represents the fully
protected pUC19 DNA using AdoMet (◆), AdoMet ethyl ester (▲),
or AdoMet methyl ester (■) as the methyl donor.

Catechol Methylation by AdoMet Analogues
While some
of the AdoMet analogues have now been shown to function proficiently
as donors of methyl to DNA, it is not clear that they can effectively
replace AdoMet with other methyltransferases having unrelated substrates.
To assess the range of ability of the AdoMet analogues to serve as
methyl donors, we sought to test an additional methyltransferase that
is only distantly related to M.SssI. Catechol O-methyltransferase
(COMTase) is in the same general methyltransferase fold (class I)
as M.SssI, but the amino acid sequences
of the two proteins are only &lt;10% identical. In addition, COMTase
is a mammalian enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of a small molecule
substrate and targets an oxygen atom as the methyl acceptor rather
than the carbon atom target of M.SssI.

First, a new assay was
needed to follow this methyl transfer reaction. Because of the similar
absorption spectra of the substrates and products in the COMTase-catalyzed
reaction, and also the failure to develop an efficient enzyme-coupled
assay, it became necessary to separate the reactants to measure the
rates of the catechol methylation reaction. The rate of epinephrine
methylation was examined by measuring the production of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) in an HPLC-based assay.
The separation of ATP, AdoMet, and AdoHcy is dependent on the pH of
the mobile phase (data not shown), with the best separation achieved
in phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. Under these conditions, the ATP substrate
for AdoMet production eluted at 2.7 min, while AdoMet and AdoHcy eluted
around 4 and 5.6 min, respectively (Figure A).

(AdoHcy) product. (B) Time course for the production of S-adenosylhomocysteine during the methylation of epinephrine using
AdoMet (◆), AdoMet methyl ester (■), or AdoMet ethyl
ester (▲) as the methyl donor.

To determine the relative methylation efficiencies of the
different
AdoMet analogues, catechol O-methylation was performed by using the
same amount of AdoMet and its analogues (100 ± 5 μM) that
was used for DNA methylation, with the reaction time course monitored
from 0 to 15 min. The initial velocity of the methyl transfer reaction
was calculated by plotting the AdoHcy or AdoHcy analogue concentration
(determined by HPLC peak area) versus time (Figure B). As was observed with DNA methylation, AdoMet ethyl ester
is nearly as efficient as a methyl donor as AdoMet for the methylation
of epinephrine, with an initial rate that is ∼80% of that achieved
with AdoMet. The AdoMet methyl ester is also a viable donor of methyl
to this catechol, with a rate that is ∼60% of that achieved
by AdoMet under these reaction conditions (Figure B). Evidence of the AdoHcy product was also observed when
the AdoMet analogue obtained from N-acetyl-l-methionine was used as the methyl donor. However, the low levels
of this AdoMet analogue made it hard to reliably determine the concentration
of the AdoHcy product and therefore difficult to measure the rate
of catechol methylation.

Discussion
Production of Quorum Signal
Molecules
The production
of acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), which function as quorum sensing
molecules, diverts the essential metabolite AdoMet for use as a precursor.
The enzyme-catalyzed reaction for AHL production requires a free carboxyl
group in the methionine moiety of AdoMet for lactone formation and
a free methionine amino group for acylation. Derivatizing either of these functional groups would interfere with
AHL formation, effectively blocking quorum signaling. We have recently
shown that methionine derivatives with modified carboxyl or amino
groups can still function as viable substrates for AdoMet synthetases
from various Gram-negative pathogens, leading to the production of
modified AdoMet analogues. The next critical
question that needed to be addressed was whether the AdoMet analogues
produced in these reactions can still participate in each of the critical
roles that are required both in bacterial and in mammalian metabolism.

DNA Methylation
The methylation of DNA is an essential
step that controls the regulation of gene expression in metazoa. DNA methylation is less critical for gene regulation
in bacteria but plays important roles in chromosome replication, mismatch repair, and restriction–modification systems. Several AdoMet analogues, produced from methionine analogues
that were derivatized at either the α-amino group or the α-carboxyl
group and incapable of supporting AHL biosynthesis, have been shown
here to function as methyl donors for DNA methylation. In particular,
the AdoMet ester derivatives support efficient DNA methylation, at
rates that are within a factor of 2 of that achieved with unmodified
AdoMet. N-Derivatized AdoMet analogues were also examined, but while
these derivatives can also serve as donors for DNA methylation, the
levels of methylated DNA produced were quite low. The low level of
production of methyl-protected DNA with the N-derivatized AdoMet analogues
is certainly related to the low levels of these compounds obtained
from the MetK-catalyzed synthesis. Extending the MetK reaction time
to 3 h for N,N-dimethyl-l-methionine in the presence of N. meningitidis AdoMet
synthetase led to the production of &lt;5 μM AdoMet analogue
product. Treating the DNA substrate with this 20-fold lower level
of the AdoMet analogue produces barely detectable DNA methylation
products. Further optimization of AdoMet analogue synthesis is certainly
possible, but any methionine derivatives would be administered as
prodrugs that must be converted in vivo into methyl
donor molecules. For these alternative N-derivatized methionine analogue
substrates to block quorum signal production, overcoming competition
from the endogenous methionine and AdoMet produced by these pathogenic
organisms would be difficult to achieve. Success with this approach
will require modification of the most potent alternative MetK substrates
into stable derivatives that retain their capacity to serve as methyl
donors.

Small Molecule Methylation
The methylation of catechol-type
neurotransmitters is the initial step toward their subsequent degradation,
a process needed to modulate signal levels. As with DNA methylation,
AdoMet functions as the physiological methyl donor to initiate this
breakdown. AdoMet analogues designed to block quorum signaling must
still be capable of participating in these essential mammalian metabolic
functions. The AdoMet derivatives that were functional methyl donors
for DNA methylation were also found to be excellent substrates for
the methylation of epinephrine. In fact, the relative rates of DNA
methylation with the ethyl and methyl ester derivatives of AdoMet
were nearly identical to those achieved for catechol methylation when
the rates were examined relative to that achieved with AdoMet.

Conclusions
The results from these new studies establish that AdoMet analogues,
produced by MetK from methionine derivatives and impaired for AHL
quorum signal biosynthesis, can participate in one of their primary
metabolic roles by functioning as effective methyl donors to DNA and
the small molecule epinephrine.

The authors declare no
competing financial interest.
