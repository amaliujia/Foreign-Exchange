Introduction
Calcineurin (CN) is
a Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) activated
serine/threonine phosphatase that is widely distributed in mammalian
tissues. CN functions in signal transduction
pathways to regulate gene expression and participates in a wide variety
of physiological processes including skeletal muscle differentiation
and regeneration, cardiac hypertrophy, and neuronal signaling.− CN is a heterodimeric protein complex comprised of a ∼60
kDa catalytic subunit, CNA, and a ∼19 kDa regulatory subunit,
CNB. As shown in Figure , there are four well-established
domains in CNA: (i) a catalytic domain (14A-342A, where the number and subscript letter indicate the residue number
and the corresponding subunit (i.e., CNA), respectively), (ii) a CNB
binding domain (343A-373A), (iii) a CaM interaction
region (390A-414A), and (iv) an autoinhibitory
(AI) motif (469A-486A)., In
addition, a section of the unstructured region within the CNA subunit
that is important for stabilizing the interactions within CNA upon
calmodulin binding has recently been identified.− The CN active
site, which is located in the catalytic domain, contains a binuclear
metal center that is critical for phosphatase activity. The two metals
have been identified as Zn, which is coordinated with Asn150A, His199A, and His281A, (the subscript number
and letter indicate the residue number and the CN subunit, respectively),
and Fe, which is coordinated with Asp90A and His92A.,,− The existence of both Fe3+-Zn2+,,, and Fe2+-Zn2+, forms have
been reported, and the oxidation states of Fe in the active enzyme
remain inconclusive. The CNB subunit is a CaM-like protein possessing
four EF-Hand Ca2+ binding domains. The Ca2+ binding regions I (31B-42B) and II (63B-74B), located close to the N-terminus,
have relatively low Ca2+ affinity,− whereas Ca2+ binding regions III (100B-111B) and
IV (141B-152B), located close to the C-terminus,
have relatively high affinity and are occupied even in unstimulated
cells where the Ca2+ concentration is lower than 10–7 M. Under normal conditions, the binuclear metal active
site located in the groove of the CNA catalytic domain is blocked
by AI and the enzyme is inactive. Upon an increase in Ca2+ concentration during extracellular stimulation, CaM activation caused
by Ca2+ binding enables its interaction with the CaM binding
domain in CNA and removes the AI domain from the catalytic site, resulting
in CN activation. Moreover, Ca2+ occupancy of the two N-terminal
low-affinity sites causes a conformational change in the tightly associated
CNA and facilitates the binding of CNA with CaM.

For the CNA subunit (UnitProt entry Q08209), the catalytic domain is color
coded in purple, the CNB binding motif is in red, the CaM interaction
domain is in green, and the autoinhibitory region is in orange. For
the CNB subunit (UnitProt entry P63098), the EF-hands are color coded
in blue, and the corresponding Ca2+-binding pockets are
color coded in cyan. Regions of the protein sequences not visible
in the crystal structure (PDB entry 1AUI) are in italic
text.

CN is reported to be inactivated
by H2O2-
or superoxide-induced oxidation both in vivo and in vitro.− Several mechanisms for this inactivation have been proposed. One
mechanism postulated that the redox regulation of CN is induced by
the formation of a disulfide bridge between two vicinal cysteine residues
in the catalytic region of CNA. However,
how the bridging affects CN enzymatic activity remains unclear as
the only pair of conserved cysteine residues (Cys228A and
Cys256A) which could form the disulfide bond are not close
to the active binuclear metal center., A bridging-induced
conformational change in the catalytic domain of CNA was proposed
as the cause of inactivation; however, this hypothesis has not been
demonstrated experimentally. Another proposal suggested that the binuclear
active site exists as Fe2+-Zn2+ and that CN
inactivation is caused by oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. However, this finding is in conflict
with many previous studies demonstrating Fe3+-Zn2+ as the form with maximum activity.,, Previously, Carruthers et al. reported that Met406A, located in the CaM binding motif of CNA, was highly susceptible
to oxidation, resulting in a shift in Ca2+-dependence and
a decrease in CaM/CN binding affinity, suggesting that oxidative inactivation
of CN is caused by direct inhibition of the CN-CaM interaction. However, it was found that oxidation of a CN
mutant lacking Met406A (i.e., M406AL) also showed
reduced activity, indicating that oxidation of Met406A was
not solely responsible for the observed oxidation-induced CN inactivation.
For example, global or local conformational changes associated with
the oxidation of methionine residues located within structurally important
regions of the CN complex, such as the Ca2+ binding domains,
could also play a critical role in the oxidative inactivation process.
However, this hypothesis has not been examined to date.

Mass
spectrometry, in conjunction with selective covalent labeling
of accessible amino acid side functional groups, can be used to provide
structural information (albeit relatively low resolution) about changes
in protein surfaces and conformations occurring as a result of protein
folding or unfolding, protein–protein interactions, protein–ligand
binding, or protein modification.− However, identification
and characterization of the often low abundance modified peptides
within a complex mixture of largely unmodified peptides that is typically
generated following proteolytic digestion of a large protein or protein
complex, and quantification of the modification site occupancies (i.e.,
the determinant of accessibility at a specific residue), present a
significant analytical challenge. Previously, we reported the development
of a strategy for mapping solvent-accessible lysine residues within
proteins, via covalent labeling with a novel amine-specific protein
modification reagent, S,S′-dimethylthiobutanoylhydroxysuccinimide
ester (DMBNHS), and its application to a model protein, namely, human
cellular retinoic acid binding protein II. After reaction at different reagent to protein ratios, followed
by protein digestion, capillary HPLC-ESI-MS and automated collision-induced
dissociation–tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) in an ion
trap mass spectrometer, the modified peptides, and the number of modifications
within each peptide, were readily identified via the dominant characteristic
neutral loss(es) of a dimethylsulfide moiety from the modified lysine
amino acid side chain., The observation of the neutral
losses were then used to automatically trigger the acquisition of
a “data-dependent neutral loss mode” MS3 spectrum
for peptide sequence and modification site(s) characterization. Using
this approach, the experimentally determined relative accessibilities
of the various lysine residues within CRABP II were found to show
good agreement with those calculated from the known solution structure.

Here, the relative susceptibility of CN
methionine residues toward
H2O2-induced oxidation was first determined
using a multienzyme digestion strategy coupled with capillary HPLC-ESI-MS
and -MS/MS. Then, the DMBNHS chemical labeling and tandem mass spectrometry
analysis strategy described above was applied to map changes in the
accessibility of lysine residues between native and oxidized forms
of CN, to identify regions within the protein complex that undergo
significant conformational perturbation upon oxidative modification
and therefore may be involved in the mechanism(s) responsible for
oxidation-induced CN inactivation.

Sequencing grade Lys-C was obtained from Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis,

as described previously.

Protein Oxidation
Ten microliters of 250 mM H2O2 was added
(final H2O2 concentration:
12 mM) to 200 μL aliquots of 0.40 μg/μL CN in 10
mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) (10 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2) and 0.1 mM CaCl2. Oxidation was allowed to occur at
room temperature in the dark for 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min,
and then 40 μL of catalase in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) was
added and the reaction was quenched at room temperature for 5 min.
After oxidation, each aliquot was divided into nine samples and then
stored at −80 °C until further use. A control native CN
sample (i.e., time 0) was also prepared by adding 50 μL of 10
mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) to 200 μL of 0.40 μg/μL
CN solution in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6).

DMBNHS Protein Modification
Six aliquots of each CN
sample (i.e., 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min time points) were
modified by the addition of 1 μL of DMBNHS solution dissolved
in 25%DMF/75%H2O (prepared immediately before use) at concentrations
of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mM. After incubation for 30 min
at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of
8 μL of Tris (pH 8.3) at a 160-fold molar excess over DMBNHS
and then stored at −80 °C until further use.

Protein Digestion
Each of the CN samples described
above were diluted with 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) to a final volume
of 44 μL followed by addition of 8 μL of 10 mM EGTA. Reduction
and alkylation of CN disulfide bonds were then performed by the addition
of 2 μL of 0.1 M DTT and incubation at 60 °C for 30 min,
followed by the addition of 2 μL of 0.25 M iodoacetamide and
further reaction at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Two microliters
of 0.1 M DTT was then added to inactivate excess iodoacetamide at
room temperature for 30 min and diluted with 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH
7.6) to a final volume of 70 μL. The three aliquots of each
of the CN samples at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min H2O2 oxidation time points were then digested separately
with Glu-C, trypsin, and Lys-C, while the DMBNHS-modified CN samples
were digested only with Glu-C. For digestion using Glu-C, the pH of
the CN samples was adjusted to 8.0 with 0.2 M NaOH followed by addition
of 4 μL of 0.1 μg/μL Glu-C in H2O. The
digestion was performed at 30 °C for 16 h. For trypsin digestion,
the pH of the CN samples was adjusted to 7.8 with 0.2 M NaOH followed
by addition of 4 μL of 0.2 μg/μL trypsin in H2O, and then the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C
for 16 h. For Lys-C digestion, the pH of the CN sample was brought
up to 8.0 with 0.2 M NaOH followed by addition of 4 μL of 0.2
μg/μL Lys-C in H2O and digestion for 16 h at
37 °C. Finally, 0.5 μL of formic acid was added to inactivate
the proteases, and then the samples were stored at −20 °C
until further analysis.

Mass Spectrometry Analysis
HPLC-ESI-MS
followed by
data-dependent CID and/or electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-MS/MS
analysis of the digests from oxidized CN samples, and HPLC-ESI-MS
followed by data-dependent constant neutral loss (DDCNL) CID-MS/MS,
-MS3, or targeted ETD-MS/MS analysis of the digests from
DMBNHS-modified CN samples, were performed using a Thermo Fisher Scientific
LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo, San Jose, CA, USA) coupled
with an Advance nESI source and Paradigm MS4 capillary RP-HPLC system
(Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using
automated methods created by the Xcalibur software (Thermo, San Jose,
CA, USA). Five microliters of each sample (0.20 pmol/μL for
digests of native or oxidized CN samples, and 0.35 pmol/μL for
digests of native or oxidized DMBNHS-modified CN samples) in 3% acetic
acid/5% acetonitrile was loaded from a Paradigm AS1 autosampler (Michrom
Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) onto a peptide CapTrap (Michrom Bioresources,
Auburn, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 15 μL/min using 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid/2% acetonitrile as the loading buffer. After 5 min loading time,
the peptides concentrated on the peptide CapTrap were eluted onto
a 200 μm id × 50 mm fused silica column packed with Magic
C18AQ (3 μm) (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) at a flow
rate of 2 μL/min using a linear 45 min (for digests from native
or oxidized CN samples) or 70 min (for digests from native or oxidized
DMBNHS-modified CN samples) gradient from 95% solvent A (0.1% formic
acid in H2O) to 50% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in CH3CN).

The ion transfer tube of the mass spectrometer
was set at 250 °C, and the spray voltage was maintained at 1.4
kV. The S-lens was set at 57%. Full MS scans were acquired from m/z 300–2000 in the Orbitrap mass
analyzer at a mass resolving power of 60 000. Full scans were
taken at an AGC target value of 2.0 × 105, with a
10 ms maximum injection time in the ion trap. All spectra were recorded
in centroid mode. The isolation window was maintained at 2.0 m/z for all MS/MS and MS3 analysis.
During CID-MS/MS and -MS3, using an AGC target value of
1.0 × 104 and a 100 ms maximum injection time in the
ion trap, isolated precursor ions were fragmented with a normalized
collision energy of 35% with an activation time of 10 ms and an activation q value of 0.25. For ETD-MS/MS, the AGC target value and
maximum injection time was the same as the CID-MS/MS experiments,
while the AGC target value and maximum injection time of the fluoranthene
reagent anion were set at 2.0 × 104 and 100 ms, respectively.
ETD was carried out with supplemental activation enabled, at a normalized
energy of 15%. The activation time was optimized between 60 ms and
100 ms for the 2+ charge state and proportionally scaled down for
higher charge states (e.g., if a 60 ms reaction time was used for
a 2+ charge state, a 40 ms reaction time was used for the 3+ charge
state, a 30 ms reaction time was used for a 4+ charge state, etc.).
Except for targeted ETD-MS/MS analysis, dynamic exclusion was enabled
to acquire three MS/MS or MS3 scans on a given precursor
ion within 30 s, prior to dynamic exclusion for 10 s.

For both
CID- and ETD-MS/MS analysis of the digests from oxidized
CN, the mass spectrometer was programmed to operate in a data-dependent
mode, where each survey MS scan was followed by MS/MS of the five
most intense ions (signal threshold was set at 1.0 × 104 counts). For CID-MS/MS and -MS3 analysis of the digests
from native or oxidized DMBNHS-modified CN, the mass spectrometer
was operated in a DDCNL mode by performing CID-MS/MS scans on the
five most intense ions from each MS survey scan, while simultaneously
searching for defined neutral losses (within an m/z variance of ±0.5) corresponding to single,
double, and triple S(CH3)2 neutral losses from
[MN+ + (m-N)H]m+ precursor ions, where M represents the peptide, N represents the number of modifications, and m represents different charge states ranging from +2 to +5 (see ). If a predefined neutral loss was
detected above a threshold abundance of 1.0 × 104 counts,
CID-MS3 was automatically initiated to isolate then further
dissociate the most intense neutral loss product ion. For targeted
ETD-MS/MS analysis of digests from native or oxidized DMBNHS-modified
CN, the mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode where
only predefined precursor ions of interest observed within a ±
0.5 min elution window determined from previous HPLC-ESI-MS, CID-MS/MS,
and -MS3 experiments, were selected for dissociation. Characterization
of the peptide sequences and the oxidation or DMBNHS modification
sites were determined by manual interpretation of the MS/MS or MS3 spectra. The program GetArea was used, with all parameters set at default values, to calculate
the solvent accessibilities of lysine amino acid side chains of CN,
based on the reported CN crystal structure.

Data Analysis
Unless indicated otherwise, the relative
abundances of peptide ions were determined from the MS spectra averaged
over the corresponding chromatographic peaks. If multiple charge states
for a precursor ion were observed, then the abundance was calculated
by combining the abundance from all charge states. For peptides with
only one modifiable residue (i.e., either methionine or lysine), the
percent unmodified residue remaining after each reaction condition
was calculated using eq ,where MS(unmodified) indicates
the MS ion abundance of the unmodified peptide and MS(modified) indicates the MS ion abundance of the modified peptide. For peptides
with multiple modifiable residues and whose isomeric-modified forms
were resolved chromatographically, the percent unmodified form of
each residue remaining after each reaction condition was determined
by eq ,where MS(pUnmodified) indicates
the MS ion abundance of a partially modified peptide isomer where
the residue under investigation was unmodified. For peptides with
multiple modifiable residues and whose isomeric-modified forms coeluted
during HPLC separation (this was only observed in the case of some
DMBNHS-modified peptides), the abundance of the partially modified
peptide isomers with different site(s) of modification could not be
determined solely from the MS ion abundance. Therefore, the percent
unmodified form of each residue remaining after each reaction condition
was determined by eq ,where MS(pModified) indicates the
MS ion abundance of partially modified peptide isomers, ∑MS/MS(pUnmodified) is the summed abundances of the characteristic
ETD-MS/MS product ions from a particular modified peptide isomer where
the residue under investigation was unmodified, and ∑MS/MS(pModified) is the summed abundance of the characteristic ETD-MS/MS
product ion abundances from all modified peptide isomers.

For
the methionine oxidation study, the results from triplicate HPLC-ESI-MS
analysis for each reaction were then averaged and used for the determination
of pseudo-first-order methionine oxidation rate constants (kox), as described by Carruthers et al., where kox was determined
from the plots of average percent native methionine residue versus
oxidation time (tox) as ln(native methionine
residue%) = −koxtox. If a methionine residue was observed in multiple digests,
the reported oxidation rate constant was obtained by averaging the
results from the peptides observed in each digest. For the lysine
DMBNHS labeling experiments, the results from triplicate HPLC-ESI-MS
and/or ETD-MS/MS analysis were averaged and used for the determination
of second-order DMBNHS modification rate constants (kDMBNHS). kDMBNHS was determined
as ln(unmodified lysine residue%) = −kDMBNHS(DMBNHS/CN)tDMBNHS from the
plots of average percent unmodified lysine residues versus molar reaction
ratio of DMBNHS over CN. tDMBNHS was a
fixed value at 1800 s.

Results and Discussion
Quantification of the Susceptibility
of Methionine Residues
toward Oxidation
To determine the sensitivity of methionine
residues within CN toward oxidation by H2O2,
CN was incubated with 12 mM H2O2 for 0, 15,
30, 45, 60, 120, and 240 min, digested with Lys-C, trypsin, or Glu-C,
then analyzed in triplicate by capillary HPLC-ESI-MS. The peptides
were identified by their monoisotopic m/z values obtained from the high resolution/accurate mass spectra and
confirmed by CID- and/or ETD-MS/MS analysis in the ion trap. Fifteen
of the total 19 methionine residues were observed. The observed methionine
residues from the corresponding peptides in the three different digests,
compared to the results reported by Carruthers et al., along with the predicted solvent accessibilities
based on the CN crystal structure, are
listed in Table . Note that some of the peptides
observed here from the Lys-C digest are different than those observed
by Carruthers et al. (i.e., some peptides observed by Carruthers et
al. were not observed here, and vice versa). This is likely attributed to differences in the chromatographic
separation conditions used in each study.

Solvent accessibilities were predicted
based on the CN crystal structure from PDB entry 1AUI, using the GetArea program.

The subscript number and
letter
indicate the residue number and the corresponding CN subunit, respectively.

N/A; predicted solvent accessibilities
could not be determined as these residues are not observed in the
CN crystal structure.

It
can be seen from Table  that some peptides
contain two methionine residues. For example, CNA subunit peptides
482A-506A from the Glu-C digest and 475A-501A from the Lys-C digest both contain Met483A and Met490A, while CNB subunit peptide 118B-125B from the Lys-C digest contains both Met118B and Met119B. Thus, two isomeric forms will
exist for the singly oxidized forms of these peptides. Fortunately,
the pairs of singly oxidized isomers for each of these peptides were
chromatographically resolved, and their oxidation sites were determined
by CID- or ETD-MS/MS, thereby allowing the oxidation rate constant
for each methionine residue to be determined. For example, Figure A shows the ETD-MS/MS spectrum of peptide 482A-506A from the Glu-C digest, oxidized at Met490A, while Figure B shows the ETD-MS/MS
spectrum of the same peptide, oxidized at Met483A. In Figure A, the presence of nonoxidized sequence ions c5, c6-1, c7-1, c8-1, z6+1, z7+1, z8+1, z9+1, z10+1, z11+1, z12+1, z13+1,
and z14+1, and oxidized sequence ions c10+O,
c11+O, c12+O, c13+O, c14+O, c15+O, c16+O, [c20+O]2+, [c21+O]2+, [c22+O]2+, [c23+O]2+, z15+O, z17+O+1, z18+O+1, and z19+O+1 readily allowed
localization of the oxidation site to Met490A. Similarly,
the oxidation site in Figure B was readily
localized to Met483A.

Ion trap ETD-MS/MS characterization of
the triply protonated precursor
ion isomers of singly oxidized CNA peptide 482A-506A containing (A) oxidized Met490A and (B) oxidized
Met483A. A “+O” indicates a sequence ion
containing one oxidation site. A superscript * indicates the loss
of NH3. A dashed line in the sequence indicates an unoxidized
sequence ion was observed, while a solid line indicates that a singly
oxidized sequence ion was observed.

Notably, more complete sequence coverage was obtained by
using
ETD compared to CID for these peptides (see ). The lower, but complementary,
sequence coverage obtained by CID-MS/MS was attributed as being due
to the facile loss of methane sulfenic acid (CH3SOH), which
occurs as a dominant process under conditions of low proton mobility
(the +3 precursor ion of the 482A-506A peptide
observed here corresponds to a “nonmobile” protonation
state). In contrast, due to the radical-driven
cleavage mechanism of ETD, the neutral loss of sulfenic acid is not
observed. The oxidation sites for the
isomers of the singly oxidized 475A-501A and
118B-125B peptides were also identified by ETD-
and CID-MS/MS (data not shown). Therefore, the oxidation rates of
all observed methionine residues could be individually quantified.

The fraction of each of the observed methionine residues within
the CN protein complex remaining in its nonoxidized state were then
plotted against oxidation time to calculate the corresponding pseudo-first-order
oxidation rate constants (kox). Two examples
are shown in Figure  for the tryptic peptides
77A-100A (Met99A) and 425A-441A (Met431A). Met431A exhibited
a higher susceptibility toward oxidation compared to Met99A, with calculated kox values of 8.4 ×
10–5 s–1 and 3.0 × 10–6 s–1, respectively. Similar plots
for each of the observed methionine residues from each digest are
shown in . From each of these plots, pseudo-first-order reaction rate constants
were calculated and are shown in Figure ,
as solid labels. The rate constants determined by Carruthers et al. are also included in Figure  for comparison, represented by open labels. On the basis
of these results, methionine residues above an arbitrary threshold
of kox &gt; 2.0 × 10–5 s–1 were considered as being particularly susceptible
to oxidation.

from different digests, the data are reported as the average, with
error bars shown as ± standard deviation.

It can be seen from  that when the same methionine residue
was observed in different digests, they generally underwent similar
extents of oxidation as a function of H2O2 incubation
times. The Lys-C digests showed a slightly higher extent of oxidation,
which may have resulted from a small variance in H2O2 concentration during the sample preparation process for this
particular digest. Nonetheless, the calculated oxidation rate constants
were consistent among the different digests, as evidenced by the error
bars in Figure  that show the standard deviations
when the same methionine residue was observed in peptides from different
digests.

The results obtained using the multienzyme digestion
strategy described
here were generally consistent with those previously reported by Carruthers
et al., except for Met11B and Met44B. These
differences might be due to the variations in conformation between
these two batches of proteins. However, the results obtained in the
current study are quite consistent with the predicted solvent accessibility
(SA) for Met11B of 12.3% and for Met44B of 43.8%
(calculated from the crystal structure of human CN with a free N-terminus).
Furthermore, the N-terminus of the CNB subunit within the CN complex
examined here was myristoylated, and the crystal structure of a bovine
CN protein complex with N-terminal myristoylation of CNB shows that
the extended myristoyl group is laid over the 1B-12B residues. Therefore, the actual
SA of Met11B is expected to be lower than 12.3%, which
supports the low oxidation rate constant determined for this residue.
Generally, the relative susceptibilities of observed methionine residues
determined here show good correlation with the calculated solvent
accessibility based on the known crystal structure. However, it should be noted that Met483A and
Met166B have relatively low calculated solvent accessibility
but showed high sensitivity toward oxidation. These differences might
be a reflection of the different conformations proteins adopt in the
dynamic (i.e., solution) versus static (i.e., crystal) states, as
both Met483A (located in the linker region between the
CaM binding and autoinhibitory domain) and Met166B (located
on CNB C-terminal) reside in flexible regions of the protein based
on the crystal structure.

The oxidation rate constants determined
here are expected to be
dependent upon the native structure of CN. However, conformational
changes resulting from sequential secondary oxidation of the oxidized
CN (discussed later), may also occur. To surmise to what extent the
protein may undergo secondary oxidation, the probability of a protein
being singly oxidized (P(1 ox)) and doubly oxidized
(P(2 ox)) upon being oxidized for 15 min were calculated
using eqs  and , respectively.

In these equations, pi,j is the
probability of a specific methionine residue
being oxidized at the 15 min oxidation time point, determined from
the data in . Four methionine residues located in the catalytic
domain were not observed, and the probability for these to be oxidized
was estimated to be 2.1% by averaging the oxidation probability of
observed methionine residues within the same functional domain. It
was determined that P(1 ox) = 39%, and P(2 ox) = 19%, indicating that while 39% of the protein may experience
secondary oxidation when being incubated in H2O2 for longer than 15 min, only 19% of the protein had undergone secondary
oxidation at the 15 min oxidation time point. Therefore, the oxidation
rate constants determined here may be largely attributed to the oxidation
susceptibility of methionine residues within the native CN structure,
with only minor contribution from oxidized CN.

The observed
CN methionine residues show a wide range in sensitivity
toward oxidation with the lowest kox determined
to be 1.5 × 10–6 s–1 (Met364A) and the highest kox of 9.3
× 10–5 s–1 (Met166B), as shown in Figure , and summarized in
Table . Interestingly, the methionine residues
within the CNA subunit which are highly susceptible to oxidation are
all located in the CN regulatory region which includes the CaM binding
domain (Met406A), the linker region between the CaM binding
and autoinhibitory domains (Met431A), the autoinhibitory
domain (Met483A), and the C-terminal (Met490A). The two oxidation sensitive methionine residues within the CNB
protein subunit are located in the N-terminal CNA binding domain (Met44B) and at the C-terminus (Met166B). Importantly,
Met44B is close to the first Ca2+ binding region
(31B-42B), which is one of the two low-affinity
sites that play an important role in CN activation under elevated
Ca2+ concentrations.−

It has previously been
suggested that oxidation of Met residues
located next to cysteine (Cys) residues within the CNA (Cys178AMet179A and Met227ACys228A) and
CNB (Met11BCys12B) subunits may facilitate the
oxidation of these vicinal Cys residues, thereby resulting in attenuation
of CN-related activities/functions by compromising the structural
integrity of CN., However, no experimental evidence
was provided to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, although Met179A was not observed in the current study, neither Met227A or Met11B was found to be susceptible to oxidation
in the study performed here.

Quantification of Lysine Amino Acid Residue
Solvent Accessibility
by DMBNHS Modification
To determine whether H2O2-induced methionine oxidation resulted in conformational
changes within CN, lysine residues within each of the CN samples oxidized
at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min time points were modified by reaction
with DMBNHS, at DMBNHS/CN molar ratios of 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100.
The labeled CN samples were then digested overnight using Glu-C, as
modification of lysine residues by DMBNHS would result in missed cleavages
at the Lys residue C-termini if trypsin or Lys-C was used. Each digest
was then analyzed in triplicate by capillary HPLC-ESI-MS, CID-MS/MS
and data-dependent constant neutral loss (DDCNL) triggered CID-MS3 or ETD-MS/MS. Using this approach, 23 of the total 45 lysine
residues within CN were observed, as summarized in Table .

could not be determined as these residues are not observed in the
CN crystal structure.

Figure A,B shows the results from reaction
of the native and oxidized (15, 30, 45, and 60 min time points) forms
of CN at different DMBNHS molar ratios, for the CNA peptides 364A-394A (Lys393A) and 395A-416A (Lys399A), respectively. From these data, second-order
DMBNHS modification rate constants (kDMBNHS) were determined
(shown in Table  for the 0 and 15 min oxidation
time points). As evidenced by the increase in the extent of lysine
modification in both peptides as a function of CN oxidation time,
the data in Figure A,B reveal that both Lys393A and Lys399A underwent conformational changes
at the earliest oxidation time point (i.e., 15 min). Longer oxidation
times were not found to cause further changes in the region around
Lys393A (Figure A), whereas Lys399A exhibited further modification with increased oxidation
times (Figure B), which may result from secondary
oxidation-induced conformational changes. The results from all other
observed lysine residues are shown in . These results indicate that
at the 15 min oxidation time point all observed lysine residues exhibited
at least some increased reaction with DMBNHS compared to the native
nonoxidized form, indicating that the protein complex underwent a
global conformational change, or a number of smaller, or more local,
conformational changes, upon oxidation. However, most of the observed
lysine residues did not undergo significant additional modification
with longer oxidation times, indicating that possible secondary oxidation-induced
conformational changes were restricted to discrete regions of the
protein.

following reaction with different molar excesses of DMBNHS. (A) Lys393A from 364A-394A and (B) Lys399A from 395A-416A digested from native CN (⧫)
and CN oxidized for 15 min (■), 30 min (▲), 45 min (▼),
and 60 min (+). All data were run in triplicate and fitted
with a single exponential. Error bars are shown as ± standard
deviation.

Some peptides contained multiple
lysine residues and thus isomeric
DMBNHS-modified peptides were generated. Among these, the isomeric
forms of modified peptides 34A-53A, 394A-416A, 419A-450A, 451A-472A, 457A-472A, 75B-89B, and 153B-170B were
all chromatographically resolved. Thus, the modification sites could
be identified by CID-MS3 or ETD-MS/MS and the DMBNHS modification
rate constants subsequently determined for each individual lysine
residue. However, the isomers of some other modified peptides closely
eluted such that the relative abundances for each isomer could not
be measured based on their MS ion abundances. In these cases, the
relative abundances of the MS/MS fragment ions characteristic for
a given modification site were used to calculate the DMBNHS modification
rate constant. ETD-MS/MS was favored over CID-MS3 here
for quantification purposes, mainly because of the higher sequence
coverage obtained when using the ETD technique. Figure  shows the ETD-MS/MS spectrum of the +5 precursor ion charge
state of the singly modified CNB peptide 90B-111B containing Lys91B and Lys103B, which shows
the coexistence of sequence ions corresponding to DMBNHS modification
at either amino acid residue. The sum of the ETD-MS/MS ion abundances
of all observed fragment ions characteristic of the modification at
Lys103B and those characteristic of the modification at
Lys91B were used together with the summed MS ion abundances
of singly modified 90B-111B to obtain the relative
abundances of unmodified Lys91B and Lys103B,
respectively. The resultant plots used for determination of the second-order
DMBNHS modification rate constants are shown in . Using the
same method, the DMBNHS modification rate constants were individually
quantified for Lys424A and Lys441A from their
coeluting 419A-450A peptides (). However,
due to the low abundance of the singly modified 419A-450A peptide when CN was modified using a low molar excess of
DMBNHS, and subsequently the low abundance of the ETD-MS/MS product
ions, the DMBNHS modification rate constants for these residues were
only calculated from the 20-, 50-, and 100-fold DMBNHS molar excess
reaction conditions. For peptides containing more than two modifiable
sites, such as CNB peptide 19B-42B, containing
Lys21B, Lys25B, Lys28B, and Lys29B, DMBNHS modification rate constants could only be quantified
for the first and last lysine residue within the peptide (i.e., Lys21B and Lys29B). However, as unambiguous characteristic
ETD-MS/MS product ions could not be observed for Lys29B (), the DMBNHS modification rate constant was determined only for
Lys21B. It is important to point out that the rate constants
determined from the abundances of the ETD-MS/MS product ions are not
correlated with the actual extent of DMBNHS modification, as the abundances
of product ions are affected by a variety of factors, including differences
in ionization efficiency and ETD cleavage bias, between the unmodified
and modified peptides. However, the variance in product ion intensities
induced by these factors should be consistent from run to run when
the same peptides are analyzed. Therefore, the fold change in DMBNHS
modification rate constants upon oxidation (see below) can be considered
indicative of the extent of conformational change occurring within
specific regions of the CN protein complex.

It was interesting to notice that the DMBNHS modification
rate
constants for Lys459A and Lys466A determined
from the native CN Glu-C digest peptide 451A-472A (kDMBNHS of Lys459A = 8.9
× 10–7 M–1 s–1 and Lys466A = 1.4 × 10–6 M–1 s–1) were lower than those determined
from the 457A-472A peptide within the same digest
(kDMBNHS of Lys459A = 1.4 ×
10–6 M–1 s–1 and kDMBNHS of Lys466A =
1.7 × 10–6 M–1 s–1). Similar differences were observed between the 451A-472A and 457A-472A peptides from the oxidized
CN protein (Table ). One possible explanation
for this is that the incorporation of the fixed charge sulfonium ion
could enhance enzymatic cleavage when the cleavable site is close
to the modification site. Also, the enhancement of ionization efficiency
caused by the incorporation of the fixed charge is expected to affect
shorter peptides more than longer peptides., However, no apparent difference in DMBNHS modification rate constants
was observed between other peptides, e.g., 364A-394A and 373A-394A, both containing Lys393A. This is expected as DMBNHS modification of Lys393A could only affect the efficiency of the cleavage at the C-terminal
of Glu394A of both peptides. Furthermore, incorporation
of only one fixed charge to this peptide would not be expected to
enhance the ionization efficiency to the same degree as the incorporation
of two fixed charges.

Despite the observed variations in DMBNHS
modification rates caused
by digestion and/or ionization efficiency, the overall fold change
in DMBNHS modification rate constants (described below) used to quantify
conformational changes between the native and oxidized forms of CN
remained consistent among different peptides containing the same lysine
residues. For example, after being oxidized for 15 min, the fold changes
determined for the DMBNHS modification rate constant of Lys459A from peptide 451A-472A and 457A-472A were 1.44 and 1.54-fold, respectively, with a standard
deviation of 0.08.

The extent of CN conformational change upon
oxidation was characterized
by dividing the DMBNHS modification rate constant of each observed
lysine residue from the oxidized (15 min time point) CN protein complex
by the DMBNHS modification rate constant of the same lysine residue
from the native CN protein complex, yielding a fold change indicative
of each lysine residue’s DMBNHS modification rate constant
as a function of oxidation (Figure ). Data
labels in Figure  indicate the percent modification
for each lysine residues that was observed in the native CN protein
complex using a DMBNHS molar excess of 100. When the same lysine residue
was observed from different peptides, the DMBNHS modification rate
constants determined from all observed peptides were averaged and
then used to calculate the fold increase.

Ratio of second-order
DMBNHS modification rate constants determined
for observed lysine residues from oxidized CN (15 min reaction time
point) over the DMBNHS modification rate constants determined for
the corresponding Lys residues from native CN. CN Lys residues located
in the catalytic domain (purple solid circle), CaM binding domain
(green solid box) and autoinhibitory region (orange solid pentagon)
of CNA, the CNA binding region (blue solid up triangle) and Ca2+ binding domain (light blue solid down triangle) of CNB and
nonfunctional regions (⧫). Data labels indicate the percent
modification observed in the native CN protein complex at a DMBNHS
molar excess of 100.

Lysine residues that showed greater than a 2-fold increase
in their
modification rate constants were found to be located in (i) the CaM
binding domain (Lys399A and Lys405A), (ii) the
linker region between CaM binding and AI domains (Lys441A), (iii) the AI domain (Lys474A) of CNA, and (iv) the
Ca2+ binding regions (Lys73B), and (v) the CNA
binding region (Lys91B) of CNB. Thus, similar to the locations
of oxidation sensitive methionine residues, the lysine residues that
showed significant increases in kDMBNHS between the oxidized and native proteins are located in CN domains
involved in Ca2+/CaM binding and stimulation.

Lys91B showed the largest fold increase in kDMBNHS upon
oxidation. Interestingly, in the crystal structure of CN, the ε-amino group of Lys91B is
hydrogen-bonded to the amide carbonyl group of Met166B (Figure A), i.e., the methionine residue that exhibited
the highest susceptibility toward oxidation (see Figure ). Thus, we propose that oxidation of Met166B disrupts
the local hydrogen bonding environment between Met166B and
Lys91B, exposing the ε-amino group of Lys91B to increased DMBNHS modification. Notably, both Met166B and Lys91B are located in the CNA–CNB interface
region. Conformational changes in this area may therefore impair the
interaction between CNA and CNB. It has been reported previously that
CNB binding can also stimulate CN, although to a less extent compared
to CaM. Also, CNB interaction has been
demonstrated to facilitate CaM regulated CN activation., Therefore, perturbed interactions between CNA and CNB may contribute
to the decrease of CN activity upon oxidative modification.

Lys91B and Lys73B are shown as blue sticks,

Ca2+ ions are illustrated as cyan spheres. Residues that
interact with Ca2+ in the Ca2+ binding pockets
are shown as cyan sticks. Hydrogen bonds are illustrated as yellow
dashed lines.

Lys73B also
showed a relatively large fold change in
DMBNHS modification rate constant upon oxidation (2.2-fold increase).
No methionine residues are sequentially or spatially close to Lys73B (Figure B). However, conformational
changes surrounding the Lys73B residue may result from
oxidation of one or several remote methionine residue(s) within the
same region of the protein. One possible remote oxidation site is
Met44B, which was also determined to be highly susceptible
to oxidation (Figure ) in the CNB protein
subunit. Oxidation of Met44B, which is located close to
the first Ca2+ binding pocket (31B-42B), may induce a conformational change in the second Ca2+ binding pocket (63B-74B), which involves Lys73B, as these two Ca2+ binding pockets are hydrogen-bonded
to each other (Figure B). Upon being saturated
with Ca2+, these two N-terminal low-affinity Ca2+ binding sites have been demonstrated to activate CN by direct CNB/CNA
interaction and by facilitating CaM/CNA binding., Therefore,
conformational change in these two Ca2+ binding sites may
cause impaired Ca2+ binding to CNB, which may further inhibit
CNB or/and CaM regulated CN stimulation.

Lys399A and
Lys405A, located within the CaM
binding domain of CNA, also showed greater than 2-fold increases in
their DMBNHS modification rate constants upon CN oxidation. Met406A is directly adjacent to Lys405A, so it is reasonable
to expect that oxidation of this residue (which was determined to
be susceptible toward oxidation; see Figure ), would affect the chemical environment around Lys405A. No methionine residues are close to Lys399A in the CN
sequence. Unfortunately, neither Lys399A nor Lys405A is visible in the known crystal structure of CN, so methionine residues
that are spatially close to these residues in the folded tertiary
structure cannot be determined. Nonetheless, conformational changes
resulting from oxidation, subsequently reflected by increased Lys399A and Lys405A DMBNHS reactivity, that are both
located within the CaM binding domain, may directly impair CN/CaM
binding and inhibit CN activation.

Lys441A, residing
in the linker region between the CaM
binding and AI domains, showed a 2.1-fold increase in kDMBNHS upon oxidation. However, as Lys441A is
also not visible in the known crystal structure of CN, the methionine
residues whose oxidation may cause the conformational change to the
region around this residue cannot be identified. However, oxidation
of Met431A, which is located within the AI domain and has
been determined to be highly susceptible toward oxidation (see Figure ) may induce a conformational change in the sequentially
close region around Lys441A. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
that CaM binding induces extensive folding not only within the CaM
binding domain but also contributes to maintaining the AI domain in
the active configuration.− Therefore, it is plausible to
propose that a structural alteration in the linker region may prohibit
the displacement of AI from the active site upon CaM binding. Also,
it is possible that a conformational change in the CaM binding domain
might induce a perturbation to the linker region between the CaM binding
and the AI domains, and vice versa.

The lysine residue in the
AI domain, Lys474A, also exhibited
a DMBNHS modification rate constant increase greater than 2-fold,
indicating a conformational change within the AI domain upon CN oxidation
that could hinder displacement of the AI domain from the catalytic
site upon Ca2+/CaM binding. Also, CaM binding induced displacement
of the AI domain from the catalytic center involves an extensive conformational
change in the regulatory region ranging from the CaM binding domain
to the AI domain. Therefore, oxidation-induced conformational changes
that occurred within the CaM binding domain and the linker region
between the CaM binding and AI domains may also have a negative effect
on displacement of the AI domain from the catalytic center upon CaM
binding, thereby contributing to CN inactivation. Met483A, located in the AI domain, and Met490A, located close
to the AI domain, both exhibited high susceptibility toward oxidation.
However, it is not clear whether oxidation of these residues was the
cause of conformational change in the region around Lys474A, as no methionine residues observable in the crystal structure of
CN are found to be in direct contact with Lys474A.

Conclusions
Using a novel derivatization reagent and mass spectrometry based
analysis strategy to monitor changes in the covalent modification
rates of lysine residues between native and H2O2-induced oxidized forms of CN, multiple regions within the protein
complex that undergo significant conformational perturbation upon
oxidative modification have been identified. Importantly, both the
methionine residues found to be highly susceptible toward oxidation,
and the lysine residues exhibiting large increases in accessibility
upon oxidation, were all located in calcineurin functional domains
involved in Ca2+/CaM binding regulated calcineurin stimulation.
Therefore, the results obtained in this study provide support for
the hypothesis that H2O2-induced methionine
oxidation results in global and/or localized conformational changes
that contribute to CN inactivation, by impairing the interaction between
CNA and CNB, Ca2+ and CNB, or/and CaM and CNA, or/and by
altering the affinity between AI and the catalytic center.
