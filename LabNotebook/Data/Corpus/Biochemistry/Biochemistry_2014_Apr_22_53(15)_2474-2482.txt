Dehaloperoxidase
isoenzyme A
(DHP A),, first isolated from the terebellid polychaete Amphitrite ornata, is a hemoprotein that appears to function
as both a hemoglobin and a peroxidase. There are two isoforms known
as DHP A and B., Statements true of both isoforms
may simply refer to DHP to mean both DHP A and B. As a hemoglobin,
the heme Fe of DHP A can cycle between the deoxy and oxy state by
reversibly binding with O2, which is used for oxygen storage
and transport. As a peroxidase, DHP A can catalyze the oxidization
of 2,4,6-trihalophenol (2,4,6-TXP) to the corresponding 2,6-dihaloquinone
(2,6-DXQ) (X = I, Br, Cl, F) using H2O2 as a
cosubstrate., Globin function requires a ferrous
heme Fe (Fe2+) to reversibly bind with O2. However,
peroxidase function favors a ferric heme Fe (Fe3+) for
catalytic oxidation of the substrate 2,4,6-TXP in the presence of
H2O2. The mutual exclusivity of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in these two functions leads to a paradox in
DHP function. Recent studies have shown
that DHP can be activated by H2O2 for peroxidase
function starting from the oxyferrous state, which makes DHP a unique
peroxidase-hemoglobin dual functional enzyme., The
observation of an internal substrate binding site by X-ray crystallography, has also helped to resolve the paradox since it suggests that substrate
binding may function as a trigger for the switch from globin to peroxidase
function by its strong interaction with the heme Fe. One can identify
both an electrostatic component, in addition to a steric
effect due to substrate binding., The observation
of a time-resolved X-ray crystal structure is consistent with the
open distal pocket in DHP. The distal
histidine, H55, is clearly involved in the entrance and exit of the
substrate. We have hypothesized that
the unusual flexibility of H55 is linked to its role in the triggering
the functional switch in DHP,, by analogy to the flavohemoglobins. The role of the flexible histidine in functional
switching has an analogy in heme oxygenase-1, which can switch to
a peroxidase function if the distal histidine hydrogen bonding to
heme-bound H2O is disrupted. Another means for introducing functional diversity involves the
conformations of distal glutamate and axial ligation by cysteine,
as observed in chloroperoxidase. Flexibility
can also lead to inactivation by formation of a bis-histidine adduct
with both proximal and distal histidines bound to the heme Fe. This
type of behavior is observed in the W41A mutant of soybean ascorbate
peroxidase. Thus, flexibility is a double-edged
sword, and the competition between enhanced catalytic activity and
inactivation due to six-coordinate heme formation is observed in the
M86A mutant of DHP. The energetic basis
for flexibility of the distal ligand needs to be understood in more
detail if we are to understand multifunctional proteins.

There
are no polar amino acids in the distal pocket of native DHP
aside from H55. In this regard, DHP is different from peroxidases,
which typically have at least one polar amino acid to participate
in activation of bound H2O2.− As consequence,
H55 is the only possible amino acid that can play a role in the heterolytic
bond cleavage of Fe-bound H2O2 during peroxidase
function. Therefore, the communication of the distal pocket with H55
is still a central issue in structural and functional studies of DHP.
In previous studies, two conformations of distal histidine H55 have
been observed identified as external (“open”) and internal
(“closed”) conformation by analogy with similar observations
in sperm whale myoglobin (SWMb)., The role played
by the histidine in DHP is similar to that observed in human Hb as
observed by NMR spectroscopy. Yet, the
conformation of H55 in DHP is strongly affected by the binding of
phenolic substrates and inhibitors,, which is a
unique feature of DHP. The closed conformation is observed when H55
points inside the distal pocket and interacts with the sixth ligand
(i.e., H2O, O2) of heme Fe (PDB 2QFK, 2QFN)., This conformation is similar, but not identical, to Mb, and Hb, structures. The functional relevance of
the histidine in regulating small ligand binding has been a central
feature of studies of both Hbs and Mbs. The bound states can be compared using the π-backbonding
correlation for CO, suggesting that the
weaker hydrogen bonding of the distal histidine with the CO of DHP has similarity with trout Mb. The open conformation refers to H55 rotated to a solvent-exposed
position. This is observed corresponding to a 5-coordinated heme Fe
either in deoxyferrous DHP structure (PDB 3DR9) or when inhibitors 4-XP (X = F, Cl,
Br, and I) (PDB 3LB1, 3LB2, 3LB3, 3LB4) are present in
distal pocket.,, This dynamic motion of the distal histidine has been associated
with entrance and exit of small ligands to and from the distal pocket
by a hypothesis that dates back nearly 50 years and has been extensively studied in the interim by experimental, and computational methods, When residue T56, immediately
adjacent to H55, is mutated to a series of hydrophobic amino acids,
it is evident that this position has a large steric effect on the
flexibility of H55., On the basis of these structures
and spectroscopic data, we have hypothesized that there is a correlation
between the Fe ligation state and the conformation of H55. In 6-coordinated
heme adducts of DHP A, H55 is in the closed conformation where it
can stabilize the sixth ligand by hydrogen bonding. In 5-coordinated
heme adducts of DHP, H55 is in open (solvent exposed) conformation
because there is no sixth ligand available for hydrogen bonding interaction.
To test the validity of the hypothesis for the carbon monoxide form
of DHP A (DHPCO), we have determined the X-ray crystal structure of
three different DHPCO crystals prepared using different methods.

The context for these studies is evident from the extensive studies
of the CO form of SWMb. For the past 50 years, studies of carbonmonoxy
sperm whale myoglobin (SWMbCO) have attempted to explain the discrimination
against CO in normal globin function.,− Free heme has an affinity for CO that is ∼20 000 times
greater than that for O2, while the heme in SWMb has a
ratio of affinities of only ∼25., The two major
factors that have been hypothesized to account for the difference
in the protein are steric interactions and hydrogen bonding.,, For 40 years, it was thought
that CO bound to the heme iron in an unfavorable bent conformation.
Since O2 binds in a bent conformation, the bent form of
CO would have lower binding affinity relative to O2, potentially
be one way to discriminate against CO binding. In the mid-1990s, infrared
dichroism of single crystals revealed that the Fe–C–O
bend angle is essentially 180°, but rather the Fe–C–O
triad had a small tilt of ∼7° from the normal to the heme
plane., The structures showing this nearly upright
structure for the CO molecule were a surprise when they first were
published, because they contradicted an idea that had been in the
literature for nearly 40 years., The structures led
to an alternative hypothesis that the difference in hydrogen bond
strength is the major factor that leads to a stabilization of O2 relative to CO., In SWMb, the interactions
of the distal histidine are not usually viewed as a competition between
the open (external) and closed (internal) conformers, since the H64
is predominantly in the internal site under any but extreme conditions
of pH. However, the nature of the interaction
may be different in DHP because of the greater flexibility of H55
relative to H64 in SWMb. Therefore, the interaction of H55 with CO
molecule will be a key aspect of the X-ray crystallographic structures
of DHPCO. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations
conducted to test the interactions between H55 and heme-bonded CO
or O2 provide us with a quantitative comparison in the
energies of different tautomers of H55 in CO and O2 adducts.− Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a link between
the computational results and X-ray crystal structures by showing
the dynamic consequences of different tautomeric forms of the distal
histidine H55.,,

Materials and Methods
Purification and Crystallization of DHP
The non-6X-His
tagged form of the DHP A protein was expressed, purified, and prepared
in the ferric form as previously described., DHPCO complex crystals were obtained from two different methods.
In the first method, ferric DHP crystals were grown by the hanging-drop
vapor-diffusion method from 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 34% poly(ethylene
glycol) 4000 at 277 K. Crystals were reduced with two different reducing
agents, sodium dithionite (NaS2O6) or dithiothreitol
(DTT), and incubated in a CO atmosphere for 3 h. The corresponding
PDB codes of two crystals obtained from the above method are 4DWT (DHPCO-2, reduced
by NaS2O6) and 4DWU (DHPCO-3, reduced by DTT), respectively.
In the other method, a ferric DHP solution was reduced by 20-fold
excess sodium dithionite first, and crystals were grown by the hanging-drop
vapor-diffusion method from 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 29% poly(ethylene
glycol) 8000 at 277 K in 1 atm CO atmosphere. The corresponding crystal
obtained was assigned to PDB 4GZG (DHPCO-1). The starting protein concentration was
8 mg mL–1 in 10 mM Na cacodylate pH 6.5 buffer for
both methods.

X-ray Data Collection and Structure Refinement
The
DHPCO-1 data set was collected on the 14-BM-C beamline of the APS
synchrotron facility, whereas the DHPCO-3 data set was collected on
the 22-BM beamline. DHPCO-2 data set was collected on the in-house
Rigaku Cu rotating anode X-ray generator RUH3R at NCSU X-ray core
facility. All the data sets were processed using the HKL2000 program
suite. The structure determination and
refinement calculations were performed using the CCP4 suite of programs., Visualization and manual model building were conducted using the
Coot model building software. The carbon
monoxide molecule was placed in the center of the electron density
on top of heme iron as a separated chain, with no other restraints.
Several refinements were conducted to get the best CO geometry and
position in both Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc maps. The final DHPCO-1 (4GZG), DHPCO-2 (4DWT),
and DHPCO-3 (4DWU) structures were refined to R/Rfree values of 17.7/20.9%, 20.8/24.5%, and 17.9/20.2%,
respectively. The DHPCO-1 model contains two polypeptide chains, three
sulfate ions, and 244 water molecules. The DHPCO-2 model contains
two polypeptide chains, five sulfate ions, and 147 water molecules.
The DHPCO-3 model contains two polypeptide chains, five sulfate ions,
and 191 water molecules. The data-collection and model refinement
statistics for the X-ray data sets are summarized in Table .

DHPCO-1 was crystallized from deoxyferrous
DHPA solution in CO atmosphere. DHPCO-2 was prepared by reducing ferric
DHPA crystals in sodium dithionite followed by incubation in CO for
3 h; DHPCO-3 was prepared by reducing ferric DHPA crystals in DTT
followed by incubation in CO for 3 h.

DFT Calculations
DFT calculations were carried out
using the DMol3 program., Geometry optimization
was carried out using the PBE functional and the numerical DNP basis set. Structures were geometry optimized
until the convergence criterion of 10–6 Hartrees
was reached for the energy difference between successive minimization
steps. For these relatively large calculations (208 atoms), the THERMAL
option was used to ensure convergence. This option is based on a grand canonical ensemble approach to electron
occupation. The final energy is obtained by extrapolation to T = 0 K. Calculations were carried out at the high performance
cluster (HPC) at North Carolina State University and using the ARC
computing resource.

The models for DFT used in this study were
composed of truncations of two X-ray crystal structures (PDB 2QFN for DHP-O2 and PDB 4GZG for DHPCO). In model 1, the amino acids used are residues F24, Y34,
H55, T56, E57, K58, V59, and H89. The residues F24 and Y34 are the
two aromatic amino acids nearest to the bound diatomic ligand. Residues
55–59 form an arc surrounding the bound diatomic ligand and
comprise the nearest amino acids on the opposite side to F24 and Y34.
H89 is the proximal histidine, which ligates to the heme Fe atom.
The single amino acids were truncated at the α-carbon, meaning
that the α-carbon is represented by a methyl group, and the
amide N and carbonyl C are converted to hydrogen atoms. The nomenclature
for these models is 2QFN1 and 4GZG1 for the DHP-O2 and
DHPCO structures, respectively. The second model is identical to the
first except that residue 38 was added in both structures. Y38 is
relatively far from the heme Fe atom (i.e., Fe···O
distance is ∼6.2 Å). However, on the basis of previous
crystal structures, Y38 has a potentially strong interaction with
H55 leading to a possible specific role for this amino acid. By performing
two calculations, we have separated this effect. The nomenclature
for the models that include Y38 is 2QFN2 and 4GZG2 for the DHP-O2 and DHPCO structures, respectively. In addition, a calculation
was conducted in which the O2 in the 2QFN structure was
replaced by CO. This was a control calculation to ensure that the
starting point of the calculation (obtained from the X-ray crystal
structure) did not bias the result in terms of either energy or structure.

The α-carbons were fixed in the DFT calculation, but all
other atoms were free to geometry optimize. Since the collected atoms
are normally constrained by the protein, it was reasoned that fixing
the α-carbons would serve as an analogous constraint for the
positions of the amino acids relative to the heme Fe. The coordinates
for the smaller model and the numbers of the fixed atoms are given
in the . The geometry
optimization was carried out based on Cartesian coordinates. Use of
redundant coordinates, which is recommended for many calculations,
fails for the large system used here since they oscillate near the
minimum and do not converge. The final structures were visualized
in VMD by conversion of output files to PDB format. These outputs
and the input files and fixed atoms are provided in the .

MD Simulations
To determine whether there is any tendency
for the distal histidine to fluctuate to the open position when CO
is bound to the heme Fe, models were constructed of DHP A based on
the PDB 4GZG X-ray crystal structure. These models solvated and placed in a unit
cell of dimensions 57.8 Å × 64.1 Å × 48.8 Å
with 9254 water molecules. DHP has one negative charge which was compensated
by a sodium atom. The visualization and setup of the MD simulation
were carried out using the graphical user interface VMD. The DHP monomer models were geometry optimized
using NAMD with the CHARMM27 force field., The parameters for the heme were modified to include the CO bonded
to the heme Fe. The charges for the CO and Fe in this model were modified
based on a DFT calculation using the electrostatic potential fitting
(ESP) option in DMol3. (Accelrys, Inc.). A molecular dynamics simulation
was run for 50 ns using NAMD with the following parameters: time step
of 2 fs (SHAKE algorithm implemented), temperature of 298 K with Langevin
damping, cutoff distance of 12 Å with a 1.0 Å switching
distance. The simulation was run for two modifications of the structure,
one with the δ-tautomer and one with the ε-tautomer of
the distal histidine (H55). It was essential to carry out two parallel
simulations since the tautomeric state of H55 is fixed for a given
structure. The amino acids are designated HSD and HSE for the δ-
and ε-tautomer, respectively.

Results
X-ray Crystallographic
Structures of DHPCO
Figure  shows
the electron density of H55 in both chain
A and B in DHPCO-1 (PDB 4GZG). H55 is primarily in the external position when CO
is bound to heme Fe. The occupancy of CO is 1.0 and the occupancies
of external and internal H55 are 90% and 10%, respectively, in both
chains. The percentages are based on occupancies of CO found from
the Fo – Fc omit map. Although the density for the internal conformation
appears to be incomplete (based on the 2Fo – Fc view at a cutoff of 1.5σ)
shown in Figure , the density does not fit
well to an internal H2O molecule and indeed has the appearance
of a histidine when a cutoff of 0.5σ is used (see ). On the basis
of the average distances in the structures, the distance from the
H55 Ne to the O atom of bound CO is &gt;10.0 Å and ∼3.65
± 0.16 Å for the external (90%) and internal (10%) conformations,
respectively. DHPCO-2 (PDB 4DWT) and DHPCO-3 (PDB 4DWU) are highly similar to DHPCO-1 (see ). The
occupancies of distal histidine and CO and geometries of bound CO
of these three different DHPCO crystals are summarized in Table . The similarity in the observed structures suggests
that the DHPCO structure is independent of preparation methods and
the reducing agent used in the experiment. The CO appears to have
a slightly bent geometry when bound to the heme Fe with C–O
angles ranging from 31° to 11° from the heme normal (Table ). The structures in this study are at lower resolution
compared to the most recent high resolution structures in SWMb where
the angle of the Fe–C–O was determined to be a tilt
that was 7°. We attribute the larger
Fe–C–O angle to the lower resolution of these structures
relative to the very high resolution SWMbCO structures., Figure  shows the overall structure of DHPCO-1
(Figure A) and a detailed structure of heme
and distal histidine H55 (Figure B). Only
the dominant (external) conformation of H55 is shown in both 2A and
2B. Figure B shows that the distances between
the Nε of external H55 and the two propionate groups
of the heme are 3.82 ± 0.03 Å (propionate 7) and 2.73 ±
0.03 Å (propionate 6) in subunit A. The distances in the B subunit
are 3.76 ± 0.08 Å (propionate 7) and 3.21 ± 0.03 Å
(propionate 6). These observations indicate that a hydrogen bonding
interaction between Nε of H55 and the heme propionate
(position 6) is an important factor stabilizing the external conformation
of H55.

The 2Fo – Fc electron density map of the distal pocket in Chain A
in DHPCO-1 (PDB 4GZG) is shown. The occupancy of external H55 and internal H55 is 90%
and 10% respectively in both Chains A and B, although only Chain A
is shown. The cutoff used in this figure is 1.5σ.

The overall structure of DHPCO-1 (Chain B) is shown on
left (A);
the interaction between two heme propionate groups and external H55
is shown on right, and the distances between Nδ and
two propionates (positions 6 and 7) are 2.73 and 3.82 Å (B).
Only the majority conformation of H55 (external) is shown.

DFT Calculations and MD
Simulations
The geometry optimized
structures obtained from DFT calculations conducted on a model containing
208 atoms based on the X-ray crystal structures for DHPCO (PDB 4GZG) and DHP-O2 (PDB 2QFN)
are shown in . The energies of the corresponding structures are given in Table . The energy for the ε-tautomer relative to
the δ-tautomer is lower for the O2 structures than
for the CO structures. This corresponds to a stronger hydrogen bond
formed between the histidine N–H and the bound diatomic O2 molecule than for the CO molecule. The competing interaction
for the histidine (still in the internal position in these structures)
results from the hydrogen bonding interaction with heme propionate
groups. We have selected only the internal (closed) conformation of
H55 in the PDB 4GZG structure for modeling using DFT geometry optimization. The fact
that H55 migrates slightly toward the propionate side chain in the
ε-tautomer is a consequence of the hydrogen bonding interaction
calculated using DFT.

The results of two 50 ns simulations for
the ε- and δ-tautomers of DHP A are shown in Figure , panels A and B, respectively, in terms of the
distances between the N atoms of H55 and the heme Fe atom. The Fe–Nδ and Fe–Nε distances are essentially
constant for the ε-tautomer shown in Figure A, in which H55 remains in the closed conformation throughout
the simulation. H55 is locked in place by a weak, but attractive interaction
between the N–Hδ/ε of H55 and bound
CO. The distance of 4.58 ± 0.20 Å and 6.25 ± 0.26 Å
for the Nε and Nδ atoms with respect
to the Fe atom indicates that H55 is in proximity to the CO in a manner
that is evident from the DFT calculations discussed above (see ). On the other
hand, the simulation for the δ-tautomer of H55 shows a much
greater flexibility of H55, which is consistent with two conformations
(Figure B). The same conclusion is reached
if the Cα–Cβ–Cγ–Nδ dihedral angle is plotted
(see ).
These positions of H55 in these conformations correspond well to the
two conformations of H55 observed in several X-ray crystal structures.,,,, The MD simulation suggests an approximately
equal population of each conformer.

The distance from the Fe atom to the δ-
and ε-N atoms
of H55 is shown as a function of the simulation time for a MD simulation.

Discussion
Structural
Evidence for Flexibility of the Distal Histidine
in DHP A
The flexibility of the distal histidine, H55, in
DHP has been the subject of numerous studies.,,,, On the basis of different X-ray crystal structures
obtained at 100 K, we have hypothesized that there is a correlation
between the ligation state of heme Fe and the conformation of H55.
For example, H55 is observed in the internal conformation in metaquo
(2QFK), metacyano (3KUN), and oxyferrous (2QFN) structures when heme
Fe coordinates with H2O, CN–, and O2 as the sixth ligand, respectively., H55 possesses an external conformation in the deoxyferrous (3DR9)
structure, in which heme Fe is 5-coordinate. Additionally, H55 is observed in the external position when inhibitors
such as 4-XPs (X = I, Br, Cl, and F) are present in ferric DHP A (3LB1,
3LB2, 3LB3, 3LB4). In these structures, the various 4-XPs are located
in the distal pocket of DHP, expel the water molecule, and result
in a 5-coordinated heme Fe. The correlation
between 6-coordinate ligation state of the heme Fe and the internal
conformation of H55 has been corroborated by resonance Raman and EPR
spectroscopies.,,

The observation of an external conformation for H55 in the
DHPCO structure is surprising in the context of the structural correlation
observed in a series of X-ray crystal structures (e.g., 2QFK, 2QFN,
3KUN, 3DR9, 3LB1, 3LB2, 3LB3, and 3LB4).,,,, The DHPCO structure provides the first example in
which the distal histidine H55 is primarily in the external position
in a 6-coordinated DHP structure. The observation of CO in an external
conformation under the conditions used here (pH 6) is also unique
among globins generally, since all other globin structures (with one
exception) show the distal histidine
in an internal conformation. The only X-ray crystal structure in SWMbCO
which shows the external H55 conformation was obtained at pH 4.

Role of Hydrogen Bonding in Stabilizing the
Distal Histidine
Conformation
In 6-coordinate DHP structures obtained previously
(metaquo, metacyano, and oxyferrous DHP), the internal conformation
of H55 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to the sixth ligand (H2O, CN–, and O2, respectively)
of the heme Fe., The neutron diffraction structure
of oxyferrous SWMbO2 shows a hydrogen bond between distal
histidine and heme bound O2 based on the deuterium signal. However, there is no deuterium signal in the
corresponding position in the SWMbCO neutron diffraction structure,
which suggests that there is no hydrogen bond formed between heme
bound CO and the distal histidine. Calculations
support the observed difference, since the hydrogen bond energy of
the distal histidine with either CO or O2 was calculated
to be 8 or 32 kJ/mol, respectively. We
propose that the weakness of hydrogen bonding between heme bound CO
and H55 permits H55 to rotate into the external conformation where
it can hydrogen bond strongly with heme propionate 6 with distances
of 2.73 and 3.21 Å in the A subunit and B subunit, respectively.

Hydrogen bonding between CO and H55 in DHPCO is likely to be even
weaker than in SWMbCO. The heme moiety is located 1.5 Å deeper
in DHP A than in SWMb, and the distal histidine is in the same orientation
but 1.2 Å further away from heme iron than in SWMb.,, On the basis of the comparison
in Table , it is reasonable to estimate that
the hydrogen bond energy between CO and Fe, if it exists at all, in
DHP A is weaker than in SWMb. The DFT calculations carried out here
corroborate this and show that the distances between the O atom of
CO and the Nε atom of H55 is greater than for O2. An interaction between H55 and the heme propionate (position
6) is shown in Figure B and in Table . The short distances between the Nδ of H55 and the O atom of the heme propionate in DHPCO models provide
an indication of the competing attraction of the heme propionates.
The specific interaction with the propionate side chain appears stronger
in this structure than in any corresponding structure of SWMbCO. The
fact that H55 can interact in this way with the heme propionate(s)
is consistent with a shift in the equilibrium toward the solvent-exposed
external conformation. However, the flexibility of H55 appears to
be greater than for the distal histidine in SWMbCO, which implies
that the interaction with the propionate(s) is not the only factor
governing the shift in equilibrium toward the solvent-exposed conformation.

Use of DFT Calculations
To Estimate the Energy of Hydrogen Bonding
DFT calculations
were used to understand the effect of the internal
and external conformations on the tautomeric state of H55. The DFT
geometry optimizations showed that the hydrogen bond of H55 with CO
is sufficiently weak that hydrogen bonding by the δ-tautomer
dominates (Table ). However, in the two O2 structures studied, the hydrogen
bonding of H55 with O2 correlates with the ε-tautomer
(PDB 2QFN).
The DFT calculations are consistent with the observed CO stretching
band in DHPCO at 1950 cm–1, which indicates a weaker
interaction with distal histidine than that observed in SWMbCO, which
has a dominant band at ν(CO) = 1943 cm–1.,

Relationship
to Time-Resolved DHPCO X-ray Crystal Structures
The structures
presented here were essential for an understanding
of the time-resolved X-ray structural data. The time-resolved X-ray structure provided the insight that photolyzed
CO in DHP A migrates immediately to the Xe1 binding site. Moreover, there is evidence for CO escape from
the protein during the time course of the time-resolved X-ray experiment. This trajectory is quite different from those
observed in sperm whale myoglobin, and Scapharca inequivalvis hemoglobin, time-resolved X-ray crystal structures, where the motion of the
CO is dominated by a migration to various internal Xe-binding sites
after a residence in an initial docking site. There is no evidence
for CO escape in either of those structures. We have noted previously
in kinetic studies that CO escape is much more facile in DHP A,, which is consistent with the open conformation observed in the X-ray
structures in this study.

Conclusion
The
X-ray crystallographic structure of the DHPCO adduct provides
insight into the competition between internal and external conformations
of the distal histidine H55. We are compelled to modify our original
model that exclusively correlates the internal and external conformations
of H55 with 6- and 5-coordinate heme Fe, respectively. Contrary to
this model, H55 is primarily observed in the solvent-exposed conformation
in DHPCO, despite the fact that the heme Fe is 6-coordinated. The
interaction of H55 with bound CO is quite weak in DHP due to the greater
distance of the distal histidine from the heme Fe relative to other
globins. Hydrogen bonding of the δ-tautomer of H55 with heme
propionate 6 successfully competes with the Fe-bound CO. The weak
interaction of H55 with bound CO is corroborated by both quantum mechanical
and classical modeling to understand the energetics and dynamics,
respectively. Thus, the modified model suggests that the origin of
the flexibility of H55 in DHP can be found in the unique conformation
of the heme, which is more deeply buried in the globin than in other
myoglobins and hemoglobins. The proximity of H55 to heme propionate
6 shifts the equilibrium of the distal histidine toward the open conformation.
