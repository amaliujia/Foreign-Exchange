Membrane fusion, the merger
of two separate lipid bilayers, is involved in many fundamental cellular
processes and entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. Cellular
membrane fusion is mediated by the SNARE family members, while viral
membrane fusion is accomplished by three classes of viral fusion proteins.
Class I is represented by influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), Ebola
virus GP1/GP2, and human immunodeficiency virus-1 gp120/gp41. Class
II is exemplified by dengue and yellow fever virus glycoprotein E
and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G. Class III includes
herpes simplex virus-1 gB protein.− Recent studies have revealed a common mechanism
by which cellular
and viral fusion proteins catalyze membrane fusion through the formation
of hairpin structures at the postfusion state.− This is achieved via the zipping together of t-SNARE
and v-SNARE
molecules or large-scale conformational changes of viral fusion proteins.
The conformational changes of viral fusion proteins are triggered
by either low pH or receptor binding.−

Influenza type A virus HA has long served as a paradigm for
mechanistic
studies of protein-mediated membrane fusion.− HA is initially
synthesized as a single polypeptide chain (HA0) and forms
a stable homotrimer that is anchored on the envelope of the virus
by a type I transmembrane
domain located at the extreme C-terminus. Its cleavage by intracellular
proteases gives rise to a prefusion state HA containing disulfide-bonded
HA1 and HA2. This cleavage of HA0 is essential for viral infectivity
and pathogenicity.,,− HA mutants with elevated pH values for membrane fusion have been
mapped exclusively to (a) HA1–HA1 interfaces,
(b) HA1–HA2 interfaces, (c) the fusion
peptide and its surrounding region, and (d) the region around the
B-loop, suggesting that these regions are involved in structural rearrangements
of HA in the transition from the prefusion state to the postfusion
state.−

The crystal structures of influenza A/H3N2
virus HA in uncleaved
precursor (HA0), cleaved prefusion
(HA), and postfusion (HA2), states have shed a great deal
of light on the molecular mechanism of HA-mediated membrane fusion.
Comparison of the structures of precursor HA0 and cleaved
prefusion
HA has revealed how the burial of the fusion peptide at the extreme
N-terminus of HA2 in a negatively charged cavity formed
by His-17 of HA1 and Asp-109 and Asp-112 of HA2 primes the molecule for low-pH-induced conformational changes. Indeed, a recent study using single influenza
virions
has revealed that the exposure of the buried fusion peptide is a rate-limiting
step toward hemifusion. In addition,
structural comparison of prefusion HA and postfusion HA2 has uncovered the extent of the conformational changes
between these two different states. However, the molecular forces
that underlie such large-scale conformational changes remain poorly
understood.

The success of the clinical drug T-20 in treating
HIV-1 patients clearly demonstrated that
inhibitors of fusion
can be an effective antiviral strategy. This strategy is especially
valid given the highly conserved nature of the membrane fusion mechanism
across different viruses. Indeed, the stem region of influenza virus
HA, which contains the N- and C-terminal fragments of HA1 and the full-length HA2 and is the actual membrane fusion
agent, is the most conserved region in terms of structures and functions. Antibodies that recognize this stem region were
found
to have broad neutralization activities across different types and
subtypes of influenza virus.− An in-depth understanding of
the structural basis of
the HA-mediated membrane fusion mechanism, in particular the initiation,
sequential events, and intermediates of the structural rearrangements,
will undoubtedly expedite the discovery and development of novel anti-influenza
fusion inhibitors.

Influenza B virus
is another major member of the Orthomyxoviridae
family and, together with influenza A virus subtypes H1N1, H2N2, and
H3N2, is responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics. Influenza B
virus HA shares very low levels of protein sequence identity with
influenza A virus HA, at only ∼20% for HA1 and ∼29%
for HA2 residues 31–181. We have determined a number
of crystal structures of influenza B
virus HA that provide significant insights into the evolution, receptor
binding, and antigenicity of this protein.− Here, we report
the determination of the crystal structure
of influenza B virus HA2 in the postfusion state (Table ). Systematic structural comparison
of known influenza A and B virus HA in prefusion and postfusion states
has revealed critical new insights into the molecular basis
for the conformational changes upon exposure to low pH.

Materials
and Methods
Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Structural Determination
HA2 residues 31–181 of influenza B/Yamagata/73
were cloned into vector pET-45b with
an N-terminal six-histidine tag and expressed in Escherichia
coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Expressed HA2 was purified using cobalt resin (Thermo Scientific) and size-exclusion
chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare). Purified HA2 was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.6), and
crystals were grown at 290 K by the hanging drop method in a reservoir
solution of 0.1 M ammonium citrate and 13.5% PEG 3350 (pH 7.0). The
diffraction data were collected using the 14-BMC beamline (BioCARs)
at the Advanced Photon Source (Chicago, IL), indexed and integrated
by using MOSFLM,, scaled by SCALA, and truncated
to structure factor amplitude by TRUNCATE
in CCP4. Five percent of unique reflections
omitted from refinement
were used as the test set for calculating the Rfree values.

The long helix from the postfusion structure
of influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2 [Protein Data
Bank (PDB) entry 1QU1], including residues 37–105,
was pruned to Cβ atoms by CHAINSAW in the CCP4 suite
and served as the search model for molecular replacement by the AutoMR
module implemented in PHENIX. There is
one polypeptide chain of HA2 in
the asymmetric unit. The biological HA2 trimer was generated
by symmetry operation. The resulting σ-weighted 2Fo – Fc map showed clear
densities for the rest of the protein that were built into the density
by COOT. The model was refined by REFMAC5 in CCP4 or the Refinement module in PHENIX. Figures for structural snapshots were generated
by using
Pymol.

Results
Overall Structure of Influenza
B Virus HA2
The level of sequence identity between
influenza A/H3N2 and B virus
HA2 is only ∼29% as calculated by ClustalW2 (Figure a). The N-terminal region containing part
of the N-cap and region A is the most conserved between them, while
the most variable regions are region B and the C-terminal fragment
(Figure a). However, both types of HA2 fold into
the same hairpinlike structures (Figure b).
The N-cap domain (residues 31–37) stops the extension of the
central three-helix coiled coil (Figure b).
The central three-helix coiled coil is
assembled from three segments: helix A (residues 38–55) that
is a short α-helix in the prefusion state, helix B (residues
56–75)
that is converted from a loop in the prefusion state, and helix C
(residues 76–105) that is part of the long helix in the prefusion
state (Figure c). This long central helix
is followed by
loop D (residues 106–111) that is unfolded from part of the
long central helix in the prefusion state (Figure c). Following this loop is helix E (residues 112–125)
that is packed against the long central helix in an antiparallel orientation,
forming a six-helix bundle (Figure b,c). Loop
F (residues 126–145) and helix G (residues 146–153)
have relatively weaker electron densities and higher B factors, suggesting greater structural flexibility. Consistent with
this observation, for the reported influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2 structure (PDB entry 1QU1) where there are two trimers in the asymmetric unit,
this region displays different conformations, including α-helix,
β-sheet, or random coil, in different chains. The C-terminal fragment (residues 154–181) runs
along the groove between the two neighboring central helices
and interacts with the N-cap domain at one extreme end of the molecule
(Figure b).

(d) Comparison of the helical propensity of influenza A/H3N2 and B

As the α-helical conformation predominates
the postfusion structure, we also analyzed the helical propensity
of influenza
A/H3N2 and B virus HA2 in the region of residues 31–160
using COILS/PCOILS (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/pcoils) (Figure d). In comparison to influenza
A/H3N2 virus
HA2, influenza B virus HA2 clearly has a higher
helical propensity in regions A and D and a lower propensity in regions
E and F and exhibits a sharp dip in helical propensity in region B.
This is in agreement with the observations that loop F did display
a helical conformation in some of the chains in the influenza A/H3N2
virus HA2 structure.

Protein
Core
For the central three-helix coiled coil
in the postfusion structures, helices A and C can be superimposed
very well between
influenza A/H3N2 and B virus HA2; however, relatively larger
deviations are observed in helix B (Figure a,c). This is consistent with the fact that
region B is one of the most variable regions in sequence (Figure a). Among those constituting the protein
core, the residues are either identical (in helix A and the N- and
C-termini of helix C) or highly conserved in hydrophobicity (individually
or in pairs in helix B and the middle section of helix C) (Figure b). The only exception is the buried Glu-59
in influenza B virus HA2 where the corresponding residue
is Thr-59 in influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2. The side chain
of Glu-59 points toward the 3-fold axis and is surrounded by the hydrophilic
residue Asn-62 and two
large hydrophobic residues Leu-63 and Leu-164 (Figure d). It has been shown in Marburg virus glycoprotein
GP2 that buried Glu residues result in a higher stability at low pH,
leading to a hypothesis that these residues are strategically placed
in sequence to favor the formation of the postfusion structure at
low pH., For influenza B virus HA2, we
also observed a similar
stabilization effect at low pH, with approximate Tm values of 42 °C at pH 7.2 and 60 °C at pH
5.2 (Figure e).

residues on HA2 will be mentioned in the format of, for

specifically indicated as, for instance, HA1 His-17. (c)

Panels a–c use the same coloring scheme as Figure a.

N-Cap Domain
In influenza B virus HA2, N-terminal
residues 34–37 cap the central three-helix coiled coil (Figure a). The side chains from the highly conserved
Asp-37 form hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide groups of residues
Leu-38 and Ser-40 of the same subunit (Figure a). In addition, the carbonyl group of Asp-37
contributes two hydrogen bonds, one with the amide group on the main
chain and the other with the hydroxyl group on the side chain of Thr-41
(Figure a).

N-Cap domain. (a) Interaction network
of the N-cap domain
in influenza
B virus HA2. Hydrogen bonds are shown as yellow dashed
lines. (b) Interaction network of the N-cap domain in influenza A/H3N2
virus HA2. The hydrogen bonds that are also observed in
influenza B virus HA2 are shown as yellow dashed lines,
while those unique to influenza A/H3N2 HA2 are highlighted
as orange dashed lines. The three subunits of the trimer are differently
colored.

As the region of residues 34–37
extends toward a neighboring subunit, one hydrogen bond is observed
between the carbonyl group of Val-34 and the amide group of Leu-38.
In addition, the three N-caps interact with each other around the
3-fold
axis of the molecule by forming two layers of hydrophobic interactions,
among three Ala-36 residues and among three Ala-35 residues, and making
three hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl group of Ala-36 and the
amide group of the same residue on the neighboring subunit (Figure a). The N-cap also interacts with the C-terminal
fragment by forming one hydrogen bond between the amide group of Asp-37
and the carbonyl group of Thr-174 (Figure a). Collectively, these interactions stabilize
the N-cap domain and stop the central coiled coil structure from extending
further.

In influenza A/H3N2 HA2, although most of
the interactions
are similarly observed, a large discrepancy is seen between the N-cap
domain and the C-terminal fragment (Figure b). In particular, the hydrogen bonding
interactions between the main chain atoms of Ala-35 and Val-176 (the
carbonyl of Ala-35 and the amide of Val-176, and the amide of Ala-35
and the carbonyl of Val-176) and between the hydroxyl of Ser-40 and
the amide of Lys-174 as observed in influenza A/H3N2 HA2 are all absent in influenza B virus HA2 (Figure b, highlighted as orange dashed lines).

Interactions
between the Central Helices and the C-Terminal
Fragment
The packing of the C-terminal fragment into the
groove formed by neighboring central helices brings the C-terminal
transmembrane domain and the N-terminal fusion peptide into the proximity
of each other to promote fusion of the viral envelope and the endosomal
membrane to which they each attach. We used InterProSurf (http://curie.utmb.edu/prosurf.html) to calculate the total surface area that is buried between the
C-terminal fragment and the central helices in the postfusion structures
of influenza A/H3N2 and B virus HA2. We found
that influenza B virus HA2 has a total buried surface area
of 2315.5 Å2, which is a bit smaller than the interface
in influenza
A/H3N2 virus HA2 (at 2550.1 Å2). The interface
in influenza B virus HA2 is
predominantly hydrophobic, containing a polar area of 591.6 Å2 and an apolar area of 1723.9 Å2 from several
large hydrophobic residues such as Phe-157,
Phe-162, Leu-164, Phe-167, Leu-171, and Ile-173. In contrast, influenza
A/H3N2 HA2 contains four hydrophobic residues, Tyr-157,
Tyr-162, Phe-171, and Ile-173, and has polar and apolar interface
areas of 1020.3 and 1529.8 Å2, respectively. Thus,
the polar interface between the
central helices and C-terminal fragment in influenza A/H3N2 HA2 is almost twice as large as that of influenza B virus HA2. Via comparison to the &gt;20 polar interactions in this
region
of influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2, there are only seven such
interactions in influenza B virus HA2 (Figure a,b)

Interactions between the central helices and the C-terminal
fragment.

three ionic clusters that are absent in influenza B virus HA.

The abundant polar interactions
in influenza
A/H3N2 virus HA2 urged us to carefully inspect its prefusion
structure (PDB entry 3HMG). This revealed three clusters of ionic
residues formed between the
C-terminal fragment and its surrounding residues (Figure c). One such cluster is near the fusion
peptide (in an orange box) formed by residues Glu-150 and Arg-153
with His-26. Another cluster is among Arg-170 on the C-terminal fragment
and Glu-128 and Glu-131 on loop F (in the red box). The third cluster
is among residues Asp-158, His-159, and Asp-160 on the C-terminal
fragment and residues Arg-127 and Asn-129 on the other side of loop
F (in the green box). These ionic clusters are located at regions
that are to be separated during the low-pH-mediated large-scale conformational
changes of HA. Similar ionic clusters are not found in the prefusion
structure of influenza B virus HA.

Six-Helix Bundle
The six-helix bundle at the postfusion state results from a helix-to-turn
transition in region D followed
by the antiparallel packing of helix E against helix C. The formation
of this six-helix
bundle of HA is required for the formation of the hemifusion state., In influenza B virus HA2, Ile-107 closely packs toward
the 3-fold symmetry axis to form a tight hydrophobic core, while the
next residue,
Ile-108, almost sits in the middle of two adjacent helices C. The
carboxyl group of Glu-105 at the C-terminus of helix C interacts with
the backbone atoms of Asn-109, Ser-110, and Glu-111 in loop D from
the neighboring subunit, stabilizing this arrangement by three hydrogen
bonds (Figure a).

A/H3N2 virus HA2. (c) Interactions between helix C and
helix E in influenza B virus HA2. (d) Interactions between
helix C and helix E in influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2.

In influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2, Thr-107
residues form an annulus that covers the C-terminus of the coiled
coil (Figure b). The hydroxyl groups of three
Thr-107
residues form hydrogen bonds with either the carbonyl oxygen atom
of Thr-107 from a neighboring subunit or the side chain of Gln-105.
In comparison with that of influenza B virus HA2, the C-terminus
of loop D in influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2 moves farther from
the central helices (Figure b).

The
stacking orientation of helix E on the groove of two neighboring
central helices C is also different in influenza A/H3N2 and B virus
HA2. Helix E is straight in influenza B virus HA2 but is slightly bent in influenza A/H3N2 HA2 (Figure c,d). Structurally, this bending could be
the result of the side chain packing at the interface of helix C and
helix E. In influenza B virus HA2, the residues from the
central helices that form the interhelical groove are smaller (Ile-92,
Ser-94, and Ala-99), making a concave
surface in this region. Therefore, the side chains of the hydrophobic
residues (Leu-115, Leu-118, Leu-122, and Leu-126) in helix E pack
snugly against this concave surface (Figure c). In marked contrast, the interhelical groove where helix E packs
in influenza A/H3N2 virus HA2 is flat because of three
large residues (Trp-92, Tyr-94, and Leu-99),
and the residues on helix E (Met-115, Leu-118, Thr-122, and Leu-126)
have to pack slightly sideways against this groove (Figure d).

Comparisons of the Structures in the Prefusion
State
To gain more insight into the structural basis of
HA-mediated membrane fusion, we further compared the prefusion structures
of influenza A (H1–H3, H5, H7, H9, H13, H14, and
H17) and B virus HA. When viewing from the membrane distal end of
the HA molecules, we found that the HA1 monomers are much
closer to each other in influenza B virus HA than in influenza A virus
HA (Figure a,b). Although group 1 and group
2 HA proteins
of influenza A virus differ in the orientation of their receptor-binding
(R) domains relative to those of influenza B virus HA (Table ), their total HA1–HA1 interface area is constantly smaller and the B-loop more exposed
than that in influenza B virus HA (Table ).

The R domain (HA1 residues
115–261) of different influenza A virus HAs was superposed
with that of influenza B virus HA by the Dalilite server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/structure/dalilite/). The HA2 domains were aligned at HA2 residues
37–55 and HA2 residues 76–110. The orientation
of the R domain was calculated by the Dyndomain server (http://fizz.cmp.uea.ac.uk/dyndom/).

The solvent accessible
surface area
(SASA) was analyzed by using InterProSurf server (http://curie.utmb.edu/prosurf.html). The HA1–HA1 interface area was calculated
by the formula SASA(three monomeric HA1) – SASA(trimeric
HA1).

The cavity
was found by the 3V server
(http://3vee.molmovdb.org/). The default value for the
outer probe radius (10 Å) was used for calculating the cavity
size for influenza A virus HAs. For influenza B virus HA, the default
value did not reveal any internal cavity. The reported internal cavity
of 485 Å3 was found using an outer probe radius of
5 Å.

The surface area
was calculated
by Areaimol in CCP4.

The
large differences in the HA1–HA1 interface
between influenza A and B virus
HA prompted us to investigate the presence of internal cavities in
these structures. Using the default outer probe radius of 10 Å
in the 3V server (http://3vee.molmovdb.org/), we could
not detect
any internal cavity in influenza B virus HA. A small cavity of 485
Å3 was located when we used a much smaller probe radius
(5 Å) (Figure c and Table ). This
cavity is almost isolated from aqueous solution. Strikingly, by using
the default value of 10 Å in all known structures of influenza
A virus HA proteins, we constantly
found a large internal cavity that is beneath the HA1 subunits,
and just atop the C-terminus of the B-loop (Figure d and Table ). These
internal cavities are directly connected to the outside aqueous solution,
indicating that protons could more easily diffuse into the interior
of influenza A virus HA molecules than into influenza B virus HA.

The fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA2 in known
structures of influenza B virus HA,, is very different from that of influenza A virus
HA. In influenza B virus HA, the fusion peptide points away from its
own helix A and helix B to interact with those of a neighboring subunit
via residues Phe-2 and Phe-3 (Figure e). The
residues that surround the 3-fold axis of the molecule become Glu-113.
The fusion peptide also adopts
a lower position (toward the viral membrane) in the structure, thus
losing most of the polar interactions with Asn-109 and Asp-112 (Figure g). In previous studies, it has been shown
that compromised interactions between the fusion peptide and Asp-112
destabilized the protein, increased the fusion pH, and accelerated
the kinetics of membrane fusion.,, In sharp contrast, the fusion peptide of influenza
A virus HA is
located near the 3-fold symmetry axis of the molecule and forms a
network of hydrophobic
interactions at residues Leu-2 and Phe-3 (Figure f). In addition, the fusion peptide makes
a total of six hydrogen bonds with Asp-112 and one hydrogen bond with
Asp-109 (Figure h). Overall, the fusion peptide
and its
interacting residues are more exposed in influenza B virus HA than
in influenza A virus HA.

Discussion
Influenza A and B virus HA proteins belong to class I of the viral
fusion proteins. Prior studies of the prefusion and postfusion structures
of influenza A/H3N2 HA have revealed the extent of large-scale
structural rearrangements that accompany the membrane fusion process.
These include (a) the dissociation of HA1–HA1 monomers, (b) the folding of region B from a loop conformation
in the prefusion state to a helical conformation in the postfusion
state, (c) the release of the fusion peptide from its burial site
at the prefusion state to insert into the target membrane, and (d)
the folding back
of helix E to deliver the C-terminal transmembrane domain to the same
end of the molecule as the fusion peptide., Among these expected structural rearrangements, a recent study of
an early fusion intermediate of influenza A/H2 HA suggested that steps
a and b likely precede step c, and a
study of single influenza virions indicated that
step c is a rate-limiting step in hemifusion with a decrease in pH. However, we still lack an in-depth understanding
of
the molecular basis for these large-scale structural rearrangements.

With a low level of sequence identity with influenza A virus HA
(at only ∼20% for HA1 and ∼29% for HA2 residues 31–181) and having diverged from each other
some 2000 years ago, influenza B virus
HA can be regarded as a distant “cousin”
to influenza A virus HA. A wealth of structures of influenza A virus
HA subtypes H1–H3, H5, H7, H9, H13, H14, and H17 and influenza B virus HA,, in the prefusion state and of influenza
A/H3N2 HA in the postfusion state, exist. The
newly determined structure of influenza B virus HA2 in
the postfusion state as reported here has filled an important structural
gap in
the field and allowed the identification of conserved features in
the conformational changes of both influenza A and B virus HA. They
appear to use similar pathways upon induction of acidic pH that serves
to separate ionic residues strategically placed as clusters in prefusion
structures.,

Despite the similar transition
pathways shared between them, the
detailed mechanisms used by influenza A and B virus HA proteins may
differ. For instance, our structural analysis revealed that at the
membrane distal end of the HA molecule, influenza A virus HA constantly
has very loosely packed HA1–HA1 interfaces
compared to those of influenza B virus HA (Figure a,b and Table ). Probably related to this loose packing is the fact that
influenza A virus HA proteins have large internal cavities at the
HA1–HA2 interface that is connected to
the outside aqueous solution and contain B-loops that are more exposed
than in influenza B virus HA (Figure c,d and
Table ).
The transition from the prefusion state to the postfusion state of
influenza HA can be described by the transition state theory,
possibly via multiple intermediate states,, where the acidic pH serves to
lower
the transition state energy barrier(s). This is presumably
accomplished through protonation of ionizable residues strategically
located at different locations throughout the protein to induce large-scale
structural rearrangements.,, Thus, some, if not all, of the structural features of influenza
A virus
HA mentioned above might lead to a higher sensitivity to pH changes
or, in other words, decrease more substantially the transition state
energy barrier(s) compared to that of influenza B virus HA. On the
other hand, the less buried position of the fusion peptide in influenza
B virus HA and its weakened interactions with Asp-112 and Asn-109
(Figure g,h), in conjunction with the higher
helical
propensity of the B-loop (Figure d), could
result in lower transition state
energy barriers, as shown by the structure of influenza A/H3N2 HA
containing an Asp-112 → Gly mutation. Recent studies clearly indicate a role of fusion pH
in the pathogenicity and transmission of influenza virus.− On one hand, HA needs to have sufficient stability so that it is
not activated prematurely, as evidenced by the contribution of stabilizing
mutations in promoting airborne transmissibility of avian H5N1 virus., On the other hand, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus tends to fuse
at higher pH. Therefore, systematically
investigating the key chemical–structural
elements that impact HA’s fusion pH and kinetics and their
contributions to the pathogenicity and transmissibility of influenza
virus is an urgent task. The new structure of influenza B virus HA2 reported in this study and the common or unique structural
features identified herein provide general guidance for such studies.
Ultimately, studies along this line of research will provide a sound
foundation for the development of next-generation antiviral fusion
inhibitors.
