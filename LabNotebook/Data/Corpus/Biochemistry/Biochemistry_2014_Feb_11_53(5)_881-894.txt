The contributions of protein
dynamics to enzyme catalysis have been studied with great interest
recently. Kinetic isotope effects provide evidence for quantum mechanical
hydrogen tunneling for various enzymatic reactions, and the hydrogen
transfer could be facilitated by protein motions that shorten the
hydrogen donor–acceptor distance (DAD).− Fast protein
motions could be coincidental, coupled, correlated, or in thermal
equilibrium with the reaction coordinate.− The motions can involve the whole protein, as amino acid residues
distant from the active site can act through connected networks.− Structural, kinetic, and computational studies of enzymes that are
perturbed by site-directed amino acid substitutions can provide fundamental
information about the roles of protein motions in catalysis.

Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, EC 1.1.1.1) is a good subject
for these studies because structures can be determined at atomic resolution
and the catalytic mechanism is well-described. X-ray crystallography
of alcohol dehydrogenase has identified some of the dynamics involved
in catalysis. The enzyme undergoes a global conformational change
when coenzyme and substrate analogues bind.− X-ray crystallography
also provides evidence for puckering of the reduced ring in ternary
complexes with aldehyde analogues and
of the oxidized ring in complexes with fluoro alcohols. Deformation of the nicotinamide ring may be
important for the formation of the tunneling-ready state.,− Horse liver ADH, as studied with its mutated forms,
also exhibits kinetic isotope effects consistent with hydrogen tunneling.−

Schwartz and co-workers proposed that thermal motions, namely,
“protein-promoting vibrations” (PPV), of specific amino
acid residues facilitate the chemical reaction by modulating the distance
between substrates, significantly affecting catalysis by lowering
the height and shortening the width of the reaction barrier.,− The calculations identified Ser-144, Gly-181, Val-203,
Gly-204, Val-207, Glu-267, Ile-269, and Val-292 as residues in a conserved
evolutionary sequence that contributes to PPV. The I269S substitution
in the adenine binding site produced large increases in steady-state
kinetic constants and made hydride transfer rate-limiting for ethanol
oxidation, but with only a modest decrease in the rate constant for
transfer., The V292S substitution in the nicotinamide
binding site also produced large increases in steady-state kinetic
constants and made hydride transfer rate-limiting, but with only a
4-fold decrease in the rate constant for benzyl alcohol oxidation.

The subjects of this study are Val-203,
which contacts the nicotinamide
ring, and Val-207, which is in a hydrophobic cluster near Val-203.
Val-207 is highly conserved in dimeric ADHs, but the human class 1A
and 1B isoenzymes and the plant enzymes have an alanine residue. We expected that the V207A substitution should
alter rate-promoting vibrations by creating a cavity and interrupting
dynamic interactions. Large to small substitutions within the hydrophobic
cores of enzymes can lead to cavities, local shifts or collapse in
structures, or introduction of water molecules.− A valine to
alanine substitution can decrease protein stability by ∼2 kcal/mol,
which should have a large effect on protein dynamics.,

Previous work showed that substitution of Val-203 (with Leu,
Ala,
or Gly) in ADH significantly decreases the catalytic efficiency for
benzyl alcohol oxidation and diminishes the hydrogen tunneling, as
compared to that of the reference F93W enzyme. The V203A substitution moderately affects steady-state
kinetic constants but decreases the rate of transfer of hydrogen from
benzyl alcohol by 16-fold. The diminished
contribution of hydrogen tunneling was attributed to an apparent increase
of 0.4–0.8 Å in the DAD for hydride transfer in the ground-state
Michaelis complex, as compared to that of F93W ADH.,,, Molecular
dynamics and normal-mode analysis suggest that anticorrelated motions
of the catalytic and coenzyme binding domains can push the substrates
together, and the V203A substitution could allow the nicotinamide
ring to move away from the substrate and diminish the fraction of
reactive conformations.− Theoretical analyses support
the idea that the PPV would be modulated and the hydride transfer
rate would be decreased in V203A ADH.,, (Large to small substitutions of the homologous residue,
Leu-176, in a thermophilic ADH also decreased catalytic turnover modestly
and altered the temperature dependence of the kinetic isotope effect.) However, the previous crystallographic studies
were conducted on the NAD–2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) complexes
of the F93W/V203A enzyme at 100 K at a resolution of 2.0 Å and
of the V203A enzyme at 100 K and 2.5 Å, and those complexes were
compared to the complex of the F93W enzyme determined at 277 K and
a resolution of 2.0 Å as the reference structure. It is important
to determine the structures in the same space groups and under the
same conditions, and it would be relevant to determine structures
of the complexes with a benzyl alcohol because it was used for the
kinetics and isotope studies. In this work, atomic-resolution structures
(1.1 Å) were determined for V203A ADH complexed with NAD+ and 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl alcohol (PFB) or TFE, which
are unreactive analogues of the good substrates, but not oxidized
by the enzyme because of the strong electron withdrawing effects of
the fluorines.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
Reagent-grade
chemicals were used as received
unless specified otherwise. Alcohols and aldehydes were distilled
prior to use. LiNAD+ and Na2NADH were obtained
from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Benzyl alcohol-α,α-d2 (98.6% D) was obtained from MSD Isotopes.
NADD [(4R)-[4-2H]nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide] was prepared by reduction of NAD+ with ethanol-d5 by yeast ADH1 and purification by chromatography
on DEAE-cellulose.

Enzyme Preparations
The plasmid pBPP/EqADH1E, encoding the E isoenzyme
found in the liver of domestic horse
(Equus caballus, NCBI taxonomy ID 9796), GenBank
accession number M64864, and UniProtKB entry P00327, was used for site-directed
mutagenesis. (The amino-terminal methionine
residue is removed during protein processing in vivo, so that the sequence begins with Ser-1 and ends with Phe-374.)
The Stratagene Quick Change method with degenerate oligonucleotide
primers synthesized by Life Technologies was used to prepare the V207A
and V207G substitutions. The forward primer had the following sequence
(and the complementary reverse primer is implied), where the underlines
and italics mark the sites of mutation and an introduced FokI recognition site, respectively: 5′-GGA GTG GGC CTG TCT (A/G)(T/C/G)T ATC ATG GGA TGT AAA GCA GCC-3′. Plasmids were transformed into
XL1-Blue supercompetent cells, and transformants were selected on
LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 12.5 μg/mL
tetracycline. The V207A and V207G mutations were identified by digestion
with the FokI restriction enzyme and confirmed by
sequencing of the complete coding sequence at The University of Iowa
DNA Facility. The plasmid for the V203A enzyme was also prepared from
the wild-type pBPP/EqADH plasmid and provided to
us by J. P. Klinman.

The recombinant
wild-type, V203A, and V207A ADHs were expressed and purified according
to the published procedure. Purified
enzymes showed a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate with Coomassie blue staining
and contained no bound nucleotides as the A280/A260 ratio was 1.45. A standard enzyme
assay was used for the calculation of specific activity, and the protein concentration was determined
with an extinction coefficient of 0.455 A280/cm for a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The concentration of active sites
was determined by titration with NAD+ in the presence of
pyrazole.

Kinetic Studies
Solutions of coenzymes and substrates
were prepared just before use. Concentrations of coenzymes and substrates
were determined spectrophotometrically: ε260 = 18
mM–1 cm–1 for NAD+,
ε340 = 6.2 mM–1 cm–1 for NADH, ε256 = 200 M–1 cm–1 for benzyl alcohol, and ε248 = 12.5
mM–1 cm–1 for benzaldehyde. For
all kinetics experiments, 33 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 0.25
mM EDTA (pH 8.0) at 25 °C was used. Initial velocity and inhibition
studies monitored continuous NADH formation or oxidation on an SLM
4800C fluorimeter (λex = 340 nm, and λem = 460 nm), with fitting of the progress curves to a line
or a parabola to obtain the initial velocities. Inner filter effects
at a high concentration (&gt;10 μM) of NADH were corrected for.
Cleland’s programs SEQUEN and COMP were used to calculate kinetic constants; errors on the estimates
were &lt;25% of the values.

Transient kinetics were studied
with a BioLogic SFM3 stopped-flow instrument, with a dead time of
2.5 ms. The transient oxidation reaction was measured by following
the change in absorbance at 332 nm after mixing 15 μN enzyme,
2 mM NAD+, and varied concentrations (0.05–0.3 mM)
of either protio benzyl alcohol or benzyl-α,α-d2 alcohol.

X-ray Crystallography
Complexes of the mutated ADHs
with NAD+ and the fluoro alcohols were prepared as described
previously. The enzymes were first crystallized
by dialysis of ∼10 mg/mL enzyme against 10% ethanol in 10 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) at 5 °C. The crystals were collected,
redissolved in buffer with some added KCl, and dialyzed extensively
at 5 °C against 50 mM ammonium N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonate
and 0.25 mM EDTA buffer (pH 6.7) (pH measured at 25 °C; pH 7.0
at 4 °C). Crystals suitable for X-ray were prepared by dialyzing
∼1 mL of 10 mg/mL enzyme against 10 mL of the pH 6.7 buffer
and 1 mM NAD+ and either 100 mM TFE or 10 mM PFB (Ki = 1.9 μM for V203A ADH) at 4 °C by slowly increasing the concentration of
2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol to ∼13% by dialysis, when crystals
formed. Then the concentration of diol was increased over several
days to ∼25%, which provides cryoprotection at 100 K. The crystals
were mounted on fiber loops and flash-vitrified by rapid immersion
in liquid nitrogen for storage and data collection.

Data for
a crystal of the complex of V203A ADH with NAD+ and PFB
were collected at 100 K using the synchrotron at the Advanced Photon
Source at Argonne National Laboratories on June 16, 2007, on the GM/CA-CAT
beamline with an X-ray wavelength of 1.0332 Å and a MAR300CCD
detector, with high- and low-resolution passes (at a 120 mm crystal
to detector distance with 0.25° oscillations, 360° total,
and 1 s exposures, and at 193 mm with 0.5° oscillations, 360°
total, with 0.5 s exposures). The data for a crystal of V203A ADH
complexed with NAD+ and TFE were collected on July 13,
2007, at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Berkeley, CA, using beamline
4.2.2, at 95 mm, an X-ray wavelength of 0.802 Å, 0.2° oscillations
for 297 deg, with 6 s exposures. The data for the V207A ADH–NAD+–PFB complex were collected on December 13, 2008, at
ALS beamline 4.2.2 with an X-ray wavelength of 0.827 Å at 97
mm, with 0.25° oscillations over 360° total.

Data
were also collected for the complex of V203A ADH with NAD+ and PFB at ALS beamline 4.2.2 on December 12, 2012, on the
new Research Detectors Inc. CMOS detector (282 mm × 295 mm) with
shutter-less data collection at 100 mm at 1.25 Å wavelength,
in an attempt to increase the magnitude of the anomalous signal for
zinc. Oscillation frames were collected with a 0.1° rotation
angle over 360° at a κ angle of 0° and over 180°
at a κ angle of −20°. Data were processed with XDS to give good data to 1.35 Å resolution.

Data for the reported structures were processed with d*TREK. Structures were solved by molecular replacement
with the coordinates for the refined structures of wild-type ADH complexed
with NAD+ and PFB or TFE [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 4DWV or 4DXH()]. The initial models used for refinement had alanine at
the substituted sites and no fluoro alcohol, and the electron density
maps showed no density for methyl groups for valine residues at position
203 or 207; however, there was clear density for the alcohols. The
structures were refined by cycles of maximum likelihood, restrained
refinement with REFMAC5 with riding hydrogens
and anisotropic temperature factors in the final cycles. The monomer
dictionary for NAD (named NAJ in our files) was modified to remove
the restraints on planarity and to relax the restraints on bond distances
for the nicotinamide ring so that puckered oxidized or reduced rings
could be fit. Model building used O. The volume of the cavity created for V207A ADH
was calculated by S. Ramaswamy with VOIDOO using a probe radius of 1.0 Å and compared with that of the
wild-type structure. Figures were prepared using the Molray web interface
in Uppsala, Sweden.

After refinement
with REFMAC had been completed, SHELXL-2013 was used for 10 cycles of CGLS refinement and
one full-matrix cycle of least-squares refinement (BLOC 1) with no
restraints applied for the coenzyme, to calculate bond distances and
angles and their errors for the nicotinamide ring and ligand interactions.
Riding hydrogens were added to the protein, coenzyme, and fluoro alcohols.
Errors were calculated with SHELXL-2013 using all unique reflections
(MERG 2) and thus were slightly different from those calculated with
SHELXL-97 previously. Weighted averages
for two subunits were calculated with EXCEL.

Results
Preparation
of ADHs
Mutagenesis with the degenerate
oligonucleotide primers produced two different plasmids, encoding
the V207G and V207A single substitutions in ADH, and the active enzyme
was expressed with both, as determined by the enzyme assay and staining
for enzyme activity after electrophoresis on an agarose gel. However, the V207G enzyme was not stable during
purification, whereas the V207A enzyme could be purified to apparent
homogeneity and thus could be studied further. Recombinant wild-type
ADH was also purified for comparison. Titrations of active site concentrations
of the soluble enzyme showed that ∼80% of the subunits of the
V207A enzyme could bind NAD+, whereas ∼60% of the
V203A enzyme could; most preparations of the wild-type enzyme titrate
at ∼80%. Turnover numbers based on the standard assay and active
site titrations are listed in Table .

Kinetics of Wild-Type,
V207A, and V203A ADHs
Steady-state
kinetic constants were determined with initial velocity studies by
varying the concentrations of both substrates (NAD+ and
alcohol or NADH and aldehyde) in a systematic manner (5 × 5 matrix
of concentrations) and by product inhibition of one coenzyme against
the other coenzyme as the varied substrate in order to determine the
competitive inhibition (dissociation) constants for coenzymes. The
kinetic constants for V207A ADH acting on ethanol and acetaldehyde
were very similar to those found previously for the natural wild-type
enzyme,, as were the kinetic constants with benzyl
alcohol and benzaldehyde., Because different experimental
designs and experimenters can obtain kinetic constants that differ
by 2-fold (or more), the experiments were repeated several times with
recombinant wild-type and V207A enzymes, with the results listed in
Table . In these experiments, the initial
velocity results in the direction of alcohol oxidation show the intersecting
pattern typical of a sequential bi mechanism, but for aldehyde reduction,
the patterns show parallel lines, which can arise if Kiq is smaller than Kq and
the reduction is kinetically favored. Thus, the Kiq value was only determined by competitive inhibition
of NADH against NAD+. The small standard deviations and
the agreement of the Keq value with experimentally
determined values indicate that the kinetic constants are well-determined.
The V207A substitution modestly (2–3-fold), but significantly,
increased the values of Kp, Kq, and Kia. The increased
magnitude of Kia with V207A ADH was also
confirmed when the substrate was ethanol or acetaldehyde. For reference,
Table  shows that the V203A substitution also
increased several kinetic constants, but not Kia.

Transient kinetic studies
of benzyl alcohol oxidation were used to study directly the hydride
transfer step for these enzymes (Table ).
Wild-type ADH shows an exponential “burst” phase with
a maximal rate constant of 24 s–1 at saturating
alcohol concentrations (H/D isotope effect of 3.6) followed by a steady-state
phase. The two-phase reaction is characteristic
of a rapid hydride transfer followed by slower release of NADH. Likewise,
V207A ADH showed a burst phase with a maximal rate constant of 30
s–1, and a substrate H/D isotope effect of 2.7,
which was difficult to determine because the burst phase was not very
distinct from the steady-state phase with the deutero benzyl alcohol.
(The rate constant for the burst phase approximates the rate constant
for hydride transfer, but simulations of the complete mechanism are
required to obtain the microscopic value.) In contrast, V203A ADH shows no burst phase, as hydride transfer
is predominantly rate-limiting for turnover, with a rate constant
of 1.5 s–1.

Isotope
effects on steady-state kinetic parameters were determined
by separate initial velocity studies with protio or deutero substrates
(Table ). The values for the wild-type and
V207A enzymes are similar. DV1/Et and DV2/Et values are somewhat larger
than 1.0, DV1/(EtKb) and DV2/(EtKp) are more substantial, and DV1/(EtKa) and DV2/(EtKq) are 1.0 within
errors. The results are consistent with an ordered bi-bi mechanism
with coenzymes binding first and release of coenzymes being predominantly
rate-limiting for catalytic turnover. In contrast, the mechanism of
the V203A enzyme is partly random for oxidation of benzyl alcohol.

X-ray Crystallography
Data collection and refinement
statistics for the atomic-resolution structures are given in Table . The overall structures of the complexes with the
V203A and V207A enzyme are essentially identical to the corresponding
structures of the wild-type enzyme, and they are in the “closed”
conformation with NAD and the fluoro alcohols in an approximation
of the Michaelis complex., The electron density
maps show well-defined positions for the NAD+ and the fluoro
alcohols, which are very similar to those for the wild-type enzyme.
In all of these complexes, the pro-R hydrogen of
the alcohol is directed toward the re face of C4N
of the nicotinamide ring, as would be expected for direct transfer
of a hydride ion, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 4 in ref ().

The electron density maps for the V207A enzyme clearly
show that
residue 207 is an alanine and that the local structures of V207A and
wild-type ADHs are almost identical (Figure ), and the structures (all α-carbons) superimpose with an overall
rmsd of 0.10 Å. The high-resolution structures of ternary complexes
of human ADH1A and ADH1B1 (with Ala-207) also superimpose well on
human ADH1C2 (with Val-207) without significant conformational changes. It is interesting that the bilobate cavity created
by the V207A substitution does not affect the protein structure significantly,
and no (less than 1/100 of the level observed for oxygens) electron
density for new water molecules near Ala-207 is visible in the maps.
The total volume available for waters in the cavity was calculated
with VOIDOO to be 92 Å3. There is no cavity near Val-207
in the wild-type ADH structure that can accommodate a water. Two water
molecules could be positioned into the relatively apolar cavity in
V207A ADH. One would be within van der Waals contact (3.2–3.5
Å) of aliphatic carbons of Gly-179, Ala-207, and valine residues
268 and 292. The other water could make a hydrogen bond with the O
atom of Gly-179 but would make close contacts (3.0–3.1 Å)
with side chains of Ser-183 (CB), Ala-207, and Phe-226. It is not
likely that disordered water molecules are present in V207A ADH because
the cavities are apolar (hydrophobic) and small (just large enough
to accommodate waters) so that water should be detectable by X-ray
crystallography, as concluded from a thoughtful review. No waters were identified near Ala-207 in the
human ADH1A and ADH1B1 structures. Although
cavities can destabilize protein structures, the protein scaffold
of ADH is apparently able to maintain the structure when the bilobate
cavity is empty of waters.

Structure and electron density of V207A ADH
(PDB entry 4NFH) near residue 207.
The space created by removal of two methyl groups is not filled. The
structure of wild-type ADH in the same orientation is colored green
(PDB entry 4DWV, 1.12 Å).

Structure and electron density of V203A ADH (PDB entry 4NG5) near residue 203.
The space created by removal of two methyl groups is occupied by a
water (red sphere) that contacts C6N of the nicotinamide ring of NAD
and forms hydrogen bonds with the guanidino NH2 of Arg-369 and phosphate
O1N atom of NAD. PFB with fluorines (magenta) and zinc (brown) are
also shown.

The electron density
maps for the V203A complexes, with PFB or
TFE, also clearly confirm the substitution at residue 203 (Figure ). The structures of
the wild-type and V203A ADH complexes are very similar. The wild-type
(PDB entry 4DWV) and V203A ADHs complexed with PFB superimpose with an overall rmsd
for all α-carbons of 0.13 Å. The wild-type (PDB entry 4DXH) and V203A enzymes
complexed with TFE superimpose with an overall rmsd of 0.10 Å;
the wild-type and the F93W/V203A (PDB entry 1A71()) enzymes superimpose with an rmsd of 0.18 Å. However,
the major difference between the wild-type and V203A ADHs is that
the cavity created by removing the two methyl groups introduces space
for a new water molecule (labeled 994) that appears in both subunits
A and B of the complexes with either PFB or TFE. This water molecule
was identified, independently, in the F93W/V203A ADH structure. This water makes a close contact to the nicotinamide
ring of the NAD (3.1–3.2 Å to C6N) and forms good hydrogen
bonds (2.8 Å) to the NH2 atom of the guanidino group of Arg-369
and phosphate O1N atom of the NAD (Figure ). In the wild-type enzyme, the CG2 methyl group of Val-203 is 4.5
Å from the NH1 atom of Arg-369 and 3.9 Å from the O1N atom
of the phosphate of NAD; the V203A substitution creates a cavity in
that space.

Artifactual Heterogeneity of Structure
It appears in
the crystal structures that V203A ADH complexes have some heterogeneity
because of the loss of some of the catalytic zinc, accompanied by
a decreased occupancy of the fluoro alcohols and multiple conformations
of some amino acids near the active site. Occupancies for catalytic
zincs in both subunits of both complexes are estimated to be ∼60%,
based on the electron density and comparisons of temperature factors
with the structural zinc and with both zincs in the wild-type enzyme.
The occupancy for the coenzyme does not appear to be affected, which
is consistent with previous observations that the enzyme lacking the
catalytic zincs still binds NAD+ and NADH, even though
the enzyme is not catalytically active. Crystallographic studies showed that NADH binds in about the same
position, in the closed conformation of the zinc-free enzyme, as in
the wild-type enzyme. The occupancies
of the fluoro alcohols are also decreased, to ∼75%, in the
V203A enzymes. (These estimates are approximate, but the peak electron
densities for carbons in the fluoro alcohols are ∼75% of those
for the carbons in the imidazole group of His-67.) In the absence
of the catalytic zinc, perhaps some fluoro alcohol binds weakly. The
absence of the catalytic zinc also appears to allow an alternative
conformation (∼20%) of Cys-46, where the sulfhydryl group of
Cys-46 is rotated close to the carboxyl group of Glu-68. The rotation
of Cys-46 in the zinc-depleted enzyme was observed before in crystal
structures of the apoenzyme, but not
in the complex of the zinc-depleted enzyme with bound NADH. (The data for these structures are no longer
available for closer inspection.)

It appears that the loss of
catalytic zinc is associated with formation of alternative conformations
in ∼40% of the subunits of the V203A enzyme complexes. Arg-369,
which usually interacts with the pyrophosphate of the coenzyme in
the wild-type enzyme, has an alternative conformation that is retracted
and instead interacts with the carboxyl group of an alternative conformation
of Glu-68 and an additional, partially occupied water (labeled A or
B 995). Slight changes in the positions of the side chains of Glu-68
and Arg-369 were also observed in the zinc-depleted enzyme. Alternative conformations of Cys-170 and Leu-171
accommodate the changes in Glu-68. This network of alternative conformations
(Arg-369, Glu-68, Cys-170, Leu-171, and a water) is not present in
wild-type or V207A ADHs and does not appear to be an obligatory consequence
of the V203A substitution because ∼60% of the subunits have
residue interactions that are similar to those for the wild-type enzyme.
There is no steric imperative for the alternative conformations due
to the V203A substitution. It appears that the set of alternative
conformations may be an artifactual result of the loss of zinc due
to handling of the protein sample, but these conformations could also
be among the ensemble of structures that are available to the enzyme,
as they could also be accommodated in the enzyme with the catalytic
zinc. It should be noted that the previously determined structures
of the V203A enzymes complexed with TFE (PDB entries 1AXG() and 1A71()) do not show any alternative conformations,
and the temperature factors are consistent with full occupancies for
the catalytic zincs.

There are also some weak, unexplained densities
(particularly in
the active sites of V203A ADH complexed with TFE) where zinc ions
associated with the phosphate O1N atom of the NAD, oxidized sulfur
of Cys-46, or waters could be modeled at partial occupancies. However,
anomalous difference electron density maps readily indicated the catalytic
and structural zincs but showed no peaks that could be fit with a
zinc at more than 0.05 occupancy as compared to the structural zincs.
(The data collected at 1.0332 and 0.802 Å were used for these
calculations, and the data at 1.25 Å were confirmatory.) Furthermore,
refinement with partial occupancy of Cys-46 as a sulfenic acid gave
unreasonable bond distances. Thus, our subsequent interpretations
are based on the predominant structures, which represent ∼60%
of the molecules of the V203A enzyme complexes and ∼100% of
the V207A enzyme. Atomic-resolution structures offer the opportunity
to see fine details of the structures, but interpretation of the electron
density maps is challenging and remains incomplete. The assignment
of occupancies is semiquantitative, as they are based on relative
electron densities, and B factors for the alternative
conformations may actually differ because of intrinsic motions of
the atoms.

Geometry of Ligand Binding
The positions
of the ligands
(NAD and fluoro alcohols) in complexes of the V207A and V203A enzymes
are very similar to the corresponding positions for the wild-type
enzymes, but the position of the nicotinamide ring in the V203A ADHs
differs slightly from that in the wild-type enzyme (Figure ). The atomic-resolution data and refinement with
SHELXL permit a detailed analysis of the structures and geometry of
binding (Table ). The bond distances for the
nicotinamide rings are well-estimated and are most consistent with
a strained, oxidized ring with modest puckering, as described previously
for the complexes of the wild-type enzyme. The puckering angles for the nicotinamide rings in the complexes
of V203A ADH are somewhat larger than those for wild-type ADH, but
not as large as those observed for complexes of ADHs crystallized
with NADH.,,

Comparison
of structures of wild-type (green, PDB entry 4DWV) and V203A (atom
coloring, PDB entry 4NG5) enzymes complexed with NAD and PFB shows a small difference in
puckering of the nicotinamide ring. The water in the V203A enzyme
is colored red and the zinc brown.

Comparison of structures of V203A enzymes complexed with NAD and
TFE (PDB entry 4NFS, V203A, 1.12 Å, atom coloring; PDB entry 1A71, F93W/V203A, 2.0
Å, green) shows that the structures are remarkably similar. The
aromatic rings of Phe-93 and Trp-93 and other atoms overlap, but the
trifluoromethyl groups show a different rotation.

However, the V203A
enzymes appear to have ∼60% occupancy
by the catalytic zinc, and the absence of the zinc in some active
sites could allow the coenzyme to move or pucker more than for the
wild-type and other mutated ADHs that retain the zinc. We tried to
determine if the bound coenzyme was a mixture of NAD+ and
NADH by refining the structures with alternative conformations (60:40
occupancies), but the bond distances were poorly defined, with errors
of 0.2–0.4 Å (as compared to 0.02 Å for one conformation).
In addition, as shown in Table , the bond
distances in the nicotinamide rings are not intermediate between oxidized
and reduced nicotinamide rings. We conclude that the predominant structures
for the active forms of the V203A enzyme contain NAD+,
catalytic zinc, and the fluoro alcohol. The distances between C4N
and the carbon of the alcohol from which hydrogen would be transferred
are very similar among the respective complexes; however, the average
distance in V207A ADH is 0.08 Å shorter than for wild-type enzyme,
and the distances for the complexes with TFE are 0.09 Å longer
in the V203A enzyme than in the wild-type enzyme. The catalytic zinc
to alcohol oxygen distances are consistent with zinc alkoxide, and
the distances between the alcohol oxygen and Ser-48 hydroxyl oxygen
are consistent with a low-barrier hydrogen bond.

Comparison
of Structures of ADHs Complexed with NAD and Fluoro
Alcohols
The overall structures of the wild-type and mutated
enzymes determined in this study are very similar to one another and
to those previously determined for complexes of V203A, F93W, and F93W/V203A
ADHs complexed with NAD and TFE. Indeed, the ligand positions in our
V203A enzyme structure are essentially identical with those found
in the F93W/V203A ADH complex previously described, as shown in Figure . However, comparisons of the wild-type and V203A
ADHs show some interesting and complicated small differences, as detailed
in Table . The NAD C4N to “ligand C”
distance is the putative distance for hydride transfer between the
reacting carbons of the substrates in the ground-state model of the
Michaelis complex. The value for the F93W enzyme (used as the “wild-type”
reference, PDB entry 1AXE()) of 3.16 Å is clearly shorter
than the value we found for the wild-type enzyme (3.44 Å, PDB
entry 4DXH).
This difference is not caused by the F93W substitution, as the indole
rings superimpose on the benzene rings in these structures (rmsd of
0.24 Å for the coenzyme binding domains, residues 176–318,
for PDB entries 4DXH and 1AXE).
The F93W structure was determined at 4 °C, but the difference
in temperature probably does not account for the shorter distance,
as the wild-type structures with PFB (PDB entry 4DWV at 100 K and PDB
entry 1HLD at
277 K) have similar C4N–ligand C distances, even though superimposition
of the coenzyme binding domains (with an rmsd of 0.31 Å) shows
that the molecule is slightly expanded at the higher temperature.
Rather, it appears that the positions of TFE in the F93W (PDB entry 1AXE) and wild-type (PDB
entry 1AXG)
enzymes are somewhat different than in the wild-type enzyme determined
at 1.12 Å (PDB entry 4DXH). It is most relevant that the NAD C4N–ligand
C distances in the V203A enzymes (PDB entries 1A71 and 4NFS) are essentially
identical and are ∼0.1 Å longer than the distance in the
wild-type enzyme determined at 1.12 Å (PDB entry 4DXH). The NAD C4N–ligand
C distances in the complexes with PFB are also essentially the same
(3.38 ± 0.02 Å), except that the distance in V207A enzyme
is 0.08 Å shorter than for the wild-type enzyme.

The distances (Å) are averages
of two subunits, in structures determined at 100 K unless noted otherwise.

It was previously proposed that the
increase in the C4N–ligand C distance due to the V203A substitution
resulted from movement of the nicotinamide ring toward residue 203,
because of removal of methyl group CG2 of Val-203, which is in van
der Waals contact (3.64 Å) with NAD C6N. The NAD C4N– or C6N–203 CA distances allow comparison
of these enzymes and show the relative movement of the nicotinamide
ring. The C4N–203 CA distances in the TFE and PFB complexes
in the wild-type enzymes are very similar to the distances in the
V203A enzymes, at an average of 5.43 Å (within 0.1 Å). (The
distance is slightly longer for the F93W enzyme.) The NAD C6N–203
CA distances are very interesting because all of the V203A enzyme
complexes have shorter distances (average of 4.23 Å) than for
“wild-type” equivalents (average of 4.50 Å). This
difference is due to a “tilt” of the nicotinamide rings
in the structures determined previously, where crystallographic refinement
restrained the planarity of the ring, or to ring puckering in this
study, where no restraints on planarity were applied. The actual structures
from the different studies may be similar even if the refinements
produce different results.

Amplitudes of Motions from X-ray Crystallography
Although
some enzymologists refer to protein structures determined by X-ray
crystallography as “static” and possibly not the same
as in solution, such structures provide, at least, average structures
of thermodynamically accessible states, with dynamic aspects included
in the temperature factors and defined alternative conformations (including
“ensembles”, which can be determined at atomic resolution).
The structures can represent the best available view of the ground
state for catalysis. For the structures of the V203A and V207A ADH
complexes, the temperature factors and alternative conformations of
residues at the active site are essentially the same as those for
the wild-type enzyme. As noted before, leucine residues 57 and 309
have alternative conformations in the complexes of the wild-type enzyme
with TFE or PFB, while the conformations of Leu-116 differ between
the complexes with TFE and PFB due to interactions with the alcohols. The V203A, V207A, and wild-type ADHs have essentially
the same set of conformations. Although proteins are dynamic ensembles
in global and local structure, once the
substrates are bound, as in the structures described here, it appears
that hydrogen transfer would depend mostly upon the local dynamics.
Using terms defined by others, we suggest that the complexes described
here represent “preorganized”, states
that approximate “tunneling-ready states” of the substrates that form after modest “reorganization”
involving fast protein and substrate motions., We further suggest that the amplitudes of these motions can be estimated
from dynamic information obtained from X-ray crystallography.

Temperature factors (“B”, Debye–Waller,
or anisotropic displacement, factors) provide information about fast
motions in proteins but include contributions from the crystal lattice
disorder, translations and rotations of pseudorigid subunits (TLS),
internal collective motions, and local displacements.− A “residual” (or “local”) temperature
factor for particular residues can be calculated after removing the
contribution of the “global” crystal lattice disorder
and anisotropic motions of the subunits by TLS refinement in REFMAC. The local B factor would reflect
fast motions and vibrations (nanosecond or faster), but not conformational
changes (millisecond), which do not occur at 100 K.

Refinements
(10 cycles of TLS followed by 10 cycles of maximum-likelihood
restrained refinement of isotropic temperature factors) with the coenzyme
binding and catalytic domains as TLS groups of the structures of wild-type
and mutated enzymes studied here significantly decrease the B factors for individual atoms, but residual B factors are still large. The local B factors for
residue 203 or residue 207 range from 5.5 to 8.6 Å2, which would correspond to mean displacements of 0.26–0.33
Å, at 100 K [u̅x = (B/8π2)1/2].
The temperature dependence of the B factor increases
by 4–5 Å2 per 100 K,− so that at
300 K, the estimated local B factors could be ∼16
Å2, corresponding to mean displacements of 0.45 Å.
Given such temperature factors, it appears that local equilibrium,
vibrational, motions of the amino acid residues can be important factors
in catalysis and would be comparable in the wild-type and mutated
enzymes.

The equilibrium motions of the substrates could also
decrease the
DAD from 3.4 Å in the observed complexes to ∼2.7 Å,
where the hydride could transfer optimally. Refinements with the four
domains of the two subunits and attached ligands as TLS groups (which
decreased mean main chain B values from 16.0 to 9.0)
produced average, residual B factors of 7 Å2 for the atoms of the nicotinamide rings and 9 Å2 for the carbons of the PFB for the wild-type enzyme. For
V203A ADH, similar refinement with four TLS groups (which decreased
mean main chain B values from 16.0 to 10.4) produced
values of 10 and 12 Å2 for the nicotinamide ring and
the PFB, respectively. The nicotinamide ring has more interactions
with the enzyme than does the benzyl alcohol, which is located in
a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates a variety of alcohols. Thus,
movement of the nicotinamide ring is somewhat restricted, whereas
the benzyl alcohol could occupy an ensemble of states. Extrapolation
to 300 K would give B values of 16–21 or mean
displacements of up to ∼0.5 Å. (The abstract graphic shows
atoms with radii of 0.5 Å.) If the motions of the substrates
are anticorrelated, it appears that the donor–acceptor distance
could often approach 2.7 Å. This analysis of B factors is an approximation, because the B factors
may be overestimated due to various contributions (errors in data
and modeling, radiation damage, etc.) that are not accounted for,
and the extrapolation from 100 to 300 K may be complicated by a “glass
transition” at ∼150 K., [Analysis
of the total, not “local”, B factors
for the structure of the wild-type enzyme complexed with NAD and PFB
determined at 4 °C (PDB entry 1HLD) also indicates amplitudes of motion
of 0.4–0.5 Å.] Nevertheless, it is significant that molecular
dynamics simulations provide fluctuations of similar magnitude in
ADH.,

Discussion
The
rationale for these experiments was that substitutions of valine
residues near the nicotinamide binding site with alanine residues
would produce cavities that would alter the local energetics, stability,
interactions, and protein motions. Many studies suggest that protein
dynamics are important for enzyme catalysis, but more direct experimental
evidence is needed. In particular, structural studies are required
to determine actual changes that might affect catalysis. This and
previous studies show that cavity formation is accompanied by disparate
effects on local structures and kinetics even though overall protein
structures and ligand binding are very similar. The results from this
study do not provide support for a substantial contribution of PPV
to catalysis, but they do raise questions about the roles of protein
dynamics in catalysis and provide foundations for further computational
studies that could relate structures to rates of catalysis.

V207A ADH
The V207A substitution caused only small
changes in catalysis by ADH since both steady-state and transient-state
kinetics were similar to those of the wild-type enzyme. Some 2–3-fold
effects on steady-state constants are probably real, but catalysis
is not altered substantially. The exponential burst phase for benzyl
alcohol oxidation, reflecting hydride transfer, and isotope effects
are essentially unchanged by the V207A substitution. The three-dimensional
structure of the complex with NAD and PFB is also essentially unchanged,
but the putative, “ground-state” hydride transfer distance
is decreased by 0.08 Å compared to that of the wild-type complex.
The cavity created by the substitution is apparently empty and not
occupied by water molecules, and local crystallographic B factors are not affected, suggesting that the protein scaffold is
quite stable and tolerates a cavity. We expected that the V207A substitution
would affect the dynamics of the proposed PPV network. Because the
structure of the complex and the rate of hydride transfer are essentially
unchanged, the results provide no evidence that Val-207 participates
in promoting vibrations. However, the results do not eliminate the
possibility of such a contribution because many residues may cooperate
in the vibrations and the quantitative effect on catalysis of the
substitution of a side chain is not known. A “rough calculation”
suggested that the promoting vibration in ADH lowered the free energy
barrier by 30%, but further calculations are required.

V203A ADH
The V203A substitution
moderately alters
the kinetics of ADH. The affinity for NADH and the catalytic efficiency
for benzyl alcohol oxidation are decreased ∼4-fold, and the
rate constant for hydride transfer for alcohol oxidation is decreased
16-fold, making hydride transfer a major rate-limiting step, as evidenced
by a 3.4-fold deuterium isotope effect on the steady-state turnover. Crystallography shows that the structures of
the complexes of V203A and wild-type enzymes with NAD and TFE or PFB
are very similar. The putative DAD (NAD C4N to methylene carbon of
the alcohol) in V203A ADH complexed with TFE is increased by 0.1 Å
relative to that in the wild-type ADH complex, but the distances are
the same for wild-type and V203A ADHs for the complexes with PFB.
The position of the nicotinamide ring is altered slightly in the complexes
of V203A ADH with either TFE or PFB because of puckering that brings
NAD C6N 0.3 Å closer to 203 CA than in the wild-type enzyme.
The carboxamido N7N of the nicotinamide ring retains hydrogen bonds
to the carbonyl oxygens of Val-292 and Ala-317 in the V203A enzyme,
and the nicotinamide O7N retains the hydrogen bond to the backbone
N of Phe-319. Interestingly, the removal of the CG2 methyl group of
Val-203 has allowed a water molecule to bind, which is 3.1 Å
from NAD C6N. The decreased affinity for NADH may be due to insertion
of the water molecule and less favorable hydrophobic interactions
near the nicotinamide ring.

Our kinetic and structural results
differ from some previous results. The catalytic efficiency for benzyl
alcohol oxidation was reported to have decreased by 36–44-fold
with the V203A substitution relative to that of the wild-type or F93W
enzymes, whereas we found a 4-fold decrease. This may be because the assay conditions are
very different, but in any case, the decreased rate constant for hydride
transfer and the altered isotope effects indicate that catalysis by
the V203A enzyme has been compromised. The previous structural studies
found an increase of 0.4–0.8 Å in the putative DAD, attributed
to tilting of the nicotinamide ring toward residue 203., The differences in the studies are not easily explained, but the
atomic-resolution data presented here show that the structure and
geometry of ligand binding of the V203A enzyme complexed with TFE
(PDB entry 4NFS) are almost identical with those of the F93W/V203A enzyme complexed
with TFE (PDB entry 1A71). In contrast, the geometry of the ligands in the “wild-type”
reference enzymes (PDB entries 4DXH and 1AXE) is different, mostly because of the
positioning of the TFE.

Because the V203A substitution has only
small effects on the structures
of the enzyme complexes, whereas the kinetics are affected, it appears
that the results are consistent with the proposal that Val-203 participates
in PPV. However, it remains to be determined if and how protein motions
are coupled to the reaction coordinate and account quantitatively
for the 16-fold effect on hydride transfer by the V203A substitution., Furthermore, the insertion of the water near the nicotinamide ring
in V203A ADH could affect the chemistry of hydride transfer because
the water interacts closely with the negatively charged phosphate
O1N and positively charged Arg-369 NH2, which should affect the electrostatics
near the nicotinamide ring. In Val-203 ADH, a methyl group may act
as an insulator between the charged groups and the nicotinamide ring.
The roles of nearby oxygens appear to be a general issue, because
a comprehensive survey of 340 PDB entries for enzymes with bound NAD(P)
showed that 75 structures had 153 close contacts (&lt;3.2 Å)
between the nicotinamide ring and oxygen atoms of water or protein
residues; several structures also showed puckered nicotinamide rings. Quantum mechanical calculations are required
to assess the roles of nearby oxygens and puckering of the nicotinamide
ring on hydride transfer.

Other Cavities in ADH
Substitutions
of other amino
acid residues that interact with the coenzyme created cavities that
were filled with a water or expelled a water. Val-292 was proposed
to participate in PPV; its side chain is close to the nicotinamide
ring, while its carbonyl oxygen interacts with N7N of the carboxamido
group and C2N of the nicotinamide ring. Substitution of Val-292 (with
Ala, Ser, or Thr) significantly increases (30–75-fold) the
dissociation constants for the coenzymes, while the hydride transfer
rate constants and catalytic efficiencies for benzyl alcohol oxidation
decrease by 3–5-fold., For V292S ADH, the
logarithm of the rate constant for hydride transfer for benzyl alcohol
oxidation is linearly dependent on the inverse temperature (ΔH⧧ ≈ 13 kcal/mol), whereas the
logarithm of catalytic efficiency for benzaldehyde reduction exhibits
a convex dependence on the inverse temperature that was fit by the
van’t Hoff equation (ΔH⧧ = 3.2 kcal/mol, and ΔCp⧧ ≈ 250 cal mol–1 K–1). The isotope effects for the forward and
reverse reactions catalyzed by the V292S enzyme are temperature-independent,
providing evidence of vibrationally assisted, quantum mechanical tunneling
in this enzyme. We suggested that the
convex van’t Hoff dependence is evidence of protein fluctuations
that affect the organization of reactants, as was also suggested for
a thermophilic ADH.

A structure
of the V292S enzyme crystallized with NAD+ and PFB determined
at 2.0 Å resolution (PDB entry 1JU9) shows that the protein conformation
is “open”, similar to the apoenzyme crystallized without
added coenzyme (PDB entry 8ADH or 1YE3), and electron density for the nicotinamide ribose and PFB is lacking,
indicating that the V292S substitution perturbs the conformational
change that accompanies coenzyme and substrate binding. A new water
molecule is observed in the cavity created by removal of a methyl
group of Val-292. The V292S substitution appears to alter the equilibrium
position for the conformational change of the enzyme–NAD+ complex by a factor of 50, so that only 20% of the complex
is in a state that would react with benzyl alcohol, as estimated from
the 5-fold decrease in the catalytic efficiency, V1/(EtKb). The substitution probably
does not prevent the conformational change, as the structure of the
V292T enzyme complexed with NAD+ and pyrazole is in the
closed conformation (PDB entry 1N8K). The new
water molecule is present in the closed conformation but is not in
contact with the nicotinamide ring. The V292S enzyme apparently retains
vibrationally assisted tunneling, and thus, the results do not provide
evidence that supports, but also do not exclude, a role for Val-292
in PPV.

The double substitution, G293A/P295T, in a flexible
loop of the
coenzyme binding domain greatly (100–700-fold) increases steady-state
kinetic constants and decreases the rate constant for benzyl alcohol
oxidation to 1.3 s–1, making hydride transfer rate-limiting
for catalytic turnover. A structure of
the enzyme crystallized with NAD and TFE is in the open conformation,
apparently unable to form the closed conformation because of steric
clashes involving Ala-293 and Thr-295 (PDB entry 1QLH). A new (as compared
to the apoenzyme, PDB entry 1YE3) water molecule is accommodated in the cavity because
of the P295T substitution, with a hydrogen bond to Thr-295 OG1, and
a second water is found in a cleft near Ala-293 O. Perhaps these waters
help to stabilize the open conformation, but it is signficant that
the enzyme retains high activity for hydride transfer.

In wild-type
ADH, a water fills a cavity near the nicotinamide
ring and makes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-317,
the hydroxyl group of Ser-182 and the backbone N of Gly-320., The carbonyl oxygen of Ala-317 also forms a hydrogen bond with N7N
of the nicotinamide moiety. Ala-317 is replaced by a cysteine residue
in human ADH4, and this was proposed to be the reason for the relatively
large kinetic constants (10–100-fold larger) for ADH4 compared
to those for horse ADH-E or human class I ADHs. However, the A317C
substitution in horse ADH-E has very small effects on steady-state
kinetic constants, even though the rate of hydride transfer from benzyl
alcohol decreases by 2.8-fold. The three-dimensional
structure determined at 1.2 Å of the complex with NAD and PFB
is almost identical with the structure of the wild-type enzyme, but
the sulfhydryl group of Cys-317 displaces the water. It appears that
the protein scaffold is relatively stable and can accommodate a water
in a new cavity or the loss of water when a cavity is filled by substitution
of an amino acid residue.

Perspectives on Catalysis by ADHs
It is generally believed
that hydrogen is transferred with quantum mechanical tunneling in
ADHs and that protein dynamics are involved. Geometries of substrates
or substrate analogues in the complexes studied here approximate expected
ground-state structures that could undergo direct hydrogen transfer
after small reorganization that yields a tunneling-ready state with
a calculated DAD of 3.2 Å, or closer to 2.7 Å
for a calculated transition state. The
structures show that the geometries of the active sites of V203A ADH
complexes, in particular the complex with NAD and PFB, are very similar
to those for wild-type ADH and raise a serious question about the
proposal that an increased ground-state DAD for hydrogen transfer
has led to diminished hydrogen tunneling for the V203A enzyme.,, Why is hydrogen tunneling diminished
in the V203A or F93W/V203A enzyme compared to that in the reference
enzyme (F93W variant) if the ligands in both complexes are similarly
preorganized and the ground-state DADs are similar? In terms of the
rate equation based on the Marcus-like model currently proposed for
hydrogen transfer, the simple explanation is that the energetic barrier
[E(rx)] for the fluctuation of the DAD is altered. Quantum mechanical tunneling may be particularly sensitive
to the local motions and active site environment (including electrostatics), and rates of catalysis may be compromised
by small changes in protein structures. Perhaps the dynamics are altered
because of increased flexibility (or puckering) in the positioning
of the nicotinamide ring or the insertion of a water near the nicotinamide
ring., Nevertheless, investigations are required
to explain quantitatively the results with the V207A and V203A enzymes,
as discussed in recent reviews.,,

An alternative explanation could be that tunneling is not
actually diminished in the V203A enzyme but rather that kinetic complexity
masks the tunneling, as was suggested for wild-type ADH., This possibility seems unlikely, however, because the primary H/D
isotope effect for catalytic turnover [DV1/Et (Table )] of 3.4 for V203A ADH indicates that hydride transfer is
a major rate-limiting step in catalysis. (Because the temperature
dependence of the isotope effects has not been determined for V203A
ADH, evidence of thermally activated fluctuations of the DAD is not
available.,,) Although tunneling may be diminished in the V203A enzyme, quantum
mechanical tunneling most likely still occurs, as that is an inherent
characteristic of hydrogen transfer and because there are no apparent
structural impediments for attaining a tunneling-ready state in the
enzyme.

A related question is why the apparent rate of transfer
of hydrogen
from benzyl alcohol was decreased by the V203A substitution only from
24 to 1.5 s–1, retaining perhaps most of the catalytic
rate enhancement due to the enzyme, if
tunneling is diminished by a loss of PPV. The contribution of tunneling
to the overall catalytic rate enhancement may be 2–20-fold.,, The enormous remaining catalytic
activity may be attributed to an appropriate active site scaffold,
local environment, and thermal motions that conspire to produce a
reactive state poised for hydride transfer. Our estimates of mean fluctuations for protein and substrates from
analysis of the B factors for both wild-type and
V203A enzymes ranged up to ∼0.5 Å at 300 K. Such fluctuations
suggest that DADs in substrates could approach the 2.7 Å distance
for optimal hydride transfer, although substrates must also be oriented
properly.

In this regard, it is interesting that mixed quantum
mechanical/molecular
dynamics calculations showed that substrate and protein interaction
distances changed by ∼0.6 Å as the reactants proceeded
toward the transition state along the reaction coordinate. Curiously, when the DAD between NAD and alcohol
decreased by 0.6 Å to 2.7 Å, the distance between C4N of
NAD and the CG1 methyl group (labeled CG2 in the current structures)
of Val-203 increased by 0.6 Å to 5.1 Å, as if the nicotinamide
ring loses contact with Val-203. (The V203A substitution eliminates
both methyl groups and thus the contact with C4N, and the distance
between C4N and 203 CA in all of the structures is ∼5.4 Å.)
Motions of other protein atoms were not illustrated, but the simulations
showed that some contacts of the Val-203 side chain in wild-type enzyme
are maintained: Val-203 CG2 to NAD C6N or Val-203 CG1 to Thr-178 CG1.
Some interactions of the nicotinamide ring and the protein in the
structures of wild-type and V203A enzymes are maintained: the side
chain of Thr-178 with C4N, CG1 of Leu-292 with C2N, and the hydrogen
bonds of the carboxamido group to the backbone atoms of residues 292,
317, and 319. Thus, the nicotinamide ring seems to have more restricted
motions than the alcohol does, in accordance with the local B factors. The similarity of B factors
of the ligands and residues 203 and 207 among these structures suggests
that local dynamics are not altered much by the valine to alanine
substitutions.

Understanding enzyme catalysis continues to provide
fundamental
challenges. It appears that further experimental
data and calculations are required to understand the links between
protein dynamics and catalysis and to determine if nonequilibrium
dynamics contribute., A recent theoretical study of
lactate dehydrogenase concluded that the V136A substitution at the
nicotinamide binding site would result in dramatic changes in catalysis
due to effects on PPV, but most studies
of temperature-dependent isotope effects focus on equilibrium motions
and differences in DADs.,, Perhaps PPV contribute to the hydrogen tunneling in optimally evolved
wild-type enzymes,, but the protein scaffold, electrostatics,
and local equilibrium motions may explain most of the enzyme catalysis.

X-ray crystallography can determine some
of the structures of the
ensemble in the protein and within the active site and provide a framework
for understanding the roles of dynamics in catalysis. Molecular dynamics
simulations may provide information about the population of reactive
complexes for complexes of mutated enzymes when starting structures
are available,,, but quantum mechanical calculations are required to correlate rate
constants for hydride transfer with structures. For future computations of the V203A enzyme, the starting
model could be based on the F93W/V203A enzyme (PDB entry 1AXE, 2.0 Å) after
the TFE is replaced with benzyl alcohol, if alternative conformations
of amino acid side chains are not of interest. If the multitude of
conformers, including ∼50 amino acid residues with alternative
conformations identified in the dimeric molecule, are of interest,
the wild-type enzyme (PDB entry 4DWV, 1.14 Å) could be used after Val-203
is mutated in silico to alanine, waters A and B 994
are added in the positions found in the structures of the V203A enzyme,
and fluorines are removed from the PFB.

A general challenge
is to compute the rate constants for hydride
transfer for a range of enzyme variants of ADH and show a correlation
with experimental data. This may be difficult because many of the
site-directed substitutions change the rate constant for hydride transfer
by less than an order of magnitude. Even substitutions (e.g., V292S
and G293A/P295T) that greatly increase steady-state kinetic constants,
decrease the overall catalytic efficiency [V1/(EtKbKia) for alcohol oxidation], and alter
the energetics of the conformational change have modest effects on
the rate constant for hydride transfer., Anticorrelated
motions of the catalytic and coenzyme binding domains that are related
to the relatively slow global conformational change that accompanies
coenzyme binding are suggested to “push” the substrates
in the Michaelis complex toward a reactive state,,, but the contribution to hydride transfer
may be modest. Substitutions of amino acid residues distant from the
nicotinamide binding site also have modest effects on turnover and
catalytic efficiency.,, Local structures and catalysis can be altered by substitutions of
amino acid residues, but the protein scaffold can maintain the constellation
of the many residues participating in catalysis. These considerations
lead us to suggest that once the substrates are bound, local motions
are more important than global motions for the chemistry of hydrogen
transfer.
