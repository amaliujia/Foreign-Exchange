An error has
been found in Table . The exponent for kcat of apo WT-YjiA should be 10–4, not 10–3. This change does not impact any of
the findings in the paper because the conclusions were based on the
reported kcat/Km, which is correct. The revised, corrected table is shown below.

All GTPase
assays were conducted with 0.5–2 μM WT or E37A,C66A,C67A
YjiA in protein buffer supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2. Samples
containing metal were preincubated with either zinc, cobalt, or nickel
overnight at 4 °C in an anaerobic glovebox. The amount of released
phosphate was detected using a modified Malachite Green assay. The
data listed are average values from at least three independent experiments.

WH, weak hydrolysis (see main
text for details).

NH, no
measurable hydrolysis.
