CDP-diacylglycerol
synthases (CDS) are critical enzymes that catalyze
the formation of CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) from phosphatidic acid
(PA). Here we show in vitro that the two isoforms
of human CDS, CDS1 and CDS2, show different acyl chain specificities
for its lipid substrate. CDS2 is selective for the acyl chains at
the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, the
most preferred species being 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-phosphatidic acid. CDS1, conversely, shows no particular substrate
specificity, displaying similar activities for almost all substrates
tested. Additionally, we show that inhibition of CDS2 by phosphatidylinositol
is also acyl chain-dependent, with the strongest inhibition seen with
the 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species. CDS1 shows no acyl chain-dependent
inhibition. Both CDS1 and CDS2 are inhibited by their anionic phospholipid
end products, with phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate showing
the strongest inhibition. Our results indicate that CDS1 and CDS2
could create different CDP-DAG pools that may serve to enrich different
phospholipid species with specific acyl chains.

CDP-DAG synthases (CDS) are enzymes that catalyze the conversion
of phosphatidic
acid (PA) to CDP-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG).1 Both PA and CDP-DAG serve critical roles in cellular
functions. PA is involved in several signal transduction pathways
and also plays structural and biosynthetic roles. For example, PA
has been shown to modulate several proteins, including phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase,
protein phosphatase 1, and mammalian target of rapamycin.2−4 In addition, PA is a highly fusogenic lipid involved in the generation
of negative curvature in transport complexes, such as vesicles.5 PA can also be dephosphorylated to diacylglycerol,
which
is a precursor to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine
(PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS).6,7 Conversely,
CDP-DAG is a lipid precursor to several
phospholipid classes such as phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylglycerol
(PG), and cardiolipin (CL).6

Only
two CDS isoforms in mammals have been identified and characterized.
Both these isoforms are believed to be localized to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER).8−11 It was believed that CDS1 was present in mitochondria for synthesizing
cardiolipin.12 However, a recent study
using yeast has shown
that the
enzyme Tam 41 is responsible for this activity and that CDS1 does
not reside in the mitochondria, although its presence may affect mitochondrial
lipid composition.13,14 CDS1 and CDS2 are expressed in
a variety of tissues.
In mice, CDS1 is found in adult brain, eye, smooth muscle, and testis.
In the eyes, CDS1 is strongly expressed in the photoreceptor layer
of adult retinas, which could suggest a role for CDS1 in phototransduction.11 CDS2 has a broad expression pattern and was
found in
virtually every tissue;10 however, some
discrepancies exist in the tissue localization
of CDS2. For example, another study showed that an arachidonoyl-preferring
CDS (CDS2 based on our results) was expressed only in the brain, eye,
and testis.9,10

The roles of CDS1 and CDS2
have primarily been studied in PI synthesis.15 Many of the cellular functions attributed to CDS enzymes
are believed to result from their role in generating the precursor
for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a potent
signaling
molecule. For example, phototransduction signaling in vertebrate and
invertebrate systems is believed to proceed, at
least partly, via phosphoinositide signaling.16,17cds mutants in Drosophila result
in light-induced retinal degradation, and overexpression of a photoreceptor
specific CDS increases the amplitude of the light response.1 Disruption of CDS2 led to a decrease in the level
of
VEGFA signaling and angiogenesis in zebrafish, primarily through a
decreased level
of PIP2 regeneration.18 A similar
but weaker effect was seen when CDS1 was disrupted,
whereas knockdown of both isoforms led to embryonic lethality.18 An arachidonoyl-preferring CDS was also shown
to be
inhibited by PI species, specifically PIP2.9 This suggests a potential feedback mechanism, in which
CDS activity is highest when phosphoinositide [PI(P)n] levels are low. Apart from PI signaling, CDS1 was also shown
to be involved in the maintenance of phospholipids
critical for mitochondrial function and structure.14

In this study, we use in vitro assays
to characterize
both human isoforms of CDS, i.e., CDS1 and CDS2. CDS2 exhibits specificity
for the nature of the
acyl chains in the substrate, PA. The preferred acyl chain composition
is 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl. This is also the acyl chain composition
most highly enriched in PI.19−21 Inhibition of CDS2 is also acyl
chain specific, with
1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl PI species showing the strongest inhibition.
CDS1 in contrast shows virtually no substrate specificity or acyl
chain-dependent PI inhibition. Taken together, our results point toward
the generation of specific pools of CDP-DAG for phospholipid synthesis
by the two different CDS isoforms.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar
Lipids and were stored in a solution containing a 2/1 (v/v) CHCl3/CH3OH mixture and 0.1% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT). The acyl chain compositions of the preparations of natural
lipids purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids are available from the manufacturer.
All traces of the solvent phase were evaporated using N2 gas, and remaining traces of solvent were removed using a vacuum
desiccator for 2 h. The lipid films were then stored under argon gas
for stability.
Most other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless
otherwise noted. All lipids used in this study are summarized in Table 1, together with the abbreviations used. The CDS1
and CDS2 DNA constructs used were tagged at their C-termini with a
myc epitope
tag as described in ref (8). The naturally
derived phospholipid species used in this study are listed in Table 2.

Cell Culture
and Tranfections
COS7 cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (GIBCO)
and supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (GIBCO) and 1/100 (v/v) Pen/Strep (GIBCO). Cells were
maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transfections,
cells were grown to 90%
confluency in four plates per assay and tranfected with 8 μg
of plasmid DNA per plate using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h, cells
were harvested by being scraped into a solution of PBS with
a 1/100 (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail. Cells were spun at 1000g for 5 min, and the pellets were flash-frozen at −80
°C.

Enzyme Preparation for the CDS Activity Assay
Cell
pellets containing transfected constructs were resuspended in an ice-cold
lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM KCl,
0.2 mM ethylene glycol
tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 1/100 (v/v) protease inhibitor
cocktail] for use with mammalian cell and tissue extracts (Sigma-Aldrich).
The cells were broken by 30 passes through a 25-gauge needle syringe.
Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed from the cell homogenate by
centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min at 4 °C.
Resuspended cells were centrifuged at 100000g for
60 min at 4 °C. The microsomal fraction (pellet) was resuspended
in lysis buffer and used for the mixed micelle-based enzymatic activity
assay. Further attempts to purify the enzyme through binding to affinity
resins for the epitope tag resulted in a pure enzyme preparation.
However, enzymatic activity was not retained in the mixed micelle
assay, regardless of the methods used to obtain an active enzyme.23

Detergent/Phospholipid/Mixed Micelle-Based
Enzymatic Activity
Assay
Lipid films were prepared by solvent evaporation from
a chloroform/methanol solution of the lipids. For kinetic experiments,
SAPA was used at
concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 400 μM.
For substrate specificity assays, the desired
PA species was used at a concentration of 50 μM (∼1 mol
%). For CDS1 and CDS2 inhibition experiments, SAPA and PI species
each at 50 μM were used. Lipid films were suspended in 166 μL
of assay buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM KCl, 2 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin (BSA), 100 mM guanosine triphosphate (GTP),
and 5.10 mM Triton X-100] by vortexing for 2 min. GTP was added because
it was found to increase the rate of reaction
(see below). We also replaced BSA with the non-lipid binding protein,
ovalbumin. This change in protein did not affect
CDS activity, indicating that the assay was not perturbed by the lipid
binding properties of BSA. Once the films were resuspended, 4 μL
of 1 M MgCl2 was added to reach a final volume of 170 μL.
Supernatants from CDS-transfected cells were added to the mixed
micelles to a final volume of 180 μL. The reaction was initiated
by adding 20 μL of 0.2 mM CTP (cytidine 5′-[5′-3H]triphosphate,
2.5 μCi/sample) and the mixture incubated at room temperature
for 5 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 500 μL of stop
solution (0.1 N HCl in methanol). The organic phase was
washed with 300 μL of 0.6 N HCl and 1 mL of chloroform. The
solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 2 min, and the organic phase
was transferred to a new tube. The organic
phase was washed with 1 mL of an ice-cold “upper
phase” solution obtained from a mixture of 0.1
N HCl in a methanol/aqueous 0.6 N HCl/chloroform mixture [10/6/20
(v/v/v)]; 500 μL of the organic phase was used to determine
the level of incorporation
of 3H into PA to form CDP-DAG. The organic phase was evaporated,
and the samples were read using UltimaGoldF (PerkinElmer). The data
from these assays are presented as the mean ± the
standard deviation (SD). To account for endogenous levels of CDS1
and CDS2 and background activity, lysates with mock-transfected COS7
cells (empty vector) were used as a negative control, after normalizing
for the calnexin content. The mock-transfected lysates were included
with each activity assay and had roughly 5–15% of the activity,
depending on the experiment, that was found with
CDS-transfected constructs.

Kinetic Analysis of CDS Activity
To determine Vmax and Km parameters,
activity assays were performed using various concentrations of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-phosphatidic acid (SAPA) and 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-phosphatidic acid (SLPA). Vmax and Km parameters
were determined using nonlinear regression analysis by plotting initial
enzyme velocity (vo) versus substrate
concentration ([S]). Previous studies have shown that the addition
of GTP lowered the apparent Km of PA.12 We found a small stimulation of both isoforms
with 2
mM GTP (data not shown); thus, GTP was added to all reaction mixtures.
Data were analyzed using Origin8.

Quantification of Phosphatidic
Acid
The concentration
of all PA stocks used in this study was determined using their phosphate
content. Briefly, 30 μL of 10% (w/v) Mg(NO3)2 in 95% (v/v) ethanol
was added to PA samples or KH2PO4 standards
(up to 80 nmol) in acid-washed Pyrex tubes. The solution was flamed
until the organic phosphate was completely ashed; 350 μL of
0.5 M HCl was added, the mixture refluxed for 15 min, and 750 μL
of a 1/6 (v/v) mixture of 10% (w/v) l-ascorbic
acid and 0.42% (w/v) ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate in 0.5 M H2SO4 added. The mixture was incubated at 60
°C for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature, and the
absorbance at 820 nm was measured.

Immunoblot Analysis
Immunoblotting was used to quantify
the amount of protein from transfected COS7 cells. Samples were prepared
by mixing an equal volume of lysate and Laemmli sample buffer [60
mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol,
and 0.01% bromophenol blue] and kept at 60 °C for 5 min. The
samples were run on a 7.5% Tris-glycine sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel for 30 min at
200
V. The proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Bio-Rad). The antibody used to detect the myc epitope tag
on CDS constructs was a mouse anti-myc antibody (Cell Signaling).
The antibody used to detect calnexin was the mouse anti-calnexin antibody
(BD Biosciences). The secondary antibody used was the horseradish
peroxidise (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma). The
immunoblot was detected using ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare) on XAR Biofilm (Kodak).
To determine the amount of CDS1/2-myc in each of the lanes, a known
amount of a recombinant myc-tagged control protein (MYC11-C, Alpha
Diagnostics International, San Antonio, TX) was run along with the
samples.

CDS Immunostaining
For immunostaining, cells were plated
on 25 mm glass coverslips for 24 h and cotransfected with 0.3 μg
of CDS1-GFP and CDS2-myc (or CDS2-GFP and CDS1-myc), each for 24 h.
Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and 0.4% glutaraldehyde for 10 min. After being washed
with PBS three times, cells were quenched with 1% freshly made sodium
borohydrate (5 min) and washed thoroughly four times. The first antibody
(1/300 of mouse anti-myc or rabbit anti-GFP) incubations were then
performed in PBS containing
0.4% BSA and 0.2% saponin (1 h) followed by washing and incubation
with Alexa488 or Alexa568 second antibodies (1/1000) for 30 min. After
several washes,
coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G and the cells observed
with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Note that this procedure
eliminates GFP fluorescence, so it was detected by immunostaining
and in some cases visualized with a red-colored secondary antibody.

Statistical Analysis
Where necessary, statistical analysis
was performed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests
followed by Tukey’s test. Analysis was performed using Origin
Pro 8. Experiments were
repeated at least three times independently in triplicate. Data are
presented as the mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM).

Results
Validation of the Assay
Because both the substrate
PA and the enzyme, CDS, are membrane-bound, we expect the enzyme to
follow surface dilution kinetics.22,23 We indeed
find that both CDS1 and CDS2 follow surface
dilution kinetics at higher concentrations of Triton. Maximal activity
is found at 5.1 mM Triton X-100 (Figure 1A,B).
Both CDS1 and CDS2 are expressed well and show a significant increase
in the level of incorporation of 3H over empty vector (EV)-transfected
mock controls (Figure 1C). These results demonstrate
that although
we were unable to purify the enzyme in its active form, the enzymatic
activity we measure is a property of the overexpressed CDS isoform
with little contribution from endogenous enzyme activity.
Additionally, both isoforms require exogenously added PA to show any
significant activities over EV samples (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we also show (see Figure 3F) that even adding a PA that is a poor substrate
for CDS2 does not result in 3H incorporation. The initial
rate of formation of product is linear with time over 10 min, and
an increase in the rate of CDP-DG formation is seen after 60 min (not
shown). For comparison of reactions, we use a standard incubation
time of 5 min. Hence, the observed reaction is dependent on excess
CDS expression,
and in comparison, the endogenous activity is negligible. In addition,
there are no other reactions causing the incorporation of cytidine
into a lipid-soluble product because the reaction requires the presence
of a substrate PA and the product formed is stable over a longer period
of time.

The presence of 2 mM
GTP resulted in a small
stimulation of both CDS1 and CDS2 and was therefore added as a component
of our assay (data not shown). The addition of inorganic pyrophosphate,
one of the products of the CDS reaction, could slow the rate by shifting
the position of the equilibrium. However, we found no significant
effect of pyrophosphate on activity (data not shown), suggesting that
the position of equilibrium was far toward the production of the product
CDP-DAG.

CDS1 and CDS2 Show Different Substrate Specificities
We first determined the specific activities and kinetic parameters
of CDS1 and CDS2. The specific activities of CDS1 and CDS2 were determined
to be 2.4 ± 0.2 and 4.5 ± 0.2 μmol of CDP-DAG min–1 mg–1, respectively,
for the substrate SAPA at 1 mol % (Figure 1D). The activities were normalized to both the amount of CDS1/CDS2-myc
and calnexin levels (Figure 1E). Interestingly,
there is a large difference in substrate acyl chain specificity between
CDS1 and CDS2. Whereas CDS1 shows no significant preference between
substrates SAPA and SLPA, CDS2 shows a roughly ∼4-fold increase
in its preference for SAPA over SLPA (Figure 1D).

We then determined the kinetic parameters of CDS1 and CDS2
for SAPA and SLPA. CDS1 and CDS2 show typical saturation kinetics
(Figure 2A,B), and the kinetic parameters are
summarized in Table 3. CDS1 has Vmax values of 3.3 ± 0.3 and 3.6 ±
0.1 μmol of CDP-DG min–1 mg–1 for SAPA
and SLPA, respectively. Conversely, CDS2 has Vmax values of 9.3 ± 0.4 and 3.5 ±
0.1 μmol of CDP-DG min–1 mg–1 for SAPA
and SLPA, respectively. For comparison, these are very similar values
compared to those obtained using a purified, yeast CDS enzyme.23 CDS1 shows no significant changes in kcat/Km for SAPA
and SLPA. Conversely, CDS2 has a significantly higher kcat/Km for SAPA
than for SLPA (Table 3). Because there is an
intrinsically
high error in Km, to further confirm differences
in substrate specificities, we determined the activities of both enzymes
at 0.1 mol % SAPA and SLPA. For enzymes that follow Michaelis–Menten
kinetics, at [S] ≪ Km, the rate
should follow first-order
kinetics with activities being proportional to kcat/Km. As shown
in Figure 2C, whereas CDS1 shows no significant
differences in substrate specificity, CDS2 shows significantly higher
activities for SAPA.

a A mixed micelle assay was used
to test enzymatic activity over a series of substrate concentrations.
Substrate concentrations are represented as mole percent SAPA. The
low enzymatic activity from EV-myc is subtracted, and the activity
is then normalized using calnexin. Data are represented as the mean
± SEM. The kcat/Km of CDS2 for SAPA is significantly greater than that
of SLPA, whereas the kcat/Km values of CDS1 for SAPA and SLPA are not.

b Determined to be statistically
different from the value for SAPA (P &lt; 0.05).

We further tested the substrate
specificities
of CDS1 and CDS2 for PA substrates with a variety of acyl chains (Table 1). CDS1 and CDS2 show very different substrate specificities
(Figure 3). CDS1
appears to have no substrate preference for SAPA, with variations
of the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains
resulting in no significant changes in preference compared with that
for SAPA. CDS1 showed decreased specificity only toward DOPA over
the other substrates tested. However, CDS1 showed similar
activity toward another PA with variations at the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chains (SAPA vs DLPA) (Figure 3C).

Figure 3 Substrate specificity of CDS1 and CDS2. A mixed micelle
assay was
used to test enzymatic activity using a variety of substrates. PA
concentrations were quantified prior to use, and 1 mol % substrates
(50 μM) were used for each assay. The substrate specificity
of CDS1 was measured by varying the (A) sn-1,
(B) sn-2, and (C) sn-1/sn-2 acyl chains. The substrate specificity of CDS2 was
measured by varying the (D) sn-1, (E) sn-2, and (F) sn-1/sn-2 acyl chains.
The bars with asterisks were determined to be statistically different
(P &lt; 0.05). Data are represented as the mean ±
SEM. The activities of CDS1 and CDS2 are 164.4 ± 4.6 and 289.8
± 12.8 pmol of CDP-DG/min, respectively, and are defined as 100%
for SAPA.

Conversely, CDS2 showed substrate
specificity at both the sn-1 and sn-2 acyl chain positions. The
most preferred substrate is SAPA. Substitutions of the sn-1 stearoyl group with an arachidonoyl acyl chain resulted in a &gt;50%
loss of activity (Figure 3D). Even similar
substitutions at the sn-1 position [stearoyl (18:0)
vs
palmitoyl (16:0)] resulted in a significant loss of activity (Figure 3D). PA with differing acyl chains at the sn-2 position or both sn-1 and sn-2 positions showed an even greater loss of activity than
at the sn-1 position alone. Any substitution at the sn-2 arachidonoyl position resulted in activities that were
approximately 10–20% of the activity against SAPA (Figure 3E).
DLPA, which varies at both acyl chain positions, was the only PA in
this group with activity (Figure 3F). DOPA
showed virtually no activity with
CDS2 (Figure 3F). In contrast, DOPA had roughly
75–80%
of the activity of SAPA for CDS1, which shows the striking difference
in substrate specificities between these two isoforms.

Subcellular
Localization of CDS1 and CDS2
Because CDS1 and CDS2 show
substantially different substrate specificities, we decided to see
whether there are differences in the localizations of the two isoforms.
First, we tested whether the GFP tag affects substrate specificity.
Both CDS1-GFP and CDS2-GFP show substrate specificities similar to
those of their myc-tagged counterparts. CDS1-GFP shows similar activities
for both SAPA and SLPA, whereas CDS2-GFP shows a marked preference
for SAPA (Figure 4A). Previous studies showed
that GFP-tagged CDS1 and CDS2 showed a typical ER tubular localization
when they were expressed in COS7 cells.8 To make a more thorough comparison between the localization
of the two proteins, we co-expressed the GFP-tagged and myc-tagged
forms of the two enzymes and studied
their colocalization after fixation and immunostaining. We used cells
expressing the smallest
detectable amounts of the proteins to best approximate the endogenous
distribution. We also conducted these experiments in two ways, using
CDS1-GFP together with CDS2-myc and CDS2-GFP with CDS1-myc to rule
out the potential effect of GFP on the localization. These studies
confirmed that both CDS forms localized to the ER. There were only
subtle but notable differences between the distributions of the two
proteins. These included a more pronounced enrichment of the CDS1
enzyme in the pericentriolar central ER and the enrichment of the
CDS2 enzyme in ER sheets relative to the tubular ER (Figure 4B). However, these differences were only relative,
as both enzymes could be found in all ER areas. Because of the lack
of antibodies suitable for the detection of the endogenous proteins,
these are the best data available as yet for the relative localizations
of these proteins.

where the GFP is detected with a red secondary antibody (the GFP fluorescence
is quenched by our fixation procedure that preserves the ER architecture).
Both CDS forms are ER-localized with only subtle differences: CDS1
being more enriched in the central ER and CDS2 being slightly more
prevalent in peripheral ER sheets. The activities of CDS1 and CDS2
are 156.9 ± 15.7 and 202.6 ± 4.2 pmol of CDP-DG/min, respectively,
and are defined as 100% for SAPA.

CDS1 and CDS2 Show Inhibition by Natural Phospholipid Species
We next decided to test whether CDS1 and CDS2 show inhibition by
physiologically relevant PI species (Figure 5). An equimolar amount of these lipids (1 mol %) was chosen as PA.
Both CDS1 and CDS2 show inhibition by PI species,
with PIP2 showing the strongest inhibition. CDS1 shows
no significant inhibition in activity when either soybean or liver
PI is used at equimolar concentrations with respect to SAPA (Figure 5A). In the endoplasmic reticulum of resting
macrophages, there is roughly 5 times more PI than PA.24 CDS1 is significantly inhibited by PIP (25%
inhibition)
and even more by PIP2 (40% inhibition) (Figure 5A). CDS2 also shows inhibition by PI species, but
to an extent greater than that of CDS1 (Figure 5C). There is a significant inhibition of CDS2 by both soybean and
liver PI (15–20% activity). Addition of 1 mol % PIP and PIP2 to the reaction mixture resulted in 55 and
80% inhibition of CDS2, as compared to the case without PI species
(Figure 5C).

Figure 5 Inhibition of CDS1 and CDS2 by natural
phospholipid species.
A
mixed micelle assay was used to determine the inhibition of CDS1 and
CDS2 with naturally derived PI and PG species. An equal mole percent
of phospholipids was used as the substrate PA, unless otherwise noted.
The concentration of all lipid species was quantified prior to use.
Black bars represent the presence of the substrate, SAPA, only. Other
bars represent the same concentration of SAPA together with a second
lipid of equimolar or 4-fold higher concentration, as indicated on
the graph: (A) PI inhibition of CDS1, (B) PG inhibition of CDS1, (C)
PI inhibition of CDS2, and (D) PG inhibition of CDS2. The bars with
asterisks were determined to be statistically different (P &lt; 0.05). Data are represented as the mean ± SEM. The activities
of CDS1 and CDS2 are 176.9 ± 22.6 and 231.6 ± 6.7 pmol of
CDP-DG/min, respectively, and are defined as 100% for SAPA.

Like PI(P)n, PG is
also a phospholipid end product of CDS; therefore, we decided to examine
the effect of PG on both CDS isoforms. Neither soy nor egg PG had
any significant effect on either CDS1 (Figure 5B) or CDS2 (Figure 5D) when an equal mole
percent of these species to PA was used. However, when a higher concentration
of PG was added, significant inhibition of both CDS isoforms was observed.
The PG/PA ratio in the endoplasmic reticulum of macrophages is ∼30.24 Therefore, inhibition by PG would be physiologically
significant.

Inhibition of CDS2 Is Acyl Chain-Dependent,
but That of CDS1
Is Not
The difference in inhibition of CDS1 and CDS2 suggested
that the acyl chain composition of the PI species plays a role in
the inhibition of these enzymes. We chose PI species, primarily because
of the limited variability of the acyl chain composition of commercially
available synthetic, more inhibitory PIP and PIP2 species.
CDS1 shows no acyl chain-dependent inhibition for SAPI, SLPI, or DLPI
(Figure 6A). The lack of acyl chain-dependent
inhibition is similar to its substrate specificity (Figure 3A–C). CDS2, meanwhile, does show acyl chain-dependent
inhibition, with SAPI showing the strongest inhibition (80% inhibition).
DLPI also showed a statistically significant inhibition (20%), whereas
the inhibition by SLPI was not significant (Figure 6B). As with CDS1, this acyl chain-dependent inhibition of
CDS2 is also reflective of the enzyme’s substrate specificity
(Figure 3D–F)

Figure 6 Inhibition of CDS1 and
CDS2 by PI and PG species. A mixed micelle
assay was used to determine the inhibition of CDS1 and CDS2 with select
PI and PG species. The concentrations of all species were quantified
prior to use. The activity as compared to EV controls: (A) CDS1 and
(B) CDS2. The bars with asterisks were determined to be statistically
different (P &lt; 0.05). Data are represented as
the mean ± SEM. The activities of CDS1 and CDS2 are 88.9 ±
3.7 and 160.4 ± 10.8 pmol of CDP-DG/min, respectively, and are
defined as 100% for SAPA.

Discussion
Several phospholipid classes show enrichment
with specific acyl
chains. PI, for example, has been shown to have 40–70% of species
with 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl acyl chains.19,20 Conversely, PG is enriched with oleoyl (18:1) and linoleoyl
(18:2) acyl chains, and cardiolipin in heart mitochondria is enriched
predominantly with linoleoyl acyl chains.25,26 CDS1 and CDS2 supply precursors to several phospholipids,
such as PI, PG, and cardiolipin. As such, these enzymes can contribute
to the enrichment of phospholipids with specific acyl chains by showing
substrate specificity.

We have shown that CDS1 and CDS2 show
very different substrate
specificities. CDS1 exhibits almost no acyl chain preference for PA,
showing no discrimination for the sn-1/sn-2 acyl chain composition of PAs. CDS1 shows a weaker preference
for only DOPA; however, this PA species is not physiologically abundant.
Conversely, CDS2 shows substrate specificity at both the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. The most preferred substrate
is SAPA, a form of PA having the acyl composition most enriched in
PI species. Variations at the sn-1 position, even
to similar acyl chains (e.g., stearoyl vs palmitoyl), resulted in
a roughly 40% loss of activity (Figure 3D).
CDS2 showed even less preference for
substrates with an sn-1 stearoyl acyl chain but a
different acyl chain at the sn-2 position (Figure 3E). CDS2 shows only 10–20% activity for these
PA’s,
when compared to SAPA. Our results suggest that CDS2 is selective
for both acyl chains of PA, which is similar to the acyl chain selectivity
of another enzyme involved in PI synthesis, DGKε.27−29 Like DGKε, the arachidonoyl acyl chain at the sn-2 position is critical for the enzyme’s substrate specificity.28 Changes at the sn-1 position
also play
a role in the enzyme’s preference for its substrate.29 However, CDS2 appears to be even more selective
for
its substrates than DGKε. For example, CDS2 shows 60 and 30%
activity for PAPA and DAPA, respectively, whereas DGKε shows
roughly 90 and 70% activity for 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl glycerol
and diarachidonoyl glycerol, respectively.

While CDS1 and CDS2
show inhibition by PI species, the extent of
inhibition and acyl chain dependence differ between these two isoforms.
Inhibition of both isoforms is seen by its lipid end product, with
PIP2 species showing the strongest inhibition. However,
CDS2 shows different extents of inhibition by different PI species.
This suggests that the acyl chain composition of the PI species plays
a role in the inhibition. As shown in Figure 6, this idea is supported; whereas CDS1 shows no acyl chain dependence
among the three PI species, CDS2 shows the strongest inhibition for
SAPI.

If either CDS1 or CDS2 can be used for PI synthesis, how
could
they contribute to acyl chain enrichment? Studies have shown that
PI synthesis can occur through two pathways, both of which generate
different species: the de novo synthesis pathway
and the PI cycle.30 The de novo synthesis of PI involves
only the ER and generates mainly saturated and monounsaturated acyl
chains.20,31,32 The PI cycle
is a cyclical pathway
that involves the
breakdown and regeneration of PIP2.33 The PI cycle involves both the ER and PM and results
in the enrichment of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species.28,34 Both pathways involve common features, one of which
is the conversion of PA species to CDP-DAG by CDS enzymes. It appears
likely that CDS2 would be involved in the PI cycle.

The acyl
chain selectivity of CDS2 is similar to that of DGKε,
which was shown to be required for the arachidonoyl enrichment of
PI species. CDS2 could play a similar yet greater role in the enrichment
of PI with an arachidonoyl chain. CDP-DAG produced by CDS2 can be
used only for the synthesis of phospholipids. Conversely, PA synthesized
by DGKε can be used for signal transduction pathways and, structurally,
for phospholipid synthesis and can be dephosphorylated back to diacylglycerol
by phosphatidic acid phosphatase.6 In contrast,
the step in the PI cycle catalyzed by CDS
is essentially irreversible because one of the products is pyrophosphate
that is rapidly hydrolyzed by pyrophosphatase, preventing the reversal
of this step. Both DGKε and CDS2 are needed for the first steps
of PIP2 synthesis, and both of these enzymes can supply
precursors enriched with arachidonoyl acyl chains. The cyclical nature
of the PI cycle suggests a progressive enrichment of PI species with
an arachidonoyl chain. Both DGKε and CDS2 are strongly expressed
in certain organs, such as brain, and so could contribute to particularly
high levels of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl species in these organs.
