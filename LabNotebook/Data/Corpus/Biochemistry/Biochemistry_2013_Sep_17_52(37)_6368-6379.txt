The catalytic (C) subunit of
cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a Ser/Thr kinase that mediates
many cAMP signaling functions. At low
concentrations of cAMP, PKA exists as a heterotetrameric holoenzyme
composed of an R-subunit homodimer that binds and inactivates two
C-subunit monomers. At high concentrations,
cAMP binds to the R-subunit dimer to induce a conformational change
that reduces the affinity of the R-subunit toward the C-subunit and
leads to C-subunit activation. The C-subunit
has served as an important model for the protein kinase family not
only because it was the first kinase whose structure was solved but also because its regulatory component is
separate from its catalytic component, and therefore, it can be studied
independently.

Protein kinase structures include a bilobal structure
comprised
of the N-lobe (or small lobe) and C-lobe (or large lobe). ATP binds in the cleft formed between these lobes,
thereby coupling them., Crystal structures of the C-subunit
of PKA reveal multiple conformations of the enzyme termed “open”,
“closed”, and “intermediate” on the basis
of the relative orientations of the small and large lobes with respect
to each other. The open conformation is
typically observed with the apo C-subunit., The
closed conformation is typically observed when nucleotide and IP20
are crystallized with the protein,, and the intermediate
conformation is observed when the C-subunit is crystallized with adenosine
alone. The C-subunit is regulated by
noncovalent ligand and protein binding as well as covalent co- and
post-translational modifications. For example, the N-terminus undergoes
cotranslational N-myristylation of Gly1, phosphorylation of Ser10,
and deamidation of Asn2, which may regulate
C-subunit interaction with membranes or subcellular sites.− Additionally, N-myristylation increases the structural stability
globally and locally near the myristylation
site.−

To further assess how myristylation and ligand
binding influence
C-subunit dynamics, a combination of time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy
and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was utilized. Specifically,
five single-site cysteine-substitution C-subunit mutants were engineered
and conjugated with fluorescein maleimide (FM). The cysteine mutations
were placed along the A-helix at the N-terminus of the protein (K7C
and K16C) near the myristate pocket (N99C), and at the C-tail (S325C
and native C343) (Figure A–C). Additionally,
the mutants were prepared in both myristylated and nonmyristylated
configurations, and the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements
were performed in the absence of ligands (apo/open state) and in the
presence of ATP plus IP20 (ternary/closed state). Parallel molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the myristylated and nonmyristylated
C-subunit in the presence and absence of ligands with a recent crystal
structure of the N-myristylated protein. These fluorescence and MD experiments identified a stabilizing effect
of myristylation at the N-terminus and myristate pocket and identified
long-range allosteric effects of this modification and ligand binding.

Experimental Procedures
Purification of the C-Subunit Proteins
All mutations
were generated using a Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The
K7C and K16C mutations were introduced into the WT C-subunit vector.
The N99C and S325C mutations were introduced into vectors containing
a C199A mutation. Finally, the C199A mutation was introduced into
the WT vector so that the endogenous C343 could be selectively labeled.
The nonmyristylated C-subunit was expressed and purified as described
previously. The myristylated C-subunit
was prepared by coexpression with yeast NMT as described previously and purified using a protocol described previously. Three of these mutations, K7C, K16C, and C199A
were characterized previously and shown not to negatively affect C-subunit
activity,, and the activity of the other mutants, N99C
and S325C, were tested with a spectrophotometric assay as described
by Cook et al. with the soluble substrate kemptide (LRRASLG), which
showed similar levels of activity as the WT protein (data not shown),
suggesting that the mutations did not alter normal C-subunit function.

Fluorescein Maleimide Labeling
The
C-subunit samples
(12.5–25 nmol) were initially buffer exchanged by elution through
a PD10 column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated
with 20 mM MOPS and 150 mM KCl, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. The protein
fractions were pooled, and the concentrations of the pooled samples
were determined by spectrophotometry using an A280 extinction coefficient of 45 000 M–1 cm–1 and ranged between 3 and 6 μM. With
the exception of the C199A mutant labeling, the reaction mixtures
were made with 4 mM ATP and 8 mM MgCl2 to protect from
labeling the endogenous cysteine residues (C199 and C343) because
it was previously shown that the presence of MgATP prevents labeling
of these native cysteine residues in PKA. For the N-terminal mutants, the stoichiometry of FM to protein was
2:1, and for the C199A mutants, it was 3:1. The reactions were allowed
to proceed for 1 h at room temperature, protected from light, and
then eluted through a PD10 column equilibrated with 20 mM MOPS, 150
mM KCl, and 5 mM β-ME, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Absorbance measurements
at 280 and 495 nm were made on each column fraction, and the light
absorbing fractions with retention times that corresponded to unmodified
catalytic subunit were pooled. The concentration of labeled protein
was determined by spectrophotometry using an A495 extinction coefficient of 65 000 M–1 cm–1, and the concentration of total protein (labeled
and unlabeled) was calculated with the expression

Time-Resolved Fluorescence
Anisotropy
Emission anisotropy
was determined as previously described. Samples were excited by using a 484 nm laser diode from HORIBA Jobin
Yvon Inc. (Edison, New Jersey, NJ) and a Semrock Inc. (Rochester,
NY) single-band bandpass filter (FF01-482/35-25) in the excitation
pathway to enhance its monochromaticity. A Semrock Inc. single-band
bandpass filter (FF01-536/40-25) selected the emission and rotatable
Glan–Thompson polarizers were placed in the excitation and
emission pathways. Unless stated otherwise, emission anisotropy decays
were analyzed with the impulse reconvolution method implemented in
the DAS6 software package from HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc. (Edison New
Jersey NJ) described elsewhere. Briefly
and simply, this approach splits the analysis into two steps: analysis
of the total emission decay, S(t), from the vertically, I||(t), and orthogonally, I⊥(t), polarized emission components followed by analysis of
the vertical/perpendicular difference emission decay, D(t). S(t) is the
sum of the three axes of emission and is free of anisotropy effects.
It is given by the expressionand is analyzed as a biexponential
function. G is a measure of the instrumental polarization
bias for
each sample, and the values ranged between 0.97 and 0.995 depending
on the instrument configuration. D(t), which includes both fluorescence and anisotropy parameters, is
given by the expressionD(t) is
deconvolved with the results from the S(t) analysis as a constraint yieldingwhere r(t) is the
time-dependent anisotropy.

Here, β1 and β2 are the amplitudes of the anisotropy at
time zero for the fast and slow anisotropy decay processes, respectively.
Φfast and Φslow are the fast and
slow rotational correlation times of the anisotropy decay, respectively.
Φslow usually yields an estimate of the whole-body
rotational correlation time when it is less than about five times
the emission lifetime, and when the rate of the segmental motions
around the site of reporter group conjugation differs greatly from
the rate of the whole-body diffusion. The accuracy of this estimate
increases with the proportion of the total decay that is associated
with the slow decay processes. A nonassociative model was assumed,
where the emission relaxation times are common to all the rotational
correlation times. Goodness of fit was evaluated from the values of
the reduced χ2r and by visual inspection
of the weighted-residual plots. All time-resolved anisotropy measurements
were performed with samples suspended in 20 mM MOPS, 150 mM KCl, and
5 mM β-ME, pH 7.0, at 22 °C.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
System
Preparation
Four unique systems were set up
based on the X-ray refined structure with PDB ID 4DFX. The four systems are defined to have the following configurations:
a myristylated N-termini with ATP and SP20 bound, nonmyristylated
N-termini with ATP and SP20 bound, myristylated N-termini without
ATP and SP20 bound, and nonmyristylated N-termini without ATP and
SP20 bound. The myristylated glycine was prepared by first geometry
optimizing with Gaussian (g03), with
B3LYP and the 6-31G(d) basis set. Electrostatic potential fits were
obtained from Gaussian using the geometry optimized structure and
Hartree–Fock level of theory with the 6-31G* basis set. The
Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) module within the Antechamber
program in AmberTools, was used to assign charges to
the atoms using the Gaussian output. The H++ web-server was used to predict the protonation state of
the residues in the structure at a pH of 7. Only one histidine residue
had a particularly low pKa in PKA and
was modified to be a charged HIP residue. Other histidines were designated
as either HIE or HID (with the ϵ or δ nitrogen protonated,
respectively) by evaluating the local environments of each side chain
in the crystal structure.

Molecular Dynamics Details
Solvation
and Equilibration
The systems were prepared
using the AMBER ff99SB force field, with
the ildn modification for Ile, Leu, Asp, and Asn residues. Each system was solvated in a 10.0 Å TIP3P
box, and sodium ions were added to neutralize the charge. Systems
were heated to 300 K at constant volume (NVT) with
restraints on the protein that were gradually reduced from 200 to
0 kcal/(mol Å2) over a period of 150 ps. The langevin
thermostat was used with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps–1. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain
bonds to nonpolar hydrogens, and a 2.0 fs time-step was used during
dynamics. A 10.0 Å cutoff was used for nonbonded interactions
and the Particle Mesh Ewald method was
used for calculation of long-range electrostatics. Equilibration runs
(100 ps) were done in the NPT ensemble using isotropic
pressure scaling and a pressure relaxation time of 2.0 ps.

Production
Simulations
For each system, six independent
simulations were started from different snapshots from the equilibration
simulations (taken at arbitrary intervals after the density of the
water box was equilibrated) with randomized velocities. All production
runs were conducted in the same NVT conditions as
equilibration. All simulations were performed using the PMEMD module
within the Amber11 and 12 simulation packages.,, Production runs, each 150 ns in length,
were performed on GTX580 GPUs using the pmemd.CUDA engine.−

Results
Myristylation Stabilizes
the Most N-Terminal Residues of the
C-Subunit
Focusing first on the N-terminal dynamics of the
C-subunit, the anisotropy decay results with the FM-K7C and FM-K16C
conjugates, with and without N-terminal myristylation, are illustrated
in Figure  panels A and B, and the decay parameters
are summarized in Table . Myristylation was
only associated with large effects on the anisotropy decay of FM-K7C,
where myristylation increased the β2 parameter (amplitude
of slower decay processes) from 0.092 to 0.142 in the apo state and
from 0.103 to 0.157 in the ternary state (Table , Figure A), suggesting a significant reduction
in the angular excursion of the reporter, which is consistent with
the myristyl moiety binding to the hydrophobic pocket in the core
of the C-subunit observed in the crystal structure. Myristylation
produced a small increase in the anisotropy decay of FM-K16C, as evidenced
by a reduction of the β2 parameter from 0.201 to
0.185 in the apo state and from 0.185 to 0.174 in the ternary state
(Figure B, Table ).
There were modest changes in the decay parameters at the K7C and K16C
sites upon formation of a ternary complex that are likely not significant.
Still, ligand binding and closed state formation caused a slight decrease
in mobility near the K7C site on the basis of increases in the β2 parameter from 0.092 to 0.103 and from 0.142 to 0.157 for
the nonmyristylated and myristylated protein, respectively. For K16C,
ligand binding showed slight increases in mobility on the basis of
the β2 parameter decreasing from 0.201 to 0.174 and
from 0.185 to 0.169 going from apo to ternary states for the nonmyristylated
and myristylated protein, respectively.

The results of MD
simulations analysis of N-terminal dynamics are
illustrated in Figure C and summarized in
Table . The MD simulations agree with the
time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy results because the root mean
squared fluctuation (RMSF) values of the main-chain atoms of the nonmyristylated
protein are much greater than the myristylated protein in both apo
and ternary states. This is illustrated in Figure C and in the lower average main-chain atom RMSF values of
residues 2–40 for the myristylated compared with the nonmyristylated
protein (Table ), indicating that the N-terminus
is more flexible with the nonmyristylated protein, and this agrees
with the anisotropy data at both K7C and K16C. However, there are
small differences between the MD and time-resolved fluorescence data
because the MD simulations showed slightly higher mobility of the
K16 site for the nonmyristylated compared to myristylated protein
(Figure C), and the time-resolved fluorescence
anisotropy data showed slightly lower mobility of the K16 site for
the nonmyristylated compared to myristylated protein (Table ). However, the differences in mobility seen from
both methods are very small and likely not significant. In general,
both MD simulations and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy suggest
similar levels of mobility of the K16 region for both the myristylated
and nonmyristylated enzyme.

These simulations are of the protein
when it is myristylated at its N-terminal glycine residue.

These simulations correspond to
the protein that is not myristylated. Apo simulations are of the protein
in the absence of ligands, and ternary state corresponds to simulations
where the protein was bound to ATP and an inhibitory peptide, SP20.

Flexibility of the C-Subunit
at the Myristate Pocket
In addition to the N-terminus, the
effects of myristylation and ligand
binding on the myristate pocket were examined. On the basis of the
X-ray structure, we chose to mutate and conjugate Asn99. The Asn99
residue does not directly interact with the myristyl moiety and is
directly above the pocket near Phe100, which forms part of the pocket.
We reasoned that if this residue was modified, it should not interfere
with the conformational activity of the pocket (Figure A,B). The results from the FM-N99C mutant are shown in Figure A. In the absence of ligands, myristylation causes
a dramatic decrease in the mobility of this site on the basis of slower
anisotropy decay of Φfast and an increase in the
β2 parameter (0.158 to 0.200) (Table  and Figure A). Thus, myristylation
appears to greatly stabilize the N99C site and presumably the residues
near the myristate pocket in an apo state. Interestingly, the addition
of MgATP/IP20 to form a ternary complex produced an increase in the
mobility of the myristate pocket for both the nonmyristylated and
myristylated protein. The increased mobility for the nonmyristylated
protein is evidenced by a faster anisotropy decay (Φfast) for the ternary nonmyristylated FM-N99C compared to the apo state
(Figure A) and by the decrease in the β2 parameter (0.158 to 0.120) (Table ). Similarly, the β2 parameter decreased for the
myristylated protein (0.200 to 0.181) along with Φ1 (1.6 to 0.8 ns), suggesting increased probe mobility with the formation
of the ternary complex. Together, myristylation appears to stabilize
residues in the myristate pocket compared to the stability of nonmyristylated
protein in the presence and absence of ligands, but ligand binding
and closed state formation increases the mobility of the myristate
pocket for both the nonmyristylated and the myristylated enzyme.

Myristylation
and ligand binding produces altered mobility of the
myristate pocket. (A) Anisotropy decay of FM-N99C in myristylated/apo

the instrument response function. (B–D) RMSF values of the
main-chain atoms from MD simulations for residues 90–105 (B),
150–160 (C), and 300–310 (D).

The results from the MD simulations are in agreement with
the fluorescence
results and are illustrated in Figure B–D
and summarized in Table . The MD simulations
show that Asn99, Glu155, and Tyr306, which are in or near the myristate
pocket, exhibit decreased mobility for the myristylated compared to
the nonmyristylated protein in an apo state. Also, after forming a
ternary complex, the MD simulations show that these regions become
more flexible for both the myristylated and nonmyristylated protein
(Figure B–D). Additionally, the average
main-chain atom RMSF values of residues at the myristate pocket are
lowest for the apo myristylated protein, and the values increase for
both the myristylated and nonmyristylated C-subunit going from an
apo state to a ternary complex (Table ).

Effects of Myristylation and Ligand Binding on the Dynamics
of the C-Tail
Two sites in the C-terminal tail, S325C and
the native C343, were examined with fluorescence anisotropy. The S325C
site is near the “FDDY” motif that is thought to be
important for forming part of the nucleotide binding pocket, and the C343 site is further along the C-tail
and closer to the small lobe and A-helix (Figure A,C). The mobility of the FM-S325C site was unaffected by
myristylation but exhibited dramatic increases in mobility following
MgATP/IP20 binding. This increased mobility is evident from the sharp
decrease in the rate of anisotropy decay in the presence of MgATP/IP20
as illustrated in Figure A and is based on
the large decrease in the β2 parameter (0.154 to
0.094) (Table ). The MD simulations did not
agree with these results; instead, they showed the highest mobility
for the nonmyristylated protein in an apo state and similar mobility
for the other three states (Figure B).

For the myristylated FM-C343, no significant differences
in mobility
were observed between apo and ternary states (Figure C). For the nonmyristylated protein, on the other hand, the
probe mobility decreased upon ligand binding. This effect is primarily
seen as an increase in the β2 parameter (0.154 to
0.174) (Table ). Thus, the mobility of this
region was greater for the myristylated protein than the nonmyristylated
protein in a ternary complex based on a lower β2 parameter
for the myristylated (0.151) compared to the nonmyristylated protein
(0.174) in a ternary complex. Here, myristylation blocked the stabilizing
effect of ligand binding near the C-terminus. The MD simulations provide
some agreement with the experimental results because the nonmyristylated
protein in a ternary complex is generally the least mobile and the
other three states exhibit similar mobility (Figure D). Also, the average RMSF values of the entire C-tail suggest
a similar result of ligand binding showing minimal effects at the
C-tail for the myristylated protein but decreasing mobility for the
nonmyristylated protein (Table ).

Principal Component
Analysis of the MD Simulations
To further characterize the
dynamics of PKA in myristylated and nonmyristylated
forms and in the presence and absence of ligands, we utilized principal
component analysis (PCA) of the MD simulations to determine the most
dominant modes in the dynamics. Specifically, all simulations were
combined and the backbone atoms—C, CA, N, and O—on residues
2–350 were used in the analysis. The two principal components
(PC1 and PC2) are illustrated in Figure A–C
and are attached as movies in the . In this analysis, PC1 and PC2 describe 33% and 15%, respectively,
of the total variance of the motions in the simulation. The projections
of the PKA simulations are shown in Figure A, and the starting crystal structure is shown as a red diamond in
the figure for reference. The major motions displayed in PC1 showed
that as the N-terminus moved vertically, the Gly-rich loop would raise
or lower (Figure B,C). In PC2, the major motions
were the rotation of the N-terminus coupled to rotation of the Gly-rich
loop (Figure B,C). The PCA analysis
shows a larger range of motion for the nonmyristylated protein than
the myristylated protein. Also, the myristylated protein shows mostly
PC1 movements unlike the nonmyristylated protein, which has a large
range of motions.

Discussion
The conformational dynamics
of the C-subunit are known to be important
in the opening and closing of the active-site cleft of the enzyme
and potentially in product turnover and allostery. We utilized time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy and MD
simulations to study the mobility of the C-subunit in myristylated
and nonmyristylated configurations and in the presence and absence
of ligands. We found that myristylation greatly stabilizes the most
N-terminal residues of the A-helix and stabilizes the myristate pocket
residues, which is consistent with recent crystal structures of the
myristylated C-subunit that display an ordered N-terminus with myristic
acid stably bound within its hydrophobic pocket. We also found that the myristylated protein exhibits increased
dynamics of some regions of the protein in the presence of ligands
compared to the dynamics of nonmyristylated protein.

We investigated
the mobility of residues at the N-terminus and
near the myristyl binding pocket for effects of N-myristylation and
ligand binding. N-myristylation greatly stabilized the first 10–12
residues at the N-terminus but exhibited less of an effect further
along the A-helix near K16 (Figure A–C).
Also, ligand binding did not greatly alter the mobility of the N-terminus.
To test for mobility of the myristate pocket, we labeled N99C in the
αC-β4 loop. The αC-β4 loop contains many highly
conserved residues among AGC kinases including Phe100, Pro101, Phe102,
Val104, and L106. Also, this region of
the protein serves as a key link between the N- and C-lobes, and it
is the only segment of the N-lobe that tracks with the C-lobe when
the rigid-body movements of the C-subunit were analyzed. The myristylated FM-N99C protein and N99 site
showed much lower mobility than the nonmyristylated protein, but the
flexibility of the pocket increased for both the myristylated protein
and nonmyristylated protein upon ligand binding (Figure A–D). This increase in dynamics at the myristate pocket
in a ternary complex observed experimentally and with MD simulations
suggests that the myristate pocket and active site may exhibit crosstalk
consistent with recent X-ray crystallography, NMR, and MD simulation studies.

The increased mobility near N99C and at
the myristate pocket upon
ligand binding may seem surprising because Val104 in this loop helps
to form the binding pocket for the adenine ring of ATP (Figure A). However, we believe this result may be explained
on the basis of which regions are likely to be stabilized by ATP binding.
Val104 forms part of the adenine binding pocket, and its dynamics
are likely quenched by ATP binding. Additionally, the C-helix is also
likely anchored by ATP binding because of Glu91 in the helix that
helps to position ATP (Figure A). The N99C
site is centered between these two regions that likely become anchored
by nucleotide binding. We believe that anchoring of both the N- and
C-terminal portions of this loop may be compensated for by increased
movements of the loop itself. This is one possible explanation for
how ATP binding could increase movements of the N99C site and of the
myristate pocket in general.

Possible modes of crosstalk between the myristate
pocket and active
site. (A) The N-lobe is gray, C-lobe and C-tail are olive, the myristic
acid group is shown in sphere representation in orange, and ATP is

that may mediate crosstalk between the myristate pocket and active
site are shown in stick representation or stick and surface representation.
Some residues in the myristic acid pocket are not labeled for viewing

(C) The C-spine and R-spine are colored and depicted as in (B), and
one connection between the F-helix and R-spine is shown.

There is mounting evidence that N-myristylation
may influence the
mobility of different regions within the C-subunit, including the
active site, and could be involved in allosteric regulation of the
C-subunit. NMR experiments displayed altered chemical shifts at the
active site with the myristylated protein. X-ray crystal structures showed that the structure of the N-terminus
is influenced by ligand binding, and
previous MD simulations showed that the conformation of the N-terminus
is coupled to dynamics at the active site of the enzyme. It was hypothesized, on the basis of the X-ray
crystal structures, that effects of N-myristylation could be transmitted
to the active site via interactions between Trp30 on the A-helix,
Arg190 on the activation loop, and Arg93 on the C-helix (Figure A), and the previous
MD simulations of the N-myristylated protein supported this hypothesis. The MD simulations analyzed here also support
this finding. There is increased dynamics of the C-helix, activation
loop, and many of the β-strands in the N-lobe of the C-subunit
for the myristylated protein in a ternary state, whereas the flexibility
of these regions decreases for the nonmyristylated C-subunit (Table ). Thus, these MD simulations also support increased
dynamics of regions near the active site and support the hypothesis
that Arg190 and Arg93 could help to mediate these effects on the basis
of increases in flexibility of the activation loop and C-helix for
the myristylated protein in a ternary complex. Additionally, other
important regions at the active site of the C-subunit including the
catalytic loop, the DFG motif, and residues involved in ATP binding
show similar decreases in mobility going from apo to ternary states
for the myristylated and nonmyristylated protein (Table ). Therefore, this result suggests that the C-helix, activation
loop, and β-strands are unique in displaying increased movements
at the active site with the myristylated protein, and it is not simply
increased dynamics for the entire active site with the myristylated
protein.

The Trp30, Arg190, or Arg93 interaction is one way
that the active
site and N-myristylation could influence each other. Another way that
myristylation and the active site could communicate is via the regulatory
spine (R-spine). Leu106 is another residue that is near the N99C site,
and it is a key hydrophobic contact to the R-spine. The R-spine is
a stack of four hydrophobic residues that are assembled in every active
kinase, typically as a consequence of phosphorylation of the activation
loop.− The adenine ring of ATP completes the parallel C-spine (Figure B,C). It may be possible that myristylation could influence these spines,
especially the regulatory spine, because of its closer proximity to
the myristyl moiety. If myristylation influences either or both spines,
then it could influence mobility of the entire protein because these
residues span both lobes of the kinase.

To further address how
myristylation can influence the dynamics
of the C-subunit and how N-myristylation may impact the active site,
we performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the MD simulations.
The movements associated with the two principal components PC1 and
PC2 are shown in Figure B,C and attached as
movies in the . PC1
and PC2 illustrate that the movements of the N-terminus are coupled
with movements at the active site and with the global conformation
of the protein. PC1 shows that as the N-terminus moves vertically
away from the protein, the Gly-rich loop rises and the C-subunit adopts
a more open conformation. PC2 shows that a rotation of the N-terminus
away from the core of the protein is coupled to rotation of the Gly-rich
loop and N-lobe. Also, projecting the motions of the myristylated
and nonmyristylated protein onto the PC space shows that the nonmyristylated
protein adopts a much wider range of motions than the myristylated
protein (Figure A). Furthermore,
the myristylated protein adopts more PC1 movements than the nonmyristylated
protein. These results suggest that, by stabilizing the N-terminus
and its possible conformations, N-myristylated stabilizes the amount
and types of global conformations and movements of the protein. Also,
the global dynamics and active site dynamics that are experienced
by the myristylated protein are largely opening and closing of the
Gly-rich loop and not rotations of the active site.

The implications
of the PCA results are interesting to consider
in terms of what they suggest about the possible role of N-myristylation
on C-subunit activity or interactions. The results suggest that N-myristylation
may prevent or limit drastic conformational changes of the enzyme,
possibly due to stabilization of the N-terminus. This is supported
by the relatively small range of motions adopted by the myristylated
protein in apo and ternary states on the basis of PCA analysis (Figure A). Therefore, N-myristylation may keep the C-subunit
in a relatively stable conformation, which could be important for
ligand binding and activity. This possibility is exemplified in the
PCA plots (Figure A) because the range of
motions exhibited by the nonmyristylated protein in an apo and ternary
state are very different, but for the myristylated protein, on the
other hand, the motions adopted in apo or ternary states are very
similar. Therefore, N-myristylation may help to lock the enzyme in
conformations that are more representative of the active state of
enzyme, because the ternary complex is more likely to adopt conformations
suitable for catalysis. Also, because the PCA analysis shows that
the motions adopted by the N-myristylated protein are mostly opening
and closing of the Gly-rich loop, this result suggests that N-myristylation
could influence the ability for substrates to bind and be turned over
by the enzyme by modulating opening and closing of the active site.
Finally, in general, the PCA results further imply that the active
site and the myristyl moiety as well as its binding pocket may influence
each other.

In addition to the myristate pocket, N-terminus,
and possibly the
active site, the flexibility of other regions may be influenced by
N-myristylation. For instance, another site that we labeled for time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy was the native C343. This region is more mobile
in a ternary complex for the myristylated C-subunit than the nonmyristylated
enzyme (Figure C). The mobility of this region
is not greatly influenced by ligand binding for the myristylated protein
but becomes less mobile upon ligand binding for the nonmyristylated
protein on the basis of time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and
this result is also in agreement with the MD simulations based on
the average RMSF values of the C-tail, which are very similar for
the myristylated protein in apo and ternary states but decrease from
apo to ternary states for the nonmyristylated protein (Table ). Myristylation, thus, prevents the stabilizing
effect caused by ligand binding that occurs with the nonmyristylated
protein and, effectively, results in increased mobility of this region
in a ternary state relative to the nonmyristylated protein.

Additionally, the average main-chain atom RMSF values from several
regions throughout the C-subunit suggest that ligand binding increases
flexibility in the myristylated enzyme but decreases dynamics for
the nonmyristylated C-subunit (Table ). For
instance, the N-lobe, the C-lobe, and the C-tail all show increases
in average RMSF values, indicating increased flexibility, for the
myristylated protein going from an apo to ternary state (Table ). The nonmyristylated protein, on the other hand,
shows decreases in average RMSF values for these same regions, indicating
decreased mobility, going from apo to ternary state (Table ). Thus, the flexibility of the myristylated protein
is generally increased upon ligand binding and generally decreased
upon ligand binding for the nonmyristylated protein. These results
suggest that myristylation can influence other regions within the
C-subunit following ligand binding including, potentially, the active
site.

We also wanted to test the mobility of the C-tail region
near the
FDDY motif that forms part of the ATP binding site (Figure C). To do this, we investigated the S325 site. This
is an important region because the S325C site is near the PxxP motif
in the C-tail (residues 313–316 in PKA), which is a known protein
binding site in another AGC kinase, PKC, and may be a binding site
in PKA as well. Furthermore, 3-phosphoinositide
dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which phosphorylates the activation
loop of different kinases, binds to the C-tail of PKA near this region. With time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy,
the FM-S325C site showed large changes in mobility upon ligand binding
for both the myristylated and nonmyristylated protein (Figure A), but the MD simulations displayed increased mobility
for the apo myristylated protein with similar mobility for the other
states (Figure B). Obviously, the discrepancy
between the MD and fluorescence data at the S325C site is disappointing.
There are some possible explanations for the different results between
the two methods. For example, it is possible that the time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy results are distorted by the fluorophore,
fluorescein-5-maleimide, altering the natural mobility of the C-tail.
It is possible that the fluorophore could interact with other residues
in the C-tail or near the active site, and this could cause the increased
mobility upon formation of a ternary complex that may not represent
natural mobility of the site. Alternatively, there could be problems
with the MD simulation results. One possible explanation for discrepancies
in the MD simulation results is problems with sampling. It is possible
that these simulations may represent outliers in possible motions
of the C-tail, and if more simulations were performed or longer simulations
were performed, the final RMSF values may change and could be closer
to the experimental findings. Additionally, one should keep in mind
that the MD simulations are not “measuring” the same
things as time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA). The MD simulations
are estimating spatial displacement of the main-chain atom over time,
whereas TRFA monitors motions of a reporter at the end of a cysteine
side chain. (The motions of the reporter group are influenced by (1)
the torsional motions of the side chain and linking tether arm, (2)
the backbone motions of the peptidyl chain around the conjugated cysteine,
and (3) the whole-body rotation diffusion of the protein.) Clearly,
caution should be used in interpreting the results from either method.

Beyond adding insight into the conformational dynamics of the C-subunit,
the general but not complete consistency between the fluorescence
anisotropy and MD simulations and previous NMR and X-ray crystallographic
results adds credence to the use of fluorescence anisotropy to measure
protein conformational dynamics. Clearly, there are limitations to
its use. One such limitation is the possibility that the mutation
and conjugation significantly perturb local dynamics and/or function.
For instance, if the native C199A site in PKA is labeled, then PKA
loses catalytic activity. Fortunately,
with PKA, labeling of the native cysteine residues is prevented with
the addition of MgATP, but with other proteins, the native cysteine
residues may need to be mutated in order to perform time-resolved
fluorescence anisotropy. Also, if mutation of the cysteine residues
negatively impacts the protein’s natural function or interactions,
then time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy experiments become impractical.
Additionally, MD simulations also have limitations and should ideally
be verified with experimental findings because artifacts from MD simulations
are possible due, for example, to short simulation times or very few
simulations. When only a small number of simulations and/or short
simulation times are utilized, then it is possible to see artifacts
in the simulations. Like other techniques, it is ideal to perform
replications to ensure that results are representative of actual motions
and do not represent outliers in possible dynamics. Additionally,
MD simulations are reliant on a solved crystal structure. Therefore,
it is possible for MD simulations to be biased by the starting crystal
structure especially if the structure does not represent a typical
conformation of the protein in solution. Therefore, there are some
limitations to both MD simulations and time-resolved fluorescence
anisotropy, so some caution should be used in the interpretation of
results from these approaches. Ideally, cross validation should be
utilized for either method, and the general agreement in these studies
between the MD simulations and fluorescence anisotropy results supports
the use and findings obtained from each method.

In summary,
the results of these studies provide new insights into
the motions adopted by the C-subunit in response to N-myristylation
and ligand binding. As several studies showed previously,− we also find that N-myristylation stabilizes the N-terminus and
myristate pocket, and N-myristylation also may exhibit crosstalk with
the active site of the enzyme. We found that ligand binding increases
movements at the myristate pocket, and myristylation in combination
with ligand binding showed modest increases in dynamics near the active
site. Together this suggests that N-myristylation may impart allosteric
regulation of the C-subunit.
