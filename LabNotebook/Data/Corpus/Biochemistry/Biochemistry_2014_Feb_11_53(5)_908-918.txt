(±)-Mecamylamine hydrochloride (Inversine) was developed for
the treatment of hypertension in the 1950s, and its mechanism of action
is based on the inhibition of ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(AChRs), especially the α3β4 AChR. Because of severe side
effects elicited by (±)-mecamylamine (e.g., postural hypotension),
and the development of safer drugs for the treatment of hypertension,
(±)-mecamylamine was consequently displaced from the market.
However, new research on (±)-mecamylamine has demonstrated that
this drug possesses anti-addictive, antidepressant, and pro-cognitive
activities., These new results open the door for the
development of (±)-mecamylamine as a therapeutic treatment for
several neurological disorders.

(±)-Mecamylamine is the
racemic mix of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
(Figure ). Electrophysiological results showed
that (S)-(+)-mecamylamine has inhibitory actions
at central human
(h) neuronal AChRs superior to those of (R)-(−)-mecamylamine,
compared to muscle type AChRs. Additional
studies determined that (S)-(+)-mecamylamine behaves
as a positive allosteric modulator (i.e., enhances the activity of
an agonist without producing any effect by itself) of the (α4)2(β2)3 stoichiometry (i.e., the so-called
highly sensitive α4β2 AChR), whereas (R)-(−)-mecamylamine inhibits noncompetitively this receptor
stoichiometry, and that (S)-(+)-mecamylamine is more
effective than (R)-(−)-mecamylamine as a noncompetitive
inhibitor of the (α4)3(β2)2 stoichiometry
(i.e., the so-called weakly sensitive α4β2 AChR). These functional differences correspond very
well with the therapeutic effect elicited by each isomer. For example,
(S)-(+)-mecamylamine was found to be more effective
than the (R)-(−)-enantiomer in blocking nicotine-induced
seizures and produced less suppression of open field locomotor activity
than (R)-(−)-mecamylamine. On the basis of these and other preclinical results, clinical
trials were conducted to determine whether (S)-(+)-mecamylamine
is an alternative for the treatment of depression.

Molecular structures of exo-(S)-(+)-mecamylamine and exo-(R)-(−)-mecamylamine
in the protonated states. The nitrogen atom is colored blue; hydrogens
are colored gray and carbons green. The ligands are shown using the
stick mode with aliphatic hydrogen atoms not shown explicitly.

On the basis of the fact that
the pharmacological profile of each
mecamylamine isomer depends on the α4β2 AChR stoichiometry, we want to determine whether there are different
binding interactions for (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine at each hα4β2 AChR stoichiometry.
In this regard, the transmembrane domain (TMD) of each hα4 and
hβ2 subunit was first expressed and purified as recently described, and high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) experiments were subsequently performed to determine the direct
interaction of each mecamylamine isomer with the respective (α4)2(β2)3- and (α4)3(β2)2-TMD. Additional molecular docking studies were performed
to structurally delineate the binding pockets and to determine the
molecular orientation of each isomer in the binding pockets. Previous
functional and structural studies demonstrated that (±)-mecamylamine
partially inhibits the binding of [3H]imipramine to the
hα4β2 and hα3β4 AChRs., However,
we do not know if each isomer binds to particular domains at each
AChR stoichiometry. Thus, [3H]imipramine competition experiments
were performed using hα4β2 AChR membranes to determine
whether each mecamylamine isomer binds to this site.

Experimental
Procedures
Materials
[3H]Imipramine (47.5 Ci/mmol)
was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences Products, Inc. (Boston,
MA) and stored in ethanol at −20 °C. Imipramine hydrochloride,
polyethylenimine, leupeptin, bacitracin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, benzamidine,
lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), paramethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
sodium acetate, 2-mercaptoethanol, N,N-dimethyldodecylamine, and an N-oxide solution were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). Mecamylamine isomers
were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, ON).
(±)-Epibatidine hydrochloride, Geneticin, and hygromycine B were
obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Ellisville, MO). κ-Bungarotoxin
(κ-BTx) was obtained from Biotoxins Inc. (St. Cloud, FL). Fetal
bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Aleken Biologicals (Nash, TX).
Deuterium oxide (D2O) was obtained from Cambrige Isotope
Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). Acetic acid was purchased from Fisher
Scientific Co. (Fair Lawn, NJ). Salts were of analytical grade.

Preparation of the Transmembrane Domains (TMDs) of the α4
and β2 Subunits for Solution NMR
The α4- and
β2-subunits of the hα4β2 AChR, with the extracellular
and intracellular domains removed by mutagenesis (i.e., α4-
and β2-TMD, respectively), were expressed and purified as recently
described in detail. Different ratios
of α4- and β2-TMDs were prepared for studying interactions
of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine.
To avoid strong peak overlap in the NMR spectra, only one 15N-labeled subunit type (α4 or β2) was used in each sample.
The isotope-labeled subunit was kept as a dominant component in the
mixture to ensure adequate NMR signals from the protein samples. For
example, α4 was labeled in (α4)3(β2)2; likewise, β2 was labeled in (β2)3(α4)2. The molar ratios used for (α4)3(β2)2 and (α4)2(β2)3 represent only the sample conditions and by no means represent
uniformly assembled pentamers. Another reason to retain the 15N-labeled subunit (15N NMR observable) as a major component
and the unlabeled one (invisible in 15N NMR) as the minor
component is to keep the total protein concentration below 0.3 mM
to prevent protein aggregation. Each sample contains 0.25 mM monomer
protein, 1–2% (40–80 mM) LDAO (lauryldimethylamine-oxide)
detergent, 10 mM NaCl, 5 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.7), and 20 mM 2-mercaptoethanol
to prevent disulfide bond formation. The NMR sample was adjusted to
pH 4.7 to prevent signal reduction in 1H–15N TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra due to exchange of backbone amide protons
with the solvent; 5% D2O was added to the samples for deuterium
lock in NMR measurements. Each mecamylamine isomer was titrated to
the samples using a micropipet, and the mecamylamine concentration
in the NMR samples was calculated on the basis of the concentration
of the stock solution.

NMR Data Acquisition, Processing, and Analysis
NMR
spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer equipped
with a triple-resonance inverse-detection cryoprobe (TCI, Bruker Instruments,
Billerica, MA) at 45 °C. 1H–15N
TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra were recorded for each sample before and after
the addition of (S)-(+)- or (R)-(−)-mecamylamine.
The mecamylamine concentrations in the NMR samples were 3, 15, 40,
and 100 μM for (S)-(+)-mecamylamine and 15,
40, and 100 μM for (R)-(−)-mecamylamine.
Spectral windows of 13 ppm (1024 data points) in the 1H
dimension and 22.5 ppm (104 data points) in the 15N dimension
were used, and the relaxation delay was 1.5 s. The 1H chemical
shifts were referenced to the DSS resonance at 0 ppm, and the 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe version
4.1 and NMRDraw version 1.8 and analyzed
using Sparky version 3.10. Each processed
spectrum had 4096 × 512 data points. The 1H and 15N chemical shift assignments for the α4- and β2-TMD
after the addition of mecamylamine were referenced to the previous
assignments for the same proteins without drugs. The specific residues involved in the binding of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
to each α4- and β2-TMD were identified on the basis of
drug-induced chemical shift changes in the HSQC spectra.

Molecular Modeling
and Docking
The absolute numbering
of amino acids varies greatly between subunits; thus, the prime nomenclature
(−5′ to 20′) was used. The sequence numbering
of the human neuronal α4- and β2-subunits was obtained
from the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (http://www.us.expasy.org). The TMD model of each (α4)2(β2)3 and (α4)3(β2)2 stoichiometry was constructed as recently published.

Each mecamylamine enantiomer (Figure ), in the protonated and neutral form, was first
sketched using HyperChem version 6.03 (HyperCube Inc., Gainesville,
FL), optimized using the semiempirical method AM1 (Polak–Ribiere
algorithm to a gradient lower than 0.1 kcal Å–1 mol–1), and then transferred for the subsequent
step of the ligand docking procedure. Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD
2011.4.3.0, Molegro ApS, Aarhus, Denmark) was used for docking simulations
of the flexible molecule into the rigid target of both (α4)2(β2)3- and (α4)3(β2)2-TMD models. To determine the molecular details and orientation
of each mecamylamine enantiomer in the domains defined by the NMR
results, docking simulations were directed to those domains. The directed
molecular dockings were performed using the settings described by
Arias et al.,, including 100 runs, a maximal
number of iterations of 10000, and a maximal number of poses of 10.

Preparation of Membranes from HEK293-hα4β2 Cells
To prepare cell membranes in large quantities, HEK293-hα4β2
cells were cultured in suspension using nontreated Petri dishes (150
mm × 15 mm) as previously described.,, Briefly, cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture
of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 3.7
g/L NaHCO3, 1.0 g/L sucrose, stable glutamine (l-alanyl-l-glutamine, 524 mg/L), and Ham’s F-12 nutrient
mixture (PromoCell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) containing 1.176 g/L
NaHCO3 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, Geneticin (0.2
mg/mL), and hygromycine B (0.2 mg/mL). After the cells had been cultured
at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% relative humidity for ∼3–4
weeks, they were harvested by being gently scraped and centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C using a Sorvall Super T21 centrifuge.
Cells were resuspended in binding saline (BS) buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl,
120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4)] containing 0.025% (w/v) sodium azide and a cocktail of
protease inhibitors, including leupeptin, bacitracin, pepstatin A,
aprotinin, benzamidine, and PMSF. The suspension was maintained on
ice, homogenized using a Polytron PT3000 instrument (Brinkmann Instruments
Inc., Westbury, NY), and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 30 min
at 4 °C. The pellet was finally resuspended in BS buffer containing
20% sucrose (w/v) using the Polytron and briefly (5 × 15 s) sonicated
(Branson Ultrasonics Co., Danbury, CT) to ensure maximal homogenization.
Cell membranes, containing hα4β2 AChRs, were frozen at
−80 °C until they were required. The total protein was
determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL).

[3H]Imipramine Competition Binding
Experiments Using
hα4β2 AChRs in Different Conformational States
The effect of (S)-(+)-mecamylamine was compared
to that of (R)-(−)-mecamylamine by [3H]imipramine binding to hα4β2 AChRs in different conformational
states using the method previously developed in our laboratory., In this regard, AChR membranes (1.5 mg/mL) were suspended in BS
buffer with 21 nM [3H]imipramine in the presence of 0.1
μM κ-BTx (resting/κ-BTx-bound state) or 0.1 μM
(±)-epibatidine (desensitized/epibatidine-bound state) and preincubated
for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Bungarotoxins such as κ-BTx
are competitive antagonists that maintain the AChRs in the resting
(closed) state. The nonspecific binding
was assessed in the presence of 100 μM imipramine. The total
volume was divided into aliquots, and increasing concentrations of
(S)-(+)- or (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
were added to each tube and incubated for 90 min at RT. AChR-bound
[3H]imipramine was then separated from free ligand by a
filtration assay using a 48-sample harvester system with GF/B Whatman
filters (Brandel Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), previously soaked with 0.5%
polyethylenimine for 30 min. The membrane-containing filters were
transferred to scintillation vials with 3 mL of Bio-Safe II (Research
Product International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL), and the radioactivity
was determined using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman
Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA).

The concentration–response
data were curve-fitted by nonlinear least-squares analysis using Prism
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The observed IC50 values
from the competition experiments described above were transformed
into inhibition constant (Ki) values using
the Cheng–Prusoff relationship:where [[3H]imipramine] is the initial
concentration of [3H]imipramine and Kdimipramine is the [3H]imipramine dissociation
constant for the hα4β2 AChR (0.83 μM). The Ki and nH values were summarized in Table .

Results
Interaction of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-Mecamylamine
with the α4β2-TMDs Determined
by NMR
The interaction of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine with specific residues from the
(α4)3(β2)2- and (α4)2(β2)3-TMDs was assessed by measuring the change
in the peak chemical shift or peak intensity from the of 1H–15N TROSY-HSQC spectra after addition of the
drug. The α4β2-TMDs form pentameric assemblies under the
NMR experimental condition (Figure S1 of the ). Figures  and  show representative regions of the (α4)3(β2)2- and (α4)2(β2)3-TMD TROSY-HSQC spectra in the absence and presence of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine,
respectively. Several residues demonstrated significant chemical shift
changes resulting from drug interaction, suggesting that each isomer
interacts with the protein only at a few specific locations in the
AChR TMD. The effects of the drug on all assigned residues of the
(α4)3(β2)2- and (α4)2(β2)3-TMDs are shown in Figures S2–S9 of
the .

Residues affected by the drug in α4-TMD (cyan) are colored purple

colored green (V230, L233, K240, and I287). See Figure S7 of the  for the chemical shift

a function of residue number and Figure S9 of the  for the chemical shift change or peak
intensity decay as a function of drug concentration.

The hα4β2-TMD residues showing significant
chemical
shifts by (S)-(+)-mecamylamine include those at TM1
(i.e., α4-Leu235, α4-Val236, α4-Leu239, and β2-Val230),
TM2 (i.e., β2-Gly238 and β2-Lys260), TM3 (i.e., β2-Ile287),
and TM4 (i.e., β2-Thr449), with α4-Leu239 and β2-Val230
being the most sensitive to the drug (Figure ). In addition, the peak intensity of α4-Thr248 (at TM2) increased
significantly, whereas the peak intensity of α4-Gly244 and α4-Leu249
(at TM2) decreased significantly. A preliminary assumption is that
residues β2-Lys260, α4-Gly244, α4-Thr248, and β2-Gly238,
which are facing the ion channel lumen, are part of luminal (L) binding
sites (see Table ). Residues α4-Leu235,
α4-Val236, α4-Leu239, β2-Val230, and β2-Ile287,
which are located at the cytoplasmic end of the respective TMDs, as
well as α4-Leu249, which is facing TM1, might be forming different
nonluminal sites (see Table ).

Hill coefficients.

The interaction of (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
with the α4β2-TMD is shown in Figure  and Figures S3 and S4 of the . The residues involved in drug binding are located
at TM1 (i.e., α4-Leu235, α4-Val236, α4-Leu239, β2-Val230,
and β2-Leu233), TM2 (i.e., α4-Glu266, α4-Ile268,
and β2-Lys240), and TM3 (i.e., α4-Thr296 and β2-Ile287)
(Figure ). The chemical shifts of α4-Leu239,
α4-Thr296, and β2-Val230 were the most affected by this
enantiomer. We also observed significant intensity changes for α4-Gly244
and α4-Thr248 located at TM2. These residues may be forming
an L site close to the threonine ring (position 2′). In contrast
to the results with (S)-(+)-mecamylamine, (R)-(−)-mecamylamine affected α4-Glu266 more
than it affected β2-Lys260. Thus, (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
may be interacting with an L binding site formed by α4-Glu266
and α4-Ile268 (Figure B), which are
located close to the extracellular mouth of the ion channel. In general,
(R)-(−)-mecamylamine binds to the same NL
sites described for (S)-(+)-mecamylamine (Table ). However, the large chemical shift observed at
α4-Thr296 (at TM3) (Figure B) in addition
to the effect on β2-Leu233 (at TM1) (Figure C) supports the existence of additional NL sites for (R)-(−)-mecamylamine (Table ).

Molecular Docking
Each mecamylamine enantiomer was
directed to be docked to the various pockets formed by the residues
interacting with mecamylamine previously determined by the NMR experiments
(Figures  and ). Because
mecamylamine is ∼100% in the protonated form at physiological
pH,, the different poses are shown in the protonated state.
Nevertheless, the same poses were observed for the neutral form. The
results from the directed docking of (S)-(+)- and
(R)-(−)-mecamylamine at the (α4)2(β2)3- and (α4)3(β2)2-TMD stoichiometries indicate that each enantiomer presents
different modes of interaction at several L and NL binding sites (see
Table ). The first docking sphere includes
residues α4-Gly244 and β2-Gly238, which the NMR experiments
indicated were important (Table ). With regard
to the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD stoichiometry,
the docking results indicate that the most favorable energy of binding
was obtained for (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacting
with L1 (Table ), which is located at the
cytoplasmic mouth of the ion channel (Figure A). In this site, the nonpolar portion of (S)-(+)-mecamylamine
interacts with the β2-Gly238 and α4-Gly244 backbones (position
−3′) by van der Waals contacts, whereas its positively
charged amino group forms a short-range (distance of &lt;4.5 Å)
electrostatic interaction with the carboxylic group of α4-Glu242
(position −5′) at the cytoplasmic or inner ring (Figure B). Interestingly, in the case of the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD stoichiometry, (S)-(+)- and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine also present
favorable energies of binding at this site (Table ). Each isomer maintains its interaction with β2-Gly238,
while the nitrogen from the ligand’s amino group forms a hydrogen
bond with the hydroxyl group of α4-Thr248, which the NMR results
indicated was important (Table ). Although
these poses include α4-Thr248 at the threonine ring (position
2′) (not shown) and (S)-(+)-mecamylamine has
a different orientation with respect to that found in the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD model (see Figure B), it is considered a homologous site (partially overlapping)
with respect to L1, and thus, it is named L1′ (compare L1 and
L1′ in Table ).

The methyl moiety of (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacts

view of the α4/β2-intersubunit site (orange). (S)-(+)-Mecamylamine is oriented predominantly toward α4-Leu235
(at TM1) but also interacts by van der Waals contacts with nonpolar
residues, including β2-Tyr238, β2-Ile287, and β2-Val291
(at TM3). (E) Detailed view of the β2-intersubunit site (light

interactions to nonpolar residues at TM1 (i.e., Val230 at one β2-subunit
and Leu233 at a different β2-subunit) and TM2 (i.e., β2-Leu243,
which is not facing the ion channel lumen), and with the nonpolar
portion of β2-Lys240 (position −1′). In addition,
the amino moiety of the ligand forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl
group of β2-Ser290 (at TM3). In panels A–E, for the sake
of clarity, the α4-subunits are colored cyan and the β2-subunits
white. Oxygen atoms are colored red, nitrogens blue, and hydrogens
white. In panels A–C, for the sake of clarity, one α4-subunit

β2, α4, and β2 (from left to right, respectively).
The ligands are rendered in ball (A) or stick (B–E) mode, whereas

Docking site location for protonated (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
in the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD model. (A)
Side view of the binding sites for (R)-(−)-mecamylamine.
The molecule interacts with two luminal sites, one close to the threonine
(THR) ring (position 2′) (L1′ colored red) and another
close to the extracellular ring (position 20′) (L2′
colored blue), as well as with two nonluminal binding sites [i.e.,
the α4-intrasubunit (orange) and α4-TM3-intrasubunit (yellow)
sites]. Because the location of L1′ is similar to that found
for (S)-(+)-mecamylamine in the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD model (see L1 in Figure B), the molecular details are not shown. (B) Detailed view
of L2′ (blue). The positively charged amino group of (R)-(−)-mecamylamine forms a short-range (distance
of &lt;4.5 Å) electrostatic interaction with the carboxylic group
of α4-Glu266 (position 20′), whereas the aliphatic portion
of the molecule binds to α4-Ile267 (position 21′) by
van der Waals interactions. Although the orientation of (R)-(−)-mecamylamine is different from that of (S)-(+)-mecamylamine (see Figure C), it binds
to a homologous site in the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD model. (C) Detailed view of the α4-intrasubunit site (orange).
(R)-(−)-Mecamylamine interacts by van der
Waals contacts with the aliphatic portion of α4-Lys246 (at TM2
but not facing the ion channel lumen), and with nonpolar residues
α4-Pro240 and α4-Val236 (at TM1). (D) Detailed view of
the α4-TM3-intrasubunit site (yellow). The black arrow indicates
the hydrogen bond between the amino moiety of (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
and the hydroxyl group of α4-Thr296 (at TM3). In addition, the
aliphatic portion of the molecule interacts by van der Waals contacts
with nonpolar residues α4-Ile295 and α4-Val298 (at TM3).
Residues determined by NMR experiments are colored as in Figure D, E. Additional details are given in the legend
of Figure .

The second docking sphere includes residue β2-Lys260,
which
the NMR experiments indicated was important (Figure C and Table ). The docking results
at the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD stoichiometry
indicate that (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacts with
this site with a favorable energy of binding (see L2 in Table ). L2 is located close to the extracellular mouth
of the ion channel (Figure A), where the methyl
moiety of (S)-(+)-mecamylamine binds by van der Waals
interactions to the aliphatic portion of β2-Lys260 located at
the outer ring (position 20′), whereas its positively charged
amino group is oriented toward the β2-Leu256 backbone (position
16′) (Figure C). Interestingly, (R)-(−)-mecamylamine binds to a homologous site in
the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD stoichiometry
(Figure B). In this energetically less favorable
orientation (Table ), the positively charged
amino group of the isomer forms a short-range electrostatic interaction
with the carboxylic group of α4-Glu266 (position 20′),
whereas its aliphatic portion interacts by van der Waals contacts
with the aliphatic moiety of α4-Ile267 (position 21′)
(Figure B). α4-Glu266 is identified
as an important residue by the NMR experiments (Figure A and Table ).

The third docking
sphere includes α4-Leu235, α4-L239,
and β2-Ile287, which the NMR experiments for each enantiomer
indicated were residues (Figures A,C and A,C and Table ). The docking
results indicate that (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacts
with comparatively less energy of binding with the intersubunit site
located between the α4- and β2-TMDs (see the α4/β2-intersubunit
site in Table ). In this site, (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacts by van der Waals contacts with residues
located at TM3 (i.e., β2-Ile287 and β2-Val291) and TM1
(i.e., α4-Leu235 and α4-Tyr238) (Figure D). Because the pose for (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
at this site is structurally and energetically similar to that for
(S)-(+)-mecamylamine (see Table ), the model is not shown.

The fourth docking sphere
includes residue β2-Thr449 (at
TM4), which was significantly affected by (S)-(+)-mecamylamine
during the NMR experiments (Figure C). Because
the docking results indicate that this interaction is relatively less
favorable (−4 and −8 kJ/mol for the protonated and neutral
states, respectively), this site is not included.

The last docking
sphere includes residues β2-Val230, β2-Leu233,
and β2-Lys240, which the NMR experiments indicated were important
(Table  and Figures C and B). The docking results indicate that
the interaction of (S)-(+)-mecamylamine (Figure E) and (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
(not shown) at the interface of two β2 subunits is energetically
favorable (see the β2-intersubunit site in Table ). Each ligand interacts by van der Waals contacts with nonpolar
residues TM1 Val230 and TM2 Leu243 from one β2-subunit and with
TM1 Leu233 from a different β2-subunit; the methyl moiety from
its amino group interacts by van der Waals contacts with the aliphatic
portion of β2-Lys240 (at TM1), and its amino moiety forms a
hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of β2-Ser290 (Figure E).

One of the used docking spheres of the
(α4)3(β2)2-TMD model includes α4-Leu235,
α4-Leu239, α4-Val236,
and α4-Leu249, considered to be important residues by the NMR
results (see Table ). The docking results
show that both (S)-(+)-mecamylamine (not shown) and
(R)-(−)-mecamylamine (Figure C) interact within the α4-TMD with similar binding energies
(see the α4-intrasubunit site in Table ). Each isomer interacts by van der Waals contacts with the aliphatic
portions of α4-Lys246 (at TM2 but not facing the ion channel
lumen) and α4-Val236 (at TM1) as well as with nonpolar residue
α4-Pro240 (at TM1). However, the enantiomers do not interact
with α4-Leu235, which was found at the α4/β2-intersubunit
site (Figure D).

The last docking sphere
at the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD stoichiometry
includes α4-Thr296, considered to
be important by the NMR experiments (Figure A). The docking results show that (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
interacts with the α4-TM3-intrasubunit site with a favorable
energy of binding (Table ). More specifically,
a hydrogen bond is formed between the nitrogen atom of the amine moiety
of the enantiomer and the hydroxyl group of α4-Thr296 (at TM3),
and van der Waals interactions are observed with the nonpolar portion
of α4-Ile295 and α4-Val298 (also located at TM3) (Figure D).

[3H]Imipramine Competition Binding
(±)-Mecamylamine
partially inhibits binding of [3H]imipramine to hα4β2
AChRs. However, we do not know the binding
affinity of each enantiomer, which could be important for explaining
the distinct pharmacologic activity of (S)-(+)- and
(R)-(−)-mecamylamine on each α4β2
AChR stoichiometry. In this regard, the
effect of each enantiomer on the binding of [3H]imipramine
to hα4β2 AChRs in the resting (κ-BTx-bound) and
desensitized (epibatidine-bound) states was determined (Figure ). The apparent Ki values suggest that both enantiomers practically
do not bind to the [3H]imipramine binding site at hα4β2
AChRs in either the resting (&gt;150 μM) or desensitized (&gt;220
μM) state (Table ). The observed nH values are
lower than unity (∼0.5) (see Table ), indicating a negative cooperative interaction between imipramine
and each mecamylamine isomer. In turn, this suggests that both mecamylamine
enantiomers do not overlap the imipramine sites at the hα4β2
AChR.

Inhibition of binding of [3H]imipramine to hα4β2
AChRs by (R)-(−)-mecamylamine (A) or (S)-(+)-mecamylamine (B) in different conformational states.
hα4β2 AChR membranes (1.5 mg/mL) were equilibrated (90
min) with 21 nM [3H]imipramine, in the presence of 0.1
μM κ-BTx (resting state) (△) or 1 μM (±)-epibatidine
(desensitized state) (●) and increasing concentrations of (A)
(R)-(−)-mecamylamine or (B) (S)-(+)-mecamylamine. Each plot is the combination of two or three
separate experiments each performed in triplicate. From these plots,
the IC50 and nH values were
obtained by nonlinear least-squares fit, and the apparent Ki values were calculated using eq  and are summarized in Table .

Discussion
This
study is an attempt to determine, at the molecular level,
how each mecamylamine enantiomer interacts with particular regions
from the (α4)2(β2)3- and (α4)3(β2)2-TMDs. In this regard, high-resolution
NMR, molecular docking, and radioligand binding approaches were applied.

The NMR experiments determined the interaction of each mecamylamine
enantiomer with residues from the respective (α4)2(β2)3- and (α4)3(β2)2-TMD stoichiometries. The high-quality NMR spectra showed
what different residues from the α4- and β2-TMDs are significantly
affected by both enantiomers (Figures  and ). The results indicate that although the interactions
of both enantiomers are similar, some differences are observed. For
instance, (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacts with β2-Lys260
at L2 (located at the outer ring, position 20′), whereas the
(R)-(−)-enantiomer prefers α4-Glu266
at the same position. Because mecamylamine has a pKa of 11.2, it will be protonated
either at pH 4.7 (i.e., used in our NMR experiments) or at physiological
pH. However, α4-Glu266, which is charged at physiological pH
(pKa = 4.2), can be partially neutralized
at pH 4.7. In this regard, the electrostatic interaction between protonated
mecamylamine and α4-Glu266 would be stronger at physiological
pH than at the experimental pH.

The NMR results first discriminated
the residues involved in the
binding of each mecamylamine enantiomer at the α4β2-TMD.
These residues were subsequently tested by using different docking
spheres. The docking experiments determined the mode of binding and
the molecular orientation of each enantiomer in the L and NL binding
sites at both TMD stoichiometries. Each enantiomer, in the protonated
and neutral state, interacts with binding domains by a combination
of van der Waals, hydrogen bond, and electrostatic contacts. In addition
to residues identified by NMR, docking simulations suggested that
additional residues may possibly be involved in ligand binding.

With regard to the luminal sites, (S)-(+)- and
(R)-(−)-mecamylamine bind with slightly different
orientations at sites located close to the cytoplasmic (compare L1
vs L1′) and extracellular (compare L2 vs L2′) mouths
of the hα4β2-TMD. Although a mecamylamine binding site
was previously located near the extracellular mouth of the hα4β2
and hα3β4 AChR ion channels, coincident
with the L2/L2′ site, recent results from our laboratory indicate
that mecamylamine enantiomers may interact with a luminal site located
in the middle of the Torpedo AChR ion channel, as
well. This divergence suggests that different
AChR subtypes may have distinct binding site locations for mecamylamine
enantiomers. A binding domain close to the extracellular mouth was
also characterized for serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors at neuronal AChRs, as well as for SADU-3-72
(a bupropion photoactivatable analogue) and other NCAs at muscle AChRs. Previous
photoaffinity labeling data indicate that PCP may bind to the threonine
ring (position 2′) from Torpedo AChRs, which
is closer to the cytoplasmic mouth (overlapping
the L1/L1′ site). On the basis of our previously published
data, and the radioligand (Table ) and docking (Table ) results
presented here, we can infer that each mecamylamine enantiomer does
not directly bind to the imipramine luminal site, located in the middle
of the hα4β2 AChR ion channel. Nevertheless, we are conducting
new docking experiments to demonstrate whether imipramine has additional
NL sites that may coincide with mecamylamine enantiomers and other
NCAs.

With regard to the NL sites, there are some similarities
between
both enantiomers interacting with the α4/β2-intersubunit
(i.e., cytoplasmic end of α4-TM1 and β2-TM3) and β2-intersubunit
(i.e., cytoplasmic end of two β2-TMDs) sites at the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD, as well as with the α4-intersubunit
(i.e., at the cytoplasmic ends of α4-TM1 and α4-TM2) at
the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD. An important
distinction between the enantiomers is that (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
binds to the α4-TM3-intrasubunit site that is not found for
(S)-(+)-mecamylamine. Aside from this difference,
the existence of NL sites might be related to the trapping blocking
mechanism previously described for (±)-mecamylamine by Giniatullin
and colleagues. After agonist-induced
activation, (±)-mecamylamine penetrates and blocks open AChR
channels in a voltage-dependent manner; shortly after channel closure,
the molecule reaches the NL site(s), remaining trapped in a less ionic
environment, which supports the voltage independence of the trapping
mechanism.

New results for Torpedo AChRs indicate that mecamylamine
enantiomers interact with several NL binding sites. One of them, the intersubunit site, includes γ-Val297,
which corresponds to β2-Ile287 at the α4/β2-intersubunit
site observed for both mecamylamine enantiomers at the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD (Table ). Interestingly, several mecamylamine binding sites coincide with
the anesthetic binding domains found in the proton-activated ion channel
from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi (i.e., ELIC) and in the α4β2-TMD. More precisely, halothane overlaps several binding
domains found for mecamylamine enantiomers in the α4β2-TMD,
including residues α4-Val236, α4-Leu239, and α4-Leu249
(at the α4-intrasubunit site), β2-Leu233 (at the β2-intersubunit
site), β2-Lys260 (at L2), and α4-Ile268 (at L2′). In addition to the L2′ (i.e., α4-Ile268)
and α4-intrasubunit (i.e., α4-Lys246) sites, ketamine
overlaps β2-Ile287 (at the α4/β2-intersubunit site).
In the case of ELIC, the intersubunit site closer to the cytoplasmic
end of the TMD overlaps the α4/β2-intersubunit site presented
in this work. In particular, the bromo form interacts with M3-Ile278,
M3-Ile282, and M1-Trp225, corresponding to the residues (i.e., β2-Ile287,
β2-Val291, and α4-Tyr238, respectively) in contact with
either mecamylamine enantiomer at the (α4)2(β2)3-TMD (Table ).

Many different
rearrangements in the conformation of the AChR have
been proposed to be responsible for channel opening after agonist
activation. One of them states that the rotation of the M2 segments
around their helix axis is important for channel gating,− whereas others argue that the switching of the hydrophobic residues
located along the closed ion channel (especially between positions
9′ and 17′) to polar residues in the open state is important
for channel conductivity., On the basis of these
two models, we hypothesized that binding of mecamylamine to the NL
sites may impede the rotation of the M2 segments, disrupting the hydrophobic
to polar residue switching, finally maintaining the receptor in a
nonconducting conformation.

Previous results indicated that
(S)-(+)-mecamylamine
is more effective than the (R)-(−)-mecamylamine
in inhibiting (α4)3(β2)2 AChRs,
and that it also potentiates the agonist-induced activation of (α4)2(β2)3 AChRs. The
observed differences in binding site locations may explain the distinct
pharmacologic activity of each isomer at each stoichiometry. For example,
on the basis of the NMR and docking studies, we found that (R)-(−)-mecamylamine binds to the α4-TM3-intrasubunit
site at the (α4)3(β2)2-TMD that
is not found for (S)-(+)-mecamylamine. In this regard,
this site may be related to the inhibitory activity mediated by (R)-(−)-mecamylamine on the (α4)3(β2)2 AChR.

On
the basis of our NMR studies, pentameric assemblies of α4β2-TMDs
undergo substantial dynamics. The same feature has also been observed
in the human α1 glycine and human
α7 TMDs. The intrinsic motion of
the pentameric α4β2-TMD structure may contribute to the
relatively small chemical shift changes upon drug binding.

Our
findings provide the first insight into the direct molecular
interactions between the mecamylamine enantiomers and the hα4β2-TMD
stoichiometries. The application of several approaches allowed us
to characterize different L and NL binding sites for each mecamylamine
enantiomer. These findings are valuable for the understanding of the
allosteric modulation elicited by each enantiomer, and this basic
knowledge could be beneficial for the development of novel therapies
for the treatment of several neurological disorders involving α4β2
AChRs.
