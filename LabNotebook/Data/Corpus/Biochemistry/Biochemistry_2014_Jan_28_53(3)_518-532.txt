The Ras and
Rho families of
small GTPases are subfamilies of the Ras superfamily. The Ras family of small GTPases includes Harvey Ras (HRas),
Neuroblastoma Ras, and Kirsten Ras. Ras-dependent
cellular signals control cell growth and division., Rac1
and other proteins, such as RhoA, RhoC, and Cdc42, belong to the Rho
family of small GTPases. These Rho proteins
modulate various cellular functions, including cell polarity, vesicular
trafficking, and the cell cycle., Various diseases, including
cancer, are linked to misregulation of the cellular signaling events
associated with Ras and Rho GTPases.,−

A variety of regulators govern the cycle between the biologically
active GTP- and inactive GDP-bound forms of these small GTPase proteins.
These regulators include guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)
and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). GAPs downregulate the level of activity of small GTPases by stimulating
the intrinsically slow rate of GTP hydrolysis, populating small GTPases
in their inactive GDP-bound form. Conversely, GEFs upregulate the
function of small GTPases by promoting the dissociation of the bound
GDP from small GTPases. This dissociation allows small GTPases to
bind with cellularly abundant GTP to generate the active GTP-bound
state of small GTPases in vivo.

A number of Ras-specific GEF
(RasGEF) proteins have been identified.
These include Son of Sevenless (SOS, originally named the Drosophila gene product of Son of Sevenless), Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing
factor (RasGRF), and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing
protein (RasGRP). The general architecture
of these related RasGEFs is conserved sequentially and structurally
within the catalytic core domain Cdc25. Nevertheless, both SOS and RasGRF also possess the noncatalytic
regulatory domains of Dbl homology (DH) and the Pleckstrin homology
(PH). However, RasGRP lacks these regulatory domains. The DH domains of these RasGEFs are homologuous to the
catalytic domain of the Rho-specific GEF (RhoGEF) proteins that may
endow these RasGEFs with Rho-specific GEF activity in addition to
the RasGEF function. A PH domain that
connects directly to a DH domain interacts with the plasma membrane. The current model of the mechanism for the activation
of RasGEF is that, by the binding of the RasGEF to the plasma membrane,
the PH/DH domain-mediated allosteric inhibition of RasGEF is released,
resulting in activation of the RasGEF.

Dbl’s big sister (Dbs) that possesses DH and PH domains
is known as a RhoGEF specific to RhoA and RhoC as well as to Cdc42. Vav,
another RhoGEF composed of several domains that have been implicated
in protein–protein interactions in addition to the DH and PH
domains, has been shown to be broadly active with several Rho GTPases,
such as Rac, RhoA, and Cdc42. However, it is most active with Rac1.

Biologically important oxidants include
the superoxide anion radical
(O2•–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the hydroxyl radical, nitric oxide (NO), and
nitrogen dioxide (•NO2). Among them, O2•– and •NO2 are capable of enhancing the dissociation
of GDP from redox-sensitive Ras and Rho proteins., In Ras proteins, these oxidants target the site of the Cys118 (HRas numbering) in the NKCD motif. In Rho GTPases, the Cys18 (Rac1 numbering) in the GXXXXGK(S/T)C
motif serves as their target site. Intriguingly,
the redox-mediated enhancement of Ras GDP dissociation is often coupled
with S-nitrosation at the Cys118 side chain of Ras (Ras-SNO)., Despite the lack of clarity about the cellular conditions necessary
to produce Ras-SNO, it is easily formed when Ras is continuously exposed
to oxidants such as •NO2 in the presence
of NO. Nonetheless, because Ras-SNO does
not react with oxidants such as O2•– and •NO2, some researchers have speculated
that Ras-SNO formation terminates the redox regulation of Ras GTPases.

The mechanisms of the regulation of Ras
and Rho GTPases by their
GEF alone or by an oxidant alone are well-established. However, it is less clear how redox sensitive Ras and Rho
GTPases are regulated when a GEF and oxidants are both present at
the same time. Although the sensitivity of the catalytic action of
Cdc25 to oxidants has been reported, the
biological significance of the kinetic and mechanistic features of
this sensitivity remains unclear. No report exists of the redox sensitivity
of the catalytic action of RhoGEFs. This study examined the redox
properties of the catalytic core domain Cdc25 of RasGEFs as well as
those of RhoGEFs Vav2 with the DH and PH domains and of the cysteine-rich
domains (Vav2 DPC) and those of the Dbs with the DH and PH domains
(Dbs DH/PH). The result clarifies the regulation of Ras activity by
RasGEFs associated with Ras Cys51 in the presence of an
oxidant. Moreover, this study also explains some earlier enigmatic
findings about the inhibitory effect of the oxidant NO in regulating
the cellular activity of Ras− in which NO typically upregulates
the cellular activity of Ras.− Finally, this study notes the redox inert features
of Vav2 DPC and Dbs DH/PH.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Conditions
The presence of transition
metals in an assay mixture often converts biologically relevant oxidants
into other molecules via the Haber–Weiss reaction and the Fenton
reaction., Removal of transition metals from the assay
mixture to prevent these Haber–Weiss and Fenton reactions ensures
the desired oxidant concentrations and also blocks generation of byproducts. Moreover, most of the biologically relevant
oxidants are highly reactive with O2. The reaction of oxidants
with O2 not only depletes the effective oxidant concentrations
but also often generates unwanted byproducts. However, despite the aerobic conditions of this cellular reaction,
the cellularly produced oxidant effectively targets redox-sensitive
proteins such as Ras.− The spatial proximity between the redox-sensitive
proteins and the oxidant-producing proteins (e.g., nitric oxide synthase) is one of the cellular features that may be
responsible for directing the oxidant to target redox-sensitive proteins
while minimizing its side reaction with O2. However, such
a cellular proximity feature cannot be easily mimicked in in vitro
assay approaches.

Although an anaerobic experimental condition—an
experimental condition that lacks O2—is apparently
atypical in biologically relevant kinetic studies, it is nevertheless
one recourse for the mimicking of cellular reaction conditions. This
is because the anaerobic condition minimizes the reaction of an oxidant
with O2 during the course of in vitro assays. To prevent undesirable decay or conversions
of oxidants during the time periods of the experiments, all experiments
were performed under transition metal-free anaerobic experimental
conditions. Residual transition metals on the surface of all assay
equipment, including vials and cuvettes used in experiments, were
removed by soaking them in 1 N HCl for 1 day and then thoroughly rinsing
them with double-distilled water. A transition metal-free assay buffer
was prepared by passing a solution containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM diethylenetriaminepentaacetate,
and 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.4) through a column packed with Bio-Rad Chelex-100
cation exchange resin. The highest grade of pure MgCl2 (5
mM) was then added to the transition metal-free solution. All purified
protein samples (see below) were dialyzed with the transition metal-free
assay buffer to produce transition metal-free protein samples.

O2-free rubber serum stopper-sealed assay vials containing
the transition metal-free buffer and small GTPase protein samples
were prepared in an N2-filled anaerobic glovebox (O2 concentrations &lt;3 PPM). GEF protein samples (Cdc25, Vav2
DPC, and Dbs DH/PH) as well as the fluorescence-tagged Ras proteins
complexed with Cdc25 stocks in O2-free rubber serum stopper-sealed
assay vials were also prepared in this N2-filled anaerobic
glovebox. All syringes were flushed with N2 before being
used to transfer buffer, reagents, or proteins from the stock vials
to the assay cuvettes.

Generation and Quantification of O2•–
KO2 was used as a
source for the generation
of O2•–. The KO2 stock
solution (∼3.6 mM) was prepared in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide
essentially as described in the previous study. Anaerobic KO2 and H2O2 stock solutions were prepared by placing the KO2 and
H2O2 solutions in a sealed vial, applying a
vacuum, and then using a vacuum manifold to flush them three times
with N2. A fraction of the KO2 solution (e.g.,
∼1–2 μL) was transferred to an anaerobically sealed
assay vial that contained an assay buffer (1 mL). The O2•– concentration in the assay vial was then
measured using unmodified ferricytochrome c as described
in the previous study. In brief, a fraction
of the assay solution containing KO2 was transferred to
an anaerobically sealed vial that contained oxidized ferricytochrome c (10 μL). The change in wavelength of 550 nm against
557 nm that occurred because of the reduction of ferricytochrome c was then monitored with a spectrophotometer. The value
of the spectra of cytochrome c (550 nm minus 557
nm) provided the concentration of O2•– derived from KO2 in the assay solution. The cytochrome c concentrations were calculated from the absorption coefficient
of 21 mM–1 cm–1.

Protein Sample Preparations
Except
for the commercially
available superoxide dismutase (SOD, from bovine erythrocytes, Sigma),
all protein samples used were prepared using human origin constructs.
The C-terminus truncated version of wild type (wt) HRas (1–166)
conserves the structural features of the full-length wt Ras (i.e.,
Switches I and II) necessary for the binding interactions with the
full-length wt HRas effectors and regulators.− This C-terminus
truncated wt HRas construct also is stably and abundantly expressed
in Escherichia coli and thus is widely used for various
in vitro studies. Within this study, unless otherwise specified, all
experiments were conducted with the C-terminus truncated wt HRas.
Also, in all experiments, unless otherwise specified, the term “wt
Ras” describes the C-terminus truncated version of wt HRas
(1–166). As with wt Ras, single cysteine mutant Ras proteins—C51S,
C80S, and C118S—as well as a double cysteine mutant—C51S/C118S
Ras—that were constructed using the wt HRas (1–166)
were stably and abundantly expressed in E. coli.
Therefore, these cysteine mutants represent versions of C-terminus
truncated HRas. However, the C-terminus double cysteine mutant—C181S/C184S—was
constructed using full-length wt HRas (1–189). Therefore, C181S/C184S
Ras protein represents a full-length HRas mutant protein, whereas
the full-length wt Ras denotes the full-length wt HRas. The expressions
of the full-length wt and C181S/C184S HRas proteins in E.
coli were not as abundant as in these C-terminus truncated
versions; this may have been because of the instability of these C-terminus
HRas residues (167–189). Nevertheless, their expressions were
sufficient for the planned experiments. When necessary, the control
of C181S/C184S Ras, the full-length wt Ras, is noted as it is. A Cdc25
construct of human RasGRF1 (564–1049) was used with this study.
The advantage in using Cdc25, instead of the whole RasGEF (such as
SOS), was to pinpoint whether the target action of the oxidant is
linked directly to the catalytic action of RasGEFs. Moreover, because
Cdc25 represents the catalytic core domain of these RasGEFs, the result
associated with Cdc25 generally applies as well to the catalytic action
of these RasGEF proteins.

All Ras constructs, as well as the
Cdc25 construct, were expressed as a maltose-binding protein (MBP)-fusion
protein from the pMAL vector (New England Biolabs). They were purified
from E. coli as described by the vendor. Ras and
Cdc25 proteins were isolated by using a Q-Sepharose column after cleavage
of the fusion proteins by using the protease supplied by the manufacturer.
To produce a Ras-SNO, wt Ras (10 mL of ∼10 μM) was transferred
for 30 min into a sealed vial (100 mL) containing a mixture of NO
and O2. The mixture of NO and O2 in a sealed
vial was prepared by purging NO gas for 5 min, followed by an injection
of air (50 mL) into the NO-filled sealed vial while simultaneously
venting the vial to release the increased air pressure that resulted.
The NO/O2-treated Ras was passed through a G-25 size exclusion
column (1.5 × 7 cm) to remove denatured Ras proteins. An estimation
of the Ras-SNO characteristic peak at 542 nm (an extinction coefficient
(ε) of 0.020 cm–1 mM–1) gave the fraction of Ras-SNO in the NO/O2-treated Ras sample as ∼0.7. As this fraction indicated,
not all of the Ras was S-nitrosated. This was likely because a certain
fraction (0.2–0.3) of the sulfur atom of the Cys118 side chain of the as-purified Ras exists in various oxidized states,
such as sulfinate and sulfonate. These
oxidized forms of Ras are redox inert; thus, they did not affect the
experiment results. The Ras-SNO is stable unless otherwise illuminated
by high energy UV light (i.e., &gt;260 nm)., Given that Ras-SNO was not exposed to UV light during the experiments,
the decomposition of Ras-SNO was not expected.

wt Ras and its
mutant proteins were tagged with rhodamine fluorescence
as described in the previous study. The
fluorescence-tagged Ras proteins complexed with Cdc25 were generated
essentially as described in the previous study.

Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged
wt Rho
GTPases—such as Rac1 (1–177), RhoA (1–181), RhoC
(1–193) in the pGEX vector—were expressed in and purified
from E. coli by using the GST gene fusion system
supplied by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Rho GTPases were isolated
by using the factory-provided GSTrap followed by thrombin digestion
as indicated in the vendor’s protocol. The Vav2 DPC (1–573)
and The Dbs DH/PH (525–1097) construct, expression, and purification
were essentially the same as described in the previous studies. Tritium-labeled guanosine diphosphate ([3H]GDP) was diluted with unlabeled GDP, giving ∼4000
dpm/μM [3H]GDP. When necessary, [3H]GDP
was loaded on Ras and Rho GTPases as described previously.

Kinetic Assay
A syringe flushed
with N2 was
used to add an anaerobically prepared oxidant or GEF protein (e.g.,
Cdc25) to the anaerobically sealed assay cuvettes that contained small
GTPase loaded with [3H]GDP in the presence and absence
of SOD in the transition metal-free assay buffer. Simultaneous treatment
with GEF and an oxidant was done by introducing GEF, followed immediately
by an oxidant, into the assay cuvettes containing [3H]GDP-loaded
small GTPase in an assay buffer. When necessary, this sequence was
reversed, first introducing an oxidant, followed immediately by GEF.
Aliquots of the assay sample were then withdrawn with a syringe at
specific times and spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane filters. These
filters were then washed three times with an assay buffer. The radioactivity
of the nitrocellulose membrane filters was measured with a scintillation
counter (Beckman). When necessary to perturb any potential binding
interaction between GEF and GTPase, GEF (50 nM) was pretreated with
an oxidant (e.g., O2•–, 5 μM)
in the presence of GTPase (1 μM) under anaerobic conditions,
quenched with excess ascorbic acid (1 mM), and then treated with 100
mM (NH4)2SO4. The (NH4)2SO4-treated protein sample was concentrated
with an Amicon centrifugal filter (10 kDa cut off). To isolate GTPase
from GEF protein and chemicals, the concentrated protein sample was
then passed through a gel filtration column (2.5 × 20 cm packed
with Sephadex 75).

Depending on the assay involved, a certain
fraction of [3H]GDP was dissociated from small GTPases
by treatment with an oxidant and/or GEF. However, complete dissociation
did not occur, even over an extended period (e.g., 1 h). One possible
reason for this incomplete dissociation is that, although the GTPase
protein samples used were more than 95% pure (judged by SDS-PAGE),
the structure and/or redox-sensitive motif of the used GTPase samples
was not entirely homogeneous. For example, a certain fraction of the
redox-sensitive cysteine residues of Ras proteins that are coupled
with the Ras GDP dissociation was in a redox inert oxidation state
(sulfenic acid, sulfinate, and/or sulfonate states). A Ras-specific
redox enzyme has not been reported; however, it is possible that in
cells these redox inert states can be reversed by the action of various
redox enzymes such as thioredoxin, peroxiredoxin, and sulfiredoxin.
However, the in vitro assay used for this study lacked such redox
enzymes. Therefore, the presence of a desensitized fraction of Ras
in an assay mixture reduced the quantity of the redox-mediated dissociation
of the bound [3H]GDP from Ras. It is not unprecedented
for a fraction of GDP to remain unassociated from Ras when treated
with an oxidant. Another possible explanation
is that a fraction of the oxidation reaction of the redox-sensitive
residue of Ras does not always couple with the mechanical perturbation
of the Ras nucleotide-binding interaction. For example, a fraction
of the thiyl radical generated by the reaction of a redox-sensitive
cysteine of Ras with an oxidant (e.g., O2•–) reacts instead with another O2•– to produce a redox inert oxidized form of Ras. This cysteine oxidation
does not couple with the dissociation of [3H]GDP from Ras.

The fluorescence-based binding assays under anaerobic conditions
were performed by titration of the rhodamine-tagged Ras Cdc25 binary
complex with KO2. This was described in the previous study, except that Cdc25 was used instead of Raf-RBD.
KO2 was repeatedly injected into the anaerobically sealed
assay cuvettes containing the rhodamine-tagged Ras complexed with
Cdc25. The change in fluorescence emission intensity at 545 nm, followed
by excitation at 490 nm because of the dissociation by KO2 of Cdc25 from the rhodamine-tagged Ras, was then monitored with
a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 Fluorescence spectrometer.

Data Analyses
Three independent measurements were performed for each set of experiments
(e.g., wt Ras). When necessary, the values were normalized against
the value of the initial untreated sample that was set at 1.0. For
purposes of graphic presentation, the mean values of each data point
were then calculated, along with the corresponding standard deviations
(SD) from these independent triple measurements. Depending on the
experimental set, the values were plotted against either time (e.g.,
s) or concentration of an effector(s) (e.g., KO2). The
plot was further fitted to a proper kinetic model—the one-phase
exponential decay or the one-site binding (hyperbola)—to statistically
analyze and then estimate various kinetic parameters. Briefly, for
each data set of the triple independent measurements, Prism software
was used to perform a two-tailed variance ratio test (F test) for a null hypothesis (H0) “one curve is
for all data sets” and an alternative hypothesis (HA) “one curve is not for all data sets” with a P value &lt; 0.05. This test evaluates whether the individual
curves are statistically distinguishable with a 95% confidence interval.
Once the result of the F test does not reject the
null hypothesis, Prism software was used to find the global fit, finding
one shared (among data sets) best-fit value for all triple independent
measurements for each parameter. These values include the rate constant,
the apparent inhibition constant (appKI), or the dissociation constant (KD). The fittings also provide the SD of each of the determined
parameters as well as the regression values (r2) of the global fits.

To test the difference between
the kinetic parameters obtained
from each set of experiments (e.g., wt Ras versus C118S Ras), Prism
software was used to perform a two-sample t test
for a two-tailed H0 “one parameter is for all data
sets” and an HA “one parameter is not for
all data sets” with a P value &lt; 0.05.

Kinetic parameters of reactions include the rate constant and the
span. Such parameters can be obtained by fitting the reaction data
to the kinetic model “one phase exponential decay” (see
above). However, unlike their rate constants, spans are often omitted
in the description of reactions. This is because, in the absence of
any other reaction limitation, the span of the complete reaction asymptotically
reaches 1 (in terms of the fraction of the total reaction substrate).
The span within this study is defined as the total quantity GTPase
GDP dissociation in the time period for a given reaction. Under optimal
conditions, the quantity of the usage of GEF does not control the
span of the GEF-mediated Ras GDP dissociation—which is expected
to be near 1. This is because, up until the reaction is completed
to reach span 1, the presence of any amount of whatsoever of the enzyme
GEF will be continuously recycled. However, how much of an oxidant
is used determines the span of the oxidant-mediated Ras GDP dissociation,
which is expected to vary. This is because, unlike GEFs, the inorganic
oxidant cannot be recycled but is consumed in the course of the turnover
of the facilitation of the GTPase GDP dissociation. Adding more of
the oxidant generates more of the GTPase GDP dissociation and thus
yields a bigger span. For example, the span of the wt Ras GDP dissociation
by O2•– can be further increased
by multiple additions of O2•– during
the assay time period or by using the xanthine oxidase system that
continuously generates O2•– over
the assay time period (not shown).

However, characterization
of the completion of the oxidant-mediated
Ras GDP dissociation is outside the scope of this study, which aims
instead to clarify the effect an oxidant has on the catalytic action
of GEFs on these GTPases. Nonetheless, when the quantity of oxidant
to be used for assays is set, the span—an indicator of the
amount of the GTPase GDP dissociation by the oxidant—can be
used as a signature feature of the oxidant-mediated GTPase GDP dissociation.
Accordingly, this study used a fixed concentration of an oxidant,
rather than multiple additions of oxidants or of the xanthine oxidase
system. A certain fraction of Ras and Rho GTPases was denatured in
the presence of oxidant concentrations higher than 10 μM (see
Figure  in ). To minimize denaturation of these GTPases during the assay time,
∼3 μM of oxidant was uniformly used for all assays unless
otherwise noted.

When the oxidant concentration is fixed, not
only the rate constant
but also the span of the oxidant-mediated GTPase GDP dissociation
may differ from the rate constant and the span of the GEF-mediated
GTPase GDP dissociation. If the spans between one reaction and another
differ, visual comparison of the reaction rates (expressed as rate
constants) between these two reactions is confusing. As illustrated
in Figure , reaction 1 appears slower than
reaction 3. In fact, however, these rates are the same. This illusion
of difference is because of the 2-fold smaller span of reaction 1
compared with the span of reaction 3. Furthermore, reaction 2 appears
slower than reaction 3. This apparent difference also is misleading.
In fact, the rate of reaction 2 is 2-fold faster than the rate of
reaction 3, yet the span of reaction 2 is 2-fold smaller than the
span of reaction 3. Similarly, reaction 2 appears much slower than
reaction 4. However, their rates are actually the same; nonetheless,
the span of reaction 2 is simply 2-fold smaller than the span of reaction
4. To avoid such confusion, we provide not only the rate constant
values but also the span values of the oxidant- and the GEF-mediated
GTPase GDP dissociations, along with their corresponding figures.

Evaluation
of the kinetic rate constant associated with the span
of the reaction. Each line represents a reaction with (a) a 0.5 rate
constant and a 0.5 span; (b) a 1.0 rate constant and a 0.5 span; (c)
a 0.5 rate constant and a 1.0 span; and (d) a 1.0 rate constant and
a 1.0 span.

Results
To assess
any potential effect of oxidants on the catalytic function
of the GEF proteins of Ras and Rho GTPases, two kinetic parameters—a
rate constant and a span—were determined and analyzed for the
GDP dissociation from Ras and Rho GTPases in the presence and absence
of GEFs and/or various oxidants. When necessary, values were determined
for the oxidant concentration that gives the maximal inhibition of
the catalytic action of GEFs on small GTPases. This is equivalent
to the minimal velocity (appVmin) of the GEF-mediated GDP dissociation from small GTPases. Values
also were determined for appKI of an oxidant in its effect on the catalytic action of GEF on GTPases
as well as for KD of an oxidant for small
GTPases complexed with GEF. These parameters also aid evaluation of
the potential effect of oxidants on the catalytic function of the
GEF proteins of Ras and Rho GTPases. wt Ras and various Ras mutants
as well as wt Rac1 and wt RhoC were used for this study. Cdc25 was
used as a Ras GEF. Vav2 DPC and Dbs DH/PH were used for Rho GEFs.

Apparent
Inhibition of the Oxidant-Mediated Catalytic Action
of Cdc25 on wt Ras GTPase
wt Ras GDP dissociation was enhanced
by Cdc25, which is consistent with previous reports. wt Ras GDP dissociation also was enhanced by KO2 alone (Figure ). The KO2-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation was abolished by treatment with SOD (Table ), suggesting that O2•–—derived from KO2—is the active species
to facilitate wt Ras GDP dissociation. The effect of O2•– and its nullification by SOD are consistent
with the previous result. The values
of the rate constant and the span of the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP
dissociation are, respectively, 5.4-fold smaller and 1.2-fold larger
than the values of the rate constant and the span of the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation (Table ). These rate constants indicate that, under experimental
conditions, the rate of wt Ras GDP dissociation by Cdc25 is slower
than the rate of wt Ras GDP dissociation by O2•–. The span values indicate that, under experimental conditions, the
quantity of the wt Ras GDP dissociation by Cdc25 exceeds that by O2•–. Unlike the dissociation rate
constant, the reaction span is not an intrinsic kinetic characteristic
of each reaction. Nevertheless, such a span difference occurred. This
occurrence is because, as detailed in the kinetic analysis section
of , the total treated
quantity of KO2 (i.e., ∼3 μM) that produces
the active radical species O2•– for the wt Ras GDP dissociation was simply insufficient to complete
the wt Ras GDP dissociation. In contrast, a relatively small amount
of the enzyme, Cdc25 (50 nM), was recycled during the assay time period
to reach the maximal span.

Effect of oxidants on the Cdc25-mediated GDP
dissociation from
wt Ras and C118S Ras. (A) Independent triple filter-binding assays
were performed to measure the radioactivity of the [3H]GDP
that remained to bind to Ras after treatment of the [3H]GDP-loaded
wt Ras (1 μM) with or without a regulator(s), including Cdc25
(50 nM) and/or KO2 (∼3 μM), for the times
given in . (B) The identical
independent triple filter-binding assays with or without the regulator(s),
as described for panel A, also were performed for the [3H]GDP-loaded C118S Ras (1 μM). All of these triple measurements
of radioactivity values measured at different times were normalized
against the radioactivity value of the initial sample mixture (time
= 0 s), which was set at 1.0. The one-phase exponential decay model
(P &lt; 0.05) was used to perform F tests on each data set of the triple measurements. The F tests indicated there was no significant curve difference within
any data set of the triple measurements. Accordingly, mean values
and their corresponding SD from each of the triple measurements are
represented in panels A and B of this figure. The one-phase exponential
decay model (P &lt; 0.05) was used to obtain kinetic
values, including kinetic rate constants and spans from the plots,
for global fits for each of the triple data sets. Global fits give
kinetic values and SD with r2 of fit of
&gt;0.9050. These values are summarized in Table .

exception is that the Ras-containing assay vial was pretreated with
SOD (5000 units), as noted in . The values with SD of the rate constant and the span of GDP dissociation
from wt Ras and C118S Ras, with and without Cdc25 in the presence
of H2O2, were obtained as described in Figure , except that H2O2 (10 μM)
was used instead of KO2. All listed values with SD of the
rate constant and the span of GDP dissociation from wt Ras-SNO, with
and without Cdc25, KO2, and/or H2O2 in the presence and absence of SOD, also were determined, with one
exception, as described in Figure  and in
this Table ; the exception was the use of
wt Ras-SNO instead of C118S Ras. To examine the significance of the
potential similarity or difference among these rate constant values
listed in Table 1, t tests with P &lt; 0.05 were performed as described in . Briefly, any values denoted by the letter “a”
correspond to other values denoted with “a”. The same
is true for the values denoted with the letters “b”,
“c”, “d”, and “e”. However,
any values denoted with “a” differ from the values denoted
by “b”, “c”, “d”, and “e”.
The same applies for “b” with “c”, “d”,
and “e”; and for “c” with “d”
and “e”; and for “d” with “e”.
All of the t test results associated with the rate
constants were exactly the same with the t test results
for the corresponding span values. Therefore, for clarity of presentation,
the t tests for the span value analyses are not shown.
ND, not determined.

Facilitation
of wt Ras GDP dissociation also was observed in the
presence of both Cdc25 and O2•– together (Figure ). If O2•– does not affect the catalytic action of the
Ras GEF Cdc25 on wt Ras or vice versa, the values of the rate constant
and the span of the wt Ras GDP dissociation in the presence of Cdc25
and O2•– together will be a numerical
sum. This sum is the total of the rate constant and the span values
of the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation and the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation. However,
the values of the rate constant and the span of the Cdc25/O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation approximate
the values of the rate constant and the span of the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation. Nevertheless,
they are not equivalent to the sum of the values of the rate constant
and the span of the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation and the
O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation
(Table ).

The O2•–-dominant kinetic features
can be quenched by addition to the assay of the O2•–-scavenger SOD containing both Cdc25 and O2•–. In this assay, the values of
the kinetic constant and the span of the Cdc25/O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation in the presence of SOD were similar
to the values of the kinetic constant and the span of the Cdc25-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation (Table ). The best
explanations for these results are (i) O2•– interferes with the catalytic action of Cdc25 on the wt Ras GDP
dissociation, so that the kinetic characteristics of the Cdc25-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation were fated; and (ii) O2•– continuously facilitates wt Ras GDP dissociation in the presence
of Cdc25 that exhibits the signatures of the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation. Accordingly, we hypothesize that
O2•– inhibits the Cdc25-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation. However, Cdc25 has no effect on the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation.

The wt Ras GDP dissociation was not facilitated by H2O2 (Table ), which is consistent
with the previous result. The Cdc25-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation also was unaffected by other oxidants, such
as H2O2 (Table ). The
result suggests that both the intrinsic and the Cdc25-mediated wt
Ras GDP dissociation are insensitive to H2O2. Nonetheless, the inability of H2O2 to inhibit
the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation clarifies that the oxidant-mediated
inhibition of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras is O2•– specific.

Deconvolution of the Oxidant-Mediated
Inhibition of the Catalytic
Action of Cdc25 on wt Ras GTPase
It would be challenging
to validate the effect of O2•– on the Cdc25-mediated facilitation of the wt Ras GDP dissociation
through monitoring of the GDP dissociation from wt Ras. This is because,
although O2•– apparently inhibits
the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation, it directly facilitates
the wt Ras GDP dissociation.

To isolate the effect of O2•– on the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP
dissociation from the direct effect of O2•– on the wt Ras GDP dissociation, the C118S Ras mutant and the S-nitrosated
wt Ras on Cys118 side chain (wt Ras-SNO) were used instead
of wt Ras. This substitution was made because O2•– is unable to facilitate the GDP dissociation from C118S Ras and
wt Ras-SNO (Figure B and Table ). This inability is because C118S Ras lacks the redox-sensitive
Cys118, whereas the SNO moiety of wt Ras-SNO is redox inert
against O2•–. Moreover, the values of the rate constant and span of the
Cdc25-mediated GDP dissociation from C118S Ras and wt Ras-SNO were
similar to those of the rate constant and span of the Cdc25-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation (Figure B and Table ). The results suggest that the mutated Ser residue
in C118S Ras and the SNO moiety of the Cys118 side chain
of wt Ras do not alter the catalytic function of Cdc25 on Ras. Collectively,
kinetic data of C118S Ras and wt Ras-SNO can be used to deconvolute
the sole potential inhibition effect of O2•– on the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation from the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation.

The values of the rate constant and the span of the Cdc25-mediated
C118S Ras GDP dissociation in the presence of O2•– were 2.6- and 1.3-fold smaller than the rate constant and span of
the Cdc25-mediated C118S Ras GDP dissociation in the absence of O2•– (Figure B and Table ). However, treatment with SOD
abolished the decreases in the rate constant and the span of the Cdc25-mediated
C118S Ras GDP dissociation by O2•– (Table ). Identical biochemical results
were obtained by using wt Ras-SNO instead of C118S Ras (Table ). These results suggest that O2•– perturbs the catalytic function of Cdc25 on
C118S Ras and wt Ras-SNO. This supports a hypothesis that O2•– inhibits the catalytic action of Cdc25
on wt Ras.

The inhibition of the rate constant and span of the
Cdc25-mediated
C118S Ras GDP dissociation by O2•– was hardly significant (Table ). To determine
the effective inhibition concentrations of O2•– on the catalytic action of Cdc25 on C118S Ras, the mixture of C118S
Ras and Cdc25 was titrated with various concentrations of O2•–. The appVmin value—equivalent to the value of the maximal
O2•–-mediated inhibition—of
the catalytic action of Cdc25 on C118S Ras was determined to occur
at an O2•– concentration of 27
μM (Figure ). The appKI value of O2•– for C118S Ras in the presence
of Cdc25 was estimated to be 2.3 μM (Figure ). This result explains why the default O2•– concentration (∼3 μM, see the  section) caused only partial
inhibition of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on C118S Ras.

Determination
of the apparent inhibition constant of KO2 for C118S and
C51S/C118S Ras in the presence and absence of Cdc25.
Independent triple equilibrium titrations of [3H]GDP-loaded
C118S and C51S/C118S Ras (1 μM) with various concentrations
of KO2 (between 0 and 20 μM) were performed in the
presence and absence of Cdc25 (50 nM). The KO2-treated
samples were then incubated for 250 s, and their radioactivity values
associated with the Ras-bound [3H]GDP were determined as
described in Figure . All radioactivity values
measured were normalized against the radioactivity value of the Ras
sample without treatment of KO2. This radioactivity value
was set at 1.0. The F tests with a linear regression
model (P &lt; 0.05), but not the hyperbola model
(P &lt; 0.05), support one curve for each set of
the triple data of C118S and C51S/C118S Ras with KO2 in
the absence of Cdc25. Mean values and the SD from each of the triple
measurements of C118S and C51S/C118S Ras with KO2 in the
absence of Cdc25 are shown in this figure. The F tests
(P &lt; 0.05) for each data set of the triple measurements
of C118S and C51S/C118S Ras with KO2 in the presence of
Cdc25 indicate the insignificant curve difference within each of these
triple measurements. The global fits for each of these triple data
with the hyperbola model (P &lt; 0.05) determined
the KO2 concentrations that give appVmin values of the catalytic action of Cdc25
on C118S and C51S/C118S Ras, respectively, to be 27 ± 7 and 6
± 2 μM. The global fitting also gave appKI values of KO2 for C118S and C51S/C118S
Ras in the presence of Cdc25, respectively, of 2.3 ± 1 and &gt;100.7
± 34 μM [KO2]. The r2 values associated with fit were &gt;0.9065. Note that when the O2•– concentrations were higher than
∼10 μM, these Ras proteins were partly denatured. This
Ras denaturation complicates fitting these values to a curve. Therefore,
kinetic values beyond O2•– concentrations
higher than ∼10 μM were ignored for ease of fit to the
curve. However, as a way to present the original data, the kinetic
values associated with O2•– concentrations
beyond 10 μM, including 20 μM, are shown in this figure.

Intriguingly, although C118S Ras
lacks Cys118 and wt
Ras-SNO possesses the chemically modified redox inert Cys118 side chain, O2•– was able to
perturb the Cdc25-mediated GDP dissociation from C118S Ras and wt
Ras-SNO. Therefore, these results constitute another piece of critical
evidence that the residue associated with the redox feature of Ras
Cys118 is not involved in the O2•–-mediated inhibition of the Cdc25-mediated catalysis of the wt Ras
GDP dissociation.

Role of Ras Cys51 in the Oxidant-Dependent
Inhibition
of the Cdc25-Mediated wt Ras GDP Dissociation
Full-length
HRas has a total of five cysteines: Cys51, Cys80, Cys118, Cys181, and Cys184. As
noted elsewhere, Ras Cys118 is well-known as a direct target
of an oxidant such as O2•–, resulting
in enhancement of the GDP dissociation from Ras., However, it is unclear if any of these Ras cysteines play a role
in how O2•– inhibits the catalytic
action of Cdc25.

To determine if Ras Cys51 has a
role in the O2•–-mediated inhibition
of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras, we examined the kinetic
properties of the Ras mutant C51S in the presence and absence of Cdc25
and/or O2•–. In contrast to the
results associated with wt Ras (Figure A and
Table ), the rate constant and the span of
the GDP dissociation from C51S Ras by Cdc25 and O2•– together approximated the sum of the individual
rate constants and the spans of the GDP dissociation from C51S Ras
by Cdc25 and by O2•– (Figure A and Table ). Nevertheless,
the values of the rate constants and the spans of the intrinsic, the
Cdc25-mediated, and the O2•–-mediated
C51Ras GDP dissociation (Figure A) were, respectively,
similar to those of the values of the intrinsic, Cdc25-mediated, and
O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation.
These results suggest that, although Ras Cys51 has no role
in either the wt Ras GDP binding interaction or in the O2•–- and Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation,
the Ras residue Cys51 is involved in the O2•–-mediated inhibition of the catalytic action
of Cdc25 on Ras. Given that O2•– targets Ras Cys51 rather than Cdc25 to inhibit the catalytic
action of Cdc25 on wt Ras, it follows that the mechanism of the O2•–-mediated inhibition of the catalytic
action of Cdc25 on wt Ras is that O2•– targets Ras Cys51, which in turn renders Ras insensitive
to Cdc25.

Effect of KO2 on the Cdc25-mediated GDP dissociation
from C51S and C51S/C118S Ras. (A) All experimental methods and data
analysis procedures were identical to those described in Figure , except that C51S Ras was used instead of wt Ras
and C118S Ras. (B) The same experiments and analyses that are described
for panel A also were performed for C51S/C118S Ras instead of C51S
Ras. The F tests indicate that the curve differences
are insignificant within the curve of each of the triple measurements
associated with C51S and C51S/C118S Ras in the presence and absence
of an effector(s). Therefore, all values within this figure are shown
with mean values and the SD from the independent triple measurements.
Global fits for all triple data with the one-phase exponential decay
model (P &lt; 0.05) also were performed that gave
kinetic values and their corresponding SD. All kinetic values determined
are summarized in Table . The r2 values of fit were &gt;0.9015.

Data for the rate
constants and
the spans of GDP dissociation with the SD from C51S and C51/C118S
Ras mutants were taken from Figure . The values
with SD of the rate constants and the spans of GDP dissociation from
C80S and C181S/C184S Ras mutants were obtained as described in Figure , except that C80S and C181S/C184S Ras mutants were
used instead of C51S and C51/C118S Ras mutants. As with the values
in Table , t tests with P &lt; 0.05 were performed to evaluate the potential similarities
or differences among the kinetic values. Table 2 is a continuation
of Table . Therefore, the letters adopted
in Table  continue to be used in Table 2.
Also, the implications of the letters in Table 2 are exactly the same
as in Table . For example, data denoted by
the letter “a” in Table 2 are the same as the values
denoted with “a” in Tables  and
2. Conversely, data denoted with a letter “a” in both
Tables  and 2 differ from other values denoted
with other letters, such as “b”, in both Tables  and 2. This also applies to other letters in Tables  and 2. Notice that the letter “e”
in Table  does not occur in Table 2. This
is because Table 2 contains no equivalent value associated with the
letter “e” of Table . Finally,
there is no comparable value in Tables  and
2 for the value with the letter “f” of Table 2 within
Tables  and 2.

A double mutant Ras C51S/C118S was introduced to further
verify
the potential O2•–-mediated desensitizing
role that Ras Cys51 plays in the catalytic action of Cdc25
on wt Ras. The rate constant and the span of the intrinsic and the
Cdc25-mediated GDP dissociation from C51S/C118S Ras (Figure B and Table ) were similar
to that of the intrinsic and the Cdc25-mediated GDP dissociation from
wt Ras (Figure A and Table ). This result suggests that the Cys51 and Cys118 residues of wt Ras are unnecessary in the Ras nucleotide
binding interaction and also in the catalytic action of Cdc25. This
is not unusual because the Ras nucleotide binding interaction and
the catalytic action of Cdc25 were unaffected by the absence, either
separately or in combination, of the Cys51 and Cys118 residue of Ras (see above). Furthermore, the rate constant
and the span of the Ras C51S/C118S GDP dissociation by Cdc25 and O2•– together were similar to the rate
and the span of the C51S/C118S Ras GDP dissociation by Cdc25 alone
(Figure B and Table ). This similarity was unchanged even in the presence of higher concentrations
of O2•– (up to 20 μM) (Figure ). These results indicate that O2•– was unable to desensitize C51S/C118S Ras to
Cdc25. Given that the Ras mutant C51S/C118S lacks the Cys118 residue responsible for the direct O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation, whatever effect O2•– has on the GDP dissociation from C51S/C118S
Ras can be attributed solely to the absence of the Ras residue Cys51. Accordingly, the failure to desensitize C51S/C118S Ras
to Cdc25 in the presence of O2•– appears to be caused by the absence of Cys51 in C51S/C118S
Ras. These analytical results also support a hypothesis that Ras Cys51 plays a role in the O2•–-mediated desensitization of wt Ras to the catalytic action Cdc25.

Unlike Ras Cys51, Ras Cys118 was shown to
be unaffected by the O2•–-mediated
inhibition of the catalytic action of Cdc25 (see the section on the
deconvolution of the oxidant-mediated inhibition of the catalytic
action of Cdc25 on wt Ras GTPase). This result suggests that Ras Cys118 is not involved in the O2•–-mediated desensitization of wt Ras to Cdc25. However, the potential
role(s) of other Ras cysteine residues—including Cys80, Cys181, and Cys184—in the O2•–-mediated desensitization of wt Ras to
Cdc25 was unclear. The kinetic and redox properties associated with
C80S Ras GDP dissociation were exactly the same as those with wt Ras
(Table ). The result suggests that the Cys80 of Ras has no role in the O2•–-mediated desensitization of wt Ras to Cdc25. As noted in the  section, the construction
of C51S, C80S, and C118S Ras (1–166) excluded the Ras C-terminus.
However, because Cys181 and Cys184 are located
at the end of the C-terminus of the full-length wt Ras, C181S/C184S
Ras was constructed with the full-length wt Ras (1–189). Therefore,
full-length wt Ras serves as a control for C181S/C184S Ras. The kinetic
and redox properties of C181S/C184S Ras were similar to the kinetic
and redox properties of the full-length wt Ras (Table ). It is also noteworthy that the kinetic and redox properties
of the full-length wt Ras were similar to the kinetic and redox properties
of the C-terminal truncated version of wt Ras (Tables  and ). The results suggest that the
portion of the N-terminus of the full-length wt Ras that includes
the Cys181 and Cys184 residues is unnecessary
for the O2•–-mediated desensitization
of wt Ras to Cdc25. Taken as a whole, it appears that, as far as these
five Ras cysteines are concerned, only Ras Cys51 is involved
in the O2•–-mediated desensitization
of the action of Cdc25 on wt Ras.

Role of Cysteines of Cdc25
in the Oxidant-Dependent Inhibition
of the Cdc25-Mediated wt Ras GDP Dissociation
There are seven
cysteine residues in Cdc25. None has been investigated for a potential
redox role(s) of any of these Cdc25 cysteines. Given that the oxidant-dependent
inhibition of the action of Cdc25 on wt Ras depends entirely on the
presence of Ras Cys51, these Cdc25 cysteines are unlikely
to participate in the oxidant-dependent inhibition of the Cdc25-mediated
wt Ras GDP dissociation. However, the possibility that these Cdc25
cysteines have other roles, such as modulation of the activity of
Cdc25, cannot be dismissed. More studies are necessary to examine
this possibility.

The O2•–-Mediated Perturbation
of the Binding Interaction between wt Ras and Cdc25
Typically,
enzymes must bind with their substrates as a prerequisite for their
catalytic action. In accounting for the
kinetic results showing that Ras Cys51 is a central element
in the O2•–-mediated desensitization
of wt Ras to Cdc25, we hypothesize that the Ras Cys51-targeting
action of O2•– is implicated in
the perturbation of the binding interaction between Cdc25 and wt Ras
that results in desensitization of wt Ras to Cdc25.

To examine
the potential O2•–-mediated perturbation
of the binding interaction between Cdc25 and Ras via the targeting
of Ras Cys51, a binary complex of Cdc25 with the rhodamine
fluorescence-tagged wt Ras and all available cysteine mutants was
titrated with O2•– in the absence
of free GDP. Figure A shows that the rhodamine
fluorescence intensity of Cdc25 complexed with wt Ras decreased hyperbolically
with increases in the concentration of O2•–. This is an indicator of the dissociation of Cdc25 from wt Ras;
it suggests that O2•– interferes
with the binding of Cdc25 to wt Ras. The rhodamine fluorescence intensity
of Cdc25 complexed with C118S Ras also decreased hyperbolically after
treatment with O2•– (Figure A). This result suggests that Ras Cys118 is not involved in the O2•–-mediated
interference with the binding interaction between Cdc25 and Ras. Identical
results were obtained with other Ras cysteine mutants C80S and C181S/C184S
Ras (not shown). However, the O2•–-dependent decrease in rhodamine fluorescence was not observed when
either C51S or C51S/C118S Ras was used instead of wt Ras or C118S
Ras (Figure A). This result indicates that
treatment with O2•– did not enhance
dissociation of Cdc25 from C51S or C51S/C118S Ras. Accordingly, this
result suggests that the targeting action of O2•– on Ras Cys51, but not on Ras Cys80, Cys118, Cys181, and Cys184, is linked to
the perturbation of the binding interaction between Cdc25 and wt Ras.

Determination
of the KO2-mediated perturbation
of Cdc25 binding interaction with wt Ras, C118S Ras, and C51S/C118S
Ras. (A) Cdc25 complexed with rhodamine fluorescence tagged-wt Ras,
-C118S Ras, and -C51S/C118S Ras (1 μM) was treated with various
concentrations of KO2 (between 0 and 20 μM), as indicated
by the arrows. The corresponding changes in fluorescence intensity
were monitored. When necessary, a radical quencher DMPO (1 mM) or
ascorbic acid (1 mM; not shown) was added after treatment with KO2, as indicated by the arrows. (B) To ensure confidence in
the results, the experiments shown in panel A were repeated two more
times. The changes in fluorescence intensities of these triple measurement
data sets were plotted against the KO2 concentrations.
The F tests with a hyperbola model (P &lt; 0.05) support one curve for each of triple data sets. Hence,
the fluorescence values are shown in this figure with mean values
and the SD from independent triplicate measurements. The global fits
with a hyperbola model (P &lt; 0.05) gave the apparent
dissociation constants of KO2 for the wt Ras–Cdc25,
C118S Ras–Cdc25, C51S/C118S Ras–Cdc25, and C51S Ras–Cdc25
binary complexes. These constants are, respectively, 2.3 ± 0.1,
2.2 ± 0.1, &gt;20.6 ± 0.9, and &gt;20.6 ± 0.8 μM
[KO2] with r2 &gt; 0.9095.

Unlike the slow pace of the O2•–-mediated wt Ras nucleotide dissociation
(Figure A), the O2•–-mediated
wt Ras Cdc25 dissociation is more likely to be immediate (Figure A). This is possibly because the Ras Cdc25 binding
interactions are not multilayered. Also, an increase in fluorescence
intensity was observed after addition of either a radical quencher
5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) to the O2•–-treated Cdc25 complexed with the
rhodamine fluorescence-tagged wt Ras or C118S Ras (Figure A). Treatment with ascorbic acid (1 mM), instead
of DMPO, showed the same result (not shown). The thiyl radical can
be quenched by DMPO and ascorbic acid., Therefore,
this result supports the involvement of a thiyl radical in the O2•–-mediated perturbation of the binding
interaction between Cdc25 and wt Ras or C118S Ras. Given that Ras
Cys51 is the target site of the oxidant that couples with
the O2•–-mediated perturbation
of this binding interaction, the thiyl radical is likely formed on
the Ras Cys51 side chain. This result, therefore, discloses
a radical formation as an essential step involved in the O2•–-mediated perturbation of the wt Ras Cdc25
binding interaction. In addition, the fact that both DMPO and ascorbic
acid reverse the effect of O2•– on the wt Ras or C118S Ras Cdc25 complex raises the possibility
of the reversability of the O2•–-mediated perturbation of the binding interaction between Cdc25 and
Ras.

The values of the KD of O2•– for wt Ras and C118S Ras complexed
with
Cdc25, respectively, were determined to be 2.3 and 2.2 μM (Figure B). The O2•–-dependent changes in the rhodamine fluorescence intensity of C51S
and C51S/C118S Ras complexed with Cdc25 were nevertheless negligible
(Figure B). In light of these minimal changes,
the values determined for the KD of O2•– for Ras and for C118S Ras complexed
with Cdc25 may represent the sensitivity of the targeting action of
O2•– on Ras Cys51 that
interferes with both the Ras and C118S Ras binding interaction with
Cdc25. Intriguingly, these KD values of
O2•– for wt Ras and for C118S
Ras complexed with Cdc25 are similar to those of the appKI values of O2•– for wt Ras and for C118S Ras in the presence of Cdc25 (Figure ). This similarity suggests a hypothesis that the
Ras Cys51-targeting action of O2•– interferes with the binding interaction of Cdc25 with Ras and that
this interference is linked to the O2•–-mediated desensitization of wt Ras for Cdc25.

Lack of the
Oxidant-Mediated Inhibition of the RhoGEF-Mediated
GDP Dissociation from Rac1 and RhoC
To determine the effect
of oxidants on the catalytic function of the RhoGEFs, including Vav2
DPC and Dbs DH/PH or vice versa, we examined the rate of Rac1 and
RhoC GDP dissociation in the presence and absence of these GEFs and/or
H2O2 and O2•–.

wt Rac1 GDP dissociation was enhanced by its GEF Vav2 DPC
or KO2 alone (Figure ). Treatment
with SOD ended the KO2-mediated wt Rac1 GDP dissociation
(Figure ). These results suggest that either
Vav2 DPC or O2•– derived from
KO2 enables facilitation of the wt Rac1 GDP dissociation,
which is consistent with previous results. The values of the rate constant and the span of the Vav2 DPC-mediated
wt Rac1 GDP dissociation are, respectively, 6.9-fold smaller and 1.2-fold
larger than the values of the rate constant and the span of the O2•–-mediated wt Rac1 GDP dissociation
(Table ). The difference in the rate constant
values indicates that, under our experimental conditions, the rate
of the wt Rac1 GDP dissociation by Vav2 DPC is much slower than the
rate of dissociation of wt Rac1 GDP by O2•–. The difference in the span values indicates that, under these experimental
conditions, the quantity of the wt Rac1 GDP dissociation by Vav2 DPC
exceeds that by O2•–. However,
as noted in , this is
simply because the quantity of concentration treated with O2•– (∼3 μM) is insufficient
to complete the wt Rac1 GDP dissociation.

Effect of KO2 on the Rho GEF-mediated GDP dissociation
from wt Rac1. The experimental and analytical methods were identical
to those used in Figure , except that wt Rac1
(1 μM) and its GEF, Vav2 DPC (100 nM), were used instead of
wt Ras and Cdc25. The F tests with a hyperbola model
(P &lt; 0.05) indicate that the curve differences
within each of the triple data sets are insignificant. Therefore,
mean values and the SD from each of the independent triple measurements
are presented in this figure. The global fits for each of these triplicate
data with the hyperbola model (P &lt; 0.05) gave
kinetic values and their corresponding SD. The values determined for
the apparent GDP dissociation rates of Rho proteins in the presence
and absence of a regulator(s) are summarized in Table . The r2 values of all analyses
were &gt;0.9065.

wt Rac1 GDP dissociation
was significantly enhanced by a combination
of Vav2 DPC and O2•– (Figure  and Table ). In contrast
to what occurred with wt Ras with a combination of Cdc25 and O2•– (Table ), the values of the rate constant and the span of the Vav2 DPC/O2•–-mediated wt Rac1 GDP dissociation
were almost the sum of the values of the rate constant and the span
of the Vav2 DPC-mediated wt Rac1 GDP dissociation plus the O2•–-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation (Table ). For such an approximation
of the total sum to occur means neither O2•– nor Vav2 DPC, respectively, interferes with the catalytic action
of Vav2 DPC or of O2•– on wt Rac1.
These results, therefore, suggest that the catalytic action of Vav2
DPC and O2•– on the wt Rac1 GDP
dissociation is preserved even if both Vav2 DPC and O2•– are present simultaneously.

The kinetic values
of the rate constants
and the spans for GDP dissociation from wt Rac1, in the presence and
absence of Vav2 DPC and KO2, were taken from Figure . The kinetic values of the rate constants and the
spans for GDP dissociation from wt RhoC in the presence and absence
of Dbs DH/PH and KO2 also were obtained as described in
Figure , except that wt RhoC was used instead
of wt Rac1. To evaluate the significance of the potential similarities
and differences among the rate constant values listed within Table

performed as described in . Any rate constant values that refer to the letter “a”
are the same as other values coupled with the same letter “a”.
This also applies to all other letters used within Table 3. However,
any values denoted with “a” differ from the values denoted
with “b” and “c”. The values denoted by
“b” also differ from the values associated with the
letter “c”. For presentation clarity, only the t tests for the rate constants are shown. However, all of
the t test results associated with the rate constants
were exactly the same as the t test results for the
span values that correspond to the rate constants. ND, not determined.

The catalytic action of another
GEF, Dbs DH/PH, on another redox-sensitive
wt Rho GTPase, wt RhoC, was unperturbed by O2•– (Table ). O2•– also failed to perturb the catalytic action of Dbs DH/PH on wt RhoA
and on wt Cdc42 (not shown). Therefore, this conclusion concerning
the action of Vav2 DPC on wt Rac1 GDP dissociation with the oxidant
O2•– is also applicable to the
catalytic action of Dbs DH/PH on the dissociation of GDP from wt RhoA,
RhoC, and Cdc42 with O2•–.

The GDP dissociation from wt Rac1, wt RhoC, wt RhoA, and wt Cdc42
was not facilitated by H2O2 (not shown), which
is consistent with the previous result. Similarly, H2O2 did not affect the Vav2 DPC
or Dbs DH/PH-mediated GDP dissociation from these redox-sensitive
wt Rho proteins (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest
that the GDP dissociation from these redox-sensitive Rho proteins
as well as the catalytic function of Vav2 DPC and Dbs DH/PH on these
redox-sensitive Rho proteins are insensitive to H2O2.

Discussion
This study shows that
an oxidant, O2•–, inhibits the
catalytic action of Cdc25—the catalytic core
domain of RasGEFs—on wt Ras. Although not shown for clarity
of presentation, •NO2 can be used to
mimic this inhibitory effect of O2•– on the catalytic action of Cdc25 with wt Ras and its cysteine mutants.
This function of O2•– or •NO2 is an intriguing addition to the previously
known role of oxidants in regulating wt Ras activity., Because the use of Ras C51S as the substrate of Cdc25 nullified
the oxidant-mediated inhibition of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on
wt Ras, the apparent mechanism of this inhibitory effect lies in the
Ras Cys51-targeting action of the oxidant. This action
appears to cause wt Ras insensitivity to the Cdc25 of RasGEFs.

Unlike with O2•– and •NO2, H2O2 did not inhibit the catalytic
action of Cdc25 on wt Ras. Taking into account that Ras Cys51 is a target site of the oxidant, this is consistent with the chemistry
in which the side chain of Ras Cys51 that contains the
sulfur atom does not react with H2O2 but does
react with O2•– or •NO2. However, this result does not necessarily eliminate
the role of H2O2 as a redox agent that modulates
wt Ras activity with RasGEFs in cells. This is because H2O2 in cells can be converted into other oxidants such
as a hydroxyl radical and a hydroxyl anion through the transition
metal-mediated Fenton reaction. These
free radicals from the Fenton reaction also are known to react with
sulfur. Therefore, H2O2—through its derivation products but not in its original
form—can function as an oxidant that can inhibit the catalytic
action of Cdc25 on wt Ras.

Because Cdc25 is the catalytic core
domain of many RasGEFs, including
SOS, RasGRF, and RasGRP, the observed desensitization of wt Ras to
Cdc25 by an oxidant represents the fundamental trait of the oxidant-dependent
regulation of wt Ras activity associated with these RasGEFs. However,
it is unclear if the oxidant has other effects on the catalytic action
of Cdc25 on wt Ras through unexamined noncatalytic RasGEF domains.
For example, it is uncertain whether the oxidant affects the function
of the noncatalytic domain(s) of RasGEFs (e.g., SOS), such as the
DH and PH domains. This study shows that, as a RhoGEF catalysis, the
function of the DH domain in combination with the PH domain is unaffected
by the oxidant (see the discussion below). However, this result does
not necessarily indicate that an oxidant has no effect on the regulatory
role of these noncatalytic domains in RasGEFs. The roles of these
noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs in the current model are linked to
the membrane anchorage of RasGEFs that is accompanied by RasGEF activation. Nevertheless, in assessing this current model,
the apparent uncertainties about the oxidant-dependent regulation
of the activity of RasGEFs via these noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs
is not enough to overshadow the significance of the finding of the
oxidant-mediated inhibition of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt
Ras. This is because of the expected conservation of this inhibition
feature regardless of any potential effects of the oxidant on these
noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs. For example, if the oxidant does
not perturb the functions of the noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs,
the oxidant will continue to inhibit the catalytic action of Cdc25
on wt Ras. If the oxidant serves as a negative heterotropic effector
by perturbing the membrane-anchorage functions of the noncatalytic
domains of RasGEFs, RasGEFs cannot be recruited for the plasma membrane
and activated. In this case, the oxidant inhibits the RasGEF activation
before inhibition of RasGEFs’ catalytic function. Therefore,
the oxidant will continue to inhibit the catalytic action of Cdc25
on wt Ras. Finally, even if the oxidant serves as a positive heterotropic
effector by enhancing functions of the noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs
so as to enhance RasGEF membrane binding and RasGEF activation, the
oxidant ultimately counteracts the RasGEF activation by inhibiting
the catalytic action of RasGEFs on wt Ras. Therefore, RasGEFs will
remain in an inactive state. In summary, regardless of any instances
of the action of the oxidant on the noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs,
no alteration would occur in the inhibitory effect of the oxidant
on the catalytic action of RasGEFs. Therefore, although the roles
of the oxidant in these noncatalytic domains of RasGEFs are yet to
be investigated, the observed desensitization of wt Ras to Cdc25 by
an oxidant is sufficient for it to be considered a factor in regulating
the wt Ras activity associated with these RasGEFs, thereby controlling
the Ras-dependent cell signaling cascades.

Implication of the Oxidant-Mediated
Inhibition of the RasGEF
Actions on wt Ras
Although the oxidant can directly activate
wt Ras via an enhancement of wt Ras GDP dissociation,, the oxidant also can indirectly inhibit the RasGEF-mediated wt Ras
activation through desensitization of wt Ras to the catalytic core
domain Cdc25 of RasGEFs (this study). This redox regulation of wt
Ras activity is more complicated than previously thought, but the result of this complexity in terms of
wt Ras GDP dissociation is rather straightforward: The RasGEF-mediated
enhancement of the GDP dissociation from wt Ras will only occur in
the presence of RasGEFs when the oxidant is absent. When both the
oxidant and RasGEFs are present, the oxidant desensitizes wt Ras to
the catalytic core domains of RasGEFs to perturb the catalytic action
of RasGEFs. At the same time, the oxidant retains its capability to
enhance the dissociation of wt Ras GDP, thereby only continuing the
oxidant-mediated enhancement of wt Ras GDP dissociation. These analyses
infer that, even if there are two unrelated signaling events such
as the nonredox and redox stimuli—for example, hormone- and
oxidative stress-dependent, respectively—toward wt Ras, the
Ras-dependent cellular signaling would not be overly upregulated.
This would prevent the overresponse of the Ras-dependent cellular
signaling cascades from multiple-signaling stimuli toward the wt Ras.
Failure of the mechanism of the oxidant-mediated inhibition of the
catalytic action on Ras (i.e., by Ras Cys51 mutation) triggers
the two simultaneous, but unrelated, signaling events that result
in overactivation of wt Ras. An overactivated wt Ras may possibly
alter various Ras-dependent cellular effects, including cell survival,
proliferation, and differentiation, in ways so as to produce certain
diseases such as cancer. This analysis
introduces the potential significance of the oxidant-mediated inhibition
of the function of RasGEFs on wt Ras as a regulatory outlet that prevents
overactivation of wt Ras as a cause of pathophysiological responses.
Also, the dominant feature of the redox-dependent response of wt Ras
compared with the nonredox-dependent response of wt Ras suggests that,
where wt Ras-dependent cellular signaling cascades are concerned,
the redox stimulus is somehow given more weight than the nonredox
stimulus. The cellular meaning of this dominancy in regulating the
wt Ras activity remains to be clarified.

The redox aspect of
the intrinsic catalytic action of RasGEFs on the chemically modified
form of wt Ras—such as wt Ras-SNO—is intriguing. The
reason for this interest is because the oxidant was unable to enhance
the GDP dissociation from wt Ras-SNO but nevertheless was able to
desensitize wt Ras-SNO to the catalytic core domains of RasGEFs, resulting
in inhibition of the RasGEF-mediated dissociation of GDP from wt Ras-SNO.
Consequently, when an oxidant and RasGEFs are present simultaneously,
the GDP dissociation from wt Ras-SNO cannot be accelerated. This notion
implies that the oxidant can downregulate Ras-SNO regardless of the
presence of RasGEFs. However, the appVmin value of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on C118S Ras
occurs at a significantly high concentration of O2•– (near 30 μM). This suggests that a significantly
high concentration of O2•– is
required for it to complete the inhibition of the RasGEF action on
wt Ras-SNO. Such a high concentration of O2•– occurs only in special cases, such as stimulated macrophages. Therefore, O2•– may not be completely inhibiting RasGEFs on wt Ras-SNO in the typical
oxidative stress conditions of cells. However, although it could depend
on cellular conditions, a complete inhibition of the RasGEF action
on wt Ras is not necessary to achieve the minimal level of the cellular
fraction of the GTP-bound form of wt Ras. Therefore, incomplete inhibition of RasGEFs by an oxidant that spurs
a certain minimal level of activity by RasGEFs is sufficient to generate
a basal level of cellular activity of wt Ras-SNO.

Although the
cellular conditions necessary to produce wt Ras-SNO
are yet to be clarified, we have found that a continuous treatment
of bladder carcinoma (T24) and fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cells with the
oxidant NO for at least 2 h produces wt Ras-SNO (unpublished results).
Maximization of the formation of wt Ras-SNO can also be achieved by
long-term treatment of NO (e.g., at least 1 day). Intriguingly, wt
Ras-SNO was formed in 15 min by treatment of NIH 3T3 and PC12 cells
with S-nitrosocysteine—another Ras S-nitrosation
agent. This result in conjunction with
our result suggests that, compared with the formation of wt Ras-SNO
by NO, the formation of wt Ras-SNO by S-nitrosocysteine
is likely effective in generating wt Ras-SNO. It is thus possible
that the degree of efficiency in the formation of wt Ras-SNO depends
on the type of oxidant. Nonetheless, when these findings are taken
together, it can be postulated that the continuous presence of the
oxidant not only results in the formation of wt Ras-SNO but also blocks
GDP dissociation from the newly formed wt Ras-SNO. The outcome of
this formation and blockage is production of a GDP-bound biologically
inactive wt Ras-SNO. This postulation explains the enigmatic result
of wt Ras inactivation by a long-term treatment of cells (&gt;1 day)
with NO.− Accordingly, although a definitive finding awaits
further studies, it is tempting to speculate that the extensive and
continuous presence of the oxidant leads to severe oxidative stress
that results in inactivation of wt Ras and shuts down wt Ras-mediated
cellular signaling events. Failure to prevent prolonged oxidant-mediated
wt Ras activation could result in continuation of the upregulation
of the Ras-dependent cellular signaling events. Such deregulation
could result in certain diseases such as cancer. Therefore, the pathophysiological
significance of the formation of wt Ras-SNO and its inactivation mechanism
may be to prevent continuous oxidative stress from overactivating
Ras. This notion is supported by the relatively higher fraction of
the GDP-bound form of wt Ras-SNO, compared with that of wt Ras, in
NIH 3T3 and PC12 cells.

Oxidant-mediated
wt Ras inactivation may not occur when oxidative
stress is not continuous. For example, a short burst of oxidative
stress activated wt Ras instead of inhibiting it. In fact, a short-term treatment of cells with NO did not
generate wt Ras-SNO (unpublished results). Therefore, a short and/or
a one-time treatment of cells with H2O2 or other
oxidants may be insufficient to generate an oxidized form of wt Ras
(e.g., wt Ras-SNO) but may be sufficient to activate wt Ras via the
redox-mediated wt Ras activation mechanism.

Kinetic Mechanism of the Oxidant-Mediated Inhibition of the
Catalytic Activity of RasGEFs on wt Ras
This study shows
that, among other Ras cysteines, the Ras Cys51 is involved
in the oxidant-mediated interference with the wt Ras binding interaction
with Cdc25. This interference results in desensitization of wt Ras
to Cdc25. Such desensitization apparently inhibits the catalytic action
of Cdc25 on wt Ras.

Figure  shows that
two mechanistic steps are among the essential features of the process
by which Cdc25 enhances the nucleotide exchange of wt Ras GTPase., The first of these is the binding of Cdc25 to the GDP-bound wt Ras
to produce the ternary wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25 complex. The
formation of the ternary complex disrupts the binding interaction
between wt Ras and GDP, resulting in release of the bound GDP to produce
the wt Ras Cdc25 binary complex. The second step is the binding of
the cellularly abundant GTP to the wt Ras complexed with Cdc25; this
binding expels the bound Cdc25 from wt Ras to produce GTP-bound wt
Ras. Given that an oxidant inhibits the catalytic action of Cdc25
on wt Ras that is an enhancement of the wt Ras-bound GDP, the oxidant
evidently targets the ternary complex (Figure ). Accordingly, the pattern of the oxidant-mediated inhibition of
the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras can be classified as apparent
uncompetitive. This apparent uncompetitive kinetic pattern suggests
that the reaction of the oxidant with the ternary complex produces
the radicalized wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25 ternary complex (wt
Ras*–GDP–Cdc25) through the kinetic step of KI. Formation of wt Ras*–GDP–Cdc25
dodges the k2 step—the key catalytic
step of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras (Figure ). This kinetic scheme also suggests that the more the oxidant
is proportionate to the production of the radicalized wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25
complex, but the lesser the oxidant is proportionate to the turnover
of the Cdc25-mediated wt Ras GDP dissociation via the k2 step. This relation defines the disproportionate feature
of the KI value over the k2 value. Notably, the appKI value (2.3 μM [KO2], Figure ) was determined by monitoring the value of the
C118S Ras GDP dissociation (the k2 value)
in the presence of the oxidant. Therefore, the appKI value that was determined essentially represents
the value of KI of the oxidant for wt
Ras–GDP–Cdc25 to produce wt Ras*–GDP–Cdc25.

Proposed
kinetic mechanism of the oxidant-mediated inhibition of
the RasGEF action on Ras. An apparent uncompetitive inhibition of
the oxidant for the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras is shown with
several kinetic constants. The binary wt Ras–GDP complex binds
Cdc25 to produce the ternary wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25 complex,
and this step couples with an equilibrium association constant K1. The step represented by the rate constant k2 that produces the Ras–Cdc25 binary
complex is the rate limiting step for the catalytic action of Cdc25
on wt Ras. The cellularly abundant GTP displaces the wt Ras bound
Cdc25 to produce the GTP-bound wt Ras. When the inhibitor—an
oxidant—exists, through the step of KI, the ternary wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25 complex reacts
with the oxidant to produce the radicalized ternary wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25
complex (ternary wt Ras*–GDP–Cdc25 complex). The buried
Ras Cys51 side chain in the cartoon figure of the binary
wt Ras–GDP complex (PDB 1AGP) is shown with a dotted arrow (left).
The solvent-exposed Ras Cys51 side chain in the cartoon
figure of the binary wt Ras–Cdc25 complex (PDB 1BKD) is indicated with
a dotted arrow (right). These figures were generated using The PyMOL
Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.6 Schrödinger, LLC.

Potential Role of Ras Cys51 in the Oxidant-Mediated
Inhibition of the Catalytic Activity of RasGEFs by the Perturbation
the wt Ras–Cdc25 Binding Interaction
Although the
pattern of the oxidant-mediated inhibition of the catalytic action
of Cdc25 on wt Ras can be defined as apparent uncompetitive, details
of the role of Cys51 in this inhibition are unclear. As
a target of the oxidant, the side chain of the Ras Cys51 in the ternary wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25 complex must be accessible
to solvents. This possibility cannot be inspected because the structure
of the ternary complex is unknown. However, the features of the available
crystal structures before and after the ternary wt Ras–GDP–Cdc25
complex (wt Ras–GDP complex) and (wt Ras–Cdc25 complex)
(Figure ), respectively, suggest that the
binding interaction of wt Ras with Cdc25 exposes the side chain of
the Ras Cys51 to solvents. Such binding interaction is
the key to the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras. Accordingly, it
can be postulated that the oxidant, via targeting Ras Cys51, interferes with the wt Ras Cdc25 binding interaction and consequently
restricts the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras. Furthermore, given
the similarity of the value of the KD of
the oxidant for the wt Ras–Cdc25 complex and that of the appKI of the oxidant for the ternary
complex, the perturbation of the wt Ras Cdc25 binding interaction
is likely the main factor that determines the oxidant-mediated inhibition
of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras.

Mechanically, the
oxidant-dependent protein–protein binding interaction can be
perturbed by either the state- or the process-based route. The mechanism
associated with the state-based route herein refers to an outcome
in which a chemical modification of the redox-sensitive cysteine and/or
its relevant residue results in the alteration of a protein structure.
This protein structural change perturbs its protein binding interaction
with its counterpart. The mechanism of the process-based route within
this article denotes that the reaction process between the oxidant
and the redox-sensitive cysteine associated with its relevant residue(s)
perturbs the protein binding interaction with its counterpart. In
this mechanism, the chemical modification of the redox-sensitive cysteine
and/or its relevant residue(s) occurs at the end of the process of
the perturbation of the binding interactions between the protein and
its counterpart. As for the redox regulation of wt Ras, the state-based
mechanism was initially postulated for the oxidant-mediated enhancement
of the wt Ras GDP dissociation coupled with the Ras-SNO formation.
Similarly, the process-based mechanism was postulated as an alternative
of the state-based mechanism to explain the oxidant-mediated enhancement
of the wt Ras and wt Rho GDP dissociation without formation of the
wt Ras-SNO. Nonetheless, based upon the
currently available data, it is difficult to predict which of these
routes best describes the mechanism of the oxidant-mediated inhibition
of the catalytic action of Cdc25 on wt Ras.

The chemical modification
and/or oxidation state of the Ras Cys51 side chain is of
interest because it could directly support
the involvement of Ras Cys51 with an oxidant in the perturbation
of the wt Ras–Cdc25 binding interaction. However, our mass
spectrometric analyses, which used both electrospray ionization and
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight approaches,
did not detect any of the chemical modification/oxidation of the Ras
Cys51 side chain under our experimental conditions. Nevertheless,
this failure does not disprove the involvement of Ras Cys51 in the oxidant-mediated perturbation of the wt Ras–Cdc25
binding interaction. There is a precedent for this situation in which,
although Ras Cys118 is typically a target of an oxidant
to enhance the wt Ras GDP dissociation (which means Ras Cys118 is certainly involved in the oxidant-mediated enhancement of the
wt Ras GDP dissociation), Ras Cys118 was not chemically
modified/oxidized by the oxidant after the completion of the oxidant-mediated
wt Ras GNE. It also is noteworthy that
the lack of chemical modification/oxidation of the Ras Cys51 side chain does not necessarily indicate that any of these potential
mechanisms fit the case of the oxidant-mediated perturbation of the
wt Ras–Cdc25 binding interaction. To the contrary, the potential
chemical modification/oxidation of the Ras Cys51 side chain
does not support any of these mechanisms. This is because the state
of the features of the chemical modification/oxidation of the Ras
Cys51 side chain does not necessarily couple with the structural
change in wt Ras and/or Cdc25 nor does it necessarily couple with
the mechanistic perturbation of the binding interaction between wt
Ras and Cdc25. This argument is again based upon the case of the oxidant-mediated
enhancement of the wt Ras GDP dissociation in which the oxidant-mediated
Ras chemical modification—Ras-SNO formation—couples
with neither the Ras structural change nor with the mechanistic perturbation
of the binding interaction between wt Ras and a nucleotide.

Redox Regulation of wt Rho GTPases with RhoGEFs
Studies
show that the GDP binding interactions of certain wt Rho GTPases,
including wt Rac1 as well as wt RhoC, wt RhoA, and wt Cdc42, are redox
sensitive., This study shows that, in contrast to the
effect of O2•– or •NO2 on Cdc25 with wt Ras, O2•– or •NO2 is unable to inhibit the catalytic
action of Vav2 DPC on wt Rac1. Vav2 DPC is the wt Rac-specific RhoGEF
that possesses a catalytic domain as well as the regulatory domains
of Vav. Hence, regulation of the catalytic activity of Vav associated
with its regulatory domains is likely to be insensitive to O2•– and •NO2.

This study also shows that neither O2•– nor •NO2 inhibits the catalytic action
of Dbs DH/PH on wt RhoC or wt RhoA. Dbs DH/PH is the catalytic domain
of Dbs that is a wt RhoA- and wt RhoC-specific RhoGEF. Hence, although
it is clear that the catalytic function of Dbs is unaffected by O2•– or •NO2, the potential redox role of other known or unknown regulatory domains
of Dbs is of interest because the Dbs regulatory domain(s) can influence
the catalytic activity of Dbs. A previous study showed that using
oxidant NO in the long term treatment of SUM and wt RhoC-overexpressed
primary human mammary epithelial cells did not block the loading of
a nucleotide analog, 6-thioguanine nucleotide, to wt RhoC. Notably, these SUM cells treated with NO were
exposed to O2, and thus, it
can be safely assumed that at least some portion of the treated NO
reacts with O2 to produce •NO2 and higher oxides. Accordingly, the
generation of the 6-thioguanine nucleotide-bound wt RhoC in these
cells likely was solely because the catalytic action of Dbs was uninhibited
despite the presence of the oxidant •NO2. Taking into account that the Dbs expressed constitutively in these
cells is a full construct that contains catalytic and regulatory domains,
the results and analysis together suggest that the catalytic function
of Dbs was not inhibited by an oxidant despite the presence of the
Dbs regulatory domains. Hence, it can be postulated that, as with
Vav, an oxidant such as O2•– or •NO2 does not influence the catalytic function
of Dbs in association with its regulatory domains.
