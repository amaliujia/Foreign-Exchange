Model peptides have proven to
be useful for studying protein–lipid interactions, which in
turn are important for the regulation of biological function. Model
systems offer particular advantages for establishing general principles
because specific changes in peptide sequence and structure can be
made, and the direct effects on interaction with a surrounding lipid
membrane can be analyzed. Several membrane proteins, including gramicidin
channels, reveal the preferred location of tryptophan residues at
the lipid–water interface.− For model peptide design,
a core leucine–alanine sequence will enhance sensitivity of the peptide to membrane thickness because
of hydrophobic mismatch. Then, by altering the identities or positions
of aromatic anchors that flank the core sequence, the effects of these
placements on the orientations and dynamics of transmembrane helices
can be investigated and inferences for membrane proteins can be deduced.

The early model WALP peptides (acetyl-GWWA(LA)nLWWA-[ethanol]amide), incorporating multiple Trp (W) anchors
and the helical, hydrophobic repeating Leu–Ala core sequence,
were important for helping to establish principles for the interfacial
partitioning of Trp residues and the modulation of lipid phase behavior. Later, the four Trp residues were mutated to
other aromatic or charged residues (Tyr, Phe, Lys, Arg, or His) to
monitor the importance of the chemical and physical properties., The WALP family peptides adopt specific preferred tilted transmembrane
orientations in lipid bilayer membranes,, but, in addition
to cone precession about the membrane normal, they also experience excessive dynamic averaging of solid-state
NMR observables,− caused by the presence of the four Trp residues. Importantly, the extent of dynamic averaging can be greatly
reduced by decreasing the number of aromatic residues, as in GWALP23
(acetyl-GGALW(LA)6LWLAGA-[ethanol]amide), which possesses only two Trp residues and still maintains
a preferred and well-defined tilted orientation,, with low dynamic averaging. The tryptophans
in GWALP23 thereby flank a hydrophobic Leu–Ala core of the
same length as that of WALP19., With fewer aromatic
residues, it becomes easier to assess the roles of each of them. The
results to date suggest that four Trp anchors are so dominating, and
possibly competing, that they induce
significant peptide dynamics, mainly because of rotational “slippage”
about the helix axis.,

The favorable properties
of GWALP23 have enabled this peptide to
be employed as a highly suitable parent host framework for examining
the influence of specific charged guest residues within the core hydrophobic
sequence., It has furthermore been possible to examine
the titration behavior of specific residues and the influence of ionization
state upon helix orientation. Within
the GWALP23 context, questions arose about the effects of changing
the identity, number, and position of the aromatic residues. A peptide
having a single Trp → Tyr replacement (Y5GWALP23)
exhibits similar transmembrane orientation and dynamics as those of
GWALP23, in three different lipids, such
that the substitution of Tyr for Trp causes no fundamental change
in the lipid–peptide interactions. However, when two Tyr residues
are introduced to produce Y4,5GWALP23, the extent of dynamic
averaging increases dramatically, reminiscent
of the earlier WALP peptides.

With the Trp- and Tyr-containing
members of the GWALP23 family
as a backdrop, we have examined the influence of phenylalanine by
altering the Tyr-containing models so as to have non-hydrogen-bonding
Phe residues in F5GW19ALP23 and F4,5GW19ALP23 (acetyl-GGAF4F5(LA)6LW19LAGA-[ethanol]amide). We furthermore examined
whether the dynamic behavior shown by Y4,5GW19ALP23 could be caused by Y4 alone, as opposed to the Y4,5 combination.
Placing a Tyr residue at position 4 also provided a way of determining
the effects of moving a single aromatic residue one position (100°)
around the α helix by comparison with Y5GW19ALP23. A similar radial comparison between aromatic ring positions
was made by moving Trp19 to position 18 to give GW5,18ALP23.

Materials
and Methods
Peptides F5GWALP23, F4,5GWALP23, Y4GWALP23, and W18GWALP23 (Table ) were synthesized on a model 433A synthesizer from
Applied Biosystems
by Life Technologies (Foster City, CA) using solid-phase methods,
as described previously. Typically, two
deuterated alanines of differing isotope abundances were incorporated
into each synthesized peptide. Peptides were purified as described, using an octyl silica column (Zorbax Rx-C8, 9.4 × 250 mm, 5
μm particle size; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and
a gradient of 97–100% methanol (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)
over 28 min. Final peptide purity (&gt;97%) was confirmed by reversed-phase
HPLC, and peptide identity, by mass spectrometry (Figure S1 of the ).

Solid-state 2H NMR experiments,
using mechanically aligned
samples, were performed using methods that have been described previously. Mechanically aligned samples (1:60, peptide/lipid;
45% hydration, w/w) were prepared using DOPC, DMPC, or DLPC lipid
from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and deuterium-depleted water
from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Bilayer alignment
within each sample was confirmed using 31P NMR at 50 °C
on a Bruker (Billerica, MA) Avance 300 spectrometer. Deuterium NMR
spectra were recorded at 50 °C using both β = 0° (bilayer
normal parallel to magnetic field) and β = 90° macroscopic
sample orientations on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer utilizing
a quadrupolar echo pulse sequence with
90 ms recycle delay, 3.2 μs pulse length, and 115 μs echo
delay. Between 0.6 and 1.5 million scans were accumulated during each 2H NMR experiment. An exponential weighting function with 100
Hz line broadening was applied prior to Fourier transformation.

Helix orientations were analyzed by means of a semistatic “GALA”
method based on three adjustable parameters: the average tilt τo of the helix axis, the average azimuthal rotation ρo about the helix axis, and a principal order parameter Szz, as described., An additional
three-parameter modified Gaussian method is available, based on τo, ρo, a distribution width σρ,
and a fixed στ. We also employed
this modified Gaussian method, but στ was fixed at either
15° (DLPC) or 9° (DOPC; see ) instead of the previously assumed value of 0° for στ.
For the analysis of helix rotation, we analyzed some pairwise residue
separation distances using a recently described procedure. Distances were compared to hydrophobic thicknesses
of 20.9 Å for DLPC and 27.2 Å
for DOPC, which are based on the location DC of the Gibbs dividing surface for the hydrocarbon
region of the bilayer.

Results
The designed peptides (Table  and Figure ) were successfully synthesized and purified, as
confirmed by analytical HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Figure
S1 of the ). The
repeating Leu–Ala sequence at the core of GWALP peptides favors
folding into α-helical secondary structure within the hydrophobic
region of the lipid bilayer. Indeed, the CD spectra for the new variants
of GWALP23 (Figure ) show a minimum near 208
nm and a broad shoulder near 222 nm, indicating that the secondary
structure is indeed α-helical. The 31P NMR spectra
for oriented samples of each peptide–lipid combination furthermore
confirmed the presence of oriented lipid bilayers within samples that
were aligned with the bilayer normal either parallel (β = 0°)
or perpendicular (β = 90°) to the applied magnetic field.
The spectra exhibit characteristic 31P resonances located
close to −14.5 ppm for the β = 90° orientation and
near +29 ppm when β = 0° (Figure S2 of the ).

Solid-state 2H NMR
spectra from oriented samples of
peptide and lipid enable the relative orientations and dynamic behavior
of the folded peptide helices to be determined in lipid bilayer membranes.
The aromatic residues on each end of the hydrophobic (LA)n core of GWALP peptides help to position the peptide
termini at the respective membrane–water interfaces, at best
in orientations that minimize hydrophobic mismatch between the lipid
thickness and the peptide length. Deuterium-labeled (2H)
alanine residues at various positions in the core Leu–Ala sequence
of each peptide then allow characterization of the behavior of the
peptides in aligned bilayers by means of solid-state 2H
NMR spectroscopy. The 2H quadrupolar splitting magnitudes
|Δνq| from the alanine CD3 (or C-D)
groups serve to define a preferred tilted, dynamically averaged, orientation
of the entire helix with respect to the bilayer normal in an applied
magnetic field.,

On the basis of the solid-state 2H NMR spectra (Figures
S3–S5 of the ), we observed a wide range of quadrupolar splittings for F5 GWALP23, from 1 to 22 kHz in DLPC and 1–18 kHz in DOPC (Table ), suggesting that the peptide helix tilts substantially
in the bilayer membranes. (If the helix were not tilted, then all
of the labeled alanines would give the same signal, namely, the same
quadrupolar splitting, Δνq.) The wide ranges
of 21 and 17 kHz are consistent with those seen previously for the
W5 and Y5 analogues of GWALP23, suggesting similar global helix dynamics
regardless of whether the aromatic residue is capable (W5 and Y5)
or not (F5) of hydrogen bonding. Indeed, the ranges of Δνq values observed when W5 is present are 23 and 14 kHz in DLPC
and DOPC, respectively. The corresponding ranges when Y5 is present
are 21 and 13 kHz. These large and similar ranges of Δνq in all three of the X5GWALP23 peptides, where
X is aromatic, suggest that all of these GWALP23 analogues are tilted
to similar extents, and exhibit similar dynamics, in the lipid bilayer
membranes.

at β = 0° and twice the magnitude observed for a β

recorded. The labeled alanines are identified, and the positions of
the N-flanking aromatic amino acids are indicated as F5, F4,5, and Y4. The C-flanking W19 is present in all samples except for W5W18.

By using an α-helical
geometry and a principal order parameter Szz to describe the helix motions, the sets of 2H-alanine
quadrupolar splittings can be analyzed by a method
known as “geometric analysis of labeled alanines” (GALA). The method finds the lowest RMSD values based
on the helix tilt (τ), azimuthal rotation (ρ), and Szz as variables. Notably, the resulting tilt
values for F5GWALP23 (about 7 and 21° in DOPC and
DLPC, respectively) are nearly identical to those found previously for the W5 and Y5 peptides (Table ). In the shorter DLPC lipids, the average tilt of the W19
peptides with a single N-flanking aromatic residue at position five
is 21°, whereas in the longer DOPC lipids, the average tilt is
6°. Comparison of these τ values for DLPC and DOPC lipids
suggests that each of the X5GWALP23 peptide responds to
hydrophobic mismatch by tilting more in the thinner bilayers.

It
was surprising (see ) to observe
that the double-Phe derivative, F4,5GWALP23, with adjacent
aromatic phenyl rings at positions 4 and 5, displays a wider range
of 2H quadrupolar splittings than does F5GWALP23
itself. These results stand in stark contrast to the earlier comparison
between Y4,5GWALP23 and Y5GWALP23. In the shortest lipid, DLPC, the range of Δνq for alanines in F4,5GWALP23 is about 24 kHz, from
1.8 to 25.7 kHz. In DOPC, the values cover a range of about 17 kHz,
from 1.9 to 18.6 kHz (Table ). These differences
suggest that F4,5GWALP23 may be tilted to greater extent
or may undergo less dynamic averaging than the single-anchored X5GWALP23 peptides. It is striking that the results for F4,5GWALP23 differ greatly from the previous characterization
of Y4,5GWALP23. The larger
quadrupolar splittings that are observed in 2H NMR spectra
for the F4,5 peptide are greatly reduced in the spectra for Y4,5 (Figure ). The ranges of the quadrupolar splitting magnitudes
from alanines in Y4,5GWALP23 therefore span only 11 and
9 kHz in DLPC and DOPC, respectively (Table ). By changing the identity of the aromatic anchors at positions
4 and 5 from Tyr to Phe (Y to F), thereby removing the hydrogen-bonding
ability of the aromatic ring, the net effect is to double the kilohertz
range that is spanned by the alanine quadrupolar splittings, a dramatic
change! Furthermore, when comparing the change in Δνq range from DLPC to DOPC, one would expect a significant decrease
due to less tilting necessary in the longer lipid. For F4,5GWALP23, the range indeed narrows from 24 to 17 kHz from DLPC to
DOPC, but for Y4,5GWALP23, the range hardly changes. These
results suggest that the Tyr (Y) anchors at positions 4 and 5 allow
far less response to bilayer thickness than do the Phe (F) anchors,
probably because the extent of dynamic averaging is large in both
lipids when Y4 and Y5 are present together.

Ala-15 is 100% deuterated and Ala-11 is 50% deuterated. β =
90° sample orientation; 50 °C.

The results of tilt analysis for F4,5GWALP23 also
are
strikingly different from the previous results for Y4,5GWALP23. The tilt value for F4,5GWALP23 in DLPC (∼21°) is much larger than the “apparent”
tilt of the Y4,5 analogue (∼5°) (Table ). The actual tilt of Y4,5GWALP23 in DLPC is nevertheless
obscured by the extensive dynamics of this peptide. Remarkably, F4,5GWALP23 does not suffer from
the high dynamics and gives quadrupolar wave fits for tilt and azimuthal
rotation similar to those for F5GWALP23 in DLPC and DOPC
(Figure ). In DLPC, the wave amplitude actually
is larger for F4,5GWALP23 than for F5GWALP23
(Figure A), suggesting somewhat lower dynamic
averaging for F4,5GWALP23, and the wave amplitudes for
both F4,5GWALP23 and F5GWALP23 are notably very
much larger than that for Y4,5GWALP23 in DLPC. In DOPC, these three peptides have rather similar
small tilt angles (Figure B and Table ), yet the dynamic averaging remains much larger
for Y4,5GWALP23 (see ).

and F4,5GWALP23 (red, circles) in (A) DLPC and (B) DOPC.

For the case of moving the tyrosine
residue from position 5 to
position 4 in the sequence, the helix tilt and dynamics remain unchanged,
yet a phase change is seen in the quadrupolar wave plot (Figure ), indicating a change in the helix azimuthal rotation
(ρo) or direction of the tilt. Semistatic GALA analysis
of Y4GWALP23 indicates that the rotation of the peptide
changes by about 31° in DLPC and 46° in DOPC (Table ) when Y5 is moved radially by 100° to position
4. A top view or helical wheel illustrates these differences in the
direction of tilt for Y4GWALP23 and Y5GWALP23
(Figure B). Importantly, the extensive dynamics
observed for double-Tyr derivative Y4,5GWALP23 are not
caused by either Y4 or Y5 alone, but rather by the presence of the
two tyrosines together.

Y4GWALP23 (red circle) and Y5GWALP23 (blue circle)
in DOPC, offset by ∼50°. The labels Y4 and
Y5 represent the respective radial locations of the tyrosines,
which differ by 100° on the helical wheel.

Because of the change in azimuthal rotation that accompanies
the
moving of Y5 to Y4, we decided to investigate the consequence of moving
W19 to position 18 in GWALP23. The results (Figure ) indicate a larger rotational shift of almost 100° for
the peptide helix in DLPC when W19 in GWALP23 is moved by 100°
to W18. This large shift suggests a dominant role for W19 in determining
the azimuthal rotation preference of GWALP23 in lipid bilayer membranes.
Yet, a similar comparison between GWALP23 and W18GWALP23
in DOPC brings a surprise (Table ). Namely,
the preferred azimuthal rotation of the W18GWALP23 helix
seems to depend upon the lipid environment. Within the realm of transmembrane
peptides that exhibit low dynamic averaging, this result for W18GWALP23 stands in contrast to the essentially constant rotational
preferences of other GWALP23 family peptides in bilayers of differing
thickness. Namely, for the transmembrane
helices of GWALP23, R2,22GWALP23, and K2,22GWALP23, as well as R14GWALP23,, Y5GWALP23, Y19GWALP23, Y4GWALP23, F5GWALP23, and F4,5GWALP23 (this work), the most
probable azimuthal rotation ρo about the helix axis
does not vary appreciably when each particular helix is moved from
DLPC to DMPC or DOPC. For cases of excess dynamics, namely, W2,22GWALP23 and Y4,5GWALP23, which also incorporate extra
aromatic residues, σρ is large and ρo is not well defined from lipid to lipid. In this respect,
W18GWALP23 stands alone with low dynamic averaging and
yet has a value of ρo that changes by about 135°
from DLPC to DOPC (Table ). Even if one considers
a Gaussian analysis (see ), the
value of ρo still varies widely from DLPC to DOPC.
We therefore sought to consider possible reasons for this lipid-dependent
variation in helix azimuthal rotation.

in DLPC, offset by ∼100°. The labels W18 and
W19 represent the respective radial locations of the tryptophans,
which differ by 100° on the helical wheel.

Recently, a method was presented
for
correlating helix rotational preference with flanking residue positions
on a tilted transmembrane helix. We have applied this method to W18GWALP23 (Figure ) as well as to the
parent GWALP23 helix (Figure ). These peptides
are sequence isomers that differ only with respect a substitution
of W18L19 in place of L18W19; yet, their rotational preferences are remarkably different. A flanking
residue analysis suggests that the rotation of W18GWALP23
is governed not by the W18-to-W5 distance (along the bilayer normal)
but perhaps by the L20-to-L4 distance (Figure ). Indeed, the tilted W18GWALP23 helix rotates about its
axis to give approximately the minimum L20-to-L4 distance in DLPC
(Figure A) and approximately the maximum L20-to-L4
distance in DOPC (Figure B). Notably, the
tilt angle for W18GWALP23 appears to be essentially the
same in DOPC as in DLPC (Table , Figure ), with the main adaption seeming to involve the
helix rotation. We will revisit these issues using a modified Gaussian
analysis (see ).

and hydrophobic (L20–L4) residue

tilted helix axis (A) when τo = 18° in DLPC
or (B) when τo = 17° in DOPC. The preferred
ρo values are shown by the arrows. The respective
bilayer thicknesses are indicated by the dashed segments.

Aromatic residue Cβ separation distance

the bilayer normal and W19 Cβ distance from bilayer

axis (A) when τo = 23° in DLPC or (B) when τo = 9° in DOPC. The preferred ρo values
are shown by the arrows. The respective bilayer thicknesses are indicated
by the dashed segments.

However, the rotation of GWALP23 (Figure ) seems not to correlate with either the W19-to-W5 distance
or the
L20-to-L4 distance. Indeed, we surmise that W19 itself may play a
special role. Being near the C-terminal, the indole side chain of
W19 must adopt non-standard torsion angles, in order to aim its NH bond toward the aqueous solution. Furthermore,
the helix properties are more sensitive to substitution of W19 by
Tyr than to substitution of W5 by Tyr, again suggesting a special role for the W19 indole. Within this
context, the tilted GWALP23 helix in DLPC is rotated so as to provide
an (perhaps fortuitous) exact match between the W19 Cβ distance from the bilayer center and half of the DLPC bilayer’s
hydrophobic thickness (Figure A). In the thicker
DOPC, the GWALP23 helix is less tilted such that the W19 Cβ position, with respect to the bilayer center, varies less steeply
with rotation (Figure B). There is a detectable,
yet minor, change in ρo, so as to move the W19 side
chain outward, but only slightly, with the main adaption being the
smaller helix tilt in the thicker lipid bilayer. In contrast, W18GWALP23 adapts to the changing lipid environment more by
changing its helix rotation than by changing its tilt (Figure ).

Discussion
Recent reports have compared
the influence of Tyr versus Trp in
the N-flanking position 5 and the C-flanking
position 19 () in membrane-spanning GWALP23
peptides. The main findings were that either Tyr or Trp at each location
will support a similar tilted transmembrane helix orientation, with
only about a 10 relative azimuthal rotation about the helix axis when
Tyr is substituted for Trp. Furthermore, the extent of dynamic averaging
of solid-state NMR observables remains low as long as only one interfacial
aromatic residue is present at each end of the membrane-spanning GWALP23
helix (with no extra aromatic residues potentially competing for lipid
headgroup interactions).

In the present work, we compare the
results for Trp/Tyr with the
consequences of Phe substitutions at positions 4 and 5 in GWALP23.
Additionally, we examine the consequences of moving a single aromatic
side chain, either Y5 or W19, 100° around the helix axis by interchanging
either Y5 and L4 or W19 and L18. Key findings are (a) an unexpectedly
low extent of dynamic averaging for F4,5GWALP23 and (b)
a preference of azimuthal rotation of W18GWALP23 that depends
upon the identity (thickness) of the host lipid bilayer membrane.
We will discuss first the results with the tyrosine-to-phenylalanine
substitutions. Because of the differences in dynamics, we will also
present the outcomes for a modified Gaussian treatment of the helix
rotational dynamic averaging. Then, we will discuss the changes in
rotational preference when aromatic and leucine residue locations
are switched on the N-flanking side or the C-flanking side of the
core helix.

Changes Involving Y5 → F5 or Y4,Y5 → F4,F5
A significant question concerns the hydrogen-bonding property of
the OH group on the Y5 ring, which could interact favorably, albeit
transiently (under conditions of dynamic hydrogen-bond exchange),
with lipid heads groups and interfacial water molecules. The potential
for hydrogen bonding is nevertheless absent when the F5 phenyl ring
is substituted for Y5. With F5GWALP23, we find that hydrogen
bonding by the N-flanking aromatic ring is not necessarily needed
to define a preferred, stable transmembrane orientation, with limited
dynamic averaging, for the core (LA)6L transmembrane helix.
In this context, the indole ring of W19 seems to have special importance
for defining the orientation and low dynamics (see below) and should
not be overlooked or underestimated. Notably, F5GWALP23
exhibits a similar transmembrane orientation as that of Y5GWALP23 and W5GWALP23 (Figure  and Table ), with low dynamic averaging.
Furthermore, F5GWALP23, as well as its Y5 and W5 cousins,
adapts to changes in the lipid bilayer thickness mainly by changing
its tilt (Figure  and Table ), with little change of the helix azimuthal rotation. The
slightly smaller amplitude of the quadrupolar wave for F5GWALP23 in DLPC (Figure ) nevertheless suggests
increased dynamic averaging, which indeed is borne out by the lower
estimate of 0.58 for Szz for F5GWALP23 in DLPC (Table ). This order parameter
is notably low compared to those observed for gramicidin A and Y5GWALP23 or GWALP23 itself (Table ). Moreover, we note the uniformly lower estimates
for Szz from the semistatic GALA analysis
of each peptide helix in DLPC compared to DOPC (Table ).

The change from Y4,5GWALP23 to F4,5GWALP23 brings big changes to the properties of the transmembrane
helix, mainly to reduce the very extensive dynamic averaging that
occurs when Y4 and Y5 are present together. It has been noted that
Y4,5GWALP23 exhibits dramatically more dynamic averaging
than is the case when only one tyrosine is present in Y5GWALP23. What happens when the hydrogen-bonding
ability is removed from the Y4 and Y5 aromatic rings? Remarkably,
the dynamic averaging is seen to diminish when F4 and F5 are present
(compare Figure 4 to Figure 6B in ref ()). We surmise that the phenyl rings of F4 and
F5 are favorably placed if they are just “in the neighborhood”
of the interfacial region, without need of any specific interactions
with the lipid head groups. Phenol rings Y4 and Y5, on the other hand,
may compete, perhaps alternately, for direct hydrogen-bonding interactions
with lipid head groups. Such competition, if not able to optimize
simultaneously a Y4 interaction and a Y5 interaction, could lead to
increased helix rotational dynamics of the type suggested previously., Importantly, neither Y4 nor Y5 alone causes the extensive dynamic
averaging (see below); rather, it is the pair of tyrosines together
that leads to the high level of dynamics, as has been noted also for
pairs of tryptophans.

Modified Gaussian
Treatment of the Dynamics
We sought
to compare a semistatic treatment with a modified Gaussian treatment
of the dynamic properties of each of the transmembrane peptides. The
semistatic GALA treatment, employs three adjustable
parameters: tilt, τo, and azimuthal rotation, ρo, to describe helix orientation, together with a principal
order parameter, Szz, to provide a highly
abbreviated estimate of overall dynamics. A Gaussian treatment offers
advantages of describing estimates for helix “wobble”
στ and rotational “slippage”
σρ, but it does so at the expense of requiring
four adjustable parameters instead of three. As an alternative, a modified Gaussian treatment has been suggested, in which στ is held constant
and dynamic differences are embodied in an adjustable σρ. We have employed this modified procedure but differing in that we set στ to a small finite value instead of to zero while maintaining Szz of 0.88 as an estimate of internal motion
of the peptide.

Notably, the results
of such a modified Gaussian analysis (Table ) agree substantially with the conclusions from a semistatic GALA
analysis (Table ). Both methods indicate that
each peptide (except possibly W18GWALP23; see below) adapts
from DOPC to DLPC by increasing its tilt. The methods in all cases
give the same preferred values of ρo in each lipid
and are in agreement concerning the small variations when the identity
of aromatic residue 5 is changed. Additionally, the same trends for
in ρo are seen with either method when a peptide
helix is moved from DOPC to DLPC. Generally, the change of lipid involves
only a small Δρo, excepting the case of W18GWALP23 (see below) and the highly dynamic Y4,5GWALP23, noted previously.

Analysis followed Strandberg et
al., but στ was assigned
a finite value instead of 0° (see ). Except as noted, στ was set to 15° in DLPC or
9° in DOPC.

The value
of στ was
20° because no satisfactory solution was found when στ
= 15°.

The value of
σρ remains
&gt; 90° even if στ is set to 20°.

The value of στ was
13° because no satisfactory solution was found when στ
= 9°.

The value of
σρ is perhaps
artificially low because of the choice of στ. Because
of the limited data set, further solutions were not explored.

The respective outcomes for fitting
the dynamics also are similar.
The semistatic analysis (Table ) leads to
estimates for Szz that are higher in DOPC
than in DLPC, seemingly because the relatively smaller tilt angles
in DOPC do not demand a downgrade of Szz during the fitting process. For the modified Gaussian analysis,
we set στ to 15° in DLPC (where τo is larger) and to 9° in DOPC (where τo is smaller). (When presented with a binary choice of either 9 or
15°, the analytical software selected 15° for each peptide
in DLPC but 9° for each peptide in DOPC; the values subsequently
were fixed.) With these constraints, the resulting fitted values for
σρ are similar between DLPC and DOPC (Table ), with somewhat larger values of σρ emerging for the fits in DOPC (perhaps reflecting the somewhat smaller
choice for στ). For the highly dynamic Y4,5GWALP23, σρ is seen to be very large
in both DLPC and DOPC, thereby confirming earlier conclusions based
on semistatic analysis. With a caveat
that the helix behavior should be examined in more than one lipid,
similar conclusions about the extent of dynamic averaging (whether
limited, moderate, or high) for each transmembrane helix emerge from
the semistatic GALA and modified Gaussian analyses. It is useful and
productive to apply and compare both methods.

Changes in Rotational Preference
when Y5 Is Moved or W18 Is
Moved
We observed sizable changes in the preference for helix
azimuthal rotation when a key aromatic ring, the side chain of either
residue 5 or residue 19, has been moved by 100° around the helix
axis (Tables  and ). In this regard, the Trp residue, W19, seems once again to have
a special importance, as the changes to the rotational preference
are larger and lipid-dependent when this tryptophan is moved.

When Y4 is moved to Y5, the preferred ρo changes
by about 30–35° in DLPC and by about 40–45°
in DOPC. Conspicuously, the deduced values of Δρo are similar between the semistatic and modified Gaussian methods
of analysis (Tables  and ). The rotational change furthermore is slightly less than
half of the 100° radial shift that accompanies the move of Tyr
from position 5 to position 4. The results suggest that a compromise
may be imposed by the interplay of W19 (fixed) and either Y4 or Y5
(variable), with the influence of W19 on the rotational preference
nevertheless dominating to a small extent over that of Y4 or Y5 (because
Δρo &lt; 50° in both lipids). We recall
also that the identity of residue 5 exerts a smaller influence on
the azimuthal rotation. Interestingly,
ρo decreases ∼10° when W5 is changed
to Y5, but it increases ∼10° when W5 is changed to F5;
the molecular reasons that may underlie these small but opposite values
of Δρo are elusive at this time.

The
movement of W19 to position 18 has major influence on the helix
azimuthal rotation. Interestingly, an interchange of W19 and L18 leads
to a change in ρo of +90° in DLPC but −60°
in DOPC in spite of the fact that σρ remains
low in DLPC and moderate in DOPC (Tables  and ). These results once again highlight the major
importance of W19, or more generally of the C-flanking aromatic residue,
for the helix azimuthal rotation. Moreover, the semistatic and modified
Gaussian methods agree on not only the absolute magnitudes but also
the extent of change in both lipids (Tables  and ). Why does the preferred rotation of
W18GWALP23, but not of the other peptides that experience
low dynamic averaging, depend upon the host lipid bilayer? While the
possible answers to this question remain incomplete at this time,
some clues may emerge from consideration of Figures  and . With W18 and W5 separated by
140° on the helical wheel (Figures  and ), the transmembrane helix azimuthal rotation seems
not to correlate with the W5-to-W18 separation distance along the
bilayer normal (Figure ) but rather with the
L4-to-L20 distance, which could better describe the longitudinal hydrophobic
length of the helix. Indeed, W18GWALP23 seemingly rotates
so as to minimize the L4-to-L20 transmembrane distance in DLPC and
to maximize the L4-to-L20 transmembrane distance in DOPC (Figure ). While more examples would be needed to establish
a causal relationship instead of a mere correlation, this principle
could help to explain the lipid-dependent helix rotation for the special
case of the W18GWALP23 helix.

The particular importance
of W19 for the transmembrane orientation
of GWALP23 is evident in Figure . Notably,
in GWALP23, the two Trp residues are on the same side of a helical
wheel, with a radial displacement of only 40° (Figures  and ). Rather than any
dependence on the W5-to-W19 longitudinal separation, GWALP23 rotates
in DLPC so that the distance from Cβ of W19 to the
bilayer center matches the hydrophobic thickness of a DLPC monolayer
(Figure A). From DLPC to DOPC, the main adjustment
is that GWALP23 is less tilted in DOPC. The rather minimal rotational
adjustment serves to move W19 slightly farther away from the DOPC
bilayer center (Figure B).

Concluding Remarks
For the model membrane-spanning helix of acetyl-GGALW(LA)6LWLAGA-amide (GWALP23), a well-defined transmembrane orientation
with only limited dynamic averaging, other than long-axis precession
about the bilayer normal, is retained
following the single aromatic residue substitution of F5 or Y5 in
place of W5. By contrast, all known model transmembrane peptide helices
having more than two interfacial Trp or Tyr residues characterized
to date exhibit extensive dynamic averaging of the solid-state NMR
observables. Remarkably, nevertheless, the peptide F4,5GW19ALP23 fits into the category of low dynamics and not
high dynamics, perhaps because of the absence of hydrogen-bonding
ability of the phenyl rings. Y5 confers similar properties as W5.
When the single Y5 is moved to Y4, within the context where W19 is
held constant to flank the other end of the core helix, there ensues
a change of about 40° in the preferred helix azimuthal rotation
regardless of whether the host lipid membrane is DLPC or DOPC. By
contrast, when the single W19 is moved to W18, within the context
where W5 is held constant to flank the other end of the core helix,
the preferred helix azimuthal rotation is seen to vary greatly, by
∼130°, between DLPC and DOPC. The results suggest that
a dynamic interplay between lipid membrane thickness and protein helix
rotation may regulate aspects of biological function.
