Influenza
A viruses are among
the most rapidly evolving pathogens with potential for new strains
to adapt to human hosts and lead to a pandemic outbreak, with significant
economic and public health impact., The emergence
of novel influenza strains such as 2009 H1N1 and 2010 H3N2 through
genetic reassortment− poses a constant threat in terms of the evolution
of various subtypes, including H5N1, H7N2, H7N7, H7N9, and H9N2, to
generate a pandemic strain. The H5 and H7 subtypes, among others,
are categorized as avian-adapted because they primarily circulate
within birds, but through contact with infected animals, they can
jump species and infect humans. Some of these avian-adapted viruses,
including H5N1 and H7N9, upon infection, can replicate efficiently
in various human organs and lead to severe infection and mortality.− However, these avian-adapted subtypes are not capable of efficient
human-to-human aerosol transmission,, a characteristic
feature of subtypes such as H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, which are considered
human-adapted.

A key factor governing human adaptation of the
influenza A virus
is the binding specificity of viral surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin
(HA) to sialylated glycan receptors on the host cell surface [glycans
terminated by α-d-N-acetylneuraminic
acid (Neu5Ac)]. A canonical definition of this binding specificity
based on the terminal sialic acid linkage has been used in the field
in recent decades. HA from avian-adapted subtypes such as H5, H7,
and H9 is known to bind specifically to glycans terminated by α(2→3)-linked
sialic acid [α(2→3) glycans or avian receptors]., Meanwhile, HA from human-adapted subtypes such as H1, H2, and H3
is known to bind specifically to glycans terminated by α(2→6)-linked
sialic acid., This definition based on sialic
acid linkage alone, while useful for characterizing many influenza
strains, has misclassified some notable strains in terms of their
ability to effect efficient human-to-human respiratory droplet transmission,− in particular H5N1 and H7N9.

Glycan receptors have been defined
according to their overall conformation,
via a parameter called the θ angle, which defines the form of
the nonreducing end of the glycan receptors (Figure ). Specifically, in the case
of influenza, we previously demonstrated that the apical surface of
human upper respiratory epithelia, which is a primary target for human-adapted
viruses, predominantly expresses glycan receptors with long oligosaccharide
branches terminated by α(2→6)-linked sialic acid [α(2→6)
glycan or human receptors]., On the basis of analyses
of glycan conformation and topology in HA–glycan X-ray cocrystal
structures, we noted that the α(2→6) glycans adopted
an “umbrella-like” topology (θ angle of &lt;100°)
in the receptor binding site (RBS) of H1 and H2 HAs, while α(2→6)
and α(2→3) glycans adopted “cone-like”
topologies (θ angle of &gt;100°) in the RBS of H5 HA. This topology-based definition, in addition
to the specific sialic acid linkage [i.e., α(2→3) vs
α(2→6)], distinguished HA from human-adapted subtypes
binding to human receptors from the HA of avian-adapted viruses binding
to avian and human receptors.

Schematic of
LSTc (top) and LSTa (bottom). The θ angle parameter
is defined by the angle across anomeric carbons of the three successive
residues starting from the nonreducing end (Neu5Ac, Gal-1, and GlcNAc).

The relationship between the glycan
receptor specificity of HA
and the aerosol transmissibility of the virus in ferrets (a well-established
animal model for respiratory droplet transmission) was first demonstrated
using the prototypic 1918 H1N1 pandemic HA (A/South Carolina/1/18
or SC18). While SC18 showed efficient
aerosol transmission in ferrets, a single amino acid mutation in HA
(Asp225 → Gly; numbering based on H3 HA) resulted in a virus,
NY18, that exhibited inefficient transmission, and a second further
mutation, Asp190 → Glu, resulted in a virus, AV18, that could
not be transmitted. We previously demonstrated that SC18 HA bound
with high specificity and high affinity to human receptors, while
AV18 HA bound with high affinity to avian receptors. NY18 bound to
both avian and human receptors with a binding affinity substantially
lower than that observed for AV18 and SC18. Despite dramatic differences
in the aerosol transmissibility of these three viruses and their glycan
receptor binding properties, they showed similar infectivity, replication
efficiency, and tissue distribution in ferrets directly inoculated
with virus. More recently, this approach was extended to the 2009
H1N1 system, revealing that the receptor specificity affects neither
replication nor virulence of this pandemic virus in mice or ferrets,
again after intranasal inoculation, but did affect animal-to-animal
transmission by respiratory droplets. These studies highlight the significance of HA mutations and glycan
receptor binding specificity (given that all other genes among the
three viruses are intact) in distinguishing aerosol transmissibility
from other phenotypic properties of the virus such as infectivity
and replication efficiency.

The dramatic changes in relative
glycan receptor binding affinities
and aerosol transmissibility resulting from single-amino acid changes
to SC18 prompted an investigation into the structural nuances governing
HA–glycan interactions. While HA–glycan X-ray cocrystal
structures revealed differences in overall glycan topology (cone-like
vs umbrella-like), when bound to different HAs, these “static”
structures did not entirely capture the restrictions imposed on the
conformational space of the glycan receptor by the RBS of different
HAs, in moving from the free to HA-bound state.

For what is,
to the best of our knowledge the first time, we present
solution structures of LSTc [human receptor, Neu5Ac-α(2→6)-Gal-β(1→4)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc]
and LSTa [avian receptor, Neu5Ac-α(2→3)-Gal-β(1→3)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc]
bound to SC18, NY18, and AV18 HAs, based on comprehensive nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) [saturation transfer difference spectroscopy
(STD) and transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (tr-NOESY)]
analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The combination
of both NMR and molecular dynamic simulations is particularly powerful
when investigating protein–carbohydrate interactions, specifically
when dealing with the highly mobile carbohydrate ligand. We find that these “dynamic” structures
are instrumental in delineating the conformational features of glycans
when they are bound to HA. Our study captures the active changes in
conformation, θ angle, and glycosidic linkage torsional angles
of LSTa and LSTc induced upon binding to HA and sheds light on distinct
structural constraints imposed by the RBS that differ by one or two
amino acids. We report the new finding of defining the restriction
on the glycan conformational space and mobility of glycan bound to
HA that, importantly, is not captured in the corresponding “snapshot”
cocrystal structures. Importantly, these data are consistent with
the observed differences in the biochemical binding affinities of
these glycans for SC18, NY18, and AV18 HAs. We discuss the implications
of these findings for our understanding of binding of HA to human
receptors, specifically the significance of glycan conformation, θ
angle, and glycosidic torsional angles, and HA RBS interactions in
determining the appropriate specificity and affinity. Our findings
will greatly aid future studies aimed at delineating appropriate structural
constraints on glycan topologies for other influenza subtypes (such
as H5N1 and H7N9), including surveillance of adaption to humans by
these deadly viruses.

Materials and Methods
Cloning, Baculovirus Synthesis,
Expression, and Purification
of HA
The soluble form of HA was expressed using the Baculovirus
Expression Vector System (BEVS). SC18 (A/South Carolina/1/1918) baculovirus
(generated from the pAcGP67-SC18-HA plasmid,) was a gift from J. Stevens. pAcGp67-NY18-HA and pAcGp67-AV18-HA
plasmids were generated from pAcGP67-SC18-HA by Asp225 → Gly
and Asp190 → Glu/Asp225 → Gly mutations, respectively.
Mutagenesis was conducted using the QuikChange Multi Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The primers used for mutagenesis were
designed using the web-based program PrimerX (http://bioinformatics.org/primerx/) and synthesized by IDT DNA technologies (Coralville, IA). NY18
and AV18 baculoviruses were created from pAcGP67-NY18-HA and pAcGP67-AV18-HA
constructs using a Baculogold system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The baculoviruses
were used to infect 300 mL suspension cultures of Sf9 cells (BD Biosciences)
cultured in BD BaculoGold Max-XP Insect Cell medium (BD Biosciences).
These cultures were monitored for signs of infection and harvested
4–5 days postinfection. BEVS produces trimeric HA that provides
multivalent binding to glycans. The soluble form of HA was purified
from the supernatant of infected cells using the protocol described
previously. Briefly, the supernatant
was concentrated using Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filters (Millipore,
Billerica, MA), and the trimeric HA was recovered from the concentrated
cell supernatant using affinity chromatography with columns packed
with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Eluting fractions that contained
HA were pooled and dialyzed overnight with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl
buffer (pH 8.0). Ion exchange chromatography was then performed on
the dialyzed samples using a Mono-Q HR10/10 column (GE healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ). The fractions containing HA were pooled together
and subjected to ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra 100 K NMWL membrane
filters (Millipore). The protein was then concentrated and reconstituted
in PBS. The purified protein was quantified using Bio-Rad’s
protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).

NMR Analysis of SC18, NY18,
and AV18 with LSTc and LSTa
STD and tr-NOESY samples were
prepared by washing the proteins SC18,
NY18, and AV18 (1 mg/mL) with a buffered solution [150 mM sodium chloride,
100 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 mM d-EDTA, and D2O (pH 7.2)] using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters, and a
10 kDa membrane (Millipore). Each ligand (LSTc or LSTa) was added
to the corresponding protein sample, yielding final molar ratios of
100:1 (glycan receptor:HA) for the STD measurements and 25:1 (glycan
receptor:HA) for the tr-NOESY measurements, and the protein concentration
for the STD measurements was 0.01 mM and for the tr-NOESY experiments
was 0.04 mM. NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker 600 and 900
MHz AVANCE series NMR spectrometer, both equipped with a high-sensitivity
5 mm TCI cryoprobe. LSTc and LSTa resonances were previously assigned. For the STD experiments, the on-resonance frequency
was set at 7.3 ppm (6600 Hz) and the off-resonance frequency at 20.0
ppm (18000 Hz), a train of 40 Gaussian-shaped pulses of 50 ms each
were applied to produce a selective saturation of 2 s, and D1 was
6 s. The number of scans was 1K, and the spectral width was 12626
Hz. The two-dimensional NOESY experiments were conducted using a mixing
time of 300 ms; the data were recorded for quadrature detection in
the indirect dimension and acquired using 16 scans per series of 2048
× 416 data points. The spectra were recorded at 295 K.

Dose-Dependent
Direct Binding of SC18, NY18, and AV18 to Glycan
Receptors LSTa and LSTc
LS-tetrasaccharide c [LSTc, Neu5Ac-α(2→6)-Gal-β(1→4)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc)]
and LS-tetrasaccharide a [LSTa, Neu5Ac-α(2→3)-Gal-β(1→3)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-β(1→4)-Glc]
(Accurate Chemicals) were biotinylated with EZ-Link Biotin-LC-Hydrazide
(Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Streptavidin-coated
High Binding Capacity 384-well plates (Pierce) were loaded to the
full capacity of each well by incubating the well with 50 μL
of 2.4 μM biotinylated LSTa or LSTc overnight at 4 °C.
Excess glycans were removed through extensive washing with PBS. The
trimeric HA unit comprises three HA monomers, and the spatial arrangement
of the biotinylated glycans in the wells of the streptavidin plate
array favors binding to only one of the three HA monomers in the trimeric
HA unit. To specifically enhance the correct multivalency in the HA–glycan
interactions, the recombinant HA proteins were precomplexed with the
primary and secondary antibodies in a molar ratio of 4:2:1 (HA:primary:secondary).
The identical arrangement of four trimeric HA units in the precomplex
for all the HAs permitted comparison between their glycan binding
affinities. A stock solution containing appropriate amounts of histidine-tagged
HA protein, primary antibody (mouse anti-six-His tag IgG), and secondary
antibody (HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA) was combined in a ratio 4:2:1 and incubated on ice
for 20 min. Appropriate amounts of precomplexed stock HA were diluted
to 250 μL with 1% BSA in PBS; 50 μL of this precomplexed
HA was added to each of the glycan-coated wells and incubated at room
temperature for 2 h followed by the wash steps described above. The
binding signal was determined on the basis of HRP activity using the
Amplex Red Peroxidase Assay (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The experiments were conducted in triplicate. Minimal
binding signals were observed in the negative controls, including
binding of the precomplexed unit to wells without glycans and binding
of the antibodies alone to the wells with glycans. The data obtained
from this analysis can be found in Figure 1 of the .

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
The dynamic and conformational
properties of the interaction between LSTc and HA were studied by
comparing the MD simulation trajectories of three complexes: LSTc–SC18,
LSTc–NY18, and LSTc–AV18. The X-ray cocrystal structures
of SC18 and NY18 were recently determined with LSTa and LSTc. However, during the preparation of this paper,
the available cocrystal structures were those of SC18 with LSTc [Protein
Data Bank (PDB) entry 2WRG], a swine H1N1 HA (A/swine/Iowa/30) with LSTa and
LSTc, and another human H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34, PDB entry 1RVX()) with LSTa. These X-ray cocrystal structures constituted
reasonable starting models of HA–glycan complexes for MD simulations.
The LSTc–SC18 complex was built starting with LSTc cocrystallized
with SC18 HA [PDB entry 2WRG; coordinates were available for tetrasaccharide Neu5Ac-α(2→6)-Gal-β(1→4)-GlcNAc-β(1→3)-Gal-]. The protein, HA portion, of the complex was
taken directly from the PDB coordinates, selecting a sequence of 60–260
amino acids (2WRG numbering) that includes the HA RBS. The solution conformation of
LSTc, determined previously, was superposed
onto the cocrystallized glycan structure, with the nonreducing residues
Neu5Ac and Gal-1 giving a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 6.5
Å. The remaining complexes were obtained from the previously
built LSTc–SC18 complex by applying the single mutation Asp225
→ Gly in silico to generate the LSTc–NY18
complex and the double mutation Asp225 → Gly/Asp190 →
Glu to generate the LSTc–AV18 complex. It is important to note
that at the start of the MD simulation, the three complexes are characterized
by exactly the same conformation of LSTc and HA with the exception
of mutated residues.

The LSTa–AV18 complex was built
by superimposing a previously selected conformation of LSTa on the LSTa-like trisaccharides cocrystallized
with H1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1) with amino acids within the binding
site typical of an avian HA (PDB entry 1RVX). The rmsd between the superposed glycans
is 6.2 Å, calculated on residues Neu5Ac and Gal-1. The previously
built AV18 protein was superposed on the HA in PDB entry 1RVX, matching the protein
Cα backbone (rmsd = 0.38 Å); then the complex was built
by taking LSTa and AV18. The LSTa–NY18 complex was built from
the latter complex (LSTa–AV18) by substituting Glu190 with
Asp. Even in that case, the LSTa–AV18 and LSTa–NY18
model complexes have the same geometry at the beginning of the MD
simulations.

Ambertools 1.4 was used to build the force field.
GLYCAM06/Amber
was used to describe the glycan and protein part of the complexes.
The simulation cell was built by enveloping each macromolecule by
a water layer (TIP3P water model) 15 Å wide in three directions,
resulting in an orthogonal cell with an edge of approximately 100
Å. The nonbonded potential energy was described using the standard
cutoff (12 Å) technique for both electrostatic and dispersive
interactions. Each cell was minimized using 100 K steps of the default
minimization algorithm included in NAMD. Then 1 ns of MD simulation
sampling the NPT ensemble was used to equilibrate
the cell density. The simulation temperature was set at 295 K and
maintained by a Langevin thermostat as implemented in NAMD, while
the Nosé-Hoover Langevin piston algorithm controlled the pressure
(1.01325 bar) applied to the cell walls. During the minimization and
cell density equilibration steps, a harmonic potential energy restraint
(harmonic constant of 50 kcal mol–1) on all the
atoms of the complex was applied, while the water molecules were allowed
to move freely. The MD simulation for all the modeled complexes was
∼120 ns and was completed by applying a soft harmonic restraint
on the HA backbone atoms (Cα, N, and carbonyl carbon) with a
harmonic constant of 2.0 kcal mol–1. This allows
the ligand and the side chain residues to be adjusted, while the secondary
structure elements are maintained. The MD simulation trajectory was
sampled every 10 ps, and the comparisons between the different complexes
were conducted by monitoring selected distances between the ligand
and the HA active site residues (Figure ).

MD Simulation Trajectory Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA has been a powerful tool for the analysis of protein, and glycan, molecular dynamics. Although
in these examples the PCA was used with the aim of extracting distinct
and independent motional modes, it has been used in our study to identify
the final bound states in the LSTx–HA complexes. Each frame
of the glycan–HA MD trajectories was converted from Cartesian
coordinates to a distance matrix, measured between the glycan and
protein. The distances were determined between the non-carbon and
hydrogen atoms of the glycan (excluding the glycosidic linkage oxygens
and including the carbon of the N-acetyl groups)
and the amino acid side chains of HA, the last carbon in the amino
acid side chain. A 6 Å cutoff was applied to the distance matrices;
this means that only glycan–HA interactions were observed and
not the glycan rearranging in solution, away from the RBS. These matrices
were then converted into a vector, and all of them, for a single MD
trajectory, were placed into a matrix; this data set was then mean-centered
before principal component analysis could be performed. Density-based
cluster analysis was performed on the first two component loadings
(the most significant); the time each cluster appeared in the MD trajectory
could then be compared. The first 20 ns of each trajectory was discarded;
this left the time interval from 20 to 120 ns to be investigated,
which was decomposed into 10000 distance matrices that were examined
by PCA. This approach allows the evolution of the glycan–HA
complex to be observed, from the initial state to the final state.
For the final bound states, the ϕ, ψ, and θ angles
were determined as well as the average glycan–protein contacts
for that subset of conformers. The glycan–protein contacts
are represented as networks, with the edge thickness being inversely
proportional to distance (the thicker the edge, the closer the vertices
are); these can be found in Figure  and Figures
8–11 of the .

Parameters That Define the Glycan Conformation and Topology
The torsional angles (ϕ and ψ) are defined as the following
pairs of dihedral angles: ϕ1 and ψ1, ϕ2 and ψ2, ϕ3 and ψ3, and ϕ4 and ψ4 (starting from the nonreducing termini). For LSTa, the first
pair is defined as C1–C2–O3–C3 (ϕ1) and C2–O3–C3–H3 (ψ1), while
for LSTc, ϕ1 is the C1–C2–O6–C6
angle and ψ1 the C2–O6–C6–C5
angle, as previously defined by Xu et al. Thereafter, successive pairs are defined as H1–C1–O4′–C4′
(ϕi) and C1–O4′-C4′–H4′
(ψi) for the 1→4 linkage
or H1–C1–O3′–C3′ (ϕi) and C1–O3′–C3′–H3′
(ψi) for the 1→3 linkage.
Atoms labeled with a prime belong to the monosaccharide on the reducing
side of the glycosidic linkage, while atoms without a prime are on
the nonreducing side of the glycosidic linkage. To be consistent with
Chandrasekaran et al., Xu et al., and Sassaki et al., torsional angles ϕ and ψ were illustrated in the range
of −120° to 240°. The torsional angles for the LSTc–HA
and LSTa–HA complexes are listed in Tables  and , respectively. The angles were
determined by cluster analysis of the data illustrated in Figures
13 and 14 of the , and the analysis used nonparametric density estimation to determine the members of each cluster. The
angles represented in the tables are the average values for each ϕ
and ψ cluster.

These
angles for the ligand–receptor
complexes were determined for those conformers that were extracted
by PCA: g2–g5, LSTa–NY18; g1 and g2, LSTa–AV18
(Figure 7 of the ). Unlike when LSTc is bound to HA, multiple bound states were evident
when LSTa was bound to HA. These angles were determined by cluster
analysis of the data illustrated in Figure 14 of the , and the analysis used nonparametric
density estimation to determine the members
of each cluster. These angles are average values for each ϕ
and ψ cluster.

The
topology of LSTa and LSTc is defined using a θ angle
parameter. The θ angle is defined by the C2, C1, and C1 atoms
of residues Neu5Ac, Gal, and GlcNAc (N-acetylglucosamine),
going from the nonreducing end to the reducing end (Figure ).

Results
NMR Structural Analyses
of HA–Glycan Interactions
NMR analyses were performed
using a 900 MHz spectrometer, which permitted
unprecedented resolution for observation of HA–glycan interactions.
NMR STD experiments were employed to obtain a qualitative description
of the glycan residues that interact with HA. NMR analysis indicated
that for both LSTa and LSTc (Figure ) in complex
with the different HAs, the main sugar residue involved in the contact
is the terminal sialic acid (Neu5Ac). However, there are differences
in the mode of binding for these glycans to the various HAs.

To aid the assignment of the one-dimensional STD signals, spectra
of LSTc bound to SC18 and NY18 were superimposed on the HSQC spectrum
of LSTc (Figures A and A). While the interaction between LSTc and SC18 occurs primarily
through the nonreducing end Neu5Ac moiety, involving protons H3ax,
H3eq, H4, H5, H7, and H9 (Figure A), signals
belonging to Gal-1 (H6), GlcNAc (methyl group), Gal-2 (H4 and H1),
and Glc (H5 and H6) are also present in the STD spectrum (Figure A). Similarly, LSTc interacts with NY18 principally
through Neu5Ac, (H4, H5, H7, and H9), whereas signals belonging to
Gal-2 and Glc appear to be absent or, at best, weaker than those found
in the STD spectrum of the LSTc–SC18 complex. Notably, both
methyl groups of GlcNAc and Neu5Ac still interact with NY18, but these
signals are weaker than those observed in the LSTc–SC18 complex
(Figure A).

The greater number of proton signals
corresponding to the monosaccharides
of LSTc that interact with SC18 compared to NY18 is consistent with
the dose-dependent direct biochemical binding of these HAs to this
glycan in an array platform (Figure 1 of the ) and also with previously reported human receptor
affinity of SC18 HA that is higher than that of NY18 HA. The absence of STD signals observed for the
LSTc–AV18 complex (Figure 3 of the ) indicates that LSTc does not interact with AV18,
consistent with minimal to no binding of AV18 to LSTc that is observed
in the dose-dependent binding assay (Figure 1 of the ).

The avian receptor, LSTa, on
the other hand, interacts with AV18
and NY18 almost exclusively through Neu5Ac (Figure B). Because of the overlapping signals of the methyl groups
belonging to Neu5Ac and GlcNAc, it was not possible to establish definitively
which group interacts with the corresponding HA (Figure B). Among the few STD signals that were observed for the interaction
between LSTa and AV18 or NY18 that did not belong to Neu5Ac, weak
signals were observed for H3 and H4 of Gal-1, consistent with the
partial involvement of the Gal-1 residue in binding.

Given the
conformational flexibility of glycans, arising from the
numerous glycosidic torsion angles, the parameter θ has been
defined as quantifying the form of the nonreducing end of the receptors
(Figure  and ). To compare the conformational space sampled by the
free and bound ligand, tr-NOESY experiments were performed for LSTc
interacting with SC18 and NY18 (Figure 5 of the ). Notably, via comparison of the results
from bound and unbound LSTc, the NOE signals of the GlcNAc methyl
group are substantially different. Whereas only the NOE between the
methyl group of GlcNAc and H5 of Neu5Ac was observed for unbound LSTc,
additional NOEs are observed in the bound state with SC18, including
signals associated with protons H8 and H9. These findings agree with
a decrease in the distance between the GlcNAc (CH3 protons)
and Neu5Ac (H5 and H8/H9 protons), which is probably correlated with
a reduction in the θ angle between the free and bound state.
This analysis indicates that, upon binding to SC18 and to a lesser
extent NY18, LSTc undergoes a conformational change, reducing the
θ angle and subsequently the level of conformational freedom
of the Neu5Ac residue, particularly in the region between atoms C6
and C9.

Molecular Dynamics Simulation of HA–Glycan Interactions
The impact of glycan conformational differences and points of glycan–HA
interactions observed in the NMR experiments was further investigated
using MD simulations, allowing a structural and dynamic comparison
between the various complexes (LSTc–SC18, −NY18, and
−AV18 and LSTa–AV18 and −NY18) to be made.

During the MD simulations, the conformational and dynamic properties
of the HA–glycan complexes progressively change, especially
those of the glycan conformation, with differences arising in the
complexes due to the amino acid mutations within the RBS. It should
be noted that the glycan starting geometries are the same in the two
sets of MD simulations, with the LSTa and LSTc starting geometries
taken from the solution forms identified by Sassaki et al. The mobility observed for the glycan in the
HA RBS was monitored using PCA, as described in . Briefly, the analysis was performed on the distance
matrix between the HA and receptor; unlike the conventional PCA of
protein MD simulations, which uses the position of the protein backbone
or the dihedral angles of the protein, this focuses the analysis on
the interaction between the receptor and ligand. The temporal changes
in the conformational state of the LSTc–SC18 complex are reported
in Figure 6C of the ; the conformer subset identified by cluster g3 represents the final
bound state of the complex, and a similar representation for the LSTc–NY18
and LSTc–AV18 complexes is shown in Figure 6 of the . When LSTc is bound to
any of the HAs, it appears to find a final singular state; this is
not the case for the LSTa–AV18 or LSTa–NY18 complex,
where the final state of the latter MD simulation is represented by
at least four conformational subsets (Figure 7C of the , clusters g2–g5)
and the former has two final conformational subsets (Figure 7F of
the , clusters g1
and g2), indicating a greater level of conformational freedom compared
to that for the case in which LSTc interacts with HA.

Inspection
of the MD trajectory indicates that, in the case of
the LSTc–SC18 complex, all the monosaccharides of LSTc are
positioned to interact with the RBS (Figure A and Table 1 of the ). It is also apparent that both hydrogen bonds and dispersive forces
are important components in the interaction of LSTc with SC18; specifically,
the methyl groups of GlcNAc show persistent contacts with Leu194 and
Asp190, while the methyl group of Neu5Ac interacts with Gly134 and
Trp153 (Figure A). Other noteworthy interactions
within the LSTc–SC18 complex are between Gal-1 and Gln226,
Lys222, and Asp225.

The presence of Gly instead of Asp at position
225, in going from
wild-type SC18 to NY18, removes the hydrogen bond interaction between
Gal-1 (OH3 and OH4) and the RBS (specifically involving residues Gln226,
Lys222, and Asp225), thereby promoting a greater distance between
Gal-1 and HA (loop220) compared to that in SC18 (Figures B and B and Table 1 of the ). This result is clearly
supported by the NMR STD data (Figures  and ), where Gal-1, GlcNAc, Gal-2, and Glc resonances
are absent from the spectrum of the LSTc–NY18 complex or weaker
than those in the spectrum of the wild-type complex, corresponding
to a weaker interaction.

In the LSTc–AV18 complex, the
further mutation of Asp190
to Glu introduces greater steric hindrance by preventing the optimal
interaction between the reducing end of LSTc and helix190 of AV18,
as can be seen by comparing the corresponding distances in the MD
simulation trajectories of the LSTc–AV18 complex with those
of the LSTc–SC18 and LSTc–NY18 reference complexes (Figure  and Table 1 of the ). The consequence of this is that the interaction
between Gal-1 and the HA RBS is re-established and Neu5Ac is drawn
closer to the RBS, while the interaction of GlcNAc is weaker than
that in the LSTc–SC18 and LSTc–NY18 complexes (specifically,
Asp190 and Leu194 with GlcNAc-CMe), with the whole residue moving
away from the RBS.

The analyses here reaffirm that it is interaction
of Neu5Ac, Gal-1,
and GlcNAc with HA that is important for human adaptation of influenza.
These results provide a structural description of the effect caused
by the single- and double-amino acid mutations in the RBS of HA, which
correlates with a progressive weakening of the interaction between
LSTc and HA (SC18 &gt; NY18 &gt; AV18), a result also supported by
NMR STD
experiments and the measured binding affinities.

In the case
of the LSTa–AV18 complex, the primary contacts
involve Neu5Ac of LSTa, with the carboxyl, acetyl, and sialyl groups
of Neu5Ac interacting with the HA RBS (Figure C and Figure 8 and Table
2 of the ). Importantly,
contacts are also observed between AV18 and Gal-1 in LSTa. This involves
the interaction of O6-Gal-2 with Glu190 and Pro186, which is afforded
by the presence of the α(2→3) linkage in LSTa. PCA of
the LSTa–AV18 MD simulation trajectory also indicates the mobility
of the reducing end region of LSTa is greater than that of its nonreducing
terminus (Neu5Ac), which remains strongly attached to the RBS on the
MD simulation time scale (Figures 7 and Figure 8 and Table 2 of the ). In the case of the LSTa–NY18
complex, the mutation of Glu190 to Asp reduces the extent of interaction
between Gal-1 and the RBS, with only the nonreducing end Neu5Ac residue
interacting with the RBS. A consequence of this is that the number
of interactions between the sialyl group of Neu5Ac and the RBS is
decreased and the interaction between Gln226 and the carboxyl group
of Neu5Ac is no longer observed (Figure D
and Figure 9 and Table 3 of the ). This corresponds to a weaker interaction between LSTa and NY18
than between LSTa and AV18, in agreement with the NMR STD experiments
and biochemical assay. The LSTa–NY18 complex samples two conformational
states during the MD simulation, which differ on the basis of contacts
between Neu5Ac and the HA RBS (Figure 9 of the ). The features of binding of LSTa to
AV18 and NY18 obtained from the MD simulations are consistent with
the corresponding NMR STD signals, where data from both complexes
indicate that Neu5Ac is the main interacting residue with HA, while
the methyl group of GlcNAc is no longer a key point of interaction
with either NY18 or AV18.

We have compared the available X-ray
crystallographic structures
with our MD and NMR structures (Figures 10 and 11 of the ). The comparisons have
been limited to glycan–protein contact networks as the forms
of the glycans within the crystal structures are distorted, precluding
the determination of conformational angles.

Contact network between LSTc and HA. If two vertices are
linked,
they are &lt;6 Å apart; the thicknesses of the graph edges are
inversely proportional to the distance between the glycan atom (circular
vertex) and the protein amino acid (square vertex) (the thicker the
edge, the closer the two are together). The square vertices that are
white with a black boundary indicate that this amino acid has been
mutated, for example, Asp190 → Glu. The networks represent
the average distances found in the final, “bound”, conformer
subsets identified by PCA (Figure 6 of the ): cluster g3, LSTc–SC18; cluster g2, LSTc–AV18;
and cluster g2, LSTc–NY18. The distances illustrated here are
listed in Table 1 of the . In this figure, the distinct modes of the interaction between LSTc
and HA (SC18, NY18, and AV18) can be observed. When binding to its
natural ligand, SC18, LSTc interacts with HA along its entire length.
The single-point mutation forming NY18, Asp225 → Gly, drastically
alters the interaction between the nonreducing end of the receptor
and HA, and the major interactions with Gal-1 are abolished (panel
B compared to panel A). The additional modification forming AV18,
Asp190 → Glu, allows Gal-1 to re-engage with HA, which leads
to the interaction between GlcNAc and amino acids 190 and Ser193 being
lost (compare panel C to panels B and A).

Dynamics of LSTa and LSTc Conformations upon Binding to HA
The θ angle parameter is a key conformational descriptor
of the nonreducing end of the glycan receptor, indicating the different
forms of the glycans. As shown previously, the θ angle of unbound
LSTc had a predominant distribution at 86° and a smaller population
located at 119° (Figure A). Binding to SC18 substantially restricts the
conformational population of LSTc, as reflected by the narrow distribution
of the θ parameter, with a single distribution centered at 82°.
Binding to NY18 also restricts the conformational space sampled by
LSTc, with a θ angle distribution being located at approximately
90°. Interestingly, the small population of θ angle values
around 119° in the unbound LSTc is absent in the bound state,
consistent with an earlier study in which it was postulated that long α(2→6)
glycans would predominantly adopt an umbrella-like topology (characterized
by θ &lt; 100°) when bound to the RBS of human-adapted
HAs.

Density distribution plots of the topological
θ angles of
LSTc (A) and LSTa (B) free and bound to HA. The interaction of LSTc
or LSTa with HA alters the topological θ angle assumed by the
glycan receptor. The θ angles shown here are for the PCA-extracted
conformers; a comparison of these with the θ angles for all
of the conformers can be found in Figure 12 of the .

This restriction of the θ angle when LSTc binds to
SC18 and
NY18 is supported experimentally by the new NOE signal appearing between
GlcNAc and Neu5Ac H8/H9 in the tr-NOESY spectra of the LSTc–SC18
complex and by the stronger NOE signal between GlcNAc and Neu5Ac H5
in the LSTc–NY18 complex (Figure 5 of the ). In contrast, low-affinity interaction
of LSTc with AV18 predominantly samples the cone-like topology as
indicated by the θ distribution around 113°, which is consistent
with the constraints imposed by avian-adapted HAs and is due to the lack on interaction between GlcNAc and
the RBS. These results re-emphasize the ability of human receptors
to sample a distinct set of topologies (both umbrella-like and cone-like)
in the RBS of SC18, NY18, and AV18 HA.

In the unbound state,
the θ angle of LSTa samples two distinct
populations centered around 118° and 154° (Figure B), both of which correspond to cone-like topologies
(θ &gt; 100°). The binding of LSTa to NY18 does not significantly
alter the position of the θ angle distribution compared to that
of free glycan, distributions located at 117° and 158° in
the bound state, but does affect strongly their relative populations,
with the population located at the smaller θ angle being the
largest. The binding of LSTa to AV18 HA imposes restrictions on the
θ angle, removing the population distributed around 117°
(Figure B). Consistent with our previous studies,
the avian receptor LSTa adopts exclusively a cone-like topology regardless
of whether it is present in the unbound form or is bound to NY18 or
AV18 HA. For the sake of completeness, the θ angle density plots
for the entire MD trajectory (20–100 ns) can be found in Figure
12 of the .

To complete our conformational studies, we also considered the
glycosidic torsion angles of the free and bound glycan receptor sampled
during the MD simulation; in the case of the bound receptors, the
conformer subset extracted by PCA is considered (Tables  and ).

First, consistent with
the θ angle distributions described
above, comparison of the glycosidic torsional angles in the unbound
and various HA-bound glycans indicates there are distinct structural
constraints imposed by the RBS of SC18, NY18, and AV18 HA on LSTa
and LSTc. When LSTc binds to SC18 and NY18, the distributions of states
seen for ϕ1 and ψ1, ϕ2 and ψ2, and ϕ3 and ψ3 are very similar; only by using density cluster analysis
is it possible to observe the different central locations of the states
(Figure 13 and Table 1 of the ). Indicating the modification of amino acid 190 (Asp → Gly)
and the subsequent change in the interaction between LSTc and HA,
the loss of the interaction of Gal-1 with Gln226, Asp225, and Lys222
does not have a strong effect on the glycosidic torsional angles,
whereas binding of LSTc to AV18 modifies amino acids 190 and 225,
which eradicates the interaction between GlcNAc and Leu194, Asp190,
and Ser193, affecting the positions of ϕ2 and ψ2 and those of ϕ3 and ψ3,
which are distinct from those observed in the LSTc–SC18 and
LSTc–NY18 complexes (Figure 13 and Table 1 of the ).

When LSTa binds
to HA, the interactions with AV18 and NY18 are
very different. The interaction between LSTa and NY18 is solely through
the nonreducing end Neu5Ac (Figure 9 of the ), and this is evident in the diversity of states
observed for ϕ2 and ψ2, ϕ3 and ψ3, and ϕ4 and ψ4 (Figure 14 and Table 2 of the ). The opposite is seen for the LSTa–AV18
complex; even though the glycan is dynamic with four conformational
states being extracted by PCA of the MD trajectory of the complexes
(Figure 7 of the ), the glycosidic torsional angle states observed in the glycan are
restricted for all four linkages.

Discussion and Conclusion
The NMR and MD simulation analyses described in this study offer
new insights into the interaction between hemagglutinin and its glycan
receptors, providing a detailed description of the contacts observed
in the interactions between LSTc and LSTa with human- and avian-adapted
HA and the consequent change in glycan conformation. The principal
consequence of modifying SC18 to form NY18, Asp225 → Gly, is
that Gal-1 of LSTc can no longer interact with the HA RBS (Gln226,
Lys222, and amino acid 225), which allows Gal-1 to move away from
the protein surface, also affecting the interaction between the Neu5Ac
residue of LSTc and the RBS. A further second modification forming
the avian-adapted AV18, Asp190 → Glu, permits Gal-1 of LSTc
to re-engage with the HA RBS, interacting with Gly225 and Lys222.
While GlcNAc can no longer interact with the RBS in the LSTc–AV18
complex, it is this interaction that is a key decider for human adaption
(Figure ). The
interaction between LSTa and AV18, avian-adapted HA, is principally
via Neu5Ac and Gal-1 of the receptor. The nonreducing end α(2→3)
linkage between Neu5Ac and Gal-1 in LSTa permits Glu190 and Pro186
to interact with the sialyl group of Neu5Ac and O6-Gal-1 of LSTa.

The interaction between the glycan receptors and HA imposes conformational
constraints upon the glycan, which is characterized in terms of the
θ angle and the glycosidic torsional angles. We also correlated
this analysis with biochemical HA–glycan binding specificity
and affinity to ensure that this analysis is consistent with available
crystal structure information. Importantly, using the θ angle
as a parameter to characterize the overall shape of the glycan, our
study demonstrates key differences in the form of LSTa and LSTc when
they are free versus their bound states (LSTc–SC18, −NY18,
and −AV18 and LSTa–AV18 and −NY18), which have
not been possible to “capture” through X-ray crystal
structures.

Previously, we have noted that human receptors in
their unbound
state sample a conformational space that resembles both a cone-like
topology (θ ≥ 110°) and an umbrella-like topology
(θ &lt; 100°), whereas avian receptors exclusively sample
a cone-like topology. By analyzing HA–glycan
cocrystal structures, we postulated that glycans binding to “avian-adapted”
HA RBS (such as AV18) would impose constraints on the human receptor
(for example, LSTc) to preferentially sample a cone-like topology,
whereas glycans binding to “human-adapted” HA (such
as SC18) would constrain the glycan to preferentially sample an umbrella-like
topology. On the basis of the NMR analyses
and MD simulations presented here, we demonstrate the former hypothesis
to be correct. The θ angle of LSTc (Figure A) samples two distinct
populations in the unbound state corresponding to umbrella-like and
cone-like topologies. Upon binding to AV18 HA, LSTc predominantly
samples a cone-like topology (θ ∼ 110°); this is
due to GlcNAc of LSTc not being able to interact with the HA RBS.
On the other hand, binding to the RBS of SC18 or NY18 imposes constraints
on LSTc such that the glycan exclusively samples an umbrella-like
topology.

Furthermore, compared to free LSTc, the bound glycan
has restricted
glycosidic torsional angles, with the torsional states observed for
the LSTc–SC18 and LSTc–NY18 complexes being similar,
whereas the mutation of Asp190 to Gly, seen in AV18, which abolishes
the interaction between GlcNAc of LSTc and HA, produces unique glycosidic
angles for ϕ2 and ψ2 and for ϕ3 and ψ3, which are distinct from those seen
in the LSTc–SC18 and LSTc–NY18 complexes. This restriction
in the glycosidic torsional angles is also observed in the LSTa–AV18
complex, even though the receptor is dynamic in the RBS, as indicated
by the multiple states observed at the end of the MD simulation (Figures
7 and 8 of the ),
whereas in the LSTa–NY18 complex, where the nonreducing end
Neu5Ac is the sole point of interaction with HA, linkages ϕ2 and ψ2, ϕ3 and ψ3, and ϕ4 and ψ4 all have
glycosidic torsional angles that are similar to those seen in the
free glycan (Figure 14 of the ).

This stronger restriction correlates with a greater number
of LSTc–SC18
HA contacts, which can be observed in the NMR STD measurements and
higher measured binding affinity compared to those of the LSTc–NY18
HA complex. The constraints on the avian receptor, LSTa, are consistent
with the predominant contacts made by HA RBS with the Neu5Ac-α(2→3)-Gal
motif as measured by NMR STD signals, which permit a higher degree
of flexibility to the sugars on the reducing end of this terminal
motif (as seen in the conformational map of ϕ3 and
ψ3 and of ϕ4 and ψ4 in Figure 14 of the ).

The results presented here clearly indicate that even one
or two
amino acid changes in the HA RBS impose different constraints on the
conformation and topology of bound glycan receptors, which in turn
governs the biochemical binding specificity and affinity. On the basis
of this evidence, it is important to carefully assess the effects
of transferring amino acid changes that lead to specific receptor
binding properties for a given HA to, and from, a completely different
strain or subtype. As stated earlier, the receptor specificity of
avian- and human-adapted HAs has been broadly classified solely on
the basis of a preference for α(2→3)- and α(2→6)-linked
sialic acid. On the basis of the data presented here, we find that
the amino acid composition of the RBS of various avian-adapted HA
subtypes would critically govern structural constraints imposed on
diverse and distinct sets of glycans expressed in different tissues,
consistent with the ability of viruses from H5, H7, and H9 subtypes
to infect distinct tissue types. On the other hand, human-adapted
HAs share the characteristic binding to glycans expressed in human
upper respiratory epithelia (particularly nonciliated goblet cells).,, This characteristic binding can
be explained on the basis of the structural constraints imposed by
SC18 and NY18 on LSTc, which, in turn, is reflected by the θ
parameter distribution. Given that goblet cells secrete mucins, it
is possible that the characteristic binding of human-adapted HAs to
these cell types would increase their propensity for aerosol formation
and transmission.

Finally, the methods and framework presented
in this study to measure
the restriction imposed by the RBS of different HAs on the conformational
space and topology sampled by glycan receptors can serve as a very
useful tool for allowing more exact surveillance of emerging influenza
viruses such as H7N9 and H5N1, to closely monitor their ability to
bind to human receptors and acquire the capability for human-to-human
transmission.
