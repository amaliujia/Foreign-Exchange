Aβ42
peptides associate into soluble oligomers and protofibrils
in the process of forming the amyloid fibrils associated with Alzheimer’s
disease. The oligomers have been reported to be more toxic to neurons
than fibrils, and have been targeted by a wide range of small molecule
and peptide inhibitors. With single touch atomic force microscopy
(AFM), we show that monomeric Aβ42 forms two distinct types
of oligomers, low molecular weight (MW) oligomers with heights of
1–2 nm and high MW oligomers with heights of 3–5 nm.
In both cases, the oligomers are disc-shaped with diameters of ∼10–15
nm. The similar diameters suggest that the low MW species stack to
form the high MW oligomers. The ability of Aβ42 inhibitors to
interact with these oligomers is probed using atomic force microscopy
and NMR spectroscopy. We show that curcumin and resveratrol bind to
the N-terminus (residues 5–20) of Aβ42 monomers and cap
the height of the oligomers that are formed at 1–2 nm. A second
class of inhibitors, which includes sulindac sulfide and indomethacin,
exhibit very weak interactions across the Aβ42 sequence and
do not block the formation of the high MW oligomers. The correlation
between N-terminal interactions and capping of the height of the Aβ
oligomers provides insights into the mechanism of inhibition and the
pathway of Aβ aggregation.

Alzheimer’s
disease (AD)
is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of
amyloid plaques in the brain. These plaques are composed mostly of
Aβ peptides generated by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor
protein (APP) by two proteases, β- and γ-secretase.1,2 The primary cleavage product is an Aβ peptide with a length
of 40 residues (Aβ40). However, proteolysis is not highly specific
and ∼10% of the cleavage products of APP are peptides with
two additional amino acids at the C-terminus (Aβ42). The Aβ42
peptide is more toxic to neuronal cells than Aβ40,3 and post-mortem analysis reveals Aβ42 to
be the principal component of amyloid plaques in AD patients.4 Several familial mutations in the APP gene associated
with early onset AD have been found to increase the ratio of Aβ42-to-Aβ40.5 These observations have led to the conclusion
that Aβ42 plays a pivotal role in the progression of AD.

One of the challenges in designing Aβ42 inhibitors and understanding
their ability to block Aβ toxicity has been that the Aβ42
monomers rapidly associate to form low molecular weight (MW) oligomers
which can subsequently combine to form higher MW oligomers, protofibrils,
and fibrils. This association results in a complex mixture of Aβ
aggregates whose structures change over time. Although early findings
in the amyloid field implicated the fibrillar deposits in the brains
of AD patients as the cause of neuronal toxicity, more recent results
have suggested that small soluble oligomers are the primary toxic
species.6−8

There is rich literature on the pathways for
Aβ association
and the structures of possible intermediates en route to forming fibrils.6,7,9,10 There
is general agreement that monomeric Aβ produced by γ-secretase
cleavage is not toxic.11 There is much
less agreement on the pathway(s) of oligomer formation, and the size
and composition of the oligomers. In in vitro studies, the monomer
concentration and solution temperature are two critical parameters
controlling Aβ oligomer formation. The Aβ42 peptide is
monomeric up to a concentration of ∼3 μM at 25 °C,12 and low temperature (4 °C) can be used
to stabilize the monomer at higher concentrations.13,14 Oligomers readily form at higher concentrations and temperature;
the kinetics of oligomer and fibril formation are strongly dependent
on the concentration and temperature used.15,16 The temperature dependence of the association suggests that monomeric
Aβ42 first associates through hydrophobic interactions to form
soluble oligomers.

Although a host of other factors influence
the aggregation of the
Aβ peptides, including salt concentration, pH, and the presence
of metal ions,17 there appear to be two
general size classifications of soluble oligomers, low and high MW.
Low MW oligomers of Aβ42 have been observed at ∼20 kDa
by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis.6,18,19 This MW roughly corresponds to a tetramer. Ion mobility
measurements obtained using mass spectrometry show that the low MW
forms are predominantly tetramers with smaller amounts of dimers and
hexamers.20 On the basis of photochemical
cross-linking, Bitan, Teplow, and co-workers21 concluded that the stable Aβ42 oligomers isolated by size-exclusion
chromatography are predominantly pentamers and hexamers. Together,
these results show that while there is a small range of low MW oligomer
sizes, the low MW oligomers do not have a defined composition or structure.

High MW oligomers are a second general size classification of soluble
oligomers. The most commonly observed high MW oligomer has a molecular
mass of ∼56 kDa, corresponding to a dodecamer. The high MW
oligomers appear to be more toxic in vitro and in vivo compared to
Aβ42 monomers, low MW oligomers, and fibrils,9,22−24 although Aβ dimers isolated from the AD brains
were shown to impair synaptic plasticity.25 For example, Lesne et al.9 found that
an oligomeric species, which they term Aβ*56 on the basis of
an apparent MW of 56 kDa, can impair memory in transgenic mice expressing
human APP. Barghorn et al.24 also describe
the production of a ∼60 kDa Aβ42 oligomer that binds
to dendritic processes of neurons in cell culture and blocks long-term
potentiation in rat hippocampal slices. Ion mobility studies with
mass spectrometry showed that dodecamers are the predominant higher
order oligomeric form of Aβ42.20 The
absence of an 18-mer species in these studies suggested that the hexamers
(or other small oligomers) do not associate with the dodecamer. Rather,
it was proposed that the dodecamer rearranges and forms fibrils.

Many Aβ inhibitors prevent fibril formation or disrupt mature
fibrils,26−32 and potentially give rise to toxic Aβ species.33 Aβ42 inhibitors have been shown by NMR
to interact with the N-terminus (residues 1–20) and C-terminus
(residues 31–42) of the peptide. Both the N- and C-termini
influence the transition of Aβ monomers to fibrils. The hydrophobic
C-terminus of Aβ42 has long been recognized as important in
driving fibril formation.34 Structural
models place the C-terminus at the core of Aβ4035 and Aβ4236 fibrils, and
inhibitors have been designed to disrupt the packing within the C-terminus.36,37 Although the N-terminus is unstructured in fibril models and believed
to not be important in the final folded fibril,38,39 several studies suggest that it has a role in fibril formation.40−43

In this study, we combine high resolution atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and NMR to characterize the size of the oligomers and their
interaction with several different types of Aβ42 inhibitors.
Due to differences in oligomer height, AFM allows us to distinguish
low and high MW oligomers. We have previously shown that single touch
AFM provides a low force method to image oligomers with high resolution
under hydrated conditions.44 NMR spectroscopy
provides a way to assess the sites of Aβ–inhibitor interaction.
Two-dimensional 1H–15N correlation experiments
allow one to monitor the specific residues that contribute to inhibitor
binding using previous backbone assignments for Aβ42.13,45 Our current studies focus on the incubation of Aβ42 at concentrations
of ∼50–200 μM, above the critical concentration
for Aβ42 aggregation.46

We
investigate two classes of inhibitors that interact predominantly
either with the N-terminus (and central KLVFF region) of the Aβ
peptide or with the hydrophobic C-terminus. Curcumin, the yellow pigment
in turmeric, has been studied extensively as an inhibitor of Aβ42
fibril formation (for a review, see ref (47)), and falls into the class of N-terminal inhibitors.
Ono et al.48 found that curcumin can block
fibril formation and lower toxicity. NMR studies show that interactions
predominantly occur at the N-terminus of the peptide. There are many
polyphenolic compounds that appear to behave like curcumin in terms
of binding to Aβ42 and inhibiting fibril formation. We also
target resveratrol, another common natural product found in wine,
which inhibits Aβ42 fibril formation and cytotoxicity but not
Aβ42 oligomerization.49

The
second class of inhibitors we target are small molecule nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that have been developed to treat
acute or chronic inflammation, but have also been studied extensively
as therapeutics for AD. We present AFM and NMR data on two NSAIDs,
sulindac sulfide and indomethacin, which have similar structures and
have been reported to bind to Aβ42 and inhibit fibril formation.37,50 Importantly, Richter et al.37 found that
the addition of sulindac sulfide in a 1:3 molar ratio of Aβ42
to inhibitor resulted in changes in the chemical shifts of residues
in the Aβ42 C-terminus (Ile32, Leu34, Met35, and Val39) using
NMR spectroscopy.

Curcumin and resveratrol are natural products
that are widely consumed,
while sulindac sulfide and indomethacin are representative of a class
of pharmaceuticals (NSAIDs) commonly prescribed for chronic inflammation.
Our studies directly compare these two types of Aβ inhibitors
and address whether the location of inhibitor binding influences the
structure or formation of the different size oligomers.

Materials and
Methods
Preparation of Oligomers
Aβ42 peptides were synthesized
using tBOC-chemistry on an ABI 430A solid-phase peptide synthesizer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and purified by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using linear water–acetonitrile
gradients containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Based on analytical
reverse phase HPLC, the purity of the peptides was 90–95%.
The mass of the purified peptide was measured using matrix-assisted
laser desorption or electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and
was consistent with the calculated mass for the peptide.

Monomeric
Aβ42 was prepared by dissolving purified peptide in 100 mM NaOH,
diluting into low salt buffer (10 mM phosphate, 10 mM NaCl) at low
temperature (4 °C), and adjusting the pH to 7.4. The Aβ
solutions were then filtered two times with 0.2 μm cellulose
acetate filters to remove insoluble aggregates that can nucleate and
influence aggregation. Unless otherwise indicated, the final concentration
of Aβ42 monomer was adjusted to 200 μM for the studies
described below. To initiate Aβ aggregation, the solutions of
monomeric peptide at 4 °C were placed in a 37 °C incubator
and slowly shaken. For AFM measurements and fluorescence measurements,
aliquots of the peptide solution were removed at time points between
0 and 48 h and diluted to &lt;20 μM immediately before the measurement.
In parallel with this study, we have undertaken a detailed characterization
of the influence of concentration and temperature on Aβ42 aggregation
(Fu et al., unpublished results). The concentration (200 μM)
and temperature (37 °C) used here are favorable for the conversion
of monomeric Aβ to oligomers prior to fibril formation through
the mechanism of nucleated conformational conversion.

Small
molecule inhibitors were cosolubilized with Aβ42 in
selected experiments by mixing concentrated stock solutions of inhibitors
and Aβ42 in 100 mM NaOH, and then diluting the mixture into
low salt buffer (10 mM phosphate, 10 mM NaCl) at low temperature (4
°C) and adjusting the pH to 7.4. All experiments reported here
used a molar ratio of Aβ42:inhibitor of 1:1. Since curcumin
is unstable in aqueous solution and in the presence of light,51 the solutions were kept in the dark, and absorption
spectra were obtained to estimate the amount of degradation (Supporting Information Figure S2). Over the 10
h time course of the AFM measurements, we lose ∼50% of the
initial curcumin in these samples, and consequently we cannot rule
out that curcumin degradation products contribute to the observed
capping of low MW oligomers.

For NMR experiments, 15N- labeled Aβ42 peptide
(rPeptide, Bogart, GA) was dissolved in 100 mM NaOH at a concentration
of 2.2 mM, then diluted in low salt buffer containing 10% D2O to a 200 μM concentration. The concentrations of the peptide
stock solutions were determined by absorbance at 275 nm using the
extinction coefficient for tyrosine of 1420 M–1 cm–1. The concentrations of the inhibitor stock solutions
were determined by absorbance and/or NMR spectroscopy. The stock solutions
in NaOH were made immediately prior to use.

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM images were obtained using
a MultiMode microscope (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) with
a custom-built controller (LifeAFM, Port Jefferson, NY) that allows
one low force contact (30–50 piconewtons) of the AFM tip to
the sample surface per pixel. The single touch approach is rapid and
allows one to image a 1 μm × 1 μm field in ∼4
min. The AFM operation is embedded in a computer program that provides
subangstrom linear control of cantilever base and tip position, including
programmed contact and programmed separation of the tip by a magnetic
force ramp. Supersharp silicon probes with a tip width of typically
3–5 nm (at a height of 2 nm) were modified for magnetic retraction
by attachment of samarium cobalt particles. Figure
S3 presents an image of DNA showing the helical repeat of 3.4
nm, which provides an estimate of the resolution in the single touch
AFM experiments and shows how the tip width of the AFM probe influences
the observed width of the sample, but not the height. The oligomer
diameters that are reported account for the width of the AFM probe.18,44 Samples for AFM were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 μM
deposited onto freshly cleaved ruby mica (S &amp; J Trading, Glen
Oaks, NY) and imaged under hydrated conditions. The AFM instrument
used in our studies does not have temperature control, and in the
case of our initial t = 0 h time point, the Aβ42
oligomers rapidly form from monomeric Aβ as the sample temperature
increases from 4 °C as the sample is layered on the mica surface
for measurements. The total time for layering the samples and acquiring
images is ∼15 min. At least five regions of the mica surface
were examined to ensure that similar structures existed throughout
the sample. Histograms were compiled using Microsoft Excel from nonoverlapping
particles in multiple fields.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence experiments
were performed using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog FL3-22 spectrofluorimeter.
At each time point, aliquots were taken and mixed with 30 μM
thioflavin T to produce mixtures with a peptide-to-thioflavin T ratio
of 1:20. Thioflavin T fluorescence emission spectra were obtained
from 475 to 550 nm using an excitation wavelength of 461 nm.

Solution
NMR Spectroscopy
NMR spectra of Aβ42
oligomers were obtained at 700 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer
with a TXI probe. The temperature was maintained at 4 °C to reduce
peptide fibrillization. NMR measurements were made with standard 5
mm NMR tubes containing a Teflon tube liner (Norell, Inc.). The Teflon
liner prevents glass catalyzed Aβ aggregation. 1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra
were acquired using pulse field gradient water suppression and GARP
decoupling with the transmitter offset placed at the water frequency.
The number of points acquired in the direct dimension (1H) was 2048, and the number of increments in the indirect dimension
(15N) was 128. The data in the indirect dimension were
linear predicted to 256 points before Fourier transformation for a
spectral resolution of 1.38 Hz/point in the 1H dimension
and 8.82 Hz/point in the 15N dimension. Assignments were
taken from refs (13) and (45).

Results
Stacking
of Aβ42 Oligomers
Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are used to visualize
the formation of oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils from monomeric
Aβ peptides. AFM (Figure 1A,B) is most
often used for imaging oligomers, while TEM is used primarily for
imaging protofibrils and fibrils. Monomeric Aβ42 is not generally
observed by either method. However, there is general agreement in
the literature that low temperature can be used to stabilize monomeric
Aβ.13,14,52 In the Supporting Information (Figure S4) and Materials and Methods, we describe the preparation
of monomeric Aβ42 by disaggregating in NaOH, titrating to pH
7.4, and diluting into buffer at 4 °C. The solutions are then
filtered at 4 °C prior to use in order to remove aggregated Aβ
that can seed fibril formation. Diffusion measurements are used to
show that the Aβ42 peptide is monomeric at 4 °C and converts
to a low MW oligomeric species with a size corresponding to a hexamer
after incubation at 20 °C (Figure S4).

Figure 1 Single-touch AFM of Aβ42 oligomers. The AFM image in (A)
was obtained of oligomers starting with monomeric Aβ42 stabilized
at low temperature (4 °C) for 72 h in 10 mM phosphate, 10 mM
NaCl buffer prior to AFM measurements. The peptides are largely monomeric
prior to warming the solution as it is layered on the mica grid for
imaging. Warming to room temperature causes a rapid conversion to
Aβ42 oligomers with heights of ∼1.5–2.5 nm. (B)
At higher temperature (37 °C, 6 h), the number of 3–5
nm high oligomers rapidly increases. The height measurements by AFM
are accurate to within ∼0.1 nm.44 The scale bars are 100 nm. (C) Cartoon of Aβ42 low and high
MW oligomers illustrating that stacking doubles the height of the
oligomers without changing their diameter. NMR diffusion measurements
were used to establish the presence of monomeric Aβ42 at low
temperature (Figure S4). Mass spectrometry20 and cross-linking21 suggest that the low MW oligomers correspond to tetramers, pentamers,
and hexamers. On native gels, we observe a band at ∼20 kDa,
corresponding to the MW between a tetramer and pentamer. Diffusion
measurements reveal the formation of oligomers with a diffusion coefficient
close to that of a 26 kDa globular protein (Figure
S4).

Figure 1A presents an AFM image of low MW
oligomers. These oligomers rapidly form from Aβ42 monomers after
increasing the temperature or increasing the Aβ concentration.
One of the advantages of AFM is the ability to image the size and
shape of the Aβ oligomers during the aggregation process. Figure 1A shows that monomeric Aβ42 at 4 °C,
when warmed to room temperature, yields a relatively homogeneous field
of oligomers with heights of ∼1.0–2.0 nm. Incubation
of Aβ42 at ∼15 °C or higher allows formation of
oligomers, protofibrils and finally mature fibrils. Figure 1B shows that after 6 h of incubation at 37 °C
the oligomers predominantly have heights of 3–5 nm.

One
can follow the transition of the short (low MW) oligomers to
tall (high MW oligomers) by measuring the oligomer heights as a function
of incubation time (Figure 2A). There is a
gradual shift of the low MW oligomers to high MW oligomers over an
8 h incubation period at 37 °C. Figure 2B summarizes this shift in height by counting oligomers in the range
of 1.0–2.5 nm and in the range of 3–5 nm.

Figure 2 Time course
of oligomer and fibril formation. (A) Histograms of
Aβ42 oligomer height after 0–8 h of incubation. The heights
of the Aβ42 oligomers were obtained by AFM at 37 °C in
low salt buffer. (B) Conversion of short to tall Aβ42 oligomers
over 8 h of incubation based on heights measured by AFM. The plot
shows the number of oligomers with heights between 1.0–2.5
nm (black squares) and between 3–5 nm (gray circles). The analysis
in (B) was based on at least three independent data sets for each
time point. The AFM measurements only yield the relative numbers of each oligomer type as a function of the incubation time.
The total number of oligomers decreases with time. However, here we
normalize the total number of oligomers to 100 at each incubation
time point. The change in thioflavin T fluorescence over a similar
time scale is shown on the same plot (blue diamonds, solid line).

The time course for oligomer heights
is plotted on the same graph
as the change in thioflavin T fluorescence. Thioflavin T has been
widely used to characterize the time dependence of fibril formation.
Thioflavin T exhibits an increase in fluorescence intensity at 490
nm when bound to Aβ42 fibrils, but not when bound to monomeric
Aβ.53 In Figure 2B (blue trace), we show that when incubated with Aβ42
the thioflavin T fluorescence exhibits a lag phase typical of nucleation
dependent fibril formation. A sharp increase in fluorescence is observed
after 6–7 h. The time course of fibril formation reflected
by the thioflavin T fluorescence is largely consistent with the TEM
images showing oligomers and protofibrils prior to 6 h and protofibrils
and fibrils after 6 h (Figure S5). These
images are consistent with the AFM studies showing that the high MW
oligomers are formed prior to fibril formation. Similar experiments
were undertaken with Aβ42 originally solubilized in DMSO rather
than NaOH (Figure S1). The DMSO leads to
a delay in the Aβ aggregation kinetics, but the transition of
low to high MW oligomers is still observed prior to fibril formation.

The AFM images of Aβ42 oligomers in Figure 1A and B reveal a mixture of two distinct populations characterized
by their heights. The height measurement in AFM is extremely accurate
(±0.1 nm) and the low force, single touch approach reduces distortion
of the height during the imaging process.44 Although the heights of the Aβ42 oligomers increase as a function
of time, the diameters remain roughly the same, between ∼10
and 15 nm (Figure 1A, B). The diameters of
the oligomers observed in the AFM images are sensitive to the width
of the tip of the AFM probe (see Figure S3).44 With relatively broad tips, the apparent
oligomer widths can be on the order of 25 nm. However, even in these
cases, the low and high MW oligomers have similar diameters. The observation
of two populations that differ in height without a large change in
diameter argues that the oligomers are disc-shaped rather than spherical.
The disc shape, along with the time-dependent increase in height,
suggests that the low MW oligomers stack to form the high MW oligomers,
and that this stacking precedes fibril formation.

Small Molecule
Inhibitors Cap Oligomers of Aβ42
The influence of Aβ42
inhibitors on the distribution of the
low and high MW oligomers was assessed by AFM. We selected several
inhibitors that bind to Aβ and either slow or prevent fibril
formation.33 Figure 3A and B compares the distribution of heights of Aβ42 after
6 h of incubation with and without curcumin or resveratrol added at
a 1:1 molar ratio of Aβ monomer-to-inhibitor. The 6 h time point
corresponds to the end of the lag phase observed by thioflavin T fluorescence.
At this time point, which is prior to the rapid appearance of fibrils
in TEM images, there is a large increase in the high MW oligomers
and protofibrils relative to the low MW oligomers. When incubated
with either curcumin or resveratrol at a 1:1 molar ratio, the heights
of the Aβ42 oligomers are capped at ∼2.5 nm. Representative
AFM images of inhibited samples after 6 h of incubation are shown
in Figure 3C and D. It is well-known that curcumin
is unstable in aqueous solution, and degrades to vanillin, ferulic
acid, feruloyl methane, and trans-6-(4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyphenyl)-2,4-dioxo-5-hexenal.51 While the stability of curcumin is enhanced
by binding to Aβ42 (Figure S2), there
is still significant degradation over the time course of these experiments
and consequently the degradation products may contribute to capping
of the low MW oligomers.

Figure 3 Capping of oligomer heights by inhibitors. (A)
Capping of Aβ42
oligomer heights by curcumin. Histograms are shown of oligomer heights
obtained from AFM images after 6 h of incubation of Aβ42 either
with (black bars) or without (blue bars) curcumin. The temperature
was maintained at 37 °C and the molar ratio of curcumin-to-Aβ42
was 1:1. (B) Capping of Aβ42 oligomer heights by resveratrol.
Histograms are shown of oligomer heights after 6 h of incubation of
Aβ42 either with (black bars) or without (blue bars) resveratrol
at 37 °C and a molar ratio of resveratrol-to-Aβ42 of 1:1.
(C–F) AFM images of Aβ42 with curcumin (C,E) or resveratrol
(D,F) after incubation for 6 h. Scale bars are 100 nm in (C,D) and
50 nm in (E,F).

In contrast to curcumin
and resveratrol, we also characterized
Aβ inhibitors that do not cap the oligomer height. Figure 4A and B compares the distribution of heights of
Aβ42 after 6 h of incubation with and without sulindac sulfide
and indomethacin. There is a broad range of heights from ∼1.0–5
nm with a maximum of ∼3–3.5 nm, consistent with the
average height corresponding to a high MW oligomer. Representative
AFM images are shown in Figure 4C and D. In
contrast to curcumin, sulindac sufide has previously been shown to
interact with the C-terminus of Aβ42.37

Figure 4 AFM
of Aβ42 with indomethacin and sulindac sulfide. Panels
(A) and (B) present histograms of heights observed of Aβ42 incubated
for 6 h with (black bars) or without (blue bars) indomethacin and
sulindac sulfide, respectively. In contrast to the results with curcumin
and resveratrol, these Aβ inhibitors do not cap the height of
the Aβ42 oligomers. (C–F) AFM images are shown of Aβ42
with indomethacin (C,E) or sulindac sulfide (D,F) after incubation
for 6 h. Scale bars are 100 nm in (C,D) and 50 nm in (E,F).

Capping Inhibitors Have
a Common Binding Mode to Aβ42
We next evaluated the
mechanism by which curcumin and other small
molecules bind to Aβ and modulate their oligomerization using 1H–15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy. This two-dimensional
NMR experiment yields resonances that correspond to the directly bonded 1H–15N sites in the protein. In these studies,
changes in the chemical shifts of the 1H–15N resonances of Aβ42 are expected at those sites where the
inhibitor binds to the peptide. The 1H–15N NMR spectra of 15N-labeled Aβ42 are shown in Figure 5 in the absence and presence of curcumin, resveratrol,
indomethacin, and sulindac sulfide. The spectrum of Aβ42 with
thioflavin T was acquired as a negative control (Figure S6). Thioflavin T is reported to only bind to Aβ42
fibrils and not to monomers or oligomers,54 and has no ability to inhibit fibrillization as compared to the
Aβ42 inhibitors.54 In agreement with
these observations, thioflavin T does not induce changes in the 1H–15N spectrum of Aβ42, although it
is worth noting recent reports on α-synuclein indicating that
thioflavin T can interact with the disordered monomer.55

Figure 5 Solution NMR spectroscopy of Aβ42 oligomers with
small molecule
inhibitors. 1H–15N HSQC spectra were
obtained of Aβ42 alone (black) and after coincubation (red)
with curcumin (A), resveratrol (B), indomethacin (C), and sulindac
sulfide (D). Molecular structures of the inhibitors are drawn above
their corresponding spectra. Only the central portions of the 2D NMR
spectrum are shown. Inhibitors were added in a 1:1 molar ratio of
inhibitor to Aβ42 (200 μM concentration). Relatively large
chemical shift changes are observed with the addition of curcumin
and resveratrol. In contrast, there are no appreciable changes in
chemical shift with indomethacin and sulindac sulfide (see also Table S1).

The binding of curcumin or resveratrol results in several
similar
changes in specific 1H–15N chemical shifts
of Aβ42. The largest chemical shift changes are observed in
residues in the N-terminus and middle region of the Aβ42 sequence,
including Phe4, Arg5, Gln15, Lys16, Leu17 and Phe20. The binding occurs
predominantly at the positions of polar residues that are found to
be surface exposed and accessible to exchange of their NH protons
by water (Figure S7). In contrast, the
NMR chemical shifts corresponding to the hydrophobic C-terminal residues
of Aβ42 are unchanged. The temperature dependence of oligomer
formation suggests that hydrophobic (C-terminal) interactions are
involved in monomer association, and the absence of changes in the
C-terminus upon inhibitor binding agrees with the observation that
adding inhibitor to monomeric Aβ does not prevent the formation
of low MW oligomers.

The chemical shift differences along the
peptide backbone are shown
in Figure 6 for Aβ42 in the presence
and absence of curcumin or resveratrol. These plots highlight the
similar spectral changes upon binding of these inhibitors, notably
at Arg5, Gln15, and Phe20, and the absence of chemical shift perturbations
in the C-terminus of the peptide.

Figure 6 NMR chemical shift changes in Aβ42
upon inhibitor binding.
The chemical shift differences are shown between Aβ42 alone
and Aβ42 with curcumin (orange), between Aβ42 alone and
Aβ42 with resveratrol (red) and with the other inhibitors studied.
The largest changes are observed for residues in the hydrophilic N-terminus
of the Aβ42 peptide. The RSTWESKWR peptide (gray),
which was designed to interact with Aβ42,36 shows large chemical shift changes in the N-terminus and
middle region of the peptide. Indomethacin (pink) and sulindac sulfide
(black) are γ-secretase modulators that interact with both the
C-terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein and Aβ42
to reduce neuronal toxicity.37,50,74 The NMR chemical shift changes upon the addition of these inhibitors
are minor. No effect of the KLVFF peptide inhibitor (blue) on Aβ
chemical shifts was observed. To account for the differences in the 1H and 15N chemical shift ranges, the chemical shift
perturbations were calculated as the average chemical shift change75 (Δδ) using the equation Δδ
= [{(ΔCSH)2 + (ΔCSN/5)2}/2]1/2. The chemical shifts differences are tabulated
in Tables S1–S7. The resolution
in the1H dimension is 1.38 Hz/point (∼0.002 ppm/point)
and in the 15N dimension is 8.82 Hz/point (∼0.12
ppm/point). The largest chemical shift changes in 1H (0.077
ppm) and 15N (−0.955 ppm) were observed for the
I1 inhibitor (Table S1).

The 1H–15N HSQC spectra
of the γ-secretase
modulators, indomethacin and sulindac sulfide, are presented in Figure 5C and D. In our studies, when indomethacin and sulindac
sulfide were incubated with Aβ42 at 1:1 molar ratio, no appreciable
shifts were observed in the 1H–15N HSQC
NMR spectra. Rather, there were smaller shifts distributed over the
length of the peptide (see Figure 6, Supporting Table S1). The difference between
our results and the previous studies may be related to the higher
concentration used by Richter et al.37 (3:1
molar ratio of sulindac sulfide-to-Aβ42). These inhibitors were
not able to cap the oligomers (Figure 3) as
found for resveratrol and curcumin (Figure 3) at a 1:1 molar ratio. Nevertheless, in the previous studies, sulindac
sulfide exhibits more significant binding than indomethacin, consistent
with the larger differences in the height distributions observed by
AFM (Figure 4).

Discussion
Stacking of
Low MW Aβ Oligomers
The AFM images
of two types of oligomers with similar diameters and different heights
suggest that stacking of two shorter species may form the taller oligomers.
This hypothesis is supported by two observations. First, only the
low MW form is found in the presence of specific inhibitors, consistent
with the high MW oligomers being formed from the low MW species. Second,
we show that the decrease in the number of low MW oligomers as a function
of incubation time is correlated with a gain in the number of high
MW oligomers.

The idea that the oligomers can stack was previously
proposed on the basis of ion mobility measurements using mass spectrometry.20 In this study, the dominant oligomer forms were
tetramers, hexamers, and dodecamers. The authors suggested that the
addition of a third hexamer to the dodecamer form was energetically
unfavorable and that the dodecamer is metastable and rearranges to
a nucleating species that rapidly adds monomeric Aβ to form
fibrils. In addition, this group has recently shown that the addition
of a small molecule Aβ inhibitor (Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone)
blocks the formation of Aβ42 dodecamers.56 This peptide derivative has structural similarities to
curcumin and to a designed inhibitor peptide (I1, RGTFEGKF-NH2), which was previously shown to stabilize or cap the low
MW oligomers.44 Z-Phe-Ala-diazomethylketone
and curcumin both contain two 6-membered aromatic groups separated
by 7 and 8 bonds, respectively.

More recently, ion mobility
spectrometry studies have shown the
presence of aggregates that are larger than dodecamers.57 These studies were carried out at higher concentrations
(200 μM) than that of Bowers and colleagues (30 μM).20 In a parallel study, we have shown that at 200
μM Aβ42 the low and high MW oligomers are able to laterally
associate in addition to their ability to stack (Fu et al., unpublished
results). The lateral association of oligomers into protofibrils is
directly on the pathway to fibrils through the mechanism of nucleated
conformational conversion.

Structural Implications of Aβ Oligomer
Stacking
Many of the early models of Aβ oligomers proposed
that they
were spherical micelles with a hydrophobic core formed by an unstructured
C-terminus and a hydrophilic surface formed from the polar N-terminus.46 Since these early proposals, considerable data
have revealed that both the monomers and oligomers adopt partial structure.
In the case of the Aβ monomer, NOE and chemical shift data show
there is residual β-strand structure at Leu17-Ala21 and Ile31-Val36
and turn structures at Asp7-Glu11 and Phe20-Ser26.13 Water accessibility studies show that regions in both N-
and C-termini are protected from exchange (Figure
S7) and that the C-terminus has less flexibility.58 A recent solution NMR structure of the Aβ40
monomer shows that residues from His13 to Asp23 form a 310 helix, and that both the N- and C-termini pack against the helix
due to a clustering of hydrophobic residues.59

The observation that the monomers are partially structured
is important for developing models of the low and high MW oligomers,
and understanding the transition from oligomers to fibrils. Within
the monomers comprising the Aβ oligomers, solid-state NMR studies
have shown that a β-hairpin allows intrastrand hydrogen bonding
between the β-strand structures at Leu17-Ala21 and Ile31-Val36.18 Studies incorporating intramolecular disulfide
linkages have shown that locking the β-hairpin structure in
place prevents a transition to β-sheet secondary structure formed
by interstrand hydrogen bonding between the LVFFA and the IIGLMV sequences
on adjacent peptides.60 The transition
to interstrand hydrogen bonding is essential for forming fibrils with
cross-β sheet structure.

The model that emerges is one
where the oligomers rapidly form
through hydrophobic interactions involving the C-terminus. The low
MW oligomers appear to have two distinct surfaces, where one surface
is able to mediate the association to form the high MW species. This
face-to-face interaction explains the lack of 18-mers observed in
our AFM studies as well as in the previous mass spectrometry experiments.20 One can speculate that the interacting surface
is more hydrophobic. We find that the oligomers associate strongly
with the polar mica surface in AFM. In AFM studies using graphite
that has a hydrophobic surface, more fibril-like structures are observed,
suggesting that the hydrophobic surface destabilizes the oligomers
and serves as template for fibril formation.61

As described above, in parallel with the studies described
here,
we have addressed the ability of the low and high MW oligomers to
laterally associate and form protofibrils. The lateral association
of the unstructured oligomers can be reversed until they begin to
develop the β-sheet structure characteristic of mature fibrils
(Fu et al. unpublished results). The stacking of oligomers to generate
a hydrophobic core may facilitate the rearrangement of the central
hydrophobic LVFFA sequence and C-terminal sequence to form a β-hairpin
structure that precedes fibril formation.

Inhibitors That Cap Aβ42
Oligomers Are Associated with
N-Terminal Interactions
A large number of Aβ42 inhibitors
have been described in the literature, and one of the objectives of
this study is to compare how they interact with Aβ42 monomers
and oligomers. Comparing the chemical shift changes induced in Aβ42
by our small molecule inhibitors, the largest shifts upon inhibitor
binding to Aβ42 involve residues in the N-terminal and central
portions of the peptide (Figure 6). Arg5, Ser8,
Tyr10, Gln15, Lys16, Leu17, and Phe20 were the most affected residues.
Measurements of water accessibility indicate that these residues that
interact with Aβ42 inhibitors are also solvent accessible (Figure S7). For example, Phe20 is water accessible
and undergoes a large change in chemical shift upon inhibitor binding.
In contrast, the adjacent Phe19 is inaccessible to solvent and insensitive
to inhibitor binding, arguing that Phe19 and Phe20 have opposite orientations
in the folded Aβ42 monomer. Our observations agree with recent
computational studies. Zhu et al.62 found
that regions of the Aβ42 peptide have different propensities
to bind small molecules, particularly the hydrophobic residues from
Leu17-Ala21.

The mechanism for how the N-terminus blocks or
slows oligomer stacking and fibril formation is not yet known. The
observation of large inhibitor-induced changes at Arg5 and Phe20 suggests
that Arg5 may interact directly with Phe20 of the central KLVFF sequence.
The KLVFF sequence is known to mediate fibril formation; parallel
and in-register cross-β-structure is found for the KLVFF sequence
in both in Aβ4035 and Aβ42.36 As a result, the intramolecular interaction
of the N-terminus with the KLVFF sequence may interfere with the formation
of intramolecular β-hairpin structure and intermolecular β-sheet
formation.

A peptide inhibitor corresponding to the KLVFF sequence
was one
of the earliest peptides described as an inhibitor to Aβ aggregation.63 For comparison, we also characterized the interaction
of this inhibitor with Aβ42. No effect of the KLVFF peptide
inhibitor on Aβ chemical shifts was observed (Figure S6C) or on the height of Aβ oligomers (data not
shown). In contrast, the RSTWESKWR peptide, which was
designed to interact with Aβ42,36 shows large chemical shift changes in the N-terminal and central
regions of the peptide (Figure S6B). The
peptide inhibitor RSTWESKWR is a second-generation peptide
inhibitor designed in our laboratory based on modifications of our
earlier inhibitors,36 which have been previously
shown to cap Aβ42 oligomers.44 We
found that the RSTWESKWR peptide interacts with the same
amino acids on Aβ42 as curcumin and resveratrol, namely Glu3
through Ser8, Gln15 through Leu17 and Phe20 (Figure
S6B). However, the chemical shift changes are larger upon binding
of RSTWESKWR. The similarity in binding and ability to
cap the Aβ oligomers suggests a similar mechanism of inhibition
for curcumin, resveratrol and RSTWESKWR.

Our original
designed peptide inhibitor I1 (RGTFEGKF-NH2) was
based on the C-terminal G33xxxG37 sequence
in the Aβ peptide.36 The two phenylalanines
in the I1 sequence are predicted to lie on the same side of a β-strand
and interact with the GxxxG sequence in the Aβ C-terminus. The
RSTWESKWR peptide contains two serines in the positions
of the glycines, which improve solubility, and two tryptophans at
the positions of the phenylalanines. These peptide inhibitors are
similar to the C-terminal fragments of Aβ described by Bitan
and co-workers64,65 (i.e., Aβ(30–42)
and Aβ(31–42)) that were found to be potent inhibitors
of Aβ42 oligomerization and toxicity. This group found that N-methyl amino acids at positions 3,8,9, 11 (i.e., G33,
G38, V39, I41) improved solubility and increased inhibition of toxicity.66 They proposed that the peptides disrupted the
association of both intramolecular and intermolecular β-strands.67 They found that the C-terminal tetra peptide
interacted with the N-terminus of Aβ (residues D1, R5, D7, as
well as D23).68

N-terminal interactions
have also been observed with the binding
of the myelin basic protein, a natural Aβ inhibitor in the brain.69 The myelin basic protein also has the ability
to cap the height of Aβ and block fibril formation. In studies
on an Aβ40 sequence containing the Dutch (E22Q) and Iowa (D23N)
mutations, the addition of myelin basic protein resulted in short
protofibril-like oligomers that were ∼2 nm in height (i.e.,
half the height of mature fibrils).70

In all of the Aβ inhibitors that capped the height of the
soluble oligomers, there was an observed reduction in toxicity. We
present results showing that both curcumin and resveratrol reduce
toxicity using the MTT assay in Figure S8. This supports the idea that the monomers and low MW oligomers are
less toxic than the high MW oligomers and protofibrils. These results
are in close agreement with Li et al.23 who found that stabilizing small oligomers (hydrodynamic radius
of 8–12 nm) reduced toxicity, while formation of oligomers
with a radius of 20–60 nm increased toxicity. Gazit and co-workers
also found that their inhibitors reduced the formation of toxic ∼56
kDa Aβ42 oligomers, but did not affect the formation of the
low MW Aβ42 oligomers.22

Possible Mechanisms
of Noncapping Small Molecule Inhibitors
In contrast to inhibitors
that bind to the N-terminus, the two
NSAIDs (sulindac sulfide and indomethacin), which were previously
found to bind to Aβ42, were not effective in capping the low
MW oligomers. For both of these inhibitors, the 1H–15N HSQC spectra revealed only small chemical shift changes
across the length of the Aβ42 sequence in our comparative study
(Figure 6, Table S1), suggesting very weak interactions, at least with the Aβ
monomer.

One possibility is that these molecules primarily interact
with the high MW Aβ oligomers. In the discussion above, we have
suggested that formation of the high MW oligomers is through stacking
of the hydrophobic surface of low MW oligomers. This hydrophobic core
(composed of the C-terminal Aβ residues) may serve as the binding
site for this second class of Aβ inhibitor.

A second possibility
is that these inhibitors do not interact with
oligomers but rather interact with Aβ42 protofibrils or fibrils.
Sulindac sulfide, which was reported to interact with the C-terminus
of Aβ42, was proposed to bind to the β-sheet structure
within Aβ fibrils.37 In two similar
studies, binding of inhibitors to the hydrophobic C-terminus of Aβ
led to increased fibril formation. In the first study, Wanker and
colleagues recently found that an orcein-related small molecule inhibitor
(O4) interacts with the C-terminus and inhibits Aβ42 toxicity
by increasing the rate of protofibril formation.71 They modeled the interaction of this inhibitor with the
surface of Aβ fibrils, and suggested that these inhibitors lower
the concentration of toxic oligomers by increasing the rate of conversion
of high MW oligomers into fibrils.71 Connors
et al.72 found that the binding of tranilast
to residues in the hydrophobic C-terminal region of Aβ monomers
led to increased fibril formation. They suggested that binding of
the inhibitor within a hydrophobic pocket formed by the C-terminal
residues causes a shift to Aβ species capable of seed formation
and fibril elongation.

Summary
In this study, we compare
the interaction of two natural products
(curcumin and resveratrol) and two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (sulindac sulfide and indomethacin) with Aβ42 monomers
and oligomers. We first show that monomeric Aβ42 forms low MW
oligomers with heights (measured by AFM) of ∼1.0–2.5
nm, and suggest that these oligomers stack to form the high MW oligomers
with heights of 3–5 nm. Our studies show that the location
of inhibitor binding influences their ability to block the formation
of the high MW oligomers. We observe a correlation between N-terminal
binding of three different inhibitors (curcumin, resveratrol, and
RSTWESKWR) and capping of the low MW oligomers. In contrast,
the inhibitors that have nonspecific binding across the Aβ sequence
(indomethacin and sulindac sulfide) do not cap oligomers and function
by a different mechanism of inhibition. These compounds may be part
of a larger set of small molecules that bind to Aβ fibrils and
possibly shift the equilibrium from toxic high MW oligomers and protofibrils.73 Further studies on these inhibitors that only
very weakly bind to Aβ will be needed to understand their mechanism
of inhibition.
