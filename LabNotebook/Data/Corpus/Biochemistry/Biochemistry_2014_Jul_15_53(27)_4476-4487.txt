Exposure
to organophosphorous
(OP) compounds in the form of pesticides or nerve agents is a significant
public health concern, and pesticide exposure is one of the most common
causes of poisoning throughout the world. OP nerve agents and pesticides inhibit human acetylcholinesterase
(hAChE) in the central nervous system to disrupt neurotransmission.
This can result in brain damage, loss of muscle control, or death. The current standard of treatment for nerve agent
exposure
involves concomitant administration of a cholinesterase (ChE) reactivator
[e.g., an oxime, 2-pralidoxime (2-PAM)], a muscarinic receptor antagonist
(atropine), and an anticonvulsant (diazepam). Even though this regime decreases mortality, the efficacy
is limited because 2-PAM does not prevent toxicity associated with
nerve agent exposure to the brain because 2-PAM does not cross the
blood–brain barrier. Catalytic bioscavenger therapy, an attractive
alternative prophylactic approach to nerve agent detoxication, involves
administration of a detoxication enzyme that binds and/or hydrolyzes
nerve agents before they reach hAChE in the brain. In principle, administration
of peripheral bioscavengers could prevent irreversible brain damage.
Human BChE (hBChE) is an ideal candidate enzyme for this type of therapy.
hBChE is abundant in blood, does not require any cofactors, and is
soluble and highly functional at the
pH of plasma. Wild-type (WT) hBChE has been used with some success
as a nerve agent detoxication scavenger in guinea pigs. However, the feasibility of the use of exogenously
administered
hBChE as a broad-scale peripheral blocker of OP toxicity is limited
because the reaction of hBChE with a nerve agent is stoichiometric
and irreversible and thus requires a large amount of highly pure hBChE
for detoxication purposes. hBChE variants identified by rational design
(i.e., hBChE G117H and E197Q) act as only low-level catalytic bioscavengers
because of the decreased affinity of G117H and E197Q hBChE for nerve
agents. Thus, elaboration of hBChE variants
that show
greater
nerve agent resistance (i.e., variants that do not react with nerve
agents but are functionally active cholinesterases)
and/or nerve agent hydrolytic functional activity represents an unmet
medical need to counter nerve agent exposure.

Previous studies
reported the results of rationally designed hBChE
variants for investigating the interaction between nerve agents and
hBChE., Several hBChE variants were reported to
be resistant to nerve agents.− For example, hBChE variant G117H
increased the rate of hydrolytic
dephosphonylation of nerve agent–hBChE covalent adducts and
functioned as a catalytic bioscavenger by converting reactive nerve
agents to relatively inert products through a net hydrolysis reaction. An E197Q hBChE variant decreased the rate of
enzyme
aging, a process whereby nerve agent–enzyme adducts lose one
or more of their alkyl moieties by spontaneous hydrolysis and are
thereby rendered much less prone to reactivation. Site-directed mutagenesis
studies of hBChE identified several residues that were important for
nerve agent-induced hBChE aging, including D70 and W82. Also, hAChE residues W86, Y133, E202, F338, and
E450
have been reported to be involved in the hAChE aging process. The molecular basis for efficient human ChE nerve
agent
hydrolytic functional activity is presumably attributed to a number
of residues in the primary sequence of the protein that determine
the rates of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, and aging.,

Previously, we described a robust directed molecular evolution
approach to identifying hBChE residues that conferred resistance to
enzymatic inhibition by nerve agent model compounds. There are many potential mechanisms for hBChE resistance
to nerve agent model compounds, including but not limited to hydrolysis,
rapid reactivation, resistance to aging, or decreased binding affinity.
Because use of authentic nerve agents is strictly regulated, nerve
agent model compounds that have chemical and functional properties
similar to those of authentic nerve agents were
used. These nerve agent model compounds
were used in molecular evolution
studies to identify hBChE variants. hBChE resistance to nerve agent
model compounds was determined on the basis of kinetic studies to
identify OP-resistant variants. To facilitate
kinetic studies, a previously described
monomeric hBChE with a C-terminal histidine tag was used to permit
protein expression, purification, and kinetics of hBChE variants. Monomeric hBChE showed kinetic parameters virtually
identical to those of WT tetrameric
hBChE. The molecular evolution method
identified the previously described
hBChE G117H variant that showed nerve agent resistance as well as
novel variants G117N, G117R, E197C, and L125V that showed nerve agent
model compound resistance.

Herein,
we describe the use of a molecular evolution method to
develop novel hBChE variants with increased resistance to nerve agent
model compounds. The method was flexible enough to pick up variants
that worked via any of the possible resistance mechanisms described
above. Recombinant protein expression
of the hBChE variants
identified permitted determination of the kinetics using stereochemically
defined nerve agent model compounds of soman (GD), sarin (GB), and
cyclosarin (GF). Novel hBChE variants with increased resistance to
nerve agent model compounds that retained robust intrinsic catalytic
efficiency were identified. On the basis of the unusual location of
the amino acid variants within the protein, molecular dynamics simulations
were undertaken and revealed insights into the mechanism by which
these structural changes conferred nerve agent model compound resistance.

Materials
and Methods
Biological and Chemical Reagents
Butyrylthiocholine
(BTC) iodine and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Goat anti-rabbit
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme and
Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminscent substrate were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Buffers and solvents were
purchased from VWR (West Chester, PA) at the highest purity commercially
available. Molecular biology reagents were purchased from Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise specified. Highly purified native
hBChE, anti-hBChE polyclonal antibodies, echothiophate (ETP) iodide
[2-(dithoxyphosphinyl)thio-N,N,N-trimethylethanaminium
iodide], and the wild-type hBChE cDNA construct in pRC/CMV encoding
the full-length wild-type hBChE G117H single mutant were generously
provided by O. Lockridge (University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha,
NE). Nerve agent model compounds (S)-2-[isopropoxy(methyl)phosphorylthio]-N,N-dimethylethanammonium chloride (SPGB3N), (SP)-2-[3,3-dimethylbutan-2-oxy(methyl)phosphorylthio]-N,N-dimethylethanammonium chloride (SPGD3N), and (S)-2-[cyclohexyloxy(methyl)phosphorylthio]-N,N-dimethylethanammonium chloride (SPGF3N) were prepared according to a previously
published procedure.,, The nerve agent model compounds are toxic and must be handled with
extreme care. Chemical waste containing nerve agent model compounds
or other OPs were degraded by hydrolysis with overnight incubation
with 2.5 M NaOH and 10% ethanol before being disposed.

hBChE Plasmid
Construction and Adenovirus Production
Wild-type (WT) hBChE
with an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal
histidine tag (amino acids 1–540,
W541ΔH6) was cloned into the pENTR1a
entry vector (Life Technologies) at the KpnI and XhoI
restriction sites as described previously. The Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H mutations were introduced into
a hBChE W541ΔH6 pENTR1a construct by site-directed
mutagenesis using
mutagenic primer sequences listed in Table S1 of the . Following confirmation by DNA sequencing,
hBChE variants were recombined into the pAD destination vector (Life
Technologies). Adenovirus was generated
by transfecting the
hBChE W541ΔH6 pAD construct into HEK-293A cells using
the ViraPower
Adenoviral Expression System (Life Technologies). Subsequent viral
amplification in HEK-293A cells yielded recombinant adenoviral stocks
with titers ranging from 3.2 × 107 to 2.1 × 109 plaque-forming units/mL.

hBChE Protein Expression
and Purification
CHO-cTA-CAR
cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) grown in suspension were infected with
recombinant adenovirus at an MOI of 30 for 72 h. Medium supernatants
were then clarified for purification by centrifugation (400g for 2.5 min). WT and variant hBChE were purified
from clarified supernatants by nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) with running buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 500 mM
NaCl] and elution buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, and 400
mM imidazole]. Imidazole of the elution buffer was removed by dialysis.
To remove the imidazole in the elution buffer, highly purified hBChE
variant proteins were dialyzed with 2 L (one buffer exchange) of phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) [50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl].

Quantification of WT hBChE and hBChE Variants by Western Blotting
Full-length tetrameric WT hBChE was used as a standard for the
determination of protein concentrations of hBChE variants. Serial
dilutions of WT standard hBChE (68 units/mL) were prepared and afforded
final concentrations of 1–10 units/mL. Both the WT hBChE standard
curve and hBChE variant samples were resolved on the same gel by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then
transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis included sequential
steps of blocking [PBS and Tween-20 (0.01%) (PBST) with 5% nonfat
dry milk (NFDM), 1 h, 25 °C], primary antibody (i.e., rabbit
anti-hBChE was generously provided by O. Lockridge, 1:1000 in a PBST/NFDM
mixture, 16 h, 4 °C), secondary antibody [i.e., goat α-rabbit
HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), 1:5000 in a PBST/NFDM
mixture, 1 h, 4 °C], and detection with SuperSignal West Pico
chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were
scanned to a file, and band densitometry analysis was conducted using
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Linear regression
analysis of WT hBChE afforded a best-fit line equation. Variant hBChE
protein concentrations were determined using the density of the variant
bands and the best-fit line equation from the WT hBChE standard curve
(data not shown).

Substrate-Dependent Hydrolysis of Butyrylthiocholine
Iodide
(BTC) by hBChE Variants
hBChE functional activity was continuously
measured spectrophotometrically (Tecan SpectraFluorPLUS microplate
reader, Tecan Group Ltd.) with an Ellman assay. Briefly, BTC (Fluka, St. Louis, MO) was used as a substrate
for WT and hBChE variants over a final concentration range of 0.01–100
mM. Incubations were conducted in PBS at 25 °C in the presence
of 0.4 mM DTNB (Sigma-Aldrich). A highly purified hBChE enzyme (i.e.,
WT, Y332S, D340H, Y332S/D340H, or G117H) (3.5 × 10–3 IU) was added to initiate the incubation, and hydrolysis was
continuously monitored by recording the absorbance at 405 nm. The
functional activity was calculated from the molar extinction coefficient
of 13600 M–1 cm–1. Observed rates of hydrolysis were fit to eq , which describes
the activation of the enzyme (when b &gt; 1) at relatively
high BTC concentrations from the binding of the substrate to a secondary
binding sitethat afforded best-fit
kinetic values and
relevant standard errors. For the purpose of analysis, b was fixed at 1.7 and Kss was constrained
to be greater than zero.

Resistance
to Nerve Agent Model Compound Inhibition by hBChE
Variants
hBChE variant activities were measured as discussed
above with the following modifications. Butyrylthiocholine iodide
(BTC) was used as a substrate for hBChE variants at a final concentration
of 1 mM. Incubations were conducted in PBS at 25 °C in the presence
of 0.2 mM DTNB. The functional activity was monitored and calculated
as discussed above. Nerve agent model compounds [SPGD3N (soman model), SPGB3N
(sarin model), and SPGF3N (cyclosarin
model)] were used as freshly prepared solutions in DMSO. The final concentration of cosolvent in the
inhibition mixtures was &lt;5%. Control experiments showed no effect
of &lt;5% solvent on hBChE enzyme activity for BTC hydrolysis in the
incubation
(i.e., BChE in PBS at 25 °C in the presence of &lt;5% DMSO).
Inhibition was initiated by addition of an aliquot of the nerve agent
model compound solution to 3.6 × 10–3 IU of
highly purified hBChE. The mixtures were incubated at
25 °C, and at defined times, an aliquot of the reaction mixture
was taken to determine the residual ChE activity at 25 °C as
described above. For kinetic studies, five to seven concentrations
of nerve agent model compound were used and at least
four time points were taken for each concentration [for SPGB3N, WT (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 μM), Y332S, D340H,
and Y332S/D340H
(5, 6.67, 8, 10, and 20 μM), and G117H (500, 750, 900, 1000,
and 1500 μM); for SPGD3N, WT (1,
2, 5, 8, and 10 μM), Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H (1, 1.33,
2, 5, and 10 μM), and G117H (500, 625, 750, and 1000 μM);
for SPGF3N, WT (0.01,
0.0133, 0.02, 0.1, and 10 μM) and Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H
(500, 555, 750, 1000, and 2000 μM)]. Plots of the logarithm
of the residual initial velocity versus incubation time afforded kapp (the apparent first-order rate constant
for inhibition at a given concentration of nerve agent model compound).
A replot of kapp versus the concentration
of the nerve agent model compound afforded inhibition constant values
(ki). For hyperbolic replots, nonlinear
curve fitting to the equation kapp = k2[NA]/(KD + [NA])
(NA, nerve agent model compound) afforded both phosphorylation or
phosphonylation rate constants (k2) and
equilibrium dissociation constants (KD)., Bimolecular rate constants (ki) were
calculated from the k2/KD ratio. For linear replots, bimolecular rate constant
(ki) values were determined by linear
regression analyses of the slope.

Data Analysis
Data analyses, including statistical
comparisons via a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
a Dunnett’s multiple-comparison test, were conducted using
GraphPad Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA).

Docking
Studies of Nerve Agent Model Compounds with hBChE Variants
Docking simulations of hBChE with nerve agent model compounds were
conducted using AutoDock Vina. The structure
of hBChE used for docking studies was
taken from the crystal structure of hBChE [Protein Data Bank (PDB)
entry 1P0I] after removal of the ligands of crystallization
[i.e., butanoic acid, l-fucose, glycerol, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, and sulfate], water, and salts with
a PyMol Molecular Graphics System (version 1.4.1, Schrödinger,
LLC, San Diego, CA). The Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H variants were
also created in PyMol using the mutagenesis function. Ligand and protein
docking parameters were assigned using an AutoDock Tools program.
The search space encompassed the binding gorge and surrounding residues
(including D340) with a volume of 31500 Å3. Nerve
agent model compounds were designated as conformationally
flexible in the docking simulations. Dockings used an exhaustiveness
setting of 64 and were repeated to confirm the preferred binding mode
in independent simulations.

Determination of the Modeling Parameters
for the Nerve Agent
Model Compound SPGB3N
The parameters
for the topology of the SPGB3N ligand
were obtained using the Automated Topology Builder (ATB)., The validity of the charge distribution was confirmed by manually
checking the model against density functional theory (DFT) charge
distribution calculated using NWChem version 6.1.1.− Minor adjustments
were made to the charge groups to
better match the conventions used in the GROMACS package (http://www.gromacs.org).

Molecular Dynamics (MD) Studies of hBChE Variants
Molecular
dynamics simulations were conducted using GROMACS version 4.6.3 and
the Gromos53a6 force field, under periodic boundary
conditions. The starting topology was built using the coordinates
of the docked structure of hBChE (PDB entry 1P0I). A dodecahedral
box was created around the protein 1.0 nm from the edge of the protein
and filled with extended simple point charge water molecules. Sodium
and chloride ions were added to produce an electroneutral solution
at a final concentration of 0.15 M NaCl. The energy was minimized
using a steepest gradient method to remove any close contacts before
the system was subjected to a two-phase position-restrained MD equilibration
procedure. The system was first allowed to evolve for 100 ps in a
canonical NVT (N is the number of
particles, V the system volume, and T the temperature) ensemble at 25 °C before pressure coupling
was switched on and the system was equilibrated for an additional
100 ps in the NPT (P is the system
pressure)
ensemble at 1.0
bar. The production runs were conducted in an NPT ensemble at 25 °C and 1.0 bar for 50 ns with a step size of
2 fs. All bond lengths were constrained to their equilibrium values
by using the LINCS algorithm. The neighbor list for the calculation
of nonbonded interactions was updated every five time steps with a
cutoff of
1.0 nm. A twin range cutoff of 1.0 nm was used for both Coulomb and
Lennard-Jones interactions. The system was split into two groups,
“Protein” and “Non-Protein”, which were
coupled separately to a temperature bath using the V-rescale algorithm with a time constant of 0.1 ps while the pressure
coupling was conducted using an isotropic Parrinello–Rahman
barostat with a time constant
of 2.0 ps., The PyMol Molecular Graphics
System, version 1.4.1 (Schrödinger,
LLC), was used to create structural models of the hBChE MD analysis.

Results
Identification of Nerve Agent Model Compound-Resistant hBChE
Variants
To identify hBChE variants that showed resistance
to inhibition of functional activity by nerve agent model compounds,
we implemented a directed molecular evolution approach in a mammalian
cell-based functional screen. Because work with actual nerve agents is precluded in
most academic laboratories, we developed a series of nerve agent model
compounds (Figure ) that were used to identify
variants of hBChE that
were resistant to inhibition by these compounds. Initially, we designed and constructed six mutagenesis
libraries that together encompassed structurally relevant regions
of the active site areas and the peripheral anionic binding site (PAS)
of hBChE. hBChE libraries were made by
introduction of mutations
through PCR using doped oligonucleotides, subcloning PCR library fragments
into the shuttle vector pENTR1A, transfer of the mutation library
from pENTR1A to an adenoviral expression vector (pAD) through recombination,
and then packaging of the mutation libraries in pAD in recombinant
AD particles through transfection as described previously. The sequence diversity of the hBChE libraries
was analyzed
by DNA sequencing. Sequencing of 50 representative library clones
showed that the mutation rate was
3.8% in nucleotides and 1.8% in amino acids. One particular library of variants that encompassed
residues 325–344 of hBChE was investigated for functional activity
to identify hBChE
variants that showed decreased rates of inhibition of nerve agent
model compounds. Results of initial solid
phase assays of the library
were confirmed by liquid phase assays of hBChE functional activity. In a solid phase screen, bright yellow gel plugs
were
cored out as positive signals from an Ellman assay (i.e., in the presence
of SPGD3N for 2–6 h, followed by
incubation with 1 mM BTC and 1 mM DTNB). Hydrolysis
of DTNB generated the yellow 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate product, and candidate
viral particles were identified and isolated. In confirmatory liquid
phase hBChE functional assays, highly purified virus particles isolated
from the yellow gel plugs were scaled up in sufficient quantity for
hBChE functional assays. Briefly, virus particles were used to infect
cells, and the expressed hBChE variants were examined for functional
activity using a modified Ellman assay. Viral DNA encoding nerve agent model compound-resistant
hBChE variants was sequenced to identify sites where mutagenesis was
present. Using this approach, we identified hBChE variants Y332S,
D340H, and Y332S/D340H from a hBChE library that encompassed residues
325–344 (Figure S5 of the ). The variants were resistant to inhibition
by nerve agent model compounds of soman (i.e., SPGD3N), sarin (i.e., SPGB3N), and
cyclosarin (i.e., SPGF3N) (Figure ).

Characterization of WT
and Variant hBChE Using Butyrylthiocholine
(BTC) as a Substrate
The steady-state kinetic parameters
for BTC hydrolysis in the presence of WT hBChE and hBChE variants
Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H were determined for each enzyme using
an Ellman assay. The previously reported
hBChE variant G117H was included
for comparison, and the kinetic parameters
are listed in Table . In this study, to facilitate
hBChE protein purification, we used C-terminal histidine-tagged N-truncated
hBChE that we have previously shown to be kinetically indistinguishable
from full-length tetrameric WT hBChE. Kinetic data were fit to the Webb equation (eq ) that described an initial hyperbolic substrate
dependence for hydrolysis with a Michaelis constant (KM) followed by kinetic activation (when b &gt; 1) upon saturation of the peripheral anionic site (PAS) with
an
apparent dissociation constant of Kss.
Formation of the product was linearly dependent on WT and variant
hBChEs. Product formation was also linearly dependent on BTC (from
5 μM to 50 mM) for the WT and variant hBChEs examined. For the
hBChE
enzymes examined, substrate-dependent activation was readily apparent
as shown by the kinetic parameters listed in Table . On the basis of these observations, WT hBChE had a lower KM value for BTC relative to those of the hBChE
variants Y332S (1.1-fold greater), D340H (1.9-fold greater), Y332S/D340H
(5.7-fold greater), and G117H (2.4-fold greater). Compared to the KM value for WT hBChE, hBChE variant Y332S/D340H
showed a statistically significantly greater KM (p &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically
significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) between WT and
variant hBChEs for the dissociation constant of BTC at the peripheral
binding site (Kss) when the activation
factor b was set to 1.7 as previously described (Table ). However, the BTC
hydrolysis constant (kcat) for WT hBChE
was significantly lower than those of
hBChE variants Y332S (2.2-fold greater; p &gt; 0.05)
and Y332S/D340H (2.6-fold greater; p &gt; 0.05) but
not those for the D340H (0.64-fold greater; p &gt;
0.05)
and G117H (0.58-fold greater; p &gt; 0.05). Compared
with those of WT hBChE and the previously characterized hBChE G117H
variant, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of hBChE variants Y332S, D340H,
and Y332S/D340H showed mixed results. The Y332S hBChE variant showed
the highest catalytic efficiency, greater than those of both WT and
G117H BChE (1.7- and 11-fold greater, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). The D340H hBChE variant showed a catalytic efficiency
lower than that of WT (2.9-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05).
However, the catalytic efficiency of D340H was still greater than
that of G117H hBChE (2.3-fold greater; p &lt; 0.05).
The double variant Y332S/D340H hBChE apparently combined the effects
of both single mutations and afforded a catalytic efficiency that
was lower than that of WT (2.2-fold lower; p &lt;
0.05) yet greater than that of G117H (3.0-fold greater; p &lt; 0.05).

Evaluation of WT and Variant hBChEs for Resistance
to Inhibition
by SPGB3N, SPGF3N, and SPGD3N
In this work,
enzyme inhibition studies with WT or variant hBChEs used nerve agent
model compounds previously synthesized and characterized. These nerve agent model compounds have a 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethanethiol leaving group
that in its protonated state (i.e., ammonium) mimics a thiocholine
leaving group. The propensity of the leaving group in these nerve
agent model compounds differs from those of highly reactive leaving
groups of authentic agents, but otherwise, the model compounds recapitulate
the properties of authentic agents. For example, the protein adduct
formed through phosphonylation of S198 by the nerve agent model compounds
is indistinguishable from the adduct formed with authentic nerve agents.− The nerve agent model compounds described herein possess
a center of chirality (i.e., R and S isomers at phosphorus) and stereoselectively inhibited ChEs with
a stereoselectivity similar
to that of the real agents. Other advantages
of the nerve agent model compounds
stem from their lack of volatility, water solubility, and increased
chemical stability. The nerve agent model compounds described herein
are also much less toxic than the authentic agents. For this study,
we prepared SP enantiomers of nerve agent
models of sarin (GB), cyclosarin (GF), and soman (GD) (Figure ). The SP enantiomers of the
nerve agent model compounds were approximately 50-fold more potent
with respect to inhibition of hBChE hydrolysis of BTC than their corresponding RP enantiomers. To
simplify the kinetics and conduct studies with the
most biologically relevant nerve agent model compound, the SP enantiomers were used.

The kinetic parameters
of phosphonylation by nerve agent model compounds SPGD3N, SPGB3N, and SPGF3N were examined in the presence of WT or
variant hBChEs at concentrations from 1 to 10 μM for 60 min.
After a 60 min preincubation, each enzyme/inhibitor mixture was diluted
with an assay mixture containing BTC in PBS
(pH 7.5). The remaining hBChE hydrolysis activity was measured using
a modified Ellman assay. A plot of the
percent remaining hBChE functional activity
versus time gave a linear response, and the slopes of these plots
afforded apparent rate constants (kapp values) (Figures S1–S3 of the ). The kapp for inhibition
was obtained from linear regression analysis of the semilogarithmic
plots of hBChE activity versus incubation time. Replots of kapp versus the
concentration of the nerve agent model compound gave linear correlations
and allowed calculation of k2 and KD based on nonlinear curve fitting analysis (Figures S1–S3 of the ). The inhibition
constants (ki) for WT and variants were
then calculated from k2/KD5 and are listed in Table .

Compared to those of WT hBChE,
hBChE variants
Y332S and D340H had longer half-lives of inhibition and lower rates
of inhibition for the nerve agent model compounds tested (Table ). Compared to that of WT hBChE, the
half-lives of inhibition (t1/2) of hBChE
variants Y332S and D340H by
the nerve agent model compounds were longer (i.e., 5.65- and 4.05-fold
longer, respectively, for SPGD3N, 2.5-
and 1.3-fold longer, respectively, for SPGB3N, and was 2- and 2.3-fold longer, respectively, for SPGF3N). However, the differences in half-lives between
WT and variant hBChEs did not reach a statistically significant difference
(p &lt; 0.05) (Table ). Compared
to that of WT hBChE, Y332S and D340H hBChE variants showed statistically
significantly lower k2 values for SPGD3N (2.4- and 2.9-fold lower, respectively; p &lt; 0.05), SPGB3N (2.3- and
2.4-fold lower, respectively; p &lt; 0.05), and SPGF3N (5.8- and 4.6-fold lower, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) (Table ). Compared
to that of WT hBChE, hBChE variants Y332S and D340H showed significantly
greater KD values for SPGB3N (6.1- and 2.3-fold greater, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) but not SPGD3N
(5.7- and 4.1-fold greater, respectively) and SPGF3N (2.0- and 2.3-fold greater, respectively) (Table ). Compared to that of WT hBChE, the Y332S and D340H
hBChE variants also showed significantly lower ki values for SPGD3N (5.5- and 2.8-fold
lower, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) and SPGB3N (14- and 4.7-fold lower, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) but not SPGF3N (2.9- and
2.2-fold lower, respectively) (Table ). The
results suggested that single variants of hBChE (i.e., Y332S and D340H)
conferred considerable resistance to inhibition with nerve agent model
compounds.

The Y332S/D340H hBChE variant had a half-life for
inhibition by
the nerve agent model compounds significantly longer than those of
WT hBChE [SPGD3N (9.7-fold longer; p &lt; 0.05), SPGB3N (15-fold
longer; p &lt; 0.05), and SPGF3N (2-fold longer; p &lt; 0.05)]. Compared
to that of WT hBChE, the Y332/D340H variant showed significantly lower k2 rate constants for inhibition by SPGD3N (i.e., 19-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05)
and SPGB3N (5.3-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05) but not by SPGF3N (i.e.,
1.2-fold lower). Similar to those of the single hBChE variants Y332S
and D340H, the affinity (KD) of the Y332S/D340H
hBChE double mutant was significantly lower than that of WT hBChE
[i.e., 4.7-fold lower for SPGD3N (p &lt; 0.05), 16-fold lower for SPGB3N (p &lt; 0.05), or 8-fold lower for SPGF3N (p &lt; 0.05)]. Relative
to that of WT hBChE, slower rates of inhibition (ki) of Y332S/D340H hBChE by SPGD3N (4-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05), SPGB3N (70-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05). and SPGF3N (6.6-fold lower; p &lt;
0.05) were observed. Compared to Y332S/D340H, the G117H hBChE variant
was the most resistant to nerve agent model compound inhibition and
had the lowest inhibition rate constant for SPGD3N (649-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05) and SPGB3N (26-fold lower; p &lt;
0.05). These data are consistent with previously published results. However, the half-life (t1/2) for hBChE inhibition by nerve agent model
compounds SPGB3N, SPGD3N, and SPGF3N could not be
calculated for G117H hBChE because hydrolysis activity decreased by
only &lt;15% during the assay. Overall, the results showed that the
Y332S/D340H variant conferred significantly greater resistance to
inhibition by nerve agent model compounds than WT hBChE as well as
the Y332S and D340H single-variant hBChEs. We also compared the resistance
of WT hBChE and hBChE Y332S/D340H variants to inhibition by ecothiophate
iodide (ETP). The hBChE Y332S/D340H variant showed a rate of inhibition
(ki) (29-fold lower; p &lt; 0.05) lower than that of WT hBChE. The resistance of hBChE
Y332S/D340H to inhibition by the nerve agent model compounds was confirmed
by the resistance to ETP. The Y332S/D340H hBChE variant showed a resistance
to SPGB3N greater than that of ETP (2.4-fold
greater; p &lt; 0.05).

Studies of Docking of SPGB3N to
WT, Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H hBChE Variants
To investigate
the binding of nerve agent model compounds to hBChE, we docked the SPGB3N nerve agent model compound to the crystal
structure of WT hBChE and Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H hBChE variants.
For WT hBChE, energy-minimized binding studies placed SPGB3N in the active site of the enzyme with the phosphorus
of the nerve agent model compound 4.0 Å from the oxygen atom
of the active site serine [i.e., S198 (Figure )]. The large 2-(N,N-dimethylammonium)ethyl
substituent of SPGB3N extended into the
relatively large pocket proximal to W82 of
hBChE that is the choline binding site. A distance of 4.2 Å between
the ammonium nitrogen atom of the nerve agent model compound
and the nearest aromatic carbon suggested the presence of stabilizing
cation−π interactions at W82. The 2-propyl substituent
of SPGB3N that mimicked the sarin side
chain was directed to the acyl binding pocket. The preference for
docking the relatively large 2-(N,N-dimethylammonium)ethyl and 2-propyl substituents to these sites
forced the methyl and oxo substituents of the SPGB3N phosphonate to be oriented toward the opening of the
gorge. Docking the SPGB3N model compound
in the active site of WT hBChE and the Y332S, D340H and Y332S/D340H
variants resulted in almost no change in the preferred binding mode
of the ligand. The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of SPGB3N docked to either WT hBChE or the Y332S/D340H variant
was 0.09 Å. The ligand structures were overlaid (i.e., depicted
in Figure ), which showed
the similarity of the poses that were docked. Together, the docking
results showed that SPGB3N adopted a binding
mode that was consistent with other choline-containing substrates
of hBChE, although the distance between the active site serine and
the nerve agent phosphorus atom suggested that this precomplex was
not reactant-like for the phosphonylation reaction. As expected
from docking to static proteins, hBChE variant residues on the periphery
of the protein such as D340H, or even Y332S, had a minimal effect
on the binding orientation of the ligand in the active site.

Molecular Dynamics Structural Modeling of WT, Y332S, D340H,
and Y332S/D340H hBChE Variants
As described above, studies
of docking of SPGB3N to WT or variant
hBChE showed a very similar binding mode. The distance between variant
residues Y332 and D340 and the active site S198 was 17 Å for
the S198–Y332
pair and 25 Å for the S198–D340 pair in the crystal structure
of hBChE (PDB entry 1P0I). Docking studies predicted a very
similar mode of binding of the nerve
agent SPGB3N to all variants of hBChE
examined, suggesting that the geometry of the binding site was not
directly affected by these relatively distal mutations. Therefore,
a MD approach was undertaken to investigate the effect of the Y332S,
D340H, and Y332S/D340H hBChE variants on the overall structure of
hBChE and the possible mechanism by which resistance to nerve agent
model compounds was conferred. The WT and three hBChE variants (D340H,
Y332S, and D340H/Y332S) were simulated, each of them with and without SPGB3N docked in their active sites. This resulted
in a total of eight 50 ns trajectories. After the initial relaxation
over the first few nanoseconds, the global protein size of gyration
values remained stable and confirmed that the protein structures examined
were stable under the simulation conditions and that its global (i.e.,
globular) form was retained. However, evaluation of the root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) of the protein backbone atoms (C, CA, and N) among
variants and WT hBChE showed marked differences (Figure ). Comparison of WT hBChE to the WT hBChE–SPGB3N complex showed lower average rmsd values in the
complex. This suggested that for the WT enzyme, the ligand stabilized
the conformation that was observed in the crystal structure (Figure A,B). The Y332S hBChE variant also showed a lower
average rmsd for protein backbone atoms when bound to SPGB3N (Figure A). In contrast,
for D340H and D340H/Y332S hBChE variants, this trend was reversed
and lower rmsd values were observed for the unbound structures than
for the WT complex (i.e., WT, 3.5 Å; WT with SPGB3N, 2.3 Å; Y332S, 3.0 Å; Y332S with SPGB3N, 2.3 Å; D340H, 2.5 Å; D340H
with SPGB3N, 3.3 Å; Y332S/D340H,
2.6 Å; Y332S/D340H with SPGB3N, 3.7
Å)
(Figure A,B). Thus, D340H and Y332S/D340H
hBChE variants showed a difference in the dynamics and possibly substrate
recognition of these variants compared to those of WT or Y332S hBChE
variants. The Y332S/D340H hBChE–SPGB3N complex showed even greater structural deviation than WT hBChE
in the absence of SPGB3N, reaching a 4
Å
average backbone rmsd for the variant complex after 50 ns. However,
in the absence of SPGB3N, the Y332S/D340H
hBChE variant showed a backbone rmsd similar to that of the WT hBChE
complex (Figure B).

WT and hBChE variants. MD simulations were used to compare the starting
structure as a function of time for WT and Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H
hBChE variants in the absence (black line) and presence (red line)
of SPGB3N. (B) Plot of rmsd vs time of
all the backbone atoms (C, CA, and N) from the starting structure

(dotted lines) of SPGB3N bound to the
active site.

An rmsd analysis of hBChE
MDs was conducted on
selected regions of hBChE to further help define a mechanism of resistance
among Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H hBChE variants to inhibition by
nerve agent model compounds. Recent studies indicated that several
residues in the vicinity of the BChE active site form a door that
has a major modulatory effect on the hBChE activity and its substrate
selectivity. This “main door”
consists of residues
V288, Q119, L286, N68, and A277 on one side and residues A328, P329,
and Y332 on the other side of the binding gorge of hBChE. We investigated the aperture of the “main
door”
in novel hBChE variants by computing the time-averaged distances between
all 15 pairs of residues on opposite sides of the “main door”
(Figure ). In most cases, the values varied
synchronously and indicated that the sides of the “main door”
acted mostly as rigid surfaces (Figure S4 of the ). The aperture, the average of the
15 distances, was therefore used as a single metric for the extent
of the “main door” opening and closing. The time-averaged
aperture gave a value for the WT hBChE that was 15.0 Å for the
unbound enzyme that decreased to 12.9 Å after it formed a complex
with SPGB3N
(Table ). In contrast, the D340H hBChE variant
aperture showed essentially
the opposite trend. For D340H, in the absence of the ligand, the distance
was determined to be 14.0 Å, but in the presence of a ligand,
the distance increased to 15.1 Å (Table ). This suggested that the presence
of SPGB3N in the active site prevented
the door from closing as observed for WT hBChE. Analysis of the Y332S
hBChE variant indicated that the “main door” of Y332S
in the presence of ligand had a distance similar to that of the WT
hBChE “main door” without a ligand (i.e., 15.0 Å
for unbound WT and 14.7 Å for SPGB3N-bound
Y332S) (Table ). However, in the absence of
ligand, the Y332S
“main door” aperture was only 12.8 Å (Table ). The largest deviation from that
of WT hBChE was observed for the double mutant, Y332S/D340H hBChE,
that had a 16.3 Å “main door” aperture in the presence
of SPGB3N (Table ). In the absence
of SPGB3N, the “main door”
of the Y332S/D340H variant value remained equally high (15.8 Å
aperture). Taken together, both the Y332S and D340H hBChE variants
introduced marked changes to the dynamics of the “main door”
in the presence or absence of a ligand, and the effect of the Y332S/D340H
hBChE amino acid variant on structural distortions from WT hBChE was
even larger and was unaffected by ligand binding (Table  and Figure ). Thus, compared to that
of WT hBChE, differences in the “main door” aperture
for D340H, Y332S, and Y332S/D340H hBChE variants in the presence or
absence of nerve agent model compounds emerged as a probable mechanism
for resistance for these variants.

Discussion
Research
efforts have been directed toward identifying hBChE variants
that are resistant to organophosphorus compounds that could provide
a basis for new catalytic bioscavenger therapies., hBChE
variants that are resistant to OP or nerve agent model compounds
have been developed on the basis of the protein structure of hBChE.,,,, For example, rational design was used to
identify hBChE
variant G117H/E197Q, which is resistant to the PR/SCR, PSCS, and PRCS stereoisomers of soman with apparent rate constants of 0.006, 0.077,
and 0.13 min–1, respectively. However, the rate of soman hydrolysis catalyzed by G117H
or E197Q hBChE variants is not efficient enough to be useful for clinical
applications. Rational design of new OP-resistant variants may be
limited by the quality of the hBChE X-ray structures. It may be that
X-ray
crystal structures do not take into account the dynamic nature of
the protein structure. In addition, target
residues of mutagenesis are often
restricted to the active site or vicinity and may not encompass important
peripheral residues where the effect of structural distortions may
not be as apparent or would require a laborious process of mutagenesis
and iterative testing. For example, the
G117H hBChE variant introduces a relatively
large histidine side chain into the oxyanion binding region of the
active site of the WT enzyme. This is a major structural distortion
that may confer resistance to nerve agent model compounds and disrupt
enzymatic function of the enzyme itself.

By contrast, the method
described herein used a highly efficient
adenoviral cloning method to construct diverse mutant libraries. In
addition, a robust mammalian cell protein expression system was used
to express hBChE variants because hBChE has post-translational modifications
(i.e., glycosylation) required for optimal functional activity. Six libraries were designed to probe various
regions
of hBChE, including the gorge or substrate binding sites, the active
site residues of the catalytic triad (S198-E325-H438), and the PAS/omega
loop and acyl pocket regions (Figure S5 of the ). From
a functional screen, several nerve agent model
compound-resistant variants were identified. The presence of G116,
G117, and E197 variants discovered from both rational and molecular
evolution approaches shows the importance of the approach to identifying
residues in nerve agent model compound resistance. Amino acid 117 is part of the hBChE oxyanion hole that
can stabilize the substrate or putative transition state during ester
hydrolysis. Herein, several variants at amino acid residue 117 were
also identified, including known variants G117N and G117R that confer
resistance. Reportedly, G117H shows a stronger resistance to nerve
agent model compounds than G117N and -R because it forms two hydrogen
bonds with the substrate instead of one as in the case of G117N and
-R,,, and this may facilitate
hydrolysis of covalently
adducted organophosphate esters. We also previously reported
novel variants L125V and N68D that are resistant to nerve agent model
compounds. The increased KM values
for BTC hydrolysis for L125V and N68D hBChE variants as compared to
G117H indicate L125V and N68D variants may have a different mechanism
of nerve agent
model compound resistance. The L125 and N68 residues of hBChE are
near the entry site to the substrate binding gorge, possibly influencing
the opening of the gorge and accessibility and binding of the substrate.
These variants are unlikely to be directly involved in catalytic degradation
of covalently
adducted organophosphorous esters observed for G117H hBChE.
As further exemplified in this study, our approach has proven to be
broadly useful for identifying hBChE variants resistant to nerve agent
model compounds and is capable of finding combinatorial mutations
(e.g., Y332S/D340H variant) that afford marked resistance.

Proposed Mechanisms of Resistance to Nerve
Agent Model Compounds
A comparison of WT and hBChE variants
by protein backbone rmsd
analysis revealed unusual features. For WT hBChE and the Y332S variant,
the presence of SPGB3N in the active site
stabilized the conformation found in the crystal structure of PDB
entry 1P0I, whereas the unbound D340H and Y332S/D340H hBCHE
variants showed an
rmsd similar to that of the crystal structure of PDB entry 1P0I. This suggests that
the D340H and Y332S/D340H hBChE variant residues could, to some extent,
imitate the effects of the ligand binding on the overall structure.
For these two variants, the binding of ligand caused an increase in
rmsd that likely reflected the need for additional structural distortion
to accommodate the substrate. Such global rmsd analysis provided a
strong indication that the variants were different in their dynamics
and possibly in their substrate recognition. However, a more focused
rmsd analysis provided an opportunity to examine the marked differences
in the kinetic properties of hBChE WT and Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H
variants observed experimentally.

As recently described, hBChE
residues V288, Q119, L286, N68, A277, A328, F329, and Y332 of the
“main door” influence the activity of hBChE by determining
the accessibility of the substrate and active sites (Figure ). On the basis of these
observations and molecular dynamics simulations described herein,
residues at the opening of the hBChE gorge were generally among those
residues most distorted from the WT structure. Thus, alteration of
the “main door” could be the basis for significant resistance
to nerve agent model compounds observed for hBChE variants. Investigation
of the aperture of the “main door” by molecular dynamics
showed a potential new mechanism of resistance for Y332S, D340H, and
Y332S/D340H hBChE variants. The results show that the aperture for
WT hBChE was larger in the unbound enzyme than in the enzyme with
a nerve agent model compound bound in its active site. This suggests
that amino acids 332 and 340 play an integral part in the function
of hBChE because decreasing the “main door” size after
the binding of the substrate could increase the stability of the precomplex
between nerve agent model compounds and hBChE. The D340H hBChE variant
showed the opposite “main door” behavior between SPGB3N-bound and unbound configurations: the SPGB3N–hBChE form showed a larger aperture
that suggested that the “main door” was prevented from
closing.. In principle, this could lead to a lower level of nerve
agent model compound resistance by providing a nerve agent model compound
with an increased likelihood of dissociating from the active site
before reaction with an active site serine (S198) occurs. The analysis
of the Y332S hBChE variant suggested yet another mechanism for nerve
agent model compound resistance. In this case, the “main door”
is similar in size to the WT hBChE “main door” when SPGB3N is bound. However, in the absence of SPGB3N, the “main door” of WT hBChE
has the smallest aperture calculated among hBChE variants examined
(i.e., Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H). The smaller aperture of the
“main door” of the Y332S hBChE variant could restrict
the entry of substrates, especially larger ones, into the active site.
Compared to WT hBChE, the largest difference of the “main door”
aperture was observed for the double variant, Y332S/D340H hBChE. The
Y332S/D340H hBChE variant “main door” aperture was larger
than the WT hBChE “main door” aperture independent of
the presence of SPGB3N in the Y332S/D340
active site. In this case, the “main door” may be nonfunctional
and may permit SPGB3N to escape the
hBChE substrate binding site before reaction occurs with the active
site serine. The plausibility of this proposal is strengthened by
prior reports that have identified the role of various alternative
entries or exits for hBChE or hAChE kinetics.− Also, for hAChE, the aromatic residues lining the substrate
binding gorge have been reported to guide substrates to the active
site deep within the gorge. In addition
to being part of the “main door”,
residue 332 of hBChE is also part of the peripheral anionic binding
site for hBChE substrates. Because ETP is a positively charged inhibitor,
this difference in resistance
between ETP and SPGB3N is potentially
due to interaction of the positively
charged choline with the peripheral anionic binding site
as well as differences in the “main door” aperture distances.

We observed that the net effect on enzymatic function in the hBChE
variants reported herein was substrate-dependent. For example, the kcat for BTC hydrolysis by the Y332/D340H hBChE
variant is 2-fold greater than that of the WT enzyme, while the ki for inhibition of the Y332/D340H variant by SPGB3N was 70-fold lower than that of the WT
enzyme. Thus, structural modifications of the “main door”
appear to permit modulation of enzymatic function that does not necessarily
lower function for other substrates. This is further supported by
studies of the G117H hBChE variant that has a modified active site
and lower rates of BTC hydrolysis and inhibition by SPGB3N, at least as supported by these two specific examples.
Furthermore, molecular docking of SPGB3N
to the hBChE variants was very similar among variants (Y332S, D340H,
and Y332S/D340H) and WT hBChE. Accordingly, the resistance conferred
by the Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/D340H hBChE variants is less likely
to arise from direct modulation of the structure of the active site
catalytic triad (i.e., S198, E325, and H438), and this notion is supported
by the large distances between the variant residues and the active
site S198.

Novel variants
of hBChE (i.e., Y332S, D340H, and Y332S/340H) that are resistant to
nerve agent model compounds were discovered
using a molecular evolution–functional screening approach.
As shown by kinetic data and molecular dynamics studies, these hBChE
variants showed a unique mechanism of nerve agent model compound resistance.
The results show the utility of this method for identifying hBChE
variants that are resistant to NAs with unique mechanisms of action.
