Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)
appeared early in evolution as an enzyme that catalyzes a step in
glycolysis, a universal metabolic pathway. TIM catalyzes the stereospecific and reversible conversion of dihydroxyacetone
phosphate (DHAP) to (R)-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
(GAP),, by proton transfer reactions at carbon,
through enzyme-bound cis-enediolate reaction intermediates
(Scheme ). Intramolecular proton transfer
between C-1 and C-2 is conducted by the carboxylate side chain of
Glu165,− and the neutral electrophilic imidazole side chain of His-95 plays
a role in mediating proton transfer between O-1 and O-2 of the enediolate.− We are interested in understanding the mechanism of action of TIM
and intrigued by the repeating flexible loops at the archetypal TIM
barrel.− There is a strong probability that the properties of these loops
are well adapted for catalytic strategies perfected by TIM early in
evolution.− At least one strategy, the utilization of phosphodianion
binding energy for catalysis, has been
widely observed for enzymes that catalyze a variety of reactions,
including decarboxylation, proton transfer, hydride transfer, phosphoryl transfer, and a more complex
reaction.

The 11-residue flexible
loop 6 of TIM (Scheme ) is open in unliganded
TIM, to allow substrate free access
to the active site., Binding of DHAP to TIM triggers
closure of loop 6 over the substrate phosphodianion and formation
of the “caged” enzyme–PGA complex shown in Figure A., The alkyl ammonium side chain
of K12 stretches across the protein surface toward the base of loop
6 and forms a solvent-separated ion pair with the phosphodianion.
The side chain of K12 is anchored to the protein surface by an ion
pair with the carboxylate side chain of E97: its deletion results in a 105-fold decrease in kcat/Km for the K12G
mutant of TIM from yeast., Two lines of evidence
show that the interactions between loop 6 and dianions activate TIM
for deprotonation of bound carbon acid substrates.

(1) Deletion
of residues 170–173 from loop 6 of TIM from
chicken muscle (cTIM) and introduction of a peptide
bond between A169 and K174 disrupt loop–dianion interactions
but should leave the protein fold unaffected (Figure B). This loop deletion mutation
(LDM) results in a 105-fold decrease in kcat, but an only 5-fold increase in Km for isomerization of GAP. This shows that the strong stabilizing interactions between loop
6 and the ligand are expressed only at the transition state for the
isomerization reaction. Interactions between loop 6 and the enediolate
phosphate intermediate play the additional vital role of suppressing
the breakdown of the intermediate to form methylglyoxal and inorganic
phosphate,− the dominant nonenzymatic reaction of triosephosphates
in water.

(2) Cutting the connection
between the carbon acid and phosphodianion
of GAP allows the examination of the effect of TIM–dianion
interactions on catalytic activity., We have shown
that the binding of phosphite dianion to TIM results in a large increase
in enzymatic activity, as measured by the increase in the apparent
second-order rate constant, (kcat/Km)obs, for the TIM-catalyzed deuterium-exchange
reactions of truncated substrates glycolaldehyde (GA) and [1-13C]GA in D2O. Phosphite dianion activation of enzyme-catalyzed
proton transfer and decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by orotidine
5′-monophosphate decarboxylase,,, and for the hydride
transfer reaction catalyzed by glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
has also been observed.

solution, TIM exists as a homodimer. Here we show only the monomer
for the sake of clarity.

Loop 6 pivots around
the N-terminal (PVW) and C-terminal (KTA)
hinges during loop closure, while the “tip” residues
(AIGTG) move as a rigid body (Scheme ). The loop-open and -closed forms of TIM were
characterized by solid-state NMR,− solution NMR,, and temperature jump fluorescence spectroscopy studies, where it was concluded that loop opening and
closing is just sufficiently fast to account for TIM-catalyzed turnover
of substrate. Studies of mutants at hinge residues show that substitution
of glycine at these positions results in a decrease in catalytic activity., It was proposed that the Gly mutations result in an increase in
the number of protein conformations for the flexible loop-open form
of TIM, which provides an entropic stabilization of the unliganded
open enzyme compared with the rigid closed form of TIM.,

We report here the results of experiments on the loop 6 deletion
mutant (LDM), and of a loop 6 replacement
mutant (L6RM), where the N-terminal hinge sequence of TIM from eukaryotes
and bacteria, 166-PXW-168 (X = L or V), is replaced with the sequence
found in archaea, 166-PPE-168. These
include (a) steady-state kinetic and inhibition studies, (b) X-ray
crystallographic and solution NMR structural data for the L6RM, (c)
the products of the mutant cTIM-catalyzed reactions
of GAP in D2O,− and (d) kinetic and product data
for the mutant TIM-catalyzed reactions of [1-13C]GA in
D2O in the absence and presence of phosphite dianion., We show that the LDM serves as a benchmark for catalysis, where
there is little or no stabilization of the transition state for TIM-catalyzed
isomerization by interactions with loop 6. This assists in the development
of a structure-based interpretation of the effect of the L6RM on TIM-catalyzed
isomerization reactions.

25 °C were described in a recent publication.

Preparation of Enzymes
Wild-type cTIM was prepared as described previously, using expression vector pET-15b. This
plasmid was introduced into the TIM-deficient tpiA– λDE3 lysogenic strain of Escherichia
coli, FB215471(DE3),, and the enzyme was
expressed and purified according to published procedures., The concentration of TIM subunits was determined from the UV absorbance
at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 33460 M–1 cm–1 that was calculated from the ProtParam tool
available on the Expasy server.

Loop 6 Replacement
Mutant (L6RM)
Expression vector
pET-15b that contained the gene encoding wild-type cTIM was used to prepare the 167-VW-168 to 167-PE-168 mutant. The
mutation was completed in a single mutagenesis step using primers
5′-GGTTCTTGCCTATGAGCCACCAGAAGCTATCGGAACTGGTAAAACTGC-3′
(sense) and 5′-GCAGTTTTACCAGTTCCGATAGCTTCTGGTGGCTCATAGGCAAGAACC-3′
(antisense) and the wild-type plasmid as the cloning template. The
sequence of the plasmid strands was confirmed by DNA sequencing. This
plasmid was then introduced into the TIM-deficient tpiA– λDE3 lysogenic strain of E. coli, FB215471(DE3). For NMR and crystallography
experiments, wild-type and mutant TIM enzymes were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The loop 6 replacement mutant enzyme
was expressed and purified using the procedures described for wild-type cTIM., The concentration of TIM subunits
was determined from the UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction
coefficient of 27960 M–1 cm–1 that
was calculated from the ProtParam tool available on the Expasy server.

Loop 6 Deletion Mutant (LDM)
Plasmid
pBSX1cTIM, containing
the wild-type gene of cTIM, and E. coli strain DF502 (strepR, tpi–, and his–), whose DNA lacks the
gene for TIM, were generous gifts from
N. Sampson. The loop 6 deletion mutation was introduced into pBSX1cTIM
in two steps by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using the QuikChange
mutagenesis kit. A BsiWI restriction site was first
constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers
to change the wild-type sense sequence from CTAT to GTAC and the antisense
sequence from GATA to CATG: 5′-GTAAGGTGGTTCTTGCGTACGAGCCAGTTTGGGCTATC-3′
(sense) and 5′-GATAGCCCAAACTGGCTCGTACGCAAGAACCACCTTAC-3′
(antisense). The restriction site in this plasmid, pBS09, was used
to construct plasmid pBS10 for the loop 6 deletion mutant. The following
primers were synthesized: 5′-GTACGAGCCAGTTTGGGCTAAAACTGCTACTCCCCAACAGGCTCAGGAGGTTCATGAGAAGCTGAGAGGCTGGCTCAAAAGCCAC-3′
(sense) and 5′-GTGGCTTTTGAGCCAGCCTCTCAGCTTCTCATGAACCTCCTGAGCCTGTTGGGGAGTAGCAGTTTTAGCCCAAACTGGCTC-3′
(antisense). The sense primer was complementary to bases 489–507
and 520–585 of the gene for wild-type cTIM
and was designed to delete bases 508–519 that encode residues
170–173 of cTIM. The sequence of each constructed
plasmid strand was confirmed by sequencing. The LDM of cTIM was expressed and purified by following procedures developed
for wild-type cTIM., The concentration
of TIM subunits was determined from the UV absorbance at 280 nm using
an extinction coefficient of 33460 M–1 cm–1 that was calculated from the ProtParam tool available on the Expasy
server.

Isotope-Labeled L6RM for
NMR Studies
A sterile scraping
of a plasmid glycerol stock was used to inoculate a starter culture
in LB rich medium, which was grown to midlog phase. A small amount
of this culture was diluted 200-fold into M9 minimal medium [0.4%
(w/v) glucose] in 50% D2O, and the cells were grown overnight.
This entire culture was then transferred to 1 L of M9 minimal medium
in 99% D2O and grown to an OD600 of 0.6–0.8,
at which point 0.8 mM IPTG was added to induce protein expression
at 30 °C. When necessary, uniform isotopic labeling of TIM with 15N and 13C was achieved using 15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose as the nitrogen
and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
after being induced for 16–18 h and then stored frozen at −80
°C.

The frozen E. coli pellet was thawed
on ice and then lysed by two cycles of sonication in 10 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.5) in the presence of 1 mM protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride. The lysed cell culture was clarified by centrifugation at
20000g, and Benzonase (Novagen) was added to give
a final level of 25 units/mL of lysate. The crude lysate was loaded
onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF weak ion-exchange column and eluted with
the same buffer and a linear concentration gradient of KCl from 0
to 60 mM over a total volume of 400 mL at a flow rate of 2 mL/min.
Fractions containing cTIM were pooled and desalted
using an Amicon Centriprep Concentrator with a molecular mass cutoff
of 10000 kDa. The desalted sample was loaded onto the DEAE-Sepharose
FF column a second time to remove minor contaminants and remaining
traces of DNA. cTIM eluted from this second column
in a single elution peak centered at a salt concentration of ∼12
mM. The final eluted fractions containing cTIM and determined to be
more than 95% pure were pooled and dialyzed against appropriate buffers,
concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. The final protein yields were
between 30 and 50 mg from 1 L of growth medium.

X-ray Crystal
Structure Determination
The initial conditions
for crystallization of the L6RM of cTIM were determined
using Hampton Research Index HT, Crystal Screen HT, and SaltRx HT
screens. The final crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion
method at room temperature. The crystallization drops included 2 μL
of a 35.9 mg/mL solution of the L6RM of cTIM in 10
mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (pH 6.60),
10 mM sodium chloride, and 0.02% sodium azide mixed in a 1:1 ratio
with a precipitant of 26% PEG 3350 and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5). The typical
crystal size was 0.1–0.2 mm.

The X-ray data set for the
L6RM of cTIM was collected at SER-CAT beamline 22-ID.
The crystal was mounted on nylon loops and submerged in a 5 μL
volume of 30% PEG 3350 and 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) as a cryo solution.
Crystals were subsequently flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and mounted
under a stream of dry N2 at 100 K. The data set was collected
using a MAR 300 CCD detector. X-ray images were indexed, processed,
integrated, and scaled together using HKL2000. The data set for the L6RM revealed a C2 space group. Initial phases were readily obtained using Phaser
and wild-type cTIM (PDB entry 1TPH) as a starting model. WinCoot was used for model building, and Refmac
version 5.8 from the CCP4 suite was used for refinement. Anisotropic temperature factors were refined,
and occupancies were 1.00 for all atoms. Water molecules were added
to Fo – Fc density peaks that were greater than 3σ using the “Find
Water” WinCoot program function. The final models were checked
for structural quality using the CCP4 suite programs Procheck and
Sfcheck. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited
with the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry 4P61).

1H NMR Product
Analyses
1H NMR
spectra at 500 MHz were recorded in D2O at 25 °C using
a Varian Unity Inova 500 spectrometer that was shimmed to give a line
width of ≤0.7 Hz for each peak of the doublet due to the C-1
proton of GAP hydrate, or ≤0.5 Hz for the most downfield peak
of the double triplet due to the C-1 proton of [1-13C]GA
hydrate. Spectra (16–64 transients) were obtained using a sweep
width of 6000 Hz, a pulse angle of 90°, an acquisition time of
6 s, and a relaxation delay of 60 s (4T1) for experiments on the TIM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP in D2O or 120 s (&gt;8T1) for experiments
on the TIM-catalyzed reactions of [1-13C]GA in D2O., Baselines were subjected to a first-order
drift correction before determination of peak areas. Chemical shifts
are reported relative to HOD at 4.67 ppm.

Steady-State Kinetic Parameters
Values of kcat and Km for the LDM cTIM-catalyzed isomerization
of GAP (0.075–11 mM)
in solutions that contain 30 mM TEA buffer (pH 7.5) at I = 0.1 (NaCl) and 25 °C were determined from the nonlinear least-squares
fit of the initial velocity data to the Michaelis–Menten equation.
Arsenate (10 mM) was used as an activator for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase, the coupling enzyme in our assay for the L6RM-catalyzed
isomerization of DHAP (0.08–20 mM). A control experiment showed
that there is no detectable inhibition of the L6RM cTIM-catalyzed reaction by 10 mM arsenate. Inhibition of the L6RM-catalyzed
reaction of GAP in the presence of 2-phosphoglycolate (PGA, 1–10
mM) was examined at pH 7.5 (I = 0.1, NaCl) by determining
values of kcat/Km from the slopes of linear correlations of four or five values
of vi/[E] against [GAP] for reactions
at several different PGA concentrations.

Mutant cTIM-Catalyzed Isomerization of GAP
in D2O
The LDM and L6RM of cTIM
were exhaustively dialyzed at 7 °C against 30 mM imidazole (70%
free base) in D2O at pD 7.9 and I = 0.1
(NaCl). The reaction in a volume of 750 μL was initiated by
addition of enzyme to the reaction mixture containing GAP, imidazole
buffer (pD 7.9), and NaCl in D2O to give final concentrations
of 10 mM GAP, 10 mM imidazole [70% free base; I =
0.1 (NaCl)], and 0.4 μM L6RM or 7 μM LDM. Spectra (12
transients) were recorded continuously for a period of 2–4
h, during which time &gt;80% of GAP was converted to products. In
all
experiments, the fraction of the remaining substrate GAP (fGAP) and the fraction of GAP converted to products
DHAP (fDHAP), d-DHAP
(fd-DHAP), d-GAP
(fd-GAP), and methylglyoxal (MG, fMG) at time t were determined
from the integrated areas of the appropriate 1H NMR signals,
as described previously. The peak areas
were normalized using the invariant signal for the C-(4,5) protons
of imidazole as an internal standard.

Reaction of [1-13C]GA in D2O
The enzymes
were exhaustively dialyzed at 7 °C against 30 mM
imidazole (20% free base) in D2O at pD 7.0 and I = 0.1 (NaCl) or I = 0.024, for reactions
in the absence or presence of 40 mM total phosphite, respectively.
The reaction in the absence of HPi was initiated by the
addition of enzyme to a mixture, which contains [1-13C]GA,
imidazole, and NaCl in D2O, to give final concentrations
of 20 mM [1-13C]GA, 20 mM imidazole (pD 7.0, I = 0.1, NaCl), and 0.32 mM LDM or 0.39 mM L6RM of cTIM in a volume of 850 μL. The reactions in the presence of
HPi at 25 °C and I = 0.1 (NaCl) were
initiated by the addition of enzyme to a mixture, which contains 20
mM [1-13C]GA, 40 mM phosphite (50% dianion, pD 7.0), 10
mM imidazole (pD 7.0), and 0.32 mM LDM of cTIM or
0.23 mM L6RM of cTIM in D2O in a volume
of 850 μL. In each case, 750 μL of the reaction mixture
was transferred to an NMR tube. The NMR spectrum was recorded immediately
and then at regular intervals over a period of several days. After
the final spectrum had been recorded, the protein was removed by ultrafiltration
and the pD was determined. There was no significant change in pD (≤0.03
unit) during these reactions. The remaining reaction mixture was incubated
at 25 °C and used to monitor the TIM activity. The enzymatic
activity was unchanged during the time for these experiments. These
reactions were monitored for the disappearance of [1-13C]GA and for the formation of reaction products (Chart ), as described previously. Observed
first-order rate constants, kobs (s–1), for the disappearance of [1-13C]GA were
determined from the slope of linear semilogarithmic plots of the reaction
progress versus time (eq )where fs is the
fraction of [1-13C]GA that remains at time t. The observed second-order rate constant, (kcat/Km)obs, was determined
from the values of kobs using eq where fhyd equals
0.94 and is the fraction of [1-13C]GA present as the hydrate.

NMR Analyses of Protein
Structure
Concentrated stock
solutions of glycerol 3-phosphate for NMR experiments were prepared
gravimetrically in the same buffer used for the enzyme solutions.
The pH of this stock solution was adjusted to 6.6. All NMR samples
were prepared in buffer containing 10 mM MES, 10 mM NaCl, 0.02% (w/v)
NaN3, and 7.5% D2O (pH 6.6). Samples of cTIM were labeled with 2H, 13C, and 15N for chemical shift assignment or were uniformly (2H and 15N) labeled for ligand titration experiments. All
NMR experiments were performed at a static magnetic field strength
of 14.1 T on a Varian Inova spectrometer using a room-temperature
triple-resonance probe equipped with triple-axis gradients, with the
exception that the HNCA experiments were performed at a static magnetic
field strength of 21.2 T at the NMR Facilities Center at the University
of Colorado (Boulder, CO). Experimental temperatures were calibrated
using 100% methanol as a standard. NMR data were processed in NMRPipe and analyzed using Sparky. Two-dimensional 1H–15N NMR
experiments for all protein samples were recorded with identical parameters
using spectral widths of 2400 × 8000 Hz and 256 × 2048 points
in the t1 and t2 dimensions.

Three-dimensional backbone assignment experiments
require uniformly enriched labeling of 15N and 13C. Resonance assignments for wild-type cTIM were
obtained from those determined by J. Kempf in the Loria lab and deposited
as BioMagResBank entry 15064. Many resonances
in mutant enzymes could be assigned by direct comparison with the
wild-type 1H–15N correlation spectra.
These assignments were confirmed and ambiguities resolved using data
from TROSY-based HN(CA)CB− and HNCA experiments.

Binding of Glycerol 3-Phosphate
Formation of the complex
between G3P and wild-type cTIM was monitored at 25
°C in a series of TROSY-based 1H–15N correlation experiments. Protein samples were uniformly labeled
with 15N and perdeuterated. Using known assignments, the
change in the chemical shift of well-resolved peaks, with an increasing
G3P concentration, was monitored until ligand saturation, when the
chemical shifts were not affected by further ligand addition. Chemical
shift changes were quantified by eq in which H and N refer to the 1H and 15N residue
specific chemical
shifts, respectively, for wild-type and mutant enzymes.

Results
The genes for the 167-PE-168
loop 6 replacement mutant (L6RM) and
the 170-IGTG-173 loop deletion mutant (LDM) of cTIM
were expressed using different cTIM-deficient strains
of E. coli. The LDM was expressed from E.
coli strain DF502 (strepR, tpi–, and his–), while
the L6RM was expressed from the tpiA– λDE3 lysogenic strain of E. coli, FB215471(DE3)., The latter strain shows more robust growth and gives the better
yields of the mutant enzyme. The kinetic
parameters determined here for the LDM-catalyzed isomerization of
GAP at 25 °C are in agreement with the kinetic parameters reported
by Knowles and co-workers for reactions at 30 °C.

Assignment of Backbone Amide Resonances from
NMR
Three-dimensional
TROSY-based triple-resonance NMR experiments were utilized to assign
the backbone amide resonances in the L6RM. In addition to comparison
with the assignments of wild-type cTIM, TROSY-based HN(CA)CB and HNCA experiments were performed
on the apoenzymes of L6RM cTIM. Because the backbone
amide assignments are of primary interest, only the apoenzyme forms
of the mutants were prepared for three-dimensional NMR assignment
experiments with triple-isotope labeling. Backbone amide assignments
for G3P-bound L6RM and wild-type enzymes were obtained by performing
a G3P titration experiment, during which ligand binding-induced chemical
shift changes were monitored.

In total, 94 and 92% of all non-proline
backbone H and N resonances of the L6RM and the L6RM–G3P complex,
respectively, were assigned. Assignments of the backbone amides were
obtained for all of the non-proline residues in loop 6 of the L6RM
(residues 166–176) and for all of the residues in loop 7 (residues
208–211), except for Gly210. The signals for the backbone amides
of six residues in the L6RM, which were assigned for the apoenzyme,
could not be identified for the enzyme–G3P complex, due to
peak broadening or unresolved overlap with neighboring peaks.

Mutation-Induced
Changes in Chemical Shifts
A comparison
of wild-type and L6RM two-dimensional spectra is shown in Figure A. The chemical shift changes due to this mutation
are quantified using eq  and shown in Figure B for each residue. The elevated values of δNH (&gt;0.2 ppm) are mapped on the model for wild-type cTIM shown in Figure C. Significant
changes in the chemical shift for wild-type cTIM
were detected for the L6RM at residues Val161–Thr177, but the
values of δNH for G171, G173, and K174 are slightly
below 0.2 ppm. In loop 7, only V212 showed a δNH of
&gt;0.2 ppm. The L6RM also showed a significant δNH at
helix E1 and at residues Gly128–Glu145 of helix E2 (Figure B).

by circles. The side chains of the two mutated residues are depicted.
The positions of the active site and loop 6 are indicated to orient
the viewer.

Binding of Glycerol 3-Phosphate Monitored
by NMR
To
investigate the effect of the L6RM on enzyme–ligand interactions,
binding of the substrate analogue G3P to wild-type cTIM and binding to the L6RM on the amide chemical shifts were compared.
Titrations at 298 K were monitored by collecting a two-dimensional
NMR spectrum at each titration point (Figure A,B). Intermediate exchange was detected at multiple residues in
both wild-type cTIM and the L6RM as the peak intensities
gradually diminish as the titration end point is approached. The differences
in the patterns of the residue chemical shifts for this titration
indicate substantial differences between the conformations of loop
6 for the wild-type and L6RM enzymes. The final concentration of G3P
in solutions of cTIM was increased to 90 and 290
mM in NMR studies of wild-type cTIM and the L6RM,
respectively. Weak binding between G3P and wild-type cTIM was observed, which is consistent with a Ki value of 1.4 mM for G3P determined for TIM from yeast. The titration also shows that the binding of
L6RM to G3P is significantly weaker than in wild-type cTIM.

Summary of the effect of the binding of G3P to wild-type cTIM and to the L6RM on the NMR chemical shifts of backbone
amide resonances, for spectra acquired at 14.1 T, 298 K, and pH 6.6.

red, the position in the protein structure where the binding of G3P
results in significant values for δNH (&gt;0.1 ppm)
for wild-type cTIM (E) or the L6RM (F). The site
of the mutation is colored green in panel F.

Figure  illustrates the composite changes
in chemical shift (δNH) upon G3P binding as a function
of residue number in wild-type cTIM (Figure C) and the L6RM (Figure D). The overall averages of the values of δNH (eq ) observed upon binding of G3P are 0.043 ± 0.050
ppm for wild-type cTIM and 0.056 ± 0.040 ppm
for the L6RM, which are not significantly different. However, site
specific differences in δNH induced by binding of
G3P were noted for wild-type cTIM and the L6RM. Dramatic
responses to G3P binding are observed in multiple regions for the
wild-type enzyme, including loop 6 and loop 7, whereas in the L6RM
enzyme, the ligand-induced changes in the chemical shift at loop 6
are smaller, in particular, at residues in the N-terminal portion
of the loop nearest the mutations (Figure E,F). Other residues of wild-type cTIM, which show
notable changes in chemical shift induced by the binding of G3P, include
those in the vicinity of the active site such as N11, K12, H95, E97,
and G232, along with neighboring residues. In the L6RM, these same
residues do not experience chemical shifts of similar magnitude, indicating
non-wild-type-like ligand interactions at the active site.

Steady-State
Kinetics
Panels A and B of Figure  show the increase in vi/[E] for the
L6RM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP and DHAP, respectively,
in solutions that contain 30 mM TEA buffer (pH 7.5) at I = 0.1 (NaCl) and 25 °C. The small downward curvature in these
plots is consistent with either the formation of weak Michaelis complexes
with the substrate or a small decrease in kcat/Km from a specific salt effect of replacing
NaCl with the substrate dianion. There is no detectable decrease in
(kcat/Km)obs for the L6RM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP in solutions
that contain 30 mM TEA buffer (pH 7.5) at I = 0.1
(NaCl) and 25 °C, as the concentration of the strong competitive
inhibitor phosphoglycolate (PGA) is increased
to 10 mM (Figure S1, ). This gives a Ki of ≥40 mM (Table ) for inhibition by PGA, if it is assumed that a
20% decrease in kcat/Km could have been detected for the reaction at 10 mM PGA.
The values of kcat/Km for L6RM-catalyzed isomerization of DHAP and DGAP (Table ) were determined from the slopes of strictly linear
portions of the Michaelis–Menten plots shown in the insets
of panels A and B of Figure . The kcat/Km value of
470 M–1 s–1 for the L6RM-catalyzed
isomerization of GAP (Table ) and the assumption
that PGA and GAP show a similar weak affinity for the L6RM (Ki, Km ≥ 0.04
M) give a kcat limit of ≥20 s–1 for the L6RM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP (Table ).

equation, and the dashed line is the linear relationship of the data
at a low substrate concentration (≤3 mM). The inset shows the
linear correlation of the initial velocity data for ≤3 mM GAP

Mutant cTIM-Catalyzed Isomerization of GAP
in D2O
The mutant cTIM-catalyzed
reaction of GAP in D2O was monitored by 1H NMR
spectroscopy, as described previously. Three products form at the enzyme active site, DHAP, d-DHAP, and d-GAP, and, a fourth product, methylglyoxal,
may form by nonenzymatic and enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Scheme ). The yield of each
product, (fP)obs, was calculated
from the normalized 1H NMR peak area for a single proton
for the particular product (AP, eq ) and the sum of the peak areas of single protons
for all of the reaction products, as described previously. The fraction of GAP remaining at a given reaction
time (fGAP) was calculated as the ratio
of the normalized 1H NMR peak area of a single proton of
the remaining GAP, and the sum of the normalized 1H NMR
peak areas of single protons for GAP and for each reaction product.

Figure A shows
the decrease in fGAP with time during
the reaction of 10 mM GAP catalyzed by 0.4 μM L6RM cTIM in D2O buffered by 10 mM imidazole (70% free base)
at I = 0.1 (NaCl), pD 7.9, and 25 °C. The fit
of the data from Figure A to a single-exponential
decay gave a kobs of 2.7 × 10–4 s–1 for the disappearance of GAP.
Figure B shows the change with time in the
fractional product yields (fP)obs (eq ) for DHAP, d-DHAP,
and d-GAP during a 150 min L6RM-catalyzed reaction
of GAP. The yields of DHAP, d-DHAP, and d-GAP, determined by extrapolation of the product yields (Figure B) to zero reaction time, are listed in Table . A 4% yield of MG was also observed. Combining
a kN of 1.7 × 10–5 s–1 determined for the nonenzymatic elimination
reaction of GAP in D2O at pD 7.9 (10 mM imidazole), 25
°C, and I = 0.15 (NaCl) and a kobsd of 2.7 × 10–4 s–1 determined from the fit of data in Figure A gives a theoretical yield (fMG)N of 0.06 (eq ) if MG
forms exclusively by nonenzymatic elimination in the presence of 0.4
μM L6RM cTIM in D2O. This is not
significantly different from the (fMG)obs of 0.04 (Table ). We conclude that
MG forms mainly or entirely by a nonenzymatic reaction.

of 10 mM GAP
catalyzed by 7 μM LDM cTIM in D2O buffered by 10 mM imidazole (70% free base) at I = 0.1 (NaCl), pD 7.9, and 25 °C. The fit of the data from Figure C to a single-exponential decay gave a kobs of 7.5 × 10–5 s–1 for the disappearance of GAP. Figure D shows
the change with time in the fractional product yields, (fP)obs (eq ), for DHAP, d-DHAP, d-GAP, and MG during a 360 min

yields (Figure D) to zero reaction time are

Combining the kobs of 7.5 × 10–5 s–1 for the
reaction of GAP in
the presence of 7 μM LDM cTIM and the kN of 1.7 × 10–5 s–1 gives an (fMG)N of 0.23 (eq ) for the fractional yield of
methylglyoxal from the nonenzymatic elimination reaction (Table ). The observed yield of MG, (fMG)obs, equals 0.75, so that the yield from
the LDM-catalyzed reaction, (fMG)E, equals 0.52 (eq ). By comparison,
Knowles and co-workers reported 85 and 15% yields of MG and DHAP,
respectively, from the LDM-catalyzed reaction of GAP in H2O.

was monitored for 30 h, during which time the loss of 30% of the total
of [1-13C]GA was observed. The observed first-order rate
constant, kobs (s–1),
for the disappearance of [1-13C]GA and the observed second-order
rate constant, (kcat/Km)obs, determined as described in , are listed in Table .

Chart  shows the hydrated forms of the
four products of the TIM-catalyzed reaction of [1-13C]GA:
[2-13C]GA; [2-13C,2-2H]GA, [1-13C,2-2H]GA, and [1-13C,2,2-di-2H]GA.,,− The dideuterated product [1-13C,2,2-di-2H]GA
forms in a nonspecific protein-catalyzed reaction.,, Scheme  shows the
isomerization products [2-13C]GA and [2-13C,2-2H]GA, which form at the active site of TIM (Scheme ), and [1-13C,2-2H]GA, which
may form either at the enzyme active site or in a nonspecific protein-catalyzed
reaction.,, The major
product of the LDM-catalyzed reaction, [1-13C,2,2-di-2H]GA, forms in yields of 39 and 34% for the reactions in the
absence and presence of 0.020 M HPi, respectively. No [2-13C]GA or [2-13C,2-2H]GA was detected
from the LDM-catalyzed reactions, but [1-13C,2-2H]GA forms in 10 and 15% yields for the reactions in the absence
and presence of the dianion activator, respectively. The sum of the
observed product yields from these slow, mainly protein-catalyzed
reactions is less than 100%.,, The other products, from the slow nonenzymatic reactions of glycolaldehyde,
have not been identified.

The major product of the L6RM-catalyzed reactions
of [1-13C]GA in the absence (28% yield) and presence of
0.020 M HPi (34% yield) is [1-13C,2,2-di-2H]GA from a
nonspecific protein-catalyzed reaction. In the presence of 0.020 M HPi, small yields of 0.2 and
2% of the products of isomerization at the active site, [2-13C]GA and [2-13C,2-2H]GA, respectively, were
observed, along with a 10% yield of [1-13C,2-2H]GA. In the absence of HPi, no [2-13C]GA or
[2-13C,2-2H]GA was detected, and the yield of
[1-13C,2-2H]GA was 7%. In both cases, the yield
of [1-13C,2-2H]GA is similar to that for the
LDM-catalyzed reactions (above), for which no products of isomerization
at the enzyme active site are observed. This suggests that [1-13C,2-2H]GA forms mainly by nonspecific protein-catalyzed
reactions of the LDM and L6RM. An approximate value of 0.5 M–2 s–1 for (kcat/KHPiKGA) was calculated for the LR6M-catalyzed reaction (Scheme ), using eq , a (kcat/Km)obs of 0.25 M–1 s–1 (Table ), 0.020 M HPO32–, and the approximate product yield [∑(fP)E] of ≈0.04. This yield was estimated by
assuming equal 0.02 fractional yields of deuterium-labeled products
[1-13C,2-2H]GA and [2-13C,2-2H]GA from reactions of [1-13C]GA at the active
site of the L6RM of TIM

X-ray Crystal Structure for the L6RM
Solutions of the
L6RM were screened robotically against 288 precipitant conditions
from the Hampton Research’s HT screens. Numerous precipitant
conditions generated crystals. Ultimately, a solution containing PEG
3350 and Tris (pH 8.5) produced L6RM crystals that diffracted to 1.3
Å. Through utilization of molecular replacement, initial phase
information was obtained, which yielded the structure of the L6RM
as a dimer in space group C2. Data refinement and
collection statistics for the L6RM crystal structure are listed in
Table S1 of the .

The overall secondary and quaternary X-ray structure of L6RM is
a TIM barrel. Gaps in the electron density in the region of loop 6
are observed for both subunits A and B, with subunit A showing the
smaller gap, which runs from residue 173 to 175 (Figure S2 of the ). A close inspection of
the region containing loop 6 reveals several important differences
from the structure of wild-type cTIM and of several
other loop 6 mutants (PDB entries 1SU5, 1SW0, 1SW3, and 1SW7). Figure A shows that W168 of wild-type cTIM is directed toward the protein core by a cation−π
interaction with the side chain of R134,
and Figure B shows that formation of a complex
with the intermediate analogue phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH) induces
a conformational change, which replaces the cation−π
interaction by a hydrogen bond between the indole NH group and the
carboxylate side chain of E129 (Figure B).
By contrast, the better-defined structure for subunit A of the L6RM
shows the carboxylate side chain of E168 displaced toward solution,
compared with wild-type cTIM, probably to relieve
destabilizing interactions with the side chain of E129 (Figure C). The structure for loop 6 in TIM from eukaryotes
and bacteria is similar to that for archeal TIM,− because the
equivalent N-terminal hinge residue (W168 or E147) is stabilized by
functionally equivalent interactions with the protein core. This is
shown by the X-ray crystal structure of TIM from Pyrococcus
woesei (PwTIM) liganded to 3-phosphonopropanoic
acid, where the glutamate side chain of the 145-PPE-147 hinge interacts
with the protein core through a salt bridge to the side chain of K159
(Figure D).

for the L6RM, has no significant electron density from residue 173
to 175. (D) TIM from P. woesei liganded to 3-phosphonopropanoic

a position equivalent to that of W168 from cTIM,

Discussion
Sun and Sampson have prepared a library of 8000 mutants of the
N-terminal hinge of cTIM from chicken muscle [166-XXX-168].,, Only 3% of the library members
complement a DF502 TIM-deficient strain of E.coli and show ≈70% of the wild-type enzyme activity. Several noncomplementing members of this library
were characterized, including the glycine rich 166-GGG-168 mutant,
which showed a 130-fold decrease in kcat/Km. These
glycine mutations were proposed to result in an increase in the number
of protein conformations for the loop-open form of TIM. This corresponds
to the entropic stabilization of the open enzyme compared with the
active rigid closed form of TIM, which results in a significant entropic
price for ordering the flexible loop at the closed enzyme.,

The contributions of interactions between loop 6 and the substrate
phosphodianion to catalysis by TIM were examined in this work by eliminating
these interactions in the I170–G173 LDM and by modifying these interactions in the L6RM. The LDM
and L6RM result in large 800000- and 23000-fold decreases, respectively,
in kcat/Km for isomerization of GAP. Each mutation results in a decrease in
the affinity of substrates and intermediate analogues PGA and PGH
for cTIM (Table ), but the
ligands bind significantly more tightly to the LDM, where there can
be no stabilization of ligand by interactions with loop 6, compared
with the case for the L6RM, where the loop–ligand interactions
have been modified (Table ). This shows that
complexes of the L6RM are destabilized by the interaction between
the ligand and modified loop 6.

X-ray Crystallographic and NMR Structural
Studies
The
X-ray crystallographic and NMR structural data were obtained for proteins
in solutions that contain the same buffer. The crystal structure of
the unliganded L6RM shows that this substitution introduces a kink
into loop 6, which results in a large displacement of the carboxylate
side chain of Glu168 from the position of the tryptophan side chain
of W168 for the wild-type enzyme (Figure C).
There is a smaller movement in the position of the side chains for
the tip residues and a good overlap of the residues at the C-terminal
hinge, and in the positions of the catalytic side chains for H95 and
E165. The L6RM leads to significant changes in the chemical shifts
for nuclei at loop 6 and elsewhere in the protein (Figure B). An NMR titration shows that G3P binds with a
higher affinity to wild-type cTIM than to the L6RM.
The binding of G3P induces significant changes in the chemical shifts
for multiple nuclei in the regions of loops 6 and 7 of wild-type cTIM, and nuclei associated with residues 10–13,
94, and 95 (Figure C), but substantially smaller
changes in the chemical shifts for the corresponding nuclei of the
L6RM (Figure D). This shows that there are
substantial differences in the enzyme conformational change associated
with the binding of G3P to wild-type cTIM and the
L6RM.

The LDM provides a benchmark for the catalytic properties
of TIM for a case in which there is minimal enzyme activation by loop
closure over the substrate phosphodianion. The differences between
the kinetic parameters and products for the benchmark LDM- and L6RM-catalyzed
reactions provide strong evidence that the mutant loop 6 of the L6RM
plays an activating role by closing over the ligand phosphodianion
at the transition state for the TIM-catalyzed isomerization reaction.

(1) The &gt;700-fold larger value of kcat for the L6RM (&gt;20 s–1) compared with that of
the
LDM-catalyzed (0.03 s–1) isomerization of GAP (Table ) shows that the transition state for the former
reaction is stabilized by interactions with gripper loop residues.

(2) Good yields for the elimination reaction product methylglyoxal
are obtained from the LDM-catalyzed reaction of GAP, because of the
loss of interactions between the tip residues of loop 6 and the enediolate
intermediate, which stabilize the intermediate toward elimination
of inorganic phosphate., By contrast, no products
of an L6RM-catalyzed elimination reaction are observed. This provides
strong evidence that there is a strong stabilization of the bound
intermediate toward elimination of inorganic phosphate by interactions
with loop 6.

We therefore
propose that GAP and DHAP form Michaelis complexes
to the L6RM, which are destabilized by interactions with the twisted
loop, and that these complexes isomerize to the active loop-closed
enzyme, with loop 6 positioned in a manner similar to that for wild-type cTIM. Interactions between TIM and the appropriate spectrator
dianion, such as the phosphodianion of GAP or HPi, lock
the enzyme into a catalytically active form that is otherwise present
at low concentrations.,,,, This is shown
in Scheme , where GAP binds to form an initial
nonproductive complex to TIM and the conformational change to form
the active closed enzyme is favorable [KC ≫ 1 (Scheme )]. Our results provide
evidence that loop closure at the Michaelis complex with the L6RM
is unfavorable [KC ≪ 1 (Scheme )], because this creates destabilizing electrostatic
stress between the carboxylate side chains of E168 and E129 (Figure B). The weak binding of the ligand to the L6RM shows
that there is a large energetic price for removing the kink in loop
6, as this loop closes over the ligand dianion. Consequently, a large
fraction of the intrinsic ligand binding energy is utilized to drive
the enzyme conformational change, so that little binding energy is
available to stabilize the Michaelis complex. These results are consistent
with a malleable protein structure for TIM where the effect of mutations
such as the L6RM, which distort the protein structure, may be overcome
by utilization of the phosphodianion binding energy available to mold
the enzyme into the catalytically active loop-closed conformation.

Partitioning of the Reaction Intermediate
Table  reports the products of the partitioning of the
enediolate intermediate of the reaction of h-GAP
in D2O. These product yields define the macroscopic rate
constant ratio (kC1)H/kex (eq ) for partitioning
of the intermediate labeled with -H at the carboxylic acid side chain
of Glu165, between exchange of the -H for the -D from solvent to give
deuterium-labeled products, and transfer of -H to C-1 of the intermediate
to form DHAP, and (kC1)D/(kC2)D (eq ) for partitioning of the enediolate intermediate labeled with -D
at the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu165 between hydron transfer
to C-1 and C-2 to form d-DHAP and d-GAP, respectively.

The rate constant ratios (kC1)H/kex = 0.04
and 0.05 and (kC1)D/(kC2)D = 0.09 and 0.10 determined for
partitioning of the enediolate phosphate intermediates of the LDM-
and L6RM-catalyzed reactions, respectively, of GAP in D2O are remarkably similar to one another, but different from the ratios
of (kC1)H/kex = 0.96 and (kC1)H/kex = 1.48 determined for wild-type cTIM (Table ). We conclude that these mutations result in a decrease in
the velocity of formation of h-DHAP relative to the
rate of exchange of -H-labeled TIM with deuterium from solvent, and
in the rate of formation of d-DHAP relative to the
rate of formation of d-DGAP (Figure ). Formation of both h-DHAP and d-DHAP requires hydron migration from O-2 to O-1 of the enediolate
phosphate generated by deprotonation of GAP that is facilitated by
the imidazole side chain of His95 (Figure ). Our results suggest that hydron migration
between O-2 and O-1 is relatively fast and supports efficient wild-type cTIM-catalyzed isomerization but that this migration is
impaired at the LDM and L6RM, so that internal return of the O-2-protonated
enediolate phosphate to h-GAP and d-GAP is favored. The result is that a larger fraction of substrate
deprotonation steps are nonproductive and result in either “hidden”
internal return to regenerate h-GAP or the formation
of d-GAP. The fast washout of hydrogen from the active
sites of the LDM and L6RM, to give a 95–96% yield of deuterium-labeled
product, may also reflect an increase in the accessibility of the
active site to bulk solvent.

Scheme showing the minimal mechanism for the
TIM-catalyzed reactions
of GAP in D2O that results in the formation of h-DHAP, d-DHAP, and d-GAP.
The -H derived from the substrate may exchange with a pool of deuterium
at the enzyme. There is evidence that the transfer of hydrogen between
O-1 and O-2 of the enediolate reaction intermediate is mediated by
the imidazole side chain of His95.

Dianion
Activation of cTIM-Catalyzed Reactions
of [1-13C]GA
The major products of the LDM- and
L6RM-catalyzed reactions are [1-13C,2,2-di-2H]GA (30%) from a nonspecific protein-catalyzed reaction and [1-13C,2-2H]GA (10%) that may form either from an exchange
reaction at the active site of TIM or from a nonspecific protein-catalyzed
reaction.,, No [2-13C]GA or [2-13C,2-2H]GA is observed
from the LDM-catalyzed reactions of [1-13C]GA in the absence
or presence of 20 mM HPi, but the L6RM cTIM-catalyzed reaction of [1-13C]GA gives yields of 0.2
and 2% for [2-13C]GA and [2-13C,2-2H]GA, respectively, from formal isomerization reactions at the enzyme
active site. We conclude that the L6RM shows barely detectable activation
by HPi. We estimate a kcat/KGAKHPi value of ≈0.5 M–2 s–1 (eq  for Scheme ) for the reaction activated by 20 mM phosphite dianion () but that this rate constant is not significantly
different from 0 for the LDM.

Linear free energy relationship, with a slope
of 1.04 ± 0.03,
between logarithmic values of second-order rate constants [log(kcat/Km)GAP] for wild-type and mutant TIM-catalyzed isomerization of GAP and
the third-order rate constants [log(kcat/KHPiKGA)] for wild-type and mutant TIM-catalyzed reactions of the
substrate pieces GA and HPi (Scheme ). Most of these data were reported and discussed in an earlier publication. The dotted line shows an estimate for the smallest
third-order rate constant (kcat/KHPiKGA) that could have been detected by our experimental methods. Key
for mutants of TIM: green for TIM from Trypanosoma brucei, red for TIM from chicken muscle, and blue for TIM from yeast.

Figure  shows
the recently reported linear free energy relationship, with a slope
of 1.04 ± 0.03, between values of log(kcat/Km)GAP for wild-type
and mutant TIM-catalyzed reactions of (R)-GAP and
log(kcat/KHPiKGA) for reactions of the
substrate pieces glycolaldehyde and HPi (Scheme ). The horizontal dotted
line is drawn for the estimated limiting rate constant (kcat/KHPiKGA) of 0.25 M–2 s–1 for activation by 0.020 M HPi, assuming (kcat/Km)obs = 0.25
M–1 s–1 (Table ) and that the yield of the products of the specific TIM-catalyzed
reactions is ∑(fP)E &lt;
0.02 (eq ), which would be difficult or impossible
to detect by our methods. This limiting rate constant is approached
for mutant forms of TIM as (kcat/Km)GAP approaches 104 M–1 s–1. By comparison, (kcat/Km)GAP values
of 470 and 14 M–1 s–1 were determined
for the L6RM and the LDM, respectively. The kcat/KHPiKGA value of 0.5 M–2 s–1 estimated for the L6RM shows a positive deviation from the linear
correlation in Figure , and a similar positive
deviation has been reported for the loop 7 replacement mutant of cTIM., We conclude that the failure
to observe activation of the LDM by phosphite dianion is as expected
for the 800000-fold smaller value of (kcat/Km)GAP for the LDM, compared
with the value for wild-type cTIM-catalyzed reactions.
These results are consistent with the conclusion that a functioning
loop 6 is required to observe dianion activation of TIM for catalysis
of deprotonation of bound substrate, but they do not definitively
exclude the possibility of weak dianion activation of reactions catalyzed
by the LDM.

Conclusions
The results reported
here are consistent with the requirement that
TIM undergo an energetically uphill change in conformation from an
inactive open conformation to an active closed form, which is driven
by the intrinsic phosphodianion binding energy.,,,, Catalysis by the L6RM provides a remarkable example
of the plasticity of the structure of cTIM. We find
that the severe distortion in the structure of the unliganded wild-type
enzyme (Figure C) may be overcome by the utilization
of phosphodianion binding energy to mold cTIM into
the catalytically active closed form. The observed binding of the
substrate dianion to the L6RM is consequently much weaker than for
wild-type TIM. By contrast, there is compelling evidence that the
L232A mutation of TIM from Trypanosoma brucei reduces
the barrier for the phosphodianion-driven conformational change., The result of this reduced barrier to formation of the catalytically
active enzyme is that a larger fraction of the total dianion binding
energy is expressed at Michaelis complexes with GAP, DHAP, and HPi.,
