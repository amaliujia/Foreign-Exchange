The bleomycins (BLMs) are glycopeptide-derived
antitumor antibiotics consisting of a structurally complex hexapeptide
and a disaccharide (Figure a). Bleomycin was first isolated from a culture broth of Streptomyces verticillus. In
the United States, bleomycin is used clinically as a mixture of congeners
denoted Blenoxane, which consists mainly of bleomycin A2 and B2. It is employed for
the treatment of several types of cancer, notably squamous cell carcinomas
and malignant lymphomas. The therapeutically
useful effects of bleomycin are believed to be due both to its unique
ability to target tumor cells selectively, and
its ability to mediate double-strand cleavage of DNA.

We have reported previously that the tumor cell targeting
ability
of BLM requires the presence of the BLM disaccharide moiety, consisting
of l-gulose and 3-O-carbamoyl-d-mannose. More recently, by the use of
the BLM disaccharide conjugated to the cyanine dye Cy5**, we have
shown that the disaccharide moiety of BLM is also sufficient to allow
tumor targeting and cellular uptake. For
example, BLM A5 and BLM disaccharide conjugates selectively
bound to MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, but not to normal breast
cell line MCF-10A. The same selectivity was observed for a variety
of cancer and matched normal cell lines., These findings
suggest the possible utility of the BLM disaccharide moiety as part
of novel conjugates employed for cancer diagnosis and therapy.

One issue not addressed in any previous study is whether the BLM
disaccharide, while small and uncomplicated relative to the natural
product itself, actually represents the simplest structural entity
capable of selective tumor cell targeting. Here, we demonstrate that
3-O-carbamoyl-d-mannose, one of the two
sugars present in the BLM disaccharide, mediates selective targeting
of a number of tumor cell lines, and that its efficiency of targeting
and/or uptake as a conjugate with Cy5** is generally better than that
of the BLM disaccharide. Further, we demonstrate that the carbamoyl
moiety is absolutely required for selective tumor cell targeting and
describe a trimeric carbohydrate cluster, which displays a still greater
efficiency in tumor cell targeting and/or uptake.

Synthesis of BLM Monosaccharide–Dye
Conjugates
3-O-Carbamoylmannose, activated
as the diphenyl
phosphate ester, was prepared by modification of a reported procedure. Glycosyl donor 4 was coupled to
a CBz-protected commercially available linker (5), affording intermediate 6 in 96%
yield (Scheme S1 of the ). Deacetylation and hydrogenolysis of the primary amine afforded 7, which was treated with the N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) ester of Cy5** (8). BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
conjugate 1 was obtained in 36% overall yield (last three
steps). The Cy5** conjugate of decarbamoyl BLM monosaccharide (2) was prepared analogously starting from acetylated d-mannose (Scheme S2 of the ).

The synthesis of the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer
commenced with hydrogenolysis of the primary amine in 6 and subsequent conjugation to the NHS ester of protected linker 15, which afforded BLM monosaccharide trimer 16 in 40% yield (Scheme S3 of the ). Complete deacetylation, followed by hydrogenolysis of the primary
amine in 16 and subsequent coupling with the NHS ester
of Cy5** (8), provided the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
trimer conjugate in 33% overall yield for the last three steps.

(a) Comparison
of binding/uptake of BLM disaccharide–Cy5**
and BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugates by A549, A498, and
BxPC-3 cell lines. The cells were treated with 25 μM BLM disaccharide–Cy5**
(Figure S1 of the ) or BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** (1) conjugate at
37 °C for 1 h, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
The nuclei were stained with 2-(4-amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine
(DAPI). Fluorescence imaging was conducted with a 3 s exposure time.
(b) Quantification of the binding/uptake of BLM disaccharide–Cy5**
and BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugates in six cancer cells.
The cells were treated with 25 μM dye conjugates and irradiated
for 3 s prior to being imaged and then analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert
200M inverted microscope, with a 40× oil objective.

Cellular Binding/Uptake of the Dye Conjugates
Six cancer
cell lines were cultured on 16-well glass chamber slides for 48 h
and then treated with 25 μM BLM disaccharide–Cy5** (Figure
S1 of the ) or BLM
monosaccharide–Cy5** (1) conjugate for 1 h. The
cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
After irradiation for 3 s, fluorescence imaging (Figure a) was performed using an inverted microscope. The cells were
stained with DAPI to permit evaluation of localization of the conjugates
relative to the cell nuclei. It was clear that both BLM disaccharide–Cy5**
and BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugates underwent significant
binding and uptake in all three cell lines. Analogous results were
obtained using DU-145, BT-474, and MCF-7 cell lines (Figure S2 of
the ). The binding/uptake
was found to be specific for the cancer cell lines, as compared with
matched normal controls (Figure S3 of the ). Quantification of the data (Figure b) revealed that the binding/uptake of the BLM monosaccharide
was much (∼2-fold) greater in A549 lung cancer cells, A498
kidney cancer cells, and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. The binding/uptake
was almost identical for BT-474 human breast ductal carcinoma cells
and BxPC-3 human pancreas cells. In comparison, the uptake exhibited
by the BLM disaccharide–Cy5** conjugate was much greater in
DU-145 human prostate cancer cells.

(a) Binding/uptake of decarbamoyl BLM
monosaccharide–Cy5**
and BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugates in A549 and BxPC-3
cell lines. The cells were treated with 25 μM decarbamoyl BLM
monosaccharide–Cy5** or BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugate
at 37 °C for 1 h, washed and fixed. The nuclei were stained with
DAPI. Fluorescence imaging was conducted with a 3 s exposure time.
(b) Quantification of the binding/uptake of decarbamoyl monosaccharide–Cy5**
and BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugates in four cancer cell
lines. The cells were treated with 25 μM dye conjugates and
irradiated for 3 s prior to being imaged.

To better define the importance of the carbamoyl group for
cellular
recognition, binding, and internalization, we conducted an experiment
in which four cancer cell lines were treated with 25 μM decarbamoyl
BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** (2) or BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
(1) conjugate and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde.
After the samples had been exposed to a xenon lamp for 3 s, the fluorescent
images (Figure a and Figure S4 of the ) were recorded. None of
the four cell lines bound decarbamoyl BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
(2) to a significant extent, indicating that the carbamoyl
group is essential for tumor cell binding/uptake. The quantified binding/uptake
results are summarized in Figure b.

Cellular receptors for carbohydrates frequently exhibit multivalency.
Accordingly, we studied the cellular targeting and uptake of a Cy5**
conjugate containing a cluster of three carbamoylmannose molecules
(3). The BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer (3) and the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugate (1) were studied in six cancer cell lines. As shown in Figure a for the A498 and A549 cell lines, the binding/uptake
of the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer was greater than that
of the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugate. The same finding
was made in four additional cell lines (Figure S5 of the ). The quantified data
are shown (Figure b) and reflect the (1.6–2.3-fold)
greater binding/uptake of the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer
in the cell lines, consistent with the targeting of some cell surface
carbohydrate receptor.

(a) Binding/uptake of BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
and BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
trimer conjugates in A498 and A549 cell lines. Cells were treated
with 25 μM BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugate or BLM
monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer at 37 °C for 1 h, washed and
fixed. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Fluorescence imaging was
conducted with a 3 s exposure time. (b) Quantification of the binding/uptake
of the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** conjugate and the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
trimer in six cancer cells. The cells were treated with 25 μM
dye conjugates and irradiated for 3 s prior to being imaged.

As for the BLM disaccharide–Cy5**
conjugate, the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5**
conjugate presumably first binds to a cell surface receptor followed
by internalization. This model is supported by the results obtained
with the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer, which showed enhanced
uptake in each of six cell lines (Figure ).
The lack of cell surface fluorescence presumably indicates that internalization
is rapid relative to cell binding. For the BLM disaccharide, evidence
in support of this model was obtained by attaching multiple BLM disaccharides
to the surface of a microbubble, which was too large to be internalized
readily. The derivatized microbubbles
were shown to be bound specifically to cancer cells. Here, the majority
of fluorescence within the cells was found to colocalize with DAPI,
suggesting that the conjugates were present within the nucleus. The
use of fixed cells for this analysis after a defined period of incubation
imposes some limitations on the conclusions that can be drawn from
these observations, as does the lack of information regarding the
mechanism(s) of cellular uptake and the receptor(s) responsible. While
entirely within the realm of speculation at present, the selective
recognition of numerous cancer cell lines suggests that the carbamoylmannose
moiety may recognize some cell surface structural alteration resulting
from a process common to most cancer cells, such as the well-known
metabolic shift to energy production from glycolysis as compared with
oxidative phosphorylation.

In addition to its enhanced efficiency
of uptake, the smaller size
and complexity of the BLM monosaccharide relative to the BLM disaccharide
should facilitate the preparation of conjugates for potential diagnostic
and therapeutic applications. The increase in binding/uptake observed
for the BLM monosaccharide–Cy5** trimer provides evidence of
the nature of the receptor, and a tool for further studying and exploiting
the tumor targeting properties of 3-O-carbamoylmannose.
