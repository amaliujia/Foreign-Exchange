Recently, the ability of mycobacteria
to catabolize cholesterol has been the subject of intense study because
of a requirement for cholesterol metabolism in models of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis persistence in infection.,M. tuberculosis Rv3409c and its Mycobacterium smegmatis ortholog MSMEG1604 were proposed to function in
sterol metabolism on the basis of their similarities to well-characterized
cholesterol oxidases, ChoEs, which catalyze
the conversion of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one. Interestingly,
disruption of the Rv3409c gene in M. tuberculosis leads to attenuated survival in macrophages and in the mouse model
of infection.Rv3409c contributes to inhibition of the bactericidal activity of macrophages
by interfering with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)-mediated signaling,
thereby enhancing interleukin-10 production and suppressing NO production.

In Rhodococcous equi and Streptomyces, the cholesterol oxidase choE genes are required
for catabolism of cholesterol as a sole carbon source. However, gene
disruption studies of MSMEG1604 in M. smegmatis and Rv3409c in M. tuberculosis demonstrated that this gene is not required by either mycobacterium
species to mineralize cholesterol.− Furthermore, assays to directly detect cholestenone
formation with purified protein or lysates containing expressed MSMEG1604 found no evidence of product formation,, despite reports that cell lysates containing expressed Rv3409c and cholesterol produce hydrogen peroxide., Both Rv3409c and MSMEG1604 share a low level
of amino acid identity (∼24%) with experimentally characterized
cholesterol oxidases (choE) from R. equi and Streptomyces sp. as well as other glucose–methanol–choline (GMC) oxidoreductase
superfamily members; the conserved amino
acids are predominantly in the FAD binding region. The low level of
identity and similarity between substrate binding amino acids and
the absence of a cholesterol catabolism phenotype and cholesterol
oxidation catalytic activity lead to the conclusion that the gene
function has been misassigned.

Fortuitously, in a phenotypic
screen to identify genes associated
with glyopeptidolipid (GPL) production, Reyrat and co-workers isolated
an MSMEG1604 mutant Myc11., The colony morphology of Myc11
changed from smooth to rough, although mutant colonies were still
stained by the hydrophobic dye phenol red. On the basis of the cell
wall morphology phenotype, we undertook differential mass spectrometric
profiling of the mutant lipidome as a first step in understanding
the biochemical function of MSMEG1604 and its orthologs.

Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectral analysis revealed that the majority of the lipids produced
by wild type (WT) and Myc11 were the same. However, the relative amounts
of the GPL species were reduced in Myc11 (Figure S1 of the ). Moreover, a relatively
abundant new lipid appeared in the Myc11 mass spectral profile (Figure ). The primary molecular ion for the new lipid is
at 1334 Da, and the lipid is henceforth termed L1334.

Enlarged region of the
MALDI-TOF mass spectra of total lipids of M. smegmatis mc2155, the Myc11:pMS100 complement, the Myc11:pMS101
complement, and Myc11. The full spectra are shown in Figure S1 of
the .

Two complementation strains were constructed [Myc11:pMs100
and
Myc11:pMs101 (Tables S1 and S2 of the )]. Complementation of Myc11 with MSMEG1604 abrogated production of L1334, and the WT GPL profile was restored
(Figure  and Figure S1 of the ). Moreover, complementation
restored the red, smooth phenotype. Single colonies of WT M. smegmatis mc2155 and Myc11 grew to a 1 cm
diameter after 2 weeks at 37 °C with glycerol as the carbon source.
Single colonies of complemented Myc11 were 80–90% the size
of WT colonies, suggesting that the constructs introduced some additional
metabolic burden.

On the basis of the apparent differences in
GPL species between
WT and Myc11, we performed thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis
of native GPLs isolated without alkali treatment, which deacetylates
sugar hydroxyls. The TLC analysis again indicated that a unique lipid
accumulated in Myc11 (Figure S2A of the ). The polarity of this lipid was slightly higher
than that of native GPLs isolated from WT M. smegmatis without alkali treatment. Neither Myc11:pMs100 nor Myc11:pMs101
produced this unique lipid, and the native GPL distribution was almost
completely restored in the complemented strains, although the relative
amounts were not identical to that of the wild type.

(A) Proposed structure
of L1334. Arrows denote fragments lost in
MSn experiments shown in Figure S3 of
the . Regions of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra corresponding to (B)
four methyl ether and (C) three sugar anomeric hydrogen resonances.

L1334 was purified to near homogeneity
using silica column chromatography.
The exact mass of L1334 is 1333.8617 Da (3 ppm tolerance). Consistent
with a lipid structure, additional species were observed that differ
from the molecular mass of L1334 by multiples of 28 Da, corresponding
to a CH2CH2 moiety, i.e., at m/z 1305.8, 1362.1, and 1390.8 Da.

Myc11 was
grown in minimal medium constituted with [15N]NH4Cl. Comparison of the 15N-labeled WT and 15N-labeled Myc11 mass spectral profiles revealed a lipid in 15N-labeled Myc11 with a molecular ion [M + Na]+ at 1338
Da and loss of the 1334 Da molecular ion. Isolation of 15N-labeled L1334 by preparative TLC confirmed the m/z of the molecular ion to be 1338.7 Da
(Figure S2B of the ). Therefore, on the basis of the exact mass and four nitrogen atoms,
the molecular formula for L1334 was assigned as C69H122N4O19Na (calcd [M + Na]+, 1333.8601 Da; observed [M + Na]+, 1333.8617 Da).

The molecular formula in combination with the TLC polarity data
suggested that L1334 is a GPL derivative. We analyzed the composition
of extracted total lipids from the WT and Myc11 strains with and without
alkali treatment by TLC. L1334 is stable to alkali treatment, consistent
with the absence of acetyl groups in its isolated form. Moreover,
L1334 has the same polarity as deacetylated GPL-5 (Figure S2C,D of
the ), which also
has a mass of 1334 Da (MNa+). On the basis of the molecular
formula, we proposed the deacetylated GPL-5 structure shown in Figure A.

The mass spectral fragmentation of L1334
revealed a loss of 164
Da from the parent ion ([M + Na]+ = 1333.86 Da) that yielded
a daughter ion at m/z 1169.79 Da
(Figure S3 of the ). A loss of 160 Da from this daughter yielded a MS3 ion
at m/z 1009.71 Da. This ion was
further fragmented with a loss of 174 Da to yield a MS4 ion at m/z 835.62 Da. The three
neutral losses of 164, 160, and 174 Da were attributed to the loss
of three sugar residues from the parent molecule. Notably, there was
no loss of 174 Da from the 1169.79 Da daughter ion, confirming the
assignment of the 160/174 disaccharide moiety. In addition, each of
the MS2, MS3, and MS4 ions loses
neutral fragments corresponding to loss of water and CH3OH (Table S3 of the ). These fragments indicate that the L1334 structure contains methoxy
ethers. Moreover, no loss of acetoxy was observed, indicating the
absence of acetylated residues in the d-allo-6-deoxytalose.
The regiochemistry of methylation and dirhamnosylation is based on
comparison to that of previously characterized M. smegmatis deacetylated GPL-5 that migrates like L1334 via TLC (Figure S2C
of the ).−

The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum
of
L1334 is consistent with that of a GPL structure: (a) a tetrapeptide
sequence, which includes phenylalanine, threonine, alanine, and alaninol;
(b) a long fatty acyl chain; (c) three sugar residues; and (d) methyl
ethers (Figure B,C). No acetyl resonances
were observed. The NMR spectra confirmed the deacetylated, trisaccharide
glycopeptidolipid structure of L1334.

Myc11 produces lipid L1334
in the late stationary phase. A similar
hyperglycosylated GPL is formed in M. smegmatis under
carbon starvation conditions, although the sugars are acetylated normally., Thus, the production of hyperglycosylated GPL is linked to nutrient
availability.

GPLs are the major surface-exposed lipid components
in M. smegmatis(−) and affect colony morphology,
sliding motility, and
biofilm formation., Therefore, loss of acetylation
is consistent with the Myc11 rough phenotype. The acetyltransferase
responsible for acetylation of GPL is Atf1. However, the MSMEG1604 gene is not located in the
GPL biosynthetic gene cluster.

We assayed the Rv3409c protein with a variety of alcohol substrates,
including cholesterol, methanol, ethanol,
pentan-1-ol, choline, glucose, myoinositol, 2-phenylethanol, benzyl
alcohol, rhamnose, 6-deoxytalose, and L1334. No enzymatic activity
was detected with any of these substrates. Our data suggest that MSMEG1604 and its orthologs encode a new member of the GMC
oxidoreductase superfamily with an as yet unidentified substrate.

GPLs isolated from pathogenic non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, e.g., Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare, stimulate the macrophage inflammatory response through TLR-2. Acetylated GPL is required for this stimulation, and the number and pattern of O-acetyl groups on the 6-deoxytalose of GPL are important for TLR-2
signaling., Moreover, deacetylated GPLs are
biologically inactive. Similarly, lippomannan
acetylation affects TLR-2 agonist activity in M. tuberculosis.

It has recently been shown that M. tuberculosis Rv3409c is indispensable for the modulation
of TLR-2-mediated signaling. Disruption
of MSMEG1604 leads
to an alteration of GPL production in M. smegmatis and to the formation of an unusual GPL species that is nonacetylated
and hyperrhamnosylated. Our data suggest that Rv3409c controls acetylation of cell surface glycolipoproteins to modulate
the host innate immune response.
