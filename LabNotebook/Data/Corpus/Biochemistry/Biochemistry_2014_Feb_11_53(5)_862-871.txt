The protein
tyrosine phosphatase
(PTP) superfamily is broadly grouped into four subfamilies, of which
the first and largest subfamily (Class I) includes 99 cysteine-based
phosphatases., Class I PTPs are divided into
classical PTPs, which dephosphorylate exclusively phospho-Tyr, and
dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs), which can hydrolyze phosphate
groups of phospho-Tyr and phospho-Ser/Thr residues. Since the discovery
of the first DSP, VH1, encoded by Vaccinia virus, 61 VH1-like DSPs have been identified in all
kingdoms of life. The human genome encodes 38 VH1-like DSPs (also
termed “DUSPs”) that function
as critical signaling molecules, are central to cell physiology, and
are involved in a myriad of pathological processes that lead to disease. VH1-like DSPs can be further divided into six
subgroups on the basis of amino acid sequence conservation. One subgroup includes 19 “atypical”
DSPs, which usually lack an N-terminal
Cdc25 homology domain common to mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases
(MKPs) and vary greatly in size from the 150 amino acids of VHZ (DUSP23) to the 1158 residues of DUSP27. Atypical DSPs possess broad substrate specificity and dephosphorylate
peptidic and nonpeptidic substrates. For instance, laforin functions
as a glycogen phosphatase, the mitochondrial
phosphatase PTPMT1 dephosphorylates phosphatidylglycerol phosphate, and PIR1, described in this paper, is specific
to RNA.

PIR1 (phosphatase that
interacts with RNA–ribonucleoprotein
complex 1), also known as DUSP11, is a ubiquitous member of the VH1 superfamily
whose phosphatase core shares a high level of sequence identity with
the RNA 5′-phosphatase BVP from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus., Mainly localized to
the cell nucleus, PIR1 was originally identified as being associated
with RNA or ribonucleoprotein complexes.In vitro, the PIR1 phosphatase activity is several
orders of magnitude higher for RNA than phosphoprotein substrates,
with a marked preference for phospho-Tyr over phospho-Ser/Thr residues. The protein has 5′-triphosphatase and
diphosphatase activity for short RNAs but is less active toward mononucleotide
triphosphates, suggesting its primary function in vivo is to dephosphorylate RNA 5′-ends. PIR1’s exact physiological substrate is unknown, but several
lines of evidence link this phosphatase to RNA splicing. Using a yeast
two-hybrid screen, it was found that PIR1 associates with splicing
factors 9G8 and SRp30C. Both in vitro and in vivo, PIR1 binds to splicing
factor SAM68, and this activity may contribute to p53-dependent inhibition
of cell proliferation. PIR1 expression
and phosphatase activity have also been linked to cancer. The PIR1
gene is overexpressed in colon carcinoma and glioblastoma tumor cell
lines, and expression of PIR1 is induced
in a p53-dependent manner after treatment with DNA-damaging agents.
Ectopic expression of wild-type PIR1 in a cell culture leads to growth
arrest, while silencing its expression increases the level of proliferation
of normal and DNA-damaged cells in a tissue culture. In addition, the PIR1 transcript is differentially expressed
in mucosal tissue from patients suffering from inflammatory bowel
diseases. In Caenorhabditis elegans, PIR1 (also termed PIR-1) was identified
as a cellular factor that specifically interacts with Dicer DCR-1.
In both embryos and adult worms, PIR1 is essential for the development
and RNA interference (RNAi): because of its unique ability to hydrolyze
RNA 5′-γ- and β-phosphates, PIR1 was hypothesized
to generate optimal 5′-monophosphate products for recognition
by Dicer or Argonaute proteins involved in downstream steps of RNA
silencing.

In this paper, we report
a high-resolution structure of the human
PIR1 catalytic core and a biochemical characterization of active site
residues involved in catalysis. Our work defines novel and conserved
features of an atypical DSP that has RNA 5′-triphosphatase
and diphosphatase activity.

Experimental Procedures
Molecular Biology and Biochemical
Techniques
A synthetic
gene encoding human PIR1 was cloned in expression vector pGEX-6P-1
(Novagen) between restriction sites BamHI and XhoI. Deletion constructs
PIR1-coreFED (residues 29–222), PIR1-core (residues
29–205), and PIR1-DSP (residues 66–205) were generated
by polymerase chain reaction. Point mutations C152S, H154A, N157A,
R192K, and H119G and double mutant H154A/N157A were introduced by
site-directed mutagenesis. The fidelity of the DNA sequence for all
constructs generated in this study was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Because of its toxicity, all constructs of catalytically active PIR1
(containing C152) were expressed in the NEB Express Iq Escherichia
coli strain that produces large quantities of LacI repressor,
whereas constructs of catalytically inactive PIR1 (containing C152S)
were expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. In
both cases, cells were grown for 6 h at 25 °C after induction
with 0.4 mM IPTG at an OD600 of ∼0.6. Cells were
lysed by sonication in lysis buffer [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM
sodium chloride, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM PMSF, and 0.25%
DDM], and GST–PIR1 fusion proteins were purified by sequential
passages over GST beads (GenScript). GST was cleaved off with PreScission
Protease (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C followed by size exclusion
chromatography on a Superdex-75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
in 200 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol,
and 0.1 mM PMSF. PIR1 constructs used for crystallization were concentrated
to ∼20.0 mg/mL using a 10K molecular weight Vivaspin 15 concentrator
(Sartorius).

Thermal Stability
Thermal stability
measurements were
recorded using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab
RTE7 refrigerated recirculator, as previously described., PIR1-C152S-coreFED dissolved at a final concentration
of 17.0 μM in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 50 mM NaCl
was measured using a 1 mm long × 12.5 mm wide quartz cuvette
(Starna Cells, Inc.), which holds 0.4 mL. Variations in ellipticity
at 222 nm as a function of temperature were measured in 0.2 °C
increments between 25 and 90 °C. Slow cooling to 25 °C followed
by a CD scan at 222 nm to assess the presence of secondary structures
demonstrated that PIR1-C152S-coreFED unfolds irreversibly.

Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination
Crystals of PIR1-C152S-coreFED were obtained using the
hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing together 2 μL
of gel filtration-purified protein at a concentration of 20.0 mg/mL
with 1 μL of 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), 0.2 M sodium chloride,
and 22% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, at 18 °C. Addition of
5 mM AMP to the crystallization droplet increased the crystal size
and reproducibility. Crystals of the smaller construct PIR1-C152S-core
were obtained by mixing together 2 μL of gel filtration-purified
protein at a concentration of 20.0 mg/mL with 2 μL of 0.1 M
potassium thiocyanate and 34% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl
ether 2000, also at 18 °C. Crystals were harvested in nylon cryo-loops,
cryo-protected using 27% (w/v) ethylene glycol, and flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on beamlines X6A
and X29, at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) on ADSC Quantum
270 and Quantum 315r CCD detectors, respectively. Data indexing, integration,
and scaling were conducted with the HKL2000 software package. PIR1-C152S-coreFED crystals belong
to space group P213 with one copy in the
asymmetric unit and are complete to 1.85 Å resolution (Table ). In contrast, PIR1-C152S-core crystallized in
a primitive orthorhombic space group (P212121) with a trimer in the asymmetric unit.
Diffraction data were collected to 1.20 Å resolution, although
the completeness of the data is modest in the outer shell: X-ray data
are 55.5% complete between 1.24 and 1.20 Å, 74.9% complete between
1.29 and 1.24 Å, and &gt;95% complete between 1.29 and 15.0 Å
(Table ). The structure of PIR1-C152S-coreFED was determined by molecular replacement using the structure
of BVP [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1YN9] as the
search model, as implemented in PHASER. This initial phasing model was subjected to manual rebuilding using
COOT followed by refinement with phenix.refine, using cycles of positional and isotropic B factor refinement with six distinct translation/libration/screw
(TLS) groups. The PIR1-C152S-coreFED final model contains
residues 29–207 of human PIR1, five N-terminal residues from
the expression vector (sequence of GPLGS), 181 water molecules, a
phosphate, and a chloride ion and was refined to Rwork and Rfree values of 16.85
and 18.75%, respectively, using all diffraction data between 15 and
1.85 Å resolution (Rfree was calculated
using 1129 randomly chosen reflections, corresponding to ∼5%
of all diffraction data) (Table ). This model
was then used to determine the orthorhombic crystal form of PIR1-C152S-core
that contains a trimer in the asymmetric unit. An initial solution
obtained using PHASER was first refined
isotropically with Refmac_5.8.0049 until Rfree dropped below 20%. At this point, the solvent
was built using phenix.refine, riding
hydrogens were added to protein atoms, and the model was further subjected
to several cycles of positional and anisotropic B factor refinement in Refmac_5.8.0049, using all diffraction data
between 6.0 and 1.20 Å (Table ). The
PIR1-C152S-core final atomic model contains residues 29–205
for chains A–C (and five N-terminal residues, GPLGS, from the
expression vector are visible for chains A and B), 973 water molecules,
three phosphates, and three chloride ions and was refined to Rwork and Rfree values
of 13.73 and 16.99%, respectively (Rfree was calculated using ∼5% of the diffraction data). Stereochemistry
was checked using PROCHECK: atomic models
of PIR1-C152S-coreFED and PIR1-C152S-core have outstanding
geometry, with root-mean-square deviations (rmsds) from ideal bonds
and angles of 0.012 Å and 1.378° and 0.009 Å and 1.472°,
respectively, and &gt;91% of residues in the most favored regions
of
the Ramachandran plot and no disallowed residues. Atomic coordinates
and experimental structure factors of PIR1-C152S-coreFED and PIR1-C152S-core have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
as entries 4MBB and 4NYH,
respectively.

Structure Analysis and Molecular Docking
All ribbon
diagrams and surface representations presented here were prepared
using Pymol (Delano Scientific). Nonlinear Poisson–Boltzmann
electrostatic calculations were performed using APBS Tools. The topological diagram was generated using
PDBsum, and structural superimpositions
were conducted in Coot. Analysis of cavities
was done using VOIDOO, as described previously. Solvent accessibility surface (SAS) areas were
calculated using Chimera. In this program,
the SAS is defined as the locus of the center of a probe sphere (representing
the solvent molecule) as it rolls over the van der Waals surface of
the protein. Analysis of the interactions between ClAS and
the PIR1 active site was conducted using LigPlot. Docking of ATP and ADP inside PIR1-core was performed using
AutoDock Vina and HADDOCK.

In Vitro Phosphatase Assay
Hydrolysis
of 200 μM ATP or ADP substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was assessed
in dephosphorylation buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl,
2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT] in 60 μL reaction mixtures containing
5 μg of purified PIR1-coreFED, at 22 °C. Phosphatase
reactions were terminated after 50 min via addition of 60 μL
of 0.1 M N-ethylmaleimide and 120 μL of Malachite
green reagent, as previously described. Fifteen minutes after the reaction had been quenched, the absorbance
was measured at 620 nm, a blank was subtracted, and the exact quantity
of released phosphate was determined using a phosphate standard curve.
The enzymatic activity of PIR1-coreFED carrying alanine
substitutions at H154, N157, and both H154 and N157 was monitored
using the phospho-substrate OMFP (Sigma-Aldrich), at a final concentration
ranging from 10 to 300 μM, as previously described. The dephosphorylation reaction was initiated
by addition of purified PIR1-coreFED constructs to the
reaction mix at a final concentration of 1 μM. Dephosphorylation
of OMFP was monitored at 477 nm using a Tecan Infinite M1000 PRO plate
reader (Tecan), at 22 °C. For each concentration of OMFP, the
initial linear rate of product formation (or initial velocity) was
calculated from the variation in absorbance over the first 120 s of
the reaction. For each PIR1 construct, initial velocities were plotted
against the concentration of OMFP, and Km, Vmax, and kcat values were determined by nonlinear regression using GraphPad (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). A list of all kinetic parameters is given in Table .

Results
Domain
Organization of Human PIR1
Human PIR1 is a 330-residue
nuclear protein with a predicted molecular mass of ∼38939 Da.
Bioinformatics analysis identified a conserved DSP domain between
residues 66 and 205, which is 41% identical to the RNA 5′-phosphatase
domain of BVP., The PIR1 catalytic core is flanked
by two regions with low levels of complexity. At the N-terminus, residues
12–26 contain a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal
(NLS) (12-GRRRDFSGRSSAKKK-26)
(Figure A), consistent with PIR1 nuclear localization. The C-terminus of the DSP domain is a long noncatalytic
extension (residues 206–330) that contains two short predicted
helices (h10 and h11) between residues 235–240 and 263–270
(Figure A). This C-terminal extension is not
required for RNA 5′-phosphatase activity, and its deletion
enhances PIR1 phosphatase activity in vitro.

Domain organization and stability of human PIR1. (A) Schematic
diagram of the PIR1 domain organization and deletion constructs generated
in this study. The DSP domain (residues 66–205) is colored
gray and flanked by an N-terminal putative NLS and two predicted C-terminal
α-helices (h10 and h11) (colored red). (B) Thermal denaturation
of PIR1-C152S-coreFED monitored by measuring temperature-induced
CD changes in ellipticity at 222 nm. PIR1-C152S-coreFED unfolded irreversibly with an appTm of ∼56.7 °C.

Aiming at structural studies, we generated several PIR1 constructs
lacking the N-terminal putative NLS and containing various deletions
of the C-terminal noncatalytic extension. We found that a construct
encompassing residues 29–205 (termed PIR1-core) and a slightly
longer construct containing a C-terminal “FED” motif
(PIR1-coreFED, residues 29–222) had the highest
solubility in vitro (Figure A). However, because of its in vivo toxicity, it
was difficult to purify large quantities of catalytically active PIR1-core
for structural studies. Replacing the active site C152 with a serine
reduced in vivo toxicity and yielded a protein less
aggregation-prone in vitro. Circular dichroism (CD)
spectra of PIR1-C152S-coreFED recorded at pH 7.4 were consistent
with a folded protein containing a mixture of α-helices and
β-stands and &lt;30% of its residues in a random coil conformation
(Figure S1 of the ). To determine the structural stability of PIR1-C152S-coreFED, we measured heat-induced denaturation by monitoring variations
in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature (Figure B). PIR1-C152S-coreFED unfolded irreversibly
in a highly cooperative manner, with an apparent melting temperature
(appTm) of ∼56.7 °C,
comparable to that of VH1 (appTm ∼ 60 °C) but significantly
lower than that of the DUSP26 catalytic core (appTm ∼ 68 °C). An identical appTm was measured
for PIR1-C152S-core (Figure S2 of the ), suggesting that the C-terminal extension spanning
residues 206–222 does not affect protein stability. Thus, PIR1-core
adopts a folded and stable conformation suitable for structural analysis.

Atomic Structure of the PIR1 Catalytic Core
We crystallized
PIR1-C152S-coreFED and PIR1-C152-core over a wide range
of pH values between 5.5 and 8.5. At a lower pH, PIR1-C152S-coreFED yielded cubic crystals containing a monomer in the asymmetric
unit that diffracted to ∼1.85 Å resolution. In contrast,
PIR1-C152S-core crystallized as a trimer in a primitive orthorhombic
space group, and the best crystals diffracted past 1.20 Å resolution.
We determined both crystal forms by molecular replacement using BVP
as a search model and refined PIR1-C152S-coreFED to Rwork and Rfree values
of 16.85 and 18.75%, respectively, at 1.85 Å resolution and PIR1-C152S-core
to Rwork and Rfree values of 13.73 and 16.99%, respectively, at 1.20 Å resolution
(Table ). The structures of the two PIR1 constructs
are essentially identical (rmsd of ∼0.32 Å) (Figure S3
of the ), and because
there is no evidence of PIR1 oligomerization in solution, the trimeric
arrangement seen in the orthorhombic crystal form may reflect a crystallization
artifact. In this paper, we will refer to the structure of PIR1-C152S-core,
which was refined to 1.20 Å resolution (Figure A), for structural analysis and comparison to other DSPs.

The active site phosphate and chloride ions are colored orange and
yellow, respectively. (B) Topological diagram of PIR1-C152S-core.
The central β-sheet formed by strands β1−β5
is highlighted with a light blue background. Insertion elements not
found in VH1 are colored red. (C) Superimposition of PIR1-S152C-core
(cyan) and VH1 (gray) with helices shown as cylinders (for the sake
of clarity, the VH1 N-terminal helix spanning residues 1–20
was omitted). Colored red are the structural elements that render
the PIR1 catalytic cleft significantly deeper than in VH1.

PIR1-C152S-core is built by a quasi-globular cysteine-phosphatase
domain of 45 Å × 45 Å × 60 Å, with N- and
C-termini projecting in opposite directions (Figure A). The phosphatase core consists of a central five-stranded
β-sheet (β1−β5) (highlighted with a light
blue background in Figure B) sandwiched between
two clusters of five (h1–h5) and four (h6–h9) helices
that make contacts with the solvent (Figure B). A search using the Dali server identified
baculovirus BVP (PDB entry 1YN9) and the RNA 5′-phosphatase
domain of the mouse mRNA capping enzyme (PDB entry 1I9S) as the phosphatases that were most structurally similar
to PIR1-core (rmsds of 1.4 and 1.5 Å, respectively). PIR1-C152S-core
can also be superimposed on VH1 (PDB entry 3CM3) (Figure C) and
VHR (PDB entry 1VHR) with rmsds of 2.5 and 2.2 Å, respectively, but presents four
noticeable differences from the classical VH1-like DSP-core (colored
red in Figure B,C). First, it contains an
N-terminal extension upstream of the DSP-core (residues 29–40),
partially folded into a 3/10 helix (h1) (Figure B,C). Second, a helical hairpin containing helices h2 and h3 inserts
between strand β2 and helix h4 of the PIR1 phosphatase core,
forcing helix h4 to adopt a position orthogonal to its counterpart
in VH1 (Figure B,C). Third, the PIR1 “WPD
loop” (or “general acid loop”, residues 116–122)
is two residues shorter than in most phosphoprotein phosphatases. Fourth, the loop connecting stands β3
and β4 (known as the “E-loop”, residues 96–101)
is significantly longer than in VH1 and folds into a 3/10 helix (h5)
between residues 102 and 104 (Figure B,C).
Together, these subtle variations on the classical DSP fold affect
the PIR1 active site conformation and, potentially, substrate specificity.
Most noticeably, the PIR1 N-terminal extension packs against the insertion
hairpin and makes contacts with the E-loop, surrounding the P-loop
(Figure A,C). This generates a remarkably
wider and deeper (Figure A,D) active site
cleft than in VH1 (Figure C,F). The PIR1 active site crevice is also deeper
than in BVP (Figure B,E), mainly because of the conformation adopted by the E-loop,
which faces inward in PIR1 and projects outward in BVP. PIR1 catalytic
residue C152 (S152 in our structure) sits at the bottom of this deep
crevice, buried ∼10 Å below the enzyme surface: the calculated
SAS area for C152 is ∼1.45 Å2, significantly
smaller than that of C119 in BVP (∼2.18 Å2)
or C110 in VH1 (∼1.61 Å2).

Depth of the PIR1 catalytic
cleft. Surface representations of (A)
human PIR1-C152S-core, (B) baculovirus BVP (PDB entry 1YN9), and (C) Vaccinia virus monomeric VH1 (PDB entry 3CM3) reveal striking
differences in the width of the active site pocket. Magnified cut-through
views of (D) PIR1, (E) BVP, and (F) VH1 catalytic pockets reveal differences
in the depth of the active site crevice.

PIR1 Active Site Residues
The 1.20 Å structure
of PIR1-C152S-core, the highest resolution ever achieved for a human
dual-specificity phosphatase, provides a detailed view of the enzyme
active site (Figure A). The PIR1 catalytic
cysteine, C152 (replaced with a serine in our structure), and the
general base R158 are part of a P-loop that can be structurally superimposed
with the P-loop of VH1-related DSPs. The
invariant arginine, R158, is 4.6 Å from the C152 sulfur atom,
slightly closer than in VH1, where this distance is 5.1 Å. Unlike
classical PTPs and most DSPs, PIR1 does not contain a general acid,
which is usually located on a separate loop (the general acid loop),
near the top of the active site. Furthermore,
the PIR1 active site is occupied by two ions. The first ion, a phosphate
as in VH1 or DUSP27, resembles the γ-phosphate of RNA and makes close
contacts with main chain atoms of P-loop residues 153–158 and
the side chains of S152, H154, N157, and R158 (Figure A). The second ion, a chloride (termed “active site
Cl” or ClAS) is visible as an ∼8σ peak
of positive electron density in an Fo – Fc difference map (Figure A). ClAS is coordinated by the side chain atoms of T96,
R158, and T153, as well as the backbone atoms of T96 and Y95 and a
water molecule (Figure B). The approximate
distance between PIR1 atoms and ClAS is 3.2 Å, in
good agreement with the distance expected for a chloride atom interacting
with a protein, given a van der Waals radius of 1.81 Å. Although ClAS is only 6 Å from
the phosphate ion, the two ions interact only indirectly through the
guanidinium group of R158. The refined B factor of
ClAS is only 14.1 Å2, comparable to that
of the active site phosphate (∼15.4 Å2) but
significantly lower than the B factors of both protein
(∼22.5 Å2) and solvent (∼38.1 Å2) atoms (Table ). To rule out the
possibility that ClAS represents an artifact of crystallization
resulting from the presence of 200 mM NaCl in the protein buffer,
we also determined a 2.2 Å crystal structure of PIR1-C152S-core
crystallized in only 35 mM NaCl, the lowest salt concentration at
which PIR1 yields crystals (Figure S4 of the ). Despite an ∼6-fold lower NaCl concentration
(35 mM vs 200 mM), an identical peak of density corresponding to ClAS was observed in the electron density, suggesting this metal
ion binds specifically to the PIR1 active site in a dedicated binding
pocket (Figure B).

Docking a Ribonucleotide inside the PIR1 Catalytic Pocket
Attempts to cocrystallize PIR1-core with polyribonucleotides were
unsuccessful. Addition of 5 mM AMP (also a ribonucleotide) to PIR1-S152-coreFED during crystallization enhanced the crystal size and reproducibility,
but no density for this ribonucleotide was observed in the final electron
density. We then attempted in silico docking of ATP
and ADP into the PIR1-S152C-core crystal structure using AutoDock
Vina. This program readily placed the
triphosphate tail of ATP inside the PIR1 positively charged crevice
(Figure A), forcing the triphosphate backbone
negative charge to be neutralized by PIR1 (Figure B). A comparable docking model was also obtained using HADDOCK, which uses structural constraints from the phosphate
ion observed crystallographically to model the position of the γ-phosphate
of ATP. The predicted free energy for binding of ATP to PIR1-core
(ΔGbind) was −7.0 kcal/mol,
slightly higher than that of ADP (−6.6 kcal/mol). In this model,
the ATP triphosphate tail, ∼10 Å in length, fits perfectly
inside the PIR1 catalytic pocket, while the nucleobase (an adenine)
faces the catalytic cleft, making contacts with residues in the WPD
loop (Figure A,B). Interestingly, this model
predicts that the position of RNA in the catalytic cleft is compatible
with the presence of ClAS (Figure B), which is not likely displaced during catalysis. The high degree
of electrostatic complementarity between the PIR1 basic surface (blue
in Figure A,B) and the negative charge of
RNA is likely to play a pivotal role in molecular recognition.

Structure-Based Site-Directed Mutagenesis
The high-resolution
structure of PIR1-C152S-core bound to phosphate (Figure A) and the docking model in Figure  revealed two distinctive features of PIR1 substrate recognition.
First, the nonaliphatic side chains of P-loop residues H154 and N157
make close contacts with the active site phosphate: H154 nitrogen
atom ND1 and N157 carboxamide are only ∼2.7 Å from the
phosphate O3 atom (Figure A). These close
contacts are not commonly seen in DSPs that dephosphorylate phosphoprotein
monoesters, where the P-loop is usually occupied by small side chain-bearing
amino acids. Second, residues R192 and
H119 of PIR1 (Figure C) are positioned &lt;3.0
Å from the β-phosphate of RNA and possibly involved in
β-phosphatase activity. Interestingly, these residues (H119
and R192) are conserved in BVP, also a β-phosphatase, where
H119 is replaced with a glutamine (Q88 and R159, respectively), but
are missing in the RNA phosphatase domain of the mouse (PDB entry 1I9S) and human (PDB
entry 2C46)
mRNA capping enzyme, which lack β-phosphatase activity and have
a glycine and a lysine at equivalent positions (G95 and K166, respectively).
To test the role of these residues in PIR1 catalytic activity, we
generated five mutants of PIR1-coreFED carrying H154A,
N157A, H154A/N157A (DM), R192K, and H119G substitutions. All mutants
were expressed and purified under identical conditions, and their
phosphatase activity was measured in vitro using
PIR1-C152-coreFED and PIR1-C152S-coreFED as
positive and negative controls, respectively. To determine if mutations
preferentially affected PIR1 triphosphatase versus diphosphatase activity,
all mutants were incubated with ATP and ADP and hydrolyzed phosphate
was quantified with Malachite green reagent (Figure A). This assay revealed that removing
the side chains of H154 and N157, as well as combining the two mutations
(DM), dramatically disrupted phosphatase activity: all P-loop mutants
were catalytically inactive in vitro, like PIR1-C152S-core
(Figure A). Alanine substitution of H154 and
N157 disrupted phosphatase activity irrespective of the phospho-substrate
used in the assay (ATP or ADP), suggesting an essential role in catalysis.
In contrast, replacing R192 with a lysine (to mimic the mRNA capping
enzyme) reduced the level of hydrolysis of ADP β-phosphate by
80% while the level of ATP dephosphorylation was only halved (Figure A). Finally, mutating H119 to glycine had no impact
on phosphatase activity under our experimental conditions, being the
quantity of inorganic phosphate released by PIR1-H119G-coreFED comparable to that of wild-type PIR1-coreFED (Figure A).

all the kinetic parameters measured in this experiment.

To determine if P-loop mutations at H154 and N157
affect Km (substrate binding) or kcat/Km (catalytic
efficiency),
we also set up an in vitro dephosphorylation assay
using the phosphatase substrate OMFP (Figure B). We found that alanine mutations at H154 and N157 minimally affected
PIR1’s affinity for OMFP (&lt;1.5-fold increase in Km) but reduced the kcat/Km by 3.5–7.5-fold relative to
that of PIR1-C152-core (Table ). Together,
these data suggest that the nonaliphatic side chains of H154 and N157
play an important role in phosphatase activity and, when mutated to
alanine, PIR1 is still able to bind substrate molecules with high
affinity, but the enzyme–substrate complex converts a smaller
proportion of bound substrate into product.

Discussion
Dual-specificity phosphatases are important signaling enzymes whose
misregulation is intimately linked to cancer, diabetes, inflammation,
and Alzheimer’s disease. Inhibiting
DSPs is emerging as a potential therapeutic strategy in pharmacology. In particular, significant interest is devoted
to understanding how the well-conserved and apparently simple PTP
fold accounts for the remarkable substrate specificity present in
a cell and governing signaling pathways. Knowledge of molecular determinants
involved in substrate recognition is essential to the development
of potent and specific phosphatase inhibitors. For classical PTPs
and DSPs that hydrolyze phospho-amino acids, the depth of the active
site pocket has been identified as a key determinant in substrate
specificity.− High-resolution structures of human VHR, VHZ,Vaccinia virus VH1,, and many other VH1-like phosphatases
have revealed a shallow active site pocket (∼6 Å in depth).
Less is known about atypical DSPs that
dephosphorylate highly diverse, nonpeptidic substrates such as carbohydrates, lipids, and RNA. The 1.20 Å crystal structure of PIR1-core
presented in this paper sheds light on novel and conserved structural
features of a human RNA 5′-phosphatase.

Design Principles of a
VH1-like RNA 5′-Phosphatase
The atomic structure of
PIR1-core suggests that specificity for
RNA is conferred by at least three distinct structural determinants.
First, subtle variations of the VH1 fold (Figure B,C) render the PIR1-core active site remarkably wide and
deep. An N-terminal extension (residues 29–40) common to RNA
5′-phosphatases that bear an amino-proximal DSP domain packs
against the insertion hairpin (h2–h3) and makes contact with
the top of the E-loop (β3−β4 loop), surrounding
the P-loop (Figure C). A shorter acidic loop
lacking a general acid (Glu or Asp) exerts reduced steric hindrance
on the active site, making the PIR1 active site crevice both wider
and deeper than in DSPs specific to peptidic substrates (Figure A,D). Both the
helical hairpin and the N-terminal extension are also present in BVP and the human mRNA capping enzyme and thus represent general features of RNA 5′-phosphatases.
Second, two residues in PIR1 P-loop, H154 and N157, make close side
chain contacts with the active site phosphate (postulated to exemplify
RNA γ-phosphate), stabilizing this ion in the deep active site
pocket (Figure A). The imidazole group of
H154 located two positions C-terminal of the catalytic cysteine makes
close contacts with the phosphate O3 atom, which is also contacted
by N157. The nonaliphatic side chains of P-loop residues H154 and
N157 are strictly conserved in other RNA 5′-phosphatases like
BVP and the mRNA capping enzyme, and substitution with alanine disrupts
phosphatase activity (Figure A,B).,, Thus, as suggested by Changela
et al., the P-loop signature sequence
of RNA 5′-phosphatases is HCXHXXNR(S/T). Third, the PIR1
active site contains an active site Cl ion that stabilizes the position
of the general base R158 and makes contact with P-loop T153, immediately
next to the catalytic cysteine (Figure B).
Interestingly, a phosphate ion occupies an equivalent position in
BVP (Figure B,E),
suggesting that the presence of a second active site anion may represent
a conserved feature of RNA 5′-phosphatases.

Structural
Basis for RNA γ- and β-Phosphatase Activity
Phospho-monoesterase
reactions catalyzed by classical PTPs and
most DSPs proceed via the formation of a covalent enzyme–phospho-substrate
intermediate, where the initial Cys attack benefits from protonation
of the bridging oxygen leaving group by a general acid (such as Asp).
Instead, cleavage of phosphoanhydrides by RNA-specific cysteine phosphatases
like BVP, the mRNA capping enzyme, and PIR1 does not require a general
acid residue, possibly because of the low pKa of the leaving group., The docking study presented
in this paper suggests a perfect complementarity between the PIR1
deep catalytic cleft and the triphosphate tail of RNA. The high degree
of electrostatic complementarity between the PIR1 basic surface (Figure A,B) and the negatively charged RNA backbone likely
promotes insertion of the RNA 5′-end inside the PIR1 active
site. The docked conformation of ATP brings the γ-phosphate
within 3 Å of the catalytic cysteine, in a conformation suitable
for phosphate hydrolysis (Figure C). On the
basis of this model, we speculate that the PIR1 catalytic pocket is
not likely to undergo substrate-induced conformational changes to
hydrolyze the γ-phosphate of RNA. Our docking model, however,
does not explain how PIR1 can dephosphorylate the β-phosphate
of RNA, which is ∼6 Å from C152, likely too far for the
catalytic cysteine, postulated to exist as a thiolate in the ground
state, to make a nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, analogous to BVP, β-phosphate
hydrolysis by PIR1 proceeds efficiently in the absence of γ-phosphate,
arguing against a model in which the Cys−γ-Pi intermediate functions as the nucleophile that attacks the β-phosphorus
of an RNA substrate. It is possible that the PIR1 catalytic pocket
undergoes a conformational change to hydrolyze the β-phosphate
of RNA. Analogous to classical DSPs that are thought to shrink their
active site pocket to accommodate phospho-substrates with different
steric hindrance, a conformational change
in PIR1 would facilitate β-phosphate hydrolysis. In this respect,
we identified R192 as a putative residue in PIR1 that is important
for diphosphatase activity: a conservative mutation of R192 to lysine
(as found in the mRNA capping enzyme that lacks β-phosphatase
activity) reduced the level of ADP hydrolysis
by ∼80%, while ATP γ-phosphate hydrolysis was affected
by only 50% (Figure A).

In conclusion,
we have described the structural organization of the human PIR1 catalytic
core. This work is a step forward in the molecular characterization
of atypical DSPs that dephosphorylate nonpeptidic substrates. Future
studies will have to identify additional residues outside the PIR1
P-loop that take part in β-phosphate stabilization and facilitate
its hydrolysis as well as address how the PIR1 noncatalytic C-terminal
extension (residues 206–330) affects enzymatic activity, likely by regulating association with RNA and
other important physiological binding partners.
