G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) make up
the largest superfamily
of eukaryotic integral membrane proteins. Despite their diversity, a common mechanism involving
a class of GPCR kinases (GRKs) regulates their desensitization., Termination of GPCR signaling is caused by receptor phosphorylation
at intracellular Ser or Thr residues, followed by arrestin binding
that blocks the interaction between activated GPCRs and G proteins.
Recent studies have suggested that individual GRKs contribute differently
to the phosphorylation of a given GPCR, and that a distinct pattern
of phosphorylation established by each GRK may trigger distinct signaling
events.− Determining the pattern of GPCR phosphorylation by each GRK is therefore
important, as these signaling mechanisms are potential pharmacological
targets. Although mapping phosphorylation sites on various GPCRs has
been reported using in vivo and in vitro methods,− inherent complexities have made it difficult to map the phospho-acceptor
residues used by individual GRKs.− Overexpressed receptors
in the in vivo assays can differ from endogenous
receptors, as GRK regulation of
GPCRs is likely to vary between cell and tissue types and GPCRs can
be phosphorylated by other Ser/Thr kinases. In vitro GRK phosphorylation assays usually need to be executed on a GPCR
embedded in a lipid bilayer, as lipid–GRK interactions are
typically required for GRK function., However, the
GPCR oligomeric state and topology of insertion cannot
be controlled with most methods. A detergent-free
environment is also typically required,
as GRK activity can be inhibited by detergents.

Neurotensin (NTS) is a 13-residue neuropeptide with diverse biological activities, ranging
from cancer
growth to Parkinson’s disease. Most effects of NTS are mediated by NTS receptor
1 (NTSR1),
a class A GPCR. Although the mechanism
of desensitization of NTSR1 by
binding of arrestin to phosphorylated NTSR1 in HEK293 and COS7 cells
was demonstrated,− these studies could not identify the specific residues
phosphorylated or the GRKs responsible for that phosphorylation. Therefore,
we designed this study to identify GRK-specific phosphorylation of
NTSR1 in vitro under well-controlled conditions offered
by nanodisc technology. One advantage of using GPCRs incorporated
into nanodiscs with respect to GRK function is that the nanodisc lipid
bilayer offers a platform by which GRK–lipid interactions required
for GRK activity can be preserved− while maintaining a nativelike
lipid environment
for the receptor., Using a combination of studies
of receptor mutants and liquid chromatography
followed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MC),, this
method allows for identification of the phosphorylation pattern
provided by each GRK and offers insight into the complexity of these
physiological reactions. Here we report the unique phosphorylation
of NTSR1 by GRK2 and GRK5, which belong to the GRK2 and GRK4 subfamilies,
respectively. We found that (i) GRK2 showed agonist-dependent phosphorylation
whereas GRK5 showed activation-independent phosphorylation, (ii) the
negatively charged lipids in the vicinity of the receptor are required
for phosphorylation, and (iii) GRK2 and GRK5 produced different phosphorylation
patterns. In addition, we demonstrated that the activity of GRK2 did
not require acidic residues upstream of the phospho-acceptors, in
contrast to the β2-adrenergic (β2AR) and μ-opioid (μOP) receptors.

{2-[(1-(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)-5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)pyrazol-3-yl)carbonylamino]tricyclo(3.3.1.1.3.7)decan-2-carboxylic
acid} was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-1′-rac-glycerol
(POPG) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Tobacco
etch virus (TEV) protease mutant His-TEV(S219V)-Arg was prepared as
previously reported. The expression and
purification of MSP1E3D1 were performed
as described in the .

Preparation of NTSR1 Embedded in Nanodiscs
The NTSR1
wild type (WT) and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins (NTSR1f) consisting of the E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP), followed by a TEV
protease recognition site, the rat NTSR1 (the N-terminally truncated
rat NTSR1 starting at Thr43), a second TEV protease recognition site
at the receptor C-terminus, followed by E. coli thioredoxin
(TrxA), and a decahistidine (H10) tag, and purified as described previously. Nanodisc reconstitutions were conducted as previously
reported with modification., A brief description

using a common procedure consisting of Ni-NTA affinity, followed by
Source15S cation exchange, and tandem S200 size exclusion chromatography
as previously described.− The purity of each GRK variant was judged by sodium

Sedimentation Velocity
Analytical Ultracentrifugation
Sedimentation velocity analytical
ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) was
performed to characterize the nanodisc preparations and establish
the receptor and scaffold protein to lipid stoichiometry as described
in the .

Radiolabeled
Ligand Binding Assay
NTSR1f nanodiscs were treated
with TEV protease prior to ligand binding
experiments, to cleave off the MBP and TrxA-H10 fusion proteins and
generate NTSR1 with near authentic N- and C-termini (see reconstitution
and purification of NTSR1f nanodiscs in the ). Single-point ligand
binding experiments and saturation binding experiments were conducted
as described previously. The Kd values were unchanged
except for that of WT in 100% POPC nanodiscs. Therefore, the amount
of specifically bound [3H]NTS was corrected
for fractional occupancy using a Kd of
1.0 nM for NTSR1 WT in 100% POPC nanodisc and a Kd of 0.5 ± 0.2 nM for all other cases.

Phosphorylation
Assay
Because of aggregation and loss
of material during concentration and dialysis, NTSR1f nanodiscs
were used without further treatment in the elution buffer containing
50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, and 200 mM imidazole. Phosphorylation
assays were conducted as described previously with slight modifications. Briefly, NTSR1 nanodiscs with various
POPC:POPG ratios were phosphorylated in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mM
MgCl2, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 40 mM NaCl, and 40 mM imidazole
(final concentration) for 10 min at 30 °C. Analytical reactions
were conducted using 95 nM receptor and 310 nM GRK2 or 350 nM GRK5
in a volume of 20 μL with [γ-32P]ATP (final
specific activity of 500–1000 cpm/pmol) in the absence of ligand
and in the presence of NTS (60
nM) or SR48692 (60 nM) and stopped by the addition of 7 μL of
NuPage 4×LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and the mixtures
were resolved via SDS–PAGE (NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gel,
1× MES running buffer, Invitrogen). Gels were
stained with SimplyBlue SafeStain (Invitrogen), dried, and exposed
to X-ray film (Kodak Bio XAR Film, Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 14–17
h. NTSR1 bands were then excised, and the radioactivity
was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. Means ± the
standard deviation (SD, error bars) from two experiments performed
in duplicate are shown.
The data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with a Dunnett test or two-way ANOVA with a Holm-Šídák
test for multiple comparisons in GraphPad Prism (version 6.05, GraphPad
Software).

Identification of Phosphorylated Amino Acids
by Mass Spectrometry
NTSR1 in nanodiscs prepared using 75%
POPC and 25% POPG were phosphorylated
by GRKs in a volume of 200–250
μL, as described in the previous section, except
for the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Two 10 μL aliquots
were treated with [γ-32P]ATP and incubated
in parallel to confirm the phosphorylation stoichiometry. After separation
of the sample by SDS–PAGE and staining of the gel, the bands
of interest were excised. The following steps were performed by the
Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA). The excised bands were subjected to in-gel digestion
with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Phosphopeptides were separated by in-house
packed C18 reverse phase HPLC columns (25–30 cm in length with
an internal diameter of 100 μm, Accucore
beads with a 2.6 μm diameter). Peptide sequencing analysis was
performed by the LTQ-Orbitrap-Pro mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Inc.). The LC/MS/MS data were searched against the sequence
of NTSR1. The TMSFcore based on Ascore algorithm was used on the internal
server of the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility to determine
whether the phosphorylation could be confidently assigned to a specific
residue. The Ascore algorithm is a probability-based score that measures
the probability of correct phosphorylation site localization based
on the presence and the intensity of site-determining ions in the
phosphopeptide MS/MS spectra. Phosphopeptides
with an Ascore greater than or equal
to 19 always produced &gt;99% certainty, and those with an Ascore
of 15–19 produced a &gt;90% success rate. These were used for
the identification
of phosphorylation sites.

Results
NTSR1f Is Monomeric in Nanodiscs
We utilized
a zwitterionic POPC and monovalent negatively charged POPG for NTSR1
nanodisc reconstitutions. Both POPC and POPG have a phase transition
temperature below 0 °C,, and a cylindrical molecular
shape. Although POPG is a minor constituent
in eukaryotic membranes, it was chosen
instead of the more abundant 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine because the latter
has a higher transition temperature of 14 °C. All reconstitution experiments were conducted at 4 °C
or on ice, to preserve NTSR1 activity and remain above the phase transition
temperatures of POPC and POPG. Nanodisc reconstitution was performed
using NTSR1f, POPC along with 0–50% of POPG, and
MSP1E3D1. The NTSR1f nanodiscs were characterized
by SV-AUC to establish their biophysical properties, receptor stoichiometry,
and protein:lipid stoichiometry., SV-AUC experiments
showed the presence of a major species at 6.6–7.0 S, representing
35–50%
of the loading absorbance ( and ). We noted that the sedimentation coefficient increases slightly
with an increasing POPG content, reflecting in part the smaller partial
specific volume of POPG. The best-fit
frictional ratios f/f0 of ∼1.3 were consistent with the expected globular
shape of the receptor–nanodisc assembly. An analysis of the
absorbance and interference signal intensities for the major species
leads to a lipid stoichiometry of 120–150 molecules per receptor,
confirming the presence of one NTSR1f and two MSP1E3D1
molecules per receptor–nanodisc assembly.
Simple volume and shape calculations yielded an expected sedimentation
coefficient of ∼6.8 S for a receptor in nanodiscs having a
150:2:1 lipid:MSP1E3D1:NTSR1f stoichiometry. The same analysis
was performed for empty nanodiscs (Table S1 and Figure S1 of the ). It revealed 190–220
phospholipid molecules per nanodisc, confirming the presence of
two MSP1E3D1 molecules per empty nanodisc. On the basis of the experimentally
determined lipid stoichiometries, monomeric NTSR1f in MSP1E3D1
nanodiscs displaces ∼65–70 phospholipid molecules, in
close agreement with observations made
for MSP1D1 nanodiscs containing one receptor.,

GRK2 Shows Agonist-Dependent Phosphorylation, but GRK5 Also
Phosphorylates Inactive NTSR1
We first tested the effects
of lipid and ligand on monomeric NTSR1 phosphorylation by GRK2 and
GRK5. NTSR1f nanodiscs were treated with TEV protease to
generate NTSR1 with near authentic N- and C-termini (A). This preparation was assayed for phosphorylation in the absence
of ligand, in the presence of NTS, and with added antagonist SR48692 (B,C). In the case of GRK2, only agonist-activated NTSR1 was
phosphorylated
to yield ∼4–5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor in the
presence of either 25 or
50% POPG. In contrast, GRK5 phosphorylated NTSR1 with the same yield
as GRK2 in the presence of POPG, but in an activation-independent
manner. GRK5 has a highly basic region in the C-terminal domain, allowing
it to bind phospholipid surfaces. However,
soluble GRK2 is thought to interact with Gβγ, to facilitate binding to the membrane. To test whether membrane
association affected phosphorylation by GRK2, NTSR1 phosphorylation
by GRK2 was tested in the presence of Gβ1γ1, an isoform that was shown to interact with NTSR1 in combination
with Gαq, and that can be purified
in the absence of detergent,
unlike Gβ1γ2. We observed no clear effect of Gβ1γ1 on GRK2 activity toward agonist-activated NTSR1 embedded
in 75% POPC/25% POPG nanodiscs
when Gβ1γ1 was titrated with agonist-activated
NTSR1/GRK2 mixtures, even at high ratios of Gβ1γ1 to GRK2 (Figure S2 of the ). This result also shows that activation-independent
phosphorylation by GRK5 may not depend on its constitutive membrane
association and may in fact reflect the inherent functional properties
of GRK5 as observed for the dopamine D1 receptor, β2AR, and M2 muscarinic receptor.

NTSR1 phosphorylation by GRK2 and GRK5. (A) NTSR1f nanodiscs
were treated with TEV protease to remove the N-terminal maltose-binding
protein (MBP) and C-terminal E. coli thioredoxin-decahistidine
(TrxA-H10) tail. NTSR1 nanodiscs were then phosphorylated by GRKs
in the presence or absence of ligand. (B) Phosphorylation of NTSR1
by GRK2 and GRK5. Monomeric NTSR1 embedded in nanodiscs prepared using
MSP1E3D1 and a 75% POPC/25% POPG mixture (95 nM) was phosphorylated
by GRK2 (310 nM) and GRK5 (350 nM) in the absence of ligand (-L) or
in the presence of agonist (neurotensin; NTS) or antagonist (SR48692;
SR), as described in , and then resolved by SDS–PAGE (left). The gel was stained
with SimplyBlue SafeStain, dried, and then exposed to X-ray film for
14 h (right). (C) NTSR1 nanodiscs prepared with various lipid mixtures
were phosphorylated with GRK2 and GRK5 in the absence of ligand or
in the presence of agonist NTS or antagonist SR48692. The stoichiometry
of phosphorylation was determined, as described in . Means ± SD (error bars) from two
experiments performed in duplicate are shown. **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, and ****p &lt; 0.0001 compared with WT (two-way ANOVA followed by a Holm-Šídák
test).

To investigate the effect of negatively
charged
lipids, we conducted phosphorylation studies of agonist-activated
NTSR1 using nanodiscs containing varying amounts of POPG (). The level of phosphorylation
increased with an increasing level of POPG, up to 20%, and subsequently
remained constant up to 50% POPG. The results indicate that negatively
charged lipids in the vicinity of the receptor are required for phosphorylation
by GRK2 and GRK5. On the basis of these observations, along with the
negatively charged phospholipid headgroup composition of the plasma
membrane (∼24%, mol % of total phosphate), NTSR1 was reconstituted into 75% POPC/25% POPG nanodiscs
for subsequent studies.

Negatively charged lipids promote phosphorylation
of NTSR1 by GRK2
and GRK5. NTS-bound NTSR1 in nanodiscs prepared using POPC with the
indicated fractions of POPG was phosphorylated by GRK2 (●)
or GRK5 (□), and the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was determined
as described in . Means
± SD from two experiments performed in duplicate are shown.

GRK2 and GRK5 Target Different
Residues on Activated NTSR1
GRKs preferentially phosphorylate
Ser/Thr residues located in the
C-terminal tail and/or intracellular loops of GPCRs.,, In the case of NTSR1, two Ser/Thr
clusters within the C-terminal
tail [cluster 1 (C1), S407, S409, and S410; cluster 2 (C2), S415,
T416, and S417] have been proposed as GRK phosphorylation sites. We constructed three cluster mutants, C1A (S407A,
S409A,
and S410A), C2A (S415A, T416A, and S417A), and C1A/C2A (S407A, S409A,
S410A, S415A, T416A, and S417A) (A), and reconstituted these mutants into
75% POPC/25% POPG nanodiscs to test agonist-activated phosphorylation
of NTSR1 by GRK2 or GRK5 (B). In the case of GRK2, the C1A and C2A mutants showed
a diminished level of phosphorylation with 2.1 and 1.2 mol of phosphate/mol
of receptor, respectively. The C1A/C2A mutant was not significantly
phosphorylated. Similar observations were made using GRK5, with the
C1A, C2A, and C1A/C2A mutants leading to 3.2, 2.0, and 1.1 mol of
phosphate/mol of receptor, respectively. These results suggest that
clusters C1 and C2 are phosphate acceptors for both GRK2 and GRK5 in vitro, as previously reported in vivo, and that GRK5 phosphorylates at least
one site outside
of clusters C1 and C2.

Phosphorylation of NTSR1 mutants by GRKs. (A) The C-terminus
of
NTSR1 contains two Ser/Thr clusters, C1 (S407, S409, and S410) and
C2 (S415, T416, and S417). Ser and Thr residues in these clusters
were all mutated to Ala to make C1A and C2A. (B) NTS-bound NTSR1 WT
and cluster mutants, C1A, C2A, and C1A/C2A, embedded in 75% POPC/25%
POPG nanodiscs, were phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK5, and the stoichiometry
of phosphorylation was determined as described in . Means ± SD from two experiments
performed in duplicate are shown. *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, and ****p &lt; 0.001 compared
with WT (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test).

Because we cannot rule out the possibility that
these cluster mutations may influence protein function and/or structure
resulting in phosphorylation artifacts, we directly identified phosphorylated residues in NTSR1
WT by LC/MS/MS ( and Figure S3 and Table S2 of the ). In the case of GRK2, we identified residues S407
in C1 and S415 in C2 as the principal phosphorylation targets. In
contrast, treatment with GRK5 resulted in 12 phosphorylation sites:
four residues within IL3 (T279,
T282, T290, and T294)
and eight residues on the C-terminal tail, including C1 and C2 (S402,
S407, S409, S410, S415, T416, S417, and T419). This demonstrates that
GRK2 and GRK5 catalyze the formation of distinct phosphorylation patterns
on NTSR1.

Mapping of phosphorylation sites on NTSR1 WT phosphorylated by
GRKs. NTS-bound NTSR1 in 75% POPC/25% POPG nanodiscs was phosphorylated
by GRKs and then analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Spectra were analyzed using
the Ascore algorithm. (A) The square indicates the region of the NTSR1
depicted in panels B and C. Mapping of positions phosphorylated by
(B) GRK2 and (C) GRK5. Residues that have &gt;99 and 90% success rates
with Ascores of ≥19 and 15–19 are colored red and green,
respectively. The amino acid residues at the N- and C-termini derived
from the TEV cleavage sites and a spacer are colored gray.

Even though nanodiscs expose the extra- and intracellular
surfaces of the receptor for both the interacting partner protein
and ligand, GRK2 and GRK5 phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues located
only at the intracellular region of the receptor. It is therefore
presumed that specific sequences on NTSR1 provide recognition targets
for the GRKs. Earlier studies have shown that GRK2 actively phosphorylates
Ser/Thr near acidic residues,,, and that GRK5 prefers a nonacidic peptide as its substrate. The GRK2 substrates β2AR and
μOP
both have pairs of acidic residues (Asp and Glu) near their phospho-acceptor
sites, (A). Interestingly, the relative position of the charged
amino acid residues near the C-terminal Ser/Thr residues of NTSR1
is distinct, in that there are positively charged clusters (residues
392–398, 403,
and 404) rather than pairs of acidic residues. To elucidate whether
GRKs
recognize particular residues near the phospho-acceptor site, we tested
the activity of GRKs using NTSR1 variants in which two adjacent basic
amino acid residues were mutated to neutral Ala or the negatively
charged Glu. These NTSR1 mutants were reconstituted into 75% POPC/25%
POPG nanodiscs and then activated by agonist binding for phosphorylation
assays. As shown in B, all mutants behaved much like WT with respect to GRK2 activity,
indicating that GRK2 is not influenced by these residues. That is,
site-specific phosphorylation of NTSR1 by GRK2 does not require acidic
residues near phospho-acceptor sites, in contrast to β2AR and μOP. In the case of GRK5, all mutants except for R403E/K404E
also showed
the same behavior as WT. For unknown reasons, the R403E/K404E mutant
exhibited nonphysiological phosphorylation of the extracellular part
of the receptor by LS/MS/MS
analysis (data not shown). Although we did not identify a motif for
site-specific GRK phosphorylation for NTSR1, these results indicate
that the GRKs distinguish the specific phospho-acceptor sites of the
receptor in vitro.

efficiency of NTSR1 WT and double mutants by GRK2. Agonist-activated
NTSR1 double mutants (AA or EE) in 75% POPC/25% POPG nanodiscs were

Discussion
GPCR desensitization is initiated by phosphorylation
of its C-terminal
tail and/or intracellular loops by GRKs. Recent studies have suggested
that individual GRKs contribute differently to this process and that
the distinct pattern of phosphorylation by each GRK triggers distinct
signaling events.− It is therefore important to elucidate the pattern of GPCR phosphorylation
on a given receptor by each GRK. There are a number of examples of
GPCRs whose phosphorylation sites have been mapped.−,, GRK knockdowns in HEK293
cells have been used to study the action
of specific GRKs in vivo.,,, However, as
GPCRs can be phosphorylated by other Ser/Thr kinases,
it is hard to unambiguously identify specific GRK sites using such
systems. In vitro GRK phosphorylation assays usually
need to be executed on a GPCR embedded in a lipid bilayer or membrane
and in a detergent-free environment, as lipid–GRK interactions
are required for GRK function,, and both GRK and GPCR
activity can be inhibited by detergents. Although phospholipid vesicles and bicelles offer a
lipid environment for GPCR reconstitution, these methods cannot control
the GPCR oligomeric state and topology of insertion. Nanodisc technology, on the other hand, allows for the
preparation of essentially homogeneous and monodisperse receptor–nanodisc
samples, in which the oligomeric state of the receptor is controlled.
It is also possible to control the lipid composition and operate in
a detergent-free environment.,, Purified NTSR1 was incorporated into nanodiscs using MSP1E3D1 and
zwitterionic POPC with various ratios of negatively charged POPG.
In these nanodiscs, NTSR1 was monomeric and surrounded by ∼150
lipid molecules (), likely providing a cushion of two or three lipid layers around
the receptor. Thus, this preparation provides an opportunity to observe
the interaction
of monomeric NTSR1 with GRKs and to study the effect of lipid charge
on NTSR1 phosphorylation with a defined lipid composition.

Previous
studies reported the trafficking of an arrestin complex
with the phosphorylated NTSR1 in HEK293 and COS7 cells.− Even though these studies suggest that the Ser/Thr clusters
on the C-terminal tail of NTSR1 were phosphorylated by GRKs, the use
of a whole cell extract does not allow for the identification of the
GRK(s) responsible. Here we observed that (i) GRK2 and GRK5 phosphorylate
monomeric NTSR1 in an activation-dependent
and -independent manner in vitro, respectively, (ii)
the negatively charged lipid POPG in the immediate vicinity of NTSR1
has a direct effect on phosphorylation, and (iii) GRK2 and GRK5 have
different phosphorylation patterns on NTSR1.

GRK2 phosphorylated
NTSR1 in an agonist-dependent manner (), consistent with
the hypothesis that GRKs serve as regulators for agonist-activated
GPCRs in the desensitization pathway., In the cell,
Gβγ recruits cytosolic GRK2 to the cell
membrane and adjusts its orientation to promote interaction with an
activated receptor and its phosphorylation., Under the conditions used in the in vitro experiments,
GRK2 does not require Gβγ for membrane association. Nanodisc-embedded
NTSR1 is surrounded by a cushion of two or three lipid layers and
likely does not offer GRK2 and Gβγ
a sufficient area to interact with lipids and form a GRK2–Gβγ
complex; nonetheless, GRK2 exhibits site-specific
phosphorylation.
Gβγ may be required only in cells, where mass action and/or
competition with other targets does not favor association of GRK2
with the active receptor unless specifically targeted by Gβγ
to membranes containing agonist-activated receptors. In contrast,
GRK5 phosphorylates NTSR1 in an activation-independent manner (). There have been
a number of reports that GRKs of the GRK4 subfamily phosphorylate
inactive GPCRs, which is thus perhaps an inherent characteristic of
the GRK4 subfamily. The α isoform of GRK4 phosphorylates receptors
in the absence of agonist activation, resulting in an increase in
the level of receptor internalization, and a decrease in the total
number
of receptors. GRK5 phosphorylates β2AR and M2 muscarinic
receptor in the absence of agonist., In the case
of β2AR, this agonist-independent receptor
phosphorylation by GRK5 promotes arrestin recruitment. Li et al. have
shown that inactive receptor phosphorylation by GRK5 is not
caused by the constitutive activity of the receptor or the membrane
association of the kinase. Thus, the
agonist-independent phosphorylation of NTSR1
by GRK5 is not an exception. The differential phosphorylation observed
for NTSR1 indicates that NTSR1 targeting by a specific GRK may affect
arrestin binding, leading to the activation
of distinct signaling pathways,
which may be agonist-dependent and/or tissue- and disease-specific.

GRKs are phospholipid-dependent enzymes, and in the case of GRK2,
negatively charged lipids promote the phosphorylation of GPCRs.,, In the case of GRK5, acidic phospholipids
such as phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate are responsible for its constitutive membrane association, and promote its autophosphorylation, which enhances GRK5 activity. In this
study, we used POPG as a negatively charged
lipid. Both GRKs required POPG for receptor phosphorylation ( and ). Interestingly, efficient NTSR1 phosphorylation is observed
for both GRK2 and GRK5 at a POPG content of &gt;20%, a value similar
to the proportion of negatively charged lipids in native plasma membranes. These results are thus consistent with the notion
that
negatively charged lipids in the immediate vicinity of NTSR1 have
a direct effect on the phosphorylation by GRKs, and that it is indeed
important to mimic the native lipid composition when probing GPCR
phosphorylation by GRK in vitro.

We indirectly
identified residues targeted for phosphorylation
by GRK2 and GRK5 using NTSR1 mutants, identifying six residues within
the two Ser/Thr clusters at the C-terminus. These results are consistent
with previously reported in vivo assays (). However, it remains controversial whether mutational studies
using C1A, C2A, and C1A/C2A mutants reflect the phosphorylation of
WT receptor by GRKs. For example, there are disagreements between
the phosphorylation sites identified and the role that such residues
play in the regulation of μOP.− To identify the phosphorylated
sites on NTSR1 directly,
agonist-activated NTSR1 WT embedded in 75% POPC/25% POPG nanodiscs
was exposed to GRK2 and GRK5 and analyzed by LC/MS/MS ( and Figure S3 and Table S2
of the ). We identified
two sites within the C-terminal C1 and C2 clusters that are phosphorylated
by GRK2. In the case of GRK5, 12 phosphorylation sites were identified:
four located within IL3 and
the others in the C-terminal Ser/Thr clusters. Because of the easy
loss of phosphoric acid in these analyses, it is difficult to identify
all phosphorylated species. However,
the results strongly suggest that GRK2 and
GRK5 phosphorylate NTSR1 specifically and that we can observe differential
phosphorylation by different GRKs in vitro.

Early studies suggested that GRK2 targets peptides that have pairs
of acidic residues preceding their phospho-acceptor sites like β2AR and μOP (A) and that GRK5 prefers a nonacidic peptide as its substrate. In the case of NTSR1, there are positively charged
clusters
instead of acidic ones. However, the mutational study did not show
a charge effect for NTSR1 phosphorylation by GRK2 and GRK5. In the
case of GRK2, it did not require acidic residues in the proximity
of phospho-acceptors, in contrast to β2AR and μOP
(B). Thus,
it is difficult to define a consensus motif for site-specific GRK
phosphorylation because the intracellular regions of GPCRs vary markedly
and each GRK has a distinct pattern for a given GPCR.

It was
hypothesized that differential phosphorylation of GPCRs
by different GRKs acts as a “barcode”, regulating their
interaction with arrestins, thus encoding a particular signaling outcome.−,, Nobles et al. reported that agonist-activated β2AR phosphorylation by GRK2 and GRK6 resulted in a distinct
phosphorylation pattern, and that this distinct pattern induced different
β-arrestin functions by inducing altered conformations of the
β2AR-bound β-arrestin. Even though the extension of this hypothesis to the
NTSR1 will require elucidation of a GRK-dependent NTSR1−β-arrestin
interaction, differential phosphorylation patterns of the two GRKs in vitro in this study using nanodiscs are consistent with
the idea that the action of different GRKs at the same receptor can
lead to significantly different physiological outcomes.
