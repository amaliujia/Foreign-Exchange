Arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT) catalyzes the penultimate step in the
biosynthesis of melatonin and other N-acetylarylalkylamides
from the corresponding arylalkylamine and acetyl-CoA. The N-acetylation
of arylalkylamines is a critical step in Drosophila melanogaster for the inactivation of the bioactive amines and the sclerotization
of the cuticle. Two AANAT variants (AANATA and AANATB) have been identified
in D. melanogaster, in which AANATA differs from
AANATB by the truncation of 35 amino acids from the N-terminus. We
have expressed and purified both D. melanogaster AANAT
variants (AANATA and AANATB) in Escherichia coli and
used the purified enzymes to demonstrate that this N-terminal truncation
does not affect the activity of the enzyme. Subsequent characterization
of the kinetic and chemical mechanism of AANATA identified an ordered
sequential mechanism, with acetyl-CoA binding first, followed by tyramine.
We used a combination of pH–activity profiling and site-directed
mutagenesis to study prospective residues believed to function in
AANATA catalysis. These data led to an assignment of Glu-47 as the
general base in catalysis with an apparent pKa of 7.0. Using the data generated for the kinetic mechanism,
structure–function relationships, pH–rate profiles,
and site-directed mutagenesis, we propose a chemical mechanism for
AANATA.

Biogenic
amines are important neuroactive amines found in both vertebrates
and invertebrates functioning as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators,
or neurohormones via their binding to specific receptors. In insects,
the biogenic arylalkylamines are dopamine, tyramine, serotonin, and
octopamine, which function primarily as neurotransmitters.1 The pathways for biosynthesis and degradation
have important roles in the function of the arylalkylamines as a balance
between production and clearance is necessary to maintain the appropriate
cellular concentrations of the amines. Dysfunction in either of these
opposing pathways would lead to improper cellular levels of the arylalkylamines,
leading to errors in the processes regulated by them.2

The biogenic arylalkylamines are all derived in vivo from the cognate aromatic amino acid (tyrosine or
tryptophan) precursor. The precursor amino acid is initially hydroxylated
by an aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (tyrosine hydroxylase or tryptophan
hydroxylase)3,4 and then decarboxylated by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (3,4-dihydroxylphenylalanine decarboxylase)5 to generate either dopamine or serotonin, respectively.
Tyramine is derived from the decarboxylation of tyrosine by tyrosine
decarboxylase,6,7 which can then be β-hydroxylated
to generate octopamine, a reaction that is catalyzed by tyramine β-hydroxylase.8−10 One proposed inactivation reaction for the arylalkylamines is N-acetylation
as catalyzed by arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase
(AANAT): acetyl-CoA + arylalkylamine → N-acetylarylalkylamine
+ CoA-SH.11,12 In addition to arylalkylamine inactivation,
acetyl-CoA-dependent N-acetylation is involved in cuticle sclerotization13−16 and melatonin biosynthesis.17,18

AANAT (EC 2.3.1.87),
also known as serotonin N-acetyltransferase and dopamine N-acetyltransferase, has been identified in Drosophila
melanogaster(11) and is a member
of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily.19,20 The identification of N-acetyltransferase activity
for arylalkylamines in D. melanogaster was first
shown in 1972 by Dewhurst et al.,11 followed
by the initial characterization of AANAT in 1977 by Maranda and Hodgetts.21 In 1998, Brodbeck et al.22 identified two biologically relevant variants, variant
A (AANATA) and variant B (AANATB), which differ by 35 amino acids
found only at the N-terminus of the larger AANATB. Differential transcription
of a single AANAT gene leads to the two different AANAT variants.22 These variants are expressed in different tissues
and at different life stages, with AANATA being found in the brain,
ventral nerve cord, and midgut during late stage embryogenesis and
in adults. AANATB is less abundant and is found in the brain only
during late pupal stages and in adults, as well.22 AANAT enzymes have been characterized from many organisms
and are known to catalyze the rate-limiting penultimate step in the
formation of melatonin.20,23−25 Melatonin is a hormone that is produced in a diurnal cycle24 (higher levels are found at night) and is suggested
to regulate the life span of D. melanogaster.18

Eight putative AANAT-like enzymes (AANATL)
have been identified in D. melanogaster(26) and are proposed to play a role in the biosynthesis
of fatty acid amides.27,28 Herein, we report on the cloning,
expression, purification, and characterization of D. melanogaster AANATA and AANATB from recombinant Escherichia coli. Our data show that AANATA and AANATB are catalytically similar
with respect to substrate specificities and measured kinetic constants
(Km,app and kcat,app). More detailed studies of AANATA were performed to define the kinetic
mechanism and to elaborate a chemical mechanism that is consistent
with both the pH–rate profiles and data from a set of site-directed
mutant enzymes.

Experimental Procedures

Ambion RETROscript Kit, ProBond nickel-chelating resin, and MicroPoly(A)
Purist were purchased from Invitrogen. NdeI, XhoI, Antarctic Phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased
from New England Biolabs. BL21(DE3) E. coli cells,
XL10 E. coli cells, and the pET-28a(+) vector were purchased from Novagen. Kanamycin
monosulfate and isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
were purchased from Gold Biotechnology. Oligonucleotides were purchased
from Eurofins MWG Operon, and PfuUltra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase
was purchased from Agilent. Benzoyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, butyryl-CoA,
hexanoyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, and N-acetylserotonin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All
other reagents were of the highest quality available from either Sigma-Aldrich
or Fisher Scientific.

Cloning of D. melanogaster AANATA and AANATB
A cDNA library was generated from D. melanogaster heads, using the Ambion RETROscript Kit
and MicroPoly(A) Purist kits. AANATA (NCBI reference
sequence NM_079115.2) and AANATB (NCBI reference sequence NM_206212.1) were amplified from the D. melanogaster head cDNA
library using the following primers: 5′ GAC TCA TAT GAT GGA
GGA CGC ATT GAC C 3′ (forward) and 5′ ATC CCT CGA GCT
ACA GCT TGG TCT GCG C 3′ (reverse); 5′ GCT ACA TAT GAT
GGA AGT GCA GAA GCT (forward) and 3′ ATC CCT CGA GCT ACA GCT
TGG TCT GCG C (reverse), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was performed using PfuUltra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, using the
following set of conditions: initial denaturing step of 95 °C
for 2 min, then 30 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30
s, and 72 °C for 1 min), and then a final extension step of 72
°C for 10 min. The AANATA product or the AANATB PCR product was inserted into a pET-28a(+) vector using the NdeI and XhoI
restriction enzymes, yielding an expression vector for each enzyme, AANATA pET-28a or AANATB pET-28a, respectively.
The AANATA pET-28a or AANATB pET-28a vector was then transformed into E. coli XL10 competent
cells and cultured in Luria broth (LB) supplemented with 40 μg/mL
kanamycin at 37 °C. The plasmids were purified using the Promega
Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification kit and sequenced by Eurofins
MWG operon. In separate experiments, the AANATA pET-28a or AANATB pET-28a vector was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression of AANATA or AANATB,
respectively.

Expression and Purification of AANATA and
AANATB
The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring
either the AANATA pET-28a or AANATB pET-28a expression vector were cultured in LB supplemented with 40 μg/mL
kanamycin at 37 °C. The cell cultures were induced at an OD600 of 0.6 with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
for 4 h at 37 °C. The final cultures were then harvested by centrifugation
at 5000g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet
was collected.

The pellet was then resuspended in 20 mM Tris
(pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole; the cells were lysed by
sonication, and the cellular debris was removed by centrifugation
(10000g for 15 min at 4 °C). The supernatant
was loaded onto a column packed with 6 mL of ProBond nickel-chelating
resin. The column was first washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole and then with 10
column volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, and 60 mM
imidazole, and AANATA or AANATB eluted in 1 mL fractions of 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole. Purity was assessed
by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE) and visualized using Coomassie stain. The protein
concentration was determined using the Bradford dye binding assay.

Production of Site-Directed Mutants
Each site-directed AANATA
mutant was generated by the overlap extension method29 using PfuUltra High-Fidelity DNA polymerase under the following
PCR conditions: initial denaturing step of 95 °C for 2 min, then
30 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C
for 1 min), and then a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min.
Primers for each mutant (Table S1 of the Supporting
Information) were designed with the Agilent QuickChange Primer
Design tool. The AANATA mutant PCR products were
then inserted into a pET-28a(+) vector using the NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes. The AANATA mutant pET-28a vectors were transformed into E. coli XL10 competent cells and cultured in LB supplemented
with 40 μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C. The plasmids were then
purified using the Promega Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification
kit and sequenced by Eurofins MWG operon. Individual mutant AANATA
proteins were expressed and purified as described previously for the
wild-type enzyme.

Measurement of Enzyme Activity
AANATA
and AANATB activity was analyzed using Ellman’s reagent30 by measuring the release of coenzyme A at 412
nm in 300 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 μM DTNB, and the desired
concentrations of the amino donor substrate and acyl-CoA substrate.
Initial velocities of CoA-SH release were measured using a Cary 300
Bio UV–visible spectrophotometer, and the resulting initial
velocity kinetic data were fit to the desired equation using SigmaPlot
12.0. Steady-state kinetic constants were obtained by a fit to eq 1 1  where vo is the initial velocity, [S]
is the substrate concentration, Vmax is
the maximal velocity, and Km is the Michaelis
constant.

Apparent kinetic constants for each arylalkylamine
substrate were determined by holding acetyl-CoA at a fixed saturating
concentration, whereas those for each acyl-CoA substrate were determined
by holding tyramine at a fixed saturating concentration at 22 °C.
Assays were performed in triplicate, and the uncertainties for the
(kcat/Km)app and relative (kcat/Km)app values were defined by using
eq 2, where σ is the standard error.31 2  

Kinetic
Mechanism and Inhibitor Analysis
Initial velocity patterns
for acetyl-CoA and tyramine were produced by varying the concentration
of one substrate while holding the concentration of the other substrate
at a fixed concentration and fitting the data to eq 3 for an ordered bi-bi mechanism using Igor Pro 6.34A 3  where Kia is the
dissociation constant for substrate A (acetyl-CoA), Kb is the Km for substrate
B (tyramine), and Ka is the Km for substrate A (acetyl-CoA). The two experimental sets
were generated by holding the tyramine concentration constant (5,
10, 25, and 50 μM) and varying the concentration of acetyl-CoA,
whereas the second set involved holding the concentration of acetyl-CoA
constant (20, 40, 60, and 100 μM) and varying the concentration
of tyramine.

The IC50 values for long-chain acyl-CoAs
and tyrosol were determined at the Km concentration
for the appropriate substrate, tyramine at 12 μM or acetyl-CoA
at 39 μM, while varying the concentration of the respective
inhibitor. The IC50 value was determined by a fit of the
resulting data to eq 4 using SigmaPlot 12.0 4  where vo is the initial velocity without
inhibitor, vi is the initial velocity
at different inhibitor concentrations, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration.
The assays were performed in triplicate.

Dead-end inhibitor
analysis was conducted for both oleoyl-CoA and tyrosol. The inhibition
patterns were determined by holding one substrate (acetyl-CoA or tyramine)
at a fixed concentration and varying the concentration of the other
substrate, with each set conducted at a different fixed concentration
of the inhibitor. The initial velocities from these inhibitor experiments
were fit to eqs 5–7 for competitive, noncompetitive, and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively 5   6   7  where vo is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximal velocity, [S] is the substrate
concentration, Km is the Michaelis constant,
[I] is the inhibitor concentration, and Ki is the inhibition constant. The assays were performed in triplicate.

Rate versus pH Dependence
The pH dependence of the steady-state
kinetic constants was determined for both acetyl-CoA and tyramine
as varied substrates while holding the other substrate at a fixed
concentration. Kinetic constants were determined at 0.5 pH intervals
from pH 6.0 to 9.5, using the following buffers: MES (pH 6.0–7.0),
Tris (pH 7.0–9.0), and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMeP) (pH
9.0–9.5). The resulting data were fit to eq 8 [log(kcat/Km-acetyl-CoA) or log(kcat/Km-tyramine)] and eq 9 (log kcat) 8   9  where c is the pH-independent plateau using Igor Pro 6.34A.

Intrinsic Fluorescence
Measurements for the Determination of the Coenzyme A Dissociation
Constant
Fluorescence spectra were generated with a JASCO
FP-8300 spectrofluorometer equipped with a circulating water bath
maintained at 22 °C. Emission spectra (excitation at 280 nm,
emission at 290–300 nm) were measured in a 0.4 cm path length
cell containing 400 μL of 300 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), varying
concentrations of coenzyme A, and a fixed AANATA enzyme concentration
(0.08 mg/mL for the wild type, 0.1 mg/mL for R153A). Fluorescence
emission spectra were acquired in triplicate, with a scan speed of
50 nm/min, an excitation bandwidth of −5 nm, and an emission
bandwidth of −2.5 nm. The Kd for
coenzyme A was determined by fitting the data to eq 10 with SigmaPlot 12.0 10  where ΔF is the change in intrinsic fluorescence, ΔFmax is the maximal change in fluorescence at
infinite ligand concentration, Kd is the
ligand dissociation constant, and [L] is the ligand concentration.

Product Characterization
Product characterization was performed
using a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6 μm C18 100 Å
(50 mm × 2.1 mm) reverse phase column coupled with an Agilent
6540 liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer
(LC/QTOF-MS) in positive ion mode. An enzyme reaction mixture comprised
of 300 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 μM acetyl-CoA, 1 mM serotonin,
and 5 μg AANATA in a final volume of 750 μL was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature. Then AANATA was removed from the reaction
mixture by centrifugation using a Millipore 10 kDa filter. The resulting
sample was injected on the LC/QTOF-MS, and the retention time and
high-resolution mass were compared with those of a commercial standard
of N-acetylserotonin. Conditions for LC/QTOF-MS analysis
are described in ref (27).

Results
Overexpression and Purification of AANATA
and AANATB
AANATA and AANATB were cloned from a cDNA library generated from the D. melanogaster head (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). Both genes were inserted into a pET28a(+) vector that encodes an N-terminal His6 tag.
Both AANATA and AANATB were purified using ProBond nickel-chelating
resin to homogeneity, yielding 21 mg of AANATA or 3 mg of AANATB per
liter of culture. Purity was assayed by SDS–PAGE (Figure S2
of the Supporting Information) and determined
to be &gt;95%.

Characterization of the Amino Acceptor Substrates
Amino acceptors are defined herein as any acyl-CoA or aryl-CoA
substrate. Our data for AANATA and AANATB (Table 1) show that the amino acceptor specificities are approximately
the same for both enzymes. Both catalyze the formation of N-acyltyramines, utilizing a set of straight-chain saturated
acyl-CoAs with little variation in the Km,app values from acetyl-CoA to hexanoyl-CoA for the two enzymes. A two-carbon
increase in acyl-chain length to decanoyl-CoA has a dramatic and negative
effect on catalysis. The Km,app is ∼10-fold
higher and the kcat,app ∼10-fold
lower than the values for octanoyl-CoA, such that the (kcat/Km)app,decanoyl-CoA is ∼1% of the (kcat/Km)app,octanoyl-CoA and only ∼0.04%
of the (kcat/Km)app,acetyl-CoA (Table 1). Acyl-CoA thioesters possessing an acyl chain of ≥12 carbon
atoms were not substrates for AANATA. Although lauroyl-CoA and the
longer-chain acyl-CoA thioesters were not AANATA substrates, all were
inhibitors of the enzyme with IC50 values of ≤1.1
μM. We find a slight increase in the apparent binding affinity
as the acyl-chain length increases, with the IC50 values
decreasing from 1.1 μM for lauroyl-CoA to 0.4 μM for oleoyl-CoA
(Table 2).

Benzoyl-CoA was also included in
our analysis of amino acceptor substrates to facilitate the comparison
of our substrate specificity data with those published for other N-acyltransferases.32,33 The (Km,app)benzoyl-CoA is similar to the
values we measured for short-chain acyl-CoA thioesters, but the kcat,app is significantly lower, such (kcat/Km)app,benzoyl-CoA is ∼1.5% of (kcat/Km)app,acetyl-CoA.

Characterization
of the Amino Donor Substrates
Amino donors are defined herein
as compounds that contain a free amino moiety. The substrate specificity
of AANATA was evaluated using a set of arylalkylamine amino donors;
these data show that tyramine is the amino donor with the highest
(kcat/Km)app value at saturating acetyl-CoA (Table 3). The kinetic constants for tyramine, with both AANATA and
AANATB, were very similar at saturating acetyl-CoA concentrations
[for AANATB, (Km,app)tyramine = 20 ± 3 μM and (kcat,app)tyramine = 16 ± 1 s–1 compared
with the AANATA data in Table 3].

Table 3 AANATA Steady-State Kinetic Constants for Different Arylalkylamines

DTNB, 500 μM acetyl-CoA, and varying concentration of arylalkylamine.

b Kinetic constants are reported
± standard error (n = 3).

A group of other arylalkylamines
was evaluated as AANATA amino donor substrates to better understand
the general structural features that affect binding and catalysis
(Table 3). The (kcat/Km)app values ranged over
2–3 orders of magnitude for the amino donors we included in
our study, with tyramine as the best amino donor with the highest
(kcat/Km)app value and 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine as the worst amino
donor substrate with the lowest (kcat/Km)app value. Tyramine and tryptamine
exhibit relatively high (kcat/Km)app values (Table 3); therefore, modification at the α-position was explored
to determine if their cognate amino acids could serve as substrates.
No activity was observed above the baseline rate of acetyl-CoA hydrolysis
for tyrosine, tyrosine methyl ester, or tryptophan. Next, we assessed
tyrosine, tyrosine methyl ester, and tryptophan as AANATA inhibitors
at a concentration of 1.0 mM, with the acetyl-CoA (39 μM) and
tyramine (12 μM) concentrations fixed at their respective Km,app values. No inhibition was observed for
these three compounds.

The amino donor substrate specificity
for AANATA was further evaluated to determine if non-arylalkylamines
could serve as substrates. The decarboxylated amino acids, histamine
(histidine) and ethanolamine (serine), were not AANATA substrates.
Isoniazid, a first-line drug for the treatment of tuberculosis,34−36 was evaluated for AANATA binding. There was no observed decrease
in the rate of reaction in the presence of 1.0 mM isoniazid.

Product
Characterization
The product formed from the AANATA reaction
using acetyl-CoA and serotonin as substrates was analyzed by LC/QTOF-MS
in positive ion mode. Identification of the product formed from this
reaction was compared with the commercial standard, N-acetylserotonin. The AANATA product, N-acetylserotonin,
was successfully identified by comparison of both the retention time
on a Kinetex 2.6 μm C18 100 Å (50 mm ×
2.1 mm) reverse phase column and the [M + H]+ (m/z) high-resolution mass spectroscopy
peak with those of the commercial standard (Table S2 of the Supporting Information).

Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibitor
Analysis
Initial velocity plots were generated using tyramine
and acetyl-CoA, by varying the concentration of one substrate while
holding the other substrate at a fixed saturated concentration. The
resulting double-reciprocal plots (Figure 1) reveal a pattern of intersecting lines, suggesting a sequential
kinetic mechanism in which both substrates must be bound before catalysis
can occur. Inhibition studies were used to differentiate between a
random and an ordered sequential mechanism for AANATA, using oleoyl-CoA
and tyrosol as the dead-end inhibitors. Oleoyl-CoA is an analogue
of acetyl-CoA, whereas tyrosol is an analogue of tyramine; neither
is a substrate for AANATA. Oleoyl-CoA is a competitive inhibitor (Figure 2) versus acetyl-CoA and a pure noncompetitive inhibitor
versus tyramine, with inhibition constants of 78 ± 8 nM and 150
± 9 nM, respectively. Tyrosol is uncompetitive versus acetyl-CoA
and competitive versus tyramine, with inhibition constants of 260
± 10 μM and 302 ± 34 μM, respectively.

pH Dependence of the Initial Rates
We studied the pH dependence on the kcat,app and (kcat/Km)app for both acetyl-CoA and tyramine. A rising pH profile
was observed for both (kcat/Km)app-acetyl-CoA (Figure 3C) and (kcat/Km)app-tyramine (Figure 3D). The data for both are best fit using a single
pKa,app value, yielding a pKa,app value of 7.1 ± 0.2 for the (kcat/Km)app-acetyl-CoA profile and a pKa,app value of 7.0 ±
0.3 for the (kcat/Km)app-tyramine profile. The kcat,app profile is bell-shaped (Figure 3A,B) for acetyl-CoA and tyramine, yielding two ionizable groups
with the same apparent pKa values, consisting
of an apparent pKa of 7.0 ± 0.1 and
an apparent pKa of 9.8 ± 0.2.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis of Amino Acids Proposed To Function in
Acid–Base Catalysis
Our pH–rate data indicate
that AANATA catalysis involves one species with a pKa,app of 7.0 and a second species with a pKa,app of 9.8. The pH–rate profile data provide
the apparent pKa values for the entities
involved in catalysis but do not provide definitive information concerning
the identity of these chemical species. Identification of these species
is critical for a more complete understanding of the catalytic mechanism.
One method we used to pinpoint residues important for catalysis was
the alignment of the primary sequences of known AANAT-like (AANATL)
enzymes from D. melanogaster (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information).26

The general base in the AANATA catalytic cycle is likely Glu-47,
Asp-142, or His-178, based on our pH–rate data, sequence alignment,
and crystal structure (Figure 4). We mutated
each of these residues to Ala to further define their respective role
in catalysis. Mutation of Glu-47 has the greatest effect on catalysis,
in that the kcat,app value decreases ∼15-fold
and the (kcat/Km)app decreases 10–200-fold relative to wild-type
values (Table 4). In addition, the E47A mutant
exhibited the same Km,app-acetyl-CoA value as the wild type (within experimental error) but did show
a 10–15-fold increase in Km,app-tyramine. The D142A and H178A mutants were catalytically competent, exhibiting kcat,app values that were 80–170% of the
wild-type value. The small decreases observed in the (kcat/Km)app values
for the D142A and H178A mutants relative to the wild-type value resulted
largely from increases in the Km,app values
for both acetyl-CoA and tyramine (Table 4).

The AANATA crystal structure also points toward Tyr-64, Cys-181,
Ser-182, or Ser-186 serving as the general acid (Figure 5) with a pKa,app of 9.8, visible
in our pH–rate studies. Each of these residues was mutated
to an Ala, and the kinetic parameters for each mutant were determined.
The steady-state kinetic parameters for the C181A mutant are similar
to the wild-type values. In contrast with the C181A mutant, the Y64A
and S186A mutants were catalytically deficient, yielding (kcat/Km)app values that were 5–40% of the wild-type value, the decrease
mostly came from increases in the Km,app values (Table 4). Also, we constructed and
evaluated the S182A/S186A double mutant. The kinetic parameters for
S182A/S186A were similar to those of the S186A single mutant, with
the exception of an even higher Km,app-tyramine, such that the value increased from 12 μM for the wild type
to 73 μM for the S186A mutant and to 190 μM for the S182A/S186A
double mutant (Table 4).

Site-Directed Mutagenesis of Other Amino Acids Conserved between
AANATA and Other AANAT-like Enzymes Found in Drosophila
Three residues, Pro-48, Arg-153, and His-220, were conserved
among AANATA and the other Drosophila AANATL enzymes
(Figure S3 of the Supporting Information) and seem necessary in maintaining the AANATA structure.37 Each of these residues was mutated to an Ala
in an attempt to characterize their function (Figures S4 and S5 of
the Supporting Information). The results
are similar for both the P48A and H220A mutant enzymes, including
(kcat/Km)app values that are 16–830-fold lower than the wild-type
value resulting from decreases in the kcat,app values (16–870-fold lower) and increases in the Km,app values for the substrates (4–40-fold higher)
(Table 4). Notably, the (kcat/Km)app-tyramine for the P48A mutant is 830-fold lower than that of the wild type.
The pattern of results for the R153A mutant is different as the (kcat/Km)app value is decreased only 2–5-fold relative to that of the
wild type. The outcome for the R153 mutant results from a 5–7-fold
increase in kcat,app values that is balanced
against 10–24-fold increases in the Km,app values for the acetyl-CoA and tyramine substrates (Table 4).

Salt Dependence of the Initial Rates
Arg-153 forms a salt bridge with Asp-46, and our evaluation of the
R153A mutant indicates that the Arg-153–Asp-46 salt bridge
is important in substrate binding and catalysis. The salt dependence
of kinetic parameters, if any, could provide additional support for
this suggestion. We found an increase in kcat,app and Km,app-acetyl-CoA as
the concentration of NaCl added to the reaction buffer increased from
0 to 500 mM [0 mM NaCl, Table 1; 100 mM NaCl,
(kcat,app)acetyl-CoA = 49 ± 1 and (Km,app)acetyl-CoA = 89 ± 10; 500 mM NaCl, (kcat,app)acetyl-CoA = 60 ± 1 and (Km,app)acetyl-CoA = 150 ± 10].

Coenzyme A (CoA-SH) Binding to Wild-Type AANATA and the R153A Mutant
The increase in kcat,app values for
the R153A mutant was unexpected and may be related to a decrease in
the binding affinity of the AANATA for CoA-SH, one product of the
reaction. The equilibrium constant for the dissociation of CoA from
the enzyme·CoA complex was obtained by measuring the quenching
of intrinsic protein fluorescence at different CoA-SH concentrations
for both wild-type AANATA and the R153A mutant. From these studies,
we determined that the Kd,wild-type = 400 ± 50 μM and the Kd,R153A = 950 ± 110 μM (Figure 6).

Discussion
Comparison of AANATA and
AANATB
AANATA differs from AANATB by an N-terminal truncation
of 35 amino acids. Both variants are physiologically relevant in D. melanogaster, but differences in the expression patterns
for each enzyme with respect to tissue distribution and stages of
development have been identified.22 Although
the differences in the expression patterns for the two enzymes suggest
that AANATA and AANATB do not serve the same metabolic role in D. melanogaster, it is not known if truncation of AANATA
to AANATB has any effect on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme.
A comparison of the kinetic constants for AANATA and AANATB shows
that the two enzymes are catalytically equivalent, at least for the
substrates included in our study. Thus, our data provide no clear
insight regarding the differential expression of two AANAT variants
in Drosophila. Most likely, the presence of AANATA
and AANATB is important for differences in (a) subcellular localization
for the two enzymes, (b) substrate specificities between the two enzymes
that were not revealed by our work, (c) the modes regulation for the
two enzymes, and/or (d) the post-translational modification of the
two enzymes. Potential differences in post-translational modification
patterns between AANATA and AANATB could be important because the
activity of sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase is
regulated by the phosphorylation of Thr/Ser residues located in N-terminal
or C-terminal regions of the protein.38−46

Substrate Specificity and the Potential Role of AANATA in Fatty Acid
Amide Biosynthesis
We have had a long-standing interest in
the biosynthesis of the fatty acid amides, a broad family of cell
signaling lipids. One straightforward route to the fatty acid amides
would be the reaction of a biogenic amine with an acyl-CoA, a possibility
that has received relatively little attention. The identification
of N-acyltransferases that catalyze the acyl-CoA-dependent
formation of N-fatty acylglycines,47N-fatty acylserotonins,27 and N-fatty acyldopamines27 means that this chemistry should be examined in greater
detail. Fatty acid amides are produced in D. melanogaster,48 but the enzymes responsible for their
production in the fly are largely unknown. There is a single report
of an enzyme, arylalkylamine N-acyltransferase like
2 (AANATL2), that catalyzes the formation of long-chain N-acylserotonins and N-acyldopamines.27 We undertook a detailed investigation of the
substrate specificity of AANATA to address this question.

We
first evaluated the substrate specificity for the acyl-CoA thioester
substrates. The Km,app-acyl-CoA values were similar for acetyl-CoA through octanoyl-CoA, indicating
that the AANATA active site can effectively bind the straight-chain
acyl chain with lengths of eight or fewer carbon atoms. However, the kcat,app decreased ∼30-fold as the acyl
change length increased from acetyl-CoA to octanoyl-CoA, with acetyl-CoA
being the substrate with the highest (kcat/Km)app value. Lengthening
the acyl chain to more than eight carbon atoms resulted in a dramatic
effect on the kinetic parameters. Decanoyl-CoA is a poor substrate
relative to the shorter-chain acyl-CoA substrates, with a Km,app value of 220 μM, &gt;10-fold higher
than that of octanoyl-CoA, and a kcat,app value of 0.04 s–1, 7-fold lower than that of octanoyl-CoA.
Lauroyl-CoA and longer-chain acyl-CoA thioesters are not AANATA substrates
but are inhibitors of the enzyme, with IC50 values of 0.4–1.0
μM. These data show that acetyl-CoA is best positioned for nucleophilic
attack by the amino group of tyramine within the AANATA active site
and that an increase in length alters the arrangement of the two substrates
into suboptimal positions, resulting in a decrease in kcat,app. The AANATA active site must have sufficient flexibility
to accommodate the lengthening acyl chain, up to eight carbon atoms,
and still position the two substrates for chemistry with reasonable
effectiveness as the (kcat/Km)app for octanoyl-CoA is 3% of the acetyl-CoA
value. The limit of active site “tolerance” is an acyl
chain of 10 carbon atoms because decanoyl-CoA is a poor substrate
with a (kcat/Km)app value that is 0.04% of the acetyl-CoA value. Acyl-CoA
thioesters with acyl chains longer than 10 carbon atoms bind to AANATA
and are not substrates; the long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters either
prevent tyramine binding in a position that allows chemistry to occur
or actually prevent tyramine from binding. Thus, the long-chain acyl-CoA
thioesters are inhibitors of AANATA.

Amino donors are defined
herein as compounds that contain a free amino moiety. The substrate
specificity of AANATA was evaluated using a variety of arylalkylamine
amino donors, and these data show that tyramine is the amino donor
with the highest (kcat/Km)app value. The kinetic constants for tyramine,
with both AANATA and AANATB, were very similar (for AANATB, Km,app-tyramine = 20 ± 3 μM
and kcat,app-tyramine = 16 ±
1 s–1 compared to the data for AANATA in Table 3).

We evaluated a number of biologically important
arylalkylamines as AANATA substrates, including tyramine, octopamine,
dopamine, tryptamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. These arylalkylamines
are found in vivo and potentially could be found
as the amine partner in the fatty acid amide family. All are respectable
AANATA substrates with tyramine exhibiting the highest (kcat/Km)app value
(at saturating acetyl-CoA) and serotonin the worst, with a (kcat/Km)app,tyramine/(kcat/Km)app,serotonin ratio of 6 (Table 3). The differences in the kinetic parameters among this set of biologically
relevant arylalkylamines are reflected in the Km,app values, whereas the kcat,app values are similar for these amino donor substrates. Our results
for the substrate specificity of AANATA with respect to both acyl-CoA
and biologically relevant arylalkylamines provide evidence that the
fatty acid amides can be produced by the conjugation of biogenic amines
to an acyl-CoA. However, AANATA is probably not involved in the in vivo biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acid amides because
the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesters are not substrates. The major
function of AANATA in the cell is likely amine acetylation, a reaction
important in neurotransmitter inactivation, melatonin biosynthesis,
and cuticle sclerotization.

Our discovery of the AANATA-catalyzed
acetylation of 5-methoxytryptamine opens up an alternative route for
melatonin biosynthesis. Melatonin is produced from l-tryptophan
in a series of four steps: hydroxylation to 5-hydroxytryptophan, decarboxylation
to serotonin, acetylation to N-acetylserotonin, and
methylation to N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin).49,50 Our data for the AANATA-catalyzed acetylation of serotonin and 5-methoxytryptamine
[(kcat/Km)app,5-methoxytryptamine/(kcat/Km)app,serotonin ∼ 2] show that both of these amines are effective AANATA
substrates, similar to that reported by Falcon et al.51 It seems plausible that melatonin biosynthesis could involve
either serotonin acetylation followed by methylation or serotonin
methylation followed by acetylation. One question is whether 5-methoxytryptamine
is biosynthesized in vivo to allow direct acetylation
to melatonin. The level of 5-methoxytryptamine was shown to increase
in a time-dependent manner in hamster skin cells upon incubation with
serotonin.52 Further studies are required
to address this possible route to melatonin in D. melanogaster.

In addition to the biologically relevant amines, a larger
group of arylalkylamine substrates were analyzed to understand the
general structural features of the amino donor substrates that affect
AANATA binding and/or catalysis. These include indole and phenyl ring
modifications, the length of the spacer group between the amino group
and the phenyl ring, modification of the α- and β-positions
on the ethylamine spacer group, and other non-arylalkylamines that
may function as amine substrates.

The ring-substituted analogues
of tyramine included herein are dopamine, phenethylamine, 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenethylamine,
3-methoxyphenethylamine, 4-methoxyphenethylamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine,
3,4-methoxyphenethylamine, and 7-methyltryptamine. All are respectable
AANATA substrates with kcat,app values
that are approximately the same as that for tyramine (19 s–1) or higher. The tyramine analogue with the highest kcat,app value of 71 s–1 is 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenethylamine.
However, there is considerable variation in the Km,app values among the tyramine series, ranging from 12
μM for tyramine to 3200 μM for 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine
(Table 3). Similar trends were observed in
comparing the kinetic parameters between tryptamine and the ring-substituted
tryptamine analogue: little variation in the kcat,app values with greater differences being found for the Km,app values.

Tyramine and tryptamine
exhibit relatively high (kcat/Km)app values, allowing us also to
examine how changes in the spacer group between the amine moiety and
the phenyl or indole ring affect AANAT catalysis. First, we determined
that the cognate amino acids, tyrosine and tryptophan, were neither
substrates nor inhibitors of AANATA, as were the results for tyrosine
methyl ester. These data demonstrate that the presence of an α-carboxylate
or α-carboxylate ester dramatically decreases AANATA binding
affinity, mainly because of steric interference in the active site.
In contrast with our data about the effect of α-substitution
of tyramine, we find that modification at the β-position has
an only small effect on binding and catalysis as octopamine, norepinephrine,
and β-methylphenethylamine are all AANATA substrates with (kcat/Km)app values that are 20–80% of the value for tyramine. The relatively
minimal effect of β-substitution is on binding affinity as all
of the β-substituted tyramines have approximately the same kcat,app values. This pattern holds true for
the comparison of dopamine to norepinephrine (β-hydroxyldopamine),
which both have approximately the same Km,app, kcat,app, and (kcat/Km)app values. Also,
we interrogated the importance of the spacer length between the amino
group and the phenyl ring using another set of tyramine analogues.
Decreasing the spacer length from two methylene groups to one methylene
group yields benzylamine, C6H5-CH2-NH2. Benzylamine is not a substrate. Increasing the spacer
length from two methylene groups to four methylenes yields 4-phenylbutylamine,
C6H5-(CH2)4-NH2. 4-Phenylbutylamine is a poor AANATA substrate, exhibiting a (kcat/Km)app that is 120-fold decreased relative to that of tyramine, with the
largest extent of the decrease reflected in an ∼20-fold increase
in Km,app [12 μM for tyramine vs
270 μM for 4-phenylbutylamine (Table 3)]. Our specificity studies of the amino donor substrates again demonstrate
that the AANATA active site is flexible, able to accommodate a variety
of structures particularly analogues of tyramine or tryptamine, with
either a β-substitution of the ethylamine moiety or the addition
of hydrophobic bulk to the phenyl or indole rings. AANATA is less
tolerant of substitution at the α-substitution of the ethylamine
moiety or changing the length of the methylene spacer between the
amino group and the ring. Substitution at the α-position seems
to eliminate binding to AANATA, while alternation in the length of
space hinders the optimal positioning of the amino donor for nucleophilic
attack of acetyl-CoA.

The availability of recombinant AANATA
has afforded us the opportunity to explore the specificity of this
enzyme for both its acyl-CoA and amine substrates. The structure–activity
information obtained from this work will be valuable for the future
development of inhibitors targeted against the N-acyltransferases,
particularly those involved in fatty acid amide biosynthesis. Errors
in fatty acid amide metabolism are correlated to human disease,53−56 and considerable effort has been devoted to the development of inhibitors
for the major enzyme responsible for fatty acid amide degradation,
fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH).57

Kinetic Mechanism and Inhibitor Analysis
An intersecting
initial velocity double-reciprocal plot indicates that a ternary complex
is formed prior to catalysis for AANATA. The dead-end inhibitor patterns
for oleoyl-CoA and tyrosol point toward an ordered sequential mechanism,
with acetyl-CoA binding first, followed by tyramine binding to generate
the AANATA·acetyl-CoA·tyramine ternary complex before catalysis
occurs. An ordered sequential mechanism with acetyl-CoA binding first
suggests that acetyl-CoA binding drives a conformational change to
convert the amine binding pocket from a low-affinity state to a high-affinity
state. Oleoyl-CoA is a known inhibitor of human and sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase, and the inhibition is not a detergent
effect of the C18 tail because the IC50 for
oleic acid is 500-fold higher than that for oleoyl-CoA.58,59 Tyrosol is an analogue of tyramine, with the amine being replaced
with a hydroxyl group. A rate was not observed for tyrosol acetylation
at 100 mM, which shows that AANATA will not catalyze the O-acylation
of at least this substrate. Tryptophol, a similar analogue of tryptamine,
is an inhibitor of sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase
and was useful in studies to define the kinetic mechanism of this
enzyme.60 An ordered sequential mechanism
for D. melanogaster AANATA is consistent with isothermal
calorimetry data demonstrating little binding of dopamine to AANATA
in the absence of acetyl-CoA,37 as well
as with the kinetic mechanism proposed for sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase.60

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis To Match Catalytic Amino Acids to the Measured pKa,app Values
We employed protein sequence
alignments, pH–rate studies, site-directed mutagenesis of targeted
amino acids, and information from the AANATA crystal structure37 to propose a chemical mechanism for the AANATA-catalyzed
formation of N-acylarylalkylamides. Primary sequence
alignment of AANATA with other D. melanogaster AANATL
enzymes identified a number of conserved residues that might function
in catalysis. A primary sequence alignment of D. melanogaster AANATA with sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase
produced a low sequence alignment score (&lt;12%), and the catalytic
core of the mammalian ortholog61−66 is not conserved in the fly enzyme. Therefore, AANATA could catalyze
the formation of the same N-acetylarylalkylamide
products as the mammalian ortholog with either a completely different
chemical mechanism or, at minimum, different catalytic amino acid
residues.

Our pH–rate studies implicate two chemical
species with pKa,app values of 7.0 and
9.8 in AANATA catalysis (Figure 3). The pKa,app value of 7.0 was observed in the kcat,app and (kcat/Km)app profiles and, most
likely, reflects deprotonation by Glu-47. Evidence consistent with
the proposal that Glu-47 serves as a general base in the AANAT catalytic
cycle includes the conservation of Glu-47 among the D. melanogaster family of AANATL enzymes, the catalytic deficiency of the E47A mutant,
and the disappearance of the pKa,app of
7.0 in the pH–rate profile of the E47A mutant. Cheng et al.36 reported that the log(kcat/Km)app versus pH
profile for the E47A mutant is linear, with a slope of 0.3, probably
resulting from hydroxide chemically rescuing Glu-47 as the base in
AANATA catalysis. Furthermore, a Glu residue has been proposed as
the general base in other GNAT enzymes such as members of the Gcn5/PCAF
family of histone N-acetyltransferases67,68 and human spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase.99−70

A pKa,app of 9.8
was observed in the pH–rate profiles for only kcat,app, indicating that this chemical species contributes
to catalysis only after the first irreversible step (Figure 3A,B). We must point out that Ellman’s reagent
is unstable and the acyl-CoA substrates are subject to rapid base-catalyzed
hydrolysis at pH &gt;9.5. Because we measure AANAT activity by assaying
CoA release using Ellman’s reagent, our pH–rate studies
are confined to pH ≤9.5. Thus, the lack of a pKa,app of ≥9.8 in our (kcat/Km)app profiles may reflect
our inability to conduct measurements at pH &gt;9.5, and the presence
of a pKa,app of 9.8 for in the kcat,app profiles is based on a fit of our data,
all generated at pH ≤9.5, to eq 9. Cheng
et al.37 extended their studies to pH 10
and found a clearly defined pKa,app of
9.0 ± 0.2 in their pH–rate profiles for (kcat/Km)app. Experimental
differences between our work and that of Cheng et al.37 render direct comparisons of the respective data sets difficult,
but it seems likely that a chemical species with a pKa of 9–10 does participate in AANATA catalysis.

With this in mind, we sought to identify the chemical species that
would serve as a general acid in AANATA; possibilities include Tyr-64,
Cys-181, Ser-182, Tyr-185, and Ser-186 (Figure 5). Cys-181 and Tyr-185 were eliminated because the corresponding
alanine substitution mutants (C181A and Y185A) showed little to no
effect on the kcat,app relative to the
wild-type value (Table 4 and ref (36)). Tyr-64 is located within
a nonpolar binding pocket for the amino donor substrate,37 and comparison of the Y64A mutant to the wild
type reveals increases in the Km,app values
for both substrates (2-fold for acetyl-CoA and 6-fold for tyramine)
and an only ∼2-fold decrease in the kcat,app values (Table 4). Most likely,
Tyr-64 is involved in substrate binding and is not the general acid
in AANATA catalysis. Ser-182 and Ser-186 remain as potential general
acids. The mutation of both to Ala decreases kcat,app relative to that of the wild type, 12-fold for the
S182A mutant and 3–5-fold for the S186A mutant (Table 4 and ref (36)). The pH–rate profiles for the S182A and S186A mutants
are pH-independent37 at pH ≥7.0,
meaning that the pKa,app of 9.0 is not
observed for these two mutant enzymes. On the basis of these data
and the proximity of both Ser-182 and Ser-186 to the acetyl-CoA thiol
group, 4.0 and 4.1 Å, respectively (Figure 7), it is conceivable that either Ser-182 or Ser-186 is the general
acid in AANATA catalysis. In fact, Cheng et al.37 argue that Ser-186 is the general acid, functioning to
protonate the departing thiolate anion of CoA to complete the catalytic
cycle. An argument could be made that Ser-182 and Ser-186 serve redundant
roles in catalysis where one of these serines is the general acid,
whereas the other serine serves to depress the pKa of the catalytic serine. In the absence of the catalytic
serine, the other serine could chemically “rescue” the
function of the other serine.

involving the general base, Glu-47.

We do not favor either Ser-182 or Ser-186 being the general
acid in AANATA catalysis. This would require a significant depression
of 3–5 pH units in the pKa for
Ser-182 or Ser-186, and we would expect the S182A/S186A double mutant
to be dramatically impaired as a catalyst relative to either the S182A
or S186A single mutant. Instead, we find that the S182A/S186A double
mutant exhibits a kcat,app similar to
that of the S186A mutant; the largest difference for S182A/S186A is
an increased Km,app for tyramine. A tyrosine
serves as the general acid for other GNAT enzymes, but the mutation
studies eliminate the two active tyrosine residues, Tyr-64 and Tyr-185,
as possibilities. There are no other obvious candidate amino acids
to serve as a general acid within the acetyl-CoA binding pocket.37

We propose that the pKa,app of 9.8 in our pH–rate profiles (and the pKa,app of 9.0 from ref (37)) represents the pKa of the thiol group of CoA, which has been
reported to range from 9.6 to 10.4.71,72 Formation
of the protonated CoA-SH product results from the collapse of the
tetrahedral intermediate (Scheme 1), as proposed
for other N-acyltransferases.73−75 The deprotonation
of CoA-SH to CoA-S–, in the AANATA active site,
inhibits product release, accounting for the decrease in kcat,app at pH &gt;9. This was likely not observed in the
(kcat/Km)app profiles because of either the difficulty in measuring
the kinetic constants at high pH (instability of DTNB and/or the rapid
hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA) or the fact that the protonation of CoA-S– occurs after the first irreversible step in catalysis.
Our suggestion obviates the need for an active site residue that serves
as the general acid and is consistent with the data available for
AANATA.

Site-Directed Mutagenesis
of Amino Acids That Are Important in Substrate Binding and AANAT Structure
As detailed previously, we mutated a number of amino acids in AANATA
in an attempt to match an active site amino acid to the pKa,app values identified in the pH–rate profiles.
The set of AANATA mutants that we produced also provide information
regarding the amino acids involved in substrate binding and point
toward structural changes in the protein. In silico docking of dopamine into the AANATA structure with acetyl-CoA bound
suggests that the amino donor substrate binds into a hydrophobic binding
pocket containing Phe-43, Leu-61, Tyr-64, Ile-116, and Ile-145.37 Our results are consistent with the docking
results as the Km,app-tyramine values
for the E47A, P48A, and Y64A mutants are &gt;6-fold higher than the
wild-type value (Table 4). The Km,app-tyramine values for H220A and S186A single
mutants also are ≥6-fold higher than the wild-type value, indicating
that these amino acids contribute to the binding of the amino donor
substrate. Of the mutants with a 6-fold increase in the Km,app-tyramine value relative to the wild-type
value, only the E47A and S186A mutants showed no difference in Km,app-acetyl-CoA, indicating that
Glu-47 and Ser-186 contribute little to acetyl-CoA binding. The Km,app-tyramine value for the S182A/S186A
double mutant (190 μM) is significantly higher than the wild-type
value (12 μM), suggesting that Ser-182 and Ser-186 function
synergistically in maintaining the proper active site architecture
for optimal binding to the amino donor substrate. The binding pocket
for acetyl-CoA is more extensive than the pocket for the amino donor
substrate and includes the amino acids involved in catalysis.

There are amino acids uniquely involved in acetyl-CoA binding, for
which there is a change of only the value of Km,app-acetyl-CoA upon mutation. This was observed
for the D142A and H178A mutants: Km,app-tyramine values that are approximately the same as that of the wild type
and Km,app-acetyl-CoA values
that are 2–3-fold higher than that of the wild type. Both Km,app-tyramine and Km,app-acetyl-CoA values for the P48A, Y64A,
R153A, and H220A mutants are all different from and greater than the
wild-type values (Table 4). These amino acids
either are involved in domains within AANATA that overlap between
the acetyl-CoA and amino donor binding pockets or are key to maintaining
the AANATA structure in a conformation that is optimal for substrate
binding. Overlap between the binding sites for the two substrates
is expected because the binding pocket for acetyl-CoA is more extensive
than the pocket for the amino donor substrate36 and should include the amino acids that are required to position
the amino group of the amino donor for nucleophilic attack at the
carbonyl of the acetyl-CoA thioester moiety. In addition, the synergistic
effect of acetyl-CoA binding to convert the amine binding pocket from
a low-affinity state to a high-affinity state means that specific
amino acids important for acetyl-CoA binding can also have a dramatic
effect on amine binding.

In comparing the kinetic constants
of our mutants to those of wild-type AANATA (Table 4), we find that three of our mutants stand out: E47A, P48A,
and R153A. We argue that Glu-47 is the catalytic base and find, as
anticipated, that E47A is catalytically deficient with relatively
low kcat,app values. The AANATA structure
containing bound acetyl-CoA37 reveals a
set of ordered water molecules between the carboxylate of Glu-47 and
the carbonyl of the acetyl-CoA thioester. The distance from the carboxyl
of Glu-47 to the carbonyl of the acetyl-CoA thioester is 6.8 Å.
We suggest that Glu-47 functions as a general base to allow the water-assisted
deprotonation of the positively charged amino group of the donor substrate
(a “proton wire”) and to properly position the neutral
amine for attack at the carbonyl of the acetyl-CoA thioester (Scheme 1). Elimination of the anionic carboxylate of Glu-47
by mutation to Ala would alter the positions of the ordered water
molecules (perhaps, even resulting in their loss) and would decrease
the affinity for only the amino donor substrate, as found for the
E47A mutant.

Pro-48 is found at the beginning of a flexible
loop and is positioned within the predicted binding pocket for the
amine donor substrate (Figure S6 of the Supporting
Information). We superimposed the AANATA crystal structure
[Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3TE4]37 with that
of sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase (PDB entry 1CJW)61 using Protein Binding Site Tools (ProBiS Tools) and found
that Pro-48 from D. melanogaster AANATA is equivalent
to Pro-64 from sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase.
In sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase, Pro-64 is
also positioned on a flexible loop that undergoes a major structural
change to alter the amino donor substrate binding pocket from a low-
to high-affinity state.76,77 In the low-affinity
state, Pro-64 occupies the acetyl-CoA binding pocket, whereas in the
high-affinity state, Pro-64 moves ∼8 Å to form a base-staking
interaction with the tryptamine moiety of the tryptamine–acetyl-CoA
bisubstrate inhibitor cocrystallized with the sheep enzyme. Our data
for the P48A mutant, low kcat,app and
high Km,app-tyramine and Km,app-acetyl-CoA values, suggest
that Pro-48 in AANATA functions like Pro-64 in sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase and further hints that protein dynamics
could regulate catalysis for AANATA. His-220 is in van der Waals contact
with Pro-48 in AANATA (Figure 8). Replacement
of His-220 with Ala will alter this interaction and, as seen in the
data for the P48A mutant, would lead to the observed increases in
the Km,app-tyramine and Km,app-acetyl-CoA values for the
H220A mutant.

found in AANATA along with secondary structure highlighting van der
Waals interactions between His-220 of Tyr-185 and His-220 of Pro-48.

The R153A mutant is intriguing,
with values higher than wild-type values for kcat,app, Km,app-tyramine, and Km,app-acetyl-CoA. The ∼6-fold increase in kcat,app is balanced against 10–20-fold increases in the Km,app values, such that the (kcat/Km)app value for the R153A
mutant is lower than that of the wild type by 40–80%. As revealed
from the AANATA structure with acetyl-CoA bound,37 Arg-153 participates in a water-mediated hydrogen bond
with the carbonyl amide of the pantothenate moiety (atom O9P) of acetyl-CoA
and in a salt bridge to Asp-46 (Figure 9).
The increase in the Km,app values for
both substrates suggests that Arg-153 is critical not only in the
acetyl-CoA binding pocket but also in forming the binding pocket for
the amine substrate. The increase in the kcat,app value suggests that Arg-153 contributes to a rate-determining step
in catalysis, related to the salt bridge between Arg-153 and Asp-46.
We suspect that the Arg-153–Asp-46 salt bridge is critical
to an AANATA conformation that decreases the rate of CoA-SH release,
such that product release is, at least, partially rate-limiting. Partially
rate-determining CoA-SH release has been identified in many other N-acetyltransferases.20,66,78,79 Elimination of the Arg-153–Asp-46
salt bridge in the R153A increases the rate of CoA-SH release, reflected
in the increase in kcat,app, but decreases
the affinity of AANATA for both substrates, reflected in the increases
in the Km,app values. Another approach
to decrease the influence of the Arg-153–Asp-46 salt bridge
on the rate of CoA-SH release would be to increase the salt concentration
in the reaction buffer. Our prediction is that a greater salt concentration
would mimic the pattern of results we obtained for the R153A mutant,
which is exactly what we found. The values of kcat,app and Km,app-acetyl-CoA increased as the concentration of added NaCl increased from 0 to
500 mM. Similar data were obtained for sheep serotonin N-acetyltransferase,25 which was argued
to increase the rate of CoA-SH release by shielding charge–charge
interactions of the enzyme with the anionic phosphates of acetyl-CoA.
Also, we determined the Kd for binding
of CoA-SH to both wild-type AANATA and the R153A mutant by measuring
the quenching of intrinsic protein fluorescence as a function of CoA-SH
concentration [Kd,wild-type = 400
± 50 μM, and Kd,R153A = 950
± 110 μM (Figure 6)]. The 2.4-fold
decrease in affinity for the binding of CoA-SH to the R153A mutant
is in reasonable agreement with the (kcat,app)wild-type/(kcat,app)R153A ratio of 5–6 (Table 4). The salt-dependent increase in both kcat,app and Km,app-acetyl-CoA and
the increase in Kd for CoA-SH for the
R153A mutant provide evidence that the salt bridge between Arg-153
and Asp-46 is important for decreasing the rate of release of CoA-SH
from wild-type AANATA. Similar to our data for the P48A mutant, our
data for the R153A mutant point toward protein dynamics regulating
catalysis for AANATA.

Chemical Mechanism for AANATA catalysis
A chemical mechanism
for the catalytic cycle for AANATA, consistent with our new data and
previously published data,21,37 is illustrated in Scheme 1. The mechanism features (a) chemistry occurring
after the formation of the AANATA·acetyl-CoA·tyramine complex,
(b) Glu-47 serving as a general base to facilitate water-assisted
deprotonation of tyramine, (c) nucleophilic attack of deprotonated
tyramine at the carbonyl of the acetyl-CoA thioester to form a zwitterionic
tetrahedral intermediate, (d) collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate
with the concomitant protonation of CoA, and (e) ordered product release
with CoA-SH departing last to regenerate AANATA for the next round
of catalysis. Our only evidence of the ordered product release is
the data showing that CoA-SH binds to AANATA in the absence of N-acetyltyramine (Figure 7) and is
consistent with the ordered binding of substrates, acetyl-CoA binding
first. The release of CoA-SH is partially rate-determining because
of the AANATA conformation that has a relatively high affinity for
CoA-SH. The Arg-153–Asp-46 salt bridge is critical to maintaining
AANATA in this conformation, and the affinity for CoA-SH increases
as the CoA-S– thiolate forms at higher pH.

One issue remaining with this mechanism is the roles played by Ser-182
and Ser-186 in catalysis, given that Ser-186 was proposed to serve
as the general acid in AANATA catalysis.37 A preponderance of the data for the S182A, S186A, and S182A/S186A
mutants seem to rule out a direct catalytic role for both Ser-182
and Ser-186, and the transfer of a proton from a serine hydroxyl to
a thiol is thermodynamically unfavorable. Instead, we suggest that
Ser-182 and Ser-186 are involved in an elaborate network of hydrogen
bonds that function in both substrate binding and catalysis (Figure 4). Mutation of Ser-182 and/or Ser-186 to alanine
alters the hydrogen bonding network, changing the active site architecture.
This alteration of the active site is reflected in the changes observed
in the kcat,app and Km,app values for the S182A, S186A, and S182A/S186A mutants.

Conclusions
We determined that D. melanogaster AANATA will catalyze the formation of N-acylarylalkylamides
from a broad array of corresponding acyl-CoA and arylalkylamine substrates.
These data validate the potential role of N-acyltransferases
in fatty acid amide biosynthesis and provide structure–activity
data for the future development of inhibitors to this class of enzymes.
A chemical mechanism for AANATA, consistent with all the data available
for this enzyme,21,37 is illustrated in Scheme 1. Substrate binding is sequential ordered with acetyl-CoA
binding first, meaning that catalysis occurs only after the formation
of an AANAT·acetyl-CoA·arylalkylamine ternary complex. We
identified Glu-47 as the general base involved in the water-assisted
deprotonation of the positively charged amino group of the donor substrate
via an active site “proton wire”. The deprotonation
of a species with a pKa,app of 9.8 was
attributed to the formation of the tightly bound CoA thiolate. Finally,
our mutagenesis data suggest that protein dynamics regulate substrate
binding and catalysis in AANATA. The active site amino acids, Asp-46,
Pro-48, Arg-153, and His-220, seem to be critical to the regulatory
dynamics of the enzyme.
