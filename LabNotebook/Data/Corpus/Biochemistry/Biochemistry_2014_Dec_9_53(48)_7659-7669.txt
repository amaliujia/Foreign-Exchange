Pif1 is a helicase involved in the
maintenance of nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes in eukaryotes. Here we report a new activity of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae Pif1, annealing of complementary DNA strands.
We identified preferred substrates for annealing as those that generate
a duplex product with a single-stranded overhang relative to a blunt
end duplex. Importantly, we show that Pif1 can anneal DNA in the presence
of ATP and Mg2+. Pif1-mediated annealing also occurs in
the presence of single-stranded DNA binding proteins. Additionally,
we show that partial duplex substrates with 3′-single-stranded
overhangs such as those generated during double-strand break repair
can be annealed by Pif1.

Helicases
are defined as a class
of proteins that move directionally on nucleic acids (NA) separating
the strands of duplex NA using the energy of NTP hydrolysis (reviewed
in refs (1−4)). However, an increasing number of helicases have
been shown to anneal or rewind complementary strands of oligonucleotides
in the presence or absence of ATP.5−11 Annealing helicases are proposed to use their strand annealing activity
for stabilization of stalled replication forks, double-strand break
(DSB) repair, telomere metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and regulation
of transcription (reviewed in ref (12)).

A number of helicases have been shown
to exhibit strand annealing
activity, including all five members of the human RecQ family (reviewed
in ref (13)), Dna2,14 TWINKLE,9 and UvsW.15 HARP and AH2 are the only two DNA helicases
that are known to have a requirement for ATP for strand annealing
activity.8,16

Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pif1 is known to participate
in both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA replication where its translocation
on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis.17 Pif1 has been shown to dimerize upon DNA binding.18 However, the monomeric form translocates on
ssDNA, unwinds double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), albeit with an efficiency
lower than that of a dimer, and has been proposed to be involved in
protein displacement.19 Pif1 is involved
in several processes that are essential for DNA replication such as
Okazaki fragment maturation and replication through G-quadruplex motifs
and through replication fork barriers in rDNA (reviewed in ref (20)). Pif1 has been shown
to interact with the single-stranded DNA binding protein Rim1, an
important component of the yeast mitochondrial DNA replication complex.21 Pif1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage,22 which may direct it to stalled replication forks.
Overexpression of Pif1 decreases the rate of cell growth and causes
increased levels of formation of Mre11 and Rfa1 foci, indicative of
DNA damage, in both telomeric and nontelomeric regions.23 Pif1 is involved in break-induced repair (BIR)24−26 as well as recombination-dependent telomere maintenance in the absence
of telomerase.27

Strand annealing
activity of annealing helicases has been implicated
in DNA DSB repair mechanisms.12 There are
three main pathways that repair DSBs: classical nonhomologous end
joining (cNHEJ), alternative nonhomologous end joining (aNHEJ), which
is also called microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), and homologous
recombination (HR).28 The cNHEJ pathway
involves direct ligation of the broken ends. Both HR and aNHEJ/MMEJ
require broken end resection that generates 3′-ssDNA tails,
relying on annealing of complementary ssDNA to complete the repair
process. Several helicases that are known to participate in DSB repair
are also known to possess strand annealing activity.29−34

Some helicases implicated in telomere metabolism are known
to possess
strand annealing activity,14,35−37 including human Pif1.7,38 It is well established that Pif1
functions as a negative regulator of telomere length.39−42 The single-stranded telomeric overhang may require the strand annealing
activity of an annealing helicase to form a more stable structure
such as a T-loop.

Importantly, annealing activity exhibited
by a helicase must be
accounted for to interpret biochemical results. Annealing can compete
with DNA unwinding to affect the outcome of DNA unwinding experiments in vitro.43 Therefore, understanding
the biochemical mechanism for annealing is necessary for the interpretation
of helicase unwinding activity.

Experimental Procedures
Oligonucleotides
and Proteins
DNA oligonucleotides
were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, purified using denaturing
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis,44 quantified
by UV absorbance using calculated extinction coefficients,45 and radiolabeled as described previously.46 The nuclear isoform of yeast Pif1 and yeast
Rim1 were purified as described previously.21 Yeast RPA was a generous gift from M. Wold. Dextran sulfate (molecular
weight of 6500–10000 Da) from Sigma was dialyzed extensively
against water to remove sodium.

DNA Unwinding Assay
All concentrations listed are after
initiation of the DNA unwinding reaction. Unwinding experiments were
performed at 25 °C in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (sodium
salt) (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2
mM β-ME, and 0.1 mg/mL BSA. Reaction mixtures contained 2 nM
DNA substrate and 5 mM ATP, and reactions were initiated upon addition
of 200 nM Pif1 and 60 nM DNA trap complementary to the unlabeled strand.
Reactions were quenched with 200 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol
blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 6% glycerol, and 112 mM T70 (in
nucleotides) to sequester proteins after the reaction. The substrate
and ssDNA product were resolved on a 20% native polyacrylamide gel,
detected using a PhosphorImager, and quantified using ImageQuant.
The amount of product formed over time was plotted and fit to a single
exponential.

Strand Annealing Assay
Pairs of
complementary ssDNA
substrates that were used for annealing assays are listed in Table 1. The annealing experiments were performed at 25
°C in a reaction buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (sodium salt)
(pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM β-ME, and 0.1 mg/mL
BSA. All concentrations listed are final, after initiation of the
reaction. The two complementary strands with one of them radiolabeled
were mixed with 200 nM Pif1 (unless otherwise indicated in the figure
legend) to initiate the reaction. For some experiments, ATP and MgCl2 were added with the Pif1. The ratio of radiolabeled ssDNA
(2 nM) to unlabeled complementary ssDNA (2.6 nM) used for the assay
was 1:1.3. Aliquots of the reaction were quenched at the indicated
times with 200 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 nM DNA trap, and 5 mg/mL dextran
sulfate, which serves as a protein trap because of its polyanionic
nature. Samples were immediately loaded on a native 20% polyacrylamide
gel. The amounts of annealed DNA and ssDNA were quantified using a
PhosphorImager and ImageQuant. Spontaneous annealing was determined
by excluding the enzyme in the assay mixture. Data were fit to the
simplest annealing mechanism that could account for the data (Schemes 1–3) using KinTek Explorer,47 where S1 and S2 are the two complementary strands
of ssDNA and P is the duplex DNA product. In the absence of ATP, reactions
with some substrates did not go to completion, suggesting an equilibrium
between different substrate conformations as shown in Scheme 1. For reactions that included ATP, a simple annealing
mechanism (Scheme 2) was used to fit the data.
For reactions in which the product contained a 5′-ssDNA overhang
and ATP was present, the reverse reaction (unwinding) was also included
(Scheme 3). The
rate constant kS1–S is associated
with conversion of substrate (S1) to a conformation that is not capable
of annealing, and kS–S1 is the
rate constant for the conversion of S to S1. kS–S1 was not well-defined but does not affect the rate
constant for annealing. The second-order rate constant for annealing
is kan, and the rate constant for unwinding
is kun.

Förster
Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assay for Binding
5′-Cy3-labeled
and 3′-Cy5-labeled, noncomplementary,
eight-nucleotide oligonucleotides were incubated in buffer [25 mM
HEPES (sodium salt) (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM β-ME,
and 0.1 mg/mL BSA] at a final concentration of 100 nM each in a fluorometer
maintained at 25 °C with a circulating water bath. Samples were
excited at 550 ± 2 nm, and emission was monitored at 668 ±
4 nm. The oligonucleotide sequences were 5′-GTCACACT-Cy5-3′
and 5′-Cy3-AGCATCAG-3′. Pif1 was titrated into the solution
containing one or both oligonucleotides. The increase in fluorescence
corresponds to the increase in the level of FRET due to addition of
Pif1. The change in fluorescence emission of samples titrated with
Pif1 was corrected for sample dilution by subtracting the change in
the fluorescence emission of oligonucleotide samples titrated with
equal volumes of protein sample buffer.

Results
Removing the
DNA Trap from an Unwinding Reaction Mixture Results
in a Reduced Level of Product Formation
A likely role for
Pif1 in promoting strand annealing activity was identified when an
unwinding experiment showed a disparity in product formation with
or without a DNA trap (Figure 1). Pif1-catalyzed
unwinding experiments were performed in the presence or absence of
a DNA trap that captures the unlabeled displaced strand, leaving the
unwound radiolabeled strand as the ssDNA product. Less ssDNA was observed
from Pif1-catalyzed unwinding of the 70T-30bp substrate when the DNA
trap was not included (Figure 1b). In the absence
of a DNA trap, the amount of ssDNA generated reached a plateau at
∼50%, suggesting that the unwound products were reannealed
and an equilibrium had been reached between unwinding and reannealing
activities, as has been shown previously for WRN and BLM helicases.48 These results suggest that Pif1 might promote
strand annealing.

Figure 1 Pif1-catalyzed unwinding yielded differential product
appearance
in the presence or absence of DNA trap. (a) Duplex DNA substrate was
mixed with Pif1 in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 to form
ssDNA product. A DNA trap complementary to the unlabeled strand was
included in some reactions. (b) Unwinding experiments were initiated
by mixing 2 nM 70T-30bp substrate, ATP, and MgCl2 with
200 nM Pif1. Reactions were performed either in the absence (triangles)
or in the presence (squares) of unlabeled 60 nM DNA trap. Fitting
the data to the equation for a single exponential resulted in unwinding
rate constants of 0.80 ± 0.02 and 1.3 ± 0.04 min–1 for unwinding in the presence and absence of DNA trap, respectively.
The amplitudes of the product formation curves are 0.87 ± 0.01
and 0.56 ± 0.01 for unwinding in the presence and absence of
a DNA trap, respectively.

Pif1 Promotes Strand Annealing
Pif1’s ability
to anneal complementary strands was initially investigated in the
absence of ATP and Mg2+ to eliminate the effects of unwinding.
A pair of complementary ssDNA substrates that would generate a partial
duplex product were used to test Pif1’s ability to anneal (Figure 2a). The annealed products were separated from ssDNA
on a native polyacrylamide gel (Figure 2b).
Annealing of 70T-30nt with a 30nt complementary strand generates a
70T-30bp product (Table 1). Approximately 80%
of the 70T-30bp product was formed in &lt;2 min, whereas no product
formation was observed in the absence of the enzyme during the time
period of the reaction (Figure 2c), indicating
Pif1 can promote annealing of complementary strands.

Figure 2 Pif1 exhibited robust
strand annealing activity in the absence
of ATP and MgCl2. (a) Schematic illustration for two partially
complementary ssDNAs (70T-30nt and 30nt CS) annealing to generate
a partial duplex DNA, 70T-30bp. Pif1 (200 nM) was incubated with 70T-30nt
(2.6 nM) and 30nt CS (2 nM) for increasing times, and the reactions
were stopped by mixing with a quench solution containing 200 mM EDTA,
1% SDS, 100 nM DNA trap, and 5 mg/mL dextran sulfate. (b) Representative
gel images of annealed products formed in the presence of Pif1 (top)
and in the absence of Pif1 (bottom) as a function of time. (c) Fraction
of ssDNA annealed in the presence of Pif1 (circles). Spontaneous annealing
was measured in the absence of Pif1 (diamonds). Error bars represent
the standard deviation of three independent experiments.

Pif1 Can Bind Multiple Oligonucleotides Simultaneously
A FRET binding experiment was designed to investigate the ability
of Pif1 to simultaneously bind multiple DNA strands (Figure 3a). Like other superfamily 1 helicases, Pif1 sequesters
approximately eight nucleotides on the basis of a repeating pattern
of nucleotide protection of approximately eight nucleotides in the
presence of Pif1 in KMnO4 footprinting experiments (Figure
S1 of the Supporting Information), so the
ability of Pif1 to concurrently bind multiple oligonucleotides was
investigated using Cy3- and Cy5-labeled noncomplementary 8-mers because
these should bind to Pif1 with a 1:1 stoichiometry when considering
only the helicase binding site. Upon titration of a mixture of the
Cy3- and Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides with Pif1, FRET should be observed
if multiple oligonucleotides bind to a single Pif1 molecule or to
adjacent Pif1 molecules in a Pif1 oligomer (Figure 3a). Pif1 has been reported to dimerize in the presence of
DNA.18 If each Pif1 monomer in the dimer
binds a separate oligonucleotide, the FRET probes should be in the
proximity. Alternatively, sites on the surface of Pif1 could interact
with additional DNA molecules to juxtapose the fluorophores. We find
that Pif1 is able to bind multiple oligonucleotides simultaneously,
resulting in an increased FRET efficiency (Figure 3b), similar to that observed previously for hepatitis C virus
NS349 and human Rad52.50 A similar increase in the FRET efficiency was observed
when the concentration of DNA (2 nM) was the same as that used in
the annealing experiments (Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information). This activity provides a mechanism by which Pif1
can increase the local concentration of two DNA strands, which should
facilitate annealing.

Figure 3 Pif1 can bind multiple strands of DNA. (a) Schematic illustration
of fluorescence titration. Two noncomplementary 8-mer oligonucleotides
(100 nM) were mixed and then titrated with Pif1. Fluorescence emission
was measured at 668 nm with excitation at 550 nm. (b) Increase in
Cy5 fluorescence emission as a function of Pif1 concentration (blue).
Data were fit to the Hill equation to obtain the concentration of
protein at which half of the maximal FRET change is observed, 200
nM Pif1, and the Hill coefficient of 2.1. Duplicate experiments produced
similar results. No increase in fluorescence was observed in control
reactions in which Pif1 was added to only the Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide
(red) or only the Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide (black).

Substrate Preference for Annealing by Pif1
The effect
of changes in the length and type of ssDNA overhangs, such as a short
overhang versus a long overhang, a 3′-overhang versus a 5′-overhang,
and one versus two overhangs, on Pif1-promoted strand annealing was
investigated. Several substrates (Table 1)
that would generate a 30bp duplex product (Figure 4a) with varying length overhangs were tested in the absence
of ATP and Mg2+ to eliminate complicating effects of unwinding
(Figure 4b). Data were fit to the annealing
mechanism in Scheme 1. The constants obtained
from the fit are listed in Table 2. The second-order
rate constant for annealing is similar for each of the substrate pairs.
What varies between the substrates is the fraction of substrate that
is available for annealing, indicated by the rate constant for conversion
of S1 to S, where S is substrate that is in a conformation that is
not amenable to annealing. (A similar process could occur with S2.
However, we included this only for one of the substrate strands to
limit the number of variables in the fit and use the simplest mechanism
possible to fit the data.) S could be some conformation in which the
bases are not fully exposed because of short regions of base pairing
within the substrate or the potential sequestration of bases by an
excess of Pif1 bound to the substrate. A modest difference in the
fraction of ssDNA annealed is observed for the products containing
a 5′-overhang or 3′-overhang, with the 5′-overhang
being the preferred product. In general, longer substrates are preferred
(Figure 4b), but the length is not the only
factor that influences annealing. Two different products, each containing
two 20nt ssDNA overhangs, were compared. The forked duplex (cyan diamonds)
has a ssDNA overhang on the 5′-end of one strand and the 3′-end
of the other. The dual 5′-overhang product has 20nt ssDNA overhangs
on each 5′-end (black triangles). The dual 5′-overhang
product is formed preferentially over the forked product even though
the total length of the substrates and overhangs is equivalent, again
indicating that 5′-overhangs are preferred. The dual-5′-overhang
product (two 20T overhangs) is annealed similarly to a product with
a single 70T 5′-overhang even though the total length is reduced,
indicating that the location of overhangs is important, in addition
to total length. Although the ratio of Pif1 to DNA strands is the
same for each of the substrate pairs utilized, the ratio of Pif1 to
binding sites varies significantly between the substrate pairs due
to the variation in substrate length. We note that the substrate preference
reported at saturating enzyme concentrations may not be applicable
when the enzyme concentration is not saturating because of the difference
in the number of binding sites.

Figure 4 Effect of varying ssDNA overhangs and
Pif1 concentrations on annealing.
(a) DNA substrates that can anneal to form a 30bp duplex are shown
with the varying 5′- and 3′-overhangs indicated. The
substrates are named according to the length and type (5′ or
3′) of ssDNA overhang and the length of duplex. They are shown
in order from the most efficiently to least efficiently annealed.

(×), and 20T/20T dual 5′-overhangs (▼). Error bars

Data were fit to Scheme 1, and the constants
from the fits are listed in Table 2. (c) Annealing

experiments produced similar results. Data were fit to Scheme 1 to obtain the second-order rate constant for annealing
and the rate constant for conversion of S1 to S (1.9 × 107 M–1 s–1 and 0.022 s–1 for a 100:1 Pif1:DNA ratio, 1.9 × 107 M–1 s–1 and 0.037 s–1 for a 50:1 Pif1:DNA ratio, and 4.4 × 106 M–1 s–1 and 0.030 s–1 for a 5:1
Pif1:DNA ratio, respectively). Data obtained at 1:1 and 1:5 Pif1:DNA
ratios and in the absence of Pif1 were not fit because of the small
quantities of product formed. (d) Annealing of the 30bp blunt end

experiments produced similar results. Data were fit to Scheme 1 to obtain the second-order rate constant for annealing
and the rate constant for conversion of S1 to S (1.5 × 107 M–1 s–1 and 0.14 s–1 for a 100:1 Pif1:DNA ratio, 1.5 × 107 M–1 s–1 and 0.14 s–1 for a 50:1 Pif1:DNA ratio, and 1.1 × 107 M–1 s–1 and 0.078 s–1 for a 5:1
Pif1:DNA ratio, respectively). Data obtained at 1:1 and 1:5 Pif1:DNA
ratios and in the absence of Pif1 were not fit because of the small
quantities of product formed.

Effect of Enzyme Concentration on Annealing
Annealing
experiments, thus far, included a large excess of Pif1 relative to
DNA, similar to that present in the unwinding reaction mixtures shown
in Figure 1 that initially indicated that annealing
might be occurring. If Pif1 oligomerization is involved in annealing,
then annealing activity should decrease if the Pif1:DNA ratio is decreased.
Panels c and d of Figure 4 show the results
of varying the quantity of Pif1 relative to the ssDNA substrates.
The level of product formation (70T-30bp) increases dramatically when
the Pif1 concentration is increased to a level 50–100-fold
greater than the DNA concentration (Figure 4c). When the Pif1:DNA ratio is varied with the 30bp blunt end duplex
(Figure 4d), the level of product formation
is again low when Pif1 and the DNA are present at similar concentrations.
However, more product was observed when only a small excess of Pif1
(5:1) was present than when a large excess of Pif1 was present (100:1).
This suggests that when excess Pif1 is present with ssDNA substrates
that can anneal to form a blunt end product, the excess enzyme may
sequester the bases and actually slow annealing relative to a small
excess of enzyme, although annealing by the presence of a large excess
of Pif1 is still enhanced relative to spontaneous annealing. These
results suggest that sequestration of the duplex-forming region by
Pif1 can have two effects. Pif1 binding can prevent annealing due
to sequestration of the DNA. This is illustrated by the results in
Figure 4d that show that more blunt end duplex
product is formed at a 5:1 Pif1:DNA ratio than at a 50:1 or 100:1
ratio. Second, binding of enzyme to the duplex-forming region can
perpetuate annealing because of the enzyme’s ability to promote
annealing. When the product has a ssDNA overhang, increasing the Pif1
concentration increases the level of annealing (Figure 4c), likely because of the increased number of binding sites
on the substrates requiring a higher Pif1:DNA ratio to result in sufficient
Pif1 binding in or near the complementary regions of the substrates.
However, when the product is a blunt end duplex, that ratio is more
complicated because all binding events sequester annealing sites (Figure 4d). Binding events on substrates that will anneal
to form products with overhangs sequester regions that are not necessarily
annealing sites, whereas all binding events on substrates that will
anneal to form blunt end duplexes sequester annealing sites. Because
of the difference in the number of binding sites for the enzyme on
the two sets of substrate pairs, it is difficult to compare the rates
and quantities of product formed at the various Pif1:DNA ratios because
the quantity of Pif1 required to saturate the sets of substrate pairs
is different.

Effect of ATP and Mg2+ on Annealing
by Pif1
Helicases hydrolyze ATP, so the strand annealing
activity was examined
under conditions in which strand separation can also occur. Annealing
by Pif1 was tested in the presence or absence of ATP in the presence
of MgCl2 using the 70T-30bp product (Figure 5). After the initial rapid phase, the level of product formation
reached a plateau, indicating that unwinding and annealing were at
equilibrium. This is similar to previous observations with Dda helicase
in which the annealing product serves as a substrate for strand separation.43 Data collected in the presence of ATP and Pif1
were fit to Scheme 3 to obtain a second-order
rate constant of (5.1 ± 0.3) × 106 M–1 s–1 for annealing and a rate constant of 0.021
± 0.004 s–1 for unwinding. Data collected in
the absence of ATP but in the presence of Pif1 were fit to Scheme 1, and a second-order rate constant of (1.3 ±
0.2) × 107 M–1 s–1 for annealing was obtained. In the absence of Pif1, data were fit
to Scheme 2, and the second-order rate constants
for annealing were (1.7 ± 0.9) × 105 and (5.8
± 0.3) × 105 M–1 s–1 in the presence and absence of ATP, respectively. The reduced spontaneous
annealing rate in the presence of ATP is likely due to sequestration
of Mg2+ by ATP, thereby weakening the ability of Mg2+ to stabilize the duplex. Notably, Pif1 enhances the spontaneous
annealing rate 20-fold in the absence of ATP and 30-fold in the presence
of ATP.

Shown are the kinetic plots observed for Pif1 (200 nM) catalyzed annealing
of 70T-30nt (2 nM) and 30nt CS (2.6 nM) to generate 70T-30bp in the
presence (blue) or absence (red) of 5 mM ATP. Control reaction mixtures
in the presence (green) or absence (black) of ATP lacked Pif1. All
reaction mixtures contained 10 mM MgCl2. Data collected
in the presence of ATP and Pif1 were fit to Scheme 3 to obtain a second-order rate constant of (5.1 ± 0.3)
× 106 M–1 s–1 for
annealing and a rate constant of 0.021 ± 0.004 s–1 for unwinding. Data collected in the absence of ATP but in the presence
of Pif1 were fit to Scheme 1, and a second-order
rate constant of (1.3 ± 0.2) × 107 M–1 s–1 for annealing and a rate constant of 0.094
± 0.004 s–1 for conversion between S1 and S
were obtained. In the absence of Pif1, data were fit to Scheme 2, and the second-order rate constants for annealing
were (1.7 ± 0.9) × 105 and (5.8 ± 0.3) ×
105 M–1 s–1 in the
presence and absence of ATP, respectively.

Effect of Duplex Length on Annealing by Pif1
Pif1-promoted
strand annealing experiments in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 using 70T-30bp (Figure 5) product showed
that the unwinding and annealing activities of Pif1 reached equilibrium.
It is well-established that Pif1 has relatively low processivity for
unwinding,17,19 suggesting that an increase in
duplex length should shift the equilibrium toward annealing. In addition,
substrates that would generate an annealed product that is a blunt
end duplex or has a 3′-ssDNA overhang should produce more product
in an annealing reaction because the product should not be unwound
by the 5′-to-3′ helicase activity of Pif1. To test this,
two complementary ssDNAs that can generate an 80bp blunt DNA product
were used (Figure 6a). Pif1 strand annealing
activity in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 led to nearly
complete annealing of the substrates (Figure 6b) relative to annealing of substrates that produce a product that
could be readily unwound (Figure 5). The rate
constant for annealing based on a fit of the data to a simple annealing
mechanism (Scheme 2) is 3.0 × 106 M–1 s–1. When ATP was absent,
the second-order rate constant for annealing was 2.9 × 107 M–1 s–1. Faster annealing
in the absence of ATP suggests that even though the final product
of the annealing reaction is not a substrate for Pif1 unwinding, a
partially annealed intermediate could be a substrate for unwinding
by Pif1. Spontaneous strand annealing was observed for formation of
the 80bp blunt DNA product, with a rate constant of 3.0 × 105 M–1 s–1. This is similar
to previous DNA hybridization rate measurements of 2.0 × 105 to 1.2 × 106 M–1 s–1, depending on the sequence.51 However, annealing by Pif1 was 10-fold faster than spontaneous annealing.

by Pif1 in the absence of ATP but in the presence of MgCl2 is shown as green squares. Spontaneous annealing in the absence
of enzyme in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 was also measured
(blue diamonds). Data were fit to a simple annealing mechanism (Scheme 2) to obtain second-order rate constants for annealing
of 3.0 × 106 M–1 s–1 in the presence of Pif1 and ATP, 2.9 × 107 M–1 s–1 in the presence of Pif1 but
in the absence of ATP, and 3.0 × 105 M–1 s–1 in the absence of Pif1.

Pif1 Promotes Annealing of Partial Duplexes with 3′-Overhangs
Repair of double-strand breaks in cells can occur by various pathways,
most of which involve resection by a nuclease, resulting in complementary
3′-overhangs. Two partial duplex substrates (each containing
30bp and a 30nt 3′-ssDNA overhang) (Figure 7a) were used to investigate the ability of Pif1 to catalyze
annealing of such substrates. These substrates are similar to those
that could occur during double-strand break repair by the aNHEJ or
MMEJ pathway, although sequences involved in aNHEJ often contain regions
of noncomplementarity within the region to be annealed. In the absence
of enzyme, very little annealing was observed; however, in the presence
of Pif1, annealing was much more rapid (Figure 7b). During double-strand break repair, after end resection, the resulting
ssDNA is thought to be coated by single-stranded DNA binding proteins.
Because Pif1 is involved in genome maintenance in both the yeast nucleus
and mitochondria, the ability of Pif1 to anneal in the presence of
yeast RPA, the nuclear single-stranded DNA binding protein, and Rim1,
the yeast mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein, was investigated
(Figure 7b). Annealing was similar in the presence
and absence of single-stranded DNA binding proteins with rate constants
of 9.2 × 106, 1.5 × 107, and 4.8 ×
106 M–1 s–1 for annealing
by Pif1 alone, Pif1 and RPA, and Pif1 in the presence of Rim1, respectively.
No annealing was observed by Rim1, but RPA alone annealed like Pif1
alone with a rate constant of 1.2 × 107 M–1 s–1. Spontaneous annealing was negligible within
this time frame. The ability of Pif1 to anneal substrates with 3′-overhangs
in the presence of single-stranded DNA binding proteins suggests that
Pif1 annealing activity could function in processes such as double-strand
break repair in addition to its known role in the regulation of telomerase
at DSBs39−42 and its recent description in BIR.24−26

(1.2 × 107 M–1 s–1). (c) Schematic illustration for strand annealing experiments using

was also measured (triangles). Data were fit to a simple annealing
mechanism (Scheme 2) to obtain a second-order
rate constant for annealing by Pif1 (4.1 × 106 M–1 s–1).

Human RPA has been shown to both inhibit and stimulate spontaneous
strand annealing depending on the substrate type.52 Yeast RPA also appears to stimulate annealing of some substrates
(Figure 7b), but with other substrates and
conditions, annealing is inhibited by RPA.53,54 RPA has been previously shown to have varying effects on annealing
depending on the specific substrate. Annealing by Rad52 is inhibited
by yeast RPA on unstructured DNA substrates, but RPA stimulated Rad52
annealing of denatured plasmid DNA, suggesting that RPA may eliminate
secondary structures in DNA to enhance annealing by Rad52.53 The differential effect of RPA on the annealing
activity of different substrates may be related to the ability of
RPA to remove secondary structure. It appears that yeast RPA, like
human RPA, can either inhibit or stimulate annealing of complementary
DNA, depending on the specific sequence and conditions.

Repair
by the aNHEJ pathway often involves annealing of two partially
complementary ssDNAs. Therefore, annealing of 3′-overhang partial
duplex substrates with a 4nt mismatch in the middle of the otherwise
homologous overhangs (Figure 7c) was investigated
(Figure 7d). These substrates may approximate
those that are annealed during repair by the aNHEJ pathway, although
the length of the complementary regions and the degree of mismatch
could vary from those used here. Annealing of substrates with a mismatch
in the complementary overhang by Pif1 occurred at a rate of 4.1 ×
106 M–1 s–1, which
is similar to the rate constant for annealing fully complementary
sequences of similar length (Figure 7b), suggesting
a possible role for Pif1 in repair of sequences with partial homology.

Discussion
Pif1 showed robust annealing of 30nt DNAs in
the absence of ATP
and MgCl2 (Figures 2 and 4). There are many factors that influence the quantity
of product formed in an annealing reaction. First, the position of
the ssDNA tail on the product affects annealing with overhangs on
the 5′-end preferred (Figure 4b). Second,
the ratio of Pif1 to binding sites on the DNA influences annealing
as seen by the inhibition of annealing of the 30bp duplex at very
high Pif1:DNA ratios (Figure 4d). The rate
and amplitude of product formed vary depending on the ratio of enzyme
to binding sites. Finally, the inherent ability of the enzyme to melt
the dsDNA product influences the quantity of annealed product formed
(Figure 5). In the presence of ATP and MgCl2 (Figure 5), the reaction reached an
equilibrium between unwinding and annealing. Pif1’s strand
annealing activity in the presence of ATP and MgCl2 was
more efficient with longer duplex substrates (Figure 6). This is likely because of the decreased level of unwinding
due to the nonprocessive nature of Pif117,55 resulting
in the equilibrium between unwinding and annealing being shifted further
toward annealing. These results indicate that the antagonizing functions
of Pif1 could be regulated by the type of substrate it processes.

Human Pif1 has been shown to have annealing activity.7,38 It is possible that many Pif1 family members might possess strand
annealing functions in a manner similar to that of the RecQ family
helicases (reviewed in ref (13)). Members of the Pif1 and RecQ families are known to participate
in some of the same biological processes, such as telomere regulation,
Okazaki fragment maturation, homologous recombination, G-quadruplex
processing, and DNA repair.34,56 It is possible that
coordinated unwinding and annealing activities of these two helicase
families are required to achieve some of their biological functions.

The mechanism of strand annealing by helicases and its biological
consequences remain largely unknown. An important question is how
two competing activities of the same helicase are regulated. A simple
view is that an annealing helicase has to perform either unwinding
or annealing depending on the specific biological function and the
type of substrate encountered; it could be regulated by the microenvironment
at the site of action. Alternatively, a coordinated action of unwinding
and annealing activities may be required to achieve the necessary
biological function. Several possible mechanisms have been proposed
to regulate helicase annealing activity, such as the presence of an
annealing domain, protein oligomerization, ATP hydrolysis as a switch
between unwinding and annealing, interactions of helicases with other
proteins, and post-translational modification of the helicase.12 Pif1 is known to be phosphorylated in response
to DNA damage,22 and the effect of this
modification on the equilibrium between unwinding and annealing is
unknown.

Because Pif1 binds to ssDNA, there are two types of
substrates
on which Pif1 might act: either 5′-ssDNA tails or 3′-ssDNA
tails. Pif1 is a 5′-to-3′ helicase, so its helicase
activity and annealing activity are expected to be in competition
on substrates with 5′-ssDNA tails. On substrates with 3′-ssDNA
tails, translocation could displace bound proteins57,58 and facilitate annealing of the resulting ssDNA. Interestingly,
most mechanisms of repair of DNA DSBs occur through generation of
3′-ssDNA tails by a 5′-to-3′ resection mechanism
(reviewed in ref (28)). Pif1 is known to participate in DSB repair22,39 and has a role in BIR.24−26 Annealing of complementary 3′-ssDNA
overhangs must occur in the final steps of DSB repair, and annealing
of 3′-ssDNA overhangs was enhanced in the presence of Pif1,
even in the presence of single-stranded DNA binding proteins (Figure 7b) or mismatches in the DNA sequence (Figure 7d).

In general, helicases are thought to unwind
DNA. However, the discovery
of annealing helicases5,10 and UvsW rewinding59 indicates duplex formation can also be catalyzed
by helicases. This rewinding activity has been proposed to play a
role in the stabilization of stalled replication forks, DNA repair,
transcription, telomere metabolism, and chromatin remodeling.12

In BIR, Pif1 has been proposed to be located
both with the polymerase
at the leading edge of the migrating D-loop and at the trailing edge
of the D-loop.24−26 The trailing Pif1 has been suggested to relieve topological
stress and displace the newly extended strand. Pif1’s ability
to anneal complementary strands provides another possible role for
Pif1 in this process. At the trailing edge of the migrating D-loop,
the newly synthesized strand must be displaced and the template strands
must reanneal. Pif1 can catalyze both of these processes.

A
biologically relevant activity of Pif1 is the unfolding of quadruplex
DNA structures that form due to folding of G-rich sequences. In the
absence of Pif1, such structures cause stalling of DNA replication,
leading to increased genomic instability.61 G-Rich sequences can spontaneously fold into quadruplex structures;
therefore, a complementary strand must anneal to the G-rich sequence
prior to refolding to form duplex DNA. The ability of Pif1 to anneal
two strands may allow the enzyme to melt quadruplex DNA, followed
by annealing of the complementary strand prior to refolding of the
quadruplex structure. In the absence of annealing, the quadruplex
structure can simply refold after Pif1-catalyzed unfolding.62 Therefore, annealing activity may be beneficial
to Pif1’s ability to unfold quadruplex structures and reduce
genomic instability. Pif1 has been suggested to be involved in alternative
lengthening of telomeres (ALT),27 a recombination-based
pathway that maintains telomeres in a telomerase-independent manner
in 10–15% of cancer cells.60 The
role for Pif1 during ALT might be related to its ability to unfold
quadruplex DNA that can form from telomeric sequences, followed by
rapid annealing of the G-rich telomeric strand to the complementary
C-rich strand.

Annealing of complementary single strands is
a common observation
for DNA binding proteins that must be interpreted with caution. DNA
in single-stranded form can exhibit greatly varying degrees of intramolecular
interactions that can reduce the rate of intermolecular base pairing.
Different sequences have different rates of spontaneous annealing.51 Therefore, it is expected that a large variation
of annealing rates exists. Hence, the ability of a protein that binds
to single-stranded DNA to catalyze annealing, versus melting, will
depend on the sequence and the strength of the protein–DNA
interaction. Furthermore, proteins that have multiple binding sites
on their surface are likely to exhibit complex behavior when encountering
complementary single-stranded DNA. An example of such complex behavior
is exhibited by the RPA protein. Both human52 and yeast53 RPA can stimulate or inhibit
annealing in vitro depending on the type of substrate
and conditions. It is feasible that Pif1 and other positively charged
enzymes simply act as chemical attractants of negatively charged DNA.
However, even if the enhancement in annealing of ssDNA strands by
Pif1 is simply a result of Pif1 binding and bringing multiple strands
into the proximity of each other, this could still be relevant within
a cell.

Aside from its biological implications, an understanding
of the
strand annealing activity of Pif1 is essential for the appropriate
design of biochemical experiments. As shown in Figure 1, if unwinding experiments are performed in the absence of
a DNA trap to capture the unlabeled displaced strand, the amplitude
of the product formation curve is reduced. This reduction in amplitude
could be interpreted as inefficient unwinding if annealing is not
considered. Design and interpretation of experiments to measure DNA
unwinding by Pif1 should take into account this enzyme’s ability
to facilitate annealing of complementary strands.
