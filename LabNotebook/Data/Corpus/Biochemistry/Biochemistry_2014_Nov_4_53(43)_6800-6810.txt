The bleomycins
are a family
of glycopeptide antitumor antibiotics originally isolated from Streptomyces verticillus in 1966 by Umezawa and his
colleagues. The selective cytotoxicity
of bleomycins toward tumor cells has led to their clinical use in
the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas and malignant lymphomas.− The cytotoxic activity of bleomycin has often been attributed to
its ability to mediate double-strand cleavage of DNA.,

The therapeutic utility of bleomycin is enhanced by its low
administered
dose, which consists of ∼5 μmoles of BLM. The very low
dose implies that bleomycin must target tumor cells selectively to
achieve its therapeutic effects, and numerous reports employing radionuclide
complexes of BLM have documented that the complexes selectively target
a variety of types of tumors.− The importance of the carbohydrate moiety to the tumor selectivity
of BLM (Figure ) was suggested by imaging
studies carried out using microbubbles to which multiple copies of
BLM derivatives had been attached covalently. Microbubbles containing attached bleomycins adhered selectively
to monolayers of cultured tumor cells; those containing the BLM aglycone
(deglycoBLM) did not.

Furthermore, carbohydrates are known to play a pivotal role
in
mediating a number of biological processes. Glycopeptides, glycolipids,
and other glycoconjugates participate in cell–cell interactions,
inflammation, fertility and development, and signal transduction.− The recognition and internalization of carbohydrate residues by
specific cell surface carbohydrate-binding proteins play a crucial
role in mediating the cellular uptake of many glycosylated natural
products and control their biological activity.

In view of the documented importance of carbohydrates
in cellular
recognition, the possible role of the carbohydrate moiety of bleomycin
in cancer cell selectivity has been explored more directly. In previous
studies, it was shown that BLM disaccharide and BLM monosaccharide, both of which
contain the carbamoylmannose moiety, could recapitulate the effects
of BLM itself in mediating the delivery of an attached dye selectively
to cancer cells. In both cases, the carbamoyl moiety of carbamoylmannose
was required to support tumor cell targeting. In order to begin to
develop a more complete understanding of the structural factors in
the carbohydrate domain that conduce to selective, potent binding
and uptake by tumor cells, a focused library of structural analogues
of the natural bleomycin disaccharide has been synthesized. Given
the importance of the carbamoyl group, this functionality was modified
and its position was altered systematically to afford a library of
seven disaccharide–dye conjugates (Figure ). The cellular targeting and uptake of the conjugates were
studied by fluorescence microscopy. These studies have better defined
the required positioning and modification of the carbamoyl group for
effective tumor cell targeting and identified specific disaccharides
having 2–4-fold improved binding/uptake in human tumor cell
lines, relative to that for the natural BLM disaccharide.

Materials and Methods
Cell Growth Conditions
A498 kidney
cancer cells (ATCC
HTB-41) and A549 lung cancer cells (ATCC CCL-185) were grown in RPMI
1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (HyClone, South Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin
mix antibiotic supplement (Cellgro, Manassas, VA). DU-145 (ATCC HTB-81)
prostate cancer cells, BxPC-3 (ATCC CRL-1687) pancreatic cancer cells,
SVR A221a (CRL-2386) normal pancreatic cells, PZ-HPV-7 (ATCC CRL-2221)
normal prostate cells, WI-38 (ATCC CCL-75) normal lung cells, and
CCD-1105 KIDTr (CRL- 2305) normal kidney cells were grown in MEM (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin mix antibiotic supplement. Cell
lines were maintained at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 and 95% air.

Fluorescence Microscopy
The cells were grown on 16-well
Lab-Tek glass chamber slides at a cell density of 5000 cells/well
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 37 °C for 48 h. When the
cell confluency reached about 70%, the cells were rinsed twice with
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the old medium was replaced with
RPMI 1640 (no phenol red). Subsequently, the dye-labeled conjugates
were added to the final desired concentration (25 μM), and incubation
of the cells was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h. Thereafter, the
cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 37
°C for 5 min. Finally, the slide was mounted with Prolong Gold
Antifade reagent (with DAPI) (Invitrogen). The fluorescent images
were obtained using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted fluorescence microscope
fitted with an AxioCam MRm camera equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp
(Sutter, Novato, CA) and a Cy5 cyanine filter (Chroma, Bellows Falls,
VT). The cells were imaged using a Zeiss EC Plan Neofluor 40×/1.3 DIC M27 oil objective, and the target cells were
counted for quantification. For comparative studies, the exposure
time and source intensity were kept identical for accurate measurements.
Three different viewing fields each containing at least 10 individual
cells were analyzed from each experiment. Numerical values representing
mean pixel intensities (arbitrary units) [per unit area of the cells]
in the viewing fields were measured to give the normalized fluorescence,
and quantification values were generated by using AxioVision 4 v 4.7.1.0
software in conjunction with the interactive measurement tool. Briefly,
regions of interest within each cell were manually outlined, and the
mean pixel intensity within the region of interest was calculated.
The mean value of pixels in a region of comparable area outside the
cells was subtracted from each measurement to account for background
intensity. The data were then collated, and final results are expressed
as mean pixel intensity ± standard error of mean per area unit.

Results
Synthesis of Disaccharide–Dye
Conjugates
The
preparation of the different disaccharide–dye conjugates began
with the synthesis of the corresponding disaccharides with attached
linkers. The general synthetic strategy adopted required the syntheses
of C-2, C-3, and C-4 O-benzylated mannose and C-3 O-benzylated altrose pyranosides (Schemes  and ). The benzylated mannose and
altrose pyranosides 14, 19, 27, and 33 were coupled to gulose monosaccharide 34() to yield the corresponding O-benzylated disaccharides 35, 47, 57, and 63, respectively. The latter
were then debenzylated and activated as the nitrophenyl carbonates
to enable the incorporation of a carbamoyl or N-methylcarbamoyl
moiety (Schemes , ). Disaccharide 53 was synthesized by
a different strategy involving the coupling of gulose monosaccharide 34() and mannose pyranoside 25 ().

The syntheses
of the C-2, C-3, C-4 modified mannose and altrose disaccharide–dye
conjugates 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 (Schemes , , ) began with the coupling of gulose glycosyl acceptor 34 and corresponding mannose 14, 19, and 27 or altrose 33 glycosyl donor to
yield C-2, C-3, and C-4 O-benzylated disaccharides 35, 47, 57, and 63 in
40–73% yields. The disaccharides
were then debenzylated by hydrogenolysis over palladium hydroxide-on-carbon
and converted to the corresponding p-nitrophenyl
carbonates 36, 48, 58, and 64 in 71–96% yields over two steps. The p-nitrophenyl carbonate was then subjected
to aminolysis with ammonia and methylamine to yield 37, 38, 49, 58, 65, and 66 in 42–92% yields. Each of the disaccharides
was converted to a glycosyl donor by a selective hydrazine acetate-mediated
deacetylation of the anomeric acetate followed by activation with
diphenyl chlorophosphate in the presence of DMAP and Et3N to yield the α-glycosyl diphenyl phosphates 39, 40, 50, 60, 67, and 68 in 17–76% yields over two steps. The glycosyl donors were then coupled with CBz-protected
linker 41() to yield linker
coupled disaccharides 42, 43, 51, 61, 69, and 70 in 39–73%
yields. The disaccharides were subjected to a one-pot deacetylation
and hydrogenolysis procedures to afford the fully deprotected linker
disaccharide conjugates, which were coupled to the dye Cy5**COOSu
(46),, to provide the dye–disaccharide conjugates 3–5 and 7–9 in
23–48% yields over two steps.

The synthesis of the C-4
modified mannose disaccharide–dye
conjugate 6 is outlined in . It began with the coupling of gulose glycosyl acceptor 34 and mannose glycosyl donor 25 to yield the
C-4 carbamoyl disaccharide 53 in 51% yield. Compound 53 was then subjected to selective hydrazine acetate-mediated
deacetylation of the anomeric acetate followed by activation with
diphenyl chlorophosphate in the presence of DMAP and Et3N to yield the α-glycosyl diphenyl phosphate 54 in 52% yield over two steps. Glycosyl
donor 54 was then coupled with CBz-protected linker 41 to yield linker coupled disaccharide 55 in
26% yield. The disaccharide 55 was subjected to a one-pot
deacetylation and hydrogenolysis to afford the fully deprotected linker
disaccharide conjugate 56, which was then coupled to
Cy5**COOSu (46) to afford the dye–disaccharide
conjugate 6 in 32% yield.

cells and PZ-HPV-7 normal prostate cells (Figures  and ), and by A498 kidney carcinoma
cells and CCD-1105 KIDTr normal kidney cells (Figures  and ) was quantified by fluorescence
imaging. As shown (Figures –), in all tumor and normal cell lines tested, the
decarbamoyl BLM disaccharide exhibited very low binding and uptake,
highlighting the importance of the carbamoyl moiety to effective cell
binding and uptake. This is in agreement with earlier studies reported
by our laboratory.,,

The binding/uptake of the disaccharide–dye
conjugates in
human kidney and lung cells was lower compared with that in human
prostate and pancreatic cancer cells; however, the overall profiles
were not dissimilar. Disaccharide conjugates having an N-methylated carbamoyl group (4, 5, and 9) generally exhibited greater binding/uptake as compared
to that of the disaccharides with unmodified carbamoyl groups (3, 6, and 8). Disaccharide conjugates
having a carbamoyl or N-methylcarbamoyl group at
the C-4 position of the d-mannose subunit (6 and 7) exhibited relatively poor binding/uptake in
all of the tumor cell lines tested, underscoring the importance of
the position and orientation of the carbamoyl group in the BLM disaccharide.
This was especially true for the BxPC-3 and A498 cancer cell lines
(Figures  and ). The
binding/uptake was higher in all tested cancer cell lines for disaccharide
conjugates 4 and 9 containing the N-methylcarbamoyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of
the d-mannose and d-altrose subunits, respectively.
All of the disaccharide–dye conjugates exhibited negligible
binding/uptake in normal cells, highlighting the role of the disaccharide
and carbamoyl moiety in the cancer cell specificity of BLM.

One interesting facet of the cellular interaction of the BLM disaccharide–Cy5**
conjugate (1) with cancer cells was found to be its temperature-dependent
binding/uptake by cultured MCF-7 cells. In order to test the generality of that observation, conjugates 1, 4, and 5 were studied at 4 and
37 °C for binding/uptake by A549 and DU-145 cancer cell lines.
As shown in Figure , all three compounds exhibited
significant cell uptake only at 37 °C.

and DU-145 cancer cell lines. The cells were treated with 25 μM

PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence imaging was
carried out with a 2 s exposure time.

Discussion
The natural disaccharide moiety in BLM composed
of l-gulose
and d-mannose subunits has been found to play an important
role in the tumor selectivity and specificity of BLM. Recent reports
have highlighted the importance of the carbamoyl group present in
the BLM disaccharide for selective tumor cell binding and uptake., The present study was undertaken to explore the effects of placement
of the carbamoyl moiety in alternative locations within the disaccharide
moiety as well as the effect of N-methylation of
the carbamoyl moiety. Seven new disaccharide–dye conjugates
were synthesized for this purpose, as outlined in Schemes  and .

As is also the case for the natural BLM disaccharide, all of the
newly synthesized disaccharides had an l-gulose monosaccharide
subunit. They differed in the position of the carbamoyl group in the d-mannose moiety. Unlike the natural disaccharide, which has
a carbamoyl group at the C-3 position of the mannose monosaccharide,
the synthesized disaccharides had (i) a carbamoyl group at the C-2
or C-4 position of the d-mannose moiety (disaccharide–dye
conjugates 3 and 6), (ii) an N-methylcarbamoyl group at the C-2, C-3, or C-4 position of the d-mannose moiety (disaccharide–dye conjugates 4, 5, and 7), or (iii) a carbamoyl or N-methylcarbamoyl group at the C-3 position of the d-altrose moiety, a C-3 epimer of d-mannose (disaccharide–dye
conjugates 8 and 9).

Initial studies
monitoring cell binding and uptake clearly showed
that the BLM disaccharide containing its carbamoyl moiety was essential
for the selective binding and uptake of BLM in tumor cells.,, The dye Cy5** was chosen as the
fluorescent probe to circumvent initially encountered problems of
autofluorescence and nonspecific cell surface binding. Cys5** is a
cyanine dye exhibiting emission wavelengths in the red or near-infrared
region. The binding/uptake of the dye itself was found to be extremely
low in cancer as well as normal cells. The broad tumor cell specificity
of the synthesized disaccharide–dye conjugates was validated
by the similarity in their uptake profiles in spite of the variation
in their uptake efficiency for the different cancer and matched normal
cell lines studied (Figures –). The decarbamoylated BLM disaccharide conjugate
(2) exhibited low uptake in all of the cell lines tested,
reiterating the importance of the carbamoyl moiety. With the exception
of disaccharide conjugate 7, the disaccharide conjugates
having an N-methylcarbamoyl group (4 and 9) exhibited greater uptake as compared to that
of the respective disaccharide conjugates having an unmodified carbamoyl
group (3 and 8). The disaccharide conjugate
related to BLM disaccharide 1 but having an N-methylated carbamoyl group (5) gave mixed results (Figures –). The role of the
disaccharide in selective targeting of cancer cells by BLM was further
substantiated by the inability of the synthesized disaccharide–dye
conjugates to bind to any of the normal human cells tested. Disaccharides 4 and 9, having a modified carbamoyl group at
the C-2 and C-3 positions of the d-mannose and d-altrose subunits, respectively, exhibited the best binding and uptake
profiles in all four cancer cell lines studied.

In common with
the results of earlier studies,, we observed little
dye associated with the cell surface of any of
the tumor cell lines studied. The lack of cell surface fluorescence
is consistent with the interpretation that internalization of the
disaccharide–dye conjugate is rapid relative to cell surface
binding. This interpretation is supported by the observation that
microbubbles whose surface had been modified by the covalent attachment
of multiple BLM or BLM disaccharide molecules bound selectively to
cultured cancer cells but could not be internalized.

Earlier studies carried by our group with trivalent
clusters of
BLM monosaccharide indicated that these trivalent saccharide–dye
conjugates were bound and internalized by six cancer cell lines (A498,
A549, BxPC-3, DU-145, BT-474, and MCF-7 cell lines) more efficiently
than that for the simple BLM monosaccharide–dye conjugate. The present study provides another strategy
for enhancing the efficiency of targeting and internalization of Cys5**
selectively in cancer cells by the use of simple sugars. It seems
likely that multivalent clusters of the more promising analogues identified
in this study would provide still more efficient delivery of attached
cargoes. Clearly, the results obtained with the seven analogues included
in the present study also suggest that additional carbamoylated sugars
may demonstrate further improvements in the efficiency of tumor cell
targeting/uptake.

In addition to their promise as vehicles for
the delivery of molecular
cargoes, such as cytotoxic agents, selectively to tumor cells the
saccharides characterized in the present study may find utility in
the characterization of the cell surface receptors responsible for
tumor cell binding and uptake of BLM saccharides. Studies aimed at
understanding the mechanism of cellular uptake are in progress.

From the perspective of drug discovery, the current findings are
of interest for two types of applications. First, it seems likely
that bleomycin analogues containing disaccharides such as 4 or 9 in lieu of the normal BLM disaccharide may exhibit
antitumor properties superior to those of BLM itself. Second, the
delivery of cytotoxic agents selectively to tumors using antibodies
is currently showing great promise as a strategy for the development
of new therapeutic regimens.− It seems possible that optimized
BLM saccharides might be able to serve the role currently assigned
to antibodies in antibody–drug conjugates. In fact, the BLM
saccharide displays the same tumor targeting properties as those of
BLM itself,, and we have recently shown that
the BLM saccharide is responsible for tumor targeting/uptake by BLM.
