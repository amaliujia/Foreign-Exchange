Some cytochrome P450 enzymes epoxidize
unsaturated substrates,
but this activity has not been described for the steroid hydroxylases.
Physiologic steroid substrates, however, lack carbon–carbon
double bonds in the parts of the pregnane molecules where steroidogenic
hydroxylations occur. Limited data on the reactivity of steroidogenic
P450s toward olefinic substrates exist, and the study of occult activities
toward alternative substrates is a fundamental aspect of the growing
field of combinatorial biosynthesis. We reasoned that human P450c17
(steroid 17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, CYP17A1), which 17- and 16α-hydroxylates
progesterone, might catalyze the formation of the 16α,17-epoxide
from 16,17-dehydroprogesterone (pregna-4,16-diene-3,20-dione). CYP17A1
catalyzed the novel 16α,17-epoxidation and the ordinarily minor
21-hydroxylation of 16,17-dehydroprogesterone in a 1:1 ratio. CYP17A1
mutation A105L, which has reduced progesterone 16α-hydroxylase
activity, gave a 1:5 ratio of epoxide:21-hydroxylated products. In
contrast, human P450c21 (steroid 21-hydroxylase, CYP21A2) converted
16,17-dehydroprogesterone to the 21-hydroxylated product and only
a trace of epoxide. CYP21A2 mutation V359A, which has significant
16α-hydroxylase activity, likewise afforded the 21-hydroxylated
product and slightly more epoxide. CYP17A1 wild-type and mutation
A105L do not 21- or 16α-hydroxylate pregnenolone, but the enzymes
21-hydroxylated and 16α,17-epoxidized 16,17-dehydropregnenolone
(pregna-5,16-diene-3β-ol-20-one) in 4:1 or 12:1 ratios, respectively.
Catalase and superoxide dismutase did not prevent epoxide formation.
The progesterone epoxide was not a time-dependent, irreversible CYP17A1
inhibitor. Our substrate modification studies have revealed occult
epoxidase and 21-hydroxylase activities of CYP17A1, and the fraction
of epoxide formed correlated with the 16α-hydroxylase activity
of the enzymes.

Cytochromes
P450c17 (steroid
17-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase, CYP17A1) and P450c21 (steroid 21-hydroxylase,
CYP21A2) catalyze key reactions in adrenal and gonadal steroid biosynthesis.1 CYP17A1 catalyzes 17α-hydroxylation needed
for cortisol synthesis and the 17,20-lyase reaction needed for androgen
production. CYP21A2 specifically catalyzes the 21-hydroxylation of
steroids required for the synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids,
such as aldosterone and cortisol. Both P450s share common substrates,
including progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, but each enzyme
yields a different product profile. Human CYP17A1 catalyzes the 17-
and 16α-hydroxylase reactions with progesterone as substrate
in a 3:1 ratio, as well as a trace of 21-hydroxylase activity.2 The small side chain of A105 favors 16α-hydroxylation,
and CYP17A1 mutation A105L reduces the portion of 16α-hydroxylation
from 25% to 10%.2−4 Conversely, human CYP21A2 catalyzes progesterone
21-hydroxylation and a trace of 16α-hydroxylation, but for CYP21A2
mutations V359A and V359G, 16α-hydroxylation accounts for 40%
and 90% of the products, respectively.5

Besides hydroxylation activities, cytochromes P450 catalyze
a variety
of other oxidative reactions including epoxidation, dehydrogenation,
deamination, dehalogenation, and heteroatom oxygenation/dealkylation.6,7 Under appropriate conditions, P450s also catalyze atypical reactions
such as cleavage of C–C bonds,8,9 Wagner–Meerwein
type rearrangements,10 Paterno–Buchi
cyclization,11 cyclopropanations,12 imidation of sulfides,13 and other chemistries. For example, CYP17A1 also catalyzes the oxidative
cleavage of the C17–C20 carbon–carbon bond in 17-hydroxysteroids,
yielding 19-carbon steroids, and cytochrome b5 selectively stimulates the rate of these 17,20-lyase reactions.14 In the presence of cytochrome b5, CYP17A1 also metabolizes about 10% of pregnenolone
to androsta-5,16-diene-3β-ol,15 which
acts as a pheromone in some species. We envisioned that these steroidogenic
P450s with 17- and/or 16α-hydroxylase activity might also demonstrate
epoxidation activity with steroid analogues containing an unsaturated
carbon–carbon bond at C-16. Here, we have introduced an alkene
in the position of the steroid substrate where these enzymes normally
hydroxylate to probe for epoxidation chemistry with pregna-4,16-diene-3,20-dione
(16,17-dehydroprogesterone, compound 1, Scheme 1) and pregna-5,16-diene-3β-ol-20-one (16,17-dehydropregnenolone,
compound 5, Scheme 2). In addition,
we employed mutations with different product distributions, CYP17A1-A105L
and CYP21A2-V359A, to determine the influence of regiochemical preferences
on epoxidase activity and product distributions.

(16,17-dehydropregnenolone-3β-acetate (compound 4, 4.65 g, 13.0 mmol) [Waterstone Technology, Carmel, IN] in tetrahydrofuran
(50 mL) was added water (10 mL) and HCl (12 N, 5 mL). After being
stirred at room temperature for 7 days, the reaction was filtered
through a cotton-plugged funnel, and the white solid was washed with
hexanes. The solid precipitate was concentrated via reduced pressure
to yield compound 5 (3.5 g, 11.1 mmol, 85% yield) as
the product. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ

was then stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture
was diluted with ether and washed with NaHCO3 (saturated
aq. solution, 50 mL). During purification via flash column chromatography
(100% hexanes to 50% ethyl acetate in hexanes), some of the Δ5,6-double bond isomerized to the Δ4,5-position,
which yielded a mixture of the less polar pregna-5,16-diene-3,20-dione
(0.45 g, 1.44 mmol, 43% yield) and the more polar pregna-4,16-diene-3,20-dione

Compound 4 (2.5 g,
7.0 mmol) was weighed in a 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with
stirrer and treated with NaOH (1.0 g, 25 mmol, 3.6 mol eq), followed
by hydrogen peroxide (30% aq., 20 mL), then methanol (5 mL). The reaction
flask was equipped with rubber septum and a balloon, and it was stirred
for 36 h. The resulting mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (100

was then stirred at room temperature and monitored by TLC until completion.
Upon completion, the mixture was diluted with ether (100 mL) and washed
with water (50 mL) and NaHCO3 (saturated aqueous solution,

Pregna-5,16-diene-3β-formyloxy-21-acetoxy-20-one
(Compound 8).16
Formic
acid (50
mL) was added to compound 5 (5 g, 19.2 mmol) in a 100
mL round-bottom flask equipped with stirrer, and the reaction was
stirred at reflux for 1 h and monitored by TLC (1:1 v/v ethyl acetate:hexanes).
The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with
water, and extracted with ether (2 × 100 mL). The formylated
intermediate (1.22 g, 3.56 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic
acid monohydrate (0.15 g, 0.79 mmol, 0.2 mol eq) were weighed in a
100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a stirrer. Isopropenyl acetate

apparatus and reflux condenser. The reaction was refluxed, and the
solution was never evaporated completely. After 20 h, the reaction
was cooled to room temperature and diluted with diethyl ether (100
mL). The solution was washed with NaHCO3 (saturated aq.
solution, 2 × 50 mL), and the organic layer was washed with brine
(2 × 25 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried with MgSO4 and concentrated via reduced pressure. A solid formed under
a vacuum, and the solid was washed with ice-cold methanol to yield
the enol acetate intermediate (0.9 g, 2.34 mmol, 66% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.04 (s, 1H), 5.82

74% yield).16 Compound 7 (92
mg, 0.20 mmol) in a 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with stirrer
was dissolved in 20 mL of acetonitrile and treated with silver acetate

General Procedure for Converting 3-Keto-Δ5,6-steroids to 3-Keto-Δ4,5-steroids
To increase
the yield of the desired 3-keto-Δ4,5-steroids after
oxidation of 3β-hydroxy-Δ5,6-steroids with
Dess–Martin periodinane, the 3-keto-Δ5,6 intermediates
(less polar) are dissolved to 0.1 M in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of methanol:dichloromethane
and treated with 0.001% (v/v) of concentrated HCl. The reaction is
stirred at room temperature for up to 1 h and purified by flash column
chromatography to yield the more polar 3-keto-Δ4,5-steroid products (compounds 1, 2, and 3).

Enzymology Studies
Plasmids
The expression
plasmids were generous gifts
obtained from the following investigators: human CYP17A1 in pCW17 and N-27-human P450-oxidoreductase (POR) in
pET2218 from Professor Walter L. Miller
(University of California, San Francisco, CA); human CYP21A2 in pET-17b
from Professor Michael R. Waterman (Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN). The construct pCW-CYP17A1-A105L was previously described.2 For the CYP21A2-V359A construct, a PCR product
was obtained using hC21V359A_S: 5′-CCA GGA GTT CTG TGA GCG
CAT GA-3′, hC21V359A_AS: 5′-CCC CCA TCC CCC GGG GCT
GCA GCC G-3′ and V60-C21V359A5 as
a template. This amplicon was digested with EcoN1and Stu1, and the
resulting 700-base pair fragment containing the desired mutation (valine
GTG codon changed to alanine GCG codon) was ligated into pET17b-CYP21A2,
which was digested with the same enzymes. All constructs were sequenced
to ensure accurate mutagenesis.

Protein Expression in Escherichia coli and
Purification
Modified human CYP17A1, WT and A105L, were expressed
in E. coli JM109 cells and purified to homogeneity
as described.2 For human CYP21A2, the membrane
anchor and basic region were replaced with MAKKTSSKGK from CYP2C3,
and both WT and mutation V359A were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity using Ni-NTA affinity
resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) after solubilization with 1% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate
as described for bovine CYP21A2.19 GroEL/ES
chaperones (pGro7 plasmid) were coexpressed with the P450s to increase
expression of active enzyme. Modified human POR was expressed in E. coli C41(DE3) cells and purified according to the previously
published procedure.2

Activity
Assays with Yeast Microsomal Enzymes
Microsomes
were prepared from a yeast strain that expresses human CYP17A1 (or
CYP21A2 or variants) and human POR, according to methods previously
described.20 Yeast microsomes (3–10
μL, 10–30 pmol) containing CYP17A1 or CYP21A2 or mutations
were incubated in 0.25 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) with
20 μM steroid and 1 mM NADPH at 37 °C for 40 min. When
required, superoxide dismutase (SOD; 100 U, Sigma) and catalase (1000
U, Sigma) were added to the incubations prior to the addition of the
NADPH. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mL of dichloromethane,
and the organic phase was collected and dried under a nitrogen flow.
Steroids were analyzed using the Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC system
with UV detector. Steroids were dissolved in 20 μL of methanol,
and 5 μL injections were resolved with a 50 mm × 2.1 mm,
2.6 μm particle size C8 Kinetex column (Phenomenex,
Torrence, CA) equipped with a guard column at a flow of 0.4 mL/min.
Aqueous methanol linear gradients were employed (27% methanol from
0 to 0.5 min, jump to 39% methanol, and gradient from 39 to 75% methanol
over 30 min). Products were identified by retention times of external
standards chromatographed at the beginning of the experiment.

Reconstituted
Activity Assays Using Purified Proteins
For CYP17A1 or CYP21A2
reconstitution with POR, yeast microsomal
lipids were used as the source of phospholipid. Control yeast microsomes
(CYMS) were prepared from strain YiV(B) transformed with empty V60
vector as described.20 CYP17A1 (20 pmol)
or CYP21A2 (30 pmol), POR (80–120 pmol), and CYMS (20 μg
protein) were added to a 2 mL polypropylene tube in 0.2 mL total reaction
volume. The contents were gently swirled and set at room temperature
for 5 min. The mixture was dissolved in 50 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) with 20 μM substrate. The resulting mixture
was mixed gently and set at 37 °C for 3 min. NADPH (1 mM) was
added, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min.
The products were extracted and chromatographed as for assays with
yeast microsomes. For incubations with the 3β-hydroxy-Δ5,6-steroid compound 5, the products were converted
to their UV-active, 3-keto-Δ4,5-homologues using
cholesterol oxidase as described.2

Mass
Spectrometry Analyses
The metabolites were analyzed
with an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DecaXP, Thermo Finnigan) coupled
with a Shimadzu HPLC system. The products 21-hydroxy-16,17-dehydroprogesterone
(compound 3), 16,17-epoxyprogesterone (compound 2), and substrate 16,17-dehydroprogesterone (compound 1) were separated on a Kinetex XB C18 column (2.1
× 50 mm, Phenomenex) with a binary mobile phase of 10% methanol
(Solvent A) and 50% methanol:49.9% acetonitrile:0.1% formic acid (Solvent
B). The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The MS was operated at a positive
electrospray mode with the following settings: capillary temperature,
325 °C; spray voltage, 5 kV; sheath gas flow, 60 (arbitrary units);
auxiliary gas, 20 (arbitrary units).

Results
Chemical Synthesis
of 16,17-Dehydroprogesterone Substrate (Compound 1) and
Product Standards
The synthetic approaches
for substrate pregna-4,16-diene-3,20-dione (16,17-dehydroprogesterone,
compound 1) and for products 16α,17-epoxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione
(16α,17-epoxyprogesterone, compound 2) and pregna-4,16-diene-21-ol-3,20-dione
(21-hydroxy-16,17-dehydroprogesterone, compound 3) are
outlined in Scheme 2. The synthesis of compound 1 started with commercially available pregna-5,16-dien-3β-acetoxy-20-one
(compound 4). The 16-position was found to be electrophilic
in acidic (and basic) conditions with a Lewis-base solvent such as
methanol. Therefore, the 3β-acetate was cleanly deprotected
by stirring in a 1:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran:water in the presence
of concentrated HCl for 7 days to yield compound 5 (16,17-dehydropregnenolone),
which was also tested as a substrate. The subsequent oxidation of
the 3β-alcohol with Dess–Martin periodinane, followed
by incomplete isomerization during purification on silica gel, yielded
compound 1. Isomerization with HCl in methanol/dicholoromethane
increases yields of 3-keto-Δ4,5-steroids (see Experimental Procedures), but yields were not optimized.
This compound would be tested as a substrate for CYP17A1 and CYP21A2,
which might epoxidize the 16,17-olefin.

The synthesis of the
epoxide product, compound 2, was achieved by epoxidizing
compound 4 with basic hydrogen peroxide, which simultaneously
epoxidized the 16,17-olefin and cleaved the 3β-acetate to afford
compound 6.21 The resulting
3-hydroxy group was oxidized with Dess–Martin periodinane,
and the 5,6-alkene was isomerized during the purification process
to yield compound 2.

The synthesis of pregna-4,16-diene-21-ol-3,20-dione
(21-hydroxy-16,17-dehydroprogesterone,
compound 3) was more challenging, because the last step
of these syntheses usually involves the oxidation of the 3β-alcohol
derived from the pregnenolone backbone. The presence of a 21-hydroxyl
group creates the problem of selectively deprotecting and oxidizing
the 3β-hydroxyl group in the presence of a 21-hydroxy group.
Thus, the synthesis of compound 3 was accomplished by
employing an orthogonal protecting group strategy. The 3β-hydroxyl
was protected as the formate, iodinating the enol acetate, and acetolysis
of the iodide with silver acetate in acetonitrile to afford acetate 8. The 3β-formate, which is more reactive than the 21-acetate,
was selectively methanolyzed to alcohol 9 with careful
monitoring by TLC. The 3β-hydroxy moiety was oxidized with Dess–Martin
periodinane to afford compound 10, and under acidic conditions
in methanol, the 21-acetate was cleaved to yield compound 3.

Metabolism of 16,17-Dehydroprogesterone (1) by
Steroid Hydroxylases
CYP17A1-Catalyzed Activities with Compound 1
The incubation of compound 1 with
yeast microsomes
containing wild-type CYP17A1 and POR led to the formation of two products
in a nearly 1:1 ratio (Figure 1). We predicted
one of the products to be 16α,17-epoxyprogesterone (compound 2), and its identification was confirmed by coelution with
authentic standard at 21 min and identical MS/MS fragmentation patterns
(Figure 2 and Figures S1–S3 of the Supporting Information). The mass spectrum of
epoxide 2 (Figure S1) contains
a molecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z = 329.2, with a single dominant fragment ion at m/z = 269.1, derived from loss of CH3COOH. Furthermore, the second, earlier-eluting product at
15.1 min coeluted with the 21-hydroxylated product (compound 3), a type of metabolic switching introduced by blocking hydroxylation
chemistry at C16 and C17. The molecular ion [M + H]+ of
compound 3 also gave m/z = 329.2, but the major fragments of m/z = 311.1 and 293.1 readily distinguished this product from compound 2 (Figure S1). Although human CYP17A1
21-hydroxylates progesterone, this 21-hydroxylase activity accounts
for &lt;5% of products,2 far less than
the large fraction of 21-hydroxylated product observed using compound 1 as substrate.

Figure 1 HPLC chromatograms of products derived from
incubations of compound 1 (16,17-dehydroprogesterone)
with wild-type CYP17A1, CYP17A1
mutation A105L, wild-type CYP21A2, or CYP21A2 mutation V359A and POR
in yeast microsomes. Products were identified by retention times of
standards chromatographed before and after samples: 1, substrate 16,17-dehydroprogesterone; 2, epoxide product
16α,17-epoxyprogesterone; 3, 21-hydroxy product
21-hydroxy-16,17-dehydroprogesterone. Ordinate scales are 0.05–0.10
AU full scale. The integrated UV-detector responses with equal amounts
of compounds 2 and 3 were within 30% (not
shown); therefore, peak integrals were not corrected to determine
product ratios.

To probe the regiochemical determinants
of 16α,17-epoxidase
activity, we used CYP17A1 mutation A105L, which has reduced 16α-hydroxylase
activity4 but enhanced 21-hydroxylase activity
with progesterone substrate.2 Incubation
of compound 1 with yeast microsomes containing CYP17A1-A105L
and POR afforded the same products as wild-type CYP17A1, but the ratio
of products corresponding to compounds 2 and 3 had changed from 1:1 to 1:5 (Figure 1). Because
mutation A105L has poor progesterone 16α-hydroxylase activity,
this result suggests that epoxidation activity at the C16–C17
olefin derives primarily from the capacity of the enzyme to perform
16α-hydroxylation. In addition, this result confirmed that CYP17A1
has intrinsic 21-hydroxylase activity, which is normally suppressed
by the presence of CYP17A1 residue A105 and the more reactive substrate
C–H bonds at C16 and C17.

CYP21A2-Catalyzed Activities
with Compound 1
We have demonstrated that CYP21A2
is a progesterone 16α-hydroxylase,
which is markedly increased with mutations that reduce the bulk of
V359.5 We therefore explored whether CYP21A2
and mutation V359A also catalyze the conversion of a Δ16-steroid olefin to its epoxide metabolite. Incubation of compound 1 with yeast microsomes containing CYP21A2 and POR yielded
primarily the 21-hydroxylated product 3, as well as a
trace of epoxide 2 for both wild-type enzyme and mutation
V359A (Figure 1 and Figures S4–S5 of
the Supporting Information). The total
yield of products for CYP21A2 was lower than for CYP17A1, and no other
metabolites were formed. Thus, all four enzymes in this study 21-hydroxylated
compound 1, whereas the fraction of epoxide product correlated
with the progesterone 16α-hydroxylase activity and was best
for enzymes with progesterone 17-hydroxylase activity as well.

Exclusion
of Nonenzymatic Reactions
Uncoupling of NADPH
oxidation from product formation during cytochrome P450 catalysis
can release hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and other reactive oxygen
species into solution, which might then react with substrates to form
products via nonenzymatic reactions. To confirm that 2 and 3 are enzyme-catalyzed products and not artifacts
from reactions with released reactive oxygen species, catalase and
superoxide dismutase were added to the incubations. The inclusion
of catalase and superoxide dismutase had no effect on product formation
(Table 1). In addition, the inhibitors ketoconazole
and abiraterone blocked product formation via CYP17A1 (Figure S6 of
the Supporting Information). These data
confirm that product formation was enzyme-catalyzed.

40 min. Data represent the mean ± standard deviation for three
experiments.

Reconstituted
Assays with Purified Proteins
To confirm
that these products were not artifacts of the yeast microsome system,
particularly for CYP21A2 with low activity, incubations were repeated
with purified proteins in reconstituted assay systems. Descriptions
of the expression and purification of human CYP21A2 using E. coli have been limited, yet the X-ray crystal structure
of bovine CYP21A2 has been reported.22 The
distribution of products from compound 1 with CYP17A1,
CYP17A1-A105L, CYP21A2, and CYP21A2-V359A were not significantly different
in reconstituted assays (Table 2) than using
yeast microsomes. The higher activity afforded with the reconstituted
assay system confirmed the small but reproducible 16α,17-epoxidase
activity of CYP21A2 with compound 1, the higher epoxidase
activity with mutation V359A, and the correlation of progesterone
16α-hydroxylase activity with epoxidation chemistry for compound 1 (Table 2). Preincubation with the
3-keto-Δ4,5-analogue of abiraterone, which binds
with high affinity to and inhibits both CYP17A123 and CYP21A2 (Figure S7A of the Supporting
Information), also abrogated CYP21A2-catalyzed metabolism of
compound 1 (Figure S7B).

Metabolism
of 16,17-Dehydropregnenolone (5) by
CYP17A1
While CYP17A1 hydroxylates the Δ4,5-steroid progesterone at three sites, the enzyme converts the Δ5,6-steroid pregnenolone exclusively to the 17-hydroxylated
product, and CYP21A2 does not use pregnenolone as a substrate. To
investigate whether CYP17A1 retains activity with a Δ5,6-pregnenolone analogue when 17-hydroxylation is prevented, compound 5 was incubated with purified CYP17A1 and POR reconstituted
with CYMS, followed by enzymatic conversion to their 3-keto-Δ4-homologues with cholesterol oxidase. These experiments yielded
both the 16α,17-epoxide and the 21-hydroxylated product in a
1:4 ratio (Table 3). CYP17A1 mutation A105L
also metabolized compound 5 to the same two products,
and the ratio decreased to 1:12. The product distribution reflects
results with compound 1, for which CYP17A1 mutation A105L
also gave a greater proportion of 21-hydroxylated product. These results
also demonstrate that CYP17A1 is capable of epoxidizing and 21-hydroxylating
substrates with a double bond at the C16–C17 position, even
if the enzyme lacks 16α- and 21-hydroxylase activities toward
the homologous, endogenous substrate lacking the extra double bond.

Substrate Binding
and Product Inhibition Properties
Substrate-Binding Spectroscopy
Titration of CYP17A1
with compound 1 elicited a typical type I substrate-binding
spectrum similar to progesterone (Figure 3A).
The presence of 16,17-double bond yielded a lower spectral change
than for progesterone, with ΔAmax about half that of progesterone (ε = 46 ± 2 mM–1 cm–1 for compound 1; ε = 94
± 3 mM–1 cm–1 for progesterone),
although with a higher affinity (Ks =
540 nM for compound 1; Ks = 740 nM for progesterone). With CYP21A2, spectral titrations gave
the opposite pattern. Progesterone bound with high affinity (Ks = 60 nM) but gave a weak spectral change (ε
= 38 ± 1 mM–1 cm–1), as was
previously reported.24 With compound 1, the magnitude of the spectral change was about twice as
great (ε = 77 ± 3 mM–1 cm–1), yet the affinity was poorer (Ks =
100 nM, Figure 3B). Compound 1 is thus similar to progesterone in its affinity for CYP17A1 and
CYP21A2 but somewhat different in its capacity to displace the axial
water molecule from the resting enzymes and to convert the heme irons
to the high-spin state.

or (B) CYP21A2 with progesterone and compound 1. Difference
spectra were obtained upon titration of 200 nM purified P450 in 0.1
M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol (v/v)
with substrates at 50–5000 nM. Plots of Δ(A392 – A420) for compound 1 and Δ(A386 – A420) for progesterone versus concentration of
substrate were fit to Michaelis–Menten equation using GraphPad
Prism (see Experimental Procedures). Insets
show individual spectra for progesterone (P4) and compound 1 at concentrations below plateau phase. The resulting Ks values were 540 nM and 60 nM for compound 1 and 740 nM and 100 nM for progesterone with CYP17A1 and CYP21A2,
respectively.

Product Inhibition with
Compound 2
Given
the electrophilic properties of epoxides, an enzyme-generated epoxide
in the active site might rapidly react with an enzymic nucleophile
and afford time-dependent enzyme inactivation during turnover. To
test for covalent binding and loss of enzyme activity, substrate 1 and epoxide 2 or progesterone control were
preincubated with CYP17A1 before dilution and activity assay with
pregnenolone substrate. After up to 40 min of preincubation, similar
to the conditions of experiments using compound 1 as
substrate, only 7–8% activity loss was observed for preincubations
with all three steroids (Figure S8 of the Supporting
Information). These results show negligible inactivation of
CYP17A1 by epoxide 2 under the experimental conditions.

Discussion
The introduction of a double bond in our
substrate analogue at
the normal site of steroid hydroxylations revealed a novel 16α,17-epoxidase
activity for CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 (Figure 1).
Control experiments in the presence of catalase and superoxide dismutase
to scavenge reactive oxygen species or with abiraterone, ketoconazole,
and the Δ4,5-analogue of abiraterone to inhibit enzyme
activity confirm that these enzymes catalyze the epoxidation reactions.

By employing CYP17A1 mutations A105L and CYP21A2 mutation V359A,
we gleaned how regiochemical patterns based on progesterone substrate
correlate with product distribution. The 16α,17-epoxidase activity
toward compound 1 correlated with progesterone 16α-hydroxylase
activity and was greatly enhanced when the enzyme also catalyzed progesterone
17-hydroxylation. Consequently, the 16α,17-epoxidase activity
is greatest for wild-type CYP17A1 and lowest for wild-type CYP21A2
(Tables 1 and 2). Nevertheless,
16α-hydroxylase activity toward the C16–C17 saturated
substrate was not an essential requirement for epoxidase activity,
as CYP17A1 also epoxidized the Δ16,17-homologue of
pregnenolone (16,17-dehydropregnenolone, compound 5,
Table 3).

For other P450-catalyzed epoxidation
reactions, the nature of the
intermediate(s) in the catalytic cycle responsible for epoxidation
has been debated. Both the iron-hydroperoxide and the iron-oxene have
been proposed as the epoxidizing species. Vaz and Coon studied the
epoxidation activity of CYP2E1 and mutation T303A, where the conserved
proton-delivery threonine has been replaced by an alanine residue.25 On the basis of the preserved epoxidation activity
of mutation T303A, they proposed that the hydroperoxy complex of the
P450 mediates the epoxidation of unactivated olefinic bonds. Dawson
and Sligar have also demonstrated that the T252A variant of P450cam,
a mutant unable to hydroxylate camphor, was able to epoxidize olefins
when treated with a second oxidant.26 These
data have been interpreted as evidence of the Fe3+-OOH
intermediate, which is proposed to be active in both electrophilic
and nucleophilic reactions; nevertheless, alternate explanations for
these observations are plausible.27,28 In fact, density
functional theory (DFT) calculations by Shaik and co-workers favored
the electrophilic iron-oxene species (“compound I”)
in the epoxidation mechanism of styrene.29 Because the substrate used in this study involves an electrophilic
carbon at the β-position of the enone involving C-16 to C-20
of compound 1, our data are consistent with the Fe3+-OOH as the intermediate,25,30 which might
start the reaction with a nucleophilic attack at C-16. We do not have
any data, however, to exclude concerted or multistep epoxidation via
the iron-oxene species favored as the canonical hydroxylating species.

The alternative site of reactivity for CYP17A1 in the vicinity
of the double bond between C-16 and C-17 in compound 1 is C-21. All enzymes studied readily 21-hydroxylated compound 1, even those with low progesterone 21-hydroxylase activity
(Tables 1 and 2). It
is likely that the reduced 16α,17-epoxidase activity of CYP17A1
mutation A105L also reflects the enhanced progesterone 21-hydroxylase
activity of this enzyme, leading to greater metabolic switching to
C-21. These data are consistent with a model in which substrate-binding
trajectories for CYP17A1 render the hydrogen atoms at C-16, C-17,
and C-21 all accessible for abstraction, but the regiochemical activities
toward any given substrate reflect the reactivity of these positions,
as well as the residence times within a critical distance from the
heme oxygen. We previously suggested that the regiochemistry of CYP17A1
primarily reflects the stability of the carbon-based radicals generated
after hydrogen atom abstraction in this part of the molecule: C-17
&gt; C-16 &gt; C-21, as carbon radical stability follows 3° &gt;
2°
&gt; 1°.5 With this model, reactivity
at C-21 is not sterically precluded but rather suppressed by the greater
reactivity at C-16 and C-17. Metabolic switching to C-21 emerged as
the primary reaction pathway when the substrate was engineered to
prevent 16α- and 17-hydroxylation, and all enzymes also epoxidized
the double bond at C-16. Our data do not allow us to determine the
relative contributions of changes in substrate trajectories and of
differences in the activation barrier for the epoxidation pathway
versus the predominant 21-hydroxylation pathway. The similar but more
disparate product distributions with compound 5 favor
the conclusion that substrate modifications are primarily uncovering
occult reactivities rather than markedly altering substrate-binding
trajectories. Energy minimization with Chem3D Software demonstrates
that the hydrogen atoms of C-21 in compound 1 are moved
slightly (0.16 Å) closer to C-17 compared to progesterone (Figure 4), but this change is small compared to the marked
increase in 21-hydroxylation.

Figure 4 Chem3D Software was used to minimize the energy
of the 16-dehydroprogesterone
(compound 1) and progesterone (MM2) structures. Progesterone
is shown in red, and compound 1 is shown in blue. The
“Fast Overlay” method was used to overlay the two structures.
After the “Fast Overlay” technique, the optimal distance
measurement for the C13, C14, and C18 carbon atoms on both progesterone
and 16-dehydroprogesterone structures was set to 0 Å, and the
structures were manually minimized under the overlay option. This
manual overlay based on atoms C13, C14, and C18 indicates that the
introduction of the double bond between C16 and C17 positions the
C21-carbon atom slightly closer to the original 17-position of progesterone.
The distances between the progesterone 17-hydrogen atom and the C21-carbon
atom of progesterone and of compound 1 are 3.032 and
2.872 Å, respectively. The distances between the progesterone
17-hydrogen atom and the C16-carbon atom of progesterone and of compound 1 are 2.185 and 2.327 Å, respectively.

Although compound 1 is not a typical
steroid in conventional
pathways, rat intestinal anaerobic bacteria possess 16-dehydratase
activity, which catalyzes the formation of compound 1 from the CYP17A1 product 16α-hydroxyprogesterone.31 Compound 1 has been found in human
feces as well.32 The traces of epoxides
formed from enteral steroid metabolites are unlikely to result in
physiologic consequences; however many xenobiotic compounds and steroidal
drugs contain carbon–carbon double or triple bonds and might
be substrates for CYP17A1 or CYP21A2. Mifepristone (RU486), for example,
contains a 17α-propynyl group. In addition to being a progesterone
and cortisol antagonist, mifepristone has been shown to inhibit monkey33 and rat34 17-hydroxylase
activities. The CYP17A1 and CYP21A2 activities described herein might
generate reactive epoxides and/or oxirenes from compounds such as
mifepristone, which could then alkylate the enzymes and cause activity
loss or react with other intracellular molecules, leading to adrenal
toxicities.

Many steroidogenic enzymes of the mammalian adrenal
cortex have
two or more major activities, which are required to yield specific
biologically active hormones. The intrinsic catalytic plasticity and
liberal substrate specificity of these enzymes are not only essential
properties for their physiologic functions but also vulnerabilities,
enabling molecular diseases to arise from even conservative mutations
in these enzymes. In the current study, we employed synthetic organic
chemistry, site-directed mutagenesis, and enzymology studies to reveal
the occult epoxidase chemistry of these steroid hydroxylases. Moreover,
in a different context, CYP17A1, which normally 17-hydroxylates pregnenolone
and both 17- and 16α-position of progesterone, was shown to
have significant 21-hydroxylase activity presented with olefinated
substrate analogues, in which the normal sites of reactivity are blocked.
The immediate information gained from this report is that the steroidogenic
enzymes can oxidize analogues of the natural substrates in a different
fashion from traditionally known activities. Furthermore, using techniques
such as linear free energy relationship (LFER) with broader substrate
sets, we can further enhance our understanding of the active sites
of these important enzymes.
