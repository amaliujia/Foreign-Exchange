Enzymes of
the amidohydrolase
superfamily (AHS) are characterized by a distorted (β/α)8-barrel fold and a shared catalytic reaction mechanism, in
which an activated water or hydroxide attacks an electrophilic center., This family of enzymes has 21762 (59%) functionally unassigned sequences
and a broad substrate profile, encompassing diverse substrates such
as amino acids and organophosphate esters with 42 unique reactions, ranging from hydrolysis, deamination, decarboxylation,
isomerization, hydration to retroaldol cleavage. This broad spectrum of substrates and mechanisms has challenged
automated function assignment by sequence identity. It has been proposed that as many as 40% of enzymes that
are recognized as members of the AHS have been mis-annotated for function
by sequence similarity alone., There are even cases
of mis-annotation when structural information is available., Therefore, it has been suggested that the similarity of computationally
predicted active site pockets is a more accurate method for classifying
enzymes into functional families, while
docking studies can provide substrate candidates.,− However, in the amidohydrolase superfamily, remarkable cases in
which enzymes with 98% sequence identity turn over different substrates,
such as atrazine versus melamine, have occurred, making functional
identification even more difficult.,

An example
of the broad substrate range of the AHS is illustrated
by one of its subclasses, Cog1735 (Figure ), which is one of 24 clusters of orthologous groups (COG) within
the amidohydrolase superfamily. Cog1735 itself may be divided into
nine subclusters (Figure A), each of which
is predicted to be iso-functional, as illustrated by subgroup 3. Three
homologous enzymes in this cluster, from Rhodococcus erythropolis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Mycobacterium
avium subsp. paratuberculosis K-10, have
been tested, and all three have been identified as N-acyl-homoserine lactonaes.− Other functionally annotated
enzymes within Cog1735 have been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis
of phosphotriesters (subgroup 8), and
γ- and δ-lactones (subgroups 9 and 7).,, Recently, we have demonstrated that enzymes
from subgroup 6 of Cog1735, Lmo2620 and BH0225, belong to the phosphotriesterase-like
lactonase superfamily and catalyze the hydrolysis of d-lyxono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate
and l-ribono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate. However, enzymes from subgroups 1, 2, 4, and 5 have no
activity assigned to them, even though representative members have
had their structures determined to atomic resolution [Protein Data
Bank (PDB) entries 1BF6, 3RHG, 3K2G and 3MSR/3OVG, respectively].

as belonging to Cog1735. (A) Each node in the diagram represents a
sequence, and each edge represents the pairwise connection between
two sequences at a BLAST E value of better than 10–80. All functionally annotated proteins (trapezoids)
as well as structurally characterized proteins (triangles) have been
mapped onto the nodes. Ms0025 (cyan and gray triangle) and Mag6390
(cyan and gray circle) are found in subgroup 6. (B) List summarizing
each of the known proteins, structures, substrate profiles, and kinetic
parameters for each node. Colored red are Ms0025 and Mag6390, which
are the phosphorylated sugar lactonases that are able to hydrolyze d-xylono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate. (C) Structure-based sequence
alignment of Ms0025 (gi|71894050, subgroup 6), Lmo2620 (gi|46908819, subgroup 5), phosphotriesterase homology protein (gi|16131257, subgroup 1), and Dr0930 (gi|15805954, group 7). The amino acids
required for metal binding are highlighted in red. The residues implicated
in phosphate binding are highlighted in green and the corresponding
residues in the three other Cog1735 proteins in pink. Regions highlighted
in gray represent the strands of the barrel fold.

Here we investigate the function of two unannotated proteins
of
the amidohydrolase superfamily from subgroup 5 of Cog1735: MAG_6390
from Mycoplasma agalactiae PG2 and MS53_0025 from Mycoplasma synoviae 53 (Table S1 of the ). The three-dimensional structure of
one of these, MS53_0025, was determined to a resolution of 2.06 Å.
Guided by docking screens of metabolite, and focused
carbohydrate libraries, gene context, and structural similarity to
other enzymes, we show that both MS53_0025 and MAG_6390 are lactonases
that hydrolyze both d-xylono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate (2) and l-arabino-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate (7) with kcat/Km values in the range of 104 M–1 s–1. These enzymes are thus a possible system of catabolism
of small 1,4-lactone-5-phosphate sugars (Scheme ), which are a potential energy source for these organisms.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Compounds 1–10 and 12–23 (Scheme )
were synthesized
as previously described.d-Glucono-1,5-lactone-6-phosphate
(compound 11) was synthesized using yeast hexokinase
to phosphorylate d-glucono-1,5-lactone with MgATP. The reaction
was conducted in 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid (MES) buffer (pH 6.0) with 20 mM MgATP and 20 mM d-glucono-1,5-lactone
for up to 3 h at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated with hexokinase
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6 mg/mL) and followed
by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with
a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an H–C–N
cryoprobe. The phosphorylated sugar lactone was stable at pH 6.0 in
50 mM MES buffer for at least 3 h after completion of the reaction.
The pH was increased to 7.0, the reaction mixture passed through a
30 kDa ultrafiltration membrane to remove the hexokinase, and then
activated charcoal added to remove ATP and ADP. All other buffers,
purification reagents, and chemicals used in this work were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated

Cloning, Expression, and
Purification of Ms0025 for Crystallography
The gene for MS53_0025
(denoted Ms0025 hereafter) from M. synoviae (gi|71894050) was codon-optimized for
expression in Escherichia coli, chemically synthesized
(GenScript, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), and cloned into a custom TOPO isomerase
vector, pSGX3(BC), supplied by Life Technologies. The plasmid was
designated NYSGXRC-9686b. The clone encodes Met-Ser-Leu followed by
the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product and finally Glu-Gly-His6. Miniprep DNA was transformed into BL21(DE3)-Codon+RIL expression
cells (Stratagene), expressed, and made into a 30% glycerol stock
for large scale fermentation.

Selenomethionine-labeled protein
was produced for Ms0025 using High Yield SeMet medium (Orion Enterprises,
Inc., Northbrook, IL) supplemented with ZnCl2. Overnight
cultures of expression glycerol stocks were grown in LB medium at
30 °C with kanamycin and chloramphenicol selection. Large scale
cultures (1 L volume in 2 L baffled shake flasks) were inoculated
with 10 mL of saturated overnight cultures per liter. These cultures
were grown for 3 h at 37 °C, and then the temperature was decreased
to 22 °C for postinduction growth for 18 h. Cultures were harvested
using standard centrifugation procedures and frozen prior to purification.

Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20. The cellular
debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 39800g. The supernatant solution was loaded onto an ÄKTAxpress purification
system (GE Healthcare) in which nickel affinity and size exclusion
chromatography were utilized sequentially using a 5 mL HisTrap HP
column and a Superdex S200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare). Nickel binding
buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole,
and 10% glycerol was used to equilibrate the HisTrap column and to
wash the unbound proteins. The nickel elution buffer contained 50
mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol.
The size exclusion chromatography buffer contained 10 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES) (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT). Fractions were pooled on the basis of retention times and sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
results. The protein concentration was 12.7 mg/mL based on the absorbance
at 280 nm. The purity of the protein was &gt;95%, and the protein
identity
was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The expression plasmid
(NYSGXRC clone 9686b2BCt7p1) is available through the PSI Material
Repository (http://psimr.asu.edu/). The DNA sequence and
experimental details are available in the TargetTrack Database (http://sbkb.org/tt/) as Project Target “NYSGXRC-9686b”.

Purification of Ms0025 and Mutants for Activity Screening
The site-directed single mutants of Ms0025 (K29A, E34Q, and H100N)
were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene.
The coding regions of all mutated plasmid DNA were verified by complete
sequencing, and stocks were prepared as previously noted. To express
Ms0025 and variants, BL21(DE3) star cells (Novagen) were transformed
with the plasmid containing the gene. A single freshly transformed
colony was cultured in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL
kanamycin at 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was inoculated
into 1 L of LB medium and cultured at 30 °C while being vigorously
shaken. When the OD600 reached 0.6, the expression of the
target protein was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG). At this point, 1.0 mM Zn(OAc)2 was added, and the
cells were further cultured at room temperature for 18 h and then
harvested by centrifugation. A total of 8 g of frozen cells was resuspended
in 40 mL of binding buffer [20 mM HEPES and 500 mM NaCl (pH 7.9)]
and lysed by sonication at 0 °C. After centrifugation, the nucleic
acids were removed by adding 2% (w/v) protamine sulfate. The supernatant
solution after centrifugation was filtered with a 0.2 μm syringe
filter (VWR) and loaded on a HisTrap HP column preloaded with nickel.
The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of elution buffer [20
mM HEPES, 250 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole (pH 7.9)]. The crude protein
obtained from the HisTrap HP column was concentrated and loaded onto
a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia)
for removal of imidazole and further purification.

Cloning, Expression,
and Purification of Mag6390
The
gene encoding MAG_6390 (denoted Mag6390 hereafter) from M.
agalactiae PG2 was codon optimized, synthesized, and cloned
into pUC57 (GenScript). Expression constructs were generated by PCR
amplification using 5′-TTAAGAAGGAGATATACCATGGCTAAAGACAAGTTCGTCCGCAC-3′
as the forward primer and 5′-GATTGGAAGTAGAGGTTCTCTGCCAGCAGTTTCAGATCCTTCTTCAG-3′
as the reverse primer. PCR was performed using KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerse
(Novagen). The conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C followed
by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 66 °C, and 30 s at
72 °C. The amplified fragment was cloned into the C-terminal
TEV cleavable StrepII-6x-His-tag-containing vector, CHS30, by ligation-independent
cloning.

Expression vectors were
transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) containing
the pRIL plasmid (Stratagene) and used to inoculate 25 mL of PAG medium
with 25 μg/mL kanamycin and 34 μg/mL chloramphenicol.
The culture was allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C in a shaking
incubator. Twenty milliliters of the overnight culture was used to
inoculate 2 L of PASM-5052 autoinduction medium (Studier) containing
150 mM 2,2-bipyridyl, 1.0 mM ZnCl2, and 1.0 mM MnCl2. The culture was placed in a LEX48 airlift fermenter and
incubated at 37 or 22 °C overnight. The culture was harvested
and pelleted by centrifugation.

Cells were suspended in lysis
buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH
7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol and lysed by
sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 35000g for 30 min. Proteins were purified on an ÄKTAxpress
FPLC system (GE Healthcare). Clarified lysates were loaded onto a
1 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), washed with 10 column volumes
of lysis buffer, and eluted with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl,
500 mM imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The purified sample was loaded
onto a HiLoad S200 16/60 HR gel filtration column, which was equilibrated
in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM DTT.
Peak fractions were collected, and protein was analyzed by SDS–PAGE.
Samples were concentrated to 7.5 mg/mL using Amicon Ultra centrifugal
filters (Millipore), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
−80 °C.

Metal Analysis
The protein concentrations
were determined
spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette
with a SPECTRAmax-340 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The extinction
coefficient at 280 nm was calculated to be 26610 M–1 cm–1 for Ms0025 and 31080 M–1 cm–1 for Mag6390 (http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). The metal content of the purified protein was determined using
inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Before
ICP-MS measurements, the protein samples were treated with concentrated
nitric acid for 20 min at 100 °C and then diluted with distilled
H2O until the final concentration of nitric acid was 1%.
The average metal contents of Ms0025 and Mag6390 were 1.6 and 1.5
Zn2+ ions per subunit, respectively.

Determination
of the Structure of Ms0025
The purified
protein was concentrated to ∼10 mg/mL and subjected to sitting-drop
vapor diffusion in a 96-well plate by mixing 1 μL of the protein
solution and 1 μL of the reservoir solution from the Index and
Crystal screen of Hampton Research. The apoprotein with phosphate
in the active site formed cubic-shaped crystals overnight from 0.2
M potassium sodium tartrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 2.0
M ammonium sulfate. Ms0025 was also crystallized in 2.4 M sodium malonate
(pH 7.0). This protein contained two zincs and one phosphate in the
active site. Crystals were cryoprotected by adding 20% (v/v) glycerol
to the mother liquor and flash-frozen by being directly immersed in
liquid nitrogen for data collection.

X-ray diffraction data
were collected at the selenium absorption edge (λ = 0.9795 Å)
at beamlines X12C and X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source
(NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were processed with
HKL2000 or MOSFLM/SCALA.− Ms0025 (PDB entry 3MSR) crystallized in
hexagonal space group P6322 with one molecule
per asymmetric unit and diffracted to at least 2.16 Å resolution.
The structure was determined by AUTOSOL, followed by autobuilding in ARP/wARP. The second structure of Ms0025 (PDB entry 3OVG) was determined
by molecular replacement using PHASER with the native (PDB entry 3MSR) structure as the
search model. This protein crystallized
in the triclinic space group with six molecules in the asymmetric
unit and diffracted to 2.06 Å resolution. Atomic models for both
structures were subsequently manually adjusted using COOT. Both structures were refined to convergence
with PHENIX. Data collection and refinement
statistics are summarized in Table .

Kinetic Measurements and
Data Analysis
The reaction
rates were measured with a SPECTRAmax-340 plate reader. The hydrolysis
of lactones was monitored using a pH-sensitive colorimetric assay.
The net production of protons was measured using the pH indicator
cresol purple. The reactions were conducted
in 2.5 mM Bicine buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.2 M NaCl and the compound
(0.01–2 mM) to be tested as a potential substrate. The cresol
purple concentration was 0.1 mM in 1% Dimethyl sulfide (DMSO), and
the change in absorbance monitored at 577 nm. The effective extinction
coefficient (ΔOD per mole of H+) was obtained from
the titration with acetic acid at 577 nm and found to be 1.76 ×
103 M–1 cm–1. The protein
was stored in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and then exchanged with 10 mM Bicine
buffer (pH 8.3) using a PD-10 desalting column. A background rate
was observed in the absence of substrate because of the acidification
by atmospheric CO2 and was subtracted (5–10 mOD/min)
from the initial rates of the enzymatic reactions. The hydrolysis
of compound 23 was monitored by 13C NMR using
a Bruker Avance III 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with an H–C–N
cryoprobe at pH 7.0 using a Ms0025 concentration of 3 mg/mL. No hydrolysis
product was detected after incubation with enzyme for 1 h at pH 7.0.

Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rates directly
to eq where ν is the initial
velocity, Et is the enzyme concentration, kcat is the turnover number, [A] is the substrate
concentration, and Km is the Michaelis
constant.

Docking Screens
The Ms0025 protein structure (PDB entry 3MSR) was prepared for
initial docking using previously described protocols.,,,, To optimize the system, the charges on the
two Zn2+ ions were reduced to +1.3 for Znα and +1.4 for Znβ, while the charges of the coordinating
Nε atoms of His24, His26, and His214 and Nδ of His186
were increased by 0.25 each. To balance the system, the net charge
on Asp272 was increased by 0.1 and that on the carbamylated Lys153
was increased by 0.2, as has been previously employed in docking to
amidohydrolases., After the second structure of
Ms0025 (PDB entry 3OVG) had been determined, chain B was used for docking. It was the chain
with the lowest average B factor per atom (19.3 Å2), and it had well-defined density around the Znα and Znβ atoms and the catalytically important water
(H2O-1198). The active site for docking was based on the
positions of water molecules and the distal phosphate molecule.

Two libraries were used for virtual screening. First, a specially
constructed high-energy intermediate (HEI) library that was based
on the 5/6-membered phosphorylated sugar lactones or acid sugar lactones
(Scheme S1 of the ). This library contained 12 furanose- and pyranose-based scaffolds
that expanded to 216 unique enantiomers. These molecules were used
to create high-energy state compounds in which the catalytically active
center has formed a bond with the hydroxide. Compounds in this library
were automatically generated and can undergo either a hydrolysis or
dephosphorylation reaction with different protonation profiles, creating
1728 or 112 HEI molecules, respectively. Each of these molecules was
represented by up to 10 different conformations, generating a final
library of 4316 high-energy state compounds for docking, termed the
SUG-HEI library. The second library is our standard in-house library
consisting of 57672 high-energy intermediate KEGG molecules (HEI-KEGG)
that is based on unique metabolites from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes database of compounds (KEGG),, which contain a reactive center annotated for the AHS mechanism.,

Molecular docking was performed using DOCK3.6 as with previous docking campaigns, using receptor and ligand bin sizes of 0.4 Å, an overlap of
0.1–0.2 Å, a bump allowance of 3, and a distance tolerance
of 1.5 Å with label matching turned off. Finally, each molecule
was subjected to 250 cycles of rigid-body minimization (we note that
the high bump allowance is ultimately resolved by rigid-body minimization).
The top 500 scoring molecules with a maximal distance of 4 Å
between the reactive center of the HEI molecule and the zinc metal
center were inspected visually.

Results
Determination
of the Structure of Ms0025
The three-dimensional
structure of the apo form of Ms0025 (PDB entry 3MSR) and its structure
in complex with the binuclear metal center (PDB entry 3OVG) were determined
at resolutions of 2.16 and 2.06 Å, respectively. Both structures
have one phosphate ion bound at a distal part of the active site.
The zinc-bound structure has two metal ions bound in the active site
in all protomers. The six molecules in the asymmetric unit agree with
a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) in the range of 0.12–0.21
Å for all Cα pairs. The overall structures of the apo and
zinc-bound proteins are nearly identical with an rmsd of 0.21 Å.
The Ms0025 structure has an (β/α)8-barrel fold
with antiparallel β-strands formed at the C-terminal end of
the protein (Figure ). There are additional
antiparallel β-strands inserted between (αβ)3 and (αβ)4. The binding sites for the
two zinc ions and the phosphate molecule are located at the C-terminal
end of the (β/α)8-barrel.

Ribbon representation
of the three-dimensional structure of the
(β/α)8-barrel fold of a single chain of Ms0025
(PDB entry 3MSR/3OVG). The
two Zn2+ metals are colored gray, and the phosphate ligand
is colored orange. The central β-barrel is colored purple, and
the helices are colored cyan.

The distance between the two zinc ions is 3.6 Å. Lys153
is
carboxylated (Kcx153) and coordinates with both zinc ions. The β-zinc
has a tetrahedral geometry with Kcx153, His186, His214, and a water
molecule, while the α-zinc is coordinated by His24, His26, Kcx153,
Asp272, and two water molecules (Figure  and
Table ). A similar zinc coordination geometry
is found in urease, phosphotriesterase, and other (β/α)8-barrel metalloproteins from the amidohydrolase superfamily., In both of the structures reported here, a phosphate molecule is
bound at the C-terminal opening of the (β/α)8-barrel. The distances between the phosphorus and the two zinc ions
are 8.7 and 8.8 Å. The phosphate is hydrogen bonded to Tyr245,
Arg275, Lys244, Tyr278, Lys217, and two water molecules (Figure ), and these residues are conserved in both Ms0025
and Mag6390 enzymes, and the Lmo2620 enzyme (PDB entry 3PNZ), and could indicate
a conserved residue cluster for phosphate binding (Figure S2 of the ).

site residues (white sticks) are indicated with dashed lines. The
α-zinc is coordinated by His24, His26, Kcx153, Asp272, and two
water molecules, while the β-zinc exhibits tetrahedral geometry
and is coordinated by Kcx153, His186, His214, and the bridging water
molecule.

Substrate Specificity and Kinetic Measurements
We began
by interrogating the catalytic profile of Ms0025 and Mag6390, which
share a sequence identity of 80% (Table S1 of the ), by physically screening a focused
library of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated lactones. The following
is a list of candidate substrates that were chosen on the basis of
previously observed activities for amidohydrolases in Cog1735 (Figure B), all of which were found to be inactive against
Ms0025. For phosphotriesterase and phosphodiesterase activity: diethyl
4-nitrophenyl phosphate, ethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, bis(4-nitrophenyl)
phosphate, and 4-nitrophenyl phosphate. For quorum sensing activity:
(S)-α-amino-γ-butyrolactone, (R)-α-amino-γ-butyrolactone, and N-butyryl-dl-homoserine lactone. For lactonase activity:
β-propiolactone, β-butyrolactone, γ-butyrolactone,
α-methyl-γ-butyrolactone, (±)-γ-valerolactone,
(R)-γ-valerolactone, γ-caprolactone,
γ-heptalactone, γ-nonanoic lactone, (S)-4-nonanolide, dl-α-hydroxy-β,β-dimethyl-γ-butyrolactone, d-gulonic acid γ-lactone, d-(+)-glucuronic acid
γ-lactone, l-gulonic acid γ-lactone, δ-valerolactone,
5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one, 2H-pyran-2-one,
δ-hexalactone, δ-nonalactone, (±)-5-decanolide, d-(+)-gluconic acid δ-lactone, and ε-caprolactone
(Figure S1 of the ). Unexpectedly, Ms0025 is not an archetypal AHS phosphotriesterase
or lactonase, as it is unable to hydrolyze simple 1,4- or 1,5-lactones,
nor was it able to hydrolyze N-acyl homoserine lactones.
This prompted us to seek other clues about enzyme activity.

The Gene
Context of Ms0025 Links It to Sugar Pathway Enzymes
The Ms0025
gene is located immediately upstream of a sugar phosphotransferase
system (PTS), which is annotated as an ascorbate-specific transporter.
All three genes, ulaABC, which comprise a system
used to phosphorylate and translocate ascorbate across the cytoplasmic
membrane, are adjacent to Ms0025 (Figure ). All but one gene associated with the ascorbate
PTS from E. coli K12 st., MG1655, is conserved in M. synoviae 53, including the genes ulaR, ulaD, ulaE, and ulaF() (Figure ).
This part of the PTS system is used to convert the 3-keto-l-gulonate-6-phosphate to d-xylulose-5-phosphate for use
as a carbon source in the E. coli K12 pentose phosphate
pathway. The only substitution in this
cluster is ulaG, which hydrolyzes intracellular ascorbate-6-phosphate
(10) to 3-keto-l-gulonate-6-phosphate., The UlaG enzyme is replaced in M. synoviae 53 by
Ms0025. This led us to believe that we were looking for a phosphorylated
substrate for Ms0025. Accordingly, ascorbate-6-phosphate (10) was assayed as a substrate of Ms0025 but demonstrated no turnover.
Interestingly, even though the overall folds of UlaG and Ms0025 differ,
both have a binuclear metal cluster and exhibit the same 3-fold symmetry
(Figure ). Because UlaG hydrolyzes a furanose
ring of a phosphorylated 1,4-lactone, this observation nucleated our
interest in a computational docking screen of metabolites and helped
us to interpret the results.

(Ms0025) and Lys260 (UlaG) is shown, which appears to be in a favorable
position for substrate interaction, albeit coming from a different
direction.

Docking to the Ms0025 Structure
We screened molecules
from the KEGG library that can undergo the known amidohydrolase reactions
in high-energy intermediate geometries against the apo structure,
which allows for flexibility of the binding site and poses an additional
challenge in identifying the natural substrate. In this screen, furanose sugar lactone compounds were highly
ranked in catalytically competent geometries. Among these, d-galactono-1,4-lactone ranked 270 of 57672 molecules screened and
was identified as a possible substrate given the gene context considerations
(Figure A). Encouragingly, in the docked pose
of this lactone, all the donor and acceptor groups interact with active
site residues. The hydroxyls at positions 2 and 3 on the lactone ring
interact with Lys29 and Glu34. The hydroxyl at position 5 forms a
hydrogen bond with Lys217. In addition, the orientation of the lactone
allows enough space for the superposition of the crystallographic
phosphate that is coordinated by Lys244, Tyr245, Tyr278, and Arg275.
The gap between the distal oxygen at position 6 of the lactone and
the phosphate in this structural superposition is 1.5 Å, which
is the length of a covalent bond, suggesting that a phosphorylated d-galactono-1,4-lactone could fit into the active site comfortably
(Figure A).

initial hits from the KEGG HEI library. These are superposed with

known substrates that are hydrolyzed by Ms0025 and Mag6390. (E) d-Glucono-1,4-lactone-6-phosphate (green sticks)

For all panels, polar contacts are shown as dashed lines, white sticks
represent the metal-chelating residues, dark gray sticks represent
residues that were mutated, and green sticks represent residues that
interact with the phosphate in the crystal structure.

A subsequent docking screen was undertaken with
12 different phosphorylated
and carboxylated furanose and pyranose compounds (Scheme S1 of the ). Once each chiral center
had been enumerated, 216 unique molecules were generated, which led
to the creation of a library of 4316 focused SUG-HEI compounds. This
library was docked, and even though we started with only two phosphorylated
five-membered sugar lactones (24 ground state isomers), they populated
28% of the top 100 docking list of candidate substrates for Ms0025.
Furthermore, furanose sugars (Figure C,E and
Table S2 of the )
were preferentially docked over pyranose sugars. Indeed, 95 of the
top 100 scoring molecules contained a furanose; additionally, phosphorylated
pyranose sugars were observed only 13 times in the top 500 list. Candidate
substrates with a two-carbon linker between the furanose and the phosphate
were accommodated well in the active site. This longer linker was
able to place the phosphate groups within hydrogen bonding distance
of all residues that line the distal pocket at the rim of the active
site: Arg275, Tyr278, Lys277, and Tyr245. An example of a well-posed
larger phosphorylated furanose compound is d-glucono-1,4-lactone-6-phosphate
(Figure E), which could in theory be hydrolyzed
to produce 6-phospho-d-gluconate. However, these molecules
could not be synthesized for enzymatic analysis. Defining the preferred
stereochemistry at positions 2 and 3 of the furanose ring was more
difficult. Many stereoisomers had broadly similar ranks, with the
possible exception of the C4 position with the R conformation,
which was preferred in 85% of the furanose molecules ranked in the
top 100 molecules of the SUG-HEI library.

Kinetic Measurements of
Sugar Lactones
On the basis
of the docking screens, the positioning of the crystallographic phosphate
in the active site of Ms0025, and the structural similarity to Lmo2620,
we inferred that Ms0025 and Mag6390 may recognize phosphorylated or
carboxylated sugar lactones. Therefore,
the eight stereoisomers of 1,4-pentolactone-5-phosphate (1–8) were synthesized and assayed for activity. Of these, d-xylono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate (2) and l-arabino-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate
(7) were confirmed as substrates, with kcat/Km values of 4.7 ×
104 and 5.7 × 104 M–1 s–1 to kcat/Km values of 1.3 × 104 and 2.2
× 104 M–1 s–1 for
Ms0025 and Mag6390, respectively (Table ).
These two compounds have the same stereochemical configuration at
C2 and C3 but the opposite stereochemistry at C4. No activity could
be detected with 2-deoxy-d-ribonolactone-5-phosphate (9), l-ascorbate-lactone-6-phosphate (10), or d-glucono-1,5-lactone-6-phosphate (11). The two enzymes were also screened with a series of lactones made
from diacid sugars (compounds 12–19 and 20–23). Hydrolytic activity was found with compounds 12 (racemic mixture with 16), 20 (racemic mixture with 21), and 22 (Table  and Table S2 of the ). In the docked poses, the furanose rings of the
substrates were positioned similarly, with the reactive lactone bond
positioned directly above the divalent metal center within hydrogen
bonding distance of Asp227. This allows nucleophilic attack of the
hydroxide from the si face of the lactone ring. To
allow for the differing stereochemistry at C4, in the docking poses
the furanose ring puckers in the opposite directions and twists slightly
while maintaining the same contacts between the hydroxyls at C2 and
C3 and the active site residues Glu34 and Lys29 (Figure C,D).

Hydrolysis
of the Racemic Mixture of Compounds 20 and 21
Stereospecific hydrolysis of phosphorylated
1,4-lactones (2 and 7) versus any other
enantiomer (1, 3–6, and 8) suggests that Ms0025 and Mag6390 have a strict requirement for
the orientation of the hydroxyl groups at C2 and C3 of the sugar ring.
For the corresponding diacid sugar lactones (12–21), it was not possible to physically separate the racemic pairs of
compounds. To demonstrate that a single isomer was hydrolyzed in the
racemic mixture of 20 and 21, 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor the rate of hydrolysis until
it reached completion. In this reaction, 0.2 μM Ms0025 was mixed
with compounds 20 and 21 (5.0 mM each) in
20 mM Pipes buffer (pH 6.1). The 1H NMR spectrum of the
reaction was monitored and recorded every 10 min. The formation of
the hydrolyzed product was monitored at 3.8 ppm, and the disappearance
of the substrate was monitored at 4.1 ppm (Figure ). Only one of the two isomeric compounds was hydrolyzed,
showing a preference of C2 (R) and C3 (R).

1H NMR spectral results indicating as a percentage the
formation of the hydrolyzed product and the disappearance of the substrate,
demonstrating a single isomer hydrolysis in the mixture of compounds 20 and 21.

Mutational Analysis
Amino acids that were not conserved
between Ms0025/Mag6390 and Lmo2620 and demonstrated interactions with
the docked compounds were mutated (K29A, E34Q, and H100N), with possibly
the greatest impact being attributed to the K29A mutation (Figure
S2 of the ). Interestingly,
these mutations did not change the substrate profile of the Ms0025
protein, though the catalytic rates were reduced (Table ). The change in the catalytic efficiency can be mostly attributed
to the decrease in the turnover rate, possibly indicating that these
residues are required for the correct orientation of the substrate,
for stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate, or for the protonation
of the hydrolyzed lactones and therefore do not change the substrate
specificity.

Discussion
Ms0025 and Mag6390 are characteristic enzymes
of subgroup 5 of
Cog1735 of the amidohydrolase superfamily, for which no activity was
previously known (Figure  and Table S1 of
the ), which we propose
to classify as phospho-furanose lactonases. In retrospect, this may
seem unsurprising, as among the characterized enzymes closest in sequence
and structure to Ms0025 and Mag6390 is Lmo2620 [31% identical (Figure C and Figure S2 of the )], which hydrolyzes d-lyxono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate
(1) and l-ribono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate (8), which closely resemble substrates d-xylono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate
(2) and l-arabino-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate (7), respectively (Table ). However,
neither Ms0025 nor Mag6390 can hydrolyze the substrates of Lmo2620,
nor are these proteins active on phosphotriesters or simple lactones
characteristic of other subclasses of Cog1735 or against a broader
screen for lactone substrates, including β-lactones, γ-lactone,
δ-lactone, ε-lactones, and cyclic monosaccharides (furanose
and pyranose) (Figure S3 of the ). Indeed, the fidelity to substrate stereochemistry is tight for
these enzymes, whose substrates and nonsubstrates are separated only
by the stereochemistry around one of the lactone ring hydroxyl groups.
It was only when we turned to an integrated analysis of gene context,
docking screens of candidate metabolites, and enzyme structure that
the true substrates of these enzymes began to emerge (Figure C,D and Table S2 of the ).

The genetic context of the two enzymes
suggested a role in an ascorbic
acid pathway, recognizing sugar phosphates. Whereas this was misleading
in itself—the actual metabolites in this pathway tested were
inactive as substrates—it did support recognition of the overall
chemotype. Docking of the KEGG and then a specialized lactone library
confirmed the recognition of lactones, especially pentalactones, by
the enzyme. Here too, these precise molecules are not, in fact, substrates.
However, juxtaposition of highly ranked docked molecules such as d-galactono-1,4-lactone (KEGG entry C03383, dock rank 270/371
of 57672 molecules docked, Figure A), d-fucono-1,4-lactone (KEGG entry C06158, dock rank 409/431), l-arabino-1,4-lactone (KEGG entry C01114, dock rank 408/414),
and d-glucurono-6,2-lactone (KEGG entry C03387, rank 357,
Figure B) upon the X-ray structure, with its
active site phosphate, and superposition on Lmo2620 suggested 1,4-lactone-5-phosphates
as candidate substrates. This provided the impetus for their synthesis
and subsequent determination that they were good substrates for both
Ms0025 and Mag6390. Thus, it was an integration of genetic context,
library docking, structural information, and kinetic analysis—no
one of which was in itself sufficient—that led to the deorphanization
and functional characterization of these two enzymes. Whether such
information can be systematically integrated in future function–prediction
efforts is uncertain at this time; what is clear is that there will
be cases in which it is needed, as certainly was the case here.

Conclusion
Ms0025 and Mag6390 are lactonases that linearize
phosphorylated 1,4-lactones and, to a lesser extent, carboxy 1,4-lactones
(Table  and Table S2 of the ). The molecular function assigned to
these enzymes is the hydrolysis of d-xylono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate
(2), with kcat/Km values of 4.7 × 104 and 5.7 × 104 M–1 s–1 and l-arabino-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate (7) with kcat/Km values of 1.3 ×
104 and 2.2 × 104 M–1 s–1, for Ms0025 and Mag6390, respectively. The
enzyme is able to hydrolyze diacid sugar lactones (12, 20, and 22) with the same stereochemistry
as the phosphorylated compounds, however, with decreased catalytic
turnover rates. This brings us closer to identifying the primary functions
of the enzymes from Cog1735, in that now only subgroups 1, 2, and
4 have three-dimensional structures assigned to them yet are functionally
uncharacterized. Unlike previous cases in which we have discovered
activities for unannotated amidohydrolases, with Ms0025 and Mag6390,
neither empirical screening,,, sequence comparisons,,, nor structural and computational screening techniques alone,,,− sufficed in identifying the true substrates. It was only the combination of these three approaches,
leading to the synthesis of entirely new substrates, not present in
the docking or empirical screening libraries, that ultimately illuminated
the activities of these enzymes. A future challenge will be to develop
methods that integrate these approaches systematically and programmatically,
as other cases like these undoubtedly await.
