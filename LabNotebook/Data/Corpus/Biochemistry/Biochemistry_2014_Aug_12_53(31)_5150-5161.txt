The proline catabolic pathway
catalyzes the oxidation of proline to
glutamate (Scheme ). In the first step, proline
dehydrogenase (PRODH) uses an FAD cofactor to remove two electrons
(as H–) from proline, resulting in Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
(P5C). P5C then undergoes a nonenzymatic hydrolysis, which opens the
pyrroline ring to create glutamate-γ-semialdehyde
(GSA). Finally, GSA is oxidized to glutamate by the NAD+-dependent P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) to complete the overall four-electron
oxidation process. Proline and proline metabolism are important for
the pathogenicity of Helicobacter pylori and Helicobacter hepaticus,, energy production
in procyclic trypanosomes,, and regulation of metabolites
linked to pathogenesis in Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus. In
humans, inborn errors in proline catabolism lead to hyperprolinemia
disorders, and defects in PRODH are linked to schizophrenia., Also, PRODH is regulated by p53 and has been shown to function in
tumor suppression.

Overall Reaction
Catalyzed by Proline Utilization A (PutA)
Flavin-dependent proline dehydrogenase
(PRODH) catalyzes the oxidation of proline to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate
(P5C) and reduction of respiratory quinones in the membrane (Mem).
P5C undergoes a nonenzymatic hydrolysis, resulting in glutamate-γ-semialdehyde
(GSA). GSA is oxidized to glutamate by P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH) using
an NAD+ cofactor.

PRODH and P5CDH
are combined into a single polypeptide chain known
as proline utilization A (PutA) in Gram-negative bacteria and Corynebacterium. The covalent
linking of enzymes catalyzing consecutive reactions in a metabolic
pathway affords the possibility of substrate channeling; i.e., the
intermediate is transferred between the enzymes without equilibrating
with the bulk medium. Several physiological benefits of substrate
channeling versus free diffusion have been identified. For example,
channeling improves kinetic efficiency by decreasing the transit time
between active sites and preventing the loss of intermediates., Thus, channeling enzymes can operate at maximal rates when cellular
substrate concentrations are below saturating levels. Also, labile intermediates can be concealed from the bulk
environment, preventing decay or interaction with other molecules., Finally, channeling can influence metabolic flux by segregating
intermediates from competing pathways.

Substrate channeling of P5C/GSA in proline catabolism may
be necessary
to retain proper metabolic flux and avoid metabolic futile cycling. In addition, free P5C/GSA is an inhibitor of
three different enzymes in Escherichia coli, including
glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase, cytidine-5′-triphosphate
synthase, and the amidotransferase domain of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase.− P5C has also been shown to form
adducts with other metabolites such as oxaloacetic acid, pyruvic acid,
and acetoacetic acid. Consistent with
the physiological importance of controlling the release of P5C/GSA,
kinetic studies have firmly established substrate channeling in PutAs.
Early studies of Salmonella typhimurium PutA using 14C-labeled proline are consistent with a channeling mechanism. More recent steady-state and rapid reaction
transient time measurements of PutAs from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (BjPutA) and Geobacter sulfurreducens (GsPutA)
also indicate substrate channeling., Furthermore,
a comprehensive analysis of the complete kinetic mechanism of E. coli PutA showed that substrate channeling is rate-limiting,
and the rate constant for the channeling step is slowest during the
first enzyme turnover and increases with subsequent turnovers, establishing
PutA as a new example of a hysteretic enzyme.

With the kinetic data firmly demonstrating substrate channeling
in PutA, the goal of this study is to gain insight into the structural
basis of channeling. The crystal structures of BjPutA and GsPutA revealed
that the two active sites are separated by a linear distance of 41–45
Å, implying that substrate channeling involves substantial
movement of the P5C/GSA intermediate., Analysis of
potential channeling pathways predicts a curved, 75 Å tunnel
that connects the two active sites (Figure ).

(B) Details of the predicted channeling pathway. The predicted path

shown for scale (green). (C) Another view of the tunnel/cavity system,
with the predicted channeling tunnel calculated from MOLE shown as
gray mesh and the off-pathway cavity calculated using VOIDOO shown
as red mesh.

Here we use site-directed
mutagenesis, kinetics, and X-ray crystallography
to gain further insight into the structural features that facilitate
substrate channeling in BjPutA. Several residues between the two active
sites have been mutated in an effort to obstruct molecular traffic.
Kinetic and structural analysis of the mutant enzymes shows that channeling
is hindered in some of the variants but not others, which provides
information about the pathway traversed by the intermediate. Furthermore,
steric considerations suggest that GSA is threaded through the tunnel
in a linear conformation, with the aldehyde group facing the P5CDH
end of the tunnel. This aspect of substrate channeling in PutA might
be considered an example of shape selective catalysis.

Expression and Purification
of BjPutA Proteins
BjPutA
wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed as reported previously,
except that induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
was performed at 20 °C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at −80
°C. Frozen cells were resuspended in 50 mL of binding buffer
[20 mM Tris base, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM imidazole,
and 10% glycerol (pH 7.9)] and 100 μM flavin at 4 °C. Protease
inhibitors ε-amino-N-caproic acid
(3 mM), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.3 mM), leupeptin (1.2 μM),
tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (48 μM), and tosyllysine
chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride (78 μM) were added, and cells
were disrupted via sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged for
1 h at 19000 rpm in a JA-20 rotor (Beckman) and filtered through a
0.2 μm filter (VWR). Cell-free lysate was loaded onto a Ni-NTA
Superflow resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with binding buffer. Wash buffer
(60 mM imidazole) and then elution buffer (500 mM imidazole) were
applied to the column. Elution fractions containing PutA protein were
pooled and dialyzed into buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10
mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol and loaded onto an anion exchange
column (HiTrap Q HP column, GE Life Sciences) equilibrated with dialysis
buffer. BjPutA proteins were eluted using a linear 0 to 1 M NaCl gradient
(1 L) in dialysis buffer. Purified enzyme was then
dialyzed into a final buffer of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5
mM EDTA, 0.5 mM tris(3-hydroxypropyl)phosphine, and 10% glycerol.
The His tag was retained in the subsequent kinetic experiments.
The amount of flavin bound in the purified proteins was quantified
as described previously (ε451 = 13.62 mM–1 cm–1 for bound flavin). The protein
concentration was determined from the amount of bound flavin to normalize
for differences in flavin content, and the protein was flash-frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.

Steady-State
Kinetic Assays
Steady-state kinetic assays
were performed at 23 °C. Kinetic parameters for the PRODH domain
were determined for proline and ubiquinone-1 (CoQ1) by
following reduction of CoQ1 at 278 nm (ε278 = 14.5 mM–1 cm–1) (Table ). All assays were
performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.5) with 0.5 μM PutA enzyme. The Km and kcat values for proline were determined
by varying the proline concentration (1–200 mM) while holding
the CoQ1 concentration constant (250
μM), and CoQ1 kinetic parameters were determined
by varying the CoQ1 concentration (10–350 μM)
while holding the proline concentration fixed at 150 mM.
Data were collected on a Hi-Tech Scientific SF-61DX2 stopped-flow
instrument using a 0.15 cm path length. Initial velocities were fit
to the Michaelis–Menten equation using SigmaPlot 12.0.

Kinetic
parameters of P5CDH activity were
determined for P5C/GSA (Table ) using exogenous
(DL)-P5C and 0.25 μM PutA enzyme. (DL)-P5C was neutralized with
10 M NaOH immediately prior to assays. The concentration of L-P5C
is considered to be half the total (DL)-P5C concentration. To maintain
a constant ionic strength, we performed all assays with exogenous
(DL)-P5C in 600 mM NaCl as described previously.Km and kcat for P5C/GSA were determined by varying the L-P5C concentration
(0.01–6
mM) while holding the NAD+ concentration constant at
0.2 mM in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5, 600 mM NaCl). The effective
concentration of GSA was estimated from the pH dependence of the P5C-GSA
equilibrium reported previously. Initial
velocities were determined by following NAD+ reduction
at 340 nm (ε340 = 6200 M–1 cm–1). All assays were performed using a Powerwave XS
96-well plate
reader (Biotek).

Mixture of 0.01–6
mM L-P5C,
0.2 mM NAD+, 0.25 μM enzyme, and 50 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.5, 600 mM NaCl).

From fluorescence quenching with
0.1–25 μM NAD+, 0.25 μM enzyme, and
50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5).

The P5CDH activity of wild-type BjPutA
and its D779A, D779Y, and D779W mutants using smaller aldehyde substrates
relative to GSA was tested. All assays were performed in 50 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl) containing 0.2 mM NAD+ and
variable concentrations of succinate semialdehyde (0.05–20
mM) and propionaldehyde (5–500 mM). For assays with succinate
semialdehyde, the concentrations
of wild-type BjPutA and mutant D779A were 0.25 μM while those
of mutants D779W and D779Y were 1 μM. For propionaldehyde, the
concentrations of wild-type BjPutA and mutant D779A were 0.25 μM,
that of D779W was 1 μM, and that of D779W was 2 μM. Initial
velocities were determined by following NAD+ reduction
at 340 nm. All assays were performed using a Powerwave XS 96-well
plate reader (Biotek).

The coupled PRODH–P5CDH activity
of wild-type BjPutA and
its mutants was monitored by following NADH formation at 340 nm or
by fluorescence excitation at 340 nm and monitoring fluorescence emission
at 460 nm using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Assays
were performed at 23 °C in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) containing 0.1 mM CoQ1, 0.2 mM NAD+, 40 mM proline, and the BjPutA enzyme
as previously described. To determine
the kinetic parameters of the overall
PRODH–P5CDH reaction for wild-type BjPutA and the D778Y mutant,
we performed assays by varying the proline concentration (0.1–550
mM) and holding the CoQ1 (0.1 mM) and NAD+ (0.2
mM) concentrations fixed in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl). NADH formation was followed at 340 nm. Data
were fit to a substrate inhibition equation (eq ) using SigmaPlot 12.0, where [S] is the substrate concentration
and Ki is the substrate inhibition constant.

Binding
of NAD+ to BjPutA
The binding of
NAD+ to BjPutA was assessed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence
quenching of BjPutA as described previously. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm, and fluorescence
emission was recorded at 330 nm. Increasing concentrations of NAD+ (0–20 μM) were added to BjPutA (0.25 μM)
in 50 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.5). The inner filter effect caused by the absorption
of incident light by NAD+ at 295 nm was corrected using
eq .where Fcorr and Fobs are
the corrected and observed fluorescence,
respectively, and Aex and Aem are the absorbance values of NAD+ at the
excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. A dissociation
constant (Kd) for the BjPutA–NAD+ complex was determined by plotting the fraction of BjPutA
bound by NAD+ (θ) versus the free NAD+ concentration using eq , where n is the number of binding sites.The concentration of free NAD+ was
determined using eq .The value of θ is obtained from the fluorescence
measurements
[(F0 – F)/(F0 – Fmax)],
where F0 is the fluorescence intensity
without NAD+, F is the fluorescence intensity
in the presence of NAD+, and Fmax is the maximal fluorescence intensity at saturating NAD+ concentrations.

Binding of NAD to wild-type BjPutA was also
estimated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Titrations were
performed at 4 °C using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. Wild-type
BjPutA was dialyzed
into a buffer composed of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM
EDTA, and 10% glycerol. A NAD+ stock solution of 0.5 mM
was made in dialysis buffer. For each titration, 23.4 μM BjPutA
was titrated with 2 μL injections (40 total) of 0.5 mM NAD+ at 160 s intervals while the mixture was being stirred at
310 rpm. Data were analyzed using a one-site binding model with Origin
ITC
Analysis software provided with the instrument.

Prior to the
assays described above being performed, the amount
of NAD+ bound to purified BjPutA was estimated by high-performance
liquid chromatography. BjPutA was denatured with 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic
acid and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min to release bound FAD and
NAD+ cofactors. Samples were then filtered with a 0.45
μm
filter before being loaded onto the column. FAD and NAD+ were separated on a C18 column using 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH
5.3) and 100% methanol. The cofactors were eluted using a flow rate
of 1 mL/min with 5 min of isocratic phosphate buffer, followed by
a 25 min linear
gradient to 50% methanol, and finally a 5 min linear gradient to 75%
methanol. Both cofactors were detected at 280 nm. NAD+ and
FAD eluted from the column at 7.9 and 16.6 min, respectively. The
concentration of NAD+ was determined using standard solutions
of NAD+ (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 μM). From this
analysis, it was estimated that 74% of purified BjPutA
contained bound NAD+. Thus, the NAD+ binding
experiments report on the remaining 26% of BjPutA that was purified
without NAD+ bound.

Single-Turnover Kinetic
Experiments
Single-turnover
experiments were performed at 21 °C under anaerobic conditions
as described previously. Briefly, equal
volumes of BjPutA enzyme (21.3 μM wild type and 17.9 μM
D779Y) were preincubated with 0.1 mM NAD+ in 50 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.5,
25 mM NaCl) and rapidly mixed with 40 mM proline in 50 mM potassium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl) (all concentrations reported
as final concentrations after mixing). Anaerobic conditions were achieved by degassing buffer, substrate,
and enzyme solutions by performing repeated vacuum/nitrogen cycles
followed by addition of protocatechuate dioxgenase (PCD) (0.05 unit/mL)
and protocatechuic acid (PCA) (100 μM), which scrub dissolved
oxygen. All enzyme manipulations were performed
in an anaerobic glovebox (Belle Technology) prior to the experiments.
Rapid-reaction experiments were performed with a Hi-Tech Scientific
SF-61DX2 stopped-flow instrument equipped with a photodiode array
detector. The stopped-flow mixing cell and tubing were thoroughly
washed and incubated overnight with PCA/PCD buffer before stopped-flow
syringes were loaded with anaerobic substrate and enzyme solutions.
Multiwavelength data (300–700 nm) were recorded, and single-wavelength
traces of FAD (451 nm)
and NAD+ (340 nm) were extracted and fit to a single-exponential
equation to estimate observed rate constants for FAD and NAD+ reduction as previously reported.

Determination of Crystal Structures and Structural Analysis
Wild-type BjPutA and its mutants were expressed, purified, and
crystallized as described previously for wild-type BjPutA. Briefly, crystals were grown in sitting drops
at room temperature in the presence of ∼2 M ammonium sulfate
and cryoprotected with glycerol. For some of
the mutants, microseeding was used with a seed stock made initially
by crushing crystals of the wild-type enzyme. Seed stocks made from
crystals of the mutant enzymes were used in subsequent rounds of crystallization
trials. The space group is C2 with a BjPutA dimer
in the asymmetric unit. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected
at beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source using a NOIR-1 detector.
The data were integrated with MOSFLM and
scaled with SCALA. Refinements in PHENIX were initiated from models derived from the
structure of wild-type BjPutA [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3HAZ]. COOT was used for model building. The structures
were validated with MolProbity and the
PDB validation server. Data collection
and refinement statistics are listed in Table .

The substrate-channeling cavity/tunnel
system was analyzed and visualized with VOIDOO, which characterizes cavities, and MOLE,, which finds tunnels that connect cavities to the bulk medium. Hydrogen
atoms were added to the protein with the WHAT IF web services prior
to these calculations. VOIDOO was run
in probe-occupied mode (option O) with a probe radius of 2.9 Å,
which approximates P5C/GSA. This radius was chosen on the basis
of molecular volume calculations performed with VOIDOO; P5C and GSA
have volumes of 104 and 124 Å3, respectively, which
correspond to spheres with radii
of 2.9 and 3.1 Å, respectively. MOLE was run with default options
and using Arg456 of the PRODH
active site as the starting point.

Models of P5C and GSA were
built into the cavity/tunnel system
to understand the steric relationships and estimate the number of
intermediates that the system accommodates. The starting models were
downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
PubChem database [compound identification numbers 193305 (GSA) and
11966181 (P5C)]. A model of P5C bound in the BjPutA PRODH active site
was built using the structure of GsPutA complexed with the proline
analogue l-tetrahydro-2-furoic acid (PDB entry 4NMA). A model
of GSA bound in the BjPutA P5CDH active site was built using the structure
of mouse P5CDH complexed with glutamate (PDB entry 3V9K). Models of GSA
were fit manually into the tunnel between the two active sites and
the off-pathway cavity.

Results
Rationale for Channel-Blocking
Mutagenesis and Purification
of BjPutA Mutant Enzymes
The BjPutA dimer (PDB entry 3HAZ) was analyzed with
the PyMOL plug-in CAVER, and MOLE 2.0 to identify
residues lining the cavity/tunnel system
that, upon mutation to a larger side chain, might eliminate sections
of the channeling apparatus. Using starting points in the PRODH site,
the programs identified several channels leading to the bulk solvent,
including some that connect the two active sites (Figure A). (Although the tunnel appears to be open to the
bulk medium as shown for the protomer in Figure A, we note that it is buried by the dimerization flap of the corresponding
protomer in the tetramer that forms in solution.) This tunnel features
a prominent central section that runs between and parallel to two
helices, helix α5a of the PRODH domain (residues 346–356)
and helix 770s of the P5CDH domain (residues 773–785). Side
chains of these helices contribute to the walls of the tunnel.
The central section is 25 Å in length and 4–8
Å in diameter and can accommodate two to three molecules of GSA
(Figure B).

Analysis with VOIDOO also
identifies a cavity that is connected
to the central section of the predicted tunnel (Figure C). This “off-pathway” cavity has a volume of
∼700 Å3, which is sufficient to accommodate
another two to three molecules of GSA.

Four residues lining
the central section of the tunnel were selected
for mutagenesis: Thr348, Ser607, Asp778, and Asp779. Thr348 and Ser607
sit near the beginning and end of the central section, respectively,
while Asp778 and Asp779 are closer to the middle of the central section,
near the off-pathway cavity (Figure B). Each
of the targeted residues was mutated to Tyr, which retains polarity
while increasing steric bulk. Additionally, Asp779 was mutated to
Trp and Ala. The Trp mutation further increases side chain bulk, whereas
Ala decreases the size and removes the functional property of the
side chain carboxylate.

All six BjPutA mutant proteins, T348Y,
S607Y, D778Y, D779Y, D779W,
and D779A, were purified and shown to have flavin spectra similar
to that of wild-type BjPutA with flavin peak absorbances at 380 and
451 nm. From the flavin absorbance spectra, the percent bound flavin
was estimated to be 74–99% per monomer for the mutants, which
is similar to 79% bound flavin
for wild-type BjPutA.

Channeling Assays of BjPutA Mutants
The impact of the
mutations on channeling was evaluated by measuring coupled PRODH-P5CDH
activity. The assay involves monitoring the progress curve of the
production of NADH from proline and determining whether an initial
lag phase is apparent in NADH formation. As shown in Figure , the production of NADH
by wild-type BjPutA does not exhibit a perceptible lag time, which
is consistent with channeling. The progress curves of NADH formation
with BjPutA mutants T348Y, S607Y, D778Y, and D779A likewise show no
substantial lag phase, indicating that substrate channeling is unperturbed
in these mutants (Figure ). The linear rate
of NADH formation achieved with these mutants is similar to that of
the wild type (∼1.4
μM/min) at the same enzyme concentration (0.187
μM). No significant NADH formation, however, was observed with
BjPutA mutants D779Y and D779W (Figure ).

Channeling
assays of wild-type BjPutA and its mutants. Assays were
performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM
MgCl2) with 0.187 μM BjPutA enzyme, 40 mM proline,
100 μM CoQ1, and 200 μM NAD+.

Mutants D779Y and D779W were then
assayed using
an up to 10-fold higher concentration of enzyme (1.87 μM) and
fluorescence spectroscopy to detect NADH formation (Figure ). Increasing the D779Y concentration to 10-fold
higher than that of wild-type BjPutA (0.187 μM) resulted in
a similar rate of NADH formation, suggesting that the coupled PRODH–P5CDH
activity of D779Y is ∼10-fold lower than that of wild-type
BjPutA (Figure A). At a 10-fold higher D779W
concentration, NADH formation remained very slow, indicating that
the D779W mutant is severely impaired (Figure B).

Channeling assays with increasing concentrations of D779Y (A) and
D779W (B). NADH formation was monitored using fluorescence by exciting
at 340 nm and recording the emission at 460 nm. Assays were performed
with wild-type BjPutA (0.187 μM) and increasing concentrations
of mutants (0.187–1.87 μM) in 50 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) containing 40 mM proline,
100 μM CoQ1, and 200 μM NAD+.

Steady-State Kinetic Properties
of Wild-Type BjPutA and Its
Mutants
The kinetic parameters of PRODH and P5CDH were then
determined for wild-type BjPutA and its mutants. The steady-state
kinetic parameters of the PRODH domain were determined using proline
and CoQ1 as substrates (Table ).
Similar kcat/Km values (within ∼2-fold) were found for wild-type BjPutA and
all the mutants except D778Y.
D778Y exhibited comparable Km values for
proline (91 mM) and CoQ1 (82 μM), but its kcat value was nearly 9-fold lower than that
of wild-type BjPutA, resulting in a significantly lower kcat/Km. This result was unexpected
because D778Y exhibited activity similar to that of wild-type BjPutA
in the channeling assays (Figure ).

The kinetic parameters of P5CDH were also determined for wild-type
BjPutA and its mutants (Table ). The kcat/Km values for
P5CDH activity in the mutants were similar to those of wild-type BjPutA
except for mutants D779Y and D779W. The kcat/Km values of D779Y and D779W were 81-
and 941-fold lower, respectively, than that of wild-type BjPutA. To
determine whether perturbations in NAD+ binding account
for the severe loss of P5CDH activity, NAD+ binding was
measured for wild-type BjPutA and its mutants (Table ). For wild-type BjPutA, dissociation constants (Kd) of 0.6 and 1.5 μM were determined by intrinsic
tryptophan fluorescence quenching (Figure A) and ITC (Figure B), respectively. The Kd values of binding of NAD+ to the
BjPutA mutants were shown by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching
to be similar to that of wild-type BjPutA (Table ). Thus, NAD+ binding is unchanged in the mutants,
suggesting that the severe decrease in P5CDH activity of D779Y and
D779W is not caused by alterations in the Rossmann fold domain.

Binding of
NAD+ to BjPutA. (A) Wild-type BjPutA (0.25
μM) was titrated with increasing concentrations of NAD+ (0–20 μM) in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).
The inset is a plot of the change in tryptophan fluorescence vs [NAD+] fit to a single-site binding isotherm. A Kd value of 0.60 ± 0.04 μM was estimated for
the NAD+–BjPutA complex. (B) ITC analysis of binding
of NAD+ to wild-type BjPutA. The top panel shows the raw
data of wild-type BjPutA (23.4 μM) titrated with increasing
amounts of NAD+ in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5). The bottom
panel shows the integration of the titration data. The binding of
NAD+ to BjPutA is shown to be exothermic, and a best fit
of the data to a single-site binding isotherm yielded a Kd of 1.5 ± 0.2 μM.

Because the D778Y mutant exhibited no change
in P5CDH activity, we sought to determine whether the 9-fold lower
PRODH activity impacts the kinetic parameters of the overall PRODH–P5CDH
coupled reaction. Steady-state parameters for the overall reaction
were determined for wild-type BjPutA and the D778Y mutant by varying
the proline concentration and following NADH formation. The overall
reaction shows substrate inhibition at high proline concentrations.
A Km of 56 ± 30 mM proline and a kcat of 0.49 ± 0.21 s–1 were determined for wild-type BjPutA with a Ki for proline of 24 ± 12 mM. For D778Y, a Km of 27 ± 9 mM proline and a kcat of 0.25 ± 0.05 s–1 were determined
with a Ki for
proline of 120 ± 36 mM. The kcat/Km values for the overall reaction are thus similar,
8.8 ± 5.9 and 9.3 ± 3.4 M–1 s–1 for wild-type BjPutA and D778Y, respectively. These results
indicate that the 9-fold lower PRODH activity of D778Y does not diminish
the overall PRODH–P5CDH reaction rate of this mutant, which
is consistent with the channeling assays depicted in Figure .

Single-Turnover Rapid-Reaction Kinetics
To further
corroborate impaired channeling activity in the D779Y mutant, single-turnover
experiments were performed anaerobically without an electron acceptor
for the flavin cofactor. In this experiment, the PutA enzyme and NAD+ were rapidly mixed with proline and the absorbance spectrum
was recorded (Figure ). Observed rate constants
for FAD reduction and NADH formation were estimated by single-exponential
fits of absorbance changes at 451 and 340 nm, respectively. The observed
rate constant
for FAD reduction was faster for BjPutA mutant D779Y (0.46 s–1) than for wild-type BjPutA (0.18 s–1). In contrast,
the observed rate constant for NADH formation
is 10-fold slower in D779Y (0.003 s–1) than in wild-type
BjPutA (0.03 s–1), which is consistent with severely
impaired P5CDH activity.

for wild-type BjPutA
and mutant D779Y. (A) Wild-type BjPutA (21.3 μM) and (B) BjPutA
mutant D779Y (17.9 μM) were incubated with 100 μM NAD+ and rapidly mixed with 40 mM proline (all concentrations
reported as final) and monitored by stopped-flow multiwavelength absorption
(300–700 nm). Insets showing FAD (451 nm) and NAD+ (340 nm) reduction vs time fit to a single-exponential equation
to obtain the observed rate constant (kobs) of FAD and NAD+ reduction. Note that the inset in panel
B is on a longer time scale.

Alternative P5CDH Substrates
The potential tunnel constriction
in the D779Y and D779W mutants was explored by measuring P5CDH activity
with smaller aldehyde substrates. Table  shows
the kinetic parameters of wild-type BjPutA and mutants D779A, D779Y,
and D779W with exogenous P5C/GSA and smaller substrates succinate
semialdehyde and propionaldehyde. Succinate semialdehyde contains
one fewer carbon and no amino group, whereas propionaldehyde is a
three-carbon aldehyde. The kcat/Km values were significantly lower for each enzyme
using the smaller substrates (Table ). To
assess whether succinate semialdehyde and propionaldehyde are more
effective substrates in the mutants than P5C/GSA is, the kcat/Km ratio of wild-type
BjPutA and each mutant [(kcat/Km)WT/(kcat/Km)mut] was determined for
all the substrates. For D779A, the (kcat/Km)WT/(kcat/Km)mut ratio
remained ∼1 with each substrate. For the D779Y and D779W mutants,
the ratios
of (kcat/Km)WT/(kcat/Km)mut ratios were 81 and 941, respectively,
with P5C/GSA. The (kcat/Km)WT/(kcat/Km)mut ratios decreased to 30 (D779Y)
and 38 (D779W) with succinate semialdehyde, suggesting that relative
to P5C/GSA this smaller substrate more readily accesses the P5CDH
active site in mutants D779Y and D779W. A further decrease in the
(kcat/Km)WT/(kcat/Km)mut ratio, however, was not observed with propionaldehyde.

Kinetic Parameters of P5CDH with Alternative
Substrates
Assays were performed
in 50 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl) with 0.2 mM NAD+.

Crystal structures of D778Y, D779Y, and D779W
The structures
of D778Y, D779Y, and D779W were determined at 2.2–2.3 Å
resolution (Table ). The electron density
features representing the mutated
side chains are strong in all three mutant enzymes (Figure A–C).

changes. (A) Electron

density map for D779W. (D) Superposition of BjPutA (gray), D778Y (gold),
D779Y (cyan), and D779W (magenta). The cages in panels A–C
represent simulated annealing σA-weighted F0 - Fc omit maps
contoured at 2.5σ.

The mutations induce rotations of neighboring
side chains but otherwise have minimal impact on the protein structure
(Figure D). In the wild-type enzyme structure,
Asp778 and Arg200 are within 2.8 Å of each other and form an
ion pair; the mutation of Asp778 to the
larger Tyr would result in steric clash in the absence of conformational
changes. Clash is avoided because Tyr778 has rotated by 100°
around χ1 relative to Asp778 of the wild-type enzyme.
This movement is accompanied by rotation of Arg200 into the space
occupied by the carboxylate of Asp778 in the wild-type enzyme. In
contrast to D778Y, mutation of Asp779 to Tyr or Trp does not change
χ1. Nevertheless, these mutations cause rotations
of His919 and Gln775 to prevent steric clash with the new, bulkier
side chain at position 779 (Figure D). Aside
from these local perturbations, no other significant structural changes
are evident. In particular, the active site structures are essentially
unchanged.

Mutation of Asp778 to Tyr substantially changes the
off-pathway
cavity located near the central section of the predicted channeling
pathway. Asp778 borders this cavity in wild-type BjPutA (Figure C). Because of the aforementioned 100° rotation
around χ1, the phenol ring of Tyr778 invades the
space corresponding to the off-pathway cavity of the wild-type enzyme
(Figure ). The presence of Tyr778 in this
region reduces the volume of the cavity by 70% to 200 Å3, so that just a residual cavity remains (Figure , blue surface). Furthermore, the close approach
of Tyr778 to Arg356 severs the connection between the cavity and the
predicted channeling tunnel (using a 2.9 Å probe). Thus, the
structure suggests that P5C/GSA molecules that
are moving through the tunnel of D778Y cannot enter the off-pathway
cavity.

cylinder represents the channeling pathway calculated from the wild-type
BjPutA structure (PDB entry 3HAZ) using MOLE, and the view is from the P5CDH active
site looking through the tunnel toward the PRODH site. The red mesh
represents the off-pathway cavity of wild-type BjPutA calculated using
VOIDOO, while the blue surface represents the residual off-pathway
cavity of D778Y, also calculated with VOIDOO.

In contrast to the D778Y mutation, the mutation
of Asp779 to Tyr constricts the predicted channeling tunnel without
affecting the off-cavity pathway (Figure ).
The side chain of Tyr779 pokes into the space corresponding to the
central section of the tunnel in the wild-type enzyme (Figure A). As a result, the predicted tunnel of D779Y has
a 2.0 Å invagination near the phenol hydroxyl (Figure B). This narrowing of the tunnel reflects a decrease
in distance
between helices 770s and α5a. In particular, the distance between
the side chains of residue 779 and Lys351 decreases from 9.3 Å
in the wild-type enzyme to only 6.8 Å in D779Y. Thus, the gap
between these side chains decreases by ∼2.5 Å, which accounts
for the invagination of the tunnel near Tyr779.

(gray surface) and D779Y (red mesh).

The mutation of Asp779 to Trp similarly reshapes
the predicted channeling tunnel (Figure ).
As in D779Y, the bulky side chain of Trp779 penetrates the space corresponding
to the tunnel in the wild-type enzyme (Figure A). Also, Gln775, which has rotated relative to the wild-type enzyme,
protrudes into the tunnel just upstream from Trp779. The invasion
of the tunnel by these residues reshapes the predicted channeling
pathway, essentially shaving a 2 Å slice off one side of the
tunnel (Figure B).

Discussion
Introducing residues with bulkier side chains
into a predicted
channeling path is a useful approach for validating substrate channeling
and exploring the structural architecture of an interconnecting path
between active sites. In tryptophan synthase, substitution of βCys170
with Trp in the tunnel pathway significantly hindered passage of the
indole intermediate between active sites and also impacted communication
between subunits. In the bifunctional
enzyme dethiobiotin synthetase (DTBS)-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase
(DAPAT-AT) from Arabidopsis, two mutations were made
in a crevice on the surface connecting the two active sites. The surface crevice was proposed to be a channel
pathway for movement of the intermediate from DAPA-AT to DTBS. Mutation
of two crevice residues, Ser360 to Tyr and Ile793 to Trp, resulted
in long lag times (∼10–12 min) for product formation,
whereas no lag phase was observed with
the wild-type enzyme. These results were consistent with the predicted
function of the crevice as a channeling path.

Here, we substituted
four residues at different points along the
predicted channeling path in BjPutA with bulkier side chains. Although
Thr348 and Ser607 are located at apparent bottleneck regions and Asp778
points toward the middle of the channel, substitutions of these residues
with
Tyr did not impact PRODH–P5CDH channeling activity in BjPutA.
Only replacement of Asp779 with Tyr or Trp disrupted coupled PRODH–P5CDH
activity. Substitution of Asp779 with Ala did not diminish channeling,
indicating that the carboxylate group of Asp779 is not critical for
channel function. The decrease in the substrate channeling activity
of the D779Y and D779W mutants correlates with a significant drop
in P5CDH activity, whereas the PRODH activity of the mutants is similar
to that of wild-type BjPutA. The X-ray crystal structures of the D779Y
and D779W mutants show that the PRODH and P5CDH domains are essentially
unchanged from that of wild-type BjPutA. The only structural perturbations
are in the side chain conformations of residues near Asp779. Thus,
the severely impaired substrate channeling and P5CDH activities of
the D779Y and D779W mutants are likely caused by local effects of
substituting a larger side chain in the channel. Replacing Asp779
with Tyr decreased the internal width of the predicted channeling
path between helices 770s (residues 773–785) and α5a
by 2.5 Å or ∼25%. In D779W, the Trp residue carves into
the channel by 2.0 Å. These changes result in a narrowing of
the tunnel that is sufficient
to disrupt substrate channeling and illustrates that the channel structure
is finely tuned for transporting P5C/GSA. The results with D779Y and
D779W also validate the tunnel in BjPutA identified by X-ray crystallography
as the path for channeling the P5C/GSA intermediate.

An outstanding
question in PutA enzymes is how P5C/GSA accesses
the P5CDH active site. Because the X-ray crystal structures of D779Y
and D779W show no changes in the P5CDH active site relative to that
of wild-type BjPutA, the significantly lower P5CDH activity of the
D779Y and D779W mutants indicates exogenous P5C enters the tunnel
upstream of Asp779 possibly via the PRODH active site. If P5C/GSA
were able to enter the P5CDH active site from a point downstream of
Asp779, the P5CDH activity of the D779Y/W mutants would be expected
to be similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. These results indicate
that exogenous P5C/GSA must access the P5CDH domain through the channel,
a feature that is similar to tryptophan synthase in which the indole
intermediate enters the β-subunit active site only via the intramolecular
tunnel. The kinetic results using smaller
aldehydes as exogenous substrates are consistent with this interpretation.
Although the activity of D779W with succinate semialdehyde is still
lower than that of wild-type BjPutA, the difference in kcat/Km between wild-type BjPutA
and D779W is reduced by 25-fold relative to that of GSA.

Even
though it neighbors Asp779, replacing Asp778 with Tyr did
not diminish the substrate channeling and P5CDH activities of BjPutA.
Similar to the D779Y and D779W mutants, the X-ray crystal structure
of D778Y shows no changes in the PRODH and P5CDH domains as only perturbations
in local residues of the channel were observed. Introducing a bulkier
side chain at Asp778 appears to close the off-pathway cavity from
the main channeling path. The coupled PRODH–P5CDH activity
of the D778Y mutant is similar to that of wild-type BjPutA, demonstrating
that the off-pathway cavity is not required for substrate channeling.
The function of the off-cavity pathway in substrate channeling thus
remains unknown. An interesting finding with the D778Y mutant was
its significantly lower PRODH activity. This result may provide additional
evidence of a communication link between the PRODH domain and the
channel. Recently, we have shown in PutA from E. coli that a substrate channeling step becomes activated during enzyme
turnover, thereby increasing the overall PRODH–P5CDH activity
by nearly 40-fold. PutA also undergoes
a conformational change upon flavin reduction, with a conserved ion
pair (Arg456–Glu197) proposed to act as a gate between the
PRODH domain and the main channeling pathway., Residues that are critical for communication between the PRODH domain
and the channel are unknown, but the findings with D778Y suggest that
helix 770s (residues 773–785) may be involved. Despite having
9-fold lower PRODH activity, D778Y
exhibited substrate channeling activity similar to that of wild-type
BjPutA, consistent with the rate of the coupled PRODH–P5CDH
reaction being limited by a channeling step as found previously for E. coli PutA.

Structural
analysis of the channeling path in BjPutA provides new
insight into how P5C/GSA is shuttled between the PRODH and P5CDH active
sites. Our results suggest that the off-pathway cavity is dispensable
for channeling, which implies that the intermediate is constrained
to travel through the cylindrical middle section of the tunnel that
runs parallel to helices α5a and 770s (residues 773–785)
(Figure B). The dimensions of this section
are consistent with a maximum of two to three intermediates simultaneously
occupying the middle
section. Furthermore, because the tunnel diameter is similar to the
length scales of P5C and GSA, rotational and torsional motions of
the intermediates are constrained. In particular, it is unlikely that
P5C or GSA can flip orientation while in the tunnel, and torsional
motion of GSA is probably restricted. Thus, if the hydrolysis reaction
occurs upstream of the P5CDH active site, GSA likely travels though
the tunnel with the aldehyde group directed toward the P5CDH active
site, as shown in Figure B. Potentially, the
amino and carboxylic groups of GSA may have a critical role in properly
directing its movement and orientation in the tunnel.
