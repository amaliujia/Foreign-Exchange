Plasmin is
a multifunctional
proteolytic enzyme (MW 92 000) that circulates in blood as
a single-chain inactive zymogen, plasminogen. Although plasminogen is expressed ubiquitously in the body, hepatocytes represent the predominant site of
its synthesis., Circulating plasminogen has an
N-terminal glutamic acid (Glu–Plg) and contains a PAN/apple
domain, five kringle domains, and the C-terminal latent serine protease
domain. Native plasminogen exists in a
tight conformation in which the PAN/apple domain is bound to the kringle
5 domain., Upon cleavage of the Arg561–Val562
scissile bond, single-chain plasminogen is converted to a disulfide-linked
two-chain active protease, plasmin., The heavy chain
of Glu-plasmin consists of the PAN/apple domain and five kringle domains,
whereas the light chain contains the C-terminal protease domain. Plasminogen can be activated by either urokinase
plasminogen activator (uPA) or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).− Through self-catalysis, Lys-plasmin (and Lys-plasminogen) is formed
that lacks the PAN/apple domain., Because of the absence
of interaction(s) between the PAN/apple domain and the kringle 5 domain,
Lys-plasminogen exist in a more open conformation than Glu–Plg., Importantly, Lys-plasminogen is more readily activated by plasminogen
activators as compared to Glu–Plg., Plasminogen activators, tPA and uPA, are inhibited by plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and PAI-2,, whereas plasmin is inhibited by α2-antiplasmin and α2-macroglobulin.

Plasmin plays an important role in fibrinolysis
and is responsible
for clot lysis at the site of thrombus formation. During fibrinolysis, plasminogen is primarily activated
by tPA, which is released from the damaged endothelium., Starting at the N-terminus, tPA consists of a finger domain, an
epidermal growth factor-like domain, two kringle domains, and a C-terminal
protease domain., The finger domain and the second
kringle domain of tPA bind to the C-terminal lysine residues exposed
in the thrombus clot., Plasminogen is also localized
to the fibrin clot via its kringle domains 1 and 4, where tPA locally
converts it to plasmin. During degradation
of fibrin, plasmin generates additional C-terminal lysine residues,
which enhances tPA and plasminogen/plasmin binding to the clot for
efficient lysis. Furthermore, as compared
to the circulating plasmin, fibrin-bound plasmin is poorly inhibited
by α2-antiplasmin. Thus,
such a localized mechanism of fibrinolysis prevents degradation of
circulating fibrinogen.

In severe trauma and during major
surgical procedures, such as cardiac surgery, the fibrinolytic system
is hyperactivated., In trauma, uncontrolled bleeding
is the leading cause of preventable death. Antifibrinolytic agents when used prophylactically can significantly
reduce blood loss and the need for extensive blood transfusions.,, Aprotinin (bovine pancreatic
trypsin inhibitor, BPTI), a potent inhibitor of the plasmin active
site, has been the leading antifibrinolytic agent used to prevent
blood loss in cardiovascular bypass surgery. However, because of its side effects such as kidney damage, myocardial
infarction, and anaphylactic potential, it has been removed from the
clinical market.− The presently used antifibrinolytic agents are tranexamic
acid (TE) and ε-aminocaproic acid (εACA); both of these lysine analogues are less effective than
aprotinin and are also associated with kidney failure and seizures., Thus, a molecule with superior efficacy is desirable for use an
antifibrinolytic agent.

The plasminogen system also plays an
essential role in pericellular
proteolysis-dependent degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM)− and activation of cytokines. Plasmin
activates several pro-matrix metalloproteases (proMMPs), including
proMMPs 3, 9, 12, and 13,, that degrade other
matrix components such as collagens., Furthermore,
plasmin plays a significant role in angiogenesis by releasing certain
matrix-associated growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor
and vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as
in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β. Thus, plasmin is involved in inflammation, wound
healing, cell migration, tumor growth, and apoptosis. All of these functions are attributed to uPA (in association
with uPA receptor)-mediated activation of plasminogen bound to the
cell surface receptors present on monocytes/macrophages, smooth muscle
cells, endothelial and epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts
as well as platelets. Plasminogen receptors
with C-terminal lysine residues are abundantly expressed by different
cell types,− and invasive properties of tumor cells are dependent
on plasmin-mediated proteolysis of ECM., Thus, attenuating
plasminogen activation by preventing its binding to the cell surface
receptors and inhibiting the formed plasmin could be an attractive
target for controlling these pathological processes.

Tissue
factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2), also known as placental
protein 5 or matrix serine protease inhibitor, contains three Kunitz-type
inhibitory domains in tandem.− Kunitz domain 1 (KD1) of TFPI-2
is the only inhibitory domain, and it inhibits plasmin, factor (F)
XIa, plasma kallikrein (pKLK), and FVIIa/tissue factor. Using serine protease subsite S2′/P2′
profiling, we designed a variant KD1-L17R
molecule that is a much more potent inhibitor of plasmin; furthermore,
it does not inhibit pKLK or FXIa. (For
KD1 and BPTI residue numbering, KD1 and BPTI residues P2, P1, P1′,
and P2′ are numbered according to Schechter and Berger. The corresponding subsites are S2, S1, S1′,
and S2′ in the enzyme, respectively. The residue numbering
corresponds to BPTI such that residue 15 is at the P1 position and
residue 17 is at the P2′ position. For comparison, KD1 is numbered
using the BPTI numbering system such that residues 15 and 17 in BPTI
correspond to residues 24 and 26 in KD1, respectively. Thus, the residues
in KD1 differ by nine from BPTI.) The Escherichia coli expressed KD1-L17R has a C-terminal
valine and nine residues at the N-terminus that are not part of the
Kunitz domain; it is termed here as KD1L17R-VT. (For the KD1L17R-VT designation, KD1L17R-VT contains residues 1–73 of human TFPI-2;
it also has four additional residues (Gly-Ser-His-Met) at the N-terminus
that were introduced during cloning. It has a C-terminal valine residue.) In this article, we obtained a smaller molecular
species that has C-terminal lysine and lacks the first 7–9
residues; it is referred to as KD1L17R-KT. (For
the KD1L17R-KT designation, approximately 80%
of the KD1L17R-KT contains residues 8–72,
and the remaining 20% has residues 10 (residue 1 in BPTI)–72
of human TFPI-2; it has a C-terminal lysine residue. Here, these two
species are collectively referred to as KD1L17R-KT.) Structural and functional characterization of KD1L17R-KT, including its inhibition of plasmin and binding to
the kringle domains of plasminogen, are presented here. KD1L17R-KT with its dual function might be a preferred agent
for controlling plasmin generation and its inhibition in pathological
processes.

Expression
and Purification of KD1L17R-VT
Residues
1–73 of human TFPI-2 containing the KD1
cDNA sequence were cloned and overexpressed as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS using the T7 promoter system.− Point mutant KD1L17R-VT was generated using
the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla,
CA). His6-tagged KD1L17R-VT was expressed
in E. coli grown in Luria broth containing
15 mg/L of kanamycin and induced at 37 °C with 1 mM IPTG. His6-tagged KD1L17R-VT was purified from
the inclusion bodies and refolded as described.,−

Purified His6-tagged KD1L17R-VT was digested with IIa at a 1:1000 enzyme/substrate
molar ratio for 2 h at 37 °C. Complete digestion of KD1 by IIa
was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of temporal aliquots. His6-tag-free protein was separated
from the His6 tag and IIa using Superdex-200 gel-filtration
chromatography equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing
100 mM NaCl (TBS). The preparation was
characterized with respect to protein concentration using an extinction
coefficient (A280) of 2.45 at 1 mg/mL,
purity (SDS-PAGE), N-terminal sequence, and mass spectrometry prior
to its use in biochemical experiments.

Preparation and Isolation
of KD1L17R-KT
Incubation of KD1L17R-VT (1 mg/mL
in TBS at pH 7.5) with IIa at a 1:50 enzyme/substrate molar ratio
for 24 h at 37 °C resulted in a smaller KD1L17R-KT molecular species. KD1L17R-KT was separated
from IIa using Superdex-200 gel-filtration chromatography equilibrated
with TBS, pH 7.5. Purified KD1L17R-KT was characterized with respect to protein concentration
using an extinction coefficient (A280)
of 2.84 at 1 mg/mL, purity (SDS-PAGE), N-terminal sequence, and mass
spectrometry prior to its use in biochemical experiments.

SDS-PAGE
SDS-PAGE was performed using the Laemmli buffer
system. The acrylamide concentration
used was between 10 and 15%, and the gels were stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue dye.

Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Mass Spectrometry
For N-terminal sequence analysis, proteins were transferred to
the
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane from the reduced SDS-PAGE gel.
Automated N-terminal protein sequencing was performed using a pulsed-liquid
solid-phase sequenator with online phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino
acid analysis (Applied Biosystems cLC system) at the UCLA Biopolymer
Core facility. Mass spectrometry (MS) data were collected by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MS and electrospray ionization
(ESI)-MS. The protein solution was desalted and concentrated prior
to MS measurements using reversed-phase media packed into pipet tips
(C4-resin ZipTip, Millipore, Billerica, MA). A Voyager DE-STR MALDI
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) operating in the linear mode was used for the MALDI-MS measurements.
The protein sample solution (0.5 μL) was spotted onto a stainless
steel sample plate followed by 0.5 μL of the MALDI matrix solution,
α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA). The spotted samples were
allowed to dry at room temperature prior to data acquisition. ESI-MS
data was collected using a nanospray source and a solariX hybrid 15-T
Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer
(Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA).

KD1L17R-KT Binding to tPA and Glu–Plg
Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
Binding studies were
performed on a Biacore T100 flow biosensor (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden)
at 25 °C. Glu–Plg (∼98% purity using SDS-PAGE)
or tPA (&gt;98% purity using SDS-PAGE) was immobilized on a carboxymethyl-dextran
flow cell (CM5 sensor chips, GE Healthcare) using amine-coupling chemistry.
Flow-cell surfaces were activated with a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide for 5 min (flow rate
of 10 μL/min), after which the protein (20 μg/mL in 10
mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5) was injected onto the surface. Unreacted
sites were blocked for 5 min with 1 M ethanolamine. Each analyte (KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT, 100–2000
nM) was perfused through flow cells in HBS-P buffer (20 mM HEPES,
pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) P20) at 10 μL/min for
6 min. After changing to HBS-P buffer without the protein, analyte
dissociation was monitored for 10 min. Flow cells were regenerated
with HBS-P containing 20 mM εACA. Data were corrected for nonspecific
binding by subtracting signals obtained with the analyte infused through
a flow cell without the coupled protein. Binding was analyzed with
BIAevaluation software (Biacore) using a 1:1 binding model. Kd values were calculated from the quotient of
the derived dissociation (kd) and association
(ka) rate constants.

Protease Inhibition
Assay
All reactions were carried
out in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mg/mL BSA (TBS/BSA) and 2 mM Ca2+ (TBS/BSA/Ca2+, pH 7.5) as described., Each enzyme (plasmin, pKLK, and FXIa) was incubated
with various concentrations (10–1 to 2 × 103 nM) of KD1L17R-KT for 1 h at rt in
a 96-well microtitration plate (total volume of 100 μL). A synthetic
substrate (5 μL) appropriate for each enzyme was then added
to a final concentration of 1 Km, and
residual amidolytic activity was measured in a Molecular Devices Vmax kinetic microplate reader. The inhibition
constant, Ki*, was determined using the nonlinear regression data analysis program
GraFit. Data for KD1L17R-KT was analyzed with
an equation for a tight-binding inhibitor (eq ) where vi and v0 are the inhibited and uninhibited rates, respectively, and
[I]0 and [E]0 are the total concentrations of inhibitor and enzyme, respectively.,Ki values were obtained by correcting for the effect of
substrate according
to Beith using eq , where [S] is the substrate concentration and Km is specific for each enzyme.

Fibrinolysis (Clot Lysis) Assay
The method of Sperzel
and Huetter was followed with minor modifications
as outlined earlier. Briefly, IIa was
used to initiate fibrin formation in NPP, and the lysis of the formed
clot (fibrinolysis) was induced by simultaneous addition of tPA. Clot
formation and lysis were monitored with a Molecular Devices microplate
reader (SPECTRAmax 190) measuring the optical density at 405 nm. Briefly,
10 μL of each test compound (KD1L17R-VT, KD1L17R-KT, and εACA) or saline control
was added to 240 μL of NPP. Two-hundred twenty-five microliters
of this mixture was then added to 25 μL of IIa and tPA in TBS/BSA
containing 25 mM CaCl2. In the 250 μL final volume,
the concentration of IIa was 0.15 μg/mL and that of tPA was
1 μg/mL. Under control conditions (zero tPA and zero test compound),
OD405 increased immediately, indicating clotting, followed
by an extremely slow decrease, representing fibrinolysis. Because
clotting was almost complete after 5 min, fibrinolysis induced by
tPA was evaluated as a relative decrease of OD405 up to
60 min. KD1L17R-VT (±εACA) and KD1L17R-KT were tested at final concentrations from
2 to 5 μM and εACA (without KD1L17R-VT), from 0.1 to 5 mM.

Mouse Liver-Laceration Model
A protocol
using this
mouse model to study the efficacy of KD1L17R-VT and of KD1L17R-KT was approved by the UCLA
Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee. C57/BL6 mice (8–10
weeks old) weighing ∼20 g were used. Animals were fed standard
rodent chow and water and were housed in a vivarium room with normal
room temperature and 12 h light–dark cycles. The dosage of
KD1L17R-VT or KD1L17R-KT was based on the aprotinin dose used in humans (i.e., 4 μg/g)
adjusted for mouse weight. A calculated
blood level achieved by this dose was ∼8 μg/mL (∼1
μM). Animals injected with εACA (100 μg/g, calculated
blood level of 200 μg/mL or ∼1.3 mM) were used as positive
controls, and those receiving saline were used as negative controls.
The dosage of εACA was based on the dose used in human protocols., Polymixin B-immobilized resin (Detoxi-Gel endotoxin removing gel,
Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used to remove lipopolysaccharide from saline,
KD1L17R-VT, and KD1L17R-KT. εACA was dissolved at 20 mg/mL in lipopolysaccharide-free
saline. Both antifibrinolytic agents and saline were free of lipopolysaccharide,
as tested using the Limulus Amebocyte lysates kit (Biowhittaker Inc.,
Walkersville, MD).

Animals were injected intravenously via the
tail vein with the drug in a volume of 100 μL of sterile balanced
salt solution immediately preceding anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced
and maintained with Isoflurane. The animals were placed on a heating
pad in supine position throughout the procedure to maintain the rectal
temperature at 37 °C. The abdomen was shaved and prepped. The
liver was exposed via an anterior right subcostal incision. The left
lobe of the liver was exteriorized by gentle continuous pressure on
the left flank posteriorly. A 5 mm transverse incision was made on
the left lobe at 1 cm from its inferior edge using a sharp sterile
no. 10 scalpel blade. All blood oozing from the site of the left-lobe
incision was collected in a sterile, preweighed 3 × 3 cm2 plastic tray for a total duration of 30 min. Animals were
euthanized at the end of the 30 min period.

A factorial one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) method was used
to compare the mean total blood loss in milligrams from the mouse
liver across the four treatment groups (saline, εACA, KD1L17R-VT, and KD1L17R-KT).
The p value for comparing any two means was computed
using a posthoc test under this ANOVA model. Examination of the mean
total blood loss error distribution pooled across all four treatments
showed that it was normal (Gaussian) after controlling for the effect
of treatment. The Shapiro–Wilk goodness of fit test was used
to compare formally this distribution to a Gaussian. Thus, no transformations
of total blood loss were needed.

Reduction in Glu–Plg
Binding to U937 Cell Surface Receptors
by Micro(μ)-Plasmin–KD1L17R-KT
Recombinant N-terminal His6-tagged μ-plasminogen,
containing residues 542–791 of the human plasminogen protease
domain, was expressed as inclusion bodies
using the pET28a vector in E. coli strain
BL21(DE3). The His6-tagged μ-plasminogen was isolated
using nickel-charged His-Trap column, refolded, and purified using
SP-Sepharose FF column as outlined. Isolated
μ-plasminogen (1 mg/mL) was digested with IIa to remove the
His6 tag and was activated
to μ-plasmin by uPA at a 1:1000 enzyme/substrate molar ratio
for 2 h at 37 °C. Removal of the His6 tag and activation
to μ-plasmin was confirmed by reduced SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide).
IIa, uPA, and the His6 tag were separated from μ-plasmin
using a Superdex-200 gel-filtration column. KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT each was incubated with purified μ-plasmin at a molar ratio
of 1.2:1 for 2 h at room temperature. Each complex was then separated
from the free KD1L17R-VT or KD1L17R-KT using a Superdex-200 gel-filtration column. Details of the procedure for obtaining the μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT or μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT complex are described elsewhere (with the crystallization
and structure determination of these complexes).

U937 monocyte-like
cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 using RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as outlined earlier., The cells were stimulated with 40 nM PMA for 18 h under sterile
conditions as described. The nonadherent
cells were recovered by gentle decanting, washed, and suspended in
50 mM Hepes containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.5 (HBS/BSA,
pH 7.5). The cells (106/mL, 200 μL) were then incubated
at 37 °C for 1 h with 2 μM Glu–Plg containing varying
concentrations of μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT or μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT. The cells were washed and resuspended in 200 μL of HBS/BSA,
pH 7.5, and the cell-bound Glu–Plg was activated with 10 nM
uPA for 20 min at 37 °C. Each reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold,
and the plasmin activity (reflective of bound Glu–Plg) was
measured by S-2251 synthetic-substrate hydrolysis using the Molecular
Devices kinetic microplate reader., The IC50 (μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT concentration required for 50% decrease in Glu–Plg binding
to the cell surface receptors) was determined by fitting the data
to the following the IC50 four-parameter logistic equation
from Halfman given belowwhere y is the rate of S-2251
hydrolysis by plasmin generated from the Glu–Plg bound to the
U937 cell receptors in the presence of a given concentration of KD1L17R-KT or KD1L17R-VT represented
by x, a is the maximum rate of S-2251
hydrolysis in the absence of KD1L17R-KT or KD1L17R-VT, and s is the slope factor.
Each point was weighted equally, and the data were fitted to eq  using the nonlinear regression analysis program
GraFit from Erithcus Software. To obatian the Kd value for the interaction of KD1L17R-KT with Glu–Plg, we used the following equation, as described
by Cheng and Prusoff and further elaborated
by Craig.where [Glu–Plg] concentration employed
was 2 μM (∼physiologic concentration). To obtain the Kd (KD1L17R-KT) for Glu–Plg, we used a value of 1 μM
for Kd (Glu–Plg/cell surface receptors).,,

Molecular
Modeling
The crystal structures of μ-plasmin, plasminogen kringle domain 1, and wild-type KD1 were used
as templates to model both the binary complex of KD1L17R-KT with plasmin kringle domain 1 and the ternary complex
of KD1L17R-KT with the plasmin protease domain
and kringle domain 1. The protocols for modeling these complexes have
been described earlier., Because the C-terminus
residues are disordered in the wild-type KD1 crystal structure, we
used the MODELLER program to build this
part of the KD1 molecule. The
built models were further refined by energy minimization using the
program CHARMM with the CHARMM19 force field consisting of 50 steps of the steepest descent followed by 500 steps
of adopted basis Newton–Raphson. Harmonic restraints of 10
kcal/mol/Å2 were applied on the Cα atoms of
the protein during the entire minimization.

Results and Discussion
Proteolysis
of KD1L17R-VT by IIa
In addition to
the 58 residues corresponding to the BPTI-Kunitz domain,
the 73-residue KD1L17R-VT construct contains
additional nine residues at the N-terminus. The C-terminal tail residues
(59EKVPKV64, BPTI numbering) in KD1L17R-VT contain
two lysine residues. We investigated
whether incubation of KD1L17R-VT with higher
concentrations of IIa, as compared to those used during the removal
of His6 tag, could cleave between the K60–V61 and/or
between K63–V64 residues (59EK↓VPK↓V64). If so,
then the resulting molecule(s), in addition to inhibiting the active
site of plasmin, could also serve as a decoy receptor to attenuate
pathological plasminogen activation. Incubation of KD1L17R-VT (1 mg/mL in TBS, pH 7.5) with IIa at a 1:50 enzyme/substrate
molar ratio for 24 h at 37 °C resulted in the formation of a
smaller molecular weight species referred to as KD1L17R-KT. SDS-PAGE data of KD1L17-VT and
KD1L17R-KT are given in Figure . KD1L17R-KT was separated from IIa
using Superdex-200 gel-filtration chromatography for further studies.

SDS-PAGE
of KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT. Lane 1, mixture of reduced EZ-Run protein markers
(Fisher BioReagents); lane 2, 5 μg of unreduced KD1L17R-KT; lane 3, 5 μg of unreduced KD1L17R-VT; lane 4, 5 μg of reduced KD1L17R-KT; and lane 5, 5 μg of reduced KD1L17R-VT. The concentration of acrylamide used was 15%.

The N-terminal sequence(s) of KD1L17R-KT is
presented in Table , and the MALDI-TOF-ESI
data are presented in Figure A. Combined analysis
of the sequence(s) and the mass spectrometry data reveal that ∼80%
of KD1L17R-KT has an N-terminal GNNAEI sequence
and ∼20% has an N-terminal NAEI sequence; both species have
the same C-terminal sequence, EKVPK. Amino acid sequence alignment
of BPTI, KD1L17R-VT, and KD1L17R-KT is presented in Figure B. We interpret
this to mean that IIa cleaved KD1L17R-VT between
VPK↓V at the C-terminus; however, the hydrolysis at PT↓GN
and GN↓NA at the N-terminus could be by IIa or conceivably
by a contaminating protease(s). Notably, no cleavage was observed
between EK↓VP at the C-terminus. Thus, KD1L17R-KT is homogeneous at the C-terminus, with ∼20% of the
molecules lacking the first two amino acids at the N-terminus (Figure A,B).

MALDI-TOF-ESI mass spectrometry data and amino
acid sequence alignment
of KD1L17R-KT with the starting molecule (KD1L17R-VT) and BPTI. (A) Mass spectrometry data of
KD1L17R-KT obtained using an Applied Biosystems
Voyager DE-STR. The spectra were calibrated; thus, the masses should
be within 0.1% of the theoretical values. (B) Amino acid sequences
of KD1L17R-VT and the two KD1L17R-KT species: one with N-terminus sequence Gly-Asn-Asn-Ala-Glu-Ile
(∼80%) and a second with N-terminus sequence Asn-Ala-Glu-Ile
(∼20%). Note that the minor sequence is internal to the major
sequence starting at cycle 3 asparagine and that the calculated difference
in MW between the two species is 171 Da; this is consistent with the
mass spectrometry data shown in panel A. We infer that IIa or a contaminating
protease cleaved the peptide bonds (shown by ↓) between amino
acids Thr–Gly and Asn–Asn on the N-terminal side and
between Lys–Val on the C-terminal side of KD1L17R-VT. The numbering system used is that of BPTI (prototype
Kunitz inhibitor). The N-terminal Gly-Ser-His-Met sequence in KD1L17R-VT is derived from the IIa cleavage site introduced
during cloning. The P1 and P2′ subsites recognized by plasmin
are marked.

There were two readable sequences
one at the ∼80 pmol level and the other at the ∼20 pmol
level. Note that the minor sequence is internal to the first sequence
starting at cycle 3.

IIa
cleaves Arg/Lys (P1 subsite)-××× peptide bonds
and has a strong preference for proline or a small hydrophobic residue
at the P2 position. Furthermore, a bulky
or an acidic residue at the P2 position is strongly disfavored by
IIa., Accordingly, under the conditions of higher
concentration of IIa used, cleavage between 62Pro-Lys↓Val64
() of KD1L17R-VT is expected, whereas cleavage between 59Glu-Lys↓Val-Pro62
is disfavored (Figure B). Although threonine
or asparagine at the P1 subsite is not preferred by IIa, its S1 pocket
residue Asp189 can interact with Thr or Asn through a water molecule
(). The proteolysis between Pro-Thr↓Gly-Asn
or Gly-Asn↓Asn-Ala by IIa might also be facilitated by the
presence of Pro or Gly at the P2 position (). As a result, we obtained a stable KD1L17R-KT protein that has an intact Kunitz domain and contains a C-terminal
lysine.

KD1L17R-KT Binding to tPA and Glu–Plg
We used SPR to study the binding of KD1L17R-KT to immobilized tPA (Figure A) and Glu–Plg
(Figure B). The kon for binding of tPA to KD1L17R-KT was 0.91
± 0.2 × 103 M–1 s–1, koff was 1.9 ± 0.3 × 10–4 s–1, and Kd was 210 ± 20 nM. The kon for binding of Glu–Plg to KD1L17R-KT was 1.1 ± 0.4 × 103 M–1 s–1, koff was 3.1 ±
0.8 × 10–4 s–1, and Kd was 280 ± 30 nM. KD1L17R-VT showed negligible binding to tPA or Glu–Plg in SPR
experiments, indicating that it is the C-terminal lysine in KD1L17R-KT that is necessary for this interaction.

Interaction
of KD1L17R-KT with tPA and Glu–Plg
as measured by SPR. (A) tPA binding to KD1L17R-KT. tPA was coupled to the CM5 chip by the amine coupling method, and
an immobilization level of 1193 response units (RU) was attained for
the bound protein. Five concentrations (0.1–2 μM) of
KD1L17R-KT were used, and 6 min association
and 10 min dissociation times (flow rate of 10 μL/min) were
employed. Details are provided in the . The RU value obtained with KD1L17R-VT at 1 μM was 16 instead of 155 with KD1L17R-KT. (B) Glu–Plg binding to KD1L17R-KT. Glu–Plg was coupled to the CM5 chip, and an immobilization
level of 742 RU was attained for the bound protein. The concentrations
of KD1L17R-KT used and the analyte association
and dissociation protocols were the same as in panel A. The RU value
obtained with KD1L17R-VT at 1 μM was 12
instead of 86 with KD1L17R-KT. (C) Modeled complex
of KD1L17R-KT with plasminogen kringle domain
1. The electrostatic surface of the plasminogen kringle domain 1 and
a cartoon representation of the KD1L17R-KT (yellow)
are depicted. The residues that form hydrogen bonds and salt bridges
(shown as dashed lines) between the kringle domain and KD1L17R-KT are shown in stick representation. The carbon atoms
are shown in green for the kringle domain and yellow for KD1L17R-KT. Oxygen atoms are shown in red and nitrogen atoms,
in blue. The KD1L17R-KT residues are labeled
with the suffix I. In the electrostatic surface, blue represents positive,
red represents negative, and white represents neutral charge.

Next, we modeled the complex of
KD1L17R-KT with the kringle domain 1 of plasminogen.
The C-terminal lysine
binds in an analogous manner as εACA (Figure C). In addition, two other interactions were noted: one, a
carboxylate of Glu59 of the inhibitor KD1L17R-KT makes a salt bridge with the guanidino group of Arg32 of plasminogen,
and two, the carbonyl group of Lys60 of the inhibitor makes a hydrogen
bond with the side chain of Arg70 of kringle domain 1 of plasminogen.
These additional interactions could reflect the higher affinity of
KD1L17R-KT for kringle domain 1 of plasminogen
as compared to its affinity for εACA., Although not investigated, on the basis of the SPR affinity data,
similar interactions between tPA and KD1L17R-KT might exist.

Inhibition Profile of KD1L17R-KT
KD1L17R-KT inhibited plasmin
(Figure ) with a high affinity (Ki =1 ± 0.2 nM) very similar to KD1L17R-VT. Furthermore, both KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT inhibited FXIa and pKLK with Ki &gt; 10 μM (Figure ).
Moreover, KD1L17R-VT or KD1L17R-KT (data not
shown) did not inhibit IIa, activated protein C, tPA, uPA, or tissue
kallikreins. Collectively, the data indicate that the Kuntiz domain
in KD1L17R-KT is not altered and is fully functional.

Determination
of equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) of KD1L17R-KT with plasmin, FXIa,
and pKLK. The enzyme activity is expressed as the
percent fractional activity (inhibited rate/uninhibited rate) at increasing
inhibitor concentrations. The inhibition constants (Ki) were determined using eqs  and  as outlined in the . The concentration of plasmin used was 3 nM, whereas
FXIa and pKLK were 1 nM each.

Fibrinolysis Assay
These experiments were performed
to compare the effectiveness of KD1L17R-KT,
KD1L17R-VT, and εACA to inhibit tPA-induced
plasma clot fibrinolysis. Addition of IIa to NPP caused fibrin formation,
which is reflected by the increase in OD405 (curve 1, Figure A–C). Simultaneous addition of tPA caused
initial clot formation followed by dissolution of fibrin induced by
tPA-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (curve 2, Figure A–C); the midpoint of fibrinolysis was between
6 to 7 min in each case. All three antifibrinolytic agents inhibited
fibrinolysis in a dose-dependent manner. KD1L17R-VT increased the fibrinolysis midpoint to 22 min at 2 μM,
to 29 min at 3 μM, and to 43 min at 5 μM, respectively
(Figure A). In contrast, KD1L17R-KT increased the fibrinolysis midpoint to 27 min at 2
μM, to 37 min at 3 μM, and to &gt;60 min at 5 μM,
respectively
(Figure A). Thus, at each concentration tested,
KD1L17R-KT was more effective as an antifibrinolytic
agent as compared to KD1L17R-VT. Because the
active-site inhibition of plasmin by both KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT is similar (Figure ), the additional
increased potency of KD1L17R-KT could be due
to its binding to the kringle domains of tPA and/or plasminogen (Figure A,B). As a result, localized plasminogen activation
at the fibrin clot might also be attenuated.

Effect of KD1L17R-VT, KD1L17R-KT, and εACA
on fibrinolysis in human NPP. IIa was added
to NPP to initiate clot formation, which is associated with an increase
in optical density at 405 nm (curve 1 in panels A, B, and C). Simultaneous
addition of tPA converted plasminogen to plasmin, which dissolved
the fibrin clot completely within ∼10 min, as indicated by
an initial increase followed by a decrease in OD405 (curve
2 in panels A, B, and C). (A) Inhibition of fibrinolysis by KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT. KD1L17R-VT: 2 (red open triangles), 3 (blue open triangles),
and 5 μM (brown open triangles). KD1L17R-KT: 2 (red closed triangles), 3 (blue closed triangles), and 5 μM
(brown closed triangles). In each case, IIa was used to initiate clotting
and tPA to initiate fibrinolysis. (B) Effect of εACA on the
inhibition of fibrinolysis by KD1L17R-VT. KD1L17R-VT: 2 (red open triangles), 3 (blue open triangles),
and 5 μM (brown open triangles). KD1L17R-KT plus equimolar εACA: 2 (red closed triangles), 3 (blue closed
triangles), and 5 μM (brown closed triangles). As in panel A,
in each case, IIa was used to initiate clotting and tPA was used to
initiate fibrinolysis. (C) Inhibition of fibrinolysis by εACA
alone: 0.1 (magenta closed squares), 0.3 (blue open triangles), 0.5
(green closed triangles), 1.0 (red closed squares) and 5 mM (green
open circles). As in panels A and B, in each case, IIa was used to
initiate clotting and tPA was used to initiate fibrinolysis.

Higher concentrations of KD1L17R-VT or KD1L17R-KT were
needed to inhibit fibrinolysis than
those predicted from the Ki values for
plasmin inhibition. A most likely explanation for these observations
is that antifibrinolytic assay is a kinetic-based assay, whereas the
equilibrium inhibition constant, Ki, was
obtained upon prolonged incubation of the inhibitor with plasmin.

The antifibrinolytic activity of εACA is attributed to its
binding to the kringle domains of tPA and plasminogen., Therefore, we examined whether εACA could augment the fibrinolytic
inhibition observed for KD1L17R-VT. These data
are presented in Figure B. Equimolar additions
of εACA to the KD1L17R-VT at 2, 3, or
5 μM had no observable effect on the extent of inhibition of
plasma clot fibrinolysis. The most likely explanation for this observation
is the low affinity (Kd ∼ 10 μM), of εACA for tPA or plasminogen as compared to the KD1L17R-KT (Kd ∼
0.2 to 0.3 μM; Figure ). Consistent
with these data, much higher concentrations of εACA were needed
to inhibit plasma clot fibrinolysis in the absence of KD1L17R-VT (Figure C). Addition of εACA
increased the clot lysis midpoint to 10 min at 0.1 mM, 19 min at 0.3
mM, and &gt;60 min at 0.5 mM, respectively. Essentially no fibrinolysis
was observed when the concentrations of εACA used were 1 or
5 mM.

Mouse Liver-Laceration Model
Because augmented fibrinolysis
is an important cause of bleeding from small vessels in the mouse
liver-laceration model, we evaluated
the efficacy of KD1L17R-KT in decreasing blood
loss and compared it to the efficacy of εACA and KD1L17R-VT in this animal model. The dose of εACA, KD1L17R-KT, or KD1L17R-VT used
is comparable to the dose used in a clinical setting. Although the
half-life of each of these two antifibrinolytic agents is short (∼2
h), a total duration of bleeding for 30 min should retain a sufficient
level of each inhibitor for efficacy studies. The effects of the three
antifibrinolytic agents on the quantity of blood loss are depicted
in Figure . As compared to saline, the blood
loss was reduced by ∼74% by KD1L17R-KT (p = 0.001), ∼50% by KD1L17R-VT (p = 0.002), and ∼49% by εACA
(p = 0.002). There was essentially no difference
in the amount of blood loss between KD1L17R-VT- and εACA-treated animals. Of significance is the observation
that KD1L17R-KT is more effective than KD1L17R-VT (p &lt; 0.05) or εACA
(p &lt; 0.05) in inhibiting plasmin-induced fibrinolysis
and blood loss in this animal model.

Effect of KD1L17R-VT, KD1L17R-KT, and εACA in a mouse liver-laceration
bleeding model.
Animals were treated with saline, KD1L17R-VT, KD1L17R-KT, or εACA by intravenous
injection. A 5 mm transverse incision was made on the left lobe of
the liver. All blood oozing from the incision site was collected for
a total duration of 30 min. Total blood loss was compared between
different groups. Data are presented as the mean ± SE of 10 animals
each for saline, KD1L17R-VT, and KD1L17R-KT and 16 animals for εACA. Probability p values between different groups were as follows: saline
vs KD1L17R-VT, 0.002; saline vs KD1L17R-KT, 0.001; saline vs εACA, 0.002; KD1L17R-KT vs KD1L17R-VT, &lt; 0.05; and
KD1L17R-KT vs εACA, &lt; 0.05. *, p value &lt; 0.01 compared with saline control.

Unexpectedly, our present data with KD1L17R-KT is not statistically different from the previous data
obtained with
KD1-L17R, which was presumed to have Val at the C-terminus. To address this discrepancy, we performed SDS-PAGE,
mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequence analysis on the actual
KD1-L17R preparation used in the previous animal studies. These data
are presented in the . Evidently, the KD1-L17R previously
used is composed of 76 amino acids with an N-terminal sequence of
Gly-Ser-His and a C-terminal sequence of Val-Pro-Lys (instead of Pro-Lys-Val).
Thus, our present data with KD1L17R-KT and the
previous data with KD1-L17R (C-terminal lysine) support a concept
that these molecular species have improved efficacy than the KD1L17R-VT in preventing blood loss in the mouse liver-laceration
model.

Importantly, 4 of the 16 animals (one out of four each
day) treated
with εACA depicted generalized seizures shortly after injection
of the drug. During surgery, these animals had unilateral or bilateral
clonic movements on 3–4.5% isoflurane. Abnormal movements were
not observed during the induction of anesthesia, but rather 15–20
min after the onset of surgery. Seizures appeared as repetitive clonic
movements of one or more extremities while the animal remained unresponsive
under anesthesia. Animals were not observed to have any tonic movements.
Convulsion and seizures have been previously observed in animals given
εACA or TE and represent a major side effect of these drugs
as antifibrinolytic agents.,

Our observation
is also consistent with the recent findings that
εACA,, or TE,, cause seizures
and convulsions in a significant number of patients. The εACA
and TE concentrations associated with human seizures inhibit glycine
receptors and could be the mechanism for the observed side effects. In contrast, aprotinin did not inhibit the function
of the glycine receptors. These observations
are consistent with our animal data, where we did not observe seizures
in animals treated with either KD1L17R-VT or
KD1L17R-KT. Furthermore, the use of εACA,
TE, and aprotinin is associated with renal dysfunction/failure,−, whereas two KD1 molecules (with
Arg15 → Lys or Leu17 → Arg) of TFPI-2 did not cause
renal toxicity in mouse or rat. Thus, KD1L17R-KT could
be a preferred agent in attenuating fibrinolysis in vivo.

Effects of
μ-Plasmin–KD1L17R-KT on Glu–Plg
Binding to PMA-Stimulated Nonadherent U937 Cells
A majority
of the cell surface receptors for plasminogen have lysine
as their C-terminal residue. We examined
whether KD1L17R-KT (and not KD1L17R-VT) binds to the kringle domain(s) of Glu–Plg
and prevents its binding to the U937 cell surface receptors. First,
we prepared μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT and μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT to block
the Kuntiz domain function. The SDS-PAGE of the Superdex-200 gel-purified
complexes of μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT and μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT are
shown in the inset of Figure A. Next, we incubated
PMA-stimulated U937 cells with Glu–Plg containing varying concentrations
of μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT or μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT (given in legend to Figure A). The increasing concentrations of μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT (but not of μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT) inhibited Glu–Plg binding to the
cell surface receptors deduced from the S-2251 hydrolysis data shown
in Figure A. The percent reduction in plasmin
generation by the purified μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT or μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT is presented in Figure B. We interpret
these data to mean that the μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT complex interferes with Glu–Plg binding to
the PMA-stimulated U937 cells. Using eqs  and , a Kd value for the
interaction of KD1L17R-KT with Glu–Plg
was calculated to be ∼300 nM, a value consistent with the value
(∼280 nM) obtained from the SPR data (Figure B).

U937 cells by μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT. (A) Proteolytic activity of plasmin generated on the U937 cell
surface. PMA-stimulated U937 cells (200 μL, 106 cells/mL)
in HBS/BSA, pH 7.5, were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 2 μM
Glu–Plg containing various concentrations of μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT (ranging from 0 to 3 μM) or μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT (2 and 4 μM). The cells were washed,
and the cell-surface-bound Glu–Plg was activated with 10 nM
uPA for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were diluted 10-fold, and
the plasmin formed was measured by S-2251 synthetic-substrate hydrolysis
(OD405) as outlined in the . μ-Plasmin–KD1L17R-KT reduced the plasmin formed in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT had no effect
(see panel B). Inset, reduced SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) of the size-exclusion
gel-purified μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT and μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT. The
μ-plasmin expressed consists of residues 542–791 cleaved
between R561 (R15 in chymotrypsin numbering) and V562 (V16 in chymotrypsin
numbering). (The chymotrypsin amino acid numbering system is used
for the protease domain of plasmin and IIa. Residue 195 in chymotrypsin
numbering corresponds to 741 in plasmin and 525 in IIa. Similarly,
residue 189 in chymotrypsin numbering corresponds to 735 in plasmin
and 519 in IIa.) The heavy chain (HC) consists of residues 562–791
and the light chain consists of 20 residues of 542–561 and
is not seen on the gel. Lane 1, MW markers; lane 2, μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-KT complex; lane 3, μ-plasmin–KD1L17R-VT complex. (B) Percent reduction of plasmin

The data presented in Figure  support a
conclusion that a single molecule of KD1L17R-KT can bind simultaneously to the kringle domain of plasminogen/plasmin
as well as to the active site of plasmin. A modeled ternary complex
of KD1L17R-KT with the plasmin protease domain
and the plasminogen/plasmin kringle domain 1 is depicted in Figure . The KD1L17R-KT via its P5–P5′
residues interacts with the active site of plasmin, a typical mode
of Kunitz domain binding to a serine protease domain. Similarly, the
interactions of the C-terminal lysine of KD1L17R-KT with the kringle domain 1 of plasminogen/plasmin are analogous
to the lysine analogues εACA or TE. However, as compared to
the lysine analogues, KD1L17R-KT has additional
contacts with the kringle domain 1 of plasminogen/plasmin that makes
the binding considerably stronger (Figure ).

A cartoon representation of the KD1L17R-KT (yellow)

residues of the kringle domain 1 are shown in stick representation.
Similarly, residues Arg15 and Arg17 of the Kunitz domain that interact
with residue Asp189 and Glu73 (chymotrypsin numbering) of the plasmin
protease domain are shown in stick representation. The carbon atoms
in plasminogen/plasmin are in green, whereas they are yellow in KD1L17R-KT. Oxygen and nitrogen atoms are in red and
blue, respectively. The KD1L17R-KT residues
are labeled with the suffix I.

Conclusions
Previously, we demonstrated that changing
residue Leu17 (BPTI/aprotinin
numbering) to Arg in KD1 (73-residue construct KD1L17R-VT) of TFPI-2 abolishes its anticoagulant functions and enhances
its plasmin inhibition. KD1L17R-VT has nine residues at the N-terminus that are not part
of the Kunitz domain. Furthermore, it has valine at the C-terminus,
which would prevent its binding to the kringle domains of plasminogen/plasmin.
In this article, we obtained a KD1L17R-KT molecule
that lacks the N-terminal residues and primarily contains the Kunitz
domain with a C-terminal lysine. As expected, both KD1L17R-VT and KD1L17R-KT inhibit plasmin
with the same affinity. However, in contrast to KD1L17R-VT, KD1L17R-KT binds to the kringle
domain(s) of tPA and plasminogen via its C-terminal lysine residue.
Consequently, KD1L17R-KT (and not KD1L17R-VT) inhibits Glu–Plg binding to U937 cells and
therefore serves as a decoy plasminogen receptor. Furthermore, KD1L17R-KT inhibits tPA-induced plasma clot fibrinolysis
more potently than KD1L17R-VT (Figure A). These data represent a dual function of KD1L17R-KT: one, it attenuates tPA and plasminogen
binding to the exposed C-terminal lysine residues in the fibrin, which
reduces plasmin formation, and two, it inhibits the active site of
the generated plasmin. Thus, KD1L17R-KT is a
superior antifibrinolytic agent in each of the in vitro experiment
performed.

The efficacy of KD1L17R-KT in
reducing blood
loss in the mouse liver-laceration model is also improved (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to KD1L17R-VT (Figure ). Importantly, in the mice treated
with εACA, we observed generalized seizures in 25% of the animals.
We did not observe such adverse effects with KD1L17R-KT. With its dual function, KD1L17R-KT could be a useful agent in situations where the fybrinolytic system
needs to be significantly weakened to prevent blood loss as well as
to prevent uPA-mediated activation of plasminogen on cell surfaces.
