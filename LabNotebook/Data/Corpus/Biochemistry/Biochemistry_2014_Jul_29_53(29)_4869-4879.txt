Chlorite dismutases (Clds) are
prokaryotic heme b oxidoreductases (EC 1.13.11.49)
that convert chlorite to dioxygen and chloride. Based on subunit architecture
and oligomerization, two main clades are distinguished.− Clade 1 contains pentameric proteins including Cld from the bacterium Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii (NdCld), which was investigated
in this work. In clade 2, dimeric representatives with smaller subunit
size are found. Chlorite dismutases are suggested to have ancient
roots since similar proteins were found in many different bacterial
and archaeal phyla.,

Several crystal structures
of Clds have been published in recent years;−, these demonstrated that the only charged residue
in the distal heme cavity is a conserved arginine residue, which was
shown to be catalytically important but not essential for the degradation
of chlorite.,,

In the resting state, the heme iron of Cld is in the ferric state,
which is stabilized by the imidazolate character of the proximal histidine., It was shown by Hofbauer et al. that
the structural changes upon reduction of Cld to the ferrous form are
very small, which is in agreement with other heme enzymes.− In NdCld, the chlorite access channel has a length of 1.5 nm with
a bottleneck radius of 0.28 nm. Chlorite
(ClO2–) enters the channel and binds
to ferric heme forming the Fe(III)–ClO2 adduct.
This induces the redox reaction, which includes the heterolytic cleavage
of chlorite to hypochlorite (ClO–) with concomitant
oxidation of ferric NdCld to the compound I state (which most probably
is an oxoiron(IV) porphyrin radical). In the final reaction, hypochlorite
recombines with the ferryl oxygen of compound I thereby releasing
O2 and chloride.

In
this postulated mechanism, several issues still need clarification
including the question about the catalytic role of the distal arginine
(i.e., Arg173 in NdCld). Crystal structures have shown that this basic
amino acid can adopt two distinct conformations, either pointing toward
the heme iron (“in”) or toward the substrate channel
entry (“out”). Mutational
analyses suggested that the distal arginine is important to keep the
transiently produced hypochlorite close to the ferryl oxygen for the
rebound mechanism., On the other hand, chlorite degradation
can also occur in its absence, although significantly slower and with
increased susceptibility for irreversible inactivation.−,,,− Hofbauer et al. demonstrated
that inactivation includes heme bleaching as well as oxidation and
chlorination of amino acids of the protein moiety. The authors concluded
that hypochlorite released from the active site during turnover is
responsible for these modifications.

In this work, we study the binding of the low-spin ligand cyanide,
a known inhibitor for heme oxidases, the substrate chlorite and the
postulated intermediate hypochlorite to wild-type NdCld and the mutant
R173A by means of molecular dynamics simulations in order to gain
more information about the role of the flexible Arg173. Simulations
were performed with the heme iron in its ferrous and ferric states,
as well as compound I state (Table ). Prior
to the simulations, the series of ions ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and
ClO4– was parametrized for the GROMOS
force field., Our findings suggest that chlorite
is attracted by the ferric state and that Arg173 plays a role in the
initial substrate recognition, but not in the actual binding process,
leading to the formation of the Fe(III)–ClO2 complex.
In contrast, the conserved basic amino acid seems to support the rebound
mechanism by diminishing the escape of transiently formed hypochlorite.
The findings are discussed with respect to experimental data on catalysis
and inhibition of chlorite dismutase.

Materials and Methods
Parametrization
Experimental absolute
intrinsic hydration free energies, ΔsG⊖, for the series of Cl–, ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and ClO4– ions
were derived based on available experimental data. This involved the
formation enthalpy and entropy of the gas-phase ions, the conventional
formation free energy of the aqueous ions, and an assumed absolute
intrinsic proton hydration free energy of −1100 kJ·mol–1., The resulting absolute intrinsic
hydration free energies are given in Table , and the detailed derivation is outlined in the , Table S1. Ions ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3–, and ClO4– were reparametrized to reproduce
the experimental data. The raw simulation data was corrected by ex
post calculations according towhere ΔGchgraw is the raw
free energy of reversibly growing the partial charges of the atoms,
ΔGcav is the free energy of reversibly
growing the van der Waals envelope of the neutral ion, and ΔGstd⊖ = 7.95 kJ·mol–1 is the standard-state correction, from equal concentrations in the gas and aqueous phase (simulated
situation) to concentrations corresponding to a pressure of 1 bar
in the gas phase and 1 m in the aqueous phase. ΔGcor was calculated according to the correction scheme
for oligoatomic ion hydration for the
case of lattice-sum electrostatic interactions, as outlined in the .

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations of the pentameric protein were performed
using the GROMOS11 molecular simulation package. Parameters from the GROMOS force field 54A7 were used.
The parameters for the oxidized and reduced heme group were taken
from Zou et al. For compound I, an oxygen
atom with GROMOS integer atom code 2 and a partial charge of −0.38e was covalently bound to the Fe ion with a bond length
of 0.161 nm and O–Fe–N angles kept at 90° with
a force constant of 380 kJ·mol–1. The Fe ion
maintained a partial charge of 0.48e, with the remaining
charge distribution spread over the atoms of the porphyrin system
by analogy to charge distributions from density functional calculations,
kindly provided to us by Lars Olsen of the University of Copenhagen.
Building blocks for all heme species are available in the .

The protein was
solvated in simple point charge (SPC) water molecules in a periodic rectangular simulation box to which chloride
and sodium ions were added to obtain an overall neutral system at
pH 7. The temperature of the systems was slowly increased to 300 K
by 60 K every 20 ps and further equilibrated for 100 ps. A step size
of 2 fs was used, and the coordinates were written out every 0.5 ps.
A weak coupling with a relaxation time of 0.1 ps for the temperature
and 0.5 ps for the pressure was used to keep the temperature and pressure
constant at 300 K and 1 atm, respectively. The isothermal compressibility was
set to 4.575 × 10–4 (kJ·mol–1·nm–3)−1. The SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain the bond lengths to their
optimal values with a relative geometric accuracy of 10–4. A molecular pairlist was generated using a triple-range cutoff. Nonbonded interactions up to a short range of
0.8 nm were calculated at every time step from a pairlist that was
updated every five steps. Interactions up to a long-range cutoff of
1.4 nm were calculated at pairlist updates and kept constant in between.
A reaction-field contribution was added
to the electrostatic interactions and forces to account for a homogeneous
medium with a dielectric permittivity of 61 outside the cutoff. A rototranslational constraint was used to prevent
the protein from rotating in the rectangular box. A summary of all performed simulations is given in Table .

Analysis
The GROMOS++ software package was used to analyze the simulations. The atom-positional
root-mean-square deviations of the backbone atoms from the initial
model structures and the secondary structure according to the DSSP
rules defined by Kabsch and Sander were
calculated to assess the stability of the protein. Hydrogen bonds
were monitored based on the criterion that a hydrogen atom connected
to a donor atom has an acceptor atom within 0.25 nm and the donor–hydrogen–acceptor
angle is at least 135°.

Results
Parametrization
The derivation of experimental reference values for the free energy
of hydration is summarized in Table S1 (). Table  compares these
data to the results from the simulations. The simulation data is calculated
as the sum of a free energy of cavitation, a raw charging free energy,
various corrections to account for artifacts in the treatment of electrostatic
interactions, and a standard state correction (see Table S2, ). When the absolute intrinsic
hydration free energy (ΔsG⊖) of the parametrization is compared with those calculated from the
experimental values (Table ), the achieved
absolute intrinsic hydration free energy (ΔsG⊖) from the parametrization is within
an acceptable range of the experimental value and should render the
ions compatible with the 54A7 and 54A8 GROMOS parameter sets., The final interaction parameters are available from Table . Note that in the 54A8 parameter set, the charged
groups of the protein have been parametrized accordingly, while this
is not the case for the 54A7 parameter set.

Overall Protein Structure
After parametrization of the ions, a total of 12 simulations were
performed with the pentameric chlorite dismutase from Candidatus
Nitrospira defluvii (NdCld, PDB id 3nn1) and its R173A mutant (PDB id 3nn3) (Table ). In order to assess the stability of the protein
during the simulations and investigate possible structural changes,
several analyses were performed on the last 10 ns of the simulations.
The average values of various properties over the simulation and over
the five monomers are presented in Table .

The first column
shows the label of the simulation. The second column shows the root
mean square deviation (RMSD) with respect to the crystal structure.
The third column shows the amount of helices and sheets over the course
of the simulations. The values for the crystal structures are 43.9%
helices and 25.5% sheets for the wild-type structure and 44.3% helices
and 24.7% sheets for the R173A mutant structure. The fourth column
shows the amount of hydrogen bonds between the monomers. All values
are averages over the last 10 ns of the simulation and over the five
monomers with statistical uncertainties obtained from block averaging.

The
atom-positional root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) with respect to
the crystal structures 3nn1 and 3nn3 was in the range between 0.16 and 0.19 nm with a statistical uncertainty
of 0.01–0.03 nm. No significant deviations from the crystal
structure were observed. Moreover, the rmsd of the mutant is comparable
to wild-type NdCld. Secondary structure elements over time were analyzed
using the DSSP algorithm. The predominant α-helical structure
(Figure ) did not change significantly during
the simulations. The percentage of amino acids that are part of a
helix over 10 ns of simulations over all five monomers ranges from
42.0% to 43.5% with a statistical uncertainty of 0.5% to 1.5% determined
via block averaging. In the crystal structures
of wild-type NdCld and the variant R173A 43.9% and 44.3% of the amino
acids are part of α-helical structures. The major helices did
not unfold during the various simulations. Furthermore, the β-sheet
structures at the center of each monomer were analyzed. The percentage
of amino acids that are part of a β-sheet structure over the
simulation time over all five monomers was found to range from 22.4%
to 23.8% with a statistical uncertainty of 0.5% to 2.8%. This compares
with 25.5% and 24.7% found in the crystal structures of the wild-type
and mutant proteins. The absence of significant changes of secondary
structure elements, as well as the low rmsd values for all simulations
clearly suggest that the monomers of NdCld are very stable during
the simulations.

are colored differently, and the secondary structure elements are
shown in a cartoon representation, while the side chains are shown
as sticks. The heme is also shown with a stick representation, and
the substrate ions in the active sites are shown with a bubble representation.

Next we assessed the stability
of the quaternary structure of NdCld by monitoring the number of hydrogen
bonds between the monomers over time. The average number of hydrogen
bonds over the last 10 ns of simulation over five interfaces ranges
from 9.4 to 12.2 with a statistical uncertainty of 0.7 to 3.0 hydrogen
bonds. This indicates that the monomers interact stably and the pentamer
does not lose its quaternary structure over the course of the simulations.

Cyanide and Chlorite Binding to Ferrous and Ferric NdCld
The stability assessments described above clearly suggest that the
overall structure of NdCld does not change during the 12 20-ns simulations.
This concurs with the literature that heme enzymes do not undergo
big structural changes during redox catalysis in general− thus allowing us to study the impact of the oxidation state of NdCld
and the presence of various anions on the behavior of the fully conserved
Arg173. The latter was shown to participate in the chlorite degradation
mechanism,, and to adopt
two distinct conformations, one pointing toward the heme iron (here
referred to as “in”) and one pointing toward the entry
of the active site substrate access channel (here referred to as “out”).
This prompted us to study the change in distance between the Cζ
atom of Arg173 and the heme iron over the course of the simulations
in all five monomers (Figure  and Table ).

Normalized distributions of the distance between the heme
iron and the Cζ atom of R173. The position of R173 is either
“in”, pointing toward the heme iron, or “out”
pointing toward the substrate channel entry. The arginine was considered
as “in” when then heme iron arginine distance was 0.64
nm or less. This threshold is represented by a vertical black bar
in all graphs. Tile A shows the simulation with compound I, hypochlorite,
and the arginine starting from an “out” position (CC).
Tile B shows the simulation with compound I, hypochlorite, and the
arginine starting from an “in” position (CI). Tiles
C, E, and G show the simulations with ferric NdCld heme and chlorite,
cyanide, and no ion, respectively (OC, ON, OX). Tiles D, F, and H
show the simulations with ferrous NdCld heme and chlorite, cyanide,
and no ion, respectively (RC, RN, RX). Tiles I and J show the simulations
with 20 chlorite ions free in solution with the ferric and ferrous
NdCld, respectively (OF, RF).

The first column shows the label of the simulation. The
second column shows the percentage of the simulation time arginine
173 was in either the “in” position, pointing towards
the heme iron or the “out” position pointing towards
the substrate channel entry. The arginine was considered as “in”
when then heme iron to arginine Cζ distance was 0.64 nm (corresponding
to a minimum in distributions of Figure )
or less. The third colum shows the percentage of the simulation time
that the substrate ion was inside or outside one of the active sites
of the pentamer. The ion was considered in the active site with a
heme iron to ion distance of 0.8 nm (corresponding to the initial
distances in simulations CC and CI, where the ions are furthest from
the heme iron) or less. The fourth column shows the average electrostatic
potential at the heme iron.

In the resting ferric state, R173 stayed in the “out”
conformation as long as anions were absent in the initial protein
structure (Figure G, simulation OX) or anions
(e.g., chlorite) were free in solution (Figure I, simulation OF). In contrast, in ferrous NdCld R173 can adopt both
positions (Figure H, simulation RX) with 38%
in the “in” position and 62% in the “out”
position (Table ). Because the simulation
was started with the arginine in the “out” position,
transitions between the two conformations occurred during the 20 ns
simulation. This indicates that the ferrous heme attracts the positively
charged arginine at a distance within the cutoff chosen for the simulations
(1.4 nm), in line with the average electrostatic potential calculated
at the heme iron (Table ). In the presence
of chlorite in the solution (Figure J, simulation
RF), R173 mainly adopted the “out” position (i.e., 4%
“in” and 96% “out”) most probably due
to chlorite ions that came close to the active site.

With ferric
NdCld and a cyanide ion (i.e., a low-spin ligand in heme proteins)
in the active site and starting with R173 in the “out”
position (simulation ON), during 85% of the simulation time, the arginine
was in the “in” position. Apparently, the negatively
charged cyanide ion represents a strong attractive force, which is
also shown by on average 1.1 hydrogen bonds formed between the cyanide
ion and R173. With ferrous NdCld and CN– in the
heme cavity (simulation RN), the “in” conformation was
adopted only during 11% of the simulation time, most probably because
the anion left the active site after a short period of time.

Next we placed the substrate chlorite in the heme cavity of either
ferric or ferrous NdCld (Figure C,D, simulations
OC and RC). In both cases, the amount of time that Arg173 spent in
each position was similar (39% and 30% “in” versus 61%
and 70% “out”, respectively). However, the distance
distribution with ferric NdCld showed two distinct peaks, whereas
in the reduced protein three smaller and wider peaks were found, which
might reflect substrate leaving the active site. The fact that with
cyanide the arginine conformation is more balanced toward the “in”
position could be due to the higher density of negative charges, while
in the chlorite ion these are more delocalized over the atoms (Table ). The higher attraction toward R173 of the cyanide
versus the chlorite is also shown by only 0.6 hydrogen bonds between
R173 and the chlorite, as opposed to 1.1 hydrogen bonds with cyanide.
Note that as there are only a low number (between 4 and 5 over 20
ns) of reversible transitions observed, the percentages of the arginine
positions are indications only.

Figure  depicts the distribution of the distance between the heme iron and
the anions, whereas Table  summarizes the
respective fraction being either in the heme cavity or outside. With
ferric NdCld, both cyanide and chlorite remained close to the heme
iron for 100% of the simulation time (Figure E,G, simulations OC and ON). In comparison, in the ferrous state,
cyanide spent only 11% and chlorite 30% of the time in the active
site. Figure F,H (simulations RC and RN) show
that some ions moved as far as into the bulk water.

Normalized distributions
of the position of the substrate ion. The substrate ion was considered
inside the active site when the distance between the substrate ion
and the heme iron was 0.8 nm or less. This threshold is shown by a
vertical black bar in all graphs. Tiles A and B show the simulations
with the R173A mutant structure and compound I and hypochlorite (MC)
and ferric state and chlorite (MO), respectively. Tiles C and D show
the simulations with compound I and hypochlorite with the conserved
arginine 173 pointing toward the substrate channel entry (CC) or toward
the heme iron (CI), respectively. Tiles E and G show the simulations
with Fe(III) state and chlorite (OC) and cyanide (ON), respectively.
Tiles F and H show the simulations with Fe(II) state and chlorite
(RC) and cyanide (RN), respectively. Tiles I and J show the simulations
with chlorite ions free in solution and ferric (OF) and ferrous (RF)
NdCld, respectively.

In two simulations (OF and RF), 20 chlorite ions were added
to the water box. As can be seen in Figure I, some ions moved into the active site of the ferric protein. An
ion is considered inside the active site if the heme iron to ion distance
is lower than 0.8 nm, which corresponds to the initial distances in
simulations CC and CI, where the ions are furthest from the heme iron.
In contrast, this did not occur in ferrous NdCld (Figure J). With ferrous NdCld, several chlorite ions came
close to an active site, as shown in Figure B for the five ions that come closest to the 0.8 cutoff. However,
these never entered the active site. In contrast, in ferric pentameric
NdCld, four of the five active sites had chlorite close to the heme
cavity during a large part of the simulation time, as shown in Figure A by the various curves. Two active sites completely
bound a chlorite ion, which stayed in the active site for the rest
of the simulation, depicted by the red and black lines in Figure A, which are significantly below the 0.8 nm cutoff.
During the simulations, the active site was solvated, and no sodium
or chlorite counterions were seen to enter the active site. Figure  demonstrates that the position of bound chlorite
in this simulation (OF) was similar to the position in simulation
OC, in which the substrate was in the active site from the beginning.
During the simulations, no evidence was found that arginine mediates
the shuttling of the ion to the active site. In contrast, Arg173 follows
an anion that occupies the active site and adopts the “in”
position only some time after the ion is already in the active site.
In summary, spontaneous binding of the anionic substrate occurred
during the 20 ns simulations of the ferric NdCld, and anions bind
tightly to the cavity, regardless of their character or the presence
of Arg173. These findings clearly suggest that chlorite is attracted
by the ferric heme state and that the role of Arg173 in the substrate
binding process is negligible.

Distance between the substrate ions and
the heme iron over the course of the simulations. The horizontal black
line at 0.8 nm represents the threshold for considering an ion as
being inside the active site or outside. Tile A shows the simulation
with 20 chlorites free in solution and ferric NdclD (OF). Tile B shows
the simulation with 20 chlorites free in solution and ferrous NdCld
(RF). Tiles C and D show the simulations with compound I and hypochlorite
and the conserved arginine 173 pointing toward the heme iron (CI)
and toward the substrate channel entry (CC), respectively. For clarity,
only curves for ions that show spontaneous binding are drawn in different
colors. When two curves with matching colors are given, these are
representative of a single ion interacting with multiple active sites.

chlorite dismutase from Candidatus Nitrospira defluvii (NdCld) in the crystal structure with a chlorite bound (in blue)
and after spontaneous binding during the simulation with 20 chlorite
ions free in solution and an oxidized heme iron (in red). The R173
is pointing toward the substrate channel entry in both cases.

Hypochlorite Binding to Compound I
Hypochlorite has been postulated to be a transiently formed intermediate
during the degradation of chlorite that reacts with compound I to
form chloride and O2. Simulating compound I and hypochlorite
in the free solution showed that Arg173 adopts the “out”
position almost exclusively (Figure A) regardless
of its starting position.

Next we evaluated the distribution
of the distance between the heme iron in the compound I state and
hypochlorite with R173 either in the “in” or in the
“out” conformation. In both simulations, most of the
anions left the active site during the simulation (Figure C,D, simulations CC and CI, Table ). Only 7% or 8% of the simulation time, ClO– was found in the heme cavity. This suggests that this transiently
formed intermediate (in contrast to the substrate chlorite) easily
escapes from the heme cavity and that the starting conformation of
R173 does not matter for the hypochlorite retention.

Simulation
of the mutant structure (R173A) with hypochlorite in the active site
gave a similar picture. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, ClO– spent only 2% of the simulation time in the heme cavity.
The difference between wild-type and mutant protein is relatively
small. However, it should be noted that in the wild-type enzyme the
substrate ions stay significantly longer in the vicinity of the active
site than in the mutant. By increasing the cutoff for being inside
the active from 0.8 to 1.5, corresponding to the length of the substrate
entry channel, we observed that hypochlorite ions stay 66% of the
simulation time close to the active site, with only two ions leaving
into the bulk water. In the mutant, the retention of ions was only
observed for 29% of the time, with all ions in bulk water after 12
ns. It was previously suggested that
Arg173 helps to keep hypochlorite in the reaction sphere for the rebound
mechanism. It has to be mentioned that in MD simulations using a classical
force field description, no reaction can take place and a small difference
in the residence time of hypochlorite may be sufficient to explain
differences in the leaking behavior. Moreover, because a reaction
could take place relatively quickly, it is impossible to quantitatively
compare experimentally observed leaking rates to the ones observed
in our simulations.

During the simulation of compound I with
hypochlorite (CC and CI), most of the ions left the active site. But
it was also observed that in some cases a hypochlorite ion returned
to positions close to the active site, that is with a heme iron to
ion distance lower than 0.8 nm, independent whether Arg173 was initially
in the “in” or “out” position (Figure C,D). Analysis revealed that it was not the same
hypochlorite that had left the active site previously. This can be
seen following the black and gray curves in the Figure C,D. The lines represent the heme iron to ion distance of
a hypochlorite ion during the simulation. The black line in tiles
C and D of Figure  shows that the hypochlorite
represented by that line is close to a heme iron at the beginning
of the simulations but leaves during the simulations. The distance
between the same ion and another active site is represented by the
gray line in tiles C and D of Figure , and
it can be seen that the ion moves closely to the heme iron.

Discussion
The pentameric chlorite dismutase from Candidatus Nitrospira
defluvii in its ferrous, ferric, and compound I states was
simulated in the presence of its substrate chlorite, the postulated
intermediate hypochlorite, and the low-spin ligand cyanide in order
to evaluate the role of the conserved distal arginine in these events.
In functional Clds, Arg173 (NdCld numbering) represents the only charged
amino acid in the heme cavity.

In Figure , we summarize the MD simulation data from this work and present
a reaction mechanism that also incorporates the available experimental
data. The initial reaction includes binding of the anionic substrate
chlorite to the ferric resting state of NdClds forming the corresponding
complex. Experimental data have shown that the role of Arg173 in this
reaction is marginal. Exchange of R173 by either alanine or glutamine
had only a small effect on the KM value
(i.e., increase by a factor of 1.3 in R173A compared with the wild-type
protein). This is supported by the MD
data, which showed that Arg173 does not play a role in shuttling the
anion into the active site. It rather followed the charged molecules
and changed its orientation (“in” versus “out”)
accordingly. Note that in the 54A7 force field, the intrinsic absolute
free energy of hydration for the guanidinium ion is underestimated
by ∼15 kJ·mol–1, potentially influencing the detailed equilibrium between
the “in” and the “out” conformations.
This might suggest that the role of Arg173 in this initial reaction
step is substrate recognition, since no spontaneous binding events
were observed in the simulation of the mutant Arg173Ala and hypochlorite
leaking from the active site (simulation MC). In contrast, in both
simulations with the wild-type NdCld and hypochlorite, some substrate
ions returned to an active site after having left the protein (simulations
CI and CC and Figure ). This was also the
case with both ferrous and ferric wild-type NdCld where some chlorite
ions came close to the active site (simulations OF and RF, Figure ). To confirm that R173 is relevant for substrate
recognition, an additional simulation was run of the mutant in the
ferric state with 20 chlorite ions randomly placed in the simulation
box (cf. simulations OF and RF). No chlorite binding was observed
in this simulation. Real binding was only observed with the ferric
protein, which represents the resting state of chlorite dismutase,
and with hypochlorite to the compound I state of the enzyme. The Fe(II)
state does not participate in catalysis.

Proposed reaction cycle
for chlorite dismutases. First (I) the substrate ClO2– binds to ferric NdCld forming the Fe(III)–ClO2 adduct. R173 possibly plays a role in the initial recognition
but is not crucial for the binding. This reaction is followed by oxidation
(II) of the heme to compound I with concomitant reduction of chlorite
to hypochlorite, ClO–. Subsequently, (III) hypochlorite
might escape the active site, which is hampered by R173, or (IV) the
ferryl oxygen of compound I is rebound by hypochlorite, and (V) chloride
and dioxygen are released.

Binding of cyanide to the active site of heme proteins
typically occurs with the respective ferric forms. The low-spin cyanide
complexes of the corresponding Fe(II) forms are weak. Recent experimental
data have demonstrated that both the binding
rate of cyanide to ferric NdCld and the stability of the low-spin
complex was extremely low in NdCld mutants that lacked Arg173. The
present MD study shows that cyanide remained in the heme cavity of
wild-type ferric NdCld during simulation and promoted the “in”
conformation of Arg173. With ferrous NdCld, cyanide easily escaped
from the active site, and the “out” conformation of
Arg173 prevailed.

Immediately after binding of the substrate
chlorite to ferric NdCld, the heterolytic cleavage of chlorite occurs
thereby oxidizing the enzyme to the compound I state and reducing
chlorite to hypochlorite (Figure ). This transient
intermediate must stay in the reaction sphere for the subsequent recombination
step. The turnover number (kcat) for chlorite
degradation in the mutant is ∼6.5% (R173A) compared with the wild-type enzyme. This underlines the
importance of Arg173 in these reaction steps but also demonstrates
that it is not fully essential for catalysis. Besides the decreased
turnover number, the variant Arg173Ala was shown to be also more prone
to inactivation than the wild-type enzyme.

The MD simulations
of compound I with hypochlorite confirm that the conserved arginine
173 might play a role as already suggested, and
that it is important to keep the transiently formed hypochlorite close
to or in the active site. Recent experimental data suggest that some
hypochlorite nevertheless escapes from the active site in a pH-dependent
manner. As a consequence, the enzyme becomes irreversibly inactivated
by oxidative modifications of both the protein matrix and the prosthetic
group. Escape of hypochlorite is more
pronounced at high chlorite concentrations, as well as with mutant
enzymes that lack Arg173. The present MD study clearly demonstrates
that a large portion of hypochlorite escapes from the heme cavity
and enters the bulk phase. This fits with the experimental data that
reported oxidative modifications of amino acids on the surface of
NdCld that derive from hypochlorite. The
present findings also show that leakage of hypochlorite in the mutant
R173A is higher than that in the wild-type protein although the MD
simulations do not allow a correlation with experimental data since
no recombination reaction can take place.

Chlorite dismutase
is a promising biocatalyst that can be used for the degradation of
anthropogenic chlorite contamination in the environment. For this
purpose, it is necessary to select robust representatives or engineer
the metalloenzymes and decrease their susceptibility for inactivation.
The present study allowed new insights into the dynamics and the role
of the conserved arginine in this process. It will be interesting
to perform comparative studies of clade II dimeric chlorite dismutases,
which are less prone to inactivation (unpublished data) but have a
very similar heme cavity architecture.
