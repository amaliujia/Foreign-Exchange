5-Methylcytosine
is found in all domains of life, but the bacterial
cytosine deaminase from Escherichia coli (CodA) will
not accept 5-methylcytosine as a substrate. Since significant amounts
of 5-methylcytosine are produced in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes,
this compound must eventually be catabolized and the fragments recycled
by enzymes that have yet to be identified. We therefore initiated
a comprehensive phylogenetic screen for enzymes that may be capable
of deaminating 5-methylcytosine to thymine. From a systematic analysis
of sequence homologues of CodA from thousands of bacterial species,
we identified putative cytosine deaminases where a “discriminating”
residue in the active site, corresponding to Asp-314 in CodA from E. coli, was no longer conserved. Representative examples
from Klebsiella pneumoniae (locus tag: Kpn00632), Rhodobacter sphaeroides (locus tag: Rsp0341), and Corynebacterium glutamicum (locus tag: NCgl0075) were demonstrated
to efficiently deaminate 5-methylcytosine to thymine with values of kcat/Km of 1.4 ×
105, 2.9 × 104, and 1.1 × 103 M–1 s–1, respectively. These
three enzymes also catalyze the deamination of 5-fluorocytosine to
5-fluorouracil with values of kcat/Km of 1.2 × 105, 6.8 × 104, and 2.0 × 102 M–1 s–1, respectively. The three-dimensional structure of
Kpn00632 was determined by X-ray diffraction methods with 5-methylcytosine
(PDB id: 4R85), 5-fluorocytosine (PDB id: 4R88), and phosphonocytosine (PDB id: 4R7W) bound in the active
site. When thymine auxotrophs of E. coli express
these enzymes, they are capable of growth in media lacking thymine
when supplemented with 5-methylcytosine. Expression of these enzymes
in E. coli is toxic in the presence of 5-fluorocytosine,
due to the efficient transformation to 5-fluorouracil.

5-Methylcytosine is a modified nucleobase formed by the methylation
of cytosine in DNA. The synthesis of 5-methylcytosine is catalyzed
by DNA methyltransferases, and in animals, plants, and fungi this
modification functions as an epigenetic marker.1−3 In mammals,
methylation occurs predominantly at CpG sites in ∼1% of the
human genome.4 In Escherichia coli and related bacteria, methylation occurs at CC(A/T)GG sites by the
dcm methylase.5 Methylation of cytosine
in the DNA of bacteria is part of the restriction/modification system
and has also been implicated in controlling gene expression during
stationary phase.6 There is no known
direct demethylation reaction to form cytosine from 5-methylcytosine
in DNA. Instead, the methyl group is first hydroxylated and then oxidized
to form 5-carboxycytosine, which is excised from DNA by base excision
repair (Scheme 1).7,8 This
process is initiated by methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) to produce
5-hydroxymethylcytosine.9 Further oxidation
of hydroxymethyl cytosine by TET1 and methylcytosine dioxygenase 2
(TET2) yields 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine, respectively.10

Scheme 1 The deamination of the cytosine
moiety in nucleotides and nucleic
acids is a conserved metabolic step for the recycling of pyrimidines
across all domains of life. This reaction may occur through the deamination
of cytosine,11,12 cytidine,13 cytidine monophosphate,14,15 or cytidine
triphosphate.16,17 Cytidine deaminases from cog0295
are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.18,19 The cytidine deaminases from E. coli and yeast
have been studied in some detail, and the E. coli enzyme has been shown to be catalytically active with both cytidine
and 5-methylcytidine. At least two variants of cytosine deaminase
exist. The yeast cytosine deaminase can deaminate 5-methylcytosine
in addition to cytosine and the active site of this enzyme is similar
to that of cytidine deaminase.12,20 These enzymes are members
of the cytidine deaminase-like superfamily and cog0590. In contrast,
the unrelated bacterial cytosine deaminase (CodA) from E.
coli (locus tag: b0337) will not deaminate 5-methylcytosine
at appreciable rates.21

CodA from E. coli is a member of cog0402 and the
amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS).22,23 Other deaminases
from this Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) include guanine deaminase,24S-adenosylhomocysteine deaminase,25 and 8-oxoguanine deaminase26 among others. The structure of CodA from E. coli has been determined in the absence of bound ligands (PDB id: 1K6W), and also in the
presence of isoguanine (PDB id: 3RN6) and a phosphonate mimic of the transition-state
(PDB id: 3O7U; Figure 1). Substrate binding relies on Gln-156,
which forms a pair of hydrogen bonds with the carboxamide moiety of
the pyrimidine or purine base. Glu-217 participates in substrate recognition
and catalysis by a direct interaction with the amidine moiety of the
substrate (Figure 1B and C). In this active
site, Asp-314 provides an apparent steric boundary for the binding
of cytosine as a substrate, and participates in a hydrogen bond to
N7 of the purine ring for recognition of isoguanine (Figure 1B). CodA can accept pyrimidine (cytosine) and purine
(isoguanine) substrates but the active site is apparently not configured
to deaminate structurally related compounds such as 5-methylcytosine
and 5-fluorocytosine.21,27

Residues involved in the binding of the divalent cation in the active

superfamily (PDB id: 1K6W). (B) Mode of binding of isoguanine in the active site of CodA (PDB

Since significant amounts of 5-methylcytosine
are produced in both
prokaryotes and eukaryotes, this compound must eventually be catabolized
and the fragments recycled. We therefore initiated a search for enzymes
of unknown function related to the bacterial cytosine deaminase with
the catalytic ability to deaminate 5-methylcytosine. By analyzing
sequence homologues of CodA from thousands of bacterial species, we
identified groups of putative cytosine deaminases where the “discriminating”
residue corresponding to Asp-314 in CodA from E. coli was no longer conserved. Representative examples of these enzymes
were purified and found to efficiently deaminate cytosine, 5-methylcytosine,
and 5-fluorocytosine. Expression of this enzyme in thymine auxotrophs
of E. coli rescued growth in the presence of 5-methylcytosine.
Expression of this enzyme was toxic in the presence of 5-fluorocytosine
in strains of E. coli that also expressed uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase.

Materials and Methods
E. coli Cell Lines
Two gene knockout
strains of E. coli were obtained from the Coli Genetic
Stock Center (CGSC) at Yale University. Both cell lines lack the genes
for the metabolism of arabinose, allowing the use of arabinose-inducible
plasmids. The pyrimidine auxotroph (CGSC-9145) lacks the gene for
orotidine-5-phosphate decarboxylase (F–, Δ(araD-araB)567, ΔlacZ4787(::rrnB-3),
λ–, ΔpyrF789::kan, rph-1, Δ(rhaD-rhaB)568, hsdR514).28 This cell line expresses
pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase and will convert added pyrimidine
nucleotides to their monophosphorylated counterparts, including 5-fluorocytosine
and 5-fluorouracil. The thymine auxotroph (CGSC-4091) lacks the gene
for thymidylate synthetase (F-, araBAD-1?, tsx-77, thyA40, deoB15).

Cloning and Purification of Kpn00632, Rsp0371, NCgl0075, and
CodA
The genes for Kpn00632 from Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (gi|152969203), Rsp0371 from Rhodobacter
sphaeroides 2.4.1 (gi|77463913), and NCgl0075 from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032 (gi|19551325) were
cloned into pET28 with a C-terminal His6-tag using standard
cloning practices. The plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL-21 DE3 cells and plated onto LB-agarose containing 50 μg/mL
kanamycin. Cultures of 1 L (LB broth, kanamycin 50 μg/mL) were
inoculated with the resulting colonies and grown at 37 °C until
the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression was
induced with 1.0 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside,
and the cultures were shaken for 20 h at 25 °C. The cultures
were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min, and the isolated cell pellets
disrupted by sonication in 35 mL of buffer A (20 mM HEPES, 250 mM
NaCl, 250 mM NH4SO4, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5)
containing 2.5 mg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). DNA was
removed by dropwise addition of 100 mg of protamine sulfate dissolved
in 15 mL of buffer A. Proteins with a His6-tag were loaded
onto a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Heathcare) with running buffer A and
eluted with a linear gradient of elution buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 250
mM NaCl, 250 mM NH4SO4, 500 mM imidazole, pH
7.5).

The gene for cytosine deaminase (CodA, b0337) from E. coli K12 (gi|16128322) was cloned into pBAD322C without
purification tags.29E. coli cells lacking arabinose metabolizing genes (CGSC 9145) were transformed
with the plasmid and plated onto LB-agarose containing 25 μg/mL
chloramphenicol. A 1 L culture (LB broth, chloramphenicol 25 μg/mL)
was inoculated from the resulting colonies and grown at 37 °C
until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.6. Protein expression
was induced with 1.0 mM l-arabinose, and the culture was
shaken for 20 h at 25 °C. The sample was centrifuged at 7000
rpm for 15 min and the cell pellet was disrupted by sonication in
35 mL of running buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) and 2.5 mg of PMSF.
DNA was removed by the dropwise addition of 100 mg protamine sulfate
dissolved in 15 mL of running buffer. The protein was precipitated
with 70% saturated NH4SO4, and the pellet resuspended
in 4.0 mL of running buffer. The protein solution was loaded onto
a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 gel filtration column. Fractions containing
active enzyme were pooled and concentrated.

Cloning of Enzymes for
in Vivo Assays
The genes for
Kpn00632 and Rsp0341 were cloned into pBAD322C using standard cloning
practices without purification tags. The D314A mutant of cytosine
deaminase from E. coli was constructed by standard
site directed mutagenesis methods using primer overlap extension from
the pBAD322c-b0337 plasmid with the primers 5′-CGTCTGCTTTGGTCACGATGCTGTCTTCGATCCGTGGTATCC-3′
and 5′- GGATACCACGGATCGAAGACAGCATCGTGACCAAAGCAGACG-3′.30

Activity Screening and Determination of Kinetic
Constants
Purified enzyme was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH
7.5, at 25 °C
for 1 h in a 96-well UV–vis quartz plate with a small library
of potential substrates (Scheme 2). The spectra
were monitored as a function of time from 240 to 350 nm. The substrate
library included cytosine (1), 5-methylcytosine (2), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (3), 5-fluorocytosine
(4), 5-aminocytosine (5), creatinine (6), isoguanine (7), cytosine-5-carboxylate (8), N-methylcytosine (9), and
5-formylcytosine (10). Initial reaction velocities were
measured by a direct UV–vis assay in a 96-well quartz plate
using various enzyme/substrate combinations in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5
at 30 °C. Product formation was monitored at the following wavelengths
using experimentally derived differential molar extinction coefficients
for the following substrates: cytosine (255 nm, Δε = 2600
M–1 cm–1), 5-methylcytosine (262
nm, Δε = 3700 M–1 cm–1), creatinine (240 nm, Δε = 6100 M–1 cm–1), isoguanine (294 nm, Δε = −6600
M–1 cm–1), 5-fluorocytosine (262
nm, Δε = 3200 M–1 cm–1), 5-aminocytosine (235 nm, Δε = −2000 M–1 cm–1), and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (258 nm, Δε
= 3700 M–1 cm–1). Values of kcat and kcat/Km were determined by fitting the data to eq 1 using SigmaPlot 11, where v is
the initial velocity, Et is enzyme concentration,
and A is the substrate concentration. 1  

Scheme 2 Selection Medium for in Vivo Experiments
The selection
medium contained M9 minimal salts, 1.96 g/L yeast synthetic dropout
medium without uracil, 0.1% glycerol, 100 μM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgSO4, and trace elements. The 5000x mixture
of trace elements was prepared with 95 mL of H2O, 5.0 g
of citric acid, 5.0 g of ZnSO4·(7 H2O),
4.75 g of FeSO4·(7 H2O), 1.0 g of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·(6 H2O), 250 mg of CuSO4·(H2O), and 50 mg each
of MnSO4·(H2O) and Na2MoO4·(2H2O). Yeast synthetic dropout medium with
glycerol (and cytosine when supplemented) was autoclaved separately
from the M9 medium. CaCl2 and MgSO4 were sterile
filtered and the mixture of trace elements was autoclaved before all
components were combined.

Determination of in Vivo 5-Methylcytosine
Deaminase Activity
The thymine auxotroph of E. coli was transformed
with pBAD322C and the plasmids containing cytosine deaminase from E. coli, Kpn00326, and Rsp0341. These cells were plated
onto LB-agar with chloramphenicol (25 μg/mL) supplemented with
200 μM thymine. Single colonies were picked, and 5 mL cultures
of LB containing 100 μM thymine and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol
were grown for 14 h overnight. Cultures of selection medium (25 mL)
containing 100 μM MnSO4, 100 μM zinc acetate,
and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol were prepared in 100 mL flasks
with the following experimental conditions: (a) 400 μM 5-fluorocystosine
(b) 100 μM arabinose, (c) 100 μM thymine and 100 μM
arabinose, (d) 100 μM 5-methylcytosine and 100 μM arabinose,
and (e) 500 μM 5-methylcytosine and 100 μM arabinose.
The cultures were inoculated with 25 μL from the overnight cultures
and shaken at 200 rpm for 12 h at 37 °C. The absorbance at 600
nm was measured every 2 h.

Determination of in Vivo 5-Fluorocytosine
Deaminase Activity
The E. coli pyrimidine
auxotroph was transformed
with pBAD322C and the plasmids containing the genes for cytosine deaminase
(CodA, b0337), Kpn00326, and the D314A mutant of cytosine deaminase
from E. coli. Cells were grown on LB-agar plates
in the presence of 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Single colonies
were picked and overnight cultures (5 mL) were grown in selection
medium containing 150 μM cytosine, 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol,
100 μM MnSO4, and 100 μM zinc acetate in 100
mL flasks prepared with the following experimental conditions: (a)
100 μM arabinose, (b) 50 μM 5-fluorocytosine and 100 μM
arabinose (c) 500 μM 5-fluorocytosine and 100 μM arabinose,
(d) 5.0 μM 5-fluorouracil and 100 μM arabinose. The cultures
were inoculated with 25 μL of the overnight cultures and shaken
at 200 rpm for 12 h at 37 °C. The absorbance at 600 nm was measured
every 2 h.

Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystals of Kpn00632
from Klebsiella pneumoniae liganded with Fe2+ and 5-methylcytosine were grown by the sitting drop method at room
temperature. The protein solution contained Kpn00632 (18.6 mg/mL)
in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM imidazole, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM ammonium
sulfate, 1.0 mM FeCl2, and 40 mM 5-methylcytosine. The
precipitant contained 20% PEG 3350, 0.15 M malic acid (pH 7.0) and
1.0 mM FeCl2. Crystals appeared in 2 weeks and exhibited
diffraction consistent with the space group P21, with six
polypeptides per asymmetric unit. Crystals of Kpn00632 liganded with
Fe2+ and 5-fluorocytosine were also grown by the sitting
drop method at room temperature. The protein solution contained enzyme
(18.6 mg/mL) in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mM imidazole, 250 mM NaCl,
250 mM ammonium sulfate, 1.0 mM FeCl2, and 60 mM 5-fluorocytosine;
the precipitant contained 30% PEG 3350, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.6),
0.2 M ammonium acetate, and 1.0 mM FeCl2. Crystals appeared
in 5 days and exhibited diffraction consistent with the space group P212121, with six polypeptides
per asymmetric unit. Crystals of Kpn00632 liganded with Fe2+ and phosphonocytosine21 were grown by
the sitting drop method at room temperature. The protein solution
contained enzyme (15 mg/mL) in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.0 mM FeCl2, and 10 mM phosphonocytosine. The precipitant contained 20%
PEG 3350, 0.15 M malic acid (pH 7.0), and 1.0 mM FeCl2.
Crystals appeared in 2 days and exhibited diffraction consistent with
the space group P212121, with six polypeptides per asymmetric unit.

Prior to
data collection, crystals of the three forms of Kpn00632 were transferred
to cryoprotectant solutions composed of their mother liquids supplemented
with 20% glycerol, and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream. Three X-ray
diffraction data sets were collected at the NSLS X29A beamline (Brookhaven
National Laboratory) on the 315Q CCD detector. Diffraction intensities
were integrated and scaled with programs DENZO and SCALEPACK.31 The data collection statistics are given in
Table 1.

Structure Determination and Model Refinement
The three
Kpn00632 structures were determined by molecular replacement with
BALBES,32 using only input diffraction
and sequence data. BALBES used the structure of cytosine deaminase
from E. coli complexed with phosphonocytosine (PDB
id: 3O7U) as
the search model. Partially refined structures of the three Kpn00632
crystal forms were generated by BALBES. Subsequent iterative cycles
of refinement were performed for each crystal form including model
rebuilding with COOT,33 refinement with
PHENIX,34 and automatic model rebuilding
with ARP.35 The quality of the final structures
was verified with omit maps. The stereochemistry was checked with
WHATCHECK36 and MOLPOBITY.37 Program LSQKAB38 was used for
structural superposition. Figures with electron density maps were
prepared using PYMOL.39 The final model
of the monoclinic crystal form of Kpn00632 with 5-methylcytosine contains
residues 1–411 of the enzyme in all six polypeptides located
in the asymmetric unit. The C-terminal His-tag residues are not included
in the final model. The ferrous ion and ligand are well-defined in
the active site of every monomer.

The final models of the two
orthorhombic crystal forms of Kpn00632 with 5-fluorocytosine and phosphonocytosine
in the active site contain residues 1–412 of the enzyme in
all six polypeptides of these crystal forms. The C-terminal His-tag
residues have weak electron density and are not included in the final
models. The ferrous ions and the corresponding ligand molecules are
well-defined and bound in the active sites of the corresponding structures.
The final crystallographic refinement statistics for all three structures
of Kpn00632 are provided in Table 1.

Results
Phylogeny
of the Cytosine Deaminase Group from cog0402
A BLAST search
using the sequence of cytosine deaminase from E. coli (b0337, CodA) was submitted, and 1377 sequence homologues
were identified. An all-by-all BLAST was subsequently performed with
these protein sequences to create a sequence similarity network (SSN)
at an E-value stringency of 10–140.40,41 At this level of protein sequence identity,
three major subgroups and a number of minor subgroups could be identified
as illustrated in Figure 2 and four representative
proteins, one from each major cluster and one from a single minor
cluster, were selected for functional characterization. These proteins
included cystosine deaminase (CodA, b0337) from E. coli (subgroup-a); Kpn00632 from Klebsiella
pneumonia (subgroup-b); Rsp0341 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1 (subgroup-c); and NCgl0075 from Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC
13032 (subgroup-d). The sequence identity between
any two proteins ranged from 35% (Rsp0341 and NCgl0075) to 58% (CodA
and Kpn00632).

a BLAST E-value cutoff of 10–140. Groups are labeled by their representative purified protein: (a) CodA (b0337); (b) Kpn00632; (c) Rsp0341; and (d) NCgl0057.

An amino acid sequence alignment of the proteins
contained within
each of the four groups of proteins selected for this investigation
identified a striking difference in the amino acid residue that immediately
follows the critical aspartate residue at the C-terminal end of β-strand
8. In the amidohydrolase superfamily (AHS) of enzymes, this invariant
aspartate residue (Asp-313 in E. coli CodA) coordinates
one of the divalent cations in the active site and functions in proton
transfer reactions.21 In subgroup-a, the residue that follows the invariant aspartate is also
an aspartate, whereas in subgroups-b, -c, and -d this residue is a serine, cysteine, and
serine, respectively (Figure 3).

presented in Figures 1, 4, and 5 are highlighted.

Enzymatic Characterization
The genes for the four enzyme
targets were cloned and expressed in E. coli, and
the proteins purified to homogeneity. The kinetic constants for the
purified proteins with a series of 10 potential substrates were determined
at pH 7.5 and the results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The prototypical cytosine deaminase
from E. coli (CodA, b0337) was able to deaminate
cytosine (1) and isoguanine (7) at appreciable
rates (kcat/Km = 8.4 × 104 and 1.1 × 105 M–1 s–1, respectively), whereas the
ability to deaminate 5-methylcytosine (2) was barely
detectable (kcat/Km = 2.2 × 101 M–1 s–1). Kpn00632 deaminated 5-methylcytosine (2) approximately
4 orders-of-magnitude more efficiently than CodA from E. coli (kcat/Km = 3.3 × 105 M–1 s–1). This enzyme also utilized 5-fluorocytosine (4) and
5-aminocystosine (5) as substrates with kcat/Km values greater than
105 M–1 s–1. Rsp0341
was determined to have a similar catalytic profile as Kpn00632, except
that this enzyme preferentially deaminates cytosine (1) relative to 5-methylcytosine (2). The best substrate
for NCgl0075 was creatinine (kcat/Km = 6.3 × 104 M–1 s–1). The D314A mutant of CodA of E. coli shared a similar substrate profile with Kpn00632, including the
dramatic increase in the catalytic activity using 5-methylcytosine
(kcat/Km =
9.7 × 104 10 M–1 s–1). As previously reported, this enzyme also exhibited a significant
increase in the rate of deamination of 5-fluorocytosine, relative
to the wild-type enzyme (9.9 × 103 M–1 s–1).27

Three-Dimensional Structure
of Kpn00632
The three-dimensional
structure of Kpn00632 was determined in the presence of 5-methylcytosine
(2) (PDB id: 4R85), 5-fluorocytosine (4) (PDB id: 4R88), and phosphonocytosine
(PDB id: 4R7W). In each case, the enzyme adopts a distorted (β/α)8-barrel with a mononuclear metal center at the C-terminal
end of the β-barrel. In the complexes formed with 5-methylcytosine
(Figure 4A), 5-fluorocytosine (Figure 4B), and phosphonocystosine21 (Figure 4C), the metal ion is coordinated
to His-58 and His-60 from the C-terminal end of β-strand 1,
His-209 from the C-terminal end of β-strand 5, and Asp-308 from
the C-terminal end of β-strand 8. In all three structures, the
substrates and inhibitor form a pair of hydrogen bonds between the
carboxamide functional group and the side chain of Gln-151 (Figures 5 A-C). Additionally, Glu-212 interacts with the
—NH=C—NH2 moiety contained within
each of these three ligands.

Rescue of Thymine Auxotrophs with 5-Methylcytosine
Strains
of E. coli that lack thymidylate synthase
cannot grow without the addition of exogenous thymine. These cells
cannot grow in the presence of added 5-methylcytosine, since the wild-type
cytosine deaminase of E. coli lacks the ability to
deaminate 5-methylcytosine to thymine.21 The E. coli thymine auxotroph was transformed with
pBAD322c vectors containing the genes for b0337, Rsp0341, and Kpn00632
to determine whether the expression of enzymes capable of deaminating
5-methylcytosine to thymine was sufficient to enable E. coli to grow in the absence of added thymine. All four examples were
capable of growth when supplemented with 100 μM thymine (Figure 6). However, neither the empty vector nor additional
CodA from E. coli was capable of rescuing growth
when supplemented with 400 μM 5-methylcytosine (Figure 6A and B). Expression of either Kpn00632 or Rsp0341
allowed growth in the presence of 400 μM 5-methylcytosine, and
to a lesser extent in the presence of 100 μM added 5-methylcytosine
for Kpn00632 (Figure 6C and D).

Enhanced Toxicity of 5-Fluorocytosine
The ability of
Kpn00632 and the D314A mutant of CodA of E. coli to
deaminate 5-fluorocytosine to 5-fluorouracil in vivo was tested in
pyrimidine auxotrophs, lacking pyrF. This cell line will phosphoribosylate
exogenous pyrimidines and in the presence of 5-fluorouracil will form
5-fluorouridine monophosphate, a potent inhibitor of thymidylate synthase.
This strain of E. coli cannot grow in the presence
of 5 μM 5-fluorouracil (Figure 7). The
growth rate is not affected by the addition of 50 μM 5-fluorocytosine,
but is measurably reduced in the presence of 500 μM 5-fluorocytosine
(Figure 7A). Overexpression of the wild-type
cytosine deaminase from E. coli in these cells reduces
the growth rate in the presence of 50 and 500 μM 5-fluorocytosine
(Figure 7B) and is reduced even further when
the D314A mutant of CodA is expressed (Figure 7C). Expression of Kpn00632 in these cells completely abolished growth
in the presence of 500 μM added 5-fluorocytosine and severely
inhibited growth in the presence of 50 μM added 5-fluorocytosine
(Figure 7D).

Discussion
The methylation of the
nucleobase cytosine is a common epigenetic modification of DNA in
both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.1,6 However, certain bacterial
enzymes apparently actively exclude this metabolite from the active
site. For example, wild-type cytosine deaminase from E. coli (CodA) catalyzes the deamination of 5-methylcytosine with a value
of kcat/Km of ∼22 M–1 s–1. This
rate constant is more than 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the
value of kcat/Km for the deamination of cytosine (∼105 M–1 s–1) by the same enzyme. Since significant quantities
of 5-methylcytosine are produced in bacterial cells during the modification
of DNA, a metabolic pathway must exist for the catabolism of this
compound. In our search to identify candidate enzymes that would be
capable of deaminating 5-methylcytosine to thymine, we assumed that
these enzymes would be quite similar in structure and sequence to
the cytosine deaminase from E. coli. A similar approach
has previously led to the successful identification of the first enzyme
capable of deaminating 8-oxoguanine to uric acid.26

A search for sequence homologues to CodA from E. coli identified approximately 1400 candidate sequences.
These sequences
cluster into three major groups and numerous minor groups at an E-value
threshold of 10–140 (Figure 2). The genes for three proteins, in addition to CodA from E. coli, were cloned and expressed, and the proteins purified
to homogeneity. Kpn00632 from Klebsiella pneumoniae efficiently catalyzes the deamination of 5-methylcystosine to thymine
with a value of kcat/Km that exceeds 105 M–1 s–1. This rate constant is 4 orders of magnitude greater
than the value of kcat/Km for the deamination of 5-methylcytosine by CodA from E. coli. Similar results were obtained with Rsp0341 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.

The three-dimensional structure
of Kpn00632 was determined in the
presence of 5-methylcytosine, 5-fluorocytosine, and the phosphonate
mimic of the putative tetrahedral intermediate bound in the active
site of the enzyme. In the vicinity of the methyl- and fluoro-substituents
at C5 of the bound ligands, the closest two residues are Glu-273 and
Ser-309. In CodA from E. coli these residues correspond
to Val-278 and Asp-314, respectively. These two residue positions
are highly conserved within each of the three major subgroups identified
in Figure 2. Sequence alignments indicate that
these two residue positions correspond to isoleucine and cysteine
in Rsp0371, and with glutamate and serine in NCgl0075.

Wild-type
CodA from E. coli is essentially unable
to catalyze the deamination of 5-methylcytosine. In Kpn00632, the
residue that follows Asp-308 is a serine. When Asp-314 in E. coli is mutated to alanine, this enzyme is now capable
of deaminating 5-methylcytosine, thus demonstrating that this residue
is largely responsible for the discrimination between 5-methylcytosine
and cytosine in the active site. These changes in the active site
also enable these enzymes to deaminate 5-fluorocytosine to 5-fluorouracil,
a highly toxic metabolite. Similar results have previously been observed
by Mahan et al. when they demonstrated that the D314S mutation in
CodA of E. coli enhanced the turnover ratio of 5-fluorocytosine/cytosine
by 4-fold.27

The addition of Kpn00632
enables the E. coli thymine
auxotroph to grow in the presence of 5-methylcytosine. The thymine
auxotroph cannot produce thymidine, since it lacks thymidylate synthase
and thus has no way to make thymine since wild-type CodA cannot effectively
catalyze the deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine. In the presence
of Kpn00632, these cells can catalyze the formation of thymine from
5-methylcytosine and thymidylate can be made from the phosphoribosyltransferase
reaction (Figure 6). 5-Fluorocytosine is not
normally toxic to E. coli, since wild type CodA cannot
catalyze the formation of 5-fluorouracil.27 5-Fluorouracil is a toxic metabolite that irreversibly inactivates
thymidyldate synthase. When Kpn00632 is expressed in E. coli, 5-fluorocytosine becomes toxic as exhibited by the substantial
retardation of growth (Figure 7).

The
discovery of enzymes capable of deaminating 5-methylcytosine
and 5-fluorocytosine reveals the difficulty of defining the substrate/sequence
boundaries of enzymes based on simple sequence similarity to proteins
of known function. Essentially all of the sequences depicted in the
SSN of Figure 2 have been annotated as cytosine
deaminase. Given the inability of CodA from E. coli to deaminate 5-methylcytosine, these enzymes would have been predicted
to not catalyze the deamination of either 5-methylcytosine or 5-fluorocytosine.
However, a careful examination of the residues that reside in the
active site reveals a significant perturbation of a conserved aspartate
residue to either a serine or cysteine residue.

Full-length
sequence alignments indicate that the subgroups depicted
in Figure 2 are highly specific for the amino
acids that populate the active site. E. coli CodA
is found in subroup-a and most sequences in this
subgroup possess an aspartate residue corresponding to Asp-314. Subgroup-b (including Kpn00632) conserves a serine residue at this
position and is expected to occupy the same role as Ser-309 in Kpn00632.
Subgroup-c and Rsp0341 strongly favor a cysteine
residue at this position. Finally, subgroup-d, previously
characterized as creatinine deaminase, possesses a serine residue
at this position. While 5-methylcytosine is not known to be a metabolite
produced in great quantities for cell proliferation, it seems reasonable
to assume there is an advantage for having an enzyme that can catalyze
the deamination of the free nucleobase. As demonstrated by the in vivo experiment in Figure 6, it
is possible to produce thymine by this route. It remains mysterious
why the cytosine deaminase from E. coli has evolved
to exclude 5-methylcytosine from the active site.

The original
evidence that homologues of CodA from E. coli may
have promiscuous activity for the deamination of 5-methylcytosine
is based on mutagenesis studies that produced a more efficient 5-fluorocytosine
deaminase, with the ultimate goal of transfecting cancer cells with
this enzyme.27 In suicide gene therapy,
the gene for an enzyme capable of deaminating the nontoxic prodrug
5-fluorocytosine is delivered to cancer cells.42 The expressed deaminase subsequently converts 5-fluorocytosine
to 5-fluorouracil, which is ultimately transformed to 5-fluorouridine
monophosphate, an irreversible inhibitor of thymidylate synthase.
DNA replication is ultimately blocked due to the inhibition of deoxythymidine
triphosphate synthesis.

The D314A/S/G mutants created by Mahan
et al. each showed cytotoxicity
in the presence of 5-fluorocytosine in an experiment similar to that
presented in Figure 7.27 However, Kpn0062 deaminates 5-fluorocytosine with a value of kcat/Km that is greater
than that of any of the D314 mutants of CodA reported previously.27 Kpn00632 also deaminates 5-fluorocytosine more
efficiently than it does cytosine. This enzyme may therefore provide
a novel starting point for the creation of even better enzymes for
the deamination of 5-fluorocytosine to 5-fluorouracil.
