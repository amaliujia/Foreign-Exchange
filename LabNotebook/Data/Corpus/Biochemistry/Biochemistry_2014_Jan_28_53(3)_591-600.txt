The amidohydrolase
superfamily
(AHS) is a large group of enzymes that catalyze a remarkably diverse
set of hydrolytic reactions. In general, these enzymatic reactions
are directed at the hydrolysis of amide and ester functional groups
at carbon and phosphorus centers. Structural
and mechanistic studies of the proteins within the AHS have shown
that these enzymes utilize from zero to three divalent metal ions
in the active site.− The catalytic mechanism of hydrolysis utilizes an
activated water/hydroxide for nucleophilic attack at an electrophilic
carbon or phosphorus center. The enzymes in the AHS that possess a
trinuclear metal center in the active site belong to the polymerase
and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) family of proteins and are involved
in the hydrolysis of phosphoesters., The available
crystal structures from the PHP family indicate that these enzymes
possess a distorted (β/α)7-barrel structural
fold, as opposed to the distorted (β/α)8-barrel
fold observed in most of the other members of the AHS.,

The PHP family within the amidohydrolase superfamily is further
subdivided into three Clusters of Orthologous Groups: cog1387, cog0613,
and cog4464. cog4464 consists of protein tyrosine phosphatases, which
have been implicated in the regulation of capsular polysaccharide
assembly in Gram-positive bacteria. Biochemical studies have provided
insights into the structure and catalytically important residues of
these tyrosine phosphatases., cog1387 consists of l-histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HPP), an
enzyme from the l-histidine biosynthetic pathway, and other
related enzymes, including the PHP domain of DNA polymerase X involved
in DNA repair. Structural and mechanistic investigations of HPP enzymes
have revealed the orientation of the substrate with respect to the
metal center in the active site. Further
work has also elucidated the role of the trinuclear active site in
the activation of the nucleophilic hydroxide, and Lewis acid stabilization
of the alcohol product., The mechanistic details obtained
from an improved understanding of the enzymes from cog1387 should
be directly applicable, in principle, to the enzymes belonging to
cog0613. cog0613 consists of PHP family members that have been generically
annotated as metal-dependent phosphoesterases in various online databases
(NCBI and Uniprot). A sequence similarity network (SSN) map at an E value cutoff of 10–60 of 650 nonredundant
protein sequences from cog0613 is presented in Figure ., There are currently three proteins from
cog0613 whose crystal structures have been determined. These include
Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3O0F (locus tag Bad1165 from Bifidobacterium
adolescentis), PDB entry 2ANU (locus tag Tm0559 from Thermotoga
maritima), and PDB entry 3E38 (locus tag Bvu3505 from Bacteroides
vulgatus). The physiological substrates for these enzymes
are unknown, but it has been shown that Bad1165 can hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl phosphate, albeit very slowly, indicating
that it is a phosphoesterase. The crystal structure of this enzyme
has been determined with 5′-adenosine monophosphate (5′-AMP)
bound in the active site, and it has been demonstrated that this enzyme
does not possess DNA polymerase or DNA proofreading activity. The only reported enzymatic function for any
enzyme from cog0613 is that of cyclic phosphate dihydrolase (cPDH)
for Elen0235 from Eggerthella lenta, which hydrolyzes
the cyclic phosphate of 5-phospho-d-ribose 1,2-cyclic phosphate
(PRcP) to d-ribose 5-phosphate and orthophosphate in a nonprocessive
manner through d-ribose 2,5-bisphosphate as an obligatory
reaction intermediate.

Sequence network map
of cog0613 at an E value
cutoff of 10–60 created using Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org). Each node (sphere) represents a protein sequence, while each edge
(line) represents those sequence pairs that are more closely related
than the arbitrary E value cutoff (10–60). The available crystal structures are shown as diamonds, and their
respective PDB entries are given. The enzyme studied in this work,
Cv1693 from C. violaceum ATCC 12472, and its orthologs
are colored blue. Enzyme sequences colored yellow are those that have
been annotated as trpH, while the single orange node represents cyclic
phosphate hydrolase from E. lenta DSM 2243 (Elen0235),
the only other enzymatic reaction known and demonstrated from cog0613.

Our search for new enzymatic functions
in cog0613 focused on the
characterization of proteins of unknown function contained within
the two large groups of proteins (colored yellow and blue) in the
SSN depicted in Figure . Toward that end,
we have purified and determined the three-dimensional crystal structure
of Cv1693 from Chromobacterium violaceum and have
shown that this enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of 3′,5′-adenosine
bisphosphate (pAp) to 5′-AMP and orthophosphate.

and pUp (2′,5′/3′,5′-bisphosphate mixture)
were synthesized according to the method of Barrio et al.

Cloning and Expression
A codon-optimized
synthetic
gene for Cv1693 (gi|34497148) from C. violaceum was inserted into a pET30 variant by ligation-independent cloning
(LIC), utilizing the synthetic gene as a template and 5′-TTAAGAAGGAGATATACCATGGCAAACATTGACCTGCATTTTCATTC-3′ and 5′-GATTGGAAGTAGAGGTTCTCTGCATCAGCCGGACGCAGGATACG-3′
as primers. The resultant protein is
identical to the native protein with the inclusion of a C-terminal
tag (added sequence AENLYFQSHHHHHHWSHPQFEK),
consisting of a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site, a hexahistidine
tag, and a STREP tag. The plasmid was transformed into ROSETTA2(plysS)
and plated on LB agar plates (100 μg/mL kanamycin, 35 μg/mL
chloroamphenicol, and 0.5% glucose). Ten colonies were transferred
to 100 mL of LB (100 μg/mL kanamycin, 35 μg/mL chloroamphenicol,
and 0.5% glucose) and grown overnight at 37 °C. The overnight
culture was added to 4 L of autoinduction medium (25 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM Na2SO4, 25 mM sodium succinate,
2 mM MgSO4, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NZ-AMINE-AS, 0.9% glycerol,
0.45% lactose, and 0.03% glucose) distributed into eight 2 L baffled
flasks. The flasks were shaken (250 rpm)
at 30 °C for 4 h (OD &lt; 3), and the temperature was reduced
to 23 °C for an additional 16 h. The cells were harvested by
centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. To increase the metal
content of the isolated protein, additional expressions that were
supplemented with 150 μM 2,2′-bipyridine, 1.0 mM ZnCl2, and 1.0 mM MnCl2 were performed prior to the
temperature being reduced to 23 °C.

Purification
Thirty
grams of cells were resuspended
in 150 mL of buffer A [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole,
and 10% glycerol] and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified
by centrifugation and applied to a 10 mL Ni-Sepharose HP column equilibrated
against buffer A. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of
buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with 3 column volumes of
buffer B [50 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and
10% glycerol]. Eluted proteins (∼10–30 mg/mL) were pooled,
aliquoted (10 mL), frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at −80 °C. Individual aliquots were rapidly thawed, incubated
at 4 °C overnight with purified TEV protease (1/100 weight ratio),
and applied in two separate runs to a Superdex 200 16/60 (GE Healthcare)
column equilibrated against buffer C [10 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 150 mM
NaCl, and 10% glycerol]. Fractions from the primary peak were pooled
and concentrated to 10–15 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration,
aliquoted (500 μL), frozen by being immersed in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at −80 °C. The purified protein contained 0.6
equiv of Mn and 2.4 equiv of Zn as determined by inductively coupled
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

Assay for AMP
Cv1693 hydrolyzes
pApA to release two
molecules of 5′-adenosine monophosphate (AMP). The rate of
hydrolysis of pApA was measured by coupling the formation of AMP to
the oxidation of NADH. Each 250 μL assay contained 250 mM KCl,
0.7 mM PEP, 0.5 mM ATP, 5.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM NADH, myokinase
(2 units), pyruvate kinase (2 units), and l-lactate dehydrogenase
(3 units) in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). The oxidation of NADH was followed
at 340 nm with a Spectromax 384 Plus 96-well plate reader from Molecular
Devices. The AMP coupling system assay was also used to measure the
initial rate of release of 5′-dAMP from the oligomer of DNA
(pdApdApdApdApdA) or 2′,5′-pAp.

Assay for Phosphate
The formation of phosphate was
assessed using the Pi ColorLock Gold assay kit from Innova
Biosciences according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
enzymatic assays were conducted in 25 mM HEPES containing 250 mM KCl
(pH 7.5) at 30 °C. The extinction coefficient of the phosphate–dye
complex was 68000 M–1 cm–1 (λ
= 650 nm) under the conditions used to assess the enzymatic activity.
The phosphate detection assay was also used to determine if free phosphate
was produced when 1.0 μM Cv1693 was incubated with 0.1 mM dAdAdAdAdAp,
3′-AMP, 3′-NADPH, CoA, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerol, 3′-phosphoadenosine
5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), pGpG, and ppGpp for 75 min at 30
°C.

Crystallization
Cv1693 was crystallized by sitting
drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C utilizing Intelliplates and 2 +
2 μL drops equilibrated against 70 μL reservoir solutions.
All crystallization work used a protein that was derived from expressions
that did not contain 2,2′-bipyridine, ZnCl2, or
MnCl2. Crystals for the unliganded and Mn/AMP structures
were grown from protein that included 2.0 mM EDTA during the overnight
TEV cleavage reaction. Crystals utilized for phasing were grown by
combining protein [10–15 mg/mL, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol,
20 mM inositol 5′-monophosphate, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.8)]
with 20% Peg2000 MME and 100 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.0). For the unliganded
(sulfate bound) structure, the crystallization conditions were Cv1693
[10–15 mg/mL, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM HEPES (pH
7.8)] and 25% PEG3350, 200 mM (NH4)2SO4, and 100 mM Bis-Tris (pH 6.5). For the Mn2+–AMP
complex, Cv1693 [10–15 mg/mL, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20
mM adenosine 5′-monophosphate, 5.0 mM MnCl2, and
10 mM HEPES (pH 7.8)] was combined with 20% Peg2000 MME and 100 mM
Bis-Tris (pH 6.0). Prior to data collection, crystals were soaked
in precipitant supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol and vitrified
by being immersed in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected in-house
on an R-AXIS IV++ detector with Cu Kα X-rays generated
by a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode generator and focused with OSMIC
mirrors. Data were integrated and scaled with HKL3000. Data statistics are listed in Table .

Structure Determination
To obtain experimental phases,
data were collected from crystals soaked for 3 min in a cryo solution
supplemented with either 50 mM trimethyllead acetate (TMLA) or 10
mM HgCl2. The structure was determined using single isomorphous
replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) utilizing the TMLA data
set as the anomalously scattering derivative and the HgCl2 data set as “native”. Determination of the heavy atom
constellation, phasing, and automatic chain tracing were performed
with PHENIX. The starting model was completed
by iterative rounds of model building utilizing COOT followed by refinement using PHENIX. There was a single
molecule per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 37%. Waters
were added to difference density map peaks (Fo – Fc &gt; 3.5σ)
located
&lt;3.2 Å from potential hydrogen bonding partners. Translation–libration–screw
(TLS) refinement was included in the final rounds with the number
of domains determined by PHENIX. The quality of the final model was
validated with MOLPROBITY. Data collection
and refinement statistics for Cv1693 are listed in Tables  and .

Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography
Proteins were
analyzed by analytical size exclusion chromatography with a 10 mm
× 300 mm SUPERDEX 200 column (GE-Healthcare) using thyroglobulin
(670 kDa), δ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myglobin
(17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa) as molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad
151-1901).

Bioinformatics
The protein sequences
from various cog’s
were retrieved from the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and Microbesonline (http://www.microbesonline.org) databases. The redundant sequences from cog0613 obtained
from the NCBI database were removed using Jalview version 2.7 and then converted into FASTA format. Cytoscape
version 2.8.2 was used to create protein sequence network diagrams, while Jalview version 2.7 was used to make the
amino acid sequence alignments.

Results
Structure Determination
of Cv1693
Crystals of Cv1693
from the original crystallization attempts were thin spindly needles
that did not improve in shape upon standard grid screening protocols.
A search of the PDB revealed that the structure of a distantly related
protein from cog0613 (Bad1165 from B. adolescentis, PDB entry 3O0F, sequence identity of 25%) had previously been determined with bound
adenosine monophosphate (AMP). In addition, several mono- and diphosphorylated
nucleosides were found to increase the thermostability of Cv1693 by
fluorescence-monitored thermal denaturation (data not shown). As such,
the original Cv1693 crystallization conditions were rescreened with
added inosine monophosphate (IMP), cytidine monophosphate (CMP), or
AMP. In these experiments, IMP gave the best improvement in the crystals,
such that several derivative data sets could be collected. The structure
of Cv1693 was determined by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous
dispersion from a trimethyllead acetate derivatized crystal. Analysis
of the electron density maps originating from Cv1693 crystals grown
in the presence of IMP with no added metal indicated low occupancy
for the three metal sites and unsatisfactory density for the nucleoside.
The occupancies of the metal sites are consistent with the ICP-metal
analysis for the protein used in the crystallization, which exhibited
a mixture of Ni2+ (0.6 equiv), Zn2+ (0.2 equiv),
and Fe2+ (0.1 equiv).

In an attempt to improve the
homogeneity of the crystals, we performed a new round of crystal screening
after Cv1693 had been treated with EDTA to remove the metals. The
structure of apoenzyme (no metals) Cv1693 was determined from crystallization
conditions that included Peg3350 and ammonium sulfate. In this structure,
there is no electron density for the metal ions, and sulfate is bound
in the nucleoside 5′-phosphate binding site. The structure
of the complex with Mn2+ and AMP was determined from crystals
grown in the presence of Mn2+ and AMP without ammonium
sulfate. The structures of Cv1693 and the Cv1693 metal–nucleoside
complex are nearly identical with no large-scale structural movements
[root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.22 Å, 284 common Cα
atoms], and only small side chain positional differences in the ligands
to the metals; all subsequent discussion will pertain to the AMP-bound
structure.

Structure of Cv1693
Cv1693 crystallized
with a single
molecule per asymmetric unit. An analysis of the intermolecular contacts
within the crystal suggests that Cv1693 is monomeric in solution,
consistent with analytical gel filtration results. The entire sequence
of Cv1693 could be fit to the electron density except for a portion
of one loop (residues 255–257). Refinement statistics are listed
in Table . Cv1693 exhibits the (β/α)-barrel
fold common to members of the amidohydrolase superfamily but with
significant deviations (Figure ). In Cv1693,
the third β-strand of the barrel, β3, is significantly
longer than the strand usually seen for other members of the AHS.
Furthermore, the bridging ligand between two of the metals (Mα and Mβ) is usually located at the
end of β-strand 3 or 4, but in Cv1693, the bridging ligand (Glu-64)
is positioned at the center of elongated β-strand 3. Therefore,
in keeping with the β-strand numbering scheme for other members
of the AHS used to designate key active site residues with respect
to their β-strand number, we have chosen to designate β3 as β3/4. While most AHS (β/α)-barrels
are composed completely of parallel β-strands, the fifth β-strand
of Cv1693, β5, is antiparallel to β3/4 and β6. In addition, Cv1693 lacks two (β/α)-barrel
α-helices (α3 and α4) and
includes an insertion (amino acids 83–171, α5b–α5e) between β5 and α5f. One of the helices, α5a, assumes the typical
position of α3, and the other, α5a–α5e, forms a four-helix bundle that caps
the top of the (β/α)-barrel and contains several residues
that contact adenosine 5′-monophosphate. These residues include
Arg-99, Arg-102, Arg-134, Thr-135, and Phe-154. A stereo image of
Cv1693 is presented in Figure .

Schematic of
the secondary structure of Cv1693. The α- and
β-metal sites, which are a common feature among members of the
PHP family and some amidohydrolase enzymes, are shown as orange spheres,
while the γ-metal site, unique to the PHP family members, is
shown as a blue sphere. The strands and helices that constitute the
distorted TIM- or (β/α)7-barrel are colored
green and gray, respectively. The long β-strand-3/4 is colored
purple, while the antiparallel β-strand 5, unique to members
of cog0613 among AHS members, is highlighted with a red border. The
insertion element consisting of α-helices is colored blue, and
the positions of the enzyme residues seen to interact with the bound
5′-AMP are shown as red lines.

and strands as orange arrows. Three bound manganese ions are shown
as maroon spheres, and bound inorganic phosphate and adenosine monophosphate
are shown as sticks, colored by atom type. The insertion sequence
comprises helices α5a and α5b.

Metal Center
Clear
electron density was observed for
three manganese ions (Mnα, Mnβ,
and Mnγ) and AMP. In addition, a tetragonally shaped
density feature bridging the three metal ions was interpreted as a
phosphate ion assumed to originate from degradation of AMP (Figure ). A comparison of thermal factors with coordinating
protein ligands suggests the Mn2+–AMP–HPO42– species approach full occupancy in the
ternary complex. Mnα and Mnβ are
bridged by contacts to Glu-64 from β3 and an oxygen
from inorganic phosphate. Mnα is coordinated to His-7
and His-9 at the end of β-strand 1 and Asp-248 at the end of
β-strand 8. Mnβ is ligated to His-75 (β4) and His-191 (end of β6). The third metal
coordinates to Asp-14 (β1–α1 loop), His-39 (β2–α2 loop),
and His-250 (β8–α8 loop).
The orthophosphate forms a bridge not only from Mnα to Mnβ but also from Mnα to Mnγ and is additionally coordinated by the guanidinium
group of Arg-194 projecting from the β6–α6 loop (Figure ).

ions. Residues colored by atom type with the adenosine monophosphate

between protein atoms and the manganese atoms are shown as dashed

Contacts between Cv1693
and AMP
All of the contacts
between Cv1693 and AMP originate from the insertion domain between
β5 and α5f. Arg-99 and Arg-103 from
α5b and Arg-134 from α5d form salt
bridges to the 5′-phosphate of AMP. In the APO structure, this
binding pocket was occupied by a sulfate ion. The only contact to
the adenine base is a stacking interaction with Phe-154 (α5e). The 2′-OH group of the ribose moiety forms a hydrogen
bond to Thr-135, and the 2′-OH (2.4 Å) and 3′-OH
(2.5 Å) groups are coordinated to the third metal (Mγ). Interestingly, the 3′-OH group is only 2.5 Å from
an oxygen of the metal-bound orthophosphate. The contacts to the bound
AMP and Pi are depicted in Figure .

Interactions of AMP with protein residues, the inorganic phosphate,
and the manganese ion are shown as dashed lines.

Substrate Profile
The kinetic constants kcat, Km, and kcat/Km are summarized in Table  for the hydrolysis of pApA and 11 3′,5′-nucleotide
bisphosphates. The substrates with the highest activity were N6-methyl-3′,5′-pAp (kcat/Km = 2.1 × 106 M–1 s–1) and pAp (kcat/Km = 1.4 ×
106 M–1 s–1), although
Cv1693 hydrolyzed several other 3′,5′-nucleotide bisphosphates
with similar catalytic efficiencies. At a 2′,5′-pAp
concentration of 100 μM, the upper limit for substrate turnover
was 0.015 s–1 in the presence of Cv1693. This is
more than 3 orders of magnitude slower than the hydrolysis of 3′,5′-pAp.
In all three of the bisphosphate mixtures (pCp, pGp, and pUp), the
ratios of 2′,5′-pNp and 3′,5′-pNp nucleotides
were close to 1:1, and thus, the apparent kinetic constants are assumed
to be for the 3′,5′-pNp compound. However, the inhibitory
properties of the 2′,5′-pNp compounds have not been
determined. Cv1693 was unable to hydrolyze other compounds when assayed
at a concentration of 100 μM: 3′-NADPH (≤8 ×
10–4 s–1), 3′-AMP (≤2
× 10–4 s–1), CoA (≤7
× 10–4 s–1), and a 3′-phosphorylated
5-mer of DNA dAdAdAdAdAp (≤1 × 10–4 s–1). The 5′-phosphorylated 5-mer of DNA, pdApdApdApdApdA,
abbreviated (pdA)5, was a poor substrate for Cv1693 with
an estimated rate constant of ∼7 × 10–3 s–1 at a concentration of 100 μM.

Discussion
Substrate
Determination
We have demonstrated that Cv1693
from C. violaceum catalyzes the efficient hydrolysis
of 3′,5′-adenosine bisphosphate (pAp) to 5′-AMP
and orthophosphate; this reaction is presented in Scheme . In addition to pAp, this enzyme will also hydrolyze
pCp, pUp, pTp, and pGp with nearly equivalent catalytic efficiency.
However, this enzyme will not hydrolyze 2′,5′-pAp, and
the hydrolysis of the simple dinucleotide, pApA to 5′-AMP,
is slower by 2 orders of magnitude. The successful functional annotation
of Cv1693 began with the determination of the three-dimensional structure
of this enzyme and the recognition that another protein of unknown
function, Bad1165 from B. adolscentis, was structurally
similar (PDB entry 3O0F) despite a low level of sequence identity (25%). Because Bad1165
had been successfully crystallized with AMP, a nucleotide cocrystallization
scan and an exchange of active site metals eventually led to the successful
determination of the structure of Cv1693 with AMP, three manganese
ions, and a phosphate ion. The numerous interactions of three arginine
residues from the Cv1693 insertion domain with the 5′-phosphate
of AMP suggested that the true substrate would bind an AMP-like moiety
in this pocket and contribute to substrate recognition.

The
initial indication that Cv1693 is a phosphatase originated from the
fact that histidinol phosphate phosphatase (HPP) is also a member
of the AHS from the structurally similar cog1387. Enzymes within this
cog bind three divalent cations in the active site and catalyze the
hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters. In
addition, Bad1165 had been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, but the hydrolysis of pNp-like
substrates has apparently not been investigated. Finally, the proximity of orthophosphate in the active
site of Cv1693 to the 3′-OH group of the bound AMP in the ternary
complex suggested that this enzyme would likely hydrolyze compounds
such as 3′,5′-cAMP, 3′,5′-pAp, 2′,5′-pAp,
and 3′-AMP. The utilization of a small substrate library quickly
demonstrated that Cv1693 efficiently hydrolyzes 3′,5′-pAp
to orthophosphate and 5′-AMP with a kcat/Km value that exceeds 106 M–1 s–1. The enzyme has
a rather broad specificity for the identity of the aromatic base,
and the 2′-hydroxyl is relatively unimportant for substrate
recognition. Additionally, the enzyme can slowly hydrolyze short oligonucleotides
with a terminal 5′-phosphate but will not hydrolyze short oligonucleotides
without a terminal 5′-phosphate. However, the rate of hydrolysis
of the phosphodiester bonds in short oligonucleotides is significantly
slower than the rate of hydrolysis of the phosphomonoester bond in
pAp.

Structural Comparison to Bad1165
A structure similarity
search using the secondary structure similarity matching server, with a 70% secondary structure match requirement,
returned only one structural homologue: Bad1165 from B. adolescentis (rmsd of 1.87 Å over 255 common Cα atoms). The three-dimensional
structure of Bad1165 was determined in complex with phosphate to 2.4
Å resolution (PDB entry 3E0F) and AMP and phosphate to 1.9 Å resolution (PDB
entry 3O0F). On the basis of anomalous data, the metal ions
in Bad1165 were modeled as Fe ions for Mα and Mβ and Zn for Mγ. All of the protein-derived
ligands to the three metals are conserved between Bad1165 and Cv1693,
and the positions of the metal ions are very similar despite differences
in metal content. Two other active site features are strictly conserved
between these enzymes: (a) the three arginine residues originating
from the insertion domain that coordinate the 5′-phosphate
and (b) the phenylalanine side chain, also from the insertion domain,
that stacks against the adenine ring. However, despite these similarities,
the adenosine moiety takes a slightly different pose in Bad1165. In
Cv1693, the ribose is in the 3′-endo conformation
and the adenine is in the anti conformation, while
in Bad1165, the ribose is in the 0–4′-endo conformation and the adenine is in the syn conformation.
In Cv1693, the 2′- and 3′-OH groups interact with Mγ and the 3′-OH group also interacts with the
orthophosphate, while in Bad1165, the 2′- and 3′-OH
groups interact with the orthophosphate and not with any of the active
site metals. In Bad1165, there is a bridging water molecule between
metals Mα and Mβ, while in Cv1693,
one of the oxygens of the orthophosphate bridges these two metals.
In Bad1165, the adenine ring makes hydrogen bonds to the side chains
of Arg-161 and Ser-162 from the insertion domain (not conserved in
Cv1693), and to the backbone carbonyl of Gly-265 on a flexible loop
between β8 and α8. In Cv1693, this
loop is disordered, and the adenine, because of its anti conformation, does not approach this loop. Finally, in Cv1693, Thr-135
from the insertion domain makes a hydrogen bond with the 2′-OH
group, while in Bad1165, this residue is a proline. Both enzymes have
a positively charged residue interacting with the bound orthophosphate;
in Bad1165, this is a lysine residue from the flexible loop between
β8 and α8, and in Cv1693, it is
an arginine residue from the loop between β6 and
α6. The structural overlay of Cv1693 and Bad1165
is presented in Figure , and the specific
interactions of AMP in the active site of Bad1165 are presented in
Figure .

Bioinformatic Analysis
The apparent physiological substrate
for Cv1693 is 3′,5′-adenosine bisphosphate. In the cell,
the two most common sources of this substrate occur after the transfer
of a sulfate from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate
(PAPS) and the transfer of the phosphopantetheine group of CoASH to
the acyl-carrier protein (ACP)., In many bacteria such
as Escherichia coli, the pAp product is hydrolyzed
to 5′-AMP and orthophosphate by an enzyme denoted CysQ. The CysQ enzyme from Es. coli K12 (locus tag b4214) belongs to cog1218 and hydrolyzes pAp with
a catalytic efficiency of ∼107 M–1 s–1. The CysQ from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rv2131c, has a reported kcat/Km for the hydrolysis
of pAp of 7 × 105 M–1 s–1. It has also been reported that NrnA
(YtqI) orthologs from Bacillus subtilis, M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium pneumoniae, and Streptococcus mutans can also catalyze the
hydrolysis of pAp, in addition to the hydrolysis of short pieces of
single-stranded RNA., These bifunctional enzymes (pAp
phosphatase and nano RNase) belong to cog0618.

The prevalence
of enzymes from different families catalyzing the same function, i.e.,
pAp hydrolysis, prompted us to determine the distribution of these
enzymes among various organisms. Because &gt;6000 bacterial genomes
have
been completely sequenced, it was more efficient to deal with a representative
subset of the sequenced bacterial genomes. We used the 1752 bacterial
genomes available in the Microbesonline database (October 2013) and
searched for protein sequences from cog0613, cog1218, and cog0618.
This exercise retrieved 964, 830, and 856 protein sequences from three
cog’s, respectively. A sequence network diagram at a BLAST E value of 1 × 10–70 was constructed
for each of these cog’s (see Figures S1–S3 of the ). Any two sequences connected
by lines bear a level of sequence similarity greater than the BLAST E value of 1 × 10–70, which corresponds
to an overall level of sequence identity of ≥40%. We then identified
the proteins that have been biochemically characterized from each
of the three cog’s and then annotated all protein sequences
within the representative groups in the SSN to possess the same enzymatic
function as the experimentally characterized enzyme. We were able
to provisionally annotate 118 enzymes from cog0613, 309 from cog1218,
and 283 from cog0618 as pAp phosphatases in this manner. When we compared
the list of organisms to which each of these enzymes belonged, we
found that ∼6% of the organisms had apparent pAp phosphatases
from two of the three cog’s discussed here, while the remaining
organisms had a pAp phosphatase from just one of the three cog’s
(see the Venn diagram in Figure S4 of the ). There was no instance of an organism possessing
pAp phosphatases from all three cog’s. Further examination
of the phylogenetic classification of each organism revealed that
organisms possessing the pAp phosphatase from cog0613 are predominantly
betaproteobacteria (∼97%), those from cog1218 are largely gammaproteobacteria
(∼74%), while those from cog0618 are largely bacilli from the
phylum Firmicutes (80%) (see pie charts showing the phylogenetic distribution
of pAp phosphatases from the three cog’s in Figures S5–S7
of the ). It is clear
that different classes of microorganisms have evolved enzymes to hydrolyze
pAp from different families. This is also a strong indication that
the physiological function of Cv1693 and its closely related orthologs
(colored blue in Figure ) from cog0613 is
the hydrolysis of pAp.

The functional annotation of Cv1693 along
with its available crystal
structure provides an ideal platform for predicting new enzymatic
functions in cog0613 based on the sequence–structure–function
correlations. A sequence alignment of Cv1693 from C. violaceum, b1266 (an enzyme annotated as TrpH) from E. coli, Bad1165 from B. adolescentis, and Elen0235 (cyclic
phosphate dihydrolase) from E. lenta is presented
in Figure . Cv1693 and Elen0235 are the two
known functional annotations from cog0613, and the crystal structures
of Cv1693 and Bad1165 are available. TrpH from E. coli and its closely related orthologs
(colored yellow in Figure ) constitute the
largest cluster of proteins of unknown function in cog0613. It is
apparent from the sequence alignment that TrpH possesses all of the
residues that bind the three metal ions in the active site, indicating
that this enzyme likely catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters.
All residues, except one, in Cv1693 that interact with 5′-AMP
and orthophosphate in the crystal structure are conserved in TrpH.
The sole exception is that of Thr-135 from the insertion domain in
Cv1693, which interacts with the 2′-OH group and 4′-oxygen
of 5′-AMP and is replaced by Gly-142 in TrpH. However, because
Cv1693 cannot distinguish between 3′,5′-pNp and 2′-deoxy-3′,5′-pNp,
Thr-135 may not be a critical residue for substrate recognition. This
leads us to the hypothesis that the substrate profile for TrpH, if
distinct from that of Cv1693, will closely resemble 3′,5′-pNp.
If distinct, two possible substrates of TrpH may include 2′-substituted
3′,5′-bisphosphonucleotides or 2′,5′-bisphosphonucleotides,
because the relatively small glycine residue can be envisaged to accommodate
a larger functional group at the enzyme active site.

Conclusions
We have determined the crystal structure
of Cv1693 from cog0613 of the amidohydrolase superfamily with 5′-AMP
and orthophosphate bound in the active site. The enzyme was shown
to hydrolyze the 3′-phosphate from the substrate 3′,5′-pAp,
and the substrate profile was shown to include various 3′,5′-bisphosphonucleotides.
Bioinformatic analysis showed that the vast majority of organisms
that possess a closely related ortholog of Cv1693 do not possess an
enzyme from cog1218 (CysQ) or cog0618 (YtqI or NrnA) that can catalyze
the same reaction. This observation supports the hypothesis that pAp
is the physiological substrate of Cv1693.
