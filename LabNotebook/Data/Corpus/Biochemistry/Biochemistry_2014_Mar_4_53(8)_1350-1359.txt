The mitochondrial enzymes Put1p
and Put2p catalyze proline catabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Figure ). Put1p is a flavin-dependent dehydrogenase
that catalyzes the oxidation of l-proline to Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and couples proline oxidation
to reduction of ubiquinone. Put2p is a
P5C dehydrogenase (P5CDH, EC 1.2.1.88, formerly EC 1.5.1.12) and is
also known as ALDH4A1 in reference to its membership in family 4 of
the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily. Put2p catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of γ-glutamate
semialdehyde (GSA, the hydrolysis product of P5C) to l-glutamate.
In total, the proline catabolic pathway catalyzes a four-electron
oxidation of proline.

Reactions catalyzed by the yeast proline catabolic enzymes
Put1p
and Put2p.

Several studies have shown that
proline is important in various
organisms for stress protection. The accumulation
of proline in yeast leads to improved freeze tolerance. In contrast to that of proline, the accumulation
of P5C is associated with toxicity effects and induced cell death
in yeast., Coordinated expression of PUT1 and PUT2 is important for avoiding buildup of P5C.
The PUT1 and PUT2 genes are upregulated
by proline under nitrogen limiting conditions and, together with glutamate
dehydrogenase, allow yeast to utilize proline as a nitrogen source. The mechanism of P5C toxicity involves inhibition
of mitochondrial respiration and an increased level of production
of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly,
an N-acetyltransferase enzyme known as Mpr1 acetylates
P5C, thereby decreasing its level of accumulation and weakening its
harmful effects in yeast.

Mammalian
P5CDHs have been characterized biochemically. Early studies
of the human (HsP5CDH) and rat enzymes established the order of substrate
binding and product release, as well as substrate preferences.− More recent work on HsP5CDH and mouse P5CDH (MmP5CDH) provided additional
details about the kinetic mechanism and the molecular basis of type
II hyperprolinemia, a metabolic disorder
caused by a defect in ALDH4A1 function.−

The three-dimensional
structures of P5CDHs have been studied intensely.
Tahirov’s group reported the first P5CDH structure using the
enzyme from Thermus thermophilus (TtP5CDH)., We subsequently determined the structures of HsP5CDH and MmP5CDH,, and the New York Structural Genomics Research Consortium has deposited
structures of two Bacillus P5CDHs in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) (entries 3QAN and 3RJL). Collectively, the structures confirmed P5CDH as a member of the
ALDH superfamily, contributed additional information about the catalytic
mechanism, and provided insight into the structural basis of cofactor
and semialdehyde selectivity. We also determined the solution oligomeric
states and quaternary structures of several P5CDHs. The human, mouse, and Bacillus enzymes
are dimeric in solution, whereas TtP5CDH and Deinococcus radiodurans P5CDH (DrP5CDH) form trimer-of-dimers hexamers in solution. Thus,
the protein fold, but not the oligomeric state, is conserved within
the ALDH4A1 subfamily.

Although the yeast PUT genes were identified more
than 30 years ago, the Put1p and Put2p enzymes have remained relatively
understudied. Wanduragala et al. reported the purification and characterization
of Put1p in 2010, but analogous studies
of Put2p have not appeared in the literature. We therefore have created
a recombinant bacterial expression system for Put2p, measured the
steady-state kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme, determined
the crystal structure, and deduced the oligomeric state and quaternary
structure in solution from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).

Experimental
Procedures
Subcloning and Mutagenesis
The PUT2 gene was obtained from M. Brandriss of the Rutgers New Jersey Medical
School and subcloned into vectors pET14b using NdeI and XhoI and pKA8H
between NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, resulting in pET14b-PUT2
and pKA8H-PUT2 constructs. DNA encoding residues 23–575, which
lacks the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptide, was amplified from pKA8H using AAACATATGAAGCCCCCCAAGCACATAAG
as the forward primer and the T7 terminator as the reverse primer.
The resulting fragment was subcloned into pKA8H using NdeI and BamHI
to give the pKA8H-PUT2Δ22 construct. The expressed protein has
an N-terminal His8 tag and tobacco etch virus protease
cleavage site.

The W193A mutant of Put2p was created from pKA8H-PUT2Δ22
with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) using
the forward primer (5′-GGTACAATCTACCGTTTGCTGACAGATCTGC-3′)
and reverse primer (5′-GCAGATCTGTCAGCAAACGGTAGATTGTACC-3′).
The mutation was confirmed using DNA sequencing.

Expression
and Purification of Put2p
Put2p and Put2p
mutant W193A were expressed in Bl21(DE3)pLysS cells. Cells were grown
at 37 °C and 250 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.6 and
induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 8 h at 22 °C and 200 rpm. The cells
were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 30 min and resuspended
in 20 mM HEPES, 60 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0). Cells were quick
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until they
were further purified.

Thawed cells were broken by sonication
and centrifuged at 16500 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant was applied
to a HisTrap HP column that had been charged with Ni2+ and
equilibrated with 20 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0).
The column was washed with equilibration buffer supplemented with
30 mM imidazole, and the enzyme was eluted with 300 mM imidazole.
Fractions containing Put2p were pooled, dialyzed into 50 mM Tris,
0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM tris(hydroxypropyl)phosphine (THP), and 5% glycerol
(pH 8.0), and loaded onto a HiTrap Q anion exchange column. Put2p
was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 M. Fractions
were analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis, pooled, and dialyzed into 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,
0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM THP, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0).

Crystallization
of Put2p
Crystallization trials were
performed in sitting drops at 20 °C using drops formed by mixing
1 μL each of the enzyme and reservoir solutions. Crystal screening
using commercially available kits (Hampton Research) was used to identify
promising crystallization conditions.

Put2p expressed from pKA8H-PUT2Δ22,
including the N-terminal His tag, was used for crystallization. Optimized
crystals were grown using 8 mg/mL enzyme and a reservoir containing
8–14% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5–6.5).
The crystals were cryoprotected with 15% PEG 3350, 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.0), and 20% glycerol.
The cryoprotected crystals were harvested with nylon loops (Hampton
Research) and plunged into liquid nitrogen. The space group is P63 with a = 109 Å and c = 181 Å. The asymmetric unit contains one dimer and
51% solvent, based on the method of Matthews.

Crystals of Put2p complexed with NAD+ were obtained
by cocrystallization using the procedure described above for the ligand-free
crystals. A stock solution containing 10 mM NAD+ and 7
mg/mL enzyme was used for crystallization. Optimized crystals were
grown by combining this stock and an equal volume of a reservoir containing
8–14% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5–6.5). These crystals were
cryoprotected with 12% PEG 3350, 0.1 M (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM NAD+, 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 5.5), and
15% (v/v) PEG 200. The cryoprotected crystals were harvested with
nylon loops and plunged into liquid nitrogen. The space group is P63 with a = 108 Å and c = 181 Å with a dimer in the asymmetric unit.

Expression,
Purification, and Crystallization of Tag-Free HsP5CDH
HsP5CDH
residues 18–563 with an N-terminal His tag were
expressed and purified as described previously. The His tag was removed with thrombin as follows. The purified
protein was dialyzed into thrombin cleavage buffer [20 mM Tris, 150
mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.0)] and incubated
with thrombin (1 unit of thrombin per 4 mg of HsP5CDH) for 1 day at
4 °C. Thrombin was removed using a HiTrap Benzamidine FF affinity
column. The cleaved His tag and residual unprocessed HsP5CDH were
removed by passing the sample through a Ni2+-charged HisTrap
HP column. The tag-free enzyme was collected in the flow-through,
dialyzed into 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM THP, and
5% glycerol (pH 8.0), and concentrated to 6 mg/mL for crystallization
trials.

Crystal screening revealed a promising crystal form
grown in PEG 3350 and MgCl2. Optimized crystals were grown
using a reservoir of 20–25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 M MgCl2, and 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0–8.0). The crystals were cryoprotected
with 25% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 M MgCl2, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.5),
and 20% (v/v) PEG 200. The cryoprotected crystals were harvested with
nylon loops and plunged into liquid nitrogen. The space group is P21 with a = 92.0 Å, b = 121.3 Å, c = 93.4 Å, and
β = 104.2°. The asymmetric unit contains two dimers and
39% solvent. This form differs from the
hexagonal form of His-tagged HsP5CDH reported previously.

X-ray Diffraction Data Collection, Phasing,
and Refinement
Crystals were analyzed at NE-CAT beamlines
24-ID-C and 24-ID-E
at the Advanced Photon Source using a Quantum 315 detector (Table ). The Put2p data set was obtained at beamline 24-ID-C
and consisted of 105 frames collected with an oscillation width of
1°, a detector distance of 225 mm, and an exposure time of 1.0
s/frame at 7% transmission. The data were processed to 1.95 Å
resolution using HKL2000. Data from Put2p–NAD+ crystals were collected at beamline 24-ID-E and processed
with XDS. The 2.2 Å resolution data
set consisted of 70 frames collected with an oscillation width of
1°, a detector distance of 200 mm, and an exposure time of 1.0
s/frame at 55% transmission. Data from HsP5CDH crystals were collected
at beamline 24-ID-C. The data set used for refinement consisted of
180 frames collected with an oscillation width of 1°, a detector
distance of 250 mm, and an exposure time of 1.0 s/frame at 4% transmission.
The data were processed to 1.95 Å resolution using HKL2000.

error estimate reported by PHENIX.

The phase problem was solved using molecular replacement
as implemented
in MOLREP. The search model for Put2p
was derived from a 1.3 Å resolution structure of mouse P5CDH
(PDB entry 3V9J, 43% identical sequence over 543 residues).
The search model for HsP5CDH was obtained from a 2.5 Å resolution
structure of HsP5CDH (PDB entry 3V9G()). The models
from molecular replacement were used as the starting points for several
rounds of model building with COOT and
refinement with PHENIX. The refined Put2p
structure was used as the starting point for refinement of the structure
of the Put2p–NAD+ complex.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
of Put2p
In preparation
for SAXS studies, wild-type Put2p was purified in a manner similar
to that used for crystallization except for the following modifications.
After the first Ni2+ affinity step, tobacco etch virus
protease was added to the pooled fractions and incubated at 28 °C
for 2 h. The protein was then dialyzed overnight against 20 mM HEPES,
100 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol (pH 8.2). The protein was then injected
onto the Ni2+ affinity column and eluted at 30 mM imidazole.
The fractions were collected, pooled, and dialyzed overnight against
50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM THP, and 5% glycerol. The
protein was further purified using anion exchange (HiTrap Q) and dialyzed
into 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM THP, and 5% glycerol
(pH 8.0). Finally, size exclusion chromatography was performed using
a Superdex 200 column that had been equilibrated in dialysis buffer.
Protein appearing in the void volume was discarded, while protein
that eluted as a single peak that was clearly separated from the void
volume was collected. The pooled fractions had a concentration of
approximately 3 mg/mL (BCA method). The protein was then concentrated
using a Millipore centrifugal unit to 7 mg/mL. The flow-through of
the centrifugal unit was reserved as the reference for SAXS. Put2p
mutant W193A was prepared similarly, except that the final buffer
had a somewhat lower pH and a higher ionic strength [50 mM Tris, 300
mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM THP, and 5% glycerol (pH 7.5)].

SAXS experiments were performed at SIBYLS beamline 12.3.1 of the
Advanced Light Source through the mail-in program., For each sample, scattering intensities were measured at three nominal
protein concentrations. Data were collected for each protein concentration
at exposure times of 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 s. The scattering curves
collected from the protein samples were corrected for background scattering
using intensity data collected from the reference buffer.

The
SAXS data were analyzed as follows. Composite scattering curves
were generated with PRIMUS by scaling
and merging the background-corrected low-q region
data from the 0.5 s exposure (wild type) or 0.1 s exposure (W193A)
with the high-q region data from the 3.0 s exposure
(wild type) or 6.0 s exposure (W193A). PRIMUS was also used to perform
Guinier analysis. FoXS was used to calculate theoretical scattering
profiles from atomic models. GNOM was
used to calculate pair distribution functions. The SASTBX server was used
for shape reconstruction calculations.

Analytical Ultracentrifugation
W193A (His tag removed)
was analyzed by sedimentation velocity using a Beckman XL-I analytical
ultracentrifuge. Following dialysis to equilibrium against the buffer
[50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM THP, and 5% glycerol
(pH 7.5)], the protein solution was diluted with dialysis buffer to
yield an absorbance (at 280 nm) of 0.95 in a 1.0 cm path length cuvette.
A 400 μL aliquot was loaded into the sample compartment of a
double-sector cell, assembled with a 1.2 cm charcoal-Epon centerpiece
and quartz windows. A slightly larger volume (430 μL) of dialysis
buffer was placed in the reference compartment. The sample cell was
placed in the rotor and allowed to equilibrate to 20 °C in the
rotor chamber for 2 h under vacuum, prior to beginning the experiment.
The sample was then sedimented at 30000 rpm, acquiring data at 4 min
intervals, until a total of 170 scans had been collected. The resulting
data set was analyzed with SEDFIT version 9.4, using the continuous c(s) and continuous c(M) distribution
models, allowing the frictional ratio to float.

Steady-State
Kinetics
P5CDH activity was measured with
Put2p expressed from pET14b-PUT2, including the N-terminal six-His
tag. Put2p activity was followed by monitoring the formation of NADH
at 20 °C as described previously for human P5CDH. The assay buffer contained 50 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.5) and 25 mM NaCl. The Put2p concentration was 0.4 μM
(25.6 μg/mL), and the NAD+ concentration was held
constant at 0.2 mM. Initial velocity data were collected using L-P5C
concentrations from 1 to 300 μM. Initial velocity data were
fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation to estimate Km and kcat.

Results
Steady-State
Kinetics Measurements
Brandriss and co-workers
previously measured Put2p enzymatic activity in cellular and mitochondrial
extracts to verify the identity of the enzyme and determine the subcellular
location.− To the best of our knowledge, the catalytic properties
of the purified enzyme have not been studied. We therefore performed
steady-state kinetic measurements of recombinant Put2p. Kinetic parameters
for Put2p were as follows: Km = 104 ±
4 μM L-P5C, and kcat = 1.5 ±
0.3 s–1, with kcat/Km = 14000 ± 3000 M–1 s–1. For reference, the kinetic constants for human P5CDH
are a Km of 32 μM L-P5C and a kcat of 10.0 s–1 (kcat/Km = 312500 M–1 s–1).

Protomer Structure
of Put2p
The 1.95 Å resolution
crystal structure of Put2p was determined (Table ). Put2p exhibits the expected ALDH fold, which consists of
three domains (Figure A). The N-terminal half
of the polypeptide chain contains a Rossmann fold domain and binds
NAD+ (residues 43–181, 200–319, and 536–553).
The catalytic domain (residues 320–535) interrupts the NAD+-binding domain and exhibits an open α/β fold
featuring a twisted seven-stranded β-sheet with all but one
strand in parallel. This domain furnishes the essential cysteine nucleophile
(Cys351), which is situated at the interface of the NAD+-binding and catalytic domains. The third domain is a bipartite β
substructure consisting of residues 182–199 and 554–565
that protrudes from the NAD+-binding domain. This domain
is involved in oligomerization. As with other ALDHs, Put2p forms a
dimer in which the oligomerization domain of one protomer engages
the catalytic domain of the other protomer (Figure B). The asymmetric unit contains one dimer. As described below,
three Put2p dimers assemble into a hexamer in solution.

Structure of
Put2p. (A) Protomer with the catalytic domain colored
green, the NAD+-binding domain blue, and the oligomerization
domain gold. The red sections represent the aldehyde-binding loop
(transplanted from a MmP5CDH structure), which is disordered in Put2p.
Selected side chains of the hexamerization hot spot are colored gray
(Trp193, Phe121, and Tyr122). (B) Structure of the Put2p dimer in
the asymmetric unit. The two protomers are colored blue and gold.
Red sections represent the aldehyde-binding loop, which is disordered
in Put2p.

The most conspicuous feature of
the Put2p structure is that which
is unseen. ALDHs have an ∼25-residue peptide that connects
the last strand of the catalytic domain to the second piece of the
oligomerization domain. This section corresponds to residues 523–547
of Put2p. Electron density for these residues is very weak, implying
substantial conformational disorder (Figure A). The lack of density for this part of the protein gives the impression
of a large void running lengthwise through the middle of the dimer
(Figure A).

Electron density evidence for disorder
in the aldehyde-binding
loops of Put2p and HsP5CDH. (A) Put2p dimer with 2Fo – Fc electron density
(1.0σ). The red sections represent the aldehyde-binding loops
transplanted from MmP5CDH. The green spheres represent the product
glutamate bound to MmP5CDH (PDB entry 3v9k). (B) Close-up view of the expected conformation
of the aldehyde-binding loop in Put2p. Put2p is colored gray. The
aldehyde-binding loop (pink), bound glutamate ligand (green), and
NAD+ of MmP5CDH have been fit onto Put2p to guide the eye.
(C) Dimer of monoclinic HsP5CDH with 2Fo – Fc electron density (1.0σ).
The red sections represent the aldehyde-binding loop of MmP5CDH, which
is disordered in the monoclinic crystal form of HsP5CDH. The green
spheres represent the product glutamate bound to MmP5CDH.

The omission of residues 524–546 from the
Put2p model is
notable because this region of ALDHs anchors the aldehyde substrate
in the active site (Figure B). In other P5CDHs
(and ALDHs in general), the 25-residue aldehyde-binding loop folds
into a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that forms the floor
of the aldehyde substrate entrance tunnel. In P5CDHs, the beginning
of the peptide provides critical hydrogen bonding groups that anchor
the backbone of GSA, as well as a conserved Phe that packs against
the aliphatic chain of GSA (Figure B).,, The observation of disorder in
the aldehyde anchor peptide suggests the hypothesis that in solution
the anchor peptide samples conformations other than the one that binds
the substrate.

Structure of the Put2p–NAD+ Complex
The structure of Put2p complexed with NAD+ was determined
(Table ). Electron density for the ADP group
of NAD+ is strong in both protomers (Figure ). Density for the nicotinamide ribose is strong in one protomer
and somewhat weaker in the other. Density for the nicotinamide is
diffuse in both protomers, implying disorder, and thus, the nicotinamide
was omitted from the final model deposited in the PDB. Disorder of
the nicotinamide has been reported for ALDHs.,,

Electron density and interactions for NAD+ bound to
Put2p. The cage represents a simulated annealing σA-weighted Fo – Fc omit map contoured at 3.0σ. The conformations
of Glu458 and Phe460 prior to NAD+ binding are colored
cyan.

NAD+ binds in the expected
location, with the adenine
ring wedged between valine and proline residues belonging to helices
of the Rossmann fold domain (Figure ). The
adenine ribose forms hydrogen bonds with Lys234, and the pyrophosphate
interacts with Ser288. The nicotinamide ribose hydrogen bonds with
Glu458. These interactions are also observed in the structure of the
MmP5CDH–NAD+ complex.

Binding of the cofactor is accompanied by side chain rotations
(Figure ). Phe460 rotates around χ1 by 96° to avoid a steric clash with the nicotinamide
ribose. Glu458 rotates by 120°, allowing a hydrogen bond with
the nicotinamide ribose. These torsional rotations have not been reported
for other P5CDHs.

Structure of Monoclinic HsP5CDH
To further explore
the idea that the aldehyde anchor peptide is flexible in solution,
the structure of a second eukaryotic P5CDH without a ligand bound
in the aldehyde site was determined. The structure of ligand-free
HsP5CDH was determined from a new monoclinic crystal form (Table ) that was obtained only after cleaving the N-terminal
His tag.

As in the Put2p structure, electron density for the
aldehyde anchor peptide of monoclinic HsP5CDH (residues 514–535)
is very weak (Figure C). Electron density
for these residues is essentially absent in chains A and D, and the
entire loop was omitted. In the other two chains in the asymmetric
unit, the binding of Mg2+ from the crystallization buffer
stabilizes residues 522–535 in a non-native conformation, but
the other residues of the loop remain disordered. Thus, the disordered
active site is not limited to Put2p.

Oligomeric State and Quaternary
Structure of Put2p
The oligomeric state of Put2p in solution
was investigated using
SAXS (Figure ). Guinier plots of data from
three samples having different protein concentrations yield a radius
of gyration (Rg) in the range of 47–48
Å. Calculations of the pair distribution function suggest a maximal
particle dimension of 140–150 Å and an Rg of 45 Å. The Rg of
the Put2p dimer in the asymmetric unit (Figure B) is only 31.5 Å, which suggests that a higher-order oligomer
is formed in solution. Furthermore, the theoretical SAXS curve calculated
from the dimer deviates substantially from the experimental curve
(Figure A).

SAXS analyses of Put2p. (A) Experimental
and calculated SAXS curves.
The inset shows a Guinier plot spanning the qRg range of 0.508–1.29. The linear fit of the Guinier
plot has an R2 of 0.9995. (B) Superposition
of the SAXS shape reconstruction envelope and the Put2p hexamer generated
from crystallographic symmetry. Two orthogonal views are shown.

The Put2p crystal lattice was
inspected to identify a higher-order
assembly that is consistent with the SAXS data. Application of the
crystallographic 3-fold rotation to the dimer in the asymmetric unit
generates a point group 32 hexamer with an Rg of 43.9 Å (Figure B), which
is close to the experimental Rg of 48
Å. The scattering profile calculated from the Put2p hexamer shows
good agreement with the experimental profile (Figure A). Slightly better agreement is obtained with the hexamer
of TtP5CDH (Figure A), which includes the
sections that are disordered in Put2p. Consideration of a mixture
of hexamers and dimers using minimal ensemble search did not improve the fit.

The hexamer oligomeric state
was confirmed by estimating the molecular
mass from SAXS data using the volume of correlation (Vc) invariant. The Vc of Put2p is 1459 Å2, which
corresponds to a molecular mass of 363 kDa. This value is within 4%
of the expected molecular mass of 376 kDa for a hexamer of the Put2p
protein used for SAXS. We concluded that the predominant form of Put2p
in solution is the trimer-of-dimers hexamer observed in the crystal
lattice.

Finally, shape reconstruction calculations are also
consistent
with the hexamer. The shape reconstruction was performed with the
SASTBX server, which makes no explicit
assumptions about the molecular mass, the number of residues, or the
oligomeric state of the particle under consideration. The envelope
is consistent with the crystallographic hexamer (Figure B).

Hexamerization Hot Spot of Put2p
We previously identified
a hexamerization hot spot in bacterial P5CDHs. The hot spot is located in the interface between two dimers
and is formed by α3 of one molecule and the oligomerization
domain of another molecule (Figure A). In
the bacterial P5CDH hexamers, an Arg residue of α3 (e.g., Arg100
of TtP5CDH) is at the center of the hot spot and forms several electrostatic
interactions across the dimer–dimer interface (Figure C). Mutation of this Arg to Ala in TtP5CDH or DrP5CDH
abrogates hexamerization in favor of dimers, showing that it is essential
for hexamer formation.

viewed down the 3-fold axis, showing the location of the hot spot
centered on Trp193 (shown as spheres). The six chains have different
colors. (B) Close-up view of the environment around Trp193 of Put2p.
The chains are colored as in panel A. (C) Hot spot of TtP5CDH, which
is centered on Arg100 of α3. The chains are colored as in panel
A.

Interestingly, Ala126 of Put2p
replaces Arg100 of TtP5CDH, while
Trp193 of Put2p replaces Asp166 of TtP5CDH of the oligomerization
domain (Figure B). Trp193 occupies the space
corresponding to the Arg100 side chain of TtP5CDH. The indole of Trp193
fits into a hole formed by several residues of α3 (Phe121, Tyr122,
Ser125, Ala126, and Leu129) as well as Val174 of α5 (Figure B). We therefore hypothesized that Trp193 is the
center of the hexamerization hot spot of Put2p, analogous to the essential
Arg of Tt5CDH and DrP5CDH. This idea was tested by creating Put2p
variant W193A.

The oligomeric state of W193A was determined
using sedimentation
velocity. Figure A displays a subset of the
velocity profiles, with the corresponding least-squares fits. Analysis
of the entire data set with SEDFIT yielded a symmetric sedimentation
coefficient distribution centered at 4.65 S (Figure B). The corresponding molecular mass distribution is centered
at 121 kDa (Figure C), which is within 3%
of the theoretical M of the W193A dimer (125 kDa).
Thus, mutation of Trp193 to Ala appears to have disrupted the hexamer,
as intended.

W193A was also analyzed using SAXS (Figure ). Guinier plots of data from three samples having
different protein
concentrations yield an Rg in the range
of 34.5–34.7 Å. Calculations of the pair distribution
function suggest a maximal particle dimension of 110–115 Å
and an Rg of 34.7 Å. As stated above,
the Rg of the Put2p dimer in the asymmetric
unit is 31.5 Å, whereas that of the hexamer is 44 Å. Thus,
the Rg of W193A is consistent with a dimer
in solution. The theoretical SAXS curve calculated from the Put2p
dimer agrees well with the experimental one, while the curve derived
from the hexamer curve shows significant deviation (Figure A). Furthermore, the envelope from shape reconstruction
calculations, performed with the SASTBX server, is consistent with
the crystallographic dimer (Figure B). Thus,
the SAXS data are also consistent with W193A being primarily dimeric
in solution.

Discussion
The disordered aldehyde
anchor loop is the major result from the
Put2p and HsP5CDH crystal structures reported here. It is tempting
to speculate that these structures represent the resting enzyme conformation,
implying that aldehyde binding stabilizes the active site. This interpretation
is supported by the fact that all other structures of eukaryotic P5CDHs
(human and mouse) have ligands bound in the aldehyde site, including
sulfate ion from the crystallization buffer (PDB entries 3V9J and 3V9H), the product glutamate (PDB entry 3V9K), and proline (PDB entry 4E3X), which
is a competitive inhibitor with respect to GSA. Although a ligand was not modeled in two other structures
(PDB entries 3V9L and 3V9G),
electron density consistent with an active site ligand, probably sulfate
ion, is nevertheless evident. Thus, none of the previously determined
structures of eukaryotic P5CDHs are truly representative of the aldehyde-free
conformation. Bacterial P5CDH structures, however, provide a counterargument;
a few bacterial P5CDHs have an ordered active site in the absence
of a ligand in the aldehyde site (e.g., PDB entries 2EHQ, 2BHP, and 3RJL). Nevertheless,
the observation that the aldehyde anchor peptide is disordered in
two different P5CDHs that were crystallized in unrelated lattices
suggests that the disorder may be functionally relevant, at least
for eukaryotic P5CDHs. At the very least, the structures provide evidence
that the aldehyde-binding loop is inherently flexible, possibly sampling
active and inactive conformations in the absence of the substrate.
In this view, Put2p would be an example of substrate recognition by
conformational selection. These results
add a new dimension to our understanding of ALDH substrate specificity.

Disorder in enzyme active sites on the
scale described here has
precedent, and retinal dehydrogenase II is the most germane example.
Also a member of the ALDH superfamily, retinal dehydrogenase II catalyzes
the oxidation of retinal to retinoic acid and is thus involved in
retinoic acid signaling. As in Put2p, the aldehyde-binding loop is
disordered in the crystal structure of retinal dehydrogenase II (PDB
entry 1BI9).
It has been proposed that the disordered loop plays a role in discriminating
retinal from smaller potential substrates.,

The discovery that Put2p is hexameric is unexpected. Put2p
and
HsP5CDH are eukaryotic P5CDHs that have 42% identical amino acid sequences,
yet Put2p is hexameric and HsP5CDH dimeric. The trimer-of-dimers hexamer described here for Put2p is also formed
by TtP5CDH and DrP5CDH, although Put2p
is only 30% identical to these bacterial P5CDHs. Curiously, other
bacterial P5CDHs, such as those from Bacillus species,
are dimeric. Thus, global sequence identity
and domain of life are poor predictors of the oligomeric states of
P5CDHs. Instead, we suggest that the hot spot theory of protein–protein
association provides a better explanation.,

The Put2p structure revealed Trp193 as a potential hot spot
residue.
Trp193 is located in the same region as the bacterial hexamerization
hot spot, where it forms nonpolar, knob-in-hole interactions across
the dimer–dimer interface (Figure B).
Furthermore, Trp, along with Tyr and Arg, is often found in protein–protein
interface hot spots. Mutation of Trp193
to Ala abrogates hexamer formation, suggesting that these nonpolar
interactions (Figure B) substitute for the
electrostatic interactions that stabilize the bacterial P5CDH hexamers
(Figure C). Thus, the ALDH4A1 hexamerization
hot spot appears to be a unique region of three-dimensional structural
space that must be occupied by residues capable of forming attractive
intermolecular forces for hexamerization to occur. Interestingly,
the precise nature of these forces appears to be less important that
than their location.

Finally, the hot spot theory provides a
satisfactory explanation
for why some P5CDHs are dimeric. A theoretical hexamer built from
HsP5CDH dimers has vacant space in the hot spot region instead of
the tight knob-in-hole interaction observed in Put2p. The result reflects
the fact that the mammalian enzymes have the short residue Thr in
place of Trp193. Also, hexamers built from the Bacillus P5CDH dimers show steric clashes of long side chains across the
dimer–dimer interface. Thus, the dimeric enzymes do not have
an appropriate constellation of residues for building a functional
hexamerization hot spot.
