Succinate-quinone oxidoreductase
(SQR), or succinate dehydrogenase, is complex II of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain and is also found in many aerobic and facultative
microorganisms. The enzyme, as part of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle, oxidizes succinate to fumarate, and the electrons produced
by this reaction are transferred through a series of redox-active
centers to the membrane quinone pool, thus providing reducing equivalents
to the respiratory chain that are used for oxidative phosphorylation
in the cell., Thus, complex II plays an important
role in energy-generation pathways, and it is known that homozygous
knockout of the complex is embryonic lethal in mammals. The SQR enzyme complex is a member of a large
family of related enzymes, which, in addition to succinate dehydrogenase,
include a number of related enzymes involved in anaerobic or microaerophilic
metabolism in facultative bacteria or lower eukaryotes, termed quinol-fumarate
reductase (QFR).,,

In higher eukaryotes and Escherichia coli, complex II is a membrane-integral heterotetramer oriented toward
the matrix in mitochondria and the cytoplasm in bacterial inner membranes.
The enzyme is composed of hydrophilic FAD- and iron–sulfur-containing
subunits bound to a two-subunit hydrophobic membrane anchor. The SdhA
subunit (∼66 kDa) contains a covalently bound FAD and the dicarboxylate
binding site. The SdhB subunit (∼27 kDa) contains three distinct
iron–sulfur clusters, [2Fe–2S]2+,1+, [4Fe–4S]2+,1+, and [3Fe–4S]1+,0, arranged to facilitate
electron transfer from the flavin to the ubiquinone-binding site.− The membrane-integral SdhC (∼15 kDa) and SdhD (∼13
kDa) subunits, each possessing three transmembrane helices, harbor
a low-spin heme b coordinated by a histidyl residue
from each subunit as well as the quinone-binding site (also composed
of amino acid residues from the SdhB subunit).,− It is known that the heme is not essential for catalysis
in complex II,, although it clearly plays a role
in stabilizing the enzyme complex., Because of
its relatively high reduction potential (Em = +36 mV), the heme b of the E. coli enzyme is reducible
by succinate, whereas that of bovine
complex II (Em = −185 mV) is not.,

The E. coli SQR has proven
to be
a useful model for studying electron transfer and the role of quinones in the complex II family of enzymes. This has
been facilitated by the known X-ray crystal structure of the complex
and disposition of the redox-active centers within it,, the ease of genetic manipulation, and the ability to produce significant
amounts of wild-type and mutant proteins., The redox-active centers of complex II are arranged in an approximately
linear array from the FAD of SdhA to the [2Fe–2S], [4Fe–4S],
and [3Fe–4S] clusters in SdhB. The apparent electron-transfer
pathway(s) then bifurcate, with the quinone and heme sites being approximately
7 and 8.3 Å (edge-to-edge, respectively) from the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and 7.6 Å from one another (again, edge-to-edge). Overall,
the intersite distances are well within the 14 Å distance thought
to represent the limit for effective electron transfer in proteins. Given its fundamental importance as well as
the accumulating evidence regarding the enzyme’s role in formation
of reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to disease,− it is important to understand electron transfer in complex II. Previously,
we have used the method of pulse radiolysis to investigate the kinetics
and thermodynamics of electron transfer in wild-type complex II as well as in other redox-active enzymes such
as xanthine oxidase and trimethylamine dehydrogenase., With this method, radiolytically generated reducing equivalents
are rapidly introduced into the enzyme under well-defined conditions
and subsequent intramolecular electron equilibration is followed spectrophotometrically.

These previous studies have suggested that in E.
coli SQR the heme b is in oxidation–reduction
equilibrium with the iron–sulfur clusters of the enzyme. Conventional kinetics in conjunction with EPR
spectroscopy have also suggested that the presence of quinone facilitates
reduction of the heme in E. coli SQR. To date, however, it has not been possible to
obtain a full description of the thermodynamic parameters driving
electron transfer or to establish essential structural features of
the electron-transfer pathways from the iron–sulfur cluster
relay to the ubiquinone (UQ) or b heme. Here, we
have used pulse radiolysis in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis
and a potent quinone site inhibitor to
probe the electron-transfer pathways in E. coli SQR further. These studies enable us to refine our previous kinetic
model and to define thermodynamic parameters.
We demonstrate that effective electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and ubiquinone is essential for rapid reduction of the heme;
we also are able to define the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters
fully for electron transfer in the context of Marcus theory and to
establish that electron transfer occurs via diabatic electron tunneling.

Experimental
Procedures
Strains, Plasmids, Growth Conditions, and Site-Directed Mutagenesis
E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC:kan) is completely deficient in chromosomally
encoded SQR protein and was used as the
host for expression of plasmid-encoded mutant or wild-type SQR. DW35
transformed with plasmid pFAS (sdhC+D+A+B+) was used for
expression of wild-type SQR following growth on LB medium under microaerophilic
conditions, as described previously. Mutations
were constructed using the QuikChange II (Agilent Technologies) site-directed
mutagenesis kit as previously described using appropriate forward and reverse mutagenic primers in the PCR
reaction.

Protein Expression and Purification
Wild-type and variant
SQR proteins were expressed and purified following minor modifications
of published procedures., Briefly, membranes
were resuspended in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA,
and complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche). Triton X-100 was
then added from a stock solution to a final concentration of 2% (w/v),
giving a final ratio of approximately 5 mg of protein to 1 mL of detergent
added. Triton X-100 is used to remove the endogenous quinone from
the enzyme, whereas the detergent usually used (C12E9, Anatrace, Maumee, OH) retains the endogenous quinone. The
homogenate was stirred briefly (∼15 min) at 4 °C and then
sedimented by centrifugation at 100 000g for
1 h. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.2 μm nylon
filter and kept on ice until chromatography. The dark reddish-brown
supernatant was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF column equilibrated
with 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v)
C12E9 (polyoxyethylene (9) dodecyl ether) was
used to exchange the Triton X-100. The DEAE-Sepharose column is washed
with two column volumes of the buffer and then with three column volumes
of the same buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl, and the SQR containing fractions
are then eluted with a gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 M NaCl in the same
buffer. The dark reddish-brown-containing SQR fractions are then combined
and concentrated using Amicon Centricon-30 filtration units. The enzyme
is then stored at approximately 50 mg/mL of protein in liquid N2 until use.

Pulse Radiolysis
The Dynaray 4 MV
linear accelerator
facility at the University of Auckland, New Zealand and radical detection
system was used for the pulse radiolysis studies as previously described. The experimental conditions used (N2O-saturated solutions containing 0.1 M sodium formate and 2.5 mM N-methylnicotinamide, NMN) produce radiolytic products of
water that are quantitatively converted (0.68 μM/Gy) to the
strongly reducing MeN• radical (Em = −1.01 V), which
represents the proximal reductant of the enzyme. Typically, 3 Gy radiation
doses producing 2 μM MeN• radicals in 200
ns were used to initiate the reactions. Spectral data is obtained
as the change in extinction coefficient relative to the prepulsed
fully oxidized enzyme, assuming the MeN• radical
is fully scavenged by the enzyme. Previous studies have shown that
the MeN• radicals react with SQR, xanthine oxidase,
and trimethylamine dehydrogenase with second-order rate constants
in excess of 108 M–1 s–1,− allowing one to use spectrophotometric methods to follow subsequent
slower (but in excess of 104 s–1) intramolecular
electron-transfer reactions. Thermodynamic parameters were determined
from the temperature dependence of accessible rate constants over
the range 10–35 °C using a temperature-controlled cell.

Enzyme Activity
Steady-state succinate oxidation with
the artificial electron acceptor phenazine ethosulfate (PES) and the
ubiquinone analogue UQ1 was coupled to the reduction of
2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCIP) as previously described.,, As a control for the experimental
conditions used during pulse radiolysis, it was found that there was
no affect of addition of 0.1 M formate or 2.5 mM NMN on the steady-state
kinetics of SQR (data not shown).

Potentiometric Titrations
and EPR Spectroscopy
Potentiometric
titrations for the [3Fe–4S] cluster were carried out on membrane
preparation enriched with wild-type and mutant SQR enzymes at 25 °C
as previously described., Titrations were carried
out at pH 7.0 in a buffer containing 0.1 M MOPS, 5 mM EDTA, and 1
mM malonate. EPR spectra were acquired with a Brüker Elexsys
E500 spectrometer equipped with a Brüker SHQE cavity and an
Oxford Instruments ESR900 flowing helium cryostat. The EPR spectra
from the [3Fe–4S]1+,0 center were recorded at 12
K (20 mW microwave power and 100 kHz modulation frequency). The [3Fe–4S]
spectra were recorded at modulations amplitudes of 10 Gpp. Five scans were accumulated for each sample. Reported Em values are accurate within ca. ±10 mV.

Results
Pulse
Radiolysis of Wild-Type and Variant SQR
The spectral
changes observed upon reduction of the several chromophores of wild-type E. coli SQR have been defined previously in titrations
with sodium dithionite, making it possible
to ascribe absorbance changes at different wavelengths to reduction
of the FAD, iron–sulfur, and heme centers of the enzyme. Bleaching
of absorbance in the 440–510 nm region is primarily due to
reduction of the flavin and iron–sulfur clusters of the enzyme (as noted in Figure 1 of ref ()), whereas absorbance increases
in the 420–435 nm region (and also 558 nm) are principally
due to reduction of the b heme. Previously, using wild-type SQR and pulse radiolysis, three
kinetic phases were observed for intramolecular electron transfers
(i.e., independent of enzyme concentration) following reduction of
the enzyme by the MeN• radical at a biomolecular
rate constant (k0) of 7 × 108 M–1 s–1 (the three kinetic
phases are shown in Figure 4 of ref (), whereas a partial kinetic scheme is shown in
Figure 9 of the same reference). The loss in the minor absorbance
of the MeN• radical at 450 nm for low concentrations
of the enzyme lead to a small amount of bleaching of the enzyme at
this wavelength, which together with
other observed spectral changes on the same time scale identify this
as heme reduction. At concentrations above ∼30 μM enzyme,
this fast bleaching of the enzyme occurred with no observable increase
in rate constant. This plateau in rate constant we now designate to
be k1 and can be ascribed to an electron-transfer
pathway between UQ and heme (k1 ∼
24 000 s–1), as shown in Figure , rather than arising from some association between
the N-methylnicotinamide and SQR. The reinterpretation
of this data is consistent with the short distance between UQ and
heme and accounts for the rapid appearance of reduced heme through
electron transfer from ubisemiquinone, which is produced in a minor
amount upon reaction of the MeN• radical with the
enzyme. The previous rate-determining step for the large reduction
of the heme from the reduced [3Fe–4S] (i.e., electron transfer
between the [3Fe–4S] and UQ) observed at 430 nm (formerly termed k1) occurs at a
slower rate of ∼7200 s–1 and is now designated
as k2 in Figure . The slowest of the three intramolecular electron-transfer processes
(i.e., between the [3Fe–4S] and the heme) representing k3 (∼843 s–1, Figure ) is the third kinetic pathway and had previously
be termed k2. The modified assignment of intramolecular kinetic pathways observed
for the wild-type protein is the in order of the relative distances
of the three redox centers from one another (Figure ).

One-electron reduction and subsequent rates of equilibration of
the reducing equivalent over the distances between redox-active centers
of wild-type SQR.

We have extended these
studies by examining variants of SQR designed
to interfere with potential electron-transfer pathways from the [3Fe–4S]
center to UQ and to the b heme. Optimal electron-transfer
pathways between the [3Fe–4S], UQ, and heme have been analyzed
using the program HARLEM (http://harlem.chem.cmu.edu), with two different X-ray structures of wild-type SQR in complex
with either ubiquinone (PDB code 1NEK at 2.6 Å resolution) or the inhibitor carboxin (PDB code 2WDQ, at 2.4 Å resolution). The HARLEM analysis indicates that three amino
acids, SdhB-Pro160, SdhB-His207, and SdhB-Ile209, are part of the
electron-transfer pathway from the [3Fe–4S] center to the UQ
and heme moieties of SQR (Figure ). In the
structure of the ubiquinone complex (1NEK), the primary electron-transfer path
between the [3Fe–4S] center and UQ involves two through-space
jumps via Ile-209 of SdhB (path 2, Figure ). When Ile-B209 is mutated in silico to Ala, a
secondary electron-transfer pathway is identified involving covalent
bonds of Cys-159 and Pro-160 of SdhB and a through-space jump to UQ
(path 1, Figure ). The analysis of the carboxin-bound
structure (2WDQ) suggests an alternate path through backbone covalent bonds of Cys-206
and His-207 of SdhB, then a through-space jump from the CD2 atom of
the imidazole ring of His-207, and then on to carboxin (path 3, Figure ). The heme b D-ring propionate
is approximately 8.2 and 8.4 Å from the [3Fe–4S] cluster
in the two SQR structures, with the same electron-transfer pathway
determined for the electron transfer between the heme and Fe–S
center (path 4, Figure ). This pathway also
involves Cys-206 and His-207 with through-space jumps between atom
ND1 of the imidazole and the O2D oxygen atom of the D-ring heme propionate.
Lastly, the calculated electron-transfer pathway between the heme b and UQ depends on the position of the quinoid ring in
the UQ-binding pocket. In the 2WDQ structure, the carboxin, which we suggest
represents the position of UQ, is approximately 3 Å from His-207
and thus would allow direct electron transfer between two redox-active
groups (path 5, Figure ).

Proposed electron-transfer
pathways between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster to UQ and heme b of SQR. The [3Fe–4S]
center is shown in red and gold spheres, UQ is shown in pink, and
the UQ-site inhibitor carboxin is shown in light green. Protein Data
Bank code 1NEK was used to derive the wild-type structure with UQ present, and
PDB code 2WDQ was used to derive the structure with carboxin. At the bottom of
the figure is shown the heme b in gray for the wild-type
structure and in green-blue for the structure with carboxin. The HARLEM
program was used to derive potential electron-transfer pathways between
the [3Fe–4S] center and the UQ-binding site, with three potential
pathways show by the gray dotted lines (1–3). Pathways 1 and
2 were determined with UQ present, and pathway 3 was determined using
the UQ-site inhibitor carboxin (path 3). The dotted red lines show
path 4 between the [3Fe–4S] and heme, which is the same for
both structures. The green dotted spheres show path 5 between the
heme b and the UQ-site when carboxin is present.

An initial steady-state survey
of several variants was conducted
to choose those most appropriate for pulse radiolysis experiments.
Steady-state kinetic assays of wild-type SQR and variants are shown
in Table . All enzyme forms retain essentially
full succinate-oxidase activity in the succinate-PES assay, indicating
that the amino acid substitutions have not perturbed the ability of
the enzyme to oxidize succinate and that the enzyme is fully assembled.
It has previously been shown that the SdhB-His207Thr variant retains
near wild-type activity in its ability to reduce UQ. By contrast, the succinate-UQ1 reductase activity
of both SdhB-Ile209 variants is significantly reduced (Table ). The SdhB-Ile209Ala variant retains 20% of the
succinate-UQ1 reductase activity, but the SdhB-Ile209Lys
enzyme retains less than 1% of wild-type activity. The latter result
is consistent with in silico modeling of the SdhB-Ile209Lys
mutation that suggests that the Lys substitution structurally interferes
with UQ binding at the quinone-catalytic site (Figure ). Table  also shows that the Km for UQ1 in the SdhB-His207Thr and
SdhB-Ile209Ala variant enzymes is similar to that of wild-type SQR
(unfortunately, the Km for the SdhB-Ile209Lys
variant could not be determined because of the minimal residual activity).
Mutation of SdhB-Pro160 to Ala has a lesser effect on UQ reduction
than either SdhB-Ile209 variant (Table ).
In addition, a double mutant of SdhB-Pro160Ala and Ile209Ala is approximately
90% compromised in its ability to reduce UQ. Unfortunately, the purified
SdhB-Pro160 variants are not sufficiently stable to analyze by pulse
radiolysis and were not further investigated. The SdhB-His207 and
SdhB-Ile209 variants (Figure A–C) were
thus chosen for further pulse radiolysis analysis, as amino acid substitutions
of these residues introduced gaps (Figure B,C compared to wild-type Figure A) that
might be expected to alter electron-transfer parameters.

Data taken from Tran et al. and Ruprecht et al., respectively.

The effect of the mutations
on the reduction potential of the [3Fe–4S]
cluster were ascertained by potentiometric EPR titration of the variants
using membranes highly enriched in the expressed proteins. Previous
work has shown that mutation of SdhB-His207 to Thr decreases the reduction
potential of the [3Fe–4S] cluster by more than 60 to +2 mV,
consistent with the loss of the positive charge near the cluster (Table )., These titrations revealed that
there was a ∼50 mV increase in the reduction
potential of the [3Fe–4S] cluster in the SdhB-Ile209Ala variant
(Em = +120 mV) and a larger increase to Em = +150 mV in the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant (Table ). The increase in the latter case can be rationalized
by the introduction of a positive charge near the environment of the
[3Fe–4S] cluster, as seen in other complex II enzymes., The basis for the observed increase in the [3Fe–4S] potential
in the SdhB-Ile209Ala variant is less clear, although it may reflect
changes in the degree of solvent exposure of the cluster. Regardless,
these data show that the reduction potential of the [3Fe–4S]
cluster varies over a range of ∼150 mV in the enzyme forms
studied in the present work.

Electron Transfer in the SdhB-His207Thr Variant
of SQR
The X-ray crystal structure of the SdhB-H207T variant
(PDB code 2WP9) has been determined
in the presence of the quinone-binding site inhibitor carboxin. In wild-type SQR, the Nδ atom of SdhB-His207
forms a hydrogen bond with one of the heme propionates. Substitution
of SdhB-His207 with threonine disrupts this interaction, causing the
heme propionate to adopt a different conformation that results in
a 1.0 Å larger gap between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and heme.
There also appears to be a small increase (∼0.4 Å) in
the gap between the proposed UQ-binding site and Thr207 compared to
the wild-type histidine. Pulse radiolysis experiments with the SdhB-His207Thr
variant reconstituted with UQ reveal only a single intramolecular
electron transfer, resulting in the partial reduction of the heme,
which contrasts with the two prominent electron-transfer processes
seen with wild-type SQR under similar conditions. The initially formed
MeN• radical, measured 2 μs after the electron
pulse, decays rapidly to a spectrum consistent with Fe/S reduction
(minor bleaching in the 400–420 nm region) and some heme reduction
(420–440 nm) by 50 μs followed by large spectral changes
in this spectral region over 20 ms that we interpret are consistent
with intramolecular electron transfer from the [3Fe–4S] cluster
to the heme with a rate constant of 160 s–1 at 25
°C (Figure ). This suggests that initial reduction by the MeN• radical is deposited on a redox center that has the ability to reduce
the heme, which we suggest is most likely the [3Fe–4S] center.
The observed rate constant is some 5-fold slower than the slowest
phase seen with the wild-type enzyme (∼840 s–1) and also attributed to equilibration between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and heme. We have also examined
the effect of atpenin A5 (AA5), a potent redox-inert inhibitor of
SQR that binds at the UQ catalytic site. In the presence of an equimolar concentration
of AA5, the rate of electron transfer to the heme in the SdhB-H207T
variant is unaffected. Similar results have been obtained using pentachlorophenol,
which also binds at the UQ site of the protein., These data suggest that electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
center and heme still occurs in the SdhB-His207Thr variant (albeit
at a somewhat reduced rate) but that electron transfer between [3Fe–4S]
and UQ has been significantly compromised (as evidenced by the lack
of any kinetic phase attributable to it). These data do not eliminate
the possibility that this latter process still occurs in this variant,
although this would require that k2 be
much smaller than k3. Overall, these data
indicate that SdhB-His207 and bound ubiquinone both facilitate efficient
electron transfer to the heme in SQR.

and phosphate buffer (5 mM, pH 7). Inset: Observations made at 428
nm associated with k3 ([3Fe–4S]
to b heme). The absorption spectra are the difference
spectra between the radical intermediates and the prereduced protein,
whereas the kinetic transients are the observed changes in transmittance
with time.

Electron Transfer in SdhB-Ile209
Variants of SQR
The
HARLEM analysis indicates that SdhB-Ile209 is central to the electron-transfer
pathway from the [3Fe–4S] cluster to UQ. Two amino acid substitutions
were therefore constructed to examine their effect on electron-transfer
kinetics: an SdhB-Ile209Ala variant that in silico analysis suggested should increase the through-space gap from Ile209
to UQ by 2 Å (from 3.1 to 5.1 Å) and an SdhB-Ile209Lys variant
in which in silico analysis suggests that the lysine
residue partially occludes the quinone-binding site (and also introduces
a positive charge at the site).

Pulse radiolysis experiments
with the SdhB-Ile209Ala variant revealed only a single intramolecular
electron transfer, similar to that seen with the SdhB-His207Thr variant,
although with the SdhB-Ile209Ala variant, the observed rate constant
is smaller, ∼80 s–1 (Figure ). This rate constant was unchanged when UQ was replaced with
AA5, indicating that electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
and heme is again being observed. With UQ bound, the SdhB-Ile209Lys
variant exhibited two kinetic phases, one with a rate constant of
252 ± 44 s–1 and the other with a slower rate
constant of 47 ± 5 s–1 (Figure ). In the absence of UQ (i.e., with an empty UQ-binding site),
a single rate constant of 249 ± 13 s–1 was
observed, similar to the faster phase observed in wild-type enzyme
in the presence of quinone. Lastly, addition of a stoichiometric amount
of AA5 to the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant also yielded only a single kinetic
phase with a rate constant of 234 ± 11 s–1.
These data indicate that the faster of the processes observed with
the SdhB-Ile209Lys involves electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and heme, with the much slower rate (∼47 s–1) seen with UQ being assigned to electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and the quinone. This may suggest that the quinone-binding
site in the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant is partially occupied and that
there is a slow equilibration between the [3Fe–4S] and UQ even
with the electron-transfer pathway perturbed by the mutation.

Thermodynamic and Marcus Parameters for Electron Transfer
Assuming that the observed intramolecular rate constants reflect
an approach to equilibrium between specific pairs of redox-active
centers, individual rate constants for forward and reverse reactions
between each redox-active center can be calculated using the known
reduction potentials for the centers (see ). Thermodynamic parameters governing all
three kinetic pathways in the wild-type enzyme, A, Eact, ΔG⧧, and
ΔS⧧, were obtained from transition-state
theory using Arrhenius and Eyring plots of the dependence of electron
transfer on temperature. Data for electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and heme for the SdhB-His207Thr and -Ile209Ala variants as
well as electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and
UQ in the case of the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant were similarly analyzed
(Table ). The Eyring pre-exponential term, A (s–1), contains the dimensionless transmission
coefficient, κ, which represents the fraction of molecules achieving
the transition state that subsequently proceed to products. The activation
energy, Eact, for the slowed [3Fe–4S]
to UQ phase in the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant is raised considerably relative
to wild-type enzyme. The free energy change, ΔG⧧, for all phases is similar, whereas the large
negative changes in entropy, ΔS⧧, most likely arises from charge separation (transfer from the initially
reduced [3Fe–4S] cluster) and charge delocalization at equilibrium.

An analysis of diabatic electron
transfer in SQR using Marcus theory
(eqs  and ) yields information
on the effect of site-directed mutagenesis on the reorganization energy,
λ, electronic coupling, Hab, and
the attenuation coefficient, β.()Because the driving force of electron
transfer
for each of the three intramolecular electron transfer processes being
examined is small, varying between 0.05 and 0.11 eV, it is valid to
plot ln(kT1/2) versus 1/T to obtain the Marcus pre-exponential factor, AM, from the intercept and the activation energy, EM, from the slope of the plot (m = −EM/kB). Plots for
the [3Fe–4S]/UQ and [3Fe–4S]/heme electron-transfer
events in wild-type enzyme are presented in Figure , and the derived data for the wild-type and mutant enzymes
are given in Table . Because ΔE0 ≪ λ, then λ ≈ 4ΔE0, and Hab can be
calculated. It has been proposed− that the maximum for k = 1.0 × 1013 s–1 when
λ is independent of distance, D. Using the
rate constants observed at 25 °C and the distances between the
redox-active centers established by the X-ray crystal structure, it is possible to calculate the attenuation coefficient,
β, from eq  (Table ).

The pre-exponential factors derived from Arrhenius and Marcus-type
plots are related, A (s–1) and AM (K1/2 s–1), with A being slightly smaller because of the effect of κ.
As for the Eact data, the EM values for [3Fe–4S]/heme electron transfer are
similar for wild-type and variants, whereas EM for [3Fe–4S]/UQ electron transfer with the SdhB-Ile209Lys
variant is raised compared to wild-type enzyme. The derived Eact and EM values
are the same within experimental error for all phases studied. Of
particular interest are the effect of the amino acid substitutions
on λ and β. Whereas these parameters are unchanged for
[3Fe–4S]/heme electron transfer in the ShdB-His207Thr and -Ile209Lys
variant enzymes compared to wild-type enzyme (thus providing additional
support of the assignment of this phase as being due to electron equilibration
between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and heme), the slow electron transfer
between [3Fe–4S] and UQ in the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant can be
attributed to a large increase in λ even though β values
are significantly smaller (Table ). There
is also an increase in λ for the [3Fe–4S]/heme phase
(kinetic phase 3, Table ) in the Ile209Ala
variant, but in this case, there is a much smaller change in β
compared to wild-type enzyme. The determined β values of ∼1.3
Å–1 in the UQ/heme (kinetic phase 1, Table ) and [3Fe–4S]/UQ (kinetic phase 2, Table ) in the wild-type protein are similar to values
found for diabatic electron transfer in many biological systems. There is no correlation between Hab values and k values, although the Hab values (Table ) are
≪kBT , indicating
that the donor and acceptor centers are weakly coupled and that electron
transfer occurs via quantum mechanical tunneling.

Discussion
In this study, one-electron reduction of SQR by pulse radiolysis
was used to define thermodynamic and other controlling parameters
for electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S], UQ, and heme centers
of the enzyme, thus providing a full description of these electron-transfer
pathways in the enzyme. Previous work using wild-type SQR has shown that the major site of reduction upon
reaction of the proximal reductant (the MeN• radical)
is at the [3Fe–4S] cluster, with some reduction also occurring
at the UQ center. This models the physiological reduction of the [3Fe–4S]
center following oxidation of succinate by the fully oxidized enzyme,
where electrons are transferred from the reduced FAD moiety individually
through the three Fe–S centers of SQR to the high-potential
[3Fe–4S] center. Time-resolved spectrophotometry reveals that
an electron deposited on the [3Fe–4S] center rapidly equilibrates
between it, the UQ, and heme. Because the spatial distribution and
reduction potentials of these three centers are known, the system
lends itself to a quantitative analysis of the factors controlling
intramolecular electron transfer in a multicentered redox-active protein.
The data presented in the current study allow us to modify our previous
model in which we had suggested that
the favored electron-transfer pathway was from the [3Fe–4S]–heme–UQ. This suggestion was influenced by using a high
concentration of the weaker-binding inhibitor pentachlorophenol (PCP),
which most likely only partially displaced UQ. Using the site-directed
variants of SQR and the potent quinone-site inhibitor atpenin A5,
the pulse radiolysis and steady-state kinetic data suggest that the
preferred electron-transfer pathway is from the [3Fe–4S] to
UQ and then to the b heme (Figure ). Support for this conclusion comes from the observation
of a larger initial reduction of the heme (as evidenced by the increase
in absorbance at 420–430 nm) at the end of the fast reduction
of the protein by the MeN• radical when UQ is present
compared to when UQ is removed or its site is blocked by atpenin A5
(data not shown). Thus, the occupancy of the UQ site clearly influences
the reduction of the heme. The data also show that when the UQ site
is perturbed by either mutation or occluded with an inhibitor electron
transfer from the [3Fe–4S] to the b heme does
occur, consistent with our previous model.

In the current study, the program HARLEM was used to identify
potential
paths for electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster, UQ,
and heme as well as the amino acid residues likely to be important
for rapid equilibration of electrons between them. In the pulse radiolysis
work described here with several SQR variants, the rates of electron
transfer between the redox-active centers are indeed observed to be
perturbed relative to wild-type enzyme, consistent with the rates
observed when the potent quinone-site inhibitor atpenin A5 is present.
Substitution of SdhB-His207 with threonine indicates that this residue
plays a pivotal role in electron transfer between [3Fe–4S]
and UQ and also between [3Fe–4S] and the heme. In the SdhB-His207Thr
variant, the gap between the UQ site and the [3Fe–4S] cluster
is not increased to the same extent as that between the heme and the
[3Fe–4S] cluster; however, the effect on electron transfer
is dramatically different, with that involving the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and UQ becoming too slow to be measured. Although the thermodynamic
and Marcus parameters controlling electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S]
cluster and heme are largely unchanged from that of the wild-type
enzyme, the pre-exponential factor (A and AM) is significantly decreased. This is most
likely due to the change in orientation of the heme propionates as
well as the increased gap between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and
the heme, resulting in a decrease in the rate constant for electron
transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and heme in the SdhB-His207Thr
variant. The SdhB-Ile209Lys variant also has similar thermodynamic
and Marcus parameters to the wild-type enzyme for electron transfer
between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and heme, but in this case, the
electron-transfer process could be followed, and the change in the
rate constant for electron transfer correlated with the changes in
Marcus parameters. Of interest is the small β value for electron
transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and heme that is observed
in the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant. A possible efficient pathway between
the [3Fe–4S] and heme center in the wild-type enzyme includes
a relatively small gap of 2.6 Å between the histidine imidazole
and the heme propionate. The dramatic decrease in β for electron
transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and UQ in the SdhB-Ile209Lys
variant relative to wild-type enzyme suggests that introduction of
the positive charge in the variant may perturb the structure of the
quinone-binding pocket and this in turn compromises efficient electron
transfer. However, electron transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster
and heme in the SdhB-Ile209Ala variant is only slightly perturbed,
consistent with a more modest structural perturbation as compared
with the SdhB-Ile209Lys variant.

During the physiological reduction
of SQR by succinate, two electrons
are introduced to the flavin at the active site, and these are then
distributed among the several redox-active centers of the enzyme.
Critical to enzyme turnover is the two- electron reduction of UQ to
its hydroquinone form, UQH2, which then departs from the
UQ-binding site. Despite the fact that electron transfer between the
[3Fe–4S] cluster and UQ is severely compromised in the SdhB-
His207Thr variant, it is observed to exhibit near wild-type activity
in steady-state succinate:ubiquinone assays (Table ). In this variant, the reduction potential of the [3Fe–4S]
center (+2 mV) is decreased by the mutation
to a lower value than that of the heme (+36 mV). Combined with our
findings that the [3Fe–4S]/heme electron-transfer parameters
are unchanged compared to the wild-type enzyme, this indicates that
reduction of UQ can most likely proceed efficiently via the heme.
The reduction potential of the [3Fe–4S] cluster in the SdhB-Ile209Lys
(+150 mV) and SdhB-Ile209Ala (+125 mV) variants are both considerably
higher than those of UQ (+90 mV) and the heme (+36 mV), indicating
that efficient reduction of UQ via the heme is unlikely when electron
transfer between the [3Fe–4S] cluster and heme is compromised.
This is apparent in the decreased activity of both of these variants
compared to the wild-type enzyme (Table ),
although structural changes to the UQ-binding site in the SdhB-Ile209Lys
variant may also be involved. This analysis also shows that in SQR
occupancy of the UQ-binding site is a prerequisite for efficient electron
transfer to the heme and that the process involves pure electron tunneling.
These latter results are consistent with previous steady-state kinetic
studies also suggesting that occupancy of the quinone site is essential
for rapid reduction of the heme, but
they also suggest that in the wild-type enzyme the electron can rapidly
shuttle between the reduced heme and quinone (k1, Figure ).

As noted above,
during the two-electron oxidation of succinate
resulting in formation of FADH2, the electrons sequentially
enter the chain of iron–sulfur clusters of SQR. The first electron
initially ends up at the highest potential iron sulfur cluster ([3Fe–4S]),
and consistent with the data reported here and our previous studies, this is followed by quinone reduction to the
stabilized semiquinone, which is in rapid equilibration with the heme.
The present work demonstrates that perturbation of the quinone-binding
pocket by mutation can significantly influence the rate of heme reduction
in complex II. Relevant to this are the data shown in Table  for the steady-state kinetics of the SdhB-Pro160
variants that indicates that this residue is also important in electron
transfer between the [3Fe–4S] and quinone (consistent with
the HARLEM pathway analysis). It should be noted that in humans mutation
of the residue equivalent to E. coli SdhB-Pro160 (human SdhB-Pro197) has been associated with paragangliomas
and phaeochromocytoma tumors.− It has also been noted that of
the germline mutations identified in human complex II, those in the
SDHB gene are most frequently associated with malignancy and a poor
clinical prognosis.− Recent studies of mammalian complex II have called
increasing attention to the role of the enzyme as a generator of reactive
oxygen species (ROS)., Available evidence suggests that
both the flavin semiquinone,, and ubisemiquinone radical− are likely sources of ROS. The
data presented here show that the rate of electron transfer in complex
II is altered by mutations that perturb the quinone-binding region
even when they do not significantly affect overall enzyme activity.
Because many of the missense substitutions of complex II associated
with human diseases map to the quinone-binding region of the enzyme,, it seems likely that alteration of electron distribution in the
quinone-binding domain, although having only subtle effects on activity,
may nevertheless increase the propensity for the enzyme to produce
ROS.

In summary, these studies show that complex II conserved
amino
acids SdhB-His207, SdhB-Ile209, and SdhB-Pro160 of the E. coli enzyme are part of the preferred electron-transfer
pathway.
