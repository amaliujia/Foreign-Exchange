A group
of microbial retinal proteins most closely related to the
proton pump xanthorhodopsin has a novel sequence motif and a novel
function. Instead of, or in addition to, proton transport, they perform
light-driven sodium ion transport, as reported for one representative
of this group (KR2) from Krokinobacter. In this paper,
we examine a similar protein, GLR from Gillisia limnaea, expressed in Escherichia coli, which shares some
properties with KR2 but transports only Na+. The absorption
spectrum of GLR is insensitive to Na+ at concentrations
of ≤3 M. However, very low concentrations of Na+ cause profound differences in the decay and rise time of photocycle
intermediates, consistent with a switch from a “Na+-independent” to a “Na+-dependent”
photocycle (or photocycle branch) at ∼60 μM Na+. The rates of photocycle steps in the latter, but not the former,
are linearly dependent on Na+ concentration. This suggests
that a high-affinity Na+ binding site is created transiently
after photoexcitation, and entry of Na+ from the bulk to
this site redirects the course of events in the remainder of the cycle.
A greater concentration of Na+ is needed for switching
the reaction path at lower pH. The data suggest therefore competition
between H+ and Na+ to determine the two alternative
pathways. The idea that a Na+ binding site can be created
at the Schiff base counterion is supported by the finding that upon
perturbation of this region in the D251E mutant, Na+ binds
without photoexcitation. Binding of Na+ to the mutant shifts
the chromophore maximum to the red like that of H+, which
occurs in the photocycle of the wild type.

The opsin-based
light-driven
ion pumps, like their prototype bacteriorhodopsin,1 are small (∼25 kDa) proteins2,3 constructed
of seven transmembrane helices that surround a retinal chromophore
at the center of the hydrophobic core.4 The retinal is attached through a protonated Schiff base (C=NH+) to a lysine residue. In the initial state, the retinal is
typically in the all-trans configuration, but upon
light absorption, it undergoes photoisomerization to the 13-cis,15-anti form.5,6 The
isomerization initiates intraprotein transfer of an ion, H+ in bacteriorhodopsin7 and related proton
pumps8,9 and Cl– in halorhodopsin.10 This initial internal transfer is followed by
further ion transfer steps, which ultimately result in the translocation
of the transported ion across the width of the membrane.11 The relative simplicity of such ion pumps, and
the benefits that they provide for cell survival as light energy transducers,
explains the abundance of these proteins in many bacteria and fungi.12−14

Recently, a new group of microbial retinal proteins capable
of
light-driven Na+ transport was identified.15−17 The genome sequences of Dokdonia donghaensis,16Krokinobacter sp.,18Gillisia limnaea,19 and other organisms16,20 revealed the presence of unusual retinal proteins in which the Schiff
base counterion and proton acceptor, homologous to Asp85 in bacteriorhodopsin,
is substituted with Asn, the residue homologous to Thr89 is an Asp,
and the residue at the location of the proton donor, Asp96 in bacteriorhodopsin,
is a Gln (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). This characteristic “NDQ” motif is unlike the motifs
of proton pumps, which are DTD in bacteriorhodopsin and DTE in the
eubacterial rhodopsins.21 In D.
donghaensis, the expression of the protein with the NDQ motif
was reported to be highly sensitive to Na+ concentration.16 The protein (labeled DDR2) in the presence of
Na+ produced light-induced pH changes that were not abolished
but rather enhanced by CCCP, an ionophore that increases membrane
permeability for protons. This indicated that proton uptake is a secondary
event caused by the primary Na+ transport.15 As one might expect, the photocycle reactions of DDR2 were
sensitive to Na+ concentration.22 A functional study of a similar protein KR2 from Krokinobacter
eikastus(17) uncovered several similar
and additional features. The most important are as follows. (i) Ilumination
of Krokinobacter cells or Escherichia coli cells with KR2 protein expressed caused alkalinization of the medium
in the presence of NaCl, which was eliminated by TPP, a membrane-penetrating
cation, indicating that Na+ transport is electrogenic.
(ii) In the absence of NaCl (which was replaced by KCl), light-induced
acidification was observed, which was eliminated in turn by CCCP,
indicating that in the absence of Na+ the protein can function
as a proton pump.17 (iii) The absorption
maximum was not affected by Na+ (as compared with K+), but the rate of photocycle turnover was greater in the
presence of this cation. Evidence of the interaction of Na+ with the protein in the initial state was obtained from FTIR bands
that appeared in the initial state upon addition of NaCl, with a dissociation
constant Kd of 11.4 mM.17 (iv) Mutations of the carboxyl residues near the Schiff
base (Asp116 and Asp251), as well as mutation of Arg109, eliminated
both Na+ and H+ transport, suggesting that they
share common elements of the transport mechanism. On the other hand,
some mutations that eliminated the FTIR bands that arose upon Na+ binding did not eliminate Na+ transport.

In this work, we report on a similar retinal protein from G. limnaea, abbreviated GLR, which transports Na+ only. We present evidence of a high-affinity Na+ binding
site that is formed transiently during the photocycle. We show that
proton and Na+ transfer reactions are in competition: Na+ inhibits H+ uptake and release from the bulk,
whereas lowering the pH, inhibits the sodium ion dependence of reactions
of the photocycle. Evidence of the involvement of the Schiff base
counterion region in Na+ binding was obtained: we found
that unlike in the wild-type protein, in the D251E mutant (Asp251
being the homologue of Asp212 in bacteriorhodopsin) Na+ binds in the initial state. The binding of Na+ must be
near the counterion to the Schiff base, as inferred from the comparable
effects of Na+ and H+ on the chromophore spectrum.
It should be pointed out that the mechanism of Na+ translocation
and the relationship of the binding of Na+ and H+ have been widely discussed with respect to numerous Na+ pumps that have been investigated, including Na+/K+ ATP-ases,23−28 and constitute a fundamental problem not restricted to the retinal-based
Na+ pumps like GLR. The advantage of retinal proteins as
a model system is that the ion transfer reactions can be initiated
with a pulse of light, and the entire reaction sequence can be followed
spectroscopically, in real time. Further, there is a great deal of
relevant mechanistic background in other versions of such proteins
that function as pumps for protons6,20,29−34 and for chloride ions.35,36

Materials and Methods
The gene of GLR encoded Gilli_234019 was expressed in outer membrane protease-deficient E. coli strain UT5600. Overnight cultures of E. coli bearing
the GLR gene were grown in LB (Luria-Bertani) medium (Fisher Scientific
Inc.) in the presence of 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 30 °C.
Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Zymo Research) and 10 μM all-trans-retinal (Sigma). Cells were harvested 3 h after induction.
Cell membranes were prepared by sonication as described previously37 and solubilized with 1% DDM. The six-His-tagged
protein was purified on a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). GLR was
eluted with 0.02% DDM and washed from imidazole and buffers by overnight
dialysis in Spectra/Por moleculaporous membrane tubing (Spectrum Laboratories,
Inc.) at 4 °C while being gently stirred in a solution containing
10 mM KCl and 1 mM buffer (pH 8). For further washing from salts,
0.5 mL Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (Ultracel 30K, Merck
Millipore Ltd.) were used.

Light-induced pH changes in the suspension
of E. coli cells were measured as described previously.9,38 For
pH measurements, 30 mL of a cell suspension was washed four times
by sedimenting at 3000g for 10 min and resuspending
in an unbuffered salt solution (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 mM KCl), with intervals of several hours between washes
to allow exchange of ions inside the cell with the bulk. In a similar
way, replacement of 100 mM NaCl with 100 mM KCl was done by washing
cells in 100 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2.

All mutants
were generated from a plasmid containing the wild-type
GLR gene using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent
Technologies). Absorption spectra and their pH dependence were measured
as previously described.38 The samples
typically contained 0.02–0.1% DDM and one or several buffers
(citric acid, MES, MOPS, BICINE, HEPES, CHES, and CAPS). Fitting of
titration curves in which the absorption maximum is plotted versus
the ion concentration assumes the existence of two species with different
maxima, with the intermediate maxima being proportional to the extent
of interconversion between the species. The difference spectra from
the same data, a more rigorous parameter, yielded very similar titration
curves and fits. Transient absorption changes during the photocycle
were examined on a single-beam laser photometer as described previously.9,38 Kinetics of light-induced proton release and uptake was assayed
with pH sensitive dye pyranine, as described previously.34 Excitation was produced with 532 nm, 7 ns laser
flashes, with an appropriate duration between flashes (2–12
s). The kinetic traces were fit with FitExp.39

Samples for FTIR were prepared by drying the DDM-solubilized
protein40 on a CaF2 window.
Drying was estimated
to increase the concentration by a factor of ∼30. Thus, the
final concentration of DDM was ∼3%. For measurement at low
Na+ concentrations, the samples were dried with a solution
containing ∼30 nM NaCl (pH 8.6) (estimate from the number of
repetitive washes). For high-Na+ conditions, the liquid
sample was in 5 mM NaCl and reached 150 mM in the dried film. After
being dried and rehumidified to approximately 80% relative humidity,
the samples were sealed with a second CaF2 window. The
FTIR spectra were measured for the phototrapped state formed at the
end of the photocycle, using either continuous illumination by a lamp/filter/waveguide
combination at 500 ± 20 nm41 or 10
Hz flashes from a 532 nm laser (MiniLite-2 by Continuum). Both illumination
regimes allowed trapping of transients decaying slower than ∼1
s and gave essentially the same result. The spectra were recorded
on a Bruker IFS 66/S FTIR spectrometer at 2 cm–1 resolution for a 20 min on/off illumination, averaging four to eight
cycles. Correspondence with measurements in solubilized samples was
confirmed for each sample by measuring the kinetics of the photocycle
of the films in the visible range.

Results
Na+-Dependent Light-Induced pH Changes Produced by
GLR in a Cell Suspension: Evidence of Electrogenic Na+ Transport
Figure 1 shows light-induced pH changes
produced by GLR expressed in E. coli. Illumination
of the cells in the absence of Na+ (in 100 mM KCl) does
not produce significant pH changes, which suggests that unlike KR2,17 GLR does not transport protons, or if there
is such transport it is extremely weak. In 100 mM NaCl, the light-induced
increase in pH is observed, and it is not abolished by CCCP as in
the H+ pumps, BR,42 XR,9 or ESR,38 but is enhanced
by this proton conductor. This indicates that the light-induced alkalinization
is from passive H+ uptake in response to the active electrogenic
transport of Na+, similar to what was observed for KR2
from Krokinobacter,17 and
the main difference from KR2 is that the latter transports protons
in the absence of Na+ whereas in GLR no such activity is
seen. The light-induced pH changes were suppressed by 10 mM TPP (not
shown), a membrane penetrant cation, confirming the electrogenic nature
of the Na+ transport, as in KR2.17 These are the same kind of observations that had identified halorhodopsin
as a light-driven pump not for protons but for chloride ions.10

coli cells with G. limnaea rhodopsin expressed
and reconstituted
with all-trans-retinal: trace 1, absence of pH change
in sodium free medium [in 100 mM KCl (pH 7.5)]; trace 2, proton uptake
(alkalinization) in 100 mM NaCl; trace 3, same as trace 2 but after
addition of a protonophore (50 μM CCCP), which increases the
rate and extent of passive proton influx.

Photocycle of GLR in the Absence of Na+
At low
concentrations of Na+ (≤1 μM), the
turnover of the GLR photocycle is very slow (Figure 2): the absorption changes produced by flash illumination relax
fully after ∼8 s. The first detected intermediate is a red-shifted
photoproduct, which in analogy with BR and other retinal proteins
can be called K. Its relaxation back to the initial state involves
at least six or seven distinctive transitions. In &lt;6 μs,
a fraction of K is replaced by a blue-shifted, M-like intermediate
(see the increase in absorbance at 410 nm and the simultaneous decrease
in absorbance at 550 and 590 nm). The absorption maximum of this state
is at or below 400 nm, which suggests that the retinal Schiff base
is deprotonated. It accumulates in only small amounts, as in other
eubacterial rhodopsins.31,38,43 In the subsequent transition, with a time constant of ∼60
μs, an intermediate absorbing at ∼470 nm is formed (X470). This state and M may be in equilibrium. In KR2, an equilibrium
between L and M had been suggested,17 but
we find that the intermediate in question arises after M, rather than
before as L would. In the following steps, these two blue-shifted
intermediates decay to a red-shifted species that we tentatively identify
as an N-like state [see the increase in absorbance at 550 and 590
nm with time constants at 2.7 and 274 ms, the latter coincident with
the major component in M decay (see the 410 nm trace)]. The last two
transitions involve a strongly red-shifted intermediate (O-like) that
arises in 1 s and decays with a time constant of 2.6 s (Figure 2, 590 nm trace), which determines the rate of recovery
of the initial state (Figure 2, 510 nm trace).
As shown below, this intermediate contains a reisomerized but distorted
all-trans-retinal, as O of BR. The formation of the
M-like intermediate and its decay to the N intermediate slow in D2O by ∼2.5- and ∼8-fold, respectively, consistent
with deprotonation and reprotonation of the Schiff base during these
steps, and the movement of protons limiting the rates.

at several characteristic wavelengths, 410, 510, 550, and 590 nm.
The concentration of NaCl is &lt;1 μM. The traces were globally
fit with six kinetic components with time constants shown at the top.

Na+ Dependence
of the GLR Photocycle
The
rise or decay of the photocycle intermediates, if they are dependent
on the bulk Na+ concentration, can serve as intrinsic reporters
of transient Na+ binding. We gained insight into the dynamics
of sodium ion transport and the possible location of the principal
binding site by exploring the Na+ concentration dependence
of the photocycle transitions monitored at characteristic wavelengths
(Figure 3A). It appears that addition of 0.1,
1, and 3 mM NaCl progressively replaces the slowly forming and slowly
decaying red-shifted (O-like) intermediate with a rapidly rising and
decaying O-like intermediate (Figure 3A, traces
2–4, respectively) and shortens the lifetime of the M state
by linearly increasing the rate constant of its decay (Figure 3B). The existence of two parallel pathways is evident
from traces 2 and 3 of Figure 3A, which show
that the rapid and slow O intermediates coexist. We refer to the two
cycles as “Na+-dependent” and “Na+-independent”, respectively. The transition from the
Na+-independent photocycle to the Na+-dependent
photocycle is best characterized by the pH dependence of the yield
of the long-lived O-like intermediate assayed as absorption changes
at 590 nm (Figure 3C). The data can be fit
by a simple equation derived from a scheme for the photocycle that
branches at M, where some of the molecules in the blue-shifted intermediates
M and X470 undergo transitions to the red-shifted intermediates.
The time constants are k0 and kb[Na+] for the Na+-independent
and Na+-dependent branches, respectively, where kb is the rate constant for Na+ binding
in M. This leads to the following equation: ΔA590 = ΔA0/(1 + K[Na+]), where ΔA590 is the maximal amplitude of the absorption change at 590
nm for the long-lived O intermediate, K = kb/k0, and ΔA0 is the ΔA590 in the absence of Na+. The concentration of Na+ at which the level of accumulation of the long-lived O intermediate
is decreased by half is ∼60 μM (Figure 3C). We note that the value of 60 μM is not the equilibrium
binding constant for Na+, but the Na+ concentration
at which the photocycle branching is at its midpoint. Its relatively
low value indicates a high affinity of the transiently formed binding
site for sodium. Further additions of NaCl not only completely eliminate
the long-lived O intermediate but also continue to accelerate the
decay of the blue-shifted intermediate M and the corresponding formation
of the red-shifted state(s), N/O (Figure 3A,
traces 5–8). The rate of M decay is accelerated by 3 orders
of magnitude in 100 mM NaCl and continues to accelerate up to 1 M
Na+ (latter not shown). The linear dependence of the rate
of its conversion on Na+ concentration (Figure 3B) indicates that entry of Na+ into a
transiently formed binding site, which arises during the photocycle,
becomes rate-limiting. The subsequent reactions of the photocycle
are similarly affected (Figure 3A).

chloride on the kinetics of the GLR photocycle
at two selected wavelengths, 590 nm, representing formation and decay
of the red-shifted intermediate(s) K and O, and 410 nm, tracking the
blue-shifted intermediate(s) M. (A) Traces 1–8 are the absorption
changes at 0.3 μM, 100 μM, 300 μM, 1 mM, 3 mM, 10
mM, 30 mM, and 100 mM NaCl. (B) Rate constant of the decay of the
blue-shifted intermediate vs NaCl concentration (in a single-component
fit; k0 is reciprocal of the half-decay
time at 410 nm at 0.3 μM NaCl). (C) Decrease in the amplitude
of absorption changes at 590 nm from the long-lived O-like intermediate
(time constant of 2.6 s) upon addition of NaCl, which indicates a
switch from a “Na+-independent” to a “Na+-dependent” photocycle. The data were fit with the
equation ΔA590([Na+])
= ΔA0/(1 + K[Na+]) (see the text), from which it was determined that the Na+ concentration at which 50% of the molecules proceed through
the sodium ion-dependent cycle is K–1 = 60 ± 7 μM.

Transitions in the Na+-Dependent Photocycle
The
recovery of the initial state in 100 mM NaCl is ∼50-fold
faster than in the Na+-independent cycle (∼50 ms
vs 2.6 s). To better resolve the rapid early steps involving the formation
of M and X470, we used D2O instead of H2O, which slows them by a factor of ∼2.5. Subsequent
stages are less affected. In 100 mM NaCl, the kinetics of M decay
in D2O slows by &lt;1.4-fold, much lower than the value
of 8-fold in the absence of Na+, suggesting that binding
of a sodium ion facilitates reprotonation of the Schiff base in the
M to N transition and determines its rate. Figure 4A shows the kinetics at selected wavelengths. In panels B–D,
the spectra of the initial (first) absorption changes produced by
light (labeled Initial) and the seven subsequent kinetic steps obtained
from a global fit are shown. The spectra, given here as differences
between consecutive intermediates, represent conversion of each intermediate
state into the next. In the first transition (τ1 =
7.7 μs), a fraction (∼30%) of K with a maximum at 550
nm is replaced by the short wavelength M-like intermediate, with a
maximum at ≤400 nm. In the subsequent step (τ2 = 48 μs), most of the remaining K is replaced by X470. In the third step (τ3 = 124 μs), the M-like
state and the rest of K disappear and a red-shifted species (maximum
in the difference spectrum is at 550 nm) is produced. The fourth and
fifth steps involve transitions of the X470 intermediate
with τ4 = 0.9 ms and τ5 = 4.3 ms
into species designated as N and O, with maxima in the difference
absorption spectra at 570 and 600 nm, respectively. The initial state
is recovered in the sixth and seventh kinetic steps with τ6 = 12 ms and τ7 = 54 ms through decay of
O. The Na+-dependent and Na+-independent cycles
differ therefore mainly in the time constants of the interconversions.
The mixtures of species associated with single kinetic steps arise
most likely from back reactions that produce transient equilibria
of several states, as in other retinal proteins.44−48

Light-Induced pH Changes
in the Suspension of GLR
We
measured the kinetics of transient H+ concentration changes
in the bulk after flash photoexcitation, using pyranine as a pH sensitive
probe.34,49 The increase in absorbance at 455 nm from
the dye (after subtraction of the trace from a sample without the
dye) corresponds to proton uptake, whereas a decrease indicates proton
release. As shown in Figure 5A, in the absence
of Na+, formation of the intermediate M, with two time
constants of 35 μs (60%) and 150 μs (40%), is followed
by proton release with a time constant of ∼2 ms. The decay
of M and the formation of N/O-like states, with τ ≈ 400
ms, virtually coincide with the uptake of protons (that reverses the
earlier release and causes net alkalinization of the bulk). At the
end of the cycle, the decay of the long-lived O state with τ
= 2.7 s is accompanied by a coincident release (with τ = 2.6
± 0.1 s) of the net proton gained earlier during the decay of
M and formation of N/O.

Figure 5 Light-induced pH changes produced by GLR assayed
with pyranine
(pH 7.2–7.4). (A) In 100 mM KCl: 1, pyranine response; 2, ΔA at 410 nm; 3, ΔA at 590 nm. Proton
release occurs with two time constants, 0.7 and 9.9 ms; the subsequent
proton uptake with one (430 ms) and slow release one (2.6 ± 0.1
s). The decay of M (ΔA at 410 nm) and the rise
of the red-shifted intermediate (ΔA at 590
nm) occurred with a time constant of 400 ms, similar to that of H+ uptake. The decay of ΔA at 590 nm
occurs with a time constant of 2.7 s, similar to that of slow proton
release. (B) In 100 mM NaCl: 1, pyranine response; 2, ΔA at 410 nm; 3, ΔA at 450 nm; 4,
ΔA at 590 nm. Proton release occurs with a
time constant of ∼1 ms and uptake with a time constant of 50
ms. (C) Comparison of the pyranine response in 100 mM KCl and 100
mM NaCl. A decrease in pyranine absorbance corresponds to proton release.

In the presence of 100 mM NaCl,
the movement of protons into and
out of the protein, and especially its relationship to the decay of
M and the formation of the red-shifted N/O intermediate(s), is quite
different (Figure 5B). The proton uptake that
correlates with formation of the red-shifted species in the absence
of NaCl is missing in 100 mM NaCl (Figure 5C). Instead, proton release and uptake occur with kinetics similar
to those of the rise and decay of the O-like intermediate, respectively
(Figure 5B). Together with the Na+ dependence of the rate of N/O formation (Figure 3A), this suggests that in the Na+-dependent cycle
Na+ eliminates the need for H+ uptake in the
formation of this species, probably by substitution of H+ at the counterion. However, decay of M must include reprotonation
of the Schiff base, in spite of a proton being released to the bulk
at the same time. Thus, the H+ for the reprotonation is
likely to originate from inside the protein, and in that case, Na+ binding is associated with acceleration of this internal
proton transfer.

FTIR Evidence of Protonation of a Carboxylate
Residue in the
Absence of Na+ but Not in Its Presence
FTIR spectra
measured under photostationary conditions at 270 K (Figures 6) revealed that the phototrapped state(s) are O-like.
The ethylenic stretch frequency at 1523 cm–1 indicates
that this state is red-shifted by ∼76 nm (from the ethylenic
to λmax correlation), consistent with the strongly
red-shifted O state observed in the visible range. The HOOP band at
955 cm–1 and the pattern in the fingerprint region
(1150–1270 cm–1) indicate that the chromophore
is in a distorted all-trans conformation like the
O state of bacteriorhodopsin. Shifts in the amide I (1630–1680
cm–1) and amide II (at 1552 cm–1) bands, comparable to those in the N state of BR,50,51 indicate strong conformational perturbation of the protein.

Figure 6 Light minus
dark FTIR spectra of photostationary states at 270
K: spectrum 1, in the absence
of NaCl (&lt;1 μM); spectrum 2, in 150 mM NaCl (pH8.6). The
ethylenic stretch, the fingerprint, and the HOOP regions of spectra
in the infrared and the corresponding spectra in the visible range
of the same samples (not shown) indicate that the intermediate trapped
is like the O state of bacteriorhodopsin. The Na+ dependence
of the C=O stretch region is discussed in the text.

The spectra for samples with and without NaCl are
nearly the same
between 900 and 1665 cm–1. The main difference is
in the region of 1665–1750 cm–1, where the
C=O stretch bands of protonated carboxyls of Asp and Glu and
the side chain C=O stretch bands of Asn and Gln are found.52 The frequency below 1700 cm–1 is usually considered to be too low for the carbonyl vibrations53,54 of Asp or Glu. The spectrum with NaCl, but not the spectrum without
NaCl, contains a triple band at 1700/1689/1673 cm–1 indicating, most probably, a perturbation of the side chain C=O
stretch of Asn or Gln. For example, a shift from 1700 to 1689 cm–1 would be consistent with a Na+ coordinated
by a side chain C=O group, e.g., from Asn112 near the Schiff
base. In the absence of NaCl, the negative band at 1700 cm–1 disappears and the magnitude of the positive band at 1689 cm–1 is decreased, but a positive carboxylic C=O
stretch band of Asp/Glu at 1734 cm–1 appears instead.
The appearance of a new band in this region indicates that in the
absence of Na+ a carboxylate becomes protonated.53,55 This band, however, seems to be too wide to originate from a single
protonated COOH stretching vibration, which on average has a line
width of 10–15 cm–1.55 The complex band might be due either to protonation of two (or more)
carboxylates or, more probably, to the protonated C=O stretch
of a single carboxyl that is present in two or more red-shifted (sub)states
at the end of the photocycle. The latter is in accord with the visible
kinetics and time-resolved IR measurements of the films: both indicate
the presence of more than one red-shifted transient state at the end
of the photocycle (not shown). The position of the band at 1734 cm–1 is similar to that of the protonated Asp115 band
in BR,56 which is hydrogen-bonded to a
threonine.57,58 Assignment of the C=O
stretch band(s), using the D116E and D251E mutants, is underway, but
their photocycles are greatly changed. Importantly, the protonation
of an anionic carboxylate group in the O-like state in the absence
of Na+, but not in its presence, correlates to the observation
of net proton uptake during the formation of this intermediate under
the same conditions (Figure 5) and may account
for one of the protons taken up.

pH Dependence of the GLR
Photocycle in NaCl: Correlation with
the Protonation State of the Counterion and Its Competition with the
Na+-Independent Pathway
Between pH 7.0 and 8.5,
no significant pH dependence in the photocycle reactions is seen in
the presence of 100 mM NaCl. However, at lower pH, the amplitudes
of transient changes at all three characteristic wavelengths that
reflect M rise and decay (410 nm), N/O rise and decay (590 nm), and
depletion of the initial state (510 nm) decrease (Figure 7). This decrease correlates with a decrease in the
fraction of initial GLR with a deprotonated counterion, as follows
from the titration curve in Figure 8B. At pH
6.1 and especially pH 5.1, M decay is slowed in the same way as when
the concentration of Na+ is lowered and the long-lived
O intermediate from the “Na+-independent”
cycle appears, providing evidence of the competition of H+ and Na+ in diverting the photocycle into the “Na+-independent” and “Na+-dependent”
pathways, respectively. At pH 3.5, where the counterion is expected
to be nearly fully protonated (see below), both M and O are absent,
as in bacteriorhodopsin at acidic pH.

Evidence That Asp116 and Asp251 Are Components of the Counterion
to the Schiff Base: pH-Dependent Transitions in Wild-Type GLR and
Its D116N and D251N Mutants
The absorption band of GLR exhibits
a maximum at ∼520 nm at pH 8.0 (Figure 8A, spectrum 1). The maximum shows a strong pH dependence as in many
other bacterial rhodopsins. Lowering the pH to 3.0 causes a shift
to ∼550 nm (Figure 8A and Figure S2
of the Supporting Information). There is
very little difference between the titration curves in 100 mM KCl
and 100 mM NaCl (Figure 8B), as reported for
KR2.17 The absorption changes with a maximum
of ∼580 nm in the difference spectrum (shown in Figure 8C) can be described with a minimum of two transitions,
with apparent pKa values of 6.7 and 4.5
(Figure 8B), suggesting the presence of at
least two ionizable residues that affect the chromophore absorption
band. A large red shift at low pH in the microbial retinal proteins
is a common indicator of the protonation of the counterion to the
Schiff base. Interestingly, the absorption changes that are observed
in pH titration of GLR (Figure 8C, spectrum
1) coincide with the absorption changes accompanying the decay of
the red-shifted O intermediate into the initial state in the Na+-independent and Na+-dependent photocycles (Figure 8C, spectra 4 and 5, respectively). In GLR, the homologue
of Asp85 in bacteriorhodopsin is an asparagine, and one would expect
that this protein would exhibit a strongly red-shifted spectrum as
the D85N mutant of BR59 or ESR.38 As shown in Figure 8A,
this is not so. The most likely reason is that the aspartic acid residue
in GLR (and KR2) located a helical turn (four residues) downstream,
in place of Thr89 in BR, is apparently able to function as part of
the Schiff base counterion. Indeed, substitution of this residue,
Asp116, with asparagine causes a large (52 nm) red shift of the spectrum,
to 572 nm, at neutral pH (Figure 8A, spectrum
3). Replacement of the second aspartate near the Schiff base, Asp251,
the homologue of Asp212 in BR, conserved in all pumps, with Asn causes
a smaller (14 nm) red shift to 534 nm at pH 8.0 (Figure 8A, spectrum 4). With a decrease in pH, the D251N mutant exhibits
an additional 14 nm red shift (Figure 8D, curve
3), apparently from protonation of Asp116. As expected, at pH ≤4.0
the maximum of D251N matches that of the wild type (Figure 8D).

At high pH (&gt;8.5), where the counterion
is fully deprotonated, the absorption maximum of wild-type GLR is
not affected by an increase in NaCl concentration from essentially
zero (5 μM) to 3 M (data not shown), suggesting that GLR does
not bind Na+ in the unphotolyzed state, consistent with
the observation (Figure 8B) that the titration
is nearly unaffected by replacing NaCl with KCl. At lower pH, however,
addition of salt (NaCl or KCl) causes a blue shift in the absorption
maximum, by affecting either surface pH or the pKa of protonation of the counterion (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). A divalent cation is
more efficient than monovalent cations (see a comparison of the effects
of Mg2+ and NaCl at pH 6.6 in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information), suggesting that the
salt effects originate from the increased level of shielding of surface
charges at the higher ionic strengths. Under these conditions, the
surface concentration of cations would approach that in the bulk,
shifting the observed pKa toward its actual
value, as in BR.60,61An alternative model would contain
a nonspecific low-affinity cation binding site, probably near the
protein surface, which would affect the pKa of the counterion.

The behavior of the D116N mutant is somewhat
surprising. As mentioned
above, in BR the absorption maximum in the mutant of the Schiff base
counterion D85N62 (615 nm) is strongly
red-shifted at neutral pH compared to that of the wild type (560 nm).59 If Asp116 is the main part of the counterion,
it might have been expected that D116N be red-shifted also and show
a smaller additional red shift as the pH is lowered, from protonation
of the other part of the counterion, Asp251. The absorption maximum
of D116N is indeed red-shifted relative to that of the wild type at
high pH, but the red shift is much greater than what would be expected
from the total red shift in the wild type when the counterion charge
is eliminated at low pH. With a decrease in pH, D116N shows a 25 nm
blue shift, with a pKa of ∼4.8,
and at pH 4.0, its maximum roughly matches the maximum of the wild
type. Three factors could contribute to this unexpected blue shift
at low pH: (i) binding of chloride ions upon protonation of Asp251,
as in BR at low pH63,64 and in its D85N mutant where
a blue shift was also observed at pH &lt;5,59 (ii) protonation of an unidentified acidic residue, possibly Glu160,
which in GLR is near the ionone ring of the retinal, and (iii) pH-dependent
thermal isomerization of the retinal in D116N that favors isomers
other than the all-trans form. We examined the effect
of chloride at low pH, and while the blue shift is smaller (by ∼30%)
in the absence of chloride, it is not eliminated (not shown). Protonation
of Glu160, a residue in GLR near the retinal ionone ring, would be
expected to cause a blue shift, but the titration of the E160Q mutant
did not exhibit a significant difference from that of the wild type
(not shown), ruling out this possibility. The retinal isomeric composition
does appear to change at low pH: the long wavelength component of
its band decreases with a decrease in pH, whereas the short wavelength
β-bands increase (data not shown), which is characteristic for
a transition of trans-retinal to other isomers.65 Wild-type GLR is stable in DDM at pH ≥3.0;
the D116N mutant exhibits signs of instability below pH 3.5, but this
cannot account for the observed blue shift between pH 6.0 and 4.0,
which appears to be from a combination of Cl– binding
and chromophore isomerization.

As shown by the large red shifts
and the blue shifts in D116N at
various pH values, the titrations of the wild type and the D116N and
D251N mutants do suggest that Asp116 and Asp251 are both ionized at
pH 8.0 and together constitute the counterion to the Schiff base.
Moreover, the titration curve can be fit assuming interaction (coupling)
of the protonation states of these two residues in such a way that
protonation of one decreases the pKa of
the other by ∼2 pH units.

Binding of H+ and Na+ in the D251E Mutant
in the Unphotolyzed State
This mutant at neutral pH exhibits
a red-shifted maximum compared to that of the wild type, 562 nm (Figure 9A, spectrum 1), which implies that the counterion
is protonated. Indeed, at higher pH, the absorption band undergoes
a 28 nm blue shift to 534 nm (with the titration largely complete
at pH 10.6), indicating deprotonation of the counterion (Figure 9A, spectrum 3). In 100 mM KCl, the pKa of this transition is 8.8 (Figure 9B, curve 1). In contrast, in 100 mM NaCl, the blue shift at high
pH is much smaller, only 7 nm (Figure 9B, curve
2). Titration in 10 mM NaCl is accompanied by a larger shift (Figure 9B, curve 3), but smaller than in 100 mM KCl. In
the wild type, the pH dependence was similar in KCl and NaCl except
for a small (∼2 nm) blue shift in 100 mM KCl (Figures 8B and 9B). The different
effects of KCl and NaCl are further illustrated by the absorption
changes in panels C and D of Figure 9. Addition
of 10 mM NaCl to a sample with a deprotonated counterion at pH 10.3
and a low ionic strength (3 mM KCl) causes absorption changes virtually
identical to those that are caused by an increase in proton concentration
(Figure 9C). Via the addition of more NaCl,
the blue shift caused by the increase in pH from 7 to 10.3 can be
largely reversed by Na+ as shown in Figure 9D. The apparent binding constant for Na+ at this
pH is ∼2 mM. It appears that Na+ ions can substitute
for protons and bind to the counterion in the initial state of the
D251E mutant, causing the red shift of the absorption spectrum.

pH dependence of the absorption maximum of the D251E mutant (curves

NaCl, (3) 10 mM NaCl, (4) 100 mM NaCl, and (5) 100 mM KCl. (C) Absorption
changes produced by (1) binding of H+ with a decrease in
pH from 10.4 to 9.7 in 3 mM KCl, (2) addition of 10 mM NaCl to 3 mM
KCl at pH 9.7, and (3) subsequent addition of 20 mM KCl (note that
the latter change is the opposite of the others). (D) Red shift of
the absorption maximum of the D251E mutant produced by the addition
of NaCl at pH 10.3 (in the presence of 3 mM KCl). Such a shift does
not occur in the WT under the same conditions.

As the wild type, the mutant shows also nonspecific salt
effects
on the absorption maximum (Figure S4 of the Supporting
Information) and apparent pKa.
Compared to low-salt conditions (1 mM KCl and buffer only), 100 mM
KCl causes a distinct shift of the pKa to a lower value (Figure S5 of the Supporting
Information). As in the wild type (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information), the origin of the KCl
effect must be that it screens charged groups on the surface of the
protein. This effect is not specific to a particular cation, and as
in the wild type, a divalent cation (Mg2+) is more efficient,
as in BR. If K+ and Mg2+ act by binding to a
distinct binding site at the surface or in a more buried location,
this site would be additional to that which binds Na+ selectively.
We interpret the specific effect of Na+ in the D251E mutant
as follows. In D251E, Na+ and H+ bind competitively
with one another. Na+ binds to, or near, the anionic counterion,
and then its charge replaces the charge of H+: Asp-H ↔
Asp– ↔ Asp-Na. The designation “Asp”
simply indicates that the binding site contains an ionizable residue,
i.e., at Asp116 and/or Asp251. This model yields a simple formula
for the titration of the counterion with H+ and Na+. The fraction of the ionized (unbound) counterion, Fu, depends on both H+ and Na+ concentrations: 1  where KNa is the ratio of the rate constants of Na+ dissociation
and association at the binding site (KNa = kd/ka).
The fraction of the red-shifted species with a neutralized counterion
(the sum of protonated and sodium ion-bound species) (Fb = FbH+ + FbNa+) is equal
to 1 – Fu. This formula describes
the titration curves in the presence of Na+ shown in Figure 9B and the red shift upon addition of NaCl to the
protein with a deprotonated counterion (Figure 9D). Fits of the data in panels B and D of Figure 9 with this model yield the pKa and KNa. Both are apparent and depend
on salt concentration, changing in concert, indicating that the capability
to bind H+ and Na+ is similarly affected by
salt concentration from its shielding of surface charges. Thus, in
100 mM KCl, the values of pKa and KNa are 8.8 and 20 mM, changed from 9.8 and 2
mM in 3 mM KCl, respectively.

Discussion
Titration
experiments (Figure 8B) indicate
that the resting state of wild-type GLR does not appear to bind a
cation other than H+ at the Schiff base. This observation
hints at the possibility that Na+ transport is different
from H+ transport in bacteriorhodopsin, where the transported
ion is bound to the Schiff base before photoexcitation.

A High-Affinity
Binding Site for Na+ Is Transiently
Formed in the GLR Photocycle
In GLR, the transported ion,
Na+, binds during the photocycle. The observed linear Na+ dependence of the rate constants of some of the photocycle
transitions (Figure 3) leads to three conclusions.
(i) The absorption changes identify two parallel reaction sequences
that diverge after a branching point in the cycle. The switch from
a slow “Na+-independent” to a rapid “Na+-dependent” photocycle occurs at a Na+ concentration
of 60 μM, which demonstrates that a high-affinity Na+ binding site is formed in the M intermediate state and possibly
the X470 intermediate state. The discovery of a high-affinity
binding site formed transiently during the photocycle is important
for the functioning of GLR as an electrogenic generator. The magnitude
of the light-induced electrochemical gradient created by a pump is
limited by the difference in the pK for binding of
an ion during uptake and the pK for release. The
higher the former and the lower the latter, the larger the difference,
and the pump will function against greater gradients. The virtually
complete lack of binding in the initial (and therefore the final)
state of the cycle state ensures full Na+ release, and
the transient binding with high affinity during the transport cycle
ensures efficient operation at relatively low (submillimolar) concentrations
for the light-driven sodium pumps. Further, the lack of binding in
the initial state prevents the leakage of Na+ through the
pump when it is not photoactivated. (ii) Na+ is captured
from the bulk during the lifetime of the M to N transition, and this
remains the limiting step in the photocycle at Na+ concentrations
of at least 1 M. (iii) The results suggest that the likely site for
Na+ binding that arises transiently in the photocycle is
the Schiff base–counterion region because (a) formation of
the red-shifted intermediate is expected to reflect neutralization
of a negative charge in the vicinity of the protonated Schiff base
either by H+ (in the “Na+-independent”
cycle) or by Na+ (in the “Na+-dependent”
cycle) and (b) protonation of the counterion at low pH eliminates
the characteristic features of the Na+-dependent cycle.
This conclusion does not necessarily exclude an additional, transient
cytoplasmic binding site if it functions as a rapid donor of Na+ to the central binding site. The conclusion that the counterion
is the site at which Na+ binds is supported by the properties
of the D251E mutant. Perturbation of the Schiff base region in this
mutant (Asp251 being the homologue of Asp212 in BR) creates a Na+ binding site in the unphotolyzed state. As shown in Figure 9, shifts of the retinal absorption maximum in titration
experiments indicate that Na+ binds at the counterion when
it is anionic. The location of Na+ must be near the location
of where H+ binds because (a) the difference spectra for
the binding of the two ions agree (Figure 9C) and thus at saturating Na+ concentrations the red shift
of the maximum is as great as with protonation of the counterion and
(b) Na+ binds only when the counterion is anionic.

The implication of the results with D251E is that the Schiff base
region has the potential to bind Na+ in its vicinity. Perturbation
of this region in the D251E mutant and from the changed shape of the
photoisomerized retinal66 and/or any ensuing
electrostatic changes in the wild type could be similar and create
a binding site for Na+. We propose that the key factor
in creating such a site during the wild-type photocycle is a large
increase in the pKa of the counterion,
as in BR,67,68 the consequence of retinal isomerization
and cleavage of the salt bridge between the Schiff base and the counterion
in M.69 The affinity for Na+ will change in parallel to the affinity for protons (as follows
from titration of the D251E mutant). With the higher affinities, binding
of Na+ to the counterion will occur at concentrations of
tens of micromolar. Reisomerization and re-formation of the salt bridge
at the end of the photocycle would restore the initial low pKa of the counterion and “push”
the bound Na+ to the extracellular side, in the same way
as the proton is ejected from the counterion in bacteriorhodopsin
during O decay.70−73 In Na+ pumps, such a creation of the binding site must
be combined with optimization of the geometry of the site for sodium
ion binding, which in contrast to H+, is usually coordinated
not by a single group but by five to six atoms,27,74 which can be provided by Asp116, Asp251, Asn112, and any bound water.

A Tentative Scheme of Transitions To Account for the Observed
Uptake and Release of Proton and Sodium Ion in the Photocycle
Taking advantage of the considerable body of mechanistic information
from bacteriorhodopsin and similar proteins, we propose a minimal
scheme that is consistent with all the data (Figure 10). We need to assume three sites: the retinal Schiff base,
a counterion that is also part of a binding site for H+ and Na+, and an additional site for H+ that
could be analogous to the extracellular proton release site of BR.49,68,75,76 A model with fewer sites cannot be reconciled with the observations.
The first steps in the photocycle do not depend on Na+.
For the K state of KR2, this was explicitly shown.77 M formation is very rapid, on a time scale of a few microseconds,
suggesting the existence of a ready acceptor for the Schiff base proton.
Asp116 and Asp251 are the likely candidates, but a state in which
this could be examined using FTIR spectroscopy could not be trapped.
The initial H+ release occurs at approximately the same
time in the presence and absence of Na+ (Figure 5C). It is delayed compared to M rise (Figure 5A), suggesting that the proton is not directly from
the Schiff base, providing further support for the involvement of
a proton acceptor. This means also that there are two M states: one
before proton release and another after, as in BR.49,68,75

Figure 10 Tentative scheme for internal ion transfer
and binding that accounts
for the observed uptake of H+ from the bulk and its release.
The top surface of the schematic representation of the protein is
the cytoplasmic side. For the sake of clarity, not all detected intermediates
are shown. The top sequence after the branch is the “Na+-independent” cycle and the bottom the “Na+-dependent” cycle. SBH+ and SB refer to
the protonated and unprotonated retinal Schiff base, respectively.
“Asp” refers to the proton acceptor group and the ionizable
part of the Na+ binding site, without commitment as to
whether it is Asp116, Asp251, or both. The dashed circle is a postulated
proton binding site analogous to the proton release site of bacteriorhodopsin,
made necessary by the observation of proton release in the O state
of the Na+-dependent cycle.

In the absence of Na+, the further reactions of
the
photocycle are limited by the rate of reprotonation of the Schiff
base. Reprotonation of the Schiff base to produce the red-shifted
intermediate would be from the counterion, reversing the first proton
transfer, and the counterion itself would then be reprotonated, as
shown by the FTIR spectrum in the absence of Na+ (Figure 6), apparently from the bulk. This accounts for one
of the two protons taken up at this time. The second proton taken
up would reprotonate the vacant release site. Deprotonation of the
counterion and release of this proton at the end of the cycle complete
the recovery of the initial state. Because net translocation of H+ in this system has not been detected (Figure 1), all proton release and uptake are assumed to be from the
same side (extracellular side).

In the presence of Na+, reprotonation of the unprotonated
Schiff base (decay of M) occurs order(s) of magnitude faster and starts
before proton uptake (Figure 5B). Electrostatics
dictates that uptake of Na+ and its binding at the counterion,
which occurs at this time, would accelerate the transfer of the proton
from the counterion to the Schiff base. In this case, the red shift
of the N and O-like intermediates is from the Na+ bound
at the anionic counterion. This conclusion is drawn from (a) the ability
of sodium ion binding to cause a red shift, as demonstrated in the
experiments with D251E, and (b) the large red shift of the absorption
maximum of GLR upon titration to low pH, characteristic of a counterion
protonation, and the good agreement of the difference spectrum of
this red shift with the absorption change that occurs during the last
step of the “Na+-dependent” photocycle (Figures 4D and 8C). In the presence
of NaCl, proton release is coincident with rapid conversion of the
M intermediate to the O intermediate, and an M state with a released
H+ does not accumulate. The released H+ cannot
originate from either the Schiff base or the counterion and must be
from the site that is invoked also for the Na+-dependent
cycle (Figure 10). The protonated state of
the Schiff base and the neutralized counterion will increase the extent
of delocalization of π-electrons in the chromophore to facilitate
its reisomerization.78 Thus, uptake of
the sodium ion to the binding site will correlate with both reprotonation
of the Schiff base and reisomerization of the retinal to the all-trans form (FTIR spectrum in the presence of Na+ shown in Figure 6). The release of the Na+ in the last reaction of the cycle results in restoration
of the salt bridge of the Schiff base with the anionic counterion.
For net Na+ translocation, uptake and release have to be
postulated to take place at the cytoplasmic and extracellular surfaces,
respectively.
