The M2 protein
of influenza-A
is a 97 amino acid protein with one transmembrane domain that forms
homotetramers whose primary function is to conduct protons across
the viral membrane. At the pH of the cytosol, M2 is inefficient for
conducting protons. However, the low pH of the host cells’
endosome activates M2 and acidifies the viral interior by conducting
protons with near perfect selectivity. Although the rate is relatively slow (101–104 s–1), it allows
for unpacking of viral ribonucleoprotein into the host cell., M2 may also play a role in maintaining the high pH of the trans-Golgi
network. A single residue, histidine 37
(His 37), located in the transmembrane region is known to be responsible
for pH activation and selectivity, whereas a second residue, tryptophan
41 (Trp 41), is responsible for unidirectional proton conduction and
is found one helical turn below His 37, both of which are universally
conserved in a variety of functional mutants., M2
has been the subject of investigation since it was discovered to be
the target of adamantyl amine based inhibitors, and the functional
binding site for these drugs was subsequently located in the pore., The most prevalent strains of influenza A have become resistant
to common treatment methods, prompting additional interest in understanding
the structure and function of M2, which could lead to the possibility
of designing alternative small molecule inhibitors with which to treat
this disease.,, The
structure–function relationships of M2 have been studied by
a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction,,, fluorescence imaging, and both solution and magic angle spinning (MAS)
NMR spectroscopies.,,,,

A detailed
understanding of the mechanism of proton conduction
would form a foundation for an understanding of inhibition and resistant
mutation. Historically, two models have been proposed to be responsible
for proton conduction in M2, a water-wire or Grotthuss model and a
shuttle model (transporter model), which may or may not involve a
hydrogen-bonded dimer as an intermediate that could be integral to
its function.,, In the water-wire model, as multiple protons enter the channel,
electrostatic repulsion results in the expansion of the channel’s
diameter, allowing for protons to traverse the channel directly from
one water molecule to another. The water-wire model would likely involve
global changes to the protein structure upon protonation in order
to facilitate proton transfer. In contrast, the shuttle model proceeds
through several steps, beginning with protons entering the channel
and binding to His 37, followed by His 37 ring motion,, which moves the proton from one side of the channel to the other,
and last a deprotonation step that releases the proton on the other
side of the channel. It has also been hypothesized that a hydrogen-bonded
dimer (a state in which one proton is shared between adjacent His
37 residues) forms following initial protonation, based on previous
measurements of His 37 in a transmembrane construct of M2. The shuttle
model predicts that the proton conduction rate is a composite of both
the degree of His 37 protonation and His 37 ring motion.,, In contrast, if the protein were
switched open to form a water wire, then diffusion-limited conductance
would be expected. Unlike the water-wire model, the shuttle model
does not require global changes to the protein structure, although
they may still occur.

Recent X-ray crystallography results from
crystals of the transmembrane
portion of M2 (M2TM) formed at various pH’s found
differences in global protein structure, opening the possibility that
changes in protein structures may occur during proton conduction and
that the proton conduction model could be a combination of the water-wire
and shuttle models. Unfortunately, there is limited information available
to determine the exact mechanism of conduction, stemming from an absence
of structural characterization of M2 at low pH, particularly when
reconstituted in lipids.

The first study examining the protonation
state of His 37 as a
function of pH employing MAS NMR was performed by Cross et al. on
M2TM. By calculating the ratio
of [His]/[HisH+] from the 15N MAS NMR spectrum
as a function of pH, the authors generated a titration curve for His 37, which yielded four pKa’s: 8.2, 8.2, 6.3, and &lt;5. The degenerate pKa of 8.2 was
attributed to cooperative protonation as two protons entered the M2TM channel simultaneously, an unexpected result given the low
dielectric environment of the transmembrane region and the fact that
the pKa of unperturbed histidine in aqueous
solution is 6.2., Hong et al. have also studied
multiple aspects of M2TM by MAS NMR spectroscopy,−, including a detailed examination
of the [His]/[HisH+] of His 37 as a function of pH, which
yielded four distinct pKa’s: 7.6
± 0.1, 6.8 ± 0.1, 4.9 ± 0.3, and 4.2 ± 0.6. Hong et al. attributed the discrepancies between
these two results to different fitting methods and to differences
in the lipids used for reconstituting of the protein, which may impact
protein structure or plasticity. They
also measured the protonation/deprotonation rates of histidine, yielding
an upper bound to the proton conduction rate for a shuttle mechanism,
which was found to be within an order of magnitude of the measured
conduction rate. The shuttle mechanism is therefore consistent with
measured His 37 ring reorientation.,,

While significant attention has been dedicated
to understanding
the model of proton conduction in constructs containing only the transmembrane
portion of M2 (M2TM), which consists of the residues 22–46,
little attention has been devoted to longer constructs, many of which
are fully functional and therefore possess characteristics closer
to those of M2WT than of M2TM with respect to
proton conduction and sensitivity to rimantadine., One such functional construct is M218–60, which
is composed of an unstructured N-terminus (18–23), a TM segment
(25–46), and an amphipathic helix (51–59) at the C-terminus.
The amphipathic helix forms a tetrameric domain separate from the
TM tetramer with a head-to-tail assembly and a right handed packing
mode in NMR structures and is known to stabilize tetramer formation.,,, Importantly, it has been demonstrated that constructs which possess
the amphipathic helix display conductance and sensitivity to rimantadine similar
to that of full-length M2. Therefore, we chose to study the pH behavior
of M218–60.

Conduction properties and high-pH
structural characteristics of
M218–60 have been reported and are briefly described
below. Pielak and Chou recently measured the proton conduction rates
of M218–60 in liposomes as a function of pH, with
the rate of proton conduction found to be inversely proportional to
the pH of the solution with two pseudosaturation regions, one between
pH 7.5 and 5.5 and another at pH &lt; 4. Our group has recently
examined the structure of M218–60 using MAS NMR
spectroscopy and observed doubling of
many of the cross peaks in the spectra of M218–60 constructs of both WT and S31N, consistent with a C2 symmetric quaternary structure of M218–60. In particular, in lipid bilayers, M218–60 adopts
a dimer-of-dimers structure instead of a fully symmetric tetramer,
which would have C4 symmetry. Recently, the dimer-of-dimers structure was
also reported for the closely related M222–62 construct., Recently, a study examining an E3–M2 fusion protein via FRET
in live cells indicated that the E3–M2 dimer forms at high
pH’s, that at low pH’s tetramers are formed, and that
conduction is possible with both dimers and tetramers. We note that
these studies are conducted with a protein to lipid ratio of ∼1:1000,
whereas MAS NMR studies need to be conducted with much lower lipid
concentrations in order for a signal to be observed in a reasonable
period of time.

Since M218–60 is known to
fully reproduce the
conduction and inhibition characteristics of the full-length protein, as described above, and the structure of the
construct is known to be different from that of M2TM for
which His 37 pKa’s have been measured,
we sought to understand the mechanism of proton gating by examining 15N MAS NMR of M218–60 and to probe for any
changes in structure as a function of pH with 13C–13C and 13C–15N correlations.
In our present study, we have examined the H57Y variant to ensure
that only one His is present in the primary sequence and reverse-labeled
Ile, Leu, Phe, and Tyr residues in an effort to provide additional
spectral resolution. Following refolding, the protein was adjusted
to the appropriate pH in glutamate-citrate-phosphate buffer as described
below. A titration curve was generated from the 15N spectra
of His 37 within M218–60 and simulated and surprisingly
yielded only two proton association constants, 7.63 and 4.52. The
plot of fraction of His 37 protonated as a function of pH closely
matched a similar plot with the proton conduction rate measured as
a function of pH, indicating that proton conduction rates are proportional
to the protonation state of His 37, supporting the shuttle model for
proton conduction. Imidazole proton chemical shifts revealed no evidence
for proton sharing among adjacent His 37 residues. Two-dimensional 13C–13C and 13C–15N correlation spectroscopy reveals that as pH is lowered the protein
accesses more conformations and no distinct shift to an open state
is discernible.

Experimental Section
Synthesis and Reconstitution
of U-13C,15N [Natural Abundance-ILFY]M218–60
Preparation
of M218–60 by overexpression in Escherichia
coli has been described previously., Briefly, M218–60 was overexpressed in E. coli BL-21 DE3 as a fusion with trpLE with an
N-terminal His9-tag. Protein synthesis was induced with an IPTG concentration
of 150 μM at an OD600 of 0.75. For reverse labeling,
1 L of M9 culture was divided into two parts. A 700 mL portion was
inoculated and grown to an OD600 of 0.7. Natural abundance
amino acids ILFY (Sigma) were dissolved in the remaining 300 mL and
added to the 700 mL portion, bringing the OD to ∼0.5 prior
to induction at OD600 of 0.75. The culture was induced
for 14–18 h at 18 °C. The protein was purified on a Ni2+ affinity column and cleaved with 0.35 g of cyanogen bromide
in 2.5 mL of 70% formic acid per liter of cell culture. Finally, pure
protein was isolated on a C4 reverse-phase HPLC column.

M2 Bilayer
Preparation
Pure peptide was dispersed in
1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC)
purchased from Avanti. Bilayer samples were prepared by detergent
dialysis. Peptide and lipid were dissolved separately in ∼33
mg per mL of octyl glucopyranoside (OG) detergent (Sigma) and then
combined at a 1:1 (w/w) lipid to protein ratio. Detergent was removed
by dialyzing against 2 L of buffer with two buffer changes per day
using a 3.5 kDa cutoff. Dialysis buffer contained 40 mM phosphate,
30 mM glutamate, and 3 mM sodium azide at pH 7.8. After 5 days of
dialysis, the sample was pelleted by centrifugation at 100 000g. The pellet was suspended in buffer composed of 20 mM
citric acid, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 40 mM glutamic acid, and 3 mM
sodium azide, and the pH was subsequently adjusted to 3.5, 4.5, 5.5,
6.5, 7.5, and 8.5 with saturated NaOH and incubated for at least 24
h. This buffer was chosen for its ability to buffer from pH 3–9.
Following equilibration, the samples were centrifuged at 100 000g for 2 h at 4 °C and packed into 3.2 mm Varian rotors.

One-dimensional 15N spectra were recorded
on a 500 MHz (11.7 T) spectrometer courtesy of Dr. David J. Ruben,
using a 3.2 mm HCN Varian MAS probe at ωr/2π
= 10.5 kHz and regulated to ±10 Hz using a Bruker spinning frequency
controller. The temperature was controlled with VT gas regulated at
−6, 25, and 37 °C. The spectra were acquired with 83 kHz
TPPM decoupling and a CP contact time of 1.5 ms.

ZF-TEDOR NMR
spectra were recorded at 700 MHz 1H frequency using a home-built
spectrometer courtesy of Dr. David J. Rubin and a triple channel Varian
3.2 mm HCN probe. 13C and 15N chemical shifts
were referenced using the published shifts of adamantine relative
to DSS for 13C referencing and the IUPAC relative frequency
ratios between DSS (13C) and liquid ammonia (15N). Spectra acquired at 700 MHz were at ωr/2π
= 12.5 kHz. 83 kHz TPPM 1H decoupling was used in all experiments.
All spectra were recorded with VT gas regulated at the indicated temperature
approximately 1 in. from the stator. Z-filtered transferred echo double
resonance (ZF-TEDOR) was acquired using
1.4 ms mixing with 50 kHz 13C and 15N π-pulses.
The temperature under experimental conditions was measured to be 7
°C higher than the regulated VT cooling gas using the chemical
shift of KBr according to the method reported by Thurber and Tycko.1H detected spectra were recorded
at ω0I/2π = 750 MHz using a home-built spectrometer
courtesy of Dr. David J. Rubin and a 1.3 mm HCN Bruker probe (Bruker
Biospin, Billerica, MA) at ωr/2π = 60 kHz.
Fifteen kilohertz TPPM proton decoupling was used in all experiments.
The pulse sequence used to record 1H–15N spectra utilizes a polarization transferred from 1H
to 15N by cross-polarization (CP), which then evolves on 15N for a time t1 with 15 kHz of 1H decoupling. The 15N signal is then stored along z, and the 1H signal is
saturated to minimize the signal from protons not bonded to 15N. A second CP transfers signal from 15N to 1H, which is then detected. The CP contact time was 1.5 ms for the
transfer from 1H to 15N, and contact times of
0.2 and 0.5 ms were used for the transfer from 15N to 1H in separate experiments. Spectra recorded at 700 and 750
MHz were processed, displayed, and assigned using the NMRPipe software
package.

Results and Discussion
One-dimensional 15N MAS NMR spectra of His 37 in M218–60 are shown at 25 °C and pH values indicated
in Figure , with the corresponding spectra
at −6 and 37 °C shown in . We initially suspected, and later confirmed, that protonation of
His 37 does not occur at pH 8.5, with the spectrum displaying four
peaks at 166, 173, 249, and 253 ppm. The 166 and 173 ppm signals are
attributed to protonated 15N’s, and the 249 and
253 ppm, due to unprotonated 15N’s. Both sets of peaks correspond to the τ tautomer of
His, as observed previously for the M218–60 construct.,, The peak doubling is a result
of the dimer-of-dimer structure reported previously and was further confirmed by our ZF-TEDOR results that
are illustrated extensively in Figures  and . It is unclear what drives the dimer-of-dimers
formation in this construct; however, we note that it appears to be
maintained throughout the titration presented herein and that some
peak doubling was observed in a similar construct, M222–62. The chemical shift of the four resonances
do not shift substantially as the pH is decreased (Figure ); however, the unprotonated signal intensities
decrease, the two protonated signals increase, and a broad feature
concomitantly appears centered at 175–180 ppm. The signal at
175–180 is found to be strongly temperature-dependent, as this
feature is both broader and more pronounced as the temperature increases.
On the basis of the chemical shift, this broad line is assigned to
protonated 15N’s from an imidazolium ion in intermediate
exchange between protonated and deprotonated states (Figure ). Recent evidence points to water as the important
hydrogen-bonding partner for imidazolium in M2TM., The changes at pH 4.5 are more immediately apparent, with a second
broad signal present at 25 and 37 °C centered at 213 ppm, which
corresponds to the average chemical shift of the protonated (∼170
ppm) and unprotonated nitrogens (∼250 ppm) and is attributed
to rapid protonation and deprotonation between either 15N’s on adjacent His rings or between His and water within
the channel. The 50% occupancy of the
proton suggests a shared proton between two histidines, either directly
or mediated by other hydrogen-bonding partners, such as water within
the channel.

Schematic showing protonation
of ε nitrogen in the neutral
state. Protonation taking place as the pH is lowered occurs on the
δ1 nitrogen selectively.

Since His has two N’s, there are two possible tautomers
in the neutral state, with the so-called π tautomer present
when the δ-nitrogen is protonated and the τ tautomer present
when the ε2-15N is protonated, which is another detailed piece of information
in the proton conduction model. Although tautomerization occurs rapidly
in the solution state, it has been established that, in the solid
state, tautomerization is slow, allowing both tautomers to be observed
if they are present in the sample. Both
tautomers have been observed in previous studies of His 37 in M2TM and in free histidine and may also be present in M218–60. We therefore examined the ZF-TEDOR at pH 8.5 (), where His 37 is in the neutral state, clearly
showing that the protonated 15N is exclusively the ε-15N, schematically shown in Figure . This indicates that the τ tautomer is exclusively present
initially, with no evidence for tautomerization observed by MAS NMR,
and therefore the δ nitrogen is protonated as the pH is decreased.

The protonated 15N’s of histidine are known to
have higher CP efficiencies compared with those of the unprotonated 15N’s due to their closer proximity to 1H;
therefore, the differences in CP efficiencies need to be accounted
for to obtain genuine values of [HisH+]/[His] as a function
of pH., Equation () was used to calculate the ratio of [HisH+]/[His] as a function of pH.where IN is the
intensity of the unprotonated nitrogens, obtained by integration of
the signals at 249 and 253 ppm, INH is
the intensity of the protonated nitrogens likewise obtained by integration
of the signals at 166 and 173 ppm, and κ is defined as the ratio
of the integrated CP intensity of [HisH+]/[His] in a neutral
state., In our case, κ was found to be 1.83
at 37 °C, 1.56 at 25 °C, and 1.46 at −6 °C,
with all values measured at pH 8.5. Although the value of κ
should depend on the CP contact time and ωr/2π,
we note that the values we observed are similar to those reported
for M2TM at pH 8.5 (κ = 1.55) and crystalline histidine (κ = 1.464).

In the main text of this article, we have
chosen to focus on the
25 °C data, as the temperature of the sample is ∼7 °C
higher than that of the VT gas once frictional heating and warming
of the VT gas before reaching the probe are taken into account. [HisH+]/[His] extracted from eq  is shown
in Table  and displayed in Figure , along with simulations described below. The 1D 15N MAS NMR spectra show similar features and trends compared
to those of M2TM reported previously;, however, the plot of [HisH+]/[His] vs pH, extracted form
eq , is different, with previous studies on
M2TM showing a continual increase in the protonation of
the tetrad,, whereas our results show that
within pH range 5.5–7.5 the level of protonation is relatively
constant. [HisH+]/[His] is related to the maximum of four
pKa’s according to eqs  and .

The data points in Table  were fit with
eq  using a home-written MATLAB program by
searching a reduced chi-squared grid for the best fit of the data
with random noise incorporated in a Monte Carlo manner, with the latter
used to generate the error bars for the proton disassociation constants.
Surprisingly, only two distinct proton disassociation constants were
found, pKa1 = 7.63 ± 0.15
and pKa2 = 4.52 ± 0.15,
despite the model allowing for a maximum of four pKa’s. We emphasize that our fitting of this data
enables a maximum of four pKa’s
and that it is possible that two distinct pKa’s exist and are close to one another but are not distinguishable
from one another given the error of our measurements and simulations.
Degeneracy of proton dissociation constants has been observed previously and was attributed to cooperativity in the protonation
of the tetrameric channel, with the first protonation step making
the second protonation more favorable, resulting in two protons entering
the channel simultaneously. However, a second possibility should also
be considered, namely, shielding of the interaction between the two
charged side chains, where the two protons entering the channel have
a negligible impact on each other’s trajectory. Because the
M218–60 tetrameric channel has C2 symmetry, it is possible that each dimer within the
larger tetramer could be protonated independently, which would manifest
itself through similar pKa’s. Unfortunately,
we were unable to distinguish between these two possibilities, but
we note that noncooperativity appears to be a plausible option given
the symmetry of the channel along with the absence of observed proton
sharing, and it should be seriously considered alongside cooperative
proton transfer. The pKa’s found
are significantly different from the pKa of native histidine and could be due
to several possible explanations. The first pKa (7.63 ± 0.15) is shifted up relative to that of free
histidine and has previously been attributed in part to the presence
of a cation−π interaction between His 37 and Typ 41,
which stabilizes the charges within the channel and has been observed
by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Another
possible explanation may be due to the proton being shared among more
than one histidine within the channel, either directly through a low
barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB), or through a water
molecule as an intermediate to transfer the proton., We sought to probe whether either of these possibilities is present
in our system by recording the 1H chemical shifts of His
37 in a 1H-detected spectrum at high spinning frequency,
ωr/2π = 60 kHz. Figure  shows a 1H–15N correlation experiment
recorded at 750 MHz and 60 kHz, as described in the , at pH 8.5 and 6.5. These two pH values
were chosen because the channel should possess neutral charge at pH
8.5 and should be predominantly in the +2 state at pH 6.5. Unfortunately,
due to broadening at lower pH’s, we were unable to obtain spectra
under the acidic conditions necessary (pH 3.5) to observe the fully
protonated state. 15N signals corresponding to His 37 are
clearly observed at both pHs, with cross peaks at 166 ppm/12.1 ppm
and 173 ppm/14.5 ppm in the 15N/1H dimensions
at pH 8.5 and with only a small shift in the proton dimension observed
with cross peaks observed at 166 ppm/12.4 ppm and 173 ppm/14.8 ppm
at pH 6.5. The small change in the proton chemical shift likely indicates
that the uncharged and +2 charged states have similar hydrogen-bonding
characteristics. We anticipate that a LBHB would not be present in
the neutral state at pH 8.5, as the LBHB between adjacent His 37 is
thought to exist in the protonated state of the His 37 tetramer. If
a LBHB were present, then we would anticipate that the proton chemical
shift would move downfield as the tetrad is protonated. Therefore,
we conclude that although the chemical shifts are downfield we do
not believe this is indicative of a LBHB, as we anticipate a measurable
change in the 1H chemical shift in His 37 from pH 8.5 to
6.5. As will be discussed below, the
lowest temperature that we are able to achieve at this spinning frequency
is ∼30 °C and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility
that a LBHB could be present at lower temperatures; however, we note
that the spectra presented herein are close to physiological temperature
and would be the most relevant set of conditions to study the proton
mechanism. Another possibility to account for the proton sharing of
His 37 is that the proton is hydrogen-bonded to an adjacent water
molecule within the tetrameric channel. Hong et al. recently measured
the 1H–15N correlation in M2TM using a HETCOR experiment, which showed that protonated His 37 is
hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule within the channel. This study also showed two cross peaks at 160
ppm/8 ppm and another at 170 ppm/10 ppm, with the proton chemical
shift found to vary with pH. When the sample was frozen, they observed
a cross peak between His 37 and water, indicating that the hydrogen-bonding
partner is water; however, this feature was absent at elevated temperatures.
The proton chemical shifts observed for M218–60 are
shifted downfield relative to those reported for M2TM,
which is likely indicative of structural differences between M2TM and M218–60. We are unable to observe
any cross peaks with water, as we estimate that the lowest temperature
achievable at ωr/2π = 60 kHz is ∼30
°C.

correlation spectra at (a) pH 8.5 and (b) pH 6.5 of M218–60 H57Y ILFY (CP contact time 1 = 1.5 ms, CP contact time 2 = 0.2 ms.
ω0I/2π = 750 MHz, ωr/2π
= 60 kHz, 15 kHz TPPM decoupling, T = 30 °C).

While the first pKa at 25 °C is
shifted up to 7.63 ± 0.15, the second pKa (4.52 ± 0.15) is shifted down from that of histidine
as a result of electrostatic repulsion from placing the third and
fourth protons inside the channel. It was recently proposed that cation−π
interactions between His 37 and Trp 41 may be more pronounced at low
pH and may help to offset the electrostatic repulsion in the fully
protonated channel.

Dissociation
constants extracted from the spectra acquired at −6
and 37 °C were similar to those from 25 °C, with pKa’s of 7.42 ± 0.15 and 4.22 ±
0.15 at −6 °C and 7.55 ± 0.15 and 4.80 ± 0.15
at 37 °C. The initial protonation step seems to be relatively
temperature-independent, as the pKa’s
extracted are very similar and within the error of the measurement;
however, the second protonation step shows a dependence on temperature,
which indicates that the channel becomes increasingly easier to fully
protonate at elevated temperatures. The second protonation step fully
protonates the channel, and electrostatic repulsion is more likely
to be a substantial factor in protonation compared to the initial
protonation step. At elevated temperatures, His 37 should be more
mobile, increasing the average distance between the charges, whereas
at lower temperatures, the protein is expected to be less likely to
access favorable geometries for the fully protonated state. We speculate
that this is due to increased mobility of the protein, which would
allow the histidines to move away from one another, partially offsetting
the electrostatic repulsion. We also considered that the pKa’s of the buffer components may be temperature-dependent
and therefore alter the pH of the buffer at various temperatures,
with the temperature dependence of His 37’s pKa’s being a result of temperature-dependent changes
in the pH of the buffer. The pKa’s
of citrate and glutamic acid should be most relevant to the pH between
4 and 6, which decrease as temperature is increased, by about 0.04
units over the relevant temperature range. This should result in a decrease in pH as temperature is increased
and should have an impact on the fitted proton dissociation constants,
but it should do so only modestly and therefore it does not account
for the entirety of the temperature-dependent pKa’s.

The plot of [HisH+]/[His] vs pH
(Figure ) is qualitatively similar to the
analogous plot of proton
conduction reported previously using the M218–60 construct including the pseudosaturation region over a similar pH
range and implies that the rate of proton
conduction is directly proportional to [HisH+]/[His]. The
pKa’s extracted from our data indicates
that at pH &lt; 3.5 M218–60 is &gt;95% protonated.
If the shuttle model is responsible for proton conduction, then the
rate of proton conduction should be dictated by both the rate of small
angle rotations of His 37’s ring and whether a proton is bound
to His 37. Thus, at pH &lt; 3.5, the protonation of the histidine
has saturated, leaving the ring motion of histidine to limit the proton
conduction rate and resulting in a maximum rate that explains the
second saturation region observed in the proton conduction data.

Lastly, we sought to determine if any
global structural changes
were observed within the protein as a function of pH; therefore, we
acquired one-bond 13C–13C and 13C–15N correlations from PDSD and ZF-TEDOR experiments,
shown in Figures , . We anticipate that if other stable structures are present
at various pH’s, then we would observe chemical shift changes.
However, as the pH was decreased, no changes in the chemical shifts
of the cross peaks were observed; instead, we found a progressive
broadening and eventual disappearance of cross peaks at the lowest
pHs, which limited our ability to probe the structure of the protein
in the high-conductance +3 state. The broadening suggests that the
protein is able to access multiple conformations at low pH, and the
disappearance of peaks indicates that the sample is more dynamic.
This is consistent with the earlier observation on the same protein
construct using solution NMR in which decreasing the pH from 7.5 to
6.0 caused nearly complete broadening of resonances of the transmembrane
helices. We attempted to record INEPT spectra at all pH’s to determine
if any of the protein was highly mobile, but no INEPT signal was observed
(data not shown). Thus, MAS NMR spectra do not indicate global changes
in protein structure as a function of pH, which was observed by X-ray
crystallography.

Conclusions
MAS NMR was used to
measure the pH-dependent protonation of M218–60 in
the dimer-of-dimers structure. The level of
protonation observed in the spectra correlates with previously measured
proton conduction rates, supporting the shuttle model of proton transfer.
The second protonation step is found to be temperature-dependent and
is likely due to electrostatic repulsion from the four protons in
the fully protonated state. We also show that M218–60 accesses more conformations in acidic solutions and that a stable
open-state structure is not triggered by protonation. The 1H chemical shifts of H37 side chains showed no evidence for a LBHB
among His 37 residues. Taken together, the data suggest that the first
doubly degenerate pKa is shifted up due
to cation−π interactions, whereas the second doubly degenerate
pKa is shifted down due to electrostatic
interactions. The third and fourth protonation events occur more frequently
at the low endosomal pH, leading to conduction via the shuttle mechanism.
