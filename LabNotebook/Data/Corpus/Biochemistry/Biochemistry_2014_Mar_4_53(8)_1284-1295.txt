Nitric oxide
(NO) plays a plethora
of physiological and pathophysiological roles in biology. The main source of NO in mammals is the enzyme
nitric-oxide synthase (NOS, EC 1.14.13.39), which catalyzes the conversion
of l-arginine (Arg) into l-citrulline and NO.− The three isoforms, neuronal, endothelial, and inducible NOS (nNOS,
eNOS, and iNOS), differ in tissue distribution and physiological function.
All isoforms are dimeric and utilize O2 and the electron
donor NADPH as cosubstrates. A key role in the mechanism of NO synthesis
is played by the essential cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin ((6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin, BH4).− In the absence of BH4, the enzyme still oxidizes NADPH and reduces
O2, but the oxidation of Arg is blocked, a phenomenon known
as uncoupling.− Under these conditions, NOS produces O2– instead of NO, with major potential pathophysiological consequences:
the bioavailability of NO decreases by diminished NO production and
efficient scavenging of NO by O2–, and
the reaction between O2– and NO results
in the formation of the strongly oxidizing and presumably deleterious
product peroxynitrite (ONOO–).

Recombinant
nNOS expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells,
which have the capacity to synthesize BH4 endogenously, contains a
substoichiometric amount of BH4 after purification, usually amounting
to approximately 50% per dimer or heme.− Similar stoichiometries have been reported for the
other isoforms as well.− Addition of BH4 to such preparations causes full saturation of the
enzyme with BH4, accompanied by increased NO formation and diminished
O2–/H2O2 production.,− Addition of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2), which binds
to NOS with comparable affinity as BH4 but does not support NO synthesis,
to BH4-saturated nNOS lowers NO production to the level observed before
BH4 addition but does not affect the basal activity., On the basis of these observations and detailed binding studies
with radiolabeled BH4 and BH4-deficient nNOS, we proposed that BH4
binds to NOS anticooperatively., Accordingly, dimeric
NOS has two identical binding sites with very high affinity for BH4
(≤1 nM), but binding of BH4 to one site lowers the affinity
of the second site by several orders of magnitude.,− This concept implies reversible binding of BH4 to
both sites, in line with the observation that all bound radioligand
dissociated from the enzyme in the presence of unlabeled BH4.,,

Although this model explained
most of the data, some questions
remained. Specifically, if high-affinity BH4 binding is reversible,
it is unclear why inhibitory pteridines such as BH2 cannot block NOS
activity completely.,, There also appears to be a discrepancy between the enzyme expressed
in and purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and NOS from expression
systems like Escherichia coli that do not synthesize
BH4: with some exceptions,,, there is little evidence in the literature for tight BH4 binding
to such enzyme species. In this respect,
it may be relevant that iNOS was reported to form undisruptable dimers
when expressed in Sf9 cells but not in E. coli, suggesting an effect of the expression system on the
enzyme structure.

To resolve these
issues, we decided to revisit the topic of high-
and low-affinity BH4 binding. Specifically, we searched for answers
to the following questions: (i) Can we reproduce the previously published
observations of high- and low-affinity binding of BH4 to baculovirus-infected
Sf9-expressed nNOS that prompted us to propose anticooperative BH4
binding? (ii) Does E. coli-expressed BH4-free nNOS
behave differently in this respect? (iii) If so, can these differences
be offset by preincubation with BH4? The results of the present study
confirm the heterogeneity of BH4 binding in nNOS derived from Sf9
cells. Such heterogeneity is absent in E. coli-derived nNOS initially but becomes evident after preincubation
with BH4. The same effect is observed upon preincubation with 4-amino-tetrahydrobiopterin
(4-amino-BH4) but not with the dihydropteridines BH2 and 4-amino-dihydrobiopterin
(4-amino-BH2). We propose that incubation of pterin-free nNOS with
BH4 results in one tight-binding site per dimer in a reaction that
involves redox chemistry.

Materials and Methods
Materials
l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine
hydrochloride ([3H]-Arg, 57 Ci/mmol) was from American
Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., purchased through Humos Diagnostic GmbH
(Maria Enzersdorf, Austria). [3′-3H](6R)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydro-l-biopterin ([3H]-BH4, 14
Ci/mmol) was prepared as described. Pteridines
were from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories, Jona, Switzerland. Stock solutions
of tetrahydropteridines were prepared in 10 mM HCl; dihydropteridines
were dissolved in water. Oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb) was prepared from hemoglobin
(Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. H2500) immediately before use. Other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna,
Austria).

Enzyme Expression and Purification
Rat recombinant
(BH4-containing) nNOS, designated Sf9-nNOS hereafter, was purified
from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described.

To obtain E. coli-expressed nNOS,
designated ECo-nNOS hereafter, we prepared the human enzyme as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein according to a standard protocol.
Briefly, human nNOS cDNA sequences were obtained by PCR using a pcDNA3
plasmid with a human nNOS insert and primers that were designed to
incorporate NdeI and NotI restriction sites. Subsequently this product
was cloned into the NdeI–NotI sites of a pGEX-4T1 vector with
the help of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen; #15224-017) to create a glutathione-S-transferase–nNOS fusion construct under transcriptional
regulation by the inducible bacterial tac promoter. This construct
was amplified in chemical competent BL21 cells (One Shot TOP-10 Chemical
Competent E. coli; Life Technologies) and used to
transfect BL21(DE3) E. coli. Expression of the fusion
protein was induced for 20 h with 0.2 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in a freshly diluted overnight bacterial
culture. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50
mM tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane (Tris, pH 7.5), 100 μg/mL
lysozyme, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100,
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated for 8 × 10 s on
ice, and centrifuged (20 min, 17 000 rpm, 4 °C). The supernatant
was incubated with glutathione-sepharose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat.
Nr. G4510) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times
with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100,
and three times with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. The protein was eluted with the same
buffer containing 10 mM glutathione. Enzyme concentrations were determined
spectroscopically from the Soret absorbance peak and expressed as
the concentration of the monomer assuming a molecular mass of 160
kDa.

The purified protein displayed a Soret band at 404 nm that
shifted
to 401 nm in the presence of 100 μM BH4 (), indicative
of a largely high-spin species. It contained 46 ± 1% FAD/heme
and 31 ± 1% FMN/heme and no BH4. For comparison, Sf9-nNOS contained
49 ± 1% FAD/heme, 33 ± 1% FMN/heme, and 35 ± 3% BH4/heme.
Flavin and pterin contents were determined by HPLC according to published
procedures.

Oxyhemoglobin Assay
NO formation was determined spectrophotometrically
with a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer as the
conversion of oxyHb to methemoglobin by monitoring the absorbance
difference between 420 and 401 nm. Purified nNOS (2 μg/mL, ∼11
nM) was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mM triethanolamine (TEA, pH
7.4) containing 0.2 mM Arg, 0.2 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM
FMN, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μM oxyHb, 1000 U/mL superoxide
dismutase (SOD), 50 mU/mL catalase (CAT), 0.2 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate
(CHAPS), 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and pteridines
as indicated. The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μg/mL
calmodulin (CaM) and monitored for 3 min. NO concentrations were calculated
with an absorbance difference coefficient of ΔΔε420–401 = 91.9 mM–1·cm–1. Values were corrected for oxyHb autoxidation
by subtraction of blank rates obtained in the absence of enzyme.

Overnight preincubations were carried out at ∼8 °C with
5 μg/mL (∼27 nM) nNOS in 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4) containing
0.5 mM Arg, 0.5 mM CHAPS, 0.25 mM EDTA, and pteridines as indicated;
these mixtures were diluted 2.5-fold at the start of the reaction
to yield the assay conditions indicated above.

For the determination
of the time dependence of the emergence of
tight binding (Figure ), all ingredients were
present during preincubation at ∼4 °C, except for the
second (“incubation”) pteridine (10 μM BH4 or
4-amino-BH4) and CaM (10 μg/mL), which were added at the start
of the reaction.

Plots of the activity vs the pterin concentration
were fitted to
variations of the Hill equation:orwhere [I] is the concentrations of the inhibitory
pterin, Act0 and Act∞ are the activities
in the absence and presence of the pterin, respectively, and h is the Hill coefficient.

To obtain an indication
for the affinity of the inhibitor in the
absence of the activating pterin, we calculated apparent inhibition
constants according to

Citrulline
Assay
NOS activity was also determined as
the formation of [3H]-citrulline from [3H]-Arg. Purified nNOS (2 μg/mL, ∼11 nM)
was incubated for 10 min in 0.1 mL of 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4) containing
0.1 mM [3H]-Arg (∼60 000 cpm), 0.2 mM NADPH,
5 μM FAD, 5 μM FMN, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM CHAPS,
0.1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/mL CaM, and pteridines as indicated at 37
°C, followed by separation and detection of [3H]-citrulline.
Blank values were determined in the absence of enzyme.

Radioligand
Binding Studies
Radioligand binding experiments
were performed as described previously., To determine
the rate of association, purified nNOS (40 μg/mL, ∼216
nM) was incubated at 37, 25, and 8 °C with [3H]-BH4
(20 nM) in 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM Arg. For dissociation
kinetics, the enzyme was preincubated in 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4) and 0.1
mM Arg for 10 min (37 °C), 20 min (25 °C), or 60 min (8
°C) with 20 nM [3H]-BH4, after which excess BH2 (1
mM) was added at t = 0. Separation of bound from
free radioligand was performed by polyethylene glycol precipitation
and rapid vacuum filtration over Whatman glass fiber filters (GF/B).
Filters were treated at room temperature with 0.15 M H3PO4 for 3 h, followed by incubation with scintillation
fluid (Ultima Gold XR, PerkinElmer Inc.) and scintillation counting. Rate constants were calculated by fitting the
individual data to single exponentials.

Low-Temperature Polyacrylamide
Gel Electrophoresis (LT-PAGE)
To test for tight dimer formation,
the enzyme was analyzed by low-temperature
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-PAGE. The
protein (20 μg) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in 0.1
mL TEA (50 mM, pH 7.4) with Arg (1 mM) and BH4, 4-amino-BH4, BH2,
or 4-amino-BH2 (0.2 mM each). After addition of 0.1 mL of chilled
0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), containing 4% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol,
20% (w/v) glycerol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromophenol blue, samples containing
8 μg of nNOS were subjected to SDS-PAGE for 90 min at 120 V
on discontinuous 4% SDS gels (1.5 mm). Gels and buffers were equilibrated
at 4 °C, and the buffer tank was cooled during electrophoresis
in an ice bath. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and
densitometrically analyzed with an E.A.S.Y. 440K camera (Herolab GmbH)
and ImageJ 1.46r software (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health,
USA).

Separation and Determination of NOS-Bound and Free Pteridines
after Overnight Incubation
ECo-nNOS (∼1 μM)
was incubated overnight at ∼8 °C with 10 μM BH4
in 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mM Arg, 0.5 mM CHAPS, and 0.25
mM EDTA in a total volume of 2.5 mL. This mixture was diluted 6-fold
with the same buffer (50 mM TEA, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mM Arg, 0.5
mM CHAPS, and 0.25 mM EDTA) and concentrated by ultrafiltration for
15 min at 4000g (Amicon Ultra-15, Merck Millipore,
cutoff 50 kDa) to a final volume of ∼500 μL. The heme
content was then estimated from the Soret peak (398 nm, ε =
91.9 mM–1·cm–1), and the
pteridine content (BH4 and BH2/biopterin) was determined by HPLC as
published.

Results
Effect of BH4 and BH2 on
NO Production by Sf9-nNOS
We first determined the effect
of BH4 on NO formation by Sf9-nNOS
with the oxyHb assay. This enzyme already contains approximately 1
equivalent of BH4 per dimer, resulting in half-maximal activity in
the absence of added BH4. Indeed, as
illustrated in Figure A, BH4 induced an increase
of the activity with an EC50 of (2.4 ± 0.6) ×
10–7 M, and the activity in the absence of added
BH4 was 44 ± 3% of the maximal activity, in line with published
observations., As reported previously, BH2 inhibited the increase in activity induced
by additional BH4 (10 μM), but not the basal activity (Figure B), with an IC50 of (1.3 ± 1.1)
× 10–5 M, which, assuming simple competition,
corresponds to a Kiapp of ∼3
× 10–7 M.

by BH2 in the absence (closed symbols) and presence (open symbols)
of 10 μM BH4. The curve through the data in the presence of
BH4 is the best fit to the Hill equation with fitting parameters IC50 = (1.3 ± 1.1) × 10–5 M, Act0 = 283 ± 7 nmol·mg–1·min–1, Act∞ = 177 ± 17 nmol·mg–1·min–1, h =
0.5 ± 0.2. Experimental conditions: 2 μg/mL (∼13
nM) Sf9-nNOS, 0.2 mM Arg, 0.2 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM
FMN, 10 μg/mL CaM, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μM oxyHb,
1000 U/mL SOD, 50 mU/mL CAT, 0.2 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM TEA
(pH 7.4), and pteridines as indicated at 37 °C. Data points are
presented ± SEM (n = 3).

Effect of BH4 and BH2 on NO Production by ECo-nNOS
We next
repeated these experiments with ECo-nNOS, which does not
contain BH4 as isolated. This enzyme had no basal activity and was
activated monophasically by BH4 with an EC50 of (2.0 ±
0.3) × 10–7 M (Figure A), in line with observations obtained with BH4-deficient Sf9-nNOS. Contrary to the result obtained with Sf9-nNOS,
BH2 inhibited the activity in the presence of 10 μM BH4 completely
with an IC50 of (2.42 ± 0.13) × 10–5 M, which corresponds to a Kiapp of (4.7 ± 0.4) × 10–7 M (Figure B). These results imply that ECo-nNOS does not exhibit
biphasic BH4 binding under these conditions.

0.96 ± 0.04. Experimental conditions: 2 μg/mL (∼11
nM) ECo-nNOS, 0.2 mM Arg, 0.2 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM
FMN, 10 μg/mL CaM, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μM oxyHb,
1000 U/mL SOD, 50 mU/mL CAT, 0.2 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM TEA
(pH 7.4), and pteridines as indicated at 37 °C. Data points are
presented ± SEM (n = 3).

Effect of BH4 and BH2 on NO Production by ECo-nNOS after Overnight
Incubation with BH4
The lack of biphasicity might be a property
of the expression system, or high-affinity BH4 binding might require
preincubation with the pteridine. To discriminate between these possibilities,
we incubated ECo-nNOS at ∼8 °C overnight with 25 μM
BH4. This procedure yielded an enzyme with a basal activity (in the
absence of BH4) about half as high as observed at saturating BH4 concentrations
before preincubation (compare Figures  and A). Additional BH4 resulted in an activity increase
to a maximal level of approximately 75% of that observed before overnight
incubation, with an EC50 of (1.0 ± 0.9) × 10–6 M (Figure A, see  for corresponding citrulline formation). The activity increase,
but not the basal activity, was blocked by BH2 with an IC50 of (1.8 ± 1.0) × 10–7 M (Figure B and ). These results imply that overnight incubation
with BH4 transforms ECo-nNOS into an enzyme with similar properties
as the Sf9-expressed enzyme (apart from the exceptionally low IC50 for BH2, for which we currently have no explanation yet).

the data is the best fit to the Hill equation with fitting parameters

1.3 ± 1.2. Panel B shows the inhibition by BH2 in the absence
(closed symbols) and presence (open symbols) of 10 μM BH4. The
curve through the data in the presence of BH4 is the best fit to the

1.0) × 10–7 M, Act0 = 146 ±
4 nmol·mg–1·min–1, Act∞ = 86 ± 3 nmol·mg–1·min–1, h = 0.96 ± 0.04. Overnight
incubation conditions: 5 μg/mL (∼27 nM) ECo-nNOS, 0.5
mM Arg, 0.5 mM CHAPS, 0.25 mM EDTA, and 25 μM BH4 in 50 mM TEA
(pH 7.4) at ∼8 °C. Assay conditions: 2 μg/mL (∼11
nM) ECo-nNOS, 0.2 mM Arg, 0.2 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM
FMN, 10 μg/mL CaM, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μM oxyHb,
1000 U/mL SOD, 50 mU/mL CAT, 0.2 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM TEA
(pH 7.4), and pteridines as indicated at 37 °C. Note that the
assay samples also contain 10 μM (autoxidized) BH4, carried
over from the preincubation mixture. Data points are presented ±
SEM (n = 3).

To investigate if BH2 might be able to replace tightly bound
BH4
over a longer period, we incubated Sf9-nNOS for 24 and 48 h at 8 °C
in the absence and presence of 100 μM BH2 (). In the absence
of BH4, the activity decreased from 215 ± 10 to 160 ± 19
and 128 ± 15 nmol·mg–1·min–1 after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Addition of 10 μM BH4 to
these samples yielded approximately doubled these activities to 409,
357, and 235 nmol·mg–1·min–1 after 0, 24, and 48 h, demonstrating that the low-affinity binding
site was still accessible. When these experiments were performed in
the presence of 100 μM BH2, we observed residual activities
of 208 ± 11, 156 ± 10, and 131 ± 3 nmol·mg–1·min–1 after 0, 24, and 48
h, respectively. These values are essentially indiscernible from the
activities in the absence of BH2, indicating that no exchange between
BH2 and tightly bound BH4 takes places even after 48 h.

Pteridine Content
of ECo-nNOS after Overnight Incubation with
BH4
In confirmation of these observations, HPLC determinations
indicated that after overnight incubation with 10 μM BH4 ECo-nNOS
contained 43 ± 5% BH4/heme, which compares well to the BH4 content
of Sf9-nNOS (35 ± 3% BH4/heme). After overnight incubation, these
enzyme samples contained a large excess of BH2 (4.6 ± 0.7 μM).
However, after one cycle of dilution followed by ultrafiltration (see ) the BH2 content decreased
to 7.3 ± 0.4% per heme, while the BH4 content remained fixed
at 45 ± 3%, indicating that all BH4 was bound tightly to the
enzyme, whereas BH2, originating from autoxidation of excess BH4,
was not. These results also imply that there was no exchange between
tightly bound BH4 and autoxidized BH2 in solution.

Effect of BH4
on NO Production by ECo-nNOS after Overnight Incubation
with BH2
To investigate if BH2 can also induce high-affinity
binding, we incubated the enzyme overnight in the presence of 25 μM
BH2. In the case of high-affinity BH2 binding, this procedure should
yield an enzyme that can only be activated to half the value observed
before preincubation. However, as shown in Figure A (and ), the maximal activity was not affected by preincubation with BH2.
Instead, preincubation with BH2 caused a rightward shift of the curve
to an EC50 of (4.7 ± 0.3) × 10–6 M. Assuming that BH2 is stable during preincubation, the observed
shift of the curve corresponds to a Kiapp for BH2 of (4.3 ± 1.2) × 10–7 M, in excellent agreement with the value calculated from Figure . These observations demonstrate that, unlike BH4,
BH2 is not able to create a tight-binding site.

obtained without overnight preincubation with BH2 (Figure A) is shown as well (gray small circles, dashed
line). Panel B shows the stimulation by BH4 of NO formation, measured
with the oxyHb assay, after overnight incubation with 4-amino-BH4
(closed circles) or 4-amino-BH2 (open circles). The curves through
the data are best fits to the Hill equation with fitting parameters

(1.04 ± 0.19) × 10–5 M, Act0 = 9 ± 4 nmol·mg–1·min–1, Act∞ = 185 ± 8 nmol·mg–1·min–1, h = 0.82 ± 0.11
for 4-amino-BH2 preincubation. For comparison, the curve obtained
without preincubation (Figure A) is included
as well (small gray symbols, dashed line). Overnight incubation conditions:
5 μg/mL (∼27 nM) ECo-nNOS, 0.5 mM Arg, 0.5 mM CHAPS,
0.25 mM EDTA, and 25 μM pteridine (BH2, 4-amino-BH4, or 4-amino-BH2)
in 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4) at ∼8 °C. Assay conditions: 2 μg/mL
(∼11 nM) ECo-nNOS, 0.2 mM Arg, 0.2 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD,
5 μM FMN, 10 μg/mL CaM, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μM
oxyHb, 1000 U/mL SOD, 50 mU/mL CAT, 0.2 mM CHAPS, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50
mM TEA (pH 7.4), and BH4 as indicated at 37 °C. Note that the
assay samples also contain 10 μM BH2, (autoxidized) 4-amino-BH4,
or 4-amino-BH2, carried over from the preincubation mixture. Data
points are presented ± SEM (n = 4 or 3 for BH2
or 4-amino-BH4 preincubation, and for 4-amino-BH2 preincubation, respectively).

Effect of BH4 on NO Production
by ECo-nNOS after Overnight Incubation
with 4-Amino-BH4
To investigate why BH4 but not BH2 induced
formation of tight pterin binding, we repeated the experiment with
4-amino-BH4. As illustrated by Figure B (and ), the maximal
activity attained with BH4 was decreased by approximately 50% after
overnight preincubation with 4-amino-BH4, concomitant with a rightward
shift of the EC50 to 1.1 ± 0.3 × 10–5 M. These results suggest that 4-amino-BH4, like BH4, induces the
formation of one tight pterin-binding site per dimer.

To ascertain
that the inability of BH2 to replace tightly bound BH4 was not due
to its inability to create a tight-binding site, we repeated the experiments
of Figure B with 4-amino-BH4 instead of BH2.
We found that 4-amino-BH4 did not significantly affect the residual
activity after overnight incubation with BH4 (80 ± 4 and 67 ±
11 in the absence and presence of 1 mM 4-amino-BH4, respectively;
results not shown), indicating that, like BH2, 4-amino-BH4 cannot
displace BH4 from its tight-binding site.

Effect of BH4 on NO Production
by ECo-nNOS after Overnight Incubation
with 4-Amino-BH2
BH4 and 4-amino-BH4 differ from BH2 primarily
by their redox state. To investigate if the redox state is critical
for high-affinity binding, we repeated the experiment after overnight
incubation with 4-amino-BH2, the 2-electron oxidized form of 4-amino-BH4.
Like BH2 and in contrast to 4-amino-BH4, overnight incubation with
4-amino-BH2 did not affect the maximal activity with BH4; it only
caused a rightward shift of the concentration–response curve (EC50 to (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10–5 M, Figure B, ). These results suggest that only fully reduced pteridines are able
to induce tight pterin binding.

One way in which the pterin
redox state might influence the results is by autoxidation, which
will affect tetra- but not dihydropteridines. If autoxidation of BH4
were crucial for the formation of a high-affinity binding site, no
high-affinity binding should be observed in the absence of oxygen
during preincubation. As illustrated by Figure , overnight anaerobic preincubation of ECo-nNOS with BH4 yielded
an enzyme that was maximally active. This can be explained by the
fact that without autoxidation the concentration of BH4 in solution
remains saturating overnight. However, BH2 could only inhibit about
half of the activity (with IC50 (3.0 ± 1.5) ×
10–5 M), indicating that despite the absence of
oxygen a high-affinity site had formed. This demonstrates that the
presence of O2 is no prerequisite for high-affinity binding
site formation.

formation, measured with the oxyHb assay. The curve through the data

as indicated at 37 °C. Note that the assay samples also contain
10 μM BH4, carried over from the anaerobic preincubation mixture.
Data points are presented ± SEM (n = 3).

Association and Dissociation
Kinetics of ECo-nNOS and Radiolabeled
BH4
Whereas the activity titration studies described above
are characterized by virtually irreversible tight BH4 binding, prior
radioligand binding studies suggested otherwise. Specifically, the
complete displacement of radiolabeled BH4 from the enzyme in the presence
of excess unlabeled BH4 implied that high-affinity BH4 binding is
essentially reversible.,, To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we measured the association
and dissociation kinetics of radiolabeled BH4 for ECo-nNOS. As shown
in Figure A, binding of [3H]-BH4
appears to display two phases with about half of the label bound within
seconds, and the other half binding with apparent rate constants of
0.91 ± 0.16, 0.55 ± 0.10, and 0.076 ± 0.006 min–1 at 37, 25, and 8 °C, respectively. At 8 and
25 °C, most of the label was still recovered after 24 h, whereas
the enzyme tended to lose the label at 37 °C. In agreement with
prior observations, BH2 displaced the label at 37 °C almost completely
(96%) with an apparent rate constant of (1.70 ± 0.05) ×
10–2 min–1 (Figure B). At lower temperatures, BH2 was able to displace about
60% of the label with apparent rate constants of (7.78 ± 0.13)
× 10–3 and (2.9 ± 0.5) × 10–3 min–1 at 25 and 8 °C, respectively, with
the remaining 40% still bound after 24 h. Virtually identical results
were obtained when unlabeled BH4 was applied instead of BH2 to displace
[3H]-BH4 (not shown). These results indicate that, at least
at 37 °C, BH4 binding is reversible.

Kinetics of BH4 binding
to ECo-nNOS. (A) Association of radiolabeled
BH4 to ECo-nNOS at 8 (open circles), 25 (closed circles), and 37 °C
(squares, dotted line). Experimental conditions: 40 μg/mL (∼250
nM) ECo-nNOS, 20 nM [3H]-BH4, 0.1 mM Arg, 50 mM TEA (pH
7.4). The data points are presented ± SEM (n = 2). The curves through the data points are best single-exponential
fits with parameters: at 37 °C: ka = 0.91 ± 0.16 min–1, Δ[3H]-BH4 = 264 ± 24 fmol, [3H]-BH4∞ = 444 ± 6 fmol; at 25 °C: ka = 0.55 ± 0.10 min–1, Δ[3H]-BH4 = 217 ± 17 fmol, [3H]-BH4∞ = 499 ± 6 fmol; at 8 °C: ka = 0.076 ± 0.006 min–1, Δ[3H]-BH4 = 314 ± 9 fmol, [3H]-BH4∞ = 554 ± 8 fmol. The data points are presented ± SEM (n = 2). (B) Dissociation of radiolabeled BH4 from ECo-nNOS
at 8 (open circles), 25 (closed circles), and 37 °C (squares,
dotted line). The procedure was the same as for association, except
that excess BH2 (1 mM) was added after 10, 20, or 60 min incubation
with [3H]-BH4 at 37, 25, and 8 °C, respectively. The
time of BH2 addition was taken as t = 0. The curves
through the data points are best single-exponential fits with parameters:
at 37 °C: kd = (17.0 ± 0.5)
× 10–3 min–1, Δ[3H]-BH4 = 485 ± 4 fmol, [3H]-BH4∞ = 19 ± 3 fmol; at 25 °C: kd = (7.8 ± 1.3) × 10–3 min–1, Δ[3H]-BH4 = 252 ± 14 fmol, [3H]-BH4∞ = 161 ± 13 fmol; at 8 °C: kd = (2.9 ± 0.5) × 10–3 min–1, Δ[3H]-BH4 = 266 ± 23 fmol,
[3H]-BH4∞ = 184 ± 22 fmol. The data
points are presented ± SEM (n = 2).

A possible explanation could be that the autoxidation
product in
the overnight incubation experiments is not necessarily BH2, since
aerobic autoxidation has been reported to yield varying mixtures of
BH2, 7,8-dihydropterin, and other products, depending on the reaction
conditions. It is therefore conceivable
that autoxidation under the present conditions yields a product mixture
with low affinity for NOS. To check this possibility, we repeated
the dissociation studies with [3H]-BH4 in the presence
of autoxidized (overnight) BH4. The results were identical to those
observed in the presence of BH2 or unlabeled BH4 (not shown). In line
with previous observations with BH4-deficient Sf9-nNOS, these results suggest that BH4 binding is completely
reversible at 37 °C in contradiction to the results obtained
with the activity assays (see ).

Kinetics of High-Affinity Binding Site Formation
In
the present studies, we routinely incubated the enzyme overnight with
an excess of pteridine to elicit the transformation from an enzyme
that binds BH4 monophasically to a species that has one pterin bound
(quasi-)irreversibly. In solution, free BH4 will be completely autoxidized
within this period; in fact, we observed spectrophotometrically that
BH4 autoxidized with t1/2 of ∼2
h, with complete autoxidation achieved after approximately 6–7
h under the conditions of preincubation (). Consequently, binding site
formation must also be complete within this period. To investigate
the kinetics of the process, we performed a series of experiments,
in which we preincubated the enzyme with 1.0 μM 4-amino-BH4
for varying periods (0–10 min), followed by the determination
of the activity in the presence of 10 μM BH4. As shown in Figure , preincubation with
1 μM 4-amino-BH4 gradually reduced the activity that could be
attained to a value slightly greater (58 ± 2%) than half the
activity observed when both pterins were added simultaneously, with
an apparent rate constant of 1.6 ± 0.3 min–1.

the effect of the time interval between BH4 and 4-amino-BH4 administration
on the rate of NO formation by ECo-nNOS, as measured with the oxyHb
assay. Closed circles: the enzyme was preincubated with 1 μM
4-amino-BH4 for the indicated time, after which the activity was determined
in the presence of 10 μM BH4. The curve through the data points
is the best fit to a single exponential with parameters: kobs = 1.6 ± 0.3 min–1, Act0 = 151 ± 4 nmol·mg–1·min–1, Act∞ = 87 ± 2 nmol·mg–1·min–1. Open circles: the enzyme
was preincubated with 1 μM BH4 for the indicated time, after
which the activity was determined in the presence of 10 μM 4-amino-BH4.
The curve through the data points is the best fit to a single exponential
with parameters: kobs = 0.23 ± 0.10
min–1, Act0 = 16 ± 4 nmol·mg–1·min–1, Act∞ = 79 ± 11 nmol·mg–1·min–1. In both cases data points are shown ± SEM (n = 3). Preincubation conditions: 2 μg/mL (∼11 nM) ECo-nNOS,
0.2 mM Arg, 0.2 mM NADPH, 5 μM FAD, 5 μM FMN, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5 μM oxyHb, 1000 U/mL SOD, 50 mU/mL CAT, 0.2 mM CHAPS,
0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM TEA (pH 7.4), and 1 μM BH4 or 4-amino-BH4
at 4 °C. The assay conditions were the same except for the temperature
(37 °C), the presence of 10 μM 4-amino-BH4 or BH4 (in the
case of preincubation with BH4 and 4-amino-BH4, respectively), and
the presence of 10 μg/mL CaM, which was added to start the reaction.
In both cases, data points are shown ± SEM (n = 3).

We also performed the reverse
experiment, in which we added BH4
(1 μM) first and an excess of 4-amino-BH4 (10 μM) at the
start of the assay. As shown in Figure , in
this case the activity increased when the time interval between the
addition of the pterins became longer, from a very low value when
both pterins were added together, to a similar final value as in the
reverse experiment (79 ± 11 compared to 87 ± 2 nmol·min–1·mg–1). However, the transition
appears to be considerably slower under these conditions (0.23 ±
0.10 min–1).

Effect of Incubation with
Pteridines on Dimer Stability of ECo-nNOS
It is well documented
that BH4 enhances NOS dimer stability.,,,,, To check if
high-affinity BH4 binding-site formation correlates with the formation
of a SDS-resistant NOS dimer, we performed LT-PAGE of ECo-nNOS with
and without preincubation with different pteridines (Figure ). It should be noted that in these experiments
we are not monitoring the actual oligomeric state of the protein,
which is expected to be almost completely dimeric, but rather the effects of tight pterin binding on the SDS-resistance
of the dimer, which is anticipated to reflect structural changes at
the dimer interface. Without pteridines, dimers were not detectable,
but preincubation with BH4 or 4-amino-BH4 yielded 43 ± 3 and
44 ± 3% of SDS-resistant dimers, in line with published observations., Preincubation of the enzyme with BH2 or 4-amino-BH2 on the other
hand did not produce any SDS-resistant dimers, suggesting a link with
tight-binding site formation.

Discussion
Incubation of ECo-nNOS with BH4 Results in
Tight Binding of
1 equiv of BH4 per NOS dimer
Our first goal was to establish
if there is a difference in the response to BH4 between BH4-containing
Sf9-nNOS and BH4-free ECo-nNOS. We found that both enzyme species
exhibited a similar EC50 for added BH4 with no indication
of biphasic behavior for ECo-nNOS, indicating that the enzyme does
not display high-affinity pterin binding upon short-term exposure
to BH4. One possible explanation for this would be that BH4 must be
present during protein synthesis to be bound with high affinity. It
is also conceivable that the expression system affects the structure
of the enzyme in some way. Interestingly, it has been reported that
iNOS forms undisruptable dimers when expressed in Sf9 cells but not
in E. coli, suggesting that the
expression system may indeed affect NOS structure. However, overnight incubation of ECo-nNOS with BH4 yielded
an enzyme with very similar pterin-binding properties as the Sf9-expressed
enzyme. This demonstrates that the expression system is not essential
for high-affinity pterin binding and that BH4 need not be present
during enzyme synthesis.

Whereas there is good agreement between
the data obtained with Sf9- and ECo-nNOS, previous studies suggest
that eNOS and iNOS behave differently. Similar to the present study,
preincubation of BH4-free E. coli-expressed iNOS with BH4 yielded an enzyme species that still contained
strongly bound BH4 (approximately 0.3–0.4 equiv), but, contrary
to nNOS, BH4 was able to induce (almost) complete reactivation of
iNOS after preincubation with 4-amino-BH4. Unlike nNOS, Sf9-expressed eNOS appears to contain very little BH4
after purification (≤10%) and
to lose all bound BH4 in a few hours at 24 °C. These studies seem to indicate that the other isoforms
show no (eNOS) or less (iNOS) tight binding. However, further studies
are necessary to resolve this issue.

Tight Binding Is Induced
by Tetra- but Not by Dihydropteridines
Intriguingly, tight
pterin binding was induced in ECo-nNOS by BH4
and 4-amino-BH4 but not by the respective 2-electron oxidized species
BH2 and 4-amino-BH2. Since all pterins appear to be bound comparably
with similar allosteric and conformational consequences, this suggests that the redox state of the pteridines
is directly involved in the process of tight binding. Consequently,
the phenomenon is unlikely to represent a simple binding equilibrium
(see below).

Interestingly, the different effects of the tetra-
and dihydropteridines on tight pterin binding appear to be mirrored
by the effects on the formation of SDS-resistant dimers, which also
required the tetrahydro- derivatives. In apparent contrast to the
present results, BH2 has been reported to stabilize NOS dimers., However, the study by Klatt et al. was performed with BH4-containing
nNOS purified from porcine brain and did show a considerably weaker
effect by BH2 compared to BH4. Presta
et al. determined the effect on dimer formation per se for iNOS. Both studies may have reported on a more general
effect of pterins on dimerization rather than the more specific redox-state
dependent effect observed here.

Is High-Affinity Pterin
Binding Reversible?
When we
first noticed that BH2 is unable to expel endogenously bound BH4 from
its binding site on nNOS, we explained this by heterogeneity, with
part of the enzyme having BH4 irreversibly bound. On the basis of studies with BH4-deficient Sf9-nNOS, we
later revised this interpretation to propose that nNOS has two identical
but highly anticooperative binding sites per dimer. From the present observations for the association and dissociation
rate constants, we can estimate values of 4–9 nM for the apparent
equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). As the enzyme is present in excess in the radiolabeling studies
(250 nM nNOS, 20 nM [3H]-BH4), these values should reflect
high-affinity binding only. The dissociation experiments at 37 °C
imply that this process is essentially reversible. The observation
that a significant fraction of [3H]-BH4 remained bound
after 24 h incubation with excess unlabeled BH4 or BH2 at 8 and 25
°C is intriguing, considering that only half of the pterin binding
sites is expected to exhibit tight binding. However, as mentioned
above, because of the large excess of NOS over [3H]-BH4,
all label should be bound with high affinity, and no heterogeneity
in BH4 dissociation is expected.

Whereas the radioligand binding
studies imply reversible high-affinity binding, the activity titrations
seem to suggest otherwise. No exchange of (tightly bound) pterin occurred
during the activity assays and in the experiments of Figure . In these cases, the apparent contradiction is
explained by the different time scales of the experiments: with a
dissociation rate constant at 37 °C of 0.017 min–1 one can estimate that exchange should occur with a half-life of
∼40 min, well beyond the time scale of the activity assays;
similarly, for the experiment of Figure  the
dissociation rate constant (&lt;0.003 min–1) implies
a half-life of 4 h or more. Less easy to explain is the fact that
the enzyme with 1 equiv of BH4 per dimer seems not be inactivated
by pterin autoxidation during overnight incubation. Assuming that
NOS-bound BH4 is protected from autoxidation, the apparent autoxidation
rate constant is expected to be the product of the actual autoxidation
rate constant (∼1 × 10–4 s–1 under the present conditions; see ) and the fraction of free BH4, which
in turn depends on the tight-binding BH4 dissociation equilibrium
constant (Kd) and the protein concentration
(∼10–8 M). As detailed in the  (Figure S5), the lack
of enzyme inactivation implies a Kd in
the picomolar range or lower. We arrived at similarly low upper estimates
for the Kd by different methods earlier., Most problematic is the observation that the activity due to tight
pterin binding is also retained when the enzyme is incubated overnight
with an excess of BH4. In view of the rate of BH4 autoxidation, this
procedure should result after ∼7 h in NOS with one tightly
bound BH4 in the presence of a large excess of autoxidized BH4. According
to the radiolabeling studies, and in clear contrast to the observations,
the enzyme ought to lose most tightly bound BH4 in the remaining incubation
time by exchange with autoxidized BH4 under these conditions.

In summary, the radiolabeling studies demonstrate that high-affinity
pterin binding is reversible, but the discrepancies between those
studies and the activity titrations suggest that the two series of
experiments may not be monitoring the same process. Clearly, further
studies will be required to resolve this issue.

Is High-Affinity
Pterin Binding Anticooperative?
A
second open question concerns the involvement of anticooperativity
in the generation of heterogeneous BH4 binding. This concept was also
based on analysis of the radioligand binding studies. Specifically,
BH4-containing and -deficient nNOS exhibited virtually identical [3H]-BH4 dissociation rates in the presence of Arg and unlabeled
BH4. As BH4-containing and -deficient nNOS were expected to have the
radioligand bound at the low- and the high-affinity site respectively,
this observation argued strongly in favor of two identical anticooperative
binding sites., Essentially identical binding
sites are also suggested by the fact that the two monomers are identical,
and crystallographic studies of pterin-bound NOS oxygenase domains
failed to show any major effect of BH4 or other pteridines on the
enzyme structure or any obvious differences between the two subunits.−

However, if the manifestation of heterogeneous BH4 binding
upon preincubation were the result of the emergence of anticooperativity,
one would expect the affinity of the low-affinity site to decrease
in the process. Instead, the EC50 values for the activation
of ECo-nNOS before and after overnight incubation with BH4 were similar,
which implies that preincubation does not modify the affinity of the
“low-affinity” site. Consequently, anticooperativity
may not be the origin of the heterogeneity of pterin binding.

Mechanistic
Considerations
Tight binding was accomplished
by tetra- but not by dihydropteridines. This is reminiscent of the
differential effects of tetra- and dihydropteridines on NOS activity,
with only the former supporting NO synthesis. Indeed, the inability of dihydropteridines to bind tightly suggests
a redox-mediated process. We therefore propose that the first equivalent
of BH4 that binds to nNOS is able to create one tight-binding site
by a process that involves redox chemistry. The other site is not
affected and binds a second equivalent of BH4 with unchanged affinity
(Scheme ). It is yet unclear why tight binding
is only accomplished for the first pterin, but one may speculate that
the Zn-binding site is involved, as it is the only unique structure
in the dimer., Moreover, it is close to both
pterin-binding sites and redox-sensitive. In view of the well-documented
role of the Zn-site in dimerization, it may therefore be relevant
that we observed formation of SDS-resistant dimers only with tetra-
and not with dihydropteridines. Further studies will be necessary
to clarify the mechanism of tight BH4 binding and why it allows only
one BH4 to be bound tightly per dimer.

Proposed Explanation
for Tight BH4 Binding to nNOS
Dimeric nNOS contains two
identical sites that bind BH4 with relatively low affinity, manifested
by a EC50 of ∼0.2 μM in the activity assays.
Binding of the first equivalent of BH4 causes a redox reaction that
results in very tight binding of the pterin. The reaction may involve
a unique site on the enzyme (the green dot in the scheme) that is
not too far away from both binding sites, perhaps the Zn-binding site
at the dimer interface. Upon tight binding of 1 equiv of BH4, this
site is no longer able to assist in tight binding of the second equivalent
of BH4 (illustrated in the scheme by the change in color from green
to red). Consequently, only 1 equiv of BH4 is tightly bound, with
the other site still exhibiting EC50 ≈ 0.2 μM.
The radioligand binding studies suggest that BH4 binding is fully
reversible, indicated by the short backward arrow in the middle of
the scheme. However, it is presently unclear if the phenomenon of
tight binding is covered by the radioligand binding studies under
the applied conditions. It is also unclear if dissociation of tightly
bound BH4, if it occurs, is accompanied by irreversible inactivation
and/or changes in the quaternary structure of the enzyme.

Physiological Implications
In recent
years, evidence
has been mounting for NOS uncoupling as an important factor in a range
of pathologies,− and BH4 deficiency or its oxidation to BH2 is assumed to be a leading
cause of uncoupling.− An important implication of the results of the present study is
that, at least in the case of the neuronal isoform, BH4 deficiency
or oxidation will never lead to complete NOS uncoupling, since only
enzyme that has never been exposed to BH4 at all will have no BH4
bound at its tight-binding site. Consequently, even under conditions
of severe oxidative stress NOS will still produce O2– and NO simultaneously. However, it should be stressed
that the present study was limited to nNOS. Notably, most studies
on the pathophysiology of uncoupling focused on eNOS,− with few studies involving nNOS.− It will therefore be
interesting to see if the results in this study can be extrapolated
to the other isoforms. Another important open question concerns the
relative rates with which BH4-containing and BH4-free subunits produce
their respective products. Although it is conceivable that NO and
O2– are produced with equal rates, other
stoichiometries are possible.

In
the laboratory, the observations reported here imply that, without
sufficient preincubation, results obtained with BH4-replenished recombinant
NOS derived from sources that do not synthesize BH4 (bacteria, yeast,
etc.) may not reflect the in vivo situation, since it takes some time
to induce tight binding. The observations reported here may also be
relevant for the studies by Tsai and co-workers, who took great pains
to remove excess BH4 from their samples, distinguishing between BH4
as a “ligand” and a “cofactor”., The present results suggest that those studies may have been performed
with preparations consisting mainly of dimers with one tightly bound
BH4.

Summary and Conclusions
Tight binding of approximately
1 equiv of BH4 per nNOS dimer is confirmed in the present study. The
phenomenon is not restricted to a specific expression system and does
not require a cellular environment. It is not evident in radioligand
binding studies, perhaps because of the far lower concentration of
(labeled) BH4 in those studies. Tight binding occurs with tetra- but
not with dihydropteridines, suggesting the involvement of redox chemistry.
One implication of this study is that, as isolated, recombinant nNOS
expressed in E. coli does not behave like the native
enzyme, since the tight pterin-binding site must first be created,
which takes place on a time scale of minutes. Another implication
is that, at least in the case of the neuronal isoform, NOS will never
be fully uncoupled, since only enzyme that is never exposed to BH4
at all will have no BH4 bound at its tight-binding site. Consequently,
even under conditions of severe oxidative stress NOS will still produce
O2– and NO simultaneously.
