The second messenger cAMP is
ubiquitously found in eukaryotic cells and regulates many cellular
functions, including cell growth, death, and metabolism. Synthesis of cAMP is regulated by G-protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) that couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins and modulate
the activity of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), which catalyze cAMP formation.
Hydrolysis of cAMP by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs)
and receptor desensitization influence the duration and extent of
the increase in the level of cellular cAMP. Alterations in the cAMP
signaling pathway occur in numerous settings, including in certain
cancer cells; this pathway is thus a potential target for cancer therapy., The actions of cAMP primarily occur via the activation of PKA, which
can promote the proliferation of certain cells but induces cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis in others.,, Even though PKA is the major mechanism for cAMP-mediated events
in eukaryotic cells, only a portion of the proteins that undergo PKA-mediated
regulation are known.

The CD4+/8+ S49 T lymphoma cell line,
derived from a BALB/c mouse
tumor, is a useful system for assessing the actions of cAMP. Treatments
that raise cellular cAMP levels produce G1-phase cell-cycle arrest
and then apoptosis in wild-type (WT) S49 cells., This
apoptotic response facilitated the isolation of cAMP-resistant clones
and has made S49 cells useful for investigating cAMP generation and
action. Kin- cells, a clonal, cAMP-resistant
S49 variant that lacks PKA activity and expression of the catalytic
subunit of PKA,− provide a null cell system for identifying cAMP/PKA-dependent responses.− Such responses include not only G1-phase cell-cycle arrest and mitochondria-dependent
intrinsic apoptosis but also induction of PDE and proteins that contribute
to apoptosis,,− and inhibition of expression of other proteins, including ornithine
decarboxylase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase,
and c-myc.,

Cyclic AMP acts via PKA to alter the
expression of many mRNAs in
WT, but not kin-, S49 cells and by inference in other eukaryotic cells. How those mRNA changes relate to effects of cAMP/PKA
on protein expression is unclear, especially because mRNA and protein
expression do not highly correlate (correlation coefficients between
the two range from 0.2 to 0.6,). Here we undertook
quantitative proteomics analysis to identify cAMP/PKA-mediated changes
in protein expression in S49 cells as a system for defining such changes
in mammalian cells.

Experimental Procedures
Growth of S49 Cells and Treatment with a cAMP Analogue or IBMX
and Fsk
WT and kin- S49 cells were grown in a suspension
culture in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) in
a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 at 37 °C.
Cells were incubated for 6 or 24 h with 100 μM 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP
(8-CPT-cAMP) (Sigma), a cAMP analogue that activates PKA. In addition,
we incubated WT S49 cells for 6 h with 100 μM IBMX, a PDE inhibitor,
and 10 μM Fsk, an AC activator, to increase endogenous levels
of cAMP. Cultures were initiated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/mL, and stock cells were maintained at a density of
&lt;2 × 106 cells/mL.

Cell Lysis, Protein Digestion, Peptide Labeling, and Mass Spectrometry
Analysis
Equal (100 μg) aliquots of proteins from WT
(treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP for 0, 6, and 24 h or incubation with IBMX
and Fsk for 6 h) and kin- S49 cells (treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP for
0 and 6 h) were lysed in 2% Rapigest, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), and protease
inhibitors. The proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with
trypsin at a protein:enzyme ratio of 100:1. The resulting peptides
were acidified, desalted, and labeled with different 8-plex isobaric
tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) reagents and combined. Half of the resulting peptide
mixture was loaded on a reverse-phase C18 column (RP1, 360 μm
outside diameter × 200 μm inside diameter, 5 μm Zorbax
SB-C18, 20 cm packing) using a pressure chamber and then
desalted. The peptides were eluted to a strong cation exchange column
[SCX, 360 μm outside diameter × 200 μm inside diameter,
5 μm Poly-SULPHOETHYL A (PolyLC, Inc.), 5 cm packing] online
using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA). The peptides on the SCX column were step-eluted to a C18 analytical
column with an integrated tip [RP2, 360 μm outside diameter
× 200 μm inside diameter, 5 μm Zorbax SB-C18 (Agilent
Technologies), 20 cm packing] with a series of salt gradients (38
steps). After each salt elution, the peptides were eluted (at a flow
rate of ∼500 nL/min) with acetonitrile (from 0 to 80% in 150
min) to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
San Jose, CA), which was operated under the data-dependent mode with
gas-phase fractionation with the full MS scan range divided into three
scan ranges (400–805, 800–1055, and 1050–2000).
Each MS scan (Orbitrap, 7500R) was followed by four pairs of pulsed
Q dissociation–collision-activated dissociation (PQD–CAD)
scans on the top four most abundant parent ions in LTQ. A dynamic
exclusion of 1 min was used. The capillary temperature was 150 °C.

Data Analysis
Spectrum Mill version 3.03 (Agilent Technologies)
was used to analyze the data and to identify and quantify peptides
and proteins. The CAD and PQD spectra from the same parent ion were
merged together and searched against the International Protein Index
mouse database (version 3.31, 56555 protein sequences). The peptides
were limited fully tryptic with a maximum of cleavage of 2. Other
parameters included the following: carbamidomethylation of cysteines,
static; iTRAQ modification on the N-terminus and lysine, differential; ±20
ppm for precursor ions; ±0.7 Da for fragment ions; minimal matched
percent scored peak intensity, 50%. We constructed a concatenated
forward–reverse database to calculate the false discovery rate
(FDR). Proteins with two or more unique peptides were selected for
quantitative analysis. To take into account database redundancy, we
grouped proteins with the same set or subset of unique peptides and
identified a “protein group leader”, which usually was
the protein with the largest number of peptides. Hereafter, the term
“protein” refers to this protein group leader.

For protein quantitation, we used three biological replicates and
calculated protein iTRAQ reporter ion intensities by summing the iTRAQ
reporter ion intensities of unique peptides for a given protein. We
corrected for isotope impurities of iTRAQ reagents by using correction
factors provided by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). A minimal
total iTRAQ reporter ion intensity (sum of two channels compared)
of 50 was used to filter out low-intensity spectra. The reporter ion
ratios were calculated and normalized to the median ratio. Conclusions
regarding a change in protein abundance required the following criteria
to be fulfilled: (1) The protein had to be quantified in at least
two data sets. (2) If the protein was quantified in all three replicates,
its abundance ratios had to be ≤0.67 or ≥1.5 in all
three replicates. (3) If the protein was quantified in only two data
sets, both had to yield abundance ratios of ≤0.67 or ≥1.5.
We opted not to use a t test for iTRAQ because that
test can be too stringent for identifying proteins with fold differences
that are biologically significant.

We used the DAVID 6.7 bioinformatics tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) for gene functional categorization
and pathway analysis. This tool provides gene annotation and gene
ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and highlights the most relevant
GO terms in a list of genes.

Immunoblot Analysis
To verify iTRAQ data, we used immunoblotting
to analyze the expression of glutathione reductase (Gsr), the expression
of which differed in WT and kin- cells under basal conditions, and
of Lgals7, a protein that we found is regulated by cAMP. Whole cell
lysates prepared from WT S49 cells under basal conditions or after
treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 and 24 h were separated by 4 to 12%
NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. We used the following antibodies:
rabbit polyclonal Gsr (H-120) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal
Lgals7 and rabbit polyclonal GAPDH (Abcam, Inc.), and mouse monoclonal
α-tubulin (Sigma). Protein expression was quantitated by densitometry
using ImageJ version 1.41o.

Cell Death Studies
WT and kin- S49 cells were incubated
for 16 h at 37 °C with 150 μM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, Fisher Scientific), 1 μM staurosporine
(Sigma-Aldrich), or an equivalent volume of water (Control) in a tissue
culture incubator in standard medium and in a 10% CO2/90%
air mixture. Cells were then prepared for Annexin V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(BD Pharmingen). We stained 2 × 105 cells in 5 μL
of Annexin V-FITC/5 μL of PI in a final volume of 100 μL
of the manufacturer’s buffer for 15 min at room temperature.
Stained cells were diluted with 400 μL of PBS and assessed using
a BD FACScan; files were analyzed using CellQuest. The data shown
are the percentages of cells that had high levels of staining with
both PI and Annexin V (death by both necrosis and apoptosis).

Malondialdehyde (MDA) Analysis
We assessed oxidative
stress by measuring the production of malondialdehyde, an index of
lipid peroxidation, using a Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances
(TBARS) assay (Cayman Chemical Co.) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, S49 cells were pelleted at 1000g and 4 °C for 10 min and resuspended in PBS at a density of
2 × 107 cells/mL. The cell suspensions were sonicated
three times for 5 s at 40 V on ice. Reaction mixtures were prepared
by mixing 100 μL of sample or MDA standard with 100 μL
of SDS solution and 4 mL of a thiobarbituric acid solution, placed
in a boiling water bath for 1 h and then on ice for 10 min, and warmed
to room temperature prior to duplicate 150 μL aliquots being
read at 530 nm in a microplate reader (Tecan US, Durham, NC).

Results
Proteomic Profiling of WT and kin- S49 Cells
Figure  shows the workflow we used for quantitative proteomics
analysis of WT and kin- S49 cells. We conducted this analysis in three
biological replicates using 8-plex iTRAQ labeling and identified and quantified the proteins with Spectrum
Mill. Using a 1% FDR cutoff for peptide identification, we identified
1591 proteins, 260 of which could be detected only with a single peptide.
We identified 1056 proteins if a 0.1% FDR cutoff was used for proteins
with a single peptide and a 1% FDR cutoff for proteins detected with
multiple peptides. To minimize the detection of false positives, we
used the latter criteria and required the detection of at least two
unique peptides for each protein. This more conservative approach
yielded 708 such proteins in S49 cells (Table 1 of the ). We obtained results
for WT and kin- S49 cells under basal conditions and after the cells
had been treated with the cAMP analogue, 8-CPT-cAMP, and for WT cells,
by also comparing the effect on protein expression in response to
incubation of cells with 8-CPT-cAMP, or Fsk with IBMX; the latter
treatment was used to increase endogenous cAMP levels in the cells.

Diagram
of the workflow of the proteomic studies. Proteins in wild-type
(WT) and kin- S49 cells were digested in three biological replicates
of cells (WT control, WT for 6 and 24 h with CPT-cAMP (100 μM)
treatment, WT incubated with 100 μM IBMX and 10 μM Fsk,
kin- control, and kin- cells incubated with 100 μM CPT-cAMP
for 6 h). The resulting peptides were desalted and labeled with different
iTRAQ reagents. The labeled peptides from each sample were pooled
and then separated with online 2D LC with PQD/CAD acquisition on an
LTQ-Orbitrap. Spectrum Mill was used to search the raw data for protein
identification and quantitation. The proteins whose level of expression
was increased or decreased were analyzed using the DAVID bioinformatics
tool.

Basal Protein Expression: Differences between WT and kin- S49
Cells
The absence of PKA activity in kin- S49 cells should
change the expression of proteins that contribute to “basal”
actions of cAMP required for cell viability, growth, and division.
We identified 19 proteins (12 upregulated and 7 downregulated in kin-
cells) that differed in their expression in WT and kin- cells (Table ). Proteins with increased levels of expression
in kin- cells are acidic (leucine-rich) nuclear phosphoprotein 32
family, member A (Anp32a), suppressor of Ty 5 homologue (Supt5h),
and thioredoxin 1 (Txn1); kin- cells have decreased levels of expression
of leucine-rich PPR-motif containing (Lrpprc) and mortality factor
4-like protein 2 (Morf4l2). kin- cells have decreased levels of expression
of the proteasome (prosome, macropain) 26S subunit, ATPase 3 (Psmc3),
and ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, Chr Y 1 (Ube1y1), while the level
of expression of Gsr is increased in kin- cells.

Proteins whose levels of expression
differ between kin- and WT S49 cells under basal (control, ctrl) conditions
are listed. The proteins are classified according to the DAVID bioinformatics
software. The data shown are the average ratios (kin- ctrl:WT ctrl)
from at least two biological replicates. The data for proteins whose
expression is increased in kin- cells are shown in bold; proteins
with decreased expression in kin- cells are shown in italics. Also
shown are the number of unique peptides identified for each protein
(unique_pep) and the number of PQD spectra (spectrum_num) used for
each protein quantitation.

To confirm the findings from the proteomic analysis,
we tested
the biologic role of Gsr, which has enhanced basal expression in kin-
cells. Immunoblot studies confirmed this result (Figure A). Incubation with H2O2 produced more
cell killing and generated more of the oxidative product malondialdehyde
in WT than in kin- cells (Figures B,C). These
findings imply that PKA suppresses Gsr expression in WT cells and
enhances their sensitivity to oxidative damage.

Enhanced glutathione
reductase expression and reduced sensitivity
to cell death and lipid peroxidation in response to H2O2 of kin- vs WT S49 cells. (A) Immunoblotting confirms data
from the proteomics analysis that kin- cell lysates have more glutathione
reductase than do WT S49 cell lysates (both 25 μg of protein/well).

cells, but this difference was not observed in cells incubated with
1 μM staurosporine. kin- cells also experienced less cell death
under control conditions (incubation with H2O for 16 h).
(C) A 16 h incubation at 37 °C with 150 μM H2O2 produced more lipid peroxidation, assessed as MDA,
in WT cells than in kin- cells. The data shown in panels B and C are

Comparison of Changes in Protein Expression between WT and kin-
S49 Cells Incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 h: cAMP/PKA-Dependent and
cAMP/PKA-Independent Changes in Protein Expression
Incubation
of WT S49 cells with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 h increased the expression of
16 proteins and decreased the expression of 9 proteins. Expression
of 21 of these 25 proteins was unchanged in similarly treated kin-
cells, and thus, these changes are cAMP/PKA-dependent. Treatment of
kin- cells with 8-CPT-cAMP changed the expression of 4 of these 25
proteins, three of which are cAMP/PKA-independent, as their expression
changed similarly in WT cells (Exosc7, exosome component 7; Thy1,
Thy-1 membrane glycoprotein precursor; Psme2, proteasome activator
complex subunit 2). The expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 [NAD+], gamma (Idh3g) produced opposite changes in WT and kin-
cells.

Table  lists proteins with changes
in the levels of expression in response to 8-CPT-cAMP and their functional
classifications by bioinformatic analysis. These include increased
expression in WT cells of proteins involved in coenzyme metabolic
processes and altered expression (both increase and decrease) of certain
proteins that modify chromatin or are involved in protein transport.
Thus, on the basis of differences between WT and kin- S49 cells, cAMP
appears to regulate many metabolic processes, chromatin modifications,
and protein transport pathways in a PKA-dependent manner.

Proteins whose levels of expression
change in WT or kin- S49 cells incubated with CPT-cAMP for 6 h are
listed. The proteins are classified according to the DAVID bioinformatics
software. The data shown are the average ratios (WT CPT 6 h:WT ctrl
or kin-CPT 6 h:kin- control cells) from at least two independent experiments.
The proteins whose levels of expression increased and decreased upon
treatment are shown in bold and italics, respectively. Also shown
are the number of unique peptides identified for each protein (unique_pep)
and of PQD spectra (spectrum_num) used for protein quantitation. The
PKA-independent proteins (i.e., whose expression changes in the kin-
cells following a 6 h incubation with CPT-cAMP) have two numbers in
the average ratio column. The ratios upon CPT-cAMP treatment for 6
h in kin- cells (kin- CPT 6 h:kin- Ctrl) are shown in parentheses.

Changes in Protein Expression in WT Cells Incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP
for 24 h
Incubation of WT cells with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h
altered the expression of 30 proteins (10 decreasing and 20 increasing)
(Table ). Bioinformatics analysis revealed
that these include proteins involved in the regulation of the cell
cycle, response to stress, protein transport, and transcription. In
terms of molecular function, eight proteins bind purine nucleotides
(seven are ATP binding proteins) and three are metal ion binding proteins.
Treatment with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h decreased expression of several
transport proteins but increased expression of multiple proteins that
regulate transcription or bind ATP. Incubation with 8-CPT-cAMP of
WT cells for 24 h thus has more widespread effects on protein expression
than does incubation for 6 h. Of note, WT S49 cells that have increased
cellular levels of cAMP for 24 h undergo arrest in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle; such cells then begin to undergo mitochondria-dependent
intrinsic apoptosis.,

Changes in Protein Expression in WT S49 Cells Incubated with
Fsk and IBMX for 6 h
A 6 h incubation of WT S49 cells with
Fsk and IBMX, which stimulate membrane ACs and inhibit PDEs, respectively,
and prominently increase intracellular cAMP levels in S49 cells,, decreased expression of 10 proteins and increased that of 14 proteins
(Table ). Changes in expression were noted
for proteins involved in protein transport or regulation of transcription
and include those classified as cofactor binding proteins and adenyl
nucleotide binding proteins. Such changes in protein expression likely
contribute to the response of S49 cells to increases in the level
of endogenous cAMP.

Changes in Protein Expression in S49 WT Cells Incubated with
8-CPT-cAMP or Fsk with IBMX
Comparison of the proteins expressed
in response to a 6 h treatment of WT S49 cells with 8-CPT-cAMP, or
Fsk with IBMX, revealed 10 proteins with similar directional changes
(seven increasing and three decreasing) (Figure ), while in cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h or with Fsk
and IBMX for 6 h, six proteins had similar such changes (four increasing
and two decreasing). We identified 14 proteins with similar responses
(nine increasing and five decreasing) in cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP
(6 or 24 h) or Fsk and IBMX. Those 14 proteins include ones involved
in coenzyme binding and regulation of transcription. Overall, the
results indicate that treatment of S49 WT cells with 8-CPT-cAMP, or
Fsk with IBMX, have some similarities but also several differences
in their impact on the S49 proteome.

Comparison of Data Derived from DNA Microarray and Proteomics
Analyses
DNA microarray data are available for 196 of the 708 proteins identified in this study of
S49 cells. We compared the two data sets in terms of the responses
of WT S49 cells treated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 and 24 h relative to
expression of control WT cells. We found no correlation (r2 &lt; 0.001) between the two data sets in cells incubated
with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 h. By contrast, the correlation coefficient
between the DNA microarray data and proteomic studies was 0.41 for
WT cells incubated for 24 h with 8-CPT-cAMP and 0.42 between the DNA
microarray data of cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 h and the
changes in protein expression after incubation with 8-CPT-cAMP for
24 h. Among the 196 proteins quantified in both DNA microarrays and
proteomics, eight proteins had similar directional changes in cells
incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 or 24 h.

Immunoblot Analysis of Lgals7 in WT Cells Incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP
Immunoblot analysis of WT S49 cells (control or after treatment
with 8-CPT-cAMP for 6 and 24 h) showed an increase in the level of
expression of Lgals7, especially at the 24 h time point, confirming
the data obtained by iTRAQ (Figure ).

Immunoblot
analysis of Lgals7 in WT S49 cells. Proteins from control
WT cells and WT cells incubated with CPT-cAMP for 6 and 24 h were
analyzed by immunoblotting as described in . α-Tubulin was used as a loading control.
The data shown are from two separate experiments.

Discussion
The goal of this study was to use S49 lymphoma
cells to define
the cAMP/PKA-regulated proteome. We compared protein expression of
WT and kin- S49 cells under basal culture conditions and assessed
the impact of increases in the level of cAMP in WT S49 cells by a
cAMP analogue or by increasing the level of endogenous cAMP via activation
of AC and blockade of PDE. Using a conservative approach for protein
detection, we identified 708 proteins, some of which exhibited changes
in expression in response to increases in the level of cAMP. Classification
of these proteins by a bioinformatics tool revealed different categories,
GO terms, and pathways for cAMP/PKA-dependent events, many of which
have not been previously known.

WT and kin- S49 cells differ
in their levels of expression of 19
proteins under basal conditions: five such proteins are classified
in the biological process subcategory “regulation of transcription”
and three in the subcategory “adenyl nucleotide binding”.
Txn1 and Gsr, which both have higher basal expression in kin- cells,
are involved in protection of cells from oxidant-induced injury and
can influence cell proliferation and apoptosis., The greater expression of Txn1 and Gsr in kin- cells implies that
cAMP and PKA inhibit their expression in WT cells. Gsr, an enzyme
of cellular antioxidant defense, reduces oxidized glutathione disulfide
(GSSG) to GSH. The results (Figure ) provided
independent evidence that Gsr protein expression is greater in kin-
cells than in WT cells and that kin- cells are less sensitive to oxidative
stress, implying that PKA inhibits Gsr expression under basal conditions
and enhances the sensitivity to oxidative damage. By contrast with
the results indicating greater expression of Txn1 in kin- cells, increases
in the level of cAMP induce Txn1 and extend survival
of retinal pigment epithelial cells in a PKA-dependent manner. The contrasting results in retinal pigment epithelial
cells and S49 cells suggest that cAMP and PKA can have opposite effects
on the expression of Txn1 in different cell types but that its enhanced
expression increases the rate of cell survival.

We assessed
time-dependent changes in protein expression in S49
cells in response to increases in the level of cAMP to identify proteins
that may be primary targets of cAMP/PKA (at an earlier, 6 h, time
point) while proteins with altered expression after 24 h likely include
secondary ones. We identified 22 potential primary targets that had
altered expression in WT but not kin- S49 cells incubated for 6 h
with 8-CPT-cAMP. Such proteins are involved in protein transport,
chromatin modification, and coenzyme metabolism (Table ). Among the three proteins associated with chromatin modification,
expression of Huwe1and Nasp decreased in WT cells. Nasp is required
for DNA replication, cell-cycle progression, and cell proliferation
and interacts with histones., Previous data have
implied a role for cAMP/PKA in regulating histone modifications and
chromatin structure (e.g., ref ()).

WT S49 cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h
have altered expression
of proteins involved in biological processes that include cell-cycle
regulation (Calr, calreticulin; Cep192, centrosomal protein 192; Ywhah),
cellular response to stress (Ruvbl2, RuvB-like protein 2; Pcna, proliferating
cell nuclear antigen; Supt16h), and regulation of transcription. Calr
can modulate gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors and also has extracellular functions, e.g.,
tumor and apoptotic cell recognition and wound healing., Cep192 regulates centrosomes. The Ywhah
gene encodes 14-3-3 η; because 14-3-3 can be anti-apoptotic, perhaps the decrease in the level of expression
of 14-3-3 η influences cAMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis of S49 cells. The cell cycles of one-cell stage mouse fertilized
eggs and cycling Xenopus egg extracts are accompanied by a decrease
in cAMP concentration and PKA activity at the onset of mitosis and
transition between mitosis and the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Such
findings suggest that the changes in protein expression that we observe
in S49 cells may occur in other cells in which cAMP and PKA regulate
cell-cycle progression.

Among the three proteins classified
as “cellular response
to stress” is Ruvbl2, a component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase
complex that contributes to the transcription of certain genes by
acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A. The NuA4 complex can influence DNA repair and may activate
transcriptional programs associated with oncogene-mediated growth
induction, tumor suppressor-stimulated growth arrest, replicative
senescence, and apoptosis. We found that
cAMP/PKA activation decreases expression of Pcna; of note, low levels
of Pcna are associated with apoptosis.

Lgals7 has the greatest increase in expression of all the
proteins
we identified in WT S49 cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h.
As a pro-apoptotic protein that functions
upstream of JNK activation and cytochrome c release, Lgals7 may contribute to cAMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis
in WT S49 cells., We also found sustained changes
in certain transport proteins in response to 6 and 24 h incubations
of WT S49 cells with 8-CPT-cAMP. Cyclic AMP/PKA-dependent pathways
influence transport proteins in many cell types (e.g., Sf9 and COS-7 and HEK293 cells).

Increases in cellular cAMP levels might perturb cellular function
via PKA or by Epac or CNG channels, other effectors of cAMP action. kin- cells provide a means to identify proteins
whose expression is PKA-dependent and does not require activation
of Epac. We found numerous differences in basal protein expression
and in the effects of increases in the level of cAMP on protein expression
in WT cells compared to kin-S49 cells (Tables –). Such proteins include those involved
in coenzyme binding and regulation of transcription. A role for cAMP/PKA
in transcription is well-known (e.g., refs () and ()). DNA microarray analysis of WT S49 cells incubated with
8-CPT-cAMP for 24 h reveals changes in ∼33% of the transcriptome. We find that changes in the transcriptome are
concordant with those in the proteome in cells incubated with 8-CPT-cAMP
for 24 h but not 6 h, likely reflecting the delay in protein synthesis
that follows changes in mRNA expression. In addition, increases in
the level of cAMP may influence protein expression through effects
on protein translation (e.g., ref ()).

As part of efforts to validate discovery-
and target-based protein
quantification using iTRAQ and PQD, Wu and co-workers recently reported
a change in expression of certain proteins in WT and kin- S49 cells
treated with 8-CPT-cAMP for 4 h. They
identified 18 proteins with basal differences in expression between
WT and kin- cells, three of which were only identified by the target-based
approach. We identified 10 of the 15 proteins that Wu et al. quantified
using the discovery-based approach. We found three of the same proteins
(LOC100041831 similar to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
LOC633016 similar to chromobox homologue 3 isoform 2, and Snd1 staphylococcal
nuclease domain-containing protein 1) in two of our three data sets
that changed as observed by Wu et al; in one of our three data sets,
we identified three other proteins (glycyl-tRNA synthetase, Mthfd2
bifunctional methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase,
and RuvB-like 1) with changes akin to those noted by Wu et al. (Table
1 of the ). Wu et
al. found that a 4 h incubation of WT cells with 8-CPT-cAMP altered
expression of three proteins, while we identified 22 such proteins
in WT cells incubated with this analogue for 6 h (Table ). One of the three proteins identified by Wu et al. (T-complex
protein subunit β) had similar changes in two of our three data
sets. Thus, the data from Wu et al. are similar to our findings, but
there are some disparities, which likely reflect several differences
between their studies and ours, including the duration of the treatment
of cells with 8-CPT-cAMP, sample processing protocols, and criteria
for identifying changes in protein expression.

Previous studies
reported that cAMP/PKA increases the level of
expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-2α (CTLA-2α)
and Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) in WT S49 cells., We did not detect changes in these low-abundance proteins, because
our analytical procedure favors detection of more abundant ones. S49
cells have large nuclei relative to their amount of cytoplasm; detection
of some proteins is thus more difficult than with other cell types.
Cyclic AMP/PKA-promoted apoptosis of S49 and other immature lymphoid
cells occurs via mitochondria-mediated events., Thus, it will be of interest to conduct proteomics analysis of mitochondria
of S49 cells following increases in the level of cAMP and activation
of PKA. In addition, an important future direction will be to conduct
phosphoproteomics analysis in these cells. Recent studies have shown
that cAMP and PKA target important structural, regulatory, and transporter
proteins in rat inner medullary collecting duct cells. Comparisons of cAMP/PKA-regulated proteins in different
cell types should thus prove to be important in terms of identifying
proteins that are shared “targets” versus those that
are unique to particular cell types.
