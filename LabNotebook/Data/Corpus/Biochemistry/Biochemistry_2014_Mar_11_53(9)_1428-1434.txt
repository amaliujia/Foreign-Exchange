The cytochrome P450s (CYPs)
are thiolate-ligated heme-containing monooxygenases that oxidize many
different functional groups or hydrocarbons, and they play critical
roles in biosynthetic pathways, or detoxication, in virtually every
organism., CYPs are both drug targets and major components
of drug metabolism. In the ferric, resting enzyme, the heme cofactor
of different CYPs equilibrates between the five-coordinate high spin
state and the six-coordinate low spin state, defined by the constant Kspin = [high spin]/[low spin].− A water molecule, or molecules, in the active site provide(s) the
sixth ligand to the low spin heme iron., The Kspin in the resting state is CYP isoform dependent,
although the molecular basis for the differences is unknown. In many
cases, binding of substrates results in displacement of the water
and conversion to higher fraction of five-coordinate high spin heme
with a higher redox potential, and this allows for one electron reduction
by NADPH-dependent protein redox partners to begin the catalytic cycle,
as elegantly described originally by Sligar et al., Whereas
biosynthetic CYPs typically exhibit tight coupling of substrate binding
and spin state conversion, hepatic isoforms that dominate drug metabolism
exhibit poor coupling; different drugs or substrates yield different
fractions of high spin heme with variable spin state equilibria., Although the substrate-dependent spin state regulation for some
CYPs is well documented, the molecular basis for the variability in
the substrate-free ferric spin equilibrium has not been determined.
For example, substrate-free CYP3A4 is only ∼19% high spin but
exhibits an unexpectedly high rate of heme reduction in the absence
of any bound substrate. In contrast,
CYP2E1 and CYP125A1 are significantly high spin even in the absence
of substrates., These examples amplify our incomplete
understanding of the role of spin state in CYP catalysis, and they
suggest that the local ligand field of the substrate-free low spin
state is a source of variability in CYP isoform-dependent spin state
control.

The ligand field of the substrate-free states is also
important
in drug design aimed to inhibit CYPs. Differences in axial ligand
field of the substrate-free CYPs necessarily contribute to differential
binding affinities of drugs that target the heme, such as antifungal
azoles or anticancer drugs such as anastrozole or abiraterone., To the extent that axial water “competes” for heme
ligation with these drugs, the energy of the water-iron bond contributes
to the apparent binding affinity of the drug. This aspect of CYP inhibitor
design has not been acknowledged. Here we demonstrate, for substrate-free
states, significant differences in the energies of porphyrin-to-metal
near-infrared (nIR) charge transfer (CT) bands among CYP51B1 and CYP125A1
from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and partially solubilized
forms of human hepatic CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and CYP2C9.

Materials and
Methods
Protein Sample Preparation
Buffer salts were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Deuterium oxide (99% D2O) and glycerol (98%, -d8) were purchased
from Cambridge Isotopes (Andover, MA). CYP3A4 was expressed and purified
as previously described. CYP2C9 (hepta
mutant) was constructed as previously described with the exception of a hexa His rather than a tetra His
C-terminal sequence to facilitate purification. The enzyme was expressed
in DL39 Escherichia coli and purified as described
for CYP3A4. CYP2E1 was received as a generous gift from the lab of
Dr. Emily Scott (University of Kansas). CYP51B1 from M. tuberculosis (Mtb) was purified as previously described. CYP125A1, also from Mtb, was prepared as previously described.

For measurement of conventional absorbance
spectra, protein samples were diluted directly from their respective
storage buffer into 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH = 7.4) containing
10–20% glycerol. The final protein concentration ranged from
1 to 6 μM based on CYP450 content, as determined using the methods
of Omura and Sato (note: to normalize
the CYP51B1 spectrum, the published molar extinction coefficient at
419 nm of 134 mM–1 cm–1 was used). For EPR spectral acquisitions, the proteins
were concentrated to &gt;100 μM CYP450 in the same buffer. For
MCD samples, the protein sample buffer was sufficiently exchanged
for deuterated phosphate to avoid contamination of unwanted C–H,
N–H, and O–H vibrational overtones in the near-infrared
spectral region. Deuterated buffers were prepared using 1 M potassium
phosphate (pD = 7.4–7.5) stock solution that was dissolved
and lyophilized three times in D2O. The proteins were concentrated
(&gt;250 μM) several times in deuterated buffer containing 20%
glycerol-d8, using Centriprep (Millipore)
30 MWCO centrifugal filters before adding an additional 35% glycerol-d8 as a glassing agent to yield a final buffer
concentration ranging from 100 and 200 mM phosphate depending on the
solubility of the isoform, + 55% glycerol-d8. CYP450 content was measured for each sample solution immediately
prior to acquisition of MCD spectra. The final protein concentrations
utilized for MCD were 400 μM CYP3A4, 262 μM CYP2E1, 475
μM CYP2C9, 700 μM CYP125A1, or 770 μM CYP51B1.

Magnetic Circular Dichroism
MCD spectra were collected
using an Aviv 40DS spectropolarimeter and a high-field superconducting
magneto-optical cryostat (Cryo-Industries SMC-1659 OVT) equipped with
a variable-temperature sample compartment. MCD intensities are measured
as differential absorbance of left (σ–) and
right (σ+) circularly polarized light (ΔA = AL – AR), following the sign convention of Piepho and Schatz. MCD spectra are measured in units of θ
(mDeg) with the relationship, θ (mDeg) = 32982*ΔA. All spectra were baseline corrected via measurement and
subtraction of a spectrum collected at zero field. For cryogenic temperature
measurements (4.2–4.7 K), depolarization of the sample was
verified to be less than 10% prior to sample data collection via CD
measurement of a solution standard of nickel(II) tartrate. Near infrared
absorption was detected with a nitrogen-cooled 1 × 1 mm InGaAs
detector (Sciencetech Inc., USA). Visible spectra were collected from
500 to 850 nm in 2 nm steps using an integration time of 2 s and bandwidth
of 4 nm; nIR spectra were collected from 900 to 1500 nm in 5 nm steps,
2 s integration time, and a bandwidth of 10 nm. Measurements at room
temperature are expressed as Δε (M–1 cm–1 T–1) to account for the
field dependence, while measurements at cryogenic temperature are
expressed as Δε (M–1 cm–1). Preparation of a sample for MCD was performed by depositing 90
μL of protein solution upon a 1.5 cm diameter circular quartz
plate placed on an in-house fabricated aluminum sample mount fitted
with a 0.1 cm thick Teflon spacer. The solution was sealed between
a second quartz plate and sandwiched between an aluminum housing with
hand-tightened screws. The sample mount was secured to a rod containing
a temperature sensor fit for the appropriate optical cryostat before
being introduced in between the poles of the superconducting magnet.

EPR Spectroscopy and Calculation of Axial (Δ/λ)
and Rhombic (V/λ) Crystal Field Terms
Conventional
continuous-wave (CW) EPR spectra were measured on a Bruker ELEXSYS
E540 X-band spectrometer with ER 4102 ST resonator and either a liquid
nitrogen quartz insertion dewar or a Bruker ER 4112 HV helium flow
cryostat. The samples were placed in 3 mm outer diameter (OD) EPR
tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to acquisition at temperatures
between 15 and 77 K. Accurate spectral g-values were
obtained by fitting the CW-EPR spectra using EasySpin software, a
toolbox contained within the MATLAB environment.

Calculation of the axial (Δ/λ) and rhombic
(V/λ) crystal field terms expressed in units
of the spin–orbit coupling constant (λ) for ferric ion
was performed via the methods of Taylor. Briefly, the fitted g-values obtained via least-squares
regression analysis in EasySpin were applied to the following formalism:

UV/vis Absorbance Analysis and Determination of Kspin
Absorbance measurements were conducted at
25 °C on an Olis Modernized Aminco DW-2 (Olis, Inc., Bogart,
GA) dual beam spectrophotometer equipped with a Julabo F30-C compact
refrigerated circulator (Julabo USA, inc., Allentown, PA). Each binding
experiment required 500 μL initial sample volume using a 0.1
× 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. The spectra were subjected
to a least-squares fitting algorithm written in the Python programming
language and adapted for use in IGOR Pro 6.1 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego,
OR).

Results
UV/vis Spectra of Substrate-Free CYPs
Standard UV/vis
spectra of several CYP isoforms, in the wavelength range typically
used to monitor ligand binding, are shown in Figure . To calculate the fraction of enzyme in the high spin state
and the value of Kspin for each ligand-free
CYP, the absorbance spectra were fit to experimentally derived basis
spectra for the pure high spin, low spin, and P420 species as determined
by principle component analysis and described previously.,Kspin was then calculated by the relation: Kspin = [% high spin]/[% low spin]. The Kspin values are summarized in Table , along with MCD parameters determined in experiments
described below. The UV/vis spectrum of each of these CYPs is essentially
identical to previous results in the literature. The unusually high
fraction of high spin heme with ligand-free CYP125A1 and CYP2E1 has
been well established,, as is the preponderance of low
spin heme for the other CYPs. We report the results here for all of
the proteins as the basis for direct comparison within a single data
set.

Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD)
MCD was used to compare
the low spin states of these CYPs in greater detail. Although MCD
has been used to characterize some soluble CYPs, microsomal CYPs have
not been characterized, presumably due to difficulty in obtaining
purified protein at the high concentrations required for investigation
of the near-infrared (nIR) charge transfer (CT) transitions (∼400
μM). The temperature-dependent (C-term) nIR CT bands observed
by MCD uniquely report on the axial and rhombic distortion of the
heme iron ligand field in the low spin state, without overlapping
bands from high spin electronic transitions.− Unlike visible absorption bands,
this spectroscopic feature reports exclusively on the low spin structure,
and it is much more sensitive to rhombic strain. This MCD marker is distinct from, although similar to,
the EPR gz values and
derived axial (Δ/λ) and rhombic (V/λ) crystal field
terms that describe the ferric low spin heme ligand field.,, The MCD spectra of substrate-free,
partially solubilized, engineered variants of human CYPs and bacterial
isoforms acquired between 4.2 and 4.7 K at 6 T field are shown in
Figure . A striking difference in the wavelength
maxima and overall spectral shape is apparent. The corresponding spectra
at 298 K are also shown in Figure , and the
data are summarized along with the absorbance data in Table . There is a remarkable absence of low spin signal
for CYP125A1 at the higher temperature consistent with its large fraction
of high spin heme, even with no ligand present. At the lower temperature,
which is known to favor the low spin heme, we were able to detect the low spin nIR transition of CYP125A1.
We were unable to obtain spectra at the high temperature for CYP2C9
for unknown reasons. Regardless, the increase in low spin heme observed
at low temperatures by other methods is also observed in these MDC
spectra, for several isoforms. Thus, at room temperature the differences
in ligand field are less pronounced than at low temperatures.

and CYP2E1 at 4.2–4.7 K and 6 T. Bottom: 6 T near nIR MCD spectra
of CYP3A4, CYP125A1, CYP51B1, and CYP2E1 at 298 K. Note that the predominantly
high spin nature of CYP125A1 at 298 K (red) precludes measurement
of the low spin transition. All samples were prepared in 100–200
mM KPi (pH = 7.4) + 55% glycerol-d8.

The difference in energy of the
CT transitions is substantial (range
ΔΔG = 1.9 kcal/mol at ∼4.2 K;
ΔΔG = 1.2 kcal/mol at 298 K) and is likely
due to differences in energy of the low lying iron t2g (dyz) orbitals into which the pyrrole nitrogen
π electrons are promoted from both a1u and a2u HOMOs (Scheme ). It is unlikely that the differences result from changes
in porphyrin molecular orbitals. The different energies of the MCD
transition indicate that the sixth axial water ligand provides increasing
ligand field strength in the order CYP2E1
&gt; CYP51 &gt; CYP2C9 &gt; CYP3A4 ≈ CYP125A1 (Table ). This is the first documentation of nIR MCD for
any human
CYPs and the rather remarkable differences in ligand field among substrate-free
CYPs despite the common axial ligand, H2O. It is widely
presumed that the thiolate axial ligand is sufficiently “dominant”
to render the axial water ineffective in controlling the axial field
strength. Mutations can modestly shift the nIR transitions of ligand-free
CYPs, but shifts of 50–80 nm typically require ligand substitution.,

Schematic Free Energy Profile of the Macroscopic Kspin and the Differences in the Low Spin States Revealed
by MCD
The right side includes the
porphyrin HOMOs and the iron d-orbitals with ligand field parameters V and Δ indicated. The nIR charge transfer band energies
for different CYPs correspond to different axial ligand field strengths
in the relative order shown, with CYP2E1 and CYP125A1 having the strongest
and weakest axial ligands, respectively. The lack of LFER between Kspin and these ligand field energies suggests
a contribution of the high spin states to isoform-dependent differences
in Kspin.

In addition
to the nIR MCD data, we collected spectra in the region
of the α,β bands near 650 nm at 298 K. In this region,
a negative intensity MCD band at ∼650 nm is assigned as a LMCT
(S(π) → Fe3+) transition () that is uniquely diagnostic for the presence of high spin
heme. In addition to this MCD feature, the spectra shown in Figure  include several additional Cys thiolate (S–) → Fe3+ charge transfer bands originating
from the high spin species that distinguish the two spin states in
the CYP MCD spectrum. Clearly, the CYP2E1
and CYP125A1 yield the largest high spin intensity, as expected. Interestingly,
the spectral minima for these isoforms are significantly different
with CYP125A1 and CYP2E1 having minima at 652 and 658 nm, respectively.
The weak signals from CYP3A4 and CYP51B1 yield minima at ∼650
and 652 nm, respectively. Thus, the apparent strength of the thiolate
ligand in the high spin species increases in the order CYP2E1 &gt;
CYP51B1
&gt; CYP3A4 ≈ CYP125A1. Because of the weak high spin signals
for some of these isoforms, we note that this ranking is approximate.
However, it is clear that the ligand field of these isoforms is also
modestly different in the high spin state. The range of energies for
these isoforms at 298 K is ΔΔG = 0.5
kcal/mol, which is much less than the range observed for the low spin
axial field strength.

The 6 Tesla MCD spectra of the α,β region
acquired
at 298 K for CYP3A4, CYP2E1, CYP51B1, and CYP125A1 reveals large differences
in high spin content. The negative MCD feature centered ∼650
(inset) is only present in high spin CYPs and represents thiolate
→ Fe(III) LMCT for the high spin enzyme.

EPR Spectra and Comparison to MCD
The CW EPR spectra
of the substrate free CYPs 3A4, 51B1, 125A1, and 2C9 were measured.
The normalized spectra are shown in Figure . We observed results directly analogous to those previously reported
for many CYPs, and the data are summarized in Table . The EPR spectra clearly indicate low spin, H2O-ligated heme in each case. The crystal field parameters for rhombic
(Δ/λ) and axial (V/λ) distortion
are included.

the calculation of crystal field terms.

In
addition, the EPR parameters were used to calculate the expected
energies for the nIR MCD transitions, according to the method of Gadsby
and Thomson. The predicted and experimentally
measured energies are compared in Figure .
The results emphasize the discrepancy between the predicted MCD transitions
based on EPR parameters and these experimental results, for these
thiolate-heme proteins. The experimental EPR parameters poorly predict
the MCD transitions for all the isoforms except CYP3A4.

predicted based on the EPR-derived axial (Δ/λ) and rhombic

and Thomson. Note: no EPR data are available
for CYP2E1. The results emphasize the inaccuracy of low spin ligand
field energy calculations based on EPR correlations for these CYPs
and the necessity for direct measurement of the nIR CT transition
by MCD.

Discussion
This
work extends a vast array of previous spectroscopic work by
many laboratories to characterize the ferric spin states of CYPs.
The major new information here includes a direct comparison by MCD
and EPR of several CYP isoforms including human CYPs that historically
have been inaccessible to study by MCD spectroscopy. Although low
spin complexes of CYPs with heteroatomic ligands such as azoles, thiols,
or alcohols in the sixth axial position have been characterized by
MCD and EPR, the H2O-bound structures have not received
detailed scrutiny. In fact, these MCD spectra are the first of any
human CYP and provide the first clear evidence that their ligand fields
in the resting states differ from each other and from some bacterial
CYPs, corresponding to differences in the strength of the axial Fe3+–H2O bond. The temperature dependence of
the CT transition further amplifies the differences in resting states
of these isoforms. Whereas CYP3A4 and CYP51B1 exhibit either a spectral
blue shift or no shift upon increasing the temperature from 4.2 to
298 K, CYP2E1 yields an unusual red shift. Further studies are needed
to explain the differential temperature dependence, but the temperature
effects highlight the fundamental difference of water-ligated states.

These differences have functional implications for the energetics
of substrate-dependent or inhibitor-dependent shifts in the ferric
spin equilibrium. A common strategy for the design of CYP inhibitors
is to incorporate azole or pyridine fragments aimed to displace the
axial H2O and form iron–nitrogen coordinate bonds.
The net gain in free energy of inhibitor binding depends not only
on the strength of the resulting iron–nitrogen bond but also
on the energy that is forfeited in the Fe3+–H2O that must be displaced. The results here indicate that identical
fragments could have modestly different intrinsic binding affinities
for different CYP isoforms simply because the resting states of these
enzymes vary in the strength of the starting Fe3+–H2O bond. It will be important to understand further the mechanism
for these significant differences in ligand field and how the protein
architecture and solvation contribute.

Differences in the ligand
field in the high spin state of the substrate-free
enzymes are also evident, albeit with a much narrower range of energies
in the proximal Cys (S–) → Fe(III) bond.
This is evident in Figure . The range in energies
for these high spin transitions is only ∼0.4 kcal/mol, and
presumably reflects subtle differences in second sphere hydrogen bonding
to the proximal cys thiolate as well as other subtle environmental
factors. Because of the low intensity of the MCD bands in the α,β
region, and the contribution of multiple electronic transitions to
these spectral features, we are cautious to not assign relative energies
of the axial thiolate ligand on their basis. However, the very modest
differences in ligand field we observe for these high spin transitions
are unlikely to drive the larger differences in ferric spin equilibrium
between these CYP isoforms.

It is, however, striking that the
overall Kspin values do not correlate with the strength
of the axial Fe3+–H2O bonds of the low
spin states (Table ); there is no linear free
energy relationship (LFER) between Kspin and the low spin axial ligand field energy. For example, CYP2E1
has an unusually high fraction of high spin ferric heme in the absence
of substrate, and the lowest energy CT transition, but CYP125A1 is
also largely high spin with the highest energy CT band. Together,
these observations emphasize that the ferric spin equilibrium is not
controlled solely by the strength of the axial water interaction in
the low spin state. Apparently, modest compensatory differences in
other features of the low spin or high spin states contribute to the
macroscopic Kspin. Possibly, differences
in Kspin reflect differences in solvent
accessibility to the heme. For example, facile water access to the
heme in CYPs with low Kspin values may
push the ferric spin equilibrium to the low spin state even though
the resulting Fe3+–H2O bond may be less
stable. Alternatively, isoforms with restricted access to very hydrophobic
active sites may favor a high Kspin value
even though the resulting Fe3+–H2O bond
is very strong. Speculatively, although, the microenvironment differentially
tunes the water-dependent ligand field when water is present, differences
in protein architecture and solvation control access of water to the
heme and hence the ferric spin equilibrium.

It is important
to mention a potential caveat of this work. Whereas
the CYP125A1 was purified by methods previously shown to yield ligand
free enzyme by crystallography, the CYP2E1 preparation conceivably
includes a ligand carried through the purification procedure, since
we do not have a crystal structure from that preparation. However,
because several other laboratories have documented a large fraction
of high spin enzyme from CYP2E1 purified by different methods, we
suggest that our preparation is ligand free and that it has an inherently
high fraction of high spin heme, as observed by others. We acknowledge
the possibility that our preparation includes some ligand that induces
a high spin component, although we observe no other indication of
an active site bound ligand. Regardless, even if some ligand was bound
to CYP2E1, it would not alter the conclusion that ferric spin equilibrium
is not correlated with strength of water ligation. Similarly, regarding
the results with the CYP2C9D mutant, we emphasize that this mutation
is modestly structurally different than the wild type CYP2C9 in crystal
structures, although the mutant binds and metabolizes ligands with
similar catalytic properties. Thus, the details of the ligand field
of the mutant may not be identical to the wild type. However, the
mutant provides a valuable additional variant with a ferric spin equilibrium
distinct form other isoforms used here, and it is expressed and soluble
at sufficient levels to obtain the high concentrations of protein
required for MCD.
