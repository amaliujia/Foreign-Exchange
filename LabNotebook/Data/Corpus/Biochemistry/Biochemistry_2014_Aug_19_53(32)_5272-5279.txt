In an O2- and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent reaction, nitric oxide synthase
oxidizes l-arginine to l-citrulline and the important
signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). Mammals
produce three NOS isoforms: neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS),
and endothelial NOS (eNOS). Each isoform participates in fundamental
physiological functions in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular
systems. The over- and underproduction
of NO is associated with various disease states; consequently, the
development of NOS inhibitors is an important therapeutic goal. The focus of our research efforts, has been the development of nNOS selective inhibitors that can be
used in treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s,
Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. Isoform selectivity, however, is critical because blocking
eNOS would interfere with the role NO plays in maintaining vascular
tone and blood pressure.

Achieving
high isoform selectivity has been a challenge because
the active sites of all three NOS isoforms are very similar.− Our previous work showed that a single
amino acid difference, Asp597 in nNOS versus Asn368 in eNOS, is responsible
for the ability of nNOS to bind a series of dipeptide inhibitors much
more tightly than does eNOS., Accumulated structural
information formed the basis for a fragment-based inhibitor design
approach resulting in pyrrolidine-containing inhibitors, which showed
excellent potency and selectivity for nNOS over eNOS.

Chirality at the 3′ and 4′ positions
of compounds
such as 1 (Table ) proved to
be critically important for both potency and selectivity. (3S,4S)-1 has the aminopyridine
positioned in the active site where it interacts with Glu592 of nNOS,
while Tyr706 is in its in-rotamer position. However, the more potent
and selective (3R,4R)-1 binds in a 180° flipped mode with the aminopyridine
moiety H-bonding to heme propionate D and Tyr706 adopting an out-rotamer
conformation to make this binding mode feasible (Figure )., These two binding possibilities
have been achieved with a single compound that bears double-headed
aminopyridine groups., We have recently developed more
pyrrolidine-based nNOS inhibitors, such as compounds (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 in
Table , that target heme propionate D and
exhibit 2000- and 1400-fold selection for nNOS versus eNOS, respectively. The crystal structures revealed that these inhibitors
interact with heme propionate D in nNOS with a conformation different
from that in eNOS, mainly because a conserved Tyr residue, Tyr706
in nNOS versus Tyr477 in eNOS, is able to adopt an out-rotamer conformation
more easily in nNOS than in eNOS. This movement of the conserved Tyr
is necessary to allow the inhibitor aminopyridine group to form tight
bifurcated H-bonds with heme propionate D. The aim of this study is
to determine whether the Tyr rotamer position is the sole determinant
of isoform selectivity and identify the structural basis underlying
the Tyr rotamer preference in nNOS versus eNOS.

binding of 1 to nNOS depending
on the chirality at positions 3′ and 4′ of the pyrrolidine.

Experimental
Procedures
Preparation of Bovine eNOS L111A and Y477A and Rat nNOS H341L
and M336V/D597N Mutants
Three different point mutations,
eNOS L111A, eNOS Y477A, and nNOS H341L, were prepared by the QuikChange
protocol (Stratagene) via polymerase chain reaction using the pCWori
vector as the template, which contains the gene of the corresponding
full length wild type eNOS or nNOS. The resulting plasmids with the
mutation were confirmed by sequencing of the entire coding region.
The preparation of the rat nNOS double mutant, M336V/D597N, was as
reported previously. Protein expression
and purification of these full length eNOS or nNOS mutants were conducted
using the established procedure reported previously., The heme domain samples used for structural studies were generated
by limited trypsinolysis of full length eNOS or nNOS, and the resulting
fragments of the heme domain and FAD-containing domain were further
separated by a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, as described previously.,

Inhibitor Complex Crystal Preparation
The rat nNOS
heme domain (9 mg/mL, containing 20 mM histidine) or the bovine eNOS
heme domain (12 mg/mL, containing 2 mM imidazole) was used for sitting
drop vapor diffusion crystallization. Diffraction quality crystals
were obtained after incubation for 2 days at 4 °C over the following
reservoir solutions: for nNOS, 20–24% PEG3350, 100 mM MES (pH
5.8), 140–200 mM ammonium acetate, 10% ethylene glycol, 5 mM
GSH, and 35 μM SDS; for eNOS, 18–22% PEG3350, 100 mM
cacodylate (pH 6.0), 150–200 mM magnesium acetate, and 5 mM
TCEP. Fresh crystals were first passed stepwise through cryoprotectant
solutions as described previously, and then soaked
with 10 mM inhibitor for 4–6 h at 4 °C before being flash-cooled
with liquid nitrogen.

Spectral Binding Constants
In addition
to the known
inhibitory constants (Ki in Table ) obtained with the wild type rat nNOS or bovine
eNOS full length enzymes, we also determined the spectral binding
constants of inhibitors bound to the heme domain, wild type or mutants,
which are the same samples used to obtain crystal structures. All
of the inhibitors in this study are high-spin, type I inhibitors.
The buffer consisted of 50 mM HEMES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, and 100
mM NaCl, containing 1 mM imidazole (a low-spin, type II ligand). Inhibitor
binding displaces the imidazole, resulting in a well-defined shift
in the spectrum from low- to high-spin. The spectral shift was monitored
for a few minutes at room temperature after each addition of increasing
amounts of inhibitor to 5–6 μM protein. The differences
in absorbance between the peak (390 nm) and trough (430 nm) were plotted
against the inhibitor concentration. The data showing weaker binding
to eNOS were usually fit well using SigmaPlot (Systat Software Inc.)
with a hyperbolic one-site ligand binding equation. However, for inhibitors
that bound more tightly to nNOS, a quadratic equation was needed for
better fitting (Figure S1 of the ). The apparent Ks constants [Ks(app)] were further
converted to Ks via the equation Ks(app) = Ks(1 +
[imidazole]/Kd,imidazole) and are listed
in Table . The Kd values of imidazole for nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS are 160 μM, 150 μM, and
42 μM, respectively.

X-ray Diffraction Data Collection, Data Processing,
and Structural
Refinement
The cryogenic (100 K) X-ray diffraction data were
collected remotely at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource
(SSRL) or Advanced Light Source (ALS) through the data collection
control software Blu-Ice and a crystal
mounting robot. Raw CCD data frames were indexed, integrated, and
scaled using HKL2000. The human iNOS
diffraction data were collected at BL11-1 of SSRL using a Pilatus
pixel array detector. The finely sliced (0.2° per frame) and
highly redundant (160° in scanning angle) data were processed
with XDS and scaled with Scala. Binding of inhibitors was detected by the initial
difference Fourier maps calculated with REFMAC. The inhibitor molecules were then modeled in COOT and refined using REFMAC. Disordering in portions
of inhibitors bound in the NOS active sites was often observed, sometimes
resulting in poor density quality. However, partial structural features
usually could still be visible if the contour level of the sigmaA-weighted
2m|Fo| – D|Fc| map dropped to 0.5σ,
which afforded the building of reasonable models into the disordered
regions. Water molecules were added in REFMAC and checked by COOT.
The TLS protocol was implemented in the
final stage of refinements with each subunit as one TLS group. The
omit Fo – Fc density maps were calculated by repeating the last round
of TLS refinement with the inhibitor coordinate removed from the input
PDB file to generate the map coefficients DELFWT and PHDELWT. The
refined structures were validated in COOT before deposition in the
PDB. The crystallographic data collection and structure refinement
statistics are summarized in Table S1 of the , with the PDB codes included.

Results and Discussion
Binding
of (3R,4R)-Pyrrolidine
Inhibitors to nNOS
Chemical structures of the compounds discussed
in this study as well as their inhibitory potencies and selectivities
are listed in Table . To directly correlate
the ligand binding affinity and the binding mode found in structures,
the spectral binding constants of four compounds with various heme
domain proteins are listed in Table . Compared
to the parental inhibitor (3R,4R)-1, both (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 have the tail
end hydrophobic phenyl ring replaced with a pyridine ring to introduce
hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and protein. These two inhibitors
show good potency and high selectivity for nNOS over eNOS (Table ). As we have reported, the two (3R,4R)-inhibitors, 2 and 3, bind to nNOS (Figure ) with the aminopyridine ring hydrogen bonded to heme propionate
D and stacked with the Tyr706 side chain in its out-rotamer position.
The pyridine ring at the other end of the inhibitor hydrogen bonds
with Glu592. There are some variations with respect to how the pyrrolidine
ring interacts with the protein. For (3R,4R)-2 (Figure A), the pyrrolidine ring bends down between heme propionate
A and H4B, thereby hydrogen bonding to both through its
ring nitrogen atom. This pyrrolidine binding position is identical
to what has been observed for parental inhibitor (3R,4R)-1. The pyrrolidine nitrogen atom occupies the position
of a water molecule present in the substrate complex structures for
both nNOS and eNOS (PDB entries 1OM4 and 2NSE). In the nNOS–3 structure
(Figure B), however, this water molecule is
still present, while the pyrrolidine of (3R,4R)-3 bends up but contacts
the water molecule. Overall, (3R,4R)-3 adopts a more extended conformation
in the linker between the tail pyridine and the pyrrolidine rings,
so that the position of the aminopyridine is at least 0.5 Å farther
from the nNOS active site than that observed in the nNOS–1 structure. Another difference between (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 is
the orientation of the tail pyridine ring. In the nNOS–2 structure, the ring is approximately parallel to heme pyrrole
A, while the ring in the nNOS–3 structure makes
an ∼30° tilt from the heme plane. This is most likely
because the extra methyl group on the pyridine in (3R,4R)-3 imposes additional
restraints on the ring orientation via its van der Waals contact with
the Phe584 side chain. This additional contact may have created a
binding affinity of (3R,4R)-3 slightly tighter than that of (3R,4R)-2.

(3R,4R)-3 (PDB entry 3UFV()). The omit Fo – Fc density
map for each inhibitor is shown at the 3.0σ contour level. Major
hydrogen bonds are depicted as dashed lines.

Binding of (3R,4R)-Inhibitors
to eNOS
Although (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 also bind to eNOS (Figure ) with the aminopyridine ring next to heme propionate
D, Tyr477 remains in place and does not adopt the out-rotamer position
as it does in nNOS. Therefore, the aminopyridine is able to form hydrogen
bonds with only one oxygen atom of heme propionate D, whereas the
2-amino group forms an H-bond with Asn340. The pyridine in the tail
of either inhibitor makes a hydrogen bond with Glu363 similar to that
seen in nNOS. The inability to form direct bifurcated H-bonds with
the heme propionate D in eNOS is likely the main reason why (3R,4R)-2 and
(3R,4R)-3 bind to eNOS more poorly than to nNOS (Tables  and ). Both exhibit the weakest binding
to eNOS among the compounds in this study, judging by both Ki and Ks (Tables  and ), while (3R,4R)-2 gives
the highest isoform selectivity. A concern was raised during the review
about whether it is valid to correlate the inhibitory data (Ki), which were determined at pH 7.5 and room
temperature, using full length enzymes, directly with the heme domain
crystal structures obtained at lower pH values (pH 5.8 for nNOS and
pH 6.0 for eNOS) and liquid nitrogen temperature (100 K). The spectral
binding constants (Ks) determined with
the heme domain protein at pH 7.5 and room temperature show a consistent
trend with inhibitory Ki values, which
indicates that the enzyme–inhibitor interaction and the accessibility
of the inhibitor to the NOS active site are very similar, whether
it is in the full length enzyme or the heme domain alone. The NOS
heme active site has a wide open channel, which allows the soaking
of small molecules into NOS crystals without crystal damage. The temperature
issue is hard to address because the NOS crystal structures at room
temperature are not available. The pH effects may not be a concern
because the comparison of binding of the ligand to nNOS and eNOS is
made in the same pH range (∼6.0).

for each inhibitor is shown at the 3.0σ contour level. Major
hydrogen bonds are depicted as dashed lines.

More Examples of Isoform-Dependent Binding Modes
Similar
isoform-dependent inhibitor binding modes have been observed with
other inhibitors. We have reported that
(3R,4R)-4 and (3R,4R)-5 bind to nNOS (Figure S2 of the ) in a double-headed mode with each of the heads
hydrogen bonded with either the Glu592 side chain or heme propionate
D. With eNOS, however, the two inhibitors do not form bifurcated hydrogen
bonds to heme propionate D with the aminopyridine; instead, the aminopyridine
stacks with the Tyr477 side chain that itself remains in the in-rotamer
position to hydrogen bond with heme propionate D (Figure S3 of the ), which is similar to
how (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 bind to eNOS (Figure ). We
recently also reported pyrrolidine-based inhibitor (2R,4S)-6, which provides
another example. In nNOS, (2R,4S)-6 makes hydrogen
bonds with both aminopyridine rings, one to Glu592 and the other to
heme propionate D (Figure S4A of the ). However, in eNOS, one aminopyridine hydrogen
bonds with Glu363, but the second aminopyridine does not hydrogen
bond with heme propionate D because Tyr477 does not rotate out of
the way (Figure S4B of the ).

Is the Tyr Position the Sole Determinant for Inhibitor Binding?
The common structural feature with these inhibitors is that the
conserved Tyr adopts the out-rotamer conformation in nNOS, thus allowing
one aminopyridine to form the bifurcated hydrogen bonds with heme
propionate D, while in eNOS, the Tyr remains in the in-rotamer position.
To determine if the Tyr side chain position is the sole determinant
of the isoform-dependent inhibitor binding mode, we have prepared
the eNOS Y477A mutant and determined crystal structures of the mutant
bound with two inhibitors that do not disturb the Tyr477 rotamer in
wild type eNOS. As shown in Figure A, the
binding mode of (3R,4R)-3 is the same as that in wild type eNOS (Figure B); that is, the aminopyridine makes only one hydrogen
bond with heme propionate D. The only difference is that the void
left by the smaller side chain of Ala477 allows the aminopyridine
ring to fill in the space, thereby losing its hydrogen bond to Asn430
(Figure A).

(A) (3R,4R)-3 and (B) (2R,4S)-6.
The omit Fo – Fc density map for each inhibitor is shown at the 3.0σ
contour level. Major hydrogen bonds are depicted as dashed lines.

In contrast, the structure of
eNOS Y477A bound with (2R,4S)-6 provides a
clear-cut case in which the Tyr477 side chain alone fully controls
how (2R,4S)-6 binds, while in wild type eNOS, (2R,4S)-6 cannot hydrogen bond
with heme propionate D because the Tyr477 side chain blocks the position
of heme propionate D. When the Tyr side chain is absent in the Y477A
mutant, (2R,4S)-6 is able to take the place of Tyr477 (Figure B). This resembles the binding mode observed in
the nNOS–6 structure (Figure S3A of the ) but lacking the stacking
interaction between the aminopyridine ring and the Tyr side chain.
Interestingly, the determinations of Ks (Table ) indicate that being able to make
bifurcated H-bonds from the aminopyridine to heme propionate D alone
does not increase the affinity of (2R,4S)-6 for eNOS Y477A compared to that
of wild type eNOS. This implies that stacking of the aminopyridine
ring with the Tyr side chain in its out-rotamer position also contributes
to the binding of (2R,4S)-6, which is the case in the nNOS–6 structure (Figure S3A of the ). Removing the Tyr side chain does not lead to
tighter binding even though it allows the inhibitor’s aminopyridine
to H-bond with heme propionate D. Rather, allowing the Tyr to adopt
an out-rotamer position is the key to better binding affinity for
inhibitors discussed in this study.

Reasons for the Different
Tyr Mobilities
What remains
to be explained is why the highly conserved Tyr residue, among different
species and across the NOS isoforms, is more mobile in rat nNOS than
in bovine eNOS. The protein environment near the Tyr is different
in the two isoforms, with Met336 in nNOS versus Val106 in eNOS being
one of the more obvious differences. When the aminopyridine hydrogen
bonds with heme propionate D, Met336 is able to form more extensive
contacts with the inhibitor in nNOS than would be possible for Val106
in eNOS. This could help to provide the energetic incentive for the
conserved Tyr to move away in nNOS. In addition, the larger Met336
in nNOS may make it less favorable because of steric crowding of the
inhibitor, such as (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3, preventing adoption of the extended
conformation, as observed in eNOS. To test this interpretation, we
determined the structures of (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 bound to the nNOS M336V/D597N
mutant that mimics eNOS. There is very little difference in the way
(3R,4R)-2 binds to the mutant and wild type with the exception of the pyrrolidine
moiety (Figure A). More complex is how (3R,4R)-3 binds
to the nNOS mutant (Figure B). Two alternate
conformations are required to properly model the electron density
for the aminopyridine and pyrrolidine rings. One conformation is the
one already observed in the wild type nNOS–3 structure
with the pyrrolidine ring extending out and the aminopyridine forming
bifurcated hydrogen bonds with heme propionate D. The other conformation
is the same as that seen in the eNOS–3 structure
with the aminopyridine hydrogen bonded with both heme and Asn340.
The Tyr706 side chain must have two alternate rotamer conformations
to accommodate the inhibitor’s aminopyridine moiety in two
different positions (Figure B). Although the
Met to Val substitution indeed has some impact on how the inhibitor
interacts with the enzyme, we observed slightly weaker binding of
(3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3 to the nNOS M336V/D597N mutant (Table ), but inhibitor binding conformations in the nNOS M336V/D597N mutant
do not fully mimic inhibitor conformations in the eNOS–2 or −3 structure.

Active site of the nNOS
M336V/D597N mutant bound with (A) (3R,4R)-2 and
(B) (3R,4R)-3. The aminopyridine and pyrrolidine moieties in (3R,4R)-3 adopt
two conformations (yellow and pink) in nNOS. The Tyr706 side chain
also has two conformations to accommodate the inhibitor. The omit Fo – Fc density
map is contoured at 3.0σ for each inhibitor. Major hydrogen
bonds are depicted as dashed lines.

What complicates the mobility of the conserved Tyr is that
an extended
segment of disordered polypeptide in both eNOS and nNOS (residues
339–349 in nNOS or residues 109–120 in eNOS) differs
in both sequence and length and thus could also contribute to dynamical
differences in eNOS and nNOS. In the eNOS–3 structure
and a few others, we were able to observe density for a few more residues,
and thus, we could model Arg109–Leu111 in the usually disordered
region, as shown in Figure . In addition,
with some inhibitors, this region is visible in electron density maps
of nNOS. One example is the nNOS structure (PDB entry 4JSH) where the normally
disordered segment was fully modeled with the 2Fo – Fc density contoured
at 0.5σ (Figure ). The backbone of the
loop in nNOS resembles the fully ordered region observed in the human
iNOS structure (PDB entry 1NSI); that is, residues from Pro338 to Thr342 form a 310 helix. This additional information shows that the backbone
of this N-terminal portion in eNOS heme domain is packed more tightly
against the C-terminal fragment where Tyr477 is located. Additional
mutants in this region suggest that it is indeed how the backbone
packs near the conserved Tyr but not specific amino acid differences
that control the Tyr rotamer conformation. For example, Leu111 in
eNOS is in position to possibly clash with the out-rotamer conformation
of Tyr477, but the eNOS L111A mutant in complexes with (3R,4R)-3 or (3R,4R)-5 shows
that Tyr477 remains in place and does not adopt the out-rotamer conformation
(Figure S5 of the ). The Ks of (3R,4R)-3 with eNOS L111A shows
a binding affinity 7-fold tighter than that of wild type eNOS (Table ). Even though this mutation does not impact the
Tyr477 side chain rotamer position, it may affect inhibitor binding
by providing a distorted packing between the N-terminal portion and
the Tyr477-residing C-terminal fragment that lines up the active site
entrance. Another interaction unique in nNOS is His341 (Leu in eNOS),
which H-bonds with heme propionate D; this could possibly weaken the
Tyr706–heme propionate interaction, thus allowing Tyr706 to
more easily adopt the out-rotamer conformation. However, Tyr706 in
the H341L mutant complexed with (3R,4R)-2 or (2R,4S)-6 still adopts the out-rotamer
conformation (Figure S6 of the ) just as it does in wild type nNOS. We did see weaker binding of
(2R,4S)-6 to the H341L mutant of nNOS compared to that of the wild type in
the Ks measurement, but the binding is
still tighter than that to eNOS (Table ),
which is consistent with the double-headed binding observed in the
nNOS H341L–6 structure.

nNOS–3 structure (purple,
shown as one subunit only) on the eNOS–3 structure

in nNOS vs Pro336–Asp371 in eNOS). In nNOS, the loop after
Pro338 is invisible, while in eNOS, the loop is ordered up to Leu111,
as indicated by the 2Fo – Fc density contoured at 0.8σ. Different
binding conformations of (3R,4R)-3 are shown with the Tyr residue swung out
(nNOS, purple) or not (eNOS, green). The potential steric clash between
Leu111 and Tyr477 in its assumed out-rotamer position is indicated
by an arrow.

Segment adjacent to the
Tyr706-residing fragment. The normally
disordered polypeptide (residues 339–349) becomes partially
ordered in certain nNOS structures (PDB entry 4JSH). The 2Fo – Fc electron density
is contoured at 0.5σ around the 310 helix in the
segment.

One final example supporting the
conformational mobility of the
polypeptide and not specific amino acid differences as the key factor
controlling the mobility of the conserved Tyr stems from the structure
of human iNOS complexed with 7. As noted, the backbone
conformation of the polypeptide in this region is the same in both
nNOS and iNOS, but in iNOS, this region is fully ordered with well-defined
electron density. When 7 binds to nNOS, Tyr706 adopts
the out-rotamer conformation, but in iNOS, the corresponding Tyr491
remains in place (Figure ). Indeed, if Tyr491
were to adopt the out-rotamer conformation, there would be potential
steric clashes with Thr126 unless the Thr126 segment would move, which,
apparently, does not happen in iNOS. Interestingly, Tyr491 of iNOS
is more resistant to the out-rotamer position than is Tyr477 in eNOS
because, when 7 binds, both Tyr477 in eNOS and Tyr706
in nNOS adopt an out-rotamer position to allow one of the two aminopyridines
of 7 to form bifurcated H-bonds with heme propionate
D, as shown in Figure S7 of the . Note, too, that 7 is a more potent inhibitor of iNOS
than of eNOS but not of nNOS. We previously have shown that there
is greater electrostatic stabilization of 7 bound to
nNOS than eNOS because of a single amino acid difference: Asp597 in
nNOS is Asn368 in eNOS (see Figures  and ). This residue is
Asp382 in iNOS, which explains why 7 is ∼6-fold
better at inhibiting iNOS than eNOS. However, 7 is an
∼95-fold better inhibitor of nNOS than of iNOS. Because the
electrostatic properties of iNOS and nNOS are so similar, the better
potency of 7 for nNOS supports the view that the ability
of the Tyr to adopt the out-rotamer conformation in nNOS plays a major
role in inhibitor potency. The two main reasons why the out-rotamer
conformation results in better potency are that H-bonds between the
inhibitor aminopyridine and heme propionate are optimized and aromatic
stacking occurs between the Tyr out-rotamer conformation and inhibitor
aminopyridine.

map is contoured at 3.0σ for the inhibitor. Major hydrogen bonds
are depicted as dashed lines. The second aminopyridine of 7 is far from heme propionate D, which itself makes an H-bond with
Tyr491 in an in-rotamer position.

Conclusions
The Tyr706 side chain in nNOS can easily
adopt an out-rotamer position
when pyrrolidine-based inhibitors bind to the active site, while Tyr477
tends to remain in place in eNOS structures. The structural basis
for this isoform-dependent difference in Tyr mobility cannot be attributed
to any single residue in the often disordered region near the conserved
Tyr. The backbone structure of this region is basically the same in
nNOS and iNOS based on the available information. Even so, in iNOS
this region exhibits well-defined electron density and clearly is
more highly ordered than in nNOS. The out-rotamer position of the
conserved Tyr requires flexibility in this region, which happens to
be rigid in iNOS. This segment, however, adopts a different backbone
structure in eNOS compared to iNOS and nNOS, and despite the relatively
high mobility of this region, the polypeptide is closer to the conserved
Tyr in eNOS, thus presenting a greater energy barrier to the conserved
Tyr adopting the out-rotamer conformation. In addition, the Met336
(nNOS) to Val106 (eNOS) substitution can influence the binding of
inhibitors such as (3R,4R)-2 and (3R,4R)-3. These different binding modes in nNOS and eNOS, caused by the Tyr
residue mobility, have proven to be the basis for the sharp differences
in inhibitor potency (Table ). Therefore,
the mobility of this Tyr residue can be utilized in the future development
of isoform selective NOS inhibitors.
