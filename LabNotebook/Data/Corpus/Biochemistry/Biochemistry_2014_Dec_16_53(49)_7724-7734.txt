Structural models of the fibrils
formed by the 40-residue amyloid-β
(Aβ40) peptide in Alzheimer’s disease typically consist
of linear polypeptide segments, oriented approximately perpendicular
to the long axis of the fibril, and joined together as parallel in-register
β-sheets to form filaments. However, various models differ in
the number of filaments that run the length of a fibril, and in the
topological arrangement of these filaments. In addition to questions
about the structure of Aβ40 monomers in fibrils, there are important
unanswered questions about their structure in prefibrillar intermediates,
which are of interest because they may represent the most neurotoxic
form of Aβ40. To assess different models of fibril structure
and to gain insight into the structure of prefibrillar intermediates,
the relative solvent accessibility of amino acid residue side chains
in fibrillar and prefibrillar Aβ40 preparations was characterized
in solution by hydroxyl radical footprinting and structural mass spectrometry.
A key to the application of this technology was the development of
hydroxyl radical reactivity measures for individual side chains of
Aβ40. Combined with mass-per-length measurements performed by
dark-field electron microscopy, the results of this study are consistent
with the core filament structure represented by two- and three-filament
solid state nuclear magnetic resonance-based models of the Aβ40
fibril (such as 2LMN, 2LMO, 2LMP, and 2LMQ), with minor refinements,
but they are inconsistent with the more recently proposed 2M4J model. The results
also demonstrate that individual Aβ40 fibrils exhibit structural
heterogeneity or polymorphism, where regions of two-filament structure
alternate with regions of three-filament structure. The footprinting
approach utilized in this study will be valuable for characterizing
various fibrillar and nonfibrillar forms of the Aβ peptide.

Fibrils composed
of amyloid-β
(Aβ) peptides are the most abundant component of the senile
plaques that are pathognomonic of Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
one of the many diseases associated with fibril-forming peptides and/or
proteins.1 The molecular pathogenesis of
AD is an area of active study, and Aβ fibrils are such a consistent
histopathological feature of AD that understanding their structure
is likely to be an important step in understanding the pathogenesis
of AD.

Early fiber diffraction studies of amyloid fibrils from
amyloid-laden
tissue revealed a meridial reflection at 4.75 Å, corresponding
to the characteristic interstrand distance in a β-sheet, and
an equatorial reflection at ∼10 Å, thought to represent
the distance between two separate β-sheets.2−4 Solid state
nuclear magnetic resonance (SS-NMR) studies have delineated the extent
of the two β-sheets and demonstrated that the segments comprising
them are arranged in parallel and in register,5,6 findings
that have been confirmed by EPR with extrinsic labels,7 one-dimensional infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,8 and two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy.9

Several structural models of Aβ fibrils
have been proposed
to relate the two β-sheets to each other, and to the overall
morphological appearance of fibrils observed in transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) studies. Two early models based on studies of the
40-residue form of Aβ (i.e., Aβ40) represented fibrils
as a pair of “filaments” (defined as linear arrays of
peptides linked in β-sheets via hydrogen bonds)10 with axial symmetry. These models [Protein Data Bank (PDB)
entries 2LMN and 2LMO,
collectively herein termed 2LMN/O]11 differ
principally in “stagger”, i.e., the degree to which
the two β-sheet-forming segments of a single peptide are displaced
from each other along the fibril axis. Additional SS-NMR studies,12 mass-per-length determinations,13 X-ray diffraction studies,14 and computer simulations15 have led to
models composed of three filaments and a hollow core structure (PDB
entries 2LMP and 2LMQ),
again differing principally in stagger (collectively herein termed
2LMP/Q). The possibility that fibrils may have either two or three
filaments is variously termed plasticity, polymorphism, or heterogeneity
of Aβ40 fibrils.16 A recent study
of fibrils grown from “seeds” derived from two different
human brains afflicted with AD suggests that structural polymorphism
among Aβ40 fibrils is pathogenically significant.17 Of the two cases, the one with an atypical clinical
presentation yielded fibrils with a distinct morphology, and a distinct
set of low-energy three-filament conformers (PDB entry 2M4J).

While these
models are the most detailed to date, they were developed
with relatively few experimental constraints compared to the complexity
of the system. As a result, the 10 superimposed low-energy conformers
for each chain of the fibril models (2LMN/O and 2LMP/Q) display large
structural variations between conformers, and the N-terminal regions
are not included in the models as they are presumably disordered.
In this situation, a topological study of fibril structure by hydroxyl
radical footprinting (HRF) and mass spectrometry is useful to test
these models and to determine if structural constraints obtained for
fibril samples in water are compatible with models that rely on data
obtained from samples prepared for SS-NMR. 

The fibrils that
form in AD are composed of Aβ proteins that
vary in length because of imperfect specificity in the γ-secretase
that determines their C-terminus, and various N-terminal truncations.
It is not known how prevalent each length is in the fibrils of AD,
and the relative prevalence of various lengths may well vary between
individuals. In any case, Aβ40 is invariably a major if not
predominant component of the fibrils in AD, and fibrils made solely
from synthetic Aβ40 were the basis for the structural models
that we consider herein. Therefore, the fibrils examined by HRF in
this work were prepared solely from synthetic Aβ40.

HRF
is performed by exposing an aqueous protein sample to hydroxyl
radicals generated by various means. In this study, synchrotron X-rays
are used to create hydroxyl radicals (•OH) through
radiolysis of water. Amino acid side chains are modified by these
radicals at rates that are proportional to their solvent accessibility
but also a function of side chain reactivity. Modification rates are
determined by plotting the extent of side chain modification, quantified
by mass spectrometry, versus X-ray exposure time.18 HRF has become a powerful method for developing and refining
structural models of macromolecules and their complexes, especially
when the relevant functional states are not amenable to crystallographic
or NMR-based methods, and when solution state information is desirable.19−22

Two aspects of the HRF technique applied in this study yielded
important analytical advantages. The first aspect is that fibrils
were digested by pepsin after irradiation to generate a nested set
of overlapping segments spanning the entire length of Aβ40.
These segments were separated by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography
to achieve chromatographic separation of the oxidized isomers and
provide assessments of solvent accessibility at the level of individual
residues, in contrast to the peptide-level resolution typical in most
footprinting studies to date.23,24 The availability of
overlapping segments also provides multiple readouts for many of the
residues, providing greater confidence in the rate measurements. The
second aspect is that the results from fibrillar and prefibrillar
Aβ40 digested after irradiation were compared to results from
Aβ40 digested before irradiation. This “predigested”
Aβ40 yielded baseline modification rates for side chains in
the context of minimally structured segments while preserving the
sequence context of the residues of interest. Rates for predigested
Aβ40 were divided by the rates observed for side chains in fibrillar
and prefibrillar Aβ40 to obtain a “protection factor”
for each residue representing the degree to which the side chain solvent
accessibility of a residue is altered upon assembly into prefibrillar
and fibrillar Aβ40 states. Protection factors normalize the
modification rate data for differences in side chain reactivity, and
yield a measure of structurally important differences in solvent accessibility
of the Aβ40 states at the single-residue level. These two aspects
of the HRF technique applied herein have some precedent in hydrogen–deuterium
exchange (HDX) studies.25−28

The HRF results described below provide solvent
accessibility data
in the form of experimental protection factors for 16 of the 40 residues
of Aβ40 in low-molecular weight (LMW) prefibrillar aggregates,
and in mature fibrils. Results from Aβ40 fibrils are consistent
with the core filament structure identified in both the two- and three-filament
structures by SS-NMR. As such, this study represents an important
test of the core filament structure proposed by SS-NMR studies. HRF
results also provide evidence of ordered structure in two segments
of Aβ40 fibrils that remain undefined by SS-NMR, namely, the
eight N-terminal residues and the five-residue loop consisting of
residues 25–29. The single-residue data from HRF, coupled to
the normalization approaches provided by the protection factor assessments,
will be useful in characterizing various fibrillar and nonfibrillar
forms of the Aβ peptide and in improving our understanding of
structure–function relationships in the pathophysiology of
Alzheimer’s disease.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Hexafluoroisopropanol
(HFIP) was obtained
from Fluka and glass distilled prior to use. Formic acid (FA, 98%)
was also obtained from Fluka. Ruthenium-tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)
dichloride, (Ru(byp)3)Cl2, and ammonium persulfate
(APS) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant HFIP-purified
ultrapure Aβ40 (rAβ40) was obtained as a lyophilized powder
from rPeptide (Athens, GA). Synthetic Aβ40 was custom synthesized
and purified to &gt;95% by the Small-Scale Peptide Synthesis Facility
in the Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New
Haven, CT).

Seed Formation
Fibril seeds were
prepared from rAβ40
without further purification. Lyophilized powder (100–200 μg
aliquots) was dissolved in acidified HFIP (40% HFIP in 5 mM HCl) and
relyophilized overnight to disaggregate oligomeric and fibrillar forms.
It was then reconstituted in 5–10 μL of 1% NH4OH and bath sonicated for ∼30 s (model 1510, Branson, Danbury,
CT). This solution was diluted to a concentration of 30 μM in
incubation buffer [30 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) and 0.01% NaN3] and stored at 37 °C in polypropylene tubes without agitation
for at least 3 weeks to allow fibril formation. To remove low-molecular
weight forms of Aβ40 after incubation, solutions were washed
twice by centrifugation at &gt;10000g for 45 min
and
replacement of the supernatant with the same buffer. Fibril formation
was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with negative
staining (ammonium molybdate). Suspended fibrils were bath sonicated
for 3 min to break the fibrils into short fragments that subsequently
served as seeds.16

Determination of the Purity
of Synthetic Aβ40
Synthetic Aβ40 in powder form
was dissolved in 0.1% NH4OH and assayed for protein concentration
in three ways: a
bicinchoninic acid assay, tyrosine absorbance at 280 nm, and mass
spectrometric determination of Ala, Val, and Leu in an acid hydrolysate.
All three methods showed the material to be 65–70% protein
by weight, with the balance presumably water and/or salts. The purity
of the protein component was determined by two different high-performance
liquid chromatography methods. Method 1 involved a 4.6 mm × 250
mm reversed phase Vydac MS C4 column, mobile phase A composed of 0.1%
NH4OH in water, mobile phase B composed of 0.1% NH4OH in acetonitrile (1/200 in volume), a flow rate of 700 μL/min,
and detection by absorption at 215 nm. The gradient program was 0%
B from 0 to 8 min, with a linear increase to 60% B at 40 min. Method
2 involved a 4.6 mm × 250 mm reversed phase Varian PLRP-S column,
the same mobile phases, a flow rate of 500 μL/min, and detection
by absorption at 278 nm. The gradient program was a linear increase
from 0 to 60% B over 60 min. Only minor peptide impurities were detected
as small peaks eluting earlier than the main peak, barely above the
baseline noise. Method 1 or 2 suggested that the purity of synthetic
Aβ40 in the eluted fraction was &gt;92 or &gt;96%, respectively.

Seeded Fibril Formation
Fibril seeds were prepared
from rAβ40 by bath sonication of fibrils formed in a 30 μM
pH 7.4 buffer at 37 °C for at least 3 weeks. Synthetic Aβ40
was prepared as a 40 μM solution with 5% seeds and incubated
without agitation at 37 °C for at least 1 week. Synthetic Aβ40
was weighed to the nearest microgram on a Cahn microbalance, dissolved
in acidified HFIP, lyophilized, and reconstituted at a concentration
of 1–2 mM in 0.01% NH4OH. Our experience, based
on an infrared spectroscopic study, is that HFIP can be removed from
Aβ40 preparations much more easily than TFA, which was why Aβ40
peptides were washed in HFIP and HCl and extensively lyophilized before
use. This solution was diluted in incubation buffer containing fibril
seeds so that the final concentrations were 40 μM Aβ peptide
with 5% seeds. The mixture was incubated without agitation at 37 °C
for at least 1 week in polypropylene tubes. Prior to use, fibrils
were pelleted by centrifugation at &gt;10000g, washed,
and resuspended in measurement buffer [10 mM phosphate (pH 7.2)].
Fibril formation was confirmed for every fibril preparation by TEM.

LMW Aβ40
Synthetic Aβ40 was dissolved in
acidified HFIP and lyophilized overnight. Aliquots of the lyophilized
powder (100–200 μg) were dissolved in 5–10 μL
of 1% NH4OH, diluted to 30 μM in measurement buffer
at 4 °C, and kept on ice. Samples studied within 3 h of preparation
were deemed “LMW” Aβ40.

Chemical Cross-Linking
and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate–Polyacrylamide
Gel Electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) Analysis
Photoinduced
cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) was performed according
to published methods.29−31 In this application, 3 μL of 1 mM (Ru(byp)3)Cl2 and 3 μL of 20 mM APS in 10 mM sodium
phosphate (pH 7.4) were added to 54 μL of 30 μM freshly
prepared LMW Aβ40. The mixture was irradiated for 1 s using
a shuttered 150 W xenon lamp. The reaction was immediately quenched
with 10 μL of Tricine sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing
5% β-mercaptoethanol. Cross-linked mixtures were fractionated
without boiling by SDS–PAGE using 10–20% Tricine gels
(1.0 mm × 10 wells, Invitrogen) and silver stained using a Silver-Xpress
silver staining kit (Invitrogen). Bands were quantified by densitometry
using ImageJ.

HRF
X-ray exposures were performed
at beamline X-28C
of the National Synchrotron Light Source with beam currents ranging
between 183 and 195 mA using a modified KinTek quench flow apparatus
as previously described.32 Samples were
exposed for 0, 2.5 5, 10, 15, or 20 ms,33 immediately quenched with methionine amide (10 mM, final concentration)
to prevent secondary oxidation, and stored at −80 °C until
they were analyzed.34

Proteolysis
with Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Mass Spectrometry
(MS)
Irradiated fibrils were disrupted with tip sonication
(Fisher model 60) in 70% FA. The FA was then removed by three cycles
of rotary evaporation and washing with a 1:1 methanol/acetonitrile
mixture. Disrupted fibrils and LMW Aβ40 were digested with pepsin
at room temperature for 12 h at an enzyme:protein molar ratio of 1:20.
Digested Aβ40 was loaded onto a 300 μm (inside diameter)
× 2 cm C18 PepMap RP trapping column (Thermo Scientific) using
buffer A (100% water and 0.1% FA) at 10 μL/min to preconcentrate
the sample and wash away salts. Reverse phase separation was then
performed on a 75 μm (inside diameter) × 25 cm C18 PepMap
RSLC column with a 2 μm particle size, and 300 Å pore size,
using the nano UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation system (Dionex, Co.)
with buffer B (100% acetonitrile and 0.1% FA) increasing at 2% per
minute. The extent of oxidation for each amino acid residue was quantified
from MS1 spectra of the unmodified proteolytic peptides and their
radiolytic products using a Thermo Scientific LTQ FT Ultra mass spectrometer
equipped with a nanospray ion source and operating with a needle voltage
of 2.4 kV. All MS1 mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion
mode at a mass resolution of 100000. The identity of each peptic peptide
and specific sites of oxidation were determined using tandem MS and
specially optimized liquid chromatographic separation conditions that
yielded a base peak resolution of &gt;95%. Collision-induced dissociation
was found to be suitable, despite reports of better sequence coverage
using electron-transfer dissociation,35 which, in our hands, yielded only 35% coverage. Chromatographic
peaks were identified initially using Mascot (Matrix Science, Boston,
MA), but all were manually verified.

Calculation of Modification
Rates and Protection Factors
The integrated peak areas from
selected ion chromatograms of the
unmodified peptide (Au) and of a peptide
in which a residue is modified (Am) were
used to calculate the fraction unmodified: Fu = Au/(Au + Am). A graph of fraction unmodified
versus X-ray exposure time was fit to the equation Fu(t) = Fu(0)e–kt, where Fu(0) and Fu(t) are the fractions of unmodified peptide at time zero and time t, respectively, and k is a first-order
rate constant as detailed in recent reviews.36,37 Thus, modification rates are obtained from the slope of a logarithmic
graph, and each rate relies on multiple measurements. For fragments
containing Met residues, the modification rates were determined from
doubly modified fragments, because peaks for singly modified fragments
containing nonoxidized Met were not apparent. The fragments identified
and the amino acid side chains in each fragment for which rates were
determined are provided as Supporting Information (Tables S1–S3). Experimental protection factors were calculated
by dividing the modification rate for predigested Aβ40 peptides
(presumed to be mostly if not fully structure free) by the modification
rates for fibrillar and LMW Aβ40, thus normalizing the effects
of residue-specific reactivity to provide a pure measure of structure.
In addition, any errors in quantification due to variations in ionization
and detection efficiency of modified versus unmodified peptide species
cancel once protection factors are calculated. Therefore, protection
factors provide information that can be compared across experiments
and across residues to assess different structure models in an unbiased
manner.

Electron Microscopy
Peptide samples (∼20 ng)
in 1 μL of buffer were placed onto freshly glow-discharged carbon
films on 300 mesh nickel grids for 2 min and blotted with filter paper.
A 1% (w/v) solution of ammonium molybdate (Sigma-Aldrich) was adjusted
to pH 7.4 with ammonium hydroxide, applied for 2 min, blotted, and
air-dried. Images were recorded using a JEOL-1010 transmission electron
microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan), operating at 80 kV, equipped with
a side-mounted CCD digital camera. All fibril preparations used for
HRF studies were examined initially by TEM to verify fibril morphology.

Mass-per-Length Measurements
Approximately 10 ng of
seeded Aβ40 fibrils in 1 μL aliquots of buffer was applied
to carbon films on 300 mesh nickel grids and mixed with tobacco mosaic
virus (TMV) at 5.0 ng/μL. After 2 min, the grids were thoroughly
washed in distilled water, blotted, and air-dried. Dark-field TEM
images of unstained samples were obtained by shifting the objective
aperture, but otherwise using the same electron optics as in bright-field
imaging. The MPL of Aβ40 fibrils was determined using the method
of Chen et al. with modifications in the size of the integration area
as described in Results.38 The intensity in a rectangular area of a digital image
containing either Aβ40 fibril or TMV was integrated, and the
intensity of a nearby background area was subtracted. The MPL of the
Aβ40 fibril was determined by assuming a value of 131.4 kDa/nm
for the MPL of TMV and calculating the ratio of background-subtracted
signal intensities for Aβ40 fibrils and for TMV.39

Results
Overview of the Footprinting
Approach
Aβ40 fibrils,
LMW Aβ40, and pepsin-digested Aβ40 were exposed to a focused
X-ray beam for 0–20 ms to produce hydroxyl radicals from water
radiolysis that covalently modified solvent accessible and reactive
amino acid side chains. Carefully controlled and reproducible pepsin
digestions yielded 10 peptide fragments ranging in length from 5 to
14 residues with overlapping coverage of the entire Aβ40 sequence
(Figure 1). Fragments with and without modified
residues were chromatographically isolated, identified by tandem mass
spectrometry (Figure 1a), and quantified by
extraction of peak areas. Figure 1b shows a
representative example for the peptide spanning residues 10–19,
where retention time differences between peptides oxidized at different
locations (e.g., F19, L17, Y10, H13, and H14) allowed the identification
and quantification of oxidation products specific to individual residues
through retention time-specific extraction of discrete +16 kDa modified
species. Residue-specific modification rates were determined by integration
of peak areas and plotting those areas as a function of multiple exposure
times. Thus, for each structural state investigated, this approach
yielded 36 separately measured modification rates from the nested
set of pepsin fragments, spanning 16 different residues (Table 1; individual rates provided in Tables S1–S3
of the Supporting Information). Each rate
was derived from multiple measurements per peptide (from a peptide-specific
dose response) and from multiple peptides (when the particular oxidized
species was identified on more than one peptide).

Note that the vertical scale for modified Aβ10–19 (red
peaks) is 100-fold larger than that for unmodified Aβ10–19
(gray peak), so that the amount of modified polypeptide is a negligible
fraction of the amount of unmodified polypeptide.

Because it is difficult
to be certain that any preparation of Aβ40
is fully unstructured, modification rates were also measured for Aβ40
that had been digested with pepsin prior to irradiation to provide
a sample closely representing an unstructured state. The rates obtained
from predigested Aβ40 were divided by the rates obtained for
LMW and fibrillar Aβ40, which canceled the effects of side chain
reactivity and sequence context on modification rates. These calculations
yielded two sets of protection factors, one for LMW Aβ40 and
one for fibrillar Aβ40 (Table 1). Each
protection factor indicates the degree to which the solvent accessible
surface area of an amino acid side chain is reduced by protein folding
and aggregation.18,40,41

LMW Aβ40
PICUP and SDS–PAGE
The precise
physical state
of Aβ40 in solution is difficult to ascertain because of its
tendency to form polydisperse aggregates and because attempts to characterize
these aggregates can alter their populations. TEM suggested that freshly
prepared 30 μM solutions of Aβ40 at pH 7.4 contain many
oligomeric spherical aggregates (Figure S1a of the Supporting Information). However, TEM involves dehydration
and the application of high-ionic strength contrast agents, which
could artifactually induce aggregation. PICUP and subsequent SDS–PAGE
analysis indicated that LMW samples were approximately 16% dimeric
and 7% trimeric, with traces of higher-order species (Figure S1b of
the Supporting Information). However, the
cross-linking efficiency may be much less than 100%, so this technique
could underestimate the population of oligomeric species.

Protection
Factors
All seven residues in the N-terminal
portion of LMW Aβ40 (F4–F20) examined by HRF have protection
factors of 2, suggesting that the potential dimer and trimer structures
identified by cross-linking have modest but detectable interactions
in this region. Numerous NMR studies of Aβ monomers have suggested
that N-terminal residues may form α or 310 helices
(Figure S2 of the Supporting Information).42−49 Although most of these studies were performed in the presence of
helix-inducing solvents or detergents, an Aβ-binding antibody
is known to bind the five N-terminal residues in a helical conformation.50

Several residues in the C-terminal portion
of LMW Aβ40 (K28, I32, L34, V36, V39, and V40) have protection
factors ranging from 6 to 10. This suggests potential regions in which
the dimers and/or trimers may bind tightly or regions in which quaternary
interactions may dramatically alter tertiary structure. Fragments
containing modified forms of the three valine residues could not be
resolved chromatographically, so the rates listed in Table 1 are averages for all three residues. Aside from
V39, it is noteworthy that all of the highly protected C-terminal
side chains beyond V24 are even-numbered, while the less protected
residues (I31 and M35) are odd-numbered. This result is consistent
with β-sheet structure alternation in which even-numbered residues
are on one side of a β-sheet and more protected from solvent
while odd-numbered residues are on the other side and more exposed.
An exposed V24 residue is not present in any current monomer structure;
further, the high protection factors of C-terminal residues measured
in LMW Aβ40 are not consistent with any existing model. However,
the relatively high protection factor of 7 for K28 is consistent with
an amyloid folding nucleus for the Aβ40 monomer proposed by
Lazo et al.51

Fibrillar Aβ40
TEM
and MPL Analysis
Most fibrils exhibited semiregular
variations in width from ∼4 to ∼8 nm, suggesting a ribbonlike
structure (Figure 2a,b). Dark-field MPL determinations
using a 40 nm window for intensity integrations indicate that these
fibrils consist of a roughly even mixture of two and three filament
species with peaks in the histogram of MPL counts at 18.2 and 27.3
kDa/nm [average MPL of 25.2 kDa/nm (Figure 2c)]. To determine whether these results reflect a mixed population
of two-filament and three-filament fibrils, or variation in the number
of filaments along the length of each fibril, MPL determinations were
repeated on the same images using an 80 nm window. This analysis yielded
a similar average MPL (27.3 kDa/nm), but only one broad peak in the
histogram (Figure 2d). Because the same images
were used for both analyses, these results indicate that there is
variation in the number of filaments along the length of each fibril,
and they confirm previously published results.52

Protection Factors
In the N-terminal portion of fibrillar
Aβ40 from residue 11 to 24, the side chains of odd-numbered
residues have protection factors (30–80) much higher than those
of the side chains of even-numbered residues (4–20) (Table 1). This pattern is striking for adjacent pairs of
identical residues such as H13 and H14 (40 for H13 vs 20 for H14)
and F19 and F20 (80 for F19 vs 7 for F20). The opposite is found in
the C-terminal portion from residue 30 to 40 (excluding C-terminal
valines): odd-numbered residues have protection factors (6–20)
lower than those of even-numbered residues (60–90).

This
pattern is consistent with a fibril structure containing two apposing
β-sheets. To illustrate, measured protection factors have been
mapped onto a schematic representation of the core filament structure
common to both the two- and three-filament models (Figure 3, left).11 In addition
to positioning all of the relatively unprotected side chains (those
with protection factors from 4 to 20) on the periphery, this mapping
also illustrates that side chains of F19 (protection factor of 80)
and L34 (protection factor of 90) with nearly identical protection
factors are in the proximity of each other. Two residues assigned
to an unstructured “loop” region (V24 and K28) have
relatively high protection factors (20 and 60, respectively), despite
a lack of recognized regular secondary structure or order in this
region from SS-NMR. However, the high protection factor for K28 is
consistent with the SS-NMR detection of a salt bridge between K28
and D23 in Aβ40 samples incubated under conditions conducive
to the formation of homogeneous two-filament fibrils.53

Figure 3 Schematic representation (left) of one Aβ40 molecule from
the 2LMO model
showing the two β-sheets spanning residues 11–24 and
30–40 (angular black backbone segments) and two structurally
uncharacterized segments [residues 1–8 at the N-terminus and
residues 25–29 comprising a loop connecting the two sheets
(smooth gray backbone segments)]. Residues for which protection factors
were determined are color-coded according to the legend. Note that
all residues with protection factors of &lt;20 are on the outer surface
of this model. Cross section (right) of the 2LMO model with van der
Waals spheres for non-hydrogen atoms, illustrating a proposed quaternary
relationship between two filaments. The eight N-terminal residues
and residues 25–29 have been omitted from this model. The N-termini
are marked G9, and the C-termini are marked V40. Note that two residues
with low protection factors (I31, marked with number signs, and M35,
marked with asterisks) are buried in this model, while residues with
high protection factors (V39 and V40) are exposed.

Nevertheless, the two-filament assembly proposed
in 2LMO (Figure 3, right) is not consistent with all measured protection
factors. Specifically, residues I31 and M35 have protection factors
of only 20 and 6, respectively, despite being fully buried in the
model. However, the small protection factor for M35 is consistent
with the three-filament 2LMP model (Figure 4). Results for
Val 36 (protection factor of 400) and L34 (protection factor of 90)
are consistent with both models.

Figure 4 Cross sections of two different three-filament
fibril models with
van der Waals spheres for non-hydrogen atoms. Below each model is
a ball-and-stick rendering illustrating the backbone conformation
of one filament in the model. On the left is the 2LMP model with the three
Y10 residues at the N-termini labeled. Note that M35 (marked by an
asterisk in the lower filament) is exposed to the water-filled central
channel, consistent with the low observed protection factor. Also
note that residues F20 and I31 appear to be much more solvent accessible
than their adjacent residues of the same type (F19 and I32), consistent
with the observed protection factors. All other residues for which
data are available are either buried or accessible in this model,
consistent with the measured protection factors. At the right is the 2M4J model with its three
N-terminal “D1” residues marked. Note that the backbone
conformation does not correspond to a β-sheet, and there are
numerous discrepancies between expected and observed protection factors.
For example, F19 and F20 appear to be similarly buried, contrary to
the observed protection factors. Also, I31 is buried while I32 is
not, the converse of the relationship indicated by the observed protection
factors. M35 (marked by an asterisk in the lower filament) appears
to be less accessible than V40 in this model, again the converse of
the relationship indicated by the observed protection factors.

The three C-terminal valine residues
have high experimental protection
factors, although V40 is solvent-exposed in the 2LMO model. The high
protection factor for this residue may be due to the eight N-terminal
residues not included in the 2LMO model, or to quaternary contacts in the three-filament 2LMP and 2LMQ models, where L17
and H13 are in close contact with V36 and V39/40, respectively (Figure 4, left).12 It is important
to note that despite an inability to assign individual protection
factors to these three residues, the high protection factor assigned
collectively implies that all three are protected to some degree individually
(because any one of the residues, if unprotected, would dramatically
lower the overall protection factor). The high degree of protection
for these Val residues is in stark contrast to a much lower protection
factor for V24 (protection factor of 20), despite virtually identical
modification rates in unstructured fragments (Table 1). Therefore, these residues may be protected by N-terminal
contacts where fibrils have a two-filament structure, or by quaternary
contacts where the fibrils have a three-filament structure, given
that the MPL data described above suggest that these fibrils contain
a mixture of two- and three-filament segments.

Many protection
factors do not map well onto the three-filament 2M4J model (Figure 4).17 There are three
centers of inconsistency between the HRF results and this model in
which the C-terminal residues assume an irregular “cotter pin”
structure. One inconsistency is that many of the conformers comprising
the 2M4J model
place the F19 and F20 side chains adjacent to each other, with approximately
equal protection from solvent, while the HRF data show these residues
exhibit more than 10-fold variation in their protection factors (80
for F19 vs 7 for F20). A second inconsistency is that the model suggests
that V40 is less protected than M35, while the HRF data show that
V40 is more than 50-fold better protected than M35. Finally, the model
suggests that I32 is less protected than I31, whereas the HRF data
show 3-fold more protection for I32 than for I31.

Discussion
This study, using a combination of HRF and MPL analysis, unambiguously
supports an Aβ40 fibril structure composed of both the two-
and three-filament assemblies, and it is consistent with a combination
of the SS-NMR models 2LMN/O and 2LMP/Q (Figures 3 and 4). The feature common to both models
is a filament structure characterized by two β-sheets, with
odd-numbered side chains from the N-terminal sheet apposed to even-numbered
side chains from the C-terminal sheet. The models may be brought into
better agreement with the HRF data if residues 1–8 (omitted
in all the SS-NMR-derived structures) were positioned to protect residue
F4 and the C-terminal Val residues. The adoption of regular structure
in the loop spanning residues 25–29 would also improve agreement
by accounting for the observed protection of V24 and K28. The presence
of regular structure in this loop is also supported by limited proteolysis
and hydrogen exchange studies,54 as well
as by NMR evidence of a salt bridge between the side chains of D23
and K28 in the two-filament 2LMN/O models.51,55

Models other than 2LMN/O/P/Q are more difficult to reconcile
with
the HRF data. For example, the recently published 2M4J model also has three
filaments but is inconsistent with the high degree of protection we
observe in the C-terminal Val residues, and the lower level of protection
observed for M35. Also, the differences in protection observed in
adjacent residue pairs such as I31 and I32, and F19 and F20, are not
reflected in 2M4J (Figure 4, right). The models proposed by
Lührs et al.56 and Bertini et al.57 are also difficult to reconcile with the HRF
results. However, we note that that Lührs et al. were working
with Aβ42 and an oxidized M35 residue while Bertini et al. added
a Met residue to the N-terminus. Therefore, their samples are not
strictly comparable with those used for the study presented here.

Modest revisions of the filament structure and assembly in the
two- and three-filament models bring them into agreement with HRF
data provided that both forms are present in fibrils as indicated
by mass-per-length determinations (Figure 2). We have previously reported that Aβ40 fibrils exhibit “linear
heterogeneity”, and the results presented herein confirm this
remarkable aspect of fibril structure. In such circumstances, only
a modest overall level of protection is expected for residues such
as I31 and M35, despite the high degree of protection suggested in
the 2LMN/O structures, because they appear to be accessible in the
2LMP/Q structures.

MPL results indicating the presence of linear
heterogeneity, with
two- and three-filament regions intermixed, recall the cryo-EM results
of Sachse et al.,58 who reported an MPL
of ∼5 for a fibril that they described as being composed of
two double-helical “protofilaments”. They also reported
an MPL of 2.5 for a “filamentous substructure” of this
fibril. Such a result would arise naturally from fibrils in which
two- and three-filament regions alternate along the length of a fibril.
We have occasionally observed that fibrils grown at low pH exhibit
MPL peaks at three and six filaments per fibril. In these fibrils,
two strands are clearly apparent, and one strand occasionally ends
before the other (Figure 5). It is valuable
to contrast the morphology of fibrils formed at low pH with that of
fibrils grown at physiological pH (Figure 2) because it highlights the structural implications of linear heterogeneity
in the latter. At low pH, the MPL peaks at three and six filaments
per fibril are obtained irrespective of window size; they are readily
explained by intertwined three-filament fibrils, and this explanation
is supported by TEM results of Figure 5. At
physiological pH, however, we have not observed one strand ending
before the other by TEM. Instead, the appearance of an MPL peak at
both two and three filaments per fibril is resolved using a smaller
(40 nm) window in the analysis. Again, we emphasize that both HRF
and MPL studies independently lead to the conclusion that regions
with two and three filaments are present in individual fibrils.

Figure 5 TEM images
of Aβ40 fibrils formed at low pH (∼2) and
negatively stained with ammonium molybdate (pH 7.4) showing several
instances of fibrils that appear to be composed of two strands. In
each instance, the strands appear to twist around each other and one
terminates before the other. In each case, the strand that continues
has a morphology distinctly different from that of the portion with
two apparent strands. An MPL analysis of these fibrils exhibited peaks
at three and six filaments per fibril (data not shown). It should
be noted that the twist pitch of a fibril is sensitive to the type
and pH of the negative stain used, suggesting that prominent morphological
features observed in TEM images may be artifactual, perhaps due to
the high ionic strength of the stain adherent to the fibril that provides
contrast. MPL studies, in contrast, are performed on unstained specimens
that have been assiduously washed to remove salts.

Our LMW preparation resembles that of Zhang et
al.59 in that it consists of a mixed population
of dimers and
other small oligomers in rapid exchange with a monomeric peptide.
Our results for LMW Aβ40 are also similar to their HDX results
in suggesting that most residues in the N-terminal half of the peptide
are solvent accessible. However, their results for fibrillar Aβ40
also indicated a relatively high level of exchange for residues 35–40,
contrary to the high protection factors observed in this study. One
way to reconcile these differences is by noting that the fibrils of
Zhang et al. were formed in the presence of TFA, whereas we made a
vigorous effort to remove TFA before fibril formation. Another way
to reconcile the differences is to note that HDX data primarily reflect
the stability of the backbone secondary structure. It is possible
to have a region that can exchange with solvent in HDX while having
an ensemble average structure that is protected from hydroxyl radicals.
HDX exchange on a time scale of seconds to minutes can occur, while
the millisecond snapshot of the ensemble revealed by HDX shows significant
protection.60

The chief point of
our results for LMW Aβ40 is that sufficient
structure has formed to protect residues such as K28, I32, L34, V36,
V39, and V40 despite the LMW Aβ40 being freshly prepared at
4 °C after HFIP dissolution at a concentration of only 30 μM.
PICUP results point to the presence of small oligomers that may be
involved in this structure. One may speculate that K28 is protected
because of salt bridge formation, I32 and L34 are protected by virtue
of being on the other side of a β-sheet from I31 and M35, which
are not protected, and that V36, V39, and V40 are protected at the
center of a protein micelle that has been suggested to be an early
aggregated form.61

Given the known
polymorphism of fibrils generated under different
conditions, it is important to emphasize that the fibrils found in
AD are likely to have a high degree of thermodynamic stability because
they remain fibrillar while in exchange with nonfibrillar forms of
Aβ that are probably present at low nanomolar concentrations.
Presumably, the fibrils in AD have had a long time to anneal52 and adopt a stable structure while being incubated
at temperatures (e.g., 37 °C) that are significantly higher than
the room-temperature conditions commonly used when fibrils are formed
in the laboratory. Therefore, it is relevant that the fibrils described
herein were generated using seeds of known morphology at neutral pH
with relatively low total Aβ40 concentrations (30–40
μM). Fibrils formed in this manner have a self-propagating internal
structure and are remarkably stable (they appear to be in exchange
with &lt;100 nM nonfibrillar forms of Aβ40).16 In contrast, the thermodynamic stability of fibrils from
which the aforementioned models were derived is unknown.

Conclusions
HRF coupled with structural mass spectrometry has provided structural
data with single-amino acid resolution, in the form of solvent accessibility
protection factors, for 16 of the 40 residues in fibrillar and prefibrillar
Aβ40. The HRF-derived protection factors obtained in solution
are consistent with the core filament structure proposed by the 2LMP/Q
and 2LMN/O models, in which two β-sheets have odd-numbered side
chains from the N-terminal sheet apposed to even-numbered side chains
from the C-terminal sheet. Linear heterogeneity, such that regions
of two- and three-filament assemblies alternate along the length of
the fibril, is independently suggested by HRF and MPL techniques.
The ability to derive residue-specific solvent accessibility data
that might be used to complement structural constraints from SS-NMR
studies demonstrates that HRF with single-amino acid resolution may
be valuable for the analysis of other fibrillar and oligomeric forms
of Aβ40, especially when sample quantities are at a premium.
