GlgE (EC 2.4.99.16) is an α-maltose 1-phosphate:(1→4)-α-d-glucan 4-α-d-maltosyltransferase that is the
defining enzyme of a recently discovered biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. This four-step pathway generates α-glucan
from trehalose, whereby GlgE extends maltooligosaccharide
acceptors with disaccharide units from the donor α-maltose 1-phosphate.
Unusually, for a bacterial carbohydrate-active enzyme, GlgE is regulated
by phosphorylation. The GlgE pathway genes
are present in 14% of sequenced genomes of bacteria and archaea, making
it half as common as the classical glycogen α-glucan pathway
defined by GlgC and GlgA. One notable
bacterium that possesses the GlgE pathway genes is Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis that remains
a significant global health problem. GlgE
is itself a genetically validated anti-tuberculosis target with a
novel mode of action, and the first inhibitor
of GlgE has recently been reported. Thus,
understanding structure–function relationships of GlgE would
help in the development of inhibitors with therapeutic potential.

GlgE is the first member of CAZy (http://www.cazy.org)
glycoside hydrolase subfamily GH13_3, to be characterized.
Through comparison with other GH13 enzymes, GlgE is predicted to catalyze the transfer of maltosyl units with
a double-displacement reaction mechanism giving overall retention
of stereochemistry (Scheme ). Thus, the attack
of the donor substrate by a nucleophilic Asp residue is predicted
to generate a β-maltosyl-enzyme intermediate that is subsequently
liberated by an acceptor. An acid/base Glu residue is predicted to
assist by protonating the phosphate leaving group and then deprotonating
the incoming acceptor. Evidence in support of such a mechanism includes
the retention of the α anomeric configuration of α-maltose
1-phosphate after its transfer to the
nonreducing end of a maltooligosaccharide,
giving an α-1,4-glycosidic linkage. As expected, no activity
was detected with β-maltose 1-phosphate as the donor. In addition, the enzyme exhibited ping-pong kinetics,
consistent with the inability of GlgE to bind the intact donor and
acceptor simultaneously.

Proposed
α-Retaining Double-Displacement Mechanism of GlgE
This work presents evidence
of the structures shown at the top left and top right.

The structure of Streptomyces coelicolor GlgE
isoform I has been determined. Sequence
and structural alignments with other GH13 enzymes suggest the nucleophile and acid/base catalytic residues
of S. coelicolor GlgE isoform I are Asp394 and Glu423,
respectively. A maltose-bound structure is consistent with this interpretation.
However, attempts to obtain a structure with α-maltose 1-phosphate
bound have thus far been unsuccessful.

Evidence of the existence
of glycosyl-enzyme intermediates has
been obtained with a number of glycosyl-transferring enzymes by using
strategies to trap them kinetically. This has often involved the introduction
of electron-withdrawing substituents around the sugar ring to destabilize
the transition states of both catalytic steps, which are expected
to have oxocarbenium ion character. Such mechanism-based inhibitors
include 2-deoxy-2-fluoro,, 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro,
and 5-fluoro analogues. The disruption
of potential hydrogen bonding interactions by substitution of a hydroxyl
group with a fluorine further compromises these substrate analogues.
To accelerate the first step, these analogues are often employed as
their glycosyl fluorides, wherein the good fluoride leaving group
facilitates the formation of the intermediate. This strategy has been
used with great success with β-retaining enzymes, but there
are far fewer examples with α-retaining enzymes. Most examples
involve the use of 5-fluoro and 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro analogues and
the detection of intermediates using mass spectrometry (MS). There
are a limited number of examples of α-d-retaining and
related enzymes that have had their glycosyl-enzyme intermediate structurally
characterized: a GH13 family cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, a GH38 family α-mannosidase, a GH13 family amylosucrase, a GH31 family α-glycosidase, a GH13 family α-amylase, a GH27
α-galactosidase, a GH31 family
α-xylosidase, a GH31 family α(1→4)-glucan
disproportionating enzyme, and a GH31
α-(1,4)-glucan lyase. These were
trapped using either fluorinated substrate analogues, substrate analogues
that were unable to act as acceptors, or activated donor substrates
with an enzyme lacking its acid/base residue.

We now report
new evidence that supports the double-displacement
mechanism in the reaction catalyzed by GlgE (Scheme ). First, the crystal structure of the Michaelis complex between
the S. coelicolor enzyme and α-maltose 1-phosphate
was made possible by the substitution of the nucleophilic Asp394 with
Ala. Second, a covalent catalytic intermediate was trapped using a
2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl fluoride substrate analogue. This
was assisted by the substitution of the acid/base Glu423 residue of
the S. coelicolor enzyme with Ala. The resulting
maltosyl-enzyme intermediate was characterized by mass spectrometry
(MS) and X-ray crystallography. There are few examples of GH13 family
glycosyl-enzyme intermediate structures being determined, and this
is the first using a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro analogue. Such an intermediate
could also be identified by MS with the wild-type M. tuberculosis enzyme. Finally, high-resolution models of the S. coelicolor and M. tuberculosis enzymes were validated and
compared in solution using small-angle X-ray scattering, providing
the first glimpse of the structure of GlgE from a human pathogen.

Experimental
Procedures
2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl Fluoride
Thin layer
chromatography was performed on precoated silica plates (Merck 60
F254, 0.25 mm). Compounds were visualized by being heated after being
dipped in a solution of 5% (w/v) H2SO4 in ethanol.
Flash chromatography was performed on silica gel columns (Biotage
KP-Sil Silica, 60 Ǻ, 32–63 μm) fitted to
a Biotage (Uppsala, Sweden) SP1 automated purification system. 19F spectra were recorded at 376 MHz on a Bruker Avance III
400 MHz spectrometer (Bruker Biospin Ltd.). Data were analyzed using
a Topspin 2.1 software spectrometer (Bruker Biospin Ltd.), with J values in hertz.

3,6,2′,3′,4′,6′-Hexa-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-maltosyl fluoride
was prepared according to a published procedure with modifications (Scheme S1 of the ). Boron trifluoride etherate (42 μL,
0.36 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of maltal per-O-acetate (0.5 g, 0.9 mmol) and XeF2 (0.17 g, 1 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (10 mL) at −70
°C. The reaction mixture was gradually allowed to warm to 0 °C,
stirred at 0 °C for 2.5 h, and diluted with dichloromethane (50
mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate
(50 mL) and water (50 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered,
and evaporated to yield the crude product (0.5 g) as an amorphous
solid. Thin layer chromatography [1:2 (v/v) ethyl acetate:n-hexane] showed the presence of two products; the slower-running
α isomer (Rf =
0.4) was purified by flash chromatography using an isocratic elution
[1:2 (v/v) ethyl acetate:n-hexane] to give a syrup
(100 mg, 21%): 19F NMR (CDCl3) δ −150.7
(d, JF1,F2 19.1, F-1), −205.0 (d, JF2,F1 19.1, F-2). 3,6,2′,3′,4′,6′-Hexa-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-d-maltosyl fluoride
was deacetylated using catalytic sodium methoxide according to published
methods. The deprotected product was
purified by flash chromatography using an isocratic elution [4:1 (v/v)
ethyl acetate:methanol], yielding a colorless syrup.

Site-Directed
Mutagenesis
Muteins were generated using
a QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies).
Conserved catalytic residues Asp394 and Glu423 were substituted with
alanine residues to abolish their functions. The forward primers for
mutating Asp394 and E423 were 5′-GCGCATCTTCCGCGTCGCCAACCCCCACACCAAAC-3′
and 5′-CTTCCTGGCCGCGGCCTTCACCCG-3′
(mutated bases underlined), respectively. Mutations within expression
plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Expression and Purification
of GlgE Proteins
Expression
and purification of S. coelicolor GlgE isoform I
and M. tuberculosis GlgE were conducted as previously
reported.,

Structure Determination and Refinement
Crystals of
the two S. coelicolor GlgE muteins were obtained
as previously described and soaked in
a crystallization solution [15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.2
M sodium citrate, and 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol] containing ligand
prior to mounting. The α-maltose 1-phosphate complex of the D394A mutein was obtained by soaking a protein
crystal for 1 h in a 5 mM solution of the ligand. The 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride-derived complex of the E423A mutein was obtained by soaking
a protein crystal for 210 s in a 5 mM solution of the ligand, and
as a control, a similar crystal was soaked in 5 mM maltose for 180
s.

Crystals were flash-cooled in LithoLoops (Molecular Dimensions)
by being plunged into liquid nitrogen and stored in Unipuck cassettes
(MiTeGen) prior to being transported to the synchrotron. The crystals
were subsequently transferred robotically to the goniostat on station
I24 or I04-1 at the Diamond Light Source (Oxfordshire, U.K.) and maintained
at 100 K with a Cryojet cryocooler (Oxford Instruments). Diffraction
data were recorded using either a Pilatus 6M or 2M detector (Dectris).
The resultant images were processed using the XIA2 expert system. X-ray data collection statistics are summarized
in Table .

Rmerge = ∑hkl∑i|Ii(hkl) – ⟨I(hkl)⟩|/∑hkl∑iIi(hkl).

Rmeas = ∑hkl[N/(N – 1)]1/2 × ∑i|Ii(hkl) – ⟨I(hkl)⟩|/∑hkl∑iIi(hkl), where Ii(hkl) is
the ith observation of
reflection hkl, ⟨I(hkl)⟩ is the weighted average intensity for all observations i of reflection hkl, and N is the number of observations of reflection hkl.

CC1/2 is the
correlation
coefficient between intensities taken from random halves of the data
set.

The data set was split
into “working”
and “free” sets consisting of 95 and 5% of the data,
respectively. The free set was not used for refinement.

Rwork and Rfree were calculated as follows: R = ∑(|Fobs – Fcalc|)/∑|Fobs| ×
100, where Fobs and Fcalc are the observed and calculated structure
factor amplitudes, respectively.

As calculated using MolProbity.

The data sets were processed in
space group P41212 with approximate
cell parameters of a = b = 113 Å
and c = 314 Å and, in contrast to the majority
of previous data sets, did not suffer
from severe twinning. The structures
were determined by molecular replacement using one subunit from the
apo-GlgE structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3ZSS] as input to PHASER. In all cases, this was successful in placing
two copies of the subunit in the asymmetric unit. Despite the apparent
isomorphism with the only untwinned data set from the previous study
[i.e., the complex with α-cyclodextrin (PDB entry 3ZST)], the resultant asymmetric unit corresponded to the biological
dimer for all structures, rather than to halves of two separate biological
dimers as seen previously. In each case, electron density maps, inspected
using COOT, were consistent with the
expected point mutations and provided clear evidence of ligand binding
at the donor pocket. The structures were rebuilt and completed through
several iterations of refinement (with local noncrystallographic symmetry
restraints) in REFMAC5, and manual adjustment
in COOT. In the latter stages, translation libration screw refinement
was used with a total of eight translation libration screw domains,
which were defined using the translation libration screw motion determination
server (http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/∼tlsmd/). Refinement statistics are summarized
in Table . All structural figures were prepared
using CCP4MG.

Enzymatic Assay
Unless otherwise specified, all enzyme
assays were performed at 21 °C using an end-point assay involving
the detection of inorganic phosphate with malachite green. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Reaction mixtures (25 μL) consisted of 100 mM Bis-Tris propane
(pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM maltohexaose, and 0.25 mM α-maltose
1-phosphate. Reactions were initiated
by the addition of α-maltose 1-phosphate and mixtures assayed
for 10 min before reactions were quenched with 175 μL of malachite
green reagent [0.011% (w/v) in 1 M HCl containing 1% (w/v) ammonium
molybdate and 0.037% (v/v) Triton N101], followed by incubation for 20 min at 21 °C. The absorbance
at 630 nm was measured on a SpectraMax Plus microplate spectrophotometer
using SoftMax Pro version 3.1.1. Initial reaction rates for S. coelicolor GlgE E423A were determined using 28 μM
protein with assay mixtures terminated over the first 12 min. The
activity of S. coelicolor GlgE D394A was measured
at protein concentrations between 0.75 and 9.6 μM. Inhibition
of S. coelicolor GlgE E423A by 1 mM 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride was tested by preincubation of 28 μM GlgE E423A for
5–60 min. The reaction of wild-type S. coelicolor GlgE with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl fluoride as a donor
was monitored by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Reaction mixtures (20
μL) comprising 1 mM maltotetraose, 5 mM 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride, and 18 μM protein were incubated for 20 min at 21
°C before being analyzed.

MALDI-TOF,
Orbitrap, and LC–MS
2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride (2 mM) was added to either 100 μM wild-type or E423A S. coelicolor GlgE or wild-type M. tuberculosis GlgE in 20 mM Bis-Tris propane (pH 7.0) or 20 mM Tris (pH 8.5),
respectively, and incubated for at least 5 min at 21 °C. An aliquot
(1 μL, approximately 100 pmol) was diluted in 50 μL of
40 mM HCl. One microgram of pepsin (porcine, Princeton Separations,
Adelphia, NJ) was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C
for 16 h. An aliquot (approximately 1 pmol) was diluted into 20 μL
of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a nanoAcquity (Waters,
Manchester, U.K.) UPLC system running at a flow rate of 250 nL/min
connected to an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
MA). Peptides were trapped using a precolumn (Symmetry, C18, 5 μm,
180 μm × 20 mm, Waters), which was then switched in line
to an analytical column (BEH, C18, 1.7 μm, 75 μm ×
250 mm, Waters) for separation. Peptides were eluted with a gradient
of 3 to 40% acetonitrile in water, containing 0.1% formic acid, at
a rate of 0.67%/min. The m/z (e.g.,
853.9 with a z of +2) of the expected modified peptide
was used on an inclusion list for the detection by the mass spectrometer.

Raw files were processed with MaxQuant version 1.3.0.5 (http://maxquant.org) to generate
recalibrated peaklist files that were used for a database search using
an in-house Mascot 2.4 Server (Matrix Science Limited, London, U.K.).
Mascot searches were performed on the Uniprot sptrembl20121031 database
with taxonomy set to S. coelicolor, a 6 ppm precursor
tolerance, a 0.6 Da fragment tolerance, zero missed cleavages, and
a mass of 326.1 as a variable modification. Mascot search results
were imported and evaluated in Scaffold version 4.0.4 (proteomsoftware.com,
Portland, OR). Additional LTQ-Orbitrap methods are described in the . The pepsin-digested sample
was analyzed with an Ultraflex MALDI-TOF/TOF (Bruker, Coventry, U.K.).
It was spotted onto a Prespotted AnchorChip (PAC) MALDI target plate
(Bruker) and analyzed using methods optimized for peptides and for
fragmentation using LIFT technology. The acquired spectra were processed
in FlexAnalysis (Bruker).

The intact mass analysis was performed
using LC–MS on a
Synapt G2 HDMS mass spectrometer coupled to an Acquity UPLC system
(Waters). The protein (around 200 pmol) was loaded onto a C4 reversed
phase column (BEH300, C4, 1.7 μm, 1 mm × 50 mm, Waters)
and eluted with a gradient from 10 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic
acid (v/v) in 13 min. The mass spectrometer was run in MS/sensitivity/positive
mode with standard settings. Spectra under the LC peak were combined
and deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 tool in MassLynx version 4.1 (Waters).

SAXS Data Collection
S. coelicolor and M. tuberculosis GlgE proteins were analyzed
at several protein concentrations each in ranges of 0.6–11.0
and 0.5–7.9 mg/mL, respectively. The synchrotron radiation
X-ray scattering data were collected on beamline X33 of the EMBL Hamburg
on storage ring DORIS III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) using a PILATUS 1M pixel array detector, a sample–detector
distance of 2.7 m, and a wavelength (λ) of 1.5 Å. The range
of momentum transfer (s) from 0.01 to 0.5 Å–1 was covered (s = 4π sin θ/λ,
where 2θ is the scattering angle). To monitor the radiation
damage, eight successive 15 s exposures of protein solutions were
compared, and no significant changes were observed. The data were
normalized to the intensity of the transmitted beam and radially averaged;
the scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves
were scaled for protein concentration. The low-angle data measured
at lower protein concentrations were extrapolated to infinite dilution
and merged with the higher-concentration data to yield the final composite
scattering curves. PRIMUS was used for
data processing.

Determination of the Radius
of Gyration and Molecular Mass by
SAXS
The forward scattering [I(0)] and the
radius of gyration (Rg) were evaluated
using the Guinier approximation assuming
that at very small angles (s &lt; 1.3/Rg) the intensity is represented as I(s) = I(0) exp[−(sRg)2/3]. The radii of gyration were also computed
from the entire scattering patterns using the indirect transform package
GNOM. The Fourier transform of the scattering
profile also provides the pair distribution function of the particle
[p(r)] and the maximal size (Dmax). The molecular mass of the solute was evaluated
by comparison of the forward scattering with that of the reference
solution of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). The excluded volume of
the hydrated particle was computed from the small-angle portion of
the data (s &lt; 0.25 Å–1)
using the Porod invariant. For globular
proteins, Porod volumes in cubic nanometers are ∼1.7 times
the molecular masses in kilodaltons.

Molecular Modeling Using SAXS Data
Theoretical scattering
profiles of the crystallographic and predicted models of GlgE were
calculated with CRYSOL. Given the atomic
coordinates, the program minimizes the discrepancy in the fit to the
experimental intensity by adjusting the excluded volume of the particle
and the contrast of the hydration layer. The discrepancy (χ2) between the measured and calculated SAXS profiles is defined
aswhere N is the number of
experimental points, c is a scaling factor, Icalc(sj) and Iexp(sj) are the calculated and experimental scattering
intensities, respectively, and σ(sj) is the experimental error at momentum transfer sj.

The crystallographic
and homology models of dimeric proteins were refined by a brute force
global search program GENCRY developed in house. The program rotates
and moves the monomer, constructs the dimer using a P2 symmetry axis, and calculates the fit by CRYSOL. With the initial
model as a starting point, monomers were displaced up to ±0.2
nm along each axis with an increment of 0.1 nm and rotated around
the center of mass by Euler angles α, γ (±0.1 rad),
and 0 rad &lt; β &lt; 0.2 rad with an increment of 0.05 rad.
CRYSOL fits from the 15625 resulting models to the experimental SAXS
data were ranked based on the χ2 value to select
the best fitting model.

Results
Binding of α-Maltose
1-Phosphate to GlgE
We have
previously reported structures of S. coelicolor GlgE
isoform I (PDB entry 3ZSS in Figure  and Figure S1A of the ), including those with
α-maltose bound (PDB entry 3ZT5 in Figure S1B of the ). The
putative nucleophile (Asp394) and general acid/base (Glu423) catalytic
residues were close to the reducing end of the maltose, suggesting
the glucose rings occupied subsites −1 and −2 of the donor substrate, α-maltose 1-phosphate.
However, it was not possible to obtain a structure of GlgE with the
donor bound, presumably because it was slowly but excessively hydrolyzed
over the time scale of protein crystallization.

Domains within a dimer
of S. coelicolor GlgE isoform
I (PDB entry 3ZSS).

To determine a structure with the intact donor substrate
bound,
the predicted nucleophilic residue, Asp394, was mutated to Ala. The
maltosyl transferase activity of the D394A mutein was &gt;4 orders
of
magnitude lower than that of the wild-type protein as expected. A
crystal of the D394A mutein was soaked in 5 mM α-maltose 1-phosphate,
and a ligand-bound structure was successfully determined to 2.55 Ǻ
resolution (PDB entry 4CN1 in Figure A and Figure S1C
of the ). The ability
to observe the intact substrate was consistent with a significantly
weaker ability of the mutein to catalyze its hydrolytic side reaction
as expected. The substitution of Asp394 with Ala was confirmed in
the electron density map, but no other significant differences in
the protein structure were observed (Figures S1 and S2 of the ). The interactions between
the protein and the sugar rings were very similar to those observed
in the maltose-bound structures, and
the overall conformations of the sugar rings were likewise similar
(Figure ). This supports the assignment of
subsites −2 and −1 and is consistent with the structures
of other GH13 enzymes. Therefore, the
phosphate group of α-maltose 1-phosphate was located in what
was predicted to be subsite +1. This
group made hydrogen bonding interactions with the side chains of Asn352
and Tyr357 from domain B and Asn395 and Glu423 from domain A, as previously
predicted (Figure A and Figures S1C and S2B of the ). The carboxyl group of Glu423 formed an ∼3.0 Å hydrogen
bond to one of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group and was only
∼3.7 Å from the phosphate ester oxygen atom. The proximity
of this conserved amino acid to the phosphate group is consistent
with it being the general acid/base catalytic residue that protonates
the leaving group. The side chain of Glu423 also interacted with the
backbone NH group of Asn395, which could have a role in defining its
pKa, a possibility that would require
further investigation. Interestingly, the phosphate does not sit in
the “tucked under” conformation seen for GT35 phosphorylases
such as glycogen phosphorylase as well as many nucleotide sugar-dependent
GTs., This difference likely reflects the quite
different mechanisms followed: double-SN2 displacement
versus internal nucleophilic substitution SNi. While it is tempting to speculate
further about the existence and role of each hydrogen bonding interaction
observed in this ligand-bound structure with a mutated enzyme, the
hydrogen bonding network may be a little different in the true Michaelis
complex.

Structures of GlgE with (A) α-maltose 1-phosphate bound to
the D394A mutein (PDB entry 4CN1) and (B) the covalent intermediate formed between
the E423A mutein and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl fluoride (PDB
entry 4CN4).
Difference electron density “omit” maps were generated
for bound ligands using phases from final models without ligand coordinates
after application of small random shifts to the models and re-refining.
The corresponding stereo images are shown in Figure S1 of the . Some amino acids interacting
with the ligands have been omitted for the sake of clarity, but all
are shown in Figure S2 of the . Subsites −1 and −2 are labeled.

Superposed structures of (A) maltose (PDB entry 3ZT5, gray) and α-maltose
1-phosphate (PDB entry 4CN1, green) bound to wild-type and D394A GlgE, respectively,
and (B) maltose (PDB entry 4CN6, blue) and the trapped 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-maltosyl
intermediate (PDB entry 4CN4, yellow) bound to the E423A mutein. Comparison of
the structures in panel B reveals that the anomeric carbon moves 1.6
Ǻ to allow the formation of a covalent bond between the
disaccharide and D394. The glucose rings in each structure adopt the
low-energy 4C1 conformation.

A Covalent Maltosyl-GlgE
Intermediate
To capture a
maltosyl-GlgE intermediate for structural studies, a donor substrate
analogue was used together with a mutated form of GlgE. 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride was first synthesized (Scheme S1 of the ) as an analogue for which both chemical
steps (formation and hydrolysis of the intermediate) should be slow
because of the destabilization of the oxocarbenium ion-like transition
states by the fluorine at position 2., The further
presence of the good anomeric fluoride leaving group should reaccelerate
the first step, making the intermediate kinetically accessible (Scheme ). Thus, the 2-fluoromaltosyl-enzyme intermediate
would be expected to be much longer-lived than that formed during
normal turnover.

The activity of the wild-type enzyme with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride was tested using maltotetraose as an acceptor. MS analysis
of the product mixture clearly showed the successive extension of
the acceptor by 326 Da consistent with the addition of 2-deoxy-2-fluoromaltosyl
groups (Figure S3 of the ). 2-Deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl fluoride inhibited turnover
of the normal substrate: after preincubation for 5 min with 1 mM analogue,
70% of the normal activity with α-maltose 1-phosphate was lost,
and longer preincubations did not result in any further loss of activity
(Figure S4 of the ). The residual 30% activity was therefore consistent with the analogue
being a slow substrate rather than a dead-end inhibitor.

The presence of any covalent modification
of GlgE with the substrate
analogue was assessed using MS of the intact wild-type protein. Incubation
of the protein with the substrate analogue led to an increase in the
mass of 326.4 Da (from 77496.5 to 77822.9 Da with a predicted change
of 326.3 Da) for a small proportion of the protein, consistent with
the modification of some of the GlgE with a 2-deoxy-2-fluoromaltosyl
group.

To slow the turnover of the 2-fluoromaltosyl intermediate
further,
a mutation was introduced into GlgE. Having already obtained evidence
for Glu423 being the general acid/base, we mutated this residue to
Ala, giving an E423A mutein. This mutation would have little effect
on the formation of the intermediate from a glycosyl fluoride for
the reasons described above. However, the absence of this residue
and its associated general base catalytic role would lower the rate
of the intermediate’s decay. Indeed, the E423A mutein turned
over the normal substrate, α-maltose 1-phosphate, ∼500
times slower than did the wild-type enzyme.

The modification
of the E423A mutein with the substrate analogue
was assessed using MS. An essentially quantitative increase in mass
of 326.3 Da was observed (Figure S5 of the ), consistent with the modification of the entire
sample. The mass of the modified protein reverted fully to that of
the unmodified protein after 24 h at 4 °C, showing that it was
ultimately sensitive to hydrolysis given sufficient time. The location
of the modification along the polypeptide chain was then determined
using pepsin digestion at low pH, which would assist in preserving
the integrity of the ester linkage of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediates,
followed by MS. Only 19% sequence coverage was obtained, presumably
reflecting the poor sequence specificity of pepsin. Nevertheless,
a modification within a peptide fragment consistent with 392RVDNPHTKPVAF403 was identified, which gave a loss of 326.17 Da after LIFT
fragmentation to give the expected unmodified peptide mass of 1380.83
Da (Figure S6 of the ). Peptide sequencing using Orbitrap MS/MS analysis of b- and y-ion
series from the modified peptide identified the Asp residue within 392RVDNPHTKPVAF403 as the site of modification (Table ). This was consistent with Asp394 being the catalytic nucleophile
as predicted.

with an observed mass change within the b-ion series of 441.13 Da
in both cases that was consistent with the predicted value (115.03
Da for the Asp plus 326.10 Da for the 2-deoxy-2-fluoromaltosyl group,
giving 441.16 Da).

The structural
integrity of the E423A mutein was then confirmed
by determining its structure to 2.3 Ǻ resolution after
soaking a crystal with maltose (PDB entry 4CN6 in Table  and
Figure S1D of the ). The mutation of Glu423 to Ala was confirmed, and the presence
of the β anomer rather than the α anomer of maltose was
observed. It would therefore appear that the loss of the Glu423 side
chain in this mutein allowed the energetically more favorable β
anomer to be accommodated within its active site. Apart from these
minor differences, the structure of the mutein resembled that of the
wild-type protein.

Finally, a crystal
of the E423A mutein was soaked with 5 mM 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl
fluoride and flash-frozen after 210 s. Its structure was determined
to 2.4 Ǻ resolution (PDB entry 4CN4 in Table , Figure B, and Figure S1E of the ). There were no significant changes in the overall
protein structure compared with that of the maltose-bound form, but
there was clear continuous electron density consistent with Asp394
being modified with a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-maltosyl group. In
the process of forming the covalent bond, the reducing end sugar was
tilted within subsite −1 toward the Asp394 residue such that
its anomeric carbon moved 1.6 Å compared with that in the corresponding
maltose-bound structure (Figure ). By contrast,
the nonreducing end glucose ring within subsite −2 took up
a position similar to those of all other structures with this subsite
occupied. Indeed, the nonreducing end sugar ring was consistently
associated with better resolved electron density and lower B factors (although this was less pronounced for the maltose-bound
form of the E423A mutein). The hydrogen bonding interactions between
the protein and the sugar rings were broadly similar to those of other
structures. Small differences included an additional interaction between
Arg392 and the C1 oxygen of the newly formed covalent bond (Figure B and Figures S1E and S2C of the ).

Relevance of the S. coelicolor GlgE to M. tuberculosis GlgE
The enzymes from S.
coelicolor and M. tuberculosis have a lot
in common; they have 51% identical sequences with essentially complete
conservation within the donor site, share similar net secondary structures
according to circular dichroism spectroscopy, and have very similar
kinetic properties, including indistinguishable Km values for α-maltose 1-phosphate., To further explore their commonalities, the M. tuberculosis enzyme was exposed to 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-maltosyl fluoride.
MALDI-TOF MS identified an increase in mass of the intact protein
of 324 Da, from 80316 Da (80316 Da, expected) to 80640 Da, consistent
with formation of a covalent intermediate despite it being the wild-type
protein rather than an active site mutein. Pepsin digestion and Orbitrap
MS/MS analysis gave 44% sequence coverage and identified 415FRVDNPHTKPPNF427 as a modified peptide with D418 forming the covalent glycosidic
linkage (Table ). This Asp residue was indeed
predicted to be the nucleophilic residue based on sequence alignments.

Although we are developing a good understanding
of the structure of the S. coelicolor enzyme, a high-resolution
structure of M. tuberculosis GlgE has proven to be
elusive. It was already known that both enzymes formed dimers in solution
according to analytical ultracentrifugation., To
explore their structural similarities further, they were both subjected
to SAXS analysis at several protein concentrations (Figure A and Figure S7 and Table S1 of the ). The proteins had similar
radii of gyration (Rg = 40 ± 1 Å)
consistent with dimeric assemblies as expected. Further, the maximal
sizes of the particles (Dmax) derived
from the p(r) function analysis
(Figure S7 of the ) were in good agreement with the maximal distance between surface
amino acids of ∼130 Å observed in the crystallographic
homodimer of S. coelicolor GlgE.

Despite the
similar radii of gyration and homodimeric states of
both proteins in solution, the SAXS patterns displayed noticeable
differences in the momentum transfer range from 0.1 to 0.2 Å–1, i.e., in the resolution range from 60 to 30 Å,
corresponding to quaternary structure (Figure A and Figure S7 of the ). The difference in the overall structure was further corroborated
by a shift of the main maximum of the M. tuberculosis GlgE pair distribution function p(r) compared to that of S. coelicolor GlgE (Figure
S7 of the ).

The theoretical scattering profile of the crystal structure of
the S. coelicolor GlgE dimer computed by CRYSOL agreed
well with the experimental data recorded, with a discrepancy χ
of 1.03 (Figure A), indicating that the homodimer
observed in the crystal structure is probably preserved in solution.
The S. coelicolor GlgE model gave a poorer fit to
the experimental scattering from M. tuberculosis GlgE
with a χ of 1.34. To verify whether the misfit was caused by
the difference in species, a homology model of the dimeric M. tuberculosis GlgE was generated using the SWISSMODEL
server, with the crystal structure of S. coelicolor GlgE serving as a structural template. The
homology model still yielded a poor fit to the data from M.
tuberculosis GlgE with a χ of 1.38, and most of the
systematic deviations in the fit remained in the range of 0.1–0.2
Å–1 (Figure A). This
observation indicated that the most likely cause of the misfit was
differences in the orientation of the two monomers in the dimeric
assemblies of the two enzymes.

data and fit for the S. coelicolor GlgE protein (χ

fit of the theoretical profile of the initial homology model based
on the S. coelicolor GlgE crystal structure (χ

after the GENCRY rigid body refinement giving a significantly better
fit particularly in the range of 0.1–0.2 Å–1 (χ = 1.09; theoretical fit colored red), consistent with a
better relative orientation of the monomers. The SAXS profiles are
displaced along the logarithmic axis for the sake of clarity. The
homology model of the M. tuberculosis GlgE dimer
(B) based on the S. coelicolor GlgE structure before
(yellow) and after (red) rigid body refinement gave a root-mean-square
deviation of 6.8 Å. The overall orientation of the dimer is similar
to that in Figure .

To refine the M. tuberculosis dimer model,
an
exhaustive rigid body search in which one monomer of the M.
tuberculosis homology model was rotated and moved around
its position within the context of a dimeric assembly was employed.
The best fitting model with a χ of 1.09 yielded a good fit to
the experimental data (Figure A). The refined
model had a root-mean-square deviation of 6.8 Å from the original
homology model of M. tuberculosis GlgE (Figure B).

Discussion
The structure of the
GlgE D394A mutein with α-maltose 1-phosphate
bound provides supporting evidence for the assignment of subsites
−2, −1, and +1. Although there are no significant changes
to the structure of the protein once this donor substrate has bound
to the enzyme, it is likely that domain B acts like a lid to allow
entry and exit to the otherwise enclosed donor site. Subsite +1 is
expected to be able to bind the nonreducing sugar ring of an acceptor
molecule once the phosphate group has departed, but no structures
with wild-type or mutated proteins in which this is the case have
thus far been determined. It is likely that other more distant subsites,
such as those responsible for binding cyclodextrins near the donor
site, are primarily responsible for the
affinity of the enzyme for acceptor substrates. This is supported
by the shortest acceptor being maltotetraose.,

The trapping of a maltosyl-Asp394 intermediate unequivocally confirms
the identity of the nucleophile. In addition, superposition of all
three structures presently described shows that the oxygen atom of
Asp394 that forms the glycosyl intermediate is aligned along the trajectory
of the C1–O bond of α-maltose 1-phosphate and is ∼3.5
Å from C1 (Figure A). This arrangement
is consistent with the first step of the proposed mechanism (Scheme ). The proximity of the Glu423 carboxyl group to
the phosphate group of the donor substrate (Figure A and Figure S1C of the ), together with the slowing of GlgE activity in the D423A mutein,
supports the role of this amino acid as the acid/base catalytic residue.
Importantly, this evidence strongly supports the proposed double-displacement
mechanism (Scheme ).

The structure of
the maltosyl-enzyme intermediate shows few changes
in the protein compared with the corresponding maltose-bound structures,
except for of course the presence of electron density consistent with
the formation of a covalent bond between the substrate and the enzyme.
For this bond to form, the Asp394 nucleophilic side chain did not
move significantly, but the reducing end sugar ring of the donor molecule
in subsite −1 tilted toward it, giving an ∼1.6 Å
shift in the position of C1. Similar ∼1 Å movements in
C1 of the sugar ring have been observed in other enzymes such as a
α-retaining GH13 family cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase.

The ability of the sugar ring to tilt
in subsite −1 is potentially
relevant to the conformational requirements of an α-retaining
mechanism. The low-energy 4C1 conformation is appropriate for the loss of the axial phosphate
group for stereoelectronic reasons. Such
a conformation is indeed observed in the crystal structure with the
donor substrate bound (Figure A and Figure
S1C of the ). It
is expected that the first transition state with oxocarbenium character
would adopt a 4H3 half-chair
conformation (Scheme ). It has been argued
that a glucosyl-enzyme intermediate in an α-retaining enzyme
that catalyzes transglycosylation reactions would adopt a 4C1 conformation to prolong its lifetime,
thus allowing the catalytic cycle to be completed before any hydrolytic
side reaction could take place. Such
a low-energy conformation of the intermediate is observed with GlgE
(Figure B and Figure S1E of the ). Indeed, the C2–C1–O5–C5
torsion angle of this sugar ring is within 9° of the angle of
−65° observed in crystalline α-maltose in all of the reported ligand-bound structures
of GlgE. However, for this conformation to be adopted without moving
the Asp394 side chain, the sugar ring had to tilt instead. The deglycosylation
step would be expected to involve a 1S3 skew boat conformation, allowing the glucose–Asp394
bond to adopt a pseudoaxial position. This is feasible without moving
the Asp394 side chain because all of the ring except for C1 could
tilt back toward its original position (Scheme ). To minimize the chance of hydrolysis, it is tempting to speculate
that such a conformation is adopted only when the acceptor is also
bound. The second transition state, analogous to the first, would
then lead to the formation of the product.

GlgE is efficient
in catalyzing reversible phosphorolysis and transglycosidation
reactions with little observable hydrolytic activity., The suppression of hydrolytic reactions could be due in part to
the binding of the acceptor affecting the conformation of the intermediate,
as discussed above. In addition, inspection of the electron density
near the intermediate revealed the presence of water molecules within
the active site hydrogen-bonded to the 2′-OH group of the maltosyl
group and Tyr357 (Figure ). Importantly, none
of these water molecules were positioned appropriately to attack C1
of the intermediate, with the closest water molecule being 5.0 Å
away, and at an angle of ∼30° to the expected trajectory.
This water molecule would have to move for the structure to accommodate
an appropriately positioned water molecule for nucleophilic attack.
Therefore, the structure is consistent with the possibility of GlgE
utilizing this strategy to avoid hydrolysis, as has been suggested
for other enzymes such as a GH31 family α-transglucosylase.

The structures of only three glycosyl-enzyme
intermediates in the
GH13 family have been determined previously using either 5-fluoro
substrate analogues, substrate analogues that were unable to act as
acceptors, or activated donor substrates with an enzyme lacking its
acid/base residue.,, GlgE is the first example of a GH13 family enzyme to have its intermediate
structurally characterized using a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro analogue, showing
that it is not necessary to use the synthetically more challenging
5-fluoro or 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro strategies in this case. Although
it was necessary to introduce a mutation into GlgE to give the intermediate
sufficient longevity to allow its crystal structure to be determined,
the intermediate could also be observed with wild-type proteins by
MS. The lack of success in such trapping with α-glycosidases
previously has been suggested to be due to less development of positive
charge at the neighboring C1 in the transition states of these α-retaining
enzymes than in β-retaining enzymes. This could be due in part to the alignment of the oxygen atom of
the Asp carboxyl near the oxygen atom of the sugar ring in GH13 family
enzymes. However, this alignment was
also observed in the intermediate of GlgE (Figure B and Figure S1E of the ). Thus, it remains unclear why the strategy worked better with GlgE
than with other GH13 family enzymes.

GlgE is an interesting
enzyme in its own right, given that it is
the defining enzyme of the GH13_3 subfamily and a recently discovered
bacterial α-glucan biosynthetic pathway. However, its potential
as a new target for therapies against tuberculosis has also attracted
interest. The S. coelicolor and M. tuberculosis enzymes share a great deal
in common, allowing the former to be potentially used as a model for
the latter. Nevertheless, a few differences have been identified,
including a 23-fold lower affinity of the M. tuberculosis enzyme for its acceptor substrates. It has been suggested that this could be due to a longer loop on
the enzyme’s surface that could have an impact on the acceptor
binding site. SAXS analysis has confirmed that both enzymes assemble
into similar homodimers but that the monomers within the M.
tuberculosis dimer are oriented somewhat differently. Whether
this could have an impact on enzyme activity is hard to ascertain.
Furthermore, it has not been possible to establish whether the longer
loop could have an impact on the acceptor site given the limited resolution
afforded by this technique. Nevertheless, the successful trapping
of a 2-fluoromaltosyl-M. tuberculosis enzyme intermediate
gives us confidence that the S. coelicolor enzyme
is a good model for the development of inhibitors of the M.
tuberculosis enzyme that target the donor site.
