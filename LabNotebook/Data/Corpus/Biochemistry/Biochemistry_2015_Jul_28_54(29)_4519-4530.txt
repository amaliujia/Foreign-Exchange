Bacterial mechanosensitive channels
gate when the transmembrane
turgor rises to levels that compromise the structural integrity of
the cell wall. Gating creates a transient large diameter pore that
allows hydrated solutes to pass from the cytoplasm at rates close
to those of diffusion. In the closed conformation, the channel limits
transmembrane solute movement, even that of protons. In the MscS crystal
structure (Protein Data Bank entry 2oau), a narrow, hydrophobic opening is visible
in the crystal structure, and it has been proposed that a vapor lock
created by the hydrophobic seals, L105 and L109, is the barrier to
water and ions. Tryptophan scanning mutagenesis has proven to be a
highly valuable tool for the analysis of channel structure. Here Trp
residues were introduced along the pore-forming TM3a helix and in
selected other parts of the protein. Mutants were investigated for
their expression, stability, and activity and as fluorescent probes
of the physical properties along the length of the pore. Most Trp
mutants were expressed at levels similar to that of the parent (MscS
YFF) and were stable as heptamers in detergent in the presence and
absence of urea. Fluorescence data suggest a long hydrophobic region
with low accessibility to aqueous solvents, extending from L105/L109
to G90. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy data are consistent with
significant homo-Förster resonance energy transfer between
tryptophan residues from different subunits within the narrow pore.
The data provide new insights into MscS structure and gating.

Mechanosensitive
channels gate
in response to increased tension in the lipid bilayer that arises
from lowering of the external osmolarity (hypoosmotic shock).1−3 A major structural transition takes place to create a large, transient
transmembrane pore that is fully hydrated,4 which allows the transit of small, osmotically active solutes. The
pores are usually relatively nonspecific for the solutes, and only
molecular volume is a good predictor of which solutes might pass through
the channel. The channels have been demonstrated to play a major role
in protecting the mechanical integrity of the bacterial cell during
hypoosmotic shock5 and in stabilizing the
structure of chloroplasts and yeast endoplasmic reticulum.6−8 There are two major types of channels, MscL (the channel of large
conductance) and MscS (the channel of small conductance),5,9,10 where the latter is a large family
of proteins with many structural variations.11 Through crystallography, molecular dynamics, biophysical approaches,
and molecular genetics, we have come to understand much about the
structure of the pore of MscS and the gating process.4,12−20

Multiple structures of MscS from different organisms in both
nonconducting
(closed)12,21 and conducting (open) configurations19,21 (a further structure from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis may also be in the closed state22) have
been determined. A more condensed state has been proposed on the basis
of molecular dynamics.17 Central to understanding
the mechanism is the nature of the closed pore. Thus, the crystal
structure shows MscS to be a homoheptamer (and indeed all MscS variants
studied to date exhibit masses consistent with a heptamer).23,24 Each MscS subunit has two transmembrane helices, TM1 and TM2, that
form a “sensor” paddle attached to the pore-forming
helix, TM3a. All seven subunits contribute a helix to the pore. A
pronounced kink after residue Q112 (Escherichia coli MscS numbering) leads to an amphipathic helix, TM3b, that has been
predicted to lie at the membrane interface with its hydrophobic surface
interacting with lipid chains and the hydrophilic face intercalating
with the β domain.12 The pore-forming
(TM3a) and pore-sensing domains (TM1 and TM2) are inserted through
the lipid bilayer, such that the amino-terminal residues are integrated
into the headgroup region of the outer leaflet of the membrane, are
periplasmic, or form a cap on the pore helices.25,26 This region is not resolved in any of the crystal structures.12,19,22 The open pore thus forms a conduit
connecting the periplasmic space with the cytoplasm, the latter being
achieved through portals formed in the large cytoplasmic vestibule.12

In the original crystal structure of the
nonconducting MscS, a
moderately large “hole” was evident that was, at least
partially, sealed by two rings of leucine residues (L105 and L109, E. coli MscS numbering).12 The
appearance of the protein suggested the possibility that an open form
had been captured. However, measurements of the pore by a variety
of methods showed that its diameter was inconsistent with the known
conductance of the channel.27 In parallel,
it was proposed, from MD simulations, that the pore was sufficiently
hydrophobic to create a vapor lock that would prevent a column of
water from forming in the pore and this would block ion conduction.28,29 Thus, the closed state is nonconducting by virtue of the hydrophobicity
of the residues facing into the pore and the tight packing of the
TM3a helices. When the open structure was determined,19 it was clear that the expanded state of the pore was achieved
by straightening the TM3a helices and their displacement from the
pore axis to create a water-filled pore. The diameter of this pore
was shown to be consistent with the known conductance.19

Tryptophan substitution mutagenesis has
proven to be a valuable
tool for the analysis of ion channel structure30−34 because the unique fluorescence properties of this
amino acid allow inferences to be drawn about the environment in which
the side chain is located. Tryptophan has the most stringent space
requirements of all natural amino acids not only because of its large
molecular volume (163 Å3) but also because of the
rigidity of the aromatic side chain. Accommodation of the Trp residue
in mutant channels may require an altered conformation that modifies
the stability and activity of the channel. However, the susceptibility
of Trp fluorescence to lipid-borne and soluble quenchers provides
valuable insights into the organization of the protein. For MscS,
we have previously shown that Trp can be substituted into the pore
for Leu at positions 105 and 109 and the resulting channels assembled
in the membrane and retained function in physiological assays, albeit
at a lowered level relative to that of the wild type.15,20 However, when purified, only the L105W variant was stable. This
suggested that Trp substitution mutagenesis would provide a useful
tool for investigating the pore of MscS, in particular for identifying
regions that are sensitive to perturbation. We have previously reported
the properties of a Trp-free MscS protein, MscSYFF.20 The mutant channel possesses protective ability in downshock
assays similar to that of the wild type, but in patch clamp assays,
it required a tension ∼50% higher than that of the wild type
to undergo the transition to the open state.20 We used this mutant protein for construction of Trp substitutions
at each position in pore-lining helix TM3a and at selected positions
in TM1 and TM2. In the closed state, TM3a helices pack tightly with
a “knobs and grooves” arrangement involving residues
98–101, 102–104, and 106–108.12,13 The other residues either face into the pore or interact with TM1,
TM2, or lipids. The data show that although the structure of MscS
may be perturbed by Trp insertion, most of the mutants form stable
heptamers that can be purified and reconstituted into lipid bilayers.
Modified activity was detected for the mutant channels, both by electrophysiology
and by their protective ability during hypoosmotic shock; only a few
mutant channels exhibited properties close to those of the wild-type
channel in one or more assays. At each position examined, the Trp
fluorescence exhibits unique properties with respect to emission maximum
and accessibility to water-borne quenching agents and the data are
consistent with a very hydrophobic pore.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
and Bacterial Strains
Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside
(IPTG) was obtained from Melford Laboratories
(Ipswich, U.K.), n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside
(DDM) from Affymetrix Anatrace (High Wycombe, U.K.), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) from Avanti (Alabaster,
AL), and all other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (Gillingham,
U.K.). E. coli strains MJF429 (Frag1 ΔmscS,
ΔmscK::Kan) and MJF612 (Frag1 ΔmscL::cm,
ΔmscS, ΔmscK::kan, ΔybdG::apr) were constructed
and characterized previously.5,24

Molecular Biology and Physiological
Assays
The pTrcMscSYFF
construct,20 with mutations W16Y, W240F,
and W251F, was used as a template to introduce tryptophan mutations
by applying the Stratagene QuikChange protocol. Mutations were confirmed
by sequencing on both DNA strands. Survival after osmotic downshock
was tested as described previously14 using
transformants of MJF612 grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (10 g/L
tryptone, 5 g/L NaCl, and 5 g/L yeast extract) containing 0.5 M NaCl
at 37 °C. At an OD650 of 0.2, expression of the mutated
MscS was induced by addition of 0.3 mM IPTG until the OD650 reached 0.3. In parallel, noninduced samples were prepared. The
cells were then diluted in LB medium (shock) or diluted in LB medium
containing 0.5 M NaCl (control). After incubation for 10 min, serial
dilutions were made and spread on LB agar plates with or without 0.5
M NaCl. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and colonies
were counted. It should be noted that the relationship among channel
abundance, channel activity, and survival is a complex one for both
MscS13,14,35 and MscL.36 A more complete discussion of the factors determining
the outcome of this assay is provided elsewhere.35,37 Electrophysiological experiments were performed as described previously.5,13 Giant protoplasts were generated from MJF429 cells transformed with
the relevant constructs after induction with 1 mM IPTG for 15–45
min. Excised, inside-out patches of the protoplasts were analyzed
by patch clamp at a membrane potential of −20 mV using the
same buffer on both sides of the membrane [5 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 200
mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM CaCl2]. Recordings
were performed with an AxoPatch 200B amplifier and pClamp software
(Axon) at a sampling rate of 50 kHz and filtration of 5 kHz. The pressure
ratios relative to the pressure threshold of MscL (PL:PS) are given as a relative
indicator of the pressure required to open the mutant forms of MscS
as described previously.38 This analysis
could be applied accurately only to channels that exhibited frequent
stable openings such that the pressure at which two channels are open
simultaneously could be determined.

Purification of MscS Tryptophan
Mutants
Purification
of the MscS tryptophan mutants followed the protocol established previously.15,20 Membranes were solubilized by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in
1.5% DDM containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, 50 mM imidazole, and 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF, Sigma). Aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 3000g for 10 min and filtration using a 0.2 μm syringe
filter. MscS was then bound through its C-terminal His6 tag to a prepacked 0.5 mL nickel-nitrilotriacetic (Ni-NTA) agarose
column (Sigma) and washed with 20 mL of buffer A [50 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 7.5) containing 0.05% DDM, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 50 mM
imidazole]. After storage overnight at 4 °C, MscS was eluted
with elution buffer B (buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole). Peak
fractions were separated on a HiPrep Superdex 200 16/600 size exclusion
column (GE Healthcare) at a rate of 1 mL min–1 using
a buffer containing 0.03% DDM, 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), and
150 mM NaCl. The ratio of heptamers to monomers was used as a guide
to the stability of the mutated channel complex. For fluorescence
measurements in bilayers, MscS was reconstituted by dilution into
DOPC following a protocol described in detail in ref (39). In short, MscS solubilized
in DDM was mixed with DOPC solubilized in sodium cholate (Sigma) at
a molar ratio of 1:100 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.
Then the mixture was diluted 30-fold, far below the critical micelle
concentration for the detergents, into the measuring buffer containing
40 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EGTA, and emission spectra
were recorded after equilibration for 5 min.

Blue Native Polyacrylamide
Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)
MscS constructs were transformed
into MJF612 and grown to an OD650 of 0.4 in 120 mL of LB
medium. MscS was induced by addition
of 0.3 mM IPTG and incubation continued for 30 min at 37 °C.
Expression of mutant MscS channels in this study did not cause impaired
growth upon induction of the transformed E. coli strain.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation and kept at −80 °C
until further use. The cell pellet was suspended in 5 mL of PBS buffer
[137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and
2 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)] supplemented with 0.2
mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and lysed by a single passage
through a French press at 18000 psi. After centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min, 3.2 mL of the supernatant was centrifuged
at 100000g for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane pellet
was suspended in 125 μL of PBS and frozen in small aliquots
at −80 °C until further use. The total protein concentration
was determined by the Lowry assay.40 Membrane
suspensions corresponding to 30 μg of protein were solubilized
in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1% DDM, 2.8 M urea, and 1 mM EDTA
for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged at 14000g for 10 min at 4 °C. After addition of native sample
buffer and Coomassie G-250 [as per the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen)] to the supernatant, samples were loaded onto Novex 4
to 16% Bis-Tris gradient native gels (Invitrogen) and run at 150 V
for 2 h. Details of the gel PAGE and the Western blotting followed
the protocol of the supplier (Invitrogen).

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Fluorescence spectroscopy
was performed as described in detail previously15,20 using an FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer from Edinburgh Instruments
(Livingston, U.K.). For steady-state emission spectra, tryptophan
was excited at 295 nm with a slit width of 2 nm and the emission was
recorded between 300 and 420 nm with a slit width of 2 nm. Reconstituted
samples were measured with slit widths of 3 and 7 nm. A 0.2 mL micro
cuvette with 10 mm excitation and 4 mm emission path lengths was used
(Hellma). The excitation polarizer was set to 90° and the emission
polarizer to 0°.41 The spectrum was
fitted to a skewed Gaussian after correction with a buffer spectrum:1 where I is the wavelength-dependent
fluorescence intensity, Imax the maximal
intensity, b a skewing factor, λ the emission
wavelength, λmax the wavelength of the peak, and
ωλ the width of the peak at half-maximal intensity.
Quenching by acrylamide in the concentration range of 0–0.2
M was quantified using the Stern–Volmer equation:2 where I0 and I are the fluorescence
intensities in the absence and presence,
respectively, of a quencher at concentration [Q]. KSV is the Stern–Volmer constant, which quantifies
the dynamic quenching for a given position.

Steady-state anisotropy r was measured at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and
in an emission range of 340–360 nm both with a slit width of
2 nm. The anisotropy was determined according to eq 3 considering the instrumental G factor = Ihv/Ihh:3 The first
and second subscripts indicate the
position of the excitation and emission polarizers (v for vertical
and h for horizontal), respectively.

Results
Expression
and Stability of the MscS Trp-Substituted Channels
With the
single exception of A106W, expression and integration
into the membrane were observed (as detected by Western blot for the
His tag) for all the mutated MscS channels (Figure 1A). Blue native (BN) PAGE analysis in combination
with Western blots is a convenient tool for assessing the oligomeric
state of MscS without the requirement for full purification.42 Preliminary work established that detergent
solubilization alone did not destabilize the protein. Thus, the oligomeric
state was assessed by incubation under mildly destabilizing conditions
(2.8 M urea and 1 mM EDTA). Under these conditions, wild-type (WT)
MscS, YFF, and 14 of 25 mutant proteins were essentially heptameric
(Figure 1B). Only seven
of the mutant channels exhibited significant levels of monomer after
extraction in the presence of urea and EDTA (G90W, T93W, V96W, V99W,
V107W, G108W, and A110W). Five other mutants exhibited some breakdown
of the heptamer in the presence of urea. Thus, the majority of the
Trp mutants display remarkable stability. This observation was supported
by analysis of a limited series of proteins by size exclusion chromatography
utilizing just those channels that were subsequently studied by fluorescence
(Figure 2). For fluorescence
analysis, it is critical that the properties of the Trp residues reflect
the heptameric state rather than any monomers that might arise after
extraction from the membrane. Five of 14 mutants exhibited significant
levels of monomer in the purified protein. Thus, WT protein eluted
from the size exclusion column predominantly as a single symmetrical
peak (Figure 2). We
have previously reported that L109W is unstable and this protein was
used to validate the assay (Figure 2).15 Unstable proteins,
particularly R88W, I97W, A98W, and G101W, exhibited increased amounts
of the monomer and decreased amounts of the heptamer. Some mutant
proteins exhibited a shift in the elution volume (e.g., N30W and Q112W),
and the elution profile for others exhibited a small peak on the leading
shoulder for the heptameric protein consistent with formation of higher-order
oligomers (A94W, A98W, and G113W). G90W, which was expressed well
(Figure 1A) but very
unstable in the presence of DDM and urea (Figure 1B), could not be purified in significant
quantities (Figure 2). The small amount of pure protein obtained was distributed between
the heptamer and monomer, again suggesting extreme instability caused
by the Gly to Trp change at this position.

were solubilized in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% DDM, 2.8 M urea, and

to 16% Bis-Tris gradient native gels (Invitrogen) and proteins detected
by Western blot as described for panel A. The positions of heptameric
and monomeric MscS with associated lipids and detergent are indicated.

the heptamer position for WT MscS.

Physiological Characterization of the Mutant Channels
By
three criteria [expression, stability after purification, and
BN-PAGE after DDM/urea extraction (Figures 1A,B and 2)], the majority
of the Trp mutants are stable proteins suitable for analysis. Previous
studies have established that the expression of MscS at the basal
level driven by the Trc promoter gives moderate protection to a strain
deleted for MscS, MscK, MscG (YbdG), and MscL (MJF612) and that overexpression
by induction with IPTG leads to complete protection.14 The survival assay works best as a predictor of loss of
either expression or function in mutated channel proteins.13,35−37 MscS channels that are poorly expressed or have impaired
function (or both) provide only limited protection, and this is most
easily seen when the channel expression has not been induced.37,43,44 The majority of the Trp mutant
channels failed to afford protection when expressed at this basal
level, which is 8–10-fold below the expression level normally
seen for the fully induced WT protein (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information and Figure 3A), but were protective after induction with
IPTG (Figure 3B). The
exception was T93W, which protected even when expressed at a basal
level (Figure 3A).
Several mutant channels (R88W, G90W, V91W, V96W, G108W, A110W, and
Q112W) exhibited complete loss of protective ability despite being
present in the cell membrane. Similar observations have been made
for some mutations affecting the MscL channel.45

Figure 3 Protection against hypoosmotic shock. Transformants of MJF612 (lacking
MscL, MscS, MscK, and YbdG) expressing individual MscS Trp mutants
were assessed for survival after a 0.5 M NaCl hypoosmotic shock. Mutants
were either expressed as a result of the escape promoter activity
of the pTrc promoter (A)14 or induced during
growth (B; 0.3 mM IPTG for 30 min) immediately prior to downshock
(see Experimental Procedures). Data are means
and the standard deviation of three independent cultures.

The electrical signature of the Trp mutant MscS
channels was investigated
using MscL as a reference point for the activation threshold for the
mutant channels.38 The electrical signatures
of the mutants were position-specific and could be broken down into
four principal groups with respect to the stability of the openings,
the conductance, and the pressure sensitivity. Seven mutants (M47W,
T93W, S95W, I97W, G101W, G104W, and L111W) exhibited essentially normal
channel openings, but there were small differences in the PL:PS ratio (Table 1 and Figure 4). However, the majority of
the mutants were found to exhibit either reduced conductance or no
conductance at all, and many also failed to form fully open states,
which precluded detailed analysis of their pressure dependence (Table 1 and Figure S2 of
the Supporting Information). Insertion
of Trp at positions V91, Q92, and A94, which all map to the neck of
the pore, generated channels that were expressed (Figure 1A), exhibited some protection
against downshock (Figure 3B), but failed to exhibit currents despite the observation
of MscL channels in the patches (Table 1). Three mutants (V96W, A103W, and V107W) opened to
the full extent, but the open state was unstable (Table 1).

Figure 4 Representative electrophysiology
traces for selected Trp mutants.
When assayed by patch clamp electrophysiology on isolated patches,
Trp mutants were found to have four different types of behavior. Three
are shown here: (a) WT-like, (b) short dwell, and (c) variable conductance
(the fourth type of behavior was the lack of channel activity in the
patch other than MscL, and these data are not shown). Additional data
are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information.

a Channel activity was measured
as described in Experimental Procedures using
cells expressing unique MscS variants that had been induced with IPTG.
Whereas the channels most like WT (YFF, M47W, and T93W) were induced
for 15 min with 1 mM IPTG, the other channels required an induction
period of up to 45 min for channels to be detected in the patches.
The voltage was set to −20 mV.

b WT indicates that the channel gives
rise to a stable open state typical of MscS with a conductance ∼1.1
nS.

c Only MscL openings were
detected
in patches with no evidence of MscS channel activity (n refers to number of patches in which MscL activity was detected
but no MscS).

d Flickery channels
failed to reach
a stable conductance equivalent to that of WT MscS, and multiple rapid
openings and closures were observed in response to increased pressure
on the patch.

e Two distinct
conductance states
were observed, with the second conductance state arising after the
application of further pressure.

f Insufficiently stable channel
openings were observed that correspond to the full conductance of
MscS, and therefore, PL:PS ratios could not be obtained.

A unique property was observed with V99W. At low pressures
(PL:PS = 1.8–2.4),
its conductance was similar to that of MscSYFF [∼1.1 ±
0.01 nS (n = 5)]; however, the channel flickered,
and transitions to subconducting states were frequently observed (Figure 5A), indicating that
the open state was unstable. However, if the pressure on the patch
was increased (PL:PS = 1.17–1.49), stable openings that were ∼50%
larger than that of the WT [1.64 ± 0.02 nS (n = 5) (Figure 5D)]
were observed, and these exhibited a stability similar to that of
MscS (Figure 5A). In
the closed crystal structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2OAU], V99 is exposed
in the crevice between TM1/TM2 and TM3a, which could accommodate the
increased volume of Trp (∼50% increase relative to that of
Val). In the open crystal structure (2VV5), it is observed that the
movement of TM3a outward from the pore axis (to create the open pore)
juxtaposes Val99 with Phe80, which could generate a potential conflict
between V99W and F80 causing an unstable open state, but at higher
pressures, the two residues might form a π–π stack
that stabilizes the more conducting stable state (Figure 5B,C). Thus, we created a V99W/F80A
double mutant to introduce a compensating drop in amino acid side-chain
volume at position 80 and to remove the potential for π–π
stacking. The resulting channel exhibited electrophysiological properties
close to those of MscSYFF (PL:PS = 1.54 ± 0.06; γ ∼ 1.1 nS; n = 3) (Figure 5A, bottom panel).

Figure 5 V99W generates two distinct open states. (A)
Opening of V99W at
“normal pressures” showed short dwell openings with
WT-like conductance (one asterisk, ∼24 pA), but as the pressure
was increased, channel openings (two asterisks) were associated with
higher conductance and stable openings were observed (∼34 pA,
∼1.7 nS) (top). In the double mutant, V99W/F80A, only stable
conductances of WT magnitude (∼23 pA, ∼1.2 nS) were
observed (bottom). The high conductance may be explained by a π–π
interaction between V99W and F80 on adjacent subunits (i.e., V99W:a
with F80A:b) in the open state (B; PDB entry 2VV5), whereas the residues
are well-separated in the closed state (C; PDB entry 2OAU) (V99W is colored
red and F80 green). Only two subunits are shown for the sake of clarity.
Models and figures were produced with PyMol. (D) Current-voltage plot

Polarity and Water Accessibility
Detected by Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Tryptophan is a sensitive
fluorophore that reports the physical
properties of its environment.46 We investigated
the fluorescence of detergent-solubilized MscS channels with Trp at
a number of positions between R88 and G113. Positions in TM3a in which
the native residue side chain is oriented toward the pore were chosen,
and in addition, three mutants were investigated in the periplasmically
exposed region of the closed crystal structure of the channel (N30W,
R88W, and G90W). Two further mutants were created as reference points:
D213W is located on the surface of the cytosolic domain and represents
a residue completely exposed to the bulk water phase, and M47W is
in the middle of TM1. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that
several mutant forms are less stable than WT MscS as discussed above.
These were in particular R88W, G90W, I97W, and A98W. If the protein
were a mix of heptamers and monomers in detergent, then this would
compromise the analysis of fluorescence because the data would represent
the mix of proteins in multiple different states. Anisotropy measurements
using separate pools of monomers and heptamers (see below) suggest
that the complex stays intact during measurement.

The peak position
for each of the Trp residues was blue-shifted relative to both the
native Trp residues in the soluble domain (λmax =
334 nm for W240 in a mutant in which the proximal Trp residue W251
had been mutated to Phe20) and the surface-exposed
Trp mutant, D213W (Table 2). The emission maxima clustered together for most of the
mutants with the exceptions of A103W, G101W, G113W, and D213W (Table 2 and Figure 6). The most blue-shifted, representing
the most hydrophobic environment, was A103W (λmax = 310.5 ± 0.4 nm), and this residue was least accessible to
quenching by acrylamide (Table 2 and Figure 6). This residue and T93W were the only residues we studied by fluorescence
in TM3a that are outward-facing (i.e., oriented away from the pore)
in the crystal structures. Overall, a correlation (R = 0.97) was seen between λmax and KSV, which reports accessibility to the aqueous quenching
agent, acrylamide.47 It is difficult to
predict the precise positioning of the Trp side chain in the mutants,
but the λmax and KSV values
(Table 2) are consistent
with a hydrophobic environment that is relatively inaccessible to
aqueous quenching agents (Figure 7), though in principle stationary water could also
cause a blue-shift of λmax depending on the position
of the water dipole relative to the fluorophore.48 A surprising observation was that Trp residues located
at positions L105 and L109 reported significantly polar environments
and were moderately accessible to acrylamide (Table 2 and Figure 7). Toward the cytosolic vestibule, the acrylamide accessibility
is increased at G113W, which is consistent with the higher λmax [329.7 ± 1.3 nm (Table 2)]. Our data agree well with bulk water accessibilities
determined by spin-labeling and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy in the presence of the relaxation agent NiEDDA.26,49 In particular, these data also show the low accessibility of the
funnel region (V89–A94).

Figure 6 Relationship between the λmax for Trp fluorescence
and KSV, the Stern–Volmer constant.
Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed as described previously15,20 on DDM-solubilized proteins. For λmax measurement,
Trp residues were excited at 295 nm with a 2 nm slit width and emission
was recorded between 300 and 420 nm with a slit width of 2 nm. A 0.2
mL microcuvette was used with 10 mm excitation and 4 mm emission path
lengths. For KSV, quenching by acrylamide
in the concentration range of 0–0.2 M was quantified (see Experimental Procedures). The data for L105W and
L109W are colored red.

Figure 7 Water accessibility and fluorescence anisotropy of the MscS pore
surface. (A) Accessibility to the bulk water phase was detected by
quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence by acrylamide. Strong quenching
is colored red and weak quenching blue. (B) Steady-state fluorescence
anisotropy is shown where blue indicates low values and red high values.
If the mobility is comparable for all mutants, the pore shape is reflected
by anisotropy because of the changing efficiency of homo-Förster
resonance energy transfer. For the sake of clarity, only five of the
seven subunits are shown. The figures were generated with PyMol on
the basis of the closed crystal structure (PDB entry 2OAU).

complex. For glycine residues, the corresponding modeled H atoms were
taken using PyMol. b values for Cβ atoms from the closed structure are given or, in the case of glycines,

Steady-State Anisotropy as a Tool for Obtaining Pore Shape Information
The steady-state anisotropy is sensitive to the mobility of the
fluorophore on the time scale of its fluorescence lifetime, which
is in the nanosecond range for tryptophan. Therefore, tryptophan anisotropy
is typically sensitive to side-chain rotation, but the overall tumbling
of MscS is too slow. Anisotropy is influenced by the mobility of the
fluorophore, but also by homo-Förster resonance energy transfer
(homo-FRET),50 and reflects the proximity
of two Trp residues. Fluorescence anisotropy may also be sensitive
to dissociation of the complex when homo-FRET between Trp residues
from different subunits is a significant factor51,52 (see below). Comparing the dissociated fraction from the SEC with
the heptameric fraction for I97W showed anisotropy (r = 0.180 ± 0.007 and r = 0.143 ± 0.004
for monomer and heptamer, respectively) and similarly for A98W (r = 0.165 ± 0.008 and r = 0.122 ±
0.01, respectively). These differences were maintained during measurements
with DDM-solubilized proteins, indicating that even for these more
fragile mutants the heptameric complex stayed intact for the fluorescence
experiments. Given that these were the least stable proteins, it is
reasonable to conclude that the fluorescence properties for all the
mutants principally reflect the heptameric state, but for the unstable
mutants, the results should be treated with more caution.

Steady-state
fluorescence anisotropy data mirror the shape of the pore in MscS.
Trp residues in TM1 (N30W and M47W) exhibited high anisotropy, reflecting
their relatively constrained position (Table 2). The M47W and N30W residues lie on the
mobile TM1–TM2 helix pair paddle and would not be expected
to exhibit significant Trp–Trp interaction. However, in the
highly packed pore domain, a low mobility and therefore a high anisotropy
would be expected. The lowest anisotropy was observed at the narrowest
part of the channel between A98 and Q112, but A103W was atypical in
exhibiting a high anisotropy consistent with an outward orientation
of this mutant and therefore low homo-FRET. At the periplasmic funnel
(R88–Q92) and at the cytosolic entrance to the vestibule (G113),
higher anisotropies were found, consistent with larger Trp–Trp
distances and therefore lower homo-FRET than in the narrow pore (Table 2 and Figure 7B). In the heptamer, the Trp
residues at the two seal rings (L105W and L109W) from the different
subunits must come close to each other, which would allow homo-FRET.
The Förster distance for Trp homo transfer (R0 ≈ 10 Å) is in the range of the closed pore
diameter.53,54 Measurements on the dissociated complex
from L109W confirm that the data are dominated by homo-FRET because
the dissociated complex of L109W has an anisotropy r of 0.172 ± 0.007 versus a value of 0.117 ± 0.002 within
the complex. A similar effect is seen for I97W, as reported above;
these residues are expected to be separated by ∼9 Å (measured
Cβ–Cβ distance) in the range
of residue separation in the closed pore. The cytosolic domain control
residue D213W exhibited a low anisotropy, suggesting a high side-chain
mobility that is consistent with the expected red-shift of the emission
maximum (Table 2).
Homo-FRET is unlikely to be a factor here because of the large distances
between the Trp residues (∼37 Å).

The anisotropy
data were fitted using the Cβ–Cβ distances of the same residue in neighboring subunits
obtained from the closed and open structures (PDB entries 2oau and 2vv5, respectively) assuming
a FRET mechanism. Previous analysis suggests that the channel is in
the open state when it is solubilized in DDM.55,56 The data could be fitted to Cβ–Cβ distances from either the open or the closed state, but the fit
was better for the latter (Figure S3 of the Supporting
Information). Data from the two extremities (Q92W and T93W,
and L109W and Q112W) of the pore appeared to cause a poorer fit for
the open state. However, elimination of these data either separately
or together improved the fit but not to give a result equivalent to
that for the fit for the closed state (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). These differences may
reflect the impact of Trp substitution on the balance between open
and closed states in DDM, which has previously been observed for MTSET-modified
Cys mutants of MscS.55 However, it must
also be noted that the Cβ–Cβ distances are not accurate representations for the fluorophore separations;
rather, they are just estimates and also make no allowance for structural
changes imposed by packing the Trp side chain. Further, one cannot
accurately predict the angles between the fluorophores, which is a
major factor for FRET.46

Reconstitution
of Trp Mutants into DOPC Bilayers
Reconstitution
of MscS into DOPC liposomes has frequently been used to study the
electrophysiological properties of the channel.9,58 Similarly,
a method has been developed for purification and reconstitution of
MscL Trp mutants into membrane fragments to investigate lipid–protein
interactions.59−61 We applied the latter method to purified mutants
of MscS and measured the emission spectra of the Trp residues. Six
positions were investigated (Figure 8); four were found not to exhibit significant changes
in their emission maxima upon being reconstituted (T93W, A103W, L105W,
and G113W), whereas A94W and G101W were red-shifted. The latter changes
are consistent with significant structural changes upon reconstitution
and with an environment that is more accessible to water. Thus, in
the Trp mutants, these residues may be exposed either in the pore
(both residues) or in the periplasmic funnel (A94W). BN-PAGE after
the fluorescence measurements showed that MscS retained the heptameric
state during reconstitution (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information).

into DOPC bilayers and the emission spectra recorded as described
in Experimental Procedures. (A) The red-shift

hydrophobic section of the pore. (B) The positions of the residues
are shown on the closed structure 2OAU. (C) Emission spectra of DDM-solubilized
samples (black) and samples reconstituted into DOPC (red) are compared.

Discussion
The
very special properties of tryptophan make it among the more
informative amino acid replacements that can be made.15,32,34,47,62,63 Care must
be taken with membrane proteins because of the known role of this
amino acid in controlling topology by anchoring the periphery of transmembrane
helices to the phospholipid headgroups of the bilayer.64,65 Mechanosensitive channels are notable in lacking these “anchorages”
but do contain Trp at other positions.44 We have previously established that only a mild impairment of function
results from replacement of the three native Trp residues in E. coli MscS with Tyr or Phe.20 The sensitivity to gating tension is significantly affected by W16,
which lies on the periplasmic side of the membrane and exhibits properties
typical of a Trp in a hydrophobic environment. A mutation to Tyr (W16Y)
mildly impairs the gating sensitivity compared to that of the wild
type.20 Thus, a Trp-free mutant (MscS YFF)
is both stable and active, and it was from this platform that the
current study was launched.

An important caveat attends Trp
scanning mutagenesis. Insertion
of the bulky Trp residue may perturb the packing of the protein, and
its accommodation may require either subtle or severe adjustments
of the structure depending on the position of the affected residue.
Indeed, the observed conductance values for I97W and G101W could be
interpreted to conflict with the open crystal structure (PDB entry 2VV5) but might be accommodated
by other models25 for the open state in
which the pore is predicted to be wider than seen in the open crystal
structures.4,19,25 However, such an interpretation would require an intimate knowledge
of the rotamer configuration in the Trp mutants. Thus, the crystal
structure is a reasonable guide only in the sense that one can analyze
the current packing for each native residue and understand what intrinsic
limitations may exist for the Trp substitution. This is graphically
illustrated for the least stable mutant G90W, which though expressed
and integrated into the membrane, is nonfunctional in physiological
assays, forms channels with diminished conductance and stability,
and readily dissociates in the presence of urea and detergent (Figure 1B and Table 1). Analysis of the MscS structure
(either open, 2vv5, or closed, 2oau) indicates that there is potentially room for the Trp side chain
projecting into the periplasmic funnel, which could explain how the
protein can be expressed and be inserted into the membrane. Some rearrangement
would be required because position 90 is surrounded by eight residues
within van der Waals distances (residues 86–89A, 91A, 92A,
87G, and 88G, where A and G refer to the subunits). Moreover, G90
forms the loop in which the torsion angles are Φ = +75°
and Ψ = −3° in the closed structure and Φ
= +55° and Ψ = +50° in the open structure. In the
Ramachandran plot,66 only G fits these
parameters and there must be conformational change to allow the G90W
mutation. This protein is then unstable once the lipid bilayer is
replaced by a DDM micelle. In contrast to this, T93W forms an essentially
WT channel; it is notable that Trp is found at the position equivalent
to T93 in the E. coli YjeP and MscK proteins. Equally
notable is the fact that insertion of Trp at positions adjacent to
T93 (i.e., Q92W and A94W) leads to channels that could not be detected
by electrophysiology despite good expression, a channel stable to
urea and DDM and protective function in physiological assays (Table 1).

Channel activity
was close to that of the wild type for only a
few of the mutants. For the others, the openings were of short duration
and exhibited reduced conductance. Where it could be measured accurately,
which relies on simultaneous openings of two channels,38 the gating tension measured in the PL:PS ratio was decreased [ratios
close to 1 (Table 1)]. For some of the positions, such as the packing residues (G101,
G104, G108, A98, A102, and A106), it was a surprise that these mutant
channels gated. From the closed structure, it is clear that the Gly
and Ala residues on the TM3a pore helix are in the proximity of each
other.13,67 Previously, we have shown that increasing
the bulk of these residues decreases the propensity to make the transition
to the open state. Thus, given the importance of residue size at these
positions,13 it was surprising to be able
to observe gating but no surprise that high pressure was required
on the patch to effect the structural transition (Table 1). Among the modified properties,
V99, N30, and R88 were most readily addressed from the crystal structures
of MscS. The residues in TM1 (N30) and TM2 (R88) are adjacent in the
crystal structure (Figure S5 of the Supporting
Information) and are predicted to form a H-bond (see the OCA
database for 2oau).68 Such proximity indicates a potential
packing change when Trp is substituted at either position. Correspondingly,
the properties of the two mutant channels are extremely similar (Figure 4). Novel residue–residue
interactions consequent upon introduction of a Trp side chain may
explain the observations for V99W. Two conductance states were observed:
short-lived openings (∼1.1 nS) at pressures associated with
gain-of-function (GOF) mutants (PL:PS = 1.8–2.4) and larger stable openings
(1.64 nS), in the normal range of gating pressure (Figure 5). In the closed state, the
V99W mutation can be accommodated between TM3a and TM1/TM2, possibly
with TM1/TM2 being moved in the direction found in the open state,
which would be consistent with the GOF properties in electrophysiological
assays. A further increase in pressure would juxtapose F80 on TM2
of the adjacent subunit with V99W on TM3a, such that the two residues
could stack and this might stabilize the channel in a “supra-open
state” with the observed higher conductance. Correspondingly,
the double mutant, V99W/F80A, exhibited conductance close to that
of the wild type, consistent with the open state now being accommodated
by the reduced molecular volume at residue F80A.

Keeping MscS
closed when the bilayer tension is low is essential
for preserving chemical and electrical gradients across the cytoplasmic
membrane and is as important as allowing specific passage of solutes
after gating.14,69,70 It has been proposed that the solution to this problem for MscS
is the creation of a vapor lock by two rings of leucine, L105 and
L109.25,28,29 Genetic data
have already established the importance of this seal, because substitution
of small residues, as in L105A and L109A, leads to channels that gate
more readily than the wild type.14 In addition
to the narrowing of the pore at this constriction, the hydrophobicity
of the walls is a second important factor to make an exclusion of
water energetically favorable29 and thus
generate a nonconducting state. Our data indicate that residues beyond
the hydrophobic seal at L105 and L109 toward the periplasmic side
may play an important role in the hydrophobic sealing of the closed
pore, supporting a model with a vapor lock that extends beyond the
seal residues.28 Fluorescence emission
maxima for Trp at positions that line the pore indicate particularly
low polarity and low accessibility to water-soluble quenchers in this
region. It was surprising to find a red-shift of the emission peaks
upon reconstitution of MscS into lipid bilayers in this region tested
on A94W and G101W. These data illustrate the problems that arise when
trying to reconcile mutant data with crystal structures and models
that are essentially derived from the WT protein. It would be expected
from the crystal structures and the models that A94 and G101 should
become more buried in the closed structure. One expects the closed
structure for the protein reconstituted into a lipid bilayer. However,
the A94W and G101W Trp residues report a more hydrophilic location
when the samples are transferred from the detergent-solubilized state
to being integrated in the membrane bilayer after reconstitution.
The relatively high polarities and accessibility to the acrylamide
quencher for the Trp mutants at L105 and L109 may be caused by the
mixed character of this amino acid, with the capacity for H-bonding
influencing the water structure in the mutants. However, spin-labeling
and EPR spectroscopy at these positions produced similar results.26 A low accessibility to the bulk water phase
was observed for an extended region from the hydrophobic seal toward
the periplasm; residues 98–104 become more accessible during
opening,19,49 and L105 shows a slightly higher accessibility.

Conclusions
Tryptophan scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that steric stringency
is important in two regions of the TM domain: at the hinge between
TM2 and TM3 and in the seal region from A106 to A110. Fluorescence
spectroscopy indicates that a hydrophobic region between seal residues
L105 and I97 may provide an extended vapor lock. Furthermore, it was
found that the periplasmic funnel is surprisingly hydrophobic despite
widening toward the water bulk phase. The N-terminal periplasmic domain
not resolved in crystal structures could cap the funnel and explain
these properties. Finally, fluorescence anisotropy was demonstrated
to be a potent tool in the structural biology of mechanosensitive
channels.
