Tropomyosin is an α-helical,
coiled-coil protein that, with troponin, is involved in the calcium-dependent
regulation of actomyosin activity. Each
Tm dimer lies along the surface of an actin filament and associates
in a head-to-tail manner into a linear polymer in which the C-terminal
section of a Tm dimer associates with the N-terminus of the next Tm
dimer. The overlap between adjacent Tms is relatively short, 11 amino
acids, compared to the overall length
of the molecule (284 amino acids per monomer). In the off or B-state,
each Tm covers the myosin binding site on seven actin monomers. Calcium
binding to troponin releases TnI from its binding site on actin, and
the Tm relaxes back to its preferred position on the actin surface
(C-state) where most of the myosin binding site is now exposed. Strong
binding of myosin to actin induces the Tm to move even farther from
the B-state to the M-state., The movement of Tm over
seven actins and the associated communication with the adjacent Tms
can result in significant cooperativity in the binding of calcium
to a single Tn or the binding of a single myosin to actin.

The human cardiac muscle tissue contains
α- and βTm
isoforms expressed as a mixture of αα homodimers and αβ
heterodimers. To date, 11 missense mutations in αTm have been
associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a pathophysiologic condition associated with an
impaired myocardial function resulting from enlargement or hypertrophy
of myocytes and consequent remodeling of the heart. This can in some
cases lead to sudden cardiac death. HCM
is primarily a genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal dominant
manner with an estimated incidence of one in 500 individuals. A plethora
of disease-causing mutations has been identified in the sarcomeric
proteins of the heart, including the protein
in which we are interested, α-tropomyosin (Tm).

Missense
mutations in Tm associated with HCM have so far only been
reported in the αTm isoform. Therefore αα, αα*,
and α*α* as well as αβ and α*β
Tm dimers (where an asterisk represents a point mutation) are expected
in affected individuals with a heterozygous background. Two of these
mutations, D175N and E180G, have been intensively studied− to characterize the biochemical and biophysical properties of the
protein and subsequently to understand the consequences of these mutations
for cardiac function. All of these in vitro studies of Tm carrying
cardiomyopathy mutations to date were conducted exclusively with homodimers
because of the lack of a reliable method for the assembly and purification
of Tm heterodimers. The reported results are not always consistent
with those found from in vivo models of the disease (human slow muscle
fibres, transgenic mouse models,, and adenovirus-mediated infected cardiomyocytes). In these in vivo models, Tm heterodimers may be the predominant
forms of Tm.

The aim of this study is then the identification
of the biophysical,
biochemical, and functional consequences of Tm HCM mutations in homo-
or heterodimeric form, based on the recently described method for
the formation in vitro and the subsequent isolation of Tm αβ
heterodimers.

We report here the
optimization of this method for the assembly
and purification of human cardiac αTm heterodimers carrying
HCM mutation D175N or E180G in one of the two α chains. We go
on to investigate the in vitro biochemical and biophysical properties
of these mutants at the molecular level. Our results demonstrate that
both D175N- and E180G-Tm readily form αα* heterodimers
and these assemble on actin with small changes in the apparent affinity
for actin. We also measure the thermal stability of the heterodimers
compared to that of the wild type (WT) and the homodimers carrying
the mutation in both chains. In vitro, the calcium activation of actin
filaments assembled with mutant Tms showed small changes to a lower
calcium level required for activation (0.08–0.14 pCa unit).
The largest change in calcium sensitivity was seen with E180G homodimers,
and this result was confirmed using rabbit skeletal myofibrils in
which the TmTn complex was extracted and replaced with human cardiac
TmTn with or without the mutation in Tm.

All of the mutations
produced relatively small effects, but noticeably,
the effect of the heterodimer was not always intermediate between
those of the WT and mutant homodimers. The study of homodimers is
not therefore necessarily a good predictor of the properties of the
heterodimer.

Materials and Methods
Protein Preparations
Native rabbit skeletal actin and
myosin S1 were prepared by the methods of Spudich and Watt and Margossian and Lowey, respectively. F-Actin used in the kinetic experiments was
labeled at Cys374 with pyrene iodoacetamide and stabilized by overnight incubation at 10 μM with a 1:1
ratio of phalloidin.

The rat α isoforms of Tm (WT-Tm,
D175N-Tm, and E180G-Tm) were expressed in Escherichia coli and had the Ala-Ser N-terminal extension shown to mimic the N-terminal
acetylation of the native αTm., WT-Tm and
its HCM mutants were cloned as described previously. Note that the rat αTm protein sequence differs from
the human sequence at a single site, R220 in human versus K220 in
rat (UniProt entries P09493 and P04692 for human and rat forms, respectively).
The formation and isolation of defined Tm heterodimers required the
production of WT-Tm with a His6 affinity tag followed by
the Factor Xa protease recognition site and Ala-Ser N-terminal extension.
His-Tm was cloned as described in ref () with the following N-terminal sequence.

All the generated Tm clones were transformed into
BL-21 E. coli and expressed and harvested as previously
described. All nontagged forms of Tm
with the Ala-Ser N-terminal
extension were purified by ion exchange chromatography using HiTrap
Q HP columns (GE Healthcare). The His-Tm (αα wild type)
purification was conducted via a Ni-NTA column matrix (QIAGEN Ltd.).
Both purification methods are described in detail by Kalyva et al.

Recombinant human cardiac Tn subunits
hcTnC (UniProt entry P63316),
hcTnI (UniProt entry P19429), and hcTnT (UniProt entry P45379-6) were
overexpressed in BL-21 E. coli and reconstituted
and purified as described by Al-Sarayreh.

Thin filaments used in the kinetic binding assays were assembled
by incubating F-actin, cTn, and Tm in a 2.5:1:1 ratio for 1 h. The
calcium sensitivity of thin filaments was tested by the stopped flow.
The experimental procedure is described in detail in .

Formation and Purification of WT-D175N- and WT-E180G-Tm Heterodimers
The formation of defined αα* Tm heterodimers was performed
as previously described by Kalyva et al. αα* Tm heterodimers were assembled by mixing WT His-Tm
with a nontagged homodimer of the Tm carrying a point HCM mutation
(α*α* Tm) in a ratio 1:4. The high ratio of untagged to
tagged Tm resulted in a low level of doubly tagged dimers simplifying
the purification. The sample was heated to 58 °C in the presence
of DTT to generate a mixture of Tm monomers and then cooled to 37
°C for 1 h, and the monomers were allowed to reanneal into dimers.
Tm carrying zero, one, or two His tags was separated using a TALON
Superflow metal affinity resin column (Clontech) connected to an FPLC
system (ÄKTA). Samples were collected and analyzed on a 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel (see Figure ). For further details, see .

Thermal Unfolding of Recombinant Tropomyosins Using Circular
Dichroism
CD spectra and unfolding isotherms were collected
on a Jasco 715 spectropolarimeter (software, spectra management version
1.51.00) in a stoppered 1 mm cuvette (Starna Scientific Ltd.) as described
by Kalyva et al. All measurements were
performed in 20 mM KPi (pH 7.0), 0.5 M KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2. Thermal unfolding was recorded at a fixed wavelength of
222 nm over a temperature range from 5 to 65 °C using a Peltier
device (Jasco PTC 423S/15) and a temperature increasing at a rate
of 1 °C/min. The final concentration of all Tm samples was 7
μM. The reversibility of the unfolding–refolding process
was assessed by reheating the Tm sample directly after it had been
cooled from the previous temperature scan. The temperature scans were
repeated three times without and three to four times with 1 mM DTT
added.

The CD data from thermal unfolding experiments were analyzed
using MicroCal Origin version 8.6. The isotherms were smoothed (Savitzky–Golay
method, 50-point window), differentiated, and then fit to multiple
Gaussian peaks.

Cosedimentation and Densitometry
Cosedimentation assays
were performed as previously described by Coulton et al. F-Actin at 7 μM was mixed with increasing
concentrations of Tm (0.2–2.4 μM) at 20 °C in 20
mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 100 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2 to a final
volume of 100 μL. The samples were incubated for 1 h. The Tm
bound to F-actin was pelleted by centrifugation at 370000g for 20 min (Beckman TL100A). Equivalent samples of the pellet and
supernatant were then assessed via 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE). Densitometry analysis was conducted
by using an Epson Perfection V750 Pro scanner and ScionImage (Scion
Corp., Frederick, MD). The free Tm concentration was plotted against
the fractional actin saturation (θ), and the Hill equation [θ
= [Tm]h/(K50%h + [Tm]h)] was used for determination of the Hill coefficient (h) and the midpoint of the fitted curve (K50%) (Table ).

Affinities of Tm for Actin

WT-D175N-Tm	0.23 ± 0.05	2.5 ± 0.5

WT-E180G-Tm	0.27 ± 0.03	2.1 ± 0.5

Transient Kinetics
The thin filaments were reconstituted
by mixing 5 μM phalloidin-stablilized pyrene actin (ppA) with
2 μM Tm and 2 μM hcTn in 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 100 mM KCl,
5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. All the proteins were incubated
for 1 h at 4 °C to ensure the full saturation of the actin filament
and then diluted as required. All concentrations refer to those after
mixing in a 1:1 ratio in the stopped flow.

The change in the
pyrene actin fluorescence was monitored by the stopped-flow fluorimeter
(SF-61DX2 spectrophotometer, HiTech Scientific) at 20 °C. Pyrene
was excited at 365 nm, and the fluorescence emission was then detected
through a KV 399 nm cutoff filter. All the measured data were analyzed
with the Kinetassist software provided with the instrument. Each transient
was the average of at least five shots.

Initially, the quality
of the thin filament proteins was assayed
by mixing 0.25 μM S1 in the absence of calcium with a 10-fold
excess of actin (2.5 μM) and 1 μM WT-Tm and increasing
concentrations of hcTn. The observed reaction was a single-exponential
reaction, and the observed rate constant (kobs) decreased as the hcTn concentration increased until saturation,
typically at 2.5 μM hcTn with a kobs of 2.0 s–1. The hcTn required for saturation was
used in all subsequent measurements with the same batch of hcTn. Repeating
the reaction with a saturating level of Tn in the presence of calcium
typically increased kobs 3.5-fold to 7.0
s–1, close to the value in the absence of Tn (8.0
s–1)., The ratio of the kobs value in the presence (2 mM Ca-EGTA) and
absence of calcium (2 mM EGTA) was used to calculate the equilibrium
constant KB, the equilibrium between the
blocked and closed states of the thin filament as defined by the three-state
model of thin filament regulation. The rate constant for binding of
S1 to an excess of actin sites is defined as kobs = [A]k × KB/(1 + KB), where [A]k is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for binding of S1 to actin
and KB/(1 + KB) is the fraction of actin sites in the on state. In the presence
of Ca2+, all the sites are available and kobs = [A]k. KB was therefore calculated from the ratio of the observed rate constants
in the presence and absence of calcium: kobs+Ca/kobs–Ca = (1 + KB)/KB.

For experiments in which [S1]
≫ [actin], thin filament proteins
were diluted to final concentrations of 0.25 μM actin, 0.1 μM
Tm, and 0.1 μM hcTn and mixed with 2.5 μM S1. The experimental conditions were as described
above with the addition of 2 mM EGTA and 2 mM Ca-EGTA to give defined
Ca2+ concentrations from pCa 9.8 to 4.6. The volume ratios
of EGTA and Ca-EGTA were calculated with WEBMAXCLITE version 1.15.

Myofibril Experiments: Preparation, Endogenous Regulatory Protein
Replacement, and Force Recording
Myofibrils were prepared
by homogenization of glycerinated rabbit psoas muscles, as described
previously. All solutions were kept around
0 °C and contained a cocktail of protease inhibitors, including
leupeptin (10 μM), pepstatin (5 μM), phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (200 μM), E64 (10 μM), NaN3 (500 μM),
and DTT (0.5 mM).

Endogenous Tm and Tn were replaced in rabbit
skeletal muscle myofibrils with hcTn and αTm (WT; WT-E180G-Tm
and E180G-Tm) as previously described., The extent
of the Tm–Tn extraction and replacement was 98% complete as
assessed by 12% SDS–PAGE analysis.

For force recording, a small
volume
of the myofibril suspension was transferred to a chamber (15 °C)
filled with a relaxing solution (pCa 9.0) on an inverted microscope
and mounted horizontally between two glass microtools. One tool was
connected to a length control motor that could produce rapid (&lt;1
ms) length changes. The second tool was a calibrated cantilevered
force probe (2–6 nm/nN; frequency response of 2–5 kHz).
Myofibrils were activated and relaxed by rapid translation of two
continuous streams of relaxing and activating solutions with different
pCa values (9 and 4.5) flowing from a double-barrelled glass pipet
placed within 0.5–1 mm of the preparation. The maximal force
(P0), the rate of force development (kACT), and the rate of force redevelopment following
release–restretch protocols (kTR) were measured at submaximal and saturating pCa
levels.

Activating and relaxing solutions, calculated as previously
described, were at pH 7 and contained
10 mM total EGTA
(Ca-EGTA:EGTA ratio set to obtain the different pCa used), 5 mM MgATP,
1 mM free Mg2+, creatine phosphate (CP, 10 mM), 10 mM MOPS,
propionate, and sulfate to adjust the final solution to an ionic strength
of 200 mM and monovalent cation concentration of 155 mM. The concentration
of contaminant inorganic phosphate (Pi) from spontaneous
breakdown of MgATP and CP was ∼500 μM.

Results
Formation and Purification of Tm Heterodimers
The method
of preparing heterodimers is essentially that of Kalyva et al., as outlined in . Briefly, His-Tm (αα) was mixed with the
Tm carrying a point HCM mutation (α*α*) in a ratio of
1:4. The mixture was heated at 58 °C for 10 min in the presence
of 20 mM DTT and then cooled to 37 °C for 45 min to allow dimer
formation. DTT was removed via gel filtration (Econo-Pac 10DG). The
Tm dimers were catalytically cross-linked at Cys190 by incubation
in 10 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 2 μM CuSO4, 2 M NaCl, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7) buffer at 35 °C overnight. The cross-link was formed to trap Tm dimers
for purification. The sample was then dialyzed in 300 mM KCl, 20 mM
KPi, 2 mM MgCl2 (pH 7) column buffer.

The mixture of dimers was purified by affinity chromatography using
a 25 mL TALON Superflow metal affinity resin column. The mixture of
Tm dimers applied to the column was washed with 100 mL of wash buffer.
The flow-through contained only nontagged Tm. The His-tagged dimers
were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 250 mM imidazole. The
high concentration of imidazole prevents the monitoring of Tm dimer
elution by the absorbance at 280 nm. The protein content of eluted
fractions was therefore monitored by running a 10% SDS–PAGE
gel under nonreducing conditions as shown in Figure . Lanes 2 and 3 show
His-WT and D175N-Tm homodimers as controls, respectively. Heterodimers
with only one His tag were eluted first (lanes 4–12), followed
by a mixture of singly and doubly tagged Tm dimers at higher imidazole
concentrations, and both migrated with apparent molecular masses close
to 85 kDa. Lanes 4–14 show also a minor fraction of heterodimers
that were not cross-linked (two bands of tagged and nontagged Tm monomers
with similar intensity at ∼30 and 25 kDa, respectively). The
elution profile of the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer is shown in Figure
S1 of the .

of α His-tagged WT-D175N-Tm heterodimers. Proteins were eluted
by linear gradient from 0 to 250 mM imidazole: lane 1, molecular mass
markers; lane 2, mixture of His-Tm dimers and monomers; lane 3, D175N-Tm
dimers; lanes 4–12, His-tagged WT-D175N-Tm heterodimers; lanes
13 and 14, mixture of both His-tagged WT-D175N–Tm heterodimers
and His-Tm homodimers. Samples were run on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis gel under nonreducing conditions.

The fractions containing Tm heterodimers were pooled
together,
and the purity was checked via 4–12% SDS–PAGE (Figure ). The heterodimers were concentrated by precipitation
at pH 4.6 and collected by centrifugation at 4200 rpm for 12 min.
Pelleted protein was dissolved in FXa protease reaction buffer [20
mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 (pH 6.5)], and
the concentration was measured. The His tag was proteolytically cleaved
from heterodimers with FXa protease digestion. Figure  shows the isolation and purity of the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer
before and after His tag digestion. Lanes 2 and 3 show His-Tm and
D175N-Tm homodimer controls under nonreducing conditions, respectively.
The His-Tm dimer does not form a cross-link as readily as nontagged
Tm and is shown as a mixture of monomers and dimers that migrated
with apparent molecular masses of 39 and 85 kDa, respectively. Lane
4 shows the expected 1:1 ratio of tagged and nontagged Tm arising
from the heterodimer under reducing conditions [β-mercaptoethanol
(BME) was used to reduce disulfide bonds]. The same sample under nonreducing
conditions (Figure , lane 5) shows a single
dimer band as evidence of the pure His-tagged WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer
with an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa. The final WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer
after His tag digestion (Figure , lane 6)
showed a single band under reducing conditions as WT and D175N-Tm
run together under these conditions. The purity of heterodimers was
measured by gel densitometry (described in ). Two bands of the purified His-tagged WT-D175N-Tm
heterodimer under reducing conditions (Figure , lane 4) showed a 4% difference in density, which indicates a 96%
purity of heterodimers. Additionally, the intensities of the WT and
D175N-Tm bands from cosedimentation assays (Figure A) were compared, and a 5% difference in the density between
two Tm bands was measured (95% heterodimers). The ratio of α
and α* monomers was checked routinely for both tagged and nontagged
heterodimers. The isolation and purity of the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer
is shown in Figure S2 of the .

Isolation and purity check of Tm heterodimers: lane 1, molecular
mass markers; lane 2, mixture of His-Tm dimers and monomers; lane
3, D175N-Tm dimers; lanes 4 and 5, assembled and purified His-tagged
WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer under reducing conditions and cross-linked,
respectively; lane 6, WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer after removal of the
His tag under reducing conditions. Samples were run on a 4–12%
SDS–PAGE gel.

The yield of the heterodimer was 11 mg from a starting
mixture
of 23 mg of His-Tm and 92 mg of α*-Tm. The homodimer proteins
can be recycled in further rounds of heterodimer assembly.

The
molecular mass of the purified recombinant Tm proteins was
determined by mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-Q II).
The measured molecular mass of the WT-Tm dimer was 65676.04 Da compared
to the expected mass of 65675 Da. The masses of both heterodimers
were within 0.9 Da of the expected masses. Compared to the WT dimer,
the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer had the predicted 72.1 Da decrease in
mass, which was 144.3 Da for the homodimer. The D175N-Tm homodimer
is predicted to have a mass 2 Da larger than that of the WT and 1
Da larger than that of the heterodimer. These masses were observed
for D175N-Tm but are not very distinct between the WT and D175N dimers.

Thermal Stability Assays
Tm has the characteristic
CD spectrum of a coiled-coil α-helical protein (see the inset
of Figure A). The thermal stability of cross-linked
or reduced Tm dimers was examined using CD at 222 nm. Figure  shows unfolding isotherms of homo- and heterodimers
over the temperature range of 5–65 °C. Each sample was
heated to 65 °C and then cooled a total of seven times: three
times in the absence of 1 mM DTT (the thiol-cross-linked Tm dimers)
and four times in the presence of 1 mM DTT. The unfolding profile
measurements under nonreducing conditions were almost identical for
every sample, indicating the reversibility of the unfolding reaction.
The first measurement after addition of 1 mM DTT showed both a decrease
in thermal stability and the oxidation of the cross-link. The three
subsequent measurements were again identical.

Thermal unfolding of
αTm homo- and heterodimers carrying
HCM mutations compared to WT-Tm. Normalized unfolding profiles of
7 μM homodimers (solid lines) and heterodimers (dashed lines)
of D175N (A and B) and E180G (C and D) in the presence (B and D) or
absence (A and C) of 1 mM DTT. Buffer conditions: 0.5 M KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The CD
spectrum of 7 μM αD175N-Tm in the range of 195–250
nm is shown in the inset of panel A.

Figure A shows the unfolding
profile for
the third heating cycle of the cross-linked WT homodimer superimposed
on the profile of the D175N homodimer and the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer.
All these almost identical profiles show a major unfolding event at
∼57 °C and a minor one at ∼37 °C. The first
derivative of the curves resolves a third, smaller domain with a midpoint
at ∼49 °C (see the ).

After addition of DTT (Figure B)
to reduce
the Cys190 cross-link, the WT profile showed a reduction in the size
of the event at 37 °C. The 57 °C event occurred at a lower
temperature of ∼53 °C, and the intermediate event was
unchanged at 49 °C. The D175N homodimer was more stable than
WT by ∼1 °C, and the heterodimer was similar to the WT
below 40 °C but closer to the D175N homodimer above 45 °C.
The details of what is happening to the unfolding domains are shown
more clearly in the first differential of the data (see the ).

The unfolding
profiles for the third heating cycle of cross-linked
homo- and heterodimers of E180G-Tm are shown in Figure C. There is a significant loss of thermal stability at ∼30
°C that is proportional to the number of Tm mutations. The profile
of the double E180G-Tm mutant exhibits its first thermal transition
at ∼30 °C, that of the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer at 35 °C,
and that of the WT at 40 °C. Above 45 °C all three Tm constructs
are identical. Reduction of the cross-link at Cys190 shows several
changes. Compared to WT, both dimers are less stable over the range
of 30–50 °C. The homodimer has a new transition at ∼42 °C,
and both hetero- and homodimers are apparently more stable without
the cross-link at 30 °C. Again the interpretation in terms of
three folding domains is clear when looking at the differentiated
data in the .

It is important to mention that both WT-D175N and WT-E180G-Tm heterodimers
under reducing conditions will reanneal into a mixture of αα,
αα*, and α*α* (the asterisk indicates a mutation)
in a ratio of approximately 1:2:1. For the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer,
this has little consequence as all dimers have similar unfolding characteristics.
For the WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer, this complicates the interpretation.
By subtracting 25% of the expected transitions for WT and E180G homodimers
(the expected proportion after reannealing), we can estimate the unfolding
transitions for the heterodimer. The error on such a process is large,
but it can indicate the underlying properties and is shown as a thick
gray line in Figure S3F of the . This does not alter the positions of the three transitions but
does alter their relative proportions where the area of all three
transitions is reduced by 55%.

Actin Binding Assays
The affinities of WT-D175N-Tm
and WT-E180G-Tm heterodimers for F-actin were measured using cosedimentation
assays (see ). Figure A shows the SDS–PAGE
analysis of the supernatant and pellets of centrifuged 7 μM
actin with 0.2–2.4 μM WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer.

Affinity of
Tm for actin determined by cosedimentation analysis.
Actin (7 μM) incubated with 0.2–2.4 μM Tm dimers
at 20 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 370000g. (A) SDS gels (10%) were used for analysis of actin and Tm in the
pellet and supernatant. (B and C) Plots of the fractional saturation
of actin by Tm as a function of free Tm concentration for (B) WT-Tm
(■), WT-D175N-Tm (○), and D175N-Tm (▲) and (C)
WT-Tm (■), WT-E180G-Tm (○), and E180G-Tm (▲).
The best fit to the Hill equation is superimposed on the data. The
actin affinities (K50%) and the Hill coefficients
(h) are listed in Table .
Buffer conditions: 20 mM MOPS, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 (pH
7.0).

Pellets show that almost all of the actin sediments
with a small
fraction, probably G-actin, remaining in the supernatant. Note that
the 10% gel used here under reducing conditions resolves the WT- and
D175N-Tm monomers. The similarity of the density of the two bands
is consistent with a pure heterodimer.

Figure B shows the sigmoid binding curves
of WT- and D175N-Tm constructs with F-actin as expected for Tm polymerizing
on the actin surface. Fitting the data to the Hill equation gives
an estimate of the affinity (K50%). The
apparent affinity (K50%) of the WT-D175N-Tm
heterodimer for actin (0.23 μM) was tighter in comparison to
that of the D175N-Tm homodimer (0.52 μM; p ≤
0.05). K50% for WT-Tm was indistinguishable
from that of the WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer, indicating that the introduction
of the D175N mutation in only one Tm chain does not have any effect
on binding to actin.

The binding curves of WT and E180G-Tm constructs
with F-actin are
shown in Figure C. The affinity of the E180G-Tm
homodimer was significantly weaker (0.42 μM; p ≤ 0.05) that that of the WT (0.20 μM), with the heterodimer
at an intermediate value (0.27 μM; p ≤
0.05). The obtained K50% values for HCM
Tm homodimers are consistent with previously published data. The Hill coefficients showed similar values
(2.1–2.8) for all αTm measured.

Calcium Sensitivity of S1 Binding to a Thin Filament
The following stopped-flow experiments were used to evaluate the
calcium-dependent occupancy of the blocked state of the thin filament. The thin filament was reconstituted with pyr-actin,
human cardiac Tn, and αTm carrying an HCM mutation (D175N or
E180G) in one or both chains of the Tm dimer. S1 (0.25 μM) was
rapidly mixed with a 10-fold excess of the pyr-actin·Tm·Tn
complex. Figure  shows the set of observed pyrene actin fluorescence transients with
each Tm construct in the absence (pCa 8.9) and presence of calcium
(pCa 4.6). Each transient is fit to a single exponential, and for
WT-Tm, the kobs values were 7.68 and 2.21
s–1, respectively, giving a ratio of the two values
of 3.5 (Table ). These are in good agreement
with previous measurements for cardiac Tn. The reduction in kobs at pCa 8.9 has
been interpreted as being caused by a fraction of the unavailable
actin sites and the ratio of rate constants kobs(−Ca2+)/kobs(+Ca2+) = KB/(1 + KB), where KB is
the equilibrium constant between actin·Tm·Tn complexes in
the blocked and closed states. For the WT, the ratio therefore defines KB = 0.4. The kobs and KB values for all Tm homo- and heterodimers
in the presence and absence of calcium are listed in Table . The derived values of KB indicate that the value is independent of the mutations as shown
previously for D175N- and E180G-Tm homodimers.

The calcium sensitivity of the thin filaments containing
the various
Tm dimers was measured as described previously., The experiment was conducted using a 10-fold excess of S1 binding
to thin filaments because of the limited yields of αα*
Tm heterodimers. In this assay, 2.5 μM S1 was rapidly mixed
with preincubated 0.25 μM pyr-actin, 0.1 μM cTn, and 0.1
μM αTm over a range of calcium concentrations. The inset
of Figure A shows the set of observed sigmoid
transients at different calcium concentrations (pCa from 4.6 to 9.8)
with thin filaments containing WT-D175N-Tm. Measurements for each
Tm were repeated three times (two independent samples of Tm were combined
with two independent samples of hcTn). Plots of the half-time of the
reaction (t1/2) against pCa for WT-D175N
and WT-E180G-Tm heterodimers are shown in panels A and B of Figure , respectively, with the best fit to the Hill equation
superimposed. The panels show the data for the WT and double mutants
for comparison. The midpoints (pCa50%) of the calcium-induced
change in t1/2 and Hill coefficients derived
from the fit to the Hill equation are listed in Table .

The pCa50% measurements exhibit increased
calcium sensitivity
of D175N- and E180G-Tm homodimers by 0.086 and 0.143 pCa unit, respectively.
WT-D175N- and WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer pCa values are 0.116 and 0.03
pCa unit higher, respectively, than that of the WT. The differences
in pCa50% are plotted in a bar graph (Figure C). The Hill coefficient did not show any significant changes
in the HCM mutants in comparison to that of the WT.

Functional Assay in Myofibrils Replaced for the Endogenous Tm·Tn
Complex
The following mechanical measurements in myofibrils
were taken to test the functional impact of human cardiac αTm
carrying an HCM mutation in one (heterodimer) or both chains (homodimer)
when present in the sarcomere. For this reason, we extracted endogenous
Tm and Tn and replaced them in rabbit skeletal muscle myofibrils, with hcTn and αTm (WT, WT-E180G-Tm, and E180G-Tm). Only the
E180G mutation has been used in these experiments, based on in vitro
findings showing the largest effect in increasing the sensitivity
of calcium activation of actin filaments.

As shown in Table , the presence of the E180G mutation in both heterodimeric
and homodimeric forms did not significantly affect maximally activated
force development (Po 4.5) or the
kinetics of its development (kACT and kTR). Resting sarcomere lengths were in the optimal
overlap range of rabbit psoas muscle, and differences in the two sets
of experiments reported in Table  were caused
by different myofibril batches. Interestingly, a clear effect was
present with the E180G-Tm homodimer when tension development at submaximal
calcium levels (pCa 5.8–5.9) was compared to the full activation
in Ca2+ concentration-jump experiments. As shown in Figure  and Table , myofibrils
replaced with the E180G-Tm heterodimer did not significantly differ
from control WT-Tm, while the presence of the E180G-Tm homodimer significantly
enhanced (see Table ) tension development
(i.e., thin filament activation) at low Ca2+ concentrations.
The differential effect of αTm homodimers versus heterodimers
on submaximal calcium-activated force seems clear even though for
αTm heterodimers the comparison was made at only one submaximal
pCa that was eliciting a relatively small amount of tension (Table ). On the other hand, calcium-independent tension
[pCa 9 (see Figure )], which signals the presence
of some myosin heads that can cycle in the absence of Ca2+, was not significantly affected by the E180G mutation in the heterodimeric
or homodimeric form.

Force response of skeletal myofibrils replaced for the
endogenous
Tm·Tn complex at submaximal and maximal levels of calcium activation
at 15 °C. Myofibrils replaced with the αTm heterodimer
(A) and homodimer (B) with the E180G mutation (right panels) or with
WT-Tm (left panels) were activated at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations
(pCa 5.85 in panel A and pCa 5.8 in panel B) and then subjected to
a Ca2+ concentration jump to full activation (pCa 4.5).

Discussion
The results of our study show a method for
the in vitro formation
of defined, cardiac αTm heterodimers, using bacterially expressed
αTm homodimers, and is optimized for αTm heterodimers
with HCM mutations D175N and E180G. The Tm HCM mutants do not show
any preference for homodimer over heterodimer formation as using a
combination of 50% α*Tm with 50% His-αTm produced a mixture
of dimers close to that predicted for random association with a ratio
of 1:2:1 (αα:αα*:α*α*). The ratio
of formed dimers shows that the introduction of the His tag into the
Tm molecule does not affect dimerization. This suggests that in the
heterozygous cell, if both WT and mutant proteins are expressed in
similar amounts then the heterodimer will form a large fraction of
the assembled dimer. Studies of the expression of Tm mutations in
cultured cardiac myocytes or in human
skeletal muscle biopsies show expression
levels of 40–50% of the mutant Tm. Thus, assembly of a significant
proportion of heterodimers is likely, but to date, this has not been
investigated in cell cultures, biopsies, or transgenic animals. It
ought to be possible to detect heterodimers in tissue samples if the
Tm can be cross-linked before isolation and analysis. However, note
that the difference between the WT and mutant may be too small to
detect by SDS–PAGE or mass spectrometry. Whether such Tm dimers
assemble into the thin filament or alter the calcium activation of
contraction will depend on how the heterodimers interact with the
other thin filament components.

Because the mutations do not
affect dimer formation, we considered
what other role the side chains of D175N and E180G in the homo- or
heterodimer might play in the overall function. These surface charge
residues are in a position to alter the stability of the Tm–Tm
contacts or alter the interaction with
actin (in position B, C, or M on the actin surface) or with troponin and hence alter calcium sensitivity.

Actin binding assays with D175N- and E180G-Tm homodimers showed
a weaker affinity of approximately 2.5-fold in comparison to that
of the WT (K50% = 0.21 μM), which
agrees with previous measurements. The
WT-D175N-Tm heterodimer had an actin affinity (0.23 μM) that
was not distinguishable from that of the WT, while the value of the
WT-E180G-Tm heterodimer (0.27 μM) was intermediate between those
of the E180G homodimer and WT. However, the physiological significance
in a muscle fiber is likely negligible because of much higher concentrations
of actin and Tm. These values show that all Tm dimers bind actin with
a tight apparent affinity, and under physiological conditions, all
will bind to actin. If all of the protein were present in the same
cell, there would be a very marginal preference for the WT over the
mutant proteins.

The thermal unfolding measurements of the reduced
WT and D175N-Tm
homodimer show two major thermal transitions at 47.5 °C (N-terminal
region) and 53.1 °C (C-terminal region) and a third at 41.2 °C.
These observations agree with previously measured data for WT-αTm
at high salt concentrations (0.5–1 M)., A high salt concentration was used to prevent end-to-end polymerization
of Tm that can confuse the melting isotherm. Similar studies of Tm
thermal unfolding at a low salt concentration (100 mM KCl) and an
∼3-fold higher protein concentration using differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) reported the thermal
transition of C-terminal region Tm at 50 °C and the N-terminal
region Tm at 42.7 °C. These differences are probably caused by
differences in the ionic strengths of the buffers. When the Tm is
cross-linked at Cys190, the most thermally stable domains are stabilized
with some loss of stability of the least stable domain.

The
thermal unfolding of the D175N-Tm homodimer, both reduced and
cross-linked, was indistinguishable from that of the WT as previously
reported, and unsurprisingly, the D175N
heterodimer was therefore also very similar to the WT.

The E180G-Tm
homodimer shows a decreased thermal stability compared
to that of the WT in agreement with the work of Kremneva et al. For the cross-linked homodimer, the least stable
domain unfolds at ∼26 °C, well below physiological temperature,
while the other two domains are similar to those of WT. When reduced,
the most stable domain is similar to the WT while the domain with
midrange stability is less stable by 5 °C at (42 °C). In
contrast, the least stable domain is only a little less stable than
the WT at 39 °C. This temperature is close to body temperature,
which led Kremneva et al. to speculate that this domain unfolding
could contribute to the pathology of this mutation particularly under
conditions where the body temperature is elevated, i.e., during fever
or intense exercise. For the heterodimer, the least stable domain
is intermediate between the homodimer and WT when cross-linked and
similar to the WT for the more stable domains.

It is important
to note that both mutations are close to the disulfide
cross-link at Cys190 and the cross-link could perturb the structure
around the mutation. This is difficult to rule out for the E180G-Tm
homodimer, but the observation that the D175N mutant has a stability
identical to that of the WT suggests little interaction between the
cross-link and the residue at position 175.

In the absence of
the cross-link, the interpretation is more difficult
because the protein will exist as a mixture of homodimers and heterodimers.
Even so, the mixture appears to be less stable than the pure E180G
homodimer at physiological temperatures with a midpoint transition
close to 36 °C. The presence of the WT and E180G homodimers would
tend to make this domain appear to be more stable, suggesting that
the heterodimer may be significantly less stable than either WT or
E180G homodimers and could be partially folded even at normal body
temperature. Note, however, that Tm is stabilized by binding to actin
and once bound would be resistant to unfolding. We conducted some
preliminary sedimentation studies of the E180G-Tm heterodimer binding
to actin at 37 °C and did not observe a significant loss of affinity.

Tropomyosin thermal stability may be directly related to the stiffness
or flexibility of the Tm, and flexibility is widely recognized as
an important parameter defining Tm function.− Any mutation-induced
change in Tm flexibility could have a significant effect on the interaction
with actin, the movement of Tm between sites on actin, and the accessibility
of myosin to its binding sites on actin. The D175N mutation has shown
no change in stability and is therefore not predicted to alter flexibility.
Recently, it has been shown that the E180G mutation increases the
local flexibility of the Tm molecule (in the homodimer) even when
bound to actin, and the same could be
true for the heterodimer. If the Tm thermal instability plays a role
in the pathology of HCM, it may occur through the metabolic load imposed
by the loss and clearing of misfolded Tm that is not bound to actin.

Many HCM mutations, at least in thin filament proteins, are associated
with an increase in calcium sensitivity; i.e., less calcium is required
to activate the thin filament, and conversely, if the same amount
of calcium is released because of a stimulus, more calcium has to
be removed from the cell before relaxation occurs. Previous work has
shown that D175N and E180G homodimers do show changes in calcium sensitivity
when in a fully assembled actin filament in in vitro motility assays
(IVM) or reconstituted fiber experiments,,, with E180G showing a greater shift than D175N. Our
measurements of the apparent calcium affinity for calcium switching
of the actin·Tm·Tn filament for homodimers (Table ) confirm this and show ΔpCa values of 0.08
for D175N and 0.14 for E180G. These are similar to the values we reported
using the same method (0.09 and 0.13, respectively) or estimated using IVM by Bing et al. (0.082 and 0.115,
respectively). Larger values, with lower precision, were reported
with IVM by Wang et al. (pCa50% values of 0.2 for D175N
and 0.64 for E180G) and by Bai et al
using reconstituted cardiac preparations (pCa50% values
of 0.03 for D175N and 0.64 for E180G).

Interestingly, important differences exist upon comparison
of homodimers
with heterodimers: in the case of the heterodimers, the WT-E180G-Tm
heterodimer had only a small ΔpCa (0.03) compared to that of
the WT, much smaller than that of the homodimer (0.14), while the
D175N heterodimer had a larger ΔpCa (0.11) that was not significantly
different from that of the homodimer (0.09). Thus, our data are compatible
with both homo- and heterodimers showing the positive shift in calcium
sensitivity expected for these HCM mutations and with the fact that
the value of the E180G heterodimer surprisingly is very small and
not significant.

The pCa shifts are small, and we tested if
the same change in sensitivity
could be seen in the sarcomere via replacement of the Tm·Tn complex
in rabbit psoas myofibrils with human cardiac Tm·Tn with either
WT-Tm or the E180G homo- or heterodimer. The results (Figure  and Table ) do show an
increased calcium sensitivity for the homodimer compared to that of
the WT but not for the heterodimer. This is compatible with the solution
data using pure actin·Tm·Tn filaments.

This work is
significant for two reasons. First, we establish that
heterodimers with only one mutation in the αTm can be formed
easily in vitro and therefore can be expected to form in vivo. Second,
we establish that the properties of the heterodimers are not simply
means of the properties of the two homodimers. Some properties are
intermediate like the affinity of E180G-Tm for actin, but others like
the thermal stability of E180G-Tm and the calcium sensitivity of D175N-Tm
heterodimers are more similar to that of the mutant homodimer than
to that of the WT homodimer. Tm αβ heterodimers showed
intermediate thermal stability, and the affinity for actin was weaker
than that of homodimers. This observation
is important also upon comparison of in vitro results, obtained exclusively
with homodimers of Tm carrying cardiomyopathy mutations, which results
in transgenic (TG) animals or human biopsies and clinical data. In
these last cases, the ratios of WT and mutant homodimers or heterodimers
are probably highly variable, and this would produce significant differences
in the extent of the modification of calcium sensitivity. Our results
provide insight into the molecular mechanism of phenotype modification
in the presence of cardiomyopathy mutations of Tm.

It should
be noted that the approach taken here to examine the
behavior of distinct heterodimers of Tm is distinct from the approach
taken by others, who have assembled a mixture
of homodimers (in various ratios) onto actin. If heterodimers are
formed in the cell, then the actin filaments may contain a combination
of both types of homodimer and the heterodimer on a single filament.
This is more complex than the situation described here and is more
difficult to assess. Different types of tags, probably fluorescent
tags, would be required to assess the Tm composition of individual
actin filaments.
