Phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH)
endows microorganisms with the ability to grow using phosphite (PT)
as the sole source of phosphorus. PTDH
catalyzes the oxidation of phosphite to phosphate with the concurrent
reduction of NAD+ to NADH (Scheme ). The reaction resembles a phosphoryl transfer process in which
water or hydroxide acts as the phosphoryl acceptor and hydride acts
as the phosphoryl donor. Thus, this reaction presents an unusual example
of an enzyme catalyzing a nucleophilic displacement reaction with
a hydride leaving group. Although at first glance this appears to
be an unfavorable process, analysis of the thermodynamics of the reaction
indicates it is 15 kcal/mol exergonic. As a result, the enzyme from Pseudomonas stutzeri WM88 has been adapted for use in cofactor regeneration, and mutants with increased activity and decreased substrate specificity, have been engineered, allowing the enzyme to accept NADP as a substrate.
PTDH with dual cofactor specificity has been fused to flavin monooxygenases,
and the resulting self-sufficient biocatalysts have been demonstrated
to have excellent activities for enantioselective catalysis.−

The accompanying paper () describes the X-ray structure of a thermostable
PTDH mutant (TS-PTDH).
TS-PTDH contains 12 mutations that result in considerably increased
thermostability with minimal change in activity, and four additional
mutations that increase its activity (for
mutations, see ). An
additional E175A mutation allows this mutant to use both NAD+ and NADP, and this mutant that is most versatile for cofactor regeneration
is termed 17X-PTDH. The X-ray structures of 17X-PTDH and TS-PTDH show
very similar positions of active site residues (). The kinetic isotope effects, pH dependence,
and pre-steady state kinetics observed with 17X-PTDH are all very
similar to those observed with wild-type (wt) PTDH, suggesting that these two proteins use the same mechanism
of catalysis. Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) studies with deuterium-labeled
phosphite and pre-steady state studies have shown that hydride transfer
is fully rate-limiting., The sequence of PTDH
is ∼25–40% identical with that of the family of d-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases (DHDHs), including several residues
that have well-defined roles in these enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis
studies of these amino acids have provided some insights into the
mechanism of phosphite oxidation,, but many questions
remain. For instance, it is not known if the reaction takes place
by a dissociative, concerted, or associative mechanism, in which hydride
transfer occurs before, during, or after attack by the nucleophile,
respectively. In addition, the timing of deprotonation of the water
nucleophile is unresolved and could occur before, during, or after
nucleophilic attack. For further discussion, see ref ().

The cocrystal structure
of TS-PTDH with NAD+ and sulfite,
a competitive inhibitor of phosphite, revealed
that Arg301 is within hydrogen bonding distance of a water molecule
adjacent to sulfite (). Arg301 is not conserved among members of the DHDH family, and
hence, it was not investigated in previous studies. However, as shown
in this study, Arg301 is conserved in putative PTDH proteins (vide
infra). Hydrogen bonded to Arg301 are two other conserved residues,
Ser295 and Tyr139, and Trp134 interacts with Arg301 through a water-mediated
hydrogen bonding network (Figure ). Tyr139
and Trp134 are contributed by the second monomer in the dimeric protein.

Stereoview
of the active site of TS-PTDH containing NAD+ and a sulfite
inhibitor. His292 is the likely catalytic base; Glu266
is hydrogen bonded to His292, and Arg237 plays a role in phosphite
binding., Trp134B, Tyr139B,
and Ser295 are hydrogen bonded to Arg301; residues colored pink are
from monomer B, whereas all other residues are from monomer A. Note
that the sulfite–NAD+–PTDH complex may not
be an exact representation of the active form of the ternary complex
with phosphite and must be used with caution. An image presenting
phosphite modeled in place of sulfite is presented in Figure S1 of
the .

For wt-PTDH, the pH–rate profile for kcat/Km,phosphite shows a bell-shaped
curve indicating that for optimal catalysis one group (on the protein
or the substrate) must be deprotonated and another group must be protonated. The pKa values deduced
from the curve are 6.8 and 7.8, respectively. The lower pKa corresponds well to the second acid dissociation constant
of phosphorous acid (the conjugate acid of phosphite), suggesting
that the enzyme may utilize the dianionic form of the substrate. The
higher pKa would then correspond to an
enzyme residue that must be protonated. One candidate would be His292
(Figure ), but if so, it could not be the
catalytic base that deprotonates the water nucleophile. One scenario
that would still allow His292 to serve as a base involves binding
of dianionic phosphite to PTDH with a protonated His292, followed
by the transfer of a proton from His292 to phosphite in the ternary
complex because of perturbed pKa values
in the ternary complex (Figure ). An alternative
interpretation of the data is that phosphite must be protonated and
His292 deprotonated for substrate binding. In this interpretation,
the minor, monoprotonated form of the substrate at the optimal pH
of 7.25 would bind to the minor form of the enzyme with a deprotonated
His (Figure ). Such a reverse protonation
scenario would result in an identical pH–rate profile because
both of these two protonation states of the substrate and enzyme would
have maximal occupancy at pH 7.25, decreasing at both higher and lower
pH values. Because the pKa values of the acidic and basic limbs of the PTDH pH–rate
profile are separated by &lt;2 pH units, it is difficult to differentiate
between normal and reverse protonation states.

Possible protonation states of phosphite and His292 in PTDH. The
two substrates bind to the enzyme in an ordered mechanism with NAD+ binding first. On the basis of
the pH–rate profile, dianionic phosphite could bind to the
NAD+–PTDH complex containing a protonated His292
(blue). If this is the active complex, a residue other than His292
must function as a base to deprotonate the water nucleophile. Alternatively,
the pKa values of phosphite and the His
could be perturbed in the ternary complex such that a proton is transferred
from the protonated His to the phosphite to generate a monoprotonated
phosphite as the actual electrophile (red). This form of the ternary
complex could also be accessed if monoanionic phosphite binds to the
NAD+–PTDH complex in which the His is unprotonated
(reverse protonation based on their pKa values).

In this study, we identified putative PTDH orthologs
in the protein
databases and selected four members with diverse sequence identities
compared to PTDH from P. stutzeri WM88 for heterologous
expression and characterization. In addition, we used site-directed
mutagenesis to investigate the importance of the Arg301, Ser295, Tyr139,
and Trp134 residues.

Materials and Methods
Materials
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma or
Aldrich and used without further purification. Methylobacterium
extorquens AM1, Nostoc sp. 7120, and Ralstonia metallidurans CH34 were obtained from ATCC. Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 was provided by J. Meeks (University
of California, Davis, CA). The 16 total mutations in TS-PTDH compared
to wt-PTDH from P. stutzeri are D13E, M26I, V71I,
E130K, Q132R, Q137R, I150F, Q215L, R275Q, L276Q, I313L, V315A, A319E,
A325V, E332N, and C336D. The 17X mutant has one additional mutation
(E175A) that allows the protein to use both NAD+ and NADP;
it is this protein that is most versatile for cofactor regeneration.
In the crystal structure of 17X-PTDH, all mutated residues are distant
from the active site, with the exception of E175A, which disrupts
an interaction with the ribose group of NAD+ to allow NADP
to be used as a substrate ().

Methods
The concentrations of NAD+ stock
solutions were determined by the absorbance at 260 nm (ε = 18000
M–1 cm–1). The concentration of
stock solutions of phosphite was determined by running the PTDH reaction
to completion in the presence of excess NAD+. The maximal
absorbance at 340 nm was then measured, which represents the concentration
of NADH formed (ε = 6.2 mM–1 cm–1) and is equivalent to the concentration of phosphite consumed. Tris
buffer was made from Tris base and adjusted to the correct pH with
5 M HCl; MOPS and MES buffers were made by adjusting the pH using
5 M NaOH.

Cloning of ptxD Genes from Various Organisms
The following primer sets were used to amplify DNA encoding PTDHs
from whole cells of each of the following organisms: R. metallidurans (5′-GGCGCGCCCATATGAATCATCGGAAAATC-3′
and 5′-GGCGCGCCGGATCCCTATGCTGCCGCGCTGG-3′), N. punctiforme (5′-GGCGCGCCCATATGAAACCCAAAGTTGTAAT-3′ and 5′-GGCGCGCCGGATCCTTAACTTGGACAATTGATCG-3′), and Nostoc sp.
PCC 7120 (5′-GGCGCGCCCATATGAAACCAAAGGTTGTGAT-3′
and 5′-GGCGCGCCGGATCCTGTGTGGACAACGGCTAAAA-3′). Each primer set was designed to
incorporate restriction sites (underlined above) such that NdeI is part of the start codon and BamHI or BglII is downstream of the gene. Each PCR
product was digested with NdeI and BamHI or BglII and ligated into NdeI- and BamHI/BglII-digested pET11a
(Novagen, Inc.) to obtain the circularized plasmid. The gene from M. extorquens was amplified from genomic DNA using the following
primers: 5′-GCCAGTTCCATATGAGAGCCAAGG-3′
and 5′-CTCACACTCGAGTCACGGATGTCG-3′.
The primers contain NdeI and XhoI restriction sites (underlined), which were used to incorporate
the gene into pET28a.

Overexpression and Purification of PTDH Orthologs
Strains
of Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET11a
vectors containing each ptxD insert were grown in
LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin. When the OD600 reached 0.6, cells were induced by addition of IPTG to
a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated at 25 °C for 15 h.
Cells were pelleted and processed using the method described in ref (). Extracts were loaded onto
a NAD+ affinity column using FPLC (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
The affinity resin was generated by attaching N6-[(6-aminohexyl)carbamoylmethyl]-NAD to a CNBr-activated Sepharose
4 Fast Flow matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The NAD+ derivative (125 g) was dissolved in 5 mL of a coupling solution
[0.1 M NaHCO3 and 0.5 M NaCl (pH 8.3)] and then bound to
4 g of matrix following the manufacturer’s coupling instructions.
The cell extract slurry was added to ∼15 mL of swollen NAD+ resin and packed in an XK 16/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) to create a final column volume of ∼28 mL. Unbound
protein was washed off with 10 column volumes (CV) of buffer C [20
mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.25), 10% glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol].
Protein was eluted by washing with 5 CV of 5 mM NAD+ in
buffer C. Fractions with the highest purity, as determined by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
were pooled; excess NAD+ was removed by centrifugal filtration
and then concentrated to at least 2 mg/mL protein [Amicon membrane,
30000 molecular weight cutoff (Millipore)]. Protein was stored at
−80 °C. Each protein ran at ∼35 kDa as determined
by SDS–PAGE, which is consistent with the size of each subunit
in the homodimer, and was highly pure (&gt;95%) when analyzed by SDS–PAGE.
The ortholog from M. extorquens AM1 contained a His6 affinity tag and was purified by the method used for mutants
of 17X-PTDH, as discussed below.

Preparation of 17X-PTDH Mutant Constructs
All mutants
were generated in the 17X-PTDH background using the pRW2 plasmid unless noted otherwise [note that this enzyme
is called 12X in ref () but actually contains 17 mutations (see above)]. The mutants were
prepared by PCR using QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent). The following
primers were used to incorporate the mutations (along with their reverse
complement strands, which are not listed): R301A, 5′-GTG CGC
GCG GTG GCG CTG GAG ATT GAA C-3′; R301K,
5′-GTG CGC GCG GTG AAA CTG GAG ATT GAA
C-3′; S295A, 5′-CCG CAC ATA GGG GCG GCA GTG CGC GCG-3′; Y139F, 5′-C TGG CAA CCA CGG TTC TTC GGC ACG GG-3′; W134F, 5′-GC AAG TTC
CGG GGC TTC CAA CCA CGG TTC TAC-3′;
W134A, 5′-GC AAG TTC CGG GGC GCG CAA
CCA CGG TTC TAC-3′. The mutated codon is underlined in each
case. Once the mutant genes were constructed, they were sequenced
in their entirety to ensure that the desired mutation was incorporated
and no other mutations were generated.

Overexpression and Purification of PTDH Mutants
To
obtain mutants of 17X-PTDH, we transformed chemically competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with plasmids containing the desired
gene in vector pRW2 and plated them on a LB agar plate containing
100 μg/mL ampicillin. A single colony was picked and used to
inoculate an overnight culture (50 mL). The cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in 1 L of LB/ampicillin, and grown at
37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6. IPTG was added to the culture
(final concentration of 0.3 mM), which was incubated at 18 °C
for 16–20 h. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (8000g for 30 min), resuspended in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 M
NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, and stored at −80 °C. The
resuspended pellet was then thawed on ice and lysed using an Avestin
Emulsiflex-C3 homogenizer (15000 psi, six passes). The insoluble lysate
was removed by centrifugation (15000g for 30 min),
and the soluble lysate was passed through a 0.44 μm filter.
The enzyme was purified via FPLC (Äkta) by immobilized metal
affinity chromatography with a HisTrap HP Ni2+ affinity
column (GE Life Sciences). The column was washed with 5 CV of buffer
A, followed by a gradient to 40% buffer B over 5 CV and another gradient
of 2 CV to 100% buffer B [buffer A consisted of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6),
100 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 10% (v/v) glycerol; buffer B consisted
of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, and 10% (v/v)
glycerol]. Fractions containing 17X-PTDH mutants were identified by
an activity assay and analyzed by SDS–PAGE. The fractions that
showed only PTDH by SDS–PAGE were pooled and concentrated using
centrifugal filtration [Amicon membrane, 30000 molecular weight cutoff
(Millipore)], followed by buffer exchange or dialysis to 20 mM MOPS
(pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, and 10% glycerol. The protein purity was &gt;95%
on the basis of FPLC analysis and SDS–PAGE analysis. Specific
activities for several independent purifications of each mutant were
found to be comparable, further suggesting that the enzyme was highly
pure. The kcat values listed in Table  are the average of three independently purified
protein batches. The protein solution was then flash-frozen and stored
at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined in triplicate
using the calculated extinction coefficient for 17X-PTDH (28000 M–1 cm–1). For Trp134 mutants, the extinction coefficient was calculated to
be 21000 M–1 cm–1 (ExPASy ProtParam
tool). For comparison, protein concentrations for a stock solution
of 17X-PTDH were also determined by the method of Bradford, using Coomassie Plus reagent (Thermo Scientific)
and bovine serum albumin (BSA) to generate a standard curve. Measurements
were taken at 595 nm and compared to the standard curve to determine
protein concentrations, using the calculated molar mass of 17X-PTDH.
Experimental measurements were taken in triplicate in each case. Concentrations
of 22.4 ± 1.3 and 22.7 ± 0.1 μM were determined by
absorbance at A280 using the calculated
extinction coefficient and the Bradford method, respectively. The
concentrations determined by each method were within experimental
error of one another.

Steady State Kinetic Assays
Initial rates were determined
using a Cary 4000 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Varian) to monitor
the rate of formation of NADH using its absorbance at 340 nm (ε
= 6.2 mM–1 cm–1). Typical reactions
were performed in 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.25). For 17X-PTDH, R301K, and
R301A, a full set of kinetic data was collected varying both the phosphite
and NAD+ concentrations (Figure S2 of the ). For 17X-PTDH, substrate concentrations
of 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, 0.20, and 0.50 mM were used, with 0.0910
± 0.0004 μM enzyme. For R301K, NAD+ concentrations
of 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50, and 1.0 mM and phosphite concentrations
of 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 mM were used, with 0.126 ±
0.001 μM enzyme. For R301A, NAD+ concentrations of
0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 mM and phosphite concentrations of
9.0, 18, 45, 90, 181, and 271 mM were used, with 4.976 ± 0.022
μM enzyme. For the other mutants, NAD+ was held at
a saturating concentration of 4 mM (&gt;16Km,NAD) while the phosphite concentration was varied, or NAD+ concentrations were varied while phosphite was held at a saturating
concentration of 2.2 mM for S295A (21Km,PT), 9.0 mM for W134F (26Km,PT), 46.5 mM
for W134A (24Km,PT), and 5.0 mM for Y139F
(128Km,PT). Enzyme concentrations were
0.259 ± 0.001 μM for S295A, 0.147 ± 0.001 μM
for Y139F, 0.233 ± 0.001 μM for W134A, and 0.215 ±
0.001 μM for W134F. Errors in kcat were obtained from three independently purified batches of protein.

For the kinetic assays, reaction mixtures were allowed to equilibrate
at 25 °C in a controlled temperature block, which was verified
using a thermocouple inserted into the cuvette, and the reaction was
initiated by addition of enzyme. Assays on the 17X-PTDH mutants were
performed with the His6 affinity tag attached. The His
tag has been shown not to have a significant effect on the kinetic
parameters of the enzyme in a previous study. Assays for PTDH orthologs were performed at 30 °C. Initial
rates were obtained over the course of 1 min. The data were fit to
the Michaelis–Menten equation using OriginPro 8 (OriginLab)
for the orthologs and the mutants of Ser295, Trp134, and Tyr139 or
using the equation for an ordered, sequential, two-substrate mechanism
(eq ) using GraFit
7 for 17X-PTDH, R301A, and R301K.In this equation A represents the first substrate
to bind (NAD+) and B represents the second substrate (phosphite). KA and KB are Km,NAD and Km,PT,
respectively. Kia represents the dissociation
constant for NAD+.

Kinetic Isotope Effects
Deuterium-labeled phosphite
(D-PT) was prepared as reported previously by mixing phosphorous acid with deuterium oxide at 50 °C for
6 h. The solution was then concentrated with a rotary evaporator and
the residue redissolved in deuterium oxide. This procedure was repeated
until only deuterium-labeled phosphorous acid was observed by 31P NMR spectroscopy (500 MHz Varian, H3PO4 used as an external reference, δ = 0 ppm): δ 3.71 (t, JP–D = 88 Hz). The solution was then neutralized
using aqueous NaOH and lyophilized to obtain solid deuterium-labeled
sodium phosphite. We determined kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) by
holding NAD+ at saturating conditions (&gt;10Km) and obtaining initial rates with varying concentrations
of either deuterated or protiated phosphite.

pH–Rate Profiles of 17X-PTDH Mutants
Solutions
containing 100 mM Tris, 50 mM MES, and 50 mM acetic acid, generating
a universal buffer with a constant ionic strength, were prepared at pH 5.5, 5.8, 6.1, 6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.3,
7.6, 7.9, 8.2, 8.5, 8.8, and 9.0. NAD+ was dissolved in
a buffer with the desired pH, and phosphite stock solutions were adjusted
to the pH of the assay. Experiments were also performed in 100 mM
Tris-maleate, a broad range buffer, as well as in 100 mM MOPS from
pH 6.7 to 7.7. NAD+ was held at saturating conditions (&gt;10Km), whereas phosphite concentrations were varied
from 0.05 to 1500 mM (for 17X-PTDH-R301A), from 0.5 to 500 mM (for
17X-PTDH-R301K), and from 0.15 to 50 mM (for 17X-PTDH). The concentrations
of phosphite used at each pH were varied according to the Km,PT at that
pH, ranging from approximately 0.2Km to
&gt;10Km,PT. The samples were mixed and
allowed
to equilibrate for several minutes to adjust the temperature and ensure
homogeneity until the baseline absorbance at 340 nm remained constant.
Reactions were initiated by addition of 17X-PTDH (final concentration
of 0.16 μM), 17X-PTDH-R301K (final concentration of 0.08 μM),
or 17X-PTDH-R301A (final concentration of 3–6 μM). Initial
rates of NADH formation were monitored at 340 nm using a Cary 4000
spectrophotometer. Kinetic parameters were determined from fits to
the Michaelis–Menten equation using OriginPro 8, and pKa values were determined by fitting logarithmic
plots of kcat and kcat/Km to the equation for curves
with one or two proton transitions (eqs  and , respectively), with K1, K2, and (kcat/Km)0 representing dependent variables that are calculated
by fitting of the data. K1 represents
the acid dissociation constant for a proton transition that increases
activity upon deprotonation (ascending limb), and K2 represents the acid dissociation constant for a proton
transition that decreases activity upon deprotonation (descending
limb); (kcat/K)0 is a pH-independent value.

Gel Filtration Experiments
Gel filtration experiments
were performed on a BioSil SEC-250 (Bio-Rad) HPLC gel filtration column
using a buffer that consisted of 100 mM MOPS (pH 7.3) and 0.4 M sodium
phosphite. Albumin, alcohol dehydrogenase, β-amylase, blue dextran,
carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c standards (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used to generate a standard curve. 17X-PTDH-R301A and 17X-PTDH
were run on the column with and without 5 mM NAD+. The
elution time compared to that of the standards was used to determine
the oligomerization states of the proteins.

Results
Identification of PTDH Orthologs
Several uncharacterized
proteins from different bacteria were selected to test for PTDH activity
based on their level of sequence identity (44–56%) to wt-PTDH
from P. stutzeri (Table S1 of the ). These proteins were heterologously
expressed in E. coli, purified by NAD+ affinity chromatography, and assayed for PTDH activity with phosphite
and NAD+ (Table ). NADH formation
was observed spectrophotometrically, and phosphate production was
verified with a malachite green assay. The kinetic parameters of each protein were comparable to those
of PTDH from P. stutzeri.

His6 tag, whereas the other enzymes did not.

Sequence Analysis of PTDH Orthologs
Residues Arg237,
Glu266, and His292 are highly conserved among the DHDH family and
have been shown to be important for catalysis in PTDH., With more than one PTDH now identified experimentally, a sequence
alignment was performed to determine if any other residues are conserved
among this enzyme family. On the basis of this alignment, Arg301,
Ser295, Tyr139, and Trp134 were found to be highly conserved among
these enzymes but not among members of the DHDH family (Figure S3
of the ). Furthermore,
all four residues are near the phosphite binding site (Figure ). Several other conserved residues were observed,
but in the crystal structure of PTDH, these residues are distant from
the enzyme active site. To investigate the importance of Arg301, Ser295,
Tyr139, and Trp134 for catalysis, we performed site-directed mutagenesis
to generate the following mutants, all in the 17X-PTDH background:
Arg301Lys, Arg301Ala, Ser295Ala, Tyr139Phe, Trp134Phe, and Trp134Ala.
All mutants were successfully expressed in E. coli as N-terminally His6-tagged fusion proteins and purified
by immobilized Ni2+ affinity chromatography.

PTDH Steady State Assays
Steady state kinetic assays
were used to determine the effect of each mutation on enzyme activity
(Table ).
Overall, the values of kcat for all mutants
except Arg301Ala are very similar to that of the parent PTDH. The kcat of the Arg301Ala mutant was reduced ∼100-fold,
but the kcat of the Arg301Lys mutant was
actually slightly increased compared to that of 17X-PTDH. Km,PT was greatly increased for both Arg301 mutants,
with a particularly large increase (∼700-fold) for Arg301Ala. Km,NAD was also increased 10-fold for the R301A
mutant, with a more modest increase (3-fold) for R301K. Use of a full
matrix of varying phosphite and NAD+ concentrations allowed
determination of the dissociation constant for NAD, Kia,NAD, using the equation for an ordered, sequential mechanism in which NAD+ binds
prior to phosphite. Arg301 mutations did
not substantially increase Kia,NAD (Table ), which is perhaps not unexpected given the large
distance between Arg301 and the cofactor in the crystal structure
(). In the X-ray structure,
Arg301 participates in the dimer interface for 17X-PTDH. To ensure
that the data obtained with the Arg301Ala mutant were not a consequence
of disruption of the oligomerization state of the protein, gel filtration
experiments were performed, which showed that the Arg301Ala mutant
remains a dimer.

The Ser295Ala, Trp134Phe, Trp134Ala, and Tyr139Phe
mutants had only slightly reduced kcat values compared to that of 17X-PTDH, suggesting that these residues
do not play an important role in catalysis. Trp134 mutations did affect
the Km values for phosphite, with the
Trp134Ala mutant exhibiting a 40-fold increase in Km,PT. The Trp134Phe mutant had a similar effect on Km,PT, although it was smaller in magnitude.
Kinetic isotope effect (KIE) experiments performed with selected mutants
yielded normal Dkcat and Dkcat/Km,PT values, which were similar in magnitude to those observed with 17X-PTDH.
These results suggest that hydride transfer remains rate-limiting
at pH 7.25, as has been previously shown for wt-PTDH and a series
of mutants with a wide range of catalytic activities.

All assays were performed at 25
°C and pH 7.25 in 100 mM MOPS. kcat values were obtained for three batches of each enzyme, and the average
is presented here (see ).

We determined the values
by varying
the concentrations of both substrates, determining the initial rates,
and fitting all data to the equation shown in .

We determined
the values by holding
one substrate at a saturating concentration and varying the concentration
of the other substrate. Initial rates were fit to the Michaelis–Menten
equation. The errors given in parentheses were obtained from the fits
of the experimental data to the respective equations (see ).

pH–Rate Profiles of 17X-PTDH Mutants
The pH
dependence of the steady state kinetic constants was determined for
17X-PTDH-R301A and 17X-PTDH-R301K, the mutants with the most interesting
phenotypes. Like that of wt-PTDH, the pH–rate profile for 17X-PTDH
is pH-independent for log(kcat) (Figure A) and displays a bell-shaped curve for log(kcat/Km) (Figure B) with extracted pKa values of 6.53 ± 0.10 and 7.90 ± 0.08 from a fit to the
appropriate equation (see ). The pH–rate profile for R301K was overall similar to that
of 17X-PTDH. The log(kcat) profile is
pH-independent in the pH range of 7–9, but it appears that
a deprotonation event with a pKa of 5.93
± 0.03 may affect kcat. This pKa is close to the limits of the pH range in
which this mutant is stable (Figure C), and
we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the observed decrease
in activity may be the result of a loss of activity that is not associated
with a defined ionizable residue. The mutant displays a bell-shaped
curve for log(kcat/Km), with extracted pKa values of
6.62 ± 0.05 and 8.37 ± 0.07 for the two proton transitions
(Figure D).

(C and D, respectively), and 17X-PTDH-R301A (E and F, respectively).
When error bars are not visible, they were smaller than the font size
used for the data point.

In contrast to the plots of kcat/Km and kcat of R301K,
the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters of R301A was very different.
The plot of log(kcat) versus pH was nearly
linear with a slope of 0.6 (Figure E) and
may suggest specific base catalysis by hydroxide (for further discussion,
see the ). In contrast,
log(kcat/Km) was essentially pH-independent (Figure F). This latter finding is the result of offsetting effects on kcat and Km,PT (Table
S3 of the ). The
former increases with pH, resulting in improved catalysis, but the
latter also increases with pH, resulting in less efficient catalysis
at low substrate concentrations. The same findings were obtained in
three different buffer systems: a universal buffer with a constant
ionic strength, a broad-range Tris-maleate
buffer, and MOPS, the standard PTDH assay buffer. The data in Figure  were obtained in the universal buffer.

Discussion
The rapid increase in the number of available
protein sequences
suggests that a substantial branch of the DHDH family is likely composed
of phosphite dehydrogenases (Figure S4 of the ). Four of these enzymes were shown
here to catalyze phosphite oxidation to complement the previously
characterized enzymes from P. stutzeri() and Alcaligenes faecalis. Another phosphite dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas sp. K was reported while this paper was under review. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of these
enzymes illustrates that they all have similar kcat values despite a high degree of sequence diversity (39–72%
pairwise identity). The reaction catalyzed by PTDHs has a very strong
thermodynamic driving force, and it has been suggested that perhaps
the rather moderate values of kcat were
the result of a “young” enzyme that had relatively recently
evolved from a progenitor in the DHDH family. The strong sequence diversity demonstrated here suggests that instead
phosphite oxidation is likely an old activity, and the very similar
catalytic parameters, combined with the inability to increase kcat substantially by directed evolution, suggest that the rates of oxidation of phosphite
by PTDHs may be limited by a relatively high intrinsic barrier.

With the recently determined crystal structure of TS-PTDH () and the availability of sequences
of additional PTDH orthologs with moderate sequence homology to the
enzyme from P. stutzeri, several previously unidentified
conserved residues near the active site were revealed. These amino
acids include Ser295, Tyr139, Trp134, and Arg301, none of which are
conserved in the DHDH family. Our mutagenesis studies do not support
important roles for Ser295, Tyr139, and Trp134 in catalysis because
relatively conservative mutations at these positions that removed
functional groups (S295A, Y139F, and W134F) did not much alter kcat. The conservative mutants of Trp134 and
Ser295 did result in an increase in the Km values of the substrates (4–10-fold), suggesting that these
residues do play roles in optimizing catalytic efficiency, perhaps
by helping position Arg301 to which they are hydrogen bonded in the
wt enzyme.

The phenotypes of the mutants of Arg301 were more
interesting.
In the X-ray structure of the ternary complex with the competitive
inhibitor sulfite (),
Arg301 is hydrogen bonded to a water molecule that in turn is hydrogen
bonded to sulfite. Its side chain is in a position within the PTDH
active site that could be interpreted as Arg301 potentially acting
as a catalytic base to deprotonate a water nucleophile. Arginine is
not commonly considered in the acid–base chemistry of proteins
because of its relatively high solution phase pKa, but several recent reports have documented enzymes in which
arginine has been proposed to act as a base.− The Arg301Ala mutation of 17X-PTDH resulted in an approximately
100-fold reduced kcat and a greatly increased Km,PT, demonstrating that Arg301 indeed plays
an important catalytic role. The magnitude of the reduction in the kcat of the Arg301Ala mutant and the observation
that the Arg301Lys mutant retained a kcat comparable to that of 17X-PTDH are similar to the findings with
mutants of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase for which a role of
an Arg as active site base to deprotonate a water molecule has been
proposed.−,, However, the observed phenotype of the Arg301Ala mutant may also
be attributed to removal of an important electrostatic effect. Indeed,
the large changes in the Km values for
both substrates as well as the drastically different pH dependence
of both kcat and kcat/Km,PT suggest that this mutant
is severely disrupted compared to the parent protein and that its
mechanism of catalysis may not be representative of the parent enzyme.
Because we have no direct experimental evidence that Arg is acting
as a base, we prefer a model of Arg301 providing electrostatic activation
for the nucleophilic attack of water/hydroxide on phosphite.

An electrostatic role of Arg301 appears to be supported by the
data obtained for 17X-PTDH-R301K. This mutant shows a more modest
increase in Km,PT and has a slightly improved kcat compared to those of 17X-PTDH. Furthermore,
the pH–rate profiles are very similar, the only substantial
change being a shift of the basic pKa in
the bell-shaped curve for log(kcat/Km,PT) to a higher value (from 7.9 to 8.4). If
this pKa indeed represents His292, its
pKa could be increased because of a weaker
electrostatic destabilization of the imidazolium group of His292 by
a protonated Lys than by a protonated Arg. Collectively, the steady
state kinetic parameters and the pH–rate profiles suggest that
lysine is capable of playing a catalytic role similar to that of arginine,
and these observations are more readily explained by an electrostatic
interaction than by a role as a base. These positively charged residues
may also be important for orienting the phosphite substrate for efficient
catalysis.

In summary, the simplest explanation of the data
in this and previous
studies is that His292 is associated with the basic limb and phosphite
with the acidic limb of the pH–rate profile for kcat/Km,PT. Whether His292
is unprotonated and phosphite monoprotonated in the binding step,
or whether dianionic phosphite binds to PTDH with a protonated His292
is currently not known, but either possibility suggests that the nucleophilic
displacement reaction takes place on monoprotonated phosphite. The
fully conserved Arg301 that is near the phosphite binding site in
the X-ray structure appears to play an electrostatic role in catalysis
given the very minor perturbations observed in the R301K mutant.
