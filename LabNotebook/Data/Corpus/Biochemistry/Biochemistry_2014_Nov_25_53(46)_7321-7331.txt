This study examines metal binding
to metallo-β-lactamase
VIM-2, demonstrating the first successful preparation of a Co(II)-substituted
VIM-2 analogue. Spectroscopic studies of the half- and fully metal
loaded enzymes show that both Zn(II) and Co(II) bind cooperatively,
where the major species present, regardless of stoichiometry, are
apo- and di-Zn (or di-Co) enzymes. We determined the di-Zn VIM-2 structure
to a resolution of 1.55 Å, and this structure supports results
from spectroscopic studies. Kinetics, both steady-state and pre-steady-state,
show that VIM-2 utilizes a mechanism that proceeds through a very
short-lived anionic intermediate when chromacef is used as the substrate.
Comparison with other B1 enzymes shows that those that bind Zn(II)
cooperatively are better poised to protonate the intermediate on its
formation, compared to those that bind Zn(II) non-cooperatively, which
uniformly build up substantial amounts of the intermediate.

According to the 2013 Antibiotic
Resistance Threat Report, more than 2 million people in the U.S. were
infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection, and more
than 23,000 of these patients died.1 During
the past decade, the incidence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella pneumoniae has increased, and death rates associated with metallo-β-lactamase
(MBL) producers range from 18 to 67%.2 MBL-producing
bacteria that exhibited carbapenemase activity were first reported
in 1990.3 Since then the emergence of VIM-,
IMP-, and NDM-type MBLs has been reported in many countries.2 The activities of these MBLs are not inhibited
by clavulanic acid or any other commercially available β-lactamase
inhibitors.4 The IMiPenamase (IMP), Verona
integrin-encoded (VIM), and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)
enzymes are the most clinically significant MBLs because they (and
their derivatives) appear in bacterial strains that exhibit high mortality
rates.2 All three MBLs belong to the B1
subclass.5 IMP was first identified in
the early 1990s in strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens in Japan,3,6 and currently includes 47 variants isolated in countries across
the globe, on every continent except Africa and Antarctica.7,8 So far, 12 variants of NDM MBL have been isolated from 40 countries
worldwide except Antarctica.8,9

VIM was first
identified in a patient in Italy who was infected
with P. aeruginosa.10,11 To date, 39
variants of VIM have been identified,8 and
these variants exhibit 74.3–99.6% sequence similarity.12,13 Among these VIM variants, VIM-2 appears to be the one most commonly
found in the clinic, and VIM-2-expressing bacterial strains have been
found in many countries.14−23 IMP-1 and NDM-1 have been extensively studied biochemically, crystallographically,
and spectroscopically.24−27 In contrast, while there are nine crystal structures of VIM variants
available, including two of VIM-2 at 1.9 and 2.2 Å resolution,28,29 presently detailed kinetic/mechanistic or spectroscopic studies
reported on any variant of VIM are not available. To address this
deficit, we have investigated the kinetic mechanism of VIM-2 using
stopped-flow kinetics. To further probe the structure of the VIM-2
active site, X-ray crystallographic and X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) spectroscopic studies were performed on the native Zn(II)-containing
enzyme. Co(II)-substituted VIM-2 was also prepared and characterized
using UV–vis, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and EXAFS
spectroscopies. Results of these studies offer insights into metal
binding by VIM-2, elucidate emerging patterns in reactivity that track
with metal-binding properties, and add to the current efforts in medicinal
chemistry to design clinical inhibitors of this class.

Experimental
Procedures
Materials
pET24a vector was used to
clone blaVIM-2, which was initially isolated from
a clinical strain of P. aeruginosa.30Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen)
were used for protein overexpression. Lysogeny broth (LB) medium was
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), and minimal medium was prepared
according to a previously described procedure.31 Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was
purchased from Gold Biotechnology (St. Louis, MO). Q-Sepharose (GE
Healthcare) anion-exchange and Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration (Amersham
Biosciences AB, Uppasala, Sweden) columns were used to purify recombinant
VIM-2. Purified protein solutions were pooled and concentrated with
an ultrafiltration cell equipped with YM-10 DIAFLO membranes from
Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Steady-state kinetics and pre-steady-state
kinetics studies were conducted using chromacef (Sopharmia, Inc.,
St. Joseph, MO).26

Overexpression and Purification
of VIM-2 in LB and Minimal Media
Plasmid pet24a-VIM-2 was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells,
and the cell mixture was plated on LB-agar
plates containing 25 μg/mL kanamycin. A single colony was transferred
into 50 mL of LB containing 25 μg/mL kanamycin, and the culture
was allowed to shake overnight at 37 °C. Ten milliters of the
overnight culture was used to inoculate 4 × 1 L of LB containing
25 μg/mL kanamycin, and the cultures were shaken at 200 rpm
and 37 °C to an OD600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Protein
production was induced by making the cultures 0.5 mM in IPTG. The
resulting cultures were allowed to shake for 3 h at 37 °C, and
the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 7000 rpm
and 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 30 mL of 30 mM
Tris, pH 7.6, containing 500 mM NaCl. The cells were lysed by passing
the suspension three times through a French press at a pressure of
1000 psi. The mixture containing the lysed cells was centrifuged for
25 min at 15 000 rpm at 4 °C to remove insoluble components.
The cleared solution was dialyzed versus 2 L of 30 mM Tris, pH 7.6,
overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 25 min at 15 000
rpm, the cleared solution was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.5
cm × 20 cm with a 28 mL bed volume). Bound proteins were eluted
with a linear gradient of 0–500 mM NaCl in 30 mM Tris, pH 7.6.

Fractions containing VIM-2 were identified using SDS-PAGE, pooled,
and then concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration concentrator
equipped with a YM-10 membrane. The concentrated protein solution
(ca. 3 mL) was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column
(1.5 cm × 40 cm, bed volume of 60 mL), using 30 mM Tris, pH 7.6,
containing 100 mM NaCl as the running buffer. The concentration of
VIM-2 was determined using an extinction coefficient of 28 500
M–1 cm–1 at 280 nm.32 As-isolated enzyme contained 0.4 equiv of Zn(II).
To prepare more fully load Zn(II) analogues of VIM-2, 0.6 or 1.6 equiv
of Zn(II) was added to purified VIM-2, and the resulting solutions
were dialyzed versus 2 L of Chelex-treated 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, for
16 h.

VIM-2 was also overexpressed in minimal medium as previously
described.31,33 The protein was purified as described
above, except that Chelex-treated
50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, was used as the buffer during the chromatography
steps. One milliliter of 100 mM CoCl2 was added to each
1 L flask at the time of induction.

Preparation of Co(II)-Substituted
VIM-2
Metal analyses
of purified VIM-2, which was overexpressed in minimal medium, revealed
that the protein binds 0.5 equiv of Co(II) and less than 0.1 equiv
of Zn(II). Co(II)-containing VIM-2 was concentrated to 1 mM using
an Amicon concentrator equipped with a YM-10 membrane. Concentrated
Co(II)-containing VIM-2 was centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10
min to remove any precipitated protein. CoCl2 solution
(0.5 or 1.5 equiv) was added, and the mixtures were incubated on the
ice for 20 min. The resulting solutions were dialyzed versus 2 L of
Chelex-treated 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, for 16 h, and the resulting enzyme
was pink and remained pink for several months at 4 °C. UV–vis
spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5480A UV–vis spectrophotometer,
at 25 °C. Difference spectra were generated by subtracting the
spectrum of VIM-2 isolated from LB medium from the spectrum of Co(II)-substituted
VIM-2.

Metal Analyses
The metal content of the VIM-2 samples
was determined using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 7300V inductively coupled
plasma spectrometer with optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).
Protein samples were diluted to 1–3 μM with 50 mM Hepes,
pH 6.8 or 7.6. Calibration curves were generated using serial dilutions
of Fisher metal standards (Zn, Co, Fe, and Cu) ranging from 1.0 to
8.0 μM. Emission lines at 202.548, 228.616, 238.196, and 327.394
nm were chosen to ensure the lowest possible detection limits for
zinc, cobalt, iron, and copper, respectively.

Steady-State Kinetics
Steady-state kinetic studies
were conducted on a Hewlett-Packard 5480A UV–vis spectrophotometer
at 25 °C. The hydrolysis of chromacef was monitored by formation
of the hydrolyzed product at 442 nm, and absorbance data were converted
to concentration data using an extinction coefficient of 18 600
M–1 cm–1.26 The buffer used for the steady-state kinetic studies was 50 mM cacodylate,
pH 7.0, and substrate concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μM
were used in these studies. Rate vs substrate concentration curves
were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten equation using Igor-Pro
to determine KM and Vmax.

Pre-Steady-State Kinetics
Stopped-flow
UV–vis
studies were conducted using an Applied Photophysics SX 20 stopped-flow
spectrophotometer, equipped with a photodiode array detector. Reactions
of VIM-2 with chromacef were thermostated at 22 °C, and Chelex-treated,
50 mM cacodylate, pH 7.0, was used as the buffer. Reaction progress
curves were generated by converting the absorbance data to concentration
data using the following extinction coefficients: substrate ε378 = 22 000 M–1 cm–1, product ε442 = 18 600 M–1 cm–1, and intermediate ε620 =
22 000 M–1 cm–1.26 Simulated progress curves were generated using
a previously described MATLAB script,24 derived for the reaction mechanisms shown in Scheme 1. Theoretical kcat and Km values were calculated using the King–Altman
method,34 assuming k2 or k3 as the rate-limiting step.26

Scheme 1 Crystallization and X-ray
Diffraction Data Collection
Crystallization trials were prepared
in 96-well sitting drop Intelliplate
vapor diffusion plates (Art Robbins Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). The
1.0 μL sitting drops consisted of a 1:1 ratio of 10 mg/mL VIM-2
and reservoir solution. Initial screening was carried out using the
sparse matrix crystallization screens MCSG 1–4 (Microlytic,
Burlington, MA). Optimization of initial hits from the sparse matrix
screens identified a reservoir solution of 0.2 M ammonium acetate,
100 μM zinc chloride, 0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.5, and 25% PEG 3350.
Crystals of VIM-2 were cryoprotected by brief transfer through LV
CryoOil (MiTeGen) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction
data were collected at 1.0000 Å for a single VIM-2 crystal on
beamline 4.2.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory.

Phases were calculated by molecular replacement
using the PHASER35 component of PHENIX36 utilizing the structure of zinc-bound VIM-229 (PDB accession code 1KO3) as the search model. The molecular replacement
solution was subjected to iterative rounds of model building in Coot37 and refinement in PHENIX.36 All molecular structure figures were prepared with PyMOL.38 Atomic coordinates and structure factors have
been deposited in the PDB (accession code 4NQ2). Stereochemical and geometric analyses
of the VIM-2 structure were conducted with MolProbity version 4.02b.39

EXAFS Spectroscopy
Samples for EXAFS
(protein concentrations
of approximately 1.5 mM) were prepared with 20% (v/v) glycerol as
a glassing agent. Samples were loaded in Lucite cuvettes with 6 μm
polypropylene windows and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen. Data
were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), beamline
X3B, equipped with a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. Harmonic
rejection was accomplished using a Ni focusing mirror. Fluorescence
excitation spectra for all samples were measured with a 31-element
solid-state Ge detector array. Samples were held at approximately
15 K in a Displex cryostat. EXAFS data collection and reduction were
performed according to published procedures.40 Data were measured in duplicate, six scans for zinc and eight scans
for cobalt each on two samples from independent purifications; fits
to the two data sets were equivalent. As both data sets gave similar
results, the data were averaged using EXAFSPAK (EXAFSPAK is available
free of charge from http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html); the experimental spectra presented here are the averaged data
sets (12 or 16 scans per sample). The data were converted from energy
to k-space using E0 = 9680 eV for Zn and E0 = 7730 eV for Co.

Fourier-filtered EXAFS
data were fitted using the nonlinear least-squares engine of IFEFFIT,
which is distributed with SixPack (SixPack is available free of charge
from http://www-ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/∼swebb/sixpack.htm; IFEFFIT is open source software available from http://cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit/Ifeffit). Theoretical amplitude and phase functions were calculated with
FEFF v. 8.00.41 Zinc–nitrogen single-scattering
and zinc–imidazole multiple-scattering were calibrated to the
experimental EXAFS of zinc tetrakis-1-methylimidazole Zn(II) perchlorate,
[Zn(MeIm)4][ClO4]2. Zinc–sulfur
scattering was calibrated to the experimental EXAFS spectrum of tetrabutylammonium
zinc tetramesitylthiolate, [Bu4N]2[Zn(Smes)4]. Optimum scale factors (Sc)
and ΔE0 were derived from fits to
the model data (Sc = 0.78 (Zn–N)
or 0.91 (Zn–S); ΔE0 = −21
eV), and they were held fixed at these values for fits to metalloprotein
data. The models used for the calibration of cobalt–nitrogen
(and cobalt–imidazole) and cobalt–sulfur scattering
were hexakis-imidazole cobalt(II) perchlorate, [Co(Im)6][ClO4]2, and tetrabutylammonium
cobalt(II) tetramesitylthiolate, [Bu4N]2[Co(Smes)4], respectively. The resulting Sc and ΔE0 values (Sc = 0.79 (Co–N)
or 0.85 (Co–S); ΔE0 = −21
eV) were held fixed at these calibrated values in subsequent fits
to metalloprotein data. First-shell fits were then obtained for all
reasonable coordination numbers, including mixed nitrogen/oxygen/sulfur
ligation, while allowing the absorber–scatterer distance, Ras, and the Debye–Waller factor, σas2, to vary. Detailed summaries of the fitting
results are presented in Supporting Information. Multiple scattering contributions from histidine ligands were fitted
according to published procedures.40 Metal–metal
(zinc–zinc and cobalt–cobalt) scattering was modeled
with reference to the experimental EXAFS of Zn2 (salpn)2 and Co2 (salpn)2.

EPR Spectroscopy
Low-temperature EPR spectra were obtained
on a Bruker Elexsys EMX EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments
liquid helium flow cryostat. The spectra in Figure 6 were recorded at 9.64 (B0⊥B1) or 9.38 GHz (B0∥B1) using a Bruker DM4116 dual-mode cavity, with
10 G magnetic field modulation (100 kHz). Other parameters: time constant/conversion
time = 42 ms, receiver gain = 1 × 105, average of
four scans.

Results
Overexpression, Purification,
and Characterization of VIM-2
Recombinant VIM-2 was overexpressed
in LB medium and purified as
described above (referred to as “as-isolated (LB)” hereafter).
VIM-2 eluted from a Q-Sepharose column between 150 and 250 mM NaCl,
and the purity of the protein was shown to be &gt;90% by SDS-PAGE.
Gel
filtration chromatography further increased the purity to &gt;95%.
The
overall yield was 10 mg/L of LB growth medium. VIM-2 was also overexpressed
in minimal medium in the presence of Co(II) and purified as described
above (referred to as “as-isolated (MM)” hereafter).
The overall yield of VIM-2 after both columns was 5 mg/L of minimal
medium. The purified enzymes were shown to bind 0.4 ± 0.1 equiv
of Zn(II) (LB) or 0.5 ± 0.1 Co(II) (minimal medium), and &lt;0.1
equiv of any other metal ion. Metal analyses were not reported for
preceding VIM-2 preparations.14,30,32

Direct Addition of Zn(II) or Co(II) to As-Isolated VIM-2
To prepare VIM-2 analogues that contained one or two Zn(II) ions,
0.5 or 1.5 equiv of Zn(II) was added to as-isolated (LB) VIM-2, followed
by overnight dialysis against Chelex-treated 30 mM Tris, pH 7.6. ICP-OES
studies showed that the resulting enzymes bound 1.0 and 1.9 equiv
of Zn(II) (±0.1), respectively (referred to as “1Zn-VIM-2”
and “2Zn-VIM-2” hereafter). 1Zn-VIM-2 demostrated kcat = 10 ± 2 s–1 and Km = 9 ± 2 μM, compared to kcat = 22 ± 2 s–1 and Km = 8 ± 2 μM for 2Zn-VIM-2, when
using chromacef as substrate (Table 1). Similarly,
VIM-2 analogues containing one or two Co(II) ions were prepared by
adding 0.5 or 1.5 equiv of Co(II) to as-isolated (MM) VIM-2, followed
by overnight dialysis against 2 L of Chelex-treated 50 mM HEPES, pH
6.8 (a slightly acidic pH was seen to help prevent oxidation of Co(II)).
The resulting enzymes bound 0.8 and 1.8 equiv of Co(II), respectively
(referred to as “1Co-VIM-2” and “2Co-VIM-2”
hereafter). 1Co-VIM-2 exhibited kcat =
6 ± 1 s–1 and Km = 5 ± 2 μM, while 2Co-VIM-2 showed kcat = 10 ± 1 s–1 and Km = 6 ± 2 μM (Table 1). The kcat/Km values of the Co(II)-substituted enzymes were roughly equal to those
of the Zn(II)-containing analogues, with the 2Zn analogue clearly
the most efficient catalyst (Table 1).

Pre-Steady-State
Kinetics
To probe the kinetic mechanism
of VIM-2, stopped-flow kinetic studies were conducted. The reaction
of chromacef with 2Zn-VIM-2 (85 μM, Figure 1A) and 2Co-VIM-2 (125 μM, Figure 1B) was monitored over 500 ms using a stopped-flow mixer and diode-array
detection between 300 and 700 nm. Three distinct absorbance bands
were observed (378, 442, and 620 nm). The three bands correspond to
substrate decay, product formation, and intermediate formation/decay,
respectively.26 The resulting progress
curves were fitted to the kinetic mechanisms shown in Scheme 1, using the rate constants in Table 2.24 The use of the mechanism in
Scheme 1 resulted in good fits to the MATLAB
generated progress curves (Figure 1). The shapes
of the theoretical progress curves were greatly influenced by the
values of k2, k–2, and k3 and not significantly influenced
by other microscopic rate constants. We tested other mechanisms with
additional intermediates and with no intermediates; however, the use
of these mechanisms did not result in improved fits. The “dip”
in the substrate decay versus time data has been observed in the past
and has been attributed to overlapping absorbances of substrate and
product/intermediate.24,26,42−45

experimental progress curves are solid lines. The kinetic mechanism
in Scheme 1 and the rate constants in Table 2 were used to generate the theoretical progress
curves.

To determine
whether the kinetic mechanism (Scheme 1) and
rate constants in Table 2 correspond
to the steady-state experimental data, the King–Altman method
was used to determine equations for theoretical kcat and Km values. The theoretical kcat value for 2Zn-VIM-2 was 29 s–1, which nicely matches the experimental kcat = 22 s–1, and the theoretical Km value was 4.4 μM, within a factor of 2 of the
experimental Km = 8 μM. The theoretical kcat and Km values
for 2Co-VIM-2 were 35 s–1 and 2.1 μM, respectively,
within a factor of 3 of the experimental kcat and Km values (10 s–1 and 6 μM).

X-ray Crystal Structure of VIM-2
The X-ray crystal
structure of 2Zn-VIM-2 was determined to examine the active site structure
surrounding the bound Zn(II) atoms (Figure 2). Our structure is the highest resolution (1.55 Å) VIM-2 structure
determined to date29 and is of excellent
quality as judged by multiple validation parameters, including no
Cβ-deviations, a MolProbity clash score of 2.96 (99th percentile, N = 730, 1.550 ± 0.25 Å), and a MolProbity39 score of 1.21 (98th percentile, N = 6779, 1.550 ± 0.25 Å).

Figure 2 Active site from the VIM-2 crystal structure
(PDB ID: 4NQ2) reported here.
Zn1 is coordinated by three His and two water molecules,
and Zn2 is coordinated by one His, one Cys, one Asp, and
two water molecules. Zn1 and Zn2 are connected
by a hydroxyl bridge.

The overall structure of our recombinant VIM-2 (PDB ID: 4NQ2) is very similar
to those reported by Garcia-Saez et al. (PDB ID: 1KO3, reduced form) and
Yamaguchi et al. (PDB ID: 2YZ3, reduced form with bound phenylC3SH inhibitor),28,29 and to those of VIM-7 (PDB ID: 2Y87, reduced form)46 and VIM-31 (PDB ID: 4FR7). In the VIM-4 crystal structure there was a citrate
molecule bound in the active site, which results in an unusual six-coordinate
Zn2 ion, and the bridging water/hydroxide was replaced
by the citrate ion.47

Our structure
of VIM-2 showed the Zn(II) in the Zn1 site
bound to His114, His116, and His179, and the Zn(II) in the Zn2 site bound to Asp118, Cys198, and His240. In our structure,
three water molecules are found at 2.3–2.6 Å from the
Zn(II) atoms (Figure 2), while in the previous
structures, two water molecules are observed in the VIM-2 structure
(PDB ID: 1KO3) and one water molecule is observed in the VIM-2/inhibitor structures
(PDB ID: 2YZ3) (Figure 3). The present structure showed
a Zn–Zn internuclear distance of 3.46 Å (Table 3), which is similar to the value that we observed
by EXAFS (Table 4, below). Saez et al. (PDB
ID: 1KO3) and
Yamaguchi et al. (PDB ID: 2YZ3) reported different values for the metal–metal
(Zn(II)–Zn(II)) distance (4.20 and 3.75 Å, respectively)
in VIM-2.28,29 In our structure, a third Zn(II) binding
site is found, coordinated by His178 and two acetate ions from the
asymmetric unit and His285 from the symmetry mate found at −x + 1/2, −y + 1/2, z + 1/2. Given coordination by residues from two separate VIM-2 molecules,
the third Zn(II) binding site is likely a crystallographic artifact.
A similar Zn(II) site was reported in the Saez et al. structure.29

c Fitting results described in Supporting
Information, Tables S1–S6.

The best fit obtained for as-isolated VIM-2, containing
0.5 equiv
of Zn(II), indicates first-shell coordination to 4 N/O at 2.00 Å
and 0.5 S scatterers at 2.28 Å (Figure S1
and Table S1, compare fit S1-1 to S1-2). Multiple scattering
analyses indicate 2 imidazoles per Zn, while inclusion of a metal–metal
interaction at 3.36 Å improved the fit by 51% (Figure S1 and Table S1, compare fit S1-3 to S1-4). Best fit
results for 1Zn-VIM-2 are nearly indistinguishable, including a first
shell of 4 N/O and 0.5 S scatterers, 2 imidazoles per Zn, and a metal–metal
interaction at 3.37 Å. The metal–metal interaction improved
the fit by 23% (Figure S2 and Table S2,
compare fit S2-3 to S2-4). These results are consistent with VIM-2
containing ≤1 equiv of Zn(II) having both metal binding sites
partially occupied. Further, the substantial improvement in fit residual
on addition of the metal–metal vector suggests that metal binding
is cooperative, with the dominant species present at substoichiometric
metal loading being the apo- and dizinc enzymes.

EXAFS of 2Zn-VIM-2
is no different, with a first shell of 4 N/O
and 0.5 S, 2 imidazoles per Zn, and a metal–metal interaction
at 3.36 Å that improved the fit by nearly 27% (Figure S3 and Table S3, compare fit S3-3 to S3-4). These results
are clearly consistent with previous crystallographic studies28,29 and our own structure (Figure 2 and Table 3). The average coordination number of 4.5 and Zn–Zn
distance of 3.36 Å are in excellent agreement with our crystallographic
studies, which showed an average coordination number of 5 and a Zn–Zn
separation of 3.5 Å. The difference in coordination number arises
from the second terminal water molecule bound to Zn1 in
the crystal structure (Figure 2), which may
not be present in the flash frozen EXAFS samples.

The EXAFS
of all three forms of Co(II)-containing VIM-2 (as-isolated
(0.5Co), 1Co, and 2Co) gave similar results, including a first shell
of 4 N/O and 0.5 S scatters, 2 histidines per Co(II), and a metal–metal
interaction at ∼3.51 Å that improved the fits by 53% (0.5
equiv, Figure S4 and Table S4, compare
fit S4-3 to S4-4), 53% (1Co-VIM-2, Figure S5 and
Table S5), and 37% 2Co-VIM-2, Figure S6
and Table S6). The same trend was observed in the Zn(II)-containing
enzymes, suggesting that Co(II) is also bound cooperatively. The longer
Co–Co distance in 2Co-VIM-2 relative to 2Zn-VIM-2 (3.36 Å)
is consistent with the slightly larger covalent radius of high-spin
Co(II). As Co(II) binding mirrored Zn(II) binding, we examined the
Co(II)-substituted enzymes spectroscopically, with confidence the
results could be extrapolated back to the native Zn(II)-containing
enzymes.

UV–Visible Spectroscopy
The UV–visible
spectrum of 1Co-VIM-2 (Figure 5) revealed a
broad absorption at 342 nm (ε342 = 170 M–1 cm–1) that is readily assigned to a Cys-S to Co(II)
ligand-to-metal charge-transfer transition, requiring Co(II) binding
at the Zn2 site.24,48−50 The ligand field transitions between 500 and 650 nm (ε550 = 85 M–1 cm–1) are
similar in shape to those for other B1 MBLs,24,51 and they roughly double in intensity for 2Co-VIM-2, as does the
charge-transfer transition (ε342 = 293 M–1 cm–1 and ε550 = 131 M–1 cm–1), suggesting binding of Co(II) to both sites
in VIM-2 independent of stoichiometry. Similarly low extinction coefficients
were observed for Co(II)-substituted IMP-1 (ε342 =
95 M–1 cm–1 and ε550 = 256 M–1 cm–1).24

EPR Spectroscopy
The EPR spectra
of 1Co- and 2Co-VIM-2,
obtained in both parallel and perpendicular modes, are shown in Figure 6. The perpendicular mode
spectra (black lines in Figure 6) are typical
of Co(II)-substituted metalloproteins,52 with the sharp feature near 1600–1700 G, corresponding to
a small fraction of Fe(III) contamination. Comparison of the 1Co-
and 2Co-VIM-2 spectra shows that they are nearly indistinguishable,
consistent with the EXAFS and optical studies, suggesting that only
the apo- and di-Co enzymes are present at measurable concentrations.
Neither signal could be simulated using an axial g-tensor,
indicating the lack of a unique solution based on the EPR alone.52 Both 1Co- and 2Co-VIM-2 showed strong parallel
mode responses (gray lines in Figure 6), nearly
one-fourth the normalized intensity of the perpendicular response,
with the 2Co enzyme’s signal intensity nearly twice that of
the 1Co enzyme. The EPR data indicate that similar metal centers are
present in 1Co- and 2Co-VIM-2. This loading-dependent coupling, apparent
at substoichiometric levels of metal, supports positive cooperative
binding of Co(II) by VIM-2.

other sample and spectrometer conditions were identical.

Discussion
VIM-2
VIM-2 contains
266 amino acids, with a mass of
29.7 kDa and pI = 5.6, exhibiting 7% structural variation
from VIM-1. VIM-2-expressing bacteria have been shown resistant to
an array of β-lactam-containing antibiotics, including ureidopenicillins,
ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and
meropenem, but strains expressing VIM-2 remained susceptible to the
monobactam aztreonam.14 VIM-2 shares 32%
amino acid identity with BcII from Bacillus cereus, 31% with IMP-1, 27% with CcrA from Bacteroides fragilis, 24% with BlaB from Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, and 24% with IND-1 from Chryseobacterium indologenes. There are significant differences in the steady-state kinetic constants
reported for VIM-2 thus far, kcat and Km values ranging from 9.9 to 34 s–1 and from 9 to 10 μM, respectively, with imipenem.14,32 The steady-state kinetic results are difficult to compare, as metal
content has not been uniformly reported.

Scheme 2 Comparison of Nitrocefin
(Left) and Chromacef (Right) Chromogenic
Substrates
Pre-steady-state kinetic
studies have been reported previously
for CcrA,49,53 Bla2,54 BcII,55 IMP-1,24 and NDM-126 using either nitrocefin or chromacef as substrate
(Scheme 2). For CcrA49,53 and NDM-1,26 the rate-limiting step was
reported to be protonation of the anionic, ring-opened intermediate.
For Bla2, the mono-Co(II) enzyme quantitively formed the intermediate,
suggesting cooperativity in metal binding.54 A similar intermediate was not observed with IMP-124 or BcII.55 In the present study,
stopped-flow experiments on 2Zn-VIM-2 showed only small amounts of
intermediate, up to ∼10% of the total enzyme concentration
(Figure 1A). Interestingly, the chromacef-derived
intermediate formed in the reaction with 2Zn-VIM-2 absorbed at 620
nm, a significant shift from the 575 nm λmax observed
with NDM-1,26 L1, and CcrA (M. Aitha and
M. W. Crowder, unpublished results). The red shift indicates a lower
energy intermediate in VIM-2. This is a point under further investigation.

We have previously reported kinetic and spectroscopic studies on
Co(II)-substituted analogues of L1,33,43,44,54 ImiS,56 IMP-1,24 CcrA,57 Bla2,54 NDM-1,27 and BcII.58 As discussed in
these references, Co(II)-substituted analogues of MBLs have allowed
us to probe the reaction mechanisms, inhibitor/substrate binding,
and structures of these enzymes even when a crystal structure is/was
not available. In this study we have overexpressed, purified, characterized,
and structurally probed VIM-2, which is one of the most important
clinical MBLs and surprisingly has not been as extensively characterized
as other MBLs. The conditions reported above allowed, for the first
time, for Co(II)-substituted VIM-2 to be prepared and characterized.
Optimization of each preparation required different conditions, with
the Zn(II)-containing enzyme obtained from normal culture in LB medium,
while our initial efforts to prepare Co(II)-substituted VIM-2 using
standard methods, including exposure to metal chelators first to generate
apoenzyme followed by direct addition of Co(II), failed. Previous
studies have shown that Cys221 is readily oxidized when VIM-2 is exposed
to chelators, and the resulting enzyme is unable to bind 2 equiv of
metal.29,32 We have successfully used a biological incorporation
method to prepare catalytically active Co(II)-substituted MBLs (L133 and CcrA57) previously,
and this method resulted in an overexpressed VIM-2 that bound 0.5
equiv of Co(II), and no other detectable metals. VIM-2 analogues containing
0.8 and 1.8 equiv of Co(II) were readily generated from this enzyme
by direct addition.

Metal Binding
EXAFS of the Zn(II)-containing
analogues
clearly show that both metal binding sites are occupied, independent
of stoichiometry. The data obtained herein further indicate that they
likely reside in a binuclear cluster, based on the improvement in
the curve fits on inclusion of a metal–metal interaction around
3.36 Å (see Table 4). The metal–metal
distances are consistent with the EXAFS-derived distances in other
B1 MBLs24,26,27,54,57,58 and in the present crystal structure (Figure 2 and Table 3). Together with the steady-state
kinetics (Table 1), which showed a near-linear
dependence in kcat on Zn(II) content,
the EXAFS data indicate positive-cooperative binding of Zn(II) to
VIM-2, where the major species present, at any stoichiometry, are
apo- and di-Zn enzymes.

The present data show that VIM-2 also
exhibits positive-cooperative Co(II) binding. The EXAFS of the Co(II)-containing
enzymes suggest near-stoichiometric formation of dinuclear enzymes
on metal addition, based on even more pronounced fit improvements
on inclusion of the M–M interaction (Table 4). EPR studies are clearly consistent with this model, where
the perpendicular-mode spectra showed virtually indistinguishable
signals whose intensity doubled from 1Co- to 2Co-VIM-2, and strong
parallel-mode responses, indicating the presence of relatively strongly
spin-coupled dinuclear Co(II) centers in both 1Co- and 2Co-VIM2, as
compared to coupling in other MBLs. This may explain the exceptionally
poor NMR response of Co(II)-substituted VIM-2 (Figure S7). Finally, the optical spectra are also consistent
with distributed, cooperative binding, showing both d–d band
structure and charge-transfer (CT) intensity that roughly doubled
from 1Co- (ε342 = 170 M–1 cm–1 and ε550 = 85 M–1 cm–1) to 2Co-VIM-2 (ε342 = 293
M–1 cm–1 and ε550 = 131 M–1 cm–1). These extinction
coefficients are substantially smaller than those reported for the
majority of B1 MBLs, but very similar to that for IMP-1 (ε342 = 256 M–1 cm–1), which
also showed highly cooperative Co(II) binding.24

Comparison with Other Dinuclear B1 MBLs
Among the B1
MBLs studied, VIM-2 appears to show the highest level of metal-binding
cooperativity, based on the spectroscopic and kinetic properties reported
here. Behavior varies widely across the B1 MBL subclass, as summarized
in Table 5.24−27,48,49,55,57−60 To support this, we include two reports on CcrA here.
One is based on an early study by Benkovic and co-workers that reported
an optical titration consistent with distributed Co(II) binding.49 The second is based on our later study, working
with the same construct, which suffered from a significant level of
irretrievable cysteine oxidation, rendering many of the spectroscopic
observables in Table 5 unavailable.57 We have since attempted to repeat these experiments
without success. Given that caveat, all six that have been examined
both kinetically and spectroscopically show evidence of distributed
Co(II) binding, with both sites populated at substoichiometric levels
of metal. All, save CcrA, show some level of cooperativity, based
on the loading-dependence of kcat and
an EXAFS-detected M–M interaction at substoichiometric loading.
However, while half of the enzymes bind Zn(II) in the same fashion
(BcII, IMP-1, and now VIM-2), with varying levels of cooperativity,
the other half (NDM-1, Bla2, and CcrA) bind Zn(II) sequentially, without
cooperativity. Without exception, those that bind Zn(II) cooperatively
appear less capable of stabilizing the anionic intermediate with these
chromogenic substrates, suggesting a shift in the rate-limiting step
relative to those that bind Zn(II) sequentially, which uniformly build
up a large percentage of the intermediate.

To gain insight into this apparent
distinction, we examined more
closely the available structures of the six MBLs in Table 5. Limiting ourselves to doubly zinc-loaded enzymes,
and accepting that there are no such structures of Bla2, the 27 available
structures (including the present one) of the other 5 MBLs show minimal
variability in the position and orientation of metal-coordinating
side chains.28,29,61−74 Comparing nearby side chains and structured waters, as illustrated
in Figure 7, shows two striking differences
between the cooperative and non-cooperative groups. The first is the
variability in the position of the Zn2 ion in the cooperative
group (Figure 7A), compared to the non-cooperative
structures, where placement of the metals is tightly grouped (Figure 7B). Efforts to re-engineer BcII through mutagenesis
have shown similar variability in the position of Zn2,
with dramatic effects on the reactivity of the resulting enzymes.75

green; and 1znb chains A and B, green). All zinc ions are represented as dark gray
spheres. Structured waters within the active sites are shown as red
spheres.

The second, perhaps more pertinent
observation is that the occupancy
of the terminally zinc-coordinated water molecule, which has been
suggested to serve as the proton source in decay of the intermediate,26,42−44,49,53 is substantially lower in the CcrA and NDM-1 structures (non-cooperative,
Figure 7B). While this water molecule occupies
a much more variable position in the cooperative group (BcII, IMP-1,
and VIM-2, Figure 7A), it is present in a much
higher fraction of the structures, suggesting these enzymes are better
poised to turn over the intermediate, once it is formed. The terminally
coordinated water in VIM-2 structures occupies positions similar to
those seen in BcII and IMP-1, despite being held in place by a unique
hydrogen bond donor. In all the other five B1 enzymes, the terminal
water hydrogen bonds to another water that, in turn, hydrogen bonds
to a nearby lysine. VIM-2 lacks the lysine, which is replaced by a
tyrosine oriented away from the metal site. The necessary hydrogen
bond in VIM-2 is provided by an arginine that is 4 residues away,
and oriented as shown in Figure 7A. In the
cooperative group (Figure 7A), the hydrogen
bond donor appears to sample a larger conformational space than in
the non-cooperative group (Figure 7B), which
shows little variation in the position of the lysine side chain. It
is also worth note that the bridging solvent molecule is readily apparent
in most of the cooperative group structures (Figure 7A) and conspicuously absent in the non-cooperative group structures
(Figure 7B).

Within the Co(II) enzymes
in Table 5, the
lines are not as clear. Those that show strong S-to-Co(II) CT bands
(BcII and NDM-1) are the only ones that have shown clearly identifiable
NMR resonances from the cys β-CH2 protons, with weaker
CT bands, presumably associated with substantially reduced hyperfine
couplings, and chemical shifts. The strength of the CT band appears
loosely correlated to the strength of the magnetic coupling in the
di-Co(II) enzymes, based on the strength of the parallel-mode EPR
signal, suggesting that more tightly coupled metal ions allow for
weaker coupling to the thiolate, which has been shown to aid in stabilization
of the anionic intermediate in several B1 MBLs.76 However, this is not a perfect correlation, as among the
group that does not stabilize the intermediate, BcII shows the strongest
CT band of all six. We are continuing to examine these correlations
to better understand the variability in B1 MBLs.

Summary
In summary, this study examines metal binding
to the metallo-β-lactamase VIM-2, demonstrating the first successful
preparation of a Co(II)-substituted VIM-2 analogue. The spectroscopic
studies reveal that Zn(II) and Co(II) bind similarly to VIM-2, with
both metal ions showing cooperative binding where the major species
present, regardless of stoichiometry, are apo- and di-Zn (or di-Co)
enzymes. The crystal structure of the di-Zn enzyme that is presented
is the highest resolution VIM-2 structure to date. Kinetic studies
strongly suggest that VIM-2 utilizes a mechanism that proceeds through
a very short-lived anionic intermediate. Comparison with other B1
enzymes shows that those that bind metal ions cooperatively are better
poised to protonate the intermediate on its formation, compared to
those that bind Zn(II) non-cooperatively, which uniformly build up
substantial amounts of the intermediate. Future studies will address
why positive-cooperative metal binding correlates with the abilty
to protonate the anionic intermediate.
