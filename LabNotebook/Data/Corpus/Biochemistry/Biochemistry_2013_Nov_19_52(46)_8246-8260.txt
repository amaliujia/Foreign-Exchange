The class
A G-protein-coupled
receptors Orexin-1 (OX1) and Orexin-2 (OX2) are located predominantly
in the hypothalamus and locus coeruleus, but are also
found elsewhere in the central nervous system., The
Orexin (OX) receptors are highly conserved across mammalian species.
The human (h) OX1 and OX2 receptors have 64% identical overall sequences,
being 84% identical in the transmembrane regions. The sequence alignment
of hOX1 and hOX2 is shown in Figure . The
OX receptors are linked to a range of different physiological functions,
including the control of feeding, energy metabolism, modulation of
neuroendocrine function,, and regulation of the
sleep–wake cycle., They are also associated
with dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) that are critical elements of the reward system. Although the hypothalamic OX system is known
to regulate appetitive behaviors, and promote
wakefulness and arousal, this system
may also be important in adaptive and pathological anxiety/stress
responses.−

The background color coding is as follows: gray for identical residues,
yellow for chemically homologous residues, cyan for polar residues,
blue for positive residues, red for negative residues, and green for
prolines. The key residues that were involved in SDM are shown by
colored arrows: red arrows for residues mutated by other researchers,
blue arrows for mutations introduced by us, and blue arrows with a
red outline for mutations introduced by other researchers and by us.
The conserved residue in each TM that is assigned to 50 according
to the Ballesteros–Weinstein numbering scheme is denoted with
a black arrow. The red numbers are the amino acid numbers as they
are appear in sequences of OX1 (O43613) and human OX2 (O43614), which
were retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database.

Over the past decade, a large number of OX antagonists have
been
developed as potential drugs for various physiological disorders involving
the Orexin system. Currently, the most clinically advanced Orexin
antagonist is Suvorexant for the treatment
of insomnia. However, it is not only OX antagonists that have therapeutic
potential;, it has also been shown that agonists
of OX receptors have potential− for the treatment of various
diseases, including narcolepsy, obesity, hypophagia, attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorders,
Parkinson’s disease, and colon
cancer. By extension, understanding OX
receptor agonist binding is also important for developing inverse
agonists or antagonists that block this activity. Moreover, the study
of OX agonists is especially important in light of “biased
signaling” of GPCR ligands and
the recent discovery that OX receptors can also signal via the β2-arrestin
signaling pathway. This observation is
particularly important because many of the antagonists originally
thought to block one signaling pathway have a second “hidden”
activity as agonists of second signaling pathways, as was shown for
the antagonists of human H4. Thus, in
light of the broad medicinal evidence of the importance of OX receptors
as potential drug targets,,, there is a need for the exploration of the key structural features
of OX receptors involved in agonist potency, efficacy, and selectivity.
Such information is vital for driving the development of the first
OX receptor nonpeptidic agonists, or even for
improving antagonist performance.,

It was
discovered that hypothalamic neuropeptides Orexin-A/hypocretin-1
[OxA, 33 amino acids (see Figure A)] and Orexin-B/hypocretin-2 [OxB, 28 amino acids
(see Figure A)] agonize their effect through OX1 and OX2 receptors that couple to
Gq/11 and contribute to the activation of phospholipase
C, leading to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. The Orexin peptides can be divided into two
small “domains”, the N-terminus (residues 1–14
in OxA and 1–9 in OxB) and the C-terminus [residues 15–33
in OxA and 10–28 in OxB (see Figure A)]. In spite of the functional homology, the Orexin peptides share
similarity (79%) only in the C-terminal domain. The N-terminus of
OxA contains two intramolecular disulfide bonds formed between C6
and C12 and between C7 and C14. The C-termini of the Orexins are comprised
of two consensus α-helices connected
by a short loop that generates a kink between them.

(A) Amino acid sequence
alignment of human Orexin-A with human
Orexin-B, which was retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database (entry
O43612). The background color coding is as follows: dark blue for
identical residues, light blue for chemically homologous residues,
and pink for chemically nonhomologous residues. Two intramolecular
disulfide bonds in Orexin-A formed between C6 and C12 and between
C7 and C14 are shown as lines. Consensus helical structures are marked with red dashed line. (B) Thirty
conformations of the C-terminus truncated from OxA structures determined
by NMR and extracted from PDB entry 1WSO. The helical
domains are represented by cylinders and loops by tubes. The structures
are colored randomly accordingly to their number in the PDB entry.

Recently, several site-directed
mutagenesis− studies were
conducted to reveal the key residues in both Orexin receptors (Table ) and the peptide (Table ) responsible for their mutual potency and efficacy. Key residues
of OxA and OxB required for their binding to the OX1 and OX2 receptors
have been explored using truncated peptides and alanine scan approaches,
in which each of the peptide residues was systematically substituted
with alanine, or in the case of alanine with
glycine. It was observed that deletion
of the N-terminal domain produces a decrease in the efficacy of OxA
to OX1; however, a C-terminus alone retains a significant agonist
effect., The biological activity of the mutated peptides
was estimated from the transient mobilization of the intracellular
calcium concentration, which was mediated by the receptors bound to
wild type and mutated peptides.

It was observed, (Table ) that mutations of the residues
in the truncated C-terminus of OxA
(L20A, A27A, A28G, G29A, I30A, L31A, T32A, and L33A) significantly
reduce peptide potency with respect to both OX1 and OX2 receptors.
It was also suggested that the G29A mutation caused a significant
disruption of the secondary structure, resulting in a marked decrease
in activity. Mutation of L16 and L19 to alanine resulted in a decrease
in potency with respect to OX1 but had no effect on OX2. Mutation
of H26 to alanine caused a decrease in potency, which was more pronounced
for OX1 than for OX2. Other residues of OxA had a negligible effect
on potencies with respect to both receptors.

For the truncated
C-terminus of OxB, mutations at positions analogous
to those of OxA (L15A, N20A, G24A, I25A, L26A, T27A, and M28A) (L33
in OxA) significantly reduce peptide potency with respect to both
OX1 and OX2 receptors. Mutations L11A and A22G resulted in a decrease
in potency with respect to OX1 but had no effect on that with respect
to OX2. Mutation of A23 to glycine caused a decrease in potency, which
was more pronounced for OX1 than for OX2. Mutation of the conserved
R10 to alanine resulted in a decrease in the potency of OxB with respect
to both OX1 and OX2 receptors. Interestingly, the same mutation of
(conserved) residue R15 in OxA could be tolerated by both receptors.
Mutation of the nonconserved S18 to alanine resulted in a decrease
in the potency to OX2 but had no effect on OX1. Mutation of G19 to
alanine caused significant disruption to the secondary structure,
resulting in a decrease in potency with respect to both OX receptors.
Other residues of OxB had a negligible effect on potencies with respect
to both receptors.

The receptors themselves have also been the
subject of SDM studies
with 29 point mutations (18 in hOX2 and 11 in hOX1) that were introduced
into the 7TMD region to explore their effect on hOX1 or hOX2 mediation
of the Orexin-A-evoked [Ca2+]i response (see
Figure  and Table ).

In OX1, mutations V130A3.36, D203A45.51,
W206A45.54, Y215A5.38, F219A5.42,
Y224A5.47, Y311A6.48, and H344A7.39 caused large decreases in the potency of OxA (30.6-, 408.2-, 417.8-,
407.8-, 139.6-, 84.4-, 163.9-, and 241.1-fold, respectively) compared
with that of the WT (Table ). Mutations W206A45.54 and Y311A6.48 also resulted in decreases in
the maximal efficacy (Emax) of 45.0 and
53.4%, respectively, for OxA and OxB. Other mutations had no major
effect on efficacy.

In OX2, mutations T111A2.61,
D211A45.51,
W214A5.54, Y223A5.38, F227A5.42,
F346A7.35, and H350A7.39 caused large decreases
in the potency of OxA (243.5-, 416.1-, 62.4-, 183.9-, 240.3-, 54.5-,
and 49.5-fold, respectively) without affecting their efficacy compared
with that of the WT. Mutations Y232A5.47 and Y317A6.48 resulted in a decrease in both EC50 (by 28.4-
and 17.7-fold, respectively) and Emax (44.9
and 49.6%, respectively) of OxA. Mutation Q134A3.32 caused
a moderate decrease in the potency of OxA (22.3-fold) without affecting
its efficacy.

This SDM data suggests that there is no clear
correlation between
the importance of residues for potency and for efficacy; residues
in positions (Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering) 2.61, 45.51, 5.54, 5.38, 5.42, 7.35, and 7.39 are important
for the potency of OxA in both receptors, while mutations at other
positions (45.45 and 6.48 in OX1 and 5.47 and 6.48 in OX2) reduce
both potency and efficacy.

In this work, we used SDM data, OxA
NMR structures, OxB models,
and OX1 and OX2 models to explain the role of key residues in both
peptides and receptors responsible for agonist binding. We used homology
modeling followed by MD simulation and ensemble-flexible docking to
generate docking poses of Orexins in the inactive or semiactive forms
of the OX receptors. We flexibly docked the Orexin peptides into post-MD
substates of inactive forms of Orexin receptors. A significant body
of evidence suggests that GPCRs are not simple two-state switches
but rather encompass a wide spectrum of states, substates and intermediates. It has been observed that GPCRs exist in at
least two highly populated distinct inactive states and in many intermediate
substates. Furthermore, recently published
NMR data suggest that there is a dynamic equilibrium between functional
substates of GPCRs and that agonists
initially bind to the inactive state of the GPCR and then promote
it toward the active state. Ligands play a key role in stabilizing
or destabilizing intermediates involved in GPCR activation and have
a clear influence on GPCR substate populations. In simplistic terms,
a positive enthalpy change upon activation often reflects the loss
of stabilizing interhelical interactions associated with the inactive
state, while increases in entropy can be associated with increased
protein dynamics or the release of waters
of hydration. The addition of an agonist
increases the relative population of the activation intermediates
for a sufficient period of time to engage a G-protein. Dynamic computational techniques such as MD
simulations followed by flexible docking have the potential to go
beyond the use of static homology models.− They offer a way to sample different functional substates of the
GPCRs,, and for the
rationalization of its ligand binding and functional effects.,− However, when using this approach, one is often unsure of the relevance
of all the substates sampled. To help prioritize the analysis of the
sampled substates, we developed a new protein pairwise similarity
method (ProS) to compare and visualize the structural data generated
in an MD run and to cluster the GPCR substructures sampled. To that
end, we developed a GPCR-likeness assessment score (GLAS) that allows
us to score the clusters according to their agreement with the GPCR
conserved 24 inter-TM contacts as described by Venkatakrishnan et
al.

Finally, we validated our modeling
results by extending the existing
SDM data. Our particular interest was focused on position 4.60, located
in the proximity of position 3.33 that was previously identified as
being critical for antagonist binding and selectivity. Position 4.60
in TM4 is occupied by conserved residue Q1794.60 in OX1
and Q1874.60 in OX2.

Materials and Methods
Residue
Numbering
We used both sequence number and
the Ballesteros and Weinstein numbering
system to identify amino acid positions as described by us previously. In the latter, transmembrane (TM) residues are
given two numbers; the first is the TM helix number (1–7),
while the second indicates the position relative to the most conserved
residue in that TM, which is arbitrarily assigned to be 50. We number
the loops in a similar manner; for example, the conserved cysteine
in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) would be labeled 45.50, to indicate
its presence between TM4 and TM5.

Multiple-Sequence Alignment,
Homology Modeling, and Molecular
Dynamics
The production of a multiple-sequence alignment
and template selection for homology modeling were conducted as previously
described by us, so here we give a brief
account. Sequences of human OX1 (O43613) and human OX2 (O43614) were
retrieved from Swiss-Prot database and aligned with four published
crystal structures of GPCR receptors [bovine rhodopsin (PDB entry 1U19), human dopamine D3 receptor (D3, PDB entry 3PBL), human A2A adenosine receptor (A2A, PDB entry 3EML), and the β2-adrenergic receptor
(β2AR, PDB entry 2RH1)], using MOE (version
2010.10, Chemical Computing Group). Potential templates were ranked
on the basis of the maximal number of correctly aligned prolines in
the 7TMD. The D3 structure had the largest number of aligned prolines
and was chosen as the template for homology modeling again using MOE,
with the resulting model minimized using the MMFF94x force field. To minimize the modeling “noise”
between OX receptors and to generate equal starting points for further
study, we used the hOX1 model as the template to model hOX2. The models
were embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) bilayer using the g_membed feature of GROMACS and an energy minimization with a steepest descent
algorithm until convergence with a force tolerance of 0.239 kcal mol–1 Å–1 was performed. Sodium
and chloride ions were then added to the systems to a concentration
of 150 mM followed by a restrained MD run whereby all heavy atoms
were restrained by a harmonic potential of 2.39 kcal mol–1 Å–2 for 200 ps. Finally, 50 ns production
runs were performed on three repeats that differed in their initial
velocities only. MD simulations were conducted with GROMACS version
4.5.4 using the OPLS-AA, force field and TIP3P water molecules Production simulations were performed in an NPT ensemble maintained at 310 K and 1 bar. The integration time step
was set to 2 fs, and a stochastic dynamics integrator was used. Long-range electrostatics were calculated using
the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method with
a 14 Å cutoff and 1 Å space grid. The Lennard-Jones potential
used a cutoff of 9 Å, with a switch at 8 Å. The LINCS algorithm was used to constrain bond lengths in both the
lipid molecules and the protein.

Ensemble-Flexible Docking
Protocol
We used the “ensemble-flexible
docking protocol”, a built-in function of the GOLD docking
package (version 5.0, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre). The
ensemble docking is a procedure that allows simultaneous docking of
ligands into multiple substates (structures) of the same GPCR., When multiple GPCR substates are available, one does not know a priori which substate will give the best docking performance.
One strong advantage of ensemble docking is that it very significantly
reduces the risk of inadvertently choosing an unsuitable substate
model. In our case, the substates of Orexin receptors were retrieved
from MD (see Figure ) simulation runs. Ensemble
docking in GOLD version 5.0 uses a genetic algorithm that makes this
process more efficient with respect to sequential docking, which requires
substantial postprocessing to identify the best ranking poses from
the different docking experiments.

Plot of the
GPCR score vs the X-ray resolution of the 117 GPCR
crystal structures extracted from the PDB. The color coding for each
of the data points is based on its GPCR subfamily.

We assigned flexibility to key residues in both
receptors and peptides
using the GOLD rotamer library to improve their steric fit and to
ensure that the docking procedure could adjust the site to accommodate
large molecules such as Orexin peptides. The list of key residues
was taken from SDM data. In the case of OX1, the flexibility was assigned
to nine residues: Q1263.32, V1303.36, D20345.51, W20645.54, Y215A5.38, F2195.42, Y2245.47, Y3116.48, and H3447.39. In OX2, the flexibility was assigned to nine residues:
Q134A3.32, D21145.51, W2145.54, Y2235.38, F2275.42, Y232A5.47, Y317A6.48, F3467.35, and H3507.39. In the
truncated C-terminus of OxA, the flexibility was assigned to nine
residues: L16, L19, L20, N25, H26, I30, L31, T32, and L33. In the
truncated C-terminus of OxB, the flexibility was assigned to nine
residues: L11, L14, L15, N20, H21, I25, L26, T27, and M28.

We
docked each conformer of the peptide independently into an ensemble
of six receptor substates taken from MD. The docking poses were scored
by the GOLD ChemPLP scoring function recommended for ensemble docking,, and we retained the 10 top-ranked docking poses for each receptor–peptide
complex. The best pose of the receptor–peptide complex was
selected on the basis of the maximal number of interactions between
SDM-validated key residues of the receptor and the peptide responsible
for peptide potency and efficacy.

Protein Pairwise Similarity
(ProS)
We developed a new
method, which we call ProS, to analyze and visualize the structural
data generated via MD and to cluster the variety of GPCR substructures
sampled by MD simulation. We used this tool to compare substates of
OX receptors produced in our MD run. In this method, two proteins
are considered similar if two conditions occurred simultaneously:
(1) if the residues of the relevant pair have the same type evaluated
by the substitution matrix blosum65 and (2) if the
“positions” and “directions” of the relevant
residue pair are similar. In the case of GPCRs, the relevant residue
pairs are considered for those residues that have the same Ballesteros
and Weinstein index. The position and direction of each residue are
defined by the coordinates of its Cα and Cβ atoms, respectively.
We assume that if the distance between the Cβ atoms of two relevant
residues is small then the side chains of these residues can also
adopt similar conformations. The global protein similarity score, SProtein–Similarity, is calculated via
eq :where
SA(protein 1,protein 2)scaled describes the average similarity
in positions and the term SB(protein 1,protein 2)scaled describes the average similarity
in residue type and direction of the relevant residue pairs. The term
SA(protein 1,protein 2)scaled is calculated via eq :where the score ranges between 0 and 1 (1
indicates 100% similar, and 0 means there is no similarity). N is the number of the relevant pairs, and SA(protein 1,protein 2)i is the individual score calculated
per pair using eq :where dCα1i,Cα2i is the distance between Cα atoms of
the residues of relevant pair i in proteins 1 and
2. The average SB(protein 1,protein 2)scaled is calculated in the same manner
as SA(protein 1,protein 2)scaled, and the similarity of residue type and
direction of each relevant pair SB(protein 1,protein 2)i is calculated via eq :where dCβ1i,Cβ2i is the distance between Cβ atoms of
the residues of relevant pair i in proteins 1 and
2 and α is the substitution score taken from the blossum65 substitution
matrix. ProS results are mapped back onto the proteins to allow visualization.
Clustering based on ProS was performed using Ward’s clustering
method as implemented in MOE.

GPCR-Likeness
Assessment Score (GLAS)
We also developed
a GPCR-likeness assessment score (GLAS) to assess how “GPCR-like”
our GPCR models and MD-derived structures (substates) are. GLAS is
based on the conserved 24 inter-TM contacts as described by Venkatakrishnan
et al. In a comparison of the crystal
structures of diverse GPCRs using a network representation, it was
shown that some of the contacts between TM helices are conserved,
in a manner independent of the sequence diversity or functional state
of the given GPCR. A systematic analysis of the different GPCR structures,
which includes both active and inactive states, revealed a consensus
network of 24 inter-TM contacts mediated by 36 topologically equivalent
amino acids. In this consensus network, the contacts are present in
all (or all but one) of the structures, irrespective of their conformational
state, and thus are likely to represent “molecular signatures”
of the GPCR fold. The significance of
the residues in these positions is highlighted by the fact that mutations
in 14 of 36 positions have been observed to result in either an increase
or a loss of receptor activity. The basic
assumption in our GLAS scoring function is that high-quality GPCR
models must show a large number of these 24 conserved contacts. Here
we define that a pair of residues is in contact if the Euclidean distance
between any pair of atoms (side chain and/or main chain atoms) is
within the van der Waals interaction distance (that is, the sum of
the van der Waals radii of the atoms plus 0.6 Å). The list of
contacts obtained for the model is compared to the list of 24 conserved
contacts. The overall GPCR score for the individual model is the number
of its conserved contacts divided by 24 (the maximum), when the highest
score is 1 (all 24 contacts are present) and the lowest score is 0
(none of the 24 contacts are present).

Construction of Point-Mutated
OX1 and OX2
A combination
of overlap and mismatch polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
introduce mutations into the corresponding Orexin-1 and Orexin-2 cDNAs
as described by us previously. Each mutation
was made via the generation of two overlapping PCR fragments with
PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Strategene). The two products
were extracted, and a second round of PCR was performed via combination
of both fragments with 5′ and 3′ gene specific primers
(containing BamHI and NotI restriction sites, respectively). The resulting
gel-purified products were then cloned into expression vector pFB-Neo
for subsequent generation of stable cell lines. Constructs were confirmed
via sequencing. Each verified cDNA was subsequently used to generate
single, stably expressing clones in the CHO-K1 cell line.

Calcium Flux
Assays
Standard calcium flux assays were
used to assess the functionality of each OX receptor mutant. Each
CHO-K1 Orexin mutant was seeded into tissue culture-treated, 384-well,
black clear-bottom plates (CellBind Corning 7086), at a density of
7500 cells/well in culture medium and maintained in an incubator (5%
CO2 at 37 °C) overnight. The cell medium was removed,
and the cells were incubated in 20 μL of assay buffer (4 μM
Fluo-4AM in HBSS with 0.1% BSA) for 90 min at 37 °C. After incubation,
the dye was removed and 45 μL of fresh buffer, without dye,
was applied. Antagonists (5 μL) were applied, and after incubation
for an additional 20 min at 37 °C, 20 μL of receptor specific
agonists was applied and the calcium flux monitored using a Flex Station
(Molecular Devices) over a period of 1 min. In all cases, the EC80 specific for the individual mutant as determined in previous
experiments was reported.

Results
Evaluation
of the GPCR Scoring Function (GLAS)
GLAS
was calculated for 117 crystal structures of class A GPCRs stored
in the PDB (see Table S1 of the ). We plotted the GLAS for each crystal structure against its resolution
(see Figure ) and found that the average GLAS
decreases with a decreasing resolution in a manner independent of
GPCR subfamily; 12 high-resolution (≤2.5 Å) GPCR crystal
structures have a GLAS on average of 0.99, 54 structures with a resolution
in the range from 2.51 to 3.0 Å a GLAS on average of 0.98, 40
structures with a resolution in the range from 3.0 to 3.5 Å have
a GLAS on average of 0.91, and 11 structures with a resolution of
&gt;3.5 Å have a GLAS on average of 0.91. The distribution of
GLAS
versus structure resolution is shown in Figure S1 of the . Although this result
is intriguing, the data set is still quite small, and our main motivation
for this procedure was to provide a means for assessing how “GPCR-like”
our MD-derived structures are.

of human OX1 and OX2 was as described by us previously. Briefly, the homology model of the human OX1
receptor was modeled on the basis of a 2.8 Å high-resolution
crystal structure of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3, PDB entry 3PBL). Of the possible
templates available in the PDB at the time of preparation of this
paper, D3 shared the greatest number of aligned prolines (five in
total) with both hOX1 and hOX2 receptors, including the important
proline in position 4.59. The multiple-sequence
alignment is shown in Figure S2 of the . Thus, D3 was preferred as the best template for
OX receptor modeling. D3 has also a higher degree of sequence similarity
with the hOX1 and hOX2 receptors than other GPCRs (65.5% when comparing
just the 7TMD region). The homology model of hOX2 was constructed
using the hOX1 model as a template. This was done to minimize the
modeling noise between the OX receptors, to ease the comparison between
them, and to generate equal starting points for the MD simulation
studies. The homology models obtained for hOX1 and hOX2 receptors
were employed as starting points for extensive MD simulations in an
atomistic model of the membrane. It was observed that after 3 ns of
MD, the Cα atom fluctuations over time for all three MD simulation
repeats were within the same narrow range of 1.7–2.4 Å, which is comparable to the values typically
obtained for MD simulations of GPCR crystal structures.

Clustering of OX1 and OX2 Structures
Initially, we
harvested 51 decoys (models) for each OX receptor from the MD run
and homology modeling (one structure per nanosecond of the MD run
over 50 ns plus one initial homology model). Then we calculated a
protein similarity matrix (dimensions of 51 × 51) for these 51
decoys using the ProS method (SProtein–Similarity; see the heat map describing this result in Figure S3A of the  for OX1 and Figure S3B
of the  for OX2)
as outlined in . Next
we used this ProS similarity matrix to cluster these 51 decoys using
Ward’s clustering method (see
the hierarchical agglomerative clustering tree in Figure S4 of the  for OX1 and Figure S5
of the  for OX2)
into six clusters. We also calculated the GLAS for each of these 51
decoys and plotted the change in GLAS versus time for the 50 ns MD
simulation to evaluate how our simulated structures agree with known
crystallographic structures in terms of key, well-conserved features
among all GPCRs (see plots in Figure A for
OX1 and Figure B for OX2). It can be seen
that the MD structures are as good if not better in this regard than
some of the lower-resolution X-ray structures, which we took as reassurance
that the MD-generated structures are sensible. We took one representative
conformer from each of the six clusters with the highest GLAS for
further analysis and docking experiments. It is interesting that the
GLAS tends to drift lower with time. However, it is still comparable
to the range of GLAS values calculated for crystal structures. Regardless,
in this work, we took the top-scored/ranked representative from each
cluster observed that was &gt;0.85 (see plots in Figure A for OX1 and Figure B for OX2), and
therefore, we have no reason to suspect our level of confidence should
be lower.

their cluster membership as defined by their ProS.

Modeling the C-Terminus of OxA and OxB
OxA coordinates
were taken from the NMR-determined structure (PDB entry 1WSO()). We selected the NMR structure of OxA and not the X-ray
structure because we were interested in exploring the conformational
space of the peptide and not just one snapshot. This was required
for our docking procedure. The low-energy “bioactive”
conformation of the molecules can frequently be found among the conformations
of this molecule in water. The structure
of the C-terminus of OxA in water consists
of two α-helices (see Figure A) making
various angles within a 60–80° range relative to each
other and the flexible linker connecting these helices (Figure B). The 30 conformations of the C-terminus of OxB
were homology modeled on the basis of the 30 conformations of OxA
using the alignment as shown in Figure A with
MOE (version 2010.10, Chemical Computing Group).

Predicted Mode
of Binding of OxA in OX1 and OX2
The
30 conformations of OxA obtained from the NMR ensemble (PDB entry 1WSO) were docked into
six conformers of OX1 harvested from MD using the ensemble-flexible
docking protocol (see Figure ). This protocol
allows efficient docking of the peptide to the receptor as it is provides
sufficient flexibility for both the receptor and the peptide. The
10 top-ranked complexes for OxA, based on the GOLD default scoring
function, were visually inspected. Of
these 10 docking poses, the best pose of OxA in OX1 was selected on
the basis of the maximal number of interactions between SDM-validated
key residues of OX2 and OxA responsible for OxA potency and efficacy.
The proposed docking pose of OxA in the OX1 binding site is shown
in Figure A, and the two-dimensional (2D)
interaction map is shown in Figure C. The
OX1 binding site for OxA is formed by TMs 3 and 5–7. We explored
if the key residues found in the SDM of OX1 generate interactions
with the key residues found in the alanine scan of OxA. We predict
that residue L16 forms van der Waals type interactions with H3447.39, and D20345.51 is in the proximity of L19 and
could potentially form a nonclassical hydrogen bond., Residues H3447.39 and W20645.54 generate a
hydrophobic “sandwich” with L20 of OxA. Q1263.34 forms an interaction with A27 of OxA. N25 is in the proximity of
Y2155.38 and could potentially make a hydrogen bond during
the activation process. F2195.42 forms a face-to-edge π–π
stack with H26. Residues Y2245.47 and V1303.36 generate another hydrophobic sandwich with I30. The Y3116.48 side chain forms van der Waals interactions with L31, and the backbone
of Y3116.48 interacts with T32 of OxA (Figure A). These last two interactions seem to be essential
for both the potency and the efficacy of OxA agonism. The Y311A6.48 mutation results in a large decrease in both the potency
and the efficacy of OxA and correlates
with the same effect of the L31A mutation. These predictions are supported by the fact that Y3116.48 is part of the transmission switch (previously called the “toggle
switch”) that is proposed to play a role in GPCR activation. Finally, L33 generates hydrophobic interactions
with V1303.36, which forms part of the conserved VSVSVAVL
motif of TM3OX1.

conformations of the C-terminally truncated form of OxA (determined

domains 1–7 are colored dark orange, pink, red, purple, dark
red, orange, and light yellow, respectively. Interstrand cross-links
are colored cyan, ECLs dark green, and the C-termini of OxA and OX1
gray.

Best pose of OxA in OX1 (A and C) and OX2 (B
and D) models. The
loops, TM2 and TM3, were hidden to expose the binding pocket. Transmembrane
domains 1–7 are colored dark orange, pink, red, purple, dark
red, orange, and light yellow, respectively, and OxA is colored light
pink. Only the key residues taken from SDM data are shown; carbon
atoms of OxA are colored pink and those of receptors yellow. Nitrogen
atoms are colored blue, oxygen atoms red, sulfur atoms yellow, and
chlorine atoms light green. Interactions with key residues are indicated
by black lines. Panels C and D show a two-dimensional interaction
map between OxA and OX receptors.

The same protocol was used to dock the same 30 conformations
of
OxA into OX2 (see panels B and D of Figure ) and the same procedure used to evaluate the best pose. The predicted
pose suggests that residue L16 forms a hydrophobic interaction with
F3467.35. D21145.51 is in the proximity of L19.
L19 and L20 form hydrophobic interactions with W21445.54 and H3507.39, respectively. Unlike OX1, N25 of OxA does
not form a hydrogen bond with the tyrosine at position 5.38 (Y2155.38 in OX1, but Y2235.38 in OX2). In the case of
OX2, Y2235.38 forms an interaction with H26 of OxA. F2275.42 forms a nonpolar interaction with I30. Y3176.48 is in nonpolar contact with L31, and this interaction is essential
for both the potency and the efficacy of OxA agonism. Mutating Y3176.48 to alanine results in a decrease in potency of 17.7-fold
and efficacy (relative Emax decreases
to 49.6%) of OxA, which correlates with
the L30A mutation in OxA that resulted in the abolishment of both
the potency and the efficacy of OxA. Similar
to OX1, the peptide L33 residue interacts with V1423.40. The side chain of T32 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of
Y3176.48 and a hydrophobic contact with Y2325.47.

Predicted Mode of Binding of OxB in OX1 and OX2
The
same procedure was performed for binding of OxB to OX1 and OX2. The
predicted docking pose of OxB in OX1 is shown in Figure A along with a 2D interaction map in Figure C. The OX1–OxB binding site is formed by TM3 and TM5–7.
Unsurprisingly, but reassuringly, we find similar interaction patterns
for the OxB peptide compared to the OxA peptide. We predict that L11
of OxB forms a nonpolar interaction with H3447.39. This
same histidine along with W20645.54 generates a hydrophobic
sandwich with L15. D20345.51 is in the proximity of L14
and could potentially form a nonclassical hydrogen bond., A potential salt bridge can be formed between R15 and D20345.51. Y2155.38 and N20 are in the proximity of each other
and with a slight adjustment could potentially form a reasonable hydrogen
bond. Residue F2195.42 forms a nonpolar interaction with
H21. Residues Y2245.47 and V1303.36 generate
a nonpolar sandwich with I25. Y3116.48 interacts with L26,
and the side chain of T27 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone
of Y3116.48. Similar to the situation for OxA, these last
two interactions seem to be essential for both the potency and the
efficacy of OxB agonism. The Y311A6.48 mutation resulted
in a large decrease in both the potency and the efficacy of OxB and correlates with the same effect of the L26A
mutation, which results in the abolishment of both the potency and
the efficacy of OxB. Finally, M28 forms
a hydrophobic interaction with Y2245.47.

Best pose of OxB in OX1
(A and C) and OX2 (B and D) models. The
loops, TM2 and TM3, were hidden to expose the binding pocket. Transmembrane
domains 1–7 are colored dark orange, pink, red, purple, dark
red, orange, and light yellow, respectively, and OxB is colored gray.
Only the key residues taken from SDM data are shown; carbon atoms
of OxB are colored gray and those of receptors yellow. Nitrogen atoms
are colored blue, oxygen atoms red, sulfur atoms yellow, and chlorine
atoms light green. Interactions with key residues are indicated by
black lines. Panels C and D show a two-dimensional interaction map
between OxB and OX receptors.

The OX2–OxB binding pose (Figure B,D) predicts that residue L11 forms a nonpolar interaction
with
F3467.35, L14 interacts with W21445.54, and
H3507.39 forms a hydrophobic interaction with L15 of OxB.
As was the case for OX2–OxB interactions, D21145.51 is in the proximity of L14 and could potentially form a nonclassical
hydrogen bond,, and a potential salt bridge could
be formed between R15 and D20345.51. Unlike the case in
OX1, Y2235.38 (the equivalent in OX1 is Y2155.38) does not interact with N20. F2275.42 forms a nonpolar
interaction with I25, and Y3176.48 generates hydrophobic
complementarity with L26. Substituting L26 with a d-amino
acid resulted in 17000-fold decrease in EC50 compared to
that of the wild type. As stated before,
this latter interaction is likely to be centrally important. M28 forms
nonpolar interactions with V1423.40. The side chain of
T32 generates a hydrogen bond with the backbone of Y3176.48. On the basis of the SDM data and these modeling observations, it
seems that helix 2 of OxA and OxB is playing a major role in Orexin
receptor binding and activation.

Discussion
SDM
data that have been produced independently for Orexin receptors
and for peptides were paired by homology modeling, MD simulation,
and ensemble-flexible docking to isolate the key interactions responsible
for agonist potency and efficacy. This working model should be useful
for the design of nonpeptidic Orexin agonists together with improving
the chances of designing selective or “biased” antagonists.
In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of a new, protein pairwise
similarity method (ProS) and a GPCR scoring function (GLAS) in analyzing
structural data produced by MD simulations. We used homology modeling
followed by MD simulation and flexible docking to generate docking
poses of Orexins in the inactive or semiactive forms of the OX receptors.
We flexibly docked the Orexin peptides into post-MD substates of inactive
forms of Orexin receptors.

The docked modes along with the SDM
data suggest that helix 2 of
OxA and OxB (see Figure A) plays a major role
in Orexin receptor binding and activation. Mutation of any helix 2
residue (A29–L33 in OxA and A24–M28 in OxB) to alanine
(or in case of alanine to glycine) resulted in an almost total loss
of the peptides’ potency and efficacy for both Orexin receptors
(see Table ). It seems that for A28 in OxA
and A23 in OxB, mutation to glycine has an impact on the α-helical
conformation of the peptides. Glycine residues tend to disrupt helices
because of their high conformational flexibility, which consequently
makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained
α-helical structure needed to bind to the receptor. The α-helical nature of the Orexin peptides
in this area is apparently essential for a bioactive conformation
and consequent potency and efficacy.

It seems that the aromatic
nature of Y6.48 in both receptors
is critical for the potency of both agonists. Mutation of Y6.48 to alanine significantly reduces agonist potency (see Table ) for both receptors,
but mutation of Y6.48 to phenylalanine had almost no effect
on potency. According to our model, Y6.48 in both receptors
generates a hydrophobic overlay with the conserved residues, L31 in
OxA and L26 in OxB. This interaction seems to be very important for
both the potency and the activation by both agonists because (i) the
Y6.48A mutation in the receptors, L31A in OxA or L26A in
OxB, kills both potency and efficacy and (ii) Y6.48 is
part of the transmission switch (previously called the toggle switch)
that is associated with GPCR activation. Furthermore, the predicted binding modes suggest that the backbone
carbonyl of Y6.48 forms an interaction with T32 (in OxA)
and T27 (in OxB). Mutation of T32 or T27 in OxA or OxB, respectively,
results in a loss of potency.

Mutation of Y5.47 to
alanine resulted in a significant
decrease in OxA potency. Y5.47 interacts with T32 when
OxA is bound to OX1 and with I30 when OxA is bound to OX2. Because
residues T32 and I30 are both essential for the potency of OxA, we
predict that interactions between Y5.47 and T32 and I30
are critical for receptor activation by OxA. We note that position
5.47 has been found to be involved in agonist binding in other receptors;
for example, it plays a role in the binding and activation of β2-adrenergic
receptor agonists.

C-Terminal residues,
L33 in OxA and M28 in OxB, appear to play
an important role in the activation process. Mutation of these residues
to alanine almost abolished potency. We observed that these residues
form shape complementarity with the subpocket generated by the VSVSVAVL motif of TM3OX1 or VSVSVSVL motif of TM3OX2. Our results suggest
that these long terminal residues, L33 in OxA and M28 in OxB, are
responsible for “anchoring” the agonists in the receptor
pockets. The OX1 subpocket is more hydrophobic than the OX2 subpocket,
because of the presence of alanine at position X in the VSVSVXVL motif in TM3OX1 compared to a serine
in TM3OX2. This small difference can impact the subtype
selectivity of the peptides. For OxA, L33 generates a nonpolar interaction
with V1303.36 that is part of the conserved VSVSVAVL
motif of TM3OX1 (see Figure A).
The V130A3.36 mutation in OX1 reduces the potency by 30.6-fold.
However, the V138A3.36 mutation of TM3OX2 had
no impact on potency (see Table ). In our
model, L33 of OxA interacts with another valine (V1423.40) that is also part of the conserved VSVSVSVL
motif of TM3OX2 (see Figure B).
The same types of interactions are also formed between M28 of OxB
and V1303.36 in OX1 (see Figure A) and between M28 of OxB and V1423.40 in OX2 (see Figure B). The
involvement of TM3 in most GPCR activation processes is a very common
phenomenon that has been extensively described in the literature.,

We also explored the role of the conserved F5.42. The
mutation of this residue to alanine in both receptors reduces the
potencies for OxA (see Table ) and efficacy
of OxA in OX2 to 64.3%. However, the
decrease in potency in the case of OX2 was doubled (240.3-fold) compared
to that of OX1 (139.6-fold) (see Table ).
In the case of OX1, F5.42 interacts with H26 of OxA that,
based on the SDM experiments, has an only moderate impact on potency
(see Figure A). This is in contrast to OX2
in which F5.42 interacts with key residue I30 (see Figure B). Mutation of I30 of OxA to alanine completely
abolished the potency of OxA for both receptors [in the case of OX1,
I30 interacts with Y2245.47 (see Figure A)]. It seems that in the case of OxB, F5.42 plays
a key role in potency for both receptors, by interacting with key
residue I25 (see Figure A,B). This observation
is supported by the SDM data: mutation of F5.42 to tryptophan
abolishes the potency of OxB with respect to OX2 (see Table ), and mutation of I25 to alanine abolishes the
potency of OxB for both receptors (see Table ).

The role of the conserved Y5.38 was also clarified
when
mutation of this residue to alanine resulted in the abolishment of
OxA potency (see Table ) and a moderate loss
of efficacy for both receptors. According
to the model, Y5.38 is located near the linker (kink) connecting
helix 1 and helix 2 of the peptides (see Figure A for OX1 and Figure B for OX2). We hypothesize
that Y5.38 can play a role in stabilizing the relative
angle between helix 1 and helix 2 and, by doing so, helps to stabilize
the bioactive conformation of OxA in the same mode as OxB (see Figure ). In the case of OX1, this effect can be supported
by the observation that Y2155.38 can potentially form a
hydrogen bond with N25 of OxA that is located at the beginning of
this flexible linker. However, the generation of this hydrogen bond
is hindered by the interhelical hydrogen bond between Y2155.38 and Q1794.60 that limits Y2155.38 flexibility.
To validate this hypothesis, we mutated Q1794.60 to alanine,
predicting that by breaking this interhelical hydrogen bond we will
“release” the Y2155.38 to generate a hydrogen
bond with N25, and indeed, it resulted in a 17.8-fold improvement
in the potency of OxA with respect to OX1 (see Table ). In the case of OX2, however, the model predicts that N25
would not form a hydrogen bond with Y2155.38. As predicted
when we mutated Q1874.60 (that forms a hydrogen bond with
Y2155.38) to alanine, we observed no effect on the binding
of OxA to OX2 (see Table ). Although these
results concerning potency agree well with the prediction, we should
caution the reader that the experiments are based on our Ca2+ concentration assay and thus do not preclude other possibilities
such as destabilization of native states or inhibition of the transition
from inactive to active in other ways.

Analogous to the potential
interaction between N25 of OxA and Y2155.38, N20 of OxB
can potentially form a similar interaction,
which again would be hindered by the presence of the interhelical
hydrogen bond between Y2155.38 and Q1794.60.
We predicted that, in a fashion similar to that of OxA, OxB would
be able to form a hydrogen bond via N20 to Y2155.38 if
Q1794.60 were mutated to alanine. Consistent with this
prediction, the potency of OxB at OX1 was observed to increase 72.2-fold
(Table ). In OX2, we predicted that N20 of
OxB does not form a hydrogen bond to Y2155.38; thus, mutating
Q1874.60 in this case would not be expected to affect OxB
binding, which, again, we observed (Table ).

An additional residue that plays a key role in OX receptor
agonist
binding and activation by Orexin peptides is H7.39. Mutation
of this residue to alanine resulted in a severe decrease in the potency
of OxA (see Table ) and in 64.5 and 63.0%
decreases in its Emax values for OX1 and
OX2, respectively. We observed that in
OX1, H7.39 interacts with residues L16 and L20 of helix
1 of OxA (see Figure A). Mutation of L16 or
L20 of OxA to alanine resulted in a loss of potency of OxA with respect
to OX1. On the other hand, in OX2, H7.39 interacts with
L20 and not with L16 (see Figure B), and this
observation is supported by the SDM data; mutation of L16 to alanine
had no effect on the binding of OxA to OX2 compared to the dramatic
effect of mutating L20. In the case of OxB, we do not have SDM data
for H7.39; however, we predict that H7.39 interacts
with residues L11 and L15 of helix 1 of OxB (see Figure A). Mutation of L11 or L15 of OxB to alanine resulted in a
loss of potency of OxB with respect to OX1. On the other hand, in
OX2, H7.39 interacts with L15 only, and not with L11 (see
Figure B). This observation is supported by
the SDM data; mutation of L11 to alanine had no effect on the binding
of OxB to OX2 compared to a dramatic effect observed for mutating
L15, where a similar selective effect was previously observed by Asahi
et al.

Mutation of D45.51 and W45.54 can also be
beneficial for agonist potency. The mutation of these residues to
alanine resulted in a loss of potency of OxA for both receptors. We
predict that D45.51 generates a steric effect with L19
of OxA for both receptors and W45.54 interacts with L20
of OxA when binding to OX1 (see Figure A)
and with L19 in OxA when binding to OX2 (see Figure B).

It seems to be primarily residues of TM3, -5, and
-6 that are involved
in both the potency and the efficacy of the agonists. For the discovery
of novel nonpeptidic Orexin agonists, we recommend, on the basis of
these results, that the main targets for ligand design should be interactions
with Y6.48, the hydrophobic motif of VSVSVXVL in TM3, Y5.38, F5.42,
Y5.47, and H7.39. Interaction with D45.51 and W45.54 can be beneficial for binding of both agonists
and antagonists, as shown in our previous publication.

In terms of how the result might be interpreted
with respect to
activation, it seems that the binding of large molecules, like OxA
and OxB peptides, to the interior space of the receptor destabilizes
its most populated inactive state and, by doing so, promotes the receptor
toward the active state. OxA and OxB peptides disturb noncovalent
interactions between different TMs, especially the link between TM3
and TM6 formed in the binding site by S3.35 and Y6.48 and the hydrophobic triad of V3.40, L3.43,
and F6.44. We observed that hydrogen bonds between S3.35 and Y6.48 (defined when the distance between
oxygen atoms of the OH group of S3.35 and Y6.48 is ≤3.5 Å) appear at a frequency of &gt;90% for MD runs
of inactive OX1 and &gt;85% for inactive OX2. We observed that the
hydrophobic
triad of V3.40, L3.43, and F6.44 (defined
as present when the distance between the side chain carbon atoms of
V3.40, L3.43, and F6.44 is ≤4.5
Å) appears at a frequency of &gt;90% for MD runs of OX1 and OX2.
The loss of these interactions potentially has a negative effect on
the stability of the inactive state of OX receptors and may induce
activation due to the fact that F6.44 and Y6.48 are also part of the transmission switch. The transmission switch
includes a relocation of conserved residues, such as F6.44 and Y6.48, toward P5.50. This newly discovered and larger switch links the agonist binding
site with the movement of TM5 and TM6 through rearrangement of the
TM3–TM5–TM6 interface.

Conclusion
The
MD simulation protocol used in our work, followed by ensemble-flexible
docking, has gone beyond the use of static models and allowed for
a more detailed exploration of the OX structures. In this work, we
have demonstrated how these methods in combination with SDM data and
newly developed post-MD analysis tools can deal with the flexibility
of GPCRs to rationalize not only binding affinity but also the potency,
efficacy and selectivity of GPCR agonists. The MD simulations allow
the prediction of GPCR substates that is not possible with static
homology modeling alone.
