Lung
surfactant protein B (SP-B) is an essential protein found
in the surfactant fluid at the air–water interface of the lung.
Exposure to the air pollutant ozone could
potentially damage SP-B and lead to respiratory distress. We have
studied two peptides, one consisting of the N-terminus of SP-B [SP-B(1–25)] and the other a construct of the N- and C-termini
of SP-B
[SP-B(1–25,63–78)], called SMB. Exposure
to dilute levels of ozone (∼2
ppm) of monolayers of each peptide at the air–water interface
leads to a rapid reaction, which is evident from an increase
in the surface tension. Fluorescence experiments revealed that this
increase in surface tension is accompanied by a loss of fluorescence
from the tryptophan residue at the interface. Neutron and X-ray reflectivity
experiments show that, in contrast to suggestions in the literature,
the peptides are not solubilized upon oxidation but rather remain
at the interface with little change in their hydration. Analysis of
the product material reveals that no cleavage of the peptides occurs,
but a more hydrophobic product is slowly formed together with an increased
level of oligomerization. We attributed this to partial unfolding
of the peptides. Experiments conducted in the presence of phospholipids
reveal that the presence of the lipids does not prevent oxidation
of the peptides. Our results strongly suggest that exposure to low
levels of ozone gas will damage SP-B, leading to a change in its structure.
The implication is that the oxidized protein will be impaired in its
ability to interact at the air–water interface with negatively
charged phosphoglycerol lipids, thus compromising
what is thought to be its main biological function.

The air–water
interface
of the lung requires a layer of surfactant material to
prevent alveolar collapse.1 The exact composition
of the surfactant material at the interface varies between species
but contains mainly lipids, ∼90% by weight, and two hydrophobic
proteins, surfactant protein B (SP-B)
and surfactant protein C (SP-C), which make up the remaining 10%.2 A range of lipids
are required for correct respiratory function, and various types of
phospholipids constitute around 80% by weight of lung surfactant and
neutral lipids, mostly cholesterol, ∼10%. Approximately half
the total phospholipid present in humans is the saturated lipid 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC).3 However, the condition of premature infants, and animals, born with
an insufficiency of lung surfactant does not dramatically improve
if they are treated with a surfactant of pure DPPC, whereas treatment
with lipid mixtures or lipid/protein mixtures has been shown to be
very successful.4−7 The general consensus is that the other, mainly unsaturated, phospholipids
present such as 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) and its anionic analogue, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), are required to fluidize the otherwise
fairly rigid DPPC
monolayer and thus provide the required dynamical properties of the
interfacial layer.2 The two proteins directly
associated with the air–water interface, SP-B and SP-C, interact
with the lipids and are implicated
in the transfer of lipids to and retention of lipids at the interface.2 The presence of SP-B is vital for survival. Human
infants born, at full term, without a working version of SP-B due
to a genetic disorder do not survive.8−11 Mice with the SP-B gene deleted
from both chromosomes die within
days of birth.12 The presence of SP-C is
less crucial, but a lack of
SP-C is also linked to respiratory problems.13

Ozone is present as a secondary pollutant in ambient air.
It has
long been known that exposure to ozone, O3, leads to respiratory
problems, increased hospital admissions, and death.14−16 What is not
clear is the actual
mechanism, or mechanisms, by which ozone exposure leads to respiratory
problems. The surfactant at the air–water interface of the
lung is one of the first lines of defense when
humans are exposed to ozone present in ambient air. Several studies
have attempted to investigate the effect of short- and longer-term
ozone exposures in vivo on a pulmonary surfactant.
Müller and co-workers17 and Putman
and co-workers18 studied the surface tension
of lung surfactant retrieved from rats after exposure to 0.8 ppm ozone
for 2 and 12 h. The adsorption of the surfactant to the air–water
interface after exposure to ozone was significantly slower, and
the final surface tension reached was higher following exposure.

It is known that unsaturated lipids present at the air–water
interface will react readily with ozone.19−23 No reports
of the exposure of proteins SP-B and SP-C to ozone have been published,
but Kim et al. have reported a rapid reaction between
a peptide composed of the first 25 amino acids of SP-B, known as SP-B(1–25), at the air–water interface of an aqueous
droplet and high levels of gas-phase ozone.24 Kim et al. studied the products of the reaction using field-induced
droplet
ionization mass spectrometry and reported that the oxidized product
contained three more oxygen atoms than SP-B(1–25), which they deduced came from the oxidation of methionine
to methionine sulfoxide and tryptophan to N-formylkynrenine.
The signal-to-noise ratio for the product, SP-B(1–25) + 3O, was much lower than for the starting material, SP-B(1–25); hence, Kim
et al. suggest that the oxidized form of SP-B(1–25) may be lost entirely from the interface, rationalized by the
conversion of fairly hydrophobic residues into more hydrophilic species.

In this work, we have studied the effect of ozone exposure at the
air–water
interface on two truncated versions of SP-B, SP-B(1–25) and SP-B(1–25, 63–78), which is known
as Super Mini B (SMB).
SMB has been shown to better mimic the properties of full-length SP-B,
compared to SP-B(1–25), although both SP-B(1–25) and SMB improve lung function in surfactant deficient animal
models.25,26 The sequences of the full-length human protein
SP-B, SP-B(1–25), and SMB are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Primary structures of
the full-length human protein SP-B (UniProt
entry sp|P07988|201–279), N- and C-terminal construct SMB,
and N-terminal peptide SP-B(1–25).

The full-length protein SP-B is a small, 79-amino
acid residue,
8.7 kDa protein. Although hydrophobic, at physiological pH, it carries
a positive charge of ∼7, which is thought to be important for
selective interaction with negatively charged lipids such as phosphoglycerols.2 Peptides SMB and SP-B(1–25) carry positive charges of ∼7 and ∼4, respectively,
at physiological pH. The seven cysteine residues in SP-B are all involved
in disulfide bonds, three of which are intramolecular and the last
of which is intermolecular to another SP-B monomer. A crystal or NMR
structure of full-length protein SP-B has not yet been reported, but
circular dichroism and FTIR experiments reveal approximately 40–50%
α-helical content when in micelles and lipid bilayers.27,28 A recent review
by Olmeda et al. discusses the likely structure of SP-B
in lipid membranes based on sequence homology with other proteins
in the saposin family, all of which interact with lipids.29 Structural studies have been performed on the
peptide components of SP-B studied in this work, SP-B(1–25) and SMB. Gordon
et al. studied the structure of SP-B(1–25) in POPG
vesicles and found it to be predominantly α-helical;
Kurutz and Lee reported that the shorter peptide SP-B(11–25) dissolved in
methanol was α-helical, and Booth et al. studied
the structure of C-terminal segment SP-B(63–78) in
SDS micelles and found that it consisted of an amphipathic
helix.30−32 Shanmukh et
al. reported that the secondary structure of the monomeric
form of SP-B(1–25) at the air–water interface
depended upon the surrounding environment.33 The peptide had a predominantly α-helical
structure when present as a pure film, a predominantly β-sheet
secondary structure at the interface when present in 10 wt % mixtures
with 4:1 DPPC/DOPG lipid mixtures, where DOPG is the unsaturated
lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol,
but was predominantly α-helical when present at 1 wt % in a
4:1 DPPC/DOPG lipid mixture. Waring et al. and Sarker et al. studied
a short version of SMB, SP-B(8–25,63–78),
and found the structure was consistent with two linked amphipathic
α-helices and contained two intramolecular disulfide bonds.34,35 There have been a few neutron reflectometry studies of SP-B at the
air–water
interface36,37 and an X-ray reflectometry study
of SP-B(1–25) at the air–water interface,38 but no one has used these
methods to follow changes to SP-B upon its exposure to gas-phase ozone.

In this work, we have used a variety of analytical methods to study
the effects of exposure of SP-B(1–25) and SMB at
the air–water interface to low levels of gas-phase ozone. We
have investigated
the behavior of monolayers containing just the peptides and also mixed
monolayers containing both a peptide and a lipid component. The lipids
studied were the most abundant lung lipid, DPPC, and the anionic lipid
POPG. POPG was chosen as it is the most abundant anionic lipid in
adult human lung surfactant,39 and it is
believed that the interaction of SP-B with anionic lipids is important
for lung function.2 Although anionic lipids
in the lung are predominantly unsaturated,39 to selectively examine changes in the interaction of SMB to the
anionic headgroup of lipids upon oxidation of SMB we also performed
studies in which
SMB and the saturated anionic lipid DPPG were exposed to ozone.

Materials
and Methods
The SP-B(1–25) and SMB peptides
were supplied by Peptide Protein Research Ltd. The peptides were synthesized
using standard Fmoc chemistry with
a stated purity of &gt;98%. The SMB peptide was subjected to air oxidation
to produce the folded form with two internal disulfide bonds (Cys8–Cys49
and Cys11–CysC34), equivalent to the internal disulfides formed
by full-length SP-B, as reported previously.25 All lipids used were supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
AL). Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources and of ≥98%
purity. The chloroform was stabilized with 0.5–1% ethanol.

The reaction between gas-phase ozone and monolayers of SP-B(1–25) and SMB either as pure peptide films or as mixtures with phospholipids
at the air–water interface was studied under various conditions.
In general, monolayers
were prepared on an aqueous 50 mM, pH 7, sodium phosphate-buffered
subphase contained in a PTFE-lined Langmuir trough (Nima Technology)
housed in an environmental chamber to contain the ozone. The monolayers
were prepared by slowly adding solutions of the peptide, or the peptide/lipid
mixture, to the surface of the aqueous subphase using a Hamilton syringe.
The peptide solutions were prepared as 0.2 mg mL–1 peptide dissolved in a 5:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol solvent;
lipid mixtures were prepared as 1 mg mL–1 lipid
in chloroform. Binary mixtures of peptide and lipids
were prepared by mixing the required amounts of each solution. After
the addition of the peptide or peptide/lipid mixtures to the surface
of the subphase, the solvent was allowed to evaporate under a flow
of oxygen gas before the experiments were started. The experiments
were performed by continuously flowing a dilute (varied between ∼0.1
and 3 ppm) mixture of ozone in oxygen (BOC, ≥99.5%) at a constant
flow rate of 1 or 2 L min–1 through the chamber.
The ozone was generated by passing dry oxygen through a commercial
ozone generator (UVP) that generated ozone from the photolysis of
molecular oxygen.

Surface Pressure Measurements
The
surface pressure,
equal to the difference between the surface tension of the gas–water
interface of pure water and that of the interface under study, was
measured as the monolayer films of the peptides and peptide/lipid
mixtures were held at a constant area and exposure to gas-phase ozone.
The surface pressure was measured using a Wilhelmy plate made from
Whatman chromatography grade filter paper. Experimental constraints
meant that relatively low surface pressures (&lt;40 mN m–1) were used in all cases.

HPLC and SDS–PAGE Analysis
After exposure of
monolayers of SP-B(1–25) and SMB at the air–water
interface to ozone, the reaction products were recovered by extraction
with chloroform. The chloroform was then removed by using a rotary
evaporator, and then the product was dried under a flow of dry nitrogen
gas for several hours. The presence of cleaved peptide reaction products,
or other products, was investigated by performing (i) SDS–PAGE
analysis of the SP-B(1–25) samples and (ii) HPLC
analysis of both the SP-B(1–25) and SMB samples
recovered after reaction.

For the SDS–PAGE
experiments, the peptide material recovered following removal of the
chloroform was redissolved in 50 μL of a loading buffer [Tris
(pH 6.8) and 2% SDS with
0.1 M reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), when stated] and run on
a 18% acrylamide/bis(acrylamide) (19:1) resolving gel and a 5% (29:1)
stacking gel, with a tricine
buffer system as described by Schägger.40 After electrophoresis, the peptides were fixed using 5%
glutaraldehyde and the gel was stained using silver staining, which
revealed the position of the peptides in the gel.40 Bio-Rad Polypeptide SDS-PAGE Molecular Weight Standard
was prepared in the same loading buffer with DTT and loaded into the
gel to provide a molecular weight standard. A sample of the peptide
dissolved directly in the loading buffer was run for comparison with
material that had been extracted from the air–water interface.
A control run was performed where the trough was filled
with buffer only and treated with chloroform as described above. Extraction
and analysis of SP-B(1–25) monolayers in this way
were straightforward, and the results
are presented. However, SMB transfers less readily into the aqueous
SDS–PAGE buffer medium than SP-B(1–25), and
we were unable to obtain consistent transfer of the peptide
to the gel; thus, no results are presented.

For the HPLC analysis,
the material recovered after removal of
the chloroform was dissolved in a small quantity of ethanol. The material
extracted in this way was analyzed using HPLC with a C5 column (Jupiter
5 μm C5 300 Å, 250 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex) and solvent
of (i) ethanol and water [3:1 (w/w)] or (ii) propan-2-ol, both with
0.1%
trifluoracetic acid, with a gradient of 0 to 50% solvent ii over 40
min
with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min–1, and monitoring
the absorption of the eluent at 254 nm.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Measurements
Monolayers of
SMB were formed on an aqueous subphase contained in a plastic Petri
dish with a glass bottom (MatTek). Fluorescent lifetime images,
and maximal fluorescence intensities, were recorded using a setup
described previously.41 Briefly, a custom-built
two-photon microscope was constructed using scanning XY galvanometers
(GSI Lumonics Ltd.). A diode-pumped (Verdi V18) titanium sapphire
(Mira F900) operating
at 700–980
nm was used to pump an optical parametric oscillator (OPO,
APE-Coherent, GmbH, Berlin, Germany) to generate a laser wavelength
at 590 nm, with a pulse width of 180 fs and a repetition rate of 76
MHz. The laser beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot using
a water-immersion ultraviolet corrected objective (Nikon VC, 60×,
NA 1.2) and specimens were illuminated on the microscope stage of
a modified Nikon TE2000-U instrument with UV-transmitting optics.
The tryptophan residue of SMB was excited using two-photon excitation.
The intensity and lifetime of the emitted fluorescence light (∼380
nm) were recorded before and after the surface was exposed briefly
to a 3 ppm source of ozone, flowing at a rate of 1 L min–1.

Fluorescence emission was collected without descanning,
bypassing the scanning system, and passed through a narrowband interference
(UG11, Comar) filter used to isolate the UV light transmitted to the
photomultiplier. Emission fluorescence was detected using an external
fast microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R3809U-50)
and recorded using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC)
PC module SPC830 (Becker and Hickl GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Fluorescence
lifetime image microscopy was performed by synchronizing the XY galvanometer
positions with the fluorescence decay.

Neutron and X-ray Reflection
Measurements
Reflection
of neutrons and X-rays occurs where there is an interface between
two materials with different refractive indices for the respective
probe. The refractive index of a material to X-rays is related to
the number of electrons in the component atoms, whereas for neutrons,
the refractive index depends upon the nuclear properties of the particular
isotopes present. The reflected beam can be used to determine properties
such as the amount and thickness of the layer of material giving rise
to the reflection, as explained later. Further details of the use
of X-ray and neutron reflections to study monolayers at the air–water
interface can be found in recent reviews.42−44

The reflectivity
experiments
described here were performed by adding a monolayer film of either
pure peptide or a peptide/lipid mixture to an aqueous subphase. The
monolayer was compressed until the desired surface pressure was obtained;
then the area of the monolayer was held fixed, and the surface pressure
and reflectivity to neutrons or X-rays were monitored continuously,
first under a flow of pure oxygen and then under a dilute flow of
ozone in oxygen. The neutron reflectivity experiments with the pure
peptide monolayers were performed on the FIGARO reflectometer at the
Institut Laue-Langevin (Grenoble, France), whereas the experiments
involving the anionic lipids POPG and DPPG were performed on the SURF
reflectometer at ISIS, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (Harwell Oxford,
U.K.).45,46 The neutrons entered and exited the environmental
chamber via fused quartz windows. For experiments performed above
room temperature,
the windows were heated to prevent the condensation of water vapor.
The reflection of visible laser light at the interface was used to
check regularly the height alignment of the interface with respect
to the neutron beam. The incident neutron beam with a range of wavelengths,
λ (2.2–25 Å for FIGARO and 0.5–6.5 Å
for SURF), was collimated and inclined so that it fell at a grazing
angle of incidence, θ, of either 0.624° and 3.78°
(FIGARO) or 1.5° (SURF) to the horizontal plane of the air–liquid
interface. This provided neutron reflectivity data as a function
of momentum transfer normal to the interface, q,
where q = (4π/λ)
sin θ. The measured reflectivity of a sample of
pure D2O contained in the Langmuir trough was used to obtain
a scale factor with which to normalize the intensity spectrum of the
incident beam.

The X-ray reflectivity experiments were performed
on beamline I07
at Diamond Light Source.47 The X-rays had
a wavelength, λ, of ∼1.0 Å (12.5 keV), entered the
chamber via a mica window, and exited the chamber via a Kapton window.
A Pilatus area detector was used with regions of
interest defined for the reflected beam and the background. The incident
X-ray beam on I07 can be deflected to fall at a range of angles of
incidence to the air–liquid interface, allowing the reflectivity
to be measured as a function
of q. In this work, the reflectivity was recorded
between q values of 0.015 Å–1, below the critical edge where total reflection
occurs, and 0.8 Å–1. Beam damage to the sample
was avoided by the
use of a fast shutter that blocked the beam from reaching the sample
at all times other than when measurements were actually being made
and by regularly moving the beam footprint roughly 1 mm so that different
portions of the monolayer were being sampled over the course of an
experiment (several hours). Tests revealed that when using this procedure
no noticeable difference in the reflectivity was evident after several
hours for a film exposed to only a continuous flow of oxygen.

The reflectivity of an interface for X-rays depends upon the X-ray
scattering-length density of the material at the interface, the thickness
of the interfacial material, and, to a smaller extent, the wavelength
of the X-rays when near an absorption edge. The X-ray scattering-length
density of a molecule, ρe, is given byI where Zi values are the atomic numbers
of the individual nuclei in
the molecule (the sum is over all nuclei in the molecule), re is the classical radius of an electron, and V is the volume occupied by one molecule. The scattering-length
density of any material for X-rays is therefore positive and increases
with increasing electron density. The values of ∑iZire for the molecules considered in this work
are listed in Table 1. The benefits of isotopic substitution, so useful in neutron reflectometry,
as explained below, are not available as part of X-ray reflectometry;
however, X-ray sources are significantly more intense than neutron
source, and the technique gives lower background scattering, thus
allowing much lower values of reflectivity to be accurately determined.

The reflectivity of an interface for neutrons depends upon the
neutron scattering-length density and the thickness of the interfacial
material. The neutron scattering-length density, ρn, of a molecule is given by eq II:II where bn,i values are the coherent neutron scattering lengths of the
individual nuclei in the molecule, a property that is sensitive to
the nuclear composition (the sum is again over all nuclei in the molecule),
and V is again the volume occupied by one molecule.
As the coherent scattering lengths of hydrogen (−3.74 fm) and
deuterium (6.67 fm) are of opposite sign, a solution of
null reflecting buffered water (NRW) can be made with a mixture of
H2O and D2O that has a scattering length for
the mixture, ∑ibn,i, where the sum over all atoms in
the mixture is zero and consequently the scattering-length density,
ρn, of the mixture is zero. When a monolayer
of material is present on a NRW subphase, specular reflection of neutrons
occurs from the monolayer material only, and the product of the neutron
scattering-length density and the thickness of the observed layer
relates directly to the amount of material at the interface.44 A reduction in reflectivity from a monolayer
spread on NRW following reaction can be directly related to a loss
of material from the interface, e.g., through solubilization and/or
volatilization of material. In the case of neutrons, the difference
in sign of the scattering lengths of H and D means that the use of
different deuteration schemes can dramatically change the scattering
length of different isotopologues. The scattering lengths, ∑ibn,i, of the various molecules used in neutron reflection experiments
in this work are listed in Table 1. Peptides SP-B(1–25) and SMB both contain exchangeable
hydrogen atoms. When the peptides
were on a D2O subphase, 47 hydrogens were expected to exchange
for deuteriums in the case of SP-B(1–25) and 81 in the case
of SMB. When the peptides were on NRW buffer,
only 8% of these exchangeable hydrogen atoms would be expected to
be replaced by deuterium atoms.

Results
Exposure to gas-phase ozone of monolayers of SP-B(1–25), SMB, and mixed monolayers containing the peptides and lipids
leads to a rapid reaction of the monolayer, as revealed by surface
pressure measurements. Figure 2 shows the change in surface pressure when a monolayer of
SP-B(1–25) and a monolayer of SMB, at 37 °C,
is exposed to ∼1
ppm of gas-phase ozone.

Figure 2 Plot of surface pressure vs time when a monolayer
of pure SP-B(1–25) (black line) or SMB (red line)
is exposed to ∼1 ppm
gas-phase ozone. Data were recorded at 37 °C.

As shown in Figure 2, exposure to ozone causes a sharp
drop in surface pressure, corresponding to a rise in surface tension,
when monolayers of either SP-B(1–25) or SMB are
exposed to gas-phase ozone. The drop is more pronounced
in the case of SMB. The rapid drop in surface pressure is followed
by a much slower decline in surface pressure over many hours. Exposure
to ozone of monolayers of SP-B(1–25) and DPPC, or
SMB and DPPC, also leads to a rapid drop in surface
pressure, but the absolute reduction in surface pressure is less pronounced.
An example is shown in Figure 3 for the reaction of a 1:1 by weight
(∼1:6 by molecule) monolayer of SMB and DPPC. We have previously
shown that exposure of monolayers of pure DPPC to parts per million
levels of ozone does not lead to a change in the surface pressure.22

and DPPC, 1:6 by molecule, is exposed

The positively charged protein
SP-B is thought to be closely associated
with the negatively charged unsaturated lipid POPG in lung surfactant.
We have previously shown that the related unsaturated lipid POPC reacts
readily with ozone to give an initial rise in surface pressure, followed
by a slow fall.22,23 Neutron reflection studies with
POPC revealed that exposure to ozone led to a rapid loss of the terminal
C9 portion of the oleoyl chain from the interface and that this loss
was accompanied by an increase in surface pressure. It was therefore
suggested that the portion of the oxidized oleoyl tail still attached
to the lipid headgroup underwent a change in orientation and penetrated
the air–water interface, thus increasing the surface pressure,
a suggestion supported
by molecular dynamics simulations.23,48 In the work
presented here, the reaction of a monolayer of POPG with
gas-phase ozone was found to be similar to that of POPC. Figure 4 shows the changes
in surface pressure observed when a monolayer of POPG with an initial
surface pressure of ∼20 mN m–1 is exposed
to ozone.

Figure 4 Plot of surface pressure vs time when a monolayer of POPG (red
line) and a monolayer of SMB
and POPG, 1:12 by molecule (black line), is exposed to ∼2 ppm
gas-phase ozone.

As shown in Figure 4, exposure of a monolayer
of POPG to ozone causes a change in surface
pressure much more dramatic than that observed for monolayers of either
SP-B(1–25) or SMB (Figure 2). When a mixed monolayer of SMB and POPG
(1:12 by molecule) at the air–water interface is exposed to
ozone, a significant increase in surface
pressure is again seen, as shown by the black line in Figure 4, followed by a steady, slow
drop
in the surface pressure. In contrast to POPG, when the saturated anionic
lipid DPPG is exposed to ozone no change in surface pressure is observed,
as was previously reported for monolayers of the saturated zwitterionic
lipid DPPC, indicating that in the case of both DPPG and DPPC no reaction
with ozone has occurred. The change in surface pressure when a monolayer
of SMB and DPPG, 1:12 by molecule, is exposed to ozone is shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Plot of surface pressure
vs
time when a monolayer of SMB and [2H]DPPG, 1:12 by molecule,
is exposed to ∼2 ppm gas-phase ozone. Data were recorded at
room temperature.

As can been seen, when
SMB is present with DPPG, there is only
a slight decrease in the surface pressure when the monolayer is exposed
to ozone, compared to the case in which the monolayer is SMB only
(Figure 2) or SMB and
DPPC (Figure 3), suggesting
the anionic lipid DPPG
might be protecting the SMB to a greater extent than the zwitterionic
DPPC lipid. It should be remembered that DPPG is not present in significant
quantities in the lung, where the dominant PG lipids are all unsaturated.

In summary, exposure of monolayers of either of the two peptide
mimics of SP-B, SP-B(1–25), or SMB to ozone causes
a rapid drop in the surface pressure.
If the peptides are present in monolayers with lipids, then changes
in surface pressure suggest both reaction of the peptide and, if the
lipid is unsaturated, reaction of the lipid may occur.

A number
of residues in SP-B(1–25) and SMB can potentially
react with gas-phase ozone, when the
peptide is spread at the air–water interface, depending upon
the positioning of the peptide at the
interface.49 The fluorescence of the only
tryptophan residue in SMB, Trp9, gives a strong fluorescence signal
at the interface, as shown in Figure 6. The fluorescence intensity alone of a molecule is
insufficient to determine the environment of the molecule under observation
so that the determination of the excited state lifetime provides an
advantage. In the case of fluorescence from tryptophan in SMB at the
air–water
interface, the observed excited state lifetime has two components,
0.6 and 2.5 ns (weighted average of 0.9 ns), both shorter than the
2.8 ns lifetime generally observed for tryptophan, indicating that
the tryptophan in SMB at the air–water interface is in a complex
environment. Exposure to ∼3 ppm
ozone gas resulted in a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity and
prevented a detailed study of the changes in fluorescence lifetime
with exposure to be made in this work. After exposure to ∼3
ppm ozone for 10 min, no
discernible fluorescence could be detected from the sample using the
same excitation and emissions wavelengths. We can conclude that the
tryptophan residue in SP-B reacts rapidly with ozone on a time scale
comparable to that of the reaction that causes the rapid decrease
in surface pressure.

of SMB at
the air–water interface recorded using two-photon excitation
at 590 nm and monitoring
the fluorescence at 380 nm. The color scale shown on the right is
for the mean excited state lifetime. After exposure for 600 s to ∼3
ppm ozone in air, no fluorescence was detected.

Both X-ray and neutron reflection measurements were taken
to examine
the amount and thickness of peptide monolayers at the air–water
interface following exposure to gas-phase ozone of monolayers of
SP-B(1–25) and SMB on a buffered aqueous subphase.
The surface pressure
was recorded during these X-ray and neutron reflectometry experiments. Figure 7 shows reflectivity
data obtained for SP-B(1–25) on buffer before and
after exposure to ozone. Three scattering
contrasts are shown: that from X-rays and those from neutrons involving
two isotopic contrasts of the subphase (NRW and D2O). In
the case of X-rays, the presence of the peptide at the air–water
interface significantly changes the reflectivity profile from that
recorded for just the buffer alone. In the case of neutrons, the weak
reflectivity comes from the presence of the peptide at the interface
when spread on a NRW buffer, and the strong reflectivity of the subphase
is modified by the presence of the peptide at the interface when spread
on a D2O buffer.

ozone, pink
after, X-ray data recorded at 21 °C), D2O buffer (squares,
dark green before ozone, light green after, neutron data recorded
at 32 °C), and NRW buffer (circles, red before ozone, orange
after, neutron data recorded at 37 °C) before and after exposure
to ozone for 20400 s at ∼2 ppm (X-ray data), 9072 s at ∼1
ppm (neutron data with NRW), and
5769 s at ∼1 ppm (neutron data with D2O). The solid
lines represent
the fits to the data before ozone, as described in the text. The dash
light blue line represents the reflectivity to X-rays of a clean aqueous
buffer interface for reference. The inset shows the change in the
reflectivity before and after ozone, specifically
the difference between the logarithms of the reflectivity recorded
before and after ozone exposure.

The reflectivity data recorded before and after ozone are
almost
identical, with any differences appearing to be just random error
(see the inset in Figure 7), at least within the sensitivity of the instruments used.
The three reflectivity profiles were fitted simultaneously to determine
the characteristics of the peptide at the interface. The peptide film
can be modeled as two layers with part immersed in the aqueous subphase
and the top layer in air (see the Supporting Information for further details). The fits obtained,
which are shown in Figure 7, show that most of the SP-B(1–25), 88 ±
5%, lies above the water in a layer approximately
8 Å thick, with a highly hydrated thinner layer, ∼6 Å,
that lies in the aqueous subphase containing the remainder of the
peptide. The thickness of the hydrated layer and the fact that it
contains only a small amount of the peptide material are qualitatively
consistent with a model of the peptide as an α-helix on the
surface of the subphase with just the hydrophilic arginine
and lysine side chains extending into the subphase as a hydrated layer.
In all three cases, the reflectivity appears to be unchanged, within
experimental error, after prolonged exposure to ozone gas. Thus, although
the surface pressure data clearly show that the peptide
reacts with ozone, the reflectivity data reveal that the oxidized
material remains at the air–water interface, and there is no
evidence of deeper penetration into the
aqueous subphase upon prolonged exposure to ozone.

°C, initial surface pressure of 20 mN m–1),

pressure of 15 mN m–1), and NRW buffer (circles,
red before ozone, orange after,

mN m–1) before and after exposure to ozone for 9900
s at ∼2
ppm (X-ray), 29600 s at ∼1 ppm (neutron NRW data), and 30900
s at ∼1 ppm (neutron D2O data). The solid lines,
dashed blue line,
and inset are described in the legend of Figure 7.

The reaction of SMB with ozone also produced very little
change
in the X-ray and neutron reflectivity profiles of the interface, with
any differences in the reflectivity before and after ozone appearing
to be just random error, as shown in Figure 8. Simultaneous fitting of the combined X-ray
and neutron reflection data for SMB in the same way as described for
SP-B(1–25) reveals that the SMB is positioned at
the interface with 70
± 7% in a layer of thickness 7 Å above the water and the
remaining fraction in a hydrated 7 Å layer in the subphase. As
can be seen from Figure 8, the reaction of monolayers of SMB at the air–water interface
does not lead to any significant change in the neutron
or X-ray reflectivity profiles, whether the reaction was performed
at 21 °C or the more physiologically relevant temperature of
37
°C. Fitting the data recorded after exposure
of SMB to ozone reveals no changes, outside the uncertainty, in the
amount of material at the interface or the positioning of the peptide
at the interface. This is a surprising result as the fluorescence
data clearly show that the tryptophan residue of SMB is quickly oxidized
by ozone under these conditions and the reaction leads to a significant
change in the surface pressure.

The nature of the reaction products
that remain at the interface
was investigated by performing SDS–PAGE and HPLC analysis of
the reaction mixture extracted from the interface with chloroform,
as described above. Figure 9 shows a polyacrylamide gel of the extracted material from
a monolayer of SP-B(1–25) that has not been exposed
to ozone and also material that
has been exposed to ozone. The gel reveals that after oxidation with
ozone (∼3 ppm for 600 and 3600 s), the peptide still shows
a band in the same
place in the gel; i.e., no significant fragmentation of the peptide
chain has occurred as short products are not seen in the gel. Streaking
is evident in the gel for the samples that have been exposed to ozone,
and the extent of streaking increases with increasing exposure time.
The streaking reveals that, unlike the initial peptide, the oxidized
peptide recovered is not fully soluble in the SDS–PAGE aqueous
running buffer used.

Figure 9 SDS–PAGE gel showing SP-B(1–25) recovered from the air–water interface subject to oxygen
only, and after exposure to ∼3
ppm ozone gas for 10 and 60 min.

The band for SP-B(1–25) (mass of 2.9 kDa)
can be seen on the gel, as can a band for an oligomer of SP-B(1–25). The assignment of this band as an oligomer is
confirmed by
its absence when a sample of SP-B(1–25) is heated
with the reductant DTT before being loaded into
the gel (see Figure S2). In a different
series of experiments, the material recovered from the interface was
collected and concentrated in chloroform and then analyzed by HPLC.
The results are shown in Figure 10.

monolayers

SP-B(1–25) after exposure to ozone for 10 min (B),
and SP-B(1–25) after exposure to ozone for 60 min
(C). All peaks have been background subtracted and normalized to
the absorption, at 254 nm, of the SP-B(1–25) peak
at ∼6.5 min. Panel D shows the surface pressure vs time for
the monolayer immediately
before extraction with chloroform: no ozone (black line), after exposure
to ozone for 10 min (orange line), and after exposure to ozone for
60 min (red line).

The results shown in Figure 10 reinforce the
results obtained from the SDS–PAGE
experiment, that reaction of SP-B(1–25) with ozone
does not lead to the formation of any small hydrophilic
fragments, and the peptide itself is rendered more hydrophobic upon
oxidation, presumably via some structural change and/or formation
of higher-order oligomers.

In a similar series of experiments,
monolayers of SMB at the air–water interface were exposed to
gas-phase ozone and the oxidized material
was collected using chloroform as described previously. Figure 11 shows the chromatograms
obtained when a monolayer of SMB was extracted after exposure to oxygen
only, after exposure to ∼3 ppm ozone for 10 min, and after
exposure to ∼3 ppm ozone for 60 min. The absolute efficiency
of the extraction/recovery procedure is
variable, so the peaks have been normalized to the intensity of the
SMB peak.

Figure 11 HPLC data equivalent to those shown in the previous figure but
for SMB (see the legend of Figure 10 for details). The normalization
was conducted using the peak at ∼7.5 min.

Following exposure to ozone for 10 min, the surface pressure
of a monolayer of SMB has already dropped
sharply (see Figure 2); however, as shown in Figure 11, no new peak is
observed in the chromatograms, indicating that the product of the
initial reaction co-elutes with the starting material. After exposure
to ozone for 60 min, the intensity of a peak with a retention time
of ∼15 min, a retention time longer than that for SMB, has
significantly increased
compared to that of the SMB peak. This implies that a reaction product
is formed slowly and, as it is eluted after SMB under the reverse-phase
chromatographic conditions employed, this slow-forming product must
be more hydrophobic than the starting material SMB.

The experiments
described so far reveal that both SP-B(1–25) and
SMB are oxidized by low levels of ozone at the air–water
interface, which causes a significant change in the surface pressure,
yet the reaction products remain at the interface. A second set of
reflectivity measurements were taken on mixed monolayers of SMB and
anionic lipids to probe if oxidation of SMB changes its ability to
interact with the anionic lipids. The unsaturated anionic lipid POPG
has been shown to react with gas-phase ozone when present at the air–water
interface (Figure 4). The reflectivity to neutrons of a monolayer of d31-POPG on NRW decreases upon exposure to gas-phase ozone,
as shown in Figure 12. As the subphase is NRW buffer, this reduction in reflectivity can
be directly linked
to the loss of material from the monolayer, and a reduction in the
total value of the coherent neutron scattering length, bn, for the monolayer, as shown in the inset in Figure 12. The neutron reflectivity
data were
fitted using a model of a single lipid layer on NRW, allowing the
decrease in bn for the monolayer with
exposure time to ozone to be determined. This decrease in bn followed the form of a single-exponential
function shown in eq III:III The fit to eq III, shown by the solid
line in the inset in Figure 12, reveals
that the bn for the monolayer falls to
67 ± 2% of the initial value. As the bn value for the monolayer is dominated by the contribution from the
deuterated palmitoyl chain of d31-POPG,
this reduction in bn is interpreted as
a loss of deuterated material from the interface.

Figure 12 Neutron reflectivity
profiles obtained at different exposure times
when a monolayer of d31-POPG on NRW at
room temperature is exposed to ∼3 ppm gas-phase ozone: t = 0 × 103 s (red circles), t = 2 × 103 s (orange circles), t = 4 × 103 s (yellow circles), t = 7 × 103 s (green circles), t =
10 × 103 s (blue circles), and t =
18 × 103 s (gray circles). The inset shows the relative
decrease in the coherent neutron scattering length, bn, for the monolayer material with time.

Exposure of a monolayer of SMB and d31-POPG (1:12 by molecule) to ozone has been shown to
lead to a rapid
reaction (see Figure 4). The neutron reflectivity of this
SMB and d31-POPG monolayer on NRW is dominated
by the d31-POPG as d31-POPG molecules contribute 83% of the total initial bn value for the monolayer (81% of the overall
scattering-length density). The neutron reflectivity for the SMB/d31-POPG monolayer on NRW was therefore modeled
as a single layer on NRW, similar to that of the pure lipid monolayer.
Exposure of the monolayer to gas-phase ozone leads to a rapid drop
in the reflectivity of the monolayer and the total bn value for the monolayer, as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13 Neutron reflectivity
profiles obtained at different exposure times
when a monolayer SMB and d31-POPG (1:12
by molecule) on NRW at room temperature is exposed to ∼3 ppm
gas-phase ozone: t = 0 s (red circles), t = 2 × 103 s (orange circles), t = 4 × 103 s (yellow circles), t = 7 × 103 s (green circles), t =
10 × 103 s (blue circles), and t =
18 × 103 s (violet circles). The inset shows the relative
decrease in the coherent neutron scattering length, bn, for the monolayer material with time, and
the solid line is obtained by fitting bn to a single-exponential decay.

Figure 13 shows
that the reflectivity of the monolayer of SMB and d31-POPG to neutrons decreases upon exposure of the monolayer
to ozone gas and indicates that material is being lost from the monolayer
and the total b value for the monolayer decreased
upon exposure to ozone. Fitting the decrease in b for the monolayer to an exponential function (eq III) reveals that the final monolayer
has a b value that is 62 ± 1% of the initial
value for the monolayer. This is, surprisingly, slightly
less than the value obtained when just d31-POPG is present, without SMB, at the interface. A decrease in total bn to ∼73% of the initial value would
be expected for the mixed monolayer if just material from d31-POPG were lost from the interface (no loss
of SMB) and the loss of material from POPG were not influenced by
the presence of the SMB. It is not possible to determine, from the
data recorded, whether the additional loss of material is due to the
loss of more POPG from the interface when SMB is present or whether
the presence of POPG causes some SMB to be lost from the interface
upon oxidation. Further experiments in the future, with a deuterated
version of SMB, would be required to answer this question. To examine
selectively changes upon oxidation of SMB to interactions with the
anionic headgroup of POPG, we also performed neutron reflectivity
studies in which
mixtures of SMB and the saturated anionic lipid d62-DPPG, 1:12 by molecule, on NRW buffer were exposed
to ozone. The changes in surface pressure for this mixture are presented
in Figure 5. There
was no measurable reduction in the neutron reflectivity; thus, we
can conclude that
oxidation of SMB does not lead to a loss of d62-DPPG from the interface (shown in Figure S3). X-ray reflectivity experiments (also Figure S3) revealed that when mixtures of SMB and DPPG (1:12
by molecule) on aqueous buffer were exposed to ozone for several hours
the slight change in surface pressure was not accompanied by a significant
change in the reflectivity of the interface. These data thus show
that the small change in surface pressure when SMB/DPPG monolayers
are exposed to ozone is not accompanied by significant loss of material
from the interface or a measurable structural change.

Discussion
The surface pressure results presented here for both peptide mimics
of SP-B, SP-B(1–25) and SMB, clearly reveal that,
at the relatively modest initial
surface pressures considered in this work, exposure of the peptides
to ozone at the air–water interface causes a rapid reaction
leading to a reduction in surface
pressure, corresponding to an increase in surface tension. As the
peptides contain only residues found in full-length SP-B, we can conclude
that SP-B will also react rapidly with ozone. At the air–water
interface of the lung, SP-B will be surrounded by lipids. The most
abundant lipid is DPPC. The surface pressure data show that both peptides
also react with ozone when it is present with DPPC at the air–water
interface. The reaction is less pronounced, but still occurs, when
the anionic lipid DPPG is used in place of DPPC. The extent to which
the presence of anionic lipids might offer some protection to SP-B
in the lung is, however, uncertain as the anionic lipids found in
the lung are not saturated lipids such as DPPG but rather unsaturated
lipids
such as POPG. As we have shown here, the unsaturated anionic lipid
POPG itself reacts rapidly with ozone. This reaction may weaken the
ability of POPG to hinder the reaction of ozone with SP-B. Kim et
al.24 have previously
shown that both SP-B(1–25) and the neutral, unsaturated
lipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol (POG), react
with ozone when both are present
at the air–water interface. Future studies of the reaction
of ozone with monolayers
of SP-B in the presence of the complex lipid mixtures found in natural
lung surfactant are necessary to address this question. It would also
be interesting to follow the extent of reaction of SP-B as a function
of initial surface tension, as surface tensions present in the lung
are lower than those studied here and the shielding of SP-B from the
gas-phase ozone may be different.

As mentioned previously, Kim
et
al. found that SP-B(1–25) reacted with high levels
of ozone when the peptide was at
the air–water interface.24 Tryptophan
and methionine reacted, whereas cysteine residues did not. This is
in contrast to the finding of Enami et al., who studied
the reaction of free cysteine and ozone at the air–water interface
and found that cysteine sulfenate, cysteine sulfinate,
and cysteine sulfonate were all formed, whereas cystine was not.50 In this work, the peptide SMB is shown to react
with ozone at a rate very similar to that of SP-B(1–25). In SMB, unlike SP-B(1–25), all the initial cysteine
residues have been converted into
cystine, which is not thought to react with ozone.50,51 Both SP-B(1–25) and SMB have one tryptophan residue; however,
SMB has two methionine
residues, whereas SP-B(1–25) has only one. The results
from our fluorescence experiments
clearly show that the rapid drop in surface pressure seen when SMB
is exposed to ozone is accompanied by the rapid loss in fluorescence
from tryptophan residues at the interface. The most likely reason
for this is the tryptophan residues are oxidized rapidly when peptide
SMB is exposed to ozone at the air–water interface. The slightly
more pronounced drop in surface pressure
when SMB is exposed to ozone compared to SP-B(1–25) can be attributed to a larger structural change upon oxidation
of the tryptophan residues or the presence of an additional methionine
residue that is oxidized in SMB compared to SP-B(1–25).

The results of our work are in agreement with those of Kim
et
al.24 in that peptide
SP-B(1–25) reacts rapidly with ozone at the air–water
interface. In addition, we have shown the reaction occurs when ozone
concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those used by Kim
et
al. are
used. Our results do not support the suggestion by Kim et al. that
the oxidation of SP-B(1–25) at the air–water
interface by ozone leads to enhanced solubility of the peptide and
deeper penetration into the aqueous layer. The neutron reflection
experiments with NRW buffer
and the X-ray reflection experiments on buffered water together clearly
show that the oxidized peptide remains at the interface and is not
solubilized, and that there are no measurable structural changes in
the monolayer. The neutron reflection experiments
using a buffered D2O subphase are specifically sensitive
to the degree of penetration of the peptide into the aqueous layer,
and oxidation is seen to make no measurable change in this degree
of penetration (see Figure 7). This result requires some thought
as the oxidation of tryptophan by ozone to N′-formylkynurenine
(see Scheme 1) and
the oxidation of methionine
to methionine sulfoxide do increase the hydrophilicity of these two
residues (oxidation of the cysteine residues would also increase the
hydrophilicity if it is occurring). The tryptophan, residue 9 of the
peptide, and the methionine, residue 21, are positioned at either
end of the α-helical region of SP-B(1–25).
Sarker et
al. have previously shown that replacement of tryptophan
in SP-B(8–25) with the oxidized form, kynurenine
(see Scheme 1), leads
to a loss of helical character
and a change in the interaction of the peptide with lipids.52 It would be reasonable to assume that oxidation
of tryptophan to N-formylkynrenine would also lead
to a loss of helical character. There are many examples in the literature
to show that oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide leads
to changes in protein structure and stability (e.g., ref (53)). A reduction
in the level of secondary structure of the peptides is consistent
with the results from our reverse-phase HPLC experiments. The material
extracted after oxidation shows that there is slow formation of a
product material with a longer retention time and, hence, a substance
more hydrophobic than the starting material. The formation of the
more hydrophobic substance is much slower than the initial oxidation
of the tryptophan residue, in keeping with the idea that the peptide
containing the oxidized tryptophan, possibly methionine, residue undergoes
a slow conformational change. The SDS–PAGE results reveal that
peptide SP-B(1–25) is not cleaved following exposure
to ozone; rather, ozone
exposure leads to more oligomerization of the peptide, and the streaking
observed in the gel for the oxidized sample is consistent with the
peptide being less soluble in aqueous media following oxidation. Thus,
in the case of SP-B(1–25), we see that the peptide
reacts rapidly with low levels of
ozone at the air–water interface and the oxidation does not
lead to solubilization of the
peptide from the interface. On the other hand, the oxidized material
remains at the interface and undergoes substantial conformational
changes, leading to a more hydrophobic product and an increased level
of oligomerization. The X-ray and neutron reflectivity data show no
significant differences after exposure to ozone; that is, the fraction
of the peptide in the hydrophobic layer above the water and the fraction
in the hydrated aqueous layer does not change upon oxidation within
the precision of the measurements. This behavior is in keeping with
our earlier suggestion that the peptide material in the hydrated layer
is essentially just the hydrophilic arginine and lysine chains that
are unchanged by oxidation. The rearrangement of the protein occurs
in the already hydrophobic layer in the air, which becomes more hydrophobic
upon exposure to ozone. In the case of exposure of SMB to ozone, again
the slow growth of a peak in the HPLC analysis at a longer retention
time to the initial material is consistent with a major conformational
change in the peptide following ozone oxidation. It should be noted
that the results presented here show that no cleavage of the peptide
chain has occurred upon exposure to ozone, which is similar to what
has previously been shown when other soluble proteins are exposed
to ozone in aqueous solutions.54

The structure of
kynurenine
is shown below.

In addition to studies of
the pure peptides at the air–water interface, we have also
undertaken studies of the peptides when
they are present in lipid monolayers. The surface pressure measurements
show that the main lung lipids do not shield the peptides from the
ozone gas. A rapid drop in surface pressure occurs when both SMB and
SP-B(1–25) in monolayers of the lipid DPPC are exposed
to ozone. The
lipid DPPC does not react with ozone. When SMB is present in monolayers
with the unsaturated anionic lipid POPG, a rapid reaction of the lipid
is clearly observed, and more material is lost from the interface
than if just the lipid POPG were present. However, it is not possible
to determine if the additional material lost is of lipid or peptide
origin. The role of protein SP-B is thought to be to interact with
unsaturated anionic lipids such as POPG, possibly by binding to the
lipids and bringing them back to the interface as the lungs expand.
The interaction is thought to be facilitated by the presence of several
positively charged residues in SP-B. Looking at the experimentally
determined structure of Mini-B, SP-B(8–25,63–78), PDB
entry 1SSZ,
shown in Figure 14, it can
be seen that the positively charged arginine residue (residue 8 of
Mini-B) is very close to the tryptophan, residue 2 of Mini-B. Oxidation
of the tryptophan residue by ozone at the air–water interface
has been shown in this work to occur and lead to a conformational
change in the peptide, likely to include partial unwinding of the
α-helix.
Considering the structure shown in Figure 14, it is reasonable to conclude that
this change in conformation is likely to affect the binding of anionic
lipids to the arginine nearby. In future work, we will go on to look
further at the interaction of oxidized SP-B with anionic lipids.

Figure 14 Structure
of SP-B(8–25,63–78), known as Mini-B, PDB
entry 1SSZ.
The tryptophan residue is colored blue, and all positively charged
amino acids, thought to interact with negatively charged phosphoglycerol
lipids, are colored red. The disulfide bonds between the cysteine
residues are colored yellow. Oxidation of the tryptophan is suggested
to lead to local unwinding of the helical structure close to at least
one of the arginine residues, potentially interfering with lipid binding.

Conclusions
In this work, we have
shown that two peptide mimics of the lung
surfactant protein B, SP-B, react rapidly with low levels of the environmental
pollutant gas-phase ozone when they are present at the air–water
interface. The rapid reaction is evident from a change in the surface
tension of the interface and loss of tryptophan fluorescence. The
presence of lipids does not appear to shield the peptides from the
ozone gas. The rapid oxidation of the peptides is followed by a slow
conformational change leading to a product that is more hydrophobic
than the starting material. The oxidized peptides remain at the interface
after the reaction, but examination of the interfacial structures
suggests that interaction with anionic lipids will be impaired. As
full-length protein SP-B also contains the same residues as the peptide
mimics studied here, we can conclude that inhalation of ozone will
lead to oxidation of vital lung protein SP-B, leaving a damaged protein
at the interface.
