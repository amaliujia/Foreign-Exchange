The
human telomere plays crucial roles in maintaining genome stability.
In the presence of suitable cations, the repetitive 5′-TTAGGG-3′
human telomere sequence can fold into G-quadruplexes that adopt the
hybrid, basket, or propeller fold. The telomere sequence is hypersensitive
to UV-induced thymine dimer (T=T) formation, yet it does not cause
telomere shortening. In this work, the potential structural disruption
and thermodynamic stability of the T=T-containing natural telomere
sequences were studied to understand why this damage is tolerated
in telomeres. First, established methods, such as thermal melting
measurements, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and circular
dichroism spectroscopy, were utilized to determine the effects of
the damage on these structures. Second, a single-molecule ion channel
recording technique using α-hemolysin (α-HL) was employed
to examine further the structural differences between the damaged
sequences. It was observed that the damage caused slightly lower thermal
stabilities and subtle changes in the circular dichroism spectra for
hybrid and basket folds. The α-HL experiments determined that
T=Ts disrupt double-chain reversal loop formation but are tolerated
in edgewise and diagonal loops. The largest change was observed for
the T=T-containing natural telomere sequence when the propeller fold
(all double-chain reversal loops) was studied. On the basis of the
α-HL experiments, it was determined that a triplexlike structure
exists under conditions that favor a propeller structure. The biological
significance of these observations is discussed.

Telomeres
are DNA–protein
complexes that are essential to maintaining genome integrity.1 Human telomere DNA consists of a 5′-(TTAGGG)n-3′ repetitive sequence that is 5000–20000
bp long with a 3′ single-stranded overhang of 100–250
bases.2,3 This guanine (G)-rich single-stranded DNA
(ssDNA) sequence can form G-quadruplex structures that were recently
validated in human cells.4 The building
unit of a G-quadruplex is a G-quartet that consists of four planar
Gs that are hydrogen-bonded through the Hoogsteen face.5 These alternative DNA secondary structures are
proposed to play an important role in DNA recombination, transcription,
and replication.6−9 The ends of chromosomes are capped by telomeres to prevent fusion
of the uncapped end of a chromosome with another telomere or a double-strand
break and to prevent nucleolytic resectioning.10,11 Understanding the secondary structure of G-quadruplexes is a key
step to addressing their role in biological processes.

G-Quadruplexes
can assume several different structures that are
dependent upon the alkali metal ion (K+ or Na+) coordinated, the physical conditions of the solution, and the sequence.
In a KCl solution, the human telomere sequence (hTelo) adopts two
interchangeable structures termed hybrid 1 and hybrid 2 that display
two edgewise loops and one double-chain reversal loop.12−14 The main difference between these
hybrid folds is the order of the loops, in which hybrid 1 has the
double-chain reversal loop closest to the 5′ end and hybrid
2 has it closest to the 3′ end (Figure 1a). The basket fold occurs in a NaCl solution, and it contains two
edgewise loops and one central diagonal loop (Figure 1a).15 A third topology has been
characterized and termed the propeller fold; it has been observed
in highly dehydrating solutions or in solid-state experiments.16−18 The propeller fold is formed
in the presence of K+ and contains only double-chain reversal
loops (Figure 1a);16,17,19 it is also commonly observed in various
promoter sequences that are capable of G-quadruplex formation.20 On the basis of the higher concentration of
K+ inside the cell,21 and the
higher G-quadruplex binding constant for binding to K+ versus
Na+, the hybrid folds are the G-quadruplex conformations
that were proposed to exist in vivo for hTelo,13,22,23 and the folding pattern that
it assumes is crucial for its proper function in the cell.24,25

then a voltage was applied across the channel. Current levels were
measured when G-quadruplexes were captured in the vestibule.

The telomere sequence is hypersensitive
to oxidative and UV-induced
DNA damage that can alter its folding pattern.27−29 Oxidative stress
is a known contributor
to telomere shortening that is directly associated with cell mortality
and aging.30−32 Guanine (G) is the most oxidation-prone
DNA base because of its low redox potential;33,34 consequently, the G-rich telomere sequence is hypersensitive to
oxidative DNA damage,28,35 and indeed, the majority of the
G oxidation products were found to be present in the human telomere
sequence.35 Surprisingly, even though the
damage disturbs the core of the G-quadruplex structure (G-tetrads),
it still can maintain some degree of secondary structure, depending
on the location of the damage.35−37 In contrast to the core damage,
DNA lesions found in the loops of G-quadruplex folds are well tolerated.
Thymine glycol and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyadenosine (8-oxo-A)
present in the loops of hybrid and basket G-quadruplexes did not prevent
folding, yielding similar structures.36,38 Interestingly,
the stabilities of these structures were dependent on the nature of
the damage.36,38

Another type of persistent
DNA damage is UV-induced photo-cross-linking of two adjacent thymine
(T) residues resulting in the formation
of cis,syn-thymine dimers [T=T (Scheme 1)].39 The native human
telomere sequence is perfectly poised for T=T formation. This damage
is readily formed in the epidermis and correlates with skin cancer;40 in addition, model studies of UV damage to cells
identified the telomere to be hypersensitive to formation of T=Ts.27 Moreover, T=Ts in the telomeres were shown not
to increase the level of shortening, and these cells did not show
increased rates of apoptosis.27 These results
suggest that T=Ts are not detrimental to telomere structure and function.
Despite the fact that the telomere region is hypersensitive to UV
light-induced DNA damage,27 few studies
have been conducted on the effects of T=T in G-quadruplexes. An in vitro study conducted by Taylor’s laboratory showed
the hybrid folds can be UV-irradiated to form T=Ts.41,42

Scheme 1 Two Adjacent Ts Are Converted to a cis,syn-Thymine Dimer (T=T) upon UV Irradiation
In this work, we investigated the stability and structure
of T=T-containing
G-quadruplexes to address the question how UV-induced damage affects
human telomere G-quadruplex structure. These studies included established
methods of analysis (circular dichroism, electrophoretic mobility
shift assay, and thermal melting), as well as a new single-molecule
method developed in our laboratory.43,44 In this method,
a single α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore was used to capture
the different G-quadruplexes in the vestibule under an electrophoretic
force. During the capture event, the recorded ion current gives characteristic
patterns based on the G-quadruplex fold that was captured in the vestibule
(Figure 1b).

Materials and
Methods
DNA Preparation and Purification
The oligodeoxynucleotides
(ODNs) were synthesized at the DNA/Peptide Core Facility at the University
of Utah using commercially available phosphoramidites (Glen Research).
The ODNs were then deprotected45 and purified
via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following standard
protocols that are further explained in the Supporting
Information (Experimental and Figure S1) .

Circular Dichroism
(CD) and Tm Study
To induce the
hybrid folds, a 950 mM LiCl, 50 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris,
1 mM EDTA, pH 7.9 solution was used; the basket folds were induced
with a 1 M NaCl, 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.9 solution, and the propeller
fold was induced with a 5 M LiCl, 20 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 7.9 solution. The ODNs were annealed by first heating the samples
to 90 °C and
then cooling them to room temperature over 4 h; next, the samples
were stored at 4 °C for 2 days. The thermal denaturation studies
were conducted by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 295
nm for basket and hybrid folds and at 260 nm for the propeller folds.
The CD profiles were recorded on 20 μM samples at 20 °C
in each of the salts described above. Plots of molar ellipticity were
achieved using an ε260 of 0.2805 L μM–1 cm–1 for the native sequence and an ε260 of 0.2637 L μM–1 cm–1 for the T=T-containing sequences. The different values reflect
the fact that T=T does not absorb light at 260 nm.

Current Time
Recordings
The ion channel recordings
were conducted with a custom-built amplifier and data acquisition
system designed by Electronic BioSciences (EBS, San Diego, CA). The
glass nanopore membrane (GNM) was fabricated using previously established
procedures.46,47 The data were
collected at 21 ± 1 °C using a 500 kHz sampling
rate and 100 kHz low-pass filter; however, for the purpose of presentation,
the data were refiltered to 20 kHz. The data were then analyzed using
QUB 1.5.0.31 and fit
using OriginPro 9.1. For each ODN, three voltages were studied, 120,
140, and 160 mV (trans vs cis).
For each voltage, roughly 1000 events were
collected.

Results
Characterization of Thymine
Dimer-Containing G-Quadruplexes
Using Conventional Methods
The T=T-containing human telomere
sequences chosen for the study were synthesized from commercially
available phosphoramidites. The T=T was introduced at one of three
places along the truncated native sequence of the human telomere sequence
that could fold into a single G-quadruplex possessing a tail at both
ends comprised of two nucleotides (Table 1).
CD spectroscopy, thermal denaturation studies (Tm), and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were
conducted on each sequence under the following high-ionic strength
conditions, which are required to conduct the ion channel recordings
in the α-HL nanopore:43,44 (1) 50 mM KCl and 950
mM LiCl (hybrid folds), (2) 1 M NaCl (basket folds), or (3) 20 mM
KCl with 5 M LiCl (propeller folds). All samples were in 25 mM Tris
(pH 7.9) with 1 mM EDTA. The 5 M LiCl solution was previously shown
by our laboratory to induce the propeller fold because of its dehydrating
effect.44 These data were compared to those
collected under low-ionic strength conditions in the following salts:
(1) 140 mM KCl and (2) 140 mM NaCl in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).

First, CD measurements were conducted
for the natural sequence
under the three different high-ionic strength salt conditions. The
natural telomere sequence gave data that were consistent with literature
reports (Figure 2).48 Next, the T=T-containing G-quadruplexes were tested and found to
give characteristic antiparallel (hybrid and basket) signatures with
positive peaks at ∼290 nm (Figure 2a,b).
Additionally, the hybrid folds featured a characteristic shoulder
at 265 nm and a negative peak at 240 nm (Figure 2a). The basket fold featured an additional positive peak at ∼240
nm and a trough at ∼265 nm (Figure 2b). These data led to the conclusion that the T=T-containing ODNs
fold to the hybrid and basket topologies in the presence of K+ and Na+, respectively. As verification that the
high-ionic strength conditions do not change the folding patterns,
these data were compared to CD data that were obtained at a relevant
ionic strength of 140 mM. The data look the same between the two different
salt concentrations (Figure S7 of the Supporting
Information). This is interpreted to mean that the high ionic
strength does not change the overall structure of the quadruplexes.
In contrast to the antiparallel folds, the propeller fold (parallel
stranded) featured an intense peak at ∼264 nm and a negative
peak at 240 nm. The T=T-containing ODNs were shifted by ∼5
nm toward shorter wavelengths compared to the natural sequence (Figure 2c). These data suggest that the T=T-containing human
telomere sequence adopted a fold slightly different from the propeller
fold in high molar concentrations of LiCl (5 M). The recorded CD spectra
for these lesion-bearing G-quadruplexes were similar to the CD spectrum
reported for the triplex folding sequence 5′-TTA(GGGTTA)3-3′.18,49,50 However, these data did not allow us to further confirm this observation.

of the human telomeric G-quadruplexes. The sequences are color coded
as follows: blue for T=T in the 5′ loop, red for T=T in the
middle loop (M T=T), green for T=T in the 3′ loop of the quadruplex,
and black

native sequence. (a) Hybrid fold: annealed in a 950 mM
LiCl, 50 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.9 solution. (b) Basket

(c) Propeller fold: annealed in a 5 M LiCl, 20 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris,
1 mM EDTA, pH 7.9 solution.

Next, we examined the thermal stability of T=T-containing
ODNs
by monitoring the UV–vis absorption spectral change as a function
of increased temperature.
The Tm of each fold is reported in Table 2, and representative Tm curves are included in Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information. In a KCl solution that induces the hybrid fold,
the T=T-containing ODNs showed Tm values
(ΔTm ∼ −4
°C) slightly lower than that of the native sequence,
indicating that the presence of T=T only slightly destabilized the
structure. Similarly, in a NaCl solution that gives the basket fold,
the T=T-containing strands had Tm values
(ΔTm ∼ −4
°C) slightly lower than that of the native sequence,
again indicating the slightly lower stability of the damage-containing
G-quadruplexes. In the solution that induces the propeller fold, the Tm values were dependent on the location of the
T=T. The largest decrease in Tm (ΔTm ∼ −10
°C) was observed when the T=T was positioned in the
middle loop of a propeller fold; when the T=T was positioned in either
the 5′ or 3′ loop, the Tm was slightly lower than that of the native sequence (ΔTm ∼ −5 °C).

Finally, we conducted EMSA experiments in NaCl or
KCl to further
support the ability of T=T-containing telomere sequences to fold into
G-quadruplex structures (Figure S2 of the Supporting
Information). All T=T-containing strands migrated approximately
the same distance as the natural sequence. This experiment could not
be performed for the propeller fold because of the 5 M LiCl that was
required to induce this topology. The methods mentioned so far indicate
that the T=T-containing human telomere sequences folded into G-quadruplexes
are slightly less stable than the undamaged ODNs in the presence of
K+ and Na+. The CD spectra for the damaged G-quadruplexes
in KCl and NaCl lead to minor changes, suggesting that incorporation
of
T=T into the loops does not dramatically alter the quadruplex folds.
Lastly, in 5 M LiCl, the human telomere sequence assumes a propeller
fold; however, the damage-containing ODNs presented subtle perturbations
to the CD spectra that are challenging to interpret by these methods.
To gain more insight into the structural differences between the damage-containing
folds, a single-molecule experiment was conducted with the α-HL
ion channel. This method has been recently developed in our laboratory
to discriminate different topologies of G-quadruplexes.43,44 Furthermore, the technique provides population information about
an equilibrating mixture of species in solution.

Single-Molecule
Analysis of the Thymine Dimer-Containing G-Quadruplexes
The
nanopore recordings were conducted according to previously
established procedures from the White laboratory.46,47 Briefly, the wild-type α-HL nanopore was assembled from monomers
into a lipid bilayer that was painted across a glass nanopore membrane.
A voltage was applied across the membrane, and the DNA was electrophoretically
driven toward the cis side of the α-HL (Figure 1b). Different G-quadruplex folds can yield unique
current signatures by interacting differently with the α-HL
nanocavity.43,44 We took advantage of this system
to understand the folding patterns of T=T-containing G-quadruplexes
in the three different salt solutions.

The T=T’s effect
on the G-quadruplex folds was interpreted by comparison to our recent
results.43 Previously, when the G-quadruplexes
in a KCl solution interact with the vestibule of α-HL, three
unique ion–current patterns were observed. The ion–current
patterns corresponding to the hybrid 1 and 2 folds were determined
by reinforcing a single hybrid fold with 8-bromo-2′-deoxyguanosine,
which forces G to adopt the syn conformation. In
these studies, event types that corresponded to the hybrid 1 and hybrid
2 folds were uniquely identified. The third ion–current pattern
was determined to be a triplexlike fold based on comparison to current
patterns from a control strand that has three G runs and yields only
a triplexlike fold. From these results, it was determined that the
native telomere sequence exists in a hybrid 1:hybrid 2:triplexlike
ratio of 11:5:1 ratio. These previous studies allowed us to compare
ion–current patterns when T=T was placed in a loop to those
from the native structures.

Hybrid Folds
First, the native sequence
was studied
under conditions that yield the hybrid folded G-quadruplex. In the
presence of K+, entry of the G-quadruplex folds produced
three different event types. They represent the hybrid folds, loop
entry (shallow blockage only, no translocation) and triplexlike folds,
similar to the results of our previous report (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information).43 In our previous studies, these event types were demonstrated to
enter the nanopore with different frequencies based on their shape;
therefore, correction factors for this event frequency bias were applied
to the current data, in which the hybrid 1, hybrid 2, and triplexlike
intermediate had relative event frequencies of 1.1, 1.0, and 6.2,
respectively.43 To briefly reiterate, the
major event types observed were characteristic of the hybrid folds
[∼75% (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information)]. These events gave different current signatures that oscillated
between a deep current level (I) and a midcurrent
level [IM (Figure 3a)]. Furthermore, the midcurrent levels were distinct and assigned
as hybrid 1 (IM/I0 = 37 ± 3%) and hybrid
2 (IM/I0 =
44 ± 4%) on the basis of our previous work.43 Hybrid 1 was shown to be more abundant than
hybrid 2 with a ratio of approximately 2:1. The statistical analysis
of the event types corresponding to hybrid 1 and hybrid 2 is presented
in Figure 3b. Second, current signatures for
the loop entry were analyzed and corresponded
to ∼20% of the event types, while event types for the triplexlike
fold represented ∼5% of the population. Only the triplexlike
folded structures were able to unravel and translocate the narrow
β-barrel of the ion channel; the hybrid G-quadruplexes were
too stable inside the nanocavity of α-HL to unfold on the millisecond
time frame of the analysis, and they eventually exited from the cis side of the protein vestibule by diffusional motion.

The G-quadruplexes that contained UV-induced damage in the 3′
loop, middle loop, or the 5′ loop presented three types of
ion–current events that were similar to that of the native
sequence. The hybrid event types were slightly less frequent [60–70%
(Figure
S3 of the Supporting Information)] than
that observed for the undamaged G-quadruplex. Hybrid 1 and
2 distributions for the ODNs containing the T=T at the 3′ loop
and the middle loop gave a similar 2:1 ratio, as observed in the native
sequence. This observation is interpreted to say that incorporation
of T=T into the 3′ or middle loops of a hybrid quadruplex does
not alter the hybrid structural distribution. The presence of the
T=T in the 5′ loop of the G-quadruplex caused a shift in the
hybrid 1 and 2 equilibrium that favored hybrid 2 (Figure 3b). We hypothesize that the presence of T=T in the
double-chain reversal loop caused the equilibrium between the hybrids
to change in favor of hybrid 2, in which the damage was placed in
the edgewise loop. This hypothesis was further explored by examining
the basket fold that does not have a double-chain reversal, and the
propeller fold that has only double-chain reversal loops.

hybrid 1 and hybrid 2 folds for G-quadruplexes containing
the damaged base in different positions along the human telomere sequence

entry 2JSK)12 and type 2 (PDB entry 2JSQ)12 with their representative current–time
(i–t) trace signatures. (b) Current histograms
representing % IM/I0 of the events characteristic of the hybrid folds.

The remainder of the event types observed in the
T=T-containing
quadruplexes were characteristic of the loop entry and the triplexlike
folding intermediate. The frequency of loop entry in all damaged quadruplexes
was similar to that observed in the native sequence [∼20% (Figure
S3 of the Supporting Information)]. Finally,
the observed percentage of triplexlike events was slightly higher
than that of the natural sequence [∼5% (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information)]. This observation was
expected on the basis of the lower Tm values
for the damage-containing strands. Another possible structure for
the human telomere sequence in KCl solution was characterized as a
basket fold with two tetrads that results when the 5′ TA tail
is removed and the 3′ tail is truncated to a single T.51 In the study presented here, the natural form
of the human telomere sequence was studied with 5′ TA and 3′
TT tails that was shown by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to adopt
the hybrid folds;12,13 therefore, a two-tetrad basket
fold was not expected in these studies.
In summary, the α-HL experiment allowed us to determine that
T=Ts in the loops of G-quadruplexes show a favorability for edgewise
loops over double-chain reversal loops that could not have been determined
by CD, EMSA, or Tm experiments.

Basket
Fold
In NaCl solutions, the human telomere sequence
assumes a basket fold that consists of two edgewise loops and one
diagonal loop (Figure 4a). The basket fold
can interact with the α-HL in two different manners. (1) It
enters the vestibule, unravels, threads into the narrow constriction
zone of the β-barrel with either of the two-nucleotide overhang
tails, and translocates across the pore, or (2) it enters the vestibule
from the loop side with both overhangs distant from the constriction;
thus, it is unable to thread and translocate until the molecule escapes
back to the cis side of the protein channel in a
diffusion-controlled process.44,52 Similar to the case
for the native sequence, the damage-containing ODNs folded in a basket
fashion featured the same event distributions: one that translocated
across the α-HL channel presenting a deep current blockage (pattern
1, Figure 4b) and one that did not translocate
through the channel presenting a shallower current blockage (pattern
2, Figure 4b). Moreover, the deep current blockage
event type was modestly sensitive to increased voltage, giving an
inverse correlation, indicating that it unravels and translocates
to the trans side of the pore (Figure 4c). The shallow current blockage gave a time distribution
with change in the voltage that was shallow and was interpreted to
indicate a diffusion-controlled process back out the cis opening of the pore. These results are interpreted to mean that
the T=T in a basket fold does not affect the structure of the G-quadruplex
significantly. Further, this single-molecule experiment supports the
conclusions drawn from the Tm and CD experiments
in which incorporation of a T=T in an edgewise or diagonal loop is
not very destabilizing to the secondary structure.

dependence studies in which the translocation times (tD) of ∼500 events were fit to an exponential decay

Propeller Fold
Under dehydrating conditions (5 M LiCl),
the human telomere sequence can assume the propeller fold (all double-chain
reversal loops) in the presence of K+.17,18,53 The intact propeller fold was too large
[∼4 nm (Figure 1)] to enter the vestibule
of the α-HL nanopore [∼3.0 nm (Figure 1)]; therefore, the only events detected during the nanopore
study were very short spikes caused by random interactions of the
G-quadruplex with the mouth of the vestibule (Figure 5a). This observation was previously reported by our laboratory.44 When a T=T was introduced into the sequence,
deep current blockage events were recorded as shown in the bottom i–t trace in Figure 5a. Two
distinct current versus time populations were observed in heat plots
of the data (Figure 5b and Figure S6 of the Supporting
Information). We interpret these two populations to represent
different entry orientations of the ODN. On the basis of our previous
knowledge from the hybrid studies, T=T is not preferred in a double-chain
reversal loop. Therefore, the T=T can unwind the propeller fold to
a triplexlike structure that has a head with a loop and a tail comprised
of eight nucleotides (Figure 5c). Correlating
with the Tm data, the shortest translocation
time was observed for the ODN that contained the T=T in the middle
of the structure (Table 2 and Figure S5 of
the Supporting Information). The T=T in
the middle loop would have the largest effect on the ability of the
ODN to fold, explaining its lower Tm value
and the shorter translocation time (Figure S5 of the Supporting Information).

human telomere sequence in 5 M LiCl. (a) Undamaged propeller fold
(PDB entry 1KF1)16 structure and typical nanopore experiment i–t traces. The intact propeller fold oligomer is
too large to enter the vestibule of the α-HL; therefore, there
are no translocation events. Once the damage is introduced, long,
deep blockage events that might correspond to a triplexlike structure
caused by the partial unfolding of the propeller due to the damage
are observed. (b) Representative heat plot of the T=T-containing
telomere sequence and a triplex-forming sequence where Gs have been
substituted with Ts at either the 5′ or 3′ ends. (c)
Proposed structure based on ref (49).

Two lines of evidence support the hypothesis that incorporation
of T=T into a propeller G-quadruplex yields a triplexlike structure.
First, the CD spectra for the T=T-containing quadruplexes in 5 M LiCl
give similar spectra (λmax = 264 nm, and λmin = 240 nm) as reported by Sugiyama and co-workers for the
triplex-forming sequence.49 Second,
a series of control strands was designed to model the triplex species
induced by the T=T, in which the terminal 5′ or 3′ GGG
was converted to a 5′ or 3′ TTT, respectively. These
control sequences had an eight-nucleotide tail on the 5′ or
3′ end. Nanopore analysis of these control strands also gave
two current–time populations in the heat plots shown in Figure 5b. These control studies yielded data that were
similar to the data collected for T=T-containing quadruplexes, which
are interpreted to mean that T=T causes the double-chain reversal
loop to unwind giving a structure that behaves like the nanopore as
a control strand that can adopt a triplexlike structure. Recent molecular
dynamic simulations identified that the parallel triplex is not stable
compared to the antiparallel triplex;54 because CD data dos not exist for the parallel triplex, we cannot
determine the exact strand orientation for these strands in our studies.
Additionally, the current data point toward the triplex fold as the
structure formed when T=T is present in the propeller fold; however,
until the triplex is adequately characterized by NMR or X-ray methods,
it will remain elusive, but this structure provides the best explanation
for a number of previous experimental observations and the results
presented here.18,43,49,50 This observation further supports our hypothesis
that T=Ts inhibit double-chain reversal loop formation.

Discussion
In this work, established methods were used to study how UV-induced
damage affects the structure of the human telomere G-quadruplex folds.
Utilizing CD and EMSA techniques, it was found that the hybrid and
basket folds are formed regardless of the loop in which the T=T was
placed (Figure 2 and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). The Tm results suggest
that T=Ts cause a moderate decrease (∼5 °C) in the thermal
stability of hybrid and basket folds (Table 2). Similar to the current results, the introduction
of thymine glycol36 or 8-oxo-A38 into a loop was not detrimental to the hybrid
or basket structure based on CD and EMSA experiments. Furthermore,
introduction of T=T or thymine glycol into a loop of a G-quadruplex
induced only a moderate decrease in the thermal stability. Contrary
to these results, the introduction of 8-oxo-A into the loops caused
a significant increase in the Tm.38 These data are interpreted to mean that the
cyclobutane ring of the T=T restricts the conformational flexibility
of the loops that leads to a subtle decrease in stability without
altering the overall fold for hybrid and basket G-quadruplexes. In
contrast to these observations, T=T in the human telomere sequence
under propeller folding conditions demonstrated the largest effect
on the thermal stabilities (Table 2). In addition,
the CD spectrum showed that the fold resembles a triplexlike structure
and not a propeller fold.48,49 The conventional studies
performed yielded interesting results. However, they were inadequate
to predict the changes that introduction of the T=T causes to the
G-quadruplex fold. Therefore, we utilized a single-molecule method
that was recently shown to be an excellent tool for observing the
different folds of the G-quadruplex.43 The
nanopore measurements gave us a unique opportunity to further explore
how UV-induced DNA damage affects folding of the human telomeric G-quadruplexes
under different physical conditions.

The α-HL nanopore
has been extensively used to study nucleic
acids.55−57 A simple G-quadruplex containing
only two tetrads [thrombin binding aptamer (TBA)] was first studied
using α-HL regarding its cation affinities, followed by the
studies of thrombin–TBA interactions.58−62 Later, the human telomere sequence and the different
folds that
G-quadruplex can assume were studied by our laboratory.43,44 The ability of α-HL to distinguish between different G-quadruplex
folds is attributed, among others, to the recently discovered sensing
zone that is located in the vestibule rather than in the β-barrel
of the protein ion channel.44,63 The vestibule of the
α-HL (∼3.0 nm) was shown to exclude the propeller fold
(1.8 nm × 4.0 nm), because its dimensions are too large for it
to enter (Figure 1).44 The hybrid folds were barely able to enter (2.7 nm × 3.0 nm),
and therefore, even the slight difference in shape between hybrid
1 and hybrid 2 gave different signals.43 Finally, the basket fold (2.4 nm × 2.8 nm) was small enough
to easily enter and translocate across the pore.44 In this study, we have shown using the nanopore method
that when the T=T was introduced into a double-chain reversal loop
of the hybrid fold the equilibrium between the hybrids changed to
favor the conformation with T=T positioned in an edgewise loop (Figure 6). This hypothesis was further supported by examining
the other folds of the human telomere sequence: propeller (all double-chain
reversal loops) and basket (no double-chain reversal loops). The T=T-containing
basket fold showed the same type of events as the natural sequence,
whereas propeller folding conditions showed events that were similar
to those of a triplexlike fold, thus supporting our hypothesis that
T=Ts are not well accommodated in the double-chain reversal loop (Figure 6). These results are interpreted to mean that locking
the loop Ts by cyclobutane dimerization causes the loop topology to
be hindered in a way that does not favor double-chain reversal loop
formation.

Figure 6 Summary of the structural interpretation of the nanopore data and
observational changes in the Tm and CD
measurements.

The hybrid fold is the
proposed topology of the G-quadruplex that
the telomere region assumes in vivo.(13,21,23) Hybrids can adopt two different
folds positioning the double-chain reversal loop at the 3′
or 5′ terminus of the G-quadruplex (Figure 6). The ability of the hybrid to change from hybrid 1 to hybrid
2 allows the fold to accommodate the T=T damage without significant
structural perturbations. This quality of the telomere is crucial
for its function because the region is hypersensitive to UV-induced
damage.27 Telomere damage that causes a
change in the folding pattern (e.g., G oxidation products)35 is proposed to induce telomere shortening that
ultimately leads to cell death.30 The single-stranded
portion of the telomere is protected from degradation and RPA recognition
by the overhang binding protein POT1 and TTP1.25,64 It was recently shown by Ray et al.24 that the hybrid fold is crucial for POT1 binding. Therefore, DNA
damage that significantly affects the G-quadruplex structure will
decrease the extent of binding of the POT1–TTP1 complex in vivo, in a fashion analogous to that of G oxidation products
that significantly impact the structural fold.29 However, on the basis of the results presented here, T=T
does not greatly affect the overall topology of the G-quadruplex hybrid
fold; therefore, photodamaged telomeric sequences do not lose protection
by POT1–TTP1 complex
binding and, ultimately, do not cause telomere shortening in contrast
to damage from G oxidation. These data demonstrate that T=Ts are accommodated
in the G-quadruplex folds of the human telomere sequence, and therefore,
damage can accumulate without causing significant structural perturbations
leading to telomere truncation. On the other hand, G-quadruplex-forming
sequences that favor an all-parallel propeller fold are now predicted
to be markedly destabilized if thymine photodimers are formed in their
loop regions (Figure 6).

Conclusions
Following
the traditional procedures for analyzing G-quadruplexes
(CD, Tm, and EMSA), we demonstrated that
the presence of T=T damage does not significantly distort the overall
secondary structure and only slightly decreases the stabilities of
hybrid and basket folds (Figure 2, Figure S2
of the Supporting Information, and Table 2). To gain more insight into the structural changes
that can arise from T=T formation in telomeres, we used the α-HL
nanopore to capture and analyze the damaged folds at a single-molecule
level. From these experiments, we established that the presence of
a T=T in the hybrid folds changed the ratio of the hybrid types to
favor the conformation that positions the damaged site at an edgewise
loop instead of a double-chain reversal loop. This observation was
further verified by examining the basket fold (edgewise and diagonal
loops) and the propeller fold (all double-chain reversal loops), in
which the basket fold was not altered by T=Ts and the structure for
the propeller topology was significantly impacted.

In cells,
the predominant G-quadruplex structure for the natural
human telomere sequence is proposed to be the hybrid fold, based on
the K+ concentration inside the cell and its binding affinity
for the G-quadruplex.13,21,23 Once the T=T is present, the shape of the structure remains predominantly
the same, aside from the hybrid 1 to hybrid 2 ratio when the damage
is located in the double-chain reversal loop. This observation explains
why the telomere can still maintain its functions and does not undergo
shortening even after extensive UV irradiation.27 Even if the T=T is present in the hybrid fold, the damage
does not affect the overall shape of the fold, making it possible
for the POT1 and TPP1 proteins to bind and maintain proper function.
Therefore, hybrid G-quadruplexes can mask any detrimental structural
consequences of T=Ts in the cell.
