High-density lipoprotein (HDL) retards
atherosclerosis by accepting
cholesterol from the artery wall. However, the structure of the proposed
acceptor, monomeric apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein
of HDL, is poorly understood. Two published models for monomeric apoA-I
used cross-linking distance constraints to derive best fit conformations.
This approach has limitations. (i) Cross-linked peptides provide no
information about secondary structure. (ii) A protein chain can be
folded in multiple ways to create a best fit. (iii) Ad hoc folding of a secondary structure is unlikely to produce a stable
orientation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. To address these
limitations, we used a different approach. We first noted that the
dimeric apoA-I crystal structure, (Δ185–243)apoA-I, is
topologically identical to a monomer in which helix 5 forms a helical
hairpin, a monomer with a hydrophobic cleft running the length of
the molecule. We then realized that a second crystal structure, (Δ1–43)apoA-I,
contains a C-terminal structure that fits snuggly via aromatic and
hydrophobic interactions into the hydrophobic cleft. Consequently,
we combined these crystal structures into an initial model that was
subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. We tested the initial
and simulated models and the two previously published models in three
ways: against two published data sets (domains predicted to be helical
by H/D exchange and six spin-coupled residues) and against our own
experimentally determined cross-linking distance constraints. We note
that the best fit simulation model, superior by all tests to previously
published models, has dynamic features of a molten globule with interesting
implications for the functions of apoA-I.

Clinical
and epidemiological
studies show a robust, inverse association of high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the risk for coronary vascular disease
(CVD).1,2 Moreover, hypercholesterolemic mice with
genetically engineered deficiencies in proteins implicated in HDL
metabolism have strongly atherosclerotic phenotypes,3,4 providing compelling evidence that HDL is a key modulator of atherosclerosis
in animal models. These observations have triggered intense interest
in targeting HDL for therapeutic intervention.

The relationship
of HDL-C to CVD is complex, however, because lower
HDL-C levels are not uniformly associated with an increased cardiovascular
risk.5−7 Moreover, several recent clinical studies have failed
to show any benefit from the pharmacological elevation of HDL-C levels
in statin-treated humans with established CVD.8,9 These
observations suggest that HDL-C levels provide limited information
about HDL’s proposed cardioprotective effects. Therefore, the
rational design of therapies and assessments of their benefits demand
detailed knowledge of the assembly and molecular structure of the
cardioprotective form of HDL.

The anti-atherogenic nature of
HDL has been most firmly related
to reverse cholesterol transport, in which apoA-I, HDL’s major
protein, accepts cholesterol from artery wall cells, counteracting
lipid loading.8 Thus, the level of atherosclerosis
is markedly increased in hypercholesterolemic mice that lack apoA-I,11,12 while transgenic expression of apoA-I inhibits atherosclerosis in
a wide variety of hypercholesterolemic animal models.13−16 ApoA-I is secreted into the bloodstream as a lipid-free or lipid-poor
monomer (preβ HDL), which is widely believed to be the most
common acceptor of sterol transported out of cells.17 The circulating form of mature human apoA-I contains 243
amino acids encoded by exon 3 (residues 1–43) and exon 4 (residues
44–243). The region encoded by exon 4 contains 10 tandem 11/22
residue repeats, termed helical repeats 1–10 (H1–H10,
respectively), which form a series of lipid-binding class A amphipathic
helices.

ApoA-I accepts sterol from ABCA1, a transmembrane ATPase,
to become
discoidal HDL. In this configuration, two antiparallel molecules of
apoA-I form a belt around the edge of a disk of phospholipid and cholesterol.18−23 This dimerization of apoA-I is driven in part by the formation of
salt bridges among the 10 helical repeats.20 The flexible nature of apoA-I plays a key role in the lipidation
and assembly of HDL by ABCA1,24 but this
property hampers high-resolution structural studies of the full-length
protein under physiologically relevant conditions. Fortunately, molecular
modeling provides an alternative approach to understanding HDL’s
structure.

Two all-atom models for lipid-free full-length human
apoA-I have
been proposed by Silva et al.25 and Pollard
et al.26 Both models are helix bundle structures
constructed as best fit explanations of the cross-linked peptides
that are identified when apoA-I is exposed to chemical cross-linkers
and then analyzed by high-precision mass spectrometry. In both models,
H5, the central helical repeat of apoA-I, forms a helical hairpin.
The Silva model is essentially an antiparallel six-helix bundle structure,
while the Pollard model is a more loosely packed helix bundle structure
containing multiple short helical segments.

Two crystal structures
have also been determined for lipid-free
human apoA-I: the N-terminally truncated structure (Δ1–43)
of Borhani et al.18 and the high-resolution
C-terminally truncated (Δ185–243) crystal structure of
Mei and Atkinson.27 The Borhani structure
is 93% helical and contains an antiparallel four-helix bundle with
an elliptical ring shape, a model more consistent with the structure
of apoA-I bound to discoidal HDL particles.18 The structure of Mei and Atkinson is less helical and forms a more
compact helix bundle, which is more consistent with the biophysical
and biochemical properties of lipid-free apoA-I.27 There are, however, substantial similarities between the
two structures, e.g., the pattern of salt bridges between helical
repeats 4 and 6 and pairwise helical repeats 5.28

In their two models for monomeric apoA-I, Silva et
al.25 and Pollard et al.26 determined distance constraints by measuring maximal potential
distances
between the α-carbons of cross-linked amino acids in two different
peptides. While driven by data, this approach has several limitations.
(i) Cross-linked peptides provide no information about secondary structure.
(ii) A secondary structure can be folded in many ways to create a
best fit. (iii) Ad hoc folding of a secondary structure
may not produce a stable conformation in which the hydrophobic and
hydrophilic residues are oriented correctly. In the studies presented
here, we used a different approach. Starting from first principles
based on known protein structures, we generated an initial model,
which we then subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We
ranked the resulting models by how well they conformed to two published
data sets: domains predicted to be helical by H/D exchange and six
spin-coupled residues. We tested the best fit model by chemically
cross-linking peptides. The proposed structure, a molten globule,
has interesting implications for the function of apoA-I.

Materials and
Methods
Initial Models
We created an initial crystal model
by taking parts of the recent crystal structure for dimeric C-terminally
truncated apoA-I by Mei and Atkinson27 [Protein
Data Bank (PDB) entry 3R2P] and parts of the crystal structure for the tetrameric
N-terminally truncated apoA-I of Borhani et al.18 (PDB entry 1AV1). We began by building a monomer that was as complete
as possible from each crystal structure by selecting residues from
different chains so that there would be a continuous backbone connection
and the monomer was as compact as possible. The parts from dimeric
C-terminally truncated apoA-I were residues 3–130 of chain
A and residues 131–182 of chain B. This formed a C-terminally
truncated monomer of residues 3–182. The parts from tetrameric
N-terminally truncated apoA-I were residues 43–67 of chain
A, residues 68–130 of chain D, residues 131–192 of chain
C, and residues 193–243 of chain B. This formed an N-terminally
truncated monomer of residues 43–243. The two terminally truncated
monomers are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting
Information. An immediate observation is that the structures
are quite similar, especially with respect to the main double helix
consisting of residues 68–182.

To build the initial crystal
model, we formed a complete monomer by joining residues 3–182
of our C-terminally truncated monomer to residues 183–243 from
our N-terminally truncated monomer. To insert residues 193–243
into the hydrophobic cleft seen in residues 3–182 (Figure 1d), we repositioned residues 193–243 by bending
them slightly and stretching them at several points along the backbone.
This aligned them with the aromatic residues of the cleft, as explained
in more detail in Results. The hairpin between
residues 192 and 193 in the N-terminally truncated monomer was instrumental
in joining the long helix of residues 131–182 of the C-terminally
truncated monomer around the bottom of the hybrid crystal model to
residues 193–243 of the N-terminally truncated monomer via
the short helix of residues 183–192. Additionally, residues
1 and 2 were taken from a previous simulation of ours of monomeric
apoA-I at 500 K. The two residues were in a random coil structure
and were joined to residue 3.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All-atom MD was performed
using NAMD29 after solvating and ionizing
the initial structure as described previously.30,31 After minimization and heating to 500 K for 50 ps, the MD simulation
consisted of a 30 ns equilibration at 500 K. Postprocessing of trajectories
was analyzed by writing VMD-Tcl scripts.

ApoA-I Model Figures
All molecular model figures were
created with the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System (version 1.3, Schrödinger).

Root-Mean-Square Deviation and Root-Mean-Square Fluctuation
The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of protein α-carbon
atoms was calculated for the apoA-I monomer over the entire 30 ns
duration of the simulation by using the RMSD Trajectory Tool extension
in VMD. The root-mean-square fluctuation (rmsf) of protein α-carbon
atoms was calculated for the apoA-I monomer over the entire 30 ns
duration of the simulation by using the “measure rmsf”
command in VMD.

Measurement of α Helicity
The fraction of all
protein residues that were α-helical was measured every time
increment over the course of the 30 ns trajectory, using VMD’s
implementation of the protein secondary structure determination program,
STRIDE.32

Average 10–20 and
15 ns Models
This average
structure was created by averaging the protein atom coordinates over
all frames of the simulation from 10 to 20 ns by using the “measure
avpos” command in VMD after aligning over all atoms with respect
to the 10 ns frame. Because averaging creates possible close contacts
between atoms and deforms bond lengths, torsions, and dihedrals, the
structure was then subjected to 10000 steps of steepest-descent energy
minimization. The result is called the 10–20 ns model.

Because the protein structure at 15 ns is kinetically expanded by
the 500 K temperature of the simulation, we performed a 0.1 ns linear
MD simulation cooling of the 15 ns structure to 310 K. The result
is called the 15 ns model.

Sum of Spin-Coupled Residue Distances of
&gt;20 Å and Number
of Spin-Coupled Distances of &gt;20 Å
To determine the
sum of the spin-coupled residue distances of &gt;20 Å and the
number
of spin-coupled distances of &gt;20 Å, we measured distances
between
the protein α-carbons for the spin-coupled residues by writing
VMD-Tcl scripts for the individual models as well as over the 30 ns
trajectory. See Results for more details.

Relative Residue to Residue Proximities Shown as Protein Contact
Maps
To obtain protein contact maps for the 15 ns model and
over the 30 ns trajectory, we counted the number of times that α-carbon
atoms were within 23 Å of each other for every time increment
of that simulation. The results were then combined and are shown as
a contour plot of one color (for the one frame) or four colors (for
the trajectory) indicating the quartile of counts (except for a count
of 0, which is white) relative to the maximal number over all pairs
of residues, respectively, using the graphics software GNUPLOT (www.gnuplot.info).

Sum of the Violation Distance Algorithm
The violation
distance algorithm attempts to measure, given a set of distance constraints
such as experimental cross-links, the amount that a given structure
violates those constraints. For each experimentally determined cross-link, xi,yi, where xi and yi are the
residue numbers of the lysine pairs (and the N-terminus) of the ith cross-link, a violation will occur if the minimal distance
between the Cα atoms of xi and yi, di(xi,yi),
is greater than the 23 Å length of the cross-linking reagent
MDA33 (a distance of &lt;28 Å for
the reagent used by Silva et al.25 and
Pollard et al.26). The sum of violations,
∑[di(xi,yi) – r], where r is
the length of the cross-linker, plotted against the number of individual
violations, is the extent to which any given model is consistent with
the cross-linking data. The best model will be closest to the x,y origin. Because we can also examine
MD trajectories instead of given structures, any single Cα–Cα
distance ≤ r for a given xi,yi in any MD trajectory frame indicates no violation distance.
Finally, for each cross-link xi,yi pair, we count
only the minimal violation distance to calculate the sum of violation
distances.

Isolating HDL and ApoA-I
Plasma
was prepared from EDTA-anticoagulated
blood collected from healthy adult subjects who had fasted overnight.
HDL (density of 1.125–1.210 g/mL) was isolated from plasma
by sequential ultracentrifugation and depleted of apolipoproteins
E and B100 by heparin-agarose chromatography.34 ApoA-I was purified from HDL by ion exchange chromatography.34 The protein concentration was determined with
the Lowry assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), with albumin as the standard.
The Human Studies Committees at the University of Washington School
of Medicine approved all protocols involving human material.

Cross-Linking
Reactions and Liquid Chromatography–Electrospray
Ionization Mass Spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS)
Previous
studies demonstrate that malondialdehyde (MDA), a major product of
lipid peroxidation that is also a reactive carbonyl peptide cross-linker,
markedly impairs the ability of lipid-free apoA-I to promote the efflux
of cholesterol from cells by the ABCA1 pathway.35 To further test the fit of the models to experimental data,
we used MS to detect apoA-I peptides that had been cross-linked with
MDA, a major product of lipid peroxidation.35,2 Reactions
of freshly prepared MDA with lipid-free apoA-I (5 μM, 0.14 mg/mL)
were conducted at 37 °C for 24 h in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) containing 100 μM diethyleneaminepentaacetic acid to
chelate redox-active metal ions.36 Reactions
were initiated by adding MDA and terminated by adding a 20-fold molar
excess (relative to MDA) of aminoguanidine.35,37 The apoA-I monomer, dimer, and multimer were separated by high-resolution
size exclusion chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography
(two Superdex 200 10/300 GL columns, GE Healthcare). The monomer fractions
were collected, combined, and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 filters
(Millipore) before being digested.

Concentrated fractions were
digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) or endoproteinase
Glu-C (from Staphylococcus aureus V8, Roche Applied
Science) in 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8).35,38 Proteolytic digests were desalted by solid phase extraction (OASIS
HLB cartridge, Waters Corp., Milford, MA) and then analyzed by LC–ESI-MS/MS
in positive ion mode on a hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap instrument
(Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanoflow UPLC system
(NanoAcquity, Waters Corp.). MS survey scans were performed from m/z 200 to 2000 at a resolution of 60000
and ion populations of 5 × 105. Data-dependent analyses
were performed using MS survey scans followed by data-dependent selection
of the five most abundant precursor ions for MS/MS. Every sample was
analyzed twice. Singly charged precursors were rejected from the data-dependent
scan in the first run, and singly, doubly, and triply charged precursors
were rejected from data-dependent selection in the second run to obtain
optimal MS/MS scans for cross-linked peptides that usually present
as ≥4+ ions.

Potentially cross-linked peptides were identified
using a spreadsheet
containing the masses of each possible peptide pair (or a single peptide
for intrapeptide cross-links) plus the mass of the MDA cross-linker
(K+36+K).35,2 All peptide identifications were confirmed
by inspection of the MS/MS spectra, using the following criteria:
(i) mass being within 10 ppm of the calculated mass, (ii) corresponding
MS/MS spectrum exhibiting at least 50% of the b and y series of theoretical
fragment ions expected, and (iii) all major fragmentation ions being
consistent with the peptide identification.

Results
The Crystal
Structures of C-Terminally Truncated ApoA-I and
N-Terminally Truncated ApoA-I Potentially Interact via a Hydrophobic
Cleft
The similarity of the two models created by the selection
of individual fragments of different chains from the structures of
Borhani et al.18 and Mei and Atkinson27 shown in Figure S1a,b of the Supporting Information led us to consider the possibility
that a combination of these two general conformations might provide
a model for the structure of lipid-free apoA-I in solution. Figure 1a shows a ribbon model
of the (Δ185–243)apoA-I crystal structure determined
by Mei and Atkinson.27 The H5 region of
the structure has been proposed to function as a hinge that allows
the extended form of apoA-I to fold back on itself to interconvert
the protein between a monomer and dimer in solution.27 This structure is topologically identical to a monomer
in which helix 5 forms a helical hairpin, converting the intermolecular
H4/H6 pairings of the dimer into monomeric intramolecular H4/H6 pairings
(Figure 1b). We observed that the space-filling
model of the monomer created this way has a remarkable hydrophobic
cleft running the length of the molecule. The cleft contains only
aliphatic (gold) and aromatic (magenta) residues (Figure 1c,d).

Inspection of the C-terminal portion
of the (Δ1–43)apoA-I crystal structure determined by
Borhani et al.18 suggested that residues
183–243 of the C-terminus (Figure 1e,f)
[residues 183 and 184 are not resolved in the (Δ185–243)apoA-I
crystal structure] would fit snuggly into the hydrophobic cleft (Figure 1d). Only small bending and stretching of residues
183–243 aligned four of the cleft’s five aromatic residues
(Figure 1d) with the four aromatic residues
in the fragment of Borhani et al. (Figure 1g). We therefore docked this peptide (Figure 1e,f) with the monomeric (Δ185–243)apoA-I structure in
Figure 1b to create an all-atom model for full-length
monomeric lipid-free apoA-I (Figure 1h,i) that
we term the initial crystal model. Importantly, we generated this
model of full-length apoA-I by combining the two crystal structures
of opposite ends of the protein into a hybrid structure.

MD Simulations
with a Temperature Jump Decrease the Helicity
of the Initial Crystal Model to Physiologically Plausible Levels
The experimentally determined helicity for monomeric lipid-free
human apoA-I is 55 ± 5%.25,39,40 Our hybrid structure had significantly more helicity (74%). We therefore
used MD simulations of the initial crystal model to explore additional
conformational space. As MD simulations at 310 K produced only minor
structural changes, we subjected the initial crystal model to MD simulations
at 500 K for 30 ns. The rmsd of this simulation is shown in Figure
S2 of the Supporting Information; the rmsd
of the full model flattens out between 15 and 28 ns but increases
between 28 and 30 ns (Figure S2a of the Supporting
Information), suggesting at least a portion of the model is
not equilibrating. Restriction of the rmsd to the model’s core
helical domains 1, 4 and 5 (see Figure 6a for
the definition) shows that the core is equilibrated from 15 ns to
the 30 ns end (Figure S2b of the Supporting Information). The rmsd of the noncore domains, however, increased between 28
and 30 ns (Figure S2c of the Supporting Information), and thus, these domains account for the corresponding increase
in the rmsd of the full model.

Changes in the helicity of the
initial crystal model with simulation time decreased for the first
10 ns and then reached a relatively steady state between 10 and 20
ns (white dotted line in Figure 2a), indicating
that the ensemble of structures reached some sort of conformational
stability. The simulation between 10 and 20 ns exhibited ∼58%
helicity, in excellent agreement with the value of 55 ± 5% reported
in the literature for lipid-free monomeric apoA-I.25,39,40

crystal model.

Testing Candidate MD Simulation
Models against Published Experimental
Data
Using site-directed spin-label electron paramagnetic
resonance spectroscopy (EPR), Lagerstedt et al.41 identified six spin-coupled residues (G26, L44, L64, S167,
G217, and K226) in lipid-free human apoA-I. In the initial crystal
model, all but G26 are exposed to solvent and four (L44, L64, G217,
and K226) are in loops on the surface of our 15 ns model (Figure 3c); the two that are not, G26 and S167, are small
and in physical contact with each other.

et al.40 and the spin-coupled residues

to define a central plane. (a) Bar graph showing the goodness of fit
of helicity of five models (initial crystal, 10–20 ns, 15 ns,
Silva, and Pollard) to the position of the five helical regions (designated
1–5) predicted by Chetty et al.40 using H/D exchange. (b and c) Relaxed-eyed stereo ribbon images

model and (c) 15 ns model. Distances between residues are denoted
by dotted lines. Color code: H5 (residues 121–143), green;
prolines, yellow spheres; H10 (residues 221–243), red; remainder

orange.

To be spin-coupled, residue pairs
must be within ∼20 Å
of each other. The fact that six residues distributed along the full
length of the apoA-I sequence, mostly on the surface, are spin-coupled
suggests that the six form a spatially compact cluster in the solution
structure of monomeric apoA-I.41 We therefore
analyzed distances between the six spin-coupled residues over the
30 ns of MD simulation. As seen in Figure 2b, the sum of distances for the 15 combinations among the six residues
(a measure of their spatial compactness) reaches its lowest value
in the region of seeming helical equilibration (10–20 ns, double-headed
arrow). In Figure 2c, the number of distances
of ≥20 Å reaches a minimum of 2–3 near the 15 ns
structure in the middle of the region of helical equilibration defined
in Figure 2a.

On the basis of the best
fit of our MD simulation of the initial
crystal model with the spin-labeled data, we selected three models
for additional analysis: (i) the initial crystal model, (ii) the average
atom coordinates of the MD structural ensemble between 10 and 20 ns,
termed the 10–20 ns model, and (iii) the 15 ns structure in
the middle of the 10–20 ns region, termed the 15 ns model,
based on the 15 ns frame of the full 30 ns ensemble. We selected the
latter model because it was in the middle of both the zone of helix
stability and the zone of spin-coupled spatial compactness. The rmsd
between the 15 ns and 10–20 ns models is 5.4 Å, suggesting
that the structures in the 10–20 ns range are not greatly different.

In the 15 ns model, cooled from 500 to 310 K, the radius of gyration
of the apoA-I monomer was smaller than in the original structure,
decreasing from 20.7 to 20.2 Å. This change reduced the monomer’s
diameter of gyration by 1.08 Å. We term the 310 K cooled-down
structure the 15 ns model. The average 10–20 ns structure,
because there is no solvent present, could not be subjected to a similar
cool-down procedure.

Chetty et al.40 used hydrogen/deuterium
(H/D) exchange coupled with proteolysis and mass spectrometry to define
the positions of helical domains in human full-length monomeric lipid-free
apoA-I. The method quantifies the H/D exchange rate of measurable
amide hydrogens at known positions throughout the native structure
with the exchange rate expected for an unstructured chain. The authors
reported three extended and two short α-helices (residues 7–44,
54–65, 70–78, 81–115, and 147–178, designated
1–5, respectively, in Figure 3a). The
overall helical content of 52% predicted by the H/D exchange study
agrees well with the values reported in the literature.25,39,40

We graphically compared
the helical regions from the H/D exchange
results of Chetty et al.40 with those predicted
by our models (the initial crystal model, the 10–20 ns model,
and the 15 ns model). We also compared the two all-atom models for
human monomeric apoA-I reported by Silva et al.25 and Pollard et al.26 Inspection
of Figure 3a suggests that our three models
fit the five domains predicted to be helical by H/D exchange significantly
better than the Silva or Pollard model. Of our models, the 15 ns model
appeared to provide the best overall fit.

We used the secondary
structure determination program STRIDE to
quantify the goodness of fit between the experimental H/D exchange
data40 and the different models. We determined
the secondary structure “match” for each residue: only
residues in the model that match residues in the H/D data (i.e., helix
to helix or nonhelix to nonhelix) are counted. The results are reported
as (i) the total number of matching residues and (ii) the fraction
of matched residues. The 15 ns model matched the H/D data better than
the initial crystal model or the 10–20 ns model (Table 1). Further, each of our models matched the H/D exchange
data significantly better than either the Silva model or the Pollard
model (Table 1). The total helicities of the
10–20 ns model and the 15 ns model were 56 and 59%, respectively,
in good agreement with the value of 55 ± 5% reported in the literature.25,39,40

We next compared
the fit of our models and the Silva25 and
Pollard26 models
with the EPR spin-coupled data,41 using
the following metrics: (i) the sum of distances (the total pairwise
distances among Cα atoms of all six residues) and (ii) the number
of distances between residues of &gt;20 Å (the distance monitored
by spin coupling). Each of our models fits the spin-coupled data better
than either the Silva model or the Pollard model (Table 2); again, the 15 ns model provides the best fit. Panels b
and c of Figure 3 compare the locations of
the six spin-coupled residues in stereo images of two of our models,
the initial crystal model and the 15 ns model. Each pair distance
is denoted by a dotted line and distance in angstroms. In the initial
crystal model, the six residues are scattered over the length of the
monomer (Figure 3b). In the 15 ns model, the
six residues form a spatially compact cluster. It is noteworthy that
five of the six residues form a plane that is approximately equidistant
from the long ends of the model (Figure 3c).41

To further test the fit of the models
to experimental data, we
used mass spectrometry to detect apoA-I peptides that we had cross-linked
with MDA. We exposed full-length lipid-free human apoA-I (0.14 mg/mL,
predominantly monomeric) to MDA (100 μM) in 50 mM sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 μM DTPA. Reactions were initiated
by adding MDA and terminated by adding a 20-fold molar excess (relative
to MDA) of aminoguanidine. Following high-resolution size exclusion
chromatography, monomeric apoA-I was digested with trypsin. Then the
peptide digest was analyzed by MS/MS on a high-mass resolution Orbitrap
instrument. This approach identified 41 cross-linked pairs of peptides
with a high degree of confidence (based on the mass accuracy of the
peptide–peptide adduct and the tandem mass spectrum of the
peptide). The cross-linked peptides we detected and their tandem mass
spectra are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 and Figure S3 of the Supporting
Information.

We applied two
methods to establish the goodness of fit of the
models with the cross-linking data. First, we used the sum of violation
distances algorithm recently described by Kalisman et al.42 to analyze the goodness of fit of different
models to cross-link violation distances. We assumed a maximal Cα
distance of linkable lysine residues of 23 Å, defined as 20 Å
+ 3.0 Å, the estimated coordinate error for two mobile surface
residues.33 For each of the six models,
the number of violations and the sum of minimal violations were plotted
on the x- and y-axes, respectively
(Figure 4a). In this plot, the initial crystal
model is farthest from the origin, while the Pollard, Silva, and 10–20
ns models, in rank order, fall progressively closer to the origin.
The best fit for any model (i.e., the one falling closest to the origin)
was that of the 15 ns model. For comparison, a full trajectory analysis
of the 0–30 ns MD simulation at 500 K, termed the full trajectory
model, is also shown in Figure 4a. It should
be noted that, in the latter analysis, every structure in the simulation
was considered and the minimum of each individual violation distance
was found among possibly different structures.

cross-link data for different models.

Overlay of 41 chemical cross-linking data points onto a static contact
map plot of Cα distances of ≤23 Å for the 15 ns
model. Small purple circles represent the positions of all potential
cross-links, red circles the most probable one-third of cross-links,
yellow circles the median probable one-third of cross-links, and blue
circles the least probable one-third of cross-links. Red arrowheads
denote four loops and turns numbered from the N-terminus and blue
arrowheads the N- and C-termini. Two cross-links (182–195 and
195–206) at turn/loop 4 are denoted with red bull’s-eyes
and four cross-links of H5 to H10 (118–226, 118–239,
133–239, and 140–239) with magenta bull’s-eyes,
and the cross-link supporting an H5 hairpin (118–140) is denoted
with a blue bull’s-eye.

For the second method for analyzing the goodness of fit,
we plotted
each chemical cross-link as a colored dot onto the background of a
two-dimensional contact map of all 23 Å residue-to-residue contacts,
focusing on the static 15 ns model (Figure 4b). The apparent abundance of each cross-linked peptide (monitored
as ion current) is indicated by the color of the corresponding dot.
For comparison, we also plotted the cross-linking data on the contact
map calculated over the full trajectory (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information).

Overall, the abundant
peptides exhibited an excellent fit to the
15 ns model (red dots in Figure 4b). The majority
of those cross-linked peptides were in the most mobile regions of
the models: at the N- and C-termini (blue arrowheads) and near hairpins
and loops represented by the junction of contact zones with (and at
right angles to) the diagonal line of equality (red arrowheads).

Figure 5a is a stereo ribbon image of the
15 ns model. The five domains predicted to be helical by H/D exchange
and the four domains that are helical in the 15 ns model but not helical
as predicted by H/D exchange40 are colored
red and green, respectively. Figure 5b illustrates
the general conformation of the 15 ns model in the form of a stereo
cartoon in which the 10 helical segments are shown as cylinders. The
following are key features of the model. (i) The C-terminal H10 (red)
is nestled under the folded H5 helical hairpin (green) covering the
antiparallel H4–H6 array (residues 100–120 and 144–164).
(ii) The C-terminal and N-terminal domains, residues 226–239
(red) and 7–31 (yellow), respectively, are in contact, forming
an antiparallel helical array. (iii) H5 and the N- and C-terminal
segments are in the proximity of each other on the side of the model
facing the viewer, a feature also found in the Silva25 model.

are indicated as in panel a.

Discussion
By combining published crystal structures
of the C-terminal and
N-terminal portions of apoA-I, we derived an initial all-atom crystal
model for the full-length monomeric protein. Using MD simulations,
we modified that initial crystal model into a 10–20 ns model
and a 15 ns model.

Figure 6 Ribbon comparison of the four alternatively open and closed
structures:
15 ns (Closed1) → 20 ns (Open1) →
25 ns (Closed2) → 28 ns (Open2). Color
code: H10, red; H5, green; H4, cyan; H6, magenta; remainder of structure,
gray; N-termini, yellow arrowheads; C-termini, red arrowheads. In
both transitions from open to closed structures, H5 and H10 move away
from each other and from the main body of the protein exposing the
H4–H5–H6 hairpin so that a second apoA-I rotated along
its long axis by 180° can dimerize with the first through intermolecular
interactions of the H4–H5–H6 region.

The 10–20 ns region was used to construct
the 10–20
ns model because it represented a zone of helix stability and spin-coupled
spatial compactness. The 15 ns frame was used to create the 15 ns
model because it represented the middle of the zone of helix stability
and maximal spin-coupled spatial compactness. This choice is supported
by the cross-linking data (Figure 4a) and the
observation that the core helical domains of the model, CH1, -4, and
-5 [except for the spikes associated with the closed–open transitions
(Figure 6)], are
equilibrated at 15 ns (red circle in Figure S2b of the Supporting Information). The nonhelical core
of the simulated structure reaches initial equilibration at 10 ns
(cyan line in Figure S2c of the Supporting Information) but begins a steep increase in rmsd after 27 ns, in part because
of significant changes in the position of H10 in the model (see below).

Examination of the simulation frames between 27 and 30 ns shows
that (i) H/D helical domain 2 has become nonhelical (a particular
problem because this domain was shown by Chetty et al.40 to be helical); (ii) H10 is trapped between
CH1 and a portion of H6 and is beginning to separate from its previous
interaction with H4 and H5 (Figure S5a of the Supporting Information); and (iii) for the first time, a gap
has appeared between the H4 and H6 domains (Figure S5b of the Supporting Information). The gap and the loss
of H/D helical domain 2 would suggest that the simulation is becoming
unstable, although it is possible that the 30 ns structure represents
a new transitional conformation for monomeric apoA-I. We will pursue
the latter possibility at a later date.

We believe that the
15 ns model (Figure 5) represents the best
available static structure for human lipid-free
monomeric apoA-I; it fits all three experimentally determined parameters
(helical domains, spin-coupled residues, and chemical cross-linking
results) better than either of the two previously published all-atom
models.25,26 Because the helical structure of monomeric
human apoA-I is known to be very flexible and to unfold and refold
in a dynamic manner,40 the 15 ns model,
although static, illustrates in a clear fashion the most important
conformational features of the ensemble of structures in thermal equilibrium
(Figures 4a and 5).

The Chetty40 H/D exchange data suggest
that residues 121–143 (H5) and 180–243 (H8–H10)
are not helical. However, EPR studies led Oda et al.43 to conclude that H10 in monomeric apoA-I is at least partially
helical. We propose that H5 and H8–H10 (green helical domains
in Figure 5a) are in motion, forming and breaking
helices sufficiently rapidly that H/D exchange cannot detect them
reliably [perhaps similar to what is happening at 30 ns (Figure S5
of the Supporting Information)]. In support
of this proposal, a comparison of the 15 ns model with the 20 ns structure
(Figure 6) demonstrates that H5 and H10 have
moved away from each other and from the main body of the protein,
exposing tandem helical domains H4 and H6. This conformational transition
happens twice during the 30 ns MD simulation. The two open structures
can be recognized as two upward blips in the rmsd plot (empty arrowheads
in Figure S2a of the Supporting Information). The closed structures appear at 15 and 23 ns and the open structures
at 20 and 28 ns (Figure 6).

Although
we performed the simulation at 500 K, we found little
change in overall helicity between 10 and 30 ns (58 to 55%). We surmised
from the H/D data40 that the structure’s
core conformation remains relatively intact [red helical domains 1
(residues 7–31), 4 (residues 84–120), and 5 (residues
146–174) in Figure 5a]. Evidence of
core stability is provided by the rmsd data (Figure S2 of the Supporting Information) and by the more extensive
stability analyses shown in Figure 7. An rmsf
plot of the fluctuation of each residue during the full simulation
(Figure 7a) shows that core helix (CH) domains
1, 4, and 5 (along with smaller H/D helical domains 2 and 3) are more
stable than most of the remainder of the model.

Figure 7 Stability analysis of
the apoA-I monomer core CH1, CH4, and CH5
domains. (a) Root-mean-square fluctuation (rmsf) of all residues of
the initial crystal model of apoA-I over the entire course of the
30 ns MD simulation at 500 K. Red boxes show H/D helical regions 1,
4, and 5 (residues 7–44, 81–115, and 147–178,
respectively) that represent the core helical domains of the monomer
model. Colored circles (L22 and L163, yellow; G26 and S167, gray;
E92, red; K96, blue; Y100, Y104, Y108, and Y166, magenta; L159, green)
denote key residues in panel b that stabilize the crossover contacts
among the three core helical domains. (b) Relaxed-eye stereo view
of the CH1, CH4, and CH5 domains (transparent red ribbons identified
by pink numerals) of the 15 ns model. Hydrophobic residues of the
core are shown as green sticks. G26 and S167 (gray space-filling model)
form a hydrogen-bonded pair at the crossover between CH1 and CH5.
E92 (red space-filling model), K96 (blue space-filling model), and
Y166 (magenta space-filling model) form a cation−π complex
between CH4 and CH5. Y100, F104, and W108 (magenta, dotted space-filling
model–stick combination) form an aromatic cup around L159 (green
sticks) between CH4 and CH5. L22 on CH1 (yellow space-filling model)
packs tightly against the G26–S167 hydrogen bond. L163 on CH5
(yellow space-filling model) is tightly packed into the angle between
S167 and Y166. Y115 on CH4 associates with three surrounding hydrophobic
residues to help hold the upper ends of CH4 and CH5 together. Similar
hydrophobic interactions occur between CH4 and CH5 at the bottom.

We examined the molecular packing
of the three core helical domains
to identify stabilizing structural elements. The three helical domains
are in contact at crossover zones of CH1 with CH5 and CH5 with CH4;
CH1 makes no contact with CH4, leaving a cleft for interaction with
H10. Hydrophobic residue contact is pronounced in the crossover zones
of CH1 with CH5 and CH5 with CH4 (Figure 7b).
Importantly, detailed examination of these two crossover zones shows
several specific forms of molecular interactions (Figure 7b). (i) S167 in H5 forms a hydrogen bond with the
backbone carbonyl of G26 in CH1, a common motif in helix–helix
interaction in nonpolar environments.44 This hydrogen bond is not present in the initial crystal model.
(ii) The formation of a salt bridge from E92 to K96 on CH4 creates
a cation−π bond between K96 and Y166 of CH5.44 (iii) Three aromatic residues on CH4 (Y100,
F104, and W108) form what we call a π cup around L159 on CH5.
(iv) L22 on CH1 packs tightly against the G26–S167 hydrogen
bond. (v) L163 is tightly packed into the angle between S167 and Y166
on CH5. These 11 residues involved in molecular interactions at the
crossover zones of CH1 with CH5 and CH5 with CH4 when plotted onto
the rmsf plot of Figure 7a define the least
mobile regions of CH1, CH4, and CH5. Other interactions, e.g., between
Y115 and three surrounding hydrophobic residues and several just below
E92 (Figure 7b), hold the ends of CH4 and CH5
together.

Thus, in the MD simulation, the core remains relatively
stable
during three transitions involving H5 and H10: closed → open
→ closed → open (Figure 6). These
observations are consistent with a wide range of biophysical studies24 demonstrating that lipid-free apoA-I exhibits
a two-domain structure in solution: a more rigid N-terminal domain
(residues 1–189, red helical domains in Figure 5a) and a less organized flexible C-terminal domain (residues
190–243, green helical domains in Figure 5a).

The stability of the initial crystal model’s secondary
structure
to MD simulations at 500 K is unusual because our 500 K MD simulations
of the models of Silva25 and Pollard26 resulted in much greater changes in total helicity
(Figure S6 of the Supporting Information): the Silva model went from 52% helicity at 0 ns to 28% at 30 ns
(Figure S6a of the Supporting Information), while the Pollard model went from 54% helicity at 0 ns to 28%
at 10 ns (Figure S6b of the Supporting Information). Our model for monomeric apoA-I is stable even when compared with
one of the apolipophorin III proteins found in many insects.45 An MD simulation of the crystal structure of
that four-helix bundle apolipoprotein showed no plateau in helix stability,
which decreased linearly from 80% at 0 ns to 50% at 20 ns (Figure
S6c of the Supporting Information).

A protein that conserves a nativelike secondary structure but has
no tightly packed interior is defined as a molten globule, which supposedly
is an intermediate thermodynamic state that clearly differs from either
a tightly folded, highly stable structure or the denatured state.46 Our MD simulations, which suggest that lipid-free
apoA-I maintains a core complex of intact folded helices with dynamic
closing and opening of H5 and H10, are consistent with the definition
of a molten globule. We suggest that apoA-I is highly dynamic, with
a nativelike secondary structure that binds its targets tightly and
specifically in the absence of side chain close packing.46 Consistent with our findings, biophysical studies
suggest that apoA-I is a molten globule,39 a state suggested to mediate the incorporation of lipid into plasma.39

To sample the lipid affinity of our lipid-free
apoA-I monomer model
(Figure 5), we coarse grained the 15 ns model
and performed a 20 μs coarse grained MD simulation of the model
in a periodic solvent box containing 10 randomly distributed monomeric
POPC; the results are shown in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. After simulation, seven POPC bind,
forming a small monolayer in the monomeric apoA-I “lipid cup”.
This model shares similarities with a model for the preβ-apoA-I
monomer recently proposed by Jayaraman et al.47 that is based upon lipid-poor monomeric apoA-I released by heating
HDL. (i) Their particle contains 8 or 9 PCs and 1 CE. (ii) In their
model, the C-terminal H10 folds back against a H4–H5–H6
“bucket” (see the cup formed by H4–H5–H6
and H10 in Figure S7d of the Supporting Information) derived from the crystal structure of (Δ185–243)apoA-I.27

The open conformation of apoA-I at 20
and 28 ns suggests a mechanism
for dimerization and accumulation of lipid into the discoidal HDL
form. The 20 and 28 ns structures expose the H4–H6 hairpin
domains (Figure 6), so that two similarly structured
apoA-I monomers rotated relative to one another along their long axes
by 180° are able to dimerize. This association would be driven
by the formation of intermolecular salt bridges among the H4, H5,
and H6 domains of the two
monomers and result in close planar proximity of the six spin-coupled
residues in the dimer, as proposed by Lagerstedt et al.41 The addition of lipid (Figure S7 of the Supporting Information) and the unfolding of
the helical remainder of the two apoA-I would provide the correct
topology and lower the activation energy for dimerization. The dimerized
lipid-poor apoA-I would then be poised to grow into a fully lipidated
LL5/5 double-belt discoidal particle.20

As noted by Mei and Atkinson,27 the
paired antiparallel H5 repeats between opposing chains of the apoA-I
dimer form leucine zipper motifs. It seems likely that these are the
principal motifs for aligning the pairwise antiparallel H5 repeats
of the apoA-I dimer in the lipid-free state. For example, in the open
20 ns state (Figure 6), the leucine zippers
might “zip-lock” the double belt into the H4–H6
antiparallel pair and ultimately the full LL5/520 rotamer registration. As noted elsewhere,28 however, this leucine zipper motif may not be important
for maintaining the apoA-I dimer after apoA-I has acquired lipid,
reflecting the marked increase in helicity and the formation of salt
bridges between the proteins.20

A
key element of our model is the loop/turn in the vicinity of
Y192 that allows H10 to contact H5, a conformational motif whose formation
and breaking we propose modulates protein dimerization and lipid binding.
Our cross-linking data support all elements of this model. The existence
of the loop/turn [loop 4 (Figure 4b)] is supported
by cross-links 182–195 and 195–206. Contact of the H5
hairpin with H10 is supported by cross-links 118–226, 118–239,
133–239, and 140–239 (Figure 4b). The H5 hairpin itself is supported by cross-link 118–140
(Figure 4b). Table S1 of the Supporting Information compares cross-linked peptides identified
in this study with those identified by Silva et al.25 and Pollard et al.26 Eight cross-links
are common to all three studies (Figure S8a of the Supporting Information). Of the lysine cross-links identified
in our study that support the H10–H5 contact model (Figure
S8b of the Supporting Information), only
one, cross-link 118–140 indicating a H5 hairpin, is common
to all three studies. None of the other six lysine cross-links found
in our study that support the H10–H5 contact model were reported
by Silva et al.25 or Pollard et al.26 Although it does not directly support the Y192
loop, the ability of Pollard et al.26 to
cross-link L200C and L233C mutations supports our contention that
helix 10 is extremely mobile.

We tested the models experimentally
by reacting monomeric apoA-I
with MDA, which cross-links proteins and also impairs the ABCA1 activity
of lipid-free apoA-I.35 Because MDA creates
cross-links in apoA-I between H10 (C-terminus) and H5,35 cross-linking should hinder apoA-I’s
ability to form discoidal HDL, a key step in reverse cholesterol transport,
by locking H10 to H5, preventing the transition from the closed to
open form (Figure 6). It is significant that
HDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions is modified by MDA
and that elevated levels of MDA-modified HDL have been detected in
blood of subjects with established coronary artery disease. Thus,
activation of the MDA pathway might impair sterol efflux from artery
wall cells in vivo by locking apoA-I into an unfavorable
conformation.35

Other studies suggest
that Tyr192 of lipid-free apoA-I is also
a key regulator of sterol efflux by the ABCA1 pathway.48 In our models, Y192 is the first aromatic residue
in residues 183–243 of the C-terminal fragment of the Borhani
crystal structure that aligns with the aromatic residues of the hydrophobic
cleft of the crystal structure of Mei and Atkinson (Figure 1g). Thus, the π–π interactions
between Y192 and W72 (Figure 1g) may be important
in wrapping the C-terminal fragment around one end of the helix bundle
structure (Figure 7b) to create the H10–H5
juxtaposition that we propose regulates interactions of apoA-I with
lipids. Consistent with this possibility, we have shown that Y192
and the adjacent E191 are the only completely conserved adjacent pair
of residues in apoA-I of the eight completely conserved residues found
in 31 orthologs of apoA-I from mammals to fish.49

Finally, Pollard et al.26 have emphasized
the degree of cross-linking connectivity of K40 to six other residues,
K59, K118, K133, K140, K182, and K239. As shown in Figure 5b, K40 is within a long loop that extends from residue
32 to 55 and is expected to be highly mobile. In fact, three of the
six connected residues, including K239 at the opposite end of the
primary sequence from K40, are &lt;23 Å from K40 in our 15 ns
model, and all six are &lt;17 Å from K40 at some point in the
full trajectory model (Table 5).

In conclusion, we combined portions of the crystal
structures of
human apoA-I of Borhani et al.18 and Mei
and Atkinson27 and used MD simulations
to develop a refined, dynamic structure of lipid-free monomeric human
apoA-I that is consistent with the molten globule state. This model
robustly fits three experimentally determined parameters: (i) domains
predicted to be helical by H/D exchange,40 (ii) spin-coupled residues defining a spatially compact cluster
in the solution structure of monomeric apoA-I,50 and (iii) high-precision mass spectrometry/peptide analysis
with cross-linking chemistry. Because our model, schematically illustrated
in Figure S9 of the Supporting Information, cycles between closed and open states, it suggests a mechanism
whereby monomeric apoA-I might dimerize and interact with lipid during
the process of reverse cholesterol transport. Although our proposed
model is consistent with the existing low-resolution data, it awaits
ultimate experimental verification by higher-resolution methods.
