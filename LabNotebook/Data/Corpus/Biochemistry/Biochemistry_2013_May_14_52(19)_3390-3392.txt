The labeling of Figure A has been corrected.

(A) 3D
representation of r(CCCC) when C1 intercalates between C3 and C4 after
770 ns in the MD simulation with A-form (C3′-endo/anti) starting
structure with the parm99TOR force field; (B) C1 intercalated between
C3 and C4. The distances shown correspond to C1H5–C4H3′
(2.5 Å), C1H5–C3H3′ (2.1 Å), and C1H5–C3H2′
(3.3 Å); (C) 200 ms NOESY of r(CCCC) showing the absence of the
hypothetical H–H cross-peaks, red boxed labels, predicted by
the parm99TOR simulation after 770 ns; (D) typical A-form base stacking
between C1 and C2 (from nucgen structure); (E) the base stacking between
C1 and C3 after C1 intercalates between C3 and C4 observed after 770
ns; (F) the base stacking between C1 and C4 after C1 intercalates
between C3 and C4 observed after 770 ns. The residues C1, C2, C3,
and C4 are green, pink, orange, and cyan, respectively.

The trajectory for δ4 has been replaced with
the correct trajectory (the corrected Figure  in the original Supporting Information appears below).

Time evolution
(in ns) of r(CCCC) with parm99 force field. The starting structure
is A-form r(CCCC) after minimization. Top two plots show the heavy
atom RMS deviations (in Å) of the whole structure and of the
backbone, respectively, relative to A-form r(CCCC). The remaining
plots correspond to the χ and δ dihedral angles for each
residue. A delta dihedral angle, δ, of 78° to 90°
and 140° to 152° correspond to sugar puckers of C3′-endo
and C2′-endo, respectively. Anti, high anti, and syn conformations
were defined by a chi dihedral angle, χ, 180° to 239°,
240° to 300°, and 0° to 120°, respectively.

The trajectory for δ1 has been replaced with the correct trajectory
(the corrected Figure  in the original Supporting
Information appears below).

Time evolution (in ns) of r(CCCC) with parm99
force field. The starting structure is C2′-endo/syn r(CCCC)
after minimization. Top two plots show the heavy atom RMS deviations
(in Å) of the whole structure and of the backbone, respectively,
relative to A-form r(CCCC). The remaining plots correspond to the
χ and δ dihedral angles for each residue. Delta dihedral
angles, δ, of 78° to 90° and 140° to 152°
correspond to sugar puckers of C3′-endo and C2′-endo,
respectively. Anti, high anti, and syn conformations were defined
by a chi dihedral angle, χ, of 180° to 239°, 240°
to 300°, and 0° to 120°, respectively. After 931 ns,
C4 forms a looplike structure with C1 stacking on C4 with
overlapping carbonyls and aminos.
