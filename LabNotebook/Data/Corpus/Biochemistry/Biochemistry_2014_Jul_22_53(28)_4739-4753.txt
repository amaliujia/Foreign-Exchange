Hydrogen
sulfide (H2S) is the newest member of a small family of
gaseous, biological
signaling molecules, termed gasotransmitters. Nitric oxide and carbon
monoxide are the only other currently known gasotransmitters. H2S biosynthesis in mammals is catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase,
cystathionine γ-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase., H2S signaling is implicated in numerous cellular processes− and plays an especially important role in the cardiovascular system
where the gasotransmitter protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury,
regulates blood pressure, promotes angiogenesis, and inhibits plaque
formation.− H2S also acts as a neuromodulator/neuroprotectant and
an oxygen sensor and can induce hibernation-like states in mice.− The emerging paradigm is that H2S signaling is mediated,
at least in part, by protein sulfhydration, a covalent modification
in which cysteine is converted to a persulfide derivative (CysSS–).−

H2S is the only gasotransmitter that is enzymatically
metabolized and the only inorganic compound that can be used by mammalian
mitochondria to generate ATP. H2S metabolism is particularly important because the gasotransmitter
is a Janus-faced molecule that can exhibit toxic effects at supraphysiological
concentrations. The first step in the mitochondrial metabolism of
H2S is catalyzed by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR),
an inner mitochondrial membrane-bound flavoenzyme that catalyzes a
two-electron oxidation of H2S to sulfane sulfur (S0) using coenzyme Q as an electron acceptor.− The enzyme also requires an acceptor
for the sulfane sulfur. Recently, the Jorns lab successfully expressed
human SQOR as a membrane-bound protein in Escherichia coli and identified sulfite (SO32–) as the
physiological acceptor of the sulfane sulfur. This reaction produces thiosulfate (SSO32–) (Scheme , step 1), a known intermediate
in the oxidation of H2S to sulfate by animals or perfused
liver.− Thiosulfate is also a major product of H2S metabolism by colon, a tissue that must detoxify large amounts
of H2S produced by sulfate-reducing bacteria.,

Proposed Scheme for Mammalian Hydrogen Sulfide Metabolism
Abbreviations: SQOR, sulfide:quinone
oxidoreductase; TST, thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase; SDO,
sulfur dioxygenase; SO, sulfite oxidase.

The
identification of thiosulfate as the product of the SQOR reaction
requires a major revision of previously suggested pathways for the
downstream metabolism of the gasotransmitter., We
propose that thiosulfate acts as a substrate for a glutathione-dependent
thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (TST) (Scheme , step 2). The TST reaction produces glutathione persulfide (GSS–) and also regenerates the sulfite consumed in step
1. GSS– is a known substrate for sulfur dioxygenase
(SDO),,, an enzyme
that catalyzes a four-electron oxidation of the sulfane sulfur in
GSS– to produce sulfite (Scheme , step 3). The last step of H2S metabolism may
proceed via one of two competing alternative reactions, a scenario
that can account for observed tissue differences in the final product.
In one path, the sulfite produced in step 3 undergoes a two-electron
oxidation catalyzed by sulfite oxidase (SO) using cytochrome c as an electron acceptor to produce sulfate (Scheme , step 4). This path results in an overall eight-electron
oxidation of 1 mol of H2S to sulfate, the major product
of H2S metabolism in liver. Alternatively, the sulfite
produced in step 3 may be further metabolized by SQOR (Scheme , step 5). This path achieves an overall eight-electron
oxidation of 2 mol of H2S to 1 mol of thiosulfate, the
major metabolic product observed in colon. SQOR and SO exhibit nearly
identical catalytic efficiencies for sulfite utilization (kcat/Km sulfite = 2.11 × 106 and 2.4 × 106 M–1 s–1, respectively),, suggesting that the availability of H2S is likely to
play a key role in the partitioning of sulfite between the two competing
reactions. Consistent with this hypothesis, an elevated level of urinary
excretion of thiosulfate is observed under conditions that result
in pathologically high levels of H2S (e.g., Down’s
syndrome, sublethal environmental exposure to H2S gas,
and ethylmalonic encephalopathy,,) and in patients affected by sulfite oxidase deficiency. The ability to rapidly convert H2S to thiosulfate is forcefully illustrated by the large increase
in blood thiosulfate levels (up to 200-fold) that is observed in fatal
cases of H2S poisoning where death occurs virtually instantaneously,
before thiosulfate can be detected in the urine.

The proposed scheme is consistent with key features
observed for
mammalian metabolism of H2S, including the known catalytic
properties of SQOR, SDO, and SO. Little information is, however, currently
available regarding the postulated TST. Operationally, TST can be
defined as an enzyme that uses thiosulfate to produce sulfite in a
glutathione-dependent reaction. The same operational definition has
been used in studies with enzymes termed thiosulfate reductases (TRs),− a nomenclature that implies that the reactions also generate H2S and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (eq ).For the sake of simplicity, an enzyme that
satisfies the operational definition described above will be termed
a TST with the understanding that additional studies are required
to justify the rigorous use of this terminology.

Although TST
activity is readily detected in liver extracts, attempts
to isolate the mammalian enzyme have not been successful., On the other hand, a TST was purified from Saccharomyces
cerevisiae more than 30 years ago; the corresponding gene
was not, however, identified.− In this paper, we have used bioinformatics
approaches to successfully identify the genes that encode the yeast
TST (RDL1) and the corresponding human ortholog (TSTD1). We provide definitive evidence to show that the
yeast and human enzymes act as genuine TSTs that synthesize and release
GSS– into solution. We present biochemical evidence
of the functional interaction of human SDO with the novel human TST
and its yeast ortholog. Our discovery of bacterial Rosetta Stone proteins
that comprise fusions of human SDO and human TST provides phylogenetic
evidence of the association of the two enzymes.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
All enzymes required for ligation-independent
cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from Gold Biotechnology.
Thiosulfate, glutathione, d,l-homocysteine, coenzyme
A, and d,l-dihydrolipoic acid were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium cyanide and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained
from Fisher. l-Cysteine was obtained from Amresco. Potassium p-toluenethiosulfonate was purchased from TCI scientific.

Expression of Yeast RDL1 in E. coli
Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the RDL1 gene from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA (EMD chemicals).
The reactions were conducted using Taq polymerase (Qiagen) and primers
(see Table S1 of the ) designed to introduce unique NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, as previously described. The Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) was used
to insert the PCR product into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector for blue/white
screening. The screening was conducted using One Shot TOP10 E. coli cells, supplied with the kit, as the host cell.
Plasmid DNA from a white colony was digested with NdeI and XhoI to yield a desired 420 bp fragment that
was subcloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of plasmid pET21b (Novagen). The resulting plasmid, pET21b_rdl1,
was used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to
ampicillin resistance and sequenced across the inset (Genewiz, Inc.).
A starter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET21b_rd1l
cells was prepared by overnight growth at 37 °C in LB medium
containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and used to inoculate 2.5
L flasks containing 1 L of TB medium supplemented with ampicillin
(100 μg/mL). Cells were grown while being shaken at 30 °C.
Expression of yeast RDL1 was induced with IPTG (0.1 mM) when the cell
density reached A595 ∼ 0.6. Cells
were harvested 4 h after induction (∼20 g from 3 L) and stored
at −80 °C.

Purification of Recombinant Yeast RDL1
The enzyme was
purified at 4 °C by a modification of a previously described
protocol. Cells (10 g) were suspended
in 15 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl and 20
mM imidazole-HCl. The cell suspension was mixed with a nuclease/protease
inhibitor cocktail (20 μg/mL DNAase, 20 μg/mL RNAase,
5 mM magnesium sulfate, 12.6 μg/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor,
2 μg/mL aprotinin, 25 μg/mL phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride,
and 3 μg/mL tosyllysine chloromethyl ketone). The cells were
disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation
(10000g for 10 min). The supernatant was mixed with
10 mL of Ni affinity matrix (Talon affinity resin, Qiagen), previously
equilibrated with buffer A [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500
mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole-HCl], and rocked gently for 1 h. The mixture
was poured into a column, which was washed with 4 column volumes of
buffer A. Yeast RDL1 was eluted using a 120 mL linear gradient from
20 to 250 mM imidazole, which was formed with buffer A and buffer
B [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole-HCl].
The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing
50 mM NaCl and 5% (w/v) glycerol. The supernatant, obtained after
centrifugation (30000g for 10 min), was concentrated
using a 5K Macrosep Advance Centrifugal Device (Pall Life Sciences)
and then stored in aliquots at −80 °C.

Expression
of Human TSTD1 Isoforms 1–3 in E.
coli
A synthetic version of the human gene for each
isoform, which had been optimized for expression in E. coli, was obtained from Blue Heron Biotechnology, Inc. (Bothell, WA)
(see Figures S1–S3 of the  for the sequences of synthetic genes). Ligation-independent cloning
was used to add a cleavable (His)6-SUMO tag to the N-terminus
of each synthetic gene. The cloning was conducted by using the PCR
primers listed in Table S1 of the , plasmid pETHSUL (gift from P. Loll), and a protocol similar to
that described by Weeks et al. The resulting
constructs for isoforms 1–3 (pETHSUL_tstd1IF1, pETHSUL_tstd1IF2,
and pETHSUL_tstd1IF3, respectively) were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to ampicillin resistance and sequenced
across each insert (Genewiz, Inc.).

For expression of isoform
1, a starter culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETHSUL_tstd1IF1
cells was prepared by an overnight growth at 37 °C in LB medium
containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and used to inoculate 2 L
flasks containing 1 L of the same medium. Cells were grown while being
shaken at 37 °C. Expression of (His)6-SUMO-tagged
isoform 1 was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG when the cell density reached A595 ∼ 0.6. Cells were harvested 2 h after
induction (∼35 g of cells from 15 L) and stored at −80
°C.

A similar procedure was used for expression of isoform
2 or 3 except
that E. coli cells [BL21(DE3)/pETHSUL_tstd1IF2 or
BL21(DE3)/pETHSUL_tstd1IF3, respectively] were induced with 0.5 mM
IPTG at A595 ∼ 0.6 and harvested
3 h after induction. The yield of cells was similar to that obtained
with isoform 1 (isoform 2, 33 g from 18 L; isoform 3, 31 g from 15
L).

Purification of Recombinant Human TSTD1 Isoforms 1–3
The same procedure was used to purify each isoform, except as noted.
All steps were conducted at 4 °C, following a modification of
a previously described generic protocol. Cells (20 g) were suspended in 35 mL of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
containing 500 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 8 mM imidazole-HCl.
The cell suspension was mixed with a nuclease/protease inhibitor cocktail,
as described above. The cells were disrupted by sonication. Cell debris
was removed by centrifugation (39000g for 10 min).
The supernatant was mixed with 10 mL of Ni affinity matrix (Talon
affinity resin, Qiagen), previously equilibrated with buffer C [25
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 2
mM thiosulfate, and 8 mM imidazole-HCl], and rocked gently for 1 h.
The mixture was poured into a column, which was washed with 4 column
volumes of buffer C. The (His)6-SUMO-tagged TSTD1 isoforms
were eluted with a 20 mL linear gradient from 8 to 250 mM imidazole,
which was formed with buffer C and buffer D [25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
containing 500 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 2 mM thiosulfate, and
250 mM imidazole-HCl]. [In the case of isoform 3, the column eluate
was centrifuged (30000g for 10 min) to remove a small
precipitate.] The peptide bond between the (His)6-SUMO
tag and the N-terminus of each TSTD1 isoform was cleaved using the
UD1 domain of the S. cerevisiae Ulp1 peptidase [0.5%
(v/v)], an engineered SUMO-specific protease containing a C-terminal
(His)6 tag (gift from S. Cocklin).
After a 6 h incubation with gentle rocking at 4 °C, the reaction
mixture was dialyzed against two changes of an ∼60-fold excess
of buffer C. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation (30000g for 10 min) was applied to the Ni affinity matrix column
described above, which had been re-equilibrated with buffer C. Tag-free
TSTD1 isoforms do not bind to the matrix and are recovered in the
column flow-through. The purified isoforms were dialyzed against 50
mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM thiosulfate, and
5% (w/v) glycerol and then centrifuged (30000g for
10 min). The supernatants were stored in aliquots at −80 °C.

Protein Assays
The protein concentration during enzyme
purification was assessed by using a Nano Drop 2000 spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific). All other absorbance measurements were taken using an
Agilent Technologies 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. The concentration
of purified RDL1 (ε280 = 25440 M–1 cm–1) and purified TSTD1 isoforms 1–3 (ε280 = 11460, 11460, and 9970 M–1 cm–1, respectively) was determined using extinction coefficients calculated
using the ProParam tool (http://web.expasy.org/protparam/).

Catalytic Assays with Thiosulfate as the Sulfane Sulfur Donor
and Glutathione as the Acceptor
TST activity during enzyme
purification was monitored using a sulfite end point assay, similar
to that previously described. Briefly,
reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme to assays containing
50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 9.0), 20 mM thiosulfate, and 20 mM glutathione
at 37 °C in a final volume of 500 μL. Assays were quenched
after 2 min by addition of mercuric chloride to a final concentration
of 115 mM and centrifuged. The supernatant was assayed for sulfite
by using a p-rosaniline colorimetric assay (ε570 = 35300 M–1 L–1).

Effect of Sulfur Dioxygenase on Catalytic Assays with Glutathione
and Thiosulfate
Assays were conducted at 37 °C in 50
mM Tris-acetate (pH 9.0) or at 25 °C in 50 mM potassium/sodium
phosphate (pH 8.0) in the presence of 20 mM thiosulfate and 2.4 or
20 mM glutathione. Reactions in the presence or absence of SDO were
initiated by the addition of glutathione, quenched after 2 min, and
assayed for sulfite formation, as described above. Recombinant human
SDO was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)/pMW172ETHE
and purified as previously described. Plasmid pMW172ETHE was obtained as a gift from V. Tiranti.

Steady-State
Kinetic Analysis of the Thiosulfate:Glutathione
Sulfurtransferase Reaction
Steady-state kinetic studies were
performed by using the sulfite end point assay. Studies were conducted
at 37 °C in 50 mM Tris-acetate (pH 9.0) in the absence or presence
of SDO, as indicated. Steady-state kinetic parameters were estimated
by fitting an equation for a sequential mechanism (eq , where A is thiosulfate and B is glutathione) to the data.

Sulfurtransferase Reactions with p-Toluenethiosulfonate
as the Sulfane Sulfur Donor and Glutathione as the Acceptor
Reactions using p-toluenethiosulfonate (p-Tol-SO2S–) as the sulfane
sulfur donor were conducted using 2 mm cuvettes at 25 °C in 50
mM potassium/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Reaction progress was
monitored by following the disappearance of p-Tol-SO2S– at 242 nm (Δε242 = 5080 M–1 cm–1), as described
in the text. The data are not corrected for absorbance changes due
to the conversion of reduced glutathione to glutathione persulfide,
which are likely to be small, as judged by the similar extinction
coefficients determined for reduced and oxidized glutathione (ε242 = 540 and 410 M–1 cm–1, respectively). Reactions were conducted in the absence or presence
of human SDO, as indicated.

Substitution of Glutathione with Alternate
Small Molecule Acceptors
in Sulfurtransferase Reactions with Thiosulfate as the Sulfane Sulfur
Donor
Apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for reactions
in which glutathione was replaced with other thiols (cysteine, coenzyme
A, and DTT) or cyanide were determined by varying the acceptor concentration
at a fixed, saturating concentration of thiosulfate and by varying
the thiosulfate concentration at a fixed, saturating concentration
of the acceptor. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 50 mM Tris-acetate
(pH 9.0) and were initiated by addition of yeast RDL1 or human TSTD1.
Reaction rates with thiol acceptors were determined by monitoring
sulfite formation in an end point assay, as described above. Rates
of reaction with cyanide were determined by using a thiocyanate end
point assay, similar to that previously described. Briefly, reactions were quenched by addition of 5% formaldehyde;
thiocyanate was measured on the basis of the formation of a red complex
upon addition of an acidic solution of ferric nitrate (ε460 = 4300 M–1 cm–1).

Mutation of the Single Cysteine in Yeast RDL1 or Human TSTD1
Isoform 1
PCR site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace
Cys98 in yeast RDL1 or Cys79 in human TSTD1 isoform 1 with Ala or
Ser. PCRs were conducted using pET21b_rd1l or pETHSUL_tstd1IF1 as
a template, PCR Mix (Amresco), Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies),
and the primers listed in Table S1 of the . After treatment with DpnI (New
England Bio Laboratories) to remove template DNA, the PCR products
were used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to
ampicillin resistance and sequenced across the inset (Genewiz, Inc.).
Transformants harboring the mutant plasmids (pET21b_rdl1_C98A, pET21b_rdl1_C98S,
pETHSUL_tstd1 C79A # 6, and pETHSUL_tstd1 C79S # 1) were used to express
and purify the enzyme variants, following the same procedures described
for the corresponding wild-type enzymes.

Detection of Cysteine Persulfide
in Yeast RDL1 or Human TSTD1
Enzyme samples were incubated
for 10 min on ice with 2 mM thiosulfate
and then subjected to gel filtration at 4 °C on a Sephadex G-15
column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).
The protein concentration in the gel eluate was estimated on the basis
of the absorbance at 280 nm. The persulfide concentration in the untreated
eluate and in samples incubated for 10 min at room temperature with
7 mM glutathione and 1.2 μM SDO was determined using the cold
cyanolysis method, as previously described.

Results
Use of Bioinformatics To Identify Potential
Candidate Gene(s)
for Yeast Thiosulfate Sulfurtransferase
Yeast TST is an ∼17000
Da protein that exhibits an isoelectic point of 5.1 and contains a
single cysteine residue, as judged by properties observed for the
natural enzyme isolated from S. cerevisiae more than
30 years ago. We sought to identify potential
candidate gene(s) for yeast TST by searching the S.
cerevisiae genomic database (http://www.yeastgenome.org) for entries annotated as sulfurtransferases, a term used to describe
enzymes that transfer a sulfane sulfur atom from a donor substrate
to a thiophilic acceptor molecule. This search retrieved two genes
of unknown function (RDL1 and RDL2) and seven other genes of known function (TUM1, UBA4, YCH1, NFS1, LIP5, BIO2, and SLM3)
(Table ). An additional gene of known function
(OAC1) was retrieved using thiosulfate as the search
term. Searches performed using other terms (e.g., rhodanese, rhodanese-like
protein, sulfur transfer, thiosulfate cyanide transsulfurase, and
thiosulfate reductase) did not identify any additional candidate genes.
Except for RDL1, all of the retrieved genes could
be eliminated as potential candidates for yeast TST on the basis of
the isoelectric point, molecular weight, and/or cysteine content of
the corresponding gene product (Table ). On
the other hand, the protein encoded by the RDL1 gene
(RDL1) contains a single cysteine and exhibits other properties (MW
= 15.4 kDa; pI = 5.9) remarkably similar to those reported for the
natural TST purified from yeast.

Expression
and Purification of Recombinant Yeast RDL1
We used PCR to
amplify the RDL1 gene from yeast
genomic DNA. The PCR product was subcloned into plasmid pET21b to
introduce a C-terminal His tag. Recombinant RDL1 is strongly expressed
in E. coli and readily isolated by metal affinity
chromatography (Figure ). A typical preparation
yields 50 mg of purified RDL1 from 10 g of cells.

Purification of recombinant
yeast RDL1. The SDS–12% polyacrylamide
gel was stained for protein with ProSieve Blue Protein Staining Solution
(Lonza): lane M, molecular markers; lane 1, whole cell lysate; lane

lane 4, Ni affinity column wash; lane 5, Ni affinity column eluate;
lane 6, dialyzed and concentrated Ni affinity column eluate.

Does Recombinant Yeast
RDL1 Exhibit Thiosulfate:Glutathione
Sulfurtransferase Activity?
The standard TST assay is performed
at pH 9, the optimal pH observed with the natural yeast enzyme. This assay is initiated by the addition of the
enzyme to reaction mixtures containing 20 mM thiosulfate and 20 mM
glutathione. The reaction is quenched after a specified time when
sulfite formation is measured using a colorimetric assay. Using this
assay, we found that RDL1 catalyzed the formation of sulfite in a
reaction that exhibits a linear dependence on time and enzyme concentration
(data not shown).

A complete steady-state kinetic analysis of
the reaction catalyzed by RDL1 was conducted by measuring turnover
rates at various concentrations of thiosulfate and glutathione. Double-reciprocal
plots of reaction rate versus thiosulfate at different concentrations
of glutathione or versus glutathione at different concentrations of
thiosulfate are linear and intersect to the left of the y-axis, just above the x-axis (Figure A,B). The observed intersecting line kinetics are in agreement
with results obtained in previous studies with TST isolated from yeast. Recombinant RDL1 exhibits a 10-fold faster limiting
turnover rate (kcat), but other steady-state
kinetic parameters are nearly identical to values reported for the
natural enzyme isolated from yeast (Table ). The lower turnover rate observed for the natural enzyme is probably
attributable to stability problems encountered during the multiple
steps required to purify TST from yeast. The results provide compelling evidence that the RDL1 gene encodes yeast TST.

Use of Bioinformatics To Identify a Potential Candidate Gene
for Human Thiosulfate Sulfurtransferase
A BLASTp search of
the human genome database using RDL1 as the query sequence retrieved
a single promising candidate gene (TSTD1, thiosulfate
sulfurtransferase rhodanese-like domain containing 1) for the human
ortholog of yeast TST (Table ). The TSTD1 gene contains four exons and is annotated as having
three splice variants (RefSeq mRNAs). The predicted protein isoforms
(TSTD1 isoforms 1–3) differ in size (115, 74, and 109 amino
acids, respectively) but share a common core of 55 amino acids that
contains the single cysteine residue found in each isoform (Figure
S4 of the ). The
TSTD1 isoforms are ∼34% identical (∼52% similar) to
yeast RDL1. The rank ordering of the TSTD1
isoforms by the BLAST algorithm (1 ≫ 3 &gt; 2) is based on
the
calculated Expect value (E) (see Table ) that takes into account both the number of conserved residues
and the length of the RDL1 query sequence that overlaps with each
human isoform.

Expression
and Purification of Recombinant Human TSTD1 Isoforms
1–3
The mRNA for the top-ranking isoform 1 contains
all four of the exons in the TSTD1 gene. We obtained
a synthetic version of the corresponding cDNA that had been optimized
for expression of isoform 1 in E. coli. The synthetic
gene was subcloned into plasmid pET21b to introduce a C-terminal (His)6 tag. The resulting construct was then used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, following a strategy similar to
that used to successfully express recombinant RDL1. However, no expression
of TSTD1 isoform 1 was observed in cell lysates produced under a range
of growth conditions, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis analysis. In an attempt to overcome this difficulty,
we introduced a (His)6-SUMO tag at the N-terminus of the
synthetic gene. The (His)6-SUMO-TSTD1 isoform 1 fusion
protein is strongly expressed in E. coli (Figure , lane 2) and readily purified by metal affinity
chromatography (Figure , lane 5). Quantitative
cleavage of the fusion protein is achieved by digestion with a SUMO-specific
protease (Figure , lanes 6 and 7). Rechromatograpy
of the digest on a metal affinity column yields pure, tag-free TSTD1
isoform 1 (Figure , lanes 8 and 10). We obtained
90 mg of TSTD1 isoform 1 from 20 g of cells.

human TSTD1 isoform 1 with a cleavable

stained for protein with ProSieve Blue Protein Staining Solution (Lonza):
lane M, molecular markers; lane 1, crude cell lysate; lane 2, low-speed
supernatant; lane 3, Ni affinity column flow-through; lane 4, Ni affinity

sample after dialysis; lane 8, second Ni affinity column flow-through;
lane 9, second Ni affinity column eluate; lane 10, dialyzed sample
from lane 8.

The mRNA for the smallest
isoform 2 lacks exon 2 but contains the
other three exons of the TSTD1 gene. A different
exon is missing in the mRNA that encodes isoform 3 (exon 4). Additionally,
intron 3 is retained in the mRNA for isoform 3 and encodes a predicted
decapeptide at the C-terminus of the protein (see Figure S4 of the ). Isoforms 2 and 3 were
successfully expressed as SUMO fusion proteins and readily isolated,
as described in  and
shown in Figures S5 and S6 of the . We obtained 68 mg of TSTD1 isoform 2 and 54 mg of TSTD1 isoform
3 from 20 g of cells.

Do Human TSTD1 Isoforms 1–3 Exhibit
Thiosulfate:Glutathione
Sulfurtransferase Activity?
A survey was conducted using
the standard TST assay to determine whether activity could be detected
with any of the human TSTD1 isoforms. Isoform 1 was found to catalyze
the conversion of thiosulfate to sulfite in a glutathione-dependent
reaction that exhibits a linear dependence on time and enzyme concentration
(data not shown). In contrast, neither of the other two TSTD1 isoforms
exhibits detectable TST activity. The results with isoform 2 suggest
that the peptide encoded by exon 2 is essential for the activity observed
with isoform 1. The absence of activity with isoform 3 may reflect
the loss of the peptide encoded by exon 4 and/or the translation of
retained intron 3. It is worth noting that catalytically inactive
isoforms are known to exhibit a regulatory function in metabolism. This intriguing possibility is, however, beyond
the scope of this investigation. Instead, our studies have focused
on isoform 1, as described below.

A complete steady-state kinetic
analysis of the thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase reaction
catalyzed by TSTD1 isoform 1 was conducted at pH 9.0 (37 °C).
Double-reciprocal plots of reaction rate versus thiosulfate or glutathione
intersect to the left of the y-axis, just above the x-axis (Figure ), as observed with
yeast RDL1. The human enzyme exhibits catalytic parameters fairly
similar to those of RDL1, except that turnover is ∼25-fold
slower (Table ). The results show that the TSTD1 gene encodes the human ortholog of yeast TST. Catalytically
active isoform 1 will henceforth be termed human TSTD1.

kinetic analysis of the thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase
reaction catalyzed by recombinant human TSTD1. Reactions were conducted
in 50 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 9.0) at 37 °C. (A) Data obtained
with 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 15 mM glutathione are shown by the black,
red, green, blue, and magenta circles, respectively. (B) Data obtained
with 5, 10, 20, and 55 mM thiosulfate are shown by the black, red,
green, and blue circles, respectively. The solid lines in panels A
and B were obtained by fitting eq  to the data.

Use of Sulfur Dioxygenase
To Distinguish between Thiosulfate:Glutathione
Sulfurtransferase and Thiosulfate Reductase Activity
TSTs
and TRs both catalyze the glutathione-dependent conversion of thiosulfate
to sulfite. The TST reaction is, however, accompanied by the formation
of a stoichiometric amount of glutathione persulfide (GSS–). Formation of GSS– as a product is a feature
that uniquely distinguishes between TSTs (eq ) and TRs (eq ). SDO catalyzes the oxidation
of the sulfane sulfur in GSS– to produce sulfite
(eq ).Consequently,
addition of SDO to assays containing
thiosulfate and glutathione should cause a 2-fold increase in the
rate of sulfite formation observed with an authentic TST (eq )whereas the rate observed with a
TR should
be unaffected.

Indeed, a 2-fold increase in the rate of sulfite
formation is observed with TSTD1 or RDL1 upon addition of excess SDO
to the standard TST assay (pH 9 and 37 °C) that contains 20 mM
thiosulfate and 20 mM glutathione (Figure A). A very similar effect is observed in assays containing the same
substrate concentrations but conducted at a lower pH (pH 8.0) and
a lower temperature (25 °C) (Figure B).
However, much larger rate increases (4–9-fold) are observed
upon addition of SDO to assays containing 2.4 mM glutathione. The
greater than anticipated rate enhancements at the lower glutathione
concentration are observed in assays with TSTD1 or RDL1 at pH 9 or
8 (Figure ). The observed increase in the
rate of sulfite formation in SDO-coupled assays at 2.4 mM glutathione
corresponds to a 2–4.5-fold increase in the rate of the sulfurtransferase
reaction (eq ).

Effect of human SDO on
thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase
reactions catalyzed by human TSTD1 or yeast RDL1. Reactions were conducted
in 50 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 9.0) at 37 °C (A) or 50 mM sodium/potassium
phosphate (pH 8.0) at 25 °C (B). Assays containing 20 mM thiosulfate
and 20 mM (solid filled bars) or 2.4 mM (diagonally striped bars)
glutathione were conducted in the absence or presence of 4 μM
(A) or 800 nM (B) SDO. The bar graph shows the rate increase (fold)
calculated by dividing values observed in the presence of SDO by those
obtained for the same reaction in the absence of SDO.

The results provide definitive evidence that TSTD1
and RDL1 are
authentic TSTs that catalyze the formation of GSS– as a product that is released into solution (eq ). The data also indicate the GSS– is a
potent inhibitor of both the human and yeast enzymes. The fact that
inhibition by GSS– is observed at lower but not
higher glutathione concentrations suggests that the product acts as
a competitive inhibitor with respect to glutathione.

Steady-State
Kinetics of the Reaction of Yeast RDL1 or Human
TSTD1 with Thiosulfate and Glutathione in the Presence of Sulfur Dioxygenase
Intersecting line double-reciprocal plots are obtained for the
yeast RDL1 reaction in the presence of SDO (Figure C,D), as observed in the absence of SDO. The presence of SDO
results in a 25-fold decrease in the Km value obtained for glutathione, whereas only modest changes are
observed for other steady-state kinetic parameters (Table ). A complete steady-state kinetic analysis of the
TSTD1 reaction in the presence of SDO is not possible because of a
large decrease in the Km value for glutathione
(&lt;0.04 mM). It is worth noting that SDO causes only minor changes
in the TSTD1 turnover rate or the Km for
thiosulfate, as judged by apparent steady-state kinetic parameters
obtained by varying the concentration of thiosulfate at a saturating
concentration of glutathione (Table ). The
decreased Km value for glutathione observed
with RDL1 or TSTD1 in the presence of SDO is consistent with the hypothesis
that GSS– is a potent competitive inhibitor with
respect to glutathione.

Reaction of Yeast RDL1 or Human TSTD1 with
a Chromogenic Substrate
as an Alternate Sulfane Sulfur Donor
p-Toluenethiosulfonate
(p-Tol-SO2S–) is a more
reactive sulfane sulfur donor than thiosulfate. The compound exhibits a moderately intense absorption band
in the UV region (ε242 = 6760 M–1 cm–1) that is lost
upon transfer of the sulfane sulfur to an acceptor and formation of p-toluenesulfinate (p-Tol-SO2–) (Figure S7 of the ). Consequently, the reaction with p-Tol-SO2S– as the sulfane donor can
be monitored by measuring the disappearance of the substrate at 242
nm (Δε242 = 5080 M–1 cm–1). This continuous spectrophotometric assay is less
cumbersome than the fixed time point assay used to monitor sulfite
formation with thiosulfate as the donor.

To minimize the blank
rate with the more reactive donor, assays with p-Tol-SO2S– and glutathione are conducted at a pH
(pH 8.0) and temperature (25 °C) lower than those of the standard
TST assay with thiosulfate as the donor (pH 9.0 and 37 °C, respectively).
Human TSTD1 and yeast RDL1 exhibit p-Tol-SO2S–:glutathione sulfurtransferase activity; the
observed initial rates of these reactions are directly proportional
to the enzyme concentration (Figure A,B).
Apparent turnover rates for the TSTD1 and RDL1 reactions were estimated
from the slopes of these plots (kcat app = 96 ± 5 and 104 ± 3 s–1, respectively).
It is worth noting that replacing thiosulfate with p-Tol-SO2S– appears to eliminate the
difference in the turnover rate of the human and yeast enzymes that
is observed with the less reactive donor (see Table ).

Reaction of recombinant yeast RDL1 or human TSTD1 with p-toluenethiosulfonate (p-Tol-SO2S–) and glutathione as the sulfane sulfur donor
and acceptor, respectively. Reactions were conducted at 25 °C
using 2 mm cuvettes in 50 mM potassium/sodium phosphate buffer (pH
8.0) containing 0.75 mM p-Tol-SO2S– and 2.4 mM glutathione, with enzyme(s), as indicated.
(A and B) The plots show the effect of the concentration of yeast
RDL1 or human TSTD1 on the velocity observed during the initial 20
s of reactions conducted in the absence of SDO. The data are corrected
for the blank rate observed in the absence of enzyme. (C and D) The
plots show the effect of SDO (368 nM) on the extent of the reaction
observed with 40.8 nM RDL1 and 80.3 nM TSTD1, respectively. In each
panel, curve 1 is the blank reaction, curves 2 and 3 were obtained
for the reactions with RDL1 and TSTD1 in the absence and presence
of SDO, respectively, and the dotted line (curve 4) shows the absorbance
change calculated for 100% conversion of p-Tol-SO2S– to p-Tol-SO2–. The first data point in curves 2 and 3 in panels
C and D corresponds to the absorbance of p-Tol-SO2S–, observed immediately prior to the addition
of enzyme. The apparent gap between the first and subsequent data
points is due to the enzyme reaction that occurs during mixing (&lt;5
s), before readings can be taken.

A 2.3- or 2.0-fold increase in the initial rate of disappearance
of p-Tol-SO2S– is observed
when assays with RDL1 or TSTD1, respectively, are conducted in the
presence of SDO (Figure C,D). The observed
rate enhancements are similar to those seen in assays at the same
glutathione concentration (2.4 mM) with thiosulfate as the sulfane
sulfur donor. In addition to the effect on initial rates, SDO causes
a dramatic change in the extent of the reactions observed with p-Tol-SO2S–. In the absence
of SDO, the reactions with RDL1 and TSTD1 appear to be complete in
∼200 s, as judged by the observed plateau in the progress curves
(Figure C,D, curve 2). However, the maximal
ΔA242 observed with either enzyme
is only 50% of that expected for the complete consumption of p-Tol-SO2S–, as indicated by
the dotted lines (curve 4) in panels C and D of Figure . The observed progress curves suggested that the reactions
may have reached equilibrium after 200 s (eq ).Consistent with this hypothesis,
a quantitative
conversion of p-Tol-SO2S– to p-Tol-SO2– is observed
when GSS– is oxidatively decomposed, as judged by
the reaction traces obtained for the RDL1 and TSTD1 reactions in the
presence of SDO (Figure C,D, curve 3).

Reaction
of Yeast RDL1 or Human TSTD1 with Alternate Sulfane
Sulfur Acceptors
We investigated the specificity of yeast
RDL1 and human TSTD1 with respect to the sulfane sulfur acceptor by
determining whether alternate acceptors could substitute for glutathione.
We surveyed four physiologically relevant thiols and two nonphysiological
compounds in reactions conducted at pH 9.0 with thiosulfate as the
sulfane sulfur donor. Activity was observed with RDL1 or TSTD1 using l-cysteine, coenzyme A, DTT, or cyanide as the acceptor. No
activity was, however, detected with d,l-homocysteine
or d,l-dihydrolipoic acid.

Apparent steady-state
kinetic parameters for reactions observed with different acceptors
were determined by varying the acceptor concentration in the presence
of a saturating concentration of thiosulfate and vice versa. The observed
velocities exhibit a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of
the varied substrate except for the reaction with RDL1 when thiosulfate
is varied at a saturating concentration of coenzyme A. In this case,
a sigmoidal dependence on the thiosulfate concentration is observed.
Varying the nature of the acceptor causes only modest changes (≤3.5-fold)
in the apparent turnover rate or the Km for thiosulfate, as judged by results obtained for the RDL1 or TSTD1
reactions with glutathione and four alternate acceptors (Table ). Similar Km values
are observed for l-cysteine and glutathione with RDL1 or
TSTD1. The Km value obtained for coenzyme
A with RDL1 or TSTD1 is, however, 40- or 20-fold lower, respectively,
than the Km value observed for glutathione.
The potential significance of the observed Km values will be discussed.

Role of the
Single Cysteine Residue in Yeast RDL1 or Human TSTD1
Yeast
RDL1 and human TSTD1 exhibit a signature motif characteristic
of a rhodanese homology domain (RHOD). This αβ fold domain
is found in other sulfurtransferases and is also observed in the crystal
structure of RDL1, which was determined as part of a structural genomics
initiative and published as Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3D1P. An invariant cysteine
occupies the first position of a six-amino acid active site loop observed
in other RHOD-containing sulfurtransferases. The single cysteine in yeast RDL1 (Cys98) occupies the same location
within an active site loop found in the crystal structure of the protein
(Figure , top panel). A sequence alignment
indicates that the putative catalytic cysteine and three other residues
in the active site loop of yeast RDL1 are conserved in human TSTD1
(Figure , bottom panel).

Active site loop and
putative catalytic cysteine in RDL1 and TSTD1.
The top panel is a stereo ribbon drawing of yeast RDL1 (PDB entry 3D1P), which is shown
as a magenta ribbon, except for the white active site loop. Cys98
is shown in ball and stick form. The bottom panel shows a region of
a sequence alignment of RDL1 and TSTD1 around the putative catalytic
cysteine (Cys98 and Cys79, respectively), which is located at the
first position of the six-amino acid active site loop.

To evaluate the possible catalytic role of Cys98
in yeast RDL1
and Cys79 in human TSTD1, we mutated each residue to Ala or Ser. The
mutations did not affect protein expression. However, each of the
purified mutant enzymes was found to be catalytically inactive. The
results provide compelling evidence that the single cysteine in the
yeast and human enzymes is catalytically essential. In contrast, Chancey
and Westley concluded that the cysteine was not required for catalysis
by the yeast enzyme based on the failure of iodoacetate to inactivate
the enzyme. Unfortunately, the postulated
site of iodoacetate incorporation was not identified in this study.

The mutagenesis results suggested that catalysis by yeast RDL1
and human TSTD1 might occur via a double-displacement mechanism involving
transfer of the sulfane sulfur from thiosulfate to the active site
cysteine (eq ) and subsequent reaction of the
persulfide-containing intermediate with glutathione (eq 7). Evidence for evaluating this hypothesis was
sought by determining whether cyanolyzable sulfur could be detected
in the enzyme isolated by gel filtration after a short incubation
with thiosulfate. We found that ∼10 or ∼20% of the cysteine
in the column eluate of RDL1 or TSTD1, respectively, is present as
cysteine persulfide. The persulfide is largely eliminated upon incubation
of the isolated intermediates with glutathione in the presence of
SDO, which was included to oxidize the cyanolyzable sulfur in the
GSS– product (Table ).

Identification of Bacterial
SDO–TSTD1 Fusion Proteins
Rosetta Stone proteins are
fusion proteins consisting of two nonhomologous
proteins that are found as separate proteins in another genome. The
fusion is thought to be maintained by selection because it facilitates
a functional interaction between proteins, such as the kinetic coupling
of consecutive enzymes in a pathway. Six
bacterial proteins were previously classified as fusions of SDO with
rhodanese, a thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase encoded by the TST gene., The functional interaction between
human TSTD1 and human SDO observed in this study led us to question
the validity of this assignment. Accordingly, we performed BLASTp
searches of the human genome database using each of the putative SDO–rhodanese
fusion proteins as the query sequence. Contrary to the previous classification,
TSTD1 was the top-scoring BLAST hit for the C-terminal domain in all
six proteins (Table , entries 2, 4, 10, 11,
14, and 15). Furthermore, rhodanese was not found among the lower-scoring
BLAST hits for the C-terminal domain. On the other hand, SDO was the
highest-scoring BLAST hit for the N-terminal domain in each query
sequence. The results indicate that all six bacterial proteins are
more appropriately classified as fusions of SDO and TSTD1.

Proteins previously classified as
fusions of SDO with rhodanese.,

We reasoned that the six SDO–TSTD1
fusion proteins might
be part of a larger group of homologous Rosetta Stone proteins. To
evaluate this hypothesis, the fusion protein from M. tundripaludum (Table , entry 4) was used as the query
sequence in a BLASTp search against all nonredundant GenBank CDS translations,
with the maximal number of target sequences set to 500. The search
retrieved 116 bacterial proteins that exhibit 96–99% coverage
with the query sequence and low E values (3 ×
10–65 and 9 × 10–165), properties
expected for homologues of the M. tundripaludum SDO–TSTD1
fusion protein. We performed BLASTp searches
against the human genome using query sequences from a selected subset
of the 116 hits that included no more than one representative species
from within each genus. Satisfyingly, SDO and TSTD1 were the highest-scoring
BLAST hits obtained for the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively,
in each tested query. The newly identified fusion proteins were rank-ordered
with respect to the E values obtained for the TSTD1
hits; those exhibiting E values of ≤6 ×
10–4 are listed in Table .

Are Human-like SQORs Found in Bacteria That Express SDO–TSTD1
Fusion Proteins?
H2S and thiosulfate are the most
abundant reduced inorganic sulfur species in the environment. Bacteria that express SDO–TSTD1 fusion
proteins might utilize exogenously derived thiosulfate as the substrate
for the TSTD1 reaction. Alternatively, these bacteria might contain
human-like SQORs that initiate the oxidation of H2S and
produce an endogenous source of thiosulfate for the TSTD1 reaction,
analogous to that proposed for mammalian H2S metabolism
(see Scheme ).

The proteomes of 12 of
the 13 bacteria that harbor top-scoring SDO–TSTD1 fusion proteins
are available in the NCBI database (Table , entries 1–10 and 12–13). We conducted BLASTp searches
of these proteomes using human SQOR as the query sequence. The searches
identified SQOR homologues in 11 of the 12 searchable proteomes (Table
S2 of the ). Complete
genomic data are available for two of the 11 bacteria that contain
both SQOR and SDO–TSTD1 fusion proteins (N. oceani and N. watsonii); whole-genome shotgun contigs
are available for the other nine bacteria. The genes for SQOR and
the SDO–TSTD1 fusion protein in N. oceani and N. watsonii are transcribed in the same direction and separated
by just 73 nucleotides. Although not predicted to lie in the same
operon, the genes for the two proteins in N. oceani are considered to be functionally related as part of a regulon cluster,
according to MicrobesOnline (http://www.microbesonline.org/operons/). Genomic distances could also be determined in four other bacteria
where the genes for SQOR and the SDO–TSTD1 fusion protein were
found within the same contig. In these cases, the genes were separated
by 21–246 nucleotides (Table S2 of the ).

Seven of the 11 identified
bacterial SQORs, including the N. oceani and N. watsonii enzymes, are
highly similar to human SQOR (E ≤ 5 ×
10–90) (see Table S2 of the ). SQORs have been classified into six
types. A phylogenetic tree shows that
the seven top-scoring bacterial enzymes cluster with type II SQORs,
a category that includes all known eukaryotic SQORs and a subset of
prokaryotic enzymes (Figure ). The lower-scoring
hits include one that clusters with type I bacterial SQORs and three
that did not cluster with representatives of other known types of
bacterial SQORs (not shown).

of 31 homologues was performed using COBALT (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/). The alignment included 11 SQORs produced in bacteria that express
SDO–TSTD1 fusion proteins (see Table S2 of the ) and 20 previously identified
type I and type II SQORs. The phylogenetic
tree was rendered using the Newick file generated by COBALT and the
online PHY·FI application (http://cgi-www.cs.au.dk/cgi-chili/phyfi/go). The red boxes
mark the 11 SQOR homologues found in bacteria that express SDO–TSTD1
fusion proteins. Starting from the upper left-hand corner of the tree,
the bacterial sequences include enzymes from Bradyrhizobiaceae
bacterium, Afipia broomeae, Mesorhizobium
amorphae, Methylocystis rosea, Rhodobacter
capsulatus, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Aquifex aeolicus, Pseudomonas putida, Rhizobium giardinii, Ralstonia solanacearum, Nitrosococcus oceani, Nitrosococcus watsonii, Methylobacter tundripaludum, Methyloglobulus
morosus, Methylomicrobium album, Methylosarcina fibrata, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The eukaryotic sequences include SQORs from Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, Arenicola marina (lugworm), and various
higher eukaryotic animals, as indicated.

Discussion
The first step in mammalian H2S metabolism was previously
postulated to produce the GSS– substrate for SDO,
an enzyme thought to catalyze the second step in the pathway., This hypothesis was contradicted by the discovery that glutathione
does not act as an acceptor of the sulfane sulfur generated during
H2S oxidation by human SQOR. Instead, SQOR catalyzes the
oxidative conversion of H2S to thiosulfate, a reaction
in which sulfite acts as the sulfane sulfur acceptor from an enzyme
persulfide intermediate (E–CysSS– + SO32– ⇒ E–CysS– + SSO32–). The inability of SQOR to produce GSS– led others
to suggest that SDO might directly oxidize the sulfane sulfur in the
persulfide intermediate (E–CysSS– + O2 + H2O ⇒ E–CysS– + SO32– + 2H+). However, human SDO cannot replace sulfite in
the SQOR reaction, as judged by its inability to accelerate the slow
rate of H2S oxidation observed in the absence of sulfite., The results strongly
suggested that a thiosulfate:glutathione sulfurtransferase was required
to provide the missing link between the SQOR and SDO reactions.

Although TST could be purified from S. cerevisiae,− attempts to isolate the mammalian enzyme were not successful., We used bioinformatic approaches to identify the genes that encode
human TST (TSTD1) and its yeast ortholog (RDL1). Both genes produce small RHOD-containing proteins.
Recombinant yeast RDL1 catalyzes the glutathione-dependent conversion
of thiosulfate to sulfite in a reaction that proceeds via a ternary
complex mechanism and exhibits steady-state kinetic parameters similar
to those reported for the natural yeast enzyme. The human TSTD1 gene contains four exons
and has three splice variants. TSTD1 isoform 1 is produced from a
transcript that contains all four exons and exhibits TST activity;
the smaller TSTD1 isoforms are catalytically inactive. TSTD1 (isoform
1) exhibits steady-state kinetic parameters similar to those of RDL1,
except that turnover of the human enzyme is ∼25-fold slower.
Proteomics studies indicate that human TSTD1 is highly expressed in
various tissues, including liver and heart., Data for the individual isoforms are unavailable except in tumor
cell lines where only isoform 1 is detected by Western blotting.

Yeast RDL1 and human TSTD1 contain a single
cysteine (Cys98 and
Cys79, respectively) that is catalytically essential, as judged by
the loss of activity observed when the cysteines are replaced with
serine or alanine. The detection of albeit modest amounts of cysteine
persulfide in the human or yeast enzyme isolated after reaction with
thiosulfate suggests that catalysis occurs via a double-displacement
mechanism involving the formation of a cysteine persulfide-containing
intermediate (see eqs  and 7), as observed
with other RHOD-containing sulfurtransferases.,,, Formation
of the persulfide intermediate may be rate-limiting during catalysis
by human TSTD1, as judged by the substantial increase in turnover
rate observed when thiosulfate is replaced with a more reactive sulfane
donor, p-Tol-SO2S–.
Coenzyme A and l-cysteine can act as alternate sulfane sulfur
acceptors for the yeast and mammalian enzymes. Human TSTD1 exhibits Km values for glutathione and coenzyme A that
are below or within the normal range reported for the concentrations
of these thiols in animal cells., The Km value obtained for l-cysteine is,
however, 1 order of magnitude higher than the l-cysteine
level in liver cells. The results suggest
that coenzyme A, but not l-cysteine, may be a possibly significant
alternate acceptor for TSTD1 in mammalian cells. It is worth noting
that coenzyme A persulfide is the only currently known alternate (albeit
poor) substrate for human SDO.

Functional
Interaction between Human SDO and Human TSTD1 or
Yeast RDL1
The operational definition of a TST as an enzyme
that catalyzes a glutathione-dependent conversion of thiosulfate to
sulfite does not distinguish between an authentic TST that produces
GSS– as a product and a TR that catalyzes a glutathione-dependent
reduction of thiosulfate to sulfite and H2S. Definitive
evidence that TSTD1 and RDL1 are authentic TSTs is provided by studies
that show that the reaction product is oxidized by human SDO, as evidenced
by an expected doubling of the rate of sulfite formation upon addition
of SDO to assays at a saturating glutathione concentration. The greater than expected rate accelerations observed
when SDO is added to assays at lower glutathione concentrations indicate
that GSS– is an inhibitor of the yeast and human
enzymes. The presence of SDO results in a ≥25-fold decrease
in the Km value obtained for glutathione
with RDL1 or TSTD1, suggesting that GSS– is a potent
competitive inhibitor with respect to glutathione. SDO also enhances
the initial rate of glutathione-dependent sulfurtransferase reactions
observed with p-Tol-SO2S– as the sulfane sulfur donor. The observed inhibition of the TST
reactions by GSS–, which is circumvented in the
presence of human SDO, provides an apparent mechanism for regulating
mammalian GSS– biosynthesis and preventing the accumulation
of a highly reactive metabolite.

The reactions observed with p-Tol-SO2S– and TSTD1 or RDL1
in the absence of SDO reach equilibrium when ∼50% of the substrate
has been consumed. A quantitative conversion of p-Tol-SO2S– to p-Tol-SO2– is, however, observed when GSS– is oxidatively decomposed in the presence of SDO. The ability of
human SDO to drive the reaction with a reactive sulfane sulfur donor
to completion provides a paradigm for the thermodynamic coupling of
the irreversible SDO reaction with the less favorable, but physiologically
relevant, sulfurtransferase reaction with thiosulfate as the sulfane
donor.

The effect of SDO on the extent of the reaction with p-Tol-SO2S– is similar to that
reported
in a previous study with the natural yeast TST for the effect of cyanide
on the extent of a reaction observed with glutathione and benzenethiosulfonate
(Ph-SO2S–). However, the authors attributed the observed formation of a stoichiometric
amount of thiocyanate to the reaction of cyanide with GSS– that had been released into solution. This interpretation is rendered
problematic by the fact that cyanide is an alternate substrate for
yeast TST, as shown by results obtained in this study and in a previous
survey of the thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase activity exhibited
by RHOD-containing yeast proteins.

Phylogenetic Association of Human TSTD1 and Human SDO
Using
bioinformatics approaches, we identified a group of bacterial
SDO–TSTD1 fusion proteins that includes six members previously
misclassified as SDO–rhodanese fusions. The C-terminal TSTD1-like
domain in the fusion proteins is connected to the N-terminal SDO-like
domain by a variable-length linker region (Figure S8 of the ). Catalytically important
residues and signature motifs are conserved between the respective
bacterial domains and human TSTD1 or SDO, as judged by multiple-sequence
alignments of the bacterial domains with the human proteins (Figure
S9 of the ). The
phylogenetic data reinforce the biochemical evidence obtained for
the functional interaction of human TSTD1 and SDO.

It is worth
noting that at least some of the bacteria that express SDO–TSTD1
fusion proteins also contain an adjacent gene that encodes a human-like
SQOR. The results suggest that these organisms metabolize H2S via a pathway that is strikingly similar to the first three steps
proposed for mammalian H2S metabolism (see Scheme ). The metabolic similarity
is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective given that the
genes for H2S metabolism were acquired by eukaryotic cells
from an endosymbiotic bacterial ancestor. Nevertheless, bacteria and
mammals exhibit considerable divergence with respect to the role of
H2S metabolism. Bacterial metabolism of environmental H2S provides an important source of energy and reducing equivalents.
In contrast, the primary physiological significance of H2S metabolism in mammals is closely tied to the acquired role of endogenously
produced H2S as an important signaling molecule.

Concluding
Remarks
In summary, we describe a novel human sulfurtransferase
that catalyzes
the formation of a central intermediate in mammalian H2S metabolism. We propose that human TSTD1 constitutes the hitherto
missing link between the reactions catalyzed by SQOR and SDO. The
biosynthesis of glutathione persulfide by human TSTD1 provides a rare
example of a mammalian enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of a
reactive sulfane sulfur donor that is released into solution. In this regard, it is worth noting that glutathione
persulfide and polysulfides have been found to mediate protein sulfhydration., It has recently been suggested that persulfides and other reactive
sulfane sulfur donors may be the actual signaling molecules that implement
many of the biological effects previously attributed to H2S.,, Additional
studies are clearly required to evaluate the intriguing possibility
that H2S metabolism may have an unanticipated direct role
in H2S signaling.

Similar negative
results were obtained
with coenzyme A, which was tested because the corresponding persulfide
is an alternate, albeit poor, substrate for SDO.

Oxidation of GSS– by SDO can also be detected by measuring oxygen consumption
using
an oxygen electrode-based TSTD1–SDO coupled assay (S. L. Melideo
and M. S. Jorns, unpublished observations).

The SDO–TSTD1 fusion proteins
may also function in the bacterial oxidation of environmental thiosulfate,
providing an alternative to the widely distributed Sox (sulfur oxidizing)
system.

Very recent studies show that a reactive
sulfane sulfur donor is produced by two other mammalian enzymes (cystathione
β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase), which catalyze
the conversion of cystine to cysteine persulfide.
