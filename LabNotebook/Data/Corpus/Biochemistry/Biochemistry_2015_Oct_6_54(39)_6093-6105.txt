The
Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenases comprise
a large and diverse enzyme superfamily the members of which have multiple
physiological roles. Despite this diversity, these enzymes share a
common chemical mechanism and a core structural fold, a double-stranded
β-helix (DSBH), as well as conserved active site residues. The
prolyl hydroxylases are members of this large superfamily. Prolyl
hydroxylases are involved in collagen biosynthesis and oxygen sensing
in mammalian cells. Structural–mechanistic studies with prolyl
hydroxylases have broader implications for understanding mechanisms
in the Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. Here, we
describe crystal structures of an N-terminally truncated viral collagen
prolyl hydroxylase (vCPH). The crystal structure shows that vCPH contains
the conserved DSBH motif and iron binding active site residues of
2-OG oxygenases. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to delineate
structural changes in vCPH upon binding its substrate. Kinetic investigations
are used to report on reaction cycle intermediates and compare them
to the closest homologues of vCPH. The study highlights the utility
of vCPH as a model enzyme for broader mechanistic analysis of Fe(II)-
and 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, including those of biomedical interest.

Prolyl hydroxylases are members
of the large and diverse superfamily of enzymes, the Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate
(2-OG)-dependent dioxygenases.1 Enzymes
from the 2-OG oxygenase superfamily catalyze a large and diverse range
of reactions and have a variety of physiological roles.2−4 Examples include antibiotic synthesis in microorganisms,5 histone modifications,6 and DNA repair/RNA modification.7,8 Despite this
diversity of roles, these enzymes share a common reaction mechanism
(Figure 1).1 They utilize Fe(II) and the cosubstrate 2-OG
in the active site to activate oxygen, resulting in the two-electron
oxidation of the substrate. This is coupled to the decarboxylation
of 2-OG to produce carbon dioxide and succinate (Figure 1). This oxidative decarboxylation
of 2-OG yields a highly reactive Fe(IV) intermediate, which is responsible
for abstraction of hydrogen from the substrate.9,10 As
well as a conserved reaction mechanism, these enzymes have a highly
conserved double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) domain that supports
a highly conserved HXD/E···H iron binding motif.11,12 The selectivity of individual enzymes is dictated by additional
motifs that surround the DSBH core.

Figure 1 Mechanism of the Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent
dioxygenases. In its
resting position, the enzyme active site contains a ferrous iron ion
coordinated by two His residues and one Asp residue (step I). The
binding of 2-OG displaces two water molecules (step II); binding of
a third water molecule is displaced/weakened upon substrate binding
(step III). Substrate binding allows oxygen binding, which subsequently
forms an anionic intermediate (step IV) that attacks the ketone of
2-OG to form a cyclic peroxide molecule (step V). The collapse of
this intermediate causes formation of the Fe(IV)oxo species, which
abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate (step VI). The substrate radical
then reacts with the Fe(III)–OH complex to form the hydroxylated
substrate (step VII) and restores the enzyme to the resting position.

Prolyl hydroxylases catalyze the
hydroxylation of proline residues
in proteins and peptides. This post-translational modification is
important in cellular oxygen sensing, collagen biosynthesis, and ribosomal
protein synthesis by the action of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins
(PHDs), collagen prolyl hydroxylases, and the ribosomal prolyl-3-hydroxylase
OGFOD1,13 respectively. In humans, there
are three PHD enzymes (PHD1–3) that modulate the stability
of isoforms of the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a transcription
factor responsible for regulation of genes involved in the hypoxic
response.14,15 Of the three PHD enzymes, PHD2 is the most
important in oxygen sensing,16,17 and studies of PHD2
have characterized its unusually slow reaction with oxygen, relative
to other Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases, which is thought
to be important in its role as an oxygen sensor.18

The mammalian tetrameric collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylases
(C-P4H)
target X-Pro-Gly repeats in procollagen polypeptides, leading to the
increased stability of the collagen triple helix.19 Hydroxylation of collagen-like domains and proline-rich
proteins also occurs in plants and algae, and various prolyl hydroxylases
have been identified. These enzymes are generally smaller and monomeric
compared to the mammalian collagen prolyl hydroxylases. They also
differ in terms of substrate specificity and can hydroxylate different
sequences of proline-rich peptides.19 Many
of the plant prolyl hydroxylases are thought to be involved in the
production of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs), major components
of plant cell walls as well as other cellular functions.19

A viral collagen prolyl hydroxylase from Paramecium bursaria Chlorella Virus-1 (PBCV-1) was first
described by Eriksson and co-workers.20 The enzyme has a distinct sequence similarity
(between 15 and 23% identity) with the C-terminal half of the α-subunit
of animal collagen prolyl hydroxylases. Substrates for the enzyme
were determined after sequence analysis of the PBCV-1 genome highlighted many open reading frames for proteins containing
regions of proline-rich repeats, similar to the collagen prolyl hydroxylase
substrates.20 Hoffart et al. have shown
that during the reaction cycle a high-spin Fe(IV) intermediate forms,
which is responsible for the abstraction of hydrogen from substrate
(Figure 1).9 High-spin Fe(IV) intermediates are often transient
in nature and therefore difficult to characterize. That this intermediate
can be observed makes mechanistic analysis of the enzymatic reaction
cycle accessible. The enzyme is relatively small for a 2-OG oxygenase
(25 kDa) and is a monomeric protein. It is soluble at high concentrations
and can be tagged with a polyhistidine (His6) extension.
This facilitates rapid purification in quantities suitable for (time-resolved)
spectroscopy studies for which a relatively high concentration of
protein is required.

Here, crystal structures of the viral collagen
prolyl hydroxylase
from P. bursaria Chlorella Virus-1 (PBCV-1) in both
manganese-bound and zinc- and 2-OG-bound conformations are reported.
Crystallographic determination of co-complexes with a peptide substrate
was not possible despite considerable effort, so molecular dynamics
simulations were used to simulate the mode of binding of a proline-rich
peptide substrate. Stopped-flow spectroscopy was used to monitor the
formation and/or decay of a metal–ligand charge-transfer (MLCT)
complex and formation of a hydroxylated product, providing information
about the kinetics of the reaction cycle and information about the
spectroscopic properties of chemical reaction intermediates (Figure 1).

Experimental
Procedures
Protein Expression and Purification
A gene encoding
an N-terminally truncated variant of prolyl hydroxylase from P. bursaria Chlorella Virus-1 (PBCV-1) (residues 36–242)
(NCBI GI number 9631654) was synthesized with codon optimization for Escherichia coli and cloned into pET-28a with an N-terminal
His6 tag using the NdeI/XhoI sites. The variant was produced
to remove a predicted N-terminal transmembrane helix. The truncated
protein (hereafter termed vCPH) was produced in E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and purified using a three-step
process. The initial nickel affinity chromatography step used a 5
mL HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare) column with a protocol involving a wash
step in 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, and 20 mM imidazole
(pH 7.4) followed by an elution gradient from 50 to 250 mM imidazole.
After elution, vCPH was exhaustively dialyzed in 20 mM Tris (pH 8)
before being loaded onto a ResourceQ (GE Healthcare) anionic exchange
column. An elution gradient was applied to the column with the NaCl
concentration increasing from 0 to 375 mM over 20 column volumes.
After elution, vCPH was concentrated and diluted into 0.2 M EDTA and
12 mM ammonium acetate to remove metal impurities and left overnight
at 4 °C. vCPH was then further concentrated before being loaded
onto a HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column,
equilibrated with 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5).

Peptide Synthesis
Peptides were synthesized as C-terminal
amides as described previously21 using
a CS Bio CS336 multichannel solid phase peptide synthesizer with Fmoc-protected
amino acids, PL-AMS resin (Polymer Laboratories) with Rink amide linker
and DIC/HOBT coupling, deprotected (88:5:5:2 CF3CO2H:phenol:H2O:triisopropylsilane),
and purified by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography
using a Vydac 218TP C18 10-15u column (Grace Davison Discovery Sciences).
Fmoc-trans-4-hydroxyproline (Fmoc-Hyp) was from Bachem
UK.

Substrate Hydroxylation Assay
Hydroxylase activity
was measured by mass spectrometry. Reactions were performed in a total
volume of 50 μL containing 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), with
4 mM ascorbate, 300 mM 2-OG, a 50 μM Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O stock solution
(prepared freshly in 200 μM HCl to prevent oxidation), 4 μM
enzyme, and 100 μM substrate. Controls used buffer instead of
enzyme; all assay tubes were shaken in an incubator at 37 °C
for the appropriate amount of time and then quenched with an equal
volume of methanol (50 μL).

Mass spectrometry measurements
were performed after spotting 2 μL of a sample mixture {50%
peptide solution and 50% CHCA matrix [recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic
acid (Laser Bio Laboratories)]} onto a MALDI 96-well sample plate.
Peptide hydroxylation was measured in positive ion mode, with a laser
voltage of 12000 and a reflectron voltage of 5200. Spectra were analyzed
using MassLynx version 4.0, and the percentage peptide hydroxylation
was calculated using eq 1: 1  where IOH and Inon-OH correspond to peak intensities
of hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated peptides, respectively.22

Crystallization
vCPH was concentrated
to 30 mg/mL in
100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) before being supplemented with 1.1 mM MnCl2. Crystals of vCPH were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion
and incubated at 4 °C and arose from a reservoir solution containing
0.1 M imidazole, a MES monohydrate (acid) buffer system, 0.1 M amino
acids [0.2 M sodium l-glutamate, 0.2 M alanine (racemic),
0.2 M glycine, 0.2 M lysine HCl (racemic), and 0.2 M serine (racemic)],
and 30% PEGMME 550 PEG 20K (pH 6.5) [Morpheus HT96 condition H1, Molecular
Dimensions]. The complexed 2-OG structure was obtained by soaking
crystals in mother liquor supplemented with 250 mM ZnSO4 and 100 mM 2-OG for 16 h. All crystals were subsequently cryofrozen
by being plunged into liquid nitrogen.

Data Collection and Phase
Determination
X-ray diffraction
data were collected from single cryocooled crystals at Diamond Light
Source and subsequently integrated and scaled using XDS.23

Model Building and Refinement
All
structures were determined
by molecular replacement in Phaser24 using
a search model derived from a related prolyl hydroxylase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [Cr-P4H; Protein Data Bank (PDB)
entry 2JIG].
Xtriage25 was used to analyze the data
sets and indicated significant twinning was present in both the Mn(II)
and 2-OG data. Twinning was detected using Britton analyses, an H-test,
and the maximum likelihood methodology as implemented in Xtriage.
A pseudomerohedral twin operator (h, −k, −l) was found and used to automatically
account for the twinning during subsequent refinement. The resulting
models were completed through iterative rounds of rebuilding in COOT26 and refinement in Phenix.25 Structure validation with MOLPROBITY27 and PDB_REDO28 was integrated
as part of the iterative rebuild and refinement procedure.

Molecular
Modeling of a Peptide-Bound Structure
In
the absence of a peptide-bound crystal structure, a model was generated
by first superimposing the structure of the 2-OG-bound vCPH with that
of Cr-P4H in complex with a peptide (PDB entry 3GZE) using Secondary
Structure Matching (SSM) in Coot.29 The
peptide substrate from superimposed model 3GZE was then substituted for the sequence
of the peptide substrate of vCPH, PKPAPK, and merged into the PDB
file of the vCPH 2-OG structure (vCPH-2OG-Pep). The resultant model
was subsequently superimposed onto the vCPH·Mn(II) structure
and the peptide backbone real space refined into the electron density
observed in this structure from a symmetry-related monomer’s
N-terminal His tail that was ordered within the peptide binding site
(Figure 3A). The side
chain orientations were used to inform initial rotamer choices of
the mutated peptide; however, these were not constrained in the molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. The resulting model was then exported to
the Rosetta FlexPepDock web server30 and
used as the starting model for molecular dynamics and energy minimization.
The peptide altered its position to a conformation similar to that
of the peptide bound in the 3GZE structure of Cr-P4H. MD simulations were used to explore
the conformation of the βII−βIII loop in the absence
and presence of the peptide substrate (with 2-OG and Mn bound in both
cases). In the Mn(II)-bound structure, the βII−βIII
loop adopts a folded back conformation, similar to that of Cr-P4H
in the absence of ligand.31 The α1−β2
loop was first modeled using SWISS-MODEL,32,33 and MD simulations were then conducted using Gromacs34,35 version 4.6.1 with the Gromos 53a6 force field.36 To ensure maximal sampling, an initial 10 ns of simulation
at 300 K was followed by periodic annealing with the temperature alternating
between 300 and 350 K every 1 ns, with heating and cooling over a
10 ps window for a total of 50 ns. This method did not require constraints
on the protein or peptide to avoid unfolding during the high-temperature
dynamics, but for the peptide-bound protein, a center-of-mass distance
restraint of 10 kJ mol–1 Å–2 was applied between the peptide and the protein to prevent unbinding.

Dissociation Constant Determination
The dissociation
constant (Kd) of the 2-OG–vCPH
complex was determined by measuring absorbance changes associated
with the MLCT complex after titration of 2-OG into a solution of vCPH·Fe(II)
using a Cary 50Bio UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent technologies).
After addition of a small volume of a 2-OG solution, spectra were
normalized to account for the addition of small volumes of ligand
and the absorbance was set to zero at 700 nm. The absorbance values
at 520 nm were plotted against ligand concentration, and the data
were then fitted to determine the Kd for
the enzyme–2-OG complex (eq 2): 2  where Y is the relative change
in fluorescence, Y0 is fluorescence in
the absence of ligand, dY is the change in Y, [E] is the enzyme concentration, [L] is the ligand concentration,
and Kd is the vCPH–2-OG complex
dissociation constant.

The dissociation constants for peptide–vCPH
complexes were determined by tryptophan fluorescence quenching using
a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent technologies).
The crystal structure shows Trp237 present in the peptide and 2-OG
binding site, indicating binding of ligands would affect tryptophan
fluorescence. For tryptophan fluorescence experiments, samples were
excited at 295 nm and the integrals of the area under the emission
spectra (peak at ≈350 nm) were first measured and adjusted
to account for volume changes upon the addition of peptide. The initial
fluorescence intensity was adjusted to 1, and fluorescence intensities
with ligand bound were calculated relative to the initial fluorescence
and described as a factor of 1. The relative fluorescence was then
plotted against ligand concentration and fitted to eq 2 to calculate the dissociation constant.

Transient State Kinetics
Transient state kinetic studies
of the reaction cycle were investigated using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer
(TgK Scientific). The stopped-flow equipment used a 75 W xenon Arc
lamp and a photomultiplier tube as the absorbance and fluorescence
detectors. Prior to measurement of absorbance changes, a baseline
for protein absorbance of protein and buffer was taken. For fluorescence
measurements, the initial fluorescence intensity was set to 100%,
and subsequent fluorescence measurements were relative to this intensity.
Changes in fluorescence emission were measured as a percentage of
signal change.

Single-wavelength stopped-flow data were analyzed
using OriginPro software (version 8.5) to give an observed rate constant
for the reaction. The data were fitted to an exponential decay function: 3  where A*i is the amplitude, t is the time, ki is the observed rate constant
of the ith exponential component, y is the change in absorbance or fluorescence, and b is the offset value to take into account the non-zero baseline.
Transients were fitted from the dead time of the instrument (approximately
2 ms), and each transient was independently fitted to the moving average
(nine consecutive points were averaged) of the change in absorbance
or fluorescence. Typically, three to five transients were averaged
to give the data shown.

The dependence of the observed rate
constants on the concentration
of ligand was used to gain more information about the spectral features
being measured. When the kobs was plotted
against ligand/substrate concentration and showed a linear relationship,
the data were fitted to the following equation for second-order kinetics: 4  where kobs is
the observed rate constant, kon is the
on-rate constant, [L] is the ligand or substrate concentration, and koff is the off-rate constant.

Rapid Quench
Mass Spectrometry Experiments
Rapid quench-flow
experiments were used to measure levels of cosubstrate and product
on a millisecond time scale during a reaction. A rapid quench-flow
apparatus (RQF-63, TgK Scientific) was used in an anaerobic glovebox
(Belle Technologies). Samples were quenched after the reaction solution
had been mixed with 1% CF3CO2H (TFA) and analyzed
using MALDI-TOF-MS (peptide hydroxylation) or LC–MS (succinate
formation).10,18 For LC–MS, chromatographic
separation was performed at 50 °C using a Waters ACQUITY BEH
Amide 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm column on a Waters ACQUITYTM
ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The following
eluents were used: mobile phase A, 10% H2O, 90% (v/v) acetonitrile,
and 10 mM ammonium formate; mobile phase B, 50% H2O, 50%
(v/v) acetonitrile, and 10 mM ammonium formate. The elution gradient
was 0 to 5.0 min linear from 10 to 50% B and 5.0 to 7.0 min at 10%
B for re-equilibration of the column. A constant flow rate of 0.4
mL/min was used. Analytes were detected in negative ionization mode
using single-reaction monitoring (SRM) on a Quattro triple-quadruple
mass spectrometer (Waters) with a cone voltage of 15 V and a capillary
voltage of 3.0 kV. The desolvation temperature was set to 250 °C
and the source temperature to 120 °C. For MALDI-MS, peptide hydroxylation
was measured as described above.

Results
Description
of Mn(II)-Bound vCPH and vCPH in Complex with 2-OG
Two structures
of vCPH were obtained, one in complex with Mn(II)
and another in complex with Zn(II) and a 2-OG molecule (Table 1). Mn(II) and Zn(II) were used
in crystal screens, rather than Fe(II), to make an inactive enzyme
complex. The Mn(II)-bound structure contains two molecules per asymmetric
unit, and these superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation (rmsd)
of 0.34 Å. Several electron density features remain within the
active site of the Mn(II)-complexed structure; these proved to be
insufficient to accurately model and have been highlighted as UNK
in the final structure. The metal ions were modeled on the basis of
the known metals present during protein production and crystallogenesis
and validated using the CheckMyMetal (CMM) server.37 The crystal packing of the vCPH·Mn(II) structure shows
a symmetry-related molecule from a neighboring monomer within the
crystal lattice has inserted a portion of its N-terminus and His tag
linker into the peptide binding site of each monomer.

The vCPH·Mn(II) structure is comprised of a total
of 185 of
a possible 206 residues spanning residues 34–78 and 100–242
(numbering is maintained from the full length gene; residues 34 and
35 are the start of the His tag linker) (Figure 2A). The C-terminal Lys242 is disordered in
chain A. The monomeric fold is comprised of two β-sheets and
two α-helices (Figure 2A). Starting at the N-terminus, the β1 strand extends
the major sheet of the DSBH (βI, VIII, III, and VI) by hydrogen
bonding to βVI. This is followed by α1, which packs across
the major β-sheet, and a disordered loop region, 21 residues
long. After this, β2 extends the major β-sheet by hydrogen
bonding to βI, followed by α2, which packs across the
entire major β-sheet (Figure 2A). The region following the βI strand (Tyr148–Asp157)
is present as a β-strand in other members of this enzyme family.
However, in the Mn-bound vCPH structure, this region does not appear
to maintain regular hydrogen bonding associated with β-sheets.
Despite this, this region is still labeled βII to conserve the
nomenclature of this highly conserved structural motif. The βVII
strand also appears not to form uniform antiparallel β-sheet
hydrogen bonds with the adjacent βIV strand. Two pairs of cysteine
residues form disulfide bonds in vCPH. One pair, Cys47 and Cys129,
links a region N-terminal to β1 to the loop between α2
and βI (Figure 2A). It is possible that this linkage may stabilize the α2−βI
loop and allow the α2 helix to pack along the major β-sheet.
The second pair consists of Cys158 and Cys162, which are part of a
βII−βIII loop region near the active site.

a viral collagen prolyl hydroxylase (vCPH). (A) Overall
topology of the Mn-bound vCPH (PDB entry 5C5U). β-Strands (labeled I–VIII)
of the DSBH motif are colored red, additional β-strands gray,
and α-helices and loop regions blue. The Mn(II) ion is shown
as a dark green sphere. A peptide found in a neighboring molecule
in the crystal lattice is colored green. A disordered loop region
is shown as a dashed line. (B) Changes in the βII loop upon
binding of 2-OG to vCPH. Residues from the Mn-bound structure are
colored red, and residues from the 2-OG-bound structure (PDB entry 5C5T) are colored cyan.
The metal binding residues are colored yellow; the Zn(II) ion is shown
as a magenta sphere, and the 2-OG molecule is colored green. The inset
shows the interactions of Tyr149 with residues in the 2-OG-bound structure.
(C) Position of 2-OG in the active site of vCPH. Residues from the
Mn-bound structure are colored red. Residues from the 2-OG-bound structure
are colored cyan, and hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines. The
Zn(II) ion is shown as a magenta sphere, and waters are shown as blue
spheres (Mn-bound structure only). 2-OG is colored green along with
the 2Fo – Fc density, contoured at the 2σ level. Tyr149 from the
2-OG-bound structure has been omitted for the sake of clarity.

The overall topology of the 2-OG-bound
structure is similar to
that of the Mn-bound structure. However, significant changes in the
βII strand active site residues are observed upon 2-OG binding
(Figure 2B) (βII
supports two of the three metal binding residues). In the Mn-bound
structure, Tyr149 is flipped out away from the active site, but when
2-OG binds to vCPH, Tyr149 is flipped into the active site such that
it is positioned to hydrogen bond to a water molecule that hydrogen
bonds to the C-1 carboxylate moiety of 2-OG. Tyr148 and Tyr150 also
appear in a different orientation in the 2-OG-bound structure compared
to that in the Mn-bound structure. These changes allow the βII
and βVII strands to form regular hydrogen bonds to their adjacent
β-strands. They also mean certain residues are more ordered
in the 2-OG-bound structure as 16 residues of the α1−β2
loop region are disordered (Lys78–Asp93) in the 2-OG-bound
structure, compared to the 21 residues (Ser79–Ser99) in the
Mn-bound structure. The change in orientation of the Tyr149 side chain
allows interactions with both His152 and Arg97 (Figure 2B, inset); Arg97 in the Mn(II) structure,
however, forms part of the disordered region.

the rmsd for the periodic annealing simulations (cyan for peptide-free,
orange for peptide-bound) is shown as well as that for 300 K simulations
(gray).

The metals bound in the active
sites of our structures are bound
by the conserved iron-coordinating residues His152, Asp154, and His221.12 The proximal His152 and Asp154 residues originate
from the βII strand, and the distal His221 originates from the
βVII strand (Figure 2A). Three water molecules are also coordinated to the Mn(II)
ion and occupy places trans to both the equatorial
and axial histidines (His152 and His221, respectively) and trans to Asp154 (Figure 2C). In the 2-OG-bound structure, the 2-OG molecule
is bound to the Zn(II) ion in a bidentate manner where one oxygen
of the C-1 carboxylate is ligated trans to the axial
His221 and the C-2 carbonyl is trans to Asp154. The
position trans to His152, which contained a water
molecule in the Mn-bound structure, is now vacant when 2-OG is bound.
It is likely that this position is the site of oxygen binding according
to the consensus mechanism (Figure 1). This would mean that the active site might be required
to undergo a rearrangement to position the reactive oxygen adjacent
to the oxidized bond of the substrate, as observed for other prolyl
hydroxylases.38 Several hydrogen bonds,
electrostatic contacts, and hydrophobic interactions are made with
the 2-OG molecule within the 2-OG binding pocket. These include the
conserved basic Lys231 residue (Figure 2C).

Peptide Substrate Interactions with vCPH
In the absence
of a peptide-bound crystal structure, a model of vCPH was generated
with peptide PKPAPK bound in the active site (see Experimental Procedures). This is a shorter sequence of (PAPK)n, a substrate described by Hoffart et al.20 This was used as the starting model for molecular
dynamics and energy minimization studies (Figure 3). PKPAPK adopts
a PPII helical structure in the model and binds vCPH across the entrance
to the active site between the βII−βIII loop and
the loop region between α1 and β2 (Figure 3B). This is a conformation similar to that
of the peptide bound in the structure of Cr-P4H.39 The peptide predominantly interacts with vCPH via hydrophobic
residues from the β2 and βII strands (Figure 3B). Hydrogen bonds are formed
from Tyr149 to the main chain atoms of Pro1, and Arg167 forms hydrogen
bonds to the main chain atoms of Ala4 and Pro3. Pro3 of the peptide
is pointed toward the Zn(II) ion in the active site, placing the C4
atom in the proximity of the metal ion, indicating that the peptide
is positioned optimally for hydroxylation (Figure 3B).

The conformations of the two loops
near the peptide binding site were simulated using MD calculations
after the disordered α1−β2 loop was modeled using
SWISS-MODEL. The simulations showed that in the absence of peptide
the βII−βIII loop adopted a more open conformation
(Figure 3C), whereas
with peptide bound, this loop quickly adopts a conformation closed
around the peptide. The fact that the loop in the peptide-bound protein
remains in this closed conformation during the periodic annealing
reveals that this is a metastable state. On the other hand, as can
be seen from the rmsd (Figure 3D,E) and the traces following the loop motion (Figure 3C), the βII−βIII
loop is likely to be more disordered without the peptide bound.

Rapid Quench-Flow Experiments Observing Product Formation
The PBCV-1 genome contains many predicted proteins with proline-rich
repeat sequences, including proteins with (PAPK)n repeats in which n is &gt;20.40 Recombinant vCPH is able to hydroxylate various
proline-rich
peptide sequences.20 Different peptide
sequences were assayed to determine how the sequence affects the rate
of product formation. These were variants of the (PAPK)n sequence determined to be preferable substrates
for vCPH by Eriksson et al.20 (Figure 4). Initially, we
analyzed (PAPK)n, where n = 2 and 5, by MALDI mass spectrometry. We found that with n = 2, two hydroxylations were observed (a mass shift from
806.7 to 838.7 Da), whereas for n = 5, up to eight
hydroxylations were observed (a mass shift from 1984.1 to 2111.5 Da).
Under the same conditions, (PAPP)5 underwent up to four
hydroxylations (a mass shift from 1851.6 to 1915.2 Da), whereas (PEPV)5 was not hydroxylated (Figure 4). Eriksson et al.20 previously
showed that only “internal” prolines (i.e., not those
at the N- and C-terminal positions) were being hydroxylated. This
is likely the case for the (PAPK)n and
(PAPP)5 substrates. However, as (PEPV)5 was
not hydroxylated, this suggests specificity for only certain proline-rich
peptides.

show the change in mass of peptides after they were incubated with
vCPH. The top plots show the masses of the peptides after overnight
incubations, and the bottom plots show the initial masses of the peptides.
The number of oxygen molecules added to each peptide is indicated.
Assay conditions: 4 μM vCPH, 160 μM ascorbate, 15 mM 2-OG,
1 μM FeSO4, and 100 μM peptide in 50 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.5). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C and
reactions quenched with methanol.

Other potential substrates were then tested with vCPH, with
a view
of identifying a good substrate undergoing only a single hydroxylation
suitable for kinetic analyses. One of the hydroxylation sites in (PAPK)2 was blocked by introduction of a trans-4-hydroxyproline
residue (Hyp) to give PAPKHypAPK; this peptide was found to undergo
only a single hydroxylation (a mass shift from 822.8 to 838.8 Da).
Subsequent studies employed longer peptides to allow adequate binding,
but also undergoing a single hydroxylation as shown by mass spectrometry.
These were (GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2 and (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2 (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Product formation of the reaction of vCPH with
three peptide substrates.
Plots of the reaction of vCPH in complex with Fe(II), 2-OG, and peptide
with oxygen are shown. Three peptide substrates were assayed and the
samples chemically quenched with 1% TFA at different time points.
Quenched samples were analyzed to determine the percentage of peptide
hydroxylation using eq 1 (A) and levels of succinate (B) during the reaction. The data were
fitted to a single-exponential function shown as a red line eq 3. Final conditions: 800
μM vCPH, 800 μM FeSO4, 1 mM 2-OG, and 1 mM
peptide in 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) under anaerobic conditions at 5 °C,
reacted with O2-saturated buffer.

The dissociation constants of the vCPH–peptide complexes
were determined by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence quenching upon
addition of peptide substrate to a solution of vCPH in complex with
Fe(II). The peptides studied in detail were all found to bind tightly
to vCPH as they had dissociation constants between 1.6 and 2.9 μM
(Table 2). This suggests
that only stretches of hydrophobic residues rather than prolines are
necessary as the glycine-rich sequence, (GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2, had a dissociation constant similar to those of proline-rich
sequences.

The rate of product formation
in the reaction catalyzed by vCPH
using three different peptides [(PAPK)3, (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2, and (GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2] was determined by rapid quench-flow experiments. Samples
were collected when the reaction of vCPH·Fe(II)·2-OG with
peptide and oxygen was chemically quenched with 1% trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) at various time points. Hydroxylated peptide formed was
quantified by MALDI-TOF MS and succinate generated by LC–MS
(Figure 5). The rate
constants of peptide hydroxylation and succinate formation are listed
in Table 2. Rate constants
for the (PAPK)3 peptide were not measured because of the
multiple hydroxylation sites on the peptide, but rates were obtained
for succinate formation.

The rate constant for hydroxylation
of (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2 was determined
to be faster than that for the (GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2 peptide (Figure 5A), suggesting that (hydroxylated) proline-rich
peptides are preferable to glycine-rich peptides as vCPH substrates.
The rate of peptide hydroxylation and the rate of succinate formation
are similar for both peptides (GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2 and (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2 (Table 2). This is consistent
with the consensus mechanism, which implies that hydroxylation is
coupled to 2-OG decarboxylation (Figure 1).

Characterization of the MLCT Complex in vCPH
The dissociation
constant for the vCPH–2OG complex in the presence of Fe(II)
was determined by measuring absorbance changes at 520 nm. These absorbance
changes are associated with the MLCT complex (ε520 = 250 M–1 cm–19). A broad spectral feature was observed over 400–700
nm after 2-OG was added to vCPH with an absorbance maximum at approximately
520 nm (Figure 6A).
The values at 520 nm were plotted against 2-OG concentration and fitted
to eq 2 to determine
a Kd for the 2-OG–vCPH complex
(746 ± 128 μM). This value differs from that reported by
Hoffart et al. (27 ± 6 μM). However, the agreement of our
value with the value determined by tryptophan fluorescence (681 ±
128 μM) (Table 3) indicates a weaker binding mode may be at play.

fitted to an exponential equation (eq 3). The top right-hand plot shows the observed rate
constants of tryptophan quenching for the first faster phase vs 2-OG
concentration, and the bottom plot shows their respective amplitudes.
Final conditions: 5 μM vCPH, 20 μM FeSO4 mixed
with varying concentrations of 2-OG in a 50 mM Tris, 0.5 mM NaCl buffer
(pH 7.6) under anaerobic conditions at 10 °C. Samples were excited
at 295 nm, and fluorescence at 350 nm was measured.

The transient state kinetics of MLCT complex formation
were investigated
by stopped-flow spectroscopy. Absorbance changes at 520 nm were measured
after vCPH·Fe(II) was mixed with varying concentrations of 2-OG
(Figure 6B). A single-
or double-exponential reaction trace was observed (Figure 6B). Figure 6B shows the observed rate constants calculated
from the single-wavelength traces of the first (faster) phase plotted
against 2-OG concentration. The data show a linear relationship between
2-OG concentration and the observed rate constant, confirming that
this first phase is a second-order process. The data were fitted to
a linear equation (eq 4) to calculate the kon and koff values, which were 17.8 ± 5.0 mM–1 s–1 and 65.8 ± 30.9 s–1, respectively (Table 3). The rates of the slower phase were found to be independent of
2-OG concentration and were in the range of 2–20 s–1 (data not shown). Experimental difficulties associated with absorption
measurements {poor signal-to-noise ratio due to protein precipitation
of high concentrations of the vCPH·Fe(II)·2OG [or vCPH·Fe(II)]
complex, combined with a low extinction coefficient} meant absorbance
amplitude values could not be determined and multiple measurements
per 2-OG concentration were not possible, resulting in the lack of
error bars in Figure 6B. However, these difficulties were not experienced in the rapid
quench experiments, potentially because of the presence of substrate,
allowing higher protein concentrations to be used. As an alternative
method, changes in tryptophan fluorescence were measured to determine
whether they report on 2-OG binding. A single- or double-exponential
trace of fluorescence quenching was observed when the vCPH·Fe(II)
complex was mixed with 2-OG (Figure 6C). The first exponential rate constants had a linear
dependence on 2-OG concentration, similar to absorbance measurements.
The kon and koff rates of this first exponential phase (19.8 ± 0.9 mM–1 s–1 and 31.6 ± 1.4 s–1,
respectively) were comparable to those determined by absorbance measurements
(Table 3), indicating
that tryptophan quenching also reports on 2-OG binding. Also, the
dissociation constant measured by tryptophan quenching (680 ±
130 μM) (Table 3) was comparable to the value presented in Figure 6A. The amplitudes of the stopped-flow transients
also did not appear to saturate until ≈2 mM 2-OG (Figure 6C), which would indicate
incomplete binding at lower concentrations, consistent with 2-OG binding
weakly to vCPH. Despite difficulties in measuring absorbance changes
associated with the MLCT complex, these data suggest a multiple-step
mechanism for 2-OG binding.

Discussion
Comparison
between the Structure of vCPH and Those of Structural
Homologues
The crystal structure of a viral collagen prolyl
hydroxylase has been determined for the first time (Figure 2). vCPH contains many of the
structural features conserved in other Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent
dioxygenases, including the DSBH motif and iron binding residues12 (Figure 2A). To date, the crystal structures of five prolyl-4-hydroxylases,
including vCPH, have been determined. These are human HIF prolyl hydroxylase
2 (PHD2),41C. reinhardtii prolyl hydroxylase (Cr-P4H),31 a prolyl
hydroxylase from Bacillus anthracis (anthrax P4H),42 and a Pseudomonas aeruginosa prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein (PPHD).43 The structure of a human ribosomal prolyl-3-hydroxylase,
OGFOD1 (Tpa1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), has also
been reported, but this is more distantly related to the prolyl-4-hydroxylases.44,45 vCPH superimposes well with the prolyl-4-hydroxylase proteins, and
the DSBH fold, α1, β1, β2, and α2 of vCPH
are in positions similar to those of the topologically similar regions
in these three enzymes (Figure 7A). These other prolyl hydroxylases often have N-terminal
extensions and differences in loops from the core DSBH motif.

Sequences were aligned by their secondary structures, using the Promal3D
server. The secondary structure of vCPH is labeled above the sequence.
β-Sheets are shown as red arrows and α-helices as blue
squares. Residues involved in iron, 2-OG, and peptide binding are
labeled as triangles, circles, and squares, respectively. Underlined
residues in the βII−βIII loop indicate the conserved
D/E-X-X-N/D motif. Key: α-helix, h; β-strand, e; conserved

Unique to vCPH, in 2-OG oxygenase
structures determined to date,
is a disulfide bond formed between a region N-terminal to β1
and the α2−βI loop (Cys47 and Cys129) (Figure 2A). In Cr-P4H and
anthrax P4H, this N-terminal to β1 region is shorter and contains
an α-helix, and in PHD2, this is a longer loop that interacts
with the C-terminal helix of PHD2. It is possible that this disulfide
bond is present in vCPH to give stability to this region, which is
unnecessary in the shorter loop regions of Cr-P4H and anthrax P4H.
Stability of this equivalent region in PHD2 is provided by interactions
of the extended loop with the C-terminal helix. Another disulfide
bond is present in the βII−βIII loop (Cys158 and
Cys162). This bond should stabilize the loop region. In Cr-P4H, this
loop is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between Asp149 and Asn152, which
are conserved in other prolyl hydroxylases (Figure 7D).39 In anthrax
P4H, this region contains an α-helix and hydrogen bonds between
residues of the loop, which would stabilize the region.

Comparison
of the 2-OG Binding Site with Homologues
The 2-OG binding
site in vCPH is similar to that of other prolyl
C-4 hydroxylases. The majority of residues that form hydrogen bonds
to 2-OG in vCPH are conserved in Cr-P4H (Thr186, Lys231, Tyr143, Gln139,
and Tyr149 in vCPH) (Figure 7B,D). Exceptions include Asn235 in vCPH, which is Thr241 in
Cr-P4H. However, regardless of the residue in this position, it still
forms hydrogen bonds with the C1 carboxylate of 2-OG [2,4-pyridine-dicarboxylate
(PDCA) in Cr-P4H]. Gln130 in Cr-P4H is hydrogen bonded to the main
chain atoms of Ala153 in the βII−βIII loop, which
is folded over the active site, whereas the equivalent residue Gln139
in vCPH forms an interaction with 2-OG via a water molecule (Figure 7B). It is possible
that this hydrogen bond in vCPH will resemble the equivalent residue
in Cr-P4H if the topologically similar loop region in vCPH folds over
the active site. The active site of vCPH also shares many conserved
residues with PHD2 (Figure 7C). However, they have significantly different Kd values for the 2-OG–enzyme complex under comparable
conditions. The value calculated for vCPH was 746 ± 128 μM
(Table 3), which is
much higher than that of PHD2 (≤2 μM).18,46

Upon comparison of the structures of vCPH and PHD2, the structural
origin of the variation in the dissociation constant for the 2-OG–enzyme
is not clear. However, one difference is a different basic residue
coordinating C5 of 2-OG (Lys231 in vCPH, Arg383 in PHD2) (Figure 7C), and studies of
a PHD2 R383K variant have shown weaker binding of 2-OG to the PHD2–Fe(II)
complex.47 This may explain the weaker
binding of 2-OG in vCPH compared to that in the structurally similar
PHD2. The active site of PHD2 is proposed to be specifically tailored
for the tight binding of 2-OG and slow reactivity with oxygen.47 Further comparative studies of vCPH and PHD2
might shed light on why PHD2 is so slow to react with oxygen.

Tyr149 in the Mn-bound structure of vCPH is flipped out from the
active site (Figure 2B). When 2-OG is bound, this residue flips toward the active site
where it forms hydrogen bonds with 2-OG via a water molecule. The
adjacent Tyr150 residue also has a similar flipping movement. This
is similar to that observed for the equivalent residues in Cr-P4H.31 This movement has been suggested to modulate
loop movements upon substrate binding. Tyr150 in Mn-bound vCPH is
in the position where the α1−β2 loop would be expected
when the peptide substrate is bound. When this residue flips out,
upon 2-OG binding, it may allow the loop movement to occur and facilitate
peptide substrate binding. This tyrosine residue is conserved in other
prolyl hydroxylases (Figure 7D), and this structure shows this residue is a potential “conformational
switch” as also suggested by Koski and colleagues.39

2-OG is bound to the Zn (substituting
for Fe) with the 1-carboxylate trans to the distal
histidine (His221) and the 2-oxo group trans to the
aspartate residue (Asp154) (Figure 2C). This mode of binding is
observed in crystal structures of other family members, including
PHD2, carbapenem synthase (CarC),48 and
anthocyanidin synthase (ANS).49 The positioning
of 2-OG in this manner means that the unoccupied coordination site
on iron, where oxygen could bind, is oriented away from the peptide
substrate. Several suggestions of how the oxygen becomes oriented
toward the substrate during catalysis have been discussed.1,12,50 One of these possibilities includes
a rearrangement of the C-1 carboxylate of the 2-OG molecule. It has
been discussed that in Cr-P4H a change in position of the 2-OG molecule
to a position where oxygen binds trans to the axial
histidine would require the movement of the side chain of Tyr140.
It is possible that this might apply to vCPH as Tyr149 is in a position
topologically similar to that of Tyr140.

Significance of the Kinetics
of MLCT Complex Formation in vCPH
Aspects of the catalytic
cycle of vCPH were analyzed using stopped-flow
spectroscopy, including using a peptide that undergoes a single hydroxylation.
Specifically, absorbance changes at 520 nm upon mixing of vCPH with
2-OG report on 2-OG binding (Figure 6B). Absorbance data were difficult to obtain because
of enzyme precipitation at the required high enzyme concentrations
(&gt;200 μM) for observation of the relatively weak absorption
signals. Consequently, tryptophan fluorescence was used to measure
2-OG binding at a substantially reduced vCPH concentration (5 μM)
(Figure 6C). Tryptophan
fluorescence changes mirrored data obtained by absorbance measurements
suggesting that both signals observed in stopped-flow studies report
on 2-OG binding (i.e., MLCT complex formation) (Table 3). This is further supported by the presence
of Trp237 in the 2-OG binding pocket, which would be affected by ligand
binding (Figure 2C).
A two-step binding mechanism in which a faster transient developed
at the higher concentrations of 2-OG assayed was identified (Figure 6B,C). The faster
kinetic phase was determined to have second-order kinetics (kon and koff values
17.8 ± 5.0 mM–1 s–1 and 65.8
± 30.9 s–1, respectively, for absorbance changes
and 19.8 ± 0.9 mM–1 s–1 and
31.6 ± 1.4 s–1, respectively, for tryptophan
fluorescence measurements). However, the slower phase obeyed first-order
kinetics as the observed rate constants were independent of 2-OG concentration.
These data are consistent with a model in which 2-OG binds vCPH initially
in a 2-OG concentration-dependent manner. A slower first-order active
site rearrangement occurs after this initial binding phase (Scheme 1), where k1 and k2 describe
the kon and koff values, respectively.

Scheme 1 Rate constant k3 can be described by
the observed rate constants measured from the second (slower) phase
that was independent of 2-OG concentration. A similar experiment conducted
on TauD determined that binding of 2-OG to the enzyme·Fe(II)
complex was also multiphasic.51 Price et
al. showed evidence that this complex kinetic scheme arises from multiple
conformational states of the enzyme.51 Other
studies of Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent dioxygenases have shown that
the DSBH core is more conformationally flexible, in particular in
the apo state (i.e., without 2OG or metal) of DNA demethylase AlkB52,53 and PHD2.53,54 It seems likely that similar
conformational flexibility is a feature of the multistep mechanism
for binding of 2-OG to vCPH.

Mode of Peptide Binding in vCPH
Loop regions close
to the active site are important in substrate binding in other prolyl-4-hydroxylases.38,39 Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that peptide binding
facilitates formation of a “closed” conformation of
vCPH (Figure 3). This
closed conformation has also been observed in Cr-P4H and PHD2. However,
the βII−βIII loop in PHD2 is shorter than the equivalent
in vCPH and does not directly participate in substrate binding at
the active site.

The βII−βIII loop contains
a conserved D/E-X-X-N/D motif present in other collagen prolyl hydroxylases39 (Figure 7D), which has been shown to maintain the structure of the
loop region via a hydrogen bonding network.39 This motif is also present in vCPH (Figure 7D), suggesting a similar role for these residues.
However, these simulations do not show this hydrogen bonding network
is present. Another conserved sequence of residues, the D/N-X-X-S/T-G
motif, present in the equivalent α1−β2 loop region
in various other collagen prolyl hydroxylases is not present in vCPH
(Figure 7D).39 This sequence was shown to be important in peptide
binding in Cr-P4H, and its absence in vCPH suggests the mode of peptide
binding differs from those of other collagen prolyl hydroxylases.

Hydrophobic residues surrounding the hydroxylated proline residue
in the Cr-P4H peptide-bound structure are conserved in vCPH (Figure 7D). These residues
are Val81 (Val79 in Cr-P4H) and Gly82 (Val80 in Cr-P4H), which may
serve the same function in vCPH. The peptide binding groove is also
similar to that of Cr-P4H, as most residues in vCPH are conserved
in Cr-P4H apart from Asp157 in vCPH, which is Gly128 in Cr-P4H, and
Arg239, which is His245 in Cr-P4H (Figure 7D).39 This indicates
that the prolyl hydroxylases may have a conserved binding groove that
is able to accommodate proline-rich peptides via hydrophobic interactions.

Rapid quench mass spectrometry indicates that, of the peptides
tested, (GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2 was found to have
a rate of hydroxylation lower than that of (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2. This suggests a preference for proline residues in the sequences
rather than glycine residues. However, significant differences in
the dissociation constants of these peptides are not observed. Longer
peptides have been shown to be better substrates with lower Km and higher Vmax values.20 As there are likely several
hydrophobic interactions with the peptide and the peptide binding
groove, it is likely that longer peptides form additional hydrophobic
interactions leading to tighter binding. Rate constants for peptide
hydroxylation are similar to those for succinate formation for peptides
(GAGK)2PAGK(GAGK)2 and (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2. This agrees with the proposed mechanism
(Figure 1) for the
vCPH reaction cycle, in which these two processes are tightly coupled,
and the fact that in the case of vCPH there is minimal accumulation
of intermediate species between succinate formation and peptide hydroxylation.1,9,10 The rates of substrate hydroxylation
and succinate formation for vCPH are much faster than those of its
homologue, PHD218 [approximately 43- and
65-fold increases, respectively for (HypAHypK)2PAHypK(HypAHypK)2 in vCPH]. The rearrangement of the 2-OG molecule during catalysis
and a metal-coordinated water molecule stabilized by hydrogen bonding
with the metal binding Asp residue have both been proposed as factors
contributing to the slow reaction of PHD2 with oxygen.18,47,55 Relatively fast activation by
oxygen in vCPH may be caused by differences in the structure. Asp315
of PHD2 interacts with both the active site Fe(II) and a Fe(II)-coordinated
water molecule.47 This water is strongly
ligated in PHD2, and a D315E variant with a weaker interaction with
this water molecule, showed more rapid kinetics with respect to oxygen,
possibly as a result of more facile H2O release to allow
oxygen binding. Whether such a strongly ligated water molecule is
present in vCPH is not certain at present, but the crystal structure
reveals no such water molecule present in the Zn(II)- and 2-OG-bound
structure. The lack of a strongly bound water molecule in a Zn(II)-bound
vCPH could be another potential factor responsible for the faster
peptide hydroxylation. It is, however, unclear whether this is the
case in a Fe(II)-bound structure. Further studies of vCPH could elucidate
why the activation of oxygen in PHD2 is slow relative to other prolyl
hydroxylases.

Concluding Remarks
The crystal structure
of vCPH and
analysis of key aspects of the enzyme reaction cycle add to the growing
body of structural understanding of the Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent
prolyl hydroxylases. The study reveals that vCPH is an excellent and
accessible model for mechanistic analysis of the growing family of
prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, and more broadly the Fe(II)- and 2-OG-dependent
dioxygenase superfamily of enzymes.
