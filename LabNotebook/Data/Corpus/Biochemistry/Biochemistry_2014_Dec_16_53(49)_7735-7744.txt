OxlT, the oxalate/formate exchanger
of Oxalobacter
formigenes, is a member of the major facilitator superfamily
of transporters. In the present work, substrate (oxalate) was found
to enhance the reactivity of the cysteine mutant S336C on the cytoplasmic
end of helix 11 to methanethiosulfonate ethyl carboxylate. In addition,
S336C is found to spontaneously cross-link to S143C in TM5 in either
native or reconstituted membranes under conditions that support transport.
Continuous wave EPR measurements are consistent with this result and
indicate that positions 143 and 336 are in close proximity in the
presence of substrate. These two residues are localized within helix
interacting GxxxG-like motifs (G140LASG144 and
S336DIFG340) at the cytoplasmic poles of TM5
and TM11. Pulse EPR measurements were used to determine distances
and distance distributions across the cytoplasmic or periplasmic ends
of OxlT and were compared with the predictions of an inside-open homology
model. The data indicate that a significant population of transporter
is in an outside-open configuration in the presence of substrate;
however, each end of the transporter exhibits significant conformational
heterogeneity, where both inside-open and outside-open configurations
are present. These data indicate that TM5 and TM11, which form part
of the transport pathway, transiently close during transport and that
there is a conformational equilibrium between inside-open and outside-open
states of OxlT in the presence of substrate.

The anaerobic
Gram-negative
bacterium Oxalobacter formigenes is
an important component of the human microbiome that is responsible
for degradation of oxalate in the large intestine.1 In the bacterial inner membrane of O. formigenes, OxlT functions as an oxalate-formate exchanger,2 where the high activity of this transporter may play a
role as an alternate proton pump.3 OxlT
is also a member of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of secondary
transporters,4 which move diverse substrates
such as sugars, ions, amino acids, and neurotransmitters. MFS transporters
have a common fold with both an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain
of typically six transmembrane helixes (TMs) connected by a central
cytoplasmic loop. At the cytoplasmic end of TM2, and frequently at
the symmetry-related position in TM8, signature amino acid sequences,
Gxxx[D/E][R/K], are found.4 This is consistent
with the hypothesis that members of this family arose after a primordial
gene duplication and fusion event to generate the observed 2-fold
symmetry axis between the N- and C-terminal domains.5−17 The underlying similarity in structure implies that members of the
MFS function by a common molecular transport mechanism.

Significant
progress has been made in determining the three-dimensional
structures of selected MFS members;5−21 however, there is presently limited information on the conformational
states and molecular motions that provide the basis for transport.
The available crystal structures suggest that the relative positions
of helices in the N- and C-terminal domains may change in different
states of the transporter, and understanding these states and transitions
will be critical to determining mechanisms that drive transport in
MFS proteins.22

At the present time,
there are no high-resolution structures for
OxlT; however, there is an experimentally tested GlpT-based homology
model of OxlT, which is shown in Figure 1.23 In the OxlT homology model, the transport pathway
is open to the cytoplasm, similar to structures for LacY, GlpT, NarK,
GLUT1, PiPT, GlcPSe, and PepT(St).6,7,11,13,15,17,19 In this structure, helices 5 and 11 line the substrate permeation
pathway in OxlT,5,23−25 and there is
experimental evidence for substrate-dependent conformational changes
in TM5 of OxlT at S143C.24 This position
lies within a GxxxG motif (G140LASG144), and
symmetry arguments suggest that a similar change may occur at a cytoplasmic
GxxxG-like motif (S336DIFG340) in TM11.

In the present work, we examine the effect of substrate on covalent
modification of S336C, which lies in the loop connecting TM10 and
TM11 in the homology model for OxlT, and we demonstrate that there
are substrate-induced structural changes at the cytoplasmic end of
TM11. In the OxlT homology model, residues S143 and S336 are separated
by 21 Å; however, these residues lie within GxxxG and GxxxG-like
motifs that are known to mediate helix–helix interactions in
membrane proteins.26,27 Evidence for interactions at
these sites is obtained using a double-cysteine derivative, S143C/S336C,
which is found to readily undergo spontaneous cross-linking. Site-directed
spin labeling (SDSL) indicates that spin labels at these sites are
separated by a mean distance of 8 Å in the presence of substrate,
demonstrating that the cytoplasmic interfaces of these helices come
into close proximity during transport. This finding suggests that
the pore may be gated at the cytoplasmic side of the transporter by
the interaction of TM5 and TM11, perhaps through these GxxxG and GxxxG-like
motifs. Using pulse EPR, long-range distance measurements were made,
and they demonstrate that OxlT samples both inward-open and outward-open
states in the presence of substrate. In contrast to the homology model,
a state that is closed to the cytoplasm and open to the periplasmic
space is found to be significantly populated.

Experimental Procedures
Construction
of Mutants and Protein Expression
A cysteine-less
template (C28G/C271A) with a C-terminal nine-histidine tag (His9) in pBluescript II SK+28,29 was the parent for subsequent site-directed mutagenesis. Mutants
were generated using QuikChange (Stratagene) and confirmed at the
Johns Hopkins DNA sequencing facility. For disulfide trapping/cross-linking,
mutations were placed in a cysteine-less variant carrying a tandem
Factor Xa cleavage site in the central loop.30 For expression,31 OxlT in pBluescript
II SK+ was transformed into Escherichia
coli strain XL3 (strain XL1 containing plasmid pMS421
(Specr, LacIq)), grown overnight in a shaker
in 25–50 mL of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium in the presence
of 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL spectinomycin, and
diluted into 1.5 L of fresh LB broth with antibiotics (as indicated
above) to a starting optical density (OD) at 650 nm (OD650) of 0.025–0.03. This diluted sample was grown with shaking
until OD650 reached 0.1, at which point 1 mM IPTG was added.
After 3 to 4 h (OD650 = 0.35–0.6), the cells were
harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.5) as a concentrated stock (OD650 of ca. 35), and
frozen at −80 °C until use. No mutational alterations
were observed in plasmids sequenced after expression.

Disulfide Trapping
and Cross-Linking
For cross-linking
and disulfide trapping experiments, cells expressing OxlT were harvested
by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) at
OD650 ∼ 20, and washed by low-speed centrifugation
in the same buffer. To prepare membrane vesicles, cells were subjected
to high-pressure lysis (18 000 psi) in a French pressure cell.
Debris and unbroken cells were removed by low-speed centrifugation;
vesicles were collected from the supernatant by high-speed centrifugation
(150 000g for 1 h), washed by centrifugation
at 150 000g for 1 h with 20 mM Tris·HCl
(pH 7.5), resuspended in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 20% glycerol
at 200–400 μg protein/mL, and frozen at −80 °C
until use (&lt;2 weeks).30 For cross-linking,
vesicles were diluted in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) to 20 μg
protein/mL and treated with 200 μM Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3 for 10 min at 37 °C or 200 μM of either of two
homobifunctional MTS reagents (1,1-methanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate,
MTS-1-MTS, and 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate, MTS-2-MTS)
for 10 min at 23 °C. The reactions were then immediately quenched
by addition of 5 mM N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) and 10
mM EDTA, and vesicles were washed once by resuspension in 20 mM Tris·HCl
(pH 7.5) and pelleted at 290 000g for 26 min.
The final pellet was resuspended to 0.2–0.5 μg/μL
in 20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, and 1% DDM. A solution of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 2
mM CaCl2, and 50% glycerol, with or without Factor Xa protease
(0.1 mg/mL final concentration) (New England Biolabs), was diluted
1 to 9 into the vesicle suspension, and the mixture was incubated
for 6 h on a rotary platform at 4 °C. Control and protease-treated
samples were quenched with an equal volume of heated SDS-PAGE loading
buffer (12 M urea, 4% SDS, 100 mM Tris·HCl pH 6.8, 20% glycerol,
and 0.01% bromophenol blue) before immunoblot analysis using a monoclonal
antibody directed against the OxlT C-terminal polyhistidine tag.30 In some experiments and for functional assays
following reconstitution, vesicles were solubilized after cross-linking
using 100 mM oxalate, 20% glycerol, 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH
7.5), 0.2% E. coli polar lipid (Avanti
Polar Lipids, Inc.), and 0.5% DDM.24

Site-Directed Spin Labeling
Cells derived from 1.5
L cultures were processed as described above and then diluted into
20 mL (final) of 200 mM potassium oxalate, 20 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.5), and 20% glycerol in the presence of 0.25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. The suspension was placed in an ice/water bath, and cells
were disrupted by sonication for 5 min using a Sonic Dismembrator
model 500 (Fisher Scientific) set to 30% amplitude with an on pulse
of 10 s and off pulse of 5 s. After sonication, DDM was added to 0.5%,
and lysed material was solubilized for 1 h on a rotary platform in
a cold room (4 °C). Solubilized material was clarified by ultracentrifugation
at 149 000g for 30 min, after which the extract
was incubated with Ni-NTA (Qiagen) for 4–5 h (1 mL of resin/L
of cell culture) along with 500 μM TCEP (Sigma-Aldrich). This
mixture was then passed into a column, followed by a wash of the retained
Ni-NTA resin with 10 bed volumes of 100 μM TCEP, 200 mM potassium
oxalate, 0.02% DDM, 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol,
and 80 mM imidazole. An additional wash of 5 bed volumes was carried
out in 0.02% DDM, 100 mM potassium oxalate, 20 mM potassium phosphate
(pH 7.5), and 20% glycerol without TCEP (buffer 2). To spin-label
single- and double-cysteine OxlT mutants, 0.5 mM MTSL (Toronto Research
Chemicals) was freshly prepared in buffer 2 and added to protein-bound
Ni-NTA resin at 130% Ni-NTA bed volume. The reaction was allowed to
proceed for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. The column was
then washed with 25 bed volumes of buffer 2, after which purified
OxlT was eluted by addition of a solution of 20% glycerol, 100 mM
potassium oxalate (pH 4.2), and 0.02% DDM. Eluted samples were titrated
to pH 7 by addition of a one-ninth volume of 1 M potassium phosphate
(pH 8.5). The efficiency of labeling was assessed by monitoring the
reactivity of unreacted thiols to 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (Sigma-Aldrich),32 using the OxlT cysteine-less variant as the
negative control. For single-cysteine mutants, labeling efficiency
was 86 ± 6% (standard deviation) for the six mutants tested (range
79–92%); for the double-cysteine variants, labeling was 88
± 6% complete for the five variants examined (range 80–95%).
In some cases, protein was purified without spin-labeling for functional
work. As required, protein was concentrated to 5–13 mg/mL using
an Amicon 30 kDa cutoff centrifugal filter device (Millipore).

EPR spectroscopy was performed using solubilized protein purified
as described above or with protein that had been reconstituted by
detergent dilution (see below) at a protein/lipid ratio of ∼1:18
(w/w).

Reconstitution of OxlT and Assay of Oxalate Transport
Crude detergent extracts or purified material was used for reconstitution
by a detergent-dilution protocol, in which proteoliposomes were loaded
with 100 mM potassium oxalate and 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7)
as described.23,24 OxlT function was assessed by
following exchange of internal cold oxalate with external 14[C]oxalate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), using
either of two methods. First, and in most cases, 200 μL aliquots
of a proteoliposome suspension were spotted onto 0.22 μM GSTF
filters (Millipore) on a vacuum manifold, followed by two washes with
5 mL of assay buffer (100 mM potassium sulfate, 50 mM potassium phosphate,
pH 7). After disengaging the vacuum, OxlT function was monitored by
overlaying trapped proteoliposomes with 0.2 mL of 0.1 mM 14[C]oxalate prepared in the assay buffer; 14[C]oxalate
transport was terminated after 1 min by vacuum filtration, immediately
followed by two 5 mL washes with assay buffer. To assess the effects
of MTSCE (Toronto Research Chemicals), trapped proteoliposomes were
overlaid for 5 min with 0.3 mL of MTSCE freshly prepared at the indicated
concentrations in assay buffer. MTSCE was removed by vacuum filtration
and two washes with assay buffer, after which residual OxlT function
was monitored as described above. Similar methods were used to monitor
the effect of substrate on MTSCE reactivity with OxlT single-cysteine
mutants. In these cases, trapped proteoliposomes were exposed to increasing
amounts of external substrate (0–1 mM oxalate) in the presence
of an MTSCE concentration initially causing 50% inhibition of OxlT
function.24 In the second approach of transport
measurement (where better time resolution was required), proteoliposomes
were washed twice by centrifugation in ice-cold assay buffer using
a Beckman Optima ultracentrifuge (290 000g, 26 min) or in a Beckman L5-50E ultracentrifuge (150 000g, 60 min), and resuspended in 0.45 mL of assay buffer.
Subsequently, 0.1 mL aliquots were added to 0.8 mL of assay buffer
in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, followed 3 min later with the addition
of 0.1 mL of 1 mM 14[C]oxalate to achieve a final concentration
of 0.1 mM 14[C]oxalate. At specified times, 0.1 mL portions
were removed for vacuum filtration and washing as described above.
In experiments requiring disulfide reduction, the proteoliposome suspension
was supplemented with 10 mM DTT for 20 min prior to assay.

EPR Spectroscopy
For EPR spectroscopy, 6–10
μL of OxlT at a concentration of approximately 40–120
μM in DDM or lipid bilayers was loaded into borosilicate glass
capillary tubes 0.6 mm i.d. × 0.84 mm o.d. (Vitrocom, Mountain
Lakes, NJ). EPR spectra were recorded at 23 °C on a Bruker EMX
X-band spectrometer equipped with an ER4123D dielectric resonator
using 2 mW incident microwave power, 1 G field modulation, and a scan
range of 200 G. The spectra were normalized and baseline-corrected.
Distances between labels were determined using a Fourier deconvolution
approach implemented in the LabVIEW-based program ShortDistances provided
by Dr. Christian Altenbach (UCLA).33 Pulse
EPR measurements were performed on 25–30 μL samples loaded
into 2 mm i.d. × 2.4 mm o.d. quartz capillaries (Fiber Optic
Center, Inc., New Bedford, MA) that were flash frozen in a dry ice/isopropanol
bath. The DEER data were recorded at 80 K at X-band frequency using
a Bruker Elexsys-E580 spectrometer fitted with an ER4118X-MS3 split
ring resonator (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA). Data were acquired
using a four-pulse DEER sequence,34 with
a 16 ns π/2 and two 32 ns π observe pulses separated by
a 40 ns π pump pulse. The dipolar evolution times were typically
2.0–2.5 μs. The pump frequency was set to the maximum
of the central transition of the nitroxide spectrum, and the observe
frequency was set to the low-field maximum, typically 65–70
MHz higher. The dipolar evolution data were processed using the model-free
approach implemented in the MATLAB-based program DeerAnalysis 2013.35 A background dimensionality of 3 was chosen
for the initial background subtraction used to process the data. The
validation routine in DeerAnalysis was then used to determine the
background subtraction that produced the best fit to the dipolar evolution
and to estimate likely errors in the distance distribution.

Results
Cysteine
Modification Reveals Substrate-Dependent Structural
Changes in TM5 and TM11 of OxlT
In previous work, a single-cysteine
derivative on the cytoplasmic end of TM5, S143C, was found to be more
reactive to MTSCE in the presence than in the absence of external
oxalate, indicating that a substrate-dependent conformational change
occurs at the cytoplasmic end of OxlT.24 In OxlT, the symmetry-related partner to TM5 is TM11 (Figure 1); the cysteine mutant
S336C near the cytoplasmic end of TM11 was purified and reconstituted
into liposomes, and its reactivity to MTSCE was tested as described
previously.24 In this experiment, cysteine
derivatization is monitored from the loss in transport activity that
takes place when the cysteine reacts with MTSCE. It should be noted
that OxlT is symmetrically oriented across proteoliposomes and that
MTSCE has access to both interfaces.24 Oxalate-loaded
proteoliposomes were initially treated with MTSCE in the absence of
external oxalate, and, as seen in Figure 2a,
there is a loss of transport activity for S336C as the MTSCE concentration
is increased. From Figure 2a, the level of
MTSCE producing 50% inhibition was determined, and proteoliposomes
(from the same initial stock preparation) were pretreated with this
concentration of MTSCE and simultaneously mixed with increasing concentrations
of external unlabeled oxalate prior to assaying oxalate transport.
As seen in Figure 2b, increasing the concentration
of external oxalate reduces the transport activity in the presence
of MTSCE, indicating that MTSCE reactivity is enhanced by external
cold oxalate. As a positive control, S143C was also examined and was
found to respond as seen previously; as shown in Figures 2c,d, the effect of oxalate on transport in the presence
of MTSCE indicates that there is an elevated reactivity to MTSCE in
the presence of external oxalate. These experiments demonstrate that
for both TM5 and TM11 there are substrate-dependent conformational
changes during substrate exchange that result in elevated reactivities
of residues near the cytoplasmic portions of these helices.

Figure 1 GlpT-based
homology model of OxlT23 showing
the transport lining helices, TM5 (tan) and TM11 (magenta) (PDB ID: 1ZC7). The approximate
location of the Factor Xa cleavage site on the C-terminal end of the
loop between TM6 and TM7 is indicated. The transporter is in a cytoplasmic
open configuration where the Cα carbons of residues near the
ends of TM5 and TM11 (S336 and S143) are separated by 21 Å. Other
helices in the N-terminal domain are colored in cyan, and the remaining
helices in the C-terminal domain are in light green. Both the C- and
N-termini are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

Figure 2 MTSCE inhibition of transport for S143C and
S336C. Purified single-cysteine
OxlT mutants were reconstituted into liposomes to form proteoliposomes
under conditions where they were loaded with nonradiolabeled (cold)
oxalate. The proteoliposomes were washed on a filter, treated with
MTSCE, washed again, and assayed for 14[C]oxalate uptake.
As MTSCE concentrations are increased, there is a loss in 14[C]oxalate uptake for (a) S336C and (c) S143C in the absence of any
external nonradiolabeled oxalate. In a second experiment, the proteoliposomes
were washed, incubated with MTSCE sufficient to produce a 50% inhibition
in transport and simultaneously with increasing concentrations of
external cold oxalate, washed again, and then assayed for 14[C]oxalate transport. The residual 14[C]oxalate transport
as a function of external cold oxalate concentration is shown for
(b) S336C and (d) S143C. Each data point is the average of three measurements.

The Cytoplasmic Ends of
TM5 and TM11 Are Easily Cross-Linked
in OxlT
In the homology model for OxlT,23 the Cα atoms of S143 and S336 are separated by ∼21
Å (Figure 1). These sites are also located
in GxxxG and GxxxG-like motifs that are often found at the cytoplasmic
ends of TM5 and TM11 in MFS transporters (see Supporting Information Table S1). Because the data in Figure 2 indicate that there are conformational changes
at the ends of TM5 and TM11 and because GxxxG and GxxxG-like motifs
often mediate helix–helix interactions,26 we tested whether S143C and S336C could be cross-linked.
In these experiments, we used an OxlT variant having a tandem Factor
Xa cleavage site in the central loop that links the N- and C-terminal
domains. The cross-linking was carried out in native inner membrane
vesicles (see Experimental Procedures) using
copper(II) (1,10)-(phenanthroline)3 (a zero-length cross-linking
agent), MTS-1-MTS (∼3 Å spacer), and MTS-2-MTS (∼5
Å spacer). The cross-linked protein was examined on SDS-PAGE
before and after Factor Xa protease cleavage.30 As shown in Figure 3, cross-linking takes
place with all the agents used, suggesting that S143C and S336C interact.

Figure 3 Western
blot demonstrating cross-linking of S143C/S336C in native
vesicles. Native membrane vesicles (see Experimental
Procedures) containing OxlT with the S143C/S336C mutations
and a tandem Factor Xa cleavage site were treated with 200 μM
copper(II)(1,10-phenanthroline)3(CuPhe), 200 μM MTS-1-MTS
(M1M), or 200 μM MTS-2-MTS (M2M) for 10 min and immediately
quenched with 5 mM NEM and 10 mM EDTA. Washed vesicles were processed
for western blotting and probed with a C-terminal polyhistidine antibody.
Xlink indicates lanes with the addition of the indicated cross-linking
agents; Factor Xa indicates lanes where the central loop of OxlT has
been cleaved; DTT indicates lanes where DTT is used to reduce disulfides
after Factor Xa cleavage. The positions of the covalently intact protein
(OxlT), the C-terminal OxlT fragment (C-ter), and OxlT oligomer (OxlTn)
are indicated.

As seen in Figure 3, cross-linking appears
to take place between S143C and S336C in native membrane vesicles
in the absence of an oxidizing or cross-linking agent. We also determined
whether OxlT remains cross-linked in liposomes and whether cross-linking
inhibits oxalate transport in proteoliposomes. In this experiment,
native membrane vesicles were treated with buffer (control) or freshly
prepared copper(II) (1,10-phenanthroline)3, washed, and
solubilized in a solution of 100 mM oxalate, 20% glycerol, 20 mM potassium
phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.2% E. coli polar
lipid, and 0.5% DDM, and solubilized extracts were reconstituted into
oxalate-loaded liposomes. An aliquot of proteoliposomes was quenched
with NEM and EDTA and processed for protease cleavage while a second
aliquot was assayed for transport without quenching. As seen in Figure 4a, a western blot of the cleaved samples indicates
significant spontaneous intramolecular cross-linking between S143C
and S336C. Furthermore, as seen in Figure 4b, cross-linking inhibits transport and this inhibition may be reversed
by externally added DTT (Figure 4b). As expected,
the cys-less control does not show evidence of cross-linking when
examined on SDS-PAGE or in a transport assay (Figure S1). The results demonstrate that S143C and S336C remain
cross-linked in liposomes and suggest that movement at the cytoplasmic
ends of helices 5 and 11 is necessary for oxalate transport in OxlT.

Figure 4 Cross-linking
of OxlT S143C/S336C and transport in liposomes. E.
coli vesicles containing OxlT with S143C/S336C
and a tandem Factor Xa cleavage site were subjected to an oxidizing
agent or buffer alone prior to reconstitution into oxalate-loaded
vesicles of E. coli polar lipids. (a)
Proteoliposomes were immediately quenched with 5 mM NEM after reconstitution
and processed for western blotting using a polyhistidine antibody.
(b) Another aliquot was assayed for 14[C]oxalate transport
in the presence of an oxidizing agent without (○) and with
(●) the addition of DTT and in the absence of cross-linking
agent without (△) and with (▲) DTT. Each point was measured
in triplicate.

Additional measurements
were made on ice (∼4 °C) to
examine the effect of substrate on cross-linking. At this lower temperature,
conformational exchange between states is slowed, and structures induced
by substrate are stabilized. As a result, the effects of substrate
on cross-linking should be better resolved. In these measurements,
native membrane vesicles were isolated in the presence of potassium
sulfate (nonsubstrate) or potassium oxalate (substrate) to create
vesicles containing sulfate or oxalate on both sides of the membrane.
Vesicles lacking either salt (empty vesicles) were also created in
the presence of 20 mM Tris·HCl (see Figure 5, legend). As shown in Figure 5a, addition
of substrate (oxalate) to the exterior of empty vesicles inhibits
cross-linking compared to the sulfate-treated control. Remarkably,
the addition of oxalate to both sides of the membrane (Figure 5b) results in enhanced cross-linking relative to
the case where oxalate is added only on the exterior of empty vesicles
(Figure 5a). The apparent cross-linking rate
is independent of intra- or extra-vesicular placement of sulfate,
which is consistent with the idea that sulfate is not a substrate
of OxlT. In these native membrane vesicles, OxlT appears to have an
inverted orientation,36 and the result
indicates that the cytoplasmic ends of helices 5 and 11 are more likely
to be in close proximity when oxalate is present on both sides of
the membrane than when oxalate is present only on one surface of the
transporter. Since OxlT is able to carry out oxalate/oxalate self-exchange
and is an obligate exchanger rather than a uniporter,37 conditions that support exchange appear to facilitate proximity
of the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM11.

cross-linking of S143C/S336C FXa. OxlT in
native vesicles with S143C/S336C and a tandem Factor Xa cleavage site
was treated with the oxidizing agent copper(II) phenanthroline. Cross-linking
was followed on ice by quenching the samples at specific times by
adding them to tubes preloaded with 5 mM N-ethyl
maleimde and 10 mM EDTA, followed by cleavage with Factor Xa. (a)

Site-Directed Spin Labeling Indicates That the Cytoplasmic Ends
of TM5 and TM11 Are in Close Proximity in the Presence of Substrate
Site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy were used to test
for the proximity of S143C and S336C. The dipolar interaction between
spin labels leads to a broadening in the EPR spectrum, and distance
measurements may be made in the 8–20 Å range at room temperature.33 The double mutant, S143C/S336C, as well as the
corresponding single-cysteine mutants, were labeled with the MTSL
spin label (see Experimental Procedures) to
attach the R1 side chain (Figure 6). Labeling
efficiencies were 85–95% in all cases, as determined from the
thiol reactivity to DTDP32 (see Experimental Procedures). Continuous wave (CW) EPR
spectra were recorded for S143R1, S336R1, and S143R1/S336R1. As seen
in Figure 6a,b, strong dipolar coupling is
observed for this pair, which corresponds to distances of 7.8 and
8 Å in bilayers and DDM micelles, respectively. Placing the labeled
pair further toward the cytoplasmic surface at I338R1 and L141R1 does
not result in any significant dipolar coupling, and the interspin
distance exceeds 20 Å in bilayer and DDM preparations (Figure 6c,d).

The spin-labeled
side chain R1 was derivatized to double mutants as well as pairs of
the corresponding single-cysteine mutants of OxlT, and X-band EPR
spectra were recorded at room temperature. Spectra are shown for the
interacting spin pairs (blue traces) and the equivalent spectra without
dipolar interactions (black traces). The non-interacting spectra are
obtained from the sum of the single-labeled spectra. (a, b) Spectra
for S143R1/S336R1 in bilayers and DDM, respectively, where the simulated
spectrum obtained from the distance distribution is shown (dashed
red trace). The sample in panel a yielded a mean distance of 7.8 Å
with a standard deviation of 0.3 Å from three independent experiments.
(c, d) Spectra for L141R1/I338R1, which do not show evidence for strong
dipolar interaction, for bilayer and DDM environments, respectively.
The scans shown are 150 G. Distances were determined using a Fourier
deconvolution approach implemented in the LabVIEW program Short Distances
(provided by Christian Altenbach, UCLA).

In addition to these spin pairs, six additional spin pairs
were
produced to examine distances between TM5 and TM11 (see Figures S2 and S3a–d), and the distances
measured by CW methods are summarized in Table 1. The spin pair S143R1/S336R1 appears to yield the shortest distance
between the cytoplasmic regions of TM5 and TM11, and the spin pair
S143R1/I338R1 yields a distance of 17 Å in both DDM and liposomes
(Figure S2a,b), consistent with the helical
structure in the homology model. As a control, an i, i + 2 pair (S336R1/I338R1) was examined and yielded
a distance of 14.3 Å (see Figure S3e), which is close to the distance expected between R1 side chains
at i, i + 2 positions in a helix.38 For completeness, we attempted to make measurements
on substrate-free OxlT. Dipolar coupling was not observed between
S143R1/S336R1 in the absence of substrate; however, these measurements
were problematic because OxlT is not stable in the absence of substrate
(see Figure S4).

The Periplasmic and Cytoplasmic
Regions of OxlT Sample Both
Open and Closed States
Pulse EPR measurements, such as double
electron–electron resonance (DEER), yield both distances and
distance distributions between spin labels beyond 20 Å. Shown
in Figure 7 are
DEER measurements and distance distributions obtained for OxlT in
the presence of substrate in DDM micelles. Shown in Figure 7a are measurements made across the periplasmic surface
of OxlT, and distances measured across the cytoplasmic region are
shown in Figure 7b. Also shown are the predicted
R1–R1 distance distributions obtained from the homology model.

Figure 7 Distances
and distance distributions measured by double electron–electron
resonance (DEER) for several spin pairs in OxlT. (a) Measurements
across the periplasmic end of OxlT. The background-corrected DEER
data is shown on the left (black traces) along with the fits to the
data using a model-free approach (red traces). The distributions obtained
are shown on the right, and an error range is indicated by the vertical
error bars (shaded in gray) in the distribution. This error range
is based on uncertainty in the background subtraction and dimensionality
in the background form factor that produces fits within 15% of the
RMSD of the best fits. These errors were obtained using the validation
routine in DeerAnalysis. Shown in magenta are predictions of the distances
and distance distributions based on the OxlT homology model using
the PyMOL plug-in mtsslWizard.52 (b) Measurements
across the cytoplasmic end of OxlT. (c) Homology model of OxlT along
with the labeled sites used for DEER. Raw DEER data were processed
and analyzed using the Matlab software package DEER Analysis.35

As seen in Figure 7, there are multiple
distances in most of these distributions. A portion of these distributions
may be contributed by spin-labeled side chain (R1) rotamers; however,
a comparison of the predicted distributions with the experimental
distributions indicates that R1 rotamers cannot account for the broad
distributions seen. These distributions indicate the presence of conformational
heterogeneity in OxlT, perhaps due to conformational exchange between
two or more states. On the periplasmic surface, two or more major
distances are usually seen in the distribution, and, in many cases,
the shorter distance corresponds closely with that expected from the
homology model. On the cytoplasmic surface, there is less heterogeneity,
but the predicted distances from the homology model are in 3 out of
4 cases examined significantly longer than distances measured by DEER.
It should be noted that the spin pair L141R1/I338R1 yields a mean
interspin distance of 28.5 Å, which is in agreement with the
model and consistent with the lack of any significant dipolar broadening
in the corresponding CW spectrum seen in Figure 6.

Several additional measurements made across OxlT are shown
in Figure S6. These measurements include
distances
across the length of OxlT as well as one additional measurement between
TM5 and TM8 at the periplasmic interface. The distances measured are
in general agreement with predictions based on the homology model,
but there is clear heterogeneity when the measurement is made from
the cytoplasmic end of TM1 to the periplasmic end of TM8. Taken together,
the data in Figures 7 and S6 indicate that OxlT samples multiple structural states,
where one highly populated state found in the presence of substrate
is more compact on the cytoplasmic surface and more expanded on the
periplasmic surface than the homology model.

Several Labels at the Cytoplasmic
Ends of TM5 and TM11 Inhibit
Transport
A number of the spin-labeled and reconstituted
OxlT mutants were assayed for substrate binding and function. These
spin-labeled mutants were found to bind substrate (Figure S4) by criteria used previously;39,40 however, many of the spin-labeled mutants located near the cytoplasmic
and periplasmic interfaces of TM5 and TM11 showed reduced or no transport.
As seen in Figure S7, treatment of proteoliposomes
with externally added DTT restored function in many cases, suggesting
that the OxlT mutants must be correctly folded into the membrane and
that chemical modification of the cysteines is primarily responsible
for the loss of transport activity. Helices TM5 and TM11 line the
oxalate permeation pathway,5,23−25 and the spin label may act to block access to the pathway or interfere
with substrate movement along the pore. Consistent with this idea,
OxlT mutants retain function when the R1 labels are placed at locations
more distant from the permeation pathway.

Discussion
High-resolution
crystal structures are now available for a number
of membrane transport proteins, including the MFS family of transporters.5−20 However, in the case of the MFS transporters, as is the case with
many transport proteins, the detailed steps in transport remain unknown.
Recent work using spectroscopic methods indicates that membrane transporters
can assume multiple states, which are often in equilibrium.41,42 Such conformational sampling is difficult to characterize but is
thought to underlie protein–protein interactions, allostery,
and protein function.43 Crystal structures
do not reveal these conformational equilibria, and they often trap
the protein in a specific substate, which may be populated as a result
of the crystallization conditions.44

In the present study, cysteine mutagenesis,45,46 disulfide trapping,47 and EPR spectroscopy48 were used to examine conformational changes
at the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM11, which line the transport
pore. Pulse EPR was also used to characterize the overall conformation
of OxlT in the context of a previously generated homology model. One
motivation for this study was the presence of GxxxG and GxxxG-like
motifs at the cytoplasmic ends of helices 5 and 11 of OxlT and several
well-studied MFS members. Since these motifs are known to mediate
helix–helix interactions,26,27 they might
mediate helix–helix contact to close off the substrate pore
at the cytoplasmic interface during the transport cycle.

Previous
work demonstrated that there were substrate-dependent
conformational changes in S143C (a position in a GxxxG motif in the
cytoplasmic end of TM5),24 and the observation
that S336C resides in the symmetry-related SxxxG motif of TM11 (also
at the cytoplasmic end of helix 11) suggested that there might be
similar conformational changes at this site. The results of site-directed
alkylation (Figure 2) and disulfide cross-linking
(Figures 3–5)
indicate that substrate-coupled conformational changes occur in OxlT
and that these conformational changes place the cytoplasmic ends of
helices 5 and 11 in close proximity. Moreover, SDSL demonstrates that
S143R1/S336R1 are in close proximity, in agreement with the cross-linking
of this pair. From this work, the cytoplasmic poles of helices 5 and
11 must move closer, relative to the inward-open GlpT-based homology
model23 and the occluded electron crystallographic
structure of OxlT.5

A partial closure
of the cytoplasmic end of GlpT, mediated by TM5
and TM11, has been observed in molecular dynamics simulations.49 In that study, which used the crystal structure
of GlpT in the inward-open conformation,6 substrate binding was observed to stabilize a partially occluded
state where TM5 and TM11 approach each other on the cytoplasmic side
at regions that constitute GxxxS/GxxxG motifs in GlpT. The findings
presented here are consistent with this proposal, but they indicate
that larger movements of these helices take place to bring the cytoplasmic
regions of TM5 and TM11 together.

The data presented here indicate
that OxlT samples an outward-open
state that resembles the FucP crystal structure.9 A comparison of several sites between the FucP structure
and the OxlT data is shown in Figure S8. Among the currently available MFS structures, the FucP structure
places the cytoplasmic poles of helices 5 and 11 in the closest proximity.
This is consistent with the short distances measured by CW EPR between
the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM11 in OxlT and the DEER measurements
on the periplasmic ends of TM5 and TM11, Figure 7a, which are much longer than those predicted by the homology model.
As seen in Figure 7b, the most populated distances
measured by DEER for the cytoplasmic surface of OxlT are shorter than
those predicted by the model, with longer distances being populated
on the periplasmic surface. Although an outward-facing state is present
and may even dominate the population under these conditions for OxlT,
it should be noted that multiple distances are present, particularly
at the periplasmic interface, and that some combination of both outward-open
and inward-open states are likely to be present and in equilibrium.
This finding is similar to that seen for the aspartate transporter,
GltPh, where multiple distances are seen, indicating that both inward-
and outward-facing states appear to be present in bilayers.42,50

The “rocker-switch” hypothesis22 proposes that transport is mediated by a relative scissor-like
motion of the N- and C-terminal domains. This hypothesis implies that
there must be contact at the cytoplasmic and periplasmic ends of OxlT
that create effective seals during OxlT turnover. In support of this
hypothesis, cross-linking has been observed between TM1 (N-terminal
domain) and TM7 (C-terminal domain) at the periplasmic end of OxlT,23 as well as substrate-dependent proximity between
TM1 and TM7 at the center of FucP.51 The
present work demonstrates that there is an interaction between TM5
(N-terminal domain) and TM11 (C-terminal domain) at the cytoplasmic
side and is also consistent with this hypothesis.

In summary,
the results presented here demonstrate that interactions
take place between the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM11 and that OxlT
samples an inward-closed state in the presence of substrate. Moreover,
pulse EPR measurements show that the protein samples more than one
state when substrate is present and may be in exchange between states
that can be described as both open and closed. These data are consistent
with the expectations drawn from molecular dynamics work on GlpT,49 and they suggest that OxlT may sample a structure
that resembles the structure obtained for FucP.9 The cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM11 contain GxxxG and
GxxxG-like motifs that are frequently found at the cytoplasmic ends
of TM5 and TM11 in MFS members. Although not specifically tested in
the present study, the results are consistent with the idea that these
motifs can function to transiently close and limit cytoplasmic access
to the transport pathway.
