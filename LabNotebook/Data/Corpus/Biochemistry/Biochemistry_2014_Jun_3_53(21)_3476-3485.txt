The amidohydrolase superfamily
(AHS) was first identified by Holm and Sander on the basis of the
three-dimensional structural similarity of phosphotriesterase, adenosine
deaminase, and urease. Since its discovery
in 1997, more than 23,000 proteins have been identified as members
of this superfamily. Proteins in the AHS fold as a distorted (β/α)8-barrel and, in most cases, contain a metal center embedded
at the C-terminal end of the β-barrel with conserved metal binding
and catalytic residues originating from the ends of β-strands
1, 4, 5, 6, and 8. The AHS is an ensemble
of evolutionarily related enzymes capable of catalyzing a diverse
set of chemical reactions, including the hydrolysis of amide or ester
bonds, deamination of nucleic acids, decarboxylation, isomerization,
and hydration reactions.

The NCBI
has classified proteins from completely sequenced bacterial
genomes that perform the same or similar functions into Clusters of
Orthologous Groups (COG). Within the AHS, there are 24 identifiable
COGs. For this investigation we have focused on the identification
of unknown proteins contained within cog1735. Sequence similarity
networks (SSNs) for cog1735 at BLAST E-value cutoffs
of 10–70 and 10–40 are presented
in Figure  for approximately 450 proteins. In this figure the groups of proteins have been
arbitrarily numbered and color-coded. Enzymes from this COG have previously
been found to catalyze the hydrolysis of organophosphate triesters,, homoserine lactones,− γ- and δ-lactones, phosphorylated sugar lactones, and carboxylate esters.

from the amidohydrolase superfamily obtained at E-value cutoffs of 10–70 (left) and 10–40 (right). Each node in the network represents a single
sequence, and each edge (depicted as a line) represents the pairwise
connection between two sequences at the given BLAST E-value. Lengths of edges are not significant except that sequences
in tightly clustered groups are more similar to each other than sequences
with fewer connections. The triangular nodes represent proteins that
have been functionally and/or structurally characterized. Additional
information is presented in the text.

Two bacterial phosphotriesterases (PTE) from Pseudomonas
diminuta and Agrobacterium radiobacter have
been characterized from Group 8. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis
of organophosphates, including the insecticide paraoxon and the chemical
warfare agents GB, GD, and VX., Sso2522 from the hyperthermophlic Sulfolobus solfataricus belongs to Group 9, and this enzyme
has a very weak phosphotriesterase activity but hydrolyzes lactones
at significantly faster rates. Three
proteins from Group 3, Mt0240 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rer55000 from Rhodococcus erythropolis, and MAP3668c
from Mycobacterium avium, catalyze the hydrolysis
of N-acyl homeserine lactones.− A thermostable
lactonase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (gi|258588268) from Group 7 (PDB id: 3F4D) exhibits both phosphotriesterase and lactonase activities. The three-dimensional structure and substrate
profile of Dr0930 from Deinococcus radiodurans from
Group 7 have been determined (PDB id: 3FDK and 3HTW). This protein has very low phosphotriesterase
activity but efficiently hydrolyzes alkyl-substituted δ- and
γ-lactones., Recently, two proteins, Lmo2620
from Listeria monocytogenes (PDB id: 3PNZ) and Bh0225 from Bacillus halodurans, from Group 5 were shown to catalyze
the hydrolysis of d-lyxono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate and l-ribono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate.

Thus, far, enzymes from Groups 1, 2, 4, and 6 have not been
fully
functionally characterized, although the three-dimensional structures
for some proteins have been determined. For example, the PTE homology
protein (PHP, b3379) from Escherichia coli K12 (PDB
id: 1BF6) of
Group 1 and Pmi1525 (PDB id: 3RHG) from Proteus mirabilis of Group
2 have been structurally characterized, but the catalytic functions
of these two proteins remain undetermined. In addition, the structure of Ms0025 from Mycoplasma synoviae (PDB id: 3OVG) of Group 6 has been determined, but the substrate profile has not.
Here we report the three-dimensional structure of Rsp3690 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides from Group 4 and demonstrate that
it efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of carboxylate and organophosphonate
esters.

Materials and Methods
Materials
LB broth was purchased
from Tpi Research
Products International Corp. The HisTrap and gel filtration columns
were purchased from GE Healthcare. E. coli BL21(DE3)
competent cells were obtained from Stratagene. Standards for ICP-MS
were purchased from Inorganic Ventures Inc. All other buffers, purification
reagents, and chemicals used in this work were purchased from Sigma/Aldrich,
unless otherwise stated. Compounds 26–31 were synthesized as racemic mixtures as previously described. The (RP)- and (SP)-enantiomers of compound 32 were
isolated according to published procedures.

Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis
The plasmid containing
the gene for Rsp3690 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (gi|77465698) was obtained from NYSGXRC (New York SGX Research Consortium). The
mutant E175K was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis
method from Agilent. The primer pair used in the PCR amplification
of the E175K mutant was 5′-cgggtgatcggcaagatcggcgtttcctc-3′
and 5′-gaggaaacgccgatcttgccgatcagcccg-3′.

Purification of Rsp3690
The plasmid
encoding the gene
for Rsp3690 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3)
competent cells. A 5 mL culture of LB was inoculated with a single
colony from this transformation, incubated overnight, and then used
to inoculate 1 L of LB in the presence of 50 μg mL–1 kanamycin. The culture was grown with agitation at 30 °C to
an OD600 of 0.1–0.2. At this point 100 μM
of 2,2′-bipyridyl was added to reduce the incorporation of
iron in the expressed protein, and the
culture was then allowed to grow to an OD600 of 0.6. At
this point, the culture was supplemented with 1.0 mM Zn(OAc)2 (or MnCl2) and 0.5 mM isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and then allowed to grow at room temperature
for 16 h. The cell pellet was harvested by centrifugation and then
stored at −70 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in binding
buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole). The
suspension was lysed by sonication at 0 °C for 30 min, and then
the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation. The clarified
cell extract was filtered with a 0.2 μm syringe filter (VWR)
and loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap HP column, which was connected to an
ÄKTA purifier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously calibrated
with binding buffer. The column was washed thoroughly with binding
buffer, and then the target protein was eluted with a linear gradient
of elution buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.25 M NaCl, and 0.5 M imidazole).
The protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography
using a GE Healthcare Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column
that was precalibrated with 50 mM Hepes, pH 8.0. The mutant E175K
was expressed in the presence of 1.0 mM MnCl2 or CdCl2 and purified to homogeneity using the same procedure as for
the wild-type enzyme.

Metal Analysis
The protein concentration
was determined
spectrophotometrically at 280 nm in a 1 cm quartz cuvette using a
SPECTRAmax-340 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficient
at 280 nm used for determining the concentration of Rsp3690 was calculated
to be 28,795 M–1 cm–1 (http://ca.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). The metal content of the purified protein was determined using
inductively coupled plasma emission mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Before
ICP-MS measurements, the protein samples were digested with concentrated
nitric acid by refluxing for ∼30 min and then diluted with
distilled H2O until the final concentration of the nitric
acid was 1% (v/v) and the protein concentration was ∼1.0 μM.

Kinetic Measurements and Data Analysis
Activity screening
and kinetic measurements were performed using a SPECTRAmax-340 plate
reader. The hydrolysis of most carboxylate esters was monitored using
a pH-sensitive colorimetric assay. Protons released from the hydrolysis
reaction were measured using the pH indicator cresol purple., The reactions were performed in 2.5 mM Bicine buffer, pH 8.3, containing
0.2 M NaCl, various concentrations of substrate, 0.1 mM cresol purple,
and enzyme. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 2%
or 5%, depending on the solubility of the substrate. The change in
absorbance was monitored at 577 nm. The
effective extinction coefficient (ΔOD/M of H+) was
obtained from a titration with acetic acid at pH 8.3, 30 °C (ε
= 1.76 × 103 M–1 cm–1, 2% DMSO; ε = 1.68 × 103 M–1 cm–1, 5% DMSO).

The as-purified Rsp3690
was buffer-exchanged to contain 10 mM Bicine, pH 8.3, using a PD-10
desalting column. The carboxylate ester substrates were dissolved
in DMSO (100 mM) and then diluted into the reaction mixture. In the
absence of substrate, a background rate was observed due to the acidification
by atmospheric CO2. The background rate was independent
of the substrate concentration and subtracted from the initial rates
of the enzymatic reactions. For substrates
with 4-nitrophenol as the leaving group, activity screening and kinetic
measurements were monitored at 400 nm (ε = 1.7 × 104 M–1 cm–1), while for
substrates with 4-acetylphenol as the leaving group, the reactions
were monitored at 294 nm (ε = 7710 M–1 cm–1). For the compounds
4′-chloroacetanilide and 3-acetoxypyridine, the acetic acid
assay kit from Megazyme was used and the reaction was monitored at
340 nm (ε340 = 6,220 M–1 cm–1). When indoxyl acetate was used as a substrate, the
hydrolysis product was monitored at 678 nm in 50 mM Hepes buffer,
pH 8.3, 1% ethanol (ε = 7.0 × 103 M–1 cm–1).

Kinetic parameters were determined
by fitting the initial rates
to eq  using the nonlinear least-squares fitting
program in SigmaPlot 9.0, where ν is the initial velocity of
the reaction, Et is the enzyme concentration, kcat is the turnover number, [A] is the substrate
concentration, and Km is the Michaelis
constant:

Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection
The selenomethionine
(SeMet) derivative of Rsp3690 with a 6x-His tag was crystallized at
room temperature by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Diffraction
quality crystals were grown by mixing 1 μL of protein with 1
μL of reservoir solution and equilibrating the protein sample
against the corresponding reservoir solution. The protein sample was
in a buffer of 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM methionine,
10% glycerol, and 5 mM DTT at a concentration of 10 mg mL–1. The reservoir solution contained 25% PEG 3350, 0.2 M MgCl2, and 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5. Crystals appeared after 2 days and were
flash-cooled by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen using the mother
liquor supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol. A complete SAD data set
from a single SeMet crystal was collected at the selenium absorption
edge (λ = 0.979 Å) under standard cryogenic conditions
on beamline X29A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS),
Brookhaven National Laboratory. Crystals diffracted to 1.8 Å
and belong to the C centered monoclinic space group C2 with 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data were indexed, integrated,
and scaled using the program HKL2000. Crystal parameters, data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics
are given in Table .

Structure Determination and Refinement
The selenium
substructure was determined using SHELXD. The phase refinement and density modifications were carried out
using SHELXE. Model building was done
using ARP/wARP. Further model building
and refinement of the structure was carried out in iterative cycles
using the program O and CNS 1.1., Well-defined
residual electron density was observed in all four molecules and could
be modeled as DTT, which was added previously in the sample buffer.
In addition, two metal ions were located per molecule and included
in the later stages of refinement. On the basis of the electron density
(peak height) and coordination geometry, these two metal ions were
modeled as zinc. The quality of the final structure was verified with
a composite omit map, and stereochemistry was checked with the program
PROCHECK. The atomic coordinates and
structure factors for Rsp3690 have been deposited in the Protein Data
Bank under accession code 3k2g.

Results
Cloning, Expression, and
Purification of Rsp3690
The
gene for Rsp3690 was cloned and expressed as a C-terminal His-tagged
protein. Rsp3690 expressed well in E. coli after
induction with IPTG in the presence of added divalent metal ions (Zn(Ac)2 or MnCl2). The His-tagged protein was purified
using a combination of gel filtration and HisTrapHP column chromatography.
The purity of the isolated protein was estimated to be &gt;95% as
judged
by SDS gel electrophoresis. The enzyme, expressed in the presence
of Zn(OAc)2 in the growth medium, contained 1.5 equiv of
zinc and 0.4 equiv of iron per subunit. The concentrated protein was
purple in color and has an absorbance maximum at 530 nm. The protein
expressed in the presence of MnCl2 and 100 μM 2.2′-bipyridal
contained 1.0 equiv of manganese, 0.1 equiv of zinc, and 0.3 equiv
of iron and was also purple at high protein concentrations. The purified
E175K mutant expressed in the presence of MnCl2 contained
0.5 equiv of zinc, 0.1 equiv of iron, and 0.1 equiv of manganese.

Three-Dimensional Structure of Rsp3690
The three-dimensional
structure of Rsp3690 was determined to a resolution of 1.8 Å
with a homotetramer in the asymmetric unit (Figure ). The protein folds as a distorted (β/α)8-barrel with N-terminal and C-terminal extensions from both
sides of the barrel. The following chain segments are included in
the eight β-strands of the barrel: β-1 (residues 29–34),
β-2 (residues 100–103), β-3 (residues 126–129),
β-4 (residues 173–176), β-5 (residues 204–206),
β-6 (residues 232–234), β-7 (residues 256–259),
and β-8 (residues 297–299). There are two long helical
segments between strands β-1 and β-2 and between β-3
and β-4 of the barrel. The long segment between strands β-1and
β-2 protrudes out from one side of the active site and covers
part of the substrate entrance to the active site. The ribbon representation
of a single subunit is presented in Figure .

shown in green, yellow, cyan, and magenta. This figure was prepared
with PYMOL (http://www.pymol.org).

Ribbon representation of subunit A of Rsp3690. The eight β-strands
of the β-barrel are colored blue. The two metal atoms in the
active site are colored green. The long helical segment between β-1
and β-2 (colored red) protrudes out from one side of the protein
and covers part of the entrance to the active site. The loop between
β-7 and α-8 (colored purple) extends away from the protein
and also covers part of the entrance to the active site. The helical
segment between β-3 and β-4 is colored orange.

The active site is located at the C-terminal end
of the β-barrel
and is open to bulk solvent. Two metal ions are bound in the active
site, and the coordination geometry is illustrated in Figure . The most deeply buried and most solvent-exposed
metal ions are denoted as α and β, respectively. The α-metal
ion is coordinated by His-32 and His-34 from strand β-1, Asp-302
from strand β-8, and Glu-175 from strand β-4. The β-metal
ion is coordinated by His-207 from strand β-5, His-236 from
strand β-6, the bridging carboxylate from Glu-175, and a water
molecule. A second water molecule (or hydroxide) serves as an additional
bridging ligand between the two metal ions. The interatomic distance
between the two metal ions is 3.6 Å, and the distance to the
bridging water/hydroxide is 2.0–2.1 Å. The phenolic oxygen
of Tyr-134 is 2.7 Å from the β-zinc. This interaction is
assumed to be responsible for the absorbance at 530 nm from the formation
of a change transfer complex.

Coordination geometry of the metal center in
the active site of
Rsp3690. The α-metal ion and the β-metal ion are shown
as green spheres, and the bridging water molecule and the water coordinated
to the β-metal ion are shown as red spheres.

Interestingly, the structure of Rsp3690 was found
with a molecule
of DTT bound in the active site. The DTT molecule was presumably captured
from the purification buffer or the crystallization solution and formed
a disulfide bond with Cys-39 as illustrated in Figure . The six residues found within 6 Å of DTT included Asn-37,
Trp-42, Phe-72, Ile-109, Phe-304, and Val-305.

atoms are yellow, and the oxygen atoms are red.

Function Determination of Rsp3690
Rsp3690 from R.
sphaeroides belongs to Group 4 of cog1735 in the amidohydrolase
superfamily, and very little functional information is available for
close relatives of this enzyme. In the databases maintained by NCBI,
it is listed as a resiniferatoxin-binding protein. To determine the
substrate profile of Rsp3690, this protein was tested with organophosphate
esters, lactones, carboxylate esters, and peptide libraries. None
of the lactones or peptides tested was found to be a substrate for
this enzyme, but Rsp3690 did catalyze the hydrolysis of paraoxon (27) and 4-nitrophenyl acetate (5). The Mn-containing
Rsp3690 exhibited significantly higher activity relative to that of
the Zn-containing protein. When ZnCl2 was added to the
reaction mixture of the Zn-containing enzyme, the reaction rate decreased
as the Zn concentration increased. The enzyme lost all catalytic activity
when the Zn concentration was increased to 0.5 mM. When MnCl2 was added to the reaction mixture of the Zn- or Mn-containing proteins,
the reaction rate increased significantly up to a maximum at ∼400
μM MnCl2. Higher concentrations of MnCl2 did not further increase the reaction rate. The Mn-containing enzyme
was used throughout the substrate screening assays, and kinetic measurements
were supplemented with 400 μM MnCl2.

Since
the phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta has
very low but detectable activity with 2-naphthyl acetate (8), Rsp3690 was assayed with this compound and found to hydrolyze
this substrate with a kcat/Km of ∼105 M–1 s–1. On the basis of this result, Rsp3690 was further
screened with a variety of carboxylate esters. The kinetic constants
for the hydrolysis of organophosphate and carboxylate esters are presented
in Table . The structures of these compounds
are presented in Schemes  and .

Rsp3690 is a promiscuous enzyme
that is able to catalyze the hydrolysis
of a variety of substrates. Of the carboxylate esters, Rsp3690 catalyzes
the hydrolysis of 2-naphthyl propionate (16) and 4-nitrophenyl
butyrate (17) with kcat/Km values of 1.5 × 105 and 8.8
× 105 M–1 s–1,
respectively. Among the organophosphate compounds, Rsp3690 hydrolyzes
ethyl 4-nitrophenyl methylphosphonate (28) with a value
of kcat/km of 3.8 × 105 M–1 s–1. This enzyme has substantially less activity with paraoxon (27) and methyl paraoxon (26) with values of kcat/Km of 1.2 ×
104 and 5 × 103 M–1 s–1, respectively. In addition to the hydrolysis of carboxylate
and organophosphate esters, Rsp3690 can also catalyze the cleavage
of the C–N bond and C–S bond of 4-nitroacetanilide (14) and β-thionaphthylacetate (15) but
at a much lower rate. The kcat/Km values for these two compunds are 554 and
470 M–1 s–1, respectively.

The mutant E175K was purified and found to be completely inactive
toward the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl butyrate and ethyl 4-nitrophenyl
methylphosphonate. This mutant protein was also unable to hydrolyze
the organophosphate diester bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate.

Stereoselectivity
of Rsp3690
The stereoselectivity
of Rsp3690 for chiral organophosphonate substrates was addressed using
racemic isobutyl 4-nitrophenyl methylphosphonate (30).
The time courses for the hydrolysis of racemic 30 by
wild-type PTE and Rsp3690 are presented in Figure . The addition of wild-type PTE results in the hydrolysis
of approximately 50% of the total substrate. The addition of Rsp3690
after ∼27 min resulted in the hydrolysis of the remaining material
(Figure A). A similar time course was observed
when the order of enzyme addition was reversed (data not shown). From
the time courses for the hydrolysis of racemic 30 by
PTE alone (Figure B) and Rsp3690 (Figure C) it can be concluded that Rsp3690 and PTE preferentially
hydrolyze the opposite enantiomers from one another. Since PTE has
been shown previously to hydrolyze the (RP)-enantiomer of isobutyl 4-acetylphenyl methylphosphonate (32) 25 times faster than the (SP)-enantiomer, it can be concluded that
Rsp3690 prefers to hydrolyze the (SP)-enantiomer
of this substrate. For PTE, the (RP)-enantiomer
of compound 30 is hydrolyzed 75 times faster than the
(SP)-enantiomer based on a fit of the
data in Figure B to the sum of two exponentials. For Rsp3690, the (SP)-enantiomer of compound 30 is hydrolyzed 10 times faster
than the (RP)-enantiomer. For the hydrolysis
of the isolated enantiomers of (SP)-32 and (RP)-32, the
values of kcat/Km using Rsp3690 were determined to be 1200 ± 100 and 88
± 2 M–1 s–1, respectively.

Discussion
Substrate Profile for Rsp3690
Rsp3690
was shown to
catalyze the hydrolysis of a variety of carboxylate esters. The best
substrate was p-nitrophenyl butyrate (17) with a value of kcat/Km of ∼106 M–1 s–1. When the carboxylate group is shortened to acetate
(5) or increased to hexanoate (21), the
value of kcat/Km is reduced by a factor of ∼4–7 and further reduced
by a factor of 60 with octanoate (23). The nitro-substituent
of the phenolic leaving group contributes a factor of ∼20 to
the value of kcat/Km (5 vs 1). Simpler alcohols such
as benzyl, ethyl, and phenethyl (6, 7, 20, 24, and 25) are limited to kcat/Km values of
∼103 M–1 s–1. Amide bonds can also be hydrolyzed, but the rate of hydrolysis
is reduced by a factor of about 1,000 (14 vs 5). The hydrolysis of substrates with 2-naphthol as the leaving group
is nearly as proficient as the hydrolysis of substrates with p-nitrophenol (8 and 16). We were
unable to identify any lactones as a substrate for this enzyme, and
thus this is the first enzyme from cog1735 that has not been shown
to hydrolyze lactones.

We were able to identify a series of
organophosphates and organophosphonates as quite good substrates for
Rsp3690. In this regard, ethyl 4-nitrophenyl methyl phosphonates (28) is the best substrate with a value of kcat/Km of ∼4 ×
105 M–1 s–1. To the
best of our knowledge, this enzyme represents the first esterase from
cog1735 where the ability to hydrolyze organophosphonates is nearly
as good as the hydrolysis of carboxylate esters. For example, the
closely related enzyme from Group 7, Dr0930 from Deinococcus
radiodurans, hydrolyzes γ-lactones with values of kcat/Km that exceed
106 M–1 s–1, but the
catalytic efficiency for the hydrolysis of racemic 29 is less than 10 M–1 s–1. PTE from Pseudomonas diminuta hydrolyzes racemic 29 with a kcat/Km of 107 M–1 s–1 but hydrolyzes δ-nonanoic
lactone with a catalytic efficiency of less than 102 M–1 s–1., Rsp3690 also
exhibits stereoselectivity for the hydrolysis of chiral organophosphonates.
The (SP)-enantiomer of compound 30 is hydrolyzed ∼10 times faster than the less toxic
(RP)-enantiomer. The wild type PTE prefers
to hydrolyze the less toxic (RP)-enantiomer., The high turnover numbers for the hydrolysis of methyl phosphonate
esters and the preference for the hydrolysis of the more toxic (SP)-enantiomers make enzymes from Group 4 very
attractive targets for directed evolution for enhanced CW agent hydrolysis.

Structural Features of Rsp3690
Crystal structures have
been determined for carboxylate esterases from human,, plant, and microbial sources., Many of these carboxylate esterases belong to the α/β-hydrolase
superfamily and a catalytic triad of Ser, His, and Asp/Glu.− Carboxylate esterase activities have been identified within the
amidohydolase superfamily, but no crystal structures of these enzymes
have been solved. The active site of
Rsp3690 is hydrophobic, which helps to explain the observed substrate
specificity. The active site is open to solvent, and the eight loops
that immediately follow the eight β-strands from the central
β-barrel form a fence-like hydrophobic wall around the binuclear
metal center. The α-metal site is shielded by Loops 1, 2, 7,
and 8. Trp-42 from the long Loop 1 covers part of the active site
from above.

A protein sequence alignment of Rsp3690 and representative
proteins from the major groups of cog1735 is shown in Figure . All of the metal-binding residues are absolutely
conserved except for the residue that bridges the two metal ions.
In Rsp3690, Pmi1525, and the PTE homology protein from E.
coli, the bridging residue is glutamate. In Lmo2620, Dr0930,
and PTE this residue is a carboxylated lysine. A structural overlay
of three proteins (Rsp3690, Dr0930, and PTE) is presented in Figure . From this comparison it is obvious that the two
metals, the central β-barrel, and the interconnecting α-helices
superimpose quite nicely and that the major structural differences
among these proteins are due predominately to the conformation and
length of the eight loops that interconnect the β-strands and
the corresponding α-helices.

(Group 5), Dr0930 (Group 7), and PTE (Group 9). The metal binding
ligands are highlighted in red. The residues implicated in substrate
binding are highlighted in blue. The residues highlighted in olive
correspond to the eight loops identified in the three-dimensional
crystal structure of Rsp3690.

Structural comparison of the backbone conformations for Rsp3690,
Dr0930, and PTE. The eight β/α loops from Rsp3690, Dr0930,
and PTE are depicted in sienna, green, and gold, respectively. The
central β-barrel, the surrounding α-helices, and the two
metal atoms for the three proteins are depicted in gray. The RMSD
between Rsp3690/Dr0930, Rsp390/PTE, and Dr0930/PTE for those parts
of the three proteins depicted in gray are 1.0, 1.1, and 0.9 Å,
respectively.

The differences in the
substrate specificity exhibited by the major
groups of proteins contained within cog1735 must be dictated by the
composition and conformation of the eight loops that extend outward
from the central β-barrel. For example, Afriat-Jurnou et al.
have remodeled Loop 7 of PTE to create a variant of the enzyme that
led to the emergence of homoserine lactonase activity that is undetectable
in wild-type PTE. Meier et al. modified
the loops contained within the active site of Dr0930 and enhanced
the rate of organophosphate ester hydrolysis by up to 5 orders of
magnitude. Recently, Mll7664 from Mesorhizobium loti was identified as a phosphotriesterase-like
metal-carboxylate esterase. This protein
was apparently transformed into a phosphodiesterase by the single
mutation of the bridging glutamate residue of this enzyme to a lysine
(E183K). However, we were unable to transform Rs3690 into a phosphodiesterase
with the same mutation.

Structural Comparison of Lmo2620, Dr0930,
and Rsp3690
Lmo2620 from L. monocytogenes was recently shown
to efficiently hydrolyze d-lyxono-1,4-lactone-5-phosphate, while Dr0930 efficiently hydrolyzes δ-
and γ-lactones. Those residues that
constitute the active sites of these enzymes and Rsp3690 are presented
in Figure . In the structure of Lmo2620 (Figure A) two orthophosphate molecules are bound within
the active site. The proximal phosphate bridges the
two divalent cations and displaces the hydroxide that usually coordinates
the two metal ions. The distal phosphate is ∼7.1
Å from the proximal phosphate and forms polar
interactions with Lys-242, Lys-244, Arg-275, and Tyr-278. A computational
model for the binding of the substrate to the active site of Lmo2620
is consistent with the phosphate moiety of the substrate binding to
the site occupied by the distal phosphate. The hydroxyl groups attached to C-2 and C-3
likely interact with Lys-97 and Tyr-71. In the active site of Dr0930
the long hydrophobic tail of the best γ-lactones will interact
with those residues that are positionally equivalent to those that
interact with the distal phosphate in Lmo2620 (Figure C). These residues include the hydrophobic side chains of
Leu-231, Met-234, Trp-269, and Trp-287. The best substrates for these
three enzymes are shown in Scheme .

Predictions of Function
for Unannotated Members of cog1735
The active site of Rsp3690
is presented in Figure B. The four residues
that interact with the distal phosphate in Lmo2620
are replaced by the hydrophobic residues Met-264,
Phe-266, Val-305 and Met-308. These residues create a hydrophobic
environment within the active site of Rsp3690 and this may help to
explain why Rsp3690 efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of 2-naphthyl
acetate and a variety of other substrates with a hydrophobic structural
scaffold. The residues that help to dictate substrate specificity
in selected groups of cog1735 are highlighted in blue in Figure . From these comparisons we can predict that Pmi1525
will likely catalyze the hydrolysis of hydrophobic carboxylate esters
similar to the substrate specificities of Dr0930 and Rsp3690. However,
the substrate specificity of the PTE homology protein (b3379) will
likely include compounds that contain either phosphate or carboxylate
functional groups (similar to Lmo2620) since this enzyme contains
a conserved arginine residue (R246) that aligns with R275 of Lmo2620
and a conserved lysine residue (K213) that aligns with K242 of Lmo2620.
This information is being used to experimentally characterize the
catalytic properties of the PTE homology protein (PHP) and those enzymes
most closely related to Pmi1525.
