Multicellular organisms have
evolved two distinct types of immune responses against foreign invaders:
the faster innate immune system and the delayed adaptive immune system.
Innate immunity forms the first line of defense against invading pathogens
and harmful environmental factors by detecting danger- and pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively) via diverse pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs). Whereas the membrane-anchored Toll-like
receptors represent the classical PRRs, the cytosolic nucleotide-binding
and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, alternatively
named NBD-LRR or CATERPILLER) are essential for the recognition of
cytosolic PAMPs not intercepted by membrane-bound receptors (for reviews,
see refs (−)).

NLR genes encode large
multidomain proteins with a conserved tripartite
domain architecture characterized by (1) C-terminal leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) necessary for ligand binding, (2) a central nucleotide-binding
and oligomerization domain termed the NACHT domain, and (3) an N-terminal
effector domain most commonly in the form of either a pyrin domain
(PYD), a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), or a baculovirus
inhibitor repeat domain (BIR). These effector domains bind downstream
signaling molecules, ultimately leading to activation of various protein
kinases, transcription factors, proteases, and other components of
host defense and inflammatory responses.−

NLRs are divided
into three subfamilies according to the identity
of their N-terminal effector domains. NLRs containing a PYD (NLRPs)
form the largest subfamily, with 14 members in total (NLRP1–NLRP14)
in humans. NLRP1 and NLRP3, the best-characterized
NLRPs, activate the inflammatory immune response by detecting cytosolic
PAMPs via their C-terminal LRR domains. Once active, NLRP1 and NLRP3
oligomerize via their central NACHT domains. Finally, the N-terminal
PYDs recruit the adaptor protein ASC via homotypic PYD–PYD
interactions, resulting in recruitment of pro-caspase 1 molecules
via homotypic CARD–CARD interactions. The ensuing multicomponent signaling platform, termed the inflammasome,
is analogous to the well-studied Apaf-1 apoptosome. Formation of the inflammasome results in the autoproteolytic
activation of caspase 1, which, in turn, cleaves proinflammatory cytokines
such as pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms.,, Polymorphisms in NLRP1 and NLRP3
are associated with susceptibility to chronic inflammatory disorders,
such as Crohn’s disease, Muckle Wells syndrome, and familial
cold autoimmune syndrome, highlighting the importance of these receptors
in innate immunity., A detailed understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying NLR signaling is of great biological
and medical importance, being critical for the more efficient treatment
of these diseases.

Recent reports have identified novel, significantly
divergent functions
for NLRPs, in addition to their already well-established proinflammatory
functions. This is especially true for
NLRP4 (113 kDa; also known as PAN2, Nalp4, or PYPAF4), which is strongly
expressed in several diverse tissues, including placenta, testis,
oocytes, spleen, pancreas, lung, liver, kidney, and thymus.− NLRP4 has recently been reported as a negative regulator of autophagy
and type I interferon signaling, resulting from the interaction of
its NACHT domain with Beclin1 and TBK1, respectively., Furthermore, NLRP4 was identified as an inhibitor of TNF-α-
and IL-1β-mediated NF-κB activation, which is achieved
through an interaction with IKKα. The PYD of NLRP4 is necessary
for this inhibitory effect on NF-κB, underscoring its importance
as a critical regulator of inflammation signaling pathways.,,

Several PYD structures
have been determined recently. These structures
showed a high degree of conservation of their three-dimensional organization
and surface charge distribution. Thus, the molecular basis for the
specificity of their differential interactions remains poorly understood.− Here, we report the crystal structure of human NLRP4 PYD at 2.3
Å resolution, alongside interaction studies with the adaptor
protein ASC, and provide novel insights into the complexity of PYD
interactions and the factors dictating their specificity.

Experimental Procedures
Protein Expression and Purification
The coding region
of NLRP4 PYD (residues Met1–Leu110) was amplified via polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) using human NLRP4 cDNA (GenBank entry BC050326) as
a DNA template and cloned into the pET28a stop plasmid (Invitrogen),
with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage
site. Escherichia coli BL21 Star(DE3) (Invitrogen)
cells were transformed with the sequence-verified NLRP4 PYD plasmid
(Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany) and grown in 600 mL of LB
medium to an OD600 of 0.8, at which point protein expression
was induced with 420 μM IPTG at 25 °C for 5 h. Harvested
cells were resuspended in lysis buffer I [50 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.8), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, and 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme]
and stored at −20 °C until they were lysed by sonication.
The lysate containing His6-tagged NLRP4 PYD was clarified
by centrifugation and loaded on 800 μL of pre-equilibrated Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography.
The beads were washed with 15 mL of wash buffer I [20 mM Tris (pH
8.0), 1 M NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole], followed by 15 mL of wash buffer
II [20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 M NaCl, and 40 mM imidazole]. NLRP4 was
eluted by thrombin digestion (Sigma Aldrich). The untagged NLRP4 PYD
was further purified using a Superdex 75 10/300 size exclusion column
(SEC) (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in size exclusion buffer I [20
mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM TCEP]. The SEC column was
calibrated using the Gel Filtration Calibration Kit (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol to detect the oligomerization
state of the NLRP4 PYD. Fractions containing the NLRP4 PYD were combined
and concentrated by evaporation to 1.5 mg/mL. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled
protein was expressed in minimal medium (Molecular Dimensions) and
purified under identical conditions. The 15N-labeled NLRP4
PYD was expressed in M9 minimal medium containing 4 g/L [12C]-d-glucose and 1 g/L 15NH4Cl (Cambridge
Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) as the sole carbon and nitrogen
sources, respectively, and purified under identical conditions. Prior
to NMR experiments, the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD was exchanged
into NMR buffer [20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, and
0.5 mM TCEP].

The L25A solubility-enhancing mutation in the
ASC PYD was introduced via overlap extension mutagenesis, and the
His6-tagged L25A ASC PYD (residues 1–94) was expressed
and purified as previously described for the wild-type ASC PYD. To attach a GB1 solubility tag, the L25A ASC
PYD (hereafter termed ASC PYD) sequence was amplified via PCR and
subcloned into the pETRP1B-GB1 bacterial expression vector (in-house),
which encodes an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a TEV
(tobacco etch virus) protease cleavage site and a noncleavable GB1
solubility tag that is separated from the ASC PYD by a four-amino
acid linker (AAEF). For large-scale expression of the GB1-ASC L25A
PYD (hereafter termed GB1-ASC PYD), the sequence-verified (Beckman
Genomics) GB1-ASC PYD construct was transformed into BL21-CodonPlus
(DE3)-RIL cells (Agilent), and 1 L cultures were grown in LB medium
to an OD600 of 0.7. Cultures were chilled at 4 °C
for 1 h, and protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 18
h with vigorous shaking (250 rpm) at 18 °C. Cell pellets were
harvested (6000g for 15 min at 4 °C), and cell
paste was stored at −80 °C. The 15N-labeled
ASC PYD and GB1-ASC PYD were expressed as described for the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD. The GB1-ASC PYD (15N-labeled and
unlabeled) was purified as follows. The cell pellet was thawed and
resuspended in lysis buffer II [50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl,
5 mM imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor
tablets (Roche)] and lysed using high-pressure cell homogenization
(Avestin C3 Emulsiflex). The clarified cell lysate (35000g for 50 min at 4 °C) was loaded onto a HisTrap HP column (GE
Healthcare) equilibrated with His-tag buffer A [50 mM Tris (pH 8.0),
500 mM NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole], and the protein was eluted with
a 5 to 500 mM imidazole gradient over 60 min. Fractions containing
the His6-tagged GB1-ASC PYD, as determined by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE),
were pooled; His6-tagged TEV was added for His6 tag cleavage, and dialysis was conducted simultaneously against
TEV cleavage buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 8) and 500 mM NaCl] at 4 °C
for 16 h. His6 tag cleavage was verified by SDS–PAGE,
and His6-tagged TEV, the cleaved His6 tag, and
any residual uncleaved GB1-ASC PYD were removed via a subtraction
purification step over a gravity flow Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen).
The cleaved GB1-ASC PYD was further purified by size exclusion chromatography
using a Superdex 75 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in NMR
buffer. The purified protein was concentrated to 100 μM using
centrifugal ultrafiltration (Amicon), flash-frozen, and stored at
−80 °C.

Crystallization and Data Collection
Native and SeMet
crystals were grown at 20 °C using vapor diffusion in sitting
drops containing equal volumes of protein solution (1.0 μL of
the purified NLRP4 PYD at 1.5 mg/mL in concentrated size exclusion
buffer I) and precipitant solution (0.1 μL of 0.2 M disodium
tartrate and 2.2 M ammonium sulfate). Crystals formed after 4 days
and were harvested, cryoprotected in paraffin oil, flash-frozen, and
stored in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at beamline
BL14.1 at electron storage ring BESSY II (Berlin-Adlershof, Germany)
operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) and processed using XDS. One
SeMet and one native crystal were used to determine the structure.

Phasing and Refinement
Data were phased in SHELX, using 10 sites to 3.5 Å from the SeMet data set, which yielded
an interpretable electron density map. The model was refined against
the 2.3 Å native data set. Iterative cycles of refinement and
model building were conducted in Coot and Phenix. The final model was refined
to R and Rfree values
of 0.207 and 0.246, respectively, at 2.28 Å resolution (Rfree was calculated using 5% of the reflections
randomly omitted from the refinement). Data collection, model, and
refinement statistics are summarized in Table .

NMR Spectroscopy
The interaction between the NLRP4
PYD (residues 1–110) and the ASC PYD (residues 1–94)
was tested by NMR titration experiments. Two-dimensional (2D) 1H–15N HSQC spectra of the [15N]NLRP4 PYD were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer
equipped with a TCI HCN z-gradient cryoprobe and
processed with Topspin 2.1 (Bruker). Data were analyzed using Cara
(http://cara.nmr.ch); 10% D2O was added to all
samples. A reference 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum
of the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD was recorded at a concentration
of 50 μM in NMR buffer. Titration experiments were performed
with a 2- or 3-fold molar excess of the unlabeled GB1-ASC L25A PYD
in NMR buffer (25 μM [15N]NLRP4 PYD with 50 μM
GB1-ASC-PYD or 16 μM [15N]NLRP4 PYD with 48 μM
GB1-ASC PYD, respectively).

Bioinformatics Analysis
The sequence alignment of the
NLRP4 PYD with the PYDs of NLRP1, -3, -7, and -12, ASC2, ASC was generated
in Multalin, and secondary structure
comparison was completed using the on-line servers Dali and TopMatch-web.− Protein–protein
interactions between the two monomers making up the asymmetric unit
were evaluated using ProtorP. Structure
visualization and analysis were performed in Pymol. Electrostatic surface potentials were calculated using
APBS as part of the PIPSA (Protein Interaction
Property Similarity Analysis) server to
generate quantitative comparisons between PYD electrostatic surface
potentials.

Co-Immunoprecipitation
HEK293FT cells were seeded at
60% confluency in six-well tissue culture plates (Greiner). The following
day, cells were cotransfected with 2 μg of plasmids encoding
full-length Myc-tagged ASC and one of three truncated Flag-tagged
NLRP4 constructs [NLRP4 PYD (residues 1–110), NLRP4 PYD+Linker
(residues 1–162), and NLRP4 ΔLRR (residues 1–324)]
using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The Flag-tagged Aim2 PYD (residues 1–96) was cotransfected
as a positive control. On the day following transfection, cells were
harvested and lysed in 200 μL of IP lysis buffer [50 mM Tris
(pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40] supplemented with protease
inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich). After centrifugation, the clarified lysate
from each sample was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation at
4 °C with anti-Myc antibodies (AbD SeroTec) immobilized on G-Sepharose
(Invitrogen). The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed four times
with IP lysis buffer and, along with a 5% total cell extract control,
resolved via 12% SDS–PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Whatman), and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Myc (AbD SeroTec)
or anti-Flag (Sigma) primary antibodies and AP-labeled secondary antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphate (BCIP) (Roche) were used to augment the signal for protein
detection.

Yeast Two-Hybrid Analysis
The two-hybrid experiments
were performed with MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (Clonetech)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. In summary, the
NLRP4 PYD, NLRP4 PYD+Linker, and ASC PYD were each inserted into the
pGBKT7 and pGADT7 fusion vectors encoding a reporter GAL-4 DNA-binding
domain (BD) and an activation domain (AD), respectively, whose proximity
is necessary for producing a signal. Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain Y2HGold (Clonetech) was cotransformed with either
the pGADT7-NLRP4 PYD (bait protein) or the pGADT7-NLRP4 PYD+Linker
and the pGBKT7-ASC PYD (library protein) or the pGADT7-ASC PYD (bait
protein) and the pGBKT7-NLRP4 PYD or the pGBKT7-NLRP4 PYD+Linker (library
protein) using a small-scale lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier
DNA/polyethylene glycol (LiAc/ss-DNA/PEG) transformation protocol. Transformed yeast cells were resuspended in
sterile water and spotted onto SD/-Leu/-Trp dropout medium to assess
transformation efficiency and onto SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp selection
medium to test for potential interactions. Plates were incubated for
4–5 days at 30 °C. To rule out self-activation of reporter
genes, all fusion constructs were tested for their ability to activate
transcription of the GAL-4 reporter or to associate with either the
GAL-4 BD or GAL-4 AD. Cotransformation of the pGBKT7-ASC PYD and pGADT7-Aim2
PYD (residues 1–96) served as a positive interaction control.

Results
Bioinformatics Analysis of the NLRP4 PYD
The human
genome contains 14 NLRP proteins {NLRP1–NLRP14 [HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee (HGNC, http://www.genenames.org)]}. Structural
information is available for the PYDs of human NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP7,
NLRP12, ASC, ASC2 and murine NLRP10 (PDB entry 2DO9).−, A sequence homology
search using the FFAS server shows a
high degree of conservation between NLRPs, with the highest level
of sequence identity (50%) observed between the NLRP4 PYD and the
NLRP14 PYD (NCBI entry NP_789792.1). In addition, the sequence
of the NLRP4 PYD is 40% identical with that of the NLRP12 PYD (PDB
entry 2L6A), 34% identical with that of the NLRP3 PYD (PDB
entry 3QF2), 33% identical with that of the NLRP1 PYD (PDB
entry 1PN5), and 33% identical with that of the NLRP7 PYD
(PDB entry 2KM6) (Table ).
Furthermore, the sequence of NLRP4 PYD is 22% identical with that
of the adaptor protein ASC PYD (PDB entry 1UCP) and 23%
identical with that of ASC2 (also known as POP1) (PDB entry 2HM2), the dominant-negative modulator of ASC.

The NLRP4 PYD is a Monomer in Solution
The NLRP4 PYD
(residues Met1–Leu110) was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. As verified by size exclusion chromatography,
the NLRP4 PYD exists as a monomer in solution (Figure S1A of the ). To further characterize
NLRP4 PYD multimerization in solution, we placed the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD in a weakly reducing buffer (0.5 mM TCEP; the
NLRP4 PYD has one cysteine, Cys85), waited several days to allow for
any dimerization to occur, and recorded a 2D 1H–15N HSQC NMR spectrum. The outstanding quality of the spectrum
(Figure S1B of the ) is typical for a small 13.9 kDa protein, indicating that the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD exists as a monomer after several days
under weakly reducing conditions.

The NLRP4 PYD in NMR buffer
cannot be concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore),
as it readily precipitates. This phenomenon has been observed in other
NLR effector domains [NLRP1 and NLRC5
(unpublished data)] and seems to be a common feature of this protein
subfamily. We found concentration by evaporation, which increases
the concentration of all sample components (i.e., protein, salt, and
TCEP), to be more efficient, allowing the NLRP4 PYD to reach a concentration
of 3 mg/mL. Crystallization was conducted using the sitting drop vapor
diffusion method. Crystals appeared within 4 days, diffracted to 2.3
Å, and were indexed in space group P3221, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Because of heavy twinning
(45%) (phenix.xtriage), it was impossible
to determine the structure using the initial SeMet data sets. However,
several rounds of crystallization optimization combined with diffraction
screening of 50 SeMet and 15 native crystals allowed one SeMet and
one native crystal with &lt;3% twinning to be identified that yielded
quality data suitable for structure determination.

Crystal Structure of the NLRP4 PYD
The final model
includes two NLRP4 PYD monomers (residues Phe5–Tyr95 in chain
A and Phe5–Gly94 in chain B), one sulfate ion, two chloride
ions, and 40 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. No electron density
was observed for the N- and C-termini (residues Met1–Ser4 and
Thr96–Leu110 in chain A and Met1–Ser4 and Tyr95–Leu110
in chain B). The Matthews coefficient (Vm) for the NLRP4 PYD is 2.50 Å3/Da, and the estimated
solvent content is 51%. The Ramachandran plot shows that 99.4% of
the residues are in the allowed regions.

The crystal structure
of the NLRP4 PYD adopts a typical death domain fold (Figure ). Six α-helices (α1−α6)
are tightly packed around a central hydrophobic core [formed by Leu11,
Tyr14, Leu15, Leu18, Phe23, Phe26, Leu30, Leu55, Leu59, Trp69, Ile71,
Leu73, Ile75, Phe76, Met79, Leu84, and Val88 (Figure A,C,D)] and form an antiparallel α-helical bundle. This
well-defined hydrophobic core, which defines the death domain fold,
is conserved throughout the entire DD superfamily., The six ordered α-helices of the NLRP4 PYD are connected by
loops ranging from one to five amino acids in length (Figure B,C). The loops connecting helices α1 (Gly10–Glu16)
to α2 (Lys20–Gln36), α3 (Trp44–Lys49) to
α4 (Arg52–Tyr63), and α5 (Glu65–Lys78) to
α6 (Lys82–Thr93) are each three amino acids in length,
while the α2−α3 loop is composed of five amino
acids that are disordered. Helices α4 and α5 are linked
by only a single residue, Glu64, making this linker structurally constrained,
which accounts for its outlier position in the Ramachandran plot.

Homodimeric Interface in the NLRP4 PYD Crystallographic Dimer
Two NLRP4 PYD monomers (chains A and B) form a dimer in the asymmetric
unit, which are related by a pseudo-2-fold axis at the dimerization
interface. The interface buries 2252 Å2 of solvent-accessible
surface area (SASA), which corresponds to a 17.83% burial of the SASA
of each monomer and is thus in the range
of biologically relevant protein–protein interfaces. The NLRP4
dimer interface is comprised of both electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions. Contacts are formed by the side chains of Phe9_A (chain
A) with Leu73_B (chain B), Ile60_A with Ile60_B, Gln66_A with the
main chain of Phe9_B, and Lys87_A with the main chain of Glu91_B (Figure
S2 of the ). Because
of the pseudo-2-fold axis, the reverse interactions (i.e., Phe9_B
with Leu73_A, etc.) are also present.

While a dimer was observed
in the crystal, SEC and NMR data show that the NLRP4 PYD is monomeric
in solution. Interestingly, a similar behavior has been observed for
the CARD of NLRC1 (also termed CARD1 or Nod1). Specifically, two NMR structures clearly show that the
NLRC1 CARD forms a monomer in solution (ref () and PDB entry 2DBD), while two crystal structures,, show that the NLRC1 CARD forms
disulfide-linked dimers. Interestingly, NLRP4 PYD dimerization does
not appear to be a result of a disulfide bond between Cys85 residues
from each monomer, as Cys85 in each monomer is distal from the dimerization
interface, with the corresponding sulfur atoms more than 26 Å
apart. Taken together, our data and other available PYD and CARD data
suggest that dimer formation (either via disulfide bonds or, in our
case, via other protein–protein interactions) is likely induced
by crystal packing.

However, PYD or CARD dimerization may still
be necessary for some
aspects of PYD or CARD function. Homotypic interactions between PYDs
(in the case of inflammasomes) and CARDs (in apoptosomes and some
inflammasomes) are complex, and even dynamic in nature. The ability
of PYDs and CARDs to easily make the transition between the monomeric
and dimeric states might be important for their function, such as
stabilization of the inflammasome and apoptosome signaling platforms,
respectively, thereby improving the efficacy of downstream signaling. It should be noted that Cys85 in helix α6
of the NLRP4 PYD is conserved in NLRP1, -7, -8, -11, -13, and -14,
and although no cysteine mutation with a discernible phenotype has
been reported so far, future studies are necessary to investigate
the physiological relevance, if any, of disulfide-linked PYDs.

Variation among NLR PYDs
The death domain superfamily,
which includes the death domain (DD), the death effector domain (DED),
the CARD, and the PYD subfamilies, is characterized by six antiparallel
α-helices packed in a Greek key topology. Recently, we used the structures of the PYDs of NLRP7 and
-12 to identify the key conserved residues necessary for forming the
conserved hydrophobic core of DD family members. On the basis of the aforementioned structural comparisons,
we expected the hydrophobic core of the NLRP4 PYD to be formed by
Leu11, Tyr14, Leu15, Leu18, Phe23, Phe26, Leu30, Leu55, Leu59, Trp69,
Ile71, Leu73, Phe76, Met79, and Leu84, which are in perfect agreement
with the core residues seen in our crystal structure (residues highlighted
in yellow in Figure A,D).

The NLRP4 PYD was superimposed onto the structures
of several PYDs using the TopMatch-web server− (Figure ), which revealed high levels of structural similarity
between all analyzed PYDs [pairwise rmsds of ∼1.8 Å (Table )]. However, the NLRP4 PYD and NLRP1 PYD showed
relatively subtle but significant differences from the NLRP7 PYD.
Namely, both the NLRP4 PYD and the NLRP1 PYD possess the shortest
α1 helix as well as the longest α2 and α6 helices
(Figures B and A).
Given the high degree of conservation of tertiary and secondary structural
elements of PYDs, their evolutionary relationship was investigated
using TraceSuite II. The phylogenetic
tree is shown in Figure S3 of the  and assigns two large branches. One branch consists of the adaptor
ASC and its inhibitor ASC2, while the second branch groups the receptor
PYDs of NLRP1, -3, -4, -7, and -12.

Structural comparison of the NLRP4 PYD
with the PYDs of NLRP7 and
NLRP1. (A) Superposition of the NLRP4 PYD (blue) on the NLRP7 PYD
(cyan) and the NLRP1 PYD (green). (B) Residues that stabilize helix
α3 in the NLRP4 PYD and the NLRP7 PYD are labeled and shown
as yellow sticks. Corresponding hydrophobic residues are missing in
the NLRP1 PYD. (C) Trp44 in the NLRP4 PYD is structurally conserved
in the NLRP7 PYD.

The most striking difference seen in the NLRP4
PYD, when compared
to NLRP1 and NLRP7 PYDs, is the length of helix α3 and the α2−α3
connecting loop (Figure A,B). In the NLRP4
PYD, helix α3 is composed of two turns and is stabilized by
Leu37, Leu39, and Ile42 from the α2−α3 connecting
loop, Trp44 and Val47 from helix α3, Ala50 from the α3−α4
connecting loop, and Leu58 and Tyr63 form helix α4 (Figures A,B and B). This hydrophobic
cluster, which is centered on helix α3 and the α2−α3
connecting loop, is conserved in NLRP3, NLRP7, and ASC PYDs and, to
a lesser extent, in the NLRP12 PYD and ASC2 (where helix α3
is only a single turn helix). In contrast, the NLRP1 PYD completely
lacks hydrophobic residues in helix α3 and the α2−α3
connecting loop that are required for stabilization of these structural
elements. Instead, the NLRP1 PYD forms a long unstructured linker
between helices α2 and α4. Lastly, residue Trp44 of the NLRP4 PYD is structurally conserved
in NLRP7 and NLRP12 PYDs. Both Trp43 (NLRP7 PYD) and Trp44 (NLRP4
PYD) form a hydrophobic stacking interaction that stabilizes helix
α3 (Figure C). In contrast, Trp45 of
the NLRP12 PYD is surface-exposed and mediates a protein–protein
interaction with the FAF-1 UBA domain.

The difference in helix α3 between the various PYD structures
is important, as it has been suggested that a disordered helix α3
that becomes fully folded only upon binding to downstream partners
is a common feature in PYDs and thus was considered to have a crucial
role in the protein–protein interactions required for inflammasome
signaling.,, In fact, this
highly variable region, along with the variable α2−α3
connecting loop, was shown to play a key role in guiding homotypic
as well as heterotypic PYD binding interactions., While it is extremely likely that all other PYDs with unknown structures
contain the well-established hydrophobic core formed by helices α1,
α2, and α4−α6, we can also expect to see
increasing diversity in the conformations of helix α3 and the
α2−α3 connecting loop, like those seen in the NLRP4
PYD, as more PYD structures are determined.

Comparison of the PYD Family Reveals Distinct Electrostatic
Surfaces
It has been well established that oppositely charged
electrostatic surface potentials (ESPs) have a vital role in the formation
of homotypic death domain interactions. Recently reported structures
of the PIDDosome, the FAS–FADD complex, and the Apaf-1–Caspase-9
complex highlighted the importance of charged surfaces in homotypic
DD and CARD interactions.− A similar electrostatic interaction
mechanism was described for the homotypic PYD interaction between
the ASC PYD and ASC2. Specifically, a large positively charged surface
on ASC2 (formed by Lys21, Lys22, Lys24, Lys26, Arg38 and Arg41 from
helices α2 and α3) interacts with a complementary negatively
charged surface on the ASC PYD [formed by residues Asp6, Asp10, Glu13,
Asp48, Asp51, and Asp54 from helices α1 and α4 (residues
highlighted in blue and red in Figures A and )].

Electrostatic surface
potentials of the NLRP4 PYD compared to ASC2
and the PYDs of ASC and NLRP1. The electrostatic potentials (ESPs)
of the two interaction surfaces formed by helices α2 and α3
and helices α1 and α4 are mapped on the solvent-accessible
surface of the identically oriented PYDs from NLRP4, NLRP1, ASC, and
ASC2. The color scale varies from red (negative ESP) to blue (positive
ESP). Residues responsible for these charges are labeled on each structure.
Arrows indicate previously experimentally detected direct homtoypic
PYD interactions.

Thus, we analyzed the ESP of the NLRP4 PYD, which
showed that the
NLRP4 PYD also possesses two distinctly charged surfaces. The NLRP4
PYD has a prominent positively charged region spanning helices α2
and α3, as well as a weaker negatively charged surface consisting
of Asp8 and Glu16 from helix α1 and Glu53 and Glu54 from helix
α4, which is especially similar to ASC2. Figure  illustrates the electrostatic surfaces of the NLRP4 PYD and
the PYDs of NLRP1, ASC, and ASC2. Electrostatic similarity calculations
performed by the PIPSA server showed
that the NLRP4 PYD is most similar to ASC2 (electrostatic distance
of 1.02; a distance of 0 indicates the electrostatic surface potentials
are identical, while a score of 2 indicates they are completely opposite)
followed by the ASC PYD (electrostatic distance of 1.12), NLRP3 PYD
(electrostatic distance of 1.44), NLRP12 PYD (electrostatic distance
of 1.52), NLRP1 PYD (electrostatic distance of 1.60), and NLRP7 PYD
(electrostatic distance of 1.64).

The significant electrostatic
similarity of NLRP4 and ASC2 is based
on a highly positively charged ESP encompassing Lys20, Arg24, Lys25,
Lys27, and Lys31 on helix α2 and Lys48 and Lys49 on helix α3
(Figure ). Currently, no other NLRP PYD has
been shown to possess a similarly extensive positively charged surface.
In other NLRP PYD structures, this surface is either mostly negatively
charged (NLRP1 PYD), slightly positively charged with a prominent
hydrophobic patch (NLRP12 PYD), or slightly negatively charged with
a significant hydrophobic patch (NLRP7 and NLRP3 PYDs).

The
inflammasome receptors NLRP1 and NLRP3 were shown to interact
with ASC, leading to the formation of the inflammasome signaling platform.,,, Interestingly, the ESPs of NLRP1 and NLRP3 are different, highlighting
that the electrostatic nature of these protein–protein interactions
might have been overemphasized. Specifically, the NLRP3 PYD is mainly
negatively charged and thus was proposed to interact with the positively
charged surface of the ASC PYD, while not competing with ASC2 for
the negatively charged surface of the ASC PYD. The electrostatic surface of the NLRP1 PYD also differs
from those of the NLRP3 PYD and ASC2. Taken together, this indicates
that homotypic PYD–PYD interactions, which were previously
thought to be due to the attraction between oppositely charged surfaces,
are likely more complex. This is further confirmed by our observation
that both the NLRP7 PYD and the NLRP12 PYD have negatively charged
surfaces that are comparable to that of NLRP3, but unlike NLRP3, they
are unable to interact with ASC.,

The NLRP4 PYD Does Not Interact Directly with the ASC PYD
Interestingly, the NLRP4 PYD has a positively charged surface that
is very similar to that of ASC2. In ASC2, this positively charged
surface is responsible for its interaction with the ASC PYD (Figure ). Furthermore, NLRP4
was shown to form heterotypic oligomers with the inflammasome-forming
receptors NLRP3 and NLRC4 via NACHT domain interactions., This raises the question of whether the NLRP4 PYD also interacts
with the ASC PYD, thus leading to caspase 1 and IL-1β activation.

On the basis of these observations, we tested for an interaction
between the NLRP4 PYD and the ASC PYD via NMR chemical shift perturbation
(CSP) analysis. Specifically, we recorded a 2D heteronuclear 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD and then added the unlabeled ASC PYD in a 2-
and 3-fold molar excess to the 15N-labeled NLRP4 PYD sample
(the limited solubility of these proteins did not allow for higher
ratios to be tested; throughout this work, the solubility-enhancing
L25A mutant of the ASC PYD was used for all NMR measurements). No
CSPs were detected, indicating that there is no direct interaction
between the PYDs of NLRP4 and ASC (Figure S4 of the ). It should be noted that NMR titration
experiments were conducted at pH 7.2 such that the environment more
closely resembled that of the cell, as previous reports indicated
that death domain interactions are affected by low pH (previous in vitro interaction experiments using the ASC
PYD were conducted at pH 4.5, due to the insolubility of the ASC PYD
at physiological pH). As the recombinant ASC PYD is expressed insolubly
in bacterial cells, purification requires denaturation of inclusion
bodies and protein refolding. Using a GB1 solubility tag, we succeeded
in expressing and purifying the soluble, monomeric ASC PYD (confirmed
by SEC). The increased solubility and stability of the GB1-tagged
construct allowed for the acquisition of NMR data at physiological
pH. GB1 is a widely used solubility-enhancing tag for NMR studies
that has been successfully used for structural and interaction studies
of ∼30 proteins that represent a broad variety of structural
topologies and biological functions. The
N-terminal GB1 tag is joined to the ASC PYD via a four-amino acid
linker, which is sufficiently long (∼12 Å) so as not to
affect the three-dimensional structure of the ASC PYD. To confirm
this, we superimposed the 2D 1H–15N HSQC
spectra of the untagged and GB1-tagged 15N-labeled ASC
PYD (acquired under identical buffer conditions). Figure S5 of the  shows that both spectra
overlap very well, confirming that the GB1-tagged ASC PYD adopts a
structure nearly identical to that of the untagged ASC PYD. Only a
small number of minor differences in the chemical shifts of GB1-tagged
and untagged ASC PYDs are observed for residues in helix α1,
which is closest to the N-terminal GB1 tag, and for a few residues
in helices α4 and α5, likely the result of side chain
interactions with the nearby helix α1. Importantly, the α2−α3
surface and helix α6 of the ASC PYD are unaffected by the presence
of the GB1 tag. In summary, we developed a new approach that uses
the GB1-ASC PYD to test homo- and heterotypic PYD interactions at
physiological pH and used it to show that there is no interaction
between the NLRP4 PYD and the ASC PYD.

We also tested for an
interaction between NLRP4 and the ASC PYD
using cellular assays. First, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed
in HEK 293FT cells with Myc-tagged ASC and several truncated Flag-tagged
NLRP4 constructs (Figure S6A of the ). Because the ligand for NLRP4 activation is unknown,
truncated constructs including the NLRP4 ΔLRR (NLRP4 lacking
the LRR domain), NLRP4 PYD+Linker, and NLRP4 PYD were used to avoid
a misleading result from an autoinhibited receptor that is unable
to bind the downstream signaling partner. However, in agreement with
the NMR studies, we were not able to detect an interaction between
NLRP4 and ASC by co-immunoprecipitation (Figure S6A of the ). The previously reported
Aim2 PYD–ASC PYD interaction was used as a positive control.
Lastly, we performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis of the NLRP4 PYD
and NLRP4 PYD+Linker with the ASC PYD, which again confirmed the NMR
and co-immunoprecipitation results (Figure S6B of the ).

Thus, although the NLRP4 PYD has distinct and oppositely charged
surface patches that were originally thought to be necessary for homotypic
PYD interactions, we were not able to detect a direct interaction
between the NLRP4 PYD and the ASC PYD. These findings
are in agreement with the observation that NLRP4 has no effect on
IL-1β activation,, and show that other factors must play a vital role in forming these
interactions. Furthermore, they are in line with the previously reported
importance of hydrophobic residues in CARD–CARD homotypic interactions as well as a PYD heterotypic interaction recently
reported between the NLRP12 PYD and FAF-1.

Discussion
PYDs are the most abundant members of the
DD superfamily, and it
has become apparent that they have an essential role in the control
of signaling in immune and apoptotic pathways., During
the past 5 years, numerous PYD structures have been reported, which
have resulted in detailed analyses of both the structural and, in
the case of NMR structures, dynamic parameters that control PYD activity
and specificity.−, While the structural and dynamics
differences between PYDs are more numerous than the similarities,
work on the signaling adaptor protein ASC and its inhibitor ASC2 showed
the importance of electrostatic complementarity between PYD domains
for their interactions., Similar results were
reported for CARD–CARD and DD–DD interactions.,,

Here, we report the three-dimensional
crystal structure of the
NLRP4 PYD at 2.3 Å resolution. The NLRP4 PYD adopts a typical
DD fold with six α-helices that are arranged in an antiparallel
helical bundle around a highly conserved hydrophobic core. This hydrophobic
core was previously established on the basis of our work on multiple
NLRP PYD domains., Hydrophobic residues also play
a decisive role in stabilizing the conformation of helix α3
and the α2−α3 connecting loop relative to the rest
of the domain, as readily seen in the structures of the PYDs from
NLRP3, NLRP7, NLRP12, and now NLRP4. The only outlier is the NLRP1
PYD, in which helix α3 does not exist and the α2−α3
connecting loop is exceedingly dynamic, as probed by fast time scale
autocorrelated relaxation measurements. This is important, as the surface formed by helix α3 and the
α2−α3 connecting loop has been identified as an
important protein–protein interaction site for PYDs, and thus,
differences in this region are likely the driving force for differential
binding and selectivity among PYDs.

Interestingly, in the NLRP4
PYD, the surface electrostatics of
helix α3 and the α2−α3 loop region are highly
similar to those of the ASC PYD and ASC2. A model of the ASC PYD–ASC2
complex showed that the positive ESP of ASC2 interacts with the negative
ESP of the ASC PYD. Thus, we tested for
an interaction between the NLRP4 PYD and the ASC PYD using a variety
of in vitro and in vivo tools. Significantly, to perform in vitro
studies with the ASC PYD under biologically relevant conditions, it
was necessary to develop a novel construct of the ASC PYD that was
stable at physiological pH. This is because, until this work, the
heterologously expressed ASC PYD had only been isolated and refolded
from inclusion bodies and was only stable at acidic pH values. By
fusing the ASC PYD to GB1, a small highly soluble protein domain,
we were able to express soluble ASC PYD that, once purified, is stable
at physiological pH (i.e., 7.2). This is critical, as previous reports
showed that homotypic PYD–PYD interactions are very sensitive
to pH, with optimal interaction conditions occurring at physiological
pH. Thus, the GB1-ASC PYD construct is
an exciting new tool for research in the NLRP field.

Interestingly,
using both in vitro CSP measurements and in vivo
pull-down studies, we were not able to detect a direct interaction
between the NLRP4 PYD and ASC PYD. Overlap of the three-dimensional
structure of the NLRP4 PYD, the ASC PYD, and ASC2 allows for structural
comparisons of the Arg and Lys residues that are responsible for the
formation of the positively charged surface. Notably, the NLRP4 PYD
has a novel second positively charged surface, which is formed by
residues Arg74 and Lys78 on helix α5 and Lys82 on helix α6
(Figure ). This is interesting,
as the α5−α6
loop and helix α6 are proposed to engage in homotypic type II
interactions that occur within large signaling platforms, as was described
for the homotypic DD interaction within the PIDDosome.,,

NLRP4 PYD showing an additional positive
patch. The electrostatic
potentials of helices α5 and α6 are mapped onto the solvent-accessible
surface of the NLRP4 PYD. Residues Arg74, Lys78, and Lys82, form this
positively charged surface.

Our structure of the NLRP4 PYD, especially in the
context of the
PYD family, further illustrates that the electrostatic surface distribution
varies widely among PYDs. Thus, it is increasingly apparent that individual
PYDs most likely have distinct interaction partners., Furthermore, we have also shown that NLRP4 differs from ASC-binding
PYDs in several important aspects and thus likely functions in an
ASC-independent manner. Our structural analysis and CSP experiments
also show that electrostatic interactions might not be as important
as previously assumed for death domain fold protein interactions.
In agreement with our data, previous reports highlighted the importance
of hydrophobic interactions for the homotypic DD. Indeed, as shown
in Figure , the CARD domains of Apaf-1 and
caspase 9 share many structural features with the NLRP4 PYD. This
comparison allowed us to identify hydrophobic residues that are important
for the CARD–CARD interaction between Apaf-1 and caspase 9
within the NLRP4 PYD. Specifically, Ile30 in the Apaf-1 CARD is located
at the last turn of helix α2, which structurally aligns with
Leu35 in the NLRP4 PYD (Figure A). Furthermore,
Ile60 in caspase 9 structurally aligns with Ile60 in the NLRP4 PYD
which is, however, shifted by one turn in helix α4 (Figure B).

Comparison of the NLRP4 PYD with the Apaf-1 CARD and the
caspase
9 CARD. Residues (yellow sticks) that mediate a hydrophobic interaction
between the Apaf-1 CARD (magenta) and the caspase 9 CARD (cyan) are
also surface-exposed in the NLRP4 PYD (blue).

Taken together, our earlier findings describing
the Pyrin domain
fold and stability, combined with our current work, have significantly
contributed to the characterization of PYDs and their function. The
findings described here suggest that the generally accepted electrostatic
model of PYD–PYD interaction specificity is incomplete and
that additional factors, such as dynamics and hydrophobic interactions,
also likely play an important role in these interactions.
