Although
interaction of a few G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
with Filamin A, a key actin cross-linking and biomechanical signal
transducer protein, has been observed, a comprehensive structure–function
analysis of this interaction is lacking. Through a systematic sequence-based
analysis, we found that a conserved filamin binding motif is present
in the cytoplasmic domains of &gt;20% of the 824 GPCRs encoded in
the
human genome. Direct high-affinity interaction of filamin binding
motif peptides of select GPCRs with the Ig domain of Filamin A was
confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal
titration calorimetric experiments. Engagement of the filamin binding
motif with the Filamin A Ig domain induced the phosphorylation of
filamin by protein kinase A in vitro. In transfected cells, agonist
activation as well as constitutive activation of representative GPCRs
dramatically elicited recruitment and phosphorylation of cellular
Filamin A, a phenomenon long known to be crucial for regulating the
structure and dynamics of the cytoskeleton. Our data suggest a molecular
mechanism for direct GPCR–cytoskeleton coupling via filamin.
Until now, GPCR signaling to the cytoskeleton was predominantly thought
to be indirect, through canonical G protein-mediated signaling cascades
involving GTPases, adenylyl cyclases, phospholipases, ion channels,
and protein kinases. We propose that the GPCR-induced filamin phosphorylation
pathway is a conserved, novel biochemical signaling paradigm.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiate wide-ranging responses,
including integrin-regulated processes such as cell migration, cell
survival, growth, chemotaxis, and the associated cell morphological
changes such as membrane ruffling, formation of filopodia, focal adhesions,
and formation of lamellipodia.1,2 These fundamental changes
in cells are contingent upon engaging cytoskeletal proteins upon activating
the conventional G protein-dependent and -independent signaling mechanisms
involving proteins such as β-arrestin, small GTPases, and PDZ-containing
proteins.3 At a molecular level, cell morphological
changes or cytoskeletal responses to GPCRs are thought to be an indirect
outcome of signaling cascades, and as a consequence, direct binding
and activation of a major cytoskeletal protein by GPCRs are not considered
a mechanism at present. Biophysical and biochemical studies presented
here indicate that a substantial number of GPCRs may directly bind
and activate a major actin cross-linking protein, Filamin A (FLNa),
and that the binding triggers filamin phosphorylation by cellular
protein kinases.

The relationship between GPCRs and cytoskeletal
modulation of cellular
phenotype is widely evident in physiological and pathological paradigms.
Apart from their well-established role as transducers of neuro-endocrine
hormone and sensory signals,4 GPCRs are
expressed at high levels in some breast,5 gynecological,6 neurological,7 and prostate cancers8 and alter invasive properties of tumor cells.9 Indeed, GPCR blockade is currently being explored as a
cancer therapy, and a majority of drugs used in clinical practice
are ligands for GPCRs.9 Antipsychotic drugs
target reorganization of nerve cytoskeletal components, which is critical
for neuronal morphology, plasticity, and the synaptic architecture
in the adult brain, via GPCR antagonism.10 However, definitive mechanisms for direct communication between
GPCRs and the cytoskeleton remain undefined.

Filamin is an actin
binding dimeric cytoskeletal protein with 24
immunoglobulin (Ig) repeats that engages the cytoplasmic regions of
many transmembrane proteins.11,12 A few genetic and biochemical
studies have reported interaction of GPCRs with FLNa. In these studies,
the role of FLNa in augmenting the membrane expression, subcellular
localization, trafficking, and signaling of GPCRs is emphasized. For
example, intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) of D2 and D3 dopamine receptors
was shown to interact with immunoglobulin-like repeat (Ig) 19 of FLNa
to promote proper cell surface expression and signaling.13−15 The C-terminal tail (Ct) of the calcitonin receptor and C–C
chemokine receptor type 2 were shown to interact with FLNa Ig20–21
and Ig21–24, respectively, and play key roles in endocytic
sorting and internalization of the receptor.16,17 Similarly, the interactions of the μ-type opioid receptor
with FLNa Ig24,18−20 the calcium-sensing receptor with FLNa Ig14–15,21−26 metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 7b with FLNa Ig21–22,
and somatostatin receptor type 2 with FLNa Ig19–20 are reported
to play scaffolding and functional roles in GPCR signaling.27−30 Filamin is a key mediator of epithelial defense against intrusion
of transformed cells;31 therefore, GPCR
signal regulation through FLNa is an important unexplored mechanism.

FLNa Ig4, Ig9, Ig12, Ig17, Ig19, Ig21, and Ig23 are class A repeats
that possess a conserved binding site capable of engaging several
proteins such as platelet glycoprotein Ib α (GPIbα), integrins,
and migfilin.32 Recently, these repeats
have been shown to reduce the level of integrin activation when overexpressed
in a platelet integrin model through a two-site binding mechanism.33 Among the class A repeats, Ig21 was shown to
have the highest binding affinity for the filamin ligands.32 Interestingly, Ig21 exists in an autoinhibited
form by engaging the N-terminal portion of the Ig20 repeat as an intramolecular
inhibitory ligand.34 Recruitment of filamin
binding proteins such as integrins and migfilin to filamin relieves
this autoinhibition and promotes structural reorganization of filamin.35 Recently, it has been revealed that disrupting
the Ig21 autoinhibition by FLNa ligands promoted protein kinase A
(PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of the S2152 site36,37 on Ig20. Ligand-dependent S2152 phosphorylation by a variety of
FLNa ligands may be a novel pathway for activating filamin function
in diverse filamin-mediated cellular processes.

Overall, the
current scientific literature suggests the potential
involvement of GPCRs in the engagement of different FLNa Ig repeats
during a variety of biological responses. Nevertheless, the mechanisms
for direct communication between GPCRs and FLNa remain poorly defined
at the molecular level. In this study, we found that &gt;20% of human
GPCRs are endowed with a likely FLNa binding motif (FBM). We demonstrate
high-affinity physical interaction of predicted FBMs for three different
GPCRs with FLNa Ig21: (i) angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a
prototypical agonist-activated GPCR with important roles in cardiovascular
physiology, (ii) proto-oncogene MAS, a constitutively active GPCR
with a cardio-protective role, and (iii) α1D-adrenoreceptor
(α1D-AR), a neuro-hormone GPCR with cardiovascular
roles. As a consequence of high-affinity binding, we demonstrate enhanced
PKA-mediated filamin phosphorylation of Ig16–24 in vitro. We
further determined that GPCRs, AT1R, and MAS directly recruited FLNa
and promoted its phosphorylation by cellular S/T kinases in an agonist-dependent
manner. Our studies thus provide a structural framework for filamin
in GPCR signaling, potentially regulating a variety of cellular responses.

Experimental
Procedures
Peptides and Reagents
The following peptides were synthesized
by the Biotechnology Core at the Lerner Research Institute of the
Cleveland Clinic: (1) D3R, VRKLSNGRLSTSLKLGPLQPRGV;
(2) MAS, KKKRFKESLKVVLTRAFK;
(3) AT1R, LGKKFKRYFLQLLKYIPPKA;
and (4) α1D-AR, KGHTFRSSLSVRLLKFSR.
All peptides were purified via high-performance liquid chromatography
and were &gt;95% pure. Peptide concentrations were estimated using
their
predicted extinction coefficient at A280 using the protein parameters tool on the ExPASY server (http://web.expasy.org/pro/). In cases where the peptide did not have a UV signature, the thoroughly
lyophilized peptide was weighed carefully and an 85% purity was assumed
to estimate concentration.

Human Filamin A (Uniprot entry P21333)
immunoglobulin domains Ig16–24 (1772–2647), Ig19 and
Ig21 were cloned into pGST-parallel vectors and purified as described
previously.32,35 Phospho-Filamin A (S2152, #4761)
and Filamin A (#4762) polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), while the antibody for GAPDH was
obtained from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Filamin A monoclonal
antibody for detecting immunoprecipitated filamin was from Millipore
(MAB1680). Agonist peptide angiotensin II (AngII) for stimulation
was purchased from Bachem, and AT1R antagonist candesartan was a gift
from AstraZeneca. Specific MAS activating and inhibiting ligands AR234960
(AR-agonist) and AR244555 (AR-inverse), respectively, were unrestricted gifts from Arena Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (San Diego, CA). PKA inhibitor H-89 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). MAS ligands and other inhibitors were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide as 10 mM stocks. The pH of the buffer in the experiments
was verified to be neutral (7–7.5) after the ligands had been
added to the desired concentrations of 10–50 μM.

Identifying
the Filamin Class A Repeat Binding Motif (FBM) in
GPCRs
On the basis of the sequence alignment of peptides
from peptide-bound filamin structures [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 2BRQ, 2J3S, 2K9U, 2W0P, 2BP3, 2JF1, and 3ISW], homologous sequences,
and the predicted alignment of peptides from a previous study,38 we rationally defined the FBM as [X–a/R/K]−3-[X′–a/R/K]−2-[Ω/Φ/T]−1-[R/K/Φ/S/F]0-[ζ/E/D]1-X′2-[Ψ/F]3-X′4-[Ψ/R/K/Ω]5-X′6-[Ψ/Φ/Ω/M/R/K/S/P]7-X8, where Ψ = L, V, I, or T, Ω = F,
W, or Y, Φ = A,V, I, or L, ζ = S, T, N, or Q, X represents
any amino acid, X–a represents any amino acid except
acidic residues (D and E), and X′ represents any amino acid
except P. In the FBM, the position (denoted as subscripts) of the
most conserved residue is numbered “0” and usually contains
a basic residue (K or R). In addition, in migfilin and CFTR peptide-bound
filamin structures, we observed that the lack of basic residues at
position 0 (underlined residues) appears to be compensated at position
−2 or −3. The basic residues at these positions appear
to be important for interactions of the peptide with FLNa Ig21, which
has a complementary acidic patch. Therefore, in our search algorithm,
we introduced the following additional conditions for residues at
positions −2 and −3: (1) the presence of K or R is a
must in case they are absent at position 0, and (2) no acidic residue
(D or E) is allowed. Furthermore, at positions −2 through 6,
the residue P was avoided as it is not a preferred residue in a β-strand.
A curated list of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) was downloaded
from the UniProt Knowledgebase.39 All 824
human GPCR sequences in this list were scanned for (i) the FBM without
any mismatches and (ii) a 100% overlap of FBM in the intracellular
halves of transmembrane helices, intracellular loops, and C-terminal
regions as annotated in the downloaded sequence files. The Ig21 structure
from 2J3S is
represented by the electrostatic potential on the surface calculated
using the program APBS40 and contoured
at ±12kT/e.

In Vitro Kinase Assays
The kinase
assay reaction conditions included 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μM FLNaIg16–24 as a substrate, and 10, 50,
or 200 μM filamin binding peptides (to release autoinhibition),
and 500 μM ATP. For each 100 μL reaction, 1000 units of
murine PKA (from NEB) was used. Protein phosphorylation was detected
by Western blotting using the phospho-Filamin A antibody (see Peptides and Reagents).

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) Spectroscopy
15N-labeled proteins Ig19 and
Ig21 were purified,32 and the HSQC spectra
were recorded in a Bruker
Avance 600 MHz spectrometer at 30 °C. Spectral processing and
analysis were conducted using nmrPipe and NMRView.41

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
A MicroCal iTC200
calorimeter from GE Healthcare was used for determining ligand affinities
for FLNa Ig repeats. Purified proteins were extensively buffer exchanged
into 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 5 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. Peptide
ligands were dissolved in the same buffer and estimated as described
earlier; 50 μM protein in the sample cell was titrated against
1 mM peptide in the syringe at 30 °C in 1 μL increments
at a stirring speed of 1000 rpm. The solubility of the α1D-AR peptide was limited, and hence, this peptide was at an
effective concentration of 0.4 mM in the syringe. Affinities were
determined by fitting the heat changes to a one-site binding model
using the associated Origin package.

Expression of FBM-Containing
GPCRs, AT1R, and MAS Constructs
and Cell Culture
The cloning of wild-type (WT) MAS with an
N-terminal myc tag and establishment of tetracycline/doxycycline-inducible
stable cell lines in HEK293 cells were described previously (HEK-MAS).42 These stable cell lines were maintained in a
humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and grown
in complete medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%),
penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/mL), blasticidin (5 μg/mL),
and hygromycin (300 μg/mL). For experiments, the cells were
induced with complete medium containing doxycycline (100 ng/mL) for
26–28 h for the expression of MAS. Uninduced cells were used
as negative controls in the experiments. Expression and characterization
of HA-tagged rat AT1R (HA-AT1R) in the HEK293 cell line were described
previously (HEK-AT1R).43

Co-immunoprecipitation
of Filamin with FBM-Containing GPCRs
HEK293 and HEK-AT1R
cells were used for these experiments. For
the filamin–GPCR interaction experiment, HEK293 and HEK-AT1R
cells were serum starved for 4 h. The cells were lysed in Triton X-100
lysis buffer [0.8% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM PMSF, and leupeptin and aprotinin
at 10 μg mL–1 each]; 2 mg of total protein
was used to immunoprecipitate AT1R using the anti-HA affinity matrix
(Roche). Immunoprecipitates were resolved using 8% sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
and immunoblotted for filamin using anti-Filamin A monoclonal antibody
MAB1680 (Millipore). Blots were stripped and reblotted for HA to confirm
immunoprecipitation of HA-AT1R.

Evaluating Filamin Phosphorylation
Levels in Cells Expressing
FBM-Containing GPCRs
HEK-AT1R and HEK-MAS cells were used
for these experiments. For the analysis of filamin phosphorylation,
HEK-AT1R cells were grown until they reached 80–90% confluency.
The cells were serum starved for 2 h and were pretreated with either
vehicle or AT1R antagonist candesartan (10 μM) for 30 min. Following
this, AT1R-expressing cells were treated with either vehicle or agonist
angiotensin II (1 μM) for 1 h. Whole cell protein lysates were
prepared from these cells in Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent
buffer (M-PER from Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal quantities (∼25 μg)
of these lysates were separated via 4 to 12% SDS–PAGE and then
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis.
The membranes were probed with pFLNa, FLNa, and GAPDH antibodies and
suitable near-infrared (IR) dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR,
Lincoln, NE). The ratios of phospho-FLNa (pFLNa) to FLNa were calculated
on the basis of the fluorescence values and expressed as fold increase
over uninduced/untreated controls. GAPDH was used as an additional
control to confirm equivalent total protein loaded in the lanes. Data
for AT1R are presented as an average [mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM)] of two independent experiments (N = 2). Significance levels of an unpaired Student’s t test are p &lt; 0.05. The HEK-MAS cells
were induced for 24 h with or without 10 μM AR-inverse
agonist. This was followed by serum starvation of cells for
2 h without any inhibitors or with a combination of 10 μM AR-inverse agonist or 10 μM PKA-inhibitor (H-89) depending
on the experimental design. During induction and serum starvation,
AR-inverse agonist was added to the HEK-MAS cells
to prevent constitutive activation of MAS. Following serum starvation
and pretreatment with inhibitors, the cells were treated with 10 μM
AR-agonist along with PKA inhibitor H-89 for 1 h.
FLNa phosphorylation in whole cell protein lysates was assayed on
Western blots as described for HEK-AT1R. Data for MAS are presented
as an average (mean ± SEM) of three independent experiments (N = 3). Significance levels of an unpaired Student’s t test are p &lt; 0.05.

Results
Frequency of
FBMs in GPCRs
In a recent study,37 we recognized that filamin ligand peptides from
integrins and migfilin enhance PKA-mediated phosphorylation of S2152
in filamin by relieving autoinhibition of the Ig21 repeat by Ig20.
Because some GPCRs are known to interact with filamin,13−15 we parsed the literature for GPCR-derived peptides that were reported
to bind filamin. The D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) peptide from the ICL3
region was shown to bind Ig19 of filamin. Many such peptides derived
from cell adhesion-related proteins bind class A Ig repeats of filamin
as reported previously.32 Similar to these
peptides, the D3R peptide increased the rate of PKA-mediated phosphorylation
at S2152 in the purified 100 kDa FLNa Ig16–24, a filamin surrogate,
as described previously36,37 (Figure 1A). The effect though was not as pronounced
as those of strong binding migfilin, integrin β7, and GP1bα-derived
peptides.37 The stronger ligands relieve
autoinhibition more effectively, thereby enhancing S2152 phosphorylation
by PKA. The result suggested that D3R not only binds to Ig19 but also
may bind to Ig21.32 We confirmed that this
ICL3 peptide from D3 dopamine receptor (D3R) binds FLNa Ig19 and Ig21
(Figure 1B,C) just
as other filamin binding peptides by HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The affinity
of the D3R peptide for Ig21 could not be assessed accurately by ITC
because of its lower affinity. However, this observation led us to
explore the possibility that the presence of FBM sequence in GPCRs
might be a conserved feature essential for directly engaging filamin
in cells and activating FLNa phosphorylation. We therefore used sequence
and structural information about known binders for the class A Ig
domain of FLNa including D3R and defined a consensus FBM for GPCRs
(see Experimental Procedures and Figure 2). A bioinformatics
screening of the sequences of 824 human GPCRs uncovered conservation
of FBMs in the cytoplasmic regions of 116 nonolfactory GPCRs (Table S1) and 73 olfactory GPCRs (Table S2). Of particular significance to the
cell biological function of GPCRs is the finding that FBMs were predominantly
located in the functionally significant regions of GPCRs, the cytoplasmic
tail (Ct) followed by intracellular loop 3 (ICL3). Several novel candidate
GPCRs that can potentially engage FLNa with high affinity were found
in our search.

various sources. A dagger denotes X-ray structures (chain annotation).
A section mark denotes NMR structure. Double daggers denote homologous
sequences of integrin β1 and integrin β3, and predicted

The most conserved residue position is designated 0, and all residues
are labeled accordingly (numbering above the alignment). The cartoon
of the β-sheet on the top of the alignment depicts the secondary
structure adopted by the FLNa ligand in the PDB structures. The residues
that are important for defining the FLNa binding motif (FBM) are also
highlighted with shading. (B) Overlay of FLNa ligands on FLNA Ig21
upon structural alignment of Ig21 and Ig17 from different PDB structures
(2BRQ, 2J3S, 2W0P, 2BP3, 2JF1, and 3ISW). The Ig21 structure
from 2J3S is
represented by the electrostatic potential on the surface calculated
using the program APBS40 and contoured
at ±12kT/e. Acidic and basic charged surface areas are colored
red and blue, respectively. The internal FBM peptide from Ig20 (2J3S)
is shown as a cartoon and colored cyan. The FBMs from integrin β7,
integrin β2, migfilin, CFTR, and GPIbα are shown as sticks.
The acidic patch on Ig21 and the complementary basic residues of the
FBMs are circled. The N-terminus of the bound peptide (cyan) is in
the circled part (left side of the protein), and the C-terminal end
of the bound peptide (cyan) is sticking out of the Ig repeat on the
right side of the Ig repeat.

We selected AT1R and MAS from this list for experimental
verification
given their importance in cardiovascular physiology. The FBM in AT1R
and MAS is present in the Ct. In the recently determined structure
of AT1R,44 the position of FBM overlaps
with the functionally important and structurally flexible “helix
8” region. The α1D-adrenoreceptor (α1D-AR) with cardiovascular and neuronal roles was chosen as
a representative GPCR with the predicted FBM in ICL3.45,46 The ICL3 loop is a very important determinant for G protein activation
by GPCRs. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies
reporting the direct interaction of these three GPCRs with FLNa.

FLNa Ig 21 Binds to Predicted FBMs from AT1R, MAS, and α1D-AR
FLNa Ig21 is the representative filamin Ig repeat
used extensively to test ligand binding.32,35 We therefore performed NMR spectroscopy and ITC experiments on the
binding of this repeat with the GPCR-derived FBM peptides. Binding
of all three FBM peptides to Ig21 resulted in significant changes
in the 15N HSQC spectra (Figure 3A,C,E). In the spectra, peaks for G2267,
G2270, and S2279 that occupy the top and bottom of the “CD”
ligand binding groove showed changes that are typical of high-affinity
binders.32,36 Hence, these peptides most likely bind in
a mode similar to that of the known filamin Ig–peptide complex
structures through a β-strand augmentation. ITC experiments
estimated the binding affinities of peptide motifs of AT1R, MAS, and
α1D-AR for FLNa Ig21 with Kd values of 0.8, 0.3, and 0.8 μM, respectively. These
binding affinities are 50–100 times higher than those of the
FBM peptides from cell adhesion proteins, the integrins, which are
the most common filamin binding proteins in a majority of cell types
(see Discussion). The β7 integrin Ct
peptide binds Ig21 with a Kd of 40 μM.47 These binding affinities are among the tightest
known to bind filamin with the exception of the platelet specific
protein, GPIbα,32 which has an affinity
of 0.1 μM.

Figure 3 Interaction of AT1R, MAS, and α1D-AR
FBMs with
FLNa Ig21. HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled FLNa Ig21 repeat
with (A) AT1R, (C) MAS, and (E) α1D-AR peptides show
extensive spectral changes indicating a strong binding event. The
peptides used in the experiments are also shown with the residues
colored as described in the legend of Figure 2. (B, D, and F) Corresponding ITC measurements
with calculated binding affinities are shown. These affinities are
tighter than those of any know GPCR peptide and protein partners determined
by isothermal calorimetry. The α1D-AR peptide was
at a concentration of 0.4 mM in the syringe, unlike the concentration
of 1 mM for AT1R and MAS, and hence, the slope of the titration is
different, though the affinities are comparable.

Given that the filamin–adhesion receptor FBM interaction
is tightly coupled to filamin phosphorylation at S2152 by PKA,37 we tested the effect of these GPCR FBM peptides
on FLNa phosphorylation at S2152 in the filamin surrogate, FLNa Ig16–24,
by PKA in an in vitro kinase assay. As expected,
binding of these FBM peptides enhanced the rate of phosphorylation
of the 100 kDa surrogate of FLNa at S2152 by PKA in vitro (Figure 4) like the conventionally
known FLNa ligands, integrins, and migfilin.32 This enhancement of filamin S2152 phosphorylation by high-affinity
FBM peptides derived from AT1R, MAS, and α1D-AR was
much more robust than that of the D3R-derived peptide that binds with
a lower affinity (Figure 1A vs Figure 4). This observation further emphasizes our premise that tighter binding
ligands drive the filamin Ig21 domain conformation toward a PKA compliant
state.32 These findings validate the finding
that the predicted FBMs in GPCRs are bona fide functional units and
therefore may confer the ability to recruit FLNa to agonist-activated
GPCRs in cells.

AT1R Binds to Filamin, and the Agonist Treatment of AT1R Promotes
Filamin Phosphorylation
To demonstrate ligand regulation
of a native GPCR interaction with filamin in cells, we selected ATIR
as a model receptor. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged rat AT1R from
detergent-solubilized HEK-AT1R cell lysates using an anti-HA monoclonal
antibody showed co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Filamin A (280
kDa) with HA-AT1R (≈78 kDa). HEK cells not expressing HA-AT1R
were used as a negative control (Figure 5A). Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged AT1R
is shown in the bottom panel (Figure 5A). We next examined whether ligand-modulated receptor
activity is associated with phosphorylation of filamin in cells. Treatment
of the cells with the agonist peptide AngII led to a 5-fold higher
level of filamin phosphorylation, and treatment with the inverse agonist,
candesartan, reduced the level of filamin phosphorylation to basal
levels (Figure 5B).
Together, these results demonstrate that endogenous Filamin A binds
AT1R and agonist activation of AT1R enhances phosphorylation of cellular
filamin at S2152, suggesting a direct role for AT1R in actin remodeling
through filamin.

(B) AT1R-mediated FLNa phosphorylation upon stimulation with AngII
and the lack of FLNa phosphorylation when treated with the antagonist
candesartan. The data represent two independent (N = 2) experiments.

Physical and Functional
Interaction of MAS with FLNa
We studied MAS to substantiate
GPCR-linked filamin phosphorylation
results, as MAS is a constitutively active oncogenic GPCR with promiscuous
G protein coupling ability.42 In addition,
it contains a bona fide FBM that binds Ig21 with very high affinity
as measured by robust biophysical techniques (Figure 3C,D). For these studies, we used the tetracycline-inducible
system of myc-tagged human MAS expression in HEK293 cells as previously
described.42 We examined functional coupling
between MAS and endogenous FLNa in tetracycline-induced cells by monitoring
FLNa phosphorylation at S2152. The uninduced cells served as a control.
Tetracycline induction of MAS expression alone caused a 7-fold increase
in the level of phosphorylation of FLNa (Figure 6A). This is not surprising as we and others
have reported the high constitutive activity of MAS.42,48,49 FLNa phosphorylation induced
by the constitutive activity of MAS was abolished in cells treated
with a specific inhibitor of the constitutive activity of MAS, AR-inverse agonist (Figure 6B). Treatment of MAS-expressing cells with a specific
MAS agonist, AR-agonist, further increased the level
of phosphorylation of FLNa 10-fold (Figure 6A). Agonist stimulation of cells pretreated
with AR-inverse agonist (during induction) resulted
in a 9-fold increase in the level of FLNa phosphorylation (Figure 6B). Unlike AT1R,
MAS activates all major G proteins in cells, including the Gs protein-coupled cAMP pathway leading to the activation of PKA. Consistent
with this finding, treatment of MAS agonist-activated cells with the
PKA inhibitor, H-89, resulted in reversal of the phosphorylated FLNa
(pFLNa) levels to constitutive levels (Figure 6A). Furthermore, treatment with H-89 decreased
the pFLNa levels by 60% in cells pretreated with AR-inverse
agonist. These experiments demonstrate that only a part of
FLNa phosphorylation in cells by both constitutive and agonist activation
of MAS is PKA-dependent. The remaining phosphorylation takes place
perhaps by other cellular Ser/Thr kinases.

of MAS with FLNa. (A) MAS-mediated FLNa
phosphorylation upon stimulation with AR-agonist and
its inhibition by PKA inhibitor H-89 in MAS-expressing [induced (IN)]
and control [uninduced (UI)] cells. (B) FLNa phosphorylation under
inhibition of constitutive activity. Inhibition of constitutive activation
of MAS by AR-inverse agonist (AR-inv) abolished constitutive FLNa phosphorylation. Under these conditions,
treatment with AR-agonist stimulated maximal FLNa
phosphorylation. PKA inhibitor H-89 partially inhibited AR-agonist-induced FLNa phosphorylation. Data are averages
(mean ± SEM) of three independent experiments (N = 3).

Experiments depicted in Figures 5 and 6 suggest that the FBM
in AT1R and MAS likely adopts a FLNa binding conformation only upon
receptor activation. AT1R does not signal constitutively and needs
agonist binding to activate the filamin binding mode; however, MAS
likely binds filamin constitutively and hence leads to constitutive
filamin phosphorylation. These results emphasize that it is the active
receptor that mediates filamin phosphorylation by PKA or other cellular
S/T kinases. Overall, our data suggest (i) conservation of FBM in
GPCRs and (ii) receptor activation-dependent phosphorylation of FLNa
that is most likely a consequence of FLNa–GPCR interactions.

receptor couples to filamin, thereby releasing autoinhibition of filamin,
and this in turn promotes PKA-mediated S2152 phosphorylation.

Discussion
Impetus
for (i) the bioinformatics discovery of FBM in &gt;20% of
GPCRs and (ii) experimental validation of GPCRs as bona fide ligands
for relieving the autoinhibited state of FLNa is based on our recently
reported findings.37 It was found that
phosphorylation of S2152 in filamin was dependent on relieving autoinhibition
of Ig20 by engagement of Ig21 by receptors harboring an FBM. Conventionally
studied filamin activators were peptides derived from cell adhesion
molecules. Migfilin, integrin β7, and GPIbα peptides enhanced
PKA-mediated filamin phosphorylation in vitro, indicating
that functionally diverse ligands can promote filamin phosphorylation.
Regulation of the homeostatic equilibrium between FLNa and pFLNa by
these conventional activators is known to be critical in cell cytoskeletal
dynamics, leading to changes in cell adhesion responses.33 Though there is literature about filamin–GPCR
interaction at the functional and biochemical level, broad generalizations
were obscure at best. The D2R and D3R peptides were the most clearly
recognized class A filamin binders.38,32 The extent
of the involvement of FBMs in GPCRs, the superfamily of cell surface
receptors for conducting FLNa-mediated cytoskeletal signaling, is
a major gap in the current knowledge base. To bridge this gap, we
report here for the first time a consensus FBM in GPCRs and identify
several GPCRs that contain FBMs in their intracellular regions. We
noticed several important GPCRs that are part of this select GPCR
list (Table S1). For example, lysophosphatidic
acid treatment was reported to increase the level of FLNa phosphorylation
in previous studies.50 However, the role
of any particular receptor in the process was not addressed. Our predicted
hits contain lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2, suggesting a possible
role for this receptor in directly engaging FLNa. Similarly, kinin
treatment was shown to alter filamin translocation in endothelial
cells.51,52 The roles of B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors
(B1R and B2R) were mentioned in this process, but never proven. In
our predictions, we identified B2R to contain the FBM, and most interestingly,
a pairwise sequence alignment between B1R and B2R reveals a gap in
the sequence of B1R at the homologous region spanning the entire length
of the FBM, thus providing evidence of the role of B2R but not B1R
in the process. Similar, differences in the FBM regions were seen
in neuropeptide FF receptors 1 and 2 and dopamine receptors.

Along with the known filamin binders such as dopamine receptors,
we also identified several important GPCRs that respond to serotonin,
acetylcholine, opioids, angiotensin, chemokines, eicosanoids, and
fatty acid ligands. Our list also included the recently identified
CXCR4 FBM as a positive hit, although the FBM in this receptor spans
both the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions. The list also has
several orphan, olfactory, and taste receptors. Few of the GPCRs that
were previously reported to interact with filamin are absent from
our list. This is expected as in this study we attempted to define
FBM for only class A repeats in FLNa with very strict criteria. We
speculate that via expansion of the definition of FBM to include proteins
binding to (1) repeats other than class A and (2) other filamin isoforms
(B and C), the predicted list of GPCRs for interacting with filamin
would be substantially large. More crystal structures of peptide motifs
with FLN Ig domains would further aid in improving these predictions.
Because our predictions are based on a limited number of crystal structures
with peptides, the potential for false positive hits as well as missing
more potent filamin binding GPCRs cannot be excluded. Our search criteria
were stringent, and all 12 residues needed for filamin engagement
were filtered to be part of cytoplasmic regions (see Experimental Procedures).

From the predicted list, we
picked three different GPCRs, MAS,
AT1R, and α1D-AR, which are important in cardiovascular
physiology, for further experimental validation. These three receptor
peptides have no known topological constraints with respect to binding
filamin. Using NMR and ITC, we show unambiguous tight binding of the
FBM peptides to FLNa Ig21. The affinities in the nanomolar range determined
by ITC are extremely rare for filamin binders. Only the platelet specific
GP1bα receptor peptide shows a binding tighter than those of
the three GPCRs listed above.32 Compared
to integrins,47 the three GPCR peptides
tested here have 50–100-fold higher affinity and are likely
to be very biologically potent. We are not aware of any report of
GPCR peptides showing such high affinity by ITC for any known GPCR
binder. The only study we came across is the binding of the cannabinoid
receptor peptide to β-arrestin with an affinity of 2 μM.54 Furthermore, the bound FBM peptides promoted
rapid phosphorylation of FLNa at S2152 under in vitro conditions, validating our biophysical studies.

In strong
support of the in vitro findings that
ligand binding induces FLNa phosphorylation at S2152, we observed
robust phosphorylation of FLNa on the S2152 site in cells expressing
the FBM-containing GPCRs, AT1R and MAS. We note that unlike AT1R there
was strong basal/constitutive (agonist-independent) filamin phosphorylation
induced by MAS. This was expected as the cAMP levels are significantly
higher at basal levels in MAS-expressing cells,42,48 causing PKA activation that could be inhibited by H-89. To tease
out acute or short-term signaling effects of MAS and its consequences
in cells, we inhibited constitutive activity by adding AR-inverse agonist to the cells at the time of induction. This
allowed us to demonstrate the receptor activation-dependent increase
in the level of phosphorylation of FLNa. The lack of robust reagents
prevented us from extending our results to α1D-AR.

Intriguingly, only 60% of the increase in pFLNa in MAS-expressing
cells was inhibited by H-89, suggesting the involvement of kinases
other than PKA in the process.12 The residual
component of pFLNa is most likely generated by kinases that are activated
in the cells by other G protein pathways.50,55 Constitutive or ligand-dependent activation of AT1R and MAS likely
introduces conformational changes in the FBM that is suitable for
FLNa engagement. Thereby, AT1R and MAS directly bind to Ig21 and prevent
autoinhibition of FLNa Ig21 by Ig20. The resultant GPCR-bound FLNa
becomes a substrate for kinases (not limited to PKA) that are active
in cells through signaling or independently by other mechanisms. Ser/Thr
kinase such as ribosomal S6 kinase activated upon AT1R activation
is a known FLNa phosphorylating kinase.50,56 Overall, kinases
increase pFLNa levels in the cells and likely promote cytoskeletal
assembly. Taken together, these two receptors seem to couple with
filamin during or immediately after agonist activation. Antagonist
binding prevents phosphorylation of filamin with both of these receptors,
validating our agonist data. The details of this process most likely
involve a helix/loop to β-strand change in the Ct regions of
the receptors that transiently enhances filamin binding only in the
presence of the agonists. The cytoplasmic regions of GPCR also bind β-arrestin
following agonist activation. In a previous proteomic study, FLNa
was shown to interact with β-arrestin.57 Whether β-arrestin assembly plays a role in the interaction
of FLNa with GPCRs and subsequent FLNa phosphorylation is currently
unknown and is an interesting area for future research. The enhanced
engagement of filamin to an activated receptor is seen in some recent
work though not recognized as such.53 Our
model provides a molecular explanation of the previously reported
G protein signaling-mediated filamin phosphorylation in which direct
FLNa–GPCR interaction was not observed (Figure 7).50,58

This is the first report
to demonstrate filamin phosphorylation
tied to the activation status of GPCRs. Filamin phosphorylation has
been linked to defects in neuronal migration, actin binding, and cytoplasmic
localization59 through guanine exchange
factor ARFGEF2. Interestingly, agonist-dependent filamin phosphorylation
appears not to be limited to Gs-coupled GPCRs as observed
in this study and in other reports. This implies that a cAMP-independent
activation of PKA may play a role in case of those GPCRs. Evidence
of such a phenomenon is available for mouse AT1A and endothelin-1
receptors.60 Filamin phosphorylation might
reposition filamin with respect to the plasma membrane because of
charge repulsion, and in this new microenvironment, its binding partners
may change, thereby bridging a different set of proteins. Filamin
seems necessary for optimal coupling of G protein to D3R,14 and dopamine treatment has been shown to reduce
the extent of binding of filamin to the receptor.61 Filamin has been shown to form a complex with the β-arrestin
and GPCR in at least three cases, i.e., D3R,61 AT1R, and muscarinic M1 receptor (M1MR).62 The Ig22 domain of filamin was characterized as the most likely
docking site for β-arrestin, and a β-arrestin–FLNa–receptor
complex regulates ERK activation and membrane ruffling.62 However, direct binding of filamin to the AT1R
and M1MR was not considered a mechanism in the previous work. However,
our bioinformatics search identified a potetnial FBM in M1MR (Table S1). More structural information acquired
by NMR or crystallography will help in robust hypothesis generation
to unravel the precise molecular details. In AT1R and MAS, the FBM
is part of the cytoplasmic helix 8 that plays a crucial but imprecisely
defined role in various GPCRs.63 In AT1R
and other GPCRs, this region was also shown and/or predicted to bind
to tubulin.64 In most crystal structures
of GPCRs, this region is a helix, part of a helix, or unstructured
or has missing electron density (PDB entries 4DAJ, 2R4S, 3ODU, 3VW7, and 4YAY). We envisage an
agonist/antagonist-dependent conformational switch in this region
of many GPCRs that facilitate filamin engagement. Given our data,
the role that filamin and its phosphorylation plays in GPCR function
will have to be pursued with more vigor.

On a final note, the
class A Ig repeats of filamin mainly bind
unstructured segments of membrane receptors. It is also interesting
to note that the cytoplasmic regions, especially the ICL3 and Ct regions
of GPCRs, are highly variable in length and are predicted to be intrinsically
disordered.65,66 Given that &gt;30% of the eukaryotic
proteomes contains disordered segments,67−69 it is tempting to speculate
that filamin may bind many more proteins than currently recognized.
Moreover, Filamin Ig repeats have expanded in number during eukaryotic
evolution,70 and this may have some correlation
with the expansion of disordered segments in many signaling proteins.
There is speculation in the literature that millions of such disordered
motifs may exist,71 and large proteins
like filamin with their ability to bind these motifs may have co-evolved.
FLNa is also alternately spliced, resulting in an isoform that lacks
autoinhibtion and the S2152 phosphorylation site.72,73 Filamin isoform switching may therefore regulate both mechanistic
and signaling outcomes during animal development.
