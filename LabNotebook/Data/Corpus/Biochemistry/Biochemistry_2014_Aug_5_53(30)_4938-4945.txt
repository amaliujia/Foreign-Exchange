Efficient
integration of extracellular
and intracellular signals is required to maintain adaptive cellular
functions. The signaling systems of cyclic adenosine and guanosine
3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP and cGMP, respectively) represent
the earliest identified signaling pathways in the regulation of a
vast number of critical physiological processes, including visual
transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, gene expression,
inflammation, apoptosis, steroidogenesis, insulin secretion, glycogen
synthesis, glycogenolysis, lipogenesis, and lipolysis.− Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play important roles
in these physiological processes with their ability to decompose cellular
cAMP and cGMP.− Inhibitors of human PDEs have been widely studied
as therapeutics for the treatment of diseases, such as central nerve
system diseases and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.− A well-known
example of this drug class is the PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil (Viagra)
that has been approved for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction
and pulmonary hypertension.,

The superfamily
of PDE can be categorized into two main classes
of nonhomologous proteins that have been known to specifically hydrolyze
cAMP and cGMP, although a third class of PDE was mentioned but not
fully characterized. All PDEs found in
mammals and flies belong to class I, while yeast and protozoans contain
classes I and II PDEs. The conserved catalytic domain of class I PDEs
consists of ∼300 amino acids and contains two divalent metal
ions, typically zinc and magnesium/manganese, to facilitate the catalysis. The yeast genome contains two types of PDEs:
yPDE1 and yPDE2. Yeast PDE2 is a member of the class I PDE superfamily
and shares a similar folding of its catalytic domain with human PDEs,
whereas yPDE1 belongs to the class II PDE superfamily and uses two
zinc ions for its catalysis. The sequence
alignment suggests that yPDE1 has a structural folding different from
that of class I PDEs but shares a partially common pattern with other
metalloproteins such as metallo-β-lactamase (MBL). Because no three-dimensional structure is available
for any member of class II PDEs, how yPDE1 is evolutionarily related
to class I PDEs and other metalloenzymes remains a puzzle.

The
signaling of cAMP in yeast has been shown to play critical
roles in physiological processes, including metabolism, cell wall
biosynthesis, cell growth, and mating.− Overexpression of the PDE2 gene enhances the tolerance of yeast
to oxidative and ethanol stress for survival.− Both yPDE1 and
yPDE2 appear to participate in the cAMP signaling pathway, although
yPDE2 shows high affinity with a KM of
0.17–1.0 μM for cAMP,− and yPDE1 has a low affinity
with a KM of 100–150 μM.,, In comparison with numerous publications
about the roles of cAMP in the physiological processes of yeast, the
cGMP signaling pathway has not been well studied, although it was
reported that cGMP activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase of Pichia pastoris yeast. There
is only one report showing that yPDE1 from Candida albicans has very weak cGMP activity with a KM of 250 μM and a Vmax of 0.044
μmol mg–1 min–1, in comparison
with a KM of 490 μM and a Vmax of 1.17 μmol mg–1 min–1 for cAMP. Thus,
physiological roles of the cGMP signaling pathway in yeast remain
illusive. This paper reports the enzymatic properties of full length
yPDE1 and shows that yPDE1 has a dual activity on hydrolysis of both
cAMP and cGMP with similar enzymatic efficacies. The crystal structure
of yPDE1 at 1.31 Å resolution reveals a new topological folding
that is different from those of human PDEs.

Experimental Procedures
Subcloning
and Protein Purification of Yeast PDE1
The
cDNA of full length yPDE1 (residues 1–369) from bakers’
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was subcloned into
vector pET28a for expression. Oligonucleotide primers containing the
NheI and EcoRI sites were designed and synthesized for amplification
of yPDE1 by polymerase chain reaction. Amplified yPDE1 cDNA and expression
vector pET28a were separately digested by restriction enzymes NheI
and EcoRI, purified on an agarose gel, and then ligated by T4 DNA
ligase. The resultant pET28-yPDE1 plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing
and then transferred into Escherichia coli strain
BL21 (CodonPlus) for expression. When the cells were grown in 2×YT
culture medium at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.7, 0.1 mM
isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added
to induce the overexpression of wild-type yPDE1 at 15 °C for
2 days.

The selenomethionyl mutant of yPDE1 was expressed in
M9 minimal medium (6 g of Na2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 1 g of NH4Cl, 0.5 g of NaCl, 2
mM MgSO4, 4 g of glucose, 100 mg of ampicillin, 50 mg of
selenomethionine, 100 mg of lysine, 100 mg of threonine, 100 mg of
phenylalanine, 50 mg of leucine, 50 mg of isoleucine, and 50 mg of
valine per liter). A colony of E. coli transferred
with pET28-yPDE1 was grown in 10 mL of 2×YT medium at 37 °C
overnight, centrifuged at 5000 rpm at room temperature, and then resuspended
in 500 mL of prewarmed M9 medium at 37 °C. After the cells had
been cultured at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.4–0.5,
0.1 mM IPTG was added to induce the overexpression at 12 °C for
∼2 days.

The harvested cells were suspended in an extraction
buffer of 20
mM Tris base (pH 8.0), 0.3 M NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, and 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol
(β-ME) and lysed by being passed once through a Nano DeBee homogenizer.
After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 2.5 cm column
containing 10 mL of Ni-nitriloacetic acid (NTA) agarose (QIAGEN).
The column was washed with two buffers [20 mM Tris base (pH 8.0),
15 mM imidazole, and 1 mM β-ME with 50 or 300 mM NaCl], and
then yPDE1 was eluted with 20 mM Tris base (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 150
mM imidazole, and 1 mM β-ME. After digestion with thrombin at
room temperature for 2 h, the digested sample was loaded on a Q-Sepharose
column (2.5 cm × 8 cm). The column was washed with ∼100
mL of 20 mM Tris base (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM β-ME, and 1
mM EDTA and eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 200 mM NaCl.
The yPDE1 protein was finally purified with a Superdex 200 column
using a buffer of 20 mM Tris base (pH 7.5), 1 mM β-ME, 1 mM
EDTA, and 50 mM NaCl. The combined yPDE1 fractions were concentrated
to 6–10 mg/mL and stored in −80 °C for use.

Enzymatic
Assay
The enzymatic activity was assayed
using [3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP as a substrate, as
previously reported for human PDE. Briefly,
yPDE1 was incubated in a reaction mixture of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)
and [3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP (20–40K cpm/assay)
at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the
addition of 0.2 M ZnSO4. The reaction product [3H]AMP or [3H]GMP was precipitated out by addition of 0.2
N Ba(OH)2, while unreacted [3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP remained in the supernatant. Radioactivity in the supernatant
was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. The enzymatic properties
were analyzed by the steady state kinetics. The Michaelis–Menten
equation was used to obtain KM, Vmax, and kcat by
nonlinear regression and also by an Eadie–Hofstee plot.

The yPDE1 activity was tested in a buffer
of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and also this plain buffer with 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.01 mM ZnCl2, 1 mM EDTA,
or 1 mM DTT. In addition, the yPDE1 activity was assayed after dialysis
against a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM
EDTA, three times (1 h, 2 h, and overnight).

Crystallization, Structure
Determination, and Comparison
The crystal of native yPDE1
(6 mg/mL) was grown by the hanging drop
method against a buffer of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5% PEG3350, 40 mM
lithium sulfate, and 12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) at room temperature,
or a similar buffer but with 15% glycerol and 20% MPD instead of 12%
MPD. The native yPDE1 crystals diffracted to 1.31 Å resolution
and are in space group C2221 with the
following cell dimensions: a = 74 Å, b = 85 Å, and c = 130 Å (Table ). The selenomethionyl yPDE1 (11 mg/mL) was crystallized
at room temperature by the hanging drop method against a well buffer
of 6% PEG3350, 30 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 60 mM ammonium acetate,
75–100 mM ammonium sulfate, and 3% glycerol. The Se-yPDE1 crystals
are in space group P21 with the following
cell dimensions: a = 68 Å, b = 57 Å, c = 102 Å, and β = 106.7°.
The yPDE1–GMP complex was prepared by soaking the native yPDE1
crystal in the crystallization buffer with 50 mM cGMP at room temperature
for 2 days.

The single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data for selenomethionyl
yPDE1 were collected at the k-edge of Se (λ = 0.97920), and
the data of native yPDE1 and its complex with cGMP were collected
at λ = 1.075 on beamline X29 of the Brookhaven National Laboratory
(Table ). All the data were processed with
HKL. Three Se sites were found for the
SAD data with SHELX and used to phase the structure with PHENIX. Improvement of the SAD phases yielded a figure
of merit of 0.66 for the data at 2.3 Å resolution, and the Fo map clearly revealed the trace of the yPDE1
structure. The atomic model was built with O and refined with REFMAC.

The
yPDE1 structure was compared with structures in the Protein
Data Bank by the online program Dali (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/structure/dalilite). The results were ranked by Dali’s Z score
and rmsd. A structure with a Z score of &gt;2.0 is assumed thought to be partially similar
with that of yPDE1, and a higher Z score indicates
better similarity.

Results
Yeast PDE1 Hydrolyzes both
cAMP and cGMP
The native
bakers’ yeast yPDE1 was shown to contain two zinc ions per
molecule by an atomic absorption spectrometer. In a plain assay buffer without divalent metals, our recombinant
yPDE1 shows similar enzymatic efficacy for hydrolysis of cAMP and
cGMP: KM of 110 μM and kcat of 16.9 s–1 for cAMP and KM of 105 μM and kcat of 11.8 s–1 for cGMP (Table ). Thus, the enzymatic efficacy kcat/KM of yPDE1 is 0.153 and
0.113 for cAMP and cGMP, respectively. The specificity constant (kcat/KMcAMP)/(kcat/KMcGMP) of 1.4 suggests a dual activity of yPDE1 on hydrolysis
of both cAMP and cGMP, with a slightly better efficacy on cAMP than
cGMP. Our KM of yPDE1 for cAMP is comparable
with the early report of KM values of
100–120 μM, but our yPDE1 enzyme is much more active,
as shown by a Vmax at least 20-fold higher
than those of the previously reported proteins.,,

yPDE1 protein was dialyzed three
times against a buffer of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, and
1 mM EDTA (1 h, 2 h, and overnight).

Because human PDEs require magnesium or manganese
for maximization
of their activities, a few types of divalent metal ions were added
to the assay buffer to test if they promote the activity of yPDE1.
In summary, addition of 10 μM ZnCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, or 10 mM MgCl2 to the assay buffer did not significantly
promote or inhibit the catalytic activities of our recombinant yPDE1
upon hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP (Table ).
These results are consistent with the early observations that yPDE1
from S. cerevisiae or C. albicans was not sensitive to the divalent metals., In addition, the dialysis of native yPDE1 against 1 mM EDTA overnight
did not change the catalytic efficacy (kcat/KM) for cAMP but slightly decreased kcat/KM for cGMP
(Table ), implying that the dialysis was not
efficient for the extraction of the zinc ions that coordinate with
four yPDE1 residues. On the other hand, DTT significantly inhibits
our yPDE1 activity, in contrast to the fact that DTT promotes the
activity of human PDEs.

Architecture of the yPDE1 Structure
The 369 amino acids
of yPDE1 are folded into 16 β-stands, 10 α-helices, and
two 310-helices (Figure A). The
16 β-strands can be divided into two sheets that form a sandwich
and a hydrophobic core of the molecule. The center of the molecular
core looks like a distorted β-barrel and is flanked by the helices.
Two molecules of yPDE1 are tightly associated into a dimer (Figure B,C). For the massive interactions between two monomers,
we assume that the dimeric form of yPDE1 is a biologic unit for its
function. This argument is supported by the gel filtration experiment
in which the recombinant yPDE1 protein appears to be a dimer in the
solution (data not shown) and also by the structural assembly in which
two monomers jointly form the active site of yPDE1 (Figure ).

spheres. (C) Surface presentation of the yPDE1 dimer. Molecule A (top)
is colored as follows: white for carbon, blue for nitrogen, and red
for oxygen. Molecule B is colored cyan.

The active site pocket of yPDE1 can be divided into three
portions.
The bottom part of the pocket is composed of residues His128, His130,
Asp132, His133, His213, Asp244, and His326, which are entirely contributed
by molecule A of the dimer. Residues Glu289, Tyr292, His294, and Lys328
of molecule A constitute one wall of the catalytic pocket, while Pro142,
Tyr145, Trp175, Pro176, and Leu178 of molecule B form another wall
of the pocket (Figure A). Two divalent metal
ions sit in the bottom of the pocket, each of which forms four coordinations
with His128, His130, His213, and Asp244, or with Asp132, His133, Asp244,
and His326 of the same molecule of the dimer (Figure B). In addition, a sulfate ion was found to coordinate with
the two zinc ions in the structure of unliganded yPDE1. This sulfate
must come from the excess Li2SO4 (40 mM) in
the crystallization buffer, and its occupancy is supported by the
clear electron density and a small B factor of 17.8
Å2 comparable with the average value of 18.4 Å2 for protein atoms. Also, a water molecule or hydroxide ion
bridges both metal ions, to form an octahedral configuration of each
ion (Figure B). Because zinc was identified
by atomic absorption spectrometry, two
zinc ions were assigned for the structural refinement without further
verification. This assignment is supported by the comparable B factors of the zinc ions (13.6 Å2) with
the overall average B factor of 18.4 Å2 for protein atoms (Table ).

the electron density of the Fo – Fc map that was calculated from the structure
with omission of GMP and contoured at 2.5σ.

Binding of GMP to the yPDE1 Dimer
The unliganded yPDE1
crystals were soaked in 50 mM cGMP or 25 mM cAMP for a couple of days.
Two data sets were collected from the soaked crystals to 1.31 Å
resolution (Table ). The Fo – Fc and 2Fo – Fc electron
density maps reveal the definite binding and conformation of GMP in
the cGMP-soaked crystal (Figure C). However,
the structural refinement shows a B factor of 35.9
Å2 for GMP, which is significantly higher than the
average B factor of 18.7 Å2 for protein
atoms, suggesting its low occupancy. This should not be surprising
because the product GMP is expected to weakly bind to yPDE1 on the
basis of the low affinity of substrate cGMP (KM of 104 μM). On the other hand, the cAMP-soaked crystal
shows some electron density at the binding pocket, but no unique conformation
can be identified.

The phosphate oxygens of GMP chelate with
two zinc ions, form two hydrogen bonds with the side chains of His294
and Lys328 of molecule A, and also closely contact zinc binding residues
His130, Asp132, His213, Asp244, and His326 of molecule A of the dimer
(Figure ). The ribose of GMP forms a hydrogen
bond with the side chain of Lys328 of molecule A, and van der Waals
contacts with residues Glu289 and His324 of molecule A, and Pro142
and Pro176 of molecule B. The guanine of GMP takes an anti configuration
and is located in a hydrophobic environment that is composed of Val217
and Tyr292 of molecule A and Tyr145, Pro176, and Leu178 of molecule
B.

Structural Comparison of yPDE1 with Other Metalloproteins
The online program Dali lists 591
metalloproteins and/or subunits in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which
have Z scores of &gt;2 and thus possess similar topological
folding, including ribonuclease Z, tRNA Z, metallo-β-lactamase
(MBL), protein PhnP, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor,
RNase J, metal-dependent hydrolase, human 5′-exonuclease Apollo,
coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein B, and human glyoxalase II, although
some of the protein structures contain manganese or ferric ions, instead
of zinc. Dali gives the best Z score of 24 to ribonuclease
Z (PDB entry 2CBN, rmsd of 2.9 Å for 245 of 306 total residues). However, two
zinc ions in ribonuclease Z are not directly involved in RNA binding
but apparently serve as the structural metals to stabilize the three-dimensional
structure. Thus, the structural similarity between yPDE1 and ribonuclease
Z might just mean a scaffold support for zinc binding without a functional
relationship. Also, on the top of the Dali list is a MBL-like protein
from Gram-negative Brucella melitensis [PDB entry 3MD7, Z score of 21.4, rmsd of 2.6 Å for 231 of total 270 residues
(Figure )], although it contains two manganese
ions as the catalytic metals. In the structure of the MBL-like protein,
the low occupancy of GMP at the Mn binding pocket was identified when
the compound was cocrystallized with GMP-PNP. The orientation of GMP in the MBL-like protein is the opposite of
that of GMP in yPDE1, while both of them have the common phosphate
interactions with the divalent metals (Figure ). Considering the fact that both MBL-like protein and yPDE1 require
a dimer for catalysis and have identical metal binding residues, yPDE1
might have an evolutionary relationship with the MBL-like protein.
In short, the structural comparison described above may suggest that
the zinc ions in yPDE1 may stabilize and facilitate the proper folding
of the yPDE1 structure, in addition to their main role as the catalytic
ions.

Discussion
A Putative Mechanism for the Catalysis of
yPDE1
It
has been well established that hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond
by class I PDEs is accomplished via a nucleophilic attack of the bridging
water or hydroxide ion., However, it is unknown
whether yPDE1 hydrolyzes cAMP and cGMP with the same catalytic mechanism
as human PDEs. Historically, an inversion of configuration at phosphorus
was proposed for the stereochemistry of the cAMP hydrolysis by PDE
in 1979. Later, the crystal structures
of PDE4 and PDE9-cGMP revealed a hydroxide ion (or a water molecule) that bridges
the divalent metal ions may serve as the nucleophile to attack the
phosphorus. This hydroxide ion may be activated by an aspartic or
glutamic acid (Asp318 or Glu230 in PDE4D2). After formation of an
intermediate covalent bond between the hydroxide ion and the phosphorus,
a histidine (His160 in PDE4D2) may donate a proton to complete the
hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. This model is consistent with
the mechanism of many other zinc enzymes that use an aspartic acid
as a general base to activate a water or hydroxide ion.

Yeast PDE1 contains two zinc ions as the
catalytic metals, instead of zinc and magnesium or manganese in human
PDEs. The crystal structure reveals a hydroxide ion or water molecule
that bridges two zinc ions of yPDE1, in a pattern similar to that
seen in the case of human PDEs. This hydroxide ion forms a hydrogen
bond with Asp132 and may thus be activated by Asp132 to initiate the
nucleophilic attack (Figures B and ). After the reaction intermediate forms, His294
that forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate group of GMP in the
crystal structure of yPDE1-GMP may serve as the proton donor to complete
the conversion of cGMP to GMP. Therefore, class II yPDE1 may share
a common catalytic mechanism with class I PDEs for the hydrolysis
of cAMP and cGMP, although they possess different structures and divalent
metals.

Proposed mechanism for yPDE1 catalysis. The catalysis may contain
the following steps. (A) The bridging hydroxide ion is activated by
Asp132 and attacks the phosphorus of cGMP. (B) Formation of the intermediate
of the reaction. (C) His294 donates a proton to the intermediate.
(D) Completion of the reaction. This mechanism is assumed to apply
to the catalysis of cAMP by yPDE1, too.

Implication of the Physiological Roles of yPDE1
Although
class II PDEs are found in a diverse number of species, including S. cerevisiae, C. albicans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Cryptococcus
neoformans, Dictyostelium discoideum, Leishmania mexicana, Trypanosoma brucei, Vibrio fischeri, and Trypanosoma cruzi, their physiological roles remain unclear.
The low affinity of cAMP for yPDE1 renders it nonfunctional at the
usual physiological concentration of cAMP. However, several studies
have shown critical roles of yPDE1 under extreme environments or stresses.
Deletion of yPDE1, but not yPDE2, resulted in a much higher level
of accumulation of cAMP upon addition of glucose or intracellular
acidification, suggesting a specific role of yPDE1 on agonist-induced
cAMP signaling. Also, deletion of PDE1
in C. albicans changed the level of expression of
genes, stress responses, cell wall and membrane biogenesis, adherence,
and virulence, suggesting irreplaceable roles of class II PDEs in
stress, adhesion, and virulence. Furthermore,
the genetic interactions of PDE1 with GPA2, a Gα protein controlling
yeast differentiation, caused synthetic
defects in growth, morphogenesis, and responses to some stresses,
suggesting that yPDE1 and Gpa2 modulate agonist-induced cAMP signaling.

While the cAMP signaling pathway of yPDE1
appears to play a secondary role in yeast physiological processes,
the function of the cGMP signaling pathway in yeast has not been well
characterized. Most studies focused on the cAMP signaling in which
yPDE1 and yPDE2 are involved,− but only a few papers about the function of the cGMP signaling in
yeast have been published., Because only the cAMP
activity of the four yPDE2 genes was reported, it is unknown if they
also have cGMP hydrolysis activities. Our study reveals for the first
time that yPDE1 is capable of hydrolyzing both cAMP and cGMP with
similar efficacies. However, it remains to be elucidated whether the
cGMP activity of yPDE1 plays an independent role in yeast physiological
processes or an auxiliary function to the cAMP signaling pathway.
