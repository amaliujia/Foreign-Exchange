The physiological roles of cellular
thioesterases are centered on the catalyzed hydrolysis of thioester
metabolites to their corresponding organic acid and thiol components.
Thioesters are prevalent in the cell wherein they serve as activated
forms of organic acids in a wide range of anabolic and catabolic chemical
pathways. Thioesterases act on the thioester precursors, intermediates, or
products of such pathways; alternatively,
they perform supportive roles as proofreaders, housekeepers,, or regulators.,

Thioesterases belong primarily to the hotdog-fold or α,β-hydrolase-fold
protein superfamilies., The hotdog-fold thioesterases
possess a characteristic core structure consisting of a 5-turn α-helix
cradled by a curved, 5-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. Dimerization forms an elongated β-sheet
and two active sites located at opposite ends of the subunit interface.
The topology of the substrate-binding site restricts catalytic activity
to thioesters in which the thiol unit is coenzyme A (CoA) or a phosphopantetheine-functionalized
acyl carrier protein (holoACP). In contrast, the substrate range covered by the thioesterase
family of the α,β-hydrolase-fold protein superfamily also
includes cysteine-linked thioesters (e.g., palmitoylated proteins).

The largest family within the hotdog-fold
protein superfamily is
comprised of thioesterases, principally because of the large demand
for thioester hydrolysis in the cell. The prevalence of the hotdog-fold
thioesterase family, in particular, suggests high evolvability, meaning
that the hotdog-fold scaffold readily takes on new functions. It is
well-known that substrate promiscuity is a key factor in the rapid
gain of novel biological function (for a recent review of this topic,
see ref ()). The
intrinsic promiscuity of a hotdog-fold thioesterase can be revealed
through determination of its substrate specificity profile by in vitro
substrate activity screening. Herein, we examine the substrate specificities
of a pair of hotdog-fold thioesterase family paralogs,Escherichia coli YbdB and YdiI, to discover
that although they are intrinsically promiscuous, they display high
catalytic efficiency for, and discrimination between, their respective
physiological substrates (viz., aberrant aroyl-holoEntB thioesters sometimes formed as dead-end
adducts during enterobactin biosynthesis,, and 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA formed as an intermediate
of the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway,−). In addition, we used bioinformatic methods to identify and map
the biological ranges of YbdB and YdiI orthologs and site-directed
mutagenesis to evaluate potential sequence markers. In the companion
paper, we report on the structure and
mechanism E. coli YbdB and YdiI.

Materials and
Methods
The restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, oligonucleotide
primers,
and the competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were purchased
from Invitrogen. Pfu Turbo and Deep Vent DNA polymerases were purchased from Strategene. The cloning vectors
were from Novagen. DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA Sequencing
Facility of the University of New Mexico. Acetyl-CoA, benzoyl-CoA,
propanoyl-CoA, hexanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA,
and oleoyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. The thioester substrates
4-hydroxybenzyol-CoA, 3-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA,
3-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA, and coumaroyl-CoA were synthesized as previously
reported.,E. coli strains JW1676
(ΔydiI::kanr) and BW25113 (wild-type)
of the Keio collection were obtained from Yale University. The engineered E. coli strain
DK574, carrying the plasmid pJT93 expressing the E. coli AcpS transferase gene, under tac-promoter control,
was a kind gift from Dr. John Cronan of the University of Illinois.
The holoACP (UniProt accession code P0A6A8) purified
from this strain was converted to benzoyl-holoACP by using the chemical
procedure reported in ref (). The molecular mass and purity of the isolated adduct were
verified by ES-MS analysis.

Growth Curve Measurements for Wild-Type and ydiI-Knockout E. coli Strains
Aerobic growth
curves were carried out in sterile vented flasks (Nalgene) each containing
50 mL of M9 minimal media supplemented with 4% glucose as the sole
carbon source, and with or without added kanamycin. An aliquot of
a liquid culture of JW1676 (ydiI-knockout strain)
or BW25113 (wild-type strain) E. coli cells grown
overnight in LB broth was added to the media to an initial A600 ∼ 0.01. Cultures were incubated at
37 °C with orbital shaking at 180 rpm. The culture A600 was determined at 1 h intervals for 14 h. Anaerobic
growth curves were measured in a similar fashion using 50 mL of M9
minimal media supplemented with double the amount of phosphate and
with 4% glucose plus 4% fumarate. The sterile flasks were capped with
sterilized stoppers and purged for 2 min with N2 gas passed
through a sterile 0.2 μm in-line filter. Aliquots were removed
by syringe, hourly over a 12 h period, for A600 determination.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of
C-terminus His-Tagged
YbdB and YdiI
The genes encoding YbdB (UniProt accession
code P0A8Y8) and YdiI (UniProt accession code P77781) were cloned by using a PCR-based
strategy in which genomic DNA prepared from E. coli strain K12 (substrain W3110) was used as template, commercial oligonucleotides
as the primers, and Pfu Turbo as the DNA polymerase.
The NdeI and XhoI-treated PCR product
was ligated, using T4 DNA ligase, to NdeI/XhoI sites
of pET-23a (Novabiochem) to give the plasmids, ybdB-His6/pET-23a and ydiI-His6/pET-23a. The resulting clones were
used to transform competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells
(Novagen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing
50 μg/mL of ampicillin. The cell culture was induced with 0.4
mM isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) once the
optical density had reached 0.6 (OD at 600 nm). Following an overnight
induction at 20 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 5000g for 15 min. The cell pellet was suspended
in 150 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, 10 mM imidazole, 1
mM DTT, and 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and passed through a French pressure
cell at 1200 psi before centrifugation at 48 000g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column
(2 cm × 11 cm), pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column
was washed at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with 150 mL of lysis buffer
followed by 100 mL of wash buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, 300 mM NaCl,
50 mM imidazole at pH 7.5). The His6-tagged proteins were
eluted with 90 mL of elution buffer (20 mM Tris·HCl, 300 mM NaCl,
250 mM imidazole at pH 7.5). The protein fractions were analyzed by
SDS-PAGE before pooling, concentrating, and dialyzing (50 mM Tris·HCl,
100 mM NaCl at pH 7.5). Aliquots of the protein solutions were frozen
for storage at −80 °C. Yield: ∼15 mg of His6-YbdB/g wet cell paste and ∼10 mg of His6-YdiI/g wet cell paste.

Preparation of YbdB and YdiI Site-Directed
Mutants
Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the
QuikChange PCR
strategy (Stratgene) and the ydiI-His6/pET-23a or ybdB-His6/pET-23a plasmid as template with commercial primers
and Pfu Turbo as the polymerase. The sequence of
the mutated gene was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The recombinant
mutant plasmids were used to transform competent E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells. The His6-tagged mutant proteins
YbdB M68V and YdiI V68M and F50A were purified to &gt;90% homogeneity
(as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis) as described above in a yield
of ∼10–25 mg protein/g wet cell paste.

Determination
of Steady-State Kinetic Constants
Thioesterase
activity was measured using a 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) coupled assay. Reactions were monitored at 412 nm (Δε
= 13.6 mM–1·cm–1) using a
Beckman 640U spectrometer. Reactions were carried out 25 °C with
0.5 mL solutions containing 50 mM K+HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM
DNTB, an optimal concentration of thioesterase, and varying concentrations
of the substrate (0.5Km to 5Km). The catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA in 50 mM K+HEPES (pH 7.5) was directly monitored at 300 nm (Δε
= 11.8 mM–1·cm–1). The initial
velocity data, measured as a function of substrate concentration,
were analyzed using Enzyme Kinetics v 1.4 and eq :where v is initial velocity, Vmax is maximum velocity, [S] is substrate concentration,
and Km is the Michaelis constant. The kcat was calculated from Vmax/[E] where [E] is the total enzyme concentration as determined
by the Bradford method.

Determination
of YbdB and YdiI pH-Rate Profiles for Catalyzed
4-HB-CoA Thioester Hydrolysis
The initial velocities of YbdB
and YdiI-catalyzed hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA, at varying concentration
(in the range of 0.5Km to 5Km), were measured at 25 °C (vide supra). The pH values
of the reaction solutions were maintained using 50 mM MES, HEPES,
TAPS, or CAPSO. Control reactions, in which the enzyme was preincubated
in the reaction buffer and then assayed at pH 7.5, were carried out
to detect possible inactivation at the pH extremes.

Bioinformatic
Analysis
BLAST searches of the sequenced
genomes deposited in NCBI were carried out using the Genomics Groups
BLAST server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/genom_table.cgi). The E. coli K12 YbdB and YdiI sequences were
used as queries, as were the sequences of the E. coli enterobactin and menaquinone biosynthetic pathway enzymes. Protein
sequence alignments were generated using COBALT (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/) and displayed in ESPrit3 (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php). Pathway gene context was determined
by browsing gene neighborhoods in PATRIC (http://patric.vbi.vt.edu/) and EnsemblBacteria (http://bacteria.ensembl.org/index.html). Homologs of the E. coli YbdB and YdiI were identified
for each bacterial phylum by carrying out BLAST searches of deposited
genomes, one genus at a time. E. coli YdiI and YbdB
homologs having &gt;35% sequence identity for &gt;80% sequence coverage
when aligned pairwise with the YdiI sequence are listed in Table SI1
of the . The genomes
of the order Enterobacteriales were examined one species at a time
using E. coli YbdB or YdiI as query in parallel BLAST
searches. We found one, two, or zero closely related sequence homologs
(viz., &gt;50% sequence identity for &gt;85% coverage) for each of
the 92
genomes. To distinguish between YbdB or YdiI orthologs, we compared
pairwise sequence identities (viz., homolog vs E. coli YbdB and homolog vs E. coli YdiI; higher sequence
identity associated with the orthologous pair) and we checked for
evidence of encoded enterobactin and menquinone pathway enzymes by
carrying out BLAST searches using the sequences of the respective
pathway enzymes as queries.

Results and Discussion
pH Dependence
of YbdB and YdiI Catalytic Efficiency
The variation in kcat and kcat/Km values for YdiI and
YbdB-catalyzed thioester hydrolysis as a function of reaction solution
pH was measured for the purpose of defining the optimal pH range for
catalysis. 4-Hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (4-HB-CoA) was selected to serve as
the substrate in the pH rate profile determinations because it is
a highly active substrate for both enzymes (see Table ), and its reaction can be monitored directly and continuously
by measuring the decrease in solution absorbance (at 300 nm) associated
with the cleavage of its para-hydroxyphenyl-conjugated
thioester group. As illustrated in Figure , the kcat and kcat/Km values measured
for YbdB are maximal at or near neutral pH, whereas both drop at acidic
and at basic pH. This trend was also noted by Guo and co-workers for
YbdB-catalyzed 2-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA hydrolysis. The YdiI kcat/Km value decreases below pH 6.5 and above 8.5,
whereas the kcat value is relatively constant
above pH 6.5 but then decreases with decreasing pH.

The pH-dependences of YdiI and YbdB catalysis are similar but not
identical. The kinetic experiments reported below were carried out
at a solution pH of 7.5 because both enzymes are fully active and
stable at this pH, and the DTNB-based assay for continuous monitoring
via coupled reaction with the CoA thiolate anion could be used in
the determination of the substrate specificity profiles (see below).

YbdB and YdiI Substrate Specificity Profiles
The steady-state
rate constants kcat and Km were determined for YbdB- and YdiI-catalyzed hydrolysis
of a structurally diverse library of thioesters for the purpose of
evaluating selectivity toward the thiol moiety (CoA vs holoACP) and toward the acyl or aroyl moiety
(see Chart  for chemical structures). The
CoA thioesters represent various classes of metabolites, differing
in the size, shape, and polarity of the acyl/aroyl group. The acyl
carrier protein (ACP)-based thioesters were used to test recognition
of the holoACP of the E. coli fatty
acid synthetic (FAS) pathway and the holoACP domain of EntB of the E. coli enterobactin
synthetic pathway (Figure A).

Substrate Activity Screen
Summary of the E. coli enterobactin biosynthestic
pathway. (A) Ordering of the clustered genes encoding the steps of
the biosynthetic pathway (blue) and the genes encoding proteins involved
in enterobactin transport and function (black). The proofreading hotdog-fold
thioesterase YbdB gene is colored red. The chemical steps of the biosynthetic
pathway catalyzed by the enzymes isochorismate synthase (EntC), bifunctional
isochorismate lyase/aryl carrier protein (EntB), 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate
dehydrogenase (EntA), phosphopantetheinyltransferase component of
entobacterin synthase multienzyme complex (EntD), enterobactin synthase
component F (EntF), and 2,3 dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase (EntE). (B)
Depiction of the mischarging of EntB catalyzed by EntD or holoEntB catalyzed EntE, and the EntB-regenerating thioester
hydrolysis reaction (rescue) catalyzed by YbdB (aka EntH). In the
figure, “R” can represent any organic group.

The physiological substrate for YbdB (aka EntH)
is mischarged holoEntB,,, which
in principle can be formed by the phosphopantetheinyl transferase
(EntD)-catalyzed reaction of an acyl-CoA or aroyl-CoA (in place of
CoA) with EntB, or by the ATP-dependent holoEntB-catalyzed
aroylation with an aberrant (hydroxy)benzoate in place of the native substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate (Figure B). In our previous
study, YbdB was shown to be highly active
toward the enterobactin pathway intermediate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-holoEntB (kcat = 2.8 s–1, kcat/Km= 1.8 × 105 M–1 s–1) and toward the ring hydroxyl positional isomer 2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl-holoEntB (kcat = 3.7 s–1, kcat/Km= 1.4 × 105 M–1 s–1), whereas the
activity observed
toward lauryl-holoEntB was found to be significantly
lower (kcat = 0.1 s–1, kcat/Km= 6.3 × 102 M–1 s–1). Thus, the proofreading function of YbdB appears to be primarily
directed at stalled aroyl-holoEntB adducts. We also
showed that benzoyl, 3-hydroxybenzoyl, and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA are
highly active YbdB substrates (kcat values
are 2.2, 1.2, and 1.6 s–1, and kcat/Km values are 1.8 ×
105, 3.4 × 104, and 7.6 × 104 M–1 s–1) as are 3-hydroxyphenylacetyl-CoA and coumaryl-CoA (kcat values are 2.1 and 0.82 s–1, and kcat/Km values are 5.7 × 104 and 8.4 × 104 M–1 s–1) (Table ). In contrast, the small acyl-CoA thioesters tested (acetyl-,
propionyl-, β-methylcrotonyl-, and β-methylmalonyl-CoA)
showed minimal or no detectable substrate activity with YbdB, and
the short-to-medium chain length (C6-C12) fatty acyl-CoA thioesters
displayed low turnover rates (kcat range
0.03–0.1 s–1) and low kcat/Km values ((5–6) ×
102 M–1 s–1) (Table ). The longer chain (C14–C18) fatty acyl-CoA
thioesters also displayed low turnover rates (0.03–0.09 s–1) but had modestly improved kcat/Km values ((2–7) ×
103 M–1 s–1) (Table ). Together the results indicate that YbdB recognizes
CoA, as well as holoEntB, as the thioester thiol
moiety, and that aroyl- and phenyl-substituted acyl moieties are targeted
whereas purely aliphatic acyl moieties are not. Hydroxylation of the
substrate benzoyl ring does not appear to have a significant impact
on activity.

Given that YbdB is compatible
with both CoA and holoEntB as the substrate thioester
moiety, we were curious to learn
whether YbdB can distinguish between different cellular ACPs. Thus,
the benzoyl adduct of the holoACP which functions
in E. coli fatty acid synthesis was prepared for
testing. In contrast to the cases of benzoyl-CoA and (hydroxy)benzoyl-holoEntB, benzoyl-holoACP (kcat = 0.013 s–1, kcat/Km= 2.2 × 102 M–1 s–1) proved to be a very
poor substrate (Table ), thereby indicating
that the YbdB substrate binding site is selective for the ACP domain
of EntB.

As will be detailed in the section that follows, the
physiological
substrate of E. coli YdiI is the menquinone pathway
intermediate 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA, (Figure ). We were therefore particularly interested in
comparing the catalytic efficiency of YbdB and YdiI with this substrate.
Whereas the YdiI activity with 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA proved to
be high (kcat = 1.6 s–1, kcat/Km = 2.0 × 105 M–1 s–1), the YbdB activity was quite low (kcat = 0.009 s–1, kcat/Km = 5.5 × 102 M–1 s–1). Conversely, YdiI proved to be an ineffective
catalyst for the hydrolysis of the holoEntB adducts
2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl-holoEntB, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-holoEntB, and lauryl-holoEntB. Only 2,4-dihydroxybenzoyl-holoEntB was hydrolyzed, and this took place at a very slow
rate (kcat = 0.0036 s–1, kcat/Km = 1.8 × 101 M–1 s–1). YdiI catalyzed the hydrolysis of the benzoyl-holoACP (FAS) (kcat = 0.083 s–1, kcat/Km = 1.5 × 103 M–1 s–1), yet at an efficiency
that is two orders of magnitude lower than that observed with the
corresponding CoA thioester, benzoyl-CoA (kcat = 17.7 s–1, kcat/Km = 7.1 × 105 M–1 s–1).

Menaquinone biosynthetic pathway. (A) The ordering
of the clustered
genes in the genome of Teredinibacter turnerae T7901 is shown to illustrate the colocation of the ydiI with the pathway genes which is found in some bacterial species
but does not occur in E. coli. (B) Reaction steps
of the E. coli pathway catalyzed by upper pathway
enzymes isochorismate synthase (MenF), 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate
synthase (MenD), 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2, 4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate
synthase (MenH), o-succinylbenzoate synthase (MenC), o-succinylbenzoic acid:CoA ligase (MenE), naphthoate synthase
(MenB), 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA thioesterase (YdiI), and lower
pathway enzymes 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyltransferase (MenA)
and ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase (MenG).

Next, we tested the level of promiscuity
that YdiI exhibits toward
aroyl-CoA and acyl-CoA thioesters. Although YdiI was not active toward
acetyl-CoA, a modest level of activity was observed with propionyl-CoA
(kcat = 0.21 s–1 and kcat/Km = 1.7 ×
103 M–1 s–1) and the
small, polar acyl-CoA thioesters tested, namely, β-methylcrotonyl-CoA
and β-methylmalonyl-CoA (kcat =
0.50 s–1 and 0.67 s–1; kcat/Km = 7.3 ×
103 M–1 s–1 and 5.8
× 103 M–1 s–1,
respectively) (Table ). The YdiI kcat/Km values measured for
the short-to-long chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesters (C6-C18) (0.14–4.1
× 105 M–1 s–1),
on the other hand, were observed to be in the same range as the kcat/Km values measured
for coumaroyl-CoA (2.8 × 105 M–1 s–1), benzoyl-CoA (7.1 × 105 M–1 s–1), and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA
(5.8 × 105 M–1 s–1). However, the YdiI kcat values determined
for the fatty acyl-CoA thioesters (range of 0.12–0.74 s–1) are significantly lower than the kcat values measured for the phenyl ring-containing substrates
(range of 5.2–17.7 s–1). A similar trend
is observed with the YbdB kcat values
(Table ). This finding suggests that productive
binding is more likely to occur with an aroyl-thioester substrate
than an acyl-thioester substrate. The structural basis for this discrimination
is provided in the companion paper.

In summary, the comparison of the YbdB and YdiI substrate specificity
profiles reveals that both thioesterases are (i) promiscuous, (ii)
most active with benzoyl- and phenylacyl-based thioester substrates,
and (iii) significantly more active with a CoA-based thioester substrate
than with the corresponding FAS holoACP-based substrate.
On the other hand, YbdB is highly active with EntB-based thioester
substrates (kcat/Km ∼ 1 × 105 M–1 s–1), whereas YdiI is not (kcat/Km &lt; 20 M–1 s–1), and conversely, YdiI is highly active with 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA
(kcat/Km =
2.0 × 105 M–1 s–1) and fatty acyl-CoA thioester substrates (kcat/Km ∼ 1 × 105 M–1 s–1), whereas YbdB
is not (kcat/Km = 5.5 × 102 M–1 s–1 and kcat/Km ∼ 1 × 103 M–1 s–1, respectively).

YdiI Biological Function
The findings
from the gene
neighborhood analysis reported in the section which follows revealed
that only in some taxomic groups of bacteria the YdiI/YbdB homolog
gene is colocated with all (see, e.g., Figure A which depicts the ydiI gene neighborhood within
the genome of Teredinibacter turnerae T7901) or a partial set (e.g., species of Bacteroides()) of the genes encoding the menaquinone
pathway enzymes. In E. coli, for example, ydiI is not colocated with the genes that support menaquinone
synthesis. To demonstrate that YdiI is an essential catalyst for menaquinone
synthesis in E. coli, the ydiI gene
knockout mutant was subjected to two lines of investigation. First,
Guo et al. showed that napthoquinone production in this mutant was
significantly reduced as compared to the parent strain. Second, in the present work, we measured the
growth curves for wild-type E. coli cells and for
the ydiI gene knockout mutant cells under conditions
requiring anaerobic respiration. By serving as an electron transporter,
menaquinone supports anaerobic respiration in facultative anaerobes
such as E. coli. Precedent for our experiment is
provided by previous work wherein it was shown that the disruption
of menaquinone synthesis in E. coli via mutation
of pathway gene menB or menD had
no apparent impact on cell growth under aerobic conditions, whereas
these mutant strains did not grow on glucose in the presence of fumarate,
the ultimate electron acceptor, under anaerobic conditions. As shown in Figure ,
the growth curves measured for wild-type E. coli K12
and the ydiI-knockout mutant grown on glucose under
aerobic conditions are essentially identical. On the other hand, the
comparison of the growth curves measured for wild-type E.
coli K12 and the ydiI-knockout mutant grown
anaerobically in the presence fumarate indicates that growth of the
mutant cells is significantly inhibited (Figure ). Thus, as in the case of the menaquinone pathway genes menB and menD, ydiI is
required for growth under oxygen-limited conditions. Indeed, the NCBI
GEO Profiles for YdiI reflect a significant increase observed in the
expression of ydiI in E. coli cells
grown under oxygen-limited conditions.

Comparison
of the growth curves measured for E. coli wild-type
(black circle) and the E. coli gene knockout
mutant ΔydiI (red circle) on glucose as the
carbon source under aerobic conditions and for E. coli wild-type (black down triangle) and the E. coli gene-knockout mutant ΔydiI (red down triangle)
on glucose in the presence of fumarate under anaerobic conditions.

Together with the high kcat/Km value of
2 × 105 M–1 s–1 measured for YdiI-catalyzed conversion of
1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA to 1,4-dihydroxynapthoate, these findings
provide convincing evidence that YdiI mediates an essential step of
the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway of E. coli.

Bioinformatic Analysis of the Divergence of the YbdB and YdiI
Ortholog
Tracking
To identify homologs to E.
coli YdiI and YbdB, BLAST searches of bacterial proteomes
were carried out. In Table , we list the number
of species per phyla and the percent sequence identity shared with
the E. coli YdiI (see Table SI1 of the  for an expanded list that
gives statistics for each bacterial species). We discovered that the
YdiI/YbdB homologs (as defined by sharing 35% or greater sequence
identity) are spread throughout evolutionarily diverse bacterial phyla
(viz., Acintobacteria, Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi, Chlamydiae, Firmicutes,
and Proteobactia) and that only the genomes of certain species of
the genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae (order Enterobacteriales;
class Gammaproteobacteria) encode two such homologs (see Table ).

Listed under
the column heading
“no.” is the number of YbdB and YdiI sequence homologs
found having sequence identities &gt;50% over &gt;85% coverage. Reported
under the column heading “thioesterases” are the sequence
identities determined for the single homologs aligned separately with
the E. coli YbdB and YdiI, and listed within the
respective parentheses. In cases of two homologs, the reported sequence
identity reflects that determined using the most homologous E. coli sequence. Ortholog assignment is indicated by bold
font. The term “nor” is used to indicate that function
not known, and ortholog assignment is not made. The column headings
“Ent genes” and “Men genes” denote the
presence of probable orthologs to the three diagnostic enterobactin
pathway genes (entB, entF, and entD), represented as B, F, D, and to the three diagnostic
menaquinone pathway genes (menD, menB, and menE), represented as D, B, E, respectively.
An absent gene is represented using “X”. The probable
orthologs were identified by BLAST searches of the individual proteomes
using the respective E. coli pathway enzyme sequences
as query, coupled with the criteria of &gt;40% pairwise sequence identity
for &gt;85% coverage. See text for description of residue 68. See

Posited
to function as proofreader
in in chrysobactin biosynthetic pathway

The E. coli EntF
shares ∼40% identity with this homolog labeled “f”,
which is a component of the biosynthetic pathway leading to the nonribosomal
peptide pyoverdine.

To assign
biological function to the Ybdb/YdiI homologs, we carried
out additional BLAST searches using as queries the E. coli MenB, MenD, and MenE sequences to detect the menaquinone pathway,
and the E. coli EntB, EntD, and EntF sequences to
detect the enterobactin pathway. The occurrence
of the enterobactin pathway enzymes was restricted to certain species
of the Enterobacteriaceae family, each of which possesses two Ybdb/YdiI
homologs (see Table ). On the other hand,
the menaquinone pathway enzymes were found to be encoded by the genomes
of most, yet not all, of the species that encode one or two Ybdb/YdiI
homologs (Table SI1 of the  and Table ).

Pursuant of our original
goal to correlate divergence of YbdB/YdiI
homolog function with the divergence of structure, we now take an
in-depth look at the homologs within the Enterobacteriaceae family.
In Table , we list the sequence identities
of each YbdB/YdiI homolog with the E. coli YdiI and
YbdB. Homologs, which share greater identity with the E. coli YdiI, than with the E. coli YbdB, are viewed as
closer in lineage to the former than to the latter. In Table , we also list the “score cards” for
the presence versus absence of the diagnostic enzymes of the menaquinone
and enterobactin pathways. In all but a few species (described below),
we found that either all three enzymes of the pathway are present
or none are, and based on this information we inferred the biological
function of the homolog. With only a few exceptions, which are addressed
below, the predicted lineage and biological function support the assignment
of each homolog as ortholog to E. coli YdiI versus
YbdB.

Specifically, the single YbdB/YdiI homolog found in species
of
the genera Edwardsilla, Enterobacteriacea (sp. B9254FAA only), Monganella, Proteus, Providencia, Rahnella, Photorhabudus, and Yershina (pestis KIM10+, intermedia, and enterocoltica only) has the highest sequence identity with the E. coli YdiI, and it is accompanied by the menaquinone pathway enzymes and
not the enterobactin pathway enzymes. These particular homologs are
assigned as E. coli YdiI orthologs (indicated in
Table  by use of the bold font). Two YbdB/YdiI
homologs are found in species of the genera Citrobacter, Cronobacter, Eschericia, Samonella, Raoultella, Shigella, Shimwella, Enterobacteriacea, Enterobacter, and Klebsilla as are the
respective sets of three diagnostic enzymes of the menaquinone and
enterobactin pathways. In each case, the YdiI ortholog and YbdB ortholog
can be clearly distinguished on the basis of the relative sequence
identities with the E. coli paralogs.

Exceptions
to the two scenarios presented above are attributed
to the absence of one or more of the diagnostic menaquinone or enterobactin
pathway enzymes. The genome of Pantoea ananatis LMG
5342, for instance, encodes a single YbdB/YdiI homolog, which shares
equal (viz., 62%) sequence identity with the E. coli YdiI and YbdB, yet the genome does not encode the enzymes of the
menaquinone or enterobactin pathway. The lineage and biological function
are thus undefined. The genome of Serratia symbiotica, on the other hand, encodes pathway enzymes EntB, MenD, and MenB
only, and a single YbdB/YdiI homolog, which shares 67% sequence identity
with E. coli YdiI versus 54% with E. coli YbdB. In contrast, the other species Serratia listed
in Table  possess all three (diagnostic) menaquinone
pathway enzymes, yet only homologs to the enterobactin pathway enzymes
EntB and EntF. The single YbdB/YdiI homolog produced in these species
shares greater sequence identity with the E. coli YdiI (72–74%) than with the YbdB (54%). These data support
the ortholog assignment YdiI for Serratia species marcescens, odorifera, plymuthica, proteamaculans, sp. AS12, and sp. D9; however,
the function of the homolog from Serratia symbiotica remains undefined. The conservation of the EntB and EntF homologs
among these species raises the possibility of the existence of an
alternate siderophore biosynthetic pathway, which does not employ
a YbdB-like housekeeper (i.e., EntB proofreader). An analogous scenario
exists for two species Xenorhabdus bovienii, which
possesses homologs to MenD, MenB, and MenE (hence, the menaquinone
pathway) as well as to EntB and EntF (suggestive of a possible pathway
leading to an alternate siderophore), and Xenorhabdus nematophila, which conserves the three diagnostic menaquinone pathway enzymes,
but lacks the EntB and EntF homologs. As with Xenorhabdus
bovienii, Brenneria sp. EniD312 possesses
a single YdiI/YbdB homolog, which is most closely related in sequence
to that of the E. coli YdiI (vs YbdB), and the three
diagnostic menaquinone pathway enzymes plus the homologs to the E. coli EntB and EntF. Whereas we do not know the identity
of the pathways that the EntB and EntF homologs of Serratia, Xenorhabdus, and Brenneria serve,
the biosynthetic pathway leading to the nonribosomal peptide pyoverdine
is the likely home of the EntB and EntF homologs of Pectobacterium. The represented species of Pectobacterium possess
the menaquinone pathway in which the single YdiI/YbdB homolog, which
is most closely related in sequence to that of the E. coli YdiI (vs YbdB), is predicted to function. In summary, the YdiI/YbdB
homologs of Serratia, Xenorhabdus, and Brenneria are assigned as YdiI orthologs.

Notably, the two representative species of the genus Dickeya synthesize chrysobactin in place of
enterobactin. The two siderophores are structurally similar; both
contain 2,3-dihydoxybenzoate and l-serine modules. Chrysobactin
biosynthesis utilizes homologs to the enterobactin pathway synthases
EntB and EntF, and we might expect that one of the two encoded YdiI/YbdB
homologs has a proofreading role in chrysobactin biosynthesis similar
to that performed by the E. coli YbdB in support
of enterobactin biosynthesis. This YdiI/YbdB homolog is significantly
more distant from the E. coli YbdB (57% sequence
identity) than are the assigned YbdB orthologs (&gt;80% sequence identity)
(Table ). The other YdiI/YbdB homolog of Dickeya shares 64% sequence identity with the E.
coli YdiI and is predicted to function in the encoded menaquinone
pathway, consistent with its assignment as an ortholog to the E. coli YdiI.

The species of the genus Yersinia show the greatest
variation with regard to their utilization of the YdiI/YbdB homolog.
For instance, we did not find a homolog encoded by the genomes of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, rukeri, and massiliensis, or by the genomes of Yersinia pestis biovar microtus str. 91001 and medievalis str.
harbin 35. On the other hand, the YdiI/YbdB homolog, which is most
closely matched with the E. coli YdiI (68–70%
sequence identity), coexists with the menaquinone pathway in Yersinia pestis KIM10+, intermedia, and enterocoltica and is thus assigned as a YdiI ortholog. The
YdiI/YbdB homologs of Yersinia aldovae, bercovieri, and mollaretii are missing MenB, and all three
enterobactin pathway enzymes. Yersinia frederikseni and kristensenii are missing MenB and EntD. The
higher sequence identity of these homologs with the E. coli YdiI (vs YbdB) suggests their lineage; however, their functions
are not defined.

Gene Context
The genes encoding
the proteins involved
in the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, the assembly of enterobactin,
as well as its transport and cleavage are clustered on the E. coli genome along with ybdB (see Figure ). The ybdB orthologs of other
species of Enterobacteriaceae (Table ) are
also clustered with enterobactin pathway genes (see Figures SI1 and
SI3 of the ). Interestingly,
the genes encoding the chrysobactin pathway proteins in Dickeya
dadantii (and zea) are likewise clustered
with the gene encoding the homolog to the YbdB of the enterobactin
pathway ().

Oddly, the
genes encoding the menaquinone pathway in E. coli are not colocated with ydiI (Figure ). Instead, located downstream of the YdiI gene is a gene
(ydiJ in E. coli) which encodes
a large (1018 amino acids) multidomain protein annotated in EcoGene
as a FAD-linked, 4Fe-4S cluster-containing oxidoreductase of unknown
function. Located upstream is the suf operon, the
protein products of which function in Fe-S cluster assembly under
conditions of iron starvation or oxidative stress (Figure ). This gene context is
largely conserved within Enterobacteriaceae; however, outside this taxonomic group, the gene context is highly
varied, and numerous examples can be found where YdiI and the menaquinone
pathway genes are colocated (see Figure  and
Figures SI2 and SI4 of the ).

YbdB and YdiI Sequence Markers
Based on the respective
three-dimensional structures reported in the companion paper, we identified amino acids 15, 68, and 71 as points
of divergence in the respective E. coli YbdB and
YdiI active site regions that accommodate the substrate aryl/alkyl
group. For E. coli YbdB versus YdiI, the residues
are Thr15 versus Met15, Met68 versus Val68, and Phe71 versus Tyr71,
respectively. To determine if these residues are conserved, the amino
acid sequences of the YbdB orthologs derived from Enterobacteriaceae
species (Table ) were aligned, as were the
YdiI orthologs. The resulting multiple sequence alignments are shown
in Figures SI5 and SI6 of the . The YbdB sequence alignment reveals high conservation of Met68
and Thr15 and conservative replacement of Phe71 (with Tyr or Trp).
Two outliers are the YbdB homologs of the Dickeya zeae and dadanti, which are presumed to function in
the chrysobactin biosynthetic pathway. These homologs share 60% pairwise sequence identity with the E. coli YbdB and possess Met15, Val68, and Trp71. A third
outlier is the YbdB homolog of Shimwellia blattae (74% pairwise sequence identity with E. coli YbdB),
as it possesses Met15, Met68, and Phe71. The residue at position 15
in YdiI is variable (the E. coli YdiI Met15 is replaced
with polar residues as well as nonpolar residues), the E.
coli YbdB Val68 is conservatively replaced with Met, Leu,
or Ile, and the Tyr71 is stringently conserved. Notably, the strict
conservation of YdiI Tyr71 is not required for efficient catalysis
as revealed by the high (wild-type level) activity of the YdiI Y71A
mutant (Table ).

Despite some variation in the
identity of the amino acid at position
68 in YdiI, based on structural considerations, we posit that this
position is most closely linked to substrate binding. Specifically,
the structures of the E. coli paralogs (see the companion
paper) show that Met68 in YbdB and Val68
in YdiI are located at the back of the alkyl/aryl binding pocket.
To examine the importance of these residues to substrate recognition,
the “residue-swapped” site-directed mutants YbdB M68V
and YdiI V68M were prepared, and subjected to steady-state kinetic
analysis (see Table  for the kinetic constants).
The substrates tested with these mutants are benzoyl-CoA (highly active
substrate for both YbdB and YdiI), 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA (highly
active substrate for YdiI but not YbdB), and lauroyl-CoA (highly active
substrate for YdiI but not YbdB). The kcat/Km values measured for YbdB M68V and
YdiI V68M catalyzed-hydrolysis of benzoyl-CoA are essentially the
same as those measured for the wild-type enzymes. In contrast, the kcat/Km value measured
for YbdB M68V with 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA serving as substrate
(2.7 × 104 M–1 s–1) is 47-fold larger than that measured with wild-type YbdB. The kcat/Km value measured
for YdiI V68M with 1,4-dihydroxynapthoyl-CoA serving as substrate
is essentially unchanged. With lauroyl-CoA serving as substrate, the kcat/Km determined
for YdiI V68M is reduced ∼10-fold in value whereas the kcat/Km value measured
for YbdB M68V (4.5 × 103 M–1 s–1) is increased ∼10-fold. Thus, the comparatively
lower catalytic efficiency of YbdB with the larger alky- and aryl-substituted
substrates can be explained, at least in part, by the steric constraints
imposed by the Met68.

Conclusion
We have shown that the
biological range of YbdB is restricted to
species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, whereas that of YdiI extends
well beyond this, to other divisions of Proteobacteria as well as
to other phyla (see Figure ). The high overall
sequence identity between E. coli YbdB and YdiI (59%)
indicates that they are paralogs. Whereas YdiI is found in the vast
majority of represented Enterobacteriaceae species, either alone or
in combination with YbdB, the occurrence of YbdB is more restricted
and coincides with that of YdiI. Indeed, whereas the siderophore enterobactin
is unique to Enterobacteriaceae species, the electron acceptor menaquinone
is required by a wide range of facultative anaerobes, including most
species of Enterobacteriaceae. Thus, a reasonable scenario is that
YbdB evolved within Enterobacteriaceae via divergence of an ancestral
gene possibly following its duplication or horizontal transfer.,

function (cyan).

The YbdB and YdiI substrate
specificity profiles (Table ) show that both
enzymes possess a high level of
promiscuity, which promotes evolvability but, at the same time, increases
the danger of unwanted hydrolysis of off-target thioester metabolites.
As a safeguard, transcription of the YdiI and YbdB genes should be
tightly regulated. In fact, the entCEBA-ybdB operon is under the control of the entCp promoter,
which is repressed by the transcriptional regulator protein Fur when
the iron concentration in the cell is adequate. Bouveret and co-workers have shown that the production
of YbdB in E. coli is induced by iron starvation. Although the mechanism of transcriptional regulation
of the menaquinone pathway genes, including ydiI,
has not yet been reported, it has been shown that the level of ydiI transcription is significantly elevated during anaerobic
growth of E. coli cells on fumarate, conditions which require menaquinone production.

The specialization of biological function in YdiI and YbdB is clearly
supported by their divergence in substrate recognition. The aroyl-binding
site of YbdB does not accept the napthoyl group, which we have shown
for the E. coli enzyme can be attributed, at least
in part, to Met68. Conversely, YdiI does not recognize EntB, and this
suggests that there are important differences in the structures of
the respective regions that accommodate the CoA nucleotide in both
enzymes, and the EntB in YbdB only. To gain insight into the structural
determinants, which support the divergence in YbdB and YdiI substrate
specificity, the X-ray structure determinations reported in the companion
paper were carried out.

Terminology: Paralogous genes are
created by a gene duplication event, whereas orthologous genes are
genes in different species that originated by vertical descent from
a single gene of the last common ancestor. Orthologous genes may or
may not be functionally equivalent.

In this paper, the term “holo” is
used to specify that the ACP serine residue
is functionalized with a phosphopantetheinyl group.

This observation is different from
that reported by Guo and co-workers. We
are not aware of the reason for the difference in substrate activity
patterns.

The enzymes were
selected as the most
diagnostic of the respective pathways because of the uniqueness of
the reaction catalyzed (i.e., not common to other pathways) and/or
their distinct structure (viz., no close sequence homologs having
different functions).

The
significance, if any, of the
YdiI gene context (viz., ydiJ, ydiI, ydiH and the suf operon) conserved
among the among Enterobacteriaceae host species is unclear. However,
it might be more than a coincidence that the gene neighborhood encodes
a Fe-S cluster-dependent oxido-reductase, as well as Fe-S cluster
assembly proteins, which are called into action when iron metabolism
is disrupted.

Whereas the E. coli cells genetically engineered to overexpress ybdB showed inhibited growth upon iron starvation, the cells
genetically
engineered to overexpress YdiI did not. This suggests that YbdB will, at an abnormally high concentration,
overtake EntF. Thus, strict regulation of the amount of YbdB present
relative to the amount of EntF is to be expected.
