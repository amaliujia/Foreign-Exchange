Ribonucleic acids (RNA) are
important biological molecules that have a variety of functions, including
catalysis,, regulation of gene expression,, and use as a template for reverse transcription. The function of RNA is often dictated by its structure,
and loops are an important component of structure.

The secondary
structure of an RNA can be predicted with thermodynamic
parameters from the nearest neighbor model, and predictions are reasonably
accurate when constrained by experimental data.− UV melting experiments
with RNAs have revealed a variety of stabilizing and destabilizing
structures. One destabilizing structure is a hairpin loop composed
of only cytidine. Groebe and Uhlenbeck showed that hairpin loops composed
of only cytidine are more destabilizing that the respective adenosine
and uridine hairpin loops. This led to
a penalty in nearest neighbor parameters for homocytidine loops., One possible reason for the destabilizing effect is that single-stranded
oligocytidylic acid is unusually structured, making folding into the
hairpin more thermodynamically unfavorable.

Polycytidylic acid
(polyC) has been studied by numerous techniques.− An X-ray fiber diffraction study revealed that at neutral pH, polyC
is a right-handed helix with a C3′-endo sugar pucker and base
stacking. A later nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) study concluded that polyC in solution is a left-handed helix
without base stacking and stabilized by direct hydrogen bonding between
the carbonyl and amino groups of adjacent bases. Temperature jump experiments showed that stacking and unstacking
in polyC and CpC occur on the time scale of 100 ns.−

In this
paper, UV melting shows that the hairpin formed by r(5′GGACCCCCGUCC), termed HPC4, is less stable than
r(5′GGACUUUUGUCC), termed HPU4. NMR spectra reveal that r(CCCC) has an A-form-like folded-state
structure with C3′-endo sugar puckers, an anti orientation
of bases relative to their sugars, and base–base stacking.
The NMR data provide benchmarks for testing recent revisions to torsion
parameters, in the parm99, force field,
which is commonly used for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations of RNA. For this purpose, the NMR results are compared
to predictions from 1500 ns MD simulations with parm99,, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR force fields. The rapid rate of conformational
changes allows several transitions during the simulation time, so
that simulations can be started far from the expected average structure
and have the possibility of finding structures consistent with NMR
spectra. The results indicate that revisions in parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR force
fields improve the modeling of RNA, but further revisions are necessary.

Materials and Methods
UV Melting
The oligoribonucleotides r(5′GGACCCCCGUCC) and r(5′GGACUUUUGUCC) were purchased from Dharmacon Inc. and deblocked according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNAs were then purified
by PAGE on a 20% gel.

Thermodynamic parameters were measured
in 10 mM MOPS, 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.0), and a salt concentration varying
between 5 and 2000 mM for NaCl, 10 and 1000 mM for KCl and LiCl, or
2 and 20 mM for MgCl2. Absorbance versus temperature melting
curves were measured at 260, 270, and 280 nm with a heating rate of
1 °C/min, forward and reverse, from 5 to 99 °C on a Gilford
Response spectrophotometer. Typical melting curves were measured over
a 10-fold range of oligonucleotide concentrations. Melting temperatures
were independent of concentration, consistent with hairpin formation.

Thermodynamic Analysis of Hairpin Formation
Thermodynamic
parameters were obtained using MeltWin, which assumes a two-state model. Melting curves were fit to the
following equations:where A is the absorbance, f is the fraction of strands in a hairpin, AF is the absorbance of folded species, AU is the absorbance of unfolded species, εF and εU are the extinction coefficients for the
folded and unfolded species, respectively, CF and CU are the concentrations
of the folded and unfolded species, respectively, L is the path length of the cell, mF and mU are the slopes for the temperature dependence
of extinction coefficients of the folded and unfolded species, respectively, bF and bU are the
corresponding intercepts, ΔH° is the standard
enthalpy change, and ΔS° is the standard
entropy change. The six parameters fit are bF, bU, mF, mU, ΔH°,
and ΔS°.

NMR
r(CCCC) was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. The NMR
sample consisted of 3.2 mM r(CCCC) in 80 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate
(pH 7.0), and 0.5 mM EDTA. Two deuterium exchanges with 99.9% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories) were performed on the
sample followed by a final exchange with 99.990% D2O (Sigma
Aldrich).

Nonexchangeable proton assignments were made from
two-dimensional (2D) NOESY, 1H–31P HETCOR, 13C–1H HMQC, and TOCSY spectra collected
at 5 °C with a Varian Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Table S1
of the ). NOESY spectra
were recorded with mixing times of 200, 400, and 800 ms and were 31P-decoupled. Acquisition parameters are listed in Table S2
of the . NMR spectra
were processed with NMRPipe and analyzed
with SPARKY. Chemical shifts for the
H5′ and H5″ protons were assigned by assuming the higher
and lower chemical shifts are H5′ and H5″ resonances,
respectively. The H5′ and H5″ labels are those used
in AMBER.,

Generation of Starting Structures for Molecular Dynamics Simulations
of r(CCCC)
Starting structures of r(CCCC) for MD were generated
with the nucgen program in AMBER9. Four
different starting structures were used: A-form (C3′-endo/anti),
C3′-endo/syn, C2′-endo/anti, and C2′-endo/syn,
where C3′-endo and C2′-endo represent possible sugar
puckers and anti and syn represent possible glycosydic bond torsions.
The C3′-endo/syn structure was generated with Avogadro 1.1.0 by manually rotating the four torsions to an
approximate syn value (Table S3 of the ). C2′-endo/anti and C2′-endo/syn
structures were generated by simulated annealing. Sufficient simulated
annealing calculations were performed so that the structure would
fit the desired torsion and pseudorotation phase angle constraints
for each starting structure, with each succeeding simulation starting
from the previous one. The generalized Born implicit solvent model− with a salt concentration of 1 M was used in the simulated annealing
protocol. A 20 Å cutoff for long-range nonbonded interactions
was used. The velocity limit was set to 10. Berendsen temperature
control with a coupling time of 1 ps
was utilized in all simulated annealing calculations. Distance and
torsion restraints of 32 kcal mol–1 Å–2 and 32 kcal mol–1 rad–2, respectively,
were applied with square bottom wells with parabolic sides, which
forced the structure into the intended starting structure. Starting
backbone torsions measured with Pymol are presented in Table S3 of the . Torsion angle definitions were taken from Murray
et al. Figure  shows the atoms defining torsions. AMBER input files and starting
structural coordinates (PDB format) are provided in the  (Tables S4–S11).

and d-ribose. (C) Hairpin formed by r(5′GGACCCCCGUCC), termed HPC4.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations of r(CCCC)
AMBER9’s
tleap program was used to generate starting structures neutralized
with three Na+ ions, and solvated in an
8.65 Å truncated octahedral box with 1215 TIP3P water molecules. The system was minimized by steepest descent
for 500 steps and then minimized by conjugate gradient descent for
another 500 steps. Periodic boundaries were used, and Cartesian restraints
were activated. Long-range interactions were not calculated past 10
Å. To keep the RNA immobile, a 500 kcal/mol restraint was placed
on all residues. After minimization of the solvent, the entire system
was minimized by steepest descent for 1000 steps and then minimized
by conjugate gradient descent for 1500 steps, which were otherwise
identical to those of the first minimization routine.

The RNA
was then kept fixed for a 2 ns MD run using a 2 fs time step. Minimization
was turned off; nonbonded interactions beyond 10 Å were neglected,
and periodic boundaries were activated. The initial temperature was
set to 0 K, so the velocities were calculated from the forces. The
temperature was gradually increased from 0 to 275 K through 100000
steps. Langevin dynamics with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps–1 was used. The system was again equilibrated for 100
ps at 275 K. After minimization, the non-A-form starting structures
had already moved toward A-form.

Production runs were conducted
with a 3 fs time step at 278 K using
particle mesh Ewald (PME), with a 10 Å nonbonded
cutoff, a constant pressure, isotropic position scaling, a 2 ps pressure
relaxation time, and no position restraints. To test if energy is
conserved with a 3 fs time step, 2 and 3 fs time steps were simulated
for 100 ns. There were no anomalous energy spikes observed in either
simulation (Figure S1 of the ). SHAKE was used to provide constraints
of bonds involving hydrogen. All simulations were run for 1500 ns,
which allows for several conformational changes. Restart files were
saved every 0.3 ns, and the trajectory was written every 0.15 ns.
The same random seed number generator was used for each restart. To
counteract potential problems, identified by Cerutti et al., the simulations were restarted at long (∼100
ns on average), uneven time intervals. For comparison to NMR results,
the MD results were averaged from these trajectories.

Calculation of Experimental Values
The 3J scalar coupling values were measured from peak
splittings in the NMR spectra. An error of ±0.5 Hz was assumed
for scalar couplings of &gt;1.0 Hz. Distances were calculated from
measured
NOE volumes using eq .where rNOE is
the NMR distance between protons i and j, NOEij is the volume for an NOE peak
between protons i and j, and c is an average constant determined from NOEij H1′–H2′ cross-peaks of C1
and C3 and H1′–H4′ cross-peaks of C2 and C3 assuming
corresponding distances of 2.75 and 3.29 Å, respectively. The
H1′–H2′ and H1′–H4′ distances
are assumed to be consistent because there is no observable splitting
of the C1–C3 H1′ resonances (Figure S2 of the ), indicating that C1–C3
are in the C3′-endo sugar conformation. The more commonly used
H5–H6 distance was not used as a reference because of zero
quantum coherence, which results in reduction of NOE peak volumes,
sometimes even leading to negative NOE volumes.

The 200 ms mixing
time NOESY spectrum was used for all NMR cross-peak volume measurements.
Because r(CCCC) is small, 200 ms includes the linear range for NOE
buildup. Comparison of NOE cross-peak volumes for the 200 and 400
ms mixing time NOESY spectra (Table S12 of the ) gave a ratio of 1.8, consistent with
200 ms being in the linear buildup range. Error limits on NMR distances
were calculated fromwhere cSD is the
standard deviation in the average c and Verr is the standard deviation calculated from 12 volumes
of spectral noise (areas with no NOEs). Table S12 of the  contains the peak volumes,
average c values, cSD values, noise volumes, and the noise standard deviation (Verr) used in this paper.

3J scalar coupling values predicted
from MD were calculated from torsion angle trajectories. Each torsion
angle was converted to a 3J scalar coupling
using equations from Marino et al. (Table S13 of the ) and then
averaged to give the MD-predicted 3J scalar
coupling. The average “distances” predicted by MD, rMD, were calculated from interproton distance
trajectories:where rMD is the distance between two protons averaged over n snapshots, i, of the trajectory.

C3′-endo and C2′-endo conformations predicted by
MD were defined by pseudorotation phase angle ranges of 0–36°
and 144–180°, respectively. Anti, high anti, and syn conformations were defined by torsion angle,
χ, ranges of 180–239°, 240–300°, and
0–120°, respectively.

A-Form distance values are the average of distances measured from
four CC doublets in the A-form duplex structure, COPY19 RNA, entry 1QC0() as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The A-form torsions were obtained in a similar
fashion.

for a wide range of salt conditions (Tables S14 and S15 of the ). Values of ΔG°37 in 2–20 mM Mg2+ are
similar to those in 1 M NaCl.

NMR
3J1′–2′ scalar coupling constants from one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR spectra of r(CCCC) revealed that all residues prefer a C3′-endo
sugar pucker from 0 to 70 °C (Tables  and  and Tables S16 and S17 and Figure S2
of the ). Figure  shows the NOESY walk region from a 2D 1H–1H spectrum. The intranucleoside H6–H1′
cross-peaks for C1, C2, and C4 are weak compared to the intranucleoside
H6–H5 cross-peaks, implying that the bases are anti relative
to the ribose (Tables  and ). In addition, the volume of the peak containing overlapped
cross-peaks from H6 to H1′ of C3 and from H6 to H5 of C2 is
also smaller than expected if C3 was syn relative to the ribose. NOEs
between C2 H6 and C1 H2′, C3 H6 and C2 H2′, C4 H6 and
C3 H2′, and C4 H6 and C3 H3′ (Figure ) are consistent with A-form base stacking. Because of the
overlap between C3 H6 and C2 H6 and between C2 H2′ and C2 H3′,
however, the stacking between C2 and C3 cannot be evaluated quantitatively.
Chemical shifts of the phosphorus resonances are all within 0.3 ppm,
indicating that there is no significant deviation from accepted A-form
RNA backbone torsions (Figure S3 of the ).

between C3 H6 and C4 H2′ indicates a population of r(CCCC)
where the 3′ sugar is inverted.

Parentheses indicate distances taken
from 0 to 770 ns. After 770 ns, C1 intercalates between C3 and C4.

CC doublets in PDB entry 1QC0.

In a 200 ms NOESY spectrum, C3 H6–C4 H2′
and C3 H3′–C4
H2′ cross-peaks correspond to distances of 4.00 and 3.32 Å,
respectively, which suggests a population with the C4 sugar inverted
because A-form distances would range
from 7.91 to 9.15 Å and from 6.38 to 7.62 Å, respectively
(Table ). Sugar inversion has been observed
previously,− but is rare. An approximate percentage of terminal
sugar inversion can be calculated by comparing the cross-peak volumes
of C3 H2′–C4 H6 and C1 H2′–C2 H6 cross-peaks
because sugar inversion increases the distance between Cn H2′ and Cn+1 H6 to &gt;5 Å. If the
cross-peak
volume for the C3 H2′–C4 H6 cross-peak is assumed to
be zero when the sugar is inverted, then the population of inverted
terminal sugars is approximately 13% at 5 °C.

Broido and
Kearns proposed a left-handed helix for polyC caused
by a large H5–H1′ NOE corresponding to a distance of
2.3 Å. Figure S4 of the  shows that C4 has no significant peaks corresponding to H5–H1′ NOEs
in a 200 ms NOESY 31P-decoupled spectrum.

Dynamics of the Initial A-Form r(CCCC) Structure in MD Simulations
with the parm99, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR Force Fields
Figures S5 and S6 of the  and Figure  show 1500 ns trajectories for
the heavy atoms and backbone rmsds, χ dihedrals, and δ
dihedrals, respectively, for all cytidines in the parm99,, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR force field simulations with an A-form starting
structure. The 1500 ns simulation with the parm99 force field shows
rapid fluctuations (Figure S5 of the ). The χ torsion for C1 in parm99 makes frequent
transitions between syn (∼45°) and high anti (∼265°).
C2–C4 have a few transitions to syn but stay high anti for
most of the simulation (Table ). For all the
cytidines, the δ dihedral shows frequent transitions between
C2′-endo (140–152°) and C3′-endo (78–90°)
(Table  and Figure S5 of the ).

Time evolution (in nanoseconds) for the
minimized A-form starting
structure of r(CCCC) with the parm99TOR force field. The top two plots
show the rmsds of the heavy atoms for the whole structure and of the
backbone, respectively, relative to A-form r(CCCC). After 770 ns,
C1 intercalates between C3 and C4. The remaining plots correspond
to the χ and δ dihedral angles for each residue. δ
dihedral angles of 78–90° and 140–152° correspond
to C3′-endo and C2′-endo sugar puckers, respectively. Anti, high anti, and syn conformations were
defined by χ dihedral angles of 180–239°, 240–300°,
and 0–120°, respectively.

With the parm99χ_YIL force field simulation
(Table  and Figure S6 of the ), C1–C4 are anti (180–239°),
with a few transitions to high anti. C1–C3 are largely C3′-endo,
with a few C2′-endo transitions, but C4 has rapid fluctuations
between C2′-endo and C3′-endo (Table  and Figure S6 of the ).

With the parm99TOR force field simulation, C1 intercalates
between
C3 and C4 after 770 ns (Table  and Figures  and ) and fluctuations
in the rmsd plots significantly decrease. The intercalation is stabilized
by C1 base stacking with C3 and C4. There is no NMR evidence of this
conformation (Figure ). parm99TOR, with an
A-form starting structure, was thus evaluated for the first 770 ns
in addition to the whole trajectory (Tables  and  and Figure ). C1 is anti and C3′-endo with a few fluctuations to high
anti and C2′-endo; C2 and C3 are anti and C3′-endo without
fluctuations, and C4 is anti, with a few syn and high anti transitions,
and has rapid fluctuations between C2′-endo and C3′-endo.
Interestingly, the intercalation of C1 between C3 and C4 after 770
ns is not accompanied by any clear changes in χ or δ (Figure ).

The time period evaluated for MD
simulations was chosen from the point at which simulations show reasonable
agreement with the NMR distances and expected torsion angles until
a structure inconsistent with NMR data is observed or the simulation
reaches its end. Reasonable agreement with the NMR distances and expected
torsion angles is defined as 60% agreement with the 27 NOEs within
error limits (Table ), three β dihedrals
(between 150° and 210°), and four γ dihedrals (between
40° and 80°).

Simulations started as A-form and
were evaluated for the entire simulation unless otherwise noted.

Simulations did not show reasonable
agreement with the NMR distances and expected torsion angles, so these
trajectories were not evaluated.

Only the first 770 ns was used because
after 770 ns, C1 intercalated between C3 and C4.

After 597 ns, C1 intercalated between
C3 and C4.

Dynamics of Non-A-Form r(CCCC) in MD Simulations with the parm99,
parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR Force Fields
Figure  shows the heavy atom rmsd trajectories relative
to an A-form (C3′-endo/anti) structure for production runs
with C3′-endo/syn, C2′-endo/anti, and C2′-endo/syn
starting structures and parm99, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR force
fields. The evaluation of these simulations was started at the first
point at which the simulations show an A-from-like structure as defined
by reasonable agreement with NMR distances (Table ) and expectations for torsion angles based on ranges observed in a crystal structure (PDB entry 1JJ2) of 23S and 5S rRNA. Reasonable agreement with NMR distances
and expectations for torsion angles was defined as greater than 60%
agreement for the combination of 27 NOEs within error limits (Table ), three β torsions (between 150° and
210°), and three γ torsions (between 40° and 80°).
Figures S8–S16 of the  show additional details. Structures at the time points for starting
analysis are shown in Figure S17 of the .

Time evolution (in nanoseconds) of the heavy atom rmsd
of the simulations
of non-A-form starting structures relative to A-form r(CCCC) for each
force field. In both the C3′-endo/syn and C2′-endo/syn
starting structures in the parm99 force field, C1 stacks on C4 forming
a looplike structure after 656 and 931 ns, respectively. Around 600
ns for the C3′-endo/syn starting structure with the parm99χ_YIL
force field, C1 intercalates between C3 and C4.

All the parm99 trajectories with non-A-form starting
structures
do not agree with the NMR data (Table ), so
these trajectories were not evaluated. The C3′-endo/syn and
C2′-endo/syn simulations for parm99 form looplike structures
with C1 and C4 (Figure S18 of the ) stacked with amino and carbonyls overlapping after 656 and 931
ns, respectively.

With parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR, the
MD for non-A-form starting
structures were evaluated from the time they show an A-form-like structure
until a structure inconsistent with NMR was generated or the simulation
ended (Table ). With parm99χ_YIL, base
intercalation of C1 between C3 and C4 occurs after 597 ns for the
C3′-endo/syn starting structure so only the time range from
65 to 597 ns was analyzed. Evidently, this base intercalation is not
unique to the parm99TOR force field. Table S17 of the  shows the percentage of
C3′-endo and percentage of anti for the entire simulation for
each parm99χ_YIL non-A-form starting structure simulation.

The three non-A-form starting structures for parm99TOR reached
reasonable agreement with NMR distances and expectations for torsions
only after 290, 1093, and 991 ns (Table )
and were then evaluated until the end of each 1500 ns simulation.
The percentage of C3′-endo and percentage of anti for each
1500 ns non-A-form starting structure simulation are listed in Table
S17 of the .

Comparison of NMR to MD Simulations
Several criteria
can be used to benchmark force fields. One criterion is the length
of time a starting structure, known to be accurate, is maintained
during MD simulations.− Another is comparison of structural details determined
by crystallography or NMR with those predicted by MD.,−,, The rapid transitions between structures of unpaired RNAs−, allow another test, namely, whether
a force field generates a realistic structure if a starting conformation
is unrealistic. The results presented here allow all three types of
comparisons. Because force fields for RNA are not perfect, however,
it is necessary to choose the time intervals in MD simulations that
will provide the most insights into force field performance (Table ). For example, if the starting structure is very
inconsistent with NMR spectra, then our comparisons include only those
MD time intervals after a structure is generated that is A-form-like.
If, after a structure relatively consistent with NMR spectra is generated,
unrealistic structures are generated, then the simulations are evaluated
with and without the unrealistic data (Tables  and  and Tables S18–S23 of the ). For the MD simulations
reported here, the unrealistic structures involve base stacking by
intercalation or loop formation (see the footnotes of Table , Figures  and , and Figure S18 of the ). To use as much simulation data as possible for
a given force field, results conforming to the conditions described
above were combined to give an “extended MD” for comparison
to NMR data. For example, with parm99TOR, segments were combined from
0 to 770, 290 to 1500, 1093 to 1500, and 991 to 1500 ns of C3′-endo/anti,
C3′-endo/syn, C2′-endo/anti, and C2′-endo/syn
simulations, respectively, to give a total of 2896 ns (Table ). The total “extended time” for parm99χ_YIL
was 4975 ns. For parm99, only the C3′-endo/anti simulation
was used because the non-A-form starting structure simulations never
reached good agreement with NMR data. Kinetic studies of polyC indicate
that stacking and unstacking are largely noncooperative with half-lives
of roughly 40 and 300 ns, respectively, at 5 °C. Because there are three possible stacks to break in r(CCCC),
the extended A-form (C3′-endo/anti) simulations for the parm99TOR
and parm99χ_YIL force fields allow more than 20 and 40 such
transitions, respectively. This is illustrated in plots of the distance
between Cn N3 and Cn+1 N3 versus
time (Figures S19 and S20 of the ).

To allow comparisons to torsion angles generated by MD simulations, 31P-decoupled and 31P-coupled 2D NOESY spectra were
used to measure 17 3JH–H and nine 3JH–P coupling
constants (Table ). The measured 3J coupling constants were compared to torsion angle
predictions from MD by converting predicted torsion angles to predicted 3J coupling constants using a best-fit Karplus
relation (Table S13 of the ). To determine the accuracy of the
MD predictions, the calculated values were compared to the NMR-measured 3J coupling values ±0.5 Hz (Figure A). The average difference between MD-calculated 3J scalar coupling and the NMR-measured 3J scalar coupling is shown in Figure B. Tables S18–S20 of the  show the values of the NMR-measured
and MD-predicted 3J scalar couplings for
each force field.

Comparisons between MD-predicted and NMR-measured 3J couplings (top) and distances (bottom).
The top bar graph
in each panel summarizes the results from simulations starting from
an A-form structure (Tables  and ). The bottom bar graph (Extended MD) in each panel
adds to A-form starting structure simulations the results obtained
from simulations starting with non-A-form structures in the time range
after reaching an A-form-like structure and before any base intercalation.
Table  details the portion of each simulation
used for comparison. For parm99, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR,
the total Extended MD time is 1500, 4975, and 2896 ns, respectively.
The Extended MD simulation data for parm99 are the same as the C3′-endo/anti
simulation data because of the non-A-form starting structure simulations
not forming an A-form-like structure. parm99 (green), parm99χ_YIL
(red), and parm99TOR (blue) force fields were tested. (A) Percentage

the error limits of the measured NOEs. (D) Average of the absolute
values of differences between MD-predicted distances and NMR-measured
NOEs. Tables S18–S23 of the  show the MD-predicted and NMR-measured values used
in these plots.

To allow comparisons to distances generated by
MD simulations (Figure C), 27 interproton
distances were calculated from
NOEs measured in a 200 ms mixing time NOESY spectrum (Table ). The upper and lower limits used in the NOE comparison
were calculated as described in . In Figure D, the average difference between
the measured NOE distance and the predicted MD distance is shown for
each force field. Tables S21–S23 of the  list the measured NMR NOEs and the
predicted MD distances for each force field.

As mentioned previously,
NMR indicates the terminal sugar is inverted
∼13% of the time. For simulations with A-form (C3′-endo/anti)
r(CCCC), parm99, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR force fields predict
27, 2, and 5%, respectively.

Discussion
Modeling the sequence dependence of folding
is important for predicting
RNA structure.,,− Cn hairpin loops are
consistently less stable than other loops, and structure in “unfolded” Cn regions could account for the relative instability. For example,
on the basis of NMR, it has been suggested that polyC forms a left-handed
helix. Moreover, polyC stacks at 37 °C, whereas polyU is unstacked., In fact, polyC stacking at 37 °C is even more favorable than
stacking in polyA as quantified by equilibrium constants of 1.7 and
0.88, respectively, in 0.05 M sodium cacodylate., Here, UV melting studies provide additional evidence of the reduced
stability of a C4 hairpin; NMR provides insight into structural
features of the isolated C4 oligonucleotide, and comparison
between NMR spectra and MD simulations tests our understanding of
interactions determining RNA structure.

UV Melting of C4 and U4 Hairpins Suggests
Revision of the Penalty for C4 Loops in 1 M NaCl
In Table , the difference in ΔG°37,HL between C4 and U4 hairpins in 1 M NaCl is 1.30 kcal/mol. This contrasts with
the ΔΔG°37,HL of 3.8
kcal/mol calculated from the data of
Groebe and Uhlenbeck for hairpins formed
by r(pppGGGAUACY4GUAUCCA), where ppp is triphosphate and
Y is C or U. A ΔΔG°37,HL of 0.8 kcal/mol has been reported by Shu and Bevilacqua between C3 and U3 hairpins
at 10 mM NaCl. With different stems, Groebe and Uhlenbeck measured
a ΔΔG°37,HL of 1.4 kcal/mol
for C3 and U3 hairpins in 10 mM Na+. Interestingly, the difference in ΔG°37 between C4 and U4 hairpin formation is 0.68 and 0.92 kcal/mol in 5 mM NaCl and 10
mM KCl, respectively, buffered at pH 7.0 with 10 mM sodium MOPS and
0.1 mM sodium EDTA (Table ). This is within
experimental error of the difference of 0.8 kcal/mol measured for
the C4 and U4 hairpins by Groebe and Uhlenbeck
in 10 mM Na2PO4 at pH 7.0. The results may reflect a non-nearest neighbor interaction,
possibly because of a length dependence for counterion condensation.− All the comparisons agree, however, that Cn loops are relatively unstable and therefore should be penalized
when predicting RNA secondary structure. While the penalty for C3 and C4 hairpin loops should perhaps be reduced,
it will still disfavor such hairpins, which have not been seen in
libraries of known RNA secondary and three-dimensional structures.,

NMR Spectra Are Consistent with C4 Being Largely
a Right-Handed A-Form-like Helix at pH 7
In NMR spectra of
C4, H6–H1′ cross-peaks for C1, C2, and C4
indicate that the ensemble average has each base in the anti conformation
relative to the ribose. A-Form base stacking is consistent with the
presence of NOEs between C2 H6 and C1 H2′, C3 H6 and C2 H2′,
C4 H6 and C3 H2′, and C4 H6 and C3 H3′. Chemical shifts
of the phosphorus resonances are within 0.3 ppm of each other, indicating
no significant deviation from accepted A-form RNA backbone torsions.
Figure S4 of the  shows a lack of a large H5–H1′ cross-peak expected
for a left-handed helix. Thus, the C4 NMR data are consistent with a right-handed A-form-like helix
at neutral pH. This is in agreement with X-ray fiber diffraction data
for polyC.

Tables  and  compare 3J scalar coupling constants and NMR distances with those
from CC nearest neighbors in the crystal structure of an A-form duplex. Approximately 85% of the values agree between
NMR and A-form. While NMR indicates the nucleosides in C4 are C3′-endo/anti with NOE peak volumes consistent with base
stacking, the moderate agreement between the NMR and A-form distance
and 3J scalar coupling constants suggests
that on average C4 is not exactly A-form, but rather A-form-like
(Tables –).
For example, C4 is apparently inverted roughly 13% of the time. The
NMR of C4 is consistent with the “unfolded”
state having significant structure. The fact that some or all of this
structure has to be broken to form a hairpin loop agrees with the
weaker folding of HPC4 relative to HPU4 because
adjacent unpaired U residues do not form structure, even in polyU.,

The Thermodynamics of Hairpin Folding Is Consistent with U4 Being Less Structured in the Unfolded State and More Structured
in the Hairpin Loop Relative to C4
In general,
folding of U4 hairpins is associated with a more favorable
ΔH° and a less favorable ΔS° relative to those of C4 hairpins (Table ). NMR reveals that the nucleotides are stacked
in C4, as expected on the basis of optical melting and
kinetic experiments with polyC., Presumably, U4 is a random coil, as is polyU., Thus, at least
one stacking interaction must be broken in C4 to allow
the 180° backbone turn required for a C4 hairpin,
but no such interaction is broken in the formation of a U4 hairpin. Moreover, NMR indicated that a hydrogen-bonded UU pair
forms at the base of a U4 hairpin loop.

parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR Improve the Agreement between
NMR and MD Simulations
Predictions from MD simulations with
the parm99 force field show the least agreement with NMR data (Tables –). While the NMR
spectra are consistent with an ensemble of A-form-like conformations,
the parm99 force field prefers a C2′-endo sugar pucker and
a high-anti base orientation., Figure  shows the performance of force fields in predicting the percent
of correct 3J scalar coupling and distances
and the average absolute differences between the MD predictions and
NMR data. The parm99 force field shows the poorest performance, and
with the non-A-form starting structures, a final A-form-like structure
is never reached. parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR perform similarly
to each other (Figure ).

With the parm99χ_YIL
and parm99TOR force fields, all of the non-A-form starting structures
eventually reach an A-form-like structure in reasonable agreement
with NMR spectra. This suggests that the four 1500 ns simulations
provide sufficient sampling for comparison of the three force fields.
For each non-A-form starting structure, parm99χ_YIL reaches
A-form-like significantly faster than parm99TOR. The times taken for
non-A-form starting structures to reach A-form-like structure after
minimization for parm99χ_YIL are 65, 35, and 22 ns for C3′-endo/syn,
C2′-endo/anti, and C2′-endo/syn, respectively, compared
to 290, 1093, and 991 ns, respectively, for parm99TOR. A-Form-like
conformations are not always stable, however (Figures  and ).

The parm99χ_YIL
force field has revised parameters only for
the χ dihedral, whereas parm99TOR also adds revised parameters for the β,
ε, and ζ torsions along with the parmbsc parameters for the α and γ torsions. Both parm99χ_YIL
and parm99TOR are improvements over parm99 for prediction of NMR data,
but the results do not indicate improvement from the additional reparametrizations
included in parm99TOR.

parmOL is
a recent force field not
tested in the experiments reported here. The parmOL force field includes
revisions to the χ,, α, and γ
tosions. parmOL and parm99χ_YIL
performed similarly when tested with folded RNAs., Because parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR perform similarly on r(CCCC)
and tetramer duplexes, revised parameters
for α, β, γ, ε, and ζ torsions likely
make little difference. Thus, parmOL simulations are likely to be
similar to those with parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR. The results
provide consensus that revisions to χ parameters provide major
improvements to parm99.,,,,

Comparison of Backbone Scalar Couplings among the A-Form Reference,
NMR, and MD Predictions
NMR scalar couplings can be compared
to couplings expected for the standard A-form and to MD predictions
for each of the force fields averaged over all β, γ, and
ε torsion angles when starting with C3′-endo/anti structure
(Table ). The A-form reference structure has an average β dihedral angle of 165.6°,
corresponding to the β trans conformation. This angle predicts
average 3J scalar coupling values of 5.0
and 1.4 Hz for all n P–n H5′
and n P–n H5″ torsions,
respectively (Table S13 of the )., NMR 3J scalar
couplings are an average of 3.8 and 0.9 Hz for n P–n H5′ and n P–n H5″ torsions, respectively, corresponding to a β angle
of ∼188° (Table  and Table S13
of the )., Average predicted 3J scalar couplings
are 3.2, 3.7, and 4.5 Hz for n P–n H5′ torsions and 2.9, 2.3, and 2.8 Hz for n P–n H5″ torsions for parm99, parm99χ_YIL,
and parm99TOR, respectively (Table ). These 3J scalar couplings correspond to β
torsions of ∼178°, ∼173°, and ∼167°
for parm99, parm99χ_YIL, and parm99TOR, respectively (Table  and Table S13 of the )., Both NMR-measured and MD-predicted
β dihedral angles are still within the range associated with
the trans conformation.

Calculated from the measured n P–n H5′ and n P–n H5″ 3J couplings (Table  and Table S13 of the ) using the relations φ
= β + 120° and φ′ = β – 120°,
respectively, where φ and φ′
are the n P–n H5′
and n P–n H5″ torsions,
respectively. An error of ±0.5 Hz was assumed in the 3J couplings leading to a torsion angle range of
186–192°.

Approximated

and n H4′–n H5″
torsions having 3J couplings of ∼2

(Table  and Table S13 of the ), respectively, corresponding to a
gauche+ conformation. An error
of ±0.5 Hz was assumed in the 3J couplings
leading to a torsion angle range of 55–65°.

The lack of C1–C3 H1′
peak splitting observed in the 1D spectrum (Figure S2 of the ) indicates a C3′-endo
sugar pucker, so the accepted δ
range for C3′-endo is used.

Calculated from the measured 3J couplings (Table ) using the relation ψ = ε + 120° for n H3′–n+1 P torsions, where ψ is the n H3′–n+1 P torsion. An error of ±0.5 Hz was assumed in the 3J couplings leading to a torsion angle range
of 237–241°.

Calculated directly from the MD
δ torsion trajectory for C1–C3.

From X-ray fiber studies on polyC.

X-ray fiber results
indicate a C3′-endo
sugar pucker, but no specific δ
torsion angle; therefore, an accepted range for the δ torsion
in a C3′-endo sugar pucker is used.

In the NMR spectra, the 3J scalar coupling
constants for H4′–H5′ and H4′–H5″
cross-peaks, which are representative of the γ torsion, were
∼2 and ∼1 Hz, respectively (Table ). This corresponds to the γ torsion residing completely in
the gauche+ orientation, i.e., a torsion angle of ∼60°
(Table  and Table S13 of the ),, which is consistent
with the A-form reference structure. The
average MD predictions from the γ trajectory for parm99, parm99χ_YIL,
and parm99TOR are ∼73°, ∼69°, and ∼69°,
respectively, for γ (Table ). MD predictions
are averages that result from γ torsions that fall within g+, g–, and trans conformations, but g+ accounts for ∼85% of the angles in the trajectories.
The three force fields provide reasonable predictions of γ even
though only parm99TOR contains the γ torsion parameters developed
by Perez et al. to disfavor the rarely
seen trans conformation.

In the NMR spectra, the n H3′–n+1 P 3J scalar coupling constant
has an average of 9.1 Hz (Table ), which is
consistent with an ε torsion angle of ∼239° (Table  and Table S13 of the )., The A-form reference structure has an average ε dihedral angle of ∼210°
calculated from four CC doublets, corresponding to an n H3′–n+1 P 3J scalar coupling constant of 8.2 Hz. Average MD predictions are ∼5.5,
∼8.8, and ∼6.2 Hz for parm99, parm99χ_YIL, and
parm99TOR, respectively (Table ), corresponding
to ε angles of ∼219°, ∼218°, and ∼201°,
respectively (Table  and Table S13 of the )., An ε dihedral angle of 231° has been observed in X-ray
fiber diffraction studies of polyC.

Even though the average MD-predicted backbone torsion angles are
in agreement with A-form ranges, the
small differences in torsion angles cumulatively lead to a large backbone
deformation. Panels A and B of Figure  compare
representative parm99χ_YIL and parm99TOR backbones with the
nucgen backbone, which is representative of the A-form. This backbone
deformation causes the large rmsds of the MD simulations relative
to an A-form reference structure.

Structures of r(CCCC) representative of
those with typical rmsds
relative to A-form and aligned with nucgen A-form structure (black)
in panels A and B by aligning residue C1 in both structures: (A) parm99χ_YIL
(green), (B) parm99TOR (red), and (C) parm99χ_YIL aligned with
parm99TOR. These alignments were generated with PyMOL using the align function.

Areas in Which MD Force Fields Can Be Improved
Comparisons
between NMR spectra and MD simulations of unpaired oligonucleotides
provide benchmarks for testing force fields.,, Comparisons of simulations for r(GACC) and r(CCCC) indicate that revision of torsion
angle parameters improves AMBER simulations relative to parm99. Comparisons
of thermodynamic integration calculations with measured differences
in stabilities of tetramer duplexes with GC or isoGisoC base pairs
also showed improvement. Several results,
however, suggest that further revisions of the force field are necessary.

A striking difference between NMR spectra and the parm99TOR MD
simulation starting with A-form and parm99χ_YIL starting with
C3′-endo/syn is the persistence of base intercalation in the
simulations. NMR spectra lack NOESY cross-peaks expected for intercalations.
In both simulations, C1 intercalated between C3 and C4 after 600–800
ns and remained in this conformation until the end of the 1500 ns
simulation (Figures –). A similar stacking is observed in the parm99 force field
with C3′-endo/syn and C2′-endo/syn starting structures
when a looplike structure is formed by C1 stacking on C4 after 650–950
ns. These unique structures were stabilized by favorable stacking
interactions between amino and carbonyl groups (e.g. Figure E,F). Experimental studies of a similar stacking
interaction between the amino of cytosine and a carbonyl of uracil
showed this type of interaction is energetically favorable., Base intercalation was also observed in a parm99χ_YIL simulation
of the tetramer r(GACC), where G1 intercalated between C3 and C4 and
the structure was stable for ∼400 ns. This suggests that energy terms driving stacking may be too favorable,
as suggested by Banas et al. for A-tracts
in B-DNA. Such terms may include base–base and/or base–water
interactions. The NMR results for r(GACC) and r(CCCC) should be good benchmarks for testing future revisions
of RNA force fields.
