5-Methylcytosine (5mC) is an important epigenetic
modification
that serves as a marker for gene expression, X-chromosome inactivation,
and transposon silencing, among other developmental processes.− Abnormalities in the regulation of DNA methylation may lead to neuronal
disorders and cancer development., 5mC is generated
by a class of DNA methyltransferases that use S-adenosylmethionine
to methylate cytosine at position C5 by a relatively well characterized
mechanism. In contrast, the mechanism
of 5mC → C demethylation is less well understood. DNA demethylation
may occur passively after synthesis of unmethylated daughter strands
during replication or actively by enzymes that remove the methylated
base. Active demethylation has recently been linked to the base excision
repair (BER) pathway, which is normally associated with removal of
detrimental nucleobase modifications from the genome., BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove
a specifically modified nucleobase by cleaving the N-glycosidic bond
reviewed in refs (−). In mammals, 5mC may
be removed in two ways. In one pathway, activation-induced cytidine
deaminase (AID) converts 5mC to thymine, which is excised from the
resulting T/G mispair by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and MBD4.− Alternatively, 5mC is oxidized by ten eleven translocation (TET)
proteins to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC),
and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC).− Of these, 5fC and 5caC are substrates for TDG.,

In contrast to mammals, plants have evolved specific 5mC DNA
glycosylases
that remove DNA methylation.−Arabidopsis thaliana DEMETER (DME) functions during plant gametogenesis before fertilization
and is responsible for imprinting specific genes in the endosperm,
which is necessary for seed viability., DME demethylation
in the central and vegetative cells is also thought to produce small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) that guide methylation at transposons in
the egg and sperm cells, respectively.,Arabidopsis also contain three DME paralogs—Repressor
of Silencing 1 (ROS1), DME-like 2 (DML2), and DML3—which function
in adult cells as genome wide demethylases that remove 5mC marks at
sites 3′ and 5′ to genes.− Recent reports of DME activities indicate that the control of DNA
methylation can be utilized agriculturally to benefit crop production
and medically to develop therapies against celiac disease by suppressing
DME expression to produce wheat varieties lacking gliadins and glutenins
that cause immunogenic epitopes.−

The DME/ROS1/DML enzymes contain a conserved DNA glycosylase
domain
belonging to the helix-hairpin-helix [4Fe-4S] iron–sulfur cluster
superfamily. DME and ROS1 utilize a bifunctional
glycosylase/lyase mechanism to cleave the glycosidic bond and the
phosphodiester backbone through β,δ-elimination to create
a one-nucleotide gap in the DNA., DME/ROS1/DML
enzymes are much larger than other glycosylases, ranging from 1100
to over 1700 residues, and contain two additional domains (A and B)
with no known homology to other proteins (Figure A). Like the glycosylase domain, domains A and B are conserved
among the DME paralogs and are essential for DME function. Homology modeling of ROS1 predicted a bipartite
discontinuous glycosylase domain separated in sequence by an unstructured
interdomain region (IDR). All DME paralogs
contain an N-terminal lysine-rich region that in ROS1 is necessary
for binding long stretches of DNA in a methylation-independent manner.,

linker in DMEΔNΔIDR1. Numbers refer to amino acid positions
at the termini. (B) Homology model of DME constructed from the C-terminal

structure of Nth bound to THF-DNA (PDB ID 1P59), which was used as a template for homology
modeling. The location of the Domain A–Glycosylase junction
is indicated by the dotted circle. Functionally important residues
are represented as sticks (catalytic Lys1286, cyan; plug Asn778, magenta;

In contrast to ROS1, which has been the subject of several
biochemical
studies,− little is known about the molecular mechanisms of DME and DML enzymes.
Here, we investigated 5mC excision and substrate specificity of DME
and DML3 by mutational analysis. Residues that constitute DME’s
active site and DNA damage binding face were predicted from Endonuclease
III (EndoIII/Nth) homology modeling, and the importance of these residues
to DNA binding and 5mC excision tested. In addition, we previously
showed that DME is able to excise 5hmC, and we now extend this activity to DML3 and report a comprehensive
kinetic analysis of oxidized 5mC excision by DME and DML3. These results
provide new insight into the molecular underpinnings for 5mC specificity
and excision by the DME family of enzymes.

Materials and Methods
Protein
Expression and Purification
Arabidopsis thaliana DMEΔN (residues 678–1729)
and DMEΔNΔIDR1, in which residues 798–1188 were
replaced with the dodecapeptide AGSSGNGSSGNG, were overexpressed as
N-terminal His6-MBP-fusion proteins as described previously. The region encoding A. thaliana DML3 amino acids 334–1044 (DML3ΔN) was PCR-amplified
from full-length DML3 cDNA template using
primers 5′-AAT TGG ATC CGT AAC AAC GAT GAT CAA AGC) and 5′-AAT
TGA ATT CCT ATA TAT CAT CAT CAC TCA TAA AC. The PCR amplicon was digested
with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned
into the pET27 (Novagen) derived expression vector pBG102 (Vanderbilt
Center for Structural Biology), which produces a cleavable N-terminal
His6-SUMO-fusion protein. All constructs were transformed
into E. coli Rosetta2 (DE3) cells (Novagen)
and propagated in LB media to an OD of 0.5. Proteins were overexpressed
for 18 h at 16 °C upon addition of 0.1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested
by centrifugation at 6000 rpm and lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5,
500 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol with an Avestin Emulsifier C3 homogenizer
operating at ∼20 000 psi. The lysates were cleared by
centrifugation at 22 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Fusion
proteins were purified using Ni-NTA (Qiagen) affinity chromatography,
followed by cleavage of the affinity tag by PreScission Protease overnight
at 4 °C. The proteins were further purified by heparin-sepharose
(GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT,
0.1 mM EDTA, and a NaCl gradient (0.1–1 M), followed by gel
filtration on a 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM
EDTA. Protein was concentrated to 100–150 μM and stored
at −80 °C in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 40% glycerol,
0.1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM EDTA. Mutant proteins were prepared by site-directed
mutagenesis using a Quik-Change Kit (Stratagene) and purified in the
same manner as the wild-type proteins.

Glycosylase Activity Assay
Proteins were dialyzed in
reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1
mM EDTA) prior to use. Oligonucleotides of the sequence d(TGACTACTACATGXTTGCCTACCAT),
in which X is 5mC, 5hmC, 5fC, 5caC, or T, were synthesized with 6-carboxyfluoroscein
at the 5′ end by Integrated DNA Technologies (5mC and T) and
Midland Certified Reagents (5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC) and annealed to the
complementary strand containing G opposite base X. Enzyme (at least
10 μM for single-turnover conditions) was incubated with 100
nM duplex DNA at 25 °C in reaction buffer. For data shown in
Figure B, 2 μM protein (nonsaturating)
was used. Aliquots of 8 μL were removed from each reaction and
terminated with stop buffer (10 mM EDTA in formaldehyde with xylene
cyanol and bromophenol blue). Substrate and product DNA were separated
by gel electrophoresis with a 20% acrylamide gel in TBE buffer run
at 40 W for 1 h. Gels were imaged using a Typhoon Trio variable mode
imager and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Single-turnover
rate constants (kst) were determined by
exponential fit of the fraction product versus time. To establish
the apparent KM (K1/2) for each substrate, rate constants (kobs) were determined at varying enzyme concentrations,
and plots of kobs vs [E] were fit to the
equation, kobs = kst[E]/(K1/2 + [E]). Under nonsaturating
conditions, kobs is dependent on enzyme
concentration and is thus reported in units of M–1 s–1.

For inhibition experiments, the glycosylase
assay was carried out with 10 μM (5mC excision) and 2 μM
(T/G excision) DMEΔNΔIDR1 in the presence of varying concentrations
of unlabeled competitor DNA containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), a 1-nucleotide
gap, or thymine (T/G mismatch) in the central position. Gap-DNA was
assembled by annealing the two 12-mer oligonucleotide sequences flanking
the central position to the 25-mer opposite strand. To determine the
inhibitory effects of free 5mC or Thy base on 5mC excision, 10 μM
DMEΔNΔIDR1 was incubated with varying concentrations of
free base (0.01–31 mM) for 30 min prior to the addition of
100 nM fluorescein-labeled 5mC-DNA substrate. The Ki was determined by plotting kobs as a function of competitor DNA concentration and fitting the data
to the equation, kobs = kst[E]/(Ki + [E]).

DNA Binding
Oligonucleotides containing the same sequence
as above and a centrally located 5mC were annealed to complementary
strand containing 6-carboxyfluorescein at the 3′-end. Varying
concentrations of enzyme (0–100 μM) were incubated with
50 nM duplex DNA in reaction buffer for 10 min at 25 °C. Fluorescence
anisotropy was measured using a Biotek Synergy H1 hybrid multimode
microplate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and
538 nm, respectively. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by fitting the data to a two-state binding
model. Reported values are averages from three independent experiments.
Because DME reacts slowly, there is no significant product generated
within 10 min. Anisotropy values measured 0, 10, and 30 min after
addition of wild-type enzyme did not change.

DME Homology Model
A homology model of DME bound to
abasic-DNA was constructed using Swiss-Model and the structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus EndoIII/Nth (PDB ID 1P59()) as a template, similar
to that previously described for ROS1. The final model incorporated DME residues 737–796 of domain
A and 1217–1396 of the glycosylase domain. Protein–DNA
contacts were predicted using the coordinates of the tetrahydrofuran
(THF)-containing DNA from the Nth structure superimposed on the DME
model.

Results
Model for DNA Binding by
DME
Arabidopsis DME, ROS1,
DML2, and DML3 each contain three highly conserved domains
important for function (Figure A). The N-terminal
and interdomain regions (IDRs) have very low homology and little predicted
secondary structure. We previously showed that the three conserved
domains are necessary and sufficient for DME 5mC excision activity,
as constructs lacking the N-terminal 677 residues (DMEΔN) and
with the IDR1 replaced with a short dodecapeptide linker (DMEΔNΔIDR1)
retain activity. In order to quantify
the effect of IDR1 removal on enzymatic activity, we compared the
kinetics of 5mC excision of DMEΔNand DMEΔNΔIDR1
proteins. Under nonsaturating conditions, the observed rate constants
(kobs) of DMEΔNand DMEΔNΔIDR1
are 134 ± 9 M–1 s–1 and 43
± 1 M–1 s–1, respectively
(). Thus, removal of the 393-residue
region between domain A and glycosylase domain has only a 3-fold effect
on the rate of 5mC excision, which, under the conditions of this assay,
is not significant. However, deletion of IDR1 significantly improves
protein solubility, purity, and stability, mainly as a result of proteolytic
sensitivity of IDR1, making DMEΔNΔIDR1 more amenable to
biochemical analysis than DME or DMEΔN. Therefore, the DMEΔNΔIDR1
construct was used for the remainder of this study.

In order
to gain insight into the DME structural features important for 5mC
excision, we constructed a homology model of the glycosylase domain
using the structure of Bacillus stearothermophilus Nth, a closely related [4Fe-4S]-containing glycosylase specific
for oxidized purines. As reported previously for ROS1, the C-terminal region (residues 737–796)
of domain A is predicted to complete the helix-hairpin-helix glycosylase
fold based on its significant sequence conservation with the N-terminal
60 residues of Nth (Figure C). The conserved
regions place DME Phe796 (domain A) in close proximity to DME Asp1217
(glycosylase domain) such that IDR1 is excluded entirely and most
likely an independent domain. This aspect of the model is validated
by the retention of activity in the DMEΔNΔIDR1 mutant
and the inclusion of functionally important residues within the region
contributed by domain A. In addition,
the model places the catalytic Asp1304 and Lys1286 in close proximity
to the flipped abasic site. Substitution of either of these residues
(Asp1304Asn and Lys1286Gln) abrogates 5mC excision activity (Table ).

Activity is below limit of
detection.

Damage recognition
and catalysis by DNA glycosylases is facilitated
by extrusion of the target nucleobase inside an active site pocket.
This extrahelical conformation is stabilized by intercalating side
chains that plug the gap left by the flipped nucleobase and create
a wedge in the opposite strand to create a sharp kink in the DNA duplex.−,− Substitution of these intercalating
residues typically has a dramatic effect on glycosylase activity.
Our homology model predicts that Asn778 and Met1238 would serve as
the plug and wedge residues in DME (Figure C). Substitution of Met1238 with alanine in DMEΔNΔIDR1
abrogated 5mC excision activity and had no effect on DNA binding (Figures D and , Table ), consistent with results from the corresponding
residue (Met905) in ROS1 ()., Similarly, an Asn778Ala substitution had a 10-fold reduction in
activity relative to WT (Figure D, Table ). Interestingly, the corresponding substitution
in ROS1 (Asn608Ala) had no effect. Rather,
the neighboring ROS1 residue (Gln607) was found to be necessary for
5mC removal and duplex interrogation., In contrast,
substitution of this neighboring residue in DME (Gln777) with alanine
had only a 2-fold effect on 5mC excision and no effect on DNA binding
relative to wild-type (Figures D and , Table ). We also
tested these two putative plug residues in DML3ΔN by making
alanine substitutions corresponding to DME Gln777 and Asn778. In this
case, both DML3 Gln426Ala and Asn427Ala abrogated 5mC excision activity
(), suggesting that DME and DML3
utilize subtly different modes of damage recognition. Thus, we have
identified DME and DML3 residues from discrete domains as likely candidates
for duplex interrogation and/or stabilization of extrahelical 5mC.

Specificity of DME and DML3 for Oxidized 5mC
In mammals,
5mC is oxidized to 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC by TET proteins− (Figure A). We recently found that DME and
ROS1 have activity toward 5hmC. Although
we were unable to detect these derivatives in Arabidopsis, we compared their rates of excision by DMEΔNΔIDR1 and
DML3ΔN against 5mC and thymine from T/G-mismatches as a means
to understand the molecular basis for the unique 5mC specificity of
the DME family of enzymes. Under single-turnover conditions, DME exhibited
the same activity for T/G and 5hmC, with first-order rate constants
(kst) only 2–3-fold less than for
5mC excision (Figure B, Table ). Interestingly, the rate of 5caC excision was also 2-fold
less than 5mC (Table ), although the enzyme
was only able to process 20% of the substrate (Figure B), suggesting either a mixture of 5caC species (e.g., amino
and imino forms) was present in the DNA
or a product of 5caC excision inhibited the reaction. Under the same
conditions, DME was inactive toward 5fC (Figure B). DML3 excised 5mC 2-fold more slowly than DME and showed the same
general trend toward excision of oxidized 5mC derivatives (Figure C and Table ).

Enzyme removes only 20% 5caC.

In order to establish the preferred
substrate of DME, we determined
the apparent KM (K1/2) using the DMEΔNΔIDR1 construct. Interestingly,
the preference of DME for each substrate varied greatly (Figure D). The K1/2 for 5hmC
was comparable to 5mC, whereas K1/2 values
for 5caC and T/G were at least 25-fold smaller, indicating a preference
for binding these substrates (Table ). However,
the kst for 5hmC, 5caC, and T/G were all
lower than 5mC, suggesting inhibition by an intermediate or product
of these reactions (Figure D). Because DNA
glycosylases are often product inhibited and abasic sites opposite
5mC inhibit DME activity, we tested the
inhibitory effects of DNA containing a THF abasic site mimetic or
a 1-nucleotide gap, which resemble the reaction intermediate and product,
respectively, on 5mC and T/G excision activity by DME (). The abasic and gapped DNA products
inhibited 5mC excision with Ki values
of 11.3 ± 4.3 μM and 12.6 ± 3.3 μM, respectively,
which were roughly equivalent to the enzyme concentration used (10
μM) and to the strength of competition by 5mC-DNA (Ki = 4.3 ± 2.1 μM) and T/G-DNA (Ki = 7.7 ± 3.3 μM) substrates (). Similarly, the DNAs inhibited T/G excision
with Ki values of 2.4 ± 0.6 μM
(THF-DNA) and 6.8 ± 0.8 μM (Gap-DNA) (), similar to the enzyme concentration used (2 μM).
Therefore, the DNA products inhibited DME excision of 5mC and T/G
to the same extent. Consistent with this, Kd values measured by fluorescence anisotropy for binding of the catalytically
dead D1304N mutant to DNA containing 5mC and T/G were 0.6 ± 0.1
μM and 0.2 ± 0.1 μM, respectively (). In contrast to DNA intermediates and products,
we were unable to inhibit 5mC excision by free nucleobases, even at
high concentrations ().

Active Site Residues Confer Specificity for Substrate DNA
Substrate specificity of the HhH superfamily of DNA glycosylases
is largely determined by the shape and chemical complementarity between
the nucleobase within the active site pocket. The active site of DME predicted by the homology model is formed
by residues contributed by both A and glycosylase domains (Figure A), similar to that previously shown for ROS1. Superimposing an extrahelical 5mC onto our homology
model and an examination of other glycosylase–DNA structures,
including MBD4 in complex with T/G-DNA (PDB ID 4EVV), led to the identification
of six residues lining the DME nucleobase binding pocket: Phe759,
Thr776, and Asp781 from Domain A; and His1360, Tyr1361, and Ile1364
from the glycosylase domain (Figure A). Phe759
is predicted to reside on an unstructured loop and to stack against
the N4 nitrogen of 5mC. Thr776 and Asp781 sit adjacent to the abasic
site DNA in the DME homology model and correspond to two MBD4 residues
that were observed to make contacts to the flipped thymine substrate
in the crystal structures of MBD4 bound to DNA.− His1360, Tyr1361,
and Ile1364 reside near the predicted location of 5mC in the active
site.

DME active site mutants affect base excision. (A) Homology model

as in Figure . THF-containing DNA (gold) is
modeled from the structure of Nth bound to THF-DNA (PDB ID 1P59), and a modeled
5mC is shown in silver. (B) Single-turnover excision rates of 5mC

(C) Single-turnover rates of 5mC, 5hmC, 5caC, or T/G excision by each

We examined the contribution of each predicted active site
residue
to DME’s substrate specificity by mutational analysis of 5mC,
5hmC, 5caC, and T/G excision activity using the DMEΔNΔIDR1
construct (Figure B,C). All mutants purified
well and retained the brilliant yellow color of wild-type DME, indicating
proper folding of the proteins. Thr776Ala had only a modest reduction
in 5mC excision activity relative to wild-type. In contrast, leucine
substitution of the corresponding residue in ROS1 (Thr606) abolished
ROS1 activity. DME activity also differed
from ROS1 with respect to Tyr1361 (Tyr1028 in ROS1). DME Tyr1361Phe
reduced 5mC and T/G excision activity nearly 2-fold, whereas ROS1
Tyr1028Ser reduced 5mC activity 2-fold but increased preference for
T/G excision. In contrast to Thr776Ala
and Tyr1361Phe, which had only a modest effect on 5mC excision by
DME, Phe759Ala significantly reduced 5mC excision, and Asp781Ala,
His1360Ala, and Ile1364Ala abrogated 5mC excision (Figure B,C). A similar reduction in 5mC activity was observed
for ROS1 Asp611Val, which corresponds to DME Asp781. Similarly, DME Phe759Ala showed a higher activity for T/G
excision than 5mC excision, consistent with the corresponding residue
in ROS1 (Phe589Ala). His1360Ala was the
only mutation in DME that abrogated excision of all substrates (Figures C and ). Although Ile1364Ala
had no activity for 5mC or 5hmC, it retained activity for 5caC and
T/G at rates similar to wild-type (Figure C and ). Surprisingly, three mutations
(Phe759Ala, Asp781Ala, and Tyr1361Phe) showed a modest increase in 5caC excision rates relative to wild-type, but remained unable
to excise more than 20% of the 5caC-DNA substrate (Figures C and ). Interestingly,
the Asp781Ala substitution showed the highest increase in 5caC activity
despite complete loss of activity toward the other nucleobases tested.
Taken together, these results validate the homology model, identify
His1360, Asp781, and Ile1364 as important for DME activity, and suggest
that the various 5mC derivatives may be recognized through architectural
changes to the active site pocket.

Discussion
This
work represents the first quantitative structure–function
study of DME and DML3, providing a molecular rationale for their similarities
and differences to ROS1, which has been extensively characterized.− We previously identified the catalytic core of DME to be composed
of domains A and B in addition to the glycosylase domain and found
that IDR1 is dispensable for 5mC excision. Here, using the structure of the Nth-DNA complex as a guide, homology
modeling of DME revealed that domain A contributes three α-helices
to the glycosylase domain as previously identified in ROS1. The model also predicts that the IDR1 insertion
connects to the glycosylase domain on the side opposite the DNA binding
site, consistent with the fact that deletion of IDR1 had only a modest
effect on DME glycosylase activity in vitro. Moreover,
the rate of 5mC excision by DME was comparable to DML3 (Table ) and ROS1, which contain
variable IDR1s in both length and sequence, further implying that
the IDRs are not critical for 5mC excision activity. This large insertion
to a glycosylase fold is unique to the DME family, leading us to speculate
that these large insertions function to regulate in vivo activity, possibly by mediating protein interactions. For example,
specific IDR1–protein interactions may facilitate DME’s
activation of imprinted genes at specific loci and ROS1 and DML3’s
genome-wide demethylase activity.−

Our homology model and
mutagenesis results indicate that Asn778
and Met1238 are plug and wedge residues, respectively, important for
5mC detection. These two residues were identified to be critical for
DME activity from previous random mutagenesis experiments, which were
performed in vivo in the context of full-length DME. Interestingly, despite the similarity in their
predicted structures, DME, ROS1, and DML3 seem to utilize different
duplex interrogating residues. All DME family members contain an Asn-Gln
moiety predicted to reside on the loop containing the plug residue
in other glycosylases (). Whereas
alanine substitution of the Gln had a 10-fold greater effect than
that of the Asn residue on ROS1 activity, we found the opposite to
be true for DME. Moreover, alanine substitution of either Asn or Gln
abolished DML3 activity. These data suggest that the DNA intercalation
loop in each DME paralog engages the DNA differently. Because the
residues from this loop have been shown to be important for interrogation
of DNA during discrimination of modified versus unmodified nucleobases
prior to base flipping, a different mode
of intercalation would likely alter the mechanism by which each enzyme
locates its 5mC target. Moreover, this interrogating loop in HhH glycosylases
plays a role in recognition of the base opposite the lesion. For example,
Nth contacts the opposite base through hydrogen bonds from the backbone
carbonyl of Gln42, which aligns with
DME Asn778. There are no other candidate interactions with the opposing
G in our homology model, and thus we do not expect there to be a strong
opposite base specificity in DME. Consistent with this, ROS1 excises
5mC more efficiently when mispaired with C, T, or A, which is likely
due to the reduced thermodynamic stability of the base pair.

Despite differences in the identity of
the plug residue, both DME
and ROS1 utilize a conserved Met residue from the glycosylase domain
to wedge between the nucleobases opposite 5mC. Furthermore, we observed both similarities and differences
between the predicted active sites of DME and ROS1. Most notably,
the residue corresponding to DME Thr776 is essential to 5mC excision
in ROS1, but not in DME. Likewise, DME
Tyr1361Phe did not cause a change in substrate specificity between
5mC and T/G, although the corresponding mutation in ROS1 did. Therefore, despite the similarity among the
DME family of enzymes, we find subtle differences in substrate recognition
by both DNA intercalation and active site residues that may help explain
the differences in sites of demethylation in the Arabidopsis genome.−

We found the order of substrate preference for DME and DML3
to
be 5mC &gt; 5hmC ∼ T/G &gt; 5caC &gt; 5fC. However, when comparing
the
rates of excision, it appeared that DME bound both 5caC and T/G tighter
than 5mC and even excised 5caC faster than 5mC at low levels of enzyme.
DME was not inhibited by free 5mC or thymine base, and thus the low
maximal rate of T/G excision compared to 5mC cannot be explained by
product thymine remaining in the active site. In contrast, we found
that both 5mC and T/G excision were inhibited in the presence of product-DNA.
However, less product-DNA was needed to reduce T/G excision, indicating
a higher affinity of DME for 5mC-DNA as compared with T/G-DNA. Therefore,
we conclude that the apparent high affinity of DME for T/G- and 5caC-DNA
can be attributed to product DNA inhibition and to the slow turnover
of the enzyme for these substrates, as evidenced by their low kst values. Release of the abasic DNA product
is often the rate-limiting step in glycosylase reactions and is promoted
by AP-endonuclease, the next enzyme in BER pathway.− Consistent with this interpretation,
ROS1 excises 5mC and binds to the resulting abasic site in a distributive
manner.

DNA glycosylases, including
those belonging to the helix-hairpin-helix
superfamily, are either specific for oxidation or alkylation damage,
but not both. The ability of the DME
family of enzymes to remove both methylated 5mC and oxidized 5hmC
makes them unusual. This unique specificity is important in light
of the recent progress to understand active demethylation by TDG in
mammals. While DME excises 5hmC relatively
well compared to 5mC, it does not effectively remove 5fC or 5caC.
In contrast, TDG shows no activity for 5hmC, and has 40% greater activity
for 5fC and 25% residual activity for 5caC relative to its preferred
T/G substrate. Thus, DME and TDG have reciprocal specificities with
respect to the oxidized derivatives that may reflect the fact that
the 5mC oxidation pathway is not needed in plants. Although there
is no evidence to suggest that oxidized 5mC nucleobases are biologically
relevant substrates in Arabidopsis, the ability of DME to remove these bases provides
insight into 5mC discrimination inside the binding pocket. Residues
contributed by both domain A (Phe759 and Asp781) and the glycosylase
domain (His1360 and Ile1364) are necessary for full 5mC excision activity.
These data are consistent with our previous random mutagenesis screen,
in which mutations of Asp781 and His1360 abolished DME activity. Similarly, the lack of an effect of Thr776Ala
or Tyr1361Phe on 5mC excision correlates with the absence of Thr776
or Tyr1361 substitutions from the random screen. Interestingly, Ile1364
abolished 5mC and 5hmC excision, but did not affect activity toward
T/G, implicating this residue as an important recognition element
of cytosine derivatives. Phe579, located in close proximity to the
5mC methyl substituent, was the only residue to show a difference,
albeit modest, between 5mC and 5hmC activity. In contrast, the relatively
large distance of His1360 from the flipped base suggests that substitution
of this residue affected the folding of the binding pocket. Although
these data start to paint a picture of the 5mC active site, it is
conceivable that domain B, lying outside of the nucleobase binding
pocket, contributes to 5mC recognition, similar to the 8-oxoguanine
recognition domain of MutY. Indeed, domain
B contains residues essential to DME activity. Further structural analysis will be necessary to elucidate
the roles of domains A and B in DME.
