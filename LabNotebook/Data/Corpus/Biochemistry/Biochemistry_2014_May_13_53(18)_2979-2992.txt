FtsZ is an
essential protein
of the bacterial cell division machinery. During cell division, it
assembles into a contractile ring called the “Z-ring”
at the midcell position., Recent studies have
recognized FtsZ as a promising antimicrobial drug target.− Several inhibitors of FtsZ that inhibit the proliferation of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria by affecting FtsZ assembly dynamics have
been identified.− Because FtsZ is strongly homologous to tubulin in structure but
weakly similar to tubulin in sequence, small molecule inhibitors of
FtsZ may also show activities against mammalian cells. However, inhibitors
targeting FtsZ assembly in bacteria and not possessing much cytotoxicity
toward mammalian cells as compared to bacterial cells should be qualified
as suitable FtsZ-targeted agents., In this regard,
noncytotoxic taxanes can serve as potential molecules for the development
of FtsZ inhibitors. Different members
of taxanes show different cytotoxic effects toward the proliferation
of mammalian cells. For example, paclitaxel (Figure A), bearing an N-benzoylphenylisoserine moiety
at C13, shows a very high level of cytotoxicity in mammalian cells,
whereas taxane reversal agents (TRAs), bearing a hydrophobic 3-arylacrylic
acid moiety at C13 or C7, are found to be noncytotoxic. A library of 120 taxanes was designed, and their
antibacterial properties against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cells were assessed., The
SB-RA series of TRAs having an (E)-3-(naphtha-2-yl)acryloyl
(2-NpCH=CHCO) group at C13 demonstrated a MIC99 between
2.5 and 5 μM against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Mtb strains., On the basis of the MIC99 values and cytotoxicity assay, SB-RA-2001 (Figure A) was selected as a potential compound for antitubercular
drug discovery. Further, the cytotoxic effect of SB-RA-2001 in human
cancer cell lines was found to be significantly reduced (by 3 orders
of magnitude) compared to that of paclitaxel. Therefore, SB-RA-2001 could be used as a promising compound for
the development of noncytotoxic taxane-based FtsZ-targeted antibacterial
agents.

SB-RA-2001 exhibited characteristics on
tubulin assembly and tubulin
binding different from those of paclitaxel. (A) Structures of SB-RA-2001

This study evaluates the effects of SB-RA-2001 on FtsZ assembly
and elucidates its antibacterial mechanism. SB-RA-2001 treatment induced
cell elongation and inhibited bacterial cell proliferation without
having any detectable effects on either DNA replication or nucleoid
segregation. The results indicate that SB-RA-2001 perturbed Z-ring
formation in bacteria by promoting the assembly and stability of FtsZ
protofilaments. The study suggests that taxane derivatives have the
potential to be developed as FtsZ-targeted antibacterial agents.

PIPES, GTP, PMSF, DAPI, lysozyme, Cy3-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and propidium iodide were procured
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). IPTG was obtained from Calbiochem.
Bio-Gel P4 and P6 resin was procured from Bio-Rad. Nickel-NTA was
obtained from Qiagen. The rabbit polyclonal FtsZ antibody was obtained

method at the Ojima laboratory. The BacLight bacterial membrane potential kit was procured from
Invitrogen. The Factor Xa cleavage capture kit was obtained from Novagen,
EMD chemicals (San Diego, CA).

Preparation of the SB-RA-2001
Stock Solution
SB-RA-2001
was soluble in DMSO. A stock solution of 50 mM was prepared in 100%
DMSO and subsequently diluted in aqueous buffer. No precipitate of
SB-RA-2001 was visible up to 200 μM in PIPES buffer (pH 6.8).

Purification of Bacillus subtilis FtsZ
B. subtilis FtsZ was purified from Escherichia
coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells transformed with the pET16b vector. Briefly, cells were grown in LB medium containing
12.5 μg/mL chloramphenicol and 100 μg/mL ampicillin and
induced at the late log phase (OD600 = 0.8; 1 mM IPTG)
for 6 h. The induced cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold lysis
buffer [50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl]
containing 0.1% β-ME, 2 mM PMSF, and 1 mg/mL lysozyme. The protein
was purified using nickel-NTA agarose using elution buffer containing
25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole. Purified
protein was then desalted using the Biogel P6 resin pre-equilibrated
with 25 mM PIPES and 50 mM KCl (pH 6.8). The concentration of purified
FtsZ was determined by the Bradford method using BSA as a standard. The concentration of the protein was finally
adjusted using a correction factor of 1.2 for the FtsZ/BSA ratio. FtsZ aliquots were stored at −80 °C.
Prior to each experiment, FtsZ was centrifuged to remove aggregates.

Light Scattering Assay
Goat brain tubulin (10 μM)
in 25 mM PIPES buffer (pH 6.8) and 5 mM MgCl2 was incubated
without and with paclitaxel (3 μM) and SB-RA-2001 (10 and 20
μM) at 4 °C for 10 min. The polymerization was initiated
by adding 1 mM GTP to the reaction mixture, and the assembly of tubulin
was monitored at 400 nm using a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-6500,
JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a temperature-controlled bath at
37 °C.

The effect of SB-RA-2001 on the assembly kinetics
of FtsZ in vitro was determined by 90° light
scattering at 500 nm., Briefly, FtsZ (3 μM) was
incubated without or with different concentrations (20, 40, and 60
μM) of SB-RA-2001 in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) containing 50 mM KCl
and 5 mM MgCl2 at 4 °C for 10 min. Then, 1 mM GTP
was added to the reaction mixtures, and the kinetics of the assembly
of FtsZ was monitored at 37 °C for 600 s. The light scattering
traces of different concentrations of SB-RA-2001 in the absence of
FtsZ were also recorded (Figure S1 of the ). At higher concentrations, SB-RA-2001 showed some
light scattering; however, the light scattering intensity was much
higher in the presence of FtsZ than in its absence. The light scattering
traces of SB-RA-2001 alone were subtracted from their respective data
set with the protein. After assembly for 10 min, the reaction kinetics
reached an apparent equilibrium, and the scattering intensity after
assembly for 10 min was used to calculate the extent of assembly.
Additionally, the initial rate of the increase in the light scattering
intensity of the assembly of FtsZ in the absence and presence of SB-RA-2001
was determined from a linear plot of the light scattering intensity
of FtsZ assembly for the first 100 s.

Dilution-Induced Disassembly
Assay
FtsZ (5 μM)
in 25 mM PIPES buffer (pH 6.8) containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM GTP was polymerized at 37 °C for 5 min. The
preformed polymers were diluted five times in warm buffer [25 mM PIPES
buffer (pH 6.8) containing 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1
mM GTP] in the absence and presence of different concentrations (20,
40, and 60 μM) of SB-RA-2001 and incubated at 37 °C for
10 min. The polymers were collected through centrifugation (88760g) for 30 min at 30 °C, and the pellets were dissolved
in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
loading dye [0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.5 M DTT, 50% glycerol, and
10% SDS in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)]. Samples were resolved via 12%
SDS–PAGE, and the intensity of the bands was analyzed with
ImageJ Pro Plus.

Sedimentation Assay
FtsZ (3 μM)
was incubated
without or with different concentrations (20, 40, and 60 μM)
of SB-RA-2001 in 25 mM PIPES buffer (pH 6.8) containing 50 mM KCl
and 5 mM MgCl2 at 4 °C for 10 min. Polymerization
was conducted in the presence of 1 mM GTP at 37 °C for 10 min.
The polymers were collected by high-speed centrifugation (88760g) for 30 min at 30 °C. The pellets were dissolved
in SDS–PAGE loading dye [0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.5 M DTT,
50% glycerol, and 10% SDS in 0.25 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)]. Samples were
resolved via 12% SDS–PAGE, and band intensity was analyzed
with ImageJ Pro Plus.

Characterization of Binding of SB-RA-2001
to FtsZ and Tubulin
Direct binding of SB-RA-2001 to FtsZ
and tubulin was assessed using
the increase in the fluorescence intensity of SB-RA-2001 upon binding
to the proteins. SB-RA-2001 (2 μM) in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) was
incubated with either 5 μM FtsZ or 5 μM tubulin at 25
°C for 10 min. The fluorescence spectra were recorded in the
range of 340–520 nm using 320 nm as an excitation wavelength
using a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-6500, JASCO). The fluorescence
spectra of the corresponding blanks were recorded and subtracted from
the respective data sets. FtsZ and tubulin did not show significant
fluorescence in the wavelength range of 340–520 nm. Further,
to determine the effect of different concentrations of FtsZ on the
fluorescence intensity of SB-RA-2001, SB-RA-2001 (1 μM) was
incubated without and with (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 μM) FtsZ in 25
mM PIPES (pH 6.8) at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction mixtures
were excited at 320 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded in
the range of 340–520 nm in a fluorescence spectrometer (FP-6500,
JASCO).

The change in SB-RA-2001 fluorescence upon binding to
FtsZ was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) of the SB-RA-2001–FtsZ interaction. FtsZ (2
μM) in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) was incubated in the absence and
presence of different concentrations of SB-RA-2001 (2–60 μM)
for 15 min at 25 °C. After incubation for 15 min, fluorescence
spectra were recorded in the range of 340–520 nm using 320
nm as an excitation wavelength. All fluorescence spectra were recorded
using a cuvette with a path length of 0.3 cm. The spectra of equimolar
amounts of SB-RA-2001 were recorded in the absence of FtsZ. The change
in the fluorescence of SB-RA-2001 (ΔF) was
calculated by subtracting the fluorescence of free SB-RA-2001 from
that of SB-RA-2001 in the presence of FtsZ. The change in fluorescence
(ΔF) at 400 nm was fit to the equation ΔF = (ΔFmaxL)/(Kd + L), where ΔF is the change in the fluorescence intensity of SB-RA-2001
when it is in equilibrium with FtsZ, ΔFmax is the maximal change in the fluorescence of SB-RA-2001
when the receptor site is fully occupied, and L is
the concentration of SB-RA-2001. The dissociation constant of the
interaction of FtsZ and SB-RA-2001 was determined using GraphPad Prism
5 (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Because SB-RA-2001 has an absorbance
at 320 nm, the spectra were further corrected for the inner filter
effect using the equationwhere Fcorrected is the corrected fluorescence spectra of SB-RA-2001 after inner
filter correction, Fobserved is the observed
fluorescence of SB-RA-2001, and λex and λem are the absorbance of SB-RA-2001 at its excitation and emission
wavelengths, respectively.

Effect of GTP on the Binding of SB-RA-2001
to FtsZ
FtsZ (2 μM) was incubated in 25 mM PIPES (pH
6.8) containing
1 mM MgCl2 and 200 mM NaCl without or with different concentrations
of GTP (25–200 μM) on ice for 10 min. SB-RA-2001 (20
μM) was then added to each of the reaction mixtures, and they
were again incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The change in
the SB-RA-2001 fluorescence spectra was recorded in the range of 340–520
nm, keeping the excitation wavelength at 320 nm. Emission spectra
of the corresponding blanks for each of the reaction sets were also
recorded. The experiment was performed three times.

Electron Microscopy
Analysis
FtsZ (3 μM) was
incubated in PIPES buffer [25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 50 mM KCl, and 5
mM MgCl2] without and with different concentrations (20
and 60 μM) of SB-RA-2001 at 4 °C for 10 min. Then, 1 mM
GTP was added to each of the reaction mixtures, and polymerization
was conducted at 37 °C for 10 min. The protein polymers were
applied to Formvar carbon-coated copper grids (300 mesh) for 30 s
and blotted dry. The sample-containing grids were then negatively
stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s, dried, and observed under
a JEM 2100 ultra HRTEM instrument at 200 kV.

FITC Labeling of FtsZ
FtsZ contains several lysine
residues, and one or more of these lysine
residues can be covalently modified with FITC. Briefly, FtsZ (20 μM) was incubated with FITC (80
μM) in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8) for 4 h on ice. Then, the reaction
was quenched with 5 mM Tris-HCl. The unbound FITC was removed in two
steps: by being passed through a size exclusion column (P4 resin)
and then by dialysis against 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8). The concentration
of FITC-bound FtsZ was estimated by monitoring the absorbance of FITC
at 495 nm (molar extinction coefficient of 77000 M–1 cm–1). The incorporation ratio of FITC per FtsZ
molecule was calculated by dividing the concentration of FtsZ-bound
FITC by that of total FtsZ.

Fluorescence
Microscopy
FITC-FtsZ (3 μM) was
incubated without and with varying concentrations (20, 40, and 60
μM) of SB-RA-2001 in 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.8), 50 mM KCl, and 5
mM MgCl2 on ice for 10 min. Polymerization was initiated
by adding 1 mM GTP to the reaction mixtures and incubating them at
37 °C for 10 min. The polymeric suspensions (10 μL) were
then mounted on glass slides and observed using a fluorescence microscope
(Eclipse TE2000-U microscope, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

GTPase Assay
The C-terminal histidine tag of FtsZ was
removed using Factor Xa cleavage capture kit as described recently. The GTP hydrolysis rate of histidine-tagged BsFtsZ and untagged FtsZ was determined by the standard
malachite green/ammonium molybdate assay., Both histidine-tagged FtsZ and untagged FtsZ (6 μM) were polymerized
at 37 °C in 25 mM PIPES buffer (pH 6.8) containing 50 mM KCl,
5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM GTP, and the moles of inorganic phosphate
released at various time intervals (1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min) were
determined as described previously. The
GTPase activities of His-tagged FtsZ (1.5 ± 0.6 min–1) and untagged FtsZ (1.7 ± 0.5 min–1) were
found to be similar, indicating that the histidine tag does not influence
the GTPase activity of FtsZ.

The effects of SB-RA-2001 on the
GTPase activity of FtsZ were determined by the malachite green/ammonium
molybdate assay., Briefly, FtsZ (3 μM) was
incubated without and with different concentrations (20, 40, and 60
μM) of SB-RA-2001, and the moles of inorganic phosphate released
after assembly for 5 min were determined as described above.

Some of the FtsZ-targeted agents have been reported to form colloidal
aggregates under assembly conditions. Triton X-100 is used to solubilize the aggregates of the compounds
in enzymatic assays. Therefore, the effect
of SB-RA-2001 on the GTPase activity of FtsZ was also determined in
the presence of 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100. Initially, SB-RA-2001 (20, 40, and 60 μM) in 25 mM PIPES (pH
6.8), 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2 was incubated with 0.01%
Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 30 min. Following the incubation, the
reaction sets were subjected to centrifugation at 14000g for 20 min, and the supernatants were collected. Subsequently, FtsZ
(3 μM) was added to the supernatant having different concentrations
of SB-RA-2001 and incubated for 15 min. The polymerization reaction
was then initiated by the addition of 1 mM GTP to the reaction sets,
and polymerization continued for 5 min at 37 °C. The moles of
inorganic phosphate released were determined as described previously.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
FtsZ (5 μM)
was incubated in the absence and presence of 10 and 20 μM SB-RA-2001
in 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) for 10 min at 25 °C. The far-UV
CD spectrum was recorded (200–250 nm) using a 0.1 cm path length
quartz cuvette in a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. The CD spectra
were deconvoluted using CDNN, SSE software from JASCO. Each spectrum
was an average of five scans, and the experiment was repeated three
times.

Docking Methodology
The molecular docking tool AutoDock4.2 was used to identify the putative binding site
of SB-RA-2001 on the B. subtilis FtsZ monomer. The
three-dimensional coordinates of SB-RA-2001 were prepared using the
PRODRG server. The X-ray structures of BsFtsZ [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 2RHL, A chain] and SaFtsZ (PDB entry 4DXD) were used as models for docking analysis. In SaFtsZ, PC190723 was also present in addition to FtsZ and GDP. PC190723
was extracted prior to the docking simulation. The entire surface
of FtsZ was covered in a grid box with dimensions of 170 Å ×
170 Å × 170 Å with a grid spacing of 0.375 Å.
SB-RA-2001 and PC190723 were used as flexible molecules, and FtsZ
was considered as a rigid molecule for the docking analysis. The Lamarckian
genetic algorithm was used for docking with default parameters. The
docking of SB-RA-2001 and PC190723 to FtsZ was performed by conducting
50 independent jobs, each including 100 runs and yielding 5000 conformations.
The clustering of these conformations was performed at a root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) of 6 Å. The clusters having more than 100 conformations
were further selected on the basis of binding energy. Finally, the
best cluster with minimal energy was chosen for further analysis.
The interaction of SB-RA-2001 with FtsZ was analyzed using PyMol. In addition, the structure of BsFtsZ (PDB entry 2RHL), in which docked SB-RA-2001 is present (consisting of docked SB-RA-2001
and GDP), was superimposed on that of β-tubulin. The β-tubulin
with GDP and paclitaxel was extracted from tubulin of Bos
taurus (PDB entry 1JFF).

Effect of
SB-RA-2001 on Bacterial Cell Proliferation
B. subtilis 168 cells were grown overnight in LB
broth at 37 °C and then inoculated into fresh LB tubes at an
initial OD600 of 0.1. The cells were grown in the absence
and presence of different concentrations of SB-RA-2001 for 4 h at
37 °C. The inhibition of cell proliferation was monitored by
measuring OD600, and the percent inhibition of cell proliferation
was calculated using the formulawhere Nt and Nc are the absorbances of
SB-RA-2001-treated
and untreated B. subtilis 168 cells, respectively,
after 4 h and N0 is the OD600 at time zero. The concentration of SB-RA-2001, at which 50% inhibition
of B. subtilis 168 cells was observed, was determined
to be its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50).

Determination of the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
The MIC values of SB-RA-2001 for B. subtilis 168
and Mycobacterium smegmatis cell proliferation were
determined by the agar dilution method. Briefly, B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis were grown in liquid medium (LB and Middlebrook 7H9 broth, respectively)
for 16 h at 37 °C. The cell densities of the bacterial cultures
were calculated from OD600 (1 OD600 unit = 1
× 109 cells/mL), and cultures were serially diluted
to a final cell density of 1 × 106 cells/mL; 105 cells of B. subtilis 168 and M.
smegmatis were then plated onto LB and Middlebrook 7H9 agar
plates, respectively, containing various concentrations of SB-RA-2001.
The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h for B. subtilis 168 cells and 36 h for M. smegmatis cells. The
concentration of SB-RA-2001 at which no colonies were observed was
considered the MIC. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

Visualization of Morphological Changes in Bacteria
Morphological
changes in B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis cells incubated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO) and
20 μM SB-RA-2001 were observed. LB and Middlebrook 7H9 broth media were inoculated with microbial
cultures of B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis cells, respectively, grown overnight and incubated (4 and 16 h)
at 37 °C. The cells were fixed at 25 °C using 2.8% formaldehyde
and 0.04% glutaraldehyde, and then, the cells were pelleted, washed,
and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4). The cell morphology was observed
by a differential interference contrast microscope (Eclipse TE2000-U
microscope, Nikon) at a 60× magnification. The cell length was
measured using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD).

Effect of SB-RA-2001 on Z-Ring Formation and Nucleoid Segregation
Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed to visualize the effect
of SB-RA-2001 on Z-ring formation and nucleoid segregation. For visualization of the Z-ring, LB tubes were
inoculated with B. subtilis 168 cells (OD600 = 0.1) and further incubated for 4 h in the presence of vehicle
(0.1% DMSO) and 20 and 30 μM SB-RA-2001. The cells were then
fixed using 2.8% formaldehyde and 0.04% glutaraldehyde for 30 min
at room temperature. Staining of cytoplasmic FtsZ was performed with
a polyclonal FtsZ antibody (1:50) developed in rabbit, followed by
staining with a Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(1:200). Nucleoids were stained using DAPI (20 μg/mL) and superimposed
with Cy3 secondary antibody-stained FtsZ to obtain the merged image.
The quantitation of Z-ring formation and nucleoid segregation was
achieved by scoring 200 bacterial cells under each experimental condition.

GFP-tagged Spo0J in B. subtilis 168 strain HM160
cells (a gift from L. Hamoen, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon
Tyne, U.K.) was grown (Casein Hydrolysate Broth containing 2 mg/L
kanamycin) at 37 °C in the presence of 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) and
20 μM SB-RA-2001 for 4 h. B. subtilis Spo0J
cells were harvested and fixed similarly as mentioned above. Nucleoid
staining was achieved with 20 μg/mL DAPI. Images were captured
using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, IX 81 with FV-500)
at a 60× magnification. Merged images of individual cells were
obtained by superimposing GFP-tagged Spo0J and DAPI-stained nucleoids.

FACS Analysis
Fresh LB tubes were inoculated with a
culture of B. subtilis 168 cells grown overnight
in the absence and presence of 20 μM SB-RA-2001 at 37 °C
for 4 h. The cells were collected and fixed using a fixing solution
(2.8% formaldehyde and 0.04% glutaraldehyde). Untreated and treated
cells were permeabilized by subsequent treatments with PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS in the presence of lysozyme and EDTA, respectively.
The permeabilized cells were then incubated with 50 μg/mL propidium
iodide for 1 h at 25 °C in dark. Flow cytometry was performed
using FACS Aria (Beckton Dickinson). Analysis of the data was performed
using FCS express 4 (research edition, trial version). The median
fluorescence intensity of propidium iodide (PI) was used to analyze
the change in the DNA content of the SB-RA-2001-treated cells with
respect to the DNA content of the control cells. The experiment was
repeated twice.

Effect of SB-RA-2001 on Late Cell Division
Protein DivIVA
GFP-tagged DivIVA in B. subtilis 168 strain 1803
cells (a gift from L. Hamoen) was grown (Casein Hydrolysate Broth)
to an OD600 of 0.1 at 37 °C in the presence of 12.5
mg/L chloramphenicol. Subsequently, the cells were grown in the presence
of a vehicle (0.1% DMSO) or 20 μM SB-RA-2001 for 1 h. The cells
were then harvested, fixed, and stained for FtsZ. Images were captured
using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, IX 81 with FV-500)
at a 60× magnification. The images of GFP-tagged DivIVA and Cy3
secondary antibody-stained FtsZ of individual cells were superimposed
on each other to obtain the merged image.

Effect of SB-RA-2001 on
the Membrane Potential of B.
subtilis 168 Cells
Inhibition of bacterial cell
proliferation can be caused by a perturbed membrane potential in cells. The effect of SB-RA-2001 on the membrane potential
of B. subtilis 168 cells was determined using a fluorescent
probe, 3,3′-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC2). DiOC2 exhibits green fluorescence in the monomeric
state, and an increase in membrane potential is known to induce self-association
of the dye that accompanies the red shift in the spectrum., Therefore, the membrane potential of B. subtilis 168 cells in the absence and presence of SB-RA-2001 was determined
using the change in DiOC2 fluorescence. Briefly, a culture of B. subtilis 168
cells grown overnight was inoculated into fresh LB tubes and grown
at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells (1 × 105) were resuspended
in filtered PBS and further incubated without or with a positive control
(0.2 μM), carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), or
SB-RA-2001 (20 and 30 μM) at 25 °C for 30 min. Then, 12
μM DiOC2 was added to each of the reaction sets,
and the mixtures were further incubated for 30 min in the dark. The
reaction mixtures were excited at 470 nm, and the fluorescence emission
spectra (500–550 nm) were monitored. Spectra of the respective
blanks were also recorded.

Mammalian Cell Proliferation Assay
Human cervical carcinoma
(HeLa) cells were cultured in MEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and a 1% antibacterial and antifungal solution. Cells were kept in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator
at 37 °C. To evaluate the effect of SB-RA-2001 on the proliferation
of HeLa cells, 1 × 105 cells per milliliter were grown
without or with different concentrations of SB-RA-2001 for 24 h in
a 96-well cell culture plate. After incubation, cells were fixed,
and the effect of different concentrations of SB-RA-2001 on mammalian
cell proliferation was measured by the sulforhodamine B assay., Data were averages of three independent experiments. Under similar
experimental conditions, effects of paclitaxel on HeLa cell proliferation
were also evaluated.

Results
SB-RA-2001 Did Not Promote
the Assembly of Tubulin and Bound
Very Weakly to Tubulin in Vitro
Paclitaxel
(Figure A) is known to promote the assembly
of tubulin and to stabilize microtubules. SB-RA-2001 (Figure A) had no detectable
effect on the assembly of purified tubulin (Figure B). SB-RA-2001 was found to exhibit an intrinsic fluorescence
at 400 nm. The increase in SB-RA-2001 fluorescence at 400 nm upon
binding to tubulin or FtsZ was used as a tool to assess the interaction
of SB-RA-2001 with tubulin and FtsZ (Figure C). The preliminary experiment indicated that SB-RA-2001 binds to
FtsZ more efficiently than to tubulin (Figure C). The cytotoxicity of SB-RA-2001 against proliferation of mammalian
cells was determined by growing HeLa cells in the absence and presence
of SB-RA-2001. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the proliferation of HeLa cells occurred in the presence of
45 ± 5 μM compound. The concentration of SB-RA-2001 required
to inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cells by 100% was determined
to be 135 ± 10 μM. The effect of paclitaxel on HeLa cell
proliferation was also examined, and the IC50 was determined
to be 12 ± 2 nM. The results together indicated that SB-RA-2001
interacted with tubulin and microtubules very weakly.

SB-RA-2001
Prevented the Disassembly of Preformed FtsZ Polymers
FtsZ
polymers are known to disassemble upon dilution. SB-RA-2001
suppressed dilution-induced disassembly of preformed FtsZ polymers
(Figure A). For example, the recovery of FtsZ
polymers was found to increase by 13 ± 5, 22 ± 7, and 46
± 4% compared to the control in the presence of 20, 40, and 60
μM SBRA-2001, respectively, indicating that SB-RA-2001 can stabilize
FtsZ polymers.

SB-RA-2001 promoted the assembly of FtsZ in vitro. (A) SB-RA-2001 reduced the level of dilution-induced disassembly
of preformed FtsZ polymers. Lanes 1–4 show the amounts of FtsZ
polymers recovered after dilution-induced disassembly in the absence
of SB-RA-2001 and in the presence of 20, 40, and 60 μM SB-RA-2001,
respectively. Lane 5 contained the protein molecular mass markers
(kilodaltons). The experiment was performed three times. (B) Assembly
of FtsZ in the absence (▲) and presence of 20 (□), 40
(○), and 60 μM (◆) SB-RA-2001 monitored by 90°
light scattering. The experiment was performed three times. (C) FtsZ
(3 μM) was polymerized without or with different concentrations
of SB-RA-2001. Lanes 1–4 show the amounts of FtsZ polymerized
in the absence of SB-RA-2001 and in the presence of 20, 40, and 60
μM SB-RA-2001, respectively. The experiment was conducted in
triplicate.

SB-RA-2001 Promoted the
Assembly and Bundling of FtsZ Protofilaments in Vitro
Because SB-RA-2001 stabilizes FtsZ polymers,
we checked whether it could promote FtsZ assembly (Figure B). The light scattering traces of FtsZ assembly
kinetics in the absence and presence of different concentrations of
SB-RA-2001 indicated that SB-RA-2001 enhanced the assembly of FtsZ
(Figure B and Figure S1 of the ). For example, the light
scattering intensity of FtsZ (3 μM) was increased by 51 ±
23% in the presence of 40 μM SB-RA-2001 compared to the control.
Further, SB-RA-2001 appeared to increase the initial rate of FtsZ
assembly. For example, the initial rate of increase in the light scattering
intensity of FtsZ assembly for the first 100 s was determined to be
0.07, 0.19, and 0.38 au/s in the absence of SB-RA-2001 and in the
presence of 20 and 40 μM SB-RA-2001, respectively. The sedimentable
polymer mass of FtsZ also increased in the presence of SB-RA-2001
compared to the control, indicating that SB-RA-2001 enhances the assembly
of FtsZ in vitro (Figure C). The amount of polymerized FtsZ was found to increase by 20 ±
10, 23 ± 15, and 30 ± 10% in the presence of 20, 40, and
60 μM SB-RA-2001, respectively. Additionally, electron microscopy
analysis of FtsZ assembly revealed that the assembly of FtsZ was enhanced
in the presence of SB-RA-2001 (Figure S2A of the ). The extent of bundling as well as
the number of polymers of FtsZ per field of view was found to increase
significantly in the presence of 20 and 60 μM SB-RA-2001 compared
to those of the control. This observation was also supported well
by fluorescence microscopy studies in which SB-RA-2001 was found to
increase the level of assembly of FITC-FtsZ in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure S2B of the ).

SB-RA-2001 Suppressed the GTPase Activity of FtsZ in
Vitro
Because the assembly dynamics of FtsZ is regulated
by its GTPase activity, the effect of
SB-RA-2001 on the GTP hydrolysis rate of FtsZ assembly was examined
(Figure ). SB-RA-2001 was found to suppress
the GTPase activity of FtsZ in a concentration-dependent fashion.
Further, to confirm that the inhibition of the GTPase activity of
FtsZ observed in the presence of SB-RA-2001 was not due to the self-aggregation
of the compound, the GTPase assay was also performed in the presence
of 0.01% Triton X-100. The inhibition
of the GTPase activity of FtsZ by SB-RA-2001 was found to be similar
in the absence and presence of 0.01% Triton X-100 (Figure ). For example, 20, 40, and 60 μM SB-RA-2001
inhibited the GTPase activity of FtsZ by 25 ± 7.8, 51 ±
9.4, and 65 ± 13%, respectively, in the absence of 0.01% Triton
X-100, while these concentrations of SB-RA-2001 inhibited the GTPase
activity of FtsZ by 36 ± 1.4, 53 ± 7, and 64.6 ± 4%,
respectively, in the presence of 0.01% Triton X-100.

SB-RA-2001 suppressed
the GTPase activity of FtsZ. The effects
of SB-RA-2001 on the GTPase activity of FtsZ without (■) and
with 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 (○) were determined after assembly
for 5 min. The data are from three sets of experiments.

SB-RA-2001 Bound to FtsZ in Vitro
A fixed concentration of SB-RA-2001, upon incubation with
different
concentrations of FtsZ, showed a concentration-dependent increase
in the fluorescence intensity of SB-RA-2001 (Figure A). The fluorescence emission maximum of SB-RA-2001 was found
to be 440 and 400 nm in the absence and presence of 5 μM FtsZ,
respectively. SB-RA-2001 showed a large blue shift in its emission
maximum upon interacting with FtsZ, and the fluorescence intensity
was also enhanced, suggesting that SB-RA-2001 binds to FtsZ.

Binding interaction
of SB-RA-2001 and FtsZ monitored by fluorescence
spectroscopy. (A) FtsZ increased the fluorescence intensity of SB-RA-2001.
The fluorescence spectra of 1 μM SB-RA-2001 in the absence of
FtsZ (+) and in the presence of 1 (◀), 2 (◇), 3 (●),
4 (△), and 5 (■) μM FtsZ are shown. (B). FtsZ
(2 μM) was incubated with different concentrations of SB-RA-2001
for 15 min at 25 °C. The change in the fluorescence intensity
of the FtsZ–SB-RA-2001 complex is plotted vs SB-RA-2001 concentration.

A fixed concentration of FtsZ
was incubated with varying concentrations
of SB-RA-2001 to determine the dissociation constant of the interaction
of SB-RA-2001 with FtsZ. The dissociation constant of the interaction
of SB-RA-2001 with FtsZ was determined by monitoring the increase
in SB-RA-2001 fluorescence upon binding to FtsZ. The data were then
fit to a binding isotherm, and a dissociation constant of 29 ±
2 μM was estimated for the interaction of SB-RA-2001 with FtsZ,
suggesting that the ligand binds to FtsZ with a modest affinity (Figure B).

The effect of GTP on the binding of SB-RA-2001
to FtsZ was determined
by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of SB-RA-2001 upon binding
to FtsZ at 400 nm (Figure S3 of the ). The increase in the fluorescence intensity of
SB-RA-2001 in the presence of FtsZ was found to be similar without
or with different concentrations of GTP, indicating that SB-RA-2001
does not compete with GTP for its binding to FtsZ (Figure S3 of the ). We have also measured
the fluorescence of SB-RA-2001 in the presence of FtsZ at 460 nm.
The fluorescence of the FtsZ–SB-RA-2001 complex (at 460 nm)
did not change in the absence or presence of GTP, indicating that
GTP did not compete for binding at the same site on FtsZ. Further,
SB-RA-2001 did not have any effect on the secondary structure of FtsZ
as the far-UV CD spectrum of FtsZ was found to be unaltered in the
presence of varying concentrations of SB-RA-2001 (data not shown).

Putative Binding Site of SB-RA-2001 on FtsZ
Initially,
docking of PC190723 was performed on SaFtsZ as a
control (Figure S4 of the ). The PC190723 topology was extracted from SaFtsZ
(PDB entry 4DXD). The docked conformation of PC190723
was compared with the X-ray crystallographically determined structure
(Figure S4 of the  and Table ), and the root-mean-square deviation
(rmsd) between docked PC190723 and crystallized PC190723 was estimated
to be 0.951 Å, indicating appropriate docking., Further, docking of SB-RA-2001 and PC190723 on BsFtsZ (PDB entry 2RHL) was performed using a similar methodology.

The common residues of docked PC190723
and crystal PC190723 are shown in bold.

SB-RA-2001 was docked into the BsFtsZ structure
to determine the putative binding site and the residues of BsFtsZ involved in the interaction with SB-RA-2001 (Figure ). An analysis of the docking results indicated
that SB-RA-2001 bound to FtsZ in a cleft region between helix H7 and
the C-terminal domain. Further, the residues of BsFtsZ within 4 Å of the SB-RA-2001 moiety were identified (Table ), and the bold residues in Table  are the BsFtsZ residues common to both PC190723
and SB-RA-2001 identified through docking analysis. SB-RA-2001 was
forming hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions with BsFtsZ. The five residues of BsFtsZ (E305,
R191, Q192, N188, and N33) were observed to be hydrogen bonded to
SB-RA-2001 (Figure ). Because the mechanism
of action of SB-RA-2001 was similar to that of PC190723, we docked SB-RA-2001 on BsFtsZ
in combination with PC190723 (Figure ). Interestingly,
both SB-RA-2001 and PC190723 were found to bind to analogous binding
pockets in BsFtsZ and also to share some interacting
residues (Table ).

SB-RA-2001 Caused Growth Inhibition and Induced Filamentation
in B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis Cells
SB-RA-2001 inhibited the proliferation of B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis cells
in liquid culture with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 20 ± 1 and 18 ± 1 μM, respectively.
However, SB-RA-2001 did not inhibit the proliferation of E.
coli K12 cells in liquid culture. The effect of SB-RA-2001
on the growth of B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis cell proliferation was also measured by the standard colony counting
method. In control, the CFU was found
to be (2.4 ± 1.2) × 106, and the CFU was reduced
to (4.9 ± 0.7) × 105, (3.2 ± 0.4) ×
104, and (1.2 ± 0.3) × 104 in the
presence of 20, 25, and 35 μM SB-RA-2001, respectively (Figure
S5 of the ). However,
no colony was observed in the presence of 38 μM SB-RA-2001,
suggesting it to be the MIC value of SB-RA-2001 on B. subtilis 168 cells. Similarly, the CFU of M. smegmatis cells
was found to be (5.7 ± 0.5) × 107, (11.7 ±
0.4) × 106, and (3.7 ± 0.4) × 105 in the absence of SB-RA-2001 and in the presence of 50 and 55 μM
SB-RA-2001, respectively, and the MIC was estimated to be 60 μM.
Previously, SB-RA-2001 was reported to inhibit the proliferation of
clinical isolates of Mtb strains H37Rv (drug-sensitive)
and IMCJ946 K2 (multi-drug-resistant) with MICs of 5 and 1.25 μM,
respectively.

Further, SB-RA-2001
treatment induced strong filamentation in B. subtilis 168 (Figure ) and M. smegmatis cells. The average cell lengths of B. subtilis 168
and M. smegmatis cells were determined to be 3.4
± 1 and 2.8 ± 0.5 μm, respectively, in the absence
of the compound. Upon treatment with 20 μM SB-RA-2001, the average
cell lengths of B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis cells were found to be 42 ± 18 and 35 ± 25 μm, respectively.
The lengths of vehicle-treated B. subtilis 168 cells
were found to be in the range of 4–6 μm; however, SB-RA-2001-treated
cells were highly elongated with a majority of the cells being in
the range of 20–150 μm (Figure ). These results suggested that SB-RA-2001 inhibited microbial proliferation
by affecting the cytokinesis.

SB-RA-2001 induced filament formation in B. subtilis 168 cells. (A) B. subtilis 168
cells were grown

the length of control (vehicle-treated) and 20 μM SB-RA-2001-treated B. subtilis 168 cells.

SB-RA-2001 Targeted Z-Ring Formation in B. subtilis 168 Cells
To determine whether inhibition of septum formation
in B. subtilis 168 cells was due to the disruption
in Z-ring formation, we examined the effects of SB-RA-2001 on Z-ring
formation and nucleoid segregation (Figure ). In the absence of SB-RA-2001, 68% of the B. subtilis 168 cells had Z-rings. However, SB-RA-2001 treatment strongly inhibited
Z-ring formation in B. subtilis cells. For example,
20 and 17% of the cells had a Z-ring in the presence of 20 and 30
μM SB-RA-2001, respectively. Further, the number of Z-rings
per micrometer of cell length was determined to be 0.15 ± 0.03,
0.03 ± 0.01, and 0.02 ± 0.01 in the absence of SB-RA-2001
and in the presence of 20 and 30 μM SB-RA-2001, respectively.
The fluorescence of FtsZ (stained with the Cy3 secondary antibody)
in the cells treated with SB-RA-2001 was found to be diffused and
localized as spots and helices throughout the cell instead of a defined
ring at the midcell (Figure ).

SB-RA-2001 perturbed
Z-ring formation without affecting nucleoid
segregation in B. subtilis 168 cells. B.
subtilis 168 cells were incubated with vehicle (control)
and 20 and 30 μM SB-RA-2001 for 4 h. Scales bars are 1, 10,
and 20 μm, respectively.

Because the Z-ring acts as a scaffold for the recruitment
of several
cell division proteins, its perturbation is expected to affect their
positioning at the midcell. Therefore,
the effect of SB-RA-2001 on the cellular localization of DivIVA, a
protein that remains at both the poles and is recruited to the Z-ring
at the onset of septal constriction, was examined. In the untreated cells, GFP-tagged DivIVA showed the expected
pattern of localization, i.e., at the midcell and poles, whereas DivIVA
was mostly located at the two poles and was no longer recruited to
the prospective cell division site in the SB-RA-2001-treated cells
(Figure A). Moreover, the presence of punctate
spots of DivIVA and FtsZ through the cell length indicated the presence
of incomplete Z-ring formation in the presence of SB-RA-2001. The
perturbed localization of DivIVA supported the finding that Z-ring
formation was hampered in the presence of 20 μM SB-RA-2001.
Further, the merged images of GFP-tagged DivIVA and Cy3-stained FtsZ
also confirmed that FtsZ assembly at the midcell was affected.

delocalized GFP-DivIVA but did not influence the localization

(B) Effects of SB-RA-2001 on the localization of GFP-tagged Spo0J

Septum formation can
be inhibited either by direct interference
with the cell division machinery or by impaired nucleoid segregation. The quantification of DNA in SB-RA-2001-treated
cells was achieved using flow cytometric analysis. The median fluorescence
intensity of propidium iodide-stained SB-RA-2001-treated cells was
found to increase by several-fold compared to that of the vehicle-treated B. subtilis 168 cells, indicating that the average DNA content
of SB-RA-2001-treated cells was much higher than that of the control
cells (Figure S6 of the ). SB-RA-2001 induced elongation of B. subtilis 168
cells (Figure ), and these elongated cells
harbored several copies of nucleoids (Figures  and B). The marked difference in the DNA
content of the treated and control cells therefore indicated that
the DNA duplication was not perturbed in the presence of SB-RA-2001
(Figure S6 of the ). The effect of 20 μM SB-RA-2001 on nucleoid segregation was
examined by staining the exponentially grown B. subtilis 168 cells with DAPI (Figure S7 of the ). Most of the control cells had two nucleoids;
19, 75, and 6% of the control cells were found to have one, two, and
four nucleoids, respectively. In the presence of 20 μM SB-RA-2001,
single-nucleoid-containing cells were not found, 23% of the cells
had two nucleoids, and 77% of the cells had four or more nucleoids.
The frequency of the presence of nucleoids per micrometer of cell
length was found to be nearly identical in the absence and presence
of SB-RA-2001. For example, the number of nucleoids per micrometer
of the cell length was determined to be 0.49 ± 0.1 and 0.4 ±
0.05 in the absence and presence of 20 μM SB-RA-2001, respectively,
indicating that SB-RA-2001 had no appreciable effect on nucleoid segregation
(Figure S7 of the ). Further, the effect of SB-RA-2001 on the localization pattern
of Spo0J was examined in B. subtilis cells. Spo0J is a chromosomally associated protein,
required for proper chromosomal partitioning, separation of sister
origins, and synchronous DNA replication at the initiation of the
DNA replication process., Delocalization of Spo0J
from either side of the nucleoid would indicate imperfect nucleoid
segregation., The localization pattern of Spo0J
in SB-RA-2001-treated cells was found to be similar to that of the
control cells (Figure B). The results together
indicated that SB-RA-2001 might not have a discernible effect on nucleoid
segregation.

SB-RA-2001 Did Not Perturb the Membrane Potential
of B. subtilis 168 Cells
Vehicle-treated B.
subtilis 168 cells displayed weak DiOC2 fluorescence
(Figure ). As expected, a strong increase
in DiOC2 fluorescence was observed in the presence of CCCP
(a positive control), indicating that CCCP treatment perturbed the
membrane potential of B. subtilis 168 cells., However, 20 and 30 μM SB-RA-2001-treated B. subtilis 168 cells showed emission spectra similar to that of the vehicle-treated
cells, suggesting that SB-RA-2001 did not affect the membrane potential
of B. subtilis 168 cells (Figure ).

Discussion
In this study, a taxane, SB-RA-2001, was
found to effectively inhibit
the proliferation of B. subtilis 168 and M. smegmatis cells and to induce filamentation in these
cells. Further, SB-RA-2001 perturbed the formation of the Z-ring in B. subtilis 168 cells without disturbing nucleoid segregation.
Moreover, it affected the localization of the late cell division protein,
DivIVA, suggesting that it targeted FtsZ in vivo. In vitro, SB-RA-2001 bound to purified FtsZ, promoted its
assembly, and reduced the GTPase activity of FtsZ, suggesting that
SB-RA-2001 inhibited the proliferation of bacterial cells by perturbing
the assembly dynamics of FtsZ. A computational analysis indicated
that SB-RA-2001 binds to FtsZ in the interdomain cleft region between
the C-terminal domain and helix H7. However, SB-RA-2001 did not have
any effect on the assembly of tubulin in vitro. In
addition, a fluorescence spectroscopy experiment indicated that SB-RA-2001
binds to tubulin very weakly. The saturation was not achieved even
up to 400 μM SB-RA-2001. Because of the limited solubility and
inner filter effect at high SB-RA-2001 concentrations, it was not
possible to quantify the Kd of the interaction
of tubulin and SB-RA-2001. The results together suggested that SB-RA-2001
binds to tubulin very weakly compared to its binding to FtsZ.

Paclitaxel and SB-RA-2001 showed markedly different effects on
mammalian cell proliferation and on the assembly of tubulin in vitro. Under similar conditions, paclitaxel inhibited
HeLa cell proliferation with an IC50 of 12 ± 2 nM
while SB-RA-2001 inhibited HeLa cell proliferation with an IC50 of 45 ± 5 μM, indicating that the cytotoxicity
of SB-RA-2001 against mammalian cells was 3750-fold weaker than that
of paclitaxel. In addition, low concentrations of paclitaxel greatly
enhanced the assembly of tubulin; in contrast, SB-RA-2001 did not
enhance tubulin assembly (Figure ). Furthermore,
paclitaxel was reported to bind to microtubules strongly with an apparent
binding constant of 0.87 μM, while
SB-RA-2001 does not appear to bind to tubulin effectively. The results
together showed that compared to paclitaxel, SB-RA-2001 exerts only
weak effects on tubulin assembly and mammalian cell proliferation.

It should be noted that SB-RA-2001 is different from paclitaxel
because of the presence of the (E)-3-(naphtha-2-yl)acryloyl
(2-NpCH=CHCO) group in place of the N-benzoylisoserine
moiety at the C13 position of the paclitaxel molecule. The results
indicated that the substitution at C13 contributed to the substantially
different effects of SB-RA-2001 on FtsZ and tubulin. This structure–activity
relationship analysis was further supported by an analysis in which
the structures of tubulin and BsFtsZ were superimposed
on each other to obtain a clear view of a probable paclitaxel binding
site on FtsZ. In this respect, the crystal structures of tubulin (PDB
entry 1JFF)
and BsFtsZ (PDB entry 2RHL) were superimposed on each other and
structurally aligned using PyMol to determine the residues of BsFtsZ that were in the proximity of the paclitaxel binding
site in tubulin. The BsFtsZ residues close to the
paclitaxel-like site projected to be bound by docked PC190723 and
SB-RA-2001 have been highlighted (Table. ).
Interestingly, it was observed that there was no similarity between
the identified residues of tubulin and FtsZ (Table ), which were located within 4 Å of the paclitaxel binding
site in tubulin. The findings indicated
the probable resistance of tubulin toward SB-RA-2001 compared to that
of FtsZ.

SB-RA-2001 exhibited only weak fluorescence with the
emission maximum
at 440 nm. When FtsZ binds, the emission maximum was shifted to 400
nm (a blue shift of ∼40 nm), suggesting that the compound binds
to FtsZ at a hydrophobic pocket. The increase in the fluorescence
intensity of the SB-RA-2001–FtsZ complex as compared to that
of free SB-RA-2001 is likely due to the immobilization of SB-RA-2001
in the hydrophobic pocket of FtsZ. Further, the GTP competition assay
suggested that SB-RA-2001 binds at a location different from the GTP
binding site on FtsZ. We propose that binding of SB-RA-2001 to FtsZ
might favor the strengthened lateral interaction of FtsZ protofilaments,
leading to an increase in the extent of bundling of FtsZ filaments.
FtsZ forms dynamic polymers, and the dynamicity is regulated by the
GTPase activity of FtsZ. SB-RA-2001 enhanced
the stability of FtsZ polymers, and the stable polymers led to the
suppression of the GTP hydrolysis rate of FtsZ. Moreover, SB-RA-2001
inhibited the GTPase activity of FtsZ similarly in the absence and
presence of detergent Triton X-100, suggesting that the inhibitory
effect observed was not a consequence of the formation of colloids
by SB-RA-2001. A recent study has suggested that some of the FtsZ-targeted
compounds such as totarol, Zantrin Z1, and 4′-hydroxydichamanetin
might inhibit the GTPase activity of FtsZ through the mechanism of
self-aggregation of the compound.

The mechanism of action of SB-RA-2001 on FtsZ resembled that of
microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel. In vitro, paclitaxel promotes tubulin assembly; however, in cells, it triggers
cell death by stabilizing microtubules, which prevents the formation
and functioning of the mitotic spindle. In a similar manner, SB-RA-2001 also promoted the assembly and bundling
of FtsZ protofilaments in vitro but perturbed the
formation of Z-rings in cells. Similar effects were also shown by
other FtsZ-stabilizing agents such as OTBA and PC190723; these agents
promoted the bundling of FtsZ in vitro but prevented
Z-ring formation in cells.,In silico analysis of binding of SB-RA-2001 to FtsZ indicated that the taxane
derivative binds to BsFtsZ in the interdomain cleft
region, adjacent to helix H7. Helix H7 is an integral part of the BsFtsZ structure and bridges the N- and C-terminal domains
of FtsZ. Helix H7 in turn is anchored to the N- and C-terminal regions
through H-bonded interactions between residues Arg29 and Asn188 and
residues Gly196 and Asn263, respectively. Interestingly, all four of these residues were involved in the binding
interactions of SB-RA-2001 with BsFtsZ. It is therefore
predicted that the absence of the H-bonded interactions might have
ruptured the interactions between N- and C-terminal domains. A similar
mechanism of action was reported for the FtsZ-polymerizing agent,
PC190723, in which the compound promoted FtsZ assembly and bound to
a region similar to that of SB-RA-2001. Docking analysis suggested
SB-RA-2001 and PC190723 may bind to analogous binding pockets on FtsZ
(Figure  and Table ), indicating a common mechanism of action for the two inhibitors.
Moreover, PC190723 was reported to bind to FtsZ at a site that was
comparable to the paclitaxel binding site in tubulin, and like the
tubulin polymerization enhancing activity of paclitaxel, PC190723
also enhances the assembly of FtsZ. An analysis of the superimposition
studies indicated that like PC190723, SB-RA-2001 also binds to FtsZ
at a site that is similar to the paclitaxel binding domain in tubulin
(Figure S8 of the ). Therefore, SB-RA-2001 may stabilize FtsZ polymers through a mechanism
that is similar to the mechanism of action of paclitaxel on microtubules.

The increased cell length of B. subtilis and M. smegmatis in the presence of SB-RA-2001 indicated that
the compound inhibits cytokinesis in bacterial cells. Immunofluorescence
experiments showed that SB-RA-2001 treatment perturbed Z-ring formation
in B. subtilis 168 cells, and the number of Z-rings
per unit cell length was considerably reduced in SB-RA-2001-treated
cells. However, there was no change in nucleoid segregation, indicating
that SB-RA-2001 did not target DNA in bacterial cells. Because the
Z-ring is capable of generating force for bacterial cell division,
its perturbation can block bacterial cell division, leading to elongated B. subtilis 168 cells. We also
found that upon SB-RA-2001 treatment, DivIVA was no longer recruited
to the future cell division sites and was concentrated at the cell
poles of B. subtilis cells. This finding suggested
that DivIVA did not associate with the perturbed FtsZ ring wherein
significant membrane constriction is absent. The structural role of
DivIVA in the cell division of Gram-positive bacteria by recruiting
other proteins to cell division sites has also been reported., DivIVA was also reported to have essential roles in chromosome segregation
and cell wall synthesis. Moreover, the
division site selection mechanism of the MinCD system was found to
be regulated by DivIVA through an interacting protein MinJ. An analysis of the structural domains of DivIVA
revealed that it consists of a lipid binding N-terminal domain and
a C-terminal domain. While transmembrane
protein MinJ was found to interact with the N-terminal domain of DivIVA,
the C-terminal domain was involved in the binding interactions of
RacA, a protein essential for chromosome segregation under sporulation
conditions. The perturbed localization
of DivIVA in SB-RA-2001-treated B. subtilis cells
indicated the formation of defective FtsZ rings. Spo0J is an initiation
marker for DNA segregation in B. subtilis cells at
the onset of DNA duplication. The localization
pattern of Spo0J was unaffected by the SB-RA-2001 treatment, indicating
that the initiation of DNA replication was not hampered in the presence
of SB-RA-2001. In addition, flow cytometric analysis indicated that
DNA duplication was not stalled in the presence of SB-RA-2001 and
the elongated cells harbored more copies of the nucleoids. In addition,
the frequency of occurrence of nucleoids per micrometer of cell length
was similar in both untreated and SB-RA-2001-treated cells, and DAPI
staining of the SB-RA-2001-treated B. subtilis 168
cells indicated that the nucleoid segregation was not detectably perturbed
in most of the cells. However, the possibility of some of the SB-RA-2001-treated
elongated cells containing uneven DNA mass cannot be ruled out. The
results suggested that SB-RA-2001 inhibited Z-ring formation by promoting
FtsZ assembly and hyperstabilizing FtsZ polymers. In addition, half-maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of SB-RA-2001 on bacterial
cell and mammalian cell proliferation were determined to be 20 ±
1 and 45 ± 5 μM, respectively, indicating that SB-RA-2001
has more activity toward bacterial cells. The results together suggest
that SB-RA-2001 would serve as a lead molecule and that further modification
of its structure could help in the development of a potent taxane-based
FtsZ-targeted antibacterial drug. In fact, C-seco analogues of SB-RA-2001
have been reported to be equally active against drug-sensitive and
drug-resistant Mtb strains with negligible cytotoxicity., Accordingly, it would be interesting and beneficial to investigate
their activities and mechanism of action against various pathogens
that are serious concerns to human health.
