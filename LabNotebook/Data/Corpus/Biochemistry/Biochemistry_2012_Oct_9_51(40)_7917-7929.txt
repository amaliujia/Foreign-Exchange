Adenylyl cyclase (AC) synthesizes
the ubiquitous second messenger, cAMP, which is fundamental for numerous
physiological processes in the cell. Nine membrane-bound AC isoforms
have been cloned and characterized in mammals. They are all activated
by Gsα; however, each isoform is also differentially
regulated by other signals, such as Ca2+ and protein kinases. Type 1 and 8 ACs (AC1 and AC8, respectively)
are the two isoforms that are directly stimulated by physiological
concentrations of Ca2+ in a mechanism that requires the
mediation of calmodulin (CaM). AC1 and AC8 thus play central roles
in imparting sophisticated outcomes to the activation of Ca2+ signaling. Despite their similarities in terms of Ca2+-CaM stimulation, the kinetics of these two enzymes in response to
a modest Ca2+ entry differed significantly. The cAMP increase in cells expressing AC1 was slower than
in cells expressing AC8, although AC1 is more sensitive to Ca2+ than AC8 (EC50 values of AC1 and AC8 in vitro
of 150 and 560 nM, respectively). Moreover, AC8 gave rise to cAMP
oscillations in response to CCh-evoked Ca2+ oscillation, whereas AC1 activity yielded only a steady cAMP
increase. These kinetic differences are
thought to be at least partially due to the distinct CaM regulation
of these two enzymes.

CaM is a small (16.7 kDa) ubiquitous protein,
which is widely distributed
and involved in the regulation of more than 300 Ca2+-dependent
processes in eukaryotic cells, including
shaping levels of second messengers and components of the actin cytoskeleton.
CaM comprises globular N- and C-terminal lobes (N-lobe and C-lobe,
respectively) separated by a long flexible α-helical linker.
Each lobe contains a pair of EF-hands: EF1 and EF2 in the N-lobe and
EF3 and EF4 in the C-lobe. The introduction
of mutations into each EF-hand to impair Ca2+ binding has
provided valuable research tools for investigating the interaction
of CaM with its targets. Mutation of the first aspartate residue at
each EF-hand (D20, D56, D93, and D129) to alanine produces a mutant
CaM, CaM1234, which is at least 100-fold less sensitive
to Ca2+ than wild-type CaM (CaMWT)., Alanine substitutions in EF1 and EF2 or EF3 and EF4 alone have generated
CaM12 and CaM34 to allow separate investigation
of the roles of the C- and N-lobe CaM, respectively.,

The CaM binding domains (CaMBDs) of AC1 and AC8 are located
at
relatively different places in the molecules; AC1 has an amphipathic
CaM binding domain in the C1b domain,,, whereas AC8 has an amphipathic CaMBD at the N-terminus
and an IQ-like motif (IQlm) in the C2b domain. The N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 is not absolutely
required for stimulation of catalytic activity by Ca2+ in
vitro; CaM activates AC8 via the C2b domain by a disinhibitory mechanism.
Removal of the C2b domain makes AC8 insensitive to Ca2+ but superactive., The N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 appears
to act as a CaM tethering site, because exogenous CaM is needed to
permit stimulation by Ca2+ when the N-terminus is truncated, and even when the critical C-terminal CaMBD
is mutated, the consequences are not apparent unless the N-terminus
has been either deleted or mutated so that it can no longer bind CaM. The activation mechanism of AC1 is distinct
from that of AC8; mutagenesis studies identified a key residue within
the C1b domain responsible for Ca2+ regulation of AC1, although the point mutation of this residue
did not prevent CaM from binding to this region of AC1.

In a previous study using Ca2+-binding
mutants of CaM,
we discovered lobe-specific regulation by CaM of AC1 and AC8; no CaM
mutant could regulate AC1, while partially liganded CaM could regulate
AC8. The N-lobe mutant of CaM inhibited
AC8 activity by competing with endogenous CaM at the N-terminus, and
the C-lobe mutant of CaM stimulated AC8 through the C2b domain. The
regulation by half-liganded CaM, however, does not signify that CaMBDs
of AC8 directly bind CaM with two Ca2+ ions bound, as it
could be a consequence of an indirect interaction. Additionally, the
lack of regulation of AC1 by half-occupied CaM may possibly be due
to an interaction of CaMBD of AC1 with the wrong lobe of CaM, resulting
in an unproductive complex that renders catalysis impossible.

This study addressed potential differences in CaM regulatory mechanisms
by interrogating lobe-specific interaction of CaM with the CaMBDs
of AC1 and AC8. This was achieved using a number of experimental approaches.
First, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down
assays and offline nanoelectrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry
(MS) demonstrated their Ca2+-dependent interactions. Second,
offline nano-ESI-MS revealed the relative binding affinities of the
CaMBD peptides of AC1 and AC8 for CaM. Lastly, stopped-flow measurements
explored the binding of CaM to CaMBDs of AC1 and AC8 and how they
influenced the affinity of each lobe of CaM for Ca2+. A
previous mutagenesis study of AC8 had allowed the formulation of a
model in which CaM tethered at the N-terminal CaMBD might be transferred
to the first half of the C-terminal CaMBD of AC8. Results from this study help to expand this model and to
generate a contrasting model for AC1. Overall, we have revealed yet
more distinctions between the mechanisms of the CaM activation of
these two enzymes, which illustrates the elaborate complexity of the
Ca2+ regulation of ACs.

Experimental Procedures
Materials
ECL Plus Western Blotting Analysis System,
Hyperfilm, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and the pGEX4T-1 vector were
obtained from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, U.K.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG and DNase were from Promega (Madison, WI). TALON
resin was from BD Clontech (Basingstoke, U.K.). Monoclonal CaM antibody
was from Upstate Biotechnology (Dundee, U.K.). M13 was from Cambridge
Bioscience (Cambridge, U.K.). Constructs of CaM mutants were gifts
from J. H. Caldwell (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center,
Denver, CO). Peptides were synthesized by S. Rothemund (IZKF Leipzig,
Leipzig, Germany) or JPT Peptide Technologies (Berlin, Germany). All
other reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, U.K.) unless stated
otherwise.

In Vitro Measurement of Adenylyl Cyclase Activity
Determination
of AC activity in vitro was performed as described previously with some modifications. Crude membranes isolated
from HEK293 cells transfected with either AC1 or AC8 were washed twice
with buffer containing excess EGTA to remove Ca2+ and CaM
prior to the assay. AC activity was measured in the presence of the
following components: 12 mM phosphocreatine, 2.5 units of creatine
phosphokinase, 100 μM cAMP, 1.4 mM MgCl2, 100 μM
ATP, 40 μM GTP, 500 μM phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine,
10 μM forskolin, 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ATP,
200 μM EGTA, 0.3 or 1 μM free Ca2+, and the
indicated concentrations of M13 to remove residual CaM. Wild-type CaM (1 μM) was included where indicated.
The reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μL) was incubated at
30 °C for 20 min, and the reactions were terminated with 0.5%
(w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. The [32P]cAMP formed was
quantified using a sequential chromatography technique. Data points are mean activities ± the standard
deviation (SD) of triplicate determinations. IC50 values,
from at least three independent experiments, are means ± SD.

Expression and Purification of His-Tagged CaM and GST Fusion
Proteins
Wild-type and mutant rat His-CaM were propagated
in XL10 Gold cells, and BL21(DE3) cells were used for propagation
of GST, GST-8Nt, GST-8C2b, and GST-1C1b. Proteins were expressed overnight
at 20 °C via induction with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed by sonication in lysis
buffer [137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 10 μM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, and
1 μg of DNAase (pH 7.4)] supplemented with 200 μg/mL lysozyme.
Homogenates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min.
The supernatant fraction was then passed through a base volume of
TALON resin (His-CaM) or glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GST) chromatography
and washed until no protein remained in the eluate (assessed by measurement
of the absorbance at 280 nm). A volume of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) [137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)] equal to the
volume of resin was used to create a 50% slurry, to which 0.02% (v/v)
sodium azide was added for storage at 4 °C.

GST Pull-Down Assays
For pull-down assays assessing
the binding of CaM to GST, GST-1C1b, GST-8Nt, and GST-8C2b, glutathione-Sepharose
4B supporting the appropriate immobilized GST or GST fusion protein
was washed three times in PBS and added to PBS supplemented with 1%
(v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 μM His-CaM, and either 20 μM CaCl2 or 200 μM EGTA. Samples were rotated for 4 h at 4 °C,
centrifuged at 2500 rpm and 4 °C for 5 min, and washed three
times in PBS. This was followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis analysis and immunoblotting with CaM (1:1000)
and GST (1:50000) antibodies following goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (1:20000), as described previously.

Stopped-Flow Measurement
Stopped-flow fluorescence
experiments were performed at 22 °C and 300 V with a drive pressure
of 3 bar, using an Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, U.K.) spectrofluorimeter
(model SX.2.0MV-R) with a dead time of 5 ms. All solutions were prepared
in MOPS buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 mM KCl and 1
mM MgCl2. The stopped volume was 100 μL after 1:1
mixing, and thus, the final concentrations in the optical chamber
are half of the values stated below. CaCl2 (20 μM)
and CaM (2 μM) alone, or combined with 2 μM peptide, were
mixed with 150 μM quin-2. The concentration of peptide sufficient
to saturate CaM was determined experimentally using various peptide
concentrations and by examining the relative change in the amplitudes.
AC1-C1b is 28 amino acids long and corresponds to residues 495–522
of bovine AC1 (Table 1 of the ). AC8-Nt and AC8-C2b are 25 amino acids long and correspond to residues
30–54 and 1187–1211, respectively, of rat AC8 (Table
1 of the ). Synthetic
peptides were &gt;95% pure, and their C-termini were protected by
amidation.
Concentrations of peptides were determined spectrophotometrically
(at 280 nm) with molar extinction coefficients of 1615 M–1 cm–1 for AC1-C1b, 5500 M–1 cm–1 for AC8-Nt, and 1490 M–1 cm–1 for AC8-C2b. The fluorescence from quin-2 was detected
using an excitation wavelength of 334 nm, controlled by a 405 nm cutoff
filter (Applied Photophysics). Although the units of fluorescences
are arbitrary (au) and the signals varied each day and drifted over
time, the rate constants and the changes in amplitude remained consistent.
Data from five to eight injections (runs) were averaged and fit with
either a single- or double-exponential function. To obtain kinetic
parameters, a mean ± SD was generated from at least three independent
averages for each type of experiment.

Offline Nano-ESI-MS Measurements
Offline nano-ESI measurements
were conducted on an LTQ-OrbitrapXL mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nano-ESI source using
metal-coated borosilicate emitters (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark). Mass
spectra of peptides were acquired in the positive ionization mode
in the m/z range of 200–2000,
and signals were deconvoluted with Xcalibur version 2.0.7 (ThermoFisher
Scientific).

Results
Removal of Endogenous CaM Inhibits AC1 and AC8 Activities
To compare the ability of AC1 and AC8 to compete for CaM, building
on a strategy used previously, we used
a high-affinity 26-mer peptide, “M13” (KRRWKKNFIAVSAANRFKKISSSGAL),
derived from rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (Kd ∼ 0.2 nM) as a “CaM sponge” to remove endogenous CaM from the
membranes of HEK cells expressing AC1 and AC8. Crude membranes were washed with excess EGTA to remove free and
weakly bound Ca2+-CaM prior to the assay, and the activities
of AC1 and AC8 were measured in the presence of 10 μM forskolin,
Ca2+, and increasing concentrations of M13. The values
of [Ca2+]free that maximally stimulated AC1
(0.3 μM) and AC8 (1 μM) were chosen. Data were converted
into the percentage of maximal activity in the absence of M13 to directly
compare the inhibition of AC1 and AC8. M13 inhibited AC1 and AC8 equally
in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of
0.044 ± 0.005 μM (n = 3) and 0.048 ±
0.010 μM (n = 4), respectively (Figure A). Their activities were effectively inhibited
by 1 μM M13 in the absence of added CaM (Figure A); however, in the presence of 1 μM exogenous CaM,
this (IC50) concentration was largely ineffective (Figure B). The IC50 values were increased to
1.56 ± 0.16 μM (n = 5) for AC1 and 1.53
± 0.21 μM (n = 5) for AC8 in the presence
of CaM. These results clearly show that AC1 and AC8 compete for CaM
equally in vitro at the level of AC activity.

Effect of M13 on Ca2+ regulation of AC1 and AC8 in vitro.
Adenylyl cyclase activities of AC1 (orange squares) and AC8 (green
triangles) were measured with an increasing concentration of M13 in
the absence (A) or presence (B) of 1 μM exogenous CaM. The data
were normalized to the maximal activity in the absence of M13 as 100%
and the minimal activity with 10 μM M13 as 0%. Data are plotted
as means ± SD and are representative of at least three experiments.

The Interaction of CaM with AC1 and AC8 Is Ca2+-Dependent
Direct binding of CaM to the CaMBDs of AC1 and AC8 was first assessed
by GST pull-down assays. GST was N-terminally fused to the C1b domain
of AC1 (GST-1C1b) or the N-terminus (GST-8Nt) or C2b domain (GST-8C2b)
of AC8. GST-1C1b contains 68 amino acid residues from Ser-481 to Leu-548
of bovine AC1 (Table 1 of the ). The GST fusion proteins for AC8 previously used comprised residues
1–96 (N-terminal CaMBD) and 1106–1248 (C-terminal CaMBD)
of rat AC8. To confirm any interactions
with a higher level of specificity, shorter GST-8Nt (residues 1–77) and GST-8C2b (residues 1183–1248), which are similar in length to GST-1C1b, were
used (Table 1 of the ). Each GST fusion protein was incubated with 0.5 μM CaM in
the presence of either 200 μM EGTA or 20 μM Ca2+. Even at high levels, GST alone did not bind CaM, showing the absence
of a nonspecific interaction (Figure ). GST-8Nt,
GST-8C2b, and GST-1C1b, on the other hand, pulled down CaM, and their
interactions were clearly dependent on Ca2+ (Figure ).

Interaction between CaM and GST-tagged CaMBDs of AC1 and
AC8. Binding
of CaM to GST (26 kDa), the N-terminus of AC8 (GST-8Nt, 34.5 kDa),
the C2b domain of AC8 (GST-8C2b, 33.5 kDa), and the C1b domain of
AC1 (GST-1C1b, 33.3 kDa) was assessed by a GST pull-down assay with
either 200 μM EGTA (−Ca2+) or 20 μM
Ca2+ (+Ca2+). Inclusion of 0.5 μM CaMWT is indicated as +CaM. The horizontal lines indicate CaM
input (1%) or different GST fusion proteins used in the assay. The
top blot shows the expression of GST, and the bottom blot shows the
CaM pulled down. A representative experiment of three is shown.

The Ca2+-dependent interaction between
CaM and CaMBDs
of AC1 and AC8 was explored more quantitatively by offline nano-ESI-MS
measurements. ESI-MS allows the determination of noncovalent interactions
between CaM and its target peptides.− Mass spectrometry is not a quantitative
technique as the signal intensities depend on the ionization efficiency
of the respective molecule. Moreover, absolute signal intensities
can vary between different ESI-MS measurements. As such, it is not
possible to use absolute MS signal intensities for quantification.
Thus, the signal intensities of the CaM·peptide complexes are
given as a fraction of the total intensity of all CaM species. Experiments
were performed in a solution containing 10 μM CaM and 10 μM
peptide (Table 1 of the ) with either 200 μM EGTA or 1 mM Ca2+. In the presence
of EGTA, all three peptides bound Ca2+-loaded CaM (Figure C,E,G). This confirms that the affinity of CaM for
Ca2+ becomes higher when a CaMBD peptide binds CaM, as
there was no MS signal visible for Ca2+-loaded CaM in the
absence of a peptide (Figure A). ESI-MS data
can also be used to compare the relative affinities of CaM for ligands,, including CaMBD peptides. The peak
intensities of Ca2+-CaM·peptide complexes were higher
for all three peptides in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ than
the peak intensities of CaM (Figure D,F,H),
compared to those observed in the presence of EGTA (Figure C,E,G). For AC1-C1b and AC8-Nt peptides, the signals
of non-peptide-bound CaM were not even visible in the presence of
Ca2+ (Figure D,F). This confirms
the higher affinities of all three peptides for CaM in the presence
of Ca2+. In the absence of added Ca2+, the peak
ratio of the Ca2+-CaM·peptide complex to CaM was the
highest with AC1-C1b and the lowest with AC8-C2b (Figure C,E,G), showing the order of the relative affinities for partially
loaded CaM was as follows: AC1-C1b &gt; AC8-Nt &gt; AC8-C2b. In excess
Ca2+, CaM binds four Ca2+ ions, yet we also
observed
adducts of CaM with more than four Ca2+ ions in ESI-MS
experiments (Figure B). This is explained
by the auxiliary cation binding sites that CaM possesses in addition
to the four high-affinity sites, as shown
by other ESI experiments.,,, When the mass spectra were recorded
with AC8-C2b and 1 mM Ca2+, there were two signals corresponding
to free CaM and peptide-bound CaM with four to eight Ca2+ ions (Figure H). In contrast, there was
no signal for free CaM when AC1-C1b or AC8-Nt was used (Figure D,F), demonstrating that all CaM molecules in the
solution formed a complex with these two peptides in the presence
of Ca2+. This result illustrated the stronger binding of
fully occupied CaM to these two peptides than to AC8-C2b.

Interaction
between CaM and peptides derived from CaMBDs of AC1
and AC8. Offline nano-ESI-MS measurements were performed with 10 μM
CaM alone (A and B) or in the presence of 10 μM AC1-C1b (C and
D), AC8-Nt (E and F), or AC8-C2b (G and H). The measurements were
performed with either 200 μM EGTA (A, C, E, and G) or 1 mM Ca2+ (B, D, F, and H). Deconvoluted mass spectra are presented.
The Ca2+-free condition used 200 μM EGTA to mimic
the AC assay conditions, which yields negligible concentrations of
free Ca2+.

Lobe-Specific Interaction of CaM with CaMBDs of AC1 and AC8
Offline nano-ESI-MS measurement showed that partially liganded
CaM interacted with all three peptides. To understand the lobe-specific
interaction of CaM, the ability of CaM mutants to bind the GST fusion
proteins was then investigated. None of the CaM species were pulled
down by GST alone (Figure A), despite the
robust expression of GST (Figure 1A of the ). GST-1C1b interacted with only CaMWT and not with any CaM mutants (Figure B).
This result suggests that the absence of regulation by partially liganded
CaM was due to the inability of the CaM
mutants to interact with the CaMBD of AC1. In other words, Ca2+ binding in both lobes of CaM is required for interaction
and, by inference, regulation of AC1. In contrast, GST-8Nt and GST-8C2b
could pull down partially loaded CaM. GST-8Nt interacted with CaM12 as well as CaMWT in a Ca2+-dependent
manner (Figure C). The interaction between
the C-lobe-occupied CaM and the N-terminus of AC8 mirrored functional
data observed previously. The result suggests
that the preassociation with the N-terminus of AC8 requires at least
two Ca2+ ions bound at the C-lobe, although the interaction
is enhanced when two more Ca2+ ions bind to the N-lobe.
GST-8C2b pulled down CaM34 as well as CaMWT (Figure D). The intensity of the CaM34 band was
higher than that of the CaMWT band. Hence, CaM requires
only two Ca2+ ions bound at the N-lobe to bind to the C-terminal
CaMBD of AC8. CaM1234 did not bind to any of the GST fusion
proteins, showing that apo-CaM cannot bind to these three CaMBDs.

Interaction
between different CaM species and CaMBDs of AC1 and
AC8. The left panels show data for binding of CaM mutants to GST (A),
GST-1C1b (B), GST-8Nt (C), and GST-8C2b (D) was assessed by a GST
pull-down assay with either 200 μM EGTA (−Ca2+) or 20 μM Ca2+ (+Ca2+). The horizontal
lines indicate different species of CaM (0.5 μM) included in
the assay or CaM input (1%). The right panels show signal intensities
quantified using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD). The level of CaM pulled down was expressed as a band density
relative to the GST intensity (Figure 1 of the ) and each CaM input and normalized
to the level of CaM1234 with EGTA of each blot. Data are
plotted as means ± the standard error of the mean and are an
average of three experiments.

Ca2+ Dissociation Kinetics of CaM
The interaction
between each lobe of CaM and the CaMBDs of AC1 and AC8 revealed by
the GST pull-down assay supported their lobe-specific regulation revealed
previously. However, this approach is
quite undiscerning, and the effect that each CaMBD exerts on CaM could
not be compared. In addition, the association between partially liganded
CaM and the C1b domain of AC1 observed using ESI-MS measurement could
not be explained. Therefore, stopped-flow kinetic measurement was
employed to more precisely explore the lobe-specific interaction of
CaM. Ca2+ binding influences the ability of CaM to interact
with target proteins. Likewise, interaction
with target proteins affects the affinity of CaM for Ca2+., Stopped-flow kinetic studies indicate that
the increased affinity of CaM is largely due to a reduction in the
Ca2+ dissociation rate constant in Ca2+-CaM·peptide/protein
complexes, while the calculated Ca2+ association rate constant
is not altered in many cases. Accordingly,
rates of dissociation of Ca2+ from numerous complexes have
been examined to gain insights into their particular interactions.
Determining the Ca2+ dissociation rate constants by stopped-flow
kinetic studies is especially instructive as Ca2+ ions
dissociate from CaM in two steps, one from each lobe. The C-lobe of
CaM has a higher affinity for Ca2+ than the N-lobe; subsequently,
dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-lobe is slower than that
from the N-lobe. In the presence of the CaMBD peptide, dissociation
of Ca2+ from CaM not only is slowed but also takes place
in two or more steps, from which the important lobe(s) for the target
interaction can be inferred.

The rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from the N- and C-lobes of CaM can be measured by monitoring
quin-2 fluorescence in stopped-flow measurements.− Because of
its high affinity for Ca2+ (Kd ∼ 60 nM), quin-2 rapidly binds
all Ca2+ ions within the dead time of the spectrofluorimeter
when micromolar concentrations of quin-2 and Ca2+ are mixed. The very fast on rate of quin-2 is ideal, as
an increase in fluorescence detected in the stopped-flow apparatus
correlates directly with the amount of chelated Ca2+ released
from CaM, but not free Ca2+. When mixed with 20 μM
Ca2+ and 2 μM CaM1234, quin-2 also chelated
Ca2+ within the dead time, and no change in the fluorescence
was observed (data not shown), confirming that the aspartate to alanine
substitution in each EF-hand Ca2+-binding loop was sufficient
to preclude Ca2+ binding. Although CaM-target peptides
can restore some Ca2+ binding by CaM mutants, stopped-flow measurement did not show the change
in the fluorescence in the presence of CaM1234 and CaMBD
peptides (data not shown), and thus, we assumed that the Ca2+ dissociations observed under this condition were from the EF-hands
that were not mutated.

Because the N-lobe of CaM releases Ca2+ very rapidly,
the kinetics of dissociation of Ca2+ from CaMWT was readily fit with a single-exponential function with a rate constant
of 8.0 ± 0.3 s–1 [n = 5 (Figure A)], displaying the rate only from the C-lobe of
CaM. An equivalent rate constant was obtained with CaM12, showing a koff value of 8.1 ±
0.2 s–1 [n = 4 (Figure B)]. The changes in the relative quin-2 fluorescence
as a result of the release of Ca2+ from CaMWT and CaM12 were also similar (0.064 ± 0.016 and 0.061
± 0.005, respectively). Therefore, the mutation in the N-lobe
did not compromise the ability of the C-lobe to interact with Ca2+. Because the C-lobe of CaM contains two EF-hands that bind
a Ca2+ ion each, the change in the amplitude of ∼0.06
was assumed to correspond to two Ca2+ ions released from
CaM.

Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of CaM in the absence of
peptide. Dissociation of Ca2+ from CaMWT (A),
CaM12 (B), and CaM34 (C) was measured by monitoring
changes in quin-2 fluorescence. Quin-2 (150 μM) was rapidly
mixed with 20 μM Ca2+ and 2 μM CaM. The inset
of panel C shows the close-up trace of dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM34 from 0 to 0.04 s. Each trace that represents
an average of five to eight runs was fit using a single-exponential
function. Data are representative of at least four experiments.

Because of its high off rate, Ca2+ released
from the
N-lobe of CaM and free Ca2+ are chelated by quin-2 within
the dead time of the spectrofluorimeter, and thus, the fluorescence
change cannot be observed unless the temperature is lowered to ∼10
°C.,, The C-lobe
mutant of CaM, however, caused an increase in quin-2 fluorescence
at 22 °C. Ca2+ dissociated from the N-lobe of CaM34 with a koff value of 195 ±
30 s–1 [n = 8 (Figure C)], in good agreement with an earlier study. The relative amplitude was only 0.030 ± 0.009, implying
that one Ca2+ ion was released with the rate constant observed
and that the other Ca2+ release event was too fast to be
measured. Because the mutation within the EF-hands in the C-lobe affected
the Ca2+ dissociation property of the N-lobe, we interpreted
the data using CaM34 to examine the interaction between
Ca2+ and the N-lobe of CaM with caution. Table  summarizes the rate constants and the change in
the amplitude of dissociation of Ca2+ from CaMWT, CaM12, and CaM34.

Ca2+ dissociation
kinetics were determined by measuring changes in quin-2 fluorescence
at 22 °C and fit with a single- or double-exponential function.
The average rate constants for Ca2+ dissociation and the
amplitude are presented as means ± SD of three to eight independent
experiments. A change in the relative amplitude of 0.03 corresponds
to a release of one Ca2+ ion, and the number of Ca2+ ions released is shown in parentheses. The rate constant
for Ca2+ dissociation, which was too fast to measure, is
shown as &gt;500.

Effect of CaMBD Peptides on the Release of Ca2+ from
the N-Lobe of CaM34
Separating the role of each
lobe of CaMWT can be difficult, as each target peptide
interacts with CaM differently. The use of CaM mutants can overcome
this issue and clarify how each lobe is influenced by peptides. For
that reason, the effect of peptides on CaM mutants was established
before examining the Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of wild-type
CaM, to identify the rate that corresponds to each lobe’s action.
CaM34 was first used to assess how the CaMBD peptides derived
from AC1 and AC8 influence the ability of the N-lobe of CaM to interact
with Ca2+. CaM34 can only bind Ca2+ at the N-lobe because of the mutations within EF3 and EF4 in the
C-lobe and hence should provide a means of measuring the rate of dissociation
of Ca2+ from the N-lobe, exclusive of the influence of
Ca2+ binding events that take place at the C-lobe. The
GST pull-down assay showed a strong interaction between CaM34 and GST-8C2b, but not GST-8Nt or GST-1C1b (panels D, C, and B of
Figure , respectively). Therefore, an effect
of AC8-C2b on the release of Ca2+ from CaM34 was expected, and accordingly, the impact that the C-terminal CaMBD
of AC8 has on dissociation of Ca2+ from the N-lobe of CaM
could be determined.

CaM34 releases one Ca2+ ion at a rate that is too fast to be measured under this condition
(koff &gt; 500 s–1)
and
another one with a koff value of ∼200
s–1, when mixed with quin-2 (Table ). Thus, Ca2+ dissociates from CaM34 very rapidly; even the slower Ca2+ dissociation event
is completed within the first 50 ms. Surprisingly, the rapid release
of Ca2+ from the N-lobe of CaM34 was slowed
not only by AC8-C2b but also by AC1-C1b and AC8-Nt (Figure A). All the data fit well to a single-exponential
function (Figure 2A of the ), which gave rate constants of 5.6 ± 0.6, 67 ± 10, and
3.5 ± 0.6 s–1 in the presence of AC1-C1b, AC8-Nt,
and AC8-C2b, respectively [n = 3 (Figure A and Table )]. The relative
amplitudes of dissociation of Ca2+ from the CaM34·AC1-C1b and CaM34·AC8-Nt complexes were 0.032
± 0.007 and 0.027 ± 0.004, respectively [n = 3 (Figure A and Table )], demonstrating the involvement of only one EF-hand. Although
the presence of AC8-Nt slowed the release of Ca2+ from
one EF-hand of CaM34, the koff value of ∼70 s–1 indicates a very weak,
possibly transient interaction that could not be detected by the GST
pull-down assay.

Effect of peptides on the Ca2+ dissociation
kinetics
of CaM mutants. Dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM34 (A) or CaM12 (B) in the absence or presence of peptide
was measured by monitoring changes in quin-2 fluorescence. Quin-2
(150 μM) was rapidly mixed with 20 μM Ca2+ and
2 μM CaM in the absence or presence of 2 μM peptide. Each
trace, which represents an average of five to eight runs, was fit
using a single-exponential (A) or double-exponential (B) function.
Representative experiments of three are shown.

In contrast to AC8-Nt, AC1-C1b and AC8-C2b reduced
the speed of
dissociation of Ca2+ from CaM34 considerably.
A weak interaction caused by the involvement of only one EF-hand may
explain why the GST pull-down assay showed no interaction between
CaM34 and GST-1C1b (Figure B).
Unlike AC1-C1b, AC8-C2b influenced both EF-hands in the N-lobe of
CaM34. The change in the relative quin-2 fluorescence was
0.049 ± 0.006 in the presence of AC8-C2b [n =
3 (Figure A and Table )], illustrating that Ca2+ ions were released from both
EF-hands in the N-lobe slowly. The cooperativity of the EF-hand pair
was also restored, as the data could be fit only using a single-exponential
function. Therefore, the C-terminal CaMBD of AC8 has a dramatic effect
on the rate constants for dissociation of Ca2+ from the
N-lobe of CaM.

Effect of CaMBD Peptides on the Release of Ca2+ from
the C-Lobe of CaM12
Only GST-8Nt bound CaM12 (Figure C), and thus, AC8-Nt is
expected to consolidate the ability of CaM12 to grasp Ca2+ in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator. CaM12 has a functional C-lobe; its Ca2+ dissociation
kinetics can be determined accurately by monitoring quin-2 fluorescence.
The release of Ca2+ from CaM12 alone gave a
rate constant of ∼8 s–1, because of a slower
off rate from the C-lobe, compared to CaM34, which contains
a functional N-lobe. In the presence of peptides, the data were best
fit with a double exponential (Figure 2C of the ), as a single-exponential function
failed to fit early time points (Figure 2B of the ). The Ca2+ dissociation
kinetics of each CaM12·peptide complex had two rates.
However, for CaM12 in complex with AC8-C2b, the two kinetic
phases were similar; the major fast phase had a koff1 value of 8.5 ± 1.2 s–1, with
an amplitude of 0.043 ± 0.007, while the koff2 value was 3.8 ± 1.3 s–1, with an
amplitude of 0.021 ± 0.001 [n = 3 (Figure B and Table )]. This result
indicates that ∼1.5 mol of Ca2+ ions dissociates
from the C-lobe with a rate almost identical to that observed in the
absence of a peptide. In addition, the koff2 value, which showed ∼0.5 mol of Ca2+ released,
is not very different from the koff1 value.
The single-exponential fit, although not as good as the double-exponential
fit, gave a rate constant of 7.0 ± 1.3 s–1 with
an amplitude of 0.054 ± 0.004 (n = 3). Thus,
the effect of AC8-C2b on Ca2+ binding of the C-lobe, if
any, is minimal.

AC1-C1b and AC8-Nt had more influence on the
release of Ca2+ from the C-lobe of CaM12 (Figure B). The curves were clearly biphasic, and data were
fit to a double-exponential function. Rates of dissociation of Ca2+ from the CaM12·AC1-C1b complex were 5.2
± 1.0 and 0.8 ± 0.3 s–1, corresponding
to the release of Ca2+ from each EF-hand in the C-lobe
[n = 3 (Figure B and Table )]. The marked reduction of the Ca2+ dissociation
rate constants suggests an interaction between the C-lobe of CaM and
the CaMBD of AC1, even though CaM12 was not pulled down
by GST-1C1b (Figure B). However, as expected
from the GST pull-down assay, the interaction of CaM12 with
the N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 appears to be even stronger. Ca2+ dissociated with a rate constant of 4.2 ± 1.0 s–1 from one EF-hand and 0.3 ± 0.1 s–1 from the
other EF-hand in the C-lobe [n = 3 (Figure B and Table )].

Effect of CaMBD Peptides on the Release of Ca2+ from
CaMWT
Stopped-flow measurements with CaM mutants
hitherto showed each lobe of CaM interacts differently with each peptide.
Dissociation of Ca2+ from the N-lobe of CaM is slowed by
AC1-C1b and even more by AC8-C2b. On the other hand, AC1-C1b and AC8-Nt,
in particular, reduced the rate of release of Ca2+ from
the C-lobe of CaM. To establish whether the interaction of each lobe
observed was genuine or a consequence of the mutation in the other
lobe, the Ca2+ dissociation kinetics was examined using
CaMWT. In the absence of peptide, CaMWT releases
Ca2+ with a rate constant of ∼8 s–1. In the presence of a peptide, a single-exponential function did
not fit the data (Figure 2D of the ), and subsequently, a double-exponential function
was used (Figure 2E of the ).

The Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of the CaMWT·AC1-C1b complex exhibited 2 mol of Ca2+ dissociated
with a koff of 8.0 ± 0.6 s–1 and 1 mol dissociated with a koff of
1.2 ± 0.3 s–1 [n = 3 (Figure A and Table )]. The total
change in the relative quin-2 fluorescence corresponds to 3 mol of
Ca2+ ions released, and thus, 1 mol of Ca2+ was
assumed to be released at &gt;500 s–1 from one EF-hand
in the N-lobe, which was too fast to be measured. The slow koff2 was assigned to the rate of dissociation
of Ca2+ from one of the EF-hands in the C-lobe, based on
the koff2 of the CaM12·AC1-C1b
complex. Consequently, the koff1 represents
the rate constant for the release of Ca2+ from one EF-hand
in each lobe of CaM. In summary, CaMWT in complex with
AC1-C1b exhibited Ca2+ dissociation rate constants of &gt;500
and ∼8 s–1 for the N-lobe and ∼8 and
∼1 s–1 for the C-lobe.

Effect of peptides on
Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of
CaMWT. (A) Dissociation of Ca2+ from CaMWT in the absence or presence of a peptide was measured by
monitoring changes in quin-2 fluorescence. Quin-2 (150 μM) was
rapidly mixed with 20 μM Ca2+ and 2 μM CaMWT in the absence or presence 2 μM peptide. Each trace
that represents an average of five to eight runs was fit using a double-exponential
function. A representative experiment of three is shown. (B) Summary
showing the effect of AC1-C1b, AC8-Nt, and AC8-C2b on the rate constants
for dissociation of Ca2+ from CaMWT. Ca2+ dissociates from the N- and C-lobes of peptide-free CaMWT with rate constants of &gt;500 and 8 s–1,
respectively, at 22 °C. When CaMWT binds to AC1-C1b,
the rate of dissociation of Ca2+ from one EF-hand of the
N-lobe is decreased to 8 s–1, and that for one EF-hand
of the C-lobe is reduced to 1 s–1, without affecting
the other EF-hand in each lobe. AC8-Nt reduced the rate of release
of Ca2+ from the C-lobe of CaM only to 5 and 0.5 s–1. AC8-C2b influenced dissociation of Ca2+ only from the N-lobe of CaM at a rate of 2 s–1.

The CaMWT·AC8-Nt complex displayed
Ca2+ dissociation rate constants of 4.9 ± 0.9 and
0.5 ± 0.2
s–1 with amplitudes of 0.029 ± 0.008 and 0.027
± 0.007, respectively [n = 3 (Figure A and Table )], corresponding
to the release of two Ca2+ ions. The rate constants measured
with CaMWT were both concluded to correspond to the release
of Ca2+ from the C-lobe of CaM, because they were very
similar to the koff1 and koff2 of the CaM12·AC8-Nt complex [∼4
and ∼0.3 s–1, respectively (Table )]. Additionally, AC8-Nt did not affect dissociation
of Ca2+ from the N-lobe of CaM34 to a great
extent (Figure A), and hence, Ca2+ was presumed to be released from both EF-hands in the N-lobe with
a koff of &gt;500 s–1.

In contrast with AC8-Nt, AC8-C2b influenced the ability of
the
N-lobe of CaM34 (Figure A), but
not the C-lobe of CaM12 (Figure B), to interact with Ca2+. The release of Ca2+ from the CaMWT·AC8-C2b complex was biphasic with
a koff1 value of 8.4 ± 1.1 s–1 and a koff2 value of
1.6 ± 0.6 s–1 [n = 3 (Figure A and Table )]. Unlike CaMWT in complex with AC1-C1b or AC8-Nt, in which the stopped-flow
measurement detected 3 or 2 mol of Ca2+ released, respectively,
the relative amplitude was increased to ∼0.12 in the complex
with AC8-C2b (Figure A), demonstrating that
all four Ca2+ ions were released slowly, which can be measured
by the spectrofluorimeter under this condition. Each rate constant
was assumed to correspond to each lobe based on the Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of CaM34 and CaM12,
and we concluded that the N-lobe of CaM released Ca2+ with
the slower koff2 rate by interacting with
AC8-C2b, while the C-lobe released Ca2+ with the koff1 rate, which was not affected because of
the deficiency in associating with the peptide.

Discussion
Lobe independence and linker flexibility
make CaM an exceptional
Ca2+ sensor protein that interacts with a wide range of
proteins. The use of Ca2+-binding
deficient CaM mutants has revealed the regulation of a number of proteins
by partially liganded CaM. For example, the C-lobe of CaM plays a
key role in activating Bacillus anthracis exotoxin and Ca2+-CaM-dependent protein kinase
II (CaMKII), although CaMKII interacts
with the N-lobe first before interacting with the C-lobe., On the other hand, Ca2+-independent tethering of small-conductance
Ca2+-activated potassium (SK) channels requires the C-lobe
of CaM, while Ca2+-dependent channel gating requires only
the N-lobe of CaM. The Ca2+-mediated activation mechanism of SK channels is considered to be
distinct from classical mechanisms because of the involvement of two
subunits forming a dimer, yet the action
of CaM in regulating AC8 may be more similar to that of SK channels
than AC1, because AC8 tethers the C-lobe of CaM and is activated by
the N-lobe of CaM. This study confirms
that the lobe-specific regulation of CaM results from lobe-specific interactions; the stopped-flow data show
interactions of CaM liganded at both lobes with AC1-C1b, the C-lobe
occupied CaM with AC8-Nt, and the N-lobe occupied CaM with AC8-C2b,
as summarized in Figure B. As demonstrated
by connexin32, examining the release
of Ca2+ from CaM34 (Figure 3A of the ) and CaM12 (Figure
3B of the ) allowed
the effect of the peptides on each lobe to be isolated, and this simplified
the analysis of the Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of the CaMWT·peptide complexes.

AC1-C1b influenced the ability
of both lobes of CaM to interact
with Ca2+. The interaction with AC1-C1b requires binding
of Ca2+ to one EF-hand in each lobe of CaM, which can explain
the complex of AC1-C1b with 2 mol of Ca2+-bound CaM observed
in the ESI-MS experiment but the inadequate binding of GST-1C1b with
the CaM mutants. The Ca2+ dissociation kinetics of the
CaMWT·AC1-C1b complex was similar to the “3
+ 1 kinetics” described for the CaMWT·skeletal
muscle myosin light chain kinase complex, in which one Ca2+ ion is released very fast (rate constant of &gt;500 s–1) in a manner independent of the other three Ca2+ ions. AC8-Nt slowed dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-lobe without affecting the N-lobe of CaM (Figure B). The result suggests that the interaction with
the N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 requires at least two Ca2+ ions
bound at the C-lobe of CaM. CaM often preassociates with proteins
in a manner independent of Ca2+ concentrations, as seen
with phosphorylase kinase, SK channels, and L-type, P/Q-type, and R-type Ca2+ channels. The N-terminus of AC8, however,
contains an amphipathic 1-8-14 motif, in which CaM binding is dependent
on Ca2+ as shown by GST pull-down assays (Figure ) and offline nano-ESI-MS (Figure E,F), and the association with the N-lobe mutant of CaM also
requires Ca2+ (Figure C). As suggested
for a phosphorylated form of CaMKII, AC8
may be capable of associating with partially occupied CaM at a resting
[Ca2+]i, which supports the inhibition of AC8
activity by CaM12., AC8-C2b exerts a dramatic
effect on the ability of the N-lobe of CaM to interact with Ca2+. On the basis of the GST pull-down assay and stopped-flow
measurements using the CaM mutants, the C-terminal CaMBD of AC8 was
concluded to have little influence on the C-lobe of CaM (Figure B). However, the possibility that the lobe assignment
was incorrect and that AC8-C2b caused slower release of Ca2+ from both lobes cannot be ruled out, because the slower Ca2+ dissociation rates are often considered to be the rates of the C-lobe., Even so, the reduction of the speed would be &gt;60-fold by the
N-lobe
and 5-fold by the C-lobe, and thus, AC8-C2b preferentially increases
the affinity of the N-lobe for Ca2+.

Our ESI-MS measurements
illustrated that fully liganded and partially
liganded CaM both have a higher affinity for AC1-C1b and AC8-Nt than
for AC8-C2b (Figure ). This could explain
the residual Ca2+ stimulation observed in wild-type AC1
and AC8, but not the C1b domain mutant of AC1 or the N-terminal truncation
mutant of AC8. The inhibition of their
activities by M13 (Figure ) suggests that
the ability of AC1 and AC8 to compete for CaM with other Ca2+-CaM target proteins is equivalent in vitro, regardless of the available
CaM concentrations. In the regions of the brain where AC1 and AC8
are distributed, a number of Ca2+-CaM target proteins also
reside. It appears that AC1, which has a higher affinity for Ca2+ and partially liganded CaM, has the advantage of being maximally
stimulated by the same concentrations of Ca2+-CaM. This
may be the case in vitro; however, AC8 benefits from having the additional
CaMBD that can tether C-lobe-occupied CaM in resting [Ca2+]i in vivo. Because of the very fast on rate of the N-lobe
of CaM for Ca2+, CaM is fully
liganded and AC8 is activated quickly by a Ca2+ transient.
AC1 may need to have a high affinity for Ca2+ to compensate
for the requirement of CaM with Ca2+ binding to both lobes,
as this makes AC1 less able to compete with other high-affinity CaM-binding
proteins, which sequester, tether, or compartmentalize the available
pool of CaM.

Unlike that of AC8,
little is known about the activation mechanism
of AC1. Because the CaMBD of AC1 is close to the catalytic site, AC1
is presumed to be activated by the relief of autoinhibition, like
AC8 and many protein kinases. Ca2+ saturation of one lobe
of CaM was not sufficient to interact with or regulate AC1, and thus,
we speculated that all four EF-hands of CaM need to bind Ca2+ to activate AC1. However, a more comprehensive study of stopped-flow
kinetics revealed that the binding of CaM to AC1 requires one Ca2+ ion in each lobe (Figure B). This
unusual interaction supports an earlier study of AC1 using CaM mutants
with a single-point mutation. Mutations
at EF2 and EF4 severely compromised the ability of CaM to activate
AC1, demonstrating that these two EF-hands
require Ca2+ binding. The EF1 mutant had little effect, which is consistent with our stopped-flow data
that show that one EF-hand in the N-lobe was not affected by the CaMBD
peptide of AC1 (Figure 3A of the ). Mutation at EF3 did not have a effect as dramatic as that at EF2
or EF4; nevertheless, this CaM mutant decreased the apparent affinity
of CaM for AC1 by 5-fold. Stopped-flow
kinetic data showed that the peptide-bound EF-hand in the N-lobe and
the peptide-free EF-hand in the C-lobe of CaM released Ca2+ simultaneously (Figure B). A previous study
showed that EF2 and EF3 make contact with a helix within the backbone
of CaM, which could contribute to the cooperative binding of Ca2+ between the two lobes. Hence,
EF2 and EF3 may communicate when interacting with AC1. The 5-fold
decrease in the affinity by a mutation at EF3 may result from a disrupted
communication; the binding of EF2 to CaMBD of AC1 may involve EF3.

AC1 displayed a slower activation by Ca2+ compared to
that of AC8. We interpret these slower
kinetics to reflect the slower interaction with CaM because of the
involvement of both lobes and/or a conformational change, such as
an isomerization, that stabilizes the complex as demonstrated by CaMKII., A recent study showed that the Ca2+ occupancy at EF1,
EF3, and EF4 led to the full activation of CaMKII, while EF3 was the
key for stabilizing ATP binding. The
activation mechanism of CaMKII is very complex, and possibly unique.
However, the CaM activation mechanism of AC1 may not be too dissimilar,
as AC1 needs three EF-hands occupied with Ca2+. Because
the CaMBD of AC1 is located very close to its catalytic core, ATP
may also be involved in the stabilization of the complex, although
more kinetic studies are required to determine this.

In response
to Ca2+ oscillations, AC1 produced a steady
cAMP increase, unlike AC8, which produced cAMP oscillations. We are inclined to speculate that this activation
behavior might reflect the tight interaction between CaM and CaMBD
of AC1 and/or the slower rate of Ca2+ association and dissociation,
which could not respond to high-frequency Ca2+ transients.
Of course, we must acknowledge that the time scales of these two processes,
Ca2+-CaM binding and AC activation (not to mention the
time scale of the two measurements, stopped-flow vs AC activity),
render this speculation fanciful. Nevertheless, the differences in
the ability of AC1 and AC8 to respond or not to Ca2+ transients
must bear some relationship to the Ca2+-CaM binding events.
Two isoforms of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA), 4a
and 4b, also exhibit different activation kinetics; PMCA4a is more
efficient in handling transient Ca2+ spikes than PMCA4b. This is because PMCA4b, which involves the isomerization
step, is activated and inactivated more
slowly by addition and removal of CaM, respectively, than PMCA4a, which does not involve the isomerization. AC1 and AC8 may have activation kinetics similar
to those of PMCA4b and PMCA4a, respectively. We propose that AC1 activation
is initiated by binding of Ca2+ to EF2–EF4, and
thus, the speed of activation is slow. These Ca2+ occupancies
led to a conformational change so that neither CaM nor Ca2+ dissociates from the complex easily. The relief of autoinhibition
then takes place to produce a nonoscillatory cAMP increase. Because
of the strong interaction, [Ca2+]i needs to
decrease considerably for CaM to dissociate to allow the inactivation
of AC1.

AC8 possesses two CaMBDs, one at each end of the molecule. The findings in this study support an earlier
proposal in which the N-terminal CaMBD of AC8 preassociates with C-lobe-liganded
CaM, which can be passed onto, or shared with, the C-terminal CaMBD
upon binding Ca2+ at the N-lobe to activate AC8 by removing
the autoinhibitory domain. A recent study
demonstrated that the two CaMBDs of AC8 could interact but only in
the absence of Ca2+-CaM, and this interaction was specifically
inhibited by Ca2+-saturated CaM, but not Ca2+-free CaM. A series of mutagenesis studies
revealed that the stimulation by Ca2+-CaM of C-terminal
CaMBD mutants of AC8 was only diminished when the N-terminal CaMBD
was truncated or mutated so that it could no longer bind CaM. The binding at the N-terminus is apparently
so tight that even though the independent ability of the C-terminus
to bind CaM can be severely compromised, only when CaM is not available
at the N-terminus can the consequences of C-terminal mutations be
revealed. On this basis, it is proposed
that the two CaMBDs associate at rest, with the C-lobe-saturated CaM
binding to the N-terminal CaMBD. With increases in [Ca2+]i, the N-lobe of CaM binds Ca2+ and subsequently
interacts with the C-terminal CaMBD of AC8, accompanied by a release
of the N-terminal CaMBD from the complex. Because of the weak interaction between the two CaMBDs in the presence
of Ca2+-saturated CaM, the translocation of CaM to the
C-terminal CaMBD and the dissociation of the N-terminal CaMBD occur
very rapidly. We assumed that this translocation takes place because
of the higher affinity of the C-terminal CaMBD for CaM compared to
that of the N-terminal CaMBD. The ESI-MS, however, clearly showed
that the N-terminal CaMBD has a higher affinity for fully liganded
CaM than the C-terminal CaMBD (Figure F,H).
Therefore, a conformational change or dissociation of Ca2+ from the C-lobe of CaM needs to occur to decrease the affinity of
the N-terminal CaMBD for CaM, so that CaM is released from the N-
to C-terminal CaMBD. Recently, Black and Persechini showed that precisely
where the N-lobe of CaM associates with IQ motifs and IQlm depends on the Ca2+ occupancy within the C-lobe of CaM. Although the C-lobe of CaM has a high affinity
for Ca2+, Ca2+ may dissociate from the C-lobe
transiently during a Ca2+ oscillation, when CaM associates
with the C-terminal CaMBD of AC8 only. This may cause the switching
of the interaction site of the N-lobe of CaM from upstream to downstream
of the IQlm in the C2b domain of AC8, resulting in
transient inactivation of AC8. This assumption is appealing as a reason
for Ca2+-induced cAMP oscillations observed in AC8 notwithstanding the reservations raised above
about the time scales of binding versus activation.

Although
further studies such as equilibrium binding will help
to establish the detailed CaM activation mechanisms of AC1 and AC8,
this study reveals the essential EF-hands of CaM that interact with
and regulate these two enzymes. This coupled with the relative affinity
of their CaMBDs for CaM suggested how these two enzymes decode Ca2+ signals into cAMP signals. Note, however, that the properties
of the CaMBDs inferred from these studies could be influenced within
the context of the tertiary environment of the full-length AC molecules
from which they are derived. Like many CaM-target proteins, AC1 and
AC8 are involved in synaptic plasticity. Until recently, they were
considered to have similar physiological roles, because of their high
levels of expression in the brain and overlapping functions, because
long-lasting long-term potentiation and fear-associated memory formation
were impaired in double-knockout but not single-knockout mice of AC1
or AC8, implying that one of the ACs
can compensate for the other. However, discrete neuronal functions
are now becoming apparent for the two isoforms. The distinct activation mechanisms of AC1 and AC8 by CaM
revealed here, which could decode Ca2+ signaling into different
cAMP dynamics, would be expected to result in or contribute to different
physiological possibilities for these enzymes. The different properties
of AC1 and AC8 revealed here emanating from their differing dependencies
on the two lobes of CaM illustrate the economical use that nature
makes of simple motifs to yield distinct arrays of physiological outcomes.

Transmembrane ACs consist of a cytosolic
N-terminus followed by a six-transmembrane-spanning cassette (Tm1)
and a large intracellular domain (C1a and -b). This arrangement is
repeated in the second portion of the molecule, with a second six-transmembrane-spanning
cassette (Tm2) followed by a large C-terminus (C2a and -b). The C1a
and C2a regions are the most conserved domains between ACs and combine
to form the catalytic core. The other
regions of AC are less conserved between isoforms and are involved
in subtype-specific regulation.
