Cystic fibrosis
(CF) is a recessive
genetic disorder prevalent among Caucasians arising from certain mutations
in the chloride channel, CF transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR)
protein. CFTR regulates transepithelial
chloride and bicarbonate levels across various secretory epithelia,
and it is thought that CFTR function is indispensable for many aspects
of fluid regulation. Over 1900 disease-causing
CF mutations have been identified, and it has been estimated that
approximately 70% of CF chromosomes worldwide contain at least one
copy of the mutational deletion of phenylalanine at residue 508 (ΔF508)
in the CFTR protein, which is categorized as a Class II defect− (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr). The ΔF508
mutation results in misfolding of the protein, causing CFTR to be
trapped and degraded by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated
degradation (ERAD) pathway. A small population
of ΔF508 CFTR rescued to the plasma membrane is only partially
functional compared to wild-type (WT) CFTR. Mislocalization and insufficient function of ΔF508 CFTR protein
at the plasma membrane leads to a generalized loss of hydration on
extracellular surfaces and defective mucocilliary clearance on the
lung surface, and the subsequent complications in the lung function
can lead to mortality. There are many
challenges to achieving highly efficient CF phenotypic correction.
Even after rescue to the plasma membrane, ΔF508 CFTR has persistent
gating defects manifested as reduced open probability (Po). The current
understanding of how loss-of-function CFTR mutations progressively
lead to severe CF pathologies, especially in the lung, is incomplete. Due to the heterogeneity of disease severity
among individuals with CF, there is a need to develop increasingly
efficient and eventually personalized CF correction. In addition to
establishing improvement of defective CFTR expression and function
by small-molecule CFTR modulators, it is critical to establish a clinical
correlation. The efficiency of CF correction can be clinically manifested
as the change in sweat chloride levels (&lt;40 mM/L in normal individuals
vs &gt;60 mM/L in symptomatic CF patients) and significant improvement
in the lung function (as measured by FEV1) of CF patients.

Based on the fact that rescued ΔF508 CFTR can function as
a chloride channel once it reaches the cell surface, many pharmacological
agents termed CFTR-correctors have been designed to increase cell-surface
levels of ΔF508 CFTR.,, Also, CFTR potentiators ameliorate the regulation defects associated
with many other CFTR mutations. The CFTR-corrector
VX-809 can achieve 15% of WT CFTR function and protein levels in primary
human bronchial epithelial (HBE) airway cells isolated from patients
homozygous for the ΔF508 CFTR mutation. VX-809 exhibited high potency and selectivity for CFTR correction
compared to the previous correctors. The CFTR-potentiator VX-770 stimulates
passage of chloride ions from the G551D CFTR mutant which exhibits
defective gating. VX-809 treatment alone was shown to be less effective
in improving lung function in CF patients, although sweat chloride
concentration was reduced (CF patients have salty sweat). The combination of VX-809 and VX-770 in recent
Phase III clinical trials achieved improvement of 10 percentage points
or more in the lung function of CF patients (http://investors.vrtx.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=677520).

Low-temperature incubation (24–30 °C) of ΔF508
CFTR facilitates its retrieval from the ER and localization to the
plasma membrane. However, the rescued ΔF508 CFTR is conformationally
destabilized at physiological temperature and undergoes accelerated
ubiquitination, endocytosis, and lysosomal degradation.− Consequently, rescued ΔF508 CFTR has a very short life (&lt;4
h) compared to WT CFTR (18–24 h). Macromolecular complex formations of CFTR regulate the function
and stability of the protein at the plasma membrane.− Association of CFTR with the scaffolding PSD-95/Dlg-5/ZO-1 (PDZ)
protein, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor
1 (NHERF1), stabilizes CFTR by coupling it to the actin cytoskeleton
and regulates CFTR function by governing the phosphorylation status
of the protein.,,, Recent studies have shown that NHERF1 overexpression
reduces surface ΔF508 CFTR internalization and can bring ΔF508
CFTR to the level of WT CFTR, correlating with the modulation of CFTR-NHERF1-ezrin-actin
protein–protein interactions. Thus,
parameters affecting trafficking, stability, and the regulation of
surface CFTR would determine the functional output of CFTR. In the
current study, we explored the contribution of macromolecular formations
of CFTR in extending the surface retention of ΔF508 CFTR after
conformational stabilization in the presence of VX-809. We demonstrate
that the otherwise weak interaction of ΔF508 CFTR with NHERF1
is improved in the presence of VX-809, which would reduce CFTR-protein
turnover and enhance the stability and functional efficiency of the
protein at the plasma membrane. Macromolecular formations of CFTR
could be critical to enhance the efficiency of correction of mutant
CFTR and may prove beneficial in designing CFTR modulators with greater
efficacy to target CF.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
VX-809
was purchased from Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX). All VX-809 incubations were carried out at 5 μM
concentration for 48 h, unless otherwise indicated.

Cell Cultures
HEK 293 and CFBEo– cells
were cultured in DMEM-F12 and MEM media, respectively (Invitrogen;
Carlsbad, CA), containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Cultures were maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.
Temperature rescue of ΔF508 CFTR protein was carried out at
28 °C for 24–48 h.

Mice
Cftr (+/+), Cftr (+/ΔF508), and Cftr (ΔF508/ ΔF508) C57BL/6 mice littermates
were used for isolating enterospheres. All mice were maintained on
colyte water and regular mouse chow.

In Vitro Organoid Culture
and Fluid-Secretion Measurement in
Enterospheres
The organoid-culture protocol− has been standardized in our laboratory by Moon et al. (unpublished
data) for monitoring CFTR-mediated fluid secretion. Briefly, the small
intestines were removed from 8-week-old male mice and rinsed with
cold PBS. Villi were discarded by scraping with a cover slide and
the tissues were minced, followed by incubation with 2 mM EDTA in
1X PBS at 4 °C for 30 min, and subsequently passed through a
70 μm cell strainer. The crypts were collected by centrifugation
at 1200 rpm for 5 min and cultured on Matrigel (BD; San Jose, CA)
with organoid media (Advanced DMEM/F12 with glutamax, penicillin,
streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, B27, N2, 1 mM NAC, 100 ng/mL Noggin, 1
μg/mL R-spondin-1, and 50 ng/mL EGF) and incubated in a humidified
10% CO2 chamber at 37 °C. The Matrigel-embedded enterospheres
were pretreated with DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM) at 37 °C for
48 h and placed in prewarmed HBSS in glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek;
Ashland, MA). CFTR-agonists forskolin (Fsk) (10 μM) and IBMX
(100 μM) were added to the enterospheres at 37 °C for 30
min, and phase-contrast images were taken using an IX-51 microscope
(Olympus; Tokyo, Japan) both before and 30 min after the addition
of the CFTR agonists. The radii of the whole enterospehere and luminal
sphere before and after stimulation were calculated using ImageJ software
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). The volume of the luminal
sphere was normalized with the volume of the entire enterosphere to
calculate fluid secretion. In some experiments, the highly selective
CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh172 (50 μM), was added to
the organoids to verify that the secretions were CFTR-mediated.

Proximity Ligation Assay
Matrigel-embedded mice enterospheres
were used for performing the proximity ligation assay (PLA) (Olink
Bioscience; Uppsala, Sweden). Briefly, enterospheres [pretreated with
DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM) at 37 °C for 48 h] were incubated
with rabbit 1314 CFTR polyclonal antibody (1:50) and mouse NHERF1
monoclonal antibody (1:50) (BD Biosciences) at 4 °C for overnight.
The PLA was performed with anti-rabbit (plus) and anti-mouse (minus)
Duolink In Situ PLA probes on the organoids following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The images were taken using a Zeiss LSM-5 Pascal confocal
microscope, and the PLA signals that represent the site of the protein–protein
interaction appear in red.

Iodide Efflux Assay
CFTR-mediated
halide efflux was
measured using an iodide efflux assay. HEK 293 cells stably expressing
either WT CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR were grown in 60 mm dishes and
incubated with DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM) with or without temperature
rescue for 48 h. Briefly, cells were loaded for 60 min at room temperature
with loading buffer (136 mM NaI prepared in buffer: 137 mM NaCl, 4.5
mM KH2PO4, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2). Extracellular NaI was washed
away thoroughly (5–7 times) with efflux buffer (loading buffer
with 136 mM NaNO3 replacing the NaI). Cells were equilibrated
for 1 min each, and aliquots were collected four times to establish
a stable baseline in the efflux buffer alone. After establishing basal
equilibrium with the nitrate buffer, cells were treated with CFTR
agonists (Fsk and IBMX) prepared in the nitrate buffer and aliquots
were collected six times at 1 min intervals. The iodide concentration
of each aliquot collected was determined using an iodide-selective
electrode (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and converted to iodide
efflux rate (nanomol/min) as described previously.

Short-Circuit Current (Isc) Measurements
(Ussing Chamber Experiments)
Polarized CFBEo– cell monolayers were grown on Costar Transwell permeable supports
(Cambridge, MA; filter diameter 6.5 mm) until the monolayers reached
confluency, and the transwells were mounted in an Ussing chamber maintained
at 37 °C. Isc was measured as described
previously. CFBEo– cells
pretreated with DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM for 48 h; both apical and
basolateral sides) were bathed in Ringer’s solution (mM) (Basolateral
side: 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.36 K2HPO4, 0.44 KH2PO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 4.2 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.2, [Cl–] = 149) and
low Cl– Ringer’s solution (mM) (Apical side:
133.3 Na-gluconate, 2.5 NaCl, 0.36 K2HPO4, 0.44 KH2PO4, 5.7 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 4.2 NaHCO3, 10 HEPES, 10 mannitol, pH 7.2, [Cl–] =
14.8) with VX-809 (5 μM) in the bath solutions at 37 °C
and saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. A 2 mV
pulse was applied every 1 min throughout the experiment to check for
the integrity of the epithelia. After stabilization of basal Isc, cells were treated with Fsk and IBMX on
the apical side. CFTRinh172 (20–50 μM) was
added to the apical side at the end of the experiment to verify that
the Isc were CFTR-dependent.

Pull-Down Assay
Parental and Flag-WT CFTR-, Flag-ΔF508
CFTR-expressing HEK 293 cells were maintained in 60 or 100 mm dishes
at 37 °C until confluent.

For some experiments, Flag-WT
CFTR and Flag-ΔF508 CFTR were immunopurified from HEK 293 cells
that were grown in 100 mm dishes at 28 or 37 °C in the presence
of DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM) for 48 h. Cells were lysed in 12 mL
lysis buffer (PBS 0.2% Triton X-100 + protease inhibitors ±5
μM VX-809). Cell lysates were mixed for 30 min, followed by
centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Flag-beads (400
μL of 10% slurry) were then added and mixed overnight. The mixtures
were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 2 min, the beads were washed three
times with lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted with glycine
buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (pH 2.2), followed by immediate
neutralization with 1.5 M Tris-Cl pH 8.8.

A competition-based
strategy was adopted to determine the specific
effects of VX-809 on CFTR-NHERF1 binding. HEK 293 cells expressing
Flag-ΔF508 CFTR were grown at 37 °C in the presence of
DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM) for 24 h and lysed in PBS + 0.2% Triton
X-100. The binding of ΔF508 CFTR with NHERF1 was serially disrupted
in the presence of GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 (0, 2.5, 5, and 10 μg) for
2 h. CFTR protein complexes were immunoprecipitated overnight with
Flag-beads (15 μL of 10% slurry) at 4 °C and then eluted
with sample buffer. All of the samples were appropriately immunoblotted
with mouse R1104 CFTR and NHERF1 (BD Biosciences) monoclonal antibodies.
The levels of NHERF1 relative to CFTR protein were quantified using
ImageJ software.

Surface-Labeling Assay
HEK 293 cells
expressing Flag-WT
CFTR, ΔF508 CFTR, and ΔF508 CFTR His 10 were grown on
35 mm dishes in the presence or absence of VX-809 (5 μM) at
37 °C for 48 h, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, blocked
with 1% BSA for 90 min, and treated with α-Flag HRP (0.2 μg/mL)
for 90 min. The HRP substrate, 1-Step Ultra TMB (Pierce; Waltham,
MA), was then added to the dishes and observed for color development
(usually 10–15 min). The reaction was stopped by adding an
equal amount of 2 N H2SO4. Absorbance was read
at 450 nm.

The Hanrahan laboratory was the first to generate
cells (BHK) expressing WT CFTR His10. We used a similar strategy to clone both WT and ΔF508 into
the pLenti-Puro vector. We have used the WT CFTR His 10 in our previous
studies (in collaboration with Hanrahan laboratory) and found that although it traffics to the plasma membrane
(not as efficiently as WT), the His10 tag on the C-terminus of CFTR
disrupts the binding of PDZ proteins (i.e., EBP50/NHERF1 interaction
was perturbed), and therefore the macromolecular complexes between
CFTR and its PDZ partners are perturbed. The first published description
of His10-tagged F508del on the C-terminus (ΔF508 CFTR His10)
is from Bear laboratory wherein they
purified the protein from insect cells (Sf-9 cells).

AlphaScreen
Assay for CFTR-NHERF1-PDZ2 Interactions
We used the AlphaScreen
(amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous
assay) GST Detection Kit (PerkinElmer; Waltham, MA) to study interactions
of purified full-length Flag-WT CFTR and Flag-ΔF508 CFTR with
the GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 domain. All proteins used were of high quality
and purified under nondenaturing conditions (we tested protein interactions
with syntaxin 1A at the N-terminus and protein binding to Azido ATP;
data not shown). In brief, starting with a 100 nM concentration, CFTR
protein (WT and ΔF508) was serially diluted (in 1/2 log dilution
series) in the assay buffer (1x HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20 [v/v],
pH 7.2) containing GST-NHERF1-PDZ-2 (100 nM final concentration) and
biotin-CFTR-C-tail peptide (100 nM final concentration). The resulting
solutions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. In triplicate,
each sample solution (15 μL) was transferred to a white opaque
384-well microplate (OptiPlate-384; PerkinElmer) into which anti-GST
acceptor beads (5 μL; 20 μg/mL final concentration) were
added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Streptavidin donor
beads (5 μL; 20 μg/mL final concentration) were then added
and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The plate was read on a
FLUOstar-Omega plate reader (Ortenberg, Germany).

Single-Particle
Tracking
Single-particle tracking (SPT)
on HEK 293 cells was performed as described previously. HEK 293 cells stably expressing Flag-WT CFTR,
Flag-ΔF508 CFTR and Flag-ΔF508 CFTR His 10 were grown
on 35 mm glass-bottom dishes (MatTek). Cells were washed twice with
HBSS and blocked with HBSS containing 4% BSA for 15 min. Cells were
then incubated at 37 °C with biotin α-Flag antibody (1
μg/mL, Sigma) for 30 min, washed five times followed by an incubation
with streptavidin-conjugated Qdot-655 (0.1 nM, Invitrogen) for 2 min,
washed extensively eight times, and immediately mounted on an Olympus
inverted microscope (IX51). The images were captured with a Hamamatsu
EM-CCD camera at 1–3 frames per second for 1–3 min (50
ms exposure time, 100× oil-immersion objective (NA 1.40), xenon
(300-W lamp) light source) controlled by SlideBook 4.2 software. SPT
was performed using the particle-tracking module of SlideBook 4.2
software, which generates trajectories and calculates the mean squared
displacement. Five to ten cells per dish were used for plotting histograms
of the diffusion coefficients.

Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as mean

Results and Discussion
There has been dedicated research
to evolve therapies for CF, including
newly generated CFTR-correctors such as VX-809. VX-809 has been demonstrated
to partially overcome the processing defects of ΔF508 CFTR,
enabling more CFTR molecules to reach the plasma membrane. VX-809 has been advanced into clinical studies,
both alone and in combination with VX-770, to evaluate efficacy in
patients with CF who are homozygous for the ΔF508 mutation.
However, VX-809 alone has shown only modest efficacy and failed to
improve lung functions in CF patients. Therefore, insights into the potential of VX-809 will help improve
the efficacy of the drug in targeting CF.

ΔF508 CFTR is
a temperature-sensitive mutant that can be
rescued to the plasma membrane at low temperature (24–30 °C)
and when transferred to 37 °C, in view of the high instability
of the mutant protein at the cell surface, ΔF508 CFTR becomes
internalized and subsequently degraded. It is well documented that the PDZ motif of CFTR is essential in
prolonging the stability of CFTR at the plasma membrane. Haggie et
al. reported that deletion of the PDZ motif results in increased lateral
mobility and decreased stability of CFTR at the plasma membrane, as
it disrupts the coupling of CFTR to the actin cytoskeleton via NHERF1
and ezrin. Also, ΔF508 CFTR molecules
are less stable compared to WT CFTR at the plasma membrane. In view of these observations, we hypothesized
that the instability of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane is
due to its weak association with NHERF1. Flag-WT CFTR and Flag-ΔF508
CFTR proteins were purified, and the integrity of the purified proteins
was confirmed on Coomassie-stained gels (Figure A). We used the AlphaScreen competition assay to determine the IC50 of Flag-ΔF508 CFTR and Flag-WT CFTR that competitively
inhibit the interaction between the PDZ2 domain of NHERF1(NHERF1-PDZ2)
and a biotinylated CFTR peptide (containing the last 10 amino acids
at the C-terminus of CFTR). NHERF1 has two PDZ domains, and CFTR can
bind to both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains. The
AlphaScreen data indicated a weaker-affinity binding between NHERF1-PDZ2
and ΔF508 CFTR compared to WT CFTR, with the respective IC50 of 442 and 89.3 nM, equivalent to ∼5-fold lower affinity
of ΔF508 CFTR for NHERF1 (Figure B).
To further support this observation, Flag-WT CFTR and Flag-ΔF508
CFTR proteins were immunoprecipitated from the HEK 293 cells overexpressing
these proteins using Flag beads (±temperature rescue at 28 °C).
The immunoprecipitated proteins were later immunoblotted and probed
for interaction with NHERF1. ΔF508 CFTR purified from the cells
maintained at 37 or 28 °C exhibited much weaker binding to NHERF1
(almost undetectable for 37 °C) than WT CFTR (Figure A and B; left, and the bindings were quantified
in the right panel). These data strongly support our hypothesis that
ΔF508 CFTR exhibits weaker binding affinity toward NHERF1 that
may render surface CFTR unstable at physiologic temperature.

ΔF508
CFTR interacts poorly with NHERF1. (A) Coomassie-stained
gel showing purified Flag-WT CFTR (left) and Flag-ΔF508 CFTR
(right) at 37 °C. El#1–2 refer to the number of eluted
fractions of the purified proteins. (B) Protein-binding curve derived
from the Alpha Screen competition assay to measure the affinity of
GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 for Flag-WT CFTR (left panel) and Flag-ΔF508
CFTR (right panel) purified from HEK 293 cells overexpressing these
proteins and maintained at 37 °C.

VX-809 potentiates the weaker interaction of ΔF508 CFTR with
NHERF1. (A) and (B) Western blot data depicting the relative binding
of Flag-WT CFTR (37 °C) and Flag-ΔF508 CFTR (37 or 28 °C)
immunopurified proteins with NHERF1. The amounts of CFTR protein purified
using Flag-beads are indicated. Flag-ΔF508 CFTR shows extremely
weak binding with NHERF1 compared to WT-CFTR at 37 °C, as well
as at 28 °C. (C) Western blots to demonstrate that VX-809 potentiates
the interaction of Flag-ΔF508 CFTR with NHERF1. Bar graphs on
the right side of each immunoblot represent the quantitation of NHERF1-CFTR
interaction. Input refers to the cell lysates used prior to immunoprecipitation.
(D) A competitive assay, in which GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 competes against
endogenous NHERF1 to bind to Flag-ΔF508 CFTR in the presence
or absence of VX-809, demonstrates that VX-809 improves CFTR-NHERF1
interaction affinity.

Based on these observations, we reasoned that the functional
efficiency
of ΔF508 CFTR can be significantly manipulated by increasing
the stability of the rescued mutant protein at the plasma membrane
and questioned whether ΔF508 CFTR correction by VX-809 would
involve potentiating the otherwise weak interaction of ΔF508
CFTR with NHERF1, leading to prolonged retention of the mutant protein
at the plasma membrane. To demonstrate this, Flag-ΔF508 CFTR
was pretreated with either DMSO as a control or VX-809 at 37 °C
for 48 h, and the proteins were purified and normalized. Upon immunoblotting,
and probing the immunopurified proteins with NHERF1 antibody, we observed
higher amounts of NHERF1 associated with Flag-ΔF508 CFTR in
the presence of VX-809 compared to control (Figure C). Note that VX-809 always was included in the buffers during
the immunoprecipitation procedures. To specifically determine that
VX-809 facilitates increased binding of ΔF508 CFTR with NHERF1,
we utilized a competition-based assay. The binding of Flag-ΔF508
CFTR with NHERF1 was serially disrupted in the presence of GST-NHERF1-PDZ2
(Figure D). Upon incubation with VX-809 for
24 h, 50% of ΔF508 CFTR-NHERF1 binding was disrupted at a lower
dilution of GST-NHERF1-PDZ2 protein (∼2 μg for DMSO vs
∼4 μg for VX-809 treated) compared to DMSO alone (Figure D).

We next tested whether VX-809 can enhance
the functional retention
of temperature-rescued ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane. We
performed Isc measurements in CFBEo– cells stably expressing ΔF508 CFTR and ΔF508
CFTR His 10 (note: the His 10 tag on the C-terminus of CFTR disrupts
binding to PDZ proteins) and temperature-rescued at 28 °C in
the presence of either DMSO as a control or VX-809 (5 μM) for
48 h. The cells were mounted in the Ussing chamber and maintained
at 37 °C to monitor the functional outcomes on Isc of depleting surface levels of ΔF508 CFTR and
ΔF508 CFTR His 10 molecules over a period of time in the presence
or absence of VX-809. CFTR function was stimulated with cAMP-elevating
agents Fsk (10 μM) and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX
(100 μM) added to the apical side of the cells. At the end of
4 h Isc measurement, ΔF508 CFTR
retained approximately 72% of the function of that at 0 h in the presence
of VX-809 compared to approximately 45% with DMSO alone in a statistically
significant manner. However, the phenotype of CFTR function was not
statistically significant for ΔF508 CFTR His 10 when comparing
DMSO and VX-809 treatment (). The data suggest that VX-809 enhances the stability
and function of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane by involving
certain PDZ-mediated interactions.

Several studies have demonstrated
that compounds capable of modulating
CFTR activity partially correct multiple structural defects in CFTR
that are caused by the ΔF508 mutation.− Other CF correctors
(VRT-325 and Corr4a) facilitate ΔF508 CFTR maturation by restoring
the otherwise poor interaction between the two halves of the molecule. Also, VX-770 (a CFTR potentiator) can partially
restore the functional defect(s) associated with nucleotide-binding
domain 1 (NBD1), which contains the mutation in ΔF508 CFTR,
so that the channel can function more efficiently. In contrast to these findings, we demonstrated that CF
correctors stabilize ΔF508 CFTR molecules at the plasma membrane
via a mechanism involving protein–protein interaction. However,
it cannot be ruled out that the structural defect in NBD1 of ΔF508
CFTR would confer compromised capacity of the protein to be involved
in protein–protein interactions and that VX-809 acts to partially
overcome this structural limitation.

We also tested the effects
of VX-809 in our culture model system.
HEK 293 cells stably expressing Flag-ΔF508 CFTR and Flag-ΔF508
CFTR His 10 were maintained at 28 °C for 48 h in the presence
of DMSO or VX-809 (5 μM), and the surface levels of CFTR were
measured using an HRP-based surface-labeling method. We found that
there were fewer (approximately 2-fold less) Flag-ΔF508 CFTR
His 10 molecules than Flag-ΔF508 CFTR molecules at the plasma
membrane (). VX-809 increased the surface levels of temperature-rescued Flag-ΔF508
CFTR and Flag-ΔF508 CFTR His 10 molecules by 1.3- and 2-fold,
respectively, compared to the DMSO-treated cells (). Iodide efflux measurements
were performed in HEK 293 cells that overexpressed ΔF508 CFTR,
and VX-809 pretreatment potentiated the response of ΔF508 CFTR
and temperature-rescued ΔF508 CFTR by 3- and 2-fold, respectively,
in the presence of the CFTR agonists-Fsk and IBMX (). VX-809 also potentiated
ΔF508 CFTR function in CFBEo– cells. Polarized
ΔF508 CFTR CFBEo– cells were either maintained
at 37 °C or temperature-rescued in the presence or absence of
VX-809, and CFTR-dependent Isc were subsequently
monitored in the Ussing chamber in response to Fsk and IBMX (). VX-809-pretreated
cells responded 10- and 3-fold higher, respectively, to the agonists
compared to controls, corresponding to ΔF508 CFTR and temperature-rescued
ΔF508 CFTR function ().

Our laboratory and others have demonstrated
the feasibility of
using intestinal organoids derived from crypt intestinal stem cells
(also referred to as organospheres) as a model for studying CFTR-dependent
fluid secretion., Intestinal organoids demonstrate
luminal expansion in response to CFTR-activating agents Fsk and IBMX
resulting from augmented fluid secretion, and the expansion is inhibited
in the presence of a CFTR-specific inhibitor (CFTRinh172) () .
Crypts were isolated from the small intestines of Cftr (+/+), Cftr (+/ΔF508), and Cftr (ΔF508/ΔF508) male mice and cultured to form intestinal organoids
as described in detail in the  section. Cftr (ΔF508/ ΔF508) organoids
were treated with VX-809 (5 μM) at 37 °C for 24 h. Fsk-stimulated
luminal secretion rates were comparable between Cftr (+/+) and Cftr (+/ΔF508) intestinal organoids. VX-809 significantly improved
the secretion rate in organoids from Cftr (ΔF508/ΔF508) mice by 2.5-fold compared to the DMSO-treated
controls upon Fsk treatment (Figure A and
B). The Fsk-induced fluid secretion was CFTR dependent, as Fsk failed
to elicit significant secretion in the presence of CFTRinh172 (). The

The potentiating effect of VX-809 on ΔF508
CFTR-NHERF1 interactions
was demonstrated in vivo in ΔF508 CFTR and WT CFTR organoids
using the PLA. The interaction between two proteins results in PLA
signals (in red), if the interacting proteins are within 40 Å
of each other. We found strong PLA signals in VX-809-treated Cftr (ΔF508/ΔF508) organoids
(5 μM VX-809 for 24 h) and very weak signals in the untreated
organoids (Figure C, lower panel). WT CFTR
organoids were used for positive (pos) and negative (neg) assay conditions
(Figure C, upper panel). Therefore, the VX-809-mediated
correction of ΔF508 CFTR that we observed was not merely due
to localization of more ΔF508 CFTR protein to the plasma membrane,
but also attributable to the stabilization of the protein at the plasma
membrane via potentiation of interactions with NHERF1.

VX-809 restricts the
mobility of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma
membrane in a PDZ-interaction-based mechanism. (A) Representative

CFTR His 10 were temperature rescued in the presence or absence of
VX-809 for 48 h at 28 °C. (B) Representative mean square displacement

Potentiation of protein–protein
interactions in the presence
of an agent can be indirectly tested by monitoring the reduced mobility
of a protein at the plasma membrane using SPT, which allows monitoring
of the diffusive behavior of cell-surface proteins with nanometer
spatial and millisecond temporal resolution., Previous studies demonstrated that deletion of the PDZ motif increased
lateral mobility of WT CFTR by approximately 50% and that the increase
in mobility was a consequence of compromised CFTR-ezrin interaction
mediated via NHERF1., Since we had established that
ΔF508 CFTR interacts poorly with NHERF1 and that VX-809 enhances
the association of ΔF508 CFTR with NHERF1, we proceeded to test
whether ΔF508 CFTR exhibits decreased mobility at the plasma
membrane in the presence of VX-809. Diffusiveness of a protein can
be measured in terms of change in the diffusion constant determined
using SPT. HEK 293 cells expressing Flag-ΔF508 CFTR and Flag-ΔF508
CFTR His 10 were temperature-rescued in the presence of DMSO or VX-809
and labeled with biotin α-Flag antibody followed by streptavidin-conjugated
quantum dot-655 for monitoring CFTR lateral mobility on the plasma
membrane (Figure A). In accordance with the
surface-labeling data, there were fewer ΔF508 CFTR His 10 molecules
than ΔF508 CFTR molecules at the plasma membrane. HEK 293 cells
expressing no CFTR (parental cells) or WT CFTR were used as negative
and positive controls, respectively. Consistent with previous reports,
ΔF508 CFTR exhibited higher mobility compared to WT CFTR, with
mean diffusion coefficients of 0.0139 vs 0.00417 μm2/s (Figures B–D and A and B). The mean diffusion coefficient of ΔF508 CFTR
molecules that were subjected to VX-809 decreased substantially, by
41% (0.00819 vs 0.0139 μm2/s), as also indicated
by the more confined trajectories of ΔF508 CFTR molecules treated
with VX-809 (Figures B, D, E and B). As expected, ΔF508 CFTR His 10 exhibited
higher diffusiveness compared to ΔF508 CFTR (Figures B, F, G and C). The trajectories of ΔF508 CFTR represented
in histogram form trended toward lower diffusion coefficients in VX-809-treated
cells compared to DMSO-treated cells, and the effect was mitigated
in ΔF508 CFTR His 10 (20%; 0.035 vs 0.028 μm2/s; Figures B, D–G and B and C). These results clearly indicate that VX-809 restricts
the movement of ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane involving
a PDZ interaction that also would plausibly decrease protein internalization.

of individual CFTR molecules (right panel of each figure).

New aspects of ΔF508 CFTR conformational
instability that
have been elucidated are the impaired interactions of NBDs of CFTR
with membrane-spanning domains (MSD). A
recent study describes the action of VX-809 on the stabilization of
the NBD1 (contains the ΔF508 mutation)–MSD1 interface. It has been proposed that VX-809 mediates this
conformational stabilization by binding to CFTR inside the ER, leading
to two major outcomes. First, ΔF508 CFTR subjected to VX-809
would exhibit improved folding inside the ER that impedes the degradative
process and rescues more ΔF508 CFTR molecules to the cell surface.
This resonates with the finding of increased resistance of ER-trapped
ΔF508 CFTR to degradation in the presence of VX-809. Second, a conformationally better stabilized
ΔF508 CFTR at the plasma membrane would exhibit improved interaction
with NHERF1, less mobility, and reduced susceptibility to ubiquitination
and endocytosis, and therefore, all these factors would cumulatively
lead to longer retention of the protein at the membrane. Rescued non-native
ΔF508 CFTR is under the surveillance of a peripheral quality
control system involving chaperones, co-chaperones, and ubiquitination
machinery., Therefore, it is very likely
that VX-809-rescued ΔF508 CFTR proceeds better in the peripheral
checkpoints compared to that with the vehicle treatment. We demonstrated
that VX-809 considerably reduces the median diffusion coefficient
of ΔF508 CFTR, but not significantly that of ΔF508 CFTR
His 10, which suggests that VX-809-restrained CFTR binds more strongly
with NHERF1 compared to the native molecule. This would further initiate
the regulatory effects of NHERF1 on the peripheral profile of ΔF508
CFTR, including phosphorylation-mediated regulation of the protein.
Initial studies indicated that CFTR-NHERF1 interaction is critical
for polarized expression of CFTR protein. However, subsequent studies of C-terminal deletions in CFTR including
removal of the PDZ-motif were shown not to affect the apical surface
expression of the protein; nonetheless, it has been argued that these
PDZ interactions are likely to affect the steady state levels of the
protein. NHERF1 overexpression was found
to decrease CFTR internalization that was accompanied by cytoskeletal
changes in the cell. Overall, NHERF1
has been shown to mediate regulation of the phosphorylated status
of the protein, surface expression, mobility, and henceforth durability
of the protein.,, Insights into the transitions of VX-809-bound ΔF508 CFTR globular
structure will conclusively determine the structural changes that
VX-809 brings about in ΔF508 CFTR that enhance its stability
at the plasma membrane.

Using VX-809 as a tool, we have evaluated
an important determinant
of rescued ΔF508 CFTR functional efficiency, and therefore,
new schemes for the generation of drugs should emphasize mechanisms
to strengthen peripheral protein–protein interactions of ΔF508
CFTR, which likely would make the drugs more effective. Development
of an improved and more selective CFTR corrector that transforms into
clinical studies would facilitate the development of potential new
therapies to treat the severe physiological outcomes associated with
the ΔF508 CFTR mutation.
