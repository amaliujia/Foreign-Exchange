BioArchitecture and Molecular Motors
As the scope of BioArchitecture has become better defined it is clear that there is a need to expand the expertise of our Editorial Board in the area of molecular motors. You will find over the next few months that there will be extensive recruitment onto the Editorial Board. There is a lack of suitable journals dedicated to studies of molecular motors and given their pivotal roles in establishing and navigating biological space and generating the biomechanical properties of cells and tissues we intend to promote BioArchitecture as a home for such research.

BioArchitecture and the Nucleus
Since its inception BioArchitecture has encouraged an inclusive view of architecture at all levels. It is increasingly clear that our appreciation of the architecture of the nucleus will undergo a revolution in the next five years as biochemical and microscopic approaches give us an understanding how natureâ€™s largest polymer is organized in time and space. The lack of landmark structures has made the nucleus an extraordinary challenge to understand in terms of the spatial organization of its array of functions. BioArchitecture has welcomed papers offering new insights into nuclear architecture since its inception and we see this as a growth area for the future.

BioArchitecture and the Review Process
We are dedicated to a rapid review process, within two weeks of submission, and a final decision with three weeks. I want to thank our Associate Editors for their identification of potential Editorial Board members and their timely advice. I am very grateful to our Editorial Board members for their commitment to a rapid and constructive review process. Finally, I want to thank the editorial staff at Landes Bioscience for their great support and particularly Kristen Prihoda and Elaine Ellerton.
