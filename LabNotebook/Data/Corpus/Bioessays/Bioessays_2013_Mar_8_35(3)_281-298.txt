Introduction
When human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were first isolated from blastocyst stage embryos in 1998 [], many researchers believed that within 10–15 years the technology would be sufficiently advanced to allow cell replacement of tissues damaged by injury, disease or aging. Within the next few years, approximately 1200 hESC lines had been derived (http://www.umassmed.edu/iscr/index.aspx) and it became possible to produce human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by reprogramming somatic cells with just four genetic factors [, ]. This provided a considerable resource of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that could be propagated during long-term culture and yet be differentiated to a variety of lineages representative of the three embryonic germ layers []. Clinically relevant cell types included cardiomyocytes and blood lineages (mesoderm), hepatocytes and pancreatic lineages (endoderm) and neural and dermal lineages (ectoderm).

An unexpected hurdle was that methods to culture and differentiate hPSCs were inefficient and labour-intensive []. Improvements in cell passaging and commercial provision of defined culture media (e.g. mTeSR [], Stem Cell Technologies; StemPro, Invitrogen []) reduced the labour required by individual labs. Nevertheless, even defined media are susceptible to considerable batch to batch variability, probably due to growth factor manufacture inconstancies or degradation of the growth factors during storage. Growth substrate is another source of variability. hPSCs are typically grown on biological substrates such as human or mouse feeder cells, extracted matrices (e.g. Matrigel) or recombinant proteins (e.g. laminin, collagen, fibronectin and vitronectin), all of which are expensive, variable and/or labile []. Although synthetic substrates that support pluripotency in defined culture media are an exciting development [, ], further refinement is needed. For example, hPSCs can be maintained on Corning® Synthemax™ substrates in mTeSR culture medium [] but a single 6-well plate costs $75 and passaging cells requires manual scraping, which is not amenable to scaled automation. For differentiation, it is now very encouraging that protocols exist to yield purities in excess of 50–70% for many cell types. However, the diversity of methods published for each differentiated cell lineage [] belies the challenge of successfully reproducing protocols between different hPSC lines and labs.

The use of hPSC-derivatives in cell replacement therapy faces challenges
In addition to the difficulties discussed above, cell transplantation also brings many other hurdles to the fore. These include regulatory and ethical issues, whether cells survive, engraft in the correct location and function after delivery, whether patients can be recruited successfully, and the costs associated with clinical trials. The first to transplant hESC derivatives into humans in 2009 [], Geron Corporation had to convince the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that their GRNOPC1 neural progenitor cell line was suitable for transplantation into patients with thoracic spinal cord injury with a 22,000 page document detailing the in vitro and preclinical characterisation that had been performed over many years. Although no adverse events were recorded after GRNOPC1 transplantation and the Regulators approved progression to a Phase II trial, spiralling costs led Geron to abandon their entire hESC programme in late 2011. Many researchers viewed this as a major setback for clinical translation of hPSC-based cell replacement therapies. However, Advanced Cell Technology (ACT) recently received FDA approval for clinical trials to treat macular degeneration with hESC-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells [] and these trials will be watched with interest. Nevertheless, it is sobering that after 14 years of research, there is only one active clinical trial using hPSC-derivatives (see clinicaltrials.gov). It is now becoming accepted that a faster route to realising the potential of hPSCs and their differentiated derivatives is through in vitro application, particularly in drug safety assessment and in providing novel models of genetic disease.

Human conditions are not always reflected in animal models because of species differences
Although in vitro disease modelling could theoretically be realised by harvesting primary cells from healthy donors or those carrying a relevant genetic condition, for many cell types this is not a realistic option. For example, harvesting heart tissue on an industrial scale is limited by suitable donors, lack of proliferation of cardiomyocytes, variability in preparation, disease state and cell viability. These problems are particularly pronounced if the cells are sourced from cadavers. Consequently, there is considerable reliance on material derived from animals. Mice are most commonly used for modelling disease because of the relative ease of precisely manipulating the genome by gene targeted homologous recombination []. However, there are major differences in the gene expression and physiology between animals and humans, from the single cell level up to the whole animal. The beat rate of the mouse heart is approximately ten times faster than the human (500 bpm vs. 60 bpm) but it has an electrocardiogram duration 5–10 times shorter (450 milliseconds vs. 50–100 milliseconds) []. Increases in heart rate are associated with increased force of contraction in humans but decreased force in mice []. Whereas repolarisation of the mouse cardiomyocytes is driven primarily by Ito, IK,slow1, IK,slow2, ISS ion channels, this function is provided by the potassium channels, IKr and IKr in human cells []. There are species differences in the role of the regulatory molecule, phospholamban [], and expression of structural genes also varies. In humans, expression of alpha and beta myosin heavy chains (α-/β-MHC) locates to the atria and ventricles, respectively [], but in the mouse αMHC is expressed in both locations []. The surface marker, SIRPA, is expressed on cardiomyocytes from human but not mouse hPSCs, and so only the human cells can be enriched by fluorescence or magnetic activated cell sorting [].

Such differences mean that extrapolation from mouse to human can be misleading. In humans, long QT syndrome (LQTS) type 1 and type 2 are caused by mutations that affect function of IKs and IKr, respectively, and can lead to palpitations, syncope (fainting), seizures and sudden cardiac death []. Since repolarisation of the mouse heart does not rely on these channels, this animal cannot be used to model the conditions. Outside the cardiovascular system, the survival motor neuron 2 gene (SMN2) gene is implicated in development of spinal muscular atrophy in humans, but this gene is not present in mice, flies and worms []. The gene sequence of α-synuclein found in healthy wildtype mice and rats can confer Parkinson's disease in humans []. The ontology of organs affected by cystic fibrosis in humans differs markedly from that in mice []. Such observations have prompted development of novel in vitro human-based systems for studying human genetic disease.

Development of hPSC-based models of human genetic disease is needed
Human pluripotent stem cells have the potential to play a major role in providing models of genetic disease. Early efforts were directed towards using hESCs, and there are about a dozen examples of where cases in which this has been achieved []. Lines carrying myotonic dystrophy type 1, cystic fibrosis and Huntington disease have been derived by isolating hESCs from pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) embryos []. However, PGD screens for only a limited number of genetic conditions, few scientists have access to these facilities and the use of embryos (even those that harbour detrimental genetic lesions) is ethically sensitive in many countries. Alternatively, gene targeting has been used to inactivate genes, such as HPRT1 in male hESCs, to produce an in vitro model of the metabolic disorder Lesch Nyhan syndrome []. However, while manipulation of the hPSC genome has become more routine in the last few years [], engineering specific polymorphisms, deletions or amplifications is time consuming, requires a reasonable level of skill, and becomes increasingly challenging proportionate with the number and complexity of modifications required, even when nuclease-based methods are used [].

In contrast, hiPSC technology is readily accessible, and has the potential to revolutionise in vitro disease modelling (; ). It is relatively straightforward for scientists to establish collaborations with clinicians who care for patients with a particular genetic condition, and the ethical frameworks for informed patient consent are commonplace within most universities and industrial settings. Many commercial providers of stem cell reagents now offer complete off-the-shelf kits to progress from patient sample to reasonably well characterised hiPSC lines. Consequently, less than 5 years after the first report of reprogramming somatic cells [], 63 hiPSC models have been produced for 43 diseases affecting the heart, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, immune system, skin, central nervous system, blood and eye, as well as imprinting, metabolic and multi-organ disorders (). It can be expected that the number of hiPSC lines available will rise exponentially over the next few years.

Grey areas indicate where drug treatment has been tested.

Current status and emerging technologies in disease modelling and drug screening for hiPSC-based models of human genetic disease. hiPCS-based models of human disease affecting the heart, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, skin, central nervous system (CNS), liver, blood and eye have been generated. However, only those affecting the heart, CNS and eye have been used to evaluate the effects of drug treatment. Emerging technologies for scale-up, automation and high throughput analysis will enable use of hiPSC-disease models for drug discovery and safety evaluation in an industrial setting. Green and blue arrows show processes amenable to scale-up and automation, or high-content imaging and electrophysiology analysis.

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that, with the exception of the eye disorder retinitis pigmentosa, only hiPSCs models affecting the heart and central nervous system have been used to evaluate effects of drug treatment in detail (; ). This highlights several critical factors that are often overlooked in hiPSC technology: How will the phenotype of the disease be quantified in vitro? How will benefits of different methods of therapeutic intervention be evaluated? If a disease phenotype is present, how does it relate to the patient's condition? Is the therapy tested in vitro relevant to the patient, and is there potential for clinical translation? As shown in , the level of genetic and/or pharmacological characterisation in the majority (46/63) of hiPSC models is limited, and the answers to these questions are outstanding.

Phenotype assessment in hiPSC-derived neurons and cardiomyocytes
Most progress has been made in phenotyping and evaluating drugs in hiPSC-based models of neurological and cardiac conditions (). Motor-, cortical- and dopaminergic-neurons from hiPSC harbouring mutations associated with neurodegenerative (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, schizophrenia) and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. Rett syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, familial dysautonomia) have been successfully generated. Quantitative phenotyping of these cells has indicated severe defects in growth, migration and function compared to healthy controls. They therefore provide platforms for drug validation (). For example, the known anti-psychotic drug, loxapine, has been shown to improve neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia models [], while compound E, a tobacco-derived γ-secretase inhibitor, decreased secretion of pathogenic Aβ42 in Alzheimer's models [, ]. Rett syndrome models have also been used for validation of experimental drugs such as gabazine, a GABAA receptor antagonist [].

Genetic disorders that affect the structure, ion channel composition and functionality in the heart also provide a quantifiable phenotypic readout. One of the consequences of the multi-system disorder of LEOPARD syndrome is cardiac hypertrophy, which has been partially phenocopied using hiPSC-cardiomyocytes []. The techniques of patch clamping and multi-electrode array (MEA) have proved valuable in interrogating electrophysiology from single or multi-cell clusters of cardiomyocytes, respectively []. Alterations in calcium handling can be visualised using realtime microscopy in the presence of calcium sensitive dyes []. Data from hiPSC lines carrying mutations that cause LQTS and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) are starting to produce evidence that patient-relevant phenotypes and drug response can be recreated in vitro. In the case of LQTS2, caused by mutations in the IKr channel, hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes developed arrhythmias when exposed to isoprenaline, a stressor used clinically to precipitate and diagnose the condition []. This effect could be reversed by applying the patient's own medication, nadolol, a β-blocker. Dantrolene and roscovitin, drugs known to be beneficial in moderating calcium flux, stabilised ion flux in hiPSC models of the calcium channel disorders, CPVT and Timothy syndrome (linked to LQT type 8), respectively –.

Human induced pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes are now providing novel routes to test more experimental drugs. The arrhythmias seen in the LQTS2 models were abolished by the potassium channel modulators, nicorandil and pinacidil (K+ATP channel openers) or PD-118057 (IKr channel activator) [, ]. Encouragingly, it has been shown that hiPSC-cardiomyocytes can replicate relatively subtle differences between patients. hiPSCs were produced from a healthy donor as well as from a mother and daughter, wherein the mother was clinically asymptomatic (no arrhythmias) with a moderately prolonged QT interval and the daughter was symptomatic with an excessively prolonged QT interval (arrhythmias, syncope and seizure episodes). Recording action potential durations from the different hiPSC-cardiomyocytes showed that the clinical profile was reflected in vitro (i.e. action potential longest in the daughter's cells, then the mother's, then the healthy control) and only hiPSC-cardiomyocytes produced from the daughter developed spontaneous arrhythmias []. Establishing whether such in vitro to in vivo associations hold true for other conditions will be important for hiPSC technologies to become widely accepted.

Assessing the need for humanised cardiotoxicity testing platforms
The ability to quantify functional responses in lineages such as hPSC-cardiomyocytes will likely find use in drug safety assessment. In recent years, high rates of drug attrition and withdrawal from market (because of unexpected cardiotoxicity) have imposed a multi-billion dollar burden on the pharmaceutical industry. More than ten drugs used to treat various non-cardiac conditions (e.g. inflammatory disease, psychosis, bacterial infection, pain) have been withdrawn from market because of unexpected side effects on the heart []. Side effects can damage the structural integrity and survival of cardiomyocytes, as is the case with the anti-inflammatory drug, Vioxx [] and many anti-cancer drugs, such as doxorubicin []. Beat regularity and duration (QT prolongation or shortening) can also be affected, which can lead to polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia, seizures and sudden death. Indeed, in 2010 this was the reason for the US FDA requesting withdrawal of propoxyphene, an opioid pain reliever marketed by Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals [], and of sibutramine, a weight loss agent marketed by Abbott Laboratories []. With development costs of each drug averaging $1.5 billion, high profile withdrawals are extremely damaging for the companies involved, as well as for patients taking the medication; the serotonin agonist, cisparide, caused 125 deaths before its use ceased [].

The use of suboptimal screening and safety assessment platforms underlies the reason for which drugs with potentially lethal side effects are not eliminated from the development pipeline before they reach the clinic. Early in most development pipelines, drugs are tested for channel modulating activity by utilising aneuploid cell lines (e.g. Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] or human embryonic kidney [HEK] cells) engineered to overexpress single ion channels. Such assays bear little relation to the complex multi-channel phenotype of functional cardiomyocytes []. This issue is illustrated by the in vitro culture responses seen with verapamil, a ‘safe’ drug in routine clinical use for treatment of hypertenstion, angina pectoris and cardiac arrhythmia. In CHO cells forced to overexpress HERG, verapamil blocks the potassium IKr channel, thereby predicting an association with prolonged QT interval []. In reality, while outward ion flux through IKr channels is blocked in functional cardiomyocytes, verapamil also blocks inward flux through L-type calcium channels (ICa-L), and the overall effect on QT interval is cancelled out []. Similarly, ranolazine, a drug used to treat angina, blocks opposing sodium INa and potassium IKr channels, with limited effect on QT duration [].

As discussed earlier, there are substantial differences in gene expression and physiology between species, which can limit the effectiveness of extrapolating toxicity from animals to humans. Indeed, data from non-rodents or rodents are respectively, 63 and 43% predictive of whether a drug will be toxic in humans. Even when data are combined from rodents (mice and rats) and non-rodents (dogs and monkeys), only 71% predictivity is achieved []. Notably, mice are at least 10× more tolerant to 37% of drugs than humans, while rats and dogs tolerate 4.5–100-fold the concentration of various chemotherapeutic agents as humans (e.g. ThioTEPA, Myleran, Actinomycin-D, Mitomycin C, Mithramycin, Fludarabine) []. Conversely, potentially valuable drugs might be eliminated during development because of overt toxicity in animals, when in fact they might be completely innocuous in humans. By way of example, chocolate and coffee can cause organ failure and death in dogs. This is because, relative to humans, the methylxanine ingredients, theobromine and caffeine, of these foods are poorly metabolised in dogs, which leads to potentially fatal toxic build up [].

Despite these inadequacies, regulatory guidelines (e.g. international conference on harmonisation; ICH S7B) require extensive animal use in safety assessment because predictivity of current in vitro assays is insufficient. This has major implications for the number of animals used, and is not in line with the developing 3Rs (replacement, refinement and reduction of animal use) policies of many countries. For example, in the UK in 2008, a total of 475,290 animal procedures were performed to supply the needs of drug safety assessment and toxicity testing []. New EU regulation for the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (termed REACH) will require toxicological testing of 30,000 compounds, and some reports suggest that this will require up to 54 million animals over the next 10 years in Europe alone [, ].

These observations lead to the conclusion that any new human-based in vitro assays that improve or complement existing tests would benefit 1. patients through better drug safety; 2. the 3Rs, through reduced animal use; and 3. pharmaceutical companies, through reduced preclinical costs and drug withdrawals.

Progress towards using hPSC-cardiomyocytes in cardiac safety assessment
In the last few years, tremendous progress has been made in improving the efficiency and robustness of cardiac differentiation from hPSCs, thereby providing a renewable source of human cardiomyocytes. The three differentiation strategies employed are formation of (i) three-dimensional aggregates known as embryoid bodies, (ii) two-dimensional monolayers or (iii) co-cultures with an inducer cell line such as END-2; these methods have recently been reviewed []. The cardiomyocytes display many of the gene expression patterns associated with in vivo development of the heart, including gene expression, ion channel formation, electrophysiological responsiveness and excitation-contraction coupling [].

These attributes suggest that hPSC-cardiomyocytes could provide a human-based in vitro assay system for drug testing. Indeed, the pharmacological responses of hPSC-cardiomyocytes have been quantified from nearly 60 different compounds and drugs (). While the range of agents is extensive, most studies have only used one or two concentrations of drug that are at the upper end or exceed clinically relevant doses. Nonetheless, several important points are emerging, as considered below (see also  and , and references therein).

First, functionality in hPSC-cardiomyocytes has been shown for many of the key ion channels (potassium: IKs, IKr, If, Ito, IK1; sodium: INa; calcium: ICa-L, SERCA2a) and regulator molecules (e.g. receptors: muscarinic, adrenoceptors, acetylcholine, ryanodine) found at the cell membrane or in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Second, functional responses can be quantified by methods of relevance to the pharmaceutical industry, such as patch clamp electrophysiology and calcium detection. Third, responses can be measured from cardiomyocytes derived from a range of healthy and disease-carrying hPSC lines. Fourth, the complex multi-ion channel phenotype of hPSC-cardiomyocytes provides an advantage over CHO cells forced to overexpress a single channel. Dual channel blocking agents such verapamil (blocks IKr and ICa-L) and ranolazine (blocks IKr and INa) are QT-neutral when clinically relevant doses are applied to hPSC-cardiomyocytes. Fifth, in some cases, hPSC-cardiomyocytes can detect toxic effects at lower doses than is possible in animal systems. We have found that the IKr blocker, risperidone, causes increased field potential duration of hPSC-cardiomyocytes at 0.1 µM [], but data from GlaxoSmithKline indicate that prolongation occurs in guinea-pig myocytes at 1 µM. Moreover, direct comparison between hPSC-cardiomyocytes and myocytes isolated from dogs or rabbits concluded that the human cells more accurately predicted moxifloxacin-induced cardiotoxicity []. Finally, a careful study examined drug effects over a 6-log dose-response range that covered the estimated unbound therapeutic plasma concentrations []. There was good association between clinical and hPSC-cardiomyocyte toxicity for drugs such as quinidine and d,l-sotalol known to prolong QT interval, whereas drugs with a low incidence of arrhythmogenesis (e.g. cisapride, terfenadine, sertindole, sparfloxacin) only caused prolongation of field potential duration at higher doses [].

Limitations and challenges to overcome in hPSC technology
The emerging data for disease modelling and drug screening are encouraging. However, this is a new field with limitations yet to be overcome. Although hESCs are often considered the gold standard, these cells are derived from spare embryos donated by couples experiencing fertility problems, hence the need for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment. It is known that different methods of embryo culture can alter epigenetic status []. For hiPSC derivation, delivery of reprogramming factors can be achieved by viral (e.g. retroviruses, lentiviruses, adenoviruses, sendaivirus) or non-viral (episomes, plasmids, miRNA, mRNA and protein) strategies []. It is notable that virtually all disease models have used the ‘original’ retroviral and lentiviral methods () [, ], and a potential concern is random integration of the viral genome into the host genome []. Assessment is further complicated, because it depends on whether the reprogramming factors are contained on single or multiple vectors, and whether small molecule enhancers of hiPSC production were used [, ]. There is not yet a consensus on the cell type to reprogram [], although skin and blood cells are preferred because of the ease of patient consent, minimal discomfort to the patient, and accessibility. Each of these variables has the capacity to alter the genotype, epigenome and phenotype of the hiPSCs produced, as well as the subsequently derived differentiated lineages. Therefore, it is difficult to know whether problems reported for hiPSC (e.g. transfer of epigenetic legacy from somatic cells to hiPSC, improper reprogramming/disease modelling [e.g. Fragile X] or genetic instability) [] are inherent to the technology or are a consequence of the reprogramming method(s) used. Detailed studies to resolve these issues are required, as is a consensus of the best cell type to reprogram and how.

In addition to the careful consideration of how disease presentation will be phenotyped in vitro (discussed earlier), there is also an issue of whether hPSC derivatives mature sufficiently in culture to make them fit for their intended purpose. To date, drug treatment and phenotypic studies in hiPSC-derived neurons have been more successful for neurodevelopmental disorders than late-onset neurodegenerative disorders, likely because of the foetal-like properties of the cells []. The absence of functional potassium channels (IK1) and shifted activation of sodium channels (INa) indicates an immature status of hPSC-cardiomyocytes, and has raised concerns about their suitability in drug screening []. Therefore it is encouraging that maturation of hPSC-cardiomyocytes can be facilitated by prolonged time culture [, ], transgenic overexpression of calsequestrin [], formation of 3D aggregates [], tissue-engineered constructs and mechanical stress [, ].

It is unlikely that hiPSC technology will successfully model all disorders. The epigenetic status that underlies some diseases will be erased during somatic cell reprogramming, while for other conditions a suitable phenotype may not be present in an in vitro setting []. Although several studies have now demonstrated robust association with the phenotypes and drug responses seen in hiPSCs models with known patient pathologies (e.g. LQTS), similar validation is required for a broad range of conditions (). The timing of some late onset conditions may exceed the lifespan of hiPSC-derivatives in culture, and innovative strategies are required. For example, the dopaminergic neurons differentiated from hiPSCs carrying a mutation in the PINK1 gene (causes Parkinson's disease) only showed altered patterns of survival when additionally treated with a mitochondrial stressor []. Finally, differentiation of the hiPSC into relevant cell types is necessary. So far, hiPSC modelling has been restricted to about 10 tissue or organ systems () and future work will be needed to expand this range.

Industrial scalability of hPSC technologies
For hPSC derivatives to be used for disease modelling and drug screening at an industrial level (), sufficient numbers of cells need to be produced in a cost-effective manner. Undifferentiated hPSCs have been produced using stirred bioreactors in suspension [] and using fully automated robotic platforms such as the CompacT SelecT, which cultures adherent cells in up to 90 T175 flasks []. However, the cost of the reagents for hPSC culture is prohibitive because of the reliance of expensive culture media that contain various growth factors. To this end, high throughput screening has sought to identify putative chemicals that maintain pluripotency in the absence of growth factors or that improve cell survival after passage –. Such approaches have identified a series of inhibitors of the Rho kinase pathway and prosurvival compounds such as Y27632 that are now used by many labs during routine hPSC culture. The same degree of success has not been achieved in replacing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which remains the gold standard for maintaining hPSC pluripotency in many labs.

Similar to the undifferentiated state, scaled production of differentiated lineages has been achieved, but also tends to rely on costly growth factors; in the case of hPSC-cardiomyocytes these typically include bFGF, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4) and activin A []. Commercial production of hPSC-cardiomyocytes is now in progress, with GE-healthcare, Cellular Dynamics International and Cellartis/Cellectis charging approximately $2000–3000 per vial of ∼1 million cells. It is encouraging that small molecules that promote cardiac differentiation are being identified from high throughput screens and from rational compound selection (). Time- and concentration-dependent application of the BMP inhibitor, dorsomorphin, has proved to be highly effective in improving cardiomyocyte differentiation efficiencies []. In time, it is hoped that such strategies will allow hPSC-cardiomyocytes to be produced to short time scales, in large quantities at low cost. This goal has been achieved for production of &gt;3 × 109 mPSC-cardiomyocytes in stirred bioreactors []. Elegant work has also shown pipeline conversion of mouse fibroblasts into iPSCs and then into iPSC-cardiomyocytes in a single suspension bioreactor []; the challenge now is to translate the high efficiency ‘inducible secondary’ iPSC reprogramming into a technology that is compatible with human cells.

Progress towards high throughput analysis
In an industrial setting, drug discovery and safety evaluation relies on high content imaging of many thousands of wells in 96-, 384- and 1,536-well plates (). Various manufacturers offer fully automated platforms [] such as BD pathway (BD Biosciences), In Cell Analyser 2000 (GE-healthcare), ImageXpress (Molecular Devices), Opera (Perkin Elmer) and Cellomics Arrayscan (ThermoFisher). These deliver a vast array of information on cell physiology and function, including cell number, cell shape/size, proliferation, viability, membrane integrity, phagocytosis, apoptosis, cell migration, cell-cell contacts and organelle health (e.g. numbers, size, shape, activity of nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes) []. Fluorescent assays are also used to readout on G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activity, calcium handling and transgenic reporter expression []. As discussed above, such platforms have been used to evaluate molecules that help maintain pluripotency or promote differentiation of hPSCs but they are starting to find use in phenotypic evaluation of differentiated cells. The Cellomics Arrayscan platform was used to evaluate the effect of various modulators of hypertrophy (e.g. angiotensin II, phenylephrine, p38-MAPK) on cell morphology of hPSC-cardiomyocytes by examining 1,000–1,500 cells per well in 96-well plate formats []. Data have been presented by Cellular Dynamics International on quantification of the cardiotoxic effect of valinomycin, etoposide and rotenone in hPSC-cardiomyocytes using high content imaging of changes in mitochondrial and lysosomal physiology, DNA damage and oxidative stress. At a recent Predictive Toxicology Meeting in London (February 2012), data from GE-healthcare showed how 26 anti-cancer agents changed 19 different cell morphological and functional parameters in hPSC-cardiomyocytes. The analysis was carried out on three replicates, two timepoints and seven doses in a 384-well plate format using the In Cell 2000 platform. This analysis produced graphical profile sets that were associated with high, moderate, low or no drug-induced cellular toxicity.

High throughput electrophysiology provides a route to recording functional readouts from viable cells. The pharmaceutical industry uses PatchXpress, IonWorks and QT-screen to assess the effect of channel modulators on transgenic CHO cells overexpressing IKr potassium channel. Recently, it was demonstrated that high purity hPSC-cardiomyocytes could be adapted to the PatchXpress platform []. This allowed simultaneous recording from 16 channels and the authors quantified the effect of tetrodotoxin, nifedipine and E4031 on INa, ICa-L and IKr, respectively []. Further integration of hPSC-derivatives into high throughput platforms will help accelerate the use of these cells by the pharmaceutical industry.

Conclusions and future perspectives
Recent developments have boosted the likelihood of widespread use of hPSC-derivatives in disease modelling and drug development. Reprogramming somatic cells with four genetic factors has allowed rapid derivation of many hiPSC disease models. Differentiation efficiencies have radically improved, while clinical pathologies have been demonstrably replicated in cardiac and neural hiPSC-based models. Such models respond appropriately to pharmacological challenge, particularly for LQTS and potassium or calcium channel blockers. Nevertheless, hPSC technology requires improvements. Standardised methods that stabilise the genotype, epigenome and phenotype of hPSCs and their derivatives are paramount, as are methods to quantify phenotypic responses in lineages other than hPSC-cardiomyocytes and neurons. Current differentiation methods yield heterogeneous populations of immature cells; for cardiomyocytes, this includes ventricular, atrial and pacemaker subtypes [], but mature ventricular cells are most relevant to drug safety assessment. Although hPSCs and their derivatives are adaptable to high throughput screening, current methods are not cost effective. These are surmountable issues, especially when driven by the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, where industry figures show that 98% of sales are based on products of &gt;5 years old. 110,000 jobs have recently been lost in the US, and patent expiry will cost the industry USD$130 during 2011–2014. Not surprisingly, most major pharmaceutical companies now have in-house stem cell programmes, and collaborate with academic groups or purchase hPSC products from commercial suppliers []. Just as new bioinformatics approaches are being applied to predict adverse drug interactions [], so too will hPSC technologies in order to further understand disease and develop new drugs. Estimates indicate that even if an assay improves predictability of toxicity in humans by just 1%, up to $100 million will be saved by the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, even small, incremental, improvements can be extremely worthwhile pursuing.
