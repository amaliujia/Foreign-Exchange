Brain and Behavior 2012; 2(6): 806–813

On page 807, we made some mistakes in the description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Specifically,

we did not exclude smokers;

we did not ask participants about medication use;

the age range was not 18–35 years, but 17–39 years.

We regret these errors. They have no consequences for the reported analyses and conclusions.
