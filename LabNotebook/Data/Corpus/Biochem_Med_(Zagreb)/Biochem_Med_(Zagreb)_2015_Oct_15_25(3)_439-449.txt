Although prostatitis is a common male urinary tract infection, clinical
diagnosis of prostatitis is difficult. The developmental mechanism of
prostatitis is not yet unraveled which led to the elaboration of various
biomarkers. As changes in asparagine-linked-(N-)-glycosylation were observed
between healthy volunteers (HV), patients with benign prostate hyperplasia
and prostate cancer patients, a difference could exist in biochemical
parameters and urinary N-glycosylation between HV and prostatitis patients.
We therefore investigated if prostatic protein glycosylation could improve
the diagnosis of prostatitis.

Materials and methods
Differences in serum and urine biochemical markers and in total urine
N-glycosylation profile of prostatic proteins were determined between HV (N
= 66) and prostatitis patients (N = 36). Additionally, diagnostic accuracy
of significant biochemical markers and changes in N-glycosylation was
assessed.

Results
Urinary white blood cell (WBC) count enabled discrimination of HV from
prostatitis patients (P &lt; 0.001). Urinary bacteria count allowed for
discriminating prostatitis patients from HV (P &lt; 0.001). Total amount of
biantennary structures (urinary 2A/MA marker) was significantly lower in
prostatitis patients compared to HV (P &lt; 0.001). Combining the urinary
2A/MA marker and urinary WBC count resulted in an AUC of 0.79, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = (0.70–0.89) which was significantly better
than urinary WBC count (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.59–0.82], P = 0.042)
as isolated test.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated the diagnostic value of urinary N-glycosylation
profiling, which shows great potential as biomarker for prostatitis. Further
research is required to unravel the developmental course of prostatic
inflammation.

Introduction
Prostatitis is a common male urinary tract infection with global prevalence ranging
from 2.2% to 9.7% (1). The
term prostatitis describes a combination of infectious diseases which have been
classified into 4 syndromes by the National Institutes of Health (2, 3): acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic
bacterial prostatitis, chronic non-bacterial prostatitis (inflammatory and
non-inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome), and, asymptomatic inflammatory
prostatitis.

Clinical presentation of prostatitis is heterogeneous as it is based on patients
symptoms, mainly pain at various locations and different degrees of lower urinary
tract symptoms (LUTS, e.g. pain at the lower urinary tract, pain in the lower
abdomen, pain at the perineal region, difficult voiding, frequent need to void, pain
on urination or pain that increases with urination), and on presence of leukocyturia
and bacteriuria (3, 4). The diagnosis may however
be difficult due to several reasons: non-specific symptoms can arise (3), bacteria are only detected
in 5 to 10% of cases (3,
5), and another
underlying pathology, e.g. benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer (PCa)
and bladder carcinoma, could be present (3, 6).

As the developmental mechanism of prostatitis is still unraveled, other inflammatory
markers, such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (7), and non-classic biomarkers,
namely serum creatinine, urinary α1-microglobulin / creatinine ratio, urinary
α2-macroglobulin/creatinine ratio and urinary
α2-macroglobulin / albumin ratio (8, 9), have been examined for their potential use in
prostatitis diagnosis. Currently, none of these parameters have been implemented in
clinical routine laboratories.

Glycosylation studies have pointed out that infection and/or inflammation may alter
the glycosylation patterns of host proteins. Two major hypotheses on the mechanisms
of these glycosylation alterations are: changes in metabolic activity, thus altering
the availability of the carbohydrate donor molecules needed for the formation of
complex asparagine-linked (N-) glycan structures by the Golgi enzymes; and/or;
increased and rapid proliferation during an immune response which overcomes the
limits of the glycosylation pathway, restricting the relative amount of modification
and complexity (10).

We have recently developed a technique to determine the N-glycosylation profile of
urinary prostate proteins (11). By means of this technique, we have proven that
differences in N-glycans enabled distinction between BPH and PCa and that
N-glycosylation profiling could have an added value to PCa diagnosis, especially in
the diagnostic gray zone of serum prostate specific antigen (sPSA) concentrations
between 4 and 10 µg/L (12).

Because changes in N-glycosylation were observed between healthy volunteers (HV),
patients with BPH and PCa patients (12), we hypothesized that a difference could exist
in biochemical parameters and urinary N-glycosylation between HV and prostatitis
patients. As the use of N-glycomics has never been tested in prostatic inflammation,
our objective in this diagnostic accuracy study is to determine whether changes in
N-glycosylation patterns can differentiate between healthy volunteers (HV) and
prostatitis patients and if these differences can improve prostatitis diagnosis.

Materials and methods
Subjects
From July 2012 to May 2015, a cohort of 36 prostatitis patients presenting at the
Department of Urology at the Ghent University Hospital were continuously
recruited and prospectively analyzed in our diagnostic accuracy study.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria consisted of: patients with at least one of the
following symptoms of prostatitis: pain at the lower urinary tract, pain in the
lower abdomen, pain at the perineal region, difficult voiding, frequent need to
void, pain on urination or pain that increases with urination; but did not
suffer from PCa. Acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis was confirmed on
urinalysis: urinary white blood cell (WBC) count &gt; 25 cells/µL and/or
urinary bacteria count &gt; 11.4 bacteria/µL (reference test). sPSA
concentration was not used as inclusion criteria for prostatitis patients.
Patients were included within 6 weeks of onset of symptoms at which time a
digital rectal examination (DRE) was performed (no DRE was performed at time of
onset in order to prevent urosepsis (3)). Prostatitis patients consisted of 16 acute
bacterial prostatitis patients (of which 8 received antibiotic treatment); 9
chronic bacterial prostatitis patients (of which 4 received antibiotic
treatment); and 11 chronic non-bacterial prostatitis patients (non-inflammatory
chronic pelvic pain syndrome).

Healthy volunteers (N = 66) were enrolled as a reference group for comparison
with the patient cohort and consisted of personnel from the Ghent University
Hospital and family members of patients presenting at the Department of Urology
at the Ghent University Hospital. Criteria used to enroll HV were: aged between
18 and 50 years, not suffering from any prostate pathology (BPH / PCa / LUTS or
history of LUTS) and no first- or second-line family member (father or brother)
with PCa diagnosed before the age of 65.

Informed consent was given by all participants and the study was approved by the
local Ethics Committee (Belgian registration number: B670201214356).

Methods
One Venosafe® VF-106SAS plastic serum silicone coated gel tube (Terumo
Medical Corporation; Somerset, NJ, USA) was collected before DRE. The blood
sample was allowed to coagulate during 30 min and centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 10
minutes. The samples were analyzed for sPSA within 1 hour following sampling.
Urine samples were collected directly after DRE in 60 mL urine containers
(International Medical Products n.v.; Brussels, Belgium). A 5 mL portion was
transferred to 5 mL ultraclear polypropylene storage tubes (Deltalab, S.L.;
Barcelona, Spain) and centrifuged at 3000 RPM for 10 minutes. The centrifuged
urine was aliquoted into 2 portions: 3 mL was transferred to 5 mL ultraclear
polypropylene storage tubes for urinary biochemical analysis and 500 µL
was transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf® Safe-Lock microcentrifuge tubes
(Novolab NV; Geraardsbergen, Belgium) for N-glycosylation analysis. Aliquot for
urine N-glycosylation analysis was preserved at -20 °C until assayed
(within 1 week after preservation of the urine samples).

We used Cobas® 8000 modular P analyzer series (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) to measure total urinary protein
concentrations and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity in urine. Total
urinary protein was assayed by means of a robust pyrogallol-based dye binding
method (13) using the
Total Protein Reagent Pyrogallol Red Method with SDS reagent standardized
according to Total Protein Standard Concentration 1000 mg/L (within run
coefficient of variation (CV) = 2.1%, between run CV = 2.1%). Upper reference
values limit is taken at 0.2 g/L. All reagents and controls are commercially
available (Instruchemie BV, Delfzijl, The Netherlands).

Urinary GGT activity was assessed to determine the presence of acute kidney
injury (14, 15). This assay was
performed to determine the possible influence of highly glycosylated liver
proteins on the urine N-glycosylation profile. Urinary GGT activity was measured
through kinetic photometric determination (16) using the commercially available GGT-2 kit
(Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) with within run CV = 1.1% and
between run CV = 1.3%. Normal male values range between 12 and 64 U/L.

Immunonephelometry on a BN Nephelometer II analyzer (Siemens Healthcare, Marburg,
Germany) was used to determine the albumin concentration in urine using
commercially available N Antiserum to human albumin with N Protein standard SL
as control (within run CV = 2.2%, between run CV = 8.9%). Reference values range
from 0 to 20 mg/L. All reagents and controls are commercially available (Siemens
Healthcare, Marburg, Germany).

sPSA, urinary total PSA (tPSA) and urinary free PSA (fPSA) were assayed by means
of electrochemiluminescence immunoassay on a Modular E170 analyzer series (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and standardized against the PreciControl
Tumor marker 1 and 2. sPSA and urinary tPSA were assessed by means of the total
PSA kit (within run CV for PreciControl Tumor marker 1 and 2 = 1.9% and = 0.8%,
respectively; between run CV = 4.2% and = 4.6%, respectively). Urinary fPSA was
determined using the free PSA kit (within run CV for PreciControl Tumor marker 1
and 2 = 1.9% and = 0.8%, respectively; between run CV =2.0% and = 1.9%,
respectively). All reagents and controls are commercially available (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).

Urinary red blood cell (RBC) count (/µL), urinary white blood cell (WBC)
count (/µL) and urinary bacteria count (/µL) were determined using
a Sysmex UF-1000i® urinary flow cytometer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe,
Japan). The system uses a semiconductor laser instrument to perform automated
microscopic analysis and to automatically detect, identify and count RBCs, WBCs
and bacteria (17, 18) with UF-Control as
quality control (within run CV =2.2%, = 6.6% and = 9.2%, respectively; between
run CV = 3.0%, = 2.0%, and = 3.0%, respectively). All reagents and controls used
are commercially available (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan). Upper reference
limits implemented are 25 RBC/µL, 25 WBC/µL and 11.4
bacteria/µL.

As previously described, urinary prostate protein N-glycans were determined using
a multicapillary electrophoresis-based ABI3130 sequencer. Urinary prostate
protein N-glycans were released using an on-membrane deglycosylation method and
labeled with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulphonic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR,USA). Subsequently, the glycans were desialylated overnight at 37 °C
by the addition of 2 µL of 10 mM ammonium acetate pH 5.0 containing 40 mU
of Arthrobacter ureafaciens α-2,3/6/8-sialidase
(provided by the laboratory of Prof. Nico Callewaert, Unit for Medical
Biotechnology, Inflammation Research Center, VIB—Ghent University, Ghent,
Belgium). The desialylated N-glycan samples and a reference maltooligosaccharide
ladder (dextran from Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) were analyzed with a multicapillary electrophoresis-based
ABI3130 sequencer. The peaks were analyzed with GeneMapper version 3.7 software
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and peak height intensities were
normalized to the total intensity of the measured peaks (11). The method showed analytical
variability of less than 5%. The difference in total amount of biantennary
structures / multiantennary structures was named the ‘urinary 2A/MA
marker’, the difference in total amount of triantennary structures /
multiantennary structures was named the ‘urinary 3A/MA marker’,
and, the difference in total amount of tetraantennary structures /
multiantennary structures was named the ‘urinary 4A/MA marker’.
The different markers used for distinction of prostatitis patients from HV are
given in Figure 1.

relative fluorescence units. On top, a maltooligosaccharide ladder
(dextran) is shown to determine the amount of structural units in each
glycan structure. Identified glycosylation structures shown in the
figure. Glycan symbols are those suggested by the Consortium for
Functional Glycomics (http://glycomics.scripps.edu/CFGnomenclature.pdf). Man6
stands for a mannose-rich structure that consists of 6 mannose and 2
N-acetylglucosamine units. The concept of the figure was adapted from
previously reported N-glycan profiles determined by means of the same
technique (11).
An increase was observed in the urinary 2A/MA marker (ratio [peaks
D+E+F] / [peaks D till J]) of prostatitis patients compared to HV (green
arrows) while the urinary 3A/MA marker (ratio [peaks G+H] / [peaks D
till J]), and, the urinary 4A/MA marker (ratio [peaks I+J] / [peaks D
till J]) were decreased in prostatitis patients compared to HV (red
arrows).

Statistical analysis
All participants were eligible for statistical analysis. Normal distribution of
the subject groups was verified by D’Agostino-Pearson test. Overall
differences between HV and prostatitis patients were analyzed by means of
unpaired Student’s t-test (for normally distributed groups), Mann-Whitney
U-test (for non-normally distributed groups), or Fischer exact test for
categorical data. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was
used to determine criterion value of the urinary 2A/MA marker (index test) and
to calculate area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of the
marker with their respective 95% confidence interval (CI). Further analysis
compared the ROC curve of the urinary 2A/MA marker with that of urinary WBC
count (criterion ≥ 25 cells/µL) and urinary bacteria count
(criterion ≥ 11.4 bacteria/µL). Criterion values for urinary WBC
count and urinary bacteria count were based on reference values currently used
in our laboratory. Post-hoc calculation of criterion values was
used to compare sensitivity and specificity of the post-hoc
calculated criterion with those of the reference criterion currently used.
Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the additive diagnostic
value of the urinary 2A/MA marker next to urinary WBC and bacteria count, and to
calculate odds ratio (OR). Next, all prostatis patients were subdivided into
acute versus chronic prostatis patients and into bacterial
versus non-bacterial prostatis patients in order to assess
differences in biochemical markers and N-glycans between these subgroups.
P-values &lt; 0.050 were considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were performed with MedCalc Statistical Software version 13.3.1.0
(MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) and GraphPad Prism version 4.7 (GraphPad
Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

Results
Baseline characteristics
The subjects’ baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Overall median sPSA concentration
was significantly higher in prostatitis patients compared to HV (P &lt; 0.001;
Figure 2A), as was the urinary albumin
concentration (P &lt; 0.001; Figure 2B).
Next, urinary WBC count and urinary bacteria count was higher in prostatitis
patients compared to HV (both P &lt; 0.001; Figure
2C-D). Furthermore, urinary WBC count was significantly different
when comparing acute versus chronic prostatitis (P = 0.029;
Figure 2E) and in the comparison
between bacterial versus non-bacterial prostatitis (P &lt;
0.001; Figure 2F) whereas urinary bacteria
count differed only between bacterial and non-bacterial prostatitis (P = 0.002;
Figure 2H) and was not significant
between acute versus chronic prostatitis (P = 0.610; Figure 2G). None of the other biochemical
markers was significantly different between prostatitis patients and HV (P &gt;
0.050).

Changes in glycosylation patterns
All obtained N-glycan structures were examined. Normalization and analysis of the
relative peak heights showed a difference between the N-glycan profiles of HV
and prostatitis patients (Figure 1). A
significant increase of the urinary 2A/MA marker was found in the N-glycan
profile of prostatitis patients compared to HV (P &lt; 0.001; Figure 3A), which was the direct result of a
decrease of the urinary 3A/MA and 4A/MA marker in prostatitis patients (P =
0.008 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively; Figure
3B-C). No difference was observed in the percentage of overall
core-α-1,6-fucosylation (P = 0.051; Figure
3D). Also, no differences in N-glycosylation were found between all
types of prostatitis or between bacterial and non-bacterial prostatitis (P &gt;
0.050).

Diagnostic accuracy of urinary WBC count,&#8232;urinary bacteria count and
the urinary 2A/MA marker in differentiating HV from prostatitis patients
The urinary 2A/MA marker showed fair diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI
[0.63-0.81], comparable to urinary WBC count (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI [0.59-0.82])
and urinary bacteria count (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI [0.58-0.82]; Figure 4). These tests did not differ significantly from
each other (P = 0.508 and P = 0.586, respectively). Table 2 summarizes the discriminative power with matching
sensitivity and specificity for these parameters in discriminating HV from
prostatitis patients. Use of reference criterion values for urinary WBC count
and urinary bacteria count resulted in a higher specificity while the use of the
post-hoc calculated criterion value gave a higher sensitivity. Next, using
multivariate logistic regression, urinary WBC and bacteria count were combined
with the urinary 2A/MA marker (Table 2)
which favored the combination of urinary WBC count and the urinary 2A/MA marker
(urinary bacteria count was not included in the model). This combination of
tests achieved fair diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI [0.70-0.89]) which
was significantly better compared to urinary WBC as isolated test (P = 0.042)
but not to urinary bacteria count (P = 0.156; Figure 4).

Analysis demonstrated AUC of 0.70, 95% CI [0.58-0.82]; 0.70, 95% CI

(dashed line), urinary WBC count (thin full line) and the urinary 2A/MA
marker (dotted line), respectively. No significant differences were
observed between the isolated tests (P &gt; 0.050). Combining urinary
WBC count and the urinary 2A/MA marker (bold full line) resulted in an
AUC of 0.79, 95% CI [0.70-0.89]; which was significantly better compared
to urinary WBC count (P = 0.042) as isolated test but not to urinary

Discussion
In our research, we assessed if differences existed between the urinary
N-glycosylation profile of HV compared to prostatitis patients and if these
differences could assist in the diagnosis of prostatitis. Here we reported that
changes in several serum and urinary biochemical markers occurred when comparing HV
to prostatitis patients. The biochemical parameter usable for the distinction
between HV and prostatitis patients were sPSA concentration, urinary WBC count and
urinary bacteria count; which were increased in prostatic inflammation. Next, we
observed a lower amount of urinary tri- and tetraantennary N-glycans (3A/MA and
4A/MA marker, respectively) which resulted in an increase of biantennary structures
(2A/MA marker). Combining urinary WBC count and the 2A/MA marker proved favorable
for prostatitis diagnosis compared to urinary WBC count as isolated test.

The most important parameter for the distinction between HV and prostatitis patients
was urinary WBC count. Notable was that the reference criterion (&gt; 25
cells/µL) was higher than the post-hoc calculated criterion
(&gt; 14.6 cells/µL). The same was noticed for the criterion value of urinary
bacteria count (routinely used criterion &gt; 11.4 bacteria/µL; calculated
criterion &gt; 6.5 bacteria/µL). This is probable due to the bias that
prostatitis patients were enrolled in the study until 6 weeks after onset of their
symptoms and that some of them had already received antibiotic treatment. The
urinary bacteria count proved also significantly to differentiate prostatitis
patients and HV. Again, this result is hard to interpret due to the design of our
study and the fact that some of the prostatitis patients already received antibiotic
treatment.

Next, the use of sPSA as a marker for prostatitis is contradictory as an elevated
sPSA concentration can be the result of underlying subclinical disease such as BPH
or PCa (6). Furthermore,
Pansadoro et al. (19) found that in 72 prostatitis patients under 50
year of age only 71% of patients with acute bacterial prostatitis, 15% of patients
with chronic bacterial prostatitis and 6% of patients with chronic non-bacterial
prostatitis had an elevated sPSA concentration (&gt; 4 µg/L) because of
increased vascular permeability and disrupted prostate gland epithelium. Nadler
et al. (20) even stated that sPSA, although slightly increased
in patients with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis (mean sPSA concentration = 1.97
µg/L, standard deviation = 2.87 µg/L), is not usable as biomarker for
prostatitis due to the low sensitivity and specificity. Another study that evaluated
the diagnostic performance of sPSA in prostatitis reported a decrease of the ratio
free sPSA / total sPSA in acute bacterial prostatitis. We were unable to observe
this difference for urinary PSA concentrations indicating that no error occurs in
PSA synthesis in the prostate gland during inflammation of the prostate gland (21).

In contrast, we noticed that urinary albumin concentration was higher in prostatitis
patients compared to HV. This could be the consequence of leakage through the
prostate gland. However, this parameter is of no significance for the
differentiation of prostatitis patients as it was within normal reference parameters
(0-20 mg/L) (22).

Furthermore, we investigated the clinical utility of urinary N-glycosylation analysis
in prostatitis diagnosis. As a post-translational modification, N-glycosylation is
highly sensitive to its environment and can be affected by disease status (23). The urinary 2A/MA marker
enabled distinction between prostatitis patients and HV, with similar diagnostic
accuracy to urinary WBC and bacteria count. Combining this urinary 2A/MA marker with
urinary WBC count even improved the diagnostic performance for prostatitis detection
compared to urinary WBC as isolated test.

The proposed combination of markers could show high potential for use in prostatitis
diagnosis with some great advantages. Firstly, a model for prostatitis detection
combining urinary WBC count and the urinary 2A/MA marker improved diagnostic
accuracy by 9% which would greatly decrease the number of false-negatives derived by
urinary WBC count and facilitate the difficult diagnosis of prostatitis
patients.

Secondly, our test uses a non-invasive method to obtain the urine samples. As the
combination of urinary WBC count and the urinary 2A/MA marker achieved a fair
diagnostic accuracy, this could possible decrease the need for invasive serum
sampling to determine other inflammatory markers, e.g. C-reactive protein.

Thirdly, as this technique is easy to use without prior need for extensive training,
easily repeatable, and affordable, implementation of this test in centers with high
number of urological specimens could be advisable.

An important remark is that HV are not age-matched with the patient groups. As
reported in previous publications (11, 12), this was done deliberate to exclude presence
of subclinical BPH or PCa in the HV group. However, this study design did not render
the results less powerful because no differences were observed in N-glycosylation
profiling when HV were subdivided into 3 age-increasing categories (12).

Surprisingly, we were unable to notice a difference between the N-glycosylation
profile of acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis and chronic
non-bacterial prostatitis, nor when prostatitis patients were subdivided into acute
versus chronic prostatitis patients or into bacterial
versus non-bacterial prostatitis patients. This is probable due
to the design of our study and as a direct effect thereof, the low number of
patients in the prostatitis cohort.

Finally, an interesting finding is that no difference in overall
core-α-1,6-fucosylation was found between HV and prostatitis patients, while
previously this glycosylation change proved significant in the differentiation
between HV, patients with BPH and PCa patients (12). However both prostatitis and BPH, which is
characterized as an immune-mediated inflammatory disease with characteristics of
chronic inflammation and significantly more infiltrated T-lymphocytes, macrophages
and B-lymphocytes (24-27), showed a decrease in
triantennary structures. This finding would indicate that the change in total amount
of tri- and tetraantennary structures / multiantennary structures could be
associated with an inflammatory responses while the change in overall
core-α-1,6-fucosylation is more likely an indicator of cancer progression.
Both changes could possibly be linked as it has been stated that an inflammatory
environment can be mutagenic and promote cancer progression, although there is still
no evidence of a causal relation between inflammation and PCa (24, 28-30).

In summary, we have demonstrated the diagnostic value of N-glycosylation profiling
from urinary prostate proteins, as a possible biomarker for differentiating HV from
prostatitis patients. Further research is however warranted. An increased number of
prostatitis patients could allow validating differences in N-glycan profiles between
acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, chronic pelvic pain
syndrome and asymptomatic prostatic inflammation which would have a great benefit
for prostatitis diagnosis. Furthermore, comparison of N-glycosylation at time of
disease onset and post treatment could help unravel the developmental course of
prostatic inflammation indicate which patients are sensitive to chronification of
prostatitis. Lastly, comparison between prostatitis, BPH and PCa is needed as it
could further indicate the possible role of inflammation in the development of
PCa.
