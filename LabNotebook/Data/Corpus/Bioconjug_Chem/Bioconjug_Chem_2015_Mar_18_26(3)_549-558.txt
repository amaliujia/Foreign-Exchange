Introduction
Molecular imaging is
gaining importance for noninvasive assessment
of biological events in animal and human subjects. Through in vivo
real-time visualization and imaging quantification of biological targets
of interest, a better understanding of the biological processes underlining
the initiation and progression of diseases can be obtained for more
efficacious diagnosis and treatment., However, a
single imaging technique is often unable to deliver all the necessary
information required for a definitive clinical decision. To date,
successful attempts have been seen to combine two or more imaging
modalities in order to overcome the shortcomings of single modality
systems for optimal visualization and better quantitative delineation
of targets of interest. Consequently, multimodal imaging techniques
have become the norm in both clinical practice and preclinical research
as evidenced by the implementation of PET/CT (PET: positron emission
tomography; CT: computed tomography) and PET/MRI (MRI: magnetic resonance
imaging) procedures to patient care and the increasing use of a variety
of combinations of the currently available imaging techniques in translational
or basic biomedical research, such as MRI/optical and PET/NIRF (NIRF:
near-infrared fluorescence).− The fusion of PET and MRI is especially desirable because technically
their physical features are complementary. While radionuclide-based
imaging techniques, either PET or SPECT (single photon emission computed
tomography), are extremely sensitive and quantitative, which allows
the studies of biological events or processes at the molecular and
cellular level, their spatial resolution is limited (&gt;1 cm for
current
clinical scanners).− On the other hand, while MRI is able to provide high
spatial resolution (&lt;0.1 cm) with exquisite soft tissue contrast
even without exogenous contrast agents, contrast agents are often
required to highlight specific biological or physiological processes
in an amount a few orders of magnitude higher than PET or SPECT.−

Given that more and more PET/MRI systems will likely be used
in
the practice of diagnostic radiology, it becomes important to develop
dual modality imaging probes that can realize the full potential of
both modalities.

To take advantage of the strengths of PET and
MRI, our approach
is to design and synthesize a dual-modality agent scaffold offering
a “single pharmacological behavior” for both imaging
acquisitions. The merging of PET and MRI probe moieties to a single
molecular platform would facilitate colocation and cross-validation
of each modality in targeted regions of interest (two measures of
one event). While MRI can provide the exact location of the probe,
motion artifact correction, and PET partial volume correction, PET
can afford better imaging quantification for higher detection sensitivity.
Further, given that the proton MRI contrast actually reflects the
map of the proton density, a colocalized PET signal distinct from
the proton background could make the MRI contrast more identifiable,
which further improves the MRI sensitivity.

Indeed several nanoparticle-based
PET/MRI agents have been reported
with enhanced magnetic relaxivities and considerable promise as dual-modality
imaging agents.− However, a nanoparticle platform for PET/MRI probe
development presents challenges. First, the nanoparticle-based PET/MRI
probes are not single molecular entities and often have questionable
in vivo stability or molecular integrity. Second, to serve the purpose
of diagnostic imaging, contrast agents are desired to have a reasonable
blood circulation half-life for efficient accumulation in targets
and minimal nonspecific deposition in the mononuclear phagocyte system
(MPS) organs after systemic administration. However, it is well-known
that most nanoparticles if not all possess suboptimal in vivo distribution
as shown by rapid sequestration into MPS organs and thereafter slow
clearance. These properties present potential health hazards− which could impede their translation toward clinical applications.
Third, the majority of nanoparticle-based PET/MRI agents provide T2 contrast; only a handful are T1-based agents, which are preferred in the cases of low
proton density in the target tissues. To date, a wide range of macromolecules,
such as perfluorocarbon emulsions, silica
nanoparticles,,, liposomal vesicles,,− dendrimers,− and polymers, have been explored for
the development of gadolinium-based T1 contrast agents. Of the macromolecular systems, dendrimers, which
possess definitive molecular structures and formula, have shown a
promising role. For instance, the dendrimer systems of poly(amido
amine) (PAMAM) have been used as blood pool, liver, renal, lymphatic, and tumor-specific contrast agents. However, the Gd-PAMAM complexes
rarely afford an ionic relaxivity greater than 11 mM–1 s–1 per gadolinium ion., When such dendrimer platforms are used to develop PET/MRI or SPECT/MRI
agents, it is challenging to achieve precise control of radioisotope
loading into specific chelating moieties. Herein, we present a dual-modality
molecular probe design (Figure ) carrying
six 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)
moieties branched out from a single 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N′,N″-triacetic acid (NOTA)
core structure. In this work, we demonstrate an exclusive loading
of Gd3+ into the DOTA units affording a T1 ion relaxivity of 15.99 mM–1 s–1 at 20 MHz, while the NOTA core remains available
to form a chelate with 67/68Ga3+ for nuclear
imaging. If the targeted accumulation event is rapid, 68Ga (t1/2 = 68 min; β+ = 89%, Eβ+max = 1.92 MeV; EC =
11%) will be used for PET imaging; otherwise, 67Ga (t1/2 = 3.26 d; γ = 184 keV) will be used
for SPECT imaging.

Dual-modality molecular probe design.

Results and Discussion
The dual-modality molecular probe
design also possesses three amino
groups for potential conjugation with multiple copies of targeting
molecules, thereby providing multivalent effect to the construct for
better specific binding to the biological target of interest. Of note,
the strong interaction between the targeting molecule tethered probe
and the corresponding target, triggered by multivalent effect, is
expected to further enhance the relaxivity of the probe. For proof
of concept, we conjugated each amine with a model integrin αvβ3 targeting peptide, c(RGDyK). The main
features of this molecular dual-modality imaging probe design include
the apparent in vivo stability (due to the inertness of the Gd-DOTA
and Ga-NOTA complexes) and the defined molecular formula with selective
loading of two metal ions.

Synthesis
The desired ligand H21L was synthesized in 7 steps with an overall
yield of approximately
15%. The structure of each intermediate was verified by 1H NMR and 13C NMR as well as mass spectroscopy. The synthesis
route to compound H21L is outlined in Scheme  and its functionalization is depicted in Scheme . Compound 2 was obtained from bis(3-aminopropyl)amine
and carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) protected lysine in three steps (see ). The free primary amine
of 2 was coupled to the carboxylic acid bearing side
arms of NOTA-(OH)3 (Scheme ) via
carbodiimide chemistry to form 3. The N-phthaloyl protected amino groups of 3 were freed by
deprotection via hydrazine to afford 4, which contains
six amino groups serving as points of attachment for the DOTA units.

Synthetic Route to Ligand H21L
The N-hydroxy succinamide activated DOTA ester, 5, was reacted
to the six amino groups forming 6. Attempts to deprotect
the Boc groups of compound 6 led to partial deprotection
of the Cbz groups. To overcome this
problem, the ligand was fully deprotected by 30% HBr in an acetic
acid solution. The synthesized ligand, H21L, was fully characterized. The ligand carries six DOTA units intended
for chelating Gd3+ and one NOTA unit intended for chelating
Ga3+. Since Gd3+ and Ga3+ can be
specifically loaded into the DOTA and NOTA moieties, respectively,
based on their ion-size preference, the bimetallic molecular complex
is expected to carry the two metal ions in a specified ratio so as
to facilitate PET imaging based quantification.

Functionalization
of ligand H21L was performed
by utilizing the previously mentioned amino groups. Maleimido groups
were tethered to amines using the commercially available reagent of N-succinimidyl 3-maleimidopropionate (Scheme ). The model targeting peptide, c(RGDyK), was tethered to
the maleimido carrying ligand H21L via thiol–maleimide
coupling. Given that targeting molecules attached to the bimetallic
complex may not be able to stretch out for specific binding because
of the steric hindrance from the construct, additionally we introduced
a PEG12 linker between the complex and targeting vector.

Synthesis of Integrin αvβ3 Targeted
Ligand Scaffolds
The thiol group without a spacer (zero) or with a PEG12 linker was introduced to c(RGDyK) using the commercially
available
reagent: 2-pyridyldithiol-tetraoxaoctatriacontane-N-hydroxysuccinimide (SPDP). The thiol terminated c(RGDyK) peptides
with zero and PEG12 linker were subsequently added to H21L(Mal)3 to afford Gd6H3L[c(RGDyK)]3 and Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3, respectively.

Complexation with Gd3+ and Ga3+ to form
Gd6LGa
The thermodynamic stability
constants of Gd-DOTA (log KGd-DOTA = 24.7), Gd-NOTA
(log KGd-NOTA = 14.3), and Ga-NOTA (log KGa-NOTA = 31.0), suggest that when ligand H21L is treated with 6 equiv of Gd3+, its complex
can be formed exclusively with the DOTA units. The bimetallic complex
of H21L, Gd6LGa, can
then be formed by incorporation of Ga3+ into the NOTA core.
However, considering that the reaction of L with the
stoichiometric amount of Gd3+ may be slow and could lead
to partial complexation of the DOTA units, the first complexation
was performed with excess of Gd3+ to give complete chelation
of both the DOTA and NOTA units forming Gd7L. This was confirmed with mass spectroscopy (see ) as well as 1H NMR spectra
using Eu3+ instead of Gd3+. Later, Gd3+ was efficiently removed from the NOTA core by treating the complex
with excess diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) (the log K
of Gd-DTPA42 is approximately 8 orders of magnitude higher
than that of Gd-NOTA). The incorporation of either cold Ga3+ or 68Ga3+ into the NOTA core of complex of
Gd6H3L was then carried out at
pH 3–5 in an HEPES buffer. The cold Gd6LGa complex was purified and characterized by HPLC and mass spectrometry.
Various concentration of Gd6LGa were injected
to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-mass) and the
ratio of Gd:Ga was calculated to be 6:1 (see ). The Gd6L68Ga was purified and characterized by radio-HPLC using the cold complex
as reference.

Coordination Chemistry of the NOTA Core of
H21L
To prove the efficient removal
of Gd3+ from the NOTA core during the complexation procedure,
the same complexation
procedure was followed using Eu3+ instead of Gd3+. Chemically, Eu3+ and Gd3+ have similar reactivities
toward NOTA and DOTA. Since Eu3+ is only weakly paramagnetic,
the 1H NMR signals of its complexes are relatively sharp
and also paramagnetically shifted. This facilitates relatively straightforward
structural characterization by NMR spectroscopy. To accomplish this,
the Eu3+ complex of H21L, were
synthesized via two procedures, i.e., with and without a challenge
by excess DTPA, followed by HPLC purification. Both complexes were
characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy (400 MHz). Figure a,b shows the 1H NMR spectra of Eu3+ complexes of H21L with and without
the DTPA challenge, respectively. The DTPA treated Eu3+ complex (Figure a) showed sharp peaks in
the NOTA region (around 3–4 ppm) suggesting a metal free NOTA
core as opposed to the untreated complex (Figure b), which showed broad peaks indicating the interaction of
metal with the NOTA core. This characterization along with the mass
spectroscopy results of Gd7L and Gd6H3L indicates the exclusive Gd3+ coordination with the six DOTA moieties of H21L. Further, the formation of Gd6LGa was confirmed by the
molar ratio of Gd:Ga determined by ICP-mass (). These results demonstrate that Gd3+ and Ga3+ have been exclusively loaded to the DOTA and
NOTA moieties as designed, respectively, for the preparation of the
desired dual-modality molecular imaging probe.

Relaxometric Measurements
The T1 relaxivity of Gd6LGa was measured
at 20 MHz, 25 °C, to be 95.98 mM–1 s–1 with R2 value greater than 0.99 (each
Gd3+ in the complex accounted for 15.99 mM–1 s–1 (ion relaxivity)). Under the same conditions,
the relaxivity of Magnavist was found to be 4.1 mM–1 s–1. Impressively, the T1 relaxivity of Gd6H3L was
approximately 4 times higher than that of the Gd-DOTA complex and
comparable to the Gd-PAMAM complexes, which have been reported with
the ion relaxivity up to 11 mM–1 s–1., It is noteworthy that a similar relaxivity
was also reported for a polylysine-based contrast agent (MW 17 453)
with 24 Gd-DOTA units., At the physiological temperature
of 37 °C, the relaxivity of Gd6LGa was
unchanged while its relaxivity in rat serum at 25 °C increased
to 153.1 mM–1 s–1. These observations
suggest two things: first, the lack of temperature dependence between
25 and 37 °C suggests that the water exchange rate in the appended
Gd-DO3A-monoamide complexes limits the relaxivity somewhat at 25 °C.
Given that water exchange is faster at 37 °C, the expected decline
in relaxivity with increasing temperatures is offset by faster water
exchange and a more favorable relaxivity at 37 °C. This was an
unanticipated yet welcomed added advantage for this probe platform
design. The higher relaxivity in serum indicates that Gd6LGa does interact with one or more serum proteins.

MR Imaging and Relaxivity Measurements of Gd6LGa at 1.0 T
The MR imaging potential of Gd6LGa was evaluated at magnetic field of 1.0 T. Figure  shows the T1 weighted
imaging of Gd6LGa in comparison with Magnevist
at a series of decreasing concentrations (0.4–0.02 mM determined
by ICP-mass). The images of Gd6LGa were obviously
brighter than those of Magnevist (4.1 mM–1 s–1) at each equivalent concentration. The T1 relaxivity of Gd6LGa was measured
at 113.36 mM–1 s–1 (T1 ion relaxivity: 18.89 mM–1 s–1) at 1.0 T (25 °C). Since the agent is intended for conjugation
to a targeting moiety for receptor-based imaging, such interactions
could further enhance the relaxivity of the agent in vivo.

In Vivo Tissue Distribution,
Pharmacokinetics, and Stability
of Gd6LGa
As compared to other nanoparticle-based
dual modality imaging platforms, our molecular probe design is expected
to have a reasonable blood circulation half-life and an efficient
clearance profile from the organs. To evaluate the in vivo behavior
of this probe design, Gd6LH3 was
radiolabeled with 67Ga (t1/2 = 3.26 d) so that the tissue biodistribution could be evaluated
over an extended period. As shown in Table , the bimetallic complex, Gd6L67Ga, indeed displayed a rapid and efficient clearance profile from
all major organs except kidneys in normal mice. The high renal uptake
can be attributed to the net positive charge on the probe due to the
presence of amine groups. However, an
efficient renal clearance is obvious after the initial high uptake
as seen from the decrease of the kidney uptake level from 101.0 ±
4.3%ID/g at 1 h p.i. to 43.0 ± 5.1%ID/g at 24 h p.i. One would
anticipate that kidney clearance would be even faster once the positively
charged amino groups are removed from the agent through conjugation
with a targeting vector. Indeed, when the amine groups of the agent
were capped with c(RGDyK), the kidney uptake was impressively reduced
to ca. 3%ID/g at 2 h p.i.

The pharmacokinetics of Gd6L67Ga showed a two-compartment profile with t1/2α = 11.3 min and t1/2β = 7.3 h, quite different compared to nanoparticle-based
imaging agents which can be described by one-compartment models., The t1/2α reveals that the tissue
distribution of Gd6L67Ga was relatively
rapid while the reasonably long t1/2β enables the probe to accumulate in its targeted tissues without
incurring high background uptake. This indicates that the probe behaves
similarly to other clinically available small molecule contrast agents. The presence of amine groups on the ligand provides
the ease of incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains into
the probe for optimization of the in vivo kinetics if necessary.

The in vitro and in vivo stabilities of Gd6L67Ga were evaluated through incubation in rat serum and
by mouse urine metabolite analysis, respectively. The bimetallic complex
remained intact during the entire course of study, which further validates
this molecular probe platform design.

Receptor-Binding
Assay of Targeted Gd6LGa Complexes
Two integrin αvβ3 targeted Gd6LGa complexes Gd6H3L[c(RGDyK)]3 and Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3) were prepared to
validate that our molecular construct design
can be utilized for specific imaging of cancer biomarkers. The αvβ3-binding affinities were determined by
a competitive cell-binding assay using 125I-echistatin
(PerkinElmer) as the αvβ3-specific
radioligand. The best-fit IC50 values (inhibitory concentration
where 50% of the 125I-echistatin bound on U87MG cells are
displaced) of c(RGDyK), Gd6H3L[c(RGDyK)]3, and Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3) were measured to be 199 nM, 489 nM, and 37
nM (), respectively.
The significantly improved αvβ3 binding
affinity of Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3) clearly indicates the critical role of the
PEG12 linker in the desired targeting property of our molecular
scaffold design.

PET/MR Imaging Using Gd6L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]368Ga
To overcome the sensitivity
difference between PET and MR, the radioactivity of 68Ga
was controlled in the labeling of Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3. The final dose injected
into each animal carried about 6.0 mg of the final compound with an
activity of 100–150 μCi (Gd: ca. 0.027 mmol/kg; c(RGDyK):
2.0 μmol). Figure  shows in vivo dual
PET/MR images of integrin ανβ3 positive U87MG tumor enabled by a single dose injection of Gd6L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]368Ga. The average tumor uptake measured by PET was 0.88%ID/g. It should
be noted that the tumor uptake value was reduced by roughly 3 times
when the injected amount of the agent increased from 0.1 mg to 6.0
mg. This decrease also indicates the integrin ανβ3 imaging specificity. The observed MR contrast
enhancement in the tumor was 3.06 (n = 3) when compared
to the contrast before injection.

To date, few PET/MRI or SPECT/MRI
agents with a defined structure have been reported. In vivo pH monitoring
PET/MRI agents carrying one Gd-DOTA unit along with 18F
or 68Ga as PET contrast have been reported. Bimetallic complexes carrying one Gd-DOTA conjugated
to 68Ga-NOTA and one Gd-DOTA conjugated to cold Cu or In-DOTA
do exist., However, they were not designed to serve
the goal of providing targeted contrast to both imaging techniques.
To provide proof of concept, the probe design in this work consists
of only six gadolinium chelatable DOTA units. While the anticipated T1 relaxivity enhancement was achieved, we recognize
that further amplification of MRI sensitivity is necessary in order
to realize the practical application of the molecular probe design
as dual-modality imaging agents. Given the versatility of the design
concept, we believe that it can be readily modified or adapted to
reach the desired MRI sensitivity.

In conclusion, we have successfully
demonstrated a molecular platform
intended for targeted dual-modality imaging of PET/MRI or SPECT/MRI,
which carries quantifiable numbers of 67/68Ga3+ and Gd3+ ions in their specific chelation moieties. This
probe design displays a very favorable high T1 relaxivity for MRI contrast enhancement. With the current
rapid growth of hybrid PET/MRI systems in diagnostic radiology, our
molecular design of dual-modality agents possessing a “single
pharmacological behavior” offers a versatile platform for the
development of multimodality imaging agents with potential applications
for noninvasive molecular profiling of various diseases.

Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetics Studies
of Gd6L67Ga
Male BALB/C
mice were injected
with 300 μCi of Gd6L67Ga
complex to evaluate the tissue distribution of the tracer in mice.
Mice were sacrificed 1, 4, and 24 h post injection (p.i.). The organs
of interest (blood, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, stomach, muscle,
fat, small intestine, large intestine, and brain) were harvested and
weighed, and radioactivity was quantified using a γ-counter.
Standards were prepared and counted along with the tissue samples
to calculate the percentage-injected dose per gram (%ID/g). To determine
the pharmacokinetic parameters, mice injected with the tracer were
blood sampled from the retro-orbital sinus at 2, 5, 10, and 30 min,
and 1, 2, 24, and 48 h p.i. and quantified using a γ-counter.
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated based on a two-compartment
open model.

evaluation, each male mouse was injected with 600 μCi of Gd6L67Ga complex in 100 μL of saline
via the tail vein. The urine samples were collected at 1, 4, 24, and
48 h p.i. and then analyzed by HPLC.

Integrin αvβ3 Receptor-Binding
Assay
The integrin αvβ3 binding affinities of c(RGDyK), Gd6H3L[c(RGDyK)]3, and Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3 were determined by
a competitive cell-binding assay using 125I-echistatin
(PerkinElmer) as the αvβ3-specific
radioligand. The experiments were performed on U87MG human glioblastoma
cells following a previously reported method. Briefly, U87MG cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS)
at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Suspended U87MG cells in the
binding buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.0 mM CaCl2, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM MnCl2, 0.1% bovine serum
albumin) were seeded on multiwell DV plates (Millipore) with 5 ×
104 cells per well and then incubated with 125I-echistatin (10 000 cpm/well) in the presence of increasing
concentrations (0–5000 nM) of each c(RGDyK) peptide conjugate
for 2 h. The final volume in each well was maintained at 200 μL.
At the end of incubation, unbound 125I-echistatin was removed
by filtration followed by three rinses with cold binding buffer. The
retentate was collected and the radioactivity was measured using a
γ-counter. The best-fit IC50 values (inhibitory concentration
where 50% of the 125I-echistatin bound on U87MG cells are
displaced) of c(RGDyK), Gd6H3L[c(RGDyK)]3, and Gd6H3L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]3 were calculated by fitting the data with nonlinear
regression using GraphPad Prism (GraphPadSoftware, Inc.). Experiments
were repeated with quintuplicate samples.

Relaxivity Measurements
at 0.5 T (T)
The T1 values were
recorded at 23 MHz (0.5 T) at 25 °C
by using a Maran Ultra relaxometer (Oxford Instruments, UK). Longitudinal
relaxation times were measured by using the inversion–recovery
pulse sequence (180°-t-90°). The T1 relaxivities were determined by the linear regression analysis
of the water proton relaxation rates in solutions ranging in concentration
from 0.005 to 12.0 mM, in Millipore water in triplicate.

MRI Imaging
and Relaxivity Measurements at 1.0 T
The T1-weighted MR images of samples in 0.5 mL microfuge
tubes were collected using Aspect Imaging M2TM 1.0 T (43.5–45
MHz, 60 mm diameter volume coil) Gradient Echo Spoiled External Averaging
(GRE-EXT) sequence. For imaging, the following parameters were used:
TR = 14.2 ms; effective echo time (TE) = 2.8 ms; FOV 64 × 100
mm2, data matrix = 256 × 256, averaging = 4, slice = 1 mm. The T1-maps of the samples at 1.0 T were determined
from a series of multi-T1 (0.01 ms to
5 s) inversion recovery spin echo sequence (IR-SE with minimum TE
= 7.0 ms); TR = 10 s; FOV = 64 × 100 mm2; matrix =
128 × 128; averaging = 1, steady state scans = 10), fitted and
calculated using Matlab code. All the fits for T1 values used to calculate the longitudinal relaxivity, r1, had fitting coefficients, R2 ≥ 0.99. Three trials were performed. The Gd and
Ga metal concentrations of samples were determined by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

PET/MR Imaging Using Gd6L[PEG12c(RGDyK)]368Ga
The MR and PET imaging
studies were performed on a 1.0 T MR scanner (Aspect Imaging, Shoham,
Israel) using a 35 mm mouse body coil, and a Siemens Inveon Multimodality
PET/CT system (Siemens Medical Solutions Inc., Knoxville, TN, USA),
respectively. Ten minutes prior to imaging, the animals were anesthetized
using 3% isofluorane at room temperature until stable vitals were
established. Once the animals were sedated, they were placed onto
a custom-made interchangeable bed between the MR and PET scanners
under 2% isofluorane anesthesia for the duration of the imaging. A T1-weighted gradient echo, spoiled sequence (echo
time/repetition time [TE/TR] 3/15 ms; field of view [FOV] 80 ×
100 mm; slice thickness 0.8 mm; matrix 256 × 256; number of excitations
[NEX] = 3; flip angle = 25°) was performed for each mouse. Each
mouse was injected with 100–150 μCi (Gd: ca. 0.027 mmol/kg)
via the tail-vein. MR scans were obtained precontrast and 1 h after
contrast medium injection.

PET imaging was acquired with the
mouse mounted on the interchangeable bed directly following the MR
acquisition. A 15 min PET static scan was performed and reconstructed
using Fourier rebinning and ordered subsets expectation maximization
3D (OSEM3D) algorithm. Reconstructed MR and PET images were fused
and analyzed using the VivoQuant software (Invicro LLC, Boston, USA).
For quantification, regions of interest were placed on the tumor and
muscle. The latter was used for normalization. The resulting quantitative
data were expressed in intensity and %ID/g for MR and PET images.
