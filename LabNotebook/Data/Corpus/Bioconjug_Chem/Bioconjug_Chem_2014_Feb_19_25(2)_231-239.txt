Introduction
Atherosclerosis,
a chronic inflammatory vascular disease, is a
high-risk factor for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events.
Enlarged plaque lesions constrict the luminal surface of the artery
and hence reduce blood flow., Therefore, molecular
imaging to monitor the progression of atherosclerosis can improve
the management of patients and facilitate diagnosis., Imaging modalities such as ultrasound,, computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),, and positron emission tomography (PET), have been exploited to visualize molecular changes in addition to
anatomical structure.− To obtain a molecular readout of the lesion formation,
PET is attractive due to the high sensitivity and the feasibility
of dynamic studies. PET combined with MRI or CT is advantageous in
cardiovascular imaging, as together they provide simultaneous images
of molecular and anatomical information,, potentially improving diagnosis and patient management.

The
formation of atherosclerotic plaque is associated with a complex
biological progression which includes the production of multiple biomarkers., Plaque macrophages and endothelial cells are considered to be the
main targets for the noninvasive identification of atherosclerosis
progression,− with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) identified as a
particularly important marker of early disease. [18F]FDG,
which accumulates in macrophages, has been applied to image inflammation
associated with early atherosclerosis;,, however, improvements in selective imaging of plaque
are required to reduce the endogenous background. Recently, 64Cu-TNP (trireporter nanoparticles),
which are dextran-coated nanoparticles including a near-infrared fluorochrome
and 64Cu, were specifically visualized on macrophages in
inflammatory atherosclerosis and showed higher standard uptake values
(SUV) than obtained with [18F]FDG.

LyP-1 (CGNKRTRGC), a cyclic peptide, recognizes tumor cells
and
macrophages by binding to the p32 protein on the cell surface., Further, LyP-Hsp, a bioengineered protein cage expressing LyP-1,
exhibited enhanced macrophage targeting. Recently, Hamzah et al. demonstrated that LyP-1 is a promising peptide
for targeting p32 that is overexpressed on plaque-associated macrophages. In this study, F-18-labeled monomeric Lyp-1
selectively bound to atherosclerotic plaques and facilitated visualization
of plaque with PET; however, the binding affinity (Kd = 3 μmol/L) of LyP-1 resulted in a relatively
low accumulation (0.3%ID/g) in the aorta., To address this issue, we designed and synthesized a dendrimer with
multiple LyP-1 ligands on one scaffold, in a manner similar to other
dendrimeric studies. Multivalent dendrimers
have been applied to increase the binding avidity of various targeting
ligands.− Previously, tetrameric or pentameric dendrimers showed
4- to 300-fold greater avidity than monovalent peptides.,,, The enhanced avidity of such dendrimers has the potential to improve
molecular imaging of atherosclerotic lesions.

Here, we designed
and synthesized LyP-1 and control (ARALPSQRSR)
dendrimers (Figure ). Building blocks (peptides
and core dendrimers including FAM (carboxyfluor-escein or fluorescein
amidite) or 6-BAT) were built on solid phase. Ammonium acetate catalyzed
the hydrazone formation of peptides and dendrimers and produced the
peptide-conjugated dendrimers, which facilitated fluorescent and PET-CT
imaging of atherosclerotic plaque. Until now, quantitative studies
of atherosclerotic plaque via p32 on macrophages have not been explored;
therefore, here we evaluated the application of 64Cu- and
FAM-labeled dendrimers to image atherosclerotic plaque with PET-CT
and fluorescence images.

Materials and Methods
General
Information and Materials
All Fmoc-amino acids, O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU),
piperidine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide
(DIC), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and Rink amide MBHA resin (0.52
mmol/g) were purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA) and AAPPTec
(Louisville, KY). All other chemical reagents were obtained from commercial
suppliers and used without further purification. Reversed-phase HPLC
was performed on a Varian ProStar HPLC system with 220 and 254 nm
UV detection, using a Microsorb C-12 semipreparative column (10 ×
250 mm) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min, or a preparative column (25 ×
250 mm) at a flow rate 13.5 mL/min. All runs used linear gradients
of 5–30% buffer B in A (A: water containing 0.05% TFA, B: acetonitrile
containing 0.05% TFA) over 40 min. Matrix assisted laser desorption
ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS)
were performed at the Campus Mass Spectrometry Facilities in the University
of California, Davis. CuCl2 was purchased from MIR Radiological
Science at Washington University under a protocol controlled by the
University of California, Davis. Schemes of the peptide building block
synthesis are in the  (SI-1).

Peptide Synthesis
The peptides [Lev-amido-dPEG4-LyP-1 (LyP-1: C(S–S)GNKRTRGC-NH2)] (1), [Lev-amido-dPEG4-ARAL (ARAL: ARALPSQRSR-NH2)] (2), FAM-dPEG4-LyP-1 and FAM-dPEG4-ARAL were prepared using standard Fmoc mediated solid-phase
peptide synthesis on Rink amide MBHA resin (100 mg) using HATU (3
equiv) and DIPEA (6 equiv). All amino acids, N-Fmoc-amido-dPEG4 acid and levulinic acid (Lev) were coupled with coupling
reagents at room temperature for 45 min each. The carboxyfluorescein
(10 equiv) was coupled with DIC (10 equiv, HOBt, 10 equiv) in DMF
at room temperature overnight. For the disulfide bond, cyclization
of LyP-1 was performed on resin with iodine (10 equiv) in DMF for
4 h before the coupling of the hydrophilic linker (N-Fmoc-amido-dPEG4 acid). The resin was washed with DMF (2 ×
5 mL) and then three times with a copious volume of CH2Cl2, filtered, and dried in a vacuum. The resin was suspended
in a mixture of TFA-H2O-TIPS (95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v, total
volume 5.0 mL) for 2.5 h. The peptide was purified on high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) using 5–30% acetonitrile in water
and 0.05% TFA, giving 35% yield from the crude peptide cleaved off
from the resin. The correct purified product was confirmed by matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization (MALDI) under reflective mode or electron
spray ionization (ESI): Lev-Amido-dPEG4-LyP-1 (1): [M+H, C52H94N19O18S2] calculated monoisotopic mass 1336.64, measured mass

mL) and the N-terminal Fmoc groups were deprotected with 20% piperidine–DMF
(v/v) and washed with DMF (3 × 3 mL), MeOH (2 × 3 mL) and
DCM (2 × 3 mL). Boc-aminooxy acetic acid (123 mg, 0.64 mmol,
12.0 equiv), HATU (237 mg, 0.64 mmol, 12.0 equiv) and 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine
(110 μL, 0.83 mmol, 16.0 equiv) were added to the resin and
the reaction mixture was agitated for 90 min. The resin was washed
with DMF (3 × 3 mL) and then three times with a copious volume

resin was suspended in a mixture of TFA-H2O-TIPS (95: 2.5:2.5,
v/v/v, total volume 3.0 mL) for 2.5 h and filtered to remove the resin.
The cleavage cocktail was removed with a stream of N2 and
the crude product was precipitated with hexane:diethyl ether (1:1,
v/v, 10 mL). The solvent was evaporated and the solid obtained was
briefly dried in vacuum. The dendrimer was obtained after semipreparative
HPLC and lyophilization. The product was confirmed by MALDI under
reflective mode: dendrimer [M+H, C53H101N16O24S] calculated monoisotopic mass 1377.69, measured

6-BAT(6-[p-(bromoacetamido)benzyl]-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-N,N″,N‴,N′′′′-tetraacetic acid, 4.7 mg, 7.2 μmol) was attached to
the dendrimer (10 mg, 7.2 μmol) via free thiol groups of C-terminal
cysteine in 0.1 M ammonium acetate (pH 8.0) at room temperature for
6 h. The solution was lyophilized to obtain the solid. The dendrimer-6-BAT

HPLC using a gradient of acetonitrile in water (both containing 0.1%
TFA) and lyophylization. The correct purified product was confirmed
by MALDI under reflective mode: [M+H, C80H140N21O33S] where the calculated monoisotopic
mass was 1954.96, measured mass 1955.3.

Synthesis of Dendrimer-FAM
The resin (52 μmol,
1.0 equiv) was swollen in DMF in the peptide synthesizer reaction
vessel for 1 h, followed by Fmoc deprotection, and washed with DMF
(3 × 3 mL), MeOH (2 × 3 mL) and DCM (2 × 3 mL). Fmoc-Lys(Mmt)-OH
(100.0 mg, 0.156 mmol, 3.0 equiv), HATU (59.3 mg, 0.16 mmol, 3.0 equiv)
and DIPEA (54.3 μL, 0.31 mmol, 6.0 equiv) were added to the
resin and the reaction mixture was agitated for 45 min at room temperature.
The resin was washed with DMF (3 × 3 mL) and Fmoc removal was
achieved by piperidine (20% v/v) in DMF (2 × 3 min) and washed
with DMF (3 × 3 mL), MeOH (2 × 3 mL) and DCM (2 × 3
mL). The following reactions were performed as described above until
the deprotection of Mmt was achieved. The N-terminal Mmt groups were
deprotected in a mixture of AcOH-TFE-DCM (1:2:7, v/v/v, 5 mL) and
washed with DMF (3 × 3 mL), MeOH (2 × 3 mL) and DCM (2 ×
3 mL). The 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (58.7 mg, 0.156 mmol, 3.0 equiv),
HATU (59.3 mg, 0.16 mmol, 3.0 equiv) and DIPEA (54.3 μL, 0.31
mmol, 6.0 equiv) dissolved in DMF were added to the resin and the
reaction mixture was agitated for 10 h. The resin was washed with
DMF (3 × 3 mL) and then three times with a copious volume of
CH2Cl2, filtered, and dried in vacuum. The resulting
material was suspended in a mixture of TFA-H2O-TIPS (95:
2.5:2.5, v/v/v, total volume 3.0 mL) for 2.5 h and filtered to remove
the resin. The cleavage cocktail was removed with a stream of N2 and the crude product was precipitated with hexane:diethyl
ether (1:1, v/v, 10 mL). The solvent was evaporated and the solid
obtained was briefly dried in vacuum. Dendrimers were obtained after
semipreparative HPLC using a gradient of acetonitrile in water (both
containing 0.1% TFA) and lyophilization. The product was confirmed
by MALDI under reflective mode: dendrimer-FAM (4): [M+H,
C77H118N17O30] calculated
monoisotopic mass 1760.82, measured mass 1760.6.

Synthesis of
Peptide-Dendrimers via Oxime Ligation
Six equivalents of
the levulinic acid-functionalized peptides were
incubated overnight with 1 equiv of dendrimer-6-BAT or dendrimer-FAM
(2–7 μmol scale) in 100 mM anilinium acetate (pH 4.5).
The products were purified by semipreparative HPLC using a gradient
of acetonitrile in water (both containing 0.1% TFA) and lyophilization.
The isolated yield was 57 ± 9%. The product confirmed by MALDI
under linear mode: (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-6-BAT (5): [M+H, C288H504N97O101S9] calculated mass 7230.28, measured mass 7237.7, (ARAL)4-dendrimer-6-BAT (6): [M+H, C328H580N109O109S] calculated mass 7826.87,

7632.56, measured mass 7642.5.

Preparation of 64Cu-Labeled LyP-1- and ARAL-Dendrimers
All labeling procedures
were controlled under a protocol of the
University of California, Davis. To a solution of 64CuCl2 buffered with 0.1 M ammonium citrate (pH 5.5, 0.2 mL), we
added 1 mM (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-6-BAT
(2–4 μmol) in double distilled water with a 37 MBq/nmol
concentration. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and
the reaction completion was monitored by radio-TLC. The reaction mixture
was diluted with double distilled water (6 mL) and the pH was adjusted
to 7 with 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The solution was drawn into
the syringe and was passed dropwise through the preactivated light
Sep-Pack C18 plus light cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The cartridge
was washed with double distilled water (10 mL × 2) dropwise.
The product trapped on a C18 cartridge was recovered by a releasing
solution (&lt;0.7 mL of 1% AcOH, 80% EtOH, 19%H2O, volume
%). The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen at 60 °C until
dry (&lt;30 min). After assessing the dryness of the compound, the
isolated dendrimer was resuspended in PBS. The radiochemical purity
was determined by radio-TLC and HPLC ().

Saturation Binding Assay
LyP-1-dendrimer binding affinity
(Kd) to p32 protein was quantified by
a sandwich ELISA-based assay. 96 well plates (Costar EIA/RIA 1 ×
8 Stripwell plate, Corning Inc., NY) with 5 μg/mL of p32 protein
(R&amp;D systems, MN) were incubated with varied concentrations (1
μM – 1 nM) of (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu (100 μL in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing
with 0.05 wt % Tween 10 in PBS, the radioactivity of each well was
counted on a gamma counter (Perkin-ElmerLife Sciences). Nonspecific
binding of the LyP-1-dendrimer was measured by spiking 0.1 mM nonlabeled
(LyP-1)4-dendrimer-6-BAT in various concentrations of (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu. Experiments were duplicated and
the Kd value was calculated by Prism ().

In Vivo Imaging and Biodistribution Studies
All animal
experiments were conducted under a protocol approved by the University
of California, Davis, Animal Use and Care Committee (Davis, CA). ApoE-null
mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) with atherosclerotic
plaques were induced by maintenance on a high fat diet for 6 months
and were supplied to us by the University of California, Santa Barbara.
A total of n = 22 mice were studied, where 16 mice
were injected with the (Lyp-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu (n = 9) and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu (n = 7) for both PET imaging and biodistribution
and 6 mice were injected with (Lyp-1)4-dendrimer-FAM (n = 2), Lyp-1-FAM (n = 2) and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-FAM (n = 2) for optical imaging.
All imaging was conducted under 1.5% isoflurane.

PET-CT Imaging
and Biodistribution
For the PET-CT study, 64Cu-dendrimers
were administered to ApoE–/– mice through
the tail vein and images were acquired at 2 h after
injection. For studies involving biodistribution after intravenous
(IV) injection, ApoE–/– mice received 6.6
± 1.3 MBq of the (Lyp-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu
(n = 6) or 7.1 ± 1.7 MBq of the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu (n = 4). The average
mass of the LyP-1 and ARAL-dendrimer injected was 2.7 ± 1.3 μg
(n = 9) and 2.6 ± 1.3 μg (n = 8), respectively. For studies in which the mice received the dose
subcutaneously, 15.1 ± 3.1 MBq (n = 3) of the
(Lyp-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu and 10.6 ± 6.2
MBq (n = 3) of (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu were administered and the mice were euthanized at 24 h
after injection. At each time point, two mice were imaged simultaneously
for 20 min on the PET scanner (Focus 120, Siemens Medical Solutions,
Inc.). After data acquisition with PET, mice were carefully moved
to a commercially available micro CT scanner, MicroCAT II (Siemens,
Knoxville, TN) operated in high resolution mode with a 0.5 mm aluminum
filter. One hundred eighty projections were acquired during a full
rotation with the following scan parameters: 80 kVp, 425 μA,
240 ms per frame and 30 calibration images. The total scan time for
one bed position was 15 min. PET images were reconstructed using the
MAP algorithm with 1.5 mm spatial resolution. CT images were reconstructed
using the Feldkamp reconstruction algorithm as a 896 × 512 ×
1024 array with corresponding pixel size of 0.098 mm × 0.098
mm × 0.098 mm (x,y,z) with 43 μm spatial
resolution. PET and CT images were fused with AMIDE (AMIDE’s
Medical Image Data Examiner) using three fiducials placed on the bed.
The aortic root and aortic arch (Figure )
were identified by their relative position within the 3D data set
and relative image intensity. For the ex vivo PET study, the excised
aorta was placed on a polyacryl (50 mmID) transparent dish and was
covered with OCT to prevent dryness. Ex vivo PET images of the aorta
were acquired for 30 min. Image reconstruction followed the protocol
mentioned above.

Co-registered PET-CT images acquired after 2 h administration
of
(LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu (a and c, left column)
and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu (b and d, right column).
Red arrow indicates aortic root (AR) and descending aorta (DA).

To evaluate the pharmacokinetics
following subcutaneous injection
of the dendrimers, 64Cu-dendrimers were subcutaneously
injected in the loose skin of the neck of ApoE–/– mice (n = 3 for (Lyp-1)4-dendrimer, n = 3 for (ARAL)4-dendrimer). Image acquisition
was performed at 24 h for 20 min on Focus120 (Siemens Medical Solutions,
Inc.) and ex vivo PET imaging of the aorta followed the same procedure
as above.

The biodistribution was then acquired after the imaging
studies
described above. In each case, mice were euthanized with euthasol
(Western Medical Supply, Arcadia,CA) at 3 h. The blood was perfused
from the body with DMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Organs, including
the lymph nodes, aorta, heart, were then harvested and the biodistribution
and radioactivity were measured in a gamma counter (Perkin-ElmerLife
Sciences).

Ex Vivo Optical Imaging of the Aorta with
FAM Labeled Dendrimers
and LyP-1-FAM
(LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM, (ARAL)4-dendrimer-FAM and LyP-1-FAM were prepared as 1 μmol/mL
in PBS. Each 150 μL of solution was injected to ApoE–/– mice through the tail vein. After circulation for 1 h, blood was
perfused with saline and tissues were fresh frozen in OCT. Microscopic
optical images of the plaque in the aorta were acquired at randomly
selected locations. The detailed procedure followed previously reported
literature. For image analysis of accumulated
dendrimers in plaque, the TIFF images of the cross sectional area
of the aorta were processed in Image J (v 1.46r, NIH USA). Regions
of interest (ROI) were drawn over the composite image (RGB) between
endothelial and smooth muscle cells within the plaque. The green channel
was extracted from the image and the mean pixel intensity was calculated.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of LyP-1- and
ARAL-Dendrimer
l-Lysine,
a natural amino acid which has two primary reactive amines, has been
exploited as a branch unit for dendrimers, because of advantages including (1) the commercial availability
of orthogonally protected amines on the lysine which allow a selective
modification of α- and ε-amines, (2) the feasibility of
solid phase synthesis, and (3) the relatively low cytotoxicity as
a dendrimeric scaffold. We therefore
followed the building block approach illustrated in Figures  and  in which the peptide
and dendrimer were synthesized separately on resin and finally conjugated
in solution phase for the efficient synthesis of the peptide-conjugated
dendrimer.

Altogether, we designed four building blocks (Scheme  and Figure ); two are dendrimers
conjugated with 6-BAT and FAM for PET and optical studies, respectively,
and two include LyP-1 (1) and ARAL peptides (2, LyP-1 and the control peptide each have a +3 charge). Among possible
methods for orthogonal conjugation of the peptides and dendrimer,
including click reactions, thioether
methods,, and hydrazone formation, we followed oxime
ligation because oxime ligation has demonstrated successful conjugation
of ketone and aminooxy groups in an anilinium acetate buffer. First, monomethoxytrityl (Mmt) protected cysteine
(Fmoc-Cys(Mmt)-OH) or lysine (Fmoc-Lys(Mmt)-OH) was coupled on the
resin; Mmt was later deprotected before reacting with 6-BAT or carboxyfluorescein
(FAM). The dendritic scaffold was formed by two cycles of a coupling
reaction of Fmoc protected lysine. The four amine residues were then
extended with miniPEG (poly(ethylene glycol)) and Boc protected aminooxyacetic
acid. Cleavage of dendrimers followed by HPLC purification gave aminooxy
functionalized dendrimer-6-BAT and -FAM (Figure ).

Syntheses of LyP-1- and ARAL-Dendrimers from Building Blocks
Reagents, conditions and yield:
(a) anilinium acetate (0.1 M, pH 4.5), room temperature, overnight, 5 (45%), 6 (59%), 7 (63%), and 8 (63%).

For the solid phase synthesis
of Lev-amido-dPEG4-LyP-1
(1), Fmoc-NH-CGNKRTRGC was cyclized on a resin with iodine
before coupling with dPEG4 and levulinic acid. The linear
Lev-amido-dPEG4-ARAL was synthesized on a resin by routine
Fmoc chemistry. A PEG-spacer was placed between the levulinic acid
and peptides to reduce the steric hindrance of the cyclic peptide
and to increase the accessibility of ketone group in Lev to the aminooxy
group on the dendrimer. Overnight incubation of dendrimer-6-BAT (3) with 6 equiv of Lev-amido-dPEG4-LyP-1 (1) and Lev-amido-dPEG4-ARAL (2) in
anilinium acetate (0.1 M, pH 4.5) yielded the expected (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-6-BAT (5) and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-6-BAT
(6), respectively, which was confirmed by MALDI mass
spectroscopy (). For (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM (7) and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-FAM
(8), although HPLC purification showed one peak via the
UV detector, the MALDI spectrum from that fraction showed multiple
mass peaks of mono-, di, tri, and tetra-peptide conjugated dendrimers
().

Preparation
of (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-Dendrimer-64Cu
Several 64Cu chelators have been developed
to label larger molecules such as peptides, dendrimers, antibodies,
albumin, and nanoparticles. Here, we
used 6-BAT for PET imaging studies of the targeted dendrimer. Our
group previously demonstrated the feasibility of chelating 6-BAT with 64Cu in nanoparticles., The resulting radiolabeled
nanoparticle was stable in blood for more than 24 h, and therefore
this chelation approach was considered to be adequate for imaging
the pharmacokinetics of the lower molecular weight dendrimer (7–8
kDa) which is expected to have a short blood half-life. The selectivity
of 6-BAT for copper (as compared with other metal contaminants) facilitates
a high specific activity dendrimer.

Radiolabeling of both dendrimers with 64CuCl2 was performed in ∼37 MBq/nmol (64Cu/dendrimer)
due to the specific activity of 64Cu (55.5–740 MBq/nmol)., Incubation for one hour at 30 °C showed more than 94% incorporation
yield (n = 6) on radio-thin layer chromatography
(radio-TLC). The calculated specific activity of the (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu at the end of
the synthesis was 26.5 ± 4.7 (n = 3) and 26.3
± 5.8 MBq/nmol (n = 3), respectively. Decay
corrected radiochemical yield (n = 3) of the (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu was 80
± 5.7% and 78 ± 6.4%, respectively. The radiochemical purity
of the dendrimers was &gt;95% confirmed by radio-TLC and radio-HPLC
().

Saturation Binding Assay
of (LyP-1)4-Dendrimer-64Cu
Previously,
LyP-1 peptide showed a binding affinity
of 3 μM with p32 proteins. Here,
the saturation binding assay of (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu with p32 protein showed a binding affinity of Kd = 169 nM, which is 20-fold higher than the
LyP-1 peptide.

In Vivo PET-CT Imaging of Atherosclerotic
Plaque with (LyP-1)4-Dendrimer-64Cu and Biodistribution
Recently,
Nahrendorf et al. used PET-CT to show that dextran-coated superparamagenetic,
fluorescent, and 64Cu-labeled nanoparticles localized to
macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. However, the targeting mechanism was postulated to be the high inherent
phagocytic avidity. With the small dendrimeric structures used here,
phagocytic activity is expected to be reduced as compared with larger
nanotherapeutics.

Our previous plaque imaging approach involved
targeting p32 proteins on macrophages with the [18F]-FBA-LyP-1
peptide in ApoE–/– mice and visualizing the
anatomical location via PET. In the current
work, coregistered PET-CT images of ApoE–/– mice which received the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu showed a robust PET signal in the aortic root and descending aorta
(Figure a,c). Accumulation of the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu in ApoE–/–mice was not significantly greater than background (Figure b,d). Aortic radioactivity associated with the LyP-1-dendrimer
was 1.1 ± 0.26%ID/g, which was significantly higher than activity
resulting from injection of the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu (0.22 ± 0.05%ID/g) (Figure b and Table ). Furthermore, the aorta/blood
ratio of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu (3.67 ±
1.07%ID/g, n = 6) was significantly higher than that
of [18F]FBA-LyP-1 (1.21 ± 0.37%ID/g, n = 4) (p = 0.002) (). The significantly lower background signal from blood facilitates
detection of plaque within in vivo PET images.

Following venous administration,
the excised aorta from the PET
images of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu-treated
ApoE–/– mice (Figure a) showed higher activity in the aortic arch and descending aorta
than mice treated with (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu.
Further, the accumulation of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu in the aorta was significantly higher than in the heart
(Figure c, p &lt; 0.01).
Also, based on the biodistribution, the accumulation of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu in the aorta was 3-fold higher
than the closely adjacent heart (Figure d)
and 8-fold higher than in skeletal muscle (Table ). The accumulation of (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu, as compared with the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu, demonstrates that the LyP-1-dendrimer specifically binds
to plaque (Figure d).

It has been reported
that a positive charge on particles enhanced
uptake by osteoblastic, and mesenchymal stem cells. Although our results do not involve similar
particles, the net charge on (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-dendrimers, each +12, could potentially increase bone uptake, and
some bone accumulation was observed on PET-CT images (Figure ). We hypothesize that the greater bone uptake of
the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu, as compared to
the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu, may result from
receptor-mediated binding. The uptake of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM
observed in the spine demonstrated that the accumulation of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM in bone was greater than that of (ARAL)4-dendrimer-FAM and LyP-1-FAM ().

The biodistribution of the (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu was then assessed
in ApoE–/– mice (n = 10)
(Tables  and ). Three
hours after the administration of dendrimers,
the residual radioactivity of (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu in the clearance organs (liver, spleen and kidneys) was not significantly
different from that of the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu (Table ). This is also in agreement with
previous reports that the distribution of peptides [18F]FBA-LyP-1
and [18F]FBA-ARAL in these organs was not significantly
different () and that the FAM-labeled LyP-1-targeted
dendritic wedge was not specifically homing to the kidney. The higher uptake of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu in clearance organs (liver, spleen and
kidneys; Table ) as compared with [18F]FBA-LyP-1 might result from differences
in the molecular size. The uptake of both dendrimers was similar in
the lymph nodes. The results indicate that the accumulation in other
lymphatic tissues was not receptor mediated but instead represented
passive uptake. Further, greater radioactivity resulting from injection
of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu was also detected
in digestive organs such as the pancreas (3-fold, p &gt; 0.001), intestines (2-fold, p &gt; 0.001),
and stomach
(3-fold, p &gt; 0.05), compared to that from injection
of (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu.

(%ID/g)/(%ID/g).

When dendrimers are conjugated with
biological therapeutics, extended
circulation and local accumulation are desired. Therefore, subcutaneous
administration may be preferable to intravenous injection and is currently
utilized in clinical studies of miRNA efficacy. Further, enhanced
accumulation within the plaque has the potential to reduce the required
injected dose and therefore greatly reduce the cost of treatment.
To evaluate the transport of the dendrimer in the subcutaneous space
and the release into the blood pool, we performed a biodistribution
study over 24 h after subcutaneous injection of the (LyP-1)4- and (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu. Twenty four hours
following subcutaneous injection, aortic radioactivity (LyP-1: 0.53
± 0.12%ID/g and ARAL: 0.25 ± 0.09%ID/g) resulting from injection
of the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu was higher than
that of (ARAL)4-dendrimer-64Cu (Figure b, p = 0.033).
Ex vivo imaging of aortas with PET (Figure a) confirmed the higher accumulation of radioactivity in the aortic
arch from (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu injected ApoE–/– mice as compared with the ARAL-conjugated
dendrimer. In addition, the accumulation of radioactivity associated
with the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu was approximately
6-fold greater in the aorta than in muscle.

At the same time point, radioactivity in the heart (0.59
±
0.11%ID/g) and aorta (0.53 ± 0.12%ID/g) was similar (Figure c,d). The results support the hypothesis that the
subcutaneous injection of targeted dendrimers could produce a sustained
delivery of conjugated therapeutics to atherosclerotic plaque. Otherwise,
with the exception of the stomach, lung, kidneys, and blood, radioactivity
resulting from the LyP-1- and ARAL-dendrimers was similar (Table ).

Fluorescence Imaging Study of Atherosclerotic
Plaque with FAM
Labeled LyP-1, (LyP-1)4-Dendrimer-FAM and (ARAL)4-Dendrimer-FAM
Our previous study showed that LyP-1-FAM
penetrated into the plaque interior. Here, we also evaluated the distribution
of two dendrimers and the LyP-1 peptide labeled with 5(6)-carboxy
fluorescein (FAM). Plaque retention and distribution were greater
for the (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM as compared to the (ARAL)4-dendrimer-FAM (Figure a,b). Analysis
of optical images of plaque (Figure d) demonstrated
a significantly higher mean pixel intensity (MPI) of (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM (30.3 ± 5.8 MPI, p = 0.01) and
LyP-1-FAM (18.7 ± 4.04 MPI, p = 0.012) than
(ARAL)4-dendrimer-FAM (3.46 ± 1.6 MPI).

Based
on the biodistribution data for the entire aorta, the uptake of the
(LyP-1)4-dendrimer-64Cu (1.1%ID/g) was 3.5-fold
higher than [18F]FBA-LyP-1 (0.31%ID/g). Based on region of interest analysis from optical imaging,
the local accumulation of a (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM (30.3
± 5.8 MPI) in plaque, calculated as the MPI value, was higher
than monomeric LyP-1-FAM (18.7 ± 4.04 MPI) (Figure  and ); however, the
difference was not significant (p = 0.054, Figure d). Given that the PET biodistribution demonstrated
a significant difference, the lack of significance with optical imaging
likely results from challenges in quantifying the fluorescent intensity.
In part, this may result from image saturation at the vessel wall
and autofluorescence of vascular tissues. The result was agreement
with previous studies in which a LyP-1-wedge with a mass of 10 kDa
was efficiently internalized into tumor cells. Taken together, the results suggest that multimeric LyP-1
could increase drug delivery to plaque, enhancing the drug local concentration.

Conclusion
We visualized atherosclerotic
plaque in ApoE–/– mice with PET-CT and optical
imaging using p32-targeted dendrimers.
The (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-BAT was successfully synthesized
and labeled with 64Cu and enhanced accumulation as compared
with the monomeric peptide. Although FAM-labeled dendrimers were not
fully conjugated with peptides, fluorescent images of the aorta were
used to visualize the extravasated (LyP-1)4-dendrimer-FAM.
Finally, the building block synthesis approach we tested here is very
flexible, can be applied with various targeting peptides, and enables
a broad range of PET imaging studies for disease detection and the
assessment of therapeutic delivery.
