Most
immunomodulatory materials (e.g., vaccine adjuvants such as
alum) modulate adaptive immunity, and yet little effort has focused
on developing materials to regulate innate immunity, which get mentioned
only when inflammation affects the biocompatibility of biomaterials.
Traditionally considered as short-lived effector cells from innate
immunity primarily for the clearance of invading microorganisms without
specificity, neutrophils exhibit a key role in launching and shaping
the immune response. Here we show that the incorporation of unnatural
amino acids into a well-known chemoattractant—N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-phenylalanine (fMLF)—offers
a facile approach to create a de novo, multifunctional chemoattractant
that self-assembles to form supramolecular nanofibrils and hydrogels.
This de novo chemoattractant not only exhibits preserved cross-species
chemoattractant activity to human and murine neutrophils, but also
effectively resists proteolysis. Thus, its hydrogel, in vivo, releases
the chemoattractant and attracts neutrophils to the desired location
in a sustainable manner. As a novel and general approach to generate
a new class of biomaterials for modulating innate immunity, this work
offers a prolonged acute inflammation model for developing various
new applications.

Upon the breach of the host
physical barrier by intruding microorganisms, neutrophils, among all
the leukocytes, are the first to influx into focus for bacterial invasion
for host defense.1 Neutrophils used to
be considered to function exclusively as the effector cells in the
innate phase of immune response. However, the old view has been challenged
since a growing body of evidence has shown that neutrophils play a
crucial role in framing immune response, both innate and adaptive
immunity.2 For example, neutrophils are
found to have a B cell-helper neutrophil population in the splenic
marginal zone, and these neutrophils can activate marginal zone B
cells to secrete immunoglobulins against T cell-independent antigens.3

The efficient recruitment of neutrophils
depends on many signals,
including N-formyl peptides, chemokines, complement components, and
leukotrienes.1 As byproducts of protein
translation in the invading bacteria, N-formyl peptides form molecular
gradients originating from the bacteria in the infected tissue, and
the gradients of N-formyl peptides signal neutrophils to migrate (i.e.,
chemotaxis) toward their targets while overriding other minor signals,
such as IL-8 and MIP-2.1 Proposed in 1965
and confirmed in 1984, fMLF represents the best-known N-formyl peptide
and one of the most well-established chemoattractants for neutrophils
(Figure 1).4 Having
a well-defined molecular structure, fMLF offers an opportunity for
chemical modifications and for precise control and accurate understanding
of immunomodulation at the molecular level. Recognized for its potential
as a useful reagent to induce acute inflammation in vivo, fMLF, in
the form of aqueous solution, has been injected subcutaneously,5 intravenously,6 intraplantarly,7 intradermally,8 or
just topically applied on the microvasculature9 to study the biology of neutrophils for various applications. Although
the aqueous solution of fMLF is able to induce the accumulation of
neutrophils, its effect is relatively weak and transient (2–6
h).10

an fMLF-based hydrogelator
(3) to induce chemotaxis of neutrophils in vitro and
accumulation of neutrophils in vivo. In vitro assay: 3 induces chemotaxis of murine and human neutrophils at the minimum
effective concentrations of 1.13 μM and 11.3 nM, respectively.
In vivo assay: the hydrogel of 3 slowly releases 3 for attracting neutrophils to the location of the hydrogel
(at the dosage of 0.935 μmol per mouse). Notation: f = formyl,
M = l-methionyl residue, L = l-leucyl residue, F

residue.

Instead of weak and transient
acute inflammation, sometimes reagents
that can elicit inflammation for a longer period are highly desired.
However, the field of biomaterials concerning neutrophils and inflammation
has been focused on suppressing inflammation as the foreign body response
to biomaterials.11 Most recently, material
scientists have started to pay attention to regulation of innate immunity
and neutrophils, still focus on inflammation imaging12 and suppression.13 Demonstrated
in a recent work, the intratumoral injection of fMLF solution every
2 days after the inoculation of tumor cells slows tumor growth in
a xenograft tumor model.14 Similarly, the
daily intratumoral injection of another chemoattractant, chemerin,
decreases the tumor growth.15 In order
to maintain a meaningful local concentration of chemoattractants,
both studies required frequent intratumoral injections.14,15 Therefore, a formulation of chemoattractant (e.g., fMLF) for prolonged
release not only acts as a useful tool to study the biology of neutrophils
over long duration, but also holds promise for therapeutic applications,
like cancer treatment. This potential has already led to the exploration
of different formulations of fMLF,16−18 such as particles of
fMLF in suspensions produced by sonication for studying neutrophil
infiltration into pulmonary alveoli during murine pneumococcal pneumonia,16 physically encapsulated N-formyl peptides in
poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microbeads for
inducing chemotaxis of neutrophils,17 or
human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs)18 in vitro. Based on the same idea of physical
encapsulation by polymers, chemoattraction of regulatory T cells in
vivo has been achieved by releasing CCL22 from PLGA particles.19 Despite this progress, heterogeneous suspensions
of fMLF particles are far from ideal for in vivo applications due
to differences between batches, and physical encapsulation using polymeric
materials suffers from several limitations, such as burst release,
low capacity for payload, and slow bioresorption of the polymeric
materials, along with its inherent problem as mixtures of molecules
with different molecular weight. These limitations demand the development
of new approaches to attract neutrophils in vivo.

As an alternative,
learning from nature, we chose to develop a
biomimetic approach for sustained release of fMLF in vivo. Away from
the dominant drug delivery idea of drug loading onto vehicles, such
as biodegradable polymers, nature has provided a strategy, of which
natural peptides and proteins self-assemble to form functional amyloids
for sustained release.20 Certain hormones
such as prolactin and growth hormone form amyloids for storage, which
dissolve slowly as a way for sustained or regulated hormone secretion.21 This principle and mechanism have led to the
development of supramolecular nanofibrils and hydrogels22 of bioactive molecules as “self-delivery
drugs”.20 In fact, a hydrogel of
lanreotide acetate (i.e., Somatuline Depot),23 based on this mechanism, has found clinical application for treating
acromegaly. This success has stimulated the development of supramolecular
hydrogels as a unique depot for controlled release.20,23−25 However, existing examples of using self-assembly
of peptides as a releasing depot have almost all been discovered by
accident. The self-assembly property was not included in the molecular
design of the small molecular drug, which was discovered afterward.
However, the real challenge for a “releasing depot”
is how to modify existing bioactive molecules into derivatives with
preserved bioactivity while gaining the new function of self-assembly
into nanofibrils. Intrigued by the simplicity and effectiveness of
the “self-delivery drugs”, also from the perspective
of peptide engineering and peptide formulation, we hypothesized that,
by rational chemical derivatization, fMLF-derived peptides would form
supramolecular hydrogels without compromising the biological efficacy
of fMLF, and the corresponding hydrogels would deliver long-term efficacy
for local accumulation of neutrophils by sustained release of the
chemotactic hydrogelators (Figure 1).

To demonstrate the concept illustrated in Figure 1, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated several fMLF-derived
molecules; and we obtained N-formyl-l-methionyl-l-leucyl-l-3-(2-naphthyl)-alaninyl-d-3-(2-naphthyl)-alanine
(i.e., fMet-Leu-(2-Nal)-(D-2-Nal) shown as 3 in Figure 1). In addition to behaving as a hydrogelator, 3 exhibits three advantageous features: ability to form a
hydrogel efficiently (minimum gelation concentration (MGC) = 0.125%
w/v in DPBS buffer), enhanced stability against proteolysis, and preserved
activity to both mouse and human neutrophils. Moreover, the hydrogel
of 3, in the murine peritonitis model, stimulates a much
longer-lasting pro-inflammatory phase than fMLF solution does, and
exhibits a 2 orders of magnitude increase in neutrophil accumulation
compared to that of fMLF solution. This work, for the first time,
not only offers a facile approach to convert chemoattractants into
hydrogels with exceptional biostability and tailored activity for
controlled accumulation of neutrophils in vivo, but also validates
the concept of the supramolecular hydrogelators acting as chemoattractants
for homing cells in a sustainable manner. Besides being a useful tool
to study the biology of innate immunity, this prolonged inflammation
model holds promise for various potential therapeutic applications26 (e.g., inhibiting tumor growth,14,15 decreasing mortality caused by lethal sepsis after microbial infection,27 and acting as a basis for vaccine adjuvants28). Furthermore, the same principle can apply
to the design of molecular hydrogels of formyl peptide receptor (FPR)
antagonists, which finds direct applications in controlling pain caused
by microbial infection.29

Figure 2 shows the schematic representation
of the fMLF-derived peptides that self-assemble in water and form
hydrogels and their characterizations (e.g., TEM, rheological properties,
proteolytic stability, and the release profiles). The chemical structures
are shown in Supporting Information Figure S1. Based on the structure of fMLF, we mainly modified fMLF at the
C-terminus.30 Since the naphthyl group
promotes formation of hydrogels from small peptides,23,24 we connected an unnatural amino acid with a naphthyl group (2-Nal)
to fMLF to obtain fMLF-(2-Nal) (1). 1 self-assembles
in Dulbecco’s Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) buffer to form
a supramolecular hydrogel at a concentration of 0.2 w/v% (Figure 2A, inset). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
reveals the network of nanofibrils (around 16 nm in diameter) (Figure 2A) in the hydrogel of 1 (0.2 w/v%),
which shows storage modulus (G′) of around
50 Pa and critical strain of about 10.0% (Figure 2E,F). As shown in Figure 2G, incubation
with a powerful protease (e.g., proteinase K) causes more than 90%
of 1 to undergo hydrolysis in the first 2 h. The release
of 1 from its hydrogel finishes in about 8 h (Figure 2H).

To improve the stability of the hydrogelator
against proteolytic
enzymes, we replaced the fourth l-amino acid residue to the
corresponding d-amino acid residue31 to obtain a new peptide, fMLF-(D-2-Nal) (2), which
still forms a hydrogel (Figure 2B, inset) but
at a higher concentration (MGC: 0.4 w/v%) than that of 1. As shown in the TEM images, the nanofibrils in the hydrogel of 2 have diameters around 22 nm (Figure 2B). Rheology measurement shows the storage modulus and the critical
strain of the hydrogel of 2 to be around 200 Pa and about
1.0%, respectively (Figure 2E,F). The incorporation
of a d-amino acid, indeed, substantially enhances proteolytic
stability of 2 in comparison with that of 1. For example, in the presence of proteinase K, more than 80% and
40% of 2 remains after 2 h and after 12 h, respectively
(Figure 2G). The hydrogel of 2 collapses within the first 4 h and completely dissolves after 6
h in DPBS buffer at 37 °C (Figure 2H),
suggesting the relatively loose molecular packing in the hydrogel
of 2.

and the hydrogels. (A–D) Typical TEM images of negatively stained
fibrils of (A) the hydrogels of 1 (0.20 w/v%), (B) 2 (0.40 w/v%), (C) 3 (0.125 w/v%), and (D) 4 (0.075 w/v%), respectively, with the molecular representation
on top (all hydrogels are at pH = 7.4 in DPBS buffer; the scale bar
is 100 nm; notation: Ac = acetyl; inset: the optical images of the
hydrogels). (E) Strain sweep and (F) frequency sweep of the hydrogels
with the same concentrations as the hydrogels prepared for optical

mg (0.4 mg/mL) by adding 2.8 μL of proteinase K solution at
37 °C. (H) Release profiles of the monomers from the hydrogels
of 1, 2, 3, and 4 (0.4 w/v%) at 37 °C.

Therefore, to obtain an fMLF derivative that has better gelation
properties, we changed the third amino acid residue on 2 from Phe to 2-Nal, which gave the peptide fML-(2-Nal)-(D-2-Nal)
(3). This simple change boosts the intermolecular aromatic–aromatic
interaction that promotes molecular self-assembly in water for hydrogelation,
so 3 exhibits excellent gelation properties with an MGC
of 0.125 w/v% (Figure 2C, inset). The hydrogel
prepared at the concentration of 0.125 w/v% has nanofibrils with diameters
around 18 nm (Figure 2C), storage modulus around
100 Pa, and critical strain around 2.0% (Figure 2E,F). Not only does 3 maintain resistance to the proteinase
K proteolysis (Figure 2G), but the improved
gelation property also results in a longer sustained release of 3 in vitro. The stability of 3 is much higher
than that of fMLF itself.32 The hydrogel
of 3 releases about 60% of 3 after 24 h
incubation at 37 °C (Figure 2H).

The importance of the formyl group for the activity of the N-formyl
peptides has been well documented, and the replacement of the formyl
group by the acetyl group in fMLF causes a 1000 to 10 000 fold
activity drop.33 Therefore, we also synthesized
a control molecule of 3, AcML-(2-Nal)-(D-2-Nal) (4). It forms a hydrogel (Figure 2D,
inset) at a low concentration (MGC = 0.075 w/v%). The hydrogel of 4 contains nanofibrils with diameters around 17 nm (Figure 2D) and has a storage modulus around 140 Pa and a
critical strain around 2.0% (Figure 2E,F). 4 is less stable against proteolytic digestion by proteinase
K than 3. Matching with its excellent gelation property,
the hydrogel of 4 also gradually releases 4 (with 40% release at the first 24 h) (Figure 2H).

These four hydrogels, prepared at the MGCs of the hydrogelators,
exhibit comparable storage moduli (G′), loss
moduli (G″), and critical strains (Figure 2E,F). Together with the facts that the moduli of
these hydrogels depend little on the frequency and the nanofibrils
serving as the matrices of the hydrogels have close diameters (16–22
nm), these results suggest that the hydrogels of fMLF-based molecules
share similar morphological and rheological properties. In addition,
the MGC values of the hydrogelators correlate well with the release
profiles of the hydrogelators. For example, the order of the hydrogelators
having MGCs from high to low is 2, 1, 3, and 4, which is the same as the order of the
hydrogelator release rates (Figure 2H). This
trend suggests that molecular engineering of the hydrogelators to
control the MGC values should be effective and useful for tailoring
the release profiles of the chemoattractants.

After confirming
that the fMLF derivatives act as hydrogelators
and exhibit proteolytic stability, we determined their activity to
murine neutrophils by measuring chemotaxis and ROS production. Figure 3A shows the frames of the chemotaxis (performed
on the EZ-TAXIScan34) induced by different
molecules at 0, 5, and 10 min to determine the minimum effective concentrations
of the fMLF derivatives. The recorded frames of the first 20 min serve
as traces of cell migration (Figure 3B), which,
being analyzed by the algorithm shown in Figure 3C, provide three important parameters for neutrophil chemotaxis:
migration speed (Figure 3D), directionality
(0 to 1) (Figure 3E), and upward directionality
(−1 to 1) (Figure 3F) to characterize,
respectively, how fast the neutrophils move, how straight they migrate,
and how faithfully they follow the gradients of the chemoattractants.
Chemoattractants also induce the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) by the NADPH oxidase assembled on the plasma membrane and phagosome.1 Thereby, the quantification of ROS production
using isoluminol also indicates the activity of the chemoattractants.
According to Figure 3A–G, at its minimum
effective concentration (1.13 μM), which is about 1000 times
lower than the minimum gelation concentration, 3 not
only induces chemotaxis of murine neutrophils as effectively as fMLF
(i.e., the almost identical migration speed (Figure 3D) and directionality (Figure 3E),
and slightly better upward directionality (Figure 3F)), but also exhibits slightly more potent activity for generation
of ROS than that of fMLF (Figure 3G). The reason
for the faster ROS production activated by 3 is currently
unknown, which might be related to its interaction with formyl peptide
receptors (FPRs). Interestingly, 1, at 113 nM, exhibits
similar chemotactic activities as that of fMLF at 1.13 μM (Figure 3A), but generates only half as much ROS as fMLF
(Figure 3G). 2 exhibits drops
in the chemotactic activity and the ROS production when compared with
fMLF, which matches the previously reported results that the d enantiomer is a less active chemoattractant than the l enantiomer.354 failed to induced the chemotaxis
even at 113 μM, 100 fold of the minimum effective concentration
of 3 (Supporting Information Figure
S2), which matches the 1000 to 10 000 fold activity
drop reported in the literature.33 Therefore, 4 is considered to have no chemotactic activity, and the hydrogel
of 4 can be used as a control for the hydrogel of 3.

by fMLF-derived hydrogelators (1, 2, and 3) in vitro. (A) Snapshots of chemotaxis of murine neutrophils
at 0, 5, and 10 min induced by the gradient of fMLF; 1, 2, and 3 performed on EZ-TAXIScan,34 with the blank control. (B) Traces of 20 typical

(G) ROS production in the neutrophils (5 × 105) after
stimulation with DMSO (0.1 v/v%, as the negative control), fMLF (10
μM), 1 (1 μM), 2 (10 μM),
and 3 (10 μM).

These results clearly show that 3 fulfills all
three
criteria of the molecular design: excellent gelation property for
the purpose of sustained release, fair stability against proteolysis,
and well preserved chemotactic activity to murine neutrophils. Encouraged
by the in vitro activity of 3 to attract murine neutrophils,
we also investigated the activity of 3 on human neutrophils.
As shown in Figure 4A, the minimum effective
concentration of fMLF to human neutrophils is 11.3 nM determined by
a 10-fold serial dilution, which is 100 times lower than the minimum
effective concentration of fMLF to murine neutrophils (1.13 μM).
This result agrees with the observation that fMLF’s activity
to murine FPR is 100 to 10 000 fold less than to human and
rabbit FPRs.36 Moreover, 3, at 11.3 nM, exhibits the same effectiveness as fMLF to human neutrophils,
as evidenced by the indistinguishable migration traces (Figure 4B), similar migration parameters (Figure 4C,D,E), and essentially identical ROS production
(Figure 4F). Although the binding pockets of
the mouse and human FPRs might be quite different, which is suggested
by fMLF’s significantly different activity to FPRs,36 the well preserved chemotactic activity of 3 to both mouse and human neutrophils indicates that 3 maintains binding to both human and murine FPRs. How the
modification can satisfy the binding to the two seemingly quite different
pockets is surprisingly interesting and certainly deserves further
exploration.

After successfully demonstrating the in vitro properties
(i.e.,
gelation property for sustained release, stability, and the chemotactic
activity to both mouse and human neutrophils) of 3, we
used an in vivo murine model to determine whether the hydrogel of 3 achieves a longer proinflammatory effect for attracting
neutrophils than the solution of fMLF. We collected peritoneal lavages
for flow cytometry 24 h after the injection of DPBS solution, fMLF
solution, and the gels of 1, 3, and 4 into mice, respectively. In the representative flow cytometry
plots (Figure 5A) using the markers Gr1 and
CD11b, the double positive (Gr1+CD11b+) corresponds
to neutrophils and the Gr1–CD11b+ are
monocytes macrophages. The acute inflammation starts with the rapid
influx of neutrophils and switches to monocyte-derived inflammatory
macrophages, both from the blood. Although it is not clear cut, the
initial influx with a high percentage of neutrophils is considered
the pro-inflammatory phase and the later stage with dominant macrophages
is the resolution phase. Therefore, the ratio of neutrophils to macrophages
is the indicator of the inflammation phase.37 As shown in Figure 5A, while the effect of
the solution of fMLF almost disappears 24 h after the injection, the
hydrogel of 3, having the same amount of N-formyl peptides
as the fMLF solution, still attracts high counts of neutrophils. According
to the quantification (Figure 5B), the neutrophil
number attracted by the hydrogel of 3 is 2 orders of
magnitude higher than that of the solution of fMLF. Moreover, the
ratio of the number of neutrophils vs the number of macrophages (Figure 5C) suggests that the inflammation of the peritoneum
(peritonitis) induced by the hydrogel of 3 is in a much
earlier phase than the solution of fMLF, which is in the resolution
phase of the inflammation. Although the hydrogel of 4 also results in stronger accumulation of neutrophils than the solution
of fMLF does, the total number of neutrophils is still 1 order of
magnitude lower than that induced by the hydrogel of 3 (Figure 5B). In addition, the ratio of neutrophils
to macrophages (Figure 5C) clearly shows that
the inflammation induced by the hydrogel of 4 is also
close to the resolution phase. These results agree with the chemotactic
activity of the hydrogelators 3 and 4, and
suggest the accumulation of neutrophils caused by the hydrogel of 4 probably due to the inflammatory response toward stable
foreign materials.

Figure 4 Induction of chemotaxis and ROS production of human neutrophils
by 3 in vitro. (A) Snapshots of chemotaxis of purified
neutrophils from healthy human donors at 0, 5, and 10 min induced
by fMLF, 3, and PBS (as the control) performed on EZ-TAXIScan.
(B) Traces of 20 typical migrating neutrophils corresponding to different
chemoattractants. (C) Migration speed, (D) directionality, and (E)
upward directionality of the human neutrophils during chemotaxis from
three independent samples, and each sample has 20 cell migration traces.
(F) ROS production in the neutrophils (5 × 105) after
the addition of fMLF (100 nM), 3 (100 nM), and PBS (as
the blank control).

As the other control,
the hydrogel of 1 results in
similar results as the solution of fMLF: low total number of neutrophils
and low ratio of neutrophils to macrophages 24 h after the injections
(Figure 5B and C). Although 1 is
roughly 10 times more chemotactically active than 3 (Figure 3), the hydrogel of 1 releases more
rapidly than the hydrogel of 3, and 1 is
less stable than 3. Therefore, the stronger accumulation
of neutrophils induced by the hydrogel of 3 than by the
hydrogel of 1 likely not only is due to the inflammatory
response to stable foreign materials (as the case of the hydrogel
of 4), but also originates from the sustained release
of more stable chemoattractive hydrogelators. This result suggests
that it is feasible to modulate inflammation by controlling the rheological
properties of the hydrogels, the release profiles, and the stabilities
of the hydrogelators.

Because neutrophils, as short-lived cells,1 have a half-life of 1.5 h in the circulation
in mice, the accumulation
of neutrophils in this murine model is different from the other cell
accumulations where the attracted cells remain alive. Therefore, the
results, shown in Figure 5, could not be interpreted
as the explosive accumulation of neutrophils induced in the first
couple of hours all at once and then no activity to follow. Instead,
the results from 24 h strongly support that the accumulation of neutrophils
is due to a constant attraction by the sustained release of the hydrogelators
from the hydrogel of 3.

Figure 5 Hydrogels stimulate prolonged accumulation
of murine neutrophils
in vivo. (A) Representative flow cytometry plots showing the neutrophils
(Gr1+CD11b+) and the monocytes and macrophages
(Gr1−CD11b+) from the cells collected
from the peritoneal lavage of wild-type mice 24 h after receiving
the intraperitoneal injections (IP injections) of 500 μL of
PBS (as the control), the solution of fMLF, and the hydrogels of 1, 3, and 4 containing 0.935 μmol
of peptides. (B) The number of neutrophils and (C) the ratio of the
number of neutrophils vs the number of macrophages according to the
FACS quantification from three independent experiments.

Forty-eight hours after injections (Supporting
Information Figure S3), the number of neutrophils attracted
by the hydrogel of 3 is 1.1 ± 0.3 × 104 and the ratio of neutrophils to macrophages is 0.05 ±
0.03, which shows that the peritonitis induced by the hydrogel of 3 also moves into the resolution phase, suggesting that the
controlled release exhausts between 24 and 48 h. This might be related
to the watery environment of the peritoneum due to peritoneal fluid.

In summary, this study illustrates the evolution of multifunctional
molecular hydrogelators for attracting neutrophils in vitro and in
vivo. As the new class of “self-delivery” biomaterials,
supramolecular hydrogels are only in their infancy for immunomodulation,
with some initial but exciting exploration on vaccines for adaptive
immunity.38 Our work is the first example
of using molecular self-assembly for the construction of immunomodulatory
materials for innate immunity. The self-assembled hydrogel of fMLF-derived
peptides, as a unique tool, can be very useful to researchers who
need to induce sustained innate immune recruitment, which had been
unavailable before. Furthermore, this hydrogel also holds therapeutic
potential that has yet to be explored. More broadly, besides fMLF,
there are many small biological peptides, playing essential roles
in diverse biological functions. However, our preliminary study on
the attracting neutrophils to the tumor sites on a B16–F10
melanoma model indicates that the peritumoral injection of the gel
of 3 or the solution of fMLF gas has little effect on
the growth of the tumor in rat. This result suggests more extensive
study on this observation is needed. The concept illustrated in this
work along with other work shows the potential to modify those peptides
to form supramolecular hydrogels without compromising the bioactivity,39 and the insight of molecular design gained from
this work can be very useful for the further development of immunomodulating
hydrogels. The general concept of using supramolecular hydrogel of
bioactive small molecules as a “self-delivery” system,
thus, provides a novel approach to therapeutics and an attractive
and validated alternative to the traditional drug delivery system.
