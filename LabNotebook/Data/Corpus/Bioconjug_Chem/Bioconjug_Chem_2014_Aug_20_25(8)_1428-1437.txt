Introduction
Small molecule imaging
probes have been extensively studied to
monitor and quantify physiological processes., Steroid
receptors are an example of a target for this type of probe because
these proteins regulate a number of cell processes through transcriptional
regulation of genes. The ability to noninvasively
interrogate the function of these important receptors will guide the
development of new therapeutic targets for hormone-dependent diseases
such as endometriosis and breast, ovarian, uterine, and prostate cancers.− Some commonly prescribed chemotherapeutics, such as the estrogen
receptor (ER)-targeting tamoxifen, are designed to block the steroid
receptor activity that facilitates tumor growth, and receptor status
is frequently determined for these diseases prior to treatment., The presence of both receptors, PR and ER, in breast cancer correlates
positively with patient survival rate, whereas the loss of steroid
receptor expression coincides with the disease becoming more aggressive
and drug resistant.− Furthermore, triple-negative breast cancer, tumors
that do not express PR, ER, or a third important marker, Her2, stands
as the most aggressive subtype. Treatment of receptor-negative disease
requires a wholly different approach when compared to that for receptor-expressing
cells. Noninvasively determining receptor status may be critical in
detecting new lesions, categorizing tumors, and determining when disease
is becoming refractory with current treatment, thus improving disease
prognosis. Due to this significant role of steroid receptors in tumor
progression, these proteins represent excellent imaging targets for
noninvasive molecular characterization and monitoring of cancers and
benign disease states such as endometriosis.,

In vivo imaging of steroid receptors has been demonstrated
using
positron emission tomography (PET).,− However, rapid metabolism of probes by 20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
limited the use of these probes in human subjects.− In addition,
PET can be restricted by limited spatial and temporal resolution.,, In contrast, MRI has high temporal
and spatial resolution without exposing patients to radiation. Typically, MRI uses contrast agents to increase
local signal intensity by distinguishing tissues or organs that are
magnetically similar but histologically distinct. These probes make
use of a paramagnetic ion, Gd(III), that decreases the proton spin-lattice
relaxation time (T1) of protons., This decrease in T1 is manifested as
bright regions in an acquired T1-weighted
MR image. Structural modification of the chelate provides the opportunity
to target specific pathological processes.,−

Imaging probes targeted for ER and PR have many similarities
in
their structure and function. The specificity for a given receptor
lies in the targeting ligand that is used for synthesis. A number
of steroid receptor-targeted MRI contrast agents have been developed.− For example, ProGlo is a progesterone receptor (PR)-targeted agent
that has shown promising cellular retention and selectivity in tissues
and tumors with elevated PR expression. The use of steroid receptor-targeted MRI contrast agents has been
limited to preclinical research. Challenges with previous generations
of PR-targeted probes demonstrated the potential need for modification
due to the inability to test them using intravenous (i.v.) injection,
the most commonly employed method of administration for clinically
used MR contrast probes.

To determine
the relationship among complex linker length and solubility,
toxicity, tissue distribution, and MR contrast, we synthesized and
biologically evaluated a series of PR-targeted MR imaging probes with
variable linker length (Figure ). By systematic
alteration of the aliphatic linker between the Gd(III) chelate and
the steroid, an increase in linker length could be correlated to an
increase in hydrophobicity. The most hydrophilic complex exhibited
the lowest toxicity in PR(+) human breast cancer cells. In vivo, complex 1 preferentially accumulated in tissues that expressed PR
when injected either i.v. or intraperitoneally (i.p.). The highest
concentration of 1 was observed in the uterus after i.p.
injection, indicating that i.v. administration does not enhance PR-targeted
MR probe delivery. Complex 1 was additionally found to
enhance PR-rich tissues compared with muscle in T1-weighted images taken at 9.4 T. Overall, further optimization
through rational probe design yielded PR-targeted contrast probes
with increased water solubility and allowed for multiple routes of
in vivo administration but ultimately did not appreciably alter delivery
to target tissues or provide a significant advancement in contrast
efficiency. These studies illustrate that optimization of a targeted
MR agent should include consideration of solubility to change the
route of delivery as well as steroid biology, which dictates tissue
accumulation.

Results
Synthesis of a Series of
PR-Targeted MRI Contrast Agents with
Varying Linker Lengths
Previous experiments have demonstrated
that ProGlo successfully targets PR receptors in vivo while enhancing
contrast in MR images of tumor xenografts., The hydrophobicity of ProGlo and solubility in aqueous media limited
the method of in vivo administration., Here, we have
focused on preserving the structural foundation of earlier generations
of these probes while increasing solubility to determine if delivery
through the blood enhances bioactivity (Figure ).

Synthesis of complexes 1 and 4 were performed with minor modification to published procedures. The synthesis of 2 and 3 was initiated with the coupling of either 1,4-dibromobutane or 1,5-dibromopentane
to 21-hydroxyprogesterone. In order not to inhibit the binding affinity
of the steroid, attachment of the contrast probe was carried out on
the D-ring ().−

Structures of PR-targeted
contrast probes, 1–4. The alkane
linker between the PR-targeting moiety and Gd(III)
chelate was modified to elucidate the effect of linker length on toxicity,
receptor binding, and tissue distribution in vivo.

Relaxivity and Octanol–Water Partition
Coefficients
The relaxivity of a MR contrast agent is defined
by its ability
to increase the relaxation rates of the surrounding water proton spins.
The relaxivity values measured by the PR probes described were similar
to clinically used Gd(III) contrast agents (Table ). Octanol–water partition coefficients (logP values)
were measured and reflect the hydrophobicity of the agents (Table ). Compound 1 exhibited the most negative
logP value (−1.06 ± 0.02)., Not surprisingly,
complex 4, which has a six carbon atom linker arm, was
the most hydrophobic (logP value of 1.40 ± 0.08). Complexes 2 (four carbon linker) and 3 (five carbon linker)
have intermediate logP values around 0, −0.08 ± 0.06 and
0.11 ± 0.01, respectively.

This trend in hydrophobicity
is additionally mirrored in the HPLC retention times of each complex.
An evaporative light scattering detector, ELSD, was used to obtain
a trace of each complex upon elution from a C18 column. The mobile
phase was a gradient ramp from 100% water to 100% acetonitrile. Complex 1 was detected at 9.9 min and was the most hydrophilic of
the complexes. The addition of the aliphatic linker caused a significant
increase in retention time, as corroborated in the logP values. Complexes 2 and 3 have similar retention times at 16.1
and 16.7 min, respectively. The most hydrophobic complex, 4, was retained longest on the column, with an elution time of 17.3
min.

As previously observed, the Gd(III) chelate has a pronounced
effect
on the binding affinity of progesterone to the receptor as compared
to unmodified progesterone., A competitive binding
assay quantified the effect of linker length on the affinity of the
contrast agents for PR (Figure ), and IC50 values are reported in Table . Complex 4 binds to PR with a similar affinity as that previously observed. Complex 2 and 3 bound
PR with a similar affinity to that of 4. Complex 1 demonstrated the lowest affinity for the receptor among
the series (p &lt; 0.01), with almost 100-fold lower
affinity compared to that of 2–4.

Correlation Observed between
LogP Values and Cytotoxicity
One aspect of enhanced water
solubility for PR contrast agents
may be that it reduces toxicity. MTS cell viability assays determine
the cytotoxicity of the probes in vitro after incubation with varying
concentrations of each complex in PR(+) T47D or PR(−) MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure ). Cytotoxicity correlated to
logP values in PR(+) T47D cells. Complex 1 exhibited
the lowest toxicity at all of the concentrations tested and was the
least hydrophobic. Complexes 2–4 exhibited
similar toxicity in a trend following their logP values (reported
in Table ). In MDA-MB-231, all agents had
similar toxicity profiles, implying that probe toxicity is associated
with the presence of PR ().

Cytotoxicity

obtained through MTS assay on the PR(+) T47D cell line. Complex 1 is the least toxic, followed by 2, 3, and 4. Error bars indicate ±SEM.

Correlation Observed between LogP Values
and Cellular Association
PR is an intracellular protein,
and interaction between the contrast
probes and PR requires cellular uptake utilizing a diffusion mechanism
through the cellular membrane. Uptake experiments of the probes to
PR(+) T47D and PR(−) MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells evaluated
the cell permeability of the probes. Time-dependent uptake was not
observed in the PR(−) cells for any of the reported complexes
where Gd(III) concentrations remained consistent over all of the time
points as measured by ICP-MS. Time-dependent accumulation was observed
for 1 and 2 in PR(+) cells (Figure ). Uptake of 3 and 4 in
PR(+) cells increased dramatically after 1 h, with higher accumulation
at 4 h before decreasing by 8 h. This trend in cellular accumulation
correlated to hydrophobicity, where the most hydrophobic complex, 4, had the highest concentrations of probe in cells. In PR(+)
cells, the concentrations of all of the steroid-conjugated probes
are markedly higher than that found in PR(−) cells at all time
points. This suggests that PR plays a role in the retention of these
probes and that the ability to cross the cell membrane correlated
with hydrophobicity.

Complexes accumulate preferentially in cells that express
PR. Time-dependent
uptake experiments were performed in PR(−) MDA-MB-231 cells
(A) and PR(+) T47D cells (B). Error bars indicate ±SEM. Statistical
difference determined using two-way ANOVA test. * p &lt; 0.05.

PR Activation Is Retained
as Water Solubility Increases
To further demonstrate that
the MR probes cross the cell membrane
and bind PR, the ligand-activated transcription factor activity of
PR was exploited using a luciferase reporter assay (Figure A). Upon activation, progesterone receptors dimerize
and bind to a region of DNA referred to as the progesterone response
element (PRE). Ligation of this DNA element to a segment of DNA encoding
the luciferase gene can verify the activation of PR by these complexes
through the formation of a functional transcription complex. It was
expected that these agents have similar profiles of receptor activation
as that of the previously developed PR-targeted MR complexes, as the
chemical modification was performed in the same position.

From
the series of contrast agents, 4 activated transcription
of the luciferase reporter gene most effectively (29.6-fold greater
than solvent at 0.5 μM), whereas at the same concentration, 3 and 2 activated the reporter gene to a lesser
extent (8.9- and 10.5-fold, respectively). Contrast agent 1 demonstrated the least transcriptional activation (1.2-fold). The
most hydrophobic of compounds, 4 (ProGlo), was the most
effective transcriptional activator, which is expected, as this complex
displayed the highest binding affinity to PR. Due to the hydrophilicity
and low toxicity of 1, higher concentrations of agent
can be administered without harmful outcomes. The luciferase assay
demonstrated that at this higher concentration of complex 1 a measurable higher activation of receptor (comparable to complexes 2 and 3) was observed. Activation of luciferase
activity by progesterone and contrast agents is effectively blocked
with the progesterone antagonist RU486, demonstrating that the activation
of PR by these complexes is specific ().

Transcriptional activation of an endogenous PR-regulated
gene,
ZBTB16, confirmed probe activation efficiency (Figure B). Similar to the luciferase reporter assay, 4 induced transcription of ZBTB16 at the highest rate, followed by 3, 2, and finally 1 being the least
efficient while still maintaining the ability to activate transcription.
The highly lipophilic 4 appears have the greatest ability
to traverse the cell membrane and activate transcription.

Complexes retain
the ability to activate PR after chemical modification:
the addition of the Gd(III) chelate to the PR-targeting moiety. Incubation
with complexes resulted in transcriptional activation of the luciferase
reporter gene (A). Transcription of an endogenous PR-inducible gene
was monitored (B). Complex 4 was the most potent in both
assays. Error bars indicate ±SEM. Statistical differences as
indicated by asterisks measured by one-way ANOVA test. ** p &lt; 0.05, * p &lt; 0.05 (when compared
to samples treated with only DMSO).

Accumulation of Complex 1 in Uterus after in Vivo
i.p. Injection
By evaluating the in vivo distribution of
PR-targeted complexes, we were able to distinguish if i.v. or i.p.
injections would be advantageous in terms of accumulation in PR-expressing
tissues. Despite lower cellular retention and PR binding affinity,
complex 1 was the only agent that was completely soluble
in saline. Therefore, 1 was the only agent suitable for
i.v. administration and was used to directly compare if i.v. or i.p.
administration could influence cellular accumulation in PR-expressing
organs. Given that most traditional MR contrast agents are administered
i.v., yet most steroids are delivered i.p. or subcutaneously, a direct
comparison of how the steroid modified agent would accumulate in PR-expressing
tissues following standard i.p. and i.v. administration was performed.
Following i.v. or i.p. injection, the organs from female CD-1 mice
were harvested at 6 and 24 h. The total nanograms of Gd(III) per gram
of tissue, as measured by ICP-MS, is shown in Figure .

On the basis of the expression of PR, the organs of
interest include the mammary gland, the ovaries, and the uterus. A
section of muscle was used as a negative control, as the probe complexes
should not accumulate in the muscle. The data is presented normalized
to the average saline ICP values. The highest concentrations of Gd(III)
from both routes of administration were found in the uterus and ovaries,
similar to previous studies using MR and PET agents., The highest concentration of complex 1 was found in
the uterus from the i.p. injection, significantly greater than corresponding
accumulation due to i.v. administration (Figure  and ). In the ovary and mammary
gland, 1 accumulated equivalently at 6 h but was greater
after i.p. injection at 24 h. Taken together, these results demonstrate
that i.v. injection does not increase delivery to PR-expressing tissues,
suggesting i.v. administration is not necessary for PR-targeted MR
probes.

Complex 1 accumulates in tissues that have high concentrations
of PR such as the uterus and ovary. 1 was injected either
i.v. or i.p. into CD-1 female mice, and organs were harvested after
6 (A) or 24 (B) h. Data is presented normalized to saline ICP values.
Error bars indicate ±SEM. Statistical differences determined
through two-way ANOVA test. *** p &lt; 0.0001, ** p &lt; 0.001, * p &lt; 0.05.

Complex 1 Enhanced PR(+) Tissues
in Vivo
To determine whether complex 1, dissolved
in saline,
would increase the contrast-to-noise ratio of PR(+) relative to PR(−)
tumors in vivo, a preliminary xenograft tumor model in athymic nude
mice was utilized. T47D (PR(+)) cells on the left and MDA-MB-231 (PR(−))
cells on the right were injected subcutaneously. Mice (n = 2) were injected i.p. with 1 and imaged at 6 h postinjection.

Contrast enhancement is observed above background
muscle in the
PR(+) tumor, Figure A. To ensure that the
change in image contrast was due to the accumulation of Gd(III), the
tumors were harvested, and Gd(III) concentration was quantified by
ICP-MS, Figure B. The action of 1 did not surpass that of previously synthesized complex 4 which more effectively increased contrast resulting in a higher
fold change between MR signal preinjection and at each time point.

Discussion and Conclusions
The presence
and localization of steroid receptors (such as PR)
are important diagnostic and prognostic markers in hormone-dependent
diseases. The development of a noninvasive
method to probe PR status would allow for repeat measurements, decreased
patient discomfort, personalized treatment decisions, and improved
characterization of the tumor mass. The previously developed PR-targeted
MR probe, ProGlo, exhibited selective accumulation and MR enhancement
of PR-rich tissues and tumors in vivo when delivered either i.p. or
s.c. The insolubility of ProGlo and other
PR-targeted contrast agents in aqueous solutions precluded the ability
to investigate i.v. administration. Synthesis of a linker length series
of PR-targeted MR probes was conducted to increase water solubility
and lower toxicity and to determine if administration route is important
for delivery. Of the three new MR probes, only complex 1 was completely water soluble, enabling the direct comparison between
i.p. or i.v. injection for accumulation in PR-expressing tissues.

With increasing water solubility of PR-targeted probes, a mixture
of positive and negative biological properties arose. As hydrophilicity
increased, the cytotoxicity of the complexes decreased. Complex 4, ProGlo, was shown to be the most hydrophobic and exhibited
the highest toxicity, whereas the water-soluble complex 1 demonstrated the lowest toxicity. The increased toxicity of ProGlo
can be partially attributed to additional nonspecific interactions
due to hydrophobicity; conversely, it can also be attributed to progesterone
signaling, as progesterone itself can be toxic., However, with increasing water solubility, other biological properties
such as receptor binding and the ability to cross the cell membrane
were blunted. The more hydrophilic the compound, the more the likelihood
that the probe will effectively be taken up into cells decreases,
as observed with the cell accumulation assay. In addition, the binding
of 1 to PR was decreased 100-fold compared to that of 2–4, potentially due to increased steric
hindrance of the Gd(III) chelate. The decreased ability to cross the
cell membrane and bind PR was reflected in the lower transcriptional
activation. Taken together, an ideal amount of each characteristic,
hydrophobicity to allow for cell uptake and hydrophilicity to increase
probe safety, is essential for the optimized PR-targeted contrast
probe.

The optimal delivery route for a PR-targeted MR probe
is not straightforward.
Typically, steroids are delivered s.c. or i.p. Alternatively, currently
available MR contrast probes are commonly injected i.v. or administered
orally. Given that a PR-targeted MR probe is mixture of the two aforementioned
components explicitly testing the route of administration for effectively
targeting PR-expressing tissues is a necessary foundation of this
study.

Complex 1 was the only probe tested that
could be
completely dissolved into a saline solution and therefore was the
only appropriate contrast agent to investigate the importance of delivery
route. Although the binding and cellular association of this complex
was significantly lower than the others under investigation, it was
the least toxic. If i.v. delivery were essential to targeting tissues
far from the peritoneal cavity such as mammary tissue, then this would
allow for the use of a higher concentration of agent when performing
in vivo studies with this probe, and, as mentioned, a higher concentration
of this probe allows it to bind and activate PR comparably to the
others. The mammary tissue, not located in the peritoneal cavity,
showed no preference for delivery route. Intraperitoneal injections
led to the highest concentration of Gd(III) to be found in the uterus
compared with the ovary and mammary gland. This concentration of Gd(III)
was highly retained even after 24 h, with no adverse effects observed
in the animals. Intravenous administration allowed the probe to access
and accumulate selectively in PR-rich tissues, albeit to a lesser
extent than i.p. administration in tissues located within the peritoneal
cavity. Intravenously delivered compounds must circulate systemically
and likely become bound to serum hormone binding globulin. The observed
increased accumulation in the uterus (at both 6 and 24 h) and ovary
(at 24 h) following i.p. injection could be due to direct contact
with the tissue, since both tissues are located in the peritoneal
cavity, leading to an effectively higher concentration of 1 in the tissue.

In vivo imaging with complex 1 was not able to distinguish
PR(+) from PR(–) tumors more effectively than previously tested
complex 4. Analysis of Gd(III) concentration by ICP-MS
reveals higher average retention of 1 in the PR(+) tumor
compared with that in the PR(−) tumor, but not significantly.
The increase in field strength (from 7 to 9.4 T) prevents an exact
comparison between complex 4 and current work; however,
at the same concentration and using the same xenograft model, complex 4 provided significant enhancement in contrast-to-noise of
PR(+) versus PR(−) tumors in vivo. Mice recovered quickly after
injection with 1, and no toxicity in the animal was observed.

In conclusion, a series of PR-targeted MR contrast agents with
varying linker lengths was developed to impact solubility. These agents
associated with cells and activated PR to varying extents. Toxicity
and lipophilicity was shown to increase with increasing linker length.
Despite the findings that complex 4 was more effective
in binding and activating PR, the hydrophilic properties of complex 1 permit it to be used safely at higher concentrations and
to investigate the route of delivery for targeting PR-expressing tissues. 1 accumulates in tissues that express a high concentration
of PR, but i.v. delivery, made possible by changes to water solubility,
did not improve targeting to PR-expressing tissues. MR contrast was
enhanced at 9.4 T, but 1 did not display a marked improvement
over the previously investigated 4. This demonstrates
that focusing solely on the water solubility of the probe will not
easily yield an optimized contrast agent for the imaging of hormone-dependent
disease in vivo. Further optimization is required to develop the most
effective probe to fulfill this urgent clinical need for noninvasive
imaging of hormone-dependent diseases.

Relaxivity
Solutions of 1–4 were prepared in 400 μL of Millipore water containing
1% DMSO for T1 and T2 acquisition to a concentration of 0.500 mM. DMSO was required
for solubility of 2–4. DMSO can affect
relaxivity in that protons are shifted downfield, but, as the concentration
of DMSO used for these studies is so low, little effect from the solvent
mixture is observed. Serial dilutions were performed to yield the
experimental concentrations of 0.500, 0.250, 0.125, 0.063, and 0.031
mM. T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured on a Bruker mq60 NMR analyzer equipped
with Minispec V2.51 Rev.00/NT software (Billerica, MA) operating at
1.41 T (60 MHz) and 37 °C. T1 relaxation
times were measured using an inversion recovery pulse sequence (t1_ir_mb)
using the following parameters: 4 scans per point, 10 data points
for fitting, monoexponential curve fitting, phase cycling, 10 ms first
pulse separation, and a recycle delay and final pulse separation ≥
5T1. Measurements were performed in triplicate.
The Gd(III) concentration of each solution was determined using ICP-MS
on a computer-controlled (Plasmalab software) Thermo X series II ICP-MS
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) operating in standard
mode equipped with an ESI SC-2 autosampler (Omaha, NE). The inverse
of the relaxation time (1/T1, s–1) (taken as the average of the three replicates) was plotted against
Gd(III) concentration (mM) and fitted to a straight line with R2 &gt; 0.99. The slope of the fitted line was
recorded
as the relaxivity, r1.

Octanol–Water
Partition Coefficients
 Each complex
(0.5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of a 1:1 mixture of water/1-octanol.
After shaking the sample tube vigorously for 30 s, the tube was placed
on a rotator for gentle mixing for 4 h. The tube was removed from
the rotator, and complete separation of the aqueous and organic phases
was allowed over 10 h. Fifty microliters was removed from each layer
and subjected to ICP-MS to determine the Gd(III) concentration in
each layer. The partition coefficient was calculated from the following
equationwhere logP is the logarithm of the
partition
coefficient, Co is the concentration of
Gd(III) in the 1-octanol layer, and Cw is the concentration of Gd(III) in the water layer.

ICP-MS Sample
Preparation and Instrument Parameters
For logP measurements,
ACS reagent grade nitric acid (70%) was added
to solutions of the agent in water or 1-octanol (for a 1.0:1.0 v/v
sample/nitric acid) in 15 mL conical tubes and placed at 65 °C
for 4 h to allow for complete sample digestion. For samples in 1-octanol,
caps were removed from tubes and replaced to vent tubes every 30 min
due to the buildup of pressure. Filtered, deionized H2O
(18.2 MΩ·cm) and multielement internal standard containing
Bi, Ho, In, Li, Sc, Tb, and Y (Inorganic Ventures, Christiansburg,
VA) were added to produce a final solution of 3.0% nitric acid (v/v)
and 5.0 ng/mL internal standard. Instrument calibration was accomplished
by preparing individual-element Gd(III)(III) standards (Inorganic
Ventures, Christiansburg, VA, USA) using concentrations of 0.7813,
1.563, 3.125, 6.250, 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, 100.0, and 200.0 ng/mL containing
3.0% nitric acid (v/v) and 5.0 ng/mL of the multielement internal
standard.

General Cell Culture and Animal Studies
Dulbecco’s
modified phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), media, sera, and dissociation
reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cell culture
consumables (flasks, plates, etc.) were purchased from VWR (Radnor,
PA). Charcoal dextran stripped FBS was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals
(Lawrenceville, GA). MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured using phenol red
free α-MEM (modified to contain 20 ng/mL insulin) supplemented
with 10% FBS (characterized) or with 10% charcoal dextran stripped
FBS. T47D cells were cultured using phenol red free RPMI 1640 (modified
to contain 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, 1.0 mM HEPES, and 4.5 g/L glucose)
supplemented with 10% FBS or 10% charcoal dextran stripped FBS. Prior
to all experiments, cells were plated in the appropriate media containing
FBS. After plating, this media was replaced with media containing
charcoal dextran stripped FBS and incubated at 37 °C in a 5.0%
CO2 incubator for 24 h at which point the media was replaced with fresh charcoal dextran
stripped FBS containing media, and the cells were incubated an additional
24 h prior to beginning the experiment. MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells
were harvested by incubation with 0.25% TrypLE for 10 min at 37 °C
in a 5.0% CO2 incubator. All incubations were carried out
at 37 °C in a 5.0% CO2 incubator unless otherwise
specified.

Female CD-1 mice, acquired from Harlan (Indianapolis,
IN), and female Balb/C athymic nude mice, acquired from Charles River
(Wilmington, MA), were housed under pathogen-free conditions. All
animal studies were conducted at University of Illinois at Chicago
in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and established institutional animal
use and care protocols.

Cell Counting and Percent Cell Viability
Determination Using
Guava EasyCyte Mini Personal Cell Analyzer (PCA) System
After
cell harvesting, an aliquot (15 or 30 μL) of the cell suspensions
was mixed with Guava ViaCount reagent (final sample volume of 150
μL) and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After incubation,
samples were vortexed for 10 s. Cells were counted, and percent cell
viability was determined via manual analysis using a Guava EasyCyte
Mini Personal Cell Analyzer (PCA) and ViaCount software module. For
each sample, 1000 events were acquired with dilution factors that
were determined on the basis of the optimum machine performance (∼25–70
cells/μL). Instrument reproducibility was assessed daily using
GuavaCheck Beads and following the manufacturer’s suggested
protocol using the Daily Check software module.

Cellular Uptake
Studies
Cells (either T47D or MDA-MB-231)
were plated at 12 000 cells per well in a 48-well plate. Contrast
agents were dissolved in DMSO to obtain a stock solution of 100 mM.
An incubation solution of 0.125 mM contrast agent was made by diluting
the stock solution in the appropriate media (containing stripped FBS)
for each cell line (T47D and MDA-MB-231). Cells were incubated with
150 μL of the 0.125 mM solution for 1, 4, and 8 h. After incubation,
the media was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with 0.500
mL of DPBS and harvested by incubation with 50 μL of 0.25% TrypLE
for 10 min at 37 °C in a 5.0% CO2 incubator. Fifty
microliters of media was added to each well, a 30 μL aliquot
was removed for cell counting, and a 60 μL aliquot was analyzed
for Gd(III) content by ICP-MS. Each condition was done in triplicate.

Cytotoxicity: MTS Assay
The CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI)
was used to measure cell viability. Cells, either T47D or MDA-MB-231,
were plated at 500–1000 cells/well in 96–well plates
and maintained in media containing charcoal stripped serum for 48
h before the experiment. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen, 1, 2, 3, 4, and Gd(III)-DO3A were dissolved in DMSO
to make a stock solution of 100 mM. Solutions were diluted to the
experimental concentrations (10.0, 5.00, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.313,
0.156 mM) in media. After 48 h of incubation with 50 μL of solution,
the assay was run according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a Synergy4 microplate reader
(BioTek, Winooski, VT). Percent toxicity was calculated on the basis
of the absorbance.

Luciferase Assay for PR Activation
T47D cells were
grown in phenol red-free medium, and the cells were trypsinized and
plated in 24-well plate (50 000 cells/well). Incubation of
cells with pPRE-luciferase plasmid (100 ng/well, construct provided
by Dr. Ken Korach, NIEHS, NIH), RSV-β-galactosidase (100 ng/well,
provided by Dr. William T. Beck, University of Illinois at Chicago),
and Lipofectamine 2000 (1 μL per well, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) in Opti-MEM was performed overnight at 37 °C inside a humidified
incubator. The cells were treated with complexes 1–4 or controls for an additional 24 h.

To measure luciferase
production, cells were lysed in 100 μL of GME buffer [25 mM
glycylglycine (pH 7.8), 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol,
and 1% Triton X-100], and lysates were added to assay buffer (GME
buffer, 16.5 mM KPO4, 2.2 mM ATP, and 1.1 mM dithiothreitol). Luciferase
substrate was injected followed by a 30 s read by a FLUOstar OPTIMA
(BMG Lab Tech, Offenburg, Germany). LacZ activity (50 μL lysate)
was measured from cleavage of ONPG. The sample results were normalized
to β-galactosidase to account for transfection efficiency by
dividing the sum of the luciferase activity by the sum of the β-galactosidase
activity.

qPCR
T47D cells were plated at 300 000
cells/well
in 6–well plates in phenol red-free RPMI1640 media supplemented
with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% charcoal dextran stripped FBS. Twenty
four hours later, cells were washed once with 1× PBS and incubated
with contrast agents in DMSO or DMSO only in fresh phenol red-free
RPMI1640 media supplemented with 4.5 g/L glucose and 10% charcoal
dextran stripped FBS for 24 h. After treatment, cells were harvested
in 0.5 mL of Trizol, and RNA was extracted using the manufacturer’s
protocol. RNA was treated with DNaseI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA) for 10 min at 37 °C followed by inactivation at 75 °C
for 10 min. RNA samples (1 μg) were primed with random primers
(Promega, Madison, WI) and then reverse transcribed using Revertaid
Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) according to the
manufacture’s protocol. For PCR amplification, the cDNA was
diluted 1:10, and 1 μL was used in an 11 μL reaction using
FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix (ROX) (Roche) in a VIIA7
Real Time PCR System (Life Technologies) under the following conditions:
hold at 94 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C
for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The primers for ZBTB16 and GAPDH
were used at 0.5 μM and were the same as described. Induction of ZBTB16 was normalized to GAPDH,
and fold change was calculated using the ΔΔCt method.

Biodistribution
Animals were injected with 0.15 mmol/kg
body weight of 1. After an incubation of 6 or 24 h, organs
were harvested, and quantification of Gd(III) was performed using
ICP-MS of acid-digested samples. For organ digestion, Teflon tubes
were boiled in a mixture of ∼1–5% Alconox (w/v) and
3.0% (v/v) ACS reagent grade nitric acid (70%) to ensure complete
removal of lipid and residual Gd(III). The tubes were washed with
filtered, deionized H2O (18.2 MΩ·cm) and air-dried.
Organs were weighed in clean Teflon tubes followed by the addition
of 1 mL of ACS reagent grade nitric acid (70%) per gram of tissue.
Samples were digested in a Milestone EthosEZ microwave digestion system
(Shelton, CT, USA) with a 120 °C temperature ramp for 30 min
(600 W) and a 120 °C hold for 30 min (400 W), followed by a 45
min exhaust cycle. The resultant liquefied organ samples were weighed,
with a portion of each sample being placed in a clean preweighed 15
mL conical tube followed by addition of multielement internal standard
and filtered, deionized H2O (18.2 MΩ·cm) to
produce a final solution of 3.0% nitric acid (w/w) and 5 ng/mL multielement
internal standard containing Bi, Ho, In, Li, Sc, Tb, and Y (Inorganic
Ventures, Christiansburg, VA) and filtered, deionized H2O (18.2 MΩ·cm) to a final volume of 5 mL. Instrument calibration
was performed by preparing individual-element Gd(III)(III) standard
(Inorganic Ventures, Christiansburg, VA) using concentrations of 1.000,
5.000, 10.00, 20.00, 50.00, 100.0, and 200.0 ng/mL containing 3.0%
nitric acid (v/v) and 5.0 ng/mL of the multielement internal standard.

Tumor Xenograft Model
A 17β-estradiol pellet
(Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL, 70 day release, 0.72
mg/pellet) was implanted in the nape of the neck of athymic nude mice
due to their intrinsic low circulating estradiol levels. This pellet
ensures the growth of the estrogen-dependent T47D cells. Two days
later, T47D and MDA-MB-231 ((1–2) × 106) cells
were suspended in Matrigel (1:1 ratio by volume) and injected into
the rear flanks (MDA-MB-231 cells on the right and T47D on the left).
Mice were monitored for tumor growth every other day after inoculation.
Mice were imaged when tumors were palpable.

In Vivo MR Imaging
Xenografted nude mice (n = 2) were injected i.p.
with complex 1 at a concentration
of 0.15 mmol/kg mouse weight dissolved in buffered saline solution.
During imaging, mice were held under anesthesia (1–3% inhaled
isoflurane). Mice were allowed to regain consciousness and recover
in between imaging time points. Tubing containing heated water was
placed under the animals to maintain a constant body temperature.
All imaging experiments were performed on a 30 cm bore BioSpec 9.4
T MR imager fitted with 12 cm gradient inserts (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica,
MA) using a 40 mm quadrature volume coil.

Standard T1-weighted rapid acquisition rapid echo (RARE) scans were
used for imaging the xenografts. The parameters were as follows: TR
= 1500 ms, TE = 8.5 ms, flip angle = 180.0°, FOV = 3 cm, matrix
size = 256 × 256, slice thickness = 0.75 mm, and interslice distance
= 0.75 mm. Images were analyzed using the ImageJ software package.
Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated using the equation
CNR = (SItissue – SImuscle)/σnoise, where SItissue is the signal intensity in
the tissue of interest or tumor mass, SImuscle is the signal
intensity in the muscle, and σnoise is the standard
deviation of the noise. CNRs were averaged over two to three axial
slices in which the tumors were clearly visible.
