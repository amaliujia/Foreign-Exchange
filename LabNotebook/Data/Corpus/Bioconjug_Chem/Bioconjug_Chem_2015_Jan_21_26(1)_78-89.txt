We report in vitro and in vivo evaluation
of a newly designed trifunctional
theranostic agent for targeting solid tumors. This agent combines
a dendritic wedge with high boron content for boron neutron capture
therapy or boron MRI, a monomethine cyanine dye for visible-light
fluorescent imaging, and an integrin ligand for efficient tumor targeting.
We report photophysical properties of the new agent, its cellular
uptake and in vitro targeting properties. Using live animal imaging
and intravital microscopy (IVM) techniques, we observed a rapid accumulation
of the agent and its retention for a prolonged period of time (up
to 7 days) in fully established animal models of human melanoma and
murine mammary adenocarcinoma. This macromolecular theranostic agent
can be used for targeted delivery of high boron load into solid tumors
for future applications in boron neutron capture therapy.

Introduction
Molecular theranostics
is a novel and promising approach to tumor
targeting, where a single chemical entity combines diagnostic and
therapeutic modalities.1 Such an entity
could be assembled from individual therapeutic and diagnostic components,
such as cytotoxic, anti-growth, or pro-apoptotic agents and contrast
agents for MRI, visible-light, near-infrared, or other types of imaging.
Many biocompatible materials have been proposed to serve as a platform
for theranostics, including liposomes,2−6 dendrimers,7,8 polymers,9−13 and nanoparticles.10,14−23 To date, however, many such agents are nontargeted and rely on a
passive transvascular delivery into the solid tumors, resulting in
difficulties translating the efficacies found in vitro and in animal
models into the clinic. Therefore, development of targeted theranostics
capable of overcoming in vivo barriers for improved delivery and retention
within tumors is needed. Herein we report a trifunctional theranostic
agent designed such that its therapeutic and diagnostic modalities
are combined with tumor targeting via a high-affinity integrin ligand.

Our trifunctional theranostic agent DC-1 features
a nonpeptidic integrin ligand, a monomethine cyanine dye, and a carborane
dendritic wedge for BNCT (Figure 1). To combine
all three modalities in one construct, we utilized scaffold based
on l-lysine because it provides the necessary chemical functionalities
and biocompatibility. In parallel, the dendritic wedge DC-2, lacking the integrin binding functionality, was designed as a nontargeted
control (Figure 1). Figure 1 Structures of carboranyl
dendritic wedge DC-1 and
control DC-2.



Results and Discussion
Design and Synthesis of the Conjugates
After the assessment
of many available targeting strategies for tumor cells and vasculature,
we narrowed our choice to high-affinity, nonpeptidic ligand for αvβ3 integrins.24 Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate interactions
between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix.28 This diverse family consists of at least 18
α and 8 β subunits that can dimerize in 24 different combinations.29 At least 9 dimers are overexpressed in tumors
with αvβ3 receptors being found
in tumors and on vascular endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis
and are not typically found on quiescent cells.30,31 A nonpeptidic RGD-mimetic ligand was selected due to its high affinity
and selectivity toward αvβ3 receptors—its
mean inhibitory concentration in cell adhesion assays (IC50) is 40 nM for αvβ3, 5.5 μM
for αvβ5, and 2.1 μM for αIIbβ3 integrins.32

As an antitumor therapeutic modality, we decided to incorporate
a boron-rich moiety suitable for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).33−35 BNCT is a binary treatment that has shown a promising efficacy in
the recent treatment of inoperable neoplasms, especially in the locally
recurred head-and-neck cancers.36 It relies
on the ability of 10B nuclei to efficiently capture epithermal
neutrons and to undergo the subsequent decay, releasing high linear
energy transfer particles (most notably 4He and 7Li). These particles are highly cytotoxic yet confined to the cell
or cell vicinity where they have been generated, as their path length
is approximately equal to a cell diameter.37 For successful BNCT, three criteria must be met: (1) low systemic
toxicity and low uptake by the nontumor tissues with high tumor uptake
and tumor to normal tissues and tumor to blood ratios greater than
3:1;38 (2) 10B must be retained
in the tumor tissue but rapidly cleared from blood and normal tissues;
and (3) the concentration inside or near tumorigenic cells must be
≥109 of 10B atoms/cell (20–35
μg 10B/gram of tumor tissue).

In order to maximize
boron content per molecule, we chose dendritic
wedges built on a biocompatible scaffold that carries o-carboranes. Dendrimers39 are excellent
examples of the scaffolds that possess many useful properties, such
as high degree of branching, multivalency, well-defined molecular
weight, and biodegradability.40−48 Dendritic wedges49 are low molecular
weight polymeric molecules that share many similarities with dendrimers,
such as narrow polydispersity and reproducible pharmacokinetic behavior.
The cores of dendritic wedges are less obstructed by the branches
and provide a point of covalent functionalization for controlled derivatization
and incorporation into modular constructs.50 Despite the fact that dendritic wedges have smaller useful payload
“capacity” compared to dendrimers of the same architecture,
their structure provides for a more straightforward synthesis. Dendritic
wedges also allow control over solubility, molecular weight, and,
most importantly, multiplicity of therapeutic functionalities, which
makes them an ideal development platform for theranostic agents.

Polyhedral boranes, such as o-carborane,51,52 have high stability and high boron content, combined with the relative
ease of preparation and derivatization.53−55 To date, there have
been several reports of multiple polyhedral boranes conjugated to
macromolecular scaffolds such as dendrimers,56−65 making this type of chemistry particularly attractive for our purpose.
We chose tri-o-carboranyl pentaerythritol, whose
synthesis we previously reported,66 as
the building block of our dendritic wedge.

As a visible light
imaging modality, we chose monomethine cyanine
dye67 due to its ability to emit fluorescent
signal in the convenient for intravital microscopy 488–510
nm range, its photostability, and its straightforward coupling chemistry.68 In addition, structural versatility of an environmentally
sensitive monomethine cyanine group in such dyes allows for coverage
of a broad range of excitation and emission wavelengths.69,70 Such dyes typically have low fluorescence quantum yields in an aqueous
solution that increase in more viscous solution or when the dye conjugate
is bound to its target, primarily due to the restriction of the twisting
motions around the single bond of the methine group.69,70 This property allowed us to use cyan 40 as a local environment probe.

Syntheses of the targeted agent DC-1 and the nontargeted
conjugate DC-2 are shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme S1 (see Supporting Information). A modular approach was chosen, where the core of the conjugate (integrin ligand connected to
a linker) was synthesized first, followed by the attachment of other
modules to the branched linker, as it allows additional flexibility
in the type of the module. The carboxylic acid terminus of l-lysine was coupled to precursor 3 for attachment of
the linker 6 which, in turn, serves to conjugate a tricarboranyl
acid and the dye. First, the Boc group of the precursor 3 was removed and the resulting amine reacted with activated protected l-lysine 4 under standard peptide coupling conditions,
producing conjugate 5 in excellent yield.

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of DC-1
Subsequent deprotection of the α-amino group of
the l-lysine allowed for attachment of glutaric acid-based
linker 6 to give 7 in a nearly quantitative
yield. After
the deprotection step, the two tricarboranyl dendrons 8 were attached, and the following hydrogenation yielded the conjugate 9, featuring a free α-amino group. The addition of AcOH,
along with the use of Pd black as a catalyst, was crucial to the success
of the reduction. A cyanine dye precursor (10) was selected
based on its exclusive reactivity with primary amines via the ANRORC
mechanism,71 which is orthogonal to other
present functionalities. As expected, crude 9 reacted
cleanly with 10 to provide a trifunctional conjugate DC-1 in 25% yield and &gt;90% purity by HPLC. The identity
of
the conjugate was confirmed by the analysis of its 1H NMR
spectra and COSY as well as 1H-decoupled 11B
NMR spectrum that displayed the expected five signals characteristic
of the intact o-carboranes.72 The FT-ICR HRMS spectrum of DC-1 shows isotopic distribution
in excellent agreement with the predicted pattern (SI Figures S20 and S21).

Photophysical Properties
of DC-1 and DC-2
The UV–vis
absorption spectra of DC-1 and DC-2 in DMSO
and 9:1 v/v glycerol/DMSO are shown
in Figure 2A and C, respectively. Both compounds
showed similar spectra and the ratio of the intensities of the absorption
maxima was nearly 1:1 regardless of the buffer used. The fluorescence
emission intensity of conjugate DC-1 in DMSO is low as
compared to the emission in 9:1 v/v glycerol/DMSO mixture (Figure 2B). This is consistent with the low fluorescence
quantum yields previously reported for unsymmetrical monomethine cyanine
dyes, likely due to their twisting motions that rapidly deactivate
the excited state.73,74 In contrast, when DC-1 is dissolved in a glycerol/DMSO mixture, a 20-fold enhancement of
the fluorescence intensity is observed, presumably due to a slower
twisting motion of the dye in a more viscous solvent. A similar enhancement
in the fluorescence intensity was observed for DC-2 (Figure 2D). We also measured the excitation spectra for
both compound in DMSO and 9:1 v/v glycerol/DMSO with the emission
wavelength being fixed at 540 nm. A similar enhancement of the fluorescence
intensity was observed in the more viscous buffer (SI Figures S1 and S2).

Figure 2 Absorption (A) and fluorescence emission
(B) spectra of DC-1 in solution in DMSO (dashed line)
and in the more viscous medium
(9:1 v/v glycerol/DMSO, solid line), and absorption (C) and fluorescence
emission (D) spectra of DC-2 in DMSO (dashed line) and
in the same viscous medium. Emission spectra were recorded at λex = 450 nm.

Quantum yields of DC-1 and DC-2 were
measured for solutions in DMSO and the 9:1 v/v glycerol/DMSO mixture
using 5-carboxy fluorescein in 0.1 M aqueous NaOH as standard (quantum
yield 95%).75−77 Both DC-1 and DC-2 in DMSO
have low quantum yields of 1.5% and 1%, respectively (SI Figure S3). However, the quantum yield of DC-1 and DC-2 in a viscous medium increased nearly
30-fold to 52% for DC-1 and 29% for DC-2, respectively
(SI Figure S3).

In Vitro Stability Tests
A preliminary assessment of
the stability was conducted in PBS (pH = 7.4) at 10 μM concentration.
The conjugate DC-1 was incubated in PBS at 37 °C
for 2 and 24 h, followed by the analysis by the LC-MS. Under these
conditions we observed 98% and 85%, respectively, of the intact conjugate
remaining in the solution. Our earlier X-ray crystallographic studies
of the tricarboranyl pentaerythritol building block indicated that
the ester groups in DC-1 are hindered from the nucleophilic
attack by the steric bulk of the tricarboranyl pentaerythritol wedge.66 Similar results, indicating stability of DC-1, were obtained in DMEM and RPMI-1640 cell culture media.

Uptake of DC-1 and DC-2 by Live Cells
The uptake and intracellular localization of the targeted conjugate DC-1 and the control compound DC-2 in vitro was
studied in WM115 and MCF7 cell lines. The cells were incubated for
14–18 h in the presence of the compounds and imaged with laser-scanning
confocal microscope (LSCM). The resulting images are presented in
Figure 3. We found that at 37 °C DC-1 localized mainly on the cell membrane and in the lysosomes
of both cell lines due to the observed punctate staining, although
the extent of the localization was different for each cell line.

DIC image. Images in B–D were normalized to the highest fluorescence
intensity from image A. Scale bars: 20 μm.

Under the same conditions, control compound DC-2 showed
insignificant accumulation in WM115 cells (Figure 3E) and was also virtually undetectable in MCF7 cells (data
not shown). Both compounds remained completely extracellular when
incubated at 4 °C (Figure 3B,D). Both
conjugates did not exhibit cytotoxicity as determined by staining
with Sytox Orange for dead cells, observation of cell morphology,
and determination of the apoptosis rate by flow cytometry (vide infra).

To measure selectivity toward αvβ3 receptors in vitro, we performed blocking studies by first preincubating
WM115 cells with 10 μg/mL of either anti-αv or anti-β3 monoclonal antibodies, followed by coincubation
with DC-1 at two different concentrations (10 μM
and 25 μM). The results are summarized in Figure 4 and further detailed in SI Figure S5. The binding and internalization of DC1 was significantly
affected by the anti-αv and completely inhibited
by the anti-β3 mAb at both concentrations (Figure 4, panels B, C, E, F and SI Figure
S5, rows B, C, E, F). These results suggest that both αv and β3 integrin subunits play a key role
in the binding of DC-1 and its internalization. DC-2, as expected, did not bind or internalize regardless
of the presence of the antibodies (SI Figure S6).

and DC-1 (25 μM); (F) anti-β3 antibody
and DC-1 (25 μM). Antibody concentration: 10 μg/mL;
scale bars: 20 μm.

After observing an inhibition of uptake of DC-1 in
cells pretreated with antibodies, a competition experiment was performed,
in which each of the antibodies and DC-1 were added simultaneously
and coincubated for 3 h (see overlays in Figure 5 and full set of images in SI Figure S7). The compound DC-1 was added at three different concentrations
(5 μM, 10 μM, and 25 μM) along with either anti-αv or anti-β3 antibody at a concentration of
10 μg/mL. As illustrated in Figure 5B–C
and SI Figure S7, rows B–C, at 5
μM concentration of DC-1, very few cells coincubated
with anti-αv or anti-β3 antibodies
show any DC-1 binding and uptake. After the concentration
of DC-1 was increased to 10 μM, the amount of cells
with internalized compound increased to ∼50% of the total number
(Figure 5E,F and SI Figure
S7, rows E,F) as compared to the control (Figure 5D and SI Figure S7, row D). Finally,
at 25 μM concentration of DC-1 cells showed fluorescent
signal indicative of the compound competing with the antibody binding
(Figure 5G–I and SI Figure S7, rows G–I). Based on this competition
assay, we estimated an in vitro EC50 for DC-1 as ∼10 μM.

The data presented in Figures 4 and 5 and SI Figures S5 and S7 underscore the fact that while blocking
the αvβ3 integrins by preincubating
the cells with antibodies almost
totally suppresses the binding and uptake of DC-1, a
simultaneous addition of DC-1 and antibodies causes DC-1 to compete with binding of antibodies to αvβ3 integrins if DC-1 is present
at higher concentration.

a competition experiment

(5 μM, 10 μM, and 25 μM) was simultaneously added
and coincubated with anti-αv or anti-β3 antibody. Panels A–C: images of cells treated with
5 μM DC-1, 5 μM DC-1 with anti-αv antibody, or 5 μM DC-1 with anti-β3 antibody. Panels D–F: images of cells treated with
10 μM DC-1, 10 μM DC-1 with
anti-αv antibody, or 10 μM DC-1 with anti-β3 antibody. Panels G–I: images
of cells treated with 25 μM DC-1, 25 μM DC-1 with anti-αv antibody, or 25 μM DC-1 with anti-β3 antibody, respectively.
Scale bars: 20 μm.

To ascertain that DC-1 and DC-2 have
low cytotoxicity in the absence of epithermal neutrons, we measured
the rate of apoptosis by flow cytometry. In these experiments, WM115
cells were treated with either annexin V-PE (to detect an early apoptosis),
or 7-AAD, a late apoptosis marker. The populations of the cells that
spontaneously underwent early or late apoptosis (without treatment
with DC-1) were determined first (SI Figures S4D and S4G). They were subsequently subtracted
from the total populations of the apoptotic cells for the each group
treated with DC-1 (SI Figure S4E,F,
and Figure S4H,I). We observed an increase in the rate of early
apoptosis by 14%, for DC-1, and 4%, for DC-2. The rate of the late apoptosis increased by 13%, for DC-1, and by 1%, for DC-2 (standard deviations for this
type of assay are 1–1.5%; see SI Figure
S4). This suggests that in the absence of high flux of epithermal
neutrons the nontargeted agent DC-2 is essentially noncytotoxic
and targeted agent DC-1 induces apoptosis at a very low
rate.

In Vivo Imaging of Solid Tumor Targeting and Ex Vivo Biodistribution
Study of DC-1
To assess tumor targeting ability
of DC-1 in vivo, the T-cell deficient nude mice were
subcutaneously engrafted with WM115 cells, as described in the Experimental Section, and subsequently developed
tumors with the mean volume of ca. 350 mm3. We analyzed
the extent of tumor targeting by DC-1 relative to its
accumulation in several vital organs. Remarkably, the emission of
our cyanine dye was detectable in a broad range of wavelengths, reaching
well into the red and near-IR regions and making possible imaging
of its accumulation within the tumor and internal organs by the small
animal imager without any modifications. The broad emission spectrum
of the dye provided an opportunity to use several different excitation
and emission wavelength for in vivo imaging. Three excitation wavelengths
(λex = 465, 500, and 535 nm) gave satisfactory signal
in live animals at λem = 600–620 nm. In this
experiment, DC-1 at a dose of 5 mg/kg was injected into
the mice via a lateral tail vein. Fluorescence images obtained with
an excitation at 535 nm and emission was observed at 620 nm at specified
time points (Figure 6A) have shown the best
signal to noise ratio. Interestingly, DC-1 shows localization
in the tumor already 30 min after injection with the maximum signal
intensity being observed after 2 h. Furthermore, DC-1 showed retention in tumors with its fluorescence signal readily
detectable in the tumor even after 7 days. We also performed a simple
biodistribution study, where mice were injected via a lateral tail
vein with 5 mg/kg dose of DC-1 and after 2 h the animal
was sacrificed and the vital organs were collected. Imaging showed
a consistently higher degree of accumulation of DC-1 in
the tumor as compared to the other vital organs: lungs, heart, liver,
kidneys, and spleen (Figure 6B and Table 1).
The dissected organs could also be imaged at λex =
500/λem = 560 nm (SI Figure S8), due to the fact that the excitation light with the lower wavelength
is no longer absorbed by the animal’s skin and underlying tissues.
We observed the greatest accumulation of the conjugate in the tumor,
as expected. The liver and kidneys also showed an accumulation of DC-1, 3.1- and 3.7-fold lower than the tumor. The readily
detectable signal of the conjugate in the kidneys suggests them as
the likely primary organs through which the excretion of the conjugate
could occur. The achieved tumor-to-organ ratio of the accumulated
agent was greater than 3:1 in all imaged organs (Table 1) with the rest of the organs and body showing even
lower levels of the signal. These results underscore the potential
of DC-1 for BNCT. Further measurements of plasma half-life,
RES uptake, and other pharmacokinetic data are underway and will be
reported in due course.

time points after injection of DC-1. (B) Image of organs
shows fluorescent signals from the tumor, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys,
and spleen in the animal dissected 2 h after the injection.

In order to determine the uptake
and localization of our agents
in vivo in greater detail, we used intravital microscopy (IVM) imaging
of murine mammary adenocarcinoma in nude mice. This method offers
a remarkably detailed view of the tumor development, allowing dynamic,
high resolution, in vivo imaging of molecular, and cellular events.
Individual tissue cells can be imaged by standard light and fluorescence
microscopy such that many cellular events (e.g., cell migration, mitosis,
pyknosis, and apoptosis) and the growth and connectivity of blood
vessels can be readily quantified. IVM is especially powerful at imaging
dynamic changes, such as rapid flux of fluorescent probes across the
endothelial cell barrier, tumor uptake of fluorescent probes, changes
in blood flow, and tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

In
our IVM experiments, a titanium frame was placed onto the dorsal
skinfold of nude mice to sandwich the extended double layer of skin,
and the skin was carefully removed to expose the underlying muscle
and subcutaneous tissue, which was covered with another titanium frame
with a glass coverslip to form the window chamber. Tumor spheroids
that consisted of N202 cells (murine mammary carcinoma) were then
implanted into the tissue and allowed to vascularize and grow into
a tumor.27 After the tumor formation, the
conjugate DC-1 or the nontargeted compound DC-2 was injected via the tail vein at a dose of 2 mg/kg. The fluorescence
images were then recorded on specified days at the emission wavelength
of the dye incorporated into the constructs.

The IVM images
show the accumulation of DC-1 in the
tumor, as shown by the signal on Day 1 and its retention within the
tumor for 7 days (Figure 7). Interestingly,
the signal inside the tumor blood vessels was lower and contrasted
with the signal concentrating within the tumor interstitium even after
the first day past injection. This shows that DC-1 moved
across the leaky vascular wall of the subcutaneous tumors and accumulated
inside the tumors after being injected. The nontargeted DC-2 injected at the same dose did not show any detectable signal within
the tumors.

Figure 7 IVM images showing the uptake and retention of DC-1 in mouse subcutaneous tumor xenografts after injection at 2 mg/kg
on Day 0. A substantial amount of DC-1 is accumulated
in the tumor on Day 1 and is detectable for 7 days. The
black shadows in all images are tumor blood vessels. Scale bar: 100
μm.

Conclusions
We
designed, synthesized, and performed in vitro and in vivo assessment
of tumor targeting theranostic agent DC-1. This multifunctional
conjugate combines diagnostic (visible-light imaging) and therapeutic
(BNCT) modalities with tumor targeting through its ability to bind
αvβ3 integrins. As illustrated by
our competition experiments using anti-αv and anti-β3 antibodies, cellular uptake of DC-1 is dose-dependent
and can be significantly inhibited through a selective blockade of
the αvβ3 receptors. In our murine
subcutaneous tumor xenografts, DC-1 rapidly and specifically
accumulated in the solid tumors, as illustrated by live animal imaging
and ex vivo analysis of the compound biodistribution. Imaging experiments
using subcutaneous models showed rapid uptake, tumor to organs ratio
greater than 3:1, and a significant retention of DC-1 in the tumors for up to 7 days, providing a broad time window for
diagnostic and therapeutic use of the conjugate.

Targeted dendritic
wedges provide an attractive platform to transport
diagnostic and therapeutic modalities into tumors. Future efforts
will focus on biodistribution, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
analysis, and in vivo testing of the therapeutic efficacy of this
promising delivery platform in a range of tumor models. It is also
of particular interest to test the targeting strategy described herein
in patient-derived primary tumors where physical barriers, such as
microvascular wall, could pose challenges for the delivery of therapeutic
agents from the circulating blood across the vascular endothelial
barrier.

Experimental Procedures
General
All reagents and solvents
were obtained from
commercial sources and were used as received unless otherwise stated.
Dry THF was obtained by distillation with sodium and benzophenone.
Dry CH2Cl2 was freshly distilled with calcium
hydride. All reactions involving moisture-sensitive reagents were
conducted under argon atmosphere with anhydrous solvents and flame-dried
glassware. Hygroscopic liquids were transferred via a syringe and
were introduced into reaction vessels through rubber septa. Reaction
product solutions were concentrated using a rotary evaporator at 30–150
mmHg. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (230–400
mesh) using reagent grade solvents as eluents. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed on glass-backed, pre-coated plates
(0.25 mm, silica gel 60, F-254, EM Science). Preparatory HPLC purifications
were carried out on C8 reverse phase preparative column
(Alltech/Grace Davison) using the flow rate of either 4 or 5 mL/min.
In all cases, various gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) were used as eluents. Water (18 MΩ) was obtained
from a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system, and all buffers
were filtered through 0.2 μm nylon filter immediately before
use. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained on Varian
400 or Bruker 500 MHz instruments in the indicated solvents. The peak
positions are reported with chemical shifts (δ) in parts per
million (ppm) downfield from the signal for tetramethylsilane (0 ppm)
and referenced to the signal resulting from the incomplete deuteration
of a solvent used in the experiment (CDCl3: 7.26 ppm, or
the center line of the multiplet of DMSO-d6: 2.50 ppm). Carbon-13 chemical shifts are reported as δ values
in ppm and referenced to the cabon-13 signal of a solvent used in
the experiment (CDCl3: 77.0 ppm, or the center line of
the multiplet DMSO-d6: 39.51 ppm). The
following abbreviations are used: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet
(t), doublet of doublets (dd), multiplet (m). UV–vis absorption
spectra were measured on Beckman DU-800 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence
emission spectra were measured using Horiba Fluorolog spectrofluorometer.
Mass spectra were obtained with Thermo Finnigan LCQ or Agilent 6200
Series Accurate-Mass Time-of-Flight (TOF) LCMS instruments, School
of Pharmacy, University of Southern California and Bruker IonSpec
4.7T ESI FT-ICR mass spectrometer at the University of Arizona, Tucson.
Compound 3 was prepared by a procedure analogous to that
described in the literature.24

Conjugate 5 (Scheme 1)
Neat TFA (3 mL)
was added to a solution of 3 (30 mg,
0.047 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3 mL). The resulting
solution was stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. Then, the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resulting deprotected
amine was dissolved in a mixture of DMF (1 mL) and DIEA (42 μL,
0.234 mmol). Separately, Nε-Cbz-Nα-Boc-l-lysine (4, 18 mg, 0.047 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (1 mL), followed by the
addition of HBTU (30 mg, 0.072 mmol) and DIEA (42 μL, 0.234
mmol). After stirring for 10 min, this mixture was added dropwise
to the deprotected amine and the reaction mixture was stirred for
2 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue
was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CH2Cl2/MeOH (95:5)) to yield 5 (40 mg, 95%) as a colorless,
glass-like solid. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ

Neat TFA (2 mL) was
added to a solution of 7 (18 mg, 0.015 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (2 mL). The resulting solution was stirred
for 30 min at ambient temperature. Then, the solvent was removed under
reduced pressure and the resulting deprotected amine was dissolved
in a mixture of DMF (0.5 mL) and DIEA (7 μL, 0.045 mmol). Separately,
the carborane dendritic wedge 8 (21 mg, 0.030 mmol) was
dissolved in DMF (0.5 mL), followed by the addition of HBTU (14 mg,

reaction was complete, solvent was removed under reduced pressure
and the residue was dissolved in EtOH (2 mL), followed by the addition
of AcOH (25 μL) and Pd black (10 mg). The vial was purged with
H2, and the solution was stirred under an H2 atmosphere for 3 h. The solids were filtered off, and the filtrate
was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain compound 9, which was dissolved in DMF (1 mL), followed by the addition of
DIEA (7 μL, 0.042 mmol) and dye 10 (5.0 mg, 0.016

Quantum Yield Measurements
To determine quantum yields
for DC-1 and DC-2, 20 μM stock solutions
of both compounds were prepared in nonviscous (neat DMSO) and viscous
(9/1 v/v glycerol/DMSO) solvents. The stock solutions were prepared
using the respective solvents in order to achieve the absorption of
0.1 at 450 nm. These solutions were subjected to further serial dilutions,
and the absorption spectra of the diluted solutions were measured.
Fluorescence emission spectra of the same solutions were measured
at λex = 450 nm. The integrated fluorescence intensities
were calculated from the fluorescnce emission spectra by measuring
the area under the curve. The absorption of each sample at 450 nm
was plotted against the integrated fluorescence intensity for that
sample (SI Figure S3). A simple linear
regression was obtained from the data and the gradient was calculated.
Using the above-mentioned procedure, a reference plot of absorption
at 450 nm vs the integrated fluorescnce intensity was also made and
the gradient was calculated for the known standard (5-carboxyfluorescein
in 0.1 M NaOH, quantum yield 95%). The formula used to calculate the
quantum yields of DC-1 and DC-2 is shown
in the SI Figure S3.

Cell Lines
Human breast carcinoma (MCF7) and human
melanoma (WM115) cell were obtained from ATCC (accession numbers HTB-22
and CRL-1675). Murine mammary adenocarcinoma N202 was a gift from
Joseph Lustgarten, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ.

Cell Culture
MCF7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific),
penicillin (50 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 μg/mL). WM115 cells
were grown in α-MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (50 U/mL), and streptomycin (50 μg/mL). MCF7
and WM115 were passaged after they became 90% confluent using 1% Trypsin
for MCF7 cells and 1× Accutase (Sigma) for WM115 cells. All cells
were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. N202 cells were maintained in DMEM High Glucose supplemented
with l-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin
(100 U/mL), sodium pyruvate (1 mM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and
10% heat inactivated FBS (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA). All cells
were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cell growth and morphology were monitored by phase-contrast
microscopy.

Flow Cytometry
WM115 cells were
plated in a 25 mL cell
culture flask. After 48 h cells were harvested with Accutase (Sigma)
and resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Next, 100 μL of cell suspension was incubated at
37 °C for 4 h with DC-1 (25 μM) in α-MEM
medium with 1% DMSO in a culture tube. Cells were centrifuged at 500×g and washed with ice-cold PBS. To the cells was added 5
μL of Annexin V-PE or 5 μL of 7-AAD for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark followed by the addition of 400 μL of
binding buffer. For control experiments, cells were incubated with
Annexin V-PE or 7-AAD only in α-MEM medium with 1% DMSO. After
incubation, the cells were analyzed by a BD LSR II flow cytometer
and fluorescence emitted was collected in three optical channels as
indicated in Table S1.

Confocal Microscopy
In our laser-scaning confocal microscopy
(LSCM) experiments, Mat Tek 35-mm-diameter dishes with 14 mm glass
bottom were used. A general method for confocal microscopy consisted
of plating 30 000 cells, MCF7 or WM115 in glass bottom dish
with 300 μL RPMI medium and α-MEM medium for MCF7 and
WM115 cell lines, respectively. Both media were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. After 24 h the dishes with cells were treated
with compounds DC-1 and DC-2 at desired
concentration in their media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and DMSO at 1% v/v. The cells were incubated with compounds for desired
length of time. In general, incubation time given to cells treated
with DC-1 and DC-2 was 14 h at 37 °C
at 5% CO2. For 4 °C experiments, a 2 h incubation
was performed in a plastic wrap to avoid evaporation of the cell culture
media. Zeiss LSM510 META Confocal Imaging System equipped with oil-immersion
objectives for 40× or 63× magnification was used. Argon
488 nm laser was used for imaging with emission filters of BP 500–550
IR.

Blocking Experiments with Antibodies
For antibody blocking
experiments, WM115 cells were harvested with Accutase (Sigma) and
plated on Mat Tek 35-mm-diameter dishes with 14 mm glass bottom. After
48 h of incubation of the plated cells, they were treated with either
anti-αv (10 μg/mL) or anti-β3 (10 μg/mL) antibodies (Millipore) in α-MEM medium with
1% DMSO for 1 h. Next, DC-1 or DC-2 at a
desired concentration was added to the medium and the cells were coincubated
with DC-1 or DC-2 and the antibodies for
2 h. Cells were washed with cold PBS and treated with secondary antibody
for 0.5 h at room temperature in the dark followed by two washes with
ice-cold PBS. In order to detect anti-αv antibody,
cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated with the secondary
antibody, Alexa Fluor 594–goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen)
at a 10 μg/mL concentration for 30 min, then washed with ice-cold
PBS immediately before imaging. Similarly, Alexa Fluor 350 goat anti-mouse
IgM (μ chain, 10 μg/mL, Invitrogen) has been used for
detection of anti-β3 primary antibody.

For
antibody competition experiments, WM115 cells were harvested with
Accutase (Sigma) and plated on Mat Tek 35-mm-diameter dishes with
14 mm glass bottom. After 48 h of incubation of the plated cells,
they were coincubated with desired concentration of DC-1 or DC-2 and with either anti-αv (10
μg/mL) or anti-β3 (10 μg/mL) antibodies
(Millipore) in α-MEM medium with 1% DMSO for 3 h. Cells were
washed with cold PBS and imaged.

Zeiss LSM510 META confocal
microscope equipped with oil-immersion
objectives for 40× or 63× magnification was used. Argon
488 nm laser was used for imaging DC-1 and DC-2, 543 nm laser was used for imaging Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibody,
and 790 nm laser was used for two photon excitation of Alexa Fluor
350 secondary antibody. Emission filters used were BP 500–550
IR, BP 565–615 IR, and Track ChS1:362–704 for green,
red, and blue channels, respectively.

Animal Use
Animal
experiments were done in accordance
with federal guidelines following review and approval by the Proteogenomics
Research Institute for Systems Medicine Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (PRISM IACUC) and University of Southern California
IACUC. Athymic nude mice were 8–9 weeks old and purchased from
Harlan or Taconic.

Tumor Models
The athymic nude mice
were anesthetized
(3% isoflurane) and WM115 cells, 5 million cells per site in 50 μL
αMEM medium and 50 μL BD Matrigel, were injected subcutaneously
into the lower dorsal right flank in five mice. Mice developed medium-sized
(350 mm3) subcutaneous tumor on the ventral left side of
the mice after 4 weeks of injection.

Imaging of Live Mice
The mice with a ventral side subcutaneous
tumor (350 mm3 size) were anesthetized (3% isoflurane).
A solution of DC-1 was injected intravenously via lateral
tail vein at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Xenogen IVIS 200 instrument was used
for the imaging. Images were taken after an interval of 30 min, 2
h, and 7 days after injecting DC-1 at excitation wavelength
of 535 nm and measuring emission at 620 nm. For the biodistribution
study, DC-1 was injected at a dose of 5 mg/kg via tail
vein, the animal was euthanized after 2 h, and dissection was performed
to collect the organs. The collected organs were immediately imaged
at λex = 500 nm/λem = 560 nm and
at λex = 535 nm/λem = 620 nm.

Intravital Microscopy Imaging
We used a classical IVM
tumor model with minor modifications.26 The mice, athymic nude mice (25–30 g body weight), were anesthetized
(7.3 mg ketamine hydrochloride and 2.3 mg xylazine per 100 g body
weight, intraperitoneal injection) and placed on a heating pad. A
titanium frame was placed onto the dorsal skinfold of mice to sandwich
the extended double layer of skin. A 15-mm-diameter full-thickness
circular layer of skin was then excised. The superficial fascia on
top of the remaining skin is carefully removed to expose the underlying
muscle and subcutaneous tissue which is then covered with another
titanium frame with a glass coverslip to form the window chamber.
After a recovery period of 1–2 days, the animals were prepared
for the procedure of implanting of tumor spheroids.

Tumor spheroids
were formed by plating 50 000 N202 cells onto 1% agar-coated
96-well non-tissue culture treated flat bottom dishes (20 μL
cells in 100 μL medium) and centrifuging 4 times at 2000 rpm
for 15 min, rotating the dish after every centrifugation. The cells
were incubated an additional 3–7 days (depending on cell type)
at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in air to form tight tumor spheroids.
The spheroids were implanted directly onto the dorsal skin in the
window chamber alone. Tumors were allowed to vascularize over 10–14
days before the injection of 1 mg/kg of either DC-1 or DC-2 on Day 0.

Tumor Growth
Tumors were imaged
via intravital fluorescence
microscopy, as described in the literature.27 The amount of integrin ligand retention in tumors was analyzed from
the recorded grayscale 0-to-256 levels of gray images using Image-Pro
Plus (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD). Intravital fluorescence microscopy
was done on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 to analyze the amount of DC-1 and DC-2 present in the tumors.
