Control of small molecule hapten
epitope densities on antigenic
carrier proteins is essential for development and testing of optimal
conditions for vaccines. Yet, accurate determination of epitope density
can be extremely difficult to accomplish, especially with the use
of small haptens, large molecular weight carrier proteins, and limited
amounts of protein. Here we report a simple radiometric method that
uses 14C-labeled cystine to measure hapten epitope densities
during sulfhydryl conjugation of haptens to maleimide activated carrier
proteins. The method was developed using a (+)-methamphetamine (METH)-like
hapten with a sulfhydryl terminus, and two prototype maleimide activated
carrier proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and immunocyanin monomers
of keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The method was validated by immunochemical
analysis of the hapten–BSA conjugates, and least-squares linear
regression analysis of epitope density values determined by the new
radiometric method versus values determined by matrix-assisted laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Results showed that radiometric
epitope density values correlated extremely well with the mass spectrometrically
derived values (r2 = 0.98, y = 0.98x + 0.91). This convenient and simple method
could be useful during several stages of vaccine development including
the optimization and monitoring of conditions for hapten–protein
conjugations, and choosing the most effective epitope densities for
conjugate vaccines.

To generate
high affinity antibodies
against small molecular weight chemicals and peptides (e.g., &lt;1000
Da molecular weight), multiple
copies of a hapten must be covalently attached to a suitable antigenic
carrier protein to form a vaccine. The degree of haptenation (or epitope
density) can influence both the affinity and titer of the resulting
antibody immune response.1 However, the
accurate measurement and optimization of epitope density is a critical
and sometimes underappreciated aspect of vaccine development.

Two commonly used approaches for hapten–protein conjugation
reactions are formation of a carboxamide2 bond between the hapten and a reactive terminal amino group of the
carrier protein, or a thioether bond between the hapten and a maleimide
activated protein.3,4 While the carboxamide chemistry
is straightforward,2 it is often difficult
to achieve reproducible high levels of epitope densities on proteins
(e.g., &gt;10 per bovine serum albumin [BSA] molecule),5 whereas with sulfhydryl chemistry it is relatively
easy
to achieve high epitope densities with maleimide activated proteins.4

In the process of developing an anti-methamphetamine
(METH) vaccine,
we realized the critical need to develop an inexpensive, rapid method
for accurate quantitation of the epitope density on both small and
large proteins. The colorimetric method of Ellman6 is perhaps the most often used procedure for determining
the number of sulfhydryl groups available for conjugation. However,
the technique does not work well with all hapten–protein combinations
or with very small-scale conjugation reactions where the amount of
protein or antigenic carrier is a limiting factor. Chemical modification
of the carrier proteins to allow direct conjugation of more haptens
also adds to the complexity of the analysis. For smaller, commonly
used carrier proteins (&lt;100 kDa) such as ovalbumin, BSA, and thyroglobulin
(TG), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF) is an accurate and reliable analytical method.5,7−9

Characterization of hapten–protein conjugates
is especially
difficult to achieve with large molecular weight proteins (e.g., &gt;100
kDa) and very small haptens (e.g., &lt;300 Da). For these larger carrier
proteins and dimers (like ICKLH) or multimers, accurate
determination of mass can sometimes be best accomplished with radiolabeled
haptens or with very advanced mass spectrometry systems. Both techniques
are costly and not feasible for most laboratories.

We report
here the utility and validation of a simple radiochemical
method for accurate quantitation of sulfhydryl hapten conjugations
to maleimide activated proteins. The method uses 14C-cystine
and the reduced form, 14C-cysteine (14C-Cys),
as a tracer and maleimide activated carrier protein. To determine
the feasibility of this analytical method we conjugated the METH-hapten
SSMO9-METH [(S)-N-(2-(mercaptoethyl)-6-(3-(2-(methylamino)propyl)phenoxy)hexanamide]
to BSA (Figure 1) and used MALDI-TOF as a reference
method to validate our results. We have previously published the synthesis
of HSMO9,4 and will publish the synthesis
of SSMO9-METH in a future publication.

Figure 1 METH conjugate vaccine
synthesis overview. The available lysine
groups on a protein (BSA or ICKLH) were “activated”
with the cross-linker sulfo-SMCC in preparation for “conjugation”;
for simplicity, only a single lysine terminal group is shown (*).
Just prior to the conjugation step, TCEP is used as a reducing agent
for the conversion of SSMO9 dimer to HSMO9 monomer. Starting with
the dimer allows for just in time reduction of the highly reactive
HSMO9 hapten. In the final step of the reaction, SMO9 is “conjugated”
to the activated BSA or ICKLH to form the METH-conjugate
vaccine (labeled Protein-SMO9). After conjugation was complete, any
unreacted maleimide groups of the BSA-SMO9 or ICKLH-SMO9
vaccine were blocked or end-capped by the addition of a 4-fold excess
of cysteine. This step was a precaution to prevent any potential chemical
reactions of the vaccine with proteins in vivo.

We also tested the method for use in the development of anti-METH
vaccine using maleimide activated Immunocyanin (ICKLH;
Biosyn Corp., Carlsbad, CA) as the carrier protein (Figure 1). ICKLH is a large molecular weight
protein derived from the native Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; 8000
to 32 000 kDa), which consists of two stable subunit monomers
with masses of ∼360 and ∼390 kDa, with abundant lysine
residues for hapten linkage.4,5,10,11 Relative to native KLH, ICKLH is a more uniform antigenic carrier that is used in human
vaccine clinical trials.12,13 This ICKLH-SMO9 conjugate vaccine is in preclinical development for the potential
treatment of METH addiction.4

SSMO9
(Figure 1) is a new dimeric precursor
of the METH-like hapten HSMO9 (hereafter referred to as the deprotonated
SMO9), used for conjugation to ICKLH,4 which is simpler to synthesize, does not require protection
of the single SMO9 sulfhydryl group from degradation, and does not
use mercuric acetate in the synthesis process. The elimination of
possible mercury carryover in the reaction is a critical improvement
for a potential human vaccine. In addition, the S–S dimer form
of haptens can stabilize the labile SH group and protect it from unwanted
side reactions during synthesis.14 This
can also improve the storage stability and quality of sulfhydryl-containing
haptens. The reduced form of this hapten, SMO9, was directly conjugated
to the maleimide activated BSA or ICKLH (Figure 1). The activation, reduction, and conjugation reactions
for the radiometric and MALDI-TOF analysis experiments as well as
for vaccine production were performed similarly and are described
in Supporting Information.

To characterize
the maleimide activated proteins and confirm the
conjugation of SMO9 to the activated protein, SMO9–activated
BSA conjugates were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis
(Figure 2A and B). SMO9–activated ICKLH conjugates were evaluated using an agarose gel system and
Western blot (Figure 2C and D). Activation
of both BSA (Figure 2A, lane 3) and ICKLH (Figure 2C, lane 2) resulted in
the formation of large molecular weight protein bands that did not
react with an anti-METH antibody upon Western blot analysis (Figure 2B, lane 3 and Figure 2D,
lane 2), but did react with the anti-METH antibody when the activated
proteins were conjugated with SMO9 (Figure 2B, lanes 4–7 and Figure 2D, lane 3).
This confirmed the coupling of the SMO9 hapten to the various forms
of the activated proteins.

For the 14C-Cys radiometric analyses of BSA–hapten
conjugations, we determined both the incorporation of 14C-Cys tracers in the presence of large amounts of SMO9 (SMO9-equivalents,
a competitive reaction for protein conjugation sites), and the incorporation
of the 14C-Cys tracers in the presence of unlabeled cysteine
(reported as 14C-Cys-equivalents, a noncompetitive reaction).
We hypothesized that parallel measurement of the incorporation of 14C-Cys-equivalents, conducted at the same time as SMO9 protein
conjugation reactions, would be the most accurate predictor of SMO9-protein
epitope density. It was not clear if 14C-Cys in the presence
of large amounts of SMO9 would accurately predict epitope density,
since the two molecules differed in structure and chemical properties.
This could result in different rates for the completion of forming
covalent bounds with the protein, and thereby produce an over or under
estimation of the true SMO9 epitope density on the proteins.

To test this hypothesis we conducted three parallel conjugation
reactions: (1) SMO9 with a 14C-Cys tracer, (2) unlabeled
cysteine with a 14C-Cys tracer, and (3) SMO9 alone with
a range of BSA:hapten ratios (1:10, 1:15, 1:20, and 1:30). The hapten
epitope density of SMO9 alone (3) was determined by MALDI-TOF analysis,
as described previously.4 This was deemed
our reference method for assay validation. The samples containing 14C-Cys were quantitated by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry.
Although the amount of the tracer radioligand bound to the protein
was relatively low, we were able to use this incorporation of 14C-Cys as a relative measure of the amount of conjugation
of unlabeled cysteine or SMO9.

Since the values for coefficients
of determination (r2) were near 1.0 (Figure 3A), both
the noncompetitive and competitive radiometric assays showed a strong
linear relationship throughout the range of BSA:hapten ratios. This
indicated that the available maleimide groups did not reach saturation
in either assay, but the differences in slopes between the noncompetitive
and competitive radiometric assays (0.54 vs 0.35, respectively) suggested
there was unequal competition for the covalent binding of 14C-Cys and SMO9.

Figure 3 (A) Linear regression analysis of the number of epitopes
incorporated
in the radiometric assays (SMO9 with a 14C-Cys tracer:
open symbol; and unlabeled cysteine with a 14C-Cys tracer:
closed symbol) versus the ratio of SMO9 hapten to maleimide activated
BSA. (B) Relationship between the predicted number of epitopes by
the 14C-Cys radiometric assays and the number of observed
SMO9 epitopes by MALDI-TOF analysis. As judged by linear regression
analysis, there was an excellent correlation between predicted and
observed values in the cysteine and 14C-Cys assay, but
the SMO9 and 14C-Cys analysis significantly underpredicted
the true number of SMO9 epitopes.

The epitope density values predicted from the two radiochemical
assays in Figure 3A were then correlated with
the direct MALDI-TOF measurements of SMO9 epitope density values using
linear regression analysis (Figure 3B). Calculation
of SMO9-equivalents based on the competitive SMO9-14C-Cys
tracer assay indicated that this method underestimated the SMO9 epitope
densities compared to the MALDI-TOF analysis of SMO9 epitopes (slope
= 0.64, r2 = 0.94; Figure 3B). The measurement of epitope densities as 14C-Cys-equivalents
in the noncompetitive assay proved to be the accurate measurement
of SMO9 hapten incorporation based on the excellent values for the
slope, y-intercept, and coefficient of determination
(slope = 0.98, r2 = 0.99; Figure 3B). Using this new method we also determined the
average SMO9 hapten density on the ICKLH dimers shown in
Figure 2C and D was 14 haptens per ICKLH.

These findings suggest that under these (noncompetitive)
reaction
conditions both ligands are able to achieve the same maximal binding,
but perhaps at a different rate. This positive result was aided by
the fact that we carefully optimized each of the reactions to allow
maximal binding, which resulted in the same final epitope densities
for each ligand.

This simple and versatile radiometric method
for determining the
extent of hapten–protein conjugation with sulfhydryl linkages
could potentially be broadly useful in determining the epitope density
of therapeutic vaccines (for treating drug abuse or other medical
or veterinary purposes), antibody–drug conjugates, antibody–nanoparticle
conjugate, and other protein conjugations. However, further testing
and validation of the method with other hapten and protein combinations
will ultimately determine the broader applicability and accuracy of
the method.

Even if the analysis of a carrier protein conjugate
is feasible
by mass spectrometry or colorimetric assays, this relatively quick
method has advantages because it is inexpensive compared to mass spectrometry,
does not require radioactive haptens, can be used for measurements
of very large and complex proteins (e.g., ICKLH is a dimer),
and, unlike protein colorimetric methods, only requires microgram
quantities of protein. These advantages could be useful during the
optimization and monitoring of conditions for hapten–protein
conjugations, and choosing the most effective epitope densities for
conjugate vaccines.
