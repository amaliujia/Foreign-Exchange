Introduction
The ability to track
cells in vivo will facilitate
applications such as detection of tissue rejection, fate mapping of transplanted stem cells,− and early detection
of cancer. MR imaging is ideally suited
for long-term cell tracking since it is noninvasive, possesses high
spatial resolution and unlimited penetration depth, and provides tomographic
information without the use of ionizing radiation. Intrinsic MR image contrast is enhanced using paramagnetic
contrast agents, typically iron oxide nanoparticles or Gd(III) complexes. Iron oxide nanoparticles generate contrast by
reducing the transverse relaxation time (T2) of surrounding water protons thereby producing negative (dark)
image contrast. Gd(III) contrast agents decrease the proton spin–lattice
relaxation time (T1) of surrounding water
protons and generate positive (bright) image contrast. Few examples of cell tracking with Gd(III) contrast agents
exist in the literature because these agents usually efflux rapidly
from cells prohibiting long-term imaging studies.,−

For long-term imaging and tracking of cells
using Gd(III)-based
contrast agents it is necessary to develop probes that effectively
label and are retained by cells. Clinically approved Gd(III)-based
MR agents (such as Magnevist and Prohance) are largely confined to
the extracellular space and require high incubation concentrations
and long incubation times for cellular internalization. Attempts to
increase agent permeability have included conjugating Gd(III) complexes
to cell penetrating peptides,− nanoparticles,− polymers, and small molecules. While these labeling
strategies improve agent uptake, rapid cellular efflux leads to significant
reduction of intracellular Gd(III) resulting in decreased MR image
contrast, thereby prohibiting long-term longitudinal imaging studies. Furthermore, internalized agents are typically
compartmentalized in endosomes that can lead to relaxivity quenching
and contrast agent degradation.,

Our strategy
to overcome these challenges is the development of
cell membrane-anchored contrast agents that label cells without the
need for cellular internalization. Li et al. reported a membrane-anchored
MR contrast agent that labels cell at low incubation concentrations
with long-term imaging potential. Their
strategy (modeled after lipophilic fluorescent dyes such as DiI and
DiO) involves conjugating alkyl chains to a Gd(III) complex to serve
as anchors in the cell membrane. Several alternative strategies for
synthesizing lipophilic contrast agents with alkyl chains have been
developed; however, these agents have only been used to investigate
relaxometric properties and have not been tested in vitro.−

We propose the further development of lipophilic MR contrast
agents
using multimeric cyclen-based chelates to increase Gd(III) payload
and therefore amplify MR signal. We have previously reported the synthesis
of a multimeric MR contrast agent that uses copper(I)-catalyzed azide
alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) “click” chemistry to attach
azide modified chelates to an alkyne modified scaffold. This strategy generates rigid triazole linkages
that have been shown to hinder the local rotation of Gd(III) complexes
and enhance relaxivity. Herein, we modify
this scaffold to include lipophilic alkyl chains to generate a series
of contrast agents that label the cell membrane with increased labeling
efficiency, retention, and MR image contrast compared to nonlipophilic
monomeric Gd(III) contrast agents (Prohance and an azide-modified
Gd(III) complex, 4).

Results and Discussion
Previously, we have described a strategy to generate high-relaxivity,
multimeric MR contrast agents with “click” chemistry
using a phenol-based scaffold functionalized with three alkyne groups. The resultant agents are synthesized from this
scaffold by attaching an azide modified Gd(III) complex (4) where the observed relaxivity increases 5-fold when attached to
the scaffold. Here, we describe conjugating alky chains to this scaffold
to generate cell membrane-anchored MR contrast agents (Figure ).

Three lipophilic and two nonlipophilic contrast agents
are described. 1 and 2 are multimeric MR
contrast agents that
contain three Gd(III) chelates while 3, 4, and Prohance are monomeric complexes. 4 and Prohance
were selected as controls because they accumulate in the cytosol whereas
the lipophilic agents label the cell membrane.

Synthesis and Characterization of Multimeric Complexes
Multimeric
lipophilic agents were synthesized according to Scheme . Alkyl chains were attached to 2,4,6-tribromophenol
via a Mitsunobu reaction followed by a Sonogashira reaction to introduce
the TMS-protected alkyne groups. TMS deprotection was carried out
using potassium fluoride and the final product was obtained by conjugating 4 onto the scaffold via “click” chemistry in
1:1 DCM:MeOH with CuI and TBTA. Two complexes were synthesized using
this procedure: the first with a 14 carbon single alkyl chain (1) and the second with two alkyl chains of 10 and 14 carbon
units (2).

Synthesis of Multimeric Lipophilic Contrast
Agents That Contain a
Single or Double Alkyl Chain
Agents were synthesized with
“click” chemistry and contain three Gd(III) chelates.
The resultant complexes have limited water solubility and were solubilized
in 4 mM cholate.

The resultant agents have
limited water solubility prohibiting
accurate relaxivity measurements. Therefore, 1 and 2 were solubilized in the detergent sodium cholate hydrate
(4 mM) to increase solubility 25-fold from 28 μM (in 10% DMSO)
to 700 μM. Relaxivity was measured in 4 mM cholate at 1.41 and
7 T, where the ionic relaxivities (r1)
of 1 and 2 were 16.5 ± 0.1 mM–1 s–1 and 17.4 ± 1.3 mM–1 s–1 at 1.41 T, respectively (Table ), and decrease to 4.00 ± 0.15 mM–1 s–1 for 1 and 4.86 ± 0.19 mM–1 s–1 for 2 at 7 T (). These relaxivities are consistent
with those obtained from a previously reported contrast agent that
was synthesized from a similar scaffold (15.4 ± 0.8 mM–1 s–1 at 1.41 T).

Synthesis and
Characterization of Water-Soluble Lipophilic Complex
To increase
water solubility we prepared a monomeric lipophilic
contrast agent (Scheme ). Specifically, 1-azidotetradecane
was reacted with an alkyne modified chelate (12) in 2:1
tBuOH:H2O with CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate to
afford the final product (3).

Synthesis of Monomeric
Lipophilic Contrast Agent 3 Prepared
with “Click”Chemistry
The agent is soluble in water
and 4 mM cholate.

The relaxivity of the resultant
agent was measured in water (17.6
± 0.7 mM–1 s–1 at 1.41 T,
4.32 ± 0.10 mM–1 s–1 at 7
T) and 4 mM cholate (16.4 ± 2.9 7 mM–1 s–1 at 1.41 T, 5.57 ± 0.12 mM–1 s–1 at 7 T) (Table , ). These values are approximately 6-fold
higher at 1.41 T and 2-fold higher at 7 T than the relaxivity of 12 which can be attributed to contrast agent aggregation.

Lipophilic Contrast Agents Form Micelles
and Liposomes in Solution
The extent of agent aggregation
and the effect of cholate on micelle
formation were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The
data show that under the conditions measured complexes 1, 2, and 3 form micelles with a size distribution
of 6 ± 3 nm. Additionally, 1 and 2 form
a marginal population (≪0.1%) of liposomes 50–200 nm
in size (Table ). Conversely, the control
solutions of water, 4 mM cholate, 4 in water and cholate,
and Prohance in water and cholate do not form light-scattering structures
(). These data suggest that
the use of cholate (required for solubilization of 1 and 2) does not significantly alter micelle formation or size
distribution.

Cell Labeling and Toxicity
of Lipophilic Contrast Agents
In order to optimize cell labeling,
the incubation conditions of 1–4 and
Prohance in HeLa cells were determined
by quantifying toxicity (), nonspecific binding (), and the effects of cholate () and incubation time on cell labeling
(). Based on these data, all
incubations were prepared in 0.4 mM cholate for 24 h at concentrations
of 1–4 and Prohance that maintain
≥90% cell viability. Concentration-dependent cell labeling
was determined by two approaches: normalizing contrast agent or Gd(III)
incubation concentrations. Data from studies where agent incubation
concentration was normalized show that multiplexed agents (1 and 2) have increased cell labeling compared to the
monomeric contrast agent (3) (Figure A).

Specifically, HeLa cells incubated with 1 and 2 exhibited a 1.5-fold and 2.7-fold increase in
cell labeling, respectively, compared to 3. The labeling
of lipophilic 1, 2, and 3 is
48-, 88-, and 32-fold higher, respectively, than nonlipophilic 4 and Prohance. Interestingly, data from studies where Gd(III)
incubation concentration is normalized (i.e., 3, 4, and Prohance are present at 3× the agent concentration
of 1 and 2) show that at high incubation
concentrations ([Gd(III)] &gt; 75 μM) complexes 2 and 3 label cells approximately 2-fold more effectively
than 1 (∼6 fmol Gd(III)/cell versus ∼3
fmol Gd(III)/cell,
Figure B). This is likely due to the two alkyl
chains present on 2 increasing cell membrane affinity
(compared to one alkyl chain for 1), whereas the increased
labeling of 3 is likely due to higher packing density
in the cell membrane since 3 has less steric bulk than
multimeric 1 and 2.

Concentration-dependent
cell labeling for 1–4 and Prohance.
HeLa cells incubated with normalized contrast
agent (A) or normalized Gd(III) concentrations (B) for 24 h. MDA-MB-231-mcherry
cells incubated with normalized contrast agent (C) or normalized Gd(III)
concentrations (D) for 24 h. Error bars represent ± standard
deviation of the mean of triplicate samples.

To ensure that cell labeling is independent of cell line
selection,
agent labeling was determined using MDA-MB-231-mcherry cells at both
normalized agent and Gd(III) incubation concentrations (Figure C and D). Multimeric 1 and 2 showed a 2.3- and 2.4-fold reduction in Gd(III) per cell, respectively,
compared to the values measured in HeLa cells. 3 showed
the same Gd(III) per cell in both cell lines suggesting it may be
a more universal cell labeling agent.

MR Imaging of Cells Labeled
with Lipophilic Contrast Agents
To evaluate contrast enhancement
of HeLa cells labeled with lipophilic
contrast agents 1–3, MR images of
cell pellets were acquired at 7 T. HeLa cells were incubated with
either 20 μM contrast agent (Figure A) or 90 μM normalized Gd(III) (Figure B). For both studies, lipophilic complexes 1–3 reduced the T1 relaxation time
(and thereby increased MR image contrast) compared to untreated cells
more effectively than 4 or Prohance.

Interestingly,
complex 3 produced the greatest reduction in T1 relaxation time and therefore the highest
image contrast for both studies (Figure , T2 data is in ). Since the Gd(III) concentration per cell is lower for 3 in both experiments, the enhanced image contrast observed is likely
due to increased relaxivity when embedded in the cell membrane or 1 and 2 being limited as T1 contrast agents by their higher r2/r1 ratios (approximately 2.8-fold higher
than 3 at 7 T, ).

T1-weighted cell pellet images of HeLa
cells incubated with 1–4 and Prohance
acquired at 7 T. A: Probe concentration was equalized at 20 μM.
B: Gd(III) concentration was equalized at 90 μM. For both images
TE = 11 ms, TR = 500 ms, MTX = 256 × 256, and slice thickness
is 1.0 mm. Scale bars represent 1 mm. Error represents ±1 standard
deviation of the mean of four 1-mm slices. These images show that 3 produces the most significant contrast enhancement compared
to untreated cells.

Lipophilic Contrast Agents
Localized in the Cell Membrane
To examine the cellular distribution
of lipophilic 1–3 and Prohance, HeLa
cells were incubated with
varying concentrations of each agent (concentrations were chosen to
normalize Gd(III) labeling) and were subjected to a cell fractionation
kit. The membrane and internalized (cytosol + endosomes) fractions
were collected and analyzed for Gd(III) content by ICP-MS. 2 (possessing two alkyl chains) displayed the highest membrane affinity
with 18-fold increased Gd(III) present in the membrane compared to
the internalized fraction (Figure ).

Localization
of contrast agents determined by cell fractionation.
The internalized (cytosol + endosomes) and membrane fraction were
analyzed by ICP-MS for Gd(III) content. All lipophilic complexes show
higher membrane accumulation than Prohance with 2 having
the greatest membrane localization. Error bars represent ± standard
deviation of the mean of triplicate samples.

1 and 3, with single alkyl chains,
contained
5.4- and 3.2-fold more Gd(III) in the membrane, respectively. The
only complex internalized into cells was Prohance. Since the lipophilic
complexes preferentially label cell membranes, we tested whether this
membrane anchoring translated to long-term Gd(III) retention compared
to internalized contrast agents.

Cellular Proliferation
and Retention of Lipophilic Agents
Cellular proliferation
and retention of the agents was investigated
by incubating HeLa, MDA, MB-213-mcherry, and NIH/3T3 cells with varying
concentrations of 1–3 and Prohance
(normalizing Gd(III) per cell). Following incubation, labeled cells
were replaced in contrast agent free media (time = 0) and allowed
to proliferate for 72 h (media was replaced every 24 h). Cell count
and Gd(III) content was determined at time = 0 and 72 h. Cells incubated
with the lipophilic contrast agents showed similar proliferative ability
compared to cells incubated with Prohance (Figure A).

Cellular retention of the contrast agents was determined
by calculating the fold change in cellular Gd(III) content between
time = 0 and 72 h. Complexes 1 and 2 showed
similar retention in all cell lines with 10–20-fold of the
label diluted after 72 h (Figure B). These
retention values represent a 10-, 6-, and 3.2-fold improvement over
the retention of Prohance in HeLa, MDA-MB-231-mcherry, and NIH/3T3
cells, respectively. The cellular retention of 3 was
highly cell line dependent with 36-fold of the label diluted in HeLa
cells, 105-fold in MDA-MB-231-mcherry cells, and 1000-fold in NIH/3T3
cells. In all cases, these values represent lower cellular retention
compared to multimeric 1 and 2 indicating
that the increased water solubility of 3 may reduce contrast
agent retention.

Surprisingly, the retention of 3 in MDA-MB-231-mcherry
and NIH/3T3 cells is lower than that of Prohance suggesting that 3 may not be ideal for long-term cell tracking studies. These
results demonstrate the cell line dependence of cellular retention
and show that this property must be measured in any new cell line
before long-term cell tracking experiments are performed.

Cellular proliferation
and retention of contrast agents 1–3 and Prohance after 72 h of leaching in HeLa,
MDA-MB-231-mcherry, and NIH/3T3 cell lines. A: Cellular proliferation
was determined by calculating the fold difference in cell count at t = 0 and 72 h. The data show that proliferation is not
affected by labeling with lipophilic contrast agents. B: Cellular
retention was determined by calculating the fold change in Gd(III)
per cell at t = 72 and 0 h. The data show that, while
retention is influenced by cell line selection, 1 and 2 have consistently enhanced retention compared to 3 and Prohance.

Conclusions
We
have developed a series of lipophilic MRI contrast agents that
efficiently label cell membranes in vitro. Two multimeric
agents were synthesized to increase Gd(III) payload per complex (1 and 2). These agents were found to be insoluble
in water, which necessitated the use of cholate (a detergent) for
solubilizaion to allow biological testing. In order to overcome solubility
constraints, a water-soluble lipophilic contrast agent was synthesized
using a single Gd(III) chelate (3).

All three lipophilic
contrast agents showed increased labeling
in HeLa and MDA-MB-231-mcherry cells compared to contrast agents that
are internalized by cells (4 and Prohance) without significantly
affecting cell viability or proliferation. In studies where contrast
agent incubation concentrations were normalized, 1 and 2 effectively delivered the most Gd(III) to cells; however,
in studies where Gd(III) incubation concentrations were normalized 2 and 3 were the most effective agents. Additionally,
at 7 T cells incubated with 3 show the greatest reduction
in T1 and therefore the most significant
contrast enhancement at both normalized contrast agent and Gd(III)
incubation concentrations. The surprising efficacy of 3 is attributed to higher packing in the cell membrane since it has
less steric bulk than 1 and 2. Multimeric 1 and 2 had significantly enhanced cellular retention
compared to Prohance in HeLa, MDA-MB-231-mcherry, and NIH/3T3 cells.
Complex 3 showed decreased cellular retention compared
to Prohance in MDA-MB-231 and NIH/3T3 cells, which will likely minimize
its utility as a long-term cell tracking agent. Future work on this
design will include modifying the aliphatic chain length and branching
to increase complex hydrophobicity which should translate to improved
cellular retention without sacrificing the significant contrast enhancement
produced at high field strengths.

The high cell labeling and
retention of complex 2 may
be well suited for in vivo applications such as fate
mapping and stem cell tracking that will require highly efficient
membrane-anchored contrast agents to combat the decrease in MR image
contrast that arises from agent efflux and endosomal entrapment of
intracellular contrast agents.

Relaxivity (r1)
Solutions
of 1 and 2 were prepared in 500 μL
of 4 mM cholate solution for T1 acquisition.
Solutions of 3 were prepared in both 4 mM cholate and
Millipore H2O. T1 (spin–lattice
relaxation time) was determined at 60 MHz (1.41 T) and 37 °C
using an inversion recovery pulse sequence on a Bruker mq60 minispec
NMR spectrometer with 4 averages, 15 s repetition time, and 10 data
points (Bruker Canada; Milton, Ontario, Canada). The Gd(III) concentration
of each solution was determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer (ICP-MS). The inverse of the longitudinal relaxation
time (1/T1, s–1) was
plotted against Gd(III) concentration (mM) and fitted to a straight
line with R2 &gt; 0.99. The slope of the
fitted line was recorded as the relaxivity, r1.

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
Samples
for DLS were
prepared at 1.2 mM Gd(III) concentration and filtered by 0.2 μm
filters. Data was acquired on a Malvern Instruments Zetasizer Nano
Series Nano-ZS equipped with Dispersion Technology Software v 5.03
(Worcestershire, United Kingdom). Measurements were performed in triplicate
at room temperature in SARSTEDT clear polystyrene 10 × 10 ×
45 mm3 cuvettes. Data analysis was performed on Zetasizer
Software v 7.02 (Worcestershire, United Kingdom).

General Cell
Culture Methods
Dulbecco’s modified
phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), media, and dissociation reagents
were purchased from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). CorningBrand
cell culture consumables (flasks, plates, etc.) and sera were purchased
from VWR Scientific (Radnor, PA). HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) and NIH/3T3
cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-231-mcherry cells were a gift of
Northwestern’s Developmental Therapeutics Core. Both HeLa and
MDA-MB-231-mcherry cells were cultured in phenol red free minimum
essential media (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
NIH/3T3 cells were cultured in Phenol Red free Dulbecco’s modified
eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum. Prior
to all experiments, cells were plated and allowed to incubate for
24 h before dosing. Cells were harvested with 0.25% TrypLE for 10
min at 37 °C in a 5.0% CO2 incubator. All doses were
filtered with 0.2 μm sterile filters prior to administration.
Cells were grown in a humidified incubator operating at 37 °C
and 5.0% CO2 unless otherwise specified.

Cell Counting
Cell counting was accomplished using
a Guava EasyCyte Mini Personal Cell Analyzer (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
MA). After cell harvesting, an aliquot (50 μL) of the cell suspensions
was mixed with Guava ViaCount reagent (150 μL) and allowed to
stain at room temperature for 5 min. Stained samples were vortexed
for 10 s and then cells were counted using a Guava EasyCyte Mini Personal
Cell Analyzer (PCA) using the ViaCount software module. For each sample,
1000 events were acquired with dilution factors that were determined
based upon optimum machine performance (∼20–70 cells/μL).
Instrument reproducibility was assessed daily using GuavaCheck Beads
and following the manufacturer’s suggested protocol using the
Daily Check software module.

Cellular Labeling Studies
Cell labeling studies were
performed with either HeLa or MDA-MB-231-mcherry cells. Specifically
20,000–25,000 cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate.
For concentration-dependent labeling studies, complexes 1–4 and Prohance were dissolved in 0.4 mM cholate
and media at concentrations of 120, 60, 30, and 15 μM of Gd(III)
and incubated with cells for 24 h (180 μL dose). For time-dependent
labeling studies, cells were incubated with 50 μM of Gd(III)
for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Cells were rinsed twice with 500 μL
0.4 mM cholate PBS and trypsinized following contrast agent incubation
and pelleted at 1000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
media was aspirated off and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200
μL of media. 50 μL of the cell suspension was used for
cell counting and 130 μL was used for Gd(III) content analysis
via ICP-MS.

Cell Leaching Studies
Leaching studies
were performed
with HeLa, MDA-MB-231-mcherry, and NIH/3T3 cells. Specifically, 50,000
cells were plated in each well of a 12-well plate and incubated for
24 h. Cells were incubated with complexes 1–3 and Prohance in 0.4 mM cholate in media (600 μL dose)
for 24 h at various concentrations to equalize cell labeling. Cells
were washed with 0.5 mL 0.4 mM cholate DPBS and trypsinized. The resulting
solution was centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min at 4
°C. The media was aspirated and cell pellets were suspended in
500 μL of media. A small aliquot (50 μL) was used for
cell counting and 100 μL was used for analysis by ICP-MS. The
remainder was replated in 6 well plates. Every 24 h, the media was
collected, centrifuged, and 250 μL was used for analysis by
ICP-MS. The cells were washed with 1 mL 0.4 mM cholate PBS and fresh
media was added to the cells. After the 72 h time point, cells were
trypsinized and centrifuged. The media was aspirated and the cell
pellet was resuspended in 200 μL media. A 20 μL aliquot
was used for cell counting and the remainder analyzed by ICP-MS.

Cell Fractionation
The BioVision FractionPREP Cell
Fractionation system (Milpitas, CA) was used to fractionate HeLa cells
labeled with complexes 1–3 and Prohance
(dissolved in 0.4 mM cholate in media) for 24 h at various incubation
concentrations chosen to equalize cell labeling. The manufacturer’s
protocol was followed to isolate cytosol and membrane fractions. Each
fraction was analyzed by ICP-MS and the ratio between the two was
used to determine localization.

Cytotoxicity
The
CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive
Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to measure
cell viability. HeLa cells were plated in 96-well plates (5000 cells
per well for 24 h incubations and 1000 cells per well for 72 h incubations).
Complexes 1–4 and Prohance were dissolved
in 0.4 mM cholate and media at various concentrations and incubated
with cells (50 μL doses) for 24 or 72 h. After incubation, the
assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s suggested
protocol. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a Biotek Synergy4
microplate reader (Winooski, VT).

ICP-MS Sample Preparation
and Instrument Parameters
For relaxivity and cell studies
Gd(III) content was measured via
ICP-MS. Specifically, samples were prepared by adding ACS reagent
grade nitric acid (70%) to solutions of contrast agent or cell suspensions
(1:1 v/v sample:nitric acid) in 15 mL conical tubes. Samples were
incubated at 70 °C for at least 4.0 h to allow for complete sample
digestion. Following sample digestion, multi-element internal standard
(containing Bi, Ho, In, Li, Sc, Tb, and Y, Inorganic Ventures, Christiansburg,
VA) and filtered deionized H2O (18.2 MΩ·cm)
were added, producing a final ICP-MS sample of 3% (v/v) nitric acid
and 5 ng/mL internal standard.

ICP-MS was performed on a computer-controlled
(Plasmalab software) Thermo X series II ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) operating in standard mode equipped with an ESI
SC-2 autosampler (Omaha, NE, USA). Each sample was acquired using
1 survey run (10 sweeps) and 3 main (peak jumping) runs (100 sweeps).
The isotopes selected for analysis were 154,157,158Gd with 115In and 165Ho isotopes selected as internal standards
for data interpolation. Instrument performance is optimized daily
through an autotune followed by verification via a performance report
(passing manufacturer specifications). Instrument calibration was
accomplished by preparing individual-element Gd(III) standards (Inorganic
Ventures, Christiansburg, VA, USA) using concentrations of 0.78125,
1.5625, 3.125, 6.25, 12.50, 25.00, 50.00, 100.0, and 200.0 ng/mL containing
3.0% nitric acid (v/v) and 5.0 ng/mL of multi-element internal standard.

Cell Pellet MR Imaging
MR imaging and T1/T2 measurements were performed
on a Bruker Pharmscan 7 T imaging spectrometer fitted with shielded
gradient coils at 25 °C. For cell pellet images, ∼5 ×
105 HeLa cells were incubated in 25 cm2 T-flasks
with complexes 1–4 and Prohance for
24 h, rinsed with DPBS (2 × 1 mL/flask), and harvested with 500
μL of trypsin. After addition of 500 μL of fresh complete
media, cells were transferred to 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and
centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4.0 °C for 5
min. The supernatant was removed; the cell pellets were resuspended
in 1 mL of complete media, added to 53/4″ flame-sealed Pasteur
pipets, and centrifuged at 100 × g at 4.0 °C
for 5 min. The bottom sections of the flame-sealed pipets were then
scored with a glass scribe, broken into small capillaries, and imaged
using a RF RES 300 1H 089/023 quadrature transmit receive 23 mm volume
coil (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA, USA). Solution phantoms were
prepared, imaged, and analyzed as previously described using serially
diluted solutions.

Spin–lattice relaxation times (T1) were measured using a rapid-acquisition rapid-echo
(RARE-VTR) T1-map pulse sequence, with
static TE (11 ms) and variable TR (150, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000,
4000, 6000, 8000, and 10000 ms) values. Imaging parameters were as
follows: field of view (FOV) = 25 × 25 mm2, matrix
size (MTX) = 256 × 256, number of axial slices = 4, slice thickness
(SI) = 1.0 mm, and averages (NEX) = 3 (total scan time = 2 h 36 min). T1 analysis was carried out using the image sequence
analysis tool in Paravision 5.0 pl3 software (Bruker, Billerica, MA,
USA) with monoexponential curve-fitting of image intensities of selected
regions of interest (ROIs) for each axial slice.

Spin–spin
relaxation times (T2) were measured using
a multislice multiecho (MSME) T2-map pulse
sequence, with static TR (5000 ms) and 32
fitted echoes in 11 ms intervals (11, 22, ···, 352
ms). Imaging parameters were as follows: field of view (FOV) = 25
× 25 mm2, matrix size (MTX) = 256 × 256, number
of axial slices = 4, slice thickness (SI) = 1.0 mm, and averages (NEX)
= 3 (total scan time = 48 min). T2 analysis
was carried out using the image sequence analysis tool in Paravision
5.0 pl3 software (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) with monoexponential
curve-fitting of image intensities of selected regions of interest
(ROIs) for each axial slice.
