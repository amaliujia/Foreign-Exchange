Scandium-44
(t1/2 = 3.9 h) is a relatively
new radioisotope of potential interest for use in clinical positron
emission tomography (PET). Herein, we report, for the first time,
the room-temperature radiolabeling of proteins with 44Sc
for in vivo PET imaging. For this purpose, the Fab
fragment of Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds with high
affinity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), was generated
and conjugated with N-[(R)-2-amino-3-(para-isothiocyanato-phenyl)propyl]-trans-(S,S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentaacetic acid (CHX-A″-DTPA).
The high purity of Cetuximab-Fab was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass
spectrometry. The potential of the bioconjugate for PET imaging of
EGFR expression in human glioblastoma (U87MG) tumor-bearing mice was
investigated after 44Sc labeling. PET imaging revealed
rapid tumor uptake (maximum uptake of ∼12% ID/g at 4 h postinjection)
of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
with excellent tumor-to-background ratio, which might allow for same
day PET imaging in future clinical studies. Immunofluorescence staining
was conducted to correlate tracer uptake in the tumor and normal tissues
with EGFR expression. This successful strategy for immunoPET imaging
of EGFR expression using 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
can make clinically translatable advances to select the right population
of patients for EGFR-targeted therapy and also to monitor the therapeutic
efficacy of anti-EGFR treatments.

Introduction
Scandium-44 is a relatively
new radioisotope with excellent nuclear
decay characteristics [t1/2 = 3.9 h, Eβ+ (max) = 1.47 MeV, β+ branching ratio = 94.3%] for PET imaging.1 The radioisotope can be conveniently produced in a cyclotron by
irradiation of Ca targets with protons by the nuclear reaction 44Ca(p,n)44Sc.2,3 The longer half-life
of 44Sc compared to that of other more commonly used PET
radioisotopes such as 18F (t1/2 = 109 min) or 68Ga (t1/2 =
68 min) potentially allows for the centralized production and cost-efficient
distribution of 44Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals regionally.
Another advantage lies in the availability of 47Sc (t1/2 = 3.35 days), which is a moderate energy
(0.6 MeV, 100%) β– emitter suitable for targeted
therapy.3 By coupling to the same biological
vector, 44Sc can be used as an imaging surrogate for 47Sc and might also aid in estimating dosimetry for therapy
with 47Sc, thereby representing an ideal theranostic pair.

Despite these excellent attributes, only limited number of 44Sc radiopharmaceuticals based on peptides and other small
biomolecules has been reported to date.4−7 In all of these studies, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid (DOTA) was used as the bifunctional chelator (BFC), and radiolabeling
was carried out at ∼95 °C. Although 44Sc–DOTA
complexes are formed with high in vivo stability,1,8 the relatively slow complexation kinetics and requirement of elevated
temperature for complex formation impede the preparation of radiotracers
comprising temperature-sensitive and fragile macromolecules such as
proteins. In view of this, it is essential to identify a suitable
BFC that can be radiolabeled with 44Sc at room temperature
within a reasonable period of time and that also demonstrates high in vitro and in vivo stability. The feasibility
to radiolabel 44Sc with proteins such as antibody fragments
would enhance the scope of 44Sc-radiopharmacy and facilitate
utilization of this radioisotope for immunoPET imaging.

Over
the last few decades, EGFR has been investigated as a major
target for uncontrolled tumor growth in various types of cancers.9 Cetuximab is a chimeric human–murine IgG1
monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to EGFR with high affinity.10,11 Delayed tumor uptake and prolonged circulation half-life are the
major limitations toward the use of intact antibodies as molecular
imaging probes.12−14 In order to accelerate targeting of EGFR, Cetuximab-F(ab′)2 fragments were earlier generated and radiolabeled with 111In.15,16 However, it took several hours
to obtain satisfactory contrast between the tumor and normal tissues
after administration of the radiolabeled agent.16 This is especially disadvantageous when repeated imaging
is required within short time intervals, for example, when studying
the dynamics of EGFR expression during treatment. Therefore, we aimed
to further improve EGFR targeting kinetics by using monovalent (Fab)
fragments of Cetuximab for PET imaging. Cetuximab-Fab fragments, comprising
both VH and VL domains, are expected to retain
the specificity and antigen-binding affinity of the parent antibody
while demonstrating improved pharmacokinetics for tissue penetration.12 The decay half-life of 44Sc matches
the biological half-life of Fab fragments, which is another desirable
feature for successful immunoPET imaging.12

Herein, we report the generation of a Cetuximab-Fab fragment
and
its radiolabeling with 44Sc at room temperature using CHX-A″-DTPA
(N-[(R)-2-amino-3-(para-isothiocyanato-phenyl) propyl]-trans-(S,S)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentaacetic acid) as the BFC. The in vitro and in vivo characteristics of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
were investigated for PET imaging of EGFR expression in a human glioblastoma
(U87MG) tumor model. The present study is the first report, to the
best of our knowledge, of the radiolabeling and preclinical evaluation
of 44Sc-labeled protein molecules. This strategy can be
extended for radiolabeling other temperature-sensitive biomolecules
with 44Sc for PET imaging.

Results
Generation
of Cetuximab-Fab and Its Characterization
Cetuximab-Fab was
generated from the intact antibody upon papain
digestion for 4 h (Figure 1A). Protein A columns
were used for separation of Cetuximab-Fab from the intact antibody
and Fc fragments. The Protein A resin binds specifically to the Fc
region of immunoglobulin molecules, especially IgGs,17−19 allowing intact antibody and the Fc fragments generated during papain
digestion to be trapped in the column and purified Cetuximab-Fab to
pass through. Purified Cetuximab-Fab solution was further concentrated
and buffer exchanged into PBS by ultrafiltration. SDS-PAGE showed
the disappearance of the intact Cetuximab band (∼150 kDa) and
the appearance of a band corresponding to Cetuximab-Fab (∼50
kDa), indicating complete digestion of Cetuximab by papain to yield
a high-quality Fab fragment (Figure 1B). The
molecular weight of Cetuximab-Fab, as determined by mass spectrometry,
was ∼49.9 kDa (Figure 1C). The purified
Cetuximab-Fab was further used for bioconjugation and preclinical
investigation in targeted, blocking, and negative control groups.
For non-targeted groups, the purified Fab fragments were denatured
by high-energy ultrasonication for over 1 h

column). (C) Mass spectrometry of Cetuximab-Fab (∼49.9 kDa).

Flow Cytometry
To confirm that the generated Cetuximab-Fab
retained the EGFR-binding characteristics of the intact antibody, in vitro targeting experiments were carried out using U87MG
(high EGFR expression) and Caco-2 (low EGFR expression) cells for
flow cytometry. Fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC; excitation = 494
nm/emission = 521 nm) conjugated Cetuximab-Fab (50 nM) significantly
enhanced the mean fluorescence intensity of U87MG cells (∼20-fold
higher than that of unstained cells), whereas treatment with a blocking
dose of Cetuximab (1 μM) reduced the cell fluorescence by about
10-fold (Figure 2A). These results demonstrate
that FITC–Cetuximab-Fab specifically binds to EGFR on the U87MG
cells. Meanwhile, the fluorescence signal from Caco-2 cells was minimal,
indicating low nonspecific binding of FITC–Cetuximab-Fab (Figure 2B). The differences in the mean fluorescence intensities
of U87MG and Caco-2 cells for targeted and blocking groups are shown
in Figure S1. The control groups for both
cell types show similar fluorescence background, which confirms that
FITC–Cetuximab-Fab exhibits strong and specific binding to
EGFR with negligible nonspecific binding in vitro. Papain digestion, therefore, does not compromise the EGFR-binding
specificity of Cetuximab-Fab, thereby encouraging further in vivo studies.

and Caco-2 (low
EGFR expression) cells confirms the EGFR specificity and affinity
of Cetuximab-Fab.

44Sc Labeling
of Cetuximab-Fab and Serum Stability
Evaluation
Both intact and denatured Cetuximab-Fab fragments
were labeled with 44Sc for in vivo studies
(see Experimental Section). The labeling conditions
were carefully optimized to give the highest radiolabeling yields
(see Supporting Information, experimental
section and Figure S2). The radiolabeled
bioconjugates were purified using PD-10 columns with PBS as the mobile
phase. The radioactive fractions, which typically elute between 3
and 4 mL, were collected for further experiments, and a typical size-exclusion
column chromatography profile can be seen in Figure
S3A. The unreacted 44Sc starts eluting from the
column after 6.0 mL. The decay-corrected radiochemical yields of Cetuximab-Fab
conjugated with different BFCs are summarized in Table S1. Only DTPA analogues were found to be suitable for
complexation with 44Sc at room temperature with appreciable
yields for in vivo studies. Since the in
vivo stability of CHX-A″-DTPA complexes is expected
to be better than that of conventional DTPA analogues,20,2144Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab was
used in all further studies. The specific activity of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab was ∼63
GBq/μmol, assuming complete recovery of the radiolabeled agent
after size-exclusion chromatography. The whole procedure of 44Sc labeling and purification of the radiolabeled Fab fragment could
be completed within 45 min.

Before in vivo investigation
in mice, serum stability studies were carried out to assess the stability
of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab.
High serum stability is a prerequisite for in vivo applications of a radiolabeled agent. If the radiolabeled complexes
are not stable in serum, then 44Sc may be transchelated
by serum proteins, resulting in accumulation of the radioactivity
in non-target organs and faulty interpretation of the imaging data
obtained. It was found that &gt;92% of 44Sc remained within
the CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab conjugates over a 6 h
incubation period (Figure S3B), indicating
high stability of the 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA complex.

In Vivo PET Imaging and Biodistribution Studies
The time points of 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h postinjection (p.i.) were
chosen for serial PET scans. The coronal slices that contain the U87MG
(high EGFR expression) or Caco-2 (low EGFR expression) tumors are
shown in Figure 3A. In addition, representative
microPET, microCT, and fused images of a mouse at 4 h p.i. of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab are shown
in Figure 3B for direct visual comparison.
Quantitative data obtained from ROI analysis of the PET images are
shown in Figure 4A–D. 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
accumulated rapidly in the tumor and was clearly visible as early
as 0.5 h p.i., peaked at 4 h p.i., and remained prominent over time
(7.1 ± 0.6, 11.2 ± 1.5, 12.7 ± 0.7, and 12.0 ±
0.3% ID/g at 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., respectively; n = 3; Figures 3A(I) and 4A). The uptake of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
in liver was found to be 15.9 ± 1.4, 14.6 ± 1.8, 13.8 ±
1.6, and 13.5 ± 1.9% ID/g at 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., respectively.
Moreover, considerable uptake was observed in the kidneys, 21.1 ±
1.7, 32.7 ± 2.8, 31.3 ± 1.5, and 28.1 ± 2.4% ID/g at
0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., respectively (n = 3; Figure 4A). This indicates successful clearance of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab fragment
through both hepatobiliary and renal pathways, which can be attributed
to the much smaller size of the Fab fragment compared to that of the
intact Cetuximab antibody (49.9 vs 150 kDa). Radioactivity levels
in the blood were found to be 7.6 ± 1.1, 2.7 ± 0.5, 1.7
± 0.3, and 1.4 ± 0.2% ID/g at 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., respectively
(n = 3; Figure 4A), indicating
significantly faster clearance from the blood than that of radiolabeled
intact Cetuximab, which had high (∼10% ID/g) blood radioactivity
levels even at 48 h p.i.16,22 Furthermore, to confirm
that the uptake of the radiolabeled probes was specifically due to
EGFR targeting and not a result of the enhanced permeability and retention
(EPR) effect in U87MG tumors, serial PET scans with intravenous injections
of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA-denatured-Cetuximab-Fab
were also carried out in U87MG tumor-bearing mice (n = 3) as a non-targeted control (Figures 3A(II) and 4B).

Administering a blocking dose of Cetuximab significantly
reduced
the tumor uptake of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
to 1.1 ± 0.2, 0.98 ± 0.21, 1.0 ± 0.1, and 0.71 ±
0.23% ID/g at 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., respectively (n = 3; Figures 3A(III) and 4C), further demonstrating the specificity of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab toward EGFR in vivo. The specificity of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
was further validated by in vivo studies in mice
bearing Caco-2 (EGFR negative) tumors, where the tumor uptake was
minimal (0.86 ± 0.07, 1.6 ± 0.2, 2.4 ± 0.3, and 2.0
± 0.4% ID/g at 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 h p.i., respectively; n = 3), as shown in Figures 3A(IV)
and 4D. The radioactivity uptake in all other
organs was similar to that of U87MG tumor-bearing mice. Figure 4D summarizes and compares the tumor uptake of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab in all
four groups. The differences in tumor % ID/g values were statistically
significant (P &lt; 0.05; n = 3)
at all time points examined. After the last PET scans at 6 h p.i.,
mice were sacrificed, and ex vivo biodistribution
studies were performed. Good agreement was observed between the biodistribution
data and that obtained from ROI quantification of tracer uptake based
on PET images at the last time point (Figure 5). The results were further validated by ex vivo histological examination (see Supporting Information, Figure S4)

Discussion
EGFR
is a glycosylated transmembrane protein that contributes in
several tumorigenic mechanisms including tumor survival, invasion,
angiogenesis, and metastatic spread.11,23 It is also
involved in the pathogenesis of many tumors. In many cases, EGFR expression
may act as a prognostic indicator, predicting poor survival and/or
more advanced disease stages.9,23 Overexpression of EGFR
has been found in several human malignancies such as cancers of the
head and neck, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, ovary, cervix, breast,
lung, kidney, and bladder.11 To target
EGFR-mediated tumor cell proliferation or growth, a chimeric human–murine
IgG1 monoclonal antibody, Cetuximab, has been developed that specifically
binds to the EGFR with high affinity.11 The United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has approved
this antibody for treatment of patients with EGFR-expressing metastatic
colorectal carcinomas.11 However, not much
is known about patient-specific tumor uptake and the relationship
between dosage and efficacy of Cetuximab therapy.22 Moreover, delayed uptake in tumor and extended circulation
times are some major disadvantages associated with the use of intact
antibodies for immunoPET studies.12,14

Antibody
Fab fragments with lower molecular weight compared to
that of intact antibodies are expected to display faster blood-/tissue-clearance
kinetics, thereby exhibiting a high tumor contrast within 2–3
h after intravenous injection.12 Moreover,
engineered antibody fragments like Fab have been shown to be much
less immunogenic than that of intact antibodies, which is further
advantageous for molecular imaging.14 Despite
the well-documented use of Cetuximab in molecular imaging and therapy,10,22,24 there are surprisingly no reports
on use of its Fab fragment. The present study showed that 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab can be an effective
tracer for early noninvasive imaging of EGFR expression in a human
glioblastoma (U87MG) tumor model, reported to demonstrate high EGFR
expression.2244Sc was chosen
due to its favorable nuclear decay characteristics [Eβ+ (max) = 1.47 MeV, β+ branching
ratio = 94.3%] and its short half-life (∼3.9 h), which is very
well-suited for imaging applications with antibody fragments with
comparable biological half-lives. The high branching ratio of 44Sc allows a lower amount of activity to be administered for
PET imaging, resulting in a lower radiation dose to normal tissues.

There are two main routes for production of 44Sc. In
the first method, 44Sc can be obtained as a daughter product
of 44Ti via 44Ti/44Sc generator.1 The cyclotron-independent availability of 44Sc from 44Ti/44Sc generator provides
the obvious logistic advantages for usage of this excellent radioisotope
at remote PET facilities. Owing to the long half-life of 44Ti (t1/2 = 59.3 y), ideally this generator
should be able to provide 44Sc for several decades.1 However, 44Ti is produced through
the nuclear reaction 45Sc(p,2n)44Ti, which requires
long-term irradiation of Sc targets at a high proton flux (25 MeV
proton, 200 μA) for production of sufficient quantities of 44Ti.3 Presently, 44Ti
can be produced only at a few facilities in the world, with limited
yields and at high costs.1,6 Also, 44Sc
availed from this generator is not directly amenable for radiopharmaceutical
preparation and requires postelution concentration and purification
procedures that make the process cumbersome.25 These undesirable features make the 44Ti/44Sc generator impractical for use in clinical context. A more prudent
approach is the direct cyclotron production of 44Sc by
proton irradiation of natural calcium targets.2,6,26,31 There are
numerous cyclotron facilities all over the world that can be utilized
for cost-effective production of 44Sc with adequate yields
and radionuclidic purity suitable for clinical studies.

A critical
component of a 44Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals
is the BFC that binds the radiometal ion in a stable coordination
complex and also conjugates with a suitable biomolecule for in vivo tumor-targeted imaging.8,21,27 In order to use 44Sc for labeling
Cetuximab-Fab, it is essential to ensure that the radiolabeling is
carried out within a reasonable period of time at room temperature
to prevent denaturation of the antibody. Although the thermodynamic
stability constant of Sc3+ complexed with DOTA is much
higher than that with other polyaminopolyacetate ligands (Table S1),27 an adequate
radiolabeling yield could not be achieved at room temperature using
this BFC. In view of this, use of acyclic DTPA analogues for radiolabeling
Cetuximab-Fab appears to be an ideal choice, as they demonstrate rapid
complexation kinetics with 44Sc3+ at room temperature.
However, DTPA complexes with 90Y3+ (which has
similar chemical properties as those of 44Sc3+, belonging to the same group in the periodic table) have been reported
to be kinetically labile when administered in vivo.20,21 The structurally reinforced CHX-A″-DTPA
is a significant improvement over the traditional DTPA chelators in
terms of increased in vivo stability without sacrificing
the rapid complexation kinetics.20,21 This is probably
due to the presence of the cyclohexyl group, which increases the rigidity
of the structure of the complex, thereby reducing the rate of dissociation.20 CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab could
be radiolabeled with 44Sc at room temperature with &gt;60%
yield and appreciable specific activity (∼63 GBq/μmol). 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab could retain
its integrity even when incubated in an excess volume of mouse serum
at 37 °C for 6 h, demonstrating its suitability for in
vivo PET imaging.

In vivo PET imaging
of EGFR expression in U87MG
tumor-bearing mice showed a good uptake of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
as early as 0.5 h after injection of the tracer, with excellent imaging
contrast within 2 h. The maximum tumor uptake (∼12% ID/g) of
the radiolabeled Cetuximab-Fab was slightly lower than the maximum
tumor uptake (∼13% ID/g) reported for the intact antibody.22 This is expected since the Fab fragment lacks
the Fc region that has been shown to play an important role in internalization
of the antibody.12,14 However, the lack of Fc reduces
nonspecific binding between Fc and its receptors on various types
of cells (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, natural
killer cells, B cells, etc.) and thus improves the tumor-to-normal
tissue ratio.12

Rapid clearance of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
by renal and hepatobiliary routes enables fast and repeated imaging,
which might be helpful in monitoring tumor dynamics. Also, the high
tumor-to-blood ratio of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
at early time points would allow same-day PET imaging following radiotracer
injection. Thus, 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
could overcome the inherent shortcomings of Cetuximab-based immunoPET
imaging because of its rapid tumor accumulation and fast background
clearance, without significantly compromising tumor uptake. This strategy
can be a valuable asset in selecting patients for anti-EGFR therapy
and also for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of the process.

Conclusions
In the present study, we report the successful production and characterization
of Cetuximab-Fab. We further demonstrated the feasibility of using
cyclotron-produced 44Sc for radiolabeling the Fab fragments
at room temperature in order to image EGFR expression in glioblastoma
xenografts in mice. Among the various BFCs studied, CHX-A″-DTPA
was identified as the most promising choice as it permits 44Sc labeling at room temperature within a reasonable period of time. 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab could be
prepared with high radiolabeling yield and appreciable specific activity
suitable for in vivo studies. Serum stability studies
revealed that the radiolabeled bioconjugate was remarkably stable
in mouse serum maintained at 37 °C. Rapid, prominent, and target-specific
uptake in U87MG tumors was observed for 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab.
The radiolabeled agent was rapidly cleared from the biological system
by both hepatobiliary and renal routes. This study may further inspire
development of new 44Sc/47Sc-based radiopharmaceuticals
for immunoPET imaging and personalized cancer management.

USA). The purity of Cetuximab-Fab was evaluated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 5% stacking
gel and 8% resolving gel; nonreducing conditions) using Coomassie
brilliant blue R-250 staining. The molecular weight of Cetuximab-Fab
was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)
mass spectrometry, which served as a reference for the Cetuximab-Fab
band in SDS-PAGE.

BFC/FITC/AlexaFluor350 Conjugation of Cetuximab-Fab
CHX-A″-DTPA conjugation with denatured and intact Cetuximab-Fab
was carried out at pH 9.0, maintaining the reaction ratio of CHX-A″-DTPA
to Cetuximab-Fab at 10:1. CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
was purified using PD-10 columns, with PBS as the mobile phase. CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
eluted between 3.0 and 4.0 mL. The same procedure was adopted for
conjugation of other BFCs (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA, p-SCN-Bn-DOTA, and p-SCN-Bn-NOTA). FITC
(for flow cytometry analysis) or AlexaFluor350-NHS ester (for histology
applications) was also conjugated to Cetuximab-Fab using similar reaction
and purification procedures. However, the reaction ratio of FITC or
AlexaFluor350-NHS ester to Cetuximab-Fab was 3:1 to limit the number
of dyes per Cetuximab-Fab and to avoid self-quenching of the fluorescence
signal.

Flow Cytometry
The EGFR specificity of Cetuximab-Fab
was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
using two cell lines: human glioblastoma cells (U87MG; high EGFR expression22) and human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma
cells (Caco-2; low EGFR expression29).
Cells were harvested and suspended in cold PBS (pH 7.4) with 2% bovine
serum albumin at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL
and were incubated with FITC–Cetuximab-Fab at 50 nM concentration
for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 5 min. Afterward, the cells were analyzed by FACS using a BD FACSCalibur
four-color analysis cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and
FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).

Radiolabeling
of Cetuximab-Fab
Cyclotron-produced 44Sc (74 MBq)31 was diluted in 500
μL of 0.5 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and added to 40 μg
of BFC-conjugated Cetuximab-Fab. The pH of the reaction mixture was
carefully adjusted to ∼4.5, and the reaction was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature (25 °C) with constant shaking.
The radiolabeled agent was purified using PD-10 columns, with PBS
as the mobile phase. The radioactive fractions containing 44Sc-labeled-Cetuximab-Fab (which typically elute between 3 and 4 mL)
were collected and used for further in vivo PET imaging
studies. To determine the radiolabeling yield, the fractions containing
Cetuximab-Fab were pooled together, and combined activity was measured
and compared with the total activity passed through the column. The
radiolabeled agent was passed through a 0.2 μm syringe filter
before in vivo studies.

Serum Stability of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
In order to determine the in vitro stability of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab in mouse
serum, 200 μL of the reaction mixture was added to 1.8 mL of
mouse serum prewarmed at 37 °C and incubated at the same temperature
for different time intervals. As a control, equivalent activity of
free 44ScCl3 (maintained at pH 4.5 in acetate
buffer) was incubated with mouse serum under the same conditions.
Aliquots were withdrawn at intervals of 15 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4,
and 6 h, and their activities were measured. The aliquot at each time
point was taken in a 30 kDa centrifugal filter tube and centrifuged
at 5000 rcf for 15 min. The activity of the filtrate was measured,
corrected for decay, and compared with the activity of the serum solution
(before ultrafiltration) to determine the percentage of free 44Sc (that detaches from 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab)
at each time point.

Animal Models
All animal studies
were conducted under
a protocol approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. U87MG cells and Caco-2 cells were used for
tumor inoculation when they reached ∼80% confluence. Four-
to five-week-old female athymic nude mice were purchased from Harlan
(Indianapolis, IN), and tumors were established by subcutaneously
injecting 5 × 106 cells, suspended in 100 μL
of 1:1 mixture of DMEM medium and matrigel, into the front flank of
the mice.22 The tumor sizes were monitored
every alternate day, and in vivo experiments were
carried out when the diameter of the tumors reached 6–8 mm
(typically, 3 weeks after inoculation).

PET Imaging and Biodistribution
Studies
PET and PET/CT
scans at various time points p.i., image reconstruction, and region-of-interest
(ROI) analyses were performed using a microPET/microCT Inveon rodent
model scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc.) and Inveon Research
Workplace [IRW] vendor software, respectively, as described previously.30 Each tumor-bearing mouse was injected with 1.85–3.7
MBq of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
via the tail vein, and static PET scans were performed. In order to
improve the detection statistics and minimize interscan variability
due to radioactive decay, 20 × 106 coincidence events
per mouse were acquired for every static PET emission scan (energy
window, 350–650 keV; time window, 3.432 ns; resolution, 1.5
mm). Quantitative data is presented as percentage injected dose per
gram (% ID/g) of tissue. Blocking studies were carried out to evaluate
EGFR specificity of 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab in vivo, in which a group of three mice bearing U87MG tumors
was injected with 2 mg of Cetuximab 24 h before 44Sc–CHX-A″-DTPA–Cetuximab-Fab
administration. Biodistribution studies were carried out after the
last PET scans to validate the PET results. The radioactivity in the
tissue was measured using a gamma-counter (PerkinElmer) and presented
as percent (%) ID/g.
