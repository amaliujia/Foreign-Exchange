Introduction
The retina is supplied
with oxygen by two separate vascular systems,
the choroidal or outer retinal circulation, and the inner retinal
circulation. Adequate oxygen supply is
critical for normal functioning of the retina. The high oxygen requirements
of the retina for proper function and the unique structure required
for light to reach the photoreceptors make it vulnerable to vascular
diseases. Hypoxia plays a role in the
onset and progression of various retinal vascular diseases including
diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, both leading
causes of irreversible blindness.− Therefore, strategies
to monitor hypoxia in cell culture and animal models of these diseases
and patients are warranted.

Advancements in technologies including
retinal oximetry, phosphorescence
lifetime imaging, and Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT) have
provided a greater understanding of vascular oxygen supply and metabolism
in the retina. Retinal oximetry measures vascular oxygen tension in
inner retinal− and choroidal vasculature based on
hemoglobin oxygen saturation. Phosphorescence lifetime imaging measures
oxygen levels using an oxygen sensitive agent that is quenched by
oxygen allowing for vascular pO2 levels to be quantified. Doppler OCT measures retinal blood flow, which
can be used to derive retinal oxygen metabolic measurements. We seek to complement these approaches by developing
hypoxia-sensitive contrast agents which enable visualization of hypoxic
tissue in the retina and other tissues.

Our approach is based
on the conjugation of fluorescing dyes to
hypoxia-sensitive nitroimidazole moieties such as 2-nitroimidazole
and Pimonidazole, which are known to accumulate within hypoxic cells.− When injected in vivo, the nitro groups of these compounds are bioreduced
by nitroreductases in hypoxic tissues (pO2 &lt; 10 mmHg),
triggering formation of intracellular protein adducts. In traditional applications, detection of hypoxic
tissue is carried out via antibody based immunohistochemical staining
on excised tissues. We sought to develop a new synthetic route to
conjugate fluorescent dyes to nitroimidazoles toward enabling longitudinal
in vivo imaging applications which facilitate imaging of hypoxic tissue
while obviating the tissue dissection and processing steps. We focused
on development of clinically translatable imaging agents featuring
FDA-approved fluorescein dyes, which are routinely used in ophthalmic
examinations.

The goal of this work was to develop a hypoxia-sensitive
imaging
agent that would identify hypoxic cells in living tissue. To accomplish
this, nitroimidazole derivatives were conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) to create the imaging agents HYPOX-1, a 2-nitroimidazole containing
reagent, and HYPOX-2, a Pimonidazole containing reagent. Established
cell culture and mouse models of hypoxia-associated retinal disease
were used to test the specificity of both imaging agents for hypoxic
cells.

Results and Discussion
HYPOX-1 features a 2-nitroimidazole
group coupled to FITC via a
6 carbon linkage (Scheme ). Similarly, synthesis
of HYPOX-2 was carried out to yield a FITC dye attached directly to
amine-activated Pimonidazole (Scheme ). Yields
were 64% (HYPOX-1) and 76% (HYPOX-2), and compounds were characterized
using LC/MS and NMR analysis ( Figures 1–4).

Synthesis of HYPOX-1
Synthesis of HYPOX-2
In order to measure the specificity of HYPOX-1 and HYPOX-2
for
hypoxic retinal tissues in vitro, R28 rat retinal neuronal cells, or primary human Müller cells were conditioned in a hypoxic chamber purged with a mixture of nitrogen/carbon
dioxide up to 12 h. These two cell lines model predominantly oxygen-sensitive
cell types in retinal diseases with a hypoxia-ischemia component. We confirmed that hypoxia was achieved in retinal
cell lines using Pimonidazole adduct immunostaining ( Figure 5) and qRT-PCR analysis of the
hypoxia-specific biomarker carbonic anhydrase II ( Figure 6). In a microplate fluorescence spectrophotometric assay (Figure A–D), hypoxia-conditioned R28 cells and human
Müller cells exhibited significantly higher fluorescence intensity
than normoxia-conditioned R28 cells and human Müller cells
when treated with HYPOX-1 and HYPOX-2. The micromolar doses of HYPOX-1
and HYPOX-2 used in these experiments are modeled on doses used to
achieve optimal signal to background ratios using Pimonidazole immunohistochemistry. At the concentration of Pimonidazole typically
used for immunohistochemical assays (100 μM), HYPOX-1 and -2
fluorescence emission was 2.7- and 4.4-fold higher in hypoxic R28
cells vs normoxic R28 cells, with enhanced signal-to-noise ratios
observed for the 50 μM dose (Figure A,B). HYPOX-1 and HYPOX-2 showed 5-fold and 11-fold increases in
hypoxic/normoxic fluorescence intensity ratios, respectively, in human
Müller cells (Figure C,D). At concentrations
lower than 50 μM, HYPOX-1 was not detectable. However, HYPOX-2
was effective at 10 μM in human Müller cells showing
a 32-fold greater fluorescence intensity in hypoxia-conditioned cells
(Figure D). These data demonstrate that HYPOX-1
and -2 are selectively retained in hypoxic retinal cells irrespective
of cell type and species origin.

Hypoxic R28 and Müller cells treated
with HYPOX imaging
agents exhibit dose-dependent fluorescence enhancement in a microplate
fluorescence spectrophotometric assay. Cells were conditioned under
normoxic conditions or 12 h of hypoxia. (A-B) HYPOX-1 and HYPOX-2

cell assay. (n = 8) * p &lt; 0.01.
R28 cells were treated with 100 μM HYPOX-1 (green) and (E-F)
normoxia or (G-H) hypoxia-conditioned for 4 h and stained with DAPI
(blue).

Fluorescence microscopy of R28
cells treated with HYPOX-1 and -2
confirmed observations in microplate spectrophotometry assays (Figures E–H and ). Furthermore,
hypoxic cells incubated with HYPOX-1 and -2, but not normoxic cells,
were positive for Pimonidazole adducts as detectable by an adduct-specific
antibody (Hypoxyprobe) which does not bind to Pimonidazole moieties
alone (Figure F). These results were further
confirmed by Western Blot analysis, in which hypoxic and normoxic
cell lysates were probed with a Hypoxyprobe antibody ( Figure 7). These data
suggest that HYPOX-1 and -2 accumulate in hypoxic cells by the same
bioreduction/adduct formation mechanism observed for nitroimidazole
compounds.

R28 retinal neuronal
cell lines conditioned under (A–C)
normoxic or (D–F) hypoxic (4 h) conditions were incubated with
100 μM HYPOX-2 (green) followed by fixation and immunostaining
with an antibody specific for Pimonidazole adducts, Hypoxyprobe, (red)
in hypoxic cells.

Both imaging agents were
not acutely toxic to retinal cells as
assessed by BrdU cell proliferation assays (Figure A,B). Cells exposed to up to 100 μM of HYPOX-1 or HYPOX-2
showed no significant decrease in cell proliferation, indicating that
these agents do not interfere with cell cycle and are safe at these
concentrations. Furthermore, TUNEL assays on retinas from mice intravitreally
injected with HYPOX-1 did not exhibit acute toxicity as indicated
by lack of TUNEL positive cells (Figure C).
These data confirm the safety of the HYPOX components, fluorescein
and nitroimidazoles, which have been administered to patients for
decades without associated toxicity.,,

R28 cells treated with (A) HYPOX-1 or (B) HYPOX-2 for
24 h show
no significant decrease in cell proliferation as indicated by a BrdU
incorporation assay. (n = 4), p &lt;
0.01. (C,D) A TUNEL assay was performed on cross sections of retinas
from adult C57BL/6 mice: (C) HYPOX-1 treated retina exhibits only
autofluorescence of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and lack
of TUNEL staining; (D) DNase treated cross sections were used as a
TUNEL-positive control. Scale bars = 100 μM.

In order to demonstrate the in vivo hypoxia selectivity
of these
imaging agents in the retina, HYPOX-1 and HYPOX-2 were administered
to mouse models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), which develop
avascular, hypoxic central retinas on P13 and are used to model ischemic
retinopathies observed in patients., Representative
ex vivo imaging of dissected retinal flatmounts from OIR mice exhibited
accumulation of intravitreally injected HYPOX-1 in central avascular
retinas which are hypoxic in these animals, as confirmed by positive
immunostaining for Pimonidazole adducts (Hypoxyprobe) in the same
region (Figure A,B). Intravitreally injected
HYPOX-1 did not accumulate in age matched control mice, which develop
fully vascularized retinas (Figure C), and
lack of Pimonidazole adduct staining was also confirmed in these retinas
(Figure D).

Retinal flatmounts of the OIR model, which
features avascular hypoxic
retina, exhibit colocalization of intravitreally administered HYPOX-1
and Pimonidazole. (A) HYPOX-1 in P13 OIR mouse retina. (B) Pimonidazole
immunostaining colocalizes with HYPOX-1 in OIR P13 retinas. (C,D)
Room air control mice which do not develop central avascular retinas
and subsequent hypoxia exhibited no detectable HYPOX-1 accumulation
or Pimonidazole staining.

Immunostaining of excised retinas with ICAM-2 was used to
identify
retinal vasculature and its association with HYPOX-1 and -2 accumulation.
As expected, intravenously or intravitreally injected HYPOX-1 or -2
accumulated in avascular regions not supplied by the ICAM-2 positive
blood vessels (Figure A,C). Control mice reared
in room air did not exhibit HYPOX-1 accumulation (Figure B). In some retinal regions in OIR mice, ICAM-2
positive blood vessels colocalized with HYPOX-1 or -2 fluorescence
emission. These observations are consistent with published reports
which indicate that blood vessels in the OIR mouse model on P12–P15
also exhibit some degree of hypoxia, since these fragile blood vessels
are often not well-perfused and lack adequate oxygen carrying capacity., However, as these compounds are intravenously injected, it is possible
that some intravascular trapping of HYPOX compounds may occur, which
warrants further investigation. These data demonstrate the specificity
of HYPOX probes for hypoxic tissue in vivo, and warrant further applications
involving in vivo retinal imaging instrumentation. In addition, HYPOX
accumulation in retinal tissue can be accomplished through intraocular
or intravenous injection routes. We are currently designing instrumentation
and protocols to enable visualization of in vivo administered HYPOX-1
and -2 in mouse models of retinal hypoxia.

Retinal flatmounts from
(A) OIR or (B) room air mice intravenously
injected with HYPOX-1 (green) were stained with the endothelial cell
marker ICAM-2 (red). (C) Retinal flatmount from OIR mouse intravitreally
injected with HYPOX-2 (green) and stained with ICAM-2 (red). Accumulation
of HYPOX-1 and HYPOX-2 is observed in the avascular retina. Scale
bars = 100 μM.

This work builds upon recently described approaches for imaging
hypoxia in other organs in animal models.− These innovative
imaging probes enable detection of hypoxia in cells or tissues via
FRET or nitroreductase bioreduction mechanisms. Our goal was to facilitate
translation of hypoxia imaging for ophthalmic examination, as no hypoxia
imaging agents have been tested in this setting. We have now contributed
an additional imaging contrast agent which enables the coupling of
the FDA-approved fluorescein to 2-nitroimidazole or Pimonidazole for
selective imaging of hypoxic cells in the retina. Further work remains
to compare the imaging agents described here and in the literature
to optimize dosage and imaging protocols for each contrast agent in
diverse imaging applications.

Conclusions
In this work we have
demonstrated a facile route for synthesis
of hypoxia-sensitive imaging agents based on biocompatible nitroimidazole
and fluorescein components. The imaging probes were capable of detection
of hypoxic retinal cells and tissues with high specificity and sensitivity.
This approach may be useful for studying the role of hypoxia in retinal
diseases, as well as diseases in other tissues featuring a hypoxic
component. Further studies are warranted to demonstrate amenability
of this approach for imaging hypoxia using in vivo imaging instrumentation
in animal models and patients.

timed pregnant females and adult female
mice 5–6 weeks of age were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.
All animal experiments were approved by the Vanderbilt University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Mouse Models
of Hypoxia for Ex Vivo Imaging
The mouse
model of oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) was selected as a mouse
model for hypoxia and generated as published. Briefly, litters with 6 to 8 pups were placed into a 75% oxygen
chamber with dams from P7–P12. On P12, pups were removed from
the hyperoxic environment to room air. Imaging agents, vehicle controls,
and dye controls were intravitreally injected (3 μg in 1 μL
injection volume) or intravenously injected via tail vein (60 mg/kg)
6 h after removal from hyperoxic environment. Pimonidazole hydrochloride
(Hypoxyprobe Inc.) was injected intraperitoneally at a concentration
of 60 mg/kg body weight.

Cell Culture
Primary
human Müller cells and
R28 cell line were grown in low glucose DMEM supplemented with 10%
Fetal Bovine Serum, 1× GlutaMAX, and 1× Penicillin–Streptomycin.
Human Retinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HRMEC) were grown in
Endothelial Cell Media (EBM) supplemented with EGM SingleQuots Kit.
All cells were maintained in a humidified environment with 5% CO2 at 37 °C unless otherwise noted. For hypoxia induction,
assay plates were placed into a humidified chamber and ambient air
was displaced with a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 at a flow rate of 20L/min for 5 min according to manufacturer instructions
and published methods. The chamber was
clamped and placed at 37 °C for the remainder of the time point.
R28 cells were treated with 100 μM Pimonidazole hydrochloride
diluted in complete media and subjected to hypoxia or normoxia for
4 h.

In Vitro Imaging Agent Uptake Assays
R28 cells or primary
human Müller cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells
per well in a 96-well black plate with clear bottom. When 90% confluent,
assay plates were either placed in hypoxia or kept in normoxia for
12 h. They were treated with imaging agents diluted in complete media
and returned to hypoxia or kept in normoxia for 30 min. They were
washed 4 times with prewarmed Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution
(HBSS), kept in normoxia for 1 h, and then washed 4 more times in
HBSS. Fluorescence intensity was read (Absorbance: 490 nm, Emission:
520 nm) using a Synergy Mx Plate Reader from Biotek.

Immunofluorescence
Analysis of Cells
R28 cells were
seeded at a density of 15,000 cells per well of 8-well chamber slides.
When 90% confluent, cells were treated with either imaging agent and
Pimonidazole hydrochloride or imaging agent only, diluted in complete
media, and placed in hypoxia or normoxia for 4 h. Cells were washed
4 times in HBSS, fixed for 10 min with 10% neutral buffered formalin
at room temperature, washed 3 times with tris buffered saline, and
mounted with Prolong Gold with DAPI mounting media.

Toxicity
Studies
A BrdU cell proliferation assay was
performed on R28 cells. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with the following specifications. Cells were seeded at 2000
cells/well in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours after seeding, the
cells were serum starved for 6 h. Imaging agents and vehicle controls
diluted in complete media were added and allowed to incubate for 24
h. Four hours prior to the end of the incubation, BrdU was added at
a concentration of 10 μM. An Alexa Fluor 647 Click-IT TUNEL
in situ detection kit was used on paraffin-embedded retinal sections
from adult mice according to manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies).
A DNase I treated slide was used as a positive control.

Immunofluorescence
Analysis of Retinal Tissues
Retinas
were dissected from ocular tissues and fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin for 2 h. Tissues were then rinsed in Tris buffered saline
and blocked/permeabilized in 10% donkey serum with 1% Triton X-100/0.05%
Tween 20 in TBS for 6 h. Retinas were then stained for ICAM-2 and
Pimonidazole adducts (Hypoxyprobe) followed by secondary antibody
staining as indicated. Images were taken using an epifluorescence
microscope.
