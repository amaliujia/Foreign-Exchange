Introduction
Biomedical molecular
imaging has evolved into a fast growing research
field with the aims to characterize molecular processes at the cellular
and subcellular level, using targeted vectors for in vivo imaging.− With the development of more specialized and sensitive technologies,
novel avenues allow biomedical researchers to interrogate biological
processes in vivo. Two of the most generally
used imaging technologies in biomedical research are positron emission
tomography (PET) and optical fluorescence imaging. Both technologies
have their own distinct characteristics, advantages, and limitations.
PET imaging is a highly sensitive technology, which uses the γ-rays
associated with positron annihilation events to localize positron
emitting targeted tracers inside an organism. The low interaction
of γ-rays in the human body allows physicians to accurately
detect signals in patients even if they originate deep below the body
surface. Based on physical limitations, however, PET systems only
have spatial resolutions in the millimeter range. Optical fluorescence imaging, on the other hand, has a
much lower tissue penetration due to the strong absorption of visible
and near-infrared (NIR) light in living tissues and can therefore
not be used as a whole body imaging technology in humans. However,
fluorescence images can be used to guide intraoperative procedures,
and can provide subcellular resolution for ex vivo imaging or for
in vivo window chamber imaging for preclinical research., The combination of these modalities in a bimodal imaging probe overcomes
the limitations of a single imaging technology and brings together
high resolution, high sensitivity, and deep tissue penetration.

Over the past few years, different strategies have been applied
to achieve multimodal capability of a molecular imaging agent.,, Based on these previous approaches,
we became interested in further exploring the scope, advantages, and
performance of dual-labeled PET/optical imaging probes. Specifically,
we aimed to design a dual-labeled agent for the glucagon-like peptide
1 receptor (GLP-1R) which is expressed on the membranes of β-cells
in the pancreas as well as by insulinomas, tumors arising from pancreatic
β-cells. The GLP-1R binding peptide exendin-4 has been used
to image insulinomas and β-cells in animals as well as humans
before,, as a fluorescent,, PET, or SPECT, imaging agent. Given the small
size of the exendin-4 peptide, we aimed to synthesize a bimodal imaging
tag for site-specific labeling at just one single site, which likely
has a less negative impact on binding than conjugating different imaging
modalities at different sites.

In order to characterize the
dual-labeled exendin-4 probe 64Cu-E4-Fl, we used 916–1
insulinoma xenografts as well
as transgenic mice with islet-specific expression of enhanced green
fluorescent protein (GFP). In these experiments we asked the following
questions: (1) Is it possible to design a bimodal imaging agent based
on exendin-4 with metabolic stability comparable to the monomodal
labeled counterpart? (2) Is this bimodal imaging agent, 64Cu-E4-Fl, binding to its target GLP-1R with high affinity? (3) Can
both PET as well as optical imaging be performed on a mouse which
has received an amount of imaging agent suitable for both modalities?

As a result of our findings, we showed that the 64Cu-radiolabeled
sarcophagine chelator is stable enough to allow for copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition. We synthesized the dual-modality
imaging agent 64Cu-E4-Fl via a one-pot protocol and confirmed
binding to GLP-1R in insulinomas as well as pancreatic β-cell
mass using PET and fluorescent imaging.

Results
The four-step
synthesis toward the sarcophagine-based and fluorescently
labeled copper chelator 5 is shown in the  (Scheme S1). In comparison
to previous approaches to functionalize sarcophagine,, we achieved alkylation of DiAmSar 1 with N-Boc-4-(bromo-methyl)-benzylamine in the presence of sodium carbonate,
which afforded the chelator 2 in 36% yield. After treatment
with trifluoroacetic acid, intermediate 3 was conjugated
to azido-PEG4-NHS ester, and monosubstituted product 4 was isolated in 61% yield. Finally, the chelator 4 was
conjugated with a commercially available NIR fluorophore, sulfo-Cy5-NHS
ester, in the presence of triethylamine. The fluorescently labeled
starting material for the copper-catalyzed cycloaddition was isolated
in 45% yield. All products were purified by HPLC and characterized
by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).

In our
current work, we used the GLP-1R targeting peptide exendin-4
(E4x12), which was modified at the K12 position with the unnatural alkyne-amino acid (S)-2-amino-4-pentynoic acid (Figure A).,, With the site-specific modification
of the peptide with an alkyne and the attachment of an azide functional
group to the chelator, we were able to perform a copper-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) between E4x12 and chelator 5, using standard cycloaddition reaction
conditions (buffered water, copper sulfate, ascorbic acid, room temperature)
(). We obtained Cu-E4-Fl 6 in 20% yield over 1 h. HPLC and ESI-MS confirmed the identity
of Cu-E4-Fl ().

and stability of 64Cu-5 in the presence of

The radiolabeled bimodal imaging agent 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 was synthesized using a one-pot synthetic
protocol (Figure B). First, the fluorescently
labeled sarcophagine 5 was complexed efficiently with 64Cu in 0.5 M
ammonium acetate buffer (radiochemical yield (RCY) ≥98%). The
resulting 64Cu-5 was subjected to CuAAC reaction
conditions using E4x12, copper sulfate, and ascorbic acid,
yielding the targeted bimodal imaging agent 64Cu-E4-Fl 6. 64Cu loading was required before azide–alkyne
conjugation to prevent saturation of the sarcophagine cage with cold
copper. The synthetic preparation of 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 can be achieved in 3 h (including radioisotope incorporation, copper(I)-catalyzed
[3 + 2] Huisgen cycloaddition, HPLC purification, evaporation of solvents,
and formulation of an injectable solution) with an isolated decay-corrected
RCY of 39%, a radiochemical purity ≥95%, and a specific activity
of 141 μCi/μg. HPLC chromatograms of 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 and its intermediates are shown in Figure C. Stability and competitive binding studies with 64Cu-5 were performed using an excess of CuSO4, ascorbic acid, or EDTA. The high stability of 64Cu-5 was measured over 4 h, showing that the chelator has a suitable
stability against trans-chelation (Figure D). Also, the sarcophagine cage shields 64Cu(II) from
reduction to 64Cu(I) by ascorbic acid which could potentially
lead to release of the PET radionuclide.

We evaluated the affinity
of Cu-E4-Fl 6 to GLP-1R
using an 125I-exendin-4 (9–39) competitive binding
assay (Figure A). In comparison to exendin-4 with an IC50 of 4.7 ±
0.8 nM, we observed a slightly higher IC50 value of 50.3
± 3.7 nM for our bimodal imaging tracer Cu-E4-Fl 6. The binding affinity of Cu-E4-Fl 6 was confirmed in
confocal cell imaging, where GLP-1R positive 916–1 insulinoma
cells showed strong uptake (Figure B). After
incubation with Cu-E4-Fl (10 nM or 100 nM, 90 min), cells were fixed
and stained with Cellomics blue whole cell stain (Thermo Scientific,
MA, USA), indicating internalization of the fluorescent imaging probe,
similar to what was seen previously. To
show GLP-1R specificity of Cu-E4-Fl, we preincubated 916–1
cells with an excess of unmodified peptide E4x12 (1 μM)
before incubation with Cu-E4-Fl and observed suppressed fluorescent
signal in the NIR (Figure B).

Similar to in vitro binding, ex vivo histology confirmed
the selectivity
of Cu-E4-Fl 6 to GLP-1R (Figure ). One of the goals of developing GLP-1R targeting imaging agents
is to use them as a β-cell targeting agent for delineating islets
of Langerhans from exocrine pancreas. To show that 64Cu-E4-Fl
is selective for GLP-1R in vivo, we injected the imaging agent in
MIP-GFP mice and let the agent circulate for 1 h, before nuclear cell
stain was injected, the mice sacrificed, and pancreata harvested for
histology. The GLP-1R targeted 64Cu-E4-Fl probe showed
a strong fluorescent signal in the 650 nm channel, colocalizing with
the islets of Langerhans, as indicated by GFP fluorescence and similar
to other GLP-1R imaging probes.,

of GFP (top right). Green and red signal accumulations demonstrate
islets of Langerhans. All images were acquired with an objective of
20×. Scale bar: 100 μm for all images.

In order to explore the potential applications of 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 for in vivo imaging, we first determined
the blood half-life of 64Cu-E4-Fl (Figure A). After tail vein injection of the imaging agent (30–35
μCi, n = 4), we observed a weighted t1/2 of 10.1 min. The half-life was fitted to
a two-phase exponential decay curve, resembling a multicompartment
model with a fast agent distribution and a slow agent elimination
phase.

PET images (4–5 h) of 916–1 tumor-bearing (&lt;2 mm)

of 64Cu-E4-Fl (335 ± 35 μCi) and E4x12 (100 fold excess) in 200 μL PBS (4% DMSO). (C) Tumor uptake
in nonblocked (1.1 ± 0.1%ID/g) and blocked (0.2 ± 0.1%ID/g)
PET images. (D) Biodistribution study with 916–1 tumor bearing
mice.

With the purpose of determining
the performance of 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 as a whole
body imaging agent, small animal
PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies were conducted using
female nude mice bearing a subcutaneous insulinoma xenograft. In PET
images, GLP-1R positive 916–1 tumors were easily visualized
(Figure B). Other studies have shown before
that exendin-4, and exendin-4 imaging agents are rapidly internalized into cells, which allows
imaging at later time points (5 h), when the probe had already cleared
from the vasculature. To show specificity of 64Cu-E4-Fl
toward GLP-1R in whole body PET imaging, we further conducted blocking
studies with unmodified peptide (100-fold excess). Small animal PET
images confirmed effective blocking of 916–1 tumor uptake.
Tumor ROI analysis of the PET data showed 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 uptake of 1.1 ± 0.1%ID/g without and 0.2 ± 0.1%ID/g
with preinjection of excess cold material (Figure C). Biodistribution data endorsed the observations derived
from the PET data, as tumor uptake of 0.9 ± 0.6%ID/g and 1.0
± 1.0%ID/g were observed after 2 and 8 h postinjection, respectively
(Figure D).

We next compared the two
different modalities of 64Cu-E4-Fl
at high resolution by using the radionuclide 64Cu for phosphor
autoradiography and the fluorochrome sulfo-Cy5 for fluorescent imaging
(Figure A)—both on identical histology
slides. First, phosphor autoradiography was performed with a pancreatic
section, followed by fluorescent imaging of the same histological
slide to record the fluorescent signals of GFP and 64Cu-E4-Fl.
At both low and high resolution, there was a good correlation of both
imaging modalities with regard to islet visualization. Intensity profile
analysis, however, shows that the alignment of GFP positive areas
and 64Cu-E4-Fl is more accurate than the alignment of GFP
positive areas and phosphor autoradiography. While the differences
are less apparent at low resolution (Figure A), the comparison at high resolution (Figure B) illustrates the stark differences between fluorescence and autoradiography.

Discussion
Over the past decades,
PET has become standard of care as a clinical
diagnostic tool, particularly in oncology. And while this technology
has accelerated the understanding and detection of malignant growth,− it cannot provide the high spatial resolution typically associated
with intravital imaging technologies. The
promise to merge the high spatial resolution of optical imaging probes
with the sensitivity and whole body imaging capabilities of PET imaging
motivated us in the design of multimodal imaging probes. In the past,
different approaches and platforms were utilized for the synthesis
of dual-modality PET/fluorescence imaging probes.− The challenge
in designing bimodal imaging agents is that the sensitivity of different
imaging modalities can vary by several orders of magnitude, and the
half-life and biological stability of the imaging modalities should
match each other. Also, modification of a targeted tracer with multiple
imaging tags is more likely to lead to steric hindrance and can thus
reduce the selectivity of an imaging probe. Compared to small molecules,
peptides, and large biomolecules, the modular design and multifunctionality
of nanoparticles enables the straightforward integration of different
imaging modalities into one imaging agent and has made them the most
commonly used platform for multimodal imaging agents.− However, the long circulation times of most nanoparticle-based imaging
agents and their tendency to be taken up by macrophages can be a disadvantage
for some clinical applications.

Based on the successful generation
of bimodal sarcophagine-based
imaging agents for peptides,,, we aimed to develop a bioorthogonal bimodal imaging probe that can
be conjugated site-selectively to a standard peptide. The bimodal
NIR and 64Cu bearing azide-modified linker 5 allows site-selective conjugation to a peptide without any protection/deprotection
steps, and without any chemical modification of the peptide after
solid phase synthesis and cleavage from the resin. This allows linker 5 to be used as a synthetic intermediate for one-step NIR/64Cu labeling of a variety of peptides, and could allow the
simultaneous labeling of multiple peptides with just one batch of 64Cu-5. The radiolabeled 64Cu-E4-Fl 6 is based on an alkyne-modified exendin-4 peptide, which
was successfully used in the past for multiple exendin-4 imaging agents.,,, Recently, Clardy et al. showed that different positions of alkyne
modifications in the peptide sequence lead to different binding affinities
of the molecular imaging agent, which
could be one of the reasons for the lower binging affinity of 64Cu-E4-Fl 6, compared to the original peptide
sequence.

To illustrate the advantages of a bimodal versus a
monomodal imaging
agent, we sectioned a MIP-GFP mouse pancreas after injection of 64Cu-E4-Fl. Distributed within the pancreas of mice, rats,
and humans are the islets of Langerhans, small cell clusters which
amount for approximately 1–2% of the pancreatic mass and contain
the targeted GLP-1R expressing β-cells. Most islets are small and have diameters of only hundreds of micrometers,
which makes them ideally suited to compare autoradiography and fluorescence
imaging. At low resolution (Figure A, upper
panels), both autoradiography and fluorescence are mostly colocalized,
indicating the bimodal imaging agent to be functional and intact.
Imaging at higher magnification (Figure A,
lower panels) and fluorescence intensity analysis (Figure B), however, show that NIR fluorescence intensity
aligns better with the GFP islet signal than autoradiography. This,
ultimately, illustrates the advantages of a bimodal imaging probe
versus a monomodal PET or optical probe. After a single injection
of 64Cu-E4-Fl, we were able to show that both PET imaging
as well as optical imaging is possible in the same animal, combining
the advantages of whole body and high resolution imaging.

In
conclusion, we have successfully developed an elegant, modular,
and efficient method for the synthesis of a GLP-1R targeted peptidic
bimodal PET/fluorescence imaging agent. We were able to conjugate
a fluorescently labeled 64Cu-chelated sarcophagine cage
to an exendin-4 based targeted vector. We found that the copper-catalyzed
[3 + 2] Huisgen cycloaddition does not result in quick trans-metalation
between natCu and 64Cu, resulting in good radiochemical
purity and specific activities for the PET/fluorescence imaging probe.
We demonstrated that 64Cu-E4-Fl is capable of delineating
GLP-1R expressing insulinoma with its whole body PET imaging tag and
also pancreatic β-cell mass with its high resolution, low penetration
optical imaging tag. We were able to show the advantages of optical
imaging compared to autoradiography at high resolutions, allowing
for more exact localization of imaging probes. We have shown that
bimodal NIR/64Cu labeling can be used to quickly design
bimodal imaging probes, and that both functionalities can be utilized
in one animal. Ultimately, we envision that probes like 64Cu-E4-Fl could be used as hybrid imaging probes in the clinic, allowing
the diagnosis of primary growths and metastases in a whole body imaging
setting as well as real-time detection of tumor margins, infiltrative
growth, or residual tumor cells in a surgical cavity.

Joyce (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA). The
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), penicillin
(100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and passaged regularly
at 50–60% confluence in a ratio of 1:2eVery 3–4 days.
The cells were used for in vitro binding assays and in vivo xenograft

cells were cultured according to the recommendations of American Type
Culture Collection and Caliper Life Sciences under 37 °C with

the receptor binding affinity of Cu-E4-Fl 6. HEK-hGLPR1R
cells were seeded in a 96 well plate (5.5 × 104 cells
per well) and grown at 37 °C for 48 h. After washing with binding
buffer (120 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 13 mM sodium acetate,
5 mM KCl, 1.2 g/L Tris, 2 g/L bovine selum albumin (BSA), and 1.8
g/L glucose, pH 7.6) the cells were cotreated with 30 pM of 125I-exendin-4 (9–39, PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) and Cu-E4-Fl (final
concentration range: 10–12–10–6 M). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, cells were washed with
PBS (3 × 150 μL) containing 1 mg/mL BSA, lysed (RIPA 1×
buffer, 15 min) and the radioactivity of contents were measured using
a Wallac 3″ 1480 Automatic γ-counter.

In Vitro Cell
Imaging
To determine in vitro probe uptake,
916–1 cells (2.5 × 105 per well) were seeded
in an 8-well chamber slide (Lab-TekII Chamber Slide) and incubated
at 37 °C for 48 h. Afterward the cells were incubated with just
Cu-E4-Fl (10 nM or 100 nM in PBS containing 3% DMSO, 37 °C for
90 min) or underwent a preincubation with E4x12 (1 μM
in PBS, 37 °C for 30 min, 1× wash with 250 μL medium)
before incubation with Cu-E4-Fl (10 nM or 100 nM in PBS containing
3% DMSO, at 37 °C for 90 min) in fresh media (250 μL).
After washing with growth media (150 μL) and PBS (2 × 150
μL), blue whole cell stain (Thermo Scientific Cellomics Whole
CellStain) was added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min.
The cells were washed with PBS (2 × 150 μL), fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde (150 μL), and agitated at room temperature
for 5 min. The wells were washed with PBS (150 μL) before removing
chambers and adding mounting media and coverslip. The cells were imaged
using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5 II).

Animals
All animal experiments and procedures were
carried out in accordance with the guidelines set by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Transgenic homozygous B6.Cg-Tg(Ins1-GFP)1Hara/J mice, which express
GFP under the control of mouse insulin 1 promoter (MIP-GFP), were
obtained from the Jackson laboratory and bred at 6–8 weeks
of age. The resulting litters were used for pancreatic β-cell
mass imaging. Female athymic nude mice (Taconic Lab; CrTac:NCr-Foxn1nu,
6–8 weeks, 20–22 g) were induced with tumors on the
right shoulder. 916–1 insulinoma cells (3.0 × 106) were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of media and matrigel (150 μL)
and injected subcutaneously to establish xenograft tumor mouse models
(&lt;2 mm tumor volume) after 3 weeks.

Blood Half-Life
Female nude mice (6–8 weeks, n = 4) were
injected with 64Cu-E4-Fl (30–35
μCi) in PBS (5% DMSO, 200 μL) via lateral tail vein. At
predetermined time points (2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and
180 min), a blood sample was obtained from the great saphenous vein
of each animal. The radioactivity of the blood samples was recorded
with a WIZARD2 automatic γ-counter from PerkinElmer
and the weights of collected blood samples were determined. The percentage
of tracer uptake expressed as a percentage injected dose per gram
(%ID/g) was calculated as the activity present in the blood weight
per actual injected dose, decay-corrected to the time of counting.

Biodistribution
916–1 tumor-bearing nude mice
were used for evaluating the biodistribution of 64Cu-E4-Fl
in the whole body. Mice (6–8 weeks, n = 12)
were injected with 64Cu-E4-Fl (30–40 μCi)
in PBS (5% DMSO, 200 μL) via tail vein injection. At predetermined
time points (2, 6, and 24 h after injection) the mice were sacrificed
by asphyxiation with CO2 and blood was collected via cardiac
puncture. Selected organs (tumor, heart, lung, spleen, pancreas, stomach,
small intestine, large intestine, kidney, liver, muscle, bone, and
tail) were harvested, weighed, and counted using a WIZARD2 automatic γ-counter from PerkinElmer. The percentage of tracer
uptake stated as percentage injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g)
was calculated as the activity bound to tissue per organ weight per
actual injected dose, decay-corrected to the start time of counting.

PET Imaging
Small animal PET imaging data were recorded
on a microPET Focus 120. 64Cu-E4-Fl (335 ± 35 μCi)
in PBS (4% DMSO, 200 μL) was injected into the tumor-bearing
nude mice (n = 7) via tail vein. At 5–6 h
after the injection, the mice were anesthetized with 1.5–2.0%
isoflurane (Baxter Healthcare) at 2 L/min in oxygen and PET images
were recorded over 10 min. An additional group of nude mice (n = 5) was injected with 64Cu-E4-Fl (335 ±
35 μCi) premixed with unlabeled exendin-4 (100-fold excess)
in PBS (4% DMSO, 200 μL) as a blocking agent and to determine
the specificity of E4 to GLP-1 receptors. Images were analyzed using
AsiPro VM software (Concorde Microsystems). Quantification of activity
concentration in the xenograft tumor was done by drawing region of
interests (ROIs) in four different slices and averaging the maximum
values.

Digital Phosphor Autoradiography of Histological Pancreatic
Slides
For digital autoradiography experiments, 64Cu-E4-Fl (335 ± 35 μCi) in PBS (4% DMSO, 200 μL)
was injected into transgenic B6.Cg-Tg(Ins1-EGFP)1Hara/J mice (n = 5) via tail vein. Hoechst 33342 nuclear cell stain (150
μL, 10 mg/mL) was injected 1 h after tracer injection and the
mouse was sacrificed after an additional 5 min. The harvested pancreata
were flash-frozen (dry ice) in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura
Finetek, Torrance, CA), cut into 10 μm sections, and exposed
to a phosphor-imaging plate (Fujifilm BAS-MS2325, Fuji Photo Film,
Japan) for 24 h at −20 °C. After completion of exposure,
the imaging plates were analyzed using a Typhoon FLA 7000 laser scanner
(GE Healthcare, Port Washington, NY) with 25 μm pixel resolution.

Fluorescence Microscopy of Histological Pancreatic Slides
The same slides were used both for digital autoradiography and
fluorescence microscopy. Histology images of 10 μm fresh-frozen
sliced sections were analyzed using an Olympus BX-60 microscope equipped
with a CoolSNAP EZ camera (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ) for fluorescent
pictures, a CC12 Soft Imaging Systems camera (Olympus, Hauppauge,
NY) for RGB pictures, a Olympus UPlanFl objective with 10× magnification,
and a Olympus UPlanApo objective with 20× magnification. Fluorescence
images were obtained using appropriate filter cubes for each wavelength
(Hoechst, GFP, and NIR fluorescence). A computer controlled motorized
stage allowed images of whole sections to be generated as a mosaic
with a 10× magnification with identical exposure time per frame.
MicroSuite FIVE software was used to fuse images and Adobe Photoshop
and Fiji software was used to manually adjust and analyze images.
