Introduction
Adenosine, a well-known
neuromodulator, exerts its physiological
effects through four subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) of G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs). Agonists and antagonists
of adenosine receptors have an enormous therapeutic potential for
both peripheral and central diseases, including cerebral and cardiac
ischemic diseases, sleep disorders, immune and inflammatory disorders,
Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and cancer. However, although medicinal chemistry for adenosine receptors
has been widely developed in recent decades, several adenosine receptor
ligands that entered clinical trials have elicited undesirable side
effects precluding their further development. Thus, the in vivo lack
of drug selectivity may lead to the inability of controlling receptor
activity in time and space. Interestingly, these kinds of drawbacks
can be addressed by means of photoisomerization, which for instance
was used as the basis to achieve temporal and local activation of
biologically active substances or their release from liposomes., Similarly, aryl diazo derivatives were designed to interconvert
between cis and trans forms upon
irradiation with UV-A light in order to produce differential effects
on ion channels, such as potassium channels., Azobenzene-based
photoswitches have also been used to control metabotropic glutamate
receptors at their orthosteric and allosteric sites. Overall, controlling drug activity with
light offers the possibility of enhancing pharmacological selectivity
with spatiotemporal patterns of illumination, thus enabling localized
drug effects and the application of dosing patterns.

We now describe a photoswitchable aryl diazo derivative
of a potent
but nonselective adenosine receptor agonist N6-2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyladenosine (APNEA 1), termed
MRS5543 2 (Figure ), which functions
as a photochromic adenosine receptor ligand showing differential pharmacodynamics.
The design approach was based on the observation that the N6 region of adenosine agonists can accommodate diverse substitutions
without losing the ability to bind to the receptors, while marked
effects on the pharmacological profile, either subtype selectivity
or efficacy at a given subtype, are observed following relatively
subtle structural changes of the N6 substituent. Interestingly, X-ray crystallographic analysis
of agonist- and antagonist-bound states of the A2AR indicated
a conformational reorganization of the second and third extracellular
loops (ELs) in an agonist-bound, active-like state. Hydrophobic N6 substituents of adenosine receptor
agonists interact largely with these regions of the receptor. Thus,
we hypothesized that the introduction of a trans–cis photoisomerizable azobenzene group fused with a sterically bulky
and extended N6 chain would have characteristic effects
on the agonist profile. Furthermore, in view of potential physiological
applications, the photochromic group of MRS5543 was designed to present
a red-shifted absorption spectrum with respect to regular, violet-excitable
azobenzene and a short-lived cis state in aqueous
medium that could rapidly back-isomerize to the initial trans isomer in the absence of illumination. Overall, here we aimed to demonstrate that photoinduced differential
pharmacological responses of this compound could be attained using
visible light and a single irradiation source.

Synthesis of MRS5543, 2. The photocommutable nucleoside
MRS5543 was synthesized in two steps using the nonselective adenosine
receptor agonist APNEA 1, an arylamine that could be
readily diazotized without the use of protecting groups.

Results
MRS5543 Synthesis and Photochemical
Characterization
The aryl diazo derivative MRS5543 was prepared
from commercially
available APNEA and purified to homogeneity using a modification of
previously reported methods. In brief,
the aryl amine of APNEA was diazotized and the resulting diazonium
salt coupled to p-(diethylamino)-benzene (Figure ). Subsequently, we undertook the photochemical
characterization of MRS5543 in solution. First, the steady-state absorption
spectra of this compound in DMSO and HBSS were measured (Figure A). They present similar maxima at λ = 430
(DMSO) and 460 nm (HBSS) arising from the well-known π →
π* transition of its trans-azobenzene moiety,
which is bathochromically shifted with respect to violet-excitable,
regular azobenzenes owing to the diethylamino substituent introduced. As such, trans → cis photoisomerization of MRS5543 should take place under
irradiation with blue-green visible light. However, no azobenzene
photoisomerization was observed by steady-state UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy upon illumination at λexc = 420–460
nm in DMSO and HBSS. This was ascribed to the short lifetime expected
for the photoinduced cis state of the compound due
to the azobenzene diethylamino substituent,, which would therefore lead to fast, spontaneous cis → trans back-isomerization in the dark.

spectra of trans-MRS5543 (5 μM) in DMSO (blue)
and HBSS (red). (B) Transient absorption spectrum at t = 0 of trans-MRS5543 (10 μM) upon pulsed
excitation at λexc = 460 nm and 25 °C (DMSO:

nm of trans–cis mixtures of MRS5543 prepared
by irradiation of the intitial trans state (10 μM)
with a single ns laser pulse (t = 0) at λexc = 460 nm and 25 °C (C: DMSO; D: HBSS). Solid thick
lines correspond to monoexponential fitting of the experimental data.

Transient absorption measurements
were conducted to dissect this
process. As shown in Figure , pulsed excitation
of MRS5543 at λexc = 460 nm in DMSO and HBSS resulted
in an immediate loss of trans state absorption at
λ = 440 nm, thus indicating the formation of the cis isomer of the switchable molecule. Because of the lower extinction
coefficient of this species within the 380–500 nm region with
respect to the trans state,, the transient absorption spectra at t = 0 shows
a large negative bleaching signal that mirror-images the steady-state
absorption spectra of trans-MRS5543 (Figure B). Once produced, the cis isomer
of the compound rapidly returned to the trans state
via thermal back-isomerization, which allowed the initial absorption
at λ = 440 nm to be recovered in the second (in DMSO) and subsecond
(in HBSS) time scales, as shown in Figure C,D. Thermal cis state lifetimes were determined
from monoexponential fits of the experimental absorption recovery
curves (τ = 430 and 0.70 ms in DMSO and HBSS, respectively)
and they were in agreement with those reported for similar azobenzene
systems in polar media., Such short lifetimes
should enable photodriving the system with a single irradiation source,
since the photoinduced cis molecules should immediately
relax back to their trans state when switching off
the illumination.

Light-Mediated Modulation of MRS5543 Intrinsic
Activity
Once the capability of MRS5543 to photoisomerize
was demonstrated,
we aimed to assess the ability of both cis and trans isomers to modulate adenosine receptor functioning.
Since we used APNEA (a nonselective adenosine receptor agonist initially
used to characterize the A3R) as the chemical template for the synthesis of MRS5543, it was necessary
to evaluate its intrinsic activity at this Gαi/o coupled
adenosine receptor subtype. Therefore,
we assessed A3R-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
activity upon MRS5543 challenge both in the dark (i.e., trans isomer) and during cis photoconverting conditions
(i.e., continuous 460 nm irradiation). Both isomers of MRS5543 were
equally able to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation to the
same extent as APNEA (Figure ). Indeed, cis and trans MRS5543 showed similar potency
(EC50) and efficacy (Emax)
values in modulating adenylyl cyclase activity in cells expressing
A3R (Table ), thus suggesting that
MRS5543 photoisomerization did not alter its A3R agonist
efficacy.

Effect of MRS5543 in A3R-mediated cAMP accumulation.
HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the human A3R and the forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was measured in the
absence (basal) or presence of APNEA (20 nM), MRS5543 (20 nM), or
MRS5543 (200 nM) both in dark conditions (white column) and upon irradiation
at 460 nm (purple column). Data (means ± SEM of triplicates)
are given as percentage of the forskolin stimulated cells in basal
and dark conditions. No significant differences were found when dark
vs 460 nm conditions were compared within each treatment (two-way
ANOVA with a Bonferroni posthoc test). N.S., not significant. Similar
results were obtained in three independent experiments.

(EC50) Values and Maximum Responses (Emax) of APNEA and MRS5543 Modulating Adenylyl Cyclase
Activity in Transfected HEK293 Cells Expressing the Indicated Adenosine
Receptor
The maximal efficacy (Emax) of MRS5543 in modulating adenylyl cyclase activity
through the A3R and A2AR is compared to that
observed for APNEA. Also, for each compound (i.e., APNEA and MRS5543)
the impact of 460 nm irradiation into the EC50 and Emax was analyzed. N.D. non determinable.

P &lt; 0.05 vs
APNEA.

Next, we aimed to
study the intrinsic activity of MRS5543 at a
different APNEA-sensitive adenosine receptor, the A2AR.
Thus, under the same experimental conditions MRS5543 dose-dependently
induced cAMP accumulation in dark conditions (EC50 = 150
± 50 nM) (Table ), indicating a partial
agonist behavior when compared to APNEA-mediated full activation of
the A2AR (Figure , Table ). Unexpectedly, when A2AR-expressing
cells were continuously irradiated at 460 nm (i.e., cis photoconverting conditions), MRS5543 was unable to trigger activation
of the A2AR (Figure ) (Table ). Hence, these results demonstrated that while
the trans isomer partially activated the A2AR, the cis isomer was inactive.

MRS5543-dependent photomodulation
of A2AR-mediated cAMP
accumulation. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the human
A2AR and the cAMP production was measured in the absence
or presence of increasing concentrations of MRS5543 both in dark conditions
(white circles) and upon irradiation at 460 nm (purple circles). APNEA
(1 μM) was used as a positive control of A2AR-mediated
cAMP accumulation. Data (means ± SEM of triplicates) are given
as fold over the basal activity. Similar results were obtained in
three independent experiments.

Subsequently, we aimed to elucidate the lack of intrinsic
activity
of the cis MRS5543 isomer. Thus, the potential neutral
competitive antagonist activity of this molecule was evaluated. To
this end, the ability to compete with a prototypical, orthosteric
A2AR full agonist, 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl-ethylamino]-5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS21680), was assessed. Interestingly,
when A2AR expressing cells were challenged with CGS21680,
cAMP accumulation was observed under both dark and irradiating conditions
(Figure ). This A2AR agonist intrinsic
activity was blocked by 4-[2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a][1,3,5]triazin-5-yl-amino]ethyl]phenol (ZM241385), a selective
A2AR antagonist (Figure ). On the
other hand, incubation of cells with CGS21680 plus MRS5543 in the
dark (i.e., trans MRS5543, partial agonist) prompted
a partial A2AR activation, while under cis photoconverting conditions MRS5543 was able to completely block
CGS21680-mediated cAMP accumulation. These results suggested that
the trans MRS5543 (i.e., partial agonist) would in
fact act as a limited competitive A2AR antagonist in the
presence of a full agonist (i.e., CGS21680), thus reducing the potency
of CGS21680 with a concomitant net decrease in the activation of the
A2AR, and importantly confirming that the cis-isomer behaved purely as a competitive antagonist (Figure ). Overall, we concluded that both MRS5543 isomers
showed agonist activity at the A3R while the cis and trans isomers of MRS5543 showed antagonist
and partial agonist activity at the A2AR, respectively.

MRS5543 cis isomer blocks A2AR-mediated
cAMP accumulation. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with
the human A2AR and the cAMP production was measured upon
stimulation with the A2AR agonist CGS21680 (500 nM) alone
or in the presence of ZM241385 (1 μM) or MRS5543 (3 μM)
both in dark conditions (white columns) and upon irradiation at 460
nm (purple columns). Data (means ± SEM of triplicates) are given
as percentage of the CGS stimulated cells in dark conditions. The
asterisks denote data significantly different when dark vs 460 nm
was compared. ***P &lt; 0.001, two-way ANOVA with
a Bonferroni posthoc test. N.S., not significant. Similar results
were obtained in three independent experiments.

Molecular Modeling of MRS5543 Docking at Human A3R and
A2AR
The putative binding conformations
of MRS5543 cis and trans isomers
in complex with A3R and A2AR were evaluated
through molecular modeling studies. In particular, a recently reported
agonist-bound human A2AR crystallographic structure (PDB
ID: 3QAK) and a homology model of the human A3R, built using this A2AR
structure as a template, were used to perform docking simulations
of both isomers. The multiply substituted agonist ligand present in
this A2AR crystal structure (6-(2,2-diphenylethylamino)-9-((2R,3R,4S,5S)-5-(ethylcarbamoyl)-3,4-dihydroxytetra-hydrofuran-2-yl)-N-(2-(3-(1-(pyridin-2-yl)piperidin-4-yl)ureido)ethyl)-9H-purine-2-carboxamide, UK-432097) contained a bulky N6 substituent, which displaced EL3 to open the binding site
and to allow recognition of other N6 substituted nucleosides.

The docking poses of each MRS5543 isomer inside the A3R and A2AR binding sites (Figure ) preserved most of the main receptor–ligand interactions
of ribose and adenine moieties observed in the agonist-bound A2AR crystal structures., In particular, the
3′- and 2′-hydroxyl groups formed H-bonds with hydrophilic
residues (using a GPCR numbering convention) at positions 7.42 (Ser277 in A2AR and Ser271 in A3R) and 7.43 (His278 in A2AR and His272 in A3R), respectively. Furthermore, a threonine residue at position
3.36 (Thr88 in A2AR and Thr94 in A3R) formed
a H-bond with the 5′-hydroxymethyl group of the ligand. The
side chain of asparagine 6.55 (Asn253 in A2AR and Asn250
in A3R) strongly interacted with the compound through two
H-bonds involving the 6-amino group and the N7 atom of the adenine
ring. Moreover, the adenine core was anchored inside the binding site
by a π–π stacking interaction with a phenylalanine
in EL2 (Phe168 in A2AR and Phe168 in A3R) and
strong hydrophobic contacts with leucine 6.51 (Leu249 in A2AR and Leu246 in A3R) and isoleucine 7.39 (Ile274 in A2AR and Ile268 in A3R). Even though the interactions
formed by the two isomers with the residues of the lower part of the
ARs binding sites were very similar, some differences were observed
when considering the interactions with the upper part of the cavity
and the loop region.

is highlighted. A detailed view of the region around EL3 of the A3R (B) and A2AR (C) is shown. The Connolly surface

is displayed. Surface color indicates hydrophobic regions (green),
mildly polar regions (blue), and H-bonding regions (magenta). The
docking poses of MRS5543 trans and cis isomers (in green) inside the binding site of the A3R
(D) and A2AR (E) is shown. Side chains of some amino acids
important for ligand recognition and H-bonding interactions are highlighted.
Hydrogen atoms are not displayed.

As shown in Figure , at both the
A2AR and A3R, the N6 substituent
of the
MRS5543 trans isomer was directed toward the outside
of the cavity, and it was predicted to make contact with residues
of EL2. However, no significant differences were seen in the interactions
of MRS5543 with the two receptor subtypes. In contrast, the N6-substituent of the cis isomer impinged on
top of the binding site entrance, and its orientation and interactions
were particular for each receptor subtype, mainly due to differences
in the residues present in the upper region of the binding sites (Figure B,C). Interestingly, at the A2AR structure,
the distal p-diethylaminophenyl moiety was able to
fit a subpocket located under EL3 and between TM6 and TM7, delimited
by Ile252 (6.54), Phe255 (6.57), Thr256 (6.58), Pro260 (EL3), Cys262
(EL3), His264 (EL3), Ala265 (EL3), and Met270 (7.35) (Figure C,E). On the other hand, at the A3R structure
there was no side pocket between TM6 and TM7 able to accommodate the p-diethylaminophenyl group (Figure B,D), and this determined a different orientation of the N6 substituent. This substituent was located more external to the binding
cavity and able to adopt different poses (Figure D).

In fact, as shown in Figure , the region
around EL3 at the A3R is narrower and not suitable to accommodate
the N6 substituent, as compared to that of the A2AR, which shows an opening under the loop. This is mainly due to the
fact that EL3 of the A3R is shorter (5 residues long) in
comparison to EL3 of the A2AR (8 residues long) (Figure A). Moreover, in the A2AR EL3 presents
a disulfide bridge (Cys259-Cys262), and two proline residues that
confer more rigidity to the loop and potentially stabilize it in a
conformation that leads to the formation of the subpocket between
TM6 and TM7. Interestingly, mutagenesis studies at the A1R showed that mutation of the two proline residues in EL3 affects
basal activation levels and agonist potency at this subtype, suggesting
that rigidity in EL3 is an important feature in receptor activation. Our previous study on a series of 4′-truncated
(N)-methanocarba-adenosine derivatives also highlighted the importance
of specific interactions of the N6-substituents with the
region located between TM6 and TM7 in determining different affinity
and selectivity profiles at ARs. Overall,
some differences were observed for the two MRS5543 isomers over A3R and A2AR subtypes that could be related to structural
differences in the EL3 region of these receptors and its ability to
interact with the N6 substituent, thus having potential
implications for ligand binding and/or receptor activation.

Discussion
The use of photoisomerizable receptor ligands was first designed
for operating with fast ion channels,− while its application
to GPCRs has been much more recent., Recently, azobenzene
moieties were incorporated into bioactive peptides and cyclopeptides
that act through GPCRs as conformational probes to establish relationships
with its bioactivity. Here, we synthesized
a chemically stable arylazo derivative MRS5543 of a known nonselective
adenosine receptor agonist as a pharmacological tool for probing the
dependence on receptor affinity and efficacy of conformational effects,
particularly by direct contact with the extracellular regions of the
receptor. Thus, we fused a commonly used photoisomerizable azobenzene
moiety to a known GPCR pharmacophore, i.e., APNEA, with the expectation
that it would interact with conformationally sensitive regions of
adenosine receptors. The distal azobenzene moiety that was fused also
contained a p-diethylamino group that increased the
reactivity of this moiety toward diazonium salts and the water solubility
of the final product, which was not expected to prevent receptor binding.
In addition, this substituent also red-shifted the absorption spectrum
of the azobenzene unit and decreased the thermal stability of its cis isomer, thus enabling operation of the system with visible
light and a single irradiation source. Importantly, the N6 moiety of adenosine receptor agonists is known to be amenable to
extensive structural variation while retaining receptor interactions.
Moreover, this substituent class is known to associate with a conformationally
plastic and potentially functionally important region of adenosine
receptors. On the other hand, we used an X-ray structure of the A2A receptor and a well-validated homology model of the closely
related A3 receptor to predict differential interactions
of cis and trans isomers. By basing
the design of MRS5543 on APNEA, it was possible to achieve high affinity
of the diazo derivative at both A2A and A3 receptors.

Evidence is increasing that plasticity of the ELs may have implications
for the activation of GPCRs. Interestingly, here we characterized
the effects of distinct cis and trans isomers of this nucleoside on the adenylyl cyclase system. However,
the effects on other effector systems that may be coupled to these
adenosine receptor subtypes are unknown and would not necessarily
follow the same characteristic patterns we revealed. For instance,
it is known that APNEA exerts A2AR-dependent effects in
rat cortical synaptosomes through N-type calcium channels. However, it is not known whether isomers of
MRS5543 would exert differential effects in that model. Also, we did
not evaluate the effects at the A1 or A2B receptors;
APNEA binds with moderate affinity to the A1 but not to
A2B receptors., Therefore, although
we were able to provide detailed information on A3R and
A2AR activity, it is necessary to be aware that more work
is still needed to elucidate a detailed understanding of the recognition
of cis and trans stereoisomers of
MRS5543 at adenosine receptor subtypes in both activated and basal
states.

In conclusion, we presented here the first photochromic
adenosine-based
compound, a visible (less harmful) light-switchable, azobenzene-containing
adenosine receptor ligand whose intrinsic activity is light-moldable.
The design strategy for this compound was facilitated and results
interpreted with the aid of a recently determined X-ray structure
of an adenosine receptor. With the surge of new X-ray structures reported
for GPCRs, it seems reasonable that similar
approaches could be used for many other receptors (GPCRs), which are
indeed the mechanistic framework for many of the pharmaceuticals on
the market. Accordingly, our application of ligand photomodulation
to this important class of signaling proteins, demonstrating the feasibility
of modulating metabotropic receptors by small molecules using light,
could serve as a model for a much broader application of this kind
of approach. We envision its application both in pharmacological tool
compounds and potentially in therapeutic agents toward the goal of
achieving a site- and time-specific action.

Experimental
Procedures
Synthesis of MRS5543
All reagents and solvents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). 1H NMR
spectra were obtained with a Bruker 400 spectrometer (Bruker Corp.,
Billerica, MA, USA), and chemical shifts are expressed in δ
values (ppm) with tetramethylsilane (δ 0.00). Analytical TLC
was performed using glass sheets precoated with silica gel F254 (0.2
mm) from Sigma-Aldrich. The purity of final nucleoside derivative
was shown to be &gt;95% (detection at 254 nm) using a Hewlett–Packard
1100 HPLC equipped with a Zorbax SB-Aq 5 μm analytical column
(50 × 4.6 mm; Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Mobile phase: linear gradient solvent system, 5 mM TBAP (tetrabutylammonium
dihydrogen phosphate)–CH3CN from 80:20 to 0:100
in 13 min; the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. Peaks were detected by UV
absorption with a diode array detector at 230, 254, and 280 nm.

N6-2-(4-{(E)-[4-(Diethylamino)phenyl]diazenyl}phenyl)ethyladenosine
(MRS5543, 2) was synthesized as follows (Figure ). APNEA (10 mg, 25.8 μmol, 1) was dissolved in hydrochloric acid solution (20% of 12 M hydrochloric
acid in water; 200 μL) and the solution cooled to 0 °C
using an ice bath with vigorous stirring. A solution of sodium nitrite
(2.0 mg; 28 μmol) in water (10 μL) was then added and
the solution stirred at 0 °C for 20 min to allow formation of
the diazonium salt to occur (Figure , step
1). During this time, N,N-diethylaniline (5.0 μL;
33 μmol) (Figure ) dissolved in methanol
(5 μL) and sodium hydroxide (10% soln. in water; 200 μL)
(Figure , step 2) was cooled to 0 °C.
This solution was then added dropwise to the preformed, cooled diazonium
salt solution in the dark, and the solution was adjusted to neutrality.
The solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (10 mL); the organic
layer was separated, washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate
solution (2 × 10 mL) and brine (1 × 10 mL), dried (MgSO4), and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give a
yellowish brown solid. This solid was purified by semipreparative
silica gel plate chromatography (5:1 dichloromethane: methanol). Evaporation
of the solvents provided the title compound as a homogeneous yellow
solid (7 mg, 50%). δH (CD3CN): 8.26 (1H,

Photochemical Characterization of MRS5543
Steady-state
absorption measurements were registered in a UV–vis HP 8453
spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO,
USA). Transient absorption measurements were performed by means of
a LKII laser flash photolysis spectrometer (Applied Photophysics,
Surrey, UK) equipped with a Xe lamp, a monochromator, and a photomultiplier
(PMT) tube (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The 20 ns pulsed
laser beam arising from an Rainbow OPO (Quantel, Les Ulis, France)
pumped by a Nd:YAG Brilliant laser (Quantel) was used to excite the
solutions of interest at 460 nm and 1 mJ/p. The signal from the PMT
tube was collected in a 500 MHz oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies,
Inc.) and transferred to an Accorn PCRisk station. In this way the
decay kinetics of photogenerated transient species at selected wavelengths
could be measured and subsequently analyzed by means of nonlinear
least-squares exponential fittings.

Plasmid Constructs
The use of the A2ARRluc was
previously described, and the A3RRluc construct was obtained using standard
molecular biology
techniques and the cDNA encoding the human A3R gene as
a template. Briefly, the human A3R sequence was amplified using the sense oligonucleotide primer
FA3XhoI (5′-CGGCTCGAGATGCCCAACAACAGCACTGCTC-3′)
and the antisense primer RA3BamHI (5′-GCGGGATCCCGCTCAGAATTCTTCTCAATGCTTGTGTCC-3′).
The fragment was then subcloned in-frame into the XhoI/BamHI sites of the pRluc-N1 (Packard
Bioscience, Madrid, Spain), resulting in the A3R with Renilla luciferase at its C-terminus (A3RRluc). All constructs were verified
by nucleotide sequencing.

Cell Culture and Transfection
Human
embryonic kidney
(HEK-293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
2 mM l-glutamine, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected
with TransFectin Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA).

MTT Viability Assay
The impact of MRS5543 treatment
and 460 nm irradiation on cell viability was examined by MTT assay.
In brief, HEK-293T cells were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h. Cells
were treated during 2 h with increasing concentrations of MRS5543
with and without irradiation at 460 nm by using a custom-made 9 ×
4 light-emitting diode (LED) matrix (12 × 9 cm) (FCTecnics, Barcelona,
Spain) installed in the culture hood at height of 2 cm above the cells.
Subsequently, the cells were washed and incubated for 2 h in the dark
at 37 °C with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) (Sigma-Aldrich). Following the lysis of the cells the
cell viability was determined by measuring the absorbance at 560 nm.
Interestingly, the MRS5543 treatment (ranging from 10 nM to 3.3 μM)
did not affect the cell viability in either dark or upon 460 nm irradiation
conditions ().

cAMP Assay
We used a dual luciferase reporter assay
to indirectly detect variations of cAMP levels in transiently transfected
HEK-293T cells. Accordingly, cells were seeded at a density of 1 ×
106 cells/well in 6-well dishes, and co-transfected with
2 μg of the plasmid encoding the cAMP response element–firefly
luciferase fusion protein (pGL4-CRE-luc2p; Promega, Madison, WI, USA)
plus 2 μg of plasmid encoding either A2ARRluc or A3RRluc, approximately 36 h after transfection and then treatment with the
indicated ligand during 2 h in the presence of 50 μM zardaverine
and with and without irradiation at 460 nm. Cells were then harvested,
washed twice with PBS, and the firefly luciferase luminescence (FLU)
determined using the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega)
following the manufacture’s indications. The Renilla luciferase luminescence (RLU) was determined
by incubating the cells with 5 μM of benzyl-coelenterazine (NanoLight
Technology, Pinetop, AZ, USA). Both firefly
and Renilla luminescence was measured
in a POLARstar Optima plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Ortenberg,
Germany) using a 30 nm bandwidth 535 nm filter setting. The firefly
luciferase activity was normalized against Renilla luciferase values (i.e., FLU/RLU) for each data point.

The statistical analysis was performed by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni posthoc test. Statistical significance
was set as P &lt; 0.05.

Molecular Modeling
The adenosine derivatives (prepared
for docking using the build panel and the LigPrep panel implemented
in the Schrödinger suite) were
docked in an agonist-bound structure of the human A2AR
(PDB code 3QAK) and in a model of the closely related
human A3R. More precisely, a model of the hA2AR was built, using the homology modeling tool implemented in the
MOE suite, to fill the portion of EL2
that is missing in the crystal (from Gly142 to Leu167). Coordinates
for these residues were taken from another agonist-bound hA2AR crystal structure (PDB code 2YDV). The human
A3R homology model was built using MOE suite, as previously reported,, based on the human A2AR structure as a template.

Glide module of the Schrödinger suite was used for the docking
in the rigid binding site using the SP (standard precision) procedure.
A Glide Grid was centered within key conserved residues of the binding
pocket, i.e., Phe (EL2), Asn (6.55), Trp (6.48), and His (7.43). The
Glide Grid was built using an inner box (ligand diameter midpoint
box) of 6 Å × 6 Å × 14 Å and an outer box
that extended 20 Å in each direction from the inner one. The
top scoring docking poses for each ligand were subjected to visual
inspection and analysis of protein–ligand interactions to select
the proposed binding conformations.
