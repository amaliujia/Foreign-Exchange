Introduction
Phenotypic
differences between normal and malignant cells form
the basis for cancer-selective targeting of imaging and therapeutic
agents. Proteins overexpressed on the cell surface have received considerable
attention in that regard because of their accessibility relative to
intracellular targets, particularly for bulky and/or charged multimodality
imaging and multifunctional therapeutic agents. Accordingly, this
has resulted in developing various affinity agents including antibodies,
antibody fragments, aptamers, peptides, and small molecules in addition
to refining the mechanisms of their attachment to imaging agents,
drugs, and nanoparticles.

Cancer cell surface proteins have
been used extensively for diagnosis,
staging, and therapeutic monitoring., For example,
patients with prostate cancer are beginning to benefit from targeted
affinity agents for improved imaging of local and metastatic disease,
and for detection and isolation of circulating tumor cells.− Those cancer-selective surface markers, including but not limited
to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), hepsin, chemokine
receptors such as CXCR4, and integrin-αvβ3, are overexpressed in different stages and phenotypes of
prostate cancer., Here we focus on developing imaging
agents that target two disparate surface targets, to enable imaging
of tumor cells that might possess one but not the other. Recently,
rational multitargeting strategies have emerged based on the hypothesis
that simultaneous targeting of multiple sites promises a greater overall
therapeutic impact compared to targeting a single site.− The concept of targeting more than one cell surface protein for
imaging purposes has been demonstrated by Gillies and coworkers using
a heterobivalent (HtBv) agent that enables dual recognition of human
melanocortin and cholecystokinin receptors both in vitro and in vivo., Dual targeting of integrin-αvβ3 and gastrin releasing peptide receptor
(GRPR) using several imaging modalities has also been demonstrated.− There are several advantages to multitargeting approaches. First,
they can improve the sensitivity of detection through synergistic
increase of binding affinities to targets. Second, the specificity
of detection can be enhanced. Third, one can use a single agent to
target multiple surface markers that are differentially expressed
on cancer cells with progression of the disease.

PSMA is a type
II transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed
in prostate cancer, particularly in metastatic and hormone-refractory
disease. Small molecules have been developed
to target PSMA selectively for imaging with single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and
optical imaging− with several radionuclide-based agents proceeding to clinical trials., PSMA has been targeted to deliver therapeutic nanoparticles both
in experimental models and in cancer patients. In addition to prostate cancer, PSMA is overexpressed in
tumor neovasculature, a property that can be leveraged for imaging
a wide variety of tumors.−

Integrins, a family of
transmembrane proteins, have been found
to be dysregulated in several varieties of cancer as well as in other
disorders such as inflammation and fibrosis. They are involved in
a variety of activities that occur between cancer cells and their
surrounding environment., One target for imaging
cancer is αvβ3 integrin, and we
have employed a standard affinity agent to enable its imaging in this
report. We have chosen this target in part because of its diverse
functions related to tumor progression, and also because it is expressed
in tumor neovasculature, as is PSMA.− As such, αvβ3 integrin provides a reasonable cotarget
along with PSMA for tumor neovasculature. Notably, other functions
of αvβ3 integrin include cancer
cell migration and metastasis. Because
of these important roles in cancer, and its presence on tumor neovasculature,
αvβ3 integrin has been a frequent
target for the development of site-directed molecular imaging agents,
many of which incorporate the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) binding motif.

Here we describe a multitargeting strategy
utilizing PSMA and αvβ3 integrin
simultaneously. We synthesized
a dual PSMA/αvβ3 integrin targeted
imaging agent by incorporating a low-molecular-weight, urea-based
PSMA inhibitor and a cyclic RGD (cRGDfK) peptide into the same construct.
The HtBv probe was then conjugated to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid (DOTA) or to a commercially available near-infrared light-emitting
dye (IRDye800CW) to enable its ultimate use for imaging and/or radiometal
therapy. The binding of the DOTA-conjugated derivative was compared
to the corresponding monomeric DOTA-conjugated compounds using several
biochemical assays against both surface proteins. In addition we used in situ ligand minimization in an attempt to predict the
mode of binding of the DOTA-conjugated HtBv agent 9 to
its protein targets. Lastly, we used the IRDye800-conjugated agent 10 for optical imaging of either PSMA or αvβ3 overexpressing xenografts by observing its target-specific,
dose-dependent uptake.

Experimental Procedures
Chemistry
All
commercial starting materials were used
without further purification. Protected amino acids were purchased
from ChemImplex (Wood Dale, IL), DOTA-NHS ester was obtained from
Macrocyclics (Dallas, TX), IRDye800CW-YC27 and IRDye-800CW NHS ester
were obtained from LI-COR (Lincoln, NE), and glycine loaded 2-chlorotritylchloride
resin (0.51 mmol/g, 100–200 mesh) was obtained from AAPPTec
(Louisville, KY). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Milwaukee, WI). Reaction products were purified using semipreparative
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by structural
elucidation using NMR and/or ESI-MS. A Bruker UltraShield 400 MHz
spectrometer was used to obtain 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm downfield
from proton resonance resulting from incomplete deuteration of CDCl3, which was used as the NMR solvent. Low resolution ESI-MS
spectra were obtained using a Bruker Daltonics Esquire 3000 Plus spectrometer
(Fremont, CA). ESI-MS characterization is described for all newly
synthesized intermediates and final compounds in Table . Semipreparative HPLC purification was performed utilizing
a Waters 600E Delta LC system with a Waters 486 variable wavelength
UV/vis detector, both controlled by Waters Empower software (Milford,
MA), and a semipreparative Phenomenex column [5 μ, C18(2), and
250 × 10 mm] (Torrance, CA). Solvent-A was 0.1% TFA in water
whereas solvent-B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. Purification required
a compound-optimized gradient with flow rate of 4 mL/min and detection
at 220 and 254 nm. The purity of the isolated key intermediates and
the final compounds was further confirmed using the same HPLC conditions.
Several elution gradient methods were developed: Method-1: from 95%
to 75% solvent-A over 20 min; Method-2: from 90% to 70% solvent-A
over 20 min; and Method-3: from 85% to 55% solvent-A over 30 min.
Method-4 was run from 70% to 50% solvent-A over 20 min, employing
detection at 210 and 220 nm. For compounds conjugated to IRDye800,
Method-5 was developed with an isocratic elution of 80% solvent-A
for 2.5 min followed by a gradient to 60% solvent-A over 10 extra
min and to 80% solvent-A for 2.5 min with a flow rate of 6 mL/min
and detection at 220 and 700 nm. Analytical HPLC characterization
(tR) is given in Table  for all synthesized intermediates and final compounds. In
the case of IRDye800 conjugates, the quantity obtained was determined
using a standard calibration curve of the relationship between concentration
and absorbance at both 700 and 750 nm. The calibration curve was constructed
by measuring the absorbance of serial dilutions of the IRDye800-NHS
ester at both 700 and 750 nm using a ND1000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington,
DE) (). Peptide synthesis was
executed using a CEM Liberty microwave peptide synthesizer (Matthews,
NC) and PepDriver software.

Synthesis of EUKL-NH2 (2)
The
amine-terminated intermediate 2 was obtained from the
corresponding protected NHS ester 1, which was synthesized
as previously reported. Compound 1 (74 mg, 100 μmol) was reacted with N-boc-1,4-diaminobutane (19 mg, 100 μmol) and TEA (20 μL)
in CH2Cl2 (2 mL). The reaction was monitored
using ESI-MS and evaporated under vacuum upon completion. The crude
product was deprotected by stirring in 1:1 TFA/CH2Cl2 (2 mL) at ambient temperature for 2 h. The final product
was obtained by evaporation under vacuum followed by semipreparative
HPLC (Method-1) affording 25 mg (45 μmol, yield = 46%).

Synthesis
of EUKL-DOTA (3)
Intermediate 2 (8 mg, 14 μmol) was dissolved in 300 μL DMF
to which 30 μL diisoproylethylamine (DIPEA) was added. To the
aforementioned solution, DOTA-NHS ester (10 mg, 14 μmol) was
added. The reactants were mixed thoroughly and kept at ambient temperature
for 2 h. The conjugation reaction was monitored using ESI-MS. Compound 3 was purified using HPLC (Method-2), which, following lyophilization,
afforded 5 mg (5.3 μmol, yield = 38%).

Synthesis of cRGDfK-NH2 (4)
Intermediate 4 was
synthesized using microwave assisted
solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) following a published procedure,
starting with 0.49 g of glycine-loaded 2-chlorotritylchloride resin
(255 μmol). The fully protected,
open peptide was cyclized using diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) and
NaHCO3. A mixture of the crude
protected acyclic peptide (1 equiv, 90 μmol, 100 mg), NaHCO3 (5 equiv, 450 μmol, 36 mg), DMF (100 mL), and DPPA
(3 equiv, 270 μmol, 80 mg) was stirred overnight. Upon confirming
the completion of cyclization by ESI-MS, the solvent was evaporated
under vacuum and deprotection was performed without purification using
a mixture of TFA, H2O, and TES (95:2.5:2.5). The reaction
mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the final product was purified
using HPLC (Method-2) generating 36 mg of pure peptide (60 μmol,
overall yield = 24%).

Synthesis of cRGDfK-DOTA (5)
Intermediate 4 (4.2 mg, 7 μmol) was conjugated
with DOTA-NHS ester
(6.4 mg, 8 μmol) using a conjugation procedure similar to that
for 3. Compound 5 was obtained after HPLC
purification using Method-2 (5.5 mg, 5.5 μmol, yield = 79%).

Synthesis of cRGDfK-IRDye800 (6)
Intermediate 4 (0.5 mg, 0.8 μmol) was conjugated with 0.5 mg IRDye800CW
NHS ester (0.4 μmol) in a mixture of 100 μL DMSO and 5
μL DIPEA. Reactants were mixed thoroughly for 2 h at ambient
temperature. The conjugated derivative 6 was purified
using HPLC (Method-5) to yield 200 nmol (yield = 50%), quantified
using a standard calibration curve ().

Synthesis of Bis(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) 3-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)pentanedioate (7)
Boc-protected
β-glutamic acid was prepared from β-glutamic acid following
a previously reported procedure. The
crude boc-protected β-glutamic acid (400 mg, 1.62 mmol) was
dissolved along with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 2.2
equiv, 409 mg, 3.56 mmol) in 6 mL anhydrous DMF. To this mixture,
3-(ethyliminomethyleneamino)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine hydrochloride (EDAC.HCl, 2.2 equiv, 684 mg,
3.56 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred for 48 h at ambient
temperature. The solvent was then evaporated under vacuum, 0.1 N HCl
was added to the residue, and extraction using ethyl acetate was performed
(3×). Organic fractions were combined, washed with water, NaHCO3, NaCl; dried using anhydrous Na2SO4; and concentrated under vacuum. The residue obtained was purified
by HPLC (Method-4) to yield a white solid (100 mg, yield = 15%). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ-4.51 (m, 1H, CHNH boc),
3.05 (m, 4H COCH2), 2.83 (s, 8H, succinimide), and 1.437
(s, 9H, t-butyl). 13C NMR (CDCl3): δ 168.83
(4C, succinimide carbonyl groups), 166.04 (2C, OCO), 154.78 (1C, NHCOO),
80.25 (1C, OCH), 44.35 (1C, NHCH), 34.87 (2C, COCH2), 28.29 (3C, CH3),
25.59 (4C, succinimide methylene groups, CH2CH2).

Synthesis of EUKL-cRGDfK-NH2 (8)
To a solution of 7 (3.5 mg, 8 μmol) in 250 μL
DMF and 25 μL DIPEA, a solution of 2 (5 mg, 9 μmol)
and 4 (5.5 mg, 9 μmol) in 250 μL DMF was
added. The reaction mixture was left for 2 h at ambient temperature
and then concentrated under vacuum. The boc-protected intermediate
was deprotected in situ without purification using
500 μL of a mixture of TFA, H2O, and tetraethylsilane
(TES) (95:2.5:2.5). The reaction mixture was concentrated and the
final intermediate 8 was purified using semipreparative
HPLC (Method-2) affording 5 mg (4 μmol, yield = 50%).

Synthesis
of EUKL-cRGDfK-DOTA (9)
The
DOTA-conjugated HtBv agent 9 was synthesized via the conjugation of intermediate 8 (2 mg,
1.5 μmol) and DOTA-NHS ester (1.4 mg, 1.8 μmol) according
to the procedure described for 3. The reaction mixture
was concentrated and the target compound was purified using HPLC (Method-3)
providing 2 mg (1.2 μmol, yield = 80%).

Synthesis
of EUKL-cRGDfK-IRDye800 (10)
The IRDye800-conjugated
HtBv agent 10 was synthesized via the
conjugation of intermediate 8 (1 mg,
0.7 μmol) and IRDye800CW NHS ester (0.5 mg, 0.4 μmol)
in 100 μL DMSO and 5 μL DIPEA. After 2 h at ambient temperature,
the conjugated derivative 10 was purified using HPLC
(Method-5) to yield 40 nmol (yield = 10%), quantified using a standard
calibration curve of the dye ().

NIR Cell-Based Binding Assays
PSMA-positive (PC-3/PIP)
and PSMA-negative (PC-3/flu) sublines were generously provided by
Dr. Warren Heston (Cleveland Clinic). Both cell lines were grown in
F-12K medium (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) containing 10% FBS (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and Pen-Strep (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA).
Human glioblastoma U87-MG cells, reported to express αvβ3 integrin, generously
provided by Dr. John Laterra (Johns Hopkins University), were grown
in MEM medium (Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10%
FBS and Pen-Strep. All cell cultures were maintained at 5% carbon
dioxide (CO2) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.
All cell-based experiments were performed using the Nunc Edge 96-well
plates (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) in order to prevent differential
evaporation rates from the inside to the outside wells, which cause
variation in the rate of cell growth between the peripheral and the
internal wells of the plate. PSMA+ PC-3/PIP and PSMA- PC-3/flu cells
were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well
and incubated for 24 h prior to the binding experiment (binding isotherm
or competitive binding). Binding experiments to PC-3 cells were conducted
in the same media used to support their growth. After adding the indicated
amount of compound, cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37
°C in a humidified incubator for 30 min. Cells were washed twice
using serum-free media followed by reading the near-infrared (NIR)
optical signal of the entire plate using Odyssey NIR imaging system
version 3.0 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). About 8 × 104 U87-MG
cells were plated per well on the same 96-well plate and incubated
for 48 h prior to the binding experiment. In contrast to the conditions
adopted for binding to PC-3 cells, binding experiments for U87-MG
cells were conducted in binding buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM
NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 25 °C prior
to washing twice using cold binding buffer followed by reading the
NIR signal of the entire plate. The DOTA-conjugated
compounds were allowed to compete against a fixed concentration of
an NIR-emitting agent. In the case of targeting PSMA expressed on
the surface of PC-3/PIP cells, IRDye800-YC27 was used (). For
targeting αvβ3 integrin expressed
on the surface of U87-MG cells, 6 was used. The NIR signal
was recorded using the LI-COR Odyssey NIR imaging system version 3.0,
preset using the microplate option and with the following parameters
assigned during measurement: resolution = 169 μm, medium quality,
focus offset = 3 mm, intensity = 800, channel = 7. All measurements
were performed in quadruplicate.

Binding Isotherms
In order to determine the dissociation
constant (Kd) of a NIR agent with respect
to binding to its target cells, a binding isotherm was constructed
by measuring the uptake of serially diluted solutions of the agent
against a fixed number of cells. The binding isotherms of IRDye800-YC27
to PC-3/PIP (test binding), PC-3/flu (biological nonspecific binding),
and the plate (physical nonspecific binding) were recorded. Similarly,
the binding isotherm of 6 to U87-MG cells was recorded.
Binding isotherms were constructed by plotting the concentration of
the agent (nM) against the measured integrated fluorescence intensity.
The binding isotherms were fitted using nonlinear regression with
a one site binding module available in GraphPad Prism version 4.00
for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Z-Factor
Calculations
Two plates were used to measure
the maximum signal produced by the binding of 10 nM IRDye800-YC27
to 3 × 104 PC-3/PIP cells/well, whereas two plates
were used to measure the minimum signal resulting from blocking the
binding of 10 nM IRDye800-YC27 by 10 μM of 2-[3-[1-carboxy-5-(4-iodobenzoylamino)-pentyl]-ureido]-pentanedioic
acid (DCIBzL) as a high-affinity PSMA binding agent. The readings were processed using the following equation
in order to compute the Z-factor:where μC+ is the mean of the maximum signal and μC– is the mean of the minimum signal, ρC+ is the standard deviation of the maximum
signal, and ρC– is the standard deviation of the minimum signal.

Competitive
Binding Inhibition
The Mnv and HtBv compounds
were tested for their ability to displace the corresponding NIR agent
from the respective protein target expressed on the cell surface.
Serial dilutions of 10 000, 1000, 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, and
0 nM of each test compound were prepared. One experiment was executed
against 10 nM of IRDye800YC27 using PC-3/PIP cells whereas the other
was performed using 50 nM of cRGDfK-IRDye800 (6) and
U87-MG cells. The competitive binding curves were fitted using nonlinear
regression analysis and IC50 values were assigned when
50% of the corresponding agent was displaced.

PSMA Binding
Assay
To compare the PSMA functional inhibition
of 9 to its Mnv analog 3 and a positive
control (DCIBzL), a fluorescence-based glutamate-hydrolysis inhibition
assay was implemented according to a published procedure (Amplex red
assay). All dilutions were performed
in quadruplicate. The binding curves were fitted as described above.

αvβ3 Integrin Binding Assay
A fluorescence polarization assay was used to generate binding
affinities of HtBv and Mnv compounds to αvβ3. Compound 3 and
IRDye800-YC27 were used as negative controls. 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein-cRGDfK
(cFl-cRGDfK) was synthesized for use as a fluorescent
probe against which compounds 9 or 10 (HtBv)
and 5 or 6 (Mnv) compete (). All dilutions were tested in quadruplicate. The
binding curves were fitted using nonlinear regression as above.

Molecular Modeling
All molecular modeling experiments
were performed using Discovery Studio 3.1 developed by Accelrys, Inc.
(San Diego, CA).

Protein and Ligand Structure Preparation
The X-ray
structure of PSMA co-crystallized with the competitive inhibitor DCIBzL
(PDB: 3D7H)
was downloaded from the protein data bank (RCSB, http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do). The water molecules were removed
while the co-crystallized ligand was used as a template to sketch 3 and 9 using the Sketch Molecules module in
Discovery Studio. An αvβ3 integrin
X-ray structure co-crystallized with a cyclic-RGD derivative (PDB: 1L5G) was also obtained
from RCSB. The water molecules were eliminated
and the co-crystallized ligand was used to sketch 5 and 9.

In Situ Ligand Minimization
Each ligand
was minimized while binding to its target protein using the in situ ligand minimization module with the following parameters:
CHARMm as an input force field, minimization algorithm as smart minimizer,
maximum minimization steps equal to 1000, minimization with RMS gradient
equal to 0.001 Å, and minimization energy change set equal to
zero. After the minimization protocol was executed, the in
situ minimized ligands were stripped of their nonpolar hydrogens
to simplify the overall view. The protein was depicted in the form
of a light gray line ribbon. The binding pocket of a protein target
was surrounded with a gray sphere. The bound ligand is depicted as
a stick with atoms color-coded according to element: carbon (gray),
nitrogen (blue), and oxygen (red).

Preliminary in
Vivo Optical Imaging and ex Vivo Biodistribution
Animal studies were undertaken
in compliance with the regulations of the Johns Hopkins Animal Care
and Use Committee. Male (6- to 8-week-old), non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe-combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington,
MA) were used for the current investigation and are classified into
three groups, three mice in each. Group-1 was implanted subcutaneously
(s.c.) with U87-MG cells at the back right flank (2.7 × 106 cells in 100 μL of 1× HBSS). Group-2 was implanted
s.c. with PC3-PIP and PC3-flu cells (3 × 106 and 2.25
× 106 cells respectively each in 100 μL of 1×
HBSS) at the back right and left flanks, respectively. In both group-1
and group-2, tumors were allowed to grow for 10 days before injection
of the experimental agent. In both groups, mouse 1, 2, and 3 received
2 nmol, 1 nmol, and 0.5 nmol of the HtBv agent 10, respectively.
In the case of group-3, the mice were implanted s.c. with U87-MG cells
at the back right flank (2.7 × 106 cells in 100 μL
of 1× HBSS). U87-MG tumors were allowed to grow for 15 days before
subcutaneously implanting PSMA+ PC3-PIP cells (3 × 106 cells in 100 μL of 1× HBSS) at the back left flank, and
PSMA- PC3-flu cells (2.25 × 106 cells in 100 μL
of 1× HBSS) at the back right leg. Group-3 mice were allowed
to grow PC3-PIP and PC3-flu tumors for an additional eight days before
injecting the experimental agent(s). For group-3, mouse 1 received
1 nmol of the HtBv agent 10, mouse 2 received 1 nmol
of 10 coinjected with 100 nmol of DCIBzL (to assess PSMA-binding
specificity), and mouse 3 received a mixture of 1 nmol of 10 and 300 nmol of 5 (to assess αvβ3-binding specificity). For a given single injection per one
mouse, all experimental agent(s) were dissolved in 100 μL of
preservative-free 0.9% NaCl injection, USP as a sterile diluent and
then injected intravenously (i.v.) via the lateral
tail vein. Images were acquired after 24 h postinjection (PI) using
the Pearl Imager (LI-COR Biosciences). The Pearl Imager uses diffusive
lasers optimized for IRDye800CW incorporated in the 10. The instrument deploys a CCD camera with a field-of-view of 11.2
× 8.4 cm at the surface of the imaging bed. The scan time was
less than 30 s for the 800 nm channel image acquisition. Images are
displayed using a pseudocolor output with a corresponding scale. For
all groups, images were acquired at the same parameter settings. For
each group, all images were scaled to the same minimum and maximum
values. Imaging bed temperature was adjusted to 37 °C. Animals
were anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane through a nose cone
connected to the imaging bed. For ex vivo biodistribution
studies of group-3, animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation
at the end of acquisition of the in vivo images. Ex vivo images were acquired by harvesting liver, spleen,
gastrointestinal tract (GIT), kidneys, urinary bladder, heart, lungs,
muscle, U87-MG, PC-3-PIP, and PC-3-flu tumors and displaying them
on plastic Petri dishes before imaging using the same acquisition
parameters implemented for the relevant in vivo imaging.

Results
Chemistry
Mnv agents EUKL-DOTA 3, cRGDfK-DOTA 5, and cRGDfK-IRDye800 6 were synthesized as
outlined in Schemes  and . They represent the controls to which the in vitro binding affinities of the labeled HtBv agents could be compared.
EUKL-DOTA 3 was synthesized using the reported NHS-ester 1, which was conjugated with N-boc-1,4-diaminobutane
followed by global deprotection and a final conjugation step with
DOTA-NHS ester (Scheme ). For targeting αvβ3 integrin,
cRGDfK-NH24 was synthesized using a published
microwave-assisted SPPS procedure. Both
DOTA- and IRDye800-conjugated Mnv targeted probes 5 and 6 were synthesized by reacting intermediate 4 with either DOTA-NHS or IRDye800-NHS, respectively, under appropriate
conditions (Scheme ).

Scheme  illustrates the synthetic
route
for key intermediate 8, which can be used to generate
two final, conjugated HtBv agents: DOTA-conjugated 9 or
IRDye800-conjugated 10 (Scheme ). The synthetic route of 8 began with the generation
of a heterotrifunctional linker 7, from β-glutamic
acid, which can be used to assemble HtBv agents via conjugation with basic amine-terminated probes (pKa &lt; 10). Simultaneous mixing of equivalent amounts
of the two amine-terminated probes with the di-NHS ester intermediate 7 proved critical to obtain the HtBv conjugate as a major
product and to minimize the formation of homobivalent side products.

NIR Cell-Based Binding Affinity Measurement
The commercially
available IRDye800-YC27 was used to measure the binding of DOTA-conjugated
Mnv and HtBv agents to PSMA expressed by PC-3/PIP cells, while 6 was used to measure the binding of DOTA-conjugated Mnv and
HtBv agents to αvβ3 integrin expressed
by U87-MG cells. Prior to the competitive
binding experiments, the binding isotherm of each NIR agent to its
target cells was constructed in order to calculate the Kd (). As illustrated
in , IRDye800-YC27 can saturate
PSMA expressed on the surface of PC-3/PIP cells in a concentration-dependent
fashion typical of specific binding, with a maximum signal of integrated
fluorescence intensity equal to about 1,000. IRDye800-YC27 demonstrated
a Kd of 23.8 nM, with a 95% confidence
interval (95%-CI) of 23 to 26.5 nM (R2 = 0.99). cRGDfK-IRDye800 (6) can saturate αvβ3 integrin expressed on the surface of U87-MG
cells with a maximum signal of integrated fluorescence intensity equal
to about 270 and a Kd equal to 117 nM,
with a 95%-CI of 63–171 nM (R2 =
0.92) (). We further validated
the consistency of the PC-3/PIP cell-based assay by measuring the
Z-factor () as a gauge of the
quality of the newly developed cell-based assay (Z-factor = 0.723).

To assess whether 9 retained
affinity to PSMA compared to its Mnv control (3), a serial
dilution of each compound was allowed to compete against 10 nM of
IRDye800-YC27 for binding to PC-3/PIP cells. Results are graphically
presented in Figure A and numerically described
in Table . DCIBzL, a known, high-affinity PSMA ligand, was used as a positive control.
The coincidence of the 95%-CI of the IC50 values presented
by 3 and 9 indicates that the covalent linkage
of cRGDfK does not significantly affect the binding of the EUKL moiety
to PSMA within a cellular environment. Analogously, Figure C and Table  suggest that 9 can compete against 50 nM of 6 over binding
to αvβ3 integrin on U87-MG cells,
as much as Mnv 5, which is indicated by the coincidence
of the 95%-CI of the respective IC50 values of both compounds
(5 and 9).

PSMA Binding
Assay
To confirm the results obtained
by the NIR intact cell-based competitive binding assay measuring the
affinities of 3 and 9 toward PSMA overexpressed
on PC-3/PIP cells, a fluorescent protein-based assay was performed. The IC50 values obtained for the
Mnv and the HtBv compounds (Table  and Figure B) were similar, and their 95%-CI coincide. This
finding indicates that the covalent linking of the cRGDfK moiety does
not affect the affinity of the HtBv compound to PSMA, as long as the
urea-based scaffold is efficiently delivered to the deep PSMA binding
site using a linker of suitable length. The order of magnitude difference in the IC50 values
obtained from protein-based vs cell-based assay results from the difference
in processes measured, namely, the ability of the test compound to
inhibit the hydrolysis of N-acetylaspartylglutamic
acid (NAAG) (Km = 1.15 μM) in the
amplex red assay vs its displacement of IRDye800-YC27 (Kd = 24 nM) in cellulo.

αvβ3 Integrin
Binding Assay
More accurate measurement of the affinity of
several control and
test compounds toward binding αvβ3 integrin was needed in lieu of the weak correlation
between the obtained and fitted data of the NIR cell-based testing
attempted for U87-MG cells (R2 = 0.67
for 9, Table ). For that purpose
a fluorescence polarization assay was employed. The results of screening six compounds using this method
are included in Table , illustrated in Figure D. Compound 3 and IRDye800-YC27 were
screened as negative controls, and neither bound to αvβ3 integrin in this assay. On the other hand, HtBv
compounds 9 and 10 showed similar competitive
binding behavior to that exhibited by their respective Mnv controls, 5 and 6. The obtained results support the conclusion
that the incorporation of the EUKL moiety along with cRGDfK using
a short linker does not alter the binding of the latter to αvβ3 significantly. This fluorescence polarization
assay is compatible with screening IRDye800-conjugated compounds because
the measurement of the fluorescence polarization of cFl-cRGDfK, using
excitation at 492 nm and emission at 519 nm, exhibits no interference
by the optical properties of IRDye800 in the NIR region.,

Prediction of the Binding Mode of 9 to Its Individual
Targets
In an attempt to visualize how 9 is
capable of recognizing both targets without decreasing binding affinity
to either PSMA or αvβ3 integrin,
a series of in situ ligand minimization experiments
were conducted using Discovery Studio. This algorithm minimizes the
agent built within the binding domain of a given protein structure.
Figure  shows the results of two individual
minimization experiments in which either 3 or 9 was subjected to the minimization procedure using a reported PSMA
X-ray crystal structure, 3D7H. The linker
is predicted to deliver either the DOTA moiety in 3 (Figure A), or the β-glutamic acid linker carrying
both the DOTA and cRGDfK moieties in 9 (Figure B), to the space just outside of the active site
of PSMA while at the same time satisfying the binding requirement
between the urea and the zinc within the binding site. Figure C shows the Mnv and the HtBv probes superimposed
upon one another, further depicting the tolerance of 9 to addition of bulky cRGDfK and DOTA, since these latter two moieties
lie outside of PSMA entirely.

used 3D7H X-ray coordinates of PSMA. The protein is presented as light

compound 3 (blue) and compound 9 (cyan).

The binding site of cRGDfK peptide,
which is within the interface
between the αv and β3 subunits,
presents sufficient space for the accommodation of HtBv probes. This space between the two subunits may explain
why the inclusion of both the EUKL and/or the DOTA does not impair
the binding of the cRGDfK moiety to αvβ3 integrin. This is manifested visually in Figure . Compound 9 projects the PSMA targeting
moiety away from the αvβ3 integrin
surface (Figure B).

Preliminary in
Vivo Optical Imaging and ex Vivo Biodistribution
of 10
After
evaluating the ability of 9 to bind to its targets (Figure ) in vitro, a pilot in
vivo study was necessary to test the ability of the HtBv
probe to be useful for delivering imaging agents to tumors that may
express different levels of PSMA and/or αvβ3 integrin. Compound 10 was tested for selective
uptake by PSMA+ PC3-PIP, PSMA- PC3-flu, and αvβ3 integrin-expressing U87-MG cells subcutaneously transplanted
in mice. Figure  shows the direct relationship
between the tumor uptake and the injected dose of 10 in
two different xenograft models: group-1 mice transplanted with U87-MG
tumor and group-2 mice transplanted with PC3-PIP and PC3-flu tumors.
In order to test the specificity of the uptake of 10 by
either PC3-PIP tumor (PSMA mediated) or U87-MG tumor (αvβ3 integrin mediated), a blockade experiment
was performed after developing an in vivo system
that harbors all three tumor types concurrently (group-3). A mouse
injected with 10 without blocking agent showed strong
uptake in both PC3-PIP and U87-MG but not in PC3-flu tumor (Figure  A1 and B1). Blockade with 100 nM DCIBzL (a selective
PSMA ligand) or with 300 nM of 5 (a Mnv, integrin-αvβ3-targeted agent) significantly reduced
the uptake of 10 by PC3-PIP (Figure  A2 and B2) or by U87-MG (Figure  A3
and B3), respectively. These data suggest that 10 exhibits
blockable uptake within both PC3-PIP and U87-MG tumors indicating
binding specificity to each type of tumor.

3 received 0.5 nmol of the HtBv agent 10. Ventral (animal
supine) views were obtained at 24 h postinjection. Images were scaled
to the same maximum and minimum values (arbitrary units) for each
group.

300 nmol compound 5 (Mnv integrin-αvβ3 agent). Ventral (animal supine) views were obtained

Discussion
Heteromultivalency provides agents that
bind to more than one individual
target, perhaps concurrently, but also
independently, as long as one affinity moiety does not interfere with
binding of the other to its corresponding target. Multivalency and
particularly heteromultivalency attempts to unite at least two separate
targeting moieties that will not only be additive but may synergize
either by allowing increased avidity to the overall cellular or tissue
target or by enabling a statistically greater likelihood of interaction
with the overall target. A multivalent agent may be needed in the
context of cancer imaging or therapy, for example, in which a tumor
may alter its phenotype midway through therapy, losing one target
while preserving the other. Excellent reviews on multivalency exist.− Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of an HtBv ligand targeting
PSMA and αvβ3 integrin, two targets
expressed in certain, specific types of tumor epithelium, but also
broadly on most solid tumor neovasculature, where such a HtBv agent
may find useful clinical application.

In contrast to homomultivalency,
in which multiple copies of the
same probe, aiming at a single target, are covalently linked together
to increase the overall avidity toward the target cell, heteromultivalency,
targeting two different surface proteins, may or may not aim at increasing
the avidity. Avidity, the affinity of a multivalent agent, can be
enhanced by receptor clustering or through increased local concentration
of the HtBv agent in the proximity of cells expressing one or more
of the intended targets.,

Despite the fact
that both PSMA and αvβ3 are localized
to the cell surface, the location of the binding
site in each case is different, necessitating a different strategy
for covalently linking the two targeting moieties. Targeting αvβ3 by cRGDfK can be achieved superficially
at the interface between the αv and the β3 subunits and requires a linker to the imaging moiety to be
no longer than the side chain of lysine. On the other side, the urea binding site lies deep within PSMA and
requires a linker of approximately 20 Å in length to deliver
the binding urea-based scaffold to its cognate site. It is important to stress that the aforementioned 20 Å
linker was implemented in the current work with the intention to deliver
the PSMA targeting urea to the binding site deep within PSMA rather
than allowing the HtBv agent to bind simultaneously to both PSMA and
αvβ3.

For the purpose of covalently
linking both EUKL and cRGDfK, a linker
that offers three points of attachment is needed: one point for each
targeting moiety and the third to attach an imaging moiety or other
construct such as a nanoparticle, toxic species, or other. β-Glutamic
acid can offer the above possibilities. Two carboxylic acid groups
can be converted into NHS esters while the amino group is orthogonally
protected.

In construction of an HtBv ligand the covalent modification
by
which two targeting moieties are linked should have a minimal effect
on the binding of each moiety to its respective target. We took a
graded approach by evaluating binding first in cellulo using an equilibrium saturation analysis for targeting PSMA. Concerning
αvβ3, a radiometric cell-based assay
has been widely used in measuring the affinity of αvβ3 targeting probes on a cellular level using U87-MG
glioblastoma cells known to express αvβ3., The results obtained and depicted by Figure A,C indicate that 9 is able to recognize
both PSMA and αvβ3in cellulo. As shown in Table , the coincidence of
95%-CI of the IC50 values computed for 9 and
its respective Mnv control further supports the last notion. Different
accuracy of the nonlinear regression fit of the competitive blockade
for the PC3-PIP (PSMA) system versus the U87-MG (αvβ3) system, as indicated by the R2 of the IC50 values of 3 and 9 against IRDye800-YC27 (0.98 and 0.99, respectively) vs the R2 of the IC50 values of 5 and 9 against 6 (0.83 and 0.67, respectively),
was observed. One of the underlying reasons for this disparity could
be that the two experiments were conducted using cells that were treated
differently. The PC3-PIP cells have been engineered to overexpress
PSMA, while the αvβ3-positive control
cells, U87-MG, naturally express the target sought after—and
likely at lower levels than PSMA is expressed in the transgenic line.
Nevertheless, specific binding of the HtBv agent 9 to
PSMA was further confirmed by a fluorescence-based functional inhibition
assay, while binding of the same agent and 10 to αvβ3 was confirmed by a cell-free, protein-based
fluorescence polarization assay (Table ).

In both cases, in situ ligand minimization experiments
show that the second targeting moiety protrudes outside of the protein
target into the surrounding aqueous environment. Both EUKL and cRGDfK
moieties exhibit high water solubility, minimizing the enthalpic consequences
of their association with that environment. Additionally, the short
β-glutamic acid linker minimizes the entropic cost that would
be conferred by a longer linker. Pilot in vivo optical
imaging of the dose-uptake relationship (Figure ) of compound 10 by different xenograft models expressing
either target protein supports the in vitro results
(Figure ). Selective blockade of the PC3-PIP
tumor uptake of 10 by cotreatment with an excess of the
known PSMA ligand DCIBzL, and of U87-MG tumor uptake of 10 by a c-RGDfK carrier (5), as illustrated by Figure , further supports the dual targeting capacity of 10 with specificity.

Conclusions
PSMA and integrin-αvβ3 are overexpressed
in primary tumors, neovasculature, and metastatic lesions, suggesting
that they may be used concurrently as a more powerful mechanism by
which to target imaging agents to tumors—particularly tumor-associated
neovasculature. Compound 10 was capable of binding productively
to each target in vitro and in xenograft models. In situ ligand minimization experiments offer an explanation
of the binding data, where the EUKL and cRGDfK moieties productively
occupy positions either outside the two units forming αvβ2 or PSMA, respectively. The current HtBv
design in which the two targeting moieties and a radiometal chelator
or an optical dye were attached via a short linker
provides a single molecule capable of identifying two structurally
and functionally different cancer-selective surface proteins. DOTA-conjugated 9 will be used for the preparation of radiolabeled derivatives
for quantitative biodistribution studies as well as additional imaging
and radiotherapeutic applications in the future.
