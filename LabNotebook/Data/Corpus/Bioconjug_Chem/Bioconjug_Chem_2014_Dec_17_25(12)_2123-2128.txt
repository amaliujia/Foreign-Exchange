The complementary nature of positron
emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging (OI) has fueled increasing
interest in the development of multimodal PET/OI probes that can be
employed during the diagnosis, staging, and surgical treatment of
cancer. Due to their high selectivity and affinity, antibodies have
emerged as promising platforms for the development of hybrid PET/OI
agents. However, the lack of specificity of many bioconjugation reactions
can threaten immunoreactivity and lead to poorly defined constructs.
To circumvent this issue, we have developed a chemoenzymatic strategy
for the construction of multimodal PET/OI immunoconjugates that have
been site-specifically labeled on the heavy chain glycans. The methodology
consists of four steps: (1) the enzymatic removal of the terminal
galactose residues on the heavy chain glycans; (2) the enzymatic incorporation
of azide-bearing galactose (GalNAz) residues into the heavy chain
glycans; (3) the strain-promoted click conjugation of chelator- and
fluorophore-modified dibenzocyclooctynes to the azide-modified sugars;
and (4) the radiolabeling of the immunoconjugate. For proof-of-concept,
a model system was created using the colorectal cancer-targeting antibody
huA33, the chelator desferrioxamine (DFO), the positron-emitting radiometal 89Zr, and the near-infrared fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 680.
The bioconjugation strategy is robust and reproducible, reliably producing
well-defined and immunoreactive conjugates labeled with 89Zr, Alexa Fluor 680, or an easily and precisely tuned mixture of
the two reporters. In in vivo PET and fluorescence
imaging experiments, a hybrid 89Zr- and Alexa Fluor 680-labeled
huA33 conjugate displayed high levels of specific uptake (&gt;45%
ID/g) in athymic nude mice bearing A33 antigen-expressing SW1222 colorectal
cancer xenografts.

Introduction
Over the past 30 years,
molecular imaging has transformed cancer care. The ability to noninvasively
acquire anatomical and functional information about tumors has aided
clinicians in all stages of cancer management, from diagnosis to staging
to treatment.1−3 While the vast majority of imaging agents are specific
to a single modality, recent years have played witness to a surge
in the development of multimodal probes.4−7 In this regard, the complementary nature
of positron emission tomography (PET) and optical imaging (OI) have
made hybrid PET/OI probes particularly promising tools. While PET
radiopharmaceuticals enable noninvasive whole body imaging and provide
functional and anatomical information about lesions, near-infrared
fluorescence (NIRF) optical imaging probes facilitate the high resolution
imaging of tumor margins during surgical resection.3,5,7,8

Given
their exquisite selectivity and affinity for their molecular targets,
antibodies have emerged as particularly exciting platforms for the
development of hybrid PET/OI agents. In the past few years, preclinical
investigations employing PET/OI immunoconjugates targeting HER2, CD20,
VEGF, and CD105 have emerged in the literature.9−15 Yet, despite their promise, one critical obstacle to the development
of PET/OI immunoconjugates is the lack of site-specificity in the
bioconjugation of radionuclides and fluorophores. At present, the
vast majority of bioconjugation techniques rely on reactions between
bifunctional probes and amino acids, most often lysines.12 Antibodies possess varying numbers of lysine
residues, and thus controlling the precise molecular location of conjugation
reactions is impossible. This lack of site-specificity can impair
immunoreactivity if the conjugation reaction inadvertently occurs
in or around the antigen binding domain. Furthermore, random bioconjugation
strategies yield inadequately chemically defined constructs and can
complicate the reliable reproduction of results from one antibody
to the next. Not surprisingly, the potential complications of random
bioconjugation are magnified in dual-labeled PET/OI constructs, as
two types of reporter moieties are being appended to the antibody
in two separate conjugation reactions.

In order to circumvent
these issues, considerable effort has been dedicated to the development
of strategies for the site-specific conjugation of payloads to antibodies.16−24 While promising, many of these methodologies are limited by their
use of expensive and complex work flows and/or result in poor reproducibility
of labeling between different antibodies. For example, one emergent
group of strategies for the site-specific modification of antibodies—and
the creation of antibody–drug conjugates in particular—has
relied on the reaction between bifunctional, maleimide-bearing constructs
and free cysteines in antibodies.19,25,26 These methodologies have largely proven successful.
However, this sulfhydryl-based chemistry requires either the reduction
of existing, natural disulfide bonds within the antibody or the introduction
of free cysteine resides via genetic engineering, processes which
require significant optimization and limit the general applicability
of these strategies.

As a more universal alternative, we have
developed a chemoenzymatic method for the site-specific radiolabeling
of antibodies.27 This methodology leverages
a promiscuous galactosyltransferase, an azide-modified substrate,
and strain-promoted click chemistry to specifically modify the heavy
chain glycans, the conserved, N-linked bianntennary
oligosaccharide chains positioned on the CH2 domain of the Fc region,
far from the antigen binding regions.28 The foundations of the approach lie in the glycoengineering work
of Qasba, Hsieh-Wilson, and others, as well as the strain-promoted
click chemistry work of Bertozzi and Boons.29−35 Admittedly, bioconjugation approaches based on the chemical manipulation
of the heavy chain glycans predate our strategy.36,37 However, these earlier methods often require the prolonged exposure
of the antibody to harsh redox conditions and have inherently high
variability of labeling between different antibodies. It is also important
to note that a number of descriptions of glycan-based bioconjugation
strategies have appeared in the literature since our initial report;
however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these have been applied
to the development of multimodal probes.20−22,24

Here, we report the development of site-specifically
labeled immunoconjugates for the multimodal PET/OI imaging of colorectal
cancer. The bioconjugation strategy has four steps: (1) the enzymatic
removal of the terminal galactose residues on the heavy chain glycans
with β-1,4-galactosidase; (2) the enzymatic incorporation of
azide-bearing galactose (GalNAz) residues into the glycans using a
substrate-permissive galactosyltransferase, Gal-T(Y289L); (3) the
strain-promoted click conjugation of chelator- and fluorophore-modified
dibenzocyclooctynes (DIBO) to the azide-modified sugars; and (4) the
radiolabeling of the immunoconjugate (Figure 1). For proof-of-concept, a model system was created using the colorectal
cancer-targeting antibody huA33, the positron-emitting radiometal 89Zr, and the near-infrared fluorophore Alexa Fluor 680 (Dye680).
The bioconjugation strategy proved robust, creating huA33 immunoconjugates
with an easily tunable ratio of reporter moieties. Further, the methodology
yielded a site-specifically labeled, hybrid PET/OI probe—89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680—with high immunoreactivity in vitro and high efficacy in vivo in a
murine model of colorectal cancer. Ultimately, one of the greatest
strengths of this strategy is its modularity, as the enzymatic tagging
of the glycans with GalNAz can be performed with any IgG antibody,
and dibenzocyclooctynes can be conjugated easily to a wide variety
of reporter molecules.

Fluor 680 is represented as Dye680 in the figure.

Results and Discussion
Design of the model system was the
first step of the investigation. The huA33 antibody targets the A33
antigen, a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on &gt;95% of all
colorectcal cancers, and has shown considerable promise in the clinic
as a platform for radioimmunoconjugates.38 The ability to image colorectal cancer—particularly colorectal
cancer metastatic to the liver—with PET during diagnosis and
staging and with near-infrared fluorescence during surgical resection
would certainly aid clinicians in the management of the disease. The
positron-emitting radiometal 89Zr was chosen due to the
advantageous match between the radiometal’s physical half-life
(t1/2 ∼ 3.27 d) and the multiday
biological half-life of the antibody.39 The selection of 89Zr in turn mandates the choice of
its octandentate, siderophore-derived chelator desferrioxamine (DFO).40 Alexa Fluor 680 (Dye680) was chosen because
of its near-infrared, tissue-penetrating 702 nm emission.

The
site-specific modification process begins with the enzymatic manipulation
of the heavy chain glycans. The antibody was first incubated with
β-1,4-galactosidase at 37 °C for 6 h to expose the terminal
GlcNAc sugars of the glycans. Subsequently, UDP-GalNAz and the promiscuous
galactosyltrasnferase, Gal-T(Y289L), were added to the antibody solution,
and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 16 h to append the
azide-bearing galactose residues to the sugar chains. Since our initial
report, these steps have been shortened from two 16 h incubations
with an intermediate purification to a facile two enzyme, one pot
reaction.27 Next, the DFO-, Alexa Fluor
680-, and dual-labeled conjugates were synthesized. While the singly
labeled constructs were created by incubating the site-specifically
labeled huA33-N3 construct (sshuA33-N3) with DIBO–DFO or DIBO–Alexa Fluor 680 (DIBO–Dye680),
the dual labeled constructs were synthesized via incubation with 1:3,
1:1, or 3:1 mixtures of the two DIBOs. All of the immunoconjugates
were purified using size exclusion chromatography, and a cumulative
yield of 84.8 ± 8.4% was obtained over the course of the three
step procedure (n = 20). Isotopic dilution experiments
reveal that sshuA33-DFO had a degree of labeling of 3.4
± 0.2 DFO/mAb, consistent with the near-quantitative labeling
of four theoretically available terminal GlcNAc residues. In contrast,
the degree of labeling of sshuA33-Dye680 was 1.6 ±
0.1 Dye680/mAb. Admittedly, this is below the typical degree of labeling
previously observed with other chelators and dyes (∼3–3.5/mAb)
and may be a result of the size and/or hydrophobicity of the fluorophore,
though efforts to fully understand the cause are ongoing.27 For the hybrid probes, the ratio of conjugated
DFO to Dye680 could be easily controlled by altering the initial reaction
ratio of DIBO–DFO to DIBO–Dye680. For example, the degree
of labeling of Dye680 increases from 0.5 ± 0.1 to 1.0 ±
0.1 to 1.3 ± 0.1 as the proportion of DIBO–Dye680 in the
original reaction mixture is increased. Interestingly, the total degree
of labeling ([DFO + Dye680]/mAb) decreases with increasing proportion
of DIBO–Dye680 in the original reaction mixture, perhaps a
result of the same phenomenon that leads to a lower degree of fluorescence
labeling in the sshuA33-Dye680 construct.

SDS-PAGE
electrophoresis experiments were run in order to characterize and
confirm the site-specificity of the bioconjugation approach. In the
resulting gels, a distinct increase in the molecular weight of the
heavy chain of the DFO-, Dye680-, and dual-labeled sshuA33
constructs can be observed compared to unmodified huA33 and sshuA33-N3 (Figure 2). There is no
corresponding shift in the molecular weight of the light chain, strongly
suggesting site-specific labeling. In additional experiments, the
immunoconjugates were treated with PNGaseF, an amidase that specifically
cleaves between the innermost sugar of the glycans and the asparagine
residues of the antibody (see Supporting Information). Upon PNGaseF treatment, a drop in the molecular
weight of the heavy chain is apparent for all of the constructs, and,
critically, the resulting bands are all shifted to the same molecular
weight.

Ultimately, the DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 construct
bearing 1.0 ± 0.1 Dye680/mAb and 2.0 ± 0.2 DFO/mAb was chosen
for further in vitro and in vivo study. For the sake of comparison, a dual-labeled DFO-nshuA33-Dye680 construct bearing 1.0 ± 0.2 Dye680/mAb and 2.5
± 0.4 DFO/mAb was also synthesized using a traditional, non-site-specific
isothiocyanate-based coupling strategy (Figure 3A). Admittedly, the traditional bioconjugation method is more rapid
(total time = 2 h) and results in slightly higher yields (89.9 ±
4.9%); however, the cumbersome optimization required to obtain a traditionally
conjugated construct with degrees of labeling analogous to DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 undescores the robustness and reproducibility
of the chemoenzymatic approach.

(top) and 89Zr-DFO-nshuA33-Dye680 (bottom) in
mice bearing subcutaneous SW1222 xenografts. Mice were administered 89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 or 89Zr-DFO-nshuA33-Dye680 [180–200 μCi (72–80 μg)
in 200 μL 0.9% sterile saline] via lateral tail vein injection
(t = 0) and imaged 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h postinjection.
White arrows delineate the xenografts.

Both DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 and DFO-nshuA33-Dye680
(1000 μg) were subsequently labeled with 89Zr via
incubation with 89Zr (3.0–3.2 mCi) in PBS buffer
at pH 7.0–7.5 for 1 h at room temperature. After purification
via size exclusion chromatography, both probes were isolated in &gt;99%
radiochemical purity. The specific activities of the site-specific
and traditionally synthesized constructs were similar, 2.4 ±
0.2 mCi/mg and 2.6 ± 0.1 mCi/mg, respectively. Both DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 (0.95 ± 0.04) and DFO-nshuA33-Dye680
(0.93 ± 0.06) also displayed high immunoreactive fractions when
assayed using A33 antigen-expressing SW1222 colorectal cancer cells.
While a more significant increase in immunoreactivity might be expected
for the site-specific methodology, huA33 is a well-optimized and robust
antibody. We expect the immunoreactivity benefits of this approach
to be more evident on immunoglobulins that are known to lose a significant
amount of activity upon conjugation using standard conjugation chemistries.
Finally, to assay the serum stability of the constructs, both 89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 and 89Zr-DFO-nshuA33-Dye680 were incubated in human serum for 7 d at 37
°C. After 7 days, radioTLC analysis revealed both constructs
to be &gt;95% intact.

In order to investigate the in
vivo behavior of the multimodal constructs, small animal
PET and fluorescence imaging experiments were performed in a mouse
model of colorectal cancer (Figure 3B,C). To
this end, nude mice bearing subcutaneous A33 antigen-expressing SW1222
xenografts were intravenously injected with either 89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 or 89Zr-DFO-nshuA33-Dye680
(180–200 μCi, 72–80 μg) and imaged with
both PET and fluorescence at 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h postinjection.
Both PET and fluorescence images clearly show that both immunoconjugates
accumulate significantly in the tumors. At 24 h postinjection, uptake
in the tumor is pronounced, but the constructs are also clearly visible—particularly
via PET—in the blood and heart, reducing tumor-to-background
contrast. Over the course of the experiment, however, the immunoconjugates
clear from the blood and accumulate in the xenografts such that the
tumors are prominently delineated from nontarget tissue with excellent
tumor-to-background contrast. Complementary acute biodistribution
experiments confirmed the imaging results (see Supporting Information). For 89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680, tumoral uptake values of 45.9 ± 7.9%ID/g and 45.7
± 8.1%ID/g were observed at 48 and 120 h, respectively, resulting
in tumor-to-muscle activity ratios of 30.1 ± 8.2 and 33.5 ±
15.5 at the two time-points. Critically, in the same biodistribution
experiment, a blocking experiment in which an excess of 300 μg
unlabeled DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 was co-injected with the radioimmunoconjugate
reduced tumoral uptake at 48 h from 45.7 ± 13.1%ID/g to 15.7
± 4.1%ID/g, demonstrating antigen specificity. Finally, ex vivo fluorescence microscopy and autoradiography were
performed on xenografts excised from mice injected with 89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680. The fluorescence and radioactivity
are clearly colocalized in the same regions of the tumor, the expected results for
a dual labeled imaging agent. Taken together, this investigation clearly
demonstrates that the in vitro and in vivo behavior of 89Zr-DFO-sshuA33-Dye680 is comparable
to that of the traditionally constructed agent.

Conclusion
We
have developed a methodology for the construction of site-specifically
labeled multimodal PET/OI immunoconjugates. The synthetic strategy
has proven to be robust and reliable, and we have used it to create
a hybrid 89Zr-DFO- and Alexa Fluor 680-labeled probe shown
to be as effective in vivo in a murine model of colorectal
cancer as an analogous construct synthesized using traditional non-site-specific
methods. Importantly, the ratio of chelator to fluorophore can be
easily tuned according to the needs of the experiment. If high specific
activity is a priority, the ratio of chelator-to-fluorophore can be
increased. Alternatively, if fluorescent brightness is the goal, the
relative number of fluorophores can be increased. Perhaps even more
critically, the overall strategy is completely modular, as the chemoenzymatic
GalNAz conjugation can be employed with any antibody, and myriad reporters
can be appended to dibenzocyclooctynes. Ultimately, we believe that
this methodology could have a transformational impact on the way multimodal
immunoconjugates are developed.
