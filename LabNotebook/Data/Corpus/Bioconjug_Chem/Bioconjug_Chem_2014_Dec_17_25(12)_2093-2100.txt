1 Introduction
In order to efficiently
deliver anticancer agents to tumors, biocompatible
nanoparticles or bioconjugates, including antibody–drug conjugates
(ADCs), have recently been designed, synthesized, and tested, some
even in clinical trials.1−4 Macromolecular bioconjugates and nanosized agents
have a number of intrinsic advantages over conventional low-molecular-weight
agents including a large payload capacity for anticancer agents, the
ability to protect the payload from degradation, multivalent targeting
moieties, and controlled or sustained release that minimizes side
effects while increasing the safety margin of the anticancer agents.5−7 Controlled delivery can be enhanced by changing specific design
characteristics of the bioconjugate such as its size, the nature of
the payload, and the surface features.8,9 The delivery
of macromolecular drugs to cancers largely relies on the leaky nature
of the tumor vasculature compared with healthy vessels in normal organs.10 When administered intravenously, macromolecular
bioconjugates and nanosized agents tend to circulate for prolonged
times, unless they are small enough to be excreted by the kidney or
stealthy enough to evade the macrophage phagocytic system (MPS), formerly
the reticulo-endothelial system (RES).11 Therefore, macromolecular bioconjugates and nanosized agents with
long circulation times leak preferentially into tumor tissue through
permeable tumor vessels and are then retained in the tumor bed due
to reduced lymphatic drainage. This process is known as the enhanced
permeability and retention (EPR) effect.12 Most macromolecular bioconjugates and nanosized agents tend to accumulate
within tumors, due to the EPR effect depending on the vascular characteristics
in each tumor, and then release their therapeutic payloads. However,
EPR effects provide relatively modest specificity and offer only a
20–30% increase in delivery compared with critical normal organs.
Nonetheless, macromolecular bioconjugates and nanosized cancer agents
have shown efficacy in animal models of cancer, and several agents
are undergoing testing in clinical trials.13,14 Clearly, if the EPR effect could be enhanced, potentially great
gains could be made in the delivery of macromolecular bioconjugates
and nanosized cancer agents, thereby enhancing their anticancer effects.

In this Review, we examine the basis of macromolecular or nanosized
bioconjugate delivery into cancer tissue and discuss current diagnostic
methods for evaluating leakiness of the tumor vasculature. Then, we
discuss methods to augment conventional “permeability and retention”
effects for macromolecular or nanosized bioconjugates in cancer tissue.

2 Pharmacokinetics: Small vs Large Molecules
After entry
into the systemic circulation, agents are carried via
the circulatory system and are distributed into organs. Small molecular
weight agents readily leak from the vasculature and distribute within
the tissue according to a concentration gradient. For this reason,
most small molecular antitumor agents have a large volume of distribution
after intravenous administration. While this ensures delivery to the
tumor it also exposes normal tissue to toxicity. In addition, rapid
clearance from the circulation of such agents can result in challenges
in maintaining the drug concentration within the tumor. In contrast,
the leakage of macromolecular drugs from vessels is much slower due
to their large size in relation to the gaps or fenestrations in normal
capillaries. Macromolecular agents have prolonged circulation times,
typically measured in hours to days, which provide a larger input
function to the tumor. Meanwhile, in combination with leaky tumor
vessels, macromolecular agents accumulate within the extravascular
space of tumors. This tumor-specific accumulation of large molecular
agents affects the injection dose and toxicity resulting in lower
doses and reduced toxicity.

When considering the excretion of
any agent administered systemically,
the renal clearance is the critical determinant of pharmacokinetics.
The physiological function of the kidney is to filter the plasma at
the glomerular basement membrane. Some molecules that are filtered
at the glomerulus may be recovered in the proximal tubules and others
that avoid filtration at the glomerulus may be excreted into the urine
by proximal tubular epithelium, although this is rare for nanosized
agents. The kidney is highly efficient in filtering the plasma, and
therefore, glomerular filtration should be taken into account when
designing large molecular agents. The glomerular basement membrane
is formed by specialized cells and connective tissues, and its surface
is negatively charged. The glomerulus has mostly round pores that
measure approximately 6 nm in diameter.4,11,15 Therefore, the net charge of nanosized agents will
highly influence their renal excretion; positively charged or neutral
molecules will be filtered into urine more efficiently than negatively
charged ones even if they are all approximately 6 nm in diameter.16 However, strongly positively charged agents
could be trapped by the brush border within the proximal tubules.
Thus, strongly charged molecules, in general, may have difficulty
with renal excretion even if they are at or below the size threshold
of the glomerular pore. Additionally, the shape17 and flexibility (hardness or softness)18 of the agents will alter filtration; therefore, the hydrodynamic
diameter measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS) may be insufficient
to predict the degree of renal excretion. “Soft” molecules
will more easily be filtered. Another key design factor is that DLS
measurements depict the average size of nanoparticles, which may not
accurately predict glomerular filtration since nanosized agents typically
have a range of sizes from below to above the 6 nm size threshold.

3 EPR Effects for Macromolecules and Nanoparticles
Solid
tumors often possess a permeable vasculature compared with
healthy vessels in normal organs.10 From
the pathophysiological blood/fluid circulation point of view, the
endothelial surface is fenestrated with gaps between endothelial cells,
and is surrounded by discontinuous or absent basement membranes and
fewer or poorly adherent pericytes.19−21 This enables macromolecules
to reach tumor cells from the bloodstream in higher concentration
than in normal tissues. Furthermore, most solid tumors lack functional
intratumoral lymphatic vessels; thus, the clearance of leaked drugs
in the tumor extracellular fluid is reduced. Although the lymphatic
function is impaired, the tumor has increased intratumoral pressure
which leads to convective extravasation from the tumor into the surrounding
stroma, somewhat offsetting the deficiency in lymphatics. Thus, although
different nanosized agents distribute somehow differently into tumor
tissues, the EPR effect results in generally a 20–30% increase
in the accumulation of macromolecular agents compared with small molecular
weight agents.12 The liver and MPS recognize
and remove foreign bodies from the blood pool including large molecular
agents. Therefore, such agents should be designed to evade rapid uptake
by the liver or MPS. Hydrophobic smaller nanosized agents frequently
bind serum proteins that sometimes accelerate uptake and catabolism
of the agent by the liver resulted in short circulation half-life.22 Larger molecules or particles are readily recognized
by the MPS. Molecules or particles with highly charged surfaces are
also recognized by the MPS and are quickly removed from the circulation
(Figure 1). Therefore, useful design parameters
for a large molecular agent include limiting the size (probably to
&lt;300 nm in diameter) and maintaining a net charge as close to neutral
as possible while providing a predominantly hydrophilic surface.23 To achieve this design, hydrophilic and neutral
polymers including polyethylene glycol and polysaccharides are commonly
used on the surface of nanosized agents to make them “stealthy”,
thereby avoiding recognition by the liver and MPS.24−26

long circulation of bioconjugates.

4 Drug Delivery to Tumor: Is There a Value to
Knowing the Vascular Kinetics?
The slow clearance of anticancer
bioconjugates results in a favorable
input function to the tumor. The leakiness of the tumor vessels further
contributes to drug delivery. Information regarding the permeability
and perfusion of tumors can be obtained with a variety of imaging
methods that measure the kinetics of contrast media enhancement, including
dynamic imaging using MRI, CT, and ultrasound.

Dynamic contrast
enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a functional MRI technique
that provides insight into tumor vascular kinetics. DCE-MRI relies
on the acquisition of gradient recalled echo (GRE) MRI sequences which
are obtained before, during, and after a bolus of intravenous administration,
typically a Gadolinium (Gd)-chelate contrast material. These are mainly
low molecular weight contrast media [e.g., Gd-DTPA, molecular weight
= 567 Da], although newer agents such as gadofosveset dimeglumine
can bind albumin and behave as a large agent. During DCE-MRI, tumors
are characterized by their rapid, intense enhancement followed by
a relatively rapid washout compared to normal background tissue.27

DCE-MRI can be evaluated using one or
more of three different approaches:

Qualitative
analysis
This is the easiest and the most
popular approach. This involves the visual detection of focal early,
strong enhancement with early washout—compared with that of
normal tissue.

Semiquantitative Analysis
This involves evaluation
of the shape of the signal intensity (SI) vs time curve, its onset
time, gradient of the upslope of enhancement, peak SI, and the washout
rate. Semiquantitative methods have the advantage of being simple
to perform and enable the straightforward calculation of SI changes.
However, this method depends on a linear relationship between SI and
concentration of the Gd chelate, an assumption that is usually not
correct. In order to avoid these issues SI should be converted into
Gd concentration by applying a T1 map to the precontrast images and
calculating Gd concentration.

Quantitative
Analysis
This depends on curves depicting
Gd concentration varying over time and uses multicompartment pharmacokinetic
models to calculate permeability constants. The dynamic data obtained
via DCE-MRI is used to generate curves which are mathematically fit
to two or more compartment pharmacokinetic models. This approach enables
the calculation of quantitative parameters such as Ktrans (forward flow rate constant [wash in]), kep (reverse flow rate constant [wash out]),
fpV (plasma volume fraction compared to whole tissue volume), and Ve (extravascular, extracellular volume fraction
of the tumor), using the modified Toft’s model (Figure 2).28 The kinetic parameters
are usually higher in tumors than in surrounding healthy background
tissue and these values can decrease after oncologic treatments such
as chemotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy, radiotherapy, and embolotherapy
for various cancer types.

Figure 2 Images of a patient with high serum PSA (17.8
ng/mL) are shown.
Axial T2W MRI (A) and ADC maps of diffusion weighted MRI (B) show
a midline to the left anterior transition zone lesion in the mid prostate
level (arrows). Ktrans (C) and kep (D) maps generated from the DCE MRI data
using a two-compartment model quantitative technique show an area
of leaky vasculature that highly suggests cancer (arrows). Targeted
biopsy revealed that highly malignant prostate cancer grew within
the suggested lesion.

Thus, DCE-MRI is a potential biomarker for clinical oncology
applications;
however, it has several limitations. There is currently no standardization
and consensus on which imaging protocol and analysis method should
be used. Its intra- and interpatient repeatability and reproducibility
are variable. Finally, DCE-MRI may not be feasible for some patient
groups, especially for individuals with renal failure (due to the
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis after Gd-chelate administration),
those with implanted MRI incompatible metallic devices, and those
with severe claustrophobia.29

5 How to Improve Cancer Drug Delivery
Macromolecular
agents generally tend to accumulate within tumors
at higher concentrations than small molecular agent due to the EPR
effect. However, as mentioned, EPR effects provide relatively modest
increases of approximately 20–30% in delivery compared with
normal organs.

The extent of the EPR effect is dependent on
several factors.30,31 By manipulating either local
tumor stroma or systemic conditions,
EPR effects can be altered leading to superior macromolecular drug
delivery. The three most important modifiable parameters that improve
nanosized agent delivery include (1) altering normal physiology without
modifying the tumor environment; (2) altering the tumor vasculature
or stroma; (3) killing the cancer cells to reduce their barrier function
(Figure 3).32

Figure 3 Strategies
for further improving cancer delivery of macromolecular
and nanosized bioconjugates over conventional EPR effects.

In this section, we will discuss nonselective and
selective molecular
targeting methods for further improving the “permeability and
retention” effect for large molecular agents in cancer tissue
based on modification of these three conditions.

5.1 Physiologic
Conditions
In order to
improve drug delivery within cancers while avoiding normal tissue,
one can increase the input function of the agent. Normal vessels retain
their ability to respond to extrinsic vasoconstrictors whereas tumor
vessels lose their responsiveness to such agents. In normal vessels,
muscular fibers in the vessel wall will contract, limiting blood flow.
Therefore, when vasoconstrictive drugs are administered, normal vessels
are constricted and blood pressure is increased. In contrast, tumor
vessels do not respond to vasoconstrictors because of insufficient
muscular structure. This leads to a relative increase in the input
function in vessels supplying tumors.33 This phenomenon was recognized in the 1970s during diagnostic angiography
for tumor localization and was termed “pharmaco-angiography”.34 During diagnostic angiography, vaso-constricting
agents including alpha receptor agonists were injected via a catheter
to constrict normal vessels while accentuating tumor vessels.35,36 Later, pharmaco-angiography was used to constrict vessels after
the delivery of nanodrug therapy to reduce washout and increase exposure
of the tumor to the therapy.37 Diagnostic
pharmaco-angiography is no longer needed for conventional diagnostic
scanning because CT and MRI have become so proficient at detecting
cancers, but the effect can still be put to use to selectively increase
drug delivery.

5.2 Tumor Vasculature or Stroma
Another
approach for improving nanodrug delivery to cancers is to physiologically
modify the tumor vasculature. Several anti-angiogenic drugs have been
approved and are in common use. Among them, the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab, is used for blocking the effect
of VEGF, thus inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, decreasing vascular permeability,
and suppressing tumor growth.38 On the
other hand, the administration of VEGF itself may temporally increase
leakiness and perfusion in tumor tissue and thus is a potential way
to physiologically augment the EPR effect.39 It has also been argued that anti-angiogenic treatment initially
results in vascular normalization which temporarily improves the distribution
of blood in the center of the tumor by reducing interstitial pressure
and, thus, improves delivery of drugs, although this phenomenon is
generally believed to be short-lived.40

In recent work, the endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature
have been targeted using the αvβ3 integrin which is highly
expressed in growing neovessels. The RGD-peptide sequence has high
affinity for αvβ3 integrin. To prolong its clearance,
the RGD peptide can be conjugated to a gold nanoparticle. When light
is applied, the gold nanoparticle induces photothermal damage leading
to enhanced EPR effects and cell death.41 Similar effects have been seen with targeted ultrasound microbubbles.42 While it might be tempting to damage endothelial
cells in an attempt to increase permeability, this can only be achieved
at the risk of decreasing or even eliminating blood flow to the tumor
due to thrombosis. Paradoxically, this could further reduce the amount
of circulating drug available to the tumor.

There are several
other approaches to targeting the vasculature
or stroma to promote more vascular supply and vascular permeability
in tumors. These approaches include hyperthermia43,44 radiotherapy,45 high intensity focused
ultrasound,46 and various mediators including
bradykinin,47−50 nitric oxide-releasing agent,51,52 angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors,47−50 tumor necrosis factor α,51,53 heme oxygenase-1,48,54 and proteases including collagenase55 or hyaluronidase.56 Cancer cells under
hypoxic condition intrinsically produce some of these humeral factors.
Most of these mediators are low molecular weight compounds and thus,
when additionally injected into systemic circulation, will affect
normal blood vessels in the vicinity of tumor, thus facilitating extravasation
not only within tumors but around them as well. A theoretical concern
is that compromising the integrity of cancer stroma may promote metastasis;
however, this has not been extensively investigated.32

As an alternative method to manipulating vascular
endotheral cell
function by physical or chemical or biological stimulation, the use
of active transport across the endotherial cells via caveoli or ICAM-1
has been investigated.57−59 However, although active transport into cancer tissue
has been investigated for more than a decade by a few groups and these
methods might be promising, active transport technology has not been
widely applied or accepted for designing superior bioconjugate agents
or nanosized particles for cancer treatment.

5.3 Killing
Tumor Cells
Nanodrug delivery
reportedly increases after many cancer therapies. The likely explanation
for this is that tumor cells themselves act as a barrier to deeper
penetration of nanodrugs. The heterogeneity of the blood supply within
the tumor microenvironment leads to marked heterogeneity in the rate
of cell proliferation; cancer cells near the vessels proliferate rapidly,
while cancer cells further away from the vessels suffer nutrient deprivation
and proliferate more slowly.60,61 Microscopy reveals
that tumor cells grow as sleeves or sheaths concentric with tumor
vessels.62 Such highly cellular layers
may interfere with drug penetration.63

For instance, a single application of X-ray therapy damages cancer
cells but leaves the vasculature intact. Thus, an increase in the
delivery of nanosized molecules up to 2.2-fold at a peak of 8–12
h after radiation has been observed.64 In
this case the radiation killed well oxygenated cancer cells near tumor
vessels, therefore temporarily increasing vascular permeability by
reducing the barrier function of the cancer cells. The greatest cell
damage occurred in perivascualar cancer cells which subsequently underwent
apoptosis. Interestingly, excessive radiation damaged the vessels
sufficiently to shut down blood flow which negatively affected nanodrug
delivery. Similar vascular shutdown was reported during photodynamic
therapy (PDT).65 Since PDT damages both
cancer cells and normal cells, PDT often reduces tumor blood flow.66 Similar effects were observed with some chemotherapy
including paclitaxel or docetaxel,67 which
preferably killed tumor cells close to blood vessels.

Photothermal
damage is another method of selectively increasing
EPR effects. By using a GRP78-targeting peptide conjugated to a PEGylated
gold nanorod, photothermal damage could be induced after the application
of light.68 Furthermore, systemic radioimmunoconjugates
preferably killed perivascular tumor cells resulting in improved drug
delivery.69,70 However, these methods could also damage
tumor vasculatures resulting in thrombotic occlusion from the bystander
effect. More recently, another more selective method of killing tumor
cells to augment drug delivery, named photoimmunotherapy (PIT), has
been described.71 PIT can specifically
kill cancer cells exposed to near-infrared light by inducing immediate
necrosis without damaging normal cells, including vascular endothelial
cells. Since most of the initial cell killing occurs in the perivascular
tumor sheaths, increases in nanodrug delivery of up to 24-fold compared
with untreated control tumors can be observed (Figure 4).72 This increased permeability
was induced immediately after exposure to near-infrared light. In
order to analyze tumor vascular permeability and delivery of nanosized
agents, static and dynamic fluorescence imaging with fluorescent proteins
and nanoparticles was commonly used.73−75 Dynamic fluorescence
imaging showed that intravenously injected, nontargeted polyethylene
glycol coated quantum dots (PEG-QD) quickly accumulated in the PIT-treated
tumor bed compared with nontreated controls. Histology after PIT showed
a markedly dilated tumor vasculature in the widened tumor interstitium
along with cancer cell debris. Additionally, intravenously injected
PEG-QD leaked throughout the cancer tissue following PIT. Thus, PIT
induces an immediate necrosis especially in the layers of cancer cells
surrounding the tumor vasculature without damaging vascular cells
themselves. This initially leads to decreased interstitial pressure
and a commensurate rise in perfusion and leakage into the tumor bed.
Therefore, PIT induces selective damage to perivascular cancer tissues
markedly augmenting the EPR effect and dramatically increasing drug
delivery. This super-enhanced EPR has also been referred to as SUPR
to distinguish it from conventional EPR.

Figure 4 Photoimmunotherapy induced
super-enhanced permeability and retention
(SUPR) effects delivered PEGylated quantum dots (800 nm emission;
50 nm in diameter) into PIT-treated tumor 24-fold higher concentration
than in nontreated tumor with conventional EFR effects at 1 h after
injection. (A: white light image, B: 800 nm fluorescence image.)

6 Conclusion
Macromolecular bioconjugates and nanosized cancer agents are promising
for improving cancer chemotherapy because they can achieve target-specific
or controlled delivery of large payloads of anticancer agents, resulting
in improved tumor delivery based on the unmodified EPR effect. There
are several clinically available diagnostic imaging methods to evaluate
leakiness of tumor vasculature. Furthermore, a few methods to further
improve nanodrug delivery by augmenting the conventional EPR effects
have been discovered. Among them, super-enhanced EPR effects which
occur after PIT induce damage in the layers of cancer cells immediately
adjacent to the tumor vasculature, and this can have dramatic effects
on perfusion with improvements in the delivery of nanoparticles of
up to 24-fold compared with untreated tumors. The magnitude of the
nanodelivery improvement could have a direct impact on the therapeutic
effects of nanosized cancer drugs possibly resulting in dose reductions
when used sequentially after PIT.
