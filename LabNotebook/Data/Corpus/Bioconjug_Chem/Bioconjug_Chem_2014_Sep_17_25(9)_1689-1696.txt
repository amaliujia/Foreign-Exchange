Introduction
Polymeric micelles are an attractive delivery
system due to easy
preparation, small size (10–100 nm), and the ability to solubilize
hydrophobic drugs and accumulate preferentially within tumors.− We previously developed a nanocarrier based on polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-derivatized farnesylthiosalicylate (FTS). PEG5k-FTS2 readily formed micelles
(20–30 nm) that were highly efficient in loading hydrophobic
anticancer drugs such as paclitaxel (PTX). More importantly, PTX-loaded PEG5k-FTS2 micelles
achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy compared to Taxol formulation in vivo. Different from most
of the existing drug carriers that lack therapeutic effect, PEG5k-FTS2 itself exhibits antitumor activity. FTS is a potent and especially nontoxic Ras antagonist., Ras gene mutations can be found in one-third of human cancers, with
the highest incidence in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (90%), colon
(50%), and lung (30%) tumors. FTS can
effectively inhibit the growth of many different types of tumors via
inhibition of Ras-dependent signaling involved in tumor maintenance
and progression. The mechanism involves
the dislodgement of Ras from the cell membrane and subsequent degradation
of the protein.,

As a dual function carrier,
the cleavability of the linkage between
PEG and FTS in PEG5k-FTS2 conjugate is critical
for its biological activity. In our previous study, we compared the
antitumor activity of a conjugate with a labile ester linkage, PEG5K-FTS2(L), with that of a similar conjugate with
a relatively stable amide linkage, PEG5K-FTS2(S). PEG5K-FTS2(L) alone showed a significantly higher level of cytotoxicity toward
tumor cells compared to PEG5K-FTS2(S), presumably
due to a more ready release of FTS from PEG5K-FTS2(L) inside tumor cells. In addition,
delivery of PTX via PEG5K-FTS2(L) micelles led
to an improved antitumor activity in vivo over PTX
formulated in PEG5K-FTS2(S) micelles.

In this study, we propose to incorporate
into PEG5K-FTS2(L) an additional cleavable linkage
(disulfide bond) to further
facilitate the release of FTS following intracellular delivery to
tumor cells. We choose the disulfide linkage because tumor cells have
significantly higher concentrations of glutathione (GSH) than those
in the extracellular fluids and the disulfide linkage has been widely
used to develop a reduction-sensitive delivery system to facilitate
drug release at the tumor site.− Our data showed that incorporation into PEG5K-FTS2(L) of a disulfide linkage led to an enhanced release of FTS
inside tumor cells, which was associated with an improved cytotoxicity
against tumor cells. Interestingly, the conjugate with a disulfide
linkage (PEG5k-S-S-FTS2) exhibited a reduced
critical micelle concentration (CMC) in addition to improved drug
loading capacity and formulation stability. Finally, paclitaxel (PTX)
formulated in PEG5k-S-S-FTS2 micelles was significantly
more effective than the PEG5K-FTS2(L) formulation
in inhibiting the tumor growth in a murine breast cancer model (4T1.2).

Results
Synthesis
of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 Conjugate
To facilitate
the retention of the antitumor activity of FTS, a
cleavable disulfide linkage was used to couple FTS to a hydrophilic
PEG (PEG5K-S-S-FTS2). The chemical structure
of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 is shown in Figure . As shown in 1H NMR spectra (), the signals
at 3.63 ppm and 7–8 ppm were attributed to the methylene protons
located at the terminus of PEG and the benzene ring protons of FTS,
respectively. Additionally, the chemical shift of -CH2-S-S-CH2- (2.9–3.1
ppm) could be observed, which confirmed the presence of a disulfide
linkage (). The molecular weight of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 was
determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (), which is close to the theoretical value
of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2. Both 1H NMR and
MALDI-TOF mass spectra indicated the successful synthesis of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate.

Characterization of PTX-Free and PTX-Loaded PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 Micelles
PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 was
soluble in aqueous solution and readily self-assembled
to form micelles with size around 30 nm (Figure A). Figure C shows the TEM images of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles. Spherical particles of uniform
size were observed and the sizes of the particles observed under TEM
were consistent with those measured by DLS. Figure  shows the CMCs of PEG5K-FTS2 and PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles using pyrene as a fluorescence
probe. It is interesting to note that incorporation into PEG5K-FTS2 of a disulfide linkage led to a ∼4-fold decrease
in CMC. PTX can be readily loaded into PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles. The spherical shape and size of the micelles were
well retained following incorporation of PTX (Figure B,D). We then evaluated the loading capacity and stability
of PTX-loaded PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles and compared
to those of PEG5K-FTS2 formulation. As shown
in Table , PTX could be loaded in PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles at a carrier/drug molar ratio
as low as 1/1. In contrast, a minimal carrier/drug molar ratio of
2.5/1 was needed to formulate PTX in PEG5K-FTS2 micelles. Increasing the carrier/drug molar ratio was associated
with an improvement in both drug loading efficiency (DLE) and the
colloidal stability of PTX-loaded micelles (Table ). In addition, PTX-loaded PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles showed better colloidal stability than PEG5K-FTS2 formulation at all carrier/drug ratios examined
(Table ).

In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Drug-Free Micelles
The antitumor activities
of two PTX-free micelles, PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 and
PEG5K-FTS2, were tested
in HCT-116 and DU-145 cancer cell lines and compared to free FTS (Figure ). PEG5K-FTS2 conjugate with
an ester linkage was used as a reduction-insensitive control. As shown
in Figure A, free FTS inhibited the HCT-116
cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner. PEG5K-FTS2 with a reduction-insensitive ester linkage was less active
than free FTS in cytotoxicity (Figure A).
Interestingly, incorporation into PEG5K-FTS2 of an additional disulfide linkage led to a significant improvement
in cytotoxicity compared to both free FTS and PEG5K-FTS2 (Figure A). A similar result was
observed in DU-145 cell line (Figure B).

was determined by MTT assay.

Release of FTS from the PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 and
PEG5K-FTS2 Conjugates
To investigate
whether the improved cytotoxicity of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 over PEG5K-FTS2 is attributed to a
more effective release of FTS, HPLC-MS was employed to analyze FTS
release inside PC-3 or DU-145 human prostate cancer cells 72 h following
treatment with PEG5K-FTS2 or PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles. We focused on the detection of the
signal of parent FTS. The FTS extraction protocol had minimal impact
on the integrity of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 as demonstrated
in a preliminary study (data not shown). Figure A shows that incorporation into PEG5K-FTS2 a
disulfide linkage led to a 2- to 3-fold increase in the amounts of
free FTS detected in PC-3 cells (Figure A).
A similar result was observed in DU-145 cell line (Figure B). We also conducted a preliminary study on the
release of FTS in tumor tissues in vivo. Female BALB/c
mice bearing 4T1.2 tumor (∼1 cm) received i.v. injection of
PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 and PEG5K-FTS2 micelles at the same dose and the amounts of free FTS in
the tumor tissues were examined 24 h later. As shown in Figure , a strong signal of FTS was detected in the tumor
tissues while very little FTS signal was found in the blood. It is
also apparent that significantly greater amounts of free FTS were
found in the tumors treated with PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 compared to the PEG5K-FTS2-treated tumors
(Figure ), indicating that FTS is more readily
cleaved from PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles at the
tumor sites.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Drug-Loaded Micelles
Figure  shows the in vitro cytotoxicity of PTX formulated in PEG5K-FTS2 or PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles, in comparison
with Taxol formulation in MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells. Taxol inhibited
the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a concentration
dependent manner (Figure A). Delivery of PTX
via PEG5K-FTS2 micelles led to a slight increase
in cytotoxicity against MCF-7 tumor cells. More importantly, PTX formulated
in PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles were more active
than both Taxol formulation and PTX-loaded PEG5K-FTS2 micelles in inhibiting the tumor cell growth, particularly
at low PTX concentrations (Figure A). A similar
result was observed in a colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116 (Figure B).

cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay.

In Vivo Therapeutic Study
Figure  shows the in vivo therapeutic
activity of PTX formulated in PEG5K-S-S-FTS in an aggressive
murine breast cancer model (4T1.2). PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles alone showed no effects in inhibiting the tumor growth
at the concentration used. This is due to a relatively low concentration
of FTS in this group. Taxol formulation showed a modest tumor growth
inhibition at a dose of 10 mg PTX/kg (Figure A). In contrast, both PTX-loaded PEG5K-FTS2 and PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles were more effective
than Taxol formulation at the same dose (Figure A). More importantly, PTX formulated in PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles exhibited even more potent tumor growth inhibition
than PTX-loaded PEG5K-FTS2 micelles (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure A). No significant
changes in body weight were detected in all treatment groups compared
to PBS control group (Figure B).

Discussion
We
have previously reported that PTX-loaded PEG5K-FTS2(L) micelles showed better antitumor activity than Taxol formulation,
which could be ascribed to their preferential tumor accumulation and
a possible synergistic effect between PEG5K-FTS2(L) carrier and loaded PTX. In this study,
we have shown that inclusion of a disulfide linkage led to a further
improvement in the therapeutic activity compared to PTX formulated
in PEG5k-FTS2(L) micelles and Taxol in vivo (Figure ).

Similar
to PEG5K-FTS2(L), PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 readily self-assembled to form micelles in aqueous
solution with relatively small size (∼30 nm) (Table ). Such small size shall enable the carrier to be
highly effective in passive accumulation at and deep penetration into
solid tumors, including the poorly vascularized tumors., Interestingly, inclusion of a disulfide linkage led to an improvement
in both PTX loading capacity and the colloidal stability of PTX-loaded
micelles (Table ). We further noticed that
incorporation into PEG5K-FTS2(L) a disulfide
linkage resulted in a 4-fold decrease in CMC (Figure ). A lower CMC will enable the micelles to be more stable
in the blood circulation following systemic administration. This is likely due to an improved cooperation
in both carrier/carrier and carrier/drug interactions following incorporation
of a flexible disulfide linkage into the lipid motif of the carrier.
The increase in the chain length of lipid motif following inclusion
of a disulfide linkage may also contribute to the improved PTX loading
capacity and formulation stability.

HPLC-MS analysis showed
that parent FTS can be detected from cultured
cancer cells following treatment with PEG5K-FTS2(L) micelles (Figure ), suggesting that FTS
can be released from the conjugate via intracellular esterases. It
is also apparent that significantly higher levels of parent FTS were
found in tumor cells treated with PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate (Figure ). A similar result was
found in tumor tissues (Figure ) in tumor-bearing
mice receiving i.v. administration of PEG5K-FTS2(L) or PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate. FTS can be
released from the PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate via
two different mechanisms: one is direct cleavage of the ester linkage
adjacent to FTS to generate the parent FTS, and the other involves
reduction of the disulfide linkage first, followed by cleavage of
the ester linkage to generate the parent FTS (Figure ). The fact that significantly greater amounts of parent FTS
were released from cells treated with PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 would suggest that the latter is the major mechanism for
FTS release (Figure ). This is probably because
direct release of FTS from PEG5K-FTS2(L) by
intracellular esterases is relatively ineffective due to the steric
hindrance imposed by PEG. On the other hand, cleavage of disulfide
linkage is a more effective process inside tumor cells due to the
significantly increased GSH levels in tumor cells., Once released from the conjugate, the small molecule intermediate
can be effectively hydrolyzed by the intracellular esterases to generate
the parent FTS (Figure ).

Proposed mechanism for
the release of FTS from PEG5K-FTS2 and PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugates
following intracellular delivery to tumor cells.

In vitro cytotoxicity showed that PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate was significantly more effective
in
inhibiting the proliferation of cultured tumor cells compared to PEG5K-FTS2(L) conjugate (Figure ). The increased cytotoxicity of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 is most likely due to a facilitated release of FTS following inclusion
of an additional cleavable disulfide linkage. It is interesting to
note that PEG5K-SS-FTS2 also exhibited higher
levels of cytotoxicity than free FTS at low concentrations (Figure ). This is unlikely due to the surfactant activity
of the conjugate as PEG5K-SS-FTS2 showed minimal
hemolytic activity at even much higher concentrations (data not shown).
It is possible that PEG5K-SS-FTS2 is more effectively
taken by tumor cells than free FTS, which will be further examined
in the future. PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 not only retained
the biological activity well, but also served as an efficient carrier
to deliver hydrophobic drug PTX. PTX formulated in PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles showed a level of cytotoxicity that
was higher than that of either Taxol or PTX formulated in PEG5K-FTS2(L) micelles (Figure ), particularly at low PTX concentrations.

In vivo antitumor study showed that PTX formulated
in PEG5K-FTS2(L) micelles were significantly
more effective than Taxol formulation in a syngeneic murine breast
cancer model (Figure ), which is consistent
with our previous report. It is also apparent
that inclusion of a disulfide linkage in PEG5K-FTS2(L) micellar system led to a further improvement in antitumor
activity (Figure ). The improved performance
is likely attributed to a more effective cleavage of FTS from the
conjugate in the tumor tissue, which shall lead to not only enhanced
intracellular delivery of FTS but also facilitated release of loaded
drug following disassembly of micelles. It remains to be investigated
whether the improved carrier/drug interaction and the reduced CMC
of the PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micellar system also contribute
to the overall improvement in antitumor activity.

Conclusion
An improved dual-functional micellar carrier composed of a PEG
shell and FTS core via a disulfide linkage (PEG5k-S-S-FTS2) was developed. PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 retained
the FTS biological activity well, which was attributed to an effective
release of FTS from the conjugate following intracellular delivery.
In addition, PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 readily self-assembled
into small-sized micelles and formed stable mixed micelles with PTX.
More importantly, PTX-loaded PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles
demonstrated more effective therapeutic effects in vivo over Taxol formulation and PTX-loaded PEG5K-FTS2 micelles.

allowed to react overnight
at room temperature. The solution was filtered and precipitated in
diethyl ether and ethanol twice, respectively. Compound 6 was obtained by further drying under vacuum.

Preparation
and Characterization of PTX-Loaded PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 Micelles
PTX-solubilized PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles were prepared via a solvent evaporation
method following our published protocol., Briefly, PTX
(10 mM in chloroform) and PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate
(10 mM in chloroform) were mixed with various carrier/drug ratios.
A film of drug/carrier mixture was formed by removed the organic solvent
and the film was further dried under vacuum. PTX-loaded micelles were
formed by adding DPBS to hydrate the thin film followed by gentle
vortexing. The PTX loading efficiency was measured by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Alliance 2695–2998 system) as
described previously. Drug loading capacity
(DLC) and drug loading efficiency (DLE) were calculated according
to the following equation:

Morphology, micelle size, and size
distribution were assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
and dynamic light scattering (DLS) following our published protocol. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles was determined using pyrene
as a fluorescence probe.

Release of
FTS from the PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 and PEG5K-FTS2 Conjugates
DU-145
and PC-3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 24 h of incubation
in DMEM with 5% FBS, the old medium was removed and the cells were
incubated for 72 h in the presence of drug-free PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 or PEG5K-FTS2 micelles. The cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS three times and solubilized via a mixture
of MeOH and H2O. The lysates were vortexed and then centrifuged
at 14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred
to another set of 1.5 mL microtubes and stored at −80 °C
for MS analysis. The amount of FTS in each sample was quantified by
Waters’ SYNAPT G2-S mass spectrometer according to the literature., Chromatographic separation of FTS was performed on an Acquity UPLC
BEH C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.7 μm, Waters). The mobile
phase A (MPA) was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, and mobile phase
B was 0.1% formic acid in water. The flow rate of mobile phase was
0.40 mL/min and the column temperature was maintained at 50 °C.
Data were processed using QuanLynx (v 4.1, Waters). Extracted ion
chromatograms (EICs) were extracted using a 20 mDa window centered
on the expected m/z 357.189 for
FTS.

Similarly, FTS release was examined with tumor tissues
from female BALB/c mice bearing 4T1.2 tumor (∼1 cm). Groups
of 4 mice received i.v. injection of PEG5K-FTS2 or PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 conjugate at a dose of 58.5
μmol/kg. One day post injection, blood and tumors were collected.
Samples were homogenized with PBS, and then mixed with 2 volumes of
acetonitrile. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min, incubated for 5
min, and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.
The supernatants were decanted from each sample into a clean centrifugation
tube for MS analysis and FTS was then analyzed as described above.

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study
The cytotoxicity
of PTX formulated in PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles
was assessed with several cancer cell lines and compared to Taxol
and PTX loaded in PEG5K-FTS2 micelles, respectively.
Briefly, MCF-7 cells (5000 cells/well) and HCT-116 cells (1000 cells/well)
were seeded in 96-well plates. After incubation in DMEM with 5% FBS
and 1% streptomycin–penicillin for 24 h, the old medium was
removed and the cells were further incubated for 3 days in the presence
of indicated concentrations of PTX formulated in Cremophor/EL, PEG5K-S-S-FTS2, or PEG5K-FTS2 micelles. Cell viability was then assessed by MTT assay following
our published literature. Similarly, the
cytotoxicity of drug-free PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles
was examined and compared to free FTS and PEG5K-FTS2 micelles as described above.

In Vivo Therapeutic Study
An aggressive
murine breast cancer model (4T1.2) was used to examine the in vivo therapeutic effect of different formulations of
PTX. Tumors were induced by inoculation of 4T1.2 cells (1 × 105) in 100 μL PBS at the right flank of female BALB/c
mice. After tumors in the mice reached a tumor volume of ∼40
mm3, treatments were started and this day was designated
as day 1. On the first day, tumor (4T1.2)-bearing mice were randomly
divided into five groups (n = 5) and administered
i.v. with PBS (control), drug-free PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles, Taxol (10 mg PTX/kg), PTX-loaded PEG5K-FTS2, and PEG5K-S-S-FTS2 micelles (10 mg
PTX/kg), respectively, on days 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Tumor sizes
were measured twice a week and tumor volumes were calculated by the
formula: (L × W2)/2, where L and W represent the
longest and shortest in tumor diameters (mm). Each group was compared
by relative tumor volume (RTV) (where RTV equals to the tumor volume
divided by the initial tumor volume before treatment). The body weights
of all mice from each group were measured twice a week.

Statistical
Analysis
Data are presented as mean ±
standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s t test for comparison of two groups, and comparisons for
multiple groups were made with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
followed by Newman-Keuls test if the overall P &lt;
0.05. In all statistical analysis, the threshold of significance was
defined as P &lt; 0.05.
