Introduction
The copper(I)-catalyzed
azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)
reaction has become the icon of click chemistry since its introduction
by the Sharpless and Meldal laboratories., Numerous
scientific disciplines (e.g., biology, chemical synthesis, materials
science, etc.) have utilized the rapid kinetics, mild conditions,
and orthogonality of CuAAC reactions for applications ranging from
bioconjugation to polymer synthesis.− Methods of introducing
the azide or alkyne moiety into polypeptides range from standard solid
and solution phase techniques to biological incorporation using engineered
codons during recombinant expression of proteins.− Due to these
benefits, the number and types of biological applications using CuAAC
have grown tremendously in recent years. In the field of radiopharmaceuticals,
CuAAC has been harnessed for labeling a variety of biomolecules (e.g.,
small molecules, peptides, antibodies, etc.) with short-lived radionuclides
during targeted nuclear imaging studies., The diagnostic
radionuclide 99mTc [t1/2 =
6.02 h, 140 keV γ (89%)] has nearly ideal nuclear properties
for single photon computed emission tomography (SPECT). The fac-[99mTcI(OH2)3(CO)3]+ core developed by Alberto has gained
recognition for SPECT applications due to its small molecular volume,
versatile chelation chemistry, straightforward preparation from an
aqueous-based kit, and amenability for readily labeling a wide variety
of biomolecules.−

CuAAC has been used to incorporate ligands for the fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ core into
biomolecules by several strategies. In
the click, then chelate strategy, a biomolecule functionalized
with an azide or an alkyne undergoes cycloaddition with a bifunctional
chelator containing the orthogonal coupling partner prior to complexation
with fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+. The click to chelate strategy developed
by Schibli and Mindt is a variant of this method where the 1,2,3-triazole
generated by the click reaction acts as an integral ligand donor for
the fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ core., In an alternative chelate,
then click strategy, a bifunctional chelator is first complexed
with 99mTc and then joined to a biomolecule via CuAAC to
generate the final radiopharmaceutical. As the click reaction can
be accomplished under physiological temperature and pH, this radiolabeling
strategy enables the pairing of sensitive biomolecules with ligands
that require harsh labeling conditions (e.g., high temperature or
pH) to drive complexation kinetics with the fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ core.

Tridentate ligands containing aromatic nitrogen donors, such as
histidine or 2,2′-dipicolylamine (DPA), have been
shown to form kinetically and thermodynamically inert fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ complexes
due to the chelate effect (tridentate as opposed to mono- or bidentate
ligands) and the low-spin d6 metal center.,,− Despite the high in vitro and
in vivo stabilities of these complexes, their formation often requires
high temperatures (&gt;90 °C) to achieve quantitative radiolabeling
yields in acceptable time frames (30–60 min). Additionally,
the lipophilic fac-[99mTcI(CO)3(DPA)]+ complexes can lead to undesirable uptake
and retention of the labeled radiopharmaceutical in nontarget tissues
such as the liver and gastrointestinal tract., In an effort to generate a versatile fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ complex with
increased hydrophilicity and high stability, we installed carboxylate
groups on the aromatic rings of an alkyne-functionalized DPA ligand.
Using CuAAC would allow the ligand or radiolabeled complex to be easily
incorporated into a wide spectrum of targeting molecules containing
an azide group. An azide-functionalized α-melanocyte stimulating
hormone (α-MSH) analogue was chosen as a model targeting biomolecule
to test this new chelate system with fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+.

Malignant melanoma
remains the deadliest form of skin cancer due
to its high metastatic rate and to challenges in detecting and treating
these metastases at early stages.− Development of targeting peptides
labeled with SPECT isotopes to identify metastatic melanoma at early
stages continues to be an active area of medical research.− The majority of these peptides are α-MSH analogues which bind
to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a biomarker that is overexpressed
on primary and metastatic melanoma cells (∼400 to 22 000
receptors/cell) compared to normal cells.,− Several α-MSH analogues labeled with fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ have shown
promising results for detecting models of melanoma in vivo during
preclinical studies.,,,− Utilizing various chelates
and attachment strategies with α-MSH peptides has been shown
to modulate the in vivo properties of the ensuing fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]-labeled peptides.
While many conjugates have demonstrated undesired uptake in the liver
and gastrointestinal tract,,, introducing carboxylates on a pyrazolyl-based ligand has recently
been shown to markedly reduce the hepatobiliary retention of α-MSH
peptide analogues after labeling with the fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ core.

We hypothesized that the addition of carboxylates
on a DPA chelate
would increase the hydrophilicity and decrease the nonspecific hepatobiliary
uptake of the resulting fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ complex compared to the original
DPA ligand while maintaining complex stability. To test this hypothesis,
we employed a previously characterized DPA-alkyne ligand, 1, and the new, carboxylate-functionalized DPA-alkyne ligand, 3, in parallel studies to incorporate the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ (M = Re/99mTc) core into an α-MSH peptide by convergent pathways (click, then chelate and chelate, then click) as shown in Scheme . The in vitro stabilities
of the complexed ligands and peptides were determined, and the melanoma
targeting potentials of the labeled peptides were evaluated through
(1) in vitro MC1R affinity, (2) in vitro B16F10 cell uptake assays,
and (3) in vivo biodistribution analyses in B16F10 xenograft models.

Results
and Discussion
In an effort to generate a versatile ligand
for the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core with enhanced hydrophilicity,
we synthesized a DPA chelate with carboxylate substitutions on the
pyridal rings and a terminal alkyne on the central amine. Reductive
amination between propargyl amine and methyl 6-formylnicotinate using
sodium triacetoxyborohydride followed by basic hydrolysis of the methyl
ester groups provided the desired ligand, 3, in moderate
overall yield (55%) following isolation and purification. Standard
characterization techniques were used to confirm the structure of
the isolated material as the desired compound. The IR spectrum contained
a band at 3244 cm–1 which suggested a terminal alkyne
group (CH stretching), although the corresponding expected absorption
in the 2000–2200 cm–1 region (C≡C
stretching) was not present. However, 1H NMR analysis indicated
the presence of a propargyl-type system due to the resonances at 3.21
and 4.06 ppm for the terminal and methylene protons, respectively.
Reaction of 3 with fac-[ReI(OH2)3(CO)3](SO3CF3) at 70 °C in mildly acidic (pH 6–6.5) aqueous
conditions produced the desired complex in moderate yield (66%) following
purification by preparatory RP-HPLC. As anticipated, 1H
NMR analysis of the isolated product, 4, showed the methylene
protons of the DPA moiety as an AB quartet (5.03/4.96 ppm) with a
downfield shift from their original appearance as a singlet in the
spectrum of 3 (4.62 ppm). ESI-MS analysis confirmed a
ligand:Re(CO)3 ratio of 1:1 in complex 4 as
expected for tridentate coordination at the DPA chelate site. IR analysis
indicated a facial arrangement of the carbonyls on the metal center
following complexation as has been observed with other fac-[ReI(CO)3(DPA)]+ complexes.,,

The absolute coordination
environment of 4 was confirmed
through single-crystal X-ray analysis (Figure ). Crystallographic details, bond lengths, and bond angles are given
in the  (Tables S5–S7).
Crystals of 4 packed in the P21/c space group with four molecules in the unit cell.
The bond lengths and angles between the carbonyl ligands and the metal
center in 4 (1.918–1.939 Å and 89.18–91.16°,
respectively) were as expected for distorted octahedral fac-[ReI(CO)3(DPA)]+ complexes., The bond lengths between rhenium and the central nitrogen (2.227
Å) or the pyridal nitrogens (2.163 and 2.176 Å) in 4 were also similar to those in complex 2 (2.223
and 2.171 Å, respectively) as previously characterized. This suggests that including the carboxylates
did not significantly perturb complexation with the fac-[ReI(CO)3]+ core. The alkyne was
pointed away from the metal center as would be necessary for participation
in CuAAC reactions with azides.

red; Re, dark blue.

Having established that 3 coordinates fac-[ReI(CO)3]+ as desired, we assessed
its labeling efficiency with fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ to determine its potential for
use in SPECT imaging applications. Radiolabeling 3 with fac-[99mTcI(OH2)3(CO)3]+ at 70 °C yielded a single peak
with a similar RP-HPLC tR (19.2 min) as
complex 4 (18.9 min), indicating successful formation
of the desired product, 4a (Figure ). After determining that complexation occurred as expected, decreasing
concentrations of 3 were used to examine the effects
of the carboxylate substitutions on the radiolabeling efficiency compared
to the original DPA-alkyne chelate, 1. Quantitative labeling
was achieved in 30 min at 70 °C when 3 was employed
at 1 × 10–4 M with decreasing yields at lower
concentrations (). While extending
the reaction time to 1 h increased yields of 4a, labeling
efficiency with 3 was lower than with 1 to
produce 2a when identical experimental conditions were
used. High decay corrected yields of 4a (&gt;91%) could be achieved following RP-HPLC purification.
A major objective in preparing the new ligand was to increase the
hydrophilicity of the resulting metal complex and to decrease hepatobiliary
retention of radiopharmaceuticals with this complex compared to the
regular DPA complex. Log P analysis (octanol/PBS
partition coefficient) of complexes 2a and 4a yielded values of −0.23 ± 0.01 and −1.85 ±
0.02, respectively, confirming that the carboxylate-functionalized
DPA complex was more hydrophilic than the regular DPA complex at physiological
pH.

Normalized and offset RP-HPLC chromatograms of 4 (UV
absorbance, 254 nm; lower blue trace) at tR 18.9 min and 4a (radiodetector, counts per minute (cpm);
higher red trace) at tR 19.2 min.

Targeted radiopharmaceuticals
should maintain high biological stability
with the radionuclide to avoid nonspecific uptake or retention of
radioactive species in nontarget tissues during in vivo applications.
Serum stability analyses and amino acid challenge assays were performed
with purified solutions of 4a to assess its resistance
to transchelation or oxidation under biologically relevant conditions
(). As expected from previous studies
employing DPA complexes with fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+,,,,4a was
&gt;98% stable in serum and in the presence of 1 mM histidine or cysteine
up to 24 h. These in vitro results suggested that the chelate would
be suitable for further exploration within a radiopharmaceutical construct
for in vivo applications.

The encouraging radiolabeling results
with the novel chelate prompted
its evaluation in a targeting peptide framework. A NAPamide α-MSH
peptide containing a nonessential cysteine residue (Cys-NAPamide)
was chosen as an initial model system to incorporate the ligand or fac-[MI(CO)3]+ complex
in a site-specific manner. NAPamide was chosen because of its high
MC1R affinity and in vivo stability as demonstrated in previous studies;,, we have recently employed a similar
peptide with fac-[MI(CO)3]+ using an alternative chelate. The thiol group of cysteine presents an attractive moiety for functionalization
due to its lower pKa compared to other
nucleophiles in biomolecules (e.g., amines, alcohols). Native cysteine
residues are absent from many targeting biomolecules (e.g., peptides,
affibodies) or are not accessible due to disulfide bridge formation
(e.g., proteins, antibodies)., Therefore, synthetic
or recombinant techniques can be employed to install a nonessential
cysteine residue into these scaffolds for selective functionalization
at locations that would not impair affinity for the biological target.
Cysteine was utilized to append an azide functional group for attaching
the alkyne-functionalized chelates to the peptide via CuAAC. The 2-bromo-N-(3-azidopropyl)-acetamide azide linker was chosen because
it is stable to hydrolysis in aqueous solution, and it has previously
been used for selective S-alkylation of proteins
to incorporate an azide functionality for subsequent CuAAC reactions.

The Cys-NAPamide peptide, 5, was prepared using solid
phase peptide synthesis with Fmoc-protected amino acids in high purity
as indicated by RP-HPLC analysis (). Following TCEP reduction of the peptide, alkylation was performed
overnight at room temperature with a slight excess of 2-bromo-N-(3-azidopropyl)-acetamide in a PBS/MeCN mixture. These
conditions ensured maximum alkylation of the starting peptide with
minimal side product (e.g., dialkylation) formation. The alkylated
peptide, 6, was isolated in moderately high yields (&gt;70%)
and high purity (&gt;99% by RP-HPLC, ) following RP-HPLC purification. ESI-MS analysis confirmed the identity
of the product as the desired monoalkylated species (1341.1 m/z, Table ). IR
analysis showed a prominent absorption at 2103 cm–1 as anticipated for the presence of an azide group. Evaluation of 6 with Ellman’s reagent confirmed that that the azide
linker had been incorporated at the cysteine residue as no free thiols
(&lt;1%) were detected during analysis.

Following incorporation of the azide linker, two pathways
were
examined to label the peptide with fac-[MI(CO)3]+: click, then chelate and chelate, then click. Both pathways have previously
been utilized with DPA ligands to form metal complexes with biologically
relevant small molecules through CuAAC reactions., The click, then chelate route is analogous to the
prevailing strategy in the literature where a targeting species is
functionalized with a bifunctional chelator prior to complexation
with the metal. The chelate, then click approach
was used as an alternative strategy to generate the metal-complexed
peptides to determine if the presence of the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core prior to the CuAAC reaction
affected formation of the desired products. CuAAC reactions were performed
to append ligands 1 or 3 to peptide 6 in order to yield constructs 7 and 8 containing the standard DPA chelate and the new DPA chelate bearing
carboxylates, respectively. Due to the likelihood of copper coordination
by the DPA chelates,, excess Cu(OAc)2 was
used in the CuAAC reactions to ensure that enough copper(I) would
be available to catalyze the desired cycloaddition reactions. After
RP-HPLC analysis indicated completion of the reactions, EDTA or sodium
sulfide was added to remove copper and the crude peptides were purified
to a single peak by RP-HPLC (Table , ). ESI-MS analysis indicated
that the peptides were produced as desired due to the resonances at
790.7 m/z and 834.7 m/z for the [M+2H]2+ ions of 7 and 8, respectively (Table ), although copper complexes of these peptides were also apparent
as minor species in the MS spectra (821.2 m/z and 866.2 m/z for [M+2H+Cu]2+ ions of 7 and 8, respectively,
Table ). This result is similar to what has
been observed previously with the DPA-alkyne ligand, 1, following CuAAC reaction with a functionalized azide. Using excess sodium sulfide to remove residual
copper from the peptides by forming CuS was only partially successful;
employing precoordinated copper complexes (e.g., tris-(benzyl-triazolylmethyl)amine)
during the CuAAC reactions also failed to yield 7 and 8 without residual copper present (data not shown). Despite
the presence of copper in the peptides, subsequent reactions of 7 and 8 with fac-[ReI(OH2)3(CO)3](SO3CF3) yielded the rhenium-complexed peptides 9 and 10, respectively, following RP-HPLC purification (). ESI-MS analysis of 9 and 10, which showed the anticipated [M+H]2+ ions at 925.7 m/z and
968.7 m/z, respectively, confirmed
coordination of the fac-[ReI(CO)3]+ core to the peptides (Table ), and no copper was evident during analysis following fac-[ReI(CO)3]+ complexation. Overall
yields of 9 and 10 from the starting azide-functionalized
peptide 6 via the click, then chelate strategy were 50% and 39%, respectively.

The chelate,
then click route was then examined
to compare overall reaction yields from 6 and to determine
if the products obtained corresponded to those via the click,
then chelate route. A particular advantage of the chelate, then click synthetic strategy is that the ligand
is complexed with the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ center prior to cycloaddition with the azide
on the peptide, assuring that the final metal-complexed product is
obtained as desired without the possibility of mixed coordination
species. Surprisingly, RP-HPLC analysis of the chelate, then
click reactions between peptide 6 and complexes 2 and 4 indicated that species with slightly
different tR’s were formed compared
to those from the click, then chelate pathway (Table ). ESI-MS analysis of these new species, designated 9′ for the analogue with the regular DPA complex and 10′ for the analogue with the carboxylate-functionalized
DPA complex, following RP-HPLC purification of the reactions confirmed
that the fac-[ReI(CO)3]+-labeled peptides were successfully obtained without residual
copper via this synthetic pathway (925.5 m/z for [M+H]2+ ions of 9′ and
1936.3 m/z for [M–H]− ions of 10′, Table ). Yields for 9′ and 10′ obtained by the chelate, then click strategy from
peptide 6 were 47% and 70%, respectively. The different tR’s of 9/9′ and 10/10′ suggest that the presence of copper prior to
rhenium complexation negatively affected the desired coordination
of the fac-[ReI(CO)3]+ core in the click, then chelate strategy. In subsequent
reactions, the peptides obtained by the chelate, then click strategy (9′ and 10′) were
hypothesized to possess the desired N,N,N coordination mode exclusively at the chelate
position because metal complexation with the DPA ligands, which possess
well-defined coordination and high stability with the fac-[ReI(CO)3]+ core,,, was performed prior to attachment
to the peptide. The rhenium-complexed peptides produced by the click, then chelate pathway (9 and 10) were likely coordination isomers of the desired products and were
not pursued in the biological assays below.

Peptides 5, 6, 9′, and 10′ were used in B16F10 melanoma cell competitive
binding assays with a standard radiolabeled MC1R binding peptide, 125I-(Tyr2)-NDP, to confirm that the modifications
made to the peptides through linker attachment and metal complexation
did not abrogate their affinity for the MC1R. These assays yielded
IC50 values in the low nanomolar range for the peptides
(Table ), although the IC50 values
were higher than that of the previously reported NAPamide sequence
when tested with B16F1 melanoma cells (0.27 nM). The high affinity of the metalated analogues supported
further exploration of the peptides with 99mTc for targeting
melanoma in SPECT applications.

Both synthetic pathways used
with the rhenium analogues were explored
for producing the 99mTc-complexed peptides. In the click, then chelate pathway, peptides 7 and 8 containing the DPA chelate and the carboxylate-functionalized
DPA chelate, respectively, were directly complexed with fac-[99mTcI(OH2)3(CO)3]+ at 70 °C for 1 h in PBS. RP-HPLC analysis
showed similar tR’s for these 99mTc-labeled peptides, designated 9a and 10a (Table , ), as was observed for the respective rhenium analogues, 9 and 10 (Table ), produced
by the click, then chelate strategy. This suggested
that similar coordination modes were obtained with both fac-[MI(CO)3]+ cores using these peptides.
Radiolabeling yields of 9a and 10a after
1 h at 70 °C were greater than 93% (conversion from fac-[99mTcI(OH2)3(CO)3]+) when the peptides were used at ∼5 ×
10–5 M with declining yields at shorter times and
lower concentrations as was observed with the ligands (1 and 3) before attachment to the peptides. Purification
of the products by RP-HPLC yielded 9a and 10a in moderate decay-corrected yields (Table ).

The chelate, then click pathway was next explored
to produce the 99mTc-complexed peptides 9a′ and 10a′. Performing the CuAAC reactions with
∼5 × 10–5 M 6 and crude
reaction mixtures of 2a or 4a at 50 °C
in PBS yielded 9a′ and 10a′ quantitatively (&gt;98% conversion from 2a or 4a) in as little as 30 min, although decay-corrected yields
of 9a′ and 10a′ were moderate
following
RP-HPLC isolation (Table ). Comparison of
the RP-HPLC tR’s of the Re and 99mTc analogues produced by the chelate, then click route validated the identities of 9a′ and 10a′ (Tables  and , Figures  and ). As was observed with the rhenium-complexed peptides,
different RP-HPLC tR’s of 9a/9a′ and 10a/10a′ were observed
for the products of the chelate, then click route
compared to the click, then chelate route (Table ).

Normalized and offset RP-HPLC chromatograms of 9′ (UV absorbance, 220 nm; lower blue trace) at tR 14.9 min and 9a′ (radiodetector, counts
per minute (cpm); higher red trace) at tR 15.1 min produced by the chelate, then click route.

Normalized and offset RP-HPLC chromatograms
of 10′ (UV absorbance, 238 nm; earlier blue trace)
at tR 15.3 min and 10a′ (radiodetector,
counts per minute (cpm); later red trace) at tR 15.5 min produced by the chelate, then click route.

The in vitro stabilities of the
radiolabeled peptides were examined
prior to testing their in vivo properties. It was likely that the
stabilities of 9a and 10a would differ from 9a′ and 10a′ due to the potentially
different fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ coordination modes resulting from the click, then chelate and chelate, then click strategies. Peptide 9a′ was &gt;99% stable in
the
presence of either histidine or cysteine at 37 °C for 4 h with
slightly lower stability (84%) in cysteine at 18 h (). Peptide 10a′ exhibited &gt;99%
stability under these conditions for 18 h (). Both 9a′ and 10a′ were &gt;90% stable for 6 h at 37 °C in serum () which indicated they would be candidates
for further
biological analysis. RP-HPLC analysis of 9a and 10a produced via the click, then chelate route,
however, showed multiple species at times beyond 2 h in the above
challenge conditions and when incubated in PBS at room temperature
following purification (data not shown). This suggests that residual
copper which was apparent in peptides 7 and 8 prior to complexation with the fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+ core led to less stable
coordination modes or may have negatively impacted the integrity of
the radiolabeled peptides (e.g., through metal-mediated peptide hydrolysis,). Employing the precomplexed ligands in the chelate, then
click strategy did not suffer these drawbacks, thus highlighting
the benefit of this synthetic pathway for generating the desired fac-[99mTcI(CO)3]+-complexed peptides, 9a′ and 10a′. Having determined which species were stable in solution, the effects
of the two chelates (regular DPA vs carboxylate-functionalized DPA)
on the overall hydrophilicity of the peptides was examined. Under
the acidic conditions (0.1% TFA) used for RP-HPLC analysis, the analogues
bearing the novel chelate (8, 10′, 10a′) had slightly longer tR’s compared to their counterparts with the unmodified
DPA chelate (7, 9′, 9a′). This observation could be explained by protonation of one of the
carboxylates on the modified DPA chelate at low pH, leading to a zwitterionic
form of the chelate in 8 and an overall neutral charge
for the metal complexes in 10′ and 10a′. The DPA ligand in 7, on the other hand, was protonated
at low pH; complexation with the metal in 9′ and 9a′ retained the positive charge from the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core regardless of pH.
Thus, the tR’s of the compounds
under the acidic RP-HPLC conditions did not adequately correlate to
the anticipated hydrophilicity of the compounds at physiological pH.
Log P analysis at neutral pH confirmed the increased
hydrophilicity of 10a′ (−2.03 ± 0.01)
compared to 9a′ (−0.68 ± 0.04) as
would be desired for generating a targeted peptide with less hepatobiliary
retention compared to the more hydrophobic analogue.

Following
the radiolabeling and characterization studies above,
the in vitro B16F10 melanoma cell uptake and MC1R specificity of 9a′ and 10a′ were explored at 0.5,
1, and 2 h (Figure ). 9a′ exhibited moderate accumulation in B16F10 melanoma cells at 37 °C,
reaching 2.71 ± 0.18%, 3.30 ± 0.44%, and 5.86 ± 1.07%
of applied activity at 0.5, 1, and 2 h, respectively. Interestingly,
increased cell uptake values were observed for 10a′, reaching 2.75 ± 0.72%, 4.01 ± 0.47%, and 9.40 ±
1.08% at 0.5, 1, and 2 h, respectively. The significantly higher uptake
of 10a′ compared to 9a′ at
2 h (P &lt; 0.05) in the melanoma cells was surprising
considering that the rhenium-complexed analogues exhibited similar
IC50 values in the MC1R binding assays (3.57 ± 1.15
nM for 9′ and 3.13 ± 0.29 for 10′). To confirm whether the binding of 9a′ and 10a′ with B16F10 cells was due to specific interactions
with MC1R, the cells were coincubated with solutions containing 9a′ or 10a′ and excess amounts
of unlabeled NDP for 0.5, 1, and 2 h at 37 °C. As shown in Figure , these blocking conditions caused a decrease in
the uptake of the radiolabeled peptides at 2 h from 5.86 ± 1.07%
to 1.42 ± 0.08% (P &lt; 0.05) for 9a′ and from 9.40 ± 1.08% to 1.20 ± 0.22% (P &lt; 0.05) for 10a′. Thus, unlabeled NDP significantly
reduced the binding of 9a′ and 10a′ to B16F10 cells, indicating that the uptake of the radiolabeled
peptides was mediated by the MC1R.

In vitro B16F10 cell uptake assay of 9a′ and 10a′. B16F10 cells were
incubated with 1 μCi
of 9a′ or 10a′ for 0.5, 1,
and 2 h at 37 °C with or without NDP (3 μM) as a blocking
agent. Data represent the amount of activity associated with the cells
as a percentage of the total activity applied ± standard deviation
and are the average of two individual experiments performed in quadruplicate. 9a′ only (black squares with solid black line), 9a′ with NDP (black circles with dotted black line), 10a′ only (red triangles with solid red line), and 10a′ with NDP (red triangles with dotted red line).

The above in vitro stability and
cell uptake results encouraged
the investigation of 9a′ and 10a′ as potential SPECT peptides for targeting melanoma in vivo. The
biodistribution patterns of 9a′ and 10a′ were examined in B16F10 melanoma mouse xenograft models at 1 and
2 h to quantify the uptake of these peptides following intravenous
administration. The results are presented in Figure . Peptide 9a′ accumulated to the greatest
extent in the liver and kidneys (5.92 ± 0.87% and 2.28 ±
0.18% at 2 h p.i., respectively), although retention in the spleen
and lung was also observed at 2 h p.i. (1.24 ± 0.35% and 1.00
± 0.53%, respectively). Other peptides and small molecule targeting
ligands with fac-[99mTc(CO)3(DPA)]+ complexes have shown similar biodistribution patterns
with high uptake in the hepatobiliary system.,− Using the carboxylate-substituted DPA complex in
peptide 10a′ was anticipated to decrease the hepatobiliary
retention of this analogue relative to 9a′ due
to the increased hydrophilicity of the novel chelate. Compared to 9a′, peptide 10a′ exhibited greater
renal (3.69 ± 0.40%) than hepatic (2.52 ± 0.61%) accumulation
at 2 h p.i.; retention of 10a′ in the blood (1.91
± 0.33%), lung (1.50 ± 0.48%), pancreas (0.91 ± 0.25%),
and intestine (2.87 ± 0.63%) was also higher compared to 9a′ at 2 h p.i. (0.61 ± 0.10%, 1.00 ± 0.53%,
0.07 ± 0.03%, and 0.49 ± 0.15% for blood, lung, pancreas,
and intestine, respectively). The different accumulations of 9a′ and 10a′ observed in the liver
and kidneys confirmed that incorporation of the carboxylates on the
DPA complex in 10a′ altered the properties of
the resulting radiopharmaceutical in vivo compared to the original
DPA complex in 9a′. However, the amount of 10a′ observed in the intestines suggests the desired
goal of decreasing hepatobiliary retention by using the hydrophilic
complex was not achieved. The lower level of 9a′ in the intestines at 2 h (0.49 ± 0.15%) compared to 10a′ (2.87 ± 0.63%) suggests that the carboxylate substitutions
may have increased the rate of clearance through the liver without
significantly modifying total hepatobiliary uptake. Although the greater
levels of 10a′ in the kidneys and in the blood
and could be due to its increased hydrophilicity (compared to 9a′), prolonged blood retention of the radionuclide
using this analogue would adversely affect signal-to-noise ratios
of MC1R-expressing tissues during SPECT imaging.

Biodistribution (A) and
tumor-to-normal tissue ratios (B) of 9a′ and 10a′ in B16F10 tumor-bearing
C57BL/6 mice 1 and 2 h after injection of approximately 100 μCi
of 9a′ and 10a′ via the tail
vein. Data are expressed as % ID/g ± standard deviation (n = 4 per group).

The two different chelates did not appear to affect MC1R
affinity
in vivo as tumor uptake was comparable for both peptides, reaching
0.79 ± 0.19% for 9a′ and 1.06 ± 0.16%
for 10a′ at 1 h p.i. and declining to 0.73 ±
0.05% for 9a′ and 0.71 ± 0.14% for 10a′ at 2 h p.i. The tumor-to-blood ratio (Figure ) slightly increased for 9a′ at 2 h p.i. (1.2 ± 0.13) compared to 1 h p.i. (0.7 ± 0.17)
as would be desired for obtaining SPECT images of target tissues with
low background levels at later time points. Although the amount of 10a′ in the blood also decreased over time, its higher
overall blood retention led to lower tumor-to-blood ratios (∼0.4
at both 1 and 2 h p.i.) compared to 9a′. Many
tissues (stomach, brain, muscle, bone, skin) exhibited lower uptake
and retention of 9a′ and 10a′ compared to the melanoma tumors (Figure ) as would be desired for diagnostic imaging of malignant melanoma.
However, due to the rates of melanoma metastases in the hepatobiliary
and gastrointestinal systems, additional
modifications to 9a′ and 10a′ would be required to minimize the nonspecific retention of these
peptides in soft tissues prior to further development in SPECT imaging
applications.

A variety of chelates for the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core have been designed
with modifications
to increase the hydrophilicity and renal clearance of the resulting
complexes.,,,, Several have
employed the single amino acid chelate (SAAC) approach which is useful
for inserting ligands at nearly any desired location in peptides made
by solid phase synthesis.,, Pyrazolyl chelates modified with carboxylate groups have also been
employed in α-MSH peptides for targeting melanoma. Both strategies have successfully produced peptides
with lower soft tissue retention and greater excretion through renal
rather than hepatobiliary pathways compared to unmodified chelate
structures. The DPA chelates used in the present study were intended
to build on the above concepts by employing a versatile linker strategy
that could be utilized with peptides or even larger macromolecules
produced by both synthetic and recombinant techniques. Such techniques
could be used to insert azide-bearing residues (or orthogonal reactive
groups for selectively incorporating azides) for chelate attachment
via CuAAC at potentially at any location in the sequence of the biomolecule,
thus promoting the flexibility of the chelation strategy used here
compared to the other strategies mentioned above.

While the
chelates and CuAAC strategies used here are expected
to be generally applicable for labeling biomolecules with the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core, several
limitations are worth noting. First, it is possible that incorporating
modified residues within highly optimized targeting ligands (e.g.,
small molecules, short peptides) could negatively affect their binding
affinities or pharmacokinetic properties compared to the original
targeting moiety. Second, the unstable nature of the metal-complexed
α-MSH peptides generated through the click, then chelate route in this study suggests that residual Cu from the CuAAC reaction
can potentially lead to undefined fac-[MI(CO)3]+ complexes during applications with
complex biomolecules. This drawback, along with other limitations
associated with CuAAC click reactions (e.g., purification requirements
to avoid Cu toxicity, transchelation, etc.) must be considered during
future applications with the click, then chelate strategy
in particular. Additionally, using the carboxylate-modified DPA complex
with the α-MSH peptide in the present study did not lead to
the desired decrease in hepatobiliary retention compared to the unmodified
DPA complex. Despite these observations, the hydrophilic ligand for
the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core in the chelate, then click strategy confirmed
that its incorporation into a targeting peptide did not significantly
impair peptide function when compared with a known DPA complex containing
the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core. The chelate, then click strategy prevents
the possibility of undefined or unstable coordination isomers of the
metal core at undesired sites in targeting biomolecules and can allow
even temperature-sensitive biomolecules to be rapidly labeled with
the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core under mild conditions. Therefore,
utilizing this strategy with either of the metal complexes from the
present study would be suitable for generating a wide variety of targeting
radiopharmaceuticals in future applications.

Conclusions
In
summary, a novel chelate based on DPA with enhanced hydrophilicity
has been developed and utilized with the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core. Structural assessment
using Re and radiolabeling studies with 99mTc demonstrated
that this chelate’s performance was comparable to a well characterized
DPA ligand. An α-MSH analogue with an S-functionalized
azide linker was used as a model biomolecule to incorporate the alkyne-functionalized
chelates and fac-[MI(CO)3]+ complexes into the peptides via CuAAC reactions. Metal complexation
through the click, then chelate route produced peptides
with inferior in vitro properties compared to those generated by the chelate, then click strategy. The fac-[MI(CO)3]+-complexed analogues generated
by the chelate, then click strategy were stable to
transchelation, possessed high affinity for the MC1R, and demonstrated
encouraging uptake values in B16F10 melanoma cells in vitro. Biodistribution
analysis of the peptides bearing the two different DPA chelates demonstrated
moderately low uptake in melanoma xenografts in vivo. While the α-MSH
peptide with the new carboxylate-functionalized complex showed slightly
increased renal accumulation and less hepatic retention than the alternative
hydrophobic analogue, the desired goal of decreasing hepatobiliary
retention by increasing the hydrophilicity of this analogue was not
obtained. However, the versatility of the chelate, then click strategy with either of the chelates used here maintains the potential
to incorporate the fac-[MI(CO)3]+ core into a wide variety of biomolecules bearing azide
moieties for generating targeted radiopharmaceuticals via CuAAC.

Cys-NAPamide Analogue Synthesis,
Functionalization, and Complexation
Reactions
Ac-Cys-Nle-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-NH2, 5
The starting peptide 5 (also
abbreviated as Cys-NAPamide) was synthesized on an automated CS Bio
CS336 peptide synthesizer (CS Bio Company, Inc., Menlo Park, CA) using
standard solid-phase techniques with Fmoc-protected amino acids. Briefly,
Rink Amide LS resin (220 mg, 0.2 mmol, 0.44 mmol/g loading capacity)
was presuspended and swollen in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) for 30 min. Fmoc groups on the resin beads were deprotected
with 20% piperidine in DMF. For every step, each Fmoc-protected amino
acid (1 mmol) was activated in a solution containing 1 mmol HOBt and
1 M diisopropylcarbodiimide in DMF. After deprotection of the Fmoc
protection group of the last amino acid residue, the N-terminal residue was acetylated by acetic anhydride with HOBt/diisopropylethylamine.
The resultant peptide was cleaved and deprotected by a 3 h incubation
in a mixture of TFA/triisopropylsilane/1,2-ethanedithiol/H2O (94:2:2:2). The crude peptide was filtered, and then precipitated
with ice-cold anhydrous diethyl ether. The resulting peptide pellet
was washed four times with ice-cold anhydrous diethyl ether, dried
under a flow of N2, and dissolved in a 1 mM dithiothreitol
solution. The crude peptide was purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC
with solvents A (0.1% TFA in H2O) and C (0.1% TFA in MeCN)
using a linear gradient from 95% A/5% C to 35% A/65% C over 45 min
at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. Purified fractions were collected and
lyophilized to yield the desired peptide, 5, in 83% yield
and &gt;95% purity by analytical RP-HPLC using HPLC method 3 (gradient

peptide, and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 12 h.
The reaction mixture was subsequently concentrated by rotary evaporation
and purified by RP-HPLC using HPLC method 3. MeCN was removed from
the purified product fractions under vacuum, and the resulting purified
solution was frozen and lyophilized overnight to yield 1.6 mg (70%)

Ellman’s Test for
Thiol Content
Peptide 6 was analyzed by a 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman’s reagent)
assay according
to instructions from Pierce, with slight modifications. Briefly, triplicate
solutions of 6 at 3.5 × 10–4 to
4 × 10–4 M in 50 μL H2O were
combined with 500 μL Ellman’s buffer (0.1 M pH 8 sodium
phosphate with 1 mM EDTA) and 10 μL DTNB dissolved at 4 mg/mL
in Ellman’s buffer. The solutions were vortexed and allowed
to sit at room temperature for 15 min, and the UV absorbance of the
solutions at 412 nm was determined. The amount of free thiol remaining
in the peptide solutions was quantified by comparing the absorbance
values at 412 nm to a standard curve generated by performing the assay
with freshly prepared solutions of l-cysteine at known concentrations.

General
Procedures for 99mTc Reactions with Small
Molecule Ligands
Solutions of 1 or 3 in 10 mM pH 7.2 PBS (400–450 μL) were sealed in 5 mL
labeling vials and the vials were purged with N2 for 5–10
min. Solutions of fac-[99mTcI(OH2)3(CO)3]+ (50–100
μL, 0.98–1.37 mCi) were added to bring the final ligand
concentrations to 1 × 10–4 to 1 × 10–6 M in final volumes of 500 μL, and the vials
were heated at 70 °C for 30–60 min. The vials were cooled
prior to analysis and purification by radio-HPLC using HPLC method
1.

General Procedures for 99mTc Reactions with Peptides
Click, then chelate route: Solutions of peptides 7 or 8 (2.5 × 10–8 mol)
dissolved in 400 μL 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS were sealed in 5 mL labeling
vials and purged with N2 for 5–10 min. 100 uL of fac-[99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ (0.76–0.81 mCi) was added to yield final
peptide concentrations of 5 × 10–5 M. The reactions
were heated at 70 °C for a total of 1 h with monitoring by RP-HPLC
using HPLC method 1 or HPLC method 6 (solvents A and B; 1 mL/min flow
rate; 0–8 min 62% A/38% B, 8–26 min linear gradient
to 100% B, 26–30 min hold 100% B, return to 62% A/38% B after
30 min and equilibrate; UV at 220, 238, or 254 nm). Peptides were
purified by HPLC method 1 or HPLC method 6. Chelate, then
click route: Crude reaction mixtures of either 2a or 4a (200 μL, 0.34–0.60 mCi) containing
ligands 1 or 3 at 5.25 × 10–5 M were added to a solution containing peptide 6 (2.6
× 10–8 mol) and sodium ascorbate (2 ×
10–6 mol) in 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS (275 μL) in
5 mL labeling vials. After the vials were sealed and purged with N2 for 5 min, Cu(OAc)2 (1 × 10–6 mol) was added to give a final volume of 500 μL with peptide 6 at 5.2 × 10–5 M, ligands 1 or 3 at 2.1 × 10–5 M, sodium
ascorbate at 4 × 10–3 M, and Cu(OAc)2 at 2 × 10–3 M. The vials were then heated
with stirring at 50 °C for a total of 1 h with periodic monitoring
by radio-HPLC using HPLC method 6. Peptides were purified by either
HPLC method 1 or HPLC method 6.

Stability Analysis
Solutions of HPLC-purified 4a, 9a, 9a′, 10a, or 10a′ (200
μL, MeOH removed under a
stream of N2 following isolation) were combined with solutions
containing l-histidine or l-cysteine at 2 ×
10–3 M in 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS (200 μL) in 5 mL
labeling vials. Vials were sealed, purged with N2 for 5
min, and incubated at 37 °C for a total of 18 h (9a, 9a′, 10a, and 10a′) or 24 h (4a) with periodic analysis by radio-HPLC
using HPLC methods 1 or 6. Serum stability of 4a was
determined by incubating solutions of HPLC-purified 4a (200 μL) in mouse serum (200 μL, clarified by centrifugation)
in 5 mL labeling vials. Vials were sealed, purged with N2 for 5 min, and incubated at 37 °C for a total of 24 h. At periodic
time points, aliquots were removed, counted, and added to an equal
volume of ice-cold ethanol to precipitate proteins from the solution.
This mixture was centrifuged and the supernatants were counted and
analyzed by radio-HPLC using HPLC method 1. Serum stability of the
peptides was analyzed by incubating solutions of HPLC-purified 9a, 9a′, 10a, or 10a′ (100 μCi) in 50 μL of 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS with mouse serum
(500 μL) at 37 °C for a total of 6 h. At periodic time
points, the solutions were filtered through a centrifugal filter (10
K; Millipore Corp.) and the filtrate was analyzed by radio-HPLC using
HPLC method 2.

Log P analysis
Equal volumes of
10 mM pH 7.4 PBS and
1-octanol (500 μL each) were vortexed (30 s) in centrifuge tubes
and allowed to separate (2 min). HPLC-purified solutions of 2a, 4a, 9a′, or 10a′ (0.1 μCi in 2–15 μL, MeOH removed under a stream
of N2 following isolation) were added to triplicate sets
of tubes after an equal volume of the aqueous phase was removed, and
the tubes were vortexed (1 min) and centrifuged (2000 × g, 5 min). Aliquots (50 μL) from each layer were removed
and counted to determine the ratio of radioactivity present in the
octanol layer compared to the aqueous layer.

In Vitro and
In Vivo Biological Evaluations
Cell Culture and Animal
Model
Cell growth and tumor
implantation procedures were performed as previously described. Briefly, B16F10 murine melanoma cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s high-glucose medium (GIBCO,
Carlsbad, CA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
1% penicillin–streptomycin in a humidified incubator containing
5% CO2 at 37 °C. A 70–80% confluent monolayer
was detached with 0.25% trypsin–EDTA and dissociated into a
single-cell suspension for further cell culture and assays. All animal
studies were carried out in compliance with federal and local institutional
rules for the conduct of animal experimentation. Approximately 1 ×
106 cultured B16F10 cells were suspended in 100 μL
of PBS and subcutaneously implanted in the right shoulders of C57BL/6
mice. Tumors were grown to a size of 0.5–1 cm in diameter (1–2
weeks) prior to biodistribution studies.

In Vitro IC50 Cell Binding Analysis
The
MC1R binding affinity of 5, 6, 9′, and 10′ in B16F10 cells was performed as previously
described. Briefly, B16F10 cells (5 ×
105) suspended in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (DMEM) containing 25 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid), 0.2% bovine serum albumin,
and 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline were seeded at a density of 0.3 million
per well in 96-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. The cells
were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 125I-(Tyr2)-NDP (20 000 counts per minute) and 5, 6, 9′, or 10′ (peptide concentration varying from 10–11 to 10–5 M). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold 10
mM pH 7.4 PBS and lysed in 1 mL of 1.0 M NaOH containing 0.1% sodium
dodecyl sulfate. The radioactivity of the lysed cells was measured
by a γ-counter (Perkin-Elmer model 1470). The experiment was
performed in quadruplicate wells. The IC50 values (the
concentration of competitor required to inhibit 50% of the radioligand
binding) of the peptides were calculated by using Origin 8.0 (MicroCal).

In Vitro B16F10 Melanoma Cell Uptake Assays
Cell uptake
studies of 9a′ and 10a′ were
performed as previously described. Briefly,
B16F10 cells (3 × 105) were seeded in 12-well tissue
culture plates and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The cells were
washed with 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS and then incubated with 9a′ or 10a′ (1 μCi per well, in DMEM) with
or without NDP (3 μM/well) at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, and 2 h.
The cells were then washed 3 times with 10 mM pH 7.4 PBS and lysed
in 1 mL of 1.0 M NaOH containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and transferred
to γ-counter tubes. Radioactivity was measured by a γ-counter
(Perkin-Elmer model 1470). Cell uptake was expressed as the percentage
of added radioactivity. Experiments were performed twice with quadruplicate
wells.

In Vivo B16F10 Melanoma Xenograft Mouse Biodistribution Analysis
For biodistribution studies, female C57BL/6 mice bearing B16F10
xenografts (n = 4 per group) were injected via the
tail vein with approximately 100 μCi of 9a′ or 10a′ and were euthanized at 1 and 2 h post
injection (p.i.). Tumor and normal tissues of interest were removed
and weighed, and their radioactivity was measured using a γ-counter.
Radioactivity uptake was expressed as a percentage of the injected
radioactive dose per gram of tissue (% ID/g).

Statistical
Methods
Statistical analysis was performed
using the Student’s t test for unpaired data.
A 95% confidence level was chosen to determine the significance between
groups, with P &lt; 0.05 being designated as significantly
different.
