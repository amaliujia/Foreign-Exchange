Introduction
Integrin αvβ3 plays a significant
role in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis,− and is a receptor for extracellular
matrix proteins (such as vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, laminin,
collagen, Von Willebrand’s factor, and osteoponin) with the
arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptide sequence. Over last several years, many radiolabeled (99mTc, 18F, 64Cu, 68Ga, and 111In) cyclic RGD peptides have been evaluated as radiotracers for tumor
imaging by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron
emission tomography (PET),− and have been reviewed extensively.− The cyclic RGD peptides, such as E[c(RGDfK)]2 (RGD2), are targeting biomolecules to carry radionuclide
to the integrin αvβ3 overexpressed
on the tumor cells and/or tumor neovasculature. Multiple cyclic RGD
peptides have been utilized to maximize their integrin αvβ3 binding affinity and the radiotracer tumor
uptake. It was found that radiolabeled multimeric cyclic RGD peptides
had significantly higher tumor uptake with longer tumor retention
time than their monomeric counterparts. The linkers between the two c(RGDfK) moieties in dimeric cyclic
RGD peptides (Figure ) are also important
for their tumor-targeting capability and excretion kinetics of 99mTc radiotracers.

Chemdraw structures of cyclic RGD peptides (c(RGDfK),
RGD2, 3P-RGD2, P6G-RGD2, P6D-RGD2, and
their corresponding ternary ligand complexes [99mTc(HYNIC-BM)(tricine)(TPPTS)]
(BM = biomolecule; 99mTc-RGD2: BM = RGD2; 99mTc-3P-RGD2: BM = 3P-RGD2; 99mTc-P6G-RGD2: BM = P6G-RGD2, 99mTc-P6D-RGD2: BM = P6D-RGD2).

Many water-soluble linkers have
been proposed to improve pharmacokinetics
of radiolabeled cyclic RGD peptides.,− For example, 7-amino-l-glycero-l-galacto-2,6-anhydro-7-deoxyheptanamide
(SAA) has successfully used to minimize the liver radioactivity accumulation
and increase target-to-background ratios of 18F-labeled
cyclic RGD peptides., The (cysteic acid)2 dipeptide was utilized to minimize the liver uptake of radiolabeled
integrin αvβ3 antagonists.− The hexaethylene glycol (HEG) has been incorporated in 18F-labeled RGDfE dimers and tetramers.− It was reported that
the polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers could improve not only the tumor
uptake but also the pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled c(RGDyK) and 64Cu-labeled E[c(RGDyK)]2.−

We have
been using 15-amino-4,7,10,13-tetraoxapentadecanoic acid
(PEG4) and Gly-Gly-Gly (G3) as linkers to maximize
the tumor-targeting capability and improve excretion kinetics of 99mTc labeled cyclic RGD peptides.− In this study, we used the Asp-Asp-Asp (D3) tripeptide
sequence to prepare HYNIC-P6D-RGD2 (HYNIC = 6-(2-(2-sulfonatobenzaldehyde)hydrazono)nicotinyl;
P6D-RGD2 = PEG4-E[c(RGDfK(D3))]2). We were interested in P6D-RGD2 because it contains
two D3 linkers with six carboxylic groups that could be
deprotonated under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4). It was reported
that the D3 linker was able to minimize the liver radioactivity
accumulation of 99mTc-labeled c(RGDfK). For comparison purpose, we also prepared HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 (P6G-RGD2 = PEG4-E[c(RGDfK(G3))]2) due to the neutral charges of G3 tripeptide
sequences. We evaluated the ternary ligand complexes [99mTc(HYNIC-P6G-RGD2)(tricine)(TPPTS)] (Figure : 99mTc-P6G-RGD2) and [99mTc(HYNIC-P6D-RGD2)(tricine)(TPPTS)] (99mTc-P6D-RGD2) in the athymic nude mice bearing U87MG glioma xenografts
to explore the impact of multiple negative overall molecular charges
on blood clearance kinetics and biodistribution properties of 99mTc radiotracers. SPECT/CT studies were performed using 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 in athymic nude mice bearing U87MG
glioma and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts to demonstrate its
utility as a radiotracer for tumor imaging.

Results
Bioconjugate
Synthesis
HYNIC-P6D-RGD2 and
HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 were prepared by direct conjugation of P6D-RGD2 and P6G-RGD2, respectively, with HYNIC-OSu in
the presence of excess DIEA. The reaction between P6D-RGD2 and HYNIC-OSu was slow at room temperature (∼15 days to complete).
The reaction between P6G-RGD2 and HYNIC-OSu was completed
within 3 days at room temperature. It seems that the addition of six
carboxylic groups between the two c(RGDfK) moieties make the conjugation
reaction slower. HYNIC-P6D-RGD2 and HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 were purified by HPLC, and have been characterized by MALDI mass
spectroscopy. The MS data were completely consistent with their proposed
composition. Their HPLC purity was &gt;95% before being used for the
integrin αvβ3 binding assays and 99mTc-labeling.

Integrin αvβ3 Binding Affinity
Figure  shows
the displacement curves of 125I-echistatin bound to U87MG
human glioma cells in the presence
of cyclic RGD peptides. For comparison purposes, we also evaluated
c(RGDyK) and HYNIC-RGD2 in the same assay. IC50 values were calculated to be 31 ± 5, 41 ± 6, 85 ±
2, and 422 ± 15 nM for HYNIC-P6G-RGD2, HYNIC-P6G-RGD2, HYNIC-RGD2, and c(RGDyK), respectively. The integrin
αvβ3 binding affinity follows the
order of HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 ∼ HYNIC-P6D-RGD2 &gt; HYNIC-RGD2 ≫ c(RGDyK). The IC50 values
of HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 and HYNIC-P6D-RGD2 were very
close to that of HYNIC-3P-RGD2 (IC50 = 32 ±
1 nM; 3P-RGD2: PEG4-E[PEG4-c(RGKfD)]2 and PEG4 = 15-amino-4,7,10,13-tetraoxapentadecanoic
acid) reported in our previous studies., Apparently,
replacing the two neutral G3 or PEG4 linkers
with a pair of triple-charged D3 tripeptide sequences did
not significantly alter the integrin αvβ3 binding affinity of dimeric cyclic RGD peptides.

respectively.

Radiochemistry
99mTc-labeling was accomplished
by heating the reaction mixture at 100 °C for 15–20 min.
Figure  shows radio-HPLC chromatograms of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 in the kit matrix. Their RCP was &gt;95% without postlabeling
chromatographic purification. The specific activity was 37–110
GBq/μmol for 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6G-RGD2. They both remained stable in the kit matrix
for more than 6 h postlabeling.

Biodistribution Properties
Biodistribution
studies
were performed on 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 to compare their blood clearance, tumor uptake,
and biodistribution properties in athymic nude mice bearing U87MG
glioma xenografts. Tables  and  list the selected biodistribution data for 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6G-RGD2,
respectively. For comparison purposes, we also obtained the 5 and
60 min biodistribution data of 99mTc-3P-RGD2 (Figure : [99mTc(HYNIC-3P-RGD2)(tricine)(TPPTS)]), which is currently under clinical evaluations
as a SPECT radiotracer for imaging integrin αvβ3-positive tumors.− It was found that the most significant
difference between 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 was their blood activity levels and tumor
uptake. The blood activity level of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 was 4.71 ± 1.00%ID/g, ∼5× higher than that of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 (0.88 ± 0.05%ID/g) and ∼3×
higher than that of 99mTc-3P-RGD2 (1.45 ±
0.40%ID/g) at 5 min p.i., but this difference disappeared at 60 min
p.i. (Figure ). The tumor uptake of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 (2.20 ± 0.42, 2.85 ± 0.55, 3.11
± 0.47, and 2.45 ± 0.90%ID/g at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min p.i.,
respectively) was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01)
than that of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 (9.27 ± 0.72,
8.85 ± 0.67, 8.17 ± 1.10, and 7.82 ± 0.76%ID/g at 5,
30, 60, and 120 min p.i., respectively) over the 2 h study period.
In contrast, 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2 shared similar blood clearance kinetics (Figure ), and tumor uptake values (7.82–9.27%ID/g
for 99mTc-P6G-RGD2; and 7.24–8.72%ID/g
for 99mTc-3P-RGD2). The kidney uptake of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 (Table )
was also significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) than
that of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 (Table ). However, 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 had the intestine
uptake values of 5.86 ± 1.37, 6.58 ± 0.88, 7.08 ± 0.92,
and 4.74 ± 0.33%ID/g at 5, 30, 60, and 120 min p.i., respectively,
which were much lower (p &lt; 0.01) than those of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 (11.72 ± 2.01, 9.27 ± 1.15,
6.17 ± 1.55, and 4.74 ± 1.09%ID/g at 5, 30, 60, and 120
min p.i., respectively) over the 2 h study period. Obviously, the
linker groups between two cyclic RGD moieties have a significant impact
on the blood clearance kinetics (Figure ),
tumor uptake, and biodistribution properties (Figure ) of 99mTc-labeled dimeric cyclic RGD peptides.

moieties on blood clearance kinetics of 99mTc-labeled cyclic
RGD peptide dimers.

Integrin αvβ3 Specificity
Figure A compares the 60 min biodistribution
data of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 in the athymic nude mice
bearing U87MG human glioma xenografts in the absence/presence of excess
RGD2. Co-injection of excess RGD2 significantly
blocked its tumor uptake (0.30 ± 0.01%ID/g with RGD2 v 3.13 ± 0.47%ID/g without RGD2). There was also
a significant blockage of its uptake in several integrin αvβ3-positive normal organs by coinjection
of excess RGD2. For example, the 60 min uptake values of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 in the intestine, lungs, and spleen
was 7.08 ± 0.92, 1.85 ± 0.20, and 2.58 ± 0.46%ID/g,
respectively, without RGD2, while its uptake in the same
organs was only 0.22 ± 0.11, 0.29 ± 0.01, and 0.14 ±
0.01%ID/g, respectively, in the presence of excess RGD2. These data clearly showed that the tumor uptake of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 is integrin αvβ3-specific. A similar conclusion could also be made on the
basis of planar imaging data (Figure B) of
the U87MG glioma-bearing mice in the absence/presence of excess RGD2.

SPECT/CT Imaging and Immunohistochemistry
Data
We obtained
the SPECT/CT images (Figure A) of the athymic
nude mice bearing xenografted U87MG glioma and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor
administered with ∼37 MBq of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2. We were interested in 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 because
of its higher tumor uptake than that of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2. It was found that the tumors were clearly visualized with
excellent contrast in both animal models. Its tumor uptake was ∼8.2%ID/cm3 in the U87MG glioma and 3.5%ID/cm3 in the MDA-MB-231
breast tumor on the basis of SPECT quantification. To explain the
uptake difference between U87MG and MDA-MB-231 tumors, we obtained
microscopic images (Figure B) of selected
tumor slice stained with anti-integrin β3 (red color)
and anti-CD31 (green color) antibody. CD31 was used as a biomarker
for tumor blood vessels (both mature and neovasculature), and was
visualized with FITC (green). Integrin β3 was visualized
with Cy3 (red). Yellow color (red β3 staining verged
with green CD31 staining) in overlay images indicates the presence
of integrin αvβ3 on neovasculature.
It was clear that integrin αvβ3 was
highly expressed on U87MG glioma cells and neovasculature, which was
in complete agreement with the high uptake of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 in U87MG glioma tumors (Figure A).
In contrast, the xenografted MDA-MB-231 breast tumors had relatively
high expression of integrin αvβ3 on tumor cells with limited integrin αvβ3 expression on neovasculature, as indicated by the lack of
yellow and orange colors in overlay images. As a result, 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 had lower uptake in the MDA-MB-231 breast
tumors than that in U87MG glioma (Figure A).

their potential utility for tumor imaging. (B) Selected microscopic
images (Magnification: 200×) of the tumor slice stained with

of integrin αvβ3 on the tumor neovasculature.

Discussion
There
are two biologically important interactions (Chart : receptor binding and protein binding) once a radiotracer
is injected into the blood circulation. Receptor binding is necessary
for the radiotracer to selectively localize in the targeted organ
or tissue (e.g., tumor). Higher receptor binding affinity will lead
to more radiotracer initial tumor uptake with a longer tumor retention
time. Protein bonding is often detrimental because it will reduce
the number of radiotracer molecules available for receptor binding,
and result in more initial blood radioactivity accumulation (Chart ). Therefore, the protein bonding should be minimized
for the receptor-based target-specific radiotracers. In addition,
more hydrophilic radiotracers tend to increase renal excretion, which
will lead to lower background radioactivity in the blood pool and
normal organs (e.g., liver, lungs, and muscle) with better target-to-background
ratios. In contrast, more lipophilic radiotracers tend to have extensive
metabolism, which often results in lower tumor uptake with poorer
target-to-background ratios.

Schematic Illustration of Biological
Interactions and Elimination
Routes of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2
In this
study, we found that the negative charges had very little
impact on integrin αvβ3 binding
affinity of HYNIC-conjugated cyclic RGD dimers (Figure : IC50 = 40 ± 6 nM for HYNIC-P6D-RGD2; and IC50 = 32 ± 5 nM for HYNIC-P6G-RGD2). However, they have a dramatic impact on the blood clearance kinetics
(Figure ), tumor uptake, and biodistribution
(Figure ) of their 99mTc radiotracers
(99mTc-P6D-RGD2 versus 99mTc-P6G-RGD2). Therefore, this difference is most likely related to their
overall molecular charge and their protein binding capability.

P6D-RGD2 contains two D3 tripeptide sequences
with six carboxylic groups. Due to their low pKa values (4.5–5.0 for aliphatic acids), they are all
expected to be deprotonated under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4). 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 has a total of nine negative molecular
charges (Chart ), which provide a strong driving
force to interact with the positively charged amino residues, such
as arginine and lysine. The stronger protein binding leads to higher
initial blood activity level (Figure ), lower
tumor uptake and higher kidney uptake of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 than those of both 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2 (Figure ),
in which the G3 and PEG4 linkers are neutral
under physiological conditions.

One might ask why one D3 linker is able to minimize
the liver uptake of 99mTc-labeled c(RGDfK), while 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 has
such a high initial blood activity level (Figure ). The answer lies in the differences of their overall negative
molecular charges. In 99mTc-labeled c(RGDfK), the D3 linker offers only three negative charges, which was not
sufficient for strong protein binding. In 99mTc-P6D-RGD2, the combination of two D3 linkers with the triple-charged
TPPTS yields a total of nine negative charges. As a result, 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 is able to form a stronger protein binding
(Chart ), leading to high initial blood radioactivity
(Figure ) and low tumor uptake (Figure ). It must be noted that protein binding is reversible,
and the protein-bound 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 became
dissociated. It is not surprising that all three radiotracers shared
almost identical blood radioactivity levels at 60 min p.i. (Figure ).

It remains unknown which protein 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 is bonded to. However, albumin is the most
abundant protein in the
blood plasma.− The normal concentration range is 35–50 g/L
for human serum albumin (HSA). HSA consists of three homologous domains
(I, II, and III) and each domain is formed by two subdomains (A and
B)., The results from X-ray analysis of different
ligand–HSA complexes showed the existence of two binding sites
in the II and III domains. Subdomains IIA and IIIA contain deep pockets,
the entrance of which is surrounded by positively charged amino acid
residues. Thus, these pockets are potential
binding sites for 99mTc-P6D-RGD2. If the radiotracer
contains multiple negative charges (e.g., two D3 linkers
in 99mTc-P6D-RGD2), the interaction between
radiotracer and albumin may become significant. This might explain
why 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 has much higher initial blood
radioactivity than 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2 (Figure ) while the
D3 linker is able to reduce the liver uptake for 99mTc-labeled c(RGDfK).

99mTc-P6D-RGD2 is not a good radiotracer
for tumor imaging due to its high protein binding and low tumor uptake.
However, this finding may have important applications in the design
of albumin-targeted contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) angiography.− For the receptor-based radiotracers, protein binding
will reduce the number of radiolabeled biomolecules for receptor binding
and the radiotracer uptake in the targeted tissues. For albumin-targeted
contrast agents, albumin binding will reduce the tumbling rate of
Gd(III) chelates, increase the relaxivity of Gd(III) contrast agents,
and decrease the doses administered to each subject.

Despite its low uptake in U87MG glioma tumors, the
tumor uptake
of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 was integrin αvβ3-specific, as illustrated by the blocking experiments
(Figure ). SPECT/CT data clearly shows the
tumor-targeting capability of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2, and its uptake is dependent on the integrin αvβ3 expression levels on tumor cells and neovasculature
(Figure ). If the integrin αvβ3 expression level is high on both tumor cells
and neovasculature, 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 will have
high tumor uptake. If the integrin αvβ3 expression level is low on either tumor cells or tumor neovasculature,
the tumor uptake of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 will be lower.
Therefore, 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 has the potential
as a screening tool for cancer patients before the anti-αvβ3 treatment.

Conclusion
The
most important finding of this study is that the multiple negative
charges have a significant detrimental effect on the blood clearance
kinetics and tumor uptake of 99mTc-labeled dimeric cyclic
RGD peptides. As a result of its higher protein binding, 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 had much lower tumor uptake than 99mTc-P6G-RGD2.

(Chicago, IL). The MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization)
data were collected on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE PRO mass spectrometer
(Framingham, MA), the Department of Chemistry, Purdue University.

HPLC Methods
The semiprep HPLC method (Method 1) used
a LabAlliance HPLC system (Scientific Systems, Inc., State College,
PA) equipped with a UV/vis detector (λ = 254 nm) and Zorbax
C18 column (9.4 mm × 250 mm, 100 Å pore size;
Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The flow rate was 2.5 mL/min
with a mobile phase being isocratic with 90% A (0.1% TFA in acetonitrile)
and 10% B (0.1% TFA in water) over the first 5 min, followed by a
gradient mobile phase going from 90% A and 10% B at 5 min, and to
60% A and 40% B at 20 min. The radio-HPLC method (Method 2) used the
LabAlliance HPLC system equipped with a β-ram IN/US detector
(Tampa, FL) and Zorbax C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm,
300 Å pore size; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The
flow rate was 1 mL/min. The mobile phase was isocratic for the first
5 min with 90% A (25 mM NH4OAc, pH = 6.8) and 10% B (acetonitrile),
followed by a gradient mobile phase going from 90% A and 10% B at
5 min to 60% A and 60% B at 20 min.

HYNIC-PEG4-E[c(RGDfK(D3))]2 (HYNIC-P6D-RGD2)
HYNIC-OSu
(5.4 mg, 12 μmol)
and P6D-RGD2 (4.5 mg, 2 μmol) were dissolved in anhydrous
DMF (1.5 mL). Upon addition of excess diisopropylethylamine (DIEA:
50 μmol), the reaction mixture was stirred for ∼15 days
at room temperature. To the reaction mixture was added 2 mL of water.
The pH value was adjusted to 3–4 using TFA. The product was
separated from the reaction mixture by HPLC (Method 1). Fractions
at ∼18 min were collected. Lyophilization of the combined fractions
afforded HYNIC-P6D-RGD2 as a white powder. The yield was
2.5 mg (∼48%) with &gt;95% HPLC purity. MALDI-MS: m/z = 2557.2 for [M + H]+ (exact mass
= 2557.99 calcd. for [C107H147N29O43S]).

HYNIC-PEG4-E[c(RGDfK(G3))]2 (HYNIC-P6G-RGD2)
HYNIC-NHS (4.6
mg, 11 μmol)
and P6G-RGD2 (5 mg, 2.6 μmol) were dissolved in 2.0
mL of anhydrous DMF. After addition of excess DIEA (50 μmol),
the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. To
the reaction mixture was added 2 mL of water after completion of conjugation.
The pH value was adjusted to 3–4 using neat TFA. The product
was separated from reaction mixture by HPLC (Method 1). The fraction
at 20.5 min was collected. Lyophilization of combined fractions afforded
HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 as a white powder. The yield was 2.0 mg
(∼34%) with &gt;95% HPLC purity. MALDI-MS: m/z = 2209.5 for [M + H]+ (exact mass
= 2209.96
calcd. for [C95H135N29O31S]).

99mTc-Labeling
99mTc-P6G-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 were prepared using
a kit formulation according to the literature method., To a lyophilized vial containing 25 μg of HYNIC-P6G-RGD2 or HYNIC-P6D-RGD2, 7 mg TPPTS, 6.5 mg tricine,
40 mg mannitol, 38.5 mg disodium succinate hexahydrate, and 12.7 mg
succinic acid was added 1.0–1.5 mL of Na99mTcO4 solution (370–1110 MBq). The reconstituted vial was
heated in a boiling water bath for 10–20 min. After radiolabeling,
a sample of resulting solution was analyzed by radio-HPLC (Method
2). The radiochemical purity (RCP) was &gt;95% for both 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 and 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 before
being used for imaging and biodistribution studies. The solution stability
was monitored by radio-HPLC for 6 h.

Dose Preparation
For biodistribution, doses were prepared
by dissolving 99mTc radiotracer (no HPLC purification)
in saline to a concentration of ∼1 MBq/mL. Each animal was
injected with ∼0.1 mL of the dose solution. For SPECT/CT imaging,
doses were prepared by dissolving 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 (no HPLC purification) in saline to ∼370 MBq/mL. In the
blocking experiment, RGD2 was dissolved in the dose solution
to 3.5 mg/mL. The resulting dose solution was filtered with a 0.20
μm Millex-LG filter before being injected into animals. Each
animal was injected with ∼0.2 mL of the dose solution.

Tumor
Cell Culture
The U87MG cell line was obtained
from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). U87MG
cells were cultured in the Minimum Essential Medium, Eagle with Earle’s
Balanced Salt Solution (nonessential amino acids sodium pyruvate),
and were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ATCC) and
1% penicillin and streptomycin solution at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were grown as monolayers
and were harvested or split when they reached 90% confluence to maintain
exponential growth.

Integrin αvβ3 Binding Assay
The integrin binding affinity of cyclic RGD
peptides was assessed
via a displacement assay using 125I-echistatin (PerkinElmer,
Branford, CT) as the integrin-specific radioligand. Briefly, the filter
multiscreen DV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were seeded with
1 × 105 U87MG cells in binding buffer (20 mM Tris,
150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin; pH 7.4) and 125I-echistatin (0.75–1.0 kBq) in the presence of increasing
concentrations of the cyclic RGD peptide, incubated for 2 h at room
temperature. After removing unbound 125I-echistatin, the
hydrophilic PVDF filters were washed 3× with the binding buffer,
and then collected. Radioactivity was determined using a PerkinElmer
Wizard 1480 γ-counter (Shelton, CT). Experiments were carried
out twice in triplicate. IC50 values were calculated by
fitting experimental data with nonlinear regression using GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA), and were reported
as an average plus/minus standard deviation.

Animal Models
Biodistribution and imaging studies were
performed in compliance with the NIH animal experimentation guidelines
(Principles of Laboratory Animal Care, NIH Publication
No. 86–23, revised 1985). The protocol was approved by the
Purdue University Animal Care and Use Committee (PACUC). Female athymic nu/nu mice (4–5 weeks) were purchased
from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN), and were inoculated subcutaneously
with 5 × 106 U87MG cells into the shoulder flank of
each animal. Four weeks after inoculation, animals were used for biodistribution
and imaging studies.

Biodistribution Protocol
Twenty
tumor-bearing mice
(20–25 g) were randomly selected, and divided into four groups.
Each animal was administered ∼0.1 MBq of 99mTc
radiotracer by tail vein injection. Five animals were sacrificed by
sodium pentobarbital overdose (∼200 mg/kg) at 5, 30, 60, and
120 min postinjection (p.i.). Blood, tumors, and normal organs (brain,
eyes, heart, spleen, lungs, liver, kidneys, muscle, and intestine)
were harvested, washed with saline, dried with absorbent tissue, weighed,
and counted on a PerkinElmer Wizard 1480 γ-counter. The blocking
experiment was performed using RGD2 as the blocking agent.
Each animal was administered ∼0.1 MBq of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 along with ∼350 μg (∼14 mg/kg) of RGD2. Biodistribution data (%ID/g) and tumor-to-background (T/B)
ratios were all expressed as the average plus/minus standard deviation
standard deviation from five animals. Statistical analysis was performed
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman-Keuls
test for multiple comparisons. The level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

Planar Imaging Protocol
Three animals
bearing U87MG
glioma xenografts were used for the whole-body planar imaging with 99mTc-P6D-RGD2. Tumor-bearing mice were anesthetized
with intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (40–100 mg/kg) and
Xylazine (2–5 mg/kg). Each animal was administered ∼37
MBq of 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 in 0.1 mL of saline solution.
Animals were then placed on a custom-made single head gamma camera
(Diagnostic Services Inc., NJ) equipped with a parallel-hole, medium-energy,
and high-resolution collimator. Static planar images were acquired
at 30, 60, and 120 min p.i. and stored digitally in a 128 × 128
matrix. The acquisition count limits were set at 300 K. In the blocking
experiment, 99mTc-P6D-RGD2 was coinjected with
RGD2 (∼14 mg/kg or ∼350 μg per 25 g
tumor-bearing mouse). Such a large excess of RGD2 was used
to make sure that the integrin αvβ3 binding sites are completely blocked. After planar imaging, the
tumor-bearing animals were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital overdose
(100–200 mg/kg).

SPECT/CT Imaging
SPECT/CT images
were obtained using
a u-SPECT-II/CT scanner (Milabs, Utrecht, The Netherlands) equipped
with a 0.6 mm multi-pinhole collimator. The glioma-bearing mouse was
injected with ∼37 MBq of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 in 0.1 mL saline via the tail vein. At 60 min p.i., the animal was
placed into a shielded chamber connected to an isoflurane anesthesia
unit (Univentor, Zejtun, Malta). Anesthesia was induced using an air
flow rate of 350 mL/min and ∼3.0% isoflurane. After induction
of anesthesia, the animal was immediately placed supine on the scanning
bed. The air flow rate was then reduced to ∼250 mL/min with
∼2.0% isoflurane. Rectangular scans in the regions of interest
(ROIs) from SPECT and CT were selected on the basis of orthogonal
optical images provided by the integrated webcams. After SPECT (75
projections over 30 min per frame, 2 frames), the animal was transferred
into the CT scanner and imaged using “normal” acquisition
settings (2° intervals) at 45 kV and 500 μA. After CT acquisition,
the animal was allowed to recover in a lead-shielded cage.

Image
Reconstruction and Data Processing
SPECT reconstruction
was performed using a POSEM (pixelated ordered subsets by expectation
maximization) algorithm with 6 iterations and 16 subsets. CT data
were reconstructed using a cone-beam filtered back-projection algorithm
(NRecon v 1.6.3, Skyscan). After reconstruction, the SPECT and CT
data were automatically coregistered according to the movement of
the robotic stage, and then resampled to equivalent voxel sizes. Co-registered
images were further rendered and visualized using the PMOD software
(PMOD Technologies, Zurich, Switzerland). A 3D-Guassian filter (0.8
mm fwhm) was applied to smooth noise, and the LUTs (look up tables)
were adjusted for good visual contrast. The reconstructed images were
visualized as both orthogonal slices and maximum intensity projections.

Radioactivity Quantification
Radiation sources of a
known amount of radioactivity were imaged and reconstructed using
the same scanning protocol above. A standard curve was generated to
correlate the pixel intensities in reconstructed images with the radioactivity
measured by a γ-counter. Tumor delineation was performed on
CT and SPECT images according to the literature method.− The amount of radioactivity in each tumor was calculated according
to the above-mentioned standard curve. The tumor uptake of 99mTc-P6G-RGD2 was expressed as the percentage of injected
dose per unit volume (%ID/cm3).

Tumor Tissue Immunohistochemistry
The U87MG tumors
were immediately snap-frozen in the OCT (optical cutting temperature)
solution, and were then cut into slices (5 μm). After thorough
drying, slices were fixed with ice-cold acetone for 10 min, and dried
in the air for 20 min. Sections were blocked with 10% goat serum for
30 min, and then were incubated with the hamster anti-integrin β3 antibody (1:100, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and rat anti-CD31
antibody (1:100, BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. After
incubating with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-hamster and fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibodies (1:100, Jackson
ImmunoResearch Inc., West Grove, PA) and washing with PBS, the fluorescence
was visualized with an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Olympus America
Inc., Center Valley, PA). All the pictures were taken under 200×
magnification. Brightness and contrast adjustments were made equally
to all images.
