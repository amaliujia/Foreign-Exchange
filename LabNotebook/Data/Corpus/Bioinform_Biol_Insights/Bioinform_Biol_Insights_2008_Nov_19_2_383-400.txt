Introduction
In 2003 we discovered a new gene, SPRN, which codes for a 151-residue protein (including N- and C-terminal signal sequences) with topographical similarities unique to prion protein (PrP), and which is highly conserved between fish and mammals (for an analysis of the similarities between PrP and Sho see ). We called this new protein Shadoo (Sho; shadow of prion protein). Like PrP, Sho is most abundant in brain (; ; ). Although the functions of Sho are as yet little characterized, it has been shown by gain and loss of function experiments (RNAi and overexpression) to be essential for CNS development in zebrafish (L. Sangiorgio, University of Milan, pers. comm.) and may have a neuroprotective effect similar to PrP (). While PrP is notorious for its association with the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease and Bovine Spongiform Encephelopathy (Mad Cow Disease) it has become clear in recent years that PrP has a range of normal functions, including in neurogenesis and neural plasticity (; ; ; ). In defining the natural functions of Sho we are investigating links of the protein’s properties to those of other proteins, including PrP.

Here we report our finding that Sho has a conserved ‘RGG-box’ motif () defined as a sequence of closely spaced Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats interspersed with other, often aromatic, amino acids. The RGG box proteins are one class of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in various aspects of RNA processing, including splicing, stabilizing, transport and translation of mRNAs (). In addition to being an RNA-binding motif, the RGG box of some proteins is known to mediate interactions with other proteins; for a recent detailed example see .

The capacity to bind RNA constitutes another point of similarity with PrP which is known to bind RNA and DNA (). While it has been established that PrP is competent to bind nucleic acid, it is also known to bind many other ligands including polyanionic glycosaminoglycans (‘GAGs’). Given its propensity to bind polyanions, it is currently unclear whether the binding of nucleic acids is biologically relevant, that is, whether a normal function of PrP involves this type of interaction or whether binding observed experimentally may be a non-specific interaction. However, others have observed that PrP modifies DNA structure in a manner similar to proteins involved in transcriptional regulation () and have queried whether PrP may be involved in the biogenesis or transport of nucleic acid ().

The approach we have used here is underpinned by a novel combination of comparative genomics () and conceptual biology (). By comparing Sho sequences from species ranging from fish to human and integrating these results with those of a comprehensive analysis of published sequence data and experimental findings, we have been able to put our observations into the broader context of RGG-box proteins. This has allowed us to formulate functional hypotheses for Sho.

Materials and Methods
The amino acid sequences of 12 Sho proteins ranging from fish to human were used in this study. Ten of these sequences are available from GenBank [Homo sapiens Np_001012526, Canis lupus familiaris CAJ43798, Bos taurus CAJ43799, Mus musculus NP_898970, Monodelphis domestica CAF43800, Gallus gallus CAJ43796, Xenopus tropicalis CAJ43801, Danio rerio CAD35503, Takifugu rubripes CAG34291, Tetraodon nigroviridis CAG30521]. The sequences for Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus), M. domestica (American opossum), G. gallus (chicken), and X. tropicalis were initially extracted from the genomic databases (N. Chakka, unpublished work of this group). The sequences for X. tropicalis and X. laevis were also verified experimentally (T. Vassilieva and N. Chakka, unpublished work of this group). The sequences were aligned using ClustalW (). Subsequent manual adjustments in the N-terminal region were made to the alignment.

The Swiss-Prot protein database was searched using the program Prosite () http://au.expasy.org/ for known motifs within the Sho sequences. We also searched Swiss-Prot for all proteins that have an RGG-box motif, which we defined as being a sequence of at least 3 RGG repeats with no more than 6 residues between the repeats. This search produced 10 archaeal, 229 bacterial, 14 viral and 1632 eukaryotic sequences, within which there are 607 fungal, 300 plant and 70 human sequences. Examination of the human sequences showed that some well-known RGG-box proteins had not been picked up by this search. The search was then broadened to include proteins with 2 RGG repeats separated by 9, 8, 7, 6 or 5 residues. The results were visually inspected and those proteins with at least one ‘RG’ between the RGG repeats were included in our list. All uncharacterized proteins or redundant sequences were excluded. The remaining human proteins are collected in . We have only recorded the sequence beginning and ending with an RGG repeat. It should be noted that the functional RGG box may extend beyond the sequence denoted in . The RGG sequences were subsequently aligned using ClustalW.

Results and Discussion
Sho—RGG box
A sequence alignment of the N-terminal segment from residue 25 to 42 (the mature protein starts at residue 24) of Shos from different species () reveals a strictly conserved arginine methylation site (GGRGG) () at the beginning of a cluster of RGG repeats. In Shos from human and most other Eutherian mammals there are three RGG repeats, with the first and third separated by 9 residues (RGGARGSARGGVRGG). Thus, the RGG box of human Sho consists of 15 residues: 4 positively charged Arg residues, 7 Gly residues—6 of them dipeptides ‘GG’ which give the sequence a large degree of flexibility–, and 4 small intervening residues. This pattern diverges slightly in other species; the first RGG repeat is conserved but the second and third RGG repeats are truncated to RG in some cases. In summary, although there is some variability in the number of Gly residues in the Sho RGG box, for species from fish to human there is conservation of Lys25 and the following 3 Arg residues which are regularly spaced with 3 intervening residues between each Arg. The increased prevalence of Gly-Gly dipeptides in the higher Eutherian mammals could suggest evolutionary pressure for increased flexibility in this domain.

Comparative analysis of RGG-box proteins—structure and composition
Proteins with an RGG-box motif, as defined for the purpose of this study (Methods), are presented in Supplementary Information . Most (#2–#34) are known to have an RNA-binding function. The subset of proteins highlighted in this paper is presented in . Analysis of all the proteins listed in  reveals that the RGG box is generally found at the end of the protein sequence, particularly at the C-terminus () and is mostly 10–19 residues in length (). We found a slight preference for RGG repeats to be separated by 9 intervening residues (RGG-X9-RGG), as in Sho, but overall the spacing is variable ().

The amino acid composition of the sequences was analysed by calculating the proportion of basic (Arg, Lys and His), acidic (Glu and Asp), aromatic (Phe, Trp and Tyr), polar (Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln and Cys), Gly and the other non-polar amino acids (Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met and Pro) which make up each sequence and then producing a frequency distribution for the entire set of proteins (). As expected, a majority of sequences is Gly rich, with peaks in frequency at 50%–60% Gly composition while basic residues peak at 20%–30%. Although a significant number of sequences do not contain an aromatic acid between the RGG repeats, it is possible that there are aromatic residues in close sequence or spatial proximity to this domain. Very few sequences contain acidic residues.

The Sho RGG sequence conforms to these general structural and compositional parameters. It is found at the end of the protein (N-terminus), is 15 residues long and is comprised of 47% Gly, 27% basic, 20% non-polar and 7% polar residues, and has no acidic or aromatic residues. We aligned the RGG sequence of Sho against other sequences with RGG-X9-RGG spacing in order to identify those most similar to Sho (). Several sequences have 50% or more residues identical to those in the Sho RGG box. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) (#32, ) () and the Herpes Simplex protein ICP27 () bind RNA with their RGG boxes which, like Sho, consist of 2 RGG repeats separated by 9 residues.

Overall, our comparative analysis supports the prediction that the RGG box of Sho is competent to bind RNA.

Sho—predicted arginine methylation and phosphorylation sites
The Arg methylation site in Sho is completely conserved in all species from fish to human, suggesting functional importance. Arginine methylation is a common post-translational modification in RGG-box domains () which affects protein-protein interactions () and RNA binding (). It influences diverse cellular processes, including cellular location of proteins () transcription, processing and transport of mRNAs () and signaling pathways ().

Phosphorylation is another common post-translational modification found in RBPs. Methylation and phosphorylation mechanisms co-regulate a number of RGG-box proteins, possibly including Sho; again for a detailed example see . We identified 3 potential protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites (SAR (34–36 huSho), SLR (63–65 huSho) and SYR (119–121 huSho)) for Sho. One of these, SAR34–36, is within the RGG box and is found in all the Eutherian mammal sequences analysed ( in Supplementary Information). Phosphorylation of Ser34 would have a direct affect on the structure of the RGG box and most likely affect its function. Although the phosphorylation-site motifs are patterns with a high probability of random occurrence it is interesting to note that the presence of at least one phosphorylation site has been experimentally confirmed in 70% of the RGG-box proteins surveyed ( in Supplementary Information). This is a high proportion even taking into account the over-representation of nuclear proteins in the phosphoproteome () and leads us to suggest that phosphorylation is particularly prevalent in RGG-box proteins. The finding of potential methylation and phosphorylation sites in Sho is another point of similarity with other RGG-box proteins. The existence of phosphorylation sites within Sho raises the possibility that Sho may be involved in a signaling pathway that is regulated by phosphorylation.

Functional significance
Sho differs from most of the other proteins surveyed in that it has no other RNA-binding motifs. This is unusual but not unique as hnRNP U (#12; ) has no other RNA-binding motif apart from the RGG box. The RGG box is typically associated with binding to single-stranded nucleic acids, () whereas additional RNA-binding motifs may allow binding of a broader range of RNA targets as is the case for nucleolin (#33, ) (). The inherent flexibility of the RGG box () can also enable binding to several RNA targets, as has been shown for FMRP () which binds to many RNA targets but an affinity for RNA that forms a stable G-quartet structure (; ). As Sho lacks other RNA-binding motifs, we expect it to bind single-stranded nucleic acid, and potentially a range of such targets, as for FMRP.

The RGG box is a positively charged domain known to interact electrostatically with other proteins and anionic molecules. A well-characterized example is the RGG box of the yeast protein Npl3p which docks with the kinase Sky1 (). A non-protein example is provided by the intracellular hyaluronan binding protein (HAPB4) (#21, ) which has high sequence similarity to Sho (). The RGG domain of HAPB4 also constitutes a glycosaminoglycan (‘GAG’) binding motif (R/K–X(7)-R/K) () and has been found to bind strongly and specifically to hyaluronan and weakly to RNA (). Although it is not surprising to find this motif in an Arg-rich sequence (in fact it is present in most of the proteins included in ), it has particular relevance in the case of Sho, given its cellular location.

The cellular location of Sho will determine its opportunities to bind RNA and whether this is its primary function. We originally predicted Sho to be a GPI-anchored protein (). This has now been confirmed in mouse () and for a Sho-like protein (Sho2) (; ) in zebrafish (). However, some GPI-anchored proteins, including PrP, undergo anchor cleavage (‘shedding’), (; ) resulting in formation of soluble proteins which can relocate to other cellular destinations and are capable of performing multiple functions (). While the cell surface is one likely location for Sho, it may be a multifunctional protein found in other cellular locations as well, as for PrP. If Sho sheds its GPI anchor or undergoes proteolytic cleavage before attachment to the cell membrane (), the RGG-box domain would be available for functional roles intracellularly. Other RGG-box proteins are known to have multiple cellular locations, for example, nucleolin and the Ewing Sarcoma (EWS) protein (#26, ) are found on the cell surface as well as in the nucleus and cytoplasm. In fact, there is growing evidence that some RNA-binding proteins have additional roles as cell surface receptors (; ; ) and in signaling pathways as noted for the ras GTPase activating protein binding protein 1 ().

Attached to the cell surface, Sho would be positioned to act as a receptor for ligands found at the cell surface, including nucleic acids, as suggested for EWS (). Sho may, therefore, have a role in cell signaling, similar to PrP which binds the neural cell adhesion molecule and thus participates in the tyrosine kinase fyn signaling pathway leading to neurite outgrowth (). Alternatively, in this location Sho may bind other anionic ligands such as the GAG, hyaluronan, which is known to bind another GPI-anchored protein, brevican, and is involved in the structural plasticity of neural tissue (). It is interesting to note that PrP also binds GAGs including hyaluronan and heparin () and that GAGs may facilitate the conversion of the normal cellular PrP to the isoform found in prion disease ().

If Sho were to shed its GPI anchor and re-enter the cell or if a segment of the N-terminal region incorporating the RGG domain was cleaved off prior to expression at the cell surface, the RGG box would be available to interact with cellular RNA. Indeed, as a small protein of no more than 123 residues, Sho would be capable of diffusing in and out of the nucleus () and shuttling RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This is a function normally performed by RNA-binding proteins involved in neural plasticity, which participate in the biogenesis of mRNA, its transport to dendrites and repression of translation pending appropriate neural stimulation ().

Conclusion
In summary, we have observed that Sho has a conserved RGG-box domain with similar composition to other known RGG-box proteins. We predict that this domain has functional significance and may mediate some of the neural functions already indicated for Sho. Our analysis leads us to postulate that Sho is an RNA-binding protein which may also play a role in cell signaling. Our initial experiments to test the prediction have shown Sho RGG box peptide is competent to bind RNA but further work is required to characterize the interaction.

The discovery of the RGG box in Sho opens new avenues for investigating its function and potential functional overlap with PrP. It is known that PrP plays a role in neural plasticity through its involvement in neural signaling pathways. Here we suggest that Sho may bind mRNA directly and thus play a role in neural plasticity similar to other neural RBPs.

Is a transcriptional activator but this activity can be repressed by RGG box. May be involved in pre-mRNA splicing and transport. Suggested that EWS protein acts as a receptor or binding protein for ligands on cell surface, such as nucleic acids, and thus might mediate extracellular and nuclear events. R/P
