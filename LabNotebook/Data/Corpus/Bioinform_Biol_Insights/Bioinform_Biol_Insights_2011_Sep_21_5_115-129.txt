Introduction
Rhodopseudomonas are rod-shaped, gram-negative, purple nonsulfur, anoxygenic, phototrophic bacteria belonging to the alpha subclass of the Proteobacteria that inhabits diverse natural habitats including soil and wastewater systems., These ubiquitous organisms can grow in both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, and are genetically tractable. Members of the genus are capable of growth using light, inorganic, or organic compounds as energy sources and carbon dioxide or organic compounds as carbon sources.

Rhodopseudomas palustris are metabolically versatile species, with strains that can convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into biomass, produce hydrogen gas,– have multiple metal resistances and fix atmospheric nitrogen. Furthermore, R. palustris strains are also able to degrade a wide range of toxic organic compounds, and may be of use in bioremediation of polluted sites. The finished genome sequences and functional annotation of genes for six R. palustris strains (BisA53, BisB18, BisB5, CGA009, HaA2 and TIE-1) are publicly available,, while the genome sequence of a 7th strain, DX-1, is in production. Strain DX-1 can produce high power densities that allow it to generate bioelectricity from the biodegration of organic and inorganic waste in low-internal-resistance microbial fuel cells. The ability of R. palustris strains to adapt and live under various environmental constraints as well as biodegrade pollutants to be used as biofuel, make them a model system for research on renewable energy from biological sources.

The assignment of functions to predicted genes from sequenced genomes is an approach to identify biological pathways that encode desirable phenotypes for diverse applications. A search of the Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system (version 3.3) for genomes annotated with the hydrogen production phenotype revealed that six R. palustris strains (BisA53, BisB18, BisB5, CGA009, DX-1 and HaA2) were annotated with relevance for hydrogen production. Additionally, strain TIE-1 was annotated as an iron oxidizer. A strain of R. palustris is able to intracellularly synthesize cadmium sulfide nanoparticles and then secrete from cells. The availability of the finished genome sequences of six R. palustris strains combined with online bioinformatics software for integrated analysis presents new opportunities to elucidate the genomic basis of metabolic versatility and ecological lifestyles of the bacteria species. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the functional annotations available for multiple R. palustris genomes to identify annotations that could be further investigated as strain-specific or uniquely shared phenotypic characteristics.

The genome statistics, functional relatedness and functional annotations of the six R. palustris genomes were extracted or predicted using tools available on the IMG resource. Specifically, Pfam abundance data were extracted and encoded as a 6-digit binary accession to facilitate comparative analysis including strain-specific (annotation for only one genome) and uniquely shared annotations (annotation for only two genomes) for the genomes compared. We refer collectively to these bioinformatics analyses as functional annotation analytics since they can be accomplished within the IMG resource. The analytics process among others identified uniquely shared annotations for cell membrane water/glycerol transporter in strains BisB5 and CGA009. The observation orthologous aquaporins in R. palustris was of interest because of our ongoing and published research on aquaporins.– Homology modeling predicted that the orthologous aquaporins in BisB5 and CGA009 are water-specific transporters.

Microbial aquaporins are known to function in freeze tolerance while loss of aquaporins is advantageous for utilization of high-sugar substrates. Investigation into the presence or absence of aquaporin in R. palustris strains could provide molecular basis for nitrogen fixation at low temperatures, a process affected by availability of liquid water, as well as the efficient utilization of high-sugar substrates in biohydrogen production.

Methods
Genome statistics
The complete genome sequences of six Rhodopseudomonas palustris strains (HaA2, NCBI Taxon ID 316058; BisA53, Taxon ID 316055; BisB18, NCBI Taxon ID 316056; BisB5, NCBI Taxon ID 316057; CGA009, NCBI Taxon ID 258594, TIE-1, NCBI Taxon ID 395960) are available in the public genome databases., The statistics of selected genome features were obtained for each of the R. palustris genomes and were retrieved from the Organism Details page on the Integrated Microbial Genomes website (version 3.3, February 2011). The Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system is a data management, analysis and annotation platform for all publicly available genomes.  The statistics were then integrated to allow for comparative analysis of the DNA sequence (number of bases and guanine-cytosine content) and various functional classifications (the total genes predicted per genome and the proportion of the total genes annotated).

Functional relatedness of genomes based on Pfam domains
Functional relatedness of genomes is a measure of similarity between two genomes based on the similarity of the functional annotation of genes. The relationship between the six R. palustris genomes and Pfam domain annotation of genes were determined using the Genome Clustering Tool on the IMG system. This bioinformatics tool enables the use of the hierarchical clustering method to group genomes.

Genomes were also compared for the presence or absence of Pfam domain annotations to determine annotations that are specific to one or two of the six completely sequenced strains of R. palustris. The Abundance Profile Toolkit on the IMG system was used to generate and view the Pfam annotation abundance matrix for Pfam domains with at least one gene annotation. The resulting matrix was processed using customized PERL and UNIX scripts to generate a 6-digit binary accession for each Pfam domain. Digit 1 through 6 of the binary accession corresponds to BisA53, BisB18, BisB5, CGA009, HaA2 and TIE-1. Thus a Pfam domain with binary accession ‘100000’ indicated that the category was found only in genome of strain BisA53. To facilitate searching for user-defined combinations, we constructed a visual analytic view using Tableau Public (www.tableausoftware.com/public), a free data visualization software.

The availability of a matrix consisting of binary accessions for multiple Pfam domains allowed the clustering of R. palustris genomes based on total number of genomes annotated by a Pfam domain. Following similar approaches by Huang et al of hierarchical clustering analysis, the binary patterns were clustered using Cluster 3.0 with “Pfam domains” and “Genomes” as axes. The similarity matrix used was produced via the correlation (uncentered) method, and an average linkage clustering was performed. The figure generated by Cluster 3.0 was visualized in Java TreeView 1.1.5.r2.

Gene orthology, sequence analysis and comparative protein structure modeling
Genes of interest with strain-specific or uniquely shared annotations were further analyzed for (i) gene orthology: genes in different genomes that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation (ii) sequence analysis: multiple sequence alignment of protein sequences of uniquely shared; and (iii) comparative protein structure modeling: inferring protein structure using a known template to understand structure-function relationship of strain-specific protein or uniquely shared proteins.

In the IMG system, orthologs are defined as bidirectional best hits from BLASTP comparisons and can be retrieved using the Gene Homolog Tool. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW. Theoretical homology models of protein of interest were generated using MODELLER7V7 using a high resolution X-ray crystal structure of a homolog of the protein as template. The models were relaxed using a quick minimization routine with Amber force field and molecular surfaces were generated using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) (Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). Graphics were generated using University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Chimera Molecular Visualization package.

Results
Genome statistics
The counts of DNA bases as well as selected annotations applied to assign functions to the six strains are presented in . The total number of bases sequenced for the R. palustris strains ranged from 4892717 (BisB5) to 5744041 (TIE-1) bases. The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of the genomes ranged from 64.44% (BisA53) to 66.04% (HaA2). The order of increasing genome size observed was BisB5, HaA2, CGA009, BisA53, BisB18 and TIE-1. The total number of genes also followed the order of genome size. Strain CGA009 had the highest coverage in four of the eight annotation schemes. Among the functional annotations methods applied to the protein coding genes, the Pfam had the highest coverage for all the genomes.

Pfam domain annotation statistics
In the abundance profile of the IMG system, a total of 2,355 Pfam domains were used to annotate at least one gene among the six finished R. palustris genomes analyzed. Further, 57 binary patterns of the possible 64 (2) patterns were used to label each Pfam domain with 1,641 domains present in all the genomes (ie, Pfam domains with binary pattern ‘111111’) (). The total Pfam annotations for CGA009, BisA53, TIE-1, BisB5, BisB18 and HaA2 were 1955, 1961, 2005, 1886, 1986, and 1944 respectively. A total of 245 Pfam domains were strain-specific annotations for the genomes compared (). Strain BisB18 had a total of 65 unique Pfam domain annotations; the highest among the strains analyzed. A total of 132 Pfam domains were uniquely shared by two strains. Further, 31 uniquely shared annotations that included CGA009 when the six genomes were compared. We prioritized Pfam domains shared by CGA009 and BisB5, Bis18 and HaA2 by verifying in the IMG system if they were used to annotate genes in the draft genome of strain DX-1.

Pfam domains shared exclusively with CGA009 are presented in . The numbers of Pfam domains shared by 3, 4 and 5 R. palustris genomes were 98, 107, and 132 respectively. The seven binary patterns of Pfam domains that were not observed in the matrix are 000000; 001110 (shared by only BisB5, CGA009 and HaA2), 010110 (shared by only BisB18, CGA009 and HaA2); 011001 (shared by only BisB18, BisB5 and TIE-1); 011100 (shared by only BisB18, BisB5 and CGA009); 100100 (shared by only BisA53 and CGA009); and 101100 (shared by only BisA53, BisB18 and CGA009).

A visual analytics interactive view of binary patterns encoding the availability of the Pfam annotation for six R. palutris strains was also developed (). This interactive visualization resource enables user to specify the binary patterns () to retrieve the Pfam domains clusters with the pattern.  is an example of output of search for uniquely shared Pfam annotations for CGA009 and BisB5. The website for the resource is http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/pfam2rpalustris/pfamviz.

Functional relatedness of genomes based on Pfam domains
The overall functional relatedness of the six R. palustris genomes using hierarchical clustering based on the Pfam domains is presented in . Two major groups were observed: genomes BisA53 and BisB18 clustered together while genomes BisB5, CGA009, TIE-1 and HaA2 clustered together with BisB5 on a distinct branch. CGA009 and TIE-1 clustered on the same node.

Pfam domains were grouped into six groups based on the number of genomes with the annotation. Clusters of Pfam domains by binary patterns for each of the group were determined using hierarchical clustering (). Again, in all the clustering CGA009 and TIE-1 clustered together. The number of clusters observed for Pfam in 2, 3, 4 and 5 genomes were 14 (), 15 (), 15 () and 6 () respectively.

Functional categories of strain-specific Pfam domain annotations
The annotations in the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COGs) of Proteins system are classified into functional categories that allow for inferences on biological processes. The IMG system has 25 functional categories for Pfam domains based on the COG categories (http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/pub/main.cgi?section=FindFunctions&amp;page=pfamCategories). Therefore, we decided to extract deeper functional information on strain-specific Pfam domains for the six genomes. In this investigation, Pfam domains that have not been mapped to functional categories were categorized as “Unmapped”.

The 245 strain-specific Pfam domains among the genomes compared () were mapped to four first level and 25 second level functional categories ( and ). The first level categories were: Information Processing and Storage; Cellular Processes and Signaling; Metabolism and Poorly Characterized. A list of mappings of Pfam domains to functional categories is found in the . A Pfam domain can map to multiple categories. At least 40% of the Pfam domains for each of the strain were unmapped (). Strain CGA009 had the least number of unique Pfam domain annotations (9) and their second-level functional categories were as follows: BsuBI_PstI_RE (BsuBI/PstI restriction endonuclease C-terminus, PF06616, Unmapped); DUF2081 (Uncharacterized conserved protein, PF09854, Unmapped); DUF2806 (Domain of unknown function, PF10987, Unmapped); DUF364 (Domain of unknown function, PF04016, Function unknown), HTH_7 (Helix-turn-helix domain of resolvase, PF02796, Unmapped), LCM (Leucine carboxyl methyltransferase, PF04072, Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism) Nudix_N (Hydrolase of X-linked nucleoside diphosphate N terminal, PF12535, Unmapped), RepB (RepB plasmid partitioning protein, PF07506, Transcription) and RNA_pol (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, PF00940, Transcription).

These mappings also helped to identify (i) functional categories that are unique to a genome in the comparison genome set; and (ii) identify strains in which Pfam domains were mapped to multiple functional categories ( and ). Strain TIE-1 had the only entry “Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis [J]” with unique Pfam domain (PF05746, DALR_1) being an all alpha helical domain is the anticodon binding domain in Arginyl and glycyl tRNA synthetase. Strain BisB18 is unique for the “Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis” category with two Pfam domains: PF06629 (MltA-interacting protein MipA) and PF05045 (Rhamnan synthesis protein F RgpF). Strain BisA53 is unique for “Cell motility [N]” category with one Pfam domain: PF03975 (Chemotactic sensory transduction CheD). Strain HaA2 is unique for the “Extracellular structures [W]” and “Intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport [U]” categories. One Pfam domain: PF03895 (YadA-like C-terminal region YadA) was mapped to both categories. Strain BisB5 is unique for “Posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones [O]” with two domains: PF01431 (Peptidase family M13 Peptidase_M13) and PF05649 (Peptidase family M13 Peptidase_M13_N).

A web resource that enables selection of functional annotation categories for the strain-specific Pfam domains is available at http://public.tableausoftware.com/views/rhodo_palustris/uniquepfam2strain.

We were particularly interested in gene products annotated as containing protein domain for water and/or glycerol transport (PF00230) that was observed only in CGA009 and BisB5. Therefore, additional bioinformatics analyses were performed in the IMG system to verify strain-specific or uniquely shared annotations. A search using the IMG Function Tool in the six completely sequenced R. palustris genomes for genes annotated with the Pfam domain PF00230 (water/glycerol transport) retrieved 3 genes from genomes of 2 strains (RPA2485 from CGA009 and RPD_2467 and RPD_2519 from BisB5).

Gene orthology, sequence analysis and homology modeling of Rhodopseudomonas water/glycerol transporters
Orthologous proteins RPA2485 and RPD_2467 from strains CGA009 and BisB5 had a sequence length of 240 aa, The alignment of their sequences with the sequence of aquaporin of Agrobacterium tumerfaciens str. C58 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession 3LLQ) is presented in . Both R. palustris aquaporin (AQP) sequences have two conserved Asparagine-Proline-Alanine (NPA) motifs that is characteristic motif of aquaporin sequences. These motifs align with those found in the 3LLQ. In the two R. palustris aquaporin sequences, prediction of membrane protein topology using Topcons confirmed six transmembrane domains in the following residue positions: 10–30, 35–55, 83–103, 131–151, 162–182, 206–226 () connected by 5 loops (Loop A to Loop E according to the nomenclature in Kruse et al). Furthermore, the first NPA motif (residues 64–66) is inside loop (Loop B) while the second NPA motif (residues 186–188) is located outside loop (Loop E).

RPD_2519 from strain BisB5 had a 95 aa predicted protein that lacked ortholog in any other genomes according to predictions in Integrated Microbial Genome system. Further, RPD_2519 had only one NPA motif and thus does not fit the typical definition of aquaporins, which have two NPA or NPA-like motifs to form the water/solute channel. Therefore, we did not continue to investigate the sequence.

Theoretical homology models of aquaporins of strains BisB5 and CGA009 of R. palustris were generated using MODELLER7V7 with the high resolution X-ray crystal structure of aquaporin from the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumerfaciens str. C58 (PDB ID: 3LLQ) as the template. The percent identities of the modeled AQP from BisB5 and CGA009 with the template were 67.6% and 66.7% respectively. The final homology model was aligned with the widely studied human AQP1 crystal structure (1J4N) and to compare residue interactions, pore dynamics and the overall structure-function relationship with the reported structures of 34 AQP channels (PDB ID: 1H6I, 1IH5, 1LDA, 1LDF, 1LDI, 1RC2, 1YMG, 1Z98, 2ABM, 2B5F, 2B6O, 2B6P, 2C32, 2D57, 2EVU, 2F2B, 2O9D, 2O9E, 2O9F, 2O9G, 2W1P, 2W2E, 2ZZ9, 3CLL, 3CN5, 3CN6, 3D9S, 3GD8, 3IYZ, 3LLQ, 3NE2, 3NK5, 3NKA, 3NKC). In addition to the presence of the characteristic NPA motifs, a narrow constriction region called aromatic/arginine (ar/R) approximately 8 Amstrongs above the NPA site. The shape of ar/R constriction region determines channel transport selectivity.,

Discussion
Rhodospeudomonas palustris, a nonsulphur purple photosynthetic bacteria, has been extensively investigated for its metabolic versatility including ability to produce hydrogen gas from sunlight and biomass as well as production of nanoparticles.,, Therefore, the discovery of new knowledge on strain-specific adaptation or phenotypes can advance their use in industrial processes. The identification of unique and shared annotations from closely related bacteria species is a useful step to unraveling unique and shared biological processes that define their ability to survive. Further, functional annotation analytics relying on bioinformatics tools integrated in a microbial genome informatics resource can provide insights into the origin of novel functions encoded in microbial genomes.,–

We have compared the genomes of six strains of R. palustris based on the Pfam domain functional annotations. These strains have been described as ecotypes or genomospecies, which indicates their heterogeneous genetic structure. Our analysis revealed strain-specific and uniquely shared protein family annotations of genes among the six strains that could be further investigated. Gene loss or gain can explain the presence of strain-specific or uniquely shared genes., In addition, we identified a set of 1,641 Pfam domain annotations common to all genomes. The classification of Pfam domains into strain-specific, uniquely shared or common to all genomes is dependent upon the number of strains compared. Thus, the inclusion of strain DX-1 in the analysis will generate a new set of profiles. We have not included DX-1 in the analysis since only a draft genome sequence is available and not yet published. Nonetheless, in the case of Pfam domain annotation for water/glycerol transport, inclusion of DX-1 confirmed that the annotation is present in only genomes for strains BisB5 and CGA009. Our bioinformatics algorithm can be adapted to include additional genomes as needed for comparative analysis of Pfam domain annotations.

The integrative bioinformatics tools on Integrated Microbial Genome (IMG) system allowed for a comparison of the functional annotations of encoded proteins in R. palustris genomes based on COG clusters, Pfam, TIGRfam, and InterPro. We choose to further explore Pfam functional annotations for the selected annotation groups because the annotation method had the highest annotation coverage for the six genomes when compared to TIGRFAM and COG annotation schema (). In addition, the Pfam database is a large collection of 12,273 families (as of March 2011, Release 25) and commonly used for functional annotation of genomic data. An innovation of our investigation is the inclusion of an interactive visualization of the binary accessions associated with 2,355 Pfam domain annotations for six R. palustris genomes.

The use of visual analytics software to allow human interaction with dataset is increasingly recognized as relevant to gaining novel insights into biological datasets beyond purely biostatistical approaches.– The binary-based integration provides rapid snapshots of the dataset that can facilitate deeper biological insights or relationships between the datasets to direct further analysis., The visual analytics web-based resources accompanying this report allows for user-defined queries beyond those reported here. The data visualizations could also yield novel insights on the functional annotations associated with the six strains. In this investigation, we have illustrated the use of these visual analytics resources to identify annotations shared by BisB5 and CGA009 (). In addition, a static visualization of the functional categories of the 245 strain-specific Pfam domains is presented in . An interactive version of  is available as a web resource.

Previous studies conducted by Oda et al revealed that Rhodopseudomonas populations isolated from sediment microenvironments contain unique genes that promote distinct physiological characteristics conducive for environmental adaptation. In addition, strain-specific adaptations that allow anaerobic fermentation, expanded biodegradation, or expanded light-harvesting capabilities are also potentially useful in applications for biohydrogen production by Rhodopseudomonas. We also used hierarchical clustering to define Pfam domain clusters using the number of annotated genomes (). Strains CGA009 and TIE-1 always clustered together in line with previous observations that the genomes of TIE-1 and CGA009 are 97.9% identical at the nucleotide level over 5.28 Mb of shared DNA. Further, strains BisA53 and BisB18 clustered together in our analysis consistent with them having similar genome architecture. The genome clusters observed in this investigation is consistent with phylogenetic trees constructed using 3 molecular marker sequences from 33 Rhodopseudomonas strains.

Comparison of the Pfam domain annotations revealed that proteins annotated with PF00230 (major intrinsic proteins) were restricted to strain CGA009 and BisB5. Protein sequences annotated PF00230 belong to a universal family of cellular water/solute channels. In terms of function, members are classified into orthodox aquaporins (AQP) (water-specific channels) and aquaglyceroporins (permeated by mainly glycerol and some other solutes, whereas water transport is strongly limited)., Generally, permeation is strictly passive according to the osmotic or solute gradient. Orthodox aquaporins function in water homeostasis while aquaglyceroporins function in metabolism.

Our homology modeling and sequence analysis of the two 240 aa R. palustris proteins from strains BisB5 and CGA009 that were annotated with PF00230 annotation indicate they may function as water-specific channel (). The transport specificity in water-specific AQP channels have been clearly demonstrated by using mutational studies of three aromatic/Arginine (ar/R) constriction region residues F56, H180 and R195 rat AQP1. Single or double mutants of ar/R residues to amino acids with small amino acid residues alanine or valine did not alter water permeability. However, the double mutants H180A/R195V allowed transport of larger molecules including glycerol and urea indicating a clear ar/R pore constriction versus transport relationship.  The corresponding ar/R region in the aquaporins from R. palustris is occupied by F44, H174, T183 and R189 () indicating the similar selectivity towards water molecules.,,

Aquaporins have function beyond water/glycerol transport including cell adhesion, cell migration and transport of molecules such as arsenic and boron. The lack of genuine aquaporins in most microorganisms has led to the conclusion that aquaporins are not essential for basic cellular function in microorganisms. However, they could be advantageous for improving freeze tolerance in natural conditions of rapid freezing of microbes and insect larvae. Strains or genes of R. palustris have been isolated or cloned from cold soil environments including the high arctic and the sub-Antarctic in the context of nitrogen fixation, a process in which access to liquid water is a more limiting factor for continued activation of nitrogenase in low temperature. CGA009, a strain widely distributed in temperate soil and water, is well equipped for nitrogen fixation as it encodes three nitrogenases. The absence of aquaporins in strains BisA53, BisB18, HaA2 and TIE-1 may also have functional relevance. In natural Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, the loss of aquaporins provides a major fitness advantage on high-sugar substrates such as fruits or fermentations common to many S. cerevisiae strains’ natural niche. Strains P4, PBUM001, M23, WP3-5, and W004 of R. palustris have been employed to produce hydrogen gas directly by fermenting sugars or improving the hydrogen gas production yield.– Specifically, strain WP3-5 improved hydrogen gas production from cassava starch by using soluble metabolite products (eg, acetic acid, butyric acid) from dark fermentation. Research to determine the presence or absence of aquaporin in R. palustris strains of known phenotype could provide molecular basis for nitrogen fixation at low temperatures as well as efficient utilization of substrates with high sugar content.

Conclusions
Functional annotation analytics of six genomes of Rhodopseudomonas palustris revealed sets of annotations that could be verified as strain-specific or uniquely shared phenotypes. Genes encoding water/glycerol transport were present in genome sequences of strains CGA009 and BisB5 but absent in strains BisA53, BisB18, HaA2 and TIE-1. Based on observations in other microbes, the presence of aquaporin in R. palustris strains may improve freeze tolerance in natural conditions of rapid freezing such as nitrogen fixation at low temperatures where access to liquid water is a limiting factor for nitrogenase activation. In the case of adaptive loss of aquaporin genes, strains may be better adapted to survive in conditions of high sugar content such as fermentation of biomass for biohydrogen production. Finally, web-based resources were developed to allow for interactive, user-defined selection of the relationship between protein family annotation and the R. palustris genomes.

Visual analytics resource for functional annotation analytics of six Rhodopseudomonas palustris genomes. The view illustrates selection of options to display on Pfam categories present in only strains BisB5 and CGA009. Five Pfam categories were identified including PF00230 (MIP—Major Intrinsic Protein family) the domain for water and/or glycerol transport. To achieve this view, the filters for only strains BisB5 and CGA009 were set to 1 equivalent to the 6-digit binary accession 001100. The position of the digit corresponds to the column number for each strain. Thus, the annotation of BisB5 and CGA009 are represented by digits 3 and 4 in the binary accession.
