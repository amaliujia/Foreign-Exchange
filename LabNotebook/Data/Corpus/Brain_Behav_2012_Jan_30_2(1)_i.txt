Brain and Behavior will give rapid consideration to papers in all areas of clinical and basic research. Molecular, cellular, systems and population-level research in humans and animal models are welcome. The journal will consider empirical and theoretical submissions in areas including but not limited to mechanisms and treatment of all neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders, behavioral and cognitive science, neuronal and glial cell biology, neurosurgery, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, neuroimmunology, neuropathology, computational neuroscience, functional and structural neuroimaging, neurogenetics and psychiatric genetics, child and adolescent psychiatry, psychiatry of affective and cognitive disorders, epidemiology, emerging technologies and new research methods, translational research, neuropsychology, clinical psychology, and developmental, cognitive, and social psychology.

Brain and Behavior features original research articles, reviews, methods papers, editorials, and commentaries. Original research papers must report well-conducted research with conclusions supported by the data presented in the paper.

Brain and Behavior publishes papers submitted directly to the journal and those referred from a select group of prestigious journals published by Wiley-Blackwell. Brain and Behavior is a Wiley Open Access journal, one of a new series of peer-reviewed titles publishing quality research with speed and efficiency.
