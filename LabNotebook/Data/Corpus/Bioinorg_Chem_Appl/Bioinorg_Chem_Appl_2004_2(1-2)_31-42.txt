ABSTRACT
A number of nucleoside mono- and diphosphites and phosphonates containing 1,2-dicarbadodecaborane
(12) (la-6b) at 5'-position of the sugar moiety have been synthesized in good yields. Experimental details
along with the spectroscopic and analytical data, supporting the formation of the title compounds, are
presented. These constitute a new generation of boron compounds that are envisioned to be useful in cancer
treatment via Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT).
INTRODUCTION
The concept of BNCT was first proposed by Locher some sixty years ago/l/. However, the successful
application of BNCT for the treatment of cancer still presents a challenge in medical research. Over the last
decade or so, various boron-containing analogues of biologically active compounds such as amino acids/2/,
peptides/3/, porphyrins/4/, polyamines/5/, nucleosides, as well as DNA binders/6/, have been synthesized
and evaluated for their possible use in BNCT. Such analogues might function in a manner similar to their
naturally occurring counterparts and become selectively incorporated into either proliferating or more
metabolically active tumor cells. The requirement of 25-30/zg of B atoms per gram of tumor for effective
BNCT/7/has led researchers to incorporate 1, 2-dicarbadodecaborane (o-carborane) as the integral part of
many cancer drugs/8/. The C2B10 carborane cage has unique electronic and steric properties that also make it
an intriguing moiety in drug design/9/. Boron containing nucleosides are potentially attractive because they
should be (1) taken up selectively into tumor due to high mitotic rate of tumor cells vs. normal cells, (2)
intra-cellularly converted to the corresponding nucleotides by phosphorylation, and (3) incorporated into
tumor DNA, thereby enhancing the cytotoxicity of neutron capture therapy/10/. Early work focused on the
development and synthesis of boron-containing purine and pyrimidine bases in which the boron atom was
placed within the purine or pyrimidine nucleus and flanked by two nitrogen atoms /1 l/. Several boron
containing nucleosides have also been synthesized with a borane, cyanoborane, dihydroxylboryl, and

carboranyl unit attached to a nucleic acid base/12/. Nonetheless, an ideal BNCT drug should exhibit the
hydrolytic stability of the P-Ccage)-nucleotide linkages under physiological conditions without substantial
cytotoxicity to the normal cells. Therefore, construction of such linkages is warranted. Consequently, our
preliminary results indicated that several prototype carboranyl-substituted adenosine diphosphate (ADP) can
be synthesized and their chemistry explored/13/. Thus, this work led us to explore similar species containing
carborane cages at 5'-position of the sugar moiety with the hope of serving a dual purpose in providing a
significant boron concentration as well as mimicing the naturally occurring nucleosides in the living system
/2,3/12/. Here we report the syntheses and characterization of novel carboranyl derivatives of nucleoside
mono- and diphosphites and phosphonates.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
All solvents, chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification unless
otherwise noted. Baker analyzed silica gel (60-200 mesh) was used for flash column chromatography. 1,2-
Bis(chlorophenylphosphino)-1,2-dicarbadodecaborane (I), 1-phenyl-2-(chlorophenylphosphino)-1,2-dicarba-
dodecaborane (2), l-methyl-2-(chlorophenylphosphino)-l,2-dicarbadodecaborane (3) were prepared by the
methods described elsewhere/14/. 1,2-Bis(chioromethylphosphate)-l,2-dicarbadodecaborane (4), l-phenyl-
2-(chloromethylphosphate)-1,2-dicarbadodecaborane (5), I-methyl-2-(chloromethylphosphate)-l,2-dicarba-
dodecaborane (6) were synthesized by the. methods described in the literature/15/. Closo-l,2-C2BoH2 (o-
carborane), closo-l-Ph-l,2-C2BoHl (phenyl-o-carborane), and closo-l-Me-l,2-C2BoH (methyl-o-
carborane) were obtained from KATCHEM and used as received. N6-3'-O-dibenzoyl-2'-deoxyadenosine, N2-
isobutyryl-3'-acetyl-2'-deoxyguanosine, phenyl dichlorophosphine and methyl dichlorophosphate were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF), triethylamine
(TEA) were dried over sodium metal and benzophenone and doubly distilled before use.
Spectroscopic and analytical procedures
The tH, B, 3tp and t3C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Fourier-transform multinuclear NMR
spectrometer at 200, 64.2, 80.2 and 50.3 MHz, respectively. Infrared spectra were recorded using a Nicolet
Magna 550 FT-IR spectrophotometer with OMNIC software. Elemental analyses were obtained in house
using a Perkin Elmer 2400 CHN elemental analyzer.
Synthetic procedures
All experiments were carried out in 100 mL Pyrex glass round-bottom flasks of each fitted with a
nitrogen inlet and containing a magnetic stirring bar. All known compounds among the products were
identified by comparing their IR and NMR spectra and melting points with those of authentic samples.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We recently reported the synthesis of carboranyl bis(adenosine diphosphate) (CBADP) in which
diphosphorylated adenosine base was attached to both the carbons of the carborane cage. The specific
synthetic route involved the reaction of 1,2-bis(methyl dichlorophosphate)-1,2-dicarbadodecaborane with 5'-
methoxy monophosphorylated-3'-O-and N6-protected deoxyadenosine /13/. However, the present work
involves the syntheses of a number of carboranyl nucleosides in which the phosphino or phosphate
substituted bases are attached either to one carbon or both the carbons of the carborane cage, instead of the
diphosphorylated bases. In addition, the present work has been performed with two bases (adenosine and
guanosine). The synthetic route has been simplified by one step reaction involving the
chlorophenylphosphino-substituted and chioromethylphosphate-substituted carboranes with adenosine or
guanosine to yield the desired species, la-6b as shown in Schemes I-2.
1,2-Bis[phenylphosphinodeoxynucleoside]-l,2-dicarbadodecaborane, la-b, and l-phenyl or methyl-2-
[phenylphosphinodeoxynucleoside]-l,2-dicarbadodecaborane, 2a-b or 3a-b, were obtained in moderate
yields (56-62 %) from the reaction of 3'-0- and N6-protected deoxyadenosine, or from similarly protected
deoxyguanosine, with the disubstituted (phenylchlorophosphine)carborane or the monosubstituted
(phenylchlorophosphine)methyl- or phenyl carborane with triethylamine in THF. Protection of the base
nitrogens in deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine was also important to prevent boronation at the base
positions. All of the carboranyl derivatives of mono- and diphosphites and phosphonates have been
characterized by their elemental analyses, NMR spectra and IR spectra. The 31p NMR resonance was
observed between 7.00-8.25 ppm as a broad singlet, presumably due to a long-range coupling of the
phosphorus with the boron atoms ofthe cage. it is of interest to note that the 3p chemical shifts for a number
of closo-o-carboranylphosphines appear in the range of 5.4 ppm to 54.2 ppm depending on the substituent on
the phosphorus atom/16/. On the other hand, the B NMR chemical shifts of closo-o-carboranylphosphines
appear in the range of-! ppm to -13 ppm/16/, and are almost similar to those of la 3b whose B NMR
chemical shifts appeared in the range of-2.00 to-16.00 ppm indicating the presence of similar cage
functionality on the cage carbons in these compounds. The IR spectra of la 3b exhibited the characteristic
B-H stretching absorptions in the region of 2560-2583 cm that indicates the presence of carborane cages in
these species. The C NMR spectra, in addition to the resonances due to alkyl and/or aromatic functionalities
in the expected region of chemical shifts, showed peaks in the region of 6 70.0 86.0 ppm due to cage
carbons of the closo-o-carborane unit and are quite close to the values of 65. 84.5 ppm observed for

closo-o-carboranylphosphines/l 6/. The proton NMR spectra were consistent with all of the moieties present
in a -3b.
The compounds 1,2-bis[methylphosphatedeoxynucleoside]-l,2-dicarbadodeca-borane, 4a-b, and l-phenyl
or methyl-2-[methylphosphatedeoxy-nucleoside]-l,2-dicarbadodecaborane, 5a-b or 6a-b, were obtained in
50-58 % yield from the reaction of the appropriate deoxynucleoside and the disubstituted
(chloromethylphosphate), or the mono-substituted (chloromethylphosphate) carborane. The deprotection of
the protecting groups on the bases in the final compounds was not tried. All ofthe products shown in Scheme
2 have been characterized by elemental analyses, H, B, 3C and P NMR spectra and IR spectra (see
Experimental section). The chemical shift values of 6 8.25 ppm in the 3P NMR spectra, 6 -2.61 to-
16.38 ppm in the B NMR spectra, and 6 71.0 83.6 ppm in the C NMR spectra, in addition to those in
the H NMR spectra, are all in the range observed for the recently reported carboranyl bis(adenosine
diphosphate) /13/ indicating the presence of similar linkages that exist between the exo-polyhedral moieties
and the closo-o-carboranyl cage in 4a-b, 5a-b and 6a-b. The IR spectra showed the characteristic B-H
stretching frequencies in the region of 2565-2580 cm-. Nonetheless, the utility of these compounds as a
tumor-targeting species for effective boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) or in photodynamic therapy
(PDT) will be investigated in the near future. Since all of the reaction sequences, described in Schemes 1-2,
are of a general nature, they represent a blueprint for the synthesis of a family of potentially valuable
hydrolytically stable carborane nucleic acid constructs. Studies evaluating the in-vitro and in-vivo localizing
ability of these novel compounds are currently being carried out in our laboratories.
