INTRODUCTION
The coumarins constitute an important class of compounds, with several types
of pharmacological agents possessing anticancer, anti-HIV,
anticoagulant, and spasmolytic and antibacterial activity among
others. Of the many actions of coumarins, antioxidant and
antiproliferative effects stand out. A large number of
structurally novel coumarin derivatives has ultimately been
reported to show substantial cytotoxic activity in vitro and in
vivo.

Subsequent analysis of scientific literature revealed
numerous reports on the antiproliferative and antitumor activities
of a variety of coumarin compounds, for example, both coumarin
itself and 7-hydroxycoumarin have been reported to inhibit the
proliferation of a number of human malignant cell lines in vitro
[–] and have demonstrated activity against several
types of animal tumors [–]. These compounds have also
been reported in clinical trials to demonstrate activity against
prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, and metastatic renal cell
carcinoma [–].

For coumarins, generally the in vitro structure-activity
relationship studies have shown that cytotoxicity is found with
derivatives containing ortho-dihydroxy substituents. Also, the
chemical-structure/biological activity study of the coumarins
showed that the addition of a cathecolic group to the basic
structure induces increased cytotoxic activity in tumor cell
lines []. The different cytotoxic values found for the
coumarins could be related to the presence and the positions of the
hydroxyls in their structures.

The complexes of rare earth ions have aroused much interest.
Lanthanides are a subject of increasing interest in bioinorganic
and coordination chemistry [, ].

Nowadays, a lot of studies report complexes of
coumarin derivatives with rare earth metals, which possess
biological activity. Thus, lanthanide complexes of
3-sulfo-4-hydroxycoumarin [] and
bis(4-hydroxy-3-coumarinyl)-acetic acid [] have been
synthesized and characterized. The complexes have revealed good
anticoagulant action.

Lanthanides manifest an antitumor activity.
Furthermore, literature data show that the coumarins have also these properties. These previous data from literature
are in
 accordance with our investigations. They give us a reason to suppose that complexes of
coumarins with lanthanum could present interesting metalorganic
compounds with antitumor activity. As a result from our earlier
work, the cytotoxic profile of some complexes of mendiaxon,
warfarin, coumachlor, and niffcoumar with lanthanides against
P3HR1, K-562, and THP-1 cell lines was proved
[–]. With the relatively resistant CML-derived erythroleukemic K-562 cell line, we obtained very interesting in vitro results. It is noteworthy that the lanthanide
complexes with niffcoumar have pronounced cytotoxic
effects. They have strong cell proliferation inhibiting effects
(only about 30% of the cells were survival). This means that the
resistant tumor cells may be inhibited significantly with
lanthanide complexes. This means also that the spectrum of
cytotoxicity of these complexes is different from cis-DDP(II) and
from Pt(II) complexes. These results are of some interest as a
possibility to influence resistant tumors. The corresponding
lanthanide salts are found to be of very low or missing activity.
So far, we can conclude that the structure metal-ligand determines
the antitumor spectrum of the new complexes. Those in vitro
effects are not so clearly expressed as it is in the case of
cis-DDP(II). Nevertheless their studying is interesting in
connection with other cell lines and tumors in order to find out
the differences in their spectrum of activity.

Little is known about the complexing ability of lanthanum(III)
with coumarins. A survey of the literature reveals that no work
has been done on the reactions of lanthanum(III) with
H2L1 and its derivatives. It was, therefore, considered
worthwhile to study the complexation, and in the first place, the
objective of this study was to determine whether the new
complexes were active as cytotoxic agents.

In the present study, we perform investigation of the coordination
ability of H2L1 and H2L2 in complexation
reaction with lanthanum(III). The obtained La(III)
complexes with these coumarin ligands were characterized by
elemental analysis, physicochemical methods, and mass-, NMR-, and
IR-spectroscopy. The complicated vibrational spectra of
lanthanum(III) complexes were interpreted on the basis of
comparison with the vibrational spectra of the free ligands. The
most sensitive to coordination modes of the ligands have been
assigned and discussed.

We observed that La(III) possesses  a cytotoxic activity, and
literature data show that the coumarins have also these
properties. That is why our synthesis of complexes of
La(III) is taken into consideration with cytotoxic
screening and further pharmacological study.

EXPERIMENTAL
Chemistry
The compounds used for preparing the solutions were Merck products, p.a. grade: La(NO3)3 · 6H2O.
H2L1 and H2L2 were used for the preparation of metal
complexes as ligands (). The synthesis of
the ligands was described recently by us [].

The complexes of lanthanum(III) with H2L1 and
H2L2 were synthesized by reaction of lanthanum(III) salt
and the ligand, in amounts equal to metal : ligand molar ratio of
1 : 2. The ligands were insoluble in water. On raising the pH by
the dropwise addition of a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide
(0.1 mol L−1), the ligands were dissolved. The complexes
were prepared by adding aqueous solution of Ln(III) salts
(1 mmol) to the solution of the respective ligand
(2 mmol). The reaction mixtures were stirred with an
electromagnetic stirrer at 25°C for one hour. At the
moment of mixing of the solutions, precipitates were obtained. The
precipitates were filtered, washed several times with water, and dried in a desicator to constant weight. Yields are: La(L1)(OH) · H2O (94%);
La(L2)(OH) · 2H2O (89%).

The complexes were insoluble in water, slightly soluble in
methanol and ethanol, and well soluble in DMSO.

The carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents of the compounds were
determined by elemental analysis.

The water content was determined by Metrohn Herizall E55 Karl
Fisher Titrator.

IR spectra (Nujol) were recorded on spectrophotometers FTIR-8101M
Shimadzu (3800–400 cm−1) and Perkin-Elmer GX auto image
system (700–200 cm−1).

1H-NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on Brucker
WP 250 (250 MHz) spectrometer in DMSO-d6. Chemical
shifts are given in ppm.

13C-NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature on Brucker
250 WM (62.9 MHz) spectrometer in DMSO-d6. Chemical
shifts are given in ppm, downfield from TMS.

Mass spectra were recorded on a Jeol JMS D 300 double focusing
mass spectrometer coupled to a JMA 2000 data system. The
compounds were introduced by direct inlet probe, heated from
50°C to 400°C at a rate of
100°C/min. The ionization current was 300 mA,
the accelerating voltage 3 kV, and the chamber temperature
150°C.

Pharmacology
In the present study, we performed a cytotoxic-effects screening
of the lanthanum complexes with H2L1 and H2L2
in a panel of human tumor cell lines, using the standard MTT-dye
reduction assay for cell viability. The panel consisted of the
acute myeloid leukemia-derived HL-60 and the chronic myeloid
leukemia-derived BV-173.

In order to shed some light over the mechanistic particulars
engaged in the cytotoxic mode of action of the new lanthanum
complexes, we carried out DNA-isolation and gel electrophoresis to
evaluate the ability of the more active lanthanum complex with
H2L1 to trigger programmed cell death.

Cell culture maintenance, drug solutions, and treatment

The human tumor cell lines used in the present study were
supplied from the Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures at
the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. They
were maintained as suspension—type cultures at standard
conditions: humidified atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide, at
37°C in a “Heraeus” incubator, using RPMI-1640
medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum
and 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were kept in log phase via
replacement of cellular suspension aliquots by fresh medium two
or three times weekly.

Stock solutions of the new investigated lanthanum complexes
(200 mM) were freshly prepared in DMSO and diluted with
RPMI-1640 in order to obtain the desired final concentrations.
Less than 1% of the solvent was available at the final dilutions
obtained.

All of the procedures concerning the cell culture maintenance,
drug dissolution, and treatment were carried out in a “Heraeus”
Laminar flow cabinet.

Cell viability determination (MTT assay)

The MTT-dye reduction assay was carried out as described by
Mosmann [] with some modifications []. Briefly,
exponentially growing cells were seeded in 96-well plates
(100 μL aliquots/well) at a density of 1 ×
105 cells/mL. After a 24 hours incubation at
37°C, they were exposed to either the lanthanum
complex of H2L1 or the lanthanum complex with H2L2 (12.5–200 μM) for 72 hours. After the
incubation period expired, 10 μL aliquots of MTT solution
(10 mg/mL in PBS) were added to every well. Thereafter the
plates were incubated for 4 hours at 37°C and the formazan crystals formed were dissolved through addition of
100 μL/well 5% formic acid in 2-propanol (Merck). The
absorption of the samples was measured using an ELISA reader
(Uniscan Titertec) at wavelength of 580 nm. The blank
consisted of 100 μL RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma),
10 μL MTT stock, and 100 μL 5% formic acid in
2-propanol.

DNA isolation and gel electrophoresis

The DNA extraction and horizontal gel electrophoresis procedures
were executed as previously described []. About 5 × 106 treated and untreated BV-173 cells were washed in PBS.
Cell pellets were re-dispersed in 0.25 mL PBS and lysed
through addition of 0.5 mL buffer containing 0.5% Triton
X-100, 20 mM Tris-HCL, and 1 mM EDTA (pH = 7.4).
Samples were incubated on ice for 5 minutes and then centrifuged
at 13 000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatants were
transferred into 2 mL Eppendorf safe lock tubes and then
0.937 mL 2-propanol as well as 0.187 mL 6M solution of
NaCl were added to each sample. The tubes were gently agitated and
incubated at −20°C overnight in order to allow
DNA precipitation. The samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes at
13 000 rpm, the supernatants were decanted and DNA was washed
in 1 mL ice cold 70% ethanol and then air dried. The
isolated DNA was dissolved in 20 μL purified water and
analyzed by gel electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel. Finally DNA
was visualized by means of ethidium bromide staining and UV
transillumination and photographed with a fixed digital camera
(Bio Doc IT™ system).

Statistics

The data processing included the Student t test with p ≤ 0.05 taken as significance level, using Microsoft EXCEL for PC.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chemistry
The complexes were characterized by elemental analysis. The metal
ion was determined after mineralization. The water content in the
complexes was determined by Karl Fisher analysis. The formation
of the complexes was confirmed by IR-spectroscopy,
1H, 13C-NMR-spectrometry, and mass spectral
data.

 shows the data of the elemental analysis of the complexes
serving as a basis for the determination of their empirical
formulae. The elemental analysis data of the La(III)
complexes obtained are in agreement with the presented formulas.

The suggested formulas were further confirmed by mass spectral
fragmentation analysis. As it is seen from ,
the first peaks in the La(III) complexes spectra (although
with low intensity) correspond to the mass weight of the complex
formation (La(L1)(OH) · H2O and
La(L2)(OH) · 2H2O, resp) and the next
ones to that of the ligands. The results thus obtained are in
agreement with metal : ligand ratio 1 : 1 in the investigated
complexes. The data of mass  spectral  fragmentation of the
ligands and of the complexes are presented in .

IR spectra of the complexes

The mode of bonding of the ligands to La(III) was
elucidated by recording the IR spectra of the complexes as
compared with that of the free ligands.

IR spectra of the compounds were recorded on solid state in Nujol
in the range 3800–400 cm−1. The data of the IR spectra
of H2L1, H2L2, and of the lanthanum complexes
with these ligands are presented in .

IR Spectrum of the lanthanum complex of H2L1

The bands appear in the IR spectrum of H2L1 at 3074,
3032; 1660, 1617; 1605, 1568; 1496, 1182, 1160, 1092,
1074 cm−1. The bands at 1660 and 1617 cm−1 can
be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the carbonyl groups
of the lacton rings. Bands at 1605 and 1568 cm−1 can be
related to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated olefinic
system. The vibrations at 1496 cm−1 correspond to the
aromatic systems.

A broad band, characteristic of νOH of
coordinated water, was observed in the range
3300–3400 cm−1 in the spectrum of the complex. The weak
bands observed at 3074 and 3032  cm−1 in the spectrum of
the free ligand are missing in the spectrum of the complex. A
comparison of the infrared spectra of the ligand and of the
complex reveals the disappearance of absorption bands observed in
the free ligand at 3074, 3032 cm−1 and 1345,
1336 cm−1 associated with the stretching and deformation
OH of the phenolic groups, indicating the loss of phenolic
protons on complexation, thus forming metal-oxygen bonds, which
appear as bands in the far IR region.

The νC=O bands at 1660 and
1617 cm−1 exhibit a shift of 30–40 cm−1 to
lower wavenumber values on complexation, which may be taken as
evidence for the participation of the C=O groups in
coordination.

The C−C and C−O stretch and the
C−O−C band are all shifted in the complex. Similar
frequency shifts are observed for the other complexes and are
attributed to complexation of the positive ion with the carbonyl
oxygen [].

IR Spectrum of the lanthanum complex of H2L2

The bands appear in the IR spectrum of H2L2 at 3139,
3070; 1669, 1635; 1610, 1539; 1496, 1187, 1150, 1110,
1044 cm−1. The bands at 1669 and 1635 cm−1 can
be attributed to the stretching vibrations of the carbonyl groups
of the lacton rings. Bands at 1610 and 1539 cm−1 can be
related to the stretching vibrations of the conjugated olefinic
system. The vibrations at 1496 cm−1 correspond to the
aromatic systems. Bands at 1620–1417 cm−1 can be
attributed to the stretching vibrations of pyrazol and they
remain almost the same in the complex.

A broad band, characteristic of νOH of coordinated water, was observed in the range 3300–3400 cm−1 in the spectrum of the complex. The weak bands observed at 3139 and
3070 cm−1 in the spectrum of the free ligand are missing
in the spectrum of the complex. A comparison of the infrared
spectra of the ligand and of the complex reveals the disappearance
of absorption bands observed in the free ligand at 3139,
3070 cm−1 and 1360, 1300 cm−1 associated with
the stretching and deformation OH of the phenolic groups,
indicating the loss of phenolic protons on complexation, thus
forming a metal-oxygen bonds, which appear as bands in the far IR
region.

The νC=O bands at 1669 and
1635 cm−1 exhibit a shift of 20–30 cm−1 to
lower wavenumber values on complexation, which may be taken as
evidence for the participation of the C=O groups in
coordination.

The C−C and C−O stretch and the
C−O−C band are all shifted in the complex. Similar
frequency shifts are observed for the other complexes and are
attributed to complexation of the positive ion with the carbonyl
oxygen [].

IR spectra of the compounds were recorded on solid state in Nujol
in the range 700–220 cm−1. The spectra of the complexes
showed new bands, in comparison with these of the free ligands,
which have been assigned to the rocking, waggling, and
metal-oxygen stretching vibrations.

1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of the ligands and their La(III) complexes

Metal ion coordination with ligand by means of oxygen atoms of
C=O groups and of the deprotonated hydroxyl groups was shown
owing to data of 1H
 and 13C-NMR spectra.

Proton spectra of the compounds recorded at 250 MHz in
DMSO-d6 confirmed the formation of the complex. The typical
chemical shifts of the 1H-NMR spectra in DMSO-d6
are presented in . As it is seen from
, different chemical shifts were observed in the
complexes and these changes were attributed to coordination of
the ligands to La(III).

13C-NMR spectra of the ligands and of the complexes
were recorded at 62.9 MHz in DMSO-d6. The results of
13C-NMR spectra of the compounds in δd (ppm)
are presented in .

The ligand H2L1 showed seven signals in the
13C-NMR spectra resonating at δ 131.91, 128.08,
126.70, 125.58, 123.92, 123.76, and 115.95 ppm for thirteen
methine carbons (). In agreement with
literature data, the peaks at δ 131.91, 123.92, 123.76, and
115.95 ppm were related to C-7, C-5, C-6, and
C-8 (the atom numbering is in agreement with the scheme in ) carbons, respectively, of the
coumarin moieties. The signals at δ 128.08, 126.70, and
125.58 ppm were assigned to C-3′ (and
C-5′), C-4′, and
C-2′ (and C-6′) carbons of the
phenyl ring. The chemical shifts at δ 165.36, 164.87,
152.23, 139.94, 117.96, and 104.13 ppm are due to the
C-2, C-4, C-8a, C-1′,
C-4a, and C-3 quaternary carbons, respectively. Due to electron transfer from the hydroxyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms to La(III), a difference in chemical shifts was observed for the neighboring C-4, C-3, and C-2 carbon
atoms of the complex and they confirmed the expected coordination
of the ligand through both deprotonated hydroxyl and carbonyl
oxygen atoms. The other carbon atoms were only slightly affected
from the coordination of the metal. Similar chemical shifts were
observed for the other ligand and its complex
(). On the basis of the results thus obtained,
it was suggested that the ligands act as tetradentate ones in the
La(III) complex formation.

In our previous investigation, we have performed accurate density
functional theory study (DFT) of the neutral and deprotonated
ligands []. The results obtained showed that the most
probable reactive sites for electrofilic attack (metal binding) in
the L2− are the carbonylic and the deprotonated
hydroxylic oxygen atoms. Our IR and NMR spectral data confirmed
that the carbonylic and deprotonated hydroxylic oxygen atoms are
included in the coordination to the metal ion in the complexes
studied, as described in the previous sections. Further, molecular
modeling was performed to obtain the most probable molecular
geometry of the complex. Our calculations have showed that it is
unfavorable for one metal ion to coordinate to all four oxygen atoms
of one ligand. Thus, on the basis of the experimental and
theoretical results, we were able to suggest that in the metal
complex, the metal ion coordinates to the carbonylic (O9)
and deprotonated hydroxylic oxygen atoms (O28) from one
ligand and through the carbonylic (O27) and deprotonated
hydroxylic oxygen atoms (O10) from a second ligand, as
it is shown in . The other carbonylic
(O27) and deprotonated hydroxylic oxygen atoms
(O10) from the first ligand will coordinate with another
metal ion, as well, the carbonylic (O9) and
deprotonated hydroxylic oxygen atoms (O28) from the
second ligand will coordinate to the next metal ion, forming a
polymeric structure. The other two coordination sites of the metal
ion () are occupied from an OH group and a water molecule. Thus, the metal ion is 6 coordinate, the
ligand is tetradentate, and the metal : ligand ratio is 1 : 1, as
the experimental results showed.

Pharmacology
In vitro cytotoxicity

The spectrophotometric data regarding the MTT-dye reduction assay
are summarized in .

The newly-synthesized lanthanum complexes exhibited cytotoxic
effects against HL-60 and BV-173 human leukemic cell, that
enabled the construction of concentration-response curves, as
presented in 
Figures –. In order to allow
comparison of their relative potencies, the IC50 values were
extrapolated from the concentration-response curves; these are
summarized on .

As evident from the concentration-response curve on
, the lanthanum complex of H2L1
failed to induce any significant effects at concentrations less
than 25 μM and even certain stimulation of malignant cell
growth was encountered at the lowest concentration. At a
concentration of 50 μM, however, the investigated compound
reduced the viable cells by circa 25%, whereas at
100 μM, the vital cells were less than 20%. At the
highest concentration exploited in our experimental system
(200 μM), an almost total eradication of the malignant
cells was encountered with less than 4% survival fraction. The
other complex exerted marginal cytotoxic effect on HL-60 with
certain stimulation of cellular proliferation at
concentrations up to 100 μM and small reduction of the
cell viability by circa 13% at the highest
concentration of 200 μM.

The data obtained from the evaluation of the cytotoxic activity of
the lanthanum complex of H2L1 on BV-173 cells is shown
in . As evident from the
concentration-response curve, it caused a small increase of cell
viability at the lowest concentrations of 12.5 and 25 μM
by circa 8 and 10%, respectively. At the higher concentrations of
50 μM, the cell survival fraction was reduced by circa 58%, whereas at concentrations higher than 100 μM, the
vital cells were less than 3%. The lanthanum complex with
H2L2 also caused concentration-dependent cytotoxic
effect on BV-173 cells, although less pronounced than that of the
lanthanum complex of H2L1 in respect to both relative
potency and maximal efficacy encountered. At concentrations of 25
and 50 μM, the lanthanum complex with H2L2
reduced the viable cells by circa 20%, whereas at the higher
concentration of 100 μM, it caused circa 31% inhibition
of malignant cell proliferation. The treatment of BV-173 cells
with 200 μM of the lanthanum complex with H2L2
resulted in circa 80% reduction of cell viability.

In contrast to the observed effects of the lanthanum complexes,
the corresponding lanthanum(III) nitrate was practically devoid
of cytotoxic effects at the same experimental conditions
[–].

DNA-fragmentation analysis

Following a 24 hours treatment of BV-173 cells with lanthanum
complex of H2L1 at 100 or 200 μM led to an
  DNA-laddering, that is indicative for the programmed cell death
(). These findings suggest that the observed
cytotoxicity of the lanthanum complex of H2L1 on BV-173
is at least partly mediated through induction of programmed cell
death.

CONCLUSIONS
The coordination ability of the ligands has been proved in
complexation reaction with lanthanum(III) ion. The elemental analysis and mass spectral data confirmed the compositions of the compounds. 1H-,
13C-NMR-, and IR-spectral analysis of the ligands and their La(III) complexes confirmed the suggested coordination of the ligands through both the hydroxyl and carbonyl
oxygen atoms.

In our hands, the two novel lanthanum complexes under
investigation exhibited in vitro cytotoxic effects in micromolar
concentrations. The lanthanum complex with H2L1, however,
demonstrated far more pronounced cytotoxic effects as compared to
the lanthanum complex with H2L2. On the basis of the
observed considerable cytotoxic  activity  of lanthanum complex with
H2L1 on HL-60 and BV-173 human leukemic cells, together
with its documented ability to trigger programmed cell death, it
could be concluded that lanthanum complex with 
H2L1
deserves further detailed pharmacological and toxicological
evaluation.

According to our expectations, the complexes of lanthanum(III)
possess a cytotoxic activity and their in vitro effects are
clearly expressed. These results confirmed our previous
observations on the cytotoxicity of lanthanum(III) complexes.
