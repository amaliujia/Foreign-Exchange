ABSTRACT
A new ligand, N-isonicotinoyl-N'-o-hydroxythiobenzhydrazide (H21otbh), forms complexes
[Co(Iotbh)(H20)2], [M(Iotbh)] [M Ni(II) Cu(II) and Zn(ll)] and [M(Iotbh-H)(H_O)2] [M Mn(III), Fe(III)],
which were characterized by various physico-chemical techniques. DMSO solution of metal complexes was
observed to inhibit the growth of tumor in vitro, whereas the ligand did not. In vivo administration of these
complexes resulted in prolongation of survival of tumor-bearing mice. Tumor-bearing mice administered
with the solution of metal complexes showed reversal of tumor growth associated induction of apoptosis in
lymphocytes. The paper discusses the possible mechanisms and therapeutic implications of the Hzlotbh and
its metal complexes in tumor regression and tumor growth associated immunosuppression.
INTRODUCTION
Transition metal complexes of a few thiohydrazides and their N-substituted derivatives have been
reported/1-6/. Hydrazones derived from the condensation of isonicotinic acid hydrazide(INH) with pyridine
aldehydes were found to possess better antitubercular activity than INH/7/, and this was attributed to their
metal chelating abilities/8-12/. Recently it was confirmed that INH forms ,a lipid-soluble copper chelate
which facilitates cell internalization and it has been approved as a first line antitubercular compound used in
DOT programme advocated by WHO/13,14/. Pyridine-2- and -4- carboxaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazones
(HL) form complexes of the type M(HL)CI2. The ligands and their Co(ll),Ni(ll) and Zn(ll) complexes were
found to display significant antibactrial activity/15/. Cu(ll) complex of N-salicyloyl-N'-2-furanthiocarbonyl
hydrazine (Hzsfth) was found to have square planar geometry around Cu(II). The ligand, Hzsfth, showed
better antitumor activity than its Cu(ll) complex/16/. The metal complexes of 4-hydroxyphenyl thiocarboxy
hydrazide and N-salicyloyl-N'-p-hydroxybenzthioyl hydrazine were found to be potent antiviral, antifungal,
antibacterial and antitumor agents /17,18/. In view of the fact that both isonicotinoyl and thiosalicyloyl

groups were reported to display various biological activities such as antibacterial and antitumor, it appeared
worthwhile to synthesize, characterize and study the antitumor and immunomodulatory effect of N-
isonicotinoyl-N'-o-hydroxythiobenhydrazide [(4-CsH4N)C(O)NHNHC(S)2-(HO)C6H4] and its 3d metal
complexes.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The analytical data (Table 1) correspond to the 1:1 metal-to-ligand stoichiometry and the complexes are
coloured. The metal(If) complexes were formed by loss of two protons from the ligand and metal (III)
complexes by loss of one additional proton from the hydroxy group of the salicyloyl moiety. Mn(II) complex
could not be isolated because it is unstable, but after some time due to aerial oxidation of Mn(II) to Mn(III),
the colour of the solution changed from wine red to maroon from which the solid Mn(IIl) complex could be
isolated by the addition of acetonitrile. The water molecules are lost on heating the complexes at 120-150C,
suggesting the coordinate nature of these molecules. Because of steric considerations, all four potential sites
cannot be attached to a single metal and therefore, the ligand binds in a polymeric fashion. The complexes
are soluble in polar coordinating solvent such as DMSO and melt above 340C, except the complexes of
Co(II), Cu(ll) and Zn(II).
Magnetic properties and electronic spectra
The magnetic moments of Mn(III), Fe(III) and Co(II) complexes suggest their distorted octahedral
geometry which is further supported by the UV-Vis spectral data. [Mn(Iotbh-H)(H20)2] exhibits a magnetic
moment of 4.9 B.M. and shows two d-d bands at 16850 and 18050 cm-1
assigned to the 5Big Ag, 5T2g
transitions, respectively for six coordinate Mn(III). For [Fe(lotbh-H)(HO)2], a magnetic moment of 5.9 B.M.
and an UV-Vis band at 20830 cm assigned to d-d or charge-transfer transition clearly suggest a high-spin
iron(Ill) centre. [Co(Iotbh)(H20)2] exhibits a magnetic moment of 5.0 B.M., suggesting a high-spin
octahedral geometry around Co(ll) which is further supported by the occurrence of electronic spectral bands
at 16800 and 19560 cm
-assigned to the 4T 4Alg -' lg, 4Tlg (P) transitions, respectively. The magnetic moment
and UV-Vis spectral data of Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes suggest their square-planar geometry. [Ni(Iotbh)] is
diamagnetic and displays bands at 16500 and 20350 cm which may be assigned to the Alg 1B:2g and Bg
transitions, respectively. [Cu(lotbh)] exhibits a magnetic moment of 1.78 B.M. and the presence of a broad d-
d band at 16835 cm assigned to the envelope of 2Big --->2Alg 2B:2g and 2Eg transitions suggests a square-
planar geometry around Cu(ll).

I R spectra
The IR spectrum of H21otbh shows bands at 3447 and 3202 cm assigned to v(OH) and v(NH),
respectively. The bands occurring at 1674, 1433, 1332, 1060 and 960 cm!
are assigned to v(C-O), thioamide
[I3(NH) + v(CN)], thioamide II [v(CN) + [3(NH)], v(N-N) and v(C=S), respectively. A broad band in the
region of 3450-3460 cm observed in the spectra ofhydrated complexes may be assigned to the v(OH) ofthe
ligand as well as ofwater molecules. The bands due to v(NH), v(C=O) and v(C=S) ofthe ligand are absent in
the complexes and in place of these, two new bands appear in the regions of 1605-1620 cm
-and 820-860
cm due to v(C=N) of NCO and v(CS) modes, respectively, suggesting that both -NHNH- protons are lost
via enolisation and thioenolisation and bonding of the resulting enolic oxygen and thiolato sulfur takes place
with the metal ion /19/. The thioamide I, II and v(N-N) undergo a positve shift of 25, 30 and 40 cm-,
respectively, suggesting bonding through thiolato sulfur and hydrazinic nitrogen. [M(Iotbh)] [M Ni(II),
Cu(II) and Zn(II)] exhibit bands for v(OH) in the region of 3435- 3456 cm.[M(Iotbh-H)(H20)2] [M
Mn(III) and Fe(IIl)] show the absence of bands due to v(OH) (phenolic), v(NH), v(C=O) and v(C=S) which
suggests loss of both hydrazinic protons (via enolisatisation and thioenolisation) and of phenolic proton.This

is further supported by the presence of new bands at 1597 and 837 cm"1
for v(C=N) of NCO and v(C-S),
respectively. Thus, the ligand binds Mn(Ill) and Fe(lll) through enolic oxygen, thiolato sulfur and phenolate
oxygen in addition to one hydrazine nitrogen. The positive shifts of 42 and 20 cml
in thioamide and v(N-
N), respectively, also suggest the involvement of these groups in bonding. Furthermore, the presence of
bands due to v(OH) and p,.(H_O) suggest the coordinated nature ofwater molecules.
M6ssbauer spectra
The M6ssbauer spectrum (Fig. 2a) of [Fe(lotbh-H)(H20)2] at room temperature shows a singlet with
isomer shift of cS 0.32 mm sl
and quadrupole splitting of A 0.31 mm sl
typical of high-spin iron(Ill). On
lowering the temperature to 78 K it shows (Fig. 2b) the presence of two sites. The values of isomer shift and
quadrupole splitting for site are 0.25 and 0.48 mms,respectively, for high-spin iron(Ill) and the
corresponding MB parameters for site 2 are 0.68 and 0.84 mm sl, respectively, for low-spin iron(Ill) in 3:1
ratio, thereby, suggesting the presence ofboth high-spin and low-spin states of iron(III) at 78 K.
ESR spectra
[Cu(Iotbh)] shows an isotropic ESR spectrum at room temperature. The giso 2.086 is typical of a Cu(II)
chelate ascribing a square-planar geometry around the metal ion. The room temperature solid state ESR
spectrum of [Fe(Iotbh-H)(H20)2] exhibits g+/- 5.654 and gll 2.042 arising from very large zero-field
splitting in six-coordinate, high-spin iron(Ill)..The values of g+/- and gll also suggest distorted octahedral
geometry around Fe(III)/20/.
Antitumor Studies
To investigate the antitumor activity of H21otbh and its metal complexes, their effect on the growth of
Dalton's Lymphoma (DL) cells in vitro was measured by MTT assay. It was observed that treatment of
tumor cells with a DMSO solution of [Cu(Iotbh)] caused maximum growth inhibition followed by [Fe(Iotbh-
H)(H20)2] and the ligand (Table 2). The reason for the observed inhibition oftumor cell growth by the metal
complexes is unclear, however, several possibilities could be considered. The cytostatic activity of the metal
complexes could be a direct result of the interaction of the metal complexes with DNA, thus interfering with
the process of DNA replication. Indeed, DNA binding of metal complexes has been documented /21/.
Furthermore, inhibition/activation of various enzymes directly/indirectly involved in DNA replication is not
ruled out. Interaction of metal complexes with protein components of viable cells has been reported/22,23/.
Binding of metal complexes with protein may cause alterations in the structural and functional organization
of proteins. However, more studies will be needed to confirm the existence of one or more of such
possibilities in our system. These results may also indicate a possible decline of the overall metabolic activity
ofthe tumor cells with a concomitant inhibition ofthe activity of various enzymes involved in respiration.

Although the metal complexes showed cytostatic effects on the tumor cells in vitro, these results do not
necessarily indicate if these cells are actually killed by the direct action of the metal complexes. To check
this, in the next part of the investigation we studied the effect of the metal complexes on the tumor cell
killing with respect to the mode of cell death. Cisplatin has been reported to induce apoptotic cell death in the
tumor cells/24,25/, it was observed that the tumor cells were killed by the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3a).
[Cu(lotbh)] was tbund to be most effective in the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. The mechanism of the
induction of apoptosis remains poorly understood and is thought to be dependent on multiple mechanism(s)
ultimately culminating in the activation of DNA cleaving endonucleases /24,26/. As shown in Fig. 3b,
[Cu(lotbh)] and [Fe(lotbh-H)(H20)2] cause an increase in % specific DNA fragmentation" it is probable that
these metal complexes may act via the activation of endonucleases to kill the tumor cells by inducing
apoptotic cell death.
Furthermore, the metal complexes at the concentration checked did not inhibit the growth of normal
splenocyte and bone marrow cells (data not shown), which comprise a major proportion of proliferating cells
indicating that the cytostatic effect of the metal complexes was limited to the tumor phenotype and not on all
proliferating cells. The killing of tumor cells specifically could be attributed to the susceptibility of tumor cell
DNA to a damage by metal complexes as compared to the normal cells. Indeed, in the case ofcisplatin it has
been shown that the tumor cells are killed specifically because they are unable to overcome the genetic load
of mutations caused by the drug because oftheir defective DNA repair mechanism/27/.
In the next part of the investigation we checked the life prolonging effect in DL bearing mice
administered with PBS (phosphate buffer saline) alone or containing the ligand or metal complexes as
indicated in the experimental section. As shown in Table 3 minimal % T/C was observed in mice
administered with the ligand alone as compared to that of mice administered with metal complexes.
Maximum % T/C was found for [Cu(lotbh)] followed by that of [Fe(lotbh-H)(H20);]. Our observations show
that H2lotbh and [Zn(lotbh)] did not have antitumor activity whereas, significantly higher life prolonging
ability in tumor bearing mice were observed tbr [Cu(iotbh)] and [Fe(Iotbh-H)(H20)2]. Increase in the value

that such an effect could result either from the direct cytotoxic/cytostatic action of the complexes on tumor
cells or from the activation ofcertain host derived mechanism resulting in a decrease oftumor load.

Progression of growth of various tumors including DL is invariably associated with the onset of
immunosuppression in tumor bearing host/28-31/, one of the reasons being induction of apoptosis and
inhibition of proliferation ofhematopoietic precursor cells/32,33/. Since in vivo administration ofthese metal
complexes prolonged survival of tumor bearing animals and these metal complexes did not show cytotoxicity
against normal cells in vitro, we were interested to investigate ifthe administration of metal complexes could
reverse tumor growth associated inductiOn of apoptosis in various hematopoietic cells. For this DL bearing
mice were administered with metal complexes, and the % of apoptotic thymocyte, splenocyte and bone
marrow cells were enumerated. As shown in Fig. 4a, administration of metal complexes in tumor bearing
mice resulted in the inhibition of tumor associated apoptosis of thymocyte, splenocyte and bone marrow
cells. Similar results were obtained for % DNA fragmentation as well (Fig. 4b). The reversal oftumor growth
associated induction of apoptosis of hematopoietic cells by metal complexes is predicted to be due to two
reasons: 1. reduction of tumor load resulting due to the cytotoxic effect of metal complexes on tumor cells,
leading to a decrease in the tumor associated concentration of apoptotic factors. 2. direct protective effect of
metal complexes on the hematopoietic ceils. Although not very clear, the probability of the latter could be
due to the fact that metal complexes can bind to DNA and several proteins in cells, which could result in the
protective effect.

Although more investigations will be required to confirm the mechanism of action of metal complexes on
tumor and normal cells, the study suggests that [Cu(Iotbh)] and [Fe(Iotbh-H)(H20)2] can cause prolongation
of survival in tumor bearing animals by:
1. Directly killing tumor cells.
2. Reversing tumor associated immunosuppression.
The finding of this investigation may have long lasting clinical implications with the novel proposition
that metal complexes of N-isonicotinoyl- N'-o-hydroxythiobenzhydrazide may have a dual mechanism of
action in tumor regression.
EXPERIMENTAL
Physical measurements
The complexes were analysed for their metal and sulfur contents as described elsewhere/34/. Carbon,
hydrogen and nitrogen contents were estimated on a Perkin-Elmer 240C microanalyzer. The infrared spectra
of the ligand and its complexes were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-5300 spectrophotometer in KBr in the
4000-400 cm1
region. The electronic spectra were recorded on a Cary-2390 UV-Visible spectrophotometer
in DMSO solution and as Nujol mulls /35/. Room temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were
made on a Cahn Faraday electrobalance using cobalt mercury tetrathiocyanate as a calibrant and the
experimental magnetic susceptibilities were corrected for diamagnetism by using the procedure of Figgis and
Lewis /36/. The MOssbauer spectra were collected using a Cryophysics MS-1 microprocessor controlled
spectrometer operating in the constant acceleration mode.
Antitumor screening
Mice
Inbred populations of BALB/c mice of either sex of 8-12 weeks were used for the study. The mice were
fed food and water ad libitum under pathogen-free conditions and were treated with utmost human care.
Tumor Systems
Dalton's Lymphoma (a spontaneous murine T cell lymphoma) were maintained in culture in vitro as well
as in ascites by serial transplantation in BALB/c mice by an intraperitoneal injection of 5 105 cell/mouse.
Thymocytepreparation and culture
Thymuses obtained from normal and tumor bearing mice with or without administration of the DMSO
solutions of the complexes were weighed on a chilled watch glass, diced on ice and passed through a
stainless steel screen using a syringe plunger. These cells, after washing with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) by centrifugation at 200g for 10 rain at 4 C, were used directly for thymocyte counts. Cell viability in
the thymocyte preparation was determined by mixing 10 mL sample with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan

blue-PBS solution/37/and counting the cells on a hemocytorneter under light microscope. Cells that did not
exclude trypan blue were considered nonviable. For culturing thymocytes in vitro, thymocytes were
maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Splenocyte Preparation and Culture
Spleens obtained from normal and tumor bearing mice with or without administration of complexes were
weighed on a chilled watch glass, diced on ice and passed through a stainless steel screen using a syringe
plunger. These cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by centrifugation at 200x g for 10
min at 4C, and erythrocytes were then depleted by treatment with 0.84% ammonium chloride for 10 min at
room temperature. Cells were again washed in PBS and then cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2,
to remove adherent cells. Non-adherent cells were collected and used for assay.
Bone Marrow Cell Preparation and Culture
Bone marrow cells (BMC) were obtained from the femurs of normal and tumor bearing mice with or
without administration of complexes, as described elsewhere /38/. Briefly, mice were killed by cervical
dislocation and the BMC were obtained from the femoral shafts by flushing them with serum-free medium.
BMC were then agitated gently to prepare a single cell suspension and then washed thrice with serum-free
medium by centrifugation at 200x g at 4 C. BMC were then incubated in plastic tissue culture flask for 2 h
at 37 C to remove the adherent macrophage. The non-adherent BMC were then used for proliferation.
Proliferation assay
Different cells obtained from normal or tumor bearing mice treated with or without complexes were
incubated at a concentration of 1.5 x 106 cells per well in a 96 well plastic tissue culture plate with medium
containing sub-mitogenic doses of concanavalin-A (1 lag/mL). Cultures were then incubated at 37 C in a
COz incubator for 48h and assayed for proliferation and growth inhibition using MTT assay.
In vitro growth inhibitory assay
The MTT assay was used to measure the cytotoxic effect ofthe ligand and the complexes. The procedures
employed the pale yellow tetrazolium salt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol)-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide] (MTT), which was cleaved by active mitochondria to form a dark blue formazan product that can
be completely solubilized in acidic isopropanol /39/. The assay provides a simple way to detect living and
growing cells without use of radioactivity. Briefly, 5 x 104 tumor cells were plated in triplicate in a 96-well
flat bottom tissue culture plates, and treated with different concentrations of drugs for the time indicated.
MTT (0.005 g cm3
in PBS) was added to the cell culture and incubated for 4h at 37 C in a 5% CO2
humidified incubator. The formazan crystals formed during the reaction were dissolved in 100 tL of 0.04N
HC1 in isopropanol and absorbance was read at 570 nm. The average drug concentration (lag/mL) for 50%
inhibition (IC0) of tumor cell-growth was determined by plotting the log of drug concentration versus the
growth rate (% control).

Morphological evaluation ofapoptotic cells
Cells were air dried, fixed in methanol, stained with Wright staining solution, mounted in glycerine and
analyzed under light microscope at 45x magnification. Apoptotic cells were identified on the basis of
morphological features that included contracted cell bodies, condensed, uniformly circumscribed and densely
stained chromatin, or membrane-bound apoptotic bodies containing one or more nuclear fragments/40/. The
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by counting more than 300 cells in at least three separate
visions.
Quantitation ofpercent DNAfragmentation
Percent DNA fragmentation was quantified following a method described by Sellins and Cohen/41/with
slight modification. Cells (5 x 105 cells/mL) were suspended in 0.5 mL of lysis buffer (Tris-EDTA buffer, pH
7.4 containing 0.2% Triton X-100) and centrifuged for 15 min at 13000x g at 4 C in .a microfuge tube
(labeled as B). Supernatant was transferred to another tube (labeled as T). 0.5 mL of 25% trichloroacetic acid
was added to T and B tubes, which were.then to be vortexed vigorously. Tubes were kept overnight at 4 C
for precipitation. Supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 13000x g for 10 rain and then DNA in
each pellet were hydrolyzed with 80 laL of 5% trichloroacetic acid by heating on water bath at 90 C for 15
min and 160 laL of freshly prepared diphenylamine (150 mg diphenylamine in 10 mL glacial acetic acid, 150
laL conc.H2SO4 and 50 mL of acetaldehyde solution) was added and the tubes were allowed to stand.
overnight at room temperature to develop colour. 100 laL of this coloured solution was transferred to a 96
well flat bottom ELISA plate and absorbance at 600 nm noted onan ELISA plate reader. Percent fragmented
DNA was calculated using the formula:
% fragmented DNA-
T+B

where T absorbance of fragmented DNA, T + B absorbance oftotal DNA.
In vivo studies
In order to assess the antitumor activity of the compounds, 6-8 groups of BALB/c mice were inoculated
intraperitoneally with DL cells (106) followed by treatment with the metal complexes (10 mg /kg body
weight) in a single i.p. injection on days 1, 5, 9 and 12 after tumor transplantation. This treatment protocol
was selected for administration, as previous studies/42/have shown that metal complexes of sulfur donor
ligands have shown optimal antitumor activity at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The antitumor efficacy of each agent is
expressed as % T/C and is given by,
Mean life span oftreated mice

Vol. 1, Nos. 3-4, 2003 Antitumor Effect os Some 3d-Metal Complexes ofBivalent Manganese:
Synthetic, Spectroscopic and Medicinal Approach
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sodium salt of o-hydroxydithiobenzoate: A solution of o-hydroxybenzaldehyde (21mL- 25g) in 60 mL
of ethanol was heated to 65 C and 135 mL of the filtered ammonium polysulfide solution was added in l0
mL portions during 10 min., keeping the temperature at 65C. The reaction mixture was boiled to reflux for
h, immediately cooled in ice, 200 mL of ether was added and the solution was acidified with conc. HCI. The
dithioacid that separated as red oil was filtered through suction to remove the precipitated sulfur. The filtrate
was transferred into a separating funnel, 100 mL of ether was also added and the ethereal layer containing the
dithioacid was separated and washed with cold distilled water. The red coloured sodium salt ofthe dithioacid
was extracted by shaking the ethereal solution of the dithioacid twice with aqueous NaOH solution(8g in 100
mL).
Carboxymethyl-o-hydroxydithiobenzoate: To the sodium salt of o-hydroxydithiobenzoate was added a
solution of chloroacetic acid (20g) neutralized with sodium carbonate and pH of the mixture was adjusted to
-7. After standing the reaction mixture overnight at room temperature, the dark solution was acidified with
conc. HCI and the ester which separated on cooling was filtered off, washed with cold water and
recrystallized from hot ethanol in the presence ofanimal charcoal, m.p. 120C (lit. 121C)/43/.
N-Isonicot#wyI-N'-o-hydroxythiobenzhydrazide (H21otbh) was prepared by mixing an equivalent quantity
of carboxymethyl-o-hydroxydithiobenzoate and isonicotinic acid hydrazide, each dissolved separately in one
equivalent of 1N NaOH solution and adding acetic acid dropwise to the above ice cooled solution, after
standing the solution for-2 h. The product thus obtained was suction filtered, washed with water and
recrystallized from ethanol which yielded white compound. [Co(lotbh)(H20)2], [M(Iotbh)] [M Ni(II),
Cu(II) or Zn(II)] and [M(Iotbh-H)(H20)e] [M Mn(III) or Fe(III)] were prepared by adding a DMF solution
(10 mL) of HIotbh (0.8g, 2.9 mmol) dropwise to the ethanolic/aqueous solution (20 mL) of the respective
metal(II) acetate or FeSO4.7H20 in an 1:1 molar ratio. Coloured precipitate of the complexes started
separating out after 5 min of stirring at room temperature but the reaction mixture was further stirred at room
temperature for 2 h to ensure the completion of the reaction except for the Mn(III) where, there was no
precipitation even after 3 h of stirring. The reaction mixture changed from wine red to maroon after 15 min of
stirring. The Mn(IIl) complex was precipitated by the addition of acetonitrile. The insoluble complexes thus
obtained were filtered off, washed with ethanol and dried in vacuo. The products obtained were characterized
by various physico-chemical methods.
