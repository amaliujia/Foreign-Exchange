ABSTRACT
Gold(III) complexes are emerging as a new class of metal complexes with outstanding cytotoxic
properties and are presently being evaluated as potential antitumor agents. This renewed interest is the result
of recent studies in which various gold(III) complexes have been shown to be stable under physiological
conditions and to manifest relevant antiproliferative properties against selected human tumor cell lines. The
pharmacological investigation of some representative gold(III) complexes has been extended to consider their
effects on the cell cycle and to reveal induction of apoptosis. Remarkably, preliminary studies suggest that
the interactions in vitro of gold(Ill) complexes with calf thymus DNA are weak whereas significant binding
to model proteins takes place. Our findings imply that the mechanism of action of cytotoxic gold(Ill)
complexes might be substantially different from that ofclinically established platinum compounds.
GOLD(Ill) COMPLEXES AS A POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE TO PLATINUM COMPLEXES.
Following the discovery of the antiproliferative effects of cisplatin, attention was devoted to gold(III)
complexes as a possible alternative to antitumor platinum drugs [1-3]. This interest mainly originated from
the observation that both platinum(II) and gold(III) complexes possess the same electronic configuration (d8)
and give rise preferentially to square planar complexes. Ligand exchange kinetics is relatively slow in both
cases, although faster in gold(III) complexes. Thus, the strict relationship to platinum(If) compounds
rendered gold(III) complexes attracting candidates for development and testing as potential anticancer drugs;

unfortunately their relatively poor chemical stability in solution heavily hindered such studies for a long time.
Thus, until the mid-90's, only a few reports existed in the literature describing the cytotoxic properties and
the in vivo antitumor effects of gold(Ill) complexes [4-6]. In some cases important systemic toxic effects,
produced by gold(Ill) complexes, had been reported [1] and significant differences in the spectrum of action
had been noticed compared to cisplatin.
STRUCTURAL FEATURES OF SOME GOLD(Ill) COMPLEXES.
In recent years, owing to the cofitributions of a few research groups, new gold(Ill) compounds have been
synthesized and characterized that show sufficient stability under physiologically relevant conditions. Such
stabilization is generally achieved through an appropriate choice of the ligands, in most cases bearing
nitrogen atoms as donor groups. A number ofthese gold(llI) compounds are shown in Figure 1.
Recently some organogold(III) compounds, bearing the bipyridyl moiety, have been developed by the
group of Giovanni Minghetti in Sassari (Italy);. typical compounds of this family are shown in Figure 2 (the
crystal structures are available for mO;t ofthese gold(Ill) complexes).
BEHAVIOUR IN SOLUTION OF SELECTED GOLD(Ill) COMPLEXES.
Essential requirements for the pharmacological evaluation in vitro of new metal complexes as cytotoxic
agents are an appreciable solubility in water and a sufficient chemical stability under physiologically relevant
conditions. Thus, prior to any biological testing, the chemical behaviour in solution of newly prepared
gold(III) complexes is analysed in detail. The chemical characterization in solution is mainly performed with
the help of various spectroscopic techniques including visible absorption spectroscopy, H NMR and ESI-MS
[3]. Notably, most gold(Ill) complexes prepared in our laboratory exhibit characteristic and intense
transitions in the visible that have allowed us to test their time-dependent stability. Generally, the visible
spectra recorded after dissolving the individual compounds in the reference buffer (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4,
NaCI 4raM or 100raM) do not show significant modifications for several hours, implying that the gold(Ill)
chromophore does not undergo major transformations. An example is shown in Figure 3.
Subsequent application of ESI-MS and NMR techniques has allowed, in several cases, detailed
identification of the species that are dominant in solution [3]. In various cases, the stability of these gold(Ill)
complexes has been firther assessed in RPMI, the culture medium used for the in vitro cytotoxicity
experiments (unpublished results from our laboratory).
IN VITRO CYTOTOXICITY AS THE MAIN SCREENING METHOD.
Screening of novel compounds for anticancer activity is a major issue for the discovery of new agents
with encouraging pharmacological properties. Presently, the method adopted by NCI is based on in vitro tests
of cytotoxic activity on a panel comprising 60 human tumor cell lines.

Thus, as a first step for their pharmacological evaluation, the activity of some novel gold(Ill) complexes
developed in our laboratory was assayed against a small number of tumor cell lines. This restricted panel
comprised two ovarian carcinoma human cell lines, A2780 (both sensitive and resistant to cisplatin) and
SKOV3, the colon carcinorna HCT8 cell line and the T-lymphoblastoid leukemia CCRF-CEM cell line (both
sensitive and resistant to cisplatin) [3]. Cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% horse serum (CCRF-CEM/S, CCRF-CEM/R and HCT8) or fetal bovine serum (FBS) (SKOV3,
A2780/S and A2780/R) and antibiotics at 37C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and subcultured twice weekly.
Experiments were conducted on exponentially growing cells. The Sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay was
performed in 96-well plates, using RPMI 1640 medium+ 5% FBS, according to the protocol of Skehan [9].
The concentration range used for each gold(lll) complex was between 10"2
.tM and 200.tM. Notably, the
values recorded for several gold(Ill) complexes on the A2780 human tumor cell line are reported in Table 1.

It emerges that most gold(Ill) complexes are highly cytotoxic. Indeed, all investigated gold(Ill)
complexes -except Au(cyclam)- exhibited important cell killing properties toward the reference A2780/S
line, with EDs0 values falling in the micromolar range (from 0.3 to 10 gM). In some cases resistance to
cisplatin is clearly overcome.

In the CCRF-CEM leukemic cell line (Tables 2 and 3 we observed, at least qualitatively, that the longer
the exposure time, the lower is the drug concentration required to kill cells. In some cases, however, the
relationship between the cytotoxic potency and the exposure time is not linear, owing to summation of
various contributions.
[Au(phen)C12]Cl exhibits a profile of cytotoxicity similar to that of cisplatin on the sensitive line,
although the actual concentrations that are needed to achieve the same effects are three times higher.
Remarkably, [Au(phen)Cl2]CI largely overcomes resistance to cisplatin, so that it is at least three times more
effective than cisplatin itself on the resistant line.
[Au(dien)CI]Cl2 is much less effective than [Au(phen)Cl2]Cl, on both cell lines, although their time-
dependent profiles ofcytotoxicity are qualitatively similar.
Both bipyridyl gold(Ill) complexes were shown to produce important cell killing effects on A2780,
SKOV3 and CCRF-CEM lines (Table 4). The ICs0 values of 8.8 laM and 3.3 gM for A2780 match those of
other gold(Ill) complexes, determined under identical conditions. In particular [Au(bipyC-H)(OH)][PF6]
qualifies as one of the most active gold(Ill) complexes on the A2780 line. Lower but still important cytotoxic
effects were detected when both complexes were tested on the SKOV3 and CCRF-CEM cell lines.
Remarkably both compounds are able to overcome to a large extent resistance to cisplatin as witnessed by the
relatively low resistance index values.

Analysis of the cytotoxicity data permits formulation of some preliminary structure/function relationships
that are summarized below:
i) the cytotoxicity of these gold(Ill) complexes is associated to the presence of the gold(III) center (indeed
Au(en)2 and Au(dien) are significantly more cytotoxic than the corresponding platinum compounds);
ii) the presence of hydrolysable chloride groups on the gold(Ill) center or, more in general, of good leaving
groups, does not represent an essential requirement for cytotoxicity;
iii) excessive stabilization of the gold(Ill) center results in loss of biological activity (Au(cyclam), with the
gold(Ill) center tightly bound to the macrocycle cage, is not cytotoxic, probably as a consequence of its
low reactivity).
iv) The amount of gold that enters cells is roughly proportional to the exposure time, at least during the first
hours. Thus, at least qualitatively, the longer the exposure time, the lower the drug concentration
required to kill cells.
Remarkably, most of the gold(Ill) compounds are able to overcome to a large extent resistance to
cisplatin as witnessed by the relatively low resistance index values, suggesting a different mechanism of
action with respect to cisplatin.

MORE ADVANCED BIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON CELLS: THE CELLULAR EFFECTS
OF TWO REPRESENTATIVE GOLD(Ill) COMPLEXES.
The cell growth inhibition assay represents the standard criterion for the screening of antitumor
compounds. However; this approach does not give direct information on the mechanism of action of the
individual drugs. To better elucidate the possible mechanisms through which cytotoxic gold(Ill) complexes
produce their biological effects, additional work has been carried out in our laboratory on selected tumor cell
lines. Experiments were carried out on the leukemic cell population CCRF-CEM, either sensitive or resistant
to cisplatin, following treatment with two representative gold(Ill) complexes. Specifically, the effects of
Au(phen) and Au(dien) on the above cell lines were monitored by the COMET assay [10,11], and by flow
cytometry studies [12]. This approach has resulted in a detailed description of cell responses to these
gold(Ill) complexes 13].
The single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (COMET assay) is an established method to reveal DNA
damage produced by drugs at the single-cell.level [11,12]. The electrophoretic mobility of alkaline denatured
cellular DNA is retarded by crosslinks that are quantitated as the decrease in comet tail moment, compared to
H202-treated controls. No clear relationship can be established between the DNA damage measured by
COMET and the cytotoxic activity. A possible explanation for this lack of correlation is that the cytotoxicity
measured at a given time after drug exposure largely depends on the activity and the efficiency of DNA
repair (excision and polymerization phenomena, for example). However, apart from difficulties in explaining
some features of our experimental results, there is no doubt that the comet profiles are drastically modified by
both gold(Ill) complexes, thus providing unambiguous evidence for a direct interaction of these gold(Ill)
complexes with DNA.
The flow cytometry results show that both gold(Ill) complexes modify the cell cycle less markedly than
equitoxic amounts of cisplatin. The effects induced by gold(Ill) complexes on the sensitive line are modest,
while transient but significant modifications are observed in the resistant line. In spite of the modest effects
produced on the cell cycle, both tested gold(Ill) complexes, but especially Au(phen), were shown to induce
significant DNA fragmentation, suggestive of induction of apoptosis.
DNA AS A POSSIBLE TARGET FOR GOLD(Ill) COMPLEXES: A BIOINORGANIC APPROACH
DNA is the primary target for platinum(ll) antitumor compounds and is the probable target for several
other antitumor metal complexes. Thus, we worked on the hypothesis that the cytotoxic effects produced by
this group of gold(Ill) complexes on selected tumor cell lines might be a consequence of direct DNA
damage; some support for this view is offered by the above described COMET experiments.
The reactions of five gold(Ill) complexes- Au(en)2, Au(dien), Au(cyclam), Au(phen) and Au(terpy)-
with calf thymus DNA were analyzed in vitro through a number of classical physico-chemical methods
including spectrophotometry, circular dichroism, analysis of DNA thermal denaturation profiles and dialysis
experiments [14]. Such investigations aimed at describing the gold(III)/DNA reaction in terms of' DNA
structural modifications, strength and kinetic of the interaction, nature and reversibility of gold(III)/DNA
binding.
184
L. Messori et al. Bioinorganic Chemistry andApplications
We demonstrated that the interactions of these gold(Ill) complexes with calf thymus DNA are relatively
weak, reversible and, in most cases, electrostatic in nature. Given its chemical structure Au(cyclam) provides
the best example for a "pure" electrostatic interaction. The same holds for Au(en)2 that probably acts as a
groove binder by analogy with the isostructural Pt(en)2 complex; Au(dien) can form both electrostatic and
covalent bonds. For both Au(phen) and Au(terpy) intercalative binding is possible as well as formation of
coordinative bonds to nucleobases. In all cases, binding is completely reversible and gold(III) complexes are
displaced from DNA by repeated ultrafiltrations.
The effects on DNA conformation produced by the individual gold(III) complexes were best detected by
circular dichroism (a representative experiment is shown in Figure 4).

CD spectra of calf thymus DNA (a) after addition of Au(terpy) at the ratio r 0.1 (b), 0.2 (c), 0.5 (d),
Au(en)2 and Au(dien) at low concentrations were shown to induce few spectral modifications, while
larger effects were observed at higher concentrations still within the frame of a B-type DNA conformation.
Au(cyclam) is more effective than the other polyamine complexes in inducing conformational modifications.
The CD perturbations induced by Au(phen) and Au(terpy) are larger in agreement with an intercalative
binding model. On the basis of the spectrophotometric results mixed binding of Au(terpy) to DNA-first
intercalation, then coordination-may be hypothesized
Also the interactions of the bipyridyl compounds [Au(bipy)(OH)2][PF6] and [Au(bipyC-H)(OH)][PF6]
with DNA were analyzed in detail through the same techniques [6]. It was found that the interactions with the
DNA double helix are weak, reversible and predominantly electrostatic in nature, suggesting that DNA is not
the primary target for the cytotoxic effects ofthese complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
The appreciable stability of these novel gold(Ill) complexes under physiological conditions has allowed
extensive in vitro pharmacological testing. These compounds have been primarily characterized through in
vitro cytotoxictiy assays in line with the general screening strategy of NCI. Some preliminary correlations
between cytotoxicity and the chemical structure have been proposed. In view of the relevant cytotoxic effects
exerted by most of the investigated complexes, more detailed studies have been performed to describe
cellular responses to these substance. It is worth reminding that preliminary COMET results obtained in our
laboratory on Au(dien) and Au(phen) suggest that both complexes are capable of producing a direct DNA
damage. Occurrence of a direct interaction of the present gold(Ill) complexes with DNA is also supported by
CD and DNA melting experiments on calfthymus DNA. However, the interactions of gold(III) complexes
with the DNA double helix are generally weak, reversible and predominantly electrostatic in nature,
suggesting that DNA is not the primary target for the cytotoxic effects ofthese complexes.
