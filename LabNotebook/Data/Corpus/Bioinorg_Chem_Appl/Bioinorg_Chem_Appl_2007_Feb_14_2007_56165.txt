1. INTRODUCTION
Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are highly adapted human pathogens with rapid lytic
cycle and ability to invade sensory neurons. The primary agents of recurrent facial and genital herpes lesions are HSV-1 and HSV-2 while genital herpes (GH) is the most common
sexually transmitted infection in the world [–]. Moreover, GH is the main factor
of increasing three to five times the risk of HIV transmission,
stimulating HIV replication, and finally leading to the
progression of AIDS [–]. Acyclovir (ACV) is a prodrug and it is the
first nucleoside-based therapeutic effective for the treatment
of primary and recurrent HSV infections [].
Effective HSV suppression with ACV indirectly lowers the HIV load.
 ACV has to be phosphorylated by the viral thymidine kinase (TK) and subsequently by cellular kinases in order to inhibit competitively HSV DNA polymerase and to terminate
the viral DNA chain elongation. However, under systematic
administration, resistant mutants appeared with high frequency and
their main sources are immune-compromised individuals
[–]. The two most common causes of resistance are mutations in thymidine kinase (TK) gene, approximately 95% to 96% of ACV-resistant 
(ACVR) HSV isolated are
thymidine-kinase-(TK-)deficient (TKN) or
TK-partial (TKP) and the remaining isolates are
usually TK-altered (TKA) mutants unable to
phosphorylate the prodrug but not the thymidine []. The problem for effective treatment of HSV infections is still open,
since the resistance to ACV and the cross-resistance to other
nucleoside analogs increase with relatively high frequency.

The earliest antivirals are thiosemicarbazones, Tscs. The
bioactivity of Tscs is due to the inhibition of ribonucleotide
reductase (RR) and due to complexation with essential metals
[–].  The activity of Pt(II) and
Pd(II) complexes of pyridine-2-carbaldehyde (HFoTsc)
against the replication of wild type (wt) HSV-1, was
recently referred to by Varadinova et al.  []. The
antiviral activity of platinum complexes with antiviral agents
acyclovir, penciclovir, and famciclovir has been recently
reported [–].

The aim of the present study was to evaluate comparatively the
activity of complexes of Pd(II) and Pt(II) with pyridine-2-carbaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (HFoTsc) against HSV
replication. Special attention was given to the efficacy of
compounds against ACVR viruses.

2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Metal complexes
Solvents were purified and dried according to standard procedures.
The ligand HFoTsc, 1, and the complexes of Pt(II) and Pd(II) [PtCl(FoTsc)], 2, [Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2, 3, [Pt(FoTsc)2], 4, [PdCl(FoTsc)], 5, [Pd(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2, 6, and [Pd(FoTsc)2], 7, were prepared (see ) by some of us, as described in the literature [, , ].

All the compounds were firstly dissolved in DMSO (Koch-Light
Laboratories Ltd, England) till the concentration of 1 M
(stock solutions). Serial tenfold dilutions
(100–0.000001 μM) were made from them in cells
growth medium DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 5% bovine serum (BS; BioWhittaker, Germany) and antibiotics (penicillin G, 100 units/mL, Balkanpharma, Bulgaria).

2.2. Cells and viruses
Continuous Madin-Darbey bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were used in
the experiments. The cells were grown at 37°C in DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% BS and antibiotics. During the
experimentations, BS content was reduced to 5%. Antiviral
experiments were done on the following four viruses: two wild
(wt) strains Victoria (HSV-1) and BJA (HSV-2) and two
ACVR mutants with different TK gene mutations
R-100 (TKA, HSV-1) and PU (TKN, HSV-2). Viruses were grown in MDBK cell monolayers. Cultures were harvested at full cytopathic effect
(CPE), froze, thawed, and stored at −70°C.

2.3. Cytotoxicity and (HSV) assays
Confluent cell monolayers were washed and covered with
media containing the compounds and cultured at 37°C for
48 hours. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was read by microscopy of
unstained cell monolayers. Cell number was counted by the Trypan
blue-dye exclusion method.

The cytotoxic concentration CC50 (concentration
preventing the death of 50% of cells) and the maximal nontoxic
concentration, MNC, were calculated from dose-response curves. The
maximal concentration causing no cytotoxicity which does not alter
the morphology of monolayers and the cell survival rate was
recognized as MNC.

The antiviral activity of the complexes 1–7 against HSV
replication was evaluated on the basis of their effects on the
infectious HSV titer. MDBK cells were grown in 96-well plates and
were infected with particular virus in serial tenfold dilutions.
After 1 hour of virus attachment, infected cells were covered with
medium and the tested compound in serial tenfold dilutions
(starting from MNC) and cultured at 37°C for 48 hours
(for wt strains) or 72 hours (for ACVR
mutants). Inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit virus
yield by 50% (IC50) were calculated from
dose-regression curves and were indicative for anti-HSV activity.
In order to be able to compare the compounds on the basis of their
selective inhibition of virus replication versus cytotoxicity,
selective indexes (SI) were calculated as CC50 to
IC50 ratio. The data were compared with that of ACV.

2.4. Direct PCR for determination of the effect on
the expression of the immediate early (IE)
reiterating region IV (ReIV)
Infected and mocked infected cells cultured in compound-free
medium served as controls. PCR amplification 22 bp primers
(Applied Biosystems, Calif, USA) were designed according
to Maertzdorf et al. []  to amplify 300 bp Us1
ReIV region of HSV-1 genome positions 132333-132634. The sequences
(5′ → 3′) of the primer were
ReIVUs1F-5′TCCGACGACAGAAACCCACC3′ and ReIVUs1R-5′GTCCCGGAGGACCACAGTGG3′.  PCR was
performed in a ready-to-go-PCR beads thermocycle (Amersham-Pharma
Biotech, NJ, USA).

A 2 μl sample  of DNA suspension was
added to the reaction mixtures and was overlaid with 25 μl
of mineral oil (CinnaGen Inc, Iran). PCR amplification
was carried out as follows: an initial denaturation step of
94°C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles of alternating
denaturation (94°C for 30 seconds), primer annealing
(60°C for 60 seconds), and primer extension
(72°C for 60 seconds). A final extension step of 5
minutes at 72°C was included. The PCRs were performed in
10 μl volume. Briefly, 2 μl of each sample were added to a separate tube containing 100 μl of lysis buffer (Applied Biosystems) and stored at −20°C over night.
After centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes, the lysis
buffer was removed, pellets were resuspended in nucleolysis buffer
(300 μl) phenol (Sigma Corporation of
America, NY, USA),  pH 7.8; 300 μl
chloroform: isoamyl alcohol = 24 : 1 (Sigma Corporation
of America), and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5 minutes. DNA
was extracted by resuspending the pellets in 10% SDS (Sigma
Corporation of America) 10 mg/mL proteinase K (Pharma
Biotech, USA), 10 mM Tris (Sigma Corporation of America ) and 0.1 mM EDTA
(Sigma Corporation of America) at pH 7.4 and centrifuged at
12000 rpm for 5 minutes. A volume of 2 μl of
supernatants containing 50–100 ng of the resulting DNA
suspension was used per PCR mixture. The reaction mixture
contained 5 U/μl cloned recombinant thermostable STS DNA
taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), corresponding primers at a
concentration of 20 μl/mL each, and 5 mM/μl deoxynucleoside triphosphate (Pharma Biotech). Amplicons were
electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and were visualized by
ethidium bromide staining.

2.5. Apoptosis/necrosis in the noninfected cells and
in cells infected with HSV
The staining methods of one-chain double-helices DNA have been
used with 0.1% solution of acridine orange, and for mitochondria
a solution of 0.1% of Janus green B has been used. An eukaryotic
model of cells infected with HSV virus was used and the following
modifications in the purpose of adapting the method to the
corresponding system were adapted: (1) fixing of the cell with
methanol not with formaldehyde; (2) after a standard procedure of
staining in view of a further conservation of the preparations,
treating with glycerol PBS = 1 : 1 was used. The
experiments were carried out at the 8 hours of infection in the
initial period of active virus morphogenesis. The following have
been used as controls: (1) cells not infected and untreated with
the investigated compounds; (2) cells not infected but treated
with compounds; (3) cells infected with HSV and cultivated in a
medium without an inhibitor.

The indicators for the lack of apoptosis/necroses were (1) the
apple green fluorescence of cytoplasm and the nuclei according to
the staining test with acridine orange; (2) a diffuse distribution
of mitochondrial, glowing in green according to the staining test
with Janus green B.

The indicators of apoptosis were a glowing of the nuclei in
yellowish-red on a glowing of the cytoplasm in yellowish-green; a
margination of chromatin; and an ejaculation of the nucleus
content.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
CC50 and MNC values were calculated from dose-response
curves and were presented in . All the
compounds 1–7 exhibit lower cytotoxicity than
ACV. MNC ranged from 1–100 μM. Among them, higher
cytotoxicity exhibits [Pt(FoTsc)2] and
[Pd(FoTsc)Cl]. These two complexes are 50 times,
[Pd(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2 and [Pd(FoTsc)2]
are 500 times, and HFoTsc, [Pt(FoTsc)Cl] and
[Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2 are 5000 times less cytotoxic than ACV. The less cytotoxic compounds were HFoTsc (1) and its Pt(II) complexes 2 and 3. The structure of 3 corresponds to
[M(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]X2 [–]. Obviously, the protonated ligand in zwitterion form H2FoTsc+ decreases the cytotoxicity of Pt(II) but not of Pd(II), complex 6.

The data presented on  show that the
cytotoxicity of compounds 1–7 was predetermined by
complex specificities.

The activity of compounds 1–7 was evaluated against
wt HSV-1, strain Victoria, infection in cultured cells,
and the data were compared to that of ACV. The complex 5
did not exhibit any effect on the infectious virus yield and it
was excluded from further investigations. The rest of the
compounds 1–4, 6–7 were further evaluated against wt HSV-2 strain BJA and two
ACVR mutants with different TK gene
mutations-R-100 (TKA) and PU (TKN), see .

The compounds 1–4 and 6-7 effectively inhibited
the growth of wt and of ACVR, HSV-1
and HSV-2 strains and the effect were found to be predetermined by
both complex and virus specificities. The most effective inhibitor
of the wt HSV-1 growth was the ligand 1 while
complex 4 was most sensitive to wt HSV-2. On the
contrary, the growth of ACVR viruses was
effectively suppressed by the complexes 2 and 6.
The complexes of Pt(II) and Pd(II) and HFoTsc are arranged according to their efficacy against all four HSV strains in the following order:

for wt HSV-1: 1 &gt; 4 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 7 ≫ 6;

for wt HSV-2: 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 1 = 3 ≫ 2 &gt; 7;

for ACVR mutants R-100 and PU:
2 = 6 ≫ 4 &gt; 3  = 7.


The selectivity of compounds 1–7 is shown in
 and it was found to be predetermined by both complex and virus specificities. Complexes 1–7 are
arranged according to their selectivity in the following order
against all four strains:
for wt HSV-1: 1 &gt; 3 ≥ ACV &gt; 4 &gt; 2 ≥  7  ≫ 6;

for wt HSV-2: 3 &gt; 4 &gt; ACV &gt; 1 ≥ 6 ≫ 2 &gt; 7;

for ACVR strain R-100: 4 &gt; 2 =  6 &gt; 3 &gt; ACV &gt; 1 &gt; 7;

for ACVR strain PU: 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 = ACV &gt; 1 &gt; 7 = 4.




The complex 3 was more sensitive to wt HSV
strains,  while the complex 2 was more sensitive to ACVR mutants. The complex 7 was the less active and selective inhibitor of HSV
replication  and the complex 3
selectively inhibited the replication of both
wt and ACVR viruses.

The significant activity and selectivity of 3 are
probably due to the negative influence on several viral targets.
This is based on the fact that in solution, [M(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]X2 complexes dissociate to the
metal complex [M(FoTsc)Cl] and the protonated ligand
H2FoTscCl+ [, ], thus simultaneously
suppressing virus-specific RR and the synthesis of DNA progeny.

Virus-specific proteins were identified on the 15 hours by Western
blot analysis. Eleven virus-specific proteins were identified in
viral control: VP5, VP22, VP23, α-TIF, TK, gB, gC, gE, gD,
gH, and gG. In the compounds 1, 3, and
4, VP23, TK, gG/gD, α-TIF, gH, and gE were not
identified, see . These data suggest that
compounds 1, 3, and 4 also suppress the
morphogenesis, cell-to-cell spread, and transactivation of virus
genomes.

In view of the fact that HFoTsc and 3 are not only
effective and selective HSV inhibitors, but they also suppress the
expression of the essential structure proteins from the β(E)
and γ(L) kinetic groups, whose synthesis is impossible
without α, IE proteins, the effect of 3 over the
expression of the immediately earliest α, IE genes by means
of a direct PCR was studied. A direct multiplication was
used with PCR by a primer,  determining region 300 bp,
corresponding to ReIV region of Us1. The results of the gel
electrophoresis of DNA extracted from viral infected control cells
and treated for 2 hours after infection with the HSV-1 with MNC of
[Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2, 3 and HFoTsc and 1 are shown in . Just as expected, it was observed that the DNA of control MDBK cells appears as a band corresponding to genomic DNA (, lane 3). Incubation of the HSV-1 infected cells with the MNC of
[Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2, 3 or the HFoTsc, 1 ligand resulted in a “DNA smears,” which shows the nonspecific fragmentation of DNA (, lanes 5 and 6, resp.). The results received by direct PCR show that
[Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2, 3 (lane 5), and the ligand HFoTsc 1 (lane 6) suppress the expression of the α, IE virus genes. Altogether, these data suggest that in MDBK infected cells, the nonspecific destruction of viral DNA is
obviously caused by Pt(II) ions [, ]  and may be due
to a specific induction of apoptosis.

The effect of 3 on programmed cell death was evaluated
morphologically in order to study if the observed DNA
fragmentation is cell- and/or virus-specific. Using acridine
orange and Janus B green staining morphological changes leading to
irreparable margination of chromatin, an ejaculation of the
nucleus content and other indicators for apoptosis were not found
in wt HSV-1 nor in mock-infected cells on the 8 hours
after the action of [Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2, 3. It was observed that complex 3 specifically
affects HSV replication simultaneously suppressing virus-specific
RR and DNA polymerase and the expression of virus genome
immediately after entering host cell nucleus. This also explains
the nonspecific virus response to [Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2.

The experimental data show that [Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)] · Cl2 complex is a promising anti-HSV agent which could be useful in the treatment  of HSV infections, especially when the causative agent is resistant to ACV mutants. The platinum complex
[Pt(FoTsc)(H2FoTsc)]Cl2 decreases the cytotoxicity of Pt(II) ion and directs its activity to viral and not to host cell DNA.

work to the late Professor T. Varadinova for her contribution to virology.
