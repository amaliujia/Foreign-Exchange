ABSTRACT
Fourteen to eighteen membered tetraazamacrocyclic ligands N4TTD-N4TTD4
have been synthesized by
the condensation of aliphatic diamines. H2N-(CH2)y-NH2 (y 2 or 3) and dicarboxylic acids, HOOC-
(CH2),,-COOH (x 1 or 2) in the presence of condensing reagents dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCHC) and 4-
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). On reduction these macrocyclic ligands give N4TTDS-N4TTD8, which form
complexes with manganese(II) acetate. The new products with octahedral geometry have been characterized
by elemental analyses, molecular weight determinations, magnetic moment and spectral studies viz., infrared,
electronic, mass and X-ray. On the basis of the spectral studies the binding sites are proposed as the nitrogen
atom of the macrocycles. The formulation of the complexes as [Mn(CH3COO)(N4TTD")] (where n 1 8)
has been established on the basis of chemical composition. To assess the growth inhibiting potential of the
ligands and their manganese (II) complexes biological screening have been undertaken. The testicular
morphology, testicular sperm density, sperm motility, density of cauda epididymal spermatozoa and fertility
in mating trials and biochemical parameters of reproductive organs with ligands and their corresponding
complexes, in vivo have also been described in the this communication.
INTRODUCTION
The multifarious roles of transition metals in biochemistry/1-5/suggested that consideration potential
exists for the development of new chemistries with these metals in ligand systems specifically designed to
serve these roles. The enormous interest in the synthesis of the transition metal complexes of the nitrogen
donor ligands arises due to the wide range of pharmacological activities of these compounds, which in
several cases are known to have been enhanced by the presence of transition metals/6,7/. The synthesis of a
series of tetraamide macrocycles which have been designed to afford strongly donating tetraamido-N ligands
upon tetradeprotonation and to be resistant to oxidative degradation has been described. It is demonstrated by

the preparation and characterization of an unprecedented class of square-planar cobalt compounds with high
positive tbrmal reduction potentials that the macrocycles possess the rare property of being compatible with
strongly oxidizing coordination environment/8/. The complexes of the metal ions are significant because of
their resemblance with many natural systems, such as porphyrins and cobalamines. The biological activity of
this class of compounds is associated with the chelation/7/. They are known to function as antimicrobial/9/,
antifertility, antimalaria and antileukemic agents/10/. Many of these transition metal ions in living systems
work as enzymes carriers in a macrocyclic ligand field environment.
Macrocyclic ligands display a number of features of chemical interest. Research into the synthesis,
structure and properties of transition metal macrocyclic complexes to model a wide variety of metalloprotein
active sites or to mimic their chemistry is well established /11/. Collins et al. /12/ have also described
synthesis and characterization of the macrocyclic tetraamido-N-ligands. These tetraanionic ligands are strong
donors and are resistant to the oxidative degradation. It has allowed rare high-valent metal centers such as
five coordinated Fe (IV) and four coordinated Ni (III) to be isolated and fully characterized. Macrocycles
have wide applications in medicine, cancer diagnosis/13/and in the treatment of tumors/14/. Manganese
chloride causes loss of testicular germ cells in rats and rabbits/15/and decreased libido and impotency were
also noted in a man occupationally exposed to manganese/16/. Macr0cyclic complexes of Mn(lI) exhibit a
broad spectrum of biological activity. No work has been reported on the manganese(II) complexes with such
type of tetraazamacrocyclic ligands. Therefore, the importance of the metal-nitrogen bonding and their
prominence in agriculture, medicinal and industrial activity led us to synthesize and screen these compounds
lbr their antifungal, antibacterial and antifertility activities.
EXPERIMENTAL
All the glass apparatus used during the experimental work was fitted with quick fit interchangeable
standard ground joints. The chemicals including dicyclohexylcarobodiimide, 4-dimethylaminopyridine,
Mn(CH.COO)2.4H20, malonic acid, succinic acid (Fluka), amines and LiA1H4 (E. Merck) were used as
received.
Synthesis of the Ligands (N4TTD-N4TTD4)
The reaction was carried out in 2 2 molar ratios. The appropriate (1.5626g; 7.5 mmol) amount of
dicyclohexylgarbodiimide and catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine in 25 mL of dichloromethane at
0rC were kept magnetically stirred in a two-necked round bottom flask. The reaction was followed by the
addition of 1,2-diaminoethane or 1,3-diaminopropane (corresponding to the dicyclohexylcarbo-diimide) in
dichloromethane (25 mL) and malonic or succinic acid (corresponding to DCHC). The resulting reaction
mixture was stirred t'or 10-12 hrs at 0C. The solid product was isolated by filtration and washed with the
same solvent and dried in vacuo. The solid products were recrystallized from benzene and dried in vacuo.

Synthesis of the Ligands (N4TTDS-N4TTDs)
The reaction was carried out in 1 2 molar ratio. The ligands N4TTD-N4TTD4
(1.Og; 3.9 mmol) were
dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) and cooled at 0C. Lithium aluminum hydride (corresponding to the
ligands) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) was stirred for about 10 hrs in an ice bath. The reaction mixture was
stirred under reflux for 72 hrs. After cooling it, 20 mL of water and 10 mL of 15% sodium hydroxide were
added to the reaction mixture at 0C. The solid material was filtered and the residue was washed with
tetrahydrofuran. The filtrate and the tetrahydrofuran washings were concentrated under the reduced pressure:
Synthesis of the Complexes
The reaction was carried out in 1 1 molar ratio. 0.9-0.8 g; 4.5-5.0 mmol ligands, N4TTDS-N4TTD were
dissolved in methanol (50 mL). The reaction was followed by the addition of Mn(CH3COO)2.4H20
(corresponding to the ligands NaTTDS-N4TTD8) solution. The resulting mixture was stirred for 12 hours at
0C. The solid product was filtered off and washed with the same solvent and dried in vacuo. The products
were recrystallized from benzene. Thus a series of 14-18 membered tetraazamacrocyclic ligands and their
complexes were derived by the condensation of dicarboxylic acids with primary diamines in the presence of
condensing reagents DCHC and DMAP.
Analytical Methods and Physical Measurements:
Conductivity measurements of 103M solutions were made with a Systronic-Model 305 conductivity
bridge in dry dimethylformamide at room temperature (28C). Molecular weights were determined by the
Rast Camphor Method. IR spectra were obtained as KBr pellets on a Perkin-Elmer 577 grating
spectrophotometer in the range 4000-200 cm1
and far IR spectra were also recorded on the same spectro-
photometer in Nujol Mulls using Csl cell. Electronic spectra in dimethylsulphoxidc were recorded on a
Hitachi W-2000 spectrophotometer. Magnetic moment of the complexes were determined by Gouy's method
at room temperature. The mass spectrum was recorded on a Jeol SX 102/DA-6000 mass spectrometer/data
system using Argon/Xenon (6 kV, 10mA). m-Nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) was used as the matrix. The
accelerating voltage was 10 kV and the spectrum was recorded at the room temperature with the courtesy of
the Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow. The X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed
on the Philips P.W. 1840 automatic diffractometer using Fe(Kct) target with Mg filter. The wavelength used
was 1.9373 A and the reflection from 5.-65 was recorded. Manganese was estimated gravimetrically.
Carbon and hydrogen analyses were performed at the Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The resulting new macrocyclic complexes are white or brown solids having sharp melting points. These
arc soluble in most of the organic solvents. The conductivity measured for 10-3
M solution in anhydrous
DMF arc in the range 9-29 ohm

The first feature of all the complexes is the absence of NH2 stretching vibrations of the amine and -OH
groups of the dicarboxylic acids implying their involvement in the formulation of tetraamidemacrocycles. A
single sharp band observed for the ligands N4TTD-N4TTD4
in the region 3280-3292 cm
-may be assigned to
v(N-H) of amide group. The amide I, amide II, amide III, and amide IV groups are present at 1650-1675,
1540-1580, 1250-1260 and 630-645 cm-,respectively/17/. It provides a strong evidence for the presence of
a closed cyclic product. Strong and sharp absorption bands appeared in the regions 2820-3055 and 1415-1475
-!
cm in all the complexes are assigned to C-H stretching and C-H bending vibrational modes, respectively
/18/. It has been noticed that tetraazamacrocycles N4TTDS-N4TTD do not show amide bands corresponding
to the tetraamide macrocycles. However, a slight negative shift in the NH stretching vibration has been
observed. None of the other bands show any appreciable changes.
In the spectra of the macrocyclic complexes [Mn(CH3COO)2(NaTTDS)] [Mn(CH3COO)z(N4TTDS)] as
compared to their tetraazamacrocycles, the slight negative shift in the v(N-H) band which appeared in the
region 3200-3225 cm was noticed. It is ascribed to the coordinated N-H stretching vibration. This is further
substantiated by the fact that all the complexes show a medium intensity band in the region 425-432 cm
-which is attributed to the Mn-N stretching vibrations /19/. The IR spectral data of the ligands and their
corresponding manganse(II) complexes are listed in Table 2.

Antimicrobial Assay
The antifungal activities were evaluated against Collectatrichum capsici, Penicillium notatum and
Sceleratium rolfsii by the Radial Growth Method/21/using Czapek's agar medium. The compounds were
dissolved in 50, 100 and 200 ppm concentrations in methanol and then mixed with the medium. The linear
growth of the fungus was determined by measuring the diameter of the colony after 96 hours. The percentage
inhibition was calculated as 100 (dc-dt)/dc, where dc and dt are the diameters of the fungus colony in the
control and test plates, respectively.
Bacterial activities were evaluated by the Inhibition Zone Technique /23/. The organism used were
Escherichia coli (-), Staphylococcus aureous (+) and Klebsiella aerogenous (-). The nutrient agar medium
(Peptone, Beef extract, NaC1 and Agar-Agar and 5 mm diameter paper discs, (Whatman No. 1) filter paper
were used. The compounds were dissolved in methanol in 500 and 1000 ppm concentrations. The filter paper
discs were soaked in these solutions of the compounds, dried and then placed in the petriplates previously
seeded with the test organism. The petridishes were stored in an incubator at 30 + C for 24 hours. The zone
of inhibition thus formed around each disc containing the test compound was measured accurately.
Mode ofAction
Potato dextrose media (PDA) rich in carbohydrates as the nutrient source is utilized by the microbes with
the help of various enzymes. Metal based fungicides inhibit a wide range of enzymes involved in various
metabolic pathways and ultimately causing the cell death. Early work on the mode of action of the fungicides
showed that these compounds inhibit cell division. It was later shown that the specific site of the action is
-tubuline, a polymeric protein found in microtubules-essential component of the cytoskeleton. Phenyl and
amine groups in the complexes effect nucleic acid synthesis and mitochondrial electron transport also. One
may then expect at least the following regulatory processes to be operative/24,25/.
(i) Carbon Catabolic Regulation
During the period of the rapid utilization of the carbon source, rapid utilization of the glucose or sucrose
in the secondary metabolic pathways leading to toxins would be repressed or the activity of these pathways
would be inhibited.
60 Nitrogen Catabolic Repression
Excessive levels of rapidly assimilated forms of nitrogen (e.g. ammonium ion) could repress the
formation of the enzymes concerned with the nitrogen transformation of the toxins intermediates.
(iii) Feed Back Regulation
As toxins accumulate they would, in some instances, limit their own biosynthesis by inhibiting the
activity of one or more enzymes earlier in their synthetic pathways.
169
Vol. 3, Nos. 3-4, 2005 Potentially Biodynamic Tetraaza Macrocycles and their
Manganese
(iv)Feed Back Regulation by Primary Precursors
Primary metabolites that are precursors of toxins could not act similarly by inhibiting the enzymes in the
primary pathways prior to where they branch off into secondary ones.
(v) Energy Charge Regulation
High phosphate levels could reduce the availability of high energy phosphate (i.e. ATP and ADP). This
would effectively inhibit a number of key reactions in primary metabolism, which, in turn, would cause a
reduction in the activity of the secondary pathways liked to the toxin production.
(vi)Induction
The addition of certain primary metabolites (termed effectors) could induce the formation of enzymes in
the secondary pathways leading to the toxin production. This effect would be aside from any function the
effectors might have as precursors of the toxins.
For these organisms, even at low concentrations the inhibition of the growth of the micro-organism was
found to be dependent on the concentration of the compounds. The results of biocidal activity have been
compared with the conventional fungicide, Bavistin and the conventional bactericide Streptomycin used as
standards. The results achieved from these studies have been listed in Tables 5 and 6, in which the antifungal
activity indicated that the complexes are more active than the ligands. The variation in the effectiveness of
the different biocidal agents against different organisms/26/depends on the impermeability of the cell. The
hydrocarbon tail functions as a lipophilic group /26/ to drive the compound through the semipermeable
membrane of the cell.
The striking feature seen in the bacterial activity is the remarkable potential of the toxicity, for the gram
(+) stain as compared to the gram (-) stain. The reason is the difference in the structure of the cell walls. The
walls of the gram (-) cells are more complexes than those of the gram (+) cells. Over all, the results were
appreciable when compared with a standard. The bioactivity increased on undergoing complexation but did
not reach the efficacy of the standard at lower concentration. However, at higher ppm concentration the
results achieved were satisfactory. The aforesaid studies are clearly worthy of further investigation.
PercentDisease Control
In this method compounds were tested in the field for controlling the disease caused by the causal

The fungus Alternaria alternata and brinjal plants were used for this purpose. The efficacy of
tetraamidemacrocyclic ligands and their manganese complexes under in vitro condition and in the field
condition was studied. The field experiments were laid out in randomized block design with three
replications. The brinjal plants were raised in each plot. Compounds with a standard fungicide, Bavistin was
tried in addition to check water spray.
Thirty days after sowing, the plants were inoculated artificially by spraying the conidial suspension. The
conidial was prepared by crushing infected leaves in water. The inoculation was done in the evening. The
first spray of the respective fungicide was given when lesions were first seen and were repeated after 10 days.
Disease intensity was recorded 10 days alter the second spray. The data were analysed statistically and
disease control (%) was worked out (Table 7).

Antifertility Activity
Healthy, adult male albino rats of the Sprague Dawley strain were used in the present investigations. The
rats were divided into five groups containing seven animals each. The first group (A) served as vehicle (olive
oil) treated control. In the group (B), ligand N4TTD and group (D), ligand NnTTD4
25 mg kg body weight
suspended in 0.2 mL olive oil and given orally for a period of 60 days. The animals of group (C) and (E)
received the same dose of the compounds [Mn(N4TTD2)CH-3COO)] and [Mn(NaTTDn)CH3COO)2],
respectively for the similar period. These animals were screened for fertility test and autopsied for
determinatin of detailed biochemical studies. Reproductive organs were excised, blotted free of blood,
weighed and were frozen for biochemical estimations. The sperm motility and density of cauda epididymal
spermatozoa, total protein, sialic acid, fructose and acid phosphate were determined by the standard
laboratory techniques.
All the values of the body weight, organ weights, sperm dynamics and biochemical estimations were
averaged, standard error of mean values were calculated and student's 't' test was applied for standard
comparison/27/.
(a) Body and Organ Weights
Administration of the complexes did not bring about any significant change in the body weights of the
treated rats. The weights of testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate were decreased
significantly (Table 8) in all experimental groups when compared with vehicle treated controls.
(b) Sperm Motility and Sperm Density
A significant (P < 0.001) decline in the sperm motility, sperm density in testes and cauda epididymis was
noticed in the rats treated with the ligands and their complexes (Table 9).
(c) Biochemical Events Leading to Infertility
Protein
Protein contents of testes, epididymis, ventral prostate and seminal vesicle were reduced after the
treatment of ligands their complexes with rats (Table 10).
Fructose
Fructose content of seminal vesicle was decreased in ligands and their complexes (Table 10).
Sialic Acid
Sialic acid contents of the testes, epididymis and auxiliary glands (seminal vesicle and ventral prostate)
were depleted significantly in all experimental groups (Table 11).
Cholesterol
A significant increase in testicular cholesterol (P<0.05) content was recorded in rats treated with ligands
and their complexes (Table 11).

Acid Phosphate
Acid phosphate activities in testes, epididymis and ventral prostate of rats revealed a significant (P <
0.05) decrease, following the treatment of ligands and their Mn(II), complexes.
The present study evaluated the effects of tetraamide ligands and their Mn(II) complexes on reproductive
functions of the rats:- They caused a significant decrease in the sperm motility and density. Sperm motility
and fertilizing capacity of spermatozoa were affected severely, which could be due to the androgen
deficiency/28/.

Manganese
The Mn(II) complexes caused reduction in the weight of the accessory sex organs which indicates the
atrophy of glandular tissue and also reduction in the secretion ability, thus reflecting the decreased levels of
the testosterone[29]. Decreased contents of the protein[30] in the treated rats could be due to the androgen
deprivation. The sialic acid contents of the testes and accessory organs which were reduced in manganese
complex treated rats also support the androgen depletion[31].
Present study suggests that the complex [Mn(CH3COO)2(TTD4)] is more effective fertility inhibitor in male
rats and it is due to the synergistic action of the Mn(II) moiety.
