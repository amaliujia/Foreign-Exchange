INTRODUCTION
A large number of antimony(III) compounds have been tested as bactericides
[] and fungicides []. The pharmacological activity of antimony
compounds has been developed ever since the advent of rational
chemotherapy [, ]. A large number of antimony compounds have
been found to be most effective against various diseases
[, ]. Early studies sought to develop
this element as anticancer compound with the current reports of
the in vitro cancer properties of diphenylantimony
compounds [, ]. Phenothiazine and related compounds
containing −SC6H4N− moiety are well
known to affect the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and thus
resulting in a delay in ovulation and menstruation in women
[]. Such type of effects were also observed in rats and dogs
[, ]. The rate of implantation was lowered and the
reduction in litter size has been reported as a result of exposure
to some phenothiazine derivatives [, ]. Two compounds of
benzothiazoline derived from 2-aminothiophenol and β-diketone with antimony(III) [] and aluminium
[] have been tested for antifertility in male rats and were
found to show significant antifertility activity.

No comparison of antifertility of benzothiazoline ligand with its
metal derivative has been reported so far.

In view of this, we were prompted to synthesize, characterize, and
carry out the antifertility activity of ligand derived from aroyl
pyruvate and 2-aminothiophenol and their organoantimony(V)
derivative. In the present paper, we are reporting the synthesis,
characterization, and antifertility activity of these compounds.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of compound 1
The benzothiazoline 
                                   1 has been synthesized [] by the equimolar
condensation of aroyl pyruvate
C6H5C(O)CH : C(OH)COOCH3 [] with
2-aminothiophenol. This compound has been used for the preparation
of organoantimony(V) derivative
.

Synthesis of compound 2
A weighed amount of sodium metal (0.26 g, 11.31 mM) was
added to ∼ 20 ml of well-dried isopropanol and the
mixture was stirred for ∼ 1 hour. A benzene solution of
Ph3SbBr2
(2.90 g, 5.65 mM)
 was added to it. The reaction mixture was refluxed for about one hour. Sodium
bromide precipitated during the reaction was filtered off and the
removal of excess solvent from the filtrate at reduced pressure
yielded a solid Ph3Sb(OPri)2.

A benzene solution of Ph3Sb(OPri)2 was added to benzene solution of the ligand

 (1.77 g, 5.65 mM). This reaction
mixture was refluxed for ∼ 5 hours on a fractionating
column. The isopropanol liberated during the course of the
reaction was fractionated and estimated periodically [] to
monitor the progress as well as completion of reaction. Then, the
excess amount of the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to
afford a coloured, viscous compound. For purification, this
compound was dissolved in minimum amount of benzene and then pet
ether (40–60°C) was added to it till a viscous compound
begins to separate. The mixture was placed at −10°C
overnight. After decanting off the solvent, a viscous compound was
obtained which was finally dried under vacuum. The compound was
analyzed [] to give 
N = 2.07; S = 4.78%,
calc for C35H28NO3SSb; N = 2.11; S = 4.83%. Molecular weight of this compound has been
determined (found 642; calc 664) ebullioscopically in benzene
solution using Beckman's thermometer.

Proven-fertile male albino rats of the Wistar strain, weighing
150–185 g (90–100 days old), were used. They were housed in
steal cages and maintained under standard conditions (12 h
light/12 h dark; 25 ± 3°C; 35%–60%
relative humidity). Rat feed (Ashirwad Industries Ltd,
Chandigarh, India) and water were provided ad libitum.

The protocol of the experiments is outlined in
. Body weights of treated rats were taken
weekly to ensure their well-being. The rats were cohabitated with
proestrous females in 1 : 2 ratio to assess the fertility test by
natural mating. The mating exposure tests
of compounds 1 and 2 treated animals were performed before and on the 55th
day of treatment. Presence of spermatozoa in vaginal smear of the
cohabitated females was used as an evidence of mating. On the 16th
day laparotomy was performed to note the implantation sites, then
females were allowed to complete the term. The number of litters
delivered was recorded. Treated animals were anesthetized on the
61st day with solvent ether and their testes, epididymides,
ventral prostate, seminal vesicle were dissected out and weighed.
Sperm motility in cauda epididymides and sperm density in testes
and cauda epididymides were assessed []. Blood and serum of
experimental rats were analyzed for various parameters
() 
[–]. The protein, sialic acid,
glycogen, fructose, and cholesterol were estimated in testes,
epididymides, and accessory sex organs [–].
Remaining tissues were fixed in Bouin's fluid. Paraffin sections
were made and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Diameters of
seminiferous tubules were measured by using the “camera lucida.”
The cell population dynamics was studied for each cell type per
crosstubular section. Various testicular cell components were
quantitatively analyzed using spherically appearing sections.
Abercrombie's correcting factor was introduced []. Results
were analyzed statistically using Student's “t” test.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Benzothiazoline ligand

has been synthesized by the reaction of aroyl pyruvate with
2-aminothiophenol in 1 : 1 molar ratio:


The water liberated during the course of reaction was
 removed azeotropically with benzene.  This yellow
viscous compound was purified by vacuum distillation
(108–111°C, 0.1 atm). The spectroscopic [IR, NMR (1H and 13C)]
characterization [] indicates the presence of
benzothiazoline ring and in contrast to the benzothiazolines,
 derived from the simple
β-diketone, enolization of pyruvate residue also takes
place due to the hydrogen bonding of enolic OH group with oxygen
of ester group, due to which this ligand behaves as bifunctional
tridentate ligand during the complexation. The above structure
() has been proposed on the basis of these
evidences.

Reaction of this ligand has been carried out with
Ph3Sb(OPri)2 which was prepared by the reaction of NaOPri and Ph3SbBr2
 in 2 : 1 molar ratio [] in benzene:


This compound, which is viscous dark yellow liquid has been
characterized by elemental analysis and probable
structure has been proposed on the basis of IR and NMR
(1H and 13C) spectral evidences.

Spectral studies
IR spectrum
A comparative study of the IR spectrum of
compound 2 with that of free ligand (compound 1) shows disappearance of νNH and νOH absorption bands which were observed as broadband at
3252–3420 cm−1 and 3421–3630 cm−1,
respectively, in the spectrum of compound 1. The
presence of νC=N, νSb−S [], and
νSb ← N [] absorption bands at 1606, 425,
and 390 cm−1 in the spectrum of compound 2 indicates the rearrangement of benzothiazoline ring and subsequent
formation of Sb ← N and Sb−S bonds. Deprotonation of OH group during complexation is also
supported by the presence of νSb−O [] absorption band observed at 755 cm−1 in the spectrum of compound 2. The νSb−C mode of vibrations
appears in the range 449–472 cm−1 in the spectrum of
compound 2.

1H NMR spectrum
The signals observed at δ 4.01 ppm and δ 15.1 ppm in the spectrum of free ligand, which have been
assigned to NH and OH groups, are found to be absent
in the spectrum of compound 2. Disappearance of these
signals indicates the deprotonation of these groups during 
complexation. The =CH
 and CH3 (ester) group
protons have been observed as singlet at δ 8.67 ppm and
δ 2.30 ppm, respectively. The phenylene and phenyl ring
protons appear as complex pattern in the range δ 7.11–7.94 ppm.

13C NMR spectrum
The comparison of the 13C NMR spectrum of compound
1 with 2 reveals some useful information
about the mode of bonding as well as the geometry of compound
2. The signal observed at δ 158.68 ppm in
the spectrum of compound 1 which has been
 assigned to CN−R group shows downfield shift on
complexation. This signal which appears at δ 162.97 ppm in the spectrum of compound 2
indicates the rearrangement of  benzothiazoline
ring during complex formation and subsequent formation of Schiff
base derivative with the formation of Sb ← N and Sb−S bonds. Downfield shift in the position of
C1 and C2 carbon signals of
−NC6H4S− group which are appeared at
δ 153.52 ppm and δ 136.7 ppm, respectively,
further supports the formation of Sb ← N and
Sb−S bonds. The signals of &gt;C=O and
=CH groups which appeared at δ 166.78 ppm and
δ 97.78 ppm in the spectrum of 1 also show a
downfield shift on complexation indicating the participation of
&gt;C−O group in bonding. The signals observed at δ
25.76 ppm and δ
 196.96 ppm have been assigned to
CH3 (ester) and &gt;C=O (ester) groups,
respectively. The −NC6H4S−
 group carbon signals appear in the range δ
121.79–153.52 ppm. A new set of four signals which appeared
in the range δ 127.73–152.37 ppm has been assigned to
phenyl ring carbons attached to the central antimony atom. The
signals for phenyl ring carbons of the ligand moiety of compound
2 have been observed in the range δ 126.01–133.73 ppm.

On the basis of above evidences, the above structure
() may be tentatively proposed to compound
2.

The treatment of compounds 1 and
2 did not affect the body weights of treated animals.
 During the study, all the treated animals showed the normal behaviour
and they were healthy in appearance. However, a
significant (P &lt; .001) reduction was observed in the
weights of testes, epididymides, and accessory sex organs (seminal
vesicles and ventral prostate) in rats treated with compounds
1 and 2 than those of the control group.
This reduction was more significant (P &lt; .01) in animals treated
with compound 2 as compared to compound 1 treated rats (). Reduction in reproductive
organ weights indicates the low level of androgen. The structural
and functional integrities of male reproductive organs are
androgen dependent and their weights are used as an index of
androgen status of animal [].

The number of spermatozoa in testes and cauda epididymides
was decreased significantly (P &lt; .001). Sperm count is
considered to be one of the important factors that affect
fertility. Low sperm concentration is associated with low
fertility. This may be related to decreased testicular size, which
may be caused by androgen deprivation []. Sperm must be motile to penetrate through the curvival mucus and to migrate
through the female genital tract to the site of fertilization.
Thus, sperm motility is one of the most important predictors of
sperm fertilizing ability. In this investigation, the motility of
spermatozoa collected from cauda epididymides was hampered in both
compounds 1 and 2 treated groups as compared
to control group (). Sperm motility may be
affected by inhibition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by
uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and thus renders the
spermatozoa immotile []. Suppressed sperm motility and density can be causes of 100% infertility
().

A significant decline was noticed in seminiferous tubular diameter
following the administration of compounds 1 and
2. This reflects the tubular shrinkage
(),  which may be due to cell death or
sloughing of epithelial cells []. The number of
spermatogonia was decreased by 24.53%, 49.86%;
preleptotene spermatocytes by 36.57%, 57.23%; pachytene
spermatocytes by 40.06%, 62.01%, and secondary spermatocytes
by 52.45%, 63.22% in compounds 1 and 2 treated animals, respectively (Figures  and
). Sertoli cells perform crucial functions that initiate and maintain spermatogenesis. In these experiments
the number of Sertoli cells was decreased significantly (P &lt; .001)
(). The decreased number of Sertoli cells may
affect the progression of spermatogenesis. This may suggest that
spermatogenesis was sluggishly arrested at primary spermatocyte
stage.

The treatment of compounds 1 and 2 brought
about the alteration in biochemical parameters. The reduction of
protein contents in reproductive organs may reflect the alteration
in testicular function []. The structural integrity of acrosomal membrane is dependent upon sialic acid and due to
alteration in its content, the motility and fertilizing capacity
of sperm may also be affected [, ]. Testicular
glycogen was found to be decreased at a significant
(P &lt; .001) level, it may be correlated to diminished postmeiotic
germ cells (secondary spermatocytes and spermatids) which are the
site of glucose metabolism []. The fructose content of the
seminal vesicle was decreased significantly ()
(P &lt; .001). It may be suggested that these compounds hamper the glycolitic metabolism of spermatozoa resulting in abnormal sperm
function []. The significant (P &lt; .001) elevation in concentration of testicular cholesterol () may indirectly indicate the reduced level of circulating testosterone
and thus impairment of spermatogenesis takes place []. As far as general metabolism and functioning of vital organs are
concerned, all the biochemical parameters (serum and blood) are
found within normal range as compared to their control group
(). Our results revealed that both compounds are
able to produce antifertility activities in male rats, however,
compound 2 is more potent than compound 1,
pertaining to the reproductive organ weight loss, sperm dynamics,
and testicular cell population dynamics. The effect of metal
derivatives on antifertility activity has been studied
[, ]. In the present investigation, we studied the effect
of antimony(V) derivative, derived from metalation of compound
1, on antifertility activity which has
a more positive effect than compound 1 on male reproductive
organs. Similar effects of metal salts on
antifertility have been reported earlier [, , , ].
