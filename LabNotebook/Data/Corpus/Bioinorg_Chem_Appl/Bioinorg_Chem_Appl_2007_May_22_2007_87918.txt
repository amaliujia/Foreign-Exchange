1. INTRODUCTION
The chemistry of transition metal complexes containing
heterocyclic thione donors continues to be of interest on account of their
interesting structural features and also because of their biological importance
[–]. The combination of the exocyclic thione/thiol group
and the heterocyclic molecule, which may contain nitrogen, oxygen, or sulphur
or a combination thereof, generates a group of molecules with considerable
coordination potential [–]. The coordination behavior of such molecule depends
upon reaction conditions, nature of metal ion, and pH of the medium. The
stimulus for much of the research into the coordination chemistry of
heterocyclic thione/thiol donors status from their wide ranging applications
[–], viz., in analytical
chemistry, in metal finishing, and electroplating industries uses as polyolefin
stabilizers and as vulcanization accelerators. Fungicidal, insecticidal, and
acaricidal activities have also been reported. Other biological applications
include thyrotoxic activity; centred nervous system depressant and a platinum
pyridine thione complex have been patented for clinical use in cancer treatment
[–]. However, so far no report
is available on the coordination behavior of bis(mercaptoazoles).

In this paper, we describe the synthesis,
characterization, antifungal, and antibacterial studies on
titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV) derivatives containing three im-portant
series of bis(mercaptoazoles) viz., bis(mercaptotriazoles) (I),
bis(mercaptooxadiazoles) (II), and bis(mercaptothiadiazoles) (III) as coligands
alongwith cyclopentadienyl group. The structures of
ligands, used for the present study, are shown in Schemes , , and .

2. EXPERIMENTAL
All manipulations were performed under anhydrous conditions
under a dry O2 free N2 atmosphere. Extreme precautions were taken to exclude
moisture. Tetrahydrofuran was dried by distilling it over sodiumwire or pieces. Bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV) dichloride was purchased from Aldrich chemical Co. (Wis, USA) The ligands were prepared as
reported in the literature []. The details of analytical methods and physical
measurements were the same described earlier [].

The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the
paper-disc plate method []. The nutrient agaz medium (peptone, NaCl, and agar)
and 5mm diameter paper discs of Whatman No. 1 were used. The filter paper discs
were soaked in different solutions of the compounds, dried and then placed in
the petriplates previously seeded with the test 
organism (Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli). The plates were
incubated for 24 hours at 30 ± 1°C and the inhibition around each disc was measured in mm.

2.1. Preparation of complexes
To a solution of  bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV), chloride (20 mmol)
in dry tetrahydrofuran (∼40 cm3) was added appropriate
bis(mercapto-triazole/oxadiazole/thiadiazole) (10 mmol). To the resulting solution, dry n-butylamine
(20 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for several hours at room temperature. n-butylamine
hydrochloride remains soluble in tetrahydrofuran. The colored precipitate, thus
obtained, was thoroughly washed with tetrahydrofuran and dried in vacuo.

For the sake of brevity, the details of all reactions
along with physical characteristics and analytical data of the products are
given in .

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium
(IV) chloride reacts with bis(mercaptoazoles) (LH2) viz., bis(mercaptotriazoles), bis(mercaptooxadiazoles), or bis(mercaptothiadiazoles)
in 2 : 1 molar ratio,
respectively, in dry tetrahydrofuran in the presence of n-butylamine
to give binuclear products of type [{(η5 -C5H5)2MCl}2(L)],
according to the following equation:
LH2 is equal to
1,2-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-triazole-2-yl)phenyl (MTPH2);
1,2-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-triazole-2-yl)ethane (MTEH2);
1,4-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-triazole-2-yl)butane (MTBH2); 
1,2-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl)phenyl (MOPH2); 1,2-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl)ethane (MOEH2);
1,4-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl)butane (MOBH2);
1,2-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiodiazole-2-yl)phenyl (MThPH2);
1,2-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-yl) ethane (MThEH2);
1,4-bis(5-mercapto-1,3,4-Thiadiazole-2-yl)butane (MThBH2).

The physical properties and the analytical data of the
complexes are given in . The molecular weights of few complexes, as
obtained from ion peak in FAB-mass spectra, are also given in . The
complexes are colored solids and are soluble in dimethylformamide and dimethyl
sulphoxide. These complexes have high decomposition temperature and do not
decompose up to 250°C. The
electrical conductance measurements in dimethylformamide are consistent with
their nonelectrolytic nature. Magnetic susceptibility values at room
temperature show their diamagnetic nature.

3.1. Electronic spectra
The electronic spectra of complexes, recorded in
dimethylformamide, show a single band in the region 22 800–24 000cm−1 which can be assigned [] to the
charge-transfer bond. In addition, the ligand and the complexes show band
around 32 000cm , which is assigned to π → π* transition of the azomethine linkage.

3.2. Infrared spectra
The important infrared spectra of the ligands,
mercapto azoles, and their corresponding titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV)
derivatives are given in . The assignments of i.r. spectral ligand bands
and the complexes are based on earlier studies of similar ligand [–]. All complexes show bands
at ca. 3000 cm−1 , 1420 cm−1 , and 1020 cm−1 indicating the presence of
cyclopentadienyl ring attached to titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV) ion.
All these bonds are similar to those reported [] for
bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium (IV) chloride. The
appearance of these bands for cyclopentadienyl ring indicates that (η5 -C5H5)
group remains in the complexes. The infrared spectra of bis(mercaptotriazoles),
bis(mercaptooxadiazoles), and bis(mercaptothiadiazoles) show one weak band at
2480–2550 cm−1 due to the −SH group vibration.
However, in the spectra of complexes, this band disappears indicating the
coordination through sulphur after deprotonation. This is further supported
[] by the appearance
of band at ca. 340–380 cm−1, assignable to ν (M−S). A
strong band in the region of 1585–1560 cm−1 in the ligands is
characteristics []
of ν(C=N)
ring group. However, in the complexes the ν(C=N)
band is found to split in two; where one band is located almost at the original
position, that is, at ca. 1580 cm−1 due to uncoordinated ν(C=N) and
other is shifted to lower frequency (∼ 20–25cm−1) arising from the coordinated (C=N)
mode. The splitting of ν (C=N)
absorption band suggests that only one nitrogen from each unit of
mercaptotriazole, mercaptooxadiazole, and mercaptothiadiazole is involved in
coordination. The bands observed at 410–440 cm−1 may be assigned to ν (M−N).
The infrared spectra of bis(mercaptotriazoles) show one band at 3150 cm−1 assignable [] to ν (N−H).
The bands due to ν (C−O−C) in
bis(mercaptooxadiazoles) appear at ca. 1290 cm−1 (symmetric) and 1350 cm−1 (asymmetric); while
bis(mercaptothiadiazoles) show band at ca. 660–650 due to ν(C−S).
The position of infrared bands due to phenyl and heterocyclic (triazole,
oxadiazole, or thiadiazole) ring does not change in the complexes indicating
the noncoordination of nitrogen (triazole ring), oxygen (oxadiazole ring), or
sulphur (thiadiazole ring) atoms.

Thus, the infrared spectra reflect that all
bis(mercaptoazoles), that is, bis(mercaptotriazoles), bis(mercaptooxadiazoles),
and bis(mercaptothiadiazoles) act as dibasic, tetradentate chelating agents
coordinating through two thiol sulphur atoms and two ring azomethine nitrogen atoms.

1H NMR spectra
The proton magnetic resonance spectra of ligands and
their corresponding bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV)
derivatives were recorded () in DMSO–d6. The intensities of all the
resonance lines were determined by planimetric integration. The following conclusions can be derived by comparing the spectra of ligands and their corresponding derivatives.


The signal due to –SH proton appears at ca. δ 8.8–9.0 in the ligands which disappears in the corresponding bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/hafnium(IV) derivatives.

A signal in all the derivatives at δ 6.58–6.72 may be assigned to the protons of the cyclopentadienyl rings. The appearance of single, sharp signal for cyclopentadienyl ring indicates that there is rapid rotation of the cyclopentadienyl ring around the metal ring axis.


		

13C NMR spectra
The 13C NMR spectra of ligands and the
corresponding complexes were recorded in DMSO. The 13C resonance signals are assigned according to chemical shift theory. The C5H5 rings give rise to one resonance at ca. δ 115.0. The
considerable shift in the position of carbons (attached with mercapto group in
the ligands; δ 150–160)
indicates the coordination through mercapto group.

Thus, on the basis of elemental analysis, electrical
conductance and spectral data, the following structures (IV) are tentatively proposed for titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV)/ hafnium(IV) complexes. Proposed binuclear structure has also been confirmed by FAB mass spectra of few complexes of each series.

Attempts are being made to grow single crystal of the
complexes suitable for X-ray studies but so far no success has been achieved.

3.3. Antifungal activity
The fungicidal activity of the ligands and their
corresponding complexes were evaluated in DMF against Aspergillus niger,
Aspergillus fumigate, and Helminothosporim oryzae by the agar plate
technique at 1000, 100, and 10 ppm concentration with triplicate determination
in each case. The average percentage inhibition was calculated using the
expression: (%) = 100(C−T)/C where C and T are the diameters of the fungus
colony in control and test plates, respectively. The recorded results ()
lead to the following conclusions.


The compounds
show significant toxicity at 1000ppm concentration against all species of
fungi. However, the complexes are more toxic than ligands, which may be owing
to the chelation and the presence of sulphur atom.

The activity decreases on detection.

Titanium complexes show better activity than zirconium and hafnium complexes. Zirconium and hafnium complexes show almost similar results. This may be due to similar
radius of zirconium and hafnium.

For a particular metal, the complexes with bis(mercaptothiadiazoles) show better
activity.

For a particular series of ligands, the compounds with R = C6H4 show better activity as compared to R = −CH2−CH2− or −(CH2)4.




The variation in the effectiveness of different biocidal agents against different organisms
[] depends upon the
permeability of the cells or differences in ribosomes of antimicrobial agent.

3.4. Antibacterial activity
The antibacterial activity of the complexes together
with the parent ligands has been screened against Gram-positive Bascillus
subtilis and Gram-negative Eschericlia coli at 1000pm concentration.
The results () show that activity increases on chelation. The activity
of the ligands is affected by the nature of substituents; this in relation to
the lipophilicity of the ligands and their membrane permeability, a key factor
in determining the entry inside the cell. The results lead to the following
conclusions.


The complexes
are slightly more toxic than the parent ligands.

The titanium
complexes show better activity than zirconium and hafnium complexes.

The ligands
bis(mercaptothiadiazoles) and their complexes show slightly better activity
than bis(mercaptotriazoles) and their derivatives which in turn show slightly
better activity than bis(mercaptooxadiazoles) and their derivatives.

The presence of
phenyl ring at R increases the antibacterial activity.
