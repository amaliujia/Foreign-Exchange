Abstract
A novel triphenyltin(IV) derivative of 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (Hzmna) of formula
{[(C6Hs)3Sn]E(mna)'[(CH3)2CO]} (1) has been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis and
13C-NMR, and FT-IR spectroscopic techniques. The crystal structure of complex (1) has been determined by
single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis at 173(1) K. Compound (1) contains two triphenyltin moieties linked
by a doubly de-protonated 2,mercaptonicotinic acid (HEmna). It is an example of a pentacoordinated
Ph3SnXY system with an axial-equatorial arrangement ofthe phenyl groups at Sn(1). Compound (1), exhibits
potent, in vitro, cytotoxicity against sarcoma cancer cells (mesenchymal tissue) from the Wistar rat,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, benzo[a]pyrene) carcinogenesis.
Keywords: triphenyltin(IV) compound, S ligands-heterocyclic thioamides, mercaptonicotinic acid, crystal
structures.
In the course of our work on the synthesis and structure of organotin(IV) complexes derived from
heterocyclic thioamides we have studied the reactions of 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (Hzmna) (a multi-dentate
ligand) (Scheme 1) with triphenyltin chloride. The triphenyltin group was chosen, since it is known to confer
biological (fungicidal and acaricidal)properties on the resulting compounds/1/.

In this paper we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel triphenyltin(IV) complex with the
heterocyclic thioamide 2-mercaptonicotinic acid (Hzmna) of formula {[(C6Hs)3Sn]2(mna)'[(CH3)2CO]} (1).
Crystal structure ofcomplex (1) has been determined by X-ray diffraction at 173(1) K.
Complex (1) has been synthesized by reacting a methanolic solution of triphenyltin chloride Ph3SnCI with
an aqueous solution of 2-mercapto-nicotinic acid (Hzmna) which contains a twofold amount of potassium
hydroxide. The structure was solwd by direct methods SHELXS97/2a/and successive difference Fourier
syntheses. Refinement applied full-matrix least-squares methods SHELXL97/2b/. Atomic scattering factors
for neutral atoms and real and imaginary dispersion terms were taken from International Tables for X-ray
Crystallography /2c/. Intensity data for the colourless crystals were collected on a Nonius KappaCCD
diffractometer with graphite-monochromated MoKcz radiation at 173 K. C45H39NO3SSn2, MW 911.21,

have been carried out in preliminary repetitions according to the method described in literature/3/.
The ir spectrum of complex (1) shows distinct absorptions at 1556 and 1330 cm,which are assigned to
v(CN) vibrations (thioamide and II bands) and at 1073 and 656 cm-, which are attributed to the v(CS)
vibrations (thioamide III and IV bands). The corresponding thioamide and II bands in crystalline H2mna (2)
appear at 1562 and 1310 cm while thioamide bands IIl and IV are observed at 1071 and 650 cm-/4/.
A diagram ofcompound (1) as well as selected bond lengths and angles are shown in Figure 1.
The structure of compound (1) consists oftwo [Ph3Sn(IV)] moieties bridged by a doubly de-protonated 2-
mercaptonicotinic acid (Hzmna) molecule. The Sn(1) atom exhibits a distorted trigonal bipyramidal
configuration with C(11), C(31), and S(1) occupying the equatorial and N(1) and C(21) occupying the axial
positions. The distortion from the ideal trigonal bipyramidal geometry is manifested (i) in the N(1)-Sn(1)-
C(21) angle of 158.72(7) being the result of ligand constraint (four-membered Sn(1)-N(1)-C(1)-S(1) ring),
(ii) the displacement by 0.5181 A of Sn(1) from the plane defined by C(11), C(31) and S(1) (plane A), and
(iii) by the geometrical goodness /5/ A;(0) 29.3 reflecting the position along the path
tetrahedron(0)--trigonal bipyramid(90). The latter indicates the tin atom in compound to be almost
midway between both configurations. This is (i) in line with the Sn(1)-N(1) bond distance of 2.711(2) A
being 0.561 A longer than the covalent radii of nitrogen (0.75 A)/6/and tin (1.40 A)/6/and (ii) represents a
straightforward example for an intramolecular nucleophilic face-attack at a tetrahedral tin atom. As a
consequence, the Sn(1)-C(21) bond distance (the one becoming axial) of 2.160(2) A is slightly longer than

The Sn(2) atom also exhibits a distorted trigonal bipyramidal configuration (geometrical goodness/5/
AZ(0) 52.44) with C(41), C(51), and C(61) occupying the equatorial and O(1) and 0(3) occupying the
axial positions. The Sn(2) atom is displaced by 0.3683/ in direction of O(1) from the equatorial plane being
defined by C(41), C(51) and C(61) (plane B). The O(1)-Sn(2)-O(3) angle amounts to 176.23(6) and the
angle between planes A and B is 74.96.Moreover, according to Reedijk's geometric parameter (r =(13-a)/60)
/10/the calculated r values are 0.73 and 0.82 forS,n(1) and Sn(2) respectively, being equal to zero for
perfectly tetragonal pyramidal geometry and unity for perfectly trigonal pyramidal/10/.
The carboxylate group coordinates Sn(2) in an anisobidentate mode with Sn(2)-O(1)= 2.1149(15) and
Sn(2)-O(2) 2.7779(16) /. The acetone molecule is weakly coordinated to tin, with Sn(2)-O(3)=
2.7763(18) ).
