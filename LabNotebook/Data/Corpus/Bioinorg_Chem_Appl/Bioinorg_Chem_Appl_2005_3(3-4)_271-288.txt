ABSTRACT
We describe the synthesis and characterization of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) coordination compounds of
4[N-(furan-2'-aldimine)amino]antipyrine thiosemicarbazone (FFAAFFS) and 4[N-(4'-nitro-
benzalidene)amino]antipyrine thiosemicarbazone (4'-NO_BAAVFS). All the isolated compounds have the
general composition MX2(L)(H20) (M Coz+ or NiZ/; X C1, Br, NO3, NCS or CH3COO; L FFAAPTS or
4'-NO2BAAPTS) and M(C104)2(L)2 (M Co2+
or Ni2+; L FFAAPTS or 4'-NO2BAAFFS). Infrared spectral
studies indicate that both the thiosemicarbazones coordinate in their neutral form and they act as {N,N,S}
tridentate chelating ligands. Room temperature magnetic measurements and electronic spectral studies
suggest the distorted octahedral geometries of the prepared complexes. Thermogravimetric studies are also
reported and the possible structures of the complexes are proposed. Antibacterial and antifungal properties of
these metal-coordination compounds have also been studied.
Key Words: Cobalt(II), Nickel(II), Complexes, Thiosemicarbazone, Biological Activity.
INTRODUCTION
Of the sulfur donor ligands, thiosemicarbazones have perhaps not been given as much attention as
dithiophosphate /1/, dithiocarbamates /2,3/, dithiolates /4/, dithio-13-diketonates /5/, dithiooxamide /6/or

xanthates/3/. Although many thiosemicarbazones possess a wide spectrum of medicinal properties, including
activity against influenza/7/, protozoa/8/, smallpox/9/, certain kinds of tumor./lO/, tuberculosis/11/, leprosy
/12/, bacterial/13/and viral infections/14/, psoriasis/15/, rheumatism and tripamosomiasis/16/, cocidiosis
/17/, malaria/18/, and have been suggested as possible pesticides/19/and fungicides/20/, their activity has
frequently been thought to be due to their ability to chelate trace metals. Liebermeister /21/ showed that
copper ions enhance the antitubercular activity of p-acetamidobenzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone. Similarly,
Petering et al. /22/ showed that the active intermediate in the antitumour activity of 3-ethoxy-2-
oxobutyraldehyde bis-(thiosemicarbazone) (HzKTS) was the chelate Cu(KTS). These findings have
continuously led to an increased interest in the chemistry of metal chelates of thiosemicarbazones. A number
of review articles/23-28/have appeared on various metal-coordination complexes of thiosemicarbazones. In
recent years a number of workers have also reported some transition metal coordination complexes of
thiosemicarbazones./29-36/. Comparatively less is known about transition metal coordination complexes of
thiosemicarbazones having a pyrazolone ring. In view of this, in the present work we describe the synthesis,
spectral, magnetic, thermal and biological properties of Coz+ and Ni2/
complexes of 4 [N-(furan-2'-
aldimine)amino]antipyrine thiosemicarbazone (FFAAPTS) (1) and 4[N-(4'-nitrobenz-
alidene)amino]antipyrine thiosemicarbazone (4'-NOzBAAPTS) (II).

EXPERIMENTAL
MX2.nH20 (M Co2+
or Ni2+; X C1, Br, NO3 or CH3COO) were obtained from BDH and were used as
such. M(NCS)2 (M Co2+
or Ni2+) were prepared by mixing metal chloride (in ethanol) and ethanolic
solution of potassium thiocyanate in 1:2 molar ratio. Precipitated KC1 was filtered off and filtrate having
respective metal thiocyanate was used immediately for complex formation. M(C104)2 (M Co2+
or Ni2+)

were prepared by the addition of an ethanolic solution of sodium perchlorate into respective metal chloride
solutions. White precipitate of NaC1 was filtered off and the filtrate containing M(C104):z was used as such
for complex formation. Both the thiosemicarbazones ligands, i.e. FFAAPTS and 4'-NO2BAAPTS, were
synthesized in the laboratory as described previously/37/.
Synthesis of the complexes
Co+ complexes ofFFAAPTS or 4'-NO2BAAPTS
All the complexes were prepared by mixing ethanolic solution of ligand and metal salts in required molar
ratio (1:1/1:2 where both the ligands were in 10% excess). The reaction mixture was refluxed on a water bath
for 2-3 hrs and then concentrated to a small volume on a hot plate at ~50C. After cooling, desired crystals of
the complexes obtained were filtered, recrystallized and washed in the ethanol and dried in vacuum over
P4010
Ni2+
complexes ofFFAAPTS or 4'-NO2BAAPTS
A general method was used for the preparation of the complexes. A hot ethanolic solution of the
corresponding nickel(II) salt was mixed with a hot ethanolic solution of the respective ligand (in 1:1 or 1:2
molar ratios where both the ligands were in 10% excess). The reaction mixture was refluxed on a water bath
for ~2 hrs. On cooling at room temperature, the desired complexes were precipitated out in each case. They
were filtered, recrystallized, washed with ethanol and diethyl-ether and finally dried over P400 under
vacuum.
Physical measurements and analytical estimations
The cobalt(II) and nickel(II) in their metal complexes were estimated complexometrically with EDTA
using murexide and erichrome black-T as indicators respectively after decomposing the complexes with
conc. H2SO4 and H202 /38/. The halogens and pseudo halogens were estimated by Volhard's method/39/.
The perchlorate was estimated by the method suggested by Kurz et al. /40/. The percentage of sulfur was
estimated gravimetrically as BaSO4. The nitrogen content was determined by the Kjeldahl method.
The molecular weight of the complexes was determined in the laboratory cryoscopically in freezing
nitrobenzene using a Beckmann thermometer of +0.01C accuracy. The conductivity measurements were
carried out, at room temperature in nitrobenzene, using a conductivity bridge and dip type cell operated at
220 volts A.C. mains. The magnetic measurements on powder form of the complexes were carried out at
room temperature on Evans's balance using anhydrous copper(ll) sulfate as calibrant. The infrared spectra of
the complexes were recorded on a Perkin Elmer infrared spectrophotometer model Spectrum 1000 in CsI
pellets in the range of 4000-200 cm.Diffused reflectance spectra of the solid compounds were recorded on
a Beckmann DK-2A spectrophotometer at C.D.R.I, Lucknow, India. Thermogravimetric studies of the
complexes were carried out on Santon Red Craft Thermobalance Model TG-750 in static air with open
sample holder and a small boat, the heating rate was 6C/min.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reaction of Co2/
and Ni2/
with FFAAPTS and 4'-NO2BAAPTS yielded the MX2(L) (H20); [M = Co2+
or Ni2+; X C1, Br, NO3, NCS or CH3COO] and M(C104)2(L)2 [M Co2+
or Ni2+; L FFAAPTS or 4'-
NO2BAAPTS]. The analytical data of these complexes showed that the solids are stable and can be stored for
months without any significant change in their formulae. These complexes are generally soluble in common
organic solvents. The molar conductance values of the complexes in nitrobenzene reveal that the halo,
nitrato, isothiocyanato and acetato complexes are essentially non-electrolytes, while the perchlorato
complexes dissociate in nitrobenzene and behave as 1:2 electrolytes/41/. The cryoscopic molecular weights
and conductivity data are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The molecular weight results are in broad agreement
with the conductance data suggesting monomeric formulations.
Magnetic susceptibility
The magnetic measurements of the cobalt(II) complexes (4.8-5.4 BM) (Table 1) show that all are
paramagnetic and have three unpaired electrons indicating a high-spin octahedral configuration. The
paramagnetism observed for the present series of Ni2/
complexes ranges from 2.6-3.2 BM (Table-2), which is
consistent with the octahedral stereochemistry of these complexes.
Infrared spectra
A study and comparison of infrared spectra of both thiosemicarbazone ligands (FFAAPTS and 4'-
NO2BAAPTS) and their Co2+
and Ni2+
complexes (Tables 3-6) imply that these ligands behave as neutral
tridentate and the metals are coordinated through N and N of two azomethine groups and of S of thio-keto
group. The strong bands observed at 3440-3270 cm"1
region in both thiosemicarbazones have been observed
due to N-H vibrations. Practically no effect on these frequencies after complexation preclude the possibility
of complexation at this group. The absorptions at ~1600 cm"1
in free ligands may be attributed to C=N
stretching vibrations of imine-nitrogen which is in agreement with the previous observations[42,43]. On
complexation FFAAPTS and 4'-NO2BAAPTS with Co2+
and Ni2+
these frequencies are shifted to lower
energies (Tables 3-6). These observations suggest involvement of unsaturated nitrogen atoms of the two
azomethine groups in bonding with the metal ions.
In substituted thioureas, the C=S stretching vibrations contributed greatly to some other vibrations as C-
N stretching and bending as well as N-C-S bending modes/44/. In the spectra of the present ligands, the
bands observed in the region 1300-1125 cm", 1125-1095 cm" and 840-730 cm" regions are assigned to
[v(C=S)+v(C=N)+v(C-N)], 5(N-C-S) + 5(C=S) bending and v(C=S) stretching, respectively, which are in
line with the observations of previous researchers/45,46/. Coordination of sulfur with the metal ions results
in the displacement of electrons towards the latter, thus resulting in the weakening of C=S bond. Hence on
complexation C=S stretching vibrations should decrease and those of C-N should increase. In all the present
complexes of Co2+
and Ni2+
with FFAAPTS and 4'-NO2BAAPTS, frequencies in the range 1300-1125 cm"

increased by 50-60 cm"1. Similarly, bending modes of N-C-S and C=S also increased but to a lesser extent.
On the other hand, on eomplexation the frequencies in region 840-730 cm"1
were shifted to lower wave
numbers and intensity of the bands were also reduced. The changes described are not peculiar and they
suggest (C---S) coordination.
The possibility of thione-thiol tautomefism (H-N-C=S C=N-SH) in these ligands has been ruled
out for no bands around 2700-2500 em1, which is characteristic of thiol groups displayed in the infrared
absorption/47,48/. In the far infrared spectral region, some new bands with medium to weak intensity in
region 410-350 cm" were assigned to v(M-N) and v(M-S). Thus the infrared spectral suggested the
tridentate nature of the thiosemiearbazones and pointed out the N,N,S sites as possible donor atoms. In these
complexes, the presence of coordinated water was suggested by the very broad absorption centered around
3450 cm" in their infrared spectra. Bands at ~930 and 770 cm may be attributed to rocking and wagging
modes of the coordinated water/49,50/.
In all the perchlorato complexes, the presence of the v3 (1100-1080 cm") and v4 (625-620 cm") bands
showed that the Td symmetry of C104 is maintained in all the complexes. This suggested the presence of
C104" outside the coordination sphere in these complexes /51,52/. In thiocyanato complexes, the three
fundamental absorption C-N stretch (v1), C-S stretch (v3) and N-C-S bending (v2) were identified in regions
2045-2030, 845-840 and 475-460 cm" respectively. These frequencies are associated with the terminal N-
bonded isothiocyanate ions/53/.
In nitrato complexes, the infrared data indicated the occurrence of two strong absorption bands in 1560-
1520 cm"1
and 1310-1300 cm" regions, which were attributed to v4 and v modes of vibrations of the
ovalently bonded nitrate groups, respectively/54/. If the (v4-v) is taken as an approximate measure of the
covalency of nitrate group/55,56/, a value of ~220 cm" for these complexes suggested strong covalency for
the metal-nitrate bonding. Lever et al. /57/have shown that the number and relative energies of nitrate
combination frequencies (vl+v4) in the region 1800-1700 cm" of the infrared spectrum, may be used as an
aid to distinguish the various coordination modes of the nitrato group. Lever et al. /57/ have suggested that
bidentate coordination of the nitrato group involves a greater distortion from D3h symmetry than unidentate
coordination, therefore, bidentate nitrate groups should show a larger separation of (v+v4). After an
investigation of the spectra of a number of compounds of known crystal structure, Lever et aL /57/ showed
this to be tree; the separation for monodentate nitrate groups appeared to be 5-26 cm" and that for bidentate
groups 25-66 cm"1. In the present complexes, a separation of 15-25 crn" in the combination bands (v+v4) in
the 1800-1700 crn1
region concluded the monodentate nitrate coordination. In acetato complexes, the
vy,(COO') of free acetate ions are at ~1560 and 1415 cm"1
respectively. In the unidentate complex, v(C=O)
is higher than Vym(COO') and v(C-O) is lower than vsy,(COO'). As a result, the separation between the two
v(C-O) is much larger in unidentate complexes than free ion. The opposite trend is observed in the bidentate
complex, i.e. the separation between the v(C-O) is smaller than that of free ion in this case. In the bridging
complexes, however, two v(C-O) are closed to the free ion values. The present complexes showed infrared
absorption frequency bands corresponding to vym(COO) and vsym(COO) at ~1610 and 1370 cm",
respectively. These observations indicated that both the acetate groups in the present complexes are
unidentate/58,59/.

Electronic spectra
The electronic spectra of all the Coz/
complexes recorded were very similar to each other and consist of
two bands in the regions 18500-18000 cm1
and 21000-20000 cm1, which clearly indicated the octahedral
stereochemistry of the complexes. The band maxima and their assignments are presented in Table 7. In the
present work the ligand field parameters were calculated by the methods given by Reedijk et al./60/for the
ligand field spectra of octahedral Coz/
complexes. The energy of V corresponds to 10 Dq for weak field and
the value of Dq is obtained from it. With these assignments, the calculated ligand field parameters B and Dq
have also been calculated and given in Table 7. The existence of distortion from a regular octahedral
structure was revealed by appreciable intensity enhancement in all the Coz+
complexes studied. Apart from
this, no differences in the spectra of regular and pseudo octahedral complexes of Coz+
were observed.
The absorption spectra of the Ni2/
complexes studied displayed bands (Table 8) in 11000-8200 cm"1
(vl),
17500-15400 cm"1
(v2) and 27500-24500 cml
(v3) suggested the octahedral stereochemistry of these
complexes/61,62/. The calculated 10 Dq values are also included in Table 8. In the corresponding [NiC16]2,
[NiBr6]2
or [Ni(NCS)6]2, the 10 Dq values are of the order of 7200, 7000 and 9700 cm1
respectively.
Comparing these values with our results, we can say that there is a weakening effect of axial ligand strength
in the complexes. This weakening effect of the axial ligands is expected because the equatorial ligands exert
a strong steric hinderance preventing axial ligands from approaching the central metal as closely as would be
required for optimum covalent bonding/63/.
Thermogravimetric studies
The thermogravimetric results of cobalt(II) complexes of FFAAPTS (L1) are presented in Table 9. The
thermogravimetric data indicated that the complexes were stable up to 85C and non-hygroscopic in nature.
At temperature range of 80-125C, one coordinated water molecule is lost, after which decomposition and
deligation processes started. Finally, at ~600C, Co304 was obtained as final residue. The thermal
decomposition may be represented by the following equations:
[Co(L1)(H20)CI2] 85-125 c > [Co(Id)Cl2] 2-28 c

Biological properties
A number of workers /27,31,64-67/ were interested in investigating the biological and medicinal
properties of transition metal complexes of thiosemicarbazones. Thomas and Parmeswaran /31/ studied the
antitumour activities of Mn2/, Co/, Ni2/
and Cu2/
chelates of anthracene-9-carboxaldehyde
thiosemicarbazone. Murthy and Dharmaraja /64/ reported the cytotoxic activity of phenylglyoxal
bis(thiosemicarbazone) against Ehrlich ascites carcinona cells. These compounds were also screened for
antimicrobial activity on B.subtilis and E.coli. They inhibited the bacterial owth considerably. In the
present studies, the antibacterial activities of the cobalt(II) complexes and standard drugs (ampicillin and
teracycline) were screened by agar-cup method in DMF solvent at a concentration of 50 Ig/ml; the results
were checked against gram positive bacteria B.subtilis and S.aureus and gram negative bacteria E.coli and
S.typhi (Table 10). The diameters of zone of inhibition (in mm) of the standard drug ampicillin against gram
positive bacteria B.subtilis and S.aureus and gram negative bacteria E.coli and S.typhi were found to be 24,
22, 17 and 16 respectively, while tetracycline gave 18, 17, 21 and 22 respectively. Under identical conditions,
Table 10 shows that all the cobalt(II)-thiosemicarbazone complexes have moderate antibacterial activities
against these bacteria. Both thiosemicarbazones and their cobalt(II) complexes were screened for their
antifungal activities against two fungi (A.niger and C.albicans). The results (Table-10) showed that almost all
complexes showed nearly the same extent of activity, but they are less active compared to salicylic acid. It is
interesting to note that due to presence of fttran ring and comparatively faster diffusion of FFAAPTS
complexes showed increased antifungal activity than that of 4'-NO2BAAPTS complexes. These compounds
were found to be efficient antifungal agents.

CONCLUSION
The type of complexes isolated during the present study demonstrate that interactions of CO2+
and Ni2/
salts with thiosemicarbazones lead to complexes with 1"1 and 1:2 stoichiometries. Co(II) complexes of both
the thiosemicarbazones showed moderate antibacterial activities against E.coli and S.typhi. The compounds
have antifungal activity against A.niger and C.albicans. FFAAPTS complexes showed increased antifungal
activity than that of 4'-NO2BAAPTS complexes. The overall experimental evidence shows that these metal
ions display a coordination number six and presumably have a distorted octahedral environment around the
metal ion as shown in Figures 1 and 2.
