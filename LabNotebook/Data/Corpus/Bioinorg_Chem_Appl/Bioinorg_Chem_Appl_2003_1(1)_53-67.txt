ABSTRACT
A brief overview of the use of gold compounds in medicine, namely in the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis is presented, including that of the orally-administered triethylphosphinegold(I)
tetraacetylatedthioglucose species, auranofin. A summary of an evaluation for anti-arthritic activity of novel
phosphinegold(I) thiolate analogues containing biologically active thiols is given. This shows that
compounds with greater efficacy and reduced toxic side-effects, at least in the in vivo model studied, can be
developed. More recent investigations on this class of compound have focussed on their putative anti-tumour
activity. Significant cytotoxicity and apparent cellular specificity have been discovered for certain
phosphinegold(I) thiolates carrying water-solubilising groups. All indications are there that the continued
exploration of the medicinal properties of phosphinegold(I) thiolates offers very real opportunities in
metallotherapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
The use of metal compounds in medicine is now well established. This is no better evidenced than by the
appearance of comprehensive reviews of the subject, e.g./1, 2/. Thus, metal compounds containing bismuth,
gold, and platinum are well known as therapeutic agents against peptic ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis and
various forms of cancer, respectively. While this list is by no means exhaustive, it is also important to realise
that many metal compounds containing different elements are undergoing preliminary and clinical trials,
suggesting that new metal-based drugs are imminent. Further, metal compounds find wide use as imaging
53
I'olume I. No. 1. 2003 Phosphinegold(1)Thiolates-Pharmacological Use and Potential
agents/1, 2/. Amongst the oldest metals used in medicine, for real or putative treatments, is gold and this
element forms the focus ofthe present review.
The mystique associated with the noblest of all elements, gold, has ensured it has played a role in
medicine for thousands of years. Indeed, gold has been recorded as being used to treat a variety of ailments
by Chinese and Arabic physicians since 2500 BC. In more modern times, a scientific basis for employing
gold compounds was established by Robert Koch as it was his work that established the bacteriostatic
properties of gold cyanide preparations; for a fascinating account of the historical development of gold in
medicine, the reader is referred to ref. /3/. Since then, gold compounds have demonstrated the ability to
ameliorate the symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis e.g./4, 5/; see below. Given the widespread use
of metal-based drugs, it is perhaps not surprising that gold compounds have been investigated for other
medicinal applications. Arguably, most attention in this regard has been devoted to discovery of anti-tumour
activity of both gold(I) and gold(III) compounds e.g./6/. Over and above this, gold compounds have been
investigated for the treatment of parasitic diseases such as malaria e.g./7/and Chagas disease e.g./8/. A
number of gold compounds have exhibited some anti-HIV activity e.g./9/and older work has suggested that
some gold compounds used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis may be utilised in the treatment of
bronchial asthma e.g./10/. Given the use and .potential use of gold compounds in medicine, it is perhaps
surprising that the mechanism(s) of action of gold drugs is not very well understood and is, in fact, subject to
contention. A recent review covers many aspects of the biochemistry of gold and its compounds, and is
highly recommended reading/11/. Despite this lack of understanding of the precise mechanism of action of
gold drugs, it is the known anti-arthritic activity and putative anti-tumour activity that motivates our studies
in this area and forms the emphasis ofthis review.
Our research in this field was initiated by the desire to develop new phosphinegold(I) thiolates that could
supplant the currently used gold-based anti-arthritic agents. Based on encouraging early results, in particular
the relatively high mammalian tolerance of our compounds, and prompted by commercial advice, the focus
of our research turned to the examination of the anti-tumour potential of the newly synthesised compounds.
In this review, a brief summary of the attempted development of new anti-arthritic agents will be presented
that is followed by a summary ofour research into the anti-tumour activity ofphosphinegold(I) thiolates.
PHOSPHINEGOLD(1) THIOLATES AS ANTI-ARTHRITIC AGENTS
Chrysotherapy is the term given to describe the use of gold compounds in medicine. Therefore, this term
refers to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis as, to date, gold compounds are not used in any other
therapeutic applications. There are a relatively large number of gold compounds used in this context and they
can be conveniently divided into two classes, reflecting their mode of administration. The first therapeutic
gold drugs were the polymeric gold thiolates. Chemical structures for these are shown in Fig. 1. The
compounds are water-soluble, being charged as in sanocrysin (1, aurothiosulphate), allocrysin (2,
aurothiopropanol sulphonate), and arguably the most widely-used gold drug, myocrisin (4, aurothiomalate) or
by carrying water-solubilising functionality as in solganol (3, aurothioglucose), so that their mode of
54

administration is normally via injection, usually on a weekly basis. A more recent addition to chrysotherapy
is the decidedly more lipophilic compound, auranofin (5, (1-thio-[3-D-glucopyranose-2,3,4,6-tetraacetato-S)-
(triethylphosphine)gold(I)), as shown in Fig. 2, which is an example of a phosphinegold(1) thiolate. Owing to
its lipophilic nature, auranofin is administered orally on a daily basis. In common with other forms of
metallotherapy, the administration of gold drugs inevitably results in a number of deleterious side-effects
such as nausea, dermatitis, nephritis, etc. Further, not all patients respond to chrysotherapy. With the above in
mind, there is a definite need for more effective gold compounds for the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis and
compounds with reduced toxic side-effects. Our contributions in this area were motivated by exploiting the
relatively little knowledge that was known ofthe mechanism ofaction ofgold drugs.

It has been established that gold drugs are in fact pro-drugs, as the original gold compounds are rapidly
metabolised in vivo in order to generate the pharmacologically active species/11/. For example, auranofin (5)
is known to react with the ubiquitous blood protein, albumin, at the cysteine-34 site, with displacement of the
55
l"ohmle 1. No. 1, 2003 Phosphine_old(l)Thiolates-Pharmacological Use and Potemial
tetraacetylatedthioglucose moiety by the protein. Subsequent reaction of the gold compound with other thiols
such as albumin or glutathione results in liberation of triethylphosphine, which is rapidly oxidised to its oxide
with concomitant reduction of the disulphide link in albumin. It is this way, it is clear that the gold
compounds serve as a carrier to deliver gold so as to form a gold/protein complex. Given this information, it
seemed obvious to couple biologically active thiols, i.e. thiols with known anti-arthritic profiles, with
phosphinegold(I) entities so that upon administration, both the "gold" and liberated thiol could provide
therapeutic advantage. With this in mind, thiols such as 6-mercaptopurine (6a) and 6-thioguanine (6b),
molecules with known anti-arthritic activity /12/, were complexed to phosphinegold(1) to form species
represented as e.g. 7; see Fig. 3 for chemical structures. Given that the protocols associated with anti-arthritic
screening are not widely known, it is appropriate that a brief outline be presented here.

In vivo screening for anti-arthritic activity was conducted in an animal model developed specifically for
this purpose /13, 14/. The dark Agouti rat model is a gold-sensitive rat strain that most closely matches
human response to gold drugs. Typically, rats have arthritic symptoms induced by the application of
arthritogenic Freund's adjuvant into the tail-base. A sub-set of these animals has concomitant administration
of the trial gold compound. Differences in physical appearance are then assessed so to as to determine
potency and toxicity ofthe gold compounds.
An example of a biological trial is shown in Fig. 4 which shows the lower parts of three dark Agouti rats.
Here, the animal on the left is the control, having neither induced arthritis nor administration of gold
compound. The animal on the right has had arthritis induced as can be readily judged by paw and tail
swelling. The animal in the middle has had arthritis induced by Freund's adjuvant arthritis and at the same
time has been administered with a gold compound so that reduced paw and tail swelling is evident. The
determination ofthe efficacy and toxicity is based on qualitative assessments.

Potency is scored on a rating of '+' to '4+'. A score of 3+. corresponded to treatments that had completely
suppressed polyarthritis on day 18. The highest rating of 4+ equated to the situation where no arthritis had
developed by day 28. Toxicity is rated from '-' to '2+', with the latter value being regarded as unacceptable.
Toxicity was judged by considering weight loss, diarrhoea and albuminuria in both treated and untreated
animals. Table summarises potency and toxicity ratings for a series of phosphinegold(I) mercaptopurinates
(Fig. 3), for related thiolates (see Fig. 5 for structures ofthiols), and for the gold drugs aurothiomalate (4) and
auranofin ()/15, 16/.
From the data presented in Table a number of conclusions can be made. First and foremost, several of
the compounds exhibit anti-arthritic potency to a far greater extent than auranofin (;), recalling that ratings of
4+ correspond to no signs of the disease at day 28, after which animal ethics regulations dictated that the
animal must be sacrificed. Further, many of the compounds had toxicity ratings significantly lower than that
for 5. Comparing the new results with those obtained for aurothiomalate, for which toxicity is not as great as
for 5, many ofthe compounds listed had higher potency ratings.
It was mentioned above that 6-mercaptopurine (6a) and 6-thioguanine (6b) have exhibited anti-arthritic
activity in their own right. So it is pertinent to recognise that complexation to phosphinegold(I) resulted in
more potent compounds thereby demonstrating the importance of gold for therapeutic applications. The most
active compounds were indeed those containing the deprotonated forms of 6a and 6b. Other derivatives

screened for anti-arthritic activity: (11) alkyl (aryl) xanthate and (12) phosphinothioformamideo
Of all the compounds screened, the most potent and least toxic was Et3PAu(6-MP), having potency and
toxicity ratings of 4+ and -, respectively. This compound has the same phosphine ligand as found in
auranofin, i.e. triethylphosphine. However, no definitive structure/activity relationship may be established as
for other series of compounds, different phosphine ligands were incorporated in the most active compounds.
These observations suggest that it is a subtle combination of both thiolate and phosphine ligands that gives
rise to the more active compounds. As an example of this point, a series triorganophosphinegold(I) xanthates
(see Fig. 6 for the structure of the xanthate anion), i.e. R3PAu(S2COMe), were evaluated/16/. For the R Ph
and Cy compounds, the potency was rated as + and 3+, respectively. By contrast, the R Et compound was
lethal.
From the above discussion and data presented in Table 1, it is clear that some of the compounds possess
potency and toxicity profiles that, at a minimum, rival those exhibited by the commercially available drugs.
A particularly exciting feature of the above studies was the observation that relatively high doses of 'gold'
could be tolerated by the dark Agouti rats, i.e. up to 10 mg/kg every two days for up to 9 doses suggesting a
high-level of tolerance. Further studies in putative biological activity have focussed on anti-tumour activity
for essentially the same reasons as given for the study of these compounds in the first place. Thus, not only
do the thiols mercaptopurine (6a) and 6-thioguanine (6b) exhibit immunosuppressant activity, they display
antineoplastic activity /12/ and so it was thought worthwhile to investigate the cytotoxicity/anti-tumour
activity ofphosphinegold(I) thiolates.
CYTOTOXICITY AND ANTI-TUMOUR ACTIVITY OF PHOSPHINEGOLD(1) THIOLATES
There are in fact several good reasons for exploring the anti-tumour potential of phosphinegold(l)
thiolates. One obvious reason is as given above, i.e. that the complexation ofbiologically active thiols to gold
will alter the metabolic pathways of the thiols and/or provide a slow-release mechanism ofthe thiol, either of
which might lead to different profiles of anti-tumour activity. Thus, one might regard the gold as a 'platform'
or carrier for the effective delivery of a thiol for therapeutic effect. Another justification for investigating
59
l,"ohtme I. No. 1, 2003 Phosphinegold(l)Thiolates-Pharmacological Use and Potential
gold compounds in this context is found from the medical literature. Long-term studies established a possible
connection between chrysotherapy and anti-tumour activity. In this way, evidence was presented that
suggested that patients undergoing chrysotherapy were less likely to suffer from cancer disease/18/. This
finding inevitably led to the investigation of anti-tumour activity of gold compounds used in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis. Of these, auranofin (5) proved to be the most interesting and was subjected to further
evaluation.
Auranofin (5) was proven to possess significant in vitro activity/19-21/and this was translated into
animal models but only for P388 leukaemia inoculated in mice/22, 23/. Not surprisingly, many auranofin
derivatives were subsequently investigated for cytotoxicity and anti-tumour activity/24/. This early work
unveiled a number of interesting conclusions that still direct on-going studies in this field. Arguably, the key
result of this study was the establishment of the following principle: compounds that were active in vitro
were not necessarily active in vivo but compounds that were not active in vitro were unlikely to be active in
vivo. Hence, at least for the gold compounds investigated, a protocol was established that allowed the rapid
and economical screening of gold compounds for anti-tumour potential. In terms of a possible
structure/activity relationship, several clues were uncovered/24/.
It was shown that phosphinegold(1) thiolates were more active than gold thiolates, indicating the
importance of the phosphine ligand for activity. In the same way, phosphinegold(1) thiolates had more
promising cytotoxicity profiles than their chloride analogues, showing that, potentially, the thiolate ligand
also plays a role in cytotoxicity/anti-tumour activity/24/. In summary, and important in the context of the
present overview, this study indicated the potential of phosphinegold(I) thiolates as anti-tumour agents.
Despite this, the immediate focus of subsequent studies was upon the bis-chelated, tetrahedrally coordinated
gold(I) compound, [Au(dppe)2]+
(13, dppe is bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane, see Fig. 7 for chemical
structure), an often observed rearrangement product from precursors such as XAu(t-dppe)AuX, and
analogues, as these showed promising activity e.g./25/. Clinical trials for [Au(dppe)2]+
were precluded owing
to acute toxicity in organs such as the heart, liver and lungs /26/. Nevertheless, studies continue with
analogues of [Au(dppe)2]+, with the purpose of targeting mitochondrial DNA/27/. Biological evaluation of
phosphinegold(I) thiolate species continues owing to the promising activity exhibited by the
phosphinegold(I) thiolates as reported above.

Besides the aforementioned studies, the first work published describing investigations of the potential
anti-tumour activity of phosphinegold(1) thiolates was published in the early 1990's /28-30/. The
triphenylphosphinegold(I) compound of the anion derived from thiotheophylline (14, 8-mercapto-l,3-
dimethyl-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione; see Fig. 8) has demonstrated potency against L1210 leukaemia,
B16F10 melanoma, and in Friend leukaemia cells in culture, and shows greater activity than the
uncomplexed ligand/28/, again demonstrating the importance of gold for efficacy. A possible indication to
the mode of action of phosphinegold(1) thiolates was indicated by the observation that the compound was
readily incorporated into the cytoplasm and in the nuclear fraction so as to induce single-stranded breaks in
DNA/29, 30/. Our work in this field has been motivated by the detection of eytotoxicity/anti-tumour activity
ofphosphinegold(I) thiolates, described above. A particular focus has been to couple biologically-active thiols
with phosphinegold(I) entities in the hope that upon administration of the 'pro-drug', both the
phosphinegold(I) entity and thiol wouldprovide therapeutic benefit.

The first cytotoxicity screens in this aspect of our study/31, 32/were conducted on compounds related to
those described above for the anti-arthritic assays. Selected data are collated in Table 2; see Figs 3 and 5 for
chemical structures. From this data, it is evident that the presence ofthe phosphinegold(I) entity enhances the
overall cytotoxicity of the thionucleobases studied, some of which display activity against leukaemia/12/. In
the case of the triphenylphosphinegold(I) species, the importance of having thiolate present is also apparent
as triphenylphosphinegold(I) chloride is less eytotoxic, at least in the cell lines examined. All of the
phosphinegold(I) compounds listed have cytotoxicities greater than the standard compound, cisplatin, in a
range of cancer cell lines: mouse leukaemia, human squamous cell carcinoma and human ovarian carcinoma.
This high-level of cytotoxicity is particularly noticeable against the cisplatin-resistant mouse leukaemia cell
line. These results were ofsufficient interest to warrant further investigation.
In vivo studies conducted on a cisplatin-sensitive PC6 plasmacytoma inoculated in mice revealed that
cisplatin cured all mice. By contrast, the 6-MPH (at 50 mg/kg) and Ph3PAuCI (at 25 mg/kg) compounds did
not reduce the size of the tumour. More effective was Ph3PAu(6-MP) (at 25 mg/kg) which led to a 60%
reduction in tumour size/32/. The cytotoxicity profiles of four compounds were also evaluated against the
National Cancer Institute's (U.S.A.) panel of 60 cell lines/33/. Thus, an order of cytotoxicity was established
for the R3PAu(6-MP) series such that R Cy > Ph > Et. The other compound examined was EtaPAu(6-TG)
and amongst all four compounds, Cy3PAu(6-MP) was the most cytotoxic. Finally, sub-panel selectivity

against the leukaemia cell lines was found for both Cy3PAu(6-MP) and Et3PAu(6-TG)/33/. Further studies
have focussed upon increasing the aqueous solubility of the phosphinegold(l) thiolates. A difficulty that was
identified for the aforementioned 6-MP and 6-TG compounds was their insolubility in aqueous medium/34/.
Hence, compounds with water-solubilising functionality have been developed and these, too, have been
shown to exhibit exciting cytotoxicity profiles.
Subsequent work involved a panel of seven human cell lines as indicated in Tables 3 and 4/35-37/. In
Table 3, results are listed for Ph3PAu(6-MP), to allow for reference to previous work, two new compounds,
i.e. R3PAu(SC(=O)Ph) for R Ph and Cy, and a series of established cytotoxic agents, namely cisplatin,
doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, etoposide and taxol/35/; structures for the non-metal containing
compounds are shown in Fig. 9. The gold compounds display moderate to high toxicity, especially compared
to cisplatin. While there is an obvious attraction to develop compounds with greater cytotoxicity profiles than
cisplatin, it is also imperative that the compounds are more active than the established 'organic' drugs.
Against this criterion, the investigated phosphinegold(1) thiolates were not particularly promising. Another
key objective of drug design is to generate compounds with specificity in activity, i.e. compounds that target
specific cell lines. The above aims have been realised, at least based on in vitro studies, for the next series of
compounds to be discussed.

Fig. 9: Chemical structures of ,15;) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), (16) taxol (TAX), (17) doxorubicin (DOX), (18)
methotrexate (MTX), and (19) etoposide (ETO).
The cytotoxicity data for a series of isomeric triorganophosphinegold(I) n-mercaptobenzoates, R3PAu(n-
SC6H4-COzH), are summarised in Table 4; cytotoxicity data for taxol are given in Table 3 for comparative
purposes. From these data it is evident that while many of the gold compounds exhibited moderate to high
64
Efi,ard R. 7 "lTekink Bioinorganic Chemistty andApplications
levels of cytotoxicity, it was the 2-mercaptobenzoate series that proved to have the most interesting profiles.
Pacticularly interesting was the suggestion that there might be some selectivity in the cytotoxic profile of the
2-mercaptobenzoates against the H226 (non-small cell lung cancer) and A498 (renal cancer) cancer cell lines.
The Et3PAu(2-SC6H4CO2H) compound was the most active of the gold compounds trialled and the order of
cytotoxicity for R3PAu(2-SC6H4CO2H) was R Et > Cy > Ph. Particularly noteworthy was that in the case of
H226 cell line, Et3PAu(2-SC6H4CO2H) was more active than all of the established anti-tumour agents
examined /36/. Having established these compounds possess cytotoxic activity, the challenge now is to
conduct in vivo studies and these are underway at the time ofwriting.
CONCLUSIONS
The use of the phosphinegold(l) thiolate, auranofin (5), in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis indicates
that this class of compound has potential for furtlaer development in medicinal chemistry. This is further
borne out by the anti-tumour activity exhibited by 5. Subsequent research, described above, has demonstrated
that it is indeed possible to discover new anti-arthritic compounds with greater potency and reduced toxic
side-effects, as judged by in vivo screening. Exciting developments also await discovery in the anti-tumour
activity of phosphinegold(1) thiolates as cytotoxicity screening suggests that certain derivatives have very
high potency and, perhaps even more importantly, there are indications of cancer cell specificity. Clearly,
these preliminary results indicate the need for in vivo studies to confirm anti-tumour activity and acceptable
toxicity profiles. Such developments as described above provide ample justification for further research
activity in the field ofmetal-based drugs, in particular the investigation ofgold compounds.
