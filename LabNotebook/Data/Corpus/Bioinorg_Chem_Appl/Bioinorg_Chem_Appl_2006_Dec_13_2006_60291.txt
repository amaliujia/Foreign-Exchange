INTRODUCTION
The perturbation of the I−I bond when diiodine binds to
heterocycles such as thioamides or selonoamides results to novel
complexes containing iodine [–].
Various types of such complexes have been obtained thus far,
including charge transfer (ct) complexes with the so-called
“spoke” or “extended spoke” structures (DS · I2 or DS · I2 · I2) (D is the ligand donor) [], the “T-shape” structures, iodine(I)
coordinated to two thioamides to form “iodonium salts”
([DS−I−DS]+ · (I3)−) [], oxidation products of formulae (DS−I)+ [], dications of formulae ([DS−SD]2+(In−)2),
[] and monocations of formulae ([DS−SDH]+(I3)−) [] (DS or D=S, a thioamide ligand donor).

The interest in studying I2 interaction with
thioamides and selenoamides arises from their application in both
biological chemistry and material sciences. Thus,
thioamides, like 6-n-propyl-thiouracil (PTU),
N-methyl-imidazoline-2-thione (methimazole, MMI),
3-methyl-2-thioxo-4-imidazoline-1-carboxylate (carbimazole)
(CBZ), are known antithyroid drugs [] against
hyperthyroidism, while thiazolidine-2-thione (TZD) and
1,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)-benzimidazoline-2-thione (BHBZIM)
were also used as such, in the past. Hyperthyroidism (Grave's
disease) is characterized by the overproduction of T4 and T3 hormones. The way that the above and other similar thioamides
interact with I2 is of great importance, in an attempt to approximate the elucidation of their mechanism of action, since
I2 is involved in the synthesis of both T4 and T3 hormones [–];

iodine chemistry is recently proving to be of considerable
interest because of the discovery of low-temperature, semi- and
superconducting polyiodides, which quickly led to the deliberate
doping of conjugated polymers with elemental iodine []. The ability of iodine to catenate leads to the formation of
polyiodides of various structures [] reviewed recently by Boyle et al, Deplano et al, and Svensson et al [–].
The structural variety of polyiodides ranges from the simple
I−3 through the linear I2−4, the V-shaped I−5, three-pronged structures of I−7, I−9, I2−10, and I2−12, the Z-shaped I−7, I2−8, the branched I2−16, and the
S-shaped and linear I4−16 species to infinite chains []. The size and shape of the polyiodide ions have been found to depend in an unpredictable way on the size and shape of the counter ion.



In this paper, we review the results of our work on the iodine
interaction with thioamides. Complexes of the so-called “spoke”
and “extended spoke” structures, D · I2 and D · I2 · I2, respectively, (D is the ligand donor) (ii) iodonium salts of {[D2−I]+[In]−}
(n = 3, 7) and {[D2−I]+[FeCl4]−}
formulae and (iii) disulfides of the categories (a)
[D−D] and (b) {[D−DH]+[I3]−} produced by oxidation action of I2, have been isolated and characterized. A compound of formula {[D2−I]+[I3]−[D · I2]} containing both types of complexes (i) and (ii) was also isolated.

In addition the results on interaction between
diiodine with selenium analogs of the antithyroid drug
6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) of formulae RSeU have also been
included. Complexes of formulae [(RSeU)I2] with “spoke” structures have been isolated. These complexes are stable in nonpolar solvents, but they decompose in polar solvents,
producing diselenide compounds or undertaking deselenation. All
these results are well correlated with the mechanism of action of
antithyroid drugs. Finally, we review here our work on the
diiodine interaction with the amides (LO) (L = organic
framework), 2-hydroxy-pyridine and 2-hydroxy-pyrimidine. Complexes
of formulae {(LO)3[(LO)]+ · I−3}, {(LO)6 · [(LO)2]2+ · ((1/2)I−) · ((3/2)I−7) · (I2)}, as well as
{[LOH]+Cl−I2} have been isolated and characterized.

The ligands used in the present study are summarized in
.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthesis of thioamide-diiodine complexes
Charge transfer complexes with “spoke” or “extended spoke” structures
Reactions between diiodine and the thioamides
(1)–(5) () lead to the
formation of charge transfer (ct) complexes with the so-called
“spoke” or “extended spoke” structures (DS · I2 or DS · I2 ⋯ I2) according to the general reaction shown in .

Thus, reaction of diiodine with (1), (2), (3), or (4) in a molar ratio 1 : 1
(I2 : L) results to the formation of ct complexes of formulae [(BZT)I2] (17) [], [(PTU)I2] (18) [],
[(CBZT)I2] (19) [], and [(NMBZT)I2] (20) [] with spoke
structures (). Reactions of diiodine with
(1) or (5) in 2 : 1 (I2 : L) molar
ratio form ct complexes of extended spoke structures with formulae
[(BZT)I2I2] (21) [] and
[(BZIM)I2I2H2O] (22) [] ().

 summarizes bond distances and angles of
importance of our ct complexes with spoke and extended spoke
structures.

The I−I bond distances are varying from
2.79 Å, in case of complexes with weak I−S
interaction, to 3.08 Å, as a result of a strong
I−S interaction. The corresponding I−I bond
is subsequently elongated with respect to the corresponding
distance in free I−I in the solid state [] 
(2.717 Å at 110 K []). Bigoli et al [] has classified iodine adducts of sulfur donors into three classes,
depending on I−I bond order (n), calculated from
Pauling's equation d(I−I) = d0 − 0.85 · log(n)   [where d is I−I interatomic distance of the adduct, d0 is the I−I bond distance of gas phase I2 (2.67 Å), and n is the I−I bond order]
[]. When n ≥  0.6 and d(I−I) &lt; 2.85 Å, the adduct is type A, and when  n ≤ 0.4 and d(I−I) &gt; 3.01 Å, it is type C. Compounds with intermediate values were classified as type B. Thus, compounds (18) and (20)
are classified into A type, compounds (19), (21), and (22) into B type, whereas
compound (17) is C type.

 correlates d(I−I) versus
d(I−S). A linear correlation is observed with
the exception of complex (17). This behavior has been
already explained [].

The S−I−I group has a linear structure with an
angle of almost 180°. The N−C−S−I torsion angle is also found almost equal to 180° indicating an almost coplanar
arrangement of the I2 towards &gt; C=S bond except the case of [(PTU)I2] complex, where it is found to be −95.93°. In fact, [(PTU)I2] complex is the first ct complex with perpendicular arrangement of I2 towards &gt; C=S characterized by X-ray crystallography [].

An extended intermolecular 1D network through hydrogen bonding
interaction is also formed in complex [(BZT)I2]
(17) with N ⋯ I = 3.597(18) Å
().

Iodonium salt complexes
Reaction between diiodine and thioamides such as TZD (6)
or BZIM (5) leads to the formation of iodonium salt complexes of 
[{(TZD)2I+}·I−3 · 2I2] (23) () and
{[(BZIM)2I+]I−3}{[(BZIM)I2]} (24)
() formulae according to the reaction in
.

The two I−S bond distances are 2.654(6) Å in
(23) and in case of (24) they are 2.597(4) Å and 2.702(4) Å, respectively.
The I−I bond distances in I−3 counter anions are found to be equal (I−I = 2.9195(14) Å) in case of (23). In case of (24) two types of I−3 counter anions are observed, one is symmetric with I(1)−I(2) = 2.9300(12) Å while the other is not since it participates
in hydrogen bonding (I(1A)−I(2A)= 2.880(6) Å
and I(1A)−I(3A) = 3.058(5) Å, resp) and better
described as I−, interacting with 
I2(I ⋯ I2) []. The two hydrogen bonding interactions are taking place between the I+ and the hydrogen atoms of the amide nitrogen atoms 
(H[N] ⋯ I = 2.9336(6) Å) in case of (23)
() and I(11) ⋯ H−N(11)″ of 3.20 Å in case of (24) (). Ab initio quantum mechanical methods and density functional theory (DFT)
techniques applied on the iodonium part of (24) suggested
that the conformations obtained in the crystalline state result
from an intermolecular electrostatic interaction between the
positively charged iodine and the negatively charged NH (total
group (NH) charges calculated −0.005 e for N(11)″, −0.014 e for N(21)″, −0.004 e for N(13)″,
and −0.012 e for N(23)″) [] ().

When (NMBZT) (4) reacts with diiodine in the presence of
FeCl3 in a molar ratio of 3 : 6 : 1 
(NMBZT : I2 : FeCl3)  , complex {[(NMBZT)2I]+ · [FeCl4]−} (25)
() together with {[(NMBZT)2I+]}·[I7]− were formed []. The I−S bond distances are I−S = 2.5961(15) Å and
2.6596(14) Å, respectively, with an almost linear
S−I+−S arrangement
(S−I−S = 177.77(5)°)


Monocationic and neutral disulfides
The reaction of 2-mercaptopyridine (PYSH) (7) with
diiodine in a molar ratio of 1 : 2 led to the oxidation and
dimerization of the ligand and produced {(PYS−PYSH)+ · I−3} (26)
(). The structure of the compound consists of
two residues; one cationic (PYS−PYSH)+, containing the S−S bond linking the two
2-mercapto-pyridine molecules one of which is protonated, and one
I−3 counter anion. In the crystal lattice there are four symmetry-independent cation-anion pairs. There are only a few crystal structures reported in the literature containing open
chain stable cations of DS-SD dimers, such as the monocationic:
{[(C4H6N2S−SN2C4H5)2]2+ · (I−3) · (I−5)} []. The two
I−I bond distances of the I−3 in the four components of complex (26) are 2.887(4) Å
and 2.944(3) Å in component a, 2.874(4) Å
and 2.957(3) Å in b, 2.968(3) Å and
2.862(3) Å in c, and 2.855(4) Å and
2.927(3) Å in d, respectively, indicating a
slight asymmetry of I3− in this complex (covalent
linear asymmetric).

Moreover, when MNA (8), MBA (9), or PMT (10) reacts with diiodine
under the same experimental conditions as in the case of the preparation of complex (7), (see above), neutral disulfides were produced with formulae
[(MNA)2] (27), [(MBA)2] (28), and [(PMT)2] (29) according to the reaction shown in . 
shows the disulfide formed in case of (10) with formula
[(PMT)2] (29).

Complex (24) isolated from the reaction of (5)
and I2 reveals the cocrystallization of both a
“spoke” structure and an iodonium salt structure. This leads to
the conclusion that the equilibrium of  is
established in solution.

It has also been shown that the disproportionation reaction, with
the generation of the ionic compound from thioamide-iodine
complexes, exhibits pressure dependence []. A pressure increase leads to the ionic iodonium salt (iii) from (ii)
(). The favoring of {[(MBZIM)2I]+[I3]−} (24a) formation is also proved by computational studies, based on energetic grounds [].

The conductivity measurements indicate that when diiodine is added
to a solution of BZIM (5) (D=S), initially
both the neutral (I) and the ionic (IIa)
compounds are formed as it is shown in
. Further addition of diiodine
results to the ionic complex (IIa). In the case of NMBZT
() a cocrystallization of both the spoke
and iodonium complexes takes place producing only the iodonium
complex, in excess of I2.

For the mechanism of action of antithyroid drugs the reaction
scheme shown in  is followed.

Our results strongly indicate that the antithyroid drugs PTU
(2) and N-Methyl-2-mercapto-imidazoline (MMI) have a
different way of action. Thus, (2) together with NMBZT
(4) forming weak S−I ct complexes
() may interfere either by inhibiting TPO
activity [] or by inhibiting deiodinase (ID-1) enzyme which is responsible for the formation of T3 from T4 hormone.

MMI, TZD (6), PYSH (7), PMT (10), MNA (8), and MBA (9), on the other hand, that strongly bind to I2 or are oxidized to disulfides
[] most probably interfere in the formation of monoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT) by the tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin Tyr(TG), competing with active iodine.

Synthesis of selenoamide-diiodine complexes
Since thyroid deiodinase contains selenocysteine [], the seleno-analog of PTU (PSeU) is expected to exhibit a higher
antithyroid activity than PTU, because of the easier formation of
Enzyme-Se-Se-PSeU species than Enzyme-Se-S-PTU due to the higher
nucleophilicity of Se. To examine this possibility we have
extended our studies to the interaction of I2 with selenoamides.  shows the ligand used in this work. Ligands (11)–(14) were synthesized according the reactions shown in
.

Reactions of alkyl-selenoamides with diiodine in a 1 : 1 molar
ratio in dichloromethane solutions result in the formation of
[(RSeU)I2] [R = methyl-, ethyl-, n-propyl-, and i-propyl-] ().

[(n-PrSeU)I2] (30) was found to be a charge transfer complex with an Se−I bond. The
I−I interatomic distance of 2.8928(10) Å is
longer than that in either the gas phase (2.677 Å) or
crystalline diiodine (2.717 Å at 110 K) presumably
owing to the Se ⋯ I interaction. It is, however, the
shortest such distance measured for a diiodine-selenoamide
complexes suggesting a minimal perturbation resulting from the
Se ⋯ I contact, which is the longest measured thus
far []. The I−I bond order of 0.547 calculated for [(n-PrSeU)I2] from Pauling's equation d(I−I) = d0 −0.85·log(n) (1)
(where d is I−I interatomic distance of the adduct,
d0 is the I−I bond distance of gas phase
I2 (2.67 Å) and n is the I−I bond order) [] is the highest such bond order for selenoamide-diiodine complexes. All these data are consistent with
a weak Se ⋯ I interaction, the weakest ever found.
According to Bigoli et al classification, complex (30) is
classified in the B type of adduct. It is interesting to
note that the corresponding [(PTU)I2] complex forms a weaker ct complex, with an I−I bond order of 0.65e [] compared to the 0.547e found for
[(n-Pr−SeU)I2] which implies a weaker S ⋯ I interaction. With the same classification the former complex is of A type,
while the latter of B type. Interestingly, there is a
linear correlation between the Se ⋯ I and
I−I distances (see  and
).

The diselenides [N-(6-Et-4-pyrimidone)(6-Et-SeU)2]
(31) and [N-(6-n-Pr-4-pyrimidone)(6-n-Pr−SeU)2] (32) () were produced upon
recrystallization of [(n-PrSeU)I2] (30) and [(n-EtSeU)I2] (33) from acetone, as oxidation products. On the other hand, deselenation with the formation of 6-n-propyl-2-uracil (n-Pr−U) (34) was observed when (30) was recrystallized
from methanol/acetonitrile solutions [].

In conclusion, while 6-alkyl-2-selenouracil compounds (RSeU)
() are stable in various solvents, including
water and other polar or nonpolar solvents, “spoke” ct complexes
of formulae [(RSeU)I2] are formed in dichloromethane solutions, but are unstable in methanol/acetonitrile and/or
acetone solutions (). [(RSeU)I2] is transformed to 6-alkyl-2-uracil in methanolic/acetonitrile
solutions (). Upon recrystallization of the
compound in acetone the diselenides containing also a covalent
C−N bond with an adjacent PTU molecule are formed
possibly through the formation of a substituted selenouracil as
indicated by 1H, 13C NMR spectra, and
ESI-MS spectra. The whole process may be hydrolytic
().

Synthesis of amide-diiodine complexes
The reaction of 2-pyridone (PYOH) (15) with diiodine in a
molar ratio of 2 : 1 and 1 : 2, respectively, resulted to the
formation of {(PYOH)3[(PYOH)]+I−3}
(35) and {(PYOH)6 · [(PYOH)2]2+ · ((1/2)I−) · ((3/2)I−7) · (I2)} (36)
complexes (). The reactions were carried out in dichloromethane solutions.

The reaction of 2-pyrimidone (PMOH+2Cl−)
(15) with diiodine in a molar ratio of 1 : 1 resulted to
the formation of {[LOH]+Cl−I2} (37) complex.

In case of complex (36) the counter anions form a
polyiodine network.  shows the polyiodine
network established by weak halogen-halogen interactions, in the
distance range 3.51 Å–3.58 Å, between
I−7 and I2 ⋯ I− ⋯ I2 ions forming an infinite chain.

In conclusion, structures containing polyiodide anions with
cationic aromatic ligands as counterparts of formulae
{[(L)(HL+)] · (I−n)} are known to be
synthesized by the treatment of the appropriate amide with HI
[–]. In contrast, the complexes with PYOH, in the
present case, were formed by the direct reaction of
2-hydroxypyridine with diiodine in a molar ratio of 2 : 1 and
1 : 2. This is a redox reaction, where 2-hydroxy-pyridine firstly
is oxidized to pyridinone-2 radical cation. In the case of
2-hydroxy-pyridine, however, peroxide structures are not formed
like disulfides in the case of PYSH. Polyiodide anions are
simultaneously produced in this case. This should be a consequence
of redox differences between −SH and OH groups
and may be proven a useful pathway for the synthesis of polyiodide
materials.
