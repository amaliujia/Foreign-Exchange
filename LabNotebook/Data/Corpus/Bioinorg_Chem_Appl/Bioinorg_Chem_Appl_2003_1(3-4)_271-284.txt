ABSTRACT
Acylthiourea ligands, N,N-diphenyI-N'-benzoylthiourea (HL and N,N-diphenyI-N'-(p-nitrobenzoyl)
thiourea (HL ) were prepared in high yields (HL: 90%, HL2: 82%), by converting benzoyl chloride or p-
nitrobenzoyl chloride into the corresponding benzoyl isothiocyanate followed by reacting with
diphenylamine. The cis-[PtL2] complexes have been synthesized by reaction of the ligands HL or HL with
KzPtCI4 in a Pt:HL (1:2) molar ratio, in the presence of sodium acetate. The ligands and their cis-[PtL2]
complexes have been characterized by elemental analysis, IR, FAB(+)-MS,H-NMR,3C-NMR and 95pt-
NMR. The molecular structure of cis-bis(N,N-diphenyI-N'-benzoylthioureato) platinum(II) shows a square-
planar geometry with two deprotonated ligands (L) coordinated to Pt(II) through the oxygen and sulfur
atoms in a cis arrangement. The antitumor activity of the ligands and their cis-[PtL2] complexes was
evaluated on mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3. The ICs0.values of culture growth for ligands HL and
HL were 23.1 and 34.9 tM, respectively, whereas for the cis-[PtL2] complexes they were in the range of
2.6-2.8 laM, which indicates that the platinum(|I) complexes are about 10-fold more cytotoxic than the free
ligands and a participation of nitro group in the complex activity is slightly relevant.

platinum(ll) Complexes
1. INTRODUCTION
The transition metal complexes perform an important role in Medicinal Inorganic Chemistry due to their
pharmacological properties in survival systems. Cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(ll) (cisplatin) is an
antineoplastic agent of clinical use, highly effective in treating testicular and ovarian cancers /1/. The
biological efficiency of cisplatin and its analogues, carboplatin and oxaliplatin/2,3/, as antitumoral drugs is
due to the formation of coordination complexes with nuclear DNA, mainly to form Pt-N7 adducts with two
adjacent guanine bases (G-G) on the same nucleotide strand/4/. These conformational changes within the
DNA double helix originate the inhibition of DNA replication and RNA transcription and produce finally the
cell death/5-8/. Despite its efficacy in various neoplastic diseases, cisplatin has several disadvantages due to
its propensity to tumor resistance and by causing several types of dose-limiting toxicity, such as,
nephrotoxicity, nausea, neurotoxicity and myelosuppression/9,10/. With the possibility of exploring a new
class of anticancer agents, Bierbach et al. have synthesized the coordinative saturated platinum(IV)
complexes [PtC14(NH3)L] and [PtC1.3(NH3)2L] (L-l,l,3,3-tetramethylthiourea) by reacting the precursor
cisplatin with thiourea derivative ligands. These complexes showed high cytotoxicity in vitro at micromolar
concentrations against the L1210 leukemia cell of murine/11,12/. Moreover, platinum(If) complexes of type
[Pt(en)(L)Cl] (en-ethylenediamine, L- acridinylthiourea) as possible intercalating agents of DNA have been
synthesized analogously to cisplatin, by replacing two NH3 groups of cisplatin by one bidentate ligand (en)
and a chloride by one monodentate thiourea derivative ligand (L), which coordinates to platinum through a
sulfur atom. The cytotoxic activity presented by these complexes was reflected by low values of IC50 for HL-
60 leukemia cell and human ovarian 2008 and C13 (resistent to cisplatin) cell lines/13/.
In this context, platinum(II) complexes of the type [Pt(L)CI(DMSO)] (L=acylthiourea ligand, R'-
C(O)NHC(S)NR.; R'=aryl, NR2 =amine; DMSO=dimethylsulfoxide) were prepared by Sacht et al. for their
biological and chemical evaluation/14-16/. The acylthiourea after deprotonation ofthe amide group (NHCO)
can act as a bidentate chelate ligand, coordinating to platinum through the oxygen and sulfur donor atoms.
The facility of affording the replacement of the functional groups R and R" to obtain a wide range of ligands
and platinum(If) complexes with different physical and chemical properties, made the assessment ofthis type
of compounds attractive/17,18/. Cytotoxic studies realized on HeLa cancer cell lines have shown that certain
platinum(ll) complexes with these acyithiourea ligands present cytotoxic behaviour with antiproliferative
effects being dependent on the nature or the type of the substituent at the acylthiourea ligand. Moreover, the
interaction of [Pt(L)CI(DMSO)] complexes with nucleotides, calf thymus (ct), poly [d(A-Y)2] (AT) and poly
[d(G-C)2] (GC) DNAs has been evaluated indicating conformational changes on DNA/19/.
As a part of our continuing efforts for the synthesis and development of new platinum(If) antineoplastic
agents with low toxicity and therapeutic improved action, we have prepared platinum(ll) bis-chelate
complexes, cis-[PtLz], with acylthiourea ligands, R'-C(O)NHC(S)NRz for their cytotoxic evaluation as
possible antitumor agents. In this work, we inform ofthe synthesis and characterization of novel platinum (II)
complexes with the ligands N,N-diphenyl-N'-benzoylthiourea (HL1) and N,N-diphenyl-N'-(p-nitrobenzoyl)
thiourea (HL-) and their in vitro cytotoxic effect on mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3.

The mouse mammary adenocarcinoma TA3 used in this study was obtained from ascites fluid of young
adult male CAF Jax mice, which was cultured at 37 C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)
(Sigma Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS) (Difco, Detroit, MI), 25 mM HEPES,
44 mM sodium bicarbonate, 100 U mL1

streptomycin.
2.5.2. Inhibition ofthe TA 3 cell line growth
For these assays, 1.8 2.2 x 10 5 cells mL
-were seeded in 20 mL of culture medium during 96 h. After
24 h of the seeding, either the ligand HL or HL (20, 40 and 60 laM) or their complexes cis-[PtLz] (1, 5 and
t) laM) in DMSO was added to every culture. Parallel cultures were used as control. Cell numbers were
determined using a Neubauer counting chamber every 24 h. The concentrations of every compound were
plotted with respect to the percentage of cell survival. The IC50 values were obtained by graphical
interpolation at 48 h of time of exposure on each one of the compounds. These values represent the drug
concentration (laM) required to inhibit cell growth by 50%. All assays were performed in triplicate and
repeated three times in independent pattern/24/.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of the ligands and their platinum(ll)
complexes
The ligands N,N-diphenyl-N'-benzoylthiourea (HL) and N,N-diphenyI-N'-(p-nitrobenzoyl) thiourea
(HL2) were prepared according the methods described by Hartmann et al. and Brindley et al., respectively
/20,21/. The synthesis involves the reaction of 4-R-benzoyl chloride with potassium thiocyanate in acetone
followed by reacting 4-R-benzoyi isothiocyanate with diphenylamine (Scheme 1). The ligands HL and HL
were obtained in satisfactory yields (82-90 %) and characterized by elemental analysis and IR, H-NMR and
3C-NMR spectroscopy. The molecular structure of HL has been determined by X-ray diffraction.
The complexes cis-[Pt(L)21 and cis-[Pt(L2)2] were prepared by reacting K2PtCI4 with HL or HL (Pt:HL
1:2) in dioxane/water solution at 60 C. The complex cis-[Pt(L)2] was recrystallized from dichloromethane
to yield suitable single crystals and its structure has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction. The complexes cis-
[PtL2] were characterized by elemental analysis and IR, FAB(+)-mass, H-NMR and 95pt-NMR
spectroscopy.
In the IR spectra, the N-H stretching vibrations assigned at 3150-3220 cm for ligands HL and HL
disappeared upon complexation due to the deprotonation of (NHCO) amide group in the ligands. The strong
absorption bands 1692-1696 cm
-and 1231-1247 cm corresponding to the vibrations v(C=O and v(C=S),
respectively, are shifted to lower frequencies 1640-1650 cm and 1218-1220 cn respectively, upon
coordination, which proves that the deprotonated ligands are coordinated to platinum(ll) ion through oxygen
and sulfur donor atoms/25-27/.
In the H-NMR spectra, the deprotonation of the ligands in the complexes is confirmed by the
276
Wilfredo Hernandez et al. Bioinorganic ChemistIy andApplications
disappearance of the N-H signal present in the ligands HL and HL in the range of 8.67- 8.69 ppm. For the
ligand HL2, the aromatic protons signals were affected by the presence of nitro substituent group in the para
position ofbenzoyl moiety. These signals are shifted to downfield for the protons in the meta ( 0.72 ppm) and
ortho (0.17 ppm) positions relative to unsubstituted benzoyl moiety of ligand HLJ.
The 195pt-NMR spectra of the complexes cis-[Pt(L)2] and cis-[Pt(L2)2] showed a single 195pt resonance
at -2583.6 and -2426.0 ppm, respectively. These results confirm the presence of only one isomer which exists
in CDCi3 solution for both complexes, and is in agreement with the 95pt chemical shift range found for other
c/s-[PtL2] square planar platinum(ll) complexes with ligands N,N-dialkyl-N'-acylthiourea described in the
literature/26, 28/. The nitro group effect in the complex c/s-[Pt(L2)2[ is observed for the 95pt chemical shift
of about 158 ppm to downfield relative to complex c/s-[Pt(L)2], and this evidence demonstrates the
sensitivity of the 95pt nucleus to electronic changes on the benzoyl moiety which originate a decrease of the
electron density at the platinum centre/26, 29/.
To confirm the proposed structures of the ligands and their platinum(ll) complexes, structural
determinations of single crystal were carried out for the ligand HL and complex c/s-[Pt(L1)2].
3.2. Structural data
The molecular structures of HL and cis-[Pt(L)2] are shown in Figures and 2, respectively, whereas
their selected bond lentghs and bond angles are presented in Table 2. The crystal structure of the ligand N,N-
diphenyI-N'-(p-nitrobenzoyl)thiourea HL (Fig. 1) shows a twisted conformation with respect to the carbonyl
and thiocarbonyl moieties where the O(1) and S(I) atoms are pointing in opposite directions as reflected by
the torsion angles O(1 )-C(I)-N(1)-C(2) and C(I)-N(I)-C(2)-S(I of 5.74 and 132.58 ,respectively. The
C(I)-O(1) bond (1.209(3) A) is typical for a C=O double bond (1.23 A) while the C(2)-S(1) length (1.664
(2) A) suggests a bond order between a single and double bond in the (C-S) thiocarbonyl moiety. The angle
formed by the phenyl rings bounded to N(2) is 115.4(4) (almost perpendicular) due to the steric interaction
between their aromatic protons. The molecules of HL pack in stacks of alternating orientation and adjacent
molecules are bonded by intermolecular hydrogen bond between the N-H amide and thiocarbonyl moiety
N(I)-H S(I) (N(I) S(I) 3.406 A, H(I) S(I) 2.612 A, N(I)-H(I)... S(I) 154.03 ).

Fig. 2: Molecular structure of cis-[Pt(L1)2] (50 % thermal ellipsoids).
The molecular structure of complex cis-lPt(L)2] (Fig. 2) shows a nearly square-planar geometry (torsion
angles Pt-O(I)-C(1)-N(I) 4 , Pt-S(I)-C(2)-N(I) -6.6 ) with two deprotoned ligands L coordinated to
platinum(II) ion through the oxygen and sulfur donor atoms in a cis arrangement, similar to the cis-[PtL2]
complexes with ligands N,N-diethyI-N'.-benzoylthiourea and N,N-di(n-butyl)-N'-benzoylthiourea /14, 26/.
By comparison with the structure ofthe free ligand HL,the bond lengths ofthe thiocarbonyl moieties [C(I)-
S(1) 1.74(2), C( ")-S( ") 1.76(1) ] and carbonyl [C(1)-O(1).31(2), C( ")-O( ") 1.37(2) ] in the complex
cis-[Pt(L)_] are on average longer (1.75 and 1.34 , respectively) than those in the ligand HL
(C=S 1.664(2) and C=O 1.209(3) ,respectively) while the corresponding two contiguous C-N bond lengths
(N(I)-C(I and N(I)-C(2)) ofthe complex cis-[Pt(L)2] are on average shorter (1.25 and 1.36/, respectively)
compared to HL (N(I)-C(I) 1.389(3), N(1)-C(2) 1.391(3) ). These results confirm the decrease of
the bond orders ofthe carbonyl and thiocarbonyl groups upon complexation and, together with the changes in
the C-N bond lengths, indicate the presence of an extensive delocalization of electron density in the chelate
ring of the complex cis-lPt(L)2l; furthermore this is confirmed by IR, H-NMR and 95pt-NMR
spectroscopy.

3.3. Antitumor evaluation
The cytotoxic activity of the acylthiourea ligands and their platinum (II) complexes were evaluated on
TA3 tumor cell line. Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the concentration-dependent inhibitory effects for HL,HLz,
is-[Pt(L)z] and cis-lPt(LZ)z] on the growth of TA3 tumor cell line, respectively. In Figure 3, it can be

observed that the ligand HL is more cytotoxic than HL in the range of 40-60 tM while cis-[Pt(L)] and
cis-[Pt(L2)2] exhibited higher cytotoxic activities than the ligands (Figs. 4 and 5). A similar level of cellular
growth inhibition was obtained for cis-lPt(L2h] and HL in the range of 1-10 and 20-60 tM, respectively. A
strong inhibition of the cell proliferation was shown by the complexes cis-lPt(Lh and cis-[Pt(L2)2] at the
concentration of 10 tM, where the toxicity was drastically increased and the cell survival was completely
inhibited at 72 h of exposure. These results indicate that the cytotoxic activity is enhanced when the ligands
HL or HL are coordinated to Pt(II). Probably the cis-[PtL2] complexes can be easily transported through
cellular membrane as a result oftheir high hydrophobicity and thus exert their cytotoxicity on cellular DNA.
Figure 6 shows the cytotoxic effect for the cis-[Pt(L)2] and cis-[Pt(L)2] complexes with respect to the
ligands HL and HL on the percentage of cell survival at 48 h of exposure on culture medium. While the
ligand HL was only about 20 % more cytotoxic than HL,cis-lPt(L)2] and cis-[Pt(L2)2] were much more
cytotoxic than their respective ligands HL or HL2. This demonstrates that the presence of a nitro group on
the benzoyi moiety may be important in some degree on the growth inhibition of the TA3 tumor cell line for
HL2, whereas in the cytotoxicity of the platinum (II) complexes, the participation of nitro group is slightly
relevant, and rather the hydrophobicity of these cis-[PtL2] complexes plays an important role in the cytotoxic
activity/30-32/.

A comparison of IC50 values for the tested compounds is provided in Table 3. The iigand HL with a nitro
substituent group showed greater cytotoxicity (34.9 pM) compared to HL (23.1 pM), whereas the cytotoxic
activities of their cis-[PtL2] complexes were about ten times higher than their respective ligands. The ICs0
values of the cis-[Pt(L)2] and cis-[Pt(L2)2] complexes (2.8 and 2.6 laM, respectively) turned out to be
slightly better than cisplatin (ICs0 4.2 + 1.2 laM), evaluated on oesophageal tumor cells (carcinoma)/33/.
These results demonstrate that the bis-chelate cis-[Pt(L)2] and cis-[Pt(L2)2] complexes, with a square-planar
geometry play an important role in the inhibition ofTA3 tumor cell growth.

In summary, we have prepared the bis-chelate complexes cis-[Pt(Ll)2l and cis-[Pt(L2)2], which are more
cytotoxic on the TA3 tumor cell line at micromolar concentration compared to acylthiourea ligands, HL and
HL Moreover, it was demonstrated that the participation of the nitro substituent group in the para position
of benzoyl moiety in HL slightly increases its cytotoxic activity with respect to ligand HL,whereas, in
comparison to complex activities, this substitution is irrelevant. These results could represent an important
contribution to establish some mechanism of action of bis-chelate complexes, cis-[PtL2] (not analogous to
cisplatin) related to cellular DNA.
