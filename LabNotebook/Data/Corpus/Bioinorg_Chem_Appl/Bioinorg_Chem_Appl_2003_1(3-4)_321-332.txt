ABSTRACT
For modelling the interactions of proteins/peptides with hard metal ions the complex formation of
salicylglycine (SalGly) with Ca(II), Mg(ll) and AI(III) ions was studied in aqueous solution using pH-
potentiometric and UV-vis spectroscopic techniques. Al(lll) ion was found to form more stable complexes
with SalGiy than Ca(ll) or Mg(ll) ions. While AI(III) ion forms various 1:1 complexes of different
protonation states in the pH range 2-7, Ca(ll), Mg(ll) ions seem to interact with SalGly only in the basic pH
range and form mixed hydroxo species MLH_ at pH 8. According to the UV-vis spectroscopic
measurements in the species MLH_ the carboxylate-O- atom and the phenolate-O- coordinate to the metal
ions. SaIGiy is able to keep Al(lll) in solution through inner and outer sphere coordination to metastable
amorphous AI(OH)3 particles. Deprotonation ofthe peptide amide Nil does not occur in these systems.

INTRODUCTION
The active site of a metailoenzyme usually consists of several donor atoms or groups in a special
arrangement to be able to bind metal ions. The metal centre formed is responsible for the activity of the
enzyme. Redox or non-redox metal ions can be involved in metalioenzymes depending on the type of
reactions they catalyse. In order to understand the role of the metal ions in mechanism of enzymes and
developing new synthetic metalloenzymes, it is necessary to know more about the interaction of metal ions
with peptides and proteins. Large number of metalloenzymes have been crystallised and their structure
characterised by X-ray diffraction. Often the dynamic structures and catalytic properties of the enzyme in
solution are clarified by muitinuclear NMR techniques, when changes in the active site of the enzyme during

the catalytic cycle are monitored. Besides this approach, the structural and functional modelling of the active
Site of metalloenzymes is another way to obtain the desired information. Zn(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), Ca(II)
and Mg(II) metal ions are frequently present in metalloenzymes, hence their complexes with relevant model
molecules are the most studied. There are also many other metal ions, which are not essential elements, but
they may influence the activity of enzymes. One of these metal ions is AI(III). The detrimental role ofAl(III)
in many biological, enzymatic processes is well documented/1-4/. In many cases the toxicity of Al(III) is
linked to its ability to replace Ca(II) or Mg(II) ions in their biological environment and in this way to
interfere with their reactions in biological systems /5/. In this paper the coordination behaviour of
Salicyiglycine (SalGly) with Ca(I'I), Mg(II) and AI(III) has been investigated by pH-metry and UV-vis
spectroscopic method.
SalGly (Figure 1) is a hydrolysis product resulting from glycine conjugation with salicylic acid and it is a

SalGly as a dipeptide analogue may be a good model compound to study the metal-peptide/protein
interaction, which can have further applications in clarifying the interactions of the toxic AI(III) in biological
systems. SalGly contains a carboxyl group, a peptide amide group and a phenolic OH group as potential
donors for the metal ion binding. The phenolic OH group may be a suitable anchoring donor for hard metal
ion and may play a crucial role in the deprotonation and subsequent coordination of the peptide amide.
Stability constants of SalGly with Cu(II), Ni(II), Zn(II), Co(II) /7-9/ and VO(IV) ions/10/were determined
previously. SalGly proved to be a relatively strong binder of these transition metal ions. With Cu(II) and
VO(IV) ions an MLH_I complex is predominantly formed in the pH range 4-6. In this complex the ligand
coordinates to the metal ion trough the phenolate, carboxylate oxygen atom and the deprotonated peptide
nitrogen through a (5+6)-membered joint chelate system. With Ni(II) and Zn(II) ions SalGly forms
mononuclear complexes ML and MLH_I. In the complex MLH_, SalGly binds to these metal ions in a
bidentate way through the phenolate and carboxylate donors and a proton is liberated from a coordinated
water molecule.
These studies reveal that Cu(ll) and VO(IV) ions favour deprotonation and coordination of the peptide
amide, while it does not occur in the Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Reagents:
Salicylglycine (2-hydroxyhippuric acid), of highest analytical purity (Aldrich product) was used without
further purification. The exact concentration ofthe ligand solution was determined by potentiometric titration
using the Gran method /11/. The Ca(II) and Mg(II) solutions were prepared from Fluka products,
CaC12.2H20, and MgCI2 .6H20, puriss. >99% quality and their concentrations were checked by
complexometric titrations. The AI(III) stock solution was prepared from recrystallized AICI3.6H20 md its
metal concentration was determined gravimetrically via its oxinate. The stock solution contained 0.1 M HC1
to prevent hydrolysis ofAI(III).
Potentiometric Measurements:
The stability constants of the proton and metal ion complexes of the ligand were determined by pH-
potentiometric titrations of 10 mL samples. The ligand concentration was 0.002 M or 0.004 M. Titrations
were performed with a 0.2 M carbonate-free KOH solution of known concentration under a purified argon
atmosphere. The measurements were carried out at metal ion to ligand ratios of 0"1, 0:4, 1"1, 1:2, 1:4 for
Ca(ll) and Mg(II) ion, while at 0:1, 0:4, 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, 1:11, 1:16 for AI(III) ion. The ionic strength of all
solutions was adjusted to 0.2 M with KC1 and the temperature was 25 + 0. IC. The titrations were performed
until precipitation occurred in the systems. The reproductibility of the titration curves was within 0.01 pH
units through the whole pH range. When equilibrium could not be reached in 10 min, titration points were
omitted from the calculations. The pH range studied was 2-11 for Ca(If), Mg(II) ion and until precipitation
occurred for Al(III) ion. The pH was measured with a Moispin Automatic Titrator equipped with Metrohm
6.0234.100 type combined glass electrode, which was calibrated for the hydrogen ion concentration
according to Irving at al./12/. The stability constants ([pqr [MpLqHr]/[M]P[L]q[H]r) were calculated with the
aid of the PSEQUAD computer program/13/. The fitting parameter, which characterises the goodness of the
fit and represents the average difference between experimental and calculated titration curves, is expressed in
mL of the titrant. The stability constants used for the hydroxo species of AI(III), Mg(II) and Ca(If) were
taken from ref. /14,15/and corrected to 0.2 using the Davies equation:-5.49 for [A1H___]2+,-10.91 for
[A1H_2]+, -13.54 for [AI3H_4]5+, -108.62 for [Al3H_32]7+, -23.40 for [AIH_4]-, and-11.91 for [MgH_]+,
-37.09 for [Mg4H_4]4+
and-14.14 for [CaH._]+.
Spectrophotometric measurements:
UV-vis spectra were recorded on a HP 8452A diode array spectrometer in 0.5 cm quartz cell in the 200-
500 nm spectral range on solutions containing 2.10-4
M ligand, ofmetal ion to ligand molar ratios of 0:1, 1:2,
1:8. The pH range studied was 3-12. The ionic strength was adjusted to 0.2 M with KCI.

Dynamic light scattering measurements:
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed using a ZetaSizer 4 (Malvern, U.K.)
apparatus operating at ) 633 nm produced by a He-Ne laser at angle 90 at 25 +_ 0.1 C. The light scattering
was measured in 10 mL samples containing AI(III) alone and AI(III) and the ligand at the same concentration
as for potentiometric measurements (cga,,d 4"10-3
M) and at 1:8 the metal ion to ligand ratio. The pH of
dilute systems was adjusted in the pH range 4-7 and measured directly before the sample was placed into the
quartz cell. The pH-dependent particle aggregation was measured at 0.2 M KC1 constant ionic strength.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Potentiometric Measurements
Potentiometric titrations of SalGly indicate the stepwise dissociation of two protons in the measurable pH
range, one from the carboxylic group with pK 3.38 and one from phenolic hydroxyl group with pK 8.11.
The measured values are in reasonably good agreement with the earlier literature data (see Table 1).

A comparison of the pK values of SalGly with those of glycine, pK(COOH) 2.37 and pK(NH3+) 9.60
and glycyl-glycine with pK(COOH) 3.21 and pK(NH3+) 8.13 shows that the pK 3.38 value of
carboxylic group of SalGly is close to that of the dipeptides/16/. The pK 8.11 value of phenolic-OH group
of SalGly is close to that of the terminal amino group of GlyGly. Accordingly, concerning the donor group
arrangement and the basicity of the donors, SalGly is a good model for peptides, however, the neutral-NH2
terminus is replaced by a negatively charged O- donor, which may be a more suitable anchor for hard metal
ions.
The stability constants (log(13) calculated by the joint evaluation of the titration curves obtained at various
metal ion to ligand ratios for Ca(II)-, Mg(II)- and AI(III)-SalGly systems are listed in Table 2.

Evaluation of the titration data for Ca(If)-, Mg(II)-SalGly led to a model including only a single
mononuclear hydroxo complex MLH_ (or more precisely ML(OH)), which occurs at pH > 8. Other
mononuclear species MLH, ML were rejected by the computer program. Due to the high proton competition
on the phenolate site, coordination occurs only at low hydrogen ion concentration in overlapping processes of
the hydrolysis of the metal ion resulting in the formation of a ternary mixed hydroxo complex. The
interaction of SalGly with these metal ions is rather weak (their stability constants are similar), represented
by the fact that the extent of complexation hardly reaches 10 % at a ten fold excess of ligand at pH 8.
pH-potentiometry is not the best method to determine such low stability constants, and thus very few stability
data have been published in the literature on alkali-metal complexes/17-20/. The clearly observed higher
absorbance in the UV spectra of the ligand in the presence of metal ions, as compared with that in the
absence of Mg(II) or Ca(If) ions, unambiguously prove the coordination ofthe metal ions.
The complex formation with AI(III) is more complicated because of the more complex hydrolytic
equilibrium of the AI(III) ion. In order to prevent precipitation of the neutral AI(OH)3, pH-metric
measurements were performed at high excesses of ligand, too. Depending on the metal ion to ligand ratio,
precipitation occurred at different pH values at pH 4.7 for 1"1 metal to ligand ratio, in the range of pH 5.2-
5.5 for 1:2 and 1:4 metal to ligand ratio, while only at pH 7 for the 1:8 or higher metal ion to ligand ratio.
The equilibrium titration data for Al(lII)-SalGly system were evaluated by a speciation model including
mononuclear complexes in different protonation states AILH, AlL, AILH_ and AILH_2 (see Table 2). The
formation of various dinuclear species was also tested in the evaluation, but these species were always
rejected in the calculation procedure. In the pH ranges indicated above, complex formation was fast; pH
equilibrium was reached in less than 5 min, thus formation of oligonuclear complexes in such low AI(III)
concentrations seemed to be negligible. The interaction of Al(lIl) with SalGly is significantly stronger than
with Ca(If) and Mg(II) ions. As seen in the speciation curves (Figure 2) complex formation is practically
complete by pH 5 at an eight-fold excess of ligand.
Figure 2 reveals that complex formation starts at pH 2 with a protonated complex A1LH. In this

complex the ligand probably coordinates in a monodentate way through the terminal COO- function (see
structure I, Chart 1), with the possible chelation through the peptide carbonyl (see structure II, Chart 1) as
was suggested for the corresponding Cu(II) complex too/7/.
Increasing the pH, the protonated species A1LH undergoes stepwise deprotonations with a pK 3.13,
4.90 and 4.93 and forms finally the complex A1LH_2. The liberation of these protons occurs in overlapping
processes from the phenolic-OH group and the coordinated water molecules, resulting in the formation of
different binding isomers shown in Chart 1. For example liberation of the first proton may occur (i) from the
phenolic-OH group, resulting in the bidentate (COO-, O-) coordination of the ligand (See Structure III in
Chart 1) with a possible involvement of the peptide carbonyl through the formation of a 6+6 membered joint
chelate system/7/(see Structure IV in Chart 1), or (ii) from one of the coordinated water molecules, which
assume monodentate carboxylate coordination of the ligand, with protonated phenolic-OH group with a
possible involvement of the peptide carbonyl group. In these latter cases the low pK(AIL) value of 3.13 may
be interpreted by the formation of a strong hydrogen-bonding between the phenolic-OH and the coordinated
OH- (see Structure 'V in Chart 1) and/or a change in the coordination geometry from octahedral to tetrahedral
/21, 22/. Liberation of the next proton will result in the formation of a mixed hydroxo species with either
bidentate (COO-, O-) or tridentate (COO-, CO, O-) coordination of the ligand (Structures VI and VII,
respectively in Chart 1).
The rather low pK value of species AILH_I (pK(AILH_I) 4.90), which is 0.59 log unit lower than the pK
of the [Al(H20)6]3+
5.49 may suggest also the presence of a hydrogen bonding with the coordinated OH-.
On increasing the pH a further deprotonation takes place with (pK(A1LH_2) 4.93). Probably, a second
coordinated water molecule dissociates and the mixed bis hydroxo complex AlL(OH)2 is formed. Another
alternative interpretation of this deprotonation step is the assumption of an outer-sphere complex formation
between the metastable non-precipitated AI(OH)3 and the protonated (on the phenolic function) form of the
ligand HL-. Al(III)-ligand systems frequently exist in metastable states when solubility product should
predict precipitation; the solution may be clear even for days/23/. At pH 6 the slight precipitation observed

at low excess of ligand was completely redissolved by pH -8, resulting again in clear solution. The stability
constants of the AI(III) species are higher than those of the analogous Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of
the SalGly/7/. This can be explained by the higher charge of the AI3+, which results in a significantly higher
electrostatic contribution to the stability of AI(III) complexes and points to the primarily electrostatic
character ofthe interaction.

Spectrophotometric measurements
The suggested binding modes of the different complexes were confirmed by spectrophotometric
measurements. Using this method the protonation state of the phenolic-OH group could be monitored by UV-
vis spectrometry as the phenolic-OH group has a characteristic band at 298 nm, which is shifted to 326 nm
upon deprotonation. The metal binding strength of the phenolate group is considerably higher than in the
protonated form/24, 25/. The UV-vis spectra of SalGly in the absence and in the presence of AI(III) at
different pH values are depicted in Figure 3 (a and b).
As seen in Fig. 3a, the phenolic OH is protonated in acidic solution and gives a band between 2"70 and
340 nm with maximum at 298 nm in the pH range 3-6. On increasing the pH, a new band develops at 326
rim, corresponding to the deprotonation of phenolic OH group. The isobestic point observed at 307 nm
indicates two species in equilibrium: the phenolic function being either in protonated or deprotonated form.
The presence of Ca(If) or Mg(II) ion has only a slight effect on the UV-vis spectra of the ligand,
indicating that these metal ions can induce deprotonation of the phenolic OH only weakly. At pH > 6 when
the ligand starts to deprotonate by itself, these metals are able to bind the ligand in the MLH_ complex by

chelation through the carboxylate and phenolate groups.
The UV-vis spectra of Al(III)-SalGly system recorded at different values in the pH range 3-12 also
consists oftwo bands at 298 nm and 326 nm (see Figure 3b). In acidic solution (pH < 4) the band ofphenolic
OH group (298 nm) is the dominant one. The absorbance of the band at 326 nm, characteristic to the
phenolate group, increases upon increasing the pH up to -5 (see Figure 3b) and results in the disappearance
of the band at 298 nm. This indicates the AI(III) induced deprotonation of the phenolic OH and the
subsequent coordination to Al(Ill). At pH > 5, when the species AlL(OH)2 starts to be formed the absorbance
belonging to the phenolate group decreases, which can be explained by the assumption of the re-protonation
ofthe phenolate group accompanied by its release from the coordination sphere ofAl(lll).
In the pH range 3-6 the formation of complex AILH_ can be detected by both UV-vis spectroscopy and
pH-potentiometry. Comparing the species distribution curves (see Figure 2) with the change of the
absorbance measured at 326 nm as a function of pH (see Figure 4), we can conclude that only the species
A1LH_ contains deprotonated and AI(III) coordinated phenolate group. Both the potentiometric and the
spectrophotometric measurements show a maximum at pH 5, when approximately 30% of AI(III) is
complexed in the species AILH_ (Figure 2). Accordingly, in this complex the bidentate (COO-, O-)
coordination of the ligand is the most likely binding mode (see Structures IIl and IV in Chart 1). Interestingly
enough, the direct coordination of the phenolate group of SalGly to Al(III) in species AlL(OH)2 is not
confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy. The re-protonation of the phenolate group in the formation pH range of
species AlL(OH)2 can occur only through the displacement of the phenolate group from the coordination
sphere of the Al(III) by a further OH-. Accordingly, the binding mode of AlL(OH)2 may be the direct
monodentate COO- coordination of the ligand to the metastable form of AI(OH)3 and solubilization and
stabilization of the species through outer-sphere hydrogen bonding with the protonated phenolic-OH and the
carbonyI-O functions, resulting in a species written precisely by the formula AI(OH)3(HL). Since the UV-vis
spectra ofthe SalGly in the presence and the absence ofAI(III) does not appreciably differ in the pH range 7-
12, where the ligand is completely displaced by OH- resulting in the formation of the very stable [AI(OH)4]-,

deprotonation of amide nitrogen cannot be assumed in the systems studied. This suggests that the phenolic-
OH group of SalGly is an efficient donor group to prevent hydrolysis of these metal ions but not strong
enough to promote amide deprotonation in the Ca(ll)-, Mg(ll)-, AI(III)-SalGIy systems. Perhaps, more
negatively charged O donor groups in suitable arrangement are required, if at all, to promote the
deprotonation and participation ofthe amide-N- in binding such hard metal ions.
Dynamic light scattering measurements
In order to study the aggregation processes resulting in precipitation at pH > 6 in the AI(III)-SalGIy
system, and to clarify more precisely the binding mode in the complex AILH_2, dynamic light scattering
measurements were also carried out. The aggregation processes in dilute suspensions can be characterised by
particle size determination. Dynamic light scattering method (DLS) can provide reliable particle size data
even, when the system is undergoing coagulation/26/. The complete elucidation of the aggregation features
of the AI(III)-SalGIy system would need extensive DLS measurements, including kinetic studies. However,
as the aggregation process is very complicated.and the information that these results may provide is only
approximate and indirect concerning the AI(III) binding behaviour to the ligand SalGly, we did not attempt to
explore this field in depth, but used DLS only to obtain several basic characteristics for the binding mode in
AILH_2.
Comparing the results obtained for the samples containing AI(III) alone and AI(III) and SalGly at a 1:8
ratio at different pH values, the formation of solid particles, presumably AI(OH)3 was observed at different
pH values: at pH 4.7 for samples containing AI(III) alone, at pH 6 for the Al(lll)-ligand 1:8 system. This
is the pH range where the complex AILH_2 predominates in solution (see Figure 2). In the absence of SalGly
approximately 2-6 times bigger particles were formed than in the AI(III)-SalGIy system. The adsorption or
outer-sphere binding of the ligand on the surface of AI(OH)3 nanoparticles was pH dependent; the extent of
adsorption of SalGly increased with increasing pH. These observations suggest that the direct or outer-sphere
coordination of the ligand to AI(III) has a great influence on the aggregation behaviour of the AI(OH)3
nanoparticles. Namely, SalGly through the formation of the proposed outer-sphere type complex A1LH_2 or
more precisely AI(OH)3 .HL hinders aggregation.
CONCLUSION
The speciation studies indicate a weak interaction of SalGly with Ca(ll), Mg(ll) and AI(III) ions.
Mononuclear 1:1 complexes are formed in these systems. In the case of Ca(If) and Mg(II) only the mixed
hydroxo species MLH_ (more precisely ML(OH)) occurs at pH > 8, while in the Al(III)-SalGly system
various 1"1 complexes of different protonation states are formed in the pH range 2-6.5. In the complexes
AILH and AlL the phenolic-OH group of SalGly remains protonated (see Structures II and IV in Chart I).
The UV-vis spectral changes (see Figure 4) provide convincing evidence that the phenolic-OH is
deprotonated in the species AILH_t. In this complex SalGly is possibly bound in a tridentate (COO-, CO, O-)
way and an OH- is also bound to the metal ion (see Structure VII in Chart I). In the species AILH_2, tbrmed

at pH > 5.5, besides the direct coordination through the CO0- donor the phenolic-OH is assumed to be in
hydrogen bonding with the metastable hydrolytic product of AI(III). The question is whether this .type of
complex formed between a nanosize particle and the ligand HL- is stochiometric or not. Probably the
association is equimolar: AI(OH)3.HL. Similar outer-sphere interaction was observed in the phosphate uptake
by AI(OH)3 precipitated in situ, or by aged AI(OH)3/27/. Depending on the excess of ligand, precipitation
occurred in the pH range 4.7-7.5, which was hindered by the presence of SalGly. At pH-8 the precipitate
dissolved through the formation of AI(OH)4-. No indication of deprotonation of the peptide amide group was
observed in this pH range.
The results obtained indicate that AI(III) may be kept in solution not only by direct coordination, but also
in metastable forms through outher sphere complexation in biologycal systems.
