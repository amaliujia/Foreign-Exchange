1. INTRODUCTION
The synthesis and structural investigations of thiosemicarbazones and their metal complexes are of considerable
centre of attention because of their potentially beneficial
pharmacological properties and a wide variation in their modes of
bonding and stereochemistry 
[–]. Coordination chemistry
of mixed hard-soft NS donor ligands is a field of current
interest. The most important factor in this objective is probably
the design of ligands with an appropriate structural backbone.
Thiosemicarbazones that are most widely studied are sulphur and nitrogen consisting ligands 
[, ]. Besides,
thiosemicarbazones have emerged as an important sulphur containing ligands in the last two
decades [–]. The real impetus towards coordination chemistry is the wide range of biological properties depending on
parent aldehyde or ketone including antitumour 
[, ],
antibacterial, and antifungal 
[, ] properties as well as
their physicochemical effects [, ]. In addition of this, they have been screened for their medicinal properties because
they possess some cytotoxic effect. They also stabilize uncommon
oxidation states, generate a different coordination number in
transition metal complexes in order to participate in various
redox reactions [, ]. It is well known that several metal ions enhance and modify the biological activities of
thiosemicarbazones, the new metals to such a list are ruthenium
[] and rhodium []. Much attention has been drawn towards the chemistry of ruthenium 
[, ] and rhodium [] in different coordination spheres. Due to different
oxidation states of ruthenium and rhodium their reactivity depends
upon stability of oxidation states. In view of this
ruthenium(III), thiosemicarbazones with nitrogen and sulphur as
donor atoms have been found to be very efficient catalysts in the
oxidation of alcohols and alkenes []. With the growing
interest of thiosemicarbazones of ruthenium and rhodium metal ions, here we report the synthesis, 
characterization, and biological activities of the ruthenium(III) and rhodium(III)
thiosemicarbazones obtained by condensation of the ring-substituted 4-phenylthiosemicarbazide and
4-nitrophenylthiosemicarbazide with anisaldehyde, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4-fluorobenzaldehyde, and vanillin.
Biological activities of the complexes and ligands have also been
carried out against bacteria Bacillus subtilis and
Pseudomonos aeruginosa in vitro. The ligands used in the
study are of the type depicted in .

2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Materials

					RuCl3 · 3H2O 
and RhCl3 · 3H2O 
and other chemicals were purchased from Merck and Loba chemie, Bombay,
India, and were used without further purification.

The antibacterial activity of the ligands and their complexes were
tested by using paper disc diffusion method [] against
Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Nutrient agar medium was prepared by using peptone, beef extract,
NaCl, agar-agar, distilled water, and 5 mm diameter
paper discs (whatman No.1) were used. The test organisms were
dissolved in ethanol to a concentrations of 1000 and 500 ppm
and soaked in filter paper discs of 5 mm diameter and 1 mm
in thickness. These paper discs were kept in a petri dishes (well
sterilized) previously seeded with test organisms. The plates were
incubated for 24–30 hours at 28 ± 2°C. The zone of
inhibition was calculated in mm carefully. Streptomycin was used
as standard. The composition of test media is the factor, which often exerts the greatest effect upon the  drug
activity. This is particularly true in the case of thiosemicarbazones.

2.2. Synthesis of the ligands
4-phenylthiosemicarbazide and 4-nitrophenylthiosemicar-bazide were prepared from the appropriate amines by using a standard method []. The thiosemicarbazone ligands 
()
were prepared by equimolar quantities of 0.02 mol of each
anisaldehyde (2.72 g), 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (2.80 g),
 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (2.48 g) and vanillin
(3.04 g) in 10 mL ethanol with an ethanolic
solution (25 mL) of 4-phenyl thiosemicarbazide (3.34 g,
0.02 mol)/4-nitrophenyl-thiosemicarbazide (4.24 g,
0.02 mol). The reaction mixtures were then refluxed on a water
bath for 1 hour. Few drops of acetic acid were added during
reflux. As precipitate appeared, the reaction mixture was allowed
to reflux more along with stirring for 2 hours. The residue formed
was separated out, filtered off, washed several times with water,
recrystallized from ethanol, and finally dried in vacuo over fused
calcium chloride. The proposed chemical structures of the
thiosemicarbazone ligands are known to be in good agreement with
the ratios concluded from analytical data 
(see ).

2.3. Synthesis of the complexes
[M(L)3]Cl3  (M = Ru(III), 
	Rh(III); L = HAPT, HCBPT, HFBPT and HVPT)

Hydrated RuCl3 
(0.261 g, 0.001 mol) and RhCl3 (0.263 g, 0.001 mol) in ethanol (10 mL)
were heated, then metal trichloride solution was suspended in
0.003 mol of each ligand viz. HAPT (2.56 g), HCBPT
(2.60 g), HFBPT (2.45 g), and HVPT (2.70 g) in ethanol
(20 mL). The reaction mixtures were refluxed for 9–12 hours.
The precipitates formed were cooled, filtered off, and washed with
hot water, hot ethanol, and finally with diethyl ether, and dried
in vacuo over fused calcium chloride. The yields were 60–70%.

[M(L)3]Cl3  (M = Ru(III), 
	Rh(III); L = HANPT, HCBNPT, HFBNPT and HVNPT)

Hydrated RuCl3 
(0.261 g, 0.001 mol) and RhCl3 (0.263 g, 0.001 mol) in ethanol (10 mL) 
were suspended in 20 mL ethanolic solution of the ligands viz.
HANPT (2.97 g), HCBNPT (3.00 g), HFBNPT (2.86 g), and HVNPT (3.11 g). The reaction mixtures were heated for few
minutes, one equivalent of ethanolic solution of the 
NaOH was added and the reaction mixtures were refluxed for 9-10 hours. The compound, which was precipitated out, was filtered off, washed with water, cold ethanol, and diethyl ether, and dried in vacuo over fused calcium chloride. The yields were 60–76%.

2.4. Analyses
Microanalyses were performed at Elementar Vario III Carlo Erba
1108 in Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India. IR
spectra of the ligands and their complexes have been recorded in
KBr pellets at Shimadzu FTIR 8201 spectrophotometer in 
4000–200 cm−1. Electronic spectra of the complexes were recorded in CHCl3 with a Perkin Elmer Lambda 15 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. 
1H and 13C NMR were obtained with a Bruker DRX 300 spectrometer in CDCl3 using TMS as standard. Sulphur was estimated gravimetrically as BaSO4. The percentage of nitrogen was estimated by
Kjeldahl method. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on powder
form of the complexes were recorded with a Gouy's balance by using
mercuric tetrathiocyanato cobaltate(II) as a calibrant at
25°C. Molar conductance was carried out in 
10−3 M solution of DMF. Thermogravimetric analyses were obtained at 10°C min−1 in the 25–750°C using a Shimadzu TGA-50 H analyzer. A standard method was used for determining metal ions and chlorides volumetrically and
gravimetrically [].

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The complexes were synthesized by reacting ligands with metal ions in 3 : 1 molar ratio in ethanolic medium. 
Thiosemicarbazones were expected to behave as a bidentate with sulphur and nitrogen as donor atoms or coordination sites 
(see ). The present thiosemicarbazone ligands exist as the thione form since
it has −NH−C=S thioamide group; although, in many instances, thiol form or equilibrium mixture of both forms has been observed in thiosemicarbazones. All the ruthenium(III) complexes being d5 (low spin), 
S = 1/2
behave as paramagnetic and rhodium(III) complexes being 
d6 (low spin), S = 0 act as diamagnetic. The analytical data, magnetic susceptibility, and spectral analyses agree well with the proposed composition of formed complexes. All the complexes have
shown good solubility in all the common organic solvents but were
found insoluble in ether, water, acetone, and benzene. All the
complexes are amorphous powder, stable at room temperature and do
not show any decomposition on standing for several months. The
molar conductance of the complexes in DMF lies in the range
280–315 Ω−1 cm2mol−1 indicating their electrolytic behavior and confirms the ionic nature of the chloride ion. Thus the complexes may be formulated as 
[M(L)3]Cl3 (where M = Ru(III), 
Rh(III); L = HAPT, HANPT, HCBPT, HCBNPT, HFBPT, HFBNPT, HVPT, and HVNPT).

The presence of chloride ions in outer sphere was tested both
qualitatively and quantitatively and found very positive.


4. INFRARED SPECTRA
The tentative infrared absorption frequencies of the ligands and
their metal complexes along with their assignments are listed in
. The ligands can act either in keto or in enolic form, depending upon the conditions (e.g., pH of the medium, oxidation state of the metal ion). All physicochemical properties of the complexes support bidentate chelation of the ligands by the azomethine nitrogen and by thione sulphur. This fact was further supported by the bands including azomethine nitrogen ν(C=N) at 
1610–1594 cm−1 in
ligands and the lowering of this band in complexes results in
chelation of the nitrogen to metal ion [, ]. A medium band
at 1030–1020 cm−1 which is assigned to ν(N−N) in ligands is shifted to the higher frequency in the spectra of all complexes. This kind of shift on hydrazinic nitrogen described the presence of electron withdrawing
substituents []. However, in metal complexes the band shifts to higher wave number and splits, which is probably the result of the increase in the multiplicity of the C−N bond. A strong band 
at 872–827 cm−1 in ligands
is mainly due to the ν(C=S) stretching vibration
which shifted towards lower frequency and occurred at
860–820 cm−1 in metal complexes indicating the coordination of thione sulphur to metal atom 
[]. This also described a considerable change in bond order and a metal-sulphur bond. As the ν(S−H) band also remains absent,
this confirms thione form of the ligand. In ligands as well as in
complexes, the peak of ν(N−H) has been observed at 2842–2830 cm−1, which described no prominent change hence, deprotonation of ligands was not observed. Sharp and strong bands in continuous study of the spectra were observed as prominent peaks as 
ν(M−N) [],
ν(M−S) [] at 560–520 and at 460–400 cm−1, respectively.

5. ELECTRONIC SPECTRA
All of the formed complexes have been found to be in +3
oxidation state. Ruthenium(III) complexes act as paramagnetic one
and rhodium(III) complexes are diamagnetic. Electronic spectral
data are given in . The ground state of ruthenium(III) is 2T2g and the first excited doublet levels in order of increasing energy are 2A2g and 2T1g which are known to arise from t2g4e1g configuration []. The ruthenium(III) complexes display electronic spectra with transition at 13500–14000 cm−1, 17240–18300 cm−1,  and 23280–23800 cm−1 which may be assigned to 2T2g → 4T1g, 2T2g → 4T2g, and 2T2g → 2A2g, 2T1g in increasing order of energy. The B, C, and 10 Dq parameters were calculated using the following equations []:



The values of these ligand field parameters are comparable to
those reported for other trivalent ruthenium complexes involving
nitrogen, sulphur donor molecules 
[]. The values are ca. 70–90% of the free ion values. The considerable
decrease in the Racah interelectronic repulsion parameter, B,
suggests the presence of strong covalent bonding between the donor
and the metal ions. The overall effect will be an increase in the
observed Dq value; high Dq values are usually associated with
considerable electron delocalization []. Rhodium(III) complexes exhibit electronic spectra with transitions at 17260–17650 cm−1, 20210–20960 cm−1, and
27170–28590 cm−1. These bands resemble to those of
reported transitions for other hexacoordinated rhodium complexes
[]. The ground state for rhodium(III) ion is 1A1g in octahedral field, although in many instances only 1A1g → 1T1g spin allowed ligand field
transitions to be observed. These transitions correspond to the 1A1g → 3T1g, 1A1g → 1T1g, and 1A1g → 1T2g, respectively, which agree well with an octahedral geometry. The B and 10 Dq values were calculated from the positions of their electronic bands using the following equations:


			

The ratios of the energies of ν2 and ν1 are in the range 1.32–1.37. 
The B values are 57–67% of the free ion value.
The decrease in B values from the free ion value suggests that
there is a considerable orbital overlap with strong covalency in
the metal ligand σ bond [].


6. MAGNETIC MOMENTS
The room temperature magnetic moments of all the ruthenium(III)
thiosemicarbazone complexes lie in the range 
1.08–1.90 B.M., which are expected to be lower than the predicted value of 2.10 B.M. This lowering may occur due to the presence of lower symmetry ligand fields, metal-metal interactions, or extensive electron delocalization in species  
[]. Rhodium(III)
complexes are diamagnetic and, as expected, this is again
consistent with octahedral geometry of nitrogen and sulphur atoms
producing a strong field 
[].

6.1. 1H and 13C NMR
Coordination of thiosemicarbazones in the rhodium(III) complexes
are further confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectra (see ). The resonance for methoxy protons appeared as a singlet at δ 3.65 ppm in ligands and in complexes no significant change was observed. Significant azomethine proton signal, due to CH=N, was observed at δ 8.02–9.02 ppm region as a multiplet in ligands, and in complexes it has shown a change as a downfield shift and occurred at δ 8.20–9.20 ppm, indicating involvement of nitrogen in coordination. The proton peak of N−H group at δ 10.6–11.2 ppm 
remains the same in the ligands, and in the complexes it suggested that deprotonation do not occur and it has also shown keto form of the ligands. The multiplets as strong bands in region δ 6.2–8.2 ppm were assigned to aromatic ring protons, which also shifted downfield in the complexes.

The 13C NMR spectra revealed the presence of expected number of signals corresponding to different types of carbon atoms present in the compounds. In ligands as well as in complexes, −OCH3 group absorbs at δ 65.0–65.2 ppm and at δ 65.5–65.6 ppm slightly downfield to the methyl
group carbon due to the deshielding of the directly attached
electronegative oxygen atom. No change on complexation to this
group occurs. The spectra of the ligands exhibit a strong band at
δ 179.2–180.2 ppm and are assigned as C=S
group. This band undergoes upfield shift of δ
7.2–7.4 ppm and occurs at δ 171.9–172.8 ppm.
This has shown involvement of thione sulphur in coordination. The
signals due to azomethine carbon occurred at δ 162.3–165.2 ppm as downfield peak, and on complexation they have shown shift to δ 160.5–163.0 ppm due to the resonance and also have given proof that nitrogen is involved in coordination.

7. THERMAL STUDIES
The TGA data reveal that there is a good agreement with the
formulae as suggested from the elemental analyses. The first mass
loss occurs within the temperature range 190–300°C, which
corresponds to the removal of three chloride ions of the outer
sphere as HCl. The number of chelate rings as well as the type of chelate rings around metal ions play an important role in the thermal stability and degradation of the complexes. Furthermore, it is known that the electronegativity and atomic radius of the central metal also affect the thermal stability. No
endothermic peak has been observed, indicating absence of water
molecule. Thermal investigations of [Ru(HAPT)3]Cl3 support the removal of the organic part of the ligand as PhNHCS
fragments in the temperature range 320–360°C. The third step corresponds to the removal of the three molecules of
C7H5OCH3 at temperature range 400–480°C. Final decomposition leaves a mixed residue of Ru2O3−RuO2 at
680–695°C. The same decomposition pattern was observed for other complexes of ruthenium and rhodium leaving residues of RuO2 and Rh2O3, respectively, in the temperature range 710–750°C like a carbonaceous matter.

8. ANTIBACTERIAL STUDIES
The results () exhibit that complexes show moderate activity against Bacillus subtilis and 
Pseudomonos aeruginosa. The toxicity of the complexes was found better than parent ligand owing to the chelation theory of Tweedy []. The [Ru(HVPT)3]Cl3, [Ru(HAPT)3]Cl3, and [Ru(HVNPT)3]Cl3 exhibited higher toxicity; this is due to the presence of electron donating group 
(OCH3) in these complexes while in the same complexes of rhodium better toxicity was also observed. The variation in the toxicity of different complexes against various organisms depends either on the impermeability of the cells of the microbes or differences in ribosome in microbial cells []. The enhanced effect of complexes due to chelation could increase
the lipophilicity of the central metal atom, which favours the
permeation through the lipid layers of the cell wall. On the other
hand, the mode of action of the compounds may involve the
formation of hydrogen bonds through azomethine group of the
complexes with the active centers of cell constituents resulting
in the interference with normal cell process. Besides,
antibacterial activity could not reach the affectivity of the
streptomycin. On the basis of the above studies, the
structures in  
may be formulated for the complexes.
