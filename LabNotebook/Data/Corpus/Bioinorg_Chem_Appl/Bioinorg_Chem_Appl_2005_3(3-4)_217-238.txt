ABSTRACT
Corfiplexes of the type Na6[M(HL)2(H20)2], where M= Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)
and Na3H-,L= 2-(4-sulphophenylazo)-l,8-dihydroxy 3,6 naphthalene disulphonic acid trisodium salt, have
been synthesized and characterized by physico-chemical (elemental analyses, solubility, electrolytic
conductance, magnetic susceptibility measurement) and spectral (UV-Visible, IR, ESR, powder x-ray
diffraction) techniques for their structure and studied for their antifungal activity against ten fungi. The
anionic 1:2 metal:ligand complexes show octahedral geometry around M(II), a significant antifungal activity
against Curvularia lunata and Alternaria triticinaand and a moderate activity against Alternaria brassicicola,
Alternaria brassicae, Alternaria solanae, Curvularia species, Helminthosporium oryzae, Collectotrichum
capsici, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillusflavus and Fusarium udum.
INTRODUCTION
Several azo compounds containing, -N=N- group have been used in colorimetric/1/, chromogenic/2/,
spectrophotometric/3/, complexometric /4/ studies as well as indicators in titrimetric determination of metal
ions/5/, ct-Hydroxy azo compounds are significant due to their use as models for metal-enzyme interactions
and transport of metal ions in biological fluids/6/. Polydentate chelating agents are able to remove metal ions
from metalloenzymes by forming ternary complexes/7/. Coordinating abilities of aromatic -hydroxy azo
dyes namely, 1, 4-bis-p-sulphonylazo-2,3-dihyroxynaphthalene, 4-(2-hydroxy- l-phenylazo)-
benzensulphonate, 4-(2-hydroxy-l-naphthylazo)-benzenesulphonate and 4-(9-hydroxy-10-phenanthrylazo)-
benzenesulphonate, towards Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) show both mono and binuclear chelates
formation/8/. 2-(4-sulphophenylazo)-l,8-dihydroxy 3,6 naphthalene disulphonic acid trisodium salt, Na3H2L

is known to be weak ligand but still forms metal chelates in solution/9/.
Coordination compounds have also been studied as antitumour /10/ antiviral /11/ and antimalerial/12/
agents. The ability of metal ions to form complexes with ligands containing nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur
donor atoms/13/is related to such bioactivity. Schiff base complexes have led to a better understanding of
the factors modifying the coordination sphere and the electronic properties of metals ions, and of chelate
formation. Hydroxy azo compounds are structurally related to the Schiff bases, with an added advantage of
being soluble and stable in water allowing a closure understanding of biological processes. X-ray crystal
structure analysis of azo phenolate derivatives and their metal complexes has been done for bioinorganic
purposes/14, 15/. Complexes of amino acids with sulphonated azo dyes have been used as model systems for
understanding the biomolecular recognition of glycosamino glycans for proteins. Further, sulphonato azo
dyes, Evans blue and Congo Red are being studied as HIV inhibitors of viral replications. The latter effect is
believed to be caused by binding of azo dyes to both protease and reverse transcriptase of this virus/16/.
Metal complexes have been proved to be more fungitoxic compared to the basic organic compound/17/.
Dithocarbamate, morpholine dithiocarbamates and diphenyl dithiocarbamates complexes of Zn(II) Mn(II),
Fe(II) and Cu(II) have been found to be very active against certain fungi, namely Helminthosporium goffybii
and Alternaria solanae. Copper(II) sulphate and copper(II) oxychlorides are very effective against species of
Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Gliocledium, somewhat more on Alternaria, Chaetomium and
Trichothesium/18/. Further, it has been demonstrated that chelation in these compounds, to a large extent, is
responsible for antifungal and antibacterial activity/19/. Transition metal complexes with dyes e.g. Cu(II)
with methyl Orange have also shown pronounced antifungal and antibacterial activity /20/. Copper
complexes of thiophene oligomers have proved to be excellent fungicidal and also possessing other
antimicrobial property against Aspergillus niger. These effects were attributed to a slow release of Cu2/
into
the culture medium, thereby causing inhibition of fungus/21/.
In view of the above studies, our interests have grown in this field. The objective of the present study,
therefore was to synthesize and characterize Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with
title ligand, Na3H2L and to screen these metal complexes against several fungi by studying their antifungal
properties.

Analysis and Physical Measurements
Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Na were estimated by using Perkin-Elmer flame atomic absorption
spectroscopy, model SOLAAR 32AA. Carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen analyses were carried out on a Perkin-
Elmer CHN Elemental Analyzer, model 2400. Combustion temperature was 920C and reduction
temperature was 640C.
Room temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on a Faraday type balance
(Cahn-electronic balance 75570) using catena-tetrathiocyanatocobalt(II) mercury(II), [CoHg(SCN)4] as
standard. Experimental magnetic susceptibility (M) was corrected for diamagnetism using the procedure of
Figgis and Lewis/23/. Electronic spectra (1500-200 nm) of the ligand and complexes were recorded on a
CARY-2390 UV-Visible spectrophotometer in double distilled water using the technique of Lee et al/24/. IR
spectra between 4000-400 cm were recorded on a JASCO FT/IR-5300 spectrophotometer in nujol mulls.
The ESR spectra of Cu(II) complex of NaH2L was recorded on an X-band spectrometer model Varian-E-11
at liquid nitrogen temperature and room temperature in solid state using DPPH (ca-diphenyl, 13-picryl
hydrazyl) as <g> marker. The field setup was 3200 G and scan range was 2000G. Powder X-ray diffraction
data were analysed by Ito's method /25/. Molar conductance of all the water-soluble complexes was
measured at room temperature on a WTW conductivity bridge fitted with Philips magic eye.
Antifungal activity
The fungi were isolated on PDA (250 g peeled potato, 20 g dextrose, 15 g agar powder and 1L distilled
water) medium from their respective hosts collected from the experimental farm of Banaras Hindu University
and incubated for one week at room temperature. The cultures were purified by single spore isolation on
PDA slants.
Aqueous solutions of each metal salt, MnCb_.4H_O, FeSO4.7H20, COSO4.7H20, NiSO,.7H20,
CuSO.5H_O, and ZnSO4.7HO, were prepared by dissolving the required amounts in double distilled water
thereby making concentrations of 1000 ppm. Aqueous solutions of NaHzL was prepared by dissolving the
required amount in double distilled water to make concentrationsof 1000 ppm. Also complexes of metal ions
(Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II)) with the ligands NaHzL were dissolved in the required
amount of double distilled water to make concentrations up to 1000 ppm. These solutions were diluted
further by addition of double distilled water for preparing the required sets of metal mixture solutions,
namely, A, A, Az, B, B, Bz, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.
Antifungal activity of the above metal complexes was studied on various fungi, namely, Alternaria
brassicicola, Alternaria brassicae, Alternaria solanae, Alternaria triticina, Curvularia species, Curvularia
lunata, Helminthosporium oryzae, Collectotrichum capsici, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, and
Fusarium udum, by using the spore germination technique/26/. For comparison, antifungal activity of the
ligands was also determined on the same fungi.
The antifungal activity of the above water-soluble complexes, metal salts and ligands was also studied by
poisoned food technique on the fungi, Curvularia species, Curvularia lunala, Alternaria triticina, Alternaria
brassicicola and Fusariam udum /27/.

A drop of metal-complex solution was placed on a grease-free glass slide and 200-300 spores of the test
fungi were placed with the help of a sterilized inoculation needle on the solution. The slides were then placed
in a moist chamber and incubated at 25 + 2C, for 24 h. After incubation the spores were fixed and stained
with lectophenol cotton blue, and spore germination was observed under a light microscope. Similar spore
numbers of each fungus were mixed in sterilized distilled water, which served as control. For measurement of
inhibition, the percentage germination was subtracted by a hundred to get percentage inhibition. All the
experiments were conducted in triplicate. The data were subjected to students 't' test for statistical
significance.
Mycellial growth of five fungi, with or without chemicals, was observed by taking dry weight of fungi
grown in 150 ml conical flask. All the conical flasks were filled with 50 ml potato dextrose broth. Required
amounts of the chemicals were then added to the broth to get the desired concentrations (250, 500 and 750
ppm) individually and in the mixture and dissolved and mixed thoroughly by shaking the flasks. After
autoclaving for 15 min (at 121C) the broth was allowed to cool down and a 5 mm disc of fungal mycelium
was taken from the border of an actively growing fungal colony and inoculated into the broth. The flasks
were incubated at 25 + 2C for one week.. Potato dextrose broth without the chemicals served as control.
After one week, the broth with the fungal colony was filtered on previously weighed filter papers and dried at
80C for 24 h. The dry weight of the fungal colony was determined by deducting the weight of the filter
paper from the total weight of filter paper and mycelium. All the experiments were conducted in triplicate.
The data were subjected to student 't' test for statistical significance. Antifungal activity measured by these
methods is presented in the Tables (8, 9, 10, 11, 12).
Statistical analysis
The data recorded for different concentrations of metal-complex solutions were subjected to the following
statistical analysis.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
The analysis of variance was carried out separately tbr each fungus against all the compounds at various
concentrations according to the procedure of Randomized Block Design Analysis/28/.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Analytical data of the complexes (Table 1) show that all the complexes of Na3HzL with Mn(II), Fe(II),
Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II), are colored, water soluble and have 1:2 M(II):ligand stoichiometry. The
complexes are partially soluble in ethanol and insoluble in benzene, chloroform and acetone. Electrolytic
conductance data indicate that all the complexes are ionic in nature.

IR Spectra
Aromatic t-hydroxy azo compounds, such as the present ligand, undergo fast intramolecular proton
transfer between the enol-azo form and keto-hydrazone form. This equilibrium has been studied by a variety
of spectroscopic techniques/8/.
Major peaks observed in the spectra of Na3H2L, at 3425, 1628 and 1508 cm1
(Table-2), were assigned to
v(OH), the ring vibrations and v(N=N) respectively/29, 30/, while in the metal complexes peaks observed
between 3500-3400, 1610-1580, 1400-1500 cm1
were identified and attributed to above group frequencies.
A weak band observed at ca. 490-440 cm"1, in the spectra of the complexes was assigned to the v (M-N)
vibration/31/.
A broad band centered between 3500-3400 cm"1
in all the complexes arises due to v(OH) of the
coordinated H20. Besides, rocking (9r) and twisting (9t) H20 modes between 912-823 cm and around 679-
590 cm-, respectively, are observed in the complexes indicating coordinated water molecules/32/. Upon
heating, above 150 C, the colour of the complexes changed and the IR spectra showed disappearance of the
H20 vibrations.
v(S-O) in Na31-t2L at about 1020 cm" remains unaffected in the complexes, indicating that the-SO3
groups remain ionic even in complexes/33/.

Electronic spectra
Absorption spectral data of the aqueous solutions of the complexes are reported in Table-3. These appear
to be only charge transfer spectra with extinction coefficients, for the lowest band, around near 104
dm3mol
cm.The lowest energy absorption band (t2g --rt*) /34/ is bathochromic shifted in the complexes/35/
(Table 3). The more intense band at higher energy is believed to be the spin allowed singlet-singlet transition
while the weaker band at lower energy could be to the corresponding singlet-triplet transition mode
particularly, allowed by the strong spin-orbit coupling in the ion /36/. The other probabilities, like low
symmetry splitting of the metal orbitals and the presence of more than one entering ligand (each contributing
one rt* orbital), are excluded due to small extinction coefficient values/37/. Since the LMCT and MLCT
have covered the entire visible region, the d-d electronic transition bands submerged under the CT bands,
have not been identified.

Magnetic moments
The effective magnetic moments (ta) have been calculated from the room temperature magnetic
susceptibility measurements (Xg), assuming Curie Law behaviour of the complexes and using literature
values /38/ for diamagnetic corrections for the ions and also using directly measured corrections for the
ligand/39/. The magnetic moments of Mn(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Ni(II), and Cu(ll) complexes have been found
in the range as expected for Oh complexes (Table-l). The ta. value, 6.12 BM for Mn(II) complex lies well
within the range for high spin Oh complexes and 4.97 BM value for Fe(II) complex is diagnostic for d6
system with some antiferromagnetic exchange interaction/40/. The ta. values for Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) have
225
Vol. 3, Nos. 3-4, 2005 Synthesis, Characterization, Spectral Studies
andAntifungal Activity
been found to be 4.59, 2.9 and 1.9 BM respectively, suggesting that all these ions have octahedral
arrangements/41/(Figure 5).

ESR Spectra
ESR spectra of metal complexes give useful information regarding the stereochemistry and nature of
metal-ligand bonding /42/. Detailed ESR studies for metal-oxygen, metal-nitrogen and metal-sulphur
bonding behaviour in the ligands have also been reported/43/.
ESR spectra of Na6[Cu(HL)(HO)] complex have been recorded at room temperature and liquid
nitrogen temperature and the results are discussed below: Bonding parameters are included in Table 4 and the
spectrum is illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 which was analyzed by the method of Knenbuhl/44/, Sands/45/
and German et al./46/. Deviation of gll value from that of free electron spin value (2.0023) and closeness of
these values to those reported for distorted octahedral structure, suggest considerable distortion in the
geometry of the complex/47, 48/.
Four lines have been observed in the LNT spectra, which remain unresolved at room temperature
suggesting that a single copper ion is present in a molecule, or the complex .is a monomer. G values are
related by the expression, G gll- 2
and related to the exchange interaction between the copper centers, are
g+/- -2
greater than four, indicating negligible interaction between the two copper centers/49/.

Antifungal activity
Copper(II) sulphate and Na3HL tested individually as well as in mixture showed antifungal activity
against all the fungi tested (Tables 8, 9, 10), though copper sulphate was much better than the Na3H_L, where
spore germination of all the fungi was lower than Na3H2L at 259 ppm concentration. Copper sulphate did not
effect germination of Curvularia lunata significantly in its diluted form (Table 8) and similar results were
obtained in case of Na3H2L also (Table 9). Moreover, Na3H2L in its diluted from B (142 ppm) also did not
effect spore germination of Alternaria triticina significantly. In all the other concentrations of the two
compounds spore germination was affected significantly (Table 8, 9, 10). But the two compounds A (copper
sulphate) and B (ligand) in their mixture (1:2) form showed more efficacy in inhibiting spore germination of
Curvularia lunata and A. triticina at concentration 2(233 ppm) whereas at slightly higher concentration
A(259 ppm) and B(285 ppm) the effect of individual compounds was not significant. The effect of mixed
compounds and the individual compounds at the above concentrations showed almost similar results for the
rest of the fungi (Tables 8, 9, 10).
When M(II) and ligands were mixed in ratio of 1:2, an excellent synergistic effect was noticed in the case
of two of the tested fungi, viz., Curvularia lunata and Alternaria triticina. At concentration A (129 ppm)
and B(285 ppm), the effect of individual compounds was not significant against Curvularia lunata whereas
when the two compounds were mixed even at the lowest concentration 4(58 ppm), there was significant
reduction in spore germination. Similarly at B(142 ppm) spore germination of Alternaria triticina was not
significantly reduced. But the two compounds in mixture inhibited spore germination significantly even at
the lowest concentration 4(58 ppm). Similar results were obtained when 5 selected fungi were taken for their
mycelial growth on potato dextrose broth supplemented with the chemicals. The spores which showed
sensitivity against the chemicals also showed a similar trend in the production of mycelial dry weight. Out of
the 5 tested fungi, Alternaria triticina showed maximum sensitivity when the chemicals were mixed,
followed by Alternaria brassicae and Fusarium udurn (Table 11).
The result of the present experiment showed the probable synergistic effect of the two compounds in the
mixture. Such compounds may inhibit development of resistance since they have multisite action majority in
comparison to widely used fungicides with single site of action. Further experimentation with these
compounds in glasshouse and under field conditions is suggested for practical application of plant disease
control.
The effect of ligand Na3HzL was not very significant on the fungus Altarnaria solanae but it was very
effective in case of Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) complexes with Na3HzL where the inhibition (percent)

was 71, 87, 100 and 94, showing excellent synergetic effect (Table 12). In case of Collectrotrichun capscici,
Aspergillus niger and Fusarium udum the effects of ligand, Na3HzL, as well as Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II),
Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with Na3HzL, were very significant showing inhibition up-to 100 percent in
many of these cases.
From an overall study of the effect of the different metal salts, ligand Na3HzL, and its Mn(II), Fe(II),
Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) complexes, it is inferred that the metal complexes are better fungicidal
agents than their parent ligands. Again in certain cases the complexes (metal salts + ligands) are more
effective i.e., show more fungi-toxicity in comparison to the individual metal salts or the ligands, thereby
indicating a good synergistic effect or the effect of complexation in solution.
For practical utility of these compounds, the inhibiting capacity of the complexes was compared with
commercially available fungicides, e.g. dithane-M-45 (a broad fungicide) which is used in the inhibition of
spore germination in the 0.1 0.2% in the field condition limit for many fungi. It was found that in the case
of Na6[Ni(HL)2(HO)2] against Curvularia species, Colletotricum capsici, Alternaria brassicicola and
Alternaria solanae and Na6[Cu(HL)z(H20)2] against Curvularia species, Colletotricum capsici, Fusarium
udum, etc., the effect of the complexes was found to be better than that of commercially available fungicides
e. g. dithane M-45.
This observation is quite significant and opens up a new field of research where metal complexes of
organic molecules are better fungi-toxic than commercial products, showing greater possibility of
applicability of these complexes under field conditions. A detailed mechanistic study may be desirable in
future.
