ABSTRACT
Some new compounds of aluminium having the general formula AI[SC6HaN:C(R) CH2 C(O)R']3 where R
CH3, R'= CH (1); R CH3, Rt:
C6H5 (2); R- CV3, R'--
---CH-CH CH (3); R-- CF3, R' C6H
(4) have been synthesised by the reactions of Al(OPri)3 and the corresponding ligands in 1:3 molar ratios in
benzene. Elemental and spectroscopic (IR, H, 3C, and Z7AI NMR) characterisation of these monomeric
compounds reveals monofunctional bidentate behaviour of ligand moiety and the octahedral geometry around
aluminium atom. Compound (1), AI[SC6H4N:C(CH3)CHzCOCH3], has been tested for its antifertility activity
in male albino rats. The oral administration of this compound at the dose level 6.5 rag/rat/day reduced the
weights of testes and epididymides. Significant decrease in sperm motility as well as sperm density resulted
in the reduction of male fertility by 100%. Production of primary spermatocytes (preleptotene and
pachytene), secondary spermatocytes and step-19 spermatids declined by 56.10%, 44.42 %, 63.35 % and
64.57 % respectively. These results indicate that the administration of compound (1) in male rats brought
about an interference with spermatogenesis which ultimately caused infertility.
INTRODUCTION
Organic compounds containing-NC6H4S- unit are well known for their significant biological activities
/l/. Phenothiazines significantly affect the hypothalamous pituitary gonadal axis, thus resulting in a delay in
ovulation and menstruation in women/1/. In general biological activity of such type of compounds enhances
considerably on complexation with metal atom/2/. Some organo-antimony(IIl) and -bismuth(Ill) compounds
containing-NC6HaS- unit have been reported to show antifertility /3/ and antitumor /4/ activity, respectively.

Benzothiazolines constitute an important class of-NC6H4S-containing ligands. The metal derivatives of this
class of ligands have been extensively pursued to investigate the chelating properties of benzothiazolines.
Although mono- and bis- aluminium derivatives/5/of benzothiazolines derived from 13-diketones and 2-
aminothiophenol in which the ligands behave as bifunctional tridentate /5,6/ moiety have been reported, no
tris-aluminium derivatives of these ligands appear to have been synthesized so far. In view of the above, it
has been considered worthwhile to synthesize a new series of tris-aluminum derivatives of benzothiazolines,
and to investigate their physico-chemical and structural features as well as the antifertility activity of one of
the representative compounds in male albino rats.
EXPERIMENTAL
Moisture was carefully excluded throughout the experiments. Al(OPri)3 was prepared by literature method
/7/. Solvents (E. Merck) were dried by standard procedures/8/. Isopropanol in the azeotrope was estimated
oxidimetrically/9/, using 1N KzCr207 solution in 12.5 % H2SO4. Aluminium was estimated gravimetrically
as oxinate/9/. Nitrogen and sulphur w.ere determined by Kjeldahl and Messenger methods/9/respectively. 2-
Aminothiophenol and [3-diketones were distilled prior to use. The benzothiazolines /10/ RC(NH
C6H4S)CH2C(O)R' [where R CH3, R'= CH3(LIH); R CH, R'= C6Hs(L:ZH), R CF3, R' 2-C4H.S
(L3H); R CF3, and R' C6Hs(L4H)] have been prepared by the equimolar condensation reactions of 2-
aminothiophenol and substituted 13-diketones in refluxing benzene. Liberated water was removed
azeotropically with benzene. IR spectra of the ligands and their complexes have been recorded on a Nicolet
DX FT IR Spectrophotometer using CsI cell. IH, 3C and -7A1 NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL-FX-
90Q (90 MHz) or Bruker DPX 300 MHz Spectrometer either in CDCI3 or C6H6 solution. Molecular weights
ofthese compounds were determined on a Knauer Vapour Pressure Osmometer in benzene solution.
Since all the complexes have been synthesised by the same method, for the sake of brevity, synthesis of
one representative compound is given in detail. Synthetic and analytical results of the other compounds are
summarised in Table I.
SYNTHESIS OF COMPOUND (1)
About 25 ml benzene solution ofAl(OPri)3 (0.56 g, 2.74 mM) was added to the benzene solution (-20 ml)
of the ligand [CH3C(NHC6H4S)CHzCOCH3] (1.71 g, 8.25 mM) and the solution was refluxed on a
fractionating column for-4 h. The isopropanol formed in the reaction was fractionated out azeotropically
with benzene. Progress as well as the completion of the reaction was checked by the estimation of the
isopropanol in the azeotrope by the oxidimetric method/9/. After the completion of the reaction, the excess
of the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. For the purification, this compound was dissolved in a
small amount of benzene 15 ml and then the petroleum ether (40-60 C) was added slowly until a viscous
compound began to separate. The solution was kept overnight at about-10 C. The viscous compound, left
after decanting offthe solvent, was dried under reduced pressure. Yield, 87% (1.54 g).

Biological tests
Male albino rats of Wistar strain weighing 150-180 g obtained from Jamia Hamdard, Hamdard
University, New Delhi, were used. Animals were kept in plastic cages with proper aeration and temperature,
feeding on a standard rat pellet diet (Hindustan Lever Limited) and water ad libitum,
After 55 days of drug administration the mating exposure test was performed in control as well as in
treated groups. Rats of both groups were cohabitated with normal adult proestrous females for fertility test in
the ratio of 2. Successful mating was confirmed the following morning by presence of sperms in the
vaginal smear. The inseminated females were separated and number of litters delivered were recorded/11/.
Proven fertile male rats were taken and divided into two groups of 10 rats each Group Rats received 0.5
ml olive oil for 60 days, Group II--> Rats treated with compound (1) dispersed in 0.5 ml olive oil, 6.5
mg/rat/day for 60 days.
On day 61 st
animals of both groups were sacrificed using ether anesthesia and their reproductive organs
i.e. testes, epididymis, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate were dissected out. Half ofthe tissues were kept at
-20 C until assayed for biochemical estimations of protein/12/, sialic acid/13/, glycogen/14/, cholesterol
/15/, and fructose/16/. The remaining half of the tissues were fixed in Bouin's fluid. Paraffin sections were
made and stained with haematoxyline and eosin. The motility of cauda epididymai spermatozoa was
recorded. Sperm density was assessed in testis and cauda epididymis by the method of Prasad /17/. Cell
population dynamics, i.e. germinal cell counts, was based on the calculation made for each cell type per cross
tubular sections. Various cell components were quantitatively analysed. Mean and standard error of mean
(SEM) were calculated and the significance ofdifference was analysed by applying student's t-test.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Reactions of Al(OPri)3 with benzothiazolines [RC(NHC6H4S)CH2C(O)R'] in 3 molar ratios in
refluxing benzene proceed with the rearrangement of benzothiazoline ring and result in Schiff base
derivatives of aluminium.

All the above derivatives are either coloured viscous liquids or solids and highly soluble in organic
solvents like benzene, chloroform etc. These derivatives are found to be monomeric in benzene solution.
Spectroscopic studies
Infraredspectra
The absence of vSH mode (-2540 cm1) and the presence of vNH mode in the range 3230-3340 cm1
in
the spectra of free ligands indicate the presence of benzothiazoline ring in the ligands. A comparative study
of the spectra of complexes with corresponding ligands shows the disappearance of-NH band and the
appearance of several new bands for vC--N, vAI+--N [18] and vAI-S [5] in the region of 1618-1645 cm-,
482-502 cm and 362-439 cm, respectively. This may be interpreted in terms of rearrangement of
benzothiazoline ring during the formation of a Schiff base derivatives of aluminium. The spectra of the
ligands as well as complexes show a band in the region 1681-1707 cm due to >C=O group. The absence of
any shift in the position of this band indicates that the >C=O group does not participate in bonding during
complexation.
H NMR Spectra
A comparative study of the H NMR spectra of aluminum derivatives (Table-ll) recorded using TMS as
reference with the corresponding ligands shows the disappearance of the-NH signal (observed at 6 4.53
6.46 ppm in the spectra of ligands). This supports the rearrangement of benzothiazoline ring of the ligand
during the formation of Schiff base aluminium complexes. Various R, R' and methylene protons are observed
at their expected positions with a small shift as compared to their positions in the corresponding ligands. A
multiplet in the range 6 6.83 8.48 ppm may be assigned to the aromatic protons of Schiffbases.
Z'
C NMR Spectra
3C NMR spectra of aluminium derivatives (1-4) show C=N carbon signal in the region i 166.82- 167.94
ppm. This signal was observed at 5 161.39-165.74 ppm in the spectra of ligands and assigned to >C-N of
benzothiozoline ring. A down field shift of-2.0-5.0 ppm in its position reveals that this group is rearranged
to >C-N on complexation and the nitrogen atom coordinates to central aluminium atom. The signals for R, R'
218
S. Sharma et al. Bioinorganic Chemistty andApplications
and CH2 carbons in complexes show a small shift in comparision to their position in the free ligands. A signal
for >C=O group carbon has been observed in the region 5 183.04- 190.09 ppm. No appreciable shift has been
observed in the position of this signal on complexation. No shifting in the position of >C-O carbon signal
indicates the non involvement of >C=O group in bonding. The aromatic carbon signals have been observed
in the range i 122.25 153.98 ppm (Table-Ill). The Ca carbon of the-NC6H4S- group shows a down field
shift on complexation which further indicates the formation of an AI-S bond.

27A1NMR Spectra
)-7Al NMR spectra of these complexes (1-4) (Table-II) show the presence of a sharp signal in the region 6
1.41 -2.35 ppm as singlet. The appearance ofZVAl NMR signal in this region confirm the existence ot'hexa-
coordination/18/around the central aluminium atom in all the four complexes.
In view of the monomeric nature of these complexes, the bonding of both the nitrogen and sulphur atoms
of all the four ligand moieties with central aluminium atom as well as hexa-coordination as revealed by 27A1
NMR, the following structure (Fig I) may be proposed for these aluminium derivatives.
Fig. 1" Proposed structure for I[SC6H41 "C(R)CH2C(O)R']3 derivatives
where R CH3, R' CH3 (1); R CH3, C6H5 (2); R CF3,
R'= -=CH-CH=CH (3); R CF, R'= C6H.s (4).
It is clear from the spectral data that these ligands behave as monofunctional bidentate moiety in these
derivatives. These results are in contrast to the earlier reports in which these ligands are reported to behave as
bifunctional tridentate /5,6/. The monofunctional nature of the ligands in these aluminium complexes is
confirmed as there is no evidence of any enolisation in these ligands and their bidentate behaviour may be
easily established on the bases of maximum coordination number of aluminium, which is six, and the
monofunctional nature of the ligands indicates that the enolisation of these ligands does not take place during
the complexation, which is also clear from the spectroscopic evidences.
Antifertility activity of compound AI[SC6H4N:C(CHa)CH2COCH3]3 (1)
The body weight of rats after administration of compound (I) did not alter significantly; however the
weights of testes (P < 0.001), epididymis (P < 0.001), seminal vesicle (P < 0.01) and ventral prostate (P <
0.001) were reduced significantly (Table IV). The motility of the cauda epididymal sperm as well as
concentration of sperm in testes and cauda epididymis was reduced significantly (P < 0.001). The fertility of
220
S. Sharma et al. Bioino12anic Chem&tly andApplications
compound (1) treated rats declined up to 100 % (Table V). Most of the cell types of seminiferous tubule
showed significant reduction. The population of primary spermatocytes (preleptotene and pachytene),
secondary spermatocytes and step-19 spermatids declined by 56.10 %, 44.42 %, 63.35 % and 64.54 %
respectively (Table VI).

The significant reduction in testes weight after the treatment with compound (I) can be attributed to the
loss of germ cell/20/. It has been observed that the size of testes bears a direct relationship to the number of
sperms produced/21/. The marked reduction in sperm count in our experiment also suggests a disturbed
testicular and epididymal microenvironment. The treatment with compound (1) exerted a strong inhibitory
effect on epididymis, seminal vesicle and ventral prostate. The decrease in weight of accessory sex organs
indicates the atrophy of glandular tissue and reduction in secretory ability, thus reflecting the decreased level
of testosterone/22/. It has been reported earlier that there is a high correlation of reproductive capacity with
the mass of accessory sex organs/23/. Decreased seminiferous tubular diameter reflects tubular shrinkage
which may occur due to cell death or sloughing of epithelial cells/24/. Sperm motility and density directly
correlate with fertility and any change in them may cause infertility/25/. It is also evident that testicular
function would be altered by reduced protein content/26/. Reduction of the protein content of the testes is
due to loss of germ cell as well as the depletion of membrane protein content/27/.

The structural integrity of acrosomal membrane is dependent upon sialic acid and due to alteration in its
content, the motility and fertilizing ability of sperms may also be effected /28, 29/. The significant decrease
in glycogen content after the treatment with compound (1) possibly could be due to inhibition of glycolysis
during spermatogenesis as has been observed by Bone et al. /30/ in ornidazole treated rats. Glycolytic
metabolism of spermatozoa is also hampered by reducing level of fructose resulting in abnormal sperm
function which may ultimately lead to complete male sterility/31/.
