ABSTRACT
The reactions of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride with Schiff bases derived by condensing 2-
amirio-5-phenyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole with benzaldehyde (SPT), 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (SNT), 4-
methoxybenzaldehyde (SMT), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (SSTH) or 2-hydroxyacetophenone (SATH) have
been studied in refluxing tetrahydrofuran and complexes of types [Cp2TiCI(SB)]C1 (SB= SPT, SNT or SMT)
and [Cp2Ti(SB')]CI (SB'H SSTH or SATH) have been isolated. Tentative structural conclusions are drawn
for these reaction products based upon elemental analyses, electrical conductance, magnetic moment and
spectral (UV-vis, IR and IH NMR) data. Studies were conducted to assess the growth-inhibiting potential of
the complexes synthesized, and the ligands, against various fungal and bacterial strains.
INTRODUCTION
One aspect of the use of coordination compounds of transition metals is their application as biologically
active substances/1/. The attention of investigators has focused increasingly on bio-coordination compounds,
which can be used as biologically active preparations in medicine and agriculture. The complexes prepared
for use in agriculture are, as a rule, more effective at lower concentrations than the metal ions and organic
molecules, which enter into their composition. The anticancer and antiviral activities of metal complexes
have also been studied. It has also been observed that a small structural change in the ligand may lead to the
enhanced activity of the metal complexes. Among the various classes of biologically active coordination
compounds, complexes with thiadiazoles as ligands have attracted attention.
Thiadiazole ring is reported/2-5/to display fungicidal property by virtue of-N=C-S-linkage, which is a
possible toxophore in many pesticides. 2,5-Disbstituted 1,3,4-thiadiazole moieties have been found to
possess herbicidal, radioprotective, diuretic and bacteriostatic properties. Acetamide derivatives of 2-
(benzoyl aminomethyl)-l,3,4-thiadiazole have been found to possess antiarrhythmic, antimetastatic,

psychoneurosis, schistosomicidal, fungicidal, herbicidal and pesticidal activities. There are a few reports on
transition metal complexes of Schiff bases derived from 2-amino-5-aryl-l,3,4-thiadiazoles. Some transition
metal complexes of copper(II), nickel(II), iron(II), cobalt(II), zinc(II), cadmium(II) and silver(I) with 2-
amino-5-phenyl-l,3,4- thiadiazole have been prepared and characterized /6,7/. Bismuth(III) and
antimony(Ill) complexes with 2-amino-5-methyl-l,3,4 thiadiazole /8/, the cobalt (II) nickel(II) and
copper(II) complexes of 2-amino-5-methyl arid 2,5-dimethyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole and ruthenium, rhodium,
iridium complexes of 5-amino-l,3,4- thiadiazole-2-thiol have also been reported /9/. The synthesis,
characterization and biological activity of cobalt(II), nickel(II) copper(II) and zinc(II) complexes with
mercapto thiadiazoles have been reported by Mishra et al. /10/. Nath et al. reported /11/ the synthes.is,
spectral, thermal and biological studies of adducts of organotin(IV) halides with Schiff bases derived from 2-
amino-5-(o-methoxyphenyl)-l,3,4-thiadiazoles. Thus, in view of the versatile chelating ability of
thiadiazoles, it has been considered of interest to study the reactions of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)
dichloride with substituted thiadiazoles. The structures of the ligands are shown below ( ).

EXPERIMENTAL
All the reactions were carried out under strictly anhydrous conditions. Tetrahydrofuran (Merck) was dried
by sodium wire overnight and then refluxed until it gave a blue colour with benzophenone. The ligands,
Schiff bases, were prepared as mentioned in the literature/11/. Bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride
was prepared /12/ by heating CpNa with TIC14 in a N2 atmosphere. Elemental analyses and physical
measurements were made as noted earlier/13/.
Synthesis of Complexes
(a) Reaction of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) chloride with Schiff base derived from 2-amino-5-
phenyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole and benzaldehyde (SPT) (molar ratio 1:1)
Schiff base (SPT) (0.02 mol) was added to a refluxing solution of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)
dichloride (0.02 mol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (40 cm3). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 60 hrs.
The brown coloured complex so obtained was filtered, washed with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and dried in
vacuo. The complex was identified to be [(CsI-15)2TiCI(CsH1N3S)]C1. Yield 58%

solution was reduced to about 10 cm3. Dry petroleum ether (b.p. 60-80,20 cm) was added to it and the
solution was allowed to stand for one hour, which resulted in yellow crystals of the product. The complex,
thus obtained, was filtered and dried in oven at 80C. The complex was found to be [(CsHs)-

The same procedure was adopted for the synthesis of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives with
Schiff bases derived from 2-amino-5-phenyl-l,3,4-thiadiazole and o-hydroxy acetophenone (SATH). For
the sake of brevity, such reactions are summarized in Table 1. The analytical data of the products are given in
Table 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A systematic study of the reactions of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride with neutral (SB) and
monobasic (SB'H) Schiff bases in (1:1) molar ratio have been carried out. The reactions can be represented
by the following equations.
CP2TiC12 +SB efluxTHF [CP2TiCLSB]C
CP2TiC12 + SB'H CH2Cl2reflux > [CP2TiCI'SB']C1
where SB= SPT, SNT or SMT; SB1H= SSTH and SATH.
The elemental analyses (Table 1) indicate a 1:1 metal to ligand stoichiometry for all these complexes. The
compounds are yellow to dark brown in colour, non-volatile and moisture sensitive. The solid products
obtained are thermally stable but decompose on heating. The complexes of the type [(CsHs)2TiCI(SB)]C1 are
soluble in dimethylformamide and dimethyl- suplhoxide, while the complexes of the type [(CsH)zTi(SB')]C1
are sparingly soluble in hot methanol, ethanol and soluble in dimethylformamide and dimethylsulphoxide.
Electrical conductance measurements of the complexes in dimethylformamide indicate their 1:1 electrolytic
nature. Magnetic susceptibility values of these complexes at room temperature show their diamagnetic
behavior.
Electronic spectra
The electronic spectra of all Schiff base derivatives in nujol show bands in the regions 23,500--24,200,
30,000 and 34,800 cm-. The first band may be assigned /14/ to the charge-transfer band and its in
accordance with their (n-1)dns electronic configuration. The second and third bands (also appear in
ligands) are assigned to w-* transitions of the azomethine linkages.
Infrared spectra
The significant infrared spectral bands of the complexes are given in Table 2. A comparison of the
characteristic infrared absorption bands of Schiff bases with those of the corresponding titanium(IV)
derivatives reveals the following important features.
(a) The infrared spectra of the ligands show bands at ca. 1650-1635 and 1580-1565 cm-l
which may be
assigned/2/to be v(C=N) (azomethine group) and v(C=N) (ring), respectively. The first band is shifted
292
A.K. Srivastava et al. Bioinorganic Chemistry andApplications
towards the lower frequency region (20-30 cm-) in the titanium(IV) complexes indicating the
coordination of the azomethine nitrogen atom of the Schiff bases. However, the second band vC=N (ring)
is found to split into two; one almost located at the original position indicating non-coordinated vC=N,
and the other shifted to lower frequency at 1550-1540 cm-,arising due to coordinated vC=N mode. The
splitting of the vC=N (ring) absorption band suggests that only one of the ring nitrogen is involved in
coordination and other is free and non-coordinated. This is further supported by a new band at ca. 450-
440 cm
-assignable/15/to v(Ti-N) in the complexes.
(b) The v(C-S) band in the ligands occurs/16/at ca. 650 cm-1, which remains unaltered in the spectra of the
complexes indicating the non-coordination of sulphur atom ofthe thiadiazole ring.
(c) The infrared spectra of the ligands containing-OH group (SSTH, SATH) show strong band at ca. 3400
cm
-due to v(O-H). However, this band disappears in the spectra of their corresponding complexes
indicating the coordination of phenolic oxygen to metal. The v(Ti-O) band appears at -,-500-480 cm-I.
(d) Absorption bands occurring at ,,,3000 cm-1
for v(C-H), -,,1430 cm
-for v(C-C), 1020 and 810 cm-1
for
6(C-H) in the complexes indicate the presence of the cyclopentadienyl ring. All these bands are similar to
those reported/17/for bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV).

H NMR spectra
The different proton magnetic resonance signals (recorded in DMSO-d6) are given in Table 3. The
intensities of all the resonance lines were determined by planimetric integration. Comparing the spectra of
ligands and their corresponding complexes, one can derive the following conclusions.
(a) A signal in all Schiff base derivatives at 5 6.5-6.8 may be assigned to the protons of the
cyclopentadienyl ring. The appearance of a single, sharp cyclopentadienyl resonance is attributed/18/to
the rapid rotation of the cyclopentadienyl ring around the metal ring axis.
(b) All the ligands show signal at 5 7.1-7.5 integrating for aromatic group protons. This signal shows slight
shift upon co-ordination.
(c) The signal observed at 5 9.4-9.8 in the spectra of ligands, derived from salicylaldehyde and o-
hydroxyacetophene may be assigned to the phenolic protons. This signal disappears in the spectra of their
corresponding complexes indicating the coordination through deprotonation of phenolic oxygen atoms.
(d) The proton signal due to the CH=N group appears at 5 8.3 in the ligands. In the complexes, this signal
shifts downfield which is probably due to the donation of the lone pair of electrons by the azomethine
nitrogen to the titanium atom.

[(CsH.s)2Ti(SAT)]CI 6.65(s) 7.25 7.58(m) 2.10(s)
Thus, it is obvious from the above discussion that the Schiff bases (SPT, SNT, SMT) act as neutral,
bidentate ligands coordinating through azomethine nitrogen and one of the nitrogen of the thiadiazole ring,
whereas the Schiff bases SSTH, SATH act as monobasic, tridentate chelating agents coordinating through

azomethine nitrogen, one of the nitrogens of the thiadiazole ring and deprotonated phenolic oxygen atom.
Therefore, on the basis of above spectral features the following structures may be proposed for
[Cp_TiC1.SB]C1 (II) and [Cp2Ti.SB']C1 (In) complexes.

The fungicidal activity of the ligands and the complexes were evaluated in DMF against Aspergillus
niger, Aspergillus alternata and Helminthosporiutn oryzae by the agar plate technique/19/at 1000, 100 and
10 ppm concentrations with triplicate determinations in each case. The average percentage inhibition was
calculated using the expression: inhibition (%)= 100 (C-T)/C, where C and T are the diameters of the fungus

colony in control and test plates, respectively. The recorded results (Table 4) lead to the following
conclusions:
(a) The compounds show significant toxicity at 1000 ppm conc. Against all species of fungi. However, the
complexes are more active than ligands, which may be owing to the chelation and the presence of sulphur
atom.
(b) The activity decreases on dilution.
(e) The best activity was noted for complex with ligand derived from 4-methoxybenzaldehyde. This indicates
that the presence of methoxy group imparts the fungicidal power in these series of compounds.
(d) The ligands and complexes are more active againstA. niger thanA. alternata and H. oryzae.
The variation in the effectiveness of different biocidal agents against different organisms, as suggested by
Lawrence et al. /20/ depends either on the impermeability of the cells or differences in ribosomes of
antimicrobial agent.
Antibacterial activity
The antibacterial activity of the complexes together with parent ligands has been screened against Gram-
positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli by the paper disk plate method/21/at 1000
ppm conc. The inhibition zone (mm) around each disk was measured after 24 h and the results of these
studies are listed in Table 5. It is clear from the screening data that complexes are_slightly more toxic than the
parent ligands.
