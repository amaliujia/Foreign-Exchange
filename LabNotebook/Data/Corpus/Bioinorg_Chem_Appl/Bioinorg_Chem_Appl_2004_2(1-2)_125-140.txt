ABSTRACT
The interactions of Zn(ll) ions with the blocked hexapeptide models -TESHHK-, -TASHHK- and
-TEAHHK- of the -ESHH- motif of the C-terminal of historic H2A were studied by using potentiometric and
IH-NMR techniques. The first step of these studies was to compare the pKa values of the two His residues
inside each hexapeptide calculated by potentiometric or H-NMR titrations. Hereafter, the potentiometric
titrations in the pH range 5 11 suggest the formation of several monomeric Zn(ll) complexes. It was found
that all hexapeptides bind to Zn(ll) ions initially through both imidazole nitrogens in weakly acidic and
neutral solutions forming slightly distorted octahedral complexes. At higher pH values, the combination of
potentiometric titrations and one and two dimensional NMR suggested no amide coordination in the
coordination sphere of Zn(II) ions. Obviously, these studies support that the -ESHH- sequence of histone
H2A is a potential binding site for Zn(II) ions similarly with the Cu(II) and Ni(ll) ions, presented in previous
papers.
INTRODUCTION
It is well known that several metals have been found to be carcinogenic to humans and animals/1,2/.
Nevertheless the molecular mechanism by which metal carcinogenicity is exerted is not fully understood.
Studies of several years support that neoplastic transformation of cells results from a heritable alteration in
the genetic code, concluding that any molecule that can bind with constituents of the cell nuclei may affect
the genetic code. Thus, it is believed that metal ions may cause changes to the genetic code by their binding
to the proteins and DNA. Especially, the abundance of histones makes them the prime expectants for that
role. It must be noticed that the nucleosomes represent the first level of DNA compaction in eukaryotic nuclei
and consist of 146 bp of core DNA wrapped around a cluster of eight histone proteins (containing two copies
of each ofhistones H2A, H2B, H3 andH4), with 20-60 bp of linker DNA joining adjacent cores/3/.
Obviously, the studies of metal interactions with the peptides or protein fragments, especially histones,
can lead in explaining mechanisms related to cancer and toxicity caused by metals. As a consequence, the
coordination properties of Ni(II) ions towards the tetrapeptide Ac-CysAlalleHis-am (-CAIH-) representing

the 110-113 residues of histone H3/4-6/and the peptide model Ac-AlaLysArgHisArgLys-am (-AKRHRK-)
of the N-terminal "tail" of historic H4 and its modifications has been reported/7,8/. In the case of the peptide
model of histone H3, it was established that Ni(II) ions form a very strong complex, that could mediate
oxidative damage to DNA/4-6/. In addition, it was found that at pH above 7, Ni(ll) complexation with the
hexapeptide Ac-ThrGluSerHisHisLys-am (-TESHHK-) and bigger peptide models containing the C-terminal
"tail" -ESHH-, which corresponds to the 121-124 residues of a major variant of mammalian histone H2A,
was accompanied by hydrolytic cleavage of the -Glu-Ser- peptide bond and the formation of a square-planar
Ni(II) complex with the resulting -SHHK- sequence/9,10/. It must be noticed that Cu(ll) ions provide similar
hydrolytic activity with kinetics more than three times slower than those for Ni(II)/10/.
Furthermore, we studied the interactions of Cu(II) ions with the same H2A histone hexapeptide model
TESHHK-/1 l/and compared the results to those.of Ni(ll) ions/9/. The Cu(II)-TESHHK- complex which
was formed at about pH 7.4 was able to induce oxidative damage of 2'-deoxyguanosine (dG), in the presence
of hydrogen peroxide /11/. Later, a systematic study of interactions of Ni(II) and Cu(ll) ions with the
hexapeptides Ac-YhrAlaSerHisHisLys-am (-TASHHK-), Ac-ThrGluAlaHisHisLys-am (-TEAHHK-), Ac-
YhrGluSerA[aHisLys-am (-TESAHK-).and Ac-ThrGluSerHisAlaLys-am (-TESHAK-), peptide models of
the -ESHH- motif of histone H2A, led us to conclude that these sequences are potential binding sites for
Ni(ll)-and Cu(ll) ions and additionally the presence of Ser and His-5 residues inside the peptide sequence
may be critical for the hydrolysis reaction caused by Ni(ll) or Cu(ll) ions/11-14/.
Bearing in mind that except Ni(ll) and Cu(ll) ions/15,16/, His residues are the major coordination sites in
the active centers of several Zn(II)-containing enzymes /17-19/, in this paper we decided to study the
interactions of the blocked hexapeptides-TESHHK-,-TASHHK- and -TEAHHK-, peptide models of the
-ESHH- motif of histone H2A, with Zn(ll) ions. We chose only the hexapeptides containing two His residues
from the five hexapeptides ve have studied previously/! 1-14/, because in most of the active centers of
Zn(!l)-containing enzymes, Zn(ll) ions are bound in more than one His residue/!7-19/. The next step of this
work will be the study of the possibility of Zn(ll) ions to cleave the -ESHH- motif of histone H2A, similarly
with Ni(ll) and Cu(ll) ions/11-14/.

Peptide synthesis
The blocked hexapeptides -TESHHK-,-TASHHK- and-TEAHHK- were synthesized in the solid phase,
as described previously/12,13/. ESI-MS and IH-NMR techniques were used for the characterization of the
peptides 12,13/.
Potentiometry
The protonation and stability constants of Zn(ll) complexes of-TESHHK-,-TASHHK- and -TEAHHK-,
in the presence of 0.1 M KNO3, were determined by using pH-metric titrations over the pH range 2.5 11, at
25 C, with 0.1 M NaOH as titrant (Molspin automatic titrator, Molspin Ltd., Newcastle-upon-Tyne, U.K.).
Changes of pH were monitored with a combined glass-silver chloride electrode calibrated daily in H+
concentrations by HNO3 titrations/20/. The time to reach pH-equilibrium during titrations varied from 1-10
min, depending on the pH value. Sample volumes of 1.5 mL and concentrations of mM of the hexapeptides
and 0.5 mM Zn(NO3)2"4H20 were used. The experimental data were analyzed using the SUPERQUAD
program/21/. Standard deviations computed by SUPERQUAD refer to random errors.
NMR spectroscopy
H-NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX 400MHz spectrometer. The one dimensional
experiments were carried out in 1:4 D20:HO mixtures at a peptide concentration of 5 mM of both free and
Zn(ll)-bound hexapeptide -TASHHK-, in peptide Zn(ll) ratio 1.2:1 at pH* 10.5 and 25 C (The pH* reading
of the electrode was not corrected for the isotope effect). TOCSY experiments was used to assign the spectra
of both free and Zn(ll)-bound hexapeptide -TASHHK-, in peptide Zn(ll) ratio 1.2:1 (cL-- 15 mM) in the
same pH* and temperature. Finally, H-NMR titrations were carried out for the hexapeptides -TESHHK-,-
TASHHK- and -TEAHHK- (c 5 mM) in 99.9 % D20 solutions covering the pH* range 2 11 at 25 C, used
to calculate the pKa values ofN3 nitrogen atoms of imidazole rings ofthe two His residues.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Acid-base behavior of free hexapeptides
Both the N- and C-terminal of the hexapeptides models (Scheme 1) were blocked by acetylation and
amidation, respectively, to make the peptides more realistic models of the -ESHH- motif of histone H2A. As
has already been written in the Experimental Section, ESI-MS and H-NMR techniques were used for the
characterization ofthe hexapeptides but the data have been already reported in previous papers/12,13/.
The first two hexapeptides -TESHHK-, -TEAHHK- and the hexapeptide -TASHHK- contain four and
three groups, respectively, which are capable of reversible proton binding. These groups are the carboxyl
group of Glu residue, the N3 imidazole nitrogens of His residues and the e-amino group of Lys residue. The
protonation constants and dissociation macroconstants of these groups were measured by potentiometric

titrations and are presented in Table I. The highest pKa values between 10.48 10.28 can be easily assigned
to the e-amino group of Lys residues and the lowest values at 3.85 and 4.10 of-TESHHK- and -TEAHHK-,
respectively, can be assigned to the carboxyl group ofGlu residues, according to the literature data/9,22,23/.

The other values of macroconstants corresponding to the deprotonations of His residues were found to be
separated by less than one log unit, suggesting a possibility of concurrent deprotonations at the two His
residues. The comparison with the literature indicates that the lowest pKa value should mainly correspond to
128

the protonation of the His residue closer to the N-termini of the peptide, while the closest His in the C-
terminal has a higher basicity/24-26/.

Obviously, the two His residues in these hexapeptides have multiple acid-base equilibria, it is known that
potentiometric titrations cannot always resolve these overlapping proton dissociations. On the contrary, NMR
spectroscopy investigates individual protons in peptides or proteins, facilitating the study of specific proton
association-dissociation equilibrium in polyprotic systems. Thus, a series of one dimensional H-NMR

spectra of all hexapeptides at various pH* values were recorded for the further verification of the pKa values
of the two His residues, calculated from the potentiometric data. Generally, it is known that the proton
dissociation can be easily monitored from the chemical shifts of the neighboring protons at each pH* value.
In particular, the dissociation of the N3 imidazole nitrogen atoms can be calculated from the plot of chemical
shifts ofthe adjacent protons ofC2 and C5 carbon atoms of imidazole rings as a function of pH*.
It must be mentioned that the calculation of these pK, values was realized using two different methods, in
the first one, the pK, values of the two His residues were calculated independently/27,28/. In contrast, in the
second method the two pK, values calculated together/29/.
In Figure 2 an example plot produced from the chemical shifts of the imidazole protons of C2 of
hexapeptide -TASHHK- is presented. Similar plots were produced for all hexapeptides.

atoms of both His residues, in the case of the hexapeptide -TASHHK-. Rabenstein-Sayer method
was used for the fitting ofthe data.
Obviously, the pKa values oftwo His residues of all hexapeptides calculated using the first method are not
equivalent with the comparable values calculated from the potentiometric titrations (Table 2). Thereby, the
pK, values of two neighboring groups as it is occurred in the case of the hexapeptides -TESHHK-,
-TASHHK- and -TEAHHK- cannot be extracted with rewarding accuracy using the first method. In contrast,
the same pK, values calculated using the second method are similar with the comparable values calculated
from the potentiometric titrations (Table 2). Additionally, the use of the second method led to more realistic
and accurate values because for the calculations we took into account the presence of both His residues.

Zinc Complexation
Potentiometric titrations in aqueous solutions were carried out for the hexapeptides in the presence of zinc
nitrate in peptide Zn(ll) ratios 1:1 and 2:1. The stability constants of Zn(ll) complexes, calculated from
these titrations using the SUPERQUAD program are presented in Table 3. The species distribution diagrams
presented in Figure 3 indicate the formation of four complexes (ZnHL, ZnL, ZnH_L and ZnH_2L) in the case
of Zn(II) /-TESHHK- and Zn(il) /-TEAHHK- systems and two complexes (ZnHL and ZnH.zL) in the case
of Zn(II) /-TASHHK- system. Binuclear complexes of type ZnzLx or complexes with two ligands were
repeatedly rejected by SUPERQUAD program/21/and were eliminated from the model.

As can be seen from Figure 3, the coordination of all hexapeptides starts in pH above 5 and the ZnHL
complexes are formed. The higher values of their stability constants (Table 3) comparing with the analogues
complexes with GlyHis/30/, AlaHis /31/, GlyHist/32L SarHist /32/ and with protected peptides -HisHis-/33/
and -HisProHis- /34/ support the coordination of all hexapeptides through both imidazole rings. It must be
mentioned that for the ZnHL complexes with the above dipeptides and the protected peptides the imidazole
or amino monodentate binding/30-34/have been suggested. Additionally, the carboxylate oxygen of Giu
residue of-TESHHK- and -TEAHHK-, which is deprotonated in the pH range of the formation of these

octahedral complexes similarly with the analogues Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes with the same hexapeptides

Increasing the pH, the complexes ZnL and ZnH_L with hexapeptides -TESHHK- and -TEAHHK- release
additional protons with pKa 7.53 and 7.11 (ZnL), 7.97 and 8.66 (ZnH_L), respectively (Table 3). Although
these pKa values are comparable with the pKa values belonging to His-containing unprotected peptides with
the amide coordination and could be abstracted from amide nitrogens/30,31,36-38/, we do not support the
amide coordination of both hexapeptides. Generally, it is known that amide deprotonations is more difficult
to observe with Zn(ll) ions than other metal ions, including Cu(ll) and Ni(ll) ions/16/. At high pH values it
is possible to observe this type of coordination but additionally competition from hydroxo complex formation
is limitative. Thus, Zn(II) ions exhibit a stronger tendency to undergo hydrolysis than amide coordination.
Concluding, the most probable hypothesis about the two deprotonations leading to the formation of ZnHL
--ZnL --, ZnH_L complexes may be the successive deprotonation of already bound water molecules. This is in
agreement with the preliminary analysis of the titration data which indicated titration of two more protons in
the case ofthe hexapeptide Zn(II) systems than in the case ofthe free hexapeptides.
As can be seen in Table 3, the stability constants of ZnL complexes with the hexapeptides -TESHHK-
and -TEAHHK- are higher than that of ZnL complexes with the protected dipeptide -HisHis- (log fl 4.19)
/33/and with the cyclic dipeptide c-HisHis (log fl 2.55)/35/, in which the coordination of both imidazole
rings to the metal ions were proposed. Obviously, ZnL complexes with the studied hexapeptides are
considerably more stable than the corresponding complexes of the above reported and other His-containing
peptides which are coordinated through one or two nitrogen atoms (Table 3). The higher stability of the
studied complexes may contribute from the carboxyl group of Glu residue which remained bound to the
metal ions. It is worthy to note that the absence of Ser residue stabilize the ZnL complex with -TEAHHK-
comparing with the corresponding complex with -TESHHK- (Table 3).
In contrast, the stability constants of ZnH.L complexes with the hexapeptides -TESHHK- and
-TEAHHK- are similar to the related complexes with GlyHis/30/, AlaHis/3 l/, GlyHisLys/34/, GlyHisGly
/35/and HmSHis /38/ which all correspond to the {NH2, N, Nm} donor set involved in the equatorial plane
of Zn(II) ions (Table 3). Although amide coordination in ZnH.L complexes with the hexapeptides
TESHHK- and -TEAHHK- is not suggested, the participation of the carboxyl group of Glu residue and the
two imidazole rings in coordination sphere ofZn(II) ions may result in similar stabilization with the {NH,,, N
N,,,} mode.
Finally, above pH 8 the deprotonation of the ZnH.L complexes with the hexapeptides -TESHHK- and-
TEAHHK- takes place with a pKa 10.30 and 10.34, respectively, forming the ZnHozL complexes (Table 3).
These pKa values are in good agreement to that for protonation of e-amino group of Lys residue, pK 10.28
and 10.25 (Table 1), in free ligands -TESHHK- and -TEAHHK-, respectively. Obviously, the ZnH.2L
complexes provide a similar coordination mode with ZnH.L complexes, differing to the deprotonated and
uncoordinated e-amino group of Lys residue similarly with the analogues Cu(ll) and Ni(II) complexes with
the studied hexapeptides/11-13/.
Fitting of the titration data of the Zn(II) -TASHHK- system can be done only considering the ZnHL and
ZnH.2L species. This may be due to simultaneous deprotonation of the coordinated water protons and the
protonated e-amino group of Lys.
The proposed structures of some selected species are presented in Figure 4.

In order to study further the proposed structures we decided to use NMR spectroscopy. Bearing in mind
that the coordination sphere of all species with all hexapeptides is similar we tried to study ZnHL and ZnH.2L
complexes. We chose Zn(ll) /-TASHHK- system for these NMR studies because the above complexes exists
without overlaps at their formation pH range only in the case of the hexapeptide -TASHHK- (Figure 3).
Firstly, H-NMR spectra of-TASHHK- were recorded, at pH* 7.3 and 25 C, in the absence and presence of
Zn(II) ions (ratio 1:1, in D20:H20 1:4 mixture). Unfortunately, the spectrum in the presence of Zn(ll) was
not helpful due to the extensive broadening of all signals which was derived from the high concentration of
free metal ions (Figure 3). Thus, H-NMR (Figure 5) and TOCSY (Figure 6) spectra of-TASHHK- at pH*
10.30 were recorded, in the absence and presence of Zn(II) ions (peptide Zn(II) ratio 1.2:1, in D20:H20 1:4

It is well known that the complexation of several peptides to the metal ions produces significant chemical
shift changes of the signal of the protons near the binding sites in NMR spectra due to the electron density
shift to the metal ions. Obviously, the comparisons of H-NMR and TOCSY spectra between free and bound
-TASHHK- (Table 4) indicated that the positions of the protons of Thr, Ala, Ser and Lys residues were
almost not affected, suggesting that they were not involved in the coordination sphere of Zn(ll) ions. It must
135

be noticed that remarkable chemical shift changes of the signals belonging to a proton were not observed,
suggesting the absence ofbound amide nitrogen from the coordination sphere ofZn(ll) ions.

new peaks were observed comparing with the corresponding spectrum in the absence of Zn(ll) ions and
supporting the complexation of Zn(ll) ions through the imidazole rings of His residues (Figure 5). Most of
them observed above 8.00 ppm may easily correspond to the signals of the peptide hydrogens (-NH-). In

contrast we must report that signals of the peptide hydrogens in the H-NMR spectrum of free -TASHHK-
were not detected. Additionally, it was found that the two new peaks below 8.00 ppm, and two peaks which
are overlapping with the already existing peaks of free hexapeptide, produced two new cross-peaks in the
TOCSY experiment [lm C2-H Im Cs-H: 7.24 6.98 ppm and 7.19 6.95 ppm] (Figure 6) corresponding to
the two His residues in bound hexapeptide. The differences and also the similarity of them in chemical shifts
ofthe signals ofthe imidazole protons observed in both His residues (Table 4), in the presence of Zn(ll) ions,
clearly indicate the participation of both imidazole rings in coordination sphere of Zn(ll) ions. Finally, it must
be mentioned that the chemical shifts of the imidazole protons of free hexapeptide (with negligible changes)
were also detected in the same region of-H-NMR spectrum [Im C2-H lm4
Cs-H: 7.76 ppm 6.98 ppm and
lm C2-H Im Cs-H: 7.71 ppm 6.95 ppm] due to the small excess of ligand we used to achieve shorter
complex formation equilibrium times during the NMR experiments.
Concluding, without exception, the NMR data presented in this paper suggest the same coordination
mode of ZnH.zL complexes {2Nm} with the hexapeptide -TASHHK- as has also been supported by
potentiometric measurements ofthe analogues complexes with all hexapeptides.

CONCLUSIONS
The studies with the blocked hexapeptide models -TESHHK-, -TASHHK- and
-TEAHHK- of the -ESHH- motif of the C-terminal of histone H2A, presented in this paper, support that this
sequence is a potential binding site for Zn(ll) ions similarly with the Cu(ll) and Ni(ll) ions/I 1-13/.
Firstly, a combined use of potentiometric and IH-NMR titrations has allowed us to compare the
macroconstants in protonation equilibria of the two His residues inside the sequence of the studied
hexapeptides. Afterwards the potentiometric titrations in aqueous solutions of hexapeptide / Zn(ll) systems,
indicated that several monomer Zn(ll) complexes are formed in the pH range 5 11. It was found that these
complexes were apparently less stable than the corresponding Cu(ll) complexes with the same hexapeptides
/11,12/. Besides it is well known that Zn(ll) complexes are kinetically labile, leading to several equilibria
between complexes with different donor sets and distorted geometries or between coordinated and
uncoordinated forms /39/. The potentiometric data suggested the initial coordination of all hexapeptides
through both imidazole rings and additionally through the carboxylate oxygen of Glu residue in the case of-
TESHHK- and -TEAHHK-, forming a slightly distorted octahedral complexes similarly with the analogues
Ni(ll) and Cu(ll) complexes with the same hexapeptide models/11-13/, in more basic solutions, the most
probable interpretation of the predominated complexes is the deprotonation of bound water molecules and e-
amino group of Lys residue. The last proposed structures of complexes existing in basic pH values, have
been studied also by one and two (TOCSY) dimensional NMR techniques leading to the same coordination
features.
Obviously, binding of Zn(ll) ions to the C- terminal of histone H2A may inevitably change its
conformation, disturbing the interactions of histone H2A inside the histone octamer with the other histones,
DNA and other molecules. Additionally, it is well known that Zn(ll) ions are able to bind with several
molecules inside the cells, including reduced glutathione (GSH) which is one ofthe most abundant molecules
of life (c 10 mM intracellularly) /40/ and free histidine which also exists in high concentrations (c 0.
mM) and it has been proposed as a carrier of Zn(ll) ions in some tissues/41/. These observations clearly
indicate the great biological interest relative to the binding of Zn(ll) ions inside the cells. Thus, the next step
in our studies needs to ascertain the ability of Zn(il) ions to catalyze the hydrolysis of the studied
hexapeptides in physiological conditions, similarly with Ni(ll) and Cu(ll) ions/9,13,14/.
