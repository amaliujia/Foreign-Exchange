1. INTRODUCTION
Intercalation between parallel base pairs is frequently one of the possible modes of interaction of DNA molecule with active
drugs. Classic intercalators are plane aromatic molecules such as acridines,
phenantrolines, or phorphyrins. The family of the aminoacridines has been
extensively studied [].

The applications in medicine of these chemical compounds started in early 20th century, when derivatives of crisaniline were found to be active against malaria, and euflavine and proflavine were used as antibacterial agents. These compounds were replaced by aminacrine (9-aminoacridine) which has similar effects. Afterwards, when the affinity of the acridines for the nucleic acids and their intercalator effects were
established [, ], the research focused on their possible applications as anticancer agents. However, tests conducted with simple acridines had very
low activity as antitumor drugs []. Systematic studies of the relationship between the
antitumor activity and several factors such as the lipophilicity-hydrophilicity
of the derivatives, their electronic and steric effects have also been carried
out []. Recently,
9-aminoacridine has been assayed, in comparison with other acridine derivatives
such as pharmacotherapeutic for prion disease Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD)
[]. The incorporation
of bulky groups into the acridine moiety does not allow the intercalation of
the chromophor between the DNA base pairs and causes decreasing of the
antitumor activity [].

In parallel, research focussed on the design of
compounds containing several acridine molecules joined by carbon chains in
order to create a DNA polyintercalator effect [–] and on the preparation of
coordination compounds with one acridine group as a ligand [, ] with the objective of obtaining molecules capable of
interaction with DNA by intercalation and by metal-base covalent bond.
Intercalation is a kinetically labile interaction and the additional fixation
of the molecule to DNA by a covalent bond via the metal atom can potentially
increase the activity of these systems as antitumor agents.

The 9-aminoacridine (9AA) molecule has two
symmetrically distributed nitrogen atoms with nucleophilic properties: the
exocyclic N(9) and the endocyclic N(10), which can coordinate to transition
metal atoms. Two tautomeric forms of the free 9-aminoacridine moiety can be
adopted in solution (see ).

Rak et al. [–] have described the presence of these two forms in solution and have demonstrated that the equilibrium
composition changes when the solvent and temperature change, although the
authors do not conclude about what isomer is preferentially formed.

An additional interest of this ligand resides in the
fact that the DNA interaction occurs by intercalation of 9-aminoacridine
between the base pairs of the biomolecule and this is, theoritically,
compatible with the preferential coordination of platinum to DNA [–] by the nitrogen N(7) of the purine bases on the major
groove.

Sundquist et al. [] have
described the synthesis of coordination compounds of formulae cis-[PtCl(9AA)-(NH3)2](NO3) and cis-[Pt(9AA)2
(NH3)2](NO3)2 prepared reacting a derivative
of cisplatin with the ligand 9-aminoacridine (9AA). In the two
complexes, the ligand is coordinated in its imine form, which binds to the
platinum atom in a monodentate fashion by the exocyclic nitrogen atom. Natile
and col. [–] have investigated the
reaction of 9-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]acridines with platinum(II) substrates and
also have studied the endocyclic versus exocyclic N-coordination to
platinum(II) and the role of metal ions and hydrogen bond acceptors in the
tautomeric equilibrium of nitro-derivatives of 9-aminoacridines.

More recently, the interaction of
9-aminoacridine-carboxamide platinum complexes with DNA has been investigated,
particulary their DNA sequence specificity and binding kinetics []. The presence of the
9-amino substituent produces the effect of shifting away from runs of
consecutive guanines (the main binding site for cisplatin). However, an
acridinecarboxamide platinum complex showed a similar sequence specifity to
cisplatin. The same authors prepared cis-dichloroplatinum(II) complexes
tethered to 9-aminoacridine-4-carboxamides and assessed their activity in
several resistant cell lines in vitro []. The sequence specifity and kinetics of DNA adduct
formation for the aforementioned compounds with HeLa cells were also compared
with those of cisplatin, resulting 4-fold faster for DNA-targeted Pt complexes
[]. Platinum-acridine
conjugates were also prepared and tested against several tumor cell lines
resulting active at micromolar concentrations. Mono- and bis-acridinylthiourea
platinum (II) complexes were synthesized by Bierbach's research group [–] with the aim of studying
DNA strands cleavage and binding modes. The interaction of ACRAMTU-Pt complexes
{ACRAMTU = 1-[2-(acridin-9-ylamino)ethyl]-1,3-dimethylthiourea} with DNA have been
extensively studied by Bierbach et al. [–]. Recent results from their
biophysical and biochemical studies suggest
interesting binding mechanisms to the DNA molecule.

Finally, metal derivatives of 9-aminoacridine have
been synthesized as precursors for radio iodination for potential use in
radionuclide therapy [].

Here, the synthesis of new Pd(II) and Pt(II) complexes
of the classic intercalator 9-aminoacridine (9AA), where the ligand acts as a
(C,N)− bidentate group, is presented.
The study of their chemical, structural properties and reactivity with DNA, as
well as their antiproliferative behavior with selected tumor cell lines are
also described.

2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1 Materials and methods
The complexes were prepared using K2[PdCl4] and
K2[PtCl4] from Johnson Matthey (Reading, UK); the solvents used were
purchased from Fluka (Madrid, Spain); and 9-aminoacridine, Calf Thymus-DNA,
and EDTA from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain).

Elemental analyses were carried out on a Carlo Erba
1500 microanalyzer at the Serveis Cientèfico-Tècnics of the University of
Barcelona. Chlorine in the compounds was analyzed by the Shöniger method and
potentiometric titration in a titroprocessor Metrohm 636 provided with a silver
combined electrode. Platinum was determined by flameless atomic absorption
spectroscopy (FAAS) using a Unicam 939 AA spectrometer with graphite furnace;
the measurements were done by addition and the sample was dissolved in DMF to a
concentration of 0.3 mM. Palladium was measured by inductively coupled
plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Thermo Jarrell Ash
polyscan GIE in standard conditions at a wavelength of 340–458 nm. The samples
required prior mineralization to ICP after which they were digested with
concentrated nitric and perchloric acids in pyrex tubes at 220 °C; palladium was dissolved in
100 ml of Milli-Q water in acid medium []. The IR spectra were recorded in a solid state (KBr
pellets) on an FT-IR Nicolet 5DZ spectrometer in the 4000–400cm−1 range and on an FT-IR Bomen
DA-3 (CsBr pellets) for the 400–200 cm−1 range. 1H{13C}, 13C{1H}, and
195Pt{1H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 250 spectrometer using
CDCl3 as solvent in the case of 1H and 13C spectra and DMSO-d6 in the case of 195Pt spectrum due to the low solubility in CDCl3 of the platinum complex.
Chemical shifts were measured relative to TMS in the case of 1H and 13C, and
to K2PtCl6 in the case of 195Pt NMR spectra. Mass spectra were run on a
Fisons VG Quattro triple quadrupole analyzer in the 1800–200 m/z range using
MeCN as solvent under electrospray (ESP-MS).

2.2 Syntheses of the complexes
[Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF
A solution of 0.192 g (0.50 mM) of cis-[PdCl2(PhCN)2] [] in 10 mL of CHCl3 was added
to 40 mL of a solution of 0.097 g (0.50 mM) of 9-aminoacridine in CHCl3. The
mixture was refluxed at 60 °C for 12 hours. A brown solid
was formed after cooling. The resulting precipitate was washed with ethanol and
ethylic ether, and dried overnight under silica gel. The solid was dissolved in
a minimum amount (ca. 5 mL) of a mixture of CHCl3:DMF (100:50) and the solution
was eluted in a SiO2 column (30 × 2 cm) using CHCl3:DMF (100:50) as eluent. The orange band collected from the SiO2 column was concentrated by evaporation under vacuum and a brownish solid was obtained.
Adequate crystals for X-ray diffraction were obtained from a fraction collected from the column after slow evaporation of the solvent Yield: 35%. [Pd2C32H32N6CI2O2] requires: C, 47.07; N, 10.29; H, 3.92; found: C, 46.75; N, 10.40; H, 4.20.

[Pd(9AA)Cl(py- d5)]
This compound was obtained at NMR scale. 0.008 g (0.0098 mM) of [Pd(9AA)(
μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF were dissolved in 0.7 mL of DMSO-d6 and 2 drops of pyridine-d5. The solution immediately changed its color from
brownish to strong yellow.

[PdCl(9AA)(PPh3)]
In a first step, this compound was prepared at NMR
scale, but further it was also isolated in a solid state. 0.004 g (0.0049 mM) of
[Pd(μ-Cl)(9AA)]2 ⋅ 2DMF were
dissolved in 0.4 mL of DMSO-d6 and 0.0026 g
(0.0098 mM) of triphenylphosphine dissolved in 0.3 mL of DMSO-d6 were added. The solution changed immediately from brown color to strong yellow.

The product in solid state was prepared by the following procedure: 0.0257 g (0.0098 mM) of triphenyl/phosphine, dissolved in
the minimum amount of acetone were added to a suspension of 0.04 g (0.049 mM) of [Pd(μ-Cl)(9AA)]2 ⋅ 2DMF in 30 mL of acetone. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour until the solid
disappeared. The final yellow solution was concentrated in a rotavapor and an oil was obtained. 20 mL of diethylether were added to the oil and a yellow precipitate was formed which was filtered and dried. Yield: 82%. [PdC31H24N2C1P] requires: C, 62.32; N, 4.69; H, 4.02; found: C, 62.80; N, 4.50; H, 4.20.

[PtCl(9AA)(DMSO)]
A suspension of 0.106 g (0.25 mM) of cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2] and 20 mL of methanol was
refluxed until the solid dissapeared. A solution of 0.097 g (0.50 mM) of
9-aminoacridine in the minimum amount of methanol was added and the resultant
mixture was refluxed for 16 hour. When the solvent was eliminated, a brownish
solid remained in the bottle. The solid was dissolved in 20mL of acetone. The
solution was filtered on Ceolite, and finally, n-hexane was added until
precipitation of a yellow solid, which was filtered, washed with small amounts
of n-hexane, and dried at the air. Yield: 51%. PtC15H15N2ClOS requires: C,
35.86; N, 5.58; H, 2.99; S, 6.37; found: C, 36.10; N, 5,40; H, 3.10; S, 6.40.

2.3 X-ray diffraction
A [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF prismatic
crystal (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm) was
selected and mounted on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 four-circle diffractometer.
Unit-cell parameters were determined from automatic centering of 25 reflections (12 &lt; Θ &lt; 21°) and refined by least-squares method. Intensities were collected with graphite monochromatized
MoK α radiation, using w/2Θ scan technique.
4911 reflections were measured in the range 2.60 &gt; Θ &gt; 29.97. 4715 of which were non-equivalent by symmetry (Rint (on I) = 0.018). 3681 reflections were assumed as observed applying the condition I &gt; 2σ (I). Three reflections were measured every two hours as orientation and intensity control; significant intensity decay was not observed. Lorentz-polarization, but not absorption corrections, was made.

The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS computer program [] for determination of crystal structures and refined by full-matrix least-squares method with SHELX93 computer program [] using 4665 reflections, (very negative intensities were not assumed). The function minimized was Σw [(Fo)2 − (Fc)2]2, where w = [σ2(I) + (0.0683 P)2]−1, and P = [(Fo)2 + 2 (Fc)2]/3; f, f′, and f″ were taken from the international tables of X-Ray crystallography []. All H atoms were computed and refined with an overall isotropic temperature factor, using a riding model.
Hydrogen coordinates as well as anisotropic thermal parameters are included as supplementary material.

2.4 Formation of drug-DNA complexes
Stock solutions of each compound (1mg/mL) were stored in the dark at room temperature until used. Drug-DNA complex formation was accomplished by addition of CT DNA (Calf thymus DNA) to aliquots of each
of the compounds at different concentrations in TE buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH = 7.4). The amount of compound added to the DNA
solution was designated as (ri) (the input molar ratio of
Pt, Pd, or 9-aminoacridine to nucleotide). The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 24 hours.

2.5 Circular Dichroism
The CD spectra of the complex-DNA compounds (DNA
concentration 20 mg/mL, (ri) = 0.05, 0.10, 0.30, and
0.50) were recorded at room temperature on a JASCO J720 spectropolarimeter with
a 450 W xenon lamp using a computer for spectral subtraction and noise
reduction. Each sample was scanned twice in a range of wavelengths between
220–360 nm. The CD spectra drawn are the mean of three independent scans. The
data are expressed as mean residue molecular ellipticity [ Θ ] in degree cm −1 ⋅ dmol−1.

2.6 Determination of Pt and Pd bound to
DNA
The drug-DNA complex solutions used for CD experiments
were kept; the DNA was afterwards precipitated twice with 2.5 volumes of cold
ethanol and 0.1 volume of 3M NaAcO, pH 4.8. The DNA was washed in 70% ethanol
and suspended in 1mL of TE buffer. The amount of DNA in each sample was
measured by a double-beam Shimazdu UV-2101-PC spectrometer. The platinum and
palladium bound to the DNA was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass
spectrometer (ICP-MASS) Perkin Elmer ELAN-500. The assays were performed in
triplicate.

2.7 Electrophoretic mobility in agarose gel
Commercial solution of pBR322 plasmid DNA, 0.25 μg/ μL was used for
electrophoretic mobility experiments.

4 μL of charge marker were added to aliquot parts of 20 μL of the adducts complex: DNA previously incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The mixture was electrophoretized in agarose gel (l% in TBE buffer) for 5 hours at 1.5V/cm. Afterwards, the DNA was dyed with thydium bromide solution (0.5 μg/mL en TBE) for 20 minutes.

Samples of DNA and adduct cisplatin: DNA were used as control. The experiment was carried out in an ECOGEN horizontal tank connected to a PHARMACIA GPS 200/400 variable potential power supply.

2.8 Atomic force microscopy (TMAFM)
pBR322 DNA was heated at 60° for 10 minutes to obtain OC
form. Stock solution is 1mg/mL in a buffer solution of HEPES. Each sample
contains 1 μL of DNA pBR322
of concentration 0.25 μg/ μL for a final
volume of 50 μL. The amount
of drug added was expressed as (ri), ratio between the molar
concentration of drug to number of base pairs.

Images are obtained with a Nanoscope III multimode AFM
of Digital Instruments Inc. operating in tapping mode.

2.9 Tumor cell lines and culture conditions
Three different tumor cell lines were used in these
experiments: MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, DU-145 prostate cancer cell line,
and HeLa cervix cancer cell line. The protocols used in each case were the
following: MCF-7 cells were routinely maintained in DMEM medium supplemented
with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), DU-145 cells in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% of FBS and 2 mmol/L of glutamine, and HeLa cells in Ham's F-12 medium.
The cultures were kept in an incubator at a highly humidified atmosphere of 95%
air with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

The cells were collected from the medium and were
counted with a hemocytometer. Aliquot parts of 100 μL were placed
in 96 wells (2000 or 3000 cells per well for MCF-7 i DU-145, resp.). The cells
were preincubated without drug for 48 hours (MCF-7) and for 72 hours (DU-145),
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere with
95% of relative humidity. Immediately before to be used, the complexes were
solved in sterile water or DMSO/H2O mixture at a stock concentration of 1mg/mL
and filtered. Aliquot parts of these solutions were added to each well (between
20 and 50 μL of compound
depending on the final concentration required). In any case, the concentration
of DMSO in the solution in contact with the cells was higher than 1%. After
addition of the compound, the cells were incubated for 48 hours in the above
conditions. 20 μL of MTT
solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) were added to each well and were incubated for 3-4
hours more. Then, 150 μL of solution
of solubilization of MTT-formazan crystalls formed (500 mL DMF, 200 g SDS, 20 mL
glacial acetic acid, 10 mL of HCl 2M and water until 1L) were added. The
cellular density was calculated in both, the control cultures and the treated
cultures, measuring the absorbance at 570 nm in an ELISA reader Labsystems
Multiskan Multisoft. The IC50 values were calculated from
the graphic representation of cell survival percentage in function of drug (in μM). The data
were obtained from four independent experiments.

In the case of the HeLa cells, the methodology
followed was basically identical with the following differences: number of
cells per well, 2000, preincubation for 24 hours, incubation for 24 hours, and
concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10 i 50 μM; solution of solubilization of MTT-formazan crystalls, DMSO; wavelength of reading, 490 nm; reader of microplates ELISA, ELX800G from Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The main objective of this work was the synthesis,
characterization, and biological studies of compounds of general formulae cis-[MCl2(9AA)2] (M = Pd ∘ Pt, 9AA = 9-aminoacridine).

One of the most common synthetic routes of complexes cis-[MX2
 (L)] or cis-[MX2 (L)2] consists on the reaction of
the ligand (L) with the compounds M12 [MCl4] (where MI = Na or K, and M = Pd or Pt). The reaction between the 9-aminoacridine and the compounds K2[MCl4] (M = Pd ∘ Pt) was not successful due to their low solubility in organic solvents. (i.e., methanol, ethanol, CHCl3, acetone), in which the ligand is soluble. The use of Na2[PdCl4] yielded a brown solid insoluble in the usual solvents which could not be completly characterized. The 1H NMR and elemental analysis results
suggest that the solid is mainly a mixture of the coordination compounds with 1:1 and 1:2 (metal:ligand)
stochiometries together with lower concentration unidentified species.

Using the compound cis-[PdCl2(PhCN)2] as
starting material in stronger reaction conditions and after purification of the
reaction product by column chromatography, the dimeric cyclopalladate complex
bridged through chlorine atoms of formula [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 (see ) was isolated.

The cycloplatinated compound of formulae [Pt(9AA)Cl-(DMSO)] (), was synthesized by reaction of 9-aminoacridine and cis-[PtCl2(DMSO)2], 2:1, in methanol reflux. It was not possible to isolate the coordination compound cis-[PtCl2(L)2] in spite of that several reaction times (between 30 minutes and 24 hours) and temperatures (between 25 and 70°C) were assayed. The activation of the C–H bond is clearly favored in the conditions used. To the authors'
knowledge, [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] are the
first metallocycle derivatives of the 9-aminoacridine, where the ligand behaves
as a bidentate (C,N)− group. Two cycloplatinated
compounds derivatives of 1-nitro-9-[{(2-alkylamino)ethyl}amino]acridine {alkyl = CH2-CH3 or
CH3} were previously described by Ceci et al. []. In those
compounds, the ligand acts as a monoanionic terdentate (C,N,N′)−, where the platinum atom binds
simultaneously to two exocyclic nitrogen atoms and to the C8 carbon, with the
fourth coordination site occupied by a chlorine atom.

3.1 Reactivity of the “Pd(μ-Cl)2 Pd” moiety in the dinuclear
compound [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2

The reaction of the compound [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 with pyridine-d5 (py-d5) or with triphenylphosphine (PPh3) yielded the corresponding monomeric compounds [Pd(9AA)Cl(L)] (L = py-d5, PPh3) (see ). The lability of the Pd–N bond is lower than that described for cyclopalladated compounds of
five-membered rings derivatives of N-benzylidenaniline [] which react with
triphenylphosphine to give [Pd(C^N)X(L)2] after break of the Pd–N bond ((a)). In spite of the addition of excess of pyridine- d5 or PPh3, the
substitution of the second chloride ligand was not observed.

The new compounds prepared [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF, [Pd(9AA)Cl(L)] (L = py- d5 or PPh3) and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] were characterized by IR and 1H, 
13C, 31P {in the case of [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)]} and 195Pt {for [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)]} NMR spectroscopies. Molecular and crystal structures for the cyclopalladated [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF were obtained by X-ray diffraction.

3.2 FT-IR
The FT-IR spectra in the range 4000–400cm−1 for the 9-aminoacridine and
the complexes [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF,
[Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)], and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] were recorded.

In the zone between 1670–1550cm−1 the stretching ν (&gt; C=N−)1 and bending δ (NH2) bands
can be assigned. The δ (NH2) band of
the free ligand appears at 1670 cm−1 . In the spectrum of the
compound [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)], the form of the bands
between 550–520cm−1, corresponding to the
triphenylphosphine molecules [],
confirms the coordination of the palladium atom to only one molecule of PPh3 .

In the case of the complex [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)], the IR
spectrum shows an additional band at 1032 cm−1 assigned to the stretching
vibration ν(&gt; S=O) of the
dimethylsulfoxide molecule coordinated to platinum atom through the sulphur
atom [].

3.3 1H NMR spectra
The 1H NMR spectra assignments, corresponding to the
free ligand and the complexes [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF, [Pd(9AA)Cl(L)] (L = py- d5 or PPh3) and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)], are collected in . All the spectra were recorded in DMSO- d6 at room temperature with exception of the complex [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] which was recorded in acetone-d6. COSY and TOCSY experiments were used for the
assignment.

The spectrum of the free ligand shows four signals in the aromatic zone, which indicates chemical equivalence of the protons localized to both sides of the symmetry plane of the molecule. The signals were assigned
as described in the literature []. The spectra of the complexes are similar: they
present seven signals (between 6 and 9 ppm) assigned to the protons of the
aromatic CH groups, which demonstrates the loss of symmetry of the ligand as a
consequence of the binding to the metal ion. The presence of only seven
resonances indicates the formation of a σ (Pd–Csp2, aryl)
bond. On the other side, two singlets assigned to the protons of NH groups
appear, confirming the imino form for the ligand.

The value of the chemical shift of proton NH10 is δ = 11.65 ppm for the palladium complexes and δ = 10.73 ppm for the platinum complex. This suggests the presence in solution of a hydrogen bond between the proton bound to endocyclic nitrogen and the DMF molecule present in
the three palladium compounds. This type of interaction can also be observed in solid state, in the crystal structure of compound [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF. In  the 2D spectrum for this complex is represented.

The spectra of the monomeric palladium compounds [Pd(9AA)Cl(L)] (L = py- d5 or PPh3) show, as most significant feature, a strong upshift of the H2 (see ). This fact is usually observed for the proton in orto position relative to metallated carbon
atom in cyclopalladate complexes similar to those studied here [] and it is due to the
proximity of this proton to the aromatic ring of pyridine-d5 or triphenylphosphine in cis position relative to the metallated carbon atom.

A noticeable feature in the spectrum of [Pd(9AA)-Cl(PPh3)] (see ) is that the signal of the iminic proton (NH9) appears as a doublet due to the coupling
with the 31P (3JP-H9 = 5 Hz) nucleous. For the same reason, the H2 resonance appears as a doublet of doublets (4JP-H2 = 5 Hz). The values of these coupling constants are similar to those of analogue compounds described in the literature [].

In the spectrum of the platinum derivative (see ), a signal at 3.49 ppm assigned to the protons of the two methyl groups of DMSO appears. The value of the chemical shift as well as the presence of
satellites due to the coupling with the 195Pt nucleous (3JPt-H(dmso) = 21 Hz) indicate that the DMSO molecule is coordinated to the metal ion. The coupling between the platinum
atom and the H2 (3JPt-H2 = 48 Hz) was also identified. On the contrary, the coupling between the iminic proton NH9, was not observed, probably due to the width of the signal.

3.4 NMR 13C{1H}
13C{1H} NMR spectra of the free ligand and the complexes [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF, [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)], and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] were
obtained.

The signals observed in the 13C{1H} for the ligand
were assigned as previously described in the literature []. The spectra of the
complexes [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF, [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)] and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] show very similar general characteristics. Bidimensional heterocorrelation experiments
1H–13C were used for the assignments.

The seven crossover single peaks of the aromatic zone in bidimensional experiments (see ), which are coincidental with the most intense resonances in the 13C{1H} NMR spectrum, confirm the formation of a σ (M–Csp2, aryl) (M = Pd or Pt) bond.

13C{1H} NMR spectra show as well five signals without
crossover peaks in herecorrelation study that were assigned to quaternary carbons. The less strong of these resonances that appears downshift to the free ligand was assigned to the metallated carbon (C1). This assignment is
confirmed by the existence of 195Pt satellites in the compound
[Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] and for the doublet form due to the coupling with 31P
nucleous in the complex [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)].

The C9 signal appears in the range 171–173 ppm, in
good agreement with the values described in the literature for iminic carbons
in five- or six-member ring cyclometallated compounds derivatives of Schiff bases [].

In the 13C{1H}NMR spectrum of [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)], the couplings with 195Pt nucleous
are clearly observed. The values for the coupling constants (Supplementary
Material available online at doi 10.1155/2007/98732.) are in good agreement
with those described in the literature [].

3.5 31P{1H} NMR spectra
The 31P{1H} spectrum of [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)] (in DMSO-d6) shows a singlet at 40.77 ppm. The position and multiplicity of this signal is consistent with the data described in the literature for the five-membered rings palladacycles with σ (Pd–Csp2, aryl)
bonds [, ] of general formulae [Pd(C^N)X(PPh3)] (X = Cl−, Br−, I− or AcO−), where the phosphine is in trans to the iminic nitrogen.

3.6 195Pt NMR spectrum
The complex [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] has been also
characterized by 195Pt NMR (in acetone-d6). The spectrum
consists in a singlet at − 3756 ppm. The position of the signal [] is similar to that described in the literature for mono- or bis-cycloplatinated compounds of formulae [Pt{[(η5-C5H3)CH(R)N (CH3)2]Fe(η5-C5H5)}Cl (DMSO)] (− 3763 ppm for R = H
and − 3899 ppm for R = CH3) [] and [Pt2[{η5-C5H3CH(R)N(CH3)2}
 Fe]Cl2(DMSO)2] (R = H or CH3) [] where the platinum(II) is surrounded by a CNSCl coordination environment and the ligand DMSO is in trans position to the nitrogen atom bound to the metal ion.

3.7 Crystal structure of [Pd(9AA) (μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF
The main crystallographic data and structure refinement are collected in . The molecular structure of the complex with the numbering of the atoms is shown in . The bond distances and angles are included in Supplementary material. The structure consists in molecules of [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 and DMF in a molar relationship 1:2.

In the [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 molecules, the palladium atoms {Pd(1) and Pd(1#)}  are bound to two lligands {Cl(2) and Cl(2#)} in cis position which act as bridges between the two metal centres. The two coordination sites are occupied by the exocyclic nitrogen {N(9)} and the carbon atom C(1) from
the 9-aminoacridine ligand, confirming the proposal of the formation of a σ (Pd–Csp2, aryl) bond, and the bidentate and monoanionic ligand condition of the
9-aminoacridine.

The molecule could be viewed as the combination of
fragments “[Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]” sharing chlorine bridges to form a “Pd(μ-Cl)2 Pd” unit. The relative position of the metalated ligands is in trans, and the environment of palladium atom is a slightly distorted square plannar.


The bond distance Pd-N {2.023(3)Å} is similar to those
described in the literature for five-membered ring palladacycles derivatives of
organic ligands with &gt; C=N− groups, such
as imines [], oximes
[], or hydrazones
[]. The bond length
for (Pd–C) {1.987(2)Å} is in good agreement with those expected for the bonds
between palladium(II) and a Csp2, aryl (these bond distances are typically in
the range 1.98Å and 2.10Å) [, –].

The bond angles involving palladium atom between
82.72(11)° {C(1)-Pd(1)-N(9)} and 94.31(9)° {Cl(2)-Pd(1)-Cl(2#)} are in good agreement with
those described in the literature for five-membered ring cyclopalladated
dinuclear complexes [Pd(C^N)(μ-X)]2 .

Each of the two halves of the molecule has a
five-membered metallocycle formed by Pd(1), N(9), C(9), C(12), and C(13) atoms,
which is practically planar 
and forms a 3.3° angle with the coordination
plane of the metal.

The units “Pd(μ-Cl)2 Pd” are asymmetric, as
indicated by the value of the bond distances Pd(1)–Cl(2): 2.4741(13) Å and
Pd(1)–Cl(2#): 2.352(2) Å. This result is
consistent with the structural data obtained for dimeric cyclopalladated
complexes with chlorine bridges and trans configuration of the two
palladate groups of general formula [Pd(C^N)(μ-Cl)]2. This is a consequence of the
different influence of the atoms in trans position {the metallated carbon
(C1) and the nitrogen N(9)} [].

The planar unit “Pd(μ-Cl)2 Pd”

forms a 4.9° angle with the metallocycle (see ) and it has a rhomboidal shape. The distance between the two palladium atoms, 3.479(1)Å, is too large to consider the existence of
significant Pd ⋯ Pd interactions.

The bond angle Cl(2)–Pd(1)–Cl(2#) is similar to those
described for compounds of general formula trans-[Pd(C^N)(μ-Cl)]2 containing five-membered
metallocycles [].

the tricyclic system [6,6,6] of the aromatic ligand is
practically planar 
 and it forms a 2.4° angle with the palladacycle.
This is in contrast with what occurs in other reported structures [] where the 9-aminoacridine
is bound to the metal through its exocyclic nitrogen is also present as imino
tautomer and a folding of the side rings with respect to the N(10)–C(9) vector
was found. One of the most significant structural features of the
9-aminoacridine group in the compound [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 is the bond length N(9)–C(9),
1.312(3)Å, which is appreciably smaller than the expected value for a σ (Csp2–Nsp3)
bond and very similar to those described in the literature for complexes
containing the functional group  &gt;C=N− (see
footnote 1) and also for the platinum compound [Pt(L)Cl], where L =
1-nitro-9-[{2-(dimethylamino)ethyl}amino]acridine [] with the presence of the
tautomeric form imino.

Moreover, the bond distances N(10)–C(11) 1.399(4) Å
and N(10)–C(14) {1.379(3) Å} and the bond angle C(11)–N(10)–C(14) {122.3(2)°} in the complex [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 are higher than expected for
an amino form and very similar to those found for the cited platinum complex
[]. These
observations allow to conclude that in the complex [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 the ligand is present in the
imino form and that the functional group &gt;C=N− is included
in the five-membered metallocycle.

The bond distances and angles found for the two
molecules of dimethylformamide present in the crystal structure of [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 ⋅ 2DMF are similar to those described in the literature for complexes containing DMF
crystallization molecules. The distance between the oxygen atom of DMF and the
hydrogen bound to the endocyclic nitrogen, N(10), of the complex
[Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 {O ⋯ H–N(10)=
2.857(4)Å} suggests the existence of intermolecular hydrogen interactions. The
strong downfield shift observed in the proton NMR spectrum assigned to the H10
(δ = 11.65 ppm), could confirm the existence of these interactions in solution.

4. BIOLOGICAL STUDIES
4.1 Circular Dichroism
The molecules
of 9-aminoacridine (9AA) and complexes [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 and [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)]
originate modifications in the spectrum of Calf Thymus DNA at different
values of (ri) selected as it is shown in
. The wavelengths, corresponding to the maximum and minimum values of
the ellipticity, are collected in .

The complexes [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 and [Pt(9AA)Cl-(DMSO)] can
interact with the DNA, in principle, by intercalation of the ligand and/or
forming a covalent bond through the metal ion.

Looking at the spectrum recorded for the CT-DNA
incubated with the complex [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 (see ), a very
strong decreasing of the ellipticity of both, the positive and negative bands,
and a batochromic shift of the bands can be observed. This is the
opposite effect to that observed for the free 9-aminoacridine (9AA) (see )
. In the case of the platinum compound [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] (see )
, the change in the negative band is similar to that of the palladium
compound but the maximum is much less intense.

On the other hand, the amounts of metal incorporated to
the DNA are much higher for the palladium compound than
for the platinum compound (see 
). Moreover, the
complex [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 gives a percentage of metal incorporation
higher than cisplatin at the molar relationships (ri)
used. The small percentage of platinum incorporated to DNA
for [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] may be conditioned by the different
labilization kinetic of 9-aminoacridine and chlorine ions
and/or the fact that the compound [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)]
contains only a hydrolysable chlorine and the most probable
adduct that could be formed with DNA would be monofunctional.


In conclusion, the 9-aminoacridine behaves as a classical
intercalator but the palladium and platinum complexes
produce changes of different nature, probably due to the formation
of a covalent bond or the occurrence of both interactions,
covalent, and intercalation, simultaneously.




4.2. Electrophoretic mobility
In , the electrophoretic mobility pattern of cisplatin,
9-aminoacridine and the complex [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2
are shown. At low values of (ri), a decreasing of the CCC
form mobility for the free 9-aminoacridine molecule (lane
C) can be observed. However, at (ri) = 0.5, the mobility increases.
This behavior is similar to that observed for cisplatin
at higher concentrations than the ones used in this
study. The intercalation interaction usually causes a higher
degree of supercoiling than the one produced by a covalent
cis-bifunctional binding [62].


On the other hand, the electrophoretic behavior of
pBR322, incubated with the compound [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2
(, lane B), is close to that of cisplatin (, lane
A) which seems to indicate that the interaction of this compound
is not only intercalative. This seems to agree with the
results obtained from the circular dicroism study described
in the previous section.



Finally, the complex [Pt(9AA)Cl(DMSO)] (, lane
B) causes slight modifications in the electrophoretic mobility
of the OC while the CCC form retards, which suggests
that the uncoiling of the helix occurs on a minor degree.
It is possible that, in addition to the intercalation, a monofunctional
covalent binding could be established. This result
would agree with the published results for the complex
[PtCl(dien)]Cl, which uncoils the helix about 6°, half of the
value expected for a cis bifunctional binding as int the values
described for cisplatin [].

4.3. Atomic force microscopy

AFM images of the plasmid pBR322 DNA incubated with the
compounds [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 and [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)] for
5 hours and 37°C are presented in Figures  and , respectively.



In all the images supercoiled forms of the plasmid
DNA can be observed. These modifications are likely to
correspond to the strong effect of intercalation of the 9-
aminoacridine ligand.



Supercoiling in the plasmid DNA tertiary structure has
been observed before for other classic intercalators such as
ethydium bromide and planar heterocycles [, ].



In the case of the complex [Pd(9AA)Cl(PPh3)], additional
interaction, probably due to the formation of covalent
bond with the N atom of the purine bases, originates deeper
changes in the structure of the plasmid


4.4. Antiproliferative assays
The “in vitro” growth inhibitory effect of the 9-aminoacridine
and its palladium complex [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2 were
evaluated in three tumor cell lines: MCF-7 breast cancer cell
line, DU-145 prostate cancer cell line, and HeLa cervix cancer
cell line.


In
, the IC50 values for the two compounds against
the three tumor cell lines are collected. The 9-aminoacridine
again presents low IC50 values against the tumor cell lines
assayed. These results suggest a direct correlation with the
conclusions drawn from the studies of interaction with DNA
in previous sections. Many other compounds related to
acridines have demonstrated intercalation in DNA and antiproliferative
behavior []. Although the [Pd(9AA)(μ-Cl)]2
derivative shows higher IC50 values than cisplatin, the parameters
are low enough to merit consideration in further
biochemical studies.

The equation of the plane defined by the atoms Cl(2), Cl(2#), N(9), and C(1) is (−0.1236)XO + (0.9015)YO + (0.4146)ZO = 4.2986. The deviations related to the main plane are Cl(2): −0.035, Cl(2#): 0.037, N(9): 0.045, and C(1): −0.047 Å.

The equation of the plane defined by the atoms Pd(1), N(9), C(9), C(1), and C(13) is (−0.1700)XO + (0.9087)YO + (0.3808)ZO = 4.2078. The deviations related to the main plane are
Pd(1): −0.019, N(9): −0.023, C(9): 0.015, C(1): −0.019, and C(13): 0.008Å.

The equation of the plane defined by the four atoms involved in the unit “Pd(μ-Cl) Pd” is (−0.1050)XO + (0.8943)YO + (0.4350)ZO = 4.2649.

The equation of the plane defined by the 14 atoms involved in
the tricycle system of the acridine molecule is (−0.2109)XO + (0.9051)YO + (0.3693)ZO = 4.0107.
