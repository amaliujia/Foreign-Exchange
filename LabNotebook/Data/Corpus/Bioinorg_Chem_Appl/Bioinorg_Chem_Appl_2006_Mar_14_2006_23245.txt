INTRODUCTION
The number and diversity of nitrogen and sulfur chelating agents used to
prepare new coordination and organometallic
compounds has increased rapidly during the past few years
[–]. The dithiocarbazate
(NH2NHCS2−) and its substituted derivatives have been
investigated [–]. These compounds have received much attention and for further studies because (i) they provide an interesting series of ligands whose properties can
be greatly modified by introducing different organic substituents,
thereby causing a variation in the ultimate donor properties, (ii)
the interaction of these donors with metal ions gives complexes of
different geometries and properties, and (iii) these complexes are
potentially biologically active.

Keeping this in view, it was considered worthwhile to synthesize
tin complexes of some stereochemical as well as biological
importance. During the course of the present investigations, an
attempt has been made to synthesize tin complexes by interacting
Ph2SnCl2 and nitrogen, sulfur containing Schiff bases derived by condensation of heterocyclic aldehydes with
S-benzyldithiocarbazate.

EXPERIMENTAL
Chemicals and solvents used were dried and purified   by  standard methods and moisture was excluded from the glass
apparatus using CaCl2 drying tubes. Melting points were determined in open capillaries and are uncorrected. The ligands
were prepared by the condensation of aldehydes with S-benzyldithiocarbazate as described earlier [].

Syntheses of Ph2Sn(Ll-3)Cl
To a solution of sodium methoxide [sodium methoxide prepared by
sodium metal (0.10 g; 0.0044 mole) in 5 mL of
methanol] a benzene solution of ligands (1.43–1.21 g;
0.0044 mole) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed
for about 4 hours, at this stage, a benzene solution of
Ph2SnCl2 (1.51 g; 0.0044 mole) was added to the
above solution drop by drop and the reaction mixture was starred
along with refluxing for about 6 hours. After cooling, the
precipitated NaCl was filtered off through G-4 alkoxy
funnel.
Excess solvent was removed from the filtrate and the compound was
finally dried in  vacuum and a colored sticky solid was obtained.
 These were then repeatedly washed with dry cyclohexene
and petroleum ether and these complexes were purified by
recrystallization from the same solvent ().

Syntheses of Ph2Sn(Ll-3)2
To a solution of sodium methoxide [sodium methoxide prepared by
sodium metal (0.02 g; 0.0052 mole) in 10 mL of
methanol] a benzene solution of ligands (1.69–1.44 g;
0.0052 mole) was added and the reaction mixture was refluxed
for about 4 hours, at this stage, a benzene solution of
Ph2SnCl2 (0.89 g; 0.0026 mole) was added to the
above solution drop by drop and the reaction mixture was starred
along with refluxing for about 6 hours. After cooling, the
precipitated NaCl was filtered off through G-4 alkoxy
funnel.
Excess solvent was removed from the filtrate and the compound was
finally dried in  vacuum and a colored sticky solid was obtained. These were then repeatedly washed with dry cyclohexene
and petroleum ether and these complexes were purified by
recrystallization from the same solvent. The synthetic and
analytical data of the resulting complexes are recorded in
. For tin, carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, nitrogen,
and chlorine agree with the theoretical values within the limit of
experimental error.

Analytical methods
Tin was estimated gravimetrically as SnO2 and chlorine was
estimated volumetrically using Volhard's method [].
Nitrogen and sulphur were estimated by Kjeldahl's and Messenger's methods, respectively []. Molar conductance measurements
were made in anhydrous DMF at 36 ± 1°C using a systronics
conductivity bridge modle-305. Molecular weight determinations were carried out by the Rast camphor method.

Spectral measurements
The electronic spectra were recorded in methanol on a Toshniwal
spectrophotometer. Infrared spectra were obtained on a
Perkin-Elmer 577 grating spectrophotometer as Nujol mulls and KBr
optics. 1H, 13C, and 119Sn NMR
spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution and CHCl3
solution, respectively, on a Jeol Fx-90 Q spectrometer. TMS has
been used as an internal reference for 1H and
13C NMR. For 119Sn NMR, TMT (tetramethyltin)
has been used as an external reference.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Schiff bases were prepared by the stoichiometric reactions of
S-benzyldithiocarbazate with heterocyclic aldehydes, which
were potentially bidentate. The complexes formed from the different molar
reactions of diphenyltin dichloride with monofunctional bidentate
ligands can be represented by the following equations:




where NSH represents the Schiff bases ligands.

The above reactions are quite facile and could be completed in
6–8 hours of refluxing. The resulting new derivatives are
obtained as colored sticky solid and are mostly soluble in common
organic solvents, DMSO and DMF. The molar conductances of
10−3M solutions of the compounds in DMSO are in the range 9–18 Ohm−1cm2mol−1 indicating their
nonelectrolytic nature. The molecular weights of the compounds
determined by the Rast camphor mothod correspond to the formula
weight, indicating monomeric nature.

Infrared spectra
The infrared spectra of ligands [] show a strong band in the region 3450–3180 cm−1 attributable to ν(NH),
while the band at ∼ 2570 cm−1 due to ν(SH) does not appear. However, it is observed in the solution spectra with
NH frequency disappearing, indicating that there exists a
tautomeric equilibrium [, ] between the two forms as
indicated in . In
these complexes, this band is absent showing thereby coordination
of sulphur to the metal by the loss of thiolic protons of the
ligands. A medium intensity band at ∼ 1315 cm−1 due
to the ν(C−S) vibration is split on complexation
suggesting the participation of the sulphur atom in coordination.

A band of medium to strong intensity at ∼ 1600 cm−1
in the complexes may be assigned to the ν(C=N)
[, ] vibration and which originally appeared in the region
at ∼ 1610 cm−1 in the both the solution and solid
states. The shift of this band to the lower side indicates
coordination of the azomethine nitrogen to the metal atom. The
occurrence of the ν(N−N) and ν(C−S)
bands at a higher frequency in the IR spectra of the complexes as compared to the ligands suggests a reduction of the repulsion between the lone pair of the nitrogen atom [] as a result of coordination via the azomethine nitrogen.

Besides, several new bands in the complexes observed at
∼ 420 cm−1 and ∼ 332 cm−1 may be assigned to ν(Sn ← N) [] and
ν(Sn−S) [], respectively. Finally, in
the case of Ph2Sn(L)Cl type of complexes, a band of medium
intensity around at ∼ 302 cm−1 is due to ν(Sn−Cl) vibration [].

Electronic spectra
In the electronic spectra of the ligands [, ] a band at
∼ 216 nm is observed which may be assigned to the lB band
of the phenyl ring. This shifts to longer wavelength on
complexation and is observed at ∼ 232 nm in the complexes.
Also, the ligands chromophore &gt;C=N, which
is observed at ∼ 290 nm, shifts to higher wavelength and is observed at ∼ 294 nm in the complexes. In the spectra of
ligands, a band observed at ∼ 340 nm due to the secondary
band of benzene and which gets red shifted due to the presence of &gt;C=N−N=C&lt;. However, this appears
at ∼ 370 nm in the complexes possibly due to the
polarization in C=N bond caused by the metal-ligand
electron interaction. Three sharp bands are observed in the
region, 245–268 nm and assigned as charge-transfer bands,
indicating the formation of σ bond [] and (dπ-pπ) [] bonds between p-orbitals of sulphur and
vacant 5d orbitals of tin.

1H  NMR spectra
The above bonding pattern is further supported by proton magnetic
resonance spectral studies of ligands and their corresponding tin complexes. The 1H NMR spectra of the
ligands [] exhibit the −CH2− protons signals at ∼ δ 4.20  ppm, aromatic proton signal around δ 7.60–6.60 ppm, and it remains at the same position in the spectra of the metal complexes. The proton of
NH group of the ligands gives a signal at ∼ δ 10.82 ppm which is absent in the spectra of metal complexes indicating the chelation of the ligand moiety to tin with the sulphur atom.

The signal at ∼ δ 8.50 ppm observed in the ligand is
assigned to azomethine protons, which is shifted
downfield in the spectra of corresponding tin complexes
(∼ δ 9.02 ppm) on account of its deshielding which is
attributed to the donation of the lone pair of electrons by the
azomethine nitrogen to the tin atom.

13C  NMR spectra
13C NMR data have been recorded for all the ligands, namely, S-Benzyl-β-N(indlymethylidene)
dithiocarbazate (L1H),
S-Benzyl-β-N(thienylmethylidene)
dithiocarbazate (L2H), and
S-Benzyl-β-N(furylmethylidene) dithiocarbazate
(L3H) and its corresponding tin complexes
(). The signals due to the carbon atoms
attached to the thionic and the azomethine groups in ligands
appear at δ ∼ 190.3 and ∼ 150.3 ppm,
respectively. However, in the spectra of the corresponding tin
complexes, these appear at δ ∼ 172.8 ppm (thionic
group) and at δ ∼ 160 ppm (azomethine group),
respectively. The considerable shifts in carbons attached to
S and N indicate  the involvement of sulphur and
nitrogen atoms in  coordination.  The carbons of phenyl groups
(Sn−Ph) are observed at position comparable to other
similar compounds.

119Sn NMR spectra
These Ph2Sn(Cl)L and Ph2Sn(L)2 complexes give
sharp signals at ∼ 8 − 235.4 ppm and
∼ δ − 456.8 ppm, respectively in 119Sn NMR
spectra and which strongly support the five- and six-coordination
around tin in a trigonal-bipyramidal and distorted octahedral
geometry, respectively. Values [–] for similar five- and six-coordinated organotin(IV) complexes have been reported in
the ranges of δ – 128 to – 268 ppm and δ − 485 to −503 ppm, respectively.

On the basis of the observed spectral evidence, the
tentative structures shown in  with (probably distorted)
trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral geometries can be proposed.

BIOLOGICAL STUDIES
Antibacterial activity
In vitro antibactericidal activity of the ligands and their
corresponding organotin complexes were tested by the paper disc
diffusion method [, ] at 200 mg/L concentration in
methanol. Streptomycin was used as reference compound for
antibacterial activities. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus, Klebsiella pneumeniae, and Bacillus thurengiensis
were used as the test organisms. The discs having a diameter of
4 mm were soaked in these solutions. These discs were placed
on an appropriate medium previously seeded with organisms in petri
plates and stored in an incubator at 30 ± 1°C. The
inhibition zone around each disc was measured after 24 hours.
Results have been recorded in the form of inhibition zones
(diameter, mm) and activity indices in .

Antifungal activity
The above-mentioned compounds were also screened for their
antifungal activity on Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia
phaseoli, and Penicillium crysogenes. The compounds were
directly mixed with the medium (potato, dextrose, agar, and
distilled water) in different concentrations and the linear growth
of the fungus was obtained by measuring the fungal colony diameter
after 96 hours (). The amount of growth
inhibition in all the replicates was recorded and calculated by the following equation:


where C = diameter of fungal colony in control plate and
T = diameter of fungal colony in test plate.

Further, the organotin complexes are more active than the free
ligands, which indicates that metallation increases antimicrobial
activity. The above studies indicate that the organotin complexes
synthesized in the present studies are highly active against all
these microorganisms. The results reported in Tables  and  reveal that the organotin complexes of dithiocarbazates are more active for all organisms than
corresponding semicarbazones and thiosemicarbazones complexes
reported in our earlier publications [], and this also indicates that sulphur is more effective than oxygen as suggested
by Tandon []. The increase in the activity of tin(lV) complexes as compared to the parent ligand may be due to the
chelate formation in which the ligand is coordinated to the
central tin atom through the thioketonic sulphur and azomethine
nitrogen leading to an increased fungitoxic action. The compounds
containing a halogen atom attached directly to the central atom
also showed moderate activity, but the replacement of halogen by
another ligand moiety enhances the biochemical properties of the
whole molecules. Almost all the compounds were found to be more active against all the microorganisms used than the ligands themselves. The mode of action of the compounds may involve the formation of a halogen bond though
(−N=C−S) [] groups with the active centers of the   cell constituents resulting in an interference with the cell process. The screening data of a particular ligand and its metal complexes show that the former has greater activity than the later from the biochemical point of
view. On comparing the results in general, it may be concluded
that the organotin(IV) complexes have greater inhibiting power
than the free ligands against all the microbes.

Although, it is difficult to make out an exact structure-activity
relationship between the microbial activity and the structure of
these complexes, it can possibly be concluded that the chelation
as well as addition of a substrate enhance the activity of the
complexes. The variation in the toxicity of different
antibacterial agents against different organisms as suggested by
Garrod et al [] depends either on the impermeability of the cell or
differences in ribosomes to the antimicrobial agent. Though
the results suggest that the ligands have remarkable toxic property, their complexes of tin
inhibit the growth of organisms to a greater extent. This is in
accordance with the earlier reports []. Further, the
greater activity of the complexes can also be explained on the
basis of their higher solubility of the particles.
