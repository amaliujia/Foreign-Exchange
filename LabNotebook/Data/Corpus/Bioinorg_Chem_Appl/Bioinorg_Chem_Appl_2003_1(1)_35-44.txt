ABSTRACT
The reactions of mono(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) trichloride and bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/
zirconium(IV) dichloride with a new class of dithiosemicarbazone, derived by condensing piperazine
dithiosemicarbazide with benzaldehyde (LIHz), 2-chlorobenzaldehyde (LzH2), 4-nitrobenzaldehyde (L3H2) or
salicylaldehyde (L4H4) have been studied and different types of binuclear products, viz. [{CpTiC[z}2L],
[{CpzMC1}2L], ((L=LI, L2 or L3), [{CpTiCI}zL4] and [{CpzM}zL4] (M=Yi or Zr), have been isolated.
Tentative structures are proposed for these complexes based upon elemental analyses, electrical conductance,
magnetic moment and spectral (electronic, IR, H and 3C NMR) data. Attempts have been made to establish
a correlation between antibacterial activity and the structures ofthe products.
INTRODUCTION
Thiosemicarbazones and their metal complexes are of considerable current interest because of their
potentially beneficial pharmacological properties and a wide variation in their modes of bonding and
stereochemistry /1-6/. Heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones exercise their beneficial therapeutic properties in
mammalian cells by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of DNA precursors
/7/. Their ability to provide this inhibitory action is thought to be owing to coordination via their N N S
tridentate ligating system. Recent developments in the structural nature of metal complexes of heterocyclic
thiosemicarbazones are correlated with their biological activities. It has been suggested that the
stereochemistries and activities of complexes often depend upon the nature of N(4) substituents and on
groups attached to N(1). Recently, a number of papers have also appeared/4/on bis(thiosemicarbazone)
derivatives (derived from dialdehyde or diketons) in which two thiosemicarbazone moieties are connected by
their imine nitrogens, to N(1) carbon skeleton. However, very few reports are available on

bis(thiosemicarbazones) in which two thiosemicarbazone moieties are connected by their amide nitrogens,
N(4). West et al. named/8/ligands ofthe second category as dithiosemicarbazones in order to differentiate it
from the first category. They also reported/8/Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes of such types of ligands,
viz. N, N/-dimethylethylene diamine or piprazine dithiosemicarbazones.
The present paper describes the synthesis and characterization oftitanium(IV) zirconium(IV) derivatives
with new ligands derived from piperazine dithiosemicarbazide with benzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde, 4-

EXPERIMENTAL
All reactions were carried out under strictly anhydrous conditions. THF was dried by heating under reflux
over sodium wire. The EtN was purified by published methods/9/. Mono(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)
trichloride was prepared from CpzTiClz and TIC14 in p-xylene /10/. Bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/
zirconium(IV) dichloride were prepared /11/ by heating CpNa with appropriate metal chloride in a N
atmosphere. Elemental analyses and physical measurements were made as noted earlier /7/. Piperazine
dithiosemicarbazide was prepared as reported by West et al./8/.
Preparation of dithiosemicarbazones
Piperazine dithiosemicarbazide (0.01 mol) and appropriate aldehyde (benzaldehyde, 2-
chlorobenzaldehyde, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde or salicylaldehyde) (0.02 mol) were dissolved in ethanol (30 cm3)
and to this 2-3 drops of glacial acetic acid was added. The mixture was refluxed for 7-8 hours. The solution
was concentrated to ca. 15 cm and light petroleum (b.p. 60-80) (---10 cm3) was added. The resulting solid
was filtered, washed with cold i-PrOH and dried under vacuum.

Reactions of Cp2MCI and CpTiCI3 with dithiosemicarbazones
To a solution of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)/zirconium(IV) dichloride or mono(cyclo-
pentadienyl)titanium(IV) trichloride (20 mmol) in dry THF (ca. 40 cma) was added the appropriate
dithiosemicarbazone (10 mmol). To the resulting clear solution, EtaN (20 retool) was added and the mixture
was stirred for ca. 12-22 h at room temperature. Precipitated EtaNHCl was removed by filtration and the
volume of the solution was reduced to ca. 15 cm under reduced pressure. Light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 C)
(10 cm3) was then added. The colored precipitate thus obtained was thoroughly washed with Et20 and
recrystallized from 1"1 THF: Et20.
The details and important physical characteristics ofnew compounds are recorded in Table 1. The nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra of ligands and the complexes were recorded on a Bruker 400 spectrometer.
Chemical shifts are expressed relative to an internal reference TMS (1% by volume).

In formulas for the complexes, L is the symbol for the dianion when both of the thiosemicarbazone
moieties have lost their amide proton N(2)H in the piperazine dithiosemicarbazone ligands derived from
benzaldehyde, 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and 4-nitrobenzaldehyde. L represents the loss of both amide protons
and phenolic protons from the salicylaldehyde piparazine dithiosemicarbazone.
Colours, elemental analyses and molar conductivities are listed in Table 1. Complexes are soluble in
dimethylformamide, dimethylsulphoxide, nitrobenzene, tetrahydrofuran. The molar conductances of the
complexes in DMF are in the range 6.0-10.0 ohm
-cm mol,which are well below the range observed for
uni-univalent electrolytes in this solvent. Magnetic susceptibility measurements show that they are
diamagnetic. The electronic spectra of the complexes show a broad band in the 22200-23800 cm,region
which can be assigned /12/ to charge-transfer, a result in accord with their (n-1)dns electronic
configuration. The ligands show bands at ca. 35000 cm and 28000 cm,which are assigned to n--- *
transitions associated with imine and thioamide functions of the thiosemicarbazone moieties, respectively. In
their respective complexes, these bands shift slightly to higher frequencies.
I.R.Spectra
Absorption bands occurring at ca. 3000 cm for v (C-H), ca. 1420 cm for v (C-C) and ca. 1020 cm"1
for
v (C-H) in all the complexes are assigned to the cyclopentadienyl group and indicate that these groups are n-
bonded to the metal/13/.
The i.r. spectral bands most useful for determining the coordination mode for the dithiosemicarbazones
are listed in Table 2. These ligands can exist either as a thione or the thiol tautomeric forms or as an
equilibrium mixture of both forms, since they have a thioamide, -NH-C(=S) function. The i.r. spectra in the
solid state do not show any v(S-H) band but exhibit a medium v(N-H) band at ca. 3150 cm-, indicating that
in the solid state, they remain mainly in the thione form. However in solution they readily convert to the thiol
tautomeric form with the concomitant formation of titanium(IV) zirconium(IV) complexes of the
protonoted mercapto form of the ligands. This is indicated by the absence of-NH band in the complexes.
The i.r. spectra ofthe complexes also show a new band at ca. 600-620 cm owing to conversion/4/of C=S to
C-S-. The new band in the complexes at ca. 380-400 cm"l
is assigned/13/to v(M-S) and shows that sulfur is
bonded to titanium/zirconium atom. The v(C=N) shift of the dithiosemicarbazones from 1570-1560 cm" to
lower energy in the spectra of complexes indicates coordination of the imine nitrogens N(1). However, the
loss of N(2)H's from the two dithiosemicarbazone moieties, by thione thiol tautomerism produces
additional carbon-nitrogen double bonds, N(2)=C(S) which is indicated by the appearance of a band at ca.
1590 cm in the complexes. Bands in the 460-475 cm region are assigned /13/to v(M-N) and support
coordination ofthe imine nitrogens. The v(M-CI) bands have been assigned in the 330-315 cm region.

H N.M.R. spectra
The 1H n.m.r, spectra of the complexes (Table 3) have been recorded in deuterated dimethylsulphoxide.
The line intensities were determined by planimetric integration. A comparison of the ligands with the
complexes leads to the following conclusions:
(a) The 6 6.65-6.80 signal may be assigned to the cyclopentadienyl ring protons and indicate the rapid
rotation ofthe ring about the metal-ring axis.
(b) The signal of N(2)H is seen at ca. 12.60-12.95 in the ligands. In the complexes neither this signal nor a
thiol SH signal is visible.
(c) The chemical shifts at ca. 3.35 ppm can be due to piperazine ring protons which shifted slightly
downfield in the complexes.
aC N.M.R. spectra
The 3C n.m.r spectra of ligands and the corresponding .complexes were recorded in DMSO (Table 3).
The 3C resonance signals are assigned according to chemical shift theory. The compounds show
cyclopentadienyl peak at ca. 8 117 (relative to TMS). A considerable shift takes place in the position of-C-S
(ca. 165 ppm, ligands) and C N (ca. 150 ppm, ligands) indicating coordination through the azomethine
nitrogen and the thiol group. The signal for piperazine group appears at ca. 8 62.8 in the ligands, which shift,
slightly downfield in the complexes.

Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial activity of the complexes together with the parent ligands has been screened/14/against
Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli by the paper disk plate method at 1000
ppm conc. The inhibition zone (mm) around each disk was measured after 24 h and the results of these
studies are listed in "Fable 4. The results lead to the following conclusions:
(a) The complexes are slightly more toxic than the parent ligands.
(b) The titanium complexes show better activity than zirconium complexes.
(c) Mono(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives possess better activity than bis(cyclo-
pentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives.
(d) The best activity was recorded with mono(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives with ligand L_Hz i.e.
containing-CI group at phenyl ring ofthe thiosemicarbazone moieties.
On the basis of elemental analysis, electrical conductance and spectral data, the following structures for
the complexes are proposed.
