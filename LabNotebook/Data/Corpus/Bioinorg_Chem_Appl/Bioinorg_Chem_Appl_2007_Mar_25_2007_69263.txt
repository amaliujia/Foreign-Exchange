1. INTRODUCTION
Organoselenium and organotellurium compounds are finding renewed interest as synthetic reagents in organic synthesis [, ]. In addition to their synthetic
applications, these compounds are fast gaining contemporary
interest due to their indispensable applications in electronic
industry [], as organic conductors [] and precursors for semiconducting materials [], in biology [] and in
medical imaging.

It is curious to note that the chemistry of alkyl, aryl, and mixed alkyl aryl chalcogenides has developed rapidly for the last two decades and is of immense interest to organic chemists [] and biochemists [], whereas the chemistry of pyridyl derivatives virtually remained neglected, in spite of its greater utility []. Recently, the chemistry of pyridyl derivatives has attracted the attention of the scientific
community due to their unique properties, which endear them to the
new and exciting applications in organic synthesis. In recognition
of its importance, renewed efforts have evolved for the convenient
methodologies of their synthesis.

The presence of nitrogen in the aromatic ring brings remarkable
changes and has attracted considerable attention of the practicing
chemists as precursors in pharmacological compounds [], for the preparation of liquid crystals [], in the synthesis of polymers, and as ligands in transition metal complexes.

2. EXPERIMENTAL
All the manipulations were carried under a dry and deoxygenated
nitrogen atmosphere to prevent the oxidation of oxygen-sensitive
intermediates. Elemental sulphur, selenium, and tellurium
(Sigma-Aldrich, Bangalore, India) were stored in a desiccator prior to use.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried using sodium and benzophenone
prior to use. Diisopropylamine (DIA) was distilled using
CaH2  and was stored on molecular sieves. 2-halopyridines (Halo- = F, Cl, and Br), n-butyl lithium of
analytical grade were purchased from Aldrich and used without
further purification. 1H, 13C, and 77Se NMR spectra were recorded on a Jeol AL  spectrometer operating at 300, 75.432, 57.203, and 94.790 MHz,
respectively in CDCl3, using Me4Si  as an internal standard for 1H  and 13C NMR. Me2Se  and Me2Te were used as an external reference for 77Se and 125Te  NMR. IR  spectra were obtained between KBr plates on a Perkin-Elmer model 1430. C, H, and N analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer 2400 CHN analyzer. Mass spectra were obtained on a VG-70S11-250J mass spectrometer. Separation and
purifications of compounds were carried out using column
chromatography performed on activated silica gel using
hexane/ethyl acetate as eluant.

3. SYNTHESIS OF 2-HALO-3-PYRIDYL CHALCOGEN
COMPOUNDS (X = F, CL, AND BR)
A 100 mL three-necked round bottom flask was charged with
20 mL dry THF and 3 mL (22 mmol) DIA under nitrogen
and was cooled to −20°C. To this solution was added
dropwise 17.6 mL (22 mmol, 1.25 M) n-butyl lithium
with continuous stirring and the mixture was allowed to stand for
1 hour at 0°C. To this solution of lithium
diisopropylamine (LDA) was added slowly a solution of
2-halopyridine (20 mmol) in THF (10 mL) at −50°,
−40°, and −78°C in case of fluoro-, chloro-, and
bromopyridine, respectively. Stirring was continued for additional
one hour after which dry and activated elemental chalcogen
(S, Se, and Te) (20 mmol) was added in small portions with continuous stirring. The temperature was raised
slowly up to room temperature. It was found that sulphur and
selenium takes 20–30 minutes to dissolve completely, while
tellurium takes nearly one hour to dissolve, owing to surface
oxidation of the metal. The product was hydrolyzed using 5 mL
solution of aqueous ammonium chloride and nitrogen supply was
discontinued. The reaction was then subjected to aerial oxidation
for 10–12 hours in case of selenols and tellurols. Thiols,
obtained from the hydrolysis of thiolate, gave a poor yield of
disulfides upon aerial oxidation. Therefore, oxidation of thiols
was performed using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at
80–90°C, which is a mild and successful oxidizing agent
for the oxidation of thiols to disulfides. THF was removed on
rota-evaporator; the resulting mixture was diluted with water and
was extracted in dichloromethane (3 × 40 mL). Inorganic
impurities were removed by repeatedly washing the organic layer
with brine (3 × 30 mL) followed by distilled water. The
organic extract was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and
concentrated on rota-evaporator. The product was purified on a
silica column using 10% ethyl acetate-hexane as eluant.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mautner et al. [] were the first to prepare
bis(2-pyridyl) diselenide by reacting 2-bromo pyridine
with toxic hydrogen selenide (see ).

Toshimitsu et al. [, ] modified this synthesis circumventing the use of toxic hydrogen selenide by using sodium hydrogen selenide obtained by the reacting elemental
selenium with sodium borohydride in 2-ethoxyethanol. Bhasin et al.
[] have optimized the use of this reagent for the synthesis of various substituted methyl- and bromopyridyl selenium and
tellurium compounds (see ).

Syper and Mlochowski [] developed a new
methodology for the synthesis of bis(2-pyridyl) diselenide by reacting dilithium diselenide with 2-bromopyridine. Various methyl substituted
2-pyridyl diselenides/ditellurides were synthesized by
Bhasin and Singh [] using a mild and easily
available reducing agent, hydrazine hydrate (see ).

Engman and Cava [] prepared 
bis(2-pyridyl) ditelluride through lithium bromine
exchange of 2-bromopyridine using sterically hindered and highly
reactive t-butyl lithium at −78°C in THF. The
preparation of methyl substituted bis(2-pyridyl)
diselenides and ditellurides were extended by Bhasin et al.
[] using metal-halogen exchange of methyl-substituted bromopyridines using n-butyl lithium.

Heteroatom-directed aromatic lithiation is a versatile route
towards the synthesis of π-deficient heterocycles []. The presence of C−X bond in 2-halopyridines, apart from allowing easy and selective metalation at ortho-position,
makes it potentially reactive towards nucleophiles, allowing the
introduction of other functional groups. Metalation at
ortho-position is facilitated owing to the
ortho-directing ability of halogen substituent,
particularly fluorine and chlorine. Such an intermediate is
potentially reactive towards electrophilic selenium and tellurium metals. Therefore, design of new methods allowing metalation of 2-halopyridine for chalcogen incorporation
with the retention of C−X bond could be of great
synthetic value.

Among the various organolithium reagents, LDA has been known to
bring about selective deprotonation as it is a nonnucleophilic
base and does not lead to metal-halogen exchange reactions in
halogenopyridines, which occur with n-butyl lithium.

In an effort to achieve the synthesis of target compounds, the
deprotonation of 2-halopyridines (X= F, Cl, Br) was
carried out under cryogenic conditions in THF using LDA as base.
Reports from literature indicate that LDA can be used efficiently
to induce exclusive lithiation at C-3 position [] as a consequence of DoM effect (directed ortho-metalation). It was
observed that the use of LDA prevented nucleophilic addition of
base on C=N bond as well as metal-halogen exchange
reactions. The intermediate, 3-lithio-2-haolpyridine, generated
 in situ was reacted with elemental
chalcogen (S, Se, and Te) at low temperature. The insertion of chalcogen atom into C−Li
bond took place readily resulting in the formation of
2-halo-3-pyridylchalcogenolate (). It was
found that sulfur and selenium undergo smooth insertion into the
C−Li bond while tellurium takes time to undergo
insertion. This is possibly due to the metallic character and
passive nature of this element. The resulting solution of
2-halo-3-pyridylchalcogenolate was subsequently subjected to
hydrolysis. The oxidative coupling of resulting thiols, selenols,
and tellurols affords the desired bis(2-halo-3-pyridyl)
dichalcogenide in good yield.

Simple aerial oxidation was sufficient to obtain diselenides and
ditellurides, but thiols had to be oxidized using DMSO to get a
quantitative yield of the desired disulfide ().

In order to ascertain the applicability of this protocol for the
synthesis of various 2-halo-3-pyridyl chalcogenides, a series of
reactions was set up. The results obtained revealed that the
methodology was best applicable to chloro- and fluoro-
derivatives. The yield was lowered to less than half in case of
bromoderivatives. Insertion of tellurium in
2-bromo-3-lithiopyridine gave a poor result to the extent that even the recovery of a substantial amount of compound, sufficient
for characterization, was not possible.

5. SPECTROSCOPIC STUDIES
The compounds prepared () were characterized with the help of various spectroscopic techniques, namely, 1H (), 13C (), 77Se/125Te NMR (), IR, UV-Vis spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallographic techniques.

6. 1H NMR STUDIES
1H NMR spectra of hitherto unknown
bis(2-halo-3-pyridyl) dichalcogenides were obtained in
CDCl3 using TMS as internal reference. The NMR
characterization of dichalcogenides along with the data has been
given in . It was observed that the
1H NMR spectra for the dichalcogenides display three different sets of protons in aromatic region. In case of
bis(2-chlolo-3-pyridyl) diselenide, H-6 proton appears
most downfield and lies in 8.22–8.24 ppm while the signals
corresponding to H-4 and H-5 appear at lower frequencies and fall
in the regions 7.88–7.91 ppm and 7.15–7.19 ppm, respectively. The order of chemical shift values of pyridyl protons follows the order H-6 &gt;
H-4 &gt; H-5. To substantiate these predictions further,
[1H−1H] COSY studies were performed on the newly
synthesized compounds.

7. [1H−1H] COSY (HOMCOR-2D) AND [1H−13C] COSY (HETCOR-2D) STUDIES
2D correlation spectroscopy helps in the assignment of protons and carbon signals
in NMR spectrum, besides providing vital information about
proton-proton and proton-carbon connectivities. The
off-diagonal contours (cross-peaks) allow the identification of
proton signals and help in interpreting 13C NMR
spectrum. [1H−1H] COSY spectrum clearly shows a
correlation of H-5 proton with H-4 and H-6 due to its ortho-position with respect to both. [1H−13C] COSY (HETCOR) correlates the peaks of a proton spectrum with the peaks of 13C spectrum ().

13C peaks have unequivocally been sorted out with the help of
off-diagonal cross-peaks corresponding to 1JC−H coupling interactions. Accordingly, the assignments lie in the order of chemical shift as under C-2 &gt; C-6 &gt; C-4 &gt; C-3 &gt; C-5.

8. 13C NMR STUDIES
As evident from the 13C NMR studies of 2-halopyridines,
the carbon-13 signals resonate downfield with the increasing
electronegativity (F &gt; Cl &gt; Br) of halogen
atom. Carbon atom directly bonded to the halogen experiences
maximum deshielding due to −I effect of halogen. However, the
inductive effect decreases from fluorine to bromine resonance
effect (+R) increases; the carbon atom at para position
with respect to halogen (C-5) shows the reverse trend in observed
chemical shift values.

It appears that in the newly synthesized
bis(2-halo-3-pyridyl) dichalcogenides, due to the
opposing nature of inductive and resonance effect of chalcogen and
halogen atoms, no such generalizations can be made. The
interpretations of [1H−1H] and [1H−13C] COSY () studies and 13C NMR data reveal that in diselenides, C-2 carbon resonates most
downfield relative to TMS.

9. 77Se NMR STUDIES
77Se NMR of bis(2-halo-3-pyridyl) diselenides
(X = F, Cl, Br) were recorded in CDCl3 employing
Me2Se as external reference 
(δ, 0 ppm). It is curious to note that with the increase in the electronegativity of halogen at C-2 position, an upfield shift is observed. It is
also worthwhile to mention that all these compounds exhibit
77Se resonance at higher frequency relative to
bis(2-pyridyl) diselenide. An answer may lie in the
existing intermolecular short contacts operating in the molecule
as evident from the solid-state structural studies.

10. 125Te NMR STUDIES
Chemical shifts are cited with respect to neat Me2Te (δ = 0 ppm) as external reference.

11. 19F NMR STUDIES
The proton-noise decoupled 19F NMR spectra of the fluorinated derivatives were recorded in deuterated chloroform, CDCl3, using trichloroflouromethane, CFCl3 (freon-11) as
the external reference. The 19F signals for both
compounds, bis(2-fluoro-3-pyridyl) diselenide and
bis(2-fluoro-3-pyridyl) ditelluride, were observed as well-defined
signals at −50.62 and −59.3 ppm.

12. MASS SPECTROMETRY
The isotopic richness of natural selenium and tellurium helps in
the identification of selenium and tellurium containing fragments
in the mass spectra of organoselenium and organotellurium
compounds. A number of characteristic ions found in the mass
spectra have been tabulated in .

13. IR STUDIES
This technique has been used for the general characterization of
the newly prepared pyridyl selenium and tellurium compounds. IR
spectra of these compounds were recorded in the range
4000–400 cm−1 in compressed transparent pellets made
from powdered compounds and dry KBr. IR spectra of various compounds synthesized have been summarized in .
