ABSTRACT
The toxicity mechanisms of mercury and tin organic derivatives are still under debate. Generally the
presence of organic moieties in their molecules makes these compounds lipophilic and membrane active
species. The recent results suggest that Hg and Sn compounds deplete HS-groups in proteins, glutathione and
glutathione-dependent enzymatic systems; this process also results in the production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), the enhancement of membrane lipids peroxidation and damage of the antioxidative defence
system. The goal of this review is to present recent results in the studies oriented towards the role of
organomercury and organotin compounds in the xenobiotic-mediated enhancement of radical production and
hence in the promotion of cell damage as a result of enhanced lipids peroxidation. Moreover the conception
of the carbon to metal bond cleavage that leads to the generation of reactive organic radicals is discussed as
one of the mechanisms of mercury and tin organic derivatives toxicity. The possible use of natural and
synthetic antioxidants as detoxification agents is described. The data collected recently and presented here
are fundamentally important to recognizing the difference between the role of metal center and of organic
fragments in the biochemical behavior of organomercury and organotin compounds in their interaction with
primary biological targets when entering a living organism.

INTRODUCTION
Due to the widespread use of the organometallic compounds RnMXm, in particular organomercuriais
RHgX,. R2Hg and organotins RnSnX4., (n 0 4), a considerable amount of these highly toxic xenobiotics
enters various ecosystems /1/. The accumulation of RnMXm in biota leads to a phenomenon relevant to
toxicants transfer to higher organisms and therefore their extremely hazardous impact on human health and
on the environment is a matter ofgreat concern/2,3/.
Within the class of organometallic ecotoxicants, RnMXm, there are considerable variations in toxicity
depending both on the nature of metal atom M, number and nature of the organic groups R and the nature of
species formed in various media. Generally the presence of organic moieties in their molecules makes these
compounds lipophilic and membrane active species/4,5/. Organic derivatives of Hg and Sn are supposed to
induce membrane associated oxidative stress in living organism through different mechanisms including the
possibility to enhance the intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species, H202, 02,HO (ROS)/6-8/.
It is well known that Hg and Sn compounds deplete HS-groups in proteins and glutathione; this process
also results in the production of ROS/7,9/. Enhanced lipid peroxidation, DNA and sulfhydryi homeostasis
damage, the decrease of total glutathione level, the inhibition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione
reductase, Se-dependent and Se-independent glutathione peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases and
perturbation of antioxidant defense system are the consequences of this impact/10,11/. However, little is
known about the molecular mechanisms of organometallics action as exogeneous prooxidant stressors. To
understand the biomolecular mode of organomercury and organtin compounds action as promoters of cellular
oxidative stress, the participation of various R,MXm in key biochemical processes responsible for the
extensive lipids peroxidation and damage ofthe antioxidative defence system should be studied.
The interaction of organic derivatives of heavy metals with free sulfhydryl groups in proteins that leads
to the metal-induced cell death is,well known/12/. The involvement of R,MX,, (with general formula R,M)
in oxidative/free radical reactions, namely in radical chain oxidation of the biological substrate R'H, is purely
investigated (Fig. I). The interaction of R,,M may include the reactions either with peroxyl radicals R'OO or
with hydroperoxides R'OOH that are main intermediates of R'H oxidation and lead to the homolytic
cleavage of C-M bonds and result in the formation of reactive organic radicals R" responsible for the
enhanced lipid peroxidation and cell death.

of the carbon to metal bond cleavage will be discussed as one of the mechanisms of mercury and tin organic

TOTAL LIPIDS CONTENT AS A BIOMARKER OF ORGANOMETALLICS INDUCED
OXIDATIVE MEMBRANE DAMAGE
Xenobiotic-induced lipids peroxidation, as a critical stage in toxicological processes, describes the non-
enzymatic oxidative destruction of fats /11/. The peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic,
linolenic, arachidonic acids) in membrane lipid bilayer leads to the membrane cells damage/9/. The decrease
of the membrane fluidity and potential, permeability to H and Ca2+
ions is observed as a result of lipids
peroxidation.
It has been observed that the presence of 0.15 ppb [(n-C4H9)3Sn]20 caused a highly significant decrease
in the total lipids content in body tissues (digestive gland, gills and foot) of the estuarine edible clam,
Anadara rhombea /13/. Acute (0.05 ppb) and chronic (0.02 ppb) exposures to [(n-C4Hg)3Sn]20 induced
various changes in vital biochemical systems in A. rhombea. The change of the lipids content might be
explained as a consequence of the degradation of the unsaturated fatty acids mediated by organotins. The
influence of (C6Hs)3SnCI and (C6Hs)zSnCI2 on the fatty acids composition in a marine chlorophyte,
Dunaliella tertiolecta Butcher and a marine diatom, Skeletonema costatum (Greville) Cleve, which exhibit
different resistances to phenyltins, were studied in the period of 72 h/14/. The proposition that sensitivity to
phenyltin compounds is related to their fatty acid composition has been confirmed when attempts were made
to grow D. tertiolecta in the presence of (C6Hs)3SnCI ranging in concentration from 2.1.10' to 2.1.10 gM,
and S. costatum in the presence of (C6Hs)3SnCI and (C6Hs)2SnCI2 in concentrations ranging from 8.4.10.5
to
8.4.10.3
IuM and 8.4.10-3
to 8.4.101
IaM respectively. The results show a 45% increase in monounsaturated
fatty acids with a decrease in total polyunsaturated fatty acids that are more easily oxidized substrates.
Enhanced lipid peroxidation in liver, kidney and brain of mice has been observed after exposure to
CH3HgCI (10-40 mg/l in drinking water) for 2 weeks /15/. An increase in catalase and glutathione S-
transferase (GST) activities was observed in the sheaths of the marine phanerogam Posidonia oceanica (L.)
Delile experimentally exposed to inorganic mercury/16/indicating that the antioxidant mechanisms were
overtaxed and could not prevent membrane lipid peroxidation. The effect of HgCI2 on lipid profiles in organs
of freshwater cat-fish (Heteropneustes fossilis) was studied/17/. The daily exposure of HgCI2 0.2 mg/L for
10, 20 and 30 days depleted the total lipids in brain. The content of phospholipids enhanced significantly in
30 days. Liver exhibited elevated levels of total lipids. Kidney showed a marked decrease in the content of
total lipids at higher exposure to HgCI2. The content oftotal lipids and phospholipids was high in muscle.
The membrane lipids composition markedly influences membrane permeabilisation/18/. The direct toxic
effect of (n-C4H9)3SnC1 on growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was inhibited by the enrichment of cells
with linoleic acid. Since the cellular response to organometallic compounds exposure might be influenced by
the supplementation with fatty acids the stability of organs and tissues is expected to depend on their total
content in lipids/19/.
The effect of (n-C4H9)3SnCI observed in the study of two species of amphipods, Rhepoxynius abronius
Barnard (Phoxacephalidae) and Eohaustorius estuarius Bosworth (Haustoriidae), commonly used in
sediment bioassays, showed that the decrease in whole-body lipid content may be an indicator of declining
animal health (and increased sensitivity to toxicants)/20/.

A comparative study on the interactions between R2SnCI2, R3SnCI (R alkyl or phenyl groups) and
model bilayer lipid membranes has been performed using the relative degree of depolarization of the lipid
membrane potential as a parameter of the toxicity/21/. The high lipophilic R3SnCI were the most active
species. It was shown that a correlation exists between depolarization activity and the lipophilicity of R3SnC1
hydrolysis products. The surface charge of modified membranes had a secondary influence on depolarization
efficiency of organotin compounds /22/. The interaction of (n-CaH9)3SnCI and (C6Hs)3SnCI with model
membranes composed of different phosphatidylethanolamines has been studied by means of differential
scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, NMR 31p and IR spectroscopy /23/. It has been shown that (n-
C4Hg)3SnCI and (C6Hs)3SnC! segregate.in phosphatidylethanolamine membranes and disrupt the pattern of
H-bonding in the interfacial region of dielaidoyiphosphatidylethanolamine membranes. The authors proposed
that the specific toxic effects of organotins might be exerted through the alteration of membrane function
produced by interaction of(n-CaH9)3SnCI and (C6Hs)3SnCI with the lipids component ofthe membrane.
The results of various experimental studies show that the degradation of lipids is one of the possible
mechanisms involved in organometallics toxicity.
PEROXIDATION OF UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS IN THE PRESENCE
OF ORGANOMETALLICS
The influence of organometallic compounds RHgX, R2Hg, R,SnX4., bearing various organic groups R
upon the lipid peroxidation level was studied using unsaturated fatty acids model compounds- oleic acid and
methyl oleate as substrates R'H/24-27/.
The monitoring was performed at various temperatures by measuring the total concentration of isomeric
hydroperoxides R'OOH and the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), namely
malonic dialdehyde (MDA), as a marker of the carbonyi compounds formation following the hydroperoxides
decomposition/28/. The difference in substrate modification (oleic acid or its methyl ester) does not affect
the kinetic data of R'OOH formation/24/; therefore the interaction of organometallic compounds with the
carboxylic group in oleic acid might be omitted.
The kinetic data for the oleic acid oxidation (rate constants of R'OOH accumulation k and relative change
in R'OOH concentrations A) in the presence of organomercury and organotin compounds presented in Table
show the dependence of R'OOH formation both on the nature of metal (M) in R,,MXm and temperature.
The increase of R'OOH concentration has been observed in the presence of all organotins under investigation
at 25, 30, 37, 60, 65 and 95C/26/. The kinetic data of hydroperoxides accumulation in the presence of
RHgX, RHg at 37 and 60C demonstrate the principal difference in the mechanistic mode of
organomercuriais action in oleic acid oxidation/25/.
The main products of R'H oxidation are highly reactive species R'OO and R'OOH/28/. Fig. presents
possible pathways of the organometallic compounds reactivity towards these intermediates. The concurrence
between the interaction of RnMXm with either peroxyl radicals or hydroperoxides is expected to be a cause of
their different action. Indeed at 37C the accumulation of R'OOH is a slow process (rate constant-

sl). The concentrations of R'OOH and RHgX, R2Hg are comparable, and the organomercury
compounds interact with R'OOH in protolytic C-M bond's cleavage reactions/28/(Eq. 1,2), confirmed by
using IR, NMR and UV-vis experiments and by the monitoring of MDA accumulation/24,25/:
RHgX + R'OOH
--RHgOOR" + HX ()
R2Hg + R'OOH --+ RHgOOR" + RH (2)
The relative change in R'OOH concentrations (Ai) in the presence of organomercurials at temperature
37C is 50% of the corresponding values for substrate's autooxidation. On the other hand the value of Ai
for carbonyl compounds accumulation in the presence of organomercurials shows a 3-4 time increase when
compared with the corresponding values of substrate autooxidation. Therefore at 37C RHgX, R2Hg have a
prooxidative activity. At temperature > 50C the rate constants for R'OOH formation are higher than the
corresponding parameters for R'OOH decomposition. In this region RHgX, R2Hg interact with the excess of
active oxygen-centered peroxyl radicals R'OO in S.2 reaction/30/(Eq. 3,4).

The loss of R group during the oxidative destruction of (C6Hs)2Hg in oleic acid has been confirmed by
using IR spectroscopy/25/. Fig. 2 represents a change of the absorption bands corresponding to the Hg-C
bond frequencies at 400-500 cm1. The initial spectrum shows the absorption band at 462 cm (Fig. 2, a)
which correspond to C-Hg bond in disubstituted organomercury compound R2Hg. The loss of the intensity of
this band and appearance of a new band at 453 cm (Fig. 2, b-d) which corresponds to the monosubstituted
derivative of mercury proves the formation of RHgX according to Eq.4.

The homolytic cleavage of C-Hg bond leads to the generation of reactive organic radicals R that serve as
initiators in the free radical chain reaction. The main pathway for free organic radicals is the participation in
the initiation step (H abstraction from the substrate molecule R'H).

The promoting effect of RnSnX4.n upon the R'OOH formation depends on temperature as well. Despite
the fact that the increase of R'OOH formation has been observed in the whole range of temperatures
investigated the mechanistic study confirms the assumption of their different mode of reactivity/26/. The
bimolecular radical substitution Sn2 reaction at tin atom can proceed quite easily /31/. The formation of
intermediate five-coordinated Sn species containing radical is preferable when compared with three-
coordinated Hg (Eq. 5-8).

The R'OOH formation rate constants k and the values of R'OOH concentrations relative changes A
increase with the number of R groups in R,SnX4_, at 37C, as can be clearly seen in Table I. However at
60C the rates of hydroperoxides formation and the rate of their decomposition become close; kinetic curves
form typical for radical chain processes, and the participation of RnSnX4., in the interaction with R'OOH
seems to play an important role (Eq. 9).
R'OOH + RnSnX4_, RnSnX3.,(OOR')+ HX (9)
At 90C protolytic decomposition of RnSnX4.n is a major process and the dependence of R'OOH
accumulation on the number of R groups in R,SnX4., takes the opposite character. Fig. 3 presents the kinetic
curves of R'OOH accumulation in the presence of ethyl derivatives oftin.
The reactions (1-9) involve the formation of organometallic peroxides which are unstable and may give
various radical intermediates/31/- promoters of further radical chain processes. Moreover the generation of
metal-centered radicals that interact easily with dioxygen to produce oxygen-centered radicals is also
expected. The reactions of the membrane-active (n-CaH9)3SnX (X OCH3, CI, Br, I) with O.'- have been
investigated in the aprotic solvent system [cis-dicyclohexano-18-crown-6 ether DMSO] using ESR /32/.
Conductivity measurements of (n-CaHg)3SnX solutions demonstrate that these compounds dissociate to
produce (n-CaH9)3Sn cations which interact with O,' to give (la-superoxo)bis(tributylstannyl) radicals. The
authors /32/ proposed that la-superoxo radical complexes play the key role in the initiation of lipid
peroxidation processes in vivo.

THE IMPACT OF ORGANOMETALLICS ON PHOSPHOLIPIDS
The explanation of the biochemical mode of organometallic compounds action (including organic
derivatives of Hg and Sn) follows the concept of the interaction of metal center with electron-donor
heteroatoms in biologically important substrates /1,5,33/. From this point of view, phosphoryl-containing
fragments, e.g. anionic phosphodiester groups (OPO), are important moieties in phosphor- and phosphono-
lipids/34/. From the study of the dimer of bis[(di-n-butyi-3,6-dioxaheptanoato)tin] and tri-n-butyltin-3,6,9-
trioxodecanoate with calf thymus DNA samples it was proposed that both organotin compounds do interact
with DNA, probably at the level of the phosphate groups/35/. The ability of phenyltin compounds to induce
structural changes in the phosphatidylcholine bilayers has been studied by NMR Hand P spectroscopy in
the presence of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride, bromide and iodide. The presence of the surfactant
influences the interaction of phenyltins with model membranes and the changes are dependent on the kind of
the counter-ion/36/. The alteration in lipid profiles induced by mercury has been shown to be time-dependent
/17/. The content of phospholipids in brain of catfish enhanced significantly at 30 days. Liver exhibited
elevated levels of total lipids, phospholipids and cholesterol. By using human HL-60 leukemia cells, it was
shown that (n-C4Hg)2SnCI2 and (CH.)3SnCI induce arachidonic acid liberation or its rearrangement within the
phospholipids before a loss in viability can be detected and an increase of free fatty acid and eicosanoids
before cell death could be detected /37/. Primarily affected is phosphatidylethanolamine which loses
arachidonic acid and, to a minor extent, phosphatidylcholine. The study oriented towards the definition ofthe
78
E. Milaeva et al. Bioinorganic Chemistry andApplications
mechanism by which CH3HgC! induces human T-cell apoptosis shows that cardiolipin, a mitochondrial
phospholipid, was oxidized/38/.
The complexation of RnSnX4_, (n 1-3) with phosphodiester fragments of the lipid bilayer might be the
key step in the interaction of organotins with cell membranes. In that case phospholipids are supposed to play
a protective role, preventing toxic organotin compounds from penetrating the cells and intracellular
components. However, this mechanism does not include the possible carbon to metal bond cleavage.
In order to prove the assumption that the formation of reactive radical species following the homolytic
cleavage of C-Sn bond might be the cause of a toxic action of R,SnXm the synthesis of organotin complexes
with phosphocholine (PC) and dimyristoyl-L-ot-phosphatidylcholine DMPC) as model structural components
of lipids has been achieved and their influence on the oleic acid peroxidation has been studied/27,39/.
Figs. 4a, 4b show the kinetic curves of the R'OOH accumulation in the presence of methyl derivatives of
tin (CH3)nSnCI4_n and their complexes with phosphocholine [(CH3).SnCI4.. ]kePC at 37C. The coordination
of organotin molecules to the phosphocholine moieties does not influence significantly the accumulation of
oleic acid hydroperoxides. This experimental fact allows suggesting that the first step of organotins
interaction with lipids fragment does not prevent the activity of these compounds in radical processes of
lipids peroxidation. Therefore the effect of organotin compounds on cellular membranes may be dependent
upon both the complexation with membrane fragments and the participation in radical/oxidative processes
that leads to the disturbance of lipids bilayer and membrane damage.

LIPID PEROXIDATION IN THE PRESENCE OF ORGANOMETALLICS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO
The data illustrated with the examples of organomercury- and organotin-mediated oxidative damage to
the principal components of the membrane bilayers, confirm the mechanistic concepts on the capacity of
RHgX, R2Hg, RnSnX4_, to generate reactive oxygen species and other active organic intermediates under
physiological conditions/40/. Their redox and radical reactivity may underlay the mechanism of mediation of
oxidative damage to cell constituents. Treatment of the hypothalamic neural cells with methylmercury salt
(10 IaM for 3 h and 5 tM for 24 h) results in increased formation of ROS, and 20% and 56% cell death
respectively/41/. These data suggest that methylmercury-mediated cell killing correlates closely with ROS
generation. A significant increase in the ROS formation rate in rat brain was detected 7 days after the
injection of CH3HgX (5 mg/kg) /42/. The formation of oxygen-centered radical species has several
biochemical consequences; some of them include the interaction of ROS with carbon- or metal-centered
radicals formed in biodegradation of RnMXm.
An in vivo and in vitro comparative analysis of the influence of methyl mercury salts on the lipid
peroxidation as a biomarker of the oxidative stress of the organism has been performed. The in vivo
experiments with rats as testing organisms show the promotion of lipids peroxidation monitored by TBARS
(MDA) concentration's increase when rats were pretreated by intraperetonial injection with CH3HgNO3 (5
mg/kg weight)/43/(Table 2).

NATURAL AND SYNTHETIC ANTIOXIDANTS AS ANTIDOTES AGAINST
ORGANOMETALLICS TOXIC EFFECTS
The involvement of lipophylic organometallic compounds in cellular radical and redox processes means
the promotion of membrane bilayer oxidative destruction due to the generation of ROS and other active
radical species. These events might be prevented or inhibited by the antioxidants present in living organisms.
Cellular self-defense response is manifested by increase of the antioxidant enzyme activities (glutathione
peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, etc.). However
there is strong evidence that intoxication with organic derivatives of Hg and Sn causes a disturbance in the
antioxidative defense system as well/6,11/.
It is a well-known fact that methylmercury cation CH3Hg+
interacts with glutathione in human blood,
leading to glutathione level depletion and enhancement of oxidative stress/46/. Moreover, the decrease of
vitamins E and C contents was observed, for instance, in rat kidney after 12 h administration of mercury
compounds /47/. The changes in glutathione-dependent enzyme activities were studied as effects of oral
exposure to (C6Hs)3SnOCOCH3 for 70 days on hepatic and renal enzymes involved in glutathione
metabolism in rabbits and lambs /48/. The inhibition of glutathione S-transferases isolated from larval
midguts, Spodoptera frugiperda, by (C6Hs)3SnCI has been detected /49/. The authors suggest that the
depression of glutathione S-transIrase and glutathione peroxidase is one part of the complex mechanism of
organotins cytotoxicity. By using a flow cytometry study it was shown that n-C4H9)3SnC! induces a change in
cellular level of glutathione in rat thymocytes/50/.
Since the mechanism of glutathione level decrease by RnMXm is supposed to include the interaction of
metal with S atoms, the sulfur-containing agents can be used as antidotes. Among them
dimercaptocompounds (2,3-dimercaptopropane-l-sulfonic acid, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid,
diethyldithiocarbamate, monoisoamyl meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate) show a significant protective effect on
the toxicity oforganotins and organomercurials/51-53/.
On the other hand the cascade of radical reactions following the accumulation of active species formed
due or from the organometallics biodegradation activates chain radical lipids peroxidation. Therefore the
natural or synthetic inhibitors may serve as detoxificating agents. The first experimental data showing the
protective effect of vitamin E was presented early /54/, accompanying the proposition that free radicals
derived from methylmercury compounds are responsible for oxidative stress.
Indeed, when enhanced lipid peroxidation in liver, kidney and brain of mice has been observed after
exposure to CH3HgCI, the pre-treatment with diets containing c-tocopherol or [3-carotene produces
protective effect /15/. High dietary a-tocopherol protected against CH.HgCI induced hepatic lipid
peroxidation and increased the activity of total glutathione peroxidase and Se-dependent glutathione
peroxidase inhibited by CH3HgCI in the kidneys. Natural antioxidants- vitamin E and ascorbic acid- may
protect against in vivo toxic effects of mercury in the mammalian tissues/55,56/. The in vivo effectiveness of
6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid, used as water soluble vitamin E analog-
antioxidant "Trolox", against the methylmercury-induced cellular responses was demonstrated/57/.
The addition of vitamin E (c-tocopherol) to the diet containing CH.HgNO3 demonstrates the inhibition of
peroxidation level in rat liver homogenates /43/ (Table 4).

Since the key reaction of the active radicals with antioxidant molecule is the abstraction of H atom from

These data make it possible to propose that the rates of radical substitution reactions at metal center are
lower than the corresponding values of hydrogen abstraction by peroxyl radicals of substrates. Nevertheless
the homolytic cleavage of carbon to metal bonds might play a significant role in the mechanism of
organometallics action in the radical and oxidative bioprocesses.
CONCLUSION
The toxicity mechanisms of mercury and tin organic derivatives are still a matter for debate. The
explanations of their biochemical mode of action are inconsistent. The organometallic compounds R,,MXm
(M Hg, Sn) are broad-spectrum biocidal agents whose toxic effect is primarily manifested at the membrane
level due to the lipophilic nature oftheir molecules. The ability of mercury and tin atoms to bind biologically
important molecules through the interaction with heteroatoms of biosubstrates and to disturb mostly protein
systems is well known. On the other hand the involvement of R,MXm in the biochemical reactions in which
the organic moieties and carbon to metal bonds are responsible for the key processes is still purely
investigated. However the dependence of the organometallics toxicity on the type and number of R groups in
their molecules is clearly proved.
The data collected recently and presented here are fundamentally important to recognizing the difference
between the role of metal centers and of organic fragments in the biochemical behavior of R,,MX,,, in their
interaction with primary biological targets when entering a living organism and penetrating a cellular
membrane. Toxic doses of organomercury and organotin compounds are capable of disturbing the natural
oxidation/reduction balance in cells through various mechanisms stemming from their own complex radical
and redox reactions with endogenous oxidants. The consequences of this action produce the effects on
cellular antioxidant systems. The resulting oxidative stress may damage cellular membranes and membrane-
dependent redox sensitive enzymatic systems. This, in turn, may produce a variety of toxic effects, including
pathological processes that lead to cell death.
Therefore there is a strong need to investigate in more depth the principal radical bioprocesses which
involve the organometallic molecules. The understanding of the mechanistic mode of toxic action of
may lead to new approaches for the utilization not only of chelating agents as antidotes against heavy metals
compounds but of inhibitors and antioxidants as preventative additives for the detoxification of heavy metal
organic derivatives.
