ABSTRACT
The reactions of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride with a new class of thiosemicarbazone
(LH2), derived by condensing isatin with different N(4)-substituted thiosemicarbazides, have been studied
and products of type [Cp2Ti(L)] have been isolated. On the basis of various physico-chemical and spectral
studies, five coordinate structures have been assigned to these derivatives. Toxicity studies of titanocene
complexes at tbur different concentrations have been carried out against snail Lymnaea acuminata. The
effect of most potent compounds on the activity of acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which inhibits the activity of
enzyme, possibly by the formation of enzyme-inhibitor complex, was also studied.
INTRODUCTION
The potential antitumour, antibacterial, antiviral, fungicidal and antimalarial activities of
thiosemicarbazones and their metal complexes have spurred the study of the coordination chemistry of these
ligands /1-22/. Heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones exercise their beneficial therapeutic properties in
mammalian cells by inhibiting ribonucleolide reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of DNA precursors/5-
8/. Their ability to provide this inhibitory action is thought to be owing to coordination of iron via their N-N-
S tridentate ligating system, either by a preformed iron complex binding tothe enzyme, or by the free ligand
complexing with the iron-charged enzyme. Studies of iron and copper complexes have shown that they can
be more active in cell destruction, as well as in the inhibition of DNA synthesis, than the uncomplexed
thiosemicarbazones.
Recent developments in the structural nature of metal complexes of heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones,
depicted below, are correlated with their biological activities.

It has been suggested/7,8/that the stereochcmistrics and activities of complexes often depend upon the
anion of metal salt used, the nature of N(4)-substituents and on groups attached to N(I).

The 3-thiosemicarbazones of isatin have been of interest since 1-methyl isatin-3-thiosemicarbazone was
found to be active/23-26/in the treatment of smallpox 40 years ago. Substitution at the N(4) position of the
thiosemicarbazone moiety was found to reduce anti smallpox activity. Substitution of two butyl groups at the
N(4) position yields a compound with demonstrated activity against ectromelia (a vaccina virus) and also
against type 2 polio, which is an entrovirus and quite related to the vaccina family. Though biological activity
of isatin thiosemicarbazones has been studied, there is little published information /27-30/ on the
coordination behavior of this type of ligand. West et al. published/26/a paper on copper (II) complexes with
N(4)-substituted isatin-3-thiosemicarbazones. The present paper describes the synthesis, characterization and
molluscicidal activity of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives with isatin-3- thiosemicarbazones.
The structure of the ligands is shown below (I):

EXPERIMENTAL
All reactions were carried out under strictly anhydrous conditions. THF was dried by heating under reflux
over Na wire. The Et3N was purified by published methods /31/. Bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV)
dichloride was prepared by treating CpNa with the appropriate metal chloride in a N2 atmosphere/32/. The
ligands were prepared by the usual condensation reactions between isatin and thiosemicarbazide in methanol
/26/. The analyses and physical measurements were made as noted earlier/33/.
For the molluscicidal activity, ten experimental snails were kept in glass aquaria containing 3 L of
dechlorinated tap water. Snails were exposed to different concentrations of four compounds [for
Cp2Ti(IPMT) and Cp2Ti(IPMET), concentration used (w/v) mg/L 0.01, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.07; for
Cp2Ti(IPT) and Cp2Ti(IOMT), concentration used: 0.025, 0.05, 0.07 and 0.09}. Each compound was mixed
with nonionic emulsifier and this mixture was used in treatment. Six aquaria were set up for each test group.
Control animals were held in similar conditions without treatment. Mortality was recorded every 24 h up to
96 h. Snail mortality was established by the contraction of the body within the shell, no response to a needle
probe was taken as evidence of death. LC values, upper and lower confidence limits (LCL and UCL) and
slope value were calculated according to the method of the POLO computer program of Russell et al./34/.
For estimation of enzyme activity three sets of experimental aquaria were set up according to the
following dose regimen:
Set 1 Control aquaria contained only dechlorinated tap water.
Set 2 40% of LC.so of [Cp2Ti(IPMET)]
152
G. Vatsa et al. Bioinorganic Chemistry andApplications
Set 3 80% of LCs0 of [Cp2Ti(IPMET)]
Animals were exposed for 24 h. After treatment for 24 h, snails were removed from the aquaria and
washed with water and nervous tissue was taken out for the measurement of AChE activity.
AChE Estimation
The AChE activity was measured according to Ellman et al./35/as modified by Singh and Agrawal/36/
Nervous tissue (50 mg) around buccal mass was homogenized in one ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer (pH=8.0)
for 5 min in an ice bath and centrifuged at 1000 g for 30 min at -4C. Supernatants were used as an enzyme
source. The enzyme activity at 25C was measured in a 10 ram-path length cuvette, using an incubation
mixture consisting of 0.10 ml (5x104M) of freshly prepared acetylcholine iodide solution in distilled water,
0.05 ml of the chromogenic agent DTNB (5, 5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate) reagent, 0.05 ml of enzyme
containing supernatant and 1.45 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH=8.0). The change in optical density at 412
]am (AA/412) was monitored for 3 rain. The protein estimation was done by the method of Lowry et al./37/.
The enzyme activity was expressed at pM "SH" hydrolysed minlmg-lprotein. Each experiment was
replicated at least 6 times.
Preparation of complexes
A mixture of Cp2TiCl2 (30 mmol) and appropriate isatin-3-thiosemicarbazone (30.mmol) was dissolved in
dry THF (ca. 60 cm3). To the resulting clear solution, Et3N (60 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred
for ca. 6-7 h at room temp. Precipitated Et3N.HCI was removed by filtration and the volume of the solution
was reduced to ca. 15 cm under reduced pressure. The colored complex so obtained was recrystallised from
a THF/petroleum ether (1:1) mixture.
The details of synthesis, yields and elemental analyses of the isolated complexes are given in Table 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A systematic study of the reactions of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) dichloride with isatin-3-
thiosemicarbazone (molar ratio 1:1) in anhydrous THF in the presence of Et3N may be represented by the
following equation
THF
Cp.TiCI + LH + 2Et3N [Cp_TiL] + 2Et3N.HC1
[LH2=IPTH-,, IOMTH2, IPMTH2, IOMETH2 or IPMETH2]
Complexes of the type [Cp2Ti(L)] were soluble in CHCI3, DMF, CH3OH and PhNO_. The electrical
conductance measurements show that the complexes are non-electrolytes. Magnetic susceptibility
measurements show that they are diamagnetic.

Infrared Spectra
The characteristic infrared spectral bands of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives are given in
Table 2. The ligands show bands at ca. 3350-3300, 3230-3200 and 1620-1600 cm-,assignable/26/to D(N(4)
H), 19(N(Z)H) and t)(C=N), respectively. In the complex, the first band remains almost at the same position,
indicating the (N4H) nitrogen atom is not coordinated to the metal. The second band at ca. 3230-3200 cm" is
absent in the complexes; however the third band (ca. 1620-1600 cm) is lowered (ca. 15-20 cml) in the
complexes, indicating coordination of the azomethine nitrogen to titanium. In the far i.r. spectra, the bands
at ca. 445-460 cm are tentatively assigned/33/to o(Ti-N) vibration.
The four bands due to thioamide group vibrations/38,39/appear at ca. 1460-1500, 1270-1280, 1040-1020
and 785-760 cm1
in spectra of ligands. These bands of the ligands, due to the mixed contributions of 5(N-H),
(C-N), )(C-S) and 5(C-H) vibrations, are found to be absent in the spectra of the complexes. The
disappearance of thioamide bands in the complexes indicates the possibility of thione .... thiol
tautomerism. The i.r. spectra show a new band at ca. 600 cm owing to conversion of C=S into C-S-. The
new band in the complexes at ca. 370-385 cm1
is assigned to (Ti-S), and shows that sulfur is bonded to
titanium. In addition, the spectra of the ligands show bands at ca. 3180 and 1680 cm which are assigned/26/
to o(N-H) and t)(C=O) vibrations of isatin moiety. These bands disappear in titanium (IV) complexes, which
may be due to enolization of keto group. This is further confirmed by the appearance of new bands at ca.
1570 and 1525 cm assignable/40/newly formed (C=N) and (NCO) groups. The coordination through
enolic oxygen through deprotonation is confirmed by the appearance of band at ca. 480 cm assignable/41/
t(Ti-O) vibration.
Absorption bands occurring at ca. 3000 cm" for v(C-H), ca. 1420 cm for t)(C-C), ca. 1010 cm and 810
cm for (C-H out of plane deformation) in the complexes are due to the cyclopentadienyl ring. These bands
are similar to those reported for bis(cyclopentadienyl)-titanium (IV) dichloride and their appearance indicate
that the (rl5-Cp) group persists in the complexes.
Thus, the infra-red spectra reveal that isatin-3-thiosemicarbazones behave as dibasic, tridentate ligands
coordinating through thiol sulphur, enolic oxygen and azomethine nitrogen.
H n.m.r. Spectra
The IH nmr spectra of the [Cp2TiL] type complexes have been recorded in DMSO-d6. (Table 3). Coupling
between various groups complicates the spectra, but a comparison of the spectra of ligands with those of the
complexes can lead to the following conclusion"
(a) The 6 6.65-6.80 signals may be assigned to the cyclopentadienyl ring protons and indicate the rapid
rotation of the ring about the metal ring axis.
(b) The signals of N(2)H and N(4)H are seen at ca. ;5(9.2) 1H and 6(8.9) 1H, respectively, in the ligands.
The spectra of the complexes show the absence of first peak and the presence of second peak almost at
the same position.
(c) The chemical shift due to aromatic ring appears at ca. 7.8-8.1 ppm, which slightly shifts downfield in
the complexes. This may be due to decrease of electron density after forming the complex.

The peak due to N(I)H of isatin ring appears at ca. 11.2 ppm in the spectra of ligands which disappear
in the corresponding complexes.

3C n.m.r. Spectra
The 3C nmr spectra of [Cp2TiL] type complexes were recorded in DMSO-d6. The following are the
salient features.
(a) The peak due to cyclopentadienyl groups appears at ca. 116 (relative to TMS).
(b) The ligands show amide C(2) and thioamide C(10) at ca. 5160 and ca. 5150, respectively. In the
complexes, these signals are at significantly higher field. The significant shift in the position of C(2)
(ca. ) 130-135.8 in the ligand) may be due to enolization of the keto group and formation of new
azomethine linkage. The signal due to C(3) appears in the region (ca. ) 125.8-128.6).
On the basis of elemental analysis, electrical conductance measurements and spectral data, the following
structures (II) are tentatively proposed for [Cp2 Ti(L)] complexes.

Molluscicidal Activity
The molluscicidal activity of bis(cyclopentadienyl)titanium(IV) derivatives against snail Lymnaea
acuminata was recorded. This snail is the intermediate host of Fosciola hepatica, which causes endemic
fascioliosis in the cattle population of eastern U.P. (India). The effect of sublethal exposure of
[Cp2Ti(IPMET)] on acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity in the nervous tissue of snails was studied. AChE is
responsible for the termination of cholinergic impulses by the hydrolysis of acetylcholine released during
synaptic transmission.

Batches of 10 snails were exposed to four different concentrations of the above treatment. Morality was
determined every 24 h. Each set of experiment was replicated six times.
Laboratory toxicity evaluation of all the four compounds was both dose dependent and time dependent.
Toxicity of [Cp2 Ti(IPMET)] (LC50=0.098 mg/L for 24 h) was highest against L. acuminata (Table 4). It is
clear that all four compounds are potent molluscicides and their toxicity is more pronounced with respect to
other synthetic molluscicides /36/. The 96h LCs0 of Mexacarbamates 1.7 mg/L, carbaryl 4.4 mg/L,
157

Phorate: 15 mg/L, Formathion: 8.5 mg/L are higher than those of bis(cyclopentadienyl) derivatives of
titanium(IV). The order of 48 h toxicity against L. acuminata is :[Cp2Ti(IPMET)]> [Cp2Ti(IPT)] >
[Cp2Ti(IOMT)] > [Cp2Ti(IPMT)] (Fig. 1). The slope values were steep and results were found to be within
95% confidence limits of LCs0. Steep slope value of ldp line indicate that a small increase in the
concentration of compound cause large mortality in snail. The t-ratio greater than 1.96 indicate that a
regression is significant. Heterogeneity factor values less than 1.0 denote that in the replicate tests of random
samples, the concentration response line would fall within 95% confidence limit and thus model fits the data
adequately. The index of significance of potency estimation (g) indicates that the value of the mean is within
the limits at all probability levels (90%, 95%, 99%) as it is less than 0.5. Sublethal treatment of
[Cp2Ti(IPMET)] caused significant change in the AChE activity in the nervous tissue of L. acuminata. 40%
and 80% of 24h LC.s0 treatment caused a reduction in AChE activity up to 32% (0.35+0.022
.tm'SH'hydrolysed/min/mg/protein) and 28.85% (0.101+0.007 tm'SH'hydrolysed/min/mg/protein) of
control (0.35+0.022 tm 'SH' hydrolysed/min/mg/protein), respectively.

It can be concluded from the present study that [CpzTi(IPT)], [Cp2Ti(IPMT)], [CpzTi(IOMT)] and
[Cp_Ti(IPMET)] adversely affect the neurotransmission mechanism in the snail. These compounds are both
metabolised in the snail body and transformed into more toxic form than their parent compounds or in due
course of time i.e. from 24 h to 96 h exposure, there is an increase in concentration of the compound inside
the snail body, which ultimately cause more mortality at higher exposure period.
