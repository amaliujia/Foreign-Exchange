INTRODUCTION
Reactions of dihalogens (I2, Br2)
and interhalogens (IBr, ICl) with organic molecules containing group 16-donor atoms (LE; L = organic framework, E = S, Se) have received renewed interest
in recent years. This is due to two principal reasons: their
intrinsic interest and their implications in different fields of
research which span from synthetic to biological, material, and
industrial chemistry. For example, 1-methyl-imidazole-2-thione
and related molecules show considerable antithyroid activity in
vivo via I2 complexation 
[–]; I2 and IBr adducts of perhydrodiazepine-, and piperazine-2, 3-dithione derivatives can oxidize gold(0), 
palladium(0), and platinum(0) [–]; a similar activation of metal(0) powders is observed with the I2 adducts of phosphine sulfide compounds [–]; complexes between I2 and sulfur containing molecules can have interesting electrical properties [].

These reactions, particularly using chalcogenone donors featuring
a &gt;C=E (E = S, Se)
double bond can follow a variety of pathways depending on both the
acid/base nature of the reactants and the experimental conditions
used, the most important one being the formation of neutral
charge-transfer (CT) “spoke” adducts featuring almost linear
E−X−Y moieties [X = Y = I, Br or X = I, Y = Br, Cl (E = S); X = Y = I or
X = I, Y = Br, Cl
(E = Se)]
[, , –] or insertion adducts containing “T-shaped” X−E−Y fragments [X = Y = Br, Cl (E = S); X = Y = I, Br, Cl, or X = I, Y = Br (E = Se); other X−E−Y hypervalent compounds are obtained by
different synthetic strategies, see Devillanova et al in this
issue of BC&amp;A] [, , , , , –]. Other different structural archetypes have also been established
by X-ray diffraction analysis for the products of these reactions;
they mainly include ionic products such as two-chalcogen-coordinated halogen(I) complexes [(LE−X−EL)+] [, , , ], and
dications containing a chalcogen-chalcogen single bond [(LE−EL)2+] [, , , , ]. Polyhalides of exciting structural complexity can be found as counteranions of these ionic compounds [, , ]. A significant example is represented by the distribution of products from the reactions of
N-methylbenzothiazole-2(3H)-thione (1) and N-methylbenzothiazole-2(3H)-selone (2) with I2, Br2, IBr, or ICl ().

This variety of products, besides being very puzzling from a
kinetic and thermodynamic point of view [, , , , ], 
represents a serious challenge when it comes to characterize the
outcome of the reactions between chalcogen-donor ligands and
dihalogens and interhalogens, especially when an X-ray crystal
structure determination is not possible. The FT-Raman spectroscopy
was proved to be of particular help in giving qualitative
structural information particularly in the case of compounds from
reactions with diiodine []. However, a confident
correlation between structural features and vibrational properties
requires the analysis of a large number of crystallographically
characterized compounds for each structural motif available.

Here we will not attempt to give an overview of all of the
knowledge on the reactivity of chalcogen-donor molecules towards
dihalogens and interhalogens; instead, we will focus our attention
exclusively on the chemical bond and structural features, and on
the main information the FT-Raman spectroscopy can confidently
give about each particular structural motif so far characterized
for the compounds obtained by reacting chalcogen donors with
dihalogens/interhalogens.

DISCUSSION
Charge-Transfer adducts
Most of the reported structurally characterized neutral CT adducts
have sulfur as the donor atom and diiodine as the acceptor
molecule [, –]. Those obtained
from molecules containing selenium and diiodine are less numerous
[, , –], while few adducts of S- and Se-donors with IBr [–, –, –] and ICl [, , , , , ] have been reported and structurally characterized in the literature. Three Br2 adducts of S-donors have been characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis [, ], and no CT adducts of Te-donors are known with any dihalogen or interhalogen.

The interaction between LE chalcogen-donor molecules
(E = S, Se) and XY dihalogens and interhalogens (X = Y = I, Br; X = I, Y = Br, Cl) to give adducts containing an almost linear E−X−Y
fragment can be seen as a charge-transfer process. It occurs via
the transfer of charge density from a lone pair of electrons on
the donor atom to the empty σ* orbital of the halogen
species, producing a lowering in the X−Y bond order. The
consequent increase in the X−Y bond length can be finely
tuned by using donors of different strengths, which means changing
either the chalcogen-donor atom or its chemical environment.

Under such circumstances, the E−X and X−Y bond
distances should be strongly correlated in CT adducts. In fact, a
scatter plot of d(S−I) against d(I−I)
distances () for all I2 adducts with sulfur-containing molecules (including those featuring
I2 bridging two donor molecules, and those featuring chains of I2 molecules anchored to a donor molecule) shows a close relationship between these two distances [, , ], which initially was defined as a hyperbola-like
[]. A similar relationship is found between
d(Se−I) and d(I−I) for all I2 adducts with Se-donors () [, ]. Analogous relationships should be expected for IBr and
ICl adducts with S- and Se-donors, but the
number of the reported structures is so low that it is not
possible yet to establish them conclusively. However, it is
possible to demonstrate that the structural features of the
E−I−Y moiety (E = S, Se, Y = I, Br, Cl) for I2, IBr, and ICl adducts are subject to the same kind of relationship, by considering the net increase in the I−Y bond distances upon coordination Δd(I−Y) instead of the absolute d(I−Y) value [Δd(I−Y) = d(I−Y)adduct − d(I−Y)gas phase] [, –]. In fact, the scatter plot of Δd(I−Y) versus d(E−I) (Figures  and ) clearly indicate that for both S- and Se-donor molecules, the d(E−I) and d(I−Y) bond distances (E = S, Se; Y = I, Br, Cl) observed within CT adducts with IY acceptor molecules are correlated and
show the same degree of variability.

The experimental data in Figures  and , 
except those for I2 adducts characterized by bridging I2 molecules (E−I distances lying between 3.01 and 3.30 Å and I−I distances between 2.74 and 2.79 Å, E = S, Se) [] and the data for the adduct benzimidazole-2(3H)-thione·I2 [], can be fitted very well to the equation []

obtainable by assuming a valence (bond order) model for the
description of the E−I−Y system within CT 
adducts, with n(I−Y) + n(E−I) = 1 
(E = S, Se; n = bond order) [, ], with d0(E−I) = 2.396 Å and 2.528 Å (experimental values for E = S, and Se, resp)
[], b1 and b2 are parameters.

The exclusion of the experimental data for CT I2 adducts characterized by I2 bridging two-donor molecules from the fitting procedure is justified by the fact that these systems are very different from the usual CT adducts in terms of MO
description. In fact, the consequence of extending the simple n
→ σ* description for the donor/acceptor
interaction in terminal I2 adducts to a system in which an I2 molecule bridges two-donor molecules (n → σ* ← n) is that only two electrons have a bonding nature, since the other two occupy a nonbonding orbital. However, these two bonding electrons are distributed over
three bonds instead of over two, and much longer
S ⋯ I and shorter I−I bond distances are expected [, ]. On the other hand, the fact that the
structural data for the adduct benzimidazole-2(3H)-thione·I2 do not fit the generalized Δd(I−Y) versus d(S−I) correlation (Figures  and ) can be accounted on the basis of the fact that, in this compound, the terminal iodine atom is strongly H-bonded to an adjacent and symmetry-related adduct unit []. This interaction lengthens both the S−I and the I−I bonds with
respect to the values generally observed in terminal I2 adducts. In fact, in this adduct, the sum of S−I and
I−I distances is 5.81 Å, which is quite different
from the value of 5.61 ± 0.05 Å [] obtained by averaging the values for the other “spoke” I2 adducts reported in the literature (5.34 ± 0.03 Å is the average value for the sum of S−I and I−Br in IBr adducts, 5.22 Å is the average value for the sum of S−I and I−Cl in ICl
adducts, whereas 5.70 ± 0.04, 
5.53, and 5.33 Å are the average values for the
corresponding sums for I2, IBr, and ICl
adducts with Se-donors, resp, standard deviation is
reported only for mean values obtained by averaging a conspicuous
number of data (more than 10)). Interestingly, for the adduct
5-chloro-benzimidazole-2(3H)-thione·I2
[], where the terminal iodine atom also participates in a
strong hydrogen bond, the sum of S−I and I−I
distances is 5.55 Å, and the structural parameters very
well fit the generalized Δd(I−Y) versus
d(S−I) correlation.

CT I2 adducts (the most numerous) were classified into three categories [, ]. (i) Weak or medium-weak
adducts characterized by a mutual perturbation
effect between the donor and the I2 molecules. The I−I bond order [n(I−I)], defined by the
equation d(I−I) = d0 − c log n (where d0 is the I−I bond distance for I2 in the gas phase and c is an empirical constant with a value of 0.85), in these
systems ranges from values slightly lower than 1 (unperturbed
I2 molecule, d(I−I) = 2.715(6) Å in the solid state) [] to no less than 0.6 (d(I−I) &lt; 2.86 Å). (ii) Strong adducts characterized by n(I−I) ranging between 0.4 and 0.6 (2.86 Å &lt; d(I−I) &lt; 3.01 Å). (iii) Very strong adducts in which the donor-acceptor interaction is so strong that n(I−I) becomes lower than 0.4 (d(I−I) &gt; 3.01 Å). Figures  and  clearly show that I2 adducts with S-donors are mainly weak adducts, whereas those with Se-donors are strong ones.

Considering the Δd(I−Y) parameter, this
classification can be extended to IBr and ICl adducts under the approximation that the range of Δd(I−I) defining the three categories for I2 adducts are roughly valid also for IBr and ICl adducts: values of Δd(I−Y) lower than 0.18 Å are indicative of weak or medium-weak adducts;
Δd(I−Y)&gt; 0.34 Å is indicative of a very
strong donor/acceptor interaction; 0.18 Å &lt; Δd(I−Y)&lt; 0.34 Å corresponds to strong adducts.
Figures  and  clearly show that IBr and ICl adducts with both S- and Se-donors
are strong adducts [, , , ].

This classification was initially introduced to bring order among
FT-Raman data recorded for a large number of structurally
characterized I2 adducts []. Indeed for weak or medium-weak I2 adducts (d(I−I) &lt; 2.86 Å) a linear
correlation was found between the measured ν(I−I)
Raman frequency and the I−I bond length, with
ν(I−I) shifted towards lower values (in the range
180–135 cm−1) as compared to the stretching
frequency of I2 at the solid state (180 cm−1) [] as a consequence of adduct formation (). For strong I2 adducts, two main peaks are generally detected in their FT-Raman spectra, ascribable
to the symmetric (ν1, 120–115 cm−1) and antisymmetric (ν3, 145–125 cm−1) stretching modes of the E−I−I three-body system
(E = S, Se); a much less intense peak in the
range 100–80 cm−1 due to a bending mode (ν2) is also observed (lower attention will be paid to this vibrational mode in this paper) [, , ].  clearly
points out the differences in terms of FT-Raman behavior between
weak and strong I2 adducts; in fact, the antisymmetric (ν3) stretching frequency (having a major contribution from the I−I stretching) observed for the strong adducts does
not fall within the linear correlation ν(I−I) versus
d(I−I) found for weak I2 adducts. For IBr and ICl adducts, which are strong adducts according to the above classifications, much less structural and FT-Raman data are available, therefore generalizations are less reliable. IBr adducts with both S- and Se-donors show one main peak in their FT-Raman spectra in the range 190–140 cm−1 [, , , –, ] at a lower frequency with respect to solid IBr [216 cm−1, d(I−Br) = 2.521(4) Å] [], and it is assignable to a stretching vibration of the E−I−Br three-body system having a major contribution from the ν(I−Br) vibration []. ICl adducts (only four out of seven are both structurally and vibrationally characterized) [, , ]
generally show in their FT-Raman spectra two main peaks: one in
the range 240–180 cm−1 presumably due to the
antisymmetric (ν3) stretching vibration of the
E−I−Cl three body-system
(E = S, Se), and the other at about
130 cm−1 due to the symmetric (ν1) stretching vibration (solid ICl is characterized by a single peak at 283 cm−1 in its FT-Raman spectrum with a
d(I−Cl) = 2.446(6) Å) []. Interestingly, by considering the Δd(I−Y) parameter
(Y = I, Br, Cl), a linear correlation appears also to exist between Δd(I−Br) and ν(I−Br) for IBr adducts, and between Δd(I−Cl) and the ν(E−I−Cl) stretching mode corresponding to the νantisym in symmetric three-body systems, for ICl adducts ().

Very few examples of very strong adducts with chalcogen donors are
known, for which no vibrational characterization has been
reported. Very strong adducts between group-15 donors (P, As, Sb) and dihalogens/interhalogens are more numerous [–]. The vibrational properties of these systems reflect the nature of the [D−X]+
cation interacting with a Y− anion [, ].

The classification for the CT adducts based on the I−Y
bond order can also be extended to trihalides such as
XY2− (X = I, Br; Y = I, Br, Cl). In fact, these can be formally considered CT adducts between a Y− anionic Lewis base and an XY Lewis acid. Under this point of view, symmetrical or slightly asymmetrical trihalides can be considered
belonging to the class of strong adducts, whereas strongly
asymmetric trihalides can be considered belonging to the class of
weak adducts. Spectroscopic implications of this are analyzed
below. Usually a three-centre, four-electron (3c, 4e)
bonding scheme is applied to these triatomic anions. This accounts
for the 0.5 bond order calculated in symmetric systems (the
empty pz orbital of a 6-electron low-spin central
X+ cation interacts, in the D∞h point group, with the out-of-phase symmetry orbital combination (σu+ in D∞h) obtained from the lone pairs of two terminal Y− anions to produce a bonding and an antibonding MO, the other symmetry orbital combination (σg+ in D∞h) becoming a nonbonding orbital) []. Some authors have extended this description to the three-body system
E−X−Y in CT adducts between chalcogen donors and
dihalogens/interhalogens [, ], thus pointing out the
strict structural and spectroscopic analogy of these compounds
with trihalides. Before considering these analogies more in
detail, it is better to describe from a structural and
spectroscopic point of view the class of compounds known as
polyiodides which apparently have nothing to share with CT adducts
of chalcogen donors with dihalogens and interhalogens.

TRIIODIDES AND HIGHER POLYIODIDES SPECIES
It is well known that I2 is the dihalogen having the highest ability to catenate, thus affording oligomeric polyanions
which can assume a wide range of structural motifs [, ].
This tendency to catenate decreases considerably on passing to
dibromine and dichlorine [].

Most of the known polyiodides have the general formula
(I2m+n)n− which formally implies the addition of m  I2 molecules to n iodide ions. Examples of small polyiodides belonging to this family, such as I3−, I42−, and I5−, are very numerous in literature, but the occurrence of discrete I2-rich higher polyiodides (from I7− to I224−) becomes increasingly rare as m and n increase [, ]. On the basis of structural data, all known higher discrete polyiodides can be considered derived from the donor/acceptor interaction of
asymmetric I3− and/or I− with I2 molecules that emerge slightly elongated [I−I ∼
2.75–2.80 Å, (I3−)I− ⋯ I2 ∼ 3.2–3.6 Å]. ∠ (I3−) I−−I−I bond angles are frequently observed at 90 or 180° but can deviate considerably from these values with longer (I3−)I− ⋯ I2 bond lengths.
Polyiodides can be regarded, therefore, as weak or medium-weak
adducts of the type [(I−)n−y · 
(I3−)y· (I2)m−y], whose
geometrical and topological features can be very different and
often unpredictable. Some of these polyiodides are present in the
crystal lattice as discrete aggregates, but they frequently form
polymeric chains or extended 2D or 3D networks in the polyanionic
matrix via I ⋯ I cross-linking soft-soft secondary interactions: these generally range from 3.6 Å up to the van der Waals sum for two iodine atoms (4.3 Å), and the identification of the basic polyiodide unit can became
arbitrary. This extraordinary ability of I2, I3−, and I− to interact with each other to
give polyiodides is affected profoundly by the size, shape, and
charge of the associated countercation, and these parameters have
been considered in recent papers to achieve control over their 3D
architecture [, , , –].

From the above, it is clear that in the absence of a crystal
structure determination, it becomes very hard to guess the nature
and the structural features of polyiodide anions. The FT-Raman
spectroscopy can only give valuable information on the nature of
their building blocks.

In the linear and symmetric I3−, the Raman-active symmetric stretch (ν1) occurs near 110 cm−1, while the antisymmetric stretch (ν3) and the bending deformation (ν2) are only infrared-active. The latter two modes become Raman-active for asymmetric I3−, in which case they are found near 134 (ν3) and 80 cm−1 (ν2), having medium and medium-weak intensities, respectively, as found for strong CT I2 adducts. For highly asymmetric I3− ions, which can be considered weak adducts between I− and I2 [I−·I2], as found in neutral
I2 adducts with S-donors, the FT-Raman spectrum
shows only one strong band in the range 180–140 cm−1, 
indicative of the presence of a perturbed I2 molecule [, , ].

As already mentioned, all the higher polyiodide species may be
regarded as weak or medium-weak adducts of the type
[(I−)n−y· (I3−)y· (I2)m−y]. Consequently, the corresponding FT-Raman
spectra will show peaks due to perturbed diiodine molecules for
[(I−)n· (I2)m] systems (y = 0), and characteristic peaks due to both perturbed diiodine molecules and symmetric or slightly asymmetric I3− ions for polyiodies of the types [(I3−)n · (I2)m−n] (n = y ≠ 0) and [(I−)n−y · (I3−)y · (I2)m−y] (n &gt; y ≠ 0). It is therefore evident that except for the presence or absence of symmetric and slightly asymmetric I3− units, the Raman technique is unable to distinguish between the different types of polyiodides or to discriminate unambiguously between the polyiodides and the neutral I2 adducts with chalcogen donors. However, it can give valuable information on the extent of the lengthening of the I−I bond, whether or not it has been produced by
interaction of I2 with a neutral donor or an ion. Furthermore, FT-Raman spectroscopy cannot give any structural
information on the topological features of an extended polyiodide
network as the technique cannot elucidate the structure beyond the
basic polyiodide units in terms of combinations of I−, I2, and I3− units.

A further complication to the interpretation of FT-Raman spectra
of polyiodides may arise when the basic polyiodide unit sits on
special crystallographic positions. For example, in [Ag([18]aneS6)]I7 [], the complex cation is embedded in a 3D polymeric polyiodide matrix of I7− anions. The overall structure of the [(I7)−]∞ network can best be described as a distorted cube in which I− ions occupy the lattice points of a primitive rhombohedral lattice with one slightly elongated I2 molecule placed along each edge bridging two I− ions. Each I− interacts with six diiodine molecules arranged in a perfect D3d symmetry. Because all six I2 molecules have the same I−I bond distance, only one peak should be present in the FT-Raman spectrum below 180 cm−1. However, the stretching
vibrations of the six individual I2 units can combine, and in D3d symmetry they give rise to two Raman-active normal modes of A1g + Eg types.
The observed bands at 179 and 165 cm−1 can therefore
be assigned to these two modes, respectively. A lowering of the symmetry due to different bond distances for the two perturbed I2 units will split the Eg mode, thus causing the appearance of three bands in the FT-Raman spectrum. Similarly, the case of the I5− ion with a C2v symmetry in 
[Ag([9]aneS3)2]I5 [] can be tackled: the vibrations of the two individual I2 units combine to give normal modes of the A1 + B2 types. A lowering of the symmetry due to different bond distances for the two perturbed I2 units will increase the energy of the higher energetic stretching normal mode and lower the energy of the lower energetic stretching normal mode.

It may also happen that polyiodides are unstable under the laser
beam and cause spurious peaks to appear in their Raman spectra.
This is more likely using visible excitation sources and resonance
Raman spectroscopy; using near-infrared laser excitation sources
and FT-Raman spectroscopy, such problems, particularly
fluorescence and photoreactions, can be considerably reduced.
Nevertheless, decomposition of polyiodides during spectrum
acquisition must be always considered and ascertained before
passing on to the assignment of the FT-Raman bands in order to
avoid confusion with the scattering from decomposition products
(generally driven from loss of diiodine molecules).

After this concise overview on polyiodides, it is worthy to point
out the vibrational analogies in terms of FT-Raman that can exist
between I3− and I2 adducts with chalcogen
donors.

Strong CT I2 adducts, in particular those formed by Se-donors, present two main peaks in their FT-Raman spectra assigned to the antisymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of the Se−I−I three-body system (see above). The
observed frequencies are very close to those normally recorded for
asymmetric triiodides. On the other hand, weak or medium-weak CT
I2 adducts, in particular those with S-donors, present only one peak in their FT-Raman spectra assigned to the stretching mode of the perturbed diiodine molecule (see above).
The observed frequency is indistinguishable from that recorded for
very asymmetric triiodides. Thus the groups
Se−I−I and (I−I−I)−, and
S ⋯ I−I and I− ⋯ I−I
give very similar FT-Raman spectra. This fact can produce
confusion when chalcogen donors are reacted with diiodine, and no
X-ray diffraction analysis of the products is available: the
formation of a triiodide, and, more broadly of a polyiodide, can
be erroneously invoked in the presence of neutral adducts and vice
versa.

HYPERVALENT CHALCOGEN COMPOUNDS
The pivotal role of the vibrational properties of
I3− and other trihalides in the assignment of the FT-Raman peaks for the products obtained by reacting chalcogen donors with dihalogens/interhalogens is even clearer by
considering the class of hypervalent compounds.

Hypervalent chalcogen compounds featuring a linear X−E−Y moiety [X = Y = I, Br, Cl; X = I, Y = Br, Cl; E = S, Se] can be considered to derive formally from the oxidative addition of an X2 or XY molecule to the donor molecule containing the chalcogen atom. With donors of the types R2C=E (E = S, Se) and R2E (E = S, Se), the structural features of the
corresponding adducts is well explained by the VSEPR model, 
according to which the geometry at the chalcogen atom is a
pseudotrigonal bipyramid (tbp) with the halogens occupying the
apical positions, in the case of R2C=E donors (two lone pairs and one bond pair in the plane perpendicular to the X−E−Y direction), and disphenoidal in the
case of R2E ones (one lone pair and two bond pairs in the plane perpendicular to the X−E−Y direction).
These compounds are commonly referred to as, respectively, 
10-E-4 and 10-E-3 systems, indicating that the chalcogen
atom E is formally associated with five pairs of electrons, only
four or three of which are bond pairs (), 
respectively []. As with a trihalide or a CT adduct (see above), the chemical bond in the X−E−Y
fragment can be described using the 3c, 4e bonding scheme, which implies a total bond order of 1 (0.5-bond order
for each E−X bond in symmetric systems). This description
agrees with the qualitative observation that on increasing the
electronegativity difference between the halogen and the
chalcogen, hypervalent chalcogen adducts are formed more easily
than CT adducts bearing an E−X−Y linear group on
reacting chalcogen donors with dihalogens and interhalogens.
Indeed, no hypervalent sulfur compounds containing the
I−S−I moiety are known, and only three
hypervalent selenium compounds containing the
I−Se−I framework have recently been structurally
characterized [, ]. Only three examples of a
Br−S−Br type hypervalent sulfur compound with
dibromine have been structurally characterized [, , ], 
while analogous compounds from selenium containing substrates are
numerous [, , , , ]. As expected, hypervalent
sulfur and selenium compounds containing the linear
Cl−E−Cl (E = S, Se) group
are very well known [, , ]. For the oxidative addition of interhalogens (IBr, ICl), only two examples of “T-shaped” adducts featuring I−E−Br (E = S, Se) moieties are known (for the
hypervalent compound featuring the I−S−Br
fragment, no X-ray characterization is reported) [, ].

The strict analogy between trihalides and hypervalent chalcogen
compounds is clearly pointed out also by the Raman spectroscopy.
In fact, it has been shown that hypervalent Se-compounds featuring a linear I−Se−I moiety show in the
low-frequency region of their FT-Raman spectra one or two peaks
depending on whether the I−Se−I fragment is
symmetric or slightly asymmetric, which are very similar to those
arising from a symmetric or asymmetric I3− []. Therefore, the groups Se−I−I (strong adducts), (I−I−I)− (triiodides), and
I−Se−I (hypervalent compounds) can be
undistinguishable from a Raman point of view.

The same analogy is also found for hypervalent chalcogen compounds
featuring a Br−E−Br linear system
(E = S, Se). In fact, the vibrational
properties of a Br−E−Br group resemble those of
(Br−X−Br)− anions
(X = I, Br) [, , , ]. The FT-Raman spectrum of a symmetrical Br−E−Br group only
shows one Raman peak near 160 cm−1 (see
), as found in symmetric Br3− and IBr2− anions, which can be assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration of the
three-body system. Asymmetric Br−E−Br groups
display an additional and generally less intense peak at around
190 cm−1 (see ), as found for
asymmetric Br3− and IBr2− anions, which is assigned to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of the Br−E−Br or (Br−X−Br)− three-body systems (E = S, Se; X = I, Br). These analogies are quite evident from Figures  and  []. Unfortunately, in the literature no spectroscopic data are available for chalcogen-hypervalent Cl2 adducts, thus preventing a structural/vibrational comparison of the Cl−E−Cl (E = S, Se) framework with the anions (Cl−X−Cl)− (X = I, Br). Overall, we can say that strong I2 adducts (generally deriving from Se-donors), XY2− trihalides (X = I, Br; Y = I, Br, Cl), and hypervalent chalcogen compounds featuring a linear X−E−X moiety (X = I, Br, Cl; E = S, Se) can all be described with the same MO bonding scheme (3c, 4e) and show very similar vibrational properties whose features depend on whether they are symmetric or
asymmetric. On the other hand, weak I2 adducts (generally feturing S-donors) have FT-Raman spectra similar to those recorded for very asymmetric triodides or polyiodides of
the type [(I−)n · (I2)m].

TWO CHALCOGEN-COORDINATED HALOGEN(I) COMPLEXES
Salts of two-chalcogen-coordinated halogen(I) complexes [(LE−X−EL)+] can be formally considered as a central X+
(X = I, Br, Cl) coordinated by two donor molecules. The chemical bond in the resulting E−X−E almost-linear framework can be described according to 3c, 4e bonding scheme, as for CT adducts, trihalides, and hypervalent chalcogen compounds. So far, only cations of this kind formally featuring a central I+ interacting with either S- or Se-donors have been isolated from the direct reaction of chalcogen donors
and dihalogens (see Devillanova et al in this issue of BC&amp;A), and have been structurally characterized [, , ]. Similarly to what is observed for the three-body system in CT adducts (E−I−Y, E = S, Se; Y = I, Br, Cl), trihalides (X−I−X, X = I, Br, Cl), and hypervalent compounds (X−E−X, E = S, X = Br, Cl; E = Se, X = I, Br, Cl), also in these cations there is a correlation between the two E−I bond distances
(E = S, Se): the reinforcement of one
I−E bond corresponds to a lengthening of the other, the
total length of the E−I−E framework being almost
independent of the nature of the substrate incorporating
the chalcogen. The mean value of the E ⋯ E
distance is 5.28 Å for S−I−S and
5.50 Å for Se−I−Se systems (these
distances are very similar, resp, to the averaging value for the sums of S−I and I−Cl in ICl adducts with S-donors (5.22 Å), and Se−I and I−Br in IBr adducts with Se-donors (5.53 Å)).

Unfortunately, very few spectroscopic data are available for
iodonium salts in the literature, and generally the FT-Raman
spectra are dominated by the absorption peaks due to the
polyiodide counteranions. Therefore, a structural/vibrational
relationship cannot be established. However, on the grounds of
what has been said, and considering S/Cl and Se/Br mass similarities, the Raman peaks for the stretching vibrations of the E−I−E (E = S, Se) three-body systems could fall, depending on the organic framework, at frequencies reasonably close to those observed for ICl adducts with S-donors or ICl2− trihalides (E = S), and IBr adducts with
Se-donors or IBr2− trihalides (E = Se).

CONCLUSIONS
The results reviewed in this paper clearly point out that the
reactions of chalcogen donors with dihalogens or interhalogens can
afford a great variety of products depending on the nature of the
donor, the reaction molar ratio, and the experimental conditions
(solvent and temperature). In the absence of an X-ray diffraction
analysis, the FT-Raman spectroscopy can be of help in elucidating
the nature of the products obtained. However, much attention must
be paid in the assignment of the Raman peaks recorded in order not
to make confusion. In fact, the vibrational behavior in the
low-frequency region is sometimes undistinguishable for very
similar three-body systems: E−I−Y (E = S, Se; Y = I, Br, Cl) in CT adducts, X−E−X (E = S, X = Br, Cl; E = Se, X = I, Br, Cl) in hypervalent chalcogen compounds, and E−I−E (E = S, Se) in two chalcogen-coordinated halogen(I) complexes, which can all be described according to a 3c, 4e bonding scheme. Very recently, a vibrational analogy has also been found between I2 adducts of Se-donors and complexes of bidentate phosphate selenide ligands with mesitylenetellurenyl iodide featuring a Se−Te−I linear systems []. The problem is even more complex if the vibrational analogy with trihalides IY2− (Y = I, Br, Cl) is considered. For example, the groups Se−I−I (strong adducts), I3− (asymmetric triiodides), and I−Se−I (hypervalent compounds) are undistinguishable from a Raman point of view, as well as the
Br−E−Br group (E = S, Se) being vibrationally very similar to Br3− and IBr2− anions.
