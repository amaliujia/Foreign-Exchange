1. Introduction
Germanium  is a constituent of many
medicine plants such as ginseng root, and it is considered to play an important
role in the pharmacological effects of the plants []. It is reported
that many organogermanium compounds can inhibit tumor and metastatic growth and
modify immune response by inducing interferon-γ (IFN-γ), enhancing NK cell activity, and increasing peritoneal
macrophage activity [–]. Besides, they are of extremely low
toxicity [, ]. So, many researches focus on searching for effective
and low-toxic antitumor drugs from organogermanium compounds [ –]. 
Several types of organogermanium compounds have been investigated and found to
possess antitumor effect [–], such as tetraalkylgermanium and
alkylgermanium halide [], spirogermanium [], germanium
sesquisulfide [] or sesquioxide [, ], germatranes [], Ge-porphyrinates, and germanium
compounds containing phosphorus [–], of which Ge-132
(carboxyethylgermanium sesquioxide) has been clinically used [, ].

For
developing more effective antitumor agents from organogermanium sesquioxides,
we synthesized five new organogermanium sesquioxides and investigated their antitumor
activities against KB, HCT, and Bel cells. The compound with the highest antitumor
activity was selected for 99mTc labeling and  biodistribution
study in nude mice bearing human colonic xenografts.

2. Experimental
2.1. Agents, Experimental Animals, and Instrumentation
All commercially available chemicals were of
analytical grade and used without further purification. 99mTcO4− was provided by Syncor company with radiochemical purity greater than
98%.

Experimental animals (Balb/c nude mice)
were provided by Experimental Animal Department of Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences. The nude mice were implanted with human colonic carcinoma cells (LoVo cells). When the tumor size was about 1 cm, the mice were used for the
experiment.

IR spectra were
recorded on a Bruker Equinox 55 spectrometer, US. Elemental analyses were
determined on a Yanaco CHN Corder MT-3 elemental analyzer. Mass spectrum (MS)
was detected on a Bruker APEX IV FTMS mass spectrometer. Radioactivity was
counted on a HY-901 γ counter
provided by Sixin company.

2.2. Chemical Synthesis
The scheme of synthesis route is shown in . The
details of synthetic method were described by Niu [].

2.2.1. Reagents

Cl3GeH was prepared by the method reported by
Bai et al. []. 0.01 mol of GeO2, 2 mL of 50% H3PO2,
and 9 mL of HCl solution (11.9 M) were mixed and refluxed for  4 hours. A colorless
Cl3GeH solution was obtained. The solution was extracted three times
with ether to give Cl3GeH solution in ether.

anhydride (II) was prepared by the method reported by Tian et al. []. 
0.5 mol of maleic anhydride, 0.6 mol of furan, and 50 mL of anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran were mixed and stirred to dissolve the maleic anhydride at 37°C. The solution was placed in room temperature for 2~3 days until the
crystals were formed. The crystals were filtered, dried, and then
recrystallized with ethanol to obtain II. mp: 125~127°C.

7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboximine (III) was
prepared by the method reported by Liu et al. []. II was added to
25 mL of ammonia liquor (14.8 M) under stirring. The mixture was refluxed in
boiling water for 1 hour to yield yellow solution. The solution was cooled and
stood overnight. Needle crystals were formed. The crystals were filtered, dried,
and then recrystallized with 95% ethanol to obtain III. mp: 173~175°C.

50% hydrated hydrazine was added dropwise to 0.06 mol of I in water. The mixture
was refluxed in boiling water for 1 hour to yield purple solution and then
stood overnight. Lamellar crystals were formed. The crystals were filtered, dried,
and then recrystallized with distilled water to obtain IV. mp: 145~146°C.



(6) Ethyl Glutamate (V)
To prepare ethyl glutamate (V), a mixture of glutamic
acid (0.2 mol) and anhydrous ethanol (100 mL) was refluxed in an oil bath. 
Dry hydrochloride gas was ventilated until the amino acid was dissolved
completely. Then we
stopped heating and continued to stir the reaction mixture for 1 hour. 
Evaporation of the excess ethanol in vacuo resulted in light yellow oil. 40 mL
of distilled water was added, and the pH of the solution was increased by the
addition of 8 g of NaOH and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was
extracted three times with ethyl acetate (15 mL), dried (with anhydrous Na2SO4),
and concentrated in vacuo to give V as a light yellow oil.

solution of V (4.0 g) in ether, and the solution was stirred for 6 hours. A
white sticky precipitate was formed and filtered off. The filtrate was
evaporated in vacuo to remove ether. Adding 10 mL of distilled water and
stirring for 6~7 hours yielded a white precipitate. The precipitate was
filtered, washed three times with distilled water, and dried to give compound 4
as a white or light yellow powder.

2.2.4.

Addition of distilled water (20 mL) yielded a bright yellow precipitate. The
solution was kept stirring for 2 hours. The precipitate was filtered, washed
three times with distilled water, and dried to give compound 5.

2.3. Antitumor
Activity
The antitumor activity in vitro was assayed by the MTT
method [] using DMSO as solvent. The tumor inhibition yield and IC50 of the five organogermanium sesquioxides and Ge-132 against KB (human
nasopharyngeal cancer), HCT (human colonic cancer), and Bel (human liver
cancer)  cells were measured.

2.4. Radiolabeling
with 99mTc
Since
compound 5 showed best antitumor activity, it was selected for further
radiolabeling and biodistribution studies. To the solution of compound 5 in NaOH solution (2 mol/L), 100 μL freshly
prepared SnCl2·H2O solution was added, and pH was
adjusted to the required value. 3700~5500 kBq
of 99mTcO4− eluate  was added, and the solution was stirred for 5~25 minutes to give the labeled compound. Labeling yield was measured by TLC
with polyamide membrane in the solvent of (CH3)2CHOH : NH4OH : H2O = 15 : 13 : 5 (v/v/v). Rf: labeled compound: 0.3~0.4, 99mTcO4−: 
0.5~0.6, 99mTcO·xH2O: 0~0.1. Reaction conditions were
optimized by varying the concentration of germanium sesquioxide solution and
reducing agent (SnCl2), pH, temperature, and reaction time.

2.5. Biodistribution
Twelve nude mice bearing human colonic cancer
xenografts were injected in tail vein with 555~740 kBq of 99mTc
labeled compound 5. Three animals were sacrified at 1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, and
20-hour postinjection, respectively. Tissues and organs were excised, rinsed,
weighted, and counted in a γ counter. The uptake percentage of the injected
dose per gram of the measured organ (ID %/g) and the ratio of ID %/g of tumor
over normal tissues (T/NT) were calculated.

3. Results
3.1. Preparations
The compounds were
prepared under mild condition. All the five compounds are powder and stable
under ordinary conditions. They all are not soluble in water, alcohol, slightly
soluble in DMSO, but compounds 3, 4, and 5 are easily soluble in 2 mol/L of
NaOH solution.

The elemental analysis data and IR spectra were
consistent with the expected structure of the compounds. In IR spectra, the
wide absorption band at 800~900 cm−1 corresponds to the
characteristic region of νGe–O. The
weak absorption peak at about 550 cm−1 corresponds to the
characteristic region of νGe–C.

MS was performed on compound 5 dissolved in the
mixture of DMSO and methanol. The solvent was selected because DMSO was the
solvent for measuring antitumor activity, and methanol was used to decrease the
viscosity of the solution to facilitate MS detection. MS showed the compound
containing two germanium atoms with m/z 456.815. The m/z value corresponds to
the molecular weight of the formula [Ge(CH2)3NHCSNHCH3]2O3 which may be formed by methylation of [Ge(CH2)3NHCSNH2]2O3 by methanol in DMSO.

3.2. Antitumor Activity
The antitumor activities of the five compounds and
Ge-132 at the concentration of 1, 10, and 50 μg/mL were tested. All the
five compounds showed no antitumor activity at the concentration of 1 and 10 μg/mL. The
antitumor activities of the compounds at the concentration of 50 μg/mL are
listed in . The results of bioassay show that compounds 4, 5 exhibit
certain activities against cancer cells, but compounds 1, 2, 3 show no
antitumor activity. Compound 5 shows the
highest antitumor activity. Its inhibition yields to KB, HCT, and Bel cells are
92.9%, 84.9%, and 70.9%, respectively. IC50 is smaller than 10−7 M (IC50 &lt; 10−7 M is considered as strong inhibition,
IC50 = 10−7~10−6 M as medium inhibition, and
IC50 = 10−6~10−5 M as weak inhibition). Ge-132
shows antitumor activity in vitro only to HCT cell, and the inhibition yield is
31.4%.

3.3. 99mTc Labeling
Labeling yields of
compound 5 at different conditions are showed in . The compound shows
maximum labeling yield of above 90% at 1 mg of the germanium sesquioxide, pH 7.0 ∼ 8.0,
20°C, with 0.075~0.1 mg of SnCl2 as reducing agent for
more than 10 minutes of reaction.

3.4. Biodistribution
The result of the biodistribution study of compound 5
in nude mice is tabulated in . The uptakes of the compound in heart,
brain, and muscle are low. It shows high uptake in liver, kidney, and lung. The
lung has the highest uptake at 3-hour and 6-hour postinjection.

Tumor uptakes of compound 5 are 0.73, 0.97, 0.87, and 0.62
ID %/g at 1-hour, 3-hour, 6-hour, and 20-hour postinjection, respectively, which
are higher than those
of muscle, heart, and brain but lower than those of kidney, liver, and lung. The clearance of
the compound in tumor is relatively low (). At 20-hour postinjection,
the tumor uptake is higher than that of all other tissues except kidney, liver,
and lung. The maximum T/NT is the ratio of tumor to brain (18.30) and followed
by the ratio of tumor to muscle (5.81) at 20-hour postinjection. T/NT for tumor
versus blood increases with time with the maximum of 3.01 at 20-hour
postinjection (). The result of its relatively high tumor uptake and low
tumor clearance as well as its high tumor inhibition yield suggests that
compound 5 may be developed to be a suitable agent for cancer therapy.

4. Discussion
Mironov et
al. synthesized  bis (2-carboxyethylgermanium) sesquioxide (now known as Ge-132)
in the 1960s []. In the 1970s, Japanese scholar K. Asai.
synthesized organogermanium pharmaceuticals with wide spectra of
pharmacological activities, in which he found Ge-132 showing antitumor activity []. 
Since then, a lot of studies showed that many organogermanium compounds can modify
immune function, inhibit tumor cell proliferation [], induce tumor
cell apoptosis [], and they are efficient in treating and
preventing cancers [–]. Besides, they can also relieve cancer-induced
pain [], but the main problem of organogermanium compounds used as
antitumor agents is their low pharmacological effects, which makes them can
only be used as auxiliary agents in tumor therapy. So, development of more
effective antitumor organogermanium compounds is a valuable subject.

In this
study, five new organogermanium compounds were synthesized and characterized by
elemental analysis data and IR spectra. The elemental analysis data and IR
spectra were consistent with the expected structure of the compounds. In IR
spectra, the wide absorption band at 800~900 cm−1 of the
characteristic region of νGe–O
provides support for Ge–O network structure. The weak absorption peak at about
550 cm−1 corresponds to the characteristic region of νGe–C. The
result shows that Ge–O network structure and Ge–C bond exist in the compounds.

One of the
characteristics of germanium compounds is polymorphism []. The basic
formula of germanium sesquioxides is (GeR)2O3. So
germanium sesquioxides can be represented by [(GeR)2O3]n where R is the group conjugated with germanium atom and n is the degree
of polymerization. The degree of polymerization strongly influences the
toxicity of the compounds. It is reported that the value of “n” depends on the
way in which a solid product separates out of a solution of the compound. 
Particle size and bulk density of the dried solid in batch-to-batch comparisons
are notoriously variable. Although there may be many polymorphic solid forms,
the aqueous solutions, once they are formed, are identical []. In
this study, the “n” value of compound 5 in the mixture of DMSO and methanol was
detected. The result showed that the compound existed in dimer form in the
solution.

Two of the
five compounds showed certain antitumor activity at the concentration of 50 μg/mL. Compound
5 showed very high antitumor activity with the inhibition yields of 92.9%,
84.9%, and 70.9% to KB, HCT, and Bel cells at the concentration of 50 μg/mL (0.117 mmol/L),
respectively. Compound 4 showed antitumor activity only to HCT cell with the
inhibition yield of 41.5%. The antitumor activities of compound 4 and compound
5 were higher than that of Ge-132 which has been clinically used. But Ge-132
showed its in vivo antitumor effect partly due to its inducing the antitumor
immunity of the host. Whether the new organogermanium compounds synthesized
have the in vivo immunopotentiating activity needs to be further investigated.

Since many
organogermanium compounds have radiosensitive effect [], it is
expected that radiolabeled organogermanium compounds may be more effective in
the therapy of cancer by synergic effect of cytotoxicity of the compounds and
radiation effect. We investigated the method of labeling compound 5 with 99mTc. 
The result showed that the compound can be successfully labeled with labeling efficiency
greater than 90%. The therapeutic radionuclide, 186Re or 188Re,
has similar chemical property to 99mTc. So it is hopeful to label
the organogermanium compound with 186Re or 188Re for the
tumor therapy study. This work will be done later.

Labeling
compound 5 with 99mTc also allowed the biodistribution study of the
compound in nude mice bearing human colonic cancer. The biodistribution data showed
that the compound was mainly concentrated in kidney, lung, and next in liver. 
Tumor uptake was higher than that of muscle, heart, and brain, but lower than
that of kidney, liver, and lung after 3-hour postinjection. The clearance of
the compound in tumor was relatively low. The result showed that the compound
has relative high tumor uptake and low tumor clearance, which facilitates
using the compound in cancer therapy.

5. Conclusion
A new class of organogermanium sesquioxides was
synthesized and characterized. The antitumor activity, 99mTc labeling,
and biodistribution were studied. Of the five compounds, compound 5 shows
excellent antitumor activity, high tumor uptake, and slow clearance in tumor. 
It may be developed to be a suitable cancer therapeutic agent. The in vivo
antitumor effects of the organogermanium sesquioxides need to be further
investigated.
