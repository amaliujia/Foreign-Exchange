GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT
The octahedral complex [Ru(Hzcdta)CI2]'2H20 contains Ru(IV) surrounded by two nitrogen atoms, N(I)
and N(2), and two chloride ions c/s to each other, all in the equatorial plane. Two oxygen atoms, O(11) and
O(21) are located in trans axial octahedral positions. The complex shows remarkable in vitro and in vivo
activity against different carcinomas.

ABSTRACT
The highly water-soluble ruthenium complex [Ru(H2L)CI2]'2H20, in which H4L is the sequestering
ligand trans-l,2-cyclohexanediamminetetraacetic acid (cdta) has been synthesized, structurally characterized
and its properties studied. The X-ray crystallographic study shows that the chelating coordinated ligand is
tetradentate while the ruthenium environment is octahedral and slightly distorted, with two chloride anions
coordinated in cis positions. Potentiometric, conductimetric and infrared studies confirm the presence of two
free carboxylic groups, while electronic and voltammetric studies show that the central ion is Ru(IV). The
testing of the cytotoxic activity of this complex against three different human cancer cell lines indicates that
[Ru(H2L)CIz].2HzO shows a remarkable and selective antiproliferative effect against the human uterine neck
carcinoma HeLa and the malign adenocarcinoma ADLD, showing only a discrete turnout cell inhibition
activity against colon adenocarcinoma HT-29. The important antiprotiferative behaviour of complex
against the human adenocarcinoma ADLD, indicates that [Ru(HL)CI].2HzO might be considered as
potential antineoplastic compound.
INTRODUCTION
Metal-based antitumour drugs constitute in our days a broad research area of increasing interest/1-4/.
Concretely, cisplatin, cis-[Pt(NH3)2C12], carboplatin [cis-diammine-I, -cyclobutanedicarboxylato-
platinum(II)] and oxaliplatin [trans-(R,R)-l,2-diamminecyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum (II)], are currently being
used clinically /5-10/. However, the problem of both acquired and inherent resistance of tumour cells
presents a main limitation to the more widespread clinical use of platinum complexes/3,7,9/. In the hope of
overcoming these limitations, other platinum-based antitumour drugs have been synthesized and tested for
antitumour activity/11-15/. Furthermore, new anticancer drugs containing transition metal ions other than
platinum /16/have been also assayed. Possible advantages may involve different coordination geometries,
several metal-ion oxidation states and biological targets other than DNA.
In the design of these new drugs, ruthenium complexes have raised great interest/17-24/. As an example,
the antitumour activity of the highly water soluble complex H[Ru(H2L)CI]-4H20 (H4L: 1,2-
propylenediammine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, pdta) has been evaluated in vivo and in vitro/23,25/. This
complex rapidly binds to serum proteins producing stable adducts in which the core Ru(lII)(pdta) is probably
bound to histidines on the protein surface/26-28/. On the other hand, the complex damages nuclear DNA,
inhibits DNA recognition and stimulates NADPH oxidase and a respiratory burst in phagocytic neutrophils
and elicits phosphorylation oftyrosine residues/25,29/.
Another interesting ligand is the potential hexadentate sequestering agent trans-l,2-
cyclohexanediamminetetraacetic acid (cdta), in which the ethylenediammine group of edta has been replaced
by the heterocyclic moiety trans-l,2-cyclohexanediammine. The ligand cdta is widely used nowadays in
varied applications, i.e., as detoxifier of heavy metals that contaminate patients/30/, for use in endodontics
/31/, for extraction of pectin polymers /32/ and for separation and quantitation by several techniques of
276

inorganic ions and anionic metal complexes/33/. Although the metal complexes formed by cdta are known
from time ago/34/, recent literature has shown new synthesis procedures and important properties of new
isolated complexes. Concretely, those formed by cdta with Cu(ll) and Ni(ll) have been studied by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray crystal diffraction studies /35,36/ and interesting results on the
structure, electrochemistry, kinetics, pKa values and influence of chelate effects on the water-exchange
mechanisms of complexes cdta/Fe(lll)/Fe(ll)/ have been reported /37,38/. Research on the formation
constants and dissociation kinetic of cdta/lanthanide(lll)/ complexes /39,40/ as well as solution studies and
determination of the crystal structures of cdta complexes formed with the trivalent ions of AI, Ga, In and Sc
/41/have been also published.
The research developed so far on platinum-group metal complexes formed with cdta concerns first the the
X-ray crystallographic study of the diprotonated ligand and its complexes with [PdCI4]2-
and [PtCI4]2
salts
/42a/. Additionally, the reaction kinetic processes involved in the formation of Pd(ll) and Pt(ll) complexes of
different composition with amminepolycarboxylate ligands (i.e., {(H6L)[Pd/PtCI4]} or [Pd(H2L)]) were also
studied/42b/. Dinitrogen complexes formed between Ru(ll) and cdta were isolated and characterized/42c/.
On the other hand, promising results were obtained in the first study developed on the antitumour activity of
new Pd(ll)(cdta) complexes/42d/. Different Ru(lll) complexes such as [Ru(H4L)CI]3-n
and [Ru(HL)Ci]3"-I),
were synthesized and characterized by analytical and electrochemical techniques/43/. Finally, reduction of
molecular nitrogen to ammonia in aqueous solution under ambient conditions occurs in the presence of an
illuminated RuO2/Pt/CdS system; this reaction is catalysed by several Ru(ll) complexes as, for example,
[Ru(cdta)N]2-/44/.
As a result of the attractive research in progress on biological properties of complexes formed by Ru(lll)
with amminepolycarboxylic ligands, as well as the absence of structural and antitumour activity of Ru(cdta)
complexes, we present in this paper the synthesis, characterization by chemical and spectroscopic techniques,
x-ray crystal structure and biological behaviour of the water-soluble complex [Ru(HzL)CI].2H:O (I), in
which the ligand cdta (H4L) is acting as tetradentate molecule/45/. Our results demonstrate that the complex
contains Ru(IV) and shows activity against several in vitro and in vivo tumours. This research open a new
way for the medical and pharmaceutical development of potential antineoplastic complexes formed by the
chelating agent cdta with platinum metals.
EXPERIMENTAL
X-ray crystallography
A prismatic yellow-amber crystal of compound was mounted (glass fiber) on an Enraf Nonius CAD4
automatic diffractometer /46/ and 2388 unique reflections were measured. Cell constants and orientation
matrix for data collection were obtained by least-squares refinement of the 20 values of 25 reflections.
Intensities of 3123 reflections within the range 2 <20 <50 were measured and collected at 293 K using
monochromatic MoK, radiation (2 0.71073 A) and the a/20 scan technique. Intensities were corrected for
Lorentz and polarization effects/47/and 2388 {(1>2o->(I)} were considered as observed. A semiempirical

absorption correction (q-scans) was made/48/.
The structure was solved by the Patterson method/49/ and subsequent difference Fourier maps, and
refined on F by a full matrix least-squares procedure using anisotropic displacement parameters/50/. All
hydrogen atoms were located in difference map and included as fixed contributions riding on attached atoms
with isotropic thermal parameters 1.2 times those oftheir carrier.atoms. The H atoms oftwo water molecules,
O(1) and O(2), were not located. Therefore, the contribution of the density of a disordered water molecule
was subtracted from the measured structure factors with use of the SQUEEZE option /51/. Subsequent
refinement then converged with R factors and parameter errors significantly better than for all attempts to
model the solvent disorder. The Flack x parameter (absolute structure parameter) was calculated to be 0.05(6)
for the present structure and 0.95(6) for the inverted structure, thus providing strong evidence that the
absolute structure has been assigned correctly/52/. Criteria of a satisfactory complete analysis were the ratios
of rms shift to standard deviation less than 0.001 and no significant features in final difference maps. Atomic

/51/and SCHAKAL/54/.
Chemicals
Hydrated ruthenium (III) chloride (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and refluxed for 30 min. After
concentration to dryness, the compound was stored under CaCI_ (RuCI3). The ligand cdta was used as
purchased (Sigma). All other chemicals and solvents were analytical grade reagent products.
Analytical, potentiometric and conductimetric studies
Elemental microanalyses were performed at the Microanalytical Laboratory of the Barcelona University.
Metal content was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a Perkin Elmer 2380 model, at 10
mA and 349.9 rim. Hydration water molecules were determined by thermal analysis. Potentiometric and
conductimetric studies were carried out with a Crison MicroTT 2022 titrimeter, provided with autoburette
Microbur 2030. Aqueous solutions of the complex (50-100 mg/100 ml) were titrated against a 30 mM NaOH
solution. Electrical conductimetry ofthe same solution was performed on a Crison 525 conductimeter.
Electronic and infrared spectroscopy
The electronic spectra of solutions were recorded on a Jasco V550 spectrometer interfaced with a PC. IR
spectra were recorded on an FT-IR Jasco 300E instrument in the 200-4000 cm
-range, using either Nujol
mulls supported between polyethylene plates or KBr pellets.
Voltammmetric studies
Cyclic voitammetry measurements were carried out using a Princeton Applied Research analyser. A
278

glassy carbon electrode was used as working electrode on aqueous solutions (NaCIO4 0.15 M) of complex
at concentrations ranging between 1.0 and 6.0 mM. Potentials were measured against a saturated (NaC1)
calomel electrode (SCE) as reference electrode. Voltammograms (CV) were obtained at potential values
between +1.5 and -1.5 V. Scan rate was equal to 50 mV/s.
Biological in vitro and in vivo assays
Complex was dissolved in a mixed 1:1 DMSO:H20 solution and used as concentrated stock solution
from which diluted solutions (I/10 dilt/tion factor) were prepared and added to growing culture medium of
each one of the cellular types included in the study. The in vitro assays were done against three different
human cancer cell cultures: malignant melanoma (ADLD), uterine neck carcinoma (HeLa) and colon
adenocarcinoma (HT-29). For determination of plating efficiency and colorimetric reading, we prepared
plates of 24 and 96 wells, respectively, that were then inoculated with 5,000 to 30,000 cells/well. After 24 h
from the inoculation, different concentrations of the testing product were added to the cancer cells. After 48 h
of the named addition, the cells were washed and then fixed. Finally, the coloring and reading of the plates
were carried out. In all cases we determined the number of cells at the beginning (Tot), just before the
addition of the testing products (To) and 48 h later (T controls and T tests), according to Scheme 1.
The antitumour activity of was tested in vivo against Ehrlich ascitic tumour (EAT), the
intraperitoneally-implanted P388 lymphocytic leukemia and the subrenal capsule (transplanted human
mammary carcinoma) MX-I xenograft. The experiments were performed according to the NIH protocols at
ONI Centre, Madrid, Spain. CD2F female mice with weights within a 3 g value range and a minimum
weight of 18 g were used for all experiments except for MX-1 carcinoma, where athymic swiss mice were
used (4 g value range and weight of 17 g). The test groups was formed by 6 animals and control group by 12.
Synthesis of the complex [RuV(HL)CI].2HO [1]
Solid cdta (228 mg, 1.0 mmol) was added to a clear solution of RuCI3 (0.230 mg, 1.1 retool) dissolved in
a 50 ml of HCI 0.1 M, while stirring. The deep red mixture was introduced into a sealed pressure reactor and
heated for 16 h at 120C in electric oven. After cooling, the pink-red obtained solution was slowly
concentrated to about 5 ml by evaporation at room temperature. Yellow-amber prismatic crystals suitable for
X-ray diffraction studies were recovered and the solid analysed. Two hydration water molecules per mol of
compound were found by thermal analysis. Anal. (%), Calc. for C4H2008N2CI2Ru'2H20: C, 30.4; H, 4.5; N,

molecular structure obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis is shown in Fig. along with the numbering of
atoms in the molecule. The tetradentate chelating ligand (cdta) contains two free carboxylic groups and is
bonded to the central ion by two nitrogen atoms, N(l) and N(2), and two chloride anions cis to each other,
sharing the equatorial plane with the nitrogen atoms. The remaining coordination positions are occupied by
two oxygen atoms, O(11) and O(21), from coordinated carboxylate groups, situated in trans axial octahedral
positions that complete in this way the octahedral coordination sphere around ruthenium atom.

Table 2 presents selected bonds lengths and angles for complex 1. As expected, the chloride coordinated
ions are located much further from the ruthenium atom (2.37 A) than the two nitrogen atoms (2.11 / and
2.13 A). A possible explanation is related to the notable nucleophilic character of the chelating ligand that
induces a notable increasing of the distance Ru-CI. Furthermore, the bulky chelating ligand might be the
origin of the slight reduction observed in the CI-Ru-CI angle value (91.4), in comparison with the same
angle in cisplatin (91.9). These two effects have also been found in similar complexes with other
aminopolycarboxylic ligands, i.e., Ru(edta)CI2 [22] and Ru(pdta)Cb, [23].
Clearly, the distance Ru-O(I 1) is shorter (2.03 /) than the distance Ru-O(21) (2.07 /). As a
consequence, the octahedral configuration around ruthenium atom is slightly distorted (Fig. I) with angles

0(2 I)-Ru-N(2), 79.1.It is important to remark that the nonbonding CI...C1 distance (bite) in compound (3.35 A), is directly
correlated with the distance between adjacent or proximal coordination sites in biological targets such as
DNA. This bite distance is identical to that for cisplatin, and corresponds to the separation between two
appropriate DNA-nucleobase donor atoms, this fact enabling cross-linking formation after interaction of
complex with DNA inside the cell/29/.
in the packing, the molecules of complex are assembled in a 3D-network by intermolecular hydrogen
bonding that involves two pairs of oxygen atoms, O(13)...O(24), 2.65 /l and O(23)...O(14z), 2.67 A
(symmetry transformations; 1: x-y+1, x, z-l/6 and 2: y, -x+y+1, z+1/6), as found in similar cdta complexes
/42a/, i.e., the hydroxyl groups of the non-coordinated carboxylic moiety act as hydrogen-atom donors while
the carbonyl groups are the hydrogen-atom acceptors in these associations (Fig. 2). In addition, the two water
molecules located between neighbouring molecular units are also H-bonded to oxygen carboxylato groups
{O(1)...O(213), 2.89/l and O(2)...O(113), 2.87 A (symmetry transformations; 3: y, -x+y, z+l/6)}. This H-
bonded pattern can be described as a network of supramolecular helices. In the c direction the packing
generates a sixfold screw axis and parallel channels (Fig. 3), with cavities of radius 2.15 A. These channels
are hydrophilic because the oxygen atoms of carboxylic moieties and those of water molecules point towards
the cavities.

Potentiometric and conductimetric study
The potentiometric titration of an aqueous solution of the complex (Fig. 4a) shows a sharp increase of
pH for the consumption of 2 g-equiv, of alkali with an inflection point registered at pH 6.9. Furthermore, a
change in the electrical conductivity of the solution is also observed at A equal to 168 S cm (Figure 4b),

these facts indicating the simultaneous neutralization of two free-COOH groups of the same strength. These
results supported the tetradentate character for the cdta, which contains two coordinated carboxylate moieties
and two free carboxylic groups. Molecular weight deduced from the titration corresponds closely with the
expected for the dehydrated complex (MW: 516).
Ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy
In the electronic spectrum (not shown) three different absorptions bands at 28410 cm1
(352 nm;
11310 dm mol cm), 31056 cm (322 nm; 15600 dm mol cm) and 35336 cm (283 rim; 4070
dm tool
-cm) are observed. The first two main bands could be attributed to the electronic transitions 2Eg
--3Tlg and 3T2g 3T
-- g, respectively, while the smaller band (shoulder) registered at 283 nm could be due to the
transition 3Ag *-- Tg. This behaviour suggests a low spin d system, normally presenting two close bands of
similar intensities originated by transitions from unpaired basal states.
Infrared spectroscopy
The FT-infrared spectrum of compound 1 (not shown) presents a broad, split signal with main peaks at
2940 cm and 2902 cm1
corresponding to the symmetric stretching vibrations (vs) of the methylene groups
(C-H bonds) contained in the heterocyclic ligand and of the same groups next to coordinated and free
carboxylic groups. The O-H stretching vibrations of the free COOH groups are responsible for the broad
absorptions registered between 3350 cm and 2600 cm.The complex shows strong characteristic bands
registered at 1735 cm (vas, C=O bond of free carboxylic groups) and 1610 cm (Vas COO- coordinated
carboxylate groups) whereas the Vs of coordinated carboxylate groups appeared at 1400 cm-.The difference
of 210 cm between v, and vs of coordinated carboxylate groups indicates the predominantly ionic character
of complex 1.

the infrared spectrum of complex I.
Cyclic voltammetry
The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of just prepared 4.0 mM aqueous solutions (pH 2.0) of complex
(NaCIO, 0.15 M) is presented in Fig. 5. At electric potentials between +0.5 V and -0.5 V, the CV show a
cathodic wave (A) immediately followed by the anodic wave (A'), both clearly constituting a coupled pair,
AA'. If the potential varies between +1.5 V and -1.5 V, an intense cathodic peak is observed at about- 0.8 V,
while an anodic prominent peak appears at about 1.0 V. These features could be attributed to redox processes
affecting the ligands/58/.

always preceded by another less intense pair (BB', Ef 50 mV ) coupled with a reversible third pair CC' at
positive potential values (i.e., Ef-- + 535 mV; see Fig.5). Different coexisting Ru(lll) species seem to be
responsible for the processes AA' and BB', as suggested by the invariance of the used scanning speed
interval. However, the process BB' is the origin of the coupled process CC' (initial scanning in anodic
direction), the last probably due to the oxidation Ru(IIi)-Ru(IV). In fact, two reversible/quasi-reversible
couples at 0.25 V and 0.54 V are observed, characteristic of the one-electron reduction processes
Ru(lll)/Ru(ll) and Ru(IV)/Ru(III), respectively, in agreement with previous structural results shown in this
research.

(control curve) or presence of increased amounts of the tested compound (curves a and b). After three days
of treatment, a ruthenium complex dose of 25.4 tM (curve a) slowed cell proliferation in about 27% if
compared with control and this cell inhibition keeps constant during the remaining days of treatment. If the
dose is increased to 40.8 tM, the antiproliferative activity of complex is significantly enhanced not only on
the third day of treatment (47% of inhibition) but also during the three following days (curve b; i.e., 55% at
fourth day), as manifested by the smooth ascendant slope of the curve at this drug concentration. These
results show that [Ru(H2L)CIz].2HO is remarkably cytotoxic against HeLa human cells at dose of40.8 tM.

Fig. 6: Antiproliferative effects exerted by the [Ru(H2L)CI2]-2H20 complex on the grow kinetics of the
human uterine neck carcinoma HeLa. Cells were exposed to several doses of the ruthenium complex
for a total of five days, as indicated: control curve (untreated HeLa cells); curve a (25.4 IaM); curve
b (40.8 luM).
To determine if this cytotoxic behaviour holds true for other human tumours, the inhibition assay was
repeated against the human malign melanoma ADLD (Fig. 7) whose proliferation rate (control curve) is
higher than that observed for HeLa cells. A substantial increase of the antiproliferative properties was
detected against this melanoma at the same doses assayed against HeLa carcinoma. At a dose of 25.4 IuM,
(curve a) the inhibition of ADLD cells is not only more important that in the previous assays but increases
with increasing time (inhibition of about 33% after 72 h; 42.4% on the fourth day, and 46.4% on the last
day). If the dose is increased (40.8 M) the same general pattern is observed (increasing cytotoxicity at
increasing time) and the complex shows important antiproliferative response next to 70% during the last
two days oftreatment (curve b).
Fig. 8 shows the antiproliferative behaviour of complex against the colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-
29. As can be seen, the cell growth observed in this culture (control curve) is slightly slower than HeLa cell
culture while the cytotoxic study indicates that ruthenium complex exhibits discrete cell inhibition activity at
both doses assayed. The analysis of the antiproliferative curve at the low dose (25.4 IuM, curve a) shows that
ruthenium complex behaves in a similar way to that analyzed for HeLa cells (the inhibition remains constant
after three days of treatment), but the antiproliferative activity decreased to about 20%, if compared to that
observed at this dose for HeLa cells (27%). When the dose is increased (40.8 IuM, curve b), the observed cell
inhibition after 72 h of treatment is enhanced to 25%. Interestingly, this inhibition also remains constant
during the treatment.

()./'the Complex
The in vivo antitumour activity of complex against EAT and P388 tumours was evaluated at several
treatment doses in the range 20--240 mg/kg body weight. The therapeutic activity of the complex was
obtained from the T/C percentage which is described as T/C% (100) x mean life span oftreated mice/mean
life span of untreated mice; turnout free survivors were excluded. The minimum value of T/C for moderate
activity is 120 (EAT and P388 tumours); if T/C > 125 the complex is considered a candidate for further
antitumour assays. T/C values required for activity in MX-1 xenograft tumour must be lower than 20 (T/C
<20).
For EAT, a T/C (%) of 350 was obtained (25 mg/kg) and the complete remission of the turnout observed
at a dose of 50 mg/kg. The toxic .dose (LDs0) was equal to 100 mg/kg. In the case of the lymphocytic
leukemia P388, a T/C(%) value of 140 was obtained (60-120 mg/kg) while in MX-I xenograft carcinoma,
this parameter was equal to 16 at a dose of240 mg/kg.
These results evidence a notable and specific antiproliferative effect of complex [Ru(HzL)CI2]'2H20
against the human tumour cell lines ADLD and HeLa, with selective and important cytotoxic properties in
both cases. The in vivo antitumour activity is also remarkable in the studied turnouts. A further investigation
ofthe antineoplastic activity ofthis new potential ruthenium drug against other types ofturnout is advisable.
