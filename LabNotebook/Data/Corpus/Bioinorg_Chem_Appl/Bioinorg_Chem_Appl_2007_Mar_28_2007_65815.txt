1. INTRODUCTION
Molecules react chemically in specific and
selective ways to form the basis of the living world. Taking cue
from this, chemists have shifted their focus from molecular
chemistry (chemistry of covalent bonds) to supramolecular
chemistry (chemistry of noncovalent interactions) with the
supramolecular architecture being constructed either through
self-assembly of subunits or by selective host-guest interactions.
In self-assembly, particles assemble into atoms, atoms assemble
into molecules, and these molecules react with one another to
reassemble into new molecules. The molecules assemble with
themselves and with other molecules via intermolecular noncovalent
bonds to form supramolecular arrays or assemblies 
[]. The
structural integrity of the final architecture is preserved by
noncovalent interactions. The most effective example of
self-assembly occurring in living systems is virus, the mechanism
of which has been studied in detail. Inspired by the nature's ways
of constructing and functioning, the synthetic chemists had the
most logical choice of creating supramolecular assemblies via
self-assembly. Before the accidental discovery of crown ethers
[] by Pedersen, the word supramolecule was not commonly
used; but along with cyclodextrins [] 
the crown ethers were
also included as another example of host-guest interactions. Later
came the discovery of calixarenes [], 
which became the third
generation of supramolecules. All coexist under the title of
supramolecules as well as host-guest chemistry.

Since there is no clear demarcation between host-guest and
supramolecule, it is indeed not always possible to differentiate
the two, however, molecular recognition is a cornerstone of both
these facts. Since the attention is on molecules having molecular
cavities which will act as building blocks for the compounds to
mimic natural molecular recognition processes, calix[n]arenes
serve as a good example of study in supramolecular chemistry. As
already mentioned above, calixarenes are a widely recognized and
researched topic in supramolecular chemistry. There were and there
are still a good number of research groups whose work has already
generated hundreds of original journal articles, extensive
literature reviews [–] and monographs [].

1.1. Calixarenes: their origin and synthesis
In 1872, Adolf von Baeyer heated aqueous formaldehyde with phenol
to give a hard resinous product. Three decades later, in
1905–1909, Leo Baekland devised a process and he marketed the
strong resin obtained from phenol-formaldehyde, under the name
Bakelite. Alois Zinke, a new entrant in this field explored the
different possibilities of reacting various p-alkyl phenols with
aqueous formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide, and assigned the
products of the treatment as cyclic tetrameric structures calling
them “mehrkernmethylenephenolvorbindungen.” 
These compounds were classed as [1n]metacyclophanes 
(where n is the number of benzene rings)
().

Although worked upon by many, the credit of naming this class goes
to C. D. Gutsche who perceives a similarity between the shapes of
these cyclic tetramers and a type of Greek vase known as calix
crater (); they suggested the compound to be called “Calixarenes.”

Calixarenes are a class of cyclooligomers formed after
phenol-formaldehyde condensation, with defined upper and
lower rims and a central annulus ().

Thus originated a category of compounds derived from
p-tert-butyl phenol and it was designated as p-tert-butyl
calix[n]arene. After Zinke reported that p-methyl,
p-tert-butyl, p-amyl, p-octyl, p-cyclo-hexyl, p-benzyl
(), and p-phenyl phenol condense with
formaldehyde to yield high melting materials, all of which the
group assumed to be cyclic tetramers, it was later extensively
characterized by Kammerer and the interpretation was subsequently
invalidated.

The same group modified the 10-step procedure of synthesizing
calixarene from p-cresol of Hayes and Hunter
().

Due to the presence of their preformed cavities, the calixarenes
are able to act as host molecules. Due to such structural
elaboration, the calixarenes lend themselves well to many
applications. This “crater” or “basket” 
plays a very important
role in shaping the entire architecture of calixarene for its
function in host-guest chemistry, since this theory is highly
interdependent on two terms: “shape” and 
“functionality.” One
of the most interesting and fascinating aspects of calixarenes
lies in the fact that they can assume different forms due to the
flexibility in the rotation of
Ar−CH2−Ar bonds, 
and hence came into
existence the “cone,” “partial cone,” “1,2-alternate,” 
and “1,3-alternate” conformations 
(), which were
earlier suggested by Cornforth and later designated by Gutsche
[]. Calix[6]arenes can exist in eight different “up-down” conformations like calix[4]arenes[5], wherein cone conformation is the most stable conformation amongst all the forms of
calix[n]arenes.

A series of books and reviews have been published which discuss in
length the calixarenes and its substituted derivatives being used
for the recognition of cation, anion neutral molecules, and
organic moieties [–]. The literature survey reveals that 
plenty of work has been done in synthesizing
upper-rim modified calixarenes. Comparatively less work has been
done at the lower rim of calixarenes. The focus of modifying the
calixarenes was much concentrated on the upper rim, due to the
easy removal of t-butyl group that facilitated different
substituted calixarenes [, 
] 
with many applications.

2. STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS
2.1. Upper-rim modification of calix[n]arenes and their potential applications
Easy removal of the t-butyl group facilitates in the formation
of diverse ranges of upper-rim functionalized
calix[n]arenes. One of the most common features observed in
almost every research work is the extended application of
calixarene for the study of metal calixarene complexation
behavior. Different substituents tend to influence the
complexation behavior of the entire calixarene architecture. The
bithiophene groups substituted at the upper rim gave rise to a
host-guest complex of tungsten oxo calixarene complex 
[].
Interaction of 4-sulfonic calix[n]arenes with niclosamide was
investigated, which is a relatively new work in calixarenes-drug
chemistry. The 4-sulfonic calix[8]arenes improved the solubility
of the niclosamide the most, compared to -[4]arenes and
-[6]arenes. The complex formed could be due to hydrogen bonding,
hydrophobic bonding, and also possibly due to the electron
donor-acceptor interactions [] 
().

Another 4-sulfonic calix[n]arene interaction with neutral
molecule like furosemide has been observed. The molecular size of
4-sulfonic calix[6]arene influenced the increase in the solubility
of the furosemide the most with the presence of noncovalent
interaction behavior []. 
Napthalimido group introduced at the upper rim of calixarenes in varying 
proportions and a molecular capsule of two calixarenes is formed via
perylene-bisimide spacer, the compound is used for UV and
fluorescence studies []. 
An Rh–Rh unit formed an
intermolecular link between two calix[4]arenes macrocycles and
served as a ligand for transition metal catalysts
[] 
().

Two pyridyl groups were linked via amide linkage at the upper rim
and the calix[4]arene bispyridyl amides forming
complexes with aromatic and alkyl dicarboxylic acids 
[]. Diphenyl phosphino groups 
were attached at the upper rim of calix[4]arenes forming an organometallic 
ruthenium complex []. 
4-hydroxybenzyl groups introduced at the upper rim of the calix[4]arene 
acted as anion binding groups []. Studies
have revealed that the complexation of transition metals, like
heavy metals, is most certainly favored by the incorporation of
“softer” donor atoms such as nitrogen (as the amine), sulfur or
phosphorus. A recent study of thiazolazo groups introduced at all
the four positions of calix[4]arene was used to study for its
recognition of heavy metal ions 
[, 
]. Calix-O-glycosides
were synthesized by multiple glycosylations of upper rim
of calix[4]arene polyols []. These calyx sugars were
successfully prepared by stereo selectively substituting at the
upper rim with glycol ().

Heterocyclylmethanamines attached at the upper rim of calix[4]arene 
() acted as a potential ligand
for synthetic modeling of multinuclear metalloenzymes 
[].

Semicarbazone was attached at two positions of the upper
rim of calix[4]arene and fixed on a resin and studied for its
sorption and separation studies of La(III), 
Ce(III),
Th(IV), and U(VI) []. Isocyanide groups
introduced at the upper rim of calix[4]arene was studied for its
complexation with gold []. Adamantyl group introduced at
the upper rim of calix[4]arenes gave rise to adamantyl calixarene
[].

2.2. Lower-rim modification of calix[n]arenes
The lower rim of calixarenes is less subjected to modification,
but the applications of calixarenes substituted at the lower rim
are far greater than substituted at the upper rim. Due to the
expansion of the cavity after substitution, the lower rim can
facilitate the complexation with bigger moieties like heavy metals
and also organic molecules. The research put forth over here shows
that after the structural modification of calix[n]arene, easy
encapsulation of drugs, organic molecules as well as heavy metals
is observed. Hence the phenolic hydroxyl groups at the lower rim
of the calixarenes represent an excellent reactive function for
the introduction of groups, which modify the shape, and the
complexing properties of these molecules. Preliminary work on the
lower rim of calixarenes has been started with alkylation and
acylation reactions, which have been reviewed extensively in books
[, , 
] and review articles 
[–]. Different lower-rim modifications can be done as follows.

2.2.1. Esterification
Esterification reactions on the lower rim of calix[n]arene have
been the earliest reported work. The acylation and aroylation
generally involve all the OH groups, a minor
change in reaction conditions can change the outcome of the
reaction. An excess or less amount of aroylating/acylating agent,
the equivalents of reactants, the base, the solvent all contribute
to the conformation of calix[n]arene (where n = 4/6). The main focus of aroylation has been with benzoyl chloride, p-nitro
benzoyl chloride and 3,5-di nitro benzoyl chloride; although a
number of other reagents are used for the synthesis of calixarene
esters. Calixarene glycine ester acetamides have been synthesized
from acetyl chlorides and glycine ethyl ester [].
Esterification has also been reported for calix[8]arene where
reaction of p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene with di-ethyl
dibromomalonate gave the tetra ester derivative with a cone
conformation []. O-acylated derivative of octa-tert-butyl
calix[8]arene was prepared in high yields, by treating with
dimethylacetamide in presence of acetic anhydride to give 95.4%
octa-O-acetyl-octa(tert-butyl)calix[8]arene [].
O-substituted calix[8]arenes were also prepared using allyl
bromide in presence of pottassium hydroxide and polyethylene
glycol di-ether in toluene to give its corresponding derivative
[].

2.2.2. Etherification
Alkylation has been studied in considerable detail in
calix[4]arene series, and methods have been devised for preparing
 the mono, 1,2-di, 1,3-di,
tri, and tetra ethers. Monoethers can be prepared in
moderate-to-good yields by direct alkylation using an alkylating
agent with sodium hydride as the base in toluene solution
[], barium hydroxide as the base in DMF solution [] 
or 1.2 equivelent of a weak
base and an excess of alkylating agent RX was used, where R
includes methyl, ethyl, allyl or ethoxy carbonylmethyl [].
Monobenzylation of 1,3-p-dinitrocalix[4]arene, with aluminum
trichloride as the catalyst yielded its respective derivatives,
the aroylation occurring preferentially on the aryl residues not
containing the p-nitro groups []. It is observed that
distal dialkylation leading to 1,3-diethers is generally much more
easily achieved than proximal dialylation leading to 1,2-diethers.
Under conditions similar to those leading to monoethers, but with
an excess of the alkylating agent, 1,3-diethers were produced,
often in very high yields; as, for example, 1,10-phenanthroline
was used as a spacer to link intramolecularly and this derivative
of -calix[6]arene was found to complex with Cu [] 
().

Trimethylation of the parent calix[4]arene was accomplished with
dimethylsulphate in DMF in the presence of BaO · Ba(OH)2 []. Higher yields of triether, however, can be obtained when the starting material is already partially
alkylated. Another approach to the triether as well as the mono-
and diethers involved protection-deprotection sequences []. Tetraalkylation of calix[4]arenes is generally carried out with an
excess of the alkylating agent in the presence of the strong-base
sodium hydride, although in some instances the much weaker-base
potassium carbonate is also used.

The first instance of alkylation of the sulfide bridge was
achieved by the cyclocalkylation of p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene
and p-tert-butylthiacalix[4]arene with various aliphatic
glycols. This intrabridging of the calix[4]arene afforded 1,2- and
1,3-bridged calixarenes with O, S-cyclization, which caused the
formation of sulfonium phenoxide betaines as shown in [] ().

New borono alkoxy calix[4]arenes were synthesized by alkylation,
allylation, and hydroboration and this significantly gave rise to
boronoalkoxycalix[4]arenes with 1,3-bridged structure which could
coordinate significantly with monosaccarides [].
p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene was reacted with p- and m-benzyl bromides in the presence of alkali metal carbonates, and
silylation of these derivatives gave their respective derivatives
[]. A series of six calix[4]arene derivatives bearing allyl groups and/or benzyl groups have been functionalized at the
phenolic oxygen atoms []. 
p-t-butylcalix[4]arene
diamides were synthesized in a stepwise method where it was first
reacted with ethylbromoacetate, then the hydrolysis was followed
by the conversion to acid chloride and amidation 
[].

Regioselective synthesis of monoalkylethers of p-tert-butyl
calix[6]arene in good yield was achieved with a variety of
electrophiles using 2,2 equivelent, of pottassium carbonate as
base in acetonitrile under ultrasonic irradiation at ambient
temperature []. 
The first example of selectively functionalized calix[7]arenes has been 
obtained by weak-base promoted O-alkylation or O-benzoylation of
p-tert-butylcalix[7]arene. Mono, 1,3- and 1,4-disubstituted
calix[7]arenes have been obtained in workable yields, while the
1,2,4,6-tetra substitution was achieved with surprisingly high
selectivity by 50–88% yield by using pottassium 
carbonate as the base [] 
().

The calix[8]arenes present an interesting case where in addition
to the fully O-substituted calix[8]arenes, which was obtained by
treatment with strong bases and a large excess of derivatizing
agent [], twenty eight partially alkylated calix[8]arenes were also obtained. Neri and coworkers have reported the first
success in selective lower-rim substitution and provided details
for the preparation of 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-arylmethyl ether of
tert-butyl-calix[8]arene obtainable in yields of 20–41% using
potassium carbonate as the base []. 
The direct methylation was studied in considerable detail, 
and procedures were worked out for generating some of the partially 
methylated compounds in isolable yields 
[].

Alkylation with aryl methyl halides containing hetero atoms
provided still another route for the introduction of functional
groups onto the lower rim []. 
Methylthioethoxy and pyridyl 2 methyl oxy groups were introduced at 
the lower rim of calix[4]arene to give rise to bis derivatives of 
both types 1 and 2 [] 
().

Polysiloxane derivatives of calix[4]arene were prepared in
presence of chloroplatinic acid []. 
Proximal O,O′ capped
calix[4]arenes with a disiloxane bridge is synthesized using
cesium carbonate as the base in THF, also providing an alternative
of desilylation and thereafter alkylation using benzyl bromide
with potassium tert-butoxide as a base to give rise to
unsymmetrical calix[4]arenas []. 
An ether-amide linkage was synthesized using 2-diethylcarbamoylmethoxyethoxy 
group at the lower rim of t-butyl-calix[4]arene [] 
().

Calix[4]arene containing pyridinyl moiety was synthesized forming
a tetraether derivative []. 
Selective 2,2′-bpyridine
units at 1,3 position and two benzyl units at 2,5 positions at the
lower rim of calix[4]arene was prepared 
[] as in
().

A new family of calix[4]arene was prepared by the incorporation of
2,2′-bithiazole units []. 
Water soluble calix[4]arene incorporating both sulfonate groups at its upper rim and
2,2′-bipyridine groups at its lower rim was also prepared
[]. Etherification in 1,3-alternate 
conformation was carried out on calix[4]arene using R = 2-MeOC6H4OCH2CH2 with considerable good yields [].

Schiff-base derivatives were synthesized using the amino ethoxy
derivatives of calix[4]arene with the aromatic aldehydes in high
yields []. Copolyethers and polyurethanes containing lower-
and upper-rim calix[4]arene units in the fixed cone conformation
were prepared by reacting the bisphenol with the distal
calix[4]arene diols [].

2.2.3. Bridged calix[n]arenes
The first synthesized lower-rim 1,3 ring bridged calixarene is the
calix[4]arenecrown [] 
in early 1980s and now represented by dozens of examples 
[, , 
]. 
The parent calixcrowns as well as their dimethyl ethers retain some conformational flexibility
and can exist in cone, partial cone, and 1,3-alternate
conformations, but ethers with larger groups such as isopropyl and
benzyl have fixed cone conformations. There is also the report of
the dialkylation of calix[4]arene capped by diamide bridges which
gave rise to fully substituted compounds of 1,3-alternate
conformation The diesters were then cyclized with diamines to
afford doubly capped derivatives 
[]. Other crown ether-type
bridges have been synthesized [] 
like the aza crowns [], 
the bipyridyls [], 
and a variety of aza
crown-type structures. Another type of 1,3-bridged calix[4]arene
including those with a double bond in the bridge have been
prepared by the ruthenium-catalyzed coupling of the 1,3-bisbutenyl
ether []. Only a few examples of calixcrowns of the larger
calixarenes have been reported. New borono alkoxy calix[4]arenes
were synthesized by alkylation, allylation, hydroboration, and
significantly gave rise to boronoalkoxycalix[4]arenes with
1,3-bridged structure which could coordinate significantly with
monosaccarides []. Calix[4]arene dibenzo crown ether has been prepared in 1,3-alternate conformation using R = C1–C40
n-alkyl chains [].

Azo benzene derivatized crown p-tert-butyl calix[4]arene was synthesized in a stepwise method and a 1,3-bridged structure was
formed []. Crown ethers derived from bicyclocalix[4]arenes in which the opposite phenolic units are connected by a poly
oxyethylene bridge at the lower rim and a 2,6-di
methyllene-4-nitrophenol bridge at the upper rim were reported
[]. These derivatives were found to be potential ligands for the complexation of potassium and cesium. Calix[4]arene
derivative containing pyridyl methoxy group at its lower rim has
been synthesized using potassium carbonate and sodium iodide
[]. The spanning of t-Bu-calix[5]arene has been accomplished with tetraethyleneyethoxy and pentaethyleneoxy chains joining the 1,3 rings and with hexaethyleneoxy chains joining the
1,3 rings []. Tri-O-substituted 1,3-bridged
calix[5]arene-crown-6ethers bearing alkyl, arylalkyl, alkoxyalkyl,
and alkoxycarbonylmethyl residues were attached at the lower rim
of the calix[5]arene with cone conformations although they
possess a bulky structure [] ().

The first C3v-symmetrical calix[6](aza)crown has been obtained in five-step synthesis procedure to give a cone
conformation and prevent a ring inversion [] 
(). Diester intrabridging of p-tert-butyl calix[8]arene was afforded using spanner adipoyl chloride in the
presence of sodium hydride as the base and hence yielded singly
and doubly intrabridged esters; xantheno calix[8]arenes were also
obtained in the course of the rearrangement of the intermediate
product [].

Examples of porphyrins quadruply attached to the lower rim of
calixarene have been reported []. p-tert-butyl calix[4]arenes with diester bridge spanning the 1,3-distal
positions on the lower rim were prepared by cyclocondensation of
polyethylene glycol bis bromo acetates with ter-butylcalix[4]arene
[] ().

One of the few lower-rim-spanned calix[5]arenes that has been
reported is the 1,3-di-ester obtained in low yield from
p-tert-butyl calix[5]arene and o-pthaloyl chloride [] 
but considerable attention has been devoted to bridge the lower
rim of calix[6]arenes with spanners other than polyethyleneoxy. An
m-xylene bridged calix[6]arene has been synthesized with the
other positions being functionalized by methoxy groups []. It has been observed that for big spanners, the calix[6]arene is
conformationally inflexible and retains its cone structure.

Calix[8]arenes have been quadruply-spanned by a durylene moiety to
give a structure that has fixed pseudopleated loop conformation
[], a potential moiety for the complexation of different metal ions []. Biscrowned calix[8]arenes were synthesized
by alkylating p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene or calix-[8]monocrowns
with diethylene glycol tosylate [] ()
triethylene glycol ditosylate, in the presence of various bases
where 22 possible isomers were isolated in varying yields.

Bis-calixarenes connected by four tetraalkyltetra(tosyl-oxyethoxy)
groups have been reported called as calixtubes, in high yields in
71% yield. These molecules proved highly selective for
complexation of potassium over other I-group cations and barium
[] 
(). Calix[4]crown diacylamides with
two acetaminoanthraquinone units at the lower rim have been
reported [].

3. APPLICATIONS
The spurt in the increase of literature regarding calixarenes in
the last 25 years can be ascribed to the growing interest in
introducing different functional groups via different synthetic
procedures. But also the major factor that has contributed for the
proliferation of these research papers is the tailor-made
structure of calixarenes for its use as complexing agents, for it
is this possibility and its potential that has brought for
calixarenes this recognition that they enjoy today. The use of
these modified calixarenes as sensors for metal ion,
organic/neutral molecules, and drugs recognition has brought
calixarenes to limelight. They have become a wonder molecule at
the hands of a chemist. This wonder molecule has its roots in
host-guest chemistry.

During the molecular evolution of biological system, the highly
selective complexation process between the host and the guest must
have played a central role; this attribute of biological life was
mimicked in synthetic chemistry which later came to be known as
the host-guest chemistry. A molecular complex is composed of at
least one host and one guest components. The host is an
organic molecule or ion whose binding sites converge. The guest is
an organic molecule or ion or metal ion whose binding sites
diverge []. 
The complexes of the host-guest chemistry are
held together in unique structural relationship by forces other
than those of covalent nature. They can be pole-pole, pole-dipole
or dipole-dipole variety, more specifically, the components of
complex are bound together by hydrogen bond, by ion-pair, by
π-π stacking interactions, 
and by van-der Waals forces [, 
]. 
There are a number of ways by which the complexation
phenomena could be studied. In addition to the powerful
spectrophotometric methods now available, most often NMR and/or
UV-Vis spectrometry and various other techniques like mass
spectrometry are also being used []. 
The precise structures
of complexes are most directly obtained by X-ray crystallography,
and the reasonable assumption is generally made that the solid
structure architecture is similar to the solution state. The
ability in terms of sensitivity and the selectivity of the
calixarene as a host to discriminate among a group of guests makes
it a special class of subject in supramolecular chemistry.

3.1. Lower-rim esters
Much more effective than the simple ethers, the esters have been
extensively studied. The earliest to be studied among this family
of compounds were esters for which it was determined, using phase
transfer extraction measurements, that the cyclic tetramers,
pentamers, and hexamers extract all of the alkali cations, the
cyclic tetramer works best with 
Na+, 
the cyclic pentamer better with 
K+, 
Rb+, 
and Cs+, and
the cyclic hexamer best with Rb+ 
and Cs+ but
very poorly with Na+, 
and the cyclic heptamer and octamer are quite ineffective 
[].

McKervey, Diamond, and Svehla continued to publish on the use of
calixarenes esters as electrochemical sensors. The calix[4]arene
tetra ethyl ester synthesized by this group continues to be
commercially available as sodium selective electrode and is
commonly used in hospitals for measuring sodium in blood. This
group has also showed the calixarenes could produce electrodes
selective for potassium and cesium 
[]. Ester derivatives,
the synthesis of which can be achieved smoothly, binds amines,
with a preference for shorter amines 
[].

The ligand discriminates according to guest hydrophobicity and
shows selectivity for phenylalanine and tyrosine esters over
glycine, alanine and 4-aminobutyric acid, with the interaction
primarily taking place due to tripodal hydrogen bonding. Ammonium
and alkylammonium ions can be sensed by calixarenes where
diquinone is part of the macrocycle together with ligating sites
such as ester or amide for hydrogen bonding 
[, 
].

3.2. Lower-rim ethers, ketones, amides,
and carboxylic acids
Lower-rim ethers and their counterparts, ketones, amides, and
carboxylic acids have good complexing properties. The earliest
examples of lower-rim-substituted calixarenes investigated for
their complexation properties are the ethyleneoxy compounds
[, 
] 
which show only a modest degree of cation binding
agency. As it is the case for crown ethers, calixarenes with
oxygen donor atoms turned out to be suitable for selectively
binding alkali ions. The ligands are more hydrophobic compared
with crown ethers and the membranes therefore are more stable.
Nitrophenol or azophenol moieties on calix[4]arenes equipped with
additional ester groups [] 
transform the Li/Na 
selectivity in organic solutions into a
bathochromic shift from 350 to 425 nm with the help of an
auxillary base to support the deprotonation. The calixarene with a
nitrophenylazophenyl group is rather versatile. It not only
detects lithium ions in the presence of weak base, but also in
turn detects weak bases such as volatile amines when
Li+ is already present in the 
membrane [, 
] 
().

Ketones have complexing features [] 
similar to those of the esters previously described. Stability constant measurements and
extraction data indicate that the cyclic tetrameric ketones are
better than their ester analogs for the extraction of
Li+ and also for 
Rb+ and 
Cs+. The
ketone has a broader range of extraction capability than its
cyclic tetramer and hexamer counterparts but shows little
selectivity among the cations.

Amides were first prepared and studied by Ungaro et al. 
[] 
and subsequently in considerable detail by Mckervey et
al. [, ] and Beer et al. [–] (). 
As against the ethers, esters, and ketones, the amides very effectively 
complex alkaline earth
cations []. 
In extraction studies the cyclic tetramers are
shown to prefer Eu+3 
over Pr+3 and
Yb+3, 
with Eu+3 
the cyclic hexamers being better than the cyclic tetramers showing the
highest extraction effectiveness [].

Trivalent cations are also effectively bound by the amides
[] like 
Pr+3, 
Eu+3, and 
Yb+3.
The amides prove to be superior to the esters and ketones for
complexing Ag+ 
[] and within the amide series the
cyclic pentamer is an especially strong complexing agent. The
larger Tl+ cation forms weaker complexes than
Ag+. Among the ester, acid, or amide groups anchored to
calixarenes, the latter turned out to form most stable complexes
with alkaline earth due to the high carbonyl group polarity
[].

With phoshphine oxide groups appended to the lower rim,
in good Ca+2/
Na+ selectivity and membrane durability
is achieved in ISEs. Expanding the calix[n]arene
cavity from n = 4 over 5 to 6 changes the 
Sr/Na
selectivity of the amide derivatives from 0.09 to 2.8 to 760 in
extraction which further improves with alkyl ether instead of
t-butyl groups in 4-position of the phenyl groups 
[].
Amide derivatives of calixarenes have also been used for
Sr+2 
separation in synergistic mixtures with hydrophobic
anion [, 
] 
which should work in ISE membranes as well.

Carboxylic acids differ from the esters, ketones, and amides in
having ionizable groups. The carboxylic acids are all more
effective complexing agents for alkali cations than the
corresponding esters, ketones, and amides. Although the calixarene
carboxylic acids form complexes with some of the alkali metal
cations, [] 
the fact that they have an even greater
capacity for alkaline earth cations was first realized in the mid
1980s [] 
and subsequently studied in some detail. The acids
form stronger complexes with lanthanide cations like
Pr+3, 
Eu+3, 
and Yb+3 than with
alkali and alkaline earth cations. The calix[4]arene dicarboxylic
acid and calix[6]arene ester are useful for the extraction of the
rare earths [, 
] 
().

Some of the carboxylic acids have proved to be highly effective
complexation agents for the uranyl cation []. The analogous p-tert-butylcalix[5]arene and -[6]arenes are somewhat
less effective uranophiles, but the corresponding hydroxamic acids
(n = 6) is even better and also competes with CO3−2 ions [–].

3.3. Lower-rim nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus 
containing groups
The McKervey group introduced tetrameric calixarenes where
nitrogen and sulfur were used in the coordination center and they
were found to be selective for soft heavy metal ions such as
silver []. 
Electrodes based on the hexamer derivative of the
phoshphine oxide series of derivatives were found to have
excellent selectivity for lead ions [] 
().

Thioester groups in calix[4]arenes lower the
selectivity over sodium ions to some extent due to their carbonyl
oxygens. Thiocarbamoyl groups or dithiocarbamoyl groups attached
to the calixarene skeleton (Figures  and
) 
provide selectivity for Ag+, 
Pd+2, 
Hg+2 
and other soft metal ions over hard ones 
[, 
].

A class of hosts forms only weak complexes with the alkali
and alkaline earth cations but forms strong complexes
with Ag+, 
Pb+2, 
and Cd+2
being the thioamides []. 
The cyclic pentamer is particularly effective for the extraction of 
Cd+2 and
the cyclic hexamer shows a high affinity towards 
Ag+/
Cu+2 
and Ag+/
Pb+2 selectivities.
Calixarenes binding sites at the sulfur atoms have the potential
for forming ditopic bimetallic complexes. There is some evidence
that this has been accomplished with Ag+ 
and
Na+ for the compound in which 
n = 6 although the same
compound excludes the Na+ 
ion []. Calixarenes
containing diphenylphosphoryl acetamide moieties on the upper rim
[] and lower rim [], respectively, are highly efficient extractants for Eu+3, Th+3, Np+3, Pu+3, and Am+3. The N,N-dimethyl dithiocarbamoyl ethyl ether is an effective extractant [, ] for Pd+2 and other heavy metals.

3.4. Lower-rim bridged calixarenes
Crowned calixarenes called calixcrowns, carrying bridging
polyethylenoxy moieties on the lower rim and being first prepared
by Ungaro et al. [] in 1983, have proved to be
very effective cation-complexing agents. They are characterized by
a high degree of molecular preorganization and therefore achieve
even higher selectivity, especially among alkali ions. In contrast
to the esters, ketones, and amides, which are selective for
Na+, 
the calixcrowns show a preference for the larger
cations. Several calixcrown dialkyl ethers have been studied
[, 
]. 
The crown moiety and the calixarene restrict each
other's molecular flexibility leading to a better discrimination
by ion size. The ligand [] 
with a narrow cavity for maximum Na/K selectivity, which when mixed 
with flurophore makes an optode, can be miniaturized for intracellular
measurements.

An alternate conformation, but with azacrown-5 moieties
and its monocrown relatives, shows K+ selectivity in transport as well as in ISEs which translates into an optical
signal with the help of the nitrophenol chromophoric group
[–] ().

Attaching benzo or naptho groups to the crown moiety increases the
Cs/Na selectivity. The Cs/K selectivity on the other
hand improves to over 4000 after removal of the two phenolic
oxygens outside the crown cavity []. 
Doubly crowned
calix[4]arene such as () 
avoid the need for
protective groups during synthesis and can bind two metal ions in
one molecule.

4. CONCLUDING REMARKS
Since last few decades calix[n]arenas 
(n = 4–8), like cyclodextrins and crown ethers, have played an important role as host for ions, neutral molecules, and organic guests. The first
part of the review mentions in detail the “calixarenes,” their
origin, and the different modifications that are possible within
this molecule. The calixarene molecule due to its reactive
positions at the upper rim (removal of alkyl group) and the lower
rim (removal of hydroxyl group) can be functionalized with
identical or different binding groups. The few examples discussed
here demonstrate the unlimited possibilities that exist for
molecules like calixarenes for modifications. Their modified
potential applications have been discussed towards the second half
of the article, which range from their use as selective sensors
for different analytical applications and medical diagnostics to
their use in decontamination of wastewater, construction of
electrodes, and membranes for transportation.
