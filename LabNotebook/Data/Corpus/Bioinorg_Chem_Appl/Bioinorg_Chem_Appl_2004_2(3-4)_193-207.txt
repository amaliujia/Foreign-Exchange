ABSTRACT
Cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition studies were performed for five distinct cobalt(ll)
[Co2(acac)tpmc](ClO4)3, [Co2(dibzac)tpmc](ClO4)3, [Co2(hfac)tpmc](CIO4)a, [Coa(tmhd)tpmc](CIO4) and
[Co2(ox)tpmc](CIO4)2"3H20 and five molybdenum(Vl) complexes, [MoOa(pipdtc)2], [MoOa(morphdtc)],
[MoOz(timdtc)a], [MoOz(pzdtc)z] and [MoOz(N-Mepzdtc)z]. The former were tested in two leukemia cell
lines: chronic myelogenic leukemia (K562) and human promyelocytic cell line (U937). They showed to have
relatively high toxicity in K562 cells and a relatively low cytotoxicity in U937 cells, as assessed by both
MTT and Trypan Blue assays. The five molybdenum complexes were tested in human promyelotic U937 cell
line and they showed to have high toxicity.
1. INTRODUCTION
In order to understand the mechanisms of action of chemicals on cells and tissues it is important to
perform cytotoxicity tests, since the cytotoxicity of a compound is thought to play an important role in a
number of pathological processes, including carcinogenesis and inflammation /l/. The use of cell culture
systems has become common in the toxicological assessment of chemicals and chemical mixtures. Various in
vitro cytotoxicity assays have been evaluated by large research groups all over the world in order to prove
their importance in toxicology/2/. What is certain is that in vitro testing minimizes the need for animal use .in
toxicity assessments, while it is useful in assessing the toxicity of new products in the early stages of
development.
Two in vitro citotoxicity assays were selected, five dinuclear cobalt(ll) complexes (l-V) with macrocyclic
ligand tpmc (N,N',N",N"'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)-l,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) and one of the
additional bidentate i.__e., 2,4-pentanedionato (acac), 1,3-diphenyl-l,3-propanedionato (dibzac), l, l, 1,5,5,5-
hexafluoro-2,4-pentanedionat (hfac), 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato (tmhd) or oxalate (ox) ions,

and five molybdenum(Vl)-dioxo complexes (A-E) with pipdtc, morphdtc, timdtc, pzdtc and N-mepzdtc
ligands that refer to piperidine-, 4-morpholine-, 4-thiomorpholine-, piperazine- and N-methylpiperazine-
dithiocarbamates, respectively, for use in the study. The viability of cells was determined by the Trypan Blue
dye exclusion method and cytotoxicity was assessed by the MTT assay.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
2.1. Materials
The reagents RPMI 1640 and Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), the antibiotics penicillin, streptomycin and the
buffers Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and HEPES were purchased from BIOCHROM. L-glutamine was
purchased from AppliChem. Trypan Blue, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide
(MTT), sodium-dodecyl sulfate (SDS), NaHCO3, formamide, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and methanol were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The syntheses of the cobalt(If) complexes (l-IV) were described elsewhere/3/as well as the synthesis,
structure and properties of the complex [Coz(ox)tpmc](CIO4)z-3H20 (V) /4/ and the molybdenum(Vl)
complexes (A-E) in literature/5/.
2.2. Cell cultures
Two human cell lines routinely maintained in the Biology Department ofNCSR "Demokritos" were used
in these studies. Chronic myelogenic leukemia (K562) and human promyelocytic (U937) cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.85 g/i NaHCO3, 25 mM
HEPES, 200 U/ml penicillin and 100 tg/ml streptomycin at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The pH of the
medium was kept 7.3 by use of HCI. In all experiments, all the cells used were cultured to logarithmic phase
growth over a period of48 h starting from a culture density 4.105 cells/ml.
2.3. Cell viability and cytotoxicity
The viability of cells was determined by the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method and cytotoxicity was
assessed by the MTT assay /6-9/. Briefly, logarithmically grown cells were plated in 25 cm flasks and
treated with two concentrations of each cobalt compound dissolved in DMSO and with two concentrations of
each molybdenum complex dissolved in methanol.
Control cells were treated with DMSO alone and positive controls with various amounts of five cobalt
complexes (l-V). Control cells were treated with methanol alone and positive controls with various amounts
of five molybdenum complexes (A-E). Untreated cells were used as a negative control before each
experiment. In more detail, before the addition ofthe compounds, the toxicity ofthe two solvents alone in the
cell lines was tested. For the compounds (I-V) two volumes of DMSO were tested: One that gives 100 tg/ml
concentration of each compound in solution and one that gives 0 lag/ml concentration. The same test was
194
Nikos Katsaros et al. Bioinorganic Chemistty andApplications
done for the toxicity of methanol. It was found that the toxicity of both the solvents was not significant
(>80% alive cells ). As a result, the maximum volume of each compound in DMSO or methanol that could be
added in the cell culture was 150 tl. Due to this limitation and taking into account that the compounds had
different solubilities in the solvents used, the concentrations ofthe compounds that were tested differed.
Incubation was carried out at 37 C for different time periods, starting from 24 h of incubation up to 72
hours. After drug incubation for various time periods at 37 C, 50 tl of MTT (l mg/ml, Sigma) was added to
each well followed by 4 h incubation at temperature of 37 C. The reaction results in the reduction of MTT
by the mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells to a purple formazan product. Cells were lysed, using
DMF solution (55 ml H20 + 12.5 g SDS + 45 ml formamide, at pH 4.7) and left overnight. After
centrifugation, 200 tl of each sample was placed in 96-well microtiter plates in duplicate and OD550 ,m was
determined in an ELISA plate reader. The results were expressed as the percentage ofalive cells as calculated
from MTT reduction, assuming the absorbance of control cells as 100%. The 50% inhibitory concentration
(concentration of drug required to inhibit cell growth by 50%, IC50). was calculated for each complex tested
from dose-response curves for incubation periods of 24, 48 and 72 h for U937 cells, and 24 and 48 h for
K562 cells for cobalt compounds, and 24, 50 "and 72 h for molybdenum compounds. In addition, cell viability
in U937 and K562 cell lines was assessed by the method ofTrypan Blue exclusion. Trypan Blue (0.2%, 2 1)
was added to aliquots of cell-containing media (18 tl) and the percentage of viable cells (-ve cells) was
determined by counting on a hemocytometer the number ofcells able to exclude the dye.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Cobalt complexes
Each tumor cell line was treated with five different cobalt compounds, namely [Co_(acac)tpmc](CIO4)3
(i), [Co2(dibzac)tpmc](CIO4)3 (I1), [Co2(hfac)tpmc](C104)3 (111), [Coz(tmhd)tpmc](CIO4)3 (IV) and
[Co(ox)tpmc](CIO4).3HzO (V) and viability was determined using the MTT method as well as the Tryphan
Blue dye exclusion procedure. Figure represents the cell density variation as a function of the incubation
time of the cells with the five distinct cobalt(ll) complexes tested, for different concentrations in U937 cell
line, and in Table S1 (Supplementary Material) are the corresponding data. The dose-dependent cytotoxic
effects on K562 leukemia cells of those compounds, after 24 and 48 hours of incubation, are displayed in
Figure 2.
By analyzing these data, it is clear that all of the cobalt compounds (i-V) tested have relatively high
toxicity when introduced in U937 cells after 72 h of immersion, besides the complex V (Fig. I). In fact, data
obtained from MTT reduction assay showed that complex V is the least toxic from all of the cobalt
compounds examined, with higher values of alive cells after 24-72 h of incubation. Complexes I-IV have
high toxicity in U937 cells for concentrations equal or higher than 10 laM in 72 h time. These complexes
exhibited almost similar toxicity, which decreased when lower concentrations were used and increased when
the compounds were left in th cells for longer time. Also, it is evident from the results (Fig. 1) that no
definite trend was observed in the shift of cytotoxicity effect values but apparently the complex I! is the most
toxic for the U937 cells.

Complexes: in vitro Cytotoxicity
In the case ofthe compounds introduced in K562 cells line the effect of relatively high toxicity, when the
cells were incubated for 24 and 48 h, in the presence ofone ofthe cobalt complexes was found (Fig. 2). K562
cell line also showed low sensitivity to complex V. For concentrations of 10 tM or higher compounds i, 111
and IV might be considered to have significant cytotoxic and antiproliferative properties, while the complex
I! displays the highest cytotoxic activity for concentrations higher than 5 tM.
The results from the Table S (Supplementary Material) for the MTT assay show that ICs0 values for the
cobalt complexes in U937 cells were approximately 20 tM (for !)< 100 laM (for I!I) < 20 tM (for IV)< 50
laM (for V) in 24 h and 10tM (for !!) after 48 h of incubation time. The results presented in Table $2
(Supplementary Material) show that the IC50 values for the cobalt complexes in K562 cells were about 5 laM
(for !!) < 30 IaM (for IV) < 10 laM (for !!!) < 10 laM (for !) for the incubation time of24 h, and lower then 30
and 100 tM (for V) after 24 and 48 h of immersion, respectively.
Tables and 2 present the percentage of Trypan Blue (-ve) cells in U937 and K562 cell lines,
respectively. The data shows that the number of alive (unstained) cells in 24 and 48 h for U937 and K562
cells for all the complexes in average higher then 80%, which means that none of the complexes exhibit
significant necrotic effect on the cell lines tested. Increasing of incubation time and concentration of
investigated compounds decreased the value ofalive cells.
The results from both cell viability methods used in order to determine the toxicity of the cobalt(ll)
complexes indicate that the compounds exhibit lower toxicity in U937 cell line and more toxicity in K562
cells. Low toxicity in U937 cells is observed during the first 24 hours of immersion, and relatively high (after
48 h) and high toxicity when they were incubated for 72 h in the cells. This could be due to a lot of factors
such as induction of apoptosis or differentiation. Low toxicity in K562 cells during 24 h and relatively high
toxicity during the 48 h is noted for all of the complexes investigated. Also, the percentage of alive cells
derived from Trypan Blue dye exclusion procedure is high in both cell lines which means that the toxic effect
ofthe Co(ll) complexes (I-V) on U937 and K562 leukemia cell lines is relatively low, especially after 24 h of
incubation time.
3.2. Molybdenum complexes
Human promyelocytic cell line U937 was treated with two different concentrations of each molybdenum
complexes, namely [MoO2(pipdtc)2] (A), [MoO2(morphdtc)2] (B), [MoO2(timdtc)2] (C), [MoO2(pzdtc)z] (D)
and [MoOz(N-Mepzdtc)2] (E), and viability was determined using the MTT method as well as the Tryphan
Blue dye exclusion procedure. Figure 3 represents the cell density variation as a function of the incubation
time of the cells with the five distinct molybdenum(Vl)-dioxo complexes tested, for two different
concentrations in U937 cell line.
Molybdenum complexes were dissolved and tested in methanol solutions, which is not a common solvent
for compounds, which are introduced in cells. For this reason, control cells were treated with methanol alone
in order to see whether methanol alone is toxic for the cells. The results from both the assays performed
(MTT and Trypan Blue) showed that methanol does not have high toxicity on its own and that the number of
necrotic cells is low.

It can be seen in Fig. 3 that most of the molybdenum complexes examined have high toxicity in U937
cells which increases with time of incubation. Exception is complex E, which does not exhibit high toxicity
during the first 24 h of incubation.
The results presented in Table $3 (Supplementary Material) for the MTT assay, show that IC50 values for
the complexes (A-E) in U937 cells were approximately at 10 taM (for A) 20 taM (for B)> 50 taM (for D) >
50 tam (for C) in 24 h and lower than 5 tam and 50 tam (for E) after 24 h and 50 h, respectively. From all of
the molybdenum complexes tested E has the least toxicity, while C is the most toxic.
Table 3 presents the percentage of Trypan Blue (-ve) cells in U937 cell lines. The data show that the
number of alive (unstained) cells in 24, 50 and 72 h for U937 cells for all the complexes are higher then 85%,
which means that none of the complexes, except the complex C at higher concentration, exhibits significant
necrotic effect on the cell lines tested.
4. CONCLUSION
The cytotoxicity tests on selected cobalt and molybdenum complex compounds showed that the cobalt
compounds (l-V) had low toxicity in U937 cell line, while they exhibited high toxicity in K562 cells. The
results obtained by the molybdenum complexes in U937 cells showed that most of the complexes were toxic
during the first 24 hours of incubation. These results have confirmed that cobalt complexes are generally
active among a series of complexes, then group containing molybdenum. This difference can be due to a lot
of factors, as difference in metal centers presented as well as their coordination sphere surroundings.
The cell growth inhibition assays represent the standard criterion for the screening of antitumor
compounds. However, this approach does not give direct information on the mechanism of action of the
individual drugs, but we can say that these substances behave differently on cells under study probably
because they act on different mechanisms. The effects of the complexes to the leukemia cell lines can be due
to a number of factors, like induction of apoptosis or differentiation. What is certain in the case of most ofthe
compounds tested is that the toxicity of the compound that enters cells is roughly proportional to the
exposure time.
