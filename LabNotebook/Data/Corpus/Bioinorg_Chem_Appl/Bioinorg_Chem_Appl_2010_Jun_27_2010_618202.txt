1. Introduction
In 1828, Wöhler attempted to synthesize ammonium cyanate by reacting silver isocyanate (AgNCO) with ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). The outcome of this failed attempt was urea H2NCONH2 (U, ) which represents the first organic molecule synthesized in the laboratory from purely inorganic materials []. Urea has also been recognized as the first organic molecule that was synthesized without the involvement of any living system []. Nowadays, urea represents not only an important molecule in biology [] but also an important raw material in chemical industry [].

Restricting further discussion to the coordination chemistry of urea and its substituted derivatives, metal-urea complexes have attracted considerable interest since the discovery of the active site of urease, a metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia [, ]. Considerable efforts have been devoted to devise useful bioinorganic models for the active site of urease and provide information for the intermediates and its catalytic mechanism. That in turn drove to the structural and spectroscopic characterization of many metal-urea complexes []. Urea usually coordinates as a monodentate ligand through the oxygen atom, forming a C=O⋯M angle considerably smaller than 180°, in accordance with the sp2 hybridization of the O atom (A in ). The rare N,O-bidentate coordination mode (B in ) has been found in a very limited number of cases [, ], while in [Hg2Cl4U2] each U molecule bridges the two HgII atoms through the oxygen atom [] (C in ). Of particular chemical/biological interest is the ability of U to undergo metal-promoted deprotonation [, ]; the monoanionic ligand H2NCONH− adopts the μ2 (D in ) and μ3 (E in ) coordination modes. The N,N'-alkyl symmetrically substituted derivatives of urea (RHNCONHR), such as the N,N'-dimethylurea (DMU) and N,N'-diethylurea (DEU) () have only been found to coordinate as monodentate ligands through the oxygen atom (F in ).

Urea and its substituted derivatives have been extensively studied within the frame of organic crystal engineering due to their ability to form extended hydrogen bonded frameworks. In particular, symmetrically substituted ureas (i.e., RHNCONHR) form α-networks with each urea molecule donating two hydrogen bonds and “chelating” the carbonyl oxygen of the next molecule in the network. In contrast to the great number of studies concerning free ureas [–], little is known about the supramolecular structures based on hydrogen bonding interactions between simple metal-ureas complexes. Over the last decade, we have been studying the coordination chemistry of urea and its symmetrically substituted derivative DMU [–]. In all cases, ureas form stable complexes which are further connected to create extended frameworks by intermolecular/interionic hydrogen bond interactions. Despite the large number of metal-urea complexes which have been structurally characterized, the metal-DMU complexes are considerably less studied while there only three reports with crystal structures of metal-DEU complexes [–]. In this report we present our first results from the study of metal-DEU complexes, extending the known crystal structures of metal-DEU complexes to seven.

Lorentz, polarization, and Ψ-scan absorption corrections were applied using Crystal Logic software. The structures were solved by direct methods using SHELXS-86 [] and refined by full-matrix least-squares techniques on F2 with SHELXL-97 []. Details of the data collection and refinement are given in . Topological analysis of the nets was performed using TOPOS program package [, ].

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Synthetic Comments
The preparation of the three complexes reported here is summarized in ():


					
				

M = Co, X = BF4 (1); M = Co, X = ClO4 (2); M = Ni, X = ClO4 (3); M = Zn, X = ClO4 (4).

2,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP), is a known dehydrating agent which under heating eliminates the possibility of [M(H2O)6]2+ formation in solution.

Complexes 1–4 seem to be the only products from the MX2·6H2O/DEU reaction systems (M=Co, Ni, Zn, X= ClO4 and M=Co, X=BF4). Changing the solvent from EtOH to MeCN to THF and Me2CO as well as the DEU : MII reaction ratio from 6 : 1 to 12 : 1, 8 : 1, 4 : 1 and 3 : 1 does not seem to influence the identity of the products.

3.2. Description of Structures
Bond distances and angles for complexes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are listed in Tables , , , and , respectively. ORTEP plots of the cations [Co(DEU)6]2+, [Ni(DEU)6]2+, and [Zn(DEU)6]2+ present in complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are shown in Figures , , , and , respectively. Details of the hydrogen bonds of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are provided in Tables , , , and , respectively. Complexes 2, 3, and 4 crystallise in the triclinic space group P  and are isostructural. Complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c. The structures of 2–4 consist of almost perfect octahedral [M(DEU)6]2+ cations and ClO4− counterions, while the same [M(DEU)6]2+ cation and BF4− anions are present in the structure of 1. In all four structures, the metal ion sits on an inversion centre and is surrounded by six O-bonded DEU ligands. The M–O(DEU) bond distances in 1–4 are comparable to those in [M(DMU)6]2+ [, ]. The average M–O(DEU) bond lengths change according to the sequence 1 [2.098 Å] ≅ 2 [2.096 Å] &gt;3 [2.072 Å] &lt;4 [2.108 Å] following the Irving-Williams series []. The DEU molecules in 1–4 are coordinated in a bent fashion forming C=O⋯M angles ranging from 127.6° to 132.5°. This is the usual way of coordination of urea and its derivatives and has been observed in the similar [M(DMU)6]X2 complexes [–]. Linearly or approximately linearly coordinated ureas are rare and have been observed only in a few cases []. There are six strong intramolecular (intracationic) hydrogen bonds inside each cation with atoms N(1), N(11), and N(21) (and their symmetry equivalents) as donors, and atoms O(1), O(11) and O(21) (and their symmetry equivalents) as acceptors for 1, 3 and 4 and N(2), N(12) and N(22) (and their symmetry equivalents) as donors, and atoms O(1), O(11) and O(21) (and their symmetry equivalents) as acceptors for 2. These intracationic hydrogen bonds create six-membered pseudochelate rings providing extra stabilization to the [M(DEU)6]2+ cation. Overall the structural characteristics, that is, bond distances, agnles and intracation hydrogen bonding interactions in the [M(DEU)6]2+ resemble those found in the [M(DMU)6]2+ cations [, ] with an exception regarding two additional C-H ⋯ O H-bonds (and their symmetry equivalent) found in [Co(DMU)6](ClO4)2 and [Co(DMU)6](BF4)2 []. Complexes 1–4 extend to seven the number of structurally characterised DEU compounds. The three, previously structurally characterised, compounds are [SnBr4(DEU)2] [], [Fe(DEU)6](ClO4)2 [] and [Mn(DEU)6][MnBr4] []. Complexes 2–4 are isostructural to [Fe(DEU)6](ClO4)2. The average Fe-ODEU bond distance is 2.105 following the Irving–Williams series as stated above.

Although the intracationic H-bonding interactions are the same along the [M(DEU)6]2+ series as well as very similar with those found in the [M(DMU)6]2+ cations, the intermolecular/interionic interactions are quite different. That the complexes 2–4 are isostructural implies that the interionic hydrogen bonding interactions are the same. Therefore, only the hydrogen bonding of the representative complex 4 will be discussed. The [Zn(DEU)6]2+ and ClO4− ions in 4 have assembled to create an infinite 2D network through three crystallographically independent intermolecular (interionic) N-H⋯O(perchlorate) hydrogen bonds (and their symmetry related) (). Each perchlorate accepts three hydrogen bonds with the O(31), O(32), and O(33) atoms acting as hydrogen bond acceptors while each [Zn(DEU)6]2+ connects to six ClO4− anions through the remaining N-H groups (). As a consequence of the participation of O(31), O(32), and O(33) in hydrogen bonding, the Cl-O(31), Cl-O(32), and Cl-O(33) bond lengths [1.402(1), 1.318(1) and 1.440(1) Å, resp.] are slightly longer than the Cl-O(34) [1.290() Å]. In this arrangement, a binodal (3,6)-connected network forms with Schläfli symbol (43)2(46.66.83) (). This two-dimensional (2D) hydrogen-bonded kgd net is the dual of the kagome kgm-(3.6.3.6) net. It is worth noting that the 2D network adopted by 2–4 was not adopted by any of the [M(DMU)6](ClO4)2 complexes [, ] suggesting that the substitution of DMU by DEU substantially changes the intermolecular (interionic) interactions probably due to the larger ethyl groups (in DEU) instead of the smaller methyl groups (in DMU). Similar 2D networks have been adopted by [Zn(DMU)6](ClO4)2 [] and [Co(DMU)6](BF4)2 [] with the ClO4− and the BF4− anions acting as 3-connected nodes and the [M(DMU)6]2+ acting as 6-connected nodes but the connections are achieved through two N-H⋯X and one C-H⋯X hydrogen bonds (and their symmetry equivalents), (X = O(perchlorate) or F(tetrafluoroborate), resp.).

The intermolecular hydrogen bonding interactions in 1 are far more interesting that those in 2–4. The [Co(DEU)6]2+ and the BF4− anions have assembled to create a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogen-bonded framework through three crystallographically independent intermolecular (interionic) N-H⋯F(tetrafluoroborate) hydrogen bonds (and their symmetry equivalents). Each BF4− accepts three hydrogen bonds with the F(1), F(2) and F(3) atoms acting as hydrogen bond acceptors while each [Co(DEU)6]2+ connects to six BF4− anions through the remaining N-H groups (). In this arrangement, a (3,6)-connected network forms with the [Co(DEU)6]2+ cations acting as the 6-connected nodes and the BF4− anions as the 3-connected nodes. Although the connectivity of each ion seems identical to that found in 2–4, the arrangement of the [Co(DEU)6]2+ and BF4− ions is quite different resulting in a binodal 3D hydrogen-bonded network with a rutile (rtl) topology [, ] and Schläfli symbol (4.62)2(42.610.83) (). It is worth noting that none of the [M(DMU)6]X2 complexes [, ] adopts a 3D net.

3.3. Vibrational Spectra of the Complexes

					gives diagnostic IR bands of the free ligand and complexes 1–4. Assignments have been given in comparison with the data obtained for the free DMU [], the free DEU [] and its Co(II) and Ni(II) complexes []. The bands with ν(CN) character are situated at higher wavenumbers in the spectra of 1–4 than for free DEU, whereas the ν(CO) band shows a frequency decrease. These shifts are consistent with oxygen coordination, suggesting the presence of +N=C-O− resonant forms [, ]. Upon coordination via oxygen, the positively charged metal ion stabilizes the negative charge on the oxygen atom; the NCO group now occurs in its polar resonance form and the double bond character of the CN bond increases, while the double bond character of the CO bond decreases, resulting in an increase of the CN stretching frequency with a simultaneous decrease in the CO stretching frequency [, ]. The ν3(F2) [νd(BF)] and ν4(F2) [δd(FBF)] vibrations of the tetrahedral (point group Td) BF4− anion appear at 1100-1000 and at 522–580 cm−1 (broad bands), respectively, in the IR spectrum of 1 []. The IR spectra of 2–4 exhibit strong bands at ~1100 and 626 cm−1 due to the ν3(F2) and ν4(F2) vibrations, respectively, of the uncoordinated ClO4− []. The broad character and splitting of the band at ~1100 cm−1 indicate the involvement of the ClO4− ion in hydrogen bonding as it was established crystallographically (see above).

4. Conclusions
Following our studies on the coordination chemistry of urea (U) and N,N'-dimethylurea (DMU), N,N'-diethylurea (DEU) was employed as a ligand to form the stable octahedral complexes [M(DEU)6]2+ with cobalt(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II). The structural characteristics of the [M(DEU)6]2+ cation are very similar to the DMU analogs, that is, [M(DMU)6]2+. All six DEU molecules are coordinated to metal centre in a bent fashion forming a C=O⋯M angle of ~130°, while six strong intracationic N-H ⋯ O(DEU) hydrogen bonds stabilize the [M(DEU)6]2+ cations by creating six six-membered pseudochelate rings. The [M(DEU)6]2+ cations and counterions (ClO4− or BF4−) self-assemble to form extended hydrogen-bonded architectures via 3 unique N-H⋯X hydrogen bonds, (X = O(perchlorate) or F(tetrafluoroborate)). The nature of the resulting supramolecular architectures is influenced by the nature of the counter-ion since the presence of ClO4− counter-ions gives rise to the formation of 2D hydrogen-bonded networks that conform to the kgd net while the presence of BF4− counter-ions results in a 3D hydrogen-bonded net with an rtl topology. By comparing the supramolecular architectures of the [M(DEU)6]X2 (X=ClO4 or BF4) and the [M(DMU)6]X2 (X=ClO4 or BF4) we can conclude that the substitution of DMU by DEU considerably affected the nature of the hydrogen-bonded networks. We are presently pursuing our studies on the coordination chemistry of urea and its symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted alkyl derivatives to generate a rich variety of hydrogen-bonded networks.
