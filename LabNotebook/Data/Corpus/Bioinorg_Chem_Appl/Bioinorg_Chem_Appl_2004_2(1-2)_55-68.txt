ABSTRACT
The majority of aminoglycosidic antibiotics anchor Cu(ll) ions by {NH2, O} chelates of the A and C
rings of its molecule as distinct from amikacin, which belongs to the class of substituted ones. The results
indicate that all these antibiotics effectively bind copper(ll) at physiological pH. Cyclic voltammetry
investigations and kinetic studies of H202 disproportionation and hydroxyl radicals detection made it possible
to support the mechanism of oxidative reactivity of cupric complexes of aminoglycosides, which involves
Cu(1) and Cu(lll) redox states and metal-bound, rather than free radical species. The mechanism of this
process appears to be complicated, and may have deleterious side-effects by leaking radical intermediates.
The presence of these reactive oxygen species may be responsible for modulating the biological activity of
these drugs.
The interactions of copper(ll) complexes of aminoglycosides with oxidation-susceptible biomolecules:
2'-deoxyguanosine, plasmid DNA and yeast tRNAphe
in both the presence and absence of hydrogen peroxide
showed that the complexes with H202 are the most efficient oxidants, converting dG to its 8-oxo derivative,
generating strand breaks in plasmid DNA and multiple cleavages in tRNAphe. Some of these reactions may
play a role in aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; moreover, they may suggest that
Cu(ll)-aminoglycosides are potentially dangerous genotoxic agents.
These complexes were also screened for their antibacterial activity and bioassays were engaged to find
out the possibility of Cu(ll)-kanamycin A complexes to induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)
and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in human peripheral blood leukocytes. The aim of these studies was to compare
the biological action of antibiotic alone and complexed with copper(ll) ions in both neutral and oxidative
environment.

INTRODUCTION
Aminoglycoside antibiotics constitute a very important class of antibiotics, active against Gram-negative
and some Gram-positive bacteria. The mechanism of their action has been studied very extensively since the
discovery of their first representative- streptomycin. Their action is based on the interactions with ribosomal
RNA and also cytoplasmic membrane/1/. Apart from ribosomal RNA these drugs were proved to interfere
with HIV-1 viral Rev responsible element/2/and its different constructs/3/as well as TAR RNA/4/, group
introns/5/, hammerhead ribozyme/6/, RNase P RNA/7/and yeast tRNAphe/8/. The current knowledge of
the mode of action of aminoglycosides reports several adverse effects, such as ribosomal blockage,
misreading in translation, cellular membrane damage and irreversible uptake of the antibiotic /9/.
Aminoglycosides are still problem antibiotics since their therapy requires constant monitoring of the drug
concentration in blood plasma. The reason for this caution is a coexistence of various toxic effects such as
ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity/10/. Moreover, this group of antibiotics became suspected of another set of
deleterious side effects: hemato-, hepato- and neurotoxicity. It reveals a serious demand for the improved
and modified ones, but also for the detailed look into the chemical basis of their action. The drastic toxicity
of aminoglycosides, however widely explored, is still unclear. The formation of reactive oxygen species was
postulated to accompany the application of these drugs. Fe(II) complexation and generation of hydroxyl
radicals by gentamicin /11, 12/ and neomycin /13/ has recently been implicated in the mechanism of its
toxicity. As aminoglycosides themselves are redox-inactive, they need a specific medium to participate in the
oxidative pathway they undergo in human organism. Metal ions seem to be suspected the most. Literature
includes only few reports concerning comparative coordination study of some transition metal ions like
Co(ll), Ni(ll), Zn(ll) and Cu(ll) to aminoglycosides/14, 15/, as well as antimicrobial activity experiments of
those complexes/16/. Our recent investigations in this area demonstrate that these drugs, i.e. kanamycin A,
bind copper(If) several hundred fold stronger than other metal ions, both essential and toxic/I 7/. This fact
prompted us to undertake a profound study on Cu(II)-aminoglycosides coordination patterns and mechanisms
of reactivity of the resulting complexes. However, the amount of"free" Cu(11) in organism is low. Moreover,
intracellular copper is under very tight control, exerted by specific chaperone proteins /I 8/. Extracellular
copper is not controlled as tightly and is elevated in some pathological conditions, including cancer and
inflammation /19/. It is possible then, that some copper may be transferred to the molecule of antibiotic,
which gave us the basis for our investigations.

COPPER(il) COMPLEXATION BY AMINOGLYCOSIDES
Aminoglycosides possess a few donating groups in their molecules. These are mainly amino functions,
whose number varies between three and six. All these amines coexist with hydroxyl groups in their
neighbourhood. Such combinations of donors provide strong chelating sites for many biologically accessible
metal ions. The results of our studies provided evidence that from a range of metallic microelements, like
copper, iron, zinc, cobalt or nickel, aminoglycosides form the most stable complexes with Cu(ll) ions/17/.
The binding modes of the cupric complexes of unsubstituted aminoglycosidic antibiotics, like
kanamycins, involve both terminal aminosugar rings, chelating central metal ion by amine and hydroxyl
functions/20-24/(Fig. 1). Distinctly different is the coordination pattern of copper(ll) complexes of amikacin
/25/(Fig. 2). This antibiotic is a modified version of kanamycin A, having one amine group acylated. The
new formed amide function, together with neighbouring amino group constitute very strong binding site for
copper(ll) and coordinate the metal ion at physiological pH with a peptide fashion. The presence of Cu(ll)
ion enforces the specific, coiled structure of the complex molecule, what could be of significant importance
for the biological activity of the antibiotic, To characterize the complex species potentiometry was used, to
provide the stability constants and stoichiometry of the complexes. Spectroscopic methods (electronic
absorption, EPR and CD) brought evidence for the nature of donating groups and mass spectrometry helped
to confirm the stoichiometries ofthe species in solution.
It was shown that bleomycin can sequester copper(ll) and introduce it into the cell/26, 27/. Such an effect
on the metal homeostasis might also accompany the therapy with use of aminoglycosides. In order to
examine whether the antibiotic could be capable of disturbing copper(ll) content in blood plasma, the ability
of kanamycin A to remove Cu(ll) ions from saturated N-terminal binding site of human serum albumin was
tested /17/. The formation of NH ----, Cu(ll) charge transfer transition on CD spectra, characteristic for
copper(li) complexes of aminosugar-like ligands /20-23/ was observed. This would suggest that at favourable
conditions the complex formation might be possible, especially in case of high antibiotic concentration in
plasma, which may occur during intravenous or intramuscular injection.
OXIDATIVE ACTION OF Cu(il)-AMINOGLYCOSIDES
The oxidative properties of copper centres in metalloproteins are well known. Many cupric complexes of
xenobiotics were also proved to induce processes involving reactive oxygen species. Following that we
undertook studies concerning the oxidative action of the copper(ll) complexes of aminoglycosidic antibiotics.
The experiments were planned to characterize the possible oxidation states of copper centre, the behaviour of
the complexes in the presence of physiological amounts of hydrogen peroxide as well as description of the
reactive intermediates of the reactions and their final products.

To identi@ possible radicals generated from H202 by Cu(ll) complexes of aminoglycosides we performed
the experiments with two relatively specific reporter molecules: NBT, which reacts with superoxide radicals,
and NDMA, which is commonly regarded as specific towards hydroxyl radicals. Only Cu(li)-kasugamycin
complex was capable of superoxide radicals production/28/. Kasugamycin is not a typical aminoglycoside
and its copper chelating fashion is distinct from that observed for other antibiotics used in our study. The
58

classic aminoglycosides failed to demonstrate superoxide formation. However, the decomposition of NDMA
in their case presented the formation of strongly oxidizing ROS following H202 addition/23, 29/. Figure 3
shows the decrease of the characteristic band for NDMA absorption at 440 nm. This process is the most
effective in the presence of the complex and hydrogen peroxide, while uncomplexed copper induces ROS
production not so effectively. To carry out the unambiguous identification of the radical species, EPR
experiments were performed in the presence of DMPO. They yielded spectra characteristic for the adduct
with hydroxyl radical. Addition of excess ethanol to the system resulted in a complete quenching of radical
formation (Fig. 4).

The comparative experiment performed for the selected antibiotics showed that the most active is the
cupric complex of neomycin B/30/. It has also some reflection in toxicology. Beside streptomycin, which
was not included in the study due to its tendency to hydrolyse in the presence of metal ions, neomycin and
kanamycin B are the most toxic aminoglycosides to the kidney and inner ear and thus their clinical usage has
been limited. This process exhibits the distinct pH dependence/23/. The diagram at Figure 5 indicates that
complex in which maximum concentration exists around physiological pH is the most efficient radicals
producer. The pH profile of the control samples, containing uncomplexed Cu(II) ions, is quite different, with
a maximum at pH 9- where soluble Cu(II) hydroxides predominate over insoluble ones.
Cyclic voltammetry studies indicated that kanamycin A and amikacin are redox-inactive, while their
copper(ll) complex exhibited irreversible reduction and oxidation peaks in a wide pH range/23, 28/. The
cathodic scans revealed the presence of copper(Ill) ions in the complex. However, gasometric measurements
showed that these complexes not only activate hydrogen peroxide but also disproportionate it to water and
dioxygen, which are the final products of the process. Quantitative description of oxygen generation
phenomenon, including the presence of Cu(lII) ions and hydroxyl radicals as intermediate products, led us to
evaluate the mechanistic considerations/23, 28/:

accompany these reactions. Their presence was confirmed by mass spectrometry, which showed that the
initial target of oxidations is the complexed aminoglycoside molecule /31/. Apart from their formation,
fragmentations at glycosidic bonds and in the amide bond, linking the aglycon to ring B, were detected
(Fig. 6).

INTERACTIONS WITH NUCLEIC ACIDS AND COMPONENTS
Another type of oxidative activity engaging ROS, regarded in addition as a test for procarcinogenic or
promutagenic properties of the compound studied, is 2'-deoxyguanosine oxidation/3 l, 32/. Production of 8-
oxo-guanosine suggests that these complexes may oxidize nucleobases within DNA molecules and the
consecutive impairment of bases may lead to deleterious results, like mutations. This process seems to be pH
dependent, showing thereby that the complex present around physiological pH is the most efficient 2'-dG
oxidizing agent/32/(Fig. 7). The same species are also responsible for the specific 2'-dG conversion to its 8-
oxo derivative.

The DNA bases are not exposed in nucleic acids molecules. The attack on the guanine or any other
nucleobases is then difficult due to tight coils of sugar-phosphate backbone. The radical species, especially
diffusible hydroxyl radicals, usually react with the systems most proximal to their side of formation. So the
primary damage in case of nucleic acids would occur at the backbone. This results in two different
phenomena, single strand damage or the double one. The double strand damage may also be the consequence
of accumulation of single strand cleavages, which then lead to further degradation to short DNA fragments
/31, 32/. The stepwise character of plasmid DNA destruction through all the forms, caused by the complexes
studied, suggests that the DNA fragmentation is a result of accumulation of random single strand breaks in
the plasmid, rather than the immediate formation of double strand breaks. However, such a course was
proposed for Cu(ll) aqua ion interacting with DNA/33/. In fact, our control mixture of Cu(ll) ions and H202
also produced double strand scission in a stepwise fashion, but with much lower rate and yield than the
complex. From the dependence of plasmid DNA damage on pH, we conclude that the degradation starts at
pH 5, where the first complex form appears in solution /32/(Fig. 8). With the increase of pH the entire
amount of the complex forms existing in solution also rises at the expense of the amount of uncomplexed
copper(ll). This brings growth of the linear form and causes the complete destruction of the superhelical one.
At pH 7 and above, we observe almost total destruction of the plasmid. In this pH range the complex tbrm,
which is dominating in solution, is probably responsible tbr plasmid destruction.

The copper aminoglycosides were shown recently to interact with HIV-I viral Rev responsible element
/34/and in vivo, with R23 mRNA/35/. We have undertaken a study to describe the possibility of inducing
the damage to tRNA by aminoglycosides and their cupric complexes. The cleavage occurring in the presence
of antibiotic or the complex is highly specific and takes place in the anticodon loop, at hypermodified base
Y37 /30-32, 36/. Cleavage sites generated in the presence of copper-aminoglycosides in oxidative
surroundings were more numerous. After the addition of Cu(II)-H202 system no breakage was noticed at
Y37. This suggests that hypermodification present at this position is crucial for aminoglycoside binding and
the hydrolysis. Moreover, this also seems to be a characteristic feature ofthese drugs.
Interestingly, the relative cleavage efficiency induced in the presence of Cu(ll)-antibiotic complexes at
Y37 strongly depended on the number of amino functions in the aminoglycoside molecules/30/. Figure 9
presents the dependence of the hydrolysis extents at Y37 on the resultant charge of Cu(ll)-antibiotics
complexes, it turns out that this correlation is linear. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that the
63

cleavage efficiency is a function of the complexes binding strength in the vicinity of Y37, which rises with
the increase ofthe positive charge ofthe complexes.

In order to confirm the importance of hypermodification for the strand breakage process we compared
susceptibility to the cleavage reaction of natural tRNAPhe, its analogue devoid of modified nucleotides and
acDNA- a DNA oligomer of tRNA anticodon stem sequence/30/. The results presented in Figure 10 clearly
demonstrate that this cleavage occurred only within the natural tRNAPhe. Thus the tRNA anticodon stem,
neither in its RNA nor DNA form, is sufficient to undergo highly specific breakage. Hypermodified guanine
residues occur in the anticodon loops of several tRNAPh
molecules, including human one. It is conceivable
that those molecules may also undergo specific fragmentation in the presence of aminoglycoside antibiotics
or their complexes.

BIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS
Recently we have also undertaken the study of microbiological activity of the complexes in comparison
with the antibiotics alone, with use of 3 bacterial strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococus aureus
.and Escherichia coli. The data indicate that copper ion does not influence the bactericidal efficacy of the
antibiotics /32/. This may be the result of the complex hydrolysis in bacterial wall rich in
lipopolysaccharides, which contain many aminosugar moieties, similar to those in antibiotics. As a
consequence, copper may form stable complexes in the wall, but it requires further studies to estimate the
transport ofthe complex through the bacterial cell wall.
Because antibacterial agents and metal ions have the possibility to stimulate immunity system resulting in
generation of different factors /37, 38/, we examined the immunogenic activity of Cu(II)-aminoglycoside
complexes by measuring their influence on human peripheral blood leukocytes. The results of our studies
reveal that the complexes studied are non toxic for human lung adenocarcinoma cells at the concentrations
occurring after injections of aminoglycoside antibiotics /39/. We have also found that low doses of the
complexes may play an important role for the host, as stimulators of immune cells and phagocytes, by
producing relatively high levels of IFN, TNF and IL-10/17/. The effect on the cytokines release was dose
and time depended and the interdependence between IL-10 and TNF stimulation was found. The ability of
the cupric complexes of aminoglycosides to induce cytokines may enhance the production of further
inflammatory agents by the cells. As.a matter of fact, the effects of cytokines production by the complex
stimulated leukocytes do not appear to be very high, however, any interference into the immunity system is
disadvantageous and may enhance the known toxicity of aminoglycosides. The interactions of Cu(ll)-
antibiotics with the immune system may partially explain the undesirable effects of aminoglycosides on
human tissues.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of our studies indicate that aminoglycoside antibiotics effectively bind copper(ll) ions at
physiological pH. The complexes disproportionate H202 to dioxygen and water, in the process accompanied
by both metal bound and diffusible hydroxyl radicals. These species have also impact on aminoglycosides-
induced nucleic acids damage and nucleic bases oxidation. This clearly demonstrates that Cu(ll) complexes
of aminoglycosides may be regarded as potentially dangerous genotoxic agents and that the primary feature
influencing their reactivity is the resulting charge of the complex. Although these species probably cannot
enter bacterial cell wall, they activate the human tissue cells towards immunological mediators production.
The facts presented herein may be significant for understanding the origins of the toxic effects induced by the
drugs.
