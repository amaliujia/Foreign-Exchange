ABSTRACT
Industrial water systems often suffer from undesirable inorganic deposits, such as calcium carbonate,
calcium phosphates, calcium sulfate, magnesium silicate, and others. Synthetic water additives, such as
phosphonates and phosphonocarboxylates, are the most important and widely utilized scale inhibitors in a

plethora of industrial applications including cooling water, geothermal drilling, desalination, etc. The design
of efficient and cost-effective inhibitors, as well as the study of their structure and function at the molecular
level are important areas of research. This study reports various physicochemical aspects of the chemistry of
PBTC (PBTC 2-phosphonobutane-l,2,4-tricarboxylic acid), one of the most widely used scale inhibitors in
the cooling water treatment industry. These aspects include its CaCO3 crystal growth inhibition and
modification properties under severe conditions of high CaCO3 supersaturation, stability towards oxidizing
microbiocides and tolerance towards precipitation with Ca2+. Results show that 15 ppm of PBTC can inhibit
the formation of by ,-,35 %, 30 ppm by ,-,40 %, and 60 ppm by ,--44 %. PBTC is virtually stable to the effects
of a variety of oxidizing microbiocides, including chlorine, bromine and others. PBTC shows excellent
tolerance towards precipitation as its Ca salt. Precipitation in a 1000 ppm Ca2+
(as CaCO3) occurs after 185
ppm PBTC are present.

INTRODUCTION
Calcium carbonate /1/ and calcium phosphate(s) /2/ are the most frequently encountered deposits in
industrial water systems. Their accumulation greatly diminishes effective heat transfer, interferes with fluid
136

flow, facilitates corrosion processes, and can worsen microbiological fouling/3/. These phenomena are most
critical in cooling water applications, where incoming water passes through a heat exchanger, cools a "hot"
process and is sent back to repeat the same cooling process after it is cooled by forced evaporation/4/. This
water loss by evaporative cooling results in high supersaturation levels of dissolved ions. Eventually, massive
precipitation of sparingly soluble mineral salts can occur, either in bulk or on a surface that, in some cases,
causes catastrophic operational failures. These usually require chemical and/or mechanical cleaning of the
adhered scale, in the aftermath of a scaling event. Silica and silicate salts are such examples/5/.
Scale growth can be mitigated by use of scale inhibitors. They are key components of any chemical water
treatment added to process waters in "ppm" quantities and usually work synergistically with dispersant
polymers/6,7/.
Phosphonates belong to a fundamental class of such compounds/8/used extensively in cooling water
treatment programs /9/, oilfield applications /10/ and corrosion control /11/. PBTC, HEDP (hydroxy-
ethylidenediphosphonate) and AMP (amino-tris-methylenephosphonate) are "popular" and effective
commercial scale inhibitors (Figure 1) /12/. Phosphonates are thought to achieve scale inhibition by
adsorbing onto specific crystallographic planes of a growing crystal nucleus after a nucleation event. This
adsorption prevents further crystal growth and agglomeration into larger aggregates/13/.
Study of phosphonates is attracting additional interest due to their potential uses in sequestering toxic
metal ions in industrial effluents. Moreover, their established use as bone resorption agents and in treatments
for osteoporosis makes them desirable from a biological/pharmaceutical perspective.
Understanding the function of scale inhibitors requires a closer look at the molecular level of their
possible function. The present study aims toward this direction and reports the inhibition properties of 2-
phosphonobutane-l,2,4-tricarboxylic towards CaCO3 crystal growth inhibition under high supersaturation
conditions, as well as its stability towards oxidizing biocides and Ca2/
precipitation.
EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Preparations
All phosphonates were obtained from Solutia UK (Newport, United Kingdom). PBTC is available in acid
form under the commercial name Dequest 7000 as 50 % w/w solution in water and was used as received.
Aqueous solutions of PBTC are infinitely stable if common preservation practices are applied.
Stock solutions were prepared in deionized water as follows: CaC12"2H_O 10,000 ppm (as CaCO3);
CaCIz'2H20 20,000 ppm (as CaCO3); MgSO4-7H20 10,000 ppm (as CaCO3); NaHCO3 20,000 ppm (as
CaCO3); PBTC 2,000 ppm (as PBTC).
Instrumentation
A DR-2000 Spectrophotometer from the Hach Co. (Loveland, Co, U.S.A.) was used for halogen and
phosphate analyses. Protocols were followed according to the literature/14/. Ca2/
was measured by Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy.

Calcium Tolerance Procedure
An amount of the Ca2/
stock solution (400 mL) was placed in a glass container, which in turn was placed
in a water bath and allowed to achieve the desired temperature of 54 C (monitored by a thermosensor, built
into the pH probe) under continuous stirring (300 rpm). The solution pH was kept at 9.00 + 0.05 units using a
pH controller coupled with a syringe pump supplying 0.1 N NaOH (set at 0.50 mL/min). NaOH addition was
used for pH adjustment purposes only. Upon temperature equilibration, the PBTC solution was continuously
fed into the test solution at 0.50 mL/min rate, using a different syringe pump. During PBTC addition solution
pH was kept at 9.00 + 0.05 units. Solution turbidity (at 420 nm), conductivity and pH were monitored.
Signals were stored in a computer at 1 data point/min. At a certain critical PBTC concentration the slope of
transmittance started, to decrease, indicating turbidity increase due precipitate formation. Calcium tolerance
was calculated based on the amount of PBTC (in ppm) at the onset of precipitation. Calculations also took
into account dilution effects from external addition of solutions. The same procedure was followed for HEDP
and AMP.
CaCO3 Scale Inhibition Test
Ca2/, Mg2+, and HCO3 are expressed as ppm CaCO3, whereas PBTC as ppm actives. Appropriate
amounts of stock solutions were used to achieve final concentrations of Ca2+
(800 ppm), Mg2/
(200 ppm), and
HCO3 (800 ppm). In a volumetric flask Ca2/, Mg2/
were mixed and then the appropriate amount of PBTC
was added. Finally, the desired amount of NaHCO3 was added and the remaining volume was made up with
de-ionized water. The final volume of the test solution was 100 mL. The solution was then transferred to an
Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was covered and placed in a water bath maintained at 43 C. The solution inside
the flask was under constant stirring with a magnetic stirring bar. pH 9.0 was maintained by addition 0.1 N
NaOH via an auto-titrator. After a time period of 2 h the flask was removed from the water bath and a sample
was filtered through a 0.45 la filter. Analysis by atomic absorption spectroscopy gave the concentration of
soluble Ca2+. The remaining solution was covered and stored unstirred at room temperature. A second set of
samples was withdrawn from just below the surface 24 h after the pH was first raised to 9.0. The analytical
results of these unfiltered samples yielded the dispersed Ca2+
concentration. No further pH adjustment was
made before the 24 h measurement.
It should be noted that the experimental water used in the present study cannot cover the whole range and
variability of natural waters used for cooling purposes. It represents, however, a good "model" for the
precipitation chemistry taking place in most process cooling waters. Although other metal ions can form
foulant salts in supersaturated cooling waters they were not included in the study because they represent a
minority of problems. Such sparingly soluble electrolytes will be subjects of future reports.
Biocide Resistance Procedure
Appropriate amounts of stock solutions were used to achieve final concentrations of Ca-/
(200 ppm),
Mg2+
(100 ppm), and HCO3" (200 ppm). In five different volumetric flasks Ca2+, Mg2+
were. mixed and then
the appropriate amount of PBTC was added to give 5 ppm actives. Each biocide was added to the appropriate
139
Vol. 3, Nos. 3-4, 2005 Chemistry ofOrganophosphonate Scale Growth Inhibitors: 3
flask at a 5 ppm dosage (as total C12). Solution temperature was 25 C. pH was adjusted and maintained at
8.3. An aliquot was withdrawn after 1 h and was analyzed for phosphate (o-PO43) by the
molybdophosphoric method/14/.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Inhibitory Effect of PBTC on CaCO3Crystal Growth and Crystal Modification
Inhibitors are often required to control scale formation under very stressful conditions of metal ion and
carbonate concentration and pH. Instrument malfunction occasionally results into increase of cycles of
concentration well beyond the specification of the scale inhibition program used. pH sensors left uncalibrated
for long periods often give erroneous measurements. As a result, operating conditions of high supersaturation
levels and high pH are not unusual. Scale inhibitors can protect the system from such operational upsets and,
consequently, unwanted deposits.
In the present study high hardness conditions were used to model a situation where there is uncontrollable
increase of the cycles of concentration. This could very well occur when a malfunctioning conductivity meter
does not properly allow supersaturated water to escape from the system (blowdown) and be replaced with
make-up (fresh) water.
CaCO3 is the only insoluble salt precipitating under the conditions studied. Although Mg2/
ions are added
in the system (to "model" realistic process cooling waters) they do not cause precipitation of Mg(OH)2,
which forms at pH regions above 10. Precipitation of MgCO3 is not a possibility, since its solubility is much
higher than that of CaCO3.
Under the experimental conditions studied, PBTC can inhibit the formation of CaCO3 up to 350 ppm at a
60 ppm dosage level (Table 1, Figure 2). Its performance is comparable to that of HEDP and AMP under
similar conditions/12a/. Its effectiveness shows an upward trend as the actives level increases, Figure 2.
Under the conditions studied, PBTC does not appear to offer any dispersancy properties. This is
concluded based on the results obtained for dispersed Ca (Table 1, right column). Lower numbers for
dispersed Ca indicate that CaCO3 formation is continued over 24 h and that the CaCO3 formed cannot remain
suspended close to the air-water interface, where the sampling point is. In the presence of 15 or 30 ppm
PBTC, 20 ppm of Ca2/
are lost to CaCO3. At the level of 60 ppm PBTC, 40 ppm of Ca2/
precipitate into
CaCO3. Although these results do not constitute a complete kinetics study they are initial indications of the
inhibitory activity of PBTC against CaCO3 crystal formation under these "harsh" hardness conditions.
Suitable kinetics studies will be performed in our laboratories.
It is interesting to note that scale inhibitor performance largely depends on inhibitor structure. For
example, hydroxy-ethylidenediphosphonate (HEDP) exhibits excellent scale inhibition properties for CaCO3,
whereas methylenediphosphonate has virtually no activity (unpublished results). PBTC is one of the most
effective scale inhibitors. Citrate, a close structural analog to PBTC but with no phosphonate group, shows
little activity/15/.
Phosphonates in general also act as crystal modifiers. The precipitated scale crystals often exhibit

distortions caused by preferential phosphonate adsorption onto specific crystallographic planes of the salt
crystal. We isolated CaCO3 crystals precipitated without additives and those that crystallized from solutions
containing PBTC. The SEM images are shown in Figure 3. Untreated CaCO3 crystallizes as prismatic calcite
(one of the three CaCO3 polymorphs, the other two being vaterite and aragonite) with well-defined edges.
The presence of PBTC causes obvious changes to CaCO3 crystal morphology with rounded corners and
formation of aggregates. However one should also notice that the crystals formed in the presence of PBTC
are statistically fewer in number. Aggregation of CaCO3 crystals can be noticed in the presence of certain
additives. FT-IR of PBTC-treated CaCO3 crystals showed presence of bands associated with the -PO." group
(results not shown). This can be interpreted by inhibitor incorporation either within the CaCO3 lattice, or,
more likely, at the edges of CaCO3crystals.

Resistance to oxidizing biocides
Certain scale inhibitors, such as HEDP, AMP and other aminomethylene phosphonates, have well-known
susceptibility to oxidation by chlorine or bromine-based biocides (necessary to control microbiological
growth)/16/. Orthophosphate (PO43"), one of the degradation products, can cause calcium phosphate scale
deposition.
PBTC is virtually immune to oxidizing biocides and does not decompose to any appreciable extent, at
least at "normal" biocide dosage (see Table 2 and Figure 4). Biocide level used in these experiments (5 ppm)
is considered to be fairly high (levels well below ppm are considered common. Even under these "high
stress" conditions PBTC does not show any appreciable decomposition.
For comparison, we are presenting data taken from the literature on the effects of various biocides on
PBTC. These are taken from the work of Vaska/3a/and are presented in Table 3 and plotted in Figure 5. It is
evident that Vaska's results indicate a more pronounced decomposition of PBTC. This occurs because ofthe
following reasons: (a) The reaction time is longer (2 h vs. 1 h in our study) than our experiments (b) The

reaction temperature is much higher (70 C vs. 25 C in our study) (c) Biocide levels are significantly higher
(see Table 3). These are not realistic for common cooling water biocide applications. (d) The reaction pH is
somewhat lower (8.0 vs. 8.3 in our study). This affects effectiveness of hypochlorite, which functions more
effectively in lower pH regions.
Calcium tolerance
Certain applications of organophosphonate scale inhibitors are based on their precipitation as insoluble
species with ions such as Ca2/, Sr2/, Ba2/, etc. In geothermal wells, for example, precipitation of scale
inhibitors as alkaline earth salts is desirable. Large amounts of inhibitor are "squeezed" in the oilfield well
and remain there for a specified amount of time, during which the inhibitor precipitates with alkaline earth
metals found in the high-salinity brine and eventually deposits onto the rock formation. Once the well is
opened again for operation the metal-inhibitor salts slowly dissolve to provide adequate levels of scale
inhibitor in solution /17/. Controlled dissolution of these salts is essential, as fast dissolution will lead to
chemical wastage and slower dissolution will result in inefficient scale control.
In cooling water applications (particularly in open recirculating sustems) adequate levels of inhibitor at all
times is essential. In these systems, occasionally high supersaturation levels of Ca2/, coupled with inhibitor
overfeeding may lead to precipitation of insoluble Ca-inhibitor precipitates. Such precipitates can be
detrimental to the entire cooling water treatment program for several reasons:
(a) They cause depletion of soluble inhibitor, and, subsequently, poor scale control because there is little or
no inhibitor available in solution to inhibit scale formation.
(b) They can act as potential nucleation sites for other scales.
(c) They can deposit onto heat transfer surfaces (they usually have inverse solubility properties) and cause
poor heat flux, much like other known scales, such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, etc.).
(d) If the phosphonate inhibitor in the treatment program has the purpose of corrosion inhibition, its
precipitation as a Ca salt will eventually lead to poor corrosion control.
Based on the above, resistance to precipitation is a useful property of a scale inhibitor. Calcium tolerance
is defined as the ability of a certain chemical compound to remain soluble in the presence of calcium ions. It
usually decreases as pH increases. This is because at higher pH's the degree of deprotonation of inhibitors
(usually phosphonates or carboxylates) is higher.
Calcium tolerance becomes very critical as cycles of concentration increase. An efficient inhibitor must
interact strongly with Ca2/, but must be sufficiently soluble to remain in the system. Ca-inhibitor salt
precipitation is well known for phosphonate as well as carboxylate-based inhibitors/18/. Three of the most
commonly used scale inhibitors, AMP, PBTC, and HEDP, were studied comparatively with respect to their
Ca tolerance. The results are found in Table 4 and in Figure 6. The above inhibitors can be rated according to
their Ca tolerance in descending order (as ppm soluble inhibitor per 1000 ppm of Ca2/
as CaCO3): PBTC
(185 ppm) > AMP (12 ppm) > HEDP (8 ppm). The above results indicate that use of PBTC in applications
where maintenance of sufficient inhibitor levels is critical should be preferred. On the other hand, in other
applications where precipitation of the scale inhibitor is desirable, PBTC is not the best choice, due to its
145

unwillingness to form precipitates with metal ions.
A Ca-PBTC complex does not form under the conditions used in the CaCO3 Scale Inhibition Test because

CONCLUSIONS
The definition of the ideal scale inhibitor varies according to the particular application. The scale inhibitor
operating in open recirculating cooling water applications must possess desirable properties such as: (a)
excellent scale inhibition performance, (b) high metal ion tolerance (resistance of metal-inhibitor salt to
precipitate out of solution), (c) stability towards oxidizing biocides, (d) thermal stability (for high
temperature applications), and (d) low production cost.
The results of the present study are summarized as follows:
(a) PBTC is an effective CaCO3 inhibitor under conditions of high hardness and alkalinity.
(b) It is essentially immune to decomposition by oxidizing biocides at normal biocide levels. This makes
PBTC the ideal choice in water systems treated with oxidizers for microbiological control.
(c) PBTC possesses high calcium tolerance and its Ca complex salt does not precipitate under conditions of
extreme hardness.
The systematic study of a plethora of phosphonates and mixed phosphonates/carboxylates and their
inhibitory activity against metal salt scalants under conditions representing various industrial water treatment
applications are currently underway in our research efforts/19/.
