INTRODUCTION
Thiosemicarbazones are now well established as an
important class of sulfur donor ligands particularly for
transition metal ions [–
]. This is due to remarkable
biological activities observed for these compounds, which has
since been shown to be related to their metal complexing ability.
These compounds present a great variety of biological activity
ranging from antitumour, fungicide, bactereocide,
antiinflammatory, and antiviral activities [–
]. We
have previously examined the chelating behaviour of some NNS donor
thiosemicarbazones having pyrazolone ring in several metal
complexes with the object of gaining more information about their
nature of coordination and related structural and spectral
properties [, ].

In the present work, we report the synthesis, magne-tospectral,
antibacterial, and antifungal properties of copper(II) complexes
of 4[N-(benzalidene) amino] antipyrinethiosemicarbazone (BAAPTS), 4[N-(4′-methoxybenzalidene) 
amino] antipyrinethiosemicarbazone (MBAAPTS),
4[N-(4′-dimethylaminobenzalidene) amino]
antipyrinethiosemicarbazone (DABAAPTS) and
4[N-(cinnamalidene) amino] antipyrinethiosemicarbazone (CAAPTS)
().

EXPERIMENTAL
Materials
Copper(II) salts, for example, copper(II) chloride, bromide,
nitrate, or acetate, were obtained from BDH. AR-grade and were used
as such. Cu(SCN)2 was prepared by mixing copper chloride
(in ethanol) and ethanolic solution of potassium thiocyanate in
1 : 2 molar ratio. Precipitated KCl was filtered off, and the
filtrate having copper(II) thiocyanate was used immediately for
complex formation. All the four thiosemicarbazones were prepared
in the laboratory by reported procedure []. All solvents
obtained commercially were distilled before use.

The antibacterial activities of both thiosemicarbazones, that is,
BAAPTS and MBAAPTS complexes of copper(II), were studied by the
usual cup-plate-agar-diffusion method [, 
]. The compounds
were screened for their antibacterial activity against the
following microorganisms: (a) gram positive staphylococcus
aureus (S aureus), (b) gram negative E coli.
The cup-plate-agar-diffusion method comprises of the following
steps.

Preparation of media, sterilization, and
tubing.

Sterilization of the cleaned glass apparatus.

Pouring of the seeded medium into sterilized petridishes
and cutting of the cups.

Pouring of the dilute solution of the compounds into the tubs.

Incubation at a particular temperature.

Determination of the “zones of inhibition.”

	
			

The composition of the test media is the factor, which often
exerts the greatest effect upon the drug activity. This is
particularly true for thiosemicarbazones, since inhibitors of
these compounds appear to be present in the common bacteriological
culture medium. Efficient media of known chemical composition are
available for many species such as S aureus and E
coli. In addition to the composition of the test media, its pH is
a factor which may directly or indirectly influence the activity
of a drug. The pH of the test media taken for S aureus
and E coli was adjusted in the range 7.6 ± 0.1. The composition of the basal media used in the experiments was 
 (i) sodium chloride = 6.0 gm, (ii) peptone = 10.0 gm, (iii) beef  extract =
3.0 gm, (iv) yeast  extract = 2.0 gm, (v) sucrose = 1.5 gm, (vi) agar-agar =
3.0%, and (vii) distilled water = 1.0 litre.

Procedure
The measured quantity of the culture of the test
organism (0.5 mL) was  added to each heated (nearly ∼ 55°C) 
agar-media tubes. The tubes were shaken well, and the
inoculated media were poured on to the sterilized
petridishes and then allowed to set in a refrigerator maintained
at 4–8°C. The test solutions of 500 μg/mL and
1000 μg/mL dilutions of the respective thiosemicarbazones
were prepared in a mixture of DMF and H2O (3 : 7, v/v).
Five cups of 5 mm diameter were cut in the culture media on
the pertidishes. A compound solution of particular dilution
(500 μg/mL or 1000 μg/mL) was put in the outer
four cups of one of the petridishes, and the second solution was
put in the four cups of other petridishes. The central cups of all
the petridishes were filled with the controlled solution, and all
the petridishes were allowed to remain in the refrigerator
maintained at ∼ 10°C for ∼ 1 hr to allow
diffusion of the solution. The petridishes were then transferred
to an incubator maintained at ∼ 35°C and kept for
nearly 30 hrs. The zones of inhibition formed were measured
with calipers. The control of DMF and H2O (3 : 7, v/v)
showed no activity. The activity of the compounds are represented
by size of the diameter in mm. The antifungal activity of the
compounds was screened by using filter paper disc diffusion
method. The tests were carried out by taking 6 mm diameter
filter paper discs against the fungi (A niger and
C albicans).

Synthesis of the complexes
All the copper(II) complexes were synthesized by following general
procedure. The corresponding copper(II) salt and the appropriate
thiosemicarbazone in equimolar ratio were dissolved, separated in
ethanol, and mixed together. The reaction mixture was boiled under
refluxing state for ∼ 4 hrs. On cooling at room
temperature, a microcrystalline complex was separated. It was
filtered under suction, and the crystals were washed with cold
ethanol and finally with anhydrous diethyl ether and kept in a desiccator over
fused CaCl2.

Analyses
Copper contents of the complexes were estimated complexometrically
with EDTA using murexide and erichrome black T as an indicator
after decomposing the complexes with concentrated
H2SO4 and 
H2O2 
[]. The halogens
were estimated by Volhard's method []. The thiocyanate was
estimated by titrating slightly acidic solution of the complex
with standard silver nitrate solution. Sulfur was estimated
gravimetrically as BaSO4. The percentage of nitrogen was
determined by Kjeldahl method. The molecular weight of the
complexes was determined in the laboratory cryoscopically in
freezing nitrobenzene using a Beckmann thermometer of accuracy
±0.01°C. The conductivity measurements were carried
out using a Toshniwal conductivity bridge type CL 01/01 and dip
type cell operated at 220 volts, AC mains. All the
measurements were done at room temperature in PhNO2. The
magnetic measurements on powder form of the complexes were carried
out at room temperature on Gouy's balance using anhydrous copper
sulfate as calibrant. The infrared spectra of the complexes were
recorded on a Perkin Elmer Infrared Spectrophotometer model-521 in
KBr/CsI in the range of 4000–200 cm−1 at the University
of Delhi, Delhi, India. Diffused reflectance spectra of the solid
compounds were recorded on a Beckmann-DK-2A Spectrophotometer at
the University of Delhi. Thermogravimeteric analysis of the
complexes was carried out in static air with open sample holder
and a small platinum boat, the heating rate was 6°C/min.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reaction of Cu2+ salts with BAAPTS, MBAAPTS,
DABAAPTS, and CAAPTS gave complexes of the general composition
CuX2 (L) (H2O) 
(X = Cl,
Br, NO3, 
NCS, or CH3COO; 
L = BAAPTS, MBAAPTS, DABAAPTS, or CAAPTS). The analytical
data of these complexes are presented in . All
the complexes are quite stable and could be stored for months
without any appreciable change. The complexes do not have sharp
melting point, but decomposed on heating beyond 250°C.
These complexes are generally soluble in common organic solvents.
The molar conductance values of the complexes in PhNO2 are
presented in . The values are too low to
account for any dissociation, therefore the complexes are
considered to be nonelectrolytes []. The molecular weights
determined by cryoscopic method in PhNO2
() are in broad agreement with the conductance
data. The observed magnetic moments of all these complexes
() are in 1.81–1.92 BM range. The
observed magnetic moments of the complexes are consistent with the
presence of a single unpaired electron [, 
].

Biological properties
A number of authors [–
												] were interested to
investigate the biological and medicinal properties of transition
metal complexes of thiosemicarbazones. Thomas and Parmeswaran 
[] studied the antitumour activities of
Mn2+, Co2+, 
Ni2+, and Cu2+
chelates of anthracene-9-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone.
Murthy and Dharmaraja [] reported the cytotoxic activity of
phenylglyoxal bis(thiosemi-carbazone) against
Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells. These
compounds were also screened for antimicrobial activity on
B subtilis and E coli. They inhibited the
bacterial growth considerably. Garg et al [] have recently
reported the antifungal activity of some transition metal
complexes of 2-(2′-hydroxybenzylidene)aminophenyl benzimidazole.
All complexes were screened against Alternaria alternata
and Aspergillus niger by spore germination inhibition
method at concentrations 100, 500, and 1000 ppm using Dithane
M-45 as a standard. Recently, Singh [] published a review
article on metal complexes of glutathione and their biological
properties. Copper(II) is the most important oxidation state of
copper in many physiological systems. Cu(II) complexes of
glutathione were tested for their antifungal activity against some
plant pathogenic fungi using slide germination technique
[]. Cu(I) is another important oxidation state of
copper in physiological systems. Cu(I)-thioamino complex
formation serves not only to improve the chelation therapy for
treating intoxication, but may also provide a better understanding 
of many facets of normal copper metabolism
[–], 
since copper is an essential trace
metal which can adopt a redox system in biological system allowing
it to play a pivotal role in physiology. Copper homeostasis in
biological system is well characterized, involving several
proteins such as glutathione, metallothione, ATPase, Menkes, and
Wilso proteins as well as the cytoplasmic copper chaperons. In
view of the biological relevance of copper(II) complexes, in the
present studies, the antibacterial activities of the copper(II)
complexes of BAAPTS and MBAAPTS and standard drugs (ampicillin and
teracycline) were screened by the agar-cup method in DMF 
solvent at a concentration of 50 μg/mL and were
checked against gram positive bacteria B subtilis and
S aureus and gram negative bacteria E coli and
S typhi (). Diameters of zone of
inhibition (in mm) of standard drug ampicillin against gram
positive bacteria B subtilis and S aureus and
gram negative bacteria E coli and S typhi were
found to be 15, 13, 17, and 18, respectively, while tetracycline
gave 18, 17, 21, and 22, respectively, under identical conditions,
 show that all copper(II)-thiosemicarbazone
complexes have moderate antibacterial activities against these
bacteria. Both thiosemicarbazones and their copper(II)
complexes were screened for their antifungal activities against
two fungi (A niger and C albicans). The results
() showed that almost all complexes showed
nearly the same extent of activity, but they are less
active compared to salicylic acid. It is interesting to note that
due to the presence of methoxy group and comparatively faster 
diffusion of MBAAPTS complexes, they showed increased
activity than that of BAAPTS complexes. These compounds
were found to be efficient antifungal agents.

INFRARED
A study and comparison of infrared spectra of free ligands
(BAAPTS, MBAAPTS, DABAAPTS, or CAAPTS) and their Cu2+
complexes (Tables  and ) imply that these
ligands behave as neutral tridentate and the copper(II) is
coordinated through N &amp; N 
of two azomethine groups
and of S of thio-keto group.

The strong bands observed at 3440–3270 cm−1
region in the free ligands have been assigned to ν(NH) vibrations. Practically no effect on these frequencies after
complexation precludes the possibility of complexation at this
group. The absorption at ∼ 1600 cm−1 in the free
ligands can be attributed to (C=N) stretching
vibrations of imine nitrogen, which is in agreement with the
observations of previous authors [, 
]. On
complexation, these frequencies were observed to be shifted
to lower wave number (Tables  and ). These
observations suggest involvement of unsaturated nitrogen atoms of
the two azomethine groups in bonding with the metal ion. In
substituted thioureas, the (C=S) stretching vibrations
are contributed much with some other vibrations as (CN) stretching
and bending as well as (N−C−S) bending modes
[]. In the spectra of the present ligands, the bands
observed in 1330–1305 cm−1 region, 
1120–1095 cm−1,
and 820–760 cm−1 regions are assigned to
[ν(C=S)+ν(C=N) +
ν(C−N)], [δ(N−C−S)
+ δ(C=S)] bending and ν(C = S−)
stretching, respectively, following the observations of Irving
et al [] and some other authors [, 
].
Coordination of sulfur with metal ion would result in the
displacement of elections toward the latter, thus resulting in the
weakening of (C=S) bond. Hence, on complexation,
(C=S) stretching vibrations should decrease and that of
(CN) should increase [, ]. 
In all present complexes of Cu2+ with BAAPTS, MBAAPTS, DABAAPTS, 
and CAAPTS, the frequencies in 1330–1305 cm−1 get an increase by nearly
30–60 cm−1. Similarly, bending modes of
(N−C−S) and (C=S) also get increase,
but in lesser amount. On the other hand, on complexation, the
frequencies in 820–760 cm−1 are shifted to lower wave
numbers and intensity of the bands are also reduced. All these
peculiar changes on complexation confidently precludes any
unambigious ascertain of metal-sulfur bond.

The possibility of thione-thiol tautomerism
(H−N−C=S) (C=N−SH) in these ligands has
been ruled out for no bands around 2700–2500 cm−1,
characteristic of thiol group is displayed in the infrared
absorption [, ]. 
In far infrared region, the bands in
410–330 cm−1 are tentatively assigned to
ν(Cu−N)/ν(Cu−N) (metal-ligand)
stretching bands [, ]. 
In conclusion, the infrared
spectral studies suggest the tridentate (N,N,S) nature by
pointing out the sites of possible donor atoms.

The presence of coordinated water was suggested by the very broad
absorption centered around 3450 cm−1 in the infrared
spectra. Bands at ∼ 930 and 770 cm−1 may be
attributed to rocking and wagging modes of the coordinated water
[].

ANIONS
The pseudohalide (SCN−) 
	ion is a very interesting anion
since it may coordinate through the sulfur (thio-) or through the
nitrogen (isothio-) or through both these atoms (bridging). The
various criteria proposed for determining the mode of bonding have
been discussed by Nakamoto []. In general, the bonding
depends on (a) the nature of the central atom, (b) the nature of
other ligands in the coordination sphere, and (c) environmental
controls and kinetic (mechanistic) controls. In the present
complexes, the frequencies in 2045–2035 cm−1 due to
(C−N) stretch (ν1), 845–835 cm−1
due to ν(C−S) stretch (ν2), and
465–400 cm−1 for δ(NCS) have been identified.
These frequencies are associated with the terminal N-bonded
isothiocyanate ions [, ]. 
In nitrate complexes, the
occurrence of two strong bands in 1550–1535 cm−1 and
1315–1300 cm−1 are attributed to ν4 and ν1 modes of vibrations of covalently bonded nitrate groups,
respectively. This suggests that nitrate groups are present inside
the coordination sphere [, 
]. Other absorptions associated
with covalently bonded nitrate groups are also observed in the
spectra of these complexes. If the (ν4 − ν1) difference is taken as an approximate measure of the covalency of
nitrate group [, 
], a value of ∼ 200 cm−1
for the complexes studied suggests strong covalency for the
metal-nitrate bonding. Lever et al [, 
] have shown that
the number and relative energies of nitrate combination
frequencies (ν1 + ν4) in the 1800–1700 cm−1
region of the infrared spectrum, may be used as an aid to
distinguish the various coordination's modes of the nitrate group.
According to Lever et al [, 
], bidentate coordination
involves a greater distortion from D3h symmetry than
unidentate coordination, therefore, bidentate complexes should
show a larger separation of (ν1 + ν4). The authors
have tried to apply this method to the present complexes. In all present complexes, a separation of
15–25 cm−1 in the combination bands (ν1 + ν4) in the 1800–1700 cm−1 region concludes the
monodentate nitrate coordination.

ELECTRONIC SPECTRA
Electronic spectra data of all copper(II) complexes
are collected in . The  spectra of these
complexes consist of a broad band (16000 ± 200 cm−1) of medium intensity in the visible region
which can be identified as a d − d band of the central ion, that
is, an electronic transition mainly localized on Cu(II).
The spectra of tetragonality distorted complexes should consist of
three bands corresponding to the transitions
2B1g→
2A2, 
2B1g→
2B2g, and 
2B1g→
2Eg in order to
increase energy. But generally, such complexes exhibit
[, ], 
a broad structureless band with or without shoulder
between 14000–18000 cm−1 depending upon the strength of
in-plane and axial ligands. Since only a single d − d broad band
at 16000 ± 200 cm−1 has been observed in the
complexes reported herein, it is concluded that all three
transitions be within this broad envelope. The calculated
10 Dq values are also included in .

THERMAL STUDIES
Comparatively less is known about the thermal properties of
transition metal complexes of thiosemicarbazones
[–, 
–]. 
In the present work, we report herein
the thermal decomposition data of the two representative
complexes, that is, [Cu(BAAPTS)H2O(NO3)2] and
[Cu(CAAPTS)H2O(CH3COO)2], presented in
. The careful analyses of thermogravimetric
curves suggest that both complexes contain one molecule of
coordinated water, which is evident by loss in weight at ∼ 160°C. 
There is no change upto ∼ 300°C after
that there is a break in the curves due to evaporation of 0.5
molecule of organic ligand, the remaining ligand is removed from
the coordination sphere at ∼ 600°C. Finally, at ∼
760°C, CuO is formed [, 
].

The probable structures of the present complexes are suggested as in .

CONCLUSION
Thus in the present studies, all the thiosemicarbazones are
coordinating to Cu2+ ion as neutral tridentate (N, N, S)
ligands. The magnetic and elecytronic spectral studies suggest the
distorted octahedral geometries of the present
complexes. Copper(II) complexes of BAAPTS and MBAAPTS have
 moderate antibacterial activity against E coli
and  S typhi and antifungal activity against
A niger and C albicans.
