1. INTRODUCTION
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is  the cofactor  of many enzymes, including carboxylase, transketolase, phosphoketolase, and so forth (see
) []. It catalyzes the decarboxylation of α-ketoacids and the formation of α-ketols.

Thiamine pyrophosphate can undertake three conformations,
depending on the relative orientations of the two rings of
pyrimidine and thiazolium, determined by the torsional angles
ΦT = C(5′)–C(3, 5′)–N(3)–C(2), ΦP =
N(3)–C(3, 5′)–C(5′)–C(4′). These conformations are the common F, found
in all derivatives of free thiamine, with ΦT =
0° and ΦP = ±90; the S
conformation, constantly found in all 2-substituted derivatives of
thiamine, with ΦT = ±100° and
ΦP = ±150°, and the most rare V
conformation with ΦT  = ±90° and
ΦP = ±90°, where the C′4–NH2 group approaches the C2–H of
thiazolium [].


Bivalent metals are also required for the action of thiamine
enzymes (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+ in vivo) or
transition or post-transition metals (e.g., Ni2+,
Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, etc., in vitro).



The accepted mechanism of action of thiamine in its enzymes was
proposed by Breslow [] and involves the addition of pyruvic
acid to the C2 atom of thiazolium, following its
deprotonation and the ylide formation (see
).



Intermediate (A) is called an “active aldehyde” and it presents
an O−–S+ electrostatic interaction,
contributing to the internal neutralization of the charge of
thiazolium. Such “active aldehyde” intermediates can be isolated
[].


Despite the general acceptance of Breslow mechanism, there remain the
following questions unanswered in it:
the role of bivalent metal  ions,
both in  vivo (Mg2+) or in vitro
(Mg2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Ni2+,
Cd2+, etc.);

the role of various parts and the conformation taken by TPP during the
various enzymic steps.




We have attempted to provide answers to these questions and
proposed a detailed mechanism of action by studying the
interactions of bivalent metals, with thiamine model compounds, in
recent years [, ]. We have subsequently tried to immobilize
thiamine and derivatives into silica and look upon the catalytic
properties of the composite materials produced.


In this paper, we are briefly reviewing all these efforts and conclusions
drawn and proposing future applications.


2. INTERACTION OF THIAMINE WITH BIVALENT
METAL IONS
To investigate the role of bivalent metals in the enzymatic action
of thiamine, it is important to elucidate the way the metals are
bound to thiamine derivatives, such as coordination sites. Towards
this goal, early research was directed in the preparation and
elucidation of structures of bivalent metals with thiamine and
derivatives. However, all these failed to give an answer to this
question, due to the net positive charge on thiazolium ring and
the easy protonation of N′1 atom of pyrimidine (pKa
≅ 5) resulting in double charged species. Thus, several
double salt-type complexes of thiamine were reported in literature
[] of formulae [MX4]2− [Th]2+, [MX4]2− [Th]2+, or [MX3]2 −[Th]2+, depending on pH. (M is
Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, etc.; X is
Cl−, Br−; Th is thiamine).  All these
contained no direct metal-ligand bonding. An example is the
Hg2+ complex [] of  the formula 
in .

The earlier reported Pt2+ and Pd2+ thiamine
derivatives (), however,
were for the first time proposed to have a zwitterionic structure,
with the metals bound at the N′1 site of pyrimidine
[]. This demonstrated the importance of this position as
potential coordination site of metal ions. It indicated also that
the net positive charge on N3 of thiazolium was the real
reason for the difficulty to form complexes with direct
metal-ligand bonds. The proposed structures were later confirmed
by X-ray crystal structure determinations for these and other
bivalent metals [].

In the “active aldehyde” intermediates of thiamine catalysis
(), the net positive charge on N3 of thiazolium is partially internally neutralized, due to the
S+–O− electrostatic interaction,
resulting by a partial positive charge migration to the
S1 position of the ring. We therefore thought that if
“active aldehyde” derivatives of thiamine were used, instead of
thiamine itself, the problem of complex formation with direct
metal-ligand bonds might be overcome. This was proven to be true,
using the “active aldehydes” 2-(α-hydroxybenzyl)thiamine (HBT) and 2-(α-hydroxycyclohexylmethyl)thiamine (HCMT) and the metals
Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Co2+,
and Ni2+ [, ]. Working at pH  ∼ 5.3, all
complexes obtained corresponded to the zwitterionic formulae
MLCl3 and presented an M-N′1 direct
interaction [, ]. Important was also the fact that all
ligands either free or complexed were adopting the S
conformation, and that the internal S+–O− interaction continued to be the same in the
complexes, like the ligands.


These findings led to the following conclusions:
the easy formation of complexes with direct metal-ligand bonds of
bivalent metals with thiamine “active aldehyde” derivatives, than thiamine
itself, strongly indicates that the metal interaction in the enzymatic
action should follow the formation of the “active aldehyde” intermediates.

The S conformation may be important in the enzymatic cycle, since it is
retained after the formation of the direct metal-ligand bonds.




3. INTERACTION OF THIAMINE MONO- AND PYROPHOSPHATE “ACTIVE ALDEHYDE” DERIVATIVES WITH BIVALENT METAL IONS
Since the phosphate esters of thiamine are the factors for its enzymatic
action, a better conclusion on the role of metal ions cannot be drawn
without a detailed study of the interaction of bivalent metals with thiamine
phosphate esters. With this aim we continued our efforts starting with the
interaction of “active aldehyde” derivatives of thiamine monophosphate
(HBTMP) with bivalent metal ions, followed by “active aldehyde”
derivatives of thiamine pyrophosphate (HBTPP and HETPP).

Depending on pH, three types of complexes were obtained from the
interaction of HBTMP with Zn2+, Cd2+, and
Hg2+ in aqueous solutions. There exist at
pH ∼ 1 the double salts of formula
[MCl4]2− [LH]22+ (L is HBTMP; and M are the
named metals), at pH ∼ 3.5 the M(LH)Cl3
of a zwitterionic formula, with the metals bonded
through the phosphate moiety, and at pH ∼ 6
complexes of formula MLCl2 [], with the metals
simultaneously bonded through N′1 and pyrophosphate
oxygens []. Hg2+ produced the complex
HgL2Cl2, at pH ∼ 6 with the metal
bound at the N′1 site of the pyrimidine moiety only. The
crystal structure of the free ligand and the HgL2Cl2
complex showed an S conformation for the ligand [].
1H NMR ROESY spectra confirmed the existence of the S
conformation for the free ligand in solution, in all cases,
demonstrated by a cross peak between the C4–CH3 group of thiazolium and the C′6–H of pyrimidine [].

Using HETPP and HBTPP as ligands (L), we also
prepared complexes of formulae
{K[Zn(LH)Cl2(H2O)]}m,
{K[Cd(LH)Cl2(H2O)]}m,
K2[Hg(LH)2Cl2], and Zn(LH)2Cl2. Both sites of pyrimidine and pyrophosphate oxygens are once more shown
to be potential coordination sites [, ]. The X-ray crystal
structure determination of the ligand has again shown the S
conformation for it []. The same conformation was adopted
by the ligand in all isolated complexes, as the 1H NMR ROESY
spectra revealed [, ].

These studies led to the following conclusions:
both the N′1 site and the phosphate group of thiamine phosphates
may be important metal binding sites;

the importance of the S conformation in the mechanism of the enzymatic
action of thiamine is emphasized;

the nature of the metal is important in determining the coordination
site. For example, in contrast to the lighter Zn2+,
Cd2+ metals, the heavier Hg2+ reacts only with
N′1 site of thiamine monophosphate, even at
pH ∼ 6.





4. THE CONFORMATION THAT THIAMINE MAY
UNDERTAKE DURING THE ENZYMATIC ACTION
Using the model peptide Asp·Asp·Asn·Lys·Ileu mimicking the protein
environment, surrounding the pyrophosphate moiety of TPP, we
studied the ternary system [M2+]-[peptide]-[HETPP] of
Zn2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+ [, ].
The pyrophosphate oxygen atoms and the N′1 site of
pyrimidine were once more proven to be the metal coordination
sites and thiamine once more was found in the S
conformation.

It should be noted here that the base approaching the
C2–H atom of thiazole was earlier proposed
to be the 4′-NH2 group of pyrimidine, thereby forming
the ylide, by attracting its proton and initiating the reaction
[]. Such a role of the 4′-NH2 group requires a
V conformation for thiamine, found only rarely in its free
derivatives. However, this conformation was constantly found in
the crystal structure of several thiamine examples, obviously
imposed and stabilized by the enzymic environment [, ].
Metals like Mg2+ and Ca2+ were linking
thiamine pyrophosphate with the apoenzyme through the
pyrophosphate group [, ].


These results showed that both the V and S
conformations are important and possibly succeed each
other in the mechanism of action of thiamine enzymes [, ],
as shown in .
The V conformation initiates the reaction by attracting a
proton from C2 and creating an ylide, and the S
conformation is adopted after the formation of the “active
aldehyde” intermediates, when a metal may also coordinate with
N′1, besides the pyrophosphate group. The S
conformation favors an
S+–O(2a)− electrostatic
interaction, which facilitates the release of a proton and
aldehyde and regenerates the ylide.

5. BIOMIMETIC CATALYSIS
The tethering of thiamine pyrophosphate and its derivatives on
silica via the pyrophosphate group is expected to produce
novel composite biomimetic materials, where silica would replace
the protein environment of the natural enzyme. These materials
would also be expected to catalyze thiamine reactions in vitro.

In fact, TPP and its derivatives were immobilized on silica,
[, ] according to the reaction in
.

In the same way, the “active aldehyde” intermediates HBTPP and
HETPP were also immobilized on silica and their catalytic
properties were evaluated and compared with the ones of TPP
itself. The materials obtained corresponded to formulae
[HBTPP–OP2O6–SiO3/2]n · xSiO2, [HET–OP2O6–SiO3/2]xSiO2, and
[Th–OP2O6–SiO3/2]n ·
xH2O. Their catalytic activities were subsequently evaluated
in the absence of the corresponding aldehydes
,  or in the presence of them
, , as shown  below:





The results on benzoyl-formate decarboxylation are summarized in
 and compared with the homogeneous systems.

It is thus obvious that the immobilized thiamine pyrophosphate
derivatives are far more efficient catalysts than the
corresponding homogeneous systems, reducing the reaction time
from 330 minutes of the homogeneous system to less than 5
minutes only, for 100% yield 
in both reactions ,  and , . Detailed  mechanisms of action have been proposed for both reactions as shown in
.

These very effective and promising heterogeneous
biocatalysts may be evaluated in future studies for the
enantioselective production of optically active 2-hydroxy-ketones.
