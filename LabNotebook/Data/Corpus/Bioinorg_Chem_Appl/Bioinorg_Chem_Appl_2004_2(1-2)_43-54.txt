ABSTRACT
The synthesis and characterization of the organotin compounds [(n-C4H9)zSn(cys)] (1), [(C6Hs)2Sn(cys)]
(2), [(C6Hs)3Sn(Hcys)'(H20)] (3), {[(CH3)2Sn(Kcys)2]'2(H20)} (4), {[(n-C4Hg)zSn(Kcys)z]'2(H20)} (5) and
{[(C6Hs)zSn(Kcys)z].2(H20)} (6) (where H_cys L-cysteine) are reported. The compounds have been
characterized by elemental analysis and 1H-NMR, Uv-Vis, FT-IR and MOssbauer spectroscopic techniques.
Attempted recrystallization of (2) in DMSO/methanol 2:1 solution yielded after several days unexpectedly
the dimeric compound bis(tri-phenyltin)sulphide {[(C6Hs)aSn]2S} (7) which has been characterized by x-ray
analysis. The structure of the parent complex (2) as well as the mechanism of the decomposition of cysteine
are being further investigated. The in vitro anticancer activity of complexes (I)- (6), against human
leukemia (HL60), human liver (Bel7402), human stomach (BGC823) and human cervix epithelial human
carcinoma (Hela), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) and lung cancer (PG) tumor cells, were evaluated.

Antitumor Properties
I. INTRODUCTION
The biological activity of organotin(IV) compounds is well known/1-3/. Most organotin(IV) compounds
are generally toxic /3/. The binding of organotins by thiol groups, on the other hand, is significant in
biological systems /4/. A great deal of work has been reported thus far, on the interaction of organotin
compounds with thiol-containing mercapto-amino acids such as cysteine and its derivatives/3, 5-14/. The
interpretation of the results however, was rather controversial. Thus, based on M6ssbauer spectroscopy
Barbieri et al. /6/proposed a penta-coordinate structure for the L-cysteinato(S-)-triorgano-tin(IV) hydrate
[R3Sn(Cys)(H20)] (R Me- or Et- group) /6, 8/. A penta-coordinate geometry around tin atom was also
proposed by Huger et al./10/for [Ph2Sn(Cys)]. The anti-leukemic activity of compound [Ph2Sn(Cys)] was
evaluated by Huber et al./8/and was found to be remarkable in relation to its low toxicity. A tetrahedral
arrangement around tin(IV) was proposed for [Ph3Sn(HCys)] by Hyams et al. /14/and Huger et al. /10/.
According to spectroscopic data Bamgboye et al. /7/ proposed a polymeric chain structure for [(Ph3Sn)2cys]
with penta-coordinated tin atom/7/, while a double anionic structure was proposed by Domazetis et al./13/
for the {[(Me)2Sn(OH)2(cys)]2} at high pH. The crystal structure of the ethyI-L-cyteinatoS,N-(chloro-
dimethyl) stannate(IV) [(Me)2Sn(CI)(SCH2CH(NH2) COOC2H5] /11/ was determined by X-ray analysis and
indicated S, N chelated coordination of the ethyl-ester of cysteine with the tin atom in a distorted trigonal
bibyramidal configuration.
Another demand for such studies raised from the potential pharmaceutical application of organotin
compounds/5, 15/. Today, a number of organotin (IV) derivatives are known to have an efficient anti-turnout
activity/15/. A comparison of the structures of the active and inactive compounds suggests that all active
compounds should conform to the following requirements: (i) to have available coordination positions
around Sn, (ii) to have a relatively stable ligand-Sn bond (e.g. Sn-N and Sn-S) with low hydrolytic
decomposition/5/.
The aim of the present work is the exploration of new synthetic routes for the synthesis of organotin(IV)
complexes with cysteine, the better characterization of the compounds formed and the evaluation of anti-
cancer activity ofthe complexes derived and characterized.
2. EXPERIMENTAL
Materials and Instruments:
All solvents used were reagent grade, while organotin chlorides (Aldrich), cysteine (Merck) were used
with no further purification. Elemental analysis for C, H, N, and S were carried out with a Carlo Erba EA
Model 1108. Infra-red spectra in the region of 4000-370 cm were obtained in KBr discs while far-infra-red
spectra in the region of 400-50 cm were obtained in polyethylene discs, with a Perkin-EImer Spectrum GX
FT-IR spectrometer. A Jasco Uv/Vis/NIR V 570 series spectrophotometer was used to obtain the electronic
absorption spectra.. The H-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC250 MHFT-NMR instrument in
CDCI. solutions. Chemical shifts i are given in ppm using TMS as an internal reference. The gsn

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
General aspects
Compound (1) has been synthesized using a water/methanol/chloroform 17:3:20, solvent system while
compounds (2) and (3) were synthesized in a water/methanol 17:3 according to equation (1)
RnSnCl4.n + 2 H2Cys + (4-n) Na2CO3
RnSn(Hn.zCys) + 2 (4-n) NaCI + (4-n) H20 + (4-n) CO2 (eq 1.)
(where n--2 and R C4H9-(1), C6H5- (2) or n=3 and R: C6H5- (3)).
Compounds (4), (5), (6) have been synthesized in a water/methanol 7:10 solution, according to equation
(2)
R2SnCI2 + 2 H2Cys + 4 KOH {[RzSn (K Cys)2] 2(H20)} + 2 KCI + 2 H20 (eq. 2)
where R=CH3-(4), C4H9-(5), C6H5-(6)
The formulae of complexes synthesized were deduced from elemental analysis and spectroscopic data.
Complexes (1) (3) are soluble in DMSO, while complex (1)is also soluble in chloroform, dichloromethane
and acetone, (3) is soluble in methanol and acetone, while (4)-(5) are soluble in methanol.
Compound (3) was synthesized previously from {(C6Hs)3Sn(OH)} and L-cysteine in chloroform/water or
methanol/ether media by Huber et al./10/and Hyams et al. /14/. Huber et al./8, 10/have also, reported the
synthesis of {(C6Hs)zSn(cys)} (2) by reacting {(C6Hs)2Sn(OH)2} with cysteine in chloroform/water. The
interaction of L-cysteine with tri-phenyltin(IV)producing {bis-(triphenyltin)cysteine} {[(C6Hs)3Sn]2(Hcys)}
was also studied by Bamgboye et al./7/.
Attempted recrystallization of (2) in DMSO/methanol 2:1 solution yielded after several days the dimeric
compound bis(tri-phenyltin) sulphide {[(C6Hs)3Sn]2S} (7) which was characterized by x-ray analysis and
found identical to the one previously reported by Glidewell et al./16a/, Cox/16b/and D'yachenko/16c/. The
method of preparation of the crystal was different however. In addition Domazetis et al. /17/ detected
{[(C6Hs)3Sn]2S} by mass spectroscopic techniques.
The de-sulphuration reaction of cysteine is known to play a role in thiol catabolism in biological systems
/19/.
A possible mechanism of de-sulphuration of {(C6Hs)2Sn(cys)} (2) may be summarized below, knowing
that such compounds decompose slowly on standing, forming bis(tri-phenyltin) sulphide {[(C6Hs)3Sn]2S}
/17/. Cysteine was also detected by IR and mp in the precipitate.

Both coordination and increase in the ionic character of the carboxylate group tend to reduce the
asymmetric v(O-C=O) frequency/12, 20-21/. The Vas(COO) is observed at 1575 cm in free cysteine/22/.
The corresponding Vas(COO) vibration in the spectra of complexes (1)-(3) shift to higher frequencies (Table
1) indicating coordination of cysteine through the carboxyl group to tin atom/10, 13/. The magnitudes ofthe
[Vas(COO) vs(COO)] (Av) separation in complexes (I)-(3) (Av=239+8) are comparable to those reported for
organotin derivatives of L-cysteine and L-cysteine ethyl ester/12, 13, 2 I/. The conclusions drawn above are
further supported by the presence in the IR spectra of a sharp band at 560+20 cm-,which was assigned to the
Sn-O stretching vibration/2 I/(Table 1). The organotin compounds (4)-(6) have carbonyl Vas(COO) vibration
at 1627+ 10 cm-.The band position of Av [Vas(COO) -vs(COO) =228+10] in the case of compounds (4)-(6)
indicate coordination of cysteine through the carboxyl group to tin atom as well/12, 13, 21/. The stretching
frequencies for NH2 group in the ir spectra of compounds (I)-(6) can help to distinguish coordinated from
free amino groups. The v(NH2) of the free amino group is observed at 3166cm in cysteine/13, 22/. The
assignment of the-NHz group has been made by deuterization of the samples using D20. The corresponding
v(NH2) vibrations of the organotin derivatives (I)-(6) remain at the same frequency indicating that
coordination through the amino group of cysteine to tin atoms does not take place. These conclusions are
further supported by the absence in the far-IR of a band assignable to v(Sn-N)/21/. The absence of v(S-H)
bands in the IR spectra of compounds (I)-(6) shows a coordination of sulfur to tin atom. The stretching
48

frequency ofC-S bond in IR spectra of cysteine is observed at 691 cm-I/13, 22/. The corresponding vibration
v(C-S) of organotin derivatives (!)-(6) shifts to lower frequencies (Table 1) supporting the same conclusion.

The occurrence of two symmetric Lorentzian doublets in the spectra of compounds (1)-(6) show two
distinct coordination sites with tin/2, 23/. The values between the quadruple splitting resonances of the two
symmetric Lorentzian doublets in the spectrum of compound (3) (Table 2) differ significantly, allowing the
assignment of the environment around the tin atom/7/to be made. In the case of compound (3), a resonance
with smaller splitting (tin moiety with contribution of 80% in the sample) is similar to that in [(Ph3Sn)2Cys]
/7/ and is assigned to a tetrahedral [Ph3SnS] environment, while that with the higher splitting resonance
corresponds to the penta-coordinated Ph3Sn(Cys,S-)(OH2) environment /7/. For compound (5), the inner
doublet was assigned to the BuSn-S moiety while the outer doublet was assigned to the BuSn-O moiety/12/.
The quadruple splitting values (AEq) of complexes (I)-(6) are typical of organotin thiolate derivatives
/12/. The AEq values of compounds (I), (2), (4) and (6) are in the range of 2.35 to 3.02 mms
-showing
octahedral arrangement around tin(IV)/7, 14, 24/. The low values of the quadruple splitting parameter, AEq
(<1.77 mms-), in the case of complexes (3) and (5) are characteristic of a tetrahedral geometry around tin
/25/.

(3) and (6) show high cell toxicity against BGC. Cell toxicity at concentrations of 10 JM and the cells were
viable to less than 10 %. A further systematic investigation of the biological properties of these metal
compounds is recommended focusing on their mutual significance for tumor induction of neoplastic growth.
