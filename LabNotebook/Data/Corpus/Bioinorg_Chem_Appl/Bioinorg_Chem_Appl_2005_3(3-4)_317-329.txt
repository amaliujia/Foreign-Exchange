ABSTRACT
Previous studies established some Ti compounds as having marked activity against tumors of the
gastrointestinal tract and lack of side effects common to widely used cytostatic agents. We describe pertinent
structural features of known antitumor Ti agents and other potentially active compounds. Particularly
noteworthy features are that Ti-O bonds are short and Ti-O-Ti bond angles are large, demonstrating that in
these compounds the O binding has high s-character approaching sp hybridization.
/'he successful drug development/1/of the antitumor agent cis-diaminodichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) 1,
generated a search for other active metal compounds and cis-diethoxy-bis(1-phenylbutane-l,3-
dionato)titanium(IV), [(bzac)2Ti(OEt)2] (budotitane) 2, was the first non-Pt metal antitumor compound that
reached clinical trials /2/. The ligand 1-phenylbutane-l,3-dionato bzac benzoylacetonato, is an
asymmetric [3-diketone chelator useful tbr establishing one key structural feature tbr activity in budotitane,
namely, the existence of two OEt cis leaving groups, which arc analogous to the 2 CI in cisplatin. Another Ti
antitumor agent is titanocene dichloride, (Cp)2TiCI2 3, Cp cyclopentadienyl, which possesses 2 CI leaving
groups/5/.
Among the differences between Ti antitumor drugs and cisplatin is the spectrum of activity, as Ti drugs
operate against gastrointestinal tumors whereas Pt drugs do not. On the other hand, P338 and LI210
leukemia are sensitive targets for Pt drugs but not for budotitane/4/. Other differences include a much faster
hydrolysis rate of the leaving groups in the former, and the environment where the metal-leaving group
bonds cleave: outside the cell for Ti drugs and inside the cell tbr Pt drugs/1/.
Titanocenc dichloride shows a larger spectrum of activity compared to budotitane. This is likely due to
better solubility in physiological medium and it is currently in phase II clinical tests /5/, whereas the

development of budotitane is limited by formulation problems /6/. Titanocene dichloride interacts with
transferrin, a protein associated with iron transport, and suggests a possible mode of entry into the tumor cell.
That is, the protein, with a Ti atom bound to one of its 2 domains/7,8/, could cross the tumor cell wall, which
is characterized by greater amount of transferrin receptors than present in normal cells, and allow metal
interaction with unknown targets.

Due to fast hydrolysis of C1 in titanocene dichloride and OEt in budotitane, oligomerization of Ti
compounds is seen. Two of these products are also active, [(Cp)2TiC1]2(t-O) 4/9/and [(bzac)2TiC1]2(-O) 5
/10/.
Fig. 4: X-ray structure of [(Cp)TiC1]2(t-O) 4, Ti-O-Ti bond angle 174.
Fig. 5: [(bzac)2TiCl]2(t-O) 5.
Since 13-diketone asymmetry is an essential feature for high activity in budotitane and related compounds
/2/, we are studying closely related Ti derivatives with 4-acyl-5-pyrazolones 6 as ligands, see Figure 6. These
are asymmetric 13-diketones having 3 possible substitution options.
A compound showing in vivo antitumor activity (T/C about 300%) against TA-3 (mouse mammary
adenocarcinoma) in AJ mice, slightly lower than that found for budotitane against other tumors/2/, was
synthesized by our group /11/. It is a bis(4-acyl-5-pyrazolonato)titanium(IV) tetranuclear cyclic species,
[(Q)_Ti(.t-O)],t 7; Oi has R R't
Ph, R Me, see Figure 7. Compound 7 is a stable intermediate in the
Ti-monomer hydrolysis/polymerization pathway that interfered with budotitane studies, where hydrolysis of
OEt and bzac ultimately can induce formation of TiO2.
Since ligand asymmetry is an unexplained yet relevant parameter in budotitane studies we describe
selected features of related compounds. A tetranuclear species [(tmhd)2Ti(-O)]4 8, containing the symmetric

Fig. 8: X-ray structure of [(tmhd)2Ti(-O)]4 8. The symmetric ligand tmhd induces equal Ti-O bond lengths
in the planar 8-membered ring. The core complex, enolato rings, and one whole ligand are shown.
13-diketonato ligand tmhd 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dionato, shows 3 sets of Ti-O bond distances/12/,
see Figure 8. Set (a) describes the shortest bonds that are located in the 8-membered ring (Ti-la-O bonds),
with values about 1.81 /. Set (b) includes the longest bonds (about 2.12 A) that are trans to the Ti-O bonds
forming set (a). Set (c) shows the intermediate Ti bonds that are trans to each other (about 1.97 A); sets (b)
and (c) are formed by Ti-O(tmhd) bonds. The driving force responsible for these relevant geometrical
features is the trans influence, a property of some metals in their coordination complexes.
From the X-ray crystal structure of 7 there is further splitting of sets (a) and (b) and an alternate sequence
of short-long lengths in the Ti-p-O bonds (Ti-O. 1.767(6)/1,, O3-Ti2 1.859(6)/, Tic-On,= 1.758(5)/,
O4.-Ti. 1.868(4)/), see Figure 7a. Trans to each Ti-kt-O bond a Ti-O(acyl) bond is found; these are also
split. The 8-membered ring common to 7 and 8 is further affected by ligand asymmetry, as the latter is planar
whereas the former is not. In addition, Ti-O-Ti bond angles are about 170 in 8 whereas in 7 they are about
150.As already mentioned, dinuclear compounds 4 and 5 are also active. Therefore the tendency ofTi to
321

and Related Compounds
polymerize, through O(oxo) bridges, raises the question as to whether a polynuclear form is an entity needed
to induce antitumor activity, as seen for compound 7. We also analyze structurally related Ti polynuclear
species, not yet tested, indicating the parent antitumor compound they stem from, if applicable. Dinuclear
compounds include, [(Cp)2Ti(HT.O)]z(l.t-O)]2/
9, obtained from (Cp)2TiC12 /13/ and [(Cp)TiC12]2(-O) 10/14/
obtained from (Cp)TiC13. Some trinuclear complexes include [(Cp)3Tia(I.t3-O)(t.ton)3(I.t-HCOO)a]+
11, a
cationic cyclic species obtained after hydrolysis of (Cp)2TiC12 and addition of formic acid/15/; the cationic
cyclic species [(Cp)aTi3(txa-O)(l.t-OMe)a(OMe)3]+
12, /16/; [(Cp)2TiCI(I.t-O)]2(Cp)TiC1]3/
13, a non-cyclic
species obtained from (Cp)2TiC12 hydrolysis/17/and the neutral species [(Me-Cp)2TiCI(-O)]3 14/18/.
Compounds 11 and 13 are obtained after Ti-Cp cleavage. This is an important step in titanocene dichloride
mechanism of action because it is required for Ti interaction with transferrin. Some tetranuclear compounds
are [(Br(CH2)2-Cp)Ti(t.t-O)Br], /19/ and [(Me5-Cp)Ti(-O)Br]4 15/20/. A tetranuclear species with additional
O(oxo) bridges is [(Me-Cp)4Ti4(-O)C12] 16/21/, whereas [(Me4Ph-Cp)4Ti4(-O)6] 17 shows a later stage
of C1 hydrolysis/22/. Even more complex structures are cluster compounds, such as [(Cp)6Ti6(3-O)6(t3-
C1)2] 18/23/and a cage example is [(Cp)sTis(-O)12] 19/24/.
Compounds 15-17 are tetranuclear Ti-Cp derivatives closely related to those of -diketone ligands of
Figures 7 and 8. Further, compounds 4, 7-10, 12, 13, 15 and 19 show large Ti-O(oxo)-Ti bond angles and
short Ti-O(oxo) bond lengths. The large values of Ti-O-Ti angles are not induced by steric hindrance. For
instance, the t-O(oxo) atom links 2 TiCpC12 groups in compound 10 with a Ti-O(oxo)-Ti bond angle of 180
and two Ti-O(oxo) of 1.73 A, whereas, in compound 4 it links 2 bulkier TiCp/C1 groups with a Ti-O(oxo)-Ti
bond angle of 174 and Ti-O(oxo) of 1.83 A.
The evolution of Ti-Cp compounds towards TiO2 through hydrolysis can be seen by following the
sequence of figures 3, 4, 9, 14-19, that is, loss of CI, formation of Ti-O-Ti bridges and loss of Cp. The same
trend .is seen for Ti-13-diketone compounds in the order 2, 5, 7, 8. This behavior suggests that titanocene
dichloride and budotitane share similar biological pathways. Compounds 9-19 could aid in clarifying the
mechanism of Ti antitumor action if appropriate formulations become available.
Mononuclear derivatives Q2TiX2, X C1, OMe, OPr, were recently also obtained /25/. NMR shows
features consistent with hydrolysis; for instance, in (QB)2Ti(OPrn)2 formation of prnoH is detected after 20
minutes. Hydrolysis is reversible since upon addition of priOH, formation of (Ti-OPri)-containing species is
observed. This reverse hydrolysis is related to that obtained when EtOH is added to polynuclear species
stemming from previous budotitane hydrolysis/2/. We describe a hydrolysis step of the bis--diketonato
titanium species, (acac)Ti(OH)(OCH3), acac acetylacetonat0, as studied by Density Functional Theory
(DFT).
(acac):Ti(OH)(OCH3) + H:O > (acac)2Ti(OH): + CHAOS
The energy of the products is 15 Kcal/mol higher than that of the reagents. Nonetheless, this feature
agrees with the reverse hydrolysis of Ti-OEt and Ti-OP.r bonds mentioned above. Therefore, the direction of
hydrolysis is likely determined by environmental conditions such as acidity and reagent/product
concentration. This may be related to the fast reaction of titanocene dichoride with proteins in the body/26/.
Octahedral 6-coordinate titanium derivatives containing asymmetric ligands can theoretically exist in
solution as a mixture of several cis and trans isomers. However, for related dialkoxy- and dihalo-

energy geometry using DFT methods for the three cis stereoisomers of Q_TiX2 (CIS1, CIS2 and CIS3). For
(QV)zTiCb (Qr: R Ph, R Me, R4
neopentyl) these cis conformers have equivalent calculated energies
(within 2.2 Kcal/mol), see Figures 20-22, which agrees with budotitane isomer interconversion shown by
NMR/2/. Also (Q)Ti(OMe) conformers show similar energies (within 2.8 Kcal/mol). In contrast, the CIS1

conformer of (QT)2Ti(OMe)2 has markedly higher energy (56 Kcal/mol) than CIS2 and CIS3, likely due to
the bulky R4
substituent neopentyl.
In both (QB)2Ti(OMe)2 and (Q'r)2Ti(OMe)2 structures, the O(methoxy) atoms form the shortest bonds and
their opposite bonds are weakened. This trans influence is coherent with that experimentally observed for
O(oxo) atoms in [(QB2)Ti(t-O)]4 /28/. For (QT)2Ti(OMe) (CIS3) these data correspond to the pair of
opposite bonds Ti-O3 1.801 A, Ti-Ol 2.084 A, and Ti-O4 1.816 A, Ti-O51 2.046 A. Completing the
coordination sphere are 20(acyl) atoms opposite each other; here there is no dominant trans influence and
both Ti-O(acyl) bonds are equal (Ti-O2 1.994/l, Ti-O52 1.992/l). For the Ci derivative a lengthening of
the Ti-CI bond is expected due to the larger covalent radius/28/of CI (0.99 A) compared with that ofO (0.73
A) in methoxy monomers. However, calculated values of about 0.42 A overshadow the difference between
CI and O radii (0.26 /). A partial double bond character of the Ti-O(methoxy) bonds in Q2Ti(OCH3)2
explains this feature and the consequent stronger Ti-chelate bonds induced in (QV)_TiC12, see Table 1.

Therefore, the trans influence provides the driving force for structural features in titanium 4-acyl-5-
pyrazolonates. The oxygen atoms O(oxo) in [(Qa)2Ti(-O)]4, and O(methoxy) in Q2Ti(CH30)2, Q Q'r and
Qa, are strongly bound to Ti, with the shortest Ti-O bonds. This results in the lengthening of their opposite
Ti-O bonds in the coordination sphere.
CONCLUSIONS
The role of asymmetry in octahedral antitumor Ti -diketonates may be related to some weak bonds that
such compounds have, like the Ti-O(acyl) bond in [(Qa)Ti(t-O)]4 or those opposed to Ti-O(methoxy) in
Q2Ti(OMe)2. Their cleavage may favor formation of stronger Ti-electrophile bonds, or induce hydrolysis, etc.
Such interactions with transferrin may be critical to activity. Novel Ti drug development may come from the
investigation of polynuclear species as suggested by active related derivatives of budotitane and titanocene
dichloride, and the more recent [(Qa)zTi(t-O)]4. Several polynuclear Ti derivatives here analyzed show
markedly short Ti-O(oxo) bonds and large Ti-O(oxo)-Ti bond angles resulting from high s-character of the
O(oxo) binding. The short Ti-O(methoxy) bonds in mononuclear methoxy derivatives behave similarly.
Useful formulations for these poorly water-soluble species are required; such an approach was successful for
[(Q)2Ti(-O)]4 through a liposome/11/.
